Barbie Sunday
show cancelled

What are we going to do now ?

I'll think of something.

Cold Pizza And
A Warm Puppy

What's funny?
Russ didn't tell you ?

Tell me about the job,
but he didn't tell me anything funny.

He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No . Who is Pete ?

Well, it seems there's this physician type
character named Pete was all depressed one day.

He felt terrible because he did some stuff
he just couldn't get over.

What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.

But Pete wasn't 
the worst guy in the universe

because no matter how hard he tried to
forget about it, he couldn't.

The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism

was overwhelming.

But every once in a while,
he heard a voice inside

that said:
" Pete, don't worry about it. "

You weren't the first licensed practioner 
that sleeps with one of your patients

and you won't be the last.

Besides, you're single.

Let it go.

But then , just when he was almost over with
the guilt and all,

another voice would bring him back down to reality

and said, " Oh Pete ,

but dude,

you're a veterinarian! "

Vi !

Let's go !

What are you doing ?

I don't get it.
Don't get what ?

What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .

You mean the veterinarian man ?
Yea, that guy. I don't get it .

He sleeps with his patients .

His patients are probably
cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.

Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats

I used to nap with all the time. 
I think it's sweet.

Actually, don't worry about it , partner.

There're plenty of other jokes in 
the universe that we can share .

Let's just get
ready for tonight.

Some well deserved vacation.

I got a good one for you, Violet .
Lay it on me!

Oh damn!

What?
I think I forgot it .

But that's the good thing, Daze;
I'll be here when it comes back to you .

Ten, nine , eight,

seven ,

six ,

five ,

four

three ,

two

One!

What happened over there?

Well...

I was just thinking that,
since how you're 18 and all,

you can be charged as an adult now,
for all felonies.

Kid's meal, ferris wheels...
God knows what else.

I know.

But hey, this should turn that around.

I've invited the Boss
to our party.

"Dear Daisy,

I'm sorry I couldn't be at
your birthday party

but I hope you have
a wonderful day. Chet . "

it was swell of you
to invite him.

Hello?
Oh, hey Russ.

Is that Russ calling us
to wish us a happy vacation?

Because if it's not,
he has got the wrong number.

Oh ...
Ur...

I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .

Vi ?
No fucking way!

Violet says no.
Violet says " Fuck NO !"

I thought you said
we had some down time ahead.

No, Violet told me
you would pull something like this.

Oh, yea , no kidding.
She said you'll do that too.

Up the money and call it 
an easy gig!

That's textbook, Russ!
What you think we're, stupid?

Yes ! Same me to you!

Oh, can you believe him?
Look at here , Daze.

Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.

Be your best in my 
new signature dress.

Let them know you mean business
at the disco or in the boardroom ,

with the amazing versatility
of the premier piece

in my high-end line
of super stylish couture .

Who is better than you, girl ? 

Oh man !

How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.

How do you know ?
I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper 
has got one

and everybody was talking about it.
Let's get us ours'.

We can't.
Why not?

Because we blew the money 
on rent again.

Still, we might still have enough
for just one dress and then maybe ...

What?

Again , Vi ?

Call Russ back
before he gives the job away.

We got it.
But...

He said it was an easy gig.
right?

Yea.
Up the money too, didn't he?

Yea.

Then what are we waiting for?

That's shit!

Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy.
I know what we said,

but we have changed our mind and we...
we reconsidered your offer.

And we think that actually it
would go down quite well, because, er...

see...that day that you talked about...
( indistinct muttering )

Um...deeper, baby , deeper ...

Ow, gross!
You weren't suppose to like it!

oh...like I never do it, princess.

Have you gals heard about this guy?

O.k , so basically there was
this guy that stole some shit from Chet.

What did this guy take from him?
A truck full of cologne.

Now, this truck contains something 
in addition to just cologne

Something like what?
A bag full of money.

The weird part is that
the guy called us up and then 

have the stones to taunt us 
after he did what he did.

Stones...
Or some kind of death wish .

Coz he obviously gave us his address .

His name and number
were clear as day,

the whole time
he was fucking with us .

Cold Pepper lives about three 
blocks from this dude.

She has checked him out.

Says he's leaving in the morning
comes back in the afternoon.

When he comes home,
you'll be waiting for him.

And that's that.

The landlord is on our team,
so the door will be open.

Better be! 
Relax! The door will be open .

And you don't have to worry 
about the noise either.

Why not?
The building's almost empty.

Switching over to condos
or some kind of gentrification or 
some kind of shit.

make sure that this guy
is working alone , Ross.

Pretty sure. landlord says
the guy is a loner .

This happen tomorrow.

Can you handle it?
Of course we can handle it.

You got the specs' ?

Now we good ?

Yea , we're good.

Come on, Daze.

Do you gals know about 
Barbie Sunday's new dress ?

Yea, we know.
Just checking.

Daze !

Yea ?

Happy Birthday!

Thanks , Russ.

If you keep an eye on your partner, 
you might be around to see her next one.

Fuck off, Russ!

Ask her about Rose.

I said : Fuck off, Russ!

Who's Rose?

My old partner.

I thought I was your only ...
Sorry, Daze .

Well, what happened to her?

She died.
How?

Got shot.
How?

The usual way.

Somebody pointed a gun at her
and pulled the trigger .

Who?
It's complicated.

Well, it all kind of makes sense now.
Why ?

You talked about her in you 
sleep some times.

I do ?

Yea.

Dreaming Flowers

Vi ?
Yeah, man

I can't wait until
we get the dresses.

Things are going to change 
for us after that.

Oh hell yeah !

Do we need to chain it up?
Nah. This'll do .

If you touch you DIE

Cool?
Cool.

This really is the last time 
I'm going to say this to you...

Okay ? Or anything else.

I don't want you to send me 
anything anymore.

I don't...I threw out the flowers.

You can't fix it!

And I'm really done with you.

I don't want to talk to you again,
I don't want to hear from you again.

I want you to leave me alone.

Please . Okay ? You don't know
how to fix this.

You can't fix it!

You...have no clue...

Just leave me alone.

I don't ever want to hear from you again.

Wake me up when the latch turns.

But what if ...

This isn't exactly the residence of
a renegade, Daze .

But...
Just keep a lookout while I
go dream about a dress.

Him

Oh my God,
is that the guy?

What's going on ?
I don't know !

Why didn't he take our guns ? 
I don't know !

Should we wake him or
just pop him ? 
I don't know, Daze .

Hey, girls.

There's stuff in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

Do you know why we're here ?
Yes, I've been expecting you.

I think there must be some sort 
of misunderstanding.

We're not here
to clean your bathtub,

or organise your closets or
make you happy.

Really?

Yea.

We are here to kill you.

Then there's no misunderstanding at all.

Do you mind if I've a word
with my partner ?

Wait a second.
Search him, Daze.

He's clean, Vi.

Come on then.

This isn't going much like 
the picture by... 
Yea, I know.

204,
I wish
it would be more like a normal job.

Now it's weird!

206,
I never really talked 
to a job before.

Listen...this might be 
some kind of a test.

Everything is a test
when you're a career woman.

Damn right .

And thoses dresses aren't
going to buy themselves.

I got it! What?
I know what we can do! What?

Why don't we just go in there,
blast him without thinking about it ?

That way, we don't have 
to think about it.

214,
We don't even have to look either because
we never going to miss at that distance.

That's a good plan, Daze.
A real good one!

You think so?
Totally!

Cool.

But don't aim too high.
Why not?

We don't want to hit that little bird.

Oh, yea, good thinking.

Okay, ready?

Ready!
Let's do it!

Who wants a snack?

Be careful, they're hot.

Um ... No, thank you.

Don't you like cookies?
Yea, but ...

I feel kinda bad now.

Don't be ridiculous.
Are those oatmeal ?

Thanks, mister.

What's wrong ?

Wait a minute,
did you put something in these ?

Why are you looking 
at us funnny ?

No, no...no

It's just that you girls 
are not what I expected.

We didn't picture you either.

Keeps life interesting I guess.

Do you've any milk ?

I hate to interrupt or anything but...

don't you think you girls 
should better reload ?

Excuse me,
but what is your deal ?

I rather not discuss it.

Why not?
That's my business, that's why why not.

What's the big...

I thought for sure they'll send professionals.
They did !

Then why is that matter
I don't want to discuss ?

Wouldn't you be curious 
if you were us?

There's a place around the corner
if you need more ammo.

We got ammo!
Then let's get this show on the road!

I'm expecting company.

What kind of company ?
I'd rather not say.

except to say that we probably 
don't want to be here when they arrived.

They ? Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?

Whatever , man.
Do you got any more cookies ?

Maybe. Maybe not.

How about this. If you shoot me,
I'll tell you where they are,

and I'll throw in the recipe.
How're you going to do that dead ?

Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.

Excuse me, I need to
confer with my colleague .

Again?
Yea. Again.

Don't worry, I won't move this time.

I'll be right here
when you get back.

I know we have to off this guy 
coz that's what we got to do,

but I don't want to do it until 
I know why he wants us to do it.

I mean, something's wrong here.
What's this, Daze ?

I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack
a truck chucked full of cash and cologne

to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.

I want this guy's story but
getting it will just make our job harder.

I mean it changes everything.

that's why they don't name any other 
pigs on a sausage farm.

And for that reason I think we 
shouldn't talk to him anymore.

That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.

He sure is.
How about those cookies? Oh man !

Have you ever had anything 
like that in your whole life ?

If we were rich
and didn't have to kill him,

we could pay him just to make 
those cookies for us, all the time.

Hell, what if the cookies
are just the tip of the iceberg ?

What if he makes brownies ?

We get so fat,
but it'll be so worth it!

Anyway,
Let's just do it as we said before...

I would just run in there,
blast him.

You bring anymore ammo?
No.

I thought you said you have some more.
Nah...I just wanted to sound pro and said I did.

It's not like we're facing five 
or six jokers

who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclub.

Beside, I was trying to
save up for the dresses.

Never got the hang of these.

I must be tiring your bucket list,

but I wouldn't sweat it!

Where is that place again ?

What place ?
The place...where you said 
we can get the bullets.

I thought you had some.

I was mistaken.

I've got a pretty
good steak knives ...

just trying to help .

You go out the front door.
You hook a right.

Then walk three blocks,
straight down on this side 
of the street.

You can't miss it.

I'll go, Daze.
Why can't I ?

'Cause you look 12
and I've ID.

They might actually check 
in this part of the town.

Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone,
and remember what I said.

302,
Okay.

You guys need anything ?

No, we're good.

So how long have you two been friends?

306,
I'm not suppose really to talk 
to you any more, so ...

Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.

But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.

You have one new message.

This really is the last time 
I'm going to say this to you...

Okay ? Or anything else.

I don't want you to send me 
anything anymore.

313,
I don't...I threw out the flowers.

314,
You can't fix it!

And I'm really done with you.

I don't want to talk to you again,
I don't want to hear from you again.

I want you to leave me alone ...

Um... me and Vi have been
friends for a pretty long time...

Maybe three years.

What?

You asked how long we have 
been friends a minute ago.

Oh yes .

Right.

We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?

Yea.

326,
It was that dull hospital 
over at Lexington.
Know it?

No.

We were doctors.
I mean, surgeons.

329,
Violet tells me to say surgeons.

Working in hospital never gave 
me bad dreams, that's for sure.

Anyway,
she is my best friend ever.

I kinda worry about her sometimes
though.

Half the time,
I wished I was more like her.

And then...

What?

I don't know.

She reminds me of my daughter.

Is that her on the phone machine?

But it's not important.

Is it, but...

don't let it distract you.

What's with that...
What's with what ?

The numbers you two wear.

These?
Yes.

Oh, that's our rank.

Officially, I'm killer number 9 
and Violet is killer number 8.

And how do you move up?

Making hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.

349,
Who is number 1?

No one ever seen him.

But he once killed three ninjas...

with a finger nail file.

Violet's Odyssey

Who's this?

There's a place about two blocks 
out from you.
It looks ike a hardware store.

If it is closed,
that's only what the sign says.

Hold on hold on, 
I'm going to take a piss.

Oh what else is new...

The moment each time 
I might need to take a piss,
you got to take a piss!

Not every time.
God damn it,

every single time I got to take a piss,
you got to take a piss!

You're not suppose to look down
or you can't (stood?) like a man, okay ?

I didn't!
You're looking down,
I saw you look down!

I'm looking at your face!
My man, why are you looking 
at me at all?

You get me worried 
about you sometime.
Don't you know...pee like a man?

Death's Door
Let's hope she hurries.

What's the big deal?
Who's coming over?

Is not important.

It's not like I'm asking you to tell me
where you stashed that money or anything.

I'm expecting company because 
of something else I did.

What else did you do?

I robbed somebody.

Somebody else...that's not our boss?

Yea.

Who?

Donnie Daffo.
Oh my...!

Then you really are serious
about getting yourself killed.

I figure it's people who
visits me today as well.

Small world because er...me and Vi
hate those guy's guts.

Two months ago
Vi ran into them

and they locked her in a dumpster.

It looked like someone had taken 
the life out of her.

Is that all they did?

You mean...
locked her in that trash can?

Well, yeah , I mean,
that's all she told me.

What else would they...

Russ is such an ass.

Thinks he's smart
but he is not.

Nothing to say this time ?

Maybe you might have
learned your lesson after all.

I'd like something to have you
tell your boss.

In this fucking economy
that chicken shit must be pretty hard up

to send a little cunt like you

to do a man's job.

395,
Fuck you later!

The hardware store you're looking for

is right around the corner.

Hi .
We're closed. What do you want?

I don't know what you're talking about.
Yea, you do.

The black door in the back.

Much obliged.

How can I help you ?

Let's go, let's go, come on.

Move fast.
Check on those boxes right over there.

Let's go, come on.

"But dude,
you're a vegetarian ! "

Oh...
See ?
Oh...ah

Tat...tat...

One, two, three , four, five...
I demand to fight thumb .

Alright...???

No, you go first!
No ...you are ... 

...( indistinct reply )

Hey!

Look who's here?

We just saw your stupid 
little girl friend

had to tell about herself.

You should see the face.

Just this one we had to wack 
out a couple of quiet rounds.

Yea...and we took our time doing it too.

Your stupid little girlfriend looked 
scare more than those two 
fagggots put together .

Even when things are getting up before them.

Step aside, Joe babe.

Well, don't, if you want to be a tough guy 
and see what happens to you!

Do it, do what they say, Daisy.

Can I ask you fellows something?

Nah, forget it.
Come on.

Excuse me?

Please .

Everybody!
Please.

Very good !

But I won't get into it until
you hold through the hardware!

Why would we do that ?
So you don't get tired .

What do you think we are, stupid?
Of course I think you're stupid!

That's the point!

You're going to have enough trouble keeping up with what I'm going to tell you as it's.

If you tug it out too
we'll be wasting everybody's time.

You don't want mama's good 
wrist? go to waste, do you?

Heck, I'll be surprise if your 
arms aren't burnt already

for keeping us at 
guns' point for so long

I mean. it's not like we're
packed or anything, what're you afraid of?

Felt better ?

Alright, where was I ?
You're going to ask us something.

Oh, that's right. Thanks.

Okay. So, here it goes...

My partner weighs in 
at about 95 pouds, right ?

And together you guys are pushing
half a ton, give or take, correct ?

So, did you need much help 
stuffing her into that garbage can ?

Now...

I usually don't talk to people
like you in the first place,

but if I did that sort of thing,

I would say you girls
should have your own TV show.

And that they should call that program
"The Adventures of Donnie Bitches " .

But like I said, it's tough.

I usually don't talk
to people like you.

Because talking to people 
like you doesn't make much sense.

What do you mean,
" people like us ? " 

What the hell kind 
of people are we ?

Dead ones.

Ha...ha...What?

Found some bullets.
But now I might be out again.

I don't know about you, partner,
but I think I'm hearing something.

Something like what ?

The " Internal Bleeding Dance " !

I could sure use some help too.
You got it, partner!

No but I want the fat one !
They're all fat , beat it !

Say mister,

You got any other leads
where I can get some more bullets?

The other place got turned into 
a crime scene, long story.

So just keep thinking on it, 
okay ?

Are you expecting anybody else ?

Are you sure ?

It might be back up 
for Donnie's crew.

Maybe they suppose to call in,
you know, like we do.

Then why don't they just 
come right in if everybody else has?

I don't know...who the hell is it.
I'm out of bullets again!

I'll get it.

What? Wait but
what if it's Donnie's other guys?

I know what they'll do.
I thought you wanted us to kill you ?

You jealous ?

Kinda.
Now take the fire escape. I'll stall them.

Otherwise they'll kill us all 
after they saw what happened in here.

Go !

You should come too !
No, no, I shouldn't .

This way I buy you some time. 
Go !

Please .

Go, go , go!

Everything okay in there?
I thought I heard something .

Fine... Dolores .

How've you been ?
I thought I heard something .

You know what, I did too. 
Sounds like it's coming from upstairs again.

I was sure it's coming from here.

Did you try next door ?
Are you sure everything is okay in there?

Yes.

I really should go now, Dolores.

You take care.

But I...
Dolores...

Dolores...

Take care.

Couldn't get me right,
so...!

115th Precinct,
Officer Minocha speaking.

There's something wrong 
at the apartment down the hall from me.

Then we'll have to take care 
of him too, you know ?

I know.

I think we should do it now .
Why ?

He's sleeping.
It'll be merciful.

I thought we're out 
of bullets again.

We're...but I can run out
and get some more somewhere real quick.

We couldn't even do it now 
even if we had the bullets.

Why not?
I don't know.

He said,
he wanted to see it coming.

When?
While you were out.

Did he say anything else ?
Like what?

Like why he wants to check out that bad.

A little .
Well ?

He...has got bad cancer .

It's in my pancreas and it's spreading.

Going to die and I rather 
not take the scenic route.

I don't think he has 
anybody who loves him either.
It must be even worse.

We should think about 
going to his funeral.

You know, just so that there's someone there.

What?

What ?

At the end of the day, 
Donnie will send the surviving member 

of his squad and
finish the job, either way.


So if it's not us doing this,
it'll be somebody else!

and besides, 
this guy is dead already!

In fact, it's way better
if we're the one doing it

because unlike Donnie's punks,

we are not going to 
torture him for 8 or 9 hours first.

Did you hear something?

What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.

What's with the " E " chilled ?

This ?
Yea .

I've been deputised.
I'm serious , Vi. 
Fine!

I had a little incident
while I was out getting the bullets.

Do you want to talk about it?
Are you interested?

Always.

So the second I get the lead,

three desperado storeman 
holed up the the spot.

First I'm thinking,
I'm just going to lay low and I'll 
be free and let this shit be.


Then , one of them sees me
and gets the bright idea

that they should rob me too.

So I proceeded to inform the perv
and his pals

about multiple ways in which 
they might violate their mothers.

So while they were trying to 
figure out where I got the balls,

the cops showed up.

Was it because the place
has a silent alarm ?

No.

Was it because the cops
just got lucky ?

Hell no!

This place is a stone's throw
from the 115th Precinct!

So the minute I 
remembered that little detail,

I'm thinking one or two things.

These desperados are either
stupid or crazy as all hell.

Whatever the case,
the cops apprehended the whole crew,

and then one of the 
fuzzy-wuzzy asked me if I was okay.

So I said, " Officer ,

how do you know
I wasn't in on it ? "

What makes you think
a girl cannot be in on it?

Next thing I hear,

is " Bang, bang , bang ! "

The guy behind the register flips
and start shooting at the pervs.

It seems the other gunner 
beneath the counter took the robbery personally.

Well long story short,

just about everybody 
ended up taking a shot or two,

except for yours truly.

That's how I got this one chilled on me.

It was blasted off 
the portal and just landed there.
Scout's honor.

Anyway, right about then,
I thought it might be prudent to exit

the premises through the rear.

Some days, you just can't 
get a bullet to save your life.

And here above all places.

I mean , shit,
this is America , right?

But...how did you get so dirty?

I slipped on a banana peel 
at an alley way coming back. 

Let's go see about the dresses.

How are you gals holding up?

Fine.

Fine. We're out of 
bullets again, you know ?

Why don't you use 
one of those guys's gun?

They seem to have plenty.

Why didn't the hell I think of that?

These guys got everything Daze !

Even a little ??? for your purse.
You know, the blue one ?

This's like Christmas !

Oh, I got you...
Idiot !

Take your pick, mister.

Why don't you decide?

Okay, let's see...

I'm going to go with the .38 , 
Daze.

Alright, you ready, Mister ?

Sure .

Okay.
Here goes nothing.

Hadi Haha .

What?

Are you done yet?

Come again?

I said , " Are you done yet ? "

What are you talking about?

You're...seriously going to do it,
were you ?

I most certainly was...

With that piece ?

Yea !

Suit yourself.
Why...shouldn't I ?

It is unprofessional.

How is that?

Forensics.

Forensics ?
Yea !

Forensics. Ballistics.

There's a real good chance 

those dorks will foul everything up for us
if we do it like this.

I mean Donnie's guys 
can even wind up with the credit 

if they traced the gun ,

and boss try to 
weasel out of paying us .

Even worse, we might 
get blamed for every corpse in here.

And boss would chaff us to the hill
and account the unnecessary roughness.

Not to mention the gang war
we might already started.

And it's not even like we can
switch out the bullets

because the caliber wouldn't
begin to match the ones in our styles and rods.

So, like I said, you can do it
your way if you want to, but ...

we risk looking unprofessional
and getting screwed...

out of a couple of hot dresses.

Good thinking , Daze .
Forensics will fuck you.

You would've thought of it too, Vi .

Yea , maybe.
I need a smoke.

You do that ?

When did you start doing that ?

I don't know.

Where did you get those?

Oh, from those guys.

You mind if I smoke in your place, mister?
Yea.

Yea, you mind or yes it's okay?
Yea, I mind.

Actually...
do what you like.

It don't matter anyway.

I'll take it out to the stairs.

Oh, Violet , you might 
want to wipe your prints off those pieces .

Put them back on the floors.

Sounds good , Daze .

Come on, sit down,
I want to show you something.

You know you probably be a millionaire 
if you clean your ears out more often.

No, ah !

Here .

Now what're you going to tell me?

Yea, the secret...

you were going to tell me.

Can I ask you something ?

Why is she so mad at you ?

She's your friend, you tell me.
I'm not talking about Violet !

She blames me for something.
For what?

Her mother's death.
Why, did you kill her?

No, no...she died 
after she left me.

Why did she leave you?
She didn't love me.

Why didn't she love you?
I don't know, Daisy.

I don't think people have
a lot of control over that sort of things.

As a husband I wasn't 
much of a price anyway.

Whatever the case,
she...felt in love with some one else.

Who?

A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.

I only saw him once...

from a distance.

They died in a car accident.

How did your daughter 
figure that it's your fault?

Well, my daughter
didn't know about the affair.

She blamed me for the breakup

and consequently the...
car accident.

Well, did you
ever tell her the whole story?

No .
Why not ?

Because I want her to remember 
her mother the way she does now.

That's stupid.
You are stupid.

Thank you .
Did your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

What?
Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

Very much.

At least you did something right.

Now, I'm going to get some bullets
and be done with all these.

Tell Violet.

Photosynthesis

You like my partner, don't you?

What's there not to like?
She's a...sweet girl.

Do you like her better than me ?

I don't know you as well.

That's okay.

I like her better than me too.
She might even think she can

keep you alive for 
some silly reasons. Kids.

May I ask you a question, Violet ?
You may ask.

You ever miss a doll house?

Not particularly.

And I think I know
what you're driving at, mister.

But this job never got to me,

aside from the 
sensational rush of the action.

What about those men?
What men?

The ones you killed.

That...was fucking magical.

Did you see that ?

Is a bit early to know
but career wise,

that little miracle,
might be my Mona Lisa .

If not, my Billie Jean.

Actually...
Do you have family?

What?

Do you have any family?

What a random question!
Well, do you?

Daisy is like family.

You didn't answer the question.

I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?

When was the last time 
he and you spoke?

What do you care?
That long, huh?

Are you afraid of what is next ?
You mean getting shot ?

I mean after that.

708,
I haven't thought about it.

And ?

I haven't come up
with anything conclusive .

I'm not an expert or anything
but I have a theory.

Hmm?

I figure...

I figure heaven 
is probably a place where

Nobody cares how big
or small you are or what you look like.

People probably
don't even have bodies.

They're just maybe like...
essences or something.

But if they do have bodies,
everybody got to to be naked for sure.

because that's how we all 
show up here in the first place, right?

And, also if you've a back problem,

or bad knees 
or self-esteem issues,

that stuff wouldn't 
bother you anymore up there.

And everything is free too,

or at least wholesale.

I don't know if there are animals
but that would be cool .

Oh yea,

and when you walk into the gate,
it's for the very first time.

They're probably playing
that Louis Armstrong's song.

Something nice like that.

Part of it came
from this girl I knew.

She died.

It's a long story.
Anyway she finds everybody

would be naked up there,
that was her idea.

How did she die ?
I don't want to talk about it !

I mean,
I do but,

when I tried it never works.

Maybe someday.

Wow...

Sit up...

Who wants some snack ?

You know what?

Wow!

What?

I don't think 
there're enough holes here 

from the first time 
Daisy and I came out blasting.

Is that important ?

Could be.

In any case, I've a feeling like 
my partner is not exactly holding up her end.

I've never...

actually...

really ever killed anybody.

I've been using blanks.

I just make sure 
me and Violet never share ammunition.

I guess that...she's so fierce
and thorough on a job,

I can pack a squirt gun
it just won't matter!

How do you mean 
holding up her end?

I mean that I might be 
the only one who taking out the trash.

Means that looks like
she might be packing blanks.

So what?

So what?
Yes, so what?

Even if she isn't taking people out,
isn't it better that she is with you?

You think your problem's of
having two targets instead of one

might save you behind a time or two

Do you understand ?
She's risking her life as well ?

Do you think
your...your friendship

might have helped 
keep you sane

as you wonder through this life of yours?
There's still the principle.

We have rules
and what she meant happened to her,

is a big No No,
no matter how you sliced it.

Coz one day you're packing blanks
and the next you're wearing a wire.

So what are you gonna do about it?

I'm going to have to take her out
if my suspicion is true.


I thought
Daisy was your friend.

I'm not saying I'm going to like it.

I thought you said she's like family

She is.

But she is a businesswoman too
so she will understand.

I was figure to 
check it out first anyway,

Why?
Because that's how it usually goes
for the big ones.

You got a hair dryer?

Rose Again

If you touch you DIE 

Unit 42 , come in.

Unit 42,
respond to dispatch.

You just missed her.

Daze ?
She just left.

Who?

Rose.

Was she alive?
I don't know.

She asked about you.

What did she say ?

She said :
" I'm looking for your partner. "

Those were her exact words.

Is that all she said ?
No .

She said that roses were dead,
and violets were too.

She split after that
and that's the end of it.

How long have you been here ?

She's taller than I thought.

How long have you been here, Daze ?

I can't really tell.

Time is spent up now,
so I don't know.

I keep missing my flights.

What's that?

Oh, that ?

That's his,
the guy's.

Rose is back.

Nine Divided by One

Hello, Number 9.

Oh my !

Are you... ?

Wow!

I always figure you were...
You always figure I was what ?

Imaginary.

Or a boy.

Do you know what I've been doing today ?

I've been watching you 
and your partner.

Did you hear something?

That partner of yours 
is clean out of her mind.

She's going to put 
us all in a real bad spot.

We can't let that happen.

I can't let that happen.

I won't let that happen.

Do you even know what grief 
her little sloth is going to cost us?

Well, I 'll tell you.

Two the idiots that she went to
??? with were engaged.

Do you know who 
they're going to marry?

The Police Chief's step-daughters. 

And you can bet the house once
they sort out all these rubbish ,

Boss is going 
be held accountable.

Next to that, a garden variety
gang war would be a Sunday stroll.

There's dead guys 
at the bottom of the steps .

He saw me !

Can I ask you a question, mam' ?

Do you always work by your self ?

Yes.

Is it lonely?

What's that to you?

Just wondering.

Well then, let's get 
back to business

because I'm late
for my ballet class.

Finish the job
or face the consequences.

Am I clear ?

Well...

I got news for you, Number 1.

Given the situation , I see
why are you T.O. and all,

But what's done is done.

And my partner comes first.

What's that suppose to mean ?
It means,

that you try to take her out 
or get in the middle of our job,

you're in a world of hurt !

I know what you are capable of
but we are pros too.

We also know that
you're coming now.

Do you know what I wanted 
to be when I was your age ?

I don't either.

I like you, kid.

You're in over your head

and you're scared yet you look death 
in the eye without blinking.

It's admirable
but it won't save you.

It won't save your partner

and it won't save your new pal.

Finish the job 
or face the consequences.

You got an hour.

Sorry about that stuff
I said before.

What stuff?

When I called you 
stupid and stuff.

That's okay.

Did you find anymore 
bullets all around?

Hey.

Want to hear something?

Your daughter doesn't hate you.

How do you know?

I know.

How could you?

You never even met her.

It don't matter.

I still know
she doesn't hate you.

How ?

I'm a daughter too.

Vi ?

She left.

Where did she go ?

To get more bullets.

Listen carefully, Daisy.

When she comes back,

I need for you 
the one to put me down.

It's very important.

Why me ?

Because you and I
are friends, right?

I guess, but ...
Will you promise me then?

890,
I can't.
I need you to promise me.

But I can't .
I need you to do this for me.

I can't!
I need you to do this for me !

No, I can't!
Don't argue with me, April !

But I'm Daisy.
Just don't argue with me, girl !

You promise me!

Say it.

I promise.
You promise ?

I said I would, didn't I ?

I've something to show you.

I tried to give it to my daughter
but she...threw it back at me .

I think you're about her size.

Would you try it on ?

I'll wait in the other room.

Immortality

Got the bullets.

You'll be surprise 
how many places I...

What's going on?

How do I look?

Okay.
Where did you get it?

He gave it to me .

What for?

I don't know, Vi.

Can I talk to you a minute?

Have you lost your mind?

What is your problem?
You're my problem!

I'll let you borrow it some time
if that's what this is about.

Well it's not about the fucking dress!

Yeah, right.
That's exactly right!
 
You know what, Violet !
We don't know anybody

or get involved in stuff
or anything like that !

I never went to a prom !
You did but I didn't !

I'm glad you didn't!
Why ?

Because they would laugh at you !
How do you know ?

Because that's what they do,
if you're different.

Everybody isn't like that, Vi.
And so what if they laugh?

So what?
Don't tell me what I know.

You haven't been through things like me.

And I hope I'll never do,
if it makes me so scared!

I'm not scared!
Yes, you are, Violet.

You don't trust anyone
or anything.

You never did.

I trusted you !

What?

I said I trusted you !

When did you stop?

The second I saw that
god damn dress on your back!

That's just perfect then.

Why ?

Because now you don't
have anything at all.

So what are you trying to say ?
I just said it.

Say it again ,
if you have the guts.

You heard me !
I'm going to kick your ass !

Cut it off, bitch !
You're going to mess up my new dress !

My landlady was coming up the street.

I was just...

just messing with her .

Never shot a gun before.

How was it?
What you aiming for some new shoes now?

Shut up about it !
You shut up about it !

Make me !
I just did !

Oh, is that what you called it ?
Violet !

What?

I almost forgot I got...
something for you too.

Really?

Why are you giving this to me ?
You have a unique world view .

Now you can share it with others,

in a new way.

Thanks a lot, mister.

I need the police.

Yes, that's my address.

What are you doing?

He's writing a letter.

To who?

To " whom ".

To whom?

His daughter.

I'll do it.

What?

I'll write it for you.

Alright .

Thank you.

So, where was I?

" Dear April... "

That's it?

So far, yeah.

" Dear April,

I don't know
if you'll ever read this,

but I hope do.

In any case...

It's time we finally talk.

Please, take good care of yourself.

I managed, to put some money 
in your bank accounts.

Please use it
to continue your education.

Your mother would've wanted that too.

Don't worry about 
the dead men in the bathtub.

Is not... what it looks like

and a long a story 
to tell rihgt now.

Sometimes...

for no particular reason,

I think of you

and smile.

Usually about that day that...

we drove out to the mall

for your birthday.

Your mom had the flu,

and she said
to go on without her.

I remember you wonder off,

got lost,

and two hours later

we finally found each other.

We hugged,

you didn't want to let go.

Then we had ice cream

and we talked
all the way home.

I think that was
the happiest day I had.

I know I probably wasn't 
the best father in the world,

but I tried the best I could.

Anyway,

I loved you all
the the possibe way I can.


Love, Dad. "

Uh, " PS :

This isn't my handwriting,

because a friend of mine

wrote it out for me. "

If you just leave that in the...
apartment where you go, 
sure to get to her.

Glad you girls came by.

I wouldn't have
written that otherwise.

Daze...

We got to go now, Daze.

He never even
said his name, Vi.

Come on now.

The bike is gone.

I know.

Barbie Sunday Dresses Have Arrived!

Well, we got them.
Yeap.

It was off the menu.
Yeah, so is yours .

Hey, I know we never really talked
about stuff since that day .

Are we cool ?

Yeah, of course.

Precious.

Hey, you hungry or anything?

Not really.
I'm just going to take a walk .

Yeah, screw food.

I could use a nap
if you want to know the truth.

You want me to take your bag home ?

No?

This better not be Russ.

It's my dad.

Really ?

I tried to get the pizza place
but I...I pressed his number instead.

Long story.

Hang on a sec, Phil.

See you, Daze !

Hey Dad.

One More Thing

April ?

Are you umm...April ?

Hi. 

Hi. 

I was a friend of your father's.

I just want to tell you know that...

I was a friend of his and...

that he talked about you a lot.

He wanted me to give 
something to you too.

What's it?

It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.

For real ?
Yeah.

I think it should fit.

There's something else in there too.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Your father was a good guy, April.

He told me how you two got lost 
in the mall one day and then had ice cream.

Well,

see you.
