I'm Anna Troyev,
the art therapy instructor.

(DOOR LOCK BUZZING)

Arms up.

I trust we won't go through
this every day.

DOCTOR: Anna?

Welcome, are you ready
for your first day?
Hmm.

ANNA: I think so.
Please.

Do you live far?
Uh, somewhat, but it's worth it.

Always wanted to use art
to help people.

Wonderful.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
DOCTOR: Please.

This way.

Those are
our security procedures.

Learn them backwards
and forwards.

Most of our patients
are quite docile, but others--

ATTENDANT: Doctor, it's Leena.

She's not in her room.
Nobody can find her.

ANNA: Who's Leena?

Our most dangerous patient.

In fact, she's the reason
for the opening you're filling.

Your predecessor
underestimated her

and ignored protocol.

Did not end well.

Listen to me.
Do not leave this room.

Don't worry.
You will be safe here,

and I 'll come back
after we've found her.

ANNA: Please, please--

(PENCIL SCRATCHING)

ANNA: Hello, there.

(ANNA EXHALES)

ANNA: Does your mum
or dad work here?

Can I see?

I-- Is that me?


That's very good.

I'm Anna. What's your name?

(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

LEENA: Leena.

You didn't a--
answer me before.

Do your parents work here?

Why would you think that?

Because you're--
I'm what?

(DOOR BUZZES, OPENS)

DOCTOR: Leena?

(DOCTOR SPEAKS ESTONIAN)

(ANNA BREATHING SHAKILY)

Put it down.
(ANNA EXHALES)

Leena, put it down, now.


ANNA: <i>You didn't tell me</i>
<i>she was a child.</i>

DOCTOR: <i>That's because</i>
<i>she's not.</i>

Leena suffers
from a gland disorder

which causes, uh,
proportional dwarfism,

<i>essentially halting her growth</i>
<i>around age ten.</i>

<i>Make no mistake.</i>

Leena may look like a child,
but she is a grown woman.

Thirty one, to be exact.

When Leena first arrived,

<i>she struggled so hard</i>
<i>against her restraints</i>

that she would bleed severely.

It was a lesson for all of us

on the depths
of her will to be free.

Much of Leena's early life

was spent doing whatever
she could to survive.

But she never grew older,
at least not on the outside.

Imagine going through
your whole life,

the world seeing only a child.

It is very important that you
do not see her in that way.

<i>Leena uses her affliction</i>
<i>as much as she suffers from it.</i>

She's a exceptional con artist.

Two years ago,
Leena wormed her way

into this family by posing
as a runaway.

This family took her in.
They fed her. They clothed her.

<i>Normally, Leena would</i>
<i>simply steal whatever she could</i>

<i>and then disappear,</i>
<i>but this time,</i>

she, um...

Well, let me put it this way.

She lives here now.

Actually, a bunch of people
are getting together tonight.

Well, congrats.

GUNNAR: I'll, uh, see you guys
back at the house.

ALLEN: I mean, this was supposed
to be family night.

TRICIA: What, is he not supposed
to have fun with his friends?

ALLEN: Oh, God.
All he does is have fun.

No, Gunnar works his tail off.

he's fencing.

He's living his life.

Don't do that.

Esther's not coming back, Allen.

I miss her too. I do.

We have an update
on your daughter Esther.


FEMALE VOICE: <i>From the little</i>

<i>we believe a woman abducted her,</i>
<i>brought her to Russia</i>

<i>and passed her off</i>

We haven't gotten
many specifics yet.

Perhaps when
she's feeling safer,

she can shed some more light
on what she's been through.

We have a child therapist
that she'll be working with.

Good.

What she needs right now
is her family.

Be prepared for changes.

Four years is a long time
in the development of a child.

(PIANO PLAYING)

Esther?

Sweetheart, it's me.

It's Mommy.

Can I-- can I see you?

(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

Sweetie, it's--

it's Mommy.

I thought I would
never see you again.


TRICIA: Everything
is right, now.

It's been so long
since you've seen any of us.

Let's see if I can--
Oh, there's Daddy.

This was one
of our charity events.

He looked so handsome
that night, didn't he?

Can I grab you anything else?

No, thanks.

Oh, speak of the devil.

Your brother is probably a foot
taller than you would remember.

Oh, there's Mup-Mup.
She's been so good to us.

Oh, I can't wait to see her.

No, sweetie.

She passed. Remember?
It's just the four of us now.

I have to use the restroom.

How about we go home, huh?
LEENA: Yes.

We left it just as it was.

but we have a lot
of Christmases and birthdays

to make up for,

so just let us know

Okay, you can go in.

Dr. Segar will be right

I think it's too soon for you
to get involved, Detective.

I'd like to talk
to her alone first.

Look, I have to go.

DR. SEGAR: You have no idea

how happy I am to see you,
Esther.

Welcome home.

Well, now, you're certainly not
the little girl I once knew.

You're a young lady now.

Do you remember what I told you

when we first began
our sessions?

I told you
if I ask any questions

that make you uncomfortable,
we'll stop.

I wish my parents were like you.

How so?

LEENA: They keep asking
what happened to me,

but I'm not ready
to tell them about it.

DR. SEGAR: And that's
perfectly fine.

I am hoping you'll talk
to me about it,

but only when you're ready,
okay?

Having said that,

is there anything
you want to tell me

about your time away?

You want to play, Sydney?

I think Sydney wants
to play with me.

Hello, I remember you.

You remember me?

DR. SEGAR: Your turn.
Esther, you can wait out here.

I'm just going to need to talk
to your mom for a moment.

<i>Well, of course she's different.</i>

DR. SEGAR: <i>She has</i>

<i>Is that unusual,</i>

DR. SEGAR: <i>Not necessarily.</i>

<i>She was there a long time</i>

TRICIA: <i>Well, that's good,</i>

DR. SEGAR: <i>I did notice</i>

<i>Sydney was a macaw.</i>

<i>Bright orange</i>

<i>Yet, today, she addressed</i>

so much into one canvas,

you know? So, I resorted

So cool.

You haven't been in here
in a while.

No, I haven't.

What's this one?

Oh, no.

It's, uh, I should've
gotten rid of this.

LEENA: Who-- who's-- who's that?

There's no use
dwelling on the past.

You're home now.
That's all that matters, right?


So, I was thinking we could dust
off some canvasses, you know?

See what comes of it.

I would love to.
Yeah?

Um, what's your poison?
Oil, watercolors?

I-- I got it all.
Charcoal?

ALLEN: Charcoal? Okay.

Pick an object,
and-- and we'll sit down

and we'll--
we'll draw it together.

I want to draw you.

You want to draw me?
Mm-hmm.

ALLEN: Yeah, okay.

Well, this is a first.

How do you want me?

I can-- I can do The Thinker.

That's not a place
I want to live anymore.

Esther should tell her story

from our little town,

and that remains a concern.

if there's still a danger.

this morning.

to group discussion
tomorrow morning,

just to see
if everything's all right.

DONNAN: We'll do it
the following day, then.

It's important.

I mean, sure. If it's
that important, we'll be there.

but you didn't.

Why is that?

You're thinking bigger, right?
Play the part, manipulate us,

and a year from now we meet
with some tragic accident.

Am I getting warm?

Let me go.
You'll never see me again.

TRICIA: That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

We can't have Esther
disappear twice now, can we?

She didn't disappear.

TRICIA: There was nothing
that I could do for her,

it was too late.

Gunnar, he was always
way too rough with her.

That night he just went too far.
What was I supposed to do?

Hand over the only child
I had left over some

sibling bullshit
that went too far?

I loved my daughter
with all my heart,

but a mother protects
her family, no matter what,

and if you think... (CHUCKLES)
...that I'm going to let some

psycho dwarf destroy
what I have built...

you're mistaken.

<i>This family came over</i>
<i>on the fucking Mayflower</i>

<i>and built this country.</i>
<i>We matter. Allen matters.</i>

<i>When he got the news</i>
<i>Esther was alive,</i>

the happiness on his face,
I had to make this work.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Allen doesn't know
what happened to Esther.

And you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does.

<i>There's only one thing worse</i>
<i>than the death of a child,</i>

<i>and that is a child</i>
<i>who is missing.</i>

Esther's disappearance
changed Allen,

changed who he was,
who he is supposed to be,

but you are the answer.

(BOTH GRUNT)

TRICIA: <i>You and I have a chance</i>
<i>to turn this mess</i>

<i>into a mutually</i>
<i>beneficial arrangement.</i>

Esther's down there, isn't she?


Don't you fucking say her name.

Okay.

TRICIA: You conned your way
into my family.

You chose this role,

and now you're gonna
fucking play it.

So, you can be Esther for now,

and live a life
that anyone would kill to have,

or you take the fall for this

and get shipped back
to Estonia in handcuffs.

What do you say?

(CAR APPROACHING)

LEENA: I'm sorry I scared you.
ALLEN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

We should have
never left you alone.

What happened?
She fell off her bike.

I found her by the side
of the road.

Honey, what are you doing
on a bike?

Come here, let's--
let's get warm.

Mom, I'm so sorry.
Stop.

What the fuck?
Yeah.

So what does this mean?

TRICIA: Well, it means
she's not a kid.

She is a grown woman
and we cannot underestimate her.

No, she's more than that,
Mother.

She's a psychopath living
in our fucking house.


So we just have to live
with this person?

I didn't say that.
So then, can we just, you know?

Make it look like an accident.

It's too soon.
We need to think about this.

So she just owns us now?

No, no, she has just as much
to lose as we do.

Look, neither of us
were expecting this.

So, for now we just
keep an eye on her,

and when the time is right,
we'll end it.

This is insane, even for us.

GUNNAR: Okay, see that?
It's gonna fire.

Uh-huh.
Pull it back. Just like that.

And you get the bow,
flip it in, slide it.

See this? Are you watching?
Yeah.

Yeah, and you--

ALLEN: Nice!

GUNNAR: You see that?
ALLEN: Yeah, yeah.

GUNNAR: That's what
I'm talking about.

TRICIA: Our meeting
with Dr. Segar is today.

A problem we wouldn't have
if you hadn't talked

to the parrot.

Sydney was a macaw.
Oh.

All macaws are parrots,

but not all fucking parrots
are macaws.

What are we gonna do about that?

Oh, we make her believe.
Together.

DR. SEGAR: One of our goals here
is helping Esther acclimate

back into life
within the family unit.

Part of that is remembering
your shared history.

Moments you had, the fun things
you did together before.

Mr. Albright, what's a memory
that means a lot

to you and to Esther?

Oh, God, there are so many.
(LEENA CHUCKLES)

Um, there was Christmas
in Paris.

The summer in Tuscany.

Yellowstone.
ALLEN: Yeah, that's up there.

I was six.

We saw bears and a-- a chipmunk
stole my sandwich.

Oh, my God.
There were so many chipmunks.

What else, Esther? Be specific.

We stayed at Elk Ridge Ranch
and rode horses.

Mine was a pony named Nugget

and Daddy's horse
was called Stretch,

and this one time when Stretch
leaned down to eat grass,

Daddy fell right over his head
onto the ground.

He had dirt all over his face.
It was even in his teeth!

ALLEN: I can't believe
you're telling this story.

TRICIA: Oh, my God.
It was in your teeth for days.

(LEENA LAUGHING)
(TRICIA LAUGHING)

In summary, Esther exhibits
a healthy outlook on life,

especially re-entering
into this family unit.

She is highly functioning,

emotionally well.

That is all.
(VOICE RECORDER BEEPS)

There are people
coming over today

just to see you.

They're friends of ours
who knew Esther.

So enough with the glowering,
okay?

Esther is a lady.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Hmm.

have to do some damage.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

TRICIA: Okay.

Think we did good.

Everyone expects Esther
to be broken.

What they really want
is a happy ending.

We are gonna pretend

that pink
is your favorite color.

Ooh, velvet.

The secret is to give them
a story they want to believe.

This one is my favorite.

What's your favorite color?
Pink.

Very, very good.

Now, you say you can paint.
What else can you do?

(LEENA PLAYS PIANO)

LEENA: I missed
my family very much.

It's lovely to be back.

WOMAN: And what are your plans
now, young lady?

What are my plans, Mummy?

Absolutely nothing.

I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

WOMAN: (CHUCKLES) Aw.

(LEENA SIGHS)

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)


GUNNAR: So let me get
this straight...

you're 30?

Get out of my room now, please.

GUNNAR: It's not your room.
It's my dead sister's room.

You're not her
and you never will be.

Is that perfectly clear?
Fuck off.

Watch your mouth, freak.

You know, I'm glad everything's
out in the open now,

'cause I'm done pretending
like you belong here.

You don't.

This is my house, my family,
it'll never be yours.

As long as you're
under this roof,

you and I will have
an understanding.

Here's what it is.

I fucking own you.


Do that again and I'll kill you
like I killed Esther.



One call from me,

and you're right back
in that gulag.

You'd go down, too.

Why, because of what
the illegal immigrant, fugitive,

mental patient said?

Good luck with that.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

This is America.

People like me matter,

and if you're not Esther,

that just means
Esther's missing again.

Mom has a problem with that.

I don't.

See you later, freak.

TRICIA: You are gonna sleep
like a fucking baby tonight.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

TRICIA: I made roast lamb
with rosemary and tapenade.

And I know Esther
doesn't like it,

so I made your favorite.

GUNNAR: Aw, just like
the old days.

ALLEN: I'm really excited
about going

into the city tomorrow.

I'm gonna show the gallery
what I've been working on.

That sounds wonderful.

ALLEN: Well, it's all thanks
to you.
Oh.

ALLEN: I rediscovered the joy
I once felt doing what I love.

I feel like a kid again.
You want to come?

LEENA: I would love to!

Oh, Esther and I
already have plans.

ALLEN: Oh.
What plans?

It's a surprise.

ALLEN: Okay, well,
another time then.

GUNNAR: It's great
that you're painting again, Dad.

ALLEN: Well, yeah.

May I be excused?

Oh, don't forget your--

You can eat upstairs. It's okay.

ALLEN: Honey, hey,
what's wrong?

Dad, she's fine.

TRICIA: Just give her
some space. She's fine.

Yeah, she's probably tired
from all that piano playing.

(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

(CLICKS TONGUE)

(DOOR KNOCKING)

Can I come in?
Mm-hmm.

Are you okay?
What happened down there?

I, uh, I don't really
like Mummy's cooking.

can you keep a secret?

I'm not crazy about it either.

Well, listen, um, nighttime's
my favorite time to paint.

You-- you want to come join me?

LEENA: Yes, I would love to.
ALLEN: I'll see you downstairs.

(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

This is a such a great space.
I'm glad you like it.

Every artist needs a space
to let their inner weirdo out.

We get to see beauty and passion

where others don't even know
to look.

I really like that.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)


ALLEN: Yeah,
I'm a messy painter.

Drives your mother crazy.

I think I'm-- I think
I'm done for the night.

Just turn the lights off.

Have a good night.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

TRICIA: Looks like
you two had fun.

He's right, you are talented.

He is something, isn't he?


Are you so utterly delusional
to think that he would want you?

"Surprise,
I'm not your daughter,

I'm a mutant grifter."

He would be as repulsed by you
as I suspect most men are.

Well, if you'll excuse me,

I'm gonna go upstairs
and fuck my husband.

He really is a new man
since you came back.

Thanks for that.

LEENA: Hey, you.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)



I think Esther's really bummed
about not coming

to the gallery with me.

Listen, I love
that you and Esther

have painting in common.
I just--

I don't have anything
like that with her.

I was hoping that I could
spend the day with her

and maybe we could
find something to share.

Plus, it would be good
for you to be focused, right?

I mean, if Sal likes
what he sees,

then maybe you get a show
and get back out there.

Yeah, okay.
We're not hurting, are we?

No, no. Not at all.

You are a great painter.

People miss seeing your work.

Thank you.


Is that bacon?

It's heaven.

Good morning, Daddy. Crepe?

ALLEN: Yes, please.
Is there anything you can't do?

LEENA: Mummy?

TRICIA: Oh, no, thanks.
I'm gonna make my usual--

Smoothie?

Greek yogurt, kale,
flax seeds, and lemon juice.

Just the way you like it.

Try it.

that hungry.

I'll-- I'll have it. Here.

No, this is special
just for mummy.

I made it for you.

Oh, sweetie,
that's so nice of you,

but I prefer to make my own.

ALLEN: Tricia, come on. Try it.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Good.

Mm, delicious.

ALLEN: Thank you.

(GAGS, COUGHS)

Tricia, you okay?
I'm good.

Yeah?

(GARBAGE DISPOSAL WHIRRING)

ALLEN: I know you wanted
to come with me,

but I think it'll be really
good for you to spend the day

with your mom. I wanted
to show you something, though.

Here.

It's the one in the center.

Dean at Woodley
is a friend of mine.

Woodley is the best
art school in the country.

You're scary good, Esther.
Can I show it to 'em?

I would love it. Thank you.

Can you bring this up
to the platform?

I'm just gonna get
some coffees for Mom and Dad.

Mm-hmm.

ALLEN: All right,
I'll see you up there.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)

Jesus Christ!
Watch where you're going, kid!

Does she belong to you?
TRICIA: Yes, she does.

What happened?
Oh, nothing. It's fine.

Esther tripped.
ALLEN: Sorry, it took forever.

No, no! Knock 'em dead, okay?
Yeah.

Daddy, take me with you!

ALLEN: Oh, honey, I wish.
Next time.

You're gonna miss your train.
All right, see you later, honey.

Ciao.


GUNNAR: Easy, Mom.

You think you can
fucking kill me?

Take this.

Tastes like fucking garbage.

Our arrangement is over.
You're fucking dead.

Hey!

Mom! Mom!



Open the God damn door. Esther!

Sweetie, come on.

Don't you dare!

<i>Allen as well.</i>

Okay, bye. Fuck!

You're okay. You're okay.

TRICIA: Thank you so much.

Oh, my goodness. Oh.



Esther's behavior has been
so erratic since she got back.

To be honest,
it's been really hard.

I mean, there's constant lying
and these outbursts of anger.

Sometimes she even jokes
about hurting herself

and I don't think
she's really joking.

You have her in therapy?
Yes, yes.

GUNNAR: Look who's back.

Get up. We're doing this. Now.

Well, it's about goddamn time.

I am done with you.
