Gunter: THAT'S WHAT HE

OH--

RANDALLS QUIT TODAY.

HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO RUN THIS HERD
AROUND HERE BY MYSELF?

YOU AIN'T NO GOOD

YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM.

I CAN BLAME HIM.

I CAN GODDAMN BLAME HIM.

FAMILY, MY ASS.

I GOT A FAMILY TOO.

Will:
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', OLD MAN?!

AND WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

MAKE YOU HAPPY?
I HATE THAT GODDAMN SONG!

YOU OWE ME ONE GUITAR,
YA OLD FOOL!

YOU COULD'VE
PUT OUT AN EYE!

I MEAN, IN ALL
MY BORN DAYS--

YA EVER
SEEN SUCH A THING?

NOW GET YOUR ASSES TO BED!

YOU GO TOO FAR
THIS TIME, TOMMY!

THIS IS TOO MUCH!

GUNTER, BLOW ON THAT.

I WANT YOU
TO GO AHEAD AND DRAW,

BUT DON'T FIRE, OKAY?
DON'T FIRE.

DON'T FIRE.  ALL RIGHT.

WHAT-- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I CALL IT
THE DISTRACTER.

YEAH, IT'S DISTRACTING,
ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.


ALL RIGHT, WHAT WERE
YOU AIMING AT AGAIN?
THE HOLE.

(horse whinnying)

WHO'S THAT?

NO.  THAT WASN'T FORT WORTH.
DAMN SURE WAS.

WE ESCORTED
THAT CATTLE BURSAR BACK--

THAT LITTLE
SQUIRRELLY GUY--

SHIT HIS PANTS
ALL THE WAY HOME.

All: OH!
NO, IT'S KANSAS CITY
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT
AND HEARD THAT NEGRO MUSIC?

BOY, THAT WAS SOMETHING.

YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN OLD TOMMY,

DANCING UP THERE
WITH THEM NEGROES.

THAT WAS A SIGHT
TO BEHOLD.

(footsteps approach)
HEY, IS THIS YOUR BOY?

Tommy:
SON, THIS IS RED.

RED, THAT'S MY BOY, TRAV.

Red:
GOD DAMN.  HAS IT
BEEN THAT LONG?

YOU STILL HOOKED UP
WITH THAT LITTLE OLD GAL

THAT YOU MET
OVER IN SANTA FE?

THAT WAS--
THAT WAS TRAV'S MOM.

SHE TOOK-- TOOK ILL
A FEW YEARS BACK

AND WE LOST HER.

Red:
AW HELL,
THAT'S A SHAME.

I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT, SON.

I DON'T KNOW, RED.
IT'S BEEN TOO DAMN LONG

SINCE I PULLED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS OFF.

I KNOW, I KNOW,
TOMMY, BUT LOOK--

IF WE GET A COUPLE
OF YOUR BOYS TO HELP US OUT,

WE COULD GET
THE DROP ON HIM.

IT'D BE EASY.

BESIDES THAT,
IT'S DIRTY MONEY.

THE LAW AIN'T GONNA
BE LOOKIN' FOR US.

LOOK, I AIN'T NEVER FORGOT
WHAT YOU DONE FOR ME.

MAYBE THIS'LL
MAKE US SQUARE.

RED, WE'RE SQUARE.

TOMMY, I DONE
TALKED TO YOUR BOYS.

I KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE THE PLACE.

THIS MONEY COULD
SAVE THE RANCH.

AND ONE GOOD PAYDAY
FOR THIS OLD BOY--

MAYBE I COULD GET
OUT OF THIS BUSINESS

BEFORE SOME DRUNKEN INDIAN--
RED, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.

YEAH, TOMMY!
IT'S COME LOOSE.

WELL, CAN YOU FIX IT?

I RECKON.
WELL, GOD DAMN FIX IT!

HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO FIX IT BEFORE HE LEFT.

Tommy:
YEAH, HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

TOMMY, WHERE'S THIS
MONEY COME FROM?
WHO'S GOT IT?

WELL, THAT DON'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

IT'S JUST STOLEN MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

SO WE, UH--
WE FIND THIS GUY

AND THEN WHAT?
I DON'T HAVE TO FIND HIM.

RED ALREADY KNOWS
WHERE HE IS.

AND THEN WE KILL HIM?

OH, COME ON!
YOU THINK HE'S JUST
GONNA GIVE IT TO US?

THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

WELL, YOU GOT ANOTHER IDEA,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

WHERE'S MY WHISKEY, GUNTER?

WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T
HAVE TO KILL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

IF HE'S ALL BY HIS-SELF,
WE CAN JUST WALTZ RIGHT IN

AND TAKE IT.

HELL, YOU KNOW HE'LL
JUST GIVE IT TO US.

YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM--
SHARPEST MIND IN TEXAS.

WHERE'S MY WHISKEY?
TOMMY, LISTEN!

LET'S DO IT!

HELL, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL KILL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

AND WE CAN STILL SPLIT
THE MONEY THREE WAYS.

WAY I FIGURE IT,
IT OUGHT TO GET ME
JUST ENOUGH MONEY--

JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ME
ON A SHIP TO JAY-PAN--
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM?!

YOU JUST SUBDUE HIM
AND TAKE THE MONEY!

GUNTER, I COULD DO THAT

AND THEN I'D BE LOOKING
BACK OVER MY SHOULDER

THE REST OF MY DAMN LIFE.
TOMMY, THIS IS A MURDER!

TOMMY!

I AIN'T STUPID.


YOUR GOING TO DO THIS
IN THE SHAPE YOU'RE IN?

DID YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU

IT WAS A LITTLE OLD LADY
HAD THIS MONEY?

CHRIST, GUNTER, WE DON'T
HAVE TO KILL NOBODY.

WE'LL JUST COVER OUR FACES
AND NOBODY'LL KNOW WHO
THE HELL WE ARE.

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG WITH THAT?

YOU ARE REALLY READY
TO START KILLING AGAIN?

IS THIS THE MAN
WHO MARRIES GLORIA?

NO.

GUNTER, WE GOT A LOT
A HISTORY BETWEEN US,

BUT I WON'T ABIDE
NO DISRESPECTFUL
TALK ABOUT GLORIA.

SO JUST DROP IT, OKAY?

JUST DROP IT.

I'M GOING WITH YOU.
THIS AIN'T NONE
OF YOUR AFFAIR.

IT IS.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS.

SOMEONE'S GOT TO KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU.

WELL THANKS, MOM.


BUT I WON'T TAKE PART
IN THE TAKING OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

NO KILLING.
GUNTER, IF I DON'T HAVE
TO KILL NOBODY, I WON'T.

NO KILLING.
PROMISE ME THAT!

ALL RIGHT, DOC.
NO KILLING.

NO KILLING.

OKAY?

OKAY.

(goat bleats)

DAMN IT, DAD,
THIS AIN'T RIGHT.
I SHOULD GO WITH YOU.

TRAVIS, WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT THAT.
I NEED YOU HERE.

WHAT IF YOU
RUN INTO SOME TROUBLE?

I'M GOOD WITH A PISTOL.
WILL'S BEEN TEACHING
ME HOW TO DRAW.  I--

SON!  NO!
END OF DISCUSSION.
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

YOU THINK YOUR MOM
WOULD WANT ME

TO TAKE YOU
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

DAD, I DON'T LIKE IT.

WELL I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER,
BUT THAT'S HOW IT IS.

(horse neighing)

IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

YEAH.
Tommy: YOU GUYS READY?

Gunter:
LET'S GO!

Will:
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A SECOND.

I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN WE GET BACK.

ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS?

OH, NO NO NO NO.
J-- JUST YOUR MAN RIGHT THERE.

I TOLD HIM.

Jake:

WELL, I THOUGHT THERE
MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF REWARD.

"TAKE CARE OF HIM."
I TAKE CARE OF HIM.

SETTLE DOWN.
SLITHERING AROUND OUT THERE
IN YOUR GODDAMN RED SHIRT--

SETTLE DOWN.
--YOU LOOK LIKE
A GODDAMN MOVIN' BARN.

HOW YOU GONNA GET OVER THERE
WITHOUT HIM SEEING YOU?

I AIN'T GOIN'

Gunter: I THOUGHT
THAT WAS THE PLAN.
Tommy: IT WAS THE PLAN.

(horse neighs)

YOU KNOW, ROSE,

MY FATHER WAS THE MEANEST
MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

THERE WAS THIS DAPPLE.

OH, SHE WAS A SIGHT.

I HAD IT IN MY MIND
THAT THE OLD MAN

WAS GONNA GIVE HER TO ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

BUT THEN ONE NIGHT,
THE DAPPLE ESCAPED

FROM THE RIDING STABLES.

AND ALL I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY
WAS A THRASHING.


IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO DREAM, ROSE.

YOU GOTTA STEP UP
AND TAKE WHAT YOU WANT.

WHOA!

THERE WAS A FEW SURPRISES.

THIS BUNCH JUST SHOWED UP
OUT OF THE BLUE.

AND DAVIS?

HE'S DEAD.

THESE BOYS HAD HIM DOWN
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE.

LOCK THEM UP
WITH MY WILDCAT.

I'LL BE OVER DIRECTLY.

Bear:
SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH.

Will:
BEAR, YOU'RE ABOUT
A BIG HEADED SON-OF-A-BITCH.

I BET YOUR MAMA'S ASS HURT
FOR A WEEK WHEN YOU WAS BORN.

BONE UGLY TOO.

Bear:
KNOCK YA UPSIDE
YOUR HEAD, BOY.

FIRST DOOR ON YOUR LEFT.

WELL, HELL, GIVE

Bear: ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

YOU'RE ABOUT

SHE LIED TO ME.

GENTLEMEN.

PICK YOURSELF
A DANCE PARTNER,

YOU'RE GONNA
BE HERE A WHILE.
SO WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

Bear:
SUPPOSED TO WAIT
FOR BIG JAKE.

AFTERNOON, BOYS.

BEAR HERE TELLS ME
THAT YOU HAD A RUN-IN

WITH AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE THIS MORNING.

WE DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT HIM.
HE-- HE WAS FIRING ON US.

OH, I'M NOT SO WORRIED
ABOUT THAT, GENTLEMEN.

FACT IS, YOU DID
BEAR A FAVOR.

WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS...

WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

I WON'T ASK AGAIN--
WE WERE AFTER THE DAMN MONEY.

WE DIDN'T SET OUT
TO KILL HIM.

AND HE HAD THE DROP ON US.

SO YOU WERE AFTER
THE MONEY, HUH?
YEAH.

MY MONEY, OF COURSE?

Gunter:
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT
WAS YOUR MONEY, SIR.

WE DIDN'T KNOW.

WE-- WE THOUGHT IT CAME
FROM A BANK OR SOMETHING.

WE DIDN'T--
Gunter: I SWEAR TO GOD.

MAYBE YOU DID

AND MAYBE YOU DIDN'T.

KILL 'EM.
Gunter: WHAT?

KILL 'EM ALL.
Gunter: KILL US?

Jake:
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH, BEAR?

Gunter:
SIR, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR--
(blow thuds)

(screams)
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO THAT.

YOU DID NOT
HAVE TO DO THAT!

YOU WANT I SHOULD
KILL HER TOO?

WELL, WHY NOT?
TIME FOR A FRESH MOUNT.

(Bear snickering)

NO HARD FEELINGS, VIOLET.

COME FIRST LIGHT...

WE'RE GOING HUNTIN'.

(kicks bars)

Will: THAT IS ONE
MEAN SON OF A BITCH.
(Gunter groaning)

I DON'T THINK
HE'S AMERICAN NEITHER.

HE HITS LIKE ONE.


WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

WHO ARE YOU CLOWNS ANYWAY?

Will: GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY--
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

I'M VIOLET...

TILL TOMORROW, ANYWAY.

THAT BIG GUY--
WITH THE RIFLE--

HE REALLY PLANNING
ON KILLING US?

OH YEAH.
HE SURE HE IS.

THAT MONSTER-- BEAR--

SUGAR, HE'S GONNA MAKE
A SPORT OUT OF THAT.

NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT, HE WON'T.

WELL, YOU DON'T.

SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SHUT THE HELL UP?

I'D LIKE TO HAVE
MY LAST NIGHT OF PEACE HERE.

DAMN, YOU SURE
ARE A LOAD A LAUGHS,
FOR A SPORTING GIRL.

YOU NEED TO TAKE
OFF THAT DRESS IS
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

Violet:
OH PISS OFF, YA HALF-WIT

MOUTH BREATHER.

I LIKE HER ALREADY.

Tommy:
WHY DON'T Y'ALL SHUT UP

AND JUST LET ME
THINK FOR A MINUTE?

WELL, THINK ALL YOU WANT,
OLD TIMER.

'CAUSE IT'S
OVER AT DAWN.


(dog barks)

WHAT, JAKE?

NO!  NO!  NO!

NO!  NO!

JAKE, NO!

Violet:

THE HELL ALONE, JAKE!

(Jake grunts)

DAMN, JAKE!

YOU SHOULD'VE
LEFT ME IN THERE, JAKE.

Jake:
I THINK NOT.

(Violet and Jake laugh)

(rooster crows)


UH, JAKE,
I NEED THE KEYS.

Jake:
I TOLD YOU!

IT'S ON THE GODDAMN BAR!
HEY-- I KNOW.

I-- I CHECKED EVERYWHERE.

I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

DAMN!

Jake:
SO WHAT HAVE YOU
FOULED UP TODAY, BEAR?

I'LL COME BACK
FOR YOU, I PROMISE.

Will:
AIN'T THAT A DAMN PEACH?

THEY SENT HER TO KILL US.
DOES HE EVER SHUT UP?

Tommy:
HE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

Will:
GET YOUR IRONS.  LET'S GO.

Violet:

(gunshot)
HYA!

(horses whinnying)

GET AFTER THEM!
COME ON, LET'S GO!

Violet:
TOMMY!

TAKE A LEFT AT THEM TREES!
Will: TOMMY KNOWS WHAT TO DO!

WE DON'T NEED
TO LISTEN TO YOU!

Gunter:
TOMMY!  SHE'S GOT AN IDEA!

Will:
TOMMY, WHAT ARE WE DOING
LISTENING TO HER?

Violet:
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TOMMY HILL!

WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN? TOMMY!

Bear:
GOD DAMN IT!

HOLD UP HERE
A SECOND, BOYS.

I THINK THEY HEADED UP
TOWARDS THAT DRY CREEK UP THERE.

COME ON, LETS GO!

Will:
I DON'T TRUST HER.

Violet:
I'M RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW?

Will:
YEAH, WELL, I'M RIGHT HERE.
I DON'T TRUST YOU!

WELL, I'M GONNA TRY
REAL HARD NOT TO GET
TOO BROKEN UP ABOUT THAT.

WHERE THE HELL
ARE WE GOIN'?

WE'RE GOING UP
TO THEM TREES.

LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PLACE
TO GET TRAPPED.

Violet:
IT'S OKAY.  I KNOW
THIS MOUNTAIN.

I CAN GET US
OUT OF HERE.

WHY DO YOU
LISTEN TO HER?

HEY, THEY'RE
AFTER ME TOO.

Tommy:
COME ON, BEAR,
YA DUMB BASTARD!

HOLD ON.
YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

Violet:
BEAR!

BEAR!  COME ON, BEAR!

COME ON.

SEE?

YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOIN'?

WELL, I'M GONNA
GO FIND A TRAIL.

THERE'S A TRAIL
TO A LAKE...

RIDGE, I BELIEVE.
Bear: TOMMY HILL!

(guns blasting)

GET BEHIND
THIS ROCK, BOYS.

BEAR, THIS IS SOME
SHIT YOU GOT US INTO.

Bear:
SHUT THE HELL UP, CLARK
OR I'M GONNA TEAR YOU APART

AND PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER--
Clark: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

Bear:
WELL, JUST KEEP SHOOTIN'!
SHOOT SOMETHING!

(guns blasting)

JUST COVER ME, OKAY?

WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

I AIN'T GOT A SHOT!

WELL FOR GOD'S SAKES,
HIT SOMETHING!

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU SEE?

DAMN!

NEVER FELT BETTER, TOMMY!

(Violet howls)

SHIT, THEY LEFT!

(crickets chirping)

THANK YOU FOR WORKING
WITH ME BACK THERE.

I'D SAY THAT
MAKES US ABOUT EVEN.

DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?

Violet:
IT'S A DEAL.

TOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M TRYING
TO GO TO SLEEP.

I CAN SEE THAT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE GROUND?

I'M OKAY HERE.

WELL, IT'S KINDA STUPID

FOR YOU TO SLEEP
ON THE GROUND.

PLENTY OF ROOM
RIGHT HERE.

WELL, JUST ENJOY IT THEN.

OH, DEAR GOD.

YOU THINK YOU
KNOW MY TYPE?

YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, TOMMY.

I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
LIKE IT SOUNDED.

I JUST MEANT WOMEN,
THAT'S ALL.

OKAY.

Will:
TOMMY?

TOMMY?

Tommy: WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT IS IT?

NONE OF Y'ALL MOVE.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

I THINK WE GOT US A SNAKE.

OH, SHIT!

WHAT IS SO
COTTON-PICKIN' FUNNY?

Tommy:
WELL, DID HE BITE YOU?

NOT YET.

HE'S ABOUT
COILED UP ON MY LEG.

MAYBE YOU CAN
JUST JUMP OUT.

YES, AT SOME POINT,

I PLAN ON
JUMPIN' OUT, GUNTER.

WHAT DO WE DO?

UH-OH.
Gunter: WHAT'S WRONG?

I GOT A STIRRIN' DOWN BELOW.
JUST HOLD ON--

THIS IS WHAT COMES
FROM A MAN WHO EATS
NOTHING BUT BEANS, TOMMY.

(rattling)
Tommy: DON'T DO THAT!

UH-OH.

(passes gas)
(screams)

GOD DAMN IT TO HELL!

GOD!  SON OF A GOOD GOD!
(hissing, rattling)

DAMN!  HOLY JEHOSOPHAT!

HE BIT ME!
GOD DAMN!  TOMMY!

GOD!
Tommy: HOW IS HE?

WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
TO REAL DOCTOR.

Violet:
YOU AIN'T NO REAL DOCTOR?

IT'S A NICKNAME.

BITE ON THIS.

THE CLOSEST TOWN'S
SAN ANTON'.

WILL, THAT'S
A TWO-DAY RIDE.

Will:
I CAN MAKE IT.

OW!  GOD, DOC!

Tommy:
WE KNOW FOR SURE
THAT BEAR AND HIS GUYS

ARE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
I SAID I CAN MAKE IT.


DOC!

(Will slurring)
'CAUSE THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU GOT--


I'M GONNA CATCH THAT--
GOTTA GO TO JAY-PAN.

(fire crackling)
(coughing)

(horses whinny)
(Will grunts)

(Will screaming)
Gunter: I'M SORRY, WILL.

I'M SORRY.
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD, TOMMY.

Tommy: I'M SURE YOU DON'T.
TOMMY, I'M SORRY I--

Tommy: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO GO.

Gunter: LIE DOWN.
(coughing)

(all chatting)

(Will screams)



WELL, I SURE
COULD USE A WHISKEY.

Gunter:
YEAH.

SO WHAT'S HIS STORY--

TOMMY?  AN OUTLAW OR WHAT?

WELL,

THAT IS A HARD QUESTION.

HE IS... ALL THAT.

UH--

I HAVE KNOWN TOMMY
SINCE I WAS A YOUNG MAN.

HE USED TO RIDE
WITH A GANG THAT, UH--

WELL, THEY KILLED MY FAMILY.

AND THEY LEFT
TOMMY BEHIND TO MOP UP.

I WAS STILL ALIVE
WHEN TOMMY FOUND ME.

HE POINTED HIS GUN
STRAIGHT AT ME

IN ORDER TO FINISH ME OFF.

AND I WANTED HIM TO DO IT.

MY FAMILY WAS NEW
TO AMERICA AND...

NOW THEY WERE DEAD
AND I WAS ALONE

IN THIS HARSH LAND.

DAMN.

WHAT HAPPENED?

HE COULDN'T DO IT.

HE TOLD ME YEARS LATER

THAT, UH--

SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THAT MOMENT

AND, UH, HE COULDN'T DO IT.


SO HE LET YOU GO.

HE TOOK ME IN,

TOOK CARE OF MY WOUNDS,

GAVE ME A PLACE
TO WORK AND LIVE.

I'VE BEEN WITH HIM
EVER SINCE.

HE'S A GOOD MAN--

AT LEAST HE TRIES TO BE.

(bell ringing)
GUNTER, YOU TAKE
THAT BELL TOWER.

JUST KEEP A GOOD WATCH.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO.

I'LL BE OVER
TAKIN' CARE OF WILL.

ALL RIGHT.
WELL, BEAR AND HIS BOYS,

THEY'LL BE HERE BY TOMORROW.

THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

I HOPE THEY ARE.

I'M READY TO GET
THIS OVER WITH.



Will:
YOU REAL PRETTY.
YOU GOT PRETTY EYES.

THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

MY NAME IS WILL--

WILLIAM DAVID THOREAU.

I WRITE BOOKS, MOSTLY.
WHAT ABOUT?

OH, I WRITE ABOUT

TREES AND FROGS AND--

YOU KNOW-- LIFE,

PONDS AND SHIT LIKE THAT.

YOU EVER HEARD OF ME?
YEAH.

I'M GONNA TAKE ME
A SHIP TO JAY-PAN.

WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?
YOU WANNA COME WITH ME?

YEAH, SURE YOU ARE.

AIN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF ME?

YEAH.

Y'ALL DON'T NEED
ANY PENCILS, DO YA?


TOMMY, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WAS WITH A WOMAN?

NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
(laughs)

IF YOU ASK ME,
I REALLY BELIEVE--
I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT ALL YOUR DRINKING

AND YOUR RAGING
AND ALL YOUR CARRYING-ON--

IT'S A SURE SIGN
OF A MAN WITHOUT A WOMAN.

I THINK YOU'RE LONELY,
TOMMY HILL.


YOU'RE WORSE THAN GUNTER.

IF YOU SURVIVE
JAKE AND BEAR...

MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO THINK
ABOUT SETTLING DOWN AGAIN,

MAKE ANOTHER GO OF IT.

WELL, I VERY SELDOM TAKE
ADVICE FROM SPORTIN' GALS.

TO HELL WITH YOU,
TOMMY HILL.

HELL, YOU'RE
SO OLD AND DAMN GIMPY,

YOU COULDN'T EVEN
FALL DOWN WITHOUT HELP.


LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, TOMMY.

JAKE'S LIKELY
TO PULL YOUR SKIN OFF

FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

AND BEAR--

HONEY, YOU DON'T KNOW BEAR.

THAT MAN LIVES
FOR SLOW KILLINGS.

WELL, BRING 'EM ON.
I'M TIRED OF WAITING.

DON'T BE STUPID, TOMMY.

PLEASE DON'T BE STUPID.

YOU KNOW,
MISS KATHERINE,

ME AND TOMMY,
WE GOT A SPREAD

JUST EAST A HERE
THAT MAKES THIS PLACE

LOOK LIKE CACTUS GROWING
OUT OF A HORSE TURD.

Bear:
TOMMY!

TOMMY HILL!

CAN YOU HEAR ME, BOY?!

TOMMY HILL!

YOU'RE SCARED SHITLESS!

TOMMY!


(birds squawking)

Tommy:
BEAR!

(guns blasting)




I SHOT YOUR BOY, TOMMY.

Clark: BEAR!
(guns blasting)


Violet:
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, TOMMY?
WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

Tommy:
TRAVIS!

Will:
MY FOOT HURTS!

Man:
TOMMY!  TOMMY!

TOMMY!

Tommy:
WHERE'S TRAVIS, BUZZARD?

Buzzard:
HE'S ALL RIGHT.  I GOT HIM
IN THE OLD SANCHEZ PLACE,

DOWN IN THE CANYON.

HE TOOK TWO BULLETS.

THEM BASTARDS CAME IN
SHOOTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVED,

THREE OF 'EM--
ONE BIGGUN.

THE LUCKY THING IS,
TRAVIS PASSED OUT

AND THEY TOOK HIM
FOR DEAD.

HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
YEAH, HE JUST
NEEDS SOME REST.

WHAT THE HELL
Y'ALL GOT INTO?

BIG JAKE AND BEAR
DID THIS.

AND THEY DAMN SURE
KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT TOO.

LOOKING OVER
OUR SHOULDERS--

WE GOING AFTER
THIS BIG JAKE? HUH?

NO, TOMMY,
THAT'S SUICIDE.

I'M GOING WITH YOU.
I'M GOING TOO.

WE COME ALL THIS WAY.

DAD...

I'M SORRY.

IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.


WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, VIOLET?

VIOLET?

WHAT, TOMMY?

YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET

INVOLVED WITH
A WOMAN AGAIN.
YEAH, I KNOW.

YOU ALREADY
TOLD ME ALL THIS.
WAIT A MINUTE.

LET ME FINISH.

I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER.

I DRINK A LOT
AND I AIN'T GOT NO HOME.

YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO SELL YOURSELF.

I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYIN' TO SAY IS

I WOULDN'T MIND
RUNNING INTO YOU AGAIN.

THAT'S QUITE AN OFFER.

THAT'S QUITE
AN INVITATION.

WELL, I WAS--
I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE--

MAYBE WE COULD MEET
IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING.

WE'LL SEE, TOMMY.

WE'LL SEE.

ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE.


MA'AM.  JAKE WANTED
ME TO LET HIM KNOW
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED.

CODY SAID
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

Jake:
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

LOOKS LIKE THEY DONE
WORKED 'EM OVER PRETTY GOOD.

YOU AND THE MEN,
KEEP LOOKING.

I WANT THOSE
SONS OF BITCHES DEAD.

YEP.

WELL, SHOOT.

THANKS FOR PATCHIN' ME
UP AND ALL.

AND GOOD LUCK TO YA
IN ANY AND ALL

FUTURE PROSPECTS.

IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

YOU SLOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, WILLIAM.

ALL RIGHT, THEN.
OKAY.

I KNOW I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.

YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

I WILL.

I SURE WILL.

WELL, BYE, Y'ALL.

Y'ALL TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELVES.

Gunter:
BE SAFE.

YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.

WELL, I AIN'T DRINKIN'
TILL THIS IS OVER WITH.

YOU'LL BE FINE
AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS.

TRY IT AGAIN.

Violet:
HEY, BILLY!

(smacks)
YOU GODDAMN BITCH!

LET GO OF ME!
LET GO OF MY ARMS, JAKE!

BITCH!
LET GO OF ME, JAKE!

LET GO OF ME!

(both sigh)

SHE COULD BE YOUR
GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER, JAKE.

YOU CAME BACK
FOR A CATFIGHT!


TIRED OF YOUR
NEW BOYFRIENDS, ARE YOU?

THEY'RE SMALL-TIMERS, JAKE.

THEN WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

I DON'T KNOW.
I LEFT 'EM BACK IN DEACON.

BEAR'S GOT 'EM
SO GODDANG SPOOKED,

THEY JUST RIDIN'
AROUND IN CIRCLES

TRYING TO LOSE
THEIR OWN SHADOWS.

I GUESS NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE
GUNNIN' FOR THE BOTH OF US.

YA THINK?



JAKE!
OH! (chuckling)

WHEN YOU GONNA
GET A NEW BED?

I HATE THIS BED.
MM.

(pulse beating)

MORNING, SWEETIE.

(growls)
(laughs)

I'LL GET THEM
BISCUITS OUT DIRECTLY.

Jake:
YEAH, I WANT
SOME BISCUITS.

ROSE, GO UP TO YOUR
ROOM AND GET DRESSED.

(crowd chattering)

(glasses clanging)

THANK YOU.

LOOK, JAKE,
I KNOW I FUCKED UP.

BUT THAT'S
WHY I'M HERE NOW.

SUGAR, I GOT SOMETHING
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

LET'S HEAR IT.

THEY GOT A HELL
OF A GANG, JAKE.

THERE'S AT LEAST 15 MEN--
HOW GOOD ARE HIS HIRED GUNS?

I DON'T KNOW.

GO ON.

WELL, THEY'RE
GUNNIN' FOR YOU, JAKE.

I MEAN, THEY'RE
GONNA RUN IN HERE

AND GUN DOWN
EVERYBODY THEY FIND.

NO SURPRISES,
NO AMBUSHES--

AN UNBELIEVABLY
STUPID GESTURE.

(laughs)
YEAH.

WELL, BEAR,
OR WHOEVER IT WAS

YOU SENT DOWN THERE
TO LIGHT THAT PLACE UP--

SUGAR, THEY SHOT HIS KID.

WELL, THEY'RE ALREADY
ON THEIR WAY.

THEY GONNA TAKE
ALL THE BACK TRAILS, JAKE.

THEY GONNA MAKE SURE
THEY AIN'T SEEN.

THEY'RE GONNA BE
AT THE OLD CROSSING...

TWO NIGHTS FROM NOW.

(slams glass)

WELL DONE, GIRL.

THANK YOU, JAKE.

JAKE...

I PROMISE YOU
WON'T GET NO MORE

TROUBLE OUT OF ME.

BUT THEY DAMN SURE
BETTER BE WHERE YOU SAY.

BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LYING,

I'LL TEAR YOU TO PIECES
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

YEAH.

YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A DAY
BEFORE THEY REACH THE RIVER,

SO YOU'LL
HAVE TO MAKE GOOD TIME.

A GOLD PIECE

TO THE MAN THAT KILLS
THIS TOMMY HILL.

YOU BOYS
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.

(rooster crows)


(loud blast)

(thunder rumbling)

(crickets chirping)

(gun clicks)

GET UP.

GET UP AND GET ME
SOME COFFEE!

Jake:
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

YOU!

YOU ARE ONE DEAD
SON OF A BITCH.

I'D BE WORRYIN' ABOUT MYSELF
RIGHT NOW IF I WAS YOU.

VIOLET!


Tommy:
GET DOWN HERE, JAKE!

NOW... I GOT A LOT
OF MONEY HERE.

A LOT MORE THAN
YOU GENTLEMEN NEED.

GET OVER HERE, DAMN IT.

OH, SURE, I'M UNARMED.

PUT A BULLET IN MY FACE.

OH, I COULD SHOOT
YOU IN THE BACK,

LIKE YOUR GUYS
DID MY BOY!

AND THE MOMENT
MY MEN HEAR THAT SHOT,

THEY'LL BE IN HERE.
(gun clicks)

Violet:
TOMMY, JUST STOP
FOR A MINUTE.

YOU KNOW, JAKE,
I'M REALLY GONNA ENJOY THIS.

TOMMY, DON'T.

TURN HIM IN.

NOT A CHANCE, GUNTER.

YOU CAN'T DO THIS,
NOT THIS WAY.

GUNTER, AMIGO,

NO MORE PREACHIN',
ALL RIGHT?

NOT THIS TIME.
THINK ABOUT IT, TOMMY.

IF YOU SHOOT HIM IN COLD BLOOD,
YOU'RE AS BAD AS HE IS.

THEY SHOT TRAVIS, GUNTER.
I KNOW, TOMMY, I KNOW.

TURN HIM IN AND LET
THE LAW DEAL WITH HIM.

WE NEED TO BLOW THIS
LIMEY'S BRAINS OUT.

PRONTO.
TOMMY, THIS IS A TEST.

FOR TRAVIS'S SAKE,
FOR MY SAKE, FOR GLORIA

AND FOR THE SAKE
OF ANY PEACE YOU MIGHT HAVE

IN YOUR LAST YEARS,
PLEASE, STOP THE KILLING.



(pulse beating)


(gun clicks)

MOVE!

Tommy:
GET HER UPSTAIRS!

Gunter:
TOMMY!  GUNS!

(guns blasting)
(grunts)

(thuds)
THAT'S FOR MARYELLA.

GREAT PLAN, TOMMY.

WELCOME TO TEXAS--
LOTS OF GUNS.

(guns blasting)


BABY, STAY DOWN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

HEY!  Y'ALL HOLD ON!!


HOW ABOUT THAT GERMAN
PACIFIST THERE, HUH?

GUNTER!  GET 'EM, BUD!

(man screams)

Will:
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.
AIN'T YOU SOMETHING?

SHOOT, THAT
WAS ONE BIG GANG.

TOMMY, WATCH YOUR BACK!
THERE'S TWO COMIN'!
(men yelling)

(guns blasting)
TOMMY HILL!

WHY DON'T YOU DIE?!

(grunts, thuds)

WHOO!

(cheering, laughing)

Violet:
WE DID IT, BOYS!

HELLFIRE, WE DID IT!

DAMN SURE DID!

Will:
WHAT YOU GONNA DO
WITH YOUR MONEY?

YOU GONNA
REBUILD THAT RANCH?

I DON'T KNOW.
I TELL YOU WHAT,

I'M GONNA GET ME OUT
OF THIS GODFORSAKEN COUNTRY.

I'M GONNA TAKE ME
A BOAT STRAIGHT TO--

JAY-PAN!

(all laughing)

JESUS!


SHIT, IT'S COLD.

WILL
WHAT IS IT?

WILL!
DAMN, TOMMY.

WHAT IS IT, WILL?

Will: TOMMY?
Gunter: OH MY GOD.

Will:
HOW BAD IS IT?

OH MY GOD.

(Gunter sighs)

HOW BAD IS IT?
Gunter: OH MY GOD.

IT'S REALLY BAD, WILL.
Gunter: IT'S BAD, WILL.

I SHOULD'VE LET YOU
STAY UP FRONT THERE.

(laughs, cries)
Tommy: YOU SURE SHOULD'VE.

(laughing, gagging)

TAKE IT EASY, WILL.
I'M GONNA CATCH ME
THAT SHIP TO JAY-PAN.

YOU BET.  YOU BET!

Will:
Y'ALL GOT TO GO
AHEAD AND GO THOUGH.

Tommy:
WE AIN'T LEAVING YOU.

Y'ALL GOT TO GO.
Gunter: WE'RE STAYIN', WILL.


Will:
Y'ALL CAN'T
GO WHERE I'M GOING.

WE AIN'T LEAVIN'.

COULD YOU GET US A COUPLE
OF GUITARS AND DO US A SONG?

Gunter: OKAY.
WILL, BUDDY,

WE'RE OUT OF GUITARS.

NOW, AIN'T THAT
SUNSET SOMETHING?

AH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET.

Will: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Violet: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

(Tommy murmurs)
WILL!

WILL!

WILL!

HE'S DEAD.

YEAH.

NO.

GOOD--

GOODBYE, WILL.

MY BROTHER.

I'M GONNA
MISS HIM, TOMMY.

Tommy:
I KNOW YOU ARE.

I'M GONNA MISS
HIM TOO, GUNTER.

LET'S GO HOME.

OKAY.
