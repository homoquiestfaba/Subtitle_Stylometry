Power resides where
men believe it resides.

I will hurt you for this.

The day will come when you
think you're safe and happy...

and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

It's about power.

This world has gotten very dangerous.

No one is safe.

Killing you would send
your brother a message...

Grenade!

It's massive.

We will take back what
was stolen from me!

It takes you by surprise.

You win or you die.

It's war.

I think from the first
time Dan and I read

George Martin's books we knew
he had taken fantasy to a

different place that
never'd been before,

into a more realistic place...

The characters don't feel like
they're in... they're locked

in the eternal struggle
of good and evil.

They feel like real people wrapped into
live in a world that's not our world,

the world where magic still exists.

It's a much more adult, grounded
and psychologically complex,

it probably has more in common
with many other HBO shows

than The Sopranos and Deadwood.

I think it's more reality-based
than fantasy, personally.

And maybe I'm a little bit biased
'cause I sometimes see, uh...

people of my size, how they are
represented in fantasies,

they're comical and...
I feel like there's some sort of

cook-book that they
have to follow in fantasy.

With our show, that line
is very unclear.

It would be good to
have you in the field.

Competition has become a little stale.

I don't fight in tournaments.

But that's why when I fight
a man for real

I don't want them to
know what I can do.

My character is a Lannister.
And the Lannister family

is the most powerful, the
strongest family in all the kingdoms.

They come from amazing privilege.

It's sort of "mess them up a little bit"
in terms of how they should be treated.

Starks are enemies.

Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

Starks are one of the oldest families
in Westeros and they have a

very strong code. They take a lot
of proud in being Northerners.

South is the place you'd really rather live.
It's Southern California opposed to Alaska

and for the Starks their
motto is "Winter Is Coming".

Metaphorical in the sense that things
are always gonna get worse.

A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

They've maintained power in
the North for thousands of years

and they really have the respect
of the people they lead,

and part of that means if someone
needs to be executed for instance,

you don't have an executioner do it,

you do it yourself because
that's the Stark way.

Don't look away.

You did well.

Jon is not exactly a Stark.
He is a Snow, he's called a bastard name.

But he is of the North and his father
is Ned Stark so he's half a Stark.

Bastards get the names derived
on where they are from.

So if you a Northern bastard,
you're a Snow.

If you're born in The Riverlands
and you're a bastard

you're a Rivers
and so forth and so on.

On one side you have the
not-trained maternal family

that you see in a lot of the family
characters but at the same time

the politics of being royal as well,

it's kind of really, really fascinating.

Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea

and take back your father's throne.

The people drink secret
toast to your health.

They cry out for their true king.

She's an exiled princess
on the run because

her father was used out
from the throne.

As she is with her older
brother, Viserys,

and he is fearlessly ambitious and he's
been planning his return to be king.

Vengeance is obviously
another driving motivation.

This is a ruthless world,
this is a world where people

are constantly killing each other
and often they do so to avenge a

prior crime and of course
the cycle of avenge is

you kill somebody that just means
that now you are the target for

the next person in the avenge cycle so

vengeance drives a number
of different narrowed threats.

In my dreams I kill him every night.

Robert Baratheon came
to power as a warrior.

This is someone who won
the throne through violence

and the attempted rebellions will be
dealt with the show of real force.

He has two brothers, one is Renly
Baratheon who is the younger brother,

he's never fought in anything. His other
brother Stannis on the other hand,

Stannis is a proving commander,
problem with Stannis is nobody likes him.

Stannis is your older brother.
We both know what Stannis is.

He inspires no love or loyalty.

Very well written characters,
it's the core of the show.

Everyone can relate to someone.

Who but you can protect the kingdom?

It covers all bases, I think that's why
people get so passionate about it.

They can loose themselves in
these characters and in their stories.

Some people hold a grudge,
some people don't.

I'll try to keep you
alive for her sake.

The tension is always so high,

and then you can decide for
yourself as an audience member

who you believe should have the power.

The first book was written 20
years ago and there's still so much

that seems to apply to
what's going on today.

When you are writing about
people struggling for power,

that's so much of
what drives the world.

When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

It's been interesting
working on the first season

and seeing the response to it
and seeing people try to apply

things that they saw on
Game Of Thrones to real world events.

You have the same power corrupts and
I think that's very true.

There was a raven from King's Landing.

Jon Arryn is dead.

The King's most important
adviser is called The Hand of the King

and the former Hand has died
under mysterious circumstances,

so King Robert travels north
to ask his most trusted friend

to come back to the capital with him

and serve as his chief
adviser, as his Hand.

Lord Eddard Stark,
I will name you the Hand of the king.

One of the primary conflicts in the
show is when Ned is called south

and given no choice, to help out his
best and oldest friend in the world.

They were raised together,
they learnt how to fight together,

Robert just looks on Ned
as a true brother.

I mean, Robert has two brothers
that he doesn't like or trust.

But there's no one else out there
that Robert could give

that much faith and confidence in,
it had to be Ned Stark.

We were meant to rule together.

Ned doesn't want to do it.
He hates politics, doesn't want

any part of that, he's a guy who's
spent most of his life fighting in wars

and now he really wants to spend
the rest of his life with his family

in relative quiet.

I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats nest they call a capital.

His wife reminds him the last
Hand might have been murdered

and he's putting himself into a
very dangerous situation.

He ends up going south with
his two daughters and

nothing is ever the same after that.

Ned is a very good man,
he's the one we're rooting for

and that's because he is noble,
he believes in doing the right thing.

There's grace on a serving
in the Night's Watch.

The Starks have manned the
wolves for thousands of years.

You may not have my name,
but you have my blood.

The Night's Watch is a band of men,
who have been guarding the south

from what lies beyond
the wall for millennia

and what lies beyond the wall in this
day and age is thought to be wildings,

and probably not a huge thread,

but we know there to be
other things that may be rising.

I am ready to swear your oath.

Do you understand what
you'd be giving up?

The vow for the Night's Watch is
you forsake having children,

you forsake having a wife, you forsake
anything that was from your old life.

You give your life to
protecting the realms.

Welcome.

And Tyrion says to Jon that he's an
outsider as well, they're both outsiders,

and you have to arm yourself with what

your code'd be, a bastard
or dwarf or little man,

and then it can never
be used to hurt you.

Why do you read so much?

My brother has a sword
and I have my mind,

and a mind needs books like
a sword needs a whetstone.

Tyrion is someone who's always
had an affinity for other outcasts,

he'd grow up a dwarf in a society
where if you were born a peasant,

and you're a dwarf, your father would
have carried you out into wilderness

and left you there for the wolves.

Luckily he was born into
a very wealthy family.

This is about family and
what family means and

how loyalties and how love
for those around you

can make them do things which they
wouldn't necessarily do otherwise.

You're not thinking
of taking the black.

What? And go celibate?

Cersei just wants him dead,
she loathes Tyrion.

Wouldn't get underneath
her skins, very easily,

because we know each other's secrets
and know each other's desires

and know how to exploit
that into our advantage.

He's not afraid of his sister.

Almost everyone in the
kingdom is afraid of Cersei,

but Tyrion is not and he's known about
her affair with Jamie for a very long time.

He fell in love with the
wrong woman in so many ways,

in this case he fell in
love with his sister.

Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for
300 years to keep the blood line's pure.

Dany has only known what
her brother has told her.

She is incredibly submissive and she is
completely dominated by her older brother.

She's a princess but she's also
her brother's pawn in being sold

into marriage to someone she
perceives as a terrifying barbarian

from an alien culture.

You see how long his hair is?

When Dothraki are defeated in
combat, they cut off their braids

so the whole world
can see their shame.

Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

She's been married off to Khal Drogo,
a horse lord of the Dothraki,

and this marriage is purely for
Viserys political convenience,

he wants to go back home
and conquer Westeros.

The problem is he
doesn't have an army.

And the easiest way for
him to get an army

is to get one by marrying off his
sister to a Dothraki horse lord,

who has a horde of
40,000 tough fighters.

So the deal that Viserys thinks
he strikes is

"You get to marry my sister and then you'll
come with me and we'll fight my enemies

and conquer Westeros."

The wedding day is not how you'd hope

your wedding day would go.

A Dothraki wedding wedding
without three deaths

is considered a dull affair.

He's an incredibly aggressive warrior.

And he doesn't speak her language.

So first and foremost,
there's a language barrier there.

This is her new society and
she's initially repelled by that.

But as she starts to travel with them
and ride with them

and spend more time with them,
she actually comes to actually admire them,

and have a great deal of respect
for their culture.

It kinda turns from being a horrific
arranged violent marriage to

a beautiful love story and they're kind of
perfect for each other,

So it turns into something quite gorgeous.

You're not supposed to be here.

No!

They come into our home
and try to murder my brother...

Do you know whose dagger this is?

I do. Tyrion Lannister, the Imp.

The strongest characters
in the story are female

and I like to think of
the dual between the two mothers

in the competing families, Catelyn Stark
and Cersei Lannister.

They seem diametrically opposed
in many other ways, but

they're both women that are driven

to very extreme actions

to protect their children.

This man came into my house

and there conspired to murder my son.

I call upon you to seize him.

The wonderful thing for me is that
it's got some strong women in it,

which is wonderful
as a young girl to be playing

such a strong female role.

I've heard the show
be referred to as feminist.

We have characters
such as Cersei the Queen,

Daenerys, the exiled princess,
who find their strength

through being wronged.

And then some of
the possibly strongest characters

and the most brutal in a lot of ways.

The next time

you raise a hand to me,

will be the last time you have hands.

This is the first time
that she starts to take matters

into her own hands and she starts
to kinda see who she could become.

She sees something in Khal Drogo

that gives her the courage
to make the best of this situation.

A Targaryen of the head of a Dothraki army!

The Narrow Sea lies between us.

Ned is a very straightforward person

and finds himself dealing
with backstabbers and double-dealers.

No matter how effective
he is at being Ned Stark

he's really not very well
equipped to handle them.

We've come to a dangerous place.

We must protect ourselves.

Look after one another.

Ultimately, those qualities
that we consider positive qualities

become liabilities for him.

I'm looking for my brother.
You kill me,

your brother is a dead man.

He loves Tyrion.

And I think that it's mutual.

They're both Lannisters and they like
to play with people's ideas of them.

Have you ever heard the phrase

"Rich as a Lannister"?

Of course you have,

You're a smart man.

I was falsely accused of attempted murder.

They kept me
at the Eyrie, in a sky cell and

and the fourth wall of the cell
is basically a cliff...

The show is often about the misuse
and abuse of power

and what happens when people end up with

a power that they're not really fit
to wield and what can go wrong...

Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son.

Robert Baratheon dies and
his young unfit son sits on the throne.

Bring me his head.
No!

You hear this kind of whispers
as you start to make the show

"Are you really gonna kill
your lead in the first season?"

And we were nervous about that scene
and also couldn't be more excited

because it's really the emotional
climax of the season.

Ned's death becomes the occasion

for the struggle to return
freedom to the North.

That's only the tip of the iceberg.

Jon has a huge dilemma

when he hears what's going on south of the
wall, that his brother is rallying to the war.

You took the oath, you can't leave.

He didn't expect his family
to be wronged in such a way.

I think it takes huge courage
for him to forsake them really

and to stick with what his task is.

It's a big decision and that creates
who he is going to be in season 2.

The world becomes
a much more dangerous place.

An open war started to break out
between Robb and the South.

They're all in danger, always.

The world is gotten darker,
is gotten more violent.

None of our characters are
in safe places anymore.

It certainly makes the actors
read their scripts quicker,

knowing that anyone could die at any point.

It just keeps you guessing
and it keeps you on your toes.

You never know which family
you're gonna be rooting for.

There's such a wide variety
of fans out there.

It doesn't just appeal, I think,
to one demographic.

What I always wanted is
for the show to not disappoint them.

And Dany is such a character that people

either love or hate,
but it's always been positive.

Luckily, I had no one who said
"You were rubbish", which is always good.

Everyone's just being wonderful.

The final image seems to be the one
that people kind of speak about most.

People go, "Yeah, I saw that."

I had to guy buy all the books.

It's cool. It's amazing.

I remember having a conversation
with an HBO executive and saying

"You know, this isn't the kind of show
that gets nominated for fans cause

they don't like fantasy shows, ***
just doesn't happen."

And Dan, my partner said,
"We just got nominated

for an Emmy" and it was just...
it was pretty surreal and it was great

to see Peter get nominated and so many other
people that worked so hard on the show.

I remember exactly when
they called out Peter's name.

I was definitely shout out, I was so happy

for him, I was so happy for the show.

The Golden Globes
is a slightly different event,

because there's wine and
champagne on the table, but...

when he won, that was also
an amazing experience for everybody.

I mean recognition is really great.

You pretend to be cynical about it,
but it's great

when something that you love
and respect and love being a part of

turns into a hit or popular.

Um, it's a really great feeling.

To have that recognized,

so early on, it's glorious,
it's incredible.

The world just got a lot bigger.

By season 2, we're already at war.

So there's no more peace.
Basically, everywhere you go,

this world got very very dangerous.
There are more characters and

things just got a lot more brutal.

We do have a clash of kings,
of several kings and

we have a lot of people
who believe they are the rightful king.

Many of the characters that were together

and in one another's presence
in season 1 have been

dispersed to the four winds in season 2

who is definitely bigger in *** field.

The locations we *** were
so stunning that

they kinda look CGIs.

We went there to not CGI things and

I think that makes the show what it is.

Everything's done in a very real way.

The ability to go to places like
Malta or Croatia or Iceland to shoot

affords us an opportunity to hit
the kind of a realistic note that

is never possible no matter how brilliant
the sets are.

That affects the actors too.
It puts us there.

When you're in a cave up
in the mountains and you're there and

you see your own breath,
you don't have to CGI breath.

You're cold, so you don't have to act cold.

So it does a lot of the work for you.

We've been able to do it
the way we want to.

We've been able to go to all these far
found locations with an incredible cast.

I mean, the books have such
a huge ensemble of characters.

And so many of those roles
are really vital.

It's not like if it is a one-man show
with a bunch of side characters.

There are really 20 characters in the show

who all are often the leaders
in their particular scenes.

We've got some new characters,
who are fascinating and wonderful

and bring new dimensions and textures and

and bring out new things in the characters
that we already know and love.

And again more brilliant women, more
brilliant, strong, feisty, wonderful women

who just gonna dominate.

The time to strike is now.

The Stark fight the Lannisters,
Baratheons fight each other.

All of our characters are increasingly
dangerous circumstances

and even the characters that
you might think of as villains

in their minds, they are actually
doing the right thing.

It's not all black and white with Jaime.

He's got the twists and surprises.

Do you think that you can't beat dragons,

but actually the reality of that is that

they are stuck in a wasteland,

and whilst having dragons is kind of
the biggest miracle this world has seen,

it's not gonna put a roof
over their heads or food on the table.

And so that's kind of the first struggle
that you see they're doing.

What you can expect from
this season is more bloodshed,

there's more epic sword fighting,

It doesn't hold back any punches.

You're gonna be left on a knife
edge again and again.

Not to give too much away,
but the fans who want

blood and battle won't be
disappointed in season 2.

The cold winds are rising.

The war of five kings,
they're calling it.

Nothing matters but how it ends.

I heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

That comet means one thing, boy.
Dragons.

Power is a curious thing.

It's a trick,

a shadow on the wall.

This is what ruling is.

Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out
before they strangle you in your sleep.

The king's a lost cause.

It's the rest of us I am
worried about now.

You have inherited your father's
responsabilities.

They come at a cost.
I love her.

I saw it.
Whatever it was, you'll see it again.

When my dragons are grown,
we will burn cities to the ground.
