You know the five sweetest words
in the English language? No, sir.

Frank luchino,
you're under arrest.

We have visual confirmation.
Okay, here we go.

Come on, come on!

It's crunch time.
Let's go! Come on!

<i>I want you upstairs,</i>
<i>downstairs, everywhere.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Come on, get a move on.</i>

<i>Okay, bird one,</i>
<i>verify subject on board.</i>

This is the FBI.
All personnel on deck.

<i>We have positive I.D.</i>
<i>Luchino is alone.</i>

Yes! Come to daddy, sweetheart.

<i>Roger, bird one.</i>
<i>Go to position two.</i>

Roger. Securing marina now.

Oh, n... oh, no!

Hey, I'm sorry
I'm a few bucks short.

Baby, didn't I tell you to bring
all my bread 'round to my crib?

<i>Miles! Miles, Miles, Miles.</i>

There's no reality here.

I just don't feel...

<i>That you're being truthful</i>
<i>with your performance.</i>

Could you explain
what didn't work?

It's just that...
You're not black enough.

<i>You need to be more</i>
<i>afro-American.</i>

More Harlem-esque.

Harlem-esque? <i>Miles,</i>

feel your roots!

Get down with your bad self.

I'd love to get down with
my bad self, Mr. Grunfeld,

but black people don't talk
like that anymore.

We definitely don't dress
like this!

I look like
"superfly goes hiking."

Never... argue
with the playwright.

<i>Once more and from the top.</i>

And this time...

Funkier!

Yo, baby. I'm sorry
I'm a few bucks short.

Didn't I tell you to come by
my<i> crib</i> wit' my<i> bread?</i>

I oughta pop you
upside the head.

That's it! That's how
it was meant to be played.

<i>Oh, Miles... This is acting.</i>

See you next week, Miles.
Take care, honey.

See you guys. Bye.

<i>Â¶ All my life I've been told</i>
<i>what I can and cannot do Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ but the world is turning</i>
<i>I've got some news for you Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ let my yes's be my yes's</i>
<i>my no's be my no's Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ through with straddling fences</i>
<i>gonna carry my own load Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ it's so simple</i>
<i>why can't they see Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I'm no better than you</i>
<i>you're no better than me Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ ain't gonna walk that line</i>
<i>no compromise Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I've seen the truth and</i>
<i>I've got nothing to lose Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ ain't gonna walk that line</i>
<i>no compromise Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I've seen the truth and</i>
<i>the truth has cut me loose Â¶Â¶</i>

<i>- bravo!</i>
<i>- Marvelous!</i>

Miles! What's going on?

How you doin'? All right.
How you doin'?

I'm all right.

Miles, how you doin', good-looking?
Baby.

Nice hat. Thanks.

Yo, Duane. Duane!

Yo-yo-yo-yo, Duane!

Quit shoutin'. Duane's busy.

I guess he is.
You must be susie.

Who the hell is susie?
My name is Ruth!

That's what I meant, Ruth.

Duane spriggs, get your
skinny butt out here.

Who the hell is susie?

<i>Hey, hey?</i>

Keep it down.
I'm trying to watch Oprah.

Martha, you look like you've been
gettin' too much beauty sleep.

Don't you try to
sweet-talk me, Miles pope.

If you don't stop that noise,

I'm gonna put you to sleep
and it won't be beautiful.

Mmm-mmm!

Duane!

Wait!

Wait a minute. She meant nothing to me.
I don't care, Duane.

She meant less than nothing.
I don't care! It's over.

<i>Excuse me, can I get by?</i>

If that was Ruth,

who the hell...
what happened to susie?

Susie walked out on me...
When you called her Kate.

<i>Remember?</i> Oh, yeah.

What have you got against my love life?
You always do this shit.

It's hard. It would take
an Einstein to keep up.

You ruined my afternoon. Did you see that woman?
She was gorgeous, man!

She was a giant,
is what she was, man.

You're sheep!

<i>You and all the guys</i>
<i>who think like you.</i>

You like these skinny women
with no curves.

<i>Me, on the other hand,</i>

I'm like rubens, like titian...

<i>Jesus, Duane,</i>
<i>what the hell is that?</i>

This is "road crew from hell."
It's a low-budget movie.

<i>It starts up tomorrow.</i>

Your agent called.
What's the good news?

He said he had a job.
They're all the same.

Bitch, you been
holding out on your man?

I would never dare,
'cause you'd cut my ass.

Missy, ass ain't a
word we likes to hear.

I'm gonna take you down
to the pigley wigley.

Miles, he said
it was a dramatic lead.

Dramatic... lead?

"Dramatic lead."
That's what I said.

What is it, Harvey, "uptown Harlem pimps on crack"?
"Nightmare on 125th street"?

No, they're shooting in Florida.
It's a cute piece.

It's "raisin" something.
Raisin? Um...

you're not talking about
"raisin in the sun" are you?

Yeah. That sounds about right.

Harvey, are you kidding?

That's Lorraine hansbury.

It's the seminal black play.

I can't believe it. Harvey, I love you.
You're a Saint.

You're a good kid.
You're going to the top.

Here's your plane ticket.
Thanks, man.

Oh, did you do anything
about the audition?

What audition?

My audition for "othello"!

Oh, I did speak to them.

They're not sure your
singing voice is strong enough.

It's not a musical.
It's a play by Shakespeare.

It's on at the lyceum.

All right, I'm on it.

You... go to Florida.
Have a good time.

Work on your tan.

Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

Cute kid.

Harvey? Harvey!
You son-of-a-bitch!

This is a commercial
for breakfast cereal.

You said it was,
"a raisin in the sun."

No, you said it was, "a raisin in the
sun." I said, "raisin" something.

I'm an actor,
not a piece of fruit!

At least you're working!

Thanks for nothing, Harvey.

<i>Places, everybody.</i>
<i>Five-minute warning.</i>

<i>We are starting our pre-board,</i>
<i>flight 004,</i>

<i>nonstop service</i>
<i>from Orlando to New York.</i>

Hello, sir.

Pope, p-o-p-e.
I have a reservation.

P-o-p-e.

Miles pope. Here it is.

That flight's been over-booked.
You've been bumped.

It wasn't over-booked when I made the reservation.
It happens sometimes.

What's your name?
Paul. Paul shussler.

Paul, this is the champ's
home phone number.

The champ?
Tell him that Dr. Pope,

his personal psychiatrist,
has been delayed.

The boxing champion of the world?
Here, I'll do it!

Pardon me. Do you mind?
I'm in a hurry.

I said, I'm a medical person.

I have a beeper. Now, back off!

<i>This is Dr. Pope.</i>

Get the champ.
It's an emergency.

Oh, look! A first-class
seat just opened up.

I could just upgrade you.

First class?
Well, if that's all you have.

Would you like champagne, sir?
Champagne? Yeah, how much?

There's no charge.
Really?

Oh, yeah?

And you, sir? No, thank you.

I wonder if it would be possible
for me to change my seat?

The flight is completely full.

Thank you.

What's up? Miles pope.

How do you do? Hey.

Wait! Leland carver?

The leland...
you're leland carver?

I thought I recognized you.
I saw your picture.

You're the guy who's putting on the
Shakespeare festival at the lyceum.

Would you mind terribly
if we don't speak?

We have to talk.
Do you believe in destiny?

No.

Me neither. Total bullshit.

Could you get me an audition in "othello"?
I'm an actor.

Of course you are.

I have nothing to do
with that end of the business.

Just put in a word for me. My agent's
Harvey Cooper. I'm Miles pope.

Remember that name.
I'm real good.

I'll do what I can.

Did I tell you I was
in town doing a movie?

Major dramatic lead, major!

Do you die in this movie?

<i>Atlantic northern 117.</i>
<i>You are cleared to land.</i>

<i>Previous flights report</i>
<i>wind shear 1,500 feet.</i>

They weren't kidding
about that wind shear.

We're 30 knots below reference.

<i>Get the power on fast!</i>

We're losing altitude fast.
Prepare for emergency landing.

This ain't turbulence!
This is bullshit!

There ain't no pilot in here.
This is just a closet.

I need to speak to the pilot.
Take your seat!

<i>A fur coat can't fly a plane.</i>
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

A fur coat can't fly a plane!

Not the hair, not the hair!

Could I have 100 more of these pillows?
Hey! Get a grip on yourself.

I don't want to die. Shut the
fuck up and stop sniveling.

You're gonna die
so die like a man.

Linda, I've had an
affair with Jackie.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

It's okay. It's okay?

I've been having an affair
with Jackie too. What?

I'm scared! You're scared?

Kid, you ever hear of Frankie luchino?
Frank luchino?

Sure. Mafia guy. Blew up on a boat.
Uh-uh.

You're sitting next to
Frankie luchino.

You're gonna die
next to royalty.

You know how many guys I iced?
Nobody could get me.

I spent thousands of bucks on plastic
surgery, years establishing a new I.D.

I outsmarted the fucking FBI...

And it's gonna end
like this. Geez!

I'm gonna croak on a plane
next to a fucking actor.

Well, I'll see you
in hell, kid.

We're still minus 30.

Stewardess, could
I get another seat?

Air speed's coming back.

<i>Air speed, holding steady.</i>

Thank you, God. <i>Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the captain.</i>

<i>We just encountered some</i>
<i>very severe turbulence.</i>

<i>Everything's okay and we should be on
the ground in just under one minute.</i>

Shit!

For crying out loud!

I got him, I got him!

Hey! What the...

I want to report an attempt
on my life. Mm-hmm.

Have a seat. Be with you in a second.
This is kinda important.

Where am I supposed to sit?

Nice try, pal.

I came to report a crime. So
does everybody who comes in.

I didn't do anything. I know.

Hello? This is ridiculous.

I came here to report a crime.
I'm reporting a crime too.

Stand here, face forward
and shut up.

That's him! Number four, that's him.
Number four.

Wait a second. Me?
You're kidding.

Look, I'm a victim,
not a perpetrator.

That's the man who flashed me.

What? I was a boy scout.

Guys, just chill out.

Or maybe...

Number one. Huh?

Sorry about that. I was
wondering where you went.

Things like that
happen all the time.

No shit! So what are you gonna do about
this mob guy who's trying to kill me?

You're gonna have
to talk to the FBI.

Have a nice day. Thanks, man.
Thanks for nothing.

Shit, I'm glad
I don't pay no taxes.

Â¶ How'd you like to find this Â¶

Â¶ waitin' at home
for you every night Â¶

Â¶ only been used
once or twice Â¶

Â¶ but it's still
good and tight Â¶

<i>Â¶ but if I can't sell it Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I'm going to remain</i>
<i>seated on it Â¶</i>

Martha, you seen Duane? Â¶ I don't
see the need to give it away Â¶

you're questioning my sincerity?
Yes.

What do I have to do
to prove...

Aaah!

Oh, God! You're insane.

I'll cut the whole hand off,
but I gotta have you tonight.

We just met ten minutes ago!

I gotta talk to you.
Not now, Miles.

This is serious.
Karen, your phone number?

The thing is plastic.
He does this all the time.

Wait a minute, he's right!

Karen, I think I can explain.

Sorry, man, I had to do it.
I'm in big, fucking trouble.

You're goddamn right
you're in trouble.

I met this guy on the plane.

We were sitting next to each other
when we had this emergency.

Everybody was flipping out except for this guy.
He was beyond fear.

He started telling me he was Frankie
luchino, the one everybody thinks is dead.

He's got this new identity
and he's trying to kill me.

These things happen. What the
fuck is that supposed to mean?

What's the problem? You moved
eight times in the past year!

You got finance companies
looking for you.

If they can't find you,
how will this guy?

I don't know. <i>Listen, Miles,</i>

I wouldn't steer you wrong.
I'm your best friend.

It's over.
He'll never find you.

Good, good.

Hello, Lulu.

Welcome back, Mr. Carver.
Nice to see you.

Thank you. Is my wife at home?
Yes, she is.

That will be all. Thank you.
Very well.

Come here.

I want you to call Tony
in Vegas.

Find me somebody reliable, somebody
I don't know and who don't know me.

By this time tomorrow, I want that pope kid dead.
Boss, it's no big deal.

What can this black guy
prove anyway?

He can set the FBI thinking.

I've been legitimate
far too long.

They take my fingerprints,
I'm fucked.

You had your fingerprints removed.
They can grow back.

I'll call Tony.

<i>Leland, darling.</i>
Hello, darling.

How was your trip?
Just business.

We missed you in Newport...

<i>And mommy sends her love.</i>

This is kristi. She's working
with Jeremy. Jeremy?

Our decorator. Yes, of course.

<i>Hello, kristi.</i>
Nice to meet you.

I'm sorry to be rude, but I have a
lot of calls to make to California.

Hey, who are you?

Where's Harvey?

Harvey's gone out for awhile.

I'm a friend of his from Vegas.
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

Magic Bruno and his performing
rabbits! Right?

That's right.

Harvey told me.
He booked you into the lounge.

Nice venue for a rabbit act.

We're very excited.

Yeah.

Maybe you better
show me some I.D.

No problem.

Now by heaven, my blood
begins my safer guides to rule.

And passion, having
my best judgment collied...

collied? Colley?

And passion, having my best judgment
collied, assays to lead the way.

Assays to lead the way.
All right.

Whoo! I gotta get outta here.

But that I loved
the gentle desdemona.

<i>We're talking about my life</i>
<i>and you ain't got time?</i>

What the guys at the desk
failed to tell you...

Is that I'm not in the field anymore.
This is data retrieval.

<i>I've got six reports to finish.</i>

I'd like to get outta here
sometime before Christmas.

This was your case!
I can't believe you don't care.

Look! I spent six years
chasing luchino.

I don't wanna spend...

<i>One more second</i>
<i>talking about him.</i>

Good-bye!

Where the hell have you been?

I've been looking for you all night.
What's the matter?

Nothing very important.

Just the mob's
trying to kill me.

<i>This is the real thing.</i> Tommy, can
you give us a couple of minutes?

Sorry, man.

Miles? Miles!

Are we gonna make love, or something?
<i>You know what happened to me?</i>

I'm walking out
of my apartment.

Suddenly there's bullets flying
and the Terminator's on my ass.

Someone is trying to kill you?

Ah, a breakthrough!
Why don't you go to the cops?

I went. Nobody believes me.

You gotta help me
disappear now!

Me help you disappear?
How many times? Yes!

Step into my office.

Thanks, man.

Just have a seat.
I'm gonna help you disappear.

A haircut ain't gonna make it.
This is not gonna be a haircut.

Neither is a massage. It's not
gonna be a massage either.

All right. Good.

<i>What are you doin', man?</i>
<i>What are you putting on me?</i>

<i>Keep still.</i>
<i>You're gonna look fabulous.</i>

Can I look yet? No,
keep your eyes closed.

This stuff needs
another second to dry.

Look, keep an open mind.

Okay.

All right.
You can open your eyes now.

Keep an open mind.

Aaah! You made me into a white guy?
I can't believe this!

What's the matter with you?
I wanted to look like prince.

You made me look like Wayne Newton
without the little mustache.

Relax. This is genius.
They're looking for a black guy.

You're a totally safe Caucasian
who's going to live.

Get this stuff off me.
Nobody is gonna believe...

That I am a white guy.
Why not?

Read my lips... Which for a white
person are extremely visible.

I do not want to be white!

You're an actor.

Look at this as
the performance for your life.

Don't give me that bullshit.
I traced my roots.

I know who I am
and it's not ward cleaver.

When I think of my favorite
people, a lot of 'em ain't white.

Do you have a better idea?

<i>Â¶ Release yourself Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ just let it go Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ said I gotta go underground Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ hallelujah to</i>
<i>the underground Â¶</i>

this ain't gonna make it,
brother.

Look at the way these
white people are walking.

<i>They walk with their</i>
<i>butts real tight.</i>

They're the reason God
invented talcum powder.

Look at him.

You're a crazy son-of-a-bitch.

Taxi?

Great. Hey?

Come on, man.
You know you see me.

There you go, brother.

Thanks, man. Peace.

Yo, lady, that's my cab.
I saw it first.

Lady, I gotta get outta town.
I'm in a hurry!

Greenwich village, man. Penn
station and take the park.

Wait a minute. Haven't we met?
I don't think so.

Your face is very familiar.
It's that kind of face.

I know! You're at the
bond desk at merrill lynch!

Andrea Clark, Dean witter. Yes,
I remember you had a long name.

And you're? Perry, Perry white.

Perry, of course. I'm terrible with
names but I never forget a face.

So, Perry, how have you been?

Oh, just great...
Since they let me out.

You're out of the business?
No, no, no.

Out of jail.
Insider dealing?

I got 4 to 6 hard for knocking
off a bank in queens.

I was in jail, had a
boyfriend, I was the wife.

Stop the cab! <i>Took steroids.</i>

Anytime, baby. I've been
pumping iron especially for you.

The village, man.

You want to confirm the hit?

Be here in 15. Yeah.

Maybe next time, brother.

Where is he?

Where's pope?

I'm not sure where he went.

Well, you've got a key.

I'm just sharing
the apartment...

Which has some exciting
upscale potential.

You been looking long?
I'm not looking.

This unit is a superb buy
for the low 6's.

<i>I know, you're thinking</i>
<i>"the war zone."</i>

But the war zone look
is going to be huge.

The neighborhood
is pre-transitional.

The unit has 7-foot ceilings...

That are highlighted
with gold fleck.

<i>Look, I have a 6-page brochure in my car.
Why don't I get it?</i>

Shut up.

What's with your feet?

My mother was black.
I'm a mulatto.

Just your feet?

No, from the waist down.
That's how it happens sometimes.

Yeah. Show me.

Duane, help me!

My radio.

Jesus. He put up a real fight.

I'm Anthony.
We talked on the phone.

Wait a minute. This isn't pope!

Miles pope is black.
Who's this guy?

He lives down the hall.
He was here feeding the fish.

He was just feeding the
fish and you whacked him?

Jesus, lamotta,
two civilians in one day.

<i>You still haven't found pope.</i>

<i>Jesus, carver's</i>
<i>gonna be pissed.</i>

<i>He was pissed when I told</i>
<i>him about the janitor.</i>

We better keep this one
between us.

<i>I know a place</i>
<i>we can dump the body.</i>

<i>I used to use it all the time.</i>

So you wanna use my car
or yours?

Let's take yours.
I think I'm gonna dump mine.

Smart, smart. Careful.
I like that.

What are you doing?
I took my shoes off.

Always do when I fight.
Better traction.

You're a fucking animal.
Get the other end.

What? Get his feet.

We'll roll him up in the carpet.
We'll take him down.

Jesus! He weighs a ton!

I think we should chop him up and
take him down piece by piece.

Come on. Get the other end.

Talk of memories, huh?

I've used this place
a hundred times.

I feel like
a fucking kid again.

So, lamotta,
what kind of gun you use?

Gun?

Right. Well, you know...

I use what I always use.

Which is what? Nemmler... 86.

Nemmler?
Never heard of that gun.

It's a new company.
I got a promotional model.

86 caliber?
That's a big number.

What do you do
about the recoil?

You don't have to worry.
It's self-coiling.

Self-coiling.
Never heard of that either.

I feel like I just got into the business.
Should be taking notes.

Excuse me.

Yeah. Hi, boss.

No, pope wasn't there.

Lamotta? Hey, lamotta?

That was the boss.
He wants to see you.

He wants to see me? Now? Uh-huh.

I'll call him... Tomorrow.

If the man wants to see you,
you go to see him.

Otherwise he can get
very upset.

And we wouldn't want that,
would we?

Oh, and don't worry.
I didn't mention the stiff.

Paisans, right?

Come on!

<i>What are you gonna do?</i>
<i>Leave roses?</i>

Leland, you can't pretend...

Sponsorship of the arts
isn't a perfect tax deduction.

I'm not saying it doesn't
make financial sense.

But that's really not why
I'm involved, senator.

Culture is the lifeblood
of New York City.

Without it, we may as well
be living in Los Angeles.

<i>That's very good.</i>

Mr. Carver, I brought
Mr. Lamotta like you said.

Gentlemen,

I wonder if you'd excuse me?

A little urgent business
has come up.

I won't be a moment. Certainly.

Watch how I handle this.

What the fuck have you got in there?
Meatballs?

You said to bring him. Not
through the goddamn front door.

<i>I've got a senator</i>
<i>and the d.A. Out there.</i>

Sorry, boss. I wasn't thinking.

What the hell have you
got to say for yourself?

It's been a day and a half.

Pope is still alive and the only stiff
you brought me is a lousy janitor.

These things happen.

What is that supposed to mean?
It means what it means.

I'm paying you 100 grand
and you are giving me attitude?

I want this taken care
of quick and quiet.

What is the problem here, huh?

He's just a kid, a lousy actor.

There's too many of 'em anyway.

If you can't handle this,
tell me now...

And I'll get somebody else
for half the price.

No-no-no. I'm your man.

I want pope dead!
You understand?

You rip him open, cut
him up and make sandwiches.

Understand? Do it
by tomorrow morning.

Sandwiches. Tomorrow morning.
Piece of cake.

So, how's Tony?

Tony?

Tony's Tony. You know Tony.

He'll always be... Tony.
Capisci?

Yeah.

Fucking a. Fucking a.

He's never gonna change, right?
No! He's never gonna change.

Hey! Hey.

<i>Leland?</i> Hello, darling.

Dear, I thought you were
still with the politicians.

I was, but there's no problem if
you'd like to measure in here.

I don't believe we've met.

This is Mr. Lamont.

He's a friend of mine
from Florida.

Mr. Lamont is more
interested in kristi.

It's, um... I mean...

Ah... you look
just like my sister.

Hmm.

By marriage! Sister-in-law.

Well, she is the most
beautiful decorator.

And she's doing our whole house.
If ever you need...

I'll keep it in mind.

We'll let you finish.
We'll see you in a moment.

Kristi, let's go do
the bedrooms.

Tomorrow morning.

S-s-shit!

<i>Is this the FBI?</i>

Could you put me through
to Mr. Houston, please?

This is Miles pope, again.

<i>Tell him I called.</i>

So... this is how you
white people live?

Not bad!

Have some room service. I ordered
the whole left side of the menu.

Miles, you should join
a support group.

What?
A support group.

Where people in the same situation get together.
<i>The same situation?</i>

I'm passing for white. I've been
hired to find and kill myself.

That's a common problem.
That's a fucking epidemic!

Miles, calm down, man.

I can't calm down.

The whole white-face makeup
thing is a nightmare.

I gotta get my life back. I'm gonna go
home and say, "mammy, don't you know me?"

Wait a minute!
There was a girl.

She worked for Mrs. Carver.
She was a decorator.

All right!
Maybe she knows something.

She's been all over that house.
Maybe she's seen a secret safe.

All right.

Hello, I'd like to speak
to Mrs. Rita carver, please.

Thank you.

Rita, darling. Hello.

It's lord Percy chisley
pithee-Smythe...

Of South worchestershire
upon avon.

<i>I want to speak to you</i>
<i>about your decorator.</i>

<i>Everyone is talking about her.</i>

That's marvelous.

Yes. Uh-huh.

Soho! How spiffy.

Wonderful!
Thank you, Rita, darling.

Love you more than
life itself. Ciao.

Duane, listen.

Do you still have the key to
your wardrobe department?

Who'd you say you were?
Darryl brown, James' brother.

James brown. <i>The</i> James brown?

Hey!

Hit man! Right on, baby.

<i>A friend of mine gave me</i>
<i>your name. Rita carver?</i>

You know Rita?
Yeah, I'm into art and shit.

She told me you was doing some
radical bullshit up here.

I'm loaded and ready to buy.

Do you mind if I take a look around?
Well, come...

what a delightful apartment.
Very urban. Good God.

Hey! Looks like massio!

Ohhh! I love doors!

My house is full of doors.
I'll buy it.

How do you know Rita carver?

She's a friend of James'.
They dated for awhile.

<i>Don't tell nobody</i>
<i>I told you that.</i>

I hates to gossip,

but have you heard that
rumor about her old man?

About how he's some big-time mobster?
Had his face redone.

Don't be ridiculous.
Who you calling ridiculous?

<i>You never seen any little</i>
<i>secret hiding places?</i>

<i>Or one secret room?</i>

Or places where you're
never supposed to go?

Have you got any I.D. On you?

This one is real superb.

I love the way the jeans bunch up
into his... you're bullshitting me!

Mrs. Carver never dated
no James brown.

I swear on my
brother's parole board.

Aaah!

You nuked me! You'll
be shaky for awhile.

Start talking!

I'm an actor. Miles pope.

I'm in a lot of trouble.
I need your help.

What are you talking about?
Leland carver.

That's what this is about! You're trying to
pump me for information about my client.

Your client is trying to kill me.
Give me a break!

You haven't said a truthful word.
Now you expect me to believe this?

I can explain.

All right. Just don't
"taze" me again.

Look... I really
did like the door.

Only in New York.

Hello?

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here, Mr. "No-pants"...
Or do I need to ask?

No, you don't have to ask.
<i>Duane, honey,</i>

<i>is that the champagne</i>
<i>and lobster you ordered?</i>

No, cherise, it's the maid.

Come here, man.

The mob's trying to kill me and you're
ordering champagne and lobster?

Some guy called who said
his name was... Anthony.

<i>He wanted you to confirm</i>
<i>if the package was delivered.</i>

If not, he would make
other arrangements.

Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

<i>What does it mean?</i>

<i>Are you gonna leave now?</i>

I'm gonna make a phone call.
Is that okay?

It's okay, but can you
not make it too long?

Cherise doesn't like
a lot of noise.

It breaks her concentration.

Hello. Can I speak
to Mr. Carver, please?

It's a matter
of life and death.

Tell him it's Mr. Lamont
from Florida.

Where is he?

Golf course? Which golf course?

Can you get in touch with him?

When are you
expecting him back?

Shit no.
I can't wait that long.

<i>If I'm lying, I'm flying.</i>

You're the first brother
I had in here all day.

<i>When I say "brother"...</i>

I mean African-American.

It's crucial for people
to remember their heritage.

Absolutely. <i>Brothers today don't
want to know about the struggle.</i>

<i>I start talkin' about</i>
<i>the struggle, they say,</i>

<i>"step on it, please.</i>
<i>I'm in a hurry."</i>

I'm kinda in a rush myself.

Uncle Toms and wanna-be's, man.

They don't know who they are,
Brooks brothers suits and all.

<i>They're ashamed of themselves.
</i> I heard that.

We, as a people,
gotta stand up...

And say "we're black
and we're proud of it."

<i>Right?</i> Absolutely.

There's only one way for a black man
to make it in a white man's world.

Great googa-mooga!

Where's Mr. Carver playing? I
don't believe he's started yet.

He's probably still in
the locker room. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Mr. Carver, I believe
we have a visitor.

I didn't know you were a member
of this club, Mr. Lamont.

We gotta talk.

I don't discuss business
in public. Kindly leave.

We have to talk.
This business is important.

Come with me.

Now what's so
fucking important?

It's about pope. I need a
little more time. More time?

I'm not asking you to whack the
president of the United States.

This is some fucking actor
with no talent and no future.

I want him
permanently cancelled.

I don't know. I hear it's only
time before he makes it real big.

What?

Geez, it's hot in here.

Whoo! I don't want
no more excuses.

Either you whack this spook
or I get somebody else.

Spook?

Yeah, spook.
You've got 24 hours.

And if you don't mind,
I wanna start my game...

Unless you got something
else on your tiny mind.

Hey.

Hey...

What's that black shit
running down your forehead?

What? Yeah... You
got black shit.

It's disgusting.

Oh, shit! It's...

It's my hair dye.

Every time I do a job,
I change my hair color...

In case there's, you know,
witnesses.

You leave witnesses? No, no, course not.
I'm a professional.

It's been nice talkin' to you,
but I really gotta go.

I got a lot of whacking to do.

Another day,
another whack-a-roonio.

Lamotta, first you whack
Miles pope.

Then you whack the guy
who gave you that dye job.

Make a mental note. Kill Duane.

All right.

What are these? All from the
same person, Miles pope.

Pope? The actor who told you
the luchino fairy tale.

He's been calling every
two-and-a-half minutes.

Look, kid. I wanna believe you.

Luchino cost me my marriage,

my job and
the lives of five agents.

Jesus, I need to believe you.

But as far as
the bureau is concerned,

you're another crackpot
and I'm another old-timer.

What counts as hard evidence
apart from a bullet in my chest?

Anything that connects
carver with his old life.

He's gotta have an office,
somewhere where he works.

<i>You gotta get in and search it.</i>

Me?

This may come as
a surprise to you,

but not every black person from the
inner city is good at that shit.

I never ripped off
a car stereo. Ever!

It seems to me, Miles,

if you are telling the truth...

<i>You got nothing to lose.</i>

Either you find something
and I bring him in...

Or you're a dead man,
my friend.

<i>Hey, kristi.</i>

Give me a minute.
I need to talk to you.

I thought I made myself clear.
You're pissed off,

I know. Let me explain.

The Darryl brown thing
was bullshit. I'm sorry.

These are for you.
You probably stole them.

You bet, I had to
break into the flower shop.

Leland carver has
hired someone to kill me.

My friend made me white.
But you're black.

At the moment. Whenever
I need to be, I'm white.

You're insane. It's my
life that's insane.

You gotta believe me
'cause I need you to help.

I really do.
Miles, you're cute.

Call me when you're better.

Kristi.

Here you go, brother.
Thank you, brother.

<i>Check this out, man.</i>

Yo, man, you're
a long way from home.

You lost or stupid?

<i>I think he's stupid.</i>
<i>You'll get hurt, white boy.</i>

Around here my favorite
people ain't white.

Hi.

Mr. Lamont, Mr. Carver's
friend from Florida.

Kristi, you don't know
how wrong you are.

Miles?

<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>we're doing this.</i>

<i>I want my life back.
Do you think anybody's home?</i>

They're at sotheby's.

I marked a bunch of stuff
in the catalog. Let's go.

Did you get a key? Yes.

I'll go in here.
You take the bedroom.

Miles... we don't have time.

Hey. Hey!

I don't have time for this.

Honey, whose car is that?

It's kristi. She must
be here with the fabric.

<i>Kristi?</i>

<i>Hello, kristi.</i>

Are you here with the swatches?
No, no, no.

I had to remeasure the uh...

the master bedroom.

They didn't lose
the measurements again?

First, it was the tile.
Now, it's the curtains.

I've got to make phone calls.
I'll be in my study.

No. Is there a problem?

No, no.

Oh my God! Oh my God!

I would like you to look at the
valances in the guest bedroom.

I'll take a look. First, I'm
going to make some phone calls.

Hi.

Frankie, salut.

What the fuck
are you doing here?

What am I doing here?

I could ask you
the same question.

I live here.
You live here.

I'm asking
the goddamned questions.

Mr. Lamont and I have
business. Leave us alone.

Close the door, please.

You got 10 seconds to tell
me what you're doing here...

<i>Or I am gonna tear the</i>
<i>heart outta your chest,</i>

and rip that nose
off your face.

<i>And give me those!</i>

The fact is, I got good news.
Miles pope...

<i>Is dead.</i>

<i>I want confirmation.</i>

Ah, well,

confirmation?

The thing is, you know,

when you said sandwiches
you gave me inspiration.

I ripped off his head.
I made minestrone outta brains.

I ripped out his intestines.
That was chow mein.

I crunched his nuts and
sprinkled 'em like croutons.

<i>The guy is dead.</i>
I'll send Anthony.

Don't leave town.
Get outta my house.

<i>Beat it. I never wanna</i>
<i>see your face again.</i>

You're the boss, of course.

It's beautiful.

It's fucking beauti...

he bought it.

I told you, man.
<i>- Thanks, man.</i>

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

I should get an Oscar.
First, get me out.

Oh, sure.

Can you believe this?

Oh, God.

You look lovely. Thanks.
Let's get some pizza.

<i>Miles?</i>

Hey, where you been?

Been looking
everywhere for you.

How'd you find me? Your friend told me...
The crazy guy.

Duane. Great. Now take a hike.

I love your sense
of humor. Now listen.

I managed to get
you that audition.

What audition?
Othello, 4:00.

It opens Friday.
It'll be cast by now.

Trust me. Their lead got sick.

James Earl Jones got sick?

Whoever. They gotta recast.
You wanna kiss me?

<i>Right there.</i>

Had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction,

had they rained down all
kinds of sores and shames...

Upon my bare head...

thank you, that was...
thank you.

Hi, Miles. I wanna talk to you.

Listen. This is crazy.

Even if you get the part
you can't take it.

Carver will know
you're still alive.

I can't take the part
but I can audition.

I've worked too long for a
break like this to flush it.

I've wanted to do this
since I was nine years old.

No matter what, I want to
know if I could have made it.

Miles pope, please.

<i>Miles pope, please.</i>

Good I... break a leg.

All right, we're ready.

Excuse me, you
forgot your script.

It's all right.
I know the play.

Had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction,

had they rained all kinds of
sores and shames on my head,

steeped me in poverty
to the very lips,

given to captivity
me and my utmost hopes,

I should have found in
some place of my soul...

<i>A drop of patience.</i>

But there where
I have guarded my heart,

<i>where either I must</i>
<i>live or bear no life,</i>

the fountain from the
which my current runs...

thank you.

<i>Thank you, that</i>
<i>was amazingly good.</i>

We don't have to look further.
You are the understudy.

The understudy?

The understudy!

Your agent didn't... oh!

This is an emergency call.
We open tomorrow.

Our understudy got sick.
The understudy got sick?

My agent told me I'd
be reading for the lead...

To replace James Earl Jones.
Afraid not, kid.

You're good, but
you're not that good.

You were fantastic. I gave my last
performance and I got the understudy.

Why does it have to be
the last performance?

There are actors in Detroit.
You can start over.

I don't want to start over.
This is my home.

I like being me.
I like being Miles pope.

Well, if it makes
you feel better,

I like Miles pope too.

And I don't want him
to leave either.

Really?

Do you feel better?

Maybe if we, uh,
did it for longer,

you know, deeper.
We might get more of a benefit.

Yeah, that did it. Yeah.

I know this place.
It's a hotel.

They serve champagne
and they have a vibrating bed.

<i>It's a wonderful thing.</i>
<i>I think you should see it.</i>

Â¶ Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah Â¶

Good morning.

Hello, darling.

You're up early.
Something wrong?

On the contrary,
something is very right.

Excuse me.

Good morning, boss.

Anthony,

who's the guy you
brought into my home?

The guy I talked to
in the steam room?

Frank lamotta? Oh, yeah?

Then who the fuck is this?

I don't know. You don't know?

I don't get it.
You don't get it?

The guy I brought here is
the guy who killed pope.

You told me
Miles pope was dead.

He is dead. I saw him sprinkled
all over his apartment.

It made me throw up.

This is beginning to
make me feel stupid.

I don't like to feel stupid.

Get over to lamotta's hotel.
Find out what is going on.

<i>Yes, boss.</i>

To think I looked up to you.

I thought you were
the best there was...

When you were the white guy.

I tried to order one of those
self-coiling nemmler 86's.

I hate to tell you this,
but there is no such thing.

Now, to find out you
were lying to me,

leading me on.

I have to tell you,
I'm genuinely hurt.

Would it do any good
if I said I was sorry?

No, it wouldn't do any good.

But you know what?

Splattering your brains over
this bed's gonna make me better.

Are you okay? No, I'm dead.

Look at this. Did you kill him?

I can't believe this.

Carver must know
I'm still alive.

We gotta get outta here now!

No, we have Anthony.
We can take him to the FBI.

He'll deny everything. They have
that code of silence thing.

He'll never talk.

Carver will never stop.
I'm a dead man.

Miles. He'll track me
down like an animal.

Miles. Year after year, day
after day, week after week.

I'm fucking dead.

He's gonna corner
me like a rat.

What'd you do that for? You do
that when someone's babbling.

Did you have to hit me so hard?

Will you help me tie him up?
Yeah.

I've seen Kojak.
I know how to do this.

Do you want me...
turn him over.

He's so heavy. He's a mobster.
What do you expect?

Why can't you put
pressure on him?

Make him believe the bureau's
taking Miles seriously.

There's nothing I can do.
Wait a minute.

There's got to be
something we can do.

There is.

I can't believe
that punk fooled me.

Me!

He fooled me too, boss.

King Kong in a dress
would fool you.

Boss, I think we got a tail.

They look like feds.

You don't think they're
startin' to believe pope?

Take me home, Anthony.

Well?
Guido's man in the bureau...

Said he hadn't heard
anything about surveillance.

But pope has been with
Houston 3 or 4 times,

so he didn't rule it out.

Houston? Oh, Jesus.

I called pope's agent.

Guy didn't know
anything, except...

what?

He said pope wasn't
going anywhere...

'Cause he'd gotten the
understudy to the lead...

In your "othello."

Miles pope
got a part in my play?

He combined sensitivity
with great strength.

Shut up! This kid's
playing with me.

It ain't gonna last.

Get to his apartment. See if
he's got feds protecting him.

Yes, boss.

Oh, Jesus.

Oh, f...

<i>Class, Miles. Well acted.</i>

Excellent method.

All of you, everyone
was wonderfully...

Fascist!

Thank you.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

Dessert menu, gentlemen.
Thank you.

Gelati's homemade here
and the tiramisu...

shut the fuck up, Anthony,
and let me think.

They must be coaching
him for the grand jury.

<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

Once the feds sniff, it's gonna be a
piece of cake to find out who I am.

We're gonna have to take him out
before he gets a chance to testify.

It's gonna be tough.
Feds got him 'round the clock.

Need a bazooka.
Must be a way to flush him out.

Must be some bait
we can set to stop him...

Before he gets
a chance to testify.

You got something?

Get the car.
I've got a job for you.

I could not believe it.

I step out my front door and there's
this car comin' 100 Miles an hour.

We'll have to cancel.

Forget it.
You got a good understudy.

You don't understand.
This is a gala opening.

We have the mayor coming.
We have big names.

We can't go with an unknown.

Miles pope is
gonna be terrific.

I think he'll surprise you.

Tell him othello's not jealous.

Iago's jealous.
Othello's crazy.

Critics will love it.

I believe that
this kid is for real.

You have more gall than is
healthy for an FBI man.

You're lucky I'm not busting
you down to the mail room...

After the stunt you
pulled with those actors.

If carver was just
another millionaire,

why would he try to have the lead
in his own play knocked off...

<i>The day before</i>
<i>the play is to open?</i>

You have no proof.

Carver believes
we are listening to pope.

He knows the way to shut
him up is to kill him.

He knows he has
to flush him out.

He's trying to get
his guy a clear shot.

I'm sorry, there's no way
I can authorize this.

I was one of your
best agents for 15 years.

You trusted my instincts
and I always came through.

Carver is luchino.
I can feel it!

<i>I'll give you my badge</i>
<i>and my pension...</i>

If I'm wrong, but
I believe this kid.

I want this chance,

sir.

All units, mark's in position.

God, I'm nervous.
Don't worry, I'll be great.

I'm not worried
about your performance.

There's feds everywhere.
There's nothing to worry about.

Okay, do well.

See you later. I'll
see you later.

God, I'm nervous. I'll be fine.

Listen, I know you're
doing Shakespeare.

There's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
But whatever you do,

just keep moving, don't stay
in the same place too long.

I'll try my best. Okay, yeah.

I'm nervous. Don't be nervous.

Get out of here.
Let me get that.

Love you, man. Love you.

God, I'm nervous.

I discovered him,
plucked him from obscurity.

Taught him everything he knows.
Excuse me.

That's bullshit.
I discovered him.

Pay no attention
to this self-publicist.

I'm Harvey Cooper, Miles' agent.
That's my number.

Isn't that too typical? They'll
be coming out of the woodwork.

<i>Look where he comes.</i>

I will not leave him now
till cassio be called.

How is it with you, my lord?

Well, my good lady.

O, hardness to dissemble.

<i>How do you, desdemona?</i>
<i>Well, my good lord.</i>

<i>Give me your hand.</i>

This hand requires sequester from
liberty, fasting and prayer,

<i>much castigation,</i>
<i>exercise devout.</i>

'Twas that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.

<i>The hearts of old gave hands,</i>

<i>but our new heraldry</i>
<i>is hands, not hearts.</i>

<i>- Come now, your promise.</i>
<i>- What promise?</i>

<i>I have sent to bid</i>
<i>cassio come speak with you.</i>

Anthony's moving toward
the lobby, center aisle.

That handkerchief did
an Egyptian to my mother give.

<i>She was a charmer and could</i>
<i>read the thoughts of people.</i>

Picked up something that
looked like a gun case.

<i>He went upstairs.</i> Let's do it.

<i>I did so and take heed on't.</i>

<i>Make it a darling</i>
<i>like your precious eye.</i>

To lose't or give't away were such
perdition as nothing else could match.

<i>- Is't true?</i>
<i>- Most veritable.</i>

<i>- Look well.</i>
<i>- Would to God I never seen't.</i>

Why do you speak so rash? Is't lost?
Is't gone? Speak!

<i>- Say you.</i>
<i>- It's not lost.</i>

<i>But what an if it were?</i>
<i>I say it is not lost.</i>

Fetch't, let me see it.

<i>This is a trick.</i>

Fetch me the handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

<i>You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
</i> The handkerchief.

The handkerchief. <i>A man that all his
time hath his fortunes on your love,</i>

shared dangers with you.
The handkerchief.

Gentlemen?

<i>- Tempt heaven.</i>
<i>- The handkerchief.</i>

By heaven, I would most
gladly have forgot it.

O, it comes o'er my memory as doth
the raven o'er the infected house.

<i>He had my handkerchief.</i>

<i>Ay, what of that?</i>

That's not so good now.
O, blood,

blood, blood...

oh, my God, he's been shot!

Whoa, my blood!

Oh, my God.

<i>O God, why does</i>
<i>thou punish me so?</i>

<i>Blood doth pour out</i>
<i>of my open chest.</i>

My boyfriend!

Would that I could know my assassin
and confront him with his name?

Which play is this?

But hark, there he sits.

<i>Beneath his cloak</i>
<i>of respectability...</i>

Doth a scoundrel lurk.

O Francis, why does thou
seek to have me slain,

<i>when a promise made upon the plane
to have your secret here remain,</i>

when now my life's
blood does stain...

what's he talking about, leland?
I have no idea.

Come on, you do so.

My pal, Duane,
he rigged the vest.

Why don't you stay dead?

Sorry, this is one spook
that just won't stay whacked.

Capisci?

It's all over, Frank.

<i>I've waited 11 years for this.</i>

Frank luchino, you're under arrest.
Yeah!

This is ridiculous. I don't
know what you're talking about.

My name is leland carver.

Great story. Why don't
you keep telling it?

It was carver!

Leland, you're Frank luchino?

No wonder we never paid for
anything in Las Vegas.

Put cuffs on him.

Oh, by the way.

<i>When you get to the joint,</i>

talk to some of the brothers.

They'll be dying to hear your
views on racial equality.

Get him outta here! Yeah!

No matter how many
times I see Shakespeare,

I always get
something new out of it.

Bravo! Bravo, Miles!

If he doesn't get here,
if he messes this up...

he ain't gonna mess it up.
He'll get here.

He'll get here. All right.

Miles! Miles!

<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

I'm sorry. I got held up.
I met this girl.

Miles, she's perfect.
Save it, man.

I got your tickets.
Thanks, man.

I always come through,
even if it is late.

Come here. Okay.

Thanks for everything. Have a good one.
I gotta go.

You're under arrest, huh?
Yeah, I'm under arrest.

Make sure you get
that one phone call.

Watch that choke hold. Stop.

Well, she might.

<i>May I help you?</i>

Atlantic northern? Isn't
this the airline you took...

this flight is overbooked.

I thought we'd bump
you to first class.

How does that sound?

I gotta tell you, kristi.

I've learned some important
lessons from all this stuff.

You have? Uh-huh.

Like there's black,
there's white...

And there's meaningful
shades of gray.

Other thing is...

First class sucks.

First class really sucks.

I think you know what
I'm talking about.

Come here, girl. I think I do.

You know I love you. Mm-mm.
