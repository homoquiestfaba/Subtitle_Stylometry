[# "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" plays]

<i>[woman] I believe in America.</i>

<i>I believe we are the best.</i>

<i>I believe we're number one.</i>

<i>And I won't apologize for that.</i>

<i>My husband and I are survivors.</i>

<i>We fought tooth and nail to
get to where we are today.</i>

<i>How? The old-fashioned way:</i>

<i>hard work and
a can-do attitude.</i>

<i>And here in the great state
of Iowa no less,</i>

<i>where all great battles begin.</i>

<i>My name is Laura Dean Pickler</i>

<i>and this is the cutthroat story</i>

<i>of greed, blackmail,
sex and butter.</i>

[crickets chirring]


Bob Pickler, where are ya?

Ah, there you are.
Stand up for us, please.

<i>[Laura] That's us.
The Picklers. Bob and Laura.</i>

<i>We were the royal family
of butter carving.</i>

<i>Oh, sure, laugh.
But did you know more people</i>

<i>saw the butter sculptures of
the Iowa State Fair last year</i>

<i>than went to the Super Bowl?
No, of course you didn't.</i>

<i>[whispers] How could you, with the
liberal media as biased as it is?</i>

Would you dim
the lights, please?

Sit down and watch this.

<i>Oh, I come to the Iowa State Fair every
year and that's mainly because of Bob.</i>

<i>[man narrating] Born into poverty
in Battle Creek, Iowa in 1968,</i>

<i>Bob Pickler found solace
in his best friend,</i>

<i>- a young calf named Suki.
[cow mooing]</i>

<i>But tragedy arrived when Bob
was just eight years old.</i>

<i>Suki was struck dead
by lightning.</i>

<i>Distraught, Bob carved
a likeness of his beloved Suki</i>

<i>with the only thing the Picklers had
in the icebox... a block of butter.</i>

<i>Even though his mother destroyed
young Bob's first sculpture,</i>

<i>Bob was bit by the
butter-carving bug.</i>

<i>He first entered the
Mastery in Butter competition</i>

<i>15 years ago,
his lovely wife Laura</i>

<i>encouraging him
every step of the way.</i>

<i>With a controversial,
yet staggeringly elegant piece</i>

<i>titled
"Newt Gingrich on Horse."</i>

<i>Hey, hon.
What do you think?</i>

<i>[Laura] Look at Newt.</i>

<i>Oh, it's great.
How do you like my haircut?</i>

<i>I'd better like it.
It cost me 15 bucks.</i>

<i>I'm worth it.</i>

<i>[Bob laughing]</i>

<i>Get over here. Aww!</i>

<i>[man] Thus began his
unprecedented winning streak</i>

<i>that included the world-famous
"T-Rex Eating Girl."</i>

<i>- [growling sounds]
[girl screams]</i>

<i>- Well, back in '94...
It was '95.</i>

<i>- Well, '94...
It was '95.</i>

<i>OK. We'll call it '95.
'94, actually, but...</i>

<i>Bob comes out and reveals his piece.
"Schindler's List."</i>

<i>"Schindler's [beep] List!"</i>

<i>- Here we go.
Sorry.</i>

<i>It just made me cry.</i>

<i>And we're not even Jewish.</i>

<i>[man] But no one could imagine
the showstopper</i>

<i>the boy from Battle Creek
would pull out this year.</i>

<i>A life-size replica
of "The Last Supper"</i>

<i>that the Des Moines Register
called "better than the original."</i>

<i>I really think Bob and I
could parlay this fame</i>

<i>we have from butter
into politics.</i>

<i>I mean, don't be surprised if you
see us in the Governor's mansion,</i>

<i>or the White House.</i>

<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

[# Orleans: "Still The One"]

Bob Pickler,
ladies and gentlemen!

Fifteen wonderful years!

<i>[Laura] Butter was my world...</i>

<i>...until it all came
crashing down.</i>

<i>[girl] If you can believe it, the
first time I saw Mrs. Pickler</i>

<i>I actually wished she and
Mr. Pickler would take me in.</i>

<i>[Laura on TV] You know, of
course the awards are wonderful.</i>

<i>But what is most satisfying
to me, and to Bob,</i>

<i>is the attention we bring
to our charity, Camp Butter.</i>

<i>- Yes.
Where we help children with special needs.</i>

<i>[girl] The foster people had just
put me with a bunch of families</i>

<i>and anyone had to
be better than them.</i>

<i>First was the Moores.</i>

<i>They were home-schoolers,
which always spells trouble.</i>

And then God
cast down the angels

and they fell to earth,

which is where
dinosaur bones come from.

<i>[girl] Next came Mrs. Carmichael.
She was on pills.</i>

Just tell the doctor you've been
anxious lately and you need Klonopin.

OK. Klonopin.

You're gonna be such
a great daughter.

<i>- I liked her.
Stupid child-proof cap.</i>

<i>She was always so calm.</i>

Here, you try.

<i>- [sirens]
Too calm to run from the police, I guess.</i>

[Mrs. Carmichael]
They're not mine!

<i>- So after that came the Gundersons.
[cat meows]</i>

<i>They were old.</i>

The red button is
for the ambulance.

Tell her about the red button.
[ambulance siren]

<i>So you can understand why I wasn't
on to Mrs. Pickler's bull sooner.</i>

<i>Plus, I was only
ten at the time.</i>

<i>Now that I'm 11,
I know the truth.</i>

<i>White people are weirdos.</i>

Did they find my mom yet?

Come on, sweetheart.
It's late.

Your room's still empty.

Thank you.

[# Fitz and the Tantrums:
"Pickin' Up The Pieces"]



Wow!

Laura Dean Pickler!

Hi, Carol Ann Stevenson.
Hey, Carol Ann.

Look at you,
you look just amazing.

It's brave of you to wear stirrup
pants with your body type.

Thank you. My pants keep
riding up

and I need to
pull them down with my feet.

They're hard to find,

Ill say that, but I found 'em.


Can I have a look at that?

Wow.

You're good.

Really good.

A real natural.

You're a quiet one, aren't ya?

That's OK.
So was John Wayne, so...

Can I borrow this?

[Carol Ann] Bob makes butter
carving look so easy.

I even think I could do it
sometimes.

Then I'm like, "Wake up,
Carol Ann! You're in a dream!"

<i>[girl] That summer, they put me
with Miss Jill and Mr. Ethan.</i>

<i>- They were the whitest people I'd ever met.
[bicycle bell rings]</i>

<i>I wasn't expecting
to stay very long.</i>

<i>These people always
get cold feet.</i>

This will be your bedroom.

It's pink.

Yeah. I told her
to go with green.

No, it's pretty.

There's a TV?
Oh, yeah.

It's not HD though, so, sorry.

And no watching past eight.

Is that what we said, eight?

No TV past nine.
Nine, right.

Eight, what is this, prison?

"Lights out!"

[both laugh]

Um...

Is there anything you need?
No. Thank you.

What do you like to do for fun?
Do you have hobbies?

We can buy you some stuff,
like books or a globe.

I'm not really
that good at anything.

Oh... What? That's crazy.
Everybody's good at something.

Not me.
My last mom told me so.

Well, you don't have to worry about
stuff like that anymore, OK?

OK.
So if you need us, you know.

We'll be out there.
Yeah. "Paging Mom and Dad."


OK. OK.
All right.

<i>[Laura] One, two, three,
Camp Butter!</i>

I've always said that your
people are the small flashlights

that help a dark world
find its lost car keys.

What?
Let's hear it for Camp Butter!

<i>[Bob] What can I
do you for, Orval?</i>

been doing some talking,

and, uh...
you've had a good run.

Well, 15 years.

You're a legend.

<i>You're in Parade Magazine.</i>

You're the Elvis of butter.

But we just kinda feel
like it's time...

...you gave
somebody else a shot.

Uh-huh.

We're prepared to offer
you a spot at State.

Um... you could be a judge.

With me and Mary Alice
and Carl Hudgens.

Carl Hudgens is a good guy.
He's a great guy.

It's time to start giving back.

You know, like Oprah does.

Yeah, well, she's got
that Angel Network.

I just have one
sort of delicate question.

Laura?
Laura.

[Laura laughing] You know,
I really think that Bob

could be an excellent mayor.

or even, or even governor.


...she's very, uh... involved.

Oh, she's fine.
She'll be fine.

Laura... [clearing throat]

[crashing, glass shattering]

These fuckers have no idea
who they're dealing with.

We're the motherfucking
Picklers.

Clearly Orval wanted you
out of the way.

I have always known
what kind of man he was.

I never thought
he'd go this far.

You know Orval is a good man.

He has had it out for us
from day one, Bob.

I will call the governor.

That's what I'll do.
I'll call the governor.

Or Jesus. I mean, don't you
have his direct line?

My constitutional rights are being
violated and I will call the governor.

The governor
doesn't care, Laura.

[dialing telephone]

What did you say?

The governor doesn't care.

Whose side are you on, Bob?

It's time to pass
the baton, Laura.

I need to start giving back.

Like Oprah.

How dare you
bring Oprah into this?

Kaitlen, sweetie.

Could you please provide your
father and me with some privacy?

She can stay.

Cover your balls, Dad.

I see what happened here, Bob.

You didn't stand up
for yourself, did you?

That's what happened here.

I think it'd show a real touch
of class if we stepped down now.

I guess Dad was right when he
warned me against marrying someone

whose biggest dream was to be
the middle school principal.

What's that supposed to mean?
It just means maybe I should've taken his advice

and married Boyd Bolton.
Boyd Bolton?

At least he inherited a
successful car dealership.

I am done.

I doubt Boyd would just give up Bolton
Supercenter at the drop of a hat, Bob.

Laura, please.

You get back here, Bob.

If you won't stand up to them,
then I will!

[car starts]

Fucking freaks.

[tires screech]

<i>I gotta ask you, you just turned
down over a half a million dollars.</i>

I told her not to pick 22.

[TV continues, indistinct]

[car approaching]

[car horn honking]

[car door closes]
Oh, shit! Tell her I'm not here.

What? Who? What's going on?

Laura. Laura Pickler.
Oh, God. Here?

Tell her I'm fishing.
At night?

Oh, God! Why is she here?

[Laura pounds on door] Orval!
What if she gets inside?

Orval!
Can you hear me?

I hear you!

<i>- [man on TV] One is worth $200,000.
[woman] Yeah.</i>

<i>- [man] One case is worth one million.
[jingling on TV]</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

Laura.

How nice to see you.

Where's Orval?

He's in the shower.

Maybe I can have him
call you later.

I'll wait.

If you ask me,
number 24 is too thin.

[door opens, closes]
Oh, I see how it is.

He wants to play a game, does he?

Well, you tell
Orval this isn't over.

I'd get a good night's sleep.

Because County is in a month
and we got a lot of work to do.

Laura, it's over. I'm not entering County.
Orval and I agreed.

We gotta get the butter,
we gotta sharpen the trowels.

We gotta check the cooling unit because the
temperature thing's been all fucked up for ages.

We gotta...
Listen to me. I'm not competing this year.

I know.

I am.
What?

I'm competing.

I'll win County.

And after that I will bring back
what is rightfully ours.

And you're gonna help me.

Committee has turned on your father

like Judas Iscariot himself.

The good news is that,
instead of your father

I will be competing this year.

I think we should be proud of your mother.
Stepmother.

And have you ever made a butter
sculpture before?

You don't even eat dairy.

Oh, man, you are
gonna suck so hard.

Kaitlen.
I guess I expected outsiders to be skeptical,

but my own family?

I have stood by your father
for the past 15 years.

Watching, learning, absorbing.

I was there when he turned 867 sticks
of butter into First Lady Laura Bush.

I was there when,
two days before State,

the cooler broke and his Iwo Jima
just turned into a river of yellow.

And I am here now
in his darkest hour of need

to lift him up
and preserve our legacy.

Bird or door, Bob.
Pick one. Let's go.

Hey, boo!
You can't be here.

Oh, but you still owe
me money, remember?

I never got the rest
of the money.

That shit ain't free.

This isn't happening.

But you said you loved me, Bob.

That was a little early for me.

But we did it. I never do it
with guys from the club, Bob.

Dad? Who's that?

Nobody.

[clears throat]
[Brooke] Nobody?!

[Kaitlen] Is she a hooker?
[Bob] No, no.

I like her boots.
Those are Army boots.

She's a recruiter.

Wait a minute.
Is she your hooker?

Because I totally understand if she is.
Kaitlen.

Go back to the table right now.

Nobody? Nobody?! Bob!

Brooke! Can't we
do this over email?

Bob, I'm gonna shit
on the hood of your car.

I see. You are definitely
a passionate woman.

You have two minutes to get me
that money or I swear to God.

I'm sorry, Brooke, I can't.
I'm married.

You know what? Fuck you!
You are just like my father.

Your wife, Bob?

I can't believe you're gonna
let your wife come between us.

I thought you had morals.
OK.

You tell your wife
to watch her back.


Fuck you, Bob!

No, thank you.
We have plenty of steak knives.



You owe me, Bob.

You owe me big.

[knocking on door]
[Jill] Can I come in?

Sure.

So how was your first day?
Good.

Ethan said you were interested in
doing that butter contest thing?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

It's kind of redneck-y.

I don't mind.

Looks like you've
been practicing.

Who's that?

That's my real dad.
And this is my mom.

And this must be you.

Don't you look all happy.

No. That's my sister.

So where are you?

Well, I'm here.

Don't worry. My real mom
will come get me soon.

OK.

She's fine.

Great.

Laura, I thought Bob was
judging State this year.

He is.
I'm signing up for myself.


Are you sure?

You have big shoes to fill,
following your husband like that.

Well, don't worry, I'm not a
feminist or anything like that.

I just worry about what would
happen if this title

and all the power that
goes with it ends up

in the hands of someone
other than a Pickler.

I mean, we all know what happened
with the Miss America Pageant

and Vanessa Williams.

Well, I guess I see your point.

I see I'm the only name here in Johnson County.
What time do we wrap this up?

Official rules state
we need to be here until noon.

I'll wait.

Good.

Do you want me to go in
with you?

Don't tell Jill,

because she always likes me
to think positive.

but what I like to do is this.

I imagine all the bad things

that could possibly happen
if you enter this contest.

Like you could die
of a tragic butter overdose.

There could be a rabid grizzly bear
hiding inside this very moose lodge,

waiting to tear your face off.

There could be a python inside.

What if this place is full
of monkeys with a deadly virus?

There could be
the ghost of Hitler.

What if there's no gravity in there?
And you float up

and bang your head on the ceiling.
And then all of a sudden,

gravity kicks in and then you
bang your head on the floor?

There could be a black hole and it'd suck me all up.
Yes.

What if this place is full of
good-looking British vampires?

The worst of all of them.
They're so pale.

Or hungry cannibals.
It could happen.

Or there could be a mass murderer who
only kills adorable little girls.

Think about it.
Or racist ninjas.

Or racist ninjas, yes.
High five.

That was a good one.

So think about all that

and ask yourself, really,

what's the worst thing
that could happen?

I could be terrible and lose.

Yeah.

Yeah, could you live with that?

I guess so.

OK then. So it's not
such a big deal, is it?

Go make us proud.

Bring me back some butter.

Adorable.


Laura?

Oh, my God!

Are you entering, too?

Oh, my God!

We have to get coolers right
next to each other!

It'll be just like camp!

How fun.

I'm really nervous.

I mean, what am I doing, right?
But I just said to myself,

"Carol Ann, you've been sitting
in the audience for too long.

Now's your time to get up on
that stage and sing!"

I'm so glad you're here.

We're gonna be
just like sisters.

Oh, no offense.

I'd like to sign up, please.

Oh, isn't that just precious.


[door opens]
Looks like it'll be the three of us.

Is someone smoking?

Fuck this bullshit.

Hey.

Can I help you?

Yeah.

I want to... sign up.

For the Johnson County Mastery
in Butter Sculpture Competition?

Oh, man.

Yeah. That. I want
to sign up for that.

I'm gonna cut you.

Have you worked
with butter before?

Oh, I've worked with it all.

I object.
Uh...

You know, she is here on time

and the rules do state
that anyone can enter.

Look at what she's wearing.

This will go over very badly
with the Red Ribbon people.

Well, I don't see anything
in here about that. I really...

Ah!

Your husband still owes me
another $600.

Interesting. Did he buy
600 blowjobs on credit?

Look, lady, you came
in between me and my man.

Sh! We're in a Moose Lodge.

Bob is my husband.

We have built a life together.

Once Kaitlen leaves, I plan on
proudly bearing his children.

So? You want a cookie 'cause
you're gonna get pregnant?

I get pregnant
like once a month.

Do you honestly think
you're anything more

than a cheap lay to him?
He'll get bored.

After that he'll come right back
where he belongs,

to my house.

Listen...

Would you prefer it
if I didn't enter

this whole
butter contest thing?

Absolutely.

Excellent.

It's on, cunt.

I haven't heard that word
since my dad died.

it would work out, but...

And finally, State Head Judge

Carol Ann Stevenson?

That's mine.

I just really love kittens.

Especially when they get tangled
up in a blanket,

but I didn't know how to carve that,
so I just put them in a basket.

I hope that's OK.

Thank you!

Thank you, Carol Ann.
Uh, Brooke?

Many of you know that I am
a former stripper...

...often taking my job
a step further

and engaging in
sexual acts for money.

[crowd gasps]
I went from man to man to man,

always looking,
always searching.

Then one day,

after I was nearly
beaten to death by a customer...

[crowd gasps]
...I stumbled into another house.

A big welcoming house.

And met another man.

And that man was Jesus Christ.

[crowd applauds]

I present to you,
"The Scarlet Letter."

For those of you who don't know,
it's a movie starring Demi Moore.

Thank you and God bless you.

[woman] Thank you, Brooke...
Six hundred dollars.

I don't have it.
...for the inspiration.

Um, OK. Destiny?

Hi. My name is Destiny.

My last name is either
Washington or Wilson.

The reason I'm not sure is because
the State of Iowa isn't sure.

You see, I am,
and have been, a foster child.

I've been shuttled
from home to home.

While some of my experiences
have been negative,

most of them have been
overwhelmingly positive.

So why then, can a
ten-year-old black girl

with no family, no money
and no connections

stand before you today and believe
that she can win this competition?

Why did the Pilgrims
dare to cross

the vast, dark oceans
to America?

Why did they risk it?

And why did a man
named Abraham Lincoln

move from a log cabin
to the... No, wait.

Move from a log house
to the White House

and risk both houses to keep
this great nation together?

The same reason a poor black
woman risked life and limb,

partnering with white
and black people alike

to bring my ancestors to freedom
on the Underground Railroad.

Why?

Because she dared to dream.

And that's kinda what
I'm doing here today.

[cheers, applause]

Thank you very much.

How'd you do that?


That's a hard act to follow.

Oh, um...

Last, but, uh, certainly
not least, Laura Pickler!

Laura, come on up.

Family.

When... when I think
about butter

I think about family.

[clears throat] Why?

Because like the thread
of a grandmother's quilt,

butter is the centerpiece
of a family dinner.

And family, in turn,

is the thread that holds our
great country together.

Without butter,
there is no family,

and without family,
there is no...



This is really hard.

your time, dear.

Um...

I'd like to remind you
what this contest is about.

It is about
"excellence in butter."

I have spent my life
working hard,

trying to do the right thing.

Because I thought that's what
this competition was about.

I just hope when you vote,
you remember that.

Thank you.
God bless America.

God bless you.

Thank you, all four of you.

How'd I do?

You carved two more people
than anyone else.

We now have coffee and donut
holes in the back for everyone

while the judges deliberate.

Donut holes!


If I may have your attention.

We have a decision.

In fourth place,
Carol Ann Stevenson.

Come on, come on!

Congrats, Carol Ann.

Uh, and in third place,
Brooke Swinkowski.

What?!

Hey, I know you're only, like,
ten and shit, but listen up.

You beat that skanky ass bitch.

You beat her hard. I've done all I can do.
It's up to you now.

OK.

You're a good girl.

I don't think I want you hanging
out with strippers, OK?

OK, if I may have
your attention.

Um, will Laura Pickler

and Destiny please come up?

Representing Johnson County
in the Iowa State Fair.

Mastery in Butter Competition
this year will be...

...Destiny!

<i>[Destiny] I guess it was wrong of me to
say that all white people are weird.</i>

<i>That's not true at all.</i>

<i>Actually, white people
are really awesome!</i>

Screw that little Afro girl.

Dad!
Kaitlen, your mother is upset.

What is it, African-Iowan?
It's not my responsibility

to keep up with whatever it is they're
calling themselves these days.

What?
She knew she was good all along.

All along, she hustled us.
She's a hustler.

What is your problem? It's just
some stupid contest. God.

I cannot wait to get away
from this stupid family.

Really?

Maybe I'll just be a stripper,
like Dad's new friend.

[muffled conversation]

<i>[Laura] Stupid Laura. You know
what you should've said?</i>

<i>This is exactly why I stopped
watching American Idol.</i>

Because every year the best
singer gets up there,

and every year she gets knocked
down by some charity case

<i>with a baby and a mug shot.</i>

Well, I'm sorry that I was born
white and tall and pretty.

And I'm sorry that I don't sit
in front of the TV all day,

eating pork rinds
and just soiling myself.

And I'm sorry that I haven't spent
the last 15 years of my life

sucking every cock that flew in front of my
face just to put on a cheap church dress

and claim to find God.


I hate my fucking life.

Language.

To Destiny!

To Destiny!
To me!

It's been a long time.

Bob wrecked our minivan.

Oh, yeah, I see that.
Wow. What did he do?

He slammed into something he
shouldn't have slammed into.

Well, if you want, we can...

...we can have it fixed for you
right away.

That would be excellent.

[woman on PA, indistinct]

You look great, Laura.
Oh.

You look even better than you
did in high school.

No.
Yeah. Most women go the other way, but... Oh, my God.

Have you had your boobs done?
They're just cutlets in a friendly bra.

Oh, my God.

How's your wife?

She's fine, I guess.
Great.

[woman on TV] Brent and Tammy
Knepp of Rancho Bernardo

were about to give up
on swaddling their son.

Look at this shit.

It keeps babies
from punching themselves.

And don't you think it's weird
that babies can't sleep

without smacking
themselves in the face?

I mean, think about how
fucked up that is.

It's like you shouldn't
be able to exist or something

if you can't sleep without your arms
flailing around all over the place.

I mean, think about it. Is a baby
better off dead or in the suburbs?

In the suburbs you are forced
to live with some stupid family,

with stupid people that call you fat
even when you are not fat at all.

and you're forced to deal with
stupid guys like Rob Ackerman,

who don't call you back even
when you give them a blowjob

in the back of their Honda.

God, I hate people!

I cannot wait until everyone
just dies from global warming.

[clears throat] Right. Do you know
where your dad keeps his money?

Why?

Does he owe you money?

Like for sex?

He just owes me money.

Your hair is so cool.

No one at my school
has hair like that.

Thanks. So, the cash would
probably in the...

I've never met anyone

You're so alternative.

I'm sorry, I can't do this.
No, no, no, I can get you the $600.

Actually, it's $1200.

OK. You are so beautiful.

Hmm.

OK, so just so you know, I'm
the one that lives in Iowa City.


I don't think there's any other Boyd
Boltons that live in Iowa City,

but if there is, I'm the one
who runs Bolton Supercenter.

Yeah, anyway...

...I just wanted to take this
moment to thank you

for sending Laura Pickler
to fuck me.

I mean, I don't know what you
guys are doing up there,

but her pussy is like even tighter
than it was in high school.

It's... it's like she hasn't
even used it in 20 years.

Anyway...

...thank you.

You're so cool, God.

Amen.

[telephone ringing]

Hello?

Oh, hi, Nancy.

What?!

Well, what could possibly be the
problem? She's ten years old.

Right, all right.

See you then. Good-bye.

I'm scared.

Why are you scared?
You're amazing.

Really, it's them that
should be scared.

No, I'm scared that you and
Miss Jill won't want me anymore.

What?!

It's happened before.

They just leave me.


Did you know that
Jill can't have kids?

Why?

Well, I mean,
that's complicated.

It's...

Is her vagina broken?
Yes.

Yep. That's it.

The adoption people would ask
us over and over again...

"Are you sure you
don't want a baby?

We can get you a baby.

You both have good jobs.

You have a nice house.

We can get you a baby."

But we made up this whole thing
in our heads that, like,

we wanted an older child because
they're always overlooked

and we'd be doing so much good for
society and the world and everything.

But the truth is,
we were afraid to have a baby.

Why?

I don't know.

It's OK to be scared, I guess.
[door opens]

they're ready for us now.

Destiny, um, come in.

What's going on?

This is Martin Caswell
from Red Ribbon.

[door closes]
[intercom beeps]

send in Mr. Bolton.


Oh. [Chuckling]

Boyd, would you tell these people,
please, what you told me? Exactly?


On the evening of the 15th,
Mr. Ethan approached me,

knowing I have superior skills
in the art of sculpting butter.

And asked if I would help
his daughter, Destiny,

with her sculpture...

...with her entry for the Johnson
County Mastery in Butter contest.

I'm sorry, what?

I said no at first.

But after he gave me $500...
You're kidding!

...I snuck in when
no one was looking

and I... I carved
her sculpture for her.

I can no longer live
with this horrible blight...

...on, on, on, on, on...

...on my conscience.

This is crazy, OK?

I have never met this dude
in my life, I swear to God.

Come on, you people saw her
carve it with your own eyes.

I can't even believe
I'm arguing this.

May I make a suggestion?

As it's clear that Destiny's win
is in question, I...

Absolutely not.

Destiny won this on her own,
fair and square.

I think the only fair solution
would be to have a rematch.

Me versus Destiny.

At the State Fair.

Um, State is this weekend.

I mean, I can't possibly get the
proper paperwork prepared in time.

I'm sure someone as smart as you
can figure it out, Nancy.

But the coolers.

And then we'd have to haul all
the butter in two days before

so it'll set and...
Excellent. Great.

Well, now that Nancy has
agreed to do her... her job

looks like we've got a rematch.

What's wrong with you people?

I can't believe you just let this
two-bit trophy wife come in here...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now wait a second.

Hey, hey, hey.
[overlapping chatter]

I know.
She's crazy.

This is the kind
of thing that I just...

Who are you?
I'll do it.

...from over here.

I'll do it.
Destiny.

Eight-hour carve time,
all out in the open,

officials present every minute.

No verbal contact
with the audience.

No help.

And no speeches.

Just butter.

Deal?
Deal.

Can you believe that bitch?

Jill.

Sorry. You know you
can't say "bitch" right?

I know.
Just her whole thing.

The hair, the dress, that grin.

Destiny, it's not too late to go back in there
and tell them you don't wanna do this thing.

Are you kidding me? Destiny is gonna
nail that witch. Aren't you, Destiny?

You better believe it.

All right.

Let's prep.

Laura.

Laura!

Obviously, I wish you had better
reading skills, but all in all...

She's only ten!

Thank you for your help, Boyd.


That's it?

Hey, hey, where are you going?

Come on, don't you remember us?
We were Boyd and Laura.

[sighs] I give up.
Boyd.

[marching band playing]


Imagine if we got
an apartment together.

We could move to Des Moines.

You got the $1200 right?

Or maybe Chicago.

Can you imagine how humiliated
my stepmom would be?

She'd probably like, explode.

I think you're late
for practice.

I could be with you forever.

Yeah.

About that. The money?
Oh.

I can't wait to see
how this plays out.

Good luck.

Call me.

Yeah, definitely will.

I was only kidding about
the moving in together stuff.

Move it, bitches!

[band halts abruptly]

[Brooke] Whoo!
[school bell rings]

[children chattering]

Hey, girl.
Hi.

Let's go for a ride.
I got something to show you.

OK.

What'd you learn
in school today?

Positive and negative numbers.

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

over there?

Mm-hm.

With this $1200
I could buy work clothes

like you have never seen.

Where do you work?

Barnes & Noble.

So I want you
to look over there.

And I want you to see very clearly
that I am willing to sacrifice $1200

worth of totally cute outfits so
that you can have these knives.

And with these knives,
you carve the best damn

butter sculpture this
world has ever seen.

You must not fail, Destiny.

You can do this.
You can take down Laura Pickler.

You kick her pasty,
white ass so hard,

so that she and her stupid
husband can never wreak havoc

on poor, innocent people
like me ever again.

We cool?

Thank you.

[up-tempo music]

nine times out of ten in these cases,

we suspect drugs and...

Hey.
Hi, honey.


You know...

..I think it would be best if we had
this discussion alone, just grownups.

Uh... No, no, she can stay.

OK.

From what we can surmise, on the night of...
Um...

Destiny, your mother
was a wonderful woman

who fell on hard times.

She was not capable
of taking care of you,

but she loved you
very much nonetheless.

We found this.

She's pretty.

Hi, Mom. It's me,
Destiny. Your daughter.

We probably haven't seen each
other since I was a baby.

I don't remember you at all.

But now that the lady gave me
your picture, I wish I did.

I don't know what you were
doing all these years,

but now that
you've gone to heaven

I just want you to know
I forgive you for leaving me.

I don't really understand it that
much, but I still forgive you.

OK. Bye.

[breathing deeply]


[pounding on door]
[gasping] Motherfucker!

Hi, Bob.

Come on. Come on in, just
standing there like Rain Man.

Hey.

Um... I don't think
this is gonna work.

Laura, you're gonna need an
armature for something that grand.

Then I'll build an armature.

I'm not afraid
of hard work, Bob.

Not that it matters
anymore anyway.

What do you mean?

Well, you saw
what I did back there.

My sculpture was twice as good as your
"Schindler's List" and you know it.

My cooler was 43 degrees, the
eye-forehead-ratio was perfect.

Yeah. You had all that down.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kinda
surprised at how technically good you are.

You think, Bob?
Yeah.

But you also need
to inject some soul into it.

I'm just saying...

...not everyone can be
an artist.

You don't think
I can be an artist?

Look, I know what it is
I'm dealing with here.

I am gonna have to give
these so-called judges

the statement piece
that they're looking for.

And when they see what I have planned for
them, their jaws are gonna hit the floor.

And you are gonna
be right there,

next to my cooler,

cheering me on as dutifully
as I have you the last 15 years.

What happened?

Um, we don't know.

But she's gonna get a chance
to fix it, right?

Well, um, the judges have
already begun deliberation.

And the rules indicate that no
further adjustment can be made

once deliberation commences.

Come on, lady.

My name is Nancy
and those are the rules.

You know what?

You people are ridiculous.

I mean, it's butter.

You put it on toast.

Right? The government
gives it away for free.

Oh, oh, oh! And newsflash!

It's bad for you!

Yeah, I said it out loud.

It clogs your arteries
and it makes you fat.

And you're all gonna
die because of it!

What?
Really?

The butter police? Wow!

We've got it. We've got it under
control. We've got it.

Destiny, we'll be right back.

So now what?

I've lost, that's what.

attention, please?

The judges have reached
a decision. Orval?

Thank you, Nancy. Um...

In my years judging
this competition, uh,

I've seen many things.

But only twice
have I seen true art.

The first was Bob Pickler's
brilliant "Passion of The Christ"

with Neil Diamond as Jesus.

And the second this morning...
Did he say Neil Diamond?

...when I laid eyes on a work
so tragic, so touching,

that it became not just butter
carving, but butter art.

And to be touched yourself, you
merely have to look right here...

...at the sad, melted face

of this unloved child.

Our winner, again, is Destiny.

Can you put me down, please?

I'd just like to say

this isn't all you have.

that year.</i>
