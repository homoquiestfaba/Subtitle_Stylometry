             [  %%  ]              

     Ah, listen to this.        

         According to           
     the welcome wagon,         

        Miller falls has        
         a population of        

 Four thousand, one hundred     
     and eighty-six people.     

         Welcome wagon?         

         They still have        
     welcome wagons here?       

     Well, you're in Ohio.      

            I can see           
     the headlines now,         

     "newcomers run over        
     by welcome wagon."         

         Where are we?          

 Honey, you can't find your     
    way around unless you're    
     willing to explore.        

     Aw, honey...Please         
     don't get us lost.         

     Our first day in town's     
     not the time to play       
        Lewis and Clark.        

     Okay. Slow down. It's      
        up on the right.        

     Oop. Let me guess.         
         The blue one.          

             Nice.              

        Nope, nope, nope,       
         it's the brick.        

             Well?              

         Who owned this,        
         Rockefeller?           

            Charley?            

             What?              

     How do you like it?        

     I'd like it better if      
     it was our old house       
         in Denver.             

        No, you wouldn't.       

     Our old house in Denver    
 is full of the Andersons...    
        All ten of them.        

     I don't even know why      
     we're here at all!         

     Sweetheart, we talked      
         about this.            

    No, you talked about it!    
     No one ever asked me!      

     This, too, shall pass.     

         I like it.             

     Hey, it's four-thirty.     
    Who's hungry? You hungry?   

         I could eat.           

     You could eat. Does        
    that mean you know how to   
     eat or you want to eat?    

         If it's pizza.         

    Ah, we have a consensus.    

     Honey! Dinner! Come on!    

     Ho, that was great.        

     I'm liking this town       
         more and more.         

        They didn't even        
         have pepperoni.        

     Well, that's 'cause        
 it's a seafood restaurant.     

            Honey...            

         Dad, look out!         

        Stop, Ben! You're       
        gonna...Hit him!        

     [ squealing tires. ]       

            [ yelp. ]           

         Is he dead?            

         Uh...No, he's          
        still breathing.        

         How bad is it?         

         I don't know.          
         There could be         
     internal injuries.         

     What should we do?         

     Well, we gotta get         
     this guy to a vet.         

        Is he gonna die?        

     No...Charley, he's         
        not going to die.       

    Come on, get in the car.    

     Man, next time you         
     decide to play chicken,    

         Do it with a           
     scooter, not an SUV.       

         Here he comes.         

         Well, I've done        
         what I can.            

     Internal injuries?         

        Well, I-I...I was       
     afraid the bladder         
     might be ruptured,         

         Which would            
         be very bad.           

    The animal could develop    
         peritonitis...         

     Go into shock and die.     

     Fortunately...That         
     wasn't the case...Here.    

         Excuse me.             

    The kidneys are bruised.    
     Uh, some of the muscles    
        have been pulled.       

     I don't uh, I don't        
         know about uh,         
     all the organs yet.        

         So he'll live?         

            Yeah, I--           

         Bless you!             

         Aw, thank you.         
         I think so.            

         I have to run a        
     couple more tests.         

     You know, the foreleg      
     seems to be bothering      

        Her quite a bit,        
     but it's not broken.       

             Her?               

     Yeah, it's a...Female.     
        What's her name?        

     She's not our dog.         

        Oh. Stray. Yeah,        
     I....Thought that might    

        Be the case when        
     I didn't see a collar.     

         Okay, uh...            

        ...You want to be       
     responsible for her?       

    Otherwise, they're going    
    to send her to the county   

 And, in most cases, injured    
     strays are euthanized.     

        Well, uh...Yeah,        
         I guess so.            

         Can I see her?         

         No, buddy she's        
     just been sedated.         

        Um, maybe another       
     time would be better.      

     Uh, it's okay. We don't    
        need to see her.        

        Where will she go       
     after she wakes up?        

        Not with us, pal.       

            Why not?            

     Sweetheart, remember       
     our lease agreement.       

     We can't have pets.        

         Well, she could        
         stay here...           

         Bless you!             

        I have a cold the       
     size of Mount McKinley.    

     You know, you don't        
        have to do this.        

     Euthanasia...Might be      
    the most merciful thing.    

        No. I don't want        
        to do that, okay.       

         Okay. Great.           

     Listen, just give me       
     your name and your         

     Phone number, and I'll     
        contact you about       

     The boarding fees.         

 This dog has good breeding.    

             Really?            

     Yeah, I'll-I'll...Bet      
     she's AKC registered.      

         What's AKC?            

     American kennel club.      
        It means she's a        

     Really special dog.        

     I'm indebted to you,       
         Dr. Elliot.            

     Thank you very much.       
        And call me doc.        

 Most people around here do.    

        Don't worry, I'll       
     give you a good rate.      

         Thanks, doc.           

         What? It was an        
            accident.           

        I didn't know she       
     was a thoroughbred.        

         That would be          
     horses, sweetheart.        

     Horses, dogs, whatever.    

        Did you say your        
     prayers, sweetheart?       

             No!                

            Not you.            

             Yes.               

             Mom?               

             Mm-hm?             

     What does "youth and       
         um, Asia" mean?        

     Euthanasia is when they    
     put an animal to sleep.    

     You mean, kill her?        

     Well, sometimes...It's     

     Better to do that than     
        to let it suffer.       

     But you can't do that!     

     Well...Your dad's not      
     gonna let that happen.     

            (to Ben)            
     are you, sweetheart?       

         Nothing's gonna        
         happen to her.         

        Now go to sleep.        

         Dad...I really         
        want to keep her.       

     We can't keep her. No      
     pets allowed here.         

             Mom?               

     We'll go to the vet        
     tomorrow and make sure     

     She's all right, okay?     

             Okay.              

         He should put          
        us all to sleep.        

        And the good news       
         is, none of her        

 Injuries were life threatening.

     Well, that's a relief,     
     isn't it, charley?         

             Yeah.              

         Thank you, doc.        

         You're welcome.        

        So, when will she       
     be able to be let go?      

             Never.             

             Never?             

     Yeah, you know...I         
    noticed that her foreleg    

        Was bothering her       
     when I-when I examined     

     Her and it is, but         
     it has nothing to do       
     with the accident.         

         What is it?            

             Cancer.            

     Can't you stop it?         

     Yeah, charley, I can.      
 Unfortunately, there's only    

     Really one way that        
         I can do that.         

 You mean, amputate her leg?    

        Yeah. Do you want       
     to go to that expense?     

     How far advanced is it?    

     Well, I will tell you      
     that it is a Miracle       

         That it hasn't         
    metastasized before now.    

 This is...One special dog.     

     But if you want to         
     save her, it's gonna       

     Have to happen soon.       

             Mom?               

    Aw, sweetheart I wish we    
        could adopt her,        

 I really do. But we can't.     

         But we can pay         
     for the operation.         

     I think you've made        
        the right choice.       

        Oh, have I? Now,        
     who's gonna adopt a        

        Three-legged dog?       

 Oh, I don't know. How 'bout a  

     Two-legged boy who         
         needs a friend?        

         That's right.          

     You sure? No charge?       

 Not if you give her a home.    

             Oh.                

     I'll see what I can do.    

        Okay charley, you       
     can have a couple more     

        Minutes with her.       

         (to Dr. Elliot)        
     doc, thanks a lot.         

         You're welcome.        

             Thanks.            

     You...Are very welcome.    

     You know, son, I wonder    
 what happened to her puppies.  

         What puppies?          

 Oh, I noticed that last night. 

 She uh, she must have just     
 finished weaning a litter.     

         Really? Where?         

     I don't know. Maybe        
     where you found her.       

         You think so?          

     Seems like a pretty        
     good place to start.       

 You're not sneezing today.     

     You know, that's true.     

    It's the strangest thing,   
     I-I'm not sick anymore.    

     You brush your teeth?      

             Twice.             

     Want to take a ride        
    around the neighborhood?    

         What for? I            
     don't know anybody.        

     Well, if you stay home,    
     you won't meet anybody.    

     I-I just don't want to.    

            Charley-            

     And what-what if they      
 don't want to play with me?    

     But what if they do?       

         What do I say?         

        You say, "hello.        
     Hi, my name's charley".    

         Um, when will          
     our stuff be here?         

    'bout four days. Listen,    
         sweetheart,            

        We're all in the        
     same boat. Your dad,       

         You, me, we're         
     all gonna get used to      

     It. We're all gonna        
        make new friends.       

     Yeah, easy for you         
     to say. You have a job.    

        I've got my cell        
     phone with me. You can     

        Call me every two       
     hours. And I love you.     

        I love you, too.        

        Keep your helmet        
     on. Don't you take it      

         Off when you're        
        out of my sight.        

        I won't. Ha! Ha!

         Coming through!        

        I've prepped her.       
     I've called radiology.     

 I believe she's in stabilized  
         condition, sir.        

         Okay, I want a         
    full set of x rays, fore    

        And aft, anterior       
     and posterior knee,        

 And uh, all quadrants, okay?   

 Do we need to check for any    
 internal injuries, doctor?     

        No, no, no, just        
            the knee.           

     Allright? I'll get         
        everything ready.       

     And one other thing.       
     It's very important.       

        Get me the score        
     of the browns game.        

 Oh, I already checked that.    
 They're up by a touchdown.     

         Well, my day's         
     looking better already.    

         Sorry I'm late.        

     Or maybe not. You're       
        too late, Malone.       

             I am?              

         No, she's going        
        to be all right.        

     Cuts and abrasions and     
    a shattered left kneecap.   

     All in all, I'd say        
 she's a pretty lucky lady.     

 They flew her on life flight   
 just for a shattered kneecap?  

     This is Kelly Maguire,     
         one of the top         

    Ten tennis players in the   
    world. They want the best   
     orthopedic surgeon         

         In the country.        
        Which reminds me.       

 You know, you've got wonderful 
 instincts as a resident, and...

 ...I think you're going to     
 be a really good doctor...     

     ...But you've gotta        
     stop forgetting the        

     Fundamentals! I mean,      
         when you're on         

     Duty, you've gotta         
     remain in the area!        

 I don't want to have to call   
 my residents more than once!   

     I know, I'm sorry.         
     When I got the page-       

     Sorry doesn't cut it!      

            Yes, sir.           

     There's another thing      
     you've gotta learn.        

     The art of diplomacy.      

             I do?              

 Yes. Dr. Kay and I want you to 
 go and greet our new medical   
         researcher.            

 His name is Ben Logan. And     
     I don't want him to        

         Feel like he's         
         been forgotten.        

     I've actually read         
     some of his research       

         That he did for        
     uh, Boston children's.     

         That's the guy.        

             Okay.              

     Now, go. And remember!     

         Fundamentals.          

         Right, right.          

         Dr. Logan.             

             Yes?               

     Andy Malone. Welcome       
         to the clinic.         

         Thanks. Good to        
     be here. Resident?         

     Ah, yes, actually.         
         Six months next        

        Week. I've heard        
     quite a bit about you.     

            All lies.           

     Right, right, right.       
    I actually read the paper   

 You presented to the Boston    
     children's clinic.         

 "minimal invasive thoracic     
     surgery techniques for     
         newborns."             

     It's pretty impressive.    

         Thank you.             

        Yeah. You're here       
     on a research Grant,       
        is that correct?        

     Yeah, convalescent and     
        rehab strategies.       

     Yeah, what disciplines?    

     Pretty much everything     
         from oncology          
        to brain surgery.       

     Sounds like you've         
         got the run            
        of the hospital.        

 Well, yeah. Any patient that's 
in rehab or convalescing is fair
             game.              

     Actually, this is me,      
        but uh, it was a        
     pleasure to meet you.      

     If you need anything,      
     please just holler.        

    Well, thank you. I will.    

         Dr. Logan.             

            Uh, yeah.           

         Oh, Dr. Kay!           

     Hi, good to see you.       

         You, too, sir.         

     How's everything going?    

     Just fine, thank you.      

     Listen, let me know        
     if there's anything        
        I can do for you.       

         Yes, sir, I            
        will. Thank you.        

         Good morning.          

         Hey, Leeza.            

        Is she here yet?        

             Yes.               

             Hi.                

Hi.

     Cleveland clinic. I'm

             Thanks.            

         You're welcome.        

    Guess I have to get up to   
 speed on the routine here.     

         Oh, you will.          

    Your husband's here on a    
     research Grant, right?     

     Yeah. He took the Grant    
    so we could be together.    

     Okay, stay in front        
         of the ball.           

        Keep in front of        
         the ball. Oww!

     You charley Logan?         

         Um ... Maybe.          

        Your mom asked me       
     to give you this note.     

             Okay.              

     Do you know where this     
     um, waiting room is?

        out the elevator,       

     Hang a left, about         
     halfway down the hall.     

            You lost?           

Hi.                             

                             Hi.

             No.                

     Maybe. Maybe, yeah.        

 I'm gonna take that as a yes.  

        My mom said there       
     was an empty waiting       
     room on this floor.        

     Yeah, who's your mom?      

         Terry Logan?           

        Ah, the assistant       
         administrator.         

     That means your dad        
        is Dr. Ben Logan.       

        How did you know?       

     I'm gifted that way.       

     Are there patients         
         on this floor?         

 Yeah. This is actually, the    
 geriatric convalescent ward.   

         Old people.            

             Oh.                

         Dr. Malone?            

 Andy. You can call me Andy.    

     Hi, Andy. I'm charley.     

        Hi, charley. It's       
        good to meet you.       

        Well, charley, I        
     have afternoon rounds.     

         I'm gonna leave        
         you here, okay?        

         All right.             

     You gonna be good?         

             Yeah.              

            Promise?            

             Mm-hm.             

        All right. Later.       

         Mrs. Mannion?          

         Who are you?           

         Dr. Logan.             

         Where's Nate?          

             Nate?              

 Nate Ecklin, my physician.     

        Dr. Ecklin's out        
         of town today.         

     They asked me to stop      
    in and see you. I'm new.    

 Well, I'm old, and I don't     
    want a different doctor.    

         Well, I'm not.         

        I mean, I am, but       
     I'm not here to take       

     Dr. Ecklin's place. I-I    
        just need to ask        

     You a few questions        
     about your treatments.     

    What are you doing here?    

     I'm doing research.        

     But you can't just         
     barge in like this.        

     Well actually, you         
     can go anywhere you        

         Want as long as        
        you look serious        
     and carry a clipboard.     

     Um, you're leaving.        

     Yes, as soon as Edward     
     comes with the car.        

     You're scheduled for       
     chemotherapy tomorrow.     

     Well, they can schedule    
     whatever they like.        

     I'm going home. And you    
     can't make me stay.        

    My money built this wing.   

     Well, I'm not going        
        to make you stay,       

     Mrs. Mannion, but I        
     suggest you reconsider.    

 Because without the therapy,   
 your cancer will return again. 

     Dr. Logan ... I am         
        tired. I'm alone.       

     Albert and I had only      
         one daughter.          

    She died a few years ago.   

     So I want to go home.      

     Sorry. Home, madam?        

     Where else would I go?     

         That went well.        

         [ phone rings ]

 New town kind of a bummer?     

         It's okay.             

         Want a ride?           

     No, I've got my bike.      

     Look, charley, I-I         
     know this has been         

        Kind of tough on        
     you. I mean, you made      

     The bigger sacrifice       
        coming here, and        

     Your mom and I both        
        know you'd really       

     Like to keep that dog.     

             Annie.             

     Annie, right. Look,        
     as-as soon as I can        

         Get my research        
         going and this         

    Teleconference finished,    
         I'll find us a         

         Real house, one        
    where we can have a dog.    

         Well, what if          
         we're too late?        

 Well, we'll tell doc Elliot    
 we want to keep her, okay?

         She's my best

     You got a dog in here?     

        Her name's Annie.       

        This is your dog?       

     Well, not yet. But         
        she will be soon.       

         I just have to

         go! Let's go!          

     Come on! Come on! Let's    
     go! Come on! Come on!      

     What is she doing?         

         She likes you.         

    What happened to her leg?   

Cancer. They had                
 to amputate it.                

        Kind of like me.        

    You still have your leg.    

        Yeah, well, they        
     may as well have cut       

         It off. I can't        
     play tennis anymore.       

     Oh, you play tennis?       

             I did.             

     Well, what happened?       

         Car accident.          
     Shattered my knee.         

         It'll heal.            

         Yeah, but I'll         
    never play tennis again.    

     Do something else.         

         I have to go.          

        What's her name?        

             Annie.             

         You understand,        
        don't you Annie?        

 She knows what people need.    

        What's your name?       

         I'm charley.           

     Hi, charley. I'm Kelly.    

     Hi. She really does        
     know what people need.     

         I believe you.         

             Bye.               

    She needs a dog like you.   

         Do you mind?           

         Uh, no. No. No,        
         no, no, no.            

            Meniscus.           

         It's a little          
     bit more than that.        

            Kneecap?            

        It's a car crash.       
         What are you, a        

     Physical therapist?        

    Doctor. I--resident. I'm    
    at the Cleveland clinic.    

        You know, I know        
     some great exercises.      

        We can-we can get       
     you back up to speed.      

         Not the speed          
     that I was used to.        

     What were you used to?     

             Tennis.            

         Is that so?            

         I know you.            
     You're Kelly Maguire.      

 You're the number one seed     
    from the emergency room.    

         Was. I was the         
        number one seed.        

     You know, I was serious    
     about the exercises.       

     Thanks, but I think        
     I'm getting all the        

        Help that I need.       

    You know, sometimes it's    
 better to get a little bit of  

        Help at the right       
     time, than a lot of        

     Help at the wrong time.    

 What were you thinking of?     

             Lunch.             

 I meant about the exercises.   

     So did I. I thought        
     we could discuss it        

         Over lunch.            

     Let me guess, this is      
 "take a gimp to lunch" week.   

     The ballpark. South        
         of the center.         

     I will bring you lunch.    
        Say one o'clock?        

 One o'clock. Don't be late.    

             Hey, get back in   
             there! Stay! Over  
                there! Come on! 

     Get in there! Stay,        
         stay. No! No!          

     Get in! Move back in       
     there. Come on. Stay!      

     What are you doing?        

    You can't come down here!   

         I-I'm sorry.           

         I-I didn't-            

     Get your tail outta        
         here right now.        

             Now!               

         What's this?           

             A dog.             

     I know it's a dog.         

 What's it doing down here?     

         It's with me.          

        And who are you?        

        I'm charley. I'm        
     trying to save them.       

     Save them from what?       

         Being killed.          

         What do you            
     mean, being killed?        

     Killed put to sleep,       
         s-simonized?           

     Somebody's gonna wax       
         them to death?         

 Uh, yeah, may--I don't know!   

     Ah, excellent. Do they     
 show all the surgical suites?  

            All five.           

        Uh-huh. Well, I'm       
     going to need to have      

     A camera in one of the     
     convalescent areas.        

     Uh, how many people?       

     About half a dozen.        

        Okay, I could set       
         the room up for        

         Video. When do         
         we do this?            

         Next week. I'm         
     sorry for the short        

        Notice, but I was       
    just told by Dr. Ecklin.    

         You know him?          

        Yeah, I know him.       

         Uh-huh. Well, I        
     just uh, found out from    

        A memo. Actually,       
     I've not met him yet.      

            You will.           

         Uh-huh. Well, I        
     need to be able to         

         Show, uh rehab,        
     some of the different      

     Procedures, operating      
         techniques,            

     Pretty much anything       
         that has to do         

 With post-op or post-traumatic 
     uh, convalescence.         

            Got that?           

         No, but I will.        

    Good man. Any questions?    

            No, sir.            

    Aha. Good. Well, uh, you    
    can stop calling me sir.    

         I keep thinking        
         my dad's here.         

        Oh, look at you.        
     Look at you. Yeah.         

        Oh, hey, charley.       

 Cute little dudes, ain't they? 

     Yeah. You have a dog?      

 I did once. A long time ago.   

        What's your name?       

 Didn't I already tell you?     

         No, you were           
        too busy yelling.       

         Yeah, right.           

         My name's C.W.         

             Huh?               

        C.W. Like the two       
        letters, c and w.       

         Well, does it          
     stand for something?       

         Of course it           
     stands for somethin'.      

     Carter Wyatt. What's       
         your last name?        

Logan.                          

                         Logan? 

     You mean like the new      
 assistant administrator Logan? 

     Yeah, that's my mom.       

 Listen, you've got to get these
     mutts out of here.         

 And don't you tell your mom    
 about this do you understand?  

            I won't.            

         You better not.        

         She's kind of a        
     Miracle dog, you know?     

     What kind of miracles?     

         Well she makes         
     people ... Better.         

     Yeah? What do you mean?    

         Like she makes         
     'em do nice stuff?         

    No. Like, if you're sick    
     and you touch Annie,       
     you'll get better.         

         It-it's true.          

        See this scratch        
         right here?            

     Annie licked it and        
     now it's all better.       

             Really?            

     Well, uh, listen, you      
    best get out of here now.   

             Okay.              

        See you, charley.       

             Bye.               

             Hi.                

    So ... What's for lunch?    

        To begin we have        
 a wild green salad, with...    

 ...Bistro-grilled chicken.     

         You're kidding.        

     Come on, he resets         
     elbows, he cooks...        

     Maybe I should have        
     broken both my knees.      

    A little garlic, a little   
 onion, some papas fritas...    

 They're pan-fried potatoes.    

     And then for dessert we    
 have a little crème brûlée.    

         I'm impressed.         

        As you should be.       

         How's the knee?        

     Uh, it's better. Uh,       
     a lot better, actually.    

        We'll have you on       
 the court here in no time.     

 Yeah, well, I won't exactly    
     be playing Monica Seles    

     Tomorrow, but--but         
     uh, but it's better.       

            I'm glad.           

        Why did you want        
     to have lunch with me?     

     Well, I was hungry.        

 Ask a silly question and...    

     I thought I could help.    

             Why me?            

 Because you're prettier than   
 most of the patients I see.    

     Tennis was my life.        

             I know.            

        I can handle it.        

             I know.            

         I just thought         
        that maybe you'd        

        Like some company       
     while you're doing it.     

     I don't need another       
         disappointment.        

     Is that what I am, just    
     another disappointment?    

            Not yet.            

            Not ever.           

         We'll see.             

         Hey, girl, what        
     are you doing here?        

        Hey, Eddie, send        
     security up to the ICU     

 On the first floor, will you?  

     I think there's an         
     animal on the floor.       

        Uh, I don't know.       
         Maybe a dog.           

        Yes, I know a dog       
         when I see one,        

        But this one had        
     three legs, I think.       

 No, wise guy, it is not a UFO. 
    Just send security, okay?   

    Hey, Chad, how you doin'?   

             Good.              

    Aren't you still in pain?   

 No, my leg feels great, doc.   

        It's kinda like I       
     could run out of here      

         All the way to         
     the football field.        

     Well, not yet, but,        
     hmmm, you're close.        

 And I can't figure out why.    
 How's your range of motion?    

     Great. It's almost         
     like, uh ... A Miracle.    

 Yeah, that's amazing all right.
     You want a Miracle?        

        Get me tickets on       
     the fifty-yard line.       

        That's a Miracle.       

         You got it.            

 Oh, Leeza! Leeza let me talk to
        you for a minute.       

         Are you feeling        
     okay, Dr. Marchant?        

 I feel fine. It's Chad Ripley. 

 He's recovering too fast, and  
    I just can't explain it.    

         The man's just         
    gettin' better, I guess.    

 Well, nobody heals that fast,  
     not even superman.         

    Let me ask you something.   

        Have you noticed        
     anything peculiar or       

 Strange going on around here?  

         Other than the         
        usual mayhem? No.       

             Huh.               

         Good morning.          

     You're gonna love this.    

         Oh, yeah? What?        

     A mysterious animal        
     around the hospital.       

     And get this ... It        
         had three legs.        

     Oh, yeah? How many         
     heads did it have?         

     Just one, I think.         

(hums the "twilight zone" theme)
     do-do-do-do-do-do-do.      

     Welcome to area 51.        

 And by the time security got   
    there, some old guy with    

 Congestive heart failure had   
 made a miraculous recovery.    

             Really?            

        Somebody needs to       
         call Oprah.            

         No, no, don't          
         you call Oprah.        

    Call the custodian. Tell    
     him I need to see him.     

         I'll find him.         

             Okay.              

             Hey!               

             Hey!               

        I cannot believe        
    how fast you're healing.    

         I don't know,          
        it's weird, huh?        

     It's spooky. I mean,       
        you blew out your       

 Anterior crucial ligament,     
         and all of a           

 Sudden it's reconstructing,    
         like by itself.        

         I had surgery.         

     Nah, only to reattach.     

         Anyway, I gotta        
    get to physical therapy.    

     Right, yeah. You've        
     gotta keep that up.        

        You'll be playing       
 Wimbledon here by next month.  

     I don't know about         
     that, but, uh, maybe       

     Back on the court, huh?    

    Um, I'll call you later.    

             Yeah.              

             Okay.              

             [  %%  ]              

     Um, have you seen a        
 little boy about yea high?     

            No, sir.            

        No? Okay, thanks.       

     What you doin' here        
         during the day?        

 I had to feed the puppies.     

         Well, I'll feed        
         the puppies.           

     I got some food for 'em    
     up in the cafeteria.       

        You know, people        
     notice a kid like you      

         Roamin' around,        
         you know that?         

     I'll tell you what         
     you gotta do, though,      

     You have got to find       
     a home for these little    
     fellas, and quick.         

         I know. I just         
    need a little more time.    

        Well, you've got        
 'til the end of the month.     

         That's it.             

         I'll try, CW.          

         All right.             

         How come you           
        don't like dogs?        

     I never said that.         

     Yeah, well, you never      
     said you did like 'em.     

     You don't have one.        

        So ... Why don't        
         you have a dog?        

     I had one ... Once.        

         Did it die?            

             Yeah.              

         Five years ago.        

     His name was Horace.       

     He was a mutt. He sure     
    loved to ride in the car.   

         They all do.           

    How did he die? Old age?    

            No, uh...           

     I was just heading         
     down to the grocery        

        Store, and Horace       
        was sittin' right       

         Next to me, and        
     he jumped in the back      

        Seat with my boy,       
        Dwight, and he'd        

 Just, uh, turned twenty-five.  

        We was up on the        
 I-90 and, all of a sudden,     

    Horace, he starts barkin'   
     like nobody's business.    

     And I turned around        
 to look what was goin' on,     

 And this truck had pulled up   
 behind us and this dog was     

     Leaning out the window     
     and Horace was just        
     lettin' me know, and       

    Maybe he was just sayin'    
    hello to that other dog.    

     I don't know. I took       
    my eyes off the road for    

        Just a second. I        
     mean, it was just a        

        Split second. And       
     Dwight, he-he sees         

     Somethin' coming up        
     ahead and he yells         

        At me and I turn        
     around real quick, but     

 ... It wasn't quick enough.    

    There's no way I could've   
 missed that station wagon.     

 Plowed right into it, head on. 

     I never seen nothin'       
        like it, I mean,        

         Everything went        
         black as night.        

 When I woke up, I was right    
    here in the hospital ...    

 And, uh, m'back was broken,    

         My spleen was          
        ruptured, so they       

     Told me. I-I don't         
     remember much of that.     

 But ... Horace ... Dwight ...  

         I'm sorry.             

     Yeah, well, listen         
     ... I gotta get back       

        To work, and uh,        
     you know, so do you.       

     You have got to find       
 a place for these puppies.     

         I will, CW.            

     I know you will. You're    
     a good boy, charley.       

 Now you skedaddle outta here.  

         You know, since        
     I been seein' you,         

        My backaches have       
     absolutely stopped.        

        Is he right about       
         you being one          
     of those Miracle dogs?     

             Huh?               

     Bark the truth now.        

     Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

             (kiss)             

    What are you doing here?    

 I heard about this mysterious  
 night visitor. What is it?     

        Well, you got me.       

    Mr. Crawford says it's a    
     dog ... A Miracle dog.     

     Only has three legs.       

     What? A three-legged       
     dog in a hospital?         

 Yep, he said once the animal   
 touched him, he was healed.    

         And was he?            

 You'd know better than I, but  
     his physician says         
     that his arteries are      

     Suddenly clear and his     
    arrhythmia is stabilized.   

     That's impossible.         

        I know. Have fun.       

     A three-legged dog?        

             Whoa.              

     Hey, hey, hey, wait,       
         wait, wait!            
    Where you going so fast?    

 Oh, I'm gonna go meet some     
     friends at the park.       

     Oh, you got some new       
     friends. That's nice.      

         Bring 'em over.        

             Sure.              

 Uh, when will dad be home?     

    Soon. He's checking out a   
    prowler at the hospital.    

            Burglar?            

             Hmm.               

     A three-legged one,        
     according to witnesses.    

         Three legs?            

             Mm-hm.             

     What did he steal?         

 Well, some hearts, apparently. 

 You see, last night, a dog or  
 something went into some of    

     The patients' rooms.       

         What happened?         

        Well, nothing bad       
     from what I can gather.    

     The patients seemed        
     to improve because         

 Of this mysterious visitor.    

        They got better.        

             Yes.               

        You know, I asked       
     the custodian about        

     It because, um, having     
        an animal in the        

 Hospital would be a serious    
 infringement of the rules,     

     And could get a person     
     into a lot of trouble.     

         But he didn't          
     know anything about it.    

     Didn't they catch her?     

             Hm?                

         Uh the animal?         

            Did they?           

Oh, no, no. She just vanished. A
 wondrous visit from a UFO.     

             UFO?               

             Mm.                

 Unidentified furry object.     

            Charley.            

             Yes?               

    Don't be late for dinner.   

            I won't.            

        Oh! Good heavens!       
     What are you doing on      

     My property, young man?    

 Um, I was taking a shortcut.   

         Do I know you?         

    You were at the hospital.   

             Was.               

            How come?           

             Cancer.            

             Sorry.             

        Makes two of us.        

 My dog, Annie, had cancer.     

        Doc Elliot had to       
        cut her leg off.        

        I wish that would       
         work for me.           

         Well, maybe my         
         dog could help.        

     How on earth could         
        your dog help me?       

     She's a Miracle dog.       

    It would take a Miracle,    
     if I believed in them.     

 Run along now. I've wasted     
     enough time on you.        

     Are you going back?        

        What business is        
         that of yours?         

            It isn't.           

            Are you?            

         I-I don't want         
     to, but I have to.         

             When?              

         This afternoon.        

     I'll come visit you.       

        You want to come        
         and visit me?          

        Sure, my mom and        
         dad work there.        

         I'm charley.           

     Charley. Katherine.        

        I'll bring Annie.       

     Oh, now, that'd be         
     quite a trick. I'd         

         Like to see you        
     sneak her in there.        

             Bye.               

                Little hooligan.

 Yes. How dare he               
try to be friendly?             

             Edward, if you have
             a point to make, I 

         Wish you would do so.  

 No, no, no, not                
at all, Mrs. Mannion.           

 You make all the               
points around here.             

     Will you be                
staying outside long?           

         I don't know. Perhaps. 

 Yes, of course. Ring           
if you need assistance.         

             I need assistance. 

 No, Mrs. Mannion. You          
never need assistance.          

 You are forced to accept it    
on occasion, but that's all.    

                         Edward?

     Um, could you stay awhile? 
        Perhaps we could talk?  

Of course.                      

                 But only uh,   
                if you want too.

                 I mean, it is  
                 not an order.  

I know, Mrs.-                   

                     Katherine. 

Katherine.                      

             [  %%  ]              

     We're here ... Katherine.  

     Annie can you make         
    people better? 'cause if    

     You can, then your         
        puppies can, too.       

             [  %%  ]              

             Mama?              

         Sweetheart?            

         Where am I?            

     You're in a hospital.      

             [  %%  ]              

     You know how many case     
     histories I have from      
     these dog stories?         

         It's the talk          
        of the hospital.        

         Yeah, but these        
        were all puppies.       

     We have puppies now?       

        Well, look, I've        
     talked to security,        

     The custodial staff        
     and the night nurses,      

     And nobody has seen        
 anything. Just nothing. Zip.   

         You know what's        
         really amazing?        

             Hm.                

        Each one of these       
     people is actually         

        Healing at a much       
         faster rate.           

    I know it's unbelievable,   
     but it's verifiable.       

         I'm writing a          
         report on it.          

     When's the conference?     

     Tomorrow, and I've         
    got the proof right here.   

     I just don't know how      
    the board or Dr. Ecklin's   
         gonna take it.         

     Sweetheart, you're         
     gonna hit a home run.      

     Honey, I couldn't hit      
 sand if I fell off a camel.    

     This is remarkable.        

 That's a good thing, right?    

     Yeah. You know, a short    
        time ago I would        
     have said that uh,         

 There was no Chance of you     
setting a foot on a tennis court
 for the rest of your life.     

         But, uh, being         
        an ardent man of        

        Science, I would        
     say this is nothing        
     short of a Miracle.        

 Dr. Marchant. Hi...I uh ... I- 

     You were just in the       
         neighborhood,          

     So you thought you'd       
         drop by, right?        

     Right, yeah, yeah.         

         Haven't you            
     forgotten something?       

         Oh, I didn't- I        
     didn't know that I         

     Needed a mask in here.     
     I th- I thought that-      

         Your charts.           

     Charts, right, right.      

 And I expect a full report.    

 Right. Th- thank you, sir.     

     Charley, uh, has, like,    

         A surprise he          
        wants to show me,       

     And I was wondering        
         if maybe you'd         
         like to come.          

         Anything to get        
        out of this bed.        

             Okay.              

     Well, these are the        
     puppies I was telling      
         you guys about.        

        I love puppies! I       
     saw his big brother.       

         Oh, uh, mother.        
        This is Jennifer.       

         You want her?          

     What, you mean it?         

             Yeah.              

         Well, I-I can't        
     take her now, but...       

         Okay, but you          
     can't wait too long.       

     Everybody is talking       
    about these Miracle dogs.   

 Okay, wh-what are their names? 

         Well you guys          
     just met um, Jennifer.     

     And next to her is a       
     boy. His name is Lopez.    

        And over here is        
     Elton and there's John.    

 And there's Max and Annie.     

     Where did you get them?    

         They're hers.          

     I found them the second    
     day we came to town.       

        You know, you are       
     right about one thing.     

             What?              

         You have to get        
        them outta here.        

         Are we ready?          

         Rock and roll.         

             Great.             

     Uh, welcome, doctors.      

 If you'd care to take your     
     seats we can begin.        

     Um, by the way, we're      
     doing a live statewide     
         hookup today.          

 Okay, in suite one, a heart    
     pacemaker implant is in    

 Progress, and, over here...    

        ...A patient who        
     just had the procedure     

         Two days ago           
     is being monitored.        

 Um, if any of you would care to
 communicate with any of the    
     physicians or patients,    

 Feel free to do so with the    
 microphones in front of you.   

     Now the implantation       
 of the device, as you know,    

     Is accomplished through    
     the aorta, with the        
    aid of a small camera...    

         I gotta make a         
    call. I'll be right back.   

...Chest cavity. Okay, now first
 a little historical data about 
 the pacemaker device itself.   

     We have chosen to use a    
         demand unit            

 Which will take control if the 
patient's heart beat falls below
     the pre-programmed...      

     Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!      

         Hey, hey, hey!         

             W-w-w--            

             [  %%  ]              

             Hey!               

         Round 'em up!          

         I got 'em!             

         I got 'em!             

         Here we go. How        
         many we got?           

         Oh, uh. Hold           
         on, hold on.           

        One go in there?        

    There's one right there.    

     One went in there.         

             [  %%  ]              

     Oh, oh, oh. Good dog.      
         Wait, wait.            

     Ooh, ooh. All right.       
     Hold on! Here we go!       

     I got one! Okay, no,       
     no, no. C'mere, c'mere.    

     Hey, hey, hey! Here's      
     another over there.        

        There's one down        
     here, too. Look out.       

     Get this one over here!    

 I got them. I got them. Okay.  

 Wait, wait! One, two, three!   

     Where's the other?         

     The implantation of        
         the device,            

 As you know is accomplished    
        through the aorta       

         With the aid           
     of a small camera....      

 ...Inserted simultaneously     
    through the chest cavity.   

     The pacemaker leads        
        are then threaded       

 Through the veins which lead   
     back to the heart.         

 These leads employ another     
 breakthrough in technology.    

 Now, as you can see, the uh,   
     implantation is very...    

     ...Smooth and quick.       

    Now here you can see the    
         dramatic change        

 That's been documented in this 
    patient in just two days.   

 As you'll note, the patient, a 
     man in his uh, late...     

 ...Sixties, has completely     
     transformed his um,        
     physical appearance.       

     Can there be a more        
     magnificent sight for      
     a surgeon than this?       

     As the venerable saying    
     goes, make sure...         

        Jeez Louise! What       
     are you doing in here?     

 ...As you can see, this one    
     really tells the tale.     

         Thank you.             

         (clapping)             

        I'm sorry, ma'am.       

 Oh, don't be. She's wonderful. 

 But what is she doing here?    

         Uh, exercise.          

    You exercise dogs in the    
            hospital?           

     No...They exercise me.     

        Is this that dog        
        that little boy,        

     Charley, was telling       
            me about?           

     I sure hope not, ma'am.    

     Oh. Oh. Can she come       
     back and visit me?         

         I don't-I don't        
        think so, ma'am.        

         I'm sorry for          
        the disturbance.        

        Bye. Bye, Annie.        

     Good girl. Good girl.      
         There we go.           

             (sigh)             

     Hello? Animal control?     

Hi, this is Leeza Madison at the
        Cleveland clinic.       

         We have a-a-a          
         situation here,        

 And I need for you to send one 
of your officers over as soon as
            possible.           

     Yes, that would be         
        fine. Thank you.        

         What a day.            

 I'm so sorry, Mr. Aldrich,     
     but I have no choice.      

     You can pick up your       
     severance pay at the       
        cashier's office        

 When you deliver your keys and 
     your security card.        

     Why didn't you tell me     
 when I gave you the Chance?    

    It's a long story, ma'am.   

        I have the time.        

     But I don't, do I?         

             Ma'am.             

         Dr. Elliot.            

            Ooh, hey!           

    Didn't expect to see you.   

        Doc, did you get        
     my message about Annie?    

     Yeah, I did. Didn't        
         you get mine?          

             No.                

             Oh.                

             What?              

 She's gone. Uh, I had-I had a  
 visitor a few days ago, let a  
    bunch of my animals out.    

         Kidnapped?             

 Mm, more like a jailbreak.     

    Animal rights activists?    

        It's hard to say.       

 Charley's gonna be heartbroken.

         I'm sorry.             

    No, uh-ac-actually, it's    
     something else. Um, you    
     know a Tom Donaldson?      

        Yeah, sure, he's        
     a good friend of mine.     

     Well, then you knew        
     he had a heart bypass.     

             Yeah.              

         Well he's made         
     a remarkable recovery.     

    That's not a surprise. He   
     is a tough old bird.       

Yeah, yeah, but he claims it was
because a mysterious animal paid
         him a visit.           

         Zoo medicine.          

             What?              

     That's what they call      
     it sometimes when-when     
     animals are used, uh,      

     For recovery therapy       

 Yeah, it's-it's uh, it's kinda 
     like a placebo effect.     

     You know, the patient      
     thinks it's the animal,    
     but really, it's them.     

 Mm, like a positive attitude.  
     This really works?         

     ...You'd be surprised.     

     I already am. What do      
     you know about it?         

     Well, a lot. Here, come    
     on in the office. I'll     
     show you some stuff.       

     What are you doing?        

            Hey, kid.           

     Funny thing. I had         
 another one of my migraines.   

         I picked up the        
 puppies and now it's gone.     

     Maybe you were right.      

     What are you doing         
        with the puppies?       

         My job animal          
     control, remember?         

     You can't take them.       

 I got no choice in the matter. 

     What's gonna happen?       

         I'm sorry.             

         I'm sorry.             

 I done what I could, charley.  

         What happened?         

    Well I told you, we just    
 couldn't keep 'em that long.   

 Did someone say something?     

             No.                

They just ... Ran out. They were
waitin' for me when I opened the
             door               

             And...             

     Where you going, C.W.?     

     Oh, it's about time        
     I got me another job.      

 This one's wearin' me out.     

         They fired you?        

             Yeah.              

 It's okay. It's no big deal.   

        You take care of        
     yourself now, you hear?    

             Hi.                

        How was your day?       

        You have to give        
        him his job back.       

             Who?               

             C.W.               

             Why?               

     Because he wasn't the      
     one who had the puppies    
        in the basement.        

             I did.             

            You did?            

        All by yourself?        

     Why did you do that?       

     Because they would         
         have put the           
        puppies to sleep!       

         I had to save          
        Annie's puppies!        

     I was gonna try to         
     give them all homes...     

     ...But now they're         
         all gonna die.         

 Annie, Max and the puppies.    

             Well?              

    How would you feel about    
     moving back to Denver?     

        They didn't fire        
         you, did they?         

         Uh ... Well...         

         All right,             
     that does it. I quit.      

 The-the Grant, everything.     

     Well, you don't have to    
     worry about the Grant.     

     There is no Grant. They    
         took it away.          

        They didn't even        
         talk to me!            

         Well, it wasn't        
         the clinic.            

     The clinic wanted us to    
     stay, and the board        
    really wanted us to stay.   

            They did?           

    Yes, they did! It was Dr.   
 Ecklin. He refused to give Mr. 
     Aldrich back his job.      

         So ... I quit.         

 I had to. It was a matter of   
    principle. I'm so sorry.    

 Nah, it's okay. Look ... I'm   
     still a pediatrician.      

         I know we were         
     counting on the Grant,     

    But I can still practice.   

 No it's a-it's a black Mark    
 on your record and I'm sorry.  

             Aah!               

     Black, blue, it doesn't    
    matter what color it is.    

         We're together.        

         I never liked          
     you working, anyway.       

     I love you, doctor.        

         Umm, good.             

     What are you doing?        
     You can't do that!         

         You can't throw        
     your research away!        

         Sure, I can.           

         No, you can't!         
         You'll need it!        

     No, I won't. I got you.    

             Oh!                

             Hey.               

    Have you seen Dr. Logan?    

         He's gone.             

     Oh, I just wanted to       
    tell him something. I'll    
     give him a call later.     

 You can't. Dr. Logan and his   
 wife were let go this morning. 

             What?              

     It's true. Andy, he's-     

    He's already gone. Andy?    

 Here, sweetie, I'll take it.   

    Charley ... I'm so sorry.   

     I tried to call the        
 county, but it was too late.   

 I'll get him a dog when we     
     get back to Denver.        

     Somehow, I don't think     
     it'll be the same.         

     (cell phone rings)         

             Hello.             

     No. We were just--         
         now? Okay.             

         Who was that?          

    It was Andy. He wants us    
    to come by the ballpark.    

             Why?               

    To say good-bye, I guess.   

     Good thing you called.     
     We were just on our        
         way outta here.        

         I just wanted          
        to say good-bye.        

     And to you, Mrs. Logan.    

        Take care, Andy.        

     Good luck, Dr. Malone.     

         You're going to        
         make a fine GP.        

         You think?             

             Yeah.              

 There's actually someone else  
 who wanted to say good-bye.    

     Hi. I just wanted to       
    say thank you to charley.   

        Come on and give        
     me a hug, charley.         

         Here. Come on.         

         You changed my         
         life, charley.         

         It wasn't me.          

         Sure it was.           

        No, it was Annie.       

        And the puppies.        

     You're not going to        
     leave without thanking     
         her, are you?          

             What?              

        She deserves some       
         thanks, too.           

    Oh, you guys, come here!    

        (to Kelly) but I        
     thought they were-         

             No...              

     ...Dr. Elliot went and     
        got them himself.       

             He did?            

     After you told him         
     about the recoveries       

     And your research,         
         he went down           
     the very next day.         

     He kept one of the         
     puppies, charley. John.    

             Great!             

     Uh, I never showed         
        him my research.        

             I know.            

        There's one more        
     stop you need to make.     

 Ah, come in, doctor Logan.     

    I believe this is yours.    

             Yes.               

 I showed it to Dr. Ecklin ...  
     And he agrees with me      

 That it's-it's remarkable...   

         .And should be         
 implemented in the clinic.     

            He does?            

        Mm-hm. Isn't that       
         right ... Nate?        

         Yes it is...           

     ...Aunt Katherine.         

             Um...              

     ...I threw this away.      

     Oh, I know. Dr. Malone     
        retrieved it and        
        brought it to me.       

 You see, it's really quite     
     remarkable research.       

         Isn't it, Nate?        

 Dr. Logan, um, I was wrong.    

 The clinic would like to have  
 both you and your wife resume  
    your duties immediately.    

 Uh, that is, uh, if you'll     
     accept my apology.         

             And...             

     And I've reinstated Mr.    
        Aldrich, as well.       

 The truth is, the clinic never 
     wanted you to leave.       

        They informed me        
        of the decision,        

     Which it seems Nate        
     had made on his own,       

 And since...I'm the largest    
     donor to the clinic,       

        Without whom this       
     wing would not exist,      

 I persuaded Nate to reconsider.
         Didn't I, Nate?        

             Yes.               

 And what's more...He's also    
 instituting a zoo medicine     

     Facility right here        
         in this wing.          

     Isn't that wonderful?      

     It's uh, unbelievable,     
         is what it is.         

    Uh, if you'll excuse me?    

         Now..Where is          
     that son of yours?         

 Um, he's outside in the hall,  
    waiting with his mother.    

 Well would you mind asking     
     him to step in here?       

 No, not at all. And ... Thank  
     you, Mrs. Mannion.         

 Uh-uh. Thank you, Dr. Logan.   

     Here comes your dad.       

        Uh, she wants to        
     talk to you, charley.      

             Me?                

         Our charley?           

     Yep. And guess what?       
 Mr. Aldrich got his job back.  

             He did?            

             Yeah.              

        Oh, that's great!       

         (to charley)           
        okay, go on, son.       
         Go talk to her.        

    Now ... What's goin' on?    

     It looks like we're        
        not going back to       
        Denver after all.       

         We're not?             

         No. We've been         
        reinstated, too.        

            We have?            

     Effective immediately.     

 Oh, well ... I don't know if   
    I want to be reinstated.    

             Why?               

             Well...            

     I was thinking about       
    what you said, about ...    

 Sometimes a mom should be at   
home, and I think maybe this mom
     should be at home now.     

 It would be the right time for 
 this mom to be at home, maybe. 

     You feeling all right?     

     Oh, yeah, never better,    
         but I'm hungry.        

         We just had            
     breakfast an hour ago.     

             I know.            

     And you're hungry.         

     Mm-hm, very hungry.        

    For something like...Um,    
         ice cream.             

         Ice cream?             

     Um, and...Pickles.         

     And pi ... Pickles.        

            Pickles.            

             Bingo!             

             Hi.                

Oh, charley. Listen, there's one
     thing I want from you.     

             What?              

 I want that puppy you brought  
     by to see me, Lopez.       

             Sure!              

     Charley, thank you!        

    Thank you for everything    

    It was the dogs. They're    
            special.            

    No, they're...Miraculous.   

        Thanks for giving       
     C.W. His job back.         

     Oh, don't mention it.      

         When can you           
        come home again?        

         Next week. The         
     cancer's in remission.     

         Where's that?          

        Well, it's-it's a       
     very wonderful place.      

     Well...Then I'm glad.      

     Yeah, me, too. Will you    
        promise to bring        
     Annie by to see me?        

             I will.            

            Promise.            

         Here he comes.         

            Come on.            

        Dad, wait! Wait!        

    It was so nice of charley   
     to give us Jennifer.       

        Yeah, but I think       
        our little friend       

     Charley gave us a lot      
    more than just Jennifer.    

    Well, ain't you the one?    

     I didn't expect to         
     see you around here.       

     Heard you got your         
     job back. I'm glad.        

     Yeah, I got lucky.         

     I just wanted to stop      
     by and say thanks.         

            For what?           

        You know, for not       
     saying anything about      
        me and the dogs.        

        Oh, I'd have done       
     the same for anybody.      

         My mom says you        
     were protecting me.        

        Well, mom says a        
         lot of things.         

         Truth is, I            
     was protecting myself.     

 I can't let people think I'm   
         gettin' soft.          

        Hang on a second.       

        Where you goin'?        

     What in tarnation! You     
     want me to get fired       
         all over again?        

     You know, he looks         
         just like you.         

        Got a runny nose        
         and his-his            
     tail's always waggin'.

             Bye.               

            Charley!            

         Oh, whoa...            

     Oh, no, no... He's not     
     even housebroke,uh ...

     gotta use this now,        

        Elton. You got to       
         use that paper.        

             Huh?               

 What you say, boy? Oh, your    
 breath is worse than mine is.  

    That's sayin' a lot, huh?   

    I can tell you're nothin'   
    but trouble, huh? Are you   
 one of those Miracle dogs?     

 Well, with you around, it's a  
Miracle I don't drown, huh? Hey,
         little buddy!          

             [  %%  ]              

     Master Charles, come       
         over here. Yes.        

        Uh, hi. What are        
         you doing here?        

     Well, master Charles.      
         How are you?           

             You?               

        You, my boy. Miss       
     Katherine asked me         
         to fetch you.          

            Fetch me?           

     Yes, and your friends.     

            What for?           

         A surprise.            

         Oh, cool! I'll         
        go get the guys!        

     Before you do there's      
     just one other thing.      

             What?              

Do you remember the day you took
    the shortcut through Mrs.   
     Mannion's mansion?         

             Yeah.              

     Hm, well, I wanted         
    to thank you personally.    

         I didn't get a         
     Chance at the hospital.    

            What for?           

         For changing my        
         life, charley.         

 Oh, don't thank me. It was     
     Annie and her puppies.     
    They're the Miracle dogs.   

     Well, I would consider     
    it an honor if you would    
     take that shortcut         

     Whenever you please.       
        On one condition.       

             What?              

        That you stop by        
     and say hello to miss      

         Katherine and I        
         every so often.        

     Sure. I'd like that.       

     So would we. Go on,        
     call your friends.         

     And the dogs. We have a    
 surprise for them, as well.    

         You're full of         
     surprises, aren't you?     

    You know, miss Katherine    
     says that very thing.      

    How would you like to go    
     to a major league game?    

             Today?             

        This very moment!       
         After one brief        
     stop. Go on, go on!        

     Call your friends!         

             Okay.              

             [  %%  ]              

             Whoa!

         You guys are           
     really famous now!
