Doug, sit down. CED wants
to tell you something about your father.

The FBI would not understand it,

Your father is forced to endure many

I have to suffer to live,
We all have to suffer to live.

Anyway, it's a great man.

And will always remain a standby.
A so-i.

Like the boy who stood at the bar
and the priest comes and pulls her chair.

The boy says, "Wait a little.
I hate to tell you this, "

"Thi but not waste time around here,
because I know that there is no God. "

The priest says, "Yeah, like you?"

The boy says:
"I am exploring the North Pole."

"And I caught a blinding storm.
I was frozen. "

"I do not see anything and I was frozen."

"And I prayed that somehow if there
God, save me right now. "

"But God has not been shown."

The priest said:

"How you? Only you're alive.
He has saved you. "

The boy says: "No. God
no never showed up there. "

"But instead came an Eskimo
which led me to the camp and saved me. "

It was Janice, my wife,
that stands right there.

She's my Eskimo.

Hi, Doug.

Excuse me.

It's a wonderful girl.

Really loves you.
I can say that.

The good news for you is that
of an alibi for the robbery of Cambridge,

And the good news for me
is that you know something.

Everyone attacks
someone armored cars.

Knew the guys followed him to the safe.

Yes?
At least I've heard of and the.

One of the boys destroyed
joncþiune box.

Here's that came.
Hello!

What kind of lad and that's
you leave the door open for you to a. ..

What is it?

You need to get something
the soul, otherwise

I pretend that you listen
all night,

while I think
something else.

Well.

A few days ago, the bank where
work I was robbed.

Four men have forced me
to open the safe.

I took hostages.

They blindfolded me and took me away.

Then they stopped and left me at the beach ...

And one of the guys told me

get up to go
feet in water.

It was the longest ride
of my life.

I thought maybe I fall
on any rock.

And at one point I felt the water.

Sorry.

Not your fault.

A guy from the FBI told me they look
like being in mourning.

FBI?

Working with the FBI?
Yes.

What does that mean?

I check? I supervise?

Cam has anything like this.

And have any suspects, clues, anything?

He tried to say I intimiteze
All that will scotocii's Charlestown,

The Charlestown boys and girls and i. ..

Really?
Yes.

And most children
struggling to do something,

and not allow you to have a decent ice rink.

I know, it's embarrassing. Nobody puts
money in that place.

Yes.

Yes, I know. Majority of children
I say "tunie.

That means "strange". It is a person
come from elsewhere, that's all.

Of course.

Those kids were talking nonsense.

Michael, what's up?
What are you doing?

Well. Today I'm fine.
I want a Scotch with ice.

What happened?

Have you checked that thing?
What?

Driving license.

Yes.

And?
Nothing.

So, no need

What?
You heard me, right?

What, are you and the assassin now?

Bat and I plains, young man.

You really need to get
the electric chair to tell you that back?

Not to be a dramatic and, yes?

Just ...

When one of them
David attacked him,

I have seen and have a neck tattoo.

What?

It was one of those
Irish warrior tattoos.

I'm afraid that if they say this
I will ask to testify.

What do you think I should do?

Tell them of the FBI.

If the guy has the file
and I'm sure it has

tattoo will be noted in the file.

We will arrest the next day.

For armed robbery.
A primimeascã to about 30 years.

Of course he's gonna do, and worry lest
Somebody seek witness

and the FBI probably gonna kick you
in a witness protection program.

Maybe we'll send you somewhere

Cleavland kind in Arizona.

You know, somewhere safe.

Or ...

you could wait.

You're not all countries must
on a single card.

You're most vulnerable in this situation.

The FBI are ordinary people nuiþi,

who want to catch the nelegiuiþi
and to-and see beyond their lives.

Claire, you need to wear thi
for themselves.

You seem to be an expert.

Even the and a.
Only because I watched TV a lot.

I looked over at CSI.

A and So are a great expert
in anything like this.

And CSI Miami and CSI New York.

I'm looking at all.

I looked at all.

Are you ready for the world.
And the "Bones" I forgot.

We know each other pretty well
to tell you that I can say that this machine

Why? Even have a Prius?
Yes.

Really?
I had a Preius.

But it was vandalized.
What happened?

I have no idea. I was forced
1.6 km to go through projectiles.

And then, guys that have started to ...

Do you?

I do not know and if those guys were, but ...
What guys?

They started ... They began to
scream at me when I exceed it.

Then they became very aggressive and i. ..

And what did they do?

When they started
throwing bottles

I realized that I just loved
to walk among the projectiles.

They threw bottles at you?

I'm all right.
Only that we had far to go.

Never mind.

No, but you will need to cut and you with it.

Thi not remember what they looked like?

We need your help.
I can not tell you about what it is.

And you never allowed me to wonder
ever about it.

And you know that might hurt you
some people.

Whose car we go?

I hope to be home.

Who's there?
Open!

Zounds, that hurts!
Stops you.

If you stay here a week,

Let's go.

We can not kill people.

You called me.

Desmond Elden.
Yes?

Vericom working on.
I never did kid cavity.

Ã boys knew, most of them
slub did not spectacular.

They stole armored machine
during working hours.

Foreman said, "Yes, it's been here yesterday."
And we showed the time sheet spreadsheet.

But you can not Vericom's play
because it is a public company.

If you're not going to work,
means that you're sick.

And "Dezzy" our

Bank Boston, Cummins Armored,
Brinks Arlington,

Cambridge Merchants.

Jesus Christ!

Your parents live in Charlestown?

No, Dad probably
reached the suburbs.

But your mother?

Thi has not and could not say.
I abandoned when I was six.

What happened?

He's gone.

It's okay.

Well ...

A sound woke me up.

At first I did not know what it is.

Sounds to be an animal and that.

I have never heard a man
to cry until then.

I got in lingerie

and I saw my dad in the kitchen.

The first thing I remember,
e ashtray.

I think we were a hundred cigarettes in it.

And a mountain of ash.

It stopped crying

and stood in front of the TV's that run

a black and white image, no sound.

I think I did not know what to do.

They looked at me as I stood
there-in threshold of the door and said to me:

"Your mother left
and never came back. "

Exactly and a.

Smoke and eat there
in front of the TV, at six in the morning.

One year before
lost our dog and i. ..

I wanted to do this job,

in case you have lost

and you can call us,
the guy who found us the dog.

Dad, and I did today, should be able
to tell you that I helped to make them show,

but I helped.

He stayed in the kitchen with a beer

while I went
school alone on the street

asking people if
I have seen my mother.

Her name was Doris.

My grandmother had a restaurant
"Tangerine Flower."

I imagined that she went there.

Then I realized
to matter.

Nothing changes the fact that ...
no matter

Wherever they have gone

had a good reason
to go from here.

I wanted to be my mother.

There was never returned.

Now you know something about my family

but still does not show you the apartment.

How bad could it be?

Desmond Elden.
System Engineer at Vericom.

Twenty-two years.

Alfred Magloan. Only in Boston
may be a guy named Alfred MacGloan.

Mr. Magloan not never met
a car that can not be stolen.

He's very talented.

It 's able to tell you steal your Cherokee
while you doing what you keys.

James Coughlin.

His father was killed in prison.
His mother died of AIDS.

Did the shot Brandon Lee, in a
cemetery, just before turning 19.

He bled to death.

When the judge asked why
did it, said: "I did not like his face."

A kid did nine years of decay
for murder.

Ã knew boys plan and execute
minuþios everything and very disciplined.

And Coughlin is not the best
for it.

I believe that the "architect" is the guy.

Best friend of Coughlin;
Douglas MacRay.

Live together.
Se-ntâlne up with his sister and Coughlin,

is most likely
"Cãrãu and the" florist

who hired him and his father McRay.

You'll need explanatory drawings
Sheet for the people knew.

Mac senior received any life imprisonment
for robbery in Nashwood,

they are convinced that most
You remember him.

He hijacked a car
values in New Hampshire

and one security guard saw her face.
It and So ...

I executed both
with their own weapons.

I think Mac's heritage is that
that any drive on me and armored cars

not allowed to leave the car,

even if his partner
has a gun to his head.

The young man did MacRay
eight months jail

because it was attacked with a gun
Cashier nail on the Bay Bank

after being kicked out
of professional hockey.

Professional hockey?
Yes. It was a big star for a while.

It was selecþionat the team. He went
in a camp and there, total shock.

He gave out of trouble, and he beat the boys ...

In this hockey you're paid,
bath to you, right?

Yes, but not with teammates.

MacRay came home and joined
family business.

And those things, and those habits.

From hockey to come to the drug.

We are very far from the Grand Jury.

And never ever gonna get approval
The monitor you 24 hours a day

Unless they any of idioþii
ã knew a convert to Islam.

A and therefore a strong case built to.

All right. Come to work.

I told all friends
about you.

Really?
Yes.

I hope only good things.
Yes.

All right.
I said I'm very jealous,

because they can not afford to believe
how lucky are you?

That you moved in Charlestown
that to set you up with a rock breaker.

No. They believe that ...

They think it's a kind of reward.

But why?
For that robbery? I have no idea.

I feel somewhat foreign to them.

What?
What do you look to you?

My brother died on a day like this.

When was this?

He was small.
He had malignant lymphoma.

And now, every time is one day
sunny, I think someone dies.

Beyond wrong, do you?

No. I'm sure would be happy
thinks that you're at it.

It's a nice day.

I feel wonderful.
That's good.

Then, I will miss îþi
while I'm gone.

Money, mutt!

What the hell are you doing here?

Nothing.
Nothing? What's this?

Who were here?
With nobody.

Let's get the hell out of here.
You mean this is yours?

Yes.
Yes, the Hawaiian pizza?

Come, sit down. I just arrived.
I said "no."

We gotta go.
Stay the hell down. Sit.

Good.
Good.

Hello!
Claire.

Jem.

Jem. Jem, pure and simple.
I am a friend of sucker that.

Nice acquainted.
Sit down. Sit down. Relax, okay?

I saw thi's Avalanche
parked after the corner.

Avalanche site?
Truck.

Yes, van.
Truck at work.

Dougy's a great worker.
Yes.

We know the long or ...

Since I was 6 years.
We are like brothers, right?

But he never mentioned you.
Do you keep a secret, do you?

How did you say your name?
Jim or Gem?

Je ... Ge ...
In fact, both are correct.

Teachers, after I grew older,
nuiau ordinary always say:

"Hey, contact him on this,

I think that was a kind of arrogant.

No matter.

You what you do, Claire?

I work at a bank.

Are your bank manager?
Sounds funny. What bank?

Cambridge Merchants.
Not far from here.

Cambridge Merchants.

Wait, that's just the

Yes, yes.
Yes, I just read about it.

What folly!

And then, how ...
How did you meet?

We met at the launch.

Super!

Love among the underwear, right?
It happens more often than you think.

Hey, Claire, do not waste Thi
too much time here.

Dougy, it's really dedicated to work.

And i always take work home.
And has not it, Doug?

All right.
It's okay, bro.

Take care of yourself, yes? Be good.
See you at home.

I'm glad I met you.
And me.

It appears that you have not told
all your friends about me.

Who pursues you, Jem?
Me or her?

I told that I saw thi's Avalanche.

You have nothing to worry about that.
Everything's under control.

So, try to shoot us
the dirty, do you?

Yes, try to fool.

Tell me you have a plan
spare, Dougy.

Because the only solution
I see myself,

is that you're not interested only
to hit it in this fucking bitch.

And that clumea it happens to be
even the girl who ... Phooey!

The only person we can
FBI puts on the head!

Calm down, okay?

Do not think that it would have to be
isteþi a little more time?

Isteþi?
Yes.

Sure. Let's begin to rule
all witnesses.

Yes. I go to my deputy to
make a felaþie. They are sufficiently isteþ?

And of others guys are not gonna say anything
lest you be scared!

Because I want to be apþi
for the next robbery.

Thi-I said,

Well, once I finish it!

No more guards

One of the guys show that GI Joe.

Yes?

Hey, look at them, I know you're happy
this motherfucker in the city,

but I stayed nine years

Only nine years, that's all.

That will be the last robbery.
After that we take a guard.

You're damn puþoi Sudie,
They want to control everything.

Understand what you mean?
There can serve ice cream and a ...

Yes. But, sometimes you gotta
to tell you solve problems yourself, you know?

Well.

I'm thinking ... to go somewhere.

To leave the city.
Tighten the screw?

I want to make a change.
Aha. No way!

"You want to make a change?

Whether he got the police or not.
