I'm rich, biatch.

(CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING)

You filming us?

Hey, man, what's happening?

We were riding.

Car just broke down?
Yeah.

Try it one more time.
Try it one more time.

Short bursts.

(ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG)

MAN: Hey, yo, Dave!

What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're...

We stopped the engine.
We can't get it started again.

MAN: Yo, Dave!

Uh...

You put too much gas in it.
That's what I'm saying.

(MARCHlNG BAND PLAYlNG)

I have the butterfly
wide open.
Try it now. Try it now.

(ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG)

Stop, stop, stop.

How much of this
did you spray in there?

He said, "How much of that
did you spray in there?"

How much of this
did you spray in?

I don't know
what his answer is.

That's right. Saturday,
coming at you!

The Block Party of life!

With Kanye West,

Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common.

Did I mention the Fugees?
Did I mention Dead Prez?

Did I tell you Erykah Badu
was gonna be there?

And Jill Scott's gonna
be there. And The Roots crew
is gonna be there.

And yours truly,
David Chappelle!

That's right!
Once in a lifetime!

I've got the Brooklyn Steppers
behind me.

And we do a little something
like this.

Saturday night,
Saturday afternoon

featuring barbecued chicken
for lunch.

DAVE: It's a celebration,
bitches.

It's a celebration.

All right, I'm gonna go
talk some stuff
and then we're gonna...

And then,
I'm gonna bring you up, Kanye.

MAN: Hey, yo, Brooklyn,
make some noise for Mos Def,
y'all.

MOS DEF: Brooklyn.

Bed-Stuy!

Brooklyn!

Let the shouting out begin!

(PERFORMlNG TWO WORDS)

hands up, hustlers, busters,
boosters, hoes, everybody

Most High, we thank you just
for being here with us.

We thank you
for this day, God.

The sun is shining.
They said
it was supposed to rain.

But, God,
you letting your face show
that you want us here.

You want every soul here,
right now.

We thank you for this message
that you sending
through all these people.

We thank you for bringing Dave
to bring us together.

We dreamed of this day
and we ask that you
just utilize our souls

and our spirits and our voices
to glorify you
in all that we do.

We don't forget people
that's poor.

We don't forget
those that's at war right now.

We don't forget our comrades
that's in prison.

We don't forget
our children, God.

And we praying
that you can just be
through us and live through us

so that we can raise
our people up
and raise ourselves up.

We put you first in all we do.

And now just bless
the energy of us
and the people out there.

And allow your message
to be through us.

Amen.
Amen.

In the name of Jesus, in the
name of Allah and the Spirit
of the Ancestors, amen, ashe.

DAVE: All these people,
what we all have in common?

I think we all have
a very personal message
that they try to get across.

And it's about more
than just making money.

All these people that have
come here to this concert,
before I ever met them,

I was fans of theirs.

So to work with these people,
in this kind of setting,
it's a dream come true.

This is the concert
I've always wanted to see.

(PERFORMlNG GET 'EM HlGH)

hustlers, busters, boosters,
hoes, everybody, fuck that

Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

Brooklyn

It's your boy, M Def.
Yeah, he back.

Feels good to be home, y'all.

DAVE: This is
my local coffee shop.
The journey starts here.

Preparing for game day,
Saturday.

We got to get some people
to come to this concert.

I don't think
that'll be so hard.

Hey, Bobby,
guess what he offered us?
What?

He said that there's gonna be
a rap concert in Brooklyn

and if we wanna go,
he'll give us tickets.

Man, I can't rap.
Dave, you know better
than that.

You don't have to rap.

But I'll get up there
and try.

All you gotta do is listen.

MAN: What?

How often does a brother
get a chance to chill out
with the probation officers?

On some social stuff.

Man. And some social...
No problems.

I ain't even... I ain't
asking you to turn around,
drop me a cup of urine.

None of that. No cups, man.
DAVE: Yeah.
No peeing in the cup.

It might look like a lot,
but this is it. These are
the golden tickets.

Wee Willy Wonka
didn't even give out
this many.

This will get you guys there.

It'll get you a hotel
in New York for the night.

All right.

And it'll get you
into the concert.
And it'll get you a ride back.

Okay. We get
in our Cadillac like we...
My Cadillac, I should say.

Like we always do.
And we go drive, go golfing.

It's this little corner store
that we always go to
for snacks.

And the next thing we know,
we see Dave Chappelle.

I was like, "Oh!"

Chappelle,
he grabbed this ticket.

Out of nowhere.
He pulled it out his ass.

We was like, "Oh!"

We were like,
"Where did that come from?"

After we got done
seeing Chappelle,
we went on golfing.

And we going on
to the hole number 11.

Just imagine,
we feeling like this high.

Man, we feeling
like this high.

This high.
Top of the world right now.
This top of the world, man.

You can't crush us.
We untouchable.

Can't crush
none of our feelings.

There's a house to the left.

It's deep
over there to the left.

And the tee right here.
He had to take a piss.
So he respected the house.

You know, he respected it.

I was down
into some woods somewhere.

You know,
on some adventure stuff.
And he went on this side.

You know,
he handled his business,
you know.

Right.
Everybody does it
on the golf course.

It's nothing.
Man.

But...

Some guy comes out
and just says,

"You nigger."
I said, "Oh!" I said, "No."

Man.
It's a new era, though.

I thought it was over.
And this old guy
was so old-school.

I never thought
somebody would say "nigger."

I said, "Oh, my."

And then,
I'm up here
just holding him back.

"No. No."
If it wasn't for him,
it'd been over.

'Cause you know, that's his
private property. We want to
go to Chappelle on Saturday.

Chappelle's Show

Chappelle, Chappelle

Yeah, Chappelle's Show

So, we gotta go.

So we did it for you, Dave.
Yeah.

We didn't whoop nobody's ass
for you, Dave.

It was for you, Dave.
For you, Dave. For you.

Watch your back.
You almost bumped into a pole.

I never steer you wrong.
Anyway, I come here
and get cigarettes.

Nice lady, Miss Hall, owns
this place. I had the pleasure
of meeting her before.

I wanna see if she'll come
listen to some rap music.

Just 'cause she's not a
traditional person to
a rap concert. Look out. Pole.

I'm telling you,
I'll never lie to you.

So, you're ready?
Saturday night?
Bring your Timberlands.

All right.

And get the dance.

Do you think I would
enjoy that at my age,
really and truly?

DAVE: And I just wanted
people from around
the area that I live in,

that might not normally go
to something like this...

That's right.

...to get a chance
to experience something
like this.

So, I figure,
I'll go to the store.

I come here,
I buy my cigarettes
sometimes in the morning.

I just wanted you to
be able to come in and
do your business and leave.

So...
No, that's why I live here.

Everybody treats me like...

But inside, I was screaming,
"That's Dave Chappelle!"

(DAVE LAUGHlNG)

Hi.
CAMERAMAN: Hi.

CAMERAMAN:
How's it going? Yeah.
Do you wanna come in?

Come on in.

I really don't know what
to take to a rap party,
Block Party.

I knew I should have
bought a thong.

I'm trying to catch the beat

I need to catch the beat

I got the bounce
like hydraulics

I can't call it,
I got the swerve
like alcoholics

My freshman year,
I was going through
hella problems

Till I built up the nerve
to drop my ass up
out of college

My teacher said I'm a loser,
I told her
why don't you kill me

I give a fuck if you feel me
I'm gonna follow my heart

And if you follow the charts
or the plaques or the stacks

You ain't gotta
guess who's back, you see

I'm so shy
you thought I was bashful

but this bastard's flow
will bash your skull

And I will cut your girl
like Pastor Troy

And I don't usually smoke,
but pass the 'dro

And I won't give you
that money that you asking for

Why you think me
and Dame cool?
We assholes

That's why we hear your music
in fast-forward

'Cause we don't wanna hear
that weak shit no more

Now everybody

Get them high,

And all the girls

I can't believe this nigga

But never mind,
I need some tracks
He trying to pull tracks out

And my rhymes

he about to blow back South

Well, okay,
you twisted my arm,
I'll assist with the charm

Hey, yo, ain't you
meet that chick at the
conference with your mom?

Her sister's the bomb,
but she got
the bougie behavior

Always got something to say
like a Okay Player hater

Anyway, I don't usually
fuck with the Internet

Or chicks with birth control
stuck to their arm
like Nicorette

You really fucking that much
or trying to get off
cigarettes?

And she think it's fly
She ain't met a real nigga yet

I apologize if I come off
a little inconsiderate

I got the Bubba Kush

Get them high,

All the girls pass the weed

Get them high, get them high
Come on, yeah

Now I ain't never tell you
to put down your hands

Get them high, get them high

Old people
fucking love me, man.
They love me.

You know you must be doing
something right
if old people like you.

Hi, miss.
WOMAN: Hi.

Do you like rap music?

I like you, man, I tell you.

I'll take that. You want
to come see a rap concert
I'm throwing?

When?
It's in Brooklyn
on Saturday.

Sorry, I can't do that.

I'll get you on the bus.

I'm going to Canada
on a bus.

Canada? You trying to
dodge the war?

I don't know if you like
rap music, but...

No, it's not a question
of liking.

I don't hear well enough
to catch the words.

You know, I got
the concert jump-off
this weekend.

Oh, do you?
I can get you there.

Hell, yeah.
If you get me there, I'll go.

On a bus.

It don't make
no difference to me.

You'll go?
Yeah.

No matter how
we get you there? I ain't
gonna send you on a donkey.

MAN: He'll hurt the donkey.

I'm a football player.
I'm 320 pounds.

You play football?
Where? At Central?

No. Hell, no.
Oh, excuse me,
I shouldn't be cursing.

Oh, that's all right. Look.
Pussy hole. You see?

You can say anything.
This is a movie.

You got
a big hat for me?
Yeah.

And the mirror's
right here?
Yeah.

That's the one.
All right,
I'm gonna surprise myself.

Here I go. Damn! Oh, snap!

Pimpalicious.

This a bad coat.
Yeah.

You think I can wear this
to a rap concert?

You sure could.

Where is my money, bitch?

Now, this is
the popular stuff?
Yeah.

All right.
This is current styles.

(lMlTATlNG PlMP)
Look here, bitch.

I'm gonna tell you this
and I'm gonna
tell you this once.

I want my goddamn money.

Tell your wife I said hi.
I can't wait to meet her.

What's she like?

She's the shit.
Red hair, big tits.

Red hair and big titties?
All right,
I'll keep an eye out.

Get her drunk,
she'll show them.
Really?

All right, make sure
we have beer at the concert.

This place is called
HaHa's Pizza, right?

Back in the day,
it was started
by some hippies.

And they had certain
pizza toppings that made you
laugh. Get my drift?

You ordered a mushroom pizza
at this place back in '71,

chances were
you were gonna hallucinate.


Brooklyn, make some noise.

I rolled up on you guys
completely by chance.

What are the odds
that I'd be shooting
the beginning?

It's God.
I'm shooting a concert movie.

That's God.
That's God, man.

I'm trying to think,
how am I gonna get
people to come?

And all of a sudden,
a marching band
crosses the street.

How perfect is that?

Now, ladies and gentlemen,

I'm standing here
with a piece of black history.

The first black man
named Milsapp, right here,
ladies and gentlemen.

And not only
is his name Milsapp,
but he's also the director

of Central State University's
band we got here.

This is not any old band
though, is it?

No, it isn't.
This the drum line.

Mr. Milsapp?
Yes.

All right, how do y'all travel
when you travel?

Very carefully.

We travel by charter bus.

By charter bus?

We gotta have a huddle, guys.
Come on, let's huddle up
real quick.

Look, man. All right,
say I chartered y'all
a bus, right?

Would you all come play
at my concert, Block Party,
in New York?

I don't have a problem
with it.
The whole band?

Yeah, yeah,
with two buses, right?
Yeah.

It's not gonna be more
than two buses, is it?

No, it won't be more
than two buses.

Yeah, man, come on,
rep southwest Ohio, man.

Yes, we would.
You'll do it?

Yes, we would.

Is there a compensation,
or what?

Compensation?
It comes with a sandwich.

Will there be snacks?

Oh, there'll be snacks.
We got...

Don't we got snacks
in the budget?
This is a low-budget movie.

You know how Steven Spielberg

have all them trucks
and stuff?
Got the hookup.

DAVE: This is it.
We pulled up
in a minivan, baby.

We're working
on a tight budget.

You have to go through the
channels, right? Run it up the
flagpole, that type of thing.

Yeah, and that would
be done expediently.
That could be done.

And now we're just caught up
in a little bureaucracy.

Now, how hot would it be
if these kids got a chance
to come through Bed-Stuy,

beating them drums,
playing them horns?

The whole neighborhood
is amped, screaming.

They're saying "It's CSU!"
That's what we're hoping for.

The anticipation
is killing me.

This your house?

You know, we're having
a concert in front of your
house Saturday. You excited?

Yes, and you're welcome
to come and rest your loins
at any point.

I can come rest my loins
in the crib, you heard that?

With a glass of champagne.

Ladies and gentlemen,

today is their fortieth...

Sixth.

Forty-sixth
wedding anniversary.
Good God Almighty.

Thank you.
Hold your applause to the end.

We took a trip
on the Staten lsland Ferry,
a little ocean voyage.

Okay.
On the Staten lsland...

All right.
To Staten lsland.

And, as we walked
in the streets
of Staten lsland,

what did we discover
in the gutter, but an angel
broken in seven pieces.

When we both discovered this,

I turned to him,
who was not my husband
at the time,

and I said,
"It's an omen. It's a sign.

"I'm to marry you,
of all people."

Really?
And I did. I married him.

And Sunday is our 46th
wedding anniversary.

I put that angel
back together again.

But after I did, we found
the original, of which there
may be thousands of them.

The original's rather stiff.
Mine is kind of graceful.

So, that's why we call this
Broken Angel.

Because this building
was wrecked and vandalized

and lying in the street.

And I'm putting it
back together again,
better than it was.

CHAPPELLE: On
the actual block,

it's like a warehouse
where they make chairs.

There's, like,
a Salvation Army,

a nursery school.

Then there's this ill house
called the Broken Angel House

that these two people live in.

They've been living there
for 40 years.

Now you guys built
this house yourselves?
We did. We built...

What you see,
that's unusual.

It is quite the unusual home.

It's a monument to
Brooklyn, my dear.

He's my spouse.

It's our anniversary
of marriage on Sunday.

I moved in three months
before we closed.

We had five wild dogs
living in the building
at the time.

(DOG BARKlNG)

That's not one of them.

Her name is Cat,
the one barking.

Cat.

When I say
it's a ill house, like,

this is the craziest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

(ALL LAUGH)

You just...
I couldn't even describe.
You just have to...

And if you get a chance,
go in there as far as you...

Can.
Yeah, exactly.

They're real
hospitable people, like,
"Come on in. "

That was my fault. All right.

I only have seven dogs,
14 cats, two doves
and a parakeet.

Good God.
And a cheetah.

Oh, good God almighty.
Oh, yes.

A cheetah?
A cheetah, honey.

All right,
let's see that last.

Okay, last, of course.
All right.

CHAPPELLE: Keep the cheetah
locked up.

That up ahead is called
the Great Expectation Room.

In there.

Notice the door says Quincy,

because it came from
Quincy Street.

You can peek through there
if you wish to

photograph
the wonderful jumble

of chaotic living.


And in here,

we have an angel sculpture

that my husband did
on the back

inside and outside
of the building.

The building is only
a third completed.

One-third.
We have two-thirds to go.

With a Sea King helicopter

on a climbing crane
that goes through
the entire building,

doesn't touch the building,
the climbing crane.

The Sea King helicopter
is five more stories

above what's there now.

And it is transformed
into a whale.

There's drawings of that
where we're going
on the next level.

You just climb up

this charming, little ladder.

Now we're getting to
the Titanic version.

Only it doesn't sink.


It's slippery for me.

CHAPPELLE: It's an old
white couple.

They've been married for,
like, 40 years,
and they found this house

which they took as a sign.

So they said,
"We will piece
this house together

"better than it was before."

Now I don't know
how it looked before,

(ALL LAUGHlNG)

but I'll tell you this.

They pieced it together,
and that shit literally
is like chutes and ladders

and like the steps are,
like, just, like cat way.

Like it really looks like
some shit that they made.

From where you're standing up,

I built personally...

With me.
...with my wife,

who's a very good
construction worker.

And in the early stages,

I had a couple of men
working for me

that were criminals.

Out of jail.

But they enjoyed
working with me
because I did what they did.

All I told them was,
"Keep up with me,
and I'm twice your age.

"lf you can keep up to me,
you can work here."

You know,
I don't like rap music,

because rap music

composes a lot of
foul language,

and I don't think
it's proper for children.

I don't even think it's proper
for adults, either,

to be using
that type of language.

And that's
what's incorporated.

I grew up in show business.
My father was
a director in Hollywood.

His name was...
MAN: It's not hip-hop.
That's rap.

His name was...
Rap music, yeah.

His name was Russell Mack.

He was a vaudevillian
song-and-dance man.

And I was born in...

They took me home
from the hospital.
I was born in Los Angeles,

and my father built his home
in Beverly Hills.

He wanted to negotiate films
with the Germans.

But when he realized,
when he saw that
they were, "Heil, Hitler, "

and all of that,

of course, that was a no-go.

They got shit in there,
like, there's a hole

that they look through,
like a pipe,

and the pipe is pointing
directly at a clock tower.

So, like, if it's like,
"What time is it?"

(ALL LAUGHlNG)

There's some wild shit
in there.

This is called
the Airplane Room,
what you're in now.

My son named this room
the Airplane Room.

He had a tent.
He lived in a tent. He was 15.

And all the airplanes
flying over to LaGuardia

fly over this building.

What is painted black here

appears to be the bottom.
MAN: Yeah.

So this whole thing floats
over these mirrors.

Whoa!
So from that corner,

it's a very good illusion
in the morning,

because you'll see
clouds underneath it.

Oh, yeah, yeah,
I see what you mean.

And there's nothing up here
to give scale,

so when people walk by,
they ask me
if this is about this big.

You know, from the street,

they don't know how big it is
until I'm up there.

Then they accuse me
of witchcraft.

I want to give
and donate myself
to two endeavors in life.

One is cancer, one is animals.

I intend to take a course
at LaGuardia College

as a veterinary technician.

And between that and my life

isn't as young
as perhaps I may look.

But I intend to live
to probably about 400,

as I am also a witch,
but a good witch.

And I only want happiness
for mankind,

not to create chaos

and to be angry at everyone,

but to be happy around them.

That is my aim in life.

To give happiness
to the world.

Because they bought it,
it kind of had
some sort of meaning.

But if I was a location scout,

and we needed a crack house,
I might refer that place.

MlLSAPP: Can I see
the whole band
for a moment, please?

BOY: Quiet.
GlRL: Be quiet.

All right.

Upon a discussion
I had with our president

and Mr. David Chappelle,

the performances on Saturday
have been canceled.

Are you serious?
I'm serious.

However, there has been
a change in plans.

We will be traveling
to New York.

to the Block Party, won't you?

Attention, Huxtables.

There is
a Block Party jump-off
right around the corner.

Downing and Quincy.
Downing and Quincy.

Bring Rudy, Theo, Denise...

On the actual block?

It's like a warehouse
where they make chairs.

No human ass
has touched these seats yet.

Some lucky person
is gonna get a chair.

DAVE: There's like
a nursery school.

There's this ill house called
the Broken Angel house.

Then there's
the Salvation Army.

These guys have been
kind enough to loan us
furniture for the party.

And now we're just kind
of looking around
at furniture,

so that we can be comfortable
on the rooftop
during the concert.

I'm also just taking some time

to look at all this good stuff
that people just throw out.

If I went to a white person's
house and saw this,
I'd be furious.

Think I can play this,
even though it says
"Do not play"?

(PLAYlNG 'ROUND MlDNlGHT)

Midnight, 'round midnight

QUESTLOVE: I think,
right now, man, Dave has
two songs in his repertoire.

He has Round About Midnight
and Misty.

And he... Once he has...

(PLAYlNG MlSTY ON ORGAN)


Wait, get...

Go back to Round Midnight.

He always gets to the bridge

and then he does
these real
immaculate arpeggios,

which trips me out.

The fact that
he's not a trained musician,

but he's dedicated
his whole life
to Round About Midnight.

BOTH: We're dating.

It's called...
Courtship.

Christian courtship.
That's what it's called.

We're dating.
It's called dating.

We've been friends
for how long? A year.

Best friends for a year.

A month.
And a month.

And a day.
And a day.

And a day, a day.
It's a year,
a month and a day.

So, how many hours
and how many minutes
and how many seconds?

Can I breathe your air?
Breathe mine.

(GlRLS LAUGHlNG)

That was Round Midnight
I was playing.
That's a Thelonious Monk song.

One of my favorite musicians
because his timing was so ill.

Every comedian
is a stickler for timing.

And Thelonious Monk
was off time,
yet perfectly on time.

You should study it
if you're an aspiring comedian

or an aspiring musician,
you should study it.

Which brings me
to my next point.

Comedians and musicians,
we're like this.

Every comic
wants to be a musician.

Every musician
thinks they're funny.

It's a very strange
relationship that we have.

Some musicians are funny,
some comedians can play.

I'll give you an example.
Mos Def, funny guy.

Jamie Foxx,
good singer and piano player.

So you never know.
You never know what kind
of talents a person has.

I'm mediocre at both,
but have managed
to talk my way into a fortune.

Life is a funny,
unpredictable thing.

DAVE: So, you do
the drums, right?

And then do
like the straight...
Like, if I say,

"I saw this lady
who was so fat. "
You'd be like, "Really, Dave?"

Like, "How fat was... "

You do the straight man
and then I'll do...
All right, you ready?

But this is how it works.

That you gotta stop
when I say stop. It's gotta
be, like, on a dime.

Okay.

And then keep going again.
Stop, keep going again.

All right.
All right,
so we'll try it out.

But when we do it,
we're gonna practice it
in front of the audience.

This shit never fails.
It's like a walking bassline,

and then like a swing beat,
and then like whatever else...

MAN: This is sort of like
making that noise.

All right. That's right.
Okay, it should be like this.

Hey, Mos, what's happening?

Then you be like...
Hey, what's happening, Dave?

Mos, I'm gonna tell you
a little...

How many white people
does it take to screw in
a light bulb?

I don't know, Dave, how many?

None. 'Cause they'll get
a nigga to do it for them.

Carry on.

Oh, that's right.

Just a little warm-up.

All right, all right.

MlLSAPP: Okay, listen up.

Upon getting your keys
and your luggage,

you can go to your room.

We are going to eat down here,
I believe, in the dining room.

So once you
put your luggage up,
you can come back downstairs.

Glad we're here, though.

Time to relax, get some
sleep before we go and
kick it tomorrow or whatever.

Original caveman,

Express my desire

These record executives

What, are they what?

Shut the fuck up!

Revolutionaries,

Whether you a bougie broad

Or some ignorant

shooting the club up

We make y'all feel this,
break your spirit

If y'all fake that realness,
Word, bringing it

Ringing it in
from the new millennium
to way after that

I call these cats Reynolds
'cause they plastic rap

Kill all the yapping,
let's make it happen

You cats ain't real,
you just a reenactment

Better yet, dramatization

Soon as the director
say action
you start faking

DAVE: I like the element
of surprise.

Take this concert
for instance.

I would have loved it
if nobody saw it coming.

Now it got leaked
to the press,
people have heard about it,

but they still don't know
where it is.

So imagine. There's gonna be
a group of people
that see it here,

and then, people will hear
about it, but they have no
idea what it looks like.

CAMERAMAN:
How'd you find out about this?

We're going to Brooklyn.
We're going to Bed-Stuy.

Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy.

Do or die,

That's where we think
we're going.

Just get on. Enjoy yourself.
Have a good time. We love you.

MAN: There's no...
Y'all got to squeeze,
I'm sorry.

Put three people.
People with small booties
all sit together.

Big booty people,
y'all got to share

Wow, how you gonna catch me
while I'm in the middle

This is not a stereotype.
We were hungry and Pathmark
was out of steak.

MAN: You guys ready

ALL: Yeah!

DAVE: Thank you,
thank you very much.

Have you tried the hot dogs?
That's right.


We're gonna have
a little party tonight

And some jazz comedy

Oh

That's right


We didn't get here
until very late last evening.

And we've only had about four
or five hours' sleep,
most of us.

So we are a little tired,
but we're trying

and enjoy ourselves

Carry on!

Yeah! We're gonna
bring the house down tomorrow.

Oh, shit!

We need to let them in.
We gotta go.

only Jesus could save us

Well, Mama,
I know I act a fool

But I'll be gone till November

I hope Jesus walks

God show me the way

to break me down

Jesus walk with me

The only thing that I pray
is that my feet

I want Jesus

And I don't think

'Cause we're the almost

We rappers is role models
We rap, we don't think

I ain't here to argue

Or here to convert atheists

I'm just trying to say
the way school need teachers

The way Kathie Lee
needed Regis
That's the way I need Jesus

So here go my single, dawg
Radio needs it

Nigga, you can rap
about anything
except for Jesus

That means guns,
sex, lies, videotape

But if I talk about God
my record won't get played

Well if this take away
from my spins

Which will probably take away
from my ends

Then I hope it take away
from my sins

And bring the day
that I'm dreaming about

Next time I'm in the club
everybody screaming out

Jesus walks

God show me the way
The devil's trying
to break me down

Jesus walk with me

The only thing that I pray

Man, that Kanye West.

Kanye West,
who we came to see,

He came out, did his thing.

I liked that.

It's Mexican.

For all my compaòeros

This means ya basta.

Yeah.

So if I see some Mexicans

And this means...
Ya basta.

Ya basta. And they'll be

Oh, well, you know.
I never really...
Check with them first.

Yeah, I don't wanna...
Don't have me doing this.

Don't just walk up to Mexicans

I refuse to be a stereotype

Never wanna try

DAVE: I think, like,
the more you say with it,

the less airplay you get.

You know, guys like Dead Prez,
they say it all.

But you hardly ever
hear them on the radio.

Because they say things like,

"The White House
is the rock house.

"Uncle Sam is
the motherfucking pusher man.

"What I gotta do
to make you understand?"

You know.

They don't want to hear that
on the radio.

"The White House
is the rock house,"
and all these kinds of things.

But you hear it
at the barber shop
all the time.

Say turn off the radio,
Brooklyn

Turn off that bullshit

Come on, come on
Turn off that bullshit

What's on the radio

And turning it on is like

it's part of their plans

To make us think
it's all about

when you spitting your rap

But in reality,
don't nobody live like that

You wanna know
what kind of nigga I am?

Let me tell you

I don't fuck with the cops

Like it gotta be hot

I ain't gotta love it,
even if they play it a lot

How many people they reach?
How they use music to teach?

Don't sleep, 'cause you could

Or how about when they say,

"Who shot Biggie Smalls?
If we don't get them,
they gonna get us all. "

"I'm up for running up
on them crackers
in their city hall. "

You'll never hear that shit
on the radio.

Never in a million years
will you hear somebody
say on the radio,

"I'm up for running up on
some crackers in city hall."

And

people have stopped asking
who shot Biggie Smalls.

But if you in show business
and black, you'll wonder
about that every day.

'Cause they might
get you, too.

Biggie Smalls was
in this daycare center.

Miss Jenkins, Miss Green,

Miss Pennick
was their teachers.

And they're still here.
They've been here
for the past 30 years.

Man. So the next Biggie Smalls
might be here now.

You don't even know.
He may be.

That's it. This is what
I just finished telling you.

All right. All right.
Okay.

So out of here,
you will get the next

star. Maybe...
Maybe Biggie Smalls.

...another Biggie Smalls.

This the old daycare center
right here, man.

DAVE: You were in here, too?

No, I didn't go here,
though my little nephew
used to go here.

I used to always come here
to pick up my nephew.

One of my niggas
from Junior MAFlA,
his mom used to work in here.

Word?
You know,
just all around the way, man.

All down here.

So the whole Junior MAFlA's
from around this way?

Yeah. Yeah, everybody.
Kim, everybody.

Yeah, Kim used to live...

She lived
on the other St. James.

That's two blocks
down this way on Lafayette.

Jay-Z, he from Marcy projects.

That ain't but about
two, three blocks
on that side.

Junior MAFlA, Big, he's two
blocks back down this way,
you know what I'm saying?

So, I mean, you know,

we kind of
put it down ourselves.

You influenced
the whole world.

Yeah, yeah.
For sure, for sure.

It's just like it's a 'hood
thing, man. Like we ain't got
shit to do out here.

That's all you got to do,
is music, man.

That was something that kept
a lot of us niggas
out of trouble.

Kept motherfuckers
off the corner.

Would have been police
out there fucking with you.

You go in the crib,
you listen to some music.

That's the only thing
that kind of cleared
the nigga head.

And the money
never came between you?

No, never that. Never that.

'Cause we all
grew up together.

At the end of the day,
I ain't gotta make
another record no more,

but those will always
be my niggas,
'cause I grew up with them.

It was way bigger
than hip-hop.

Kind of like,
that was our work.

Those were my niggas
right there.
I grew up with them

since we was like this,
so nothing would ever
come between us.

You know what I'm saying?

Me, on the other hand,
I don't see
none of my old friends.

Them motherfuckers is crazy.

And if you watching this,
I mean that shit.

If you know this here, say it.
