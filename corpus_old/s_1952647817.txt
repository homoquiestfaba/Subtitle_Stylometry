PIRATES

Oh God, Isabel

I can not begin to tell you how good I feel right now

"I love the perfection, I must admit, I'm nervous

Nervous?, We should not be nervous

Is it true that the Caribbean Sea is full of pirates?

Yes, but would not let a pirate in sight or sound yours

You are very sexy

I can not wait to see your body

Already, we're married

You'll see it soon

But there is something

What if he told you, you decide that you do not like?

Then I must sell you a pirate as a sex slave

I think it's worth a few gold coins

You're a fool

What? "Seriously

You're my wife now and forever, nothing will change that

I love you for all you are

Everything you're not and all that will be

Thanks love

Thank God. Divine Perfection

We are close and she has no sign that we have seen

Good job, keep surfing as a soft ball

If Captain

Nothing ... my love back to sleep

Where you going honey?

I'll breathe the sea air, and back

"Manuel, you ever seen a night so divine?

In all my years at sea he had never seen such serenity

God has blessed us with peace tonight

Definitely yes

How long before we get to Caribbean waters?

"We'll not later than the morning - So fast?

If we lose the calm breeze, and if it increases, get ...

... Before the sun rises. Still, I'll take safe

No doubt it has always sailed fast and careful

Thanks friend

Perhaps it is cold without you

He's right captain. Good night

How is the sea air? "The only air I want ...

... Is breathing your breath

I love you so

When I have my treasure, I'll give you everything you want

It brings together sailors on the bow, and bring me down passengers

And Sarina ... Although I love you so, do not consider

What are you doing?

If you let it go I'll do what you want

There is no need for something so violent

Silence

Hello, my name is Captain Victor Stagnetti

I apologize for any inconvenience that we ...

Pirates ... they've caused, we are pirates

Sadly this is our way of being

Usually this would end with people like you beheaded

For the head you eat sharks, but this

... Has to happen if I get what I want

What do you want?

Captain's Log, August 26, 1763

It has been four long weeks without seeing land

The sailors are impatient and discouraged

I try to motivate and teach them how to fight ...

.. With swords, but soon tire

Somehow, the First Lady, Jules keeps them ...

... The moral high ground. As it does not, I have no idea

Many men do not articulate a lot and she's ...

... Help you improve your oral or fighting attributes. More ...

... Night I hear noises from the cockpit, which can only be ...

... Be produced by his devotion

At least we know that the good Lord be with us ...

... On our trip, but there are many more problems later

Food supplements are quite low and I fear ...

... We have to return to port again. I have wanted ...

... From pirates to face but the truth, I'm worried ...

Chang Woo because you can not make new guns ...

... Shoot very well. Each time the cannon fired smells ...

... A goat's tail. Woo believes that the powder you need more potassium ...

... And less sulfur

The bad news is that we do not have potassium

The same fight with the pirates with swords or hand ...

... To the death if necessary. I feel at ease ...

... Knowing that soon manage to find something. At the call ...

... Action, my crew you want thrown out. We are men ...

... And women in cold blood, we fear hackers. I fear to me ...

Edwards Captain Reynolds. Captain of the "sea horse"

"Edward," Excuse me, is the captain

And he has said clearly not want to be interrupted. Just ...

... When we are under attack, and careful, "Okay, I speak ...

... With the commander-is necessary to complete the log.

"Okay, they apologized. Later continue

I suggest you to report immediately to the bow

Yes

Captain

Oxford was right, you should not bother me. As a captain ...

... Of "sea horse" is my work with all protocols are ...

... Followed exactly. And as captain of the ship I have to ...

... Make sure my orders are followed exactly

As captain it is my responsibility to the rules ...

... Are respected. Edward, for the charade.

What happens?

I'm a bad captain, I can not hunt pirates, or even ...

... I can hunt one. The crew hates me - What do you mean?

You dreaming of this since we were children

I'm a bad commander, we have not seen a boat

pirate in four weeks, four weeks!

Your father was right, I should have stayed on the plantation ...

... Snuff, helping to harvest it

-No. S lost faith in you ...

If true, had never previously been in a boat ...

... Like this. Is it true you've never been in combat ...

... With a man or a pirate. I really do not know is the sea ...

... But you have a dream and that is stronger than any ...

... Wisdom or experience. It is your destiny

What if this is not my destiny? What if this is not my dream?

You can "what" your whole life and die peacefully in a ...

... Warm bed or you can make your life worth and prevent ...

... That the pirates make others suffer as they do

Let's see what our fate has in store for us

Where are they? "For the bow.

I see nothing.

There's something floating in the water.

I see nothing, check the lights of the dead, Oxford.

There is someone floating in the wood.

Man in the water.

Hampton, takes the boat has the remains. "Yes master, we are already.

Help me carry it inside.

Okay, you're safe.

Are you okay? "Yes, just a little disoriented.

Take care. Drink this, will help you relax.

My name is Captain Edward Reynolds and you're safe ...

... In my boat, "El Caballo Marino" - Are pirates?

"Pirates, no. Well, I, what ... "We're hunting pirates.

Thank God, I thought I would die.

"You're safe here. "That's what Manuel said.

Who is Manuel? "My husband.

Was your ship attacked by pirates? -Si. We just ...

... Married in Spain. We went to the island of Seville.

"He was my family. "Sorry.

"Sorry. "We were attacked by pirates.

Then the pirate captain told my husband that

take out the face and reveal, but Manuel did not.

"And I dived into the water. - Do you remember his name?

"I think I said his name was Victus. "Stagnetti.

Who is it? "It is a personification of ...

... All that is wrong. "We must find him.

"You may be in the middle of the ocean now. "Like, we ...

... Find it. But first, we need to supplement e. ..

... Information before starting the search. We go to ...

... Sorscabra Island. - Where?

It is a small island along the coast, which protects thieves ...

... Murderers and pirates of the Caribbean.

"I must talk to you about something. - Captain can ...

... Speak in private? "I want to rest secure Isabela ...

... Knowing that you're safe here in my boat.

Do you think Manuel is alive? "No but if this, what ...

... Find. "Thanks.

What happened? "You condemn us ...

in this place. Can not we start with a pirate ...

... Less experienced?

If we beat Victor Stagnatti. all the pirates terrorized. Think about it.

"Think what the world would write. - Really?

What would you say? "The papers say ...

... "Captain Reynolds, save the world of pirates murderers"

Is it possible? "If it's possible.

Really? "I would be after ...

... How beautiful you are. "Yes, I look good in these clothes.

-Write your bravery. "Yes, I watch the death of their ...

... Eyes and grabbed his testicles. "And read the love he ...

... Got all creatures. "I love so much sometimes it hurts.

"And women. - What?

"Women. "Yes, women will run to you ...

... For comfort and safety. "I, I have strong arms.

Evil has no chance against these two cannons fire.

What, you're with me my friend?

Yes, now and forever. "Captain Reynolds, hunting pirates"

Faithful crew of "sea horse" I'll take a ...

... Tremendous day. The eye of the danger, a journey which ...

... Some or most would not return. 'll Hunt y. ..

... Kill the most dangerous pirates. Captain ...

... Victor Stagnetti and his ship called "La Rosa Del Diablo"

I have spoken with you about the hazards were found ...

... On this day. But this is an evil like no other.

Woo, Oxford did not blame if you do not want to follow me.

They are my friends now and forever.

Those who want to join me to take a giant step forward.

Remember that all will be well rewarded for my husband ...

... When this is over.

Well done.

"Commander, we sail to the island. "Yes, Captain.

-Crew, get ready! - If Captain!

"Well said, Captain. "Thank you Commander.

What are we doing? "For now sail.

But when the time comes, do what is necessary.

Crew, at full speed. A Sorscabra Island.

I can feel his power begging. We are close ...

... Good place to throw the anchor. "If a captain.

Yes, Captain. Crew, get ready to pull anchor ...
