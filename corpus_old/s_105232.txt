What should I tell Travis?
Nothing. You're staying here.

No. General... Sam.
I gave my word!

That's an order.

Dig her deep, boys.

Dig her deep.

Dig her deep.

Good work, boys.

Always good to have a fall-back position.

About the size of a grave,
ain't it, Cap?

Captain Dickinson...

I'm reassigning you and Private Esparza
to the battery at the rear of the church

so you can be near your families.

And I've arranged for a replacement
for your midnight watch.

Thank you, sir.

Gracias.

Here you go, son.

So, Davy,

in all your Indian fightin',
you ever get into a scrape like this?

I was never in but one real scrape
in my life, feller.

Yeah, but you was in the Red Stick War.
Yeah, it's true. I was in that.

I sure was.

I was just about your age when it broke out.

The Creeks boxed up
about 400 or 500 people at Fort Mims

and massacred every one of'em.

Of course, this was big news around those
parts, so I up and joined the volunteers.

I did a little scoutin', but mostly...

I just fetched in venison for the cookfire,
things of that nature.

Well, we caught up with those redskins
at Tallushatchee,

surrounded the village,
come in from all directions.

Wasn't much of a fight, really.
We just shot 'em down like dogs.

Finally...

what Injuns was left,
they crowded into this little cabin.

They wanted to surrender.

But this squaw, she loosed an arrow
and killed one of the fellers,

and then we shot her.

And then we set the cabin on fire.

We could hear 'em screamin'
for their gods in there.

We smelled 'em burnin'.

We'd had nary to eat
but parched corn since October.

And the next day,
when we dug through the ashes,

we found some potaters
from the cellar.

They'd been cooked by that grease
that run off them Indians.

And we ate till we nearly burst.

Since then...

you pass the taters,
I'll pass 'em right back.

He's been stabbed three times,

once through the lungs,

shot two or three times.

Cholera, malaria, every two years.

He is already dead.

And this is the place he has been sent.

We got riders!

Pull back.
Riders on the way!

Colonel Travis.
Congressman Crockett.

I figure this is just about
every able-bodied man in Gonzales, sir.

Those soldados.
they think they got it all sewed up.

But you avoid the roads, there's this
little sliver you can just ease on through.

And Colonel Fannin is behind you?

He ain't here?

I talked to him three days ago in Goliad.
That son of a bitch said he'd be here.

How many rode with you?

Brung ya 32 good men, sir.

And if it ain't the prettiest bunch
of Texians I ever seen.

Let's hear it for Gonzales, boys!

Excelencia...

Come on!

Fight!

You're yellow!

We're waitin'!

You look better.

Thank you for tending to me.

And now I want you to leave.

Sam...

You, too.

You giving me my papers, Mr. James?

No. You're my property till I die.

And when I get up off my back,
I'm gonna come fetch ya.

For now I want you both to go.

Santa Anna ain't gonna
make that offer twice.

No. She was my sister.

You loved her.
Her blood was yours.

Your blood is mine.

We're family.

The men need a word from you.

I...

I don't know what to tell them.

My time in Washington,

the fellas in Congress
made a good deal of sport of me.

I learned an awful lot from 'em.

Learned how to dress,
to a certain degree,

what fork to use in polite company,
things like that.

I was never afraid to stretch things a bit.

But I never learned to lie.

These people in here
been through an awful lot.

And I would allow that
they've earned the right to hear the truth.

I have here pieces of paper,

letters from politicians and generals,

but no indication of when,
or if, help will arrive.

Letters not worth the ink
committed to them.

I fear that...

no one is coming.

Texas has been a second chance for me.

I expect that might be true
for many of you as well.

It has been a chance
not only for land and riches,

but also to be a different man.

I hope a better one.

There have been many ideas
brought forth in the past few months

of what Texas is

and what it should become.

We are not all in agreement.

But I'd like to ask each of you

what it is you value so highly

that you are willing to fight
and possibly die for.

We will call that Texas.

The Mexican army hopes to
lure us into attempting escape.

Almost anything seems better
than remaining in this place, penned up.

If, however,
we force the enemy to attack,

I believe every one of you
will prove himself worth ten in return.

We will not only show the world
what patriots are made of,

but we will also deal a crippling blow
to the army of Santa Anna.

If anyone wishes to depart...
under the white flag of surrender,

you may do so now.

You have that right.

But if you wish to stay here,
with me, in the Alamo,

we will sell our lives dearly.

Leave it.

The light. I want the light.

What troubles you, Buck?

I spoke to the men earlier about our
situation. You deserve to hear it as well.

I heard, through the door, every word.

My words.
How painful for you.

Good words.

Good words.

We could try to get you out with an escort.

If you're captured, perhaps, given
your condition, mercy would be extended.

I don't deserve mercy.

I do deserve a drink.

You got anything stronger than water?
I don't drink, Jim. You know that.

I gamble, go to whores,
run off on wives.

But drinkin'...
I draw the line.

You know, you live another five years,
you just might be a great man.

I think I will probably have to settle
for what I am now.

Buck...

Did it matter?

I'll see about fetchin' you a bottle.

God, I despise that tune.

I just figured it out.

Figured out what?

What it's missin'.

Take cover, boys!

Crockett.

It's amazing what a little harmony'll do.

Well, isn't that something?

Dearest Mary.

I hope someone with a kind voice
is reading this to you.

If you could see. you'd know
how beautiful this land- our home - is.

Kiss all six children for me.
and kiss them again.

The scarcity of paper. together with
other difficulties I've had to labor under.

has prevented me from writing before this.

and. indeed. it is a matter of claim

whetherthis letter
will ever reach the United States.

Please remember me to my father

and tell him to think of nothing but of
coming to this fair country when it is free.

I go the whole hog
in the cause of Texas.

I expect to help them
gain their independence

and to also form their civil government.

for it is worth risking many lives for.

From what I have seen
and learned from others.

there is not so fair a portion
of the earth's surface warmed by the sun.

We know what awaits us.
and we are prepared to meet it.

My respects to all friends.
confusion to all enemies.

God bless you.

Take care of my little boy.

General Cos...

Coronel Duque...

Romero...

Morales...

General Castrillon...

Get down! Get down.

Micajah.

They've killed me, David. I...

I'm real sorry about all this.

Expliquele.

Throw yourself
on the mercy of His Excellency,

Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

Are you San-tanna?

I thought he'd be taller.

Davy Crockett.

You tell the general

that I'm willing to discuss
the terms of surrender.

You tell him,

if he'll tell his men to lay their weapons
down and assemble peacefully,

I promise to take you all
to General Houston,

and I'll try my best
to save most of your lives.

That said, Sam's a might prickly.

So no promises.

Tell him.

Tell him!

Excelencia...

Excelencia!

I wanna warn you all...

I'm a screamer.

Aaarghhh!

Burn it all!

Burn this barn!

Burn it down.
Don't leave nothin' for the Mexicans.

Move, move, move!

Coronel Morales...

General Gaona...

How far east do we have to run
before we're safe?

You keep retreating, we have to, too.

Gimme one good reason why
we don't just dig in right here and fight.

"Sir, the enemy are laughing you to scorn."

"You must fight them.
You must retreat no further."

"The country expects you to fight."

"The salvation of the country
depends on your doing so."

"Signed, David G.Burnet, President."

The man's spineless. How far do we intend
to follow this traitor away from battle?

It's time to fight, boys.

Break camp.

We continue east.

They massacred our brothers,
and we're runnin'?

They have to pay.

If not now, you tell me when.

Break camp!

Let's go.

Sam, if we keep running,
you will lose your army.

20-odd years ago,

Napoleon returns from exile in Elba,

puts together an army
and moves east, swiftly,

before an alliance of nations can occur.

Wellington,

with fewer men, fewer armaments,

stays one step ahead of the French,

teasing them with his presence,

knowing that a large army
will have to splinterto keep up.

He moves and waits.

moves and waits
for Napoleon to make a mistake.

to fall into a scenario
that condemns him to defeat.

Wellington chooses the setting for victory

before it exists for him,
before he lays eyes on it.

It has an open battleground.

a sloping plain.

coverfor encampment.

and an opportunity to flank the enemy.

The Mexican army is splintered,
and though they do not know it,

Santa Anna's troops
subsist on gasps of air and sips of hope.

I share Wellington's battleground vision,

though I do not know
the name of the place that I imagine.

I, sir, do not consider myself Wellington.

Santa Anna, however, does consider
himself to be the Napoleon of the West.

We shall move and wait
until he makes a mistake

and presents us with his own Waterloo.

Stay back, everybody. Stay back.

Bring him here.

Water!

Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

Water!

Escucha. Escucha.

Deaf captured a Mexican courier.

His letters tell us that Santa Anna's nearby
and separated from the rest of his army.

General...

Left! Left, march!

Attention!

Back to back. Stay sharp.

Bayonets!

Ready!

March!

March!

Do you have a name?

There is a bridge behind the Mexican line.

Send Deaf Smith and his men to burn it.

Captain Seguin.

You and your men shall guard the camp.

There could be confusion out there.
Men shooting any Mexican they see.

General, you ordered me to stay,
and I stayed.

But this is our fight, too.

You shall join Sherman on the left flank.

Two blades per man!

Company, shoulder arms!

You will remember this battle,

remember each minute of it,

each second,

till the day that you die.

But that is for tomorrow, gentlemen!

For today,

remember the Alamo!

The hour is at hand!

Form ranks!

Battalion, halt!

Fire!

Fire!

March!

Remember the Alamo!

Forward guns! Fight!

Remember the Alamo!

iA la batalla. tejanos!

Dig the plot, boys.
Kill them all!

Let's kill him and be done with it.
Yeah!

I say we hang him from this very tree.

Yeah! Hang him!

Hang him!

No.

You'll settle for blood.

I want Texas.
