THIS IS NOT THE TALE OF IMPRESSIVE DEEDS
IS A PIECE OF TWO LIVES TAKEN IN A MOMENT
WHEN THEY WERE CRUISING TOGETHER ALONG A GIVEN PATH
WITH THE SAME IDENTITY OF ASPIRATIONS AND DREAMS
Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, 1952

<i>The Plan:  To travel 8 thousand kilometers in four months</i>

<i>The method: Improvisation</i>

<i>Objective: Explore the Latin American continent
that we only know by books</i>

motorcycle diaries

Good Night Granado

<i>Equipment: "La Poderosa" (The Powerful)</i>

<i>A '39 Norton 500 that's battered and leaks</i>

<i>The Pilot: Alberto Granado</i>

<i>A chubby friend, 29 years old and biochemist </i>

<i>self proclaimed scientific vagabond</i>

<i>The Pilot's dream: crown the trip with he's 30th birthday</i>

<i>Copilot: That would be me</i>

<i>Ernesto Guevara de la Serna</i>

<i>"El Fuser", 23 years old</i>

Ernesto is going away?
No, Ernesto stays

Ernesto, could you takes us with you, please

Look dad, I'm sorry, but no matter how
many times you tell me...

Please Ernesto, you are only 3 assignments
away from your MD title

And that can wait

<i>MD student</i>

<i>Leprosy specialist</i>

<i>Amateur Rugby player</i>

Hey Fuser...nice Fuser!

<i>And occasionally, asthmatic</i>

Departure date... January 4th

<i>The route: from Buenos Aires to Patagonia
and then Chile</i>

<i>then to the north up to 6 thousand meters
by the spine of the Andes to Machu Picchu</i>

<i>From there, to the lepers home of San Pablo
in the Peruvian amazonia</i>

<i>Final Destination: the Peninsula of Guajira in Venezuela
at the north point of the continent</i>

We settle at the Peninsula of Guajira, the point of this great continent

Mouths full of wine, nice music

That beer is good, ah?

Fuser, on January 4th, you should be done with all your exams, right?
Yes

If you want, i can make a detour to Miramar to visit your little girlfriend
"little girlfriend"

A couple of days

Look Fuser, look at that guy over there
What?

Do you want your life to be like that?

You don't want your life to be like that, Fuser

What you want is to fuck in every country in South America

Hey boy...and in every town if we are lucky enough
That's and extra ingredient, right

<i>What we had in common: our restlessness, our dreaming spirit</i>

<i>and the untiring love for the route</i>

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA
January 4th, 1952
Km 0

Let's go Ernestito, we don't have the whole day

Isn't it too much Granado?
Not enough chief.  Norton 500, "this" is a motorcycle

Your son is in good wheels, don't worry

You should expect some difficult times son

But the truth is that i always dreamed of doing something like this

And i have to confess that if i had a couple less years on me...
I would jump right along with you on that motorcycle

Try to think that i do it for the both of us

10 years planning this trip, uncle
Since you were a kid

Meanwhile...I trust you eh?

And the revolution uncle, for when?

Here? In a century

Are you already leaving?
Yes, I’m off

You should only worry about taking your medicines, nothing more, ok?

And writing me...

The most beautiful letters you have ever read mom

Bye, my love
You'll see. Bye. I love you

Bye

Bye little sister, take care

Bye man

Send me postcards

Ok, stop it or I’ll start crying. Please

Take care, ok?

Just like Don Quixote had Rocinante and Saint Martin had his mule

We have "La Poderosa"

Yeah, that pisses oil
Yes, pisses oil, but what I’m trying to say is that
in this precise moment

The young Fuser and myself are embarking in a trip
to the most remote places of the human spirit

where we will meet new lands, listen to new anthems, eat new fruits...

Granado...I’m making you responsible. If something happens to Ernesto I’ll find you.
Put on the handkerchief darling

Don't worry mam, he will come back to become
the doctor we all want him to be

It better be

Ok, is time to leave!

Animal!

Careful with that bike!

<i>Dear mom...Buenos Aires is behind us</i>

<i>behind is as also the miserable life</i>

<i>the faculty, the exams and the dissertations that make you sleepy</i>

<i>Before us lies all of Latin America</i>

<i>From now on we will only trust in "La Poderosa"</i>

<i>I wish you could see us. We look like adventurers
and inspire admiration and envy everywhere</i>

Go Mial. Assume aerodynamic road position

C'mon baby, don't fail me baby.
C'mon, c'mon

What happened Mial?!

<i>I'm glad to have left behind civilization, and be closer to the earth</i>

Wait, something is coming out...something is coming out

Fuser, are you alright?

What happened puppy?

Are you alright?

What the fuck is that?
What the fuck does it look like?

A fucking dog?!
 Oh fuck, you are a shitty driver...

What the fuck is that dog doing on the bike?

Is for Chichina and his name is Kamba

Pick up the bike.

Miramar, Argentina
January 13th, 1952
Km 601

Where the fuck are we? Switzerland?

Good morning
Good morning

Chichina?
She's inside with the rest of the family

That bike is giving you problems, uh?

Esteban, please tell us about your trip

It was great Don Horacio,
i had the opportunity to take a seminar in Cambridge

and stay a couple of weeks in London,
a fascinating city

What a privilege!
Yes it was

 Esteban is getting his PhD soon, right?
Yes

Medicine?
No, Law

Ah, law

Sorry.

1, 2, 3, 4

Is your turn, come

I never saw a pig who wanted to dance, never.

C'mon

Knock it off!

With this hand...back...side
What are you laughing at?
I'm laughing at you.

Tonight?

My dad ask aunt Roxanna not to take her eyes off of me

My mom promised the Lady of the Valley that she would
walk to her sanctuary if we broke up

And your parents can't see that the more they bury the diamonds,
the more decided is the pirate to steal them?

Believe me, this diamond wouldn't mind being stolen

Dance

Look

Let me see your bathroom

Good night
Good night ladies

Aunt Roxanna, which room is mine?

Get away Kamba!

How many days did you say we were staying here?
You already know
Two

And how many days have we been here?
If you become a Doctor, will you operate with wire too?
Six days, Fuser

Someone will see us

If you'd stay we could do many things, Ernesto,
but only if you'd stay

I didn't like the sound of that

What do you want me to say? That I’m going to wait for you?
I told you I’m coming back

Yes, i have the dog as proof
You didn't like it?

What do you want Ernesto, what do you want to hear?
That I’m going to wait forever,
that I’ll wait for months and months till you come back?

What's going on?
What do you want? What do you want?

I'd like you to stay like this forever. Quiet.

I want to look at you, cause I’m not going
to see you for a long time

Of course I’m going to wait for you,
but please don't take an eternity

And how long is an eternity?
That's slippery ground mister

I'm not going to touch you

Did i hit you? Did i hurt you? Did i hurt you?
That was a trick, a very bad trick

Ok lovebirds...is time to leave.
Fuser

Miss Ferreira...
Thanks for everything

<i>"I used to listen the bare feet splashing in the ship
"And had a feeling of the faces darkened by hunger</i>

<i>"My heart was a pendulum between her and the street</i>

<i>"I don't know with what strength i freed myself from her eyes,
"I broke away from her arms</i>

<i>"She was left clouding with tears her anguish
"Behind the rain and the glass</i>

Lorca eh?
No

Neruda
No

Who?
I don't remember

Good bye
Bye

Wait, wait. The snot is...

And so...with Chichina, nothing...

Not even after giving her the German shepherd with pedigree...nothing

I mean, at least you saw a tit...one

Ahhh....You saw her tits, Ernesto

Scalpel, Scalpel

North American Dollars?

Fifteen
Chichina?
Yes

I like that girl for you, i always said that she was your girlfriend.
We will eat better now

No...
Protein food

No, she gave me this money for when we get to the US.
She asked me to buy her some pants.

I told her i would

What?
Forget about this money. It is out of our budget.

Fucking moron, he is testing me...
 Che are you talking to the bike again

Listen to me man, what is wrong with your head?
That chick's got you by the balls.

Calm down

Good evening
Hi

Piedra de Águila, Argentina
January 29th, 1952
Km 1809

How do you feel the bike?
The wire is making wonders, it works great

Son of a bitch...fuck

Are you alright Fuser?

It was the curve

Son of a...

Look at the pipe...
son of a bitch!

Pass the stakes, I’m all out

Wait, wait, don't fuck with me

You had to choose this place, you idiot...
No you chose this place

Hold that side

No...fuck
Son of a...

The river is taking it
Grab it, grab it

It took it

Che and what if we go there?
We should ask for help over here, with the common people

Which one are we doing? The broken headlight?
No, Red October. You have the experience right?

Good Night

What do you want

Maybe our appearance doesn't show it, but we are doctors
from Buenos Aires and Córdoba, respectively

We are traveling all over the country, doing some research
with hopes of curing some of the worst diseases of the 20th century

Plagues that not only consume our energy but that also
keeps Argentina in need

When by just reading the medical literature, you could notice, just as us...

What the fuck do you want, pair of bums?

Look sir, the wind took our tent, we are starving
and we need a place to spend the night

Ok, out there in the shed there's a good ground.
You can sleep with the workers

We are doctors...
Hmm...i like your face a lot, but i don't like yours fatty

Fine?
Yes, its fine
Thank you.

<i>Dear Mom...we are still hitting the road,
but to tell you the truth, the bike is less powerful every day</i>

San Martín de los Andes, Argentina
January 31st, 1952
Km 2051

<i>Money and food are scarce, but we manage to find opportunities
to eat and sleep for free</i>

<i>Thanks to our secret weapon:
Alberto's infallible sweet talking</i>

...plagues that not only consume our energy but compromise
the modernization of Argentina

So, you are doctors
Well, no. Alberto is a biochemist and I am an MD student
He is practically graduated, we are like doctors

Then i would appreciate it if you could look at a swelling i have in the neck
Gladly, eh...Mr.?

Von Puttkamer

Does it hurt?

This is a tumor
What do you mean a tumor?
Yes

Do you think so
Yes
Allow me

I don't know Fuser, fat sedimentation
it could be a cyst

No.  It is a tumor in the occipital area

Schatzie, these gentlemen say i have a tumor
Tumor?

Good morning mam, i sincerely don't believe it is a tumor
but a sebaceous cyst

If you could give us a place where we could
eat and sleep we might be able to treat it

No, no look...we can't treat it. You will have to go
to Buenos Aires. I can recommend you a specialist

Or we could try to help him, don't you think?
Help with what? With the grass, with prayers?

I understand, you can't do anything for me
Yes we can, if you give us a place where we could eat and sleep.

Around here there's a lake with lots of fish and a shed
Sir, the diagnostic is very...
We have nothing more to talk about, doctors. Let's go Schatzie

The next time could you try to help us a little
Of course i can give you a hand, but never at the price of the health of a man

Ok, let's say that you are right and the old guy has a tumor,
how the fuck do you tell him like that?

Is the truth, if he can't handle it he can go to hell

You can't treat a patient like that, you can't
The guy has a serious problem,
the sooner he looks into it the better

That's the proper treatment, didn't they teach you that
at biochemistry school?

Don't talk to me about proper medicine

Nurse. First graduate and then talk.
You think you know everything, moron

I'm going to look for food

Duck! duck! duck!. Give me gun, move it! move it!

Son of a...

Great Mial...

I hit it, man

How did you do it?
I can't fucking believe it...

Well, there's no other choice but to get in the water
and pick up dinner, no?  Fuser, to the water to get the food!

You are really crazy if you think I’m going to get in there.
Do you know how cold is that water?

Yes, i know you are allergic to cold, water, hot and all that
but you know what, i am older, wiser and i shot the duck, so
you have to go

That shot came out of your ass, besides i have asthma
Ok, you are right. If you can't I’ll do it

I didn't say i couldn't
You can't or you don't want to
I didn't say that i couldn't

Or you don't want to and that is the same. Or you could give
me Chichina's fifteen bucks...

...and we eat as God intended, c'mon.

Look if i get to find that fucking duck, I’ll eat it all by myself
Ah! in the water, in the water, duck.

I'm going to get my balls frozen
For the use you give them, Fuser...

Good Fuser, good...bring on that duck with potatoes.
Is it cold Fuser? Hey! cold? Not over here.

Duck

Are you feeling sick?
No, I’m just perfect

Bariloche Train Station, Argentina
3 days later
Km 2270

Easy

Fuser...

Fuser, listen to me. Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars and let's
go to a hospital like the people

If you say that to me again, I’ll throw up all over you.

<i>Dear mom...what is it that's lost when you cross a border.
Each moment seems to be split in two</i>

<i>Melancholy for what was left behind and on the
other hand all the enthusiasm at entering new lands</i>

Frias Lake, Argentina
February 15th, 1952
Km 2306

Look Mial, Chile
Chile! Viva Chile!

Is it your first time out of the country?
Yes, of course

You are almost a man, Che

Look Mial, when we are old and tired of traveling, we
should come back and set a clinic on this lake

That's a good idea

Providing attention to everybody, if anyone ever comes

Count on me, brother

Hey, things are getting better Fuser, eh?
Yeah

Hey, it is snowing
No, is just frost

Help me
On three, 1, 2, 3
Done

Go, go, go

Fuck is cold!
Some summer, uh

Che, you told me we would enter Chile like two conquerors.
Not on foot like a pair of losers

If you don't like it, go fuck yourself Ernesto

TEMUCO, CHILE
February 18th, 1952
Km 2772

What if we dump this shit that gives us so much trouble

And go on foot through the whole continent, you genius

Yes, we would see more and meet more people...
you would lose weight

You sissy, but if with a couple of dollars from
Chichina this gets fixed immediately

And again with the same thing. Forget about that money

Ok, perfect. If you get that mad then go all the way to Venezuela
walking and leave me here alone with the boss's money

Know what? I would get there in half the time and stop
meddling with other people business

Fuck you bastard!

"Uy, Ernestito, bring me the little Yankee pants
from Miami"

Can't you see that you will never see them on or off?
You wanker!

Fuser..

You know what your problem is?

Your fucking honesty.

You should tell a lie from now and then to help us.

Hold it for a second

Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Come, Come

Thank you

What? Do you have "mate"? Thank you.
It has sugar

Excuse me, what's your name?
Teresa
Teresa, Ernesto, nice to meet you

It would be nice as a souvenir, eh?
A souvenir? I'll take back to Argentina

-You are traveling?
Yes we are traveling, we are the owners of that old bike
A the big one over there

What are these?
This is "malton"

And This?
These are oysters

Maybe next time ,ok? next time...

Austral Newspaper, only 3 pesos

Get informed about Chile and the world,

Yesterday evening, Temuco was honored by the arrival
of 2 of the most renowned leprosy specialists of Latin America

Dr. Alberto Granados from Córdoba
What do you mean "Granados"
That's what it says

Dr. Alberto Granados from Córdoba and
Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna from Buenos Aires

They have embarked on an epic trip from their
homeland to the north point of Venezuela

The charismatic adventurer scientists, experts in their field,
have treated three thousand patients in all the continent.

They hope to complete their trip in a record time of
five months, just in time to celebrate the 30th birthday
of the youthful Dr. Granados

It says youthful, eh?
 Yes, and so i get informed too.

Do you think it will work?

Hello, good evening

My friend and i  have some problems with our bike
The direction is broken, the brakes are practically gone
and the shift box as always...

And my backside is killing me...

Let's see. I can fix the direction, the brakes and the shift box.

But i can't do anything about your backside.

We don't have any money

What? You don't have any money?

When we get to Valparaiso we will receive some money,
when we have it we will send it to you...

You know, i wouldn't want to be rude, but if you
don't have any money,
you have nothing to do here, so please...

Excuse me the interruption, but if you help us right now you will
contribute to the bilateral relationships between our countries

If i understand correctly, you want me to fix it for free

I think we are not making ourselves clear

besides we can't expect everybody to know
who's who in the Latin-American medicine field

Please doctor, come on in
Yes, precisely today there was an article
published on the paper...

Let me see...allow me
Yes of course

Look Piedad, Tulio look...

Well the picture is not very good
Yes we are not favorably depicted

Look, is them...

Gentlemen, for me it will be a great honor to fix your bike,
once i finish this card game with my wife

Of course, there's no problem

That's the main priority.

Do you know that tonight there's a dance
and God willing, all the ladies of the town will be there

Oh, what a shame.

Could you give me the paper back?
Thanks a lot, you are very kind

I'll bring the bike over
Please bring it over, we will fix it

Could i have this dance?

Cheers!

You know, i was just thinking about you

And why is that?

You made quite an impression when i met you

Thanks

Would you like to dance?
No

I don't dance

My husband fell asleep, he's drunk.
I don't have a dance partner

Well, if you teach me, yes?

Hey, you finally remembered that you are a man?

You had forgotten?

It's been a long time since i danced,
but is coming back to me, is coming back...

I can't dance here

Would you like to keep dancing?

Wouldn't you prefer to go out

I would love to, yes

Let's go

What's going on?
No, we better stay

Let me go!

The Argentinean is leaving with your wife

Let me go!

Sorry, sorry...I’m sorry

Argentinean mother fucker!!

Aren't you tired?

No

Don't you want to switch?
No

Are you sure?

Cows! cows!

I can't Stop, I can't stop!

The brakes don't work

Fucking mechanic

Are you ok?
Perfect, what do you want me to tell you Fuser?

Shitty mechanic

Is he your father?

Yes

Hey, that cow is going blind

...for the shit it's going to see

Los Angeles, Chile
February 26th, 1952
Km 2940

We are 25 days behind

Wait wait wait wait

Hello

There's a rumor that the Chilean women are the most
daring in all the continent

Well, the rumors have no scientific support Dr. Granado.
We have to make a field test

You didn't like them, really?

Here they come

Hello girls

Excuse us, the place is packed...

Can we sit with you?
Yes, of course
Thanks

How are you?...Ernesto
He is Alberto

Miss?
Jazmín

Daniela

Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you

So are you Argentineans?
How did you know?

I don't know...the accent,
because you say "Che", i don't know

Had you noticed that Che? i hadn't
No me neither

Do you know what day is today?
February 26th

February 26th...we are going to seem like liars,
but it has been a year...

A year? A year since when?

A year since we started this trip
That's nice

Damn, one year and we don't have one cent to celebrate
Wouldn't you like us to invite you a bottle of wine?

Wine?
Yes...

Lucho, bring a bottle of wine to our Argentinean visitors that
have made such an effort

But ladies, please don't takes this the wrong way,
but i can't drink wine

But why, why can't you drink a little wine to celebrate?
Exactly...

Well there is an old tradition in Argentina that...
Please c'mon, don't...
What?

I think they deserve and explanation
Is adequate, yes

Thanks Lucho...Well, there is a long costume in Argentina
that doesn't allow us to drink with empty stomachs

And since we don't have any money at the moment, we can't
buy food and we must reject your generous offer

Please, don't be like that...wait.
Lucho, could you bring us some empanadas

Do you like Chilean empanadas?
I have never tried them

four, eight?
They are really hungry.  Twelve.

I've always liked that number

I would really like to stay here
Too bad we don't have a place to stay,
but we can sleep at the plaza

Hey, but my father loves Argentineans.
I think he can help you

He is the chief of the fire department,
so he knows a lot of people

Wait, are you sisters?

Yes, of course, you hadn't noticed? Look...

They hadn't noticed.

The mechanic doesn't come back until tomorrow,
but the bike can stay here

Thanks a lot

Guys, let me introduce you to two Argentinean volunteers
that will be staying here with you

Let me introduce you to Dr. Che Skinny and Dr. Che Fatty
Nice to meet you

Hey, would you like to see more of the town?
Yes

But...
Don't worry sir

Excuse me...
Yes?

I wouldn't like to bother you, but are you really doctors?

No
Yes
No

I'm a biochemist

Could you visit a lady that is sick
Yes, when you tell me...

Could it be right now, cause she is really sick.
It's been a very long time since she saw a doctor

Ok, let me pick up my things and we will go.

Is nice to be faithful to the Hippocratic oath, Fuser

Excuse me

Look at my eyes

I'm going to touch your neck a little

Has she eaten?

I don't know

Look, Doña Rosa, I’m going to leave you these pills

Take one with each meal

And one before bedtime.

This will help you feel better

<i>Dear mom...I knew i wouldn't be able to help that poor woman</i>

<i>That up to a month ago she had been serving
tables, panting like me</i>

<i>Trying to live with dignity</i>

<i>In those dying eyes, there was a humble
request for excuses</i>

<i>And a desperate plea of consolation
that gets lost in the emptiness</i>

<i>Just as her body will get lost very soon
in the magnitude of the mystery that surrounds us</i>

Fuser, you still haven't asked me how was the
field test with the Chilean sisters

You know how i fear that you might become
the new sexual ambassador of Argentina

Are you the two lazy asses that travel
on that piece of crap

Her name is "La Poderosa"

It was. But now we could name it The Dead One, The Paraplegic

Oh yeah, why?

What do you mean why? Because I’m
the mechanic, what else

If you sell it per pound, you might obtain something,
but that piece of crap arrived dead here, really

I'll be missing you Negra

I'll take these, let's go

What do we do? Should we go on?

Yes, we go on.
You only reach 30 once in a lifetime

You are really something
Ernesto Guevara de la Serna

If we change the dollars...
No, don't even think about it

We arrived at Valparaiso

"I love Valparaiso. How much you encompass
and how much you irradiate bride of the ocean"

"Even far away from your deaf halo..."

No
No, it's Neruda

Km 3573

Thank you

From Chichina!
Chichina, and the money?

Should i open it?
Yes open it

I leave you alone love bird

How do i love you Celia de la Serna!

What's going on?

Fuser

Che, are you ready?
Me?
Yes you

Of course
Let's go

Right away sir

Atacama Desert, Chile
March 11, 1952
Km 4960

You know what, my plan was a lot better

You are so fucking proud, at least answer me

Do you want to go back?

Go ahead...
I'll get to the mine and then I’ll tell you what it looks like

Are you suggesting that i won't make it to the mine?

If you can little doctor asthma, i can do it too

Moron

Oh, you want to win?

Stop! Fuck!

Good evening, how are you?
What's your name?

Ernesto
Nice to meet you

Yes, that's it, that's were we are from

We didn't have much, just a dry and difficult land

It belonged to his grandparents

It was ours, until a landlord arrived and kicked us out

And that is what they call progress
We had to leave our son with the family and travel to find job

Trying to escape from the police that wanted to catch us
Why?

Because we are communists

We are going to the mine. If we are lucky I’ll find a job.

Apparently they are so dangerous that they
don't care what party you belong to

Are you looking for a job?

No, we are not.

No? And then why are you traveling?

Just because

Bless you, blessed be your travels

Take this

Thanks

Some "mate"
Thanks

<i>Those eyes had a dark and tragic expression</i>

<i>They told us about some friends that had disappeared
under mysterious circumstances</i>

<i>And that apparently ended up in some
part on the bottom of the ocean</i>

<i>That was one of the coldest nights of my life</i>

<i>But meeting them made me feel closer to human kind.
Strange, so strange to me</i>

You...you too
You, the next one

Move it, guys, move it

Chuquicamata Mine, Chile
March 15th, 1952
Km 5122

Move it, guys, move it

Get in the truck. The rest go to your homes.
Out

You two, what are doing here?

Nothing, we are looking

Looking at what, this is not a tourist attraction. Out

Can't you see that these people are thirsty.
Give them some water damn it.

I will call security so they will arrest you

Oh yeah. Why?

Invasion of property. This is the property of the
Anaconda Mining Company

Let's go.

Son of a bitch
