WOMAN :
Wake up, my beauties.

Rise and shine.

It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

is at peace.

But not for Iong.

Just Iook at them.

I pull one tiny thread,

and their whole world unravels
into chaos.

GIorious chaos.

And what could be more
perfect than this?

A noble prince,

a priceless treasure,

and a black-hearted thief.

Oh, this is going to be fun.

-( rumbling purr)
-Cetus?

You know what to do.

Let the games begin.

( splashing )

MAN:
Gentlemen, this is
what we've been waiting for.

( barks )

The world's most valuable object

is on its way to Syracuse.

It's a shame
it'II never get there.

-( crew laughing )
-( barking )

After today, we retire to Fiji.

( cheering )

-Fiji!
-Fiji!

( laughing )

Kale!

Aye, Captain.

-Spike!
-( barks )

Let's get rich!

( grunts )

( barking )

( yells )

( shouting )

( yells )

( gasps and grunts )

( shouting )

( grunts )

Did you catch
that Iast move?

Pretty cool, huh?

I thought you
overworked it.

Just a bit.

Aw, y...

Overworked it?

( guard yelling )

( grunts )

( gasps )

( guard yelling )

Oh, and I was overworking it?

( chuckles )

( grunting )

Proteus.

Whoa.

This just got interesting.

How Iong has it been?

About a Iifetime ago.

( swords clashing )

( grunting )

You still fight
Iike an old Iady.

Sinbad?

-( grunting )
-Oh. Ooh.

Sinbad.

What...?
What are you doing here?

I'm working.

You?

What happened to you?

Where have you been?

Hey, Iove to stop and catch up,

but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

( scattered chuckles )

( whistles )

Oh... yeah.

Sinbad,
we need to talk.

Heard about it,
read about it,

never actually seen it.

The Book of Peace.

It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

Really? Now, see, now,
I-I just feel bad,

because you're going
to get fired.

You can't be serious.

You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

I wish it wasn't you.

I do.

( chuckling ):
Really.

-But...
-But it is me, Sinbad.

Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

a secret hideout.

It was fun, big fun,
but, uh, we were kids.

We were friends!

You're not going
to steal this.

Not from me.

And what would you
do with it anyway?

The Book of Peace protects
all of us in the Twelve Cities.

SINBAD:
Exactly.

So, just imagine
how much all of us

will pay to get it back.

Let me say it again.

A Iong time ago,
you and I were friends.

If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

You're right.

That was a Iong time ago.

( both grunting )

( sword clangs )

( pants )

Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

( rumbling and grunting )

What the...?

( both panting )

( yelling )

Dear gods.

( yelling )

( barking )

( chuckles ):
Go, Spike.

-I gotcha! I gotcha!
-( yelps )

Well, I see you're busy.

So, uh, stay in touch.

Wait! Wait!

You're just going
to run away?

Uh, yeah.

Wh-whoa!

Sinbad!

You! My...!

My ship!

( grunts )

-( roars )
-( grunts )

( roaring )

( yells )

SINBAD:
Heads up!

( yelling )

Now...
stand by for sushi.

( rumbling )

( belches )

( groaning )

( screaming )

Give that guy a raise.

Come on!
Come on, Sinbad!

Let's go!

Wait.
Stand your ground.

-( whistling )
-W-What are you doing?

SINBAD:
Hey!

Hey, hey!

Lobster Boy, over here!

( roaring )

Run!

Fall back!

Grab hold!

Let's go!

( panting )

Come on!

( grunting )

And the plan?

How about try not to get killed?

Hold on!

( grunting )

Here, you'II need this.

Where are you going?

Fishing!

( grunts )

( snarling )

Left, right, Ieft, right,
Ieft, right, Ieft, right.

( grunts )

( growling )

Now!

( Proteus and Sinbad yelling )

PROTEUS:
Whoo!

Woo-hoo!

( crew cheering )

( grunts )

-Oh...
-You okay?

Yeah.

Thanks for sticking around.

Ah, just Iike old times.

( men shouting )

Look out!

-( grunting )
-Sinbad!

( grunting )

( grunting )

( blowing )

( gasping )

WOMAN:
The day began with such promise.

And now Iook.

My sea monster is dead,

and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

AII because of you, Sinbad.

( panting ):
Uh-huh.

And you are?

Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

No doubt you've seen
my Iikeness

on the temple walls.

( chuckles nervously)

You know,
they don't do you justice.

Uh-huh. Now...

about my sea monster.

Right, right.

Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

( chuckles wryly)

Heartfelt? From you?

Sinbad, you don't have a heart.

( sighs )

That's what I Iike about you.

So, I'm going
to Iet you Iive.

But there's
just one Iittle thing

you have to do.

Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

Right. Hmm.

Now, see, that's
a problem for me

because I had
my own plans for it.

Uh, ransom, get rich.

You know, "me" stuff.

( startled cry)

You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

Steal the Book for ransom,

and you'II be
rich enough

to Iounge
on an island beach.

Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

and the island and the world.

Hmm.

You Iet me Iive,
you make me rich,

I retire to paradise.

So far, I don't see a downside.

If you keep your word.

Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

she's bound for all eternity.

AII right, you're on.

I knew you'd
see it my way.

So, when you've
stolen the Book,

follow that star
beyond the horizon.

You'II find yourself

in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

Tartarus.

I'II see you there.

It's a date then.

So, where were we?

( chuckling ):
Oh, yes.

You were holding your breath.

He's so cute.

And so gullible.

Cetus, well done.

( rumbling purr)

( gasps, coughs )

( Kale grunts )

-( men cheering, Spike barking )
-Sinbad, you're alive!

GIad you made it.

Pay up.
He Iived.

( groans )

What happened down there?

( gasping ):
You wouldn't...

believe me if I told you.

Try me.

AII right, here goes.

So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

She's got
a major crush on me,

and she invited me
back to her place.

Ha! That's a good one!

-Goddess of Chaos?
-( crew chuckling )

Oh, I'm writing that down.

So, that's it then?
No Book.

Now what do we do?

A Iittle patience, Rat.

It's not Iike we don't know
where it's going.

Men, all sails to Syracuse!

Right away, sir!

( cheering )

* *

* *

For as Iong
as I can remember,

I've dreamed of this moment.

The sacred treasure

that's protected us
for a thousand years

is now in Syracuse.

-A toast!
-To Dymas!

Hear, hear!

To the Book of Peace!

And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

-Make way!
-( crowd gasping )

( swords unsheathe )

You see?

This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

Mm-hmm.

What is he doing here?

At Ieast he's not out
robbing someone.

That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

( panting )

I'II bet you ten crowns

you're about to put
those swords down.

I'II take that bet.

PROTEUS:
Guards...

put away your swords.

I don't see you for ten years,

and now twice in one day...
( scoffs )

You're smothering me.

( chuckles )

I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your Iife... again.

( chuckles )

You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

You hear that, guys?

Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

Come on.

There's someone
I want you to meet.

( softly):
Get to work.

Weapons?

-( growls )
-( gasps )

( chuckling )

PROTEUS:
Here she is.

I've told her
all about you.

( gasps )

( clears throat )

Sinbad, I would
Iike to introduce you

to my fiancee,

the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

So, this is the infamous Sinbad.

I heard all about this morning.

First you tried to rob Proteus,
and then you save his Iife.

So, which are you...

a thief or a hero?

PROTEUS:
Sinbad wanted

to give me an opportunity
to thank...

-( indistinct conversation )
-( music plays )

...him.

( gobbling noisily )

RAT:
Eight months on the sea

with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

you don't know what
that can do to a man.

Oh, it's almost too easy.

There's only
a handful of guards.

Forget it.

Let's get back to the ship.

Just Iike that?

But the Book is almost ours.

( sighs )

Oh.

Wh-What?
Who is she?

An old girlfriend?

I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

Let's go.

Jed, pack it up.

What? I-I... I just put the...

( groans in disgust)

( chuckles wickedly)

Oh, this is just too easy.

Look at it this way:

Now that Sinbad's gone,

your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

( Proteus chuckles )

Well, you're right about that.

He's trying not to show it,

but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

He's been planning this day
his whole Iife.

And soon it will be
your responsibility.

Our responsibility.

( sighing ):
It's beautiful.

It is.

My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

There are guards
on every Ievel,

and if you Iook
up to the...

Ah... ( chuckles softly)

You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

I only wish I'd
seen more of it.

I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

discovering the world.

( chuckles softly)

Oh, Iook at it, Proteus.

There's so much wonder.

Marina...

Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

It's always been expected of us.

But politics is not a reason
to get married.

Uh, and I don't want you
to do this

just because it's your duty.

I'm asking you
for myself now.

Marina...

will you marry me?

Proteus, I...

DYMAS:
There you are!

I think the delegates
from Manoli

are trying to give a toast.

AIthough, I'm not sure.

They're doing something
with their knees.

Marina, I need
an ambassador.

( exhales )

Of course, Sire.

( people laughing and chatting
in distance )

( wind whistling )

( whooshing )

-( candle wick sizzles )
-Huh?

* *

( wind howling softly )

-( sizzling )
-Who's there?

( hissing )

Huh?

Sinbad!

( grunting )

( groans )

I Iove playing pretend.

( chuckles wickedly )

AII the pieces
are coming together.

( loud rumbling )

Proteus, the Book!

( loud rumbling )

( gasps )

( loud rumbling )

( debris clattering )

( grunts and groans )

PROTEUS :
Sinbad.

Proteus!

It's about time.

Do you realize
how serious this is?

Do you realize

how many times
I've heard that today?

You've betrayed Syracuse!

Oh... not you, too.

Stealing the Book of Peace,

when you knew how much
it meant to us!

Proteus, here's
the way this works.

First, I actually
commit a crime,

and then you get
to blame me for it!

Then how do
you explain this?

Eris.

What?

Eris... she framed me.

-Sinbad, Iisten to yourself.
-Trust me, Proteus,

the Book is in Tartarus.

Talk to your father.
Tell him I'm...

This is beyond my father.

The ambassadors are convening
now for your trial.

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

Trial? I didn't do it!

Look, I Ieft the Book
on your ship,

and that's the
Iast I saw of it.

You were there.

You know the truth.

You know me.

Do I?

I knew a kid.

Who are you now, Sinbad?

( sighs )

Look me in the eye
and tell me.

Did you steal the Book?

No.

DYMAS:
We've heard enough of your Iies.

Sinbad,

for the Iast time,
give us the Book.

How many times
do I have to say it?

I don't have it!

AMBASSADOR:
Very well, then.

The Delegation

of the Twelve Cities finds you
guilty of treason,

and we sentence you to die.

Take him away.

Come on!
This is a joke, right?

Are you...
are you people blind?

I didn't do it!

PROTEUS:
Stop!

( gasps )

I demand the right
of substitution.

Take me in his place.

No!

Sinbad says

that Eris took the Book...

and I believe him.

Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.

What?

( murmuring )

What are you doing?

You claim that Eris
stole the Book--

steal it back.

You're good at that.

Hey, Iook, I will not be
responsible for your Iife.

You would do
the same for me.

No, I wouldn't.

DYMAS:
If Sinbad is allowed to Ieave

the city, he'II
never come back!

Son, Iisten to reason.

No, Father, you Iisten.

Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

and it's in Tartarus.

Either way,
he's our only hope.

But you can't...

Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

you will be put to death
in his place.

I understand.

( sighs )

So be it.

Sinbad has ten days

to return the Book.

( sighs )

Release him.

( crowd murmuring )

( sighs )

Oh, and, Sinbad...

don't be Iate.

( groans )

* *

( creaking )

Hmm.

So, any idea

how we actually
get to Tartarus?

Tartarus?

( chuckling ):
Oh, no, no, no, no.

People get killed in Tartarus.

So where are we going?

Fiji.

Fiji? This time of year?

Think of the beaches.

Oh, beautiful,
if you Iike mosquitoes.

Think of the sun.

It's monsoon season.

Oh, then the women.

They're cannibals, Sinbad.

Exactly.

( groans )

Come on, Kale.

He's your friend.

Listen to you.
You sound Iike my mother.

Proteus will be fine.

You're sure of that?

You and I both know

Dymas is not going to Iet them
execute his only son.

So we're running away?

We're retiring.

We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

Now, set a course for Fiji.

Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

-( cheering )
-Fiji! Fiji!

( Spike barking )

( grumbling ):
Kale... Book.

( grunting ):
Proteus.

Look at all this.

I can't believe it.

Oh, but this can't be real.

It'd be far too deli...

-( clattering )
-Uh-oh.

This is more Iike it.

Stolen from Venezia.

( exhales )

From Pompeii...

And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

Good guess.

( gasps )

What do you think
you're doing here?

I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.

Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

Really?

And how are you going
to pull that off?

By whatever means necessary.

Did you bring a crew?

No.

You know how to
get to Tartarus?

Um... no.

Can you navigate
on your own?

Yes!

Well, good!

Then I'II dump your butt
in a rowboat,

and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

'Cause we're going to Fiji.

Fiji?

Yup.

Just as I thought.

What?

Sinbad,

you're not
a very complicated guy.

AII someone has to do

is imagine the most
gutless course of action,

and you're bound to take it.

Hey, this is not my problem.

I did not steal the Book.

You're really not going to Iose
any sleep over this, are you?

Not a wink.

Because me,
I'd be tossing and turning,

knowing I'm alive...
because I Iet my friend die.

( groans in disgust)

I'm not responsible
for this mess.

And I didn't ask Proteus

to put his neck
on the Iine for me.

Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your honor.

But I have other ways
of convincing you.

Really?

Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?

By speaking your Ianguage.

Keep talking.

(jewels clink )

Yup, this'II do!

But not for first class.

As you can see, we're
well equipped to accommodate

the most discerning
of royal tastes.

We have excellent ocean views...

( Marina grunting )

...Iuxurious Iiving quarters,

with three
gourmet meals a day--

pickles, eggs, and pickles.

( barks )

Oh, hey, Spike,
there you are.

I'd Iike to introduce you

to your new bunkmate--
well, actually,

you're his new bunkmate,

as it's actually his bunk.

-( Sinbad chuckles )
-( groans in disgust )

We do hope

you have a pleasant stay
aboard the Chimera.

Oh, if he starts
hugging your Ieg,

it means he Iikes you.

( grunts )

If you think...

( Spike barks )

How did she even get
on the ship?

( startled grunts )

( exaggerated yawn )

Gentlemen, we have a new course.

We're going to Tartarus.

Huh? What
happened to Fiji?

What? No fun?

No beaches?

Rat.

Sorry, Captain.

But did you
say Tartarus?

That's right.

Will that be
the same Tartarus

from which no sailor
ever returns?

The Tartarus
of Iost souls,

where they
grind your bones

and pickle your
spleen, and...

No, Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus,

with Iots of beaches and drinks.

You know,
with Iittle umbrellas?

( muttering in Italian ):
Non ci posso credere,

non ci posso credere,
mi hanno fregato ancora.

I'm only doing this
for the money.

Right.

So how do we get there?

That star's our point.

( clicking )

( grunting )

Wow.

Our Iittle thief
isn't going to run away.

( hisses )

He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.

( hissing and clicking )

Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.

( Sirens singing sweetly )

( scraping )

( Marina grunts )

Oh, come on. You Iook great.

( whimpering )

Look Iively!
Jed, get the Iong poles!

Oh, pardon me, milady.

Hey, we need
a pole over here.

Jin, one over here.

Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

The Dragon's Teeth?

( Rat clears throat)

( grunts )

Indeed, signorina.

Only the most
foolish of captains

would dare to sail
a ship through this!

SINBAD:
Rat, reef the fores'Ie.

Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.

( grunts )

Are you sure
you know what...?

Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

-No, there is no other way.
-Look...

-And, yes,
-But...

you have my permission
to stand there quietly

and get a free Iesson
in sailing.

You know...

Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

( gasps )

Jin!

Easy on the main!

JIN:
Aye!

( grunts with disgust)

( wind whistling )

( clattering )

Steady as she goes.

Rocks off the starboard bow!

( Sirens singing softly )

( clattering )

Steady.

( Sirens singing softly )

( dripping )

What is that sound?

Shh.

( tinkling )

( Sirens singing )

Sinbad, I...

( barking )

Sirens.

( Sirens humming )

Sinbad.

( water roaring )

( gasps ):
Sinbad!

Jin?

-Li?
-( kissing )

Come and get it, Iadies!

Kale?

Come with me.

We'II speak of Iove.

Oh... ( kissing )

Who's bad?

Sin-bad.

Ah... men.

( Sirens singing )

( grunts )

( grunts )

( sighing )

( Sirens singing )

( groans )

I saw her first!

( grunts )

Round the deck! Now!

Yeah...

( gasps )

RAT:
Amore!

Amore! Amore!

My darling.

Rat!

I Iove you.

( grunting and groaning )

II mare e Ie onde andiamo via.

( Siren humming )

( grunting )

( groaning )

( Siren shrieking )

Spike!

Get Sinbad!

( barking )

Ow!

( Sirens singing )

( yells )

( groaning )

( grunts )

( grunts )

( singing intensifies )

Spike, the blades!

( barks )

( grunts )

( Sirens screaming )

( fluttering )

( sighs )

( coughing )

( groans and sighs )

Oh, my precious.

Wake up, you idiot!

( groans )

What happened?

Sinbad saved us.

RAT:
No, Marina.

CREWMEMBERS:
Marina saved us? Marina!

Marina saved us.

KALE:
AII right, men, snap out of it.

Let's get back to reality.

We got a ship to sail.

Here's my Iittle hero.

You were so brave.

Yeah. What a good dog.

Uh...

Uh... ( clears throat)

Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

( huffs )

Absolutely!

( whines )

I mean, Iook at my ship!

This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

And here!

These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

Do you have any idea

what I went through
to steal these?

( scoffs )

That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

Are you crazy?

I saved your Iife!

Oh, I would've been fine.

I always am.

Right.

( muttering ):
So ungrateful.

It's just typical.

And you chipped the paint!

Right here--
Iook at it.

That's more than
a Iittle scratch.

( grunts angrily)

( Spike barks )

( snorts and whines )

( grunts angrily )

The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!

What?!

-Thank you!
-You're welcome!

-No problem!
-Don't worry about it!

-I won't!
-Good!

-Good-bye!
-Bye to you!

( huffs )

( crew murmuring )

( panting )

You happy now?

( panting )

( scoffs )

( barks and whines )

( keys jingling )

( door opening )

Proteus, come quickly.

What? Wh...?

There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.

A crew of my most
trusted officers

will take you
far from Syracuse.

But the ambassadors' guards?

Are asleep or well-bribed.

But we must go now.

Go where?

To Iive the rest of my Iife
in exile?

To Iive, son.

I won't Iet them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.

Neither will Sinbad.

Proteus, don't be foolish!

Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

Is still in him as a man.

I've seen it.

Proteus... ( sighs )

Go, Father.

I know what I'm doing.

( door creaks shut)

( lock clicks )

( sighs )

KALE:
AII right, Iisten up.

We're here for ten minutes.

You get Iost, you get Ieft.

( groans )

How did one woman
do so much damage?

( wood breaking )

AII right, I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

the jack plane,
and about a cord of cut wood.

AII right, men, you
heard the captain.

Find some Iogs
and be quick about it.

-( groans )
-Oh, for heaven's sake!

You only need
a Iittle tree sap,

and she'II be
as good as new.

When I want
your advice, I'II...

Hey, hey, hey!

Where do you think
you're going?

Well, fine!
At Ieast take someone with y...

LI:
May I assist you, Iady?

-( men speaking at once )
-Why, thank you.

-Right this way, signorina.
-How nice to see

some men haven't forgotten
a Iittle common courtesy.

( muttering ):
...common courtesy.

Not so fast.

But you know she's right.

The tree sap would
be perfect for...

Just...

stay with the ship.

( grunts )

( birds chirping,
Spike barking )

I already said thank you.

That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

It's about repairing the ship.

If I break something,
I fix it.

Um, knife, please.

Oh, yeah,
Iike I'd give you a weapon?

Thank you, Rat.

You know, you really
ought to be

a Iittle more courteous.

( chuckles )

Oh, great.

Now I'm getting
etiquette Iessons

from a bilge rat.

Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

Why, thank you, Luca.

RAT:
And now she's helping to fix it.

JIN:
Very handy, I say.

And brave!

This... girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

pig-headed man
I've ever met.

Hey, Iady, I've seen
the highborn boys

your type hangs out with...
( chuckles )

...and I'm the only man
you've ever met.

( Marina grunts )

-( groans )
-Whoa.

-Mmm.
-( Spike whimpering )

( Marina chuckles softly )

Oh, no. No. No.

No...

Five on Marina.

( groans )

You... you...

egotistical...

-You spoiled...
-disrespectful,

-deluded,
-pretentious, pompous,

-high-and-mighty...
-self-centered, untrustworthy,

ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

At Ieast I'm not repressed!

Repressed?!

I'II show you
repressed!

( grunts )

-( rumbling )
-( gasps )

( birds screeching )

What the...?

( low whooshing )

( quietly ):
Put it back.

( chuckles nervously )

-( rumbling )
-( gasping and yelling )

-Whoa! Whoa!
-Whoa, whoa...

-( rumbling stops )
-Ew...

( barking )

Ew!

( all yelling )

( raspy growling )

Run!

-It's a fish!
-It's a fish!

SINBAD:
Kale!

Kale!

-( loud thud )
-Whoa!

( deep roaring )

( yells )

-Jump!
-( Marina screams )

-( men yelling )
-( Spike barking )

( Sinbad yelling )

Kale!

Got it!

-( all yelling )
-( Spike barking )

Veer off, Kale!

The star!

Hold your heading!

SINBAD:
Rat, tie it off!

( stammering ) :
Wha... wha...

( Sinbad grunts )

Ha-ha!

RAT:
Wait!

( yells )

( Marina laughs )

SINBAD:
Yee-ha!

* *

* *

( groans )

KALE:
Sinbad!

The men can't take much more.

( groans ):
I can't...

take much more, either.

Cut the Iine!

( groaning, gagging
and moaning )

( belches )

-( Spike hiccups )
-Oh, no, Spike!

-Whoa, hold on, no...
-No, no, no, please...

-Oh, Spike!
-( Spike vomits )

JED:
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

( groans )

Whose idea was that again?

I don't know.

( chuckles )

But he owes me Iunch.

The Granite Gates.

Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

( chuckling ):
No, I didn't.

But Proteus did.

For some reason,
he trusts you.

( chuckles softly)

Well, what could
he have been thinking?

How did you
two ever meet?

( chuckles )

Running for my
Iife, as usual.

A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

outside the palace walls.

I was trapped.

A sword at my throat,

at my chest, at my...

-Pickles and eggs!
-( men groaning )

( clears throat )

Well, you get the idea.

And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

It was Proteus.

You see, he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

He actually climbed down

the castle wall
to fight at my side,

and, boy, did we fight.

It was Iike we'd rehearsed it.

We were best friends
from that day forward.

What happened with you two?

( chuckles softly ):
What is it?

We... took different paths.

( liquid bubbling )

Enough talking.

Time for some screaming.

-( blowing )
-( ice crackling )

( loud rumbling )

( whimpering )

For crying out Ioud,
what next?

Oh, get a shirt on

before you poke
someone's eye out.

Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

We've got to keep moving!

( grunting )

Steal the Book of Peace.

( shivering and grunting )

We will retire in the tropics.

( grunting and shivering )

-( distant whooshing )
-( barking )

-( whooshing continues )
-( barking )

( loud whoosh )

( gasps )

( barks )

( whimpers )

( loud boom )

( loud screeching )

( Marina gasps )

( loud screeching )

Everyone, back on the ship!

MARINA:
Hurry!

KALE:
Come on! Come on! Move faster!

( grunting and panting )

-( screeching )
-( gasping and grunting )

( yells )

( loud rumbling )

( screeches )

Jed!

Grab the rope!

KALE:
Rat, your hand!

Marina!

-( Sinbad grunts )
-( Marina shrieks )

( Marina cries )

( grunting and panting )

( screeches )

( gasps )

( pounding steps
and screeching )

( fierce growling )

( gasping )

* *

( growls and screeches )

( low squawking )

( loud screeching )

SINBAD:
Rat! Don't let

-the blocks freeze!
-Aye, aye, Captain.

-And, Kale!
-Aye!

Give me a hug?

( grunts ) :
Excuse me?

Hmph.

( whistles )

( barking )

* *

( grunts )

( groans )

( grunts and sighs )

( grunting )

Oh, she couldn't see the bird?

Everyone else saw it.

( grunting )

It's as big as a freakin' ship.

Marina?
Marina's Iooking the other way.

( screeching )

( loud boom )

( gasps )

-Shh, shh, shh.
-( muffled shouting )

( screeching, loud boom )

You're rescuing me!

Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

( gasping )

( whispers ):
So...

how are we going
to get down?

I... I don't know.

-What?!
-I don't know yet.

I'm thinking about it,
all right?

You scaled a thousand-
foot tower of ice,

and you don't know
how to get down?

Of all the ungrateful...
( grunts )

Look, if you'd rather
take your chances on your own,

that can be arranged.

Shh-shh-shh-shh.
AII right.

AII right.

( loud rumbling )

So,

what do we have
to work with?

Um... ropes?

Uh... no.

Uh, grappling hooks?

Yeah... no.

Your swords?

( grunts softly)

Hey, I've got this.

Oh, great.

He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

Yeah.

Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

a good knife has 1,001 uses.

-Ooh!
-( knife clangs )

( ice crackling )

( screeches )

-( grunts )
-( chuckles ): Uh...

( screeching )

Run!

( Marina gasping )

Come on! Faster!

MARINA:
W-Wait, wait. What?

Let's go!

MARINA:
No...!

Oh! Oh!

( both grunting and yelling )

-Oh!
-Ah!

I think we Iost him!

-I don't think so!
-Heads down!

( beak snapping shut)

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa!

-Whoa!
-( Marina yelling )

-( yells )
-Oh, no!

( Marina yells )

Lean right!

( screeching )

-Whew.
-( screeching )

-( Marina screams )
-Come on!

( yelling )

( Marina gasping )

-( screeching )
-Hang on!

( explosion )

( both yelling )

Yep, there they are.

( both grunt )

( panting )

There... ( clicks tongue )

just as I... planned.

( laughs softly )

CREW:
It's Marina!

( talking excitedly )

( sobbing ):
We thought you
were gone forever!

( clears throat )

Oh, I'm fine. Really.

But I'm touched by your concern.

( bones cracking )

( loud rumbling )

( all cheering )

Yee-ha!

( laughter and cheering )

* *

* *

( inhales )

Sinbad?

( exhales )

Thank you for coming after me.

Well, y...

you're welcome.

This Iife suits you.

( chuckles ):
Yeah.

I wasn't made for dry Iand.

( chuckles )

And you?

Is it the shore... or the sea?

I've always Ioved the sea.

I even dreamed
of a Iife on it.

But it wasn't meant to be.

I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

You really have to give it up?

Yes.

( sighs quietly )

( gasps softly )

* *

* *

You know, I've
traveled the world,

seen things no other
man has seen...

but nothing...

nothing compares
to the open sea.

And is this what
you always wanted?

( chuckles ):
Not really.

When we were young,
Proteus and I

used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

and serving Syracuse
side by side.

But as we got older,
our Iives began to change.

He's a prince,
and I'm... well.

( chuckles )

I was never jealous
of him, though...

until one morning,
a ship came into harbor...

a ship with his
future on it.

It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

( whispering ):
What was on the ship?

You.

Proteus met you
at the dock.

I jumped on the
first outbound ship

and never Iooked back.

Until now.

* *

( distant whooshing )

( loud whooshing )

( explosion )

The gates of T artarus.

( crew chattering indistinctly )

Rat! Give me a Iookout!

( grunts )

We're dead.

SINBAD:
What is it?!

I-I-It just ends, Captain!

It's the edge of the world!

Pay up. It's flat.

( coins clinking )

Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

Nuh-uh-uh.

The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

( sighs )

( quietly):
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

Beyond the horizon.

( wind whipping )

( fluttering )

Sinbad?

Men! AII hands to your posts!

Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

What?

Now! Go! Go! Go!

Eh, Sinbad, how-how are
we gonna pull this off?

Just trust me.

Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'Ie!

But that would stop us dead!

Just do it!

Aye, aye, Captain.

( grunts )

Whoa!

SIack to all sheets!

LUCA:
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

SINBAD:
Cut the fore and main trusses!

-Move! Move! Move!
-( speaking Cantonese )

LUCA:
I got it. I got it. I got it.

Aft yard astern!

JED:
But that's...

Crazy, I know! Now hurry!

-( grunting )
-( Jin speaking Cantonese )

JED:
Here, grab it!

RAT:
Go!

Swing the fors'Ie to port!

Ease the aft!
Full hoist to forward sails!

MARINA:
Aye, aye, Captain.

LUCA:
Come on!

Pull!

( grunting )

( wind whipping )

SINBAD:
Tie off all sails!

AII hands amidships!

And pray to the gods.

We may be meeting them soon.

We're going to die.

( grunts and pants )

( crew exclaiming )

( Marina gasps )

( ship creaking )

( grunts )

( crew shouting )

SINBAD:
Hold on! Grab the rope!

( barking )

( thunderous whoosh )

Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

( fluttering )

( grunting )

( snapping and whipping )

( thunder crashes )

-( gasps )
-( barking )

It worked?

Sinbad... ( chuckles )

...you did it.

( excited chatter and laughter)

( thunder crashes )

( creaking )

( metallic clang )

-( wood cracking )
-( crew gasping )

-( crew shouting )
-Grab hold!

Grum, hard to port!

GRUM:
Hard to port!

( crew shouting )

-Kale!
-Aye!

If I don't make it,
the ship is yours.

No.

Gentlemen, it's
been a privilege

robbing with you.

I'm coming with you.

And don't tell me

the Realm of Chaos is
no place for a woman.

( chuckles softly)

Hmm.

I would never say that.

( Spike barking )

( whimpers )

Hey, sorry, boy.

Not this time.

( whines )

( Marina yelling )

( crew gasping, Spike barking )

( thunder crashing )

( electrical crackling )

( rope whips )

( wind whistling )

( creatures chittering )

( grunts )

Huh?

( wind whistling )

( both grunting and panting )

( wood creaking )

( Marina pants )

( Sinbad grunts )

* *

( grunting )

( pounding footstep )

-Huh?
-Huh?

( chittering )

( growling )

( bellowing )

( grunts )

ERIS :
Now, now, my pets.

Is this any way
to treat a guest?

Okay, I'm severely creeped out.

Bravo.

No mortal has ever made it
to T artarus before.

( chuckling )

AIive, that is... ( chuckles )

Make yourself at home.

( chuckles nervously )

Thank you. Uh...

nice place you got here.

Like it?

I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

Wow, that's a good plan.

Well, I see you're busy,
so Iisten, we'II just take

the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

( chuckles )

What makes you think I have it?

Uh, well, you framed me
for the theft,

so they would execute me.

You?

Yeah.

No.

Proteus!

You knew he would take my place.

( chuckles )

What a clever Iittle man
you are.

You thought I'd run.

Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

Left without
the next rightful king,

and tumble into glorious chaos.

You humans are so predictable.

Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

and you couldn't help
betraying him.

But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

Oh, but you did betray him.

You stole his only Iove.

Look at her, Sinbad.

( grunts )

He's not even
in his grave yet,

and you're moving in
on his girl.

Face it: your heart
is as black as mine.

You're wrong about him!

He knows I'm not!

You don't know
what's in his heart.

Oh, yes, I do.

And more importantly,
so does he.

In your heart,
you know that

Proteus is
going to die

because he saw
something in you

that just isn't there.

No.

You want to bet?

I'II tell you what.
Let's play a game.

And if you win,
I'II give you

the Book of Peace.

( rumbling )

There it is, noble hero.

-( rumbling )
-( grunts )

ERIS:
Not so fast.

My game has rules,
Sinbad.

I'II ask you a question.

One simple question.

If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

-Give me your word.
-( exasperated sigh )

You still don't trust me?

Uh... no.

( exhaling ):
Isn't it a pity
we Iive in such skeptical times?

Oh, all right.

You have my word, as a goddess.

Fair enough?

Ask your question.

Excellent.

Now, we all know what happens

if you get the Book of Peace.

You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

But if you don't get the Book,

you have
a choice to make.

Either sail to paradise

with the woman
of your dreams,

or return to Syracuse to die.

You're either a thief or a hero.

So, here's my question, Sinbad.

If you don't get the Book,

will you go back to die?

( wind whistles )

I will go back.

( rumbling )

You're Iying.

( grunts )

( chuckles wickedly )

( grunts )

( grunts )

( inhales )

( sighs )

I'm sorry, Marina.

Eris is right about me.

No, she's not.
You answered her question.

You told the truth.

It wasn't the truth.

It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

You don't need to pretend!

Eris trapped you!

Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!

Marina...

No! You need to escape.

Get as far away as you can.

I'II go back.
I'II explain everything.

No, Marina.

( sobs )

I can't watch you die!

I Iove you.

* *

But could you Iove a man
who would run away?

* *

* *

( ax scrapes ground)

( whirring )

-( clang )
-( crowd exclaims )

( gasps, pants )

( crowd murmuring )

I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

( exhales )

I was... ( gulps )

...beginning to wonder.

The Book?

I did my best.

It wasn't enough.

No.

You came back anyway.

How could I do anything else...
my friend?

( whimpering )

* *

( Spike barking )

( whimpering )

( crowd murmuring )

* *

( tinkling )

( crowd gasping, exclaiming )

Get back!

( wind whipping )

( gasping )

How dare you?!

Everything
was going perfectly,

and now you do this!

( panicked cries )

Eris, I don't understand.

Don't play coy with me.

Maybe you can fool these people,

but I know who you are.

You're a selfish,
unprincipled Iiar!

Wait a minute.

I didn't Iie.

I came back.

That's why you're here.

This was all part
of your test.

I told the truth.

And wasn't there something

about being
"bound for all eternity"?

( gasps )

( grunts )

( sighs )

( crowd exclaims )

Well, well, well.

This has got to be a Iittle
embarrassing for you, Eris.

( chuckles softly )

Don't push your Iuck, Sinbad.

You're cute,
but not that cute.

And Iucky for you,
I've got places to go,

things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

Ta.

( sighs )

* *

( wind blows )

* *

( crowd cheering )

( panting )

You know,
for what it's worth,

I think the council
believes you now.

You think?

( cheering )

( chuckling )

King Dymas.

Uh, whoa, hey.

How much you got on you?

I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

and the apology of a king.

( chuckles )

No, really. How much?

Sinbad.

( chuckles softly )

( applauding )

Come on.

This is going to be
a heck of a party.

Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

Fair winds, calm seas.

Nothing much to tell.

( chuckles )

What's the matter?

No fun if you're
actually invited?

No, it's just, uh...

there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

Good sailing, Sinbad.

( distant cheers )

Get a haircut.

You're going to be king someday.

( applauding )

( whimpering )

( whimpering )

( crowd cheering )

( distant seagulls screeching )

Just another

uneventful day in Syracuse.

( chuckles softly )

You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

She Iooked over the ocean

and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

She saw... such wonder.

And what happened
to this woman?

She got her chance.

She sailed the seas,
and she fell in Iove.

( sighs )

Proteus, I...

Marina, follow your heart.

Mine is here in Syracuse.

Yours...

yours is sailing
with the next tide.

( sighing ):
Oh, Proteus.

( seagulls screeching )

Captain?

Hmm?

We're ready to sail.

AII right, Kale.

Take us out.

Aye, aye, Captain.

Cast off!

( crew shouting )

( whimpering )

Oh... Rat!

RAT:
What?

( chuckling )

MARINA:
Excuse me, Captain.

You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

The mizzen ropes
need the support.

These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

That's halfway around the world.

Then we'd better get started.

Well, you know,

that means going through
the Hydra's Iair.

-Mm-hmm.
-The Minotaur's haven.

-Mm-hmm.
-The Cyclops' den.

-Mm-hmm.
-Under the Swansea Bridge.

-Mm-hmm.
-Through the China Seas.

That's a very Iong voyage.

And it's very, very dangerous.

Don't worry.

I'II protect you.

( barking )

( barks )

( grunting )

SINBAD:
Oh, Spike.

MARINA ( chuckling ):
Spike.

SINBAD:
Spike... down.
