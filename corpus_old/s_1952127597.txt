[MALE VOICE LAUGHING]

MALE VOICE: So we got a pair
of newcomers to the cursed forest.

FinaIIy, some entertainment.

Yeah, I got bat wings.
And it ain't poIite to stare.

That's just the way
things work around here.

Oh, boy, I guess I gotta expIain.

You see, this is a cursed forest,
and I'm, uh, sort of a bat now.

Listen, I don't make the ruIes,
I just foIIow them.

And here's the main one:

Anytime somebody enters the forest,
at Ieast one sucker has gotta stay behind.

But because there's two of you,
onIy one has gotta stay.

Forever.


Yeah, that forever bit aIways gets them.

Hey, wait a minute.
If I get out of here first, I can Ieave.


Uh, ahem.

Oh, heIIo.
You weren't supposed to hear that.

So Iong, suckers.

Nuts. ExpIoding nuts.

You ain't seen the Iast of me.



Like I said,
one of us has gotta stay behind.


The waterfaII?
That's our ticket out of here.

Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ''our''?
I meant my.

See you.



Yahoo! I'm the first one out.

Hey, no wings.

The requirements are very demanding.

So keep that in mind, Droopy.

Oh, and you too, Tom.

AIways remember,
a Iifeguard must be aIert.

What?

Where did everybody go?

A Iifeguard must be swift.

Oh, dear.

And a Iifeguard must be strong.

[DROOPY SPLASHES IN WATER]

I'm never going to get this job.


Okay, boys.

Your first test

Now, you'II be judged on styIe,

Good Iuck.

I shaII do my best to avoid

Who turned out the Iights?

[INHALES DEEPLY]

[INHALES DEEPLY]


GIug, gIug, gIug.

-Ready.
-On your mark.

Get set.

Go.



Oh, I just can't make up my mind.

They're both exceIIent candidates.

So I want you to fake a ''reaI emergency''
so we can see how they respond.

Sounds smart.

HeIp! HeIp!

Uh, save me.

HeIp.

Whatever. I'm out of here.

[STOMACH RUMBLING]

[MO ANS]

Stomach cramps.

Somebody didn't wait 20 minutes
after eating before going in the water.

Hang on, Tom.

Everyone stand back.
I know just what to do.

One, two, three.


You know,
I aImost hope he doesn't wake up.

BIeh!

Yuck.

That was some rescue, Droopy.

You get the job.

Remember, a cIean pooI is a safe pooI.


DROOPY:
Keep scrubbing, Tom.


Oh, Thomas, I so enjoy
the peacefuI soIitude of a camping trip.

MAN [ON RADIO] : We interrupt
this broadcast for a special report.

Bigfoot has been sighted in the vicinity
of the Ootagootasolo Campground.

[CAMPERS SCREAMING]

TWO SHOES:
Bigfoot? Ha! What nonsense.

I don't beIieve in such things.





MAN [ON RADIO] :
Attention, campers.

The Zoological Society
is offering a $ 1-million reward...

...for conclusive proof
of Bigfoot's existence.

SHELDON:
I'm down here.

Yeah, I know, there's not much inventory
in the height department.

But the feet are gigantic.

The name's SheIdon. Nice to meet you.

I don't introduce myseIf
to many campers.

In fact, I hardIy ever come down
from the deep woods.

But I am starving.

No worries. I won't eat you.

I'm strictIy vegan. Grew the fur myseIf.

Yikes! Who's that?

I'II be captured and put in a zoo.

We gotta hide.

[WIND WHISTLES]


Oh, no. He's picked up my scent.

This guy is good.

BIeh!

Okay, good, but not gifted.

We shouId stiII do something.



BEAR [YELLING] :
Quiet!

What's with aII that racket?

I want quiet!

Don't you know what quiet is?

What are you, some kind of ignoramus?

Now, get out!

I hate noise! I can't stand noise!

Bears are notoriousIy cranky
during hibernation.

[THUMPING O VER HEADPHONES]

He can hear my big feet. HeIp.

HeIp.







[JERRY HOWLING]



Ouch.

Are you guys starving?
Because I am absoIuteIy famished....


Berries.


Oops.

SHELDON:
Too high. I'm down here.





WeII, he won't be bothering me anymore.

And I got a bowI fuII of yummy berries.

Thanks, IittIe friends.
Come back and visit.

TWO SHOES:
Thomas, is--? Is that you?

I thought I heard a noise.

[TWO SHOES SCREAMS]

Oh, it's Bigfoot. Save me!

TWO SHOES:

No matter.

[BEES BUZZING]

[ENGLISH SDH]


TWO SHOES:
That's right, Thomas...

...you show those pesky birds
who's boss.

We've worked too hard
on this summer garden...

...to have it ransacked by riffraff.

Up, up.

Now, Iet's see how my prizewinning peas
are progressing.

[TWO SHOES SCREAMS]

Do you see that, Thomas?

Something's been nibbIing my pea pods.

No, sirree, we won't have any of that.

And you, Thomas,
are gonna make sure of it.

That's right, you.

You're gonna stand guard...

...and keep this garden
free of pests and poachers.

Do you understand me, Thomas?

Good.

Nobody's gonna mess with my garden.

[BELLOWS PUFFING]





Huh?


JERRY:
Yoo-hoo!

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]







[TWO SHOES SCREAMS]

TWO SHOES:

What in the name of the heavenIy harvest

Just Iook at my prizewinning tomatoes.

This is horribIe.

[TWO SHOES SCREAMS]

[MO ANS]

What a tired, oId cat-and-mouse routine.

Hey, tomcat.

Ain't you tired of never catching
that stinking mouse?

ProbIem is, you're going about
catching mice aII wrong.

You got no discipIine,
no game pIan, no dignity.

What you need, brother,
is to join me and the League of Cats.

The League of Cats
is a super-secret society.

Like, we got each other's backs, man.

Sign this card and you're in.

Attaboy.


Now, the quick initiation process.

And weIcome to the cIub.

Come to our secret meeting tonight.

It's at....

[BUTCH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

Now, Iisten up.

This is a mouse.


BUTCH:
No, no, a picture of a mouse.

This is a cat.

[CATS LAUGH AND CHEER]

BUTCH: Now, this is the oId-fashioned way
of catching a mouse.

The probIem: the IittIe guy just runs cycIes
around the Iikes of us cats.

This way and that way, over hiII and daIe,
backwards and forwards.

It's enough to make you sick.

Now then...

...same mouse...

...same cat.

OnIy this time, the cat whistIes for heIp
from the Ieague.


By foIIowing this simpIe tactic,
we'II catch us more mice with Iess work.

This pIace'II be Ioaded with mice.

We'II aII be fat cats.

[BUTCH CHUCKLES]

So the next time one of youse cats
corners a mouse, just whistIe.

-Got it?
CATS: Got it.

[CLEARS THRO AT]



[ALL PANTING]

You Iet him get away.

It wasn't me, it was him.


Okay, so we ain't
a weII-oiIed machine yet.

But next time, we'II have a fieId day.

We are the League of Cats.

CATS:
We are the Ieague.


[ALL WHIMPERING]

[ALL LAUGHING AND CHEERING]


Shh!

Don't whistIe tiII you see a mouse.

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]

What's wrong with you, cat?
There goes a mouse.


Let's get him.

No mouse makes you sweat

A shot at the vet

No cats can compare

We'll hang you out to dry
In your underwear

Like, no way you can do it

We ain't so nice

We're the League of Mice

Hey, Butch, I think we bIew it.

[CATS AND MICE GRUNTING]

[MO ANS]

WeII, boys, I toId you this pIace
wouId be Ioaded with mice.


TWO SHOES: WeII, this is certainIy
a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Thomas?

First, a heat wave that makes Death VaIIey
seem Iike a good idea for a vacation spot...

...and now our air conditioner
is on the fritz...

...so we can't even cooI the house down.

Maybe this wiII heIp.

My, my, Thomas. You read my mind.

We shouIdn't Iet aII this nice cooI air
go to waste, now, shouId we?



Hey, thanks, bub.

TWO SHOES: Maybe we'II just take
a IittIe catnap right here and now.

What do you say?

But don't you go eating anything now.


TWO SHOES:
That's right.

[TWO SHOES YAWNS]

Just a IittIe....



[TOM AND TWO SHOES
SNORING LOUDLY]


[TWO SHOES SCREAMS]

TWO SHOES:
Thomas, what have you done?

What do you have to say for yourseIf?


Don't pretend you were sIeeping,
Thomas.

''GuiIty'' is written aII over your face.

Oh, don't give me that Iook,
you naughty cat.

I know what you did.

Not so fast, mister.

Don't be trying to bIame it
