I believe you are sincere
and good at heart

If you do not attain happiness always
remember that you are on the right road

try not to leave it. Above
all, avoid falsehood

every kind of falsehood,
especially falseness to yourself

teach us something useful

Watch over your own deceitfulness and
look into it every hour, every minute

avoid being scornful, both
to others and to yourself

What seems bad to you
within yourself will grow

pure by the very fact
of you observing it

-this is ridicilous
-we're paying for this

you're a disgrace

Avoid fear, though
fear is only the

consequence of every
sort of falsehood

Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love

Don't be frightened overmuch
even at your evil actions

I am sorry I can say nothing more
consoling to you, for love in

action is a harsh and dreadful thing
compared with love in dreams.

Love in dreams is greedy
for immediate action,

rapidly performed and
so everyone can see

Men will even give their lives if only
the ordeal does not last too long but

is soon over with all looking on
and applauding as if on a stage

But active love,
active love is labour

and fortitude

Dostoyevsky

so what was that all about?

that's what we're here to discuss

but you never discuss anything,
you just ask questions

we've been stuck on the same
paragraph for a month and a half

it's an important paragraph

read it

i believe you are sincere
and good at heart

if you do not
attain happiness

always remember
you are on the righ road

try not to leave it

a bove all, avoid
falsehood, every kind of

falsehood, especially
falseness to yourself

watch over your own
deceitfulness and

look into it every
hour, every minute

by the very fact of
your observing it

-what do you make of that?
-it's good advice man

-is it?
-you tell me

i don't know

but you're the teacher

i teach literature,
i dont give advice

you're wasting our time

i'm asking you questions

we're supposed to
ask the questions

you're supposed to
give us the answers

perhaps its not as
important to know

the answers as it is to ask
the questions better

there you see he told us something

no he didnt he just asked
us another question

Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love

Stop that!

what is father Zossima
trying to tell this woman?

I'm warning you man

is it possible to appreciate this advice
 if we aren't faithful?

tell me something! tell me something
 thats gonna help me pass the final exam

what do we mean when we use the word faith?

two coffees please

you can't beat up students beacause
they don't like Dostoyevsky

perhaps

-can you give a ride to town today?
-sure

are you okay?

Air's too cold, sun's too bright.
this coffee although i haven't had

any yet is undoubtedly too strong.
i wanna lie down and evaporate

you're having a crisis of faith

 -No i'm not
-Yes you are

Henry i'm an atheist

maybe you only think
you're an atheist

-i'm in pain
-all pain is desire

Is that criticism or advice?

i think its Buddhism

-Henry?
-yes?

-i'm in love
-no really?

yes i think so
how can you tell?

lack of concentration
erratic mood swings

faulty reasoning
obsessive behavior

its not like you to go running off
 after young women

i'm not running off after anyone
i'm falling towards her

-as if you cant help yourself?
-yea something like that

i see, i've read about this type of thing

and then there's this

love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing
compared with love in dreams

is this an active
love or a dream?

it's a dream about
to become reality

name the proofs of this reality

a thoughtful gesture,
delicate smile

white slender neck

an earnest inquisitive and alluring voice

greacful figure, intelligent sensuous eyes

-describe the nature of the dream
-intimacy

name the constituent elements of intimacy

kissing, caressing, holding

slapping, shouting, talking

waiting, sleeping, crying

listening, hoping, incouraging

forgiving, laughing, volanting

in a word: verbs

and therefore active

oh i feel much better now

 waitress are settling much prettier
 than i first came in

ambient shadows less irritating

daylight is not threatening me anymore
 it's just there

filling the street for
no apparent reason

a mistake perhaps but in
any event i'm not afraid

-glad to hear it
-check please

how do you proceed?

to live just move forward
towards those you love

-intriguing theory
-no an impeccable truth

but knowledge wont
help where you're going

what will?

-faith
-you mean love

no faith

whats the distinction between
 faith and love?

love without faith is merely a infatuation

infatutaion

such a beautiful word

my friend you're doomed

perhaps, so why do you
need to go into town?

-i've been thrown out of school
-No

well what are you going to do?

i dont know maybe i'll get a job

-well if there's anything you need just ask
-thanks

-so i'll see in the parking lot at 4
-okay

well here goes

desperate, his
frustration spills

no bursts forth

thats better

his frustration bursts
forth into audacity

he says as fast as he can

whatever he feels

he says as fast as he
can whatever he feels

he feels hurt and speaks pain

i like that very
direct, passionate

he feels

he concludes

he likes you

-who?
-your literature professor

oh yes i know

you shouldnt get mixed
up with him people will

think you sleep with him
to get a better grade

people are disapointing

let me intruduce you to Mark

i dont want to get involved
with anyone right now

why not?
because i'm busy

i have a lot to study and i'm
enjoying it, working hard

but Mark is so good
looking and he likes you

-he fascinates me a little
-Mark?

No my teacher

Really?

there's something sort of tragic
about him don't you think?

he's name is Jude like in <i>Jude The Obscure</i>

-he looks half mad
-he's in love

Men are pathetic

i think he's kind of charming

in a way

i write about him

what do you write about?

different things,
speculate, study him

i'm going to write a short story with
him at the center or some one like him

<i>Him</i> that's what i call it
<i>Him</i>

-i'm doing laundry tonight
-me too

do you want to split a
bottle of detergent?

okay

thanks for the ride

where you gonna stay?

oh i have some friends
who will put me up

-i'll see you later
-see you around

marry me? come on

excuse me sir but will you
take my hand in marriage?

-come on get outta here
-marry me please

to love and to cherish

to love and to cherish

would you get out of the street?

what are you looking at?
square.. bug off

excuse me sir but will you
allow me to be your wife?

-please!
-here

don't want your money

to love and to cherish

hey you marry me
come on

somebody need any help?

somebody need any assistance?

can i help some one?

somebody need any help?

can i help some one?

my manager says you either
gotta buy a book or leave

listen to this

ignorance is the necessary
condition of  human happiness

we're almost entirely
ignorant of ourselves

absolutely of others in
ignorance we find our bliss

in illusions our happiness

i write down all those
questions you ask in class

 you do?

i take them home and re-read the
chapters you've assigned, it helps

what does?
asking the questions

how?

submitting all i read in the book
to that ongoing list of questions

somehow it shows

it shows how consistent
his concerns were

Dostoevsky

it does huh?

before i began asking
those questions over

and over again of the text
i was having a hard time

i couldn't see what he was getting at
i kept hoping he get back to the story

and then what happened?

the questions focused my concentration
i'm getting more out of my reading now

does anybody work here?

i can't say i intended to teach you
anything but i'm glad it helps

but they're your
questions you asked them first

i asked them for
different reasons

what reasons?

the book seems alive

you seem alive

that book there seems alive too

things you're reading are
having an effect on you

me? i read

i understand, i appreciate

but still i'm left unchanged

i can't put into actions
what it is i understand

shouldn't knowledge
provide solace?

i don't know

perhaps i don't
understand anything

do you have anywhere to go?

you've been in here for hours

when do you get off work?

8 o'clock

can i drive you back to campus?

no thanks i take the bus

will you have a drink with
me before you take the bus?

okay but only if you leave now my
manager will yell at me if you don't

okay the bar on the corner?

do you wanna buy the book?

nah books don't help

to love and to cherish

what's that?

it's coffee and a muffin

what's this suppose to mean?

it's not suppose to mean anything

you can't get something for
nothing you know mister

no not usually i suppose

just because a guy buys
a girl a cup of coffee

doesn't mean she has to
jump into the sack with him

look i'm putting it over here

why buy the cow when you
can get the milk for free?

what?

that's the truth
about things mister

look it's right here see?

coffee and a muffin okay?

to love and to cherish

marry me

excuse me?

let me be you wife

 i'm sorry

to love and to cherish

hey professor you waiting for somebody?

yeah a girl

pretty girl?

yes. a pretty girl

and young too i imagine

what's it to you?

you admire her inteligence

as a matter of fact yes i do

and you're impressed with
her charming combination

of unassuming conscientiousness
and girlish naivete

so what if i am?

trouble with us americans is we always
want a tragedy with a happy ending

hey i need a beer

Hi
Hi

you want a drink?

a beer please i
have to make a call

a beer

a beer

Joe it's me Sophie

i won't be home for an hour
so sorry something came up

i'll do my laundry
tomorrow night

i'm at a bar with some friends

girlfriends

bye

do you like your job?

it's okay i get a discount
on my books it helps

do you like yours?

not really i'm bad at it

are you bad at it because
you don't like it or

do you not like it
because you're bad at it?

do you think i'm a bad teacher?

i have learn things in your class

you're a better student
than i am a teacher

that's because you give me
more attention than the others

that's true

does that bother you?

no

to tell you the truth

when i feel i'm teaching well

when i'm making myself clear

when i'm actually incouraging a
student to think specifically

and articulate
more appropriately

when i feel this

i'm usually thinking of you

does that embarrass you?

a little

when i'm reading that really
excites me for instance

i want desperately to
share it with some one

it's you i wanna share it with

why me?

it's complicated

no it's not

it's not?

it's because you
think i'm pretty

perhaps

i'm sorry it doesn't change
the fact that i care for you

you hardly know me

that's true i hardly know anyone but i
know how i feel even if i don't know why

would you like me to tell
you something about myself?

if you want to

i appreciate being taken seriously
but i'm always concerned

that i'm not
sufficiently serious

i know men look at me and think
i'm alright but i think it's

contemptuous to utilize that
fact in order to achieve something

but if had to i'm afraid i might

and that bothers me

i'm very curious and i'm
afraid of seeming gullible

so i'm argumentative more
than i think i should be

what did you lie to your roommate
you were out with some one else?

if people knew we were out
together they would say

i was sleeping with you in
order to get a better grade

but we're not
not what

sleeping together

not yet anyway

one..two..three..four
five..six..seven..eight

i don't like this song
i love the video

can you turn it down i have to study?

that guy called again
what guy?

you the one
the one you like?

with the long hair

did he ask you out?
yes

but i said i was busy
do you think he'll call back?

definelty

i wish i had legs like hers

i wish my breasts were smaller

do you like this dress?

i like that one better

i'm going to write a novel

now?
no someday

can i help someone?
somebody need any help?

somebody need
any assitance?

can i help someone?
somebody need any help?

can i help someone?

you weren't in class today
i've missed you

i've missed you too

it was terrible i
didn't know what to do

i overslept

my class is a 2 o'clock
in the afternoon

let's not argue

i'm not arguing i'm concerned

are you eating alright?

look i'm a grownup person

can i see you tonight?
perhaps

what's that suppose to mean?

it's what you always say

is it?
yes perhaps

when do i say that?

well for instance whenever you don't
want to admit that you're wrong

you always look away
and say perhaps

no i don't
yes you do

i always admit when i'm wrong

that's not true

yes it is i cherish my flaws

ah you see that's another
thing you always do

what is?

whenever you're losing an argument

you always depict yourself
as hopelessly incompetent

as if humbly admiting
your shortcomings

somehow places you above
the argumentative hand

there for negating the other
person's point of view entirely

you're pretty thorough

honestly observent

i'm pretty flattered
i'll make a note of that

you haven't answer my question

what question is that?

can i see you tonight?
perhaps

i've gotta go call me

Henry
oh hi Jude

what are you doing here?

i work here now

no kidding
yea

great job, all these books

boss doesn't like
me too much but

i always had a problem
with authority

what are you doing here?

oh i came to see Sophie

ahh Sophie

Sophia that's greek you
know it's means to know

i'll keep that in mind

but she's got a boyfriend

no she doesn't
sure she does

lots of 'em, they're in here everyday
she flirts with them constantly

no she would've told me if she
were involved with some one

why?
why what?

why would she have told you?

because she would have wanted me
to know we are close you know

how close?
close

do you sleep together?
no not yet

so you're just friends

we're a little bit
more than friends

Jude you're deluding yourself

you don't know anything about it

a man'll throw all his heart won wisdom
toss away years of aquired knowledge

all for what? a pretty face

well what is all your
deligent cynicism and

years of intellectual
inquiry gotten you huh?

a job in a bookstore

piece of mind
what?

or atleast something
approximating piece of mind

you don't live in the real
world henry you live in books

and ideas you're a victim
of theoretical abstraction

hey i struggle with my
demons as much as you

 but are they
really demons?

all distractions are demons

you know my biggest fear is this

that all my hard work
all my good intentions

all my studying have
been nothing more than

bulding of a wall
between me and life

extacly
what?

you must withdraw from life

don't be stupid i wanna embrace life

to know about life sometimes
you have step away from it

oh yeah? listen to this

''yet, every now and then, there would pass
a young girl, slender, fair and desirable

arousing in young men a not ignoble
desire to possess her, and stirring

in old men regrets for ecstasy
not seized and now forever past''

he is quiet
yet opinionated

powerful but shy

i need new clothes

thoughtful and impetuous

i hate this video
i like this song

the lead singer is hot

he looks mean and insensitive

do you think i should
make my hair blonde?

not untill summer

i wanna lose weight

is Marguerite Duras a lesbian?

god i hope Mike calls me back

he is solemn despite himself

reckless and hell bent

freightened of his own carelessness

that's a pradox

hello?
get outta here

it's my mother

how are you?

Jude?

i'm a wreck

excuse me?

i'm excited too excited to sleep

where are you?
on a street

in town?

i've been walking for hours

i had to walk, think i'm
gonna walk all night

why don't you come out
and walk with me?

what's come over you?

i can't get you out of my head

i'll drive up to campus and pick
you up we stay out all night

i can't
why not?

i've got classes tomorrow
i've gotta study

so what! i wrote a poem for you

a poem?

yea
really?

yea i was at a bar

i was possessed, inspired beyond
belief i grabbed a napkin

scrolled it out in one
huge burst of creativity

beautiful poem really beautiful

and then i spilled my bear on it and
now i don't remember how it went

meet me at the cafe in an hour

Henry
Jude

ive decided i'm joing
the priesthood

you always say that when
you've had too much to drink

yeah this time i mean it

what about your job
at the bookstore?

i got fired

jesus Henry monastery is
probably just the place for you

think so?

you are socially retarded

i march to the beat
of a different drum

you got any money?

i don't need money
i got conviction

well here this will help
sustain your conviction

you know Jude that's your problem
you don't believe in anything

that's a problem?

ofcourse it is

it seems to me the people who
believe in things are the problem

how do you mean?

people who bomb embassies usually
insist that they believe in things

rival terrorist organizations machine gun
women and children in the supermarkets

because they believe in things

elected officials shut down
hospitals and then vote for

increases in the defence budget
usually because believe in things

no i rather not
believe in things

but what's the alternative?

man can't live without faith

he can live without faith he can't
live without understanding

faith comes after
understanding

and how do you suppose
one gains understanding?

through exprience

ah you wanna achieve spiritual
end through materialist means

that's your problem

Henry leave me
alone you're drunk

you won't listen to reason

no i won't listen to
reason not tonight

but you must
don't try and stop me Henry

you'll never survive this

how do you know?

besides i don't
know if i want to

are you okay?

i don't know maybe i'll
never be the same again

but who cares?

kiss me

why did you tell your roommate
it was your mother on the phone?

i told you why
but it's different now

how is it different?

it's understood that you're not
here in order to get a better grade

isn't?

well yes it is

between us

no one else matters

i'm embarrassed

of me?

i don't want to seem like somebody i'm not

to who?

to myself

you should go

i don't want to

you don't know why you're here

people often do things
they don't understand

it doesn't make
them less genuine

maybe

do you want me to go?

no

are you sure?

yes

i'm going to undress

okay

do you think i'm very beautiful?

yes

if you never see me
again after tonight

will you be sad?

don't worry about it

yes but you know

will you be tortured by the
memory of having been with me?

of having caressed me

will you wonder if
i'm with other men?

will you be jealous?

will you become obssessed?

will you carry your disappointment
around with you forever?

will you be maudlin
and anti-social?

will you get into fights?

will you expect other women
to be somehow more like me?

my mouth my eyes

the way i wear my hair

will you? will you be
like that you think?

perhaps

it's the nature of
things you know

regret

i'll risk it

hey will you marry me?

please

why do you wanna marry me?

why not?

i can think a lot of reasons
if i weren't so drunk

why are you so drunk?

i don't know,
nights are too long

the nights are too long because you
have no one to share them with

that's a very compassion
way of putting it

marry me
but i don't know you

what does that matter? does
anyone really know anyone else?

ah that's a good point

i'd go a step further and ask does
anybody really know themselves?

exactly

what's your name?

Katy

glad to meet you Katy, Henry
how are you Henry?

wasted

so what do you say
will you marry me?

well i doubt we can get married right
here in the middle of the night

we could if we were in Reno
yea

god i wish we lived in Reno

let's sleep on it

no way mister why buy the cow when
you can get the milk for free?

what?
you know what i mean

we don't have to
sleep on it together

why? don't you think i'm beautiful?

Katy you're a goddess

listen pal don't waste my time
there are plenty of men out there

who died trying to marry me

i don't doubt it

listen why don't we just get
engaged for the time being?

engaged huh?
yea

that way i can find us a place
to live get set up right and proper

 why don't you
have a place to live now?

no not exactly

what about a ring?
a ring?

a ring if we're gonna get engaged
you gotta give me a ring

oh ring here, it's my college ring

oh god

it's beautiful
it's a little big on you

oh no it's just perfect
henry thank you

aw it's worth just to see
you smile like that Katy

so do you have a job?

a job? ahh no not at the moment

i'm working on my PhD

you're a doctor?

of theology. almost

what are you gonna do when
you get out of school?

ooh i don't know i've been in school all
my life i don't know how to do anything

well i hope you don't
expect me to go

and support you for the
rest of your life?

already with the nagging

what a torturous path
i've made for myself

shackling myself to you

oh Katy now don't get so upset

all newlyweds have these
little battles we'll survive

you think so?
absolutely

you're a good man Henry

Ah Kate come on let's go
home and get some sleep

okay i know a place
good

his weaknesses

are enduring

his strengths

threathen to eclipse

my own self confidence

he eats out

a lot

hey aren't you?
no

yes you are
no i'm not

but last night
what about last night?

you were with him

no i wasn't

i'm sorry perhaps i'm mistaking

perhaps

i just saw your girlfriend

 Sophia

she claims not to know you

no
yes

NO

afraid so

i don't understand

there's nothing to
understand we're animals

"Eros is a bad and fickle little godhead"

does this thing still work?

i hate when she does that

today's the first day of spring

that's no consultation

boy i must've been hammered
last night i woke up in a strange apartment

somehow i managed to
lose my college ring

eat your toast and get out

no love is free
what?

freud said that

don't start with me Henry

heard a fascinating statement
in a movie last night

you don't seem to be aware
of the pain i'm expriencing

excuse me?
forget it

it's biblical
what is?

the statement, "love
does not discriminate"

i don't follow

and the people asked him saying:

"what shall we do then"

that's Luke
chapter 3 verse 10

so?
"so the apostle replies

love and cherish unquestioningly
whoever happens to be before you

Love does not discriminate"

I'm no apostle, Henry

Take it easy, it was just
something I heard in a movie

Listen pal, you can't
waltz in here, use my toaster

and start spouting universal
truths without qualification!

what's that?

what?

you smell that?

oh yeah

she's left her fragrance here

that's it. Get out!

what about my toast?
Get out!

Scram
what?

why did you do that?

i'm upset i guess

idiot

why do you deny me?

i don't wanna get involved
with anyone right now

 i'm busy

studying working hard

and i like it

why do you need what's
between us to be seen?

i don't

i need it to be acknowledged

this is embarrassing

what are you writing?

it's part of a story

can i hear it?

no

read it

read it

he is desperate and his
frustration mounts to overflowing

before giving way to his
final and audacious mistake

finaly he caves in
gives up

and takes what is offered because he
knows he can because he knows he wants

he lacks faith and
therefore patience

the giving of himself has left him
empty and old before his time

that's very interesting

but i think it should be a woman

what do you think?

go on read it as a woman

she is desperate and her
frustration mounts to overflowing

before giving way to her
final and audacious mistake

finaly she caves in, gives up
and takes what is offered

because she knows she can
because she knows she wants

she lacks faith and
therefore patience

the giving of herself has left her
empty and old before her time

just don't

damn

excuse me miss

what do you want?

i want you to be my wife

what?

i mean it. marry me. please

why should i marry you?

well why not me?

listen mister i'm
already engaged

see? this is an engagement ring

that's not an engagement ring

that's a college ring and it
belongs to my friend Henry

Back off pal

i don't know anyone named Henry
this is an engagement ring

a significant emblem
a potent piece of jewelry

and it's mine

but i thought you
wanted to get married

i just wanted somebody to ask

Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky

born in moscow 1821

his father was a

drunken brute of an army Surgeon
who treated his sowers horribly

so he... they murdered him by pouring vodka
down his throat till he gagged

Fyodor had some success
with his first novel but

then he was arrested for
subversion against Tsar

after 8 months in
solitary confinement

he was led before a firing squad

he stood there in a death shroud

facing an open and hastily dug
grave awaiting his execution

then some one decided he
didn't need to be shot

so for the next 4 or 5 years he did hard
labour in some cold siberian prison

it was there in siberia that he
began to suffer from epilepsy

finally 10 years after being
dragged away in chains

he returned to Saint Petersburg

he converted to a conservative and
profoundly religious philosophy

nevertheless he was
utterly destitute

an alcoholic and a
compulsive gambler

he married Anna Dostoyevskaya

and wrote atleast 4 of the
greatest novels in history

i have nothing else to say

i can't teach you anything

class dismissed

Knowing is not enough

pal you alright?

yeah i'll be okay

just let me rest my head here in
the gutter for 5 or 10 minutes

 i'll be alright

i'm sorry to bother you

what is it?

can you tell me how to get
down to the river from here?

does anyone need any assistance?

anyone need any assistance?

can i help someone?

somebody need any help?

can i help someone?

someone need any assistance?

can i help someone?

can i help someone?

somebody need any help?

someone need any assistance?

can i help someone?

someone need any help?

does anyone need any assistance?

can i help someone?

can i help someone?

can i help someone?
