X-O-T,

F-D-E.

And the next set?

R-E-D,

O-Z-F.

Okay.

Uh, Eunice.

How many of those letters
can you actually see

and how many have you memorised?

I can see all of them, Dr Avery.

Eunice...

Okay. I memorised the last two, Tom.
Only the last two.

If I can't get my license renewed...

Eunice, you need to wear
the lenses I prescribed.

Contact lenses don't work for me
and glasses give me headaches.

Then we'll change the prescription,

but you know the DMV's gonna
test you again anyway.

I've memorised those charts, too.

her appointment for tomorrow.

Bill Warren wants to know if he can
see you before he goes in for work,

which means you have to be here
at 8:00 a.m.

Okay.
Okay for 8:00?

Yeah.
Oh.

Roger called while you were in
with a patient.

He said if you miss the 2:00 tee time,
you pay for the beer.

I pay for the beer anyway.

And Daniel called and left a message
here on the voicemail last night.

What'd he say?
He said he'll call back.

He said he's somewhere in France
and he sounded good.

I mean, how do you not sound good
if you're in France, right?

Did he leave a number this time?

No.

Everyone on the planet has
a mobile phone except my son.

What the hell's the matter
with that kid?

The world on Daniel's terms.

See you.
(phone ringing)

Oh, no!

(chuckling)
(groaning)

Let me show you
how a real doctor does it.

Since when is Tom
not a real doctor, Rog?

The eyes are the most important organ
in the body, Roger.

(chuckles) Maybe at your age, Tom.
They're the windows to the soul.

Yeah? How the hell would Roger know?
He doesn't have one.



to me, boys.

Don't use your foot wedge, Phil!
I got your foot wedge, Roger.

All right, what do we got, about 70?

Yeah, plus 10 to the flag.

That's what I'm talking about.
You like that?

It'll play.
That's good stuff.

I'm over there.

Yeah, I see. It's about three feet away.
You want a ride or what?

I'm old and tired.

You're old and lazy.
I don't see you walking this course.

(mobile ringing)

It's mine and it can wait.

Get... (exclaiming)


Go ahead and putt out.
I'll catch up with you. Hello?

(man speaking French)

Yes, hello?

(man inquiring in French)

I'm sorry. I don't speak French.

I am Captain Henri Sebastian
of the National Gendarmerie

in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France.

Is something wrong?
Are you the father of Daniel Avery?

Yes, I am.

I'm sorry to inform you
that your son has been killed, sir.

What?

What do you mean?

Daniel? Something happened to Daniel?

He was caught in a storm

on the Camino de Santiago, monsieur.

I don't even know where that is.

It's in the French Pyrenees.

He was on pilgrimage.

Tom?

Tommy?

Where you going?

Tommy?

(Father Sandoval)
I'm sorry for your loss, Tom.

Thanks, Father.

I'm going overseas to bring Daniel home.

Would you like to pray with me, Tom?

What for?

All the information
for your itinerary is in here.

I cancelled all your appointments
for next week, so...

He wanted to see the world.

And he did.


You should fly with me.
Yeah, right.

Turn the car around. Pack a bag.

Grab your passport.
Forget your golf clubs.

Come on, a father-son trip.
It'll be fun.

When you coming back?

I don't know.

So you don't have a plan.

We agreed that if I let you
take me to the airport,

you wouldn't lecture me about
how I'm ruining my life.

I lied.

You know, most people don't have
the luxury of just picking up

and leaving it all behind, Daniel.

Well, I'm not most people.

If I don't have your blessing,
that's fine.

But don't judge this. Don't judge me.

My life here might not seem
like much to you,

but it's the life I choose.

You don't choose a life, Dad.

You live one.

(man announcing on speaker in French)

(people chattering)

Mr. Avery?
Yes.

We spoke on the phone.

Captain Henri Sebastian.
Of course.

I don't know why, I know it's odd, but
I thought it would say something else.

It's the same word back home.
I guess I thought it would be different.

Mr. Avery, if you are not ready
to do this,

it can wait.
No.

It's fine. I mean, it's not fine.
I mean, I'm okay.

Let's get it over with.
Let's just get it over with.

(zipper closing)

These are Daniel's belongings.

(thanking in French)

This is everything he had
when we found him.

What happened?
It was an accident.

The weather in the Pyrenees is famous
for being unpredictable

and I'm sure Daniel would have been
warned by the locals.

You were not close with him?

Not since his mother died,
I'm sorry to say.

What was he doing out there?

He was on pilgrimage on the Camino.

Walking the road
to Santiago de Compostela.

People from very different backgrounds,
faiths and generations

have walked the path from here
in the French Pyrenees

to Santiago de Compostela,

800 kilometers
on the north-western coast of Spain,

for over a thousand years.

We believers are told
that the remains of St James,

the apostle of Jesus,
are interred there.

And so we make pilgrimage.

This is what your son Daniel was doing.

Why he was alone?

to make the trek alone.

The Way is a very personal journey,
Mr. Avery.

This is the shell.

The symbol of the pilgrim
making the journey.

And this...

This is Daniel's passport
for the Camino.

It is to be officially stamped

at every important stop
along the route through Spain.

And the first stamp is here,
in Saint-Jean.


(thanking in French)


the passport should look like this.

I have walked the Camino
to the Atlantic Ocean three times.

There and back.

I will do it once more,
on my 70th birthday.

God willing, of course.

Daniel was my only child.

We can also offer cremation

if that is a more suitable way for you
to transport the remains back home.

(speaking broken French)

I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Oh, do you mind if I sit here?

Because there's
no other seats available.

Hi. I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam.

Tom.
Hey, Tom.

I saw you on the train this morning.

We came from Paris.
We were on the same train.

You're not a pilgrim, are you?

A pilgrim? A trekker? A peregrino? Huh?

You're not here to walk
the Santiago de Compostela.

No, I'm here on family business.
Ah.

Well, it's not for everyone, you know.

In fact, somebody died
on the Camino this week,

only one day into the trek.

Yeah, such a tragedy.

Yes.

But it's no mystery
why I'm doing this trek.

You see this gut?

My older brother is getting married
in Rotterdam in December

and I want to fit into my old suit.

You could just buy a new suit.

No, but it's the third time
that he's getting married.

But wedding or not, I mean...
A bit leaner, a bit lighter.

It would make my doctor

and my wife a bit happier.

No? Ah!

(thanking in French)

Oh!

It's for energy.


My doctorate...

I'm not gonna finish it.

You mean this year?

I mean ever.

I can't learn about the world in school.

(Tom chuckling) You're not just
in school. You're at Berkeley.

Take a semester off, sure,

but don't throw away
the last 10 years of your life.

you travelled abroad?

And I'm not talking about for business.

Nepal. Morocco.

India. Papua New Guinea. Europe.

I gotta go to these places.
I gotta go. I gotta go.


Captain.
Mr. Avery.

I want to cremate the body.

(mortician bidding good night in French)

I'm gonna walk the Camino to Santiago.

Mr. Avery, if you pardon me, please,
you are not prepared to go on this trek.

You have no equipment or...
I've got Danny's backpack

and all his stuff.
But you haven't trained for this walk.

And no disrespect,
you are more than 60 years old.

So it'll take me a bit longer than most.

You will be lucky if you finish
in two months.

Then I'd better get started.

We're leaving in the morning.

"We"?

Both of us.


Okay.

Here we go.

(horn honking)

Came to give me
another pep talk, Captain?

I came to wish you buen Camino,
Mr. Avery.

And to give you this.

Is this a good-luck charm?
Something like that.

You'll know what to do with it
when you get there.

Get where?
Cruz de Ferro. It's on the Camino.

You'll be there a month from now.

You can read about it in the guide.

It's a place of much significance.

Mr. Avery, do you know why
you are walking the Way?

I suppose I'm doing it for Daniel.

You walk the Way for yourself.
Only for yourself.

Well, then, I guess
I don't have a clue, Captain.

Mr. Avery,

I have also lost a child.

I wish you a buen Camino.
Enjoy your pilgrimage. Both of you.

Thank you.

Tom.

This is the way.



(sheep bleating)

(ringing bell)

Peregrino! Shh!

Sorry.

Are you American?
Yes.

Americans are always late.

Well. You speak English.

So do you.

It's my first time in Spain.

You are not only in Spain.
You are in the Basque Country.

We are in Navarra.

Well, is there a room
in the Basque Country in Navarra?

A room? You mean a bed?

A bed, a room, it's all the same.
I'm very tired.

15 euros for a bed and food.
But it's late, so no food.

No more cooking.

No food, but still 15 euros?

Yes.
(chuckling) Okay.

Shoes here.

(man snoring)

Bathroom there.

You're here.

Welcome to Roncesvalles. Buenas noches.

(man shushing)

(men snoring)

(men coughing)

(coughing continues)

(wrapper rustling)


Pardon me, sir.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

I followed the same route as you
to a point,

but then I detoured at Valcarlos.

And that's why I got here
a couple of hours before you.

My guidebook didn't say anything
about any detours.

Yeah, but that's because you haven't
got the Dutch guidebook.

The Dutch guidebook?
Yep.

Because we Dutch, we're always trying
to find the quickest way

to get to the next party.

Because you know what they say,
"If it ain't Dutch, it ain't much."

Did the old woman feed you?
No.

Well, you're lucky.
The meal was as grim as the beds.

Here. Have this.

No, I can't take your food.
Yeah, you can.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Pamplona in a couple of days.

Hemingway, running of the bulls,
all that.

I think I might stay there for...
Peregrinos!

No drugs here! I know what I smell!

I will call the Guardia Civil!

Yeah.
I will call the police!

Yeah.
Yeah!

(mutters in Dutch)

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah!

What did she mean, drugs?

Oh, nothing.

Well, nothing by Dutch standards.

Just a little tobacco booster.

To help with sleep.

You want some, Tom?
No. Thank you.

Sure?

I'm sure.

Here.

I also have these options.

Ambien, earplugs.


(people chattering)

I know you've got a thing
for Dutch men, seÃ±ora.

Have you ever walked the Camino, seÃ±ora?

No, never.

When I was young, I was too busy.

And now that I am older,

I'm too tired.

Buen Camino.

Hey, Tom, we should get a coffee here
before we go.

Just to get our motor running, no?

Yeah, we'll have a quick coffee.

Oh, look! A cheese maker, Tom!


Come on, Tom!

You haven't lived until you have
goat cheese from these mountains.

(greeting in Spanish)

Are you gonna make it, fat man?

Don't you worry about me, old man.

Hey, Tom. When we met in Saint-Jean, you
said nothing about going on pilgrimage.

I wasn't going on pilgrimage.

But here we are.

Yeah.

You said you were on family business?

I am.

But you have all the equipment
for the walk to Santiago.

Yeah.

Tom, that box with the ashes...

My son.

I'm done for the day, Joost.
I'm staying here tonight.

Here? In this village?
Yeah.

But Pamplona's a stone's throw away.

My feet are killing me.
I gotta get out of these shoes.

I'm sorry, but not me, man.

Pamplona beckons!
Okay.

It's been a pleasure, Tom.

Hey, uh, buen Camino.

(all chattering)

Ah!

(greeting in Spanish)

I don't speak Spanish.
We were expecting you.

Expecting me?

You are a pilgrim, sÃ­?
Yes.

We are always expecting pilgrims.

Come, we have plenty of beds
and your food is still warm.

Hey, the Americans are here!


Bueno, bueno, bueno!

Come. Vamos. Come on.

(â™« The Star-Spangled Banner)

(Don Santiago) The truth of the matter
is confused.

No, Charlemagne had other ideas.

To extend his empire.

He crossed the Pyrenees,
but nothing worked out as he intended.

This is Spain!

This is Basque Spain!

He tortured the Basques of Pamplona

and allowed his men to have
a little too much

rest and relaxation with our women.

When the Basque shepherds,
who lived around here,

heard what happened in Pamplona,

they slipped into the woods,
and we, we Basques, killed them.

Sorry, monsieur,

but based on what I have read here,

that is complete crap. D'accord?

You won't find much truth in this book.

Charlemagne. Roland.
Not "Rolan", Roland.

This is part of French history, okay?

No, not Basque!
(agreeing in French)

The French don't want to admit
that the death of Roland

was because of Charlemagne's
un-Christian intentions.

Come on! Allez!

(bids good night in French)
(man laughing)

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Night.
Wait a minute. SeÃ±or, seÃ±or.

I thought it was the Arabs
that killed Roland.

(Don Santiago groaning)

(guests laughing)

(guests chattering)

One of the guys said you're Canadian.

Don't spread it around, eh?

So how's it going for you out there
on the road, Boomer?

I'm Tom.

You know, as in "baby boomer".

You got all those horrible signs

of that desperate generation
taking its final breath,

trying to screw the rest of us over
one last time.

Only thing missing from you, Boomer,
is one of those stupid-looking ponytails

and a collection of James Taylor songs
on your iPod.

I like James Taylor,

but I don't have an iPod.

Well, that's pretty amazing. What?

No iPod, no cell phone
or computer to keep you connected?

Isn't it written somewhere
in the Baby Boomer Code Book

that you must own a certain percentage
of anything Steve Jobs makes?

So what is it?
On pilgrimage to change your life?

Something like that.
Wait. Don't tell me.

Just getting over a nasty divorce
and she took it all?

Or maybe you're out
to meet some young chicks

and relive your college glory days.

Believe me, I've seen plenty
of that nonsense.

Oh, I got it. You're seeking penance

for screwing over your company retirees
in some stock market scandal.

You sound really angry.

Yeah. Sure. I'm angry.

I gotta quit these

and I'm really, really angry about that.

And when we get
to Santiago de Compostela,

it's all over for you, my little friend.
You're a goner.

The end of the Camino
is the end of my addiction.

Spoken like a true addict.

Spoken like someone who took 10 days
to get this far.

Well, at that pace you should get
to Santiago by the end of the year.

He's onto our plan.

But, you know...
(guests singing drunkenly)

(Don Santiago exclaiming)

(thanking in Spanish)


I wanted to be a bullfighter.

My father wanted me to be a lawyer.

I became neither.

Coffee is in the common area.

Bonjour, Americano!

I thought you might be staying
at least a few more days here, eh?

Funny.

These European guys are starting
to get a little familiar.

I want to get out of here while they're
still sleeping off their hangover.

Besides, I got all the friends I need.
Don't want any tagalongs, so...

Well, be safe out there.


Good luck with the quitting.
(chuckles) Yeah.

Good luck with whatever it is
you're doing out here.

We're all just taking
a really long walk, I suppose.

That's one way to look at it.

Oh!

I do have a cell phone.

Yeah, well,

me, too.

And an iPod.

Sorry for being such an ass last night.

I'm out here to get away from everything
and you just...

Reminded you of it.

Yeah, I get it.

Well...

You're all right, Boomer.

Even if you do like James Taylor.

(â™« Country Road by James Taylor)

I'm gonna need you to cancel
all my appointments

for the rest of the month, Doreen.

Oh, no!

(animal howls)

(footsteps approaching)

Buen Camino.
(greeting in Spanish)

Tom!

Tom, it's me!

Tom, it's Joost! From Amsterdam!

It's cordero.

Spain is famous for its roast lamb. Mmm!

Here. You should try some.
No. Thank you.

Much to my dismay,

Pamplona is just an ordinary Spanish
city when the bulls are not running.

So much for being a party town.

But I've made reservations
to return here in July

during the week of fiestas.

The Sanfermines!

I would like to propose a toast.

'Cause we Dutch love to propose toasts.

That we agree to meet here in July

and run with the bulls, like real men.

Like real crazy men.

Well, I'm gonna come back.

Wine shots, huh?
(coughs) Yeah.

What are your plans?

To move through Pamplona quickly,
and as long as I'm sitting here,

I might just order some tapas.

SeÃ±or!
They're called pintxos.

I beg your pardon, Joost.
In Pamplona they're called tapas.

Here in Pamplona, it's "tapas".
I just read that.

You see, unlike the Dutch guidebook,

which may be directing you
to the nearest party,

the American guidebook is designed
so that you don't look like a clown

if you order "pintxos" when you
really mean "tapas."

SeÃ±or?
Tom.

SeÃ±or? Algo mÃ¡s?

Tapas, por favor.

Tapas? AquÃ­no hay "tapas".

No hay tapas?
No, no, no.

"Tapas" es mÃ¡s de Madrid, del Sur.

AquÃ­estamos en Navarra,
en Navarra, son los pintxos.

(explaining in Spanish)

Quiere pintxos?

Oh, look!

It's Tom Quixote and Sancho Panza.

you Dulcinea.

Buen Camino, fellow pilgrim.

Buen Camino. My name is Joost.
I'm from Amsterdam.

Dutch, huh? Got any drugs?

Oh, I love this girl!
It wears off quick, I promise.

You know each other?
Sort of.

What are you looking to score?
Something for sleep.

I've had trouble sleeping for the past,
I don't know, couple of years.

Do you folks mind doing this drug deal
while we walk?

I've got some Ambien.

Or something stronger
if that's your pleasure.

I love this guy!

It wears off quick, I promise.

Come. Come with us.
Oh!

Tom, wait.

I tried to quit once.
But then I thought, "why?"

My grandmother, she drank
and she smoked her entire life

and she lived to be 103 years old.
Now what does that tell you?

It tells me that everyone
who is trying to quit something

always has an ancient relative they use
as an example of why not to quit.

I suppose that makes me a clichÃ©, then.
You said it.

But I'm not the one trying
to quit anything.

Yeah, well...

We keep walking at this pace,

quitting isn't gonna be the problem.

Surviving will be.

Doesn't this guy ever stop
to smell the flowers?


This isn't a race.
No, it isn't.

Then why does it piss me off so much

that I haven't seen him
stop to take a break?

Why does something that should be
inspirational make me so

angry?

Totally irrational.

The same could be said
for this entire journey.

Wonder how old he is.
Older than us.

Hey, Tom!

You think I'll look like this
by the time I get to Santiago?

Yeah, sure, Joost.

Just keep eating that cordero.

Nothing like a few pounds of lamb
to help shed the excess weight.

But it's part of
the Camino experience, no?

I mean, you can't come to Spain
without having their roast lamb.

(reading in Spanish)

"Where the path of the wind
crosses that of the stars."

What do you think the waist is
on this guy?

32?

More like a 25 or 26.

Well, a man can dream.

(cyclist ringing bell)

What? You can do this on a bike?

Why the hell are we walking?

Oh, that's ridiculous, man.

Try that. It's super strong.
I brought it from Amsterdam.

It's really good. You do smoke up?


Hey, I'm Frank. New York.

Tom, California.
Nice to meet you, Rabbi.

Oh, actually I'm a priest.

You can understand my confusion.

Yeah, a lot of people make that mistake.

Brain cancer. The surgery left me
with a terrible scar.

I wear this yarmulke to cover it up.

They didn't get it all, you know?

The cancer.

Said it'll probably come back.

Who knows about these kinds of things?
Only God.

Anyway, they say that miracles happen
out here on the Camino de Santiago.

Do you believe in miracles, Father?

I'm a priest. It's kind of my job.

You a Catholic?
I don't practise any more.

You know, Mass at Christmas, Easter.
That's about it.

Here. Take this.

No, I can't take your rosary, Father.
No, please, take it.

A lot of lapsed Catholics out here
on the Camino, kid.

Besides... (chuckles)

Thank you.

(bell ringing)

(welcoming in Spanish)

(chattering indistinctly)


(all cheering)

(toasting indistinctly)

(all toasting)

(church bell tolling)

Fore!

Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
I'm sorry! Sorry!

I didn't mean to do that!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

I thought I was out here all alone.

You thought wrong.
Oh, yes.

Hello! I'm Jack from Ireland.

I'm Jack from Ireland.

How long you been out here,
Jack from Ireland?

On the Camino
or in this particular spot?

You pick.
On the Camino, well, jeez...

It's hard to say. This spot, well...

It's hard to say that, too.

But I think this place means something.

"This place means something"?

This place is brimming
with significance!

That's the problem
with this whole damn road.

Problem?
Metaphor, man!

You're out walking all alone and
suddenly in the middle of nowhere

you see a dogfight near a cheese farm.
What does that dogfight mean?

And despite its literalness,

the idea of a pilgrim's journey
on this road is a metaphor bonanza!

Friends, the road itself
is amongst our oldest tropes.

The high road and the low.
The long and winding.

The lonesome. The royal.
The open road and the private.

You have the road to hell.
The tobacco road.

The crooked, the straight
and the narrow.

There's the road stretching
into infinity,

bordered with lacy mists,
favored by sentimental poets.

There's the more dignified road
of Mr. Frost.

And for Yanks, every four years,
there is the road to the White House.

There is the right road.

Then you have the road
which most concerns me today.

The wrong road.

Which I fear I must surely have taken.

Well, Jack, maybe a dogfight
near a cheese farm

is simply a dogfight near a cheese farm.

Ah!

Okay!

That's good. That is very good.

a cheese farm...

Maybe there's no such thing
as metaphors.

Maybe I should adopt
a more conservative attitude

instead of trying to trickle meaning
out of every curve in the road.

Christ, I haven't had
an original thought in months.

Writer's block.

You know what that is? Any of you?

Writer's block?

And I...

I'm a writer.
Okay, so...

The reason I'm out here
walking the Camino. Writer's block.

I figure the sooner we get the
small talk out of the way, the better.

Now you know why I'm on pilgrimage.

Great.

(mobile ringing)

Hmm...

(automated voice) Mailbox full.

Ah!
You have 35 unheard messages.

All from my editors,
who probably think I'm drinking again.

Which isn't a bad idea.

Well, they'll get their book.

Maybe not when they want it,
but they'll get it, by God!

Ooh! Can I bum one of those, please?

Oh. Uh, yes, sure. Sure.

Thank you.

So, uh,

what's your book about, Jack?

The Camino, of course.
Of course.

What about all of you?
What about all of us what?

Why you're doing the Camino.

Most of the pilgrims I've polled
say their walk to Santiago

is for religious, cultural
or historical reasons.

You're taking a poll?
Aye, informally,

though I have been keeping track of most
of the pilgrims I've met along the way.

So far,

less than 15 percent said
they were doing it for health.

Fewer than five percent said they were
out here looking for a miracle.

Miracles are in short supply
these days, Jack.

Well,

if you don't mind,
I'd like to include you in my poll.

I do mind.

Very much so.

Oh, uh...

Would it be all right if I

walk with you for a bit?

Well, I don't know about them.

Oh, okay.

But it's okay. It's cool with me, man.

Really?
Yeah, sure.

I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam.

Joost? Right. Hey.

I mean, I'm not here for God or miracles
or any of that stuff.

I'm just a fat Dutchman
trying to lose a few pounds.

So you're doing it for health reasons?

more or less say that. Yeah.

Yeah, well, would it be all right

if I put you under the category
"doing it for health" for my poll?

Yeah, man, sure. Whatever. Yeah.
Really?

Joost.

Dutch.

Health.

Ah. Thanks.

Would you like to try some of this?
It's Turkish.

I hear it's good for writer's block.

You may be right, Joost.

Yeah, man.

Tom! Hey, Tom!

Everything all right?

Yeah, sure.



Walking the Camino to quit smoking.

That's all I know about her.

She's sexy

but complicated.

He seems like quite a stiff.

I met him in Saint-Jean.

He's an ophth... Um...

An eye doctor from California.

An ophthalmologist.

He didn't come here on pilgrimage.

Seems like it was more like an accident.

I started my pilgrimage in Paris, Joost.

Three months ago.

And if I know one certainty about
the Way of St James,

it is that no one walks this Camino
by accident. No one.

He carries the cremated remains
of his son.

He got caught in a bad storm
over the Pyrenees, first day out.

Oh, you're kidding me.
No.

He carries that box in his backpack.

He leaves little piles of ash
all along the Camino.

That's brilliant!
I mean, tragic, of course.

But brilliant.

Um...

Do you think he'd want
to talk to me about it?

I think he'd sooner shove
that walking stick down your throat.

You're sick.
What?

The reason you're out here.

You're ill and dying.
Not even close.

That's good.

But I will get it.

No, you probably won't.

Next town is Torres Del RÃ­o.
