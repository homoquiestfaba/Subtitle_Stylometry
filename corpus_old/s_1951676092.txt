<i>Oh, do we have a party
going on here or what?</i>

<i>People,
this is how we do this,
this is how we do it!</i>

<i>Now it's time for the moment
we've all been waiting for.</i>

<i>For homecoming king,
the winner by a landslide,</i>

<i>our star quarterback
and All-American candidate,
Brad Warner.</i>

<i>Crown, please.</i>

<i>Looking good, looking good.</i>

<i>And now, by a unanimous vote,</i>

<i>homecoming queen,
valedictorian,
senior class president</i>

<i>and captain of
the Pirate cheerleaders,
Britney Allen!</i>

<i>She's so hot!</i>

<i>Congratulations.</i>

<i>Britney, do you have anything
you'd like to say?</i>

<i>Yes, I would. Go Pirates!</i>

Five, six, seven, eight...

<i>Go, go, go
Go ye mighty Pirates!</i>

<i>Fight, fight, fight
Fight ye mighty Pirates!</i>

<i>Win, win, win
Win ye mighty Pirates!</i>

<i>Go! Fight! Win!</i>

I'd like to see her naked.

<i>Roll call</i>

<i>I'm Winnie</i>

<i>Brianna</i>

<i>Sierra</i>

<i>Amber</i>

<i>And everyone knows
that I'm Britney!</i>

<i>Britney thinks that
she's so hot 'cause she got
the captain's spot</i>

<i>Hey, I won that
fair and square I lost
ten pounds and dyed my hair</i>

<i>We really made a big mistake
Don't you think
her boobs look fake?</i>

<i>I swear
that this is my real chest</i>

<i>My right is bigger
than my left</i>

That's true.

<i>We don't know
just why we chose her</i>

<i>Look at her,
she's such a poser</i>

<i>I'll prove to you
that I'm legit
I'll work hard and never quit</i>

<i>Not, not, not
Not gonna happen!</i>

<i>You, you, you suck
at being captain!</i>

<i>Brit, Brit, Brit,
your cheering is for shit</i>

<i>Not you, Brit
They're not your real tits</i>

You suck, Britney!

Go, Pirates!

Yeah!

Gross.

<i>Britney Allen just farted.</i>

<i>Britney.</i>

<i>Britney.</i>

Britney Allen.

I did not fart!

Thank you for sharing.

Gloss check.

Soy cheese!

Oh, my God.
I have circles under my eyes.

I look so old.
I could pass for 23.

You got plenty of sleep
in class.

Well, that's because
I was up all night
working on new cheers.

You've managed to maintain
a C average
and work on new cheers?

You're such
an over-achiever.

Yeah, Britney,
we already win everything.

Amber, it's not enough to win.
I want to go down
in cheer history.

You already did.
You made captain, and nobody
can take that from you.

Not even me.
Majority rules, remember?

Oh, not the vote thing again.

You don't honestly
expect me to apologize

for winning captain
over you, do you?

Of course not.

Besides,
it's not the first time
that Winnie's lost to you.

Or the second, or third,
or fourth...
Oh, we get it.

Then get over it, Winnie.
I'm so over it.

Can we not do this now?

You're right.
It's old news.

And as your BFF...

Oh, if we're speaking in IM,
you're more like a BFH.
Bitch from hell.

MYOB.
BMA.

WTF, guys?

Thanks.

Half caf, no whip, no foam.
Thanks guys.
Thank you.

Hey, baby.
Hey.

Can I have some?
Sure.

No, no, no.
I didn't mean the coffee.

Stop it,
you're embarrassing me.
What? What?

Then I shouldn't do this,
should I?

Brad is so hot.

Again,
he's Britney's boyfriend.
Get over it, Winnie.

I'm so not over it, Amber.

Brad, stop it.
People are staring.

What? Sweetie, sweetie,
you sound like...
You sound like such a virgin.

I am a virgin.

I'm a quarterback, babe,
people expect me to score.

Well, I want my first time
to be special.
I am special.

Well, I mean,
we have to be special.

I don't want to be
like those other girls.

What, those other...
Like what?
Audrey, Shannon, Lisa...

Yes. Those other girls.

Look, babe, you're nothing
like those girls.

Well, prove it.

If you can show me
your commitment

by the homecoming dance,
then maybe.

Yes! No, no. What? Two months?

That two months is too long.
That's two months too long.

No, come on,
don't make me
wait that long, Brit.

Brad,
you've been waiting for me
since ninth grade.

Two months won't kill you.

All right, fine.

But at homecoming, it's on.

Oh, it is so on.

Go, Pirates!

Cradle.

Good job, guys.
Let's do that one more time.

Oh, come on, Brit.
I could do that routine
in my sleep.

Sometimes I walk
in my sleep. I wonder
if I can cheer in my sleep.

Wow! It worked.

Let's take a break.

Got you, buddy.

If ever there was
an argument for bulimia,
it's Brianna's ass.

Give her a break.

You're the only one
who wants a butt
like an Olsen twin.

Amber alert. Pacific Vista
has never had
a fat cheerleader.

Well, Brianna's
the best on the squad.

So she gained a little weight
over the summer.

She doesn't look that bad.

Are you kidding me?
The girl's a cow.
You have to talk to her.

Britney, you don't have to
say anything. It's your squad.

Brit, if you don't say
something to her, I will.

Okay, fine,
but after practice.

Why wait? Hey, Brianna.

Britney has something
she wants to tell you.

No, Winnie,
not in front of everyone.

Yeah, Winnie,
that's so rude.

Hi.
Hi.

Hey, what's up?

Your weight, Brianna.

No it's not. I weigh
just a couple pounds
more than last year.

And that was pushing it.

I didn't realize.

Well, look,
just lay off the snacks and

with the extra workouts,
the weight
should come right off.

What if it doesn't?

Put it this way.
Pacific Vista's
never had a fat cheerleader.

Wow, Brit.

Why didn't you
just rip out her belly ring?

That would've been
less painful.

Don't worry. That's exactly
how I would have handled it.

Yeah, totally.

<i>There it was,
another number one hit
from Rihanna.</i>

<i>Now, attention
all high school cheerleaders,</i>

<i>Rihanna is hosting an audition
for her TV special.</i>

<i>So, if you think
you have what it takes,
pay attention.</i>

<i>You can download
the contest rules right now
on Cingular Source. Com.</i>

<i>Now, with more hits,
brace yourself,
here they come, KXKB SoCal...</i>

Hi, Mommy.
Hey.

Guess what?
We're going to be
on television.

What?
Yes.

Oh, hi, Daddy.
Oh, hey, princess.

What're you doing home?

How was school?
School was school.

And how was practice?

Great as usual.
The squad
loves my new routine.

And plus,
we're auditioning
for a TV show.

Oh, Britney, honey,
that sounds fantastic.

Did you hear that, Tim?
Yes, Pam.

TV.
I heard.

This is going to be
a little more difficult
than I thought.

What's wrong?

Britney,
your father lost his job.

And we're gonna have to
take a pay cut.

The company's relocating
to Crenshaw Heights.

Oh, Daddy, you'll have
such a long commute.

No, I won't, Britney.
We are moving
to Crenshaw Heights.

I'm really
going to miss you guys.

I said, we are all moving

to Crenshaw Heights.

Are you insane?
I just made captain!

Honey, it's still
early in the year. You'll just
transfer to another school.

Honey, you're smart,
you're pretty, you're blonde.

You'll make plenty of friends.
It'll be fine.

Yeah, fine for you guys.
You're old. Your life is over.

I am a senior,
my boyfriend's a quarterback

and I'm a cheerleader,
damn it!

If you leave,
who's gonna help me remember
my locker combination?

Oh, Sierra,
it's your birthday.

My birthday is April.

Sweetie, your combination
is the digits
of your birthday.

Oh!

What are digits?

We're really
going to miss you, Britney.
IMYA.

I miss you already, too.

Oh, guys. I'm gonna MYSM.

D-A-M-N.

Sierra,
you're not speaking IM.
You're just spelling.

Oh, well then, S-H-I-T.

Come here, I love you.

You know, Crenshaw Heights
is only an hour away.
We can still be friends.

Yeah, but we can't
enter the audition
without a captain.

Actually, we have a captain.
Me.

Get over yourself, Winnie.

No, she's right.

Spirit law states
that if the head cheerleader
has to step down,

the next cheerleader with
the highest amount of votes
is captain.

Thank you. And I promise
I'll use everything
you taught me.

Wait, wait. Babe,
you're not going to be
a cheerleader anymore?

I can't.
I have put my heart and soul
into this squad.

Cheering with anyone else
would just make me...

A cheer whore.

Exactly.

My cheer days are over.

You have to swear.

Swear to us
that you're never
going to cheer again.

Brit,
you don't have to do this.

I swear.

Let's make it official.

"Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

"Now you're not
a cheerleader...
I can't do this.

"...that must really suck."

Brit.

This is a sad, cheerless day.

I know.
Those poor dead pom-poms.

Put them back.
No!

Leave her alone.
She's screwing up everything.

No!
This is stupid.

Please let me keep my pom-poms
and I swear,

as God is my witness,
I will never do another
toe-touch again!

She lost.
She's definitely lost.

Damn.
For real.

OMG.

Yo, Camille.
You gotta check out this CD
I just burned.

Some of this shit
ain't even out yet.
That's hot.

We gonna
set it off this year.
Okay.

Hey, y'all should see
the krump moves
I've been working on for us.

Jesse, it's cute
you trying to be

into choreography and stuff,
but I got this.

You just stick
to finding us the beats,
all right, boo?

All right, cool. But one day,
you'll come begging
for what I got.

Shoot, I'm begging now.
Hook a sister up.

Kirresha.
What?

You are too hot to beg.

I know, but he just so fine,
I'm willing
to make an exception.

<i>Don't tease me, mami.
Me gustan las chicas grandes.</i>

<i>I don't know what you said,
but me gustan, too, baby.</i>

He said he likes big girls.

Now, why come when you say it,
it don't sound cute at all?

Look, he's the one
who said it, all right?

Don't hate
'cause he on me.

Tyson!
Damn, Camille.

Look, you put it out there,
and I'm just
showing my appreciation.

You stupid.
Grow up.

Love you, too.
So immature.

What's up?
Hey.

Looks like
we finally about to get
some snow on campus.

Look y'all. Mall baby
must've got separated
from her mother.

What's she doing here?

<i>I don't know.
This ain't the OC.</i>

Maybe she's lost.

Hey!

Yo, Pop-Tart,
you got any black in you?

No.

You want some?

Oh, no, you didn't!
Come on, man.

OMG.
Look what you did.

Well, it's not like it's real.

For real?
Say what?

And how would you know?

Because this one is real.

Oh, that's nice.
Can I touch that?

My mama bought me this purse.

Oh, your mama.
For sure. Yeah, yeah.

Well, your mother must shop
at the swap meets

because that knock-off sucks.

Oh, I know you didn't
just talk about my mama.

Kirresha, hold my shit.
Take it.
Oh, wait a second. Hold on...

Camille.
What?

Don't do this.
You're gonna get suspended.
So?

You think I'm gonna let this
little Barbie-looking heifer

come up here
and talk about my mama?

Heifer?

Did you just call me fat?
And I did not just talk
about your mama.

FYI, you did.

You speak IM? NFW!

Oh, no.
This girl didn't called you
the N word.

Oh!
Take them.

I would never.

Some of my best friends
live next door
to black people.

Oh, hell, no.
Camille, come on.
We gonna be late to class.

Yeah, she right, girl.
We better go. I ain't trying
to get detention.

Count your blessings,
white girl,
'cause you just got lucky.

Cut you.

I feel scared, maybe
a little nauseous, but
I definitely don't feel lucky.

Oh, hold on, now.

What is this, LAX?

I have my ears pierced.

Hello, Sherlock.
Another piercing.

They're my keys, you perv.

Would you give the girl
her bags?
Thank you.

Hey, what's wrong with you?

Come on, man.

Is this English?
Are you Mrs. Webster?

It is, I am, and you're late.

Well, I was going through
airport security.

Class, meet Britney Allen.
She's a transfer
from Pacific Vista High.

Hi, Britney.
Hi.

<i>She's one of those PV bitches.
Mendiga gringa.</i>

Well, Miss Allen,
have a seat
and copy the board.

You want me to copy
all of that?

Can't you just give it to me
in, like, a book?

Unfortunately, we don't have
enough books for everybody,

and I'd hate to single you out
by giving you one of your own.

We wouldn't want
the other students to think

that you are more important
than they are, now would we?

No.

Good guess.

I know!

You can e-mail it to me.

You think
if we don't have books,
we would have computers?

I'm glad
you have a sense of humor.
Now find a seat.

<i>Good morning,
Crenshaw Heights...</i>

Excuse me.

<i>... just a few announcements
today.
Excuse me.</i>

<i>Coach Carter extends
the Warriors' invitation
to our...</i>

Excuse me.
Excuse me?

What the hell?
Get your ass out of my face.

<i>Mrs. Webster,
Parole Officer Don
needs a deposition</i>

<i>from you regarding
yesterday's lockdown.</i>

<i>Please come
to the administration office
as soon as possible.</i>

Class, I'll be right back.

<i>Thank you, and learn today.</i>

"Can't you just, like,
give it to me in a book

and then my servants
can learn it for me?

"And then I could spend,
like, all day
brushing my hair."

Do you have
any organic greens?

Yummy.

Hey, yo.
Check this out.

We got
some new shit for y'all.

Here we go now!

<i>Roll call!</i>

<i>Roll call!</i>

<i>My name is Leti
Yeah</i>

<i>I like to party
Yeah</i>

<i>And when I shake it
Yeah</i>

<i>The boys say, "Ai, mami"</i>

<i>Roll call!</i>

<i>My name, Camille
Yeah</i>

<i>Give you three wishes
Yeah</i>

<i>To see me shake it
Yeah</i>

<i>'Cause I'm delicious</i>

<i>Roll call!</i>

<i>My name, Kirresha
Yeah</i>

<i>Get out my face
Yeah</i>

<i>And when I shake it
Yeah</i>

<i>It's like an earthquake</i>

Don't forget, everybody,
pep rally after school, right?

Enjoy the show, white girl?

I didn't know
you were a cheerleader.

I'm the cheerleader.
I'm captain.

So? I was captain
at my old school.

And now you go to my school.

So, I guess that makes you...

nothing.

<i>Hey, Britney. Hey, Britney.</i>

We can't wait to see you
at the homecoming dance.

Send us a message.
Hey, how's your new school?

Don't join a gang.
At least, not the first day.

<i>Bye!
Bye!</i>

Hey, guys.
Britney sent a video.

Tears of joy.
She's so happy.

Oh, shit. My bad, shorty.

Don't touch me.

So, you just gonna lay there?

I don't see how my day
could get any worse.

Tough first day?

I've been there.

Are you new, too?

No, I transferred
my sophomore year.
But, man, was that hard.

When did it get easier?

Last Thursday.

Great.

I was joking.

What's your name?

Britney.
Jesse.

I guess I should get up now.

Unless you want footprints
on your forehead.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Weren't you headed...

That way. Yeah.

Yeah!

<i>Cheerleading tryouts tomorrow
after school in the north gym.</i>

<i>Now, your Warriors JV team!</i>

Damn, you must really be
into me to be following me
around all day.

I didn't know
you were a cheerleader.

It's not usually
the first thing I tell a girl.
Why not?

'Cause the cute ones
don't really go
for queerleaders.

I'm a cheerleader, too.

Well, I was.
I know.

How?
'Cause your biceps
are as hard as a rock.

You got a little bit
of a turn-out, but
too many muscles for a dancer,

so it's gymnast
or cheerleader.

You've been watching me.

You got a nice ass, too.
You coming to tryouts?

No. I can never cheer again.

Why not?
Because I swore that I...

It's complicated.
Don't even waste your time,
Jesse.

She can't hang.

Camille,
you don't even know her.
Oh, I know her.

Miss fancy-fingernails-
shimmy-shimmy lip-gloss-
Barbie.

She don't got what it takes
to be a Warrior.

Look, my old squad
would have made yours
look like newbies.

Prove it.
Yeah, show us what you got.

Or what she don't got.

And if I make the squad?
Not likely.

Not interested.

Keep fronting, white girl.
You ain't fooling nobody.

So,

all of y'all think
y'all good enough
to be cheerleaders.

That's funny.

Well, unless you can
do this...

Come on, Leti!

Don't waste our time.

And if you can't do this...

Get them, Kirresha.

Then why
are you still here?

And don't you think
you're gonna be able to get by

without being able to do this.

Come on, boys.

Let's go, Jesse.

Bye-bye.

Or this...

That's right. That's right.

Oh,
now you see what it takes
to really be a Warrior.

This is more like it.
Now, pay attention, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

Now you can start.

All right,
this is how it's going down.

I'm gonna do a routine
and I'll do it
a couple of times.

But if you can't keep up,
you're cut.

Now, if anybody survives,
then we'll decide if you're
good enough to be a Warrior.

Y'all got that?

All right, follow me.

Five, six, seven, eight.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six... Watch those feet.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One and two and three
and four, five, six,
seven... Let's try it.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven... Let's go.

One and two and three
and four, five, six...

You can't keep up, white girl?

One, two, three, four,
five, six... Last time.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One and two
and three and four,
One, two, three, four,

five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.

One, two, three, four.

That's the best you got?

Damn,
vanilla latte got skills.

Yeah, you've gotta put her
on our squad.
She was not that good.

Girl, don't even trip,
you know she was on point.

Why are you
fronting like that? You know
she's was the business.

All right, you what?
Y'all need to chill.

Hey, Barbie.

It's Britney.
Whoever.

You get to call yourself
a cheerleader again.

IDTS.

No thanks.

You know,
there are a hundred girls
who would kill for this spot?

Good. Then you don't need me.

See you.

Girl, we need her.

We got to fill that spot,
Camille.

I said, no. So did she.

Reality check,
Camille. She's the only one
with enough cheer experience.

Powderpuff is as good
as any of us.
Word.

Y'all, she's rude. Conceited.

And she think she all that.

Name one cheerleader
who doesn't.

Do it for the squad.

What the hell?
She's already acting
like a Warrior.

Look, we both know
you don't have any place
to fit in here

except for the squad.

What, are you
cheer pimping now?

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm not a cheer whore.

You're not a cheerleader,
either.

If you were,
you'd have to cheer.

'Cause I hear PV
is a cheer-or-die
type of squad.

Huh, and your squad
couldn't touch us.

Us?

You don't cheer for them
anymore.

The way I see it,
you got two choices here.

Either be at our practice,

or bitch from the bleachers
by yourself.

<i>Rihanna TV special</i>

<i>brought to you by
Teen People magazine,</i>

<i>so you cheerleaders
get those routines...</i>

Hey, how'd it go?

Did you join the squad?

They hate me.
Oh, they don't hate you.

And I promised my friends
that I would
never cheer again.

Well, what kind of friends
would ask you to quit
something that you love?

You don't understand.

Britney, honey, we can never
give up cheering,
not completely.

I cheer for your daddy
every night.

Okay,
you didn't need to hear that.
But I also cheer for you.

I even cheer
for myself sometimes.

Spirit is what makes life fun
even when it isn't.

And there's only
one question here.

Do you love cheerleading?

Yes.

Yes. Well, then,
do what's right for you.

And your real friends
will just be happy
that you're happy.

Now come
and help Mommy unpack.

But our routines
are choreographed
for ten girls, not nine.

And we gonna make it eight
if you don't stop whining.

<i>Don't be getting mad at me
because that chica blanca
turned you down.</i>

Hey, Frosted Flake
in the house.

Hey, Buffy. Ready to be
my baby's mama?

Tyson.

Do it again,
and I'm plucking grapes.

Or in your case, raisins.
Got it?

Yeah.
Okay.

Okay.

Damn, Tyson, that's what
your nasty ass gets.

Hi, I'm Kirresha.

Hi, I'm...
Oh, girl,
I know who you are.

You was killing at the tryouts
the other day.

When I saw you, I was like,

"Damn. That girl
know how to cheer
her butt off."

What little butt you do have.

We need to fatten you up
just a little bit, baby.

Have you ever had
fried Twinkies?
Fried Twinkies?

So, what made you
change your mind?

Oh, I figured
if I was cheering, this place
might suck a little less.

I love your school spirit.
Everybody, this is Britney.

What?

Oh, nothing.
I'm just surprised
you know my name.

I was expecting you to
introduce me as White Girl.

Oh? Well, my bad.

Everybody,
this white girl's name
is Britney.

You happy?

Ecstatic.

Good. Now we can get started.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

<i>Say check it out
Say what?</i>

<i>Warriors is our name</i>

<i>And cheering is our game</i>

<i>We've got winning on our mind
And...</i>

<i>We're mighty fine</i>

Yeah.
See, that was good.

I can't hear y'all. Again.

<i>Warriors is our name</i>

<i>And cheering is our game</i>

<i>We've got winning on our mind
And...</i>

<i>We're mighty fine</i>

<i>Say what?</i>

<i>We're mighty fine</i>

<i>Crenshaw Heights!</i>

Britney Cheers, what was that?

Spirit fingers.

Everybody does spirit fingers.

I've got a spirit finger
for you.

Oh, so you're the only one
who can contribute ideas?

That's right.

This is not a cheer-ocracy.
And there's room
for one captain only.

You understand that?

Whatever.

All right, we need
to work on these stunts
for this audition.

What audition?
The Rihanna TV special.

We need them computers.

You can visit my website,
Cheerwhore. Com.

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Go on, go on.

One, two, three, four.

Okay. Do it again.

Winnie, can I stop now?

Are you still thinking
about food?

Yes.

Then, no.

Keep running
until you're not hungry.

Why are we practicing
out here? Britney always
had us work out in the gym.

There was a reason for that.

Look, Britney's gone now,
so I'm making some changes.

Starting with the audition.
Britney's routine
will make her immoral.

It's "immortal," Sierra.

It's irrelevant, Amber.
I'm captain now,
so get over it.

I am so
not over it, Winnie.

Watch and learn.

What the...
What are you doing?

Somebody get that girl
a pole.
Yeah, for real.

<i>S-L-U-T</i>

<i>What does that spell? Winnie!</i>

No, it doesn't.

You know, as captain,
I could kick your ass
off this squad.

And as a black belt,
I could just kick your ass.

Yes, that was...
You guys should...

Wow. Yeah, Winnie.
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

Yep.

I actually need
a study partner for
the algebra breast on Friday.

Can you help me out?

Yeah. I'd be happy to.

All right.
I'll swing by later then.

What's up, Amber?

You tell me, Brad.

And this is why
we practice in the gym!

Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

What are you doing?
You're not doing it right.

And one, two, three...

Girls, what are you doing?
Camille's not here yet?

No. She left me in charge.

We're supposed to be
practicing the new routine.

What are the boys doing?

I don't know. Goofing around.
They never listen to me.
Come on.

Hey, I said we're
supposed to be practicing.
I'll be right back.

Nobody listens to me.
Am I speaking English here?

Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Stop it, guys! Violence
never solves anything.

Chill, we're krumping.
What?

Look and learn, Pixie Stick.

There we go, Tyson!

Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

Yeah. Give it, Jess.

Yeah.

How do you guys move so fast?

I could probably show you
better than I could tell you.

Oh, no, no, no.
I wouldn't know what to do.

It's like street theater.
Improv the anger in you.

I don't have any anger in me.

You're a rich, white girl,
stuck here in
Crenshaw Heights. Please.

You should be
the angriest person in here.

Stop it.
Get mad. Get mad.

Yeah, what?

All right. Yeah, come on.

Yeah, there's that anger.

That's it, that's it,
that's it. Come on. Here.

There you go, there you go.

Come on, get mad. Get mad.
Now, you're tripping.

You better
get your girl, man.

For real. All right, D. Go.

Give it, Jess. Yeah.

All right. That's right,
that's right.

Okay, white girl.

Oh, no!
Quarrel!

Damn.
Guess he brought it to you.

That's right.
That's right.

That boy is fit.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah, he's popping his gasket.

You're all right.

Will you guys
quit playing around? We're
supposed to be practicing.

I'm still in charge here,
damn it.

Hey, Leti, if we added
some of this krumping,

it could really get us noticed
by Rihanna.

No. If we change
Camille's choreography,
she'll be pissed.

Yo, Leti. Camille ain't even
here. If you're in charge,
act like it.

Don't tell me what to do.
Come on. Try something new.

Yeah, girl.
We can always change it back.

Yeah, don't be scared.
I'm not scared.

Leti, this could help us win.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Come on. Get it.

It's good, yeah.
That was great.

That was so good.
Pretty hot.

That was great.

Whose idea was this?

Well,
I came up with the steps.

But we all contributed.

Yeah. It was a group effort.

I had nothing to do with it.

So, do you like it?

Hell, no.

Camille, don't blame them.
It was my idea
to change the routine.

Why?

Because half of the moves
in your routine are illegal.

What are you? A cheer cop?

You can't do that.

No, girl,
you can't do that.

Judges take off points
for vulgarity.
I know the rules.

Then why do you keep
breaking them?

Because the things we do
get us noticed.

Even when we don't win,
they say we're the best.

Wouldn't you rather they say
you were winners?

I mean, come on, Camille,

if we play by the books
and add this krumping,
we can't lose.

Is this the type of shit
your old squad pulled on you?

Changing cheers
behind your back?

No.

And if there was one girl
who thought
she could run your squad

better than you could,
what would you
have done to her?

There was.

I should've told her to stop.

And see, that's the difference
between me and you,
white girl.

I'm not telling you.

Now let's practice this
the way it's supposed to be.

See? Y'all should've
listened to me.

Hey, you.
You're late.

Sorry.
I had to study, sweetie.

That's okay. I got some DVDs,
and I thought
we'd just stay in.

Oh, that's the pizza.
Can you get that
while I get the soda?

Yeah.

Hey, large pepperoni,
pineapple?

Yeah, how much?
$14.65.

Dude, you get any action
on this job?

What are you talking about?

You know,
you ever get some ass?

Like in those porn movies.

Deliver a pizza
to some desperate housewife.
Tap that?

That never happens
in real life.

You should try
being the quarterback.

We get ass up the ass.

I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

Yeah,
I know what you mean.
All right.

Here, you know what?
Keep the change, dude.

Dude, thanks.

That's the least I can do.
Your job sucks. Loser.

Dick.

Asshole.

What happened to you?

I spilled a little.

What were you and Jess...
Guys talking about?

What, the...

Pizza.
What, with the pizza guy?

Yeah.
Oh.

Nothing. No,
I was just giving him
a hard time, that's all.

I heard what you said, Brad.

Britney, I was just
screwing with him, okay?
It was a joke.

Well, it didn't sound
like a joke.

Well, it was, okay?
Now, you better turn
that frown upside down

'cause that's
gonna put wrinkles
in your pretty little head.

And it's gonna look perfect
for when we take pictures
at the homecoming dance.

<i>So, you do realize
you're only one of many squads
auditioning for Rihanna?</i>

<i>Yeah, we know
there's a lot of competition,
but we're ready for them.</i>

Amber, I can't come to school
today, so you can lead
practice. But videotape it.

No excuses, just do it.

<i>Is there anything
that makes your squad
stand out from the others?</i>

<i>Yeah. We better.</i>

<i>And we really, really want
this. Not just for ourselves,
but for our schools.</i>

<i>Well, good luck,
Crenshaw Heights.</i>

Crenshaw Heights?

<i>Hey, turn... Oh, my God!
I'm on TV! I'm on TV!</i>
