<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

<i>But what of the man?</i>

<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

<i>...and I know in 1605, he attempted</i>
<i>to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

<i>But who was he really?</i>

<i>What was he like?</i>

<i>We are told to remember the idea</i>
<i>and not the man.</i>

<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

<i>He can be caught</i>,
<i>he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

<i>But 400 years later...</i>

<i>...an idea can still change the world.</i>

<i>I have witnessed firsthand</i>
<i>the power of ideas.</i>

<i>I've seen people kill</i>
<i>in the name of them...</i>

<i>...and die defending them.</i>

<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

<i>...cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

<i>Ideas do not bleed.</i>
<i>They do not feel pain.</i>

<i>They do not love.</i>

<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

<i>It is a man.</i>

<i>A man that made me remember</i>
<i>the 5th of November.</i>

<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

<i>So I read that the former United States</i>
<i>is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

<i>...that they have allegedly sent several</i>
<i>containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

<i>Well, you're listening to my show</i>,
<i>so I will assume you do.</i>

<i>It's high time we let the colonies know</i>
<i>what we really think of them.</i>

<i>I think it's payback time for a little tea party</i>
<i>they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight</i>
<i>and dump that crap...</i>

<i>...where everything from</i>
<i>the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!</i>

<i>Did you like that?</i>

<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.</i>
<i>I mean, what else can you say?</i>

<i>Here was a country that had everything</i>,
<i>absolutely everything...</i>

<i>...and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

<i>Godlessness.</i>

<i>Let me say that again.</i>

<i>Godlessness.</i>

<i>It wasn't the war they started.</i>
<i>It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

<i>It was Judgment.</i>

<i>No one escapes their past.</i>
<i>No one escapes Judgment.</i>

<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

<i>You think he's not watching over</i>
<i>this country?</i>

<i>How else can you explain it?</i>
<i>He tested us, but we came through.</i>

<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

<i>Islington. Enfield.</i>
<i>I was there. I saw it all.</i>

<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

<i>...homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.</i>
<i>They had to go.</i>

<i>Strength through unity.</i>
<i>Unity through faith.</i>

<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman</i>,
<i>and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

Oh, shit.

<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

<i>This is for your protection.</i>

<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

<i>This is for your protection.</i>

Excuse me.
Sorry, I didn't see you...

In a hurry, are we?
I was just...

It's past curfew, you know.
My uncle, he's very sick.

Sick uncle? What you think on that, Willy?
It's a load of bollocks.

I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

Don't touch me!
Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

She just threatened us.
That she did, that she did.

You know what that means,
don't you?

It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

And you get to swallow it.

You're Fingermen.
She's getting the picture.

No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

Not yet you're not. But you will be.

By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

What do you think, lads?
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

Help me! Someone help!

The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

What the hell?!
Bugger off!

Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

...which smoked with bloody execution.

We're Fingermen, pal.

Jesus Christ! Mercy!

We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

That with devotion's visage and pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

What's that mean?
Spare the rod.

I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

Who are you?
Who?

Who is but the form
following the function of what...

...and what I am is a man in a mask.

Oh, I can see that.
Of course you can.

I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

Right.
But on this most auspicious of nights...

...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

Voil√†!

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

...cast vicariously as both victim and villain
by the vicissitudes of fate.

This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

...and you may call me V.

Are you, like, a crazy person?

I am quite sure they will say so.

But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

I'm Evey.
Evey?

E-vey. Of course you are.

What does that mean?
It means that I, like God...

...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

Are you hurt?

No, I'm fine.

Thanks to you.
Oh, I merely played my part.

But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
I suppose.

You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

What kind of musician?

Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

...and would be honored
if you could join me.

I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

All right.

It's beautiful up here.

A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

I don't see any instruments.

Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

November the 4th?
Not anymore.

<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

First, the overture.

Yes.

Yes, the strings.

Listen carefully, can you hear it?

Now the brass.

I can hear it!

Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

How do you do that?
Wait.

Here comes the crescendo!

How beautiful, is it not?

<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.</i>
<i>You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

The Bailey area is quarantined.

All significant witnesses
have been detained.

<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture</i>.

<i>Add it to the blacklist.</i>
<i>I never want to hear that again.</i>

Yes, sir.

We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

...indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

<i>Mr. Dascomb</i>,
<i>what are we doing about that?</i>

We're calling it an emergency demolition.

We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

Several experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

<i>I want Prothero to speak on</i>
<i>the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

<i>...and how we must avoid clinging</i>
<i>to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey</i>
<i>will become the symbol of our time...</i>

<i>...and the future</i>
<i>that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

We also managed to get a picture of the girl
that Creedy's men were detaining.

<i>Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
Not sure yet, sir.

But we're working on several leads.
<i>Anything else?</i>

We located the fireworks launch...

...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

Unfortunately it appears that
despite the heavy level of sophistication...

...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

...making them very difficult to trace.

Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

<i>Spare us your professional annotations</i>,
<i>Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

Apologies, chancellor.

<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

<i>Moments such as these</i>
<i>are matters of faith.</i>

<i>To fail is to invite doubt</i>
<i>into everything we believe...</i>

<i>...everything we have fought for.</i>

<i>Doubt will plunge this country back</i>
<i>into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

<i>Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...</i>

<i>...and I want him to understand</i>
<i>what terror really means.</i>

<i>England prevails.</i>

England prevails.

You think people will buy this?
Why not?

This is the BTN.

Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

That's the government's job.

On the lighter side of things...

...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the old Bailey...

...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

<i>Although the demolition had been</i>
<i>planned for some time...</i>

<i>...the music and the fireworks were</i>,
<i>according to the crew chief...</i>

<i>..."definitely not on the schedule."</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

I saw it, the whole thing.

Did you see it?
No. Last night I was...

Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

Evey, there you are.

You are still working for me.
Sorry, Patricia.

I need two espressos and three coffees.

And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

I don't get it.

Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

Maybe he's just getting started.

Yeah?

Okay. A lead on the girl.

Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

Mr. Deitrich...
Gordon, please.

I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

Gordon...

...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

...and I got scared and went home.

Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

Gotcha.

Hey, Fred.
All that been x-rayed?

Nope. They're filled with bombs.

Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

I can't believe you watch that shit.
What?

Laser Lass is banging.

What's all that?

Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

Must be Prothero.

I wish someone had the balls to tell
that brat this station ain't his playground.

What the hell is this?

Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

They were detained when she was 12.
What happened to her?

Juvenile Reclamation Project...

...for five years.
Shit.

We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

You sure about that, sir?

I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

Who's that?

Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

Fucking hell.

Come on, let's move!

You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

<i>Will all personnel please</i>
<i>evacuate the building.</i>

<i>This is not a drill.</i>

<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

What the hell's going on?

It's jammed.
Break it down.

Dominic!

Police! Out of the way!

Get out the way!

Damn it!

<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>

<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>England prevails.</i>

Clear the halls.
Sir.

<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

Don't touch it.

Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

<i>Good evening, London.</i>

<i>Allow me first to apologize...</i>
That's the emergency channel!

<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate</i>
<i>the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

<i>...the security of the familiar</i>,
<i>the tranquility of repetition.</i>

Bloody hell.

<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.</i>
<i>But in the spirit of commemoration</i>...

Who's that, Mum?

<i>whereby important events of the past...</i>

<i>...usually associated with someone's death</i>
<i>or the end of some awful, bloody struggle...</i>

<i>...are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

<i>...I thought we could mark</i>
<i>this November the 5th...</i>

<i>...a day that is, sadly</i>,
<i>no longer remembered...</i>

<i>...by taking some time out of our daily lives</i>
<i>to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

<i>There are, of course</i>,
<i>those who do not want us to speak.</i>

Let me think, let me think.

<i>Even now, orders are being shouted</i>
<i>into telephones...</i>

<i>...and men with guns</i>
<i>will soon be on their way.</i>

It's Chancellor Sutler.
Damn it!

<i>Why? Because while the truncheon</i>
<i>may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

<i>...words will always retain their power.</i>

<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

<i>...and, for those who will listen</i>,
<i>the enunciation of truth.</i>

<i>And the truth is...</i>

<i>...there is something terribly wrong</i>
<i>with this country, isn't there?</i>

You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

<i>Cruelty and injustice</i>,
<i>intolerance and oppression.</i>

<i>And where once</i>
<i>you had the freedom to object...</i>

<i>...to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

<i>...you now have censors and surveillance</i>
<i>coercing your conformity...</i>

...<i>and soliciting submission</i>.
Cameras. We need cameras.

<i>How did this happen? Who's to blame?</i>

<i>Certainly there are those</i>
<i>who are more responsible than others.</i>

<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

<i>But again, truth be told</i>,
<i>if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

<i>...you need only look into a mirror.</i>

<i>I know why you did it.</i>

<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

<i>There were a myriad of problems</i>
<i>which conspired...</i>

<i>...to corrupt your reason</i>
<i>and rob you of your common sense.</i>

<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

<i>And in your panic, you turned to</i>
<i>the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

<i>He promised you order</i>,
<i>he promised you peace...</i>

<i>...and all he demanded in return</i>
<i>was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

Inspector, they're almost through.
<i>Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

<i>Last night</i>,
<i>I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

<i>...to remind this country</i>
<i>of what it has forgotten.</i>

<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen</i>
<i>wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

<i>...forever in our memory.</i>

<i>His hope was to remind the world</i>
<i>that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

<i>...are more than words.</i>

<i>They are perspectives.</i>

<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

<i>...if the crimes of this government</i>
<i>remain unknown to you...</i>

<i>...then I would suggest that you allow</i>
<i>the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

<i>...if you feel as I feel</i>,
<i>and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

<i>...then I ask you to stand beside me</i>,
<i>one year from tonight...</i>

<i>...outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

<i>And together, we shall give them</i>
<i>a 5th of November...</i>

<i>...that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

Cover the exits.

No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

Left.

You go right.

Spread out.

Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

Hold your fire!

He put masks on all of us.

Jesus.

Don't shoot!
Wait!

Wait!
Hold your fire!

Freeze! Nobody move!

If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

Get their masks off.
Please hurry!

There's a bomb in the control booth.

Oh, no.

Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
Yes, sir.

Marshal, help carry this man.
Sir.

Everyone else, let's go.

Good God.

Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

Dascomb.

Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

Do you have any idea what you're doing?

Wait, wait!

Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

On your knees! On your knees!

Please! Please don't hurt me!

Here we go.

I did it.

I did it.

Freeze!

Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

I don't know about that.

<i>We're interrupting your regularly scheduled</i>
<i>program to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

<i>...of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower</i>
<i>which ended only moments ago.</i>

<i>A psychotic terrorist</i>,
<i>identified only as the letter v...</i>

<i>...attacked the control booth with</i>
<i>high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

<i>...that he used against unarmed civilians</i>
<i>in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

<i>We've just received this footage</i>
<i>of a daring police raid.</i>

<i>Stop! Stop, stay where you are</i>,
<i>or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!</i>

<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

<i>...but at this time, it's believed</i>
<i>that during this heroic raid...</i>

<i>...the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

Bollocks.

<i>Again, from what we've been told</i>
<i>by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

Right there. What's he thinking?

Is he considering leaving her?

After she just saved him?

He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

Some part of him's human.

And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

You scared me.
My apologies.

Are you feeling all right?
Yes, thank you.

What is this place?
It's my home.

I call it the Shadow Gallery.
It's beautiful.

Where did you get all this stuff?
Oh, here and there.

Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of objectionable Materials.

You stole them?
Heavens, no.

Stealing implies ownership.

You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

God, if they ever find this place...

I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

You mean, after what you've done.

God, what have I done?

I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

You did what you thought was right.
No, I shouldn't have done that.

I must have been out of my mind.

Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

I think I should go.

May I ask where?
Home. I have to go home.

They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

I have friends, I could stay with them.
I'm afraid that won't work either.

You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

...but I couldn't see any other way.

You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

...in the pursuit of finding me.

After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

Here, to my home.

I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

But I don't even know where this is.

You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

That'd be enough for a clever man.
Are you saying that I have to stay here?

Only until I'm done.
After the 5th, I no longer think it'll matter.

You mean a year from now?

I have to stay here for a year?

Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

You should've left me alone.

Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

Anything else on the parents?
Yeah, it ain't good.

They were interned at Belmarsh.

Oh, no.
Yeah.

She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

Christ.
It's nothing but bad luck here.

So we know her story. Now we need his.

V?

I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

Your hands.

Yes.

There, that's better.

I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

Can I ask what happened?

There was a fire. A long time ago.

Ancient history, for some.

Not really very good table conversation.

Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
Have a seat.

It's delicious.
Good.

God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

Where did you get it?

A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
Yes.

You're insane.

I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

<i>Macbeth.</i>
Very good.

My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

Be in plays, movies.

When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Mum was very proud.

Where is your mother now?

She's dead.

I'm sorry.

Can I ask about what you said on the telly?
Yes.

Did you mean it?
Every word.

You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

There's no certainty, only opportunity.

You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

People should not be afraid
of their governments.

Governments should be afraid
of their people.

And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

Symbols are given power by people.

Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

...blowing up a building
can change the world.

I wish I believed that was possible.

But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I know this is not a man.</i>

What is he?
<i>A man does not wear a mask.</i>

What is he?
<i>A man does not threaten innocent civilians.</i>

<i>He's what every gutless</i>,
<i>freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

There will be no negotiation.

When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

Find another DoP
or find yourself another job.

<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

<i>I wish I'd had the chance</i>
<i>for a face-to-face.</i>

<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

<i>This so-called v and his accomplice</i>,
<i>Evey Hammond...</i>

<i>...neo-demagogues</i>,
<i>spouting their message of hate.</i>

<i>A delusional and aberrant voice</i>
<i>delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

<i>An ultimatum that was met</i>
<i>with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

No mercy!
<i>The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

Good guys win, bad guys lose...

...and, as always, England prevails!

Holy Christ! Jesus!

Good evening, Commander Prothero.

Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

You wore a uniform in those days.

You.

It is you.
The Ghost of Christmas Past.

Yeah?
<i>Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

Dascomb.
<i>I've already called the chancellor.</i>

<i>We have to get control of the situation.</i>
What situation?

Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

...could be devastating to our credibility.

Perhaps a stroke?

No, no, it's too horrific.

A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

We got any eyes or ears on this?
No, camcos were cut.

It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

Let me guess.
She's in deep, inspector.

V?

My fat, metal friend.

Mondego.

Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

My favorite film:

<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

<i>It is not my sword, Mondego</i>,
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

It gets me every time.

Never seen it.
Really?

Would you like to?
Does it have a happy ending?

As only celluloid can deliver.

Okay.

Put the sword away.

Forensics just wrapped.

No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

Drugs?
Could've started his own hospital.

Interesting.
Why?

Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

...before he was
the Voice of London?

Drugs?
Legal ones.

Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

<i>May we come up?</i>

<i>You find your own tree.</i>
You find your own tree.

Did you like it?
Yeah.

But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
Why?

Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

<i>nationwide were devastated</i>
<i>as news of the most popular</i>...

Wait. What's this?

<i>most awarded stars</i>
<i>in the history of the BTN...</i>

<i>...a man known to the entire nation</i>
<i>as "The voice of London"...</i>

<i>...passed away late last night</i>
<i>from apparent heart failure.</i>

She's lying.
How do you know?

She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

<i>It came as no surprise</i>
<i>to those who knew him...</i>

<i>...that his body was at his office...</i>

<i>...where he often worked long hours</i>
<i>after everyone else had gone home.</i>

<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

You didn't take it, did you?

Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

Did you have anything to do with that?

Yes, I killed him.
You...

oh, God.
You're upset.

I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

What?
Violence can be used for good.

What are you talking about?
Justice.

Oh, I see.

There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

And are you going to kill more people?

Yes.

Take a look at this.

Prothero's military record.

What do you see?

Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

Busy boy.
But after all that...

...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

You're welcome to review our records.
We've been through your records.

All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

Well, there you have it.

This is a matter of some urgency, major.

We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

Usual undesirables, I should think.
But do you know?

Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
Do you know who was?

I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

As head of the Detention Program
at that...

Before you go any further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

We all did what we had to do.

And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

That's all I have to say about that.

You can do this.

Hi.

I've been thinking...

There's something I want to ask you...

...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

A man after my own heart.

He always told the best stories.

Until my brother died.

That was when everything changed.

<i>My brother was one of the students</i>
<i>at St. Mary's.</i>

<i>After he died</i>,
<i>my parents became political.</i>

<i>They protested the war</i>
<i>and the Reclamation.</i>

<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor</i>,
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

<i>I watched on the television...</i>

<i>...thinking I was going</i>
<i>to see my parents killed.</i>

<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.</i>
<i>Dad refused.</i>

<i>He said if we ran away, they would win.</i>

<i>Win, like...</i>

<i>...it was a game.</i>

Evey, quick, hide!

Mummy!
Evey!

<i>I never saw them again.</i>

It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

I'm sorry, Evey.

No, I'm the one that's sorry.

Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

...but I'm not.

I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

...but I am.

I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

...please let me know.

If you wish.

Do you really think
you'll find something here?

Worth a shot.

One thing is true of all governments:

The most reliable records
are tax records.

It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

Thanks. This is a great help.

"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

Personal motto?
From <i>Faust.</i>

That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

It is. And speaking of the devil...

...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

Of course.
It appears unforeseen circumstances...

...have accelerated my original plan.

As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

I'll do my best.

I believe you will.

Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

I don't know, but this is interesting.

The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

Really?
Yeah, Father Lilliman.

Lilliman.
Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

Now, that is interesting.

Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

Your Grace.
Oh, Denis.

Has everything been arranged?
Yes.

I've just received your InterLink itinerary.

You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

You're most diligent, Denis...

...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

Your Grace?
It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

My last little joy.

I'm sorry, Your Grace.

She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

Older?

Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

That is for Your Grace to decide.

Oh, my.
Your Grace.

To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

Mea culpa, my child.

Mea culpa.

Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

A confession?
I love the confessional game.

Tell me your sins.

This isn't a game, Your Grace.

Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

I'm sorry?
I'm telling you this...

...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

I think this should balance it out.
What are you talking about?

I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

Wonderful!

It's a game I've never played!

What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you is just as interesting.

No, please, you have to believe me.
Oh, I do, I do, I do.

Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

Stop it! Get off of me!

Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

Now, how best to procure
her confession?

You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

Reverend.
Oh, my God.

She wasn't lying. It is you.

I'm sorry.

I had to.
Evey!

And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

Oh, please, have mercy.

Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

<i>Not tonight.</i>

<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

<i>Open your mouth</i>
<i>and stick out your tongue.</i>

What the...?
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

Tonight.
Yes, sir.

Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

Creedy.

What are you doing here?

Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

The security of information
is paramount.

In these volatile times...

...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

What does that mean?
Terrorist seems to have...

...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

At this time, it would behoove you...

...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

You mean Larkhill?

Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

His loyalty is not in question.
But mine is?

Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

I've been a party member for 27 years.

If I were you, chief inspector...

...I'd find the terrorist...

...and I'd find him soon.

Please.

Evey? Good God!

I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

Cheers.
I know every cop's looking for me.

I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

Evey...
You could be in terrible trouble.

Evey, listen to me.

If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

You trusted me.

It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen</i>.

My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
He believes he did.

Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

...it always cheers me up.

What is that?
It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

Are you a Muslim?
No, I'm in television.

But why would you keep it?

I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

Thank you, Gordon.

Thank you so much.
It's all right.

This whole thing started the night
he blew up the old Bailey.

I was on my way here, and...

Yes.

You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

But...
You're wondering why...

...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a television show.

I'm sorry.
Not as sorry as I am.

The truth is, after so many years...

...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

Thanks, Delia.

Any leads on finding this guy?

Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

You started as a botanist, didn't you?

It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

They're believed to be extinct.

He leaves them at the crime scenes.

I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

Any information could be helpful.

Of course.

Excuse me.

Yeah?

<i>I just finished going through the file</i>,
<i>inspector. You better get back here.</i>

Yeah, okay.

My God. He's killed them all.
All but one.

Who is she?
Not sure.

She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

Running away?

Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

She changed her name.
That's what I'm guessing.

I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

It's late, or early.
Call them again. I want that name.

What? Are you sure about that?

Okay. Thank you.

Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

The coroner?
Yeah.

Jesus, I just saw her.

It's you, isn't it?

You've come to kill me.
Yes.

Thank God.

<i>I'm sorry, I can't get a response</i>
<i>from that number.</i>

<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

Jesus Christ.

He's there.

After what happened,
after what they did...

...I thought about killing myself.

But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

I didn't know what
they were going to do.

I swear to you.

Read my journal.

What they did was only possible
because of you.

Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

He changed the entire course
of human history.

Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

I've come for what you did.

It's funny.

I was given one of your roses today.

I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

There are no coincidences, Delia.

Only the illusion of coincidence.

I have another rose.

And this one is for you.

You're going to kill me now?
I killed you 10 minutes ago...

...while you slept.

Is there any pain?
No.

Thank you.

Is it meaningless to apologize?

Never.

I'm so sorry.

Damn it.

The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

<i>Am I to understand that you have read</i>
<i>this document, inspector?</i>

Yes, sir.
<i>Has anyone else read it?</i>

No, sir.
<i>Then let me make this perfectly clear to you.</i>

<i>The contents of this document</i>
<i>are a matter of national security...</i>

<i>...constituting an assault on the character</i>
<i>of several important party members...</i>

<i>...as well as a blatant violation</i>
<i>of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

<i>As the authenticity of this document</i>
<i>cannot be verified...</i>

<i>...it could be an elaborate forgery</i>
<i>created by the terrorist...</i>

<i>...as easily as it could be the deranged</i>
<i>fantasy of a former party member...</i>

<i>...who resigned</i>
<i>for psychological reasons.</i>

<i>Any discussion of this document</i>
<i>or its contents...</i>

<i>...will be regarded, at the very least</i>,
<i>as an act of sedition...</i>

<i>...if not a willful act of treason.</i>

<i>Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
Yes, sir.

<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

<i>...to put it out of your mind.</i>

<i>May 23rd.</i>

<i>My first batch of subjects arrived today...</i>

<i>...and I have to admit</i>
<i>that I'm very excited.</i>

<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

<i>...in a world where a virus</i>
<i>can kill an entire population...</i>

<i>...and leave its wealth intact.</i>

Stay together!
Come on, move!

<i>May 27th.</i>

<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab</i>
<i>with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

<i>...who I was told is here to monitor</i>
<i>for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

<i>It made me nervous, but the commander</i>
<i>assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

<i>June 2nd.</i>

<i>I keep wondering if these people knew</i>
<i>how they might be helping their country...</i>

<i>...if they would act any differently.</i>

<i>They're so weak and pathetic.</i>
<i>They never look you in the eye.</i>

<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

<i>August the 18th.</i>

<i>Of the original four dozen</i>,
<i>over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

<i>September the 18th.</i>

<i>There is one case that continues</i>
<i>to give me hope.</i>

<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system</i>
<i>pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his</i>
<i>blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

<i>The mutations seem to have triggered...</i>

<i>...the abnormal development</i>
<i>of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

<i>The subject said</i>
<i>he could no longer remember...</i>

<i>...who he was or where he was from.</i>

<i>Whoever he was</i>,
<i>he is now the key to our dream...</i>

<i>...and the hope that all of this</i>
<i>will not have been in vain.</i>

<i>November the 5th.</i>

<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

<i>The first explosions tore open</i>
<i>the entire medical section.</i>

<i>All my work, gone.</i>

<i>I was trying to understand how</i>
<i>it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

<i>The man from room 5.</i>

<i>He looked at me.</i>

<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

<i>But I know he was looking at me</i>
<i>because I felt it.</i>

<i>Oh, God...</i>

<i>...what have I done?</i>

What is that you're making?

We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

This is weird.
What?

The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

Really?
I swear.

That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

There is?
Yes, Evey.

I am V.

At last you know the truth.

You're stunned, I know.

Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

That is not funny, Gordon.

Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

There is something wrong
with this country.

Morning, inspector.

You're at it early.

Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

I don't care if you answer me or not.

I just wanna say this aloud.

But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

Because of the terrorist?

No.

So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

...and Three Waters.

The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

...the question I have to ask, is:

What if the worst...

...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

...was not the work
of religious extremists?

Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

And they were executed. I know.

And maybe that's really what happened.

But I see this chain of events...

...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

What if someone else
killed all those people?

Would you really wanna know
who it was?

Sure.

Even if it was someone
working for this government?

That's my question.

If our own government was responsible...

...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

...if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

...would you really wanna know?

<i>This has to be the bloody coldest</i>
<i>March in years.</i>

<i>Keep talking like that</i>,
<i>we'll lose our party status.</i>

<i>They're a pack of lying, greedy hypocrites!</i>
<i>Keep it down, will you?</i>

Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

<i>Mr. Creedy?</i>
We're handling it as best we can.

Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

What's all this about?
I'm celebrating.

Celebrating what?

I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

<i>Very good evening</i>,
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary</i>
<i>show for you tonight.</i>

<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

<i>Will you please give</i>
<i>a very warm welcome...</i>

<i>...to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

No way!
No, it can't be!

We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

Oh, my God.

<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

<i>...I understand you've been under</i>
<i>tremendous strain lately...</i>

<i>...since the beginning</i>
<i>of this whole terrorism business...</i>

<i>...and we thought it would be a nice idea</i>
<i>to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

<i>Warm milk. There's nothing better.</i>

<i>I understand you enjoy a glass</i>
<i>every night, chancellor.</i>

<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>
