Free Baader!

We are watching! We are watching!

Free Meinhof!

Patricia.

So, I have a patient
that is coming in five minutes.

I can ask him
to come back later.

Please.

This song, it's stuck
in my head, and it's so loud.

Do you see what I mean?

Do you see what I mean?

They're going to try
to keep her alive after all.

Markos?

Quick, get us seats over there

before those boys take them!

The guitarist is so cute...

I was right.

They are witches.

I have to tell Sara
to get out of there.

She's the only girl
I actually give a damn about.

Her delusion has deepened into panic.

She feels her constructed mythology
is confirmed.

If I leave without her,

they may pick her next.

Or Olga.

I should warn Olga, too.

Olga's already
figured out things.

She saw how they groomed me.

There's more in that building
than what you can see.

They've been underground
since the war.

And you think
they can hear you now?

At the beginning,
they gave me things.

Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

Talking with our minds.

But they took my hair.

They took my urine. They...

They took my eyes.

Now she can see me.

Mother Markos.

She wants to get inside of me.

I can feel her.

I thought I wanted it.

I let it happen.

Do you understand me?

If they find out I was here,
they won't hesitate.

They will hollow me out
and eat my cunt on a plate.

Herr Berger is waiting for you,
Doctor.

Mr. Berger, please.
Good morning, Doctor...

Okay, that's good. That's good.

Morning, Pastor.

Did the rain get your clothes
all wet?

No, don't you worry. The girls
just hung that all up.

Is what I just heard
on the radio.

That'll just about do it.
Just about.

How is she today?

You are Mrs. Bannion.

Hello.

You're Miss Tanner?

Yes. Come in.

Nah?

I tried to call you
at your hotel this morning

to ask you
if you could reschedule.

Why?
Company business.

It's not a good time just today.

But here you are.

And one, and two,

and three, and four,

and five,

and six, and seven,

and eight.

Elbows up. And one...

Come in, Susie.

Miss Millius and Miss Mandel
are the company's repetiteurs.

And Veva Blanc?

I was told she would be here.

Oh, dear.

You have no formal training
or references.

Your insistence to audition

happened to catch Madame Blanc
on a good day.

But you really shouldn't
be here at all.

Do you understand?

Yeah?

Good.

Well, then let's start.

I prefer dancing without music.

Thank you.

You can keep time
in your head, yes?

And Hypnose.

And here we have...

a line between the elbows.

Face forward.

Perfect, and... Morphus.

And here,
not so close to the face.

More like you're holding
a bird or something.

They did it when we
were in morning rehearsal.

They just put her things
in shipping boxes.

You don't think she
had to go underground, do you?

I don't care what happened.

I just want her to call.

I'm really worried.

Miss Bannion, come.

I've just spoken
with Madame Blanc.

Well done, Miss Bannion.

I imagine you will need
to return home

to settle things
and make arrangements

for moving to Berlin.

No. No, no.

I can start right now.

Good.

This is Miss Boutaher,

our technical director.

Hello.

And this is Miss Vendegast.

She acts as house mother...
Hello.

...for our dancers
who reside here.

Where'd you come from?

Ohio.

We operate as a sort
of Ruth BrÃ© collective.

As we cannot pay our dancers
a lot of money,

we offer dormitory-style rooms,
rent-free.

You don't... you don't charge
anything at all?

Not a mark.

In this company,
we fully understand

the importance of a woman's
financial autonomy.

Normally, it would be full
at this time of year,

but we have had a room open.

Yeah. Patricia's.

Do you know Patricia?

No, I heard some girls talking

about her in the hall.

Now that you're one of us,
I won't be coy.

Patricia has just left
the company

under sad circumstances.

We think she won't be back,
so there's room if you want.

We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.

After lunch.

It's all right for you?

Yes.

It's-it... it's all...

Yes.

It's perfect.

Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.

Hi.
It's the rain.

Whenever it rains in Berlin,
everyone jumps in a cab,

and like an idiot,
I just let ours go.

Hi. I'm Sara.

We're gonna have to take
our chances on the street.

Do you have an umbrella?

When you weren't here
by 6:00,

I had to take the room
for another night.

Oh. God, Susie, I'm sorry.

Everything was a mess
at the company today.

Why are you smiling?

I'm sor... I-I...

When you said Berlin
a second ago,

you said "everyone in Berlin,"

and I just thought that...
that includes me now.

I live in Berlin.

Yes. Congrats.

I heard you were
a sensation today.

Have you called your
family yet, to tell them?

Miss Blanc came
into my audition.

But she left right after.

She's incredible.

The way she transmits her work,
her energy.

When it shines on you, it's...

"addictive" is the word for it.

She's tough.

She kept the company alive
through the war.

When the Reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds

and keep their uteruses open,

there was Blanc.

Thank you.

"La vrai chose."

What?

W-Was that French?

It's a bomb.

I can smell it.

There's a bank that way.

Don't you know
what's happening here?

The hijackers
are negotiating a release

of the Stammheim prisoners
tonight.

The RAF.

Baader-Meinhof.

They kidnapped an executive.

During the war,
he was a Nazi SS, an officer.

Now he runs the German
Employers' Association.

You don't get how awful
that is, do you?

Sorry.

I'm just worried
about my friend.

Now for the voting,

each of us says the name
of her choice.

Mandel, whom are you voting for?

Markos.

Killen?
Blanc.

Judith?
Markos.

Boutaher?
Blanc.

Millius?
Markos.

Martincin?
Markos.

Huller?
Markos.

Mauceri?
Blanc.

Marks?
Markos.

Pavla?
Markos.

Kaplitt?
Blanc.

Vendegast?
Blanc.

Balfour?
Blanc.

Creusot?
Blanc.

Alberta?
Markos.

Thank you.

Griffith?

Griffith?

We're at the end.

Mother Markos.

I abstain.

I vote for Markos.

Markos wins by three.

It is decided.

Mother Markos will remain in control.

Let no one's vote be held against her.

And let the will
of the majority proceed.

Long life to Markos.

Long life to Markos!

...there is no information yet

on whether the
hijackers will pilot

the Lufthansa flight
to a fourth destination

or what is the condition of
the 91 hostages still presumed aboard.

Yesterday, one of the Palestinian
hijackers issued official demands

including the release of all
Red Army Faction members

incarcerated at Stammheim prison...

Stop dreaming, sweetheart.

Mother asked for you.

She has to know that we can move ahead

now that last night's
business is behind us.

You all knew my concerns
about Patricia.

What happened to Patricia was ghastly.

But now that we voted
Mother wants to try again.

And soon.

The question isn't just
who to try next.

We have to make sure
the ritual will work

with whichever girl we choose.

Mother trusts you already have
ideas on this subject.

Maybe Sara could be a good option.

Yes. It was right to send her
to collect the American girl.

Sara is a good ambassador
for the company.

She's made a home here, hasn't she.

She feels good here.

Loved.

Uncle Josef.

Good morning my dear!

Are you going to your country house?

Yes.

I'm freezing my ass off.

I'll go to the university later
on, with Clara.

Who is speaking?

Lacan.
Lacan!

Good morning Doctor Klemperer!
Good morning.

Are you going to your country house?

Next stop Friedrichstrasse.

This train terminates here.

Please have your identification ready
to enter East Berlin.

Anke, look...

everything is full of leaves again!

I swept them away just last Tuesday.

Bedrooms are on
the second floor.

Why don't you try speaking
to me like you love me?

For a change.

This is my room.

And here...

is yours.

We're neighbors.

You can knock on the wall
if you ever need anything.

Miss Sesame?

Doctor, I got the semolina
from Frau Meier.

They are demonstrating again for
the release of the R.A.F. terrorists.

Before the war Germany
had the strongest women...

like your wife Anke.

Wasn't she strong Doctor?

First rehearsal
in the Iris Studio today,

in twenty minutes.

You're to lead
your own stretches today.

Good morning.

Good morning.
Hello.

Good morning.
Good morning.

Hi.
Good morning. Good morning.

How's your knee? Okay?

It's wonderful you're here.

Thank you.

We have some happier
company business today.

We have a new dancer.

This is Susie Bannion,
who's joining us from America.

I was privileged to witness
her audition yesterday.

We are very lucky to have her.

Would you like
to say something, Susie?

I don't know.

Hello.

I feel like
I'm not even here yet.

I don't know.

You join in
whenever you feel ready,

but there's no rush.

Welcome to our little family.

I'm Susie.

Hi. Hi.

All right,
so for today's rehearsal,

I want to pick up exactly
where we left off with Volk.

I've spoken to Olga,

and she's going to dance
Patricia's part.

And, Sara, I'd like you
to dance Olga's part.

Is everyone happy with that?

Okay.

Good.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Music off, please.

One moment.

Okay, so...

And one, and two, and three.

You pull it from the ground.

All right? Gravity, remember.

And everybody from here, please.

And Tanner.

One and two and three.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two and three...

This is shit.

Such shit.
Okay.

Why don't we all break
for ten minutes.

You can't even be bothered
to respect your own lies.

Miss Ivanova!

No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

Let's face this.

Patricia is gone, Olga.

We don't know where.

If she's gone into hiding,
she wouldn't have told us,

would she?
She would have told someone.

We know that she had dealings

with people
who are interested in targets.

And we know
there was another bomb

in Kreuzberg last night.

She wouldn't do that.

She wanted to live her beliefs.

Who doesn't admire that?

And there's so much to change
in the world.

If she wants to live in a cellar

filling bottles with petrol,
that's her choice.

And who won't be heartbroken
if she's shot by police?

You manipulate everything.

She didn't trust you
because you're hypocrites.

Will you take Olga
to her room, please, Tanner?

No, Miss Tanner!

Call Olga a cab.

She's had enough.

And is going to pack her things

and get the fuck out
from this box of rabies!

I'm sorry about that.

It's a hot thing we do.

Okay, so... who will dance
the protagonist?

Sonia?

I can't. Not yet.

Caroline?

Very well. We'll manage.

I suggest that we all
take it from the top.

I'll dance.

I know it.

It's in the documentary.

I-I've seen it a hundred times
at the library.

Sweetheart,
we rehearsed this piece

for ten months
before we performed it.

I've seen it in person, too.

First do it alone, then.

We don't want to put
the others at risk.

The last thing we need

is someone to get kicked
in the ribs.

All right?

Miss Marks, music please!

Okay, stop. Stop, stop.

Stop.

All right.

Clear your head.

I want you to start over.

Have you stretched?

This is no joke.

Olga.

Are you alright?

Olga.

Come over here.

Come.

Come to me.

Over here.

Remember, you start
on one with the music,

and if you feel ill
at any time, just stop.

You start here.

And...

Lauter!

Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

It'll pass.

You're not the first dancer
who lost the room.

I'm not usually dizzy.

An occasional collapse

is a vocational hazard,
I'm afraid.

I-I didn't...
I didn't collapse.

You're on the floor, and that's
not where the dance ends.

I was trying not to throw up
in your studio.

Susie, it's fine.

It was wonderful.

Sara, can you take her
to her room, please?

You can rest
for the rest of the day.

How enlightening.
Okay, come on, girls.

Let's go.

And one, and two, and three.

And...

No, Susie.

We have to study America.

I said no.

Susanna.

Everything fine?

Attention, please.

Don't hurt Olga...

Slowly...

Out!

Police station, good evening.

Good evening. I'm reporting
a young woman who may be missing.

She couldn't have known
what she was doing.

She just carried more
of our intention than we expected.

We also let ourselves
get angry with Olga.

I could feel it.

But the girl is a natural.

Like Patricia. Only clean somehow.

She may be more
what we're looking for,

even than Sara.

Are we saying that?

No. Not yet.

You don't look better.

Or are you this pale
all the time?

I will leave you.

Good night.

The Amish split

from the Mennonites
in the 17th century.

They were worried the Mennonites

were becoming too liberal.

"They"? Not "we"?

You've left religious thinking
behind you, then?

And you're not comfortable
talking about these things.

I don't know why we are.

It's difficult not
to be curious about you.

In two days, you've auditioned,

been accepted and danced a lead.

How did your journey
towards us begin?

I went to New York.

To the Martha Graham Center.

I saw you there three times.

I went once by bus,

then I hitchhiked the other two.

That's risky.

Were you punished?

Yeah.

But I felt I had to see you.

What did it feel today

to dance Volk in front
of the one who made it?

No, no.
That's a vain question.

Let me ask you another.

When you were dancing,
what did it feel like...

inside you, inside your body?

It felt like what I think
it must feel like to fuck.

You mean to fuck a man?

No, I...

was thinking of an animal.

You looked...

I'm going to ask Caroline
to work on your jumps with you.

Yours are nowhere near
good enough yet.

We'll have to build you up.

So that I can dance
the protagonist

when you perform it?

I'll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again.

I can do it.

Olga made Volk seem
like such heavy lifting.

She never understood
the heart of Volk.

She lacked conviction.

I'm relieved she's gone.

Thank you for your help
with that.

Madame Blanc...

wants me to dance
the protagonist in Volk.

I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.

She's so kind.

That's wonderful.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I was just...

I was just thinking about
what Olga said in rehearsal.

About Patricia.

What do you mean?

She was active
in some political groups.

No one knows where she is,
really.

If she's all right.

Was it true...

what Olga said?

Yes.

Patricia didn't trust
the matrons.

And I never understood why.

If I asked you for a favor
tomorrow, would you do it?

Yes.

We might get caught.

Okay.

Mother. Mother.

Mother.

Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

Mother. Mother.

Susanna.

More.

Harder.

Come inside, hurry up!

What do you want?

We need to talk to someone in charge.

Miss Markos.

About a girl named Patrizia...

Patricia Hingle.

Someone named Blanc then?

I'm she.

Why don't you come in?

Please...

Follow me.

Good morning.
Good morning.

Good morning.

Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

Okay, well, let's meet soon.

Yeah, no, I'm-I'm... I'm ready.

I'm almost out the door.

Okay. Yeah.

I'll see you soon.
Marketa.

Marketa, come on.
I'll see you soon.

Come on.

Come, come, come.

Are you sure no one's coming?

I'm sure. Don't worry.

Nobody comes here
during the weekend.

Patricia's isn't here.

Try looking for Olga's.

Olga...

She's not here.

I just need a number.

For her parents or someone
who can tell me for sure

she is or isn't in Berlin.

How odd.

1961.

1955.

1949.

It's bizarre.

Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

There's nothing.

Come on.

Sit down.

This morning,

we turn our instincts inward.

Miss Millius, Miss Mandel,

can you close the mirrors,
please?

Miss Marks, no music.

I want to start work
on a new piece.

A piece about rebirths.

The inevitable pull
that they exert

and our efforts to escape them.

We'll learn it now, but, Susie,

you will improvise freely
at its heart.

I'm interested
in your instincts here.

The piece will be called
Wieder Ã–ffnen.

Open Again.

"Let's go.".

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One...

...two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One...

You should have told me
she was coming.

She wanted to feel Susie for herself.

So you put her...

in a storage closet?

Under the floor?

Mother wanted it.

I thought we agreed to stop
using that title.

If Markos really were
one of the Three Mothers

we wouldn't be in
this situation.

You should have told Markos about
Miss Bannion yourself.

Now Mother wants her.

Are we going to waste
another girl so quickly?

Everyone voted.

You are not the light
we chose to follow.

If Markos wants this girl,
you must prepare her.

And does she?

Yes!

Markos will live.

We found the girl in time.

I won't rush again.

I will tell Markos
when the girl is ready.

Alright...

Did something happen?

To you, during it?

N-No.

Did you... did you...

Did you feel something there?

Someone?

Or just something.

What made you say that?

I don't know.

Am I confusing you?

No, it's...

It's odd. It's the...

It's the sort of thing
Patricia would say.

It's bizarre.

Come on.

Let's get changed,
or Sonia will leave without us.

I've got a dress you can wear.

Double caposhi.

Susie!

Susie!

I want to bring in a custom
from the old ways.

What do you have in mind?

A witness.

One of our new friends
from the police?

Why not one of those
young things at the window?

You're forgetting we already
have a witness.

The old man who sent us
the Polizei in the first place.

He will be our witness.

Yes. Not one of our girls.

It would make any of them insane.

I agree.

And it's good for Susie
to see us like this.

That we're still part of the world.

Maybe she even senses
what we want of her.

She senses a lot.

You can see her eyes shine with it.

I see it every night.

When I send her our dreams.

Is it true?

Is it true?

I know who I am!

I know who I am!

It's all right.

It's okay.

Is she all right?

It's just a nightmare.

The Markos Company special.

I'm surprised it took this long.

Hey, let me know
if she needs a Valium.

She's right. I dreamt
of hairballs in toilets

for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.

Move over.

I've only ever slept
in bed with my sister.

We're sisters now.

In a statement released
to the press moments ago,

the hijackers' leader Martyrer Mahmud

demands Baader, Ensslin, Moeller
and the other RAF prisoners

be released from Stammheim prison
and flown to Mogadishu.

Good morning.

I'd like to talk to Detective Glockner
or Detective Albrecht.

Your name?

One moment.

...as proof of their intentions

the hijackers threw
down onto the tarmac

the body of the flight's pilot
Jurgen Schumann.

He had been shot in the head.

Agent Glockner's office
is on the right.

Have a seat here,
they'll call for you.

Terror suspect.
Do you know this woman's name?

Doctor Klemperer?

Please, come inside.

We were shown every room.

We didn't see anything
worth remembering.

They are professional performers.

Illusion is their craft.

It's not your place
to speculate on that.

Did you speak to the woman
called Markos?

Patricia referred to her as

Mother Markos.

She had a delusion about this woman

leading a coven there.

She had this delusion for months.

Do you believe in witches, Doctor?

No.

But I believe that...

people can organize themselves
to perpetrate crimes

and call it magic.

That I can believe.

Do you understand the kind of week
we are having, Doctor?

Detective Glockner.

This isn't the first time we've met.

You were on the police force
in Friedenau, weren't you?

You helped me
to try to locate my wife.

Your wife also went missing?

Two years before the Russian charge.

1943.

From the records, you helped me
cross off Poland.

I'm still grateful.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

One, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

That's-that's okay.

Do you want to do the jumps?

Okay.

And...

one, and two, and three.

And one, and two, and three.

No.

Elbows higher.

All right, one moment.

Susie, part of the jump
is muscle,

and that will develop
as you condition,

but you seem to have
an aversion to them,

and I don't quite see why.

Are you so happy
to be stuck to the earth?

There's a yield before the push,

which I don't think
you're quite understanding.

Caroline. Could you come and do
a series for us, please?

Thank you.

And now you.

What I really want
is to be on...

on the floor right now, anyway.

Well, of course.

That's because you're mistaking
physical weakness

with artistic preference.

And because you're tired.

At this point,

the jumps are opposing
the pull of the structure,

but...

it's soon for that,
don't you think?

The floor work is... is keeping
the other dancers pushed down.

So this...

this could echo that...

...on-on a slightly higher
point of elevation.

If I stay close
to the ground now

and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later,

then that's more to the point.

The resistance is more...

emphatic.

Right?

I don't know how aware you are

of what times we lived through
here 40 years ago.

Out of which
this piece was made.

We learned at great cost
through those years

the value of the balance
of things.

Every arrow that flies
feels the pull of the earth,

but we must aim upwards.

We need to get you in the air.

Leave her, leave her,
leave her, leave her, leave...

Caroline don't be afraid.

Everything will be alright.

Yes?

She hit her head hard.

I heard it. I hope...

Miss!

One moment please!

I am... I'm looking for
a dancer from your company.

Who are you looking for?

You are Sara.

Yes.

May I help you?

I am a friend from Patricia.

When the deadline arrived,

the hijackers informed the police

they had poured all the flight's
duty-free alcohol over the hostages

and were set to ignite them.

But when they were told
the West German Government

was in the process of releasing
the Stammheim prisoners,

they agreed to extend the deadline
to after midnight.

I don't know what
to make of any of this.

I know the kind of thing
she was involved with,

but I can't see how any of this

could be happening
inside the company.

Well, she describes...

something like
a revolutionary organization

in a crisis of leadership.

With Markos very ill...

I live there.

I have friends there.

I don't see any evidence
of this at all.

No one has ever approached me

or any of the other girls,
as far as I know.

Read this.

What is this?

This is Patricia's diary.

Mother Markos.

Mother Meinhof.

The dance rehearsal.

Political action.

These two areas
in Patricia's life

were of equal importance.

This is how
transference happens,

how delusion is made.

Delusion, Sara,

is a lie that tells a truth.

This says "witches."

Maybe Patricia's fantasies
about witches,

they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.

The company's a family.

There's a lot of love there.

Love and manipulation...

they... they share houses
very often.

They are frequent bedfellows.

Sorry, I don't see this.

Eat.

Eat.

Only...

maybe the police,
they missed something.

And Patricia,
she did spoke of...

whole hidden areas
of the building.

Actual rooms that are secret.

I don't want
to be disrespectful...

I don't...
but you're asking me,

and I'm telling you...
Please.

It's a dance company.

We're not talking
about anything else.

Sara.

Please, only look closer.

Thank you for caring
for Patricia,

but I hope you don't come again.

Good night.
Good night.

Sara, hurry up.

I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

Good night, Doll.
Good night.

She hasn't come back yet?

Maybe she's seeing somebody.

Part of the issue always

is not being able
to see your body in space.

One angle in one mirror
or on film is not enough.

Movement is never mute.

It is a language.

It's a series
of energetic shapes...

...written in the air

like words forming sentences.

Like poems.

Like prayers.

Spells?

When you jump,
it's not the height

but the space beneath you
that matters.

Every leap into the air
must be a coup de foudre.

I don't understand.

A strike of lightning.

A bolt of love, in fact.

That's beautiful.

There are two things
that dance can never be again:

beautiful and cheerful.

Today, we need to break the nose

of every beautiful thing.

And if you're going
to be a dancer,

you must learn French.

Try not to worry.

Blanc is working on the new approach.

How could we have known
what would happen with Patricia?

What we are attempting
hasn't been done in living memory.

How do we know it will work at all?

If it killed that girl

it may kill any girl we try.

She's not wrong.

Patricia was unwilling in the end.

Blanc believes that was the reason.

We shouldn't have forced it.

She didn't want to be a vessel.

We wanted to bring her into our power

but she wanted to blow up
department stores instead.

What a fool, that girl.

When you dance
the dance of another,

you make yourself
in the image of its creator.

You empty yourself

so that her work can live
within you.

Do you understand?

Yeah.

You're in a company now.

You have to find
your right place.

You have to decide...

what is it you want to be
for this company?

Is it the head?

The spine?

The sex?

The heart?

The hands.

I want to be
this company's hands.

Higher.

Higher. Higher.

Higher.

Higher! Higher.

Higher.

Higher, higher, higher.

Higher.

Higher.

Higher. Higher.

Higher. Higher. Higher.

Sometimes I only need
to be told twice.

How do we know no one's planning
to blow us up, too?

Patricia might have said anything
to anyone about us.

As she did with the old man.

You're right.

We cannot despair.

We have time.

How much time?

If Mother dies
before Blanc can deliver us Susie

this company is finished.

Markos will hold on, for us.

You've seen her.

Her body's a prison!

Disease on top of disease.

How long can she possibly...

33, 34, 35, 36,

37, 38, 39,

40, 41.

57, 58, 59,

60, 61, 62, 63.

65, 64, 63, 62.

23, 22, 21.

Ten, nine, eight,

seven, six.

Two, one.

We couldn't stop her!

She was too fast with the knife!

She's cold!

Come with me! Quickly!

Patricia wrote about

"Three Mothers" lost in time,

predating all Christian
invention.

Pre-God. Pre-Devil.

Mother Tenebrarum,
Mother Lachrymarum

and Mother Suspiriorum.

Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

I saw images of that last night.

In porcelain,
these very fine things.

You can tell they have money.

Patricia said that Markos

claims to be one of the Three.

But there is dissent
amongst them.

She wrote about "Markosites"
and "Blancites."

In-Internal division.

Madame Blanc's involved in this?

Do they believe they're witches?

You can give someone
your delusion, Sara.

That's religion.

That was the Reich.

The Reich had these things.

Insignia.

Esoteric ritual.

These "Mothers," yeah,
they could be

code names for founding members

with metaphoric histories.

I don't know.

But I do know you are living
with dangerous people.

Patricia could still be in...

...in there.

They could be holding her.

In the building.

Well, I cannot promise
that the authorities

will come back to
inspect a cabinet

full of porcelain
after all that has happened.

But we can try.

And in the meantime,
you must take care of yourself.

Perhaps you should leave.

You have somewhere you can go?

I'll figure it out.

And I think you should
put this back.

Or better still,
you leave it here.

Not good for them
to know that you have it.

Judith, let me do it.

Here you are.

Is anyone among you sick?

Let him call for the elders
of the church;

and let them pray over him,

anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord.

And the prayer of faith
shall save him that is sick,

and the Lord shall raise him up;

and if he has committed sins...

My daughter.

...they shall be forgiven him.

My last one.

She's my sin.

She's what I smeared
on the world.

First of all it's very important,
do you remember this?

You must use your center.
Yes.

Your center is here
and you must create a space.

Now I understand.

Wait, wait.

Alright.

Suspended, suspended in the air.

Remember to create a space.

You're making some kind
of deal with them.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

How can you know

what they're going
to ask you in return?

Sara, whatever you have
in your mind,

nothing is wrong.

You just haven't
seen the bill yet.

Nothing's wrong.

Special forces
in the German Federal Police

stormed Lufthansa 181 in the night

and killed three of the four hijackers

ending five days of terror
for the passengers of the flight.

In the morning,
in the high-security wing

of the Stuttgart-Stammheim
prison

three of the five RAF prisoners
were discovered dead

in an apparent suicide pact made upon
hearing of the news from Mogadishu.

Protesters are congregating
around Germany

chanting that the prisoners
were instead assassinated.

Federal Police President Horst Herold,
went so far as to declare

"The Baader-Meinhof era is done."

What's the matter with you?

You don't be so afraid
about the white, Susie.

They need to see you
from the very back row.

Where is Sara?

She came early in the morning,

did her makeup and left.

Good evening, welcome.

Here you are.

First time here, isn't it?

Please, come.

Yes, thank you. Have fun.

Straight ahead.

Girls!

Vier minuten!

Four minutes!

Vier minuten!

Tak, tak.

Is it true?

Sara.

Sara.

Patricia.

Patricia. Patricia.

I knew it.
They'll kill him.

I'm sorry it took me so long.

I'm so sorry.

What did they do to you?

I wake up here every day.

It's all over now.
I'll get you out.

The performance
is starting upstairs.

Everyone will be looking
the other way.

Get up. Get up.

Patricia!

Patricia, get up.
I'm trying.

Get up.

Get it off of me!

Sara!

Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

Good evening.

We created this piece in 1948.

Marketa.

Where is Sara?

Sara?

I don't know.

Is she upstairs?
No. I looked.

Just dance as if she's with you.

Sara!

This is the last time we are performing it.

The Markos Dance Company presents...

...Volk.

Go!

No.

My darling...

No.
Sara, lie still.

No!
Sara.

Please. Please...

No! No!

The girl is ready, Blanc.

It's time.

Please, remain seated!

Stay calm and remain seated.

We will continue the performance soon.

Sorry...

She broke her leg.

Come on.

Attention, please.

We decided otherwise.
Thank you, for your understanding.

Everything will be fine.

Please, leave the room.
We have to cancel the performance.

Everything will be fine.

Everything will be fine.

Everything will be fine, Sara.

Good. That's good.

ARYAN PAPERS

I'm sorry I went off book.

This can't happen again.

You're only just starting
to understand, Susie.

We brought Sara back upstairs

to try to complete
the performance in time,

but then you derailed it.

Did I hurt those people?

Not this time.

They saw a dance.

That's all.

It's all a mess, isn't it?

The one out there.

The one in here.

The one that's coming.

Why is everyone

so ready to think
the worst is over?

I could
explain everything to you.

I think it would be wrong,
though.

You don't want to make me choose.

Because you love me.

Close your eyes.

No more dreams tonight.

I'll make...

I'll make sure of it.

One, two, three, four...

Tonight.

It must happen tonight.

But Doctor, the soup is ready!

You can eat and drink

all that you want!

Thank you.
For you.

Can I bring you something to drink?

Congratulation!

Who's there?

Josef.

Anke?

Karol told them about us.

I had only a few minutes to get out.

I got to the apartment

but my papers weren't anywhere.

Then I traveled by foot

to Teplitz

where I planned to ask Mirek's family
to take me in.

But I was caught at the border

and taken to Terezin Camp.

No one believed me
that I was born in Gartz.

After the Liberation
I made my way to Zurich.

And then to Bristol.

I've made...

...a new life there.

A lovely life.

I was told

you'd died in the invasion.

Look how dirty he made it!

Have pity!

Have pity!

What reason is there to pity you?

You had years to get your wife
out of Berlin

before the arrests began.

When women tell you the truth

you don't pity them.

You tell them they have delusions!

I'm not guilty...

I am innocent!

I remember everything!

I am innocent!

Are there guilty men in Berlin?

Everywhere!

But I am not one of them!

I'm ready, Madame.

You look afraid.

She's afraid for you.

There will be nothing of you

left inside.

Only space for me.

I came here for this.

You've all waited long enough.

It is happening.

It is happening!

Do you come here willingly?

You must have no doubts, Susie.

If you do, I can take you back.

I can take all of this
from your head.

You can forget everything.

I want this to be pure.

We all know what you want.

This isn't vanity.

This isn't...

art!

There is something wrong here.

Can you not feel it?

This is not right.

We have to stop this now.

We have been on

two sides of this

for too long now.

Markos! Markos! Markos!

Markos! Markos!
Markos! Markos!

Markos! Markos! Markos!

Markos! Markos!

Markos! Markos! Markos!

Markos! Markos!

If you accept me,

you must put down
the woman who bore you.

Think of that false mother now.

Reject her.

Expel her.

You have the only mother
you need here.

Death to any other mother.

Say it.

Death to any other mother.

Who are you?

For whom were you anointed?

Which of the Three Mothers?

Mother...

Mother Suspiriorum.

I am she.

Markos.

Markos!

Markos!

Markos.

Death to any other mother.

Markos.

Markos!

Markos!

Markos!

I am the Mother.

What do you ask?

To die.

Mother.

Mother, we're so tired.

What do you ask?

To die.

I want to die.

Sweet girl.

What do you ask?

Die.

Dance. Dance.

Keep dancing.

It's beautiful.

It's beautiful.

It's beautiful.

Watch your step.

Here. Yes.

It's been snowing.

Everything is pretty.

And again, slowly.

Yeah, okay.

Good. This is good.

My God, what a night.

I definitely drank
too much wine.

And what about the song
of Tanner and Balfour?

It was fantastic!

Salam aleikum, Miss Boutaher!
Aleikum salam. Good morning.

Good morning.
Caroline. How is Sonia?

Good morning.

Girls, I need you to listen.

I have such sad news

and I want you to be brave when you hear it.

Madame Blanc has left the company.

Be brave.

How will we go on?

Be brave girls!

Be brave.

ARYAN PAPERS

This is not the way to do it, Doctor.

I nearly called the police myself.

You need to take care of yourself.

You haven't been well, I know!

But it cannot go on like this...

Who are you?
How did you get in here?

Wait outside.

I regret what my daughters
did to you.

I wasn't in a position
to prevent it.

I believe you deserve
to know the truth.

Your wife did try
to make it south

to Teplice.

She was apprehended
by border guards

in the woods
just outside of Glashutte.

She was then taken
to Theresienstadt camp.

She lived there for 20 days.

On the 11th of November, 1943,

the commandant of the camp,
a man named Burger...

...ordered all 40,000
detained there

stand outside in the cold
for a census.

Hours and hours passed.

Some hundreds died of exposure.

Your wife had two women
with her as she died.

Women she had befriended,

who made her feel
that she was not alone.

Her final thoughts...

were of a birthday

when you took her
to a concert as a surprise.

Chopin and Brahms.

It was the first time
you held her hand.

She was cold when she died.

But she wasn't afraid.

She was thinking only of you.

Of Anke Meier...

...of Patricia Hingle...

...of Sara Simms...

...of Susanna Bannion,

of all the women
of your undoing...

...every memory will vanish.

They will melt away in the sun

and be gone.

We need guilt...

...Doctor.

And shame.

But not yours.

Doctor.

Doctor.

Who are you?

Frau Sesame!

Yes?
Yes.

How late is it?
Around 11 o'clock.

Could you call her?
Okay, I will.

Go to your mom.

Come Lutz!

Yes.
Bye.

Hey, it's Alexandra.
What about dinner?

Bye, Alex.
