Let's not have people coming in,
I'd like to do it without anybody in here.

Could everybody... split?
I'd love to begin, thanks.

Maybe we can keep...
And close the door.

Keep away from the door...
All good?

Yep.

"And never have I felt so deeply
at one and the same time"

"so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

Albert Camus.

"For Henry"

I wasn't good in school,

I didn't care for school,

Um... It was nice socially,
in my own experience, but...

I kind of just went along.

I started off as a Music Major,

Gonna be a Rock'n Roll star...

But that didn't quite worked out.

In 1985,

During the hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

I was walk... I was taking a
train, into the city, to work

I was... I'd gotten into work and I was
on the phone with my brother-in-law,

who... had just started teaching.

And he said
that he was off from school.

Now Mike, wait a second,

You off from school for hurricane, and
I... and I'm going to the city to....

To work in an office building?

It's a pretty good gig, right?

My mother was a teacher

And I knew without
a shadow of a doubt,

from my early childhood,

That the one job I would never do
is become a teacher.

Never ever, I would take...
toll cards on a turnpike,

I'll be a shepherd, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

And I decided to be a teacher because
I wanted to do something with my life,

Besides what I was doing,
which was driving a truck,

for a company, and um...

And I decided I wanted to do a
little bit better for myself,

so I went into teaching a little
bit, I went back to school,

And, at age of 37...

A friend of mine from college,

His aunt was the...
principal of an all-girls

inner-city school in
New-York, New Jersey.

And they were desperate for teachers,

So I thought "Great, I
can do this for a year,"

"it will keep my father for making me
get a job at Prudential,"

"and... then I'll figure
out what I want to do."

Well, they called me up and
asked me for an interview

And... I have to make out the job,

In a Junior High school in Queens

And I ended up...

Starting what...
what's now my 30th year.

Most of the teachers here,
at one point,

They believed,

That...
they could make the difference

I know how important it is to...

have guidance, to have...

someone help understand
the complexities

of the world that we live in.
I didn't really

have that... growing up.

I am money,

I change hands like a dollar bill
that's been robbed by a lamp

Men and genie appeared
in a cry of love

with volume

But the tears were all for myself

And that's when it all went wrong

* Phone ringing *

* Beep *

Hi, Lupe, its Dean Vargus here.

I'm sick and I won't be
coming in today, alright?

* Beep *

Get to the point, Dr. Hart,
I've got a school to run.

The state's score's gone
down the last three years,

You're not delivering...

Don't pretend like you
don't know the game,

You earmarked my school for the
worst kids in the district...

These kids deserve an
education, don't you agree?

I agree. You're jerking
off on wasting my time.

Get to the point, Dr. Hart...
We need consensus builders,

a new methodology...

You're corporatizing the system.

No, we're cleaning house.

The superintendent feels
it's time you step down.

Babe, you got some fucking nerve coming
into my yard with a heart fucking sell.

Carol, it was a time when
you were an educator,

You were very well respected.

Why don't you go out on top?

Allright. Everybody sit down and shut
up, or I start pulling out the referrals.

Sit.
Sit down.

I am starting the DVD.

I am starting the DVD.

<i>Barth</i> or <i>Barthes</i>
<i>Barth</i>

Mr. Barth, ma'am.

Mr. Barth, Henry Barth.

So you've taken long
term assignments at...

"Locke" and "McArthur".

The "fringe".

Well, that's where the works are.

This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

I asked to meet with you
because you come highly

recommended as the best
sub on the call sheet.

That's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

I agree, Mr. Barth.

You will find <i>many</i> of your students
functioning well below the grade level.

That's your task to tray
and get them caught up.

Teach the curriculum, most importantly.
Understood?

Good morning.
Good morning.

I'm Mr. Barth,

Those of you who haven't heard,
this is English 11A.

Listen up, I have one rule.

Just one.

If you don't wish to be here,

Don't come.

Dude, what does that mean?

It's not dude, it's Mr. Barth.

The S is silent.

You're fucking gay
Marcus, shut up!

No, you shut up!

You dike bitch!

Hey Marcus, guess what?

What?

You're free to leave.

Like right now?
Like right now.

A'right, yo...
Catch you later, man!

What's the fuck, do you want
me to go to the Dean's Office?

I don't care where you go.

Everyone, pull out a sheet of paper.

I would like to assess where
your individual writing skills are...

What if he got no paper?

Okay, here is the situation:

You're dead.

Alright, write a brief but
detailed essay about...

Hey jackass,...

I asked you a fucking question!

About what a friend or a parent

might say about you
during your funeral.

Okay? You have 30 minutes.
Oh shit...

I asked you a motherfucking
question, didn't I?

Anything else?

You'd better back the fuck up before
I fucking rock your shit.

That bag...
It doesn't have any feelings...

It's empty.

I don't have any feeling
you can hurt either.

Okay?
I understand you're angry.

I used to be very angry too, okay.

I get it. You have no reason to
be angry with me, because...

I am one the few people that's here
trying to give you an opportunity.

Now I'm going to ask
you to just sit down

and do your best.

And I'll give you a piece of paper.

How's that?

Can I get a fucking pen too?

Kids don't have any attention span.

They're bored.

So how are you supposed to reel them in
with classic literature if they don't...

If they don't believe...
that you...

have something meaningful to share?

Thank you.

Why did you threw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

And Marcus verbally assaulted you
and that's not allowed in my classroom.

What they say to me is immaterial.

What's your name?

Meredith.

Nice to meet you, Meredith.

So you really don't care
what the kid say to you?

Perhaps I've gotten used to it.

I wish I could be that strong.

It doesn't take strength, Meredith.

You gotta... understand that unfortunately
most of people lack self-awareness

You should really keep that in mind as you
head into the trenches of second period.

You're gonna meet them again,
at every age.

I want to see the Principle!

That's her, mom.

You're the bitch that expelled my baby?
And for what?

Excuse me, maybe you would like to...
Because you can't handle it?

Bitch why are you here?
You want to be at home where I

am every day?!
I don't have time for this bullshit!

Keep your voice down!
Why are you here?

Hey, Ma'am. Calm down.

We'll go talk about this
in the Dean's Office.

I ain't going nowhere with you

Look, miss, I know you're angry...

but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

Racist bitch, I'm gonna sue your ass...
Okay, come on, ladies...

This way...

Ladies,...
What happened?

Bitch, you give me any
more shit in class and I'm

getting my nigger's fucking
gang rape your ass!

Excuse me.

Are you new here?

Yes, first day.

Welcome.

That was quite a scene back there.

I was a little stunned.

But it's actually safe here.

Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.

Henry, Henry Barthes.

Whatever is on my mind,
I say it as I feel it

I am truthful to myself.

I'm young

And I'm old
at the bottom of that soul

So many times

I am hardfaced, I am gone

I am just like you

Patricia?!

Patricia Patricia

Patricia

Hello?
Henry, it's Rita from the hospital.

He's done it again,
you need to get down here.

Bastards, leave me alone!

Why aren't you handling this?

I can't get him out!

You come and get him...
Patricia?

Thanks.

Grandpa, come on, it's Henry.
Open the door.

Patricia?

No, it's Henry, it's Henry.

Who?
It's Henry.

Grandpa, please, open...
open the door...

Oh, hi, sweetheart.

I thought that you were your mom.

You're dressed okay,

Were you going somewhere?

Well I'm going to work.

You are retired.

You are retired, okay?

It's very very late so I need
you to go to sleep, okay?

Let's go to bed.

How are you doing, huh?

Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

Isn't that silly?

Everything okay?

You shut up!

You listen.

I know you're just under-educated job

Passing the time with
these old dying people.

But I'm paying for
his assisted living

And you're not assisting him!

I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

You know how he gets
at night, he forgets

So you need to be there for him.

To make him feel safe.

Let me be very clear here:

You stop neglecting his needs

Or I will start fucking with yours!

I will have you fired!

That is going to be your family,

Your children, are
gonna be at risk!

You got it?!

Don't you ever make me come down
here again at this hour,

Okay?

Give me the fucking money!

You heard me.
Give me the fucking money!

What?
Give me the fucking money now!

You think I like you?

Give me the fucking money!

You want money?
Now!

Why are you following me?

I'm not. It's late, you should
be home, it's a school night.

What? Are you crazy now?

What the fuck is your deal, huh?
Keep away from me.

Why'd you let the guy
beat shit out of me?

Huh? You just sat there, like
a fucking lemon or something!

Excuse me,
I don't want to talk to you.

You don't think that there
is something wrong with that?

Listen,

Little kid, I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong.

But this isn't
the fucking answer, okay.

Go figure it out, because you're
gonna get really old, really quick.

You know that?
Why are you so mean to me? Huh?

You don't think that I have feelings?

Do you? Do you have feelings?

Listen, pa...
I mean between you and me...

You look like you got
more problems than me.

Oh really?

Yeah, really.
So, come on, I'll make it better.

What are you doing?
Get off, please.

Nothing, I'm just offering
to hang out if you want...

I don't wanna hang out with you
I don't know you seem kinda lonely,

Maybe we go back
to your place, just... relax...

You're afraid you'll like it?

I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

so many times, you've
gotten used to it.

Fuck you, man!

Fuck off, queer.

Have a good night, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, just walk away? Hey?

Where are you going?

"He just fucks their shit up and..."

"the ladies cried for me..."

"at the funeral."

"Because I ain't around no more to,"

"to dick that split up..."

"raw and shit..."

"And my boys all get faded..."

"Blazing that skunk shit and fuck."

Tony V.

You know, it's funny:
I spend a lot of time

trying to not have to deal,

To not really commit.

I am a substitute teacher,

there is no real
responsibility to teach.

The responsibility
is to maintain order,

make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

and then they get to the next period.

"She used to be a sweet girl."

"She never seemed dissatisfied
with her life..."

"and why should she have been?"

"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed..."

"So why did she become so angry,"

"so miserable
and mean all of a sudden?"

"We don't know."

"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

"We were good parents."

"But still, she repaid
us for all we've done"

"by killing herself."

"Stupid selfish child"

"Now she'll never
get into Princeton."

No name.

"Hi, it's Dean Vargus again"

"I can't do it anymore"

"I... I quit!"

Oh, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker!

Would you like a happy pill
to help you through the day?

They're yummy.

I need you to fill in for
Dean Vargus' second period.

I am worried about you, Charlie.

I just... really love watching
you leave the room.

Haha, Mr. Seaboldt, he maintains
a sense of humor.

I think the sense of humor is key,
I don't possess it...

I mean, I do...

in a tragic sort of way

Whatcha doing here, Mr. Sea?

Um, filling in for Dean Vargus.

Vargus is a bitch!

Talk shit,
and you get slapped like a bitch.

You're not gonna give
me no detention neither.

Or I'm gonna unfuck
your shit uptight.

Motherfucker.

Un... shit... No, unfuck your
shit uptight motherfucker.

Wow... that is, I mean really poetic.

I mean that's truly, what... lyrical.

You should take that on stage,

I mean that shit sells itself.

***

I'm going to unfuck your
shit, uptight, motherfucker.

I'll tell you ***

I'll unfuck your shit uptight...

I'll unfuck it right
uptight, up your ass...

You motherfucker!

I am going to unfuck your shit, uptight,
you motherfucker!

I'll tell you what, um...

Why don't you have a seat...

okay, and then um... I'll be back shortly
and we'll discuss your bright future.

Okay, my man?

I mean, my motherfucker.

Okay, Mae West?

Ellen, can I see your nipples?

What? No!

Wrong.

Actually, I can.

See, that's the whole point.
You have to wear bra to school.

Look, Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

I don't tell <i>you</i> how to dress,
so you don't tell <i>me</i>.

Capisce?

Ellen, you know what that is?

It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

It's really pretty, isn't it?

Now, that one...

Do you know what <i>that</i> is?

That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

That's fucking gross!

Yes, very.
So, you see,

when you come to school
dressed like that, you give...

you give out the wrong signal. Don't you
want people to treat you with respect?

Yo, I get respect. I don't give
it up to every dick in my face.

Every dick in your face.

That's respectful.

Put this on,
wear that for the rest...

I said,
wear that for the rest of the day.

Okay?

Can I go now?

I suppose you can, I mean...

if we're done.
Are we done?

We're done.
We're done.

Another student saved...

Come out of the bathroom, Grandma!

Come on, grandma, open the door.

Hi Grandpa.

Grandpa.

Grandpa?

You okay?

What is it Grandpa?

It's Henry, Grandpa.

Grandpa, it's Henry.

Who?
Are you in pain?

No, I... I pissed myself

Come on grandma, open the door!

Excuse me!

Excuse me?

Can you come in here, please?
You had a little accident?

Yeah...
You should...

See, we've taken care of it. See?

You're okay. Alright?

You doing any writing, Grandpa?

Been doing writing? In the journals?

No, my life...

My life isn't worth memoirs...

It's OK, it's okay...

I didn't want to go... off like this.

I hate being a burden.

You're not a burden, okay?

Not a burden.

Sure, knew you'd like coming here...

Your mother came by, today.

Have you spoken to her lately?

No.

Would you tell her I'm fine?

You always say you're fine,
but I know you hide things from me.

You've always been closed off.

Ever since you were an kid.

Why is that?

Why?

Ah... you're upset.
I shouldn't say these things to you...

I don't mean to make you...
You haven't upset me,

Grandpa

Listen, I don't want to
talk about the past.

You and I remember
it very differently.

Just rest, okay?
Close your eyes, I'm here.

I'll be here with you.
When you stop coming, Henry,

I'll die.

Fuck.

You got a smoke?

No, I don't have a smoke.

Where did you go, huh?

What are you gonna do now?
What are you gonna do, kid?

I don't know.

Can you lend me ten bucks?

Come on, man. I'm hungry.

I may have something
to eat at my place.

Come in, wash your hands.

There's soap over there.

Sit down.

Real nice place you got.

Thanks.

You got anything stronger?

Eat your sandwich.

Hey, hold on man!

It's a hundred bucks.

Relax...

What?

Have you been raped recently?

Why do you care?

I'm not sure that I do but ***

I haven't put something on.

Look, I got to get back.

Back?

Back where?

Listen, buddy...

You don't got the money,
it's cool, i mean...

I like you.

I'll blow you for 50.

Listen to me, knock off
the bullshit, okay?

Come in the bathroom.

It's going to sting a little bit...

Why are you doing this?

Take a shower.

This is fresh towel...
Thanks.

Go to sleep.

Hello, this is Dr. Parker.

My son's ADHD, and I looked it up online
and that's what he's got.

Now you gotta give
him his free laptop.

Mr. Kevin, your son
Oliver's injured students.

His problems are behavioral.

Hey, my kid's got a disability,
and he's not learning anything.

And it's your fault!

Hey hey...
What are you doing?

What is the matter with you?

As it is, our resources are emaciated and
I have real LD kids that need my attention.

He's always mad, all the time, because
he's not getting the services he need.

"No Child Left Behind" promises me my
right, you'll be hearing from my lawyer!

Mister...

Hey, what are you doing?

What is this?

What is this, funny?
Get to class, get to class right now.

What's the joke?
I didn't got the joke, huh?

Is this funny? Does that look good to
you? You like hurting animals? Huh?!

Is that what you like to do? Yes, you do.
You like hurting animals. You like this?!

Come here, go, let's go, come on.

Walk.

Mr. Raymond, studies
have shown that kids who

are proned to hurting
animals at an early age

eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

Evan,

how do you feel about this?

I feel...

trapped.

Like the cat.

Fuck.

Who are you? Hey, what? What?!

Did you pay her?
Did you pay her?

Did you pay her?

Yeah alright, here, yeah
yeah alright, here...

Alright, here...
What are you paying me for, huh?!

Wasn't in my mouth!

Get fuck out of here,
get out of here!

Fuck!

Don't hurt me!

Here...

Change your sheets!

How do you do it, kid?

Please, don't be mad at me.

I'm not mad at you.

And don't think about, you and me,

I won't do it anymore.

I promise.

You don't need to promise me

Okay, don't promise to me.
Whatever it is,

that you feel that you need to do,

you do it.

But you don't do it here!

Okay?

What are you doing there?

Don't you knock?

So what is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

Like happy with color.

What do you want from me, dad? Besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

I don't work all day...

To have my night ruining
by your teen angst.

*** might get you a full-right to
Stanford if your were some minority...

I am not going to support you...

and your little creative habits!

Okay? I've had it with all
your little art projects...

that are going nowhere!

You always know what to say, Dad.

No, if... if you grew your hair up,

and... lose some weight,

you could attract a nice boy
and, who knows...

There should be a...

prerequisite...

a curriculum for being a parent
before, people, attempt.

Don't try this at home.

Take these.

What are those?

You're supposed to ask me
<i>before</i> you take them.

They are vitamins and aspirin.

At some point, hum...

You should get an HIV test.

At some point.

Why were you crying on the bus?

Go to sleep.

A friend of yours?

A friend? Hum... No... No, no.

Of course he had no friends,
he was a....

Total asshole.

What was his problem?

He chose a vocation that
did not choose him...

I mean, he spent his whole career...

<i>"casting pearls before swine"</i>,
he talked like that...

***

He tried to purge Steinbeck and Faulkner
from our required reading list.

Oh yes.

Let it be said, from the
safety of his sabbatical ***

you can't do no more harm.

How did he die?

Who knows and... who cares?

Lupe, It's trudgery,
this life...

A detention, suspension,
expulsion...

the staff meetings,
the papers cuts,

the vacant parents,
their vicious kids,

they're the drags, Lupe.

They spat on my soul.

This humiliation will stop.

Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run.

***

It's fucking madness!

Like, every child has value?

Is a winner and worthier
*** for education?

Fucking kids who have
no desire, no fire,

no mind to peace...
*Adolf Hitler speech*

"Assimilate"

What does that mean?

To take something in.

Okay, excellent. To absorb.

"Ubiquitous"

Anyone?

Everywhere, all the time.

So what is...

"ubiquitous assimilation"

Always absorbing everything,
everywhere, all the time?

Well done, George.

How are you to imagine anything?

If the images are always
provided for you.

Who here read "1984" last year?

Good.

Anyone?

Meredith?

Having two opposing beliefs at once

and believing that both are true.

Excellent Meredith.

Why do you always suck his
dick, you fucking kiss ass?

To deliberately believe in lies,

while knowing they are false.

Examples of this, in everyday life.

Oh, I...

I need to be pretty... to be happy.

I need surgery... to be pretty.

I need to be thin...
famous... fashionable.

Our young men,

today,

are being told that women...
are whores...

bitches...
things to be screwed...

beaten...

shit on...

ashamed...

This is a marketing holocaust.

24 hours a day, for the
rest of our lives,

the powers that be
are hard at work...

dumbing us to death!

So, to defend ourselves...

and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processors.

We must learn to read,

to stimulate our own imagination.

To cultivate...

our own consciousness,

our own belief systems.

We all need these skills.

To defend,

To preserve,

Our own minds.

Just very carefully, that's perfect.

Great.

Look...

You just made your own tessellation.

Wow.

I don't care what they
say, you're doing great.

I had a hard time with maths too,
it takes time.

Wow, that is damn cool.

Hi guys,

thanks for staying late...

all... 15 or 20 of you.

Today we will be presented
with new course work,

engineered to boost state
exams performance,

as mandated by "No
Child Left Behind".

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to be here.

I've come today with some
edifying materials to

help your matriculated
and non-matric students

better prepare for the
upcoming state exams this May.

Let me start by stating
I love teachers...

I love what you do,
what you stand for,

You guys are the real heroes.

Now the one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

Is that...
real estate generate revenue.

And burgeoning property values
will be this school saving grace.

But your school's low test scores,

Are bringing down home resell
value in this neighborhood

during a market already in decline.

We gotta get scores up,

new families in our district,

and more motivated
kids in your school.

And I'm not placing any blame...

Excuse me, are you here
to sell some tests materials...

or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

Listen, umm... I am curious.

Are you giving away pop-corn
with this crap that you're pushing?

This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards and you tell us...

that our careers are
about resell value?

Bullshit!
Give him hell, lady.

Storm the gates.
Don't oversimplify, ma'am,

That's a *** you can't afford.

That sounds like a threat.

Can you... that's enough,
will you please sit down?

That's enough.

Could you please sit down...
Can we have some order here, please...

Dr. Hart was right,

Your school's the pride of the district.
Yeah, you bet pal.

Could you finish your pitch?
We'd like to go home.

What's your hurry, huh?

I hear they're putting
you out to pasture...

So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months

You're fossil
and you're fucking done!

Ever dread going home?

Lately I don't know what to do with
myself when I'm not in the classroom.

Some Friday afternoons,
I'm afraid to go home...

Afraid of all that time alone...

Yeah

My mother hates my
father passionately...

I'm there for them on
a permanent basis...

Watch a lot of TV...

Probably the only time
I don't feel naked...

Not a temporary one...

I teach for selfish reasons...
My mother was a Miss Madison...

You're better than that...
I need control...

I need those kids more than I should...
She does this great...

Her moments in the school
where all the moments...

It must *** up there
in front of them...

That's it, you ever had...

So what's your story?

My story?

I'm just umm...

I'm just taking one thing at a time.

Why are you wasting your life, you know
something to dodge?

I teach every day, I mean, when we...

I mean, you don't really know me.

So what happened to you?

You don't want something
more permanent?

Hi.
Where have you been?

What? I was out.

With a colleague.
A boy or a girl?

A woman.

You make me feel like so stupid,
why do you treat me like a kid?

Well, you are a kid.

I'm sorry, I wasn't
expecting this.

All you had to do is tell me
you're gonna be home later.

Well, back up, alright?

I am not beholden to you, okay?
I mean, you're welcome to stay here...

But, you don't have to get
expectations of me, alright?

This is a temporary thing, you...
you're able to stay here, but...

eventually you're gonna have to go,
you understand that?

I think it's important that...
It's clear.

I get it, you want me to go now?

I got better things to do
than clean up the stuff.

I can't believe you made dinner.

From what?

Groceries, from the grocery store...

Wow, it's really nice kid.

It's been a long time since
somebody cooked me a well-cooked meal.

Thank you Erica.

We all have problems, we all have
things that we're dealing with, right?

And we all...

take them home with us at night,

take them to work with
us in the morning.

I think that helplessness,
that realization,

that... foreboding of...

being adrift into sea

It's no...
<i>bowie</i>, no safety net.

When you thought you'd be the one
throwing the bowie.

Hi?

Anything for dinner?
Tell me all about it from the beginning.

You don't care.
Oh, no...

So untrue, love.

You are so condescending...

Give me a kiss.

Come on, go on talking,
it'll sort everything.

Come.
Stop it.

Do you remember...
when I bought you this?

That beautiful summer in Venice,

before I traveled through a resign to...
reviving old passions, hum?

"You suck!"

Flubby?
Yeah.

Grandpa, are you doing any writing?
In your journal?

No...

I don't remember much,

and lost the habit.
You can't think in this place

You can't make new memories.

Thank you.

Are you alright?
What?

You see me?
You see me standing here?

Yes, I see you.

Oh God, it's so relentless,
thank you.

Carol, there's no nice way for me to do
this. I've spoken with the superintendent,

he's agreed to let you ***
at the rest of the year.

It is what it is. Take your pension
and go to that beautiful house of yours.

Send Mr. Dearden my best...

Haven't you ever... had enough?

Haven't you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off?

I think I'm sick, I don't know...

Huh?
I crossed a line today...

I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

The whole thing is fucked, is it not?

What up, Dr. Parker?

Can we get this over with?
I got shit to do.

Okay, so what are your
plans after high school

Missy, since you're
not going to college?

I don't know, pfff...

Hang out with my boyfriend,
do some modeling shit...

Be in my friend's band...

Well, I have your *** grade report.
Do you know what it says?

F, F, F, F... - F.
F, F, F... yeah.

Do you know what that means?
It means you don't care.

You're brilliant.

Can I go now?

God, you are a shallow,
disgusting, creature.

You want to know the truth?

One: you're not gonna be in a band,

or a model Missy, because
you have no ambition.

With no skills, you'll be
competing with 80 % of the U.S.

workforce for a minimum wage job

which you'll work out for
the rest of your life

Until you're replaced by a computer.

I don't care
Two:.

The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

Your life will basically
become a carnival of pain.

And when you can't stand it,
not one more day,

not one more hour,

It will get worse, much worse!

Everyday I came in this
office and I listened

your kids to shit-off
all of yourself!

It is so easy to be careless,
it takes courage and character to care!

None of you have any
of these qualities.

Get out! Just get out! Get out!
Fuck you!

I'm a total burn out.
You are not.

I am.

I mean I don't know how you
make it through the day.

Listen. Seriously, why do you
think I take these pills for?

I mean, that's a rubber room in here.

If I didn't take these
things, I'd be...

I'd become a mass murderer
on half of these parents.

And I'd be helping them throwing their
fucking kids out the window, come on...

You're the best.

I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job...

is that nobody says "thank you".

No...
No.

Well, I am here to say thank you

For doing a job that none
of us could do. None of us.

Have I ever told you that you're
the only person I have to talk to?

Hi, Henry.
What happened?

They called your house,

Your grandfather felt some chest pains.
And?

The doctor says he's stable.

He doesn't have a lot of time.

I'm so sorry, Henry.

How long...
have you been here?

Since this morning. I didn't know
how to get a hold of you.

I don't know where you work.

Been here the whole day with him?

Hi Grandpa.

Still hanging in there I see, huh?

Ho, hey sweetheart.
Your mother was with me today.

Did you see her?

No
I told her I was afraid to leave you.

But... she promised.

That she'd look after you.
I'm sure she meant that.

Patricia, darling.

You've forgiven me, haven't you?

What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

Those things...
You know, the things I did.

All you ever did was take care of me.

Always look after me.
Weren't you afraid of me?

No, daddy. No, sir.

You know how you get sometimes,
you get a little mixed up.

You feel responsible for
things you didn't do.

So I wasn't the one that hurt you?

No sir, that wasn't you.

I hope it wasn't true.

Patricia, darling,
I've always loved you.

Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

Do you know that?
It's okay.

There is nothing to fear.

Come on.

Get out of here.

Is Patricia be your mom?

What happened to her?

She left a while ago.

You mean she died?

How did she die?

My father left when I was a kid,
I don't really remember him,

It was always the three of us,
Mother, Grandpa and I together.

In his house.

I found her... on the floor.

She'd taken enough pills, so...

And, Grandpa at the moment,
kinda lost it...

I sat with grandpa on the porch and we
watched as they came, took her away...

How old were you?

Seven.

I don't know for sure
but I think that, when

my mother was young,
something happened

With her and grandpa.
Were you afraid of it?

No.

Did she ever say anything to you?

No.

But, looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

How?

She made me lock my door at night.

The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned shame about it.

The Jungle Jim. The slide and the swing
have rusted together.

And also terribly alone now.

Where did all the children go?

Didn't they know
that the park needed them?

The child's intelligent heart can find
the depth of many dark places.

But it can not fathom a delicate
moment of his own detachment.

Hi Mr. Barthes.
Hi Meredith.

How's it going?
Fine, I'm alright...

I made a picture for you.

Come here.

You did?
Yeah.

Wow, it's beautiful, it's...
you're really talented.

Thanks
Have you been doing this for a long time?

I've been doing it since I was a kid.

A faceless man in an empty room.

Is that how you see me, Meredith?

I don't know how I see you,

This is just how I thought
of you in your situation.

I mean, didn't you ever think about who
your teachers were on the outside?

In real life?
I guess so, yeah.

Does this place seem unreal to you?

I watched you around the school and
you always seem so sad.

If you've a hard time with things...
and you need someone to talk to...

Meredith?
Yes?

Do you need someone to talk to?
Yeah, will you talk to me?

When you talk to me, it's like
you really see me.

I do see you Meredith.

Want to go see Dr.
Parker with me?

Oh, come on, don't blow me
off to the guidance counselor.

I'm not, I'm not...

What can I do?

It's like you said, we're...
we've *** into this.

There is nothing left, nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are.

It's not enough, I won't last.

Listen to me, just listen.

We are all the same, we all feel pain,
we all have chaos in our lives.

Life is very very confusing, I know.

I don't have the answers
but I know that if you write it out,

it will all be okay.

Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
Of course I do.

Meredith...
No, please...

Meredit, I'd like to help you...
Please, please...

You don't...
You said you liked me, please...

Please, please...

Oh please, don't push me
away, please Just hold on

to me and tell me that
everything is gonna be okay.

Everything is okay.
It is okay.

Meredith, wait a second

What is going on?
What?

Hey, Meredith?
What were you just doing?

Meredith, I am sorry.

What were you doing?
What?

What are you doing?

Excuse me?!
You were just touching her!

What are you...
what are you insinuating?

It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

It's inappropriate?
She needed someone to talk to.

What do you think I'm doing? Huh, lady?
I don't know what you're doing.

Just hold me close.

What do you think I am fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

She needed someone to talk to her.

Well then why were you touching her?
I wasn't touching her

***

Patricia

I'm not... not some sick old man!

Is that what you think of me?

Is that what you think?

I just wanted to help her!

Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
What am I supposed to think?

You're supposed to ***
fucking judgmental!

Hello? No, he's not home.

Hello Mr. Barthes.

Whenever you feel like you're ready
we do have some paperwork downstairs,

that we need you to take care of.

I'm sorry.

I wish things were different.

I tried, you know, fuck
that thing is... we all...

We all have problems, we all have
things that we're dealing with, right?

Some days we're better than
others, some days we're

not so great, some days
we have limited space

for others.

***

Want some milk?

These kids need... something else.

They don't need me.

You're okay?
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

You know, you can't keep
living on the street.

I'm not, I mean I'm
staying here with you.

Well, you can't continue
to stay here with me.

I'm not good for you.
It's not true.

You're like the only
family I've ever had.

Well, I can't be your family.

I can't give you what you need.

You have to understand, you should be...
You are good...

and gentle...

you are the most kind...

I love you Henry.

Come on in.
Hi.

Hello there.

Erica...
Don't let them take me...

Please...

Nooo...
Listen, you have to...

You are all that I have, please...

Don't let me go...

No, no...

Henry! Henry!

Henry! Henry!
You have to let go now.

Henry! Henry!
Come on.

No! No!...
It's gonna be okay.

Don't do this!

It'll be okay.
No! No! No!

No!...

Well, I feel just awful for her.

For who?
Our school.

It may sound baroque but I've always
felt that the school had a spirit.

These aren't just dull ***,
but they're alive.

I just don't understand it:
Where are all the parents?

I don't know.

I was in my room for two hours and saw one
parent, where are they? Where is everybody?

We don't know.
It's uncanny.

No air raid sirens, no bombs.

Doesn't happen that way.

Starts in whisper, and then nothing.

We had our music once, didn't we?

Yes, we did.

Do you remember these nights, when
we had two parents at a time?

And then there were more, there were
many more waiting in the waiting ***

The halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.

In remembrance of things passed.

I actually felt quite at home.

There were no parents.

I thought "how appropriate".
It was like, a moment of insight.

The reality of the fucking problem
in the first place.

Some of us believe that
we can make the difference.

And then sometimes, we wake up

and we realize we failed.

Hi, this is Gretchen calling
from the free clinic.

Erica Louis' test results are back,

please get us a call at
your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

You have good parents.
You shut up.

Meredith.
Her mother and I gave her...

You dike bitch!

What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

... nothing but to
realize how fucked up...

Sorry you're picking a fight.
Paint something cheerful...

We all have chaos in our lives...
Grow your hair, lose some weight...

It will all be okay.

Good morning.
Morning.

Alright, before we take roll,

I want to tell you that...
today will be my last day with you.

You're gonna have a permanent
teacher on Monday.

Where're you going, Mr. Barthes?
I'll go to another school.

We'll miss you, man. *** with you.
Yeah?

All those teachers in
this place... they're dickheads.

You don't get tired of
moving around all the time?

It's how my job works, Tania.
I come in here for a period of time...

so you don't have 20 subs in
and out of here and then...

you have a permanent
teacher come in and...

and I leave.

"Attention to all teachers,
this is a special

announcement from the
principal's office."

"There will be an all-faculty
meeting today, during nutrition."

"Student nutrition will be extended"

"for ten minutes, thank you."

I invited you here, today,
to discuss the state of things.

I know that there wasn't...
I know that there isn't...

I'm sorry...
We all need something

to distract us from...
complexity, and reality.

No one wants to think about
where that came from?

No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes...

To become somebody, to get out of...

to get out of the...

sea of pain that we all
have to get out off.

Hi Meredith
Hey.

Haven't seen you in class lately.

Where have you been?

Baking.
Oh, I see.

Yeah.

I'm happy I get to see you, you know.
It's my last day.

How ironic!

Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself but...

maybe you could...
make better use of it.

I like that the best.
Can't have that one, it's mine.

You can have this one?

It's better for you anyway.
Thanks.

I'm sorry.

If I hurt you, in any way. I um...

I know... that it's tough
right now, for you...

But it's not...
Goodbye, Mr. Barthes.

Goodbye Meredith.

They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to a temporary problem,

I'll let you know.

My name is Meredith and
I want to kill myself.

Meredith.

Henry

It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

We have such a responsibility to guide
a young so that they don't end up...

falling apart,

falling by the wayside,

becoming insignificant.

I realized something today.

I'm a non-person, Sarah.

You shouldn't be here.

I'm not here.

You may see me...
but I'm hollow.

Failing...
we're failing.

Failed in the sense that we...
have left... everyone down.

Including ourselves.

Walking on the hallway, or in class,

how many of you... have ever felt
the weight pressing down on you?

I have.

Everyone? Well, Poe wrote about
these things over 100 years ago.

So, as we read...

we can see that the House of Usher
is not merely an old...

decrepit castle in disrepair.

It's also a state of being.

<i>During the whole of a dull,
dark, and soundless day</i>

<i>in the autumn of that year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

<i>I had been passing alone,
on horseback,</i>

<i>through a singularly
dreary tract of country;</i>

<i>And at length found myself, as the
shades of the evening drew on,</i>

<i>within view of the
melancholy House of Usher.</i>

<i>I know not how it was</i>

<i>but, with the first glimpse
of the building, a</i>

<i>sense of insufferable
gloom pervaded my spirit.</i>

<i>I looked upon the simple
landscape of the domain,</i>

upon the bleak walls, upon the
white trunks of decayed trees

<i>with an utter depression of soul.</i>

<i>There was an iciness,</i>

<i>a sinking,</i>

<i>a sickening of the heart.</i>
