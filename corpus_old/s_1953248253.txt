<i>[ Engine revving ]</i>

Miko: Hoo-yah!

Bulkhead: Oh!

Munched!

Male announcer: <i>Give it up</i>

<i>for the baddest beast machines</i>
<i>on the planet!</i>

[ Computer beeping ]

Would you mind
lowering the volume?

Hey, Ratch, check out
the monster-truck rally

Miko took me to last week.

I compiled some highlights
with my cellphone.

Innocent vehicles battling

for the pleasure
of human spectators?

[ Groans ]
Blood sport.

Yeah! Yeah!

You could be helping Optimus
in the field right now.

Aw, he doesn't need
my help

to search for some ancient
educational thingamabob.

The "thingamabob"
to which you refer

happens to be
a cybertronian data cylinder.

[ Television beeps ]

Hey!
[ Groans ]

And there is no telling

what vast intelligence
it may hold.

During the golden age,

dozens of these cylinders
were created,

each containing the sum total
of cybertronian knowledge

on any given subject...

[ Yawns ]

Stellar cartography,
medicine, ancient mythology.

When the war broke out,

the cylinders were hidden
throughout the galaxies

to keep them as far as possible
from Decepticon reach.

Detecting one signal here,
on Earth,

is the opportunity of a...

[ Groans ]
T.M.I., dude.

Switch it back!

I want to see
the hoedown showdown!

[ Beeping ]

<i>Ratchet,</i>
<i>Decepticon ambush.</i>

<i>The cylinder is at risk.</i>

<i>We require backup.</i>

Backup
is what I'm built for.

Go bend some fenders,
Bulk.

I have an important mission
for you, too, Miko.

Really?

Aw! [ Groans ]

[ Sighs ]

Ooh!

Ooh!

[ Panting ]

Whoa.

Optimus:
Autobots, stand your ground.

The artifact must not
fall into enemy hands.

[ Engine revs ]

Come to papa.

Run to mommy.

Say "Uncle."

Say it!

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Cellphone dialing ]

Ratchet, come in.

Miko?

This is
an emergency channel.

We need to keep it open for
the auto... [ thudding ]

Wait.
Where are you?

D'oy!
I'm with the thingamabob.

Thingama...
The data cylinder!

Yes. Can you bridge it
out of here?

I'll reactivate
arrival coordinates.

[ Warbling ]

Dude, can you
open it any closer?

Supply coordinates.

Um...50 yards?

<i>Precise</i> coordinates.

[ Crash ]
Wha!

[ Breathes heavily ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Panting ]

1...2...

[ Grunts ]

[ Warbling ]

[ Whirring, clicking ]

Whoa.

Miko?

No!

[ Groans ]

[ Groans ]

Bulk!

You really took one
for the team, Bulkhead...

<i>My</i> team.

Bulkhead, are you...

Fine.

It didn't even smart.

I helped lose that thing.
I want to help find it.

I need to get back
in the field with Optimus.

Eh, eh, you're under
my watch now.

Optimus' orders.

And running a full scan
of your neural net

would be a wiser use
of your time.

Come on, doc.

There's nothing up there
to scan.

He seems fine to me.

[ Sighs ] Well, if you insist
on making yourself useful,

you can help
Miko tidy up.

Aw!
He's mad with power.

[ Laughs ]
That's Ratchet.

No vector squared,
all right.

What?!

Hey, we got any paint
around here?

Art project? Cool!

What do you mean,
it's empty?

Lord Megatron,

these cylinders are not
unlike batteries.

The data is stored within them
as a form of energy.

It scanned fully charged...

That's how we located it
to begin with...

But now...

[ Sizzles ]

Dead battery.

Did you drop it,
you one-eyed oaf?!

No, master.

I wasn't gonna
touch the thing

after it put the zap
on Bulkhead.

Hey, you think...

I know.

And I must find out
what that vessel contained.

When it comes to the secrets
of the ancients,

knowledge can be power.

Seriously, Ratch,

you need to see
what Bulk's painting in here.

Yes, I'm sure one
hasn't truly lived

until one has beheld

Bulkhead's take on still life
with lug nuts.

See? Did I tell you
or what?

The differential of one-third
"R" cubed is RDRR.

Ratchet:
That is not art.

It's science.

Ratchet: This hot spot
you see here...

It's information, data,
living energy.

Miko: Hold on.

It's alive, it's on fire,

and it's
in Bulkhead's brain?

Chill, Miko.

The data's only inhabiting
a fraction of my brain,

infinitesimal by standard
neural-net densities.

Wait.
How do I know all that?

Based on what we witnessed
during our skirmish,

the living data must have been
programmed to eject

when it sensed
unauthorized access.

A security measure.

It would have jettisoned
heavenward, lost to the stars.

Except my fat engine block
got in the way.

Every 'con there
made a grab for it,

but the cylinder doesn't go off
until Miko touches it?

The cylinders originated
from Cybertron's golden age,

predating the Autobot / Decepticon
division.

So it wouldn't consider
any native of Cybertron

to be a reat.

Only alien life forms,
such as humans.

[ Buzzes ]

Are we staring at genius
or gibberish?

I do not wish to falsely
rally anyone's hopes,

but these equations
appear to be the formula

for a synthetic energon.

[ Buzzing ]

We hit the mother lode?

Miko, do you understand
what this means?

Um...

Energon provides our fuel,
our ammo, our life force.

With the natural stuff
in such short supply

here on Earth,

this could solve a whole lot
of problems.

Such as providing us
with the edge we need

to turn the tide
of this war.

Or handing us the key
to revitalizing Cybertron.

We got the goods,

and all Megatron got
was an empty bucket.

How often do I get to use
my noggin to save the day?

Bulkhead: Intersection
of atomic coordinates

indicate convergent
tertiary structures...

Aren't you done yet?!

Resulting
in an asymmetric...

Got to admit,

it's weird seeing Bulk
in brainiac mode.

[ Buzzing ]

Vector l1 norm squared.

Break time!

How about a lightning round
of "TNT Street Racer 7"?

Energon temperatures
and volume proportion...

Aw!

Angle trisector
construction.

Got another round
for you to log, Ratchet.

This is Bulkhead's neural net
as you saw it earlier.

[ Computer beeping ]

This scan was recorded
just minutes ago.

It is as I feared.

The data seems to be
actively and aggressively

rewriting
Bulkhead's neural net.

I had hoped
he was purging the data,

but he seems to be merely
transcribing it as it...

Consumes his mind.

From all indications,

by the time Bulkhead
completes the formula,

his own thoughts, his memories
could be wiped clean.

But if we stop him,
goodbye, synthetic energon.

You assume we possess
a means of stopping him.

I don't exactly have
instant access

to the wisdom
of the ancients.

I will not allow another one
of our own to be sacrificed,

no matter the cost.

If the living data transmitted
itself from the cylinder,

perhaps we could somehow
coax it back inside.

How are we supposed to get it
back from the Decepticons?

Megatron
will bring it to us.

Bulkhead: Coefficient quotient
of the subset amplified...

Miko:
You want amplified?

Proving preceptor's paradox
is nothing of the kind.

[ Electric guitar plays ]

Aah!

What is that?!

Metal.
You love this song.

I'm trying to concentrate.

[ Groans ]

You're starting to sound
just like Ratchet!

Who?

Ratch, I think
Bulk's losing his mind.

You...already know.

Miko, we didn't want
to frighten you.

But rest assured,
Optimus has a plan.

Optimus
isn't Bulkhead's doctor.

I just need to know,

when Bulk's done spitting out
that formula,

he'll go back to being
regular old Bulkhead, right?

Knockout:
Lord Megatron,

we've detected
a familiar energy profile.

The data?

Bulkhead must have left

the shielded radius
of their base.

Breakdown and I will...

Fail me again?

Optimus.

You're certainly not the Autobot
I expected to find here.

But let me guess.

You rigged a transponder
to mimic the frequency

of the data I seek.

Megatron,
I have a proposal.

I'm...Listening.

Surrender the cylinder,

and I will return it to you
fully restored.

This trinket right here?

And, pray tell,
what trifles did it hold

that you are so anxious
to give away?

Accept my terms,
and you will find out.

[ Growls ]

Do you remember the time

you watched wheeljack
lob his only grenade

into the Decepticon
heat exchanger?

Who?

Wheeljack!
Your best bud?!

Besides me, of course.

Oh! Do you even know
who <i>I</i> am?

Of course.

You're...

Equivalent to the flattening
of the oblate spheroid

to the nth power.

Internal energy of isolated "E"
remains constant.

Keep them coming,
Bulkhead.

Come on.

You want to finish your formula,
don't you?

Optimus: Do you accept
my proposal?

Knockout:
Lord Megatron.

Give me a moment.

Did you find
what you were looking for?

It's complicated.

Well, breakdown and I
may have located the bogey,

fully charged.

Proceed.

Just one hitch.
We don't have the cylinder.

Then bring me
the head of Bulkhead.

Miko: Look!
You love monster trucks.

Remember when we snuck in here
after the show last week?

Mass times diffusion rate
squared is constant.

Is any of this
ringing a bell?

Bell curve?

No, no, no.
That wouldn't factor in.

How about our Sunday-morning
dune bashings,

rocking out to slash monkey,
helping me with my homework?

Ha! Trick question!

You know
I don't do homework.

Don't you?

Okay, forget the past.

Starting now,
we can make new memories.

The cube root of the exothermic
energon yield Delta "E"

violates clank's law
of energon conservation.

Bulkhead, I know
somewhere inside,

you will
always remember me,

and I just want you to know
I'll never forget you.

Breakdown:
Boo-hoo!

I'm shedding lubricant.

Follow me right now,
or these guys are gonna...

Steal the formula!

My equations?

Come on, come on!

Not like Bulkhead
to run from a fight.

I'm afraid our friend

has had a little too much
to think.

Lord Megatron,
we're good.

Optimus,
upon careful consideration,

if you want the cylinder,
you'll have to take it.

Okay, then.
Fun and games.

[ Singsong voice ] Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

[ Warbling ]

[ Groans ]

The 'cons are scrambling
the signal.

Bulkhead: The trisector of the
polygon is an integral subset.

Shh! Quiet!

And whatever you do,
keep still.

I'm gonna see if I can get
far enough to call for backup.

Bulkhead...

Is that you?

[ Grunts ]

Breakdown,
forget the human.

Games are only fun to play...

[ Beeping ]

When you're winning.

[ Warbling ]

[ Beeping ]

I think I'm warm.

En3 divided by the square root
of the propulsion factor

equals...

You painted my paint job!

Prepare for surgery!

Heads, you lose.

No!

Well, in that case,
no one gets it.

Ratchet: Optimus, Bulkhead
and Miko have abandoned base.

I have their ground bridge
coordinates.

Bridge us back immediately.

[ Warbling ]

Aah!

Not again!
Get down!

[ Gasps ]
I did it again?

Bulkhead?

[ Warbling ]

Dead battery.

Megatron will peel our paint
for losing that data.

So we're gonna
have to peel you.

Or peel out of here.

[ Tires screech ]

[ Miko sobbing ]

Bulkhead...

[ Sobbing continues ]

Ratchet: The data has been
fully expelled,

but Bulkhead remains
completely unresponsive.

Because the energy took
Bulkhead's mind with it,

heavenward,
lost to the stars.

[ Sniffles ]

It's my fault you'll never know
the rest of the formula,

and it's my fault
Bulkhead's gone forever.

Miko, your quick thinking
prevented the formula

from falling
into Decepticon hands.

If anyone would have
backed that play, it's Bulkhead.

It's simply too early to know
the extent of his condition.

Something as simple
as a familiar sight or smell,

perhaps even a sound,

could trigger
Bulkhead's awakening.

[ Buzzing ]

[ Audio feedback ]

[ Electric guitar plays ]

[ Monitors buzzing ]

[ Groans ]

Bulkhead?

[ Imitates electric guitar ]

I love that song!

Miko?
