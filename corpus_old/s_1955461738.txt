In 1917,
I signed up to fight the Huns in France.

Good men died all around me.
I saw no reason for it.

The rules we lived by were lies and they
didn't apply to those who made them.

I swore If I made it home...

...I would never follow orders again.

I left a soldier I came home an outlaw.

I lived one robbery to the next.

A good day was filled by sleep...

...and a good night spent running
too hard to look back.

I lived that life for 10 years...

...until it caught up to me.

It all started with an inside man.

The Albert White crew was playing
a high stakes poker game...

...and our inside man left
the back door open for us.

Where's the fuckin' money?
You know whose fuckin' place this is?

Give it! Well, you know whose fuckin'
card game this is, you fuckin' dunce?

You heard of Albert White?
Keep talkin', bimbo!

Miss, come here!

Do you want a drink to go with your robbery?
No, just the money, put it in the bag.

What's your name? Emma Gould.

What's yours?
You gonna put a sock in me mouth?

That's right. A sock? In my mouth?

Never been used before
and I wouldn't lie to you.

That's what all the liars say.

Open up.

Great!

Our boy's here. Let's go!

You got some balls.

Slow down and stop driving
like we did something. Relax

Made out pretty good.
It was a nice hit. Yeah, it's all mine.

Very funny. Look forward! Drice the car!

Good afternoon, I'm Albert White.

You must be Joe.

Coughlin.
Goodood to put a face to the name.

This is Brandon Lumas...friend of mine.
How are you?

You're too smart for the stuff
you been pullin'.

Nickel and dimin' with two dumb guineas.

They're your friends but
they're stupid and they're Whops.

And they won't live to see forty.

Take your time.

But you can't work on your own.

Not in this town.

Albert was rounding up the troops.

They was a war going on...

...over rum.
Dermott, go and have a word.

Albert White ran the Irish mob...

...and Maso Pescatore ran the Italians.

It was tit for tat.

The daedliest year
in the history of Boston.

White's gang set fire to rum trucks.

And a guy on Maso's payroll went home
with a girl no one had seen before.

The winner...disorder mess.

I wanted nothing to do with
Albert White and his war.

But I didn't have a choice.

His girlfriend was my inside man.

And I was in love with her.

He'd kill her if she tried to leave him
and he'd kill us both...

...10 times over if he found out
we were together.

But we were in love and we were stupid.

And every time he was out of town,
we were together.

The fit was perfect.

Mind if I join you?

Sorry father,
but I've been waiting for someone. No!

Emma, this is my father, Tom Coughlin.

Dad, this is my friend Emma Gould.

Pleasure, Ms. Gould Mind if I sit down?

Where are you from, Miss Gould?
Dorchester.

No, I meant before.
You're clearly Irish.

On my mother's favor from Cork. Really?
What's her maiden name?

I don't know.

You don't know?
She died. She's dead, me mamso

So, what is it you do?

It's a really swank place this,
isn't it?

I know well how my son earns a living.

I can only assume that if
you've come into contact with him.

It was either during a crime
or in an establishment...

...populated by rough characters.

Are my questions making
you feel uncomfortable?

I don't know what you're on about...

...and to be honest,
I don't really care.

I'm on about you being the type of
lassie who consorts with criminals...

The fact that the criminal is my son
isn't the issue.

It is that my son is still my son...

and I have feelings that cause me
to question the wisdom of...

...consorting with the type of woman
who knowingly consorts with criminals.

Did you follow all that?
Enough, Dad. Enough, ok?

My uncle mentioned a copper
on his payroll, name of Coughlin.

Is that you?

This uncle would be your Uncle Robert?

Who everyone knows as Bobo?

The police officer you
refer to is Elmer Conklin.

He stays in...He collects shakedowns from
illegal establishments such as Bobo's.

I rarely get out of Dorchester Still,
as Deputy Superintendent...

I'd be happy to take
a greater interest in BoBo.

I need to powder.

Was that necessary?

I didn't start the fight, Joseph...

...so don't criticize me
for how I finished it.

I've been a police officer for 37 years...

...and I've learned one thing above all.
Do you know what it is?

It's gonna to be another
yarn from the old country. No.

What you put out in the world
will always come back to you.

But never how you predict.

I'm sure it doesn't.

Unearned confidence of that
about which one is ignorant...

...always has the brightest glow.

I think I've heard enough.

She's quite easy on the eyes.

Yeah, she is.

Apart from that, I fail to see what
you see in her. She's from Dorchester

Well, that doesn't help. Her father's
a pimp, her uncle killed two men.

I could overlook all that,
Joseph, if she wasn't...

She just doesn't pretend
to be something she's not.

Maybe she's just asleep.

Thanks for stopping by.

Maybe you should climb
under his covers tonight. What?

He looked at me like I'm trash!

We're not people.

We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.

We tat the lace for your fuckin'
carpets. Jesus.

Don't fuckin' touch me!

My whole life,
I got the high hat and the icy mitt...

...from people like your father.

We're not less than you.

I never said you were.

Oh, well, he did. Fuck him! Ok?

I love you.

We can glow so easy.

I know.

Fuck!

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Let go.

Spare two bits?

Thanks a lot.

Joe Coughlin. Got an invitation.

I gotta check you.

Go ahead.

Joseph? Joe Coughlin, yeah.

Do you know who I am?

I know enough to show up
here when I'm asked.

My name is Maso Pescatore.

I run the North End and liquor
coming up from Florida.

I'm the man with the power
of other mens' lives in my hands.

but the truth is...

...I'm just a simple wop
from the old country.

Today,
my only true rival is Albert White.

When that is no longer the case...

we can see an end to the fighting
that has plagued this town.

Well, I got no beef with you.

But I don't truck with gangsters,
not even a sheik like you.

You do soup jobs and stickups...

...but you're not a gangster.

What does that make you?

I don't know.

An outlaw, I guess.
I just don't want any part of that life.

How many things, good or bad, come to us
whether we ask for them or not.

For example, one of my men
saw you with a young lady...

Well, not so much a lady,
but a putana whose date is Albert White.

So, it no longer matters
so much what you want.

You're in this life...

and it can only end two ways.

One. You get to Albert
and put an end to him.

Two. I tell Albert about the girl
and he gets to you first.

Like I said...

I ain't a gangster.

I've done enough killin' in this life.

If you want to tell your enemy
some rumor you heard, go ahead.

If I kill Albert White, someone's just
going to jump up and take his place.

And I'll be married to the Pescatore mob
for the rest of my life.

I stopped kissing rings a long time ago.

Good afternoon.

Do you think he told Albert?

I'd be dead already. Christ!

We could leave.

Where would we go?

Somewhere warm.

My brother Danny lives in California.
Where?

I don't know.
I haven't talked to him for ten years.

He sent back a bunch of postcards sayin'
he was doing stunts, trying to be a writer.

God, I'd go to California. I don't know
much about honest work, I gotta tell you.

Well, who said anything
about honest work? Good!

We do what we want to do,
go where we want to go.

Sleep by day.

I got a job in Lawrence on Saturday,
then I'll be free.

Free to leave? Yeah, free to leave.

I have to see you-know-who on Saturday.
Fuck you, no! That's the idea.

Oh, come on, what's the alternative?
You want to wind up in the...?

I'm supposed to meet him
at the Statler on Saturday.

Turns him on to see me
when his wife's on his arm.

After that,
he's going to Detroit for a week.

Will you clean yourself up
and get to the Statler by 7?

I think I can clean myself up
and get to the Statler by 7.

Shut up.

The Lawrence Bank job, we got
enough to get us to California on.

It's true,
that's what I was thinkin' about.

Let's go!

What are you doing?

Start! Start!

Look out! Look out!

Fuck!

Watch out!

Get outa the way!

Fuck it!

Move! Get out of the fuckin' way!

What?

God!

Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Shit!

I walked half a mile,
stole a car in North Reading...

...and replaced it with a Dodge
I found in Summerville

I came back to my childhood home
and considered my options.

The story was in all the Late Editions.

The third dead cop was a trooper who
pulled someone over near the state forest.

It had to be Dion.

Keep going!
There's a Service Elevator up here.

I can't believe you came!
Where was I going to go?

I don't know. It's not what people do.
It's what I do.

Shit, shit, shit!

Why you crying?

Because I love you.

Then smile. I can't.

I'm sure as you die, you'll
tell yourself you did it for love.

No, you feel guilty about what you do.

So you spend your life hoping
someone will punish you for your sins.

Well...

Here I am. Joe, I'm so sorry!

She's sorry, we're all fuckin' sorry.
Take her out of here.

You said you wouldn't kill him Albert,
that was the deal!

Don't worry.
I would never have brought him here...

I'm going to be humiliated by a whore?

Someone close to me says some...

...arsehole is puttin'
a hole into my fuckin' head...

You're lucky I didn't cut your tits off
and throw you in the fuckin' dump.

Take her to the car, Donny.
Sorry! Sorry!

Ah, it's ok.

You should be more worried
about what I'm going to do to you.

Don't kill her.

What the fuck do you care?
She just sold you down the the river.

I wasn't honest.

I said if she delivered you to us,
I wouldn't kill you.

But we both know I have to kill you,
don't we, Joe.

And then I'm going to kill her too.

Leave him, let's get out of here.

So you're a cop killer now, Joseph?

I didn't kill anybody.

Looks like your friends were about to
take you on the dead man's drive.

Dad, they're going to kill her.

Well, we won't kill you, Joseph...

...but some of my coworkers
would like a word.

Please, Dad! Oh, I'm going to kill him!

She's in the car with Donnie Gishler!

I don't know what his skull's
made of but it isn't bone.

In a coma two weeks.
No cranial bleeding.

No loss of memory or speech disabilty.
His nose and half his ribs are broken.

It'll be a long time before he doesn't
see any blood in the bowl. Go on in.

Dad, where is she?

Did they find her?

We followed her and Donnie Gishler.

His car went off the road
and into the ocean at 9:20.

An officer from Beverly dove in lookin'
for them.

Ended up in the hospital
for a week with hypothermia.

She was Albert White's girl.
She betrayed you.

She did...

And?

I'm crazy about her. Crazy isn't love.

I saw your marriage for 18 years.
It wasn't love.

No, no it wasn't.

Anyway, she's gone. She's as
dead as your mother, God rest her..

They caught up with Paolo in St. Albans,
about 10 miles from the border.

A number of officers gave chase.

He was struck by at least 14 rounds...

...low for a cop killer.

What about Dion?
It's possible he made the border.

You were the child that was supposed to fix
the distance between me and your mother.

were you aware of that?

I was aware of the distance.

People don't fix each other.

They never become anything
but what they've always been.

All we get sometimes is a little luck.

Do not waste your's
pining for a dead girl.

You make your own luck.

Sometimes, sometimes it makes you.

If he pleads guilty, I can take
the death penalty off the table.

3 years out, 20 probation.

Three years?
There are 3 dead police officers.

And he didn't kill them.

He may be the son
of the Deputy Superintendent...

...but he will long know the
inside of the Charlestown Prison.

I promise you. Chief Inspector,
I was demoted yesterday.

Then we can leave unsaid the notion
I was going to dispell for you.

I have no illusions.
I'm a practical man.

The photograph is of a door
to a rowhouse in Back Bay...

...where you have been keeping time
with a young man of Mexican descent.

If you move the location of your
liasons, I will know within the hour.

Let me see what I can do.

Seeing what you can do
is of little interest to me.

<i>Federal Prison Of Charleston</i>

I pled guilty to
abetting armed robbery...

...and was given 3 years and 4 months
in the Charlestown prison.

If my father had lived 2 more weeks...

I could have said goodbye.

I got one guaranteed life...

...and I was going to live it.

I would use Maso and his
hatred for Albert to get me started.

Funny, how things change.

What happened to all the talk
about not being a gangster?

Now you come to me looking for a job.

I got nothin' left.

I don'tt want to be a gangster.

But I'll work for one if I
can get to Albert White.

From what I heard in prison,
you're still the man to see about that.

We ran Albert White
out of Boston like you heard.

Now he's making a run to our
rum operation in central Florida.

He won't stand by.

It's true,
I could use someone who is committed...

...to putting an end to Mr. White.

You found your man right here.

Your duty would always have to be...

...to the Pescatore Family first,
then yourself second.

Can you live with that? It sounds fair.

I just need one guy,
Dion Bartolo from my old crew...

...to help me go down there and set up.

It's good to have someone you can trust.

It's hot down there. I don't mind hot.

You ain't never felt hot like this one.

If it's not as wet as in Charlestown,
I could use the change.

Then get the narcotics running,
starting in Tampa.

Frank Ormino runs Tampa.

He's gonna decide
he doesn't need the headache.

When's he gonna decide that?
10 minutes after you get there.

I see, so I gotta make you
and me equal partners?

No! Frank Ormino's an equal partner.

But look what's gonna to happen to him.
I guess I work cheap.

Can you tolerate
an Irishman in your crew?

This is America. I've lived worse.

<i>Ybor City Station Florida</i>

I realized it's not
enough to break the rules.

You have to be strong enough
to make your own.

Joseph!

How ya doin'? You! Look at you!

Hey, sorry about your father.
Yeah, sorry about your brother.

Thank you, thank you

Listen, when Lefty Downer
found me in Montreal...

...told me the Pescatores wanted
me to come work for them...

I thought it was a straight bamboozle.

Then I thought...

...if anyone could charm the devil,
it's my old partner. Look at this!

Holy shit! Would you look at this?

Here, after you.
Get the fuck outta here!

I work for you now, Boss Joe Coughlin.

Reach under the seat
and you'll find a friend.

Welcome to Ybor.

The Harlem of Tampa.

The gods built this place.
What you're smellin' now...

...probably bolos or empanadas.

The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.

As far as they're concerned...

...we're a bunch of dirty
Spics and Whops and...

...we can fuck off and
do what we need to do...

...as long as we leave them alone.

You'd think we could all get along...

...but it don't work out that way.

The Italians and the Cubans
keep to themselves.

But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards.

And the Spaniards look at all
Cubans like they're uppity Coons...

...who forgot their place since
America freed them in '98.

The Cubans and the Spanish,
they look down on the Puerto Ricans...

...and everyone, I mean everyone,
shits on the Dominicans.

The Italians only respect you
if you came off the boat.

How you doing, Laney?

And the white people think anyone
gives a shit what they think.

You're a fuckin' piece of work.

Port of Tampa!

Who is it? Fireplace..

Thanks, JT. No worries.

There is a whole network of tunnels
like this underneath the city.

Who owns this warehouse?
Frank Ormino did.

What do you mean Ormino did?

Ormino sprung a few leaks the other day.

That was quick. Look at this over here.

The best money can buy.

You gotta keep it at 186 Fahrenheit.

Yeah, these babies never lie.

Try to keep people from dying
when they drink your hootch.

Made a lot of toilet booze in prison,

...looks to me like you're
missing two key ingredients.

Which are? People and glasses.

Yeah, we got a problem. Why?

Our distributor...
he's been comin' up empty.

What is this?

The boats have been sinkin'
What's his name?

Gary L. Smith.

Gary Elsmith.

No, Gary L. Smith

It's a middle initial. I don't know...

...he wants people to use it.
It's a Southern thing.

Not just an asshole thing? Both!

Thank you, Miss Roe.

You must be Maso's new find.

Well, I guess, somethin' like that.

How ya doin'?

So what brings you by?

I've been asked to take over
Frank Ormino's affairs.

Hope that's not permanent! No offense.

None taken. Why is that?

Folks like dealing with who they know...

...and nobody knows you.

I see. Well, what would you suggest?

I have no ambitions for it but...

...to keep continuity...
...instead of doin' it for a term.

Well, we're mostly concerned with
why the last 3 supply runs were hit.

Well, that's the Cubans.
Then let's just go to a new supplier.

It's not that simple. Why not?

Well, because they're all paying
tribute to the Suarez family.

That's the Cubans that are all
down in that club on 7th, right?

We're going to need to
talk to them soon.

I'm afraid you don't understand
how things are done here.

I deal with Mr. Suarez and his sister.

If you want, I'm sure we can arrange
a table by tomorrow night, 9 o'clock.

Great!

Now, Gary L., tell me this.
Do you work directly for Albert White?

Or is there some intermediary
I should know about as well?

What? We marked your bottles.

You what?
If you distilled it, we marked it.

And all these runs that
were supposedly lost at sea...

somehow made their way
into Albert White's speakeasies.

Can you explain that?

No, I don't understand.

Dion drove me by your house
on the way over here.

You got a lovely place.

You're gonna have
to bag up all that shit...

and send it to wherever
it is you're going.

Where am I goin'? Are you fuckin' her?

What? Who? Miss Roe.

What?

He's fuckin' her!
Without question, definitely.

Aw, c'mon! Afternoon taste of Miss Roe?

Sugar in the mornin', sugar in...whatever.
I don't care what, who you fuck...

Here's some tickets.
This is the 11 o'clock Seaboard tonight.

I don't care who you take with you
but you gotta be on that train.

Wait a minute! Wait a minute, gentlemen.
come on, a second here.

Look, if you don't do the whole thing...

I can bounce your head off the
floor like a fuckin' bowling ball...

...but let's just make it easy.

Put yourself on that train, Gary L...

Or we're gonna have to put you under it.

Listen, I think...can we...?

Oh, no...c'mon, fellas...gentlemen...
Let's just sit and visit with each other.

Is this...?

Mr. Cou...

<i>Francis Ormino found shot
Police seek witnesses</i>

When did you mark the bottles?
Frick are you talking about?

You been with me every
second since I been here...

...you see me mark any bottles?

No,
that's how come I know it was bullshit!

Mr. Suarez, nice to see you.

Let me introduce you to Joe Coughlin.

Pleasure to meet you, sir.

Have a drink.

Thank you very much.

I never agreed with the Spanish...

...that the lighter rums were superior.

Of course, we Cubans went along...

because or our obsession that
light is greater in all things.

Dion, Joseph! My sister, Graciela.
Nice to meet you.

We've met.
My mistake. Of course, we've met.

Yes, we have.

How you doin'?
Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

God, this rum is incredible!

It would be nice if
we could sell it up North.

When your country
treats you like adults.

Oh, I'd even be out of a job.

Esteban took those.

The working people of Miami. Very good!

It is a hobby. Perhaps I photograph
you someday, Mr. Coughlin?

I don't know about that. The fewer
pictures of me out there, the better.

I'm with the Indians on that one.

Speaking of captured souls...

I am told that Mr Gary L. Smith was
seen boarding a Seaboard Limited.

with his wife in one Pullman
and that puta maestra in the other.

Well, you never know.

Sometimes a change of scenery
can do a man good.

Is that why you're here in Ybor?
A little change of scenery?

I'm here in Ybor to distill and
distribute the demon rum.

A task which is made more difficult
by your erratic import schedules.

We don't control the tides.

The tides would be fine
if we were in Miami.

We know nothing of the boats to Miami.

Senor Famosa assures me
the tides have been calm all summer.

When you say Senor Famosa's name...

...so we worry you may
overtake our supply routes.

No, I use Senor Famosa's name...

...to reassure you that from now on,
you can work directly with me...

...and you can charge me a higher price.

What do we get in return?

You get access to Ormino's cops
and judges, which we now control.

Most of whom wouldn't do business
with you otherwise because you're Cuban.

And you would want
exclusive access to our molasses?

Nope. You just can't sell
to the White operation.

Albert White is a paying customer.

We've never had a problem with him.

I know Albert White.

I thought you might like to deal with
someone who treated you like a human being.

It is possible this
will bring bloodshed.

This will definitely bring bloodshed.

These are very favorable terms.

Albert White is what we get.

The local sheriff wanted to see us.

Apparently it was a custom down there...

...to talk about how
you were going to break the law...

...before you did it.

What kind of guy is the Chief?
Well, he's a cop, so he's an asshole.

Beyond that, he's ok.

What are you doing?
Don't fuck with the guy's stuff!

The Sheriff's gonna come in and find some
dago goin' through his fuckin' papers.

Hey, this is Vegas right here.

Please, sit down.

I won't insult you by...

...asking the nature of your business...

...so you won't have
to insult me by lying.

Is that fair?

Sounds fair to me.

Is it true you're a
police captain's son?

Yes, sir!

You serve overseas? France.

Tell it to the Marines.

Yes, sir. They told it to us.

I was a soldier and then a US Marshall.

I killed 7 men in my lifetime.

Truth be told,
their faces haunt me most nights.

You keep your business
north of Second...

...south of 27th and east of Nebraska.

You and I will have little
in the way of discord.

Sounds good.

I know we live in a fallen world...

...but just because I breathe corrupt air...

...rub elbows with corrupt men...

Never make the mistake of
thinking that I am corruptible.

I won't make that mistake.

Oh, I'm sorry. Thought you were alone.

That's alright, Loretta.
These gentlemen were just leaving.

Honey, your manners.

Oh, yes, Father.

Miss Loretta Figgis.

Pleased to meet you, Miss.
I'm Joe Coughlin.

Dion Bartolo. Loretta is taking
the train on a long journey today.

It's goin' around.

Is that right?

She gonna be a star in Hollywood.

It's only a screen test, Daddy.
No.

A screen agent came here
and picked out a few girls.

My brother's out there.
Your brother's in Hollywood?

He's a stuntman, I'm told.

Fallin' off horses.

Pleased to meet you, Miss. Chief.

Gentlemen.

You sure you don't want a banana?
No, it's alright.

You can't get fruit like this in Boston.
I know, it looks good.

Watch!
There she is.

Just watch this! Yeah?

Hello! Good afternoon! How are you?

I'm well. How are you?
Excellent!

You and your brother
come to any decision on...

Not yet. We're still considering,
Mr. Coughlin. Okay.

Yes, it would be quite an upheaval for us.

I understand. Of course.
We don't make changes easily.

Well, there's all kind of change.

Where I was recently staying,
we used to play chess a lot...

...this is the kind of change where you
get your pawn to the end of the board...

...and it changes into a queen.
There's not a lot to think about here.

Yes. I do play chess.
You do?

My father taught me.

What you might do well
to remember is that...

...the pawn and the king
end up in the same box...

...at the end of the game.

Man! It's not about the end.

It's about when you're playin' the game.

You hang me upside down
and light me on fire at the end.

I want to win while I'm playin'.

I have feeling you win
most of the games you play.

Not yet...but I plan on it.

Why don't you join me?

You know, some people say
that liquor is only a side business.

Is that so?

In fact, I heard rumors you
give most of your money away.

A lot of it in Cuba.

Anything that's foolish?

Not foolish,
Just not my cause, that's all.

What is your cause?

Distribution of Demon Rum.

And no man should rule
another man's life.

If you corner the rum market,
you will be a king.

I'll still have to deal
with Albert White.

But how will you hold the
power, once you have it?

Why, you don't think I'm strong enough?

I don't know if you're cruel enough.

And if you are, that would be very sad.

Powerful men don't have to be cruel.

But they usually are.

Tell me something, do you think there
is such a thing as an noble man?

I have nothing against noble men.
They just rarely live past 40.

My father died for Cuba.

My mother died of a broken heart.

He would often tell us,
Esteban and I...

"You can not truly live unless there
is something for which you would die."

Sounds like a good man.

He was.

We will never be lovers.
No?

Why's that?

We will not be lovers.

<i>We cornered the rum market
and lived like kings</i>

Fast. Come on. Hurry up.

<i>Banks collapsed. Jobs dried up.</i>

<i>But vice, it seemed,
was Depression-proof</i>

Okay. Let's go.

<i>The Suarez-Coughlin partnership
created a rare stability.</i>

<i>We paid off Albert's guys in Central
Florida to put down their guns.</i>

<i>So when Albert wanted to hit us
he had to use his Miami crews.</i>

<i>When they showed up,
we bushwhacked them.</i>

<i>Albert was living on the run in Miami...</i>

<i>and there wasn't a speak in Central
or North Florida we didn't sell to.</i>

Send them in there,
put this shit out. Alright.

Get on the floor!

Get down! Now!

Get on the floor!
Get down!

Get down! Get Down!

This is what happens when
Catholics try to sell liquor down here.

The guy's name is R.D. Pruitt.

Well, we better go find him.

He is in the Clan.
So what?

So are 5 million other guys in this country.
The clan has a lot of fuckin' juice.

They're inbreds with
4th grade educations.

Oh. They're gonna love you.

A Catholic who works with coloreds
and lives with the Cubans.

The bigger problem is
R.D.'s brother-in-law.

Who'ss he?
Chief Figgis.

Joe Coughlin.

I don't shake hands with Papists.

No offense.

None taken.

It help if I tell you I haven't
been to church in half of my life?

Alright, now.

R.D.

Word is your causin'
trouble down in Ybor.

How's that?

Well, we hear you're stickin' up places.

I don't know a damn thing about that.

I'm just playing with you.

You all know that.

R.D.

This is a businessman
who's come here to business...

...and I suggest that
you do it with him.

This man is a bootlegger...

...and a fornicator with niggers.

He needs to be tarred and feathered,
not done business with.

I'm just playin'!
You can take a joke, right?

Sure, I can take a joke.

Not if you become one, right?

So you like the Parisian, right?

And if I did?

I might be able to cut you in
on 10% of the house take.

You'd do that?
I would.

Well, I ought to be worth more than 10%.

What were you thinking?

I was thinking 60.
60 percent?

The biggest club in town?

That's right.
For what exactly?

My friends might look
on you more kindly.

What friends?
50%.

Son, I ain't giving you 60%.
I ain't your son.

Ain't nobody's son.

Save you father some embarrassment.

What's that?
15%.

I will beat you to death.
Excuse me?

You know...

...that does sound like
a fair arrangment.

You go to 20?
I think 15's pretty good...

...for a job you won't
have to show up to work for.

Well, it's a fair deal...

...and I'm pleased to agree to it.

How to I pick up my cut?
Come by the Parisian...

...second Tuesday, every month. 7 o'clock.

Pleasure, Mr. Coughlin.

Irv.

Sounds like we have a deal.

The boy's as dumb as a grape.

I don't understand what Maso wants.

Arrests are down 70%,
revenues up 300%.

I don't like it...some kid sent
down here like we need supervision.

No, no. We don't need supervision.

Digger want to look at the
Casino option, check progress...

...that's all. He's gonna
report back to the old man.

Hey, Joe, don't make a big thing of it.

Maso still gonna listen to what his son
tells him about startin' a new casino.

Don't worry about it.

How'd he get the name Digger?
Because he's a fuckin' dummy.

All they let him do is dig ditches
for the bodies they bump off.

No shit! Yeah!

That's great.

<i>I had come up with a plan to invest in a
casino with stakeholders in Sarasota...</i>

<i>...at the new Ritz development site.</i>

Ritz Hotel and Casino.

Top shelf.
Right to the casino.

Absolute top level resort.

Sure to be a good experience
whether you gamble or not.

<i>For such a violent business it was
populated with surprising number of guys...</i>

<i>...who were just puttin'
food on the table.</i>

<i>Digger wasn't one of those guys.</i>

So this is it.

Volstead Act won't last forever, right?

What we gonna do when Prohibition ends?

Gambling.

We use the connections we put
together to get it legalized...

...and we're the only ones
in place to run it.

And this is it?

Will be. Ritz Longboat Key.

I sat down with the
owners of Sarasota last week.

Why'd they let us in?
Because the can't get gambling legal...

...and they can't run a casino.

The own the property, we run the casino.
We chop the profits 50/50.

Wait a minute.

Do we have a magic
stick for changin' laws?

I heard you got bingo legal.

It's a step. It's like a prerequisite,
you gotta do one thing and then...

Yeah, I know...a prerequisite.

Your grandmother can
come down, so plan the church.

Bingo.

Look, I got bag men to buy inspectors
in Talahassee and Sarasota.

I got guys going after Senators
and IRS agents who gamble.

We can gamble legal. We are rich. Legit.

For the long fuckin' haul!

I talk a good game too...

...but I like you.

He's very smart boy.

Maso went crazy for the casino.

He called every day for updates,
like it was his idea.

It was addressed to
"Sir Joseph Coughlin, Niggerfucker."

Inside was a two word note.

"Sixty percent."

Same note. Same message.

We are doing everything we can,
but he's protected.

His roots here are too deep.

Well, time to start diggin'.

Good afternoon, gentlemen.

Virgil Beauregard.
What can I do for you today?

We're hopin' you can
talk some sense into RD Pruitt.

Ain't too many people ever
had much success doing that.

We'd like you to try.

And what would the reason be?
His self-preservation.

He needs to stop
shootin' up my clubs.

Clubs?

What kind of clubs?

Great clubs?

Because I belong to the Greater
Tampa Rotary Club myself...

...and I don't recall ever seein' you.

I come here to do piece of business with
you and you wanna play fuckin' games?

Is that what I wanna do?

Look, you're the Grand Wizard
of the Ku Klux Klan around here...

...congratulations...

...but do you think that
we got where we are...

...by lettin' some inbred shitpickers
muscle us?

If that's who you think we are,
you're makin' a fatal miscalculation, son.

We're clerks, and bankers...

police officers and deputies...

...hell, we even got a judge.

And if you're dumb
enough to fight us...

...we're gonna rain bloody hellfire
down on you and all you love.

So you're threatening me with
people who are more powerful than you?

Exactly.

What the fuck am I talkin' to you for?

You've come to my home.

Thought I'd save you the
trouble of haulin' me in.

75 witnesses.
Not a one who'll come forward.

You want a beer?

It's near-beer. But it ain't bad
Love one.

Thanks.

I need R.D., Chief.

I expect you feel that way.

You know what happens
if you don't help me.

No, I don't.

More bodies are gonna pile up.

More articles like "Cigar City Slaughter"
are gonna get written...

...and the Chief's gonna get pushed out.

You too.
Maybe.

Difference is...
when you get pushed out...

...someone does it with a
bullet to the back of your ear.

I'm not sellin' out my wife's brother.

I don't wanna to do this.
Do What?

I don't wanna do what you're makin' me do.
I'm not makin' you do anything.

Yeah, you are.

What?
She didn't make it to Hollywood.

She just made it to Los Angeles.

That's not right.

We got her with a special doctor now.
She's alright.

What kind of doctor?

The kind that
gets people off heroin, Irv.

You do not ever call me
by my Christian name.

You will call me Chief Figgis...

...for whatever years or days
remain in our acquaintance.

Are we clear?
I didn't do this to her.

You just name your price for telling me
where my daughter is.

She's in a clean, safe facility and I'm not
gonna tell you where she is, until we...

Until?

R.D., you are going to
meet with this boy again...

...and that's the end of the
discussion on the matter.

Yes, it'll just be the two of us.

Longboat Key...

...by the Ritz. Tonight at ten.

When do I get her location?

As soon as I get out
of this meeting alive.

You do it yourself.

What's that?

If you're going to kill him,
be man enough to pull the trigger.

Ain't no pride in having other people
do what you're too weak to do yourself.

In my experience doesn't
take much to pull the trigger.

Where is my brother-in-law?

He didn't come.

Boys, this one here is rat-tricky.

Take your eyes off that pea shooter,
I promise it will be in his hands.

Not likely.

You a man of your word?

Depends on who I give it to.

So you ain't come alone like I ordered?

Shit, R.D., that would spoil the fun.

Where they at?

You know, this could be the
biggest casino in the United States...

...when they end Prohibition.
They ain't gonna end Prohibition...

... in a God fearing country.

Country's in the tank.

Banks going under,
the cities are bankrupt.

Cause we got a communist president.

Because we're not taxing liquor.

And that's why this state's gonna
change it's laws to legalize gambling.

And you could be part of that.
I don't wanna be a part of nothin' with you.

How much is he paying you?

Who?
Albert White.

How much is he payin' you
to shoot up my speaks?

You're doin' a hell of a job for him.

Yeah, I took his Catholic money.

You know why?

Cause I'd have done it for free.

You are a pestilence.

You and your nigger whore girlfriend
and your dirty dago friends.

I'm a take the Parisian.

Not 60%, the whole thing.

I'm a take all your clubs.

I'm a take everything you got.

Might even go by your house...

...tear off a piece of that nigger
girl before I cut her throat.

You ain't got this yet
but you leavin' town, boy.

You just forgot your pack your bags.

Alright.

Go ahead.

Bring the car around.

Alright, we'll get you to a doctor.

It hurts.

Hurts but it's not gonna kill you.

Ah, fuck! We should've never
showed him the pictures.

What pictures?
Figgis.

What we had to do to put
this fuckin' guy down.

Price was too high.

I think it was you who shot me.
What?

I got him before he got a shot off.
It wasn't me who shot you.

It couldn't have been nobody else.
Fasini was back there.

It was Fasini who fuckin' shot you.
No, Fasini was coming from back there.

Yeah, Fasini came over here. He came on
this angle, like this, right here.

Yeah, I was over here.
I got these motherfuckers.

You hit me!

Ah, just get the fucking car.

It's gonna be a great casino.

Right? Yeah!

Albert had been paying R.D.
on his own to come after us.

But once we killed
members of the Klan...

the Klan took it personal.

They came to finish me off at the hospital,
but we had guards posted at the doors.

When the Klansmen gave up and went home,
Dion had them followed.

The subsequent string of beatings,
bombings and murders...

...effectively put an end to the
power of the KKK in Tampa.

How do you feel?
Alright.

You?

Good.

Irv's wife moved out and
took their son with her.

No one saw Loretta for the whole season.

Can I take your name?

You wanna get married?

We are married, aren't we?

Graciela Isabella...

I can't remember them all.
Lunes, Martes...

I don't have that many names.
Wait, wait, wait,wait

Graciela Coughlin.

Best thing ever happened to that name.
Of yours? Yes.

I bought buildings.

Wow, we're married and just like that,
now you bought some buildings?

Yes, I bought three buildings
by the Perez factory.

What are you going to
do with these buildings?

I want to give shelter to
abandoned women and children.

It's important, Joe.

What happened to
Cuban politics for a cause?

I fell in love with you.

You restrict my mobility.

Come here.

I love you.

After months of seclusion...

Loretta emerged from home and declared
that she would only wear white...

...a decision made for
her by Jesus Christ...

...to whom she would now be wed.

Her show was a hit...

...and her vision of Tampa,
cleansed off sin,

didn't include a casino.

What's the problem with this preacher?

There's no problem with the preacher.
Everything's gonna work out fine.

Nothing can jeopardize our casino deal.

Absolutely, Maso. 100%.
Do what you need to.

Look, I'm gonna go down there,
I'm gonna talk to her and...

What needs to be done, will get done.
Okay?

Just make sure the problem goes away.
I don't want to hear about it.

Alright. Thanks a lot.

You don't need to listen in on me.

Ask me anything you want
about my business, I'll tell you.

It's your business, not mine.

But I will. Anything you wanna know.

I came down here it was all about
gettin' revenge, makin' money...

...now everything I do, every step I take

...is about you and me and
protecting our future...

...and that's what you
need to understand.

But if those steps make you,
little by little, someone else...

...then you will
not be you anymore.

You're you, except for
all those bad things you did.

You're almost you.

I want the real you.

You have me. Come here.

You have me.

Gambling destroys the spirit.

She's right.
Amen.

One hears much of personal liberty...

...but when you've seen
the barbarity of man...

...and been treated to personal doses.

You see..It is simply
the liberty for gambler.

For the gambler to fritter
away the gifts of God...

...using it for himself.
Amen.

Personal liberty is the liberty...

...of a murderer...

...a seducer...

...a wolf who wants to
remain in a sheep fold.

I ask you...

How cheap is your virtue?

No! Not cheap.
Not cheap.

How cheap is your virtue?
It's not cheap!

My virtue's always been pretty cheap.
What virtue?

And they seek to build a house
of gambling on our waterfront.

When we act, we act!

God bless you.

I'm afraid there's only
one way to deal with it.

With her around the
casino gets voted down.

The casino gets voted down,
me and you are on the hook for it.

I'll handle it. Okay?

Mr. Coughlin!
Ms. Figgis, such a pleasure!

Thanks so much for seeing us.
It was a great show today.

Great! Terrific!

You know my father...
Ah, Chief.

..and this is Mayweather.

Mayweather is taking the good
word and preaching it down south.

It's a pleasure, sir.
My pleasure. That's good.

They need to hear about this in Miami.
Keep up the good work.

I'll try, sir.

What can I do for you?

I was hoping I could just have
a word with you for a second.

I was hoping to talk to you
a little bit about the Ritz.

My father says there once
was a good man in you.

I wasn't aware he departed.

You do quite a lot for the people here.

But we both know, your good works
are mitigated by your evil deeds.

We do?

You profit from the illegal
addictions of others...

...their weakness and sloth
and libidinous behavior...

...but you can free yourself of that.

And I don't want to.

Of course you do.

Miss Figgis, you're a lovely woman...

...and your story is amazing.

I'm not surprised the flock's
up threefold since you started here.

More like 5 times.

More booze has been drunk
in the last 10 years than ever before...

...because people don't
wanna be told they can't do it.

The same could be said of fornication.

People want it, but don't
wanna be told they can't have it.

Why should they?

I'm sorry?

If people want to fornicate,
I see no reason to stop them.

And if they wish to lie down with animals?
Do they?

I'm sorry?

Do people wish to lie down with animals?
Some do.

And their sickness will spread
if you have your way.

Forgive me. I see no correlation between
alcohol and lyin' down with animals.

There's a correlation across all sin.

It's all against the wishes of God,
therefore all equally offensive.

Let me apologize. I think we
got off on the wrong foot here.

I'm just here to ask you if
you would be amenable...

to omitting the Casino issue
from your sermons...

...and in exchange,
we're gonna bring a business here.

Business will create jobs...

...which will reduce the
sinfulness that comes with...

...poverty and idle hands.

We'd be willing to
contribute to the church.

No, we'd be willing to
build a few churches.

If God rewrites the Bible to
cast gambling as virtuous...

...I will refrain from
speaking against it.

But until then, we don't get to
pick our sins, Mr. Coughlin.

I can't do it.

What? It's gonna fuck up the whole deal.
What do you mean, you can't do it?

I know. No one touches her.

That's a mistake.

No shit.

Can we get you anything?
No, we're ok, thanks.

We know you men are busy and
we don't want to waste your time.

We are not going to invest
in the casino at the Ritz.

Are you... sure about that?
I'm afraid so.

The publicity is too much.

One woman preachin' in a fuckin' tent?

Yes, because the casino would
represent only 2% of our total holdings...

...and we can't appear to be a
company of Irish and Italian Catholics...

...turning white
Protestant girls into drug addicts.

People I work for are gonna
be very upset about this.

We aren't men to be muscled or conned.

We are an institution.
We can't be bribed or bullied...

...because I simply represent the
vested interest of a board of governors.

We are the landed, white
gentry in this country...

...and we have no plans to
carve off a strip of this country...

...which we have gone to
great pains to break and colonize...

...and hand it over to Catholics,
Jews, darkies or dagos.

It's just a bigger, better racket,
that's all...

...keepin' the money in your hands
and out of the hands of people like us.

All those people...

...the Negro, on whose back you went
to great pains to break this country...

...and the immigrants who
came over here with nothin'...

...and worked their fingers
to the fuckin' bone...

...all believed it when you told
them they could get ahead...

...and one day, and I may not live
to see it, they're gonna figure it out.

But I tell you what,
I'd hate to fuckin' be you.

Standin' between those people
and what they deserve.

Good luck to you, prick!

Would have been a hell of a casino.

You'll get another chance.
Things swing back around.

Not all things.

They announced it on the radio,
just when we got back.

President-Elect Roosevelt promised
to sign the Cullen-Harrison Act...

...the minute he was elected,
effectively ending Prohibition.

Hello, Ms. Figgis!
Mr. Coughlin.

May I? Yeah.
Just for a minute? Please sit.

You're lookin' very well.

I see, you're not wearin' white.

It's almost white.

Would you like a menu?
Thank you very much.

Can I get a cup of coffee, please?

Thank you.

Why does my father hate you so much?

I'm a crook. He's the Chief of Police.

That's how it goes, I guess.

No, he liked you.
He said you were the mayor of Ybor.

Is that what he said?
Mm-hmm.

What did you do...

...to him?

We had photographs.

And you showed them to him.

I showed him two.

How many did you have?

All of them.

We're all going to hell.

I don't think you're going to hell.

You know what I learned...

...as I've been thrusting
my soul out to God?

What?

This is heaven...right here.

We're in it now.

Then how come it looks like hell?

Because we fucked it all up.

After my trials...

...I slept in the bed of my childhood.

I felt certain again.

I missed that.

I don't know if there is a God...

...but I hope there is...

...and I hope he's kind.

Wouldn't that be swell?

Yes, it would be.

You seem not to despair.
Do you have a secret?

No, no secrets.

I have my wife. That's enough.

But what if you lose her?

What are you going to do now?

What do you mean?
You stopped me, stopped the casino...

...law couldn't do it...

...the people couldn't do it.
The Klan couldn't do it. You did it.

I didn't get rid of alchohol.
No, that was too big.

But you stopped gambling and before
you came along it was a lock.

I did do that, didn't I?
Yes, you did.

What's your father gonna do?

Sit in his chair, I guess...

...blind with rage that...

...men touched his daughter
the way he used to touch his wife...

...and worse.

He goes around the house
whispering one word over and over.

What word?

Repent.

Repent, repent.

Give him some time.
Maybe he'll come out of it.

We heard from Boston.
All three trucks made it up there fine.

Same payoffs as last week.
So, there's no problem.

Very good.

And Loretta Figgis cut
her own throat yesterday.

What?

Yeah, she did it at home
in the Chief's bed, they say.

You gotta give it to her...

...she's got moxie!
I couldn't do that.

You know, I guess
some things are meant to be.

She could have done it 3 months earlier
and done us all a fuckin' favor.

Well, too late.

<i>Death of a Madonna</i>
You blame yourself?

She went out West as
so many other girls do...

...and she was preyed upon.

Not by you.

Well, by men like me...

...to get the booze,
to get the girls, get the drugs...

...one hand washes the other.

You don't need it, mi amigo,
We are not our brother's keeper.

In fact it is an insult to
our brother to believe we are.

Look at these people.

If this man dies of, say drunkenness...

...is it our fault?

When did you take this picture?

A month ago.

Are you sure?

I took this picture myself.
A month and three days ago. Why?

Because that woman died in 1927.

There's never been
anyone like you in my life.

One day I'm going to
be good enough for you.

You sure it's her?
You tell me.

You told Graciela?
Of course I told her.

Jesus Christ.

What you wouldn't tell your woman?

No, I don't tell them shit
but you're more of a nance than me.

What'd you say?
Look, sorry, hon...

...that girl I was bent out of shape
over for years...

...she's not dead. She's in Miami.

Don't make a big
fuckin' thing out of it.

When you go home?

Going where?
What do you mean where?

You found out this girl you used
to be bugs for is 200 miles away.

When you goin'?

I'm goin' to go after this thing with Maso.
Good. Give you something to live for.

What does that mean?

Him and his guys are takin' over
half the train to get down here.

That's a big fucking entourage!

Ah, bullshit,
I ain't worried about it.

There's no percentage in killin' us.

We do $ 11.5 million a year from
rum alone in this fuckin' cop town.

What's he gonna kill us for?

All we do is send him bags of money
up to his mansion in fuckin' Mahatts.

I don't like the signs.
What fuckin' signs?

We lost the casino,
we never moved our narcotics...

...and you're a Irish in a world where there
ain't much of a shortage in guineas.

Ok, you're walkin' into a building
where he bought up every room.

I can't hide a weapon. Nothin'.
You're going in blind and we'll be outside.

Is that enough signs for you?

I need you to do something for me.

I need you to go stay in
Miami for just a little while.

How long is "a little while"?

I don't know. Not too long.

I'm not gonna have your address.
I want you give it to Dion.

When the time comes, he'll tell me
where you are and I'll come get you.

So you can find out if you are
as cruel as you need to be?

I guess so.

Joseph.

Even if you win today's battle, there
is so much violence in what you do.

I know.

Gino, where you livin' now?
In Quonsett. Settlin' down?

Two kids, hanquera, casa, whole thing.

Got any?
Not for me.

There is never a right time.

This way.

How are you, my son?

Fine.

Fausto, see if Dion needs anything.
Please, come in.

So, how've you been?
Good. You?

More good days than bad.
Right.

This is the filly who fucked
up the whole casino thing?

Yeah, that's her.

Why didn't you clip her then?

Too much blowback.
That's not it.

You're not a killer, Joseph.

You are a bandit in a suit.

That's why you didn't kill that
"puttana pazza."

You know how much money this
place was doing when I got here?

You know what it's doing it now?
But that's all rum.

You neglected the girls
and the narcotics.

I went after the rum because
it was the most profitable...

...and I added four houses in my time here

Yeah, but you could've added more.

Maso, Look...
Mr. Pescatore!

I ran Ybor. I ran Tampa.

Do you ever have a problem?
You did more than that.

You ran the whole coast.

You boxed out Albert, put him
in a little piss corner of Miami.

I've been through the books.

You made as a force down here.

And now, what? No Irish need apply?
What can I be?

What I fuckin' tell you to be...

...before you get
a fuckin' pop in the mouth!

Mick!

You can be conciliere.

You teach Digger the ropes,
meet people...

...teach him to fish...

...but you need to take a haircut.

What kind of a haircut?

Digger gets your take.

Look, Mr. Pescatore.

I think it's a fabulous idea.

Digger comes down here, takes over.

We'll run Florida. We'll take over Cuba.

But my take's gotta stay
somewhere near where it is.

And there's no power in being crew boss
and shakin' down longshoremen.

You ever think, maybe,
that's the point, smart guy?

You need me. I built this.

We could use you.

But I'm sensing a lack of gratitude.
So am I.

You work for me, not the spics
or the niggers you hang out with.

If I tell you to clean the shit out
of my toilet, guess what you do?

I can kill your cunt girlfriend and burn
your house to ambers, if I feel like it.

So, do want to be crew boss or
clean the shit out of my toilet?

I'm accepting applications for both.

I guess it's crew boss.

That's my boy!

You want dinner tonight,
we have a few nice spots set aside.

You know, Joseph, what
I like about Albert White?

What?

Is that he knows Tampa too.
Which means nobody needs you, dumb fuck.

My fortune's have changed a little bit.

Me and Maso, we patched things over.

Turns out when you blew the casino deal,
He looked to me to help his son...

...and that was just the start.

You see...

...you need to trust
the people you work with.

We don't get into this
game to play second...

...to back the wrong horse.

That's it.

You thought you'd be eatin' tomorrow,
lookin' at the fuckin' sun...

...well, think again.

Take your last look because you die now.
Wait.

Albert, I have something
you want to see.

Something that if you don't see,
you'll regret your whole life.

You'd never forgive yourself.

She's dead.
She look dead to you?

Where is she?
She's in the fucking picture, Albert.

Where is she?

I'd love to tell you.
I'd love to walk out of here more.

That's an old one.
You just folded up an old one.

That's what I thought too.

Look at the guy in the
corner with the newspaper.

That was last month.

So you tell me or
I'll put you in the fuckin' ground.

I loved her too, Albert.
Like you love that woman? Yeah.

Is she a nigger or a spic? She's both.

Where the fuck are they?

Why don't you ask Albert,
he knows Tampa.

Do you know why all
the molasses and rum...

...that comes into Florida
comes through Tampa, Maso?

The tunnels. What tunnels?

The ones runnin' under
this neighborhood.

That's how they get the booze in.

That's where my men are right now.

Your guys are all standin' around
guardin' the front door...

...but that ain't where we're comin'.

We're comin' for you, Maso...

...but we're comin' from below.

You cleared the room?

Everything, the whole floor.

Seppe, give it another look.

Boss, they spotted Coughlin downstairs.
He even get a scratch?

A cut on the head.

I don't suppose you can wait
for him to die of blood poison.

Maro,
I don't think we got that kind of time.

It's a hard thing for a man
to have a son this stupid.

All clear, Boss.

I want you to cover
the door and the stairs...

...like Roman fucking centurions.

Pour me one, will you?

Where were you hiding? Hiding?

When Seppe cleared the room.
I was sittin' right here.

I asked him if he wanted to work
for someone who'd be alive tomorrow.

That's what it took?

And you wanted to put a fuckin'
dunce like Digger in charge!

You had a good thing goin' here
and you fucked it all up in one day.

You know how many people died here...

...because of your simple wop bullshit.

Maybe someday you'll have a son
and you'll understand.

Oh, I understand.

How is my son? Your son is dead now.

He would have killed
every last one of us.

Hunted us down, you know that.

They didn't expect to see old age.

Neither do I.

I had this whole thing I was
going to say to Albert before I go.

Too late.

Alright, I don't want to see
anyone else get killed today.

Any of you guys want to die?

No, Mr. Coughlin.

Whoever wants to go back up
to Boston has my blessing, go ahead.

If any of you want to stay down here
where the sun is warm...

...and the girls are pretty,
we got jobs for you.

But I'm finished.

If you want the boss, go to him.

He runs things now.

Any confusion on that?

Good.

Graciela.

Let's go. Clean up this fuckin' mess.

Dion ran the crew for eight years
and he was right.

He didn't see old age.

Say what you have to say.

So what?

You had the racket. You just
thought you'd make the best of it?

No. Then what?

What happened, Emma?

Well, once the coppers started
chasin' me, I said to the driver...

...the only way to get away was
to drive off the bridge but...

...but he wouldn't listen. So?

So I shot him..

We went into the water. I swam out.

Ran to the nearest
house with a light on.

He was a fisherman.
Oh, he was happy to take me in.

You didn't want to reach me?

If I put my head up,
they would have killed me.

I didn't owe you.

I mourned for you for years.

Why don't you tell me how bad
I'm supposed to feel for you?

Well, maybe if I had a Police Chief
father from a nice part of Ireland...

...but I just had to make do.

Did you ever love me?

We had a laugh, Joe.

Oh, sure there were moments but do
you have to make it something it wasn't.

Which was what?

A lie.

You know we're not God's children.

We're not fairy tale people
in a true love book.

We dance like motherfuckers so
the grass can't grow underfoot.

I'm free, Joseph.

If you want to come by now,
you've got an open invitation.

We always had a lot of laughs.

I don't wanna be free.

Ah, come on!

That's all we ever wanted.

That's what you wanted
and now you got it.

Goodbye, Emma.

We built Graciela's casitas for
abandoned women and children...

...who needed a place to stay.

We named our son after my father.

He was thoughtful,
kind, like his mother.

Repent!

Repent!Repentance.

Repent!

Repent!

Is that for me? Come here, sweetheart.
Come to your papa.

Repent!

Tomas. Repent!

Repent!

Repent!

Repent!

Are you alright?

Oh, no!

Oh, no!

Oh, no!

Oh, no!

Oh, God, no!

On Saturdays,
I take my son to the shows.

Hi, two for...

Thank you.

Some little German guy's makin'
trouble overseas.

I don't believe they'll
fight another war, though.

No percentage in.

My son loved the show.

It was about an honest
sheriff in a dirty town.

All he could talk about was gettin'
his own badge when he grew up.

That's my brother. Huh!

That was my brother's name.

That's your uncle.

In the afternoons,
we fish for redfin and snook.

One day, my son asked me
"Where is heaven in the sky?"

And I told him what Loretta told me.

"This is heaven, right here."

"We're in it now."
