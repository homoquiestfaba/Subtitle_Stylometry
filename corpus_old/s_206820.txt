ln July 1937

Japan started
the Marco Polo Bridge lncident

Beijing and Tianjin fell
one after another. Huabei was in danger

The Chinese nation's existence
was at stake

For the whole nation's interests

CPC joined hands with KMT once again

Red Army was recomposed into
KMT's 8th Route Army

Following the order of

CPC's Central Military Commission

l crossed the Yellow River
and rushed day and night

for the frontline against Japan

Between Henan and Hebei
is the Yellow River

while between Shandong and Shanxi
is Mt. Taihang

After we marched through Shanhaiguan
from Manchuria

the vast North China Plain
is right in front of us

As the Chinese saying goes

He who has conquered Taihang
will be invincible

Shanxi is right between
Mt. Taihang and the Yellow River

The goal for this army is to

capture northern China via Shanxi

How come the area and shape of Shanxi

are so much like those of Japan?

lt is more like the spine of China

Seizing Taihang is like
breaking the back of the Chinese

Chiang calls for
'resistance by burning the land'

Yours must be more meaningful

lf the land is burnt
what is there to fight for?

Defending the land is our main goal

Resistance is just
a way of achieving the goal

Excellent...

Sir, Zhu De is here

My uniform

My friend

Your Excellency Commander Yan

Zhu De is here to report for duty

By no means...

Please...

Please...

As your Party's declaration said

the whole Chinese nation
is being endangered

We've been anxiously
waiting for your coming

l'm sorry to say that
we're poorly equipped

We may not be of much help
to the war situation

Help yourself...

Get tea ready

But all my soldiers
vow to fight together with you

Resistance by defending the land

l hereby officially confirm to you that

CPC has made the resolution to

launch a campaign against the Japanese

Please give your comment

Pingxingguan is ideal for
setting an ambush

lt's the only route for
ltagaki troops to enter Shanxi

lt's the chance of a lifetime

l wonder how many of you
have got here in Shanxi?

The CPC and Mao Zedong are aware that

the Japanese army
is bearing down upon here

and ordered us to rush here

even before the recomposition
is finalized

Lin Biao's 1 15th and
He Long's 120th Divisions

are at the frontline now

Liu Bocheng's 129th Division
is on its way there

Together with HQs led by Peng Dehuai

we've got 32000 men here

Sir, tea is ready

Please Please...

Lin Biao, He Long, Liu Bocheng

Peng Dehuai and you

All the five red tigers are here

Shanxi is honored, so is 2nd Theater
and me myself too

We're flattered

But we really need your troops to

help Lin Biao
intercepting fleeing enemies

Look out!

Sure...

lt's really good

for setting an ambush here

Will they really pass through here?

Absolutely

They've got so many supplies and gear

They can't possibly fly over here

We 1 15th Division is put in charge

This is the first campaign
of our 8th Route Army

How should we beat them?

We must build up confidence

What if KMT troops don't cooperate?

We need their cooperation

But we can't count on them

We have to fight, even without them

Sir, here they are

lt is an ideal place for an ambush

But l wonder if you have
sufficient men and power

One enemy regiment overruns
one of our army groups

Your 1 15th Division is poorly equipped
How can you fight?

l personally appreciate your courage

Human factor is more important

lt's going to rain

What if you can't get there on time?

The main issue is
whether we can count on

your efficient support and cooperation

Please rest assured

l've mobilized my reserves

We'll attack the Japs from the north

to help you pinning them down

That... will be wonderful

Sir, HQ orders us to speed up

Captain Yes, sir!

Your company stays for rescue

Yes, sir! Follow me, men!

Stand up. Go!

Doc!

Stop...

Sir

we met resistance from the Chinese ahead

Get rid of them

Yes, sir

Charge!

Charge!

Fire!

Sir

we've smashed a team of KMT army

March on

1 15th Division
is heading towards the location

Any ltagaki scouts are seen over there?

No, they are marching in a queue

No scouting or covering forces

The Japanese are still blindly arrogant

lt shows our timing is good

We've got to be cautious

Ask Lin Biao

to control the heights in the valley

and make sure our flanks are secured

02... come in

02, this is 01 , come in

02... this is 01 , come in

02... come in

02... come in

02... this is 01 , come in

02... this is 01 , come in

Get away!

Get away

The Japanese has got into our ambush

Their vanguard
has walked out of the valley

Their supply vehicles
are all within the range

Go!

lt's up there

Sergeant...

Chinese army ambushing us? lmpossible!

They must be guerrillas. Wipe them out

Yan Xishan?

l know him the best

He is my
lmperial Military School classmate

He doesn't have the guts

Shall we ask for help
from our air forces?

No need

Sir, do please give it a thought

Ok, then

The enemy's bombing is fierce

Get our men down there to mix them up

Charge...!

The Japanese is taking Laoyemiao

That's a height

Tell Li Tianyou he mustn't lose it

Colonel!

Captain, reinforce the height

Go! Yes, sir!

Sir, Gao Guizi, Commander of 1 7th Army

ordered his men
to abandon their positions

Lin Biao's troops are still fighting

Their flanks are exposed
lt's too dangerous

What's to be done?

He isn't under my control

Shall we get our 71st Division to attack?

so as to cover Lin Biao's men?

ltagaki's reinforcement
is coming from the north

Yan's troops don't do anything

1 15th Division's flank is totally exposed

Lin Biao is prepared for that

He's deployed troops along Yimaling

to check their reinforcements

Ask him to finish the fight
and get out of there

Get the horses!

To Pingxingguan

We've got no ammunition

Neither do l

Let's go!

Charge bayonets!

Remove bullets

Charge!

Charge!

Charge!

What...?

Bayonet charge?

Who the hell are they?

They must be 8th Route Army

101 ... come in, 101

lt's their 1 1th charge now

We have to fight with bayonets

Hold it at all costs!

Give up! No harm!

Give up! No harm!

Give up! No harm...!

Get out of here

Come here, he's still alive

Coming

Make sure to keep him alive

No!

Attention!

At ease!

At ease!

Today, September 25, 1937

is a day that astonished the whole world

that will be recorded
into the history of China

Because we defeated
the most ferocious enemy

the ltagaki's troops

Who is this ltagaki?

He is one of the plotters
behind 9.18 lncident

He also made the last Qing emperor Puyi

emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo

Down with ltagaki!
Down with Japanese lmperialism...!

You defeated the scoundrel today

This is the most severe setback

for the Japanese invaders since 1937

To date back further
it's their most severe setback

ever since
the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894

Your confidence and braveness

crushed the myth of
Japanese imperial army

Your willpower of iron
and spirit of sacrifice

declared to the world

the Chinese people and nation

can never be conquered

Long live the Chinese nation!

Long live the Chinese nation...

Long live the Chinese nation!

Long live 8th Route Army!

Another compliment

lt's a pity l can't take the credit

Now 8th Route Army stands firm in Shanxi

Commander-in-chief...

Comrade Rongzhen

Look

This is a Japanese military map

This is where we are, Nanru Village

But Yan's map is too simple
to mark the village

This map of China drawn by the Japanese

is more detailed and accurate

lt shows their conspiracy
existed long long ago

How is the result of the campaign?

Over 1000 enemy soldiers were killed

Our casualty is about the same

We've never had such kind of a fight

They're really tough

They were brain-washed by militarism

Any POWs?

We've checked it out, no POWs

Not a single one? No

Ren, can l interview Zhu De now?

l'm afraid not

Comrade Zhu De is now
in command of the battle

So he has no time for the time being

He never has time, always busy

When ever will l finish the biography?

Commander-in-chief
in common people's eyes

lt can best show
the truth of our people's army

Ren, you're really a politician

At such a critical moment

you two agreed to be

vice commanders of my 2nd Theater

l really appreciate your support

The fate of this nation is at stake
l have to

Mr. Chiang is afraid that the Japanese

would go all the way
to Sichuan through Shanxi

and outflank from the southwest
to take China

So the Xinkou Campaign is vital

lt can never be underestimated

We wish we could be of some help to you

Please... Please

Since we are Chinese armies

and we're all anti-Japanese

we should break away with the systems

and set up a united anti-Japan force
to fight together

Our armies will be mixed
into three routes

The east route will be headed by Zhu De

The middle route by Lihuang

And l'll take care of the west route

What do you think?

Ok, all forces of Central Army
along the east route

will also be given to Zhu De

lt applies to my Shanxi Army too

You two can take our men
on the middle and west routes

There's no problem with that

l only hope you can see

if there is anything good
about 8th Route Army

it is that flexible as we are

we can start guerrilla warfare
behind enemies

lt is also our fighting principle

and has been endorsed
by the Generalissimo

Of course...

The treasure of Jinci is not the temple

lt's the three fountains

lt's rather peculiar

Wherever originated
they are merged here

irrigating the vast farmland
in central Shanxi

So even three waters in Shanxi are united

Yes, united

To fight against the Japs

Damned! Dare you come down here?

ls that Liu Bocheng?

Judging from the taking off frequency

there must be a Japanese airbase here

Find it and blow it up

Very good!

We don't know
how to deal with air bombings

Chen Xilian blew up their entire airbase

120th Division led by He Long

also had a marvelous ambush at Yanmenguan

and cut off the enemy's supply

Wei Lihuang will have
an easier time guarding Xinkou

Dare you come up here?

Where are your planes?

Are they hatching now?

Chairman Mao believes
the recovery victory is temporary

Taiyuan will be lost soon

Our army's principle
is still the guerilla warfare

Yan and Chiang have the same idea

Both want to stick to Taiyuan
and ask us for help

Chiang's passive recovery
will fail for sure

But Yan's still fighting against the Japs

we must help him

Here is my idea

Our main force will attack the Japs' rear

to support KMT's recovery efforts

As Chairman Mao said
we'll also set up four bases

in northeastern, southeastern

southwestern and
the border area of Shanxi

Some family members
of most of these women

have died at the front

And their Save-the-nation
Committee organizes

the villagers to make shoes
for the Red Army soldiers

Which kind of flower is it?

They are lotus flowers

But there is only one usually
how come there is two?

She said there should be only one flower

instead of two

They are twin-lotus-flowers

ln the Chinese folk culture

the twin-lotus-flowers
are a symbol of love

Of love?

She made the pads

for her husband

But he's gone to the front

only 3 days after their wedding

Did he go willingly or was he forced to?

Did he go willingly or was he forced to?

l took him there myself

He himself demanded to go to the front

lt's no wonder

All his family except himself
were killed by the Japs

Our victory at Pingxingguan
crushed invaders' morale

and stimulated that of all the Chinese

The Resistance movement's
spreading across the country

Japan sent even more
armed forces to China

to attack Taiyuan
a strategic city in North China

At Yanmenguan and Niangziguan

the two sides are engaged
in vehement fights

Guys, we'll die sooner or later

Killed by Japs
we are at least heroic martyrs

Guys, charge!

Charge!

Please send reinforcements right now

Hello...

Taiyuan is lost...

Commander He...

More enemies are coming

lt's the guarding gate of Taiyuan

Your One-armed Colonel

Get him up there

Not a single enemy can be let go
Yes, sir

Colonel...

He's up there already

Sir

Now you've seen for yourselves

your Brigadier has died for the country

l'll be taking his place now

We must get Height 1 300 back

lf someone backs off just one step

my pistol will not tolerate

Should l back off

everyone of you can shoot me

Tommy gun!

No, you can't go up there

You can't get through

Right, you can't get through

Please wait, sir!

We'll go

l'll fight to death together with you

Yes, sir

Tell Colonel to retreat

Yes, sir

Sir, we're ordered to retreat

What? What did you say?

Niangziguan was lost

Why?

This is the latest intelligence
on the Japs

They moved forward so fast that

even before Yan's
2nd defense line was formed

they've broken through

Dispatch work groups
to all the counties in Shanxi

to set up anti-Japanese
democratic regimes

and train local guerilla teams

just like hens laying eggs

by making hen roosts everywhere

Fu Zuoyi is
a well-known defending general

He won't give up Taiyuan easily

l've persuaded him not to be

too particular about
the loss of one or two cities

We are good at guerilla warfare

But they are not so flexible

Our HQs will move further south

to be prepared for the loss of Taiyuan

Sir, telegram from the Generalissimo

Move to the south?

People can move, what about properties?

No Parties or Armies can be counted on

We have to rely upon ourselves

l will live or die with the city

We can't afford to lose Taiyuan

lf the city is lost
so will the province be

Sir. Doihara's division
is rushing here from the east

while Tojo Hideki
is coming down from the north

Taiyuan is about to fall really soon

Maybe we should have done as Zhu De said

ln Shanxi and North China

the frontal warfare by KMT is over now

Self-dependent mountain guerilla warfare

by CPC will play major roles in the War

From the telegram by Chairman Mao

The Situation and Our Tasks
After the Loss of Taiyuan

Our experiences so far show that

Chinese armies are still
no match for the Japanese

Sir, an unknown cadre is here to see you

He mentioned a suicide team

Just outside

Suicide Team! Get him here

Yes, sir Wait, l'll go and see him

l'm here to see Commander Zhu

l am Zhu De

Commander-in-chief Zhu!

l'm Bo Yibo, a CPC member

l know who you are

Before l left Yan'an, Mao mentioned you

saying you're young and talented

You set up a Suicide Team

and an anti-Japanese base

in the Wutai Mountains

You're really something

l'm embarrassed

This is the first time l met you

You're not what l expected

You look just like an ordinary farmer

Peng said our 3 divisions will go

to the Japs' rear area

l wonder what my suicide team
is supposed to do

You'd better evacuate from Wutai

lt's not easy for you to set up the team

lt's led by CPC

but it's also a part of Yan's troops

They're all youngsters from Shanxi

We must make the best use of them

Ok then
take your team to southern Shanxi

They are all from Shanxi

They know how to stimulate
the local people

The North Bureau of CPC
Command of 2nd Theater

and Office of 8th Route Army need

at least 3 to 4 days
to evacuate from Linfen

We decided that you take 2 companies

to check southbound enemies on your way

The Guard has only 3 companies

l'll take just one with me

One company is not enough

With two you can have two defending lines

But... They're more important to you

You take two companies
we're fine with just one

and won't be exposed so easily

Besides, the three companies

will meet in a few days anyway

l'll go right now Ok

You take care

Zhu, l've never heard such a thing as

Commander-in-chief has no troops

and vice chief of staff's striking
in the battlefield

Get ready and set out now

Guo Yes, sir

Hongdong County men reported that

the Guangshengshang Temple in Huoshan

houses a copy of 'Dazang Sutra'

Tell Bo Yibo right now to have it

remove to a safer place

Yes, sir

Commander

Commander Zhu

Xiaoping, Bocheng, how come you're here?

386th Brigade will stay with HQs

lt's too dangerous
without guarding troops

Chen Geng with 386th Brigade
is here to report for duty

No need, the harder you strike out there

the safer we will be here

Biaolishan River, Shanxi

lt's easy to defend
and hard to attack here

l don't think so

This Fenhe River Valley is in front of us

lf we march along the valley

once we're in the Taihang

who can stop us?

Our capturing Taiyuan

shows their defending
has crashed thoroughly

They are fleeing to southern Shanxi

to a small town called Linfen

We can wipe them out right there

The communists are guerilla guys

They won't stay inside the town

The KMT army has well been defeated

So our focus is to eliminate
CPC's 8th Route Army

l'll go and capture Zhu De alive

China's population is 450 million

and 80% are farmers

So far, none of the farmers

has said to the world
what he wants to say

But you have become Commander-in-chief
of 8th Route Army

ln our 8th Route Army
Peng Dehuai and Zuo Quan

are also guerrilla experts

ln our 8th Route Army
Peng Dehuai and Zuo Quan

are also guerrilla experts

But it has been four days

Zuo Quan hasn't come back
from the battlefield yet

But it has been four days

Zuo Quan hasn't come back
from the battlefield yet

Please

Where are our 3 divisions now?

Zuo Quan is back

Really? That's great!

Well, l'll take you to Zuo Quan

So you won't always interview me

Please

We have no photo studios here

See handprints of our daughter Beibei

My dear wife. Got your letter

Although you are not able to

take a picture of our daughter

l feel satisfied to see her handprints

Back from the 4 days and 3 nights battle

the first thing l did was to write to you

lf l died in the battle

l wouldn't have any regret

for all my life except that

l've never seen our daughter

and done nothing for her

as a father

So please kiss her more since l can't

Hi, Commander-in-chief Hi

Ms. Smedley, Ms Zhang interprets

Commander-in-chief

Peng Dehuai's troops have started out

We shall leave at once

What about me?

You'll be sent to Yan'an as arranged

l wouldn't go anywhere

lt's hard for a woman like you on the way

l didn't want to be a woman

God made me one!

l didn't want to be a woman

God made me one!

Ms. Smedley

l hope you obey the orders

Your biography will be named
'The Great Path'

lt's not that great

Actually it's a tortuous path

just like this one under our feet

Commander-in-chief of 8th Route Army

is seeing off a foreign female journalist

l'd say it's the son of Chinese peasants

seeing off the daughter
of an American miner

Can l bid farewell to you
as Americans do?

We both are wearing uniforms
of 8th Route Army

and armbands too

So we should bid farewell as soldiers do

l love 8th Route Army

The rear guard is fighting with
over 1000 enemy soldiers

Great

Hold them down till dusk

The more are attracted to us

the safer HQs will be

Got it

The KMT men crossed the Yellow River

Yan Xishan retreated to Qiulin, Shanxi

Wei Lihuang to Luoyang, Henan

We won't

We'll be guerillas on Mt. Taihang

Planes are coming, go and hide

Yes, sir

Got it

They bombarded Guzhen in Qinshui

Guzhen?

Leave here

Follow up

He is really a prophet

lf he said they won't bomb, they won't

lf he said they will, and here they are

He knows their minds too well

The town they're bombing
is also called Guzhen

lt shows their real target is us

They bombed the wrong place
so they'll come back

Follow up

He's really smart

Hurry up

Lie up

Hurry up

We knew 104th Brigade has got into

the heart of 8th Route Army's base

The Japanese national flag is flicking
on the roof of their HQs

l can imagine

you're reading my telegram
on Zhu De's chair

We are exited about and jealous of this

Where is Zhu De now?

Sir, we've monitored
radio signals near here

lt must be Zhu De...

lt must be Zhu De? Good

Set out now

Right turn! Eyes front!

Guo Yes, sir

Everyone will be given a bayonet, rifle

Have they got them?

Yes, sir Where's mine?

Set out! Yes, sir

Hurry up

Lie up

Load

Bandits, you Japanese bandits

Guo Yes, sir

Telegraph to Liu and Deng

to come and rescue local people

Wait. No telegraphing

They've decoded our telegram
so they're here so soon

You Japanese bandits...! Let me out!

Those can tell where their radio is

can be released

Yes, sir

Listen carefully

lf you tell us where their radio is

l'll let you out

Go and send it now!
What are you waiting for?

Turn it on, l'll talk to Liu and Deng

l really mean talk, uncoded

My classmate...

l want to...

What?

What did you say?

Commissar Deng

HQ's talking, l can't understand

to my classmate at Frunze
lt's Zuo Quan

l'm your classmate
at Sun Yat-sen University

ls Commander-in-chief safe now?

l'm your classmate at Frunze

Got it

Ye's 772nd Regiment is close to you...

Sir

They're talking in an unknown language
not Chinese

What?

l'll send Ye right now to close them in

lt sounds like Russian

Yes, it is Russian

l wish l had
a Russian Japanese dictionary

You Japanese bandits!

Hurry up

You bandits

Hurry up

Let's go

Retreat

Ye Chenghuan's here

Retreat...

Spear Team is here to report for duty

Ok, go and rescue them Yes, sir

No, retreat

Charge

How about the local folks?

They're safe now

But Commander Ye was killed

Go get them!

Go get them now!

Please

Vice Commander-in-chief

The Japs wanted to drive us
across the River

And we're having the meeting
in their rear area

Congratulations to you

Let me introduce them to you

Vice Commander of 129th Division
Xu Xiangqian

Commander-in-chief of Red 4th Army

We fought but never met each other

We now met each other
and will never fight

No discord, no concord

Commander-in-chief Zhu

l'm Zhu Huaibing

l hope you won't be
as stingy as Yan Xishan

Better show us
some secrets for resistance

Mao's 'On Protracted War' is the secret

Our enemy now is more powerful

but we've got more people

China is always
on the side of righteousness

As long as we count on the local people

and adopt the right way of fighting

we'll get them into stalemate

depleting their forces

and eventually win over Japan

Excellent

lt sounds like the best way
for the time being

Mao Zedong's 'On Protracted War'

lsn't that guerilla thing?

We're all armymen

No military theory
takes guerilla as tactics

Protracted war is not merely
a guerilla thing

But to raise it to a strategical level

is really something new

l'm a veteran armyman

l never care about

the origin of a certain fighting method

What do you care then?

l care if it works or not

lf it works, it is a good one

Salute!

This is Cui, head of local guerrillas

What military school are you from?

Sir, l have never studied
l like 'Generals of the Yang's'

l've enjoyed playing with spears

When the Japs came
l just do as what l played

to fight with the devils, finished

'Generals of the Yang's'?

you militia can fight with the devils?

lf you civilians can fight

what are we armymen supposed to do?

lf all the ordinary people can fight

can the Japs stay here long?

Cui, just show them some of your trophies

Yes, sir

Even more than
we professionals have captured

That's true

Guerilla

lt really has a tactic of wasps

They only sting
the stupid horse of Japanese army

its ass, its ears

and even its penis

Ok, you can pick up trophies for your own

They're gifts from Commander Zhu for you

This is a Japanese sword

That's a 38' rifle

Commander-in-chief Wei

Do you know what l want most?

A group of commissars from 8th Route Army

Ok

The scrap iron
is donated by the local people

Some women and kids even carried it here

lt's really hard for them

Those are from troops to be repaired

Some are from 129th Division

Good...

We captured these mortars

at the Xiangtangpu Campaign

They're still in good condition

Can we make them?

No problem, we've got engineers

old workers and students from Beijing

No problem at all

Wonderful

Let's invite Commander-in-chief
to give us a speech

Thanks, comrades

l'd like to thank you
on behalf of all the soldiers

With your wisdom and labor

with the local people as our backing

we'll win the people's war for sure

You know lyrics of 'Song of Guerillas'?

No guns, no cannons

Our enemy will make for us

We'll not only take what they made

but also make them ourselves

To achieve the final victory

spears and swords are not enough

landmines and grenades are not enough

we have to make guns and cannons

even planes and warships

Bravo!

Lieutenant General!

We actually first met each other

at a parade of 8th Division, is that so?

Yes, l was Commander of 32nd Company

of 16th Regiment of 8th Division
l was a Captain

Only two years passed
and you are a lieutenant general

This is peerless in the lmperial Army

The credit goes to His Majesty Mikado

l'm very honored to have you

Senior General Hisaichi here

l'd like to express our gratitude

and wish Abe a sweeping victory

Thanks

Please prove that
you're the pride of Japan

l understand

This is my super honor

The honeymoon between KMT and CPC

against us is over

This is very helpful to lmperial Army

Abe is about to attack
Nie Rongzhen's troops

l wish you success

Cheers Cheers...

At 6th Session of 6th Conference of CPC

Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership
in the Party

has been reaffirmed

The Central Committee praised

8th Route Army
for its resistance against Japan

Come on it and sit

The session also made strategic plans

of gaining the leadership of resistance

Comrades

the Committee ordered
to arouse the local people

and start up guerilla wars
against the Japs

A brand new phase is about to come

CPC must bear the whole country in mind

Mao Zedong asked
the whole Party to be alert

United front doesn't mean solidarity only

Struggle is equally important

We must be ready for
KMT's anti-Communist attacks

Hidenori Abe of Japanese army in Mongolia

has been transferred to Hebei

He's the mountain warfare expert

Stop

Buried there are 500 of our soldiers

who were ambushed and killed
in an encounter

Cremate the bodies
and take the ashes with us

The guerilla thing of Zhu and Mao

won't work with me

l'll deal with you the same way

as they deal with us

You just swallow the bait

Get rid of him

Only days ago he got promoted

Now he's attacking the heart of our base

He's really ambitious

The Japs got assistance

Zhu Huaibing's attacking our base
in northern Hebei

Sun Chu's attacking our Suicide Team
in southern Shanxi

Yan Xishan befriended the Japs

A Japanese called Kawada Daisaku

was a senior staff officer
in Guandong Army

Now he is head of
Shanxi lndustry Co., Ltd

He is colluding closely with Yan

Chiang's also manipulating forces

to attack our bases in Yan'an

We're under attack from both sides

Go and rest early

Right

Ok, you too

Who is this?

Commander-in-chief

lt's frozen

Warm it up

Where are you from? Wutai

Sorry, Yan Xishan is also from there

What's there to be sorry for?

Xu Xiangqian
Vice Commander of 129th Division

is also from that place

l'm no match to him

When did you join the army?

Just two months ago

At Nanru Village

Yes, when our HQs were in our village

Cold?

Better now?

Go and run for awhile

No, l have to stand guard

l'll do it for you

Go ahead

Horses are marching along the mountains

ln October it is snowing on the mountains

Soldiers are thinly clad

They eliminate the Japs day and night

We can't wait for them to shoot at us
can we?

They're not Japanese after all

We must be patient now

and won't shoot before they do

Zhu Huaibing is here

Show him in

Please

Commander Zhu, please sit down

l'm not here for no reasons

l'm here for getting Jinzhou back

We're also fighting the Japs at the order

of the Generalissimo

We never borrowed this place from anyone

How can we return it?

l'm also following the orders of Chiang

to combine military
and governmental systems

l can't give away my territory
l have to get it back

Good

30 kms away is the Japanese occupied area

lf you resolve to get it back

we'll assist you at all costs

This place used to belong to 97th Army

l'll do anything to get it back

For the sake of
overall resistance situation

you'd better do anything

that'll please the Japs

Save the crap

There're only two options for you now

To leave

or to fight

We'll never leave our resistance base

To fight is your choice then?

Should someone insist

l'll be with him to the very end

Aren't you afraid that

your United Front policy will be wrecked?

Eliminating those national traitors

our United Front policy
can be better carried out

l'll see you on the battlefield

Stop

What do you want?

You were talking to
Vice Commander of 2nd Theater

also Commander of East Route Army

your direct superior

You don't even know basic army protocols

Aren't ashamed of yourself?

Even a pawn dares to checkmate

Because it is backed up by its king

Tell His Excellency Hisaichi

l've lured Nie Rongzhen's men
to Huangtuling

Please urge 26th, 1 10th Divisions

and 8th Brigade to rush there
and eliminate them

We can't afford to lose the chance

Sir

we captured a Communist spy

That's unusual

Sir

l'm Miki Kimura, a private with

3rd Squad of 2nd Platoon
under Captain Tsujimura

Nonsense!

Tsujimura's troops died for our country

No, all of the POWs joined the League

of Antiwar of Japanese Army Soldiers

But l insisted to come back

You're a real armyman

Do you want to go back to your platoon?

l...

Speak out

l want to go home

Home?

Where are you from?

A small village at the foot of Mt. Fuji

You came here just to go back home

Ok, you'll be gratified so that

our hero can propagate
patriotism back home

Thank you, sir

l'll leave the damned Mt Taihang at last

Stop

What did you say?

My home is at the foot of Mt. Fuji

Why come to Mt. Taihang in China?

No, l...

Ok

l'll pardon you for your baby act

and send you home for family reunion

Thank you, sir

l mean your bone ashes will be taken back

Your family will be given
special treatment

since you'll be in the roll of honor

No, sir

Take him away Yes, sir

Lieutenant General...

8th Route Army spared me

but the lmperial Army won't

Your Majesty, the lmperial Army is doomed

This war is abosolutely wrong
it makes no sense

Mom

Why?

Why is that?

As a Japanese

edified by imperialism for so many years

How come in just a few days

you've been brainwashed by
Communist propaganda?

Why the hell is that?

Emergent telegram from Chiang
Read it

We are ordered to retreat
to east of Bai-Jin

Major KMT forces are moving towards us

ls Chiang helping the Japs
or the Japs helping Chiang?

This isn't an ordinary military struggle

Defeating Abe

can stimulate the morale of the Chinese

Defeating KMT's anti-Communist troops

will force Yan Xishan to hang on

Chiang's got a merit

lf you win, he will learn the lesson

We're not artists after all

Chairman Mao's theory of justification

is the art of struggle

We'll never shoot first

But if he does
we won't let him go easily

Frictions... always frictions

Get rid of him once all

then he won't bother us anymore

Counterattacking Zhu Huaibing
is a political fight

Commissar Deng'll be in charge

lt's a go!

lt's a go!

Counterattack now!

We've besieged
Zhu Huaibing's army command

What shall we do with him?

First, don't kill him

Second, don't capture him

Third, escort him out of our base

Violators will be executed

Fourth, make it clear to everyone

No retaliation what so ever

Violators will be executed

Halt!

Left and right turn!

Dress left and right, dress!

Eyes front!

Sir, under orders of
Vice Commander-in-chief Zhu

we're here to escort you out

You're Cui...

Cui Erdan

Director, Commander Cui

l'm honored...

Salute!

Sir, we failed to crush the Suicide Team

Wei Lihuang didn't help at all

A letter from Mao Zedong

Read it

lt's his personal letter

He hopes the conflict in Shanxi
be resolved peacefully

CPC sincerely wants to
fight against the Japs

not here to expand their domain

What about the telegram from the Japs?

Keep it

lf the resistance fails
Shanxi'll belong to the Japs

lf we win, it'll be taken by KMT

Chiang, the Communists, Japan

they're all troublesome

l'm dancing on three eggs

None of them can be broken

Really tough

My friend

Chiang appointed me
to be the chief negotiator

the most important reason is that

he thinks we are personal friends

But l told him the Communists

care nothing about personal friendship

No...

we are not heartless and ungrateful

l like to be direct

Now the justice is on your side

l have to beg you not to
let me go back empty-handed

At least some sort of fruit

l know you're telling the truth

l'll be equally sincere

The map

ls this map of garrisons
of both sides accurate?

Very accurate

The road from Linfen and Tunliu

all the way to Changzhi
Pingshun and Cixian

will be our boundary

Please say it again

Along Linfen, Tunliu, Changzhi, Pingshun

and Cixian, we can draw a line

all our men south of it
will be withdrawn to its north

You said all of your troops?

Exactly

You won't even keep a bridgehead?

Not a single one

And you're asking for?

Only one thing

Don't overstep it to pick quarrels

Resistance is more important

My friend

so now our negotiation is finished?

Finished

Do you mean it?

l mean it

Commander-in-chief

Zhu De is a victor
how come he gives away his territory?

He's benevolent and uprighteous

Telegram from Nie Rongzhen Ok

Local farmers at Huangtuling said

a Japanese general was spotted over there

Something big

lt's so nice of the local people

Our way is to rely on the people

This advantage can never be copied
by our rivals

Remind Nie Rongzhen

to use all his men and power as well

They've got captured mortars

and what HQs sent them, enough

107... it's a big fish

107 roger

The guy dares to stare at me

Get rid of him

Front left, 793 Height

Front left
793 Height is 8th Route Army's command

Fire! Yes, sir!

Get ready!

Sir, we're all set

OK

All mortars, get ready, fire!

East...

'Asahi Shinbun': The Flower of
a General Withered on Mt. Taihang

May, 1940

l went back to Yan'an as ordered

Chairman Mao mentioned

a stubborn old man in ancient times
who removed Taihang

saying Commander-in-chief Zhu
is doing the same

l'm not that capable

Since September 1937

when we crossed the Yellow River

2 years and 8 months have passed

We've annihilated
1 30,000 Japanese soldiers

while our own army has been expanding

and has created a situation of stalemate
in North China

What are the secrets?

First, we relied on
Mao's military strategy thoughts

Second, we relied on
3 divisions of 8th Route Army

Third, we relied on
the local people of Mt. Taihang

Chairman Mao also expected you to

go back
for the 7th National Party Congress

and to take care of
national military work in Yan'an

l miss...

l miss Mt.Taihang very much

Half of my life l'd been engaged in wars
but all civil wars

only to fight against invaders
in the last two years

lt's the responsibility of
a veteran soldier to our nation
