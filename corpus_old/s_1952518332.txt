Our state has been the pioneer in
out shore drilling

and this nation

depends on all natural gas that we provide.

and it's enough.

and I mean enough ...

they can bring me great pleasure this moment

that standing next to one of the
greatest all man of our century.

Jethro Tibbons

on behalf of the people of this state

I will drill the first hole thru the
100 million dollar a platform

United States

and I support him completely.

Thank you

I'm head back to the fund raise

No buts, just be quite, just cancelled.

I want you head back
to Central Command

I want arrive with Tim, I want Simon, and cob's in the
Hill View.

No buts, okay? do it.
I have a busy schedule today.

I am busy.

Now you Want to talk about something?

Why don't we talk about the soar of
unemployment in this country?

Why don't we talk about Americans
without health care?

Why don't we talk about roads and bridges
that need to be built in this country?

What wee have to do for this country?

right now.

Let's talk about that!

Can We talk about the failed energy policies
of your party, because of cosy relationships
with Big Oil?

that costing this nation dully?

Well Gretna, I am sorry you feel that way

but we believe those taxes got worth.

as you cannot taxes the business owners

without expecting some tripple down  effect of the fall
household's.

So you would rather this country shrinking
middle class shoulders the taxes burden.

What about the deficit?

That is all time high

What about the national debt that gonna pass down
to my grandkids

It is no secret

that we are facing some challenges

But we have the plan

to dress the concern of all American’s

And we will march to Washington

And we will get thing done

I believe Americans want a change

And I'm the man to deliver it.

How can you say that will change things

with over 150 lobbies in your campaign?

Gretna

All these people take a leave of absences’

to work for me

How cute! a lobbies, is a lobbies, is a lobbies

The is the first rule of the Capital Hill.

Well, I bet it's different.

See, what I believe... is that

Americans want and need

Someone who understands their pains.

Someone who can relate

Not only that, someone who has the courage

to lead them.

Stand up for them ...
and fight for them.

Senator ...

you can relate

Forbes magazine has your net worth
estimated at over 100 million dollar,

How can you relate the working class
American?

We'll let the Senator answer the question
when we come back after this break..
GOT TO PAY SOME BILLS. .

That's an order, sir?

Yes,that's an order, thanks.

Man, that Tibbons is amazing.

Kick out of his house when he is 16.

35 cent in his pocket

and he pushed himself far from the boothstrap,

you hear me?

Yes, sir.

That man...

now sits on a Ford 400 list...

and that's what the discussion is all about

It is cheaper to hit with the taxes break

but that is easily as exemplified
won, you know

He still earn for handout

by a tragedy that happened years ago.

Hey man

I'm from Greensburg Louisiana

I'm a country boy hard.

You understand me?

Yes sir.

Bail out beggers and money grows up at
Wallstreet and all those politicians

Senator, I would like to switch our focus now,
possible to more domestic issues campaign finance

I must admit, you are very effective in this area

Cross the isle with some great compas,
must get reform legislation path.

Well Thank you, Gretna.

Actually I'm very proud of that. We
worked very hard

to adhere to the principles that we
committed to ..concerning

make contributions and the
special entries.

Compromised into the electoral process

of course

As always we meet a lot of resistance
in Washington.

but

we got a gun

and

my leadership

was instrumental in getting it done.

and the last tab, I believe that I play demonstrate as
a president of United States.

but one quick question, if you do not mind.

Your opponents been openly critical about
your's in this issue.

he said and I quote Senator Edmond  is not being
straight with the  American people about campaign
financing lupus''

what are you say about this?

Well, that's exactly the type of politics that
we run.. from

you see ...  it same old, same old Washington,
Pardington bickering  ...

and finger point. .

See, they don't want to talk about the other side.
What they don't want to talk about

is how they gonna raise
our taxes.

make the government bigger

when it should be smaller

and more responsible.

Well, have they been less hand off smaller government
during the morgues crisis may be we wouldn’t be
in recession right now.

but more importantly, Senator, before we get
off track, there is lot talk about Article 527
in the tax code.

that gonna allow organizations and foundations
to raise unlimited money

and campaigning for whatever issue they chose
that's like they switch both better

against Shawn Kerry

Now, our sources are estimated that leadership
for American fund has tab

a sum of 35 million dollar that will be used
campaigning against your opponents

and a your convention host committee

has also raise a tons of cash

and all this is outside the
campaign finance boundaries

imposed by your legislation in Congress.

Is that a lupo, Senator?

is that what your
Opponents talking about?

Gretna, the first and for most ...
We have not broken any laws

and will continue to open our honest
to these of Americans people.

trust me, Gretna.

Trust me.

I literally wrote that law.

How can you talk so
freely about changes

when it's just more the same.

same of player, same of game and rhetoric’s

isn't it all just the smoke screen
the rich can get richer

and the poor can stay regret.

and I mean, how's big is the gap between
the have and have not?
-Oh boy...

and who was paying those lobbies, before they
starting working for you?

and why did they choose to work for you?

But it does make sense somebody need
to serve your drinks

and clean your big houses.
-you know what, you better need to hang those...
we can spent a lot of times.

you better need get to use to answer the
tough questions.

I will be calling your boss, you liar.

You want your big government to fix's every
problems in your life.

That's why we have third generations welfare families

and how about 40 million babies that you
prochoice that a chance of life you stupid bitch?

This man will be the next
president and whether do you folk's like it or not.

Hey scan bee,
-as how the pretty dam job going on ?

it's still taken event,

and I let you know when its over.

Do you think about the whore so all
thing back there?

I wonder if they need a bodyguard.

maybe I can retire early.

yes, maybe they can drop a grand and pay off
my college loans.

I got two mortgages.

I got to fee braady bunch,

But at lease it is not be bad
as the Cob's wife.

She works for the CIA

You know he cannot hide any money.
