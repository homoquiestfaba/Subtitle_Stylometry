[ Siren Wailing In Distance ]   

    [ Sniffs, Clears Throat ]   

                We found a body.

            Her throat was slit 
            from ear to ear.    

    Imagine she bled out        
    pretty quickly after that.  

        But her killer          
        didn't stop there. He-- 

        Well, the pictures      
        speak for themselves.   

        Not very pretty anymore.
        I know.                 

What does any of this           
have to do with me?             

            Something. Nothing. 

        That's what I'm here    
        trying to figure out.   

                You recognize   
                that man?       

            No.                 

            No? Are you sure?   

            Yes.                

        Yes, you're sure,       
        or yes, you recognize   
        the man in the photo?   

    Am I in trouble?            

    Maybe I should, um,         
    have a lawyer?              

        Right now, you and I,   
        we're just having       
        a friendly conversation.

            No one else is here.

        You tell me             
        you want an attorney,   
        that's your right.      

        But see, you lawyer up, 
        and, uh, that makes me  
        start to think...       

            that you got        
            something to hide.  

            You got something   
            to hide, Gemma?     

            So I ask again:     

    do you recognize this man?  

    It's Henry.                 
        Dr. Henry Moorehouse.   

        Resident brain          
        over at Baxter Pharm    
        for quite a few years...

            before they had     
            to let him go for-- 

            Well, it looks like 
            "unspecified mental 
             health issues."    

I still don't understand        
what any of this has to--       

                Tell me about   
                your involvement
                with Moorehouse.

            You two were close. 

    That a question?            

                See, along with 
                Miss Sullivan,  

I've got a half a dozen bodies  
laying in the morgue,           

all with similar CODs           
that all somehow keep           
connecting back to Moorehouse.  

    Only, when we finally track 
    the son of a bitch down,    

        someone's already gone  
        and burned the place    
        to the ground.          

    The tech lab was able       
    to salvage a few hard drives
    found in the rubble.        

            But the information 
            on those drives...  

        poses more questions    
        than it does answers.   

                    That's where
                    you come in.

        We already know         
        you worked under him    
        for the last few months.

        I need to know what     
        made Henry Moorehouse   
        murder those people.    

    I'm thirsty.                

                We can get you  
                some water.     

            Now, start          
            from the beginning.

<i>You're ready?</i>                   
<i>[ Gemma ] Give me a sec.</i>        

Okay.                           

                [ Sighs ]       

        Hello. I am             
        Dr. Henry Moorehouse.   

    During my tenure            
    at Baxter Pharmaceuticals,  

I was on the brink              
of developing the basis         
for a genetic-level vaccine...  

    that could provide          
    the human body with         
    a type of blanket immunity. 

What I'm about to show you--  
So this is what,              
  a cure for cancer?            

                May-Maybe.      
                Think bigger.   

Bigger than cancer?             

                This is a cure  
                for everything. 

        Hepatitis,              
        rabies, influenza,      
        HIV, even cancer.       

        A universal cure        
        that could save millions
        of lives every year.    

How is that even possible?      

            Baxter didn't       
            believe me either.  

            "A waste            
             of time and money,"

            I believe was       
            their exact wording.

Is that why you left?           

            I didn't just leave.

                I took what was 
                rightfully mine.

            Say hello to ELA.   

    [ Gurgling ]                
        I designed her myself.  

    ELA is a living incubator,  
    in vitro and in vivo.       

        She's a breeding ground 
        for a meta-virus...     

            with a unique       
            genetic signature...

        that absorbs, replicates
        and re-codes...         

    any viral load              
    introduced into her system. 

        And from the meta-virus 
        I can engineer          
        a retrovirus.           

                And from that-- 
A universal vaccine.            

        Well, in theory anyway. 

                    [ Sighs ]   
Is it alive?                    

        ELA continues to mature 
        at an astonishing pace. 

    At this rate,               
    we'll be able to begin      
    phase-one serum trials...   

    a full six months ahead     
    of originally anticipated.  

    She's proving to be         
    every bit the miracle       
    I had hoped and planned for.

<i>Gemma-- I fear she</i>              
<i>doesn't quite grasp...</i>          

<i>the importance</i>                  
<i>of what we're doing here...</i>     

    and what Baxter would do    
    if they ever found us out.  

        Still, her presence     
        has been...             
        a welcome addition.     

Remember, kids,                 

don't try this at home.         

[ Henry ]                       
Initiating phase one...         

                        now.    

Here we go.                     
That's it.

Shit.                           
We're red-lining, Henry.        

We're red-lining.               
    No, no, no.                 
    She should be fine.         

The serum                       
should be working.              

    Hang on. Hang on.           

                Give me 20 cc's 
                of atropine.    

            Jesus.              
Where?                          

            It's not working.   

        Henry, it's not working.

            [ Gurgling ]        

Oh! Fucking gross.              

[ Henry ]                       
Gemma!                          

[ Gemma ]                       
We're rolling.                  

    [ Whispering ]              
    Why didn't you tell me?     

    Today is                    
    a very special day.         

                    [ Gurgling ]

If my calculations              
are correct--                   

and they are--                  

today is going to be            
the turning point               
in man's evolutionary journey.  

                    [ Gurgling ]

[ Gemma ]                       
So much for survival            
of the fittest.                 

    This is survival            
    of the fittest...           

    but on                      
    a cellular level.           

    The, uh,                    
    meta-virus generated        
    within the host body...     

is designed to attack           
weaker cell structures          
and replace them with its own.  

These new cells                 
are hard-coded...               

to be resistant                 
to the introduction             
of outside virus cells...       

or even cancerous cells         
generated within the body.      

So, here we go.                 

First, I'll be extracting       
50 cc's of fluid...             

from one                        
of the lymphatic nodes--        

Henry!                          
        Don't-- Don't touch me! 

            Henry, your hand.   
                Don't touch me. 

                Your hand.      
                    Don't--     

        Henry! Henry?           

                    Henry.      

        [ Muffled, Fading ]     
        Henry, can you hear me? 

        Can you hear me, Henry?

in response...                  
[ Heavy Breathing ]             

    to a...

[ Grunts ]

[ Coughing ]                    

            I thought you said  
            it wasn't sentient. 

It's not. Not--                 

Not in the way that--           
that you and I                  
would perceive it.              

        What if you're wrong?   

How's-- How's that?             

    Well, what if this is       
    a sign from the universe... 

    that... we're not supposed  
    to be fucking around        
    with this kind of thing?    

Language.                       
                    I'm serious.

            We're supposed to   
            get sick...         

                and grow old... 
                and die.        

    What happens when you take  
    that out of the equation?   

You're-- You're underestimating 
what I'm doing here.            

What-What I'm doing is much     
more important than that.       

                    Is it?      

You give it time. You'll see.   

[ Henry ]                       
Recording?                      

                    It's okay.  

            She's dormant now.  

        [ Respirator Wheezing ] 

What's up?                      
We cure cancer yet?             

            Okay.               

Guess not.                      

        I just don't understand 
        why it's not taking.    

        By all accounts,        
        it should be working.   

All right.                      
Well, I'm out.                  

Get some sleep, okay?           

[ Rumbling ]                    

            I wasn't gonna      
            hurt you, you know. 

[ Gurgling ]                    

        Yeah, yeah. I get it.   

Do not touch.                   

                    [ Gurgling ]

    [ Mouthing Words ]          

Excuse me.                      

            [ Marker Rattling ] 

Adding an amino acid string     
to the base...                  

may help prevent                
the meta-virus from             
cannibalizing the host cells.   

The only question               
is how to prevent               
the molecular burnout...        

that occurs--                   
            How about adding    
            a protein receptor? 

It inhibits replication         
of the meta-virus,              
rendering it unusable.          

    - Yes, but if we were to--  
    - Will you please just...   

let me concentrate?             

                            Doc?

            You're gonna want   
            to come see this!   

            So, what are we     
            looking at exactly? 

I'm not entirely sure.          

Although ELA's cell structure   
was designed to mimic our own,  

she has and continues           
to accelerate                   
at an exponential rate.         

            Huh.                

                So?             

            I would be remiss   
            in postulating

a pretty tough time for me.     

    I, um--                     

It was just me and Dad,         

and Dad wasn't exactly          
around all that much.           

I was a stupid kid              
doing a lot of stupid shit,     

and... I got myself             
into a lot of trouble.          

Dad caught on                   
during the worst of it...       

and threw my ass                
into rehab for a summer.        

I cleaned up my shit,           

actually started                
going to school,                

and I've done pretty okay       
for myself ever since then.     

So boom!

explodes right in his face.     

Burns off, like,

And by this point,              
we've nearly burned down,

                weren't caught? 

    Hell no.                    

You've never seen

[ Weakly ]                      
I don't need a hospital.        

I need to finish the formula.   

                It can wait.    

                    Come on.    

I had a son once.               

        I...                    

    married a...                

    truly awful girl.           

I was young and... dumb...      

when it came                    
to that sort of thing.          

But Jacob--                     

he was something else.          

    There was this...           

    light in his eyes.          

        I...                    

can't really explain it.        

It's called...                  

lymphocytic                     
choriomeningitis.               

[ Gurgling ]                    

    Horrible thing.             

We did the best we could, but-- 

    [ Laughs ]                  

She blamed me for his death...  

if you can imagine that.        

I guess I did too.              

[ Gurgling ]                    

She left me                     
immediately after.              

    And--                       

And within a month,             

I was transferred...            

to Baxter's Special             
Biologies Division.             

                    ELA.        

She was just                    
a hypothesis then.              

    But...                      

if there was...                 

    any way...                  

to prevent                      
what happened to Jacob,         

    it was...                   

    up to me...                 

    to find it.

            He was a scientist, 
            like you, once.     

            Well, not exactly   
            like you.           

                He worked, um,  

                with nuclear    
                fission mostly. 

                He was a really,

            really smart guy.

                He started, um, 

            talking to himself--
            more than normal.   

                Then he started 
                talking to...   

        people who, um,         
        weren't really there.   

            And then

to reverse it.                  

            What good is        
            one little girl...  

            against the legacy  
            of evolution?       

            There's no place    
            in science...       

        for a junkie like you.  

            Your daddy was right
            to abandon you.     

I'm gonna kill you,             

            you fucking Judas.  

You hear me, bitch?             

        I am going...           

                to destroy you. 

                [ Muttering ]   
                Fucking bitch.  

                    Die.

[ Exhales ]                     

                        Gemma?  

                What is that?   

It's your formula, Henry.       

                    Impossible. 

            You couldn't have   
            completed my work.  

    Why?                        

'Cause I'm just                 
some stupid fucking girl?       

You know, you never...          

actually                        
gave me a chance...             

to show you                     
what I was capable of.          

But you're right.               

I didn't finish                 
your formula.                   

You did.                        

This whole time...              

you were looking                
for the "X" factor...           

when it was right there         
in front of you.                

    You don't know              
    what you're talking about.  

Your infected blood, Doc.       

                You're lying!   

            You... are lying.   

Am I?                           

                When I am free, 

        I'm going to rip you... 

            from cunt to throat.

        And then                
        I'm going to drain...   

        every last drop of you. 

This is gonna hurt.             

A lot.                          

                    No--        

        [ Gagging, Spitting ]   

Henry?                          

[ Reverberating ]               
Henry, wake up. Wake up!        

Wake up!                        

                    [ Sobbing ] 

[ Gagging ]                     

[ Gagging, Grunting ]           

                    Fuck.       

    Language.                   

            [ Crying ]          

    What happens next?          

                    Are you sure
                    about this? 

When you find...                

something in this world         
that's...                       

so unique, incredible...        

        and beautiful,          

            the first thought is
            to cut it open...   

        and see how it works.   

            But the next thing  
            you know,           

it's just a bloody mess,        

and you don't know why          
you had to tamper with it       
in the first place.             

The beauty is gone.             

Never get it back.              

The cure                        
is too dangerous...             

for us to risk it               
getting out into the world.     

If anyone were to               
find out what we had,           

it'd be                         
the end of mankind              
as a species.                   

                And us?         

We go on living.                

Cheers.

I love you.

            In time...          

            I hope...           

<i>you will come to understand</i>

        That's quite the story  
        you've got there.       

I told you                      
you wouldn't understand.        

        What I understand...    

    is that Henry Moorehouse... 

    is a sick fucking monster!  

    We're all monsters.         

        Henry?                  

    He transcended that.        

He really was                   
on to something.                

            So Moorehouse...    

    destroyed all his work...   

        and killed himself,     

leaving you as                  
a convenient sole survivor...   

            to tell his story?  

He didn't destroy everything.   

Henry's blood...                

is inside of me.                

    I've been cured.

        Finish your dinner.     
        We gotta hit the road.
