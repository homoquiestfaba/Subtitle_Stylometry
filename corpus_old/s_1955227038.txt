[Music playing]


Carrie!

What the hell are
you doing, you s...


[Moaning and panting]


MAN 1: Mr. Kessler!


Mr. Kessler?

Oh.

Oh.

MAN 1: Mr. Kessler,
we're coming in!


The monk.

Pretty sharp for so
early in the morning.

Actually, I prefer to
think of it as the end

Of a long, enchanted evening.

Then I'd prefer
you didn't think.

Uh!

[Door closing]

Here you are, Mr. Masey.

Thank you.

Johnny will be
down in a minute.

I'm so sorry about your wife.

If only I had believed sooner.

But who could have imagined?

The vampire's greatest
power is the fact

That nobody believes in him.

Bram Stoker wrote that
over 100 years ago,

And it's true even today.

Would you like
some tea, Johnny?

No thanks, Karen.

How are you doing, Mr. Masey?

Depends on how you did.

Thank God.

Your wife wasn't
his final victim.

Sarah wanted him.

Well, if it's any
consolation, sir, it wasn't

Entirely voluntary on her part.

Evil can be most irresistible.

You resisted her.

She would have killed
me if you hadn't.

Well, I've had some
experience in these matters.

Well, I got what I paid for.

Here's the rest of it.

If you need any help
or money, references...

The Occult Fraternity
knows where to find me.

Go back into the
sunshine, Mr. Masey.

Leave the shadows to me.

Thank you.


Karen, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

I find that professionally
embarrassing.

There's a Catherine
Coogan here to see you.

Does she have three
sixes on her forehead?


There's something about her.

Please be careful, Johnny.

OK, I'll take the
normal precautions.

Miss Coogan!

Are you the monk?

That's just a nickname.

I'm happy to hear that.

One moment, please.

[Non-english speech]

Forgive me, Miss Coogan.

What on earth was that?

An ectoplasm detection system.

I had to be sure.

Of what?

You're being what you appear
to be, a beautiful woman.

Not something else.

Thank you, I think.

How can I help
you, Miss Coogan?

I need protection, Mr.
Blake, the kind no policeman

Can give me.

Are we talking physical
or spiritual danger?

Both.

How'd you know to come to me?

There's an occult bookstore by
my law firm on Fourth and Erie,

Raven Books.

Hans Wader's shop.

He's legitimate.

He said the monk could help
me break the family curse.

I see.

You're a lawyer?

Yes.

Corporate.

Well then, you have the floor.

You may not know it by
looking at me, Mr. Blake,

But I'm from the backwoods.

I've spent a long time
camouflaging this fact

And educating myself.

But I was born and bred
in Golgotha County, a part

Of the country that
even good Christian folk

Might find forbidding.

[Tribal music playing]

Three years before I
was born, my mother

Was the Virgin Priestess
to the demon Asmodeus.

Lord of Vice.

That's right.

Mama minded the health stone.

You heard of it?

The mystic gem that
will allow Asmodeus

To cross into our
world, once it's

Saturated with human blood.

Mama came real close to making
that happen, about 28 years ago

On Walpurgis Day.

Pagan feast of
Asmodeus occurring once

Every seven years.

Right.

And mama supplied the victims.

She lived for the demons coming.

When it is written,
the sky will darken,

And his subjects
will rule the earth.

But his worshippers
needed one more sacrifice,

Or else they'd have to wait
for the next Walpurgis.

Then they'd found him,
the boy hitchhiker.

But on that day, mama's
beauty caught the eye

Of local trapper Bo Coogan.



Unh!



Unh!



Ah!


Whatever else he was, man or
a brute, he became my father.

Papa forced mama to
live with his kinfolk.

He kept her there the rest
of her days, part wife,

Part slave.

To escape the
demon's vengeance, he

Had the Hell stone
cut three ways

And sold to three
separate jewelers.

Mama bore him three daughters;
Jenny, Caroline, and me.

She died birthing me.

Oh her 21st birthday, Jenny
disappeared without a trace.

Then Caroline vanished
on her 21st birthday.

My 21st birthday was
less than a year away.

I felt something
was waiting for me.

Something evil.


Karen!




Ah!

Unh!



Who are you?

Don't, please!
I'll pay you!

KAREN: Johnny!

Karen, no!


No!

Karen.

Are you all right?

I'm OK, Johnny.

Stay here.


Unh.

Very impressive, Johnny.

You're even earlier
than I expected.

What?

It was my turn to
make sure of you.

Makes sense, Miss Coogan.

Call me Sister Avarice.

The Hell stone.

One third of it.

That's how you
fooled my defenses.

You weren't wearing your ring.

I had to lure you into
my lair to test you.

Test me?

By killing your men?


He's wax.

All of them?

Yes.

Animated by the power
of my ring, of my will.

You know, the coven
would pay to have

The monk in their clutches,
to make you suffer

For all of us you killed.

But I have a much
better use for you.

Now, be a good boy and let
mommy give you your medicine.


Huh, that wasn't so bad.

Now you're mine, Johnny Blake.

Kneel to me.

Like hell.

As you wish.

On your knees, monk.

Now, crawl to me.


You want me, don't you, Johnny?

Why, sure you do.

Your little heart
just aches for me.

[Breathing heavily]

I never finished
telling you my story.

Would you like to
hear the rest of it?

I thought so.

You see, for my entire 20th
year, I didn't dread my fate.

I yearned for it.

And then at last it
came, in the form

Of this tall, silent stranger.

He gave me this ring containing
one third of the Hell stone.

Asmodeus' worshipers had
recovered the other two stones

Over the jeweler's dead bodies.


Of course, I didn't know any
of this until I put the ring on.

Then everything
became crystal clear.

As the demon power
surged through me,

I was not longer
Catherine Coogan.

I was... I am... Sister Avarice.

Your sisters... the
other two rings.

Uh-huh.

Rings identical to mine.

Like me, each would
kill to keep hers.

But unlike them, I shall
possess all three gems.

For that I need your help.

You're the witch.

Why don't you get on your
broom and go get them.

Very funny, Johnny.

To defeat them, I need an
edge over their sorcery.

Someone strong and cunning, yet
completely under my control.

Who better than the monk?

The great demon slayer.

Listen well, Johnny.

Both my sisters are
here in this city.

Jenny, Sister Anger, runs a
martial arts studio for women.

Caroline, Sister of Lust, runs
the most exclusive call girl

Ring in town.

I don't care what happens
to either of them,

As long as you bring me
their rings by sunset the day

After tomorrow.

You will be my pawn
in the coming match

And I will be the
last queen standing.

Do that, and I will reward you
with the pleasures of the dark.

Fail me and you'll beg
for the mercy of hell.

And remember, whatever
you do, wherever you go,

I'll be watching.




Johnny!

Johnny!

Are you home, Johnny?


Johnny, what happened?

Get out.

Johnny, I was worried.

You didn't call or
answer the phone.

Or let you in.


At least tell me what
happened out there.

You owe me that.

I um... I lost something.

What was it?

Myself.

I don't want to be forced
to hurt you, Karen.

Go on, get out.

I work for you.

Not anymore.

You're fired.

KAREN: Johnny, you can
hurt me all you want,

But I won't leave you like this.

Why not?


Don't you know?

I thought the monk
knew everything.

He used to.


For 10 years, I've fought
the powers of darkness,

Since the night my
mother and sister

Greeted me with vampire kisses.

I've survived by
resisting temptation,

But now the evil's within me.

So's the good.

Johnny!

What is it?

What's wrong with you?

Oh, it's started.

Karen, I know you want
to help, but you can't.

You wouldn't stand a
chance against her magic,

And I cannot help you.

[Breathing heavily]

Now, I'm going to go after
those rings like Avarice wants,

But I am not going
to give them to her.

Please let me help you, Johnny.

No.

It's too dangerous.

Not as dangerous as losing you.

Are you sure you're
all right about this?

Uh-huh.

And you remember
what the signal is?

Don't worry about me.

Huh!

Ah!

We're closed.

I'm looking for Sister Anger.

Business hours are
from 10:00 to 6:00.

I gotta talk to her.

You've go to listen, first.

I said come back tomorrow.

I'm in danger.

You got that right.

Think you want a quick lesson?

Greta.

That's enough.

Sorry, Sister.

I'm Sister Anger.

You wanted to meet me?

Katie.


I saw your sign outside and
decided to check you out.

I want to learn self-defense.

Why?

It's my boyfriend.

He's always hitting me.

He beats me up for no reason.

Like one night, I
forgot to buy beer,

And he smacked the
hell out of me.

Uh-huh.

I don't see any bruises on you.

Buck's been in jail for
the past three months.

Cops put them in there
last time he hit me.

And he's out now. [Sigh]

Why don't you leave him?

He's good to me sometimes.

I just want to
learn how to protect

Myself from when he goes off.

I'm sorry.

I don't teach that
Tai Chi nonsense here.

Here a woman learns
how to fight.

How to kill, if necessary.

Any man who touches
us gets hurt.

Take off your jacket.

You've got a nice body, Katie.

Nice and strong.

I could teach you
how to fight, Katie,

And no man will
ever hurt you again.

Bitch!

There you are.

Buck!

I made Sally tell
me where you were.

Of all the stupid things you've
done, this one sure beats all.

Martial arts classes?

Girl, you are asking for it.

Please, Buck!

I just thought...

Thought?

When did you start thinking?

I'm sorry!

Let go of me!

Say the word.

No.

You just stay out of this,
dyke, or I'll smack you too.

Let's get out of here.

I think I want to stay.

What'd you say?

I'm staying.

Oh, that does it, bitch.


Are you OK?

Yeah.

Unh!

Ah!

No!

Stop.

Why?

He ain't worth it.

Prove it.

How?

Kick him.


Kick him harder.


How'd that feel?

I need a drink.

Greta, take out the trash.

To my newest pupil.

Mm.

Do you really think
I'm good enough?

Oh, yeah.

I saw you kick.

It was nice and hard.

hurting him back like that.

I can't go home now.

I hurt him too bad.

I'll show you a way
to take care of him.

I could teach it to
you in 15 minutes.

It's something I usually
save for my best students.

Oh, what's that?

It's called the doom touch.

It's like a heart press,
focused and sharp.

Men actually enjoy it in the
heat of passion. [Chuckles]

They don't realize
that it's killed

Them until it's too late.

It doesn't happen right away.

It takes days,
sometimes weeks, and it

Looks just like a heart
attack, and no one

Ever suspects foul play.

How is that possible?

Mm, let's just say it's magic.

For three years now, I have been
teaching my students the doom

Touch, and they have been
marrying rich old men

And becoming rich young widows.

And they're always real generous
with their little old teacher.

You know what?

You could be one of them.

Me?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Sure you can.

got to learn to relax.

Trust me.

[Door closing]

[Breathing heavily]



Come on, Karen.

What if I mess up?

You wouldn't punish me?


I'll take real good care of you.

You mean it?

I'll prove it.

What was that?

It was the cat.

Meow.

Well, looky here.

We got ourselves a peeper.

Now listen boys, I
don't have time for this.

So I suggest you go about your
business and leave me to mine.

He talks real
good for a pervert.

I like more the
way chief talks.

Talk to him, chief.

Not a good place to be.

Ha, No, no, no, no, no.

You're going to have
to learn how to relax.


You did real good.

Now, throw me your
wallet, unless you think

That tin can can stop a bullet.

I'd just as soon find out.

Unh!

Ah!


I'll take care of this.


No need to get up.

You're going to sleep forever!

Bust his skull, Razz.

Where the hell
did you come from?

Go see for yourself.

Unh!

[Whip cracking]


[Whip cracking]

How could you, Katie?

Or should I call you Karen?

And after all we
meant to each other.

Who sent you?

[Whip cracking]

Who sent you?

Maybe it was your
little friend Buck?

Yeah.

Why don't you just make
this easy on yourself

And tell me who sent you?

I don't want to hurt you.

I really don't.

But a girl's gotta do...

[Whip cracking]

What a girl's gotta do.

Freeze, bitch!

But I'm unarmed.

See?

You can frisk me if you want.

You want to, don't you?

Run your big, strong hands
all over my little old body.

Don't come any closer.

Go ahead and shoot.

You'll never have a woman
like me outside your dreams.

Give me a kiss.



been kissed like that before.



[Whip cracking]

[Whip cracking]


[Whip cracking]

Please, Karen.

I don't want to
hurt you anymore.

Why don't you just tell
me what I want to know?

Hm?

Why don't you tell me
what I want to know?

Because otherwise we're going
to have to start all over again.

Hm?

Give me a name.

A monk.

Who?

You heard me!


Hm, he's good.

This is going to be fun.


I knew you'd be back.

Where's Sister Anger?

Sister is taking care
of business, which means

I get to take care of you.

Sister says we shouldn't like
men, but I can't help it.

I love men.

The way they struggle and
squirm as I take them apart,

Piece by piece.

Listen, Greta.

You're still human.

Now, you can walk away from
here whenever you want,

But I'm going to send your
mistress back to hell,

And nobody's going to stop me.

Stop this.

Unh!



don't hurt me anymore.

I can give pleasure
as well as pain.

You can make love
with the damned.

Ah!

[Muffled noises]

Karen.

You all right?

Johnny, look out!

[Whip cracking]

[Whip cracking]

[Whip cracking]

[Whip cracking]


KAREN: Is she dead?

Whatever she is is dead.

OK. [Sigh] It's going to sting.


I know it's going to sting.

Hold still.

Hold still.

[Sharp inhale]

I know.

You're going after the other
ring tomorrow, aren't you?

Yeah, I don't have a choice.


Who is she?


They say no man can
resist her, because she

Feeds off our sexual fantasies.

Ow.

You say she feeds on lust?

We'll make sure you
don't have any left.


[Phone ringing]

Sister Lust Escorts.

Hello, Senator.

Tammy.

10 o'clock?

Yes.

No problem, sir.

She'll be looking forward to it.

Goodbye.

[Phone ringing]

Sister Lust Escorts.

Please hold.

May I help you, sir?

I'd like to see Sister Lust.

Do you have an appointment?

With destiny.

A reference?

How about incognito?

That's a Latin reference.

It means "unknown."

I'm sorry, sir.

Sister sees no new clients
without a reference.

But if you'd care to wait, I
can have one of our sales agents

Out here.

That won't be necessary.

Give the Sister my card.

I'm sure she'll want to see me.

I'll have to talk
to Tracy about this.

Desiree.

Don't you like it?

Yeah, sure.

It doesn't fit you.

What does?

How about something Nordic?

Erica.

Mm.

Erica.

I like that.

It's all yours.

Mm, thank you.

And next time you're in here,
make sure you ask for Erica.

Mr. Blake?

Sister Lust will see you.

Please follow me.

Ah, wait.

I'm going to have to frisk
you before you go in.

I hope you don't mind.

As long as you don't
charge for the pleasure.

Not exactly a rent-a-cop, is he?

Much better.

This man puts his
soul into his work.

Sister Lust?

Johnny.

Welcome.

I've heard so much about you.

That's odd.

I thought I left most of
your friends speechless.

Oh, your reputation
survives them.

Come.

Sit.

The entertainment is
just about to begin.

Erica?

So you are the monk.

Hm.

Not exactly the grim
avenger I expected.

I'm off-duty.

No longer chasing demons?

Just purging a few of my own.

How about, oh, witches.

Can't tell them apart
from normal women anymore.

Are you sure?

What if one sat
right next to you

And got ready to do unspeakable
things to your body.

Well, that might make me
see things from her side.

Why'd you come here, Johnny?

Well, we both have
an interest in magic.

It's not just black
and white, you know.

Really?

What other kind is there?

There's red.

Ooh.

I hear it's a real
three ring circus.

And I could help make
you a ring master.

How?

By getting rid of your
siblings and bringing

The circus to your town.

Johnny, with you at my side and
my sister's rings on my hand,

No one will stand in our way.

Tracy?

Why don't you join us?

[Door opening]

You.

What?

No romance novels on
Johnny's bookshelf?

What'd you do to him, bitch?

Just satisfied his
secret ambition,

A guilt-free taste of passion.

He never would've touched
you if you hadn't hexed him.

I didn't force him to enjoy it.

But he did.

Like a kid in a candy store.

That's a lie.

What?

You think he loves you?

Silly girl.

He likes strong women.

Secure women.

Not clingy tramps like you.

Where's the ring?

I don't have it.

Hand it over, or those
scars you have will be

Your most attractive feature.

Naughty, naughty.

Second.

Tracy.


And the perfect secretary.

Types 90 words a minute
and brings coffee.

what her best skill is?

Male bosses can't seem to
keep their hands off of her.

The more professional she acts
the more frustrated they get.

But in the end, it's my
Tracy that they want.

And when they finally
cross that line,

I make them pay
a fortune for it.

And that's the beauty
of sexual harassment.

Johnny, if we're
to become partners,

We have to be partners in
every way, body and soul.

Mm.

Ah.

What's the matter, Johnny?

Hm?

Doesn't look so good to you now?

You don't want me anymore?


And I'm going to have
you for eternity.

Look into my eyes, baby.

See how they burn for you.

Look deep.

Deeper.

Ah, that's right.

Now, give me your soul, Johnny.

It's a small price
to pay for my kiss.


Don't fight me, sweetheart.

Love me.

I can give you fantasies beyond
anything you've ever imagined.

I can be every woman
you've ever wanted.

Miss Russell!

Johnny.

It's been a long time, Johnny.

You were one of my best pupils.

And no wonder.

I saw the way you
looked at me in class.

How did you get...

You were so young.

But oh, so cute.

Well, we're both adults now.

JOHNNY: Miss Russell...

Sh.

It's all right.

You like what you see?

Good.

I can teach you
things the school

Board would never approve of.

Miss Russell, no!

Miss Russell isn't here.

Corie?

Hi, Johnny.

JOHNNY: Where's...

My, what a pretty man you are.

Oh, yes.

You never noticed me before.

Sure I did.

Uh, this isn't right.

Oh, don't worry.

My parents are out of town.

No.

Not... not this.

Everything.

You.

Here.

You haven't aged.

Ah, but you have.


Stop it.

We don't have to stop.

[Kissing noises]

Karen?

You're not supposed to be here.

I know.

I just couldn't stay away.

Where's Sister Lust?

She's gone.

But I'm here now.

You don't need anyone else.

Look at me, Johnny.

Other men would kill to
have me, but I'm all yours.

You seem different.

I am.

I'm a lot stronger now.

Your love made me this way.

Do you like the new me?

Sure.

I'm going to make
you feel so good.

Take me, Johnny.

I need you, body and soul.

You're not the real Karen!



Karen!

Karen, I'm back!


Well, well, well.

If it ain't the monk.

Where's Karen?

Cathy got her.

What?

My daughter.

Catherine's your daughter?

You're Bo Coogan.

Brilliant.

But I come for this.

Why?

To keep it away
from her and you.

You are her dog.

JOHNNY: Not by choice.

BO: The party ends
just the same.

I've been watching.

She sends, and you fetch.

And I know you killed
my two other girls.

They weren't human anymore.

BO: Well, you did
what I couldn't

To my own flesh and blood,
and I owe you for that.

Though I've still
got to kill you,

I just want you to
know why, first.

Please.

Don't cut to the chase.

It's because of the demon.

Asmodeus?

You raped and kidnapped
his priestess.

And he's been
haunting me ever since.

And he's coming for me
tonight, if the demon crosses.

Tonight?

Of course.

By midnight every seven years.

It's Walpurgis Night.

The demon's powers are tonight.

That's what she wants.

What her momma
wanted 28 years ago.

The demon crossing.


Funny, ain't it?

You're the saint
and I'm the sinner,

Yet I've saved the world
and you almost wrecked it.

the whole hailstorm,

That demon can't cross,
and this rock is going

To the bottom of the ocean.

After I take care of you.

Wait.

You still haven't told me.

Why me?

Why?

Because you're too good
a dog to be tracking me.


[Electric shock]

Ah!

Ah!










I knew it would get me.

Friggin' demon.

After all these years, I
forgot about the curse.

Walpurgis Night.

The ring band must be
some sort of stop valve

Against the Hell stone's power.

I'll be damned.

Afraid so.


You're right on time.

I like that in a man.

Where's Karen?

You don't mean that
silly secretary of yours?

Is she alive?

For now.

I know what you're
thinking, Johnny.

I look so vulnerable.

One swipe of your big
old sword and... well,

What are you waiting for?

Stop fucking with me, Avarice.

Smart boy.

OK.

To business.

Where's the ring?

Not far.

mood for games, Johnny.

out the hide and seek.

You tell me where Karen is,
I'll tell you where the ring is.

You dare bargain with me?


The ring, Johnny.

Give me the ring, and
I'll stop the pain.

What are you doing?

to commit seppuku.

You're never going
to get that ring.


My ring will find it.

Don't bet on it.

Two.

One.

[Magic flowing]

You are good, Johnny.


Where's Karen?


Why do you persist in
fighting me, Johnny?

You should know by now, I'll
fight you till my dying breath.

You were asking about Karen?

Johnny.

You bitch.

Why Johnny, I believe you
have your consonants confused.

Come along and join the fun.

You've seen her.

I've held up my
end of the bargain.

Now, the ring please.

Let her go.

Johnny, I even said please.

Hm.

No?

As you wish.

I'll ask again, though
not as politely.

The ring.

Go to hell.

Johnny.



Gold box.

Clever boy.

No wonder my ring
couldn't locate it.

The third.

Where's the band?

It melted.

Well, never mind.

We're losing moonlight.

Onto the main attraction.

Leave the sword.

Good help is hard to find
and even harder to reanimate.

Make one wrong move and I'll
kill you where you stand.

And miss out on
seeing Asmodeus?

I wouldn't dream of it.

It's not that I mistrust you.

It's just that I'm
going to be otherwise

Engaged with your girlfriend.

So don't go sticking
your pretty neck out.

[Non-english]


Asmodeus, Lord of Vice,
accept my sacrifice,

That her blood shall be
your stream into our world.

I shall welcome
you as your slave.


Worship your darkness forever.


ASMODEUS: Pour the
blood, Avarice.

I thirst for the
life of your wound.

Yes, Master.

I long to serve you.

No!


Die!


Ah!



Unh!

Ah!

Karen, get out of here.

Not until you're safe.





My monk.

You are more than clever.

And what a shame.

Had you stayed on my
side and done my bidding,

We would have made
quite the pair.

Uh!

still got the rings.

And you've got... well, nothing.

But when all is said and
done, your little struggle

Here will only make Asmodeus'
triumph that much sweeter.

You'll have to
celebrate in hell!

Uh!


Karen.

Are you all right?

ASMODEUS: Nice work, monk.

I was getting a little tired
of Sister Avarice, weren't you?

Asmodeus.

What did you do with Karen?

ASMODEUS: Oh, she's still here.

But she's all mine.

Would you like to talk to her?

Johnny, don't listen to him.

ASMODEUS: Isn't she precious?

Let her go.

You could still have your
world of vice if you want.

ASMODEUS: She's my
insurance policy.

And besides, I kind
of like it in here.

She's not a part of this.

ASMODEUS: You have quite
the dilemma, don't you?

To get rid of me would entail...
Well, to get rid of her.

Let her go.

ASMODEUS: Your darling Karen.

I'm going to have so
much fun with her.


Well, I've got a lot of
things to enjoy in this world.

Karen.

Karen!

ASMODEUS: [growling]




No!
