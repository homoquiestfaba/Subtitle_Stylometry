We're the sexiest couple of
girls in the western hemisphere

I'm Tina, the one with short hair.
She's Gina, but she's not Italian

I'm more mature but much
more sexy

We're two strippers and anything
else you can easily imagine

But we have a
secret side as well

We are Red Silk...

Very efficient private eyes,

Threats, blackmail or
whatever the problem may be...

...you just need put your ad:
''I'd buy Red Silk" and your...

...phone number in the classified
section of you daily newspaper

Then, we will contact you...

...and for a reasonable price,
we'll solve your problem

Of course, we also offer
some personal services,

but these are not included
in the price

We are the perfect couple,
don't you think so?

As you can see, I am the brain
and Gina, the action

She's pretty kamikaze
and she always goes for it

Normally, we met our
clients here in the club

Here we could stimulate
our customers...

...and open they way to
their pockets

A friend of us, of the Paraiso,
a sweet drag queen, taught us this

...dance, the only we can do, as
you can see, not very well. Who cares?

He also gave us our name:
"Red Silk"

And you'll see why

We like to do it because we
are natural born exhibitionists

The night the story begins...

...our audience was small
and normal

The most interesting of them
was the millionaire Shiron Kalman

Surrounded as well by poor
kids and sinister bodyguards

He's never tried to seduce us but
he always stared at us with a hard look

We were some sort of
sexual stimulation for him

Come on, Silvia, take it easy,
I'll talk to them

Mr. Kalman is calling you
Leave me alone!

See what people ask for!

Christ, anything goes!

We've got a customer

Are you looking for Red Silk?

He sounds very young
Make an appointment

Come to the Flamingo Club
tomorrow at midnight

Sit on the big sofa,
by the window...

...and wait for us there. Bye

He might be a millionaire
Yes, like the last one, remember?

Oh, the poor thing, but he
was a nice guy

Next evening we had a real ball,

Gina was really inspired and
drove me crazy with her naughty tongue

At that moment, Matias Grunebaldi
came into our lives...

Apparently, he just wanted to take
some innocent porno artistic photos of us

But I was sure this rascal
was looking for something else

At that moment, we didn't know
that Kalman was about...

...to hire us

Nor that he was a nazi
son of a bitch

Pretty;

Hello
Take your clothes off

We are Red Silk
I bet you are. Take your clothes off

Take them off, please

If everything's off, money on

What a degenerate youth!

There's a box on the table.
Take half of it

Take more

Hey, I said half of it

Do you have eyes on your back?
The eyes of the spirit

I'm Matias Grunebaldi,
the famous painter

Do you know me? No?
What ignorance!

So you made all these
paintings?

I painted everything here, even
the walls. Take them off

Oh, how beautiful!

Oh, what a pair of bottoms!

Take them off, everything off!

The great Matias Grunebaldi
will immortalize your show

How lucky you are!

Let's see...

You're really lucky!

Go on. What a pair of bottoms!

Oh, wonderful!

Oh, beautiful bottoms!

Move, move. Oh, what a
beautiful bottom!

Oh, beautiful!

Oh, que belle! Oh, yes, yes!

Oh, yes, those bottom cheeks!

Wonderful. Move, move!

Go down!

Go down, like in the club

Come on!

Move that, that's it, shake it
with intelligence

More desire, more passion!

That way!

Fantastic. Beautiful!

Left, right, left, up!

I'm so happy looking at you.
Don't stop!

Stretch out, like this,
with tenderness

Oh, beautiful!

Be more romantic. Love
has to be romantic

Try the romanticism of
your bottom

Your bottom has to be romantic

Do you like it?
Bah! Too mechanic

What the he||...!
Go ahead, baby

More tenderness! More passion!

Your finger in your ass

Come on. How beautiful!
How romantic!

Touch the teats of your friend

Show the romanticism of
your ass hole

Deep inside. Come on!

You are very cold

I don't feel you. I think
I must help you

Come on, with joy! With
passion, with elegance!

What a shit! Let me help you

Come on!

If you want to touch, more money!
Oh, my God. What a generation!

Take it all, even the box, come on

Ah!

What a culettol

What a generation!

It has been quite all right. Little
bit rude, little bit uncultured...

...but you have a future

It shows you haven't read
the divine Marquis of Sade books...

...or heard the Britney Spear's
songs but you are superb

Duty calls

Hey! Without me, nothing!

I've got a job for you.
I'm going to give you an opportunity

Really?
A job in a foreign country

Which country?
Here, across the border.

But still being a foreign country
How much are you going to pay us?

Money? Again?
As much as today

I've just spoke to my
partner. The Count of Montecristo

Do you know him?
No

What ignorance! Well, you
have to bring a little package

Where to?
To the place of the appointment

And where's that?
Hotel Tropicana. The best of the coast

Where the princes and kings
and football players go

Thursday at ten you'll be there

When will you give us the package?
Tomorrow at 11 o'clock in the Pearl bar

Pearl like you

A traitor

But he made the impossible to
prevent the military take over

A son of a bitch
But in his book, Cayetano...

Another son of a bitch
And Costa Gomez?

Don't even mention that name,
please

The only honest man of the
whole story was Salazar

Help! Help me, please!

Help:

Go calm my poor wife down
Yes, sir

Scream, scream

-Are you sure?

Yes, madam

That old good times...

...of peace and justice!

Soon you'll be free, please
be patient, madam

The truth is we also like
hot stuff,

but at a different level

We've never gone far than
getting our ass a bit sore

There he is our billy boy
I think he is a nice guy

Oh, those fucking Mercedes!

Oh, bambine, belle!

Don't you want to join us?
I can't. I'm very busy

Where are you going?
I've an important business to take care

But, tomorrow, at ten o'clock,
at the other side of the border,

at the hotel Tropical,
it's very important

What about the packages?
Bring them. It's essential

Hey. my geranium!

That billy boy!
Yes, but he pays

He pays a shit, but he pays
and he took our bread

A piece of bread. You can't
deny him a piece of bread

Why do you think
there is in these packages?

You know, that kind of shit the
photographers always carry with them

-Let's see what's in them
Fuck, here we go again

You look just like Captain Hook

Land ho!
Ah, very funny

That's ho!
If it's shit it's for me, for me

Do you know what is it?
An old print

Do you know who made it?
No

Me neither. But it's
worth a fortune

But it's all fucked out

It's a museum piece.
This must be...

...one of those famous classics

From those times when guys
painted well. It must be a Murillo...

...or one of those

Sure. Someone had to paint it

Why do this always happen to us?
Because we are a couple of jerks

We are rude, we are uncultivated,
I didn't even pass the junior high

You are an ignorant
Look who's talking. What can you do?

A lot of things. That Italian really
liked the way I sucked him

That bastard? I forbade you to do
that again. Don't you see what he wants?

He wants us to cross the border
with this little picture

And tomorrow, at the other side,
he forgets all about as

Why didn't he do this?
Because the police have a file on him

Yes, sure

He arrives to the border, they
caught the picture and he goes to jail

What a life!
What strange things happen to us!

You've got your phone, right?
Yes

And you've also got Bernabe's
Bernabe?

The cop
The one who touched my ass?

Yes, call him
Sure?

Wait!
Shit!

How will you ask for him?

Well, may I speak
to captain Bernabe?

He is just a little cop
Just a cop? Shit

Is this the police station?

Mr. Bernabe?
Who is calling?

A citizen
Just a second, Your Highness

Mr. Bernabe, this is Gina, from
top lees, remember me?

Quiet, quiet
What is the matter? You seem serious

I'm working. What do you want?
What do we want?

It's very important for him to be
at the hotel Tropicana tomorrow at 9:30

We're going to have a four show?
Just say it!

It's very important for you to
be at 10 o'clock...

No, at 9:30!
Be at 9:30 at the Hotel Tropicana

What for? That's not my area

Doesn't matter. You have to be there
Why? Tina crime be committed?

A crime? A bunch of crimes

I'm your best student, am I not?
I'm fucking good

We had a lot of work to do

The same night we had the date
of the Flamingo...

...and I almost forgot. Our client
showed up. His face looked familiar

We dedicated him the best
part of our show

The final part. The one that
justify our name: Red Silk

Hi, sweetheart
Hi, dearies

Would you like a glass of drink?
-Yes, sure

A bottle of champagne Don Perignon

Do you come here often?
Every night

How do you like our show?

-Artistically speaking, a piece of shit
Don't you like it?

Well, it was very sexy

What do you do in life, honey?

Policeman
Policeman?

I don't believe you!

And I want to talk
seriously with you too

Well, if you want to talk
seriously with us...

We'd better do it in a more
private place

Do you think so?
All right

I knew from the first moment that
Fran wasn't a regular customer

And that he was lying
about being a cop

But he just was so good
looking, so we took him home

Another bottle, Mariano!

He offered us a strange job

We had to steal a package from
one of Ka|man's car

He never gave us the details
because he got so drunk...

...that fell sleep in our arms

What a disaster!

Good morning, what can I get you?
For the lady, a cup of tea

Don't listen to her, a whisky
No, a cup of tea or you'll get too silly

But I'd like a glass of whisky, please
And you?

Another whisky

I don't see the cop

What if he doesn't show up?

You'll see, he'll show up

I like foreign countries!

What about it? There's no
place like home

Were at 30 minutes from home
Yes, but it's still a foreign country

That man plays very nice!

What a beauty!

Thank you, miss

Oh, fuck!
Holy shit!

Here I am, Matias
Garibaldi, the famous piano player

Wasn't it Grunebaldi?

Grunebaldi as a painter,
Garibaldi as a pianist

And as a fucker?
As a fucker, Fitipaldi

May I sit down?
Yes, of course

Did you bring the things?
Yes, yes

Everything?
Everything. Did you bring the photos?

What ignorance! Photos need to
polish and need to be touched up

Have you heard?
When could we see them?

In a couple of months

You brought everything, don't you?
Yes, yes

Everything?
Everything

Where is it?
Right there

Go to get it. Where are you going?
For the things

Nice place here. Foreign
countries are great

What's the matter with your hand?
What? This? It's a friend of mine

Do you have friends outside?
All over the world

Your things
Let's see

What's the matter with
your friend?

What about her hand?
She's got a silly hand

What the fuck is going on here?

Dear chief BernabÃ©!
Caro amico!

Come to my arms!

I'll have to arrest you. This
time you've gone too far

What can I do? This is the fifth
time and he's always so kind

So kind.
This time you've gone too far

This miserable painting...
Yes, miserable but very valuable

Ciao
What about us?

Yes, what about us?

Be to the police station tomorrow
to sign the report and we'll see

My dear friend, couldn't we share
the money and forget all about it?

Impossible, Garibaldi

How much is it worth?
About one million dollars

Oh, my God, mamma mia!

And I'm going to run my
tongue down your back

Slowly all the way
down to your ass...

...and when I get to your ass,
I'm going to stick my finger in it

Come on, you say something

I'm going to suck your cock

Who is it?
The police

-What?
The chief Bernabe

Mr. Bernabe!

He hang up What a jerk you are!

And you? You slot!

Enough, stop it!

Stop it. Stop it

Didn't you hear the bell?
I didn't hear anything

It's two o'clock, time to
sleep. We'll continue tomorrow

We'll continue tomorrow

I was having a good time. Anyway
I have here my Macario

My little thing, Macario
wants to play?

A little kiss. Let me see
your dicky

And your tongue? My Macario

I had my Macario as well

And he's hard, hard and
so beautiful

Go to sleep

And I don't know
why you are upset

It is in the show that
we get really hot

Fucking in public.
We have to reserve energy

What's wrong?
I had a strange dream

I dreamt I was giving Macario hard
and he had the biggest dick I've ever seen

Keep blowing and don't leave
the poor thing halfway

Macario, what a cock you have

It's pink at the top

No, I can't receive you know.
We're sleeping

But I'm at your door
Can't it wait till tomorrow evening?

No, impossible, it's very urgent
Okay, come inside

But I'm already inside

Come in, then
Good morning

How come you're back in
our lives?

Now I can give you the details

You have to steal that
package from Ka|man's car

And we'll share
What the hell are we going to share?

Half of what Kalman
will pay for it

Half? Half of how much?
200.000 dollars

And why should we help
you when we can do the...

...job ourselves and skip
the sharing part?

Because if you don't help me,
I'll send you to prison

You're a policeman again, eh?

I don't give a shit if you
believe me or not

I never lie
Just when you talk, sweetheart!

You've got two options
Which one?

To give you all the money or
just half of it

Either you take the hundred grand...
What a generous guy!

And tell me what's the other option

That you spend the rest of
your like in a sinister cell

I'll tell you what you have to do

You have to go to Ka|man's place...

...give him the package,
it's a video tape, I think,

...and he'll give you an envelope
with the two hundred thousand dollars

Are you sure about it?

Very sure
And then, what?

I'll be waiting in the car...

...we'll get across the border.
and there we'll get the money...

...and you go your way and
I'll go mine

Gina, isn't that a great idea?
A marvelous idea

Look, he's hard
Oh, let me see...

Come on

Please, something
terrible has happened

My friend's panties
are broken

And we can't go to the
governor's party without panties

Just a minute

What's up?
My friend panties are broken

Can we come and fix it?

-Yes, sure, come in
What an angel!

This way, please

Sorry, wait here
Okay

Is this the ladies room?
Yes, right there

Hey, could you give me a hand?

Put your finger right here, please

Mariano, listen, you have to
take the Ka|man's car right away

Which one is it?
What do you mean? You don't know?

No
You wrote the note yourself, you stupid

Oh, yes
Thank you, you got a marvelous finger

How stupid of me!
I forgot to pee

Don't you like it? Millionaires
would pay fortunes to see this

This is golden rain
Do you like it?

Where have you been?
You're losing your facs

Did you get it?
Of course

Hey, wait

Once again, Red Silk has done it

The only thing left is to call
the guy and give him the package

What's the number?

Wait!
What is it?

I was thinking it's strange that
someone would give us all that money...

...for such a simple job like
that. I can't believe it

So I won't call?
Wait...

Let's see the pros
and the cons

What the hell do you mean?

In a way it's best not to call,

but we could lose a lot of money

Why?

Because we are maybe losing
the opportunity of our lives

I won't call, then

I don't know what to say

It's a matter of quid pro quo

And who's that?
Don't be a nut head!

I don't call, then
No, no, yes, yes. Call, call, call now

How was the number?
223 25 24

Come on, call now

Wait!
What's now?

Wait. I'm in a fucking dilemma.
Can't you see?

Give me a break!
You are irresponsible

We're playing with millions
I know

My head is fucked up. I don't know
if it's better to call and sep the money...

...or don't call right now

Yes, that's what we'll do
What?

We are going home

Why home?

Because we have to see what's
in the mysterious package

You never let me use
this phone

You are an asshole

Son of a bitch!

No one told us that Kalman was the
main character in this movie

So Kalman is a murderer

And someone is blackmailing him

Who cares is blackmailing him, he's
a son of a bitch, don't you see?

Yes, but we can squeeze
him for much more

Get a tape, we'll do a
copy of this

Kalman is very rich

He has to pay a fortune

We were so furious that we
decided to fuck him

Leave him without money and
give the tape to our friend Bernabe

What Kalman did with that girl...

...he would pay for

May I speak with Mr. Bernabe, please?

Come on, talk to him,
you know him better

Mr. Bernabe, we are Red Silk

Yes, listen. We have a client and...

...soon he'll be your client

And he had committed a crime

An important criminal like
Jack the Ripper...

...or DrÃ©cula
Are you sure?

Yes, sure, you have to get
him, tomorrow night

His name is Kalman, we'll leave him
knocked out already for you to get him

And if you are a good boy...

No, we are expecting
a good reward

For our act of service and if you
are a good boy we'll give you a blow job

Like last January, remember?

He hang LIP

Help! Help!

Help, please! Help me!

Good morning, madam

Don't worry, you'll soon
be free

Doors open easily
these days

This is beautiful! Just
like Blackingham Palace

Buckingham
That's just what I've said

Aw

Be careful with that.
The devil always loads them

Hey!
What?

You're not holding it well
Why?

I've seen it in the movies.
The hold it this way

Holy shit!

What the fuck are you doing?

Look at all these video tapes

There's nothing like having money

Look it there, a telescope, a soccer
game, everything I like

Who cares a tape of vide?
We're going to steal 200.000 dollars

Listen, I can wait here

What's that?
How should I know?

Rich people usually have
nightmares

Surely he has vampires, the
place is full of garlic

I don't like that at all
What?

The garlic

Who are you? What do you want?
Don't hurt me, please

Listen, mother fucker

If you want money
I have nothing

Bastard! Where do you
hide the checks? Come on

We want 200.000 dollars!
Where's the money?

Son of a bitch!
Bastard, tell me where are the checks

Come on!

So you are blackmailing me.
Give me the tape first

Asshole, I'm gonna cut your balls off
We want all your money

Give me the tape and I'll
Pay V0â€˜-I

I feel like cutting your balls off

And I will if you don't tell
us where is the money

Tell us where is the money

Tell us!
What have I done?

You son of a bitch
You've got three seconds to tell us

Don't hurt me, please

One,...
What have I done?

...two,..
Speak, you bastard!

...and...

I'll give you 300.000 dollars!

You're going to pay for all your
crimes if you don't give us the money

Wait, here!

Let me alone. Let me live!

Vargas! Vargas!
Help me!

I left the credit cards and
the checks for you. Vargas

Check out all these cards!

Vargas! Vargas!

Vargas, what's going on?

We have to save her
Ok. But she's a bitch like all the others

There's no one here!

She's probably a ghost
You're the only ghost around here

Mother fuckers!
Bastards!

This bastard is rich!

He may have five dollars
in each account

What we got from the
credit cards was alright

But not enough

So we decided to try
with the checks

What music is this?

What are you saying?
What are you listening to?

Rumbas, great!

In a couple of hours we
got nearly half a million dollars

So I decided the best thing
to do was to leave the country,

even thought Gina didn't
like the idea

Don't you feel sorry leaving?
We had enjoyed this house

Now we are rich and we'll be
the queen of Saba?

But we had a lot of fun.
We own the rent and the phone

But now we are millionaires
we could pay it

Wait a second
What?

I forgot something
What?

Macario
Who is Macario?

It's my teddy bear
I'll buy you a real bear

I want Macario.
Wait a minute

Hurry up, we have 35 miles
to the border

It's not my fault, I didn't
put it there

We're rich, where should we go?
To the Caiman Islands

The Caiman Islands?
Is that dangerous?

No, not more than any
other places

Is it far?
If you swim, yes

But we'll take a flight
Caiman Islands

How exotic! Beautiful!

I'm going to fuck every
guy I meet there

Now you like men?
If they're exotic and strange...

You didn't believe all
our fantasy, ah?

Don't worry, we're still
alive and still strong

Some things in our
story are true...

...others aren't,
we just wanted to get you horny...

...and wake your interest
in us

Afer all, we are love girls

And we are still at the
Flamingo club

If you want to meet us
just send your request by mail

Red Silk will
contact you
