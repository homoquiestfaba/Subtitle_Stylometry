[magical, upbeat music playing]

Master Geppetto made Pinocchio,</i>

<i>he had already lost a son.</i>

<i>Now this was quite a few years
before my time,</i>

<i>but I learnt the story.</i>

<i>And then it became my story.</i>

<i>Geppetto lost Carlo during the Great War.</i>

<i>They'd been together only ten years.</i>

<i>But it was as if Carlo had taken
the old man's life with him.</i>



Whoa. [grunts]

[engines whir]


[mimics airplane engine]

Papa! Papa!
[Geppetto] Yes?

Guess what I saw?
[Geppetto] What?

Guess!
I've no idea.

[Carlo] I saw some planes!
[Geppetto] Oh, did you? Good.

What is it you're making this time, Papa?
[Geppetto] Guess!

A soldier? A magician? A witch?
No. [chuckles]

No! No, no, no, no, no,
you have to wait and see, Carlo!

All good things require patience.
[chuckles]

Huh.


In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

And the old witch
warned the little hedgehog,

"Do not tell lies,
or your nose will grow and grow

up to here!"

[Geppetto chuckles]
[Carlo laughs]

His nose would grow?

are found out immediately

because they are like long noses,

visible to all but the teller of the lie.

And the more you lie, the more it grows!

[both laugh]

Sing me Mama's song so I can sleep.
Please, Papa?

[Geppetto chuckles] All right.

[clears throat]

<i>â™ª My son, my son â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You are my shining sun</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª My moon â™ª</i>

Higher, Papa! Higher!
<i>- â™ª My stars â™ª</i>


<i>- â™ª My clear blue daylight sky â™ª</i>
[Carlo laughs]

<i>â™ª And if you looked at me today
My heart would heal so fast â™ª</i>

Try it.

[pig oinks]
[bell jingles]

<i>- â™ª And if you held me right away, I'd be â™ª</i>
[Geppetto] Thank you, ladies.

<i>â™ª Complete at last â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At last</i> â™ª

For you. [chuckles]
[gasps]

For me?
<i>â™ª You are my favorite</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Favorite thing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Better than sunset, better than spring</i> â™ª

<i>- â™ª You bring me joy</i> â™ª
[indistinct chatter]

<i>â™ª You make me sing in the morning â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the evening too â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You are everything to me</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª And I love you</i> â™ª

Pull, Carlo! Pull!

<i>- â™ª My son</i> â™ª
Magnificent job, Geppetto.

<i>- â™ª My son â™ª</i>
Thank you.

<i>- â™ª You are my golden sun...</i> â™ª
[grunts]

Watch out, Carlo!

another must grow.

How about this one?

No, no, no, no, Carlo.

It has to be perfect. Complete!

See?

This one's missing some of its scales.

<i>â™ª My son â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My son</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª You are</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª My shining sun</i> â™ª

[song ends]

[Geppetto sighs]

Good night, Papa.

Good night, my son.



We're going to church first, right?
[Geppetto] Oh, yes. Yes.

[gentle, cheerful music playing]

Hello there, little dog!

[church bells ring]
[indistinct chatter]

<i>Buongiorno, Geppetto.</i>

Morning!
Morning.

Master Geppetto,
you gonna finish the crucifix today?

We're gonna do our best.

Ladies.
[both] Aw, such a perfectionist.

[man grunts]

A model Italian citizen.

And such a good father.

[horseshoe sizzles]

Carlo, nice shoes. Catch!

Thank you, sir!

Good morning.
[Carlo] Hi!

[chuckles] <i>Buongiorno.</i>
[Geppetto] <i>Buongiorno, Dottore!</i>

[church bell ringing]

Ah, Carlo.

Geppetto.

[clears throat]

Yes...

[Carlo] It looks great, Papa.
Oh.

Is it almost time to go home?

Almost!

Send up a little more red for me, Carlo.
[thunder rumbles]


Oh! I forgot to show you what I found.

What is it, my boy?

You'll see.

Ta-da!
[chuckles]

The perfect pine cone.

It still has all its scales!

I thought I could plant it myself
and watch the tree grow.

And then carve toys for myself.
Like you do.

as any boy ever had, Carlo.

[Carlo grunts]


Isn't it?


What's that sound, Papa? Is it a plane?

Gather the tools.

Quickly.

We'll go home to a warm fire and hot soup.

Could we have some hot chocolate too?
Sure. Sure.

It seems like a hot chocolate sort of day,
doesn't it?

Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fine.

Papa! What is it?

Nothing. I'm sure it's nothing but...

Oh, wait. My pine cone!

[distant explosion]


little town was not even a target.</i>

[airplane engines whirring]

were heading back to base</i>

<i>and simply let go of their bombs
to make their ballasts lighter.</i>

[bomb whistling]

[thunder rumbles]

[airplane engine whirs]


Carlo!

[suspenseful music playing]

Ah!





No...

Carlo.


[melancholic music playing]

[melancholic music continues]



And that was that.</i>

<i>He worked very little. He ate even less.</i>

<i>And the church's crucifix
remained unfinished.</i>

[sighs]
[narrator] <i>The years passed.</i>

<i>The world moved on...</i>

<i>but Geppetto did not.</i>



[cheerful music playing]

<i>You see, I was a writer.</i>

<i>And for years, I'd been looking
for the ideal conditions to set</i>

<i>my illustrious,
fascinating life story to paper.</i>

<i>Until, at long last,</i>

<i>I found it.</i>



<i>Home.</i>

Ah.

And what a tale it would be.</i>

<i>I had lived
in a barrister's fireplace in Sardinia,</i>

<i>sailed on the Adriatic in a fishing boat,</i>

<i>nested oneÂ Perugian winter
with an acclaimed sculptor.</i>

Stridulations of My Youth

<i>by Sebastian J. Cricket.</i>


[Geppetto weeps]

I dreamed you were
right back here with me.

My son.

[thunder rumbles]

Oh dear.

If only I could have you back. [weeps]

I am so sorry.

And it moved me.</i>

<i>And it turns out
that I wasn't the only one watching him.</i>

<i>In my many wanderings on this earth,</i>

<i>I've learned that there are old spirits
living in the mountains, in the forests,</i>

<i>who rarely involve themselves
in the human world.</i>

<i>But on occasion, they do.</i>



With me!

Why won't you listen to my prayers?
[thunder rumbles]

[Geppetto sobs] Why?

[Cricket sighs]

Where were we?

Ah yes. Perug...

[pounding]
Whoa!

What in my antennae?

[pounding]
[grunts]



Wha... Hey!

...out of this accursed pine!


Whoa! Ah! [grunts]

[Geppetto grunting]

[thunder rumbles]

[intense, dramatic music playing]

[Geppetto panting]




What on earth?!
[Geppetto grunts]

No!

Ah! Ooh! Yah!
[cuckoo clock chimes]

It's a house of horrors!



[groans]
[thunder rumbles]

Ah!



Ah!






[thunder rumbles]

[mysterious music playing]






[thunder rumbles]

[grunts, blows]



Huh? [mumbles]

I... I will finish you tomorrow.

Yes, tomorrow.



Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

Hey! Get away from there. Go away!

Bugger off.

No, no, no, no, no, no. This is my home!

No trespassing. Go! Go! Go! Go!

Get away from here. Go away! Go away!

Yes, that's right.

[spirit chirps]

[mystical music playing]




may you rise with the sun
and walk the earth.

This is my home we're talking about.

May I ask, who on earth are you?


A guardian.

I care for the little things...
[Geppetto snoring]

...the forgotten things,

the lost ones.

Well, I am
Sebastian J. Cricket, homeowner.

And I have every right to be consulted
about your schemes and machinations

regarding my property.

in the heart of the wooden boy,

perhaps you can help me.

Help you what?

To watch over him.

Guide him to be good.

I'm not a governess, madam.

I'm a novelist, a raconteur,

currently immersed in writing my memoirs.

you get what you give.

Take on this responsibility,
and I will grant you one wish.

And that could be anything?

Anything at all?

The publication of my book?

Fame? Fortune?


Oh.

Maybe I can help. I'll try my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.



we shall call you Pinocchio.

May you rise with the sun

and wander the earth...

Ah!



to that poor heartbroken man.

Be his son.

Fill his days with light
so he'll never be alone.





Ah.



Huh.




[distant glass shatters]
[gasps]


[boy laughs]
[footsteps]


Who goes there?


I... I have a weapon!

[ladder creaking]

[curious, suspenseful music playing]


[thud]
Wha...

Good morning, Papa!


What is this? What kind of sorcery?

You wanted me to live.
You asked for me to live.

Who... Who are you?

My name is Pinocchio!

I'm your son!

You are not my son! Don't come near me!

The boy's telling the truth,
Master Geppetto!


Ah! [grunts]


Ugh. [gasps]

Ah!

[mysterious music plays]


Wow!

Ah! Huh?

What is this?

[gasps]
[glass shatters]

<i>â™ª All the things my eyes can see â™ª</i>

[panting]
[banging on doors]

What is wrong with you?




[door unlocks]


I, uh...

[church bells ringing]

Just stay here. Don't come out.

[door closes]

Time for church.

[Pinocchio] Church? I wanna go to church.
<i>- </i>Stay there.

[Pinocchio] Church! Church!
Do you understand?

Church! Church! Church! Church!

Church!

No, no, he told you to stay.

I'm going to church! I'm going to church!
No, no, no! Please, stop!

You must obey your papa.

Obey?

To do as you're told!

But I don't want to obey!

Well... [clears throat]

...you must try your best,
and that's the best anybody can do.

<i>â™ª My dear father... â™ª</i>

[screams]
[Pinocchio] I'm going to church!

I'm going to church! [hums]


[upbeat, adventurous music playing]

Whoa!

[church bells ringing]
Hi!

Okay, bye!

Hmm.


Uh, uh, ah!

[organ music playing]

[priest chants in Latin]

[congregation chants in Latin]

[priest chants in Latin]

[congregation chants in Latin]


[priest chants in Latin]
[boy] Look, Father, over there!

What is that?

[congregation gasps]

Papa!

[gasps]
[woman] It speaks!

[people mutter]
[woman speaks Italian]

[in English] Papa! Papa! Over here!


It's me!

I came to church.

It's a demon!
[gasps] Witchcraft!

<i>Malocchio!</i>

Pinocchio.

No! No, please!

It's... It's a puppet
to... to entertain! [chuckles]

If he's a puppet, where are his strings?

That's true. Who controls you, wooden boy?

Of course, I control him...

Who controls you?

[muffled speech]
[congregation muttering]

No one talks to the Podesta like that.

He... He's a puppet. Just a puppet!

No, I'm not. I'm made
of flesh and bone and meaty bits!

I'm a real boy! [gasps]
[woman screams]

A monster!
[woman in Italian] Demon!

[woman 2 in English] It's an abomination.
[crowd chattering]

[woman 2] This is the work of the devil!
[priest pounds on podium] Enough!

This is a house of God.

You drunken fool!

You carving this... this thing

while our blessed Christ
hangs unfinished all these years?

Take that unholy thing away.
Take it away! Now!

[man yells in Italian]
[crowd clamors]

[in English] Yes. Yes, Padre.

[woman 3] Shame on you, Geppetto!
[man] Burn him!

So sorry.
Chop him up!

[man 2] Oh <i>Dio mio.</i>
Sorry, sorry.

[blows raspberry]
He'll be fine.

[woman 4] Curse you, Geppetto!
[woman 5]Â The Lord will punish him!

[crowd clamoring]
[woman 6] Get out!

<i>â™ª Yo dee lo dee
Lo dee lo dee lo dee lee</i> â™ª

Stop fidgeting, please.
Hello!


Carlo never acted like this. [groans]

Papa, why did my nose grow today?

You lied, Pinocchio,

and a lie is plain to see
as your nose and...

And the more you lie, the more it grows.

Is that it?
That...

[knocking at door]
Yes, that's it.

[thunder crashes]

[bike bell rings]

[Geppetto] There you go.
[priest] Chocolate.

[Geppetto chuckles]
Thank you, Geppetto.

We appreciate your hospitality.

Candlewick, go sit by the fire.

We are here to talk about
the incident at the church today.

The community was startled
by your creation.

As Podesta,

I must ensure that this puppet of yours
poses no threat to our community.

Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

Oh! Is that

hot chocolate?

You're a puppet!
You've never eaten anything in your life!

Oh! Oh, that must be why I'm so hungry!

Oh, I'm starving, Papa.
I'm starving to death!

You are not!

Now go sit by the fire
and let me talk to our guests.

But I don't want to! I want hot chocolate!

Please, Papa. Please! Please! Please!
[Geppetto] There, there now.

Here you go.

Oh boy! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

Yes. Yes, Pinocchio.
Go... Go warm your feet by the fire.

Obey your papa.

Oh yes, I will obey if I get chocolate.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

He really is a charming boy.

Podesta watches overÂ the town's
moral well-being, you understand?

His authority cannot be questioned...

And I won't be mocked!

You have my word.

[growls]
[hisses]

[Podesta] So, what about this wooden boy?
Ah.

Will you let him run wild
through town all day?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll keep him locked up!

Right here in the house.

I won't be locked up.

I'll smash the windows out, I will.

This abnormal boy lacks discipline.

But he seems strong, sturdy,
made of good Italian pine.

[thunder rumbles]
[Geppetto] Oh, very good pine, yes.

Not perfect, you see,
but, uh, he means well.

Hey. Try to get closer to the fire
to get warm.


Look at my boy, Candlewick.

Yes. Yes.

A model fascist youth.

Proud and brave.

Virile, like his father.

And his teeth, perfect teeth.
And no sign of jaundice.


My feet feel hot, like chocolate.

Look!

Ah! What?! [mumbles]

Fire! My house is on fire!

[screams]
[Pinocchio laughs] Yes! Look at me!

Look! I'm on fire! Yay!

Aw. Look what you did, Papa.
You've ruined the nice light on my feet.

This is what you get
with an undisciplined mind.

You must send this child to school.

To school? Pinocchio?

Yes. Tomorrow.

School. [chuckles]

[thunder rumbles]

Oh, what a day. What a day.

Oh, what a day. What a day.

[Geppetto chuckles]

Time for bed.

You know, Papa, I like my old legs.
And I like them on fire.

Pinocchio, if you go to sleep,

I'll make you a new pair of legs
in the morning.

Just like the old ones?


Better? Can I have cricket legs, Papa?
Can you make me four of them?


Two will do. [sighs]

Good night, Papa.

Good night, my...

Good night, Pinocchio.

Sebastian?



Yes, Pinocchio?

Who's Carlo?

Carlo was a boy.

Geppetto lost him many years ago.

Where did he put him?
How can you lose a whole person?

I mean, he... he died, Pinocchio.

He's no longer alive.

Is that a bad thing?

Yes. It's a great burden
for a father to lose a child so young.

What's a burden?

It's something painful you must carry

even though it hurts you very much.


<i>I had so much to say.</i>

<i>Not about my own life, for a change,</i>

<i>but about imperfect fathers
and imperfect sons.</i>

<i>And about loss and love.</i>


at least,</i>

<i>we were, all of us, blissfully oblivious.</i>


These legs are much, much, much,
<i>much</i> better than the old ones!

Ha! Look at me! I can walk backwards. Hup!

And... And jump forwards!

Hup!

I couldn't do it before!
Huh? [groans]

Ooh, Papa! Can you see this?
He looks just like me.

[monkey yelps]

What is that?



Hurry up. Hurry up.

Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
I love these new legs, Papa.

Can we go to the carnival?
[monkey] Hmm.

Perhaps, Pinocchio. Perhaps.

Right now we have work to do.

[Pinocchio] Work? I love work!
[monkey] Hmm.


No more questions.




[mischievous music playing]

[monkey chattering]

[man speaks Italian]

[man 2 speaks Italian]

[in English] Stupid monkey!
[grunts]

[grunts]
[man 3] Whoa!

[panting]
[speaking Italian]

[monkey chattering]


[knocking at door]

[man grunts]

[knocking at door]

[man in English] I'm coming!

What is it? What are you doing here?

Ah! [whimpers]

I told you to put up posters
and draw big crowds.

This carnival is going to pot! And you?!

Can you not see
how desperate the situation is?


A what?


[blows raspberry]

A living puppet? Are you absolutely sure?


This could get us to the top again!

This could make us kings again!

<i>â™ª We were a king once â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can we be king twice? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We were bathing in milk
Played for diamonds and silk â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Once â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But we want it twice! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My show was a magnet
For the crowd â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No one could resist Volpe's crown â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now the little ones â™ª</i>

[growls]
[yelps]

<i>â™ª Now the married ones â™ª</i>

Hey! [speaks Italian]
<i>- â™ª Prefer Garbo, Gardel, Valentino â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª La voce di Caruso â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Jazz on the radio â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª You were the kings once â™ª</i>
[monkey screams]

<i>â™ª Mon dieu, was it nice! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You were knights of the night
Full of glory and might once â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So let's get it twice! â™ª</i>



<i>- â™ª Believe in you! â™ª
â™ª We were the kings once â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Believe in me! â™ª</i>

[song ends]

[grunts]
[Geppetto] Now let it down.

More. That's it. That's it.

Just a little more. Stop.

There we go.


Very good, child. Very good.

Papa, there's something
I don't understand.

What is it, Pinocchio?

Everybody likes <i>him</i>.

Who?

Him.

Huh?
They were all singing to him.

He's made of wood too.

Why do they like <i>him</i> and not me?

Come here, Pinocchio.


People are sometimes
afraid of things they don't know,

but they'll get to know you
and like you, and for that, uh...

Are you ready for school?

Then I have something
I'd like to give you.

Ta-da!


I love it, Papa!

I love it! I love it! I love it!

What is it?

It is a schoolbook.

A very special schoolbook.

One which belonged to a very special boy.

Carlo, the boy you lost?

Uh-huh.

Was he a very good boy, Papa?

Yes, he was.

And you loved him very much?

I did.

I... I do.

Then I will be just like Carlo!

I will obey and go to school,
and I'll be the very, very best

at... whatever they do there.

I'll make you proud!

<i>â™ª Off to school, off to school â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Going to school, going to school
Off to school I go â™ª</i>

Hup! Hup!

Hup! Hup!

He exists!

Oh, this dream, this wonder exists!

You beautiful, brilliant baboon!
[grunts]

I must have him.

Whoa!
[bell ringing]

<i>â™ª Off to school, off to school
Going to school, going to school â™ª</i>

Hup!

School! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

What do you learn in school, Mr. Cricket?
You'll learn reading and writing.

You learn the multiplication tables!

What's the <i>mulplitication</i> tables?

Well, say you have four carts,
each with, uh, 27 apples.

I don't care what the table says.
I have no apples, and I refuse to lie!

Oh, no. It's just math!

So you multiply the four and the seven...
four past seven? And you get...

I get confused.

I don't think
I like school anymore, Sebastian.

Ah! We have found him!

Look, Spazzatura!Â Our miracle!

Our sensation!
[Pinocchio] Hey, watch it!

Our star!

Who? Me?

Yes, <i>mon Ã©toile</i>!

I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen!

Come partake in
the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life

as the star of my puppet show!

Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

You promised your papa
you would go to school! [gasps]

Oh, yeah.
I promised my papa I'd go to school.

See? He gave me Carlo's book.

Carlo's book? Yes! Yes!

A classical, canonical work.

I can see
you're intrinsically an intellectual!

But then now, book learning cannot compare
to witnessing the wide world

with one's own eyes
from atop the glorious stage.

[Pinocchio] Wow.
[Spazzatura screeches]

You shall seeÂ all
of the nations of the earth for yourself

as they bow at your feet.

My brand-new feet!

No! No, wait!

You have to go to school!

Oh, can we do it tomorrow?

Regretfully, no.

For today's the only day

that our cacophonous carnival
will visit your vicinity,

but if you must go to school,
then you must go to school.

Come, Spazzatura.

We must find someone else

to eat all our ice cream
and popcorn and hot chocolate.

Hot chocolate?
Oh no. [screams]


All the hot chocolate you can drink
and all the games you can play.

Oh boy, oh boy!

Maybe it'll be okay
if I'm a little bit late for school?

Yeah, perfectly fine.
No one will even notice.

Don't listen to him, Pinocchio! [screams]

Ah, we have
one last detail to take care of.

Whoa!

Sign here, here, and here. Need a pen?

No, Pinocchio! Don't! [grunts]
[Spazzatura screeches]

[Cricket groans]
[squealing]


Perfect! I will now make you
burn bright like a star!

Follow me, my boy!

[Cricket grunts]
[Spazzatura laughs]

Oh, the pain.

Life is such hideous pain.

would you mind coming down?

Oh, at last!

Our savior is restored.

[curious music playing]

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Your boy didn't show up at school today.

But he left this morning.
I... I sent him there.

Obviously, the puppet
is quite a dissident.

An independent thinker, I'd say.

Uh, uh, uh, yes.
You better look for him.

I trust we will see
the wooden boy tomorrow at school.

Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

[carnival music playing]

Ah!

Boy, the carnival sure is grand.

How about some more popcorn?

another bite, Mr. Diavolo.



I better get going to school, I guess.

Stay a while, Pinocchio.
[Volpe laughs]

I am sorry to keep you waiting,
my little puppet.

I don't like being called a puppet.

My boy.Â Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit!</i>

The tops! Lift your arm.

Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

But I thought it was best
to be a normal boy.

Oh, no, no, no. People love puppets.

Like Il Diavolo, Columbina, Punchinello.

Of course, there's but one puppet
who is king of them all!

Oh boy, I'd like to meet that guy.

Pinocchio!

Wait. That's me!

That's right. You are a wonder! A miracle.

They'll love you!

Who?

<i>Les Idiots!</i>

The wonderful children of the world!

Lift your leg. Everyone shall love you
and call your name.

Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
[screams]

Pinocchio, the living puppet!

[scattered applause]


Oh. [chuckles]

[crowd gasps]

A one and a two and...

[cheerful music plays]

<i>â™ª My gum, my gum â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I pop my bubble gum â™ª</i>
[crowd] Yeah!

<i>â™ª I scream â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I cry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For ice cream and for pie</i> â™ª

Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
[dog barks]

[pensive music playing]

Pinocchio!

No.

Carlo's book.

What?

Over there. [groans]

[cheerful music playing]

That song. How could he know that song?

[Pinocchio] <i>â™ª I'm free as the wind â™ª</i>
[Cricket groans]


One nightmare after another.


<i>â™ª Your son, your son
Is happy to have... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fun! â™ª</i>

[kids cheering] Yay! Pinocchio!


And all those treats are
for sale at the carnival.

Thank you!

Pinocchio? What's all this?

What are you doing?

Papa!

I'm a star, Papa! A star!

They love me! They accept me!
Oh, what are you...

You were supposed to be at school.

And how do you know that song anyway?


You simian simpleton!

[Spazzatura choking]

My star!
[Spazzatura screams]

Where is my star?

[kids cheering]
Thank you. Thank you.

Oh, you're very kind.

You ruined Carlo's book,
and you didn't go to school! Why?

You promised me
you would behave like... like... like...


Yes.

I was going to, Papa, but... but...

Yes, Pinocchio. What?

Ten bandits came out
of the bushes and took...

[kids gasp]

...out of the bushes,
and they took the book.

Oh, I... I see.

And then what happened?

They had an axe,
and they wanted chocolate.

Hot chocolate!

Pinocchio, you shouldn't lie to me.

I am your papa!

But I'm telling the truth!
[whispering in Italian]

[in English]
Then why is your nose growing?

It's not!
[kids gasp]

Lies, lies, and more lies!

I am not lying!

[kids gasp]


[kids cheering]
[gasps]

Go away!

This is not a spectacle!

But it is!

Unhand my <i>carissimo</i>, you carousing...

kleptomaniac!

Do not touch him!

I made him!

And I discovered him!

He's not your puppet. He's mine!
[Pinocchio] Oh!

Perhaps we should...


He's an actor. My actor.
[Pinocchio giggling]

Give him to me!


[laughs]
Oh dear.

[grunts]
[suspenseful music swells]

That was so much fun, Papa!

No!
[truck horn blares]


[Geppetto panting]

Pinocchio.

He came out of nowhere!

That's what happens
when you let your children run wild!


<i>That much was apparent
to any astute observer.</i>

<i>But little did I know
that death was not the end.</i>

<i>â™ª Thou art gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thy life hast fled</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª All shall now bewail thee dead</i> â™ª

Did you hear that?
[Pinocchio gasps] Who's there?

I thought he was dead.
He is dead. I saw the paperwork myself.

<i>- â™ª No more flesh</i> â™ª
[Pinocchio] Hello?

<i>â™ª And no more bone â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª No more trouble to bemoan â™ª</i>
[time clock dings]

All right. So, where were we?

Whose deal?

Mine, right?

All right, boys, ante up.

What's the limit again?
[rabbit] Twenty's the limit, ya mook.

You got something under there, don't ya?

[rabbit 2] Probably has a <i>leibedik</i> six.

[rabbit 3 laughs] Very funny.
[gasps] Are you playing a game?

Flush! [laughs]
I wanna play! Please, please,Â can I play?

What part of dead
don't you understand, <i>schmendrick</i>?

It's boring in there. I hate being dead.
[gong sounds]

Uh-oh, now you did it.

What's that?

Processing.

Go see the boss, kid.

Through there.

[gong sounds]
You'll see her.

Give me a freakin' ace, please.
[doors creak]

[rabbit 3 laughs]

[door creaking]



I feel as though you've been here before.

I am Pinocchio. I'm a boy.

And I think I'm... dead.


The wooden boy with the borrowed soul.

My sister's folly.

The sentimental fool.

She gave you life, Pinocchio,
when you were not supposed to have it.

No more than a chair or a table should.

As a result, you cannot truly, truly die.

Oh boy, oh boy!

And... And that's good, right?


nor will you ever be,
a real boy like Carlo.

The one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful, you see,

is how brief it is.

Oh.


many, many times.

This being one of them.

But they are not real deaths.

Just waiting periods.

There are rules, you see.

Despite my sister's disregard for them.

We will both have to wait
for the sand to run out.

You will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross

until the end of time.

And then, after that sand runs out?

every time.

I see.

Well, in that case,
I'd like to ask you one thing.



No.

No.

Ah, Pinocchio.

<i>Niente</i>. There's not much we can do.

I'm afraid the body is rigid.

Well, he's always been rigid.
He's made of wood.

Even if he's dead, I could still book him.

How dare you, sir!

Show some respect.

You show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings!

Gentlemen, please.

This is no time for your petty grievances.

[mumbling mockingly]

[chanting in Latin]

How do you intend
to dispose of the dead body?

A dead body? Where?
[gasps]

Pinocchio! You're alive!

He is immortal!

Long live the arts!

It's a miracle.

[Pinocchio panting]

Take it easy, my child.

Lean on me.

We're going home.

Uh, uh, uh. Wait a moment.
[chuckles]

I have a legally binding contract.

Signed by both artist and management.

He either performs,
or you owe me ten million lire!

Well, that's ridiculous.

It's just a smiling sun.

It's still his signature, is it not?

I drew that.

Ha ha!

I demand full restitution before the law,

including transportation,
transmutation, all the future represe...

Our country comes first.

This boy cannot be killed.

He's the ideal soldier.
Hmm?

He must be drafted
into the youth camps by law.

You will learn to fight,

and fire a weapon,
and be a real Italian boy.

Now we... we must go.

We truly must go.

We will all speak later, I am sure.

Not to me, sir. Speak to my lawyers!

[Geppetto sighs]

What... What a day. What a day!

A fun day!

What will we do?

Oh, don't worry, Papa.

I'll go to war. It sounds quite fun.

I can learn to fight
and fire a weapon and march like the...

No, Pinocchio.

War is not fun!

War is not good. War...

War took Carlo away from me.

Then I simply won't go.

But you have to go now. It's the law.

Even when it's something bad?

Yes, we all have to obey the law
whether we like it or not.

Why?

I don't have time or patience enough
to explain that to you. I... I...

I owe that man a fortune.

And you... you will be taken far away
and recruited into military youth camp.

And now... now look
what you've turned me into.

I made you to be like Carlo.

Why can't you be more like Carlo?

Because I'm not Carlo.

I don't wanna be like Carlo.

Carlo is...
Enough!

You are such a burden.

[melancholic music playing]

Oh.

[snoring softly]

His nose didn't grow.


his nose didn't grow.

That's how he really feels.

I don't want to be a burden.

I don't want to hurt Papa
and make him want to yell at me like that.

Oh, Pinocchio.

Sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else.

And they say things,

things they only think they mean
in the moment.

But with time, they learn that...

well, that they
never really meant it at all.

Do you understand?



Hey. Hey, where are you going?


Pinocchio, wha...Â what are you doing?
[Pinocchio] You'll see!

I'm going to the carnival.

That way, I can help Papa,
and I won't go to war.

I'll leave him a note
explaining everything.

No, Pinocchio, don't do this.

Oh, that's...


No! No!

Hmm.

No! No, don't do this!

You tell him that I will send him money.

And tell him I love him.

And I won't be a burden anymore.

No!




[opera music playing]



[pounding at door]

[grunts]
Huh?

[record scratches]
What is it?

What do you want in the middle of the...

My beloved star!

How can I be of assistance?

If I work for you,Â will you forget
the money you want from my papa?

Huh? [grunts]

Oh, absolutely, my dear boy.

And will you send him
my share of the profits?

Clear accounting all the way.

Fifty-fifty, right down the middle.

[Spazzatura grunts]

[Volpe chuckles]

[sighs] Oh.
[Volpe laughs]

Everybody up!
[Spazzatura chattering]

[indistinct murmuring]








Oh.

[grunts, groans]

The pain.


[Geppetto sighs]

Pinocchio. Son.

I just wanted to say...

Pinocchio!

Oh!

Little cricket.


He's gone! To the carnival!



Pinocchio!

Pinocchio!

[dramatic music playing]

[Cricket chirps]


Get! Get!


Oh.

How will I ever find him?

Oh, now you want to find him?

After all the things you said.
After you called him a burden!

A burden?!

Why are you so blind?

So absolutely blind!

The boy loves you.

He has much to learn,
but he loves you for who you are.

Would it kill you to do as much for him?

You should start acting like a father.
A real father!

Not an old stubborn goat who's so busy
moaning and crying about his losses...


...that he cannot see
the love he actually has!

I may be a bug, sir,

but I have a thing or two
to teach you about...

Hey! Where are you going?

After my son!

Excuse... If I may,
per... perhaps we should... Wait!

[sweet, soft music playing]


<i>â™ª Mio papa â™ª</i>
Wait! Wait! Wait!

<i>â™ª Time has come to say farewell â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For how long will I go? Is it far? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No one knows, no one can tell â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I am gone for a long, long time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll pack away a fine piece of shine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The sound of birds chirping with bells â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The smell of bread, a drop of wine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your memory, father of mine â™ª</i>

[cheering, applause]

<i>- â™ª Time has come to say farewell â™ª</i>
[groans]

<i>â™ª I am ready to go, going far â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Now I know it will be swell â™ª</i>

<i>Viva Benito Mussolini, nostro duce!</i>

<i>Viva! Viva! Viva!</i>

[dramatic music playing]


[boat horn blares]


Just one last stop.

Don't forget to send
my share of the money back home to Papa.

Oh, I wouldn't dream of forgetting.

See? Fifty-fifty...

minus expenses,
transportation, and promotion.

Huh?

Tomorrow we go
to a small town by the sea. Catania.

And there we will perform
for his excellency, <i>Il Duce.</i>

<i>Il Dolce?</i>


Our fearless leader,
<i>Il Duce</i>, Benito Mussolini!

He heard of our act
and is coming to see us! Oh!

[chuckles]
[yawns]

He and I are very close.

Here we are in Roma.

That's him, back there.

You will make me and your papa so proud.

Proud.

[boat horn blares]


Excuse me, sir.


Can... Can you take me there?

Please?

It's just across the strait.



It's a graveyard!
[explosion]

Oh dear... Oh...

The dogfish, risen from the icy depths

to take its tribute in blood and steel.

A monster the size o' 20 ships,

full of hunger and rage.

Oh please. That's just children's stories.

Captain,

my son is on the other side of the gulf.

He is performing tomorrow.

This is all I have in the world.

Take it. It's yours.

I just want to see him again.


[captain groans]

Step and turn. And step and turn.
[upbeat carnival music playing]

And look alive and step.

Step. Step.
Can I take a moment to rest?

No. Your tempo
is getting sloppier and sloppier.

No rest whatsoever.
[groans]


Five minutes, please.


Three minutes.

[Spazzatura groans]
[Pinocchio] Ooh.



Are you feeling okay, Pinocchio?

We're concerned.

You look so tired and worn out.

You need a good long rest.

And some trousers and another ear
wouldn't hurt either if you ask me.

Why not go home
and visit your papa for a while?

This is no place for you.


I have to keep working
and working and sending money.

Yeah...

The truth is

Count Volpe is using you.

He hasn't sent a penny to your father.

What?

He keeps all the money for himself.

He doesn't care about you.

You're not his favorite.

Spazzatura is his favorite.

He's always been. He's a genius.

No! Count Volpe wouldn't lie to me.

I'm... I'm his star!

You're... You're all just jealous!


Ugh. [blows raspberry]


[boat horn toots]

You think we will find him, Sebastian?

My Pinocchio?

I do. You see...

<i>â™ª My dear father loved to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª "Hop to the top of the day"</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª "The drops are easy to swallow"</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª My dear father loved to say</i> â™ª

Arrivederci!

<i>â™ª "Mop your tears
And mend your sorrows</i> â™ª

<i>- â™ª To not drown yourself wishing..." â™ª</i>
[growls]

[roaring]
[Geppetto, Cricket scream]

[Pinocchio singing scales]

Ha ha! It's me!

Look, here he comes!
<i>- </i>It's him! It's him!

It's Pinocchio! Let me talk to him.
Thank you. Oh, you're very kind.

Not right now, I'm sorry.

[kids groan]

[Volpe] You worthless...
[Spazzatura shrieking]


Hmm?


What have you been saying to him, huh?

On the night before the big performance,
you could cost me everything!

You know who's coming? You have any idea?
[Spazzatura shrieking]

I found you
at the bottom of that cage in the rain.

You were left there to die.

Nobody wanted you, and I saved you.

Rescued you!

I should've let you die!

Hey! Stop that!

Don't hurt him anymore!

This does not concern you, Pinocchio.
You're a star. Go rehearse your steps.

I demand that you stop!

You said it! I am the star of this show,

and I won't have
my costar treated this way.

And what's this I hear about
my papa not getting any money?

I might just go home
right now and ask him.

What do you think about that?

You can perform for <i>Il Dolce</i> yourself.


I think you misunderstand
our relationship, my little fire hazard.

I am the puppeteer.

Uh!
You are the puppet.

I am the master.

You are the slave!

[gasping]
[Volpe] And you will do as I command

until your wooden body rots,

and I use you to warm my furnace!

[whimpers]
Oh.

You may have no strings,

but I control you.

You obey me.

Capisce?

Spazzatura.



[deep growl]

A son knows when his father is alive.

He will look for us, you'll see.

You have nothing to worry about.
[coughs]

Easy for you to say.


[both chuckle]

We are having dinner tonight.

[both chuckle]


[fanfare playing]

[people cheering]

[indistinct whispering]

Oh, Your Excellency!

I wrote this number just for you.

I like puppets.

Hey, Spazzatura.
Hmm?

You know, I think we ought to make
this big showstopper extra special

for the all-important <i>Dolce</i> tonight.

Huh?
I got some real good ideas.

that will definitely work.

[indistinct whispering]
[audience claps]

<i>In bocca al lupo, </i>my puppet.

Delight the <i>Duce,</i>
and I will shower you with glory.

Oh, we'll give him
a show he will never forget.


[audience cheering, applause]

[upbeat battle music plays]

<i>â™ª I fight for the land â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I fight oversea</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª For baby-poops-his-pants
Right there in front of me</i> â™ª

<i>- â™ª The poop in hand, for fatherland</i> â™ª
Poop?

Yes. Poop, Your Excellency.

<i>â™ª Il Duce, Il Duce
Go smell your farts and pray</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Eat your boogers, your slime
You can also get mine</i> â™ª

[audience chants] Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!
Ah!

<i>â™ª Like a bag of poop
Magnificent and free â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You are farting
Farting in the men's lavatory â™ª</i>

[laughs]
<i>- â™ª You're a poop!</i> â™ª

<i>- â™ª We are young! â™ª</i>
[flatulence]

<i>â™ª Eat caca, big baby
Eat caca, we are strong!</i> â™ª

[audience cheering, applause]

These puppets, I do not like.

Shoot him!

And burn it all down.

Oh, hi! It's me!

Ugh, it's him again.

I cannot die!

We know.

I can't die.
[groans]

I can't die!

[all rabbits] Through the door.


I've escaped war, bullets, fire...

I was run over!

I could get killed a lot!

I'm the luckiest boy in the world.

you were charged with a terrible burden.

Huh? A burden?

No, I'm not.

That's a horrible thing to say to a boy.


And eternal life
can bring eternal suffering.


Aw, it's not so bad as all that.

Yeah, I get a little beat up every time,

but as soon as I get back,
I'm going home to my papa.

what if you don't see your father again?

Of course I will.

Why wouldn't I?


your friends,
your loved ones, they do not.

Every moment shared with them
may be the very last.

You never know how long
you have with someone until they're gone.

Huh? I... I don't understand.

Can... Can you tell me more?

Please? No! No! No!



I knew it! You came back to life.

Hi, Candlewick.

Most of us, we have but one life
to give for our fatherland, but you...

you have no limit!

Me?
[Podesta] Yes!

You!

Follow my orders, learn to obey,
and you will be the perfect soldier.

But, my papa...

You'll return home a hero.

Any father would be proud of such a son.

[knock at window]
[soldier] We're here.

[curious, dramatic music playing]

["Rataplan delleÂ Camicie Nere" playing]

[lyrics in Italian]

[kids shouting]

[whistle blows]


What's all this?

The Elite Military Project
for Special Patriotic Youth.

What's an elite?
We are.

We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers!

Learn? Like school?

To... To read and write
and do the <i>mulplitication</i> thingies?


You're funny. [laughs]

[song ends]


They're reporting
hostile planes in the area.

But <i>we</i> will carry on
with the exercises tomorrow.

Anyone here afraid of the enemy?

Uh-huh!
[boys] No, sir!

Mm-mm.

Good.

You may be boys,
but you have the hearts of men.

Tomorrow, you train
for the glory of Italy!

Tomorrow, you will
make your fatherland proud.




What do you think
my father meant about those planes?

I don't know.

I still don't really understand
what we're even doing here.

We're preparing to be soldiers. For war.

But my papa said war is bad.

That's 'cause he's a coward.

A coward? My papa?

Well, he's afraid of war, isn't he?

My father says if you're afraid to die
for yourÂ country, you're weak.

You're a coward.

Are you afraid?

I'm not afraid at all.

Well, neither am I. Or my papa.

I love war.
I love it more!

I love it twenty-four seven,
every day and anytime!

So do I!
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

I'll show him I'm no coward.

I'll make him like me.

You know,
all fathers love their sons, but...

sometimes fathers feel despair,
like everyone else.

And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

But with time, they learn
they never really meant it at all.

And they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward,

but inside...

they love you.

Are you scared?

Of dying?

Me? Nah.

I died a couple times.

It was all right.

There's rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand.

Blue sand.


You're so weird.

No weirder than you, pal!

[both laugh]

I'm... I'm glad you're here.


Me too.


the destiny of Italy will be forged

in the strength of its youth.

Today, you'll get your first taste of war.

You'll form two teams.

In the center of the battlefield
is a tower.

The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins.

And remember,

no matter who is on the other team,

they are your enemy.

May the best man win

and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all.

[adventurous music playing]

Rifles are loaded with paint.

And the grenades, confetti.

Mark your kill, boys.
[boys clamoring]

[man] For Italia!
[gasps]

[whistle blows]
[grunts] Hey!

[grunts] Watch it!
[boys yelling]


W... Wait!

[boys yelling]





[boys laughing]


Come on, boys! Let's go!

[boys shouting]


Go! Go!
[boy] Charge!



[boy 2] Watch out!
Oh!


Faster! Follow me!

[indistinct shouting]
[explosion]



Take this. [grunts]

[boys cheering]

[Candlewick grunting]



[both grunting]




[Candlewick laughs]



[cheering, applause]

You're both here. Why?


Oh. Is that so?

And how did you come
to that conclusion, may I ask?

It was a tie.

We both climbed up fast.

Very good, then.

Candlewick...

[gun cocks]

...shoot the puppet.

[boys gasp]


this is a real gun.

[boys gasp]

Take your glory, son!

Shoot the puppet!

[siren blaring]

<i>Take your positions on the parapets.</i>


<i>Defend the center.</i>

<i>For Italy!</i>

[soldier 2] We are under attack!

I told you to shoot the puppet!

No! I will not let you do this!



All my life, Father,
just trying to please you.

But I never will!

You were right.

I'm thin and weak and flimsy,
just like the wick of a candle.

Always afraid.

But even then, withÂ all the fear I feel,
I can say no to you.

[gun rattles]
I can do that.

I'm not afraid to say no. Are you?

You filthy coward!

[grunts]
[Candlewick pants]

Yes, you are weak!

You are no son of mine! [grunts]

[Candlewick screams]

Candlewick!

Puppet!

On your feet.

[Candlewick groans]

Time for the final lesson.

[tense music playing]

Now,

you will know what it is
to truly serve the fatherland!

Ah!


[bomb whistling]


[airplane engine whirs]

[explosion]
[boys clamoring]

Ah! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!




Hello, my little rebel.

I've found you at last.

I lost everything.

And now you will too.


[airplanes whirring]
Huh?

Candlewick!

<i>Bonjour, mon Ã©toile.</i>

No! Where's Candlewick?

Spazzatura! Please! Help me!


I'm all he has in this world,
the poor thing.

I have forgiven him.

But you! You squandered everything!
[pants]

Give me that torch, Spazzatura!


Spazzatura!

Ah! Give me that, you mangy ape!
[yelps]

Let me go!

Is our contract worth nothing?

I'll do my part,

and you, you will burn.

Burn bright!

Like a star!

Hey, that's hot!

Worse than chocolate!

Ow! Ow!
[laughs]


Please! Help!

[chattering]
[Pinocchio] Help! Ow!

Help!

[squeals]
Ah!



How could you do this to me?

And for a puppet?

You loathsome <i>lusus naturae</i>!

[suspenseful music playing]

You will betray me no more!



[Volpe grunting]

[Volpe grunting]

[Spazzatura squeals]

[both scream]

Spazzatura!




[water burbling]

[Spazzatura whimpers]

Spazzatura.

Will I ever see my papa again?

[seagull squawking]
Huh?

Huh?


[chattering]
[Pinocchio laughs]

[deep groaning]

[sinister music playing]

Swim!
[screams]

[both scream]

Whoa!

[both screaming]

[Pinocchio screams]

Huh?



Huh?

Ugh.




<i>â™ª And if you looked at me today â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My heart would heal so fast</i> â™ª

Papa? Papa!

<i>â™ª And if you held me right away</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª I'd be complete at last â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At last â™ª</i>


Papa!

You're alive!
[gasps]


Pinocchio!

Oh.

[chattering]
My Pinocchio.


Love hurts.

[violin playing]


After you're feeling better,
we'll go right home. Okay?

No, Pinocchio, no.

There's no escape from this dreaded beast.

He comes seeking the warmth of the sun
every decade or so.

It will soon sink back to the depths

of the darkest, coldest ocean
where it dwells,

and it will drag us with him.

Oh my God! This is it!

Follow me!
[Spazzatura chatters]

Follow you? Where?

Up to the lighthouse and freedom!

[adventurous music playing]

[Spazzatura chatters]

The blow holes!
We can climb out through them!

But we... we'll never reach it.
It's... It's too far!

Pinocchio can help!

Pinocchio, look.

Okay, we have to climb...

[beast groans]

What is it, Pinocchio?

Oh, Papa, I hate you!

What? Well, what do you...

And I hate you too, Spazzatura.
And you, Sebastian J. Cricket!

[Spazzatura chatters]

Yes, I see!
Just this once, lie, m'boy! [chuckling]

Yes, that's it! Lie!

My name is Panucchio!

More, Pinocchio!

I love the smell of onions!

I love... I love war!


I wanna be trapped here
forever and ever and ever!


[Spazzatura squealing]

Climb now! Everybody, climb!

Hurry! Come on!

[grunting]
[squeals]

What are you...
[shrieking]

Oh.

Oh. Now steady on... Whoa!

[grunts]
[squeals]

[beast groans]


Oh. Oh. Oh my word. Oh dear.


Whoa. Hold it. Whoa.

[suspenseful music playing]


[Spazzatura chatters]
[grunts]


That's it!

[Cricket laughs]

Don't look down, Pinocchio!

[beast growls]
[gasps]


Look at your papa!
[screams]






Ah!

No! No! Ah!



Hold on, my boy!
[chattering]

[Geppetto] Ah!
Help! Help!

[Geppetto grunts]

[all screaming]

[both screaming]

[beast grumbles]

[Pinocchio grunting]

[beast wails]

[both screaming]

[Geppetto screams]


[mysterious music playing]





[rumbling]
[gasps]


Whoa!




Oh no! Pinocchio!
[shrieks]

[suspenseful music playing]



Papa!


It's coming for us! Quick!





Come on, Spazzatura. YouÂ can do it!




Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah!



Hold on!


Ah!






[beast growls]

[Spazzatura screams]


No, not now! [panting]

[door opens]


Send me back now! Please!

I need to go back to save my papa.


All the sand must fall
before you can return.

There's no time! He's dying!


and if we break them,

there are dire consequences.

If you were to go back now, so soon,

you would become mortal.

You might save Geppetto,

but you will die, Pinocchio,

and it will be your last life.

I don't care!

Send me back!

Do it!


Break the rules. Break them.

If you're sure.

[gongs sounding]

[mystical music playing]


And make the most of it.

[whimsical music playing]


[dramatic music playing]



Ah! [grunts]


[Spazzatura panting]





I can't believe it!


[Geppetto coughing]




[sentimental music playing]

Pinocchio.


My boy. My boy.

Wake up, Pinocchio.

Like last time!

Get up!

You're fine. You... You...

[sentimental music continues]

You are here.

My dear son.

Can't you see me?

You're... You're alive.

You're so free. I...

I need you.









And you did.

You did bring me joy.

Such terrible, terrible joy.


Please, bring him back to me.

he became a real boy.

And real boys don't come back.

I know that.

I know! But...



In this world,
you get what you give, remember?

And this boy gave...

Well, he gave everything he could!


You said if I should perform my duties
and make Pinocchio a good boy,

guide him into doing what is right,
you would concede me one wish.


And did you accomplish this task?

Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great.

Maybe I messed up a little or... a lot,

but, well, I tried my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

Pinocchio taught me that.

I mean, I taught it to him,
and then he taught it straight back at me.

And you know why? Because...

Because he was good.





choose wisely.

Well, gosh darn it!

I wish him back to life!


Little wooden boy made of pine,

may you rise with the sun

and wander the earth.

Be his son.

Fill his days with light...

[mystical music playing]
[whimpers]

...so he'll never be alone.

Pinocchio.

My child.

I was trying
to make you someone you were not.

So don't be Carlo or anyone else.

Be exactly who you are.

I...

I love you

exactly as you are.



Then I will be Pinocchio.

And you will be my papa.

Will that do?

That will do.

[uplifting music playing]




Oh.

Life is such a wonderful gift.


that we lived our lives.</i>

Checkmate!
[squeals]

the wood sprite again.</i>

<i>Geppetto aged.</i>

<i>Pinocchio didn't.</i>

<i>And in time, Geppetto left.</i>

<i>One winter morning,
Pinocchio found me by the window.</i>

<i>I wasn't moving anymore.</i>

<i>So he put me in a matchbox,
and he carries me still with him.</i>

<i>Right in his heart.</i>



<i>And the world,
I believe, embraced him back.</i>

<i>I've not heard of him in quite a while.</i>

<i>Will he eventually die?</i>

<i>I think so.</i>

<i>And maybe that makes him a real boy.</i>

<i>What happens, happens.</i>

<i>And then, we are gone.</i>

[gentle music playing]

or are you gonna play?

Do you mind?

I was recounting my life!

It was a good life!

Ah, good enough.

[clears throat]

Hit it, boys!
