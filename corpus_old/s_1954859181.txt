Isn't it so cute?

Come on, it's so cute.

Take it home with you.

It's super cute, isn't it?

Put it in.

Let go of them!

No! It's not me!

Who is she?

She's my biggest hero

on this planet-

my sister, Dan!

She's like a mysterious alien.

She's the best gift
the UFO brought to the Earth.

Even there is no future for us,

I still want to be with you.

This is our fate.

I don't love you anymore.

Please leave.

No!

Why can't you understand it?

There are so many things

that are beyond our control!

Ever since she was little

she's never liked any men apart from our dad.

She hates them.

But I don't know why.

Brothers! Kill them!

Kill them!

Dan has the magic power of a superwoman!

Everyone in our town knows that

Dan's energy erupts as soon as

she hears any girl calling for help.

She has a strong sense of justice.

Her superpower is invincible!

Don't bully girls.

Kick the stinky boys' asses.

Shave the bad men's armpits.

I for girls and girls for me!

Bad Girls, let's go!

Dan - a great fighter
with a strong sense of justice

Pei - knowledgeable and an expert in analysis

Mi - sweet, gentle and good at handcraft

They form the trio of "Bad Girls".

Girls united!

Fight the stinky boys!

So the responsibilities of fighting the evil

and keeping the peace in the universe

fall solely on her shoulders!

Who is she?

She is my dearest sister -

Dan!

Teachers and classmates,

here comes to the end of my speech

on "My Biggest Hero".

Thank you all.

Morning, Mom.

Morning.

Sweetie, would you like juice or milk?

I want this.

Hey, that's mine!

I won't wait for you,

if you don't hurry up.

Mom, look!

She's doing it again!

I'll going to tell Dad about it.

Sweetie, be nice to your sis, alright?

No!

Anyway Dad's working in Taipei.

He won't be back for another month.

Suit yourself.

Hurry up! Bye!

Sis, wait for me!

Hey, here are soft-boiled eggs!

Sis, are we going there today?

Of course! Come on!

It's such a lovely day!

Right,

maybe something nice will happen.

Well, I would hope so.

Get out of my way, please!

Gosh, it's such a long queue.

Come on.

Get in the queue.

Come on, off you go!

Great!

Spring onion bread fresh from the oven!

Not again!

I can't see what's good
about spring onion bread.

Well, you'll never get it.

Anyway, it's yummy!

There seems to be plenty left.

Give me my bread back!

Give it back!

Take it

Who are you?

How dare you snatch my bread!

You, crazy woman!

Give me the bread back!

%*@$#&%@?

What?

She says,

"How dare you bully a little girl? "

Mind your own business

or I'll ask my dad to beat you up.

%*@$#&%@!

Justice is on our side.

Hmph! See if you dare to do it again?

Give it to me.

Come! Here you are.

Good girl.

Thank you.

And mine?

Wow, spring onion bread!

Sis, we'll be late for school.

Hurry UP!

Look!

Shut up!

Can't you just let me enjoy the bread?

You really love to be on time, don't you?

Go!

Yeah, Justin went to practice in the bakery

early in the morning.

Yes,

we just left.

We're on the way.

Well, you look great on the cover.

Jusfin,

you've learned everything about the shooting?

Yes, I have.

Well...

I really can't understand

why you love this script so much.

There are so many layers in this story.

If I want to become a real actor,

I need to try different roles.

I don't want to be just a pop idol.

You'll bump into a wall if you keep reading!

What are you doing?

Give it back to me!

Jump higher!

Huang Dan-Chi! -Higher!

Okay, here you are.

You can't understand a word in it.

Hey!

I nearly fell over.

Hey, I'm sorry.

Dan!

What's it?

Ah,

this is the so-called "confession".

Confession?

Really? You're so lucky!

Dan, someone has fallen for you.

Idiot! Is he looking for trouble?

Headmaster.

This is a very nice school.

It feels spacious...

bright...

...and comfortable.

But...

It lacks...

the soul.

What? The soul?

Well, Headmaster...

Isn't it better not to have a soul?

What the director means is

your school has a unique style of its own

and it'll serve as the inspiration
for his work.

Oh, inspiration!

Director, you're right.

It's such a beautiful place.

It's as pretty as a postcard.

Besides, people are very friendly here.

If the film could boost tourism

in a rural town

like ours,

I'll be so grateful to you.

I'll give you the thumbs up.

You're more than welcome.

I wonder who the lead actor is

in this film.

He's the hottest pop idol - Justin!

Jusfin,

walk slowly.

Walk in slow motion.

Kill them with your eyes!

Wow, what's going on here?

Is it a goddess procession?

Pei, who is that guy?

Don't you know him?

He's the No.1 pop idol in Asia.

The best lead actor in romantic movies.

He is Justin!

Oh, the one who sings "Baby, baby"?

Not that one! Dan!

He's the one we all fancy!

You know what?

I've got his photo album, posters...

And...

the lip balm he advertises!

I even joined his fan club.

Let me see.

Wow, I can't believe it!

Isn't it bit too much?

Why am I the only one who doesn't know him?

Hey, Dan, you can't use it!

You'll ruin it!

Give it back to me!

Huang Dan-Chi!

Wow, he's really a superstar!

Yeah, super popular!

Even there weren't so many people

at my political rally!

This is just the beginning.

When the film is released,

it'll cause even more sensation here.

Excuse me.

Can you tell me

what the film is about?

It's based on a true love story

which happened in the 1980s.

A boy and a girl who trained as athletes.

As they trained together,

they gradually fell in love with each other.

I feel so tired

as we have to practice every day.

I train with you every day.

We run on the same track.

We breathe the same air.

But I have to keep reading your mind.

I feel so tired...

so tired...

So so tired.

Don't worry.

You won't feel tired if you enjoy it.

Cut!

Good!

Very good!

Jessica,

you successfully portray

the shyness and the longing of the girl.

Okay.

Let's move on to the "vaulting box" scene!

Good. Let's go.

Action!

Cut.

Cut.

Cut.

Cut.

Where has your agility gone?

Where has the beautiful curve gone?

You totally wasted your training in gymnastics!

After all, can you do it?

Okay, all actors, take a break.

We'll resume shooting later.

Hey,

would you like to come to mine for dinner?

I can't. I need to write an essay.

It's summer vacation!

What essay do you need to write?

Princeton Science asked me to do it.

Ask Mi instead.

But I need to get some yarns.

I would be a little bit late...

Hey,

what's wrong with you guys?

It's summer vacation.

How can you be so busy?

Anyway)'

we all live in the same street.

You must show up tonight.

Did you get it?

Hey, who is this kid?

Hey, you're so slow!

Huang Dan-Chi.

I...

I need to talk to you.

Get out of my way!

I know... it's rather sudden,

but I really like...

Are you looking for trouble?

How dare you touch me!

Wow!

What?

What are you laughing at?

You're in love?

I'm going to tell Mom.

You!

You'll be dead meat if you dare to tell her.

No, I won't.

I'm not afraid of you!

You!

You can't catch me!

Stop running!

Come back!

Hang in there.

Let's consider it again.

We don't have to do vaulting box.

How about hopscotch? Will it do?

No, it has to be vaulting box.

But we're stuck here.

If we really can't do vaulting box...

We can't go on like this.

Shall we skip it and move on to the next scene?

What do you think?

No, not the next scene.

This scene comes first. We'll try again.

Come back!

You cheeky monkey!

Get out of my way.

Stop running.

You cheeky monkey!

You're so naughty.

Get out of my way.

Come get me!

You...

You're so naughty.

You can't get me!

Slop!

Stop running.

Come get me!

What is my Justin doing here?!

You again!

Huang Dan-Chi!

You're such a trouble-maker!

I didn't mean it!

She was lying on the floor.

Who would see her?

He)', young girl.

You've got such an attitude, yeah?

It's all your fault that the accident happened.

You hurt our Jessica.

How are you going to compensate us?

Compensate?

Why should I compensate?

Justin turned down all other films

just for this one.

He even put in his own money.

Now the lead actress is seriously injured.

How are we going to carry on shooting?

Hey, what's the big deal? It's just a movie!

Besides,

she is just a decorative vase.

A vase?

You have to mend the vase since you broke it!

Fine, bring it to me!

You're being so unreasonable!

So what?

How about you?

What?

Me?

You stand in, as compensation.

What?

I...

Are you scared?

Justin, you know what you're talking about?

You got to be kidding me!

No problem. I trust my judgment.

Besides, my contract allows me

to choose the lead actress, right?

Director,

I can do with her!

I...

I can do with her too.

She can do it.

Yes, she can! -No...

Are you serious?

Huang Dan-Chi,

since the summer vacation begins tomorrow

do your best.

If you mess it up...

I'll ask your mother to come to school.

Okay, everything settled.

Let's have tea next door.

Let's go.

Sir...

That's it.

Dan, what are you going to do?

You'll be in a film!

The film tells a story of a boy and a girl

who train as athletes.

They train happily together.

One day the boy gets injured
and feels depressed.

But with your encouragement,

he later becomes a great baker.

But Dan,

it's a romantic film.

Can you really act?

It's all your fault!

Hey,

she gets to play with my Justin!

If she's afraid, I can do it for her.

I'm not afraid!

A romantic film?

Isn't it all about falling in love?

Why should I be afraid of it?

But sis,

have you ever fallen in love?

Oh!

This thing makes my scalp so itchy.

What are you trying to do?

Hey,

do you know you're a girl?

Of course! I know I'm a girl.

And my name is Dan,

not "hey".

Okay)'

Dan.

May I ask you a question?

Why did you get yourself into such a state?

Your hair is as dry as a kitchen sponge.

Your eyebrows...

...look like caterpillars.

And your muscles...

...look like a bodybuilder's!

Call yourself the leading lady?!

Spare me the torture, please!

Hey, why are you so mean to me?

At least I'm really healthy.

And...

I'm not ugly.

Well,

Forget about it.

What?

You! Pervert!

Looking for trouble?

You hit my face!

Stop running!

Come back!

Stay away from me!

Get her!

Stay away from me!

Don't hit me.

I'm going to kill you all!

Assistant director,

I've done my best.

Where is my sis?

Hmm... it's alright.

Alright? What do you mean?

For Christ's sake,

I always know I'm beautiful.

Beautiful?

If you become famous,

I'll be your servant!

You never get it.

You won't make it...

In this scene,

you gradually fall in love with each other

as you spend so much time together.

Dan,

give me a cute subtle smile.

Be subtle.

Don't too much, okay?

Oh...

Okay.

Get ready.

Okay, everyone ready?

Action!

Cut.

Dan,

What's wrong with your face?

I'm trying to look cute.

What's wrong?

Didn't I ask you to put on a cute subtle smile

when you steal a glance of Justin?

Yes, subtle...

Look,

I steal the glance...

Subtle...

Don't I look cute?

You call it cute?

You thought it was easy to be an actress?

None of your business!

I'm playing a young athlete.

They should compete on the tracks.

Whoever wins falls for the other.

Stop pretending to be cute.

Stealing a glance?

I'm not a pervert!

Director,

so I've told you!

You should find some new actress.

She does nothing but delays the progress.

Then I'll just take Justin away from the mess.

Okay.

Let's have a race.

Ah?

See?

Justin, why are you speaking up for her?

Since the girl is a young athlete,

it makes sense...

if she leaves their fate

to running.

Director,

what do you think?

Okay.

Let's change it to "running for love".

Yes!

Let's go.

I didn't know you need
so many people in the crew.

Yeah, I guess

there are at least one hundred people here.

They never finish their lunch boxes.

But I never leave anything in mine.

After all, I'm still growing.

Look how busy they are!

I wonder what they're busy with.

They're busy with nothing!

Damn!

What the hell are you doing?

Don't you know you can't walk on that?

But this is really heavy.

Give it to me.

See? Go get some training!

Put it down!

Sit down.

What are you doing?

Why did you help them move the equipment?

That's their job.

You're the leading lady.

What if you get injured?

How can I possibly get injured?

Besides, how can I ignore them

when them need help?

You were intervening!

Film-making is all about collaboration.

Everyone has his job in the crew.

You're the leading lady.

You should memorize all the lines.

Focus on acting.

If you help them move the equipment,

you'll get sweaty, right?

Then I have to do your make-up again, right?

Isn't it a waste of time for everyone?

So from now on,

come back as soon as you finish shooting.

And go shooting from here.

Don't go anywhere else.

DO you get it?

Change the clothes!

Yes, here we are!

No! It's me!

Not her!

Don't touch!

Cut!

Another take.

Cut!

Another take.

Cut!

What's wrong with you?

How many times have I told you?

The most important thing in this scene

is when you are training

the boy's encouragement makes you

fall in love with running.

I want to see passion in your eyes.

Passion!

Do you understand?

Alright...

Hey, Dumb!

I'm Dan!

How many times do I have to say?

Whatever.

Dumb,

if you keep running like this,

we'll never finish the scene.

Do you understand what passion means?

Sir, I'm running out of energy.

How am I going to find passion?

Making films is so boring...

I'm starving...

How many times do I have to run?

When are we going to have lunch?

I'm starving.

Okay. Come on, get ready.

Not again.

Camera.

Action.

Cut!

Okay!

Dan!

Where are you going?

Hey, you!

Get her back!

Yes!

Dan, here is your lunch box.

Thank you.

Mr. Justin, here is yours.

What's wrong?

I've no appetite.

Well, I've got a great appetite!

So according to my analysis,

he's absolutely a weirdo.

Exactly!

He's really a weirdo.

Once what's-his-name brought him a lunch box.

He didn't even touch it.

Really?

They said the stars are temperamental.

That's right. He was being temperamental.

Every time

when the director thinks it's okay

he always insists on having another take.

Cut!

Okay.

Director,

One more take.

So he must be really annoying.

Oh, there is someone even more annoying.

Cut!

Hey, do you know how to act?

Please don't block Justin from the view.

Please!

Hey, catch it.

Good!

What is it?

Breakfast! I'm being really nice to you, right?

I can see that.

I mean why you brought me breakfast.

Thank you for the yummy bread

the other day.

You know that, right?

I'm still growing. I feel hungry all the time.

This is to say thank you,

so take it.

Wow!

Wow!

This is what you call "food".

Wow, it's so good!

It's not fair!

Why do you have a trailer full of food?

I want the food, too!

I did a lot of research on bread for this film.

I think these are alright.

If you like them, take them all.

Really?

Can I really have them?

Can I have all of them?

You're already eating.

Well, yeah.

Thank you.

Hey,

I think you make them for your own sake.

Alright, whatever you say.

Hey,

why don't you want people to know about it?

You're being temperamental!

Me?

Being temperamental?

Yeah, my friends say that

stars love being temperamental

and mysterious.

You're all so weird.

Last time what's-his-name brought you lunch.

But you didn't even touch it.

I saw it!

When everything mixes together,

it loses its taste.

That shows you don't respect food.

But you mix everything in your tummy anyway.

Attention, please.

On the last day of the summer camp,

we're going to have a potluck.

Please bring a dessert you make

with your family

and we'll see whose is the best.

Yes.

Hsi, as for the potluck...

what are you going to make with your family?

I...

I'm not sure yet.

My mom's cheese cake is the best.

She says it's made of the cheese from the Alps!

It smells so nice.

That's nothing!

My sis makes green tea and red bean cake.

You'll never forget

how smooth it feels

in your mouth.

Hmph! Nothing beats my mom's

taro and honey macaroons.

Take a bite and

the tastes of taro and honey

mix in your month.

The sweetness never goes away!

Hsi, how about you?

Okay.

Breathe out.

Do you feel better now?

Baby, what's wrong?

Mom... can you make cake?

You want some cake?

Well... the teacher at the summer camp asks us

to bring a dessert we make with our family.

Okay)'

Mom will make it for you tomorrow.

Great.

But, can you really make it?

Don't worry. I can make anything.

Flour.

Okay, baby. Water.

Pass the water to me.

Keep beating it until it gets really smooth.

The last one.

Here we are!

It's done.

Mom...

Isn't it Chinese pastry?

It's cake as long as it has egg in it, right?

How can you call it cake?

Do you want to become a baker?

Yes.

You do?

Do you know why we have
to roll the dough like this?

No, I don't.

No?

Because

it'll make the bread taste smoother.

It'll make it more delicious.

Be delicious.

Dad, what are you doing?

I'm talking to the dough.

Why are you talking to it?

The dough is a living thing.

If we want people who eat the bread

to feel our good will,

we can tell the dough about it.

Really?

You can give it a try.

Be delicious!

Is it good?

Yes, it's so good.

Director,

I really can't burst into tears.

Why should I cry while nothing happens to me?

What's-his-name!

Try to make her cry!

Director, it's done.

Keep rolling.

Action.

Director,

it's dried up!

Cut!

It's not working.

Cut!

Very good!

Okay. N ext.

I didn't expect

Justin to be so smart.

He even discovered that

food is Dan's biggest weakness.

Really?

I think...

Dan's just after the food.

I don't think she's in love.

In love?

Huang Dan-Chi,

who are you in love with?

How about me?

Huang Dan-Chi!

Here I come!

You again?

No.

Dan can't be in love with my Justin.

We have find out more about it.

Kick the stinky boys' asses.

Shave the bad men's armpits.

I for girls and girls for me!

Bad Girls, let's go!

Wow! What is it?

It's my first time to see
a trailer full of desserts.

Be serious, you guys!

This trailer full of food

definitely holds the key to

Justin's control over Dan.

Let's destroy it!

Ready?

Yes, Captain!

It's so yummy!

Work harder!

In this scene,

Justin would confess his love for you.

Then he'll hold you.

You should look a little shocked

and a little shy.

Just a little.

Don't too much, okay?

Okay.

Come on.

Shy?

Ready!

What are you laughing at?

You're scared, right?

Do your best, okay?

Ready, steady, 90!

62A-6 take01.

Action!

Mu-Yun, it's such a lovely day.

Thank you for inviting me out.

Yeah.

The beautiful weather reminds me of you.

Look! Seagulls!

Yes, seagulls!

Wow!

They look as happy as we are.

You know what?

In the past three years,

I felt there was a knot in my heart
that I could never untie it...

What knot?

It's a very complicated feeling.

A feeling...

...that I can't explain.

But it just happened.

It made my heart race all the time.

But I couldn't control it.

I felt so painful

until I saw your smile.

Then I realized that

it's all because of you.

Because of me?

Because...

I like you.

Cut.

You must be hungry.

Mom.

Mom.

What?

Can I ask you a question?

What does it mean

when a boy...

...kisses a girl?

That means the boy likes the girl.

But...

...the boy usually pays no attention

to the girl.

Besides,

you can't tell the boy likes the girl at all.

Well,

maybe as they spend a lot of time together

the boy gradually becomes
attracted to the girl.

Then they fall in love with each other.

Really?

FaHin love?

Mom.

What does it mean, fall in love?

I don't know what it means either.

I just know

I feel so happy every time...

when I see your dad finish the food I cook

and smile with satisfaction.

So...

that's what falling in love means.

What is love like?

Love is like Sunday morning.

What is love like?

Love is like embracing the wind.

What is love like?

Love is like a dream in purple.

What is love like?

Love is like an eye that talks.

What is love like?

Love is like Sunday morning.

What is love like?

Love is like embracing the wind.

What is love like?

Love is like a dream in purple.

What is love like?

Love is like an eye that talks.

Let waves shake the sadness in my heart.

Let them wash my sadness away.

No longer worries.

Let the boat drift away

from the memories of the past.

The boat is loaded with love

and sails towards the sea.

What is love like?

Thank you all!

Come on! Come on!

Why is Dan cooking?

She says she's cooking for Justin.

Jusfin?

Why?

It doesn't make any sense at all.

Mom,

shall we help her?

I don't dare.

Mom!

I'm great, right?

You again?

Aren't you tired?

I can't let you pass.

You'll be cheated by that man.

What has it got to do with you?

I'm the only one who truly loves you...

Hello!

What are you doing here?

I'm taking you to lunch.

Come on, let's go.

I'm sure you didn't make it.

How did you know?

Look at the food.

A flower made of carrot?

You're so rough.

How could you possibly make it?

Hey,

don't be so mean.

You're a good actor

because you've been acting
since you were young.

Unlike me,

I've cooked only a few times.

Don't mention it.

They aren't happy memories.

Cut.

Cut!

Can we do it again?

I envy you

because you had a happy childhood.

Weren't you happy when you were a child?

My mom died when I was very young.

My dad gave up a well-paid job

for his dream.

He opened a bakery.

But later

he worked himself to death.

My uncle, Matthew, is the only family I have.

He's been looking after me since then.

I'll never forget my dad's expressions

when he was making bread.

He must have been really happy.

In fact, if you want,

you could do things you like.

I can't.

Like now I have to go to the shooting.

Who says so?

Come with me!

Come on!

Let's go!

What are you doing?

Hurry UP!

Hey,

where are we going?

Quiet!

Hey...

Stop asking questions!

Hey,

where on earth are we going?

Come on!

Here we are!

What do you think?

It's great, isn't it?

I want to eat as much as I can!

Hey, why did you do that?

Well, isn't it what people do in the movies?

You shout your wish out loud!

Does it work?

Of course it does!

Every time when I shout it out loud

my parents over there will hear it

and grant my wish!

For Christ's sake,

it sounds so silly.

Not at all.

My dad often says

you have to shout your mind out loud.

He tells us that

it doesn't matter

even if no one believes in you.

As long as you believe in yourself,
that's enough.

He also says

only when you're

being yourself

can you be happy-

This must be quite difficult.

Not at all.

How would you know if you've never tried?

Are you always so carefree?

Of course not!

I've got so much to worry about.

In fact...

...I'm adopted.

My dad was worried that I'd be bullied

so he teaches me Kungfu.

He hopes I'll be stronger

so I can protect myself.

I want to be stronger!

I want to be myself!

I want to be happier!

I want to eat a lot of spring onion bread!

I want cake not Chinese pastry!

I want to break 700 million at the box office.

Sis,

what were you doing with my Justin
on the bridge?

Nothing...

We were just rehearsing.

Ouch!

What are you doing? It really hurts!

If you don't tell the truth,
I'll tell Mom about it.

Hey,

pinch me again and I won't make cake for you.

You'll get in trouble at school.

Please, sis!

Please help me!

Okay.

But can you really make it?

Don't worry.

I can make anything!

Uncle, this is for you.

I made it myself...

Sit down, Justin.

What's going on

between you and the girl?

Nothing.

We're just friends.

Fï¬‚ends?

Then you must be

such good friends

that you kissed her and went on a date.

I won't stop you seeing girls.

But have you ever thought

why that bumpkin wants to get close to you?

It's for your own good!

Uncle,

don't assume everyone

who wants to be friends with me is bad.

I've the rights to choose my friends

and things I want to do, right?

I really can't understand you.

I just want to be myself.

If you're not yourself,

then what are you?

This is not the real me!

I want to make bread.

I want to be myself.

This is so disgusting!

This is the most disgusting thing

I've ever had in my life.

My Justin?

What are you doing here?

You've been stalking me!

What's the smell?

I don't know either...

You're really dumb, aren't you?

You even burned it?

Besides,

this is Chinese pastry, right?

Well, how would I know?

Are you making it for us?

Sure,

I can't do cake

but I can make very good bread.

But can you really make it?

Don't worry.

I can make anything.

First you put the flour in

and add some yeast.

Then pour some water in.

You make the dough

and wait until it's risen.

Look!

It has risen.

I also put dried longan in it.

Wow!

Remember to squeeze the air out from the dough.

So the bread will look prettier.

Yeast and lactic acid bacteria

play an important role in bread making.

They're just like lovers.

They fall in love

only at a certain temperature.

Be delicious!

Try it.

Wow,

they look so pretty.

Wow, they smell so nice.

I didn't expect you could make such good bread.

I noticed that you looked so happy

when you were making bread.

I've never seen you so happy.

Really?

Yeah.

And you talked to the dough, right?

Yes.

My dad said

the dough was a living thing.

If we want people who eat the bread

feel our good will,

we need to take care of the dough

and talk to it.

Wow, it's magic!

Then...

what did you say to the dough?

I said,

"Be delicious!"

Wow,

it seems to have worked!

Hey,

thank you.

What for?

If you really want to thank me,

make bread for me every day.

Sure,

no problem!

Prospectus (French bakery school)

Okay, everyone.

Show us the dessert

you made with your family.

Please introduce it to everyone.

Yes.

This is the Chinese taro pastry my mom made.

What? Not macaroon?

This is the Chinese red bean pastry
my sister made.

What?

Where is the green tea and red bean cake?

This is the Chinese rice cake my mom made.

What? Chinese rice cake?

This is the wine and dried longan bread
I brought.

Wow, it's so delicious!

Did you see the papers

I put on your table yesterday?

Yes.

Since you love baking so much,

go learn it properly.

I'll make all the arrangements.

Stop seeing the girl.

I'm leaving.

I'm going to learn baking...

...because I want to see your smile again,

the very happy smile.

The smile on your face

when you ate the bread I made for you.

Thank you

for encouraging me to pursue my dream.

Please have some belief in me.

Please give me some more time.

I'll try to be a better person

just for you.

It doesn't matter

even if no one believes in you.

It's enough as long as you believe in yourself.

Matthew is so nasty!

He took the crew back to Taipei

just to stop Justin seeing Dan!

He's so nasty!

But Justin is even nastier!

He left without saying goodbye.

He just sent a text saying
he's leaving for France.

After all, what is Dan to him?

Mom,

what should we do?

Sis isn't being herself, right?

I've never seen her like this.

It's so worrying.

Come,

have it before it gets cold.

There is soup too.

Is it edible?

Eh? What's the smell?

Dad!

It's so nice to have you home!

Sis is acting really weird.

Only you can help her.

Do something, quick!

What's wrong with you?

What?

You're serious?

Of course!

Mom! -Darling!

Does it hurt?

No.

And you?

No, no.

It's killing me!

Why did you hit so hard?

You did the same, didn't you?

I heard from your mom that

you're in love with a big star?

Nonsense.

Don't listen to her.

He's just a friend.

Okay, okay,

if you say so.

But if he's just a friend,

how could he upset you so much?

I gave you an opening,

but you missed the chance to attack.

I just hate them leaving like that.

Without even saying goodbye.

I know nothing apart from martial arts.

I understand it's painful,

but we, martial arts fighters,
must face the pain.

We have to take up the challenge bravely.

So we won't let ourselves down and have regret.

Dan,

people come in and out of our lives.

Just let it be.

He'll come back

if he's meant to do so.

No matter what happens,

your family will always be with you.

Come on, you'll be fine.

Why are you crying?

Mom.

MY good girl.

What happened?

You're the bravest girl.

You'll make Mommy sad too...

Hey,

I finally finished the essay.

They say it'll be published in the next issue.

Yeah?

I really look forward to it.

You must show it to me.

Of course.

Dan.

What is it?

What the crap is it?

It's so disgusting!

Can you eat it?

Damn!

Bad Girls, let's go!

Hey, what are you doing?

What?

What on earth are you doing?

You bully an old lady in the broad daylight?

Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

Are you looking for trouble?

Shame on you!

Bored with life?

What are you doing?

Say "Sorry"-

I'm sorry.

Again!

Sorry, it's my fault.

Get off!

Sorry.

How dare you bully an old lady?

It serves you right, you bad guy!

The summer has gone just like that.

Dan seems to be herself again

and becomes even stronger.

I hope one day I'll become someone like her

I'll teach bad guys a lesson
and protect the whole world.

Instead of yeast,

we use two other ingredients in the baking.

Water and flour.

Mix them and turn them into dough.

Cover the dough with cloth

and leave it in 20 degree for 2 or 3 days.

Some liquid will come out of it.

It smells little bit like vinegar.

But it's milder than vinegar.

Do you understand?

Yes.

He says he's gone to learn baking in France?

I bet he's more likely to go after the girls.

According to my essay,

love...

...is like "the cocktail in our brain".

It's made of dopamine,

phenethylamine and oxytocin.

After a while

people will become resistant
to these substances

SO...

...the feelings of love disappear.

Therefore...

true love...

...never exists!

Well,

men are never faithful,

are they?

Huang Dan-Chi,

no matter how you stop me,

I still want to tell you

that I like...

Huang Dan-Chi!

I like you!

Dumb,

It's been a while.

How are you doing?

You come and go as you please.

Who do you think you are?

Tell you what?

No matter how much I love bread,

I'll never eat the bread you make.

In order to realize my dream,

I spent many months learning baking in France.

Just because I want to make bread for you.

Just because...

...I want to see your happy smile.

These are for you.

Why did you give me flowers?

They're not edible!

You're such a hypocrite.

You thought the roses

would do the trick?

Dan, come have tea.

Okay.

Dan, I really like you.

I'm serious.

Hey, why has Mi been knitting the scarf?

Well, you don't understand it.

She's been knitting the scarf
for more than ten years.

She's Waiting for the man

who truly appreciates her.

Oh, I see...

Where is Dan?

Dan?

It's the special screening today.

She didn't go to see Justin at the backstage,

did she?

Jusfin?

Don't let me see him.

Or I'll beat him up, even he's a star.

Hey,

don't behave like him.

Of course I won't!

Ladies and gentlemen,

thank you for waiting.

Thank you so much

for coming to the special screening.

Before the film starts,

let's welcome our young and ambitious

township supervisor,

Mr. Hsieh

to say a few words.

Please welcome Mr. Hsieh.

Ladies and gentlemen,

thank you so much for coming to see the film,

Good Day, My love,

sponsored by "18 Copper Men".

We feel honored

that the film was shot in our town.

My son, "Douzai",

has a cameo role in this film.

Come on, Douzai,

introduce the background

and the character you played to the audience

Daddy,

I'm the background!

Ah, it's alright.

It is our honor that we've made

our contribution

to the Taiwanese cinema

and show people the beauty of our hometown.

Do you all agree?

Yes, I do!

Oh, I got it. Got it.

Let's just watch the film.

Before that

my son and I would like to sing

a popular Taiwanese song called

"Keep Turning! Colorful Neon Lights!"

Come on, keyboard player, music on!

Keep turning! Colorful neon lights!

You make me understand life!

Sis, what are you doing?

Nothing.

Leave me alone!

You're not going to see your movie?

No, I'm not.

I don't want to see it!

Get out.

Get out!

Fancy a bite?

It's really good.

Where did you get the bread from?

From the new bakery.

Hello, Dumb!

Who is Dumb?

What are you doing here?

This...

How is it?

Is it good?

I made it for you.

It took me ages

to find edible roses.

Then I put them in this "Lovers' Rose Bread".

I work so hard just to

express my feelings for you

through bread.

You gave me the courage to

do things I enjoy.

To find my true self.

I want to make you happy and

this becomes the goal in my life.

Thank you.

Then... do you like me?

Yes, very much!

I forgot who said it.

"Life is like bread."

"Only when you eat it
will you know if it's good."

Wow, this girl is so agile!

Good! This girl will definitely be a star!

Bravo!

Just kiss her!

So...

this is how my first love affair ended.

But Dan's first love affair
is just about to begin.

Don't be fooled. The story hasn't ended yet...

Freeze!

Stop running!

Freeze!

Cut!

Okay!

Thank you!

Hey, you, where did you come from?

You can't fight properly.

You can't afford the compensation

if you hurt Dan.

I'm professional!

I feel it was okay.

Do you have any problem?

You've got such an attitude, eh?

You wouldn't apologize, would you?

Do some homework, okay?

Take him away.

I haven't finished yet.

Mi, thank you.

Well done.

What do you think? Was I good?

Very good.

Better than Lara Croft!

Hey, don't you feel too hot?

This is love.

Ah?

Wow!

I'm so hungry!

Hungry?

Stop eating.

You're getting fat!

No way!

Hey, Dumb!

It's Dan!

Wow, bread!

Thank you.

Come on, actors, get ready.

I'll keep it for you.

Thank you.

Hey, Dan.

Be careful.

Good luck!
