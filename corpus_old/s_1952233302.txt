<i>(male narrator)
Tonight on seaQuest.</i>

<i>Lucas. 
Dad.</i>

<i>I love you. </i>

<i>(Wolenczak)
Shut it down.
I can't.</i>

<i>We're gonna die.</i>

<i>And if you're gonna whine,
why don't you just stand
over there in the corner.</i>


The last I heard
was that Wolenczak is dead.

<i>(O'Neill)
Mayday, mayday,
this is the seaQuest. </i>

Going to emergency power.

<i>[alarm blaring]
We are abandoning seaQuest. </i>

[people chattering]

Most breakthroughs...

events history books
define as progress...

<i>don't arrive with the
crashing sounds of brass horns
and drum rolls.</i>

Real breakthroughs,
ones that last...

like fiber optics
and the paper clip...

sneak up on the page
from the back of the book.

<i>Let's remember
that it took mankind
100,000 years...</i>

to make a simple drinking cup.

A hundred millennia
just to drink out of a cup
instead of clasped hands.

So you see,
goodness takes time...

and sacrifice.

I mean,
the World Power Project
has taken 15 years...

<i>and it's cost me my marriage.</i>

<i>Well, I don't know my son
as well as I should.</i>

<i>But I have to believe
that it's all been
for a higher good.</i>

I mean, think of it.

<i>We're going to
turn on the lights
of the world forever.</i>

And for everyone.
And for free.

The first world
and the third world...

coming together to share
the benefits of this...

this technology.

[people chattering]

[seagulls cawing]

When was the last time
you had a day off?

<i>I don't know. Today?
I'm serious.</i>

So am I.

I take a day off
at the end of every sea tour
whether I need it or not.

<i>You're seven for twelve.
I'm nine for eleven.</i>

If I make this one stand up,
you owe me another $300.

Double or nothing!

<i>Oh, I can't do that, Shelley.
I'd be worried
about your retirement.</i>

You, want to recommend
any of them?

Recommend who?
Your crew. Some of them
are leaving, right?

<i>You can't have my crew.
Why not?</i>

<i>Because they're the best
and you've got
nothing to offer them.</i>

[seagulls cawing]

What about sunshine?

Thirteen months in a sub
would make anyone put in
for duty on a carrier.

<i>I'm not going to
argue with you,
it's our day off.</i>

<i>When the whole world
has a day off,
it doesn't feel like one.</i>

<i>Come on, it's monumental,
it's a worldwide effort.</i>

<i>Pretend it's Armistice Day.
It's a power plant.</i>

People everywhere
are getting electricity
for free...

just another
something for nothing.

<i>You're such a romantic.</i>

What I am is out $300.
You gonna let me try
and get it back?

You want to be out $600?

<i>What I want is Cmdr. Ford.
How's about we play for him?</i>

<i>He doesn't do
aircraft carriers.</i>

<i>Well, he won't mind me
playing for the right to try
and persuade him otherwise.</i>

Playing what?

Volleyball.

[people chattering]

One hour and counting.
Engage the turbines, please.



We have a compromise
at the 600-mile relay.

<i>That's expected.</i>

Mr. Rosenthal,
would you advance
the maintenance schedule.

<i>We're showing
an increased reading on...</i>

<i>Now, that's fine. That's fine.
Just carry on.</i>


<i>(Bridger)
The 21st century. </i>

<i>Mankind has colonized
the last unexplored region
on Earth... </i>

<i>the ocean. </i>

<i>As captain of the seaQuest
and its crew, 
we are its guardians. </i>

<i>For beneath the surface
lies the future. </i>

<i>@@[music playing on stereo]</i>

Hi! You know,
I wrote that tune.

[people yelling]

<i>Guy's busier than
a one-legged man
at a butt kicking contest.</i>

<i>It's a variation
of the scatter technique.</i>

The what?
Scatter technique.

It was invented by a guy
I used to work with
back in Vancouver.

<i>You know, he'll go up to
one girl after another...</i>

sometimes a hundred a night,
and ask if they wanted
to go home with him.

Did it work?
Well, he used to get
slapped a lot.

But he used to
take them home a lot, too.
The scatter technique, huh?

<i>(Crocker)
I guess I'm gonna
have to learn that one.</i>

Come on, Crocker,
you got it made.

<i>You've finished your tour.
You got that gig
running security...</i>

at Tucker Enterprises.

You and the little lady
are gonna get that condo
in Oxnard.

Hey, Lucas, you enjoying this?
Tons.

You gotta be
pretty proud of him.
Proud of who?

<i>Your dad.
I mean, he's the reason
for the holiday.</i>

This is the biggest event
of the 21st century.


<i>If I ever see him,
I'll tell him
you're impressed.</i>

The name of the game
is volleyball, gentlemen.

How about I bet on those guys
and give you points?

How many?
Ten.

Not enough.

The object is to get the ball
over the net more times
than the other guys.

Think your people
can handle that, Bridger?

<i>Just don't spend my money yet,
Shelley.</i>


You playing?

No.
Why not?

<i>Because I'm angry.
What are you angry at?
Your old man?</i>

<i>No, I'm not angry at him.
I'd be angry at him.</i>

Give me the ball.
Captain,
what are we playing for?

Pride, Commander.
Just pride.

Okay.

<i>@@[Nobody Knows playing]</i>

[Bridger grunting]


What are you laughing at?
You. I think you look cute.

<i>I'm not cute.
I'm four points behind.
Well, don't get hurt.</i>

<i>We waited a long time
to say goodbye.
I'm still working on hello.</i>

One. Two. Three.

<i>I guess you're gonna
have to find
another commander.</i>

[computer beeping]


<i>(Jordan)
We're on-line in Moscow...</i>

[crew clapping]
Jerusalem, Athens...

Tucson, Glasgow.
Yes.

Sydney, Tokyo, Beijing.

We did it.
Nairobi, Los Angeles...

New York, Paris, Brisbane.

[people cheering]

[man whooping]

We have another compromise.
Southern quadrant.

<i>We're showing a
second degree surface failure.</i>

I think we should
shut it down.

This is a
$100 billion project,
Mr. Rosenthal.

<i>We don't shut it down,
we fix it.</i>

<i>(Bridger)
I hope all of your time
aboard seaQuest... </i>

has been productive
and insightful.

<i>Thirteen months, we've logged
over 200,000 sea miles...</i>

participated in
17 rescue operations...

completed three years
of underwater research.

Congratulations.

I just hope
your memories of this tour
are as warm as mine.

As many of you know,
this boat has been
a dream of mine.

<i>I'd like to thank all of you
for making this dream
come true.</i>

Some of us are going on
to the next tour...

and others are moving
to newer opportunities.

<i>But I'd like to wish
all of you great success.</i>

Thank you and good luck!
Ten-hut.

Mr. Shan,
make way for homeport.
Aye, aye, Captain.

Dismissed!

Nice speech, Captain.
The short ones
are always nice.

Have you seen Lucas?

<i>No, I was surprised
he wasn't here
for the goodbye.</i>

<i>All this hoopla
about his father,
he's taking it pretty hard.</i>

Yes, his father may be
a great man, but...


<i>he's a strong boy.</i>

<i>The great man
hasn't been seen for a year.
I'd better check.</i>

We still on
for dinner tonight?
Absolutely.

About time.

[footsteps approaching]

Captain, the three of us
chipped in.
We wanted to give you this.

<i>(O'Neill)
It's a little something
to say thanks.</i>

Krieg picked it up.
At a shop in Singapore.

Wrapped it myself.
Did you?


You know, someone once sent me
a strip-o-gram.

I spent about a half an hour
running around my room
trying to get...

a nude geisha girl
back into the box.

<i>Thanks. I think I'll pass.</i>

<i>How did he know what it was?
'Cause it was your idea, Ben.</i>

He probably just started in
the sewer and worked his way
back up from there.

<i>Hello, Lucas, 
it's good to see you again. </i>

<i>I apologize that once again, 
I can't be spending
the holidays with you. </i>

<i>But I spoke to your mother, 
and she assures me
that you're doing well... </i>

<i>and that you're growing up, 
and... </i>

<i>[sighing]</i>

<i>Anyway, I can't wait till
this project is finished... </i>

<i>so that we can spend
some time with each other. </i>

[tape rewinding]

Yeah, right.

<i>Hello, Lucas, 
it's good to see you again. </i>

<i>[knocking on door]
I apologize that... </i>

[tape rewinding]

Come in.

<i>You missed my goodbye speech.
I'm sorry.
I had other stuff to do.</i>

<i>You don't want
to go back, do you?
Would you?</i>

<i>Look at what
you've done for me.</i>

<i>Now everybody's saying goodbye
and giving you
presents and stuff.</i>

<i>It's like
a bad birthday party.</i>

<i>Don't worry.
I didn't get you anything.</i>

<i>Well, that's all right.
You don't have to do that.</i>

<i>There will be another tour.
You don't have to
leave seaQuest. </i>

Oh yeah, yeah, I know.


<i>But now that he's done,
you know, still, famous
for saving the world...</i>

<i>he's gonna want
to show me off...</i>

<i>he's gonna want
to parade me around
like one of his projects.</i>

<i>... once again, I can't be
spending the holidays
with you. </i>

<i>But I spoke to your mother, 
and she assures me
that you're doing well and... </i>

That was my Christmas present.

<i>But it's the thought
that counts, right?</i>

<i>Do you want me to call him?
No, that's all right.</i>

<i>But if you do,
tell him I said, "hi."</i>

[door closing]

Dr. Wolenczak,
you have a call.
Not now.

<i>It's a Capt. Bridger
from seaQuest. </i>

[electronic beeping]

Ask if my son is all right.

<i>Is his son all right?
Well, yes. </i>

<i>He's fine.
Good. Tell him "thank you"...</i>

<i>but I can't speak to him
right now.</i>

<i>He can't talk to you
right now.</i>

<i>It's quite important. 
He says it's important.</i>

<i>Not now!
He'll call you back.</i>

What a dad.

[knocking on door]

Come in.


You look gorgeous.
Thank you.

Santa came early this year,
I see.

The crew...

<i>they're all giving me
goodbye presents.</i>

I know. This is lovely.

<i>I think I'd be very jealous
if anyone else saw you
looking like this.</i>

May I kiss you, Doctor?
Of course, Captain.

<i>I know it's a lot of money,
but we didn't get into this
for money.</i>

I did.
Honey?

Please.

Ben, how did you figure
there was money in this?

<i>I guess I should have read
the seaQuest
career opportunities brochure.</i>

They offered you
a lot of money?
Well, yeah, but...

<i>I don't see myself
on the bridge
of a supertanker.</i>

I could see myself there.
You need discipline
to run a ship, Ben.

I am disciplined.

[clearing throat]
So, Katie...

what are you going to do?

<i>I have been approached
for a captain's position
on a supertanker, too.</i>

No way, which one?

<i>The H.R. Clinton
registered out of Delaware.</i>

<i>That's the one
I was asked to captain.</i>

<i>Maybe they thought
you'd say no.
I haven't said no.</i>

But you could afford to.

<i>I don't know how to turn down
$400,000 a year.</i>

$400,000.

Yeah.

They offered you $400,000?
Yes.

They only offered me $300,000.

<i>Maybe they're willing
to pay more for a woman.</i>

Women make better captains.

<i>That is purely subjective.
It's a statistical fact.</i>

All things being equal,
women make better captains
of non-combat vessels.

A woman at the helm
has a calming effect
on her crew.

<i>Well, Ben,
there's another reason
you'll never captain a ship.</i>

<i>Don't write me off so quickly.
I could be a woman.</i>

<i>(Carol)
Hello, darling. </i>

<i>I've missed you terribly. 
Who's that?</i>

<i>My wife.
Sorry I can't be with you, 
but... </i>

<i>you'll be just fine. 
Your wife?</i>

<i>Just keep me in your heart. 
Can she see us?</i>

I hope not.

<i>[Lucas clearing throat]</i>

<i>How'd you like
my goodbye gift, Captain? </i>

<i>I programmed a way
to make your wife talk. </i>

Damn it, Lucas!
How dare you
invade my privacy.

I was just...

<i>I get it now, Captain. 
I'm sorry about your privacy. </i>

<i>We've got 30 miles of raw...
Take north quadrant off-line.</i>

<i>...coming off the North Mount.
We've got control seizure.</i>

[computer beeping]

Shut it down.

[people chattering]

<i>I can't.</i>

[electricity surging]

[people clamoring]



<i>[whizzing]</i>

[knocking on door]

<i>[explosion]</i>

Come in.

Can we talk?

Talk.

To your face.


<i>Your present to Capt. Bridger
couldn't have been
more thoughtful.</i>

It just came
at an inauspicious time.

<i>You don't owe me
an explanation.</i>

Well, I think
I owe myself one.

Do you mind listening?
No.

Nathan and I
have become very close
over the last year...

and when a bond
is established between...

two adults...

<i>intimacy,
and I don't mean sex...</i>

is something that...

adults need
in a relationship.

<i>That's your way of saying
I'm not adult enough
to understand...</i>

<i>what you're talking about.
No.</i>

I understand.

<i>And I'm glad
you and the captain
can share...</i>

whatever it is
you were sharing.

<i>I'm sorry my present
ruined it for you.</i>

<i>Then why is it that I feel
that you're angry with us.</i>

<i>Because "intimacy,
and I don't mean sex, "
is important to me, too.</i>

But adults always
put their needs in terms that
make my needs unimportant.

Your search for science
is more important
than my needs.

<i>SeaQuest's exploration
of the deep is more important
than my needs.</i>

<i>My father's pursuit
of an empire
that serves mankind...</i>

is more important
than my needs.

<i>"Wait in line, Lucas.
Stand over there, Lucas.
Take a number, Lucas.</i>

<i>"We'll get to you."</i>

<i>Look, however important
your father's work is...</i>

<i>you're absolutely right
to think...</i>

that you should come first.
Tell him that.

<i>I'd very much like to.
Oh, yeah?</i>

Good luck getting through.

[door closing]

[videogame bleeping]

<i>[explosion]</i>

<i>[aircraft whizzing]</i>

Hey, Captain.
How are you doing?

<i>I've been better, thanks.</i>

I wanted to come down here
to say goodbye
to you personally.

You know, I never even
thanked you for...

delaying your retirement
to come aboard this boat.

Well, it was a chance to serve
one more tour with you.

It meant a lot to me.

<i>I don't know what to say.
No, no, come on, open it.</i>

<i>I guess you're anxious
to get home, huh?
To see Helen?</i>

<i>It's been an emotional time.</i>

<i>That's the watch that
Hyman Rickover wore the day
they launched the Nautilus. </i>

<i>I can't accept this.
This is too precious.</i>

Well, sure you can.
I want you to have it.


Hell.



<i>This is very hard... </i>

<i>but I've fallen in love
with someone else... </i>

<i>and I realize
that the best part
of our marriage was... </i>

<i>how much time
you weren't here. </i>

<i>I'm sorry. </i>

<i>But you always loved the sea
more than you loved me. </i>

Wait!

<i>She's right, you know.
We only got along
from a distance.</i>

What am I gonna do now?
I mean, one part of my life
is over with...

and the other part just up
and disappeared on me.


[people chattering]

<i>Is there a problem,
Mr. O'Neill?</i>

<i>I'm getting a confirmed uplink
from every satellite
we're assigned to...</i>

<i>but nothing's coming back.</i>

<i>I was shut out
of the Internet. I'm not
getting anything back, either.</i>

Did you run diagnostics?
Three times.

I tried emergency bands,
private sector transponders...

and commercial broadcasts.

<i>Nothing's coming back.
It's like the globe's
been unplugged.</i>

<i>That's exactly what it's like.
The globe doesn't unplug.</i>

Have you tried Sat-Com?

Sat-Com, Nor-Pac First Strike,
even Conal-Rad.

Try the E-band.

Stand by for a UEO
Sig-Core E-band test.


<i>(computer voice)
Identity confirmed. </i>

<i>United Earth Oceans
Signal Core
emergency band engaged. </i>

Well, to be totally honest
with you...

<i>we're in here because
I'm still a little leery
of Lucas' hologram.</i>

So am I.

Do you regret what happened?
Not yet.


I talked to Lucas.

I think he feels
pretty threatened
by you and me.

<i>Well, you're really
all he has...</i>

<i>and it's hard being 17
and not having a family.</i>

<i>You're right.</i>

But do you think we could have
a nice, quiet little dinner?

Absolutely.
Thank you.



<i>What is it, Commander?
I wish I could say, Captain... </i>

<i>but I don't know, sir. </i>

<i>Look, Nathan, 
World Power's gone off-line, 
we've got a global blackout. </i>

But your redundant systems
can...

<i>Well, a power surge
has frozen us out. </i>

<i>Everybody's working
off generators: police, 
hospitals, everybody. </i>

<i>But you've got contingencies.
Dr. Wolenczak
is a smart man.</i>

<i>Look, we don't have time
for Monday morning
quarterbacking... </i>

<i>from candle-lit dinners. </i>

<i>The last I heard was that
Wolenczak is dead. </i>

<i>Because the last communication
we got from World Power... </i>

<i>was an automated report
of a catastrophic oscillation. </i>

<i>Lay in a course. Full speed.
Yes, sir. </i>

Try to get back on-line
with our old systems.

<i>It's gonna be weeks, 
if we're lucky. </i>

<i>Without power, this globe
is going to regress
in geometric proportions. </i>

Status?
On course.

150 miles an hour
and climbing.

Engines at full torque.

WSKRS on bow lock.
ETA three hours.

<i>(O'Neill)
E-band open and holding.
Are you all right?</i>

<i>Captain, my father... 
Noyce made
a giant assumption...</i>

<i>about your father.
Now you're stuck with it.</i>

<i>I know what that's like.
Yeah, and your son died.</i>

<i>I'll never be certain...</i>

and the not knowing eats at me
a little every day.

<i>But I'll tell you something,
you know what's helped me?</i>

What?
You.

<i>You can't imagine
how important it is for me
to have you here.</i>

Now I want you to know
how important it is for me
to be here for you.

I know. I know.
Okay.

[alarm blaring]

<i>We're off-line
and stabilized at zero output.</i>

<i>We're stabilized,
but the Earth isn't.</i>

Thermal indicators are rising.

Ocean temperature
will balance.

<i>(Rosenthal)
It's not happening.
It's just got to cool down.</i>

<i>It's not.
We've got to evacuate.</i>

<i>We can't.
The shuttle has dislodged
from the air lock.</i>

<i>We're going to die.
Probably...</i>

<i>and if
you're going to whine...</i>

<i>why don't you just
stand over there
in the corner?</i>

How soon until you can
get me communications?

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>And I don't know
who you expect
to communicate with.</i>

Just get me an uplink!

<i>Lucas, can you hear me? </i>

<i>Dad. Dad.
You there? </i>

Yes, I am.

<i>I don't know how long I have, 
but I want you to know... </i>

<i>I need you to know... </i>

<i>that you're my son. </i>

<i>And I love you. </i>

<i>Whatever's happened, 
I want you to know that... </i>


Two hundred miles an hour.

<i>This isn't a thermocline.</i>

Mr. Obatu, use target systems
to measure this.

Twelve feet wide beneath us,

Captain!
Three miles and closing.

Dispatch WSKRS.
I want a closer look.

Twenty degree rise.
We are at 90%%

<i>This isn't happening.
This ocean is cooking.</i>

Hull tolerance at a 105%% .

E-band.

<i>(Bridger)
Bill, we've got
an exposed river of lava...</i>

two miles wide running
underneath this power plant.

<i>We've got a 20-degree increase
in ocean temperature...</i>

with no sign of abatement.

<i>Can we salvage the plant? 
To hell with the plant. </i>

<i>Didn't you hear what he said? 
We're destroying the ocean. </i>

<i>A balanced ecology
doesn't mean squat... 
No, look, just a minute. </i>

<i>... when compared to
our cities collapsing. 
Guys. Listen.</i>

A rise in temperature
like this is going to
melt the polar caps.

<i>You're gonna need scuba gear
to stand on
the observation deck...</i>

<i>of the World Trade Center.
Your cities
aren't going to collapse...</i>

<i>they're gonna drown.</i>

<i>All right, let's go to alert
on all stations.
This is going to get rocky.</i>

[electricity surging]

Going to emergency power.

Maximize stabilizers.
Stabilizers full!

[alarm blaring]

<i>Mayday, Mayday,
this is the seaQuest.  Location

<i>Mayday, this is seaQuest... </i>

coordinates 15 degrees,
13 minutes.

Attention all personnel,
this is Captain Bridger.

Go to your emergency launches
immediately.

<i>We're abandoning ship.</i>

<i>I repeat,
we're abandoning seaQuest. </i>

Mr. Shan, go to
automated systems,
evacuate your helmsmen.

Aye, aye, Captain.
Penny, Russ, Susan,
launch bay.

[bell ringing]

Just giving up?
Some of us are.

<i>We're going to abort
the rescue mission.</i>

<i>Mr. O'Neill, keep E-band open
and then evacuate...</i>

and take the doctor with you.

Aye, sir.
No, Nathan.

<i>Kristin, don't argue.</i>

Mr. Obatu,
switch your systems down here.

Ortiz, WSKRS control
at my station
and then evacuate.

<i>Hitchcock, you're in charge
of the launch bay...</i>

and I want you out
on the last one.
Yes, sir.

[crew chattering]

What about my father?

Lucas,
the chances of survival...

Will eat at me
a little every day.

<i>I can't risk
sending anyone over there.
It's suicide.</i>

So maybe I die now
instead of a little bit later.

<i>Besides his old man might
be able to help us figure out
what's going on here.</i>

<i>Let me go see
if I can find him.
Chief, I can't.</i>

<i>Cap, I don't want to
waste away on some bar stool
in San Diego.</i>

<i>The sea is where I live.
It's where I'd prefer to die.</i>

Now hold on to this for me.
What are you doing?

<i>I'm trying to save my crew
and then, maybe my boat.</i>

It goes with the job.
Will you please
get on the launch?

If you do find my father,
tell him I love him.
I will.

You two, out!
No, sir.

<i>That's an order, Commander.
You can't save seaQuest
by yourself.</i>

Mr. Shan.
No thank you, sir.

[metal clanging]

Okay. I need some time
in my quarters.


<i>Okay people, let's go!</i>

<i>(man on PA system)
All personnel, 
report to evacuation stations. </i>

<i>(Carol)
Sorry I can't be with you. 
You'll be just fine. </i>

I know.


I love you, kiddo.


<i>I'm okay.
I'm not.</i>

[electricity surging]



<i>Jordan, quick, up there,
come on, let's go.</i>

<i>Come on, come on.
Dr. Wolenczak?
He's behind me.</i>

<i>Where's the seaQuest? 
Let's get out of here.</i>

<i>How's my son?
I don't know.
Is this everybody?</i>

<i>Dead. Everybody's dead.
We've got to go.</i>

I need to see my son!
He needs to see you, too.

He has for some time.


<i>We've got 'em, sir.
Good.</i>

<i>Hello, I'm Lucas' father.
Nathan Bridger.</i>

<i>Yes, where's my son?
Well, we had to abandon ship.</i>

<i>What?
I've sent them all up-world.</i>


This World Power project
was a noble idea, Captain.

Most of them are.
What will do
about this project?

<i>I don't know. I don't know.
We got to think of something.</i>

Take those people up top.
Cap, this is my ship, too.

<i>Chief, you've done your job.
Thanks.</i>

How are we going to close up
the ocean floor?

<i>Seismic activity. We've gotta
plug the hole, and it'll take
an enormous force.</i>

<i>What about
a million mega-tons?
That's our nuclear capacity.</i>

But how do we deliver it?

<i>We auto-pilot seaQuest
right into the heart
of this thing.</i>

<i>It'll destroy your ship.
Maybe, but it's
the only chance we've got.</i>

<i>Give me everything you've got,
Commander.</i>

<i>If these aren't false readings
that lava well's
at least 200 miles deep.</i>

Captain, what exactly
are we doing?

<i>We're going to dive seaQuest
into this lava well
and then we're gonna...</i>

<i>detonate her warheads.
What's the good news?</i>

That is the good news.


Come 20 degrees left
at half speed and activate
the automatic-pilot.

<i>Captain, it's time.</i>

Arm all weapons.

<i>(computer voice)
Thermo-nuclear
arming sequence initiated. </i>

Commander, on my mark.

Three, two...

one. Now.

<i>(computer voice)
Thermo-nuclear launch on-line. 
How long do we have?</i>

<i>I have no idea.
We'd better go.</i>

[electronic beeping]

<i>We've lost the auto-pilot.</i>

<i>No, wait. There's nothing more
you can do.
Tell Lucas he's the best.</i>

Captain, no!

Bridger!

<i>(computer voice)
Auto-pilot re-engaged. </i>



Look!

[crew cheering]

[crew applauding]

Lucas! Lucas!
Dad!

You all right? You all right?

<i>Where's Nathan?
Where's Nathan?</i>

Out there!



Nathan. Oh, Nathan.

<i>And now, for my next trick... </i>


[airplane whizzing]

<i>(Ford)
Look, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm still a submariner.</i>

<i>Face the fact,
seaQuest is gone.
I'll think about it.</i>

<i>There's nothing bigger
than a carrier, Commander.</i>

Yes, sir.

It says here
to include the names
of at least three persons...

who will recommend you
without reservation.

[car horn honking]

<i>Come on, guys,
it's just a recommendation.</i>

What for?
The seminary.

Father Krieg?
All right, med school.

Dr. Krieg?
Okay, a manager
for a fast food franchise.

Ah.

<i>Better. I'll recommend you.</i>

<i>(O'Neill)
Yeah.</i>

<i>I think I'm gonna take
that captain's position
on the H.R. Clinton. </i>

<i>What makes you think
there won't be
another seaQuest? </i>

<i>There'll never be
another seaQuest. </i>

You know,
this is depressing.

<i>It's supposed
to be depressing.</i>

<i>Ben, don't open the box.</i>

Come on, we can use the laugh.

Ladies and gentlemen,
live from Singapore.

<i>Each and every one of you
can have a great life, 
ladies and gentlemen! </i>

<i>The future is yours. 
The monies of the world
are at your feet. </i>

<i>Success is your birthright. </i>

<i>Personal power is
your destiny. Listen to me, 
I know what I'm talking about. </i>

<i>Three words, it-can-happen. 
Build it, and it will come... </i>

<i>one day at a time. </i>

<i>Who the hell is this guy?
I don't know.
It's supposed to be a...</i>

nude saxophonist.

[seagulls cawing]

How did it go?
Okay, I guess.

<i>Dad said even though
he's gonna be really busy...</i>

he promised to show up
for my birthday next year.

But I doubt it.

<i>Don't worry, Lucas, next year
is going to be great.</i>

What are we gonna do?

<i>Well, first of all,
there's a small matter
of building a new boat.</i>

<i>Hello, I'm Bob Ballard
from the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution.</i>

Scientists are working on
various ways to extract energy
from the Earth...

instead of from the sun.

In Hawaii, a small geothermal
power plant has been built
above the magma chamber...

<i>that's under the island.</i>

<i>In recent experiments
using our submersible, Alvin, 
we tried to extract...</i>

energy from undersea vents
thousands of feet
underwater...

in a world of total darkness.

<i>Join us on the next
exciting episode
of seaQuest DSV. </i>
