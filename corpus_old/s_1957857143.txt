Look, it'â€™s time we get serious.

I need to know
how committed you are.

You have to decide if this is
something you want to pursue.

And I deserve to know
where you stand.

It'â€™s trading at forty, Marty.

You know and I both know
it'â€™s worth at least twice that.

Next week we could be talking
double digits.

You gotta go all in on this one.

There is nothing to worry about.

We'â€™re talking minimal risk,
high reward.

I promise you,
if you want to diversify,

Hong Kong is where
you should be looking.

You made the right decision.

And, if you stick it out,

a couple
hundred thousand dollars.

Absolutely.

I'â€™ll call you first thing
in the morning. Bye.

Hi, Jen.

Emotionally unavailable.

How could he say that?

Look, maybe you just need
a change of pace, you know?

Why don'â€™t you go back home
for the holidays?

No, no, no.
I have way too much on my plate.

Clients are coming in
from Hong Kong,

and I haven'â€™t even started
the pitch book yet.

You'â€™re just throwing yourself
into your work

so you don'â€™t have to face
the real problem.

Some girls eat ice cream.
I dissect companies.

Just as long as I don'â€™t need
to stage an intervention.

Money never sleeps.
Neither do I.

Promise me, you will
at least try to smile.

Better.

Jennifer Moore.

You'â€™re a hard woman to reach.

Oh, hi, Abby.

Look, it'â€™s just...
It'â€™s been a rough morning.

What'â€™s up?

Actually, it'â€™s your dad.

He'â€™s fallen.

License and regi...

Shut the front door!

Jenny Moore.

It'â€™s me, Bennett. Fisk.

We were in church choir
together.

Oh. Bennett.
Yeah.

You still look good.

I was 275 pounds with head gear.

Nah, I was just
messin'â€™ with you.

Yeah, right!
Wow.

Jenny Moore. I never thought
I would see the day.

What brings you back?

My dad.

I, uh, have to
make sure he'â€™s okay.

Okay, well, any chance you
may be coming by the church?

Sure.

I'â€™m sure Pastor Avery
would love to see you.

He maybe even let you sing.

No, no, no. I haven'â€™t done that
in fifteen years.

Okay, well, promise me
you'â€™ll at least think about it?

Sure.

And do me a favor.
Try to slow down.

I mean, I'â€™d hate to have to
write you up one of these.

We would not want that.

All right.
Hope to see you again.

Bye.
Bye.

Dad?

Dad?

Dad!

Dad!

Dad!

Dad! Dad.

Dad!

Daddy!

Daddy!

Dad!

Oh, hey, Buddy.

Where'â€™s Dad?

Oh, Dad.

I thought you were a burglar!

Dad! I have been calling
and calling you!

I was cooking.

And I don'â€™t have
an answering machine.

Why are you here?

Because Abby told me
what happened.

Well, you tell her that
the old man is not an invalid.

It was just a sprain.

What were you doing
on a ladder anyway?

I always decorate for Christmas.
Your mother loved it.

Well, she is not here anymore.
I think you can let it go.

Don'â€™t talk like that
about your mother.

It was important to her.

She would like it if you didn'â€™t
fall and break your neck!

Just one accident, and you think
you can just drive up here

and tell me what to do.

Yes, I can,

if you can'â€™t take care
of yourself!

Knock, knock.

What?
What?

Whoa. Bad time?

No, Brad.
Come on in.

Hi, Jen.

What are you doing here?
What is he doing here?

He'â€™s my doctor.

Wow, um...
You look great.

Uh, you better leave soon

or you'â€™ll be stuck in traffic
all the way.

I drove 300 miles
to keep an eye on you.

I'â€™m not leaving.

Buddy?

Come on and help me get
the rest of my things.

Well, it was good
to see you again, Jen.

Okay.

Let'â€™s check on that leg,
Mr. M.

Wow.

Out of all the doctors
in the world,

you had to pick the high school
boyfriend who cheated on me.

He may have been
a lousy boyfriend,

but he'â€™s a good doctor.

Did he tell you
to stay off that leg?

It'â€™s my leg.

I think I know it better
than he does.

I can'â€™t believe it's still empty
after three years.

They tried to sell it,

but they couldn'â€™t let it go
after Jack'â€™s accident.

That was the year that, uh,

you were gonna visit
for New Year'â€™s, remember?

But, uh, some big deal
or something came along,

and you just had to work.

Dad...

Look, I can understand being
too busy for your old man,

but you shouldn'â€™t have
missed Jack'â€™s funeral.

He was your best friend.

Jack and I hadn'â€™t
talked in years.

So that makes it okay?

Guess I'â€™ll get myself ready
to retire.

Night, Dad.

Good night.

Do you remember
when we were growing up,

and we used to talk about
what kind of jobs we would have,

what kind of guys
we would marry?

I was gonna be an astronaut
and marry Lance Bass.

There'â€™s still time, you know.

You think the reason why you
dated guys like Brad or Porter...

Preston.

Whatever. Is because
you'â€™re actually

afraid of being attached
to someone?

I'â€™m not afraid of being
attached to anyone.

How'â€™s he doing anyway?

I don'â€™t know. He's probably
living it up in L.A.

I mean your father.

Aside from almost
burning the house down?

What?
When I got home,

the house was full of smoke.

I'â€™m surprised the fire
department didn'â€™t show up.

Wow.

It'â€™s strange.

He used to be so strong.

I'â€™m worried about him.

Alone in that big house.

I mean, what if I wasn'â€™t there?
What if something had happened?

What are you gonna do?

He needs to be
someplace comfortable,

where someone can
keep an eye on him.

He is not gonna like that.

No, probably not,

but I have to make sure
he'â€™s safe.

I can talk to David,
have him file some paperwork

and have you declared
his legal guardian.

Thanks.

What about the house?

I could quit my job
and run a bed and breakfast.

Oh, okay, well,

how about I have this couple
moving up from San Diego.

They'â€™re looking for a place
just like it.

They might even
pay above market.

Why do we have to get old?

Don'â€™t worry.
You'â€™ll find someone.

And one way or another,

things will work out
with your dad. You'â€™ll see.

I can'â€™t believe it's still
empty after three years.

They tried to sell it,

but they couldn'â€™t let it go
after Jack'â€™s accident.

You know, if you throw in
a coin and make a wish,

it'â€™ll come true.

Mom...
It'â€™s true.

Look, it'â€™s been here
a long time,

and it has granted
a lot of wishes.

Is it older than the house?

It'â€™s very old and very magical.

I remember the first wish
I ever made in it.

Did it come true?

Indeed, it did.

Go ahead, make a wish...

and your dreams will come true.

Hey, Buddy.

What should I wish for?

I know.

I will wish for...

true love for Christmas.

I guess I should'â€™ve been
more specific.

Come on, let'â€™s go inside.

Don'â€™t forget
to mail my letters!

Yes, Dad!

Hmm? What'â€™s this?

Sorry.

"Dearest Jennifer, I heard you
were coming home,

so I thought I'â€™d send you
a card welcoming you.

Do you ever find yourself
listening to a song

that takes you back in time?

This one made me think of you.

I hope you like it.

Fondly..."

"your Secret Santa?"

Seriously?

Jenny Moore?

Chris?

You still work here?

Uh, actually
Mr. Arsenault retired,

and I bought the place.

Wow! Look at you.

Mr. Entrepreneur.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, my God.
You'â€™ve got to check this out.

Our employee Hall of Fame.

Ooh! Those were the days, hmm?

That'â€™s unfortunate.

So, your dad said
that you'â€™re down in L.A.?

I am.

Wow. I just can'â€™t...

get over how stunning you look.

Hey, Chris?
Yeah?

It'â€™s not taking the gift card.
Oh, okay.

Uh, so duty calls.

Promise me that you will
stop back in before you leave.

You bet.

Good seeing you.

There she is.

Is that...

You are too big to be Parker.

I know. Time is flying.

Hey, Jen.
Hi, David.

Okay, Mommy'â€™s gonna
talk to her friend,

so why don'â€™t you and Daddy
go to the cereal aisle, okay?

Okay.

Nothing sugary.

How'â€™s everything today?

No fires yet, knock on wood.

That'â€™s good, I guess.

Yeah, did you talk to David?

Yeah, um, he'â€™s doing
the paperwork.

And if you'â€™re interested,
I have some booklets in the car

from when I had to find
a place for my grandma.

That would be great.
Thank you.

What'â€™s this?

Oh...

"To Jennifer."
Ooh, a love note?

Abby.

"Fondly, your Secret Santa."

Hmm, how mysterious.

I found it in my mailbox.
What do you think?

It'â€™s a cute card,
catchy song, nice handwriting.

Looks like you'â€™ve got yourself
a classy stalker.

You'â€™re not funny.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'â€™m sorry.

Let'â€™s go find something your dad
can'â€™t set on fire, okay?

Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

Dad, whose car
is parked outside?

Jenny!

Pastor Avery.

I just stopped by to see
how your dad was doing.

I heard you were in town.

Any chance we might see you
at church while you'â€™re here?

Well, I told Bennett
that I'â€™d think about it.

Ha ha!

You have a better chance
of seeing Elvis.

Well, I'â€™m glad to see
you'â€™re feeling better.

We'â€™ll continue to mention you
in our prayers.

Thank you, Pastor.

It'â€™s very nice of you
to help him out.

Hope to see you soon.

I am pretty sure you'â€™re supposed
to stay off that leg.

Skim milk? Egg whites?

Am I supposed to eat this stuff?

Somebody'â€™s gotta
take care of you.

Where'â€™s my chips?

What chips?
My chips.

You can'â€™t watch a game
without chips.

These chips?

Do you know what they
put in these things?

Artificial preservatives,
hormones, GMO'â€™s.

"Gamoes?"

G-M-O.
Genetically modified organisms.

What is this, Star Trek?

Here, have an apple.

I'â€™m gonna get myself some real
food with all the GMC'â€™s I want.

G-M-O!

And the only place you'â€™re going
is the living room

because I'â€™m gonna make you
something to eat.

This is elder abuse.

Keep your leg elevated!

"Dearest Jennifer,
I hope you'â€™re getting my cards.

To be honest, I wasn'â€™t sure
if you were ever coming back,

and I was excited
to hear that you were.

As for why I'â€™m writing, well...

I guess there'â€™s something
about Christmas

that makes me think about
the loneliness I feel.

Too often I think
we get so wound up

in our own lives
and our own work,

it becomes hard
to let anyone else in.

I know you work hard.

I'â€™ve always admired that
about you.

But don'â€™t you ever feel like
you missed out on anything?

Lately I'â€™ve been feeling
that I have.

Fondly, your Secret Santa."

Who are you?

The mailman.

Hey!

Excuse me.
My name is Jennifer.

I live at 14730 Winslow Street.

Look, if you'â€™re
missing any mail,

go down to the post office
and fill out a claim form.

Oh, no, no.
See, the last couple of days

I'â€™ve been getting these cards,
Christmas cards.

Oh, you don'â€™t say!
And this time of year, too.

No, no.
I-I... Excuse me.

I want to know
where they come from.

No stamp, no postmark.
Sorry. Didn'â€™t come from me.

Well, I was wondering maybe
you saw somebody put it in.

Never seen it before.

Look, I just got this, okay?

It must'â€™ve been there when you
delivered the mail today.

Ma'â€™am, are you aware of
Article 313 of the postal code?

No part of a mail receptacle
may be used

to deliver any matter
not bearing postage.

Now, if you'â€™ll excuse me,

I have about 722 Christmas cards
to deliver before 5:00,

and then I'â€™d like to enjoy
my glass of eggnog.

Do you mind?

Where did this come from?

Another one?

Did this guy
ever hear of e-mail?

Do I have a stalker?
Should I call the police?

And say what?

Someone'â€™s been sending you
Christmas cards?

But who is it?

Well, who knows you'â€™re here?

There'â€™s Chris, my ex co-worker
from the coffee shop.

He kept saying
how pretty he thought I was.

What about Brad?

Oh, don'â€™t even say his name.

He'â€™s been spending time
with your dad.

Maybe they talked about you.

He does not have a romantic bone
in his body.

Can'â€™t deny love, Jen.

You can if it cheated on you

with a cheerleader
from Holy Name.

Is there anyone else?

It'â€™s the cop.
What cop?

The one who pulled me over.

The one that was
in choir practice with us.

You mean Bennett?

I'â€™m gonna follow him.

I gotta go.

Wait, Jen.
No, don'â€™t. I...

This should be good.

It'â€™s gotta be him.

Oh, Jenny!

Hi.
Uh, Jenny, you okay?

No, Bennett, I'â€™m fine.
I'â€™m fine.

I just... I just tripped.

Okay. You should
be more careful.

I know...

Cleanup on aisle one.

So are you sending out a lot
of cards for the holidays?

Nah, but there is
someone special

I need to find a card for.

Oh.

Yeah, you know how it is.

You don'â€™t want it
to sound too corny,

but you don'â€™t want to come off
as a stalker, you know?

It must be
a really important person.

Yeah, very important.

Hey, Jennifer!

Hey, guys.

Did you guys see that some idiot

knocked over
the display over there?

No, no, I didn'â€™t.
Did you?

No, I didn'â€™t see anything.

Oh, okay.

So how do you guys
know each other?

Oh, we were in choir
back in the day.

She had the most
beautiful voice.

So, uh, how do you know
my boyfriend?

Your boy...

Your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend. Oh.

Yeah, we worked together
at the coffee shop years ago.

Oh, right. Okay.

Right.

You two...
You'â€™re a couple.

You'â€™re a couple!

Oh, is-is that a card?

I thought that we weren'â€™t
exchanging gifts this year.

First of all, yes, it'â€™s a card,
but who says it'â€™s for you?

Well, who else would it be for?

Oh, you guys,
you'â€™re so cute together.

I know, right?

Yes!

I better be going.

It was really good to see you.

All right, you, too.
Likewise.

Okay.

See ya.

She hasn'â€™t changed a bit.
Not at all.

Did you hear that?

I think somebody
went for the mailbox.

Gotcha!

Okay, okay! I get it.

Okay. Whatever.

You can skip that house, too.

Yeah, yeah, whatever.

Oh, no.

No, no, no.

Dad!

Dad!

Dad.

Daddy, please.

Buddy.

Not again.

Bah humbug.

So you fell off the porch.

I got locked out of the house.
I was trying to get in.

Where exactly does it hurt?

My back.

That'â€™s, uh, quite a collection
of Christmas cards

you'â€™ve got there.

Well, you treat someone
long enough,

and you start to feel
like a member of the family.

Do you ever send them yourself?

No. My secretary
handles that.

Is it tender here?
A little.

That song...

You know this one?

Uh, do you ever...

find yourself
listening to a song

that takes you back in time?

Look, Jen, I don'â€™t blame you.

You have every reason
in the world to hate me.

You'â€™re a beautiful,
smart woman.

I blew it.

Wait. W-W-Wait.

Wait, wait, wait, is that it?

Well, I'â€™d like an X-ray,

but it looks like
you sprained your lower back.

Is there anything I should do
to take care of it?

You can try not
breaking into your house.

That always helps.

Right.

After you'â€™re finished
getting dressed,

you can schedule an appointment
out front with Marilyn.

Okay.

And...

If you could ever find it
in your heart to forgive me,

give me a call.

You always were
one-in-a-million.

Come on, babe.

You know you'â€™re
more than that to me.

You'â€™re one-in-a-million.

Same old Brad.

Ooh!

Anything you want to say
to Aunt Millie?

Um...

You okay?

No, I-I must'â€™ve just
slept on it wrong.

I meant in general.
You looked a little distracted.

What'â€™s on your mind?

Uh...

When you first met Mom,

how did you know
that she was the one?

I didn'â€™t.

Really?

All that lightning bolt,
love at first sight crap,

that'â€™s just meant
to sell cards.

The trick is
getting to know them.

Trust me, when the right one
comes along, you'â€™ll know.

You know this, uh...

This, uh, organic stuff'â€™s
not too bad.

Thanks for the chat.

Oh, the mail came.

And, uh, the mailman
left a note in the box.

It said to stop stalking him,
whatever that means.

Anything else?

You mean, uh, this?

Get to know him.

I intend to.

"Dearest Jennifer, a funny
thing happened the other day

when I brought home
our Christmas tree.

Suddenly I remembered
what it was like

watching you decorate
your house.

I still look forward
to seeing it every year.

I realize I should'â€™ve done this
earlier. Years ago, even.

I wish I had the strength
to just pick up the phone

or march over to the house and
tell you how I feel personally.

But I don'â€™t know
what you would think."

Excuse me,
are you done with this?

Uh, sure, thanks.
Okay.

"I know you'â€™re busy.

You have your own life
in the city and a great job.

Truth is, I felt you
slipping away for some time.

I guess I didn'â€™t want
to lose my chance

before you finally stop
coming back here for good.

Fondly, your Secret Santa."

Do you have any
extra Christmas cards?

Sure. Why?

"Dear...

Secret Santa."

"Dear Secret Santa,

I don'â€™t think it's necessary for
us to hide behind our words."

No.

"I think the time has come...

for us to reveal ourselves."

That'â€™s corny.

"Who are you really,
Secret Santa?"

You write million-dollar
proposals for business deals

for a living,

and you can'â€™t handle
a simple Christmas card?

Just do it.

Just pick up the pen and do it.

"Dear Secret Santa.

First of all,
I wanted you to know

that I'â€™ve been getting
your cards.

You seem to know a lot about me,

and I have to admit,
you have a good point.

I think we do get so wrapped up
in our own lives

that it'â€™s easy to forget
the people who care about us.

I'â€™m not sure if you know this,

but the reason I came back
was to help out my dad.

He had a nasty fall while
he was putting up the lights,

and I'â€™ll be honest,
I'â€™m worried about him.

I'â€™ve come to realize
that this house

isn'â€™t the best thing
for him right now,

and as hard as it may be,

I understand what I have
to do to help him.

I don'â€™t mean to go on.

It'â€™s just that I guess I'm glad
to have someone to talk to.

Someone who understands me.

I know it'â€™s scary to open up
to someone personally.

What if they don'â€™t feel
the same way?

What if you'â€™re
wasting your time?

But whoever you are, I don'â€™t
want to lose the opportunity

to find the person
behind the words

and get to know you better.

Tell me who you are."

"XOXO, Jennifer."

Hello?

Hi, it'â€™s Jenny.
Listen, um,

I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

So some guy has been writing you
three letters at this point?

How romantic. I wish someone
would do that for me.

Okay, so now you want
a Christmas card.

It would be nice
to be appreciated

every once in a while.

Guys, guys, guys,
leave the drama for me.

Okay. It'â€™s all set.

So now if Cyrano decides
to write you another letter,

you'â€™ll be able to see
who he is.

Look, it'â€™s gonna be okay.

Don'â€™t worry about it,
don'â€™t stress.

Okay.

What are you kids
doing out here?

Oh, hey! We'â€™re just
talking about you, Mr. M.

How about some homemade eggnog?

Ah! I'â€™ll be right in there.

All right, all right.

Uh, look, those are nice guys,

but if you'â€™re looking for
something more romantic,

you might be running your flag
up the wrong pole,

if you know what I mean.

Come on, let'â€™s go inside.

So you do know.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

All right, sorry.

Nobody'â€™s going to the box.

That'â€™s impossible.

How did it get there?

"Dearest Jennifer.

Wow! I just got
your Christmas card.

I must admit, it'â€™s exciting
and even a little scary to know

that this is finally
a two-way street.

I'â€™m sorry to hear your dad
isn'â€™t doing so well.

I realize how busy you must be,

but I think sometimes
he feels left out of your life,

especially since you were
always so close to your mom.

I can tell he doesn'â€™t
want anyone to know

he takes it personally,
but he really does.

He doesn'â€™t always show it,
but he loves you very much.

I know we'â€™ve known each other
for a long time,

but I feel closer to you
than ever.

Being able to get my feelings
for you off of my chest

means a lot to me.

And whether you feel
the same way or not,

seeing you again at Christmas
would be the best present ever.

As my mother often said,

it'â€™s never too late
to get it right.

Fondly, Jack."

No way.

Dad, do you know where
my high school yearbooks are?

In the garage, I think.
Why? What is it?

Oh, my gosh.

I know it'â€™s a bit chilly now,
but come summer

I promise the pool will be
a huge hit with the kids.

It'â€™s absolutely incredible...
I need to talk to you.

Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis,
this is Jennifer.

She likes to barge in sometimes
without an appointment.

I'â€™ll call you later.

I know who sent the cards.

I'â€™m closing a sale.

It'â€™s Jack.
The cards came from Jack.

And these cards are, what,
coming from beyond the grave,

traveling through time, what?

I don'â€™t know.

Jack was killed
in a car accident

on Christmas Day,
three years ago.

Yeah, I know.

I went... I went to his funeral.

Do you think
I'â€™m taking this lightly?

You want my honest opinion?

Someone is messing with you.

They got his handwriting,
and they'â€™re manipulating you.

Yeah, but even if they did,

I had the camera
on that mailbox all night,

and no one ever came near it.

It'â€™s like these cards...
just appeared.

I saw David Copperfield walk
through the Great Wall of China,

and I can'â€™t explain that either.

Look, there'â€™s a very simple way
to get to the bottom of this.

Okay, what?

We'â€™re gonna need another card.

Okay, now what?

How do you usually
start one of these?

Um...
You have to sound delighted.

Tell him that
you'â€™re absolutely...

"Absolutely excited to hear
that you are my Secret Santa.

However, just to make sure
that it'â€™s really you,

I was hoping you might be able
to tell me something secret.

Something no one else
would know.

XOXO, Jennifer."

"Dearest Jennifer.

Sure! As a matter of fact,

I'â€™ll tell you something
you don'â€™t know.

Do you remember
your goldfish Louie?

The one we called Super Fish

because he lived
for nine years?"

"Do you remember the time
he lost weight,

and your dad said
he went on a diet?

Well, the truth is
your mom and dad

found Louie floating in the tank
while you were at school

and replaced him with
a similar-looking one

from the store."

Oh, Louie!

"Ask your dad.
He'â€™ll tell you.

Fondly, Jack."

You think
he'â€™s telling the truth?

Well, there'â€™s only one way
to find out.

Goldfish?

Are you serious?

It'â€™s important, Mr. M.
Do you remember anything?

Of course I remember it.

The thing wouldn'â€™t die.

You know how hard it was
to get somebody to come over

and feed that thing every time
we went on vacation?

Did you ever replace him...

with another fish?

Do you really think I would do
something like that to you?

Did you?

Fine. One day
when you were about eight,

you were at school,

and I found Louie floating
upside-down in the tank.

Oh, my gosh.

I knew how much
you loved that thing,

so your mother and I
went to the store

and bought another one
looked just like it.

Did you and mom
ever tell anybody about it?

No, just the guys at the store,
I guess.

Oh, wait a minute. Uh...

Your mom did mention it
to Jack once.

He thought it was hilarious.

Why?

1901.

got lost while visiting
the palace of Versailles.

During this time, the women
reported encountering men

with three cornered hats

and a fair-haired woman

wearing a light summer dress
and a shady white hat.

Now the odd thing is

that the details
of the woman'â€™s experience

were found to be
completely inconsistent

with the palace'â€™s appearance
in 1901.

Rather, the world
that the women described

was remarkably accurate
for 1789.

And the description of the woman

might very well have been
Marie Antoinette herself.

Now, how did this happen,
you ask.

Well, I believe
that at some point,

the two women had unknowingly
passed through a time slip

or worm hole.

They traveled 112 years

into the past,

and upon retracing their steps,

found their way back
to the present.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Who should I make it out to?

No. Actually, I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

What can I do for you?

I wanted to know
if it'â€™s possible

to communicate through time.

Why do you ask that?

Because the person
who'â€™s been sending me these

has been dead for three years.

Well, I'â€™d send a letter of
complaint to the post office

if I were you.

I would.

You see, these have just been
appearing in my mailbox,

and, um, well, we'â€™ve been
writing back and forth.

You'â€™ve been corresponding
to and from this individual?

Is that possible?

There is something called
non-local quantum communication.

In layman'â€™s terms,
it'â€™s a way to send a message

faster than the speed of light.

Right.

This is something else entirely.

Well, what about the time slips?

Like what happened
to those other women.

Look, now, nobody really knows
for sure what happened to them.

It could'â€™ve been a time slip.

It could'â€™ve also have been
a shared delusion.

Some suggest
they merely stumbled upon

a historical reenactment.

But when you were
speaking earlier...

Theoretically,
I suppose it'â€™s possible.

If what you'â€™re saying is right,

if that'â€™s happening,

isn'â€™t it possible to use this
to change the past?

You mean prevent his death?

I don'â€™t know...

what year he'â€™s writing from.

He could have two years left
or three.

We'â€™re talking about forces
we cannot begin to explain.

The tiniest alteration or ripple
could spiral out of control

in ways that we couldn'â€™t
begin to comprehend.

You want my advice?

If this is real,

if this is actually happening,

enjoy it,

but do not tamper with it.

Um, thank you for your time.

Wait. Just a minute,
just a minute.

Here. On the house.
On the house.

This is nuts.

Time slip.

Whoa!

Whoa!

It'â€™s real.

This is really happening.

"Dear Jack, you have no idea
how surprised I was

to find out
you are my Secret Santa.

But there'â€™s something about
these cards

that you need to know.

The night before I got
your first card,

I made a wish
at the old wishing well.

You and I spent a lot of time
playing near that well,

and we know that
it'â€™s a lot of nonsense,

but this time,
I believe my wish came true.

You see, these cards
that you'â€™ve been sending

are actually arriving
in the future.

I'â€™m sitting in my room
right now,

looking out the window
and your room.

Your whole house is empty."

What?

"You don'â€™t live there anymore.

And yet every day I get cards
hand-delivered from you.

The ironic thing
about all this is...

that just when we'â€™ve connected
or reconnected,

we'â€™re still separated.

I don'â€™t know how long
this is going to last,

but I'â€™m enjoying the ride.

XOXO, Jennifer."

"P.S. I'â€™m curious.

How long have you been
interested in me?"

All right,
what am I lookin'â€™ for?

Okay.

Read this.

"Dearest Jennifer..."

Do I really have to read this?

Mm-hmm.

Fine.

"Getting your card this morning

has made this the strangest
Wednesday I'â€™ve had

since I can remember.

After I read it, I went over
to talk to your father..."

"and he said you hadn'â€™t
even come home yet.

He said you'â€™re still
300 miles away in L.A.

I can'â€™t believe
this is happening,

but it seems that you'â€™re right.

You said I'â€™ve moved.

Please, wherever I'â€™ve gone,
find me.

I know I'â€™ve got
a couple of years to wait,

but I'â€™ve waited this long,
what'â€™s another year or two?

If we can'â€™t be together
on my Christmas,

then we can be together
on yours.

It'â€™s been too long,

and we don'â€™t need
to be alone anymore.

By the way,
to answer your question,

how long have I been
interested in you?"

"All my life.

Love, Jack."

What do you mean, Jack?

Jack.

You mean... Jack?

But he'â€™s...

I know.
Apparently it'â€™s, um,

it'â€™s a time slip
or a worm hole or something.

I don'â€™t know, but it'â€™s Jack.

Look, I made a wish in the well
the first night I got home,

and I asked for true love.

I got Jack.

Told you it was wild.

I can'â€™t believe I'm breaking
into Jack'â€™s house.

Go ahead, make a wish.

No. I think I'â€™ll save it
for something special.

Hey, why don'â€™t you make one?

You okay?

I never told you...

why I didn'â€™t make it back
for Jack'â€™s funeral.

Oh, sure.

I know how hard you work.

It wasn'â€™t fair of me
to go off on you like that.

No. You were right.

I should'â€™ve been here.

Everybody thinks
that I'â€™m this...

strong businesswoman.

The truth is I'â€™m a coward.

I couldn'â€™t handle it.

I lost Mom,

and you and I have never
really been that close.

And now Jack.

You know what my ex called me?

Emotionally unavailable.

Jen...

No, he'â€™s right.

I don'â€™t know how
to express my feelings.

So I ran.

I chickened out.
I stayed in L.A.

And now it'â€™s too late.

You know,
I'â€™m just a simple guy.

So I can'â€™t pretend
to understand,

but I do know somehow,

some way...

you and Jack have been
given a second chance.

And that chance
has allowed you to realize

that you'â€™ve had feelings for
one another for all these years.

And that is a Christmas miracle.

If I could ever write a letter
to your mother,

speak to her for just a minute,

that'â€™d be a gift from God.

Huh?

Come on, come on,
you got a letter to write.

Right.

"Dear Jack,
a couple of days ago,

Abby said I was afraid
of being attached.

At the time I thought
it was ridiculous.

But the more I'â€™ve thought
about it, the more true it is.

If only you knew how much
these cards have meant to me

these past few days

or how close I'â€™ve come to feel

to the mysterious Secret Santa
behind the message,

the man who knew me
better than I knew myself,

the man who, little did I know,

I'â€™ve been searching for
my whole life,

and to think this whole time
he was right next door.

As your mother would say,

it'â€™s never too late
to get it right.

Love, Jennifer."

"P.S. I went over
to your house today,

and I found your sketchbook
under the floorboard.

I hope you don'â€™t mind,
but I took it.

I'â€™ll take good care of it
for you."

Hi, Mom.

I feel so strange
not having you around.

When things are going good,

I wish I could just
pick up the phone and tell you.

When things are bad,

I wish you were there to tell me
everything'â€™s going to be okay.

I feel so alone without you.

I love you, Mom.

You remind me a lot of her.

You'â€™re not the quiet girl
I remember

from the choir anymore.

I know your mother would be
very proud of you.

It doesn'â€™t always feel like it.

She used to talk about you
all the time, you know.

When she was sick,
I'â€™d visit her in the hospital.

She'â€™d be braggin'
about her little girl

livin'â€™ her dream
down in L.A.,

how she'â€™d never
let anything knock her down.

Oh, yeah, she'â€™s proud of you.

The only thing about
you being so far away

was that she said
she missed hearing you sing.

She said that?

She always loved
listening to you in church

on Sunday morning.

Like an angel, she said.

Whether you realize it or not,

you came back
exactly when you were needed.

God knows it,

your father knows it,

and your mother knows it.

Do you believe in miracles?

Why?

These things
have been happening.

Heck, I would think I'â€™m crazy,

but I don'â€™t know.

I think I'â€™m starting
to believe.

I believe miracles
happen every day.

People just have
to stop and notice.

You think Mom would like it?

She would'â€™ve loved it.

Hey, this is Abby. Can'â€™t get
to the phone right now.

Please leave a message. Bye!

Abby, listen, it'â€™s me.

Look, I'â€™ve changed my mind.
I don'â€™t think...

Mailbox full.

You know, not long ago I went
to visit a man in his house.

The man had hurt himself,

and the doctor said he wasn'â€™t
supposed to move too much.

I said to him,
"Christmas is coming.

Have you given any thought
as to what you might want?"

The man thought about it
for a minute,

and he told me that
his wife had passed away,

and their only child
had moved out.

He said, "There is nothing left
to celebrate."

Well, I told him that as long
as there was life on this earth,

that there is always
plenty to celebrate.

Not long after we spoke,

the man'â€™s daughter
returned home

to help take care of him.

You see, God had not only
given him what he wanted,

but God had given him
what he needed!

And today she'â€™s here with us.

Praise God.

Jennifer Moore,

welcome home.

You know, I was hoping we might
be able to persuade her

to sing us a little song.

Yeah.

For your mother.

Fine, fine.

Jennifer, please.

I love you, Mom.

Got it?

You know, I'â€™ve been alone
so long, I, uh...

never realized how much
I enjoy spending time with you.

Dad, I know that all this time

you think I'â€™ve been
avoiding you or too busy.

The truth is, after Mom died,

I should'â€™ve been here for you,
and I wasn'â€™t.

I'â€™m sorry.

You'â€™re home now.

Just the way
your mother wanted you.

What do you mean?

The house.

She wanted you to take it.

What?

For your family.
She wanted it for you.

That'â€™s why
I could never sell it,

no matter how old
and decrepit I get.

It'â€™s yours.

Just the way she wanted it.

I had no idea.

Come on. Let'â€™s go home.

Yeah.

Watch your leg.

Right this way.
You'â€™re gonna love it.

Oh, no.

What'â€™s Abby doing?

So as you can see, the curb
appeal is quite tremendous.

What about the house next door?

It'â€™s kind of an eyesore.

I heard that the owner is
thinking about tearing it down.

You know, starting over.

Abby! I need to talk to you.

Hey! I didn'â€™t know you were
doing a Christmas thing.

It looks great.

You gotta go.

Abby, what'â€™s going on?

Hi, Mr. M.

You must be the owner.

Yes, this is my house.
Why? Who are you?

You never told him?
Told me what?

Dad...
What am I missing?

I sort of...

I asked Abby
if she would sell the house.

What do you mean,
sell the house?

Okay, you weren'â€™t
doing that well,

and, you know, eventually
I knew I'â€™d have to leave.

I told you your mother
wanted you to have it!

But I didn'â€™t know that.

You should have said something.

You should'â€™ve talked to me.

I know I should have!
I know!

I think you should go.

Mr. M., Jennifer is
just trying to help you.

I don'â€™t want anyone
trying to help me,

and I'â€™d appreciate it if you
all would get off my lawn!

Sir, you don'â€™t have
to be mean about it.

Fine! Merry Christmas!

Now go!

If you could just
give me a second to...

We'â€™re not interested.
Goodbye.

It'â€™s just a misunderstanding.

I'â€™m... I'm sorry.

Look...

Dad. Dad.

Is that why you came back?

To sell my house
out from under me?

No. I wanted to make sure
you were okay,

that you were someplace safe.

You mean in a nursing home.

They'â€™re called...

They'â€™re called
assisted-care facilities.

They'â€™re called nursing homes.

Do you have any idea
how happy I'â€™ve been

these last couple days?

That we'â€™ve been able to put
everything behind us?

That we'â€™ve had
this second chance?

Look, I was gonna
call the whole thing off.

I just didn'â€™t get a chance.

You know what?

I think you should leave.

Dad, I know I should'â€™ve
talked to you about it.

I just...

Just go.

Please, Dad!

"Dear Jack, this might be

the last letter you get from me
for a while.

I thought I was going
to stick around,

but the truth is
I made a mistake,

and I'â€™ve hurt someone's
feelings very badly.

I think the best thing for me
is to go away for a while

until things calm down.

I hope to come back soon,

and I'â€™ll hope that you'll
still be getting my letters

when I do.

Until then, I'â€™ll miss you.

Love, Jennifer."

And this is Jennifer Moore.

Jennifer, these are some of
the executives from Hong Kong.

Welcome.
Thank you.

Uh, Jennifer just got back
late last night.

Unfortunately her father
wasn'â€™t doing too well.

I'â€™m so sorry to hear that.

Is he feeling better now?

Yes, he is.
Thank you.

I'â€™m glad.

Will he be joining you
for Christmas?

I don'â€™t think so.
Not this year.

Um, she was just finishing up
a wonderful presentation,

which will pitch your company
to our investors.

Great. I look forward to it.
Wonderful.

Okay, well, I think
we'â€™re gonna be moving on.

We'â€™re gonna grab lunch at Avenue
if you'â€™d like to join us.

Oh, you know, I have
so much to catch up on,

but you gentlemen have fun.

Always working hard.
Okay, right this way, gentlemen.

If you need to be
with your father,

why don'â€™t you go?

It'â€™s not that easy.

There is an old Chinese proverb:

"When the winds of change blow,

some build walls...

while others
build windmills."

In life, it is better to be
flexible than stubborn.

Thank you.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

The strangest Wednesday.

For him, December 22nd
was a Wednesday.

That was three years ago.

Oh, no.

Hey, you change your mind
about lunch?

Can you take over
the pitch book for me?

Um...
Please.

Sure.

"Dear Jack,
what I'â€™m about to say

I was told
that I shouldn'â€™t tell you,

that there could be
consequences.

But I'â€™m tired of playing
everything safe.

There'â€™s something
you need to know.

The reason you'â€™re no longer
living in your house,

the reason
your parents moved away,

and the reason I can'â€™t see you

for this
or any other Christmas...

is that you were killed
Christmas Day

in a car accident
three years ago.

That'â€™s tomorrow.

Please do not go anywhere
on Christmas Day.

Stay home.
Work on your paintings.

I love you, Jack,

and I'â€™m sorry it's taken me
so long to realize that.

But please,
I cannot lose you again.

Wait for me.

We can be together soon.

Love, Jennifer."

Come on!

Wait.

Okay.

You can do this.

I wish...

I wish I could save him.

Jack!

Jack, I'â€™m so sorry.

Jennifer?

I'â€™ve been trying to call you.
Are you okay?

Did you go back to L.A.?
He'â€™s gone.

I tried to write another card.

I tried to warn him,
but he'â€™s gone.

Wh-What are you talking about?

Jack!

He was writing those cards
from three years ago, Abby,

the year he died.

I tried to write him
before Christmas,

but it was too late.

And now my dad
won'â€™t talk to me, Abby.

I lost everything.

Where are you now?

I'â€™m here.
I'â€™m in Berkeley.

Why don'â€™t you come over?
You can spend the night.

Are you sure it'â€™s okay?

Come on over. I'â€™m sure we'll
figure something out, okay?

Okay, okay, I-I'â€™ll be there.

Hey.

Rise and shine.

Abby. What day is it?

It'â€™s Christmas, silly.

I didn'â€™t miss it?
No, you didn'â€™t.

Are you here for my last rites?

No. Just making sure
you'â€™re okay.

How'â€™s she lookin', Doc?

Uh, surprisingly, not bad.

Your vitals look good,
and the X-ray came back.

It doesn'â€™t look like
anything major was broken.

Thanks, Brad.

Yeah. You take care.

Uh, I'â€™ll be right back.

Hey, kiddo.

Dad.

How you doin'â€™?

I'â€™m fine.
I'â€™m... I'm fine.

Look, I just...
I want to say I'â€™m sorry.

I'â€™m so sorry.

Sorry about what?

Abby, look, I changed my mind.

I don'â€™t want to sell the house.

What are you talking about?

I'â€™m gonna stay here.

I'â€™m gonna take care of you.

But what about you-know-who?

Who?
You know.

She'â€™s awake.

But you'â€™re...

They said you may have
hit your head.

You'â€™re here.
You know what?

I brought a friend, too.

Look, I'â€™m sorry I wasn't here
when you awoke,

but your dad needed a ride,

and parking around here
was a real bear.

You got the card?

I'â€™m just glad you're okay.

Hey, is everything all right?
Your heart rate is...

Thank you. She'â€™s fine.

They'â€™re having a moment.
Merry Christmas.

I'â€™m so happy you're here.

You know what?
It'â€™s like my mom always said:

It'â€™s never too late
to get it right.

I love you.

Oh, my God. I can'â€™t believe
how good it feels to say that.

I love you, too.

Is that for me?
It'â€™s for you.

This is amazing.

Well, I spent quite a few years
working on it,

waiting until I could finally
have the real thing.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.
