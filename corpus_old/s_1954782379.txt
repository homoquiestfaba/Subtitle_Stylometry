<i>Camille, Emma!
En place!</i>

Please God,
let him be the right one.

Please God,
let him be the right one.

Please God,
let him be
the right one.

Emma...

When your dear mother died,
I cried.

<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>how to raise</i>
<i>a little girl.</i>

A pig? Yes.

But you, with all
those ideas

in your head,
I could not.

<i>Charles, you are
a good man.</i>

<i>And a good doctor.</i>

<i>Emma's mother
can finally rest</i>

knowing I
married her well.

This was your mother's
favorite wedding gift.

<i>Please think of us
when you eat your sweets.</i>

<i>SantÃ©.</i>

This is Henriette.

Madame.

Would you mind helping
us with some
of these things?

Of course.
Let me, Madame.

Thank you.

<i>What's the matter, dear?</i>

It's all part
of nature.

I need to remove
my dress.

Oh.

I cannot remove
it alone.

<i>Sorry.</i>

Sleep, dear.

I didn't want
to wake you.

Stay with me.

It is the patient
that must find
solace in the bed,

never the doctor.

But all doctors
are husbands too,
aren't they?

Only in the evenings, dear.

Enjoy your day.

They're beautiful, Madame.

Thank you.

Are those
for eating?

Of course.

You must have spent
all afternoon on this.

You shouldn't go
to such trouble.

<i>Henriette is
always quick</i>

<i>to pick fruit
from the orchard.</i>

Is that what you
would prefer?

It is simply custom.

Fruit, please.

Any patients
of note today?

Any curious ailments?

<i>Curious?</i>

Um...

In the morning,
a patient needed
to be bled.

<i>On another,
I applied leeches.</i>

His, uh, wife
prepared me

a delicious mushroom
omelet for lunch.

Mm.

Oh, then yes,
in the afternoon,

<i>a patient had something
quite inexplicable.</i>

<i>I examined
his chamber pot twice,</i>

<i>but it remains
a mystery.</i>

<i>Madame?</i>

Monsieur Lheureux
is here to see you.

Oh, just
as everyone said,
simply beautiful.

That's most kind
of you,

but I must apologize.

It's not proper for me
to receive you

with my hair
in such disarray.

<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

Forgive me
for making haste.

I could not simply let
the day go by

without gaining
your confidence.

I was told you were
an elegant woman
of taste,

and well,
I am a man

in the service
of such women.

Whatever you command,
I will provide you with.

I visit Rouen
at least twice
a week.
You do?

Yes, I'm connected
to all the best houses:

"Trois FrÃ¨res",
"La Barbe d'Or",
"Le Grand Sauvage".

<i>Anything you wish.</i>
<i>Romantic novels,</i>
<i>chocolates, candies.</i>

Look at this.
Hm?

Simply beautiful,
is it not?

Yes, it is.
Mm.

How many
would you like?

Oh, I'm afraid I can't.

I've only just arrived.
Oh, and this, this,
this, this is...

Made of pearl.

<i>Carved in open-work</i>
<i>by convicts in</i>
<i>the West Indies.</i>

<i>They are lovely.</i>

Oh, but it's too soon.

I want to show
you something.

My father's
wedding gift.

Oh!

Simply beautiful.

We have
so much to share.

These, however,
you must have.

<i>These are woven
in Algeria</i>

<i>but the silk,</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>is of mythical quality.</i>

<i>Touch one, touch one.</i>

<i>Ah! You have
exquisite taste!</i>

Thank you.

Hey-ah!

Angel.

Look closer.
Look at these spangles.

Almost threads of gold.

They scintillate like stars
in the night, do they not?

How much?

A mere nothing.

It's lovely, really,
but it's too soon.

I haven't even spoken
of these matters
with Charles.

Ah, very well,
very well.
I understand.

I will leave you
some fashion journals

and a book
of fabrics.

You really
mustn't worry
about the money.

I-I can give you some,
if need be.

On credit,
of course.

I know Charles
is good for it.

On credit?

Yes, it means
you can pay me
whenever you like.

Now.

<i>This.
Beautiful, no?</i>

Mm.

Ah.
Maison Lheureux.

He runs the boutique
out of his own house.

That is the end
of the village.

Come.

Oh, I should introduce
you to Homais.

He's our local chemist.
We work closely together.

<i>...look at this
month, mm?</i>

<i>Ah, Emma!</i>

You've joined us
at last!

You're beautiful.

Ah.
Welcome to Yonville.

My dear, um,
Monsieur Homais,

<i>and uh, Monsieur Binet,
our tax collector.</i>

And uh, Monsieur
Leon Dupuis, our
legal clerk.

Madame no doubt has had
little time to rest

since her journey.

Well, moving
about amuses me.

I find it tedious
to always stay
in the same place.

I-I couldn't
agree more.

Not me. I'm most content
with the same slippers

and same fireplace
every night.

Charles, nothing is
more pleasant
than traveling.

You wouldn't say
that if you

were constantly obliged
to be in the saddle.

<i>You're wrong.</i>
<i>I-I would talk</i>
<i>of nothing else.</i>

<i>Just last year,
I was in Switzerland.</i>

You can't imagine
the enormity of
the valleys,

or the poetry
of the lakes.

It-it moved me
to-to such enthusiasm.

I was comm...</i>
<i>Emma, you</i>
<i>mustn't mistake</i>

<i>Leon's profession
for his heart.</i>

He-he-he might
appear to be

<i>just a legal clerk,
but secretly inside</i>

<i>he's the last romantic
left in all of France.</i>

<i>Oh, no, no.
It's no laughing matter.</i>

<i>I'm quite
concerned, actually.</i>

The other day,
I heard him singing

The Guardian Angel
in his bedroom,

and he was really
giving it his all.

There's nothing that
elevates my soul
more than music.

<i>Oh, not you too, Emma!
I need you to be sensible.</i>

I have a favor
to ask you, actually.

Of me?
<i>Hm.</i>

<i>I'd like to show you
something in the kitchen.</i>

Gentlemen, if
you'll excuse us?

<i>Monsieur Binet, could I
trouble you for the bread?</i>

Hippolyte here

<i>works at the inn,</i>
<i>day and night,</i>
<i>bussing tables.</i>

And he does
all this with
an atrocious impediment.

Isn't that
right, Hippolyte?

<i>Show Madame your foot.</i>

<i>See?</i>
<i>It's gruesome,</i>
<i>is it not?</i>

I'm sorry.

<i>Hmm. Now Emma,</i>

as a partisan
of progress,

it is my duty
to keep this town
to the fore.

Which is why
I need your help

to convince Charles
to operate on this
poor man.

<i>I believe I should be
convinced first, sir.</i>

<i>It's for
your own sake!</i>

Well, Madame,
what do you say?

I'm afraid it
is not my place
to tell Charles.

No. No, forget
convention and modality.

There are no risks here,
only advantages.

Uh, success.
Certain relief.

Beautification
of the patient.

But no less important,

<i>celebrity to be gained
by the surgeon.</i>

All of what you speak
of is most alluring.
Mm-hm.

But the decision
is not mine, it's
up to Charles.

Oh, very well.

But you will at least
help me convince him,

will you not?

We'll see.

Excellent.

I haven't devoted
much time to the garden.

It could be
so beautiful.

I'll take care
of it.

You've never thought
of a fish pond,
perhaps over here?

<i>You'll have plenty</i>
<i>of time to do</i>
<i>as you wish.</i>

<i>Best to come inside.</i>

Surely, it's for you
to enjoy as well.

<i>Well, yes.</i>

But not so early,
and not in this cold.

<i>Okay, one more.</i>

<i>This should be
the worst of it.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, it's
coming off.</i>

That's most
of it done.

<i>There, there.</i>

<i>I think you're good
to cover up now.</i>

<i>No, but that is once
you've done the operation.</i>

<i>The diagrams
are very detailed.</i>

Yes, well, you've never
seen anything like them.

They use
a hand here.

Now, we must
all understand

the future importance
of this machine.

This here
is a symbol
of industry.

It is a feat
of engineering.

Uh, notice
the treadmill

<i>gives a perfect regularity
of motion to the horse.</i>

<i>Here we go,
here we go!</i>

<i>But this configuration</i>

<i>seems extremely</i>
<i>uncomfortable for</i>
<i>the horse.</i>

<i>Well...</i>

When does
the animal rest?

They should have
two horses

taking turns,

<i>or some form
of schedule.</i>

Well, I suppose every town
has its diversions.

Is this ours?

Well, it
isn't Paris.

Have you been?

I have.

It's even better
than you can imagine.

It alights
your every sense.

Nothing at all
like Yonville.

I apologize.
I shouldn't speak that way.

You've only
just arrived,
and well...

To be honest,
there's nothing
to feed my soul here

but my very own mind.

I feel guilty
saying that.

No, don't.

Guilt will bring you
nothing, I swear.

When I was sent
to the convent
for my education,

I had a beautiful idea
of the piety

of those pale-faced women
with their rosaries

and their convictions.

I wanted to be
just as they are,
but I couldn't.

I puzzled myself
to find some vow
to fulfill.

At confession,
I even invented
little sins.

No, I was mortified.

I wanted only emotions,
not discipline.

Hm.
The good nuns
declared me

to be without calling
and cast me out

to read romance novels

and fulfill the desires
of the heart.

They made me ill,

but it was only later
that I realized

that my guilt
had been keeping me

from the happiness
I deserved.

And have you found
that happiness here?

Forgive me.
I did not
hear you enter.

Charles is visiting
a patient.

I'm not here
to see Charles.

No?

Of how may I
be of service?

Of no service.

I hoped you
might accompany
me on a walk.

A walk?

It's a lovely day.

I have
a gift for you.

I can't accept.

It's a trifle.

A relic from my days
in Paris.

Take it.

When I was a child,
I had a map like this.

Every night,
I would close my eyes

and trace
down the boulevards
and over the bridges,

imagining myself
in a carriage

passing all
the busy people.

All of them
with someplace to be.

Hm.

Hoo.

Well, that's
all I've got.

I win again.

<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

Do you mind
if we play another?

No. Please.
By all means.

Good night.

Good night,
Charles.

Come with me.

Um...

Please. I need
to talk to you.

Come.

I fear
I might be going mad.

I think
of nothing but you.

I cannot even hear
my voice in my own head.

I only hear yours.

I'm married.

Tell me
you feel differently.

...parents.
Now go back there,

sit down,
and stop messing about.

Charlotte, will you sit
up straight!?

Now all of you...

The young scamps.

They respect nothing.

You look pleasant,
Madame Bovary.

I don't feel pleasant,
Monsieur l'AbbÃ©.

Nor do I.
Might be what I ate.

Or maybe
it's the season.

Cold days weaken one
most remarkably,
don't they?

I suppose.

Yeah.
As Saint Paul says,

we are born to suffer.

I've known
poor young mothers,

virtuous women,
of course,

veritable saints,

who did not have
enough bread.

What of those,
Monsieur l'AbbÃ©,

those who have bread,
but don't have any...

Fire in winter?

Oh.
Does that matter?

Does it matter?

Seems to me
that once you
have a good fire,

sufficient food,
and a good husband...

Boudet!

I'll warm your ears
for you, you imp!

Talking of which...

How is
Monsieur Bovary?

Well, that is what I,
what I came to talk
to you about.

Sick as well.
Too much work.

We two are
the busiest men
in the parish.

I, the doctor
of the soul,
he of the body.

Oh, you're
most unwell.

<i>You should get home.</i>

<i>The first communion
will soon be upon us,</i>

<i>and I must make
these devils</i>

pious.

And I told you all
to stay still
and be quiet!

Now, look at me.

Did you know Leon
was moving to Rouen?

Homais told me
this afternoon.

He didn't give
much notice.

Homais was quite upset.

He needs to find
a new tenant.

Did he say when?

Tomorrow
or the day after.

I never noticed Leon
had such an impulsive
nature before.

<i>Shall I tell
the master?</i>

No, don't.

It'll only worry him.

It's just my nerves.

<i>This shall pass,
Madame.</i>

<i>You'll come
to like it here.</i>

I imagined that this
would be the happiest
time in my life,

but the calm here
in which we live

is not what
I dreamt of.

One after another,
the days come,

always the same,
bringing nothing.

Is this the will of God?

Is my future
just a dark corridor

with a bolted door
at the end?

Always in a book, dear.
You'll strain your eyes.

This book
is fascinating.

It's about
the Orient.

<i>Their manner of dress,
the rituals,</i>

even their medicine.

I could read it
to you.

You might find it
of use.

Those are
only curiosities.

They have
no application
in Yonville.

But we certainly won't be
spending the rest of our
lives here.

I would hate
to disappoint
you, my dear,

but I don't see us
going to the Orient.

Well, I know
that, Charles.

I was thinking Paris,
or maybe Rouen.

Do you really believe
a country doctor

can open a practice
in Rouen on a whim?

It's...
But you're not
a country doctor!

Very good, Madame.
Tighter?

<i>My man is opening
a practice in Rouen,</i>

<i>so we are currently
without a doctor</i>

at Vaubeyssard.
<i> Ah, yes.</i>

Madame Bovary,
I suppose?

You are blessed,

<i>my dear Doctor.</i>

<i>Ah. It's most
certainly broken.</i>

Emma, dear,
would you mind
telling Henriette

<i>to warm some water?</i>

Okay.

I was going to ask,

are you on duty
Sunday, Doctor?

Uh, no, Monsieur
Le Marquis.

I always spend
Sundays with my wife.

<i>That wouldn't be
a problem.</i>

We would, of course
invite Madame Bovary
to come along.

I'm hosting a hunt
next Sunday,

<i>and we need
a doctor on premises.</i>

So can I count you in?

Well...

Would... Madame
ride with us?

Uh, a hunt,
you say?

<i>Sunday...</i>

Uh, well, I see
no reason why not.

<i>Fantastic.
I look forward to it.</i>

Madame Bovary!
It's so good
to see you.

Beautiful as ever,
of course.

Charles and I
were treated

with the most
extraordinary invitation.
Oh?

The Marquis D'Andervilliers
invited us to a Chasse
Ã  Courre!

And you don't have
a tenue d'amazone,
I suppose?

This is going to be
very expensive.

You will extend me
credit, will you not?

<i>Money should never be</i>
<i>the problem, only</i>
<i>the solution.</i>

<i>My dear doctor.</i>

Please forgive
us for taking
Madame Bovary along.

I leave you
in excellent company.

By all means,
Monsieur le Marquis,

enjoy the hunt.

Emma could do
with the fresh
air and exercise.

As for me, a day
not in the saddle
is a day of bliss.

<i>I'm much happier here
with the buffet.</i>

<i>My dear friends!</i>

What good fortune
it is

to share this moment
with all of you today.

I cannot fully grasp
the reason

for my euphoria
this morning.

<i>Hunting is part
of my life and my soul.</i>

Who could live
more fully,

love more deeply,
or celebrate so well

as the hunter
with his horse

and his hounds, hm?

So now,
my dear friends,

on your saddles!

<i>Come in.</i>

Good morning,
Monsieur.

Good morning.

Madame.

What is it,
Madame?

You don't wear
a uniform.

No, Madame.
I never have.

Of course not.
It's my fault.

I've never bought
you one.

<i>I'm happy to wear</i>
<i>my own clothes,</i>
<i>Madame.</i>

Yes, but a uniform
is a proper dress

of someone
of your profession.

<i>Go see Lheureux.</i>

He'll dress
you appropriately.

<i>As you
wish, Madame.</i>

What's that?

What's what?

That box.

Ah. It's a cigar case.

I couldn't find
an opportune moment

<i>to return it
to the Marquis.</i>

You should save it
'til after you've
operated on Hippolyte.

I'll have this
returned to the Marquis.

I've been thinking.

<i>What's there to think
about, dear?</i>

<i>We must progress.</i>

<i>As Homais said,
there are only benefits.</i>

<i>No, there are risks.</i>

How do you think
the Marquis' doctor

opened a practice
in Rouen?

<i>He took risks.</i>

I would like all
of these curtains changed.

I want them to be made
of gold damask

with an embroidered
print of some kind.

I know
just the look
you want.

I would also like
new linens,

and two
silver candelabras.

Silver?
Well, surely gold
is twice as much.

Yes, but if you bought
one large gold candelabra,

it would fit
the table better.

It wouldn't cost
much more than
two silver ones.

Hm.
Hm.

Anything else?

There was
one more item.

<i>Well,
don't hesitate.</i>

I saw
a rug in...

<i>A rug!</i>
<i>That's not</i>
<i>drinking the sea.</i>

But what about
the dresses?

<i>We'll get</i>
<i>those too!</i>
<i>Stop dithering.</i>

Take it, take it.

Each moment you do
not possess what
you love

is a moment
not spent in love.

And a heart without love
is a heart without a voice.

No song, no life.

Do you like this
for the fair?

Doesn't feel
too austere, does it?

You look
beautiful, Madame.

<i>You have
such a figure.</i>

A spoonful of vinegar
with every meal.

After a week,
you don't even
taste it anymore.

Ah!

Doctor.
Madame.

<i>What a superb morning!</i>

<i>Yes.
Everybody is out.</i>

It's not,
uh, too cold.

Ah, my goodness!
What an amazing beast!

Remarkable.

<i>Ah, it's time
for the awards.</i>

<i>Well, I won't keep
you from the ceremony.</i>

Pleasure seeing
you both.

Good day.

Dear, would it bother
you terribly

if I ran home
to rest?

I'm feeling fatigued
but I'd hate to miss

this evening's festivities.

Are you unwell?

No, just tired.

Would you like me
to join you?

No, no, dear.
I know you
enjoy this.

Your note
worried me.

Are you
not feeling well?

In all truth?

I'm drifting
into depression.

You?

If only I'd found
some love,

I wouldn't have to act
such turbulent joys

or fling myself
into such fantasies
and follies.

As a woman,
I'm not permitted
such distractions.

Sad distractions.

For happiness
is not found in it.

<i>Gentlemen, may I be
permitted first of all</i>

<i>to pay tribute</i>
<i>to the higher</i>
<i>administration</i>

<i>to the government.</i>

<i>For friends, it is
my duty to pay tribute...</i>

Again, duty.
It's always duty.

I'm sick
of that word.

One's duty is
to feel what
is great,

to cherish
the beautiful,

not accept
the conventions
of society.

To some extent,
one must bow

to the opinions
of the world,

and accept
its moral code.

But there are
two codes.

There's the eternal,
the poetic, which
is ours.

And the other?

Sad... convention.

With all due respect,
Monsieur le Marquis,

we should put an end
to this discussion.

Then I shall-I shall be
something to you?

I can only offer you
my friendship.

<i>How dare you?</i>

<i>You come here to offer
me your friendship?</i>

Ha.

Madame Bovary.

Charles forgot
to return this.

You didn't come
here all the way

through the woods

to return
a cigar case, did you?

Please.

Well,

I have been thinking.

<i>Really? And what have
you been thinking about?</i>

Well, I realized
that before getting married,

I was contemplating
my coming life

like a child
in a theater.

Um, sitting there
in-in high spirits,

and eagerly waiting
for the play to begin.

It was a blessing
in my early youth

that I did not know
what was really going
to happen.

<i>When I look back now,
it seems that I was like</i>

an innocent prisoner,

condemned not to death
but to life,

and as yet unconscious
of what the sentence meant.

The longer I live,
the more clearly

I feel
that on a whole...

Life is
a-a disappointment.

Oh, my dear.

Perhaps you are
simply in need
of a confidante.

A lady friend
who could advise you

<i>in such feminine matters.</i>

<i>Unfortunately, I'm not...</i>
I came here
because I
need you.

I will not remain
standing inert

in this fever
of despair.

My dear Emma, you are
unrelentingly standing

under an apple tree,
wishing to smell

the scent
of orange blossoms.

So yes, you are
indeed standing inert.

<i>Lost in a world
of illusions.</i>

<i>You like to hear
the words</i>

but you have no courage
to act upon your feelings.

I do!

I do have courage!

Please, do not push
me away!

Yes... indeed.

It took you
a lot of courage

just to come here,
didn't it?

<i>Madame? Monsieur Homais.</i>

<i>Oh, Emma, Emma,
Emma, Emma.</i>

You are beautiful,
you are wise,

and you are magic.

I don't know
how you've done it.

Oh, it's all
Monsieur Lheureux.

Monsieur Lheur...?
Ah!

Forgive me. I wasn't
commenting on the house,

which is indeed
in exquisite taste.

No, Charles
has agreed to operate

on Hippolyte's
wretched foot! Yes!

This book contains
everything he must
know for the surgery.

Do not let him rest

until he has learned
it all. You hear me?

Yes.
Excellent.

And very soon,

you will be the wife
of a famous country surgeon.

What?

This is what you want,
is it not?

Of course.
Of course.

Study hard, Charles!

Do you love me?

Of course I do.

A great deal?

Yes.

And you haven't
loved any others?

You didn't think
you'd got a virgin,
did you?

Of course not.

But I love you
so that I could
not live

without you.
Don't you see?

<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of Yonville,</i>

you see before you
your great doctor,

<i>Charles Bovary,</i>

<i>who today
will finally cure</i>

<i>our poor crippled
friend Hippolyte</i>

of his most
ignominious of traits.

You may come forward,
but keep your calm.

<i>Remember.</i>

<i>Some more brandy.</i>

Come, come.
Take a good
slug of that.

<i>Good boy.</i>

<i>Monsieur Dubuc,
if you would hold the box.</i>

It must not move.

<i>We shall begin.</i>

Shhh.

<i>I know.</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Shhh.</i>

<i>Second incision.</i>

<i>Shhh.</i>

You're nearly done.

<i>You're nearly done.</i>

Despite the prejudices
that still invest

a part of Europe
like a net,

the light of hope
begins to penetrate

our country places.

Thus it was
on Tuesday,

our little town
of Yonville

found itself
the stage

of a great
surgical operation

<i>and loftiest act
of philanthropy.</i>

<i>Monsieur Bovary, our most
distinguished practitioner,</i>

<i>performed an operation
on a club footed man.</i>

Moreover, that operation
was performed as if
by magic.

<i>And barely a few drops</i>
<i>of blood appeared</i>
<i>on the skin,</i>

<i>as though to say that
the rebellious tendon</i>

<i>had at last...</i>

Uh, given way
beneath the endeavors

of the surgical art.

To progress.

To progress!

<i>Help! Help!</i>

I'm going mad.

He won't
stop screaming.
Alright.

He thinks
he's dying.
Calm down.

What's the matter
with our ungrateful patient?

He's having
hideous convulsions.

He struck the machine
on his leg

against the wall
enough to break it.
Yes.

Go, Charles.

You must ensure the success
of the operation.

<i>We'll return shortly.</i>

Well?

I removed the box,
but the swelling

is much worse
than I imagined.

Perhaps it was
a vulgus.

What?

I may have cut
the wrong tendon.

I'm worried
that if it, uh,

does not heal properly
and gangrene sets in,

then we will have
to amputate.

My love...
Don't touch me.

What is it?

This was
not meant to be.

You know
how much
I love you...
Stop it!

Calm down.
You're not
being yourself.
Leave me alone!

How can Charles
be so complacent?

He has no notion
of my torment.

If he'd even once just
tried to understand me,

I wouldn't have...

He's the cause
of my misery.

I wish
he would beat me,

so I might have
a reason to hate him.

<i>You're-you're here.</i>

Take me away.
I beg you.

Oh.

You can't do this.

It's reckless.

You're compromising
yourself.

You're married, Emma.

We could be married.

We could go live elsewhere.
In Paris!

You really are mad.
How is that possible?

Please! I thought
I married a doctor,
but he's not.

He's a butcher.
He tortures me.

I can't stand another day
of having to eat

while peasants cough

and recount their whole
vile medical histories.

Have courage.
Be patient.

I have been patient!

I've suffered long enough!

<i>You can't leave me
like this!</i>

Very well.

<i>Give me some time
to arrange some affairs.</i>

You look beautiful.

Henriette, will you
please stop crying?

Listen, you will take
good care of Charles,

won't you?

You have
to promise me.

He is a good man.

<i>Thank you.</i>

Who is it?

A gift
from Monsieur le Marquis.

<i>Monsieur Homais.</i>

<i>Forgive me, forgive me.
I had to see for myself.</i>

<i>A plum?</i>

No, no, no.
I don't believe that.

<i>That's extraordinary!</i>

<i>Yes, the irregularities
of the nervous system</i>

can be... perplexing.

Well, you know,
my friend Bridaux
has a dog

that, uh, goes
into convulsions

every time you
hold a snuff box
up to him.

<i>It's curious though,
isn't it?</i>

No.
It's not.

<i>You will wake Emma.</i>

Rest, dear.
Rest.

Here's the leg.

This should certainly
improve our friend's step.

The socket
is lined with cork.

It has spring joints
but function aside,

consider only
the aesthetics.

I did not order this.

<i>Oh, Madame Bovary
ordered it.</i>

And it was not inexpensive.
Three hundred francs.

<i>It's been
over a month now</i>

and she did not leave
a deposit,

so I will require
complete payment
right away.

Well, you may keep it.

Oh, I can't.
It's made to precise
individual measurements.

But I cannot pay you.

<i>Charles,
you are obliged to.</i>

Otherwise, I must
exercise the law.

I will give you
until spring to pay,

then I'll extend you
an additional 500 francs

on your loan to cover
whatever costs incurred
by Madame's...

Illness.
Illness.

Fine.

My dear Charles,
I think I may have

the cure for Madame.

Emma, are you familiar
with the great baritone
Romeo Fidanza?

Yes, of course.

Well, what
about him?

Oh, my closest supplier,

the owner
of La Maison Trois FrÃ¨res,

is holding a recital.

I have
a few invitations.

Only for my best clients,
of course.

This is exactly
what she needs.

To wear a beautiful gown,
to be herself,

and take pleasure
in what she loves.

Emma, think of it.
What a figure you'll cut

in that beautiful
silk gown, hm?

The one
with the bow
in the back.

Emma, dear.

You won't believe
who is here!

Leon!
What a coincidence.

Is this your first time
in Rouen?

<i>I-I studied medicine here
but it's Emma's first time.</i>

<i>First time</i>
<i>to a chamber recital?</i>
Yes.

And?
It was
absolutely beautiful.

What this
must mean to you.

So, tell
us, Leon,

how is life
in Rouen?

I've been working
at a rather large office,

getting excellent practice
while I finish my studies.

Have you found time
to enjoy Rouen's
cultural life?

Oh, yes.
I go to the opera
quite often.

I've seen
all the great tenors.

Rubini, Grisi, Periani.
I can't imagine.

Rubini is
performing tomorrow.

He is sublime.
You should come.

Oh, unfortunately,
I must be back
in the morning.

<i>In all honesty, I never
summoned the courage</i>

<i>to go to the opera</i>
<i>in the four years</i>
<i>I spent here.</i>

<i>I don't fully
understand the purpose.</i>

<i>Doesn't the music drown
out all the words</i>

<i>and make it</i>
<i>impossible to...</i>
Charles!

Do you wish
to stay, my dear?

We could meet
at the cathedral.

You must see it.

<i>Think it over, dear.</i>

Night brings counsel.

Hippolyte!
Give me a hand here.

How do you feel
with the boot?

Just give me some coppers
and I'll carry your bags.

That one.

Thanks.

What is it?

My father passed.

Oh!

I just heard the news,

and under the sad
circumstances,

<i>I thought I'd come along
and offer my services.</i>

Thank you,
but we can do without.

Are you sure?

<i>Yes.</i>

I beg
your pardon, Madame,

but I should like a word
with you in private.

<i>It's about
that affair.</i>

<i>I have been very good
to you, Emma.</i>

Weren't you glad to come
across old acquaintances
in Rouen?

Don't you think
your timing is
a trifle inopportune?

Your husband
is a good fellow.

Kind. Honorable.

What do you want?

Your debt
has become
quite formidable,

but you know that
well enough by now.

This matter
specifically relates

to your little... fancies
in Rouen.

His father
is not yet buried,

and you blackmail me?

Well, I happen to know
Charles has inherited

a plot of land
just outside the town

with 14 acres, so...

I could extend
his credit.

But in his state...

I think it better
if he gave you
power of attorney.

That way, we,
you and I...

Could continue our little
business transactions.

This one.

This one...

Not this one.

Dear, you are wrong
to get so impatient.

It's awful.
My fingers
have gone stiff.

I know.
Try again.

It's no use.
I can't get better
without instruction.

Don't say that.

<i>But it's true.</i>

The only teachers
are in Rouen.

Well, if you must,
take a lesson.

Ah!

How was your day?

Good.

I was admiring
this magnificent
new rug, Emma.

<i>Why, thank you.</i>

Has Henriette
not served you yet?

No.

Oh, dear.
You must be starving.

I'll fetch
dinner immediately.

What is it, Charles?

What has your friend
gotten into your head?

Homais?
Nothing.

<i>Lheureux was looking
for you today.</i>

He brought over a bill,
and I opened it.

Oh, dear.
Why did you do that?

I need you to know
that I do not make,

nor ever have made,
enough money to pay
what is due.

Please, dear. You upset
yourself unnecessarily.

Look around.
Look at everything we have.

The rugs,
the new curtains,

the chairs.

Really, Charles,
look at everything.

You must confess
that considering
the quantity,

the cost isn't too dear.

<i>Those are
all extravagances!</i>

I could have done
without them all!

But you enjoy it.

Do you not sit
in your chair every day?

But I didn't need
it upholstered.

Nor do I need
silk lining
in my jacket,

or pistachio cream
for my dessert
or oysters!

Not everybody
can be rich, dear.

<i>September 2nd,
200 francs.</i>

October 5th,
three-seventy-five francs.

November 20th,
450 francs.

There's no end
to this.

You owe me
ten thousand francs,

and you must begin to pay.

But I have nothing
to pay you with!
Oh, but you do.

Charles' inheritance.

It shall be finished.

What are you doing here?
Why today?

I had a horrible fight
with Charles.

I'm working.
I can't see
you now.

Come now.
You can slip
out with me.

That's impossible.
My master has already

complained about
my absences.

<i>This isn't like before.</i>

There's something
I must discuss
with you urgently.

Please.
It's of a legal nature.

Very well.
Wait for me outside.

I want you to grow
a pointed beard

like the Duke
of Normandy.

What is
the legal matter?

Let's buy you
a new suit today.
All black.

N-no.
I don't want to,

and more importantly,
I can't afford one.

How you care
for your money.

Yes, I do.
Very much.

Now, what is the legal
matter you wanted
to speak of?

Marriage.

Marriage?

Yes.

You are married, Emma.

Exactly.

You are going
to leave me too, aren't you?

You will marry
someone else.

You'll be
like all the others.

Like what others?
Emma, like what others?

Like all men.
Which men?

You are all evil,
every one of you.

I cannot
accompany you.

Leon, please.

I will meet you
at the hotel tonight.

Please go.

Leon!

You must stop
doing this.

But you never came!
I must speak to you!

<i>Do you know
what you're doing to me?</i>

These visits?

Every day,
I must reckon
with my companions

making jokes about me.

You twit!

You worry
about your fellow clerks
making jokes about you?

Do you not love me?

Do you not love me?
<i>Leon!</i>

This is
of absolute reproach.

You are ruining yourself
with a married woman.

<i>Dismiss her at once
or you will be dismissed.</i>

Yes.
She's just leaving, sir.

Who was that?

What have you done?

Who was that?

The bailiff.

No. No, no,
that can't be.

That's all wrong.

Monsieur Lheureux,

there's been
some kind of mistake.

A bailiff has just left
my house with an order

to collect everything
within 14 days!

Did you not
hear me?

A judgment
and a restraint.

Yes.
You must fix this.

I'm afraid I can't.
I was pressed for capital

and had to pass
on your debts
to a creditor

<i>in Rouen,
a Monsieur VinÃ§art.</i>

But you made
a promise!

I was being bled myself.
The knife was at my throat.

You simply have
too many bills.

One gets in quite
a muddle over them.

But surely,
good Monsieur Lheureux,

you can talk
to Monsieur VinÃ§art

and quiet him.
<i>Quiet VinÃ§art?</i>

You don't know him.
He's more ferocious
than a bear.

You could try
the Marquis.

The Marquis?
Yes, I hear he's back
from his sojourn.

Now, if you may,

I must send
these parcels
out at once.

Madame Bovary?

Are you here
to pay alms?

No, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©.

To confess?

No.

To seek counsel?

No.

Just silence.

Have you tried
a walk in the forest?

It never is
absolutely quiet,

but I believe
one can find

great silence
in the sounds of nature.

<i>Good afternoon, Madame.</i>

Charming.
Very pretty room.

Ah, correspondence.

Allow me.

Must make sure
you're not hiding
any gold coins.

Sir.
Madame Bovary.

You haven't changed
a bit.

You're still
as charming as ever.

They are poor charms
since you disdained them.

What do you want?

I am ruined.

I need
10,000 francs.

<i>Ten thousand francs?</i>

My husband borrowed
against our home.

We shall have
the money soon,

but today for want
of just 10,000 francs,

we are to be sold off.

I do not have
the money that you need.

You don't?

<i>I'm struggling myself.</i>

I pity you
very much.

<i>The least of these trifles
could get you the money.</i>

You want for nothing.

I don't have the money
that you need.

You made me believe
that you loved me!

For months, you held me
in the sweetest dream!

Do you remember
your letter?

It tore my heart,

and still I come
back to implore you.

But you just
look through me,

and disdain me again?

I do not have the money
that you need.

<i>What are you doing?</i>

What on earth
are you doing?

You put those back.

They're not yours
to give.

Emma.

Emma!

That can't be it.

It is.

Surely this is enough
for an extension?
No.

And with my piano?
<i>It's too late.</i>

<i>There's no way out.</i>

<i>The court
has made its judgment.</i>

Did you think, little lady,
that I would be

your supplier
and your banker

until the end of time,
just for the love of God?

But the amount
is far too much! I...
<i>And whose fault</i>
<i>is that?</i>

While I'm slaving
away in here,

you're gadding about!

And I'm the one
with the fickle heart?

Not a sermon, please!

It never does
any harm.

You are a wretch!

<i>Such a little hothead.</i>

I know
it's not very pleasant.

I'm aware of that.

But it never killed
anyone, did it?

And it's the only way
for you to pay me back.

But could you not lend
me just a...?

None whatsoever.

Mm.

You have been
an excellent patron.

And I have done
very well by you.

But in this state,

I do not see value

in this proposition!

Madame?

Madame?

<i>Mme. Bovary!</i>

Emma!

Emma!

<i>Mme. Bovary!</i>

Emma!

Emma!

Emma!
