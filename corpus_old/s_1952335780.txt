There was a time...

...not long ago...

where the great West...

...prior to century's turn...

...abounded in legend.

Oh, there were stories of fabled gunmen.

whose bullets always magically
reached their mark...

...and mighty stallions
whose tireless gallop.

...rivaled the speed of the wind...

...and glorious women whose beauty.

...stunned both mind and heart.

And in some cases,
a man became immortal.

Oh, it's not that lies
were told about him.

...or impossible feats ascribed to him...

...but every detail about him.

was seized upon and passed on.

with the most scrupulous
and loving care.

And in due time,
he will become a legend.

Oh, it has happened.

...to a few of the famous characters
of the mountain desert.

They become legends
before their deaths.

But nowhere in the vast spread
of the mountain desert.

was there a greater legend told.

...than the bloody tale of revenge.

...between Red Pierre.

...and the phantom gunfighter,
Bob McGurk.

Oddly enough,
the legend of Red Pierre.

...did not begin with his ride.

...from the school of Father Victor
to Morgantown.

Distant, many days of difficult.

...and dangerous travel.

Neither did legend
seize upon his showdown.

with Hurley and Diaz.

Though these things were
unquestionably known to many...

...they did not strike
the popular imagination.

No. What first set men on fire.

was the way Red Pierre
buried his father...

...at the point of a gun...

Morgantown.

If old age don't get you...

whiskey will.

You got some business with me, stranger?

I do.

There ain't gonna be any trouble.

...as long as you keep your hands.

...out of another man's business.

Game stops now.

Stand back from the table.

God damn you!

I ain't saying anything to anybody.

...about what happened here.

You was in the right.

I've seen everything.

You got a horse?
Huh?

Out front.
You got a horse?

Oh, yes, sir.

But, actually, it's a burro.

Then you don't mind me borrowing it?

No. No. No, sir.

What's mine is yours.

'Cause my horse died.
Otherwise I wouldn't ask.

Thanks.

Are you one of Jim Boone's men?

No.

Stand up.
What are you doing?

Tie me back up on the tree.

If they find me released,
they will slay me...

...tear up my insides, amigo...

...and kill my family.

Take this.

Take it and go.
Thought maybe I was dead.

Maybe I think I'm in heaven now.

May God grant you many riches.

They call it "gringo's desire. "

Got a $40 saddle on a $10 horse.

Horse...

On a saddle...

Sit down before you get all worked up.

All right. Tell me...

...as briefly as you can...

...how I got here
and who picked me up.

My father and his gang
passed you lying there.

They brought you home.

Who's your father?

Jim Boone.

And his gang?

Cut-Throats.

Keep your hands steady.

I got a nervous trigger finger.

Yep. Dad is pretty well-known.

What am I doing here?

You're here to take Hal's place.

My brother Hal.

He's dead.
He died last night.

Dad found you on the way home.

Brought you to take his place.

Makes me think, personally...

I agree with Black Gandil.

This is the worst fool thing.

Dad has ever done.

What do we want with you.

...in Hal's place?

I have to leave right away.

Tell me about Hal.

I don't know you well enough
to talk of him.

Sorry.

Well...

I guess that was
a mean thing to say.

I'll tell you about Hal...

...if I can.

You gotta tell me anything you can.

I gotta be like him, haven't I?

You could try till
the rattlers got tame...

...but it would take ten of you
to make one like Hal.

He was Dad's only son.

He was my brother.

Seems as if I was sort of stepping in.

...on a little family party.

Run along, Jack.

You ain't so growed up
as I was thinking.

Now, hold on.
Maybe you're more grown up.

Which is it?

You turning into a woman, Jack?

You're not as big as I expected.

You're older than I thought...

...but not too old
to be made what I want.

I suppose it's a pretty small chance
of my getting away.

Just about none, son.

The girl kept you pretty busy
trying to make a break...

...and if she couldn't do anything...

...maybe you'd have a pile of trouble.

with one of them guarding you.

Come here.

You must got reason.
I can see that.

Now, here's the point.
I know young men...

...because I can remember pretty close.

what I was at your age.

I wasn't any lady's lapdog, at that...

...but time and older men molded me.

...the same way I'm gonna mold you.

Understand?

What if I stop fighting
and call myself a member?

Then I'd know it was because.

...you were wanting something.

What is it you're after?

Two things.

Lad, I like this way of talk.

One, two!

You're quick like a two-gun man.

Now, wait.

Can I help you out myself...

...or do you need the gang?

I need the gang.

Then come along.

I'll leave it up to them.

Listen up.

This is...

What the hell's your name, son?

Pierre.
Pierre.

Red Pierre.
He'll be one of us.

...if he can get the gang
to do two things.

I ask, will you hear him, for me?

And then pass on
whether or not to try his game.

Here's the first.

I want to bury a man in Morgantown...

...and I need help to do it.

You heard me, boys.
Blood to start with.

I like that.

Who's the man
you want us to put out?

It's my father.

What the Christ?

He's already dead.

He's laying in his house
a few miles out of Morgantown.

As he died, he asked me.

...if he could be buried in a spot.

...he called his home
for a good many years.

He said that the grass
grew quicker there.

...than any other place
after the snow went.

That's a damn good reason.

It's a damn good reason indeed!

Who's your father?

It's Martin Ryder.

A ringer.

Remember what I said, Jim.

The shipwreck fella.

Pierre...

...talk soft and talk fast.

We all know Martin Ryder.

...had only two sons.

You're not either of them.

Not by the mother of those two.

She must've been a whore.
Shut up, Gandil.

Jim.

Why do you need us?

Because I'm likely wanted
in Morgantown.

I got in a little mix-up with Mac Hurley.

...and Carlos Diaz.

I knew Diaz.

Diaz was a badass.

Well, speaking personal...

I'm ready to go with you.

...down to Morgantown.

...and bury your father.

Shipshape.
Sí.

And with all the trimmings.

Morgantown will join in...

...voluntarily, of course...

...under cover of all our six-guns.

Hold on.

What's the second request?

Later.

It's a bigger job than this one?

Yeah.

In the meantime...

I'm your man.

Okay. It's a deal.

Hold on.

Loco weed.

Ándale.

No.

To the empty chair.

To the empty chair.

My son Pierre, here I lie.

with three chunks of lead
from the gun of Bob McGurk...

...and there ain't no way of doubting.

...that I'm about to go out.

I ain't complaining none.

I've eaten my meat to order,
well-done and rare.

Mostly rare.
That don't help me none...

...lying here with a through ticket
to someplace.

...that's farther south of Texas...

...and a whole lot hotter, too.

I just lie here.

...and watch the world getting dimmer.

...until I begin to be seeing things.

...out of my past.

That shows the devil
ain't losing no time with me.

But the thing that comes back oftenest.

...and hits me the hardest
is the sight of your mother.

...lying with you in the hollow of her arm.

...and whispering something in your ear.

...just before she went out.

Now, what exactly she whispered.

...is the subject of this here letter.

So I got an idea.

...that I had to write to you, Pierre...

...and try to set the truth square.

There ain't nothing
that can be made up to you...

...but knowing the truth may help some.

Poor kid.

Ain't got no father
in the eyes of the law.

Neither did you have no mother.

And therefore, ain't no name.

...that belongs to you by rights.

You see, your mother and me...

Irene...

we was young, just kids...

...but we was in love.

But the truth is...

I was married before I met Irene.

So there ain't no alibi for me.

But me being so close to hell now...

I look back to that time...

...and somehow I see
no wrong in it still.

And if I done wrong then...

I got my share of hellfire for it.

Who votes for death?
No!

Amen, brother.
Let's string them up.

You ready to die?
No.

Huh? You ready to die?

He's shaking already.

Oh, he's showing yellow now!

Oh, you was right, McGurk.

Let me ask you something...

You pig!

It's praying time, missy.

I warn you, McGurk...

...if you kill him,
you're gonna suffer for it.

I will never ever leave you alone.

...until you suffer for it.

Sweetheart, there's an end to this story.

...that I think you just don't see.

And you think I'd marry you, huh?

I'm gonna kill you for this.

You and the rest of them.

One by one.

I don't wanna punish you
for what you did to me.

I just wanna make sure
you don't do it again.

Over the next few months...

...the whole crew
had their way with Irene...

...and did most of what
they wanted with her.

...and to her.

She played the good little bottom dog.

...as long as she could.

It was H.A., the sheriff
of that lawless town...

who kept Irene locked up in his jail.

...a few nights a week.

Then, one night,
after many months of torture...

Irene began her oath of vengeance.

You dog!

And she was intent on doing
the same to the other two.

when she unexpectedly suffered.

...a fatal ending from cholera.

The other problem...

You just sort of happened along.

But I'll never forget that day, son...

...the way you looked...

...like you was lying in a red river...

when she whispered something
only you'll know

...in your ear.

Before she went,
she got ahold of my hand.

...and looked at me
with them blue eyes and said...

Bob McGurk.

No. No.

No, no, no, no.

No. Come on, Irene...

I buried Irene.

...under a pile of rocks.

Then I took you, Pierre,
and I knew I wasn't.

...no sort of man
to raise the son of Irene...

...so I brought you to Father Victor.

...and left you in his arms.

When I first saw him...

When I first saw him...

...he was a child, a baby,
"PRONOUNCED ZIN-ZUN-ZAN"

...but he came to me and took one finger.

...of my hand in his small fist.

...and looked up at me.

The smile of an infant goes to the heart.

...swifter than the thrust of a knife.

I looked down upon him.

...and thought many things...

...and I knew that I was chosen.

...to teach the child.

Another man would have
given Pierre a Bible.

...and a Latin grammar and missal.

I gave him the wild country.

...to say his prayers and patter his Latin.

I taught his mind
but did not forget his body.

If he is to go out among wild men...

...he must have strength of the spirit.

He must also have strength of the body.

...that they will understand and respect.

To make the body strong
requires thought and care.

Mere riding and running
and swinging of the ax

will not develop every muscle.

So I made a ring...

...and there Pierre works every day.

His boxing and wrestling teachers
have abandoned him.

The last man left with a broken jaw

...and a limp on one leg.

So, for partners...

I give him men.

who have committed small sins.

You got warned.

Don't ever say you didn't.

In all the history of our order...

...there is hardly a man
who will go out armed.

...like Pierre.

He's young, he's fearless...

...he's pure of heart and single of mind.

I speak from the best intentions...

...good Father.

This boy, whose mind is so clear...

...arm him with a single wrong thought...

with a single doubt.

...of the eternal goodness of God's plans...

...and he will become a thunderbolt,
indeed, dear Father...

...but not one
which even your strong hand.

...could control.

I've heard you, Brother...

...but we will see.

Father.

I have a letter for you, my son.

Well, son, here I lie...

with my wife's sons, Bill and Burt...

waiting for me to go out,
and when I do...

...they'll grab the coin I've saved up.

...and leave me to lie here
and rot maybe.

When I go...

I'll save them a seat in hell.

So I'm writing to you, Pierre...

...part to tell you what you ought to know...

...part because I got sort of a crazy idea.

...that maybe you could get down here.

...before I go out.

Vengeance is mine.

No.

Pierre...

Brave boy, look at me.

I...

I ain't no imitation man.

Even now.

But I ain't a ghost of what I was.

I lived...

Nearly sneezed there.

Ground's kind of moist maybe.

Like I was saying...

I spent the past 20 years
living a coward, Pierre.

But after all this time...

I set out for that McGurk.

Pierre...

I'm about to go out...

...but two more vengeances remain...

...and I can no longer deliver
them with my own hands.

First, find Mac Hurley.

He's now nothing more
than a saloon crook.

He'll probably be at Muldoon's...

...stealing the pockets
out of some poor fool's pants.

He's in poor health.

Be careful.
He's hired a bodyguard.

...to safeguard him.

Some say he's faster
on the draw than Bob McGurk...

...but that's just hearsay.

He don't say much...

...but when he does,
he talks with bullets.

How many men you got left?

You don't understand?

You don't want to talk to me, huh?

I have nothing saving one
great and terrible treasure.

which was predestined to you.

It has brought good
to all who possess it.

But for every good thing
it works for you...

...it will work evil on some other.

Great is its blessing...

...and great is its burden.

Do you accept it, Pierre?

Dear Father, with all my heart.

God, pardon the sins
you shall commit.

Stand back from the table.

Pierre, you don't owe me nothing.

...but harsh words.

But when I die,
touch my eyelids soft.

...and draw them shut.

I've seen the look
of dead man's eyes.

Close them.

And I know I'll go to sleep
and have good dreams.

Irene, I've come for you...

...because the time has come, Irene.

We have to ride out together.

We have a long ways to go.

Mr. Patterson.
Eat up, boys.

Don't be wasting
any of this good food.

Pork chops.
Give me that piece of bread there.

Rice. That's Chinese food.

I had Chinese food.
It's pretty good.

Well, we kept our part
of your bargain, Pierre.

We've seen your father
buried in the corner plot.

What's the second part?

Rob the bank?

Hold up a train full of gold?

I love trains.

Round up all the sheriffs.

...from here to the edge of the mountain?

Serves them right.

I know that one.

Roll all those together...

...and you'll begin to get
an idea of what I'll ask.

Pierre...
Well, look at Jack.

...I wanna thank you.

...for the gun.

Sit down, girl.

Sit down and be one of us.

One of us you are...

...by your own choice,
from this day on.

You're neither man nor woman,
but a shooter.

with every man's hand against you.

You're done with any hope of a home.

...or friends.

You're one of us.

Poor Jack.

My girl.

Poor Jack.

Shake, call it square?

To Jack.
Yeah. Here's to Jack.

To Jack.

You know, speaking of guns...

...there's only one thing
I can handle better...

...and that's a sledgehammer.

No, no, listen.
Now, a gun's all right in its way.

But for working a crowd...

well, you give me a hammer...

...and I'll show you a way out.

You give me a pair of sixes, Garry...

...and you can have
all the hammers you want.

Ain't nothing makes a crowd
remember its hell.

...like a pair of barking sixes.

Well, that may be.
Yeah.

That may be.
But once they've heard.

...the sound of bone crunching.

...under the hammer...

...there's nothing to hold them.

Oh, I wanna see that.
Well, maybe you will, Phil.

Listen, I've heard this story before.
Maybe you will.

You know, it was the hammer.

...that started me for the long trail west.

I'm lonely.

I'm not.

Yeah. Yeah!

And they scattered.

And I kept right on.

And I didn't ever really stop.

...till I reached the mountain desert.

...and you, Jim.

Well...

...that's a pretty good yarn...

...but I can tell you one to cap it.

Oh, right.

McGurk.

Sorry to drop in on you like this, Jim...

...but I'm afraid I've got
some unpleasant news.

Martin Ryder is dead.

I suppose you know

...he left behind two mongrel bastards.

I really don't give a damn about them.

I'm more interested.

...in another bastard that's cropped up.

As a matter of fact...

...he's sitting right over there.

...at your little family party.

I've never stepped my nose
in your business.

...in the past, Jim.

And I've never crossed you, have I?

Never.

Well, I'm afraid tonight,
Jim, I have to break custom.

That bastard has to go...

...and I want you
to see to it that he does.

McGurk, I'd... I'd sooner
cross the devil than cross you.

There's no shame in admitting that.

But I... I've lost my boy Hal.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know.
That was tough.

I knew him, you know.

From a distance, of course.

Pierre here.

...is filling Hal's place in the family.

You didn't answer me, Jim.

You gonna do this for me or not?

McGurk, you gonna
pin me down on this?

Why don't you take tonight
to think about it?

I'll be at Gaffney's place in town.

But I want an answer in the morning.

Gentlemen...

...let's have a toast.

To a long life
and much happiness.

Drink up.

I said, drink up.

Where's McGurk?

Where is he?

Haven't seen him.

McGurk!

Blood on the floor.

If McGurk is hurt, by God,
his charm is broken.

Patterson, Gandil,
go out back and look for him.

Rodrigo, take the door.

Gotta finish the job.

Son, it's a great work
you've done for all of us.

...if you've drawn the blood
from McGurk.

Those who are curious
about the period which followed...

...during which Pierre became known
only as "Red Pierre,"

...throughout the mountain desert,
you can hear tales of his doings.

...from the analysts of all ranges.

Now, this story.

...has only to do.

with his struggle with McGurk.

...and must end
where the struggle ended.

Now, the gap of two years,
which occurs here...

...is due to the fact
that during that period...

McGurk vanished
from the mountain desert.

He died away
from the eyes of men...

...and in their minds,
he became that legend.

...that lives still so vividly...

...the legend of the pale face...

...the sneering, bloodless lips...

...and the hand that never failed.

During this lapse time,
there were many who claimed.

...he had ridden off
into some lonesome haunt.

...and died of the wounds he received.

...from Pierre's bullet.

A great majority, however...

would never accept that story.

And even after
two years had rolled by...

...they still shook their heads.

...and awaited his return.

In the meantime,
the terror of his name.

...passed on to him.

who had broken
the charm of McGurk.

Well...

...not all that grim significance.

...passed on to Red Pierre indeed...

...because he never impressed
the public imagination.

...as did the terrible
ruthlessness of McGurk.

At that...

...he did do enough
to keep tongues wagging.

Old cattlemen love to tell.

...those familiar exploits
of the two sheriffs.

There was that thousand-mile pursuit
of Camby...

with its half-tragic
and half-humorous conclusion.

Or the sacking of Two Rivers.

Then there was that three-corner battle.

...against Rodriguez and Blaun.

But men could not forget.

...that in all his work...

...there rode behind Red Pierre.

...six dauntless warriors
of the mountain desert...

while McGurk...

McGurk had been always
a single hand against the world...

...a veritable lone wolf.

Uh, it's too late for business.

I'm a-closing up.

We're going to a bit of a dance.

We'll take those evening clothes.

Uh, they ain't for sale.
They's just samples.

But right over here...

This ain't a question of selling.

We're here to accept a little donation.

But right over here,
I've got a line of goods.

...you might be interested in.

You're Red Pierre.

I don't have time
to dicker with you, McGuire.

That's what the clothes
are worth to us.

I'm gonna take them.

It ain't possible.

Thieves beginning to pay.

Now you lay down
right there, McGuire.

Yes, sir... Yes, ma'am.

And don't you move.

...until you've counted up to 5,000.

Start counting, McGuire.

One prairie doggy...

...two prairie doggies...

...three prairie doggies...

...four prairie doggies...

...five prairie doggies...

...prairie doggies...

...eight prairie doggies...

...nine prairie doggies...

Pierre.
Yeah?

This dress...

If the boys should ever find out...

Never in a thousand years.

Are you ready?
Yeah.

How about a dance
with the girl, partner?

My name's McCormack.
Glad to know you.

I got a flask on me.

What say we make a trade
on this next dance?

How do we swap partners?

Mine's that ranger girl with the red top.

Not much on looks...

...but a Cayuse doesn't
cover ground on its looks.

Bill, she will rock you to sleep.

Who's your friend?

You don't know him?

Not any more than I do you.

I've been riding the range
around here for years.

He's new to these parts.

If I have ever glimpsed him before...

I'd remember it.

He'd be a bad man in a mix, huh?

Oh, look.
It's the Barneses.

...and that gal that's visiting them.

...from out East.

McGurk!

Haircut? Fifty cents.

A shave? Ten.

Shave.

Guess you wanna brush up
on the hearsay.

That fella just left.

...told me an interesting story
about the... The night.

Red Pierre shot Bob McGurk.

A case of cold-blooded revenge.

All stemmed from an incident
about 20 years ago.

Had to do with a woman...

...named Irene Melody.

Yeah.

You heard of her?

Her father made something in mines.

How many millions, though,
I'd hate to guess.

Well, anyway, along comes this...

...this smooth-talking Eastern
gent named... Named Bob McGurk.

Yeah.

Now, I... I ain't never even seen
so much as his picture, though...

...but they say he was
an unnatural-looking man.

The strangest...
strangest-looking face.

Well, he come up this way.

First thing straight off,
he sees this Irene Melody, of course...

...and he made a pretty big play for her...

which thrilled her father.

Well, being so smooth in the tongue...

...he finally got things fixed.

The girl's father had agreed.

...she should marry him.

But Irene didn't wanna marry him.

She was in love
with a fella named Mart Ryder.

Well, the problem was.

Mart was already married.

Rascal.

Well, one night...

McGurk and his gang...

...they see Mart leave town early.

...and ride away...

...and they follow him.

...over the hill to Irene's house.

They grabbed this fella...

...and they fixing on beating on him...

...giving him a beating he'll never forget.

Oh, this is where.

...the story gets all queer.

This fella wasn't the fella
they thunk he was.

This fella.

was an old friend of Irene's.

who had traveled
hundreds of miles to see her.

...before he packed up
his accordion off to New York.

Of course,
Irene didn't say nothing.

She was trying to protect Mart.

And that brings us.

...to how we started this discourse...

...the shooting of Bob McGurk.

...by Red Pierre.

McGurk was defeated.

...for the first time.

His charm was broken.

And soon after,
Boone's gang arrived.

The boys opened up
with their gats on them.

They chased him
right on out of the town.

They must've sunk
one of their bullets in him.

About a week later...

...a blind Indian woman
comes across a body.

Pretty bad shape.
Probably ate up by wolves.

...or coyotes or something.

It must've been McGurk's body.

And that was the end of that.

And this Red Pierre...
I suppose he's dead.

Dead? Him? Of course not.

The bullets hit him fair and square...

...but they... They ricocheted
off around his body.

...almost magic-like.

What?

What's wrong?

Well?

I don't know, son.
I'm just... I'm weary.

I'm weary with the kind of tired you...

...you just can't cure by sleeping.

You understand?

It's Patterson.

He didn't come home.

I said that when we found him.

A man that saves
a shipwrecked fella...

...he gets bad luck for his thanks.

You've been croaking
for two years.

...about the bad luck that I'm gonna
bring Jim for saving me.

Never happened, has it?

No?

Where's Patterson?

See him?

What, I'm responsible if the blockhead
got drunk someplace?

Patterson knew we were
starting up again today.

He knew it.
Ain't no doubt about it, Gandil.

And that is the straight dope.

Patterson never misses his dates.

Shut up, the whole gang, you.

We've had luck the two years
Pierre's been with us.

Who calls him a Jonah?

I do.

He's a goddamn Jonah.

I sailed the high seas.

I know bad luck when I see it...

...and you, mister...

...are bad luck.

The worst storms at sea.

...come when the ship sets sail.

...in fair weather.

Patterson...

Where is he?

Huh?

He's gone, Jim.

He ain't just delayed.

He's gone. He's dead.

He's the first one...

...but he's not the last.

He's just a start.

He's just a start.

Who's gonna be the next dead man.

...because of Mr. Red Pierre?

Is it you, Rodrigo?

Phil?

Dick?

I don't wanna take that chance.

Jim...

...are you a dead man?

Hell...

...it could even be me.

What makes you think
you know trouble's coming...

Gandil?

Because my blood runs cold in me.

when I look at you.

I've put up with your croaking
for too long.

Not gonna do it anymore.
Too long, you understand?

I'll be croaking.

And I'll keep on croaking.

...until you're gone.

You shrewd about that?
Don't answer him, Pierre.

You, Gandil...

...shut your face,
or I'll break you in two.

Try it.

Come on, Jim. Try it!

Keep out of it.

This is my party.

You'll stop your jabbering.

Know why, Gandil?
Why is that?

'Cause that cold in your blood...

...that's part hate...

...but it's more fear.

Ándale, Rodrigo.

Oh, God.

A bunch of bullshit.

Hey, you're about to get stung there...

Rodrigo.

What?
Jim...

Look over there
at that wasp there, see?

He's telling a story.

What's he say?

Look at it. See?
Look how he's flying there.

Look. See?

He's, uh...

He's sending word off
to the other wasps.

while he's flying there.

See that little bitty
twisty circle there?

That means one thing.
And then all the...

That big old perfect circle
right there...

...that means something else, see?

He's sending word off to his gang.

Yeah, he is.

And what is the message?

You're about to get stung.

Where do you come up with that?

I didn't come up with it.

I just know it.

How do you just know it?

Rodrigo, it's just something I know.

You been around bees as much as I have,
you get to know them.

You raise hell enough.

Now let's go get Jack
and ask her for that dance, huh?

The good days are done.

He'll never rest
till one of them is dead.

And then the others will take sides...

...and there'll be gunplay tonight.

Two years...

...and then the breakup.

Wipe that wolf look off your face.

Jack's a woman...

...not a gunfighter.

Grace up.
I got news for you.

I brought Pierre here to tell you about it.

What?

There's a dance
down at the Barnes' place...

...and Pierre wants you to go with him.

Pierre?

Yeah, Dick's lost his head
about some girl from the East...

...and he wants me to go and see her.

He thought that you might want
to come along.

I guess.

It's a masquerade.

We need clothes.

When did you spend time.

with this wasp?

Let's just say
I've been around them.

What do you mean by that?

I don't need to explain it.

Okay. Okay. I see.

You know what he's saying now?

What?
He's saying...

"Fir branch,
Rodrigo's going to shoot me. "

Yeah?

Well, you couldn't hit him
in a million years.

Watch me.
You'll never hit him.

I've seen how you shoot.

You got the money to cover that bet?
I don't need it.

You're not gonna hit him.

You hear what I'm saying?

I told you.
You couldn't hit shit.

You're terrible.

You know what I say?

What?

What do you say, Rodrigo?

I'm going to shoot you.

Yeah, right.
Well, with the way you shoot...

I better give you my gun, too.

...chingada.

"Chingada. "

I thought you two were at it now.

We are about to go at it.

Yeah, well, knock it off,
both of you.

We got enough trouble
with Gandil and Red.

All right. We're sorry, chief.

Two years, McGurk was gone.

Wasn't a whisper of his name.

Then he came back
and went on the trail of Pierre.

Whatever it was
kept him away for those years...

...the memory of that wound
he received at Gaffney's place...

...that never left him.

Uh, it's too late for business.
I'm a-closing up.

We're going to a bit of a dance.

We'll take those evening clothes.

Look.

What do we say?
We were dancing?

How do we swap partners?

Mine's that ranger girl
with the red top.

Not much on looks...

...but a Cayuse doesn't
cover ground on his looks.

Bill, she will rock you to sleep.

I could kill you right now...

...but I'd rather wait.

Who's your friend?

You don't know him?

Not anymore than I do you.

I've been riding the range
around here for years.

He's new to these parts.

If I have ever glimpsed him before...

I'd remember it.

He'd be a bad man in a mix, huh?

Let me mark your face,
you coward.

Is that... Is that Red Pierre?

What have you gone and done?

Wow.

Look at you.

What do you think?

Wow.

Find you sitting here
all by your lonesome.

Yeah, that's water.

All right.
So, I'll take the first sip.

It was delicious.

You want a sip? Do you?

Not the mouth.

Just right there. Yeah.

Yeah, I'm gonna take another.

Yeah.

Yeah, let's get rid of all this.

Well, that was fun.

You know what I'm thinking?

I'm thinking you should've killed me.

when you had a chance.

Damn you, Gandil.

Me? Don't damn me.

You should damn that Jonah luck.

...you brought into Jim Boone.

...and the gang.

That's who you should damn.

Oh, if you haven't heard...

...they're dead.

All of them.

Gone.

Just the buzzards to bury them.

Tragedy.

Now...

...you're gonna get your turn to die.

I'm gonna help you.

I think I'm the right man
for the job.

See...

I am going to kill you dead.

That's what we're gonna do.

You know, Gandil, you were always.

...spotting off about
how fast you pull a gun...

...how straight you shoot.

What of it?

Why don't you give me a break?

Make it even.

We'll try you out.

I'm not a fool, Pierre.

But still...

I won't go at you unarmed
and murder you.

I'll make an equal match of it.

Give you a fighting chance,
'cause that's who I am.

Now let's get your ass up.
Come on.

Get up. Get up.

Yes.

Yeah, you see?

Because I face
my challenges head-on.

...like a train going down the tracks.

I love trains.

Robbing... Trains.

Yeah. Yeah.

Remember this?

Do you?

Yeah, you do, don't you?

Yeah.

There you go.

Now...

we're even.

Even for who?

For me, you dumbass.

You're gonna die.

Oh, and as you do that,
I want you to know

...that that goddamn Jonah luck...

...it's gonna dissolve into the smoke...

...it's gonna disappear.

You see, the way it works...

When you die...

...it dies with you.

So let's go ahead
and get this thing going.

One...

...two...

...thr...

Four...

...five...

...six...

...seven...

...eight...

...nine, ten.

All right...

Red Pierre.

Go ahead and draw first.

When you're ready, Gandil.

Make the first move.

I've never formed a habit.

How'd you do that?

Hola, amigo.

Seems you've been through it all right.

Yeah.

I've been through it.

I said, who are you?

I'm Red Pierre.

Red Pierre, huh?

There's a price on your head, you know?

There's a man.

who wants to meet you.

What man?

A gringo with a white horse.

Where is he?

He said you'd know.

Well, it's only square.

The devil will know.

Get off that.

You ready to die, McGurk?

What man isn't?

I just wonder how one death
can repay back.

...all you've done.

I want you to die, McGurk.

Is that all you want?

No.

I want you to die
knowing that another man.

was faster on the draw
and straighter with his bullets.

...than you are.

Listen.
Your horse grows restive.

Perhaps we stand here and wait...

with our arms folded...

...till the next time your horse
paws the rocks.

Where's your gun?

There's mine.

Let's do better now.

You can't move.

I understand.

You see, it's fear
that stiffens your back.

...and runs chills
up and down your blood.

It's fear that makes you think back
to all your murders, McGurk...

...one by one.

You're done for, McGurk.

You're through.

I could kill you right now...

...but there wouldn't be any
lasting satisfaction in that.

Mart...

...his father is...

...is...

Bob McGurk.

Boy's mine.

You can go.

Go!

Now get out.

Swear to me, Pierre...

...you will no longer abuse its power.

...after your mission's complete.

I swear.

What are you doing?

This cross has power.

And Gandil's wrong.

Ma'am, You're going to die.

Behave, for the love of your life.

4,998 prairie doggies...

To hell with this.
