<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

<i>...it's a pleasure for me to be here</i>
<i>on such a beautiful day...</i>

<i>...in the great city of Detroit.</i>

<i>And l'd love to tell you all...</i>

<i>...to sit back, relax and enjoy yourselves.</i>

<i>l'd love to...</i>

<i>...but unfortunately, l can't do that.</i>

<i>There's a very serious issue spiraling</i>
<i>out of control in this country.</i>

<i>lllegal handguns ending up</i>
<i>in the hands of our children.</i>

<i>lnstead ofreading offstatistics</i>
<i>that you might not already know...</i>

<i>...that last year, more preschoolers died</i>
<i>from guns than police officers...</i>

<i>...or that gunshot wounds</i>
<i>are the second leading cause of death...</i>

<i>...for all people in the U.S., ages 10 to 34.</i>

Hold it<i>.</i> Go on in<i>.</i>

<i>While he lay bleeding to death</i>
<i>for 40 minutes, waiting for help to come.</i>

<i>Darren was 16 years old.</i>

<i>That could've been any one</i>
<i>of your children.</i>

<i>l hope you'll consider my four</i>-<i>year plan</i>
<i>to get guns off the streets.</i>

<i>l need your help and your support.</i>

<i>Let's stop the pain and suffering</i>
<i>Darren's family had to go through.</i>

<i>God bless you and thank you.</i>

-He just loves pissing me off<i>.</i>
-l'm sure he has his reasons<i>.</i>

Thanks a lot<i>.</i>

Thank you<i>.</i>

Relax<i>.</i>

l'll talk to him<i>.</i>

Thank you, everybody<i>.</i>

How are you? Good to see you<i>.</i>

Mr<i>.</i> Vice President, sir?

Bobby, what the hell is this?

You believe this guy?

Sorry, the bridge is closed
until the V<i>.</i>P<i>.</i> gets across<i>.</i>

You can't stay here<i>.</i>
You have to move it out<i>.</i>

-Shit!
-Get down, sir!

Get us out of here!

Excuse me<i>.</i>

<i>Officers need help!</i>
<i>On the bridge! Shots fired!</i>

<i>Warn the D.P., they are dressed as cops!</i>
<i>Repeat: They are dressed as cops!</i>

<i>Alpha six to Bravo Air, keep cover</i>--

-Stay down!
-What the hell is going on?

<i>No cops on the bridge.</i>
<i>We can't tell who's who.</i>

<i>No Detroit P.D., Secret Service only.</i>

Officers need help<i>.</i>
Motorcade's under attack!

<i>All units, stay off the bridge,</i>
<i>as per Secret Service.</i>

<i>All units stay offbridge</i>--

Goddamn it, l told you to clear the bridge!

Bring the truck in!

Goddamn it! Secret Service only!

Who the hell is that?

Get me out!

-Get me out of here!
-Get in<i>.</i>

Who the hell are you? Off the bridge<i>.</i>

We're not moving till the transport arrives<i>.</i>

l'm not talking to you!
Mr<i>.</i> Vice President, get in here!

We need help here now!

<i>Alpha one to Alpha six.</i>

Move it out! Everything's under control!

Jesus!

<i>Take out the Alpha vehicle!</i>

l'm sorry, sir<i>.</i> l got to do this<i>.</i>

Shit! l can't swim<i>.</i>

Don't move!

Freeze!

lt's okay<i>.</i> l'm on the job<i>.</i>

We got you, sir<i>.</i>

You're going to be all right, sir<i>.</i>

Why did you drive onto that bridge
and start World War lll?

-l saved his life, Frank<i>.</i>
-You were lucky, Orin<i>.</i>

Extremely lucky<i>.</i>

The Secret Service gave a direct order
not to storm that bridge!

They were responsible for him<i>.</i> Not you!

-What if it went the other way?
-l didn't vote for him<i>.</i>

This is funny to you?

-What's funny to me is--
-Cut it out<i>.</i>

Who were they?

Some Michigan militant group<i>.</i>

-Live by the sword, man<i>.</i>
-Sit down<i>.</i>

Look, Orin<i>.</i>
We've known each other a long time<i>.</i>

l am your friend, but also your boss<i>.</i>

As your friend, you don't follow orders<i>.</i>
You're unmanageable<i>.</i>

You don't obey the law
or think before you act<i>.</i>

And now, as your boss, you're fired<i>.</i>

-Just like that<i>.</i>
-Hinges wants you out<i>.</i>

There's nothing l can do<i>.</i>

You want to talk to him yourself,
be my guest<i>.</i>

<i>Now handle it!</i>

You are like a cockroach, Mr<i>.</i> Boyd<i>.</i>

Every time l try to get rid of you,
you appeal to the union<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and they send your ass right back here<i>.</i>

But not this time<i>.</i>

l've been talking to the Secret Service
figuring out what to do with you<i>.</i>

They want you to suffer, Mr<i>.</i> Boyd<i>.</i>

They want you to suffer bad
for that stupid stunt you pulled<i>.</i>

And l must say, l do not disagree<i>.</i>

You guys are unbelievable<i>.</i>

l saw a problem, l fixed it<i>.</i> Simple as that<i>.</i>

That's bullshit, Mr<i>.</i> Boyd<i>.</i>

Because of cops like you<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>police have a bad image everywhere<i>.</i>

You won't pin that on me<i>.</i>
l stick my neck out every day<i>.</i>

You remind me of bureaucrats in the '60s
sending kids to fight in Vietnam<i>.</i>

l'm not going to send you to Vietnam<i>.</i>

-l'm going to send you to the 15th<i>.</i>
-That shithole<i>.</i>

You'll fit right in<i>.</i>

Come on, get up<i>.</i>

l know my rights, man<i>.</i>

Knock off the shit!

Understand?

Can l help you?

l'm looking for the ringleader of this circus<i>.</i>

Yes, sir<i>.</i> And you are?

-Boyd<i>.</i> The commander's expecting me<i>.</i>
-Follow me<i>.</i>

Commander's got a grip on things<i>.</i>

l've seen mental wards
saner than this place<i>.</i>

Can we start over?

Too late for first impressions<i>.</i> Sit<i>.</i>

This year alone, three complaints
filed against you for excessive force<i>.</i>

This doesn't seem like a hero's welcome<i>.</i>

You want to be welcomed?
Stay out of the headlines<i>.</i>

Around here,
there's no such thing as heroes<i>.</i>

l've got community activists swearing
we treat everybody like criminals<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and criminals all swearing
they're altar boys<i>.</i>

Maybe l was never an altar boy,
but the point is--

The point is,
cops don't uphold the law by breaking it<i>.</i>

Now, you got a problem in my house,
you come see me<i>.</i>

None of this Lone Ranger stuff
that l keep hearing about<i>.</i>

Are you listening?

lf l have a problem,
l'll come and see the commander<i>.</i>

All that stuff with the Vice President?
A little water never hurt anybody<i>.</i>

But l am worried
about your discipline problem<i>.</i>

l was thinking about putting you on a desk<i>.</i>

-l can't type<i>.</i>
-l have a better idea<i>.</i>

Something that will broaden your horizons<i>.</i>

And then her dog<i>.</i>

Her dog gets so freaked out<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>he takes this enormous shit<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>right in the middle of the living room<i>.</i>

l chased that little bastard everywhere<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>until l finally cornered him<i>.</i>

l warned her not to buy a frigging poodle<i>.</i>

l never could have thrown
a German Shepherd out the window<i>.</i>

Okay<i>.</i>

That's it<i>.</i> Let it out<i>.</i>

Okay? That's why we're here<i>.</i>

To talk through our problems,
not to let it bottle up<i>.</i>

Okay<i>.</i>

And the rest of you,
l want you to dig down deep<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and ask yourself the question:

Why are we mad and what are we mad at?

Good<i>.</i> Okay<i>.</i>

Who'd like to go next?

Hey, everyone<i>.</i>

How are you?

For those of you just tuning in, my name
is Henry Wayne, and l'm a rageaholic<i>.</i>

You probably all recognize me
from my show, <i>Detroit A.M.</i>

You're probably wondering
what happened to my head here<i>.</i>

l know it's always something,
and l shouldn't lose my cool<i>.</i>

l was at Krispy Kreme,
picking up a twelve-pack<i>.</i>

-And this guy--
-Okay<i>.</i>

l'm so sorry to interrupt you but<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>l'm kind of looking for a fresh face next<i>.</i>

l've been sitting there<i>....</i>

We'll get back to you<i>.</i>

l'm a ticking time bomb,
and l'm ready to implode<i>.</i>

Let's solve my problem<i>.</i>

Sit down!

Okay<i>.</i>

So, who's it going to be?

Mr<i>.</i> Boyd?
l believe that you were sent to us<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>because of work-related stress<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>aggression towards authority figures<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and an all-around lack of discipline<i>.</i>

l'm fine<i>.</i> You can move on<i>.</i>
Other people want to say something<i>.</i>

Mr<i>.</i> Boyd, denial is a classic symptom
of unhealthy rage<i>.</i>

Okay? So why don't you just stand up<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and tell us a little bit about yourself<i>.</i>

l'd like to make this clear:
l don't have rage<i>.</i>

l'm a happy guy<i>.</i> You see this face?

This is a happy face<i>.</i> You all<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>would be lucky to be as happy as l am<i>.</i>

What am l, a shit magnet?

Junior, having a tough time?

You got to get in and out quick<i>.</i>
l'm an expert at this<i>.</i>

l could do that in a blink of an eye<i>.</i>

-Why don't you show us?
-Watch<i>.</i>

-Just like that<i>.</i> See?
-You a magician?

You want me to show you
how to pull a rabbit out of your ass?

Screw Linda<i>.</i> Come on back in<i>.</i>

Everybody's tearing
the tops off their desks<i>.</i>

Who the hell are you?

Henry Wayne<i>. Detroit A.M.</i>

-This a friend of yours?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

-Go back to class<i>.</i>
-They're gonna kill me without you<i>.</i>

lf you stay here, they might kill you, too,
so go back to class<i>.</i>

Jeez! Well, no! Well, shit!

l don't even know this guy<i>.</i>

Stay out of our class<i>.</i>
We got people in there with real problems<i>.</i>

FYl, next week
l'm doing a show on violent twins<i>.</i>

-Enough of this bullshit!
-You're not twins?

Take the man's keys<i>.</i>

Give me your keys<i>.</i>

Stop it! Mr<i>.</i> Boyd, stop hitting that man!

Mr<i>.</i> Boyd! What're you doing?
This is no way to deal with your anger<i>.</i>

Screw that, man! You kill
those bastards! They tried to pop us!

Did you guys see that?
Can you believe this shit?

Boyd is such a bad-ass<i>.</i> He could easily
win a tough-men competition<i>.</i>

You guys just missed it,
but l'm glad l got here when l did<i>.</i>

Boyd's a cop! He's a cop!
He gets to do this shit all the time!

We're going to have
great stories for group!

You see how happy l make others?

Hey, Boyd<i>.</i>

Good job, man<i>.</i>

We'll see you next week?

Nobody's forgotten about you<i>.</i>

You're not allowed to play any music here<i>.</i>

Could you turn the music off, please?

Turn the music off, please, brother<i>.</i>

Look, can you turn the music off, please!

Can you not hear me?
Could you turn the music down, please?

Yeah! Hit it!

lt is not a toy<i>.</i>

Mrs<i>.</i> Johnson was shaking her ass<i>.</i>

Mrs<i>.</i> Johnson!
Shake your ass, baby<i>.</i> Shake it!

Mrs<i>.</i> Johnson<i>.</i>

You think l could hit some corners in this?

Take it on a test drive<i>.</i>

How about hooking a brother up then?

Hooking a brother up<i>.</i>

The cheapest car we have here is $75,000<i>.</i>

Actually, there are only seven of these

Hey, you!

Turn off the engine!

-Would you turn off the engine, please?
-Yeah, yeah!

Could you turn off

You don't have to yell<i>.</i>

All you had to do was ask<i>.</i>
You'd get much better results<i>.</i>

-Will you please just leave?
-No<i>.</i>

l want this<i>.</i>

Unless you decide you'd like to live in this,
l suggest that you--

l suggest you get started
on the paperwork<i>.</i>

What do these people think?

Oh, my God<i>.</i>

There's $300,000 in there<i>.</i>

Make sure he gets the commission<i>.</i>

Maybe l made a mistake<i>.</i>

You know?

We're both homies<i>.</i>
All of us here<i>.</i> Why don't you<i>....</i>

Homies! l'm your man!

Faster, dog! Yeah! Faster!

Okay, dog, go right<i>.</i>

Sit down, man<i>.</i>
Can't afford to get pulled over<i>.</i>

We got a big night tonight<i>.</i>

Doesn't anybody sleep anymore?

Yeah<i>.</i> Bring you the goods, baby<i>.</i>

Hey!

-What are you looking at?
-Oh, shit, man!

You always walk up on somebody
like that? Could've given me a coronary<i>.</i>

You mind if l take a look?

-Bird watching?
-No, man<i>.</i>

Just checking on my old lady<i>.</i>
Keeping tabs on her<i>.</i>

Women<i>.</i> You can't trust them<i>.</i>

Not as far as l can throw her ass<i>.</i>
And she a big bitch<i>.</i>

l don't see anything<i>.</i> Where is she?

Up in the corner over there, man<i>.</i>

No luck<i>.</i>

l think maybe you should
go home and call her tomorrow<i>.</i>

Cool<i>.</i> Just give me my shit, bro<i>.</i>

l'm sorry<i>.</i>

Sure enough! Five-O<i>.</i>

Five-O<i>.</i>

Come on, man<i>.</i>

Shit! Come on, man<i>.</i> Quit treating me

Man, this shit hurts!

Now get out of here<i>.</i>

Hey, no, don't go! Don't leave!

He's going to try to put a plunger
in my ass! What you doing, man?

Don't go anywhere<i>.</i>

Let's see if you have this shit
when you get back out here!

Satisfied?

How much?

How about 25?
With a cut here, a cut there<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>it'll double your money easily<i>.</i>
Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make<i>.</i>

l need major weight<i>.</i> l need it yesterday<i>.</i>

l really don't want to see any more of this<i>.</i>

-Give me a ballpark figure<i>.</i>
-Anywhere in the seven figures<i>.</i>

<i>Yo, it's Five</i>-<i>O! lt's a setup! Get out!</i>

Well, l guess the grill was optional<i>.</i>

You have the right
to remain silent, asshole<i>.</i>

Take a look in my back pocket, cop<i>.</i>

You think you can buy your way
out of this?

You just ruined three months
of undercover work<i>.</i>

Think of the promotion you're gonna get<i>.</i>

Come on, let's go<i>.</i> Move<i>.</i>

-What are you doing?
-l'm already in the intersection!

Next time you see a cop blow a whistle,
pay attention<i>.</i>

Blow this<i>.</i>

What, are you blind?

Come on!

Where's a cop when you need one?

Fresh meat!

Montini<i>.</i>

Do me at 30<i>.</i>

Go!

Oh, yeah!

Hey, you, Boyd<i>.</i>

No, thanks<i>.</i>

Hey, Serpico<i>.</i>

Afraid of a little pain?

No, l'm just trying to quit<i>.</i>

Maybe you're just hiding
a wire under your shirt<i>.</i>

-Think l'm a plant after the other night?
-Maybe that was your cover<i>.</i>

Who knows? l<i>.</i>A<i>.</i>'s tried everything else
to slip a mole in here<i>.</i>

Go for it<i>.</i>

Go easy on the first time<i>.</i>

Give him twenty-five<i>.</i>

Twenty-five, my ass!

The bad guys are out there<i>.</i> Not in here<i>.</i>

Give me my money!

See you making friends fast<i>.</i>

Just take some deep breaths, in and out<i>.</i>
How do you feel?

Electrified<i>.</i>

Yeah, you'll be all right<i>.</i>
lt's just a hazing thing<i>.</i>

Everybody goes through it<i>.</i>
Welcome to the one-five<i>.</i>

-Orin Boyd?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

-You're from the two-one, right?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

They said you're coming<i>.</i> l'm George Clark<i>.</i>

Nice to meet you, George<i>.</i>

l mean, you know,
you're like a legend, man<i>.</i>

l used to read about you
in some new caper every week<i>.</i>

-Don't believe everything you read<i>.</i>
-l don't<i>.</i>

But there was one l was curious about<i>.</i>

You really beat a suspect
unconscious with a dead cat?

No<i>.</i>

Cat wasn't dead<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i> That's funny<i>.</i>

Cop who came in to break it up,
who was that?

Strutt<i>.</i> Sergeant Lewis Strutt<i>.</i>

He's a good man, a fair man<i>.</i>

Listen, don't worry about Montini<i>.</i>
Shit happens<i>.</i>

Who was Montini trying to set up?

That would be Latrell Walker<i>.</i>

Why you ask? You going after him?

Hey, how you doing?

What do you need?

l need to see the log book
for the last couple of nights<i>.</i>

-Here<i>.</i>
-Thanks<i>.</i>

Who or what are you looking for?

Just some shit bird
who thinks he got away clean<i>.</i>

Can you run a check for it?
All l have is a name, Latrell<i>.</i> Black male<i>.</i>

This isn't the Hall of Records<i>.</i>
Check records downtown<i>.</i>

Thanks a lot<i>.</i>

Happy to help you<i>.</i>

l'm the janitor<i>.</i>
My daughter, Maria, is in the office<i>.</i>

Stay down<i>.</i>

l'm one of the good guys<i>.</i> Come here<i>.</i>

Freeze! Don't move!

l'm a cop<i>.</i>

Bruce, get it out of the way<i>.</i>

Can l get you guys in this area over here?

Keep it back<i>.</i>
Sorry, people, you'll have to stand back<i>.</i>

Officer Boyd<i>.</i>

What have you got?

Take a look at this<i>.</i>

This was taken a few minutes ago
at the police evidence locker<i>.</i>

They keep large quantities of narcotics
here at Piper Tech's main vault<i>.</i>

Yeah, there were six guys<i>.</i> They wore
masks, and their voices were altered<i>.</i>

How much did they take?

About 50 kilos of heroin<i>.</i>

Wait<i>.</i> Can you rewind that bit?

-Freeze on that guy<i>.</i>
-You got it<i>.</i>

Now, can you zoom in right there?

What do you think this is?
<i>Monday Night Football?.</i>

Best l can do is 50 percent<i>.</i>

What do you think?

-Rolex?
-lt's a TAG<i>.</i>

Height, l'd say about 5'10'<i>'</i>?

l'd say so<i>.</i>

And he's black<i>.</i>

Hey, guys<i>.</i>

Hey, look who's here<i>.</i>

-Hey, Montini<i>.</i>
-What's up?

Just giving Officer Boyd here a preview
of the playback from security<i>.</i>

Boyd<i>.</i> What are you doing here?
Whose case did you screw up this time?

You guys mind giving us
a moment to ourselves?

We have some catching up to do<i>.</i>

l'm just fucking with you<i>.</i>
No hard feelings about the other night<i>.</i>

Straight up,
l would have done the same thing<i>.</i>

-So what happened here?
-Property vault was hit<i>.</i>

Fifty kilos of heroin stolen<i>.</i>

Shit, someone's having a big party tonight<i>.</i>

-What, professional hit?
-l don't think pros would be so sloppy<i>.</i>

Probably right<i>.</i> l'm going to head up<i>.</i>
You get wind of anything, let me know<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i>

What the hell were you doing
at Piper Tech?

Last time l checked,
this was the men's locker room<i>.</i>

Answer the question, Boyd<i>.</i>

l was driving by and l heard the call<i>.</i>

l told you,
l don't tolerate lone wolf behavior<i>.</i>

You got a problem, you come to me<i>.</i>

lt's my only problem<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i> l'll tell you what<i>.</i> You're back<i>.</i>

But you're walking the beat<i>.</i> And l'm not
letting you out without a leash<i>.</i>

Hey, George<i>.</i>

Stop robbing the vending machine<i>.</i>
Come over here<i>.</i>

And l want to know every move
you make out there<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>or l will have you typing out
reports till your retirement<i>.</i>

That damn machine ate my quarters again<i>.</i>

-Fifth time<i>.</i>
-Whatever<i>.</i>

George, meet your new partner here<i>.</i>

New partner? You mean the two of us?

You make a nice couple<i>.</i>

lt's me, George<i>.</i>

-Okay?
-What are you doing here?

Making a mistake picking you up for work<i>.</i>

Nice place you got here<i>.</i>

<i>Good morning, everyone,</i>
<i>and welcome to</i> Detroit A<i>.</i>M<i>.</i>

<i>l'm your host...</i>

-<i>...Henry Wayne.</i>
-l love this guy<i>.</i>

<i>Today, we'll face your worst fears.</i>

-<i>What really ticks you off?.</i>
-Henry!

<i>When l'm on the freeway, stuck behind</i>
<i>some idiot going</i> 55 <i>in the fast lane.</i>

-He gets a little carried away<i>.</i>
-<i>What did l do?</i>

<i>Did l casually flip him the bird?</i>

<i>Or did l fantasize</i>
<i>about running them off the road...</i>

<i>...and cutting their freaking head off?.</i>

So we got a twelve-block stretch<i>.</i>

l like to cruise once or twice,
let the people know we're out here<i>.</i>

Then we can walk it on foot<i>.</i>

l grew up in this area, man<i>.</i>
Now look at it<i>.</i>

Thugs turned it into shit<i>.</i>

Slowly getting a handle on it though<i>.</i>

Might turn this place around after all<i>.</i>

-You married, George?
-Five years next month<i>.</i>

Beautiful woman<i>.</i>
Stuck by me through a lot of shit<i>.</i>

Got a 14-month-old boy<i>.</i>

What about you?

Same old cliche<i>.</i> l guess she got tired
of all those sleepless nights<i>.</i>

Tell me about Montini<i>.</i>

He's a bully<i>.</i> Been in four shootings<i>.</i>

He's still standing<i>.</i> Figure that out<i>.</i>

Hangs out with that mountain man,
Useldinger<i>.</i>

What's the story with him?

Strong as an ox<i>.</i> Got the l<i>.</i>Q<i>.</i> of a handball<i>.</i>

He was a police officer down south,
spent a year undercover in the KKK<i>.</i>

Wound up taking down a cell
all by himself<i>.</i> That guy's an animal<i>.</i>

Good thing Strutt came in<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>because he knows
we're all on the same team<i>.</i>

-What's the story with Strutt?
-He knows everyone<i>.</i>

Need some extra cash,
he can get you a security gig<i>.</i>

Tickets to the Red Wings,
he can make it happen<i>.</i>

Anything you want<i>.</i> He's the ultimate
concierge<i>.</i> A tough bastard, too<i>.</i>

Sometimes, on duty,
he doesn't wear his gun<i>.</i>

Once pulled a rabid Doberman off this boy
and killed it with his bare hands<i>.</i>

So, you got a thing for Mulcahy, or what?

-l saw the way she was eyeing you<i>.</i>
-How long has she been your commander?

About a year now<i>.</i>
And she did a stint over at l<i>.</i>A<i>.</i>

Cleaned up a lot of precincts, too<i>.</i>

Left l<i>.</i>A<i>.</i> to come over to the 15th<i>.</i>

What do you see?

That yellow Hummer<i>.</i>

l know<i>.</i>

l'm barely making ends meet
and that's that fool's fifth car<i>.</i>

-Who?
-His name's T<i>.</i>K<i>.</i>

He owns a club called The Static<i>.</i>

Hey!

l need to see a little bit more green
than that, baby<i>.</i> Come on, put it on<i>.</i>

l like color<i>.</i>

Yeah<i>.</i> Put it on<i>.</i>

That's it<i>.</i> Squeeze it on<i>.</i>

There you go<i>.</i> Hey, baby<i>.</i>

Put them on the glass<i>.</i>

Them some titties<i>.</i>

Everything cool? All right<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i> See you upstairs<i>.</i>

Yo, what's up, dog<i>.</i> All right, man<i>.</i>

He's here<i>.</i> Bring the truck around back<i>.</i>

-Why you looking for him?
-Because l want my grill back<i>.</i>

Yeah, tell them keep shaking that ass!

Look at Rockefeller here<i>.</i> What is it?

Too rich to count the money
the old-fashioned way?

Close the door, man<i>.</i>

Sitting behind my desk in my office
at my club<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and you want me to close my door?

You paid for it<i>.</i>

-Look like you need a drink<i>.</i>
-Yeah!

You think this deal won't go through?

T, come on, man<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i>

l'll get that drink for you<i>.</i>

Boss<i>.</i>

T, come here for a minute<i>.</i>

What's up, dog?

Where would l be without you, dog?

All by your motherfucking self<i>.</i>

You right<i>.</i>

Now, get my drink, bitch!

Nigger, l got your bitch<i>.</i>

We have an open mike tonight<i>.</i> Come
downstairs and tell some of them jokes<i>.</i>

l said, l want to see asses shaking! Damn!

Baby, can l have a Hennessy Paradis?

Sure, T<i>.</i> We still on for tonight?

Sorry<i>.</i> l can't make that tonight<i>.</i>

But l promise<i>.</i> l'll make it up to you<i>.</i>

Why'd you even make plans with me?

l just need a couple more days
to work some shit out<i>.</i>

After that, l'm yours<i>.</i>

Shit<i>.</i> By the end of the night,
you just might<i>....</i>

Fuck me!

Dang! Now you talking<i>.</i>

Shit!

What's up, man? What's up?

What's the matter?
You couldn't get in the VlP room?

Have a drink, motherfucker<i>.</i>

Say hello to my sumo Negro<i>.</i>

He about to turn your ass into sashimi<i>.</i>

You in trouble now, sucker<i>.</i>

You aren't doing shit<i>.</i> Get his ass!

There you go, Joe! Kick his ass<i>.</i>

Shit<i>.</i>

Get out of my way! Move!

Freeze! Police!

Put the briefcase down<i>.</i>

Hands in the air<i>.</i>

Up against the wall<i>.</i>

Keep them against the wall<i>.</i>

Got anything in your pocket?

What's this? Don't move<i>.</i>

Got a permit for this?

Come on! Grab the gun! Let's roll!

Oh, shit!

Shit! l'm fucking up my Versace shit!

Come on, dog<i>.</i> Pull me through<i>.</i> Shit!

What are we doing, Boyd?

What are we fucking doing, man?

Either we call backup, or get out of here<i>.</i>

What backup? We ain't here<i>.</i>

Would you answer my question?
l almost fucking died tonight<i>.</i>

Sit down before you fall down<i>.</i>

How are you doing? Come sit down<i>.</i>

-And you are?
-Officer Boyd<i>.</i> l've a few questions for you<i>.</i>

Before you even get into all that<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>you shouldn't be asking me<i>.</i>
l don't know nothing<i>.</i>

Let's start with something simple,
like who is Latrell Walker?

Never heard of him<i>.</i>

Says in here he visited you
a number of times<i>.</i>

ls he a friend of yours?

Said l'd never heard of him<i>.</i>

Are you deaf or something?

No, l'm persistent<i>.</i>
l ran a check on this guy<i>.</i>

Came up empty<i>.</i>
Guy's clean, like a little too clean<i>.</i>

No warrants, no accidents,
no parking tickets<i>.</i>

lt's like the guy was born yesterday,
and that makes me nervous<i>.</i>

Your point is?

l want to know
what your relationship is with him<i>.</i>

Did he take over your business
when you went away?

l don't know what you talking about<i>.</i>

ls it meth? ls it coke? What is it?

lt was heroin<i>.</i> Thought you knew that<i>.</i>

l know it say it right there<i>.</i> Come on, man<i>.</i>

The cops swear
you all know everything, man<i>.</i>

Know what, man?

You didn't learn nothing in juvie, did you?

Supposed to teach you not to piss
your life away<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>but you keep running back<i>.</i>

That's real clever<i>.</i> You know?

You ain't got a clue what's going on<i>.</i>

Your eyes is glued the fuck shut<i>.</i>

Pig<i>.</i>

You wanna do 10 years in here?
That's your business<i>.</i>

lf l were you,
l'd be grabbing for every lifeline tossed out<i>.</i>

Know what l'm saying?

You can't help me, man<i>.</i>

Can't help me at all<i>.</i>

You cannot put Tiger Woods
in the same league as Michael Jordan<i>.</i>

You don't have to be in shape to play golf<i>.</i>

You walk everywhere for Christ's sakes<i>.</i>

But Woods bench presses
damn near 300 pounds<i>.</i>

Well, unless he bench presses my dick<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>l'm really not impressed,
to tell you the truth<i>.</i>

-l'd say Wayne Gretzky's the best<i>.</i>
-You freaking Canadians<i>.</i>

You worship the guy<i>.</i>
You'd crucify the mother, ay?

Whatever, Dinger<i>.</i>

l got one<i>.</i> Babe Ruth<i>.</i>

-Baseball?
-Who?

Fall asleep during the action<i>.</i>

Don't knock baseball<i>.</i> That's un-American<i>.</i>

Wake me up when it's over<i>.</i>

Come on, guys<i>.</i> Come on<i>.</i>

The greatest athlete without a doubt
was Muhammad Ali<i>.</i>

He could defeat you with his mind<i>.</i>

He would never have to put a finger
on you, and have you psyched out<i>.</i>

-To The Greatest<i>.</i>
-To The Greatest<i>.</i>

Hey<i>.</i>

How's your head?

Head is fine<i>.</i>
lt's my pride that's still hurting<i>.</i>

Question for you<i>.</i>

Six months ago, there was a bust<i>.</i>
A kid named Shaun Rollins<i>.</i> Remember?

-Yeah, vaguely<i>.</i> Why?
-Anything suspicious about that arrest?

Far as l can remember, it was clean<i>.</i>

Montini always pays attention to detail
when he types those things up<i>.</i>

-Montini was the arresting officer?
-Yeah<i>.</i> Why?

Where could l find him?
To put two and two together<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>even things up<i>.</i>

Relax<i>.</i>

-What the fuck you doing?
-Shut up<i>.</i> Hands down<i>.</i>

-What are you doing?
-Why you pressing me?

-Who's pressing you?
-You got a cop on my ass<i>.</i>

Same guy from the other night<i>.</i>

He's a Neanderthal<i>.</i> He keeps popping up
all over the place<i>.</i>

He's not one of ours<i>.</i>

l'll take care of him<i>.</i> But what
were you thinking, showing up here?

l should just shoot you in case--

Look, if l wanted to bust you, man<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>l'd have brought you in a long time ago<i>.</i>
This is business<i>.</i>

l just got a shitload of product
for our next deal<i>.</i>

-Forget it<i>.</i>
-How much?

Around $5 million<i>.</i>

Yeah, right<i>.</i>

You wanted seven figures,
that's what l brought, right?

lf not, then we do have a big problem<i>.</i>

$5 million? lt'll get me locked up
until l'm eligible for social security<i>.</i>

l don't need social security, asshole<i>.</i>
l need police security<i>.</i>

So before we do any more business<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>you let me know
you got shit under control<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i>

Would it ease your worries
if l showed you our operation?

Fucking right<i>.</i>

Fine<i>.</i>

We'll call you when we're ready<i>.</i>
You just have the money together<i>.</i>

Done<i>.</i>

Really, Henry<i>.</i>
Right after group and everything<i>.</i>

Boyd? Shit!

l just came in to use the phone<i>.</i>

Relax, man<i>.</i> l just need a favor<i>.</i>

Ladies, would you let me talk
to my friend for a minute?

Anything<i>.</i> You need me to go undercover?
l'm like a chameleon<i>.</i>

lt also looks like you're kicking
a lot of big ass there<i>.</i> How many guys?

Two, but they were huge<i>.</i>
They were meat packers<i>.</i>

l could've used some of your moves<i>.</i>
Maybe you could teach me<i>.</i>

Later<i>.</i> You know that expose you did
on the Mob a few years ago?

How'd you get that intel?

l can be resourceful<i>.</i> Plus, l work
with the l Team, a group of former Pl's<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>who owe us their licenses
due to various felony convictions<i>.</i>

l need you to find out whatever you can
about a guy called Latrell Walker<i>.</i>

His identity seems to be a total scam<i>.</i>

And also what his connection is
with a guy called Shaun Rollins<i>.</i> Can you?

l'll see what l can dig up<i>.</i>
Why'd you come to me?

l don't want to attract any attention<i>.</i>

And l think your peculiar methods
might work for me<i>.</i>

-What's this all about?
-lt might be nothing<i>.</i>

lt might be something<i>.</i>
lf it's big, it's really big<i>.</i>

l just got to see
how high up this shit goes<i>.</i>

Don't screw this one up<i>.</i>

l won't,
because l've seen you when you're angry<i>.</i>

All right, ladies?

Come to papa<i>.</i>

-You want in on this?
-No<i>.</i>

l just want to make a toast<i>.</i>

This is to us
finally getting together for dinner<i>.</i>

But l just have one request<i>.</i>

l'm listening<i>.</i>

No police talk<i>.</i>

No mentioning the latest homicide
or gang shooting<i>.</i>

Tonight, just happy thoughts<i>.</i> Agreed?

Agreed<i>.</i> To happy thoughts<i>.</i>

Good evening, Commander<i>.</i>

What're you doing here, Boyd?

-You wanted to see me<i>.</i>
-ln my office, not here<i>.</i>

But l'm here now<i>.</i> So let's talk<i>.</i>

l'm sorry,
but we were actually right in the middle<i>.</i>

Why don't you take a walk?

lt's okay<i>.</i> Just give us five minutes<i>.</i>

l had to go to the men's room anyway<i>.</i>

-How'd you find me?
-What are you doing with this guy?

That is none of your business<i>.</i>

-He doesn't look right for you<i>.</i>
-And you do?

What did you want to talk to me about?

Why'd you visit Shaun Rollins?

-The walls have ears<i>.</i>
-l know everything, Boyd<i>.</i>

So, why am l here?

l don't have time for games<i>.</i>
What are you up to?

-You used to work for lnternal Affairs<i>.</i>
-Yeah<i>.</i>

Out of all the people around you,
how'd you know who you could trust?

Why? What have you got?

l can't say yet<i>.</i> Not till l have more proof<i>.</i>
What have you got?

Let's just say my instincts tell me
something's not quite right<i>.</i>

Bring me something solid<i>.</i>

l have something solid<i>.</i>

More solid<i>.</i>

-Then l'll know what to do with it<i>.</i>
-You'll know what to do with it?

-Carmine?
-Good<i>.</i>

Not bad<i>.</i> l'll see you on campus<i>.</i>

Watch your back<i>.</i>

Hey, Clark<i>.</i> What's going on?

Six<i>.</i> Nothing much<i>.</i>

l hear you're working with Supercop now<i>.</i>

What's that like?

Hey, George<i>.</i>
Which one are you? Starsky or Hutch?

Don't mind him<i>.</i>

l don't<i>.</i>

Heard about that scuffle<i>.</i>

What were you doing
at The Static anyway?

Orin wanted to question the owner, T<i>.</i>K<i>.</i>

About what?

They never spoke<i>.</i>

Boyd's trying to steal my bust, George<i>.</i>

He's a glory hound<i>.</i>
We've seen this kind before<i>.</i>

What else did you find out?

Nothing<i>.</i> We searched his office,
came up empty<i>.</i>

l wish you would have called
the point detective<i>.</i>

l would've found something<i>.</i>

We did find a visitor's pass from County<i>.</i>
Don't worry, Montini<i>.</i>

We'll let you know what we come up with<i>.</i>

You guys done with the bench?

Yeah, go ahead<i>.</i>

Hey, you know, Montini?

lf all you come down here
to do is work out your mouth<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>maybe you should move on<i>.</i>
Breaks our concentration<i>.</i>

Find out who they visited up at County<i>.</i>

Yeah, don't worry about that, l'm on it<i>.</i>

You come with me<i>.</i>

Be back in an hour<i>.</i>

Ready to meet the wizard?

Put it on<i>.</i>

You don't need to know where we're going<i>.</i>

<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

l always wanted to do that<i>.</i>

l wish l had a cat<i>.</i>

Heard a lot about you<i>.</i>

Wish l could say the same<i>.</i>

Like the saying goes:

'<i>'</i>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convince the world he didn't exist<i>.</i>'<i>'</i>

Let me show you around<i>.</i>

l don't get it<i>.</i> T-shirts?

Amazing what you can do
with the right chemicals<i>.</i>

Your connections are all over the country,
this is our plan<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>to get the heroin out of state<i>.</i>

No risky exposure, no trail back to us<i>.</i>

These T-shirts are dipped
in a heroin solution<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>and dried under these lamps<i>.</i>

They're folded and sealed in shrink-wrap<i>.</i>

Dogs can't even smell it<i>.</i>

You can send them anywhere you want<i>.</i>

Extract the heroin later<i>.</i>

You in?

Yeah, l'm in<i>.</i>

Pick you up at midnight<i>.</i>

Me and the l Team came up
with some fascinating intel<i>.</i>

Latrell Walker's whole l<i>.</i>D<i>.</i>'s fake<i>.</i>
He's a shell<i>.</i>

He paid a lot too<i>.</i> He's got everything<i>.</i>

Driver's license, birth certificate,
credit cards<i>.</i>

He's even got a voter's registration card<i>.</i>

Normal investigation
wouldn't have uncovered this<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>but one of our dudes worked for the lRS,
and can computer-dissect anybody<i>.</i>

Who is he, then?

He's Shaun Rollins' brother<i>.</i>

Listen to this<i>.</i>

<i>About six months ago,</i>
<i>Latrell's little brother, Shaun, gets popped.</i>

<i>He claims the heroin was planted,</i>
<i>but the cops made the charges stick.</i>

<i>Next thing you know,</i>
<i>Latrell's back in town.</i>

<i>That's why he was visiting him.</i>

<i>My sources ran a check on Shaun also,</i>
<i>and he's set for life financially.</i>

<i>How? From who?</i>

<i>He has a trust fund</i>
<i>set up in his name for millions...</i>

<i>...but he can't touch it until he's 2</i>5<i>.</i>

-<i>Who set it up for him?</i>
-<i>l'm getting to that.</i>

<i>Shaun also has another brother, Leon.</i>
<i>Or so l thought.</i>

<i>Now, Leon Rollins and Latrell Walker</i>
<i>are the same person.</i>

<i>You're shitting me.</i>

<i>Leon's also a gazillionaire.</i>

<i>How can a guy with no record</i>
<i>make so much money dealing heroin?</i>

<i>No, no. The guy's a computer wiz.</i>

<i>Started up a dot com out of</i> V<i>irginia</i>
<i>called</i> $9<i>.</i>99 <i>Dot</i> C<i>om.</i>

<i>''Anything you want under</i> $<i>10. ''</i>

<i>And he did great. Lucky bastard</i>
<i>cashed out just before the bubble burst.</i>

<i>Maybe Latrell's buying heroin,</i>
<i>and seeking distributors on the lnternet.</i>

Welcome to the Computer Age, my friend<i>.</i>

No street involvement,
no watching out for cops, no risk<i>.</i>

lt's brilliant, isn't it?

lt still doesn't add up
unless they have some big debts<i>.</i>

Well, here's all the paperwork<i>.</i>
l got lPO statements, tax returns<i>.</i>

l got his address
from a crooked car dealer we investigated<i>.</i>

l don't know if it will help, but l did my job<i>.</i>

You did good, man<i>.</i>

Thanks, partner<i>.</i>

Let's go<i>.</i> Smash it!

Let's move it!

Montini, Useldinger<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>what a surprise<i>.</i>

This to make me talk?

No, it's to make you die<i>.</i>

lt's from Latrell<i>.</i>
He made us an offer we couldn't refuse<i>.</i>

Look out!

Shoot him!

You don't have the balls to kill me yourself<i>.</i>

You don't know what you're talking about<i>.</i>

-l know everything about you<i>.</i>
-About time<i>.</i>

But why would l want you dead?

Because l'm that close to locking you up
with your brother<i>.</i>

You want to see what's really going on?

Come on<i>.</i>

lt's all right, it's all right<i>.</i> Chill<i>.</i>

This is my operation<i>.</i>

-What's up, man?
-Yeah, it's all right<i>.</i>

l believe you two have already met<i>.</i>

What the hell're you doing here?

You want another ass-whupping?

l'm joking<i>.</i> l got your grill downstairs<i>.</i>

l can send somebody to get it if you want<i>.</i>

Come, l want to show you something<i>.</i>

All right<i>.</i>

You<i>.</i>

Good memory<i>.</i>

This is Trish, my guardian angel<i>.</i>

-She's helping out with the project<i>.</i>
-What project?

See, a lot of people talk about
police corruption, but no one ever sees it<i>.</i>

l figured l'd be the one to show it to them,
over the lnternet<i>.</i>

Have a seat<i>.</i>

-<i>How much?</i>
-<i>How about 2</i>5<i>?</i>

<i>With a cut here, a cut there...</i>

<i>...it'll double your money easily.</i>
<i>Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make.</i>

<i>l need major weight. l need it yesterday.</i>

We've been tracking
their activity for months<i>.</i>

l'm compiling the video
on our digital editing system<i>.</i>

<i>You come with me.</i>

<i>Be back in an hour.</i>

When we have enough evidence,
we'll show it to the authorities<i>.</i>

lf that doesn't work,
we'll post the video on our website<i>.</i>

<i>Why you pressing me?</i>

<i>Look, ifl wanted to bust you, man,</i>
<i>l'd have brought you in a long time ago.</i>

<i>This is business. l just got a shitload</i>
<i>ofproduct for our next deal.</i>

lncriminating shit<i>.</i>

They think l'm a buyer from the
West Coast looking to score major weight<i>.</i>

They raised it, too<i>.</i>

l don't know how, but they managed
to get $5 million worth of shit<i>.</i>

Piper Tech<i>.</i>

Run number 8<i>.</i>

-You sure?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

<i>l always wanted to do that.</i>

You didn't know he was in on it?

<i>''The greatest trick the devil ever pulled</i>
<i>was convince the world he didn't exist. ''</i>

Where'd you guys get this stuff?<i>.</i>

From everywhere<i>.</i> Check it out<i>.</i>

This is our stuff<i>.</i>
We have cameras hidden in everything<i>.</i>

Watches, batteries, purses<i>.</i> You name it<i>.</i>

This is a little camera that can be hidden
everywhere and can see everything<i>.</i>

And you're the star of a few of these
as well<i>.</i>

C<i>ome on, let me go.</i>

<i>Shit, man!</i>

C<i>ome on!</i>

Lucky move<i>.</i>

Unlucky face<i>.</i>

T, get us something to drink<i>.</i>

Just because l own a bar don't mean
l'm lsaac from <i>The Love Boat.</i>

A Hennessy Paradis, please<i>.</i>

Yes, master<i>.</i>
Should l get some for Mr<i>.</i> Charlie, too?

What do you think?

l think we need to take them down now<i>.</i>

Not yet<i>.</i> l want to catch
all these guys at once<i>.</i> Stick it to them<i>.</i>

l won't wait<i>.</i> They tried to kill me<i>.</i>

l won't let you ruin this<i>.</i>
My brother's ass is on the line<i>.</i>

What's he got to do with it?

Your buddies wanted
their own drug dealer on the street<i>.</i>

Rather than lose him, they framed Shaun<i>.</i>
l got to get him out of jail<i>.</i>

l made my father a promise before he died<i>.</i>

That l'd always be my brother's keeper<i>.</i>

l keep my promises<i>.</i>

Where'd you promise to meet these boys?

Frederick's Cleaners<i>.</i>

After midnight<i>.</i>

l'll need a car<i>.</i>

Give him the keys<i>.</i>

T, the keys<i>.</i>

Come on, man<i>.</i>
My mama don't even drive my car<i>.</i>

Give him the keys<i>.</i>

You scratch it, you buy it<i>.</i>

Nice inconspicuous car you got there<i>.</i>

Thank you<i>.</i>

What'd you find out?

Piper Tech was hit by cops<i>.</i>

-Cops?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

Come on, Boyd<i>.</i>

Strutt, Useldinger, Montini,
they're all dirty<i>.</i>

Are you positive?
What proof do you have?

Start the car<i>.</i>

Get the car! Let's go!

-ls that proof enough?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

Now move<i>.</i>

Step on it<i>.</i> We got him<i>.</i>

Come on!

-There he is<i>.</i>
-Pop him now!

Shit!

Hold on!

-l always said women are bad drivers<i>.</i>
-l agree<i>.</i>

-There he is!
-Yeah<i>.</i>

Get up on them!

Shit!

Shit! Goddamn!

Get out of the way!

Get out of the way!

-Go right<i>.</i>
-Going left<i>.</i>

Get up to him!

Shoot him!

Damn!

Hey, my bike!

l got a date tonight!

Move!

Get out of the way!

Go around!

Oh, shit!

Push it through!

Fucker<i>.</i>

Look out!

Just get it off! Just get it off!

There!

Get the fuck off<i>....</i>

-This better be good<i>.</i>
-<i>Frank, l'm in hell.</i>

What happened?
There's an APB out on you<i>.</i>

Mulcahy's dead, you fled the scene<i>.</i>
They're pinning Piper Tech on you<i>.</i>

Strutt and Montini<i>.</i>
They're behind everything<i>.</i>

-<i>How do you know that?</i>
-Because they tried to kill me<i>.</i>

-Look--
-<i>Frank, you've known me for a long time.</i>

Have l ever lied to you?

What do you want me to do?

You said l never think before l act<i>.</i>

Well, l'm thinking now<i>.</i>

l need backup<i>.</i>

There's a deal to go down in an hour<i>.</i>

<i>Strutt's selling the heroin he stole</i>
<i>from Piper Tech.</i>

l'll get some men<i>.</i>

Strutt? What the hell
are you talking about?

l understand if you don't believe me<i>.</i> You
said you wanted to clean up the streets<i>.</i>

Here's your chance<i>.</i>

Give me the baby, honey<i>.</i>

You take over<i>.</i>

Let's do it<i>.</i>

Right on time<i>.</i>

Punctuality is the soul of good business<i>.</i>

l like that<i>.</i>

Check it out if you want<i>.</i>

Frank<i>.</i>

Christ, Orin<i>.</i>

Did you bring anybody?

l don't know who we can trust<i>.</i>

l want you to put this on<i>.</i>
You'll need all the protection you can get<i>.</i>

Let me hold that for you<i>.</i>

l haven't worn one of these in years<i>.</i>

Tastes like candy<i>.</i>

As you can see, we kept our end<i>.</i>

Now it's your turn<i>.</i>

ls that the money?

Half<i>.</i>

$2<i>.</i>5 million<i>.</i>

Deal wasn't for half<i>.</i>

l'm just covering my ass<i>.</i>

You'll get the rest as soon as
we leave in one piece<i>.</i>

You have my word<i>.</i>

Your word is not good enough<i>.</i>

Looks like we have a problem<i>.</i>

You'll get your money<i>.</i>

You got to be sensitive to my situation<i>.</i>

Half's better than nothing<i>.</i>

Hold up<i>.</i> Now, listen<i>.</i>
Nobody's trying to fuck anybody here<i>.</i>

l think you are, Leon<i>.</i>

-What?
-What was you thinking?

Where are you going with this?

l thought you was smarter than this<i>.</i>

So did l, Strutt<i>.</i>

Move<i>.</i>

lf it isn't Hou-motherfucking-dini<i>.</i>

Escaped so many traps,
should be wearing a cape<i>.</i>

l thought you said
you had this animal on a leash<i>.</i>

You assholes couldn't keep
your shit together<i>.</i>

l guess l picked the wrong precinct<i>.</i>

Look around you<i>.</i> You picked the right<i>.</i>

Then finish the job<i>.</i>

Nice friends you got, Boyd<i>.</i>

Don't give me that look<i>.</i>
l've been on the force too long<i>.</i>

Laying my life on the line, and for what?

A lousy $40,000 a year?

The hell with that!

You have single-handedly
screwed up my operation<i>.</i>

lt's our operation<i>.</i>

Let's get it straight<i>.</i> l run this show!

Not you! Not him! None of you!

Prove it<i>.</i>

Kill him<i>.</i>

Freeze!

Shit! l'm hit<i>.</i>

This is your big fucking plan?

Go<i>.</i>

l'll get Strutt<i>.</i> Take care of Montini<i>.</i>

l got that motherfucker<i>.</i>

Don't leave me here!

l got you covered<i>.</i>

You okay, chief?<i>.</i>

Hell, no!

Boyd, you okay?

-l don't know<i>.</i>
-l'll check your vest<i>.</i>

-Didn't go through<i>.</i>
-Good news<i>.</i>

Damn it!

Fuck!

Daniels!

Where you going?

You're fired!

This is Strutt, ready for pickup<i>.</i>

Go!

Shake him off!

You and your brother
can rot in jail together<i>.</i>

Motherfucker!

You all right?

You'll be cleaning up the street soon<i>.</i>

Then l'll be reading about you<i>.</i>

l don't know about that<i>.</i>

Tell them l'm your partner<i>.</i>
They won't let me through!

Yeah, let him in<i>.</i>

What happened here?
After all we been through?

We risk our lives, and l hear
about this on the strippers' scanner<i>.</i>

Shit!

Smack my mama on her ass!
That's Henry Wayne!

Can you do a story on me?

l was in there<i>.</i>
The cops shot me<i>.</i> l got shot 16 times<i>.</i>

Does that hurt?

Yeah! l'm not faking this shit!

-Could we film your surgery for the show?
-Yeah, you can film my stuff<i>.</i>

l'm going to be on TV<i>.</i>

-Can my mama come to the studio?
-You know it<i>.</i>

Cool<i>.</i> When you want to do it?
We're going to the hospital now<i>.</i>

-l'll meet you there<i>.</i>
-Okay<i>.</i>

-Mr<i>.</i> Boyd<i>.</i> Some good work in there<i>.</i>
-Thank you<i>.</i>

Faster you get rid of dirty cops,
the better for all of us<i>.</i>

Thanks for making a difference<i>.</i>

You want your old job back, at two-one<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>it's all yours<i>.</i>

No, l think l'll stay here<i>.</i> Right, pard?

Yeah<i>.</i>

-You know where to reach me<i>.</i>
-Yes, sir<i>.</i>

By the way, Mr<i>.</i> Boyd<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>l fought in Vietnam<i>.</i>

That don't surprise me<i>.</i>

-Your buddies are on there<i>.</i>
-Heard about your brother Shaun<i>.</i>

Hopefully, that'll get him out<i>.</i>

Think those tapes'll make a difference?

Courts don't give a shit about this<i>.</i>

So l had your brother pulled from County<i>.</i>

Just in case<i>.</i>

Thank you<i>.</i>

<i>He can hear me.</i>

-<i>Good.</i>
-<i>Daddy. Save some for me.</i>

<i>Save some for me.</i>
<i>Remember, puff, puff, pass.</i>

<i>Puff, puff, pass. He like to hold on</i>

-<i>How old is he?</i>
-<i>He's 4</i>8<i>.</i>

<i>ls Tawana backstage?</i>

-<i>My nipples are sensitive. Yours?</i>
-<i>Yeah. And huge.</i>

<i>l always tell women this:</i>

<i>''lf you want it to be over, lick my nipples. ''</i>

<i>l like my nipple to be nibbled on</i>
<i>and bit and pulled. l like a little pain.</i>

<i>l like it too.</i> V<i>ery little.</i>

<i>But they get out of control</i>
<i>and you don't say, ''That hurts. ''</i>

-<i>But they are.</i>
-<i>l sort oflike it.</i>

<i>Because l'm black,</i>
<i>you say l got to do a B and</i> E<i>?</i>

<i>No, no, but....</i>

<i>l pulled your record</i>
<i>before l came over here, too.</i>

<i>l know what you used to do.</i>

<i>And l still do.</i>

-<i>You been with a big woman?</i>
-<i>l have.</i>

<i>How was that?</i>

<i>lt was fine.</i>

<i>But l will say this, they're not jolly.</i>

-<i>They can be cranky.</i>
-<i>Feed them.</i>

-<i>Now, you like big women?</i>
-<i>l love big women.</i>

<i>lf you want to feel the heat,</i>
<i>you got to have the meat.</i>

<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

<i>A big woman good</i>
<i>in the summer and winter.</i>

<i>Good for shade in summer</i>
<i>and good for warmth in winter.</i>

<i>You're not masturbating enough.</i>

-<i>l masturbate two, three times a day.</i>
-<i>Do you?</i>

<i>l like to do it at the tanning salon.</i>

-C<i>ause, you are in there</i>--
-<i>At the tanning salon.</i>

<i>You probably aren't in there.</i>

<i>But you got to be careful,</i>
<i>because when you're doing it...</i>

<i>...you can't wear the goggles,</i>
<i>you got to watch the door.</i>

<i>So you can go blind masturbating actually,</i>
<i>like the old saying.</i>

E<i>very night, same routine. l get a towel...</i>

<i>...half damp. On one side, warm water.</i>
<i>Half dry on the other.</i>

<i>Astroglide. Lesbian porn.</i>

<i>Second only to nature.</i>

<i>No dicks allowed, number 6</i>7 <i>or 6</i>9<i>.</i>

<i>l don't get in trouble.</i>
C<i>lean up, everything's nice.</i>

<i>Although you can get that</i>
<i>on the remote control.</i>

<i>When you do a number two,</i>
<i>do you use a handy wipe?</i>

<i>l wipe, then l take a lot of toilet paper</i>
<i>and dip it in water....</i>

-<i>ln the bowl?</i>
-<i>ln a clean bowl.</i>

-<i>That's what l do.</i>
-<i>And then l wipe my ass.</i>

<i>We're too old to have shit stains</i>
<i>in our drawers.</i>

C<i>an't be cool</i>
<i>when you got a big</i>-<i>ass shit stain.</i>

<i>l've not peed the bed since l quit drinking.</i>

<i>l won a chugging contest before l quit.</i>

<i>And l not only peed the bed, l shit the bed.</i>

<i>l was in college. l woke and thought:</i>
<i>''What did my roommate do?''</i>

<i>And then l went:</i>
<i>''Wait a minute. What did l do?''</i>

<i>lf you have a real problem, get</i> V<i>iagra.</i>

<i>You don't need a problem for that.</i>
<i>You just go and get it.</i>

<i>They need to get that for women.</i>

<i>Well, they would call it Niagara then.</i>

-<i>You watch Oprah?</i>
-<i>Big or small Oprah?</i>

<i>l never liked small Oprah</i>
<i>because her head is too big.</i>

<i>Her head too big for that little body.</i>
<i>Then the eye started to droop.</i>

<i>Looked like</i> E<i>. T.</i>

-<i>Oprah, stay big.</i>
-<i>Oprah's great.</i>
