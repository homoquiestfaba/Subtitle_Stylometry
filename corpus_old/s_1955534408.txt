I-I want to be an actress,
but soon as I tell my parents

that they're just gonna
yank my ass back home.

Don't tell them and come to
the "Locked" audition with me.

<i>Previously on "Famous in Love..."</i>

This is Paige Townsend.

I can't believe I'm saying this

but did we just find our August?

You're into him, he's into you, too.

So do something about it.

We should talk about
this after your play.

Can we just pretend you're behind us?

The real story isn't about Rainer.

It's about Tangey Turner.

That slut who cheated on
my son with Jordan Wilder.

Paige, I wanted to call you personally.

You got the part.

Aren't you headed to
the studio this morning?

I am, but I need to
finish my spreadsheet

before my parents get here later.

Paige, it's not like you're telling them

you're becoming a sister-wife.

You landed the lead in a huge movie.

How mad can they get?
My dad's a teacher.

And education means everything to him.

If I drop out, I'll be the first person

in my family to not
get a college degree.

So... that mess of
numbers is your big plan?

Yes, my dad's mantra
is numbers don't lie.

So this is how I prove to him

that I can still be in
school and do the movie.

Oh, uh, I've got Bio,
but I'll be back later

to help you guys clean the apartment.

Thanks.
Well.

Get this place in shape

before your parents get here.

I thought Bio was on Tuesdays.

Did I say "Bio?" Slap
me awake. I meant Psych.

Well, good luck at your
scary producer meeting.

Love you.
Love you more.

Any idea why Nina wants to see you?

Well, I mean, it can't be to fire me.

I haven't even done anything yet.

Do you wanna have coffee after?

Actually, I got a call from
that agent who read my script.

No way!

And he wants to have a meeting.

Why didn't you tell us?
It's just a meeting.

I'm not letting you downplay this.

Just having somebody like
that read your script is...

... really...

awesome.

We should have that talk, you know.

The, the talk that we've been
talking about, talking about

but we still haven't actually
talked about it? That-that talk.

I think it's a little scary how I can

interpret your "Paige speak."

But, yeah, I do know.

We'll talk about it later, okay?

Good luck.
Good luck.

Well, I hate to think what would happen

if anyone ever found out about us.

We're two adults, there's nothing
wrong with what we're doing.

It's a little bit wrong.

But isn't that...

...part of the fun?

And I wonder what
Hollywood mega producer...

You sure you gotta go to work?

My insider tells me that Rainer Devon

and Jordan Wilder feud...

That little vulva promised me.

And the mystery slut is mega pop star

and Rainer's girlfriend, Tangey Turner.

What? No. How did he find out?

My secret source also revealed

that Jordan only had good intentions

when he checked in on
his best friend's girl.

But after he had too much to drink

Tangey turned on her sultry charm

and poor Jordan couldn't resist her.

That's not what happened.
Who told him that?

Tangey must've confided in someone.

You know we hooked up, but
it didn't go down like that.

We weren't even drinking.

Good morning! Hi, I'm Paige Townsen.

There's no D in the end.

Do you have a drive on, miss?
I should and, uh...

You can just call me Paige, uh...

Roberto.

Anyways, uh, I'm gonna be
coming in and out of here a lot

so, you know, we could
be on a first-name basis.

We're all on the same team, right?

Photo ID, please.

Oh. Uh, uh. Yeah, of course. Sure.

Where's my driver's license?

Oh, there you go.

That's a school ID card.

I'll need a valid driver's license.

Um, oh, come on, look at that face.

Don't you just wanna let me in?

You're gonna need to make a
U-turn and exit immediately.

Uh, n-no, sorry, I can't.
No, no. Uh, hold on.

I'll find it, let me find
it. I know I have it in here.

It's just...

I really need to be...
Security One.

I have to be in Nina
Devon's office in two minutes

and it's my first day,
so I can't be late...

Good morning.

Hi.
Everything okay?

Not really.
You know her, Mr. Devon?

This is Paige Townsen.

She's gonna be a big star.

Whatever you say, boss.

Thank you.

Would you please stop?

There's a lot riding on
tomorrow night's casting party.

We're over budget, and for
now, the studio's looking

the other way, but I, I can't
have you going off on Hopper.

And I can't have the
world hating on Tangey

for something we both did.

I get it, I'll fix it.

Now, just relax.

You know that I've invested
everything in "Locked."

And you know how much I
need this movie to work.

Right?
Of course.

So, stay away from Rainer and Barrett

until I get a chance
to work this out and...

Don't talk to Tangey until I can
smooth things over with her manager.

Did I ask you to set
that meeting for tomorrow?

No, but...
There's that word again.

I pay you so I can hear "Yes.
Nina, yes. I made it happen."

Sit, sit.

Well, that's what an Ivy League
education buys you these days.

"No, but..."

How's it going?

I'm a little nervous.
Do you wanna see a doctor?

We could get you on a mood stabilizer.

Have you been to see Giselle?

What're you wearing tomorrow night?

Actually I'm meeting up with
her later this afternoon.

She, uh, she sounds nice.

Oh, she's a back-stabbing bitch

but she's the best stylist in town.

By the way, Nina, I-I
really wanna thank you again

for letting me bring my friends
to the party tomorrow night.

Are you excited?
Totally.

You know, I just, I have this class

and I'm gonna miss it,
so I kinda feel bad.

But it's okay, 'cause I'm gonna
get notes from somebody there.

I assumed you were taking a gap year.

Uh, of course not. I can do
the movie and stay in school.

I mean, it is an ensemble piece,
just like the books, right?

So, I won't be working every day.

We're playing up the love triangle.

So the role of August is much bigger

in the movies than she was in the books.

Look.

Being a movie star isn't
a part-time job, Paige.

You have to make a choice.

Either you eat, sleep
and breath "Locked"

or, or you spend the rest
of your life doing math

in a poly-blend sweater set.

Any chance you can come
over more than once a week?

It's just that I have school.

I'll pay you an extra fifty.

Um, yeah, yeah, okay.

I-I can make it work.

Great. Look forward to it.

Just let yourself out.

Oh, uh, I think you
accidentally blocked me in.

Oh, my God.

Alexis Glenn?

Wow, I-I never miss an
episode of "Backsplash."

Becky Barnes's, my absolute hero.

Yeah, she was America's sweetheart.

Uh, who am I making this out to?

Thank you. Um, Paige Townsen.

There's-there's no D on the end.

Paige Townsen? You're the new...

You're the new lead in "Locked?"

Yeah. Yeah.

That's-that's, uh, that's me.

Actually, it's my first role in a movie.

Hmm. That part's obvious.

Wait, what?

You know, Paige, just because you won

some sort of cattle call
wearing a push-up bra

and some cheap hair extensions

doesn't really mean you're an actress.

Part's not really yours until
the cameras start rolling.

Those stories in the
press are nothing but lies.

We're considering taking
legal action, Nina.

Ida, we're friends, right?

Ish.

Let's fight bad press with good press.

I'm listening.

What if Tangey booked the
main title song for "Locked?"

That would create some buzz.

What's in it for you?

We're having a casting
party tomorrow night.

We show the world that
Tangey, Rainer and Jordan

are still friends. Everybody wins.

If it means good press, I'll do it.

If she needs to reconcile with your son

we can make that happen.

What? No, no, no. There's no way.

Why don't we let our children work out

their own personal lives?

Okay.

Fine.

If that's what you want, Nina.

I delivered a great audition,
and you gave the part

to this, like, fly-over-state amateur.

Hey, I never made any promises.

Paige Townsen ended up being
the best choice for the role.

Okay.

What about the part
of the dumbass sister?

Well, I'm, I'm about to
put out an offer to someone.

I want that part, Wyatt.

I need it.

Things have been slow for me, lately.

I'm just not sure if
you're right for it.

I see.

Maybe there's a way I
can audition privately.

Alexis, just stop.

I like you, I really like you.

It's always fun when you're around.

What?

I'd like to take you to dinner.

Seriously?

Uh, um...

Fine. Wh-whatever.

This place's cleaned up
pretty nice for your parents.

So who do you think is gonna
be there tomorrow night?

Beyonce? Kim-ye?

Nina made it sound like there's
no way I can do both and...

I believe her.

Look at these spreadsheets,
they don't lie.

They're here.

What do I do? What do I say?

Paige, just breathe.

And for now, just... lie.

I can lie.

I'm a good liar.

Guys, hi!
Hi!

There's our California girl.

I missed you.
Oh, and I missed you.

Good to see you again. Hello. Hello.

Okay, guess who we saw at the airport?

Who?

Carrie Ann Inaba.

She's so cool.
And practically naked.

Honey, I told you she
was wearing a halter top.

Alright, is that what they're
calling a bra nowadays?

Should we get to lunch?

Honey, I'm sorry they
changed the schedule

at the teacher's convention,
literally, last minute.

We're just dropping in to
say hi and we gotta run.

No.
I know.

We-we-we really wanna take
all of you out for dinner

tomorrow night, okay,
and please pick a place

that has famous people.

We can't, uh, we-we have a
huge study group for Econ.

Big group study.
Yeah, it's a big test.

Meteoric, really.
It's half our grade. So...

No. Listen, school comes first.

I'm glad to see you have
your priorities straight.

Very proud of you.

Priorities. Check.

Rachel?

Alexis.
Hi.

Hey, it's been a while.

Yeah, I thought you were in New York.

I was. Um, but turns out
there's no money in theatre.

So, decided to give LA another shot.

Cool.

Uh, so, I heard you
and Dakota are an item.

Happy for you.
Yeah.

Uh, things didn't really work out.

We wanted different things

and uh, she's a bitch.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.

I think I'm gonna get going.

Wait, hang on. We should
get a drink sometime.

I'm pretty busy, getting
settled in and stuff

but I'll call you when
I come up for air, okay?

Is that a Cobb salad you're eating

or the remains of your latest prey?

Alan Mills, seems they'll
let anyone in here these days.

Well, you're proof of that,
how much did "Bombshells"

lose the studio?

Surprised you're not funding
"Locked" on Kickstarter.

What do you want?
I want my film back.

Oh, it's not your film. It never was.

You stole the rights, and you know it.

Well, maybe I did play a little dirty

but it wasn't the first time
and it won't be the last.

Oh, you know how this business works

because I taught you.

I'm sorry, did I
forget to say thank you?

God, you're such a bitch.
Is that the best you can do?

You know, I can't
believe I used to think

you're a hot piece of ass.

Oh, wasn't that a requirement
to be one of your assistants?

It still is.

Unless you're buying my
lunch, I think we're done here.

Oh, no. We're just getting started.

Enjoy your lunch.

Heard you were back in town.

Took you a while to get here.

Yeah, well, I've had
other things on my mind.

Oh, forgive me if I thought
apologizing to your boyfriend

for sleeping with his best
friend might be a priority.

God, you know, I'm, I'm pretty
sure to be someone's boyfriend

you need to actually see them.

If you had any decency

you'd be apologizing to me.

For what?

For the dozen hook-ups you've
had since I've been gone.

God, Rainer, you never even
cared about me or what I needed.

What did you need, Tangey?

Jordan?

You still don't get it.

You know, Jordan's ten
times the man that you are.

And you lost me way
before I slept with him.

You're just too focused
on yourself to realize it.

You know you're in Beverly Hills

when the floor is softer
than anything on your bed.

Should I get one just like it?

Birds of a feather?

It's a little, uh,

peacocky, right?

There's nothing peacocky about Gucci.

Did you try on the Prada yet?

No, wait.

The Walter Mendez will
accentuate your curves better.

Here's some stilettos
to complete the look.

Oh, but, you know, I'm actually
really wobbly when I would...

Eh, she doesn't care.

I'm kind of afraid of her.

And I'm really afraid

my parents are gonna find out the truth.

I mean, w-what do I do, Cass?
I lied straight to their face.

My dad will be so
disappointed in me, and...

Paige, relax, it's an industry party.

There's no way they're
gonna hear about it.

Ladies, are you almost
done? I'm starving.

Almost ready, one sec.

Do you like it?

Amazing.

Pretty.

You look pretty.
Really?

So...

...is this the one?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Definitely. I-I mean, look at you.

I wanna enjoy all of this.

I do, but...

How...

How am I supposed to
get through all of this?

What do you mean?

This. Everything.

Lying to my parents, school, this movie.

It's, it's all just, it's...

It's so much.

It's... too much.

It's just too much
for me to handle and...

And now I feel like my head
is just gonna explode and I...

Paige, it's okay.

We're gonna help you get through this.

Thanks for the sit-down, man.

This will be in our next issue, so...

Jordie Michaels, right?

Nope, you've got the wrong guy.

Well, I-I know you're a big star now.

But you look a lot like a guy...

When you're in movies,
people think they know you.

I promise you, you don't.

Oh, my mistake.

Have a good one, Jordie.

I mean, Jordan.

Happens all the time,
man. You'd be amazed.

Yeah. Thanks for your time.
Yup, thank you.

I heard they offered
you the sister role.

Congrats.

I'm still negotiating.

I'm sorry you didn't get the lead.

Mm-hmm. So, why are you really here?

Apologies aren't usually your thing.

Tangey dropped by.
I know. She called me.

She's actually blaming
me for the breakup.

Like I forced her to sleep with Jordan.

Rain, she was lonely.

You were, like, never around.

She's the one who left.
Yeah, for work.

Why do you even care? It's over.

Just find someone new like you always do

and get sick of her,
and find someone else.

I get it. I'm a terrible boyfriend.

Well, I wouldn't date you.

Really?
Oh!

Baby, I've known you since you were 12.

You're not relationship material.

You seem distracted.

You were there for me when
my life wasn't... great.

You ever tell anyone about my past?

Of course not.

I would never do anything
to jeopardize your career.

You know that.

Forget I even brought it up.
Okay.

That son of a bitch.
They fired Fred Tate.

He's out of the studio.
He's our biggest ally.

Without him, the entire
movie could get shut down.

I'm sorry. I know we still need to talk.

Do you know what I've
been thinking about today?

Freshman theater workshop.

You used to come and watch Cassie

and I slept right through
that horrible one...

That's when I knew
we'd be friends forever.

And that's what you need right now.

A friend.

It wouldn't be right
to complicate things.

You know?

Cassie and I were talking...

What does Cassie have
to do with anything?

I mean, that-that's us, right?

The three <i>amigos.</i> That's
how we've been since freshmen year.

Yeah.
A little help here.

Ah, I got it. Ahem.

Everything okay?

Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

You almost ready? What's wrong?

Um, I-I can't get my
hair out of my dress.

Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

Oh, it's my mom.

What should I say? Do
I say we're studying?

Or you can just answer the
phone and tell me the truth.

Um, y-your mom's here.

Honey, you're a horrible liar.

And you always have been.
I know, I'm sorry.

Are you mad at me?
Mad?

If you're doing what
I think you're doing

I might have a heart
attack, in-in a good way.

When we were here yesterday

I saw the "Locked" script on the table

with your name on it,
next to the role of August.

Are you...

Whoa!

Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

Oh, my God! You won that
at an open casting call.

I know all about it. How's Rainer?

I can't believe Tangey cheated on him.

I can't believe you're
doing a movie with him.

Oh, my gosh! This isn't
just any movie though.

This is "Locked."

Honey, my book club has
read the entire series.

Oh, my gosh!

We thought we were excited
to see "50 Shades of Grey."

Does dad know?

No.
Oh.

But I thought we could tell him tonight.

If we do it together, he'll
know how important this is.

Thank you, mom.

I'll get it.

Rainer!
Cassie, right?

Yeah, yeah, that's, that's me.

Come on in.
Thank you.

Hey, I'm Rainer.

Uh, yeah, I know.

We've hung out.

Oh, right. Sorry.

I meet a lot of people.

Okay, I'm ready.

Oh, Rainer?

Hi.

Um...

What are, uh, what are you doing here?

Your rabbit's a classic.

But I was thinkin'
tonight's star attraction

should arrive like a star.

That's your car outside.

Um, there's room for everyone.

Y-yes, please.

You look beautiful.

Thanks. You do, too.

I mean, not beautiful, of course.

But, like, h-h-handsome.

Very handsome.

Let's go.

Hey!

For the record, when you told Paige

you'd rather be friends

I didn't believe a word of it.

But I know why you did it and it was

a pretty cool thing for you to do.

Look, I just wanted
to simplify her life.

And I didn't see that guy coming.

Oh, my God.

Are those real swans in the pool?

This is not a little party.
This is a very, very big party.

Oh, my God. Is that, is that "Extra?"

Is that a bad thing?
Oh!

My mom watches that show every night.

My dad thinks I'm studying right now.

Texting her as we speak.

No TV after the pina coladas.
Thanks, Cassie.

I have to leave here by 8:30 tonight

so I can tell my dad the truth.

Paige, just take a
breath. I'm here for you.

Yeah, but you can't stand
by my side all night.

This is R in sign language.

Tonight, it's our code.

If you get into a jam
just throw up a sign.

Is that Kim Richards? No,
wait. That's Kim Zolciak.

This is insane. It's like a
buffet of "Real Housewives."

Uh, I-I need a drink.
Do-do you need a drink?

Let's, let's, let's go
get, let's go get a drink.

Oh, Cassie.
Paige! Hi. Alexis Glen.

We met at the studio. Guess what?

I'm gonna be playing your sister.

I have a hunch when this is over

we're gonna be sisters for life.

Paige, um, I wanna steal you here.

Introduce you to some friends.

We'll see you later, Lexi.
Okay.

Hi.
Hi.

Wow, twice in two
days. Pretty crazy, huh?

Yeah. Crazy.

Uh, I'm gonna go talk to a friend.

So, I'll see you later.
Wait.

Look.

I know I made a mistake once,
but I'm a different person now.

I tried therapy.
Yeah?

How many times did you go?
Twice.

Right.

I've missed you.

I've missed you, too.

Can we start over?

I wanna see you again.

Well, didn't Nina tell you?

I got a part in "Locked."

Didn't know it came
with fringe benefits.

Hiding out?

You never did like an industry party.

I just don't want
another scene with Rainer.

I, I haven't heard from you in a while.

Yeah, it's really crazy lately.

It's not right what they're
doing to you because of... us.

I'm sorry.

I'm not.

I mean, the tabloids, tabloids blow.

But, being with you? It was worth it.

Am I interrupting round two?
Hold on, Rainer.

Look, Tangey and I made
a mistake. A big one.

And I'm sorry for that.
You're damn right about that.

We're all gonna be working
on this movie together

whether you like it or
not, so get over yourself

and quit being a little bitch.

You wanna do this again?
Look, step back, man.

You need to step back.
Hey. Hey, that is enough!

That is enough!

You're not goin' to ruin
tonight. Do you hear me?

You have jobs to do out there.

So get it together. Here's the story.

You and Tangey amicably
broke up a month ago

and chose to keep your
private lives private.

And nothing happened
between you and Tangey.

It was an absurd rumor.

You were all friends before

and you're still friends now.

Got it?

Okay, everybody, let's put on a show.

Come on.

And you need to stop
believing your own press.

What?

You may be America's favorite good guy

but I know you sleep with a
different girl every night.

So, stop pretending that
Tangey meant something to you.

Thanks, mom.

Tangey, who are you wearing?
What about the album?

When does it come out?
Tangey?

Can we get any quotes...
Tangey.

Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Hollywood heartthrobs

Rainer Devon as Noah Greer.

And Jordan Wilder as Ed Khan.

You may have conned my mom
into giving you this role

but don't think we're good.

I didn't have to con her into anything.

I got this part based on
my talent, not nepotism.

Next, we have America's sweetheart

Alexis Glenn as Maggie.

And Broadway sensation
Rachel Davis as Layla.

Finally, there's a new face in
Hollywood I'd like you to meet.

After a nationwide talent search

playing our heroine, August Roch

introducing, Paige Townsen!

Whoo!
Go, Paige!

Paige, look this way. Paige, this way.

Look this way, Paige. Hey, over here.

Paige, what's it feel like to

work with the hottest men in Hollywood?

Over here, are you dating anybody?

Paige, where have you been hiding?

Uh, uh, nowhere.

Have we seen you anywhere before?

Um, maybe at the CMU quad.

Hey, take it easy, fellas.

Her studio insurance
policy doesn't kick in

until we start shooting.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the cast of "Locked!"

Hey, it's 8:00 o'clock.
Have you seen Paige?

Uh, not since the announcement.

What are those?

They're like the Swedish meatballs

but more Mexican than Swedish.

Um, I gotta go pee.

Hi.
Oh.

Hi, a-aren't you, uh...

America's sweetheart? Guilty.

Did I see you arrive
earlier with Paige Townsen?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're,
uh, we're good friends.

Well, any friend of
Paige's is a friend of mine.

Yeah, totally. I...

Especially one with
those big brown eyes.

Guilty.

Reach out to all of them, Todd.

God, the new studio
head decides my fate.

Earn your commission for once.

Having fun?
Not really.

Tangey should have been
photographed with the cast.

Why?

You can't become a triple threat

if all you do is sing.

The movie's cast.
Oh.

Then we don't have a
deal on the soundtrack.

Seriously?
Mm.

Have a little gratitude.

Another PR mishap like her last

she'll be lucky if they
let her sing at the mall.

Enjoy the party.

Hey. Nice seeing you.

Brody, hi. Look, nobody
here knows that I...

Hey, I'm Jake.
Hi. Brody.

So are you a client of...
Oh, my God!

It's Selena Gomez!
Where?

Over there!

No. No, th-that's not Selena Gomez.

Oh. My bad.

Who are we looking for?
Uh, no one.

Yuck! Can you believe
her with that goofy grin?

Those have to be veneers, right?

Why do we hate her again?

Oh, thank goodness, you guys are here.

Let's bounce outta here.
Well, we really need...

You're not done yet. You
haven't met Barrett Hopper.

Oh, but, uh, Nina, I should...

I, uh, I really have to leave.
What?

Uh, we were just on our way out.

Uh, Paige's parents
are in town. So we...

And who are you?
Oh, I'm Jake Salt.

I'm Paige's friend.
That was rhetorical.

This is part of your job,
Paige. Your parents can wait.

But, Nina, I...
Let's go.

Do you want us to call your mom?

Paige?
Uh, uh...

I'll shoot Mrs. T another text

while we Uber it at the shake stand.

Wait, what, you're still hungry?

Barrett...
Hi.

It's my pleasure to introduce you

to the star of our little movie.

That hair could be a star on its own.

Well, darling, aren't
you the talk of the town?

Talk to Barrett. Tell
us your life story.

Sorry, I couldn't get
you out of there in time

to talk to your dad.

I'm sorry you and Jordan
are still fighting.

I guess what Nina said
about him and Tangey

wasn't just a rumor.

It's history.

You seem to have a lot of history

with a lot of different people.

Well, not that many, a few.

Okay, quite a few.

Did Jake and Cassie have fun?

They make a cute couple.

They're not dating.

Actually we're all kinda just...

friends.

Good to know.

I've never met anyone quite like you.

Me, too.

I-I'm sorry, honey.
Dad saw you on the news.

Hi, Rainer.

Sorry.

How could you lie like this, hm?

And then make your
mother do your dirty work.

I-I don't even know
who you are right now.

I'm sorry.

I was going to tell you, I swear.

You are throwing away your education

to star in some Hollywood movie...

I told you, this film
is a really big deal.

And I'm not throwing away my education.

I-I found a way to make it work.

Yeah, that's right,
because you're gonna quit.

What?
Yes.

I-I can't. I, I already
made a commitment.

Well, you tell them
you changed your mind.

No!

I...

I won't.

Yes, you taught me

the importance of an education, dad.

But you also taught me

how, how important it is

to dream big.

And, I mean, this is
as big as my dreams get.

I'm...

I'm doing the movie.

I see.

Dad.

He knows you get paid a
lot for this, though, right?

It doesn't matter.

He's worried I'm not
gonna be able to handle

doing school and the movie.

I'm starting to think he's right.

Cassie brought some
dessert home in her purse.

You want a cookie?

What kind of cookie?

I'll go get 'em.

I'll make some tea.

Oh, Jake, your, um...

Nina. Oh, your assistant
wasn't on his desk.

Probably picking up
your Boniva prescription.

Do I need to call security?
Sure.

Tell them your new boss is here.

What?
Oh.

I'm the new head of Gold Brothers, Nina.

And I'm gonna have a lot of fun

making your life a living hell.

Glad we could work this out.

Remember, we agreed on $50 more bucks.

I need the money for school.

Yeah, sure. No problem.

_

I-I'm not sure why we are here.

Nothing's changed since last night.

Dad, I really don't want
you to go home mad at me.

I would like to say I'm not mad.

I'm disappointed, but
that would be a lie.

Something you seem to know a lot about.

Uh, uh, excuse me?

Oh, my God, you're her.

Hey, can I, can I have your autograph?

Uh, um, really?

I can't believe I'm
meeting Paige Townsen.

Uh, can you make it out to Jennifer?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, I can.

I've read "Locked" six times.

August is my favorite
character of all time.

I wrote a paper on her
for my English class.

What grade did you get?
A plus.

Congratulations.

Thanks.
Here you go.

Thanks so much, Jennifer.
Oh, my God!

Thank you. Oh, my God!

Hey, Paige, this is incredible.
You're famous already.

Okay, y-you're sure
you can make this movie

and stay at school?

I promise I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to do both.

Well, I'm not sure it's doable

but I guess I could
make up a spreadsheet

to help you with your schedule.

I would love that, dad.

Okay, so what's this "Locked"
story about? What is this?

Um...
