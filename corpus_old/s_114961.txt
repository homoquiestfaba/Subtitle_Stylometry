46-99402.

Transfer to 53-01138.

What'd we just do?

The Republican Party just made
a donation to the Black Panthers.

Farm out.
Right arm.

Who's next?
Let's see.

Richard Nixon's personal checking account
is in here.

This is a challenge.

Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

How about the National Association
to Legalize Marijuana?

Perfect. How much should he give?

He's a generous man. I'd say,
all he's got. God, I'm hungry!

Marty...

...you're sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

Cosmo, trust me.

Posit: The phone company
has too much money.

Good one.
Consequence?

They're corrupt. Result?

The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

Conclusion?
Ma Bell needs to donate some money.

We're gonna change the world.

I just wish we could get course credit
for this. Gosh!

You gotta eat. You want some food?

Loser goes.

I never lose.

Pepperoni pizza, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

Power to the people, Cos.
Power to the people, Marty.

One cannot trust anybody these days.

No, don't do this.

Marty! Marty!

Martin.

Martin.

It's time.

How're we doing?

Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

Whistler is reading.

We're up.

What's with the lobby?

Still just the one guard.

Okay, Mother,
try the ones coming off the blue trunk.

Nope.

Try the ones coming off the white trunk.
These don't sound right.

<i>Hold on.</i>

We even have photos
of the guy leaving the embassy...

...through the back service entrance.

Hey, Crease, you on?

Yeah, I'm on.

<i>Were you still in the CIA in '72?</i>

Yeah, why?

Did you know the Deputy
Director of Planning...

...was in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

What are you saying?
The CIA caused the Managua earthquake?

I can't prove it, but...

I can't talk to that guy.

Hold on, Mother. Go back one.

Bingo!

Securing bridge clips.

Preparing to sever master alarm circuit.

Five, four...

<i>I looked in that box just now.</i>

<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

Nice bank?

You wouldn't believe what I had to do
to get a safe deposit box.

Shit. We're gettin' too old for this.

<i>- Westguard Security.
Yeah, I got a fire at Centurion Bank.</i>

<i>We got the alarm. Are there any
secondary indications? Smoke or flame?</i>

No.

<i>Probably a false alarm. We've been
getting them in your area all night.</i>

<i>- See if it resets.
Man, I don't know.</i>

Sure you know which one to cut?
Yes! The alarm's always the green one.

Good, Carl.

I'm not waitin' any longer.
I'm callin' the fire...

It stopped. Sorry.

<i>- No problem. And, son?
Sir?</i>

<i>- Good work.
Thank you, sir.</i>

All yours, Bish.

So, how much do you want?

$80,000, $90,000, $100,000.

Okay.

May I ask why you're closing
your account with us today, sir?

I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

Gentlemen, your communication lines
are vulnerable.

Fire exits need to be monitored.

Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained.

Outside of that,
everything seems to be fine.

You'll get our full report in a few days.
But first, who's got my check?

So, people hire you
to break into their places...

...to make sure no one
can break into their places?

It's a living.

Not a very good one.

Thank you.

Is that him?

Yeah, that's him.

Who's got the report for the bank sneak?

I'm gonna type it up later.
You are?

We haven't paid the typist since January,
so it's me or Whistler.

Better Whistler.
We've got customers.

Shoes?
Expensive.

Look busy, guys.

Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
Hi.

Buddy Wallace.
Hi.

We've heard great things about you.
They're all true.

Thanks, Carl.

Let's go to the conference room.
You can tell us how we can help.

Okay.
Thank you.

So here...
Before we begin...

...there's something we'd like to clear up.

Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

But your team...

I know, kind of different.
Yes, you are.

Darren Roskow, also known as "Mother".

Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

Carl Arbogast, age 19.

Caught breaking into the Oakland School
District computer to change his grades.

I know. We're the ones who caught him.

Irwin Emery, also known as "Whistler".

He had some little problem
with the phone company.

Sixty-two counts?

You want law enforcement?

How about Donald Crease?
Twenty-two year veteran of the CIA.

Terminated, 1987. Why was that?

I don't know. I think a personality conflict.
Who are you?

Relax, Marty.
We have to check these things.

Everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

And then there's Martin Bishop.

He doesn't seem to have a past.

Sorry to waste your time.
I don't work for the government.

We know.

National Security Agency.

You're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

No, that's the FBI.

We're not chartered
for domestic surveillance.

I see. You just overthrow governments,
set up friendly dictators.

No, that's the CIA.

We protect government communications,
try to break the other fellow's codes.

We're the good guys, Marty.

I can't tell you what a relief that is, Dick.

All right, that's enough.

Let's go.

If you change your mind...

...call us at this number...

...Mr. Brice.

Help me out?

Spare a quarter? Help me out.

The government's taken away my home.

Talk to him.

Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

We're all friends here, right? Easy, easy.

Want some coffee or something?
No.

Buddy, is that Janek's file?
Yeah, Janek's file.

This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

Specializes in large-number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

Cryptography.
Very good.

Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

Way out of profile for a guy like that.

It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

I know you're not gonna say Russia.
Yeah.

Give me a break.

We won, they lost.
It's been in a couple of papers.

We still spy on them. They still spy on us.

We intercepted a fax last week. Here.

He's making some kind of box,
a little black box.

The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

Security technology...
Sensor techniques, who knows?

It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

No way.

Sorry, Marty.

We don't have a lot of choice here.

Do it yourself.
We can't.

By law, we're not allowed
to do this kind of operation.

Then get the FBI.

Yeah, right, the FBI.

The FBI can't work for us without approval
from a congressional committee.

We don't have the time.
So why me?

Frankly, because we...
Yeah, frankly.

Marty, sit down, please.

Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

We know you can keep your mouth shut.
Job pays $175,000, payable on delivery.

You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

Pass.
We also clean up your record.

Quash the outstanding warrant
for your arrest.

Your pal Cosmo got 12 years.

That was without flight
to evade prosecution.

We all know what happened
to him in there.

If I say no?

Don't say no.

What good would you do anybody
in prison?

I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

Even lied to us about your name.
Sorry, okay?

I'm sorry, but when you're wanted
by the feds, you don't go telling everybody.

We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

We all have our little secrets, don't we?

Look, you guys have a decision to make.

This is not a test.

The penetration is live,
the target is unaware.

Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

The probable level of security is very low.

But if you guys don't want to take
that chance just to keep me out of jail...

...fine, I understand, don't do it.

Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other guys,
but I'm in it for the money.

I don't care if you go to jail.
Me neither. I'm in.

Could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

It pays $175,000!

I'm in.

You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.

All right, what do we need?

We start with a very light surveillance.

Level three. First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

He's giving a lecture tomorrow at U.C.

I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

Let's do it.

For the lecture, you want
to take Whistler or do you want me?

No, that's okay, I thought I'd ask Liz.

Who's this?

Sort of an old friend.

Practice! Practice, practice!

Hi.
We're not getting back together.

Did I say anything?
You will.

I'm here on business, Liz.

Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

You have a clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

Liz, I need your help.

I will not be dragged back into your world.

I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

Excuse me.

There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

I've read him. Now go away.

He's giving a master lecture at 3:30...
How nice for him.

I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
I am not going out with you.

This isn't a date, dummy.
This is a scientific exploration, a tutorial.

I need you...

...to explain it to me.

Read a book.

They found me, Liz.

The government found me.

They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

...they clear my record,
and I can get my name back.

You and I are not getting back together.

Don't flatter yourself.

Pick me up at 3:00.

Yes!

While the number-field sieve
is the best method currently known...

...there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

This guy's good.

...over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms...

You seeing anybody?

This isn't just about large-number theory.
It's about cryptography.

You mean codes?

I mean unbreakable codes.

It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

...and allow us to acquire...

...the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

Are you seeing...

Such an approach is purely theoretical.
So far, no one has been able...

...to accomplish such constructions...

...yet.

The numbers are so unbelievably big...

...all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

But maybe, just maybe...

...there's a shortcut.
I'll bet you anything he's found it.

If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

Numbers themselves
may be our best tools...

...may be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

Martin.

Martin, how wonderful to see you.

Hi, Greg. How are you?
Is it not fabulous?

Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

At least I...

Goodness, can it be?

Yeah.

Elizabeth!
She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

Elizabeth.

Hello, Greg.
Elizabeth and Martin.

My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

No? What a pity.

Wait. I have smashing idea. Martin!

Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

You will be my guests.

Really, Greg,
I wouldn't know how to repay you.

Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

...perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

Gregor, you are shameless.
See you Thursday night.

What?

New title.

Cultural Attaché.

Unbelievable!

Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

I'll bet.

I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

I don't trust that guy.

Who, Greg? He's harmless.

Let the number itself tell us.

If you'll excuse me...

...I have some work.
You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

It's okay. I'll get a cab.

Can I call you?

Just be careful.

Janek just got in the elevator.

Going up.
We will be ready for him.

How's the audio?
Good. Mother's close.

He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

What, no parachute?

All right. Entry and lights on.

Describe it.
Looks like a workroom.

A bench with a soldering gun,
two spools of wire and a magnifying lamp.

Sounds like he's making somethin'.

Then a desk.

Telephone, lamp, answering machine.

A jar of pencils, but no little black box.

It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

He's logging on the computer.

This is good.

He's gonna type in his password,
and we're gonna get a clear shot.

<i>Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.</i>

Let's get an ID on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

She was trying to tell him something
and it was making him...

<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

<i>Let's do what we did in Mexico City.</i>

I didn't know you could do that
in Mexico City.

Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a look?
Carl.

Grow up.

<i>- Let me see.
Oh, Gunter.</i>

<i>Elena, really!</i>

<i>I must finish my work.</i>

Okay, back to work.

Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, really.</i>

Get out of the way. She's in the way.

<i>- I don't believe this.
I'm sorry.</i>

<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

<i>I give you something to work, baby.</i>

<i>Okay. Just for a little while.</i>

<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

What's goin' on?
Nothing.

<i>Elena, really!</i>

<i>I must finish my work.</i>

<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

Maybe there's a frame
where she doesn't block it.

I'll blow it up.

Gentlemen.
Who's Rhyzkov?

Dr. Elena Rhyzkov,
visiting professor from Czechoslovakia...

...senior research fellow in astrophysics.

Bingo.
Setec Astronomy, whatever that is.

<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

<i>- There.
I'm sorry.</i>

"W", "G"...
Looks like the "H".

Where do you get "H"?
Next to the "L".

Come on. Do it again.
"H" isn't next to the "L".

<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

Okay, that's definitely "W", "G".

Definitely not. No, that's a "V".

She's in the way.

Fellas, Janek's little black box
is on his desk...

...between the pencil jar and the lamp.

Whistler, I hate to tell you this,
but you're blind.

Play the tape back again.

But you can't see anything.
Don't look. Listen.

Play it back.

<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not...</i>

He's got a service.

What's he need an answering machine for?

There's our little black box.

Okay, boss.

This LTX-71 concealable mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

...when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

The astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage...

...at Norton Air Force Base,
San Bernardino, California.

So it worked for them.
It shouldn't give us too many problems.

Thanks.

You didn't have a delivery?
I should have the invoice.

No delivery is scheduled.
They didn't have anything on record.

Did my wife drop a cake off for me?

There's no cake here.
Party for Marge on the second floor.

She was supposed to drop a cake off.
I don't know about it.

There she is, late as usual.

It states here that I am to deliver
36 boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

I don't care what that says.
You're not on the list, you can't get in.

I might lose my job.
That's not my problem. Now beat it.

I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this?

Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
Wait one minute.

We're late for a party on the second floor.
Push the goddamned buzzer.

Thanks.

Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic keypad?

Don't even joke about that.
Those things are impossible.

Think I'm joking?
Looks like they just put it in.

Oh, boy.

This might help. An old buddy of mine
who was in Desert Storm sent it to me.

'Course, he was on the other side.

<i>Come on. There's got to be
a way around these things.</i>

All right, all right.

This might work.

Yeah. Yeah.

Right.

Okay. I'll give it a shot.

It worked.

Got it.

Gunter? You're not...
God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

Who the hell is that?
Battle stations.

Monitor the audio. Grab the mike.

Okay.

I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, don't scream.

I promise, nothing will happen to you.

Okay?

Who are you?

He's a PI.
You're a private investigator.

I'm a private investigator.
But why?

Who hired you?

Who hired you?
Mrs. Janek.

There is not Mrs. Janek.

Yeah?

You got us stumped.

Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid
for your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

That was good.

Velma Janek.

She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings...

...vast real estate holdings:
Farms, banks, shopping malls.

Two shopping malls.

She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

Bastard liar!

I'll kill him!
No, no, no!

No, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

Get a hold of yourself.

You gotta not tell him you know.

We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

You don't know anything about a wife.

You just give me one good reason why.

I'll give you a reason.

Give you a really good reason.

It's just what she'd want you to do.

It's just what she'd want you to do.

It's just what she'd want you to do.

I don't understand.

Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

Look, I might lose my license for this...

...but my client is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

She's been withholding marital favors
for years and now she's out to ruin him.

And she's using you to get to her.

And she's using me to get to you.

I know that's confusing,
but don't you see what's happening here?

You and me,
we're pawns in this ugly little game.

If you love him...
lf you love him...

If you love him...

...if you really love him...

...then just keep on loving him.

Never let him know that you know what
he thinks you don't know that you know.

You know?

And give him head whenever he wants.

Give him help.

Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.

Can you do that for Gunter?

Yes, yes, I can. I can.
Okay, good.

Now get outta here.

Give him head?

Be a beacon?

The key meeting took place July 1, 1958.

The Air Force brought this space visitor
to the White House...

...for an interview with Eisenhower.

Ike said, "Give us technology,
we'll give you all the cow lips you want."

Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable.

Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

He's ex-CIA. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

Understood, understood.

One thing I don't quite get, though...

...was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these big chances...

...what for?

We were young. And there was a war on.

It was a good way to meet girls.
I'll bet.

How come you didn't get caught?

I went out for pizza.

Then I went to Canada.

I was lucky. He wasn't.

Did he ever forgive you?

I hope so.

He died in prison.

So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

Don?

We have never been to Europe together.

And we are going.

Madrid, Lisbon.
Athens and Scotland.

And Tahiti.
Yes, yes.

Mother?
Well, you know...

...I've never actually had a really cool car
that I could fit comfortably into.

So I think I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago...

...with a big kitchen, water bed.
Big kitchen.

Carl?

I'd like to have a deep relationship...

...with a beautiful woman, who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

We're not getting paid that much, Carl.

Well, you know, someone like Liz.

You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

Whistler?

Peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

Right on.

And women.

All right.
Hear, hear!

That's not a word, "scrunchy".
Yes, it is.

Scrunchy is not a word.
Scrunchy is a word.

Since when?
Know what happens to your face?

It's not a word.
Right now your face is scrunchy.

All right. We gotta take it as a word.

I have...
I didn't invent the word.

Carl?
Yes?

What does it say where this is?

Hold on a second here.

"System out."

Guys...

...I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

Yeah, I know. I just wanted
to see something. Don't worry, Don.

How are they spelling Setec?
S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

Special extraterrestrial?

Earthling counter.

Is that right? Two, four, five.

And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

...and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

Setec.
What?

Setec Astronomy.

I just love it when a man says that to me.

Setec doesn't mean anything.

Excuse me.

Carl...

...can you get me some cable
and that l/O interface, please?

"Monterey's coast."

Does "Monterey's coast"
mean anything to you guys?

No.
No.

Here, help me with this.

Carl, get the diagnostics.

How about "my Socrates note"?

No.

No, I don't...
No. No.

Got it. Move to another one.

Give me another one.

Stay in that quadrant.

It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

Mother, what was that? Go back one.

All right.

Holy cow.

What the hell is this?

"Too many secrets."

Bish, I think you better come over here.

Carl, got your black book?
Yes.

Give me the number
for something impossible to access.

Okay. What about this?

Federal Reserve Transfer Node,
Culpepper, Virginia.

Yeah, sure. Good luck.
900 billion a day go through there.

That'll do. Punch it in.

Okay. We won't get in.

It's encrypted.

See?

Mother, that last contact.

Look at this, boys.

Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

Don't screw around with that thing!
Wait.

Carl, what else you got?
National power grid?

Okay.

Here we come. Hey, Mother.

Probing.

Unbelievable.

Anybody want to black out New England?
Carl, what else?

Air traffic control system.

Okay, Mother.

Oh, my God.

How is this possible?

Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

...so complex they cannot be solved
without a key.

Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

...and he hard-wired it into that chip.
Turn it off.

Want to crash some passenger jets?
I said turn it off.

Turn it off.

So it's a code-breaker.

No, it's the code-breaker.

No more secrets.

Honey, you and Melissa get your things.

Night-night.
Good night.

What time is the hand-off?

9:00 a.m.

Well, between now and then, we are going
to institute some security around here.

This is where I get off.

Nice to see you again. I'm out of here.

Don't take this personally, Liz...

...but you were the only one
who knew Martin's secret.

Somebody talked.

So make yourself comfortable.
We're all staying right here tonight.

No.

I'm getting my bag, and I'm leaving.

So relax, Crease.

I'll relax when we get that damn thing
out of here. Until then, you stay.

What?

There isn't a government on this planet
that wouldn't kill us all for that thing.

Sorry.
I see.

Carl, would you get the alarm?

Mother, lock everything down.
Unplug that thing.

Kill the lights.
You bet.

Thank you for the trust, fellas.

I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

Bye, Liz.
You too, Liz.

I hope the hand-off goes well.

I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

Martin? Time.

Yeah.

Morning. Any problems?

Nope.
Want a cappuccino?

No.

Got his check?

Hey, Martin!

Telephone!
Just a minute.

It's your mother.

She's old. Excuse me.

Get in the car.
What?

Get in the car.

I didn't get the money.

Now!

What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

Janek's dead.

They killed him.

The NSA doesn't kill people, Martin.
Who are they?

You said there isn't a government
on earth that wouldn't kill for that thing.

Not ours. Who were those guys?

There's one way to find out.

They took away my home. Help me out?

The government took away my home.

My God.

Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

And don't tell me you won't do it
because I've got to have it.

I need to know, and I need to know now.

Guys, that federal building's been
scheduled for demolition since August.

Housed the Federal Trade Commission,
and Dept. Of Agriculture.

Been vacant for a month.

The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

Their West Coast operations are out
of Los Angeles.

Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

Janek's grant is from the NSA.

How could you be so goddamn stupid?

Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

They probably were government...

...just not ours.

Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

What are you doing?
I'm going to a concert.

Keep smiling.

Martin, have you lost your mind?
Excuse yourself.

Darling, would you excuse me
for a moment?

Give me back Janek's box, Greg.
Martin, I don't have it.

Now you must believe me.
No.

You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

Not for lack of trying, mind you.

Your codes are entirely different from ours.

We never had any luck in breaking them
so Lord knows, I wanted that box...

...but we did not take it.

Then who did?

What I will tell you now,
I cannot tell you in this building.

Do you understand?

Come.

Martin.

You must trust me.

Him?
No.

Him?
No.

Him?
No.

I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

You still keep tabs on all our agents.

These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

Then we had financial troubles.

That's him. The older guy.

A loathsome man named Buddy Devries,
a.k.a. Buddy Weber...

...Buddy Wallace.
Wallace. That's him.

We tried to recruit him in '83.

Drinking problem, married three times.

Left the NSA four years ago.

Oh, my.

What?

What?

You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

Why? Who's he workin' for?

Your FBI is such a pain in the ass.

Who's he workin' for?

Martin, I can offer you
asylum inside this car.

Technically, it's part of the consulate.
Do you wish our protection?

What? Who is Wallace working for?

Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

Please, step out of the vehicle.

Do you wish our protection?
Mr. Bishop...

...get out of the vehicle now.

You won't know who to trust.

Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

Is this loaded?

Yes.

Too many secrets.

Oh, shit.
What are you doin' up?
