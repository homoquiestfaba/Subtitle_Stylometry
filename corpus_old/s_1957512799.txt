<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

<i>Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.</i>

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

<i>Aw, thank you so much. Thank you.</i>

<i>Awâ€¦ That's so nice.</i>

<i>That almost makes me forget
we're all gonna be dead in a week.</i>

<i>I'm kidding. It'll probably be a month.</i>

<i>Remember when we thought
the pandemic was over?</i>

<i>Everyone was so happy.</i>

<i>"We did it!"</i>

<i>We probably looked so stupid.</i>

<i>Everyone was patting themselves
on the back.</i>

<i>"You know, I'm just glad
I could help out the sick,</i>

<i>by staying inside."</i>

<i>"It's not over?
Well, I'm not going back in."</i>

<i>"Those sick people have to die."</i>

<i>'Cause it's not over.</i>

<i>The pandemic is like a TV show
you thought was canceled,</i>

<i>and then it got picked up by Netflix.</i>

<i>Ohâ€¦</i>

<i>I didn't really pace myself
for another season.</i>

<i>I don't know about you, I wasn't
planning on seeing my family ever again.</i>

<i>Parents know the feeling.</i>

<i>It's like changing that diaper
in the middle of the night.</i>

<i>You're exhausted. It's disgusting.</i>

<i>But you have to do it.</i>

<i>So you change the diaper,
you finally get the sleeper back on,</i>

<i>and as you gently lay the baby
back in the crib,</i>

<i>you hear the diaper fill up again.</i>

<i>And that's what the year 2021 is.</i>

<i>Over and over.</i>

<i>It's just a diaper filling up
over and over.</i>

<i>I kind of miss the early days
of the pandemic.</i>

<i>Those were fun.</i>

<i>Back when we thought washing our hands
would protect us.</i>

<i>"Everyone, wash your hands.
We'll be fine."</i>

<i>"Okay."</i>

<i>Remember before
there were readily available tests,</i>

<i>everyone had that friend that used
to brag "Yeah, I already had COVID."</i>

<i>"I had it back in '91."</i>

<i>"Yeah. Back then, it
was called COVID-91."</i>

<i>"Had it a couple times.
Got rid of it by washing my hands."</i>

<i>'Cause the symptoms were confusing.</i>

<i>They're still confusing.</i>

<i>It's like, "What are the symptoms?"</i>

<i>"Everything."</i>

<i>"What do you mean, everything?"</i>

<i>"Asking a question is a symptom."</i>

<i>"Well, that can't be true."</i>

<i>"Denial is a major symptom."</i>

<i>Did you wipe down your groceries?
I did that.</i>

<i>It felt so silly.</i>

<i>You know, like, "I'm just a normal guy
cleaning a Triscuit box."</i>

<i>"Is this what OCD feels like?"</i>

<i>Couple weeks later, you're like,
"Nah, they look clean to me."</i>

<i>"I cleaned 'em."</i>

<i>But you had to take the precautions.</i>

<i>There was no uniformity.
Everyone talked a big game, right?</i>

<i>"Oh, we're on lockdown."</i>

<i>"No work, no school, you know."</i>

<i>"We got our bubble."</i>

<i>"Bubble's just my family
and these two people we see</i>

<i>at a weekly sex party."</i>

<i>"I figured, better safe than sorry."</i>

<i>'Cause we all went through
the same pandemic,</i>

<i>but we didn't have
the same experience, right?</i>

<i>There were factors.</i>

<i>Like, if you were 25 and healthy,</i>

<i>you're like, "Whatever.
I'm going on a COVID cruise."</i>

<i>But if you were over the age of 25...</i>

<i>And it may surprise you, but I amâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦you watched the
news more closely, right?</i>

<i>The news guys would be like,
"High-risk people are older."</i>

<i>You're like, "Well, how old?"</i>

<i>"Like old old,</i>

<i>or didn't-have-a-cellphone-
in-high-school old?"</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>'Cause nobody thinks
of themselves as old.</i>

<i>The reality of your age just
occasionally slaps you across the face.</i>

<i>I did this benefit for a hospital.
It was a fancy event.</i>

<i>When I showed up,
the woman running the event was like,</i>

<i>"Oh, my gosh.
We went to the same college."</i>

<i>She was younger, but we talked</i>

<i>and we realized we hung out
at the same places.</i>

<i>At the end of the event,
I was leaving and she ran up to me,</i>

<i>she was like, "I need to know
what year you graduated college."</i>

<i>I was like, "1988."</i>

<i>And she was like, "Oh, my gosh.
That's the year I was born."</i>

<i>Slap!</i>

<i>Right across the face.</i>

<i>I didn't even know what to say.</i>

<i>I was like,
"Ah, that's the year I was born too."</i>

<i>She looked at me like,
"That's not funny."</i>

<i>And then I got in my car
and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

<i>until I stopped feeling anything.</i>

<i>Sometimes you had to decipher
the news. Right?</i>

<i>The newscaster would be like,</i>

<i>"The vulnerable are
older and people with comorbidities."</i>

<i>You're like, "Co what?"</i>

<i>"Comorbidity."</i>

<i>Which eventually we figured out
was just code for,</i>

<i>"All the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

<i>But they couldn't say that on the news.</i>

<i>They couldn't have Sanjay Gupta be like,</i>

<i>"Well, Anderson,
all the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

<i>So they said comorbidities.</i>

<i>And at home, we were like,
"Honey, what is a comorb..."</i>

<i>"I don't know. Pass the gravy."</i>

<i>In time, we figured out
they were talking about fat people.</i>

<i>And if you were overweight,
you were like, "How fat?"</i>

<i>Or like, "Are we talking Walmart fat
or Jim Gaffigan fat?"</i>

<i>I got the message.</i>

<i>I dunno, I totally got the message.
I started working out.</i>

<i>I started eating healthy.
I was going good.</i>

<i>Then one day I looked in the mirror
and I was like, "Ah, enough of that."</i>

<i>Turns out, life or death, not the
motivator you'd think it would be.</i>

<i>"You could live longer."</i>

<i>"Not a good enough reason."</i>

<i>"Can you sweeten the deal,
maybe throw in a pizza?"</i>

<i>I tried. I tried.</i>

<i>My wife bought me a scale,</i>

<i>so the romance is still alive.</i>

<i>I didn't ask for it. She gave it to
me as a gift.</i>

<i>I could never do something like that.</i>

<i>"Happy birthday, honey.
I bought you a scale and some makeup."</i>

<i>"Just lookin' out for you, sweetie."</i>

<i>It's a high-tech scale.</i>

<i>Comes with an app so the government
can know how overweight I am.</i>

<i>I don't know why there's an app.</i>

<i>Maybe so I can be the victim
of Ransomware.</i>

<i>"Pay up or we're
telling everyone how fat you are."</i>

<i>"But I don't have any crypto currency."</i>

<i>I set up the app, stood on the scale,</i>

<i>my weight showed up on the phone,
150 pounds.</i>

<i>All right, it was over 200.</i>

<i>All right, it was way over 200.</i>

<i>If it was an old-fashioned scale,
you wouldn't see the number 200.</i>

<i>But it was in the 200 family.</i>

<i>And underneath my weight, on the phone,</i>

<i>there was this word
in small red lettering.</i>

<i>I didn't have my glasses on
so I asked my daughter.</i>

<i>I was like, "What does that say?"
She was like, "Obese."</i>

<i>Slap! Right across the face.</i>

<i>I just looked at my daughter,
I'm like, "Ah, I gotta update this app."</i>

<i>And then I ran to the kitchen
and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

<i>till I stopped feeling anything.</i>

<i>Still wearing masks.</i>

<i>There was that time
when nobody had to wear a mask, right?</i>

<i>That was a fun day.</i>

<i>Remember the first time you went out
in public without a mask?</i>

<i>It was weird, right?</i>

<i>You felt naked.
You were like, "Oh, I'm so European."</i>

<i>"What is this, the French Riviera?"</i>

<i>I was kind of tempted to wear,
like, a thong mask.</i>

<i>You know, something
tasteful yet naughty.</i>

<i>"I can see his cheeks,
but there's still a mystery."</i>

<i>"Ooh-la-la."</i>

<i>â™ª Round and pale and mostly balding â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The boy from Indiana goes walking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And as he does
All the people he pass go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª "Yuck!" â™ª</i>

<i>Initially, it was strange seeing
other people's faces without a mask.</i>

<i>You wanted to go up to some people like,
"You should stick with the mask."</i>

<i>"It's a better look for you.
You in a mask is better for everyone."</i>

<i>Did you meet anyone during the pandemic
where you only knew them with a mask?</i>

<i>And then when you finally
saw them barefaced,</i>

<i>you're like, "Yikes."</i>

<i>You felt like you were catfished.</i>

<i>You're like, "Wow, your face
doesn't match your voice at all."</i>

<i>"And who stole your chin?"</i>

<i>Of course, the biggest reveal
of the pandemic</i>

<i>was how many crazy people there are.</i>

<i>That was a bit of a surprise.</i>

<i>We all knew there were
some Unabombers out there, but,</i>

<i>nobody thought there were that many.</i>

<i>Or that we were related
to a couple of them.</i>

<i>You know?</i>

<i>'Cause everyone had
that relative or friend</i>

<i>that came out as bonkers.</i>

<i>"I no longer believe in reality."</i>

<i>"Good to know."</i>

<i>It was like a gender
reveal for insanity.</i>

<i>"The truth is no longer true."</i>

<i>"See you at Thanksgiving."</i>

<i>I feel like it happened
for me more often</i>

<i>'cause I've always had friends
that are eccentric thinkers</i>

<i>and they're normally
really entertaining.</i>

<i>They're like,
"Bigfoot's real, man. Bigfoot is real."</i>

<i>But that same person, at one point
during the pandemic, was like,</i>

<i>"Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

<i>"Don't say that."</i>

<i>"Tom Hanks does eat babies."</i>

<i>"And if you don't believe that,
then you eat babies."</i>

<i>"All right."</i>

<i>"Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

<i>"He always seemed
like a baby-eater to me."</i>

<i>The thing I missed most
during the lockdown was restaurants.</i>

<i>I know that's a surprise.</i>

<i>I didn't even realize
how much I missed restaurants</i>

<i>'til the first time I went out to eat</i>

<i>and I caught myself catcalling
other people's food.</i>

<i>"Oh, yeah."</i>

<i>"What I would do to you."</i>

<i>"Get me a fork and knife."</i>

<i>"Jim, you're in public."
"Oh, sorry."</i>

<i>This is gonna kind of sound pandering,</i>

<i>but I believe the pandemic
has been hardest on mothers.</i>

<i>Definitely hardest on mothers. Right?</i>

<i>Or the men who had to live
with those mothers.</i>

<i>It was insane for...
I don't know how my wife did it.</i>

<i>We had five children
doing distance-learning.</i>

<i>And my kids were good.</i>

<i>They totally kept a distance
from learning.</i>

<i>We asked children to do school</i>

<i>on the same device they play Minecraft .</i>

<i>It's like holding
a Weight Watchers meeting</i>

<i>in a Wendy's.</i>

<i>I mean, it was insane.</i>

<i>I definitely gained an appreciation</i>

<i>for how difficult it is to be a teacher.</i>

<i>And what a poor career choice that was.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>I guess it was, uh, after the first case
of Scotch, I turned to my wifeâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦and I said, "When this is over,
if there's even an opening,</i>

<i>I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
Wherever you wanna go."</i>

<i>My wife was like,
"I want to go to Hawaii."</i>

<i>And I was like,
"I was thinking more Tri-State area."</i>

<i>She was like, "I wanna go to Hawaii
and I wanna bring the kids."</i>

<i>And I was like, "Whose kids?"</i>

<i>She was like, "Our kids."</i>

<i>I did the research,
saw that it was cheaper than a divorce,</i>

<i>so we went to Hawaii.</i>

<i>Andâ€¦</i>

<i>Hawaii is such a special place.
It really is.</i>

<i>It's like there's the "Aloha Spirit",</i>

<i>where people greet each other
with "Aloha," but I'm so awkward,</i>

<i>so they'll be like, "Aloha,"
and I'll be like, "Hello ha."</i>

<i>Does that mean something? That meansâ€¦</i>

<i>Even when I would use
the Hawaiian terms properly,</i>

<i>it would backfire.</i>

<i>Like if I said, "Mahalo,"
the natives would look at me like,</i>

<i>"You don't have to do that."</i>

<i>"Just nod your head
and we'll bring you pork."</i>

<i>'Cause I stuck out in Hawaii.</i>

<i>I didn't even look like a tourist.</i>

<i>I looked like someone they brought in</i>

<i>to make the tourists feel
more comfortable.</i>

<i>"You're fine. You wanna see awkward,
look at Jim Gaffigan."</i>

<i>Hawaii, it's incomparable
to any other state.</i>

<i>It's a tropical paradise.</i>

<i>It's almost like Hawaii
was this Polynesian island nation</i>

<i>that we just took over.</i>

<i>You know what I mean?</i>

<i>Like, it wasn't even part
of the United States.</i>

<i>We just went in like
it was an open house.</i>

<i>"Nice. Nice."</i>

<i>"We could do our honeymoon here.
We'll take it."</i>

<i>The Hawaiians were like,
"We're our own country."</i>

<i>"That's cute. I love your flower shirt.
Gotta get one of them."</i>

<i>And Hawaiians will tell you,
they'll come right up to you.</i>

<i>They'll be, "You stole this land."</i>

<i>And I'm like, "Don't know how to break
it to you, but we stole all the land."</i>

<i>"Probably just stings a little more
'cause it's pretty here."</i>

<i>"Believe me, there's people in Detroit
pissed at us."</i>

<i>My wife chose Hawaii
because my wife loves the beach.</i>

<i>And as you can see, so do I.</i>

<i>I spent the entire time applying
and re-applying sunscreen</i>

<i>which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter.</i>

<i>What cruel bastard decided</i>

<i>that the goo that protects
pale people from the sun</i>

<i>should also make them look
like White Walkers?</i>

<i>It'sâ€¦ it's just cruel.</i>

<i>They should offer other colors.</i>

<i>"Cool. There's one of the guys
from Blue Man Group."</i>

<i>I don't even know why sunscreen
is white. What was the thinking?</i>

<i>"Well, you know, those pale people
love ranch dressing, soâ€¦"</i>

<i>"â€¦let's keep it in their wheelhouse."</i>

<i>'Cause I don't tan. I don't kind of tan.</i>

<i>There's no medium rare for me.</i>

<i>I either look
like I've never been outside,</i>

<i>or I was just released from a burn unit.</i>

<i>There's no in-between.</i>

<i>And I know people go
to the beach to relax.</i>

<i>People find the beach very relaxing.</i>

<i>Not so much for me.</i>

<i>It's like being allergic to bees</i>

<i>and then, for vacation,
becoming a beekeeper.</i>

<i>My one goal was to just not burn.</i>

<i>I didn't want to be the sunburned adult.</i>

<i>You see a kid with a sunburn,
you're like, "Parenting is hard."</i>

<i>You see an adult with a sunburn,
you're like,</i>

<i>"That's an alcoholic."</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>'Causeâ€¦</i>

<i>A sunburn on an adult</i>

<i>is like a scarlet letter</i>

<i>for poor judgment.</i>

<i>There is no excuse.</i>

<i>"Well, I was caught
off-guard this time."</i>

<i>"I didn't know the fireball in the sky
would be hot this time."</i>

<i>When we weren't
at the beach, we did activities.</i>

<i>I went zip-lining for the last time.</i>

<i>What is wrong with us?</i>

<i>"Hey, you wanna feel like
you're about to die?"</i>

<i>"Would you pay 200 dollars to feel like
you're about to die six times?"</i>

<i>Why don't you just walk into traffic?</i>

<i>"Did you see that bus almost hit me?
I feel so alive."</i>

<i>Why don't you just take off your mask
at a biker rally?</i>

<i>You know?</i>

<i>If you've been zip-lining,
you know to slow down,</i>

<i>you have to spread
out your arms and legs.</i>

<i>That supposedly slows you down.</i>

<i>It also makes it look like a suicide.</i>

<i>"Oh, if he didn't wanna die,
why was he doing the chalk outline?"</i>

<i>It's such a weird... How did they
even come up with zip-lining?</i>

<i>"Hey, you know how telephone
poles have a wire between 'em?"</i>

<i>"What if we just put the tourists
up there?"</i>

<i>"Why would tourists do that?"</i>

<i>"Don't know.
Why would they pay to swim with sharks?"</i>

<i>We did go snorkeling.</i>

<i>I wasn't worried for myself</i>

<i>'cause I figured sharks would look
at my legs and be like,</i>

<i>"Those can't be real."</i>

<i>"I'm not gonna bite into
another mannequin, that's for sure."</i>

<i>Sometimes, when my family
would go to the beach,</i>

<i>I'd go for a hike by myself,</i>

<i>which was boring,
but I figured how to make it fun.</i>

<i>I started bringing a ketchup packet,</i>

<i>and halfway through the hike,
I'd open up the ketchup packet</i>

<i>and rub it on my hands and my face,</i>

<i>then I'd just approach romantic couples.</i>

<i>"Have you seen my wife?"</i>

<i>"No."</i>

<i>"But you heard her
sassing off to me, right?"</i>

<i>"I can still smell her sin."</i>

<i>"Jim, that joke's scary."</i>

<i>"That's a scary joke."</i>

<i>The pandemic continues, but we'reâ€¦</i>

<i>we're also processing part
of the pandemic.</i>

<i>We went a year and a half
with no weddings,</i>

<i>no kids' birthday parties,
no family reunions,</i>

<i>but it wasn't all good news.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>Right? Huh?</i>

<i>Some things... I don't think
some things are coming back.</i>

<i>Like parades. I think that might
be a wrap on parades.</i>

<i>There was never anything
that impressive about a parade.</i>

<i>You're all like, "Hey, kids, look.
People areâ€¦ walking."</i>

<i>"Creating unnecessary traffic."</i>

<i>Before the pandemic,
if you ran into a parade,</i>

<i>you were never like,
"Oh, cool, a parade."</i>

<i>You were always kind of like,
"I hate humans."</i>

<i>The only people really
enjoying the parade</i>

<i>were the people marching in the parade.</i>

<i>Even the people on the sidewalk
were like, "How long is this?"</i>

<i>Of course, the highlight of most parades</i>

<i>is the marching band, right?</i>

<i>And on TV, that bird's-eye view
of the marching band</i>

<i>is so impressive, right?</i>

<i>But on a street level,
you always felt like</i>

<i>you were being invaded by nerds.</i>

<i>"Uh-oh. Here they come. Hide your Xbox."</i>

<i>But marching bands are amazing, right?</i>

<i>They practice as much as the athletes.</i>

<i>They're always rehearsing.</i>

<i>It's amazing how much effort goes
into creating something</i>

<i>that no one really likes.</i>

<i>I'm kidding.</i>

<i>I know there's some
marching band people here and itâ€¦</i>

<i>And then for those... You know, like...</i>

<i>The reality is,
a marching band can take a song...</i>

<i>It's pretty impressive... any song,</i>

<i>and ruin it.</i>

<i>You know, like, "Wow, I didn't know
I could hate 'Uptown Funk' that much."</i>

<i>You're never listening to a song
and think,</i>

<i>"I wish there was
a marching band version of this."</i>

<i>And I understand there's
some proud marching band people here.</i>

<i>And in full disclosure,
I could never be in a marching band</i>

<i>'cause I've had sex.</i>

<i>"He'sâ€¦ He's gonna get beat up
by a marching band."</i>

<i>No, I know that people cherish their
time in the marching band, they do.</i>

<i>But to me, it just seems like
we're dissuading careers in music.</i>

<i>It's like, "Oh, you wanna be
a musician? Okay."</i>

<i>"Put on this Captain Crunch costume."</i>

<i>"At halftime, march around the field
while we grab some hot dogs."</i>

<i>"Do that for a couple semesters,</i>

<i>then we'll see
if you still wanna be a musician."</i>

<i>Did you know that...? I didn't know this.
Marching bands started as military bands.</i>

<i>They would march armies into battle,</i>

<i>and they were for morale
and to intimidate the enemy.</i>

<i>I don't know how that would work.</i>

<i>"Oh, no. They know Fleetwood Mac."</i>

<i>"Should we go back?"</i>

<i>"What if Lindsey
Buckingham is with them?"</i>

<i>How did they convince someone
playing a trumpet to march into battleâ€¦</i>

<i>"Head on in there."</i>

<i>"Won't they have weapons?"</i>

<i>"You're gonna fight them with music."</i>

<i>"If you survive, please wake us up
in the morning with aâ€¦"</i>

<i>I love it when trumpet players
have the plunger at the end.</i>

<i>Who came up with that?</i>

<i>"You know, I was listening to you
play the trumpet</i>

<i>and it reminded me
of when I clogged my toilet."</i>

<i>"I'd eaten six Big Macs
on a dare, anyway."</i>

<i>"Uh, I brought my plunger.
It's kind of clean."</i>

<i>"If you could place it at the end
of your expensive music equipment,</i>

<i>and give me a 'wah-wah.'"</i>

<i>"Go ahead."</i>

<i>"Have you ever thought
of becoming a plumber?"</i>

<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

<i>People always know someone
who looks like me.</i>

<i>Wherever I go, once a week,
someone will come up to me and go,</i>

<i>"Hey, I know someone
that looks like you."</i>

<i>I never know what to say.
"Well, tell him 'Hi.'"</i>

<i>"Encourage them to wear sunscreen."</i>

<i>And this person who looks like me</i>

<i>never doing something impressive
with their life.</i>

<i>"Yeah, he mows our lawn."</i>

<i>"We don't even pay
him. He just does it."</i>

<i>That sounds like my gene pool.</i>

<i>Occasionally, on social media,
I'll be sent photos of babies</i>

<i>who supposedly look like me.</i>

<i>"This baby looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

<i>People think it's hysterical</i>

<i>that I look like a pale,
pudgy, bald infant</i>

<i>who poops in a diaper.</i>

<i>Sometimes, people get too cute.</i>

<i>They're like, "Hey, why does
our baby son look like Jim Gaffigan?"</i>

<i>I'm like, "'Cause I
slept with your wife."</i>

<i>Now if you think it's humiliating
to be told you look like a baby,</i>

<i>you should know I've also been
sent photos of cats that supposedlyâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦look like me.</i>

<i>Not once or twice, we're talking
about dozens of different cats.</i>

<i>Always the same message.</i>

<i>"This cat looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

<i>I don't know what they're implying,
you know.</i>

<i>That I fathered a cat out of wedlock?</i>

<i>When I was lonely after a show
so I went for a walk andâ€¦</i>

<i>an alley cat asked
for a cigarette andâ€¦</i>

<i>I said I don't smoke andâ€¦</i>

<i>well, we started talking andâ€¦</i>

<i>before you know it,
the sun was coming up.</i>

<i>I never saw that cat again.</i>

<i>I can still smell her dander.</i>

<i>Now, if you think it's humiliating</i>

<i>to be told you look
like a baby or a cat,</i>

<i>you should know I was once sent a photo
of someone's kneecapâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦with the message,
"This kneecap looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

<i>- And you know what?
I did look like that kneecap.</i>

<i>But I don't know
what they were implying, you know.</i>

<i>That I fathered a
kneecap out of wedlock?</i>

<i>That I was lonely after a show andâ€¦</i>

<i>I went for a walk and a kneecap asked
for a cigarette andâ€¦</i>

<i>and I said I don't smoke andâ€¦</i>

<i>we started talking.</i>

<i>Before you know it,
the sun was coming up.</i>

<i>I never saw that kneecap again.</i>

<i>Now, if you think it's humiliatingâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦to be told you look like the fleshy,
wrinkly part of a stranger's legâ€¦</i>

<i>it is.</i>

<i>Or, uh, you know, I thought it was.
And then I had this realization.</i>

<i>I figured out what had happened.</i>

<i>You know, it all made sense.</i>

<i>There might be one person in here
that's like, "Jim, you're crazy."</i>

<i>But I think the rest of you
will see the logic here.</i>

<i>What happened is, this kneecap person,
obviously, went to a plastic surgeonâ€¦</i>

<i>Right? And said, "I
would like my kneecap</i>

<i>to look like the most
underrated comedian in America."</i>

<i>Right? And the plastic surgeon said,</i>

<i>"You mean John Mulaney?"</i>

<i>And the kneecap person said,
"No, Jim Gaffigan."</i>

<i>And the plastic surgeon said,
"I don't know who that is."</i>

<i>And then the kneecap person said,</i>

<i>"He's kind of a pale, pudgy guy
who looks like a baby or a cat."</i>

<i>That's probably what happened.</i>

<i>That's weird.</i>

<i>I normally get told I look like
other humans though. I, uhâ€¦</i>

<i>In Utah, I always get
told I look Mormon.</i>

<i>I didn't even know
you could look like a religion.</i>

<i>But apparently, I do.
And I've done research.</i>

<i>I don't look like one of the founders
of the Mormons.</i>

<i>I don't look like a present leader
of the Mormons.</i>

<i>I don't even look like a guy
who could have more than one wife.</i>

<i>I just somehow look Mormon.</i>

<i>Of course, the Mormons
no longer practice polygamy.</i>

<i>But for a while there, a Mormon man
could have more than one wife.</i>

<i>I don't know if that
was a selling point.</i>

<i>'Cause I love my wife, and I can
honestly say I don't want another one.</i>

<i>I feel like disappointing one person
is enough.</i>

<i>Could you imagine
having two spouses mad at you?</i>

<i>And you couldn't drink coffee?</i>

<i>No, thanks.</i>

<i>I hope it doesn't sound like
I'm picking on Mormons.</i>

<i>Most organized religions
have negative stereotypes.</i>

<i>Luckily, I'm Catholic, so I don't have
to worry about that, all right.</i>

<i>Sometimes people don't believe me.
Like, "Are you really Catholic?"</i>

<i>"No, I'm just saying
that to impress you."</i>

<i>"I wanna come across like
I have good judgment."</i>

<i>At this point, it's almost like
Catholics are trying to lose followers.</i>

<i>They're like, "What else can we do?
What else?"</i>

<i>"Why don't we make Bill Cosby pope?
Let's try that."</i>

<i>Catholics have made an art
of shrinking their religion.</i>

<i>Even back to the Great Schism of 1054
where the Eastern Orthodox</i>

<i>and the Roman Catholics split apart,</i>

<i>the Orthodox were like, "We wanna
celebrate Christmas in January."</i>

<i>And the Catholics were like,
"We like pedophiles."</i>

<i>I know. That one's hard for me too.</i>

<i>And then there was
the, uh, Protestant Reformation.</i>

<i>You didn't even know this is a
religion history class, did you?</i>

<i>No, there was the Protestant Reformation
in the 1500s</i>

<i>when Martin Luther, who probably thought
he'd be the most famous Martin Lutherâ€¦</i>

<i>Right? He was like, "That's it.
I'm the king of Martin Luthers."</i>

<i>"Don't be surprised if one day,
I get my own holiday."</i>

<i>No, Martin Luther,
he had those 95 problems,</i>

<i>but a bitch ain't one, right?</i>

<i>'Cause at the time,
the Catholic church was super corrupt.</i>

<i>Thankfully, it's not anymore.</i>

<i>Some Catholics get really angry.</i>

<i>"You're so critical of Catholic church,
why you even Catholic?"</i>

<i>Because I believe human beings
are inherently flawed.</i>

<i>That's one of the reasons.</i>

<i>But mainly, I'm afraid of my wife.</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>I don't think there's anything
intrinsically wrong</i>

<i>with organized religion.</i>

<i>It's just the human
interpretation, right?</i>

<i>Most organized religions,
God's saying a similar thing.</i>

<i>He's like,
"I want you to love one another."</i>

<i>And the humans are like, "Got it,
got it. He said kill gay people, soâ€¦"</i>

<i>"Let's get to work."</i>

<i>As a result, all organized religions
are struggling right now.</i>

<i>Muslims, they're killing it.</i>

<i>Muslims are like, "Oh, Catholics,
you think you can alienate people?"</i>

<i>"Hold my hummus."</i>

<i>"Let me show you how it's done."</i>

<i>i'm sure some of you
are looking at me like,</i>

<i>"Hey, Jim, you look like
a former Hitler Youth."</i>

<i>"What are your views on Judaism?"</i>

<i>"I'd like to see you destroy
your career tonight."</i>

<i>Well, I'm not frightened.
I'll tell you what I think.</i>

<i>I think Judaism is perfect.</i>

<i>There's nothing wrong with it. And
I'd like to be in more feature films.</i>

<i>That'sâ€¦</i>

<i>That's some, uhâ€¦</i>

<i>That's some good old-fashioned
pandering anti-Semitism.</i>

<i>Really, the only organized religion,</i>

<i>without a negative stereotype,
is Buddhism.</i>

<i>Right? You'd think more Americans
would be Buddhists.</i>

<i>'Cause if you look at Buddha,
he kind of looks like an American.</i>

<i>Buddha looks like someone
you'd watch the game with.</i>

<i>"Buddha always gets
a keg for the playoffs."</i>

<i>"Buddha! Buddha!"</i>

<i>You know, in real life, Buddha was thin.
He wasn't even a big guy.</i>

<i>They made him heavy
to make the religion more appealing.</i>

<i>'Cause at that time,
being heavy was a sign of success.</i>

<i>Also at that time, being lighter-skinned
was a sign of success.</i>

<i>So back then,
I would have been like Jeff Bezos, soâ€¦</i>

<i>Bezos. Who's your favorite
billionaire-pretend astronaut?</i>

<i>Hmm?</i>

<i>Can you believe there's a choice?</i>

<i>And it's not between just two.</i>

<i>We live in a day when billionaires
are building their own rockets</i>

<i>to fly to outer space,
and no one's saying,</i>

<i>"Are you sure they're paying
all their taxes?"</i>

<i>"'Cause I know some teachers
that need supplies."</i>

<i>It's like these billionaires are trying
to execute the plan</i>

<i>of a five-year-old boy.</i>

<i>"When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a bazillionaire!"</i>

<i>"And I'm gonna build my own spaceship!"</i>

<i>"And fly to outer space!"</i>

<i>"Okay, Jeffrey."</i>

<i>"But now it's time for bed."</i>

<i>I almost feel sorry for the accountants
of the billionaires.</i>

<i>'Cause they were like,
"You had an amazing year."</i>

<i>"You made 40 billion dollars."</i>

<i>"But I fudged the numbers
so it looks like you broke even."</i>

<i>"As long as you lay low
and don't draw attention,</i>

<i>we should be fine."</i>

<i>"You got anything coming up?"</i>

<i>"I built a rocketâ€¦"</i>

<i>"â€¦to fly to outer space."</i>

<i>"You know I meant to lay low
on this planet."</i>

<i>"Does it matter
if the rocket's shaped like a penis?"</i>

<i>I do enjoy the reasoning
of the billionaires for going to space.</i>

<i>They're like, "I'm going to outer space
so eventually</i> you</i><i> can go to outer space."</i>

<i>"I'm going so you can go."</i>

<i>"I don't wanna go to outer space."</i>

<i>"I wanna go to Italy."</i>

<i>Why don't you work on that?</i>

<i>I saw a hitchhiker recently.
You never see that anymore.</i>

<i>Of course, we no longer
refer to them as "hitchhikers."</i>

<i>Now we call them "murderers".</i>

<i>Which is what they do. They murder
the nice people that give them rides.</i>

<i>Talk about a lack of gratitude.</i>

<i>"Thanks for picking me up." Stab.</i>

<i>Hitchhiking disappeared 'cause
it was dangerous for both participants.</i>

<i>Right? The hitchhiker and the driver.</i>

<i>And, you know, at one point,
there must have been like</i>

<i>a murderer driving around
looking to pick up a hitchhiker,</i>

<i>and he picked up a hitchhiker
who was also a murderer.</i>

<i>And the driver was like,
"I'm gonna kill you."</i>

<i>And the hitchhiker was like,
"I'm gonna kill you."</i>

<i>And I bet they had a laugh.</i>

<i>I bet they laughed.</i>

<i>And then slowly but surely,
"they fell in love."</i>

<i>"And that's what my musical's about."</i>

<i>It's called Hitched.</i>

<i>Flew in Thursday,
uh, driving from the airport,</i>

<i>I saw this guy on a motorcycle
and he looked so happy.</i>

<i>You know, and whenever I see a
motorcycle that's on the highway,</i>

<i>I always have the same thought.</i>

<i>"You're gonna die."</i>

<i>"What are you doing on the highway?
You're gonna die."</i>

<i>And the only reason I say that
is 'cause they're gonna die.</i>

<i>I don't even know what the thinking is.</i>

<i>"Well, I have to
travel a long distance."</i>

<i>"Should I take the car or this
motorized chair with no seat belt?"</i>

<i>"If I sneeze, I'll never walk again."</i>

<i>"Live to ride."</i>

<i>And then die!</i>

<i>I heard the motorcycle before I saw it.
We've all heard those loud motorcycles.</i>

<i>"Wow, how small is his penis?"</i>

<i>And I didn't know that's the reason
some motorcycles are so loud</i>

<i>is 'cause they want you to know
they're gonna die.</i>

<i>I have friends that love motorcycles.</i>

<i>Some women are really into bikers.</i>

<i>They're like,
"I just like a man who's dangerous,</i>

<i>who can't afford a car."</i>

<i>"And who's definitely gonna die."</i>

<i>But bikers are fascinating, right?</i>

<i>What a uniquely American subculture.</i>

<i>They're all about macho
independence, right?</i>

<i>They're all about the independence.
Like, "I just wanna be out on the road,</i>

<i>just me and my bike, alone,</i>

<i>with 30 other guys."</i>

<i>"In matching outfits."</i>

<i>"Riding in tandem so close,
we can French-kiss each other."</i>

<i>He's gonna get beat up by a
marching band and a gang of bikers.</i>

<i>Bikers are grown men who make the same
phone calls of an eight-year-old boy.</i>

<i>"You guys wanna ride bikes tonight?"</i>

<i>"Well, I don't wanna go alone.
It's scary out there. Ask your mommy."</i>

<i>The reason that's funny is 'cause bikers
are so intimidating, right?</i>

<i>They're angry.</i>

<i>Bikers seem angry,
and I think it's 'cause they're cold.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>That vest with no shirt?
That's gotta be chilly.</i>

<i>"Oh, I wish I had a shawl."</i>

<i>"Shawl and my Uggs."</i>

<i>"Maybe a pumpkin spice latte."</i>

<i>That vest with no shirt is so common
among bikers.</i>

<i>Is there like peer pressure?</i>

<i>"Look at Curtis over there,</i>

<i>wearing a T-shirt under his vest
like a girl."</i>

<i>"Let's kick his ass."</i>

<i>"And then kiss him."</i>

<i>Occasionally, you'll see a biker
giving someone a ride</i>

<i>on the back of their motorcycle,
it's usually a woman.</i>

<i>Guys don't wanna ride on the back. Mm.</i>

<i>It's hard to get a ride
on the back of a motorcycle</i>

<i>without giving an extended intimate hug.</i>

<i>"Let's get out of here, Virgil."</i>

<i>"You smell wonderful, Virgil."</i>

<i>"What is that, lilac?"</i>

<i>"You've been doing sit-ups, Virgil?"</i>

<i>During the summer, occasionally,
you'll see a bicyclist on the highway.</i>

<i>See a cyclist on the highway,</i>

<i>they're always dressed like they're
competing in the </i>Tour de France</i><i>.</i>

<i>"You're losing!"</i>

<i>"And you're also gonna die."</i>

<i>Those bicyclists, they have to
settle down with the helmet design.</i>

<i>It's all super aerodynamic.
It's like, "You're not going that fast."</i>

<i>You're riding a bike. You're not in
the movie </i>Tron</i><i>.</i>

<i>And put on some clothes!</i>

<i>What's with the spandex?</i>

<i>Are you on your way
to wrestle Blue Man Group?</i>

<i>How many Blue Man references
you're gonna have?</i>

<i>You ever see a bicyclist on the highway
and they're not in spandex,</i>

<i>they're just in regular clothes?</i>

<i>They look like they have a DUI.</i>

<i>Should've Ubered.</i>

<i>You never see a cyclist
giving someone a ride, right?</i>

<i>There's no room.</i>

<i>They're already sitting
on that door handle of a seat.</i>

<i>"I'm just gonna sit
here for five hours."</i>

<i>"I don't know why I
can't have children."</i>

<i>Right, I'm going after the cyclist.</i>

<i>What are they gonna do?
Throw their baby bottle of water at me?</i>

<i>"I'd chase you, but for no reason
at all, I'm wearing cleats."</i>

<i>Are those cleats necessary?</i>

<i>You're in a Starbucks.</i>

<i>"Do you have oat milk?"</i>

<i>I think it's interesting, people who
ride bicycles are called "cyclists,"</i>

<i>but people who ride motorcycles
are called "bikers"?</i>

<i>You know, that's just the bikers
bullying the cyclists.</i>

<i>"Hey, we're gonna take the name 'biker.'
You can't use it."</i>

<i>And the cyclist went, "Motorcycle
doesn't even have the word 'bike' in it."</i>

<i>"We don't care."</i>

<i>"Also, we're gonna dress like that guy
from the Village People."</i>

<i>Sun-glass guy's like,
"Well, we were gonna do that."</i>

<i>"No, you're gonna dress like
rhythmic gymnasts."</i>

<i>"Okay."</i>

<i>Bikers and cyclists both dress like
they're on their way to a costume party.</i>

<i>No other form of transportation
has a uniform.</i>

<i>You never see everyone on
the cruise ship dress like pirates</i>

<i>'cause it's not necessary.</i>

<i>Bikers and cyclists, both on two wheels,
nothing in common.</i>

<i>It's like they're
trying to be different.</i>

<i>Even the placement of the handlebarsâ€¦</i>

<i>Some cyclists
have handlebars in real tight,</i>

<i>some bikers have their handlebars
way up here.</i>

<i>"Oh, this is comfortable."</i>

<i>"This reminds me of my Big Wheel."</i>

<i>"Now I know why I have
my wallet on a chain."</i>

<i>You never see a
unicyclist on the highway.</i>

<i>You know why? 'Cause they're all dead.</i>

<i>'Cause I killed them. You're welcome.</i>

<i>Is there any bigger attention-grab
than riding a unicycle?</i>

<i>I guess a pogo stick, right?</i>

<i>What was the pitch for the pogo stick?</i>

<i>"It's a stick you can jump on twice
and then fall on your face."</i>

<i>"Interesting. If you practice,
do you get better?"</i>

<i>"Not at all, no."</i>

<i>"I'll take one."</i>

<i>But unicyclists, they act like
they don't want the attention.</i>

<i>They always have that super casual look
on their face,</i>

<i>but their legs are so frantic.</i>

<i>They're always likeâ€¦</i>

<i>"Oh, hey, what's going on, everyone?"</i>

<i>"Oh, I'm not doing anything."</i>

<i>"Does anyone have three bowling pins
I could juggle?"</i>

<i>"I could annoy you
with two unnecessary skills."</i>

<i>That joke takes way too much effort.</i>

<i>Oh, you may have noticed
that there's a piano on stage.</i>

<i>And, uh, some of you may be wondering,</i>

<i>"Hey, why would Jim Gaffigan
have a piano on stage?"</i>

<i>Andâ€¦</i>

<i>What you may not realize is that Iâ€¦</i>

<i>do not play the piano.</i>

<i>"Jim, that wasâ€¦"</i>

<i>"Really? Did he bring the piano
just for that joke?"</i>

<i>"That's pathetic."</i>

<i>Good-looking crowd here. Wow.</i>

<i>Very good-looking.</i>

<i>Very good-looking crowd, huh?</i>

<i>Well, not all of you, you know.</i>

<i>Not all of you.</i>

<i>But I'm not breaking any news, right?
We know where we stand.</i>

<i>Yeah, we learn from such an early age.</i>

<i>Like, I remember kindergarten, the girls
would chase the cute boys at recess,</i>

<i>and let's just say I didn't do
a lot of running.</i>

<i>Or any running.</i>

<i>I remember being five
years old and going,</i>

<i>"Oh, this is how it's gonna be."</i>

<i>"I'm gonna have to write some jokes."</i>

<i>"And I'll be hanging
out with the fellas."</i>

<i>I still hang out with the fellas.</i>

<i>All right, I had a friend
during the lockdown</i>

<i>who spent the entire time
planning a guys' weekend.</i>

<i>Every time I talk to him, he
would make it sound less appealing.</i>

<i>"Dude, this is what we're gonna do."</i>

<i>"We're gonna rent a cabin for
the weekend. Just guys, no women."</i>

<i>"I'm already out."</i>

<i>"No, no, no. Think about it.
Just guys, no women."</i>

<i>"We'll smoke cigars,
play poker all weekend."</i>

<i>"Sounds horrible."</i>

<i>"You're not thinking it through."</i>

<i>"Just guys, no women, for a
whole weekend, like we're in prison."</i>

<i>"I look forward to it."</i>

<i>Every year, my brother Mitch
goes on a golfing trip with 30 men.</i>

<i>Thirty men. They fly to Florida.</i>

<i>They rent three houses.
Ten men to a house.</i>

<i>They play golf in the morning,
they eat lunch together,</i>

<i>they play golf in the afternoon,
and then they go back to the houses,</i>

<i>I don't know, have sex with each other.</i>

<i>I don't know what they do.
It sounds horrible.</i>

<i>How much fellowship can you have?</i>

<i>My brother is not gay and,
obviously, I wouldn't care if he was.</i>

<i>But if he ever came out, he could be
like, "I gave you so many hints."</i>

<i>"I literally vacationed with 30 men."</i>

<i>"We rented out a cul-de-sac."</i>

<i>"We played with
sticks and balls all day."</i>

<i>"How clear did I have to make it?"</i>

<i>I guess the point I'm trying to make
is golf makes people gay.</i>

<i>Soâ€¦</i>

<i>So the next time a friend says,</i>

<i>"I'm going to play golf with
the fellas," just be like, "Enjoy."</i>

<i>No, I prefer mixed company.
I do, you know.</i>

<i>There's a clichÃ© that men are dumb</i>

<i>and I have enough male friends
to know that's based on some truth.</i>

<i>Every man in here has that friend</i>

<i>that they occasionally look at
and wonder how they hold down a job.</i>

<i>And if you don't think that about
a friend, that means you're the friend.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>My friend like that is Ricky.
He's a great guy.</i>

<i>Ricky and I, one time,
we went axe-throwing.</i>

<i>Don't know if you've done that.
Throw an axe, you drink a beer.</i>

<i>You try and forget
our democracy is in crisis andâ€¦</i>

<i>At one point,
Ricky turned to me and he goes,</i>

<i>"Hey, before axe-throwing,
what did they use axes for?"</i>

<i>"Uhâ€¦"</i>

<i>"Chopping wood?"</i>

<i>He's like, "Really?"
And I was like, "Don't talk anymore."</i>

<i>And like a good friend, I ran home,
turned it into a stand-up bit.</i>

<i>And I kind of forgot about it.</i>

<i>Then, like a month later, Ricky
called me out of the blue and goes,</i>

<i>"I did it. I did it."</i>

<i>"I built my own axe-throwing range
in my backyard."</i>

<i>Yeah, he's divorced.</i>

<i>Andâ€¦</i>

<i>Then he immediately starts bragging.</i>

<i>He's like, "Yeah, now, I could throw
an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye."</i>

<i>I'm like, "That's impressive."</i>

<i>"You know when that's
gonna come in handy? Never."</i>

<i>He'll be like, "Hey, you never know."
I'm like, "No, I do know."</i>

<i>Even if someone broke in your house
and you happen to be holding an axe,</i>

<i>you're not gonna be able to say,
"Hey, can you come 10 feet closer?"</i>

<i>I like having women around
for many reasons,</i>

<i>not least of which is,
they're attractive and men are not.</i>

<i>You know?</i>

<i>Like when a guy's good-looking,
it's like a fluke of nature.</i>

<i>And you know what
all attractive men have in common?</i>

<i>They kind of look like women.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>That's the only way straight
guys can tell who's good-looking.</i>

<i>"Wow, he must be attractive.
He barely looks like a dude."</i>

<i>Women are attractive
and compared to men, they're very clean.</i>

<i>Men are gross.</i>

<i>And make very little effort
to not be gross.</i>

<i>Like, if aliens visited Earth,
they'll be so confused.</i>

<i>They'll be like, "The attractive
feminine gender is taking</i>

<i>an hour to get ready
and those hairy beasts are just ready?"</i>

<i>"No wonder this planet's always at war."</i>

<i>Men are gross
and as they get older, grosser.</i>

<i>When women get older,
they become more elegant.</i>

<i>As men get older,
they look like they're decomposing.</i>

<i>You ever seen an old guy
with the shirt off?</i>

<i>He looks like the
first draft of a human.</i>

<i>What is that, a </i>Simpsons</i><i> character?</i>

<i>Because when men get older,
things stop working.</i>

<i>The synapses stop connecting.</i>

<i>Normally, brain's like, "Every month,
I'm gonna grow hair on this guy's head.</i>

<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair
on this guy's head."</i>

<i>But one month, the brain's like,</i>

<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair
everywhere but this guy's head."</i>

<i>I have hair growing in parts of my bodyâ€¦</i>

<i>I don't need.</i>

<i>Do you wanna know why older men
grow hair on weird parts of their body?</i>

<i>That's nature's way of saying,
"You're done."</i>

<i>"Stop mating or I'm going to turn you
into a throw rug."</i>

<i>I have some body hair, not as
bad as some men, which is a relief,</i>

<i>'cause as you can see,
I did not win the genetic lottery.</i>

<i>I am bald, blind and pale.</i>

<i>It wouldn't surprise me
if I woke up tomorrow with a tail.</i>

<i>"Have you seen the comic with the tail?"</i>

<i>"He's very pale
and the tail even has a bald spot."</i>

<i>I saw a guy this summer at the pool,
he's probably 60, had his shirt off.</i>

<i>Not a lot of body hair. All body hair.</i>

<i>For a second, I thought they were
shooting a GEICO commercial.</i>

<i>This guy was...</i>

<i>He was so hairy I had to stop
my youngest son from trying to pet him.</i>

<i>"Let him smell your hand first, son."</i>

<i>This guy was hairy and he was walking
around the pool with the confidence</i>

<i>like he'd spent a lifetime dealing
with hairy situations.</i>

<i>No one said anything,
but everyone had the same thought:</i>

<i>"Please don't go in the pool."</i>

<i>"No one's prepared
to see you shake dry."</i>

<i>And this man walked right by everyone,</i>

<i>and he sat down next
to an attractive woman.</i>

<i>And I was so impressed.</i>

<i>That woman could look beyond this man's
appearance and focus solely on his wallet.</i>

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>But we all wanna be good-looking, right?</i>

<i>We all wanna be chased
on the playground, right?</i>

<i>Some people go so far
as to get plastic surgery.</i>

<i>They're like,
"Oh, I don't wanna sound desperate,</i>

<i>but can you take a knife to my face?"</i>

<i>"And make me pretty.
Just keep cutting!"</i>

<i>It's kind of amazing more of us
don't get plastic surgery</i>

<i>because we live in
a beauty-obsessed society, right?</i>

<i>There are studies.
There was a Harvard study,</i>

<i>that found that children believed
good-looking people are nicer.</i>

<i>That study also found
that children are stupid.</i>

<i>We definitely give good-looking people
the benefit of the doubt.</i>

<i>Like if a really attractive
person's quiet,</i>

<i>we think they're mysterious.</i>

<i>If a fat person is quiet, we assume
they're thinking about food.</i>

<i>And we are, we are,
but there's still a mystery.</i>

<i>You don't know what kind of food.</i>

<i>All right, it's cake. It's always cake.</i>

<i>But you don't know what kind.
All right, it's red velvet.</i>

<i>As a result, we just like being
around beautiful people.</i>

<i>You ever been out to eat</i>

<i>and you have a waiter or waitress
that's really attractive?</i>

<i>For a second, you're like,
"Wow, this is gonna be a good meal."</i>

<i>You ever have an ugly waiter,
you're like, "Should we leave?"</i>

<i>I think that's why buffets started.</i>

<i>"You know what, I'll get my own food.
Thank you."</i>

<i>"I don't need that mug near my entrÃ©e.
You know what I mean?"</i>

<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

<i>We follow good-looking people
on social media, Instagram.</i>

<i>Beautiful people have
millions of followers</i>

<i>and we like their photos
and sometimes, we put a flame emoji.</i>

<i>It's totally socially acceptable.</i>

<i>If you did that in real life,
you'd go to jail.</i>

<i>"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?"</i>

<i>"I'm following that lady."</i>

<i>"Uh, Can I ask why?"
"I like to look at her."</i>

<i>"Can you give her this torch
I brought her?"</i>

<i>"And these prayer hands."</i>

<i>Everyone's got to settle down
with the prayer hands emoji.</i>

<i>The overuse is ridiculous.</i>

<i>Got a text from a friend,
"See you at dinner. Prayer hands."</i>

<i>"No. No prayer hands.
Are you not gonna make it?"</i>

<i>"What are you suggesting?
That we eat hands for dinner?"</i>

<i>My wife is very good-looking.</i>

<i>That's right, I'm part
of a mixed couple.</i>

<i>It's not fair. She's good-looking,</i>

<i>she's smart, she's creative.
But you know what?</i>

<i>Horrible taste in men.</i>

<i>So it evens out. I'm happily married,</i>

<i>but I would say, once a week,
I catch my wife giving me a look, like,</i>

<i>"I'm gonna have to let you go."</i>

<i>'Cause I disappoint her constantly.</i>

<i>I do things that annoy.</i>

<i>Like, here's something I do
that annoys my wife.</i>

<i>I use the bathroom.</i>

<i>I know. I shouldn't, right?</i>

<i>I get in trouble for not telling her
I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

<i>"You just disappeared. Where'd you go?"</i>

<i>"I didn't know I needed a hall pass."</i>

<i>I also get in trouble for telling her
I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

<i>"Uh, I'm gonna use the bathroom."</i>

<i>"Again?"</i>

<i>"Are you okay?"</i>

<i>"How many times is that today?"</i>

<i>"You're disgusting."</i>

<i>"What do you do in there?"</i>

<i>"Mostly get away from you."</i>

<i>When my wife's annoyed with me, she
doesn't give me the silent treatment.</i>

<i>She'll just take too long
to answer a simple question.</i>

<i>She'll be standing a foot away,
looking at her phone and I'll be like,</i>

<i>"What time do we have to do that
school thing?" And she'll just be likeâ€¦</i>

<i>"It's in the calendar."</i>

<i>I'll be like, "Uh, are you mad at me?"</i>

<i>"No."</i>

<i>Recently, we learned that this couple that
we're friends with are getting a divorce.</i>

<i>And not surprisingly,
my wife was very upset.</i>

<i>With me.</i>

<i>I wasn't surprised
'cause this wasn't the first time</i>

<i>something I had nothing to do with
was my fault.</i>

<i>Trump's election, the Kavanaugh
hearings, that was my fault.</i>

<i>And I apologize 'cause
I unconsciously planned the whole thing.</i>

<i>Now, I would never describe my wife
as crazy, 'cause I like to be married.</i>

<i>But I do think it's interesting</i>

<i>that if a man calls another man crazy,
it's a compliment.</i>

<i>"Here's my buddy, Joey. He's crazy."</i>

<i>Joey's like, "Oh,
you're just being nice."</i>

<i>But if I was like,
"This is my wife, Jeannie. She's crazy."</i>

<i>I even get nervous saying that.</i>

<i>She's back in New York,
but you never know.</i>

<i>'Cause if my wife was standing here</i>

<i>and I was like,
"This is my wife, she's crazy,"</i>

<i>I'd be dead.</i>

<i>And all of you would applaud.</i>

<i>You'd be like, "Well, that was
a teachable moment. Yeah."</i>

<i>"We learned something."</i>

<i>No, we're hanging in there.</i>

<i>By the way,
if at the start of the pandemic,</i>

<i>you were in a relationship</i>

<i>and you're still in that relationship,
you should get money, right?</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>Because before the pandemic,</i>

<i>if you'd hear of a couple splitting up,
you were like, "Oh, no."</i>

<i>But during the pandemic,
when you'd hear of a break up,</i>

<i>you're like, "Oh, of course."</i>

<i>You felt for the couples
that stayed together.</i>

<i>"You're still together?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."</i>

<i>"Co-dependency, huh?"</i>

<i>'Cause it doesn't matter
how strong your relationship was.</i>

<i>At one point during the pandemic,</i>

<i>you looked at your partner and thought,
"I think I'd rather have the coronavirus."</i>

<i>I know that sounds horrible,
but it's true.</i>

<i>Everyone had that moment
where they're like,</i>

<i>"You know, how uncomfortable
is that ventilator?"</i>

<i>"I know I wouldn't be able to talk,</i>

<i>but does that mean
I wouldn't be able to hear her?"</i>

<i>"Do they have a ventilator
just for the ears?"</i>

<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

<i>My wife's an amazing mother.</i>

<i>We have five children.
Can you believe that?</i>

<i>Five children. Thank you.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>It is something I regretâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦'cause there's too many of them.</i>

<i>There's way too many.</i>

<i>Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend
I'm hosting a reality showâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦called </i>So You Think</i>
You're Going To College.</i>

<i>'Cause they all can't go.</i>

<i>They all can't go,
not if I'm getting that boat.</i>

<i>I'm kidding.
Obviously, I'm not getting the boatâ€¦</i>

<i>not until I get a motorcycle, you know.</i>

<i>My kids find me annoying.</i>

<i>All children find their
parents annoying,</i>

<i>which is kind of ironic, given children
essentially ruined their parents' lives.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>Parents give their children their time,</i>

<i>their energy and their money,</i>

<i>and we repay our
parents with resentment.</i>

<i>Have you ever seen an adult get
a phone call from one of their parents?</i>

<i>You'd think it was a debt collector.</i>

<i>"Ugh. It's my mom."</i>

<i>"Yeah, I know you took care of me
for a quarter of a century,</i>

<i>but now is not a good time."</i>

<i>"You know what wasn't a good time?
Giving up my dreamsâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦so you could be
a general disappointment."</i>

<i>No, I would never suggest that children
are God's punishment for having sex.</i>

<i>But an argument could be made.</i>

<i>And he's up there, "Oh, they're
enjoying that way too much."</i>

<i>"How can I get them to pray tomorrow?"</i>

<i>I do love being a parent. It's the most
important thing I'll do in my life.</i>

<i>But it's an insane proposition.</i>

<i>You give your children everything.</i>

<i>You give them everything
and then just one day, they leave.</i>

<i>They're like,
"See you! Thanks for nothing."</i>

<i>"I'll let you know if I need help
with a mortgage."</i>

<i>Sometimes they don't leave, right?</i>

<i>They just stick around.
They turn into roommates.</i>

<i>Not going to happen in my house.</i>

<i>I already have a backpack
for each of them.</i>

<i>They've seen the bags, "What's that?"</i>

<i>I'm like, "When you turn 18,
that's your going-away present."</i>

<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

<i>I try to be a good dad.</i>

<i>I feel like I make more of an effort
than my father.</i>

<i>My dad's generation,
they didn't have to do anything.</i>

<i>My dad never went
to a parent-teacher conference.</i>

<i>My dad didn't even
know I went to school.</i>

<i>My father couldn't be bothered
to turn his head</i>

<i>if something was happening behind him.</i>

<i>"What the hell's going on back there?"</i>

<i>I don't know if he
couldn't turn his head</i>

<i>or if it wasn't worth the effort.</i>

<i>"What the hell is going on back there?"</i>

<i>"Oh, we're celebrating my birthday."</i>

<i>"Oh, keep it down. I'm watching</i>
Ironsides.</i><i>"</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To you â™ª</i>

<i>My children give me guilt trips
I wouldn't even contemplate.</i>

<i>Like my daughter was in a play
on Thursday and Friday,</i>

<i>so I went on Thursday night
and then Friday morning,</i>

<i>she saw me with my rolly bag
and was like,</i>

<i>"Oh, you're not coming
to my show tonight?"</i>

<i>I'm like, "You've never been
to one of my shows."</i>

<i>"I do 300 a year."</i>

<i>My big plan</i>

<i>was to teach my children responsibility
by selling posters after one of my shows.</i>

<i>So I texted my teenage
daughter. I'm like,</i>

<i>"Do you wanna sell posters
after my show? I'll pay you."</i>

<i>She texted back, "Great, sounds good."</i>

<i>Then I texted my teenage son.</i>

<i>"Do you want to sell posters
after my show? I'll pay you."</i>

<i>He texted back, "No thanks.
I don't need the money."</i>

<i>He doesn't have any money.</i>

<i>He has my money.</i>

<i>I just texted back,
"You're out of the will."</i>

<i>I'm kidding. He was never in it.</i>

<i>If my father asked me to do something,</i>

<i>he wouldn't even stick around
for an answer.</i>

<i>"You wanna shovel the driveway?"
Then he'd just leave.</i>

<i>It was understood I was gonna shovel
the driveway or move out.</i>

<i>I was kind of frightened of my dad.</i>

<i>My children treat me like some bank
teller they reluctantly have to deal with.</i>

<i>Once a week,
they just appear in front of me.</i>

<i>"Hmmâ€¦ Mom said I could get a sharkâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦so I guess I need your credit card."</i>

<i>I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
"He's yelling again, Mom!"</i>

<i>If my dad was in a room in the house,
I wouldn't go to that side of the house.</i>

<i>"I'll just pee outside."</i>

<i>And I had all these older siblings that
used to send me in there to ask questions.</i>

<i>"Go ask Dad if we can
go to Dairy Queen."</i>

<i>"I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it."</i>

<i>"Go. You're too young to kill."</i>

<i>"Dad?"
"What the hell do you want?"</i>

<i>"He said, no."</i>

<i>When I didn't have kids,
I didn't understand my dad at all.</i>

<i>By the way, if you don't have children,
none of this should make sense.</i>

<i>Or even the concept of a Saturday night.</i>

<i>When you don't have kids,
you're like, "Saturday!"</i>

<i>And when you're a parent, you're like,
"Who can we pay to come to this houseâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦and watch this child?"</i>

<i>And your standards drop so dramatically.</i>

<i>Initially, like, "They
should have a PhD."</i>

<i>And then you're like,
"Well, how long were they in jail?"</i>

<i>"Murder? It wasn't children, right?"</i>

<i>"A Satanist? You'll fit right in."</i>

<i>Any parent will tell you that, like,
having children has enriched their lives.</i>

<i>It's exposed them to things
they never thought they'd do.</i>

<i>Like kids just... You end up doing
things you never thought you'd do.</i>

<i>Like for me, going outside.</i>

<i>You ever go outside with real little kids?
You don't even know what to do with them.</i>

<i>You're like,
"Well, I normally just drink out here."</i>

<i>"Who wants to play a game of nap?"</i>

<i>It's weird when your kids have
a friend that you're not a fan of.</i>

<i>"Oh, Tommy's coming over?
Well, I'll be leaving."</i>

<i>"You can text me when Tommy is goneâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦'cause he's immature."</i>

<i>I wasn't prepared
for all the activities kids have.</i>

<i>You pick up your kid and bring them to
an activity, then to another activity.</i>

<i>And if they don't have an activity,</i>

<i>you have to think of one,
or they'll smoke meth.</i>

<i>You're always looking
for an activity as a parent.</i>

<i>I took my kids to Ripley's Believe It or
Not.</i>

<i>I don't know if you've ever been
that desperate for something to do.</i>

<i>What can I tell you about Ripley's Believe It or
Not?</i>

<i>It's mostly not.</i>

<i>It's not interesting.
It's not even a lot of stuff.</i>

<i>It's like they just emptied out
some drifter's storage unit.</i>

<i>I do admire that
business model, you know.</i>

<i>Most businesses attempt
to establish trust with the customer.</i>

<i>Not Ripley's.</i>

<i>Like, "Believe itâ€¦ or not.
We don't care."</i>

<i>"We know you're not coming back."</i>

<i>I'm still getting used
to having teenagers.</i>

<i>Recently, my 17-year-old daughter
told me that she wants to be an actor,</i>

<i>which is so crazy
'cause when I was that age,</i>

<i>that movie Dead Poets Society  came out,</i>

<i>which is an amazing movie
with Robin Williams,</i>

<i>where he plays this teacher who inspires
these students to seize the day, right?</i>

<i>And one of the students wants
to be an actor.</i>

<i>And, you know, he joins the play
and he invites his dad to see the play</i>

<i>and after the play, he tells his dad
that he wants to be an actor.</i>

<i>Dad's like, "You're not gonna be an actor,
that's stupid. Waste of time and moneyâ€¦"</i>

<i>The kid's so distraught
he kills himself,</i>

<i>and then the teacher gets fired
and all the kids stand on desksâ€¦</i>

<i>Anyway, it's a great movie.</i>

<i>No, nowâ€¦ now that I'm the parent
of a teenager,</i>

<i>I realized that dad in </i>Dead Poets Society</i><i> was
right.</i>

<i>I'm kidding. I know the point
of the movie is, "Don't be a teacher."</i>

<i>My wife hates that joke so much.</i>

<i>My kids, I don't know what they think.</i>

<i>I don't even think my kids know
what I do for a living.</i>

<i>Or I should say I didn't think
they knew what I did for a living</i>

<i>till last Halloween.</i>

<i>My 10-year-old, Michael, didn't know
what he wanted to be for Halloween,</i>

<i>which is a crisis.</i>

<i>If you're a parent, you know this.</i>

<i>Then, like, two days before Halloween,
he ran up to me and he goes,</i>

<i>"I know what I'm gonna be for
Halloween."</i>

<i>"I'm gonna be a stand-up comedian."</i>

<i>And I was so touched.</i>

<i>I was like, "Oh, my gosh, for Halloween,
you wanna be your dad."</i>

<i>And he goes,
"No, I wanna be John Mulaney."</i>

<i>Slap! Right across the face.</i>

<i>Thank you so much, you guys.</i>

<i>Appreciate it.</i>

<i>That's Mom and Dad.</i>
