Yes, Yuko

Nowjust get down from the bus

Where do you want to go

I got it, OK

Got it? Where?

Let's go shopping together

What do you want to buy

We must have juice and candy

But they are waiting
It's alright

Come on This...

What

No

What's up

I can't move

I can't go inside

Are you alright? Come on

No

No

Cursed

Welcome

How are you

Welcome

I am not a customer

I've made an appointment with your boss

Excuse me, where is Mr. Kitaura

He is in the office

I'm Ryoko in OK Mark

I want to see Mr. Kitaura Okay

You are too late

I've already waited for 30 minutes

It is ordinary

for small shopkeepers like us to wait

for people from big companies like you

Not such thing

The appointment should be at 2 o'clock

What's the point of standing there

Not even want to say 'Welcome'

Welcome

What

Do you want to persuade us to join your group

If you agree to join our group,

I promise to report it

to Mr. Tejima

Tejima? That good guy

How is that guy

He promised to visit us

when our store opens

He had an accident

Accident?

Did he die?

Not yet, but he was seriously wounded

How is it?

His legs are in great pain

How painful is it

Does it need to cut off the legs

Already cut off

It's two legs

Have both shanks been cut off

It's really serious

Did you hear that

Both shanks have been cut off

Then he can't walk anymore

Don't bother me

I'm watching closely on that part-time worker

If I pay less attention,

that girl

will take away the money

Can he still walk?

The situation...

How is it
Tell me quickly

Did he urinate on the bed

Is he in great pain
Does he look miserable

Please tell me

Let's go back to the merchandise

The sales volume of our goods

has been quite good

So I really don't want

to change the agent

If something wrong arises,

I think your company will not

help my small shop

Tejima had already told me

For your worriness,

that's why I come here today

I come here to explain to you in details

What's the point of explaining

All is the damn shit of your company

That stupid thing had already explained

That stupid thing?

That guy without shanks

He had already explained to us

Will you go?

Not yet

Your boss wants me to take stock

What a bad luck

Our headquarters will probably blame me

Excuse me, you are...

I am a part-time worker. My name is Nori

I only worked here for about a month

My name is Ryoko

I'm the staff of OK Mark

Does OK Mark want this shop

Yes

I want to persuade the owner
to join our group

It sounds good

Something like chargers of the
mobile phones can be put here

People can also draw money here

Customers usually don't come here

There are many reasons for this

It's better for the lights here

to be brighter

It's really a bit dark

I usually have a sort of
uncomfortable feeling

I have to go to the warehouse to take the stock

Try to finish it within three days

I will try my best

This shop really gives me a strange feeling

Mr. Kitaura?

Welcome

Welcome

Wait a minute

666 yen please, sir

It doesn't have any custormer here

Do you know why the people nearby

do not come to this shop

That's why I guess

here is still in stock

This thing has already
out of stock in other places

Understand

Excuse me Yes

I got 1000 yen from you, sir

Now give back 334 yen to you

Thank you

Than you for coming

Pick it up

Pick it up

Who

Pick it up

Thank you
Thank you very much

Good morning, Mr. Kitaura

How is it going

Stock-taking will probably
be finished within this week

Believe me

Something strange is around here

Can't you feel it

Yes

My aunt also told not to do part-time work

Does only Miss. Nori work here?

Only me and Omori who works on night shift

Do you think there are ghosts here

Because I always think that
I am watched by somebody

The shopkeeper and his wife are also strange

So I have to finish stock-taking
as soon as possible

If we are able to purchase this shop,

it will definitely look different

When all the lights are changed,

many customers would come

Then I won't find other part-time job

and wait for your good news

The pay would also be better

I will have it reviewed

I go to work then Okay

What is it

Excuse me

Could you please explain it

The expiry date of this food
was three years ago

It has already expired

Why do you still keep it in the warehouse

This kind of goods cannot be regarded

as the assets of the shop

Yes, Mr. Kitaura

Are you sick

Sick?

Are you feeling sick

What are you talking about

This lady is really strange

Just ignore her

Are you alright

What do you mean

I think it is you who have
problems with your mind

Please be quiet

This is my goods

Don't take it, you thief

You are too much, Mr. Kitaura

The goods has already expired

What's the matter

Look over there

What

It rushed to the glass

You go back first

Let me clean up the mess

Miss. Ryoko

You have just said that here is strange

Is it true
Not such thing, don't worry

If it really does,

Nori will also...

What will happen to me...

It would be alright

In OK Mark,

it needs clever girls like you so much

This shop will change

You have to try your best to change this shop

Okay, please go

Please don't stop me

What do you want

I want to clean up the filth

Honey
You have to clean it without a single mark

I got it, honey

Thank you

You are early today

Should we now change shifts

It is gloomy outside

Please go

Thank you. I go now

I'm coming

You should not have time to buy food to eat

I buy it for you

I would be in trouble if somebody has found out

I pay it myself. What is to be afraid of

Thank you

I have to go now, bye

Only ghosts have no leg

Hateful, hateful

What a beautiful store-assistant

Very cold

You have a message

Okay

I would go there later

You wait for me there first

I long for your food

Now I go to buy some desserts

The police of Tanage county have arrested

the director of Gantang office,

Konto,

who was suspected to kill
a four-year old child Tanage

According to our investigation,

the suspect, Konto,

suddenly became crazy

and killed his own dog

near his own shop

As Konto defended,

he only hit his dog

with metal stick

as usual

He didn't know that a child would suddenly

go into the area

It is reported that the people nearby

heard Konto calling pupils as stupid thing

And Konto always gets money by

pursuing those cats and dogs
which are roaming around

He will tie them up and

hit with metal stick

Now the police are investigating

the above events for further details

Now comes the next news

In Aogi of Yama county,

the firemen has found

a dead body of a 21-year old teenager,
Kinshi,

and his room-mate,

another 23-year old teenager, Kataoka,

At the beginning,

Kataoka was very agitated

But now the situation is under control

Now the death of Kinshi

is being investigated

The police have found out

a skull

and other bones at Kataoka's home

After laboratory investigation,
Kinshi's skin tissues

have been found on Kataoka

The police are now investigating
for further details

It is believed that this case
is directly related to Kataoka

But since Kataoka was very agitated,

the process of investigation was hindered

After he calms down,

it is believed that he would be interrogated

Maybe he would be brought back to the scene

and reorganized the case

The police now put Kataoka into prison

and refuse bail

The above are Japanese news
and reported by Hirayama

Is anybody there

Why nobody is there

Something is strange

I'm alright

Madam, do you walk past here every day

Are you their relatives

No

Then come with me

Here is not a good place to talk

What's the matter

It's better for the shop to close down

The shopkeeper has already

changed to several people

Not a single one can keep going

Each one also becomes very strange

Strange

You also think so

That couple doesn't look like normal persons

That land is the root of the problem

That land?

When a person buys the land,

he would become reluctant
to communicate with others

Iike that couple

Then there would even have murders

Sometimes mankind is really cunning

In order to achieve their aims,

they would hurt themselves deliberately

and cheat for insurance compensation

This kind of people deserve punishment

What are you saying? Derserve punishment

That shop is not made by

ordinary material

What material do you guess

Not ordinary material?

Mankind is really greedy

The shop is not made by cement

but the graves nearby

They broke the graves

and mixed the debris with other materials

The boss of that construction company

also died in a strange way

It serves him right

Miss. Ryoko

You also know that it is strange

I want you to tell me

If I were you,

I wouldn't pretend not to see anything

and not to feel anything

If so,

I would rather accept myself

to have such special power, right

I can listen to them

touch them

Of course can even look at them

Now

I am always able to see

Well

But

I will try to pretend not to see anything

even though it is wrong to do so

I have my own opinion

I will not think much about ghosts

Really

I think maybe because
I have done something bad

It is a retribution

So I am able to see those strange things

Nori, when you encounter
some strange things,

do you have such thought?

Maybe

But other people really cannot see anything

In fact there are some other things
which are not able to explain by logic

The issue itself may not be on Nori or me

These things are beyond
the control of mankind after all

So we don't need to think about
why there are strange things to happen

But just to face it
when these things have happened

Do you really think in this way

Miss. Ryoko

You would feel better
if you could think like this

Maybe you won't agree with me

But...

I would be very worried

Sometimes it sounds like
I'm thinking too much

I would feel better

if just regard it as an ordinary thing

What do you mean

And the issue is not on me

To regard it as an ordinary thing,

do you want to tell me these principles

You better quit that part-time job

Got it, Nori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori

Omori...

Omori...

Go back

Hello

Many people

are here

Hello, Mr. Tejima

Mr. Tejima

Here is quite good

All are without legs

Mr. Tejima

Thank you for your care

for so long

Goodbye

Okay

Is Yuko

I just get down from the bus

Where do you want to go to buy things

I got it, OK

Go with me. It's beautiful
Where

Quick Okay

Oh! No, I can't move

My legs cannot move

What's the matter

No...

Ladies and gentlemen

I'm Sato

The shooting of Cursed

is finally finished. Thank you

The first time I saw the film

was on a small television

Though the screen is small,

some scary scenes in the film

are enough to frighten me

This is a very scary film

I also scared when the film was shooting

Don't you have the same feeling with me

Let's see the titbits of the film

Thank you

What do you want to say

The film has almost finished shooting

It will be finished very soon

I really feel a bit unhappy about that

While the film is being shot,
I have been very happy

If the film has finished shooting,

I will have a sense of loneliness

I really want to keep working with the staff

What did you feel
when you first saw the script

When I first saw the script,

I found the beginning quite straightforward

But having the experience of
being a store-assistant,

it is still valuable to me

At the beginning, I was not that concentrated

but later it was greatly improved

I think I am going to be a good actor

Do you watch scary films

No

When I see some scary scenes,

I would be very frightened

I would immediatedly use
my hands to cover my face

When did you first go to funerals

I went to funerals before

I will try my best

Is there anything that is
particularly hard to you

It is that

I had to get used to many new things

at the beginning

I was not used to at the beginning

Did you seek advice from other people

I did seek advice from my seniors

I once hurt my finger carelessly

I was very worried

but my seniors always encouraged me

I am very grateful to them

What do you think

I will try other films as well

and will work very hard

to train my acting

Please continue to give me encouragement

I'm Sato

This story is about

many scary things keep on
happening in a store

The story is really excellent

Please feel free to give suggestions

Mankind is the most terrible creature
Don't you know that

There are lots of people around us
What kind of people would you meet?

Maybe he would become
hysterical in front of you

Who? Who?

The scary legend of city

finally becomes a movie

Tokyo Psycho

A young writer with freshness

It's written by Hirayama

the new launch of

director Tomie, Katagawachu

What do you want to tell me?

I have forgotten

Oh! Yes

I have important thing to tell you

I have also just got it

We've found lgumi's present address

Please blame me louder

I like to hear those words

It feels good

This city is covered with craziness

It is adapted from real cases

The craziest, abnormal criminal

No

Coming slowly from beautiful girls

It is hard to believe

Everything becomes crazy

In this city

if you are not crazy

you will die
