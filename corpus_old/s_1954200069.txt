<i>AVA: My father always told me</i>

<i>that he wouldn't be around</i>
<i>forever to protect me.</i>

<i>He was an outlaw.</i>

<i>And he knew his days</i>
<i>were numbered.</i>

<i>He told me that the only person</i>

<i>I could ever rely on was myself.</i>

<i>And even that person</i>
<i>may let you down.</i>

( dog barking )

<i>My father taught me</i>
<i>how to fight.</i>

<i>To survive.</i>

<i>To never be a victim.</i>

<i>To never cry.</i>

<i>Because those tears</i>
<i>would be used against me.</i>

Come on.

( gunshots )

<i>And when he was killed,</i>
<i>I never cried.</i>

<i>Never.</i>

( gun cocking )

<i>Not once.</i>

( music playing )

DEREK'S FATHER: I want
you to be happy,

but it doesn't hurt
to be cautious.

It's not like you are high
school sweethearts, okay?

You guys met at a needle
exchange, for Christ's sake.

DEREK: It was
Narcotics Anonymous,

and she is the reason
that I am still clean.

Yes, and I appreciate that,

but there are still
a lot of unknowns.

Which has a habit
of repeating itself...

SANDY: My brother's
a lucky man.

My dad always said
consistent luck is skill.

Well, then my brother's
consistently lucky.

<i>LAWYER: Pre-nups are the norm</i>
<i>today, Derek.</i>

<i>Marriage is business.</i>

If it goes south, you're gonna
need an exit strategy.

Ava already signed.

If you want to disown
or disinherit me,

please draw up the papers
and I will gladly sign them,

but I do not need
an exit or a strategy.

<i>SANDY: Now someone out there</i>
<i>I should introduce myself to?</i>

Any family, friends?

That's okay, you've got us now.

We're your family.

PRIEST: Please be seated.

Derek and Ava have arrived

at this very special moment
in their lives.

PRIEST: I Derek...

I Derek...

PRIEST: Take you, Ava...

Take you, Ava...

PRIEST: to be my wife.

To be my wife.

( airplane engine starting )

Oh, my God.
She's freaking out.

Freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.

DEREK: My grandfather,
he bought this

back in the '40s for nothing.

And we used to come here
in the summer

when we were kids.

But now, my dad thinks
it's too rustic

and he'll only stay
at the Four Seasons.

What do you think?

AVA: It's amazing.

Right there,
that is my grandmother

on her wedding day.

And this here, that's my uncle,

and my mom

when she was two
or three years old.

You know, this is the first time

that I've actually been here
since she died.

She would've loved you.

I wish I could've met her.

Yeah.

( music playing )

Whoa.

DEREK: Why aren't I driving?

I should be the driver!


(Derek yells)

AVA: Whoo!

(reggae music playing)

What are you thinking?

I think I'm supposed
to be asking you that.

Typically, yeah, but...

Oh, my gosh!

Hello.
May I?

What's your name?

Ricardo.
Ricardo?

You're handsome.

It looks good on you.
It works.

You think so?

Hello. Hello.

Oh, oh, he wants his daddy back.

And we'll take him.

Come on.
Come on, little one.

You will be a great mother.

You think so?

Oh, I know so.

I didn't really have
the best influence.

Yeah, well, you know,
we both got

an education in how not
to raise your kids.

So...

<i>El baÃ±o.</i>

I have to go to the bathroom.

That's Spanish for...

You learn something new
every day.

All right, I'll be right back.

Give me a little kiss.

Do not go anywhere.

Stay right there.
Do not move.

(crowd chatter in Spanish)

<i>MAN: Hola, como estÃ¡?</i>

<i>Bien.</i>

Manny.

Ava.

Nice to meet you, Ava.

It's a beautiful,
the view, isn't it?

It's gorgeous.

Where you from?

Connecticut.

Do you know Earl Sanders?

Mmm...

ah, I don't think so.

Well, he comes here every year.

He's from Connecticut.

Oh.

Connecticut is kind of
a large space.

( speaking in Spanish )

I have family in Texas.

Okay.
Yeah.

Okay, not that close, but okay.

Babe, this is Manny.
He has family in Texas.

Hey, man, what's up?

Wow, what's up?

All good. All good.
Good.

Welcome.
Thank you.

So how much longer are you guys
on the island for?

A few more days.

And nights.

Have you been to Cabarete?

Uh, I don't think so.

Oh, it's a beautiful,
beautiful place.

The longest zip lines
in the Caribbean.

And the rain forest.
No.

I'm afraid of heights.

That sounds awesome.
Oh, come on.

My friend runs the place.

I can take you guys tomorrow.

And it's a very safe place.

Only one person died there
last year.

Only one person!

Relax. I'm joking.

I'm joking.

How about dancing?
You guys like dancing?

Ooh, I prefer zip-lining,
but...

I love dancing, but this one...

I can't dance.

Well, my friend, my friend runs

the hottest club
in the entire island.

We can go there.

I don't care.

I'd love to.

Well, we can do both things.
You'd love to?

Yeah.

I'll tell you
what I'd love to do.

( music playing )

( cheering )

( speaking in foreign language )

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

We don't drink!

<i>WOMAN: Salud</i>!

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

(crowd chatter)

( music continues )

( growls )

( speaking in Spanish )

All right, all right.

DEREK: Ease up on
the hands there, chief.

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

It's all right, babe.

DEREK:
Come back to me, babe.

AVA: Okay.

MAN:
Hey, forget that<i> gringo</i>,
you're dancing with me.

Relax, man.
This is my girl, all right?

( speaking in Spanish )

<i>Tranquilo!</i> Come on!

( speaking in Spanish )

MANNY: Take it easy.

( arguing in Spanish )

( crowd roars )

( speaking in Spanish )

( crowd cheering )

( cheering continues )

AVA: You little bitch!

( indistinct )

Fuck!
Ava, it's me!

Babe, we gotta go now!

Come on, come on, come on!

All right, babe.

You're all right.
Let's go.

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's go, Manny!
Come on, man!

All right, babe, come here.
Get in.

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

( speaking in Spanish )

I'm fucking tired of this shit!

I was just dancing
with that<i> chava</i>, that's all.

( speaking in Spanish )

Yo, what the hell?

I guess we're not going to that
club tomorrow night, huh?

You know that man
that you just messed with?

That's Big Biz, dude.

That was fucking bad!

Oh, my, dude.

I better watch out
for you, girl.

You went crazy!

Like fucking ninja,
fucking crazy!

Manny! Manny!
Let it go.

Drop it.

( Ava groans )

What the hell was that?

AVA: Sorry.

( speaking in Spanish )

<i>MAN: Best piece of advice</i>
<i>I ever got?</i>

Don't trust anybody.

You whoring like your old man?

Hmm?

I got no problem with 15.

I like 15.

<i>Sometimes, the only way</i>
<i>to defend yourself</i>

<i>is to attack!</i>

Hold her down!

You just wanna be harder,
quicker, faster,

dirtier than the next guy,
you understand?

Ahh! Fucking bitch!

Eventually, you forget
about the pain,

forget about the fear,

you remember the lesson.
You understand me?

Too slow!

Most people have a limit
they won't go beyond.

You're gonna learn to go beyond.

You're gonna learn
to go beyond the limit.

You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

Somebody's gonna put you down...

you put them in the ground.

( knocking on door )

What time is it?

I don't know.
My God...

( banging on door )

All right. I'll get it.

Coming! Coming!

Manny?

Hi. Please open the door,
man.

Yo.
DEREK: What?

Big Biz from last night,

he's on his way over
with his boys,

and he's not coming
to apologize.

How could they possibly know
where we're staying?

I don't know.

Maybe the taxi driver
told him or something.

Just get your shit on,
we're out of here.

Seriously?

Where the hell
are we gonna go, man? Huh?

<i>Estoy jodiendo,</i> man.

I'm just fucking with you.

That's not cool.
Not cool.

I just had to get you guys up

so we can get
to the zipline in time.

MANNY: Come on!

No, I'm not going.

No, when did we even
agree to that?

( speaking in Spanish )

Safest place for you guys to be.

We have to go,
'cause if we get there late,

Jojo, the guy from the zipline,
is gonna leave us.

( laughing )

DEREK: All right.
AVA: No.

Next!
You're next. You're next.

Come on!

Oh, God.
All right, babe.

Oh, God.

You got it. It's all good.

Will you make sure this is...

Yeah, everything's good, here.

All right.

DEREK: Just in case
I don't see you again.

Don't say that!

Lower the glove there, okay?

Lean back and enjoy the ride.

There you go.

AVA: Oh, my God!

MAN: Lean back!
Lean back!

AVA: Oh, my God!

MANNY: Oh, my God, man!

You're here! You're here!
You're here!

Yeah.
Bring it down, bring it down.

Wow.

MANNY: Do it, man!

Whoa!

Ah! Ha, ha, ha.

MANNY: Yeah, bro!

That was good.
How was that, man?

How do you feel?

That was awesome.

Oh, man,
It was awesome.

You have not seen anything yet.

What do you mean?

Where we're gonna go now
is the real deal.<i> El Viudador.</i>

Wait, what does that mean?

"The Widow Maker."

( whispers ) The widow maker.

MANNY: So here we are!

<i>El Viudador!</i>

MANNY: Check this out.

AVA: Oh, my God.
MANNY: It's amazing, isn't it?

Oh, I... I don't think
I can do this.

( Manny speaks in Spanish )

MANNY:
The longest zipline
in the Caribbean.

I can't do this, babe.
Don't, please.

Like seriously you can't?

I don't think so.

Just sit back,
enjoy the ride, okay.

Let's do it.

So I'm the only one going?
Yeah.

( speaking in Spanish )

( wind rushing )

<i>DEREK: Zoom in.</i>

<i>He's too far away.</i>

( laughs )

( speaking in Spanish )

One mile.

A whole mile?
A whole mile.

Oh, God.

Wow.

( Manny screaming )

AVA: Okay.

DEREK: All right.

Ready?
There you...

DEREK: Oh, boy!
( Ava laughs )

AVA: Oh, no.

(Derek laughs)

Oh, my God!

Whoo-hoo!

I married a lunatic.

Oh.

DEREK: Hello!

Wow!

( line tensing )

Ah-ha-ha!

( ripping )

Whoo!

Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

Stop.

Whoa.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck!

Get out there and help him.

( speaking in Spanish )

MANNY: Hold on, man!

MANNY: Hold on, man!
DEREK: Fuck!

DEREK: Fuck!

MANNY: I got you, man!

I got you!

Hey, hey,...

I got a handle.

MANNY: Big<i> cojones</i>
is what you got,<i> cabron.</i>

Slowly let go of your legs,
okay?

MANNY:
Let go, let go, okay.

Come on.


DEREK: Help me.

Yeah, follow me.

Okay, one, two...

MANNY:
Okay, I got you,
I got you. Hold on.

Hold on, hold on.
Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.
Hold on!

Hold on! Hold on.

DEREK: I'm slipping!

MANNY: Come on.

MANNY: Wait, wait.
Give me your other hand.

( grunting )

( struggling and shouting )

Don't let go!

( screaming )

Call an ambulance.

Fuck!

( speaking in Spanish )

AVA: Derek!

Derek!

Derek!

( mobile ringing )

( mobile continues ringing )

Oh, my God. Babe?

Derek? Derek?

AVA: Manny!

Manny, help!

( speaking in Spanish )

No, no.
Whoa, whoa!

I'm going with my husband.

I'm going!

I'm going with him!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

( speaking in Spanish )

It's something about insurance.

That's ridiculous!

I can go with my husband.

( speaking in Spanish )

Okay, where are you going?

( speaking in Spanish )

Here.

It's the main hospital here.

It's good.

Go!
Go!

Move!

( speaking in Spanish )

Where's Manny?

( speaking in Spanish )

I don't know.

( siren blaring )

( cars speeding )
( Honking )

( tires screeching )

( speaking in Spanish )

No, no.
I have to go to Centro Medico...

( speaking in Spanish )

Excuse me.

I'm so sorry.

I am so sorry.

( speaking in Spanish )

My husband came in here,
Derek Grant,

about 20 or 30 minutes ago
in an ambulance.

Can you check your charts?

( speaking in Spanish )

No, no, no, I'm fine.

He's in much worse condition.

( speaking in Spanish )

Please check
a Derek Grant for me, please?

( speaking in Spanish )

No, no, no.

He's blond with blue eyes.

WOMAN: American.

( speaking in Spanish )

( phone ringing )

<i>DEREK: ( recorded ) You've</i>
<i>reached Derek, but guess what?</i>

<i>He's on his honeymoon.</i>

( speaking in Spanish )

<i>You've reached Derek,</i>
<i>but guess what...</i>

No Derek Grant.

Is this Centro Medico?

Are we here?

( speaking in Spanish )

They brought him here.

The ambulance people
gave me this card.

My husband is here,
they dropped him off.

He got in an ambulance
and came here.

( speaking in Spanish )

WOMAN:
No Derek Grant here.

Is there another Centro Medico?

( Woman in Spanish )

<i>WOMAN: SeÃ±ora</i>!

( guard speaking in Spanish )

( phone ringing )

<i>GUARD: SeÃ±ora!</i>

( guard speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

Please don't touch me.

Get your hands off me!

Please, ma'am!

Excuse me, ma'am.

Excuse me.

<i>Estoy buscando a</i> Derek Grant.

Here?

( speaking in Spanish )

Can you check your charts?

This is him.

Is he here?

Did he come in here
by ambulance?

No. No.

( sobbing ) Excuse me, ma'am.

( speaking in Spanish )

I'm looking for my husband.

This is what he looks like.

Ma'am, have you seen him?

Can you please help me?

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>CINDY: Oh, hi.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

Has Derek called you?

<i>No.</i>
<i>Why, what's wrong?</i>

My husband is missing.

( speaking in Spanish )

Ah, no English.
Do you speak English?

( speaking in Spanish )

WOMAN:
And she call hospital
for your husband, okay?

<i>Quit moving.</i>

You think you need my help, Ava?

Do you need anybody's help?

You don't.

The only person you can rely on
is your own self.

This will heal up.

Survivors have scars.

Losers have funerals.

Scars are what you want.

They're like tattoos.

But with better story, huh?

Ava, you are made
with the toughest stuff around.

Don't you forget that,
all right?

( airplane roaring )

Who called for the ambulance?

I'm not sure.

I think that his name is Jojo.

That's what Manny called him.

This Manny,
he took you to the zipline?

Yeah.

He's on the left.

Last name?

I don't know.

OFFICER:
Where did you meet him?

At some restaurant on a beach.

Some restaurant on a beach?

Why didn't you ride
in the ambulance

with your husband?

They wouldn't let me.

They wouldn't let you?

I...I think
they said it was

because of some
insurance problem.

But I tried.

Did they say
where they were taking him?

I already told you this.
Centro Medico Punta Cana.

Punta Cana.

Punta Cana?

( speaking in Spanish )

<i>Gracias.</i>

There's no record
showing of your husband

being admitted into any clinic
or hospital on the island.

Maybe he decided to not go.

Okay, "Not go?"

He was unconscious

and his leg
was completely sideways.

How the hell
is he not going to go?

There's no activity
on his credit card.

No outgoing calls on his phone,

so it's either dead

or his battery has been taken
out so it can't be tracked.

Maybe the ambulance
had an accident on the way

to the hospital.

Maybe it fell into a ditch

and no one was able
to contact us or call.

Okay, I don't know,
but we need to be out of here,

out there looking for him.

DEREK'S FATHER: Maybe
we're not getting

all the information
that we need.

What does that mean?

Was anyone drinking?

You know
there wasn't any drinking.

I have a right to ask.

You already know
the answer to that.

Well there are many ambulance
companies on this island,

they're unregulated,
so it's highly competitive.

First one on the scene
gets paid.

It's a wonderful island,
but with opportunistic

and dubious parties,

everybody's trying to make

a better standing
for themselves.

Especially when it comes
at the expense of

wealthy Americans.

Then again, I could be wrong.

If he was kidnapped,
we should know something soon.

I'd say
within the next 24 hours...

Oh, my gosh.

So what's our next step?

MAN: We were closed yesterday.

Actually, we're always
closed on Monday,

so there was no one here.

AVA: No, no, I was here.

I was here with my husband,
Manny and Jojo.

No, no, sorry.

We don't have any Manny
or Jojo working here.

Manny doesn't work here.

He said he was friends
with the owner.

Actually, I'm the owner.

Okay, the name of the zipline

is called El Viudador.

No, no, we don't call any
of our lines El Viudador.

Are you sure
it was here, because...

Yes, it was here.

Well, we have
a perfect safety record

and there are like
four other line operations

on the island which...

Look, it was here.

I remember the road in,
I remember the fire station,

I remember all of this.

There's another zipline
about 30 minutes from here

with the same kind of rope
and it looks exactly the same.

Hey!

Wait.

Jojo, right?

You were here yesterday

when my husband
fell from the zipline, right?

<i>This is Jojo.</i>

( speaking in Spanish )

No.

He says he doesn't know
who you are.

Why are you lying?
You called the ambulance.

( speaking in Spanish )

Why are you lying?

Okay, hey.

We were here yesterday.

Admit that you were here.

Admit that you were here.

Let me handle this, okay?

Let me handle this.

Okay, look, maybe he thinks
he's getting in trouble.

Maybe he thinks
you'll get him trouble.

He got paid off.

I don't know.

Listen, you got to understand.

It wasn't here, okay?

You're scaring my customers.

( speaking in Spanish )

Okay, look,
let's go back to my office.

No.

Let's talk about the next step.

Get him back!
No, no.

We got to go.
Please go!

We need to go.

Please, please.
Please, please, please.

( speaking in Spanish )

AVA: That was him.
That was Jojo.

Fine, yes, we'll go back
and talk about it at the office.

We should get him,
don't you think?

Everything okay?
Everything is safe.

You are going to enjoy,
enjoy yourself so far?

Have a seat.

Let's talk about Sunday night.

I got an e-mail sent to me
of a video footage

from Club La Zona.

And apparently you have
a really violent side to you.

You on drugs?

Because you nearly
killed this guy.

I was defending myself.

Why didn't you say
anything about that?

Because I didn't see
how this had got anything

to do with
Derek's disappearance.

You sure about that?

<i>Gracias.</i>

So you got into a tangle
with a guy named Big Biz.

You know
he makes people disappear.

Then why aren't you
interviewing him?

We will.

So how were you
and your husband getting along?

We're great.

I understand

you're the main beneficiary
of all his assets.

I'm his wife.

What are these?

Sketches.

Why aren't
they being distributed?

Because they look like
half the men on the island

and I have to appropriately
allocate my resources.

Yeah, what exactly are you
doing with your resources?

Right now?

If you're not going to
look for my husband, I will.

Let's go.

What happened?

( inaudible speaking )

Oh. Derek.

Derek, stop!

Stop!

Derek!

( speaking in Spanish )

No, no.
Sorry.

Wrong car.

I'm gonna make some pasta.
Do you want some?

No, thanks.

Ava, you haven't eaten
in two days.

Maybe just some water?

( door closing )

<i>Derek Grant, who disappeared</i>
<i>three days ago.</i>

<i>The couple</i>
<i>were on their honeymoon</i>

<i>on the island.</i>

<i>All previous leads</i>
<i>have been dismissed</i>

<i>as attempts to cash in</i>

<i>on the considerable</i>
<i>reward money.</i>

Did anyone call?

You're not really expecting
any calls, are you, Ava?

What?

What really happened?

What aren't you telling us?

You think there's something
I'm not telling you?

I think there's a great deal
you're not telling us.

Dad.

Maybe something went down
at that bar

and Derek got killed.

Or maybe somebody
wanted to kill you

and killed him instead.

Or maybe you guys just kinda...

fell off the program
and things got violent.

I don't know.

But I do know

that you are the reason
he's gone.

And I think you're trying
to tap into my finances.

I don't give a shit
about your finances, Mr. Grant.

I love your son.

I love him more than I loved
anything in my entire life,

and I always will.

Fuck you.

( door slamming )

( speaking in Spanish )

Excuse me.
Excuse me, sorry.

Lady, you need to wait a minute.

She's going first.

Remember me?

Oh, shit.

Let's find some place
where we can have a talk.

No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!

Fuck!
Shit!

No!

No!

No!

No, no!

( speaking in Spanish )

Okay, Jojo, you're gonna start

telling me some information
or you're gonna die.

Do you understand that?

Look at me!

What happened to my husband?

I don't know, lady!

You want to drop?

No! No!

Did you take me
and my husband ziplining?

Look at me!

Did you take me
and my husband ziplining?

Yeah!

Why did you lie
to the cops about it?

I don't know.

Manny, Manny told us to...

be quiet.

Manny told us that
they were very dangerous.

Who was dangerous?
Who was dangerous?

I don't know.
I don't know.

Listen, you want to die,
motherfucker?

No! No!

Okay, look at me.

Who called the ambulance?

<i>Manny called.</i>

<i>Manny called the ambulance.</i>

<i>So he knows.</i>
<i>He knows everything, please.</i>

<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

<i>I have his number.</i>

<i>All right.</i>
<i>All right, what's his number?</i>

<i>It's 809-555-3210.</i>

I tried the cell phone, it went
straight to the voicemail,

but it's definitely
Manny's voice.

You believe me now?

Manny knows where Derek is.

We need to find Manny.

Let's go.

( speaking in Spanish )

Turn around.
What?

Turn around.

Let's go find my husband!

Hey!


( speaking in Spanish )

Maybe you can torture people
in America

to get a confession out of them,

but not here.

And I'm gonna let you leave here

with some dignity intact.

Officer Santos is gonna
take you back to Puerto Rico.

You are no longer welcome
on this island.

Do you understand that?

( horn blowing )

Excuse me, sir,
I have to go to the bathroom.

( speaking in Spanish )

Are you gonna
take my handcuffs off?

Get in.

Well, you're gonna
have to come in here

and help me.

( urinating )

Can you get me some tissue?

( speaking in Spanish )

So my boyfriend thought

it would be funny
to throw me in the pool.

( speaking in Spanish )

I'm going to kill him.

( party music playing )

( speaking in Spanish )

Are you alone?

<i>Si.</i>

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's hope so.

[party music playing]

( speaking in Spanish )

Hello, Manny.

People don't just disappear.

No!
I'm here illegally.

I can't talk to the cops
or they'll send me back!

You're gonna wish
you were back home.

I swear!

I don't know anything
about your husband!

Where's Derek?
I don't know!

You called the ambulance.

I did!

But when I called,
they said that someone else

had already called in.

Who?

I don't know!

( banging on door )

( speaking in Spanish )

Who are these guys?

Who are your buddies?

What is that?
What is that?

It's a tattoo that one
of the paramedics had.

This guy has that tattoo.

That's their fucking
neighborhood!

That's T.S.

( speaking in Spanish )

They own that shit.

Everybody knows that.

Police, the politicians,
even the<i> putas</i> know that.

If you're fucking with me,
things are gonna get nasty.

Nastier than this shit?

( knocking on door )

( speaking in Spanish )

You're not safe here.

Tell me something I don't know.

If you want me
to help you find Derek,

you have to deal
with... ( indistinct ).

( banging on door )

[speaking in foreign language]

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's go over here.

This is my room.

( speaking in Spanish )

So you live with your mom.

I came over first...

and made enough money
to bring her over.

There's not enough work in
the island where we come from,

except for fucking drugs.

Tomorrow you're gonna
take me to ( indistinct ).

We're gonna work together
to find this guy.

They say that
if a person isn't found

within the first few days,
the likelihood...

Don't.
Please don't.

Just don't.

I'm sorry.

Derek is alive and I'm gonna do

whatever it takes
to get him back.

You should probably
understand that.

I do.

So relax.

You should get some rest.

Get in there.

In this place, there's no law,

there's no mommy,
there's no daddy, okay?

Everything you see
is not really what it is.

Everybody here is trained

to be unwelcoming.

( speaking in Spanish )

Yeah.

( speaking in Spanish )

No.

( speaking in Spanish )

No.

Yeah, everybody here
is off the grid.

They're either not from here

or they've been let go
by everyone.

Stay, okay?

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

Hold on, hold on.

What?
That's it, that's it.

What's what?
Stop, go back, go back!

All right.

What is it?
Just stop.

That's it, that's it.

What?
That's his tattoo.

The paramedic,
the one with gold teeth,

that is his tattoo.
Look.

What's this?

That's when they do
the cock fights and stuff.

I know where it is. Let's go.
Okay.

All right.
Let's get out.

No, no, no.

Don't get out, okay?

Just give me the flyer.

Stay here.

( cellular beeps )

( crowd cheering )

( speaking in Spanish )

Hey, where are you?

<i>AVA: I found him.</i>

I can't hear you!
What?

What the fuck, man!

( dog barking )

( speaking in Spanish )

( dog barking )

( man yells )

( man screaming )

AVA: You and your partner
took my husband

in your ambulance.

Where did you take him?

I don't drive an ambulance.

( screams )

My father was not
a well-educated man,

but he did know
a little something

about the human anatomy.

He showed me
where all the vital organs are.

You have the wrong guy!

See, the tummy is squishy.

You've got the colon,
the small intestine.

It's the squishy stuff
that's hard to puncture.

( speaking in Spanish )

Where is my husband?

I told you,
I don't know anything!

Maybe I should just go
for your spleen.

But you can live without
your spleen, can't you?

Where's my husband?

I don't know.

Or I could go for your liver.

Puncturing it would probably
make you bleed out

in five or six minutes.

Okay, okay, okay!
Okay.

This girl was texting me.

I got dropped off!

I don't know
what happened after that,

I swear!

Next day, Omar comes over
with a bunch of money.

He told me to quit my job,
not to say anything.

So I did it, okay?

I did!

You're looking for Omar, not me!

It's him
you're looking for, not me!

( grunting )

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

I'm texting your brother.

He'll fucking kill you!

You tried.

How'd that work out for you?

( radio music playing )

( door opens )

( speaking in Spanish )

Timo?

( fighting )

AVA: Remember me?

I bet you do.

Now you're gonna tell me
where my husband is.

Where is my husband?

( pocketknife opens )

( gunshot )

( siren blaring )

You break into someone's house
and assault them?

They have every right
to use deadly force

to defend themselves.

Timo admitted to taking
my husband in an ambulance.

He's in on it.

I don't know.
He said he got paid.

Let her out.

Let's go.

I'll tell you what I think.

I think you paid those two guys,

who are really no choir boys,
to kill your husband.

And then you silenced them,

so that they wouldn't
implicate you.

You know, from the beginning,

the only violence and wrongdoing

that I've witnessed has been
perpetrated by you and only you.

You are being held for
the murder of Omar Tavarez

and the attempted murder
of Timo Tavarez.

And you are now officially
the prime suspect

in the disappearance

and probable murder
of your husband.

So you know what?

A bath, a shower, and a lawyer.

Whatever order you want,
that's what you need.

Look, fine, take me,
but my husband's alive.

You need to find him.

He's still out there.
He's alive.

Taking you to headquarters
for further interrogation.

Please!
Please look at me!

My husband's alive!

Yeah, well,
we're gonna transfer you

over to headquarters
for the interrogation.

Derek's father and sister
have requested

that you be charged
with a capital offense.

Please find my husband for me.

Please, do your job.

Good luck.

My husband is alive.

( speaking in Spanish )

We're not going
to police headquarters, are we?

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

( digging )

( bone breaking )

( digging continues )

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's go.

( door banging )

( grunting )

( phone vibrating )

( speaking in Spanish )

<i>AVA: No.</i>
<i>You know what that means.</i>

Ava.

<i>Why don't you come</i>
<i>to your daughter's room</i>

<i>and we can have a little talk.</i>

( lamp clicks )

GARZA (whispering ):
Please, don't.

AVA: Shh!

Keep your voice down.

You don't want to
wake your daughter.

Gun.

Sit.

My family.
Your family?

Let's talk about your family.

What would you be willing to do?

Where would you be
willing to go?

Look, it was me.

I did this.

You don't understand, I owe him.

Who?

Avilar.

The doctor
from Villa Jaragual Clinic.

Look, he did something
for me, okay?

She... She was too young,

and he just made sure

the family didn't find out
about her pregnancy.

I owe him everything.

If my wife and kids...

Yeah, you're a real family man.

I can see that.

Where's my husband?

The doctor, he made a mistake.

He tried to set his bone...

and he punctured
his femoral artery.

He tried to save him.

Look, he asked me...

he begged me to cover it up.

Otherwise,
the American would make sure

his clinic was finished.

He wanted to make it seem
like he never made it

to the clinic at all.

You've been lying to me
this whole time.

You knew my husband was dead?

And you tried to have me killed?

You need to go.

Please don't do this.

Not in front of my family
and my daughter, please.

I understand, okay?

I don't deserve to live.

I'm a bad man.

Please, not here.

You have two options.

One...

two.

One of these is quiet.

We can go to the bathroom.

I'll make sure
your wife finds you,

not your kid.

( door opens )

( door closes )

( banging on door )

( crying )

MANNY: What the hell
happened to you?

He's gone.

He's gone.

Derek showed up,
when he could've...

He saved me.

He changed me.

You changed you.

He just gave you a reason.

I have to finish this.

"When all the bastards
are gone and dead,

only then rest your head."

( speaking in Spanish )

That's cheery.

Where is that from?

I heard that every night
before I went to sleep.

That's a pretty shitty lullaby.

I can help you.

No, you can't.

I have to do this on my own.

What the hell
happened to your hand?

Shit.

You should go see a doctor.

I plan to.

First thing tomorrow.

( grunting )

Can you just please check
a Derek Grant for me?

Please.

No Derek Grant.

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

You have a limited amount
of oxygen,

so I want you
to listen to me carefully.

I want to know
what happened to my husband.

He is the American
with the broken leg.

I want to know how he died

and what happened to his body.

Are you ready to tell me
everything I need to know?

I don't know
what you're talking about.

I have no idea...

Really?

Derek Grant!

Garza, the little girl,
the pregnancy!

Please, I just need to know.

( speaking in foreign language )

Fine. Fine.

( speaking in foreign language )

You don't understand.
You don't know what...

Really, because I think
it's pretty fucking simple!

( gasping )

( door buzzing )

Wait.

Wait!

I think you're gonna find out

everything
you ever wished to know.

Take a look.

Take a look.

You...

You told Garza he's dead.

No, wait.

I can help you.

You pull that trigger,

then your husband
is gonna be dead for sure.

( elevator door opens )

( speaking in Spanish )

Christie.

Christie.

Silvio Lugo.

What happened to your hand?

Got it caught in a door.

Stupid door.

Right?
Yeah.

I'm gonna need to search you.

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

Call me.

( speaking in Spanish )

Hey, S, how you feeling, my man?

Huh?

Ready to give some
of that miracle milk?

You are my golden ticket.

( speaking in Spanish )

Doc, what are you waiting for?

Some anesthesia.

No, no, no.
My man can handle it.

Can't you, Papi?

Yeah, fuck that.

Go.

That's it.

Get him all nice and clean.

( speaking in Spanish )

But you're so cute,
I don't care.

You can do anything you like.

( speaking in Spanish )

That's it.

Show me, Doc.

( groans )

It's okay, Papi.

You can handle it.

There you go.

( groaning )

There you go.

It's okay.

That's it.

You're doing a good job, bro.

Doing a great job.

That's it, Papa.

That's it.

Good boy.

That's a good boy.

Come on, Doc, give me that.

Yeah...

that's what I like to see.

A real fountain of life.

Thank you, Papi.

( chuckles )

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

You trying to put me to sleep?

Doc, where'd you find this girl?

( speaking in foreign language )

Nobody fucking move!

Put your fucking hands up!

Hey!
Hey!

( speaking in Spanish )

Give me the gun.

Down.

Get the fuck down!

Who the fuck are you?

I'm his wife.

Oh.

So you're the girl my man here

has been speaking so highly of.

Who, who!
Was that necessary?

All this violence!

Seriously, we're all helping
each other here.

Your husband has been
a real life saver, you know?

I have this rare type of cancer.

( speaking in Spanish )

Multiple myeloma.

Yeah, yeah, that's it.

And the only effective treatment

are these stem cell transfusions
from bone marrow.

You know, I pay the doctor
here good money

But it ain't easy, is it, Doc?

( speaking in Spanish )

Stay back!

( speaking in Spanish )

Hey, listen, you need
to learn more Spanish, babe.

Listen,
I can call some of my men,

the ones you haven't
shot already,

and they can help you
find your way out.

I can find my own way out.

Are you sure?
It's a big building.

You know what?

Thank you, Christie,
for sharing your husband.

( speaking in Spanish )

( gunshots )

( elevator door closing )

We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

So...

what you been up to, huh?

I'm gonna need you
to help me, okay?

Yeah.

Okay.

( elevator door opening )

( door opening )

( speaking in Spanish )

( gun shooting )

( container exploding )

( screaming )

( speaking in Spanish )

You guys suck, motherfuckers.

Easy, easy.

Keep this on him.

( tires screeching )

You know, I can pay you
for what you've done.

I should've offered you
money up front,

but people are so selfish

when it comes to donating
their body parts.

I just couldn't take the risk

when it's so hard to find
a bone marrow of a donor

who's tissue is a perfect match.

You know,
with your husband's bone marrow

and my strict diet...

Ah!

Bro, your girl hits hard.

Where you gonna run,
little rabbit?

You realize you're on an island.

My island!

Things are gonna end up
badly for you guys, seriously.

Tell me, Derek, do you even know

how to use one of those things

( screaming )

Yeah, I do.

( speaking in Spanish )

You two motherfuckers are crazy.

( speaking in Spanish )

Do you see anyone?

Take the left!

( horn honking )

Right there in the yellow dress.
Go left. Right there.

Got it.

All right.
Where's this next turn?

Right there,
right there, right there.

Pink shirt, next right.

( crashing )

( speaking in Spanish )

Let's go.
Get out of the car.

Go, go.

( speaking in Spanish )

( gunshots )

I'm gonna find you!

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go.

( indistinct )

( speaking in Spanish )

Come, come.

( speaking in Spanish )

You've been shot, right?

What?
Come here.

You sit down. Damn it.

Shh.

We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

Where is safe?

( horn honking )

( indistinct )

( speaking in Spanish )

( loud music playing )

( grunting )

( grunting )

( phone ringing )

( gun shots )

( speaking in Spanish )

( grunting)

You know what?

( speaking in Spanish )

Come on.

You know, it didn't have to go
down like this, Mama.

You fucking bitch.

Come on, show me what you got.

Show me you got.

( speaking in Spanish )

You wanna fuck with me?

Come on.

( phone beeps )

( speaking in Spanish )

I hope you had a nice honeymoon.

( crowd cheering )

( speaking in Spanish )

Ava, don't do it!

( speaking in Spanish )

We can't have tourists
being kidnapped

to prolong the life
of this piece of shit!

Give me the knife.

Give me the knife.

This doesn't concern you,
<i>cabrÃ³n.</i>

It does
because it's my business!

What business?

Fucking<i> putas</i>
and gambling business?

Yes!

My<i> putitas</i> can't work
without tourists!

And we're gonna
gamble by ourselves?

Give me the knife.

Give me the knife.

Give it to me!

( speaking in Spanish )

Aren't you dying?

Aren't you dying now?

Yeah.

Correction.

You're dead.

Let her go!
Let her go...

Derek!
Are you okay?

Are you okay?

( speaking in Spanish )

Okay.

You!

It's time for you to go home,
where you belong!

( speaking in Spanish )

( speaking in Spanish )

My friend Carlos is gonna be
taking you to Puerto Rico.

Keep the shirt, bro.

Brought me good luck.

Thank you...

for everything.

Bye!

Come back soon!

Miss you already!
