Well, of course he did.

How much he loan you?

I don't even know.

You know. How much?

How much?

Fifteen hundred.

Fuck me, Rodney.

Where you gonna get that money
to pay him back with, huh?

And what else you gonna owe him?

You got a check coming in
from somewhere or...?

No.
You know, 'cause I ain't

got that kind of cash
lying around to bail you out.

Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No. Don't fuck around with John Petty.

I'm not fucking around with him.

He gave me a fucking tip,
it didn't pay off.

Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?

He seems awfully quiet
last few times he was here.

Yeah, he stop-lossed again.

He's going back next month.
Ahh...

Those poor sons of guns. They're
holding them against their will.

They're gonna run them into
the ground, they're not careful.

Don't get me started.

Well, if he turns up,

you tell him I headed
home to see Lena?

Sure.
All right.


Oh, hey, I got this one.

Whoa, thanks, Dan.

Is, uh... Is John in?

I just, you know,
need to bend his ear.

Uh, he had someone
back there earlier,

but, uh, I think they
might be gone.

All right if I...
Yeah.

HARLAN: If I have to come all the way
down here again, I swear to God,

I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.

You hear me, Petty?

You better start following
through on your promises.

Oh, you know I can't control
some of those fuckers.

HARLAN: For 25 grand,
you'd better control them.

I ought to put a piece
of lead in your ass

and take everything in here.
John, you back here?

Oh, I'm sorry, should I
come back later or...?

No, it's OK. We're finishing up.

Your mama teach you
to barge in like that?

You got a problem with me?

I got a problem with everybody.

(DOOR CREAKING)

Who the fuck are they?

Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.

Church ain't over until
the snakes are back in the bag,

What are they doing down here?

Don't ask.

Here.
Oh, no, I'm good.

Take it.

What's up?

Oh, here.

It's from Rodney.

I know it's not nearly all there.

I hate that you work your ass off
to pay his debt.

Rodney needs to watch it.

I like him, Russell, I really do,
but I worry that...

Hell, he might be
safer over in Iraq.

Well, do you mind not
telling him I brought you that,

please, and if he don't
bring the rest of it,

I will on my next payday.

OK.

I won't say a thing.

myself in the middle of a fight, man.

It's all a blur.

And don't fucking poke
on me again, either.

No more excuses.

No more Iraqi stories.

You just got to learn
how to take a fall

because you owe me
a lot of fucking money.

Well, I can't pay you back
your money by taking a dive

in this nickel and dime bullshit.

You'd better figure out something
and figure it out quick.

Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.

Up in the Ramapos they got fights.

Don't talk to me about that.

It's not for you.

Why? I heard they're big money.

Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.

Like your father and brother.

This isn't a way for you
to make a living.

You're a good kid
with a good heart.

You can do a lot worse

than living your life

There's nothing wrong with it.

What'd you say?

Nothing wrong with

Yeah.

What do you call this,

Is that working for a living, huh?

Is it working for a living when
I carried my best friend's legs

under this arm, and the rest
of him under this arm?

I saw a fucking baby with
his fucking head cut off!

I saw a fucking pile of feet

in the middle of the street,
and I had to clean it up!

I gave my fucking life

That's not work?

What's it fucking done for me?!

That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?

No, you gotta trust
me when I tell you,

you don't want to set foot
in those mountains.

What is the big fucking deal?

The big fucking deal?

The big fucking deal is I've dealt
with these guys for a long time,

and when they don't get what

Yeah. You don't know.

Well, John, I don't really have

a lot of fucking options, man.

I can't fucking catch up

I'm trying to protect you!

Just fucking call them up,

And what's your name?
Rodney.

Just Rodney?

to jump in there with you...

and see who walks out.

We're standing so close,
I guess we could do it right now.


You gonna be a good boy
and take a dive,

like Petty said you would?

Or am I gonna have to
teach you a lesson?

No, he's good. He's good.

Teach me a lesson?
I gave you our word.

Yeah, teach you a lesson.

JOHN: Everything's good.

Let me hear you say it.

Teach me a lesson?

Yeah, isn't that
what we talked about?

Is this boy deaf?
No, no, it's...

You been hit too many times?

everything's good.


Hey, yeah.

I like this one.

He's tough.

JOHN: Plenty tough.

Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.

Now, why the hell you want
to come up here and fight,

or, hell, anywhere,

when you've been fighting
over there for so long?

I just need the money, man.

Mmm... Yeah.

Well... we all need money...

don't we, Petty?

So...

why don't me and John
discuss this deal

while you go put
your fight face on.

Didn't we just discuss the deal?

What, you think I was asking?

Hey! Don't! Keep your
fucking hands off him.

Just checking his reflexes.

You step out. Step out and we'll...

I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.


I should've popped
that motherfucker.

Well, that would be the last
motherfucker you ever popped.

Am I supposed to be scared of him
'cause he sucks on a lollipop?


You gotta make this look good.

You can't embarrass DeGroat

in front of these guys
that he's got coming up.

Well...

I can't promise to go down
for that motherfucker.

Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?!

Yeah. I heard you.
Good.

Now get your shit
and let's get going.

Come on, get ready.

You ain't fighting with

Be careful out there.

Keep it going for a little while

and then you know what to do.

Clean shot?

Yeah, right in the heart.

Inch either way, we'd be tracking

I said...

I think your left rear's gone down.

What shit you talking?


And our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.


Get that other one out.

Let's go. Go get him.

Get the fuck out. Come on.

MAN: Get your fucking ass...

(MEN GRUNTING)

(RODNEY GRUNTING)

(RODNEY CRIES OUT)

<i>RODNEY: "Russ...</i>

<i>I'm sorry about the other day.</i>

<i>I know you're looking out for me.</i>

<i>But you gotta understand
that I'm different</i>

<i>than I was before I left.</i>

<i>And I think that I always will be.</i>

<i>I can't explain how exactly.</i>

<i>My head is just full of stuff
and I can't get it out."</i>


Oh, man.


You should have kept
better company.

Don't look at me.


Look away.

Fuck you.

Oh, fuck you.

You fucking coward.

I don't care. I don't care.

(GUN FIRES)

Get some shovels.

<i>RODNEY: "But I'm gonna
turn things around.</i>

<i>I'm gonna do this one last fight
and then I'll be done.</i>

<i>Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt
or dig for coal</i>

<i>or I'll work with you
and Roach at the mill.</i>

<i>I'll do anything.</i>

<i>I'm gonna get things back on track.</i>

<i>I promise.</i>

<i>I love you, man.</i>

<i>I'll see you tomorrow
when I get back."</i>

(PAPER RUSTLING)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Morning, Russell.

Glad you're home.

Thanks.

(CLEARS THROAT)

I guess you, uh...

heard that, uh...

I stopped by to see Lena.

Yeah, I'm aware.

Not why I'm here.

<i>HARLAN: I said...</i>

<i>I think your left rear's gone down.</i>

<i>JOHN: What shit you talking?</i>

<i>HARLAN: I ain't talking shit.</i>

<i>And our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.</i>

<i>(GUNSHOT)</i>

Turn it off.
<i>- HARLAN: Get that other one out.</i>

We don't need to hear it again.

I've spoken to Jersey State,
Bergen County, Fish and Game.

All of them have dealt with this
Harlan DeGroat before.

The problem is that
the people up in those hills,

they don't cooperate.

Getting information from these
people is like pulling teeth.

It's a whole 'nother
world up in there.

Generations upon
generations of these people

never even come down
off that mountain.

Got their own breed of justice
and it does not include us.

Even the local police
sent in several squad cars,

but they haven't been able
to get nothing yet.

So you know that I'm stuck here
with my hands tied.

What the fuck does that mean?

That they aren't gonna...

do anything about this
or look for Rodney?

I did not say that, Russell.

I said that they're having
a difficult time

and I'm having jurisdiction issues.

But I'm gonna be
on it until it's done.

What the fuck?

Bud.
I mean, you know...

We know John Petty's dead.

I mean, Jesus, you know,

damn near hear him dying
on Dan's phone.

But Rodney might
still be out there.

I know that this is very hard

for you, but...

I do have a procedure
that I have to follow.

It sounds like there's
no procedure at all.

Bud!
No, no, no, no, no.

It sounds like they're not
doing a goddamn thing.

Now, either you're all
afraid to go in there...

or, uh...

you just don't give a shit.
You walking down the wrong road.

I said I'm into it,
and I said I'll handle it.

Don't make this personal.

You need to stay out of my business.
Stay out of your business.

Knock it off.
Stay out of your business.

You know what?
While I was away, it seems that

all that you was into
was my business.

So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.

Yeah, I got a problem with you.

WESLEY: I'm not the one who was out
drinking and driving.

Got locked up and had
to leave his woman alone

'cause of something I did,
a mistake I made.

And I don't know nothing
about what happened to Rodney.

Nothing at all. I'm just
trying to do my job.

And I'm giving you my word that
I'm gonna be on it until it's done.

Until it's done.

Mmm. Well.

Russell. Come on.

What is it?

You want me to show you out?

I'll be around.

Dan.

RED: Where you going now?
No, it's good.

Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
Hey.

I know how tough this is,
but I'm here to help anyway I can.

Then get me an address for DeGroat.

An address? How am I
gonna get that address?

Don't give me that shit, Dan. You know
as well as I do that John Petty has one.

Well, I don't...
I don't know.

Look, I'll see if I
can dig that up.

No, no, no, don't see
if you can dig it up.

Do it.
Russell, listen to me.

If you're smart,
you let these boys handle it.

I know these guys. This DeGroat
is a nasty son of a bitch.

You let me worry about...

who's a nasty son of a bitch.

We'll follow you.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)

Damn, looks like John still owes
money to these people.

A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal,

but I didn't realize
it was this big.

What deal?
Well, this bare-knuckle deal

up and down the Appalachians.

I don't know that much about it,
but my guess is,

Rodney went up there to fight.

Well, why didn't you just
say something to Wesley?

Well, I don't... I don't know.

I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.

John should've known better.

I think he did, Red,
but Rodney forced his hand.

He thought it was the only way
to pay off that debt.

I don't see DeGroat's address, but
I do know it's up in the Ramapos.

And, Russell, please
hear me when I tell you,

you'd be way better off letting
the authorities deal with him.

They're not doing
such a good job, Dan.

Well, I hear you,
but John hated dealing with them.

I'm surprised they haven't come
down here to get their money.

Money and drugs,
that's the only thing

that drove that crazy
son of a bitch.

Are you ready for this?

I guess so.

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

You watch your ass.

Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.

'66 or '67?

Man, you don't see
that Bolero red much.

You got the tuxedo black

and ash gold everywhere, but...

Yeah, this is sweet.

Three-ninety-six big block?

Yep.

That's a true 138 SS
right there, man.

Fucking rocket ship.

Well, I don't doubt it with
that Muncie four speed.

Hmm!

How long to restore it?

A couple years.

RUSSELL: A couple years? Worth it.

You got nitrous?

Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.

Yeah.

You know who's got any candy here?

What do you mean, "candy?"
You know what I mean.

Yeah.

You a fucking cop?


Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?

Who's the old man in the truck?

Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.

What you looking for, man?
Whatever you got. You know...

Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies,
crystals or pure.

It don't matter.
Wow, he knows his shit.

Yeah, we got some buzzard dust,
some critty up at the house.

All right.

We'll get you feelin' shitty,
my friend.

Good. All right, I'll follow you?

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Yo, it's Tiny.

You wait right here, all right?
All right.

All right.

Brought them boys out here
looking for some of the train.

MAN: Yo, if they got their
greenbacks, that's fine.

Come on up.

(DOG BARKING)

Who the fuck are you?

RUSSELL: I'm just passing through.

I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.

Well, I didn't ask who you were.

We just want to get high,
and our money's green.

Well, then you come
to the right place.

But I got to say, you got
some balls coming up in here,

not knowing nobody.

But if your money's green...

then it's all good.

That's pure glass.

Fire it up.

Looks good to me. How much?

Nah, fire that shit up.

It'll blow your balls off, brother.

I told you, I'm good. How much?

(THROATY GRUNT)



RUSSELL: You don't know, um...

Harlan DeGroat, do you?

Is that a joke?

Why would I joke about that?

'Cause this is his house.

He around?

I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.

All right.


Not now. We'll come by later.

Yo!

You forgot this.

RED: Oh, Shit.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Put your hands where
I can see 'em, gentlemen.

Russell Baze?

That's right.

Chief Barnes from
the North Braddock Police

alerted us early this evening
that you were up here.

You're lucky I got here when I did.

If the locals knew
why you were here,

they'd zip you up and you'd
be leaving in a body bag.

Do I need to ask if you're
carrying concealed weapons?

No, sir.

No, sir.
All right.

Then, given that you're an ex-con,

likely carrying concealed weapons,
you have a choice.

Either I arrest you now or
I follow you to the state line.

With respect, officer,
my brother might be up here,

and I ain't leaving without him.

I'll only do Chief
Barnes a favor once.

You return and I'll
arrest you on the spot.

There's nothing you can do
from inside a jail cell.

Am I making myself clear,
gentlemen?

Yes, sir, you are.

All right.
Then I'll follow you out.

That boy was always troubled.

Ever since he was a little kid.

You could see it in his eyes.

Especially after your mama died.

<i>(BOYS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)</i>

(DOORS SHUTTING, ENGINES STARTING)

Hey, Russell.

Wesley.

I just heard
from the Jersey police.

They found your brother.

He's dead.

OK.

A hunter's dog dug him up.

(VOICE FADING SLOWLY) Sorry.

They just called me.

The coroner's gonna
examine his body.

him back by the weekend.

(NO AUDIO)

Place is really hard to locate.

The roads are all mostly trails.

Let me go talk to him.
LENA: No, no, no. I got it.

LENA: It's OK.
Yeah?

(FAUCET RUNNING,
UTENSILS AND DISHES CLINKING)

You hardly touched your food.

RUSSELL: I ate enough.

I appreciate you coming over.

I wanted to.
Mmm.

We wanted to.

I'm sorry about Rodney.

I'm really sorry.

He was put through a lot, you know?

And so have you.

But please don't do anything.

OK?

You already tried.

You're lucky you
got out of there alive.

Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.

He's a good man, Russell.

You want me to take it?
No, I got it.

OK.

(SCRAPING PLATE)

We may not have the...

the fire and the flame...

but we got something good.

You know?

Can we put this behind us?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Thanks for dinner.
Mm-hmm.

You ready?

Let's go.

Get down on the ground!

Get down!



(GRUNTS, EXHALES)

The guy was expecting us.

Ooh, yeah!

Yeah! Yeah!

OK.

Every time, it's just...


<i>MAN:
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.</i>

<i>Forgive me my sins.</i>

The sins of my youth...

the sins of my age,
the sins of my soul...

the sins of my body.

My idle sins...

my serious voluntary sins...

the sins I know, the sins
we have concealed for so long...

<i>which are now
hidden from my memory.</i>

<i>My Jesus, forget and forgive
what we have been.</i>

<i>Amen.</i>

Hey! Hey, Baze!

Russell! Come back!

Russell!

What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.

Wesley told me not to
let anybody back here.

Give it up, please.
Dan, where's that ledger?

Huh?

DAN: You can't be here.

Where's that ledger, Dan?

Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.

This it?
Russell, don't.

You can stay if you want.
I don't want any part of it.

(CROWD CLAMORING IN DISTANCE)

(CLAMOR CONTINUES)

<i>HARLAN: What?</i>

Harlan DeGroat?

Who wants to know?

<i>I've taken over
John Petty's accounts.</i>

Who's this?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

<i>I'm willing to settle his debt.</i>

<i>And we can keep this deal going.</i>

Who the fuck is this?

It don't matter.

You come to Braddock...

the money's yours.

How the fuck did you get my number?

<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

Hey, we're closed.

Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

Why don't you get your fat
fucking ass in the kitchen,

fix me up a salmon burger?

See what that bitch
has in the register.

What do you say, Dan?

(TRAIN RUMBLING PAST)

You look fit.
Well, thanks.

Staying out of trouble?
Yeah, trying.

Yeah, I know what you mean.


So, uh...

I hear you might have
some money for me.

Who, me?
(CLEARS THROAT NERVOUSLY)

You, somebody.

No, not me. No.

Well, do you know where
Petty keeps his money?

Uh, no... Petty, you know, he...

he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.

Well, you just tend bar
from all the way back here?

Well, I'm just...
That's a good trick, Dan.

(GRUNTING WITH EFFORT)

So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?

I don't know,
honest to God, I don't.

I swear to God, I don't know.

You swear to God?
Yeah.

Well, if you're invoking
a deity over this,

I guess I'm mistaken.

Yeah.
Mmm.

HARLAN: A long way to drive, Dan.

Shoot

(BOTH GRUNT)

I didn't come five hours...
DAN: I don't know!

...to not get my fucking money!
(DAN YELLS IN PAIN)

HARLAN: Show me where that safe is.

DAN: OK, OK!

OK, I'll do it.

OK, all right.

Get that fucker open right now.

Wait, I gotta remember
the combination.

Julie, call 911.
DAN: Wait a sec, I'm trying.

I just need another number...
HARLAN: Three.

...one more number, wait...
Two.

DAN: Just give me a second so
I can remember the numbers!

Time's up, Dan.
DAN: Wait!

HARLAN: Open it!
Wait! One more number.

Oh, God, thank God.

HARLAN: It's empty.

You kidding me?

Where's my fucking money?
