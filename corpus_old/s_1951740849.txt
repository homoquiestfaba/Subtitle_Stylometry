[Siren Wailing]

[ Young Man Narrating]
The first time I saw a movie
at the Cinémathèque Française...

I thought, "Only the French--

Only the French would house
a cinema inside a palace. "

The movie was
Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor.

Its images were so powerful,
it was like being hypnotized.

I was 20years old.
It was the late '60s...

and I'd come to Paris
for a year to study French.

But it was here
that I got my real education.

[ Scream i ng ]

I became a member ofwhat in those days
was kind ofa free masonry.

A free masonry ofcinephiles...

what we'd call "film buffs. "

I was one ofthe insatiables...

the ones you'd always find
sitting closest to the screen.

Why do we sit so close?

Maybe it was because we wanted
to receive the images first...

when they were still new,
still fresh...

before they cleared the hurdles
ofthe rows behind us...

before they'd been relayed back
from row to row, spectator to spectator...

until worn-out, secondhand,
the size ofa postage stamp...

it returned to the
projectionist's cabin.

Doctor, I 'm not nuts!
I 'm here from the paper! I 'm a plant!

Maybe, too, the screen
really was a screen.

It screened us...
from the world.

But there was one evening
in the spring of 1 968...

when the world finally
burst through the screen.

[ Man # 1 Speaking French ]
The pawn ofan obscure coalition...

ofdubious interests...

the Mi nister Mal raux
has driven...

Henri Langlois out
ofthe French Cinematheque.

[ Speaking French ]
...if offered us all
a free and fair conception...

of French film culture.

[Man #1 Speaking French ]
Now, forbureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch-enemies...

have seized this bastion
ofliberty.

Resist them!

Liberty isn't given!
[ Man # 1 ] It's taken!

[ Man #2 ]
All those who love film...

[ Man # 1 ] In France...
[ Man #2 ]And abroad.

[ Man # 1 ]
...are with you.

And with Henry Langlois!

[ Young Man ]
It was Henri Langlois,
who created the Cinémathèque...

and it was because
he liked to show movies...

instead ofletting them rot
in some underground vault...

to show any movies--
good, bad, old, new...

silents, Westerns, thrillers--

that all the New Wave filmmakers
came here to learn their craft.

This was where
modern cinema was born.

[ Man #2 ]
What lies behind it?

The pol ice!

[ Young Man ]
Langlois had been sacked
by the government...

and it seemed like every film buff
in Paris had turned out in protest.

It was our very own
cultural revolution.

It was our very own
cultural revolution.

[ Speaki ng French ]
Excuse me.

[ Speaki ng French ]
Can you remove this?

It's stuck to my lips.

Can you remove my cigarette?
It's stuck.

[ Speaking French ]
Yes, yes...

of course.

Sorry.

[ Speaking English ] What areyou, English?
No. I'm American.

You can put it out now.

What'syourname?
Matthew.

You're here a lot, aren't you?
Butyou never talk to anyone.

We've been wondering
whyyou're always alone.

I don't really know anybody.

How comeyou're
chained to the gates?

I'm not chained
to the gates.

You're awfully clean.
What?

For someone who likes
the cinema so much.

Doyou knowJacques?
-Jacques?

"Ifshit could shit,
itwould smell just likeJacques."

My brother's
gone to talk to him.

When he gets back,you'll be able
to smell Jacques on him.

It's like
being around pigs.

You speak English reallywell.
What?

You speak English reallywell.
My mother's English.

Here's Theo. When I introduce
you,just give him a sniff.
Come on.

[ Speaking French ]
Truffaut, Godard, Charbol, Rivette...

and Renoir,Jean Rouch,
Rohmerare here.

Signoret,Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

Marcel Carne too.

Whyis Carne here?

What should we do?
Stay or leave?

I don't know.

[ Speaking English ]
Theo, this is Matthew.

You were right. He's American.
Hi.

I've seen you around. You've been coming
to all the Nicholas Rays.

Yeah. I really like his movies.

What? TheyLive ByNight?
Mm-mm. More like...

JohnnyGuitar
and Rebel Without a Cause.

You know what Godard wrote about him?
No. What?

"Nicholas Ray is cinema."

[ Chuckles ]
[ French ] What's up with you?
[ Sniffing ] Me?

[ Speaking French ]
Come on, stickwith me!

[ Speaking French ]
Fascists!

Bastards!
Assholes!

[Police Siren Wailing]

[Matthew Narrating]
And that was how I first met
Theo and Isabelle.

I could hear myheart pounding.

I don't know ifit was
because I'djust been chased by the police...

or because I was already
in love with my new friends.

As we walked and talked
and talked and talked...

about politics, about movies...

and why the French could
never come close to producing
a good rock band--

I 'm starvi ng.
I forgot the sandwiches.

I didn't want that night
ever to end.

Merci.
Didn't you bring anything?

No. I'm okay.
Please eat.

Don't mind me.

No. I'm really not hungry.
I've broken it now. Take it.

You're very kind, but I don't--
For goodness sake,
take it when you're offered it.

Thankyou.

Theo, don'tyou have
something for Matthew?
This is fine.

I gave him a third of mine.
Okay.

[ Chuckles ]

Really, I didn't come here
to eatyour sandwiches.
He doesn't want it.

Yes, he does! He's just too polite
to say he does.

Aren'tyou, Matthew?
You're very kind.

So where areyou from exactly?
San Diego.

What aboutyou two?
Wereyou both born in Paris?

I entered this world on
the Champs Elysées, 1 959.

[ Speaking French ]
The pavement ofthe Champs-Elysees.

[ Speaking English ]
And you know what
myvery first words were?

No. What?

"New York Herald Tribune!"

New York Herald Tribune!

New York Herald Tribune!
New York Herald Tribune!

[ Speaking French ]
Willyou come to Rome with me?

Here! Ri ght here! Here!

[ Speaking French ]
No, there!

[ Speaking English ] Good night, Matthew!
Night.

?? [MatthewSinging]

?? [ Humming ]

[ Matthew ]
"Dear Mom...

"I've gotsome realnews this time.

I just met
my first French friends."

[Telephone Ringing]

[Ringing Continues ]

Hello.
Matthew?

Who is this?

Don't be suspicious. It's me.
Theo?

Don't tell me I woke you up.
No, I--

I've been up for ages.
You don't sound as if
you've been up for ages.

I always sound like this
in the morning.

Sorry. I had to call you early
because I go to class at 9:00.

Right.
Listen, you want to have
dinner tomorrow night?

Um, you mean like a real dinner
in a nice restaurant?

No, not in a restaurant.
Here at home.

Yeah, I'd--
Sure, that'd be great.

Yes? Okay, why don't you--

Theo, please get offthe phone.
It's 9:00.

Yes,yes. Whydon'tyou
meet us fora drink first
at Le Raspail, 6:00?

You know where it is?

Boulevard Saint-Germain?
Be there are 6:00.

Hey!

[ Speaking French ] Third floor!
[ Repeats In French ]

You know, there's room
in here forall ofus.

[ Speaking French ]
Theo and I are contagious!
[ Speaking French ] What?

We're very contagious!
Contagious?

[ Speaking French ]
You mustn't catch us.

[ Speaking French ] It's beautiful.
You think so?

[ Speaking French ]
Good luck.

[ Panting ]

[ Speaking French ]
Evening, Maman.

[Speaking French ]
What areyou doinghere?

We're here for dinner.
What?

With Matthew.

Didn't Isabelle say?
Which Matthew?

[Speaking English ]
This Matthew.

He's our new friend.
Matthew, this is my mother.

Hi.
Very pleased to meet you, Matthew.

Likewise.
Oh, you're American, are you?

Yeah. I'm from California.
Oh.

Matthew lives in that nasty student
Hotel Malebranche...

so we invited him to dinner.
Oh.

[ Speaking French ]
What's wrong?

What can I say, Isabelle?
I'm cooking for two...

and now there are
five of us.

Didn't Theo
tell you?

No, he didn't.
And neither did you.

Haveyou got mashed potatoes
for brains orwhat?

You were supposed
to tell her!

You're crazy!
[ Squealing ]

Bitch, cow, slut--

[ Speaking English ]
Oh, for God's sake!
Put a sock in it, you two!

I must apologize for
my children's behavior, Matthew.

No. I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

Please don't putyourself out
on account ofme.

That's very sweet ofyou,
seeing as you're completely blameless.

Let me look atyou.

Okay. I wantyou to make
a good impression on Papa.

[Speaking French ]
Papa, it's me.

We're eating in.

And the cinematheque?

Closed until further
notice.

[ Speaking English ]
Papa, can't you see we have a guest?

This is Matthew.
Oh.

Sir.
Matthew.

Matthew's dining
with us tonight.

Myyoung Matthew,
inspiration is like a baby.

It does not choose a nice,
seemly hour to enter the world.

It has no consideration
for the poor poets. I know.

But when it does come...

when it deigns to come,
then you know it's--

Young man, I was speaking toyou.
I imagineyou were listening.

I was.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

What?

Nothing.
I was just, um--

You seemed to be mesmerized
by this tin lighter.

I'd like to know why.

Well?
George, please.

Matthew's our guest.
No, no. I'm genuinely curious.

I'd like to know why.

I was just-- I was fidgeting
with Isabelle's lighter...

and... I wasn't
really realizing it...

then I noticed,
and I thought it was rude...

so I put it down
on the table.

But I put it diagonally across
one ofthese squares.

Doyou see?

Look.

That's when I noticed
that the lighter's length...

is exactly the same length
as the diagonal itself.

So I put it lengthwise,
along the outside edge.

Look. It fits there too.
Yeah.

But it fits there.

And it fits like this
and like this...

and this way too.

And I betyou if
Ijustsplit it in half...

you know, it's
got to fitsomewhere.

I mean, it really
fits anywhere. Look.

See?

I was noticing that the more
you look at everything--

this table, the objects on it,
the refrigerator, this room...

-your nose, the world--
[Isabelle Chuckles ]

suddenly...

you realize that there's some
sort ofcosmic harmony...

of shapes and sizes.

I was just wondering why.
I don't know why that is.

I know that it is.

You have an interesting
friend here.

More interesting, I suspect,
than you know.

I mean, when we look around us,
what is it we see?

[ French ]
Complete chaos.

Yet viewed from above...

viewed, as it were,
by God...

everything suddenly
fits together.

My children believe that
their demonstrations and sit-ins...

and happenings...

what, they believe that these possess
the capacity...

not only to provoke society,
but also to transform it.

What is ityou're saying?
If Langlois is dismissed,
we shouldn't do anything?

Ifimmigrants are deported,
ifstudents are beaten up,
we shouldn't do anything?

What I'm saying is that
a little luciditywould not go amiss.

So, uh,
everyone's wrongbutyou?

In France, in Italy,
Germany, America?

Listen to me, Theo.
Beforeyou can change the world...

you must realize
you yourself are part ofit.

You cannot stand outside
looking in.

You're the one
who stands outside.

You're the onewho refused to sign
a petition against theVietnam War.

Poets don't sign petitions.
They sign poems.

A petition is apoem.

Yes! And a poem is a petition.
Thankyou, but I'm not gaga yet.

I don't need you to remind me
of my own work!

Hmm?
That's right.

[ Speaking French ] A petition is a poem,
a poem is a petition.

[ English ] Yes.
Those are the most famous
lines you everwrote.

And now look atyou.

[ Speaking French ]
I hope I'll never be like him.

Theo.

[Speaking English ]
Weshouldsaygoodnight, darling.

We got a long day
ahead ofus tomorrow.

George.

[ Speaking French ]
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

[Speaking French ]
We should go to bed.

You had something
to tell the children, didn't you?

Yes, of course.

I'm sorry.

The cheques
are on the mantelpiece.

Don't cash them
until you need them, all right?

[ Speaking English ]
Good night, everybody.

[ Speaking French ]
Good night, Papa. Have a safe journey.

Good night, dear.
Theo.

[ Speaking English ]
A very good night toyou, Matthew.

It was a pleasure meeting you, sir.
A pleasure.

Very nice meeting you, Matthew.
You too.

Thankyou so much for dinner.
It's my pleasure.

Why don'tyou invite Matthew
to spend the night?

I'm not sure I like the sound
of Hotel Malebranche.
[ Chuckles ]

[ Speaking French ]
Good night.

[Clicks Lighter]

Why haven'tyou dazzled us
with these philosophical
speculations ofyours?

I didn't know I was being philosophical.
Papa was awfully impressed.

Papa's full ofshit.
[Matthew] I thinkyou're lucky.

I-- I wish my parents
were that nice.

Otherpeople's parents
are always nicerthan our own.

And yet for some reason,
our own grandparents...

are always nicer
than other people's.

You know, that's true.
That's-- That's absolutely true.

I never thought about it before,
but it's-- it's true.

Matthew,yousweet--

This...

is double the length of--

Well, I'm for bed.

Areyou staying?

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

Good night, Matthew.

Everybody's got a father.

Yes.

But the fact that
God doesn't exist...

doesn't mean
he can take his place.

[ Sighs ]
[ Laughs ]

?? [Rock Guitar]

Okay?

[ Chuckles ]
That's fine.

Good night.
Good night.

Seeyou in the morning.
Seeyou.

Thank--
[DoorCloses ]

Thankyou.

?? [Woman Singing Blues Rock]

No!

?? [Ends ]

[ Engine Starts ]

Good morning.

What was that all about?

I was removing the sleep
from your eyes.

Theo lets me do his
every morning.

That's the strangest thing
to want to do.

Didn'tyou enjoy it?

Was I supposed to?
Naturally.

Up, up, up, up, up!
What areyou waiting for?

Isabelle,
I'm not dressed.

What areyou doing?
What areyou doing?

I've been memorizing this room.

In the future, in my memory...

[Both ]
Ishalllive a great dealin this room.

Queen Christina...

where Greta Garbo
bids farewell to the room...

where she spent the night
with John Gilbert.

Bravo!
[Applauds ]

Alors.
We have a private wing to ourselves.

The bathroom's
at the end ofthe corridor.

Ifyou aren't there in one minute,
we're coming back to getyou!

[Theo Speaking French ]
Come in.

[ Speaking French ]
Good morning.

[ Speaking English ]
Areyou going to church?
[ Chuckles ]

Oh, sorry. You want to use
my toothbrush?

Uh, no.
Sure?

I'll use my finger.


Sleep well?
Yeah.

I mean, fine.
Good.

You know, Matthew?
Hmm.

You really do have the most
beautiful pair oflips.

Can I touch them?

You-- You wanna touch my lips?
Uh-huh.

Okay.

So red... and ripe
and luscious.

So sullen, brutal.

Let's see what you
look like with lipstick.

I really should be going.
You'd make such a pretty girl.

Ignore her, Matthew.
She sucks in all the airaroundher.

No, I-- I really have to, um,
be getting back to my hotel.

No. Why? You have been
invited to stay.

Really?
Sure.

You know ourparents
have left.

They're going to be
introuvés for a month.

We thoughtyou might like
to moveyour things here.

R-Really?
Sure.

But you just met me two days ago.
You barely even know me.

This way we get to know you. You
don't have to stay in a hotel, do you?

No.
Then we'll go and
pick up whatyou need...

with myMobilette, okay?

Come on.
But... what about you?

It was my idea.

[ Matthew ]
Whoa! You're scaring me right now!

[ Theo Laughs ]

Jesus.

I'm going to check out
the Cinémathèque,just in case.

Okay.
Don't take too long.

Don't worry, I won't.
I don't have much stuff.

With us, you're not
going to need much.

Okay.

Oh,just don't forget
your toothbrush!

Okay.

"DearMom, I guessyou're surprised
to be hearing from me...

"so soon after my last letter.

"But I've just moved out of my hotel
and into an apartment...

"belonging to a famous
French author...

"whose children are the same age as me
and have the same interests.

"I knowhowpleasedyou'llbe
to hearI'm getting in with
the right kindofpeople.

Sayhello to Father.
I hope he's not still mad at me. "

Listen to this, Matthew.

Listen to this, Matthew.

"The difference between
Keaton and Chaplin...

"is the difference
between prose and poetry...

"between the aristocrat
and the tramp...

"between eccentricity
and mysticism...

between man as a machine
and man as animal."

[ Speaking French ]
Not bad, huh?

That's good. Except for me,
there's no comparison.

Why? 'Cause Chaplin's
incomparable?

No. Because Keaton
is incomparable.

Keaton? You think Keaton's
greater than Chaplin?

Absolutely I do.
Oh,you're notserious.

Of course I am.
You're crazy.

Come on. In the firstplace,
you can't denythat Keaton's
funnierthan Chaplin.

Yes, I can.
You don't think that Keaton
is funnier than Chaplin?

I don't think anyone's funnier than Chaplin.
Keaton is!

Even when he's not
doing anything, he's funny.
Andhe looks like Godard.

Keaton is a real filmmaker.
Chaplin, all he cares about
is his own performance...

his own ego.
That's bul lshit.

I t's not bullshit.
Yes, it is.

YouAmericans understand fuck-all
aboutyour own culture.

No wonderyou never got
the point ofJerry Lewis.
Don't even get me started!

Listen, when Chaplin wanted
to have a beautiful shot, he knew how.

Better than Keaton,
better than anybody.

You remember the last shot
of CityLights?

He looks at the flower girl,
she looks at him...

anddon't forget,
she'dbeen blind...

so she was seeing him
forthe veryfirst time.

It's as if, through her eyes,
we also see him for the very first time.

Charlie Chaplin, Charlot,
the most famous man in the world...

and it's as ifwe've never
really seen him before.

[ Resetting Turntable ]

I sa, ifyou play that fucki ng record again,
I 'll break it in two, okay?

But you like
Janis Joplin.

Stop it!

I said stop it, Isabelle!
[ Yelps ]

[ Speaking French ]
Stop!

Wha-What?

Name a film--
Let go!

Name a film where someone
tap dancing drives someone else crazy!

Oh, I know this!
Come on! Quick! Quick!

Top Hat! Top Hat!

[Stomping Continues ]

I'm right.

[ Speaking French ]
He's good.

[ Speaking French ]
You know what I'm thinking?

What?

"Bande à part. "

[Theo ]
You're right.

[ Speaking English ]
Why areyou two
looking at me like that?

Well,yousee,
mylittle Matthew...

there's something Theo and I have
been meaning to do for a long time...

but we've been waiting
for the right person to do it with.

And I thinkyou're finally it!
To do what?

Tryto be the record
ofBande à part.

What record?
You've seen Bande à part, haven't you?

Yeah.
Remember the scene where the three
race through the Louvre?

Uh, vaguely. Remind me.
Theytryto beat the world record...

of 9 minutes and 45 seconds.
Oh, yeah! Of course.

We're going to beat
their record.

Uh, oh.

What?
What's the matter?

Nothing, really, I'm--
Not afraid, areyou?

No. I'm not afraid.
What, then?

It's easy foryou two. I'm an American,
whatyou French call an alien.

So?
So ifl get caught, I get deported.

Well, don't worry, little man,
we're not going to get caught.

Yeah,you don't knowthat.
Theyweren't caught in Bande à part.

And ifwe beat their record--
It's a movie!

Go get Papa's stopwatch.
It's a great idea, but--

Matthew, this is a test.

Areyou going to pass it
or fail it?

Be careful. A lot depends
on howyou answer.

Hé! Non!Arrêtez!

[ Shouting ]

[ Laughing ]

Nine minutes
and 28 seconds.

We beat the record
by 1 7 seconds!

[ Laughing ]

Matthew!
My little Matthew!

You were wonderful!

We accept him. One ofus!
One of us!

[ Isabelle And Theo ]
We accept him, one of us!

That's Mama.

I'm too wet to answer.

[ Speaking English ]
Isa's smart, but she doesn't
know how to deal with parents.

What doyou mean?
I mean, it's not enough to ignore them.

They should all be arrested...

put on trial,
confess their crimes...

sent to the country
for self-criticism...

and reeducation!

They're already in the country.
They are at the seaside.

[ Speaking French ]
That's different.

Allô. Allô?

[ Speaking French ]
Too bad.

Myparents nevergo anywhere.

At least you have
the house to yourselves.

Where are you going?

Uh, I gotta get
out ofthese clothes.

It'll be cold in your room.
Come into mine.

Okay.
?? [Big Band]

You can wearthis.

Thanks.

I'm going to get a Coca.
You want one?

Okay.

Matthew!
Yeah!

Just open the door. My hands are full.
-J ust a second.

Why didn't you open the door?
I was--

I was dressing.

?? [ Isabelle Humming]

What film?

I n what film does a chorus line
dance like this...

with a singer
in a fur coat?

I've seen this film?
We saw it together.

We did? Give me a clue.
Certainly not.

Come on. Be a sport. Director's name.
No.

Number ofwords in the title.

I said no. Non!
Isabelle!

The first letter ofthe first word.
God! You're pathetic.

Isn't he pathetic, Matthew?
Don't you think he's pathetic?

Matthew, I bet you know.
Don't you dare help him.

Did the Sphinx
give Oedipus a clue?

Fuckyou.
?? [ Hums ]

Give up?

Yeah.

Blonde Venus. Marlene Dietrich. 1 932.
[ Speaking French ] Shit.

I knewthat.

Forfeit.
Ifyou insist.

I dareyou to do now...

in front of us...

what I've watched you do...
in front ofher.

Who?

I don't know
whatyou're talking about.

Oh, yes, you do, my pet.

[ Chuckles ]
Forfeit.

What a bitchyou are.

A bitch and a sadist.

Are you going to pay
the forfeit or not?

Verywell.

Mm-mm-mm. I wantyou to do it
the wayyou did it...

when you thought
no one was watching.


[Theo Grunts ]

[ Grunts ]



Let's have a drink.
I'll meetyou downstairs.

Matthew.
Yes?

Yes.

[Theo ] Whydon'tyou admit
you were thrilled?

Come on.
You can tell me.

What?

Weren't you just
a tiny bit excited?

What is it exactly
you're trying to get me to say?
I asked you a question.

Well, I suppose you know
who you sound like.

Who?
Isabelle.

Why not?
She's my twin sister.

You two are twins?
Yes.

She'd be me
if she were a man.

That's crap. You're not identical.
Yes, we are.

We're Siamese twins,
joined here.

You're a strange one, Theo.

Half an hour ago, I sawyou look at her
as though you wanted to strangle her.

I did.

I don't understand you.

Don'tyou have any brothers or sisters?
I have two older sisters.

Didn'tyou ever
want to strangle them?

Of course I did! But I never masturbated
in front ofthem, and I never--

They never forced me to do
anything I neverwanted to do.

You think Isabelle
forced me, doyou?

[Matthew Narrating]
Deep down I knew things
couldn't go on as before.

Now the stakes had been raised.

But for a while, at least, there
did seem to be a kind oftruce
between Theo and Isabelle.

And then one evening--

[ Wheezi ng ]
Theo!

[ Wheezi ng Conti nues ]

[ Coughing, Gasping]

What film?
[ Isabelle ] "What film?"

Name a film where a cross
marks the spot of a murder,
or pay the forfeit.

You too, Matthew.
Me?

What-- What have I done?

Name a film
or pay the forfeit.

Uh, um--
Time's up.

Time's up? You didn't
even give me a chance.
The film?

Scarface.
Howard Hawks, 1 932.

And the forfeit?

Well, now...

as you know, Isabelle,
I'm not a sadist.

I just want to see everyone happy,
no one left out.

So I'd likeyou...

and Matthew...

to make love
in front of me.

But not in here.

I don't fancy sleeping in someone
else's revolting sweat.

No offense, Matthew.
Where?

In the spare room...

in front of
the Delacroix.

Maybe one reproduction
will inspire another.

Um, um--
I won't do it.

Won't do it?
You wouldn't.

Matthew
isn't my type.

Okay.

??[Continues]

I gotta go to the bathroom.

??[Continues, Indistinct]

Matthew! Matthew.

?? [ Continues, Indistinct ]

Matthew.

Matthew.

Yes?

This is silly.
Come out of there.

Okay.

[ Yells ]

[ Yells ]
Okay. All right.

Look. Wait. Look.
You're hurting me!

I'm not violent. I'm--
I'm against violence.

I'm not gonna resist. Look.
So shut up. Okay?

Okay.
Now, Matthew, you aren't
being very gallant.

Is the prospect of making love to me
so hateful?

I've seen you.
I sawyou in bed together.

Oh. Our guest
has been spying on us.

Hmm. Now, that wasn't
a friendly thing to do, Matthew.

Especiallywhen we've
been so hospitable.

Okay, okay. Look--

Shh, shh.
I'm not resisting! I'm not resisting!

[ Gasps, Laughs ]

Oh, how sweet
ofyou, Matthew...

to keep myimage
next toyourheart.

I didn't mean--
[Isabelle Laughing]

Good.
[ Laughs ]

Oh, Matthew. Oh, come on.
Oh, wake up. Oh.

Come on, wake up.

Isabelle?

[ Laughs ]
No. I'm Theo.

[ Chuckles ]
Where is Isabelle?

You have to help me.

[ Loud Moaning ]

Sorry.

[ Moaning Continues ]

[Siren Wailing]

[Moaning Continues ]

[ Moaning Intensifies ]

[ People Shouting,
Whistles Blowing ]

[ Siren Wailing ]

[ Isabelle Sobbing ]

[ Grunting, Moaning ]

[ Sighs, Chuckles ]

Oh, thatwas the best one.

What aboutyesterday?

Where?
In Papa's study.

You thought
thatwas better?

Mm-hmm. Please, please,
please, please.

What?
Stay inside.

Matthew.
