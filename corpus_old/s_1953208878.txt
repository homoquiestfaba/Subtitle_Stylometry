We really need to get an elevator.

That's why we have fire poles.

Yeah, but you know Cap...

last time I checked, that was
more of a one way only deal.

You know, kind of directional.

Is there any thing you need, Kayden?

Right, we need your... digital camera.

Does it have anything to do with...

for a silly girl named...

J.C.?

It's not that silly.

No...

Well, like she says, who says you
can't be sexy and save lives?

Hey Cap! You mind?

[??]

Wooo!

No, no, no. I'm the best friend,
I'll take the pictures. Thank you.

Make sure you get my good side, OK?

Does she have a bad side?

No.

Hey, did you guys see
last year's winner?

Oh, yeah. Right.

Here, here, give me the damn thing.
Let me take the picture.

Stop it! Stop!

Go! Go!

OK. Hold on.

You looking good, girl!

You're gonna win this year, for sure.

Thanks for the support.

Your welcome.

So, do you think he's gonna
pop the question tonight?

I dunno. I hope so.

Well, if he doesn't do it soon...
I'm gonna marry you.

Give me a hug.

Ohhhh, thanks girl, I'll see you.

I'll see you at work. Bye.

I wanna drive you to work.

Did you catch that fight last night?

No man, I had to...

It's a good thing because
your boy got knocked out!

Please!

About time. Did you get my coffee?

Yeah, right.

So what's the deal?

Has he asked you yet?

Not yet. But I think he's about to.

You are so lucky. Manuel
is such a great catch!

You think?

So this isn't a fire call. What is it?

So there's the 411.

Seems some people downtown
are not happy with

his plans to buy this
property from the city.

To turn downtown into uptown.

Turns out, they got the groundbreaking
ceremony this Saturday.

Here on this very lot.

Piece of cake.

Got your ears on buddy?

What?

Very funny.

Looking good. Hey.

With all the chicks watching,
make us look good, huh?

Your now in the kill zone.

What do you see?

I can't see shit!

Oh shit!

What do you got?

We got to talk. Really.

There are 2.

Hal, we got a nice set here.

Ply or block? Block.

Piece of cake.

Wait. Hold on.

Hold one sec. What do you got coach?

We got a secondary.

Primaries were a decoy.

These are the real bad boys.

[Dramatic music]

Think it's time we got a new TV set.

Right there, right there!

Announcer on TV: An unfortunate
industrial explosion

took the life of a lone
firefighter earlier this week.

Cash Gates says that this will not be a
setback in his development projects.

Fuck that guy!

Next time he can defuse
the bomb himself.

What? What did I say?

Oh, Kayden.

The psychological
examiner is here for you.

For me, huh?

For all of us. It's routine
after a tragedy like this.

What to be harassed?

Why can't they just leave us alone?
Let us do our jobs?

Because they can't. They
have to do their jobs.

That means evaluate. She's in
my office waiting for you.

Mr. Gates.

Is there something I can help you with?

Hello Captain. You remember
my assistant Becky?

I can remember lots of things Mr. Gates.

Cash. Please. My friends call me Cash.

So what is it you need, Mr... Gates?

I was just taking this
opportunity to familiarize Becky

with some of the changes
needed to this property.

Once my firm acquires it.

I see.

And, are your certain that your firm
is acquiring the firehouse property?

Captain, your property and one other...

are the only 2 left to complete the

monopoly of property
needed for my project.

I see. But the city owns this property.

The city, Captain, wants money.

And they have accepted my
proposal for purchase.

Everything has its price, Captain.

You of all people
should understand that.

So this is about money, huh?

This is about progress.

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
see you standing there.

Maybe you'll be in it this year.

It's gonna be me. It's gonna be my year.
She only beat me by 2 votes.

I know. I voted for her.

So guess what I just overheard
in the engine room?

I'm listening.

That's it. We just gonna
sell the property?

Shut us down?

Well, maybe the city opens
a new fire station.

Or worse, maybe they
shut us down for good

and we get reassigned
to new locations.

You mean we won't all be together?

Not usually, Riley.

What if I get reassigned to Antarctica?

Oh, goody! You can go
see your mom and dad!

I'm from Austria! Not Antarctica.

Oh. I keep forgetting. Good day mate!

This is serious you guys. I for one
don't want to be looking for a new job.

Listen Kayden. I'm here for you.

But if you don't open,
up I can't help you.

You don't even know me.

And here you are...
trying to evaluate me.

I'm not trying to evaluate you Kayden.

Are we done here?

Of course. This is strictly
voluntary, and not required.

When you wanna talk, I'm here.

How you holding up, girl?

Psychobabble bitch says to
be positive and stay strong.

She's right, Kay.

You need to be strong not
only for yourself...

but for the team...

Manuel.

It's easy for you to say.

You've always been a leader.

Everyone looks up to you.

I'm here for you.

You know... you guys and this
firehouse are all I have left now.

Kay!

There's something I gotta tell you.

Captain. Not now!

You have 45 seconds!

Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go!

3...2...1...[whistle blows]

Not even close!

No where near good enough.

OK. Everyone again!

[Whistle blows]

Ughh!

We can't just sit on our butts
and let them take our building!

Our jobs. We gotta raise the money
ourselves to save our building.

Tommy! I have some time for you
now if you're still interested.

Yeah! Fun time!

OK sure. But what can we do? How
can we raise that kind of money?

Last time I checked, saving
lives was free of charge.

We're firefighters!

If we can save lives, we can
certainly save this building.

I have an idea!

[Rap song]

So I... pretty much feel
that I've been this way...

or I mean the way that I am
for as long as I can remember.

I see. Well...

please, go on, as long
as you feel comfortable.

OK.

I can remember as far back as my
first sexual crush that I had...

on my Mom's friend.

Boy, she was something to look at!

She had really big boobs. I mean...

I mean... Can I say that?
I mean boobs.

Go on. Go on, Tom. I'm listening.

Yeah, her name was Jill.

I fact she was around so much, that
my mom had me calling her Aunty Jill.

Boy! Aunty Jill!

And then there was this babysitter.

She was older too.

I was like, fifteen at the time.

This was right around the time that I
discovered that I loved masturbating.

In fact, I would try to get
caught by the babysitter.

Hoping she would catch me with my pants
around my ankles, pulling on my dick.

I can't believe I'm telling you this!

I see. So what you're saying is...

or what you're
trying to tell me is...

you have an infatuation
with authority figures.

OK. Is that what I'm saying?

Yes.

So this is normal. I'm not
like any freak or anything?

A freak? Hardly Tom.

You've seen this before?

Quite often, Tom.

See many men in the...
well, in your position...

see me as a bit of
an authority figure.

Maybe even as a motherly figure.

Huh. I guess I can see that.

Oh, you can?

Yeah, I can.

You're such a bad, bad boy Tommy.

Now come to Momma!

Wow! There must be like 2
million dollars in here!

We can't buy a fire station
with this you guys.

Hell! We can't even buy our
own beer and hot wings!

Well, anybody else got any bright ideas?

I'm working on it. Give me a minute.

Oh, Oh, Oh! I have another idea.

No! I have an idea.

Why don't you guys quit while
you're ahead? Give it up.

Over.

This is a really, really good idea!
I swear!

Mr. Jamison, this is Cash
Gates you're speaking to.

Sir, you've not found
it necessary to show up

for the last 3 appointments
we've made for you.

Our firm is still very interested
in acquiring your property.

Yes, and we're now ready to make an
even larger offer than we did before.

Mr. Jamison! Mr. Jamison.

I told you so.

Yes. You did.

Cadet Riley.

And to what do I owe the
pleasure of this glorious visit?

Well, I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd stop by to say hi.

So... hi.

Hi!

Unfortunately Riley, I've very busy.

I have a lot of work to do. So...

So I could maybe...

spend the day staring at
your youthful good looks.

She is rather good looking isn't she?

Very.

Oh, thanks guys. But...

I'm here to talk
about the fire station.

My home.

Well, it is a shame to see it go.

But, it stands in the way of progress.

There's got to be something
we can do to stop you

from buying the fire house
and shutting us down.

Well, there might be
something you can do.

What's that?

You could offer to buy
the property from the

city with a larger
offer than I've made.

Really?

Riley

Do you have that kind of money?

Well... No... But...

That's why I got this idea.

I was thinking...

maybe you could loan us the money...

and then we could pay you back.

Riley...

Are you serious?

No Mr. Gates.

Are you serious Mr. Gates?

Very serious.

Hungry Becky?

Starving!

Liking that, huh? Yeah.

You like Mr. Gates
touching you like that?

Gonna be a... good girl for us?

Yeah.

I think Mr. Gates has something for us.

Gonna show me how you can do this?

Mitch!

Did you talk to the psychiatrist
for an evaluation yet?

Not yet, Captain.

Well done. I'll guess you'll
be heading to my office.

Right now. Won't you?

Yep. Right away, Captain.

Anything you say.

So.

You're telling me that you also have
a fetish for women with authority?

Not women. Just one woman in particular.

He would've been good to you.

It was just too much to handle.

All I want is a willing hand.

The fire house.

Don't say that. We haven't
lost the fire house yet.

You know what you need?

You need a night out.

Yes you do! You need to get drunk.

No. I really don't.

Oh, yes. Yes you do.
You need to get drunk.

And I know exactly who to call.

No, no, no, no.

Yeah.

Easy.

Easy. You're gonna break it.

Here, let me show you.

I like... mmm...

that one the best. What do you think?

I think you're real serious
about winning this thing.

I'm serious about saving this place.

And keeping the team together.

Oh, I think you're the
kind of girl that

puts her mind to it,
she can do anything.

Oh, yeah? Anything?

Anything.

Hey, you know, I make
a mean pasta sauce?

A what? I make a mean pasta sauce.

If you know, you will have dinner.

A pasta sauce.

Yeah, a mean pasta sauce.

Give me that.

A mean pasta sauce? Yeah,
a mean pasta sauce.

Hope I'm not disturbing you, Captain?

How can I help you, Mr. Gates?

I came to get your signature
on these documents.

I believe, that one there...

is the deed to the property.

I don't understand.

It's quite simple, Captain.

You're going to sign the
deed to the property...

And that in turn will grant title
to you and your battalion.

So the fire house is...

It's all bought and paid for by my firm.

In your name of course.

So if you'd care to make it
official, and sign the deed.

And Becky here will notarize it for you.

What a minute. We're staying?

We're staying.

We get to keep the fire station?

Cash has decided the best way to
keep his downtown investment...

would be to have a battle-tested
fire house in the neighborhood.

Ohhhh!

Well, did ya'll here the news?

Cash bought the property
and gave it to us.

For keeps? For keeps! Ahhhh!

See, I knew my idea would work.

What did you say?

Will you wash the fire truck?

But we just washed it!

Oh... oohh, Captain!
