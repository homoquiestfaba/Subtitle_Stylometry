12 years old the first time</i>

<i>I experienced a deep and
painful loss.</i>

<i>The cause of her death
is still a mystery to me.</i>

<i>And I often wonder if there
was anything I could have done</i>

<i>to prevent it.</i>

<i>I remember finding
her pale, little body floating</i>

<i>in the cold, cruel water.</i>

<i>My mother and stepfather barely
acknowledged what happened,</i>

<i>which made the grieving
process even more confusing.</i>

<i>Being able to persevere
through this tragic loss</i>

<i>helped me to become
the strong leader I am today.</i>

And that is why I am
the perfect candidate

for Northwestern's
liberal arts program.

Goddamn. I'm good.

[inhales sharply]
Suck my dick, Emily Dickinson.

Can you check on the turkey?

[Madison humming]

Okay.

Let's do this.

[indistinct chattering]

Haha. Boom.

check the temperature first.

Yes, Mom. I got it.

Already did that...


Fine.

They're not in the fridge.

they're in the freezer.

Yeah, that would be great.
Actually, that reminds me...

Oh, honey.
Will you also pull out the gin?

It's not in the freezer.

it's in the fridge.

Ugh. This house is so backwards.

[indistinct chattering]

Got ya!
[gasps] Holy shit! Jimmy!

You scared me!

Mm! Oh, oh.

I am wearing the necklace
you gave me.

I gave you that?

This morning!

Oh!

It looks so different
outside the box.

that the turkey was 165 degrees?

Madison! I'm speaking to you!

Mm-hmm. Yep. Mom, I checked it.

It's done.

So, honey,
you're sure it's done?

The thermometer said 165.

Well...

Just because it's dark doesn't
mean it's cooked.

165 degrees. How would you know
that when you're doing that?

Because I can read, Mom.

It's all right. I'll just put it
right back in. Excuse me.

What? Seriously?
Just for a second.

No, Mom. I checked it.
It's done.

You know what, I just want to put it in,
so we can make sure it's crispy and safe.

Why don't I help with that, Mrs. Williams?
No! You do not have to help

with that because it's done.

[Jimmy] Okay. Okay.
No, it's not done.

Why can you not trust that
I can do anything?

This is not about you.
This is about the turkey.

The turkey is done!
The turkey crisps...

Oh my God. Oh! It's so hot!
It's so hot!

[Christmas music playing]

This corn is uh...

tender.

Yeah. This is a good opportunity
to really appreciate the sides

of a dinner and uh...
not focus so much on the turkey.


Kids make mistakes all the time.

I'm not a kid.
I am 18 years old.

And it was an accident, Mom.

And some might say that you
were involved. Hey. Hey! What...

What did everyone do today?

Oh! Dad and I built a snowman.

Oh yeah. It's the, uh, lump of snow
outside with my, uh, clothes on.

Well, that's great!

Madison, did you finish that essay
for your college application?

Yeah.

Yeah, Uncle Andy.
I... I actually did. Um...

Great.

Mom, did you have a chance
to read it yet?

I did.

And?

Honestly, I don't think there's any
college that's gonna accept that essay.

What are you talking about?

Did you really write
about Goldie?


You wrote about your
dead goldfish?

Look, I know you're upset with me,
but Madison, you could do better.

I do not even know why
I bothered to ask your opinion

on the essay in the first place.

I mean, you seize every single
opportunity you can

to criticize me,
so there's that.

Why didn't you write about the
special bond you have with Heather?

Don't write about me.

what's taking so long.

It's not like you have a job.

Maybe something more interesting
would happen if you just

left the house.

Hey, I was looking
through your photo albums,

and mini-Madison was so cute.

Aw. Thanks, Jimmy.

Remember when mini-Madison
wanted to grow up to be a dog?

[Step Dad] Uh-huh.
Aw, you wanted to be a little mini-muffin?

Well, there's nothing wrong with
taking social cues

from man's best friend.

Mmm, she used to put the food
on the floor

and try to eat
without her hands.

[laughter]
Well...

Okay, think we're done
with this subject.

We could probably move on now,
right?

Oh my God, she also pooped on
the front lawn.

[Jimmy] No, she didn't!
[Heather] Dude, yes!

Oh, she did!
So many times!


[music continues]

[phone keyboard clicking]

There you are.

[door shuts]

I come bearing gifts.

Come on.

We were just joking around.


I know. They took it
a little too far.

But, I like being reminded
of mini-Madison.

I'm just so sick of my parents
still treating me like a child.

My mother doesn't appreciate
any of the hard work I'm doing.

Heather is a grade-A bitch.
And... and... and Uncle Andy just...

It's like he's the only person
who...


Seriously?

What?

No, no, no! No, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

I was listening.
I promise I was listening.

[trike clattering]
Hey, hey, hey!

Heather is a grade-A bitch.

I'm sorry. Just talk to me.

I don't know. I just...

[Madison groans] I just wish
they'd leave me alone.

Like, like,
give me my own space.

Maybe even my own room.

Like, sharing a room with
Heather is not exactly

my favorite thing in the world.
You know?

Ugh. I'm 18. Just like let me...

You know what we need?
What?

A vacation.
Ha. Yeah.

Yeah, that's what...

Whoa, I'm not looking at
my phone. Look. I promise.

No, it's not... it's not that.

There's a light on at
the Becker's house.

And?

And they're not home.

[tense music]

I do not see a light.

must have turned it off.

Maybe the house is haunted.
[Madison scoffs] Yeah. Definitely.

Hey! It makes sense. Ghosts mess
with lights all the time.

It's like a common fact.

We should go over there
and check it out.

You want to go
into the haunted house?

It's not actually haunted,
Jimmy.

There is no way you're going
to convince me

to go into a haunted house.

[door creaks]

Mr. and Mrs. Becker?

[key clatters]

It's Madison.

Hello?

[tense music]

How long do you think it's been
since someone was here?

A few months. Probably.

Are you sure you saw
a light turn on?

Must've been bad wiring.


Well, if you're convinced there's
ghosts, we could always...

have a seance.

I am convinced there are ghosts.
And I don't want to meet them.

Jimmy. We have two options.
Okay?

Either, we can stay here,
talk to some ghosts,

or, uh, we can go back and
talk to my angry mom.

Ugh.

Fine. Fuck it.

Let's talk to some ghosts.
Hm.

[phone keyboard clicking]
[phone vibrates]

What kind of person punches an
innocent snowman in the face?

It looked like your ex-boyfriend.</i>

What? No, it didn't.
What do you want?

Uh, listen. Could you cover for
me and Jimmy for a bit?

I mean, Mom and Dad
are pretty hammered,

Uncle Andy is gonna stay over.

You probably have some time.

Okay. Can you just like stuff
some pillows in my bed?

Make it look like I'm sleeping?

I don't know if I want to
traumatize Dad like that again.

You're going to prom this year,
right?

Well, I would be
honored to supply you

with a bottle of booze
as a token of my appreciation.

Two.
[Madison] <i>Absolutely.</i>

Deal.

Perfect.

[sighs]
What is this?

Oh. It's a Hodag.

A Ho-bag?
[Madison] No. Hodag.

He's a mythical creature.
It's a Northwoods thing.

Hm. Well, whatever it is,

it's going to be our official
seance mascot.

Oh, shit!
Jimmy!

Is it bad luck to break
a ho-bag?

[mysterious music]

Oh, great Hodag spirit.

We ask for your forgiveness

and help us ward off the evil
spirits present in this house.

And now,

we will drink
the ceremonial Hodag blood.

Is there paint in this?

No. It's beer
with green food dye.

Ooh. Nice.
Cheers.

Ah. Okay. Put your hands on
the indicator thing.

What do you want to ask them?

Mm. What they want.

Spirits.

What do you want?


[Madison laughs]
It's moving.


You're moving this, aren't you?

No! I swear to God,
I'm not moving this.


I can't believe it's moving.


X.

Sex.

Sex?

Oh, you're saying you want
to have sex?

Jimmy!
Hey, I'm fine with it.

But, just to be clear,
for the record, it was your idea.

Oh, it was my idea? Really?
It was? Shut up.

Hodag as my witness.

[mysterious music]

[objects clattering]

A Hodag ghost?

That's not good.

Protected.

[birds chirping]


Whoa! Oh!
Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey, hey!

We gotta get up. Come on.
[Jimmy grunts]

No, Jimmy. Seriously.

Wake up. Get up. Come on!
[Jimmy grunts]

Whoa!
[thudding]

[tense music]
[sighs]

Oh, my God.

Do you think anyone else
is in here?

Is anyone in here?
Jimmy!

[glass cracking]

last night.


I think they were robbed.

Do you think they got our weed?


The gremlin prostitute's gone.

How did we sleep through
a robbery?

Hodag's revenge.

Okay. Well, we... we have to
call the police.

What? No! No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

We can't call the police.

We'll get in trouble
for breaking and entering!

Uh, no, we won't.

But we did. We're trespassers.
We are lawbreakers.

Yeah, but our broken law is less
bad than the robbers' broken law

so we're good.
Can we just talk about this?

Jimmy! No! Jimmy! Jimmy! No, no, no.
[shouting indistinctly]

[Dispatcher] <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>
[shouting indistinctly]

Jimmy! [screams]
[Dispatcher] <i>Is this an emergency?</i>

[shouting indistinctly]
[Dispatcher] <i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

Jimmy, absolutely not!
[Dispatcher] <i>I... I can hear you. Is someone hurt?</i>

[Madison yelling]
[Dispatcher] <i>I'm sending help over...</i>

S... so why did you guys dress up
for Christmas?

Well, we're concerned citizens...
Well, it's actually not what...

...and we wanted to check out...
...it looks like at all.

...and we had a seance.
It was her idea to come over here.

[Madison] My idea?
Enough.

We're gonna have to separate you
two for the rest of the interview.

your faces before we continue.

Tell me what happened on
the night of December 25th.

[tense music]
Okay.

Wait, so, what time does
night start?

I gotta babysit.

But, I do get to meet a robber
my first day of the job.

Starting off pretty good.
Starting off pretty cool.

I told you.
We didn't rob this place.

Okay.
We... we snuck in.

We fell asleep. We woke up,
and we realized it was robbed.

Like, technically,
we helped you guys out.

Okay. All right. Just forget
the part where I said

it was like my first day on the job.
Okay? I'm not that dumb. All right?


And then the whole thing flew
in my face.

Oh, my God.
So they were the ones

who originally dropped the turkey.
Mm-hm.

So, you see, it's not my fault
Christmas dinner got ruined.

in this situation, if anything,

you're the Christmas hero.

I know!
[laughs]

Thank you!
Man!

Why did you enter
the Becker's house?

I know the Beckers.
My family's cabin is next door.

Really? Next door? Interesting.

We thought they would appreciate
us keeping an eye on things.

We needed to investigate and
confirm if the house was haunted.

Okay. Um...

What happened after you entered
the premises?

We made sure the premises
were secured, and they were.

Didn't see anything too crazy
at the time.

We assessed the haunted lights

which were also securely
shut down.

And look, I know the Beckers
wouldn't mind us hanging out.

So, so, yeah. We played a board
game. Just lit a few candles.

And then we had a seance.

But we didn't do any
of this other stuff.

Did I hear... did I hear you guys,
you said you did a seance?

Yeah. [laughs]
Oh, yeah? [chuckles]

So did you, uh...

talk to any ghosts?

Dude. There was a spiritual
presence in the house last night.

I f... I felt it when I walked in.

But you did not vandalize
anything in the house?

Absolutely not.

Well, so, there was
a Hodag statue. But...

We fixed it.

Well if you didn't rob the house
then who did?

I honestly do not know.

Your boyfriend said that
a Hodag robbed the house.


We're still trying to get in
touch with the Beckers to confirm

your relationship to them.

While I continue
my investigation, I...

Whoa. Uh. Our investigation.

We have agreed to release them
into your custody

so long as you agree
not to leave the county.

Under any circumstances.

I'm sorry, you know,

we have to be in Chicago
tomorrow for work.

Oh, well, I mean that kinda
sounds like a circumstance.

Or, no.

Or we can hold them.

Hold them?

In jail? What? We're supposed
to leave them in jail?

Well...
Yeah, that's kinda how it works.

Babe, what about your brother,
Andy? Maybe he can take them.

I can't stay here.

I'm gonna miss Jennifer's
New Year's party.

Oh, I'm sorry. You're gonna miss
Jennifer's New Year's party?

Where is
my responsible daughter?

[Madison] I am responsible, Mom!
...What are we doing here?

You just never see that.
No. The police are here.

I responsibly reported a robbery.

you should not have stayed.

[Mom] Why are so you mean to me? Also, I stay in a place...
[Mom] Are you kidding me?

[Madison] I don't get to see my friends...
[Mom] Do not try

to out-scream me.
You know what, you go to college

and have a social life.
I would love to go to college

if you would approve my essay.
Every action has a consequence.

Say something.

I'd just like...
Don't.

[upbeat music]

[music continues]

[phone beeps]


You will forfeit both
your cell phones.

You'll sleep in separate
bedrooms.

You'll get up at six AM
every morning

and make your beds and...
what now?


[sirens wailing]
[Andy speaking indistinctly]

[officer speaking indistinctly]

what happened to his house.</i>

<i>I know you're telling
the truth about the Beckers.</i>

<i>But I'm worried you don't realize
that your actions have consequences.</i>

<i>You need to take more responsibility
on and help around the cabin.</i>

<i>So I'm gonna send you a list
of chores to...</i>

Looks like they didn't
get everything.

Not the time.

[indistinct radio chatter]

this job is right for you.

Well, we're gonna stay
at the family house.

Hop in.

[upbeat music]

I'm beginning to think that
maybe you two

didn't rob the Becker's house.

[music continues]


Oh. Thank you.

Okay. I cannot believe that
there are robbers out there

screwing people over and then
letting us take the fall for it.

Yeah. These are the most
inconsiderate robbers ever.

Okay. You know what?

We need to find these assholes
and then clear our names.

Well, what else
are we supposed to do?

It's practically the Wild West
up here.

We should scour the town
for clues.

Stake out the empty houses.

You will do no such thing.

Why not?
Because you are not Sherlock Holmes

and this is real life.

But the police think
that we did it.

You are more likely to end up
getting hurt than you are

to catch any robbers.

I'm sorry. I cannot eat this
box macaroni and cheese.

If we're going to be here
for a while,

I'm going to get us some
real food.

Do not go anywhere while
I'm gone.

Remember, your very presence in
this house is enough

to deter a robber.

[engine rumbling]

[car door shuts]
[tense music]

[Step Dad on recording] <i>I know
your mom is being hard on you, but</i>

<i>that's only because we know how much untapped potential...</i>
[phone beeps]

[Mom on recording] <i>Honey, life
after high school is hard.</i>

<i>Figuring what you want to do
with your life is hard.</i>

<i>But you need a plan. Make a goal chart and...</i>
[phone beeps]

[Heather on recording] <i>Hey, sis.
How's your goal chart?</i>

[phone beeps]
[phone clatters]


[loud thump]

[tense music]

That was nothing, right?

Yeah. Yeah, that was probably
the heater.

So we don't have to
check it out.

We should definitely
check it out.

Shit!

[mechanical whirring]


Okay, I know Andy said
not to do anything,

but I don't think we can just
stay here and do nothing.

Yeah.
[vacuum thumps]

I'm not going to
be able to sleep tonight.

You know what?
We could put a lock on the back door.

Yeah. Let's do that.
[vacuum thumps]

[drill whirs]

Okay. Do you think we should put
some extra lights on timers?

Yeah! Ooh, let's put the tree
on a timer.

[upbeat music]

[air horn blares]
[screams]

Madison, I found these great party pop...
[bubble wrap popping]

[music continues]

Too long.

That...

That works.

Okay.

Close it. Close it. Close it.

Okay!

What?

Do you even know how to use
that thing?

Nope. But if I could figure it
out, I think it could be useful.

Uh-huh.

[bubble wrap popping
in distance]

What the heck is this?


What the...?

Absolutely not.
What?

And definitely none of that.

And, actually,
I don't care about that.

Oh, really?

Well, I was 18 once too,
you know.

But I do not drink and
play with knives.

protect ourselves.

Or at least make some sort of
alarm system.

Well, this is more likely to
harm you than any intruder.


You want to protect yourselves
like responsible adults?

Yes!
Yes!


How long has that been there?

A while.
[Madison chuckles]

[mysterious music]

Madison.

Here you go, Jimmy.

Hold it like Madison.

All right.

You have to chamber a round.

Otherwise you'll look
like a fool with no intent.

Oh, so just like...

[Madison gasps]

For Pete's sake!

No! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Thank you.

These are BB guns.

Take it.

You'll be able to scare people off, but
you won't really be able to hurt anyone.

[gun fires]
[Jimmy] Oh, shit!

Jesus Christ.

Just... just take it from him.


Here are some items you can
actually use.

A pocket knife?

In the right hands
a pocket knife can provide

a person shelter, food,
and security.

Making it an important asset
to mankind.

Aw. It has such a small blade.

That one has a flashlight.

[flashlight buzzing]

Okay. So now, we keep watch.

And hope what we fear
will never come.


[flashlight buzzing]

[somber music]


[tense music]

[door shuts]

[music continues]

All quiet on the east side.
All clear on the lake side.

Have there been serial robberies
like this in the past?

Luckily, no.

Well, why do you think they're
breaking in

and robbing people now?

Hard to say.
It's different for each robber.

I think these robberies are
crimes of opportunity.

Do you guys want to watch <i>Santa
Clause Conquers the Martians</i>?

[Madison] Ooh.
Santa did what?

It's a really good movie. And!

We can play a really fun
drinking game while we watch it.

We should keep a lookout.
[Madison] Why?

I mean, the sun is setting.
We're not going to be able

to see much in the dark
anyway.

Can we just take
a short break? Please?

Wouldn't a movie playing deter
people from breaking in?


What game?

Why don't you teach us a game
that you like to play?

Ooh, you show you yours,
I'll show me mine.

[engine rumbling]

[clears throat]
Kings are worth four points.

Queens three. Jacks two.
Aces are worth eleven.

And then tens are worth ten.

Okay. And nines are nine?

Uh, no. Zero.
What about eights?

Uh, zero.

Seven?

Zero. And, no, you don't play
with any cards under seven.

O... okay.

You'll figure it out.

When do you drink?
Whenever you damn well please.

[upbeat music]

What if the number of points
you score

is the number of seconds the
person to your left has to drink?

Why must everything turn into
a drinking game?

Now, can we just drink and
play a game?

Let's just play something else!

[music continues]

of the card that is in your set

that's the number of seconds
you have to drink.

What are these cards
in the middle here?

Oh, no. It's way easier to
understand the command cards first.

So if someone flips over an ace,

the person across from them has
to pound the table and shout

"Two for all." If they don't,
they have to finish their beer.

I'm not playing this game.

[music continues]



[both laughing]

How long is this movie?

It's 81 glorious minutes.

[music continues]

He said Santa!
Drink!

[indistinct dialogue on TV]

...supposedly frozen
individual moves!

It's rule number nine.
[Madison groans]

Okay. Andy won.
Wake up. Uncle Andy won.

Every time a Martian gets
attacked by a toy, you drink!

[Jimmy] Madison!
[Madison] Straight line.

I forgot to pack my toothbrush.

information. Just keep going.

I can do it myself!
No, Jimmy! Be careful! Just...

Oh, don't forget...

[bubble wrap popping] - [Jimmy] Shit!
[thudding]

Yeah. That.


[guitar playing]

[faucet squeaks]
[water stops]

Hey, kiddo.
I thought you went to bed.

I, uh, haven't heard you play
in a while.

Forgot how much I missed it.

Thanks.

So how's our young Jimmy?

Alive. For now.

What's on your mind?


Probably.

She thinks Jimmy's too immature
for me.

What do you think?

I asked you first.
You did?

Well, do you think that Jimmy's
too immature?

I do not think that Jimmy is
too immature for someone who

does not go to school and
does not have a job.

I knew it. My mom was wrong.

Huh.
[Andy stammers]

Come on! Remind me why
you're with him again?

He's funny.
Yeah, he's amusing sometimes.

But he doesn't realize it.
Okay. But that

is probably because he does not
care what other people think.

Yes, and that was cute
when he was 10.

[both chuckle]

You know, a first love
is complicated.

Especially with someone
you grew up with.

[phone beeps]

Phone's dead.

You'll be fine.

I've lived my whole life without
a cell phone.

And I've somehow survived without it.
Hm.

You know who made that?

Yeah, my dad.

You remember him?

Yeah.

I mean, they're faint memories,
but they exist.

Yeah. Sure.

[guitar playing]

[Andy humming]

Guess that's your cue
to go up to bed.

I'll take the first watch
down here.

And I will take the first shift
watching Jimmy.

Good.

Oh, uh, Uncle Andy?

Thanks again. For everything.

Anytime.

[somber music]

looks like an empty summer home?

always on?


What about that one?

in Chicago.

All right.

[program playing on cell phone]

[music continues]

[tense music]

[wood creaking]

[objects clattering]

[tense music]

[woman] Shit!
Just stay there.

We thought no one was in
the house.

[indistinct shouting
in distance]

[program playing on phone]

[phone beeps]

Get over here!

Sit down, old man!

How many other people
are in the house?

Just me.

So, what now?

[wood creaking]


Okay, how drunk are you?

Mm.
[Madison] Okay.

I'm going to take my hand off your
mouth, but you have to be quiet.

We're being robbed.
What?

Jimmy!

Okay. I need your phone.
I'm gonna call 911.

And your phone is dead.

Yeah. It's my bedtime story.
It helps me sleep.

Okay. Um, I'll just drive
to the police station.

I got our coats. Come on.
Okay. [groans]

[tense music]



this sheepshank one?

Huh?
[woman] The sheepshank.

I know how to tie
a fucking knot!

[board clattering]



[tense music]

Okay! Jimmy, toss me the keys.
[groans]


All right.

Jimmy.
[groans]

These are not Andy's keys.

Fuck! They're not?

In what world do you think
that these are Andy's keys?

I'm sorry.
Can we still use them?

No. we cannot still use...

What?

[engine sputtering]

I don't... I don't understand.

What's wrong?
I don't know.

Oh, shit. It's a stick. Umm.
Do you know how to drive stick?

No. Do you?

No, of course not.

Why else would I ask you if
I knew how to drive...

Holy shit!
[man] Get out of my truck!

It's the fucking Hodags again!
Okay, okay! Okay.

of my truck!

want to get out now!

[Madison speaking indistinctly]

[screams]
[Jimmy] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Fuck! Fuck!

goddamned truck.

Now.

[tense music]

All right. Give me your
cell phone.

They're dead.
You don't have to...

Even better. Give it to me anyway.
You too!

I don't have a cell phone.
That's impossible.

I really don't.

He's telling the truth.

What? I don't understand that.

How can you just not have
a phone?

Fuck. We don't have enough rope
to tie everyone up.

Well, um, why don't we just tie
his shoelaces together?

There's more rope in the garage.

Okay.

Just stay here. Watch them.
Nobody moves.


Nobody moves!

[door opens, shuts]

You know, I actually have to say
I kind of appreciate

how cooperative you guys are
being, 'cause, to be honest,

this is my first time ever
having a hostage. [chuckles]

So, um...

have any of you guys ever
been robbed before or anything?

Well, this is the second time I've been robbed.
[woman] Oh.

But the first time I've ever
been held hostage.

Oh cool, cool. That's cool.

Umm...

Wait a second. I feel like I've
seen you guys before somewhere.

Oh, that's, uh, weird.

Hey, listen, I... I just,
I'm gonna be honest, you know,

since this is your first
hostage thing.

So this rope that's tying my
legs together,

it seems a little loose.

Really?
Yeah, I um...

did a great job with the knot.

Hm. Yeah, the knot's no good.
You should've used a square knot.

Square knot?

[Andy] I can teach you.
[woman] Yeah?

Okay!

Now you take one end
in each hand.

[woman] Okay.
[Andy] And then you take the right end

and throw it over the left.

[woman] Right over left.
[Andy] Yeah.

And then pull it under.

And then take the left end
and cross it over the right

and then pull that under.

Yeah, that's great. Oh.
That's amazing. Good job!

Yeah. And then you pull both ends.
[door opens]


It's really simple but it looks
really fancy! Aw, good!

Hey baby,
I made a triangle knot!

[Madison] Square knot.
A square knot!

Where the fuck is the other kid?

[woman] Oh, he was here just a second ago!
Fuck!


Don't shoot!


Get back over here!

What the fuck was that?
It was just a party popper.

A party popper?
It's a homemade alarm system.

Yeah, we set them up all over
the house.

Oh, that's actually
a really good idea.


So there's more of these? Jesus.

Here, tie him up with that
fancy new knot you just learned.

It's a square knot.

Um, okay,
if you could just have a seat.

Uh, sure. Right here?
Yeah, okay.

[party popper pops]
[man] Shit!

[party popper pops]
[clattering]

[man speaking indistinctly]

[party popper pops]
[man groans]

[bubble wrap popping]
[woman humming] Right over left. Left over right.

[air horn blares]
[man] Goddamn it!

Air horn?! Air horn?!

I'm gonna kill that kid.


I'm kinda proud of myself.

You little shit!
[clattering]

Outside. Now!

[tense music]
[door opens, shuts]

[robbers arguing indistinctly]

Guys, those are the Hodags!

What Hodags?
[Andy] You know Hodags aren't real.

No, I know
that Hodags aren't real.

Those are the Hodag masks that I
saw at the Beckers' last night.

Yeah, Jimmy!

I think we all kind of figured
they were the same robbers.

Yeah. But now you know I didn't
make the Hodag thing up.

Oh, my God.
[Andy] Yeah.

[door opens]
So what's our next move?

We're going to cooperate.

[whispering] What?
[whispering] What?!

we could fix it.

It's such a tiny little
bullet hole.

I'm not gonna patch tires
with duct tape

like a fucking asshole!

There's a tube of super glue in
that bin that might be of use.

Thank you!
Yeah.

What?
Just go outside.

[door opens, shuts]

So we're just gonna sit here
and watch them rob our house?

They have a gun, Madison.
We have a BB gun!

We are going to cooperate so
the situation doesn't escalate.

[tape ripping]

[robbers grunting]

This isn't working. How are we
gonna get to New Orleans?

New Orleans? You're worried
about New Orleans, baby?

I'm worried about how we get out
of the fucking driveway!

Can't we... can't we just
take their truck?

And leave ours for the police
to find it? Come on.

What is this?
What are you doing?

I am going to make this worth
our time.

What are you...

What is...

[tense music]

Not the canoe!

Please?

Huh?

My dad, um, made that for me.
Just...

it's not worth anything.
I swear.

Thank you.

Uh, could you leave <i>Santa
Clause Conquers the Martians</i>?

[Madison] Seriously?
What?

It's a really good movie.

Doesn't sound that great.

Oh, it's actually highly
entertaining.

[door opens]
Yeah. Okay.

[whispers] Yes.
[door shuts]

Super glue doesn't do shit!

You... you could use
the spare tire.

I only have one.

But I also have one.

I believe my car keys are on
the kitchen counter.

Shit. Yeah. That'll work.

Missed one. Give me this.

[door opens, shuts]

[tense music]

[glass breaks]

[music continues]

Did you guys also want
some water?

Sure!
That would be awesome.

Here we go. And...

[water running]

Okay, all right, let's see.

Aw!
[woman] Some for you.

Thank you!

Oh.
Awesome.

Very much appreciated.
[woman] For you!

Okay, yeah! That's good.

Oh. Uh...

That's not gonna work.

Um.
You know what? There... there's straws,

uh, in the drawer
under the microwave.

Oh, my God, she's so nice!
Mm-hm.


[Madison and Jimmy] Oh!
Found 'em!

Aw, that is so sweet!
Thank you!

Very kind of you.
[woman] And...

There and perfect! There we go.

That's good, so...

[Jimmy grunting]

Oh. I guess that's not
really much better.

No. Perhaps if you move those
stools from the other room

in front of us, it might be
a good height for the straws.

That's a great idea! Yeah! Okay.

In here?
Yeah.

[woman muttering]
That was a great idea. I get it.

There you go.
[woman] Okay!


Uh. Can you hold this for me?

And then we'll do this guy.

Here.
Nice!


Thank you!

This guy, and then, oh yeah! That's like, perfect.
[chuckles]

There ya go! Yeah!

I like your necklace.
Mm?

Oh, thank you!

Can I have it?
What? Oh, uh.

Well, Jimmy gave it to me.

Oh, you can just give it to her.

I got it out of a vending machine.
[door opens, shuts]

I'm sorry, you what?
Oh, boy.

What the hell is this?

Well, they were thirsty. So I...

What?

Well, I didn't want to be rude!

Any... any more rude.
You know?

Baby, please.
We are almost out of here.

Just grab some more pillow cases
and meet me in the garage.

[door opens, shuts]

the plan with the stools?

What?
[door shuts]

The stools? Didn't you have her
move them over here so we could

do something with them?

Listen to me,
we are going to cooperate.

Okay, Uncle Andy.
Let me ask you this.

What happens if that guy snaps?

Do you have those pocket knives
I gave you?

Yeah!
All right, now.

Give me one just in case.

Yeah. It's in my back pocket.
All right.

Oh, you know what? I'm kinda sitting on it.
Let me just... hang on.

Jimmy, be careful!

[Andy] Jimmy, come back this way!
[door opens]

[Madison] Oh, oh.
[door shuts]

[Jimmy] Got it?
Okay. Got it!

Yeah, right there. Okay!

[objects clattering]

Ow!

Ow! [coughs] Oh!

[Madison gasps] Are you okay?
Is it bad?

Oh, that's a lot of blood.
Is it broken?

[man] The fuck happened?
I got booby-trapped!

You shouldn't have taken off
your mask!

[woman coughs] What?

Now they know
who the fuck you are!

Do you have any idea
how fucked we are?

[woman groans, stammers] They
weren't... they're not gonna tell!

Oh, really?
We won't. We promise.

They're not gonna tell!
Stop!

I can assure you we
will not.

I'm actually terrible
with faces.

See, we're good!
No!

Now we need to...

We need to talk in private.

[tense music]

[door opens]

[door shuts]

We need to get to the basement.

[music continues]

Come on, keep your head back.

[woman groaning]

Where are we going?
Just get in the truck.

What are you doing?

Just try not to get blood
everywhere.

[music continues]

Come on. Okay. Get in.

wait! The BB gun!

Where the hell is he going?

Jimmy!

you go?

Do not make me look for you!

What are you doing?

I'm getting rid of them.

Where are the others?

I don't know. They must be
hiding somewhere in the house.

Wait!

Um.
We can't get rid of him now.

'Cause they'll never come out
if he's dead.

Fuck. This situation
is so fucked!

I'm sorry. Okay, I'll fix it!

Hey kids, you can come out
because we have your dad.

We have your fucking dad!

How do you check for
a pulse again?

He's just unconscious.

Maybe they're upstairs.

Okay, here's our chance.

We'll get out and
we'll get Andy, okay?

[whispering] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me try.
[rattling]

Shit.
[rattling]

Just stop. Okay. You're going to
make too much noise. Okay?

The bedroom door
is probably open.

[tense music]
[Jimmy] Shit.

Okay. Um...

Fuck. Fuck.

another way out of here?

No, there's not another
way out of here.

Well, then what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

We're gonna wait. Yeah.
That's it.

We're just gonna wait.

We're gonna wait and, um, and the
robbers are gonna leave eventually.

And... and Andy will wake up.

Andy's definitely gonna
wake up. And, uh...

No. I've got an idea.
What?

I'm gonna shoot through
the ceiling as a distraction.

You're gonna run up the stairs
when they open the door...

Jimmy! Jimmy! Just stop! Okay?
Just stop!

stupid ideas that always end up

with you hurting yourself or
someone else getting hurt.

I'm sorry. I'm just trying to
help us out of a deadly

situation where someone...
Okay, look. You know what...

...is trying to shoot us.
...would help? You know what

would help?
Is if you acted like an adult

for five fucking seconds.

I do act like an adult! I have a job.
Shhh!


I go to work. You just sit here
and write letters about

your fucking stupid goldfish!
[laughs]

You have a job? You deliver weed.
They pay you in edibles.

Yeah. They do pay me in edibles.
Edibles that you happily eat.

I don't need edibles
to be happy.

What do you need to be
happy, Madison?

Because all I'm trying to do
is fucking make you happy.

I just want to make you happy.

And apparently
I can't do that anymore

no matter how hard I try. So.

[somber music]

I had no idea I was making you
feel like this.

Yeah.

We're gonna need each other

if we're gonna make it through
the rest of the night.

[music continues]

So what now?


We wait.

And hope that Andy wakes up.

[music continues]


[music continues]

[safe dial clicking]

[music continues]

Can you come here, please?

I think he's still alive.

If you find the others,
just shoot them.

Where are you going?

To get rid of him.

Uh. Okay. We... we have to
get out of here.

We have to get out of here now.

I think I can break this open.

What the hell are you doing?
Jimmy? Ugh!

[pellet ricochets]
Shit!

Can't you...
[footsteps thumping]

I know you're in there.

They found the trap door.

[tense music]

I'm coming in!

[footsteps overhead]

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

We should just wait it out.

They'll never find us down here.

And then we can figure out how to
open the door when they're gone.

This was your plan.

I know.

We have to help Andy, okay.
We can't just wait here anymore.

Madison, Madison!

[tense music]


Hello.

My name's Madison.

Okay.

is Jimmy,

and my uncle's name
is Andy.

He's your uncle? I...
I thought that was your dad.

Oh. You know what? I could see
how that would be confusing.

Yeah.


Patrick.
Is he your boyfriend?

Yeah.

What was your name again?

Christine.

Christine, you don't...
have to do this.

What other choice do I have?

Well, what do you want?

Well, I don't want to go
to jail.

You won't. No, I promise,
we would all testify for you.

We just have to stop Patrick
and help my uncle.

He's... he's really angry.
You don't...

You don't know what it's like
when he's angry.

[snow crunching]
[tense music]

Why are you with him?

He takes care of me, I guess.

Why are you with your boyfriend?

He's fun.


I bet it's really fun to have
somebody else to boss around, huh?


Oh Christine. Christine,
don't cry, okay!

Everything's gonna be fine.

It's gonna be okay.

Okay.
[Madison] We just need to help my uncle.


Okay.

Where are you?

Oh, yeah. Um,
we're under the bedroom door.

What?

How is that possible?

You know, just, just close
the bedroom door.

Okay. It's closed.

Has that been here
the whole time?

Yeah. It's crazy, right?

Okay, Jimmy. You got this?
[Jimmy] Yeah!

[Madison] I need the rifle.
No!

No, no! It's gonna be fine.
Okay? I'm not...

I'm not gonna hurt Patrick.
Okay?

I'm not gonna hurt him.
Just...

Okay. Call 911. All right?

Just tell them you need
an ambulance!

[tense music]
[sobs]

Stop!

Where's Andy?

He's in the canoe.

[music continues]


Drop the axe.

Why?

'Cause it's over.

Really?

Yeah. Christine called the cops.

Yeah. So you might as well
give up now, Patty-boy.

Christine would never do that.

Oh, well she did.

In fact, you're gonna hear
a siren going any minute now.

[car engine starting
in distance]

[car driving off]

The police are still coming.

She... she definitely called them
before she left.

So what's the plan?

We stand here until the police
never come?

See who gets hypothermia first?

I bet you'll be the first

to lose feeling in your
little fingers.

Well, if we get too cold,
we could just shoot you.

we'll just shoot you.

With your BB gun?

How did you...?
But it looks so real!

I could always shoot you
with your gun.

[gun clicking]

Yeah.

[tense music]

Don't come any closer. No!

I will shoot you.
Do not come any closer.

I don't believe
you have it in you.

You see I've known people
like you my whole life.

You never worked a day. You had
everything handed to you.

No.

You're not gonna shoot me.
[Madison shouts]

[gun fires]

Holy shit! I just shot him.

Holy shit! You just shot him.

Oh, my God,
I just killed someone.

You did just kill someone.

Um, Andy?

Andy! Andy! Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

Are you okay?


You're, like, okay?

Okay.

Okay. Are you breathing?
You're breathing. All right.

Quite the wound.

Okay. It's going to be okay.

I don't know what to do.
I need, like, a pressure thing.

I don't know. Okay. [muttering]

Oh, that was a noise!
That's good.

[splashing]
Woah! Jimmy! What the fuck!

What are you doing?

I gotta get rid of the body!

What are you talking about?
What? Why?

You always have to
get rid of the bodies.

Okay. Now, we have to figure out
how to clean up all the blood.

Jimmy, just... just... just stop.
Okay? Just... just stop everything.

[sirens wailing in distance]


I guess she did call the police.

[pen clicking]

Could you just explain to me
one more time...

what the bubble wrap was
supposed to do?

I just... I don't...

That's the part I don't get.
