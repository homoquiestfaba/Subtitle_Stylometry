The first one I killed?

Yes.

I don't actually
remember where I killed 'em

'cause I wasn't planning on
killing any of them.

And what happens is...

I've had sex with a lot of women and I don't
really know where everyone is I killed.

I don't know where I killed the first one.
That was Coffield.

Let's not talk about that.
Okay.

Let's go with the ones
that we have not found yet,

the ones you know that are still 
out there that haven't been discovered.

That's where
we'd like to start with.

And... pick whichever one
you want to start with,

whatever one is
freshest in your mind.

And maybe we could...
Maybe there are areas...

General areas of the county
you might want to start with.

The ones we were talking about.
Just start with the site.

And where's that body,

and then what you remember
about it will be fine.

We'll go to the farthest one out.

I think it's over by...

Fall City exit off of l-90.

Okay.
And...

You go...

I don't have a map in my mind.

You go out to, I think,
Fall City, and...

I think it's Fall City.
And you take a right

and you go down a long road

and there's a...

there's a blacktop road
off to the right,

and you go
about maybe half a mile

and there's a hill,
and you go up the hill,

and I put a body there

off the...

Parked over there.
It was at night.

Was it dark when you did it?

Dark when I did it,
and it was...

I'm quite sure I can find it.

Something like, I think, 197 East,

or something like that...
197, I think.

In his lengthy confession
given to prosecutors,

Ridgway stated that he wanted to kill
as many prostitutes as he could,

and admitted to murdering 48 women
whom he remembered by name.

Nice place.
Yeah.

Sometimes l...

I took the women just home.

It was the easiest way.
I told my son Kevin

that Daddy had to save their souls.

Hi, I'm Kevin.
What's your name?

My name's Honey.
Nice to meet you.

You know I love you, Kevin.

Wow. Kinda messy.

Stop being so serious, Gary.

Gee, you're awfully
complicated, mister.

Hey, relax!
Take a shower.

Look, I don't have time
for any of that.

I'm gonna leave.
I said take a shower!

No!
Stop messing with me.

Take a shower.

You always play.
Take your hands off me!

Hey, no problem, all right.
I'll take a shower.

But remember, it's another Ben Frank
for each additional hour.

And I need to be paid
in advance, all right?

How about you?

You're still dressed.

That's not fair.

Play with yourself.

What's wrong?

Take a pee.

What?

Piss.

Golden shower's another Ben.

Wow, I'm gonna get rich today.

Could I have a glass of water?

I want you to get plenty.

Where do you want to get it?

In the bathtub maybe?

That way you don't have
to clean up afterwards.

I have to take a shit first.

Is that okay?

Yeah, perfect.

All right, leave.

Wanna wipe my ass?

You can if you like.

Now, suck it.

You scared me, Gary.

Why did you do that?

Because I like it.

You turn me on!

Ah, it's so big.

Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Ouch, that hurts!

Where's your son?

His name's Kevin, right?

What do you want?

I'll do anything!
Oh, yeah?

How about a little sucky sucky
or 69?

What's your favorite scene,
Gary boy?

Oh, yeah.

Bad boy, you're so sweet!

Mommy knows you are!

"'Be quiet and do not play, '
answered the frog.

'I'm gonna give you
the good advice.

But what will the dog
give me if I fetch it,

that toy thing up again?"'

He was good boy.

Never talked back.

A little slow in school,
so I made him read a lot.

You know, say stuff,
you know,

all that good stuff like Anderson
and the Brothers Grimm

and so on and so forth.

"Will it love me and
let me be a companion

and playful
and sit at that table..."

Fairy tales, right?

Good old-fashioned
fairy tales.

"And drink from the cup and sleep
in the bedroom bed.

And thou will promise me all these.

Then I will dive down and fetch up
the golden bowl."

Jane Doe, B-47.

Jane Doe, B-48.

Most of the time, I would

go in there, in the house...
all the time I would go in the house.

I'd go to the bathroom
and wash up.

And...

sometimes she'd go
into the bathroom.

I don't know if she did or not.

And sometimes we'd shower,

both of us,

and go on back
into the bedroom,

and...

get completely naked,

and have, usually,

oral sex first.

And then I'd be on top.

And if l...

It was a combination
if I had a bad...

bad day at work or... anger,

I would...

If I couldn't have a climax,

I would get behind her
and sometimes I'd...

If she... If she...

just laid there

and just didn't do anything,

she wants to hurry up,

and the combination of things,

then I'd just explode and that's it.

You know, I'd kill the woman.

I didn't see their faces.

Hey, relax!

I didn't look at them
much after I killed them.

We'll get along further.

I keep having
those nghtmares of myself,

getting cut up and stuff.

Always the same dreams,

as if it's trying
to tell me something.

Maybe if I had enough money, l...

I would've looked up some fancy shrink
down in LA or so

to tell me what
that's all about.

And then there's Boris,
my buddy,

creepin' up in my dreams
like some phantom or something.

Always lookin' for me.

He's been dead a long time.

It must have been some time in November,
'79, if I'm not mistaken.

Yeah, yeah, that was it.

November 27, '79.

Yeah, that's when he died,

on Thanksgiving, 1979.

I remember that day
as if it was yesterday.

July 15, 1982.

Lisa Lee discovers
the body of Hedy Lauren

at the Green River
between Kent and Tukwila

near Seattle
in the state of Washington.

Within a month,
seven bodies of young women

are discovered
along the Green River.

The King County police launches

the Green River Task Force
to solve the killings,

which seem to be the work
of a serial killer.

Is there anything else?

Okay, if you can have
that package together,

I'll send my deputy
on to pick it up.

All right? Thanks.

Just got a call
from the forensics lab.

The last one that
they found out there,

they just confirmed that
her larynx was crushed.

There's bruising on the larynx.
There's external bruising around the neck.

I need to have you run out
and pick up that package.

All right, not a problem.

Hey, I've been hearin'
some talk around town

that Mona down at the bar might know
a bunch of these girls.

I was thinking of bringing her in.
Yeah, get her in here.

All right.
All right?

Sounds good.
Good.

So, what have you been up to,
Gary, man?

Meet any girls lately?

Come on, you don't have
to hide things from us, Gary, man.

Yeah, we're, like, good buddies,
you know,

and good buddies don't hide secrets
from each other, right, Kerry?

Yeah. Let me tell you a secret.
You wanna hear a secret, Gary, man?

You gonna really...
You gonna tell him, Kerry?

Of course.
He ought to know, man.

Come on, what they say about him,
all those dirty things.

You know, Gary, man, the dirty things
they say about you?

They say you're
the Green River Gary.

You know.
And... And you know why?

I've seen you down at the river.

What are you doin'
over there, huh?

He's just minding his business, Kerry.

You know. Leave him alone.

Well, you down there
trying to catch fish?

I don't see you catching fish.

I watched you.
I was fishing.

Well, you tell him, Jimmy.

No. No.

You oughta tell him.
You... You brought it up.

They say you're the Green River killer.

All the people?
Yeah.

What people?

People we've been talking to.

They say you're
the Green River killer, Gary.

You think it's funny?

Yeah.

Very funny.

My wife Irene
is always working during the day,

seven days a week while I did night shift
at Harold and Johnsons,

the packing place
I worked for from '75 to '89.

We didn't see much of each other,

except for a few hours
here and there, and...

When I didn't watch over Kevin,

it was her turn.

Kevin, honey, you home?

She did a pretty good job, yeah.
Kevin, baby, where are you?

She did.
She's not a bad woman.

Kevin, are you in here?

Oh, a little goofy sometimes,
you know.

Saying wrong things at the wrong time.
You all right?

Where's Daddy?

When did he leave?
About an hour ago.

Okay. Are you hungry?

Did Daddy make you
anything to eat?

What did he make you?

Popcorn.

Popcorn?
That's not a real dinner.

Do you want
french fries with ketchup?

Okay.

Not now, Gary.

It's late. I'm tired.

You know,
if you made more money,

I wouldn't have
to work so much.

You know, and then I could
be home and ready for you.

Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

Come here.

I've been married three times.

Come on, I apologize.
Okay, baby?

But everybody else is
getting divorced, you know.

I guess...

there may have been
a lot less girls dying

if I had a nice woman
to come home to.

Don't be upset.

I never thought about that.

I think that... that
would have been something.

Well, all right then.
Fuck you.

Prostitutes were the easiest.

I went from having sex with them,

to just plain killing them.

That's my girl.

Another vodka.

Cheers.
Cheers.

So how do you like it, honey?

Got some extra cash, honey?

Oh, yeah.

B&D is okay with me.
S&M is out.

Okay.

So, show me.

You gotta show me the money first.

So, how about some money?

Okay.

Nice.

Okay, watch.
Okay.

I want you to watch.

All right.

Lay down and watch.

Take your clothes off.

You're so strong.

Oh, I like that.

You're a bad, a bad boy, Gary.

Would you like
to give me a little spanking?

I want you to suck something.
Sure.

Now suck it.

Suck it good.

Hey! Take it easy!

What's wrong with you?
Chill out.

You're wrong for this.
You know what?

What? What? What?
I'm not too crazy about all this.

Why don't I just give you back some
of your money and we'll call it a day, okay?

No. Come here.

You don't take "no"
for an answer, do you?

Fuck, I'm done with this!
Done with what?

I'm leaving.

Where you going, huh?

You're fucking crazy!

You're fucking crazy, asshole!

Stop it. Stop terrorizing me, asshole.

Okay.

Now, open the door and let me out.

Move! Now!

Take it easy.

Open the door and let me out.
Move!

Okay, I was just trying
to have some fun.

Go. It's okay.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go, go.

What do you want from me?
You want some fun, huh?

You want to fuck with me, huh?
You want to fuck with me?

Gary, this is...

this is actually quite a turn-on.

You... You turn me on like crazy.

Really?

Uh-huh.
That's good.

You know, I could give it
to you real good.

All day long if you like.

You fuckin' bitch!
You fuckin' bitch!

How do you like that, huh?

But I'm not... I'm not sick.

I'm not a sick man. L...

I killed because I could.

I mean, I just wanted to kill.

But I couldn't stop for a while.

You said what? It's 48?

I say it's more like 80.

Or maybe a hundred,
or even more.

I don't remember.

Yeah. No, no, no.

I can't tell you
most of their names. I...

I didn't know their names.

I was...

When I was finished...
when I was done with them,

I'd put them on the truck,
cigarette and all.

Sittin' right there next to me
as if they were still alive.

And then I dropped them
up at the river.

Yeah, then I dropped them
at the river.

I... I killed them.

I didn't torture them.

They went fast.

I'm showing you a photograph
of a truck you used to own.

Yes.
With license PR5996.

Did you used to own that truck?
Yes, I did.

And is this the truck
you're talking about?

Yes, it is.
And did you kill...

When you talk about killing
the women in a truck,

is this the truck that most of them
occurred in?

This is the truck that most of them...
Until the truck got totaled.

I think I killed

I don't know how many
in the other truck.

One of the first ten or so.

First ten you did?
I'm just guessing ten.

Relatively early on in the series?

Yes, because the first seven
I did in November.

There's no... It's just
in my mind where it was.

I try to keep that all in my mind,

'cause...

I wanted to...

I wanted them to be found.

You wanted them to be found?
Yeah.

And...

one time I made a map and kind
of located on the map where I put 'em.

All of the victims, I think.

Where's that map now?

I threw that away.
I went back and tore it up.

It would have been
with my stuff if I had it.

Are you sure it's gone
and you don't have it?

No, I don't have it at all.

We found another one of your girls
down at the river, dead.

Jesus.

Her name's Gena Bellweather.

She was murdered
some 48 hours ago.

It makes it ten
in less than a year.

Now, we gotta find this killer.

I don't know what to tell ya.

There's so many different hicks that
come in there to pick up girls, you know.

Did anybody in particular stand out?
Maybe look strange?

Anything? Nothing?

Yeah, you know,
there is one guy.

What's his name?
I don't know.

He's different. He's kind of...
He's just different.

He's not one of the typical hicks
that grew up around here.

What's he look like?

He's kinda tall,
good-lookin', dreamy eyes.

You know,
he's kind of charming.

Hey, I'm lookin' for Gary Ridgway.

He's over there.

What's that all about?

Gary Ridgway.

Detective Dawson, S.P.D.
Lieutenant Cole.

Got a few pictures I want to show you.
See if you recognize any of these women.

No.

Familiar?

Recognize her?

No, I...

Well, they hang out at the bar
you frequent.

You know the bar
you're at all the time?

And you don't know
any of those girls?

You want to show him
the pictures again?

How about her?

Her name's Gena Bellweather.

Mean anything to you, Gary?

You recognize that name?
Gena Bellweather?

You know Mona, Gary?

Who?
Mona... she owns the bar.

Oh. Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

She says you've been going out
with a couple of her girls.

I hear you spend a lot of time
down by the river.

Catch much fish
down there, Gary?

What do you do down
at the river, Gary?

Water's a little too muddy
for fishing, Gary.

Yeah, you don't look like too much
of a nature boy to me.

Maybe if you're not pullin'
somethin' out of the river,

you're puttin' something in.

I think we better talk
to your supervisor, Gary.

Find out how you've been
spendin' your time.

You may want to get
an attorney.

Soon.

We'll be back.

Can we talk to you guys?
How long you known Gary?

Just four weeks.
I'm all ears, son.

You ever seen any...

weird things in the back... tarps?

What's my name?
God, Gary...

Don't play games with me!

It was just a joke.
I was just kidding.

I was just kidding.
We were just kidding!

Nobody believes
you're the Green River killer.

It was just a joke!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Gary, I'm sorry!
What's my name?

It's Gary.
Shut up!

Say it slowly.
What's my name?

Gary. Gary Ridgway.

That's right.
We were just kidding.

You said there was a hiatus
where you didn't kill anybody.

It was between...
I don't think I killed anybody between...

I think it was August through... Christmas,
I think.

Because I was going
with Ellen.

What year would that have been?
'84, I think.

I had an okay childhood,

I guess.

I didn't do anything bad,

except for...

what was it...

maybe suffocating a cat
once in a while.

Or...

What was it?

Paying a little girl
a couple of bucks to, you know,

to play with her.

And...

At...

It was...

At thirteen, yeah, l...

I think I stabbed a little boy,

but...

I forgot why.

I have a lot of fun with my boy.

I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.

He's been on the road
driving trucks

for that shipping company
down in Portland.

Yeah.

But he calls me
every now and then.

He never finished high school.

What the heck.
Neither did I, right?

Jobs aren't...

aren't comin' easy your way
anymore these days,

even when you've graduated
from college.

Ah, no.

Nothin' is what it used to be.

Nothin' at all.

I mean, look...
look, I mean.

Look, look, look at the...

at the Seahawks, right?

Or what's the other team?

The Raiders.
Just look at the Raiders.

They used to be
a great team back in...

the '80s.

Doris Koons.

Kim Willard.

Regina Metz.

Ellie Stanton.

It sort of bothers me.
There's something about this guy.

On the other hand, he really doesn't fit
the profile of a serial killer.

Married, 14 years.
A kid.

I don't know.

It just doesn't add up.

Yeah?
Gary Ridgway?

Detective Dawson, S.P.D.
Gary, how you doin'?

We got a couple of questions.
You mind if we ask 'em to ya?

Gary, are you married?
Yeah.

That's funny, 'cause somebody mentioned
they might have seen you come in here

with a prostitute named Annie?

You know, one of
the girls from the bar?

Look, we don't want
to bug you too much.

But we'd like to come in and look around.
Do you mind?

Yes, I do mind.

There's this buddy of mine, Boris.

Maybe... something.

You know, like a friend.

But then again, I, I...

I don't really have
many friends, you know?

But Boris was the one who...

He's the one who got me...
who got me into all this.

He used to pick up hookers
at the Bellan's bar on...

on the east side of town.

He had a nice place up north
where he took them.

And he let me watch them
from the outside.

So, I'm...

I'm standing there in the dark,

and watching him
having sex with those girls,

and then killing them.

Yeah.

Boris is what you might want to call

a hero of mine, or a mentor,

or something like that.

But Boris, he...
you know, he only killed

like maybe two or three girls...
that was it.

Just two or three.

There was this brunette.

There was one that was missing.
I think he showed me.

Long hair.

What color hair?
Do you remember?

I think it's brown.

Not puffed up,
just kind of...

I think that was her, yes.
I think.

This girl was not that tall?

Not much taller than me,
but skinnier and...

Do you recall
how she was dressed?

No, I can't.
Okay. Where you picked her up?

It had to be the victim or...

And she was the one that...
I dated her before.

I dated her before.

So you dated the...

I didn't date her before,
but I dated other people...

Not the same cycle.

That was before I used my place
for everybody.

One last time.

One last time.

You guys have to stop
following me.

Like I wasn't the guy
you were lookin' for.

One last time.

It's a nice place.
Yeah.

Have a seat.

You got some music
or somethin'?

You don't live here
by yourself, do you?

Your wife?

Don't you think we should
do this someplace else?

I mean,
if I were your wife...

I'd just feel
a little more comfortable...

Do you want to do it in the kitchen?
We could do the dishes.

All right, I could
suck your dick if you like.

Do you hear something?

Someone's here.

Gary, is everything okay?

Hi, I'm Louise, from Portland.

Remember Gary's cousin,
Louise?

I was just about to go
back to the bus stop.

So, Gary,
can you take me back?

Yeah.

It was nice meeting
you again... Irene?

I don't know
about this place, Gary.

There's a nice little motel
right around the corner.

You don't want to make yourself
a little more comfy?

Actually, I don't know whether
I should go out with you.

But you're kinda cute.

Crazy like hell, but cute.

Okay, what do you
wanna talk about?

What do you wanna do?

Stop it!

Who is it?

Who's there?

Mrs. Ridgway, Seattle P.D.

Can I help you?

Yeah, are you
the wife of Gary Ridgway?

Yes.

We have a search warrant
to search the premises.

Why? What for?

Got anything in there?
Is this the master bedroom?

I'll check the bathroom.

How long you been married,
Mrs. Ridgway?

14 years.

Does this belong to you?
Yes.

You got anything?
No.

Huh?

They came back again today

asking all sorts of questions.

Are you sure
everything is okay?

Why are they Zeroing in on you?

And what about
this cousin of yours?

What was that all about?

Oh, no, honey.
You gotta leave.

Go on. Go on. Go. Out!

What's wrong with you guys?

That's also where...
where Boris comes in.

You... You see, in my dreams,

he's in that hospital.

That morgue or whatever
the place where they...

You know, where they cut you up.

He's right there... watching.

Like some... some sicko

getting excited when he sees me
being all messed up and stuff.

And I can't let that happen.
No way.

The time had come to
stop fooling around with those girls.

Too many stupid-ass guys

kept teasing me,
calling me Green River Gary.

My wife...

Well, she started
to get suspicious too.

So I went back to the river
for one last time

and called it quits.

That's...

That's when it all came together.

Finally, all of it with...

my buddy Boris and me.

I had to kill him...

because he saw it.

He'd witnessed me killing
that little girl.

I forgot her name.

Let's see, l...

What is it? I think...

Oh, it was... Marie or...

Marianne something.

Anyways, I couldn't...

I couldn't have that.
I'm sorry it slowed down.

I just, you know...
I couldn't have that.

Sharing my secrets...
That wasn't for me.

So I decided he had to go.

The guy who invented it as far
as I was concerned...

The guy who taught me,
who got me into all this...

he had to go.

It's as simple as that.
So I...

I killed him. Yeah.

It must have hurt.

He's the only one
I hurt real bad.

After all, it was a man, right?

So I gave it to him.

I tortured him.

It must have been a pretty
slow death. Poor guy.

Well, what the heck.

Gary Ridgway?

You're goin' down.
You're under arrest.

I discussed it with my client

and I'm sorry to tell you that
we're pleading not guilty to all charges.

The man is innocent.

Sure, he's had some problems
with the prostitutes.

He doesn't object
to that accusation.

But he didn't kill any.

He may be a john,
but he's not a killer.

You may have found his semen

on or inside their bodies.

Gary hates condoms.

He admits to that.

But he wasn't the last one.

How are you going to prove
that he was the last one?

Who saw them? How are you gonna
prove that he killed them?

You've got nothing on Mr. Ridgway.

You're just wasting
your time and your money.

You should let him go.

He's not the man you're looking for.

He's innocent and he's
gonna plead that way.

Not guilty to all charges.

I've discussed it with my client,

and he is willing to cooperate
if you can assure him

that the death penalty will be
pulled and not considered.

The process will be is that

we'll try to collect as much
information about these.

And that not today,
but within the next day or so,

we'll be all getting into vans
and going out to locations

so that you can
show us in person

where some of these bodies are
or where you put them.

Uh, and so if when there is a need for these
field trips, as we're going to call them,

we'll let your attorneys know
and take the appropriate break

and we'll get into vans
and go out.

And you can actually
show us these things.

We'd like to start by
just having you, I think,

in your own words,
describe to us,

as the proffer
has indicated,

there are 10 to 14 bodies out
there that we have not found.

So I think a good starting point
would be

allowing you to tell us,
sort of in your own words,

about the first one that you can recall,
where it's at.

The women I killed...
I don't give a damn.

They were...
They were nothing.

Nothing at all.

I would lie if I said
I regret any part of that.

I don't.

Now, that I think of it,

the secrets of my dreams
began to unravel.

You know what I'm afraid of?

I'm afraid to die.

I'm scared shitless.

That's why I was so relieved, man.

Man, was I relieved.

We entered this plea bargain
because now...

you can't kill me, right?

See?

I'm determined
to stay alive forever.

Maybe one day because of some
new laws or something,

I'll get out of prison.

Be a free man again
and live forever.

Because... and this is
my greatest fear...

that one day,
should I ever die,

you guys cut me up to look
for the evil inside of me...

in my brains, in my guts,
everywhere.

And l... I can't let that happen.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. But I don't think you
really understand.

Nah, you don't.

Well, maybe someday.

Someday you will understand.

Hello. Mom, it's me, your son, Kevin.

I have a girl in my room.

But I...

I think I killed her.
