Peter was a courageous boy.

But that dawn he could feel fear
stick to his skin like dew on leaves.

The fog was thick enough,
to make him lose his way home.

Then he began to hear strange noises
coming from the depths of the forest.

He noticed a presence...

Small shadows that seemed to giggle
as they followed in his footsteps.

Who were they, grandpa?

Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,
party creatures, spiteful and impudent.

They are the vengeful and evil goblins.
Little people of the night.

What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?

Thats the point: Goblins don't need to justify
their cruel acts, they're evil creatures.

But, let me go on, please!

Okay, i won't interrupt you anymore.

To make a long story short:
Peter started to run

and run

and run...

<i>TROLL 2

Poor Peter remained on the ground
unconscious for a long time.

Finally when he opened his eyes,
he saw there in front of him,
just a few inches away from him...

A goblin???

She was a lovely girl with huge eyes,
the color of the sea.

She looked at him kindly.
Her expression full of love.

Peter immediately fell in love with her.

She caressed him, and offered him
something to eat and drink.

Strange concoction she offered him,
was delicious.

Peter ate and drank without
ever taking his eyes off her.

He was bewitched by that gaze.
And it was that look that deceived him.

I bet it was a goblin in disguise.

These evil creatures can transform
themselves into flesh and blood people,

whenever and however thay want.

You're making a mistake grandpa:
You said they can.

You should've said they could.
Or what kind of fairy tale is it?

They can. THEY CAN!

Goblins still exist.

Your grandpa Seth is telling you.

And how did Peter end up?
He began to feel ill, very ill.

He was sweating chlorophyl green.

GREEN?
That's right. The color of the goblins,
the color of sap.

Then she appeared to him,
and she really was horrible and mocking.

Changed into what?
Half man, half plant. The goblin's favourite food.

Food? Don't tell me they ate him, grandpa!
That's exactly what happened.

With the voracity that has no equal on earth.

What are you doing still up, Josh?

Grandpa Seth was telling me a sto...

Still telling the same story, Josh?

I know mummy, i told you it never happen again,
but you see it's not a dream for me.

I see him in front of me, and he's so real.

And he tells me stories just like before.

Grandpa Seth has been gone for more than
six months now. You were at the funeral
and i know it was very difficult for you.

It was also very difficult for your father,
for Holly, and for me, his daughter.

He was an amazing man.
Grandpa Seth has remained in all our hearts,
but you must banish him from your mind.

Remember what the doctor said?
Of course: Grandpa Seth is an invention
of my subconscious.

That's right.

But he's so real that...
That's enough! Try to go to sleep!

We're going on a vacation tomorrow.
A month in the country will do us all good.

Good night, dear!

Good night, dear!

Mum!
Yes?

Do goblins exist?

No, dear. They don't exist.
Now try to go to sleep!

Yeah John, that's Nilbog, right.
Spell it? Yeah: N I L B O G

Yeah. We'll be gone around a month.
That's right. Can you take care
of the business while we're gone?

Yeah, that's great.
Okay, see you John. Bye.

Are the kids sleeping?
No, they're more awake than we are.

They're probably excited about the trip.

Do you know how many people live in Nilbog?
No. How many?

26, including the Presents. Isn't that wonderful?

Come on to bed.
It's just like, we'll be living
like our ancestors did.

Yeah, we'll be peasants and farmers.
Just like people did a century ago.

Hey, what's the matter?
I'm worried about Joshua.
He's still seeing grandpa Seth.

When i was a kid i had an imaginery playmate too.
But it wasn't your dead grandfather.

It'll end. This trip will make
him forget about your father.

Michael!
Yeah?

Who are the goblins?
The goblins!?

What a jerk!

He pointed the light right at me.

Goblins don't exist.

Elliot, what kind of idiotic joke is this?

You scared the shit out of me.

I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.
I have to release my lowest instincts with a woman.

Release your instincts in the bathroom.
Are you nuts? You're trying to turn me into a homo?

Wouldn't be too hard.
If my father discovers you're here,
he'll cut off your little nuts and eat them.

He can't stand you.
And you?

I like you.

But my family doesn't like you.
They say you're good for nothing
and you spend way too much time with your friends.

Oh, but i swear i never see them.

Elliot, how long it's gonna take?
We're sick of waiting for ya.

Don't you want to come to Nino's with us, Holly?
Don't you want some pizza?

Man, these are cute. Hey!

Do you see!?
What's wrong with having friends?

Nothing, if you want to remain a virgin for a life.
You take them to bed with you too,
and i don't believe in group sex.

Is that true that your family's
going on a vacation tomorrow?
Yes.

I'll come with you!?
Okay, i tell my father that
you're coming with us tomorrow.

Where are we going?
Nilbog, a wonderful half-empty town.

It's an exchange.
A family from the country is coming to live here,
and we're going to live in their house.

Oh Elliot, it will be wonderful.

You and me in the woods. This time
we'll be able to be together for sure.

And my boys!?
If you bring them with you,
i never wanna see you again.

Ok. I'm going now, and i tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning!?

At eight, on the dot.
Okay.

Elliot!
Yeah?

Alone?
Of course. I'll see you tomorrow morning.

Finally.

Please, don't do this, Holly.
We could've waited another fifteen minutes.
I'm sure he would've come.

We left at 9:30 an hour and half after our schedule,
and we've never saw a sign of your bow.

Elliot's not my bow. He's my boyfriend, and he
told me last night that he loves me, and that
he wants to come on this trip with me and my family.

Evidentally he prefered his friends to you.
That's not true!

Yes it is. You should listen to reason!
Elliot is a good for nothing.

Now stop it both of you!
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.

Never liked that kid, i never did.
I'm the one who has to like him, dad. Me alone.

Stop it please! Joshua, start singing!
C'mon sing that song i like so much!

I don't feel like singing, mom.
Just sing!

<i>Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.</i>

Where the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.

It's gotta be there somewhere.
Just look closer.

Here it is, but it's just a suspect.

Are you sure it's full of beautiful girls, Elliot?
Lots of them, free and unattached.

Yeah!

I don't feel good.

Stop the car, dad! I'm sick.

Stuffed yourself like a pig, Joshua.

I would love to see you get sick.
You ate too much.

Dad, stop the car.
Joshua's ready to be eaten.

No, don't eat me!
Joshua!

Was i dreaming?

Who wants to eat you, little brother?
Nobody.

Only a few miles away, Josh.

Speaking of eating: Do you want some, Joshua?
No, thanks.

<i>STOP THEM!</i>

Stop the car, daddy! Stop!
What's wrong, Josh?

Do you have to throw up?
Yes, i have to throw up.

What are you doing here, grandpa?
What are all of you doing here?
You have to make them go back.

Why?
You're getting yourselves into big trouble.

This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.

Can't you tell me more, grandpa?

What are you doing, Joshua?

So how about it?
Are you going to give me a ride or not?

Get in the car, Joshua! C'mon, hurry!

C'mon, get in!

Holly!

Holly, wait!

Well, that was them. Right?
Yeah, right. She just...

Why didn't Holly stop 'em?

I don't think it was such a good idea
to come up here, guys.
Just shut up. I'm the one in charge.

There's noone here.

It's normal. This is a farming community.
Remember: At this time of night,
everybody go to sleep.

Where's the farm?
It's over there.

Now remember: We're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.

Dad!
What Josh?

I don't like this place. Can we go home?
What?

Don't listen to him.
Lead the way, farmer Waits.

Okay.

Fresh air, country air.

Hello!

You're late.
I'm sorry, we had a small mishap.

Here are the keys.
Uhm, here are ours.

Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.
Enjoy our city too.

You'll enjoy our city. It might be a little noisy,
but our house has all the major conveniences.

Yeah, it's got a microwave, a video,
and all the other appliances.
Yeah.

A refrigerator, a bar.

<i>EAT BEFORE WE EAT YOU</i>

Joshua, you're coming?

Not bad.

I'm hungry.

They probably left something behind,
I'd be willing to bet.

Come, take a look everyone!

Tipical country hospitality. Let's dig in!

I'm so hungry.
Here, have some of this!

Here, try this! It looks good.

Grandpa!
Don't let them eat, Joshua!
For the love of God, don't let them eat!

Aren't you hungry, Joshua?

Stop them, Joshua! You're the only one
that can do it. If they eat, they'll
come to the same end as Peter in the story.

But how can i stop them?

Okay. You have 30 seconds to
come up with some way to stop them.

I must do it.

I must do it. I must do it.

No daddy, please!

Don't hit him, Michael!
Please don't hit him.

Why not? It's what he deserves.
A big spanking for a little shit.

Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.

Argh, this smells.

Do you see this writing?

Do you know what it means?

Hospitality.

And you can't piss on hospitality.
I WON'T ALLOW IT!

What are you going to do to me, daddy?
Tightening my belt by one loop,
so i don't feel hunger pains.

And your sister and mother will have to do likewise.

Okay Joshua! You wanna get rough with me!?

You wanna show me that you don't like
the choice of this house for a vacation
by going on a hunger strike!?

Well, i accept the challange, but just remember:
When i was your age i really did suffer from hunger.
We'll see who gets through this.

But just remember: I've got more practice than you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

I'm sick of this. Where are the single,
unattached, twenty girls, Elliot?
Dont be a pain in the neck Arnold! We just got here.

I'm going outside for a breath of fresh air.

Hey, Arnold! If you find any twins, don't be greedy.

Hey!

Hey!

Ma'am! Please stop!

Who are you?
Who are you? Are you one of the monsters?

Well, i've been called a lot of things,
but not a monster.

You're human?
Very human. You wanna see?

What's the matter? Are you sick?
They made me eat that stuff. I'm dying.

They who? Who are you talking about?

There they are!

Uhm, but what are they?
Monsters.

What do you want from me?

Wait here! I'll take care of them.

Let me give you some advice, you dwarves.

Get out of here, or you're going
to be in a lot of trouble.

And remember...

Hey, did you guys hear that yell?

It's probably just Arnold,
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.

No, that wasn't a scream of a woman.
That was Arnold.

Well, it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.

Out of here! Wake!

Lets hide in this house!

What kind of a place is this?

This is my house.

Allow me to introduce myself.

I'm Creedence Leonore Gielgud
of ancient druid origins.

My ancestors came from Stonehenge.

Am i mistaken or is there something
wrong with the two of you?

We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital!

There is no hospital in Nilbog.
We are used to curing ourselves.

Here we are. This broth is miraculous.

It contains sap from the forest.

It is a concentration of all
of the vegetal properties of the Earth.

Drink of it, children, my poor children.

What's wrong? What's wrong with her?
Quit worrying about her. Drink your broth.

I can't... I can't move. Why?

Talk too much for me.

Oh my god. What's happening to her?
And why can't i move?
There must be a logical reason for all of this.

Shut up!

She's changing.

Purifying herself.
Now she's one with the vegetable world.

Now she is food for my children.

Make yourselves comfortable!

They're eating her.
And then they're going to eat me.

OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!

I don't like this place. Not one bit.

Dear Elliot Cooper,
tomorrow morning will be your final judgement.

Either me, or your boys.
Take it or leave it!

The beautiful Holly Waits...

...or your lovely little boys.

Make a choice, Elliot.

Joshua! Joshua!

Mum! Dad! Mum!

What is it? What's the matter? What's wrong?
I saw him.

Who did you see?
Grandpa Seth.

See!? It wasn't me this time.

It was a reflection in the mirror. It was him.
Grandpa Seth was calling out to Joshua.

I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.

So where's that damn mirror?
It's right... right there.

Look! There's noone other than us in there.
But he was there before.

It's gotta be your imagination or hallucination.

Are you still smoking dope, Holly?
I swore i won't, dad.

Look! I wanna get up early in the morning.
We're still farmers now. Right?

I'm not sleeping in this room.

C'mon Holly, didn't you hear what your father said?
I'm not sleeping here.

I'll sleep here.

You would really do that for me?
Sure. Why not? I'm not afraid.

Night son.
Night Josh. Thank you.
Goodnight Josh. Now go to sleep.

Grandpa! Grandpa Seth are you here?

What happened?
You were in the wrong room.
Holly was sleeping there.

I still have to learn the layout of this house.

Well, i'm glad to see you, grandpa.
Did you see? I managed to keep them from eating.

Now you have to convince them to leave here.
This is an evil place.
It is the kingdom of the goblins.

Why don't you tell my mummy and daddy these things?
They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.

That's why she married that good for nothing.

Powers of evil are very strong here.
I must leave. But i'll be back, Joshua. I'll be back.

Grandpa, only you can do something. Only you.

Damn. There's no milk. There's no coffee.
And there's nothing.

Guys, did anyone remember to bring supplies?
We left in too much of a hurry, Drew.

Go in to town to do the shopping now.
Yeah, but i don't have any money.

Just take from all our group fund.
Okay.

Is breakfast ready, dear?

Geez, there's nothing in the whole house.
No eggs, no bacon. There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.

It must be a week old.

Good morning mum. Good morning dad.

What's for breakfast?

Nothing.
What? I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
I've been fasting for two days.

No problem. Josh and I will run in town
to general store. Right, Josh?
Okay.

We won't be gone long.

Hello, son.
Hi.

Are you in training?
No, just going shopping.

Hop in then. You save your breath that way.
Okay. Thanks.

I'm sheriff Gene Freak.
Well, nice to meet you, sheriff.

Are you just passing through Nilbog?
Well, i'm on vacation with some friends.
We parked our camper on the road.

Are you hungry?
Well, a little bit. Yeah.

Good.

I'm sure you'll all enjoy Nilbog.
We're hospitable people.
Especially to strangers.

Now here's the general store.

And sheriff, where do the girls
from around here go at night?
Haha, the girls...

Can i help you?

Coffee!?
There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the devil's drink.

Eggs?
Eeeeeew.

Bacon?
Are you crazy, boy? We're vegetarians
here in Nilbog. Didn't you know that?

Here's some Nilbog milk.

Special milk, high in vitamin content.
Here, it's free.

Free?
Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.

Try some, boy! And have some of
your friends drink some also.
Thank you.

Do you feel allright?
Yeah.

Hey, you.
Yeah?

Your friend has a message for you.

Who? Arnold?
Yeah, that's him.

He said to meet him in the house
that looks like an old church.

Okay.

You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.

Good morning my little flower.

Don't be too worried about the closed mouth.

You didn't have anything to say anyway. Right?

With this you'll become strong and beautiful.

Now i'm going to welcome our new neighbours.

I have just prepared this pudding with wild nettles

and a few organic additives to make it
delicious and purify the intestines.

See you later, my little flower.

<i>Closed. Will re-open in 20 minutes.
After the sermon.</i>

We have to wait and be patient.

<i>Vegetable cookbook</i>

Grendpa! Grendpa Seth! Are you there?

NILBOG. It's GOBLIN spelled backwards.

This is their kingdom.

Good morning. I am your neighbour.
I'm Creedence Leonore Gielgud.

Good morning.

Mum, i'm going for a walk.

Hello beautiful.
Hi.

She is very appetizing.

Appetizing?
Provocative.

I thought you might enjoy one of my ancient recipes.

It's a traditional dish in these parts.

Oh but you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble.

No trouble...

...really.

They're still here.

...symbol of original sin,

which is consumed, and caused the falling human race,

which is so dear to us.

FLESH! And by flesh i mean
all that stinking, disgusting meat.

Hamburgers, steaks, sausages,
and hotdogs sold by the side of the road.

The stink of smoked carcasses.

The humans nurse themselves with these.

Violating their own bodies,
infecting themselves.

Creating incurable elements, smelly bladders.
Nest of infection.

Vicious, stinky excrement.

Elliot! Elliot!

Holly, what a surprise.

Choose Elliot!
Either me or your friends!?

I don't understand.

Do you understand now?

Is it ready?
Here it is. Nice and creamy.

This is a wonderful cup of
Nilbog icecream for a little child.

You're gonna stuff yourself with it, don't you?
Kids with a sweet tooth like yours love icecream.

Help, grandpa Seth! HELP!

Hmmm, open your mouth my little friend.
Please, open it!

I won't. I don't want to.

Hmmm, open your mouth my little friend.
Please, open it!

No, I won't.

I don't want to.

Stop! What are you doing to my son?

We were giving him some icecream.

Daddy, they're goblins, monsterous beeings.

What?
They were giving me icecream,
so they can eat me later.

An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?

I mean look at them. They all have
a molded shape of a cloverleaf.
And Nilbog, it's goblin spelled backwards.

I'm telling you daddy, they're monsters.

Mr and Mrs Presents, what are you doing here?
I thought you supposed to be in my house.

We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.

Okay.

It was nice meeting all of you.
My son and i must be leaving now.

We need time for some things to happen.
We must have patience until tonight.

Christ!

What is it?
Your sister Holly's with
that playboy son of a Coopers.

Look, they're my friends. Allright?

Hey, wait, wait! Stop it!

Oh no!

So kids, how is life?
Listen, Mr Waits.

I don't want to have anything to do with you.
I don't speak to people who arrive
late and upset their girlfriends.

You give me a bad impression.

C'mon, dad!
We'll get in the car and talk, Holly. Okay?

Listen Mr Waits! We need to have a serious talk.
If you want to have a serious talk,
you have to forget about your friends

and come to our house.
Otherwise you can forget about Holly.

Allright. I'm coming.

Hey, wait a minute, Elliot.
You're gonna leave me here alone?
Yes.

But what do i tell to Drew and Arnold?
Tell them whatever you want.

What am i gonna do?
Take the camper. Do what you want.

And what about the beautiful liberated girls?

Is anyone here?

I feel so dizzy.

Drew! Over here!

Arnold?

Is that you?

Arnold, what happened?

What?

Get me out of here, Drew. Just get me out of here.
Okay, don't fret.

Hurry, before the crazy lady gets back.

Grab the pot, and drag me out. Quick!
I'll try.

Hurry!

What's wrong? Why did you stop?
I don't feel so good.

You gotta do it, man. Grab hold of the pot,
and pull with all of your strength.
We can get out of this nightmare. Hurry!

Hello!

Oh no.

You've been thinking of leaving us, little flower?

No, please, ma'am!

You will be punished for this.

No! Please, ma'am, i beg you!

What're you gonna do?
What're you gonna do to me with that?

I'm going to make a large brashness for your friend.

But this won't hurt you.

You'll just feel a little tickle, little flower.

What's going on here?

Oh, Michael!

Look, what a surprise they have prepared for us.

Finally! I'm so hungry.

What are you doing here, Elliot?
Mum, Elliot's part of the family now.

Oh, Elliot.

What a plesure to see you again, Mr Waits.
We wanted to make up with this
misunderstandment we got a little while ago.

Look! All the people of Nilbog have
decided to give you a party.
We even have a little food.

A little food? They prepared a whole feast.

<i>EAT UP!!</i>

Dance my children! Dance and eat! EAT!

No, don't eat that stuff. They're monsters.
They're all monsters. If you eat this stuff,
they'll kill us. They're goblins.

Joshua, I've had enough. I'm sick of this.
I want you to go to your room immediately.

Children's fancies. They will pass.

Of course.

Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Grandpa!

<i>ENJOY</i>

Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Answer me!

Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Come quick!

Grandpa Seth!

Help, grandpa Seth! Heeelp!

Grandpa!

We must move quickly to put out the fire.
What fire?

Guess!

That is enough.

We go around the house. When the time comes,
you light the wig and throw the bottle.

I'll create some confusion with this.

Hurry! Let's put some fuel on the fire.

Cut that out, kid!
You'll never be able to stop us.

And as for you old man:
Go back to your kingdom of shadows.

I order you...

...with the secret power of the magic stone:

Go back to hell!

Grandpa!

Grandpa!

Grandpa! Grandpa!

Joshua!

You'll have to do it yourself.

Are you really in hell?

No.

But I know a trick, that a friend
of mine who was there, taught me!

What happened?

Grandpa!

Oh my god! What is this?

He was one of us, and you killed him.
Now it's your turn.

Joshua!

Quick! In the house!

Oh lord of the magic rock Stonehenge!

Come and protect your children!

Come, and give us strength!

Give me all my old powers,
oh lord of the magic rock.

There are sandwiches for tonight in here.
It'll go easier if you eat them.

You'll make our work easier.
Otherwise, we'll be forced to kill you violently.

It would be a shame. The blood would
mix with the meat, and we'd have to put
them in vinegar for the whole night.

Oh dear god! What can we do?
We don't even have enough
weapons to defend ourselves.

Do something, Elliot, please!
I don't know what to do.

We need grandpa Seth here.
Joshua, grandpa Seth is dead.

I know he's dead, but until now
he's been the one helping us.

But how are we get him to come?
By holding a seance maybe?

You're a genius, big sister.

What the hell's wrong with this thing?

Do you like it?
Shall we eat it together?

What kind of show is this?

I'm not a programme.

I'm real. Come out, and you'll see.

Won't you invite me in?
Yeah. Of course.

How do you like it?

What's the matter? Aren't you hungry?

Actually, i like popcorn.

Well, no problem.
All we have to do is heat it up.

Nothing's happening.

Raise your hands!

Concentrate harder!

Grandpa Seth, come to us!

Let's show them we're still here.

Don't get distracted.

Concentrate harder!

Grandpa Seth, please come!

I don't like this.
Why don't they show any sign of life?

Grandpa, please come and help us!

Joshua! Joshua!

Dad!?

That's not possible.

I knew you wouldn't leave us, grandpa.

That's the voice of your grandpa?
Yes.

You have only ten minutes.
When that clock starts striking six,
i'll disappear. And now it is forever.

Together we can destroy the magic stone,
that gives the goblins their power.

Concentrate, Joshua! Concentrate!
Yes, grandpa.

Joshua!

Joshua!? Joshua!

Quick! Upstairs.

Michael!

Grandpa! Grandpa Seth, are you here?

Go away, monster!

Let's run!

Grandpa, where have you been?

Take this! Keep it!
You can only take out the contents,
when you really need it.

Do you understand?
I understand. And now?

Here it is. The Stonehenge magic stone.
The goblins' magic power.

What do we have to do, grandpa?
Touch it! Only touch it!

Will it work?

I hope so.

Please, let's talk!
We're all humans here.

No more. No more popcorn.

Our queen is calling us.

Joshua's alone right now. Let's go!

Grandpa! Nothing's happening.
Something has happened now, Joshua!

I'm leaving.
No grandpa, not now.

Joshua, I have to do this once again.

Remember: It's only the power of
goodness that can defeat the goblins.

Goodbye forever.
Goodbye, grandpa. Goodbye.

What were you going to do, little one?

Now, we're going to feed you, Joshua.

You've been fasting for two days.

You're hungry, right?

A double decker bologna sandwich.

Don't do it!

Think about the fuds in your blood.

Think about the cholesterol.

Think about the toxins.

No! No!

Joshua!

Grandpa Seth's voice brought us here.

Quick! Help me! Put your hands
on the stone and concentrate.

What?
Don't you see? Only the power of
goodness can destroy these monsters.

Put your hands on the stone!

Concentrate!

Concentrate more!

Concentrate!

I have to pass by the office.

I need to go home... for a while.
I'll come with you.

Joshua and I will wait for you at home.

Want some fruit, Joshua?
The fruit is still very good.

I don't want to eat for the next twenty years.

Uhm, it's delicious.

I think i'm going to my room to take a nap.
Good idea. I think i'll take a shower first.

I don't know how to thank you, grandpa.
I hope you're okay up there.

Mum?

<i>Yummy! Mom is so good</i>

Mummy!

They are eating my mom.
