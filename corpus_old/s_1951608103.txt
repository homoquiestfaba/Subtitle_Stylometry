Another nightmare?

I'm okay.

We launch a new campaign next week.

The Japanese are flying in Tuesday.

<i>The Times, The Herald,
and The Post are all running pieces...</i>

which is very exciting.

Karen Baldwin's office. Please hold.

Karen Baldwin.

Okay.

Thank you.

I love you...

so much.

Me, too.

Always my favorite.

That's why I want you
to have the summer house.

The last time you were there...

was the summer I was in Europe
with Aunt Betty.

You were 13, I think.

Wendy was 11.

Your grandfather loved that house.

Especially when you girls were there.

<i>Clean it up...</i>

<i>sell it...</i>

<i>and get married.</i>

So, how long did your grandparents
live here for?

Oh, God. As long as I can remember.

I spent every summer there till I was 13.

That's a lot of memories.

What the hell is that?

What is it?

A deer.

You get them?
Got them.

Here we are.

Got the key?
Yeah.

Thanks.

Great.

Wow.

It's gonna take a little longer
than a weekend to clean it.

It's different than I remember it.

It used to seem so much bigger to me,
you know?

I know.

Actually used to get lost around there
all the time.

Spiders seem to like it.

This your grandfather?

Yeah.

Jeff?

Jeff!

What?
Rats!

Where?
God damn it, there are rats in there!

In the breadbox, there are rats!

God damn it!

Don't laugh at me! There are rats in there!

The most powerful woman in publicity.

Shut up, it's not funny.
Come on, it's just a couple of rats.

Jeff.
It's all right.

Don't laugh at me.

Just a little rodent.
They're so big.

Great with garlic.
Shut up.

Two rooms down and 11 to go.

Thank you for being here.

What else are boyfriends for?

You know what I was thinking?

Maybe I could stay a few more days.

You can't.

You have a new job, and I am fine.

I can handle it.
You need to stop worrying about me.

If you think...
I think.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

What is it?

Nothing.

Hey.

Let's relax, okay?

I'm relaxed.

I'm fine.
Okay.

Wait. Wait.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

This was their room, you know?
And this was their bed. It's kind of weird.

Pick a room.

Any room at all.

God damn it! Jeff!
What? You were gone, I got worried.

God, you scared me.

You scared me, too.

What were you doing?
What was I doing?

Looking for my girl.
Besides, what are you doing?

Excuse me, your horse was...

Who are you?

I look after this place.

I don't know if anyone's told you yet...

but my grandmother just passed away.

She's dead? Shame.

We're packing up the place.
We're gonna sell it.

I see.

I had no idea
there were still horses around here.

Yep.

Do you take care of them, too?
I mean, the house, the horses...

It must be a lot of work.

Not if you like them.

You can tame them.
They know who's the boss.

And if they're gonna be ridden...

Well...

I fell off one once when I was younger.
Been kind of terrified of them ever since.

Well, you're not a little girl anymore,
are you?

Maybe it's time you ride again.

No. No, not for me. Thanks.

Afraid you're gonna fall?

Don't be afraid. I won't let it happen.

Go on, now.

I should... I'm gonna get back to packing.

Name's Pierce.
Karen.

I know.

Don't be a stranger, now.

Just some blown fuses.

What is this?

Where did that come from?

I think they got it in Italy
on their honeymoon.

It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's really pretty.

Where are we going for our honeymoon?

Jeff...

I'm gonna go finish in the other room.

Do you have any masking tape?

You don't have to get married.

Sorry, I fell asleep.

Well, wake up.

What's wrong?

I hate the idea of leaving you here.
I'll be fine.

No, it's just...

That.

How about I promise...

that I will call you later?

You better call me later.
I will.

I miss you already.
Yeah, me, too.

Now go.

Stop worrying about me. I'm fine.
Okay.

Okay?
All right.

Okay.

Drive safely.

All righty.

Hello?

Is somebody there?

I got you. I got you, darling.

I won't let you fall. I won't let you fall.

You okay?

I won't let you fall.

I got you.

I won't let you fall.

Great.

Do you have a car?
A car, do you have a car?

A car!
No.

Damn it!

Sorry. Shit. Sorry.
It's okay.

It's broke.

It's okay, you're safe now. I'm here.

Are you all right?

I'll close the door, okay?

God, what is going on?

Hell if I know, I just heard screaming,
and I ran up there, it was raining women.

Yeah, I know...

it's modest...

but it's my home.

Have you really been to all these places?
No, don't. Please, don't.

I mean, they're mine.

It's sentimental.

Your hands are shaking.

Here, come on.

Why don't you sit down?

Here.

Drink this.

Thanks.

So, you didn't answer me before.

You've really been to all those places?
All of them.

Up here.

It's amazing where the mind will take you,
if you let it.

But...

you mean you've never actually
traveled anywhere?

Why? Just be disappointed.

It'd never be as good as my book.

Up here, it's always the way I want it.

People are nice...

warm beaches...

everything, you know? Happy endings.

Want to come with me?

You're tired. Why don't you...

You need to get some rest, anyway.
Come on.

Get in the bed.

No, I'll take the couch.
No, I sleep on the couch.

What?
I... Oh.

I always sleep on the couch.
Oh.

Then I'll take the bed.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Don't worry.

Horses will let you know
if anyone comes around, okay?

Thanks.

I have a boyfriend.

I know.

Just in case.

You never know. Okay?

All right.

Good night.

Hey.

Hey.

Sleep well?

Yeah. I did, actually. Thanks.

I don't know.

Maybe I'm just losing it.

Maybe I dreamed it, I don't know.
I mean, you saw, right?

When we went back into the house,
everything was fine.

Ain't nothing to fear...

But that big old horse.

He's nice.

Hey, what do you say
we go for a walk, huh?

Sure.

You behave.

Oh, your boot.

Ready?

I've never been out this far.

Really?

Yeah, my grandfather never let us.
He said it was too dangerous.

Really?

These woods are...

They're beautiful. Peaceful.

Nothing to be afraid of.

You gonna miss this place?
Of course.

But, you know,
the people, the places, who we love...

they're always with us.

Wow.

Look at that.

You okay?

Oh, my God.

You're making a habit of saving me, huh?

Yeah, looks like you had to be saved
from yourself, huh?

Let's go, come on. Come on.

You started without me.

Wendy! I can't believe you're here.

Oh, my God!

Oh, gosh.

Oh, honey!

Hi.
Hi.

Wait, how did you get in?
The front door.

Oh.

Gosh, it's crazy. It's just like I remember it.

Really? It seems so much smaller to me.

It is so good to see you.

Oh, look at that. Mom and Dad.

I love that picture.
They're so cute there.

No, look at this.
Were we, like, the cutest kids?

Oh, God, yeah.

Look at you here.

That's not cute.
No.

Morning.
Morning.

Oh, Pierce, this is Wendy.
Hi.

My little sister.
Really? Sisters.

Yeah, Pierce is the caretaker around here.

Oh, well, nice to meet you.

Oh. The pleasure's mine.

Would either of you like some breakfast?

Oh, no, thanks. We're fine...
Hey, speak for yourself.

I would love some breakfast.
I'd love to make you some.

Okay.

Thanks.
Thank you.

Where's your food? Aren't you gonna eat?

I already did.

Be careful with that one.

Why? Is he dangerous?

No, nothing like that, he's just...

Oh, I don't know.
There's just something about him.

You're so overprotective.
I know, I know.

Remember the summer
that I begged you to teach me how to kiss...

but you kept telling me no?

I had just met Joey,
and you told me I was too young.

Yeah.

I remember.

I remember that summer.

Oh, honey! God!

Come here, come here. Oh, God.

Is it bad?
Lean your head back.

Oh.
Lean your head back.

Hey.
What are you doing?

Looking for you.
For me?

For you.

Must be nice, you and your sister
together again...

like you used to be.
Yeah, like we used to be.

Have a swing?
Swing?

Have a swing. What do you say?
Okay.

I'll push you.
Yeah.

Ready?
Yeah.

Okay.

You're good at this.

Oh!

I got you.

You okay?
Yeah. You scared me.

I wouldn't have let you fall, honey.

Hey.

So this how you pick the wood, okay?
Okay.

Like that, like that.
Okay.

And now you go...

Okay. Okay.
Easy.

No, you go on first. I wanna watch you first.
Okay.

With your left hand.

Okay.

Okay, hold on. Let me get a good one.
Okay.

Is that one good?
Hey.

Hey.
Hey.

Show your sister what you can do.
How's the packing going?

It's coming. I could use your help, though.

Okay, hold on one second,
I wanna show you something.

Watch what your sister can do.

You ready? Okay.
Now.

Yeah!

I think that was pretty good.
Pretty good? It was great.

Okay, so I'm gonna go back up,
and you'll come up?

Yeah, I'll be right up.
Okay.

<i>- Wait, wait.
No, I cannot find it. Let's go.</i>

<i>Stop catching me.</i>

<i>Come on, Karen.</i>

<i>It's time to play.</i>

Remember, you're gonna tell me
whenever you need to go...

Go to the bathroom, blow my nose,
get a glass of water.

I'll keep you updated.

Look, I can't explain why.
It's just, I don't...

What?

I'm your sister. You can tell me anything.

No, it's nothing.
There's nothing to tell, it's just...

Look, it's for me, okay?
I'm a big scaredy-cat.

I know that.
So will you stay with me, just tonight?

Like, in the bed with you?
Yeah, like, right here.

And you promise not to hog all the covers?

I promise not to steal all the covers.

Okay, I'm sold.
You're sold?

Yes, but you have to snuggle in,
because you're gonna take them...

and I'm gonna be, like, sleeping
on the other side of the bed with nothing.

Come on, snuggle close.
Spoon me.

Karen?

Karen, it's Wendy.

Karen, open the door.

Karen!

What's going on?

They're getting so real.
What is?

Karen, what are you talking about?

It was just a dream.

Just a bad dream.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Oh, God.

God, look at you.

I'm okay.

What?

Karen, hey, what?

Karen, what's going on?

I feel like we haven't done this in so long.

Just hang out
and play with each other's hair.

I remember the first book I read
in this library.

<i>- Yeah?
Snow White.</i>

I made Mom read me that book
so many times.

Except she left out the part
of the evil queen...

because you got too scared.

I would sneak the book under the covers
and read that part myself.

Yeah, and then you cried yourself to sleep.
I did not!

Okay, maybe a little bit.

I miss them.

I know.

You are such a brat.

You didn't!

Stop it.
That hurt me.

Hey.

Ready for that ride yet?

Go on, go.

Come on, one hour.

Still scared? I won't let you fall. Come on.

Two, three, and up. There you go.

Now here, put these in your right hand.

Okay. Now, don't...

Hey, don't squeeze with your legs,
you hear me?

Don't squeeze with your legs,
and just relax.

Don't fight it. Hang on.

If you get afraid, you just grab here, okay?

And just enjoy the ride. All righty? Let's go.

Come on.

Come on.

Relax.

Wendy?

It's a dream.

It's a dream, it's a dream, it's a dream.

It's a dream.

<i>Karen.</i>

<i>Come on, Karen.</i>

<i>It's time to play.</i>

<i>Karen.</i>

<i>Oh, Karen.</i>

<i>It's time to play.</i>

<i>- Give it to me, you stupid...
No! Stop it! It's my doll!</i>

<i>- Give it to me now.
No, I don't want...</i>

Wendy, stop. Give it to me.
No!

Karen, no! It's mine.
Stop it. It's mine!

It's my favorite doll!
It's mine!

No! Stop!

No, it's mine.
Mine.

Waiting for a good pitch?

Whoa!

Take it easy, slugger.
How did you get in here?

Oh, I was just checking up on you.
Making sure you're okay. You okay?

Yeah?

No. No, no, no.

No, no, no. Pierce, no, no, no.
What?

Wait, this is wrong.
Why?

No. No, no, no. No. No.

I said, quiet.

I got you. I got you.

I got you. I got you, darling.

I got you.

Let's go. Get up.

Hey, I been reading some of the books
in the library.

Read much history? Huh?

It's good stuff.
I just read this one about a Doctor...

Josef Mengele.

He was something.

Hey, come on.

He was special.
He was a special kind of guy...

and he saw himself as a scientist
more than as a doctor.

He did these studies. With twins, you see.

He'd separate them.

He'd put one in a little room...

and he'd have someone watch her...

you know, real close.

Meanwhile, in the next room,
he has the other twin...

strapped down to some kind of,
you know, operating table...

and he'd start doing things to her.

He'd start out kind of small.
Maybe cut off her finger or an ear and...

Karen. Karen.

Now, they're strapped down...

and the room is soundproof...

and she's screaming.

Can you imagine that? Imagine it, okay?

Imagine this.

The other one in the other room,
you know...

doesn't know anything.

Meanwhile, the doctor's torturing away now.

Karen, this is my very favorite part...

so listen. My very favorite part.

Now, he stops torturing, this doctor does...

and he goes across the hall
to that very next room...

and he asks her, he goes,
"Hey, little girl, how you feeling?

"How you feeling?"

See, he wanted to show some kind of link.

Karen, what are you doing?

Get up! I'm trying to teach you something
about history.

Yeah. Go. Let's go.

She's not linked, you see. He brings the...

He brings the one twin some food
to see if she can eat...

and he asks her if it tastes good...

and she says, "Hey, tastes great.
Where's my comic book?"

Wild stuff.

Oh, he cut the other one's tongue off.
That was the thing about the food.

My girlfriend is staying up at the house
on Mission Road.

On Mission Road, yes.

Yes, that's the one. Yeah, I can't reach her.

I don't know what's going on
with the phones up there.

Yeah, no, I haven't heard from her since
I dropped her off a couple of days ago.

That's correct. Can someone please go
and check on her for me?

Morning. You sleep well?

Karen, is something wrong?

What?

Did you hear that? It's Wendy.

Here. Put something on, okay?

I'll see.

Hey, you.
Hey.

I got it. Can you get that one?
Yeah.

Remember this? We used to love this.

Ma'am. I'm Deputy Anderson.

Hello.

We received a call from your boyfriend.

Says he's been having trouble
getting through.

I just stopped by
to see if everything was all right.

Yeah. Everything's fine.

You mind if I have a look around?

Oh, no, go ahead.

All right.
Thank you.

Well...

everything looks okay to me, ma'am.

Okay, thanks.

Have a nice day.
You, too.

What did he want?

Nothing. He was just checking on me.

Yeah?

Yeah.

I'll take much better care of you
than him, okay?

Badge or no badge.

Do you have the keys?
Yeah, why?

Give them to me.

Come on.

Look, tell me what's going on.
Just give them to me!

Karen, just talk to me.
Just trust me.

Hey...
Get in.

Are you serious?
Yeah, come on.

Okay.

Oh, no.

Shit!

Did I leave the lights on?

I don't think it was you.

Wendy.

Wendy? Wendy!

Get off her, you fuck!

No, you can't dance worth a shit.

Wendy!

Can you? It's a yes-or-no question.

Wendy!
Can you dance?

I thought so, honey.

Well, maybe there's something
you do better.

Let's find out. Let's find out
what you do better than dance.

You know?

Shut up! Don't cry.

Don't cry.

It upsets me. It makes me feel bad.

Now, maybe, just maybe...

there's something
you do better than dance...

'cause you can't dance worth a shit.

Is there?

Why did you tempt me like this,
Wendy, huh? Why?

Why did you tempt me like this?

Wendy, why?

Why did you do this to me?

Why, Wendy, why? When I like you, honey.

I like you, Wendy!

Why? Wendy?

Wendy, don't cry. Don't cry, Wendy.

Don't... Please? Don't cry, Wendy. Wendy.

Wendy, I'll stab you if you continue to cry.
So don't.

Now, I wanna know...

why did you do this to me...

when I like you?

I like you! Wendy, I like you!

God damn it! I like you, you dumb bitch!

Now shut the fuck up.

Let's find out
what you do better than dance.

I got an idea. I got an idea!

I just got an idea!

I got an idea.

Hey.

Where are you going?

Where are you going?

I'm sorry.
Shut up!

I'll cut your throat. Shut up. Hey, shut up.
Want me to cut your throat?

Want me to cut your throat?
No.

No! No!
You gonna listen to me? Be quiet.

Then be quiet.

Want me to cut your throat?
I can't hear you!

Now, calm down and talk to me.

Oh, please, please.

Please, please, no.

Go!

Safety off?

Better check.
Back off! Back off!

Back off!

Run!

You actually think I kept this thing loaded?

Come here!

You stabbed me.

No...

that wasn't very nice.

Look at me.

Can you get up? Can you get up? Wendy?

I need you to run. Okay? Come on.

Come on.

No. No. No.

I'm so sorry.
No, no, it's okay, baby.

I didn't know.
I know. It's not your fault.

Let's just get out of here together, okay?

Come on. Come on.

Wendy.

Wendy. Wendy!

Hurt, Karen?

Bye-bye, Wendy.

Hello, Karen.

Wendy.

No.

Jeff?

What? What's wrong?

She's dead.
What?

She's dead. She's dead.

Who's dead?

Wendy. Wendy.
Wendy?

My sister, Wendy.

Honey...

Wendy's been dead for 17 years.

He was just here. He was just here.

He was just here. He was...

You all right?

I am now.

I love you.
I love you, too.

You ready?

Yeah.

Let's go.
