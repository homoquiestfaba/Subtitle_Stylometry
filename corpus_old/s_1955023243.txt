Here, Amber.

Oh, you're the best.

So what are you,
like 40 now?

Ha, funny.

It looks so yummy.

Thank you.

You're the best.

Oh, no problem.

So what are you
working on?

This insane
history paper.

Hm.

When are your exams?

In a couple weeks.

I have so much to do.

Ugh, brutal.

You should have
majored in photography.

November 17.

I still have a shit ton
of prints to get framed.

Want to make some money?

Um, you can have
half of the cupcake?

Uh, no.

I've already had
like three.

So, um, you're still coming
to the Ghost Children show

Tonight, right?

The weird local band?

Where the guys wear
mini-skirts and throw fake
dead rats

Into the crowd?

Yes, but it's Halloween.

Plus, Jared may be there.

And we have to do something
for your birthday.

I'll buy your first
beer as a legal adult.

Well, in that case, I think
I can make an appearance.

But I won't be there until
later because I don't get
off work

Till about 10:00

That's cool.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So I'll see you
later tonight.

Come find me.
I should be with Stephanie.

All right.

I'll be there
around 11:00.

OK, cool.

Happy birthday.

Thanks again for
the cupcakes.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

What are you guys doing?

Oh, nothing.

What's going on, Jackie?

Aren't those Ian's
jack o'lanterns

That he spent
forever working on?

Yeah.

But they sucked anyway.

That fucker.

He took a shit in my
Halloween mask last night.

This is just
the beginning.

All right.

Well, you guys
have fun with that.

I'll see you at the
party later on tonight.

the party tonight.

Mm-hmm.

Later, Jackie.

Wear something sexy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Blah.

Hello, Jackie.

I'm sorry for running
into you, Professor Lynch.

I'm quite OK.

I didn't mean to
frighten you.

Oh, it's OK.

I was just turning
in my paper.

(Professor lynch) And are you
happy with how it turned
out?

Kind of.

There's just so many
theories behind Stonehenge.

Oh, you chose to write about
the origin of Stonehenge?

Yeah.

I have always been
fascinated with it.

(Professor lynch) Did
you come across any

Of the Druidic theories
in your research?

Yeah.

Some people believe
that they created it.

And then some believe that's
where they [INAUDIBLE]

And they based their
calendar off of it.

That's right.

The Druidic calendar
was an eternal cycle

Of death and rebirth.

Samhain, the
festival of the dead.

Or, Halloween as
you and I know it.

It was one of the most
important festivals

On the Druidic calendar.

It marked the end of fall
and the beginning of winter.

Crops were harvested and
everyone would celebrate.

Huge bonfires were lit to
guide the dead on their
journey.

And to keep them
away from the living.

It was the only day
the ghosts of the dead

Were able to mingle
with the living.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


Hey.

Hey.

Well, happy Halloween.

And sorry again for
running into you.

Best of luck on
your paper, Jackie.

I'm sure you'll do fine.

Have a nice night.

Thanks.

I'll see you on Monday.

Oh, and, uh, Jackie?

Happy birthday.

Thanks.

Honestly, am I the
only one doing anything

Productive today?

Hey, it was
Stephanie's idea.

What else could you possibly
be wanting to do today?

Uh, elbow sex.

Having a homosexual
boxing match.

Ooh.

Flying to transsexual
Transylvania.

Reading the
Danton Affair.

Great scott.

Join us.

Hey, did you get your
paper done today?

Yeah, I actually just
went and turned it in.

I have so much
left to do.

I'm so screwed.

Well, your costume
looks beautiful.

Well, don't dream
it, be it.

Now, please help us
TP this fucking tree.


Hey, Jackie.

Oh, hey, Christine.

Ooh, wait.

This is not a good
look for you.

You know you're not
getting in without an ID.

It's in my room,
Christine.

Well then, you can
take that bozo with you.

Oh, no.

He's all yours.

Ew.

Oh.

Score.

Where in the world does
she get these things?

[PHONE RINGING]


Hello?

(Jackie's dad (on
phone)) Jackie.

Oh, hey, Dad.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Hey, I thought

You might be
Carrie again.

Happy birthday.

Oh, thanks.

And no, she went to get
a costume at last minute.

(Jackie's dad (on phone)) She
wears a costume every day.

Dad, leave her alone.

So what are you
up to tonight?

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Well, Jeremy and I

Are going to scare all
the neighborhood kids.

We actually turned the
garage into a haunted house

Like we used to when
you were a little girl.

Really?

Did you bring out
the spaghetti guts?

(Jackie's dad
(on phone)) No.

What about the ooze rats
or the fishing pole bats?

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Yeah, rats are all out.

Your brother climbed
halfway up the way

And hung up the bats
from the ceiling.

Dad, you better make
sure he's careful.

He really shouldn't
being doing that.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Oh, Jackie.

He's fine.

So what are you doing
tonight for your big 21?

God, 21 years old.

I can't believe it.

You're not going to get
too shit-faced tonight?

I have to work, but
that's a possibility.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Lord knows I got shit-faced

When I turned 21.

I'm just kidding.

There's a show on campus and
all my friends are going.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
That sounds nice.

Be careful and keep
in touch, Jackie.

Have you talked to Mom?

(Jackie's dad (on phone)) No,
not... not in a couple
weeks.

I don't know what
to say to her.

You know she doesn't want
to talk to me, Jackie.

I know.

But I really think you should
take Jeremy to see her.

She really wants
to see him.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Look, Jackie.

I don't have the
time or the money

To be dragging back
and forth for her.

You started looking
for a new job yet?

No, I have a lot going
on at school right now.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Well, maybe

If you weren't going
to these parties,

You could find something.

You know what?

You are so unreal.

I am doing everything that
I can and I have no time

To deal with
this right now.

I'll talk to you later.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Jackie, wait.

Just we can't afford
this that much longer.

I know.

I am doing everything
that I can.

I will talk to you later.

(Jackie's dad (on phone))
Call me later.

Bye.



Oh my god.

These bitches are crazy.

Did you see that
mess out there?

It looks like a pack
of mummies exploded.

Ooh.

What's going
on, you guys?

Which one of you
wants the next ride?

Come on, Eddie.

Come on.

See you later tonight.


Later, wasteoid.

The costume shop was
totally out of everything.

For the power of
Grayskull, I am She-Ra.

So what are you
going as this year?

Oh, come on, Jackie.

Do I really have
to dress up?

I don't have anything.

Look, I know Halloween isn't
your favorite time of year.

But you been
working so hard.

You need a break.

Plus, it's your birthday.

I'm sorry, Jackie.

It's OK.

I've just had a
really weird semester.

I know.

You've done
everything you can do.

You deserve to have a
little fun on your birthday.

You've worked harder than
anyone in this building,

I can tell you that.

These girls are too
busy buying toilet paper

To get anything done.

I know.

And I'm not
cleaning that up.

Hell no.

The princess of power
does not clean up shit.

Surprise.

Got you again.

I hate you guys.

Why do you guys do this

Yeah.

But at this point,
everything just

Seems to be
running together.

Oh, come on.

You're going to do fine.

You've had your head in these
books for the past two
weeks.

You probably just absorbed
all the information.

I'm just scared because my
mom, she's now living with
me aunt.

And my dad went
back to Ohio.

And if I don't
pass this semester,

I don't know how I'm
going to pay for school.

They're definitely
getting a divorce now?

Yeah.

My dad, he went and filed
for it and everything.

Oh, Jackie.

Try not to worry.

It's probably
for the best.

Your brother couldn't
have caused all of this.

know it just sucks.

Oh, Jackie.

Oh, that's right.

Today is your birthday.

How on earth
could I forget?

Jackie, you should have
told me and I would

Have given you
the night off.

It's all right.

I'd rather work.

I need the money anyways.

Your favorite song.

Weirdest song ever.

Come on.

No way.

Is Jordan going to
break up with me?

I'll bet you haven't even
gotten to second base yet?

Oh, yes I have.

At least I think I have.

What's second base again?

I'll show you what
second base is.

Remember that?
Right over there.

He used to really
be scared.

OK.

It's time for me to ask
Alexander a question.
