After my mother's death, I
have been fond of reading.

And I started to love staying home.

Hate seeing my father's girlfriend, May.

I'm really afraid of seeing them.

They think I'm cute, that's okay.

But why do they have to
pinch my face! It hurts!

Elaine, come on! Be good.
I'm not finished reading.

Come on! Come with me to see Auntie May.

I don't want to see Auntie May!

Come on!

How much is it?
Fifty dollars.

I don't want it!

What is it?
What are you doing scarring her!

Don't be afraid! Get lost!

We are leaving now, don't be afraid.

I started to think about being
pinched on the face again,

It scares me and makes me cry even more.

That boy and his dog are so disgusting!

I am so afraid of dogs.

Why do boys like to play with
such horrible animals?

I don't understand.

However, when I think of the boy,
he looked brave!

He's like the prince who saved the princess
as described in the story book I'm reading.

He is the prince, and I am the princess.

The prince used the sword to kill
the monster and saved the princess.

Then, they lived happily ever after.

When I was small...

I always wish my Prince of
Charming would appear soon.

And take me away.

Jennifer...

Boatman, I want to buy a bookshelf.

Bookself!
Don't need to buy, I'll make one for you.

Okay! Do it when you are free.

Free day, Why?
I'm a man of his word, Today is the day!

Do it right after lunch!

Bath Tub!

Desk!

Big window seeing Brooklyn Bridge.
I've painted it in three days.

Do you like it?
I like it!

I hope one day I could open
a small restaurant here.

When that happens, I think most of
my friends will not be at my side...

Maybe, you'll leave me too.

Maybe I'll still be around.

If you're still here, we can
watch the waves together.

What's the name of your restaurant?

Do you have any suggestion?

Did your English teacher
give you a Christian name?

Yes, it is Samuel Pang!

Then, let's call it Sampan.

Boatman, where have you been?

Let me tell you, I'll teach
a lesson to those people...

who offend the members of
the Chinese Association!

That's right, we'll go kick his ass!

Boatman, don't go!

Jenny

Jenny, the two of you are different people.
Leave me alone!

I once knew a friend...

His biggest wish was to open
a restaurant called Sampan!

Jenny, is it like that one?

Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!

Bye!

Table for two?

From that moment,

I don't want to wait for a prince,
and I don't want to be a princess.

I want to fall in love with
a man just like Boatman!

A man who is simple, brave
and direct about love.

My honeymoon will certainly be in New York.

I want to visit the places where
Boatman and Thirteen lived.

I want to experience their love.

Bye

Washington, you're back!

Really? Ming sees Ha's...

relatives and friends...
Everybody here

Let them wait for a few minutes.
I'll be there soon.

Don't hit my car!

I've told you many times!
When you deliver goods, park at the back!

I am not delivering, I'm
picking up my girlfriend.

Does your girlfriend live here?

Which floor? What is her name?

Hello

Washington...

They...

They are a bit upset.

Hang on! I'll be right there!

They've started to blame each other
for the death of their children.

They are fighting now!

Hi! Honey!

Hi! May I help you?

What's wrong, you almost hit him?

He has a poor attitude!
You can file a complain!

You won't resolve the problem
by scaring him like that.

Well!

How long is your trip?

I don't know!

What's going on?

Hi! Honey, how are you doing?

I see...
I'm heading for the airport!

Keep one party in the hall and the other in the garden

Just try to separate them.

What? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

You mean... you gonna meet me there?

Of course, I miss you.
I know!

Listen, I'll be right there!
Don't mess it up.

Bye!

Okay...

Don't give me trouble! Just fix it!

Okay! Coming...

Stop! Everyone stops!

Listen carefully, everyone!

That day, your son, the dog,
and your daughter, the cat,

were fighting for a dead fish.

They fought in the middle of the road,
both were struck and killed by a car.

You were on the plane?

Without you, I don't want to go anywhere.

It hurts me! Do you have a beard?

Stay where you are...

I want to...
I want to sleep with you.

Where's everyone?

Seeing you like that, everyone left.

Why didn't you wake me up?

We want you to... see her everyday.

Dear princess, come back to me...

Fang, come over and have a cup of tea.

Leave the young couple alone.

Have some tea, come on!
Okay, let's have some tea...

Elaine is not a little girl anymore.
That's right.

She has known Ricky for ages, why not...

I know what you are going to say...

Let me arrange it, make it a big party.

Great idea!
Come, let's have some tea...

That feels good!

Am I rude?

I pretended to be a lady
in front of our family.

Let me take a look! There
is sand in your eye...

Not in my eye, it's in my nose.

But why do you rub your eyes?

The nose and eyes are
connected, stupid fool!

Let me blow it away for you.

It's useless, I'll dig it out.

I feel so comfortable now.

Oh! Hold my leg!

The gap between my third and
fourth toes... it's itchy!

Please scratch it for me...

Can you accept that?

You're a special girl.

Don't you see that, we are
not right for each other?

No, my mother said we're a perfect...

Perfect for what?

You're beautiful, you look like a good mother
We're just perfect...

Let me tell you,
I'm taking you to meet Ricky tomorrow.

When you see him, say something
nice to him, got it?

I've got a boyfriend already.

I know, that poor, uneducated
and not civilized triad.

He loves you for your money!

What is his name?

Eason.

No, Emesson, no Erickson.

His name is Edison!

You don't even know his name,
how do you know his character?

I do not need to know his name.
I know he's cheating you!

How do you know it?

Trust me before it's too late!

Is it too late? Did you...

I'm not answering.

I want to throw up...

Daddy, do you like a grandson
or a granddaughter?

Sandy!
Sir.

Keep an eye on Elaine, don't let her go out.
Yes!

Doggie! Sit!

Sandy, please let me go!

I am so smart to borrow this dog from Chan!

Sandy, you're so ungrateful!

You always said you have muscular pains,

You said helping you to clean the
floor would make your pain go away.

I always know you were lying to me.

But you've taken care of me for many years,
I wanted to give you a hand!

Sandy, I always treat you like my mom.
Please let me go!

Okay! Go quickly, go, go!

Doggie! Come back!

Go! I can't stop it any longer!

I took Pansy's phone by mistake!

Who is Pansy?
She is my little God-sister.

Little God-sister? How come there is a
sticker of the two of you on the phone?

It was taken some time ago!

We are as close as real sister and brother!

I see!

Why didn't you wait for
me before checking in?

I don't want you to know how
much luggage I'm bringing.

Why do you bring so much luggage with you?
Are you running away?

It's hot, so I bought more
clothes to change into.

And I've brought this painting,
I want to finish for you.

I'll let you see?

No, it's quite inconvenient here.

Actually, you should finish it first!
Show it to me when it is finished, right?

That's right.

Wait here...

Excuse me!
Excuse me, let me help you.

Oh! Thank you.

Let me help you, take care...

No! I am afraid of dogs!
Don't panic!

Doggie, let me show you to your master.

What are you thinking about?

Edison...

I had a nightmare, it's horrible!

It's just a dream! Don't need to be scared.

In my dream, I was no longer rich.
Therefore, you left me.

Silly girl! I love you, not your money.

No matter who you are,
I love you forever.

What are you laughing at?

I am laughing because you
trust people too easily.

Excuse me, did I take your girlfriend or
killed your parents? What did I do to you?

I am sorry. You are wrong on both.
First, I am an orphan, second, I am a gay.

It's not wise to trust easily in this world,

why not ask God! That's
the Lie Testing Stone.

It punishes those people who lie about love.

Punishes, how?

See the handicapped beggar over there?

He used to be very handsome.

To bad he didn't treat love seriously.

Before he never had a job,
he lived of women's money.

One day, he came with a woman to swear
in front of the Lie Testing Stone,

He had guts to lie in front of it,

when he put his hand into the stone's mouth,
and said his lie,

the 'Lie Testing Stone' bit
his hand off because he lied.

His hand... was forever gone.

Why don't you ask him to try?
Just try, you shouldn't be afraid.

Try it.

Do you trust him?

Okay, let's try in front of him.

Do you mean it?

Of course! Tell the world
that you love me, come on!

Waits! What if he makes a mistake
and bites my hand off...

how can I put on our wedding ring?

Would you marry me?

It was worth it running away
from home because of you.

My father always wants
me to marry a rich guy.

I hate it, that's why I ran away.

He got mad and said he wouldn't
give me money to spend anymore.

I didn't know how to tell you...
I don't know how you'll respond.

Are you sure your father will
stop giving you money?

It's Okay, I'll always be with you.

Just as long as we are together, we'll
be able to face any difficulties.

Getting married is a real big thing.

First, let's find the biggest
church on this island.

Then we'll ask the priest
to host our wedding.

And, we'll invite everyone on this
island to attend our wedding.

I'll put the wedding ring on your
finger in front of everyone.

What do you think?

Glad you agree.

Let's go.

Sit down! Wait for me!

He is for really!

Although I have no more money, he
is willing to married with me.

He is now going to look for a priest.

Miss, forget it! No more
money, he's not come back!

Pansy, how are you? I am your
God-brother's girlfriend.

He's gone to do something,
but he's left for hours.

I only have your number, what is his number?

0932717249!
Thank you!

I am not his God-sister,
I am his wife! Bitch!

Elaine! Wait for me, I'll be back soon.

Do you want to leave me?

Don't be silly! I won't do that.

My father will never support me.

My father and my relationship is finished.

Okay, thank you.

Your credit card is not effective,
do you have another one?

I'll cut it for you.

This card doesn't work
either, I'll cut it too.

No...
No way!

Anything for sale?

Excuse me...

Do you want to buy a computer?

No!
Are you kidding me?

This is a great computer...
Let me introduce it to you...

This is the latest model,
you'll find it great...

Come on, take a look!
No, I don't want it.

Just take a look!

No! I don't want it.

What do you want? I have
many things for sale.

That one.
The suitcase?

Robbery! Help! Robbery!

Stop the robber!

How dare you take my seat!
Get lost, get lost...

Bitch! Pick up your book.

Am I pretty?
Very pretty!

Thirteen, you came a long
way to study in the USA,

you'd make good use of your time to study.

That bastard doesn't like
you, you know that.

Why don't you just give up?

He likes me!

You don't have to wait for him to say no!

Look at you! You don't have
to torture yourself.

Boatman is someone who's not gentle at all.

He always tells you the truth
which hurts you badly.

Although it's painful, it's useful.

I have decided to forget him.

From now on, Edison will be
a meaningless name to me.

What a coincidence! Edison again?

First night for free?

Please help me.

I have talked too much.
I told you not to do it.

You are 80 kilos and you
want to hold it to sleep.

It needs to breathe too.

Next time...

It's about life! You are no different
from an insane killer.

Also, looks at you. Look at yourjewels.

Excuse me, do you have any vacant room?

Yes, please wait a moment.

Take away these five with you.

Get away, insane killer, I
don't want to see you again.

Please help me one more time!
No! You'd better leave now.

Why are you so hard-hearted?

Her dog died, you shouldn't hurt her.

Who are you?

My name is Elaine.

Where have you been?

I worry about you so much!

Baby

Don't come over.

Help!

Are you okay? How can you get
drown in shallow water?

Do you need a room?

I don't want to live next to the graveyard.

Don't touch!

I want to check-in.

There are many dead bodies around.

First night for free?

Checking in immediately.

Last room available.

Move, woman!

Wait!

You...

Do you think it's good
to hang it here? Move!

Ed... what?

It's Edison!

What do you want now!

There is something wrong with
the mattress, change it please.

You're crazy.
No way!

I want to sleep!

It's past midnight, I do want to sleep too,
just use the mattress for one night!

But the mattress makes sounds
that goes Ed, Ed...

It reminds me of my boyfriend, Edison!

This motel is named Edison, too.

When I think of him, I can't sleep.
When I can't sleep, I'll think of Edison.

He ran away after proposing to me.

You are only heart broken, right?

I want to sleep...
Someone like you had a boyfriend!

I want to sleep...
I am not refusing to change it for you,

but I don't have any mattress to change?

Miss, be rational.

I want to sleep...

Be rational, okay?

You are not leaving?

Open the door!

Okay!

Goodbye, Miss Chan!

Miss Chan, I lost my schoolbag.

Thank you, Miss Chan!

Pervert!

Mo... Mo

What's up?

You're going to be daddy
soon, I am pregnant!

I want it too...

Sleep in my bed, it will bring you luck!
Oh yeah!

Hey
Hello!

Are you on vacation?

How long will you stay? Do
you know how to play...

Mahjong?

Oh yeah!

So impolite! What a weird person!

Mahjong for five?

It's a funny game, you'll find it interesting

It sounds complicated, but it's very simple.
Yes, it's really fun!

Let me speak, okay?
Okay.

This mahjong game for five...

is the combination of all
sorts of mahjong games.

And it combines some rules of show
hand, bridge and Tien-kau...

The rules are therefore...
Not simple!

But it's a great challenge to our minds.

There are six more dominos when compared
to an ordinary mahjong game.

We have total 150 dominos.

For the wind domino, we
have an extra red dragon.

Do you have any instruction menu for me?

Forget it, just come and play.

You'll get the hang of
it after a few rounds.

What is the bet?

Anything would do, but no
money should be involved.

I have no money with me.

What? You're saying you are
staying here without paying.

At first, I don't want to stay.

But now, I am really in a bad mood, and
want to release my tension and relax.

All of you seem nice, so I want to stay.

Anyone have any job for me?

Of course, are you willing to work for me?

Okay, let's sign a contract for one year.
Ten years.

Endless contract.
Accepted. What if you break the contract?

I'll have bad luck for the rest of my life.
Okay, paper and pen please.

Here they are.

Endless contract?

Sign your name here.

Endless contract? Okay, let's play mahjong.

Come on.

Chestnuts with big cuttlefish.
Remove the shell from chestnuts.

The juice of the cuttlefish should
be used for making rice.

Clean the vegetables for frying.

Remove the roots and leaves, and fry it.

For the knuckle, clean it thoroughly.
Cut the nails too.

Are you crazy? Pigs don't have nails.

How about the fish?

Mince and juice it.

Can you show me how to juice a fish?

Steam it! I want everything
be ready in two hours.

Excuse me?

Can you lend me your phone?

Are you crazy? Don't touch.

Take it! Use the phone over there.

Sandy! Yes, I would like
to ask you something.

Chestnut with cuttlefish! The
big one, how to cook it?

Wash the chestnuts and
the cuttlefish first...

Hold on! Don't hang up.

Sandy, What's next?

Oil? Water? Wait...
Hot oil...

Sandy!
Elaine, you call back at last!

You can't live without money, right?

Dad!
Don't come back if you have guts!

Daddy... Daddy

What? You want to ruin my kitchen?

I don't know how to cook, so what?

I don't want you to be starved.

You can fire me if you like.

I'll just have bad lucky if I'm fired.

I don't rely on luck, I've always
relied on my hard work.

I heard you had a big
fight with your father.

Forget it..., it's okay.

I'll cook for you! Get out.

It's looks delicious!

He is...
He is fond of you!

Sure! I am so cute!

Eat good food!
Use paper plates!

It's so convenient!
No need to wash!

Who say no washing! You have to wash it too.

Wash paper dishes?

I don't want you to break the dishes!

Also, it's good for the environment.

What are you doing?

Want to check if you are wearing paper
underwear! Want me to wash them too?

You're crazy, who says I'm
wearing paper underwear.

Finish your food as soon as possible,
then wash the plates.

Their mood...
it's good!

Wash them all? Crazy!

Why should I wash? Why wash?

Pretty girl over there.

Wake up!

What are you doing here?

You're really exhausted?
You can sleep sitting up?

I've worked on cleaning the whole
model yesterday. I am really tired.

Can you tell the place is cleaner?

Sure! Have some soup.

That smells good.

Go ahead, drink it.

Why are you trembling?

Do you have any straws?
What for?

I can't hold a spoon. A straw will do.

It'll burn your tongue
drinking with a straw.

What can I do then?
I don't know.

What's that?
I am handicapped, feed me please.

You must be crazy?

I beg you!
No way!

Pity me please.
No! You're nuts!

You are not kind-hearted at all.
Yes I am...

Okay, I will feed you!

Is it hot?
Yes, it's really hot!

It's tasty! Did you make it?

You can cook!!
It's okay.

Not bad yourself, you can paint.
Did you take lessons?

Yes, I wanted to be a writer.

To write and to draw comics.

I have a story line already,
I'll show you later.

Sure!

What type of soup is this?
Fish soup.

Have some fish soup.

It's awful!

You'd put too much ginger
and orange peel in it.

You need to use raw salt
to make this soup tasty.

And, you can't stay too
near or too far from it.

Just two feet ais enough.

Throw it in.
Like this?

That's right.

In that case, the taste will be balanced.

And it'll be more tasty.

Come on, drink it.

It's tasty!

One more sip!

Can I drink soup everyday while I live here?

I don't think it stinks when I slept.

It's because your own body stinks.

Go that way! Not that many
people are over there!

No, come this side, this side is sunny!

Miss. Why did you let go of hands suddenly?
Are you OK?

I am afraid of dog, are you okay?

Don't move! It hurts!

Bring me the herbal oil from
the first drawer in my room.

Okay...

Do you know how to read?

The herbal oil is finished.

Just any oil would do.

Massage it, and the heat
will ease the swelling.

Do you know how? It really hurts!

Don't move! If the swelling stays,
you'll feel great pain!

Isn't that a call from the
princess? Aren't you happy?

Did you peep at my diary?

No!
No?

I just saw a gold watch and some rings.

How come! While I've been here,
I haven't seen Princess at all.

Did you have a fight with her?

She's out of town.

Why didn't you go with her?

Maybe,
she thinks it's more free to go alone.

Sure! When you go for a buffet, you
won't bring along your lunch box.

What do you mean?

Nothing! It meant nothing.
Itjust came out of my mouth, forget it.

How did you know her?

It's a long story!
I want to hear your story.

She isn't the woman I love most,

Is your mother the first woman you love?

I am an orphan.

I name myself after Washington
for I respect him most.

Why aren't you talking?

Do you pity me? Therefore, you
do not know how to react?

Ya, a little.

I don't think so.

My friends are with me,
together with the dogs and cats.

In winter, I can hug the dogs
and cats when I sleep.

In summer, we can swim together, it's great!

No wonder, you have such a close
relationship with them!

You set up a pet graveyard for them, right?

You know, the first dog I buried...
it's named was Shrimp.

It... Jojo

Shrimp, no!

It was alike Jojo.

Shrimp once scared a girl.

She kept on screaming! I felt so sorry.

What a pity that, I couldn't see her again.

I had no chance to say sorry to her.

Unwittingly, she became the
first woman in my life.

Later, I wanted to use my first $100,000
to build a pet graveyard.

When I arrived, I was robbed.

When I was most depressed,
she gave me a hand.

My dad has a motel in the KK Island.

It's been closed for some years,

why don't you manage it for my dad?

I know you can do it.

Okay.

So, that is...
She became your boss!

Sometimes, I feel like being
controlled by Princess.

Have you found that girl
you mentioned before?

No, what is gone is gone,
I would go there unwittingly.

No talk!

That stupid police thought I was a loafer.

I have nothing but a bit of self esteem.

You bought two tickets, so you want
me to watch a movie with you?

You mean these two tickets?
Martin bought them.

Three rules: No alcohol, no
gambling, and no cigarettes.

Five targets: Study hard.
Green card first, then gold credit card.

Dress properly.
Speak and write better English!

Do anything I want to do.
Boatman loves Tea-pot.

I want to improve myself,
I want to be in love!

What are you talking about?

I want to raise my ability
to meet all challenges.

I want to marry a nice man!

I want him to be touched, I want
him to fall deeply for me.

Please help me.
You're completely crazy.

Do you understand what I am talking about?

Let me hold you!
Don't lose your hand.

Come on!
You can't loose your hand!

Be slow! Look!

Are you okay?

No, the water is too salty!

How are you? Do you still have a fever?

Yes, a slight fever.

Drink it, it'll make you feel better.

What is it?
Cockroaches' soup.

No, not drinking.

I'm lying! It's fish soup.

Really?
Drink it while it's still hot.

It's delicious!

Look at yourself! You hurt your
arms and you've got a fever.

It's not worth it to improve
yourself like this.

No, I think it's worth! I have
made great improvement!

I know someone would fall for me soon.

Why? Because you know how to raise
dogs? You know how to swim?

It's no good to be that shallow!

I can't help it! I am only pretty
but I am really shallow!

Actually you are not bad.

You are straightforward,
independent and strong.

Though you are a bit sassy,
but men love sassy women.

Most important of all, you are tough.

You are really tough.

So, I am not bad.
Sure!

How about comparing with Princess?

That book is nice looking! What is it?

This is a diary written
by a girl named Thirteen.

I picked it up on the
beach when I was eight.

My life changed a lot after reading it.

I told you about my story
line and this painting.

They are inspired by this diary.

That's amazing. Can you show me?

Forget it, I don't like forcing anyone.

I'll leave the soup here, drink it yourself.
You'll be all right after a nap.

Take care! I haven't let
anyone read it before.

I am going to sleep now.

Please close the door.

I haven't let anyone read it before.

I know someone would fall for me soon.

You're not bad, you're straightforward,
independent and strong.

Though you are a bit sassy,
but men love sassy women.

Most important of all, you're tough.

How about comparing with Princess?

End of classes.

Where is my schoolbag?

That's not a dog.
What is it then?

That's not me.
Who is it?

It's not possible!
Look, you really like dogs.

No way.

You're not afraid of dogs!
Look, is that you?

That's not me, it's computer effect.

Take it out for a walk.
Me?

What are you afraid of?

No...
Go.

It doesn't want to go.

So romantic!

Didn't you faint?

I am fine.

You are fine so quickly.

I am going to take a shower.

Go fishing?

Yes. Do you want some fish soup?

Are you okay?

I am fine. Have you read the diary?

No, I have no time to read it.

Okay, I'll tell you the story.
Fine.

August 10, 1987,
Thirteen first left Hong Kong to New York,

she went there to meet
her boyfriend, Vincent.

Lightning in the east brings rain;
In the south, brings strong win.

In the west, fine weather; In
the north, it brings SW wind.

You learnt this being
a boatman for 10 years?

Of course! What else do you expect?

In the sea, a single man
only see seagulls...

I heard people saying that,

each seagull carries the
souls of dead sailors.

They go back to the places
they visited before,

they want to meet their old friends!

Can I drink fish soup everyday?

How would Boatman answer?

He will be so happy to say anything.

After Thirteen moved to the Long Island,
She missed Boatman everyday.

Her intuition told her that one
day, they'd see each other again.

But she couldn't imagine
that it'd be that sudden.

On the day they met,

Thirteen drank a bowl of fish soup...
in the Sampan restaurant.

Thirteen didn't return to
Long Island on that night.

She wrote her diary at the
pier opposite to Sampan.

Boatman sat by her side that
night and did not leave her.

Next to them, he was heating the fish soup.

At that moment, she felt that she was
the most luckiest woman on earth.

She decided never to leave Boatman.

One week later, they got married.

Yes. But their love faded afterwards.

Why did you say that?

I just guess... what did
Thirteen write after that?

Nothing.

I think she lost the diary
right after her marriage.

I guess they must be living
happily together.

It doesn't matter if they're together
or not, most important is to be happy.

Why are you so pessimistic?

I am not! The fact is, some things
in life you can't control.

Your wish will come true if you persist!

We're just talking, when it comes
to relationship, let fate decide.

This is a wrong attitude, the
path you are going is wrong.

Look at me.
Now, what?

You lack energy.
What are you talking about?

I can't find any energy in your
eyes, you're like a dead fish.

Damn it!
Now, you've got energy!

I have to go fishing now.

When is your birthday?

November 9, what is it?

My name is Sampan,
I am thirty four years old,

I am born in November ninth.
November...

Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday to Washington! Happy birthday to you!

Thank you.

You're welcome.
We...

Say thank you to your wife.
It's arranged by your wife.

What are you talking about?

She drown, I was just saving her.

Did you make the cake?

Yes, I spent the whole day!

Come on, make a wish and
then blow out the candles.

Thank you.

I am sorry.

Well... I was in the toilet.

Coward!

One second...

Good morning! You look so smart!

I've got a date.

About last night... I am sorry.

It doesn't matter, I've already
forgotten about it.

I forgot to give you this! Happy birthday.

Thank you! I've got to go now.

Why don't you take a look at it first?

Let me help you.

Do you like it?

Why did you give me a measuring tape?

Guess, how long will you live in your life?
Sixty something.

How old are you now?

Your life is only this long.

You must quickly grasp your opportunities,
must have self-confidence.

Who taught you that?

My granny taught me that.

The Boss is on leave today, so,
I am taking a day off too.

Tired! I am going back to my room.

I let you win! Joyce.

Hi! I am sorry to be late.

They insisted on finishing the 9th hole.
It doesn't matter! Come on.

Take a seat. Fine!

These are my friends, let
me introduce, this is...

Let me introduce myself.
My name is Shing, I am a lawyer.

Hello, lawyer...
Nice to meet you. How are you?

Hello, my name is Mick.
How are you?

Ken, I am an accountant.
Accountant? Nice to meet you.

Dino, I am an architect.
I am a professional too.

I am professional in burying dead bodies.
Also he runs a motel, too.

Yes, I run a motel...

Joyce, is he your boyfriend?

Yes, I am her boyfriend.

Not feeling well?

I have a sudden headache. It may be jet lag.

I'd better go home and rest.
I'll go with you!

Joyce, you just want to be with him?
Okay! We better leave them alone.

Come on! You guys are kidding!

Today is my birthday.
Really?

Two bottles of champagne please.

I'll bring you some water.

No! Stay here with me please.

What?

Stay with me please.

What's wrong?

Washington, I am sorry.
Why don't you go home?

We agreed that I'd stay
here with you tonight!

I want to be alone.

I want to think about our relationship.

We should give each other
some time for a while.

We've separated for a month already.

Didn't you feel anything?

We are from two different worlds.

Do you know...

when they asked whether
you're my boyfriend...

I don't want to answer.
I really didn't want them to know it.

Maybe, its because we haven't seen
each other for a long time.

Don't be like this, why don't we
go on holiday together, okay? I'll do whatever you want.

Don't push me, grow up, okay?

I still hope it will work between us...

I tried! I try to adjust around
you, not wear high heels.

And I never asked you to introduce
your friends to me.

Okay, I'll do anything you like.

No, it won't work.

I don't want your friends to think...

I don't want them to feel
that you and I don't match.

Sorry, give me some time to think about it.

Just do me a favor, okay?

I'll call you.

Okay...

Open the door!

Something's wrong.
Big trouble!

Washington...
and his princess...

They're in a cold war now.

Don't be that happy.
Cure him first.

Now, he is like a zombie.
I just want to cry!

Look at you! You are the most
ugly looking person around.

Why don't you say something
comfortable instead?

What made you feeling upset?

Being ugly? If yes, I would
have killed myself.

Your mom spoiled you!

Painting's not bad.

I came to say thank you! I am okay now.

Don't look down on yourself.

You finally see clearly.

Wait, it matches my watch.

Yes. It's nice looking.

It's for you.

It's ugly!

I love that horse ride.

I'll treat you to another
ride when I have money.

Want some?

Let me sing you a song.

It's so happy to be in the forest...

My dear friend, what are you thinking about?

Boatman is singing softly, my dear Trouble,

someone loves tea bag.

What's up? Leaving now?

Wait!

Boss, may I take a look at this watch?

Sure!

You like it at first sight,
it's destined to be yours.

My client put it here for sale.

Look, this is nicely made.
See the chain! It's beautiful!

There are only ten in the world!

The owner wanted to gave it to his lover,

but I think they've already broken up.

Since you like it, I'll give
you a special discount.

And I'll get rid of the
words for you, for free.

Thank you.

I am sorry, the owner doesn't
want to sell it! I am sorry.

Washington! Come out, your
boat is drifting away.

Do you like it?
Not bad.

Will you hang it out?
Later, maybe.

Why? Do it now if you want it.

You don't like it at all, right?

I don't mean it.

My room is really messy!

I will help you clean up your room.
The new one will replace the old one.

Let me do it myself?

Why did you yell at me?
Who do you think you are?

I am nobody! I won't care about you anymore.

Don't you ever come to bother me!

I have nothing...
except a bit self-esteem.

Thirteen.

Washington, she...

She called. No?
Who is it? Princess.

I don't want to play mahjong.

I want to swim.

It's good for the baby.
Let's go.

Washington, come with us.
Washington! Come on!

Help! Elaine is drowning, go save her.

Hurry up!

Don't use your tongue! No wet kisses!

No wet kisses!

How come it's you?

Your father is in trouble.

What is it?

He needs lots of money to save his business.

So, borrow money from the bank!
He has good relationship with the bank!

But the amount is too big, unless,
my family becomes his guarantor.

But my parents want you to marry me.

What?
They hope we will have a lot of babies.

What century are we in!

Come and join us!

It's funny! Come on!
Come over!

Are you still considering?

Shut up!

You have no other choice.
If you don't love me,

for the sake of your father, just
let me pay your living expenses.

Repeat what you've said.

Repeat which part?

I can'tjust leave.

But you should at least go
home to see your father.

I signed a contract with the boss!

It's not difficult to solve.

You don't understand...

Don't say anything wrong.

Mr. Washington, Elaine wants to end the
contract because of a personal reason.

Let her talk to me.

Why did you lose your temper?
I didn't!

If you don't want me to leave,
just say something.

Miss, I don't know what's happening?

I will solve my own problem.

I just want to know whether
you want me to stay or not.

Tell me.

Wait.

It's your call, she is crying badly!

Stop crying!

Stop crying. What is it?

Where are you going?

Why did you answer the phone?
It was none of your business.

Did you ask Washington to call...
he doesn't want me anymore.

You must be better than me.

He's been tortured by me for four years.

In these four years, he hasn't been happy.

Can he forget me?

If you stay with him, I don't mind.

I really don't mind.

You can make him very happy, right?

I...

You can't be like this.

You don't love him at all.

If you love him, you'll not hesitate.

Follow me.

If you don't believe in my
intuition, you can ask it.

Be brave!

Do you love Washington?

You don't love him, do you?

If you don't, please give him back to me.

I love Washington.

Joyce!

Washington.

Don't move, don't touch me.

Put a statue here.

I want to place some umbrellas
along the shore.

Okay, will do it accordingly.

And, right here...

You can't throw it away.

What is it? Let me take a look.

Do you like this painting?

If you don't like it, I'll keep it.

Where do you want to put it? In your heart?

Guess, how old will you live?
Sixty something.

How old are you now?
Twenty five.

Your life is only this long.

You must quickly grasp your opportunity,
you must have self confidence...

Washington, where are you going?

Stay where you are!

Where are you going to?

I am sorry.

Are you going to look for her?
Yes.

You can't leave, I am pregnant.

Impossible! We haven't
done it for half a year.

Yes, but the point isn't who the father is.

Once I know I am pregnant,

I just want you to be the baby's father.

It's so kind of me to marry you,
so, what else do you want?

Washington!

Washington, look!

Remember what you've done?

Washington, stay where you are!

You did so many things to hurt me,
but I'm still willing to marry you,

do you know why?

It's because I always think
you're a loyal man.

I know you'd be loyal to me forever.

You want loyalty? Get a dog!

Washington, stay! You can't leave me!

Yeah... Washington!

Elaine, what's wrong? The
guests have all arrived!

Get yourself ready, come on!

Wait!

Miss Elaine Fang, are you
willing to marry him?

Change your rings, hurry up!

Oh my son! Help! Call an ambulance!

Jojo, why are you here?

Where is Washington? Did he bring you here?

Where is he?

You are late! All the guests have gone.
They all left? That's right.

You'd say sorry!
Really

If you want to get married, marry me.
