Lord will come like a thief.

The heavens will
disappear with a roar.

The elements will be
destroyed by a fire.

And the earth and everything
done in it will be laid bare.

Always liked that girl.

I mean, you got

Are you working tonight?



No night shift, no.

Don't look at me like

Was it a good time.


Bless old Ruthie's heart
though, she don't hear a thing.

Hey, I'm good to her,
and I'm good to you.

I don't see why you don't
just take from that home though.

They got pills coming
out their eyeballs.

I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that.

"I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that."

You are such a choir boy.

Today's your lucky day though,

we're lousy with oxy this month.

You sure Ruthie
don't need these?

Yes I'm sure, Ruthie,
don't need those.

We got scripts from
four different docs.

We're good.

Thank you very much.

Well, looky, looky.

Come on, get you some.


You're good?

No.

I'm okay.


I never started.

It was a good fucking party.


Yeah, I throw good fucking
parties, what can I say?


Hey.

Good to see.

You too.

We're good?

Yeah, I'm good, you good?

Yeah, I am now.

All right, take care.

Okay.

Evening, doc.

Everett.

[rock music]

[engine rumbles]

Clyde always was a character.

You give him my best

and y'all just let me
know what you decide.

We will.
Evening, ladies.

Howdy.

[women chattering]

Did I miss something?

No, the girls just
came by for a visit.

Check on daddy.

Yeah, he's worse, you know.

What did he want?

Now Cole, don't
get upset, but-

We need to make sure

that mama and daddy
are provided for.

aren't gonna last forever.

And there ain't no retirement
plans for country preachers.

I take good care of them.

He does, he takes
very good care of us.

But it ain't his land, mama.

It's ours.

Ours and his mama.

Well, she ain't here, is she?

gentle with him?

[Woman #2] Sorry, but
someones gotta say something.

Angels.

Angels and vultures.

Can't rest.

Can't rest with them
birds squawking around.

Peck at you, peck, peck, peck.

Peck till there's nothing left.

[Clyde groans]

And I hear you thinking,

now that the kingdom of
heaven is so close[coughing].

Slow down.
[Clyde coughing]

Slow down, slow down, slow down.

Slow down.

That's right.

Oh Lord.
That's right.


For the Lord himself
will come down from heaven

with a loud command,

with the voice of the archangel

and with the
trumpet call of God,

and the dead in Christ
will rise first.


[dramatic guitar music]

I appreciate it, Kelly.

[dramatic guitar music]

Last time I saw you I
get my hands on you.

What's good, man?

You good?

Yeah, I'm doing all
right man, I'm pretty good.

I'll talk to you
later, all right?

Yeah okay.

Good to see you.

Yeah, good to see you.

Cole Freeman, that you?

Almost didn't recognize
you in the getup.

Wow.

It's a good disguise I guess.

You in need of hiding?

Hey, Kathy.

Hey Cole.

It's good to see you.


You a doctor or something?

I'm just like an
aide over at Beverly.

No shit?

I always knew you were
destined for greatness.

Beats this getup, right?


Been back a couple weeks,

lost my job over there
in Campbell County.

Times are tough you know.

Excuse me, beauty, can
we have some menus?

away, Mr. Rose.

it is nice being home.

We're living with my folks.

Okay.

Nothing like sneaking
carnal relations

to bring you back to your
high school days, right?

Speaking of, I heard you're
seeing Charlotte Carson.

I am.

You know she works for me now.

She was a wild little thing
when we were together.

Yeah, well that
was a long time ago.

She's been with chicks, bro.

Good seeing you, man.

I gotta get back to work.

Hey, hold up, partner.

Might you be holding anything?

What?

Charlotte said you
could maybe hook me-

I gotta go.

Get the fuck outside.

Oh, little Jodie Hampton.

Oooh.

You got something on
the side with her?

Times have changed, brother.

He don't need to know
where we're staying.

need to lose your job.

You can't follow the rules,
you find somebody else, okay?

I just need something small.

This isn't how it works.

Small's all I need.

Don't make me go to Everett.

[dramatic music]

Get the fuck outta here.

Fuck.

[dramatic music]

You good?

Here we go.

[dramatic music]

How's your day today?

Your day good?

Yeah?

[dramatic music]

There you go.

How you doing today?

I'm good.



There you go.

Thank you.

Yeah.

[dramatic music]

[engine stalls]

Come on.

[engine stalls]

Fuck.

Shut up.

[both chuckling]

What a piece of shit.

You should buy the new Tahoe.

Oh yeah, you think I'm rich?

You could you
use that same money

and finally get
out of this place?

Yeah?

I got friends in New
York and Cleveland.

I could set us up.

Ah, you're high.

Nope, but on my way, baby.

Appreciate the pick me up.

I wish you'd stick to booze.

We all want something.

My new boss and I were talking.

Yeah, I know.

I told you not to talk about
my business with people.

Terry Rose ain't people.

Come on, Cole.

All girls pick the wrong
guys when they're young.

The smart ones right their ways.

I thought you'd be tickled
your old buddy's back.

Either way, Terry Rose
is the only person

thinking big around here.

You should hear him out.

Yeah, I got enough problems.

[engine rumbles]

Yes.

[light rock music]
[people chattering]

Here.

[light rock music]
[people chattering]


Hey.

Late last week.

Well, I kicked him out.

Oh shit, I'm sorry, I didn't-

Oh it's all right... I think

Seeing as I ran out of his sock
drawer money, here I am.

Shit.

Friend of a friend said
they saw him in St. Louis.

I hope he drowns
in the Mississippi.

Let me get you beer.

Hey, good to see
you here, Lacey.

You improve the place.

She was prettier
in high school.

Give me a dance and I'll
forgive you for making eyes.

Hey, you know I don't dance.

Come on baby,
it's Saturday night.

You know I don't dance.

[slow country music]

â™ª You'll never hear
me talk about â™ª

â™ª One day getting out â™ª

â™ª Why put a new address â™ª

â™ª On the same old loneliness â™ª

â™ª Everybody knows
where that is â™ª

â™ª We built that house of his â™ª

â™ª And when he's not home â™ª

â™ª Someone else we
know always is â™ª

â™ª If heavens really
coming back â™ª

â™ª I hope it has a heart attack â™ª

â™ª When they see how dangerous
it is for guys like that â™ª

Hey, buddy.

Hey.

It's great to
see nothing changes

but the seasons around here.

Where's Kathy?
Home.

Smart woman.

Campbell's party the other night.

Nah, I missed it.

it was a good time.

He did some time, right?

Yeah, he's clean now.

[Terry chuckles]

That's not what I hear.

You two working together.


Whatever you're
into, I'm cool, man.

I think you got some
wrong information.

Maybe I did, maybe I did.

Got some stuff flies faster
than skeeters around here.

[Terry chuckles]

[slow music]

I got an early shift tomorrow.

One drink?

It's been a long time.

Yeah, it has.

I've missed you.

Let's maybe tie one
on later this week.

I'll try.

Make it happen, Kemosabe.

â™ª All it's been about â™ª

â™ª Trying, trying, trying â™ª

â™ª Trying, trying, try
to be simple again â™ª

Hey, Cole!
Hey.

Lord have mercy, what has
he brought us this time?

I got you a crossword.

Oh, thank you.

I'll bring these inside.

Go on inside, son.
Okay.


You make this
with the tap water?

You can't, you can't drink this.

How many times do
I gotta tell y'all.

Hey, why don't y'all
let me fix that floor?

House won't be
standing much longer.

Yeah, us neither.

By the way, I got
something for ya.

Yes, sir.

I don't know why they
still prescribe them,

back ain't bothered me for ages.

Thank you.

See y'all later.

[Automated Voice] You

cellphone when you get this.

[Automated Voice]
End of message.

[dramatic music]

[water splashing]
[dramatic music]

[dramatic music]

Ruby.

Ruby.

[all chattering]

He said this one a lot.

Proverbs 23:13.

Do not withhold
discipline from a child.

If you punish them with a rod-

Or switch-

Or a hand.

He was a good man.

He was a good man.

Take care of yourself, I'll
come back and check on you.

All right, thank you.
Hey.

You all right?

I just needed a
little moment of quiet.

[engine rumbles]
[upbeat music]

Oh my God.

Hey.

I thought I would
make it in time.

Hey there.
Oh, Rebecca.


Come here, mama.

Oh Ruby, I can't
believe you're here.

Hey you.

[light violin music]

Hey.


Hi.

I'm so sorry. I couldn't
make the service.

Randy and I had-

Oh no, hey, that's okay.

Okay.

Let me know if you need
anything, all right?

All right, yeah, thanks.

Okay.

Ellen, I appreciate that.

Okay.

[light violin music]

I'm real sorry.

There it is.

let me love on you a little.

Everything's gonna be all right.

You got a lot on
your mind, I know.

It true your mamas back?

Where's she been, what she want?

I don't know.

That's all you got to
say after all this time?

You ain't even the least bit-

What's this got
to do with you?

Wow.

Well, fuck it.

[engine rumbles]

Jodie.
Trying to get high.

Just something.

[car door bangs]



You don't look it,
don't mind me saying.

I'm fine.

Y'all gonna settle
now he's gone?

No, we're not going anywhere.

Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

I mean, it's nice to see
somebody's not giving in.

Hey, buddy.

Oh, look who it is, our
most devoted new customer.

Returning customer, darling.

Three shots of the wildest
turkey you got back there,

third one's for you.

Real sorry to hear
about Clyde, man.

Thanks.

At least you know
what's happening,

finally up close
with the big guy.

You got a point.

Well, I can't do too much,

but I can get you
drunker than hell.

Here you go.

I might as well
drink the third one.

How was I supposed to know

you couldn't piss by
a playground, man?

[both chuckling]

You haven't changed at all.
Everybody doing all right?

doing all right.

Oh, man.

Crazy, crazy is those fuckers
over there in Campbell, man.

They're fucking crazy,

I knew a guy who cooked
meth in his trailer,

damn near blew the
roof right off, man.

You ever try it?

No.

It's pretty wild, man.

Wouldn't be your
kind of buzz though.


Really, I'm pretty sure.

Your friend, your friend Reese,

I mean I hear that fairy

can't put it up his nose
fast enough, crystal, ox.

I guess some guys just
like to swing both ways.

asking around then?

Well, I'm working with some
boys up the way, you know.

Gonna start our own operation.

And the way I see it a lot
of folks around are going

to be graduating from
the service you provide.

Well, my what?

go in with me?

You already know all
the best customers.

You don't wanna
mess with junk, man.

There's a fella in town.

Everett, Everett
won't know about it.


Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm gonna diversify.

Chrissy hasn't gone
anywhere, it's just on cops,

the back burner so to speak.

That's funny.

Stupid.

Yeah, I need a place to cook,

I was thinking about
that old church of yours.

It's nothing but
crumbling walls now.

park something there.

Not on our land, Terry,
that's not gonna happen.

All right.

Sole proprietor on
this one, I got it.

I'd be careful about who
you're telling your ideas to.

This town is small, it
already has its ways.

Just in a pretty
deep hole is all.

It's time to start
digging out, you know?

Yeah.

You remember when
we cut our hands?

Like a couple buffalo
jockies, you remember that?

Yes, stupid kids.

runs thick, don't it?

That it does.

[dramatic music]

How dear to my heart are
the scenes of my childhood,

when fond recollections
presents them to view.

The orchard, the meadow,
the deep tangled wildwood,

and ev'ry loved spot
which my infancy knew.

The wide spreading pond, and
the mill that stood by it.

The bridge and the rock
where the cataract fell.

It's real nice
you read to her.

I am real nice.

Contrary to what
you may have heard.

Look, buddy, I got
nothing for you.


Fuck you.

Who's been advising
you since day one

of this little venture yours?

Huh?

What do I get?

Terry fucking Rose up
my ass day and night

saying you told him I can
help him cook up some crack.

I didn't.


for bringing that kind
shit back in my life.

I never said that, Reese.

This here's Ruthie's home.

I ain't gonna mess
with her estate.

That little prick's so hard up,

he can shake and bake
like everybody else,

don't need to fucking trailer.

I'm sorry he's hassling you.

Yeah, me too.

All this H talk, Cole, that
boy better shut his mouth.

Can you front me some pills?

Ruthie's Medicaid's all
fucked up right now.


All right.

You know I'm good for it.


I'll see you.

[sirens blaring]

My timing's
always been perfect.

Been happening all day.

No wonder daddy
thought the end was nigh.

Who can live like this?

You one to judge?

Is it so bad that
I'm still here?

Can I come in?

I'm not stopping you.

What you reading?

You're just like him.

Clean and sparse, holy.

I'll return to the house I left,

swept clean, and in right order.

Matthew 12:44

back, like a rash.

Yeah.

wearing my shirt.

You all done much traveling?

I've been all over.

I haven't been west of
the Mississippi though.

It's too far from home.

Yeah.

You wouldn't understand, baby.

[dramatic piano music]

No, I wouldn't.


That's real nice.

[dramatic piano music]

[engine rumbles]
[dramatic music]

Got a friend right
over there in Beverly

who can hook us up with cold
meds, and a place to cook.

This just to get some
cash flow coming in.

I got bigger buys on route.

This town ain't gonna be no
one horse operation for long.

[dramatic music]
[engine rumbles]

Hey, hey, all right
Davis, hey, Davis, Davis,

hey, hey, Davis, Davis.

Look at me, Ellen is
on your side, okay?

Like me, I'm on your
side okay, you trust me.

Okay.

You're okay, all right?

Okay.

You're okay.

Okay.

You're okay, you're okay.

younger friends.

Yeah, ya do.

Over my dead body.
Atta boy.

[pool balls clattering]

Hey.
Hey yourself.

Y'all come here together?

Where else you go in this
town with time on your hands?

What happened to your eye?

You're up.

Okay.


â™ª You were born to lose,

Don't run off.

Hey, you hungry?
Hey, Cole.

Hey there, Cole.

I'm all right, you all right?

Yeah I'm all right.

Okay.

How are you doing?

I'm all right now.

[both chattering]

â™ª You were a racer
in a broke down van â™ª


I said get up.

You'll be all right,
I'll get ya out tomorrow.

â™ª You were a savior
in a shattered land â™ª

No, no, I wouldn't
do that to you, man.

Rumors Everett, rumors.

Small town lies
to pass the time.

â™ª You were awestruck â™ª

I wouldn't do that to you, man.

I wouldn't do that to you, man.

Okay.

There's no way I'd
step on your toes.

No way.

Bye, Everett.

ain't for a long time?

Cheers Ruthie up.

No harm in a little twinkle
twinkle every now and then.

[Reese chuckles]


Your friend Terry Rose is
going to be the end of me.

Old friend.

Yeah, well, wish
I had known that.


I gave him some of these
allergy scripts to cook up.

[Reese sniffs]

do that, Reese?

Charlotte said it was cool.

Whatever, man, I
don't fucking know.

Are they cooking in here?

Fuck no.

Anyway, I'm done with that boy.

Fini, caput.


Everett finds out that you're
involved even a little bit.

Oh please.

Fuck, man.

How much longer you
think we got this in us?


Ruthie be gone by Christmas?

I gotta get the fuck outta here.

I get caught with
anything, and I'm done.

Brother, they're going to
send my ass right on back.

[Reese sighs]

I'm talking someplace warm.

Far away.

Water you can swim
outside in warm.

Swim in January
warm, you feel me?


I'll see old Ruthie
through the gates of heaven,

pay off a little bit
of debt, and then warm.

Warm, warm, warm, SPF
warm, Florida style.

You watch me.

quite yet, but I'm almost done.

I don't want you to
see this till tonight.



You ready?
Yeah.

I don't know why your
granddaddy made such fuss

about salad breaking
someones birthday.

Maybe he had his reasons.


He also didn't think I
should get my hair cut.

Hey, you gotta make Ruby
clean up after herself.

Well I get onto her about
it, but I really don't mind.

I'm glad she's here.


[man shouting]

You rehearsed his
sermons in here, Grandma.

Ruby thinks I should travel.

She says there's a
whole lot more to see

in this world than Dove Creek.

Oh yeah?

She'd know.

You know sometimes
you just have to make

the best out of a bad situation.

Go see her at work.

What, she got a job?

Well if you came
around here more often,

you'd know that, wouldn't you?

Go see her.


What do you think
of this getup?

Mine any better?

Yes, yes it is.

Mom ask you to come by?

Yeah.

Well, you came anyway.

You got plans for tonight,
big birthday bash at the bar?

No, not really.

I'm-I'm trying to
stay out of trouble.

Yeah, okay.

You busy tomorrow morning?

I need to pick up a
few things at the BNP

and it'd be nice to
have a companion.

I'll take you.

Thank you.

Found you some
more nursing books.

Got them at a store
in Charleston.


That's me.

Happy birthday.

Thanks.

[phone buzzing]

[engine rumbles]

Never thought I'd come up
here again without Danny.

It's been destroyed.

They're supposed to clean up
after their mess, rebuild.

That's the least of
their concerns right now.

Did you hear Caldwell
went under last week.

Well, can only chip away
at something for so long.

Going to be nothing
left for my girl.

I'm sorry.

No, that's all right.

Hey, here.


Take this.

What's that?

It'll make you feel better.

[Cole yells]

You just do that.

[Lacey laughing]

[Lacey yells]

That was okay.

[both laughing]

Give me another one.


This is a good
one, I can feel it.


[Cole grunting]

That's pretty good,
wanna see what I got?


[Lacey grunting]

That was good.

[both yelling]
[dramatic music]

Fuck!

[Lacy laughing]


I'm keeping this one.

That's a nice one.

[dramatic music]

[people chattering]

Hey.

Smoke break?

I can't just now.

I'm not asking.

This is hard.

What?

I know what you do, Cole.

What I do?

Don't lie to me.

How?

How do you think?

You got a good man.

Yeah.

You steal from here?

No, no, no.

I'm careful

You know an investigation
here would be a disaster.

Prescriptions held
up, insurance holds.

I mean, you got to think
about these folks in here.

Yeah, I do think about them.

Yeah, but you can't
keep working here.

You can't keep putting
these people at risk.

Is that so?

I'm trying to be your friend
here and I don't have to be.

Fuck this.

Who do you think you are?

We care for these people,

and then you go out

and you make folks more
sick than they already are?

Like, fuck this, fuck you.

Fuck you, Cole.

[dramatic music]

[engine rumbles]

[phone beeping]

Should've known by the smell.

Mouth on you.

No sugar, no, no, no.

That's just your stank pussy.

[Reese snorts]

[light blues music]

How many times you
need to hear it, man?

I ain't seen Terry in weeks.

Back in Campbell far as I know.

Hey, Reese.

Nah, I got this.

This between me and him.

Now, might there be something
else you're interested in?

Right about here?

Come on, cowboy.

Yeah.

[glass shatters]


[gun fires]

Oh, my, my.

How quickly this is turning
into my kind of party.

Get him up.

So you want it on this, doc?

I'm just trying to

Your friends, quite

How much you offering?

I got close to

[Reese coughs]

[Reese crying out]
[man yelling]

Take it.

Yeah, yeah.

It's only about 1100 boss.

It'll do.

[Reese gasping]

Well, this has been

an absolutely delightful
evening, ladies.

Oh yeah, go on and get.

Unless of course you want

to stick something
else in my mouth.

[Reese cries out]

I hear Terry Rose has been

visiting a few of your patients.

Such decent folks.

Leave them out of it.

I'd like to, doc.

I've always appreciated
our little arrangement,

you teeing folks up and all.

We aren't the same.

Go find your pal.

Go find Terry Rose and
that little whore of his,

we need to have a little
conversation about geography.

They're in some
dangerous territory.

Mine!

In the meantime,

[gun thudding]
[Reese grunting]

we're gonna have ourselves
a little lesson in manners.

Go!

[engine rumbles]

Courtney, would you
get in the car please?

Can I just talk to you for-

No, wait just a minute.

to you for a minute.

No, I can't.

Look, I got no room for this.

[car door bangs]

[all chattering]

Hey baby.
Hey Lottie.

Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

Get the fuck out of here.

I just want you

Just hear me out.

I'll go to the cops.

[Terry laughs]

I doubt that.

I'll go to Everett.

[Terry sighing]

You stay away from my people.

It's a little late
for that now, ain't it?

Meet me at the quarry
tomorrow night.

We'll sort this out
once and for all.

I mean I'd hate
to have to go see

your grandma and Ruby too.

I hope you're thirsty out there.

[engine rumbles]

[door clicking]

Is Ruby here?

I need you to talk to y'all.

Oh, son, you've got someone
waiting for you out back.

She's been out there for hours.

Don't you ever come by my
grandmother's house again.

You hear me?

He's gonna kill me, kill

What'd you do?

[dramatic music]

I've been working with Terry.

He used my trailer to cook.

Fuck.

Charlotte.

[dramatic music]

It was supposed to
be a one time thing.

Then we'd be out of here.

You're all I got, Cole.


Man, fuck me.

[Reese laughs]

Yeah.

Home sweet home.

You don't believe me?

I never heard you

Who?

Oh, the big guy?

Yeah well, we've been
recently reacquainted.

We got lots to be

Things could have

Yeah.

You gotta find

Can't stand to look at

I'm running out of

I got a guy coming
to town tomorrow night

with a serious package at H.

It's way better than that
Mexican horse floating around.

I don't pay, I'm a dead man.

I need some money, now.

I got to tell you no?

[Terry] Well, I'll-
No.

get ya a cut once I sell it.

Do you understand what
Everett is capable of?

He's got enough
to worry about.

If little Jodie
Hampton ever wakes up,

she can tell the whole world
who sold her that dirty tar.

[Terry laughs]

Look at you.

[dramatic music]

Look at you.

Always the same furrowed brow,
and you're fit to be tied.

[dramatic music]

We might as well be 17 again.

Man, why should
I trust you now?

We were brothers.

[Cole laughs]

[Terry laughs]

We ain't kin.

[dramatic music]

Don't seem like so
long ago, does it?

[dramatic music]

[Cole laughing]

It does to me.

I wish someone told me then,

given me some goddamn warning.

[Terry cries]

Watch out Terry, you
little piece of shit.

[dramatic music]
[Terry crying]


[Terry cries]

You're the only chance I got.

Do this for me man,
please, please.

[dramatic music]
[Terry crying]

Hey.

Hey, hey.

[Terry crying]

I'm a fucking failure, man.

[Cole chuckles]

[Terry crying]
[dramatic music]

How much you talking?

Five, five grand.

Where?
Dago.

Nine o'clock, tomorrow night.

How's it supposed to go?

[dramatic music]

I met this, there's
this boy, Reggie.

[both chuckling]
[dramatic music]

You motherfucker.

[dramatic music]

It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

No, it wasn't.

You'll be okay.

Okay.

[dramatic music]

Game's over.

[country music]
[people chattering]

Hey fuck, man.

All right, here's Reggie.

Well hey man, great

What brings-
Shut your mouth.

I don't know what the
fuck's going on man.

Hey, just be cool.

We're gonna handle

Who the fuck is this?

Language, son.

Let's sit down, boys.

I ain't asking.


Tell Everett what
you've been doing.

I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

I'm not messing
around with you.

[Terry sighs]

I cooked, I sold, a little.

Mostly I just scored
on my own stash.


you were all cock and no balls.

I got your money.

And it's going to your boy
here on behalf of Everett.

He's gonna make the purchase.

And you're gonna
leave town tonight.

You understand me?

Finally, so which on of you

is stepping out to
the car with me?


go make a deal, kid.

Hold up a goddamn minute,

I can't just pick up
and fucking leave.

Terry, it's done.

Doc here just
purchased your freedom.

Can't promise what'll happen
is I leave here empty handed.

Well I think a
small finder's fee

should at least be applied.

Finder's fee?

You boys really know how to
complicate the simplest things.

Come on, kid.

Fucking Cole, I
ain't town two months,

I damn near put on
Everett here, I did.

Is that what you think.

It's what I fucking know.

You've just been a pest.

Like crabs on a
dick, nothing more.

Terry, sit the fuck down.

Listen ladies, y'all
can kiss and make up

after I'm gone, but let's
do this shit already.

Watch your mouth, stranger.

Get the fuck out of my face.

You just lost all
value to me, punk!

Everett, he's a kid,
he's a kid, Everett.

hands up and turn around!

This is on you!

No, no, no!

[gun fires]


Drop to your knees,
lay flat, lay flat.

[dramatic music]
[all shouting]

Shit, is that one dead?

local, Gary, or Jerry something.


[dramatic music]
[people chattering]

We got him, boys.

[dramatic music]
[people chattering]


You all right?

Nobody was
supposed to get hurt.

We did our best, Cole.

[dramatic music]

I didn't know what you liked

so I just made what I know how.

I'll get you a
little more bacon.

All right.

You curious about your daddy?

Mama ever tell you anything?

Did you know him?

Of course I knew him.

Last I heard he was in South
Carolina, John Milligan.

All right.
Okay.

I'm sorry, I'm just
not that hungry is all.

Nah, no, it tastes like shit.

[both chuckling]

to grandma for a bit.

Yeah.

Oh, just a minute though.

For kindling, or
you know, whatever.

Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.

Please write.

I will.
More than I did, okay?

Where should I send them?

Right here.

Here's fine.

He asked for you, you know,
you were the one he wanted.

Maybe he was asking forgiveness.

â™ª Island light upon our skin â™ª

â™ª Your form, it lingers â™ª

â™ª Trace just where you've been â™ª

â™ª Songs we sang,
I'll sing again â™ª

â™ª When it breaks
down, babe let's try â™ª

â™ª To see the beauty
in all the fading â™ª

â™ª I saw the river
thick with mud â™ª

â™ª Break thorough
the banks and run â™ª

â™ª And I'll confess I liked it â™ª

â™ª I cheer the flood â™ª

â™ª When the water hit
the walls and won â™ª

â™ª When it breaks
down, babe let's try â™ª

â™ª To see the beauty
in all the fading â™ª

[woman vocalizing]

â™ª The roads are endless,
they seem to grow â™ª

â™ª Vines, they wind
around a world â™ª

â™ª And though I hate it â™ª

â™ª To leave my home â™ª

â™ª I love that car
when I need to go â™ª

â™ª When it breaks down â™ª

â™ª Today let's try to see the
beauty in all the fading â™ª


â™ª And old Kentucky
stays in my mind â™ª

â™ª It's sweet to be
five years behind â™ª

â™ª That's where I'll be,
when the seas rise â™ª

â™ª Holding my dear friends
and drinking wine â™ª

â™ª When it breaks
down, babe let's try â™ª

â™ª To see the beauty
in all the fading â™ª

â™ª When it breaks down,
and the stakes get high â™ª

â™ª To see the beauty
in all the fading â™ª


[light banjo music]

â™ª There's a kind of
man, says he knows â™ª

â™ª What he'll never understand â™ª

â™ª And his so called
love drinks too deeply â™ª

â™ª With no thought of the land â™ª

â™ª But you stand inside
a golden light â™ª

â™ª Cast by your own hand â™ª

â™ª Hope is a choice â™ª

â™ª Love has a voice, it's not
the leaves or the branches â™ª

â™ª But the whisper in between â™ª

â™ª I have traveled as far north â™ª

â™ª As I could care to go â™ª

â™ª And I've crawled the
tracks over rivers â™ª

â™ª Made of miles
of melting snow â™ª

â™ª And when we climb
below the span â™ª

â™ª I found your words below â™ª

â™ª Hope is a choice â™ª

â™ª Love has a voice â™ª

â™ª It's not the
ice or the water â™ª

â™ª But the whisper in between â™ª

â™ª In due time, you
will raise your roof â™ª

â™ª Your own hands, your
heart will mourn â™ª

â™ª And the last
lovers promised you â™ª

â™ª Are mere shadows of the
warm you're looking for â™ª

â™ª Da da da da da da
da da da da da da da â™ª

â™ª Hope is a choice â™ª

â™ª Love has a voice â™ª

â™ª It's not the leaves
or the branches â™ª

â™ª But the whisper in between â™ª
