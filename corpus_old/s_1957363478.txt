[Crow cawing]

[Soldier] Halt.

Now break off.

[Foreboding music]
[Crickets chirping]

[Mother] Darling, you
should not be so hard

on your sister.

[Older sister]
She's not my sister.

Well, that is untrue.

You have a sister, a
brother and a father.

You have everything.

That thing is not my father.

Hush!

And you, you have duties.

You are neglecting them.

You will change

or I will cut off the
limb that makes you sin.

[Fire crackling]

[Gentle music]

The yank, Yankees were driven

from cor, corinth by va, val-

Valiant.

While those who are doubtful

are with scarcely an exception,

men who are doubtful the
relations of social life,

who are dissolute or dishonest

or false in their
private character or.

[Gentle music]

[Billiard balls clacking]

You cheat.

With you, I don't have to.

[Upbeat music]

Now, chain of command.

General, colonel,
major, captain-

I know the chain of command.

The exam hardly matters, anyway,

it's the vote that counts.

Easy, nurse, easy.

He'll be back.

After the vote you'll be
calling me, captain Healy.

Don't you forget it.

I'll be calling you mudsill.

[Upbeat music]

[Grass rustling]

Is this what you're meant
to be doing right now?

How long have you
spent with this?

How long have you been idle

while your sister sweats?

She told me to
learn these words-

and what am I telling you now?

Ever since you've got those
specs, you've been useless.

We need a man on this farm,

not a child, wearing these.

Please.

You were more useful when
you were slow and dumb.

What should we do
about that now?

You read that book didn't you?

If your right arm
causes you to sin,

cut it off.

If your right eye
causes you to sin,

put it out and you
will stop sinning.

Please.

[Younger sister yells]

[Girls gasping]

[Dramatic music]

[Older sister] You!

[Frantic music]

[Both gasping]

[Muffled talking]

[Boom vibrates]

[Heartbeat thudding]

[Boom vibrates]

[Muffled talking]
[Heartbeat thudding]

[Bell ringing]

[Men laughing]

Boys, boys, what
are you doing here?

Where's our young captain?

Gotta run him in.

The exam, boys, exam.

Exam, he could fold it up
and put it under his hat.

In, all of you.

[Billiard balls clacking]
[Men laughing]

[Man] I hope you boys

don't shoot like this
on the battlefield.

[Soldier] Don't you
single me out, cross eyes.

Miss, you sure
he's not back yet?

[Soldier] I'm getting tired
of this mob of blind men.

You couldn't hit water
if you fell off a boat.

[Soldier] Woohoo.

[Soldier]
Gentlemen, button it.

Yeah!
Let her go.

Yeah.
Nice, very nice.

[Man] Very nice.

[Soldier] Oh, excellent.

[Man] Good going.

[Men laughing]

Very nice shot.

Yeah, yeah.
Good shot.

Good shot.

Yeah.
Um-hm.

[Men chuckling]
[Men murmuring]

[Nurse] Miss, miss.

[Alan's sister] Listen to her.

Begging your pardon, boys.

I'll be back in a minute.

[Man] How about leaving
some for the rest of US?

What the devil are you doing?

[Scoffs] They just needed
a halfway decent shot.

They're voting on your
brother's officership

here in a few hours.

You are embarrassing them.

We have known these
boys for years, years.

Oh, run along and
get a drink of water.

You'll feel much better.

[Father] Voted down!

[Alan] That's what
happened, father.

[Father] How in heaven's name

could you have been voted down?

Honestly, I don't know.

We were all chums this morning

and then now they don't
want anything to do with me.

[Father] This is
a devil of a fix.

I refuse to have a son
at home, out of uniform.

You won't.

I walked down the
street and enlisted.

[Father] Enlisted?

As a private?

I ship out tomorrow.

[Father] You will withdraw it.

[Alan] I can't withdraw it.

[Father] This has
beneath your station

and beneath your prospects.

You have responsibilities
to your family

and your class.

[Alan]
Responsibilities to what?

Sit out the war
on a feather bed?

[Foreboding music]

[Footsteps clomping]

You, up.

Bring him back!

[Upbeat banjo music]
[Men chattering]

[Soldier] Attention.

[Soldiers chanting]

[Soldiers yelling orders]

Go on, girl.

[Clock ticking]

The next meeting is on Monday.

My brother ships out tomorrow.

I had heard.

I'm going with him.

When I was nine you told me

you knew when I was fooling.

Am I fooling now?

You tell me.

You can tell me
what I'm going into

or I can find out on my own.

I am not afraid.

The nearest term for what
you are now is vivandiere.

This is not like
in the operettas.

There are no sanitary
commissions where you're going.

There are no respectable ladies.

You march as the men do.

You eat as they do.

You sleep as they do.

You are a camp follower.

[Clock ticking]

[Gentle music]

You're not an official
part of the army.

You receive neither rank nor pay

nor even the clothes
on your back.

Anything you have, you
have by scrounging, begging

or bringing it with you.

[Somber music]

[She sighs]

[Father wheezing]

You are at the mercy
of the officers.

They can expel you from camp
at any time far from home.

Your only hope is to
make yourself necessary.

[Soldiers chattering]

Come with me.

[Man coughing]
[Soldier groaning]

[Wounded soldier] Please,
please, god, please.

[Soldier coughing]

[Flies buzzing]

[Soldiers chattering]

[He sighs]

You have a bedroll?

One'll open up soon.

No, it will not, steward.

I will not have
women in this camp.

I will not have children here.

Now, you instruct her to leave

or the provost marshal
will perform that duty.

You look a little
peckish, colonel.

You need another
day in the hospital.

I am needed till
midday at the latest.

And make it two to be safe.

I will walk out of here

if I have to write
Jeff Davis himself.

You care to make it three?

Ah, devil take you, steward.

[Colonel groans]

You look better
already, colonel.

[Melancholy music]

[Soldier winces]

[Somber music]

[Gentle music]

[Mrs. Fultz] You will
face danger without defense.

You are there as an angel
of mercy, never vengeance.

You move above the fray.

So understand this.

[Steamboat whistle blowing]
[Soldiers chattering]

You are never, ever
to join the fight.

â™ª We are a band of brothers
and native to the soil â™ª

â™ª fighting for the property
we gained by honest toil â™ª

â™ª hurrah, for the Bonnie blue
flag that bears a single star â™ª

[Crowd cheering]

â™ª Hurrah, for the
Bonnie blue flag â™ª

[Train wheels clacking]

[Man] Hey.

[Solders chattering]

[People yelling]
[Guns firing]

[Artillery shell explodes]

[Muffled heartbeat pounding]

[Vivandiere pants]

[Men yelling]
[Guns firing]

[Vivandiere hyperventilates]

[Solider] Sir, if
they reload that Cannon.

I understand.

Take 'em.

[Guns firing]

[Somber music]

[Heartbeat pounding]

[Vivandiere gasps]

[Melancholy music]

[Water sloshing]

[Vivandiere cries]

[Vivandiere sniffles]

[Gun firing]

[Foreboding music]

[Soldier moaning]

[Gun firing]

[Gunner] What you
got for me yankee?

[Scavenger] Come
on, hold still.

Come on, I'll make
you hold still.

[Alan's sister] Stop
it, stop it right now.

[Gunner] Who's that?

You ghouls, you grave robbers.

I'm warning you.

There's a whole unit of
federals over that hill.

What do you think they'll
do when they see this?

Get back to your own lines.

Get back!

Get back!

[Body thuds]

[Men laugh]

[Anxious music]

[Twig snaps]

[Vivandiere gasps]

[Tense music]

Shh.

[Men chuckling]
[Men clapping]

[Men yelling]

[Soldier] Hello, anyone there?

[Healy's sister moans]

[Water sloshing]

[Gentle music]

[Thunder roaring]
[Rain pattering]

[Gentle music]

[Vivandiere sniffles]

[Soldier] Hey.

The colonel needs help
and the surgeon's busy.

Come on.

We hold a service
another hour,

rains made any
bearing slow going.

I expect.

There's also the matter of

this creature on the loose.

This man, gunner foucher.

Partisan ranger?

No, sir, the grave robber.

[Bell rings]

Shh.

[Colonel] And
how is he a matter?

He is a disgrace to any man

who makes a pretext of
being civilized, sir.

He has been seen
executing wounded men.

He has been seen
robbing their corpses

for items of no military value.

So he has.

Colonel, it is our duty
to put a stop to him.

With what resources?

It took every ounce of blood

to keep the Yankees in
their place yesterday.

We have none to spare.

He sullies our cause
with murder and cowardice

and you propose to
let him go free?

Preacher, at any other
time it would be my pleasure

to place the noose
around his neck myself.

But this is not
civilization, this is war.

As long as the Yankees
control that territory,

they must be the
ones to police it.

He would be just
as happy to Rob US

if we were better supplied.

We can only pray
for such misfortunes.

[Colonel winces]

Miss, you would pay attention
to your duties, please.

Another harvest of corpses.

They engage again tomorrow.

[Boom vibrating]

[Exciting music]

[Grave robbers chattering]

[Dramatic music]

[Alan's sister groans]

[Wheel creaking]

[Dramatic music]

[Cannon creaks]

[Men chattering]

Not today, you understand?

Not today.

You think this is a bluff?

You can't make it around
before the federals arrive.

Turn back.

Turn back!

Turn back and you'll-

[gun fires]

[She gasps]

[Men clapping]

[Alan's sister moans]

Take your hands off of me.

[Dramatic music]

[Cannon fire booming]

[Colonel] This should
interest you, preacher.

Foucher's gang?

All that's left of it.

Seems they walked right
into a yankee howitzer.

[Preacher] Lord almighty.

But why is he here?

The vivandiere brought him in.

Thought he was one of ours.

I guess you'd say we
have as much obligation

to his soul as any other.

[Foreboding music]

Shh.

[Melancholy music]

[Older sister] August
3rd, 1864, dearest sister.

I'm sure know that
times have been hard

since your father's death.

[Melancholy music]

The state of the war
does not give US hope.

[Weapons booming in distance]
[Men yelling]

It would be easier

if you were here.
[Man moans]

[Person screams]

We're not sure you
owe the regiment this
sort of attachment.

However, we understand
your choice and.

[Dramatic music]

[Soldier] Hold to the line.

March.

[Anxious music]

[Vivandiere whistles]

[Rain pattering]
[Thunder booming]

Uh, what?

I don't understand.

How do you feel, soldier?

Cold, very cold.

I know, you're feverish,
but you're out of the woods.

The colonel needs
to see you now.

Colonel, who's,
who's the colonel?

Watch him, don't
let him move that leg.

[Thunder echoing]

Son, this will not wait.

You? You're, i'm
in reb country?

Yes, and safe.

Now they found you
near the railroad-

god damn rebs.

Damn rebs.

They found you near
the railroad track.

You might've seen-

I shouldn't be here.

I shouldn't be here.

Do the Yankees have
a railhead there?

We need to know.

No, I'm leaving.

I'm leaving.

Take your hands off me.

Take your hands off me!

[Vivandiere moans]
[Items clattering]

[Soldier moans]

He's bleeding.

He's bleeding bad.

Miss, get up.

Do not let this man die.

[Soldier moaning]
[Liquid sloshing]

Chloroform? This
will put US all out.

We cannot move him.

[Heartbeat pounding]

[Soldier moaning]

[Muffled speaking]

[Heartbeat pounding]

I can't stop it.

[Heartbeat pounding faster]

[Anxious music]

[Alan whistling]

How about that?

We get to ride in style.

They tell me you're the
only reason I'm alive.

Twice over.

You are something, magnificent.

[Older soldier] You all do
your best there, Carolina.

Why, we can't hardly get that
gal to say two words in a row.

Maybe you Missouri
boys need someone

to show you how it's done.

Tell me something else.

Do I also have this,
to thank you for?

Why me?

[Older soldier]
Y'all will meet up

with your compatriots
soon enough, Carolina.

Word is 21st north Carolina,

they alls just a waiting for US

at the end of this here march.

Maybe I should stay
close to this lady,

it seems healthier.

[Older soldier chuckles]

[Older soldier]
You Carolina boys.

[Tense music]

[Vivandiere coughs]

Oh, miss, a little late
for you to be out isn't it?

Ah, miss, you don't have
to waste that stuff on me.

I-

so, matches, matches.

[Tense music]

[Solder panting]

[Dramatic music]

[Wind blowing]

[Gentle music]

I asked before, why me?

God, keep you.

[Gentle music]

[Weapon explodes]

[Muffled scream]

[Men yelling]

[Guns firing]

[Fire crackling]

[Chaotic music]

[Men yelling]

[Metal jangling]

There's no railhead
there you said.

No such thing.

What then may I ask is that?

I was wrong.

I didn't know where I was.

[Alan yelps]

You lie to me again you'll
get worse than that.

There's men dead today
didn't need to be.

And how is it you were found

practically inside yankee lines?

What were you doing there?

Well?

I refuse to answer.

[Colonel] What's that?

That's my choice.

I refuse to answer.

[Alan yelps]

Stop it, that's enough.

He stayed behind with
the yankee wounded.

Miss, who is he?

This is my brother.

Your brother?

Private Alan Healy, 10th
Ohio United States army.

He is a wounded prisoner.

I demand you let me treat him.

Put him under guard.

Colonel, he is a
wounded prisoner.

Prisoner he is, miss.

But two days ago,
private Alan Healy

was brought to our
bosom wearing gray

and yesterday,
private Alan Healy

used those false pretenses
to give US false information.

And if private Alan
Healy cannot give

a good account of himself
at his trial tomorrow,

he will hang.

[Ominous music]

[Wind rustling]

[Alan's sister] My brother.

[Muffled explosion booming]

[Explosion booming]

[Man screaming]

[Alan's sister]
This is my brother.

[Mother] Bring him back.

[Metal twanging]

[Vivandiere breathes heavily]

[Dramatic music]

[Vivandiere cries]
[Crickets chirping]

[Older sister] Dearest sister,

we have had some hard
decisions forced upon US.

The loss of our property
was regrettable,

but inevitable given the decline

and faced without adequate help.

We will write to you as
soon as we're settled

and trust that anything
addressed to the regiment

will find you before long.

[Melancholy music]

[Dramatic music]

[Vivandiere coughs]

Am I needed?

Miss?

Leave her.

Leave her.

I know her.

She is from my town.

I remember when
she was this high.

Miss, he rarely drinks.

It's only after a battle.

Your father remarried
before the war.

Isn't that right?

I was glad of that.

I always felt a
little sorry for you.

You were so quiet.

He's not a spy.

He was not awake when I
put him in that uniform.

He did not know till later.

I should not have
done that, I know it.

But his sister she.

[Vivandiere breathes raggedly]

She helped me.

The day Josiah died
we could not save him,

but she helped me.

I knew who he was
when I saw him.

It was in his face.

I could not send him
back to her that way.

Well, surely his own side-

he would've died.

He would've died.

I could not leave him.

[Gentle music]

He was in a tight spot.

What could he do?

We started pressing him
with all those questions.

What could he say?

You can't deny what he told
US might've dodged a battle-

he will not hang.

That is my promise.

He will not hang.

Now, go back to your duties.

Go on.

Mercy is such a rarity.

I am an old beast.

That is another promise,

I will not be able to keep.

That would be a cruelty.

Preacher, she has
already been cruelly used.

He knew names from the 21st.

He knew their movements.

He came prepared.

She might've told him.

That child?

No, preacher.

No, I know her, remember?

She did not furnish
those details.

And now our provocateur

and that accessory of his
have bent her to their will.

She may have helped her brother,

but they are certainly
presuming on it now.

What is it you propose to do?

We are naive to think

that there are not more like him

this close to yankee territory.

Mercy is a chance
we cannot take.

[Uplifting music]

This court having found private
Healy guilty of espionage

condemns him to hang
by the neck until dead.

Sentence to be carried
out immediately.

My god have mercy on his soul.

[Soldiers chanting]

No, no, you are not his judge.

You have no right!

You broke a promise!

Keep your word, damn you!

Damn you!
[Gun fires]

Enough, enough.

Get this girl to
the surgeon's tent.

Let me go with her.

Please, let me stay with her.

Escort this man.

We'll send for him
when we're ready.

[She groans]

We have other business, sir.

[Frantic music]

[Train bell clanging]

How about it, yank?

Let your women do your
fighting for ya, do ya?

[Liquid sloshes]

[Other guard] They got to.

All they know is
standing in parade

and polishing their bayonets
and waving to the girls.

[Anxious music]

Ranks are so thin, heard they
got petticoats at Shiloh.

[Dramatic music]

[Muffled speaking]

[Train bell clanging]
[Locomotive chugging]

[Men yelling]

[Frantic music]

[Men yelling]

We had a stroke of
luck with this train.

[Dramatic music]

And now with the bridge in
hand, we have a rare chance.

[Sentry] Hey, you!

[Dramatic music]
[Train bell clanging]

[Locomotive chugging]

[Train whistle toots]

What the hell are you doing

stepping in front of
the train like that?

[Man groans]

[Pole clatters]

[Engineer groans]

[Train whistle blows]

That one, all the way forward.

[Steam hisses]

Now that one.

Too much, too much.

Stop that train!

[Soldier groans]

Get the horses.

Get after them.

[Horses neighing]

Lieutenant colonel,
run to the telegraph.

Block the line.

[Upbeat music]

[Dramatic music]

What is she doing?

Just don't get in her way.

[Dramatic music]

Ride.

[Dramatic music]

[Tense music]

[Dramatic music]

Miss.

[Fire crackling]

Peel off, boys, peel off.

That'll go off any second.

She did it for a reason.

[Dramatic music]

Let's go!

[Locomotive chugging]

No!

[Gentle music]
[Fire crackling]

[Horse hoofs pounding]

[Metal clanks]

[Explosion booms]

[Metal screeches]

[Bell ringing]

[Man whistling tune]

Excuse me, is
your mother around?

Ma's not seeing
anyone right now.

Well, Josiah,
we can always ask.

What is your name, sir?

[Foreboding music]

I, I do not think
she will see you.

[Ominous music]
[Gun trigger clicks]

Josiah, get inside, now.

Nonsense, nonsense.

Here, that is a
bonafide Jefferson
Davis dime, young fella.

Your ma ever show
you one of those?

Once coin of the realm,
now as rare as hen's teeth.

Do not think you can scare
me with this child at stake.

How much do you
want him to see?

[Crow cawing]

Won't you come inside, sir?

[Doors rumbling]

It'll be just a minute, sir.

She will see you.

What is this?

You've done well for
yourself, Mr. Healy.

It made you easy to find.

What I want has
nothing to do with him.

Then let him leave.

Auntie, the coffee's ready.

Take a seat, Mr. Healy, now.

[Doors rumbling]

[Crutch taps]

Mrs. Healy, you've had a
rough time of it lately.

A horse threw
her, two days ago.

The boy can go.

[Josiah] The
coffee's ready, ma.

Mrs. Healy, do
you understand me?

The boy can go.

You should leave.

This will not profit you.

I have no interest
in you or you,

only the betrayer.

I will have words
with you first.

They are 12 years coming.

[Cup clatters]

You should let the boy leave.

Why don't you let him leave?

Tell her, go on.

[Alan's sister] Never.

[Alan] We do not
get in her way.

So that is how you want it?

Fine.

There are boys who've
seen worse than he will,

when they were
younger than he is.

This is your last chance.

Josiah, would
you like a treat?

Here's what you need to do.

Stand up, face that wall
and cover your ears.

Then you'll hear a very loud
noise like papa's shotgun.

If you don't flinch or cry
or turn around before I tell,

you'll get a treat.

Do you understand?

If you can do that, all
will be well, I promise.

Colonel, gunner foucher never
met the Yankees that day.

He, met, me.

Now is your moment.

[Glasses pinging]

[Tense music]

[Trigger clicks]

[Dramatic music]

[Gun fires]
[Glass shatters]

Ma?

Darling, take him
into the kitchen.

We'll handle things in here.

No, you take him.

This is our job.

I want to stay.

Josie, you can't,
someone's hurt.

I know, I want to stay.

[Colonel moaning]

[Alan's sister] It's a
winging more than anything.

He has a chance.

Can we fix him?

Are you fearless
today, little Josie?

Maybe we can.

Like as not, cracked a few ribs.

Right now, it's the bleeding
we have to worry about.

[Vivandiere] You take
this, keep his head down.

Yeah, you traitors.

You vile turncoats.

What have you done to me?

Joe-fired adventuresses,
what have you done to me?

Shh.

[Gentle music]
