(film reel rattling)

(dark eerie uneasy music)

(radio signal hissing)

(Man) Now, come on, you
need to learn how to shoot.

(Evie) You said Mexico was safe.

Why are we still here?

(Man) I don't know if
Mexico is safe anymore.

I don't know anywhere that's
safe anymore.

Not since they started
dropping bombs on us.

Now, come on.

(Evie) I'm not gonna use that.

(Man) Just do what I
tell you. Don't be afraid.

You'll be all right.

(Evie) Killing?

Listen to me, there
is nothing on this earth

more malicious and vile than a man.

You see anybody out here, you run.

They're not gonna help you.

(Evie) What will you do?

We do what we need to survive.

(Evie) Is mommy in heaven

(sighs) You need to be
able to defend yourself.

(soft pensive music)

(Man wheezing and coughing)

(gentle guitar music)

â™ª Seven seals are decreed
until the final blizzard â™ª

â™ª But I was looking the other way â™ª

â™ª When the bombshell hit us â™ª

â™ª The trees were felled and
the buildings were scissored â™ª

â™ª So we ran like hell for the hills â™ª

â™ª While the bell ringers
rang their bells â™ª

â™ª The avalanches fell and
covered all the fields â™ª

â™ª The city was rubble and
the babies all squealed â™ª

â™ª And the stars fell down from the sky â™ª

â™ª Like the last handful
of a dead man's pills â™ª

â™ª Reflected in his widow's eyes â™ª

â™ª At a distance we watched the
city die â™ª

â™ª Her eyes were filled
and the weeping began â™ª

â™ª "Let me not be stilled," she said â™ª

â™ª Let me cry, let my tears
be endless â™ª

â™ª Don't try to pacify me
with television â™ª

â™ª Drink and anti-depressants" â™ª

â™ª For seventy years,
most of us were slaves â™ª

â™ª To our killers and oppressors â™ª

â™ª Some of us ran away
to die in the desert â™ª

â™ª Some of us stayed and
became homeless crazies â™ª

â™ª Somebody rolled me over in
the middle â™ª

â™ª Of a hangover and said to me â™ª

â™ª "Wake up drinker, your bottle is
empty â™ª

â™ª And all the off-licenses
have been ram raided" â™ª

â™ª Those days hit me like a cancer â™ª

â™ª Or like a terrible car accident â™ª

â™ª I thought I was safe, but I wasn't â™ª

â™ª We thought we were rich, and
we were â™ª

â™ª But now that means nothing â™ª

â™ª So go tell your children and
all your children's children â™ª

â™ª So they can tell their children â™ª

â™ª Write it in a book â™ª

â™ª And send it to the four
corners of the earth â™ª

â™ª So even the goyim can read
about Him â™ª

(Ann) You think we're safe here?

(Man) You don't have to worry.

(Ann) Is it right what we've done?

(Man) I haven't hurt anybody.

(Ann) Take care of our baby.

(Man) You don't have to worry.

(Ann) You think we're safe here?

(Man) I haven't hurt anybody.

(Ann) Take care of our baby.

(Man) You don't have to worry.

(Ann) Is it right what we've done?

(Man) I haven't hurt anybody.

(Ann) Take care of our baby.


(blood splashes)

(gun reloads)

(birds chirp)

(melancholic reed music)

(men chuckling)

(soft chattering)

(truck door thuds)

Well, now, if I'm not mistaken,

smells like you, boys
might have found yourself

a nice stash of coffee.

(lighter clicks)

(uneasy music)

You know, what really
goes well with a cigarette

is a good cup of coffee.

It's too bad we only got three cups.

Well, now that's not
very neighborly, now is it?

I think he must be lost.

(men chuckle)
No, no, no.

I know where I came from.

But see, thing is, I don't
really recognize you, boys.

Not from around here.

It must be pretty far away

from whatever hole you
crawled out of.

So where's your base camp at?

That ain't none of your concern.

Yeah, why don't you get going

while we're still in a good mood?

Well, see, the thing is,

I don't really like what I see here.

Shut up.

So what?

(Drac) Now that's a cute gun.

It's a nice truck you got up there,

kind of unfair the three
of us have to walk.

Yeah. I say we take it.

(Drac) You like to take things, huh?

Where'd you get that one?

(man in cowboy hat) Shut up.

I don't have to answer to you.

(Drac) Look, I know your
boys are new to this territory,

so I'll let you in on a little secret.

I'm law around here. You
understand?

Law? Horseshit.

Ain't no law around here.

(Drac) That's where you're wrong.

Now, am I gonna have to
correct you, boys,

or we're just gonna call
this a misunderstanding?

(uneasy music)


(gunshots echo)

(man thuds)

(woman crying)

I got you.

I got you.

(birds chirp)

(melancholic reed music)

You're dead.

Did you miss me?

Of course.

(gentle airy music)

(bonfire crackling)

Did you get enough beans?

I'm gonna finish them off.

Fine.

Well, you can sleep out
in the woods.

Actually, it's not fine.

Because as soon as we
get into that cabin,

you're gonna be farting all night.


I don't want to have
to share a bed with you

when you eat beans.

I can?

Yeah, sure. Be my guest.


You know, it's time to move on.

I found a really nice
place. You're gonna love it.

A cabin right by the lake.

Would be a good place to spend
the winter.

Did you see anyone?

(Man) No.

When was the last time you did?

Did what?

Saw someone.

I don't know.

There's nobody else up here.
It's just us.

(sighs) It's cold up in these
mountains.

Tell you a story.

There was these nuns.
They lived in Scotland.

And the Vikings were roaming
around,

killing people, raping and pillaging.

The nuns, they got the idea.

They cut their noses off, their lips.

That'd be so hideous.

Vikings would leave them alone.

The Vikings were disgusted.

They didn't leave them alone.

They locked them in their convent,

set it on fire, burned them all.

People like us need to hide.

That's why we're in these
mountains.

I got to keep you safe.

Well, did get me anything?

Oh, heavy.

I got you a few things.

I got a book, one of my favorites.

You can read it to me later.

Make room.

A broad glistening muzzle
showed itself

above the edge of the bank,

and the Otter hauled himself out

and shook the water from his coat.

"Greedy beggars!" he observed,
making for the provender.

"Why didn't you invite me, Ratty?"

"This was an impromptu
affair," explained the Rat.

"By the way, my friend Mister Mole."

"Proud, I'm sure," said the Otter,

and the two animals
were friends forthwith.

(uneasy music)

(Ann) You think we're safe here?

I'm law around here.


(Man) Haven't hurt anybody.

(Ann) Take care of our baby.

(uneasy music)

(thunder rumbling)

Well, there's a cow right there.

That's better than deer.

Here. You get to shoot it.

Wait. There's somebody else
out there.

Hey! Hey!

Hey, wait over here!

Hey, over here! Over here, hey!

Over here! Daddy, what are
you doing?

We need to help them.

Hey! Hey come back!

Daddy! What are you doing?

Daddy, we need to help them.

(uneasy music)

We need to get out of here.

Move!

(somber music)

(man whoops)

Faster! Faster!

We'll catch you! (whoops)

I know you're afraid.

It's a dangerous world and
you wanna keep me safe.

I get it.

You're just like your mother.

(Evie) Is that such a terrible thing?

No.

I love you.

You're all I have.

(melancholic music)

(Evie) Well, I forgive you.

(eerie music)

You animals had your fun?

(man with A beard) Yeah.

(soft airy music)

All right.

I call the bed.

We're gonna be sharing the bed.

Hey, look at this.

(Evie) What?

Come down here.

(Evie) What is it?

Oh, sweet, here. Just a second.

What is it?

(Man) It's a record player.

I don't think you've
ever seen one of these.

What does it do?

Plays music.

What?

(Man) Maybe it works. Oh!

(Evie) That's all it does?

Let's see what kind of
records we got.

Oh, classic.

â™ª 'Cause we were meant to
be together â™ª

â™ª It was written in the stars â™ª

â™ª Drinking up my wine
too early in the day â™ª

â™ª Smoking cigarettes, I
forgot to throw away â™ª

â™ª I'm looking out the
window thinking to myself â™ª

â™ª How did I end up here
with this heartbreak tale â™ª

(young girl laughs)

(music slowly fades)

(Ann) You think we're safe here.

Safe as we can be.

Is it right what we've done?

We haven't hurt anybody.

So this is it for us?

You want to go back to the city?

That's not what I said.

You don't have to worry.

Take care of our baby.

(suspenseful music)

Hey, I found one!

Where's my jar?

What do you want?

(stranger slurping)

You can sleep in the barn.

There's a trench latrine behind it.

Don't come back in this house.

I'll give you some food
and water in the morning.

Then I want you gone.

â™ª I am a poor wayfaring stranger â™ª

â™ª Traveling through this world
of woe â™ª

â™ª There is no sickness,
no toil, nor danger â™ª

â™ª In that bright land to which I go â™ª

â™ª I'm going there to see my mother â™ª

â™ª She said she'd meet me when
I come â™ª

â™ª I'm just going over home â™ª

(Evie) More.

It's time to sleep.

Who is that man?

Well, don't worry about him.

Will I ever have a friend again?

Yeah, I promise.

Now it's time to go to sleep.

You want to pray?

You pray.

Okay.

Our daddy in heaven, you are -

(crickets chirping)

(door screeches)

(woman shrieks)

(knife slashing)


(gentle airy music)

(Evie sobs)

(record player clicks)

All right, make me carry you.

So, yeah, you want to get
a little more water there.

Smooth that out.

You're doing good? You're
doing good.

(Evie) Mine is not as
good as yours.

(Man) It's fine.

(Evie) I'm no good at this.

(Man) You don't like it?

(Evie) No, I don't.

(Man) It takes practice.
You gotta practice.

That's how that works, right?

You see that egret out there.

Where?

Straight out there.
Oh yeah.

Is that dinner?

I don't think that'd be very good.

Little fishy.

I think I have a career in this.

It looks good.

I like the mountain. You
gotta get some water now.

Get your water there.

Actually. I think you could use-

What do I need?

A duck, right there.

(eerie music)

Daddy, daddy, no!

What are you doing?

Daddy, no, please.

Put the gun down.

Daddy, no. Daddy, please.

Just looking for hospitality.

This thing, It's not even loaded.

Daddy, no. Daddy, please.

Daddy, please. Daddy, no.

(tense music)


(gentle music)

No, you are a murderer.

He was gonna kill us.

No, he wasn't.

He was innocent, there
were no bullets in his gun.

Is this what mom would have
wanted for us?

Don't.

No, you know, I'm right!

You know, she wouldn't have
wanted this. Just me and you.

I said don't.

(Evie) There are good people out there.

Good people do not survive
out there.

I can't, I can't.

I can't be with just
you for my whole life.

Someday, you're gonna have
to be alone.

Evie!

Evie, stop!

(soft airy music)

â™ª I am a poor wayfaring stranger â™ª

â™ª Traveling through this w
orld of woe â™ª

â™ª There is no sickness,
no toil, nor danger â™ª

â™ª In that bright land to which I go â™ª

â™ª I'm going there to see my father â™ª

â™ª And all my loved ones who've
gone on â™ª

â™ª I'm just going over Jordan â™ª

â™ª I'm just going over home â™ª

â™ª I'm going there to see my mother â™ª

â™ª She said she'd meet me when
I come â™ª

â™ª I'm just going over Jordan â™ª

â™ª I'm just going over home â™ª

(branch cracks)

Hi. Who are you?

My name is Evie.

Do you live around here?

Wait, no, please.

Wait, wait, stop, please!

Wait!

(Evie gasps)

Wait!

Wait, please! (pants)

Hey, come back!

Hello!

(truck rumbles)

(truck rumbles)

(uneasy music)

I won't hurt you, I promise.

I can see you.

No need to hide.

I'm the sheriff around here.

I can keep you safe.

You can just take your time.
Come out when you're ready.

Who are you?

My name is Levi.

You're a sheriff?

I am.

Now, who might you be?

My name is Evie.

Evie? That's a pretty name.

You can't be out here by
yourself. Now can you, Evie?

No.

Why don't you take me to your camp, then.

No. My daddy would kill you.

We wouldn't want that, would we?

I don't want to go back. Not now.

Where you come from,

are there a lot of people there?

Yeah.

Yeah. There's a lot of people there.

And you can certainly join us.

Like I said, it's a safe place.

Can my father come too?

Yeah. Yeah, he can come.

Long as he promises not
to kill anyone, that is.

Now, why don't you come on with us

and we can show your daddy
that is a safe place?

We can be trusted.

We wouldn't want to have
to hurt him now, would we?

Now, come on.

Come on over here.

(anxious music)

That's it.

(uneasy music)

(truck door slams)

Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

(engine rumbles)

(door slams)

(engine rumbles)

(eerie music)

So, you're a sheriff?

You don't look that much older
than me.

How old is that exactly?

I'm 18.

I'm 16.

Only 16?

(Evie) You know, that
beard is not fooling anyone.

Well, that's why I carry a gun.

So, where are we going exactly?

Place where a pretty girl like you

can get whatever she wants.

How come my daddy's never
found your camp before?

He probably already has.

Just didn't want to tell you.

Look, it's not his fault.

You know, we might not look
like the most trustworthy bunch,

but I give you my word.

I'll look after you.

Now, it's just you and
your dad that are out here?

Mom or?

Yeah, my. My mom died a few
years ago.

Sorry. Truly I am.

I lost my family too.

Now, I have to warn you that
some of the men that I have,

they can be...

I have to play like the man,
you know.

You ever think I'm
mistreating or anything,

you know, just tell me.

It's just a show.

I promise you this, we're
gonna keep you safe.

No matter where we take you.

I'll protect you.

(uneasy music)

Don't worry. They're with me.

Now, come on. Let's go.

See you brought us another one.

This one's not for you.

(intense music)

(Evie cries)

I'm saving her for the Warlord.

You leave her alone

Got that?

(Evie) Please, Levi, please.

Quiet down, I gotta finish this.

Now bring the other two over here.

Get them loaded up.

Stay put.

You make a move, one of these
guys can do something to you.

Won't be very nice.

What are you waiting for?

Bring them over.

My daddy will save us.

They probably already killed him.

No, they didn't.

You don't know my daddy.

You think he can save you?

I know he can and he will.

And he will save you too,
I promise you.

(gentle somber music)



(man grunts)





(girls shriek)

I'll kill him!

One more shot.


(knife slashes)
(girls shriek)

Please, please, please!

(Evie shrieks)

This who you want.

Daddy, please!

This who you looking for?

(Man) Stop!

Stop!

(Drac) Come on down here.

Stop. That's far enough.

Take off all the weapons you have,
put them on the ground.


(eerie music)

(Ann) You think we're safe here?

Take care of our baby.

(Man) Evie!

Evie, stop!

(Drac) I'll kill her!

(Ann) Take care of our baby.

(Evie screams)

(Drac) This who you looking for?

This is your daddy, huh?

What we're gonna do with him?

What do you want?

I told you, you can come
to the camp,

as long as he promises not
to hurt anyone.

I'll work for you. I have skills.

Whatever it is, just tell me. I'll do it.

Oh, I've seen your skill.

I've seen you gunned down
my men.

(Drac hits)

Now, you made me kill that boy.

I didn't want to do that, okay?

His blood's on your hands now.

I see why you ran away now?

Look, I can't bring an animal
like this back to the camp.

(Evie mumbles)

I'm sorry.

I'll pay you.

You want this delicious thing back?

What, she for sale?

No.

She chose me.

(Drac hits)
(Evie shrieks)

(Drac kicks)

(Drac hits)

(Man coughs)

(Evie sobs)

I love you.


(Evie) Please, please, don't kill him.

I'm not gonna kill him.

I'm not gonna kill him,
I promise you that.

I won't.

But I can't have him
follow us back to the camp.

I'm gonna leave him here,

but he'll be alive when
we leave, I promise.

He'll be all right.

Please, please, let him go.

Sorry.

(tense music)

You're never gonna see
her again. You know that?

You think you could make a deal for her?

Sad.

You know, the kind thing
for me to do would be to,

would be to just kill you.

But I'm not gonna do that.

No. I made a promise.

And I always keep my promises.

Hope the coyotes don't get you.

(somber music)

Where did you find him?

He's not one of them.

Are you certain?

They took his daughter.

How many girls they hold up
there now?

You just gonna keep watching,
aren't you?

When are you gonna get tired
of all this sneaking around?

(Monk) Is killing so easy.

I'm done waiting. So are
the others.

Your monastery is a
refuge and that's great,

but it's not enough.

(Monk) Do you think
we have the strength?

They can kill me, but you,

you and the other women?

(Larkin) That's what his daughter,

that's what all those other
women are already facing.

Must be another way.

I'm not asking your permission.

It's time.

(monk sighs)

(somber music)

I want you looking your best.

You want to impress
the Warlord, don't you?

Does he have a name?

He'll keep you safe.

He'll take care of you.

What about you?

Right now, this is
the best thing for you.

I'll keep an eye on you.

And Maria?

What's she to you?

Where is she?

I'll do what I can.

Where will you be?

I'll be outside.

I thought you were important.

Smile.

â™ª The water is wide,
and I can't cross over â™ª

â™ª Neither have I wings with which
to fly â™ª

â™ª Build me a boat that can
carry two â™ª

â™ª And we shall row, my love and I â™ª

â™ª I leaned my back up
against a great oak â™ª

â™ª Thought it was a mighty fine tree â™ª

â™ª But first it bent and then it broke â™ª

â™ª So did my love prove false to me â™ª

â™ª The water is wide,
and I can't cross over â™ª

â™ª But I have the strength no,
not to cry â™ª

â™ª I'll build that boat
that can carry two â™ª

â™ª And we shall row, my savior
and I â™ª

(Warlord) You're trying
my patience.

You want food? Or should I let
you starve?

(suspenseful music)

(knife slashes)
(guard grunts)

Eat!

(arrow swooshes)
(man grunts)

I'll give you a good life.

You want that?

(Larkin over radio) We found
the girls.

Okay, I'm on my way.

(uneasy music)

(Warlord) Or should I
throw you in the whorehouse

with your friend?



â™ª Behold the rider on the horizon â™ª

â™ª Riding his horse through a
thousand miles of devastation â™ª

â™ª A pillar of smoke all around Him â™ª

â™ª Straight as an arrow â™ª

â™ª He rides through a thousand
years â™ª

â™ª Making a trail of blood â™ª

â™ª All the way from his cloak â™ª

â™ª In a dead straight
highway to the skyline â™ª

(girls screaming)

â™ª Doesn't blink once as
He follows his beloved â™ª

â™ª Into the city of buses,
billboards and pylons â™ª

â™ª The shadows pass and a
thousand angels â™ª

â™ª Fill up the skies and cry
"Hosanna in ex celsius" â™ª

â™ª His eyes are burning
with wrath so I ask â™ª

â™ª "Sir, is that your blood,
or is it someone else's" â™ª

â™ª He shows me the scars on
his hands â™ª

â™ª But his arm are strong â™ª

â™ª And I can't believe
that He could be beat â™ª

(glass shatters)

â™ª My jacket is dirty and he
hands me his clean clothes â™ª

(man screams)

â™ª "All the time, you're as
red as blood â™ª

â™ª But I'll make you as
pure as snow, my love â™ª

I'm trying to help
you, you stupid bitch.

Now quiet.

Quiet.

Come on.

No!

Wanna see what the next
group has in store for you?

I'm not going anywhere
without Maria.

Why is she in here?

We're getting out of here.

Are you alright?

I'm alright.

What happened to you?

(Maria) It doesn't matter.

Can you stand?

We need to get out of here.

With him?

(Evie) He's helping us.

(Drac) Let's move.

(distant gunshots)

(Evie) We don't have a choice.
Come on.

Grab some jackets. It's gonna
be cold where we're going.

Grab them. We gotta go.

(crow cawing)

(anxious music)

(horse neighing)

(arrow swooshing)
(man grunts)

(arrow swooshing)
(man grunts)

Larkin! We need your help.

Please, leave your horse with
Abigail and come with us.

Let's go.

(light guitar music)

How much further?
She's not feeling well.


(Drac grunts)

(Monk) Evie! Your father sent us.

No, wait, wait!

Go, go, go, go, go, run!

(Drac screams)

Come on, come on!

Let's go.

(light guitar music)

(bullet swooshing)
(Larkin grunts)


Go! Save the girls!

Just go!

(Monk) Come on.

(somber guitar music)

(arrow cracks)

(Larkin thuds)

(Larkin exhales)

(eerie music)

Go ahead, I'll fight him off. Go, go.

Leave us alone!

Just walk away.

I don't want to kill you.


(gloomy music)

(gun clicks)

(suspenseful music)

Maria, please, come on.

Come on, come on, come on.

Oh my God.

(Maria) Leave me.

(Evie) Never! Come on, Maria.

I'll keep you safe.

Leave us alone, okay?

No, no, I can't let you go.

Not after all I've done to help you.

What help? You're insane.

No, no. I did what I had to do.

I kept you alive.

(Maria) Please let us go.

We never asked for your help.

Evie, you don't
understand the world yet.

How cruel it is. I do.

Think these people were here
to help you?

Your dad and her brother?

No.

No, they're all weak.

But I,

I am strong.

That's why they're all dead.

If you'd stuck with
them, you'd be dead too.

Please just leave us alone.

We don't need your help.

We just want you to leave.

No, no, I put everything
keeping you guys safe

and I'm not gonna lose you now.

Look, you can't survive
out here on your own.

I'll protect you.

I know you don't believe me,

but I've always been here
for you, both of you.

I'll continue to keep you safe,
all right?

Maria, now I kept you
out of the whorehouse

the best way I knew how.

And Evie, what danger
where you in?

Warlord wouldn't hurt you,
limp-dicked as he was.

I'm not saying that this world
isn't shit,

or that, I always haven't been
pleasant,

but I freed you.

You understand?

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Okay.

Just come with me.

Now, come on.

Come with me.

(Evie hits and kicks)

(Maria thuds)

(Evie) Maria!

(Evie hits and kicks)

You're tougher than I thought.

(Drac kicks)

Now I should bash your head in!

I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do that.

I want to take care of you.

I wanna keep you safe, yeah?

You understand that?

I wanna make you mine.
(arrow stabs)

(gentle airy music)

Daddy, you're awake!

You're awake!

(light guitar music)

â™ª Though the mountains shake â™ª

â™ª Though the oceans roar â™ª

â™ª Though the earth may open
up and fall â™ª

â™ª Though the Powers gloat â™ª

â™ª And malice roams the land â™ª

â™ª Though the strongman
lifts his bloodied hand â™ª

â™ª May we yet be still â™ª

â™ª For the Prince of Peace â™ª

â™ª May we lay our crowns
before his broken feet â™ª


â™ª Why do you stand far off â™ª

â™ª Seeming there beyond â™ª

â™ª While the voiceless
hurting suffer long â™ª

â™ª O Jesus, how we need â™ª

â™ª The feet that bring good news â™ª

â™ª The hands that heal
the hurting and abused â™ª

â™ª May we yet be still â™ª

â™ª May our raging cease â™ª

â™ª May we make these days â™ª

â™ª Ready for His Peace â™ª

(gentle airy music)
