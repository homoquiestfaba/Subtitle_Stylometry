You see, I'm supposed
to want to do this.

And I don't.

I don't want,

nor do I feel good about doing
it.

So it's just, it feels weird
to...

I'm just trying to tell
you the truth here, you know.

It doesn't.

I don't have anything to sing.

Amazing grace.

Hey, Tommy, let's
come in here and listen.

Hey Tommy.

Hey.

You dig?

It's good.

Everything you do is good,
Tommy.

But it's not going on the
record.

Why?

It's too intimate to...

Fuck it, you know what, I don't
like it.

I don't believe you.

I think you love it.

I don't.

Sorry.

I think you love it.

Just like you love me.

And I think you wanna hate it.

'Cause I don't love you.

And you wanna hate it
cause it's not yours.

And that's just too fucking bad.

Well, actually it is mine.

I own every song that
you sing, you know that.

You're gonna go back to Capital
and you are gonna record

the songs that you said
you were gonna record.

And you're gonna do them as
they are demoed and charted.

And you're gonna do 'em on a
schedule

and you're gonna do the
physical and the photo shoot

and the fucking interview
and every thing that you hate

because that's what you
signed up for, okay.

You're okay.

Nah.

You nervous?

Hell yeah, I'm nervous.

Is she in there yet?

I don't fucking know,
sometimes she just seems

to disappear.

I don't even know when
she comes into the room.

Listen, assholes.

She can handle it.

She always has.

What are you talking about?

Yeah, you know the reason you're
here,

fucking babysitting her.

You think she don't know?

You think I don't know?

You think the whole studio
doesn't know?

I didn't know which brand you
wanted.

So I got you a variety.

You sure did.

Oh, sorry.

Also got your bunch of
juice to choose from.

So where's the vodka?

They called and told me not to...

Didn't get it.
Called.

That's okay.

It's not your fault.

It's okay.

Hey Joel, Connor, come on
out here and talk to me.

What are you guys so worried
about?

You worried about me?

'Cause I'm fine.

Tommy, you know, we just
thought that it'd be better

to finish the session before...

Sing a song for me.

How about "Strangers in the
Night?"

Everybody knows that song.

Yep, let's kick it.

Come on.

Tommy come on.
Please.

Come on.

All right,
Sing.

We get your point.

Come on.

Tommy come on.

There's no reason for this.

Look I know you can't sing.

Everybody knows you can't
sing, that's the point.

Because you don't do what I do.

You shouldn't be telling me what
to do.

That was never our intention.

I just need you guys to
understand what you're trying

to do to me.

And the only way I can
imagine that happening,

is if you do what I do.

So please, step up to the mic
and sing

because if you don't sing, I
won't sing.

Now, count it off again, Grady.

Just like that.

Please.

Keep going.

So we'll just try to get her to
do it...

Hey.

Where you going?

Out.

Tommy.

Look I can't control the
tour, you got insurance.

I'll be right back.

Fucking insurance.

Yes, fucking insurance.

I mean, could we be any further
away

than who we were when
we started doing this?

No, actually
we couldn't, you know.

Back then I actually loved you,

now I can't stand the sight of
you.

I'm not talking about all that.

I'm you know, I mean, look at
all this.

Oh my God.

Fuck it.

Fuck what?

Fuck what?

I mean, you know...

What?

The business that you're in,
huh?

The business that...

What? You one of those artists,
who's like, you know,

"Oh, I just missed the day, man.

I miss the day when we used to
work

in that little studio in my
garage, man.

Remember those days, man, it
was so much better coming up."

I'm so sick of this shit!

Do you really miss those days,
huh?

Do you really miss those days?

Tell me?
Maybe.

Because I remember a guy named
Dave

and you had no problem
throwing his ass out,

cause he couldn't get you
where you wanted to be.

I know...
So you are where you are.

Aren't you sweetie?

But I'm not
who I was 20 years ago.

But that's you.

Yeah.

That was your choice.

But you're here.

This is not about me.

Why are you making it about you?

You are not
who you were 20 years ago.

You are not that Memphis girl.

No, I'm not.

You are where you are.

You need to show some
gratitude and stop this shit.

Maybe you're right.

Maybe I should, show some
gratitude.

All love and gratitude.

You're right.

All the...

Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

What happened, huh?

What's going on?

I'm just not in the mood.

Tommy.

What's going on?
Just not in the mood.

So what do you wanna do?

You wanna go walk downtown,
find those guys you like

to hang with and kill yourself,
huh?

Is that it?
Kiss my ass.

Kiss your ass?

I've been kissing your ass
Kiss my ass.

For the past twenty
You got a lot of nerve

fucking years.
Talking to me.

I've been kissing your
childish ass...

No, no, no, I'm not the only one

that's been on this ride.
For twenty fucking years.

Fucker.

This is your fucking dream.

Whether you wanna realize
it or not, this is it.

You did it.

I did it with you.

You're not the victim of the
story.

Stop acting like this.

Don't you ever feel any pain?

Oh my God, I am so fucking sick
of you.

I am so fucking sick of you.

I mean, this is so boring.

Don't you get tired of this?

Don't you get tired?
Do you think I'm sick and tired?

Don't you fucking
get tired of this shit?

Don't you?

You fucking do your physical.

You stay the fuck away from me.

Just go do your goddamn physical.
Fuck your physical.

Okay, well fuck the physical.

You wanna throw it away?
Fuck your money.

Great. Let's throw it away.

We'll throw it away.
Oh, walk away.

Okay.

I'm not finished.

Hey Jay.

Hey.

How's the day?

You know, not that many people,

but I think you'll dig it, you
know.

Why don't you come on in?

I'm gonna go get a drink.

I won't be long.

There's no better
high than being on stage

singing for people.

So when the show is over.

When the lights are out
and people have gone home,

the only way to repeat it,

is to go for the whiskey,

pill,

smoking.

And when I smoke that stuff
and get high and I sing,

hell, I even like the way I
sound.

There's no better place to be.

I'm up there with the angels.

I'm up there with God.

It's a lonely, beautiful church.

And I'm the preacher.

Billy Holiday down in
Washington,

Kurt Cobain

Sylvia Plath, Chris Cornell,

Keith Lee, Graham Parsons,

Hank Williams, Amy Winehouse,

Tim Buckley, Prince, Ernest
Timmon,

Judy Garland, Hunter Thompson,

Virginia Woolf,

Jimmy Hendrix,

Whitney Houston,

Nick Drake,

Elvis Presley,

Tony Scott,

Donny Hathaway,

Alexander McQueen,

Elliot Smith,

Robert Johnson.

And they all have one thing in
common.

They were creators.

All right.

So Stacey, how was the crush?

She's taking her time
getting back to us,

but we'll get it done.

So she doesn't wanna do it?

Not really.

Why not?

Gail?

She doesn't wanna talk about the
girl.

That's what they're
gonna wanna talk about.

And to be perfectly honest,

I don't know why she needs to do
it.

All the dates are booked and
she's pretty much sold out.

So get off her back.

She needs to talk about the girl

because it's pretty
much taking over

the tour and the record.

We just need to just put it to
bed.

She's not gonna talk
about it, so that's that.

Okay guys, she's also
going on tour to sell records

and you don't have a record
to sell and that's a problem.

You're such an asshole.

That's enough.

Okay, look. Cole, are
we close to finishing?

Well, she's working and
it's really good stuff.

And there's no schedule for
that.

Why haven't
I heard anything Cole?

She's not ready.

All right.

What else?

The photo shoot an
interview with Oscar Mitchell.

That's confirmed.

That's exciting.

Well, it's not exactly
confirmed, confirmed.

I mean, she's probably gonna do
it.

She really likes Oscar.

It's important.

No, I know, I know.

I know that and as I said, I
think she's gonna do it, so.

How do we confirm, I think?

She doesn't really care what you
think

and she's probably gonna do it.

Stacey, you
wanna continue please?

Yes.

She doesn't want a new
cover, she wants the one

that she picked the same as the
billboard.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The one where she's
smoking and in real fur?

I don't think so.
That one.

I think it's really good.
No.

It's great.

Inappropriate.

It's edgy.

Is she gonna show?

I don't know what you
want me to tell you, Walker.

You've known her for twenty
years, so...

she'll deliver.

She always does.

Okay, great.

Thanks so much everyone.

Cole, can you stay behind a sec?

I heard you and Tommy put on
quite

a show at Capital.

Whatever.

I'm over it.

What's that mean?

It means I'm over it.

It means I'm done.

I don't wanna work with her
again.

This is last record, last
tour, last everything.

I'm absolutely done with this.

Don't don't even joke
about abandoning her.

She can't take that.

You just finish the record,
okay?

I know what she's thinking.

I should find her.

I should save her.

I should stay with her.

I should never let her outta my
sight.

She's wondering maybe it's
the girl at the concert

that killed herself.

She's wondering maybe it's her
fault.

Come on, Walker.

Find it.

Come get me.

Find me.

At least you'll know you tried.

Coffee.

Coffee, coffee, that one.

Dude, like she's gonna show.

Pull a fucking gangster dude.

Yeah dude, badass.

Yeah, totally.

You know, she's fucked up.

She's a drug addict, whatever,
who cares?

I love her.

Yeah.

You know my mom finally
divorced my shit bag dad,

'cause of her last song?

Yeah.
Dude.

Goddamn it.

She'll probably be here.

Oh you think this is a big
fucking joke?

This is all on us, okay.

This is our money, not
yours, not his, not hers.

And where's Oscar?

He's ten minutes away.

Well, it's pretty clear
that she's not showing up.

It's been two hours.

What?

Don't look at me, it's not my
fault.

Whatever.

You and Walker just keep
ignoring the damage.

I have never seen anything like
it.

Let me tell you
something... she's over.

Neither one of you guys wanna
admit that.

Fuck you, Timothy.

Hey, brother man.

Hey, Tommy.

Good to see you.

So, new record?

Tour?

What's this, fourteenth?

About that...

You're happy with it?

Yeah.

Tell me about it.

I think this might
be my last record, man.

Why?

My heart's given out.

Nothing in it anymore.

That's not so good, Tommy.

Yeah, I keep looking and
looking.

Nothing in there.

Can hardly hear it.

What are you hearing?

Mostly old stuff.

Mama's voice.

Santa Boat Creek.

Tony Jo.

Funny what we remember, huh?

Yeah.

What's that you used to sing?

Music.

Songs.

It's the singer who does
all the work for us.

Yeah?

Yeah.

People are born and died of
song.

Fall in love, have children.

Find themselves from their loss.

They remember, love and loss.

Makes 'em better, stronger
and more vulnerable.

All because of song.

Damn, man.

Sound like a poet.

Actually.

It's the intro to the interview.

Tell me more.

Their voices are not theirs.

It's given to them to share,

to fight from the day they are
born.

They die over and over.

They break their own
hearts, so we'll break ours.

From the beat of the heart.

To the drum to the gray.

New song?

Yeah, new song.

I'm gone.

See ya.

I'm Tommy Gold.

I know.

I'm Rodney Rod Waters.

I wanted to come earlier

and tell you how sorry I was.

I saw her before the show.

She was waiting for me.

And then she asked for
autograph and I gave it to her.

And then she hugged me
and wouldn't let me go.

My daughter was having a tough
time,

long before the other night.

She loved you.

She listened to you sing man all
the time.

Practically day and night.

So, nothing but Tommy Gold
around here all the time.

I'm just so sorry.

Sorry.

So many people
come to me and say,

"Your song got me through this
time."

"We got married to this song."

"When your baby was born,

we played that song
in the birthing room."

I soothe the soul when I sing.

Well.

A couple years ago, a
little girl killed herself,

listening to my music.

I mean, she was listening
to me when she decided...

So I went to see her daddy

and all he could do was
put his arms around me

and tell me how much she loved
me.

And thanked me.

Thanking me.

Ah.

I know that song.

Let's do that.

It's cold in here.

I'm cold.

One more time, I can't get it
right.

One more time.

Like shit.

You know what I mean?

Right there, you're coming back
on the, yeah, on the chorus.

Yes.

He's been showing up for a
while, but never for this long.

Nobody sees him but me.

I don't know if he's
the dark or the light.

The devil or an angel,

Maybe he's the singer's angel.

So listen, man.

After tonight I'll hop
on a flight to Memphis.

Need to see some old friends.

No problem.

I'll take you to the airport.

LAX or Burbank?

I got a car.

You sure?

Yeah, you know, I need
to get away for the tour.

I love you.

I love you.

Go get your girl, take a few
days off.

I love you.

How about I just take
you to the airport?

I'm good.

You know, Elvis?

Some.

You know Hank Williams?

Some.

You're the singer's angel.

Sometimes.

I haven't heard from her.

What do you mean?

She hasn't returned my calls.

Cool.

I went to Stanley and she's not
there.

I haven't heard from her
since she turned in the CD.

This isn't good.

I don't get her,
why didn't anybody tell...

She's not returning my calls.

Great.

Find her, Cole.

Great.

We gonna put
that on a fucking T-shirt?

You guys are so naive.

I swear to...

Wait, wait, what does that mean?

Well, if you're not worried
about her,

then why do we even have to talk
about it?

Well, we are worried about her.

Where do you think she
went on a fucking vacation?

I don't know.

Tell us where you think she is.

It doesn't matter where she is.

Wherever she is, she's in
trouble.

If she is even hearing...

What the fuck?
What does that mean?

Hey, could you
tell Tommy I'm here?

I can't get her on the phone.

I can't get her anywhere.

I haven't seen her, I'm
here to pick up the check.

Oh, okay.

Could you let me in or do you
have a key?

Or could you just go in

and see if she's there?
No, I don't have key, sorry.

She took the key back.

She doesn't want to be bothered.

She doesn't want to be
bothered, I won't bother her.

Fuck.

Carlton, Jake, let me
know if you've seen Tommy,

will ya?

I dunno where she's gone.

I'm worried, I'm kind of
worried.

Let me know will ya?

Thank you.

Hey, Al, is she there?

No, no, yeah, I'll call her.

All right.

Yep.

Yep.

Shit.

Why can't we just admit
what everybody knows is true?

Come on.
She's not coming.

She's not coming to rehearsal.

She's not coming to the show.

She's not fucking coming.

Just shut up.

James, if you guys cared about
her,

as much as you say you do,

you would've intervened before
now.

No.

Shit.

What are you losing by
doing this?

My memories, I guess.

All that stuff I've been seeing.

I know there's something else.

I'm sorry.

Find grace.

When we kill the creators,

we might as well tell the wind
to stop.

All that beauty that
allows us to dream, ends.

We're just workers, moving
door to door, picking up dust.

When we kill the creators,
we become reduced

to the lowest form of ourselves

and our most primitive desires
take over.

When we kill the creators
without malice,

or predetermination, without
even knowing what we've done,

we disconnect the conduit
between God and ourselves.

And that leaves us average.

Okay. So cool.

This is what we need to do.

Ah, Edward, the strange
things that's heading on out.

Find a way to get there.

Yeah.

Nice.

Fine tune.
Alright.

Wow, okay.

That sounds amazing.

Yeah.

But it sounds
good with the piano right?

For that one...

Strange things is great, yeah,

because that's the key link.

That's the key link to that.

Yeah.

You know the big fat bass?

Yeah.

If you could really just open it
up.

I smell it.

I smell it, sometimes
I have to roll in it.

It's real tempting
to do that third part.

It is I know.

You are a singer.

Why don't we try it?

I think it should be

Sing in on that.
