-Howdy.
-Hey, how's it going?

I don't know much
about these trucks,

but my truck just died,
I don't know.

Do you know anything,
could you maybe

give me a hand there?

I don't know too much more
than you, I'm sure.

Yeah.

But I can at least
take a look for you.

Okay, I appreciate it.

It might be the spark plug,
I'm not really sure.

Look right... Be careful,
right in there, yeah.

Right.
! Shit!

Yeah, watch it...
Yeah, it's hot now.

-Pardon my language.
-Yeah.

That's all right, that's fine,
brother. It don't bother me.

-I mean, I gotta...
-Be careful in there, now.

<b>SACRAMENT</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

Why?

'Cause it's time
to get up.

Five more minutes.

Nope.

You gotta get up now.

Fuck you.

We really need
to get on the road.

I told you that last night
when you were like...

"Babe,
just one more drink,"

and then you finished
the entire bottle.

Really?

Please explain to me why the words
"butt pirate" are written on my car.

I'm so ready to hear this.

Jeff and Alex got a little
extra-drinky last night.

I think they thought
it'd be funny.

And you just let them do it.

I'm sorry, baby.

I was in no condition to traverse
the perils of Mount Apartmentstair

in my state.

Look.

I know these past couple of
days haven't been easy for you.

But we're going to make up
for it this weekend. Okay?

Okay.

Everybody up.

You drooled
on my foot, stupid.

I love watching
your ass when you walk.

Holy shit.

I'm sure there's a reason, but why
are we leaving at freaking dawn?

Hey. If I have to do it,
so do you.

Damn, you want me to
puke all over you? Damn.

Suck it up, dude.

It's time to get up, bitch.

We gotta hurry. We don't want
Swissy Missy getting all pissy.

That's hot cocoa.
This is coffee, genius.

My God!
Whatever.

I'm already ready, you butch.

Do not light that in my house.

I wasn't gonna. I was just
getting it ready for the road.

Everybody, let's go!
Move, come on.

Hey, okay!

Hey, wait.
Who wrote all over Lee's car?

I can't help but notice that you
didn't get so festive with your car.

Yeah, but I drive
the Mu-tang, Dad.

I gotta keep up appearances,
you know, for the ladies.

Do you know how many miles
I get to the gallon?

Here.

At least you'll be getting use
out of some kind of rubber.

Damn! I thought you people were
supposed to like balloons and glitter.

Thought it'd make you
all rainbow-happy and shit.

What the...

No!

No!

What the fuck is that?

No! Na.

Not fuckin' me.

Come on, mother...

Come on.

Come on, you fucker.

Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay.

So what weirdness are you subjecting
us to for breakfast this morning?

Because hung-over or not,
I gotta eat.

We just wanted you to experience
that whole "Southern hospitality."

Just as long as I never have
to see another freaking grit.

God, you people eat
weird shit down here.

Grits are good.
-They're nasty.

Hey, have you checked
on that storm lately?

You know, it's going to be
raining all fucking week

and we're going to be
stuck inside the whole time.

You are so negative.

Your face is a negative.
Just checked it, bitches.

It looks like
it's still heading north.

Hurricane Bertha,
get to steppin'.

Hey! It's that playground I used
to play at with my grandpa.

So...

So what?

So did you get
with either of them?

I'll get there. Don't you worry about
that, you pussy-whipped old prick.

You do realize
I'm in the car, right?

My God. Don't.

All I'm saying is
the groundwork takes time.

The ladies,
I mean, the bitches,

can't know
we're running games on them.

You guys are idiots.

Either of you happen to know
what's up with Blake?

He passed out way early last night
and I think I heard him crying.

I don't know. Something to do
with his grandparents.

I guess they heard about him and
Lee and disowned him or some shit.

What, like they didn't know?
How could they not know?

Well, sir,
that is one heck of a story.

Yes, sir, one heck of a story.

Would you excuse us for just
a moment, Mr. Ranscombe?

I see the sheriff, and I want you to
tell him just exactly what you told me.

Can you do that for me, son?

-Yes, sir.
-All right.

Maybe when we get back, we'll help you
with that hand. We'll be right back.

Yeah. We'll be right back.

<i>Well. Are you in jail again?</i>

No, Ma, not again.

<i>Caller ID says
the police station.</i>

Yeah.

<i>I mean, I'm telling you, I'm really
tired of these kinds of calls.</i>

<i>-Yes.
-What's going on now?</i>

<i>-I don't...
-Where are you?</i>

I don't know!
I'm in Middle Spring.

<i>-You need to grow up.
-Yeah.</i>

<i>Talk to me. What's going on?</i>

<i>Listen, I am so tired...</i>

Ma, can you please
just come and get me?

<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

<i>I'll be there shortly.
I love you.</i>

You, too.

Well, son. Sounds like you had
yourself one hell of a morning.

Say, I didn't mean
to overhear,

but did I hear you on the
phone talking to your family?

Did you tell them you're
all safe and sound right here?

Yes, sir, my...

My mom's supposed
to be coming to get me.

Good boy.

Well, while we're waiting,
if you don't mind,

would you just kind of run through the
whole thing for me one more time?

Could you do that?

I was so scared, I...

I just didn't know
what else to do.

Hold on a sec.

Yeah.

You sure?

Well, that's what
I was afraid of.

So, I guess, do you want me to tell
you the rest of the story now?

Sheriff! That's him!

Now, son,
son, settle down!

I'm gonna have to apologize
for Brother Simon here,

he should've been
a little more careful.

What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you fucking crazy?

You're supposed to help me!

Son, if you just settle down and
cooperate, it's gonna go a lot easier.

Had to be a smartass and grab somebody
from outside of town, didn't you?

Well, call the doctor.

Somebody gonna tell me how this little
son of a bitch got away from the hunter?

No, no. You're not listening
to me. I'm telling you.

I just talked to him a couple of hours
ago and everything was just fine.

I understand, Mrs. Ranscombe.

Hopefully, we're just dealing
with shock,

and after
a few days' observation,

we can be sure that he won't be a
danger to himself or anyone else.

He did attack a deputy,
after all....

Doc.

Ma'am.

I hope you understand this really
is the best thing for him.

Now my deputy is not going
to press charges.

We wanna make sure your son's
getting all the help he needs

so this kind of thing
doesn't happen again.

...Can I see him?

Why don't we just see
how things go tonight, and...

Go home, get some rest. I'll give
you a call with an update tomorrow.

-Can we do that?
-I guess.

Weren't no dog! It was him.
You know it was him!

Yeah, but if he wasn't
Isaac's boy,

he would've been put down
like a dog by now!

I just don't know how the hell
he keeps getting out!

I'm really sorry about that.

Please, let's just...
Let's just go outside.

You didn't think I was hanging
around you bitches, did you?

But we wuvs you, Jennifer!

Come here, come here.

...Let it happen.

Too far.

<i>Mama will fix you
right up, sugar.</i>

She loves it.
She doesn't.

<i>I see
a world filled with evil.</i>

<i>They sell it to your children
on the television.</i>

<i>They sell it to your children
through the music.</i>

<i>Your children are being
filled up with these lies.</i>

<i>They say, "Love the sinner,
hate the sin."</i>

<i>I say, "No!"</i>

<i>All manner of perversion
has to be accepted?</i>

<i>I say, "No!"</i>

"No" is right, asshole.

Food! Food!

So why are we stopping?

Well, A,
the Mu-tang needs gas.

We can't all be eco-freaks.

Two, I need to go
drain my hog.

And C, well...
Okay.

We're going inside. Whenever
you're ready to get moving.

Man, what are you doing?

Sorry, ma'am,
that was our fault.

Y'all looking for anything
in particular?

We got a little bit of just about everything
back there, there's even some clothes.

They're used, but ain't
nothing wrong with them.

Maybe something to eat?

My wife's cooking up
a mess of barbecue.

I don't think so.

You sure?
She's a heck of a cook!

It is pretty darn good.

Just made up
a batch of biscuits, too.

You look like
you could use a good meal.

You're so thin.

No, ma'am,
I think we're good.

Thank you, though.

"Ma'am"!

"Ma'am."

Hear that, old man?
"Ma'am" and "sir."

Some young'uns
were raised up right.

Totally hideous,
like I expected.

Well, I expected more hideous.

I heard... Okay, stop it.

You're being weird.

How about this?

Why're you pulling on me?

You're pretty.

Hope I can be that pretty
when I grow up.

My gosh, aren't you sweet?
What've you got there?

What is that?

Why won't you let me read it?

Guess if the lizard was smaller, it
wouldn't take so long to drain, right?

Take home some barbecue, it's
all made up and ready to go.

Well, thank you, ma'am.
How much do we owe you?

Don't worry about it,
not one bit.

Be careful on those old roads, though.
There's a big storm a-coming.

-Okay, thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

Hey, pops, I don't suppose
you take plastic? No?

Couldn't get
much worse than this.

Hi. Can I get you
anything, miss?

Honey, are you all right?

Kids.

I just wish
they came with a manual.

Well, we can put 'em
on the right path,

but it's up to them
to make the choices.

This one's in
a lot of goddamn trouble.

They've got him under observation
up there at that hospital.

Now, dear, the good Lord didn't have
anything to do with that, did he?

No, but he doesn't seem to be
doing anything about it, either.

Jesus, I mean...

We can't have that kind
of talk in here, missy.

We just can't.

Do you have
a powder room, ma'am?

Why, dear, of course.
It's right down there.

Thank you so much.

Excuse me.

No, excuse me.

Fuck...

Now we just can't have you taking the
Lord's name in vain again, can we, sweetie?

Just lie still.
The less you move...

The less it's gonna hurt.

I promise you.

It'll be quick.

Why...

That ought to
keep him quiet for a while.

Darn it, old man.

Now I've gotta mop
the floor again.

-Put her in the kitchen where I can drain her proper.
-All right. All right.

Here we go.

What is this
supposed to mean?

What, now I'm supposed
to speak inbred redneck?

I don't know, you seem to know
everything else.

Shut up.

Are we there yet?

We're closer, but I was thinking
maybe we could stop for the night.

Why don't we stop up there?

How can you think
about more barbecue right now?

Didn't you have enough of that
drippy meat at that store?

Do you really think anybody in this
car has got enough hot, drippy meat?

My God.

Dear God, please tell me this
isn't where we're stopping.

Anyone wanna bet there's
no pool, bar, Internet,

anything even vaguely
interesting or modern?

Take a look in that bag
under the floorboard.

I think
I got your bar covered.

Really?

Nice!

But it doesn't look like
you got enough for you.

Shit.

You better learn to share if you
want some more of this weed.

Holy shit, do you smell that?

Smells like somebody's
got the munchies.

As thrilled as I am that you
wrote "butt pirate" on my car,

I think it wouldn't have
taken us so long

if we didn't have to
stop by a car wash.

Alex just wants love.

Relax, princess. Relax.

You're my princess.

How y'all doing?

Y'all need some rooms?

Why, yes, ma'am.

Unless I can help you
fold them sheets first.

Two rooms for you?

Yes, ma'am,
that'll be fine.

Good.
'Cause that's what I've got.

One room for the boys,

and one room for the girls...

Unless any of
y'all's married....

Didn't think so.

Bud!

Bud! You hear me, boy?

You help these young'uns
get their things upstairs.

Then you get back down here and you
finish up your chores, you hear me?

Yes'm.

Let me get that.

-Here, I'll take that.
-My bag!

I can take mine.

You got my bags in here.

Yeah.

There, man.

I think I see Shell's pool!

You boys are going to have
to give us a little while.

Well, shit. You don't waste
any time, do you?

Where exactly am I
supposed to sleep?

Well, Big Daddy,
you can share with me.

You'll keep me
nice and warm....

Or you can lay on the floor. What
the hell's the big deal anyway?

The queers are sleeping
over there.

Shit, man, I just don't like being
that close to another dude.

Fuck me!

Fuck me hard! Alex!

I have no intention of spending a
lot of time in this room anyway.

It's all yours.

-You've been working out.
-Thanks, baby.

What's wrong?

Have you seen
my earring anywhere?

I think that creepy lady
downstairs ate it.

Maybe it's in the car.

Jesus fucking Christ!

No, but it's as close as
you're going to get. My God.

Don't you know how to knock,
motherfucker?

Don't you know
how to wipe?

Come on, baby, I found us
a little place to take a dip.

A skinny one, even.
Okay, let's go.

Your hipster-geek fetish
disturbs me sometimes.

Whatever.

Get it in while you can, girl.
We're out of here in the morning.

Don't wait up, ladies.

Entertain me.

We have to cut through
these lies

with the sharp blade
of The Word.

Amen.

We have to feed our children
on the truth.

-Amen.
-Hallelujah.

We have to plant the seed
of that truth

in our children's bellies,
and watch it grow.

Amen!

No more can we let
these blasphemers

starve the souls
of our children.

Hallelujah.
Amen.

When these people come into our
lives, we have to show them the way.

Amen!

I don't know how they do it,

but this food has been touched
by the angels.

Ain't you eating, hon?

There's nothing here
I can eat.

What do you mean? There's a whole
plate there right in front of you.

I'm a vegetarian.
I don't eat meat.

Get yourself some tuna salad.

-Tuna is meat.
-It ain't. It's fish!

Fish is still meat.
You know, a dead animal.

Well, here, you just eat
some of them baked beans.

You can just pick
that bacon right out.

Here,
I'll take the bacon.

What's wrong, little sister?

There's meat in everything!
I can't eat it.

You see, little sister, a man's
faith allows him to eat anything.

But a man whose faith is weak
eats only vegetables.

Hungry!

Hungry!

Hungry!

Hungry!

Hungry!

Shut up, you crazy fuck!

Hungry!
-Quiet!

I don't want to hear
any more out of you!

-Hungry!
-Stop.

Shut up!

Shut up.

Shut the fuck up.

Shut up!

Shit. What now?

What?

No!

Hungry! Hungry!
Hungry! Hungry!

Get The Hunter out here now.

I'm not going into the woods
after that crazy prick.

I don't care whose kid he is.

Come on. He couldn't
have gone that far.

Fuck.

Fuck it.

Fuck.

Bitch.

Fuck me!

Motherfucker.

What the fuck
is this shit?

Shoes? Yeah.

No.

That's right.
Motherfucking shoes.

Come on, now, get the fuck on.

What the...
What the fuck?

Fuck. Fuck.

Drink.

Mom... Mommy?

What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

I just don't know if I'm
reaching them, brothers.

We are going to have
to push even harder.

I think you're right, but...

Don't think grabbing them off the
street is a great way to start.

Yes, sir.
I heard about that boy.

Got to be smarter, Simon.

Picot hadn't worked
as quick as he did,

we would be
in a world of spit right now.

I know.

And you're right.
It won't happen again.

Now listen.

We have to start with the
folks we know we can trust.

But brother, when you're
talking about more people,

you're talking about
more mouths to feed.

I mean, how can we make sure
we have enough?

The revivals, they help.

But if enough people
go a-missing,

then somebody is going to ask
questions that we can't answer.

It doesn't matter.

We have to save as many of
these lost souls as possible.

We'll just have to expand
the stables we have.

BeBe says she's got at least six
feeders ready for harvesting,

and if we're careful...

I'm sorry to disturb you,
Brother Isaac.

BeBe's got a whole mess of kids
staying down at the hotel.

Maybe some of those "lost
souls" you were talking about.

Number one, we need to get
that Hunter out of the woods.

Yes, sir.

And two, we need to start
the harvest close to home.

Those kids over at BeBe's?

Divide and conquer, brothers.
Divide and conquer.

I need to get back
to my flock.

Brahm, take a couple of boys,
and be smart about it.

-Don't let me down.
-But Daddy...

Son, you're the only one
I know I can trust.

When I'm gone, it will be you
up on that pulpit.

Okay, Daddy.

You heard him, boys.

And you're right, Simon.
We do need more food.

But if you fail us again, you won't
have to worry about who's eating what.

Got me?

Jesus!

What's wrong?
Are you scared of the dark?

-You didn't hear that?
-What, the thunder?

Thunder, my ass,
those were gunshots.

My God, bullshit. Blake said
storms were headed this way.

Come on.
Are you coming or what?

Shit.

Damn it.

That's why
I shook mine out, smart guy.

Look, I think we need
to get back.

I'm telling you,
those were gunshots.

My God, and I'm telling
you, it was just thunder.

Now, do you want to
lie down here with me,

or do you want to go back
to your boys at the hotel?

You got all the answers,
don't you?

Not all of them.

Well, that didn't take you
too long, did it?

Babe?

-"Meats for the belly..."
-What the fuck!

"...and belly for meat."

Who the fuck are you?

"But the Lord shall
destroy both it and them."

Let her go!

"Now, the body is
not for fornication,

"but for the Lord, and
the Lord for the body."

Get the fuck off me!

Shell!

Brothers, let's help these
sinners cleanse themselves.

Shell!

Let her go. Shell!

"Wash me completely
of my evil..."

Shell! Let her go.

Get off of me.

"...and purge me from my sins."

-Amen, brothers!
-Amen!

Shell! Let her go!

Shell!

Shell!

Why are you doing this?

Get off of me! Fuck!

Get off of me.

Time to wash your sins away,
too, brother.

Go, go, go.

All right, give it to me.

Drink.

Hell, yeah.

You know,

for someone so worried about
sleeping next to another guy,

you sure don't mind sharing
this shaft with me.

Pussy.

Besides, the smoke
totally sterilizes it.

-Okay, buddy.
-What?

Looks like we're stuck.

We might as well just
go home tomorrow.

No, Boo.

Boo is right.
I don't want to go home yet.

Shit, you want to stay here?

At least if we go back now,
we can party for real.

Not that fucked up, buddy.

So, I'm hungry.

Who's hungry?
-Yeah.

I could eat.
You can always eat.

Baby?

Baby?

Let me guess, do I get to be
the one to go and get it?

Well, the rest of us are
way too fucked up to go.

Seriously?

Handle your high.

Hey, you think there's a burger
place open? No, I don't.

Cheeseburger?
Nope.

No.

Chocolate sundae?
Zucchini? Okay.

Pizza?
Corn dog?

-No.
-Come on.

You are going to eat
whatever I bring you.

I'm going straight there and coming
straight back. Try not to destroy anything.

Since when do you
do anything straight?

So you want grits.

Okay, and you want
vagina, so...

Love you.
Love you.

You going out alone tonight?

You almost
scared me to death.

I'm just going to go grab some
food for me and my friends.

You have a good night.

You, too.

What's up?

So, Lorri, how's it going?

How's what going?

You know, things,
life, whatnot.

Life's not really "whatnot,"
but it's going just fine.

Do you want to maybe go somewhere
a little bit more private?

You know,
just the two of us?

You know, going somewhere more
private sounds really good.

But you should probably
go by yourself.

I have some lotion and tissues
in my bag if you get lonely.

I just... I don't want
to be your pity fuck.

You know what? Fuck you guys.

Wait, don't go.

I'm sorry, sir,
that was... That was my fault.

No apologies necessary, son.

If I wasn't so full
of Mama C's cooking,

I'd be navigating
by sense of smell myself.

Have a good night.

Thank you very much.

Can I get two of these
to go, please?

Be right with you, sugar.

Tell them I'm on my way.

Now they just told me
we've got no more meat ready.

But if you give me
just a minute,

I'll make sure
you get fixed up right.

Can you wait for just a couple,
sugar? I promise, it'll be worth it.

Sure, that's fine.

Now you just go and sit
yourself right down there,

and I'll be back
quick as I can.

Yes, ma'am.

What are you doing letting me run
out of meat out there on that line?

And don't you tell me
we got no more!

We've got something for you,
Mama C!

Call it...
Call it an offering.

"An offering,"

"Go out into the flock and
find me two fine young goats.

"I will use them to prepare
your father's favorite dish."

Go and get the other one.

"And the eyes of all
look unto you,

"and you will give them their
food in due season, brothers."

Now, I'll be back soon. And you best
have them cleaned up and ready.

Well, damn, babe.

You took for, like, ever.

My God,
you missed it.

Alex was like,

"I love you, Lorri."

He was on the bed,
laying almost on top of...

Alex was like, "I want to stick
my hot dog in your taco."

I'm serious.

Do we have to do this?
Like, kind of.

Really?

Hey, you're the one
that got him all pissed off.

Alex left pissed off.

You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

Dead serious,
may God strike me down.

Bitches.

So, nobody knows
where he went?

Nah, fuck him.

Classy.

Bitches!
That's all they are.

What did I do?
I just wanted a little play.

What the fuck?

Keep him quiet, boy.

Boy needs a little
cooling off, son.

Let go of me!

No!

So he's high, drunk,
and pissed off,

and you guys just let him roam
around a town he doesn't know.

Right?

He'll be fine, babe.

Okay, just stay here.
I'm going to go look for him.

Holy hell!

Good Lord Almighty.

I just come up
to tell you kids,

your friend, the big one...

Sheriff just took him in.

What?

Sheriff said he would
let him go in the morning.

Boys will be boys, but he was just
raising too much of a ruckus.

Now, good night.

Thanks, ma'am. I think.

Fuck.

Shit.

Fuck.

What?

Did you see Jeff
come in last night?

<i>Nein. I saw nassing.</i>

Awesome.

What?

Cuddle me, jerk-face.

Better.

I'm trying.

Wait, there's no...

Well, aren't you
the prepared little scout.

You should see the rest
of the badges I earned.

Really?

With us five feet away?

I...

Yeah, your little pincushion
said that already.

I smell breakfast.
You bitches do what you want.

I'm going to take
a nice hot shower.

And the three of you could
probably use a cold one.

I thought I was
going to get a hell of a show.

Sorry?

It's all good.
You want to go get breakfast?

Sure.
-Sure.

Ma'am.
Is this all for us?

Well, I figured it was
the least I could do,

with your friend being
"on ice," so to speak.

Everybody else
is at the revival anyway.

About that. Could you tell us
where the sheriff's office is?

We'll need to go
bail him out, I guess.

I wouldn't worry
none about that.

Sheriff will let him go just as soon as
he sobers up. Should be any time now.

And them other two...

Jeff and Shell.
-Them.

They came through here
early this morning,

said they would
see you all later on.

Went looking for a lake
they saw on the way in.

Again? What the hell.
And are these grits?

Come on, baby. Let's go.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Besides, Alex probably
isn't even out yet.

Maybe we should bring him
a cake with a file in it?

All right. Let's go in.

My God.

-That's really...
-Cool.

-This stuff is crazy!
-Is that... Is that a buffalo?

I think it's a moose.

They have dresses.

-Morning, ma'am.
-And good morning to you.

I'm sorry about my friends,
they're a little loud.

Loud?

Y'all just let me know if I
can help you with anything.

Thank you, all right.
I should...

Do you think you guys could
tone it down just a touch?

Who, us?

My God.

Come on, baby.
Have a little fun.

Come on, baby.
Have a little fun.

Okay, okay.

Do you like it?
No.

Okay, so I think this would be
perfect for in our kitchen,

like, right above
the buffalo head.

Nah.

It's really... I mean,
you can just... Do-do, do-do.

No!

No.

Kind of looks
like your dad. A little bit.

How much?

It's not that much.

Please? You know you like it.

And I have
just the spot for it.

-There you go.
-Thank you.

Got yourself a good man there,
young lady. Don't let him go.

Who, me? No. He belongs to
little dancing queen over there.

I see.
You all have a good day.

Let's go, guys.

-So?
-So, what?

So, what now?

What's the plan,
fearless leader?

My plan is to go back
to the hotel,

pack my stuff, and...

You want to finish
that sentence?

It's Alex. I guess the sheriff
let him out.

So, where is he?

Says he...
He's been out looking for us.

Over by the church now. He says
he wants Lorri to come meet him.

He wants to apologize
for last night.

My ass.

What about Jeff and Shell?

He says they're back
at the hotel, waiting on us.

I guess they're packing, I...

I think you should just come
back to the hotel with us,

and he can meet us there,
and apologize,

or whatever it is
he wants to do.

Look, I know he's a dipshit,
but I was really hard on him.

Besides, maybe
he's actually sorry.

Look, I'll just go over
to the church and get him,

and I'll meet you guys
back at the hotel.

We can all leave together
from there.

If you say so.

Let's go, okay. Come on.

Straight people are weird.

So what happened
to Jeff's phone anyway?

I guess the dumbass
dropped it in the lake.

Quit it. Stop.

Quit it.

I just want to finish what
we started this morning.

-We could do it now.
-Come on.

What are you doing?

Are you nuts, bitch?
Get your hands off our stuff.

Blake!

My apologies, boys.

I thought they'd
snatched you up already.

Got to clean the place up,
you know.

-Lee?
-It's okay.

You're making this way too
easy for him, you know.

Well, we can't all be
as tough as you.

Besides, it's not like I have a
line of guys trying to get with me.

He's not that bad. I mean,
that one Valentine's Day

when I didn't have a date,
he got me a teddy bear.

I just... Why not give him
another shot? He's not...

Yeah, but it's Alex.

I know, I know, but I'm not going
to let him treat me like shit.

I don't deserve it, and I'm just not
going to let him get away with it.

Besides, I know
this is a big shock to you,

but I like sex, and it's been
a really long time.

Besides, he's not that bad.

Is he supposed to be here?

I guess, I don't know.

Really? Son of a bitch.

I bet you
he is back at the hotel,

and you're off wandering around
following him like a little puppy.

-He wouldn't do that to us.
-Yes, he would, he's Alex.

Yeah, I know. He said
the back of the church, right?

-Yeah, well, he lied.
-Maybe there's another church.

A church in a town
of six people!

I don't know,
I don't live here. Alex?

Alex!

Alex!

Afternoon, sisters.

Hi! I...

I don't want to bother you, but
we're looking for a friend of ours.

He was supposed
to meet us here.

No bother at all.
Maybe I can help you find him.

I mean, is he here?
Is he inside, maybe?

Probably easier
if I just showed you.

Run! Run!

Lorri!

Lorri! Lorri! Lorri! Lorri!

Lorri! Lorri!

No!
Hold on.

Lorri!

"And thou shalt kill
the bullock before the Lord,

"by the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation.

"And he took the blood, and sprinkled
it on the people and said,

"'Behold, the blood of the covenant
which the Lord hath made with you.'"

These are lean times,
brothers.

This one will serve us well.

Bring them both.

You see, little sister, we must
be prepared in times like these.

We would be remiss in our faith if
we were to pass up such a bounty

when the Lord has laid it
at our doorstep.

"A righteous man cares
for the needs of his flock.

"We care for our flock.

"We watch over it willingly,
not grudgingly.

"Not for what we will
receive, but because..."

"But because we are eager
to serve our Lord."

No, no, no, don't you worry.

Don't you worry.

I have no intentions on
you suffering such a fate.

But we must make thee
ready to serve the flock.

-These the last two?
-Yes, sir. A couple of queers.

This one, too?
Yes, Daddy.

Such a polite young man, too.

I say we take them outside, set
a fire, and be done with it.

Quiet, boy.

We can't feed them
to our flock.

Meat that touches anything
unclean must not be eaten,

it must be burned up.

Do not preach to me, boy!

You forget your place.

Brother Simon, do you think
these two might be saved?

That I do not know, brother.

I mean, can they truly
be cleansed of their sin?

How can you think about
letting them live?

We cannot let them pollute our
town, our land, our people.

Like a muddied spring
or a polluted well

are the righteous
who give way to the wicked.

I want you to try, brother.

This is not the time or the place
to have this conversation.

This is exactly the place
to have this conversation.

It's because of what
you're about to do!

I'm not sure you understand the
predicament you're in here, son.

Now, if you can repent,

if you can show us a sign
that you can live here...

It's the only way?

I'm afraid so, son.

You haven't seen how beautiful
things are here.

You could be truly happy.

After a while, a wife,
maybe some children.

It's the only way.
You have to see the light.

What the fuck are you doing?

Maybe they're right.

Maybe my grandfather
was right.

What kind of life can we have?

It's not like
we can get married.

And kids?

What do we have?

Pets?

It's not any kind of life.

Not really.

Are you sure, son?
You have to be sure.

Blake!

Please.

How can you do this to me?

How can you do this to us?

Because I'm tired!

I'm tired, Lee.

I'm tired of always
being the joke,

and the outcast.

And I don't want to have to
look over my shoulder

every time
I want to touch you,

-or kiss you...
-Stop. Please stop.

...or love you.

You have to
say it aloud.

Admit your sin.

That's the only way
you can seek forgiveness.

I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

I think I always knew
it was wrong.

You know what
has to be done, brother.

I do.

I am so sorry.

I love you.

You just killed yourself, boy!
Brahm! Isaac!

Shut the fuck up!

You self-righteous
piece of shit.

Didn't think you were gonna get
rid of me that easy, did you?

Let's get the fuck
out of here.

Simon! Simon!

I told you!

-They're gone.
-Well, that's apparent, boy.

-They're gone!
-Yes, they are.

You take care of that one,
I'll go tell his mother.

I'm sorry, Bud.

The Lord is with you. Just go.
Just go.

How many people have died
because we've listened to you?

We've spilt our blood.

It's on your head.

Watch your tongue, boy!

It's on your head!

You had to try to save
those unrepentant sinners.

You knew,
you knew I was right,

but you wouldn't let me
lay down His judgment.

"When you do wrong, be afraid.

"For he does not
bear the sword in vain.

"For he is a servant of the Lord,
an avenger for His wrath."

Men, take him to the church
and gather the congregation.

I'll be along shortly.

How dare you?
Get your hands off of me!

Let me go! Stop!

Shit!

-What do we do now?
-We run, and we don't stop.

Now.

There are those
destined and determined

to walk straight
into the grinder,

<i>and they cannot be saved.</i>

The ovens are hot, and they are
waiting for them, brethren.

We do not mourn them.
We do not shed a single tear.

Do we cry for the wheat that
puts our bread on the table?

<i>No, friends.</i>

They are meant to be fodder
for His true disciples.

We have been led astray. We have
been led astray by a false prophet.

Now I, out of any of us,

feel this betrayal to the
depths of my very living soul.

Each one of you have
faithfully obeyed the voice,

but, you see,
a man is justified by works,

and not by faith alone.

Please, please, brethren,
be seated!

We are being tested, brethren.

We have to return to the true
path, and this is the way.

Trust in the body and blood and
forever eat at the table of our Lord.

Deny it, and be cast down
with the curs and rats.

They are not worthy to eat but the
scraps and bones tossed unto the dirt.

Remember, friends,
it is not me

that is calling out to you
to pick up the sword.

It is He Himself
that commands you.

We're being tested!

If I am wrong,
let Him stay my hand.

If I am wrong,
let Him strike me down!

I welcome
His righteous retribution.

There is no other way but His,

and there is
no other truth but His.

We offer up this sacrifice,

and hope that once again

He may rain
His blessings down upon us.

Damn it!

Lee!

I said don't stop.
We have to get out of here.

No, look.

Shit! The keys!

"Dumb idea to have
a spare under the car,"

"Somebody will just
steal it,"

You were so right. Now will
you unlock my goddamn door

so we can get out of here,
please?

Hurry!
