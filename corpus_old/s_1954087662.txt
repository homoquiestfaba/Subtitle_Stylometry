It is...
Oh... Yeah.

It's gone?
Uh...

Listen, about that...

Thank you. I have...
You lie.

Well are you ready?

Of course, yes.

Sorry.
OK. This is good.

Nine hundred and sixteen days.

I Filoche.

Oona, I'm sorry.

This is really great.

All is well. I...
'm Very happy for you both.

You see, that's why
I wanted to come here.

This is the situation that I wanted...
But it will not. Really.

I usually, you know.

This is great.

Nine hundred sixteen days
it's almost...

Two and a half years.

Two and a half years.

I have finished my studies, I am
doctor.

Fingers crossed.

[This is the perfect time, in fact.

It's still crazy
to say it is outside.

She wanders,
she built her life.

And his little clock that was not lit
years

finally started counting.

You know...

Two years is a long time. So maybe
that both could...

I understand.

This is a mined relationship.

Pathetic.

Undermined .
This is the word I used.

And I told shabby.

This is more appropriate.

Sorry. That's great, I...

I really... Congratulations!

This is great. Super.
I gotta get back to work.

Listen, I was thinking...
Yes, well then, we...

It was great between us, really.
It's true.

You're great. Really...

This is cute. Not. I'm going.

Take care of yourself.

It's over. Everything you always wanted
is in this box.

See you soon, Oona!

This is one of our regular clients.

Good day, sir.
And keep good timing.

If a clock could tell you the exact moment

Where you meet your soul mate

would you know?

Here is the question that is asked by
a brand new device called

Timer.

Last technological revolution for meetings

Timer shows you the exact time
the person in your life...

We discovered that all human beings are
for a person.

Set just after puberty
and powered by body heat,

Timer allows you to calculate your rate
oxytocin, the hormone of love.

It falls to zero, the previous midnight.

And the next day it may sound
at any time

and there you meet your soul mate.

Tired of waiting for the love in your corner?

These long days are finally behind you.

Say goodbye to cockroach and disappointments.

Time become your best ally.

And love will finally
to go.

With Timer

technology is at your service
to tell you who will be your soulmate

especially when you meet.

Timer.
Do not let random chance.

Take the cake, Monica.

More sugar!
My Timer will soon ring.

This is when?
Three years.

A computer planted in the arm?

No, no way.

I really know.

It'll branch?
It tries thee?

What? Not. I have one.

At first he was a virgin,
it made me a little nervous.

But she had one too.
Where it is.

Jane loves dogs. John also.

Stop calculate
is done for you.

All
our common interests are just the tip of the iceberg.

We
we speak of true love.

Shared values, needs
emotional, physical attraction.

As of 2005, it is estimated that half of
Americans

age of fourteen
or more will Timers.

A recent survey suggests a satisfaction rate of 99%

in people who already have a timer.

It's like a fairy tale.

I
seen from the other side of the room.

He â€‹â€‹looked at me and I knew right away.

Everyone is returned
and people started clapping.

For the fifteenth anniversary of the invention of Timer

we met one of those couples.

Eric and Tammi had their account
countdown ends there five years.

I was very skeptical about the timer.

I really did not think it was possible that a watch to tell me

like that. But in fact, it is not
how it works.

What do you say to people who do not believe
it work?

It does not tell you who to love.

It just confirms what you know.

What you already feel but

when you're ready...

This is a bonus.

It reassuring.

What?

Why are you whispering?

I whisper it.

<i> Where are you </i>

In a church.

Brian is not good.

<i> Shit! This is not true </i>

Call me when you've found your panties.

It works.

So?

Brian is not for me.

Hi Priscilla.

'On'our.

If I took off your rings
today is what it looks like to you?

'Of our' reason?

Uh... He still has a month
Dr. O'Leary.

It's just there for an adjustment.

Yes, but a month, it has more.

According to my sources, the school
again next week.

My little brother goes to school,
he is the spy.

It has everything to him that child.
It will be a misfortune to college.

Your rings live their last moments, small.

'Is' rop su'er!

You know that the single in the supermarket?

A little old, but funny.

Go, I'll do...

It brings its products to the fund

type four rolls of toilet paper,
frozen food, stuff like that.

The cashier looked purchases
and he asks:

"Well, you're alone?"

Then she blushed a little,

type
you decrypted me just seeing my shopping

and the guy said no, you're just ugly
.

I thought it would make you laugh a little.

Really?

In fact, I thought you'd understand
irony.

This is missed.
Well, I mean...

As you are super pretty...

Okay. It was fun.

Sincere It's great that I told you.

That you made $ 30.29.

Sorry.

Try again.

Give it to me. Thank you.

I see your timer is blank.

So what?
No, nothing.

You wait until it comes on, huh?

This is a pity. If you know how to do it,
this can be very exciting.

I will try to remember.

Mickey.

Good evening.

For soon.

Goodbye.
Take care of yourself.

Oh, that's out of the question.
No. Put it.

Does it have a timer?

Yeah, of course.
I'm not stupid.

Guys What Timer not arise too

While those who have a

They want to regret anything at all.

They are using you.

And I am using them. All is well.

I do not know...

It is scientifically proven that

these guys will make you suffer
and yet you continue to hang out with.

It can not be
as great as you claim.

You're right. The bestial sex, furious orgasmic
and is super annoying.

I think you should get a cat.

Oona.

On a scale of 1 to 10,
it makes you what, shot Brian?

6.

6.5. But you know,

okay, it's not even for Brian.

I just want to find the right one.
Do you understand?

Even though I know I not know him before...

What? Your forty?

Yes, Mom. I'm sorry.
We start in the second, I promise.

Hi! Sorry for the delay.
We are here!

It's his fault!

Good evening.

Hola.

She has not changed a bit, your mother?

You are!

Hey!

Oh, dear!
Hi mom.

Hi, Steph.

Girls! This is my wife
household, Luz.

Luz, this is my daughter, Oona
and the daughter of Paul, Steph.

Mucho gusto.

Good evening, Luz!

Thank you for your excellent work.

Buenas noches.

Not a word of French.

This is so exciting!
Do not you?

Where is Brian?

It was not good.

Honey. I'm sorry.

Why did you bring today?
You have time.

Because you said that we would
a double celebration.

Brian was not made for you.
We already knew.

Well said, Marion. Amen!

Steph, honey.
Do not force me to interfere in your life.

I apologize.

Oona. Thank you to keep
head high, it is very nice.

We have to wait for the next
try, right?

Now the programmer Ron
is in the living room for an hour!

Jesse!
Yeah?

Excellent.
Everyone in the room, quick!

Hi. So, are you excited?

Oona, do not do your heavy.
What? I'm happy for him.

Jesse Aaron Depaul, you
the legal age to use the timer.

This is to say, the first month of your entry
in high school, my boy.

Are you ready, my darling?

Fingers in the nose, Jess.

Do not worry. You might get more teeth
before

you find one that will beep.

Or that!

I'm not gay, Mom.
Are we could finish?

Jess.

I will create a set dentures,
if necessary.

But know that whatever happens,

'll Find someone out there who will love you
much as we love you.

Deep breath, dear.

Only three days?

What a bastard!

Excuse me.

Three days, Paul.

I admit that it is unusually fast
, but...

It's better than nothing, right?
Tell that to my sister.

Moron.

It finally has
chances of having grandchildren!

Less strong,
my ovaries hear you!

Upon entering high school!
That's my boy!

Oona.

You know what.
I'll go, I think.

Oona, you must find it
so unfair.

She told me to Brian.

That's nice, Paul. It's okay, Mom.

No! You emmÃ¨neras me nowhere.
You stay here.

I want to sleep tonight.

Congratulations.

Bye bye.

This is not true.

At what time you finish?

What?

You really want me to repeat?

Yeah, into the microphone,
if you do not mind.

Believe me when I say that
it'll be your only chance.

So answer me quickly.

Now. I just finished.

Nelson!
Be nice, take my place.

You're sucks, dude.

So, what are you doing?

Orthodontist.

This is a kind of dentist?

This is it.

I'm just orthodontist.

Sounds cool.

What's your name?

Uh... In fact, I have roommates.

How?

Four.
But they came out, normally.

Guys, and your manners?

Oona I present to you all.

And this is TJ Zuckerman, the weakling

on the chair,
is Greggy, and it is Wretch.

Uma like Uma Thurman?

That's right, yes.
Wretch, is not it?

We go to my room, it is
around the corner there. Just after.

I beg you. What?

Who is this chick?

Is that you could avoid
to tell me your age?

It would suit me.

OK.

How old are you, you?

I'll be thirty in January.

This might be a bad idea.

No! This is a great idea.
There is this kind of...

Uncontrolled attraction
raw desire,...

Everything that you want, it's really...

Really a great idea,
I swear.

You've got four months.

Yeah, but then you see...

This is four... many months.

Enjoy your time well.

What?

Yes, I'll just... Agree?

No, no. Rest.
No, I have...

Really. Hello.
No, but... Come back, please.

It is... Kiss sup...

Who are you?

I'm him.

You know what they say:
Everything comes to...

<i> All residents. The raffle... </i>

I'm fine.
I said nothing!

Margaret? It's you, Margaret?

Still missed, Sadie.

Oh, forgive me.

So? How do you feel?

I'm fine, I tell you.

Mom got me an appointment for tomorrow
evening.

The little son of someone.

Your mother is a real steamroller.

Margaret!
Answer your mother, Margaret.

I'm still your girl!
It returns?

Forgive me.
Okay.

I too undermined Jesse?

<i> No! Good old Ron </i>
<i> is responsible for you </i>

Romeo and Juliet were fourteen when they are loved.

You just remembered a guy
camp theater.

Margaret. It's you, Margaret?

Wait.

Yeah that's me, Mom.

And I have something to tell you.

I'm gay.

You're...
Gay!

Gay to your fingertips.

dyke to death.
In addition, my girlfriend...

This is a black.

It is not funny.

J'te recalls.

Well... if it was funny.
Miss Depaul.

You still think you have eternity before you
,

but it will soon be your turn to be in his place.

Come, dear lady.

Your room is there.

In the army, we had a nickname
for such individuals.

You little asshole?
Big pine oyster.

Yours is better that going?

The severity lengthens.
Look rather in the air, honey.

Welcome, Mr. Evers.

First visit.

A little freshness.

Tell me, how did you find us
...

There are not many orthodontists who
your name.

You'll think to thank my father. Cindy
you can give us a moment?

In addition, Cindy.

I think I need rings.

But it's not me an expert, so take a look
.

This is... Look, I...

Come on, do not you think I'm cute in
bib?

You can not stay, OK?
That's my job here, you can not...

Look, I'm sorry.

I did not want to freak you, it was just...

I think you're really cool and...

We should go out together.

Mickey, I...

I'm just a cashier.

No! That's not why.
Good.

I am a musician.
And I really love my job.

The problem is my timer?

Yes, it is.

Do you think I'm wrong someone
I have ever met.

No, I just think that if your
countdown is launched

if you have the chance to wait for your real great...

Love. Say, I'm not mock.

This is it. You know it exists, then wait for the
.

This is what sucks with Timer

you have more than one way to go and you do not
turns.

But life is full of detours.

Do you hear what you're saying?
Looks like you sell shoes.

I expect great love.
And you're not the man.

Got it.

This is supposed to beep or flash.

Bipper and flash.

And why you've never installed
Timer?

Love has never been a priority for me
.

Are you sure it works?

It was as magical as in your dreams?

I guess there is not always
chemistry the first time.

Feelings can be installed later.

This is clear!
The passion that never lasts,

so much
find a guy who has nothing to say to you.

Thank you.

Swallow it. I'll be right there.

It is the Truckbeef.
Thank you for coming.

This is our last song.
It is called:

Mom, call me.
I do not know what to do with the body.

Close the door.
What?

Close the door.
Oh, yeah.

Do not worry, others are
the bar for a moment.

They flirt groupies.

I think it's cute that you play together.

When I was little,
the Bangles had separated.

I imagined in their loft

train ride their sleeping bags

store their makeup...

I like you too!

And leave their apartment where they have known

a fantastic time.

Who were these guys?

I can be very wild.
I love it.

No, no! It is silk.

I'll do it.

Too bad. Let's be crazy.

Go.

Hey, Mikey!

Oh yes, Mikey, come on!
I gotta go to the bathroom!

I hate my friends!

They can not live without me?

Wait. Well, uh...

Eat cereals,
I'll be right back.

This was our worst gig.

Frankly, it was lame.

You'll shut your mouths!

Listen. I am very serious.

This girl here...

It not play at all in my class
and I do not even know how

I brought here.

Petite chick.

If I'm a chick, so I'm going to
the lesbian relationship

most exciting of my life!

So I'm asking you to
not all fuck me in the air.

Hi.

Hi.

Samuel? It is you, Samuel?

Uh... Not.

Samuel
your children do not come to much.

And Margaret is impossible!

I think you take me for someone else
.

I miss you a lot.

I do not sleep
when you're not in our bed.

Uh... Neither do I.

Sadie, I'm willing to bet that it
is not Margaret.

Sorry,
our youth are a little unruly.

Can I help you?

Uh... I just see Dutch Solomon.

Oh, it must surely snooze.

So?
You have what region?

Rhodes Island.

I work at the university.

I love how you say it.
As if there was only one in town.

Vire your legs my little son.

You do not want me to get married, Grandpa?

He â€‹â€‹came to support his grandfather,

not to dredge the maid.

He does what he wants his day.

What's your first name?
Uh, Dan.

Superdan . Me is Steph.

Enchanted, Steph.

No Timer. Damage.

My angel, had it been for you,
I would have told you.

I know your kind of man.

Come on, Daniel. This game of scrabble
will not be alone.

I'm glad to have known her.
The feeling is mutual.

Ah, you're awake.

Dirty junk.

So, you tell me
what you did last night?

Oh, my god!

Tell me what you did or
I piss you in your bed!

I met a guy.

Timer?

How long?

Three months. And wheelbarrows.

Too Sexy!

More D-Day approaches

and they want
to you like beasts.

It was great. It was more than that,

It was more than that, it was too
incredibly giant!

If you knew, as he kisses...

Uh... I do not know.
And he has great hands!

I am very proud of you.

Seriously, Oona.
You're finally exploded for real.

I told you, the one-night,
there is never better.

I do not know if I'll put it away in the workbook
"no tomorrow."

You do not intend to review
this guy, right?

Oona?

Even if it does nothing dramatic
your Timers are not in phase,

it has no intention of replaying this scene with you
. It will remind you more.

But! You took your foot.
Right?

Yes, it was really great.

Super... You want pancakes
shaped cat?

You've seen me refuse
pancakes shaped cat?

Ten.
Ten.

Nine.
Nine.

Eight.
Eight.

One - One

Midnight!

The next time you hear the sound
is when you will meet

the look of your wife.

But it sound louder.

I, it had freaked me out.
So be ready.

I can get into my room?
Are you kidding?

How do you want to sleep?

It's more exciting than Christmas Eve!

At any time
in the next twenty-four hours

You will meet that girl
you will spend the rest of your entire life!

Yeah.

<i> Tremble for you. Steph </i>

<i> With his large hands, heated </i>
<i> teacup Madeleine, </i>

<i> Mowgli clasped her hips. </i>

<i> His shyness vanished </i>

<i> "Mowgli, missionary work </i>
<i> is much harder than I imagined . "</i>

<i> She soon discovered </i>
<i> that was not it hard... </i>

Thanks! No crap.

Oona? How did you get Guy?

It's nice.

But that's about it.

You have to wait to do it install a timer.

Go to the end of things, darling.

Yes, Mom.

Girls,
you do not realize how lucky you.

Your generation will never know
carnage of divorce.

The sentences heart inconsolable.

The discomfort when
feelings are not reciprocated.

The humiliations. And I'm not talking about
possible venereal diseases

caused by occasional intimacies.

It was a living hell before.

A real butcher.

We had a crazy chance

despite the death of your mother, Steph,
and my disastrous marriage.

Paul and I found ourselves.

Now
we have a perfect family.

Perfect.
Perfecto.

And you are not thrilled to be
become sisters, both?

-
Si - Si

And we all need to Timer.

Jesse!

Jesse! That's it?

I must go.
Hi. See you tomorrow.

Super Marion.

Now, you're just removing him
chocolate on her cheek with your saliva.

This is not it.

So what?

Is it a paged?

No.

What does it hurt to invite girls
Sheila to eat pizza?

Cool, dinner
forced and arranged marriages.

This is not your role to act as matchmaker
.

Luz! You're leaving?

If Madame Marion, me voy.

Hey, Eduardo.

Oh, it's your daughter?

Si Es mi hija.

Soledad ! Por favor.

The Saluda.

Hello Ms. Depaul. I Soledad.
Nice to meet you.

What beautiful daughter, Luz.

This is my daughter, Oona.
My daughter, Steph.

And here Jesse.

Slim, then!

Eduardo!

This is just fantastic!

Is it not fantastic, Jesse?

Is!

Hi.

What paso?

Sono la cosa.

Con el?
Ya el sound Timer.

Esta luz segura that...
Y la luz parpadea.

Mom, why not invite them to join
a drink?

Great idea! Please.

Dice that tenemos una sanilla in the Mostar.

Sorry, Ms. Depaul
but we have a dinner.

But you dine with us!

. No, this is a
dinner in my honor.

With the neighborhood boys.

Well, it is no longer useful,
must say.

Sorry, but we have to go.
Thanks.

This is not what I call
of politeness.

That's family.

They are in shock.

And so are we, Mom.
You can not blame them.

My darling.
It looks really nice.

And super great.

Marion.

Leave him a little.

This is a little hard for him,
mom, you know.

He has not a hair on his chin and
he was presented with the woman of his life.

He has no idea of â€‹â€‹what
love.

You know, do you?

And here.

On some subjects,

best placed to talk about it.

I love when she leaves her little claws.

Say, do not you think it odd that is never

fell in love?

No.

It happens once, then
is good.

Yes. But, do you think they thought
like this before?

What it does happen once.
Finally, before the timer?

I think the expression

"true love"
necessarily imply that there is smaller.

Here you will not address
to the right person.

Thanks for the help.

Good night, Cindy.
Good night.

You bastard!

Wanna blow up my nose, or what?

Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

I just wanted to see you.

Why?

You're a real denture adhesive.

Just give me a minute.

She's out.
Uh, who?

My sister Steph.
We live together.

And you not like?

Oh yes, yes. It is very girlfriends.

This is it?

Oh, you're twins?

No. In fact, it is my half-sister

but still our birthday party together.

Every year, mom
organizes a surprise party.

This is a surprise for you
every year?

Oh, I like.

Nice.

Okay, I see. Say, uh...

How long will it last?

As long as you let me kiss you.

Look, I...

I have not used.
I slept with four men in my life

and each time, I was afraid

to face the possibility of losing.

And with you, it is
that is not even a possibility.

This is absolutely sure.

So, you're a free spirit.

Wait a second. You say I'm your
"Mambo number five?"

You want to dance?

Yes...

Yes?
Yes.

Yes?

Yes!
Yes?

Kiss me.

It's gone.
OK.

My mother had her own
when she was still married to my father.

This became irrefutable proof
they were divorced.

You can still see your father?

Not since my childhood.

This is a music producer and good...

Had not much in common.

Wait. You're kidding me?

Your father is Rick O'Leary?

Yes.

Is that okay?

You're kidding! It is a legend!

This is what I was told.

I slept with the girl
Rick O'Leary.

I'm too cool as dude.

I could have sworn that you had that defect.

Vilaine!

Your parents are together?

Yeah.
They met the old.

They had four beautiful boys with me
the youngest and most beautiful.

Your brothers have timers or not?

Why do you want a date?

A girl, it should look, it can not just

bathing
and cry over the fate of the Timer.

You do not have to thy sister,
you're lucky.

Yes, you're right.

But, in a sense know

is always better than not knowing. Although

knowledge can be terribly confusing.
At least she lives her life.

It can build its future.
Make big plans.

This is how she lives?

No.

No. It takes a little mystery in life
.

Really?

If this is your philosophy,
why you have a timer?

This was to be like the others.

Why are you on the other side of the bed?

I do not know.

I see why you do not know.
You idiot.

You're the idiot.
You're an idiot.

No, it's you.
Idiot.

You, idiot.
Shut up.

You farm.
Shut up.

Miss Depaul.
Where were you there an hour?

Right there. Faithful to the post.
A smile on my face.

Why
Ms. Kauffman fell on the answering machine three times?

You trust a nasty reporter?

You're not paid to walk
,

but to sit behind the counter.

Sorry to interrupt.
But it's my fault.

When I arrived this morning

I forgot where
room of my grandfather and was

I asked him to accompany me.

Really?

Yes.
Who is your grandfather?

Dutch Solomon.

<i> Doctor Rosen, contact the lab </i>.

Apologize.

You did not have.

I apologize.

I wanted to avoid unnecessary remonstrances.

This was totally unnecessary.

I spent an hour sipping
frapuccino a local bar.

OK, so I remember?

If you want, we told him the truth.
It will do me good.

No, I do not want to have
a good influence on you.

Do you know
Pocket Watch?

You go to the bar tonight?

Uh... Why not.

I do not know, why?

Because it's been a while you're at
not go.

And because I found you a new little toy
without timer.

White teeth.
Exceptionally naive.

No scars and no visible tattoos.

Uh...  Okay. Okay, okay, I...

I'll jump.

What?

Why are you weird?
It is you who are weird!

Technical Jolie.

Yeah. Nice Suit, James Bond.

Dutch insisted.

This is always a good idea

take fashion advice
an octogenarian.

What are you drinking?

I'm afraid to order now.

I promise not to laugh at you.

Bring me what you want.

My sister will go in a minute. Is it good?

No problem.

Oona.
You have perfect teeth.

I know.
You...

Femur very very white.

And your tricomachin
is simply superb.

Should aspire.

Oh. Aspiration.
Go ahead.

OK, now...
Oops, sorry. I think

I sucked you a tonsil.
I am going to place.

No response.

She better be
crushed under a truck.

This was an appointment?

Your sister has a blank timer.

Nothing can hide you, James.

In any case, that's nice. Thank you.

I'm sure your sister is nice,
but I'm not looking

of anything.

How can want nothing at all?

I was married.

And my wife is dead. So...

Sorry.

No, no, wait. That's why I
tell anyone.

You're the girl most impertinent
I met.

And then you just be nice
and condescending with me.

In fact, You wanna forget.

What?

I'm sorry. I have not...

It's okay, it's okay.
No it would kill me there.

This is not... In your place,
I would not know what to say either.

So, it's been how long?

Three years already. In December.

How was it?

She was very beautiful.

But quite disturbed.

It is as if waiting for something bad from happening
, permanently.

And he finally arrived.

This was your great love?

Yes, she was.

You knew without Timer?
Obviously.

Yes, I see it.

Was even more!

Excellent evening.

I love this job.

You can see it, yes.

And there's something else
that interest you?

Apart serve and answer the phone?

Why do anything else?

Oh. But that's how it works
here, right? Waitresses

are actresses.
The guys who are writers deliver you...

Good. The naked truth:

I work in a bar
order to meet guys

and I take care of the old
because they have no timer.

I bet you do it
for something else.

Yeah, I like to pass...
No, listen,

do not answer,
if your answer is not sincere.

Standing, wimp!

Who raised you?

When we say we do
something, we do it!

What there was, Steph?
Damn!

This is not so dramatic.

Oh if it's a drama!
You just missed a rather attractive man,

terribly nice, with a big heart
bleeding like that

and desperately seeking true love.

A bit like you, Tartouille!

You're naked?
Me? No!

I have a robe.

But you're naked underneath.
You never sleep naked.

Sometimes it happens.
No! Never.

You're too scared to try burglars.

Who's there?
No!

There is no one!

Since when did you lie to me?

I'm Mikey. You is Steph?

You not tired. Uh...

This gentleman is three months
right?

Yes . One month and twelve days,
yes, it's him.

Oona. What are you doing?

You were together all this time?
Yes! Indeed.

And everything goes well.
I control the situation.

Thou controls?
If I...

You thickets finger in the eye, my old
.

Why? Because I'm happy
spending quality time with him?

Because I'm not a real slave
Timer?

No! But because it will break your heart in the
billion pieces!

I think...
I know all about self-destruction

and it is!
I think...

Maybe we could...
Spit your piece, Sparky!

Mikey.
What's the difference?

My Timer.

What did he?

Oh my god!

Girls, calm.
What's up, it's a fake.

Look, it sticks.

This is a fake?

You...  You have no countdown?

You got no timer at all?

No, I have not.

Are you kidding me?
No wait, I'll explain.

I beg you. Explains.
Yeah, okay, uh...

Wretch found it on the internet,
someday.

You program the date you want.
And everyone was obsessed with this stuff,

so I bought here...
I had more pressure not have.

If I dig it, you use it as a false alliance
pick up girls.

This is smart enough, I admit. Sorry.

No. I mean yes,
they sell for.

But I just wanted a chance
whether the person like me

and if it is reciprocal.

It is you who have said.
You're different with guys without Timer.

But do not want you to know that
for real?

Yes, but now I know you're lying
me for months.

I did not want to meet you like this.

You mean underpants?

With this timer.

Here. Thank you.

Nice knowing you.

You want to make another break?

No.
I want you to leave my house.

Okay. Super.

If you understand that you make a mistake,

the fact that I do not have
Timer is a good thing,

call me.

Hi.

'Read.

I have no reason to apologize, but
I apologize.

This is an excuse just forced it.

This is true.

It is you who should apologize.

I know.

I should have told you.

You should have, indeed.

This is what I just said.

I know.

You came to me to destroy the moral?
No.

I thought maybe we could
out a little more.

From Monday, obviously.

It depends, actually.

What?

What you got this weekend?

Thanksgiving.

Ah, that's true.

You do not have a project?

Good. Then.

My mother is a little crazy.
But absolutely adorable.

My stepfather Paul himself is
much more sane.

This is it you speak.

Got a tire-swing!

Oh! My brother Jesse.
A golden boy.

And his soul mate and his family will be there
.

It is very stressed,
therefore not angry.

And you already know Steph.
So you know if it shows teeth

hide yourself under the table. Ready?

Hi!

Do not move. Sorry.

J'te this mother.
Marion Depaul.

This is my stepfather, Paul.

You know my sister, Steph.

And here's Jesse, Soledad
and Mr. and Mrs. Morales.

Good evening. Mikey.

Oh, sorry. Sorry.

I present Michael Evers.

Well, we are delighted to welcome you
.

Paul is to mix the guacamole.

It looks delicious.
Great.

I think
qu'Oona had to announce the good news.

Soledad will be part of the family.

Oh yes, I learned it. Congratulations
. Felicidades.

Gracias.

Uh... Margarita, Mikey?

Your identity card, Sparky.

If you allow me, I'll stick to water, but
thank you sir.

What a joy to see you, Steph.

Me, I will. Thank you.

I propose a toast.

To our families who make more than one.

Health.

So Oona. You did not tell me much about Michael
.

How did you meet?
Thank you.

Mikey musician.
I met him at a concert.

You play what instrument?
Is the drummer.

His band was a huge success.

What's his name your band again?

Truckbeef.

Large dung?

Truckbeef!

You know?

I know that "love is a beautiful mess."

This is your first single,
is not it?

Yeah. While there, you amaze me.

Tell me, Michael.
Where are you from?

Excuse me.

Kalamazoo, Michigan. For real.

Is that why
you do not have a timer?

Indeed.
And also because I do not believe it.

Quieres a burrito, Mikey?

Oh, yes. Por supuesto.

It went well.
It went well, eh?

I think it went well.
It went well. Okay?

Sure, why?

You look a little tense air
that's all.

All is well.

This is supposed to beep or flash?

Both.

Does
you can remember why you've never had a timer?

I do not know.
I have not had the opportunity.

Really?

At the time, I still lived in Michigan
. And ..

There are eight, when I was old enough to make me
install,

it was still scary. People were afraid.
Then all my high school had one.

And I did not want to
as everyone.

You're twenty-two years?

Yeah. You thought I had more?

Yes. More frankly, yes.

Is it a paged?

No.

This is a charming young man.

Mom.

What harm is there in that?

It is as if you had seen
a movie you hate,

and thou know why

you've learned all the dialogues
worst scenes by heart.

Why
do not tell me what you really think?

It is too young

there is no culture,
it is not good enough.

I feel that it is you who speak there.

The only thing that worries me
is that you're so attached to the boy.

It is you who say we go
to the bottom of things.

I would be delighted if it had a timer.

If it was good,
I would love for you.

But even if it had a timer,
I would still have doubts.

It reminds me of your father too.

What it looks like him?

This is a musician!

This may be a bit redundant, but it
the same haunting charm a bit.

This species aside a little bohemian.

I admit that it is very attractive.

What kind of mother would I be if I
does not help you

to avoid the mistakes I made?

If my father is a mistake, so can I. I am a
, is not it?

Oona. No prank.

I know everything
you have done for me.

But you can not say that Paul
is your soulmate

and I'm the girl of your dreams
in the same sentence.

These are two different lives.

I must go.

I thought you had dinner with us?
No, Mikey and I are going out tonight.

Can I ask you something?

Can I say no?

No.

Why there tits
that go into a spin?

I'm not sure I understand.

OK. Thy breasts to you,
they are straight, strong, sublime.

But I'm talking about girls who have breasts
that deviate a little from the center.

This is strange.

As a guy who squints,
we do not know what eye look.

Unless they are super far.
There, you think they are normal,

but if you bifton a troubled,

they arrive in your eyes
and is like, "which I have to watch?"

Sometimes I tell myself that it's girls
sleeping too much on the belly.

So, it departs.

Or it may be genetic.

The cow, if it is genetic,

Girls have their breasts
squarely in the back.

Eh. I have something for you.

These are our new songs.

Y is one that is called.
"You m'fais cringe."

Original.
Thank you.

So when I see you again?

Or to be precise, when I see him again
your pretty little firmer breasts?

I do not know.
Maybe when you get matured.

There is a problem?

Mikey.

I'll be thirty,
this weekend.

This is your biological clock
running?

This is what we do!
This is... I mean...

I do not have time for this kind of
relationship without a future.

Thank you for everything, making
pretend that the timer had not.

Really, it was great.
I have had a good time.

But now
I know that your wrist is blank

I can not stop thinking about it.
It haunts me completely!

My virgin wrist? Damn, what are you talking about
? What is your problem?

This is why I do not want a timer,
it fucks up.

I need to know.
I'm really tired of waiting.

Okay. Okay.

If I had a timer,

and that he would have to pass
paged our life together

it will suffice?

Yes.

So, you're more confident
a plastic than what I'm saying?

You say nothing, you
pissing me off!

If I say
I'm in love with you!

I do not know what it means.

Listen, Oona.

What are you waiting for?

A warranty.

No.

Your problem is not my warranty,
it's yours.

Forget it.

I have something to do.

Species of pretentious.
I need to go see Rick.

Golly!

Uh... I ended up in twenty minutes.

And shit, it breaks. Come on.

Well, it changes the studio
where you've grown.

That yes.

I slept on an ironing board,
hanging from the ceiling.

You think he'll recognize me?

Breasts were growing, we change
no brainer.

It is the stroke of the bell,
to laugh?

You took a bag with a turd?

Hello!

Hello...

We came to see Rick.

This is for what?

Oh, no, no.

No, it's not what you think.

No. I... Finally, I'm his daughter.

Rick?

These girls want to see you.

Hi.

Where is your bathroom?

Follow me. Forgiveness.

Sorry for not calling
before moving on.

This is not serious.
Uh, come on, sit down.

How are you?

Okay.

It is you seem very moved
but I have a friend...

I do not know if he has talent, but
play in a small group.

And I say you could
perhaps listen to some demo's.

Okay.

I will.

Well, you know what?

I do not want to waste your time

I just wanted you to explain...

You
tell me why you never had Timer.

I know it is not so much an artist
sensitive stuff

and all that, but...
I have one, Timer.

What?

When do
you did install?

Before you and your mother
leave home.

I thought you had refused.
No.

This was my idea.

I knew that there was no
future, even before you were born.

But Marion did not want to know.

I told myself that if we had Timers,

then it might open your eyes a little
.

When did your count?

It is white as snow.

Can you imagine?

Apparently
life holds for me a surprise.

Let's go.

Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

I did retire.

Your father is not my soul mate.

But I love it.

The devil. Who cares.

Here we go! We could have done that
there for years!

This is more exciting than the day

where
convinced Katie Meyers to shave his head.

Oh, yes.
Oona?

It was a sacred moment.

You will definitely leave nothing to chance.

No. Not.
She is my sister, Steph.

Nice to meet you.
The feeling is mutual.

We want to take our Timers.

For real?

Removed completely?
Yes.

Oona, you drop?

No.
She wants to take the lead.

Finally, we want to.

You transfer us these vampires,
yes or heck?

I do not know.
I have never done that before.

I'll call my boss.

You're certain you want to make this mistake?

Absolutely.
Downright!

Note that removing the
Timer is much more painful than the establishment.

This is one reason why
we do not recommend it.

And you will have a visible scar.

Okay, that's cool.
We are warriors.

This is a real antique, the Timer!
The cow is a relic!

He's too old!

Remarks can be avoided?
Thanks.

Sorry.

It's gone?

It's been years that I expect it.

Let's go.

I count to three.

One

Two.

Pu... nese!

I swear, it's not bad.

It shows.

You're clueless the three?

It's like losing ten pounds.

Good.

To you, champ.

Send your mother in hell!

Good!

Oona, do you realize

is irreversible when the device is removed.

Your sensory area is too damaged.

Why did they not tell me about it, me?

You can be more clear?

You can no longer do you implement
Timer.

The other wrist does not work.
You are entitled to a chance.

Just... OK.

Question.

You think my timer work?

Or that it is a sort of family curse
?

The fate, you know...
This is a bit overrated in my opinion.

Oona?

We're together.

Okay.

Go. Go. We go.
Are you sure?

Super.

Three.

One

Two.

What... What is it?

What happens?

This is crazy!

Can know what's crazy?

Apparently, your soulmate
just bought a timer.

The shit!
You will meet him tomorrow!

No! No, no. You must have the
bypass your thing.

This is bullshit!

I mean, it's impossible!

Even if this is true,
anyway, it changes nothing.

This is perhaps Mikey, and in this case,
you will see tomorrow, or else

it will be someone else, but
in all cases, you will meet tomorrow.

You'll still remove it, huh?

Oona? You gonna do it?

I do not know.

I know more.

It finally happened!

I'll wait for you outside.

You will not regret it.

By cons, it is 79 dollars
for your sister.

This is the price manipulation '.

Jesse. In your post. Good evening.

If you leave this chair, I promise

I'll make you listen to classical music
until you die.

Mikey! Enter soon!
The girls arrive in a minute.

And thank you for coming.
Thanks for inviting me, ma'am.

Hi.
Oh, hello.

I do not move from this chair.

Hi.
Good evening.

Dan.
Mike.

Nice, Mike.

You're family?

Uh, no. Just a friend.

Me too.

Mom, it's there.

Come on, everybody! Shh!
They are there, they are there!

Mikey! Hurry! Come on!

The lights!

Surprise!
Surprise!

Oona Where?

I do not know
it is not coming together.

Well, it does not matter.
Happy birthday, darling.

What?

You're... beautiful.

Cow!

This is not the reaction
I expected, but...

I want to crush them.

I beg you.
It's your birthday, after all.

Mi hija. Puritan Meyos if?

Lo tienes you well.

Hi.

<i> I hope someday you'll leave me </i>

<i> make you happy </i>

This is perfect, thank you.

Excuse me, Ms. Depaul.

Luz wants me to translate.

Wonderful.

No tenemos that ser amigas.

We are not friends.

I'm sorry.

No, that's not it, sorry.
I'm a little rusty.

In fact, she said that
you're not forced to be friends.

Okay.

Uberiasi lo mejor if
unos dos o tres aÃ±os

Jesse y Soledad uviren
passado a mess in secreto.

It would have been easier

if
Jesse and Soledad had begun to see themselves in secret.

If lo  Y
viso ubiaramos descuvierto irritando llorano.

And if we had discovered
and it would have enraged...

Andriamos Amory knew that acceptar

nuestras familias despues of that is casaran.

... and they have forced us to accept
their love and their families

after their marriage.

Oh, I would have preferred this version.

Yo tambien lo preferia?

Gracias.

Y por ahora, the Chinese yo Callara
y usted the dueÃ±a de la casa.

In the meantime, I'm your wife and you
cleaning my boss.

Good. Perfect. Excellent plan.
Do not you, Mikey?

Thank you, Luz.

Uh, are a good level.
Muy bien, Luz.

Gracias.

Gracias.

No, I think, look,
is more like it.

And uh, not that I know.

Oona!

Good evening.

Jesse! Steph! Paul!

J'voulais hear my name.

Please!
The queen of the party!

Oona, your Timer.

What? You have a timer?

Uh, yes.

Since when you
a countdown, honey?

Since yesterday evening.

Steph!

I think I
aggravated the situation by inviting Mikey.

I'm Marion.
Enchanted, Dan.

Paul.
Good evening. Dan.

Dan, what do you do?

Mikey!

Mikey!

Is it good?
Because it is more presentable.

Yes, but at the same time,

Theme of the evening is a bit
misfires stuff.

Okay?

Are you kidding?

No. We could talk about.

No, I do not want to talk about.

I began to appreciate our relationship.

I found my feelings
young schoolgirl frightened.

I did not want you to look at another
me.

Hi.

Good evening.

This is a fucking Greek tragedy here.

I'll go, it will be better.

No!

It is rather for me to leave.

You surely want to be a little lonely.

Steph, please. Talk to me.

OK.

I'll never forgive
have screwed up

the only romantic relationship of my entire career.

Nothing is...  screwed up.

You, I do not need your help.
You do not talk to him like that.

You'll yell at me and him thou engueuleras not?

It is he who has made a timer installed

at the worst time that can exist!

I had no idea
what would happen...

New. Given all the time
did you get started in my life

you could let me have
two minutes with my sister!

Will you stop being such a dirty slut?

Hey, you're
who are mean to me!

Because it makes me sick, OK!
And I have the right to be angry!

It seems a little unfair
that you have everything you want and I...

Do you realize?
Everyone we know had a countdown.

But  us, we had Timers
complete rubbish!

It was us against the world.

I'm not the world.

Now you are.

Can you give us a minute?
With joy.

You know...

I took this Timer
thanks to you, Steph.

Because I spent more time with you

and less
I want to be alone.

And there should be
a good side to all this,

is that I know you'll
part of my life forever.

"If there is a bright side to all this"...

Looks like you did
a wonderful first impression.

Who is it?

This is Dan.

Superdan.

You have a man in your life,
and you did not tell me anything, Steph?

If you had been a little less selfish
lately...

Okay.

Well then... That's what we'll do.

I'll go.

And you remains angry here.

And if you want, you can stay angry
all weekend

but Monday morning,
you come home.

You're the person I love most in the world.

You are my soul mate
from the beginning and you know it.

Love...

It's not worth it,
if you're not near me.

Hello.

Where are the others?

They have a concert in San Francisco.

You're not with them?

I had something planned for yesterday.

Fuck Timer.

Really,
I have nothing more to do now.

Should I walk
at sunset with a stranger

but that is not what I want!

No, you freaking out because you got what you wanted
.

No, this is not what I wanted!

Look!

I've taken!
It is clear, right?

And I know very well what you think
.

Whether it is useless

because I've found

I know who is supposed to be my soul mate
,

it's too late

that I can not go back,

I have done it for nothing.
Is that it?

This is what you think here?
Do not you?

Your sentence is too long,
I forgot the beginning.

But it's too late.

How can it be too late?
You do not even believe in the Timer!

I do not think its use,
but I think it works.

And even if it works, we do not know how long
he and I will...

In a year, we'll be together?

One year, it's been a while.

My answer is yes.

We'll be together,
I doubt it.

My answer is not
on the Timer.

I know.

This is because you're not in love with me
.

I was in love with you.

I think I was.

I think I blew it.

You think not?

Maybe.

You're awfully stoic.

I never heard that word,

But you broke my heart
and I'm trying to save the appearance there.

So, if you could leave me alone!

Shit!

Everything was so much simpler when you had your
false Timer.

Because you were not obliged to play
little couple?

No. Because I kept thinking
in the future, as you told me.

I was just with you
and I loved it.

Yeah, good.

I appreciate you're done you remove this thing.

There will be a trace?

A scar, yes.

You touched me.

In a good way?

Very good, yes.

I'm glad you in
hast nothing to do Timer.

Way, you'll make
a good opinion of him.

Love him.

It is 8:37 in the morning.

I thought you were dead.

Hello.

Hi.

They are weird, huh?

This is my team relay race.

I put them these masks.
This is something hunters in Bangladesh.

That way they avoid...
Yes. I know, I saw the story.

I know they wear their masks
in the back to scare the tigers.

Exactly.

Us, it is used to terrify
those who think they can follow us.

I see. Fun.

Fun, really?
Yes!

And you, what are you doing on my trail
?

This is my hunting ground.

From 7:00 to 8:00
a quarter.

Yes.
I have had a overslept.

I apologize for being so mean.

Okay. I understand.

Do not take it personally.

This is nothing. All is well.

I'm glad you're okay.
When mine became virgin

I thought you were taking a bus you.

I'm fine.

I'll go back to my team.

Yes. Okay.

Try to be late more often
.

Ciao.
