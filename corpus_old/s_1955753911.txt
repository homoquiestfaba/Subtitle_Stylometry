and calling]



[thunder rumbles]


[voices speaking Vietnamese]

Clear!

Who's the informant?

Girl... with markings.

Markings?
What kind of markings?

Tattoo.

On her back.


Where is she?

I don't know.

Where is she?

I don't know!


[breathing heavily]


Get him up.

Get him up.

Man, am I glad
to see you guys.

Get up!

You allowed yourself
to be captured.

No.

You call yourself a soldier?
What are you doing?


No!

Let me see your hands.


Soft, pink hands.

You're weak!

You're no fighter.

You don't deserve
to be a soldier.


Leave me.


[insects and birds chirping]

[intense instrumental
music â™ª]

â™ª â™ª



I sent you out days ago.

Welcome back.

We've got more work to do.

Yes, sir.

[birds chirping]

What are you boys
doing out here?

Special Forces.

What the fuck
are they doin' here?

I don't know.

Bet you it ain't good,
though.

Shit.

I bet it has something to do
with that bunker right there.

Yeah.

Bet ya a case of beer
it does.

Yeah, I bet you're right.

Gotta go tell the sarge.

Yeah, yeah... yeah.

Sarge, check it out.

Special Forces ring?

What's that doin' out here?

Sarge...

Found that up on point.

I better get ahold
of Dodge on this.

Get ready to fire up
the radio.

Kip, Johnson...

Yeah?

Take our guests to the flank.

You got it, Sarge.

I don't want any pajama men

jumping' out
and claiming 'em.

Alright guys, c'mon,
move along.

Go on.

C'mon! Move it!
Sarge.

We also got a bunker.
Right over there.

I'm thinking it could be
a whole complex.


And uh, we might even need
engineers, I dunno.

[music grows more intense â™ª]

Ouf!

[speaking Vietnamese]



Your girl. Does she have
a tattoo?

I don't know what you're
talkin' about, man.

I don't know.

You're escorting a traitor,
brethren.

Why would you help
such a person?

[choking and gasping]

You suicidal?


Time to die.


Shall I get our prize?

Your prize, sir.

Excellent.

[helicopter blades thumping]

[on radio] Captain Dodge
to Sergeant Hall.

Captain Dodge
to Sergeant Hall.

What's your status?
Over.

Captain, we're somewhere
to the south.

Off from the Ho Bo woods.

I've got two men down, over.

[on the radio]
In the Ho Bo woods? Over.

Yeah, we stopped
and picked up

some Vietnamese captives
along the way

while we were lookin' for
this Shin guy.

He was our man to show us
the hot spots.

We found a bunker out here,
an NVA bunker. Over.

Sergeant...

You and your men are to leave
the area... now. Over.

We also found a
Special Forces ring out here.

And one of my men's fingers
is cut off.

[radio static]
Sergeant?

Captain, I got men down

and a bunker to check out
here, an NVA bunker.

I'm requesting a backup unit.
Over.

Sergeant.

Pack it up and move it out.

That bunker's been cleared.

Your orders were to
chart hot spots,

not to pick up extra baggage
and engage the enemy.

Over.

Situations came up, sir.

Wait... Captain, you know about
the bunker? Over.

come on home.

I'll see to it that you and
your men get some time off.

Over.

The bunker, sir?

Over.

There is no bunker, Sergeant.

And no Special Forces ring.

The only thing out there

is the blood of your men
that was spilt today.

Good men.

Return immediately!

Out.

Let's move out.


I've been told that a young
girl with a tattoo on her back

has been giving [coughs]
the enemy information.

Many GI's have been killed

because of
this little spy bitch.

She also responsible for the
murder of one of my men.

[shouting in Vietnamese]

Ah, this one's fierce.

Take her to the room.

I'll check her back later...

...as well as her fingers.


Hello my dear...


Read it.

"Case #110 still open.

Find the operative
and execute.

Keep things quiet.

Captain Cook has sent some
engineers to snoop around

for a missing
Special Forces unit."

Continue.

"Case #111 Tiberius,

what is the situation?

Some infantry were cut down
earlier today

Any knowledge
of that situation?

Keep things quiet out there.

Dodge."

Inform Dodge I have
everything under control.

Case #110 and #111
are in effect,

and will be completed
on time.

Yes, sir.

[radio whining]

Case #110. It's yours.

Leave immediately.

Yes, sir.

And I'll bring you a gift
back

from those traitors.

Excellent.

Well done.

[birds singing]

[thunder rumbling]

Oh please, God...

no more fuckin' Samrong.

Here, drink this.

Alright, let's review
why we're here.

Captain Cook's got a pile
of paperwork on his desk

saying there were some
Special Forces...

they came in here...

nobody's heard
from 'em since.

Our job's to figure out
what happened...

and find these guys.

Let's go!

So Lieutenant, tell me
something about those duds

we were just wearin'.

Ever been shot at that
in those,

considering you look like

[in taunting voice]
little rice people.

Shut the fuck up,
shut the fuck up.

To confirm they found
two bodies already...

some of them missing fingers.

Missin' fingers?

Yeah, this whole mission's
been a joke, it's a mess.

Crap, we shouldn't even
be here.

So where is this, uh...
informant?

Whoa, whoa whoa,
you're down you're down...

You're with me Howard,
Howard.


What do you got?

I'm out here lookin'
for Special Forces.

[two gunshots]






Oh... what the fu...

[birds singing]

Oh fuck.

Protect the hive.

There we go.



[grunting and growling]





Ugh!


[heart beat pounding]

[breathing heavily]

Fuck.

Oh shit.

[water splashing]

[tense music â™ª]

â™ª â™ª

[water dripping]


[weak coughing]

I found him just outside
our campsite.

There was another one
with him.


Your ring?

Couldn't find it, sir.

Leave us.

His weapons.

[breathing heavily]



Who are you?


You're not one of us.


Bag this trash!

I got somewhere to be.

No problem.

I got this.


Neither you nor any outsiders

are to be alive
inside of my bunker.


It seems that your party
wishes...

to deny me of my duties
out here.

The oath, the creed
that I took...

to protect and defend
my country...


...It seems that you
have misunderstood...

your oath... haven't you?

What?

My name's
Private Peter Harwick.

My lieutenant
was Chris Jacobs.

We're out here
on a ghost hunt

for some missing
Special Forces guys...

find any leads...
so that Captain Cook

can clear the paperwork off
his desk.

Seems you have found
us ghosts out here,

haven't you?

At least what's left of us.

Who else is with you?

It's just me and the
lieutenant.

No one else?

No.

The army only
sends out two...

to search for me
and my men?



Update?

A wire came in.

Get this to Ranger.

Good work, soldier.

I'm a patriot, out here
in this jungle...

...in this bunker...

there are no laws...

...no rules...

...just survival.

There are traitors...

...all around us, you see.

That's why survival
is so important to us.

These are the ends of traitors
and deserters alike.

I have found them out here

only by operating
outside of the living.

Tell me Private Harwick...

Do you know how to find
traitors and deserters?

No.

You see...

the fingers and the hands...

...tell me if a soldier is
truly dedicated to the creed

or not.

If your hands
are soft and pink...

you serve no purpose.

You will run...
you will not fight.

But if your hands
are calloused...

...hard, rough like stone...

...then you will fight.

Stand and fight.

And you will know the end...

What the hell are you
talking' about?

This is my life's work
out here, you see.

But I am sick now...

I have cancer.

My final hour
will be here soon.

Then...

more traitors and deserters
will come.

Like yourself.

No, I'm not...

They will come.

They will come and they will
overpower me.

I will be tried and
convicted.

I'm just not sure
from which side...

Tell me Private Harwick...

you haven't come
to overpower me, have you?

What the hell are you gonna
do to me?

Well... I'm going to kill you,
of course.

Sir.

Yes?

The wire you requested.

Now... we'll find out if it's
your time, Private Harwick.

Slade took off after another
one of his kind.

Barn Cat, Chainsaw...

they're out there on patrol
somewhere.

I heard some shots...
His friend might be dead.

I didn't notice anyone else,
sir.

Wait... what are you doin'!?

What are you doin'!? Wait!

Don't! Don't!
Please no!

Stop! [shouts]




Bring our captive
to the surface.

I wanna see that girl's ink.

Sir.




[distant coughing]

[girl coughing]

[girl crying]


[man and woman
speaking Vietnamese]


Christ, it smells like shit
in here.

Get up!

Get up!

[girl speaking Vietnamese]

Get up now you gook
mother fuck!

[speaking Vietnamese]

Move, bitch!


The girl we have may be
the one with the tattoo.

Let's see her flesh
when she comes up.

Yes sir.

You know anything about that,
traitor?

Huh?

You hear that?

[gasping and crying]

Before me today, are traitors
to their own kind.

And you will be punished.

be kidding me.

They said a young girl
has a tattoo.

Tell him, my dear, do you
have a tattoo?

Have you killed my brothers?

[pleading in Vietnamese]

And you, Private Harwick...

I charge you
with finding us out here.

And your incompetent
lieutenant

for killing one of my men.

Have you anything to say?

Enough of this!

[girl screams]

Back off now!

Lower your weapons!

Drop the gun!

Lower your weapons!

You won't get far
by killing me.

Drop the gun now.
Drop it!

Drop the gun!

Back off!

This American here,
he's with me.

Drop your gun!

Back off!
Lower your weapons!

Back off!

What the fuck you guys
doin' out here?

Huh?

Cuttin' off fingers is pretty
fucked up!

Me and Private here won't say
anything, alright?

Right Private?

Let's go, get back!

I will die.

I'm takin' the girl!

If she's guilty, they'll hang
her anyways.

Back off now.
Lower your weapons.

Back off.
Lower 'em!

Back off.
Lower your weapons!

Tell 'em now!
Do as he says.

Back it up!
Do as he says.

What?

What are we doin'?
I don't know!

[woman speaking Vietnamese]

I'll cut your fingers off,
I swear.

Shut the fuck up. Take that
thing off her head.

Go! Go.

Hurry up, Harwick!

Get in there!

Don't you dare move.
Don't even move.

Stay there!

Don't you move!

Don't you fuckin' move.

Sit down, sit down!

C'mon, give me your finger.

My God.

Give it to me. Hold still.
Alright. Alright.

Tie it tight, tie it tight.

Oh my God,
where's the lieutenant?

He's fuckin' dead. He got cut
up to shit, up top, man.

Jesus Christ.

Oh my God, okay,
it's gonna be fine.

Hey, what's your name?

Aw, fuck that, oh for...
Stop it!

Harwick, we don't have time
for this!

What's your name?

Ly... Kim-Ly.

Show me the tattoo!
Stop it!

Where's the radio?

How would she know
where the radio is!?

Wire...

The wire leads to the radio?

Let's go, let's get out
of here! Move!

Go!

You two, hunt them down!

Yes, sir.

The bodies, sir.
Get rid of these traitors!

And the fingers?

I'll take care of that later.

Get them!

Hunt them down.

No mercy.

Yes, sir.

Sir?


There will be no mercy here...

Not in my bunker.

I will condemn them all.

All of them.

Here we go, here we go.

Which way?
This way or that way?

That way?

Let's go, come on!
Move, move.

Damn, it's hot.

Captain Cook, sir.

The paperwork
you requested.

Thank you, Private.

Dismissed.

Get this mess cleaned up.

I gotta hit the head.

Soldier!

Grab some gear and let's go!

Move your ass.

Come on, get in.

Move it.

Let's go.

Shit.

How's your finger?

Huh?
How does it look?

What the fuck are they doin'
up there?

Fuckin' Ranger psycho

choppin' off fingers
with a cigar cutter.

What the fuck is wrong
with those Special Forces?

A whole ten of 'em.
They're all fucked up.

Kim, is that ra-
is that wire...

That'll take us to the radio?

Forget about her,
let's drop her.

She's dead weight
and I don't trust her.

I don't have time for this,
man, she's helping us out.

If it wasn't for her,
we'd be fuckin' dead by now.

There's Special Forces
all over the place.

Kim, the wire. Does it lead
to the radio?

Is there where we go?
Just follow the wire?

Wire take us
to the generator?

Kim, the wire.

How does she know
where the radio is?

I dunno, maybe she's been
here before.

And how has she been here
before?

So what if she's been here
before, Harwick!

Does it take us to the radio?

Kim?

Yes?

I wanna see that tattoo,
whether she's got it or not.

What the fuck is the tattoo?
What does that matter?

He was talking' about it.
What are you talkin' about?

Ranger said that she had
a tattoo.

A tattoo of what?

I dunno, she's supposed to
have a tattoo on her back.

The traitor has a tattoo.

No Harwick,
she's not no traitor.

She's helping' us out.

That's great, but I wanna see
that tattoo on her back...

Hey, stop it!

Show me!
Stop it.

God damnit, man!

Shh... Did you hear that?

[fly buzzing]

Did you hear that?
Yeah.

I'm gonna go check it out.

You stay here and watch her.

Don't leave me here
with her.

Harwick, I have to,

or else they're gonna get
the drop on us, okay?

I'll be back.
Fuck.

Stay here and untie her,
she's not no fuckin' slave.

Move, get back here quick.

Listen, bitch, make one wrong
move, I'll fuckin' blast you.

Tiberius, you're creation'
paperwork for me...

and I hate paperwork.

You boys better be here.

Ouf!

Sir.

The wire you requested.

I told you, no mercy!

Dodge.

I already informed you, I
have everything under control.

Guard!

I have more work to do
in the interrogation room.

Remain at your post.

No commie filth...

...or useless soldier will
leave my bunker alive today.

All will be condemned.

[water dripping]

[crying in the distance]

[distant crying]

Hey, I'm not going to hurt you.

Just relax.

Gimme the ropes. I just wanna
untie you, man.

Just get... just take it easy.


Oh God!


Oh fuck.

No... I wasn't here
to hurt you.

Gimme your hands.

Fuck, they tied these tight.

Get this off.

Listen...

I know you're
a fucking traitor

and I wanna see
that goddamned tattoo.

If you move I'll blast your
fucking head off.

Now show me.


Lay down.
Show me that tattoo.



Aah!



Oh my god!

Shit!

Give me that!


Go. Go!

Move.

What happened here?

Fatass stabbed me. Fuck.

You alright?

I'll fuckin' make it.
Where's that child?

Don't worry about it.

You gonna make it through?

We're gonna get through this.

Let's just do it.

Alright, let's go, come on.
Lead the way.

Let's go, Kim.

Follow him.


[flies buzzing]

[snake hissing]

My fallen brothers...

You have all fought and died
with courage and honor.

Because of your bravery...

...you all share
in eternal glory.

I am not long for this world.

My body grows weaker
by the hour.

But there is one more battle
I must endure.

One of our own
has deserted us.

My heart is heavy...

but I know what I must do.

He leaves me no choice.

It's time.

[choking coughs]

[coughing and spitting]

Raven, my brethren,

it's time we discussed
your end.

[choking coughs]

I see you've finally left us
for a drop of water.

I offered you blood.

There was a time when
you were one of my elite.

One of the best.

Not anymore.

Not now.

You're weak.

You're not one of us.

You've gone to the other side.


Their side!
I'm not on their side.

I just couldn't follow
your last few commands.

My commands, yes.

You haven't got the heart
or the soul

to follow my orders anymore.

I know you speak English,
you piece of shit.

I've heard you
through the walls.

You understand me,
don't you?

Yes.

They're not to be trusted...

and yet you accept water from
their hands, don't you?

Yes...

I told you to put two bullets
in their skulls,

and take their fingers.

Listen to what you're saying.

Taking fingers.

Look at you.
You cower like a child!

You're just a shadow of the
man I once knew.

[breathing heavily]

This ring...

...a symbol of honor.

It deems you more
than a mortal man.

You don't deserve
to wear this anymore.

All is lost for you.

But not them, they're not lost.
No, please.

Oh no...

They watch you with their
beady little eyes.

They watch you
while you write letters

to your family and friends.

And those pictures,
those photographs,

that you hold so near and
dear to your heart...

They will take them from you.

They will take them from you
and they will burn them.

So yes... that is why I take
their fingers.

So they will never again

pull the triggers
of their weapons

against your brothers...

my brothers.

Please...

The ring...

The ring, Raven.

Only the strong wear the
ring.

Why have you forgotten it?

[cries out]

Ah... aah.

Sir, untie me
so I can help you.

Help...

...help you say?

Yes...

I'm sure you heard the siege
on my bunker today.

My enemies attacked me
like cowards.

The same way
Booth attacked Lincoln

at the theater.

Like a coward.

All of you will pay for the
attack on my home today.

The weak, the useless...

my enemies...

you all pay with your blood.

I grow tired of raising
my hand against you.

Now you all will raise your
hands against each other.

You were like a son to me.

You disappointed and hurt me
beyond words.

But worst of all...

your courage and commitment
perished.

So, now...

you will do your penance.

You will fight
for your freedom.

You both will fight
for your freedom.

All there of you will fight
for your freedom.

Last man standing
gets to live.

Don't make any sudden
movements.

Untie him. Untie him.

Get back, get back.

Begin.

No! Agh!


Get up, get up!


Get it over with!

Oh God.

Oh God, don't hurt me.

I'm not God...

but you will see Him
soon enough.

[cries out]

I will give you time
to bleed out,

and think about the sins
you've committed

against your country...

Please...

and your brothers.


Move, go on.


Shit's getting' thick up here.

Harwick, what's goin' on?
You alright?

I gotta stop.

What are you talkin' about?
We gotta keep going.

I can't keep goin', man.

Let's go.

We gotta keep going.

I'm fucking weak now, man.
I can't go anymore.

Ly, grab his gun. Grab it.

No! No, no, no, no, no.

Yes, Harwick.
She don't get no gun.

Yes she does.
Bullshit, I don't trust her.

Aah!

Harwick, what's wrong
with you?

There's nothing there!

Bullshit, I saw it!
I don't trust her! Move!

Stop!

Show me that tattoo.

There's no tattoo!
It's just mud!

Fuck you.

Don't you fuckin' dare
hold a gun to me, soldier!

You, stand down!

Fuck, man!

What's wrong with you?

It's just mud!

It's just mud on her back,
man.

Bullshit, I saw somethin'.

You didn't see shit.
No.

Listen, we gotta get
fuckin' help now.

We're goin' to the radio room.
Let's go!

I can't go anymore.

Harwick, I need you
on this one.

I can't go anymore.

I'm losin' too much blood.

I can't go any farther, man.

You gotta go without me.

You cover my six.

Yeah, you got it.
Alright?

If you run into any trouble,
follow the wire.

Alright, you got it.

Move it, Kim.

Move fast and don't trust
that bitch.

Can you handle that hole
in your gut?

I made it this far, didn't I?

Alright.

Go. Stay alive, brother.

Alright.

I have sacrificed everything
out here.

My life...

my soul...


You have no idea.

I have been lied to,
out here in this land.

But I will not back down.

I will fight to the end.

Shit! It's jammed.

[intense music â™ª]


[cries out]



[breathing heavily]

[insects chirping]


[echoing gunshot]

Stay here.

Shh.

Harwick.

Harwick!

It's me.

Can you hear me?

Harwick.

Harwick.

Harwick.

Next time, I will kill you.

Sir.

Case #110 accomplished, sir.

By the way...

I brought you your gift.

Well done.


Blood is in my lungs now.

My time is short.

But we still have
one more case to close.

Before I'm dead...

we must make sure that our
brothers have not died in vain.

That spy bitch...

and that traitor GI...

they're alive in this bunker.

Hunt them down
and kill them.

Sir...

I promise you...

our brothers will not
have died in vain.

Excellent.

Harwick.

Harwick's dead.

We follow wire.

Come.

W... we go.

Let me check that weapon.


It's jammed.

Come.

He was a good soldier.

We gotta go. Come on.

Someone's back there.

Come on. Move.


Shhhh.

Alright. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Hey.

It's time.

Let's go.

I don't want you to leave.

The radio...

GI... GI...

we may never... get out...

a... alive.

Don't worry.
I'll get you top the radio.

And I'll get us out.

I want to know...

...affection...

from GI who care about me.

From a GI?

Yes.

Thank you.

Why do the Special Forces
want you?

I no enemy to you, Han.

It's time.

[two gunshots]


Shh.

[breathing heavily]

Make ready.

The engineer and that little
bitch are on the way.

Take care of them.
Shh.


They're still alive.

You've let our brethren down.

You must die.


[generator whining]

Don't move.

Come on. I'm not here
to kill you.

Sit down.

Now, where are we
on this map?

Vietnam.

Oh, a wise guy, eh?

Open up your channel for us.


Aaah! Fuck, Ly, my ears!

[high pitched ringing]

Whatcha do that for?

Enemy!

I didn't wanna kill him,

he was supposed to open up
the channels.

Do you know how to use
a radio, huh?

No.

Fuck, fuck.

Come on, help me move
this body.

We gotta get rid of him

so that they don't know
that we were here.



Ly...

we gotta get that radio
working.

Come on. We gotta get out
of here.

You know how to use
this radio?

I... I try.
You try? Huh?

I try.

Mayday mayday! This is
Private Johannes Schenke

reporting out of
an old French bunker

in the Ho Bo Woods.

I got Special Forces
down my ass

and I got a civilian with me.

We need help, please.

Can you hear me? This is
Private Johannes Schenke

reporting out of a French old
bunker in the Ho Bo Woods.

I got Special Forces
cuttin' off fingers out here

and killing our own.

They're trying'
to hunt me down.

Ha!


This is too good for you.






[muffled voice on the radio]

[speaking Vietnamese]

You think you can kill
my brothers?

Aah!

It's time to bleed.

Aah!

Aah!

I'm gonna take your soul.
I know you're the one.

Show me your tattoo.


[muffled voice on the radio]


Time to die!





[generator sputters]

[heavy breathing]

Ly!

Come on!

Ly!


Over here!

Come on!





Grab that weapon.

God...

We gotta go.

[breathing hard]

Come on.

Let's go... th... this way.


Come.


Come. Keep going.

Look.


Look.

Look.
[weak laughter]

Han...

Thank you.

[labored breathing]

I sorry... about Harwick.

Aah.

Ready?

How'd you know
how to use that radio?


Ready?

The radio...

How did you know
how to use it?

Let's go. You must-
You must go.

The GI come.


I too went to fight.

I lost... all my family.

I'm sorry.

But now...

I have to be strong...

like GI was to my family.


Come.

Let's go.

What about the radio?

Look at me.

How'd you know
how to use the radio?

Come... GI come.



Yes?

When we get out of here...

I'm gonna take you with me.

Home?

Yeah.

[horns honking]

Captain Dodge, sir.

A wire just came through

about a Special Forces Unit
out in the Ho Bo Woods,

operating in an NVA bunker.

Arrange for a squad
for my arrival out there.

Let's clean this mess up.
Yes, sir.

[birds chirping]

My men...

Where are all my men?

The oath, the creed
you all took...

Fools!


Get over here!

You failed!

You should have killed them
when you had the chance!

Forgive me, sir.

[Ly cries out]




[breathing heavily]

He's out here, isn't he?

I ready.

I fight.

Let's move.

Drop it!

Drop it!

Take him.
Sir.

I'll take this little spy bitch.
Get up!

Move! Get up!


Keep up.

Ly, no!



It appears you've called
for help.

The enemy's getting' closer.

Go on, bring your numbers!
Get up!

Ly...

Look what you've done!
All this time!

No! Aah!

You've been protecting
the enemy!

This spy bitch! This traitor!

Ly!

[crying out]
Ly!

No! No!


Ly!



Ly...

The enemy.


[Ranger shouts]

There's no reason to save
your bent nose.

Guilty.

No!



Sir?



Ly...

[birds singing]


He killed...

Sir, here's the foot locker
you requested.

Aah!

An A... An American did it?
What?

Jesus Christ.

Sir, this isn't charted,

do you want me to bring it
to attention?

What the fuck have you
been up to, Tiberius?

Are those fingers?

My man is missin' a finger.

Is this soldier collecting
'em?

Sergeant Hall!

You will log and chart...
nothing.

Your soul responsibility
is this foot locker.

Am I clear?

Yes, sir.

You hurt anywhere else
on your body?

[Han murmuring]

Alright, let's clean
this mess up!

They killed her...

Captain, you seem
to know a lot

about this Special Forces
soldier and the bunker.

We never gave you directions
on how to get here.


You know...

Virgil...

I've forgotten more than
you know, okay?

I'm afraid, I'm gonna have to
document this in my report.

Let me see your weapon,
soldier.

You know, Sergeant...

you won't be documenting
anything.


How's it goin'?

Let's get you the hell
out of here.

Ly... Ly... Ly!

Let's go. She's dead,
don't you worry.

Well...

Private Johannes Schenke.

Being as you're all healed up,

your new duty
is to drop back...

into that NVA area...

solo mission.

As you are aware...

There are more tunnels
in the outer sector.

And intel has told us
nothing about them.

Now, those tunnels
lead somewhere, son.

And we need to know where.

If you run into any
trouble...

not that I expect you to.

There an infantry division
out there, calls themselves...

...The Indians.

They're charting hot spots.

Cigar?

Private...

What happened out there
at that bunker

with Tiberius Ashwood...

...Ranger...

didn't happen.

It never occurred.

It's a... figment...
of the imagination.

Do we have
an understanding, son?

Yes, sir.

That bunker burned.

Along with all
of Tiberius' mayhem.

Everyone who ever set foot
in that bunker

is now dust or ash.

Except for you.

You have your orders.

Sir...

[door closes]

What if he talks?

He'll never make it
to Christmas.

That area's in the heart
of the jungle

and it will bleed him dry.

Now, no one...

must even find out what
happened with Tiberius

out in that bunker.

I sent him out to do ops.

Not to cut off fingers.

He lost his humanity
out there.

Understood, sir.

[helicopter blades thumping]

ETA ten minutes, boys!

Get some of those slant-eyed
gook motherfuckers!

You know, they're good
quality people, man.

Fuck 'em.
