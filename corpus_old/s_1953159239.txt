I would have taken it.
And come out of your box?

What kind of mother I would have then?

The doctor said 70% of the

Did you know Wade Hutchinson?
You were school friends.

He said yes.
Someone made a clear mark.

You will not talk about it to anyone.
It would rise to a terrible uproar.

All right, Sheriff.

I have eaten.

Good boy... but he does not

Teepee?

I was looking at having something  exports...
Mad room.

We took the waste loading bay -

One patient had painted

The container was left behind.
Only a few knew about it.

When the container is moved a bit...

Since it had been in the shade, the colors
had remained beautiful.

Crazy's finger painting?
Is that you hyped up?

The hospital made you zombie.
You have not had reason to be there.

Once again the culprits are in freedom.
Yes, it is lousy.

Let's go. Is cash held?
Cash? It is.

The pool has been wiped, washed in buckets.
You forgot to lock the door.

So are you.
Yes, but I believe that I slowpoke.

You had a vision.
You do not have slowpoke.

I wish you would not be so damn wrong.

I tried different things when you were somewhere else.

I divided leaves, and waste time.
I was in snow up to create this job.

I tried the police hommaakin.
Sheriff just laughed at me.

Did you want  policeman?
It's not important.

She is your daughter.
You have a right to be with him.

Yeah, but it does not fit right now.

Imagine that we ran into each other.
It was probably one of the brand.

It was intended that we would meet.

Maybe.

Do you want coffee?
I do not. It takes a night's sleep.

I want to know everything about you.
How do you like? Stories of repairing?

of their day.

Yes, you invented something.

Thank you for having arranged for me

Whether you purchase your badge and you will take
turpanne or shutting up.

What a tableau.
Tableau?

Look at this from a broader perspective.
It is part of the package.

The murderer used to abstract expressionism -

and dadaa. It is a celebration of Marcel
Duchampsille.

The bodies have been set
purely minimalist.

As the waste container and wicker chair.

Bath picture... imprisonment.

I create the right.

Penalty.
The penalty of what?

I do not know Ernie.

Why smell eucalyptus tree?
How does it taste like spaghetti?

It is disgusting.

Shame on you.
See what I bought from a service station.

To some extent, it would contribute.
All right.

Do not think of anything?
Give a little while.

Okay, I'll start.

Where did this come from?
I do not want to talk about it.

Fencing? Wrestling?
Not quite.

More fun than the scar on Harry Potter.
Flash - the time homoa.

I would like the nickname koriksessa.

Iceman, Admiral, The Postman.

When you have a nickname, you know that

Georgina would be much nicer.

I think Amy is a nice name.

We did not know anything about each other.
I do not recommend.

What do you like Green Oaks?
To date, very nice.

I am a travel agency at work.
It's quite boring.

I do it because of cheap travel.

I would like to visit England to meet with parents

I do not know.

I have not really ever traveled.
How is that possible?

I am, I was elsewhere.
Elsewhere? In prison?

In a way, .

Alcoholic.
He ??filmed me when I slept, and betrayed all the time.

I do not condemn anyone.

I am amazed at the paintings
detail.

I drew stick-opening time, and I wrote
stick figure.

No one yet knew what it was.

That's really incredible.

So, it's nice.

Who is it? A frustrated artist or a harsh critic of

For some reason, it relaxes me.

Well, I leave you here to draw.

Take care.

I only see the tire marks in the clay.

Should this be found in Jesus'
latent image?

None. Those traces were found in
drive-in movie theater.

They are Yokohama T4 rings avid.
Time conventional tires.

How common?
Gary has been selling a lot of them.

Get a list of Garylta -

Did not mean to laugh.

It's all right, but it is difficult to

I refuse from driving.
It is because of the steering wheel.

Small false move and someone dies.
I would have too much power.

I want it over so I can get.
As a father you have all the power.

It sounded like the world's worst
greeting cards.

It's no use trying.

I was a Special Forces soldier.
And I was a Navy Sealsissa.

And I was in Gettysburg.

What the hell?

Kuteja I have left.

Damn.

Why is he not taken the body?
Judging by the tire tracks -

he became very busy.
He ??was suspended.

He was frightened.

I wonder if he ready now?

Sir?

Thank you, darling.

Knife slipped.

I have to go.

Tire Tracks are the same as
drive-in theater visiting.

Tyre Dealers  Gary said that Ken
bought one of those a month ago.

Yes, the same tires, but it's still not enough
boy's arrest.

He attended the same school.
Was he a team?

Can not we question him?
Boyd is crazy, but it is not enough.

If I reserve Ruth's son, and I'm
wrong, the administration ends.

Hi. How are you?

Hi. I am leaving for work.

Not to come to nothing.

It would amuse me to say that what...
Do not tell me then!

Now you know why I did not give you

Not today.

Do you have what I want to see the mokaa.

Fury.

What are you doing here?
Nice to see you too.

I just came to ask why you did not come at all.

I had to be at work.

Not that anything would come.

I do not understand.
, We have had fun together.

... A series of murders is
stimulated discussion.

Is a small green Oaks killing of four
.

Kenneth Boyd, 34, city resident, was arrested last night,
-

four others on suspicion of murder by city-
.

The police said they are premeditated
executions.

A weapon was an ax, knife macheteja
. Boyd was a while ago-

treatment which he had received from
because of depression.

The victims have been identified
Marty Prichard, Wade Hutchinson-

Lyle Bagwell and Brett Miller.
All local business people.

I have to admit that I was hoping it
that you would not be you.

Open this contraption.
The red button and play.

I'm sorry that I went to your room,
but these drawings...

They are really beautiful.

See them.

Although the time for a sick way.

You will be stayed for some of these tracks
crime locations.

That's how they make the tires...
Leave their mark.

It took some time before we realized
how did you join the whole matter.

Who is so hard to hate a team that
he would kill the players later on?

I went to the mayor's speeches, and...
Do you take gum?

We were talking about the festival...

Then it came to my mind.
Who would be the motive? Who?

Who?

Hello? Who?

That's right.

Pöllöllä.

Irv, I'm sorry your friend's why.

Tuit him and he was a disappointment to you
. Is it so strange?

If you have tunaroinut whole life
eventually everything will go towards the pine.

Well. See the little Fooger-people.

Hi, Amy.
Hey, Irv.

Is it possible to talk about the father?
Now?

You know him. Perhaps you could help me understand the
.

Yeah. Come inside.

Did you go to greet the father
often when he was there?

I did not go. Please sit down.

Why did not you?

I wanted
, but it was difficult.

I did not want to see him in such a condition
.

Why is he hated them
basketball players?

He wanted to get on the team.

It was a hard blow when she could not get by
. He became the mascot.

A little while he thought he was one of them
.

But the gang bastards do not
have seen things so.

It just got worse and got worse until...

They thought it could make him a
just about anything.

Then he did it
comic book in which he described them idiots.

After all, they were accustomed
royal treatment.

Then the whole school laughed them.

One night  -

they decided to take revenge on him.

What did they do?

Do you want water? I'll get.

I do not think he is not recognized?
No.

Do not deny he did not know.

He just sat there.

I would have thought that
he could do any harm to someone.

It's hard to imagine what those guys did to him
.

What does it then it was
that was bothering me.

It seems hard now when I'm
son arrested for murder.

But I hope that we will, over time,
get it behind us.

I do not think so.

Can I take that one beer?
Take off.

I'm going to drink and go.
Do not tell the police.

Amy did it for me.
Is not that damn cute?

I wish I were as creative. It would probably damn
at ease.

This.
Thank you.

What was that? -My cat.
It does not want to be locked up.

Do you have a cat? What breed is?

I do not know, a normal cat.
Are the many?

After all, they are at least 40 races.
I did not know.

These were really great, Kenny.
Who would not like mail?

They scared the shit your pants.
Do you know what I like in particular?

I am a monster.
It was scary.

Good job.
Thank you.

What are you doing here, Kenny?
Do us a message now.

It was the Son of Sam,
or something like that.

It was good water. Thank you.

You still want something?
Cat does not seem to be fine.

Do I get to go and see it?
You do not. It is a jumpy.

That's why I veinkin the room.
I'll get along well with cats.

I prefer not. -Why not?
I'm a bit overprotective.

I would be kind to it.
Not now, Amy.

Looks like a cat sounds sick.
Well, it can be.

Is not that a boy cat?
Stop it already!

Amy, it is best that you go home.

Okay, I'm leaving. Sorry.

It is the best.

Goodbye, Amy.

I've watched the screen.
The drawings do not speak against you, quite the opposite.

You unpack yourself through them.

You kill them in the picture, so that it
need to do really.

Shitty hated them and wanted them to die.

You might even
did you go to crime scenes.

Maybe you wanted to convince
to yourself that you could do that.

You are an artist, you're a murderer.

You can only do harm to yourself.

Son, Now this is starting to become really interesting to
.

You kill a few guys on paper
and so these guys are dying.

If you do not have the date, it was a
a hated them equal.

Who could be the punishment of the need for a
?

One sick...  Sick as...

What is your friend Irv
has been up to lately?

By little. Shut up.

Your father gave his all, and they wanted to destroy him
.

Took his soul, his
ruined my life. I could have prevented it.

You make me ill!
I had to do something.

Let me go!
Would you just tell.

It's over now. Is that clear?
Take it easy.

I've never been in the past
kill anyone.

When I killed Prichard was a good feeling.

When I killed Wade Hutchinson
was damn awesome feeling.

Anger grew, and each pig killed
after living only improved.

Ken could not have done it.

He could not
do what should have been done.

Took care of the five friends.
Why Fooger?

The bed again Ken.

I did not want to do it again.

Evil must be punished.

You are quite a friend.

But you should have
shoddy police.

I wanted to actually kill them.
Yeah, but you did not kill.

Damned if people wish to kill the bastards -

we all were sitting in a life.

I have to ask this. Why did you want to take the cause of niskoillesi
?

I do not know what part I have
in this world.

Being locked up seems a lot easier.

If you have not understood the purpose for
you are more stupid than I thought.

Can I help you?
I came to pick my daughter.

Amy!
Ken, what are you doing here?

Hello, huvittaako come to us?
Yeah!

Get your stuff.

You can not just be about him.
-11 Years. Now it is my turn.

How's it going? Well?

This is for you.
What is it?

Just a little thing.
A puppy?

SAVIOUR

It has all the best nickname.
Thank you, Dad.

I apologize.

I apologize for the story.
I am truly sorry.

Oh, and I am not guilty.

Nervous weekend.
