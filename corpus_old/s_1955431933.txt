And this year will be no exception.

My reputation is on the line.

[all] Right!
Got it?


You see? Now this is why I know

The Horse is always up, man.

Bean Boy.
Tell your president what today is.

It's Halloween time, sir!

And why is Halloween so important
to this frat's reputation, Bean?

Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we have the longest tradition

of throwing the best
Halloween parties ever, sir.

[people cheer]
And what will be your contribution be

to make sure that tonight
is the best party ever?

I've been recruiting
some of the best talent on campus.

This is pledgee Cummings.

Best in my class.

How's it going, man... Sir?

And I found this guy.
Pledgee Mond...

Mondon!
Mondon! Oh.

This is pledge Mondon, everyone.

Whoa.
Weird name, cool guy.

This guy can hack into anything.
I mean, anything.

[man] Nice.
K? Remember last year?

When he hacked into the Beta Sorority?

Yes! Yes!
Into the webcams?

[people cheering]
I remember that.

I remember that.
Yeah!

Very illegal, kind of creepy.
But very fun, nonetheless.

Dude, can we do that again?
I was so happy.

Breathe. Take a breath.
That's why I got him.

And, sir, this is pledgee
Wells and Dimps,

and they are very special.

Pledgees, show them.

In high school, 30 years ago.

Chill out, pops. It's cool.

Did Thor just...

What the hell are you telling me,
"Chill out, pops"?

You don't tell me to chill out, okay?
That's my daughter, son.

Son, Fabio, whatever.
[boys chuckle]

Nobody's talking to you.

Go somewhere, grow your hair
and stay out of this, okay?

Sir, I'll take
care of them, okay?

Back to the frat house.

You see? [scoffs]

It won't happen again, sir.
I'm so sorry. Bye, girls.

how many times have I told you

not to walk past this frat house?

Well, we were just
walking by, Mr. Simmons,

and they stopped us.

It's not our fault.
We didn't do anything.

You're coming home.
Get in the car.

No. No, no, no, no, guys.

There's no room in there
for all of us.

The house is right there.
We're just gonna walk.

Tiffany, get in the car.

It's right there. We can walk.
Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Bye, Mr. Simmons.
Bye!

He seems angry.

She never listens to you.

So you know my mom used to
teach theater in school, right?

So I have all these
really cool costumes in the attic.

We're gonna come up with something
so hot for the party tonight.

Hot?
Do you know your dad?

He's not gonna let you go.

Just let me deal with that, okay?

Just meet me here at 10:00
and we can figure it out from there.

Okay.
I don't know.

She's coming. You're coming.

I am so excited.

I know, this is gonna be so wild.


Bye, girls!
Bye!

Oh, Lord.
I don't know about this.

You're coming. Come on.

We gotta figure out
what we're gonna wear.

Ohh!
Gonna be so fun!

boys there. I don't like that.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not so fast. Not so fast.

Listen to me.
How many times do I have to tell you?

Do not walk past that frat house.

You're out there,
you're talking to those guys.

They are college kids.

You're 17 years old, you're not
supposed to be talking to them.

Do you understand me?
And what do you have on? What is this?

Tiffany, I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

Do not take your uniform off

until you get into this house.
Are we clear?

Leah and Rain's mom lets them do it.

I am not Leah or Rain's parent.

I am your parent.
Do you understand?

And what I tell you,
you have to learn to listen to.

I don't want you to do it.

Okay, then buy me a car

so I won't have to
walk past the frat house.

Do you hear yourself?
I'm not buying you a car.

That makes no sense to me.
I'm not buying you a car.

You have to finish school...
Finish school. I... Yeah...

Do not mock me.
[mockingly] Do not mock me.

Tiffany! Stop!
[mockingly] Tiffany! Stop!

Stop... You...
[continues mocking]

Then stop talking.

I'm an adult, I can say
what I wanna say in this house.

Do you understand?

I can say what I wanna say

and what I'm telling you
right now is this.

You have to watch out
for those college kids.

Those boys want one thing...

Um, one thing
and what's that thing?

The thing is for somebody
to pay their student loans.

Now go upstairs and finish your...
Do something and get packed.

Okay, Dad, sure.

But I know you're not talking
about student loans.

Go get packed.

Packed?
Where is he going?

He and you, you're both
going to your mom's.

I have work to do, so you
and your brother are going.

She's coming to pick you up.

I'm 17, I do not
have to go to my mom's.

I am not leaving you
in this house on Halloween.

I don't care if you're 17,
you're not staying here alone.

Okay, well then
Aday can stay with me.

How about that?

I will?
Yes, you will.

Oh, actually, my parents wouldn't mind
me staying here for Halloween.

We don't celebrate it anyways.
My dad...

Well, I think he'd actually
be okay with it, actually,

because every Halloween,
we just go to church.

To church?
Yes, church on Halloween, sir.

Actually, a lot of the parents
don't like their children

celebrating the Devil's holiday with
the ghosts and the goblins and whatnot.

So they bring their children to church.

They get dressed up
in holy costumes and Bible characters.

You know, last year
I was actually the Ghost.

Wait, you just said
they don't celebrate ghosts.

Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

Yeah, and then we also have
a carnival, as well.

We give candy out to the children
so they don't feel left out.

And the adults,
they have a prayer service.

And it's all good, it's all jolly
and we just love getting together...

Okay. Okay, all right.

Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, sir.

Please go ahead and call him.
No, no, no.

Thank you very much.

But no, I'm not leaving you
in this house.

No, okay, there's no way
I'm going to Mom's.

Absolutely no, no, no, no, no.

No way. We're staying.
So call her dad.


Come on, Aday.
Ooh.

I do not know about this party tonight.

I don't wanna go.
No, it'll be fun. Okay, listen.

We have to go.
Girl, we cannot stay in this house.

Leah and Rain are going.
It'll be fun.

But, I... It's just...

No! No, but nothing, okay? Come on. Sit.

Listen, they like us.

And they're the most
popular girls in school.

[whispering] Popular...
Okay? We can't not go

and be right where we were
when we first got to that school.

They're popular because
they wear those baby shirts

that shows what the Good Lord gave 'em.

Plus, why do they have to set the trend?

Okay, number one,
those baby shirts are called crop tops.

And did you see how those guys
were drooling over them?

Did you see how they were
drooling over you?

Because I took notes from them.

Okay. Come on.
We gotta go to the attic,

create something
really hot for tonight.

Let's get.
[whispering] Hot...

[phone beeps]
Wait.

He's texting me.
Who's texting you?

Jonathan, the cute frat boy.

I thought that boy
was staring at Rain.

He was, for now. Come on.

For now?
Yeah.

<i>[Debra]
She needs to stay with me.</i>

Debra, I already told her that, okay?
She doesn't wanna stay with you.

<i>You're her dad,
you need to put your foot down.</i>

<i>Are you listening?</i>

Yes, I'm listening to you.

<i>Well?</i>
Yeah, I know I'm her dad.

You're her mom, okay?

I can't...
<i>Get</i> her ready!

She doesn't wanna come,
she doesn't have to come.

<i>She doesn't</i> wanna go...
<i>- But she needs to.</i>

All right, listen. Just come...
Come and pick BJ up.

I don't wanna argue about this.
Now I'm on my way.

[cell phone beeps]

Tiffany, somebody...

The hell?


This girl.

[distant howling]

Open your little bag up wide.

So I can drop it
all the way down to the bottom.

you sitting out here with these...

What you doing with these canes, Bam?



You know I had hip surgery.
I need these canes.

You don't need them canes,
stop that lying.

I seen you running
up and down the street.

Mabel, I need these canes,

and let me tell you,
they were high as hell, too.

Too much for a woman on a fixed income
and I ain't got no extra money

to be wasting on no canes like these.

So I gotta use these so that I don't
have to go back to the hospital.

I know them
two little girls right there.

If you... Hold on
just a second, honey.

If you're so worried
about money on a fixed income,

why the hell are you out here
giving these little heathens candy?

Mabel, I like this.
No, Bam, uh-uh. No.

This is why I'm not
in my damn house right now.

What?
I don't like no doggone Halloween.

I'm not gonna be giving them children
no candy for free. Hell!

When I was growing up, do you know
what I had to do for candy?

Do you know
what I had to do for candy?

What, Mabel?

I had to give up candy to get candy.

That's why.
But I'm not gonna do that,

spend my hard-earned money
on no candy gifting.

It's going in my retirement,
my Ho-O-1-K.

I'm not gonna do it,
give no child no candy.

Mabel, what is Ho-O-1-K?

It's for hoes.

It's for all of those women
who never ever

were able to pay taxes on their money
because they got it illegally.

So you put the money aside.
It's not a 401 K, it's a Ho-O-1-K.

That's why I got a Ho-O-1-K.
Oh!

Yeah, from back in the day
when I was stripping.

I wonder why...
When I was on that pole.

I'm not gonna spend
my Ho-O-1-K on nobody.

No, I'm not gonna do that,
giving no children no candy.

I don't know why you doing it.

Now, see, look at this.
Look at this.

Trick or treat.
Oh!

Look at his little outfit!

Here you go!
Here you go, baby, right here.

What's he supposed to be?

He's a G.I.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

He salute.

Yeah.

Barn.
I like them a bit...

Barn. I saw your ass.
Yeah.

Saw me do what?


Barn, I saw you drop
a little piece of candy up in there

and take four or five pieces
out of that baby bag.

What the hell?
Shh!

Is that what you out here doing?

Mabel, shh!

Why you doing that?
Mabel, sometimes you get

the munchies after you smoke, honey,
and this candy be coming in handy.

And lookit, I been doing this for years.

Barn.
What?

You high now, ain't you?

Yeah.

Uh-uh. Mabel, look, don't judge me.
I got a prescription.

I'm so glad, I was so glad
when this thing finally came!

Hey! I can't wait
to show it to the police.

Put that away, Bam.

Sitting here high,
taking candy from babies.

You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

Well, you gotta teach them something.

You gotta teach 'em something
and you gotta teach them at some time.

I don't like this Halloween stuff.

Trick or treat.
Oh!

I'm the trick, she the treat.
Now go the hell on.

Why they got that boy
dressed like a cow?

You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

Got that child dressed
like chocolate milk in a box.

Mabel!
What?

Don't do that.
You gonna scar this baby.

But you better watch him, Bam.

Mmm-mmm.
Uh-uh, you better watch him,

Mmm-mmm.

That's a O.G. right there.
I'm telling you right now.


[Barn] Mabel!
[Madea] What? I'm telling you,

you better watch him.

He... He ain't gonna fall for that.

He counting every one
of them damn candies.

He ain't counting calories,

but he counting them damn candies.

Hey, baby. Don't mind her at all.
You just come stay right there.

Let me pick and see
which one I'm gonna give you.

I'm gonna give you two of these.
You about to get stabbed.

Look at this. Here you go!
That boy ain't playing.

Put it down here
so I can put it in there.

Here you go, baby! There you go.

Oh, Lord...

There you go. All right, go on.

[both chuckling]

Wait a minute.

What'd I tell you?

I had more candy in here than this.

Biggie about to shoot you, Tupac.

I don't... I don't know what...

I have no idea
what you talking about.

You took candy
from my pumpkin, grandma.

No, I didn't do that, baby.
Why would I do that? Mabel?


You tricked me.

You put candy in
but took a handful out.

What... Did you do that?

Did you see me do that?
Listen, let me tell you something.

You need to teach your son
these principles at home, honey.

That's why they call it
"trick or treat."

[Madea laughing]

That is not nice.
What's wrong with you?

Hold on now, you ain't finna be
gettin' on my damn friend.

Let me tell you something, honey.

You gone and had your child
disrespecting her, okay?

If she say she didn't do it,

You understand?
We let us... Hold on.

You talk about look at her?
Look at your child.

He is just perfect.

What's wrong?
You asking what's wrong with her?

What's wrong with your damn child?

[Barn] Mabel. Mabel.

That baby can hear you.

I don't give a damn if he can hear me.

You need to have him trick or treating

I don't like this.

They better not come over here with

but trying to scare y'all.

Don't do that, Hattie.
You know I'm scared of everything.

every time she gets too scared

she drop a tear and if she laugh
too hard, she'll squirt a little pee.

Mabel, you don't have to
keep telling everybody that.

Well, it's the truth.
No, it ain't.

Yes. You know you squirt a little pee

every time you get scared.
No, I don't!

It's true. You probably wet right now.

Thank you so much for sharing.
I appreciate it, thank you.

Bam, that ain't polite conversation.

You know, just one or two drops,

The parents I don't understand.

That's what it is. Right there.

If these parents were getting in charge
of these children here,

we wouldn't be having all these issues.

Come on, you know. Those teenage years,
when they turn into a teenager.

Boy, I remember them
teenage years, baby,

I remember them teenage years.

You got to drop the damn hammer.

Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Drop the hammer on them.

Them teenage years, hell.

I'm tellin' ya, I keeps me a hammer.

Now we know what the problem is,
anybody in here got a solution?

Is he slow? He don't understand
nothin' I'm saying.

Hattie, can you explain this to him
in a language that he understands?

Whoop. That. Ass.

[Hattie snorts and laughs]

All in favor say "aye."

[all] Aye.
The ayes have it.

Where she at?
Where she at?

I get the switch.
Sit down. I am not hitting my child.

What? You can't stomach it?

We'll whoop that ass for you!
No!

Nobody is hitting my child, okay?

I told them early
you need to whip them kids,

I been tellin' him
since they were little.

"Whoop her! Whoop her!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!"
What'd he do?

He don't whoop her ass.

Listen, we have never spanked our
children, ever. We didn't do that.

We weren't those kind of parents.

Well, that's the problem right there!
[Bam] That's right.

That's right, that's right! Whoop her.
Baby, let me tell you something.

I'm not tellin' you to go up there
and abuse no child.

Even though
I got a hammer in my purse.

I'm just kidding about the hammer.


But listen, what I'm trying to get you
to understand is very, very simple, son.

Hear me clearly. A little love tap
ain't never hurt nobody.

There it is. Love tap.
[Madea] A little love tap.

Just tap your child.
A little love tap.

Like I did you,
I gave you lots of love taps.

Lot... What?

Hold on a second,
did you just say "love tap"?

No, no, no, no, no.

That wasn't a love tap,
I was on life support.

Are you...
Are you blaming that on me?

That is not my fault.

What'd I have to do with you
being on life support?

Am I missing something? I was
four years old. Whose fault was it?

I told your ass to stop talking back
to me and what did you do?

I said... [imitates babbling]
I was talking back.

Right. So when I bust your ass
and you ended up

in the damn life support situation,
whose problem did that belong to?

You better hold up,
she gonna explode her prostate.

Right. That's your own damn fault.

The defense rests, Your Honor.

Mmm-hmm.
The case is closed.

Thank you. The jury has been excused.

You guys don't understand, okay?

I know in your day you could do that,
you could beat kids, you could slap 'em,

but this is a different day and time.

You can't spank your kids
these days, okay?

You go to jail
for things like that now.

That's what it is?
You're politically correct.

Let me tell you somethin' about
"you can't hit your kids these days."

And hear me clearly
when I say this to you, son.

Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

Daddy, I'm gonna tell you one more time,
stop using that language in this house.

Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!


Stop all that saying all them cuss words
up in here, Joe, hell.

Boy, if I didn't whoop your ass
you know where you'd be right now?

Somewhere strung out on drugs.

You don't know the hell...
trying to get 20 dollars for a fix.

You don't know what the hell
you talkin' 'bout.

That's why you turned out
well like you did.

That's why you're a federal prosecutor.

Hell, I beat you so much you were scared
to look at a damn crack pipe.

You ain't know
what a damn crack pipe was.

You know what a crack pipe
is now, don't you?

See, he still don't know
what the hell a crack pipe is.

You know why that is?
'Cause I beat your <i>ass.</i>

rough on that boy. I felt so bad.

See, your daddy was raw.

He'd beat the hell out you
and leave you out in the street,

just bloody guts all over, everywhere.

I at least would
take you to the hospital

after I knocked the hell out you.

Look, son, just go on up them
stairs, and do what I had to do to you

that day that you got mad at me.
Just go on, do what you gotta do, son.

Bite the bullet.

I am not taking my daughter on the roof
and throwing her off.

Why wouldn't you do that?

He did that?
Yes!

[laughs]
[Madea] He sure did.

I'ma just tell you somethin',

if you're gonna try
and teach a child a lesson

and push 'em off a roof,
at least check they pockets.

Joe, you should have
checked his pockets.

I forgot about that little pencil. Oh.
Number two, yellow stick.

He had his little pencil
in his pocket...

Little pencil went straight through

one of his little balls.
[all exclaim]

Looked like a little
Tootsie Roll on a stick.

That poor thing.

I was traumatized.

Let me ask you somethin'.
Did you die?

That's not funny.
That's not funny.

I bet that's just
so interesting to see.


I just wanna look at it.

I bet you have problems
peein' too, don't you?

You probably just have one drop.

Plop.
[all laugh]

Bam, hush that.

Oh... Oh...
Did it grow back?

Grow back?

I'm... I'm not a reptile, it doesn't...

Well, he just told us
he ain't no anaconda.

[all laughing]

Though I almost felt bad when I saw
that little number two yellow pencil.

He almost got lead poisoning.

Daddy, you shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

That's all I'm gonna say.

You shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

Again. Did you die, nigga?

How many times I have to tell you?
Stop using that word.

That is a horrible word.

I don't even understand
why you keep using that word.

Stop saying it, it's horrible!

It's awful. All these people
use it in the music...

All these kids
are in these clubs saying it.

Stop saying that word!

<i>Bitch ass.</i>

Daddy, I'm warning you. Stop that...

Nigga.
Okay, let's get this clear.

Nobody is laying a hand
on my daughter, okay?

Now, Madea, can you please not tell her
that I asked you to come by?

Okay, can you please
just tell her that...

Um...

You were in the neighborhood,
and... And you stopped by.

Okay? Can you do that?

Yeah, he wants me to lie.
I'm not gonna lie.

I don't do that. I'm not a liar.
Why? You scared of her?

No, I'm not scared of her, but I just...

I'm trying this approach
that I read in a book,

that you and your kids should be...

Buddies. Pals.
You should be friends.

Friends? You ain't
supposed to be friends

with your damn child, you the parent.

Y'all not equals.

What the hell you talkin' 'bout,
a friend? A friend?

They have to listen to
what the hell you tell them to do.

If they don't, they gotta
bounce they <i>ass</i> up out the house.

Go pay they own mortgage.
Go pay they own rent.

Go pay something, do you understand?

Being a damn child friend.

What the hell is wrong with you,
talkin' 'bout being your child friend.

That's stupid as hell!
I hear you, okay?

[Tiffany] Dad, you haven't left yet?
Um...

Hi.
Hi.

Remember what I said to you.

That you stopped by.

What?
Ms. Madea, how are you?

Oh, I'm fine, how you doin', baby?
Good to see you.

Good to see you, too.

Who the hell is that?

Mabel! That's the pastor's daughter.

Damn, you don't know that?

Hell, even I know that
and I don't even go to church.

You don't know that's
the pastor's daughter? Damn.

Sinner! Devil.

You know I don't know no pastor.

She rolled up on me
like she know me, like...

"Hey, how you doing?"
I don't know her like that.

Mabel, everybody know you, honey.

You been on the news so much.

Barn, you ain't gotta
tell people all my business.

Um, so, what are they doing here?

I have no idea.
Oh.

I just opened the door,

and barn! There was Madea.
Really?

Yeah. Yeah.
Oh.

I opened the door, she said,
"Happy Haller-ween."

You know how she says "haller"
and everything, so...

Madea, what are you doing here?

What the hell you mean
"what bring you by?" You called me.

Oh. Oh. Um...

I was in...

The neigh...

The neighborhood, and...

I came... I was on my way to walk...

I was in the neighborhood and I came by
to talk to your... Oh.

To spend the... To stay the night.

Oh, I was in the neighborhood,
I came by to stay the night, yeah.

That's too much to remember.
Dad.

What? I didn't...
I didn't know. I had no idea.

I had no idea she was coming.

But isn't it great?
No!

Now you have somebody
to be here with you all night.

That's great.
Happy Haller-ween.

Thanks, Dad.
[whispering] Thank you.

Listen, thank you for
having us over here, Brian.

Okay?
[Brian] I'll see you later.

Hey, where the hell the liquor at?

[door shuts]
I was so worried at my house.

You know, I'm scared of everything.
Scared of everything.

And this Halloween stuff
just give me the creeps.

She don't like...
She don't like Haller-ween.

Mmm-mmm. Don't like it at all.

It just give me the creeps.
But now I'm all right.

'Cause we all here together.
All here together.

That's right.
Together.

Okay, well, I'm tired of talking
to you old people,

so I'm gonna go upstairs.

Nice to meet you!

that want to go grab that girl

and slap the shit out of her.
But I'm not gonna do it.

Oh, it's getting late.

We gotta hurry if we're gonna
catch this party.

This makes me so mad.

I can't believe my dad got all these
old people here to watch me.

Oh, it's not that bad.

You know, Ms. Barn
kinda reminds me of my grandma.

She always gets
really scared on Halloween.

Starts talkin' 'bout
the devil and what not.

But then she just goes to sleep early.

She just wants the day to be over with.

Wait, no, that's it.

We're gonna trick them
into going to bed early.

Trick them?
What do you mean, trick them?

We're gonna scare the hell out of 'em.
Okay, listen, Aday.

When I tell you to press this,
you press it, 'kay?

Is this a bomb or something?

No, it's not a bomb,
it controls the lights.

Oh, thank God.
Come on.

I thought we were blowing
old people up today.

No.

I'm tryin' to make it
to heaven, Tiffany.

They got a nice wood-burning fire.

Yeah, people don't have no
wood-burning fireplaces no more.

Everything's gas now, these children.

We done got gas on everything.

Did good.
[Tiffany] Hey.

Look what I brought home from school.

What... What the hell is that?

It's a ghost board, Grandpa.

Get that... Get that

No, ma'am. Uh-uh.

Get that devilment out of here.


No, it's fun.
It's how you communicate with the dead.

You heard her.
Get it on out of here, honey.

We don't play with stuff like that.
Get that up out of here.

No, it's fun!

I'ma tell you right now, if you open it,
that's what you're gonna be.

Dead. You're gonna be
on the other side.

We not playing with stuff

We don't play with stuff like that.
Give me... Put this down.

What is that that fell out of the thing?

What is that? I don't touch this stuff.

I grew up in New Orleans,
they got voodoo everywhere.

No.

It's a card. It says, "Death."

Oh, no.

Ain't no "oh, no."
I'ma tell you right now.

See, y'all children
don't understand.

Let me make this
perfectly clear to you, honey.

You don't be playing around.

Keep playing with the devil,
he gonna show up.

Yeah, he gonna show up. He's sittin'
right there in front of you.


I tell you right now,
don't play with me, little girl.

That's what you gonna look like,

just like that damn skeleton
on that card.

Doin' a pirouette.
You understand? Go to bed.

You don't understand.
This card comes from Mr. Wilson.

The man that died
in this house on Halloween.

He killed his entire family and put
all of their bodies in the attic.

And it's said that every Halloween
he comes back to take a life.

And the only place he doesn't go
in this house are the bedrooms.

Because that's where
the priests used to sleep

when this house was a monastery.

Whoa.
I know.

So we should all go to sleep.
It's safer there, anyways.

The ghosts come out at midnight.

Okay. Time for me to go.

[Madea] Barn.
I gotta get out of here.

Bam, hold the hell on.

Barn.
What?

What the hell's wrong with you?

Mabel, did you hear what she just said?

Barn.
What?

You forgot your canes.

On!
On!

Joe!

But ain't God good?
I don't even need my canes, Mabel.

[Madea] Sit down!
Mabel.

Hell, we been helpin' you for days,

and you sittin' there actin' like
somethin' wrong with you.

Ain't nothing wrong with you. Sit down!

Yes.

This girl ain't doin'
nothin' but sitting here lyin'.

No, I'm not.
I'm telling the truth!

Girl, if you don't get up out
of here with that devilment,

I mean, you better get to steppin'.

I'm telling you. I'm going to bed.

'Cause after 10:00, strange things
start happening in this house.

Strange things.

No. I ain't gonna even be
able to do this.

I can't I got...
That's gonna blow my high.

High... You smoke marijuana?

I got a prescription!

You, little girl,

Mabel, I gotta get outta here.
I'm scared, and I gotta

get outta here, now!
Calm down, Bam. Bam!

Calm the hell down.

This girl is lyin'.

Don't let the ghosts get you.

Be on outta here.

She lyin'. Hold on!

What? Oh.

[all screaming]

I'ma fuck you up!

What the hell was that?

I'm sorry.

What happened to the lights?

Help me, Jesus.

That was Mr. Wilson.

You ain't doin' nothin' but lyin'.

Hell, that was just...
That was just...

That was just...
That was just power...

Power... P... That was just...
That was just the power acting up.

Okay, well, goodnight.

Okay, okay.

Calm the hell down.


Tiffany, come on!
It's time to go.

Shh! Don't wake the old people!

Okay, gonna fix the bed.

What are we doing to the bed?

We're gonna make it look like

Oh.

Yeah, like a body.

Okay.

Wait, over there. Here. Okay.

That looks like you been eatin' good.

Wait, hold on.

Okay. Let's sneak down the back stairs.

Oh, I don't know about this.
Come on.

Close the door.
Okay.

Good Lord.

Hmm.

This damn girl has snuck up

Bam, y'all ain't gonna believe this.

Y'all ain't gonna believe this at all.


That girl has snuck up
out of this house.

Uh-uh.

Yes, she did.

Well, where's she going to?

Probably over there to that frat party.

I knew it.

You talkin' 'bout over there where

Hattie...

Let's ride.

Come on, Joe.

No, you go on, I'm gonna stay here

Hey, hey. Hey, come here, come here.

The Lord gonna bless you, you share.

You make me so sick!

In that case, you gonna be payin' me.

Is it like that?

Go ahead on, then. I'll be here,

Prayin' for her safe return.
That the Lord will bless her.

Hey, I need a lighter!

[muffled music playing]

Wait, Mabel, stop it!

I know, I know, damn well...

Let's get out of the car here.

Damn! What, it backfired.

You know my brakes is bad, Hattie.

Hey, what the hell does that mean?

Uh... Lord, have mercy.
Look at these children.

Hurry up, Bam, get out the car.

Look at this.
Look at this.

Girl, leave...
Hattie, leave them children alone.

What, Ma? You know I don't mind buying

Well, somebody gonna throw

Leave these little boys alone.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Duh!

And they're wrinkly.

Up under the face!

You ain't gonna find her up

Barn, you been drinkin'?
No, I didn't find her.

And they got this rap...
I can't stand this music.

But, Mabel, if you can't stand it,
why your body...

Why your body moving like that?

That's that ho, that's my bottom half.

Every time it hear this music,

That's the ho from back in the day

Yeah.

[sing-songy]
I don't like this rap.

I don't like this.

<i>â™ª Hey, put your hands up!

<i>â™ª Hey! Put your hands up!</i>

[Barn] Wait a minute.
Hold the hell on.

I just unplugged the damn music.
And I'ma tell you right now.

Let me make this very, very, perfectly
clear to all of y'all up in here.

I have been nice,

Y'all better present Tiffany.

You got 32.1 of a second

I don't give a damn if Tyga upset here.

I don't give a damn...

<i>Throw her old ass out!</i>

Come on, let's go to the damn house.

[indistinct chattering]

All right. She's gone.
Will she call the police?

No. She's got lots of warrants.
She's crazy but she's not that crazy.

Look, Tiff, we love you and Aday, but...

We just don't like the drama.

Well, I'm sorry that my dad is so lame.

Well, we just can't hang out
and have this happen again.

Well, it won't happen again.
I promise.

This is why we said that,
you know, you shouldn't come.

It's 'cause your dad's
gonna flip, dude.

And, you know, now Jonathan is missing
his party, it's kind of unfair.

Yeah.

Well, don't worry about Jonathan.

I'll make it up to him.

Oh. All right.
Okay.

Mmm-hmm. Okay. All right.
Have fun.

Bye.

Listen, I'm so sorry about all of this.

Yo, Tiffany, it's all good,

but are you sure she's not
gonna call the police?

Yeah, I'm sure. I'm surprised
they even left the house.

I was telling them this story
about how the house is haunted.

Oh, you should have
seen their eyes.

They were, like, scared.

Really?
Yes.

Oh! All right. Tell me more.

Oh, Lord.
I think I want to go home.

Yeah, me too. Home run.

Knock you out the park.
I'm talking fifth base.

Is there even a fifth base?
What is that?

What are you freaking out for?
Come on.

I'm not. What do you mean?

We'll get weird on each other.
What do you say?

I'm just 17.

You're 17?
Yes.

Years old?

Yeah.
In human years.

Yes.


This girl is 17!
Seventeen years old!

[Dino howling]

I'm mad as hell.
I'm mad as hell!

Gonna throw me down in them bushes,
and Bam, you sitting there,

sitting there getting' high
with them damn boys.

And Barn, you wasn't even
gonna help me?

You supposed to be fightin' for me.
Y'all was supposed to have my back. Oh!

Mabel, I got your back.

I always have, always had your back,
but I'm high, Mabel.

Somebody needs to call the police,
that's all I know.

Somebody need to call the po-po.

You so damn worried about her,
you call 'em.

Hell, I'm trying to sleep.

Oh, no, I can't do that, I got warrants.

Mabel, call them anonymously.
That's what got me in trouble!

Because anonymously is how
I was writing them checks

and dealing with them
credit card frauds. I can't do that.

Somebody else got to call 'em.

I can't call them neither, Ma.
They know my voice, too.

Well, you know damn well
they know mine.

Ma, why don't you just go
describe your voice?

Do what?
Describe your voice.

The word is not "describe," honey.

If I describe my voice
then they gonna know it's me talkin'.

It is "disguise."
And I can't disguise my voice.

Because they have voice
data recognition.

I'm on the terrorist list, too.
I'm on terrorist watch.

They recognize it.


I'll call 'em, hell.

How much damn stuff
you got up in them breasts?

I bet you take all that stuff
out and breasts is just flat.

Barn, you high,
what you gonna say before you call 'em?

Uh... Yeah!

Wait a minute, hell,
you gonna call 'em like Lil Jon?

No, I'm gonna call 'em
like a little white girl.

Oh. You a little white girl?

Barn, you ain't never been
little in your life.

And she never been white, either.

What you gonna say when you call 'em?

Yeah, listen, we need the police.

I'm being held against my will.
Help me! Help me!

Ma, it's something wrong with her.

Really, really wrong.

Barn. Listen to me, honey,
make this perfectly clear.

Just call the people and tell them...
Listen to me.

Just tell them that an underage girl

snuck out the house and she at
a frat party. Don't do all of that.

Okay, Mabel.

Yo, stop, stop!
Pull the rip cord, bro!

What the hell, don't you knock?
Look, somethings wrong with Aday,

she just ran out of here.
Where did she go?

I don't know!
Well, what happened?

I told her to get the hell out.
She's 17.

And so is this broad fraud right here.

Are you crazy?
We could all go to jail!

Hold up, she's not 17.
Does this look like a 17-year-old?

Are you 17?

Yes.
Oh!

Tiffany, that's just...

Tiffany, that's just wrong!
I know. I'm sorry.

No! We can all get kicked out
of school for this.

I'm sorry!
Wait, how old are you guys?

Eighteen.
Eighteen.

Cool, cool.

All right, all right,
I need all the illegals

to get out of this frat right now.

Go. There's the door.
Guys.

The cops are here.
[guys groaning]

All right. All right, listen.

Everybody out. Take her out
the back door and try to find Aday.

Come on, Tiff.
Outta here. Let's go, go, go.

Out of my way, peasants!
I ain't going back. Go, go!

What's up, Officer?
My name is Jonathan.

The <i>El</i> Presidente
of this here fraterni-tay.

How can I help you?

Party's over.
Everyone clear out of the house.

Present IDs. Now.
[Dino] Hey, hey, hey.

You got a warrant, hot shot?

You want me to call the dean
and wake her up?


That's what I thought.
Everyone, clear out!

Party's over, now.

All right. Everyone out!

Party's over.
Lamest party ever.

What a bummer.

[siren wailing]


Did that really just happen?

Man, it was lit.
You really leaving?

I don't play with po-po.
We out, homie. All right.

Tyga, no.Tyga.

This sucks.

Hey, you know it was them geezers
that called the police. You know that.

Oh, I know.

We can't let 'em get away with this.

You know, it was our own fault,

they shouldn't have been here
in the first place.

Would you mind shutting up?

This is not our fault and I refuse

to let some old people
deny this frat's reputation.

What are we gonna do?

Oh, we're gonna get so even, fellas.
Here's the plan.


Madea! Madea!

[Madea] What the hell?
[Bam] Mabel!

What's this? Lord, have mercy.

Hattie, what the hell wrong with you?

I think I heard somethin'
scratchin' up my wall.

Girl, go on with that, hell.

I think it's that man
that killed his whole family.

I think it's Mr. Wilson, Ma.

Hattie, calm the hell down, ain't no...

[loud banging]

What the hell is that, now?
What the hell is that?


It's him, Ma,
I ain't ready to die, Ma.

Listen, listen, would you hush?

Ain't no ghosts in this house.

Ain't no ghost gonna be
knocking on the damn door.

Does that make sense to you?
A ghost that damn knock on the door?

[scoffs]
That's crazy as hell!

Bam, go open that door.

I know you ain't sending me
to that door.

Uh-uh.

You scared, Mabel.

I ain't scared of nothin'.

Go open the door.
Go open the door, Mabel.

I'm tired right now.
Uh, Joe, open the door.

Hell, I ain't going to that door,
this ain't my house.

I ain't goin' nowhere near that door.

Go on and get it, bruh.
[loud banging]

What the hell?
Oh, no.

Hattie, what the hell is it?
Oh, no, Ma.

What is it, Hattie?
You see somethin' scary at the door?

What is it?



You see white people?

[both screaming]

Girl, that's the po-po, here.

Hide the stuff!
Get the stuff...

Oh, hell, I ain't got nothing.

We ain't got nothin' to hide.

That took me back in the day when
the po-po used to come round here,

and everybody would be
just duckin', runnin'.

Them was the good old days.

Oh, man, please.
I got a prescription, I'm good.

Okay, well, Bam, go open the door.

Why I gotta open the door?

'Cause you got a prescription, you good.
Go open the door here.

All right, all right.

Well, did you check my dad's room?
Because that's where I was.

Why would you be up in his room when
you supposed to be in your own room?

Well, sometimes my room gets cold.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

You lyin'.

Like I said, the closer
it gets to midnight,

And you know

That happens.

Okay, well, I'm gonna go

Come back here, honey.
Come back here.

Where is Aday?
She's asleep.

You are lying to me,

Okay, well, me and Aday

That's him! That's him.

Girl, what the hell going on

And they say it gets cold when he's mad.

Mabel, she better stop this, Mabel.

She better stop this, I'm not playing.
She better stop this.

Girl, get the hell on

Well, it is kind of shitty in here.

I was in that bathroom

and the water wouldn't go off.
Get up.

Mabel, I'm not playing with you,

I looked in the mirror, Mabel,
and there's something wrote,

"Get your fat ass out of here. Or die."

Mabel, they're talking to me.
Y'all believin' that girl?

That ain't nothing but Joe

No, Joe's downstairs.

He's still downstairs.
He's sitting in that chair.

He's still sitting in that chair.

He's still... Yeah.
Where he was before?

Y'all go to bed.
Stop acting like y'all scared.

Ma, don't try to act like
you ain't scared.

You scared, ain't you?
I am not scared.

[Barn] Mabel...
Honey, I'm not scared.

Mabel, why are you up here in this bed?

With your good running church shoes.

Mabel, you got every light on in here.

I was reading.


I was trying to read the Bible.

You weren't reading no Bible, Ma!
Where is the Bible?

It's on the table in my heart.

Mabel, we gotta get out of here.

[all gasping]

Okay.

[Hattie] Yeah.

Did she say he was in the attic?
Get the hell on up out of here!

Y'all get the hell up out of here!


Y'all know I can't
run down these stairs.

What the hell?

Now, Joe, stop playing games
on these old ladies up there!

I ain't playing no damn jokes.
I'm playing with myself.

Joe, I know it's you.
I know you're down here doin' it.

Look, everybody out here out of breath.
Can't breathe at all.

Bam tired running down the stairs.

Damn, you out of shape.

How the hell you get this out of breath
running down the stairs, Bam?

Now Joe, stop it.

Now, y'all come on, we only got
a few more hours to be in this house.

Now, come on, let's go on
up there and go to bed.

[loud crashing]
[all gasp]

Madea! You heard that, Ma?
I heard hollering like a damn fool.

Ma, I know you heard it upstairs.
No, I didn't. I didn't hear nothing.

Yes, you did, Ma. You know, they say
that's where he killed

his whole entire family,
up in the attic.

Joe, you see these ladies is worried.

Get up and be a man and go on up there
and check and see what's in the attic.

Bitch, please.

Mabel, come on, take me home.

Hey, I'll take all you hoes to a hotel,

if you hoes don't tell.

Shut the hell up!

Ma, go on up there

I ain't scared.
Okay, great.

You bad.
I'm bad. Who's bad?

I ain't scared of nothing!
Okay, great.

The hell I got up here

I don't know what's going on up here.

Okay, great. Bye, Mabel.

Okay, great.

Bye, Mabel.
Okay, great.

If she don't come back I just

I wanna go home, Mabel.

I ain't scared of nothing.

I ain't scared of nothing.

I ain't never been scared of nothing.
I've been big all my life.

I had to be brave.

All my life I had to fight.

I ain't never thought
I'd have to fight in Brian's house.

Ain't nobody up here.

Nobody. Ain't nobody up here.
Hey, ain't nobody up here.

[wind howling]

[metal clattering]

I don't see nothing.

Yeah, ain't nothing up here.

Got all these crazy-looking costumes
and everything, ain't nothing up here.

[floor creaking]

[shallow breathing]

Damn clown was back there.

I know the damn clown did not just
move from where it was.

[roars]
[screams]

Madea, you think she's all right?

Ain't nothing to worry about.
[Madea screaming]

What? What?

Oh, Jesus. Ma!

Mabel, are you all right?

I thought there were a herd of buffalo
coming down the damn stairs.

Shaking up the whole damn house.
Dea, what happened?

We got to go to my house.
We got to get the hell up out of here.

I thought you'd never ask!

Yes. Yes. Let's go.
Ma, let's ride!


What the hell is wrong with you, Hattie?


Ah... Look!
I don't see nothing!

I'm not gonna fall for that.

There's a clown.


Yes.
What'd he look like?

Oh, a dirty-looking clown.
He's a crazy-looking clown!

I saw one upstairs in the attic, too.

I'm looking at three damn clowns.

Put y'all three side by side,
you shaped like a one-oh-one.

Get the hell on up out of here.

Joe, I'm telling you there's
something in this house.

I gotta get out of here.

We got to go.
We got to go.

I don't see nothing. He gone.

Yeah.

[both scream]
Mabel!

I'm getting ready to choke
the hell out of her.

I'm gonna punch her dead.
Mabel.

Hey, girl, I'm getting ready to clog
your esophagus. Shut up!

It moved!

What the hell is wrong with you?
It moved!

Yeah, if something is behind me...

Mabel. Oh, Lord!

Get in my car! Get in the car!

Open my door! Y'all know

Mabel, be careful!


Why we just sitting here?
I forgot the keys, girl.

Ah! Hotwire it!

Barn, what kind of lady
do you think I am?

I'm a lady, I don't know
how to hotwire a car.

Who the hell do you think I am,
some kind of common criminal?

Well, that's all you had to say,
I got you on that, Ma.

Me too, girl, you know I know how...
Wait! Wait!

Are we just gonna leave the girl
in the house with the clown?

right now, that's Joe's grandchild.

I ain't got nothing to do with her.

She already got a nasty attitude,

it's every clown for himself.
Hotwire this.

[electricity crackling]

[engine starts]
[both scream]

Oh, Joe, don't do that!

The hell?
Joe, what the hell is wrong with you?

<i>Hey.</i>

The hell is wrong with you? I was about
to bust your face with this damn gun.

I don't know where the hell
you think you're going.

You left these in the house. You left
your purse and everything up in there.

Here.
Give me my keys.

Where are you going without them?

I don't know.
[man on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

And this phone of yours

Hello?
I was up in there...

Burning up your minutes
and somebody's on the phone.

<i>- Is anybody there?
Who is it on the phone?</i>

It's some preacher on the phone
working on my nerve!

Hell! Preacher. Pray for that.

Here.
[Madea] What?

Leave me the hell alone.
I'm going to lay down.

[cell phone ringing]

Who is this?
Don't answer that, Ma!

Mabel, don't answer that.
I saw it in a movie.

When you answer that thing,
the little girl...

When she answered the phone,
she got dead.

I remember that.
She said "Hello" and that thing said,

"Are you in the house alone?"

I remember that.
Yes.

Don't answer.

It's all right.

Don't answer it!
Don't.

Don't answer it.
[man on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

But I hear somebody.

<i>- Is anybody there?
You say there's somebody...</i>

Who is it?
Who the hell is it?

<i>- This is Reverend Walker.
Hey, Reverend.</i>

Hello, Madea.
Reverend, look here.

If you calling to pray for me,
I ain't got no time for that right now.

Well, a little prayer would be good.
Bam, hush.

Okay, go and pray, Rev, go and pray.

No, she's not. No.
She's not?

<i>- You need to come to the church.
Okay, fine.</i>

<i>- Come on down to the church.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

Madea. Now, Madea, <i>come on...</i>
Well, what the Rev want?

That girl snuck out of this house
and went down to that frat party.

That damn Tiffany done lied again!

The Reverend want me to come over to
the church so he can talk to me.

That won't be a bad idea at all.

A little prayer won't hurt
nobody right now.

Barn, I'm not going up
in there for no prayer.

I'm going up in there
to set this straight.

This child, she gonna need
more than a little prayer.

She gonna need the damn clown
and everything in there to help her

when I get back here,
I'm telling you right now.

'Cause I'm not gonna deal with this.

And Mr. Wilson and a clown, that's
gonna be the least of her worries.

Well, wait a minute, Ma, we just gonna
leave the girl up in there, right there?

What the hell else we gonna do?

I'm not going
back up in there to get her.

[tires screeching]


What the hell?

Coming up here with that bullshit.

Go on, clown, go on.

[floorboards creaking]

[wind whistling]

Ain't nothing over there,

There ain't nobody in here with me.

[exhales sharply]

That's what I know.

[floorboards creaking]

[shallow breathing]

Like that?

Yeah.

I did that already tonight.

[Barn] Mabel!
[Hattie] Yeah.

You wait till I get back home,

That's crazy <i>as</i> hell.


I'm gonna fix her though, she's...

That clown gonna be the least of
her worries when I get back there.

[Bam coughing]

Let me look up under the hood.

Ma, we gonna wait right here for you.

Hattie, get your ass out of the car,

Mabel, I'm not getting

Come on, help me open it.

Ma, we caught here

Come, help me open the hood, girl.
Oh, Lord.

Help me open, you've got to pry it up.

Come on, on the count of three.
Count of three. Look. One, two, three.

Whoo! Yeah!

When's the last time
you had this thing serviced?

1972, when I bought it.

[animal howling]

What's wrong with it?

We don't know, Barn, hell,
we just got out the car!

The hell's wrong with her?
Ma, I'm scared out here.

You scared in the house,
you scared in the dark, hush.

Ain't nothing out here.

No, you know I don't like to be out here
in the dark in these here woods.

Nothing wrong with these woods,

hell, ain't nothing out there.
Hattie, just hush.

Shh!

Is everybody all right?

Barn, we fine. Hell, we fine,
would you please be quiet?

Damn, what the hell wrong with her?

Mabel.

I hear something out there.

You don't hear nothing, Hattie. Hell.

Look, is this the carburetor?

I don't know nothing about
working on no car.

[low growling]



Madea!

Oh, jeez! Oh! Madea!

What the hell's wrong with you?

Madea!
What? What you running for?

[growling and snarling]

Oh, hell, Oh, hell. Hell!



Madea!

Madea!
[Bam] Hattie!

Mabel! Mabel! Wait for me!


Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!


Help me, Jesus!

Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

Help me, Jesus!
[door opens]

I need Jesus!

Oh, Lord, somebody help me,

I just need Jesus,
come, somebody pray for me.

What'd I do, what'd I do?
Somebody just needs to pray for me.

Oh, I need Jesus! I need...

You can't smoke in here, Madea.

Okay, but didn't Moses
have a burning bush?

I need the lamb of God.

Would you like to be saved, darling?

Oh, yes, I wanna be saved,
will that help me?

Oh, praise the Lord,
Hallelujah, that's wonderful!

Now do you believe that
Jesus is the son of God?

If I have to, that's what
I'm gonna believe.

Just, I just need y'all to help me.

And you confess your sins?

Up in here with all these
children up in here?

Honey, you don't want me confessing
my sin up in here around these men.

I'll have all of them blushing.

You don't know what I used to
do back in the day, baby!

Wasn't no fun. Bam! [laughs]

Pray for me.

not to anybody in here, but to Him.

You just confess with your mouth
and believe in your heart,

and you shall be saved,
it's that simple.

Oh, just like that
and all my problems go away,

ain't gonna be no more demons
following me and there's monkeys

and everything walking behind me?

Well, getting saved doesn't mean
all your troubles won't come,

but it'll help you when it do.
I'm a living witness now.

I confess that Jesus is son of God.

I believe. Sha-na-na!
Yes, I believe, help me.

Am I saved? I'm saved now!

Yes...
Yes, I'm saved!

Yes, praise the Lord, I'm saved.

[applause]
Yes, Hallelujah. Thank you.

Them demons that I keep seeing
and monkeys and clowns...

They've been following you. I know.

[Madea sighs]

Reverend, you anointed just like TDJ.

How you know that, Reverend?
How you know that?

Uh... Aday told me.


Baby, you got the gift like Joel Osteen,
you got the gift, baby?

I have a confession. I...

We snuck out of the house
and went to the frat party.

I'm so sorry, Madea.

I already asked the Lord
for forgiveness.

But when you came
to the party and shut it down,

the frat guys got so mad.

And they wanted to prank you.

They hacked into the TV.

The lights. The plumbing.
That was all them.

I heard them talking about it
when the police came to shut it down.

And when you were in the car
and the zombies came out of the woods,

that was them.



Come on, get some holy water. Come on.


Jesus working on her,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Now hold that.
Hallelujah, Jesus.

No, no, them words is about to come
out of my mouth, but I'm in a church!

Come on, now, hold it. Hold.
You better...


Oh, Lord.

Sorry, these words trying to
come up out of my...

Don't cuss, Madea, you in a church,
hold yourself. Don't cuss.

I bind you, cussing demon!
Bind him.

Cussing demon, I bind you!

You trying to tell me right now,

that that was them children
that did that?

To me? And the clown?

That was them.
And the movement in the attic.

I'm sorry, Miss Madea.

You ain't nowhere near
as sorry as them

frat boys about to be
for what they done did to me.

No, no, Miss Madea, Tiffany has
some responsibility in this, I'm sorry.


I'm going over there and I'm gonna burn
that place down. I'm going right now!

You just got saved, Miss Madea.

Sometimes getting saved
is like a bad perm, Reverend...

[male voice]
It just don't take.

[normal voice]
Now where them boys at?

I'm going over there
to get them right now.

Uh... Uh... Miss Madea...

Reverend, I know
you ain't grabbing on me.

I know you ain't...

Do you want them holy hands?

Do you want your holy hands, Reverend?

I think you just need to calm down.
The Bible says to turn the other cheek.

Yes, but the Bible
talks about these cheeks.

What about the cheeks
down at the bottom?

Those are the ones I'm going after
'cause I'm gonna tell you right now.

What they done did is just absolute,
flat-out wrong.

I'm going over there and set it off.

No, no, no. Miss Madea,
there's gotta be some other way

to teach them a lesson.

[Hattie screaming]
[crowd gasping]

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Ma, you ain't had
to leave us like that.

I know y'all knew where to come.

They came straight to the church,
didn't they?

Listen. Hold on. I just
found out what happened.

It was them frat boys, but listen to me.

I got this. Rev, you might be right.

There might be something
we can go over there and do

and get all this straight.
Yes.

I got... I got an idea.

I'm going to try something
very different.

This is what we gonna do...

I oughta bust you...

believe this.

You ain't gonna believe
what them frat boys did.

Yeah, I know everything.
I know everything, look here.

I... Hold the hell on.


So y'all wanna play games
with old people, huh?

What is your name, son?

Urn, I'm Renaldo,
but everybody calls me Horse.

Horse? Ooh, can I ride?

Hattie, please, damn.
Hattie, hush.

one more time, Hattie,

you keep talking to him like that,

you ain't getting no more
of this damn donkey.

So y'all like to play games, huh?
What is wrong with y'all?

I'm sorry, we don't wanna get
kicked out of school, please.

You worried about
getting kicked out of school,

you about to get your ass kicked.

I'm gonna get all this
straight right now.

Y'all wanna play these games?
I'm calling Brian.

I'm calling right now.
Yeah.

<i>[Brian]
Madea, how you doing?</i>

Brian, you ain't gonna never believe
what your daughter did.

I need you to come home right now.

<i>Madea, I don't...</i>

I don't care what you're doing,
if you don't get here right now,

you ain't gonna have no house.

Yes, we gonna get it.
No, I'm good.

Right now.
<i>Okay,</i> great.

And then she just snuck up
out of this house.

That's exactly what she...
Snuck up out of this house, Brian.

I cannot believe that...

I think that you need to just
shut the hell up and listen, boy.

Right. You need to get that girl to
come down here and put your foot down.

Okay. All right.
But what do I say to her?

You grab her by the throat,
you say, "Look here, you little..."

Daddy, if you say something
bad about my daughter...

Joe, don't you call that child
no bad name, hush.

Call her.

and set this thing straight.

Get this child in order,
she is running all over you.

You need to get her in order.

Okay. Tiffany!
[Tiffany] What?

Honey, can you come downstairs, please?

What the hell you doing?

Boy, what the hell wrong with you?
Call her from your nuts.

[Bam exclaims]

Well, now that may be how it sounds,
Joe, 'cause, he only got one.


Boy, I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

You're sitting here
like a little me-otch.

Stop using that language
in my house, okay?

Listen up, everybody here.
I'll try this my way,

and if it doesn't work,
then I will resort to 1938,

where you beat the hell out of your kids
and everything was okay.

All right? I'll get arrested.

I'll have warrants.
I'll be like you guys.

I'm running from the police.
I'm running from the po-po.

I don't live that way.

Nigga. Nigga. Your way ain't never work.

We trying to tell you the way
we did it in the old school.

All this new shit ain't working.

That's why all these children
killing each other.

That's why all these children
ain't got no respect for nobody.

This new shit don't work.

Tiffany!

Tell her you better get your ass down
them steps right damn now.

Get down these stairs right now,
your dad would like to talk to you,

have a conversation about some of
your behavior, young lady.

Find your way down these stairs,
right now.

Look, she's coming. See? Duh.

What?

Girl, did that child say, "What"?

Oh, somebody help me,
y'all better hold me.

Somebody better hold me.

Tiffany, hear me clearly
and answer this question, okay?

Be very careful with your answer.
All right?

'Cause your life may depend on it. Um...

Did you sneak out of this house

and go to that frat party
after I told you not to?

So What if I did?

I told you not to go.

Mmm. So I did. Get over it.

If you don't snatch that heifer up
by her new growth and sling her

through the air like
a helicopter, you better...

Where are you going,
I'm talking to you.

I'm done talking to you.
I'm going back to bed.

Oh, my God.

Jesus, fix him.

Okay.
[blows raspberry]

I tried, that's it, I tried.

I did what I could do.
Our turn.

No, no, hold on.
What're you gonna do?

You tell her,
"Baby, if you think you're grown,

you're gonna have to get your ass
out of here and go get you a job."

Don't no child supposed to be up in
your house talking to you like that.

The house where you pay all the bills.

What the hell is wrong with you

letting this child talk to you
like that? She got to...

[male voice]
She got to get her ass...

[normal voice]
She got to get her ass out of here.

I am not putting my 17-year-old daughter
out of the house on the streets

so she can do
all kinds of criminal things.

She's not gonna grow up like you.

She's not gonna grow up like...

Other people have done.
I'm not doing it.

What's the worst that
can happen to her?

Turn to prostitution? Drugs?
End up in the bus station,

some pimp pick her up
and put her out on the street

pimping her out for years?

Hell, how you think I met your mama?

You can't put her out?
Oh, you can't put her out?

Oh, oh, you can't.

Is it too tough for you
to put her out?

You're such a nice man,
you can't put her out.

I'll put her ass out.

And me, too.
They swigging on

testosterone and all them...
Y'all go on, go on. Come on.

Come on, y'all come on.
Let's go. Move!

Wait a minute, what are you doing,
what are you doing with my daughter?

What... Hold on. Just...
What are you gonna do

when you get up here
is what I wanna know.

[indistinct shouting]

turn them on right now.

Get your tail up out of that bed!

What the...

Go ahead! Finish your statement

so I can bust your head
to the white meat.

Yeah, that's right,
she's gonna bust it to the white meat,

and I'm gonna bust it
to your damn cranium.

Say what you was about to say.

Let them words fall up
out of your lips, little girl.

Oh, no... No, what are you
doing with my stuff?

No, no, these are not your things.
Your things is what you go in the store

and you pay for with
your hard-earned money.

Your daddy bought all this stuff,
so don't none of this belong to you.

This is called borrowed stuff.
Rented. Do you understand?

This don't belong to you.

Oh, I like this right here!

Oh, yes, I love it!

[Madea] You can have it.
No, you can't, that's mine!

Oh, try to take it. Try to take it.

I wanna see her do that, babe.
Please try to take it from Bam.

Please try to take it from her.

What is wrong with you old people?

Say that one more damn time.

Your daddy works hard, day and night,
to buy all this stuff for you,

and you gonna sit up here
with all this attitude?

Baby, you got to go.
Go where?

I don't know but you've got to
get the hell up out of here.

Dad.
No, no...

He ain't gonna say nothing.
I wish he would say something.

Brian, say something, so I can
bust you in the back of your damn head.

Please say something to her.

I like this thing right here.

I can rock this
like the young people say.

I can rock these.

Where you going to rock it?
On your damn ankle, Bam?

Give me that damn
pair of pants, you think...

That is mine.

Try and take it from me.


Uh, don't look at me.

See, that is the problem.

Okay, you're always
letting people run over you.

You let Mom run over you,
you let her husband run over you.

You let me run over you.
[Madea] Uh-oh.

There it is. I knew she was
angry about something.

Something hit that nerve.
There it is, what happened?

Your morn did not
run over me, Tiffany.

Oh, so her having an affair in this
house isn't her running over you?

Brian, I believe that's
running over you, right there.

I believe that's running over you.

You know about that?

Of course I know about that, okay?

Do you know that Morn
has no respect for you?

When are you gonna start
standing up for yourself?

You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

I'm gonna start standing up for myself.

Right now. Right now.

Pack it up.
Yep!

Everything. Let's pack it up.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

That's it, Brian.
Pack her stuff up. Pack it up!

Okay, this has to be a joke.

No, I'm not joking at all.
I'm telling you right now.

You obviously know everything that
went on between me and your mother,

you know everything that happened.

Forgive me for trying to
protect you and your brother

from what was going on.

From trying to protect you from the pain
that was happening in this house.

Listen to me. It takes a stronger person
to leave a situation

than it is to stay and fight
in a situation that's not worth it.

Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Obviously you don't.

So you clearly don't appreciate
anything that I've ever done.

So it's time for you to go.
You got to go!

Go where?

I don't know.
But it's obvious you're grown.

You can make your own decisions.

If you cannot abide
by the rules in this house,

then you are not allowed here.
Do you understand?

Don't cry. Tiffany,
I can't do the tears.

I'm not gonna do the tears.
I've had enough of this.

I've had enough.

Okay.

I love you.
Do you understand that?

But you have to abide
by the rules in this house.

If I say it, you have to abide by it.
Do you understand?

I know you're a teenager. I know that
a lot's going on. And listen to me,

I want you to go out
and live your life.

I want you to make mistakes.

But I don't want you
to make any mistakes

that's gonna cause you
to ruin your life.

You shouldn't have gone to that party.

Anything could have happened
to you over there.

I'm not trying to run your life.

I'm trying to protect you
as your father.

And if you cannot understand that,
then you have to go. ls that clear?

Okay.
So tell me right now.

Are you staying in this house
and abiding by my rules

or are we all gonna
put you out of here?

I'm staying. I'm listening to you.

Apologize.
I'm sorry, Dad.

Mean it.
I'm sorry.

I still think you need to whoop her ass.

One good time.


Little girl, let me explain
something to you, honey.

That's what parents be trying to do.
Set you on the right path.

Parents aren't perfect.
They make all kinds of mistakes.

And when you start trying
to make them perfect,

you mess up thinking that they are.
They are not God.

They are parents.
And they try to do the best for you.

And you sitting there
and I know you're mad

at your mama for what she did

and you're mad at your daddy
for him not standing up.

All that is clear, honey.

But what you need to
understand about that is this.

Forgive your mama, forgive your daddy,
for the things they didn't know

and you help them figure it out.

Since you wanna act like you so grown.

You understand?

Yes.

And I'm gonna tell you right now,
I'm mad as hell at you

for letting them frat boys come up
in here and trick me up in this house.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


Uh-oh. That's the po-po.

I know the po-po knock anywhere.

It probably is.
Lord have mercy.

Well, Brian. Go open the door.

Yeah. Of course you want me
to get the door.

I'm the only one without a warrant.

We're not done talking.
[knocking continues]


But, Brian, I've got a prescription.
I'm still legal.

Let's go see what's going on.

Yeah. Who is it? Officer.
What's going on?

We need your daughter, Tiffany.
Tiffany? For what?

What is going on?

What'd you do?
I didn't do anything.

You know Aday Walker?
Yeah.

When was the last time
you talked to her?

Um, last night.

She was with you at the frat house?
Yeah.

Wait a minute, what's going on?
Come on.

No, no, no, no.
Until you tell me what's going on,

she's not going anywhere.

Sir, this girl is missing.

What?
And we need to find her.

Her parents are worried sick.

Go on with them.

What? Dad, no!
Yeah, go on with them.

I'm right behind you, okay? Go on.

Go on.
Dad.


You gonna put handcuffs on her?

I'm right behind you,
let me get my keys.

[knocking on door]

Go home! Come back next year.

Peasants, the party's over!

[officer 1]
Police! Open up!

Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.

What do they want?
What do they want?

What do they want?
We don't know.

Dino knows. It's about that 17-year-old
charlatan from last night.

You shut up, Dino.

Clean up. Clean up.
Put it in the basement.

[indistinct chatter]

[knocking continues]

[officer 1] Police! Open up!

[knocking continues]

[officer 1] Open up! Now!

What's wrong with you?
[Horse] What?

Talk.
[Horse] Spit it out.

Go. Go.


Come on, cops again?

[officer 1] Open up!
[Dino] Worst party ever.

Let's get out of here.
Go. Let's go, let's go, go.

[knocking continues]

[officer 1] This is your
last chance to open the door.

What the hell?

She disappeared last night.
Nobody saw her?

Dino. Dino. Dino. Dino.
No. No. No.

Dino! Dino!

This dude was with her.
No! Nothing.

What'd you do?

<i>[door slams]</i>


Police! We got a warrant
to search these premises.

Everybody outside.
Handcuffed. Let's go.

We didn't do anything.
Let's go! Let's go!

Everybody outside.

[officer 2] Come on.

Keep it moving.

[officer 3] Rain Matheson,
Leah Devero. And she was here.

And she's underage just like this girl.

You know that.

Did you bring those girls up here
and you knew they were underage?

No, no. We just invited them.

But we didn't know their age.

We didn't know anything.
Yes, you did.

Both them girls
know damn well she is underage.

She underage.
And you took her down to that party.

That's right. That's why
you're in trouble right now.

No.
Stop that damn lying.

You've been friends with her
since y'all was in the fourth grade.

How the hell you ain't know
how old she was?

We swear. We didn't know.
We didn't know anything.

It was them. I saw it.
Shut up, Jonathan.

We found a body in the basement.



We are waiting on the medical examiner,
but you can identify the body.

See, that's what your daddy
was trying to tell you, honey.

This is what I was trying
to get you to understand.

Your parents ain't lame
'cause they tell you not to go out.

Not to be texting and driving.

All that stuff is bad.
Y'all kill people.

And now this girl is up in there dead.
She is dead. She dead.

Y'all are under arrest
for the murder of Aday Walker.

[all pleading indistinctly]

It was them! It was them!

Dad, I'm sorry. Dad, help me.

Listen, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

I didn't do anything.
I will do my best to get you out.

I don't know if I can, but I'll try.

[male prisoner 1]
Big, strong boys.

Hey, yep. Y'all finna get it. Yeah.

[Jonathan crying]

[male prisoner 2]
I like the cryin' baby.

[female prisoner]
Who is this?

[Jonathan continues crying]

Who cryin'?

Homie, you gonna hug
a man from the back.

Nothing wrong with that though.
Good hugging in the shower.

Soap flying everywhere.
So romantic.

[whimpers and cries]

So you killed her
and you crying about it?

We didn't kill her. I promise.

There's a dead body,
you're on the bus with us.

This is messed up, bro.

Hold tight. Be quiet.
And we'll be back.

These are your new friends.

Ain't gonna be no more
frat parties and stuff.

'Cause y'all killed a girl
and you're going down for it.

Who is this?

[officer 3]
Treat her nice. She is a minor.

But those two, they are 18.

Who?
No, we're not. No, no.

No, no, no. That's not us.

I sure would like to
twist your hair, girl.

No, no. I don't like braids.
[Leah] Me either.

They're not a cute look.

My hair doesn't twist, I swear.

It's just really straight,
and, like, bendy,

and it's really not cute on me.

[female prisoner]
Well, you can twist mine, baby.

No, no.
Our manicures won't let us twist.

They'd get caught.
I'm sorry, miss. Uh...

My name is Walter.

Oh, my God, this just
keeps getting worse.

Wait, wait, wait.
That's my momma and my daddy.

Momma, daddy.
No, wait, wait. That's my sister.

You killed my sister!
No, no, no. They're black.

They're not even related to you!

[people screaming]

Lord have mercy.

Ooh!

Hey, baby. Lord have mercy.

How did I do as a cop?
You did all right, baby,

but I don't want you to have
to run after nobody here.

'Cause I don't know if you
gonna be able to keep up.

You know damn well I ain't the police.
I couldn't be the police.

I know. Hell, your record
longer than mine.

You calling me
'cause you're getting robbed,

I might rob your ass, too.

I ain't the real police.
[Madea laughs]

[screaming continues]

I want that little Jonathan to see

what it feel like
to get pranked by somebody.

Since he always doing all
the damn pranking.

[growling]
[chuckles]

They're touching me. Please!

I don't know, guys.
This is just wrong.

Look, come on, now, Madea,
this is enough. Let's help them.


Maybe you better watch out
for that little one.

He look like he getting ready
to get raped for real.

Go and get 'em off the bus.
He'll be all right.

Go and get 'em off the bus.
But take your time.

Hell, I'm enjoying this!

[bus honking]
[officer 3] Y'all, sit down.

All the little killers, come on.
Y'all come on.

Aday, come on out here, baby.
Rise from the dead.

Jesus, say Lazarus, please come up.

Coming, Miss Madea.
Thank you!

Hey, she come up from the...

Did good with that makeup, girl.
Just all bloody.

Come on, keep walking.
And hurry up.

Oh, no. Shh, shh. Here they come.
Here they come. Stand there like Carrie.

[Jonathan crying]

[officer 3] Keep walking. Come on.
Don't say nothing. Keep walking.

See, no... No hugs necessary.

[Jonathan] I love you so...
Just keep walking.

You are so wrong for that.

I know. But I'm alive.

I know. I'm sorry. So sorry.

I'm so glad to see you.
Don't do that to us again.

I hope you learned your lesson.
I hope all of you learned your lesson.

This is just wrong.
Trust me, sir. We did.

Well, Miss Madea, I'm sorry
we pranked you and...

You get my point for the prank?

Trust me, your prank,
we get it now. We get it.

Good. Okay, good.
Thank you so much.

So, how do you know
all those guys in there?

All the people came from
my neighborhood. All of 'em.

That's all my people from my hood.

How did you get
all these fake officers?

Hell, Brian know
a whole bunch of people.

That's how I got a fake officer.

You know I don't mess
around with no real officer.

Oh, no, Madea.
Those aren't fake officers.

They're not fake officers.

Those are real officers.
Who do you think I am?

Federal prosecutor.
I brought the real officers.

Say what?
Those aren't fake officers.

These the real police?
Yeah.

Real po-po? One time?
Yeah.

Okay, I can handle this.

Oh, shit.

Wait, so all the officers
in our house right now are real?

Now there's nothing in there you
have to be afraid of, is there, son?

We found marijuana in the house.

You ain't got no prescription.
You ain't got no prescription.

Hey, don't I know you?

Let's ride.
[shrieking]

I know I know you from somewhere!


Madea!
Hey, where you going?

He ain't gon' never catch me...

That's the way to get rid of them.
Come on, let's go home.

[Barn] Madea! Madea!
I'm sorry.

You are learning.

Madea, come back and get me!

I remember I was sitting there
trying to teach you how to read.

And I told you to use the
word "bishop" in a sentence.

And you said,
"The bishop was at the church."

I said
"Boy, that ain't what that word means."

Then you got mad at me
because I was telling you

what the word really means.

Then you say
"Daddy, use it in a sentence."

So I use it in a sentence for you.
This is what I say.

"Bishop", this is what it means.

"Your mama came in the house
drunk, falling down

and I had to pick the bishop."

Whoop that ass.


We going. Hold on here.
[Bam] Mabel!

[Barn groans]
That's all right.

This son of a bitch gonna
start one of these days.

Madea!
[engine turns on]

Got any oil in there?

That's all right.
I got everything in here.

Don't look like you got
no gas because we still ain't left.


Yo, man, wait.

Remember that time.
Y'all got to stop laughing.

You all over my lines.
Stop jumping my lines.

Who the hell is that
up there walking for real? Now hold on.

Hold the hell on.
[people laughing]

Hold the hell on. Who's upstairs?

I told Kanye I could've rapped with him,

he wouldn't let me
go on the road with him.


You see, I'm on the canes now.
Yes, I see it.

Yeah.

Hell, I'm killing the cameraman.

All of them got carbon
monoxide poisoning by now.

Here we go.

You got to go home.
After I'm done.

I ain't doing all that
cuddling and holding,

acting like I like you.
I ain't finna do that.

I wanna be in my bed by myself.

Thank you. I'll see you later.

Your 20 dollars is on the dresser.

Look at...

I ain't gonna tell her what happened.


Do you know what a ho is?
No, you don't. Be glad.

Well, you do. Well, your mama.
Your mama was a ho.

But that's all right.
That's all right.

God gotta make room for everybody.

Yeah, when she died I had to bury her
on her belly to give her ass a break.

'Cause she was just worn out.

But last year I was actually a ghost.

Wait, you just said
you don't celebrate ghosts.

Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

[all laugh]

Can somebody just be on a script?

See, we've said some things twice.

Yeah, I've been telling them
that she went down there to the doctor.

And the doctor told her
that she can't have sex for a while.

That's what the doctor told her.

I said, well,
"What did the dentist say?"

It's too late for this shit.

[continues laughing]
