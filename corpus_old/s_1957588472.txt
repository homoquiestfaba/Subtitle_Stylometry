[Dad's voice] <i>I hope you
never have to hear this tape</i>

<i>as that means
we've left the farm.</i>

<i>We moved here to this land to keep you
safe and to help your mother get well.</i>

<i>She isn't getting better.</i>


<i>I fear she's getting worse.</i>

[cricket chirrs]

[door bangs]

Come on,
let's check the traps.


I've got your coat.

Right here.

Shhh.

[grass rustles]

[dark eerie music]

â™ª

[birds sing]


the first trap, okay, Solomon?

[birds singing]

[metal clanking]


[slight clanking]

Hold on.

Drop it in.

â™ª

[light clanging]

â™ª

â™ª


Go on.

â™ª

â™ª

Be careful!

I'm sorry, Mother!
What did I do?

Nothing.

Never mind.

Okay, cut her in half.


Good job, Solomon.

You've learned well.

Okay, now take one.
Mm-hm.

[gentle clacking]

[bird calling in background]

Excellent.
[sniffs]

Okay.

Where?

â™ª

Good, go ahead.

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

[insects chirring]

[door squeaks]

He's not jumping anymore.

How long have you had
him in there?

Mm... Mm?


Creatures can't survive like that. They need
to be able to breathe and eat and drink.

You know what today is?

What?

your father's birthday.

Oh.

I thought maybe
we could go fishing.

He loved to take you fishing,
remember?

We could bake a cake.
How's that sound?

Really? Okay!

Well, then come on.

[dark eerie music]

â™ª

[eerie vocalizing]

â™ª

[bird caws]

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª


Nothing. Why?

Where did the animals go?

You're very observant,
aren't you?

I guess they went
to find their own food.

Maybe they thought
we were hunting them.

Or maybe they're as observing as you
are and they went to warn the fish!


[water lapping]


What happens when we... die?

Why are you thinking
about dying?

I don't know.

Is that just like...
the end?

Oh, no, it's not... It's not really
the end. It's more like a change.

What kind of change?

Well.

You know, when a caterpillar
turns into a butterfly?

It's sort of like that.

Life goes on
but in a different way.

Listen, you don't have to worry
about that right now, okay?

You're young
and you're strong

and you're going to be
around for a long time.

You know, I think we might
have better luck catching fish

if we had real worms instead
of these plastic bobbers.


Here! Hold this for me.

Don't go too far!

[water trickling]


â™ª

â™ª

[water rushing]

[gentle thuds]

Solomon?

[metal clinks]

â™ª


Solomon!
Ah...!

Not to go too far!
What are you doing?

I... I was trying to find
big ones.

Here. I'm sorry.

All right, sweetie,
those are big worms

but we are done fishing
for today.

We need to leave now.

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª



I got one.
[Mama] Oh, sweetheart.

Good job. Keep going.

Millie.


How did you get loose again?


I'll be right back.

Come on, Millie.


[low melancholy music]

[lighter flicks]

Shall we sing
"Happy Birthday"?

<i>â™ª Happy Birthday to... â™ª</i>


No, I just thought
it might be nice.


Okay, well...

maybe you just want to make
a wish and blow out a candle.

It's right in front of you.

[large exhale]

[clapping]
Yay, Solomon.

What'd you wish for?

I can't tell you.

Hey! Cut it out!



I love you so much!


[wind howls]

[thunder rumbles]

[cassette clicks]

[Mama's voice]
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

<i>near a tiny village
beside a tiny bay,</i>

<i>there lived a baby goat
in a tiny woodland, far away.</i>

[man's voice] <i>Mama goat and
Papa goat loved their baby so.</i>

<i>They nurtured him
and kept him safe</i>

<i>and watched him
bloom and grow.</i>

[Mama's voice]
<i>Then Mama would sing a lullaby</i>

<i>to help him fall asleep</i>

<i>while Papa rocked him in his
arms and Baby counted sheep.</i>

[man's voice]
<i>On and on, it went this way</i>

<i>as baby goat grew old.</i>

<i>He never wandered
far from home</i>

<i>always doing as he's told.</i>

[Mama's voice]
<i>Until one day</i>

<i>he ventured off
roaming far and wide.</i>

<i>Climbing up and over hills
and down the other side.</i>

[man's voice] <i>Past the stream,
into the woods</i>

<i>where the canopy turns black.</i>

<i>Further,
deeper and darker he went</i>

<i>until it was time to go back.</i>

[Mama's voice]
<i>"But which way to go?"</i>

<i>he wondered aloud,
unsure of how to get home.</i>

[baby goat bleats]

<i>"What have I done?
Where have I come?</i>

<i>And just how far
have I roamed?"</i>

[man's voice] <i>Frightened and
crying and turned all around,</i>

<i>that's when he heard it,
a terrible sound.</i>

[Mama's voice booms]

<i>A trumpet of [indistinct].</i>

<i>Or is it teeth?</i>

<i>Slouched and crouched
and hungry for meat.</i>

[man's voice] <i>Baby goat ran
with furious speed.</i>

<i>Out of the woods,
over the stream.</i>

[Mama's voice] <i>Over
the hills and down the path,</i>

<i>closer and closer to home
at last!</i>

[man's voice] <i>Where Mama
and Papa held him tight,</i>

<i>loving him and hugging him
with all their might.</i>

[Mama's voice]
<i>"You scared us!"</i>

<i>They yelled,
"You can't run away!</i>

<i>We love you and need you
and want you to stay!"</i>

[man's voice] <i>Baby goat cried,
hugging them back</i>

<i>and promised
to always be good.</i>

<i>And always he was
and never he did return</i>

<i>to the darkened wood.</i>

â™ª

[thunder rumbles]

baby goat made it home, okay.

Me too.

[cassette tape clicks]

from that terrible noise!

He sure did.

Solomon?


You asked me earlier,
what happens when we die.

You said we change

but I don't understand
about the butterfly.

That's okay.

No one does, not really.

That's what faith is all about.

Faith?

You remember
when Millie got really sick

and I said
she might not make it?

"She might die,"

but I said, "No way!"

[giggling]
And you were right.

She got better.

That's what faith is about.

It's when you believe in
something that you can't prove.

You believe in it anyway
even though you can't see it.

I think that's your gift,
Solomon.

I have faith in a lot of things

because I can't see anything.

You are a good boy.

[gentle smooch]

Good night.

I love you.


Hmm?

I have faith in you.

I have faith in you too,
Solomon.

<i>Solomon.</i>

<i>Solomon, I am so sorry.</i>

<i>I have to leave you now,

Stop. Easy, kid.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

No.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. You're bleeding.

Now, I'm just trying
to help you, kid.

How are we here?

Your rope.

I figured you must have
something important attached.

Wasn't expecting a house.

Didn't want to lose it?


Where are your parents, kid?

Anyone else around here?

â™ª

â™ª

I'm fine.

I'm not... I'm not kid.

'Course you're not.

I apologize.
You don't seem like a kid.

My name's Hank.

Where's my rope?

Rope's right here.

I'll pass it to ya.

Is your name Lucas?

How do you know Lucas?

I don't. I just saw
his name on that knife.

Is it Lucas's knife?

It's mine now.

Well, what's your name, then?

â™ª

Solomon.

Hello, Solomon.

It's nice to meet you.

Please don't stab me.

Here's your rope.

No one answered
your door earlier.

Is anyone else
coming back here tonight?

I'd be more than happy to

finish helping you
clean up that cut.

Give you a couple aspirin, in
exchange for

a place to stay 'til mornin'.

Aspirin?

Yeah, aspirin.

You don't know what aspirin is?

No.


to make the aches
and pains go away.

Trust me,
you'll thank me for it.

I don't need your help.

I can see that...

but I need your help, Solomon.

I'll be blind in them woods
when that sun go down.

And I don't
have a rope like you.

But I have a deer.

I could make us both dinner.

Uh...

I'll take that as a yes, then.

Mind if I sleep in here
by the fire tonight?

Okay.

Hey, Solomon.

If you want to go with me
in the morning,

I could get you
somewhere safe.

I just mean,
I noticed you were running low

on canned food and I could...
No.

Okay, fine.

I just wanted to offer
some help.

I don't need help.

I love your home, too.

And I wouldn't want
to leave it either.

Hey, uh, I noticed the picture
of your mom and dad.

You know,
you look so much like your mom.

I mean, just like
your dad, too, but...

so much like your mom.

I loved her.
[Hank] Mm.

I'm tired.

Sure, of course.

I'm beat too.
It's been a long day.

I'll clean up.

Let me get a flashlight.

â™ª

Where are you going?

To see what that was.


Stopped what though?

I don't want it startin' again.

What are you gonna do?

Depends on what it is, I guess.

You just stay here.

I'll be right back.

A'right?

[owl hooting]


[shrieking growl]

[fast ominous instrumental]

Solomon?

Do you know what kind

[hums anxiously]

Do ya?

I thought somethin'
was gon' kill me.

Tell me if you know what it is.


Whatever it is,

it was big enough
to kill a bear.

I mean, it wasn't a huge bear,
but it was a bear and bears...

It's okay, Solomon.

We're safe now.

I think.



â™ª

How the hell
am I gon' get you outta here

with that thing in them woods?

[Solomon humming]
[sighs]

It's nice.

That song.

[delicate classical
instrumental]

[music grows darker]

[wood clatters]

[outdoor din]

Hey! Good morning!

Thanks for letting me
stay here last night.

Do you know anything about
what was out there last night?

You know...

there's a...
lot of deer left over.

I was just thinking I could

show you how to preserve it.

Have a little deer jerky
around in the winter.

Looks like you got
a old smoker right here.


What happened to him?

He left.

I'm sorry, Solomon.

Well, I see a...

lot of materials around here.

We could build a new one.

And grate,
some metal stakes.

Yeah.

I think...

I can work with this.

Now, do you happen
to have a chain?

[eerie music]
Uh, I found one before.

In the woods.

But it's stuck.

Stuck to what?

I don't know.

Well, you have some
bolt cutters here.

Can you take me so I can see?

Yeah. I can...

I can check my traps.

â™ª

Clever.
[chuckles softly]

Ah, there's nothing
in your trap.

It's pretty amazing to me
how you move around so well

with your rope.

Mm. Rope is my guide.

It's around here.

Well, there's a whole heck

of a lot of
around here, Solomon.

You gon' have to throw me
a bone here, kid.

Oh, it's right here!
You were right, Solomon.

It's right here.
[chuckling]

Does look like it's attached
to something, doesn't it?

Let's see what it is.

I guess you're not coming?

No.

A'right, you stay right there.
I'll be right back.

[ominous instrumental]

Oh, shit!

â™ª

I don't know,
it goes into some kind of den.

I couldn't pull it out.

[Solomon] A den?
[grunts]

Some kind of hole
in the ground.

It don't really matter,
though, I guess.

We got what we need.

â™ª

Hey, uh...

Will the deer fit?

[laughs]
No, no,

we will have more than enough

left over to cook regular.

Yeah.

Can I have a piece?

Yeah. I just said
we have plenty.


A'right, now.

â™ª

What are you doing?

Hunt and scavenge
do it for two,

one for the forest
and one for you.

What the hell is that?
Witchcraft?

You always throw
dead animals out here?

Uh, yes.

Well, that explains
why some animal

was prowling around last night.

What say you and I go find out

what kind of beast that was
while it's light out.

I can't.

You won't... I'll be right here
to help you, Solomon...

No, Hank!

So you do remember my name?


Why? Can't lose the rope?

I can help you with that, too.

You just have
to trust me a little.

Whatever is out there
ain't gon' go away

if you keep feeding it.

We can set a trap for it.

I mean,
unless you just feel safe

all alone out here,
that's cool.

You probably right.
You got this under control,

all on your own.

How?

How you got it under control?

How can you help me?

[outdoor din]

[fabric tearing]

[Hank sniffing and exhaling]

just as safe with this.

It will just give you
a little more freedom is all.

And you don't have
to worry about my knots.

I spent the first half
of my life on a boat.

[grunts]
You hear that?

[Russian accent]
Strong like bull!

[normal voice]
Now feel it.

Yeah! America-made!

[Hank laughs]

[Solomon mimics Hank]
Strong like bull.

[Hank laughs]


'Kay. Okay.

All right, let me get
one more thing.

Come on. Let's go get
this sumbitch.

I got you, kid.
Hold on. Let's go.

[Hank grunting]

[tense music]

Uh, is this
where you seen it?

Yeah, well, somewhere
around here.

I don't think
it's around here now.

I hope not.

But between you and me,

I think we've reached
the end of our hope.


It's a joke.

Never mind.

Old man, knuckle sandwich joke.

Hank!




[Hank panting]

Come on,
let me get you outta here.

Let me get you home.
It's not safe out here.

Come on, I got you. I got you.

Come on, come on.

Follow me. I got you.
I got you, kid.

[eerie music]

We safe now. Don't worry.

Whatever that was
can't get in here.

That trap will get it quick.

You okay.

Hold on.

I saw somethin' last night.

Was your mother's name
Nye-dia by any chance?

Nydia.

Did you know
she wrote a journal?

What?

I found her journal.

"To the joy of my life,
Solomon."

And she signed it, "Nydia."

What does it say?

I don't know.
You want me to read it?

She had beautiful handwritin'.

"Sunday.

Happy birthday, Solomon.

I cannot believe
you are four years old today.

How have four years
come and gone so quickly?

I broke down in tears
last week when I realized

you were not going to be
three anymore.

I told your father
that I was heartbroken

because I could barely
remember you as an infant now."

[Hank chuckles]

"He got this journal
so I could

write down all of the things
we'd do together

and not forget.

He meant it as a gift for you.

But I think it's more for me."

[Hank chuckles]

"I doubt you will care
as much about how cute

your little fingers
are in the grass..."

[Hank chuckles]
"As you...

try to catch a grasshopper

or how your laugh
can pull me from sorrow

and transform me
back to paradise.

Your father and I
love you so much, Solomon.

Tuesday.

I couldn't understand it.
I was heartbroken.

I don't know why.

I just wanted
to keep you safe.

I think that's all
any mother really wants.

I told Lucas
that you belong here.

The ache for home
lives in all of us,

the safe place
where we can go as we are

and not be questioned.

I don't think he agreed
with me, though.

He can seem so different
from me sometimes.

All I have to do
is hold you close, Solomon.

You console my heart.

It dances in delight
when we sing together."


Just thinking of our lullaby

can sooth my soul.

I love you.
Good night, Solomon."

[eerie instrumental]
Hmm.

Here we go.

"Wednesday.

I cannot believe
he tried to take...

â™ª

What?

What is it?
Why'd you stop reading?

Um, it's getting really late.
Uh, that's enough for tonight.

No, please, Hank,
just some more...

How 'bout we get some shut eye?

Not tonight.
Okay.
