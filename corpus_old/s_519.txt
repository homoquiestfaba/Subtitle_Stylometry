Heinrich!
Turn off the airintake!

Stubborn bastards, those americans.
All ahead, 15 degrees starboard.

They're leaving.
They're leaving.

Periscopedepth. We'll teach them
who the stubborn ones are.

286 degrees, 15 knots.
Distance: 2700 meters.

Ready tubes 3 and 4.

Ready.

112 degrees.
Torpedo ready?

3 and 4 ready.

Ready.

Fire.

Yes! We got her!

We got her!

A good yankee is a good yankee.
We dive.

How is Heinrich?
Concussion. He'll be okay.

Good, I'll check in on him later.

Good move.
You always win anyway.

Do you know what your problem is?
My queen is in a bad position.

You always underestimate yourself.

You should have been a commander yourself,
instead of hanging around me.

I thought that you would be more cheerful,
after we sunk that cruiser.

We sink one, they sink 30.
We're lucky, that the torpedo exploded.

The Americans joined the war.
It didn't go so well last night.

It'll all be better soon.
With a little luck...

With a little luck,
we'll make it home in one piece.

What is it, Bauer?
Look at this.

Allways when you least expect it.

How many moves do I have left?
Two.

Chess...

...mate.

Good, I hate chess.
I get worse for every move.

Sorry to disturb you, Captain.
We're finished.

We got a message...
from home.

Give it to me.

Jonas, what does it say?

I need a moment alone.

They bombed Hamburg.
His daughters school is completely destroyed.

No survivors.

Torpedoes... Fire.

We have to surface.

Jonas, It's night.
We have to surface.

Yes, prepare for surfacing.
Ready for surfacing.

We couldn't stop the bleeding
in the brain.

How old was he? 18?

Heinrich wanted to show
what he could.

From the first day.

You couldn't do anything.
You couldn't stop it.

No...

That's the problem.

Captain...

Glenn Miller?

Good.

Torpedoes!
Damn!

All Ahead full. Dive!

Where the hell is he?

Två subs.
One of ours and an american.

Distance?
4000 meter.

She's right in front of us.
Distance 400 meters. Fire!

Follow me. Now!

Come.

Move!

Move it!

You're not scared of a few americans?

I'm worried about supplies.

We'll be at the supply wessel in a week. We have enough supplies.

There's nothing to worry about.

When we get there, we'll turn
over the americans for interrogation.

Klaus, could you give us a moment.

As you wish.

What is it?

You said it yourself - the war is ending.
Why risk everything now?

Make sure my orders are followed, Ludwig.

Yes, captain.

Why the hell did he bring them onboard?
There are rules in war.

Not when they just sunk one of ours.
The entire crew were killed.

Our Comrades!
Are you questioning him?

I don't doubt the captains
orders. Neither should you.

He puts us in danger.

That's what war is.

Eat.

They don't understand a word.

Here you go.
I hope you like it.

Leave it.

Chain them, and give him medicine.

Let him die.
Do as I say!

Take his handcuffs off

For him.

What are you looking at, Rat?

Not only are you eating our food,
I also have to look at you.

Thats enough.

I hurt everywhere
and it's difficult to breathe.

I'll give to something for the pain. Get some rest.

You'll be well soon.

How many?
Eight sick. Others have the symptoms.

Captain, come here, please.

We're almost there,
but the supply vessel isn't here.

What do you mean?
They aren't answering to our radiosignals.

Are we in the right position?
Yes.

Damn! Up periscope.

An american destroyer. Damn!

Distance?
2500 meter2.

2500.

Captain?

What's your command?
We must act.

How many torpedoes do we have?
Two front, one stern.

Ready one and two.
Set torpedo depth at 5 meters.

1800 meters.

Otto, Come here.

Torpedoes ready.
Ready.

Now!

Torpedoes ready.

The americans escaped!
I told you it would happen!

Cooper!
Nej!

Stop!

Dive!
Deapth: stern minus 20, bow minus 30.

Quick!
Everybody to the front!

Hurry! Quick!

50 meters.

Back!

We have to get rid of the americans.
Here? A mass execution?

I want to get rid of them as well. But we
can't get rid of the bodies.

I can live with the smell.

What is it, Bauer?
There's something you have to see.

Wilhelm was the first to
get the symtoms. Here.

The americans are like the plague.
And we have them here on board.

The crew must not know.
What? But the americans...

That is an order!
And you will obey.

Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus,
until we can surface.

The americans can't have any.
Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus.

Ja, Captain.
How long are we staying down here?

As long as we can.

Is she still there?
Perhaps.

"Perhaps" is not good enough.

Ready to surface.
We'll be an easy target.

What would you prefer?
Dying here or up there?

At least we have a chance up there.

Surface.

We're clear!

Transmit emergency signal.

Family?

Yes, my son.

Never forget this is the enemy.

Take care of your own men.
Out.

Eat!

And?

Every second is precious.

We must do something about the americans.

Take off his handcuffs.

That is all.

That he's speaking to them - that alone
is treason.

You've seen how he behaves.
He's insane.

This is insane.

What do we do?
I refuse to obey him.

I hope
that you won't either.

Jonas!

You can't just surrender.
It's my duty to save the men.

Don't surrender us to them!

We can manage without them.
If only we could.

Ludwig!

Your name is Hans, right?

Go to hell.

Have we surrendered captain?
Shut up! This is my boat!

I make the decicions.

We won't make it home, not in this boat.

If you want to die, we all die.

But if you want to make it back home alive
this is our only chance.

Come on!

Ahead, half speed.

Confirm course.

285.

All ahead, full.

We must do something.

Stop at once!

You will get what you deserve!

Whats happening?
We're being attacked. Hurry!

No, leave it.
Put down the phone.

The torpedo will explode! Are you mad?
You can ask the captain about that.

Go up there. Go!

Put down the gun!

Hands up!

Traitor! I will not let
you surrender the boat.

Are you going to kill us all?
I'd rather die with my honor intact!

No more talk now. The war is over.
Exactly.

Go to...!

Jonas!

It's your boat now

Get the crew home.

Damn.

If we surface, they can attack.

Prepare to surface.

Ready one and two.
Sink the traitor!

Fire!

All ahead, full. 110 starboard.
Torpedo three and four reload. Ready one for fire.

Fire!

Cease fire! Cease fire! There's germans on board
and we're in control.

Cease fire!
Prepare for combat.

Next time we're dead.
It's our countrymen.

They're going to kill us!

Ready three and four.

On my command, all ahead, full.

Dive!

Fire!
