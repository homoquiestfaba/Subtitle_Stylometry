Oh, son of a bitch!

Yeah, that's
me, Johnny Jones Junior.

As you can see, I love blow.
That big fat rail that just went

up my nose... it's just the
first of many for the day.

Make no mistake, coke is both a
requirement and a sin to boot.

But, I know right from wrong. No
one is perfect... especially me.

That's Rebecca, my hot Latina
girlfriend. Don't let the blonde

hair fool ya.. she's one
hot little chili pepper.

She's mi hermosa, mi amor.
(my girlfriend, my love)

Most importantly, she's mi vida.

Now in English that basically
means she's the love of my life,

the most beautiful
woman in the world.

We've known each other
since grade school.

We've been
inseparable ever since.

I guess you could say we
are co-dependent. All I know for

sure is, I'd die without her.

She's a little materialistic...
but most of the beautiful ones

are, right?

AAAAAA... MOTHER FUCKER!

That's my old man,
Johnny Jones Senior.

A real life
walkin' "talkin" satan.

Evilest man who ever
walked the Earth.

I often thought I saw horns
coming out of his head.

I have no idea why mom
stayed with him all

those years... I suspect
she was trapped by fear.

MOTHER FUCKER!

My sweet mother,
the salt of the Earth.

Not a mean bone in her body...
the most spiritual God

fearin' woman you'd ever meet.
I guess that's where I got my

calling... every Wednesday and
Sunday you could count on it,

we'd be sittin' in church.

Let me rewind this
back to the beginning...

Now that you know a
little about me... let's go back

to where Rebecca and I
decided to take a little trip

Westward...

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah.

Can I get an Amen?

Amen!

The Lord says let the sick be
healed, let the poor be rich

and let the broken
hearted be renewed.

Now I say to you
today, God's people,

if you are among the sick, if
you are among the poor, if you

are among the broken spirited I
want you to rise up and come on

down to the front with me.
Rise up I say in the name of the

Lord. Come on,
Jesus wants to heal you.

Be gone devil of illness he says
to one. May your cup runneth

over he says to another.
Be healed all of God's children.

Be healed and
renewed in Jesus name I say.

God is entering you now
brothers and sisters,

can you feel it?

Yes!

The devil
wants you to resist it, don't

you let him. Let the fire of the
Lord God almighty cover you in

the blood of
Jesus Christ the Messiah...

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!
Can you feel the healing that's

taking place in this
church today? I can feel it.

Sister, do you believe?
I want you to feel fire of the

Lord Jesus Christ blazing
through my hands...

Lord Almighty release
this woman from the bondage of

her chair. Put the fire of Jesus
in her legs. Lord hear me.

Heal this woman.
Thank you Lord, for all...

Now sister, trust in the Lord.
Everything will be okay, c'mon.

Lord has you.
Don't be afraid. That's right.

Oh Lord,
Witness brothers and sisters.

I'm walking... I'm walking.

Reverend,
you've healed me.

Oh, no ma'am, no ma'am,
God has saved you.

I'm merely an
instrument for the holy spirit.

A servant of the
Lord almighty. Praise God.

Did you see that God's people?

Amen!

Did you see the miracle of God's
glory that just took place right

in front of your very eyes?
Thank you Jesus. Praise God.

Praise be to God.

The healing hands of
the Lord radiate through me.

He strengthens the weak and
makes his people the meek.

He delivers us from all evil. He
is the rock, the rock of ages.

Praise be to Jesus.
Praise be to God.

Praise be to God.

Now I never like to close
without givin' thanks to the

Lord first, so as the offering
baskets are making their way

around today I want to encourage
each and every one of you to

give, and give again, and then
give just a little more until

your heart is satisfied because
remember what the Lord says,

the seed you sew today will be
returned to you 100 fold.

Blessed are the meek
who put their faith in the Lord.

Can I get an Hallelujah?

Hallelujah!

Let us pray...

May the love of God always
be above you, to overshadow

you, beneath you to uplift you,
before you to guide you, and

behind you to protect you... In
Jesus name, our savior, to whom

glory be now and
forever more, I say Amen.

Go in peace
brothers and sisters.

Oh... Son of a bitch!

Hey babe, how much do
you think we made off with?

Why you gotta say it like that?
You know that's how the Lord

provides, baby.

Looks like a couple of grand.
Should be enough to last us a

few weeks.

Why don't you count it yourself
if you care so damn much.

Puta Madre Johnny! Half of this
is gonna go up your nose.

You never buy me shit.
I want a new purse and some of

those new boots that all the
girls have been wearing...

you are so lucky that you have a
woman that puts up with

your shit.... Pinche Guero.

I tell ya what baby we're
headed to Albuquerque next,

stop at the mall or somewhere,
get ya whatever ya want.

But, I gotta make a
few more stops first.

A lot of good little churches
in this part of the country.

We should be able to
make out like banditos.

Hey babe, do you
remember my fifteenth?

Yeah, I remember the party.
Didn't your uncle get all

drunk and smash up the
piÃ±ata with a baseball bat?

All the little kids got candy,
he got a boot in the ass from

your daddy.

Ay, Teo Chewy.
He was my favorite.

He loved us kids. After my
father was killed, he looked

after me and my mom.
I will always love him for that.

Yeah, he was a good guy.

He lost his wife pretty early in
life and, and just... that drove

him to being a borracho.

Yeah, I get it.
I mean if I ever lost you I'd...

go crazy... just kill me.

I love you, mi amor.

I love you too.

How ya'll doin'? Come
on in. Don't be shy. Ma'am, there's a...

She's fine buddy!
Where you keep the agave at?

If you mean tequila,

it's right there in
the corner. You can't miss it.

I keep the pints back here.
I got some sales on half

gallons... douche bag.

Fuck me!

I got all you can handle.

Hey! What the hell you think
you are lookin' at? Huh?

You think I can't see
you eye fuckin' her?

You ought to take it as a
compliment... don't be such a

fuckin' hot head.

Aw, did you really just fuckin'
say that? You dumb fuckin'

You dumb fuckin' country rube,
I ought to come back there

and rip your fuckin' head off.

Come on...

Keep the change,
motherfucker!

Ya'll come back
now, ya hear.

Ah, shit. No fuckin' way.

All right, I'll be right back.

Good evening, my son. Your
vacancy sign is lit up brighter

than a Las Vegas Casino.

Good evening Father,
I can call you Father? Right?

I ain't a father in
the biological or the

Catholic sense,
but you call me pastor,

reverend... just don't call me a
son-of-a-bitch is all...

the wife and I need
a room for the night.

Oh, sure.

How much is that gonna cost me?

Just so happens that we
have our best room available.

And you know
what, just for you...

I can do a special discount
of thirty nine a night.

There's fifty and keep the
change. Why don't you keep the

T&A off your mind
while you are at work son.

I could see what you were doin'.

Don't you know that Internet
porno shit will rot your brain?

Keep it clean.

Might need a wake up call in
the morning, I'll let ya know.

Sure Father, uh,
Reverend. Room One.

Uh, Father... I was
wondering if you could help me

with something?

Sure my son,
what can I do for ya?

Look I... I know this is gonna
be strange coming from a guy you

just met at a motel. But you
know me and my, my old lady

we've been... we've been
fighting a lot lately.

I... If shit doesn't change,
I... I'm gonna lose her...

she's... she's gonna leave me.

Could you... pray for us?

You know do like whatever you
spiritual people do? Only if you

want to, Father. You know
what, I'm sorry, I'm way out of

line... I shouldn't have
said anything...

Give me your hand and bow
your head kid. C'mon... uhhhh,

other hand.

Father Almighty, come to
this young man in his hour of

despair, heal him and his lady.
Teach them the wisdom to act

together. Bestow upon them the
power of compromise and...

In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

Thank you!
Thank you so much!

If you need anything at all...
anything, just... just dial zero.

Go in faith son.... Go in faith.

What was
that about? I saw you in there

praying with that guy. Let
me guess, money problems?

Pobrecito. I wish we were rich
and we could help everybody.

Yeah,
it's just some a... poor soul

having trouble with his
girlfriend, asked for a little

help from above. And we are
rich. Alright, just keep saying

that. Speak words into existence
and one day it'll be true.

Just watch and see,
just watch and see.

We are rich.
We are rich.

God damn
baby can ya please just bring it

down a notch? I'm trying work
on my sermon. I need to

focus on this shit, please.

Shut the
hell up Johnny. You never let me

have any fun.
What's up your ass any way?

You ever get the feeling that
God's giving me a purpose?

Maybe God gave me a gift. That
woman... in the chair, she got

up and walked after I touched
her. I always think they're

bullshittin' but, maybe they
were all healed. I mean maybe

God gave me... a gift. When I
was a little kid I used to think

I could heal animals. Maybe even
raise the dead. Becca I really

think God's given me the power.

You know what I think? I think
you put too much of that shit up

your nose.

Yeah but sometimes it
seems like I will live forever

and sometimes it feels like
death is right around the corner

just waitin' to jump on me.

I'll never see it comin'. But I
do believe in life after death.

...Maybe you're right, maybe I'm
just going nuts but, am I crazy

for believing these things? Only
God knows the truth. It's not

like I'm first guy to ever
get the power, ya know...

Look at me
Johnny... I don't just want a

boyfriend. I want a husband. I
want a family. Whether you are

touched by an angel
or just an evangelist.

It doesn't matter to me.

I want to settle down. I'm
tired of this life on the road,

Johnny.

I know, baby.
In time. Princess, I promise.

It's all in good time.

You expect me to
eat this shit? You want mine?

Shut up! Shut up!

Hey, Hey!

It's me... Hey, it's okay.
It's me... you were having a

nightmare. It's okay. It's me.
Relax, it's okay. Nobody's gonna

hurt you. You're okay. It was
just a nightmare. Let me get you

some water.

Drink it baby...

It's okay....

You're fine.

Baby I've
been having these weird dreams.

I don't know how to explain
'em. It doesn't make any sense

and... and there's these other
dreams where its me as a little

kid with my dad.
I don't understand it.

Maybe you need to check into a
mental hospital or go see a

shrink.

Go see a
shrink. You fuckin' kiddin' me?

Are you even listening to me?
You understand what I'm talking

about? These dreams are drivin'
me fuckin' crazy. And look all

Are you listening? Come on!
Get dressed... Jesus Christ.

Are you going to tell me

Alright? I shot
a guy but he's okay.

Are you insane?
I, I pu, I put,

my hands on him and he healed,
okay? Healed 'em, and he walked

away. I don't know how... but,

We'll go get us some food...

Alright!... God damn,

Awwwwww!

Piece of shit.

Shut the fuck up, alright?

You shut up... I hate your face.

Hi, can I get you
something to drink?

I'll take iced tea,
non-sweet, extra lemon please.

I'll have a water, no ice.

I'll be right
back with your drinks.

You never told me
how you got the gun.

Was that a divine miracle
too, or did you lie to me?

I got it from a pawn shop, okay.

Alright?

I need a little
extra protection.

Speaking of which,
runnin' low on funds,

I got enough for about another
week, might have to sell my

watch. We need to
hit another church soon.

Order up!

Anything good in that paper?

Not unless you mean a
painter or a handyman needed...

Pinche Guerros are too
damn lazy in this country.

Let me see it.
You don't know where to look.

Ahhhh.

Pendejo!
Whatever, Johnny the Baptist...

Look... right there.
Big as fuckin' Dallas...

the Believers, apply in person

contact Mary O'Neal
in the church office, Monday's

and Wednesday's

That's us, bingo! The Lord
is on our side. He really is.

I hope you know that. It may
seem fucked up at times but,

He always provides.

Afraid I lost ya out on
the road back there...

Johnny what you said, it really
messed with my head.

I don't know how much
longer I can take this shit.

I'm starting to freak out, okay?
This fantasma cucu crap is esta

loco. Estas loco.
(is crazy, crazy)

I love you.

Tell ya what, I'll make ya a
bet. I pick out a song on that

jukebox and you get
up here and dance with me.

I never get to dance
with the girl I love.

And what is the bet?

Two pairs of boots...
instead of one, if ya dance.

You think I'm scared?
I'm not scared.

This Latina isn't scared of
shit. I will dance naked for

those boots.

Oh yeah?
Um hum.

Ya might have to.

This could be a big one
for us baby. We really need it.

Runnin' low. Wish me luck.

Okay, Okay Mrs. Taylor...
I'll get that out to you right away.

Oh, and God Bless.
Yes, uh huh. Bye Bye now.

Howdy Ma'am, I'm Pastor Jones.
My wife and I were having dinner

out on the highway last night
and we came across your ad and

thought we'd pay ya a visit.
Ya see we're headed out to

California to do the Lord's
work, a little church just North

of Fresno. We had a few days
free so we thought we'd stop by

and see if we could be of some
assistance to you and the good

people of the church?

Bless you, Pastor.
You said, Pastor Jones?

Well, Bless you too. Yes, that's
right, Pastor Johnny Jones.

Originally from the
Great State of Texas.

Texan, aye?
My daughter married a Texan.

Oh, that's a lucky lady.

Um, yes Pastor Jones our pastor
of 10 years took ill and died

last month. And we have been
without guidance for three weeks

now. The associate pastor has
been just overwhelmed. He's very

young. Hasn't even
finished seminary yet.

Well I just, I'm so sorry
to hear that, sister.

We would be delighted to have
you this weekend to lead us in

guidance and in prayer if you
could? The assistant has just

been booked with paying house
calls and doing the job of two.

I know that he would be
very happy to get a break.

Well he does the best he can
with his experience, ya know?

Sister O'Neal is it?

Oh please, call me Mary, Pastor.

Mary, I would be absolutely
delighted to lead the church

this Sunday. I... It would be
the least we could do.

After all a church in need, is
the Lord's church indeed.

We hit the jackpot honey...
house full of Baptist just dying

to give to the Lord.
We're on for this Sunday.

Maybe now I can get
my new purse and shoes?

Yeah, I'll get
your damn boots.

Ahhh... thank you God.

Hey honey, hurry up in there...
I gotta take a shit.

That burger
yesterday isn't sittin' right.

In a minute.

Jumpin' Jesus. Thank God.
I was about to explode.

Gross. Esta Cochino Marano.
(you filthy pig)

Hey honey... why don't ya pick
out one of your best dresses to

wear this Sunday?

What do you mean?
All of my dresses are cute.

Yea, I know but I... I really
want to impress these people.

Okay, I'll see what I can do.

Yea,
it could be a big haul for us.

Mmm, you smell good... why
don't you go pick out a dress?

Ahhh, yes.

Which one do you
think I should wear on Sunday?

Ahhhhh um...

Do you think we will ever get
married, Johnny? We've been

together forever now.
I'm ready.

Do you want to have kids?

You sure know how to end the
night, dont'cha? Look I promise

as soon as I'm ready for all
that, I'll let you know first.

I still got
my new purse and boots, right?

Yes, you get your new purse and
boots... because you're my

princess. But, right now
I needa little R.F.P.

What is R.F.P.?

Uh, Rebecca's
fantastic pussy.

Get over here.

Honey...

Hmm?

I'm gonna take the car
out for a few hours to get some

girl stuff.
Do you need anything?

No but, hurry up and get
your ass back here quick.

I gotta get my suit dry
cleaned for Sunday.

Okay, grumpy.
I'll be back pronto.

Bye.

Ay, ay, ay, ay,
canta y no llores.

(yes, yes, yes,
Sing and don't cry)

AHH! MOTHER FUCKER!

I told Little Johnny I don't
want that fuckin' dog in

the house.

That's enough.
Literally, tie it up.

Fuck... Shut the fuck up.

I don't give a shit.

Get away from me.

No, you come here bitch.

I hate you.

Where the fuck you going?

I'm just trying to
get away from you!

Okay.

Bueno? (hello)

Hey Mom, it's me, Becca.

Ay, Mija...
I've been so worried about you.

It's been like two weeks
since you've called me.

Donde estas, Mija?

I'm here in
Nuevo Mexico with Johnny.

Mija, El es el diablo.
(he is the devil)

Everything is going to be okay.

We just need some time.

We talk about marriage
and ninas one day...

Okay, mi amor... just take of
yourself. Promise me that,

if you need anything, that
you're going to call me.

Si Mama, I promise. Mom, I have
to let you go. I'm gonna do some

shopping. But, I love you, okay?

Okay, mi amor. Te amo. Te quiero mucho.
(I love you very much)

Bye mama, te quiero.

Adios, mija.

Hey Baby...
you get your beauty sleep?

Yea, I gotta get
my suit cleaned.

You get all your
ladies stuff?

I did. I also got my boots.

Whhhhaaat?

I saved you a trip to the mall.

Yea, I don't have to hear
about that any more.

I talked to my mom too.

How's she doin'?

She's fine.
Um, she's just worried about me.

Just being a typical mom.

God damn baby, I love your mama.
Sweetest woman on the planet.

Nobody's got a
bigger heart than her.

I guess I got her to thank for
your lovely personality.

And that's a turn on. You know
most guys got fat bitchy old

ladies.

Well mister, what if I turn
bitchy, fat, and ugly?

Ah, I don't see
that happening.

Ah, this piece of shit.

Ah mother... just needs a
little love. There it goes.

I'm tired.
I'm tired of this...

Yea, you know what?
I'm fuckin' tired too.

Well I just...
Stop talkin', fuck!

You know what?
It's none of your fuckin'

business how much
money there is left.

Why not?

Or what the fuck I
did with it, alright?

It is my business...
you're not doing shit.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

What are you doing in the middle
of the God damn fuckin' road?

Shit. Fuck.
Fuckin' insurance?

Well, Mister miracle man... are
you going to prove it to me now?

What are you trying to be funny?

What?

What about the bullshit...

...Shut the fuck up.
Just shut up.

Uh, fuck you!

Ah, God.
Heavenly Father, heal this man.

Descend upon this man's leg.
Heal his broken limb.

Put the fire of
Jesus in my hands.

Heal this man, Lord.
Heal this man.

I'm healed.

Just... just get out of here.

I... you healed me.
Here... just go, just leave.

Who are you?

Just get outta here!

You healed me.

I can't believe it.
You weren't lying to me.

I'm in love with a miracle man.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

How do I look?

You look a lot like the man that
fucked me twice this morning.

Yea, I bare a strong
resemblance, don't I?

Alright.

You ready?

Yea, I think so.

Let's do this.

Good morning,
how are you?

Good morning,
thank you for coming.

Good morning, Pastor.

Good morning,
how are you, ma'am?

I am just fine.
We are so happy to

have you with us this Sunday.
The ladies of the church have

made lunch for you all.
You will stay, won't you?

Well of course we will.
I would never turned down fine

home cooked meal.
So thoughtful of you

and the sisters.
I can't wait.

I have prepared my
special apple cobbler for you.

Aw, you are kidding me? I was
just telling Rebecca how much I

miss my mama's apple cobbler.

Oh! Excellent.

Good morning.
How are you?

Good morning.
God bless ya.

Good morning.
Thank ya for coming.

Good morning,
people of the Lord.

Good morning.

I was driving here this blessed
morning and I told my lovely

wife, Rebecca, how blessed we
were to be welcomed into such a

fine church and community. But
moreover, how blessed the people

here were to have had such a
fine minster for so many years.

Hallelujah! Amen!

Now I know Pastor
Mike is lookin' down

on all of us right now with a
great big smile on his face.

I'm Reverend Jones and I come
here today with one purpose and

one purpose only. And that
purpose is to share in the power

and the glory of the holy
spirit. Can I hear an Amen?

Amen!

Now I'm so often reminded of the
hardships that so many of us

face throughout our lives be it
pain and suffering, financial

troubles, or maybe the loss of a
loved one. But here's what the

Lord says:

"Seek first
the kingdom of God and his

righteousness and all these
things will be made unto you."

Let us not look at the sudden
departure of Pastor Mike as a

tragedy but rather as God's
will. He had bigger things in

mind for him.
Amen!

Amen.

Now I'd like for you all to turn
your Bible's to Malachi 3 10.

"Bring ye all the tithes into
the storehouse, and prove me now

herewith, so sayeth the Lord of
hosts. If I will not open for

you the windows of heaven and
pour you out a blessing."

Now I want you to pay attention
to that verse and see how the

Lord operates. See the Lord
says, if you bring a seed to be

sewn with your tithe. He in
return releases the blessings he

has in store for you.
Can I hear an Amen?

Amen.

See we believe in a Lord of
plenty not in a Lord of

emptiness. Amen.

Amen.

In order to receive God's
blessing we must all be faithful

to his promises. We all must sew
that seed when we open our

hearts to bring forth
a blessing unto Him.

Amen.

Amen.

Now as I look out into the crowd
on this beautiful Sunday, I see

a lot of tears. I see some
wheelchairs. I know some of you

are in pain and need relief.

So I'm gonna ask those of you
that need some healing to come

on down to the front and let me
pray for ya. Take a leap of

faith. Come on. Come on,
don't be afraid. Help the people

that can't get down themselves.

Don't be shy, God's waitin'
for ya. Amen. Come on.

Fire!

Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!
Thank you Lord.

Fire!

Hallelujah!

Fire!

Hallelujah!

My son do you believe
that you will see today?

Yes. Yes.

Do you believe in the Lord?

Uh huh.

Yes!
I can't hear you.

Do you believe in the Lord?

Yes. Yes.
Let me hear you scream it.

Yes! Yes, I believe! I believe.

The Lord almighty said
said let there be light.

The Lord said
let there be healing.

Fire!

Now son,
when I remove my hands,

you will be healed.

Do you believe in the Lord?

Yes! Yes! Yes!

What is it my son?

I can see. I can see!

Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound.

That saved
a wretch like me.

I once was lost,
now I am found.

I was blind,
but now I see.

Now I want to ask
each and everyone of you to sew

a seed with the
Lord in your hearts.

Help break down those walls
keepin' you from bein' healed or

gettin' those bills paid this
month. Put your trust in the

Lord that all your needs will be
met. He will not let you down.

We're going to go ahead and
pass around the collection plate

while the organ plays. God bless
you. God bless you all...

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

(sniffing sound)

Thank ya,
Sister. Thank you. Thank you.

Reverend Jones, I
just want to thank you for what you

did for my brother.

It was truly a miracle.
You have the gift.

I mean he's been
blind since the war.

It may be a gift. But, it's a
gift from God to your brother.

I'm merely an
instrument of the Lord.

So how
long are you in town Pastor?

I'm sad to say ma'am we
gotta get movin' in the mornin'.

Ya know, out to California to do
some more good work for the

Lord.

Church will be open up soon.

Oh, so what is the
name of your new church?

It's the Calvary Community
Church just outside of Fresno.

Um hum, um ma'am, this
cobbler reminds me

of my mama's. It's delicious.

Oh, you are too kind Pastor,
let me get you another piece.

After all, I did make
it special for you.

Bless you!

That was a close one, Mr. Jones.
You better be glad I was here to

save your culo.

Yeah, you're not shittin'
me. Ole' bag does make a mean

cobbler though. Here...

You think you will
ever get caught?

Caught?

What do you mean, caught?
The Lord's on our side baby.

Whatever, Johnny.
We're just a modern day

Bonnie and Clyde. Heck our next
home is just the next pinche

motel in the next
pinche little town.

I'm tired Johnny.
I want a home, I want a family.

I know honey. All that'll come.

All that'll come.

I promise but you
gotta stick with me a little

bit longer... we're almost
home free. Alright?

Are we almost there?

Yea baby, just a
few more hours.

Look, you see

Alright? Just hang in there.

Ah shit! What does this

Fuck. God damnit.

Becky, where's

In the glovebox.

And the gun too?
Ah, shit.

Alright, everything is
going to be okay... just be

cool, I'll talk us out of this.
We'll be back on the road in

five minutes.

How you doin'?

License,
registration, and proof of insurance.

I, uh... I've got my
driver's license but I'm pretty

sure I left my insurance card at
home... I, we definitely have

insurance no doubt about that.

I... what's the
reason for pulling us over?

Your tags are expired.
You know it is against the law

to operate a motor vehicle
without proper registration,

proof of insurance.

I'm a pastor and me
and my wife are on our way to a

revival... anyway you can
just give us a warning?

You sure you don't have an
insurance card in your glovebox?

Anywhere? An old one?

Ah, I'm, I'm
pretty sure I don't.

Why, Why don't ya check?

Officer I...

Sir, I can not let you leave
without proof of registration

and proof of insurance.

Go ahead and
check your glove box.

Wait...
Shit! shit, shit...

Oh my God! Why did you do that?

God damn...

Turn-a-round!

What do you
mean, turn around?

You can heal him.

I'm not going back there...

You're gonna let him die?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Turn-a-round, Johnny!

Shut up!

Alright, I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try.

Oh, please Lord, please Lord

Why do you keep
fucking up, Johnny?

I need ya to shut up

We'll be fine.

Police are investigating
the murder of a Quay County Deputy

Sheriff. While on a routine
traffic stop, Deputy Danny

Hernandez was shot at point
blank range by a gunman.

It is unknown who the
assailant is at this time.

But, police hope to learn more
after reviewing Deputy

Hernandez's onboard
police camera footage.

Fuck!

Alright, we
just gotta get to the border.

Alright, we'll get into Mexico.
Everything will be alright.

We'll be safe there.

We just gotta drive a little bit

I should've listened to my mom.
I knew this was going to happ....

Look at me. I love you.
Alright, we're in this together.

I'm sorry this happened, but at

in the court. Alright? So I

ditch the car.

Okay, genius... then what?

There's a little town about five
miles ahead... we're gonna walk

there, and get us a room... and
I'll go get us something at a

used car lot. We have enough
money for a cheap car.

You really expect me to walk
five miles in heels? Please.

Johnny, this is too much
for me. This is not okay.

Else you do this,
or life in prison.

Alright? I'm tryin' to get us
out of this shit. I need you.

Alright? Just hold on. Let's go.

Alright, grab our shit.
Take only what we need.

Reporting Live, from the Quay

thinking, God. Please spare me.
Please spare me and Becca please

God, please.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

We're in business baby. Got us

tires. Everything.
We are all good.

Let me guess... you got

Uh, not quite.
Here, take a look.

See, she's a beauty, right?

It looks just like
the other one.

Are you kiddin' that's a
classic. I told you it's got new

tires. It's a beauty. Hey,
you know I love ya, right?

Um hum.

Yea.

You know back
there that wasn't me.

As soon as we get to
Mexico we'll have a fresh start.

I don't think the cops
know what we look like.

Trust me. A little bit longer,
I'll get us out of this.

Lord's on our side, I promise.

I'm confused. This... tell me
everything is going to be okay.

I mean, Mexico... what
about my mom and my friends?

Look at me. I promise
everything is gonna be okay.

Alright, once we get down to
Mexico, and get all settle in

there, we can
invite your mom.

Ya know, it's not
gonna be forever.

Just till the heat dies down.
Three, may be five years max.

Okay, you trust me?

Startin' to run low on cash
again... I'm gonna have to head

out of here pretty soon, figure
somethin' out. Okie dokie?

Okie, dokie, pokie.

(water is heard running)

You know they're looking for us.
It's all over the T.V.

We're outta here
in the mornin'.

Three hundred miles to
the border and we're home free.

I need to call my Mom,
Johnny. What do I tell her?

Just be cool baby. Just tell
her everything is alright.

Tell her we're gettin' married.

That should change
her mind about me.

Do you mean that?
Do you really mean that, Johnny?

Or, is that the
yayo talking for you?

Baby, of course I mean it.
Soon as we get to Mexico, you

and I are gettin' married.
And live happily ever after.

You know, you never officially
asked me. But, I guess this will

have to do.

In a couple of days,
you'll be Mrs. Johnny Jones.

Don't have to fake it anymore
and can finally put a ring on

your finger.
Make an honest woman out of you.

Do you think if I died, you'd be
able to revive me...

like those other people?

Gah, why ya gotta say shit like
that? If anything ever happen to

you, it'd kill me. You're my
whole world, Becca.

You know that.

I'm serious Johnny.
Don't talk like that. Come on... just...

Do you think your gift only
works on certain people?

I don't know how it works,
it just happens.

It makes me feel weird
just talkin' about it.

Change the
subject, alright?

Okay.

What?
Here's one for you...

Never mind. It's a surprise.

What?

It's your birthday next week...
I guess I can tell you.

What does your
mom finally like me?

Unnh, unnh... Even better.

What is it?
Come on... spit it out.

You're killin' me.

Okay.

You're gonna be a
father, Reverend Jones.

Are you joking with me?

Are you serious?
Unnn, unnh...

Are you sure?
Yeah!

Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be a daddy.

You know how I went to la
farmacia the other day?

Yea.

Well, I got three pregnancy
test and they were all positive.

Oh shit... shit! Ahh, hoo, hoo,

I'm gonna be a daddy.
Holy shit. I can't believe it.

Thank you.
You're gonna be a great father.

Oh, my God.

Just think honey, in a
few days we'll be in paradise.

We'll finally settle down.
No more runnin' round, from town

to town. I think I'm gonna start
a mission. May just be a

missionary, I don't know. You
can finally teach me Spanish.

Just you and me, and the
baby makes three.

I'm down to my
last eight ball.

Once that's gone,
I'm done. I promise.

Straighten up, and fly right.

What is Mexico like?
You know my people,

are all from there.

Ummm... it's a lot like this.
Mountains and sunshine.

A bit of a slower pace.
People are really nice.

Spiritual. It'd be a good place
to call home for a little bit.

Do they have a mall?

I swear that's all you
ever think about. Jesus.

I have to look good for my man.
Besides, it's my way of dealing

with stress. And I'm gonna need
a maternity wardrobe soon.

Wow, I wish you'd find a cheaper
way of dealin' with your stress.

You're costing me a fortune....

I'm gonna go be alone
for a little bit, alright?

Get some God time.
Yeah

You be okay here for your self?

Um hum.

Hey.
Good morning, sunshine.

Ummm.

Come on. I'm starving.
Get up. I need coffee.

It's only 6:30. It's...
ten more minutes.

Come on. We have a long day
ahead of us. Okay, I need to

call my mom too.

Ummm.

Get up. Cranky.

Alright.

Gotta piss.

Hurry up.

Get ya anything else? Alright.

So where you
guys headed?

Mexico.

Mexico? Are you crazy? Those
border towns are more dangerous

than the middle east.
It's a battle zone down yonder.

I wouldn't wish that on
my worst enemy for even a day.

We got the Lord on our side,
mister. I'm a preacher.

Headin' down there to do a
little healin'. The sick, poor,

the elderly. I'm on a mission
of mercy you might say.

Shit. I mean, shoot,
Reverend. Well, you better hope

and pray God is on your side.
You know a couple went down

there a few weeks ago... they
haven't been heard of since.

Rumor has it that
they've been kidnapped.

Being held for ransom.

We'll be careful. Can you uh...

wrap this up? Tryin' to get
out of here before it gets dark.

Yea, it's a two thirty five.

Hey, uh Billy, might
want to check your toilette.

Every time I flushed her down,
the water came right back up to

the top.

Uh baby, I'm gonna
wait for you in the car.

I'm not feeling well.

Alright.

Why is it every time
you come in here and take a dump

you have to stop
up the toilette?

Now I'm gonna have to go back
there and snake it again.

Yea, yea, yea, yea...

Can you wrap this up?

Let me get your
change, Reverend.

Uh, Mike this gentleman
here is a preacher.

No kiddin'.

Yeah, he's going to be going
South of the border.

I was just explaining to him
about the drug cartels and all

the kidnapping that's been
going on down in Mexico.

Oh, Mexico. Yea. So, uh,
where ya be comin' from, uh

Preacher man?

Texas. Uh, sorry... Arizona.

Huh, why you comin' through New
Mexico if you're going down to

Mexico?

Becca! Rebecca, what the fuck is
wrong with you? Come on!

Sweet Jesus. What the fuck did
you do? Come on. We gotta go.

Oh God. Come on.

Shit, shit, shit. I just don't
get it Becca. I don't understand

what the fuck just
came over you.

You just blew
those people away.

I'm sorry.

We're so screwed.

I, I didn't want to be a single
mom. I got scared, Johnny.

Well just... next time

shootin' people. Fuck!

Ba..., Babe...

the next town? I need to use the
restroom and I wanna call mi

to her. It makes me feel better.

Yeah, I guess.
I just.. gotta keep

this car outta sight, honey.
We're, We're fuckin' wanted now.

They got us on camera now. This
is it. There's no turning back.

We only got about
fifty miles to go. Shit.

I miss my mom.

Fuck. I know baby.

I'm a killer now. I'm no better
than pinche Charlie Madson.

It's Manson baby. Manson's a
psychopath. You're...-

you're nothing like him. You're
trying to protect us. I get it.

I understand. God'll forgive
you. I forgive you.

You just can't do
shit like that.

Promise me that we're gonna
raise our baby to be good.

And not like us. I'm ashamed of
the things that we've done.

I promise baby.
Everything is gonna be okay.

We're gonna make it.

Hola!?

Hey mom, it's me Becca.

Ay, mija, why haven't you called
me? I've been worried sick.

Mira, mama. Solo dispongo de un minuto.
(just needed a minute)

I just wanted to call and let
you know that I'm alright.

Mija,
I'm just worried about you.

Please, please come home.

Look, Mommy, Johnny and I
are going to Mexico.

We're going to start a family.

I can't tell you
a lot more than that but I

promise as soon as I get there,
I'll let you know more... okay?

Hijole mija Mexico.
Okay, please.

Please just be
careful and call me

when you get there.

I will. I promise.
Okay, mama.. I have to go.

But, I love you.

Bye, mi amor. I love you too.
Please be careful, don't forget

to call... I love you.

Te amo, mama.
(good bye)

Te amo.

Almost there. Another fifty
miles and we're home free.

Hmm, I'm happy for us.
My mom is a nervous wreck.

I have to call her as soon as we
get there. I hate putting her

through this. I love you.

I love you too, sexy.

So we know that if it's a boy
it'll be Johnny the third.

But, what are we going to
name it if it's a girl?

I don't know.
I'm not good with names.

Just pick something from the
Bible. It's always a safe bet.

Okay.
How about Abigail?

Oh God, anything but that,
Becca. Jesus! Abigail?

Sounds like an old lady.

How about Ana?
I have a tia named Ana.

Ana, alright. I
can live with that.

Ana it shall be. I'm
still hopin' for Trey though.

Trey? What is Trey? I thought it
was gonna be Johnny the third?

Yea... John... Trey means three.
It's a white thing I guess.

Well, whatever. It's gonna
be a boy. I can feel it.

US Citizen? Habla English?

No habla engles.
(I don't speak english)

Salir de coche, por favor.
(open the door please)

He's gotta a gun!

Ahhh shit. What's this?
That doesn't look good.

Is that the border?

Naaa, it's one of them
check points.

What the fuck was that?
No! No, no, no, no, no.

No! What the fuck?
Jesus Christ. Becca. No, no, no.

You're gonna be okay.
You'll be fine. Oh shit.

HELP!

You're gonna be okay.
Oh God. Oh God.

REBEC... Oh sweet... No, no, no,
no, no, no, no... God, no, no.

HELP!

Oh Father, what do I do? No, no,
no, no, no. Oh Becca, Ohhh shit,

Lord. Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I
need you more now than I've ever

have. Please Heavenly Father.
Save this woman that I love and

my unborn child. Please God,
please. Take me instead of them.

Please God, please
take me. Please.

Oh babe, babe. Babe,
you're bleeding.

You're safe. You're safe.

No! Baby?
Thank God, you're safe.

You and the baby are all that
matter... take care of the baby.

What happened? No!

God's calling me home.

Johnny? Hey baby. No, no! No!

Well folks, that's how I went
out. I made some mistakes.

Some big ones. God gave me the
power to help, to heal.

Sometimes I used it for the good
of the people and several times

I let my selfishness and
lack of faith get in the way.

The good father
had bigger plans for me.

So he's decided to
take me home.

Rebecca and the baby,
they'll be fine.

God granted me
one last miracle.

Life for my love and a
future for my unborn baby.

If you were wondering, an angel
