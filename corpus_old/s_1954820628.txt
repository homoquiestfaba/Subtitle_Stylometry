THEME SONG: Toxic Crusaders.

Toxic Crusaders.

I had no friends,
no girls that hugged

me til I got radioactive ugly.

Toxic Crusaders.

Toxic Crusaders.

I live in a dump,
becausethe rent's real low.

Got a little pet
Blobbie who loves me so.

Toxic Crusaders.

Toxic Crusaders.

Now me and the boys fight
against wrong, though we're

hideously deformed.

Hey, I'm sitting on
top of the world.

With my mop, tutu, and girl.

Whoa!

Toxic Crusaders.

Toxic Crusaders.

Toxic!

[music playing]

DJ (ON RADIO): Good
morning, Island City!

This is radio station
WOPU, reminding

everyone we've gota stage 87 smog

alert, so wear your gas mask.

And remember-- don't get caught
outside during an acid rain

storm.

It's a horrible way to go.

I love this town!

Do you know why
I love this town?

Because you own it?

Because it's the most
polluted city in the world.

And I, Dr. Killemoff,
made it that way.

Look.

I know you're an
evil genius, doc.

What I don't know
is where you want

me to dump this grossoleum 90.

Ah, yes, grossoleum,
the deadliest

toxic waste known to man.

Dump it in the last
unpolluted city

in New Jersey-- Tromaville.

I don't know if that's
such a good idea, doc.

What if some complete
and hopeless nerd

falls into the
grossoleum and transforms

into a hideously deformed
creature of superhuman size

and strength?

Don't be ridiculous!

A complete and hopeless nerd.

Oh, I wish I wasn't a
complete and hopeless nerd.

Maybe then I'd have a girlfriend
who loves me for who I am.

Or at least confuses
me with someone else.

Hey, Bimbette.

Look at Melvin Junko.

What a complete
and hopeless nerd.

Yeah.

Gag with me a rake.

Melvin's a real nuclear puker.


How about if we have
some fun with old Melvin

and show everybody what
a bogus geek he is?


That's a def idea, Bonehead.

What's the plan?

[music playing]

Whoa!

You think he's stupid
enough to fall for it?

Oh!

Never mind.

Hey, I'll catch
you later, babe.

Hi, Melvin.

You look really,
really cute today.

I do?

Oh, yeah.

In fact, I think it's time
I dumped scuzzy old Bonehead

and started dating a
really cute guy like you.

You do?

Would I lie?

So what are you doing night?

How about if you meet me
at the pool after the club

closes, and we get to
know each other better?

Know what I mean?

No.

But I'll be there.

Great.

Oh, would you also
do me one big favor?

You want to hear me burp?

No.

I want you to wear a special
outfit on our date tonight.

A tutu?

Oh, gee.

I don't now.

Please, Melvie?

It would mean so much
to little Bimbette

if big handsome Melvie-welvie
wore the cute little tutu.

Aw, OK.

If it means so much to you.

You sure you don't
want to hear me burp?

What a moron.

Oh, boy!

This is my lucky day!

I got a girlfriend!

Yippee!


Sorry.

Gee.

I hope Bimbette thinks
I look OK for our date.

Pink isn't really my color.

I hope my mop doesn't clash.

Yoo-hoo!

Bimbette!

I'm ready!

Bimbette?


Get a load of Melvin.

He fell for it.

Nice tutu, Melvin.

You look real good in pink.



Whoa!



I just had the
strangest feeling

I made a mistake sending that
grossoleum to Tromaville.

A complete and hopeless nerd?

Nah.



Please, help me!

I'm changing into
something horrible.

I'm changing into [inaudible].

A hideously deformed
creature of superhuman size

and strength!


A what?

Oh.

I got a big problem.

Mom, it's me, Melvin.

Melvin, my son.

Oy.

Oh!

Oh, what am I going to do?

Now that I'm a
hideously deformed

creature of superhuman
size and strength,

where will I even live?

Try the toxic waste dump.

Thanks, Mom.

I knew I could count on you.

My new home.

Oh, well.

I guess it isn't so bad.

Look at the bright side--
how many people have

a home that glows in the dark?

[monster noise]

Well, hi, little fella.

Why, you're a cute little blob.

Let's see.

What'll I call you?

I know.

How about Blobbie?


Well, Blobbie.

Here's where I
will live my life.

All alone.

With no one to love
or care for me.

But you.

[girl singing]

Hey!

What's that beautiful sound?


[music playing]

La, la, la, la.

The world is beautiful.

The world is love.

Hey, sweet thing.

You got something we want.

Your-- your accordion, dumbo.

Give it.

Now.

Hey, this-- this is weird.

Something bad is
happening nearby.

I can feel it in my body.

YVONNE: Somebody
help me, please!

Let go of my accordion!

Now I'm sure.

Somebody's hurting an accordion.

Help!

Help!

Hey, you punks.

Leave that girl alone.

Whoa.

Look, fellas.

It's Melvin the mop boy.

Your days of picking on
nerds and accordion players

are over, Bonehead.

Let's get him.


This'll teach you to mess with
a hideously deformed creature

of superhuman size and strength.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!


Hey, man!

What's happening to me?

I better get out of here!

Feel lucky, punk?

Not really, no.

Whoa!

Are you OK?

Fine, thanks to you.

I did lose my contact lenses
so I can't see too good.

Gosh.

You're very handsome.

Boy, this really
is my lucky day.

Yvonne.

Gee.

That's a pretty name.

Thanks.

It means pretty girl
who walks in sunlight.

Or big, rusty pooper scooper.

I forget which.

So what should I call you?

Well, I used tobe called Melvin,

but now that I've had a small
accident with toxic chemicals,

I think I need a new name.


How about if I
call you Chemicals?

Or [inaudible]?

Or how about---Toxie.

That's it.

You can call me Toxie.

Uh oh.

I'm getting that
weird feeling again.

Something evil is happening.

And it's happening real close.

BOY: Help!

Bad guys are going to destroy
our orphanage so they can build

a poisonous chemical plant!

Hm.

Where could that evil be?

Huh?

Hey, bad guys are trying
to destroy that orphanage.

That's not right.


And my mop is alive.

I bet that happened when it
fell into the toxic chemicals

with me.

OK, Mop.

Let's you and me
clean up this mess.

Have no fear.

Toxie's here.

Let go of her, you creep!

Oh, thank you, Toxie.

You're welcome, sweetheart.

Now please step aside.

A battle against evil is
no place for a little girl.

Whoa!

Are you all right?

I'm having a ball!


Ha!

Ha ha!

Hey.

You shot my tutu.

Now I'm really mad
Excuse me, but I need

this vehicle to fight evil.


Whee!


Toxie!

Toxie!

Toxie!

Toxie!

Can you tell our home viewers
what just happened here?

I'm not sure, but I think my
new boyfriend talks to his mop.

Oh, yeah.

I'll tell you what happened.

My son, Melvin Junko, who is now
a hideously deformed creature

with superhuman
size and strength,

saved those poor orphans from
being thrown out of their home.

We understand your
name is Melvin Junko.

Not anymore.

From now on, my name is Toxie.

And I'm a crusader
against pollution,

crime, and other stuff.

So I guess we could call
you the Toxie Crusader.

Hey, yeah.

I like that.

The Toxic Crusader.

Neat.

No!

How could this be happening?

I told you so.

What did you say?

Nothing.

He must be stopped.

This-- this Toxic
Crusader must be

eradicated or all my
plans to pollute the world

will be destroyed.

Let me take care of
this Toxic Crusader.

Why should I give you the
pleasure of killing him?

Because he did this to me!

All right then.

Do away with him, and you
will be well rewarded.

No sweat.

You can say goodbye
to the Toxic Crusader.

Goodbye.

[music playing]


I'm feeling warm and snuggly.

Got a girlfriend,
although I'm awful ugly.

I'm a hero.

I'm feeling warm and snuggly.

I'm feel--

Hey, what happened
to the happy music?

Oh, well.

OK, Toxic Crusader, get ready
to become the crushed crusader.

Uh oh.

I got that old feeling.

Oh, no.

Look out, little girl.

Look out!

Are you OK, Toxie?

Actually, I'm feeling
a little rundown.

He's moving in for the kill.

This is the end of
the Toxic Crusader.

I don't know, Dr. Killemoff.

What if old Toxie
jumps out of the way

and defeats Bonehead with
his super powered mop?

Don't be ridiculous!

Are you ready, Mop?

Whoa!


Oh, no!

Bonehead has been
defeated by the Toxic

Crusader's cursed mop.

I told you so.

What did you say?

Nothing.

I will have to put an end to
this Toxic Crusader myself.

Psycho, prepare my
Radiation Rangers for battle

while I prepare a special
weapon just in case.

He still might beat
us if he's helped

by other hideously
deformed creatures

with superhuman
size and strength.

Psycho!

I grow weary of your
ridiculous ideas.

Sorry.

Bad guys are so stupid.

Yvonne, it's me, Toxie.

Oh, Toxie, I missed you so!

Whoa!

Honey, where are you?

I'm right here, Yvonne.

Oh, goody.

I have a surprise for you.

I got new glasses so I can
finally see your gorgeous face.


Yvonne, no!


Aw, I should have
known this would happen.

How could a beautiful,
intelligent girl like Yvonne

ever fall for a
hideously deformed

creature such as myself?

But I did fall for you, Toxie.

Huh?

But the minute you saw how
ugly I am, you screamed.

You're not ugly.

You're very handsome.

It's your tie that
made me scream.

Now that's ugly.

I mean, more than ugly.

It's gross.

OK.

So she's just beautiful.

[helicopter approaching]

Uh, Toxie, honey, I don't
think I can go out tonight.

I really have to wash my hair.

Can I help you?

Say your prayers,
Toxic Crusader.

Why?

Am I going to bed now?

No.

You are going to die for
standing in the way of my plans

to pollute Tromaville.

But why do you want
to pollute Tromaville?

What good does it do anybody
to poison the environment?

I've always
wondered that myself.

It may be poison to humans
but not to the people

of my planet-- Smogula.

Oh, man.

I'm working for a cockroach?

For the Smogulans to
take over this planet,

the air and water must be
first poisoned to our liking.

But if you poison our
planet-- as if we can't do it

ourselves-- then all human
and animal life will die.

What's your point?

Whoa.

I am definitely in the
presence of some big time evil.

My point is this, bughead!

This is my planet.

Even though I don't
look like I'm from it.

And this is my town,
which means it's

my job to keep it
safe, beautiful,

and free from pollution.

Then prepare todie, Toxic Crusader.

Apocalypse now!

I sure could use some help.

Excuse me, but me and my friend
are looking for a hideously

deformed creature named Toxie.

Have you seen him?

He's up there.

Oh, yeah.

That's him.

Achoo!

Gesundheit.

Thank you.



You fools, get him!

I hate this part.

It's cleanup time!

Oh, sorry.


Excuse me.

My name's No-Zone.

This is my friend,
Major Disaster.

We're both hideously deformed
creatures with superhuman size

and strength.

Really?

Me, too.

Yeah, we know.

We saw you on TV and
wanted to come join you.

Well, I have to warn you.

It's a tough job.

There's no dental plan.

And we don't get any piece
of the merchandising.

Ah, that's OK.

We just want to fight bad guys.

Great.

You're hired.

What's Major Disaster doing?

Oh, he has a power
to control plants.

It takes him a few seconds
to get going, though.

Hey!
What's going on?

-Let go.
-Psycho!

Let go!

Hey!

Hey, that's a cool superpower.

Release Polluto.

Destroy the Toxic
Crusader and his friends.

Uh, look.

It's some kind of
living oil slick.

Mop, come back!

Mop hates a mess.

Oh, no!

That thing ate my mop.

Well, what do we do now?

I've got an idea.

Follow me.

Kitty litter?

What are we doing
with kitty litter?

Toxie, we're not
fighting Heathcliff.

Trust me.

Just empty the kitty
litter onto the ground.

Now No-Zone, aim your
schnozzle at that thing

and use your sneeze power.

You got it, buddy.

Ah-- ah-- ah-- ahchoo!

The kitty litter is
drying up the oil slick.

Oh, Mop!

Are you OK?


DR. KILLEMOFF: This
can't be happening!

If it weren't for
those other two

hideously deformed creatures
helping the Toxic Crusader,

I would have defeated him!

I told you so.



Oh, Toxie!

I'm so proud of you!

You saved Tromaville.

Of course he saved Tromaville.

He's my son.

He's a hero.

I'm no hero, Mom.

I'm just doing my part to
keep Tromaville beautiful,

safe, and free from pollution.

Gee, what an
amazing coincidence.

All three of us were
turned into hideously

deformed creatures with
superhuman size and strength

by accident.

That's right.

I was a soldierin the Army when I

fell into a radioactive swamp.

NO-ZONE: And I was a pilot
when I flew through a hole

in the ozone and crashed
my plane into a silo

of radioactive pepper.


TOXIE: Gesundheit.

NO-ZONE: Thank you.

I've got it.

The answer to our problems.

I found jobs for all of us.

Jobs?

Why do we need jobs, anyway?

We're the Toxic Crusaders!

Yes, but superheroing isn't
a very high paying profession.

And the landlord wants his rent.

And the medical benefits stink.

Uh, anything for a hideously
deformed creature with

superhuman size and strength?

Sort of.

This ad calls for someone
who loves children

and doesn't mind getting messy.

Close enough.

Yvonne, this job calls for
a person with a warm heart

and superior musical skills.


Perfect.

"Looking for someone who
really wants to clean up."

Forget it, Mop.

This one is mine.

Oh, here's one for me.

"Earn big pay.

No heavy lifting."

What about me?

Well, how about this?
"Looking for someone who is

outgoing and has a large nose."

It's a stretch,
but I'll try it.


I don't like this, Killemoff.

That's Dr. Killemoff to you.

Uh, yeah, sure.

I'm sorry, uh, Dr. Killemoff.

It won't happen again.

Anyway, like I was saying,
I don't like it, Killem--

I-- I mean, Dr. Killemoff.

You're talking about
messing with the food

that little kids love to eat.

I'll give you half
of the profits.

Deal.

I hate kids, anyway.

This is perfect!

Everyone in Tromaville
eats at Burpo Burger.

Yeah, they got great fries.

Exactly.

And once I adjust those
fries to my evil purpose,

I'll control the
people of Tromaville.

Then no one can stop me from
polluting this disgustingly

clean little town.

And once I pollute Tromaville,
the rest of the world is mine!

What happens if one
of the Toxic Crusaders

gets a job at Burpo Burger
and foils your plan?

Impossible!

Imagine a Toxic Crusader
working at Burpo Burger.

Ridiculous.

My plan is flawless!


Yeah.

Even now, evil Dr. Bender
is working on the most

dastardly part of my plan.


Here, my friend.

One taste of this,
and you'll turn

into a forgetful,
nearsighted old rat.


Oh, yeah.

No!

No!

This is the 81st batch,
and it still isn't right.

I need to test this right away.

I need a human guinea pig.

I need--


Aha.

Hey, Stretch.

This where the evil
genius Dr. Bender hangs?

Yes.

Yes.

I'm the evil genius Dr. Bender.

Cool.

I got a telegram
from a Dr. Killemoff.

How touching.

He remembered my birthday.

And that's more than I can
say for my evil genius mother.

Here's a little
message just for you.

Don't dilly-dally.

I need the goo.

If you fail, you'll die today.

Sincerely yours, Dr. K.

What kind of a birthday
greeting is that?

Hey, I don't write em.

I just sing em.

Ah, no matter.

Have some soup.

No, thanks, Doc.

I'm a vegetarian.

Why don't you just give me a
tip, and we'll call it even?


Look out!

Oh, I hate this job, man.

DR. BENDER: Look out!

The atom smasher.


Ooh, [inaudible].

And turn off that
infernal radio!

FENDER: Hey, it's your telegram.



Where are we going, Doc?

Egads.

The atom smasher made
us into one person.

So unsmash, man.

I don't know how.

Bummer.

It's going to be a little
tough picking up chicks.

Say, do you like sushi, Doc?

I can't wait.

I'm really going to
clean up in this job.

You sure are.

And you can start by
dusting the window display.

So, lady, should I start here?

Oh, man.

Oh, man.

Oh, yeah.

It worked.

It's become a forgetful,
nearsighted old rat.

Like I always say, the
82nd time's the charm.

Oh, what is that goo?

This isn't just any goo.

This is-- ahh!

My arm!

What's wrong with my arm?

It doesn't work.

Sure, it does.

Hi, Doc.

Hi!

Now as I was saying,
this isn't just any goo.

Anyone who eats it will
turn into a forgetful,

nearsighted old person.

Pull off that paper.

I call it Magoop 82.

Gross.

Why'd you make it?

Because it's exactly what
Dr. Killemoff ordered.


YVONNE: (SINGING)
Oh, give to the poor.

Give cause it's right.

Oh.

Come on, guys.

Pick it up.

Tempo, tempo, tempo.

-All right.

All right.

Jeez.

Thank you, kind sir.

Thanks, Toxie.

I always hated this shirt.

Now I won't have
to wear it anymore.

Glad I could help.

Toxie, your tromatons
are acting up.

Oh, they sure are.

I better find out why fast.

Whoa!

DR. KILLEMOFF: It's
working perfectly.

In just a few moments,
my Radiation Rangers

will have spread the Magoop 82
over the whole potato patch,

setting my plan into full swing.

I don't know.

What if the Toxic Crusader's
tromatons start acting up

and he shows up and beats
all our guys to a pulp?

Don't be a fool!

Bonehead is in charge.

And I know I'm going
to be proud of him.

Dr. Killemoff's going
to be proud of me.

And maybe I'll get a promotion.

Maybe I'll get a raise.

Maybe he'll stop
slapping me around.

TOXIE: It's Killemoff's
Radiation Rangers.

They're polluting the potato
patch with toxic chemicals.

That's un-American.

YVONNE: You've got
to stop him, Toxie.

Right.

You know what you need?

A good luck kiss.

Uh-uh.

A battle cry.

I do?

Uh-huh.

Something to yell before
you do battle that'll strike

fear in the hearts
of your enemies.

Something like it's clobbering
time or hi-ho silver!

Hm.

Wait.

I got it.

I don't get hurt!

We'll work on it.

Look out!

It's the Toxic Crusader!

Stop him!


Yeah!

Now finish off the
toxic troublemaker.

Oh, man.

Now what?


Mashed potatoes.

You gotta do better
than that to beat me.

What the?

Hey!

What happened?

Yeah, what happened?

The mashed potatoes-- they
must have clogged up the intake

vent on his life support system.

He's overheating.

Oh, yeah!

Shoot, you cowards!


Back in the truck.

Quick!

Hey!

You think you won, don't you?

Well, go have some
Burpo fries on me!


Toxie, you beat em!

No, I mashed em.

Whatever.

I wonder what they were up to.

Why do they call them
Burpo Burgers, Dad?

Eh, don't ask.

Hi, kids.

It's me, Burpo Magician.

And we're going to have fun.


And [inaudible] are my game.

And if you think I really stink,
I'll say you stink the same.

Ta-da!

Oh, boy.

Tough crowd.

Hi, kids!

How about some balloon animals?

Ta-da!

It looks like a foot.

Well, uh, it is a foot.

You know how hard it is
to sculpt body parts?

I wonder when I
get a coffee break.

OK.

This is the first batch of
Burpo fries made from potatoes

treated with Magoop 82.

Cool.

Burpo fries are the best.

No.

Don't eat those, fool.

Or we'll turn into forgetful,
nearsighted old men.

Yuck!

I thought they
just made you fat.

Enough talk!

I want results.

Show me that it works.

Chill, Chief.

We told the staff here not to
eat any of the new Burpo fries

because they're extra special.

So what?

So of course they
ate them right away.

Say, watch where you're going.

Hey, what's going on here?


Excellent.

Uh, excuse me, chubby.

You know where the restroom is?


Find it yourself, old man.

Uh, find what?

Uh, the rest of the Burpo frie
swill be ready this afternoon.

Perfect.

Soon all of Tromaville
will be full of forgetful,

nearsighted old people.

And nothing will stop me from
making this town my pollution

headquarters-- suburban branch.

Like I said before, what if
one of the Toxic Crusaders

gets a job here and
discovers your plan?

Ridiculous!

What are the odds
of that happening?

NO-ZONE: They love me.

I'm a hit!

Uh oh.

It looks like the
odds are pretty good.

I don't suppose you guys would
like some balloon animals.


TOXIE: Ice cream.

Ice cream.

Get it before it gets away.

How's business, Toxie?

Oh, terrible.

No one likes warm ice cream.

How is your job, Major Disaster?

I got fired just because
I broke a couple of bowls.

I lost my job, too.

They didn't
appreciate good music.

MRS. JUNKO: Yah!

This is great!

I've been going door to door,
and I sold five of these babies

already.

You might say I'm
sweeping the town.

That's great, Mom.

What's your secret?

I just get in the
house, and I tell them

it's so heavy that I might
have a heart attack if they

make me take it out again.

It's the old sympathy game.

I thought the job
said no heavy lifting.

This is nothing.

You should see the deluxe model.

Gotta run.

Lots more to sell.

Let's go see how No-Zone
is doing at Burpo Burger.


What happened?

I don't know where I am.


I always wondered why this
place had such bad service.

Excuse me.

Have you seen our
friend, No-Zone?

Uh, you mean the funny
looking guy with the big nose

who sneezes all the time?

Yeah.

Uh, never saw him.

So where is he?

I could be wrong, but I think
he was taken to the laboratory

of an evil genius scientist.

How do you know that?

Because it says so right here.

"We took your friend
to the laboratory

of the evil genius Dr. Bender.

Come and get him."

It's signed, "Your
Pal, Dr. Killemoff."

Eat it, magician.

It's good for you.

Hey!

If it's that good,
I'll eat it myself.

Are you always this stupid?

I don't know.

Let me think.

Never mind.

Come on.

What are you doing?

Don't worry.

We're just getting
ready for your friends.

They should be here any minute.

Cool.

A party.

I'll make the dip.

You are the dip.

Yay!

The good guys.

Whoa!

Do something!

I'm trying!

I'm trying!

Wow!

What a ride.

You're not a very nice
guy-- or couple of guys--

or whatever you are.

Say, how about some wrinkle
cream, Toxic Crusader?

Throw it!

No!

He's a cool superhero.

Throw it!

Ow!

All right already.

I wish you'd stop doing that.

Holy cow!

Stop, you idiot!


I give up.


You did it!

I did?

I'm saved!


I'm dead.

Yoo-hoo, Toxic Crusader!

I'm in here!

I hope I don't get hurt!

Yvonne's right.

It needs work.

Sneaky, Doc.

Very sneaky.


I'm too young to be old.

Hang on, buddy!

Hurry!

It doesn't look good, Doc.

It's good to be Toxie.

Hey, now that's catchy.

Let's get out of here!

NO-ZONE: Help!

Hold on, No-Zone.

We're coming.

Thanks, Toxie.

It was getting
awful hot in there.

My hero.

What in blazes is
going on here, No-Zone?

It's this goo.

It turns people into forgetful,
nearsighted old folks.

BONEHEAD: Special
on Burpo fries!

Two for one!

Get your Burpo fries!

Good.

It's not too late.

NO-ZONE: Yeah, no one's
eating any bad fries yet.

The Toxic Crusaders!

You guys, mind the store.

I've got an evil
plan to carry out.

Attention, everyone.

The evil genius
Dr. Bender has put

a chemical on the Burpo fries.

If you eat them, you'll
turn into forgetful,

nearsighted old folks.

Baloney!


It works.

I'm amazing.

I'm an evil genius.

Evil genius, huh?

Hey.

Hi-ya, Toxie.

Say, what's going
on here, anyway?

Is it senior citizens'
day or something?

Not now, Yvonne.

I'm trying to beatup on a bad guy.

OK, Mr. Evil Genius--
and the other guy.

Prepare to be seriously hurt.

Uh, yeah, yeah.

In a minute.

Who's the rad babe?

Who?

Yvonne?

She's my beautiful, thoughsome
what light girlfriend.

You've got a girlfriend?

I may be a hideously
deformed creature

of superhuman size and
strength, but I am a good guy.

I knew we should
have been a good guy.

The bad guys never
get the chicks.

Say.

Ready for that beating now?

Eh.

Forget that.

We want to be good guys now.

Yeah.

We want to be toxic
crustaceans like you guys.

As long as we get to hang out
with cool babes like Yvonne.

Well, I can't promise anything,
but she does have a sister.

Good enough.

We're good guys now.

Not so fast.

I mean, you're certainly
hideously deformed enough,

but I think you should at
least come up with an antidote

to help all these
poor people before we

let you be a toxic crustacean.

Crusader.

Whatever.

But there is no antidote.

I just love Burpo fries.

Anybody want some?

Yvonne, no!

Hey, there's something
wrong with these fries.

Whoa.

They taste like-- like--

Bubblegum?

I don't get it.

She ate the same fries
as everyone else.

Yeah.

How come she's not old?

I'll tell you a secret.

I don't eat em plain.

I like to put pepper on em.

That's it.

Pepper.

Pepper is the antidote.

It turns the Magoop
82 into bubblegum.

And pretty tasty, at that.

OK.

I found the antidote.

So are we Toxic
Crusaders or what?

Well, actually, Yvonne
found the antidote.

But what the hey?

Rad.

Attention, everyone.

Put pepper on your fries, and
you'll turn back to normal.


We'll help them later.

We've gotta stop Dr.
Killemoff from spraying all

the vegetables with Magoop 82.

Even the broccoli?

Yep.

Even the broccoli.

Ooh, now I am mad.

In a few minutes,
every vegetable

will be covered with Magoop 82.

And Tromaville will be mine.

Unless the Toxic Crusaders
come up with an antidote.

You know, I'm
really sick of you.


We're too late.

We'll never stop em.

We're not done yet.

What's that?

Pepper.

Oh, no.

I hate pep-- pep-- pepper.

Ready?

Drop!

Tromaville is mine!

Next stop-- the world!


TOXIE: Give it all
you've got, buddy.

Ah-- ah--


Gesundheit.

What's that?

What's that?

It looks like bees.

PSYCHO: Looks like
antidote to me.

DR. KILLEMOFF: No!

No!

PSYCHO: Yes!

Yes!

Phew.

You did it, No-Zone!

You saved the vegetables.

Even the broccoli.

We did it!


I hope everyone likes
their vegetables well done.

I hate those Toxic Crusaders.

MAJOR DISASTER: Now that
you're a, uh, Toxic Crusader,

what do we call you?

Well, I'm Fender.

I'm Bender.

Gee, that's kind of confusing.

We need just one
name for both of you.

-Ow.
-Huh.

That's it.

We'll call you Headbanger.

Why?

At last, the moment is at hand.

Soon hordes of
pollution-breathing aliens

from the planet Smogula
will be arriving

to take over Tromaville.

I must arrange a
suitable landing

site for my fellow Smogulans.

Any suggestions, Mayor Grody?

Uh, what about the
Tromaville old folks' home.

It's spacious,
convenient, and you

can walk to the supermarket.

Smogulans don't have feet!

They have little wheels.

That's even better.

All the curbs at the home
have wheelchair ramps.

Yeah, boss.

And the old geezers will
be a cinch to throw out.

Uh, Bonehead is right.

I remember how easy it was to
throw my own dear mother out

of the house.

She weighed practically nothing.

I like it!

Psycho, fill the spray tanks
with pollution solution.

Bonehead!

Take a platoon of
Radiation Rangers

and toss those old
duffers off the property.


And you said there was no
fringe benefits to this job.

I'm worried, boss.

Like, what if the
Toxic Crusader's mom

happens to be friends with
one of those old biddies?

And she calls on the
Toxic Crusaders to help?

And he and his fellow
mutant creatures

kick butt on our
Radiation Rangers?

What a preposterous idea!

No wonder they call you Psycho.

MAYOR GRODY: That's it!

Keep the line moving.

We got a dozen more
vans to fill before--


Lunch break.

Oh, Mayor Grody!

You can't do this!

I can do anything I want.

I'm His Honor, the mayor.

But some of my best
friends are moldy oldies!

Look, lady.

This is official city business.

So butt out.

Oh, unless, of course, you
are a registered party voter.


In which case, have a
little leftover jelly donut?

I'll never be that hungry!

You'll pay for this.

Even if I didn't.

I'm telling my son,
the superhero, on you.

Radiation Rangers?
Here?

In Tromaville?

Carting away all the
old folks in moving vans?

Yeah.

And they're not even using the
kind with those heavy pads.

Fellas, it's time for us to
dish out a little justice.

Toxic Crusader style.

All right.

Excellent notion, Tox-man.

the Toxic Crusaders.

We're the Toxic Crusaders.

We're the Toxic Crusaders.


We're the Toxic Crusaders.

We're the Toxic Crusaders.

Boys.

They're always fighting
and kicking and punching.

Why couldn't I have
had a little girl?

PSYCHO: Come on.

Move it, people.

Move it.

BONEHEAD: Yeah.

Pretend like you're going
to visit your grandchildren.

TOXIE: That'll be just
about enough of that.

Huh?

Who said that?

We did!

The Toxic Crusaders?

In the hideously deformed
and mutilated flesh.

Come on, bozos.

Let's rumble!

That means fight!

I know that.

I may be Psycho,
but I'm not stupid.

Radiation Rangers,
front and center.



It's OK, guys.

This is all me.

Hey.

Let's see you mutilated
morons try that on me!

I'll handle this.

Whoa!


What-- what are you guys doing?

You're going on a
little space ride, man.

Ready to peel?

Three, two-- blastoff!

Whoa!

TOXIE: Don't worry.

Those awful people won't
be bothering you anymore.

Is that a promise?

Cross my hideous
lydeformed heart.

Whoops!

Toxic Crusaders, to thank you
for rescuing us and protecting

the environment,
we have prepared

a special celebration dinner.

Cool, daddio.

Uh, I mean, mammio.

We're serving powdered
eggs with mashed potatoes.

And for dessert, some graham
crackers dunked in hot cocoa.

If you need em, I'll even
donate my extra set of teeth

to chew it with.

Whoa!

My stomach just
did a full gator.

Sometimes you
really embarrass me.

It sounds mighty
tempting, but we hideously

deformed creatures of
superhuman size and strength

have to avoid richfoods in order

to maintain our fighting edge.

I would like the teeth, though.

They come in handy for pulling
pins out of hand grenades.

Once again, those
Toxic Crusaders have

destroyed my best laid plans!

I told you so.

You did what?

Uh, I mean, wow.

What an unexpected
turn of events!

Now how can I get rid
of those meddling mutants

while I carry out my plan?

What about an all expense paid
vacation on a tropical island?

I have it!

We'll offer the
man all expense paid

vacation on a tropical island.

What tropical island?

Why, this tropical
island, of course.

TOXIE: It's nice
of the post office

to send this stuff airmail.

They have to.

What mailman in his right
mind would enter this dump?

You're right.

Rain and snow and gloom
of night is one thing.

But toxic [inaudible] forget it.

Congratulations.

You're the lucky winner
of an all expense

paid vacation at Club Fred.

Oh, wow.

Totally triumphant, man.

A freebie vacation.

Bender, you're a scientist.

What are the odds of four
hideously deformed creatures

of superhuman size and strength
all winning the same contest?

It's got to be at
least 11 to one.

We better start packing
our meager belongings.

They've taken the bait.

The Toxic Crusaders
don't know it,

but for them, Club Fred will
soon turn out to be Club Dead.


Six miserable palm trees?

It's that all the
foliage you could find?

Hey, don't blame us, boss.

Palm trees don't grow
on trees, you know.

The Toxic Crusaders will
be arriving this afternoon.

We must disguise this island
to look like a Club Fred.

Trust me, boss.

Those bozos are so stupid, they
won't even know the difference.

I don't know, Chief.

What if every trick
we pull on them

backfires because
their sweet natured

innocence protects them?

And we end up getting
clobbered instead?

Are you starting it again?

Just a thought.

Forget I said anything.


They like us.

They really like us.

It's something we superheroes
must learn to live with.

Oh, Toxie.

I'll miss you so.

Give me a hug, you big lug.

A hug?

You bet.

Oh!

I simply melt when you hold me.

Sort of like those plastic
flowers you brought me?

YVONNE: Exactly.

Way cool.

They sent us our own
personal hovercraft.


Bye, Yvonne!

Bye, Mom!

Always wear clean underwear!

You never know when you'll
get run over by a golf cart!


Our own tropical island.

We serve breakfast in bed.

We know you'll go home smiling.

Hm.

There's something familiar
about those two guys.


I got a nose for those things.

Hold on.

This is no tropical resort.

It's Island City.

What vile scheme is Dr.
Killemoff up to this time?


Scheme?

No scheme.

Honest.

He decided to go timeshare
condo with the place.

Yeah, some kind of tax shelter.

And speaking of
shelters, wait til you

guys see your luxurious suite.

BONEHEAD: Well, what
do you think, huh?

This is a luxury suite?

A radioactive chemical
container in the middle

of an oozing swamp, bubbling
with poisonous gases?

We wanted you to feel at home.

And look at the way it glows.

You won't have to leave a
light on when you go out.

And believe me, we
intend to go out a lot.

DR. KILLEMOFF: Splendid!

With those dimwits
here on the island,

my Radiation Rangers will be
able to take over Tromaville

without interference.

Attention, attack helicopters,
activate the full scale

invasion of Tromaville!

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): While we
were off enjoying our Club Fred

vacation, a stranger appeared
in Tromaville whose arrival

would change our lives forever.

Hello there.

You must be the
Toxic Crusader's mom.

I-- I can see the resemblance.

Well, you have your nerve.

I, uh-- I only meant
it in the nicest sense.

Oh.

Well, in that case, thank you.

Yeah.

I'm looking for your son.

He's away at a
Club Fred resort,

enjoying a well
deserved vacation.

Aw.

I'll try again another time.

Uh, you-- you've been real kind.

Oh, and one more thing.

Yeah, yeah, yeah?

Stay off my lawn!

Bad dog!

Bad dog!



OK.

All set.

This is really going to blow
those Toxic Crusaders away.

You're just in time.

Here they come now.

Yo!

Honored guests!

Come on over here.

What's up?

Oh, we want to take
a picture of you guys.

Epic notion.

Maybe later we could
have it blown up.

You don't even have to wait.

You can be blown up right now.

What a strange looking camera.

Hm.

An Instablastic.

I think I've heard of them.

It's one of those
35 millimeter jobs.

Right.

A 35 millimeter cannon.

TOXIE: But first, let's take
a snapshot of you fellas.

No, don't!

Stop!

That's it.

Wave!
-No, wait!

Stop!
Stop!

-No pictures!
-Stop!

Boy, these new cameras sure
don't like it if you move.


Uh, sorry to disturb you folks,
but how do I get to Club Fred?


Don't be afraid!

I don't bite!

See?

My tail is wagging.


Maybe these people know.

Uh, hey, fellas.

I'm looking for a
club named Fred.

Is it this way?

Or is it that way?

Oh!

When can a bad guy get
a break around here?

You guys will
really enjoy this.

It's called windsurfing.

Bye bye!

Whoa!

What a joke.

Those dum dums don't
know it, but they're

headed straight for 10
tons of nuclear explosives!

Pretty neat, huh?

Hang 10, Bender!

OK.

I'll hang five,
and you hang five.

All right!

We got em this time.

[music playing]


Uh, I'm looking for
the Toxic Crusader.

Hey!

Watch it!



Whoa!

What's happening?

I don't know.

Something's pulling us away.

Uh oh.

Let's move.

W-- what d-- does it
l--look like I'm d-- doing?



It's Bonehead and Psycho.

NO-ZONE: I told you
there was something

familiar about those guys.

We'd better go tell
Killemoff about this.

No need to, you dipsticks!

Dr. Killemoff already knows.

I don't know who
you are, but thanks.

The name's Junkyard.

Us hideously deformed critter
shave to help one another

in this crazy world of ours.

So tell us.

How did you become
hideously deformed?

Do we have timefor a flashback?

Oh, sure.

It'll take Killemoff a while
to come up with a new scheme

to destroy us.

It-- it happened some time ago.

It was a dark and stormy night.

FENDER (VOICEOVER): Man,
how come all dogs start

their stories the same way?

BENDER (VOICEOVER):
Let him finish, Fender.

Speak, Junkyard.


No, no, no.

I mean, speak.

JUNKYARD (VOICEOVER): Oh.


Well, like I was saying, it
was a dark and stormy night.

I was working the night
shift at the junkyard--

uh, that's me on the right--
when this hobo crawled in

to keep dry.


The toxic ooze had
fused us together.

I was now half
bow-wow and half bum.

Now that I could
read, I discovered

newspapers were good
for more than just house

training puppies.

I read about
Tromaville-- the town

where all hideously deformed
creatures of superhuman size

and strength seemed to end up.

Whoa.

You finished that
flashback just in time.

Look what's coming.

Apocalypse attack helicopters.

And look over there.

Radiation Rangers.

As a former military man,
I'd say we're surrounded.

Toxic Crusaders, let's
fight for decency and honor.

We could really use some
heroic music about now.

[music playing]

That's more like it.

What has four wheels and flies?

An Apocalypse garbage truck.

A tree!

I need a tree!

Nah.

It's not what you're thinking.


Repeat after me.

I, Junkyard, promise
to obey all the rules

of the Toxic Crusaders.

I, Junkyard, promise
to obey all the rules

of the Toxic Crusaders.

And to stay off the furniture.

And to stay off the furn-- hey!

Just fooling.

Hooray for Junkyard!

Hooray for Junkyard!

And this will be your
own special house.

Gosh.



I got so much to
learn from you guys.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
across the bay in Island City,

our old enemy, Killemoff,
was welcoming some visitors

from his hometown
planet, Smogula.

Up left aileron.

No, no.

Lift aileron.

You're coming in too low.

Watch your altitude.

Watch your trim tab.

Watch out!

Really, Gerba.

I wish you'd pay more
attention to the signals.

Hey.

Rules are for common riffraff.

I'm a daughter of
a czar, remember?

Oh.

How could I forget?


Now someone get me out
of this stupid thing!

Allow me, Princess Gerba.



Who are you?


I'm Dr. Killemoff.

Your Heaviness.

Uh, uh, Highness.

Welcome to--


Planet Earth.

Killemoff, I expect you to
look after my little girl

during her visit here.

Understood?

Uh, you mean, you're not
staying, Your Czarship?

Believe me.

This planet isn't big
enough for both of us.

I believe you.

Well, I'll be
holographing off now.

Ta ta.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Then,
fate took a strange twist.

It all started in
the Tromaville Mall

where Princess
Gerba was fighting

the recession single-handedly.

Ain't you finished shopping
yet, Princess Gerba?

These boxes are heavy.

What a couple of wimps!

Quit complaining and join a gym.

This royal princess
is a royal pain.

Stop!

Lingerie alert.

Oh, that would
look darling on me.

I wonder if it comes in blue.

I wonder if it comes in blimp.

Let's see.

I want that one and
that one and that one.

And especially that one!

Who is that
magnificent creature?

You mean that hideously
deformed creature of superhuman

size and strength?

That's the one.

What a hunk!

Yeah, well, forget it.

That's Toxie.

And he's already
got a girlfriend.

Not anymore, he doesn't.

What Gerba wants, Gerba gets.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
This next scene

is kind of embarrassing, because
it's all about how cute I am.

So if you don't mind, I'm
not going to watch it.

Killemoff, I just met
the man of my dreams.

He's lean, he's mean,
and he's kind of green.

He sounds, uh, most attractive.

She's talking
about Toxie, Boss.

Look.

I want to marry him.

And I want you to
arrange it for me.

I'm sorry, Princess Gerba.

I'm a ruthless villain,
not a marriage broker.

You're absolutely right, boss.

Besides, what if something
happened at the last minute

to screw up the wedding
and Czar Zosta ended

up madder at you than ever?

Psycho, you babbling idiot!

Why must you always
give away the plot?

Sorry, Doc.

I guess it's like
biting my nails.

I can't stop.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, back at the dump,

our shack sweetshack was visited

by a mysterious guy in a cape.

Whoever he was, he
was a heavy smoker.


Hello?

Hello yourself.

I'd like to show you
what's in this suitcase.



What in blazes?

Sorry.

He thought you were
a Fuller Brush man

trying to sell me a new mop.

Couldn't the idiot see
that it's me, Dr. Killemoff?

Are we alone?

It's just you and me and
about seven million viewers.

Good.

Because I have some slides
I'd like to show you.

I hope they're
not baby pictures.

I get all gushy inside.

After you see these, you'll
be all gushy outside, too.

This is a Smogulan muck missle--
range 2,000 light-years.

This is Tromaville before.

This is Tromaville after.

How disgusting.

What can I do to keep
this from happening?

There's only one way.

Czar Zosta has a
daughter named Gerba.

Gerba thinks you're
a total hunk.

Gerba wants to marry you.

Gerp.

Now make your choice.

Either you marry
Gerba, or Tromaville is

completely buried in garbage.

Which will it be?

I guess I'll have to make
the supreme sacrifice.

After all, I'm an
environmental superhero.

What can I say, but oh,
I'll marry Princess Gerba.

agreed to marry Gerba,

I figured it was time I
broke the news to her.

Princess Gerba,
would you marry me?

Oh, why, this is so sudden!

I had no idea you
were going to propose.

Have we met?

I'm Toxie, a hideous
lydeformed creature

of superhuman size and strength
and all around nice guy.

Please say you'll be mine.

What girl could resist
such a romantic proposal?

The answer is-- ouch!

Watch it with those
pins, you klutz!

Or I'll peel you like a grape.

Now what were we discussing?

Oh, yeah, my marrying you.

The answer is yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes!

TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
When Mayor Grody

found out I was going
to marry Princess Gerba,

he got real upset.

Why should I be the only one?


Imagine Toxie and
some overweight

cockroach getting married.

Ew!

How totally gross!

It just gives me the shivers.

Yeah.

You'd think a cockroach
would have better taste.

She should have
picked you instead.

Then you could become
the ruler of Smogula

once her father, the Czar,
kicked the bucket, which would

probably be the same day he
found out his daughter was

marrying a crooked mayor.


What a great idea!

I'm surprised you thought of it.

Yeah, me, too.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
on the planet Smogula,

Czar Zosta decided to reach
out and touch Dr. Killemoff.

He waited till six o'clock
when the rates were lower,

then he called him
up holographically.

Hologram for Dr. Killemoff.

Hologram for Dr. Killemoff.

You wished to see me, Your
Royal High and Mightiness?

Yes.

How is Gerba's
visit progressing?

Splendidly, Czar Zosta.

I was just about to call you.

But I was waiting until after
six when the rates are lower.

The Toxic Crusader has asked
for your daughter's hands

in marriage-- all four of them.

And she's accepted.

What?

My little Gerba?

Married to the Toxic Crusader?

Now, now, Your Czarship.

You're not losing a daughter.

You're gaining a mop-wielding,
toxically disfigured,

tutu-wearing mutant.

Hm.

I never thought of it that way.

Besides, with
Toxie on our side,

we'll be able to
invade Tromaville

without any resistance.

Excellent.

I'll make the wedding
arrangements immediately.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): The
next part was really tough.

I had to break off my hot and
heavy romance with Yvonne.

[music playing]


Why, hello, Toxie.

My woman's intuition tells me
that our hot and heavy romance

is-- over.

Boy.

I could never fool
you about anything.

Oh, Toxie!

And I thought we had
something special!

We did.

But something bigger
came between us.

Gerba.

It's either marry her or
see our beloved Tromaville

completely buried in garbage.

You great, big,
unselfish lug, you!

I could kiss you for that!

Please, Yvonne.

You're not making
this any easier.

Hey!

Forget that bleached
blond bimbo.

You belong to me now!



Like the song says, when
a lovely flame succumbs,

smoke gets in your lungs.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, Dr. Killemoff

was cooking up another of
his evil double crosses.

This wedding ceremony
will be the perfect chance

for a political coup.

Uh, what's a coup?

A coo is half a
coo-coo, you coo-coo.

A coup means an overthrow!

Once Czar Zosta is here on
Earth, you two will grab him.

And throw him over?


Oh, I like doing
stuff like that.

And then I will become
the new ruler of Smogula.

But what if Czar Zosta's
brand new son-in-law,

Toxie, defends his brand new
family and cleans our clock?

I haven't got time
for your psychobabble.

I have a coup to pursue.

stolen by Gerba, my heart

made a sound like a burp-a.

A gut-wrenching blow!

Oh, poor Yvonne.

Her heart is breaking.

[yvonne singing]

YVONNE (SINGING): Oh, I miss
him-- (HIGH-PITCHED) so!

Not to mention our mirrors.

That brings us to-- [inaudible]
56 years of bad luck.

Troops, we've got
to do something

to cheer up the little lady.

It's as plain as the
nose on No-Zone's face.

What Yvonne needs is
a new main squeeze.

Great.

Who are we going
to get to date her?

How about me?
Me!

Uh-uh.

Not you, Blobbie.

Someone of her own species.

Aw.

I know.

We'll all take her out.

Won't that get kind of crowded?

I didn't mean
all of us at once.

We'll take her
out one at a time.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): It
wasn't easy watching my best

buddies romancing my best girl.

The first luckystiff was Junkyard.

Junkyard, this picnic was
a simply marvelous idea.

And all this time, I thought you
were nothing but a hound dog.

I'm a mutt of
many moods, Yvonne.

Permit me to dispose
of your chicken bones.

Can I get you anything else?

Maybe a shovel.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Yvonne
had just enough time

to wash her hair and take a
flea bath before her movie

matinee date with Headbanger.

"Attack of the Zombie Surfers."

Nonsense.

Yvonne is much too intellectual
for garbage like that.

We'll see paramecium on parade."

Zombie Surfers.

No. paramecium on Parade.

Zombie Surfers.




No, take this, too.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): While all
this dating was going on,

Dr. Killemoff was going
over his latest dirty scheme

to Bonehead and Psycho.

Now here's the plan.

Bonehead, Psycho, grab the
end of this scroll and run.

What's this thing, boss?

A giant roll of super
sticky fly paper.

I plan to trap Czar Zosta in it
and make him bend to my will.

Yeah!

That should really bug him!




No!

No!

Look out!



TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Major
Disaster-- nature lover

that he is-- took Yvonne
for a romantic stroll

under the trees.

[clearing throat]

Yvonne, your eyes are the
color of, uh, Kentucky bluegrass

just after it's been fertilized.

Why, Mayor Disaster,
you sweet talker, you.

Oh, look at those
gorgeous bananas.

Would you like one?

That's easy.

Yo, banana tree, we'll
have a ripe one to go.

This looks like a good one.




One good thing about
this date-- at least

I won't have totake another bath.

Killemoff, how many time
shave I told you never

to hologram when I'm eating?

Forgive me, Your Beedleness.

It's about the wedding.

Sorry, Killemoff.

Only family and close
friends are invited.

I came to tell you
that I'd be honored

to pay for the entire thing.

Well, in that case, maybe
I could sneak you in.

Oh, you won't regret it, sir.

It will be a lovely ceremony.

It had better be!

Now bug off, Killemoff.

BONEHEAD: Hey,
welcome back, Doc.

How was the trip?

Excellent.

That bloated bug walked
right into my trap.

Soon you lunkheads
will be looking

at the new Czar of Smogula!


TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
There was only one

man in all of Tromaville
who was jealous

of my upcoming nuptials.

You guessed it.

Mayor Grody.

He still had hopes of
marrying Gerba himself

and becoming Czar
Zosta's son-in-law.

Finally, he saw his big moment.

What is it, Gerba?

Look!

Frozen yogurt!

I'm really into health foods.

Which flavor do you want?

All of em!

Oh, hey, what's this?

A surprise bridal shower?


I hope it's one of those
where everyone brings a dish.

All they had left was broccoli.

She's gone!

There's something
suspicious about this.

It's not like Gerba to run off
when there's food on the way.

Uh oh!

My tromatons are kicking in!

It's those tire tracks!

There's something
evil about them.

I'll just bet there's some
connection between them

and my missing bride-to-be.

GERBA: Are we at the
bridal shower already?

Oh, is that barbecue I smell?

Just bring me half a cow.

I want to leave
room for dessert.

Ta-da!

Oh, you must be
the male stripper.

No!

I'm the true love of your life.

Can't you see?

We're two of a kind.

Forget Toxie.
Meh.

Marry me.

I'm bugs about you.

Yeah, well, you've won me
over, mysterious stranger.

What girl could resist such a
romantically dashing approach?

Take me!

I'm yours!


This will be just a
little fling, you realize.

Nothing heavy.

TOXIE: Gerba?

What's going on here?

Uh.

Toxie?

Thank goodness you're here!


This horrible thing
tried to take advantage

of my girlish innocence.

And worse than that, he
stole Mayor Grody's limousine.

Take that, you beast!

It's some kind of
weird martian creature.

I'll take care of him.

Shoo.

Scat.

Go back to your own planet.

Oh, my brave, hunky hero!

I am the luckiest girl
in the entire universe.

Mwah!


TOXIE (VOICEOVER):Finally,
the big day

arrived-- along with the
Smogulan wedding party.

Actually, I was
pretty impressed.

Are you with the groom's
family or the bride's?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't notice your mandible.

TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
in his Island City penthouse,

Dr. Killemoff was about to put
his vicious scheme into action.

All right, men.

I'm about to put my
vicious scheme into action.

Is there an echo in here?

Nah.

You're just hearing things.

Hearing things.

Hearing things.

Round up the Radiation
Rangers and wait for my signal.

Right, boss!

I can't wait to return
to the planet Smogula

as their new leader.

Best of all, the TV reception
is so much better there.

Dearly beloved, let the
wedding ceremony begin.

Hit it!

[music playing]

bride and groom so happy,

but I feel so doomed.

Cause while they're
off on their honeymoon,

I'll sit all alone in
my cramped little room.

I guess I'm doomed
to a life of gloom

until they put me in my tomb.

(HIGH-PITCHED SINGING)



Do you, Princess Gerba,
take this hideously deformed

creature of superhuman
size and strength

to be your awfully
wedded husband?

You bet your antenna I do.

And do you, Toxie,
take this incredibly

gorgeous specimen of womanhood
for your woof-- I mean, wife?

What are my choices again?

He does already.

Now get on with it!

I'm starved!

If there's anyone present
who sees any reason why

these two should not be join
edin marriage, let him speak now

or forever keep a lid on it.

I hate to interrupt
this touching scene,

but I'm about toover
throw Czar Zosta.

It'll just take a second.

Hit the deck, insects!



Killemoff, you'll pay for this!

Just send me the bill!


Toxic Crusaders,
it's clean up time!

That's all I needed to hear.

Ah-- choo!

Hey, fellas!

Have some punch.

It's a knockout!

Watch this, Toxie's mom.

It's called lawn bowling.

Ooh, boy.

You got a perfect strike.

Someone get me out of here!

That's a royal command!

Don't worry, future
father-in-law.

I'll handle this.


Here.

Let me help you to your feet--
or whatever those things are.

Son, in exchange
for freeing us,

I'm postponing the muck missile
attack on Tromaville til

next Tuesday.

Gosh.

And I thought you
were a bad guy.

I am.

You just happened to
catch me on an off day.

DR. KILLEMOFF: Why do these
things always happen to me?

I'll get you for
this, Killemoff!

You can run, but
you cannot hide!

Sorry about the
interruption, Gerba.

We can get on with
the wedding now.

Ah, forget it, zits for brains.

I decided to marry someone else.

This is the famous
Chef Wolfgang Yuck.

We have so much in common.

Come on, Woflie.

Let's go back to
Smogula and get to know

each other over four or five
dozen of your famous pizzas.

Hot diggity dogs.

Now you won't have to
marry that bow-wow Gerba.


Yvonne, did you
hear the good news?

Gerba dumped me.

I'm all yours.

That's the best news I've heard
since my last dental checkup.

Doesn't that wedding
cake give you some ideas?

It sure does.

Wouldn't it be a shame
to let it go to waste?

It sure would.

Come on, guys.

Chow time!

All right!

Save me some icing.


Come with me, darling.

I'll make you a nice
bowl of matzah ball soup.
