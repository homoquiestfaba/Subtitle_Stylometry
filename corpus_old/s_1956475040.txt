"More Power" by DeLon

Crime rose in Los Angeles.

Violent crime spiked about 20 %
in the nation's second largest city.

There have been 280 homicides
in LA, up 10 % from last year.

The number of rapes increased 6.4 %

and aggravated assaults are up
more than 27 %.

Alf 21 LAPD
divisions are recording ctime increases.

Police attribute
some of this year's ctime spike

to a resurgence of gang violence this summer.

How many we lookin' at?

Just the four, maybe five.

Neither ever roll too deep when conducting.

Fuck these dope-dealing motherfuckers.

So, another time we see a moral code
turn into a law is about 2000 BC

during the Mesopotamia Era.

During that time, a law was invented
by a man named Hammurabi

and the exact law is what?

"If a man has destroyed the
eye of the man of the gentleman class

they shall destroy his eye."

An eye for an eye.

You guys remember that, right?

Who doesn't know that one, right?

So, what we have to learn, though, is that
ethics is an important part of a system,

Right? We're in a social system,
and we wanna Kinda operate together

with some sort of ethical
and moral boundaries.

That's kinda how justice became what it is

because people operate outside
of that ethical system.

When a government cannot exercise
justice any longer, on its group

is when a government gets overthrown.

So, shouldn't our government
be overthrown by now?

Uh, elaborate.

There's no real justice anymore.

Most laws today do more for keeping criminals
out of jail and on the streets.

And cops use the law to harass the innocent
and exploit minorities.

Yeah, l mean, l do see your perspective,

Um, but here, we have due process.

So, people are innocent until proven guilty,
$0 people do have a chance, right?

To show that they haven't done
anything wrong.

Ultimately, keep in mind that we're all here,
we're all thriving.

We're in one of the best countries
in the world.

We're all in class,
we're all learning, right?

So, l do believe the law system works.
And l think it's important.

Hey, babe. L know I'm late. I'm sorry.

It's OK, we're late too.
We've been stuck in the worst traffic.

There must've been an accident
or something.

Oh, you're late, too? Well...

How's my sweetheart doing?
Is she OK?

School's out for the summer now, right?

Yeah. Traffic sucks, Dad.

Oh, wait a minute now!

Who taught you how to talk like that?

Audra, d'you teach her to talk like that?
That would be you. That was definitely you.

Oh, right. That's been me, huh?

Honey, I don't know what to do.

L think we should just get out
and walk at this point.

No, no, no. You guys take your time, OK?

Oh, l haven't even started
cooking dinner yet.

OK, yeah, don't worry about that, I'll do it.
You know I love looking dinner.

All good.
0K, thanks, sweetie.

Um, honey, l think l gotta let you go.
I need to figure out where I'm going.

Well, look, uh, are you using the GPS?

L know how to get home, Nolan.

Actually, l think...
I think l found a short-cut.

OK. Alright, well, look, be careful. OK?

OK. Love you.

No, my daughter's with her right now.

So, how long until l can report it, though?

No, ... no, l understand.

That's... that's fine. That's OK. Alright.

OK, thanks. Alright. Alright, bye.

Hey, Audra, it's me.
I've been calling a couple times now.

Give me a call when you get this. Please.

Alright, look. I'm on my way
to try and find you guys.

DOORBELL RINGS

Jesus, Audra, you scared me half to death,

Dr Nolan Cooray?

Yes.

I'm Detective Chuck Bryant,
and this is my partner

Detective Emily Plaza.

We, uh...

We're very sorry to have to, uh...

Uh, Dr Cooray, I'm afraid it's about
your wife and daughter.

Nah.

Do you recognise any of them?

Take your time.

That one.

The third from the left?

Good.

Thank you.

Your family witnessed a murder.

Rival gang.

They were in turn gunned down

because, uh, they wanted the identity
of the assailant to remain secret.

HE SNIFFS

That's it?

Seems like your family was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

You know, we're gonna nail this guy.

But that's it.

That's the only reason they were killed?
For that?

You know, I've been in Homicide, Doctor,
for more than eight years now, and uh...

and believe me, there is never,
ever a good reason,

That's it.

We'll do the best we can on this thing.

In fact, there was a witness
that we've identified

and we do have one suspect in custody.

L wanna see him.

Can l see him?

Alright... alright.

I'm gonna write him up, and then...

I'll make that happen for you. Alright?

KNOCK ON DOOR

Thank you, Detective.

Can you come with me, please?

Thank you.

Hey...

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

I'm gonna ask a couple questions.

Amanda.

Date of birth?
Uh, June 4th, 1987.

Mm-hm.,

Your every move is...

being recorded.

Oh. It's a good thing I'm handcuffed
and whispering.

Yeah.

Are you Catholic, Trigger?

Uh, until l reached the age of reason.

Is, uh... "Trigger" your given name?

Am l being detained?

Yeah, I'd say that you were being detained.

OK. That's a different discussion then,
entirely.

You're being detained,
and you're being interrogated.

What am l being charged with?

What have we got? Um, assault,
attempted murder, and maybe even murder.

Wow. Glad you guys didn't pick me up
for that jaywalking.

There were other assailants as well,
but our witness was unable to ID them.

Naturally, we'll assume they were members
of Trigger's posse.

We figure we'll stick him in a vice
and clamp it shut.

Maybe he'll rat out the others
in exchange for leniency.

Well, that's not exactly true.

But zoologist... that was up my alley.

To work with your mother.

I'm sure you loved putting pins
in butterflies when you were a child.

HE SCOFFS

Viceroy butterfly's not poisonous.

It looks exactly like a monarch butterfly,
the orange ones we see the most.

They're very poisonous.

Birds don't eat it
or they get stomach aches and die

but...

They don't bother the monarch

cos it looks like what's poisonous

and if you take the insides out of a monarch
and leave it on the sidewalk

a bird'll leave it alone.

That fascinates me

and it should fascinate you,
because you're talkin' to a monarch.

Trust me.

Leniency, he's not gonna get.

This is a game, and it's ridiculous.

L didn't kill anybody,
1'd like to talk to a lawyer

and l would like that known.

You can pretend you didn't hear me,
but I'm saying out loud, this is enough.

I'd like to talk to my lawyer,
since I'm being detained.

You guys wanna get sucked off or...
what should we do now?

The view's pretty amazing.

You can see Catalina,
if you look to the right.

So, it's super important
we get these done tonight.

L don't really think drinking's
part of the job.

Uh, it is. If you work hard enough,
you can celebrate.

Cheers.

You look pretty.

Please don't touch me.
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

L apologise for overstepping my boundary.

You're a hell of an employee.
Thank you.

To you bein' a hell of an employee...

l will cheers to that.
OK.

Sometimes l just get carried away
at how pretty you are

and how smart you are.

Thank you.
Yeah, well...

l will respect your wishes, Becky.
Let's just do this.

SHE SIGHS

What's the matter? You've stopped typing.

Ooh...

l don't know, l feel...

funny.
You feel funny?

I don't know.

L didn't really eat anything today.

Well, the wine'll help.

No, l feel... something's wrong.

Maybe you're overheated. Maybe just put that,
put that hair back a little.

Please don't touch me.

Was l touching you?

No. Go away.

Where would l go? This is my house.

No...

SHE EXHALES
You're tired.

L see the way you walk around the office.

No, no-no-no. No.

My Sleeping Beauty.

So, why would l want a topless maid?

If l want a maid I'm gonna fuck,
I'm just gonna fuck her.

L don't need her to come here
as a topless maid.

And then you're paying for that?

A topless maid is just gonna dust your dick.

Just send me someone to clean the house!

L don't need a topless maid.
1 got... everyone l know's topless.

Find me someone who's weatin'
an extra sweater but can clean!

You can have it all.

You guys can all have it!

Money won't get you out of this one, Harold.

Now... you are gonna admit to me
that you drugged and raped these women.

HE GROANS

We should just fuckin' kill him.

Alright! OK. L did it. L was just havin' fun.

Thank you.

You guys are crazy.

If you say anything about tonight

Illegal possession...

Can't walk away from this one.

All counts against you, this time around.

You shouldn't have gone after them,

l shouldn't have had to.

The prosecution is sympathetic
to your position,

He believes it was grief that caused your,
uh, temporary lack of judgment.

And he's agreed to reduce the charges.

Attempted murder...
assault with a deadly weapon.

But, um, you're gonna have to plead guilty.

What? That's sympathetic to my position?

I have to plead guilty?

Look--
Uh, that's not justice!

L mean, no offence, but that's not justice.

It's not a matter of whether you attacked
these guys or didn't.

There's plenty of witnesses.

You're gonna do time,
it's just a matter of how much.

Listen.

We go to trial with this, it's gonna take
over a year to even get there.

It carries a much longer sentence
if convicted.

Take the deal.

on how to stay the fuck alive in here.

Yeah. I'm startin' to realise that.

What's your name anyway?

Hank.
Nolan. Thank you, seriously.

No problem.
What are you doin' here?

I'm a lawyer.
Hank the lawyer, huh?

Man, l don't even know how l got here,
to be honest with you.

Well, most people who commit crimes
end up here.

Well, if tryin' to kill the man who killed
my family is a crime

1 guess I'm a criminal.

Stay outta trouble.

Don't worry, we'll get you fixed up.

You're pretty brave for a new guy.

But you got a serious death wish,
takin' on Cam.

Yeah, well, people keep telling me that,
but...

l just didn't want to get raped today.

I've never had to fight like this.

Look. The only language they speak
in this place...

is violence.

It's Kill... or be killed.

It's a different world in here.

And you speak it, or sooner or later
you're gonna get popped.

Yeah, well, l don't know the first thing.

Not about knowing. It's about survival.

The ones who make it out...
align themselves with a group.

For protection.

There's safety in numbers.

Or you can, uh,
just learn to fight like heck.

Yeah, well, maybe I'll go for the latter.

HE LAUGHS

Well, good luck on that.

Name's Jackson, by the way.

L don't know about makin' friends
with guards either, though.

Oh...

So you don't wanna make nice with the inmates

and you don't wanna make nice
with the guards.

Shit, man...

For a second there l thought
you were really serious

about getting out of this hole

in one piece.

Look, man. I'm sorry.

The name's Nolan,

I'm just in way over my head.

And ll don't really know what to do.

L understand.

You're lucky Hank saved your ass.

So... who is that guy?

Hank Carmac.

Does pro-bono work here in the prison

for inmates he feels were locked up unjustly.

Self-made man, lives by a code.
It's rare for a lawyer.

How'd he learn to fight like that?

L don't know,
but word is he's a military man

passed the bar, got his law degree
on the government dime and never looked back.

Hmm. Man on a mission, huh?

Trust me, Hank is a man you should have
in your corner.

You know me too well, Chris, Cheers,

Sorry we're late.

L hate it when someone's
supposed to pick you up

and they're a half hour late

cos l always find myself staring
at my cell phone wondering what that's for.

Ah, you know how she is.

Some asshole decided to go on
a shooting spree over at China Garden

and l got caught up.

Thank you.

What you got?

Interesting case.

This guy l met inside the Pen. Take a look.

Come on, Hank!

Beat some down, help some get out?

Ah, come on, Amanda. You know the deal.
Justice is case by case, you know that.

This guy, his family was killed.

People that did it killed the only witness.
Strangled her.

So, they walked.

So, what's he doin' in lockdown?

Just what you'd be doin', man.
Bashin' heads. Tryin' to stay alive.

The Keystone Cops are real proud
of themselves, l guess.

Of all the sorry bastards in the cage

almost every one of them screams
he got a bad deal on the daily.

you've gotta get back to the freedom,

Yeah, man. He has been instrumental.

HANK SIGHS

You know, when l first took your case

I thought l was lookin' at a man
with principle

a man who wanted to satisfy justice.

L was protecting myself, Hank.

OK.

Because the last think l need
is for you to be in the hole

right before l can get you out,
you understand?

This system doesn't work, Hank.
You're the one who taught me that, right?

Nolan, do you wanna get out of here?

You know, l used to lecture my students
on having faith in the law?

L used to think that America was founded
on some sort of truth and justice.

This country is turning into
a piece of shit, Hank!

And I'm in the fucking hole!
I'm in the fucking hole!

For what?

My family was kKilled!

Trigger should be in this fuckin' hole!

Yes. Yes, he should.

But I'm using my time...

my resources, my energy.

L could be having dinner, l could be fucking
right now but I'm here with you.

And I'm just asking for two damn months.
Two months. That's it.

Man, l got nothing out there anyway.

Come on, Nolan,
stop feeling fucking sorry for yourself.

You got even less in here and you know it.

What happened to Cam anyway?

Cam?

I don't give a fuck about Cam

and nor should you, that piece of shit...

shot a young girl in the face, 17 years old.

Even after she emptied the register.
Now l told you...

to keep it low-key, not to fuckin' worry
about other criminals in here. You hear me?

Yeah, l hear you, man.

Good. Cos the next time,
you kick him harder. OK?

THEY SNIGGER

You trust me, right?
Of course l do.

Good.

So give me a reason to trust you.

We are almost there.

And l promise you,
I'll get you outta this place.

But keep your nose clean, OK?

Yeah. L will.

See you soon.

Yeah, alright.

Dr Cooray, you've served 12 months
of a two-year sentence.

Would you say you feel rehabilitated?

Dr Cooray?

L feel he is.

Been a model prisoner.

A hard worker, too.

And always does as he is told.

Hm.

Well, it says here he's gotten
into a few scrapes during his stay.

Spent some time in solitary confinement.

That is true.

But l was present for all

and they were definitely cases
of self-preservation.

Well, l see you got Hank Carmac, Esquire
representing you today.

Yes, sir.

Sir, we are well aware of your efforts
to rehabilitate inmates.

Given, you are his lawyer

but are you also saying that you would
vouch for him personally?

Absolutely, sir. He's a good man.

I think he's served enough time

to reflect upon his single instance of bad
behaviour due to the...

tragic, terrible loss of his family.
His wife, his child.

I know he takes full responsibility
for his actions

and has expressed to me many times
his desire to get back to work

as a teacher at the International University,
where he feels...

frankly, as do I,
he can contribute positively

to the young minds of this country.

Ahem. Dr Cooray...

if you were to be released

is there any chance that you may
again seek retribution

for the wrong that you feel's
been committed against you?

Absolutely not, sir,

l made a big mistake.

L should leave law enforcement
up to the professionals.

And l promise you l pose no threat
to the people outside of these walls.

L know what l did was wrong

and l've realised that now.

And l am truly sorry.

Hey, Nolan, you know of a place
called the Soi Dog Tavern?

Nah.
Well, cool little bar.

Every Wednesday night, me and my friends,
we get together.

Shoot the shit, drink some shit.

You should come and join us one night.

Thank you, man.
L do appreciate that, brother. For real.

Of course.

L know you got things to do,
put your life back on track but...

Open invitation.

SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

As l live and breathe, what you doin' here?

Hey!
And so soon!

L didn't think 1'd see you this soon,
if at all. How are you?

Come on, meet my friends.
This is Damian, my good friend.

Hey, man. How are you?

This is Amanda.

Hey. We've heard a lot about you.
Hey! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

Kimberly, Chris, could you hook us up
with some drinks?

Let's catch up.
Absolutely!

Bryant and Plaza.
They worked point on your case, right?

Do you know them?

Good cops. Both of them.

Rare things these days.
It is.

Amanda's one of those.
She wears a badge, too.

Really?
=L try.

And these two misfits, believe it or not,
used to be partners.

Yeah, until l took early retirement.

Due to excessive use of force, they said.

Yeah, he split the wig
of an unarmed dope pusher.

HE LAUGHS
That dope pusher was a stone-cold killer.

And if l didn't take him out,
he was gonna kKill someone else.

Makes a good point.

Things have spiralled
out of control in the city.

Yeah, seems like that.

Yaba is to this city
what Molly is to Coachella.

Yeah, what happened to you,
where the guilty go free?

Happens more than the PD
would want you to know.

Gettin' off on technicalities, plea bargains,
dead witnesses. You name it.

You know, they are releasing violent felons
because there's overcrowding in prisons.

The system is broken.

Well, you know why?
Cos they give more of a fuck

about the rights of the criminals
than they do the victims.

And even when we do get the perps,
sometimes we can't make the evidence stick.

Even when it's obvious who the guilty are.

You know, l looked at your case.

They strangled your witness, huh?

Yeah, man, I'm still tryin' to figure out
how to get this fucker behind bars.

You don't need bars.

We've found other ways
to deal with those assholes.

Really?
Yeah.

You guys vigilantes or somethin'?

Why? You curious?

You damn right I'm curious.

You know, there are over 300 homicides
a year in this city?

Despite what they tell you,
hard drugs are on the rise.

This new strain of yaba's deadly.

It's a blend of crystal meth and caffeine.

Instant addiction.

My parents, they used to leave their
doors unlocked.

Mine too.

Now good people like that
are afraid to go out after dark.

If you're afraid to open your front door
cos you don't know who's on the other side

you're livin' in fear.
Yep.

And if you're not afraid,
you just don't know how bad it's got.

Innocent people, gettin' killed every day.

The gitl that gets raped,
what happened to you...

me and my family.

It's fuckin' wrong.
Good people are livin' in fear.

Nowhere, money. L run this shit.

Mm. "Yo, money," huh? Motherfucker.

You're too fuckin' stupid to run anything.

Where the fuck did you get it?

Fuck you, Hank!

Hey... you listen to me.

L have shit to lose, too.
And you can trust me on this.

I've thought about this long and hard, OK?

Comes down to a simple fuckin' science.

Someone has to deliver justice
to these fucking criminals.

You feel good about Trigger
still bein' out there, huh?

Know he can kill another kid, another woman,
destroy another fuckin' family

like he did yours, like he did mine?

That was different!
How? How?

Cos these motherfuckers,
they don't play fair!

They do not play by the rules, OK?

They don't respect Amanda.
They don't respect me, you

or any motherfucker!

You think we would have got Jinx
if we weren't here? Huh?

You think he would've handed over Omari
just like that? Wake the fuck up, Nolan!

Wake up!

See, we don't need search warrants.
We don't need due fuckin' process.

We solve the case, we give it to the cops.
Hand it to 'em with a fucking bow on top.

That's what we do here!

Just gonna get out and do it again, man.
So next time we will fucking Kill him.

You hear me?

You're crazy. You know that, right?

Maybe... yeah, maybe.

But l guess some motherfucker has to be, huh?

Look, I'm sure l don't have to remind you,
Nolan, how important it is

for you, uh, to keep this discreet.

Listen, Wanda Esparza had some
DNA on her that l think that we missed.

What?
Yeah. Uh...

Oh, shit.
L should have told you, but um...

I'm looking for this guy Trigger.

Alright? L want to talk to him.
I wanna get DNA, a sample from him.

So, you think that Trigger
may have done it himself?

Eh, Wanda Esparza was strangled.

And they found some fingernails
on her clothing and...

you know, you ask me? Do the math.
One plus one equals motherfucking two.

Yeah.

Yep.
That's why we break the rules, man.

Beautiful, isn't it?

Yeah.

But not as beautiful as it used to be.

So, how'd you get here?

What do you mean?
Y'know, like, here. You know?

Doin' what you do.

L used to have a beautiful family
like you once.

A beautiful wife.

Here...

l always keep it with me.

Man, she is beautiful.
Yeah.

Aryan convict named Krieger took it all away.

L was tryin' a case, l won.
I put him away for life.

He sent his boys round to the house.

L wasn't there,

My wife was.

They went for her,

They violated her.

Beat her, so badly...

she didn't wake up for six months.
When she did, she left.

Blamed me for all of it.

Two years later,
they found her hanging in her closet, dead.

Suicide.

Jesus.

L guess those racist fucks did kill her,
right?

Just took her two years to die.

Hank, man, I'm so sorry.

They're still out there, Nolan.
Somewhere. They never found 'em.,

HANK SIGHS

Anyway, we got you out.
Yeah, we did.

You're a good man.

You too, my man.

Guess what?
What?

One of my snitches, a working girl

got Trigger's DNA from a blunt
they smoked together.

The DNA?

Matches the fragment on Wanda's body.

Our lab confirmed it?

Yep. And we have a warrant,

We got the son of a bitch!
Yeah.

Alright, Plaza.
Thank you, Detective.

Alright.

Nolan, it's Detective Bryant,

Look, l shouldn't even really
be telling you this

but we've got a warrant
for Vincent Trano, "Trigger".

We've got him.

Hey, boys.

Detective!

How are you?

What are you doin' here?

Did you find him?

We're workin' on it.

What? L mean, what does that mean?

It means that l went to the man's house.
He wasn't there.

L talked to his mother.
She said she hadn't seen him in months.

Right. And you believed her?

Look, there's no love lost between those two.

Alright? He's not a model son.

Right, so he's probably hiding out
at a friend's house or somethin'.

Yeah, yeah, probably. But you know what?

We can't knock down every door
in the hood lookin' for his ass.

OK? He could be anywhere.

We're gonna get him this time,
don't you worry.

"Don't worry"?

"Don't worry", Detective?

How the hell are you gonna tell me that?

Every time we get close to bringin' Trigger
to justice, this guy frickin' disappears.

You let us do our job.

Right, yeah. You guys do your job.

Frankly, this was my last hope, Detective.
Honestly.

And you guys can't even find him!

We have DNA on him.
It's just a matter of time.

L understand. But then what happens?

He's gonna get off on some technicality
and then he's back on the streets.

You know what?
You need to let the wheels of justice roll.

You're tired. Go home.
You're beat, you're whooped. Get some rest.

I'll call you, let you know, you know,
if 1 talk to anybody.

If l get some more information. Alright?

OK, alright.
Alright, but find him for me, please.

Please.

Alright.

What's up, Ponds? Covington.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

Nolan. What are you doing here?

Hey.

So, l got a call from Detective Bryant.
They have a warrant out for Trigger's arrest.

And?
And so l came in to check in on it.

They find him?

No.

And you still have the nerve
to act surprised.

Look. All l want to say is...

you being here is making me
a little uncomfortable.

You either do things our way

or you keep clinging to the shipwreck
we call law and order.

But you don't try and keep your feet stuck
in both worlds.

Last time l remembered, you're still a cop,
right, Amanda?

I'm not a cop.

I'm a scout.

If we don't have intel, we got nothing.

Detective Bryant is a good cop.

But he's an idealist.

I'm a realist.

Yeah, alright. L get it.

Even if Trigger goes down,
it's for killing a snitch.

Not for what he did
to your wife and daughter.

Ask yourself, is that really justice?

One minute he's breaking down some dealer,
and the next he's at the station

chatting with detectives.

L mean, for such a smart guy,
he seems pretty confused.

No shit. How the fuck can you be so sure
this guy's not gonna flip?

Like l keep tellin' you,
l think he's one of us.

Look, Hank. L can't say l have
your confidence in the guy...

but I trust your judgment.
HANK SIGHS

Fuck me, guys.
Look, look, l think he's got his head

wrapped around this Trigger guy,
if I'm honest.

That might clear him a bit, sure.
But it's easier said than done.

The cops have been tossing
every nook and cranny in this barrio

and still haven't found jack-shit.

He's probably already south of the border.

.
C'mon, man.

He's made this city his fuckin' home.
There's no way he's leaving.

How the hell can you be so sure of that?

Would you?

You got a gun, Amanda. You got a badge.

And you got a fuckin' passport
to wherever that fuck might be holed up.

So, go find him.

And find him your way.

Get it done, Amanda.

Hey.

Hey.

So, we heard you went to the PD yesterday.

Look, l already told Amanda...

Yeah, we know.

They're not gonna find him, are they?

Nope. Not the legit way.

So, l guess you can continue sittin' around
on your ass doing nothing

waiting for a system that keeps failing you,
or you can, uh...

you can do something about it, Nolan,

Fuck it. I'm in.

'Bout time. Get moving, Nolan.

I'll see it... and I'll raise it.

How much is that?

Will you match that for me, honey?
Just one white and blue there.

Walit, it's my turn. L go after him,

You tell her.
Clockwise.

You can't do that, I'm supposed...
You know what? Fuck it. All in.

Ha!
Big boy.

L don't even have that much.
You went to college?

Well, if you count
Folsom State Prison college, then yeah.

L took a class or two up there.

You're all in?
Yeah.

Did you--
Who put my gun on top of the weed?

That wasn't me.
Whose weed?

One of these girls brought it.
I'm not sure which one.

Never accountable, are you?
You never just say, "l did it."

L don't want to rat anybody out or anything.
0K

Hey, Nolan.
Yeah?

This is for you.

It's loaded. Safety's on.

You're rollin' with the big dudes tonight,
man.

Just stay out of the way
and don't shoot your dick off.

MUFFLED SCREAMS

What are we doing here?

This.

What the hell?

Yeah, you were right.

He snitched. That's why he's out.
No!

He gave up Jinx's whereabouts.

We need intel, so we're gonna find out

You shitched to get out of jail.
Now your boy Omari snitched on you.

You motherfuckers have no honour at all.

Yeah.

Yeah, l gave up some snow-white politicians
trolling for ass in the bartio.

But Trigger gonna kill me if l give him up,
