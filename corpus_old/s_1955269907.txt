Uuh! Good Morning.

Whattup, Katie?

Let Me Guess.

You're Going To
Venice Beach.

Oh, Would You
Stop Foraging?

Sit Down And
Eat Something.

I Can't, Mom. I'm Late.

Wait. Did You
Clean Your Room?

S'why I'm Late.

Hey, Watch It.

Whattup, Dad?

English. That Up.

He'll Be Here.

He Said He'd Be Here.

Maybe Something
Happened To Him.

Maybe He Got Hit By A Car.

Or Maybe His Dad's Back
Started Acting Up Again

And They Had To Rush Him
To The Hospital.

Or Maybe He Got
Kidnapped By Aliens.

Don't Joke. That Happened
To An Uncle Of Mine.

You're A Lunatic.
Do You Know That?

Oh, Man.

Great. This Is
The Weekend.

Do You Know How Long We're Gonna
Have To Wait For The Next Bus?

Yo, Guys. What Up?

Lateness.

My Mom Made Me Clean My
Room Before I Could Leave.

Fine, But We Missed The Bus.

Now We're Gonna Be Late

And Have To Wait
To Use The Pit.

I Don't Think So.

Wait A Minute. Wait.

You're Not Thinking About
Skating To The Beach, Are You?

Why Not, Jordy?

It's Like A Million
Miles Away.

Jordy, Jordy, Jordy.

When You Woke Up This Morning,

Did You Say To Yourself,

"Today I'm Gonna Talk"?

Or "Today I'm Gonna Skate"?

Come On. Put 'Em On.

I Told You Guys,

This Is Gonna Be
The Perfect Start

To The Last Day Of
Summer Vacation.

Oh, Man, Why Did You
Have To Remind Us?

Move It! Come On!

Oh, Yeah.

Come On, Guys.

Come On, Guys. Let's
Get Some Speed.

Stop Saying "Guys" All The Time.

I'm Not A Guy.

It's Just An
Expression.

Yeah? Well, So Is "Cut It
Out Before I Deck You."

Oh, Yeah. Let's Skate!

Yo, Peter. That Was
An Ill Grab, Man.

Jordy, That Was Sweet, Man.

Gabriel, Watch
That Back Leg.

Watch Your Own Back Leg.

Hey, Yo. Check It Out.

<I>He's From Inline Magazine.</I>

What's He Doing Here?

They Must Have
Heard About Us.

Cool.

Let's Go Show 'Em What
Soul Skating's All About.

What's He
Waiting For?

Here We Go. Come On, Boys.

Here We Go. Yeah!

All Right. Come On.
Looking Good.

Move It. Move It.

Ok, Give Me Some
Shots Of The Skates.

Make Sure You Get
The Skates, And Get
Val Center.

Val, Look Hip.
Come On, Look
Edgy.

Team X-Bladz.

Forget Them.

We've Still Got
The Pit, Right?

C'mon, Big Pete.

I Want To See A
540. Let's Go.

Oooh!

Oow. That Hurt.

Oh, Man. You Got Worked.

You All Right, Bro?

He Tried To Go
Bio On A 540.

One And A Half Rotations
Horizontal In The Air.

You Do That, Right?

In My Sleep.

I'm Never Gonna
Get That 540.

Sure You Will, Just Not
Talking Like That.

Jimmy, I'm On A
Tight Schedule Here.

Can We Get These Shots
Somewhere Else?

No. I Gotta Get A Picture
Of The Bladz From The Pit.

I've Just Got To Figure Out How
To Get Rid Of These Losers.

I Know 'Em. I'll Just
Ask 'Em To Leave.

They'll Do That For You?

Of Course.

Try To Throw Your Shoulder
In The Rotation More.

It'll Help You Out.

Right.

Ooow!

Are You Ok?

Yeah. No Problemo.

Yo, Brink. What's Up?

Are You Gonna Do That
At The Invitational

Or Save It For The
Championships?

You What, Val?

I Don't Think You Skate
So Good Anymore, Man.

Maybe You Should Bag
Both Competitions.

Naw. I'd Have To Give
Back All This Cool Stuff.

Ooh, Sponsored
Skaters.

Big Deal.

It Is A Big Deal.

Team X-Bladz Rules.
Everybody Knows That.

Speaking Of Which, We've
Got A Photo Shoot We're
Trying To Do Here.

Mind Getting Lost?

Mind If I Kick Your Butt?

Wait. We Had The
Pit First.

You Know How It Is.

Yeah, But We
Have It Now.

See, You Guys Left The Pit.

B.J.'S Using It.

Aren't You, Beej?

Ah, Man. You Guys Snaked
It And You Know It.

You Guys Should've Left
Someone To Save Your Place.

You Know How It Is.

Val, You Are Such A Jerk.

And That Goes For You Too, Worm.

Hey, Gabriella, Ever
Get Arrested For
Impersonating A Boy?

No. You?

Forget About 'Em.

Maybe In A Couple Of Years
They'll Be Good Enough

And Someone'll Want To Put
Their Pictures In A Magazine.

Maybe Not.

Come On. Let's Go.

Check It Out.
I've Got An Idea.

Excuse Me. Can I Ask You
Guys A Question?

Yeah.

All Skateboarders Aren't
Really Wusses, Are They?

They All Can't Be
No-Talent, No-Skill,

Half-Smart, Inline
Skating Wannabees.

Am I Right?

What Was That?

Personally, I Don't Think
That At All, All Right?

But That's Exactly What Those
Guys Over There Told Us.

Those Guys Said That?

Yeah, Man.

Let's Go.

Oh, That Was Rough, Man.

Val's Gonna Freak.

Hey! I Heard You've
Been Talking About Me.

If He Lives.

You Got Something To Say,

Why Don't You Say It
To My Face, Huh?

You Talking About Me?
You Got Something To Say?

Yo! What's Up, Fam?

It's Just Not
Normal, That's All.

Ralph, Please.

No One Should Be That
Happy All The Time.

What's Wrong With
Being Happy?

He's A Great Kid.

It's Just Not Normal,
That's All.

Do I Have To Go To School?

Why Can't I Be Home
Schooled Like The
Wyatts?

Now, You See, Katie
Is A Normal Child.

Today's The First Day Of
School, And She's Miserable.

Because, Sweetheart, Home
Schooling Is Expensive.

Besides, The Wyatts Are Mormon.

Why Can't We Be Mormons?

I'll Look Into It.

Yo! Let The
Games Begin.

Katie, You're The Future
Of This Family.

Now Go To School.

Are You Ready For Your First
Day Of School, Sweetheart?

Absolutely.

Why Don't You Wear Something

That Doesn't Look Like Somebody
Just Let The Air Out Of It?

Dad, The Kids At School
Are Down With This Style.

How's The Back
Treating You Today?

Thanks, Mom.

Well, If You Ask Me,

I Feel Good Enough
To Be Going Back To
Work Already.

Soon.

Andy, Are You Sure
You Don't Want Me To
Drop You?

Got It Covered.

What's For Lunch, Dad?

What's Your
Least Favorite?

Baloney On White
With Extra Mayo.

That's What I Made For You.

Ah, Yeah!

Hey, Pete, Jordy,
What's Up, Guys?

Hey, You Guys Look Bummin'.

What's Going On?

Nothing Nine More Months Of
Summer Vacation Couldn't Fix.

Did You Guys Hear What
Happened To Gabriella?

Is She Ok?

What Happened?

It's Awful.

What?

She...

It's Too Bad. I Can't Say It.

No.

I'm Seeing Things, Aren't I?

I Didn't Even Know She
Owned One Of Those.

It's A Dress, Man.

Anybody Say Anything And
I'll Hand You A Body Part.

Hey, Gab, Personally, I
Think It's Phat.

Mad Cool.
Right, Guys?

Beautiful.

I Love It.

Yeah. Ok.

Look. My Mom Made Me
Wear This Dress.

"Back In Peru All The Girls
Wear Dresses On The First
Day Of School."

I Was Like, Ma, This Isn't Peru.

She Says, "It Is
If I Say It Is."

Heads Up!

Hey! Give Me Those.

C'mon, Man. Give 'Em Back.

Why Don't You Get Your
Skateboarders Friends
And Make Me?

That Was Pretty Dope, Huh?

Ok, Yeah. I'm Still
Laughing About It.

Now, That's Dope.

Val, What Is Your Problem?

I Thought We Were Only
Gonna Mess With 'Em.

That's What We're Doing.

You Narc On Me,

I'll Know You're A
Bunch Of Wusses.

This Is Just Great!

Here You Go, Man.

If You Don't Lace 'Em Up
They'll Probably Fit You.

See, I Was Planning On Changing
Into Some Real Clothes

When I Got Here.

You Mean You're Gonna Go
Through An Entire First
Day Of School

Wearing...Those...For Me?

Just Take 'Em Before I
Change My Mind, Ok?

Oh, Man, Did You Guys
See That?

Soul Skaters.

Together There's
Nothing We Can't Do.

That's Right, Guys.
Soul Skaters.

Yes!

Right!

Earthworm Is The Common Name

That Is Given To Over 1,000
Different Species Of Worms

<I>In A Class Of The
Annelid Phylum.</I>

Earthworms Are
Cylindrical In Shape.

Yo, Man. Are We Gonna Have
Val On Our Cases All Year?

I Got A Plan.

Brink, My Man,

Val's Not Exactly
Playing With A Full
Deck.

Let's Not Do Anything
We're Gonna Regret.

Shhh.

Hey, What's The Plan?

See Ya, Buddy.

Hey, You're Not
Finished, Man.

What's His
Problem?

He's A Soul Skater.

That's His Problem.

Ewwww!

Is There A Problem, Val?

No. I Thought I Saw
A Bug Or Something.

Well, Get Over It.

Hey, You Know, In
Some Countries

Worms Are Considered
A Delicacy.

Go Figure.

You, Us, Right Now, Out Back.

Say, It's Very Nice, Val.

Have You Ever Thought About
Working With Garbage Cans
For A Living?

Do You Ever Give That
Mouth Of Yours A Rest?

I Don't Know.

Do I?

Personally, I Just Want To
Pound The Snot Outta Ya.

Boomer Suggested A Race Instead.

We Race,

You Win,

We Stop Giving You Beef.

You Lose

And, Man, It's Like Open
Season On Your Butts.

Deal?

Come On.

You Know There's No
Skating Allowed At
School.

Yeah. I Knew You
Couldn't Step Up.

What Did I Tell Ya?

No Heart.

Let's Do It.

Brink, You'll Get
In Trouble, Man.

We're Gonna Have To
Skate Against These
Guys Sooner Or Later.

Why Not Sooner?

Yeah. Why Not?

All Right, We Go
Side By Side.

When You Get To
The Relay Point

You've Got To Slap
The Next Guy's Hand.

Or Girl's Hand.

Thank You.

Whatever. Before He Can Go.

Or She Can Go.

Chrisie, Call The Start.

Let's Go.

All Right, On Your Marks...

You Don't Talk Much.

Get Set...

I Like That
In A Man.

Go!

C'mon, Boomer, You Wuss!

[ Groaning ]

Brink! What
Are You
Doing?

Boomer, Boomer,

Lay Still, Man.

This Happened To Me Last Summer.

Just Lay Still.

Kimball, Get The Nurse And
Some Ice Right Now. Go! Go!

What Are You Doing?

I'm Gonna Have The Nurse
Take A Look At It.

Brink! The Race!

Relax. Just Relax.

You Lost The
Race To Help Me?

Brink, Man, I
Don't Get You.

Take A Number.

What's Going On?

Teacher! Teacher!

Nice.

I Think It's A Record.

I'm Pretty Sure It Is.

Yo, Dad. Please.

What Was It? Four
And A Half Hours

Into The New School Year
Before Being Suspended?

It's Only For Today.

Besides, I Can Explain--

Don't, Don't. I'll
Just Read About It
In The Papers.

A Record Like This Has Got To
Attract Media Attention.

Dad, Val And His Crew
Were Dissing Us,

So We Started Giving
'Em Beef Right Back,

And Then They Wanted To Hit
It Right There At School.

And, Clearly, We Couldn't Step
Off, So We Had To Battle.

Who Are You?

What Have You Done
With My Son?

God, Dad...

Don't They Teach
English At Your
School?

Wait A Minute.

What Am I Asking You For?

You Haven't Been There
Long Enough To Find Out.

Dad, You're Not
Listening To Me.

Sure I Am.

You Got Dissed.
You Ate Beef.

Did I Miss Anything?

Great!

Lovely.

Just Lovely.

Well, Let's Recap, Shall We?

The Car's Gonna Cost Us $900.

The Dentist Called To Say
That If We Don't Spent $300

On Katie's Night Brace,

She's Gonna Have A Smile
Like A Picasso Painting.

I Called Beckman Today To See If
There Was Gonna Be A Job For Me

When My Disability Was Over,

And He Said That He
Couldn't Promise Anything,

And Your Son Was Suspended
From School On His First Day.

So, How Was Your Day?

It Was Fine.

Sell Any Houses?

Ah, No.

Show Any Houses?

No.

Well, Then, Our
Troubles Are Over.

Oh, Come On. Be Nice.

I'm Sorry.

It's Gonna Be Ok.

We Have Been Through
Much Worse Than This.

If You Say So.

Ralph, Do You
Remember When You
Fell Off That Beam?

We Didn't Even Know If You
Were Gonna Walk Again.

Yeah. I'd Say
That Was Worse.

And Now Look At You--

Strutting Around. You Can't
Wait To Get Back To Work.

All I Need Is My Job Back.

Don't Worry About The Money.

We're Gonna Be Ok.

The Mortgage Isn't Due Until
The First Of The Month.

Well, There Was Screaming
And Then Yelling,

And Then There Was
Crying And Hugging.

It Was All Very Peruvian.

How Did Your Fam
Deal With It, Jordy?

Well, There Was
Sitting And Staring,

And Afterwards There Was
Some More Sitting And
Staring.

And For All I Know, My
Parents Are Still In The
Living Room...

Sitting And Staring.

Well, Jerry Handled It Kinda The
Way It Was Done At Gabriella's--

There Was Screaming, Yelling,
Crying, And Hugging.

Only Without The Hugging.

My Mother Was Conveniently
Hiding In The Next Room.

Hey, At Least You
Got Two Parents.

I Got A Mom And A Jerry.

Do The Math.
That's One Parent.

Look, Guys, Things Got A
Little Out Of Hand The
Other Day, You Know.

We Gotta Chill And
Let Things Blow Over.

All Right?

Hey, Check It Out.
Jerkweeds At 2:00.

Hiya, Children.

Excuse Me,
But I Believe

We Out-Skated Your Sorry
Butts Yesterday, Old Man.

Any Time You Want To
Go At It Again--

Cut It Out.

I Guess You Heard
About Boomer?

Yeah. How Long's
He Gonna Be Out?

A Couple Of Weeks.

For Sure, He's Out
Of The Invitational.

Means There's An Open
Spot On The Team.

Ha Ha. Yeah, Right.

Like We're Gonna Try
Out For Team X-Bladz.

Like Any Of You
Have The Talent?

I'm Telling You So You Grommets
Know You're Not Invited.

Good. You Told Us.

Now Beat It!

You Don't Get It, Do You?

Being A Sponsored
Skater Is Cool.

I Get All The Newest Gear
Whenever I Need It,

I Get My Picture In Every
Skating Magazine On The Planet--

Oh, Now I'm Nauseous.

And I Make A Lot Of Money.

Just Think
About That--

Being Known
As The Best,

And Getting Paid
At The Same Time.

What Could Be Sweeter?

Hey, Look.

We Don't Care About
Any Of That Stuff.

We Skate For Fun.

We're Soul Skaters.

Right, Brink?

Right.

Why Is It That The
Losers Always Say
They're In It For Fun?

C'mon On.

Can You Believe That Guy?

Skatin' For Money.

What A Sell-Out.

Think He'll Show?

You Know It.

Ok, Dude, Give Us The 540.

I Want To See It Laid
Out And Inverted.

You Can Do It.

Aw, Man.

There's Gotta Be A Better
Way To Do This.

There Is. Don't Fall.

You Ok, Dude?

Yeah, Man.

Hey, What's Up
With You Today?

You're Looking So Sketchy.

Nothing. I'm Fine.

Cool.

Guy, I've Got To Get Going.

I've Got This Family Thing
To Do This Afternoon.

Wait A Minute.

What About Our Session?

The Invitational's In Two Weeks.

It's The Last Competition
Before The Championship.

Yeah, I Know.

Look. You Guys Keep On Training.

And, Peter, Keep
Working On That 540.

And I'll Do Some Of My Own
Stuff On My Own, All Right?

Ok.

All Right.

Bye.

All Right. That's It For Now.

I've Got Your Numbers.

I'll Call You If You Made It.

What About Brad?

No Good. Too Buckled.

Right?

Yeah.

Markoff?

No Way. Nobody Wants
To Session With Him.

We Only Need Him
For One Month.

And After That, We Never
Got To Talk To Him Again.

What Do You Think, Beej?

I Don't Think So.

Too Bad Your Secret Weapon
Was A No-Show.

I Don't Believe It.

What Did I Tell Ya?

Watch This.

No Way, Man. No Way.

How Much?

What?

How Much Does
X-Bladz Pay?

How Much?

Well, $200 A Week.

Plus All Equipment.

Plus An Extra $200
Bonus For Each Of Us

When We Win Tournaments,

But There's No Way
I'm Gonna Let You On
The Team.

Well, There's No Way
I Wanted To Be Here

But I Need The Money.

What For, Grandma
Needs A New Kidney?

Besides, I Thought You
Were--What Do You Guys
Call That--

Oh, Soul Skater.

So, How About
You Turn Around

And Soul Skate
On Out Of Here.

Yeah, Brink, Get Out Of Here.

Fine.

Wait A Second.

You've Got 30
Seconds. Street Run.

One Chance.

Time's Up.

How Are You On Vert?

Just As Good As Street.
Maybe Better.

Downhill?

I Can Do It All.

How About Peter
And The Rest?

They Know You're
Doing This?

This Is Gonna Be Good.

I Can't Wait To See The
Look On Their Faces.

No Way.

This Is Just Through
The Invitation

Till Boomer's Back
On His Feet.

If This Gets Out, Then I
Don't Skate With You,

And You've Got Nobody.

Got That?

Hey, We Won't
Say Anything,

But You Have To Be
At Every Practice.

All Right.

And, Uh, No More Bagging On
Me In Front Of People.

From Now On, You Start
Showing Me Some Respect.

You Got That?

Yeah. I Got It.

Let's Go See Jimmy.

Oooh! You Went Big
There, My Man.

You See, Andy--

Do You Mind If I
Call You Andy?

Brink. I Like Brink.

Brink. I
Love That.

Brink. Ha Ha Ha.

See, That's What X-Bladz
Is All About-- Going Big.

I'm In 1,200 Outlets Nationwide.

Last Year I Moved Over
10 Million Dollars'
Worth Of Merchandise.

And All Because Of Team X-Bladz.

So, I Guess The Big Question Is,

Are You Ready To Go
Big For X-Bladz?

Big As You Want.

Did You Hear That?

As Big As I Want.

You Better Watch Your Back.

This Boy Here's Liable
To Put You Out Of A Job.

Don't Worry About That, Jimmy.

So, Val Told You About The
Money And How That Works.

You're Ok With That, Right?

Yeah.

All Right. Then
It's Official Then.

You're Part Of The Team.

From Now On, There'll
Be No Competing

Unless You're Flying
The X-Bladz Colors.

You Got That?

All Right.

I'm Gonna Need You 24/7 For
Like Photo Shoots, Promos,

Industry Shows,
Stuff Like That.

Ok.

Ok.

Well, Then...

Parents?

Your Parents Know
About This?

My Parents?

Yeah. They Down With This?

Oh, My Parents. Yeah.

All Right. Ok.

Well, Then, Welcome
To Team X-Bladz.

S'up, Katie?

What's In The Bag?

Just My Stuff.

You Got More
Stuff Now Than
When You Left.

What's In The Bag?

Nunya.

Nunya?

Nunya Business.

A-Haa A-Haa.

Great.

Wait A Second.

Oh, Man, What Am I Doing?

Katie, Why Don't You
Slow Down A Little Bit?

What's The Point Of
Having A Fast Metabolism
If I Don't Use It?

She's Got Something There.

Andy, Are You Ok?

You've Hardly Eaten Anything.

Uh, With Dad Not Working.

I Think That Maybe
It's Time I Got A Job

To Help Out Around Here.

You Know, With The
Money And Stuff.

Oh, Andy, That Is A
Wonderful Offer,

But You Don't Have To Do That.

Mr. Beckman's Gonna
Give Dad His Job Back.

And I Just Showed A House
Today To Some People.

I Think They're
Very Interested.

No, No, No.
Wait A Second.

I Think It's Good.

What Kind Of A Job Are
You Talking About?

Well, I Know These Kids Who
Make Extra Money Skating.

Skating?

Yeah. See, They Got
On A Sponsored Team

And The Sponsor Pays Them To
Wear Their Gear And Stuff.

It's Kind Of Like Advertising.

I Thought You Skated
Just For Fun.

Maybe He Could Save
It For School.

How Much Money Does A
Sponsored Skater Make?

A Couple Hundred A Week.

More If The Team Wins.

A Couple Hundred Bucks
A Week. I Like.

That's A Lot Of Money.

No.

But, Dad, I'm Thinking That,
Like, The Car Need Fixing.

No.

Isn't This The Kid Who Was
Just Suspended From School

For...Geez, What Was It?

Skating.

Thank You, Sweetheart.

Skating.

Yeah. What Do We Need Him To
Be On A Sponsored Team For?

So He Can Spend All Of His
Time Thinking About Skating,

Instead Of Just Most Of It?

Look, Buddy, You
Want To Get A Job,

I Think That's Great.

But Not Skating.

Dad, It's $200 A Week.

Not Skating!

So, Jordy Hits The Rail,

Pulls It Halfway,

And Then Lands It Right
On His Crotch!

<I> The Poor Dude Got Worked.</I>

<I> I Thought Gabriella Was
Gonna Need Oxygen</I>

<I> She Was Laughing So Hard.</I>

I Thought He Should
Put Some Ice On It,

But He Just Kept Saying,
"No Ice! No Ice!"

[ Knocking ]
I Gotta Use The Phone.

<I> You Can Use It When I'm Done.</I>

You Know, We Did Ok
After You Took Off,

But It Just Wasn't
The Same Without You.

C'mon, Man. You
Don't Mean That.

Excuse Me. You're The
Captain Of Our Team,
Remember?

<I> We Can't Have Our Captain
Missing Any More Sessions.</I>

Hey, Peter, There's Something I
Gotta Tell You Right Now, Man.

<I> Now, Peter!</I>

I'm Getting Off.

Brink, Man, I'm Sorry.

<I> Stepdad-Of-The-Year Is About</I>

To Go Postal On Me If I Don't
Let Him Use The Phone.

I'll See You At School Tomorrow.

Wait, Wait. Pete. Pete.

You Need More
Baking Powder.

What?

The Recipe Has A Large "T"
Next To The Number.

That Means Tablespoon.

A Small "T" Means Teaspoon.

Why Are You Even Watching Me?

Hey, You Ok, Man?

It's Only A Cake.

Yeah, Yeah.

Did You Guys Ever Notice
That Baking A Cake

Is A Lot Like Friendship?

Excuse Me?

I Mean...

You Put A Lot Of Work
Into It, Right?

And Sometimes It Doesn't Turn
Out The Way You Expected It To,

But It Still Tastes Good.

I Told You Not To Eat That
Spoonful Of Frosting.

Yeah. Sugar Can Mess You Up.

It's True. I Have
This Cousin,

And She's Not Allowed
To Eat Any Sugar.

But One Day She Had
Like Four Jellybeans

And Started Bouncing Off
The Walls Like A Pinball.

Shut Up, Jordy.

Please.

Look, Guys, There's Something
I'm Trying To Tell You.

There You Go With That
"Guy" Stuff Again.

Gabriella, Chill
Out For A Second.

I've Got To Talk To You Guys
About The Invitational.

Oh, Yeah. We're Gonna
Have A Good Time, Huh?

Hey, Betty Crockers.

Oh, Love The Aprons.

So, How's The
Training Going?

I Mean, The Invitational's
Right Around The Corner.

The Last Two Years, The Team
That Won The Invitational

Did Go On To Win The
Championship.

Now, What Team Was That?

Hmmm...

That's Right. Team X-Bladz.

Val, Could You Be
Any More Of A Jerk?

No. I Don't Think So.

Is That What You Think?

Do You Think I'm A Jerk?

Uuh...

Come On, Val. We're
Working Here, Man.

Hey, I Asked You Something.

Do You Think I'm A Jerk?

No.

Excuse Me?

No. I Don't Think
You're A Jerk.

Oh, Thank You.

See You This
Afternoon, Brink.

Yo, Buddy. What Happened?

Yeah, You Just Let Val
Slime All Over You.

He's Not Worth It.

What Did He Mean He'd
See You This Afternoon?

Uh...Who Knows?

Hey, Man, Good Job.

Thanks, Man.

That Was Rad,
Brink.

What Was That?

Excuse Me?

I Just Wanted To
Know What That Was.

Because If You Call
That Going Big,

I'm Gonna Quit Skating.

Well, We're All Gonna
Miss You, Buddy.

Ha Ha. Gotcha.

Hit It Again.

You're Kidding Me, Right?

Hit It Again.

Come On, Val.
He's Doing Ok.

Who's Running The
Show Here?

Who?

You.

That's Right.

Do It Or Vacate.

Good Doggy.

Maybe Something
Happened To Him.

Like What?

And Please Don't Start With
That Alien Stuff Again.

Yo. Whattup?

Where Ya
Been, Man?

We've Been Waiting
For Two Hours.

I've Got To Be
Home By 5:30.

Jerry's Having His Boss
Over For Dinner,

And I Gotta Pretend
I Worship The Ground
He Walks On.

Well, Then, What
Are We All Doing

Standing Around Talking?

Hey, Did You Guys Hear?

Val Found Someone To
Replace Boomer.

Yeah, I Heard That Too.

Yeah. I Head It Too.

I Heard The Guy
Was A Big Guy.

Like Korean, I Think.

No, No. Wait. He Was
Native American.

Yeah. That Was It.

I Heard He's Really Good.

I Don't Care
How Good He Is,

He Isn't Better
Than My Man Here.

That Just Means We've
Got To Hit Twice As Hard.

Let's Do It.

Yeah. Let's Do It.

S'up, Dad?

I'm Just Trying To
Fix The Beast Here

Without Any Real Knowledge
Of Automotive Mechanics.

What's The Matter With You?

Nothing, Really.

I'm Just A Little Tired.

Too Much Skating?

Skating? Too Much? Me?

Ha. No Way.

Well, You Won't Have To
Worry About That Anymore.

I Got You A Job.

A Job?

My Friend Benny-- He's Got
The Dog Grooming Place.

He's Looking For
Someone To Help Out

A Couple Of
Afternoons A Week.

That's Great, Dad,

But I Don't Know A
Thing About Animals.

You Baby-Sit Your Sister
Katie, Don't You?

Can't Be A Lot
Different Than That.

Come On. What's Wrong?

I Thought You Wanted To
Help Out Around Here.

I Do. I Just Don't Have
Time For A Job Right Now.

Why?

And Please Don't
Tell Me Skating.

Because You Know What My
Response Is Going To Be.

When Do I Start?

Brink?

Hey, Man.

I Came As Soon As I Could.

How're You Feeling?

Not So Good.

[ Coughing ]

You Look Terrible.

You're Soaked With Sweat.

I Know, Man.

I Can't Make It To The
Invitational Today.

I'm Sorry.

Hey, No Big.

Just Feel Better, Ok?

Yeah.

Would You Do Me A Huge
Favor And Get Me A
Tissue Over There?

Sure.

Here You Go.

Thanks, Man.

Will You Tell The
Others For Me?

Sure.

Hey, We'll Go Check
It Out Anyway.

No!

I Mean, No, Man. Don't.

You Know, The Invitational's
Only A Warm-Up For The
Championship.

You Guys Should Session Instead.

Ok. You're The Boss.

Take It Easy.

All Right, Man.

I Told Him To Be
Here An Hour Ago.

He'll Be Here.

Since When Did You Start
Sticking Up For Him?

Hey.

What Do You Think You're Doing?

Hey, Guys.

So What's With The Shades?

It's A Look. There's
Nothing Wrong With A
Look.

Yo, X-Bladz. You're Up.

Well, That Look Of Yours

Better Come With Some
Skating Attached.

This Is Nuts!

We Should At Least Check
Out The Invitational,

See Who Our Competition Is.

Yeah. Maybe Get A
Glimpse Of The
X-Bladz Mystery Man.

Come On, Guys.

Brink Said We
Should Session.

And We Will...

After.

Come On. We Should At Least
Catch The Last Round.

Are You Coming?

<I> Next Up, Mickey Grimes.</I>

Great Job!

Look At That! We Need
At Least A 96 To Win.

I've Been Carrying Your
Sorry Butts All Day,

And I'm Just About Ready
To Drop All Three Of You.

And, You. I Thought You Were
Supposed To Be Something.

"As Big As You Want."

Well, I Want Real Big.

And I Want It Right
Now. You Got That?

I Got It.

<I> Next Up, Andy "Brink" Brinker.</I>

3...

2...

1...

Go.

That Must Be The New Kid.

He Doesn't Look Korean.

That's Because He's Not.

Whoooo!

How Was That?

I'll Tell You In
A Few Seconds.

<I> 97. Team X-Bladz.</I>

My Man, Val!

Hey! All Right!

And, You, My Man.

I Knew You Would Be Good

But I Did Not Know
You Would Be Great.

Thanks, Jimmy.

You Guys Killed!

You're Gonna Be Unstoppable
At The Championship.

Look. I Got A Little
Something, Huh?

It's A Bonus
For Winning.

$200.

Not Bad For A
Day's Work, Huh?

I Knew It!

All Those Excuses! All
That Sneaking Away!

You Ditched Us So You Could
Join These Sell-Outs.

Gabriella, I Can
Explain Everything.

You Can Explain How
You Lied To Us?

How You Bailed On Us So You
Could Join Team X-Bladz?

Do You Have Any Idea
How Many Times I
Stuck Up For You?

Peter...

And Your Stupid Fever?

Come On.

Come On, Wait.

All Right, Play Time's Over.

I Say We Get
Together Tonight

And Go Over Some Drills
For The Championship.

Well, Looks Like We Just
Lost Our Fourth Man.

I Don't Think So, Jimmy.

Ok, It's Like This.

We Need Four People To Compete
In The Championship, Right?

We'll Get Benjy.

No. Not Benjy.

His Style Is So Sketchy.

She's Right. He's
Like Two Steps Above
A Poser.

I Know. But We Just Get
Him To Sign Up With Us,

Then We Keep Rotating
Ourselves In Instead Of Him.

But What About The Downhill?

Which One Of Us
Could Handle That?

All Right. We'll Go Check
Out The Downhill Course.

And See Who Can Do It.

How About Me?

Ok If I Sit Down?

Sure. It's Ok.

Wait. Wait.

You Guys, Come On. I
Quit Val's Team.

I Quit!

You Want To Know The
Difference Between
Them And Me?

You Bailed On Them
And You Bailed On Me.

The Difference Is, I'm Willing
To Be Your Friend Again.

Boomer's Not Going To Be
Ready For The Championship.

Them? They're Going
Nowhere Fast.

But Us,

We've Got A
Championship To Win.

All Right. Welcome Back.

It's Just Not
Normal, That's All.

He's Tired And
He's A Teenager.

Nobody's That
Unhappy All The
Time.

I Mean, It's
Been Two Weeks.

Didn't You Used To Complain
Because He Was Too Happy?

Yeah.

I Guess I Just Hoped He'd
Settle Somewhere In The
Middle.

It's So Depressing
To Talk To Him.

And What About His Friends?

They're Still Mad At
Him Over Something.

He Won't Say What.

Why Don't You
Talk To Him?

Me?

Yeah.

Talk To Brink?

You Mean With Words?

Yeah.

You Know How Hard It Is

For Me To Have A
Conversation With Him?

I Know. Such A Moody
Little Sack Of Hormones.

Katie.

Katie.

Fine.

Honey, Talk To Him.

He Needs You.

Go On.

Go.

Yo, Dad.

Yo.

Can I Talk To You
For A Second?

Yeah.

So...

I Haven't Seen Peter
Or Jordy For Awhile.

Why's That?

Just A Thing.

A Thing. All Right.

Answers That Question.

Everything Ok With Them?

Yeah, Dad.
It's Fine.

Is That "Fine" As In "Good,"

Or "Fine" As In
"Leave Me Alone"?

I Don't Know, Dad.

I Just Don't Feel Like
Talking About It, Ok?

Ok.

It's None Of My Business.

Except, Andy, You're My Son.

Taking Care Of You
Is My Business.

You Can Tell Me Or Don't
Tell Me. It's Ok.

But That Doesn't Change
My Job Description.

If You Change Your Mind,

I'm Here, Buddy.

The Championship Has
Three Parts--

Street, Vert, And Downhill.

This Is Gonna Be The
Downhill Course.

The Two Teams With The Highest
Scores On Street And Vert

Send One Person Right Here.

Yo! Earth To Brink!

Pay Attention. What
Are You Looking At?

Well, I Was Just Thinking
How Fun It Might Be

To Do A Launch Off One Of
Those Driveways Right There,

Go Up And Over The Roof
Of The Next House,

And Land Right Back
On The Road Below.

Fun?

Yeah. Fun.

Well, If You Don't Mind
Coming Back From Fantasy
Land For A Minute...

This Is About Winning.

Not Fun.

Oh, This Is Just Great.

I Guess They'll Let
Anybody Skate Here.

What Are You Guys,
Following Us?

We Came To Use The
Downhill Course.

Well, When We're Done
With It, It's All Yours.

When's That
Gonna Be?

After The Championship.

Come On Now, Run Along.

This Is A Free
Country.

We Can Be Here
If We Want.

If You Don't Like It Here,

Why Don't You Go
Back To Mexico?

<I>I'm From Peru, Estupido.</I>

I'll Make You A Deal.

How About We Race To See
Who Stays And Who Goes?

One Of You Against One Of Us.

Come On, Man. Just
Let 'Em Have It.

Why Don't You Just
Stay Out Of This?

Yeah. We Can Handle
Ourselves.

Well, Let's See. Who's
Skating For Your Crew?

Me.

Cool.

You Ready?

What?

You Against
Gabriella.

Whoever Loses
Has To Take Off.

And You Better
Not Lose, Man.

Come On, Man. You
Can't Make Me Do That.

Come On, Man.

What, Are You Afraid?

I'm Not Skating
Against You.

Why Not? You've Been
Doing It For Weeks.

Cool. We'll Go Down
To The Beach.

First One There Wins.

I'll Skate Down To
The Finish Line

To Make Sure There's
No Cheating.

There's A Big Turn
Just Before Ketner.

Stay On The Outside.

What? Wait. Wait.

You Never Stay On The
Outside Of A Turn.

Just Do It.

Gabriella, Please
Don't Do This.

When You Woke Up This Morning,

Did You Say To Yourself,

"Today, I'm Gonna Talk,"

Or "Today, I'm Gonna Skate"?

Ok. On Your
Marks!

Get Set.

And, Don't Hold Back.

Go!

Did You See That!

Gabriella, Move To The Outside!

Yeah, Right.

Aaah!

Oooh!

Oh, Man!

Gabriella!

Gabriella!

Gabby...

What Happened?

Val?

I Don't Know.

Gabriella?

She's Hurt, Man.

Oh, No.

How's She Doing?

Not Dead.

It's All My Fault.

You Got That Right.

Come On, Jordy.

Hello, Brink.

Hi, Mrs. Dellama.

How's She Doing?

Thank God, Gabriella's
Doing Fine.

Nothing's Broken.

The Doctor Says She Needs
To Stay In Bed For Awhile.

I'm Glad She's Ok.

Maybe You Should Come In

And Say Hello To Her.

It's Ok. Come On.

Gabby?

I'm Really Sorry.

I Honestly Didn't Think
Anyone Would Get Hurt.

Then I Guess For Once You
Didn't Think Of Everything.

But, Gab, You Gotta
Understand--

You Were The One Who Told
Me About Soul Skating.

About Skating From The Heart,

And Only Skating
For The Love Of It.

And I Believed You Because
You Were My Friend.

But It Was Only Gonna
Be For A Little While.

My Family Really
Needed The Money.

We All Need The Money, Brink.

What's That Have To
Do With It?

That's How It
Starts, You Know?

First You Do Something
That You Really Love,

And Then You Start Doing
It For The Money.

And Before You Know It,

You're Just Another Sell-Out.

Yo.

Hey, Dad.

What Are You Doing?

Just Looking At
My Old Skates.

Why Did You And Mom
Save All These?

I Don't Know.

Maybe We Were Planning
On Having Another Kid.

Or Maybe Just Because We're
A Couple Of Pack Rats

That Never Throw
Away Anything.

I Remember When I
Got You These.

You Were Four, Maybe
Five, Years Old.

I Figured, Hell,
I Liked Skating,

Maybe He Will Too.

Of Course I Didn't Know It Was
Going To Take Over Your Life.

Me Neither.

How's Gabriella?

Mom Called
Jordy's Mother.

You Were Racing?

I Didn't Listen To You, Dad.

I Tried Out For The
Sponsored Team.

But I Told You No.

We Needed The Money.

Not So Bad, Buddy, That We
Needed You To Disobey Us.

I Know.

I Guess It Wasn't Just
For The Money Either.

I Wanted To Be A
Part Of Team X-Bladz.

I Wanted To Have My
Picture In Every Magazine.

I Wanted To Be Somebody.

I Don't Know If You Get That.

You Know, You And Me,

We're A Lot Alike.

I Used To Love Being
Construction Foreman.

"Hi. How Ya Doin'?

I'm Ralph Brinker.
I'm The Construction
Foreman."

I Used To Love
Saying That.

People Looked Up To Me.

Then I Got Injured.

Suddenly, No More
Construction Foreman.

You Want To Know The
Worst Part Of Being
On Disability?

I Didn't Know Who
I Was Anymore.

I Used To Define Myself

By My Job Title.

But, You Want To
Know Something?

After Being Laid Off
For Six Months,

I Finally Figured Out...

That "Construction Foreman"
Is What I Do,

Not Who I Am.

Andy, You Are Defined By
The Company You Keep

And How Well
You Keep It.

Not By What You
Just Happen To Do.

Kids Who Skate-- Come
On, California's Filthy
With 'Em.

But You... You Are Andy Brinker.

You Are A Good Son.

And You Are A Good Friend.

Who Just Happens To Skate.

And Tomorrow, If You
Never Skate Again,

You're Still Andy Brinker.

I Understand There's Gonna Be A
Big Tournament This Weekend.

Yeah.

The A.A.I.L.S. Championship.

Biggest National
Tournament There Is.

You Gonna Compete?

No. I Don't Think So.

Well, If You Change Your
Mind, Let Me Know.

I'd Like To Watch.

Really?

Yeah. Sounds Like
A Lot Of Fun.

Come On. Let's Split
For The Pad.

Come On, Dad. You
And I Both Know

That No One Talks
Like That Anymore.

Did We Just Come Dangerously
Close To Having A Conversation?

Ha Ha. Yeah.
Don't Tell Mom.

No Sense Getting
Her Hopes Up.

It's About Time, Man.

Don't Give Me Strawberry.

Do I Look Like I'm
Wearing A Dress?

I Get Chocolate.

There's Your Skates!

I'm Through. I Quit.

Here's Your Helmet.

I'd Give You Back Your
Clothes Too,

But I Accidentally Threw
'Em In A Garbage Bin I
Saw Across The Street.

This Is About Your Little
Friend, Isn't It?

You Put The Gravel
On The Road.

You Realize You
Coulda Killed Her?

Man, You Are Such A Wuss.

I'm The One Who Should
Be Mad At You.

You Didn't Even Have The
Brains To Finish The Race.

Maybe Not,

But I Do Have The Brains
To Finish This.

You Are So Dead!

Hey, Hey, Hey! Not Today!

Boomer, I Didn't Think
You'd Turn On Me.

That's Your Problem, Man.
You Don't Think.

No, That's Not It.

You Know What Your
Problem Is?

You're Just No Fun
To Skate With.

You Got Beef With Me,

You Take It Up With Me
Sunday At The Championship.

Oh, We'll Get
It On For Sure.

You Need More Air.

More Air?

More Air.

And, You, Peter, What's
Up With That 540?

I've Got A Grandmother
Back In Lima.

She Can Do A 540.

What's With
You Today?

Yeah. If You Got Beef,

Why Don't You
Try It Yourself?

Fine.

Hey, Cut It Out.

You Know You're Not Supposed To
Skate Until The Weekend.

Peter, This Is Nuts.

Gabriella Can't Practice.
We Only Have Three People.

What's The Point Of
Even Competing?

Because It's Fun.

Now Let's Quit
Complaining, And Skate.

Aaaah! Oooh!

Peter!

Oh, This Is Just Great!

I Can't Fix This.

This Is Fine. Now We Don't Even
Have The Right Gear To Compete.

This Is A Joke.

Do You Guys Ever
Think Of Getting
A Sponsor?

Sponsors Are No Fun.

Well, Depends On
The Sponsor.

Thanks, But We
Already Have Shirts.

How About Skates?

I Think I Got The Sizes Right.

This Are New.

You Convinced The Dog
Groomer To Sponsor Us?

Well, Actually, I'm
Kinda The Sponsor.

Kinda?

Well, I Kinda Got My
Pay In Advance

So I Could Get You
Guys Some Stuff.

How Far In Advance?

About Four Months.

Well, Good Luck
On Sunday, Ok?

Well, Hold On A Sec.

Did You Really Throw That
Vanilla Shake In Val's Face?

Chocolate.

How Did It Feel?

It Was Cool And It Was
So Suh-Weet!

So...Uh...

Well, You See, What
Peter's Trying To
Say Is That...

Well...

What Are You Doing On Sunday?

<I> [ Announcer ]
It's Zuma Beach, California,</I>

<I> Site Of The Third
Annual Aggressive</I>

<I> Inline Skating Championship.</I>

<I> What We've Got Here Are The
Nation's Top Ten Teams</I>

<I> Going Head To Head In
Three Events--</I>

<I> Street, Vert, And Downhill.</I>

Hey, Check It
Out. Espn.

Oh, Man, This Is
The Big Time.

We've Got Every Magazine
Covering This.

We've Got Scouts From All The
Biggest Companies Watching.

Hey, That Doesn't
Matter. Right, Guys?

We're In This
For The Fun.

We're Soul Skaters.

Soul Skaters.

Yeah, Brothers.

Oh, My Gosh!

It's Team Pup 'N Suds!

I Heard About You Guys.

You Guys Get
Paid In Kibble &
Bits, Right?

Now I Want You Guys To
Practice Saying This.

Really, We Tried, But
We're Just Too Lame.

At Least We Had
A Good Time.

I Think They Like Us.

Let's Get Out Of Here.

<I> Announcer:
In The Championship Format,
Each Skater's Run</I>

<I> From Street/Vert Counts
Toward The Team Total.</I>

<I> The Two Top-Scoring Teams
Will Select A Skater</I>

<I> For A Head-To-Head Race
In The Downhill.</I>

<I> Let's Get Right To The
Street Competition.</I>

All Right, Gabriella,

Show 'Em What Soul
Skating's All About!

She Hasn't Trained In Four
Days. She's Got Nothing.

<I> Our First Skater Up, A
Virtual Unknown</I>

<I> Gabriella Dellama From
Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

<I> Wow. Coming In A Nice Crab.</I>

<I> One Of The Few Girls Out Here,</I>

<I> Skating All The Way
Across The Course.</I>

<I> We Don't Know A Whole
Lot About This Team</I>

<I> But Beautiful Top Soul.</I>

<I> Nice Style On The Mini Ramp.</I>

Yeah, Gabriella! Come On!

<I> And A Great Run So Far</I>

<I> From An Unknown Skater.</I>

<I> Nice Style There. The
Liu Kang Grab Transfer.</I>

<I> And A 540 Upping
The Difficulty.</I>

<I>She Has Time For One More Trick
With Less Than Five Seconds.</I>

<I> A Huge 540 Liu Kang Grab.</I>

<I> Excellent Style!
Solid First Run!</I>

Yeah!

<I> A 93. Next Up, Val Horrigan.</I>

<I> Here Stands The Nation's
Top-Ranked Skater</I>

<I> On The Top-Ranked Team.</I>

<I> Prepare To Be Dazzled.</I>

<I> Val Horrigan Going Off.</I>

<I> He Does More Big Tricks</I>

<I> Than Anyone Else In The
Same Amount Of Time.</I>

<I> Such A Beautiful Mixture Of
Airs, Grinds, And Spins.</I>

<I> Nice Consistency.</I>

<I> An Incredible Run.</I>

<I> Probably The Top
One So Far Today.</I>

<I> A 98! Exactly
What He Deserves.</I>

<I> Next Up, Andy Brinker,
Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

<I> We've Seen Him Skate Before.</I>

<I> He's Not That Well Known,</I>

<I> But He Always Seems To Do
Well In The Competition.</I>

<I> Brink's The Guy Who's
Gonna Definitely Try</I>

<I> To Use The Course A
Little Bit Differently</I>

<I> Than Any Of The Other Skaters.</I>

<I> He's A Very Creative Skater.</I>

<I>Now Coming Up To The Boardwalk.</I>

<I> This Is What I Was
Talking About, Going
Into The Mini Ramp.</I>

<I> Huge Transfer Backing
It Up With A Huge Gap</I>

<I> All The Way To The Bank.</I>

<I> Brink Skating With
Tons Of Speed,</I>

<I> Setting Up For A Soul Grind--</I>

<I> Aah.</I>

Yeah. Go Soul Skaters.

<I> With Falls Like That,</I>

<I> It Is Gonna Be Difficult To
Compete With The Other Skaters</I>

<I> Having Such Flawless
Runs Here Today.</I>

<I> Brink Losing His Rhythm.</I>

<I> He's Got To Put Something
Together Here To Stay
Competitive.</I>

<I> A Nice Royale All The
Way Down The Rail.</I>

<I> And Another Royale
Into The Mini Ramp.</I>

<I> Brink, Able To Come
Back In The Groove,</I>

<I>Finishing With A Nice Mid Vert.</I>

Wooooo!

<I>He Looks Slightly Disappointed.</I>

<I> A Score Of 89 For Brink.</I>

Mom! Katie!

Yeah.

Are You Ok? That
Was A Great Run.

Yeah, But I Got
Worked On That Fall.

But It's Ok. We'll
Make It Up.

Where's Dad?

Oh, He'll Be Here.

He Got Called Down To
The Construction Site.

Mr. Beckman Wants To Talk
To Him About Something.

Is That Good?

Well, We'll Find
Out, Huh?

Hey, Can I Give
You Some Advice?

Skate Better.

Skate Better...

Skate Better!

Mom, Skate Better!

Well, There You Are.

All I Have To Do
Is Skate Better.

Come On. Let's Go Watch
Him Skate Better.

Come On! Woooo!

<I> And A Huge Stylish Flyfish.</I>

<I> With Runs Like This,</I>

<I> Team Pup 'N Suds Is Definitely
The Surprise Here Today.</I>

<I> A Score Of 97 Puts
'Em In Fourth Place.</I>

Fourth Place?

That's All Right,

And Besides, We Got
The Vert Coming Up.

You Know We Rule
On The Vert.

And, Pete, Man, I'm
Gonna Need An Awesome
540 Out Of You, Ok?

You Got It, Bud.

You Can Do It!

<I> The Vert Event Is Next.</I>

<I> Team X-Bladz Has The
Commanding Lead.</I>

<I> But There Are Many Teams
Battling For Second</I>

<I> And A Spot In The
Grueling Downhill.</I>

Hey.

Hey. Well?

Oh, No, Ralph...

They're Gonna Let You Go?

I Start Again On Monday.

Oh, My Gosh!

I'm So Happy!

Ow!

Don't Scare Me Like That.

Ok. There He Is.

Go, Brink!

<I> Team Pup 'N Suds, You're Up.</I>

<I> Skating First Is Andy
"Brink" Brinker.</I>

Yeah Brink!

<I>He Has Some Making Up To Do For
That Fall In The Street Run</I>

<I> But Starts It Off With
A Nice, Solid Invert.</I>

<I> Brink's Starting To Get
High In The Air.</I>

<I> A Huge Safety Grab 540</I>

<I> Well Over Head High.</I>

<I> Back-To-Back 540S Right
Into Another 540 Unnatural.</I>

<I> Spinning His
Opposite Direction,</I>

<I> Now Working The Coping.</I>

<I> With A Run Like This,
Team Pup 'N Suds</I>

<I> Could Be Today's Wild Card.</I>

<I> A Huge 900 Two And A
Half Full Spins!</I>

<I> An Awesome Run From
Andy Brinker</I>

<I> And Today's Longshot
Team, Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

<I> Their Chance To Make It To The
Downhill Slight But Possible.</I>

<I> And With A Score Of A
98, It Could Happen.</I>

That's My Boy!

He Was All Over That Ramp!

<I> Up Next, Val Horrigan,
Team X-Bladz.</I>

All Right!

<I> Team X-Bladz Is Running Away
With Yet Another Competition.</I>

<I> Val Horrigan Is Very
Comfortable Being In
First Place.</I>

<I> And In Typical
Form, The Huge Air.</I>

<I> Mixing It Up, Getting
Very Acrobatic.</I>

<I> Val Is One Of Those Skaters So
Comfortable With The Spins.</I>

<I> Great Orientation
On The Half Pipe.</I>

<I> Some Difficult Tricks
But No Coping Tricks.</I>

<I> And It's That Lack
Of Lip Tricks</I>

<I> That Might Have Cost
Him A Couple Of Points.</I>

<I> He Ends With Still A
High Score. A 97.</I>

<I> Another Great Run For
Team Pup 'N Suds,</I>

<I> But It's Not Gonna Be Enough.</I>

<I> If Ben Kelly From Team G-Force</I>

<I> Can Even Pull Off A
Reasonable One,</I>

<I> It's Gonna Be G-Force Vs
X-Bladz In The Downhill.</I>

Kelly's Been Nailing
It All Day.

Well, It Ain't Over Till
It's Over. Right, Man?

Well, That's It For Us.

<I> And A Great Carving 540.</I>

<I> Over Rotates And
Goes Down Hard.</I>

<I>All The Way To The Flat Bottom.</I>

<I> And He's Completely Off
The Ramp, Not Moving,</I>

<I> Being Attended Right
Now By The Medics.</I>

<I> He Rises To His Feet. He's Ok.</I>

<I> Getting The Support
Of The Crowd.</I>

<I> An Unfortunate Circumstance
For Team G-Force.</I>

<I> However, An Opportunity
For Team Pup 'N Suds</I>

<I> With One Skater To Go.</I>

Dad, We Can Win.

We Can Win Now?

We Can Win.

All Right, Peter, Man,

Not To Put Any
Pressure On You--

I Know. I Know.

Come On, Peter.

<I> Next Up, Peter Calhoun.</I>

<I> Peter Calhoun Is Going To Need
The Run Of All Runs</I>

<I>If He's Gonna Bring Team Pup 'N
Suds To The Downhill Race.</I>

<I> Starting Off With
Huge Amplitude.</I>

<I> Everything He Does, He's Gonna
Try To Do Well Overhead.</I>

<I> Back-To-Back Airs,</I>

<I> Good Definition On The Grabs,</I>

<I> And A Huge 920 But
Lands Awfully Low.</I>

<I> With That Low Landing
He's Gonna Have To Pull
Something Incredible.</I>

Here Comes Our 540.

<I> There It Is! The
Incredible Trick--</I>

<I> An Inverted 540 Which
Lands Up High On The Vert.</I>

<I> One And A Half Full Body
Rotations, Completely
Upside Down.</I>

<I> Beautiful Style.</I>

<I> Peter Calhoun Mixing It Up
With Spins, Huge Airs--</I>

<I>He Could Very Well Be Bringing
Team Pup 'N Suds To The Finals.</I>

<I> 98! They Have Done It!</I>

<I> What A Great Way To End
The Vert Championships!</I>

<I> Downhill, Last Run.</I>

<I> It's Gonna Be One Skater From
Pup 'N Suds Vs One Skater</I>

<I> From X-Bladz On A
Treacherous Downhill Race.</I>

<I> Winner Takes All.</I>

Welcome To The Friendship
Bell Downhill.

This Is The Most Dangerous
Course In Competition Today,

Ok, Guys, We Did It.

We Came This Far And I'm Not
Gonna Let You Guys Down.

Do You Hear Me?

Just Remember One Thing--

Win Or Lose, Skating
Is What We Do,

Not Who We Are.

Man, That Was Like Deep.

Pup 'N Suds, You Guys
Have One Minute.

Ok, Dude.
This Is It.

Good Luck.

We'll See You At The Bottom.

All Right, Man.

You Know, Before I Just
Wanted To Beat You.

Now I'm Gonna Humiliate You.

You Ever Hear That
Winning Isn't
Everything?

Oh, Sure.

Didn't Believe It Then,

And I Don't Believe It Now.

And Neither Do You.

Yeah, I Wanna Win.

But No Matter What, Win Or Lose,

At The End Of The Day
I'm Not You.

So It's Still A Good Day.

<I> Skaters, To Your Marks.</I>

<I> Get Set.</I>

Come On, Buddy!
You Can Do It!

<I> Both Skaters Just Flying Down
The Course, Neck And Neck,</I>

<I> This Is The Section In The
Course Where The Top Speeds
Will Be Reached.</I>

<I> Both Totally In A Tuck.</I>

<I> Whoever Can Be The
Most Aerodynamic</I>

<I> Is Gonna Start To Pull Away.</I>

<I> 42.5 Miles Per Hours!</I>

<I> That Is A New Course Record.</I>

Yeaaa!

Go, My Man Val!

Jordy, Man, My
Arm's Going Numb.

Where Did He Go?

There's A Blind
Turn. We'll See 'Em
In A Minute.

Is That All You Got?

Oooh!

Dude, Are You Ok?

Come On. Let's Get
You Out Of Here.

You Never Did Have The
Brains To Finish A Race

When Someone Was Down.

I Guess Not.

That's What I Was
Counting On.

Get It?

You Bet. I Got It All.

<I> As Expected, Val
Horrigan In The Lead.</I>

<I> A Huge Air Out Of The Alley,</I>

<I> Coming Out Of Nowhere,
And They're Back.</I>

My Move! My Move!

<I> Back To The Neck-And-Neck
Position They've Had
Throughout The Race,</I>

<I> It's Into The Tucks.</I>

<I> This Is It-- A Dead Sprint.</I>

<I> This Is All Heart.</I>

<I>Both Skaters Totally Exhausted.</I>

<I> Oh, Yes!</I>

<I> They've Done It!</I>

<I> Team Pup 'N Suds From Behind
Grabs The Championship!</I>

<I> An Incredible Finish!</I>

Katie!

How Does It Feel?

It Feels Great, Dad!

Hey, I Didn't Know Val Would
Do Something Like That, Man.

I'm Sorry.

Yeah, Man. Me Too.

It's Ok. You Guys
Didn't Know.

Hey, We Need
To Talk.

Listen. Val's Out.

Cheating's A Bad Thing.

You, You're In.

You're My Man.

You Want Me To Be The
Captain Of Team X-Bladz?

You Got It. Money,
Sponsorships.

You Know How The
Drill Works.

Come On.
Whatta Ya Say?

I Was On Team X-Bladz Once.

It Wasn't Any Fun.

I'm Sorry, Man. I'll
See You Around.

Soul Skaters!

There's Nothing We Can't Do!
