(anxious violin, piano music)

(classic rock tones)

Come with me.

Just for a minute.

â™ª Nobody knows the trouble I've seen â™ª

â™ª I had to do what ever they did â™ª

â™ª Somebody please try to hold me down â™ª

You've always loved it here.

It's our special place.

(classic rock music)

â™ª Hold my hand the
sweetie if you have to â™ª

Remember that night out here?

Our first date.

â™ª Too many times I heard you laughing â™ª

â™ª Look me in the eye and
say it didn't happen â™ª

â™ª Too many times with our love dyin' â™ª

â™ª Even when I didn't,
I didn't mind trying â™ª

â™ª Nobody knows the trouble I've seen â™ª

Stacy, please.

You don't know how hard I've been trying.

â™ª Trying to hold me
down, somebody please â™ª

It doesn't have to end like this.

Bobby, I don't want you
to be mad or anything.

I want us both to be happy.

Well then say it.

Promise you'll stay with me.

I promise I'll never forget
what we had, that's it.

Take me home now.

No, let me hold you.

Just a hug,

one last kiss.

No, Bobby, no!
You promised

we'd be together forever.

Bobby, stop!
We'd be together forever.

Stop!
Forever.

No!

(Stacy screams)

Please stop it!

No.

Bobby, stop!

Stop!

Bobby, stop!

Oh, no!

(Stacy screaming)

(classic rock music)

Bobby, what happened man?

â™ª Nobody knows the trouble I've seen â™ª

â™ª I had to do whatever they did â™ª

What'd you do, man?

â™ª Somebody please tell me â™ª

What the hell did you do?

(crowd cheering)

Yeah boy over and under, use it, use it!

No!

Get away from him!

(whistle blares)

He had such a cute butt too.

He was cute but not strong.

[Cheerleaders] THS,

we are the best!

(cheerleaders chanting)

If you guys are finished,
we're on number seven.

When you try to get romantic
with your man, he A,

turns on the TV,

B, says okay but just
for a few minutes or C--

Or C, covers me with
chocolate then licks me clean.

C, definitely C.

I'll take it myself.

The quiz is called Have
You Found the Perfect Guy?

So if you've never even like

talked to a guy, don't you score zero?

Heated Desire.

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

(crowd cheering)

Hello, did somebody
just say the perfect guy?

(whistle blares)

[Coach] Let's go, Bobby, grab
his head, get his head down!

Come on!

Get on him there, you.

All right!

It looks like drool to me.
Valerie, stop.

Come on, you've been obsessing

over him for like two years.

I have not and besides,
I hate wrestling.

Then why are we here?

We're missing Ricki Lake.

Today show, girls who
deny they're in love.

Oh, will you guys quit it?

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

Anyway, he has a girlfriend.

That girl with the hair
right, like a satellite dish?

She moved away.

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

Yeah!
Yeah!

(whistle blares)

(crowd cheers)

Let's go, Bobby.
Nice body!

[Nicki] He did smile at you, I saw him.

Yeah 'cause I was staring
like an idiot, thank you.

Stac, as your best friend
in the entire world

I gotta break it to you, you
are really dense about guys.

But why would he like me?

I mean he's so popular, he's a senior.

You know what, if you worried about your

love life as much as you
worried about your mother's--

Okay, what do you think?

My unicorn earrings?

Yeah, I think they're cute.

Rod says he's gonna take me dancing.

They look very nice, Ms. Collins.

Oh mom, you still have your name tag on.

I've been rushing all day.

Nicki, are you gonna stay for supper?

No, I think we're
gonna go get some pizza.

(telephone ringing)

Who's Rod?
This new guy she's dating.

I don't know though,

even if Bobby's there,
what am I gonna say?

Just loosen up, have
fun and be yourself.

[Laura] No really, it's okay.

Yeah okay, call me later.

He canceled again?
It's not his fault.

Mom.

Well they're cutting
hours down at the garage.

I'm gonna stay home.
No you're not.

Come on, I need a good
night's sleep anyway.

Are you sure you'll be okay?

Yeah, I'll be okay.

Goodnight, Ms. Collins.
Goodnight.

I'll be home early.
Okay dear.

Okay, let's go.
So we go.

â™ª She doesn't know the reason â™ª

But I don't understand why

she lets him treat her like that.

Just like that last jerk Eddie.

Well I guess if she's cool with it--

Yeah but if that's what she wanted,

she should've just stayed married.

â™ª Just from you to me â™ª

Didn't I tell you?

â™ª I get so nervous that I tell myself â™ª

So Bobby, we're kinda counting on you.

You were serious right, I
could borrow your truck?

You pick her up in
that, you're on your way.

Oh yeah, well until
she sees who's driving.

Just keep the seats clean, okay?

And don't scratch the paint.

So are you bringing her flowers?

You think I should?
No man, flowers are corny.

[Friend] You're wrong, girls like that.

What would you do?

Here I'll show you, excuse me, yo.

I was just wondering, do
you like getting flowers?

From you?

Ouch.
No, I'm serious.

Do girls like it when
guys bring them flowers?

I do.

I mean I guess I would.

I do too.

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

What, do these girls go
to your school or something?

I don't know, you seen 'em before?

Yeah, they were at the
match, the "Nice body."

Wait, that was her?
Are you ready for next week?

Yeah, yeah, I'll make weight

in a couple of days, how about you?

Almost.
You gonna make weight?

I don't think so.

What are they doing now?

Oddly I think they're
getting ready to leave.

Just tell me when they leave.

Whoa, hello.

What?
He's coming over.

Who?

Bobby.

Nicki, don't kid around like that.

[Nicki] Just don't panic, talk to him.

I saw you the other day.

Me?

Yeah, in the gym.

You were in the stands like

cheering.

She's

a really huge fan of wrestling,

she loves it.

Oh yeah?

No.

I mean that wasn't me up in the stands.

Yo Bobby, let's go man.

So why don't you come by
the gym Monday after practice?

Oh well, I'm busy but Stac can go.

Okay, great.

Oh.

This is for you.

It's kinda bent.

See you Monday.

Oh god, he's so cute.

My god.

(school bell rings)

I want to see men out
there, aggressive, dominating.

Remember it's not about
strength, it's about control

and how do you get control?

You demoralize your opponent,

catch him off guard, let
him know who's in charge.

That's what makes a
champion, you understand?

[Wrestlers] Yes.

All right, then let's hit the shower.

[Wrestler] Hey Tim, wait for me.

(relaxed piano tones)

Hey.
Am I too early or should I--

No you're fine, I always
lift after practice.

You can spot me?
Spot you?

Yeah, yeah come on, I'll show you.

Keep your hands on the bar for balance

in case I lose my grip.
But isn't it heavy?

Not yet.

You know about what
happened at the gym on Friday.

It was pretty cool.
I didn't--

It was?

Most girls, they look at ya

but don't say what they're thinking.

They don't?

No, so when somebody's honest

about the way they feel, that's good.

You all set?
Yeah.

Okay.

Put your hands on the bar.

All right.

One.

He asked you out to the lake?

Well it's not like a date date.

It's more like a group thing.
Right.

Bobby Tennison does not invite

a girl to the lake for any group thing.

You're wrong, he is really
smart and he's so sweet.

You'll see, I told him
you guys would come too.

Oh Stacy come on,

he doesn't want us there, it'll be weird.

Yeah.
Okay.

I promised I wouldn't tell
this so don't say anything

but Bobby said that Tony asked about you.

Tony, you mean the--
oh god, not cute butt?

Yep, he's gonna be there too.

Ma!

Ma, dad, I gotta talk to you.

â™ª Love â™ª

It's hopeless.

Honey, you look beautiful.

We're gonna miss our reservation.

I'm all set Rod, I'll be right out.

You mean you're wearing that?

Should I change?

Mom, why do you let him do that?

Honey, he didn't mean anything by it.

Don't make excuses,
the guy is treating you

crummy and you're acting
like it's your fault.

Honey, be nice.

Now you're gonna have a
wonderful time tonight.

Yeah but don't you deserve to be happy?

If you're happy, I'm happy too.

How about putting a big smile on that face

before that perfect man of
yours sees you all upset?

Mom this is Bobby, Bobby, my mom.

[Bobby] Hi, nice to
meet you Ms. Collins.

It should be real nice
out by the lake tonight.

Hi, Rod Merredi.
Bobby.

I recall a few of those beach

parties myself back in my younger days.

Shouldn't we be going?
Yeah, is 11 okay?

Yeah that'd be fine,
you guys have a good time.

Yeah.

(upbeat rock music)

â™ª The time is right for
taking it all the way â™ª

â™ª We may now find out if
it's a serious thing â™ª

I'm telling you, it's a total nose job.

No way is all that hair real.

I don't know, she seems kinda helpful.

Please look, she's like all over him.

Guys, Kelly's not that bad.

Actually I mean she's a lot of fun.

But with my cousin, it's like

the harder she tries, the less he notices.

Wait, Bobby's your cousin?

Yeah, that's mostly why we hang out.

Besides, the rest of
our family's so screwy.

So Donna, you like know
all his little secrets right?

No, no, look Stacy, don't
tell him I said that all right?

Okay.

Not quite.

[Woman] It's totally cool.

Sweet.

â™ª And your hand in mine â™ª

You have to reach out.

Like that.
Look at that.

I'll be right back.

Hey Stac, why don't we take a walk?

Yeah.

Great.

â™ª Making love â™ª

So you like it here?
Yeah, it's beautiful.

Yeah it's great, we
come here all the time.

Yeah?

Yeah, it's a great
place to just hang out.

I miss him though.

We used to do stuff together
before things got bad.

But I'm closer to my mom now.

Tonight though I just
couldn't talk to her at all.

Don't you wish that like

you had one person that
just understood everything

and just really listened to you?

Gosh, I'm talking to much.

Well what about your parents?

My father is gone too.

You mean--
It doesn't matter.

I take care of myself, I just know that

I'm not gonna be like either one of them.

Yeah, I'm not gonna
be like my mom either.

When I find somebody, it's gonna be right.

Someone that cares about you.

Who's there for you no matter what you do.

Yeah, exactly.

That's what I want too.

(relaxed ensemble music)

(up tempo electronic music)

(school bell rings)

â™ª Light from a star â™ª

â™ª One kiss and you stole my heart â™ª

â™ª I've got a love â™ª

So you have to find
the points on the graph

of y equals negative x
cubed plus six x squared.

The line is horizontal, you try one.

Hey Stacy.
Hey.

We missed you at the
Student Council meeting.

Oh, I was helping a friend study.

Isn't the same without you.
We're kinda busy here.

Yeah, okay.

I'll see you later.
Okay.

You're terrible.

I'm gonna go get my books.

[Valerie] So why are
you hiding back here?

We're not, Bobby just wanted--

I'll be right back.

Hey, what's wrong?
You said we'd be alone.

Yeah but those are my--
No but,

but you said we'd be alone.

Yeah but they're not gonna--
Will you listen?

What are you doing?

Don't worry about us,
we'll amuse ourselves.

I'm sorry.

I just,

I only want to be with you.

Stacy, tell me you're okay.

Just promise me you're all right.

(ominous violin tone)

(upbeat drumbeat)

â™ª Howling at the moon â™ª

â™ª Sun's gone down not a moment too soon â™ª

(shouting, screaming)

Let's go Bobby, come on.

Keep going, get them Bobby.

â™ª Drop dead if you like to make us shout â™ª

â™ª Don't need to tell what we're about â™ª

â™ª I see you howling at the moon â™ª

â™ª Howling to the moon and just open wide â™ª

â™ª Don't you wanna know
what's on the other side â™ª

Hey, you spying on me?
Maybe.

You got something to hide?
Maybe.

What are you hiding?

A unicorn, I can't believe you remembered.

Who are these pictures of?

[Stacy] My friends.

Who is he?
That's Brian.

What are you doing with him?

Nothing, I told you he's my friend.

Then why is his arm around you?

[Stacy] Bobby.

All right, so where's my picture huh?

Well maybe I haven't got your picture.

Well you're gonna have to get one.

I know.
Okay.

(upbeat electronic music)

Hey Stacy, do you have any of that,

ooh, what do we have here?

Nicki, Nicki, don't read it.

He writes poetry.
Nicki, give it back.

Stacy, a real love poem?

Stacy, you got that boy whipped.

So like what's it like?
Come on, read it to us.

No.

Oh come on, just a couple lines.

[Valerie] Stacy you
have to, it's the law.

No, it's just all that
regular stuff, you know how--

â™ª Forever â™ª

Hey, give it back.
Bobby wait.

Bobby wait.

[Tony] Give me a kiss.

Not until you write me a poem.

Bobby, I didn't read it to
'em, we were just having fun.

Oh, you like making fun of me?

No, that's not what I meant.

Hey, what's between
us is nobody's business.

I wouldn't tell them anything important.

Well if it's not important to you then--

No, Bobby, don't do that, Bobby--

Why'd you have to get me so mad?

Just go.

No.

Stacy, come on.

I hate to see you cry like that.

So I got a little jealous.

Can I help it

if I'm in love with you?

I love you too.

(relaxed violin, piano music)

What are they doing now?

Looks like they can't keep
their hands off each other.

(crowd cheering)

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

Go Bobby, yeah!

Let's go, Bobby.

Let's go, beat him.

Let's go, pin him down.

Come on Bobby, get him.

Pin him down.

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

(whistle blares)

(crowd cheers)

Woo!

Woo!

Woo!

I'll get clothes for
the night, wait here.

But Bobby, if I cut your hair now,

then you could just get dressed.

Bobby.

It's been two months and I
haven't even met your mom yet.

And I told you, she sleeps a lot.

[Mom] Bobby, Bobby.

[Bobby] What?

[Mom] I really need your
help in the yard today.

[Bobby] What do you need my help for?

You're here all day.
Come on, I really need--

[Bobby] No, all you do is sit and watch

television ma, can't
you go and do something?

I want you to help me--
I've got plans, I gotta go.

But if there's no reason
I shouldn't meet her--

The reason is I don't want
you to, now can we drop it?

Hey, can I be next?

I've been begging her
for weeks to do my hair.

But your hair looks so good like that.

You think so?
Yeah.

I have to do the color.
Mom.

What?

Oh.

I'll go change.

So,

any other rules I should know about?

Well, I think you should be
home at night when I call you.

What, are you serious?

Yeah.

You weren't home last
night, I was worried.

Yeah but I was studying
with Nicki and some friends.

[Bobby] What if I wanted to see you?

Yeah but Bobby, you never said that--

You shouldn't be going out with big

groups of people when
I'm not around anyway.

Come on, why not?

What if some guy hits on you?

How do you think that'll make me feel?

I know but I always
hang out with my friends.

I thought we loved each other.

We do.

But--

Stacy come here, come here.

You're my girlfriend now,
I don't wanna lose you.

I want you all to myself.

You want all of me?

I want your lips

and your neck.

I want your body.

Bobby, my mom's here.

Your soft, sexy legs.

(relaxed piano, violin music)

You mean like this color?

Yeah, something like that.

I don't know, we could try something.

A little sassier.

Sassy.

â™ª I don't need the roses every morning â™ª

â™ª We don't have to go out everywhere â™ª

Oh gosh, I look so fat.

You do not, I always said you
should wear stuff like that.

Yeah?

Definitely but try this on with it.

So are you gonna come to

the movies with Tony and me on Friday?

Well Bobby's busy.

Then just the three of us.

I don't know, I have to
study, did you ask Val?

Yeah, she's got some family thing.

Ow, what happened to your back?

Oh.

Nothing.
It looks painful.

How did it happen?

Out at the lake I guess.

Oh really and what exactly
were you doing on your back?

No.

No, and you didn't tell me?

I know, I was going to I just--

Are you like okay, were you scared?

No, I don't know.

Nicki, he's so different,
it was so special.

The way he held me for the longest time.

â™ª That's how much you're in love with me â™ª

And then he made me
promise him something.

What, made you promise what?

He made me promise that
we'd be together forever.

â™ª Simple girl â™ª

â™ª I don't care for fancy cars â™ª

[Tony] What evil mind
invented first period practice?

[Neil] Tony man, you wearing perfume?

It's called cologne, wet sock.

Nicki gave it to me.
Ooh, Nicki.

If she gave you a dress,
would you wear that too?

Nah.

It might get Neil too excited.

Speaking of dresses, Tennison.

I'd be pumping too if I had a
girlfriend dressed like yours.

What?

What did you say?

I saw your girlfriend this
morning, she's looking fine.

(anxious violin, piano tones)

What the hell's wrong with you?

What, what did I do?

Look at you, showing
your ass to everybody.

Here, for when the other
guys walk around you.

Is that how much you care about me?

Bobby no, I wore this for you.

For me, you look like a slut.

But you said you loved my legs.

Do you just like
embarrassing me like this?

No, Bobby nobody thinks that--

You just care about what I think.

It's just me because nobody
else cares about you.

Nobody else wants you.

But I don't want anybody else.

(anxious violin, piano tones)

Hey Stac, where you going?

Class is over here.

Bobby, Bobby please don't be mad.

I didn't mean to hurt you.

You want everybody to
hear you, to see you cry?

You want to embarrass me again?

No, I didn't want to do anything.

Bobby, I wore this for
you because I love you.

Don't turn around and leave--
Will you stop?

What are you trying--

Great.

You happy now?

You all right?

Back to the match guys, come on let's go.

What am I seeing here?
It's nothing, coach.

It's an accident.

I slipped.

But you're okay now, right?

What's going on, Bobby?

Now you're my best wrestler, if I have to

report this and we lose
you for the County Finals--

No coach, she just slipped
and fell, that's all, nothing.

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

Okay.

Okay then but from now on,

you save that spirit for the team.

(whistle blares)

I love you.

(ominous violin tones)

I rented that movie you wanted to see

but you've been in here for hours.

Oh yeah, I've been talking to Bobby.

Getting pretty serious, huh?

Yeah, he's funny and smart
and he makes me feel protected,

like he'll always be there for me.

But still, you see
him every day at school

and then you spend every
night talking to him--

He's my boyfriend, we love each other.

I know and I know he's popular

and fun and he's interested--
Then what's the problem?

You have other friends
and you have plans

and to let him control your whole life--

Mom wait, that is your story, not mine.

What we have together is something real.

I'm only saying--

What you're saying is
that because I met someone

great who loves me and just
because of what happened--

I want to be your friend.

Then why make such a big deal?

Because you've always been strong

and independent and I
want you to stay that way.

Well don't worry, I'm not you.

I can take care of myself.

(telephone ringing)

â™ª Many loves â™ª

Hello?

A surprise for me too?

Bobby, hold on.

â™ª Along the way â™ª

No, nothing.

Well tell me what my surprise is.

Come on, just a hint.

Come on it'll be fun, you
remember last year's dance.

I can't, Bobby wants to talk.

All right, then just
come when you're done.

I don't know.

[Nicki] Come on Stac,
we need you, your ideas.

I want to, it's just that Bobby

thinks this whole thing
is just, I gotta go.

I gotta go

â™ª For a simple girl â™ª

Stacy's not coming, is she?

She seems so tired lately.
Of her friends, you mean.

It's like she has Bobby now so
she doesn't need us anymore.

I heard they had this big fight

last night outside of
Romeo's and broke up.

Again?

Besides but it's like she hangs on him,

pushing his buttons like some
kind of fatal attraction.

It's like she's not even
the same person, you know?

Does she talk about Bobby?
Just you know,

everything's fine and
they're so much in love.

But you see how he treats her.

How he pushes her around.

Don't tell him I said this, all right?

Do you know that girl, you know Tracy,

you know with the big hair?

Yeah yeah of course,
she moved away right?

She transferred out.

I only saw this once, Tony was there too.

Bobby, he just like slapped her right in

the face and then he acts
like it's just no big deal.

[Woman] Come on over.

â™ª Just wrap your arms around me â™ª

â™ª Because baby I'm a lonely girl â™ª

â™ª Some people â™ª

â™ª They just want to fight â™ª

â™ª He asked the question, what's
so special about the sky â™ª

â™ª It's a simple love for a simple girl â™ª

Stac, you gotta see the
gym, it looks so awesome.

Yeah, Bobby said we
might go to the dance.

I thought you guys had a fight?

Oh no, I was just being stupid.

Look what he got me.

It's real gold.
It's really pretty.

It's his birthday next week
and he gets me a present.

Is that sweet or what?

You never tell me
what's going on anymore.

Everything's fine.

Because I heard this
thing that happened once.

I guess I don't know, Bobby
hit one of his girlfriends--

What are you, rumor central?
Stacy, come on.

I know you, I know when
something's wrong and

I just, I see how he gets.
Yeah.

So he gets a little jealous, okay?

Guys are like that.

So you mean like he never--

You know what, will you stop?

You say you know me, right?

Well did you know that not once in

my life have I ever felt special at all?

But to Bobby, I'm the most
important thing in the world

and I'm not gonna give that up

just because he gets a little jealous.

Stac.

I just,

I worry is all and--
Well don't.

Because I can take care of myself.

(relaxed ensemble music)

Surprise.

Oh.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Tennison.

Yes?

Hi, I'm Stacy Collins, Bobby's friend.

Oh of course, he talks
about you all the time.

Come on.

I'd ask why you don't stop by?

I'd like to.

I can see how happy you've made Bobby.

Things haven't been easy for
him since his father left.

I'm sure he's told you all about that.

No.

Actually not really, you mean
he was close to his father?

Bobby's always missed
him but of course he

wouldn't come right out and
say it but sometimes when he--

Get out of the truck.

[Stacy] Oh Bobby, it's
okay, I was shopping here--

Get out of the truck.
Bobby.

Come on.
Will you stop?

I didn't do anything.

Bobby you're hurting me, Bobby.

I said stay away from her, didn't I?

But your mom--

It doesn't matter what she thinks.

It's me you're supposed to care about.

Bobby I do, I love you.

No, you say you love me and
then you go behind my back.

No.

Bobby, why is it that every time

I say or do something, it's wrong?

Bobby, will you wait?

You never just talk to me anymore.

Get out of the way.
This is crazy.

We never just talk anymore,
Bobby don't, Bobby.

Bobby, will you listen to me
please, will you talk to me?

(tires screeching)

Fine then just stay away
from me okay, just stay away!

(anxious violin, piano tones)

Stacy, is that you?
Uh-huh.

I just got home from
work, Rod's on his way over.

There's some sandwich stuff in the fridge.

(soft piano, violin tones)

We have a reservation at five.

Here, let me, go eat your sandwich.

Remember when I used to make it

for you in the big yellow mug?

You said that's how it tasted best.

Whatever happened to those years?

Then before you know it, it
all changes and you and I,

Stacy what happened?

Bobby and I were goofing around.

That's a big bruise for goofing around.

You know I had that meeting Monday

with Mrs. Cole about your grades

and I told her that we talked

and that you hadn't mentioned
that there were any problems.

(car horn honking)

That's Rod.

I better go.

You want to talk about problems?

Let's start with yours,
let's talk about Rod.

Stacy please--

And the crappy way he treats you

but of course you never see a thing.

I swear I don't know
what's with you anymore.

You're either out with Bobby
or moping in your room--

But you let him control your whole life.

At least I have someone who loves me.

You said you'd be outside.

Stacy please, we've always been friends.

Maybe I don't want you to be my friend.

Maybe I want you to be my mother.

She's 16.

Okay?

Come on, we're gonna be late.

Laura, let's go.

[Stacy] Oh my god.

What are you doing in
here, how'd you get here?

I had to see you.

Stacy, I swear--
No, I want you out now.

I don't blame you for hating me.

But if we're going to break
up I just, let me explain.

What do you mean, explain what?

About my family.

I didn't want you to know.

See,

my dad's a drunk, all right?

And he'd come home

yelling.

Almost every night, he'd
find something wrong,

some dirty dish or some stupid thing

my mother would say and he'd beat her.

I'd lie down and I'd listen to her cry.

There was nothing I could do,

but she'd never leave the bastard.

Then she started drinking and then

everything got so out of control.

Why didn't you tell me?
Because that's not us.

Don't you see?

We're different, what we have
is so much better than that.

When I think about losing you...

If only my family weren't so screwed up.

Yeah, mine too.

It's like my mom is
jealous of what we have.

She doesn't understand anything.

No one can.

That's why we gotta stick together because

when you love somebody,

you never give up on 'em.

Don't worry about me, I'm not giving up.

[Bobby] I love you so much.

(up tempo ensemble music)

â™ª Another blast from the past â™ª

(rhythmic humming)

â™ª Little bitty pretty one â™ª

â™ª Come on and talk to me â™ª

â™ª Lovely, girly lovely one â™ª

â™ª Come sit down on my knee â™ª

Oh, hi Stacy.
Hi Mrs. Cole.

Glad you're here, look,

did your mother tell you
that we spoke last week?

Yeah, bye Mrs. Cole.

I was hoping that maybe
we could get together.

â™ª Whoa oh oh â™ª

Hey you guys.

â™ª Little bitty pretty one â™ª

â™ª I've been watching you grow â™ª

Hey, okay.
Stacy.

[Stacy] Hey, what's up?

It's a gift for you guys,
another flask, you like that?

â™ª Another 50s hit â™ª

Bobby, come dance with me please.

No, no.
Come on.

All right guys, all right, ready?

(up tempo ensemble music)

â™ª That you would find â™ª

(rhythmic clapping, cheering)

â™ª Oh sweet thing, keep coming my way â™ª

â™ª We're travelers in the Milky Way â™ª

[Friend] Go, Bobby.


â™ª My love for you â™ª

â™ª Will last â™ª

â™ª 'Til time itself â™ª

â™ª Is through â™ª

â™ª Oh my darling â™ª

We see the same team the next weekend.

Tony start getting honest
with this guy, right?

Across the barn, hey it
wasn't my deal right?

So I go out there,

I took my time and I
hit him over and over.

It's so cool.
It's so much fun.

Okay, we're outta here.

Bobby why?

We're having such a good time.

â™ª My darling â™ª

â™ª Oh my darling â™ª

â™ª This I swear â™ª

â™ª Is true â™ª

â™ª Swear is true â™ª


You don't respect that guy.
He's only my friend.

I don't care what--
He's my friend, don't.

[Stacy] I wasn't.

[Bobby] You want to go out
with that guy instead of me?

Bobby please--
How stupid can you be?

Get away from her.
Bobby, what's going on?

Look, it was an accident okay?

I was--
Stacy, he hit you.

[Stacy] He didn't hurt me.

[Nicki] Your nose is
bleeding, let's go inside.

This is between us, okay?

You are not going with him, you hear me?

He treats you like crap.

Well you don't know
what he's been through.

Besides, you don't give
up on someone you love.

You call that love?

I don't even think he likes you.

Well then you don't know what love is.

(tires screeching)

(somber violin, flute music)

(distant shouting)

[Laura] Just grow up Rod.

[Rod] I'm fed up with
this, I've had it with you.

Then just go.
You push me,

you push me, you push me!
Well you're free to go, Rod.

Tell Stacy to come say
hello after she's done.

We've got some catching up to do.

I think she's pretty tired, mom.

Is everything all right?

A fight with her boyfriend I guess.

Oh.

I remember some of those,

all that life and death stuff right?

(relaxed ensemble music)

You gotta tell your
mom, we'll do it together.

Maybe if I just--
No, you can't.

He said he was sorry, he wants to change.

But he won't and you know that.

Yeah but if I could just--
Stacy, would you stop it?

You keep acting like this is your fault.

Can't you see that it's his?

You know what's the hardest thing of all?

When you've been friends
with somebody for so long

and you think that it'll
be that way forever.

Things were so good.
(telephone rings)

Hello.

How did,

no she can't.

Because she's sleeping.

No, you cannot come over.

I gotta go.

It's like he always knows where I am,

who I'm with, what I'm doing.

God, if I could just get away.

Stac, listen to me,
everything's gonna be okay.

You'll talk to him this week,
you'll tell him it's over.

Kim, she has this birthday
party on Saturday night.

Bobby won't be there, we'll celebrate.

You, me and Val just like the old times.

This is my fault too,
I pushed you into this.

But Saturday it'll be all over.

(telephone rings)

What?

Oh, hi Ms. Collins.

Yeah hold on, she's right here.

Hi mom.

Honey, I know it's late but I just

had to tell you tonight about me and Rod.

I finally took your advice.

You mean you ended it?

Yeah.

I was really scared.

But you should've seen the expression

on his face when I really
stood up for myself.

That's great mom, I can't,

I'm really proud of you.

I should've taken your
advice a long time ago.

I really love you, honey.
I love you.

Okay bye.

She dumped him?

Saturday night, okay?

[Bobby] Come on Stacy,
I said I was sorry.

I know and I know that you care about me

but it's not just what
happened at the dance.

Look, we'll take a drive
and talk it over, I promise--

Bobby I mean it, we have
to stop seeing each other.

Wait a minute--
Look.

I need to be alone, okay?

My life is so messed up, I
don't talk to any of my friends.

I'm behind in all my classes,
I just want my life back.

But you're my life.

Look,

I still want to be friends.

I could never give you up.

(anxious violin, rock tones)

â™ª When I look at you,
I look into your eyes â™ª

Great party, gonna be a party right?

Come on.

Come on Stacy, six
more pins and we got 'em.

Okay, I'll try.

Yes!

Yeah.

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Don't worry Stac, I got it.

She really looks awful.

She's probably crushed that
Bobby's not here tonight.

Tony said they broke up.

Oh yeah, like we believe that.

It was a good try.

I shouldn't be here.

Yes you should.

I just keep seeing his face everywhere

and he looked so sad.
We are not

discussing that tonight.
I know, I know.

It's just that everything's
so tied into Bobby.

How can I just--
Nicki, you're next.

It's just,

it's the first week.

I know, I just wish I could
go away somewhere you know?

It's so hard.

You know what Stac, it's
a party and I think if

you're gonna talk about Bobby,
I think you should leave.

This party blows but I've got my car.

Do you want me to come over?

We can watch that show you like.

Carla, wait.

Is Stacy there?

Yeah, who's she with?

A guy?

Maybe, I don't know.

Hey, do you wanna try out that new place?

Come on Carla, let me talk to Stacy.

Yeah okay, hold on.

Hey Stacy, it's for you.

It's for me?
Yeah.

Hello?

Hey Stac.

Bobby.

No I quit, yeah I turned in my shoes.

I miss you.

It feels strange not being together.

Stacy, I know it was my fault.

I just, I hope you meant it
that we can still be friends.

Yeah, I want to.

I want to be friends.

(ominous violin tones)

Are you still there?

Yeah.

I was just thinking about
that haircut you promised.

Because if you're done there
and you want to come over--

Come over to your house?
Yeah.

You know, take the tour.

I'm just here with Vince
and he's working today.

I'm trying to be friends.

Yeah okay, I'll wait outside.

Yeah, well you better be nice

or else you're gonna get a crew cut.

Yeah.

Okay, bye.

(anxious piano, violin tones)

[Employee] For our main entrants,

the following scores are now up.


Hi.

You look great, get in.

â™ª Brother go on and find him â™ª

â™ª Before you get too far, don't you ever â™ª

Bobby, I've got my car, can I come too?

Yeah, sure.

â™ª Don't you ever â™ª

[Bobby] One weekend and you're

already out with some other guy.

[Stacy] Bobby, I was with friends

and we're not even together--

[Bobby] I knew that's
why you wanted to break up.

[Stacy] Why are you doing this to me?

[Bobby] No, it's what you're doing.

Fooling around just to embarrass me.

[Stacy] What I do is none
of your business anymore.

Ow!

Stacy, Stacy, come on.

I'm sorry.

â™ª Don't you ever â™ª

Come finish my hair.

â™ª Before you send back
home for your soul â™ª

Vince, go find her will ya?

â™ª Don't you ever weep for your soul â™ª

It's late.

I better go too.

Hey Carla,

if anybody asks,

it was just me and Stacy
here tonight, okay?

We had a fight and she ran out.

That's all they need to know, okay?

Yeah okay.

(ominous violin tones)

Hey come on, everything's cool.

Now let's just go back inside.

He doesn't mean anything by it.

Stacy.

This is for you.

Come on, I'll take you home.

Bobby, I just want to go home.

â™ª A little secret saved just for you â™ª

â™ª Too many times I can hear you laughing â™ª

â™ª Look me in the eye and
say it didn't happen â™ª

Come with me.

â™ª Too many times I felt like dying â™ª

Just for a minute.

â™ª Nobody knows the trouble I've seen â™ª

â™ª I had to do whatever they did â™ª

â™ª Somebody please try to hold me down â™ª

You've always loved it
here, it's our special place.

â™ª Out â™ª

â™ª Out â™ª

â™ª Hold my head in near if you have to â™ª

Remember that night out here?

Our first date.

â™ª Too many times I heard you laughing â™ª

â™ª Look me in the eye and
say it didn't happen â™ª

â™ª Too many times I've felt like dying â™ª

â™ª Even when I didn't, I
never stopped trying â™ª

(telephone ringing)

Hello?

[Laura] Nicki it's Ms.
Collins, can I speak to Stacy?

No why, isn't she there?

You mean she didn't
stay over last night?

Wait a second, you mean she
never came home last night?

No

and Bobby just called and said that

they argued last night and she walked off.

Okay don't worry, I'll
find her, I'll go right now.

I mean

where would she go?

Where's Stacy?
She's not here.

I looked everywhere.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry about everything.

[Nicki] What happened last night?

She,

she came over and gave me a haircut, then

we had a fight, she started crying

about going away

and

being alone and then she took off.

We've gotta find her.

We'll find her, she's probably

just at like the mall or
maybe a restaurant downtown.

We should check with her mom, though.

It's my fault, I just
wanted to talk to her.

I'm so sorry.

Well when she comes back,

you oughta remember that.

(anxious violin tones)

Then I searched those
shelters out by the golf course.

Wait,

she mentioned some family
with a beach house.

Yeah the DeAngelos, I called.

I called everyone.

The police told me to wait for 24 hours.

What about family out of town?

Maybe she took a bus.
No.

I don't know, she's never done
anything like this before.

I just hope she doesn't catch a ride.

(anxious ensemble music)

I'll get everyone to help,
we'll have her home tonight.

[Anderson] Does she drink, do drugs?

Ever talk of suicide?
No, not Stacy, never.

You said she's been angry.

Well not angry, I mean we get along.

[Anderson] Any arguments lately?

Little ones, you know.

I guess after 10 hours of
work, you don't always--

Then she'd run off?
No.

She's never done anything
like this before.

Did you talk to her before the party?

I called yesterday
morning, she wasn't there.

She's been staying with
her girlfriend Nicki.

What about the boyfriend,
this Bobby Tennison?

What about him?
I don't know.

They have a good
relationship, are they happy?

They're always together.

Lots of emotions, fights?

No.

They get along.

She's a good kid.

It's just that I don't know
where she is, that's all.

(school bell rings)

Bobby called the whole team
and he told me he went out

to the golf course last night
and searched with flashlights.

I bet she's staying
in a motel somewhere.

So you think she ran away?

What is that supposed to mean?

I mean we know she ran away.

[Friend] Bobby said she seemed pretty

stressed out but he thinks
she'll be back soon.

Hey Ton, crazy night huh?

Hey Nick, there's a cop downstairs

talking to Bobby and Carla.

(anxious violin, flute music)

[Reporter] The
investigation into the weekend

disappearance of a local
high school girl intensifies.

16 year old Stacy Collins may have left

the area after a dispute with a classmate

but sources now say they're looking into

a similar incident last June when a girl

seen hitchhiking on route 97
was later found with her--

(somber violin, piano music)

(doorbell buzzes)
(light knocking)

Mrs. Tennison?
Yes.

I'm Laura Collins, Stacy's mom.

Did she come back?
No, she didn't.

I need to talk to Bobby.

He's down the hall to the left.

Thank you.

Three days without even a
call, does that make sense?

We just gotta hope we hear something.

[Laura] You were the
last one to see her.

Don't lie to me, something
must have happened.

I told you the truth.

To run off like that alone in the dark

and you didn't try to stop her?

I thought she'd call you or Nicki.

There must be something
you're not telling me.

â™ª You're gonna do it
anyways but I've got news â™ª

â™ª I've got news for you â™ª

[Laura] What's this doing here?

â™ª If you think you're gonna walk away â™ª

She must've left it.
Stacy left her purse?

Look I told you she
was upset, she forgot it.

Did you tell the police?

I was out searching, I didn't see it.

â™ª Told you I've got news â™ª

â™ª I've got news for you â™ª

She's my daughter, you hear me?

If you're lying to me...

I told you.

I love her.

If you know where she is,

if you have anything to do
with this, anything at all,

I swear to God.

â™ª I'll show you just how hard it can be â™ª

â™ª You think I'm just gonna let you go â™ª

â™ª Baby, baby, I told
you love I've got news â™ª

â™ª I've got news â™ª

I won't do this
anymore, guys he hit her.

We all saw that

and we all know that he
could've done something worse.

She's right, when I
saw him at the police

station yesterday, he
had this look in his eye.

I swear we're

closer than brothers

and it's like I don't know him anymore.

It's like that night at the dance,

he hit her in front of everybody.

He didn't even care if people saw.

All week he's totally calm.

He's not even worried that Stacy's gone.

It's 'cause he thinks he
can get away with anything.

Is everybody done?

Because I've got something to say.

Bobby's always been there for
you, always stood up for you.

Now you can't wait to turn against him.

Well I'm not gonna listen.

Carla, what happened that night?

Did you see them fight?

It was none of my business.

Well did you see her run out,

did you even try to stop her?

Carla, what happened to Stacy?

They argued and she ran
out and that's all I know.

Well I think you're lying.

Then you can go to hell.

You were nobody until
Bobby made you his friend.

You know what, this is not
some stupid test about loyalty!

If Stacy is hurt,

you owe her that much.

I told you what I know

and from now on, you can
just stay away from me.

(somber violin music)

We'll just tell 'em what we know, right?

Whatever happened to Stacy,
that's all we can do.

(dramatic mid tempo drumbeat)

Get over, yeah!

Yeah.

(crowd cheering)

[Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

(whistle blares)

(classic rock tones)

(electronic beeping)

So what's he like?

I know you're hanging out together.

Is he just a tough guy,
is he a big drinker?

Does he act wild?

(telephone rings)

Yeah?

[Woman] A man on the line with

some information on the
missing Collins girl.

Yeah okay, put him through.
Yes sir.

Yeah, yeah this is Anderson,
you got some information?

[Vince] Yeah.

Just

go look out by the lake.

Okay and a number
where you can be reached?

[Vince] Just go look
out by the lake, okay?

Yeah I will but just in
case I need to get in touch.

(anxious violin, rock tones)

[Officer] What about
that hill over there?

[Officer] Park back
on the green line there.

Gentlemen, why don't you roam around

in that scrub and see
what you can come up with?

Officers, there's a cove on
the other side of the beach.

Why don't you make your way
there, see what you can see?

(anxious ensemble music)


Nicki.

There's something I need to tell you.

I can understand if
your daughter's afraid.

But as long as she's cooperates with

us now, you have nothing to worry about.

Ms. Collins.

Do you know a boy named Vince Fortner?

[Nicki] Yeah Bobby's friend, why?

Well apparently he was
with Bobby on Saturday night.

When Stacy ran out, Vince went after her.

We're looking for him now,
why don't you come in?

If only she hadn't come back.

I told her to break it off, to stay away.

But she wouldn't listen.

She defended him.

Once she told me that if she
just learned to love him better

and didn't give up, then he
would treat her better too.

I saw bruises but she
told me they were nothing.

There was like this wall

that you just could not break through and

you'd never think something
could happen, you know?

(officer knocking)

Excuse me please.

One night she came home really late.

She was freezing cold.

She looked so sad all bundled up.

I asked her what was wrong and
she said they'd had a fight.

I could've stopped it then.

Why didn't I see it then?

[Vince] All right, all right.

Hey look man, I'm
walking as fast as I can.

[Nicki] That sounds like Vince.

What did you do to her?
I didn't do anything.

Where's my daughter?
I swear to you,

I didn't do anything, what
are you talking about?

I'll tell you Vince,
it doesn't look good.

Carla said you went after Stacy

and Bobby, well Bobby
says you never came back.

What?

Now if there's something you'd

like to tell me, now is the time.

All right.

Bobby, he was wack man, like
screaming at her and stuff.

So he said he wanted
to go out to the lake.

Then he got real calm, he
said he wanted to talk.

Come with me.

â™ª Even when I didn't,
I didn't stop trying â™ª

Just for a minute.

â™ª The trouble I've seen â™ª

â™ª I had to do whatever they did â™ª

â™ª Somebody please try to hold me down â™ª

â™ª Somebody please try to take me out â™ª

â™ª Out â™ª

â™ª Hold my hand in fear â™ª

He was gone about 10 minutes.

(anxious violin tones)

Bobby, what happened man?

I did it.

What are you talking about?

If I can't have her, no one's gonna.

Bobby, that's crazy.

What did you do, man?

What the hell did you do?

I'm going to be honest with you, Bobby.

Here's what I think happened.

You had a fight.

Got carried away.
No.

No I told you, I didn't--
Just listen.

You had a fight, you're a strong guy.

Maybe you got her behind the neck,

one of those wrestling moves I bet.

Just trying to calm
her down, I understand.

Accidents happen.
I swear to you,

I love Stacy, I'd never hurt her.

Fine, fine but this was an accident.

Now here's the thing.

Tell me now and I can help you.

But when we find her body and come up with

your prints, I gotta
lock you up for murder.

So think about this, Bobby look at me.

I want you to seriously think

if there's something you need to say.

It's bothering you, see
that's what happens.

It starts to bother you.

You know where she is, help yourself.

Tell me the truth, Bobby.

I told you,

you're wrong about me and Stacy.

Come on.
You don't understand.

Bobby, it'll eat you up Bobby.

Can't you see I'm mourning too?

If you'd just listen--
No no no, you listen!

I know you had a fight,
I know you hurt her.

Do you want to go away
for the rest of your life?

Because I know you killed her.

Where is she Bobby, where'd you put her?

Where is Stacy?

Tell me where she is!

(anxious violin, light piano tones)

Think, Bobby.

Stacy please, you don't know
how hard I've been trying.

It doesn't have to end like this.

Bobby, I don't want you
to be mad or anything.

I want us both to be happy.
Well then say it.

Promise you'll stay with me.

I promise I'll never forget
what we had, that's it.

Take me home now.

No, let me hold you.

Just a hug.

Just

one last kiss.

You promised we'd be together forever.

Bobby stop.
We'd be together forever.

Stop.
Together forever.

No.

(Stacy screams)

Bobby stop it!

No, Bobby.

Stop, no.

Bobby I love you, Bobby stop!

(anxious mid tempo drumbeat)

(helicopter whirring)

I think we found something.

(truck beeping)

(police radio chattering)

[Officer] Got about 10 minutes more.

[Anderson] We'll let the
coroner make an assessment.

You get the photographer on the line?

[Female Officer] Right away.

Yeah, just tie it off.
Okay.

[Officer] You know what, hold off on it.

No, this is not Stacy.

It can't be Stacy.

Oh god, no.

Ma'am, I can't let you over there.

Oh no!

(somber violin music)

(Laura wailing)

[Prosecutor] During that
time they were together,

did you ever see Bobby hit Stacy?

[Carla] Yes.

[Prosecutor] What were the circumstances

that would lead to his hitting her?

Shall I repeat the question?
No.

Sometimes he'd hit her but
because she would aggravate him.

He'd tell her to do something
and she wouldn't do it.

Just that kinda stuff.

She'd do it to get attention,

even though he told her not to.

I remember one day her
neck was bruised really bad.

So I was like that's it,
I'm gonna talk to Bobby.

I just, I just thought that

if he hurt her, she would leave him.

I mean who's gonna stay
with a guy who hits you?

He can't force her to stay.

Right?

And besides, Bobby's gone
out with lots of girls.

Nothing ever happened to them.

There was just no way he would hurt her.

It's like you know how
guys are always talking,

what they did to a girl
or what they're gonna do?

But everybody knows that's just talking,

it's not real

and Bobby you know, he
was always our friend.

So when I saw him hit her,
there was a part of me that,

okay I should've stopped it.

But I'm just thinking this is Bobby.

"I love him."

That's all she said.

Whatever

he did, it was like

she was under his control, you know?

I begged her to let me tell but

she called it betrayal

and I did not want to lose her.

I did not want to lose Stacy.

I didn't want to lose my friend.

â™ª Who would ever guess â™ª

â™ª What lies beneath the tenderness â™ª

â™ª There's a part of you
that is hidden from view â™ª

[Bailey] Mr. Tennison, would you stand?

â™ª But no one could tell â™ª

Bobby Tennison, for
the crime of murder in

the first degree, the
court orders that you be

punished by confinement for a
term of life without parole.

Yes.
Nice.

(scattered clapping)

Before we leave, there's
something else I wanted to say.

How many of you have been hit?

Who among you slaps their girlfriend?

Well this is against the law,
this is wrong and you know

what, you watched it happen
to Stacy and you did nothing.

You have a responsibility to
the people you care about.

When you see them hurting
or you see them in trouble,

you step in and you tell someone

so that this does not happen again.

â™ª Don't tell me that I'm mistaken â™ª

â™ª The fault was truly not with me â™ª

â™ª If I find you waking â™ª

â™ª Now I can rarely see â™ª

â™ª But no one would tell â™ª

â™ª No one would tell â™ª

â™ª No one would tell â™ª

(anxious ensemble music)
