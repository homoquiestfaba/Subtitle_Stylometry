Too many of us have gotten sick.

We can patch the holes, uh...

There are over 8000 of us here.

We'll take care of them, we'll feed them.

We'll house them, and you know what?
While we're at it...

...why don't we give them some extra cash,

No one is giving us money.

We were afraid banks

You that good of a gambler?

There's no such thing as a good gambler.

Hey, I haven't risked a nickel in 25 years.

I became so good, no one could deny it.

And the kids stopped making fun of me.

I want to make a league here...

...just like we had at home.

You remember the first time
you put a ball in my hand? I was 5.

You told me about Babe Ruth
and Lou Gehrig. Lefty Grove.

You made me believe
that I could be Babe Ruth.

That that was possible,
that I could try to be like him.

But you know what, Dad?

It's not true.

Did he make the news in New York?

You know, he reminded me of Billy Jr.

I thought he really had a chance.
I taught him things I believe.

He never even got an at bat.

Can you imagine that?
You spend your whole life...

...dreaming of making it there,
then get called into the Army.

Why couldn't they at least
let him have one?

Just one stinking big-league at bat?

Wasn't any sugar left.
Must have used it all up.

Billy, take a look at this lineup now.

The great New York Yankees.
No DiMaggio, no Bill Dickey.

We're gonna have another chance.

I'm too damn old.

No, no, not with the way things are now.

The war's changing everything.

We've gotta get Don Lemon

Down at the Avenue.
What's the Avenue?

You want a drink?

Sure.

LYLE:
Oh, so Central Avenue, downtown L.A.

All the best players in the country
go there.

Oh.
And so this one night...

...uh, somehow I got up the nerve
to just go on down there for jam night.

By myself.
Oh, my gosh.

I mean, I was so nervous...

...I just stood by the edge of the stage.

Everyone was looking at me
funny because...

I mean, it's a hundred percent
colored people over there.

Oh.

So, um, they finally call my name
and I put my horn to my lips.

And nothing.
No.

I could not play a note.

But, you know, there was this piano guy.

He was this old cat.
He looked at me and he said:

"Go ahead, son. Play a verse."
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.

But I did. I did. I started playing...

...and it was amazing.

Me, up there...

...with guys from Count Basie's band.

Wow.

Okay, I never even knew
that Japs played jazz.

I'm not a Jap.

I was born here just like you.

I'm sorry, I didn't me--

Thanks for letting me play with the band.

LYLE: Hey, big brother.
Worn out from all that dancing?

Yeah. It's hot in there.

Give me a cigarette.

Didn't know you still had those moves.
Yeah, that Nancy girl's running off my feet.

What are you doing out here?

Oh, you know, just needed some air.
Yeah.

So?

I've become a goddamn babysitter.

Oh, sorry.

No English.

You, you understand English.

BILLY:
Throw it back here.

If you can't get it all the way...

...just try to get it as close to Mack,

You got a pretty good arm.

How about betting a buck and see
if you can strike out the sergeant there?

Five bucks.

Five?

I'll put up the 5.

BILLY:
One at bat. Maximum seven pitches.

Hit, walk or strike out.
You strike me out, you win 5 bucks.

You don't, I win.

Call the shot, Billy. Like Babe Ruth.
Show him where you're gonna hit it.

[BILLY GRUNTS]

Throw them in there, Lyle.

Easy money, Lyle.

We got a couple of suckers
on our hands here.

Ball one.
That was right down the middle.

Off the outside corner. One and two.

Ball two.
That was strike three and you know it.

Just a little bit high,
don't you think there, Macky?

That's right.
Just a little bit, just a little bit high.

Bullshit.
Hey, watch your mouth, boy.

Ha. Not much question about that one.

BILLY:
Full count. Three and two.

Let's see what you do
with money on the line.

Ball four.

Where's my money, hotshot?

You couldn't hit me
if your life depended on it.

You weren't even close those first two.

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

NORI:
Ten bucks.

I handle the money.

Here's your 10 bucks.
And thank you.

Thank you for a great demonstration
of skill and sportsmanship.

Let it go.

Who the hell does he think he is,

This had nothing to do with baseball.

It's okay. Just take it again at half tempo,
but this time listen.

No, no. Don't go easy on me.
I wanna play it fast, jazz-style.

See? It's not about playing it fast.

Sometimes it's more about what you're
not playing than what you are playing.

You just have to listen.
I am listening.

No, you're not listening.
You don't even know how to listen.

I listen.

Hey, I know these guys.

Old guys. They told me
they spent their whole lives...

...trying to learn
how to play one phrase.

Listening to it,

I enlisted.

I joined the Army.

I can't be in here anymore.

You should have come to me--
I feel like I'm not doing anything.

I accepted what happened to us--
You accepted it?

I accepted it
because we didn't have a choice.

But now we have a choice.

Now I can prove that I'm as American
as anybody else.

You just get smarter by the minute,
don't you, Lane?

Do you understand how much shame
you've brought our family?

Lane, that's enough.
I need to do this. I need to tell him this.

I'm the only one in here
who's not afraid to say what I think.

Lyle.

You lost a scholarship. Big deal.

Everyone in here
has lost something, Lyle.

LANE:
And no one complains.

No one says anything,
no one cries, except you.

Only you.

You know what?

You go.

Go fight.

You go over there...

...you get yourself killed.

See what that proves.

I doubt that very much, Mack.

I know they're gonna be killing Krauts
and not their own...

...but don't make no sense
letting them join our Army.

LANE:
I will wear this with pride.

And the thought of you...

...all of you,
will remind me of why I'm there.

Of what I'm fighting for.

And thanks for coming to see me off.

KATIE: Yeah, I'm just here.

I, uh, got off a little early, so if you're
done now, I can drive us.

Oh. Okay. I just have to finish cleaning up
a couple things back here.

Where are your Jap girls?

They left a little while ago.

I'll just-- I'll meet you at the truck.
I'll be there in a minute.

All right.

[KATIE & LYLE LAUGHING]

EMI:
Oh, Lyle. Lyle, come here. Come.

Did you see this in the camp paper?

The Quakers are gonna
offer a scholarship.

"One player from the camp league...

...all expenses paid,
to the University of Delaware."

LYLE: Whoever wins this
can get out of here, go to college?

EMI:
Yes.

He's here. Tell him.

Have you seen the paper this morning?

If the Quakers will offer
this scholarship...

...then I can win this
and I can get out of here.

Did you hear what I said? I can get this.
You know that.

Now...

...I asked you before, you said no to me.

Kazuo, what he's trying to say is--
Emi.

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

I just want a chance for this.

LYLE: I know that I haven't been--
No booze.

Yeah, yeah, okay.

KAZ:
No gambling.

All right.

No seeing that girl.

What?

What does she have to do
with anything?

Everyone in camp knows.

Everyone is talking.

I don't care what they say.

I say.

No <i>hakujin</i>.

Kaz, it could be a chance for him.

Quiet.

Lyle. Lyle.

EMI: If your father won't let you play
on his team...

...there are other teams to play for.

You can--
You tell my son to turn his back on me?

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

[EMI SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

No.

[CROWD CHEERING]

Next batter.

[BAMBINO PLAYING UKULELE]

All right.

Whoo! What you get? What you get?
Give me one, bro.

Strike one.
Aw.

Come on, brother.
You need some glasses.

BAMBINO:
Strike.

BAMBINO: Give me another one.
Eh, never could stand Hawaiian music.

Well, you know <i>da kine</i> jazz?

Give me one big headache, bro.

[CROWD GROANS]

MAN: Foul ball.
BAMBINO: Jeez.

It was a long strike.
You know aloha means "hello," yeah?

Ha-ha. Whoo.

BAMBINO:
What you get? What you get?

Whoa. Whoo!

Okay. All right. All right.

You know, it also means
"I love you," brother.

What you get? What you get?

[BAMBINO GRUNTS]

Hey, doesn't it also mean goodbye?

[BAMBINO CHUCKLES]

Aloha.

I had an idea
about when I win the scholarship.

How do you know you're gonna win it?

I'll win it.
Ha-ha-ha.

But when I get out of here, I was thinking
that you would come with me.

Come with you?
Yeah.

I've been thinking about it a lot.
I mean, you're a good musician, Katie.

A really good musician,
but you need to learn more.

You need to play with other people...

...you need to, you know,
get more experience.

Then maybe one day, you know...

...you could play professionally
or you could teach.

Uh, Lyle, I'm--
That school is in Delaware.

I've never been outside of Abraham
in my life.

Yeah, but that is the point, Katie.

You've got to get out of Abraham.

There's nothing there.

Delaware has this
really good music department.

And I already got you an application.

We--

I want you to come with me.

Yes.

I will.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

BILLY: Ed, guess what.
Yankees are looking for a catcher.

Dapper Don might be coming down here.

I don't give a shit about that.

What's the matter with you?

I always figured Katie and my boy Jackie
would be together someday.

And I even came to think of her
as my own daughter.

Yeah, and?

Now I don't.

You've been seeing some Jap?

What?

You've been seeing some Jap boy?

Billy, what--?
Answer the question, Katie.

No.
No?

You haven't been
seeing that Jap, Nomura?

No. No, ha-ha, of course not.

Well, what Ed heard is wrong.

BILLY:
I know you wouldn't do that.

I know you would never do
anything like that.

BILLY:
Not to me, not to our family.

Not to the memory of your brother.

I spoke to Director Watson...

...about how to ease tension
between us and the people in town.

We had an idea to have a game...

...between your baseball team
and our Topaz team.

Maybe we have--

No. Nobody on our team
would ever set foot in that camp.

JOE:
Uh, delivery's running late, uh...

They just called,
said they'll be about 15, 20 minutes.

I got a package to pick up
at the post office.

Take care of their order
when the delivery comes.

A basket for you and your wife.

JOE:
Thank you, Kaz.

This town is sick to death of you people.

Why don't you go back
where you came from?

I'm from Los Angeles.


LYLE:
No. Get off.

You hungry? Go ahead, eat.

Eat!

Hey! Hey, knock it off!

The hell are you doing out here, Nomura?

Nomura? This that kid?

[LYLE SCREAMS]

BILLY:
All right, that's enough.

Break it up. Break it up.
Come here. Break it up!

Everybody, go on. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

BILLY:
Take it home, Ed.

All right. Okay.

Are you okay?
LYLE: Yeah.

Okay?
BILLY: Get him in the jeep.

LYLE: No, I'm fine.
Okay.

SHIRLEY: Who told you that one? Oh.
Mary Beth.

[SHIRLEY CHUCKLES]

We had a little trouble in town today.
One of the prisoners tried to run off.

Run off?
Where are they gonna run to?

There's nothing around for 300 miles.
He wasn't trying to escape.

He came into town with us
to get some supplies...

...and then he decided
he'd just wander off...

...and get himself a burger.

That Nomura kid.

What did you do to him?

BILLY:
Me? Nothing.

Couple fellas in town
roughed him up a little bit.

Excuse me for just a second.
Sit your ass down.

You're not going back
to that camp, Katie.

BILLY: Not tomorrow, not the next day.
Not ever.

What?
You've been fired from your job.

BILLY: You try to go back into that camp,
the guards will stop you.

[DOOR SLAMS]

[BILLY SIGHS]

Heard you didn't get the scholarship
because of your injury.

NORI:
That's too bad.

Things happen. Whatever happens,
we have to deal with it.

Tough luck, kid.

Deal with it.

REPORTER: <i>The Japanese-American</i>
<i>442nd Regimental Combat Team...</i>

<i>...moving up from their battles in Italy</i>
<i>into the Vosges mountains in France...</i>

<i>...fighting in tough terrain</i>
<i>against seasoned German forces...</i>

<i>...trying to rescue a lost battalion</i>
<i>of fellow Americans.</i>

<i>Mission after mission, these stalwart</i>
<i>fighting men are proving themselves...</i>

<i>...bringing honor to themselves</i>
<i>and the nation...</i>

<i>...that is proud to call them citizens.</i>

Hey, Billy.

You know anybody in the Texas 36th?

No, I think Mack knows
a bunch of guys with them.

Well, the Krauts cut them off
up in the Vosges mountains in France.

They got ripped up bad.

None of our other guys
could get up the mountain to help them.

Except for them.

The 442nd, they took 800 casualties...

...to save 211 guys in the 36th.

These guys...

...they're all from Topaz.

Barber says to her, "Sweetheart,
you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie."

She says, "I know.
I'm gonna get boobies too."

[ED LAUGHS]

Just got off the bus from Phoenix.

On my way to Topaz.

[LANE SIGHS]

Thought I'd get cleaned up
before seeing my folks.

The back's kind of raggedy...

...so think it could use a trim right now.

Billy gets called up, we're gonna be
missing a pretty big bat next year.

Hmm. Not gonna be as easy...

...to win a championship again.
JOE: Mm-hm.

Still, as long as Grover's with us,
you know, we got a good arm there.

I'm kind of in a hurry here.

An MP's picking me up
in a couple minutes.

I don't cut Jap hair.

NORRIS:
Lieutenant Nomura.

Corporal Norris, here to pick you up.

At ease.

Welcome back, sir.

Thank you.

Hi, Mom.

[EMI SOBBING]

Dad.

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

KAZ:
Lane, we kept everything.

He wanted to show you
how he kept them.

And I was telling him
that he was acting like a librarian.

And the news.

[LANE CHUCKLES]

And I really think
that he can still get a new job as a librarian.

[DOOR OPENS]

Hey. I heard you were back.

Hi, Lyle.

Ahem.
Uh, how've you been?

Fine.

I went around to neighbors
and got everything you like.

EMI: When Mrs. Watanabe came
with the <i>mochi</i>...

...I thought it was perfect.
I have everything I wanted.

I thought you would've lost more weight.

You'd be like skinny, skinny, skinny.

Now you're gonna have
home cooking again.

Sounds good.

KATIE:
I can't stand it anymore.

I'm doing nothing.
I can't play music, I can't come here.

I'm just stuck in that house
here in Abraham.

I have to do something.

[KATIE SIGHS]

I'm going away.

What?

I am going away...

...on my own.

Where are you going?

I'm going to Delaware. To school.
I got accepted.

No, that wasn't the plan.
You were going there because I was.

I applied because of you, but now it--

I mean,
this is an amazing chance for me.

You're the one who told me I could do this,
I could get out of Abraham. It was you.

You were going there with me.

I can't see you here anyway.

BILLY:
Prisoner, step away from the fence.

Civilian on the outside,
get back away from the fence.

Civilian and prisoner, both of you,
step back away from the fence.

NORRIS:
Hey.

How's your brother adjusting
to being back?

Uh, he's doing okay.

He's a hell of a guy.
Yeah.

Hey, I'm not talking about
the Silver Star or any of that.

That day I picked him up,
we were driving back...

...he never said a word about
what happened in that barbershop.

What barbershop?

Didn't even faze him enough
to bother mentioning it to you, huh?

What are you talking about?

Just a haircut.

That's Ed Tully. He's a barber in town.

Director Watson got permission
for us to go outside of camp.

We are going to their park.

Their home field. Ha-ha.

That's great.

Because that is the guy, Dad.

That day in town? This was the guy.

LYLE:
I have to be a part of this.

KATIE: Mama?
SHIRLEY: Mm-hm?

KATIE:
Um...

[KATIE CLEARS THROAT]

I've been accepted by a college.

I'm gonna go.

Katie. Okay.

Delaware State University. What--?

You wanna go to college in Delaware?

What? College? You never talked
about anything like this before.

I have money saved from my job.
I'll use that to pay for everything.

You're not going.
You're staying in Abraham.

When I get called up,
you're moving with us.

Billy.
KATIE: I've made up my mind.

I'm not asking for anything from you--
You're staying with us.

When we go to New York, we're all--

I spent my life hearing about
how things are gonna change.

How we're gonna go to New York.
SHIRLEY: All right, Katie, just--

No, Mama, no.
I don't wanna wait anymore for anything.

I just wanna go.
I wanna do what I wanna do.

BILLY:
You are not leaving home, Katie.

You are not going off to school.

You are not going back to that camp.

You are not seeing that Jap--
He's not a Jap!

[KATIE SCOFFS]

You look at him and you see the people
who killed Billy Jr.

Well, Lyle wasn't over there.
None of the people at those camps were.

We're not talking about that.
KATIE: What are we talking about, huh?

All this time, talking about them.

How they caused all this,
how they killed Billy.

Why don't we talk about
what it really is?

Why Billy Jr. was even there to begin with,
why he wasn't here at home.

Katie, that is enough.
All those years trying to make him like you.

Trying to make him be you.

Forcing him to play baseball.

Making him practice hours
and hours and hours.

He never wanted it.
BILLY: You don't know what he wanted.

BILLY: You don't know anything about it.
He hated it. He hated you!

KATIE:
He couldn't stand being here anymore...

...until finally he ran away to the Navy.

That is why he was there.
That is why he was killed.

It was you. You who killed him.

Shut up! Shut up!
SHIRLEY: Billy!

Shut up!
Billy, no! No!

[KATIE CRYING
AND SHIRLEY PANTING]

LYLE: <i>My father had set up the game</i>
<i>with the Abraham team...</i>

<i>...because he wanted us</i>
<i>to have a chance to prove ourselves...</i>

<i>...to the people of the town.</i>

<i>When I told him I had to be there...</i>

<i>...he never brought up any of the things</i>
<i>that had happened between us in the past.</i>

<i>All he said was,</i>
<i>"You'll have to work hard to be ready."</i>

We're gonna challenge them
to a bet on the game, okay?

All of us together.

All it's gonna take is one quarter.
One quarter will do it.

NORI:
Come on, give me a quarter.

Look, one measly quarter,
that's all I need.

NORI:
One measly quarter each. Okay?

BAMBINO: Whoo! Sweet, kid.
NORI: Put your money on your team.

BAMBINO: Give me another one.
Give me another one.

Once again. Once again. Come on.

NORI: One quarter, your bet.
Our bet on our team.

All of us in one bet, together.
How's that?

NORI:
Drop it on in.

Attaboy.

You got it.

We're gonna get there.
Thank you very much.

[BAMBINO GROANS]


ANNOUNCER: Welcome to Skinner Field,
home of your Abraham Bees.

We've got a special exhibition game...

...between the Bees and a team
from the Topaz Relocation Camp.

Quite a few people from the camp
came out to take a look.

Probably the first time
they've ever seen a real game.

A little birdie put it in my ear today
that Dapper Don Lemon...

...the scout of the New York Yankees,
is coming by today.

ANNOUNCER: Y'all know what happened
last time Don was here.

Yep, that's right.

Jimmy Hollister was called up
to the big club.

Our Jimmy Hollister.

We decided to treat this like any other day,
act like we didn't know he was coming.

I heard he drives a big fancy car.

A brand-new Roadmaster,
and he doesn't even like driving.

[SHIRLEY CHUCKLES]

What the hell is this?
Twenty-five hundred bucks.

What?
Ten thousand quarters.

Every person in camp is in on it.

Twenty-five hundred dollars?
That's a new Cadillac.

Yeah. We like to gamble.

Billy.

These are the guys that wanna put
money on the game.

All right, how much? I'm in.

Two thousand five hundred bucks.

[ED SCOFFS]

What, $2000?
NORI: What?

What's the matter, you scared?
Huh, you yellow?

You don't even belong
on the same field as us.

There's no way we can come up
with that much.

And you guys are gonna back down?

Come on, what have you got
that's worth 2500 that can cover the bet?

Little slants just trying to show us
how rich they are.

I have an idea.

ANNOUNCER: This is a league game.
It was decided that a coin toss...

...would determine which will bat first.
Topaz, you will call the coin toss.

Heads.

Heads it is.

We bat last.

Topaz has elected to bat last.

ANNOUNCER:
Looks like the Topaz team...

...has decided to let the Bees
lead this thing off.

KAZ:
Everybody...

...we know what we have to do
to win today.

But...

...today is not just about winning.

Today is about dignity.

Dignity of the game,
and the dignity we have...

...here.

Enough.

Let's play ball.

You heard him. Who are we?

Topaz!
Yellow!

Let's go, guys.

ANNOUNCER:
These guys are little, and I mean little.

It's almost like looking
at a bunch of midgets out there.

Personally, I always get a kick
out of midgets.

You see a midget, you gotta chuckle.

[CROWD LAUGHS]

Hey, your Abraham Bees leadoff hitter,
first baseman Ed Tully, steps up.

MAN 1: Come on, Ed.
MAN 2: Let's go, Ed.

[CROWD CHEERING]

Do that again. Throw at me.
Throw at me again. Come on.

ANNOUNCER: That had more
than "brush back" written on it.

The pitcher kid winds.

UMPIRE: Strike!
ED: What?

Attaboy, Lyle, attaboy.

Pitcher fella
has a decent-looking fastball.

UMPIRE:
Two!

ANNOUNCER:
There's a fastball right down the middle.

UMPIRE:
Out!

ANNOUNCER:
Strike three. He struck him out.

And that's one down.

Next up, we've got catcher Billy Burrell.

We're all expecting Billy to be called up.
No one deserves it more than him.

I've never known a player
who respected the game more.

MAN 3: Mash it, Billy.
MAN 4: Go, Billy!

ANNOUNCER: My hat's off to Billy.
I couldn't be happier for him.

UMPIRE: Strike!
BILLY: Come on, that's outside.

[NORI WHISTLES]

Hey, it's a little different when you both
have to play fair now, huh?

Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

This time, it's straight up.

WOMAN: Come on.
BOY: Let's go, Burrell!

Straight up.

[CROWD CHEERING]

ANNOUNCER:
Down the line, hooking...

ANNOUNCER: Foul.
UMPIRE: Foul ball!

UMPIRE: Okay.
MAN 4: Come on, Billy.

UMPIRE:
You're out!

NORI:
Beautiful, beautiful.

That's the way to do it, now.
That's the way.

ANNOUNCER: These guys have never seen
anything like Grover.

Grover really had a shot
a few years back.

He told me that Don Lemon himself
came to take a look at him.

Talked to him about
working on his curve ball.

Coming to the plate...

...this must be, let's see, Takeshita.

UMPIRE:
Ball one.

UMPIRE:
Strike one.

UMPIRE: Strike two.
ANNOUNCER: Grover winds.

UMPIRE: You're out!
And down he goes.

ANNOUNCER: As next batter,
this pitcher kid's coming up.

Come on, Grover, come on.

ANNOUNCER:
A little tap down the line.

That's two down.

Let's forget about this exhibition game.
Teach these guys a real lesson.

ANNOUNCER: This big fella, I don't know
what he's doing with them.

He looks colored to me.

ANNOUNCER: I guess he's married to one
of them, or got some of their blood.

Scorecard says he calls himself Bambino.

Got no comment on that.

Grover winds and...

Oh, hey.

They don't have fastballs like that
where they come from.

First inning: one, two, three.
Here comes the pitch.

UMPIRE: Strike!
ANNOUNCER: Down he goes.

ANNOUNCER: Grab some pine.
UMPIRE: Out!

ANNOUNCER: Take your seat.
UMPIRE: Out!

ANNOUNCER: Grover's working a no-hitter.
It's damn near impossible to tell them apart.

Top of the fourth, and Nomura--
Nom-- Nom-- Nom--

Whatever-his-name-is delivers, and--

ANNOUNCER: They don't have any bats,
but their defense is looking good out there.

Where is he?

JOE: Do you want me to go look around
and see if anyone's seen him?

Oh, would you, Joe? I'd appreciate that.

ANNOUNCER: This Topaz kid, now,
I don't know if he's throwing...

...some special
imported pitches or what...

...but he's got himself a shutout
going as well.

UMPIRE: Strike three. You're out.
NORI: We call that his radio ball.

You heard it, but didn't see it.
Did you, sergeant-san?

[NORI CACKLES]

ANNOUNCER:
Grover winds and...

[CROWD CHEERING]

Bambino, I love you!

NORI: Yeah, Bambino!
ANNOUNCER: My, oh, my, see it fly.

ANNOUNCER:
The Topaz team goes up, 1 -0.

Go! Yeah! Yeah!

That calls for a little liquid refreshment.

JOE: He's here.
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

Thank God.

SHIRLEY:
Billy, he's here.

He just got here.
What?

He always reserves a seat when he comes,
and Joe just went to find out where he is.

Oh...

New York Yankees.
New York Yankees.

[SHIRLEY LAUGHS]

ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise...

...for the seventh-inning stretch.

Feel like you could use a haircut?
Don't forget about Ed's Barbershop.

Cut it right, cut it at Ed's.

And join me in singing
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

[ANNOUNCER & CROWD SINGING
"TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME"]

I bought my bus ticket.

I leave for Delaware day after tomorrow.

That's great, Katie.

I won't go if you don't want me to.

No.

No, I want you to, I do.

Really?
Yeah, really.

Oh, God. I'm so scared, Lyle.
I have never been anywhere by myself.

Yeah, I know.
It's nothing to be afraid of, all right?

You're gonna be fine.

I just keep thinking about maybe next year,
maybe you could come, you could join me.

We could be in Delaware...

[SHIRLEY LAUGHING]

[KATIE CLEARS THROAT]

Mom, this is Lyle.

This is my mom.

LYLE:
Hello, Mrs. Burrell.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

It's nice to meet you.

Mom, Dad.

This is Katie.

Hello.

And her mother and father.

ANNOUNCER:
Well, here we are in the top of the ninth...

...and our Bees are trailing, 1 -0.

One on, two outs, and now we got
Ed Tully coming up.

Ed hits a slow dribble
off the first-base line.


Look out.

BAMBINO:
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

What, you wanna hit somebody?

Come hit me. Come hit me, man.
You wanna hit somebody?

UMPIRE:
Hey, catcher, get back behind the plate.

ANNOUNCER:
That's Ed Tully style baseball.

MAN 1:
Stay on the base, Ed.

[CROWD APPLAUDING]

Next up, we got catcher Billy Burrell.

ANNOUNCER:
Nomura's made Billy look bad today.

Struck him out three times.

I can tell you right now, Billy does not
wanna strike out to end this game.

MAN 2:
Go Burrell!

ANNOUNCER:
Two on, two outs.

This game is on the line right here, folks.

MAN 3:
Knock it out of the park, Burrell!

[CROWD CHEERING]

ANNOUNCER:
Bombs away!

Billy just hit a three-run homer.

It doesn't get any better than this, fans.

I'm sorry, sugar. I'm really sorry.

SHIRLEY:
What is it, Joe? What's the matter?

JOE: I found out where Don Lemon
reserved his seat.

Right over there.

JOE:
I made a mistake.

Don Lemon isn't here.

That's a game winner, Billy Burrell!

SHIRLEY:
That's a winner!

ANNOUNCER: One swing of the bat
and your Abraham Bees...

...have taken control of this game.

We can just about call it a day here.

Hey, everybody.

KAZ: I don't wanna see any heads
hanging down.

Every one of you.

I am proud of you.

BAMBINO: We're all here, yeah?
PLAYER: Yeah.

BAMBINO: We're all here, yeah?
PLAYERS: Yeah.

Let's give them something
to cheer about, guys.

Who are we?
Topaz.

Who are we?
Topaz.

Let's go, let's go!

Well, here we are. Bottom of the ninth.

Your Abraham Bees 3, Topaz 1.

All right, let's get this thing over with.
Three and out.

ANNOUNCER:
Grover looks fresh as a daisy out there.

They barely touched him today.

UMPIRE: Out.
ANNOUNCER: And down he goes.

Right, that's one. Okay, we got one here.

ANNOUNCER: Grover had that one slip
against the big colored guy...

...but other than that,
he's thrown a gem.

UMPIRE: You're out!
All right, we got two.

All right. It's all over
but the shouting now.

ANNOUNCER:
We're down to our last out here...

...and I gotta tell you, it was more
of a game than what I expected.

This Topaz team managed
to make a decent contest of it.

BILLY:
Bunt!

ANNOUNCER:
Drag bunt down the first-base line.

No play at first.

Shit. Damn it.

PLAYER:
Yeah!

Come on, now, come on.
Where were you? Come on.

ANNOUNCER:
Now, this next batter, he's 0-for-3.

Gone down on strikes
every time he's been up.

[CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]

ANNOUNCER: Grover's got him terrified
of that high-and-inside pitch.

And I gotta say,
I can't blame the little fella.

[CROWD GROANS]

Look out. That's gotta hurt.

Takeshita takes a first "base-a."

Pardon my Italian.

[CROWD CHEERING]

That puts the tying run on base, folks.

Still got a chance at that 2500.

There's not gonna be any 2500.

NORI:
I'm not saying we're not gonna win.

What I mean is we're not
going to make 2500.

They don't have the money
to put up for the bet.

So, what's the bet for now?

A haircut.

A what?

Our 2500 against a haircut.

That's ridiculous. Ha-ha.

Is it?

You want your quarter back?

I'll give you your quarter back.
I'll take care of it personally.

And anybody else
who wants their quarter back.

ANNOUNCER:
Two on, two outs.

The Bees better quit fooling around
and finish these guys off.

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

[CROWD MURMURING AND THEN
ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

NORRIS:
I'd like a piece of that bet.

You're on.
Come on, Topaz, let's win this thing!

EMI:

One run's gonna score.

The second one's rounding third,
and he'll score.

The throw comes into the plate.
The runner heading for third.

And he's safe. Safe at third.

We got a tie game, 3-3,
bottom of the ninth.

Coming up is the big colored fella,
their so-called Bambino.

Billy Burrell and Ed Tully
going to the mound to talk to Grover.

He's their only real hitter,
so keep it away from him.

Heck, no. I say we go after him.

Come on.

And, Grover, don't screw it up.
I got a lot of plans for that $2500...

...and I sure as hell ain't
giving no haircut. Come on!

ANNOUNCER: This is what it's all about:
pitcher versus batter.

Our best pitcher against their best batter.

Grover getting the sign.

He's gonna throw some smoke,
I can tell you that.

Down the line. Hooking...

UMPIRE: Foul ball.
ANNOUNCER: Foul!

ANNOUNCER:
Grover better bear down here.

Grover getting his sign.

Come on. Come on, Grover.

UMPIRE:
Out!

[CROWD CHEERING]

What? No, no, no. He didn't tag me!
He missed me. Went right over my head.

No tag! No tag! He missed the tag!
LYLE: Yeah, no tag. Listen to me.

UMPIRE:
The tag is good!

LYLE: He couldn't have tagged me.
He was safe.

UMPIRE: Catcher made the tag.
Hell of a play. Way to hang in.

Goddamn it!
This runner is out.

Yeah, I touched the plate.

Of course you did. Game's over.

[ED SCOFFS]

Tie game, extra innings.
Let's go to the dugout.

He was safe.
ED: What are you talking about?

The ump saw, I saw it, everybody saw it.
He's out. Come on--

I tagged him. I made the tag,
but I dropped the ball.

He's safe. Run scores.
I didn't see you drop the ball, catcher.

I know you didn't.

I did. Call it.

Catcher dropped the ball after the tag.
Run is good at home!

No! No, you can't do that!
You can't change the call.

Game is over. Topaz wins, 4-3.
