A doctor with an obsession
with sickness and death.

People who were not supposed
to die were dying.

On a scale of one to ten
in terms of dangerousness,

the chart has to go even
higher than ten.

He left a trail of victims
in his wake.

My father was screaming and
yelling, "Stop the burning!"

He's injecting patients
and then watching them die.

To quench his thirst
for killing,

he hid his deadly secrets

and led authorities on an
epic, international manhunt.

It was a fugitive
investigation

and we're running
out of time.

Always one step ahead,

could this killer
ever be stopped?

I arrested him.
he made bond,

and he's out.

We didn't know what he was
gonna do next.

[dramatic music]

As a doctor
and certified expert

for the California
Medical Board,

I know firsthand that most
medical professionals

will go to any length
to help their patients,

but in some cases there are
those with a deranged mind

and a license to kill.

â™ª â™ª

It's a classic story with
a deadly twist.

An all-American Midwest boy
grows up to become

one of the most prolific
serial killers of all time.

How did he get away with it?

Because this murderer
was in one of the most

trusted, respected
professions you can find.

[eerie music]

â™ª â™ª

I just graduated
from high school,

and you know,
I got to make a decision.

Do I go through
the path of college or

do I choose my childhood dream
of being a paramedic?

So I decided to work as
a paramedic

there at Blessing Hospital.

We had a crew of
16 paramedics.

We would get along well.

We would always
stick around and drink coffee

with the oncoming crew
and just sit and rap

and talk about
the calls we had and--

So yeah, we were close.
We were a close family.

So my first day
of working full-time

I walk into the
paramedic quarters.

In the middle of the table
was a box of donuts.

So I grabbed one,

started eating it,
and I would say about

20 minutes later,
I'm starting to get

this little oozy feeling
in my stomach

and I just felt like
I was gonna get sick.

I go into the bathroom and

that's when
I started vomiting.

Everything that I had
in my stomach

at that point in time
was vomited out.

Once I vomited,
I did feel better

and I went back down
to the paramedic quarters

and there I hear somebody else
vomiting in the bathroom.

Out walks another paramedic
and he just describes

an incident
that just occurred to me.

There's about five
of us that experienced

the nausea and the vomiting.

And so that just seemed
to be odd

how we were fine one minute

and now here we are
vomiting the next minute.

The director is alarmed
by what was going on

and he calls in a team

from the Adams County
Health Department

to come in and analyze
the coffee, the tea,

some of the food that may have
been in the refrigerator.

There were also looking
for the donuts,

but the donuts were gone.

We went to where
the donuts were made

to see if anyone else
had reported sickness

and there wasn't,

so they didn't know
what it was.

I'm working,
state of Illinois requires

an ambulance to be on standby
at high school football games.

So I'd signed up,
and it's about halftime

when my partner,
he says to me,

"Do you want anything to drink?

"I'm gonna go up to the
concession stand.

I can buy you something."

I said,
"Sure, I'll take a soda."

So he comes back
and I started drinking it,

and I would say about the start
of the third quarter

is when I'm starting to feel
nauseated again.

Like, I can't believe this.

I feel like I'm gonna
get sick again.

And as soon as I get
to the parking lot,

there I started vomiting.

And it was
the most horrific vomiting

you could ever imagine.

I am vomiting to the point
where, you know,

there's nothing in me.

I had no idea
what was going on.

I was just thinking
perhaps I had the flu.

In just 48 hours,

there were two incidents
of extreme nausea and vomiting

among the paramedics.

And even though they were
seasoned medical professionals,

they couldn't explain why.

Then when a third wave of
unexplained sickness happened,

fears began to emerge
that it was more

than just a coincidence.

[tense music]

My partner and I
were working together.

We make iced tea,

and my partner and I
both had our glasses,

which had our initials on 'em,

and we filled 'em with tea.

Well, we got a call
and we left.

When they got back,

his partner started
drinking the tea again,

and he noticed there was
a sweet flavor to it.

His partner was diabetic,
doesn't put sugar in his tea.

So he asked Greg, he goes,
"Greg, taste this."

So I picked it up,
took a little drink of it

and I thought,
"Something's not right.

There's something in that."

So we put the tea
in a container

and we took and we locked it
in my partner's locker

'cause we wanted
to have it analyzed.

So then about
two, three minutes later,

one of our other off-duty
paramedics made the comment,

he said, "Boy, I just seen
the weirdest thing.

"Brent's partner was
leaving in his car

"and he looked down the street
and apparently

"seen you guys coming
in the ambulance,

and he threw it in reverse
and he went down an alley."

And the paramedic said,

"It was if he didn't
want you to see him."

By this time,
we'd put things together.

The donuts that made
everyone sick.

Brent went to
the football game.

Soda was purchased.
He drank it.

He was sick.

The tea that my partner drank
was sweet

and he never sweetens his tea.

This is completely crazy.
We're all in shock.

You know,
we're only speculating,

but all the fingers are
starting to point towards

my partner,
Michael Swango.

Things were adding up,
but at the same time

I didn't think he would ever
do anything.

We had no fallouts, no bad
feelings towards each other

that I was aware of.

I had none toward him.

On the surface, he looks
like a good ol' American boy.

[sirens wailing]

But yet one morning
when I'm working with Mike,

he started talking
about ambulance calls

and he says to me,

"My ultimate fantasy
ambulance call

"is when a busload of children

"are hitting head-on
with a tanker truck

full of gasoline
and it blows up."

And he describes seeing
the scene with kids

hanging over
barbed wire fences,

the charred bodies
hanging out of the windows.

And I thought to myself,

"Here we are trying
to save people's lives

and he's describing a scene
where there is no life left."

That, you know, leads me
to believe that he loves death.

With all these circumstances

and all the different
incidents that happened,

we thought we got to get
substantial evidence.

So a few days after that,
Mike went out on a call.

And one of the other paramedics
opened up Mike's duffel bag

and looked in it and seen
full bottles and empty bottles

of Terro Ant Killer.

Now we think we have found
the bullet which he was using.

And so we decided it was time
to go to the authorities.

We obtained
the suspected tea sample

collected by the paramedics
themselves.

And I took it to
the state crime lab,

and then they come back
and confirm that

actually that tea sample
had contained arsenic.

I looked up the symptoms
of arsenic poisoning,

and that was consistent
with the reports

from the paramedics of them
becoming violently ill.

And I confirmed that
the major ingredient

in Terro Ant Poison is arsenic.

Also during
the investigation,

they took samples
of my fingernail,

they took samples of my hair,

and they found high levels of
arsenic in my hair samples.

So at this point in time,
Mike was still working

as a paramedic there
at Blessing Hospital.

So I'm not accepting any food
or beverage from Mike

because I do think
he's a dangerous person.

[soft dramatic music]

The assistant state's attorney
met with us

and said that I think
we have enough evidence

that we can go forth
with trial

and we can go with
assault charges.

I wish we had enough evidence

to charge him with
attempted murder.

We can prove that he had
placed some kind of poison

on the food products
or in the drinks,

but we could not
necessarily prove

that he wanted to kill anybody.

So I was able to obtain

an arrest warrant
for Michael Swango

for aggravated battery.

After I arrested him,
he made bond and he's out,

and then a trial date is set.

So I hear that Mike
is out free.

I'm nervous as heck

because I know what
he's capable of doing.

Is he mad at us to the point
where he's gonna come at us?

And we couldn't take
the change with this guy

running loose in our community.

We didn't know what he was
gonna do next.

So we obtained
a search warrant

in order to get more evidence,

and make a beeline
for his apartment.

As we walked in
Mr. Swango's apartment,

I got a sense that
I was in an evil place.

I was in the presence of evil.

[dramatic music]

Coming up...

My father would tell us
that there was a doctor

that came by and would point
at him and tell him,

"You're next."

He injects
the pregnant woman.

She immediately starts going
into convulsions.

The killer had been
in there minutes

wreaking havoc on the hospital.

At this point,
it was a manhunt.

We're very aware that
the clock is running.

Anybody that has this
sort of compulsion to kill

if you don't catch
them right away,

they're gonna continue killing.

When Michael Swango

When Michael Swango
was charged with

aggravated battery
for poisoning

his fellow paramedics,

investigators secured a warrant
to search his apartment.

They were looking for evidence
to support their allegations,

but what they found was
nothing short

of a one-man
chemical weapons lab.

[dramatic music]

It was something certainly

that I've never seen before
in my life.

I was totally shocked
and amazed at the same time.

It appeared to be
one giant chemistry lab.

It was just something beyond
my wildest imagination.

Mr. Swango's apartment was
mostly filled with

various poisons.

There was Terro Ant Poison
bottles,

some with liquid,
some empty.

And there were recipes cards
in plain sight

with information
on how you make

ricin, botulism toxins,

potassium cyanide.

Then we noticed
he had articles cut out,

and they were tragedies,

horrible crimes,
and shootings,

and stabbings,
and he seemed to be making

a scrapbook out of
all this stuff.

So now we had

a good circumstantial evidence
case against him,

not counting the direct
scientific evidence

of the hair samples
and the tea sample

from the paramedic
headquarters.

With all the circumstantial
evidence,

investigators
desperately needed

to find out information
about Swango's past

in order to help build
their case against him.

Michael Swango
grew up in Quincy,

went to the local schools.

He played the clarinet.
He'd done well in school.

He came from a family that
lived there for generations.

The father was in the military

and he was absent for much of
Michael Swango's youth.

And then he had a mother
who favored him.

He was doted upon.

She really had put all
of her hopes

and ambitions onto him.

I'd found out Mike had gone
to a medical school

down at Southern Illinois
University.

He had virtually no friends
in medical school.

He had acquaintances.

He was very self-absorbed.
He buckled down.

He did everything
he was asked to do,

and he got his degree
and went on

to a prestigious residency
and internship.

People thought he was
very odd and peculiar.

He had a nickname,
"00 Swango,"

which meant "License To Kill,"
after the James Bond character,

but it was kind of a joke.

Nobody seriously thought
that he had killed.

He was right at
the point of becoming

a full-fledged doctor

when he had to complete
his internship,

and he went to Columbus, Ohio
to finish up.

The alarm bells went off
at Ohio State

because his internship
had been terminated

after some very, very
suspicious deaths

and quite a bit of evidence

that he might have been
directly involved.

There were eye-witnesses
in many cases

who saw him inject something
into the patient.

Moments later,
that patient is paralyzed,

dies.

The records show that there
were more emergency calls

where people are on
the brink of dying

in the weeks
that he had been there

than there had been in
the entire previous year.

But no charges
had ever been filed.

The investigation was cursory,
it was fumbled.

The last thing they wanted was
word that a potential killer

had been in their midst,
wreaking havoc

on the hospital and
killing his patients.

So he finished
his internship

and they then said,
"No, you cannot come back

as a resident."

But they were willing
to give him

these glowing recommendations

just as long as he went
somewhere else.

â™ª â™ª

With knowledge of Swango's
suspicious past,

prosecutors in Quincy
were under pressure

to make the charges stick.

So six months after
Swango's arrest,

the DA began presenting
their case at trial.

[tense music]

â™ª â™ª

I believe there were
68 physical exhibits

offered into evidence.

â™ª â™ª

Some of the evidence
that Billy Myer had

was that Mike Swango was seen
going into the local store

wearing his paramedic uniform,

and bought all of
the Terro Ant Poison

that they had in stock,

which would be enough to poison
one heck of a lot of ants.

That was a fascinating
part of the case,

because if he's so smart,

why was he leaving
a trail like this?

At trial, Michael tried to
come up with an explanation

why he had all
the Terro Ant Poison.

He claimed that he had
a severe ant problem.

And so he had called
our local exterminator

who went out and looked
at these ants

that were running all over
his apartment,

which weren't there when we
executed the search warrant.

The exterminator testified
about the ants, and he said,

"Those ants are not
indigenous to the Midwest.

They're only found in Florida."

I'd learned that he had
surreptitiously,

while free on bail,
went to visit his mother,

I believe in
Fort Myers, Florida,

and brought ants
home with him in a box.

He thought he was smart enough
to use ants in his apartment

as an explanation for
the Terro Ant Poison,

but he didn't consider
those ants

don't belong
in the state of Illinois.

So it was things like that
that made him unbelievable,

and I ultimately concluded
that he was lying.

So I was in the courtroom

when the verdict was handed
down by Judge Cashman.

And to our relief,

the judge convicts him
of assault.

So all the paramedics
that were involved,

we were relieved.

All of our work paid off.

It was just like,
"Oh, finally. Got him."

I was happy, very happy.
We all were.

He was charged with seven
counts of aggravated battery

by administering
a toxic substance.

And he gives him five years,
so at that point in time

I know that he's gonna
be in prison.

And while he was in prison,
he sent me a Christmas card

wishing my family
a safe Christmas.

He didn't wish me
a safe Christmas.

He wished my family
a safe Christmas.

And he was in prison,

but I knew he wasn't going
to be there forever.

Unfortunately,
the satisfaction

over Swango's conviction
was short-lived.

Just 21/2 years into
his prison sentence,

he was released and a new
nightmare was about to begin.

Michael Swango served time

Michael Swango served time
for poisoning his co-workers

and had his medical license
revoked in Illinois,

but incredibly,
that didn't stop him

from practicing medicine
elsewhere.

He was able to land a job
as a doctor

at the University
of South Dakota

by telling a half truth.

He acknowledged his
aggravated battery conviction,

but lied saying

he had been unjustly convicted
for a bar fight,

which was terrifying
because at that point

he was working in
a different state

where no one knew
he poisoned his co-workers.

[suspenseful music]

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

He was hired to be
a full-fledged doctor again.

And obviously
the hospital did not know

about Michael Swango's past.

After working there
a little over a year,

a TV show ran a piece
about him.

Why all the poisons
in your house?

And it revealed the whole
poisoning episode in Quincy.

Back in 1986,
while Swango was in prison,

he was interviewed
by "20/20"

about his poisoning
conviction.

An excerpt from that interview

re-aired while he was working
in South Dakota

which blew his cover.

There was the ant poison,
and the gopher poison,

and then the arsenic.

All I know is I had
an ant problem

and I took care of it
as best I could.

I did not do these things.

It's hard to believe you.

Well, I'm sorry.

And that created a furor
in Sioux Falls.

Are you--
take this to court if you...

I really can't say why.

The bad publicity
was horrendous.

I can't live this way.
I can't--

Please, come on.

And so he had to be
terminated from

the University
of South Dakota,

and he left.

After suffering such
incriminating press,

a high-profile firing,
and an assault conviction,

surely Michael Swango
would never be allowed

to step foot in
another hospital again.

Yet just six months later,

he obtained a medical license
in New York,

this time by exploiting
a weak spot in the system.

[tense music]

â™ª â™ª

He does apply to
a psychiatric residence at

the Veteran's Hospital on
Long Island in New York State.

And that was clever because

it's hard to recruit people
for psychiatric residences.

Doesn't have the pay,
the prestige

that some branches
of medicine have.

So he found that vulnerability.

And amazingly after
all of this,

the people in Long Island
were even less thorough

in vetting him than they
had been in South Dakota.

On his job application,
he claimed his sentence

where he went to jail
was commuted by the governor

and all of his rights
and privileges

and everything else
had been reinstated.

Basically, he lied.

He didn't say
he had been convicted

of poisoning people
in Illinois.

Bu you know, he was smart.
He was articulate.

He could be very charming
when he wanted to be,

usually when he had some goal

he wanted to accomplish
for himself,

like working with patients.

My father was a patient
at the VA hospital.

[somber music]

He was known as Tom, or Tommy.

He had a lot of friends.

He was a very personable
person.

And he was in the army
all during World War II.

He was a flag waver.

One day, Dad was on
a ladder and he fell.

He couldn't move
his legs anymore.

He ended up going
to the VA hospital.

After several months
in the hospital,

rather than improving,

tom developed some
inexplicable complications.

One time we went up
to the VA hospital to see him.

We see them
wheel this bed out.

And his arms were failing,

and he was screaming
and obviously in pain.

He kept saying,
"Stop the burning."

They just told us that he had

a staph infection
in the brain.

"We're doing everything
we can."

He ended up in
the Intensive Care.

I'm like,

"There's something wrong here.
What's going on?"

We didn't see anything
life-threatening

when we went
into the hospital.

And...

from Intensive Care,
we kept seeing this doctor

who would ask my mother to
sign the "Do Not Resuscitate."

And this went on
for quite a few days.

And finally I had
turned around and I said,

"Wait a minute, why do you need
a 'Do Not Resuscitate'?"

Because I knew when you sign
a "Do Not Resuscitate,"

it is signed.

You don't have to repeat
it every day.

So this doctor just did not
give me a good feeling.

His name was Dr. Swango.

[dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

He was in ICU for two weeks

when he started saying things
that were very strange.

He would tell us
that there was a doctor

that came by every night
and would point at him

and tell him,
"You're next."

And we would just
brush it off like,

"This man's hallucinating."

He was like,
"They're gonna kill me."

I was like, "Dad,
nobody's gonna kill you.

You're here to get better."

[somber music]

â™ª â™ª

And the one night that
we did not go up there,

it was about 8:00 at night,
we got a phone call

that he'd passed away.

Nobody expected him to die.
He was in good health.

I couldn't believe
this was happening

'cause he was my father.

â™ª â™ª

By the fall of 1993,

By the fall of 1993,
Michael Swango

had been working at
the VA Medical Center

on Long Island for four months

when out of the blue,
the administration

received
an alarming phone call.

[tense music]

â™ª â™ª

The head of the medical
school in South Dakota

where Swango had been
terminated

called the dean of the
Veteran's Hospital

and briefed him
on Swango's true past.

And so the director
of the medical center

made the decision
he should be terminated

for misrepresentation
on his application.

And I escorted him
off the campus.

â™ª â™ª

By this time, panic had
set in at the medical center.

So we started going over
patient charts

for every one of the patients
that Swango had treated.

We did see some irregularity.

Several patients who had been
under Swango's direct care

had inexplicably died

from causes unrelated
to their original diagnosis.

Officials at the VA Hospital
needed to question Swango

and collect more evidence
to prove his involvement.

But, sensing the heat,
Swango skipped town.

So the decision was made
to call the FBI.

While Dr. Swango was
at the VA Hospital,

he came to the authority's
attention

because again, people who were
not supposed to die were dying.

The allegation was that
he was potentially responsible

for all of these
suspicious deaths.

I really wanted to get a--
an understanding--

who is this guy?
What's motivating him?

And so I started to
get the sense

that this was somebody
that doesn't feel good

unless they're actually
victimizing somebody.

He's poisoning other people
just to watch the reaction,

to sort of relish
in their misery.

I think it's clear that
he shares a lot of traits

with psychopaths:

egotistical, no conscience.

On a scale of one to ten
in terms of dangerousness,

the chart has to
go even higher than ten,

because murdering patients,
it's almost a fixation.

So there's an urgency
in finding this guy

because anybody that has this
sort of compulsion to kill,

if you don't catch them
right away,

they're gonna continue killing.

[dramatic music]

At the time,
there really was no hard proof

that Dr. Swango was a killer.

So the best we could do with
the early parts of the case

were charge him with lying
to federal officials.

In that when he made
his application

to come into the residency
at the VA,

he had lied about his
previous felony conviction.

Not many people
read the fine print

on the bottom of
a federal application,

but it says,
if you lie on this thing

you're guilty of misstatement,

and the exposure time
is five years.

So while we're trying
to find out and gather proof

that he's killed people,
to buy time we may be able

to charge him with a violation.

And the warrant is issued,

but the basic first step
was to find him.

No one knew where he was.

He seemed like
he had just vanished.

My feeling is this guy is
gonna surface somewhere again,

and it's gonna be around
more dead bodies.

So at this point,
it was a manhunt,

it was a fugitive
investigation.

With the feds
in hot pursuit,

Swango was running out
of places to hide.

His solution,
he fled the country.

The authorities
didn't yet know it,

but Swango made it
all the way to Africa.

Why Africa?

It offered a market desperate
for doctors

where Swango could avoid
a thorough background check

and do what he loved most,

attend to patients as
a full-fledged physician.

[tense music]

â™ª â™ª

He wasn't even there
too long

before all of a sudden,
patients started to die.

He targets, in one case,
it's a pregnant woman.

And he injects her.

She immediately starts
going into convulsions.

And she-- she actually survives,

but she tells the nurses
that it was Swango,

and he denies it.

[lightning crackling]

[eerie music]

â™ª â™ª

The nursing staff saw him
coming into the ward

at all hours of the night,

and standing over patients
that weren't even his.

The nurses there were
very, very frightened of him.

For the first time
in this case,

the medical authorities

notified the police
immediately,

and Swango's privileges
were suspended,

and they started
their own investigation.

While the police were trying
to investigate him,

it appears that he fled.

So it's telling me
that maybe this guy

is even more prolific
than any of us imagined.

[dramatic music]

Swango was accused
by Mnene Hospital

of poisoning seven patients,
five of whom died.

Once again, he fled before
authorities could detain him.

And once again,
his plan appeared to be

to find a new venue for
his murderous ways.

[suspenseful music]

We received a call
from the agent

down at
the Chicago O'Hare Airport.

And he said, "Jim, I've caught
a fugitive you're looking for.

"His name is Michael Swango.

And he just got off a plane
from Africa."

And he said, "I see you want
him for a minor felony, for

a false statement regarding
his federal application."

And I said, "I've been looking
long and hard for this guy

and he's very dangerous
despite the low charge."

[tense, dramatic music]

So he was arrested,

and they transported
him back to New York.

â™ª â™ª

He was prosecuted
after about six months or so.

He entered a guilty plea.

He was sentenced
to 42 months incarceration.

In a federal system,
you do about 85% of your time,

so we knew he'd be
in for about 3 years.

So now that he's gone
for 36 months,

that gives us that time period
to investigate

everywhere Dr. Swango had been

and try to find at least one
homicide in any jurisdiction

that we could prove.

You know, we have a short
period of time to do this,

with the full knowledge that
if we can't and he's released,

that he's going to continue
what he's been doing

for the last 10, 15 years.

You have to be right
because if you aren't,

the circumstances
are that other people

are probably gonna die.

After an international

After an international
manhunt, the FBI finally had

fugitive Michael Swango
behind bars,

but not for long.

Even though officials
suspected him

of being a serial killer
with an appetite for poison,

they couldn't prove it.

So they brought him down
on a lesser charge,

hoping it would buy them time
to build a murder case.

But could they amass enough
evidence to convict him

before his impending
release date?

[pensive music]

â™ª â™ª

This particular case raised
substantial challenges

in a number of ways.

First,
the stories we were hearing

about Michael Swango poisoning
people dated back to 1983.

We're sitting here now in 1998,

so if we're going back
15 years on cases,

he was in multiple
jurisdictions.

And we sent our team members,

you know,
to every jurisdiction.

They went to Ohio.

They went to South Dakota.

They went to Quincy.

They went to Africa.

We had every single file

from every hospital
that he was in.

We had medical examiners
looking to see

whether the persons that
ended up being deceased,

was it a natural death
or was there some suspicion

here that we should look
further into?

In the Northport VA,

we concentrated
on three people.

One of the persons
was an individual

by the name of Tom Sammarco.

Tom Sammarco had gone to the
VA for a routine procedure.

Based on the admission reports

and we know
the ultimate demise,

it shouldn't have happened.

[tense music]

â™ª â™ª

I'd contacted his daughter.

I said that the VA had
several, what we feel may be

suspicious deaths
that took place,

and that one of the--
one of her father's

treating doctors,
Michael Swango,

may have been involved.

It was like, "Oh, my God.
I remember him."

Dr. Swango was the doctor
that came by every night

and asked my mother to sign
a "Do Not Resuscitate."

You know when you get
that gut feeling

that something's not right?

It was like that gut feeling.

There was just something
that would get under my skin

when I see him.

Tom Valery explained
to us that they wanted

permission to exhume
my father's body.

So my mother said, "Okay."

And she looked at me
and I said,

"Whatever you want, Mom."

â™ª â™ª

We did exhume three bodies,
and our medical experts

did the medical testing on them
and gave us the proof

that they did not die
from natural causes.

They did not die
from the illness

they were brought into
the hospital, but in fact,

had died because they
were injected with a drug.

Our experts found two
different drugs in the body.

One was succinylcholine.
The second one was epinephrine.

Succinylcholine is
a skeleton muscle relaxant

that causes short-term
paralysis

and is used during surgeries
as part of general anesthesia.

It's not natural to the body,

so investigators knew it
had been injected.

Epinephrine, the other drug
that was detected,

is naturally produced
in the body,

but not to the high degree that
was present in these cases.

So once we exhumed the bodies
and did the scientific testing,

that was the first time
that we knew we had

real, tangible evidence
of a murder case.

We got a call,
and Tom told us

that they did find a chemical
in my father's body

and that this is what may have
caused my father's death.

So I began to
start questioning things.

Maybe it's possible
my father was murdered.

[melancholic music]

â™ª â™ª

And we didn't believe him
when he told us

that he was going--
he was gonna be murdered

by someone in the hospital.

We thought he was
hallucinating.

And the guilt,
it just keeps living on.

Maybe if we had
believed my father,

he wouldn't have been dead.

Detectives had proven

the patients were poisoned
at the VA hospital,

but in order to charge Swango
with those murders,

they still needed to either

directly link him to the
poisons used on the victims,

or get a confession.

We're very aware that
the clock is running.

In two weeks, the door opens,
he gets out.

And we had such a hard time
finding him the first time.

I'm very concerned
that if he does get out,

we'll never see him again
and they'll be

many more deaths
associated with him.

Tom Neer and I decided
we would go out,

try to talk to Dr. Swango

and see what he would give us.

As we go in for
the interview,

Swango is escorted in
and I was unprepared to see

how disheveled and how drawn
his countenance was.

He did not look like the brash,

arrogant person
that I was expecting.

Another inmate tried
to slash his throat,

missed, and he's got
a scar right across his face.

He has a defeated look
in his eye,

and we could tell, of course,

that he's very frightened to be
around the other inmates.

So Tom Neer decided on
a good interview strategy.

Collectively, we've learned
in

the behavioral analysis unit

that with people that have

the kind of characteristics
that he has,

no real remorse over
other people,

very egotistical,
very arrogant,

they're not gonna confess
on something

based on emotion.

They're gonna confess
to something

based on self-interest
and preservation.

And so we said,
"Well, Mike, actually,

"we didn't come here
to interview you.

"We came to give information.
We want to tell you something.

"You're about ready to be
released in the next few days,

"but actually,
you're not gonna get released.

"We're gonna extradite you
to Africa

to answer the attempted murder
things over there."

And I slide their warrant
and the extradition treaty

which had just been
ratified with Zimbabwe,

and I said, "I'll make sure
the Zimbabwe authorities

get everything they need
to conduct a fair trial."

What a sociopath
will always do

what's right in
the moment for him.

In Zimbabwe,
he'd probably be executed.

So if he wants
to save his life,

he should probably talk to us.

It's either Africa

or you're gonna take
a plea here.

So it's your choice.

And he comes across
the table and goes,

"You know and I know!

The only way I'm coming back
from Africa is in a body bag."

Dr. Swango is due to get

Dr. Swango is due to get
out of prison

at some time by
the end of July.

So we maybe have two weeks
to get a confession.

So we went to the prison
to talk to Dr. Swango.

And we told him, "we're gonna
put you on a plane,

and we're all gonna take you
back to Zimbabwe."

[dramatic music]

So Dr. Swango said,
"They'll hang me."

He goes, "They'll hang
me very quickly

if you send me back to Africa."

And I just said, "Well,
you picked your venue."

By the end of
the conversation,

what we worked out
was Swango said,

"I'm not saying
I did anything,

but if I did do something,
I'll do time here."

I said, "Well, Mike,
what if you took a plea here

"for some murders here
and we were to get you

your own cell and you had your
own TV here in America."

He didn't want to be
sent back to Africa

where he would eventually
be executed

and he didn't want to serve
his prison time

in a general population
situation

where there'd probably be
another attempt on his life.

So Dr. Swango pretty much

negotiated with us
there on the spot.

I was very excited.
Tom was very excited.

While I didn't get
a confession,

I really thought we had
generated a plea.

[dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

One week before
his scheduled release,

prosecutors filed
an indictment against Swango.

This was not an indictment
where we were just charging

murders at the VA.

We formulated an indictment

that went back to 1983,

encompassed everything that,
you know,

he did in the last 15 years
or so.

Michael Swango
was willing to admit

that he had killed people in
the Northport VA and elsewhere.

And he had two requests,

that we take the death penalty
off the table

and that he not be extradited
back to Zimbabwe.

It was a good deal in my eyes
and I believe,

you know, why everyone
agreed to it is

we did have some fears
if we went to trial,

we didn't know what the outcome
of that trial would be.

Here we had certainty.

He was going to serve life
without parole,

so there was complete certainty

that he would never
get out of jail.

And then lastly, it was
closure for the families,

where they didn't have
to relive this

by coming in and testifying.

[tense, dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

Swango was in the well
of the courtroom,

and he goes very quiet

and he admits to murdering
three of the veterans.

He would serve three
consecutive life sentences

at the Supermax facility
in Florence, Colorado

with no chance at parole.

Then I thought for
the first time in 20 years

what everybody suspected,

that Dr. Swango
was a serial killer,

has finally been proven.

It's one of those
good-feeling moments

in law enforcement
where we prevailed in the end.

I think that's what every
law enforcement person wants,

is to feel like they've helped,
they've given justice.

I'm just glad that
he was taken off the streets.

We've locked somebody up.

No other way to put it,
but he was a monster.

He was a medical doctor,
somebody people look up to,

who was going around
killing people.

My brush with death
was very close,

and I'm fortunate that
Michael Swango didn't kill me.

And hopefully, he'll never see
the light of day again

and be behind bars
where, I think,

that's where he belongs
for the rest of his life.

My father, Thomas Sammarco,

he's a big part of
our life that's missing.

[melancholic music]

â™ª â™ª

And he was a good man

and he never did anything
to hurt anybody.

Michael Swango
was just pure evil.

He destroyed a whole family.

In the end, this diabolical
maniac was brought to justice.

Swango was convicted of
killing three patients

including Tommy Sammarco

at the VA Hospital
at Long Island, New York.

And in a separate hearing,
he was also convicted

of killing one patient
at Ohio State University.

In total,
he's suspected of poisoning

as many as 60 people.
