<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

someone's in my house.

 All right,
settle down, settle down.

As you all know, captain
of the cheerleading squad

Will be announced tomorrow.

I've tabulated
all of your votes,

But ultimately, as always,

I will be making
the final decision.

I don't need to remind you
that being cheer captain

Is about more than proficiency
with your routines.

You all have that
or you wouldn't be here.

Being captain is an honor.

It means that you personify

Everything that we want
in a cheerleader:

Pride, determination,
selflessness,

And above all, integrity.

It means that when
people see you, they say,

"now that's a pine hills
high school cheerleader."

Now go hit the showers.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay, thanks, coach.

You got this, you know.

Come on.
I don't have anything

Come on, did you hear
coach johnson?

She may have been
talking directly to you.

Don't be ridiculous.

Okay, you've been on the team
since freshman year.

You're the best cheerleader
we have.

You head all the fundraising
committees. I mean, come on!

Okay, okay, stop.
You're embarrassing me.

I'm just saying. If you're not
named team captain tomorrow,

There's gonna be a revolt,
and I'd be the one to lead it.

You're my best friend, kate,
and I love you,

But I think you might be
underestimating the other girls.

Okay, then who else?

Big smile, right,
big smile.

Up, down, right.

Anna?

Why not? Did you see
her dismount from the pyramid?

I couldn't do that,
even on my best day.

Em, anna's been here for like,
what, two seconds?

I don't care how good she is.

There's no way coach johnson
is gonna choose a new girl

Over someone who's been here
all of high school.

No way!

Well, I hope you're right.

Have you ever known me
to be wrong?

Sweetheart, I'm home!

Hey, mom.

Hey.

Mmm! What's for dinner?

Caesar salad
with grilled shrimp.

And I think
there's some leftover

Chicken teriyaki skewers
from last night.

Ah, you spoil me.

That's okay. I enjoy cooking.

You know, one of these days,

You're gonna make some man
very happy.

Ew, mom,
that's so old-fashioned.

okay, okay.

I'm gonna put my things away,
and I'll be right back.

Okay.

Nice! So how was practice?

Fine. Emma's nervous
that she won't be named captain.

Maybe she won't.

Mom, that's ridiculous.

She's basically been
primed for this

Since we were in little leaders
in fourth grade.

Why didn't you try out
for captain?

It's not a matter
of trying out.

Anyone can vote for anyone,

And then coach
makes the final decision.

I just don't want you
to sell yourself short.

I'm not.
I'm just being realistic.

Besides, em is nervous
about the new girl

That just transferred here.

What about her?

I mean, she's good.
Like real good.

You're really good.

I know.

My ego is plenty healthy.
Don't worry.

Well, I'm sure coach johnson
will make the right decision.

Yeah, we'll see.

So how was work?

I know, I know.

You work twice as hard
for half as much.

Exactly.
But I told you a million times

That you should have become
a lawyer instead of a paralegal.

If I had known your father
was gonna walk out on us,

I would've.

Mom, don't start.
Okay, okay.

I just don't want you to make
the same mistake that I made.

And what's that?

That college is for your future
and not just for fun.

Mom, it can be both.

And don't worry. I actually
was planning on signing up

For campus tours
for fall break.

Ah! That's my girl!

And let me tell you something.

If it were up to me,
I would have named you captain.

I know, I know, mom.

So tell me some more
about this new girl.

Okay. Her name is anna barton.
She just transferred here,

And she already thinks
that she becomes captain.

Hmm.

You have nothing to worry about.
Will you stop it?

<i> I won't sleep tonight.</i>
<i> I know it.</i>

<i> I'm gonna spend the entire</i>
<i> night staring at my ceiling.</i>

Then text me every minute,

Like I did to you
the night before sats.

<i> Nighttime 7-eleven run?</i>

I can't.
I'm already dressed for bed.

Besides, I promised my mom I'd
sign up for some campus tours.

Hey, call shane.

You know he'd be over
before you even hang up.

<i> Shane is good</i>
<i> for a lot of things.</i>

<i> Patient reassurance</i>
<i> is not one of them.</i>

<i> That's what you're for.</i>

Yeah, but at least he can
take your mind off of it.

That's what he's for.

<i> That's true.</i>

<i> Okay, I'll call him.</i>

<i> But I'm serious.</i>
<i> If you hear that 3 a.M. Ping,</i>

<i> You better not pretend</i>
<i> to be asleep.</i>

I swear.

Love you.

<i> Love you too.</i>

 Am I in trouble?

Why would you think that?

Because in my experience,

When you're asked to come
to the principal's office,

It's never a good thing.

Well, in this case,
you have nothing to worry about.

So I was just looking to see
how you were liking pine hills.

Really?
Of course.

It isn't easy
to transfer to a new school,

Especially
for your senior year.

Well, it's okay, I guess.

Okay, well, is there
anything that I can do

To make your transition
easier for you?

No, no, I don't think so.

Oh, okay, well, if there is,
you know where to find me.

Thank you, ms. Simpson.

Sit down, miss barton.

There is one more thing.

Pine hills isn't necessarily
a small school,

But in many ways,
we are a tight-knit community.

You know why
I'm telling you all this?

I believe you do.

I reviewed your transcript,

Which I would do
for any incoming student.

Um, academically,
very impressive.

Thank you.

But as important
as academics are,

There are things
which are equally important.

Occasionally, we have issues
like any other high school does,

But overall, I'm happy to say
that we're not plagued

By many of the problems other
high schools are plagued with.

Is there something
you'd like to say to me, ma'am?

I guess the best way to say this
is, in my experience,

There are people
who avoid trouble,

And then there are people
who trouble seems to follow.

And you're wondering
which one I am.

Can you blame me?
That was an accident.

It could have happened
to anyone.

An accident which cost you

Your position
on the cheerleading squad,

Which is one of the reasons
that you're here at pine hill.

You don't have to worry
about me, ms. Simpson,

I assure you.

 All right, people,

I've kept you waiting
long enough.

This year's cheer captain,

As voted on by her peers
and fully supported by me,

Is none other...
Than emma rogers.

go, emma!

Yay!

Whoo!
Yes!

Congratulations, emma.

Thanks, anna.

You deserve it.

Congratulations.

It was well-deserved.

Is there anything that you'd
like to say to your teammates?

Um, I just want to thank
everyone who voted for me.

And those that didn't,

I still promise to be
the best cheer captain possible

And represent all of you,
the squad, and the school.

Now let's get to work!

Left...

Anna, come on in.

Do you have a minute,
coach johnson?

Always, anna.

Now, what's on your mind?

Well, it's...

Just that I was a little
surprised by the decision.

Oh?
Well, I was kind of hoping

That I would be named
cheer captain.

And you think
that you deserve it?

If I'm being honest,

I really believe I'm a better
cheerleader than emma.

I have better stamina,

I get higher on the jumps,
my landings are clearer.

I can-- I can do
all these other things--

Miss barton,
I've already explained

That being captain isn't
determined by your skills.

It's also about
your dedication to the team.

Yeah, but I am dedicated, coach.

I take the team rules
as seriously as anyone.

Look, you're talented.

Very talented.

And I shouldn't be saying this,
but if it wasn't for emma,

You would've been named
cheer captain.

Really?

But you just moved here.

I had no choice!

My other school, I just--
I couldn't go back.

Do you want to talk about it?

Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

The point is, the other girls,
they hardly know you.

I've been doing cheer
my entire life.

My mom was the captain
of her college team.

I wanted this really badly.

I understand. I do.

The good news is there's going
to be plenty of opportunities

Throughout the season for you
to take a leadership role.

I am a senior!
By then, it won't matter.

There can only be
one cheer captain.

It's natural
for the other cheerleaders

To feel disappointed.

The best way to handle this

Is to think of how you can
best help the team.

It's not to be petulant
or sulk.

I understand that, coach.

But you're saying
if it wasn't for emma,

I would be cheer captain, right?

It's a moot point.

But that is what you said.

What I said is
if it weren't for emma,

We'd be having a different
conversation, maybe.

Thanks, coach.

Have a good day.

Anna!
Oh, mr. Olsen.

You scared me.

I'm sorry. I mean...

You were coming to see me,
weren't you?

Yeah, oh, yeah.

And I think I know why.

I was actually gonna talk to you
about it in class tomorrow.

My quiz.

I'll do better, mr. Olsen.
I promise.

It's not about doing better.

I mean, this was just
our first quiz.

And if I may be blunt,

You demonstrated zero
understanding of the material.

It's just--
I just transferred here.

I understand that.
And at my other school,

I guess my calc class
wasn't as far along.

Maybe we think about starting
off in pre-calc again, you know?

Just to give you a refresher.
No!

I can't.

I really need this for college.

I don't know
what to say, anna.

I'll work harder, study more.
You know, whatever it takes.

If you say so, but you're on the
cheerleading squad, aren't you?

And I assume
that you know the rules.

The cheerleaders are required
to maintain a c-plus average

In all their academic courses
at all times.

And from what I know,

Coach johnson is a stickler
for the rules.

Like I said, I'll do better.

You weren't actually coming
to see me, were you?

I-I was! I was just

Dropping something off
for a friend first.

Now let's talk about
the vape pen.

Look, anna, you can either
give it to me now,

Or I can call
the school safety officer.

And believe me, he's a lot less
understanding than I am.

Please.

Come on.

You see, if you know the rules
academically,

Then you definitely know that
there is a zero tolerance policy

For nicotine products
on campus.

And you know the consequences?

Suspension.

What are you gonna do?

Look, it's Friday.

I'm not gonna do anything
right now.

I'm just gonna take some time
and think it over.

Please. I can't lose my spot
on the team.

I'll do anything.

I'm gonna think about it.

Have a nice weekend,
okay, anna?

I always knew I'd be dating

The captain
of the cheerleading squad.

I just didn't know
it'd be you.

Shane!
What?

What about you, kate?

There's plenty of guys on
the team I can set you up with.

Would you leave her alone?

What? It's senior year!
Live a little.

I'm sure if kate wants you
to set her up with someone,

She'll let you know.

Thanks, guys, it's okay.
I can handle myself.

Besides, shane, no offense,

I had my fill of the soccer team
with austin, remember?

That was forever ago.

Besides, austin was a meathead.
You need someone smart.

I don't think you're gonna
find that on this soccer team.

No.

Let's talk about emma.
This is your moment of glory.

I gotta say, the whole
soccer team was pulling for you.

Either one of you, actually.

Oh, come on!
What does the soccer team care

Who makes head cheerleader?

We do care.
We notice these things.

Right.

I was a little nervous
at the end.

Yeah, right!
I'm serious!

I had a bad feeling
anna was gonna get it.

Oh, my god.
Who's anna?

New girl. She just
transferred here senior year.

She good?

Real good.

Maybe as good
as anyone on the team.

She a bitch?

You know I hate when
you use that word, shane.

What?

Well, is she?

No, not really.

It's actually
quite the opposite.

So what's wrong with her?

Nothing's wrong with her.

She just gives weird vibes.

She's like super sweet on
the surface, but underneath...

Totally.
She acted like she was

Super overjoyed
when I was named captain,

But in reality, I think she was
furious she didn't get it.

And luckily she didn't.
There would have been a mutiny.

See, everyone would have been
okay with cari or even skylar,

But definitely not her.

No way.

Hey, where's your better half?

Around here somewhere.

Don't take this the wrong way,

But I didn't expect to see
much of the two of you today.

Now that emma's captain,
she has reputation to uphold.

Yeah, right, like that's
what's keeping you two

Out of the bedroom.

I don't understand why
we both can't be cheer captain.

Hey, I was just kidding.
No.

But like we're both
equally qualified.

Okay, but people voted for me.

I don't know how it worked
at your other school,

But we knew there's only
one cheer captain.

I'm sorry that this
hurt your feelings.

It's going to happen,
and I'm gonna make a change!

What do you think
that's about?

I have no idea.

Let's go see.
Make sure em's okay.

Did you hear that?
No, but we saw it.

What's going on?
Just forget it.

Come on, em, tell me.

Well, I approached her,
you know, just to be nice,

And I asked her
if she's having a good time,

And if she wanted me
to introduce her to anybody.

My little cheer captain.

Do you know what she
had the nerve to ask me?

She asked me if we can go
to coach johnson together

And ask her if we can be
co-cheer captains.

No way.
Yes.

She kept going on about how she
deserves to be cheer captain

And how she's the best one
on the team.

She said all that?

Mm-hmm.
Okay.

Look, just ignore her, em.

Don't even worry about it.

Yeah, don't worry about it.

I'll get you a drink.
Come on.

Come on, cheer up.

We're at a party.

We drink, we party.

I don't know. My counselor said
maybe I should be looking at

Some of those smaller schools
out east.

I don't think
I could go that far.

It's just my mom and me,
you know.

Yeah, but in my case, my family
is why I want to get away.

Hey, how is she?

Not good.

She's been drinking all day.

That conversation
really got to her.

You want me to go talk to her?
Nah.

I'm gonna get her some water,

And hopefully she feels better
when she sobers up.

I hope so.
All right.

Yeah.

I'll be back.

What was that about?

So anna, the new girl,

She approached emma
about something.

About what?

I don't want to gossip,
but anna--

 Kate, help!
I need your help!

Come in here! Help!

Kate, help!

Emma!

I came in, she was
on the floor just like this.

Emma!
She won't wake up.

Come on, wake up!
Call 911!

Emma!

Emma, wake up!

Em!

Em! Em, wake up!

Oh, honey, I know, I know.

I'm so sorry.

I just, I just can't believe
that she's really gone.

Oh...

Sweetheart,
you can talk to me.

Did emma take something?

No, mom.
Emma didn't do drugs.

She was drinking,
but not that much.

Not enough to kill her.

See, that's the thing
with alcohol.

You kids think that
you're so indestructible,

But you never know how
your young bodies will react

To all that liquor.

I'm not in the mood
for a lecture, mom.

What we need to
take away from this is that--

What we need to take away?
God, mom!

My best friend
isn't even in the ground yet,

And you want to
make a lesson out of it!

Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

Come here, you need a hug.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

This is the hardest speech
that I've ever had to give.

We have to say goodbye
to one of our own.

Emma rogers epitomized

What one could want
in a cheerleader,

In a student athlete,

In a friend.

She was loyal,

Determined,

Kind.

In order to honor her memory,

We must all, every one of us,

Rededicate our lives

To the values
which emma exemplified.

In doing this,
her memory will live on forever.

On that note,
I hereby dedicate this season

To the memory of emma rogers.

To emma.

To emma.
To emma.

As I've said before,

Emma personified what it means
to be a cheer captain.

To fill that role,

I'm proud to announce,

As I am sure emma
would also be proud,

That your new cheer captain
is anna barton.

Look at her.
She can barely contain herself.

Yeah.

 Thanks for coming over.
I really needed a friend.

Shane: Did you go
to school today?

Yeah, only 'cause
my mom made me.

You obviously didn't want to.
Didn't want to?

Kate, I was with the police
all day.

The police? Why?

You didn't hear anything?
No rumors?

Nothing.
You know I'd tell you.

According to the cops,

They found honey in her system.

Honey?
Yeah.

It's slang for tetrobolin,

An anabolic steroid
with a red color.

What does it do?

Well, if you take it long-term
in the proper amounts,

It builds muscle
like any other steroid.

But short-term,
it gets you high like ecstasy.

And they thought
that you gave it to her?

Not gave it to her.
Slipped it in her drink.

Why would they think-- oh!

Yeah. I'm never gonna
live it down.

But they believe you now, right?

I don't know if they believe me,
but they let me go.

My lawyer said they had to.
They had no proof to hold me.

Oh, my god.
Wait, you have a lawyer?

A friend of the family.

My parents called him
right away.

I don't think
it means anything.

Okay, but if you didn't do it,

And emma didn't
take the drugs herself,

Then who gave--
slipped it into her drink?

You have any ideas?

Let's get going.
I'll think about it.

Hey, mom.

Hey, kate. Where were you?

I was with shane.
I told you that.

Hmm, just riding around, huh?

We grabbed a bite to eat.

Come here.
I want to talk to you.

What's going on?

Sit.

Kate, I don't want you
seeing shane anymore.

Mom, he's like the only person

That understands
what I'm going through.

Nevertheless, I don't think
it's a good idea.

Where is this coming from?

It's all over town, kate.
What is?

That shane was the one
that slipped emma those drugs.

Even the police
have questioned him.

Exactly. They questioned him.

If there was any chance
that they thought he did it,

They wouldn't have let him go.

Let me ask you something.

What possible reason does
shane have for drugging emma?

Sweetheart,
I know you may think I'm naive,

But I know what they
use those drugs for.

I hate to tell you this, mom,

But shane didn't need
to drug emma.

And why would you say that?

Because they were together
for a long time.

She was more than happy
to sleep with him.

If anything,
she'd be drugging him.

Oh, that's enough.

What about his past?

His past?
The steroids.

Mom, that was for soccer.

Because of all the pressure
he had on him

To recover faster
from his shoulder injury.

Yeah, that's what he said.

Exactly! That's what he said.

He admitted it
and accepted his punishment.

That's a big deal to be
suspended for three games.

Look, mom,
someone killed emma.

Kate...
What?

Why would someone do that? Why?

Because they were
jealous of her.

Because they thought they should
have been picked as captain.

I hate to break this to you,
but you don't kill someone

Because they beat you out
as cheerleading captain.

I have homework to do.

Kate.

I know you may not
agree with me,

But I meant what I said.

I want you to stop
seeing shane.

Mr. Olsen.
Hmm?

You've got a visitor.

Oh, thanks.

Mr. Olsen?

How can I help you?

I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

Like I said,
I didn't do anything.

But you understand we need
to investigate every complaint.

What complaint?

That is confidential.

Okay, so anyone can come in here
with an anonymous complaint,

And there's nothing
that I can do about it?

Look, you know what?
It could have been...

It probably was some student
that's bitter about their grade.

You see, that is where
we have an issue, mr. Olsen.

Okay, what are these?

You tell me.

I have no idea.

All right,
then how about you tell me

Why they were found
on your computer?

What do you mean,
on my computer?

The police pulled them off
the server, mr. Olsen.

And that's what they found,
so far.

They were found
in a hidden folder,

But not so hidden
that our I.T. People

Couldn't find them right away.

Okay, just hang on a second.

You're telling me
you found these photos

On my school computer?

I mean, that doesn't even
make any sense.

If I did take these photos,

Why would I keep them
at school, huh?

Why, indeed.

I mean, how do you even know
who these girls are?

You can't, you can't even see
their faces in most of them.

They were identified
as cheerleaders.

Pine hills cheerleaders.

I want a lawyer.

You haven't even been
arrested yet.

Then I'm not saying
another word.

All right, well, in that case,

You have the right
to remain silent.

Come on, this is ridiculous!
I didn't take those pictures!

Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

I'm telling you the truth, okay?
I was framed by somebody.

By who?
That new girl.

What new girl?
Anna something.

Okay, let's go.

Come on, this is so...

Did you hear?

Hear what?
The latest rumor about em?

No, about mr. Olsen.
Mr. Olsen?

They arrested him.
Are you kidding me?

I swear. Brittany saw him being
put into a cop car in handcuffs.

What'd he do?

He had pictures of girls.

Eww. Which girls?

I don't know, but rumor has it
it was cheerleaders.

Everyone always
joked about mr. Olsen.

I thought it was because he was
young and students liked him.

I know, right?

He never thought he was sus.

It turns out he wasn't just sus,
he was sick.

You guys talking about
mr. Olsen?

Yeah.

He hit on me, you know.

Really?
Yeah.

He told me
I could improve my grade,

And then he tried...
You know.

Gross.

See you guys at practice.

I'm sure that you've all
heard by now

That mr. Olsen
has been arrested.

Now I realize there are
a bunch of rumors,

But the only thing that I can
confirm at this point

Is that pictures have been
found in his possession.

Now, it's still too premature
to speculate,

But we have reason to believe

That some of the pictures
are of cheerleaders.

Now, if you have
any information

Or any experiences
with mr. Olsen,

Please speak up.

Over the next few days, we'll be
bringing in some counselors

If you need someone to talk to.

I have to go
to an admin meeting,

So I'm gonna leave things
in anna's hands.

Okay, everybody,
let's get going.

All right?

I know this is a lot
to take in,

So if you guys wanna talk after
practice, I'm here for you.

What are you
talking about, anna?

I'm just saying.
I know this can't be easy.

As captain, I'm here for you.

You're not really
captain, anna.

What do you mean?

You're only captain
because emma died.

Nobody even voted for you.
You don't mean that.

Look, anna, just start practice.
We can talk about this later.

Come on, ladies!
Let's get in formation, please!

Okay, ready, arms up.

Arms down, side, side.

Drill that in. Keep it going.
Keep it going, keep it going.

Let's get it together.

Why don't we do
the combination?

Up, down.

Come in.

You okay?

Did you tell them?
I did.

And what did you say?

I tried to keep it as vague
and as specific as possible.

I basically told them
that I'm here for them.

That's good, that's good.
How'd they take it?

Nothing surprises these kids
anymore, ellen.

They didn't hear it
from their parents.

They heard about it
from each other.

Yeah, but we have to make sure
that we are still the ones

Who appear to have
given them the news.

How well did you know
eric olsen?

I was assistant principal
when he was hired.

Got to know him
a little bit. Why?

What'd you think about him?

Between us, off the record.

I thought he might be
the kind of teacher

That would get in trouble
with a young high school girl.

What do you mean?
Oh, don't be naive, coach.

Now, you know just what
I'm talking about.

He's young. He's good-looking.
The kids worship him.

So you're saying
he's the type.

I'm saying
where there's smoke...

No. I just don't buy it.

Why? Because you like him?
You think he's nice?

What did he say
when you found the photos,

When you confronted him?

He denied it, of course.

What did you think he was
gonna say, "you got me"?

I'm just saying
something doesn't feel right.

That's because it is
very, very, very wrong.

That's just what it is.

Let me ask you something now.

How did those pictures
get on his computer,

And who took them?

I-I don't know,
but who alerted the police?

An anonymous tip.
You know that.

And you don't find that
just a little bit suspicious?

Quite frankly, you know what
I find a more suspicious, coach?

Your inability
to accept the facts.

I will accept the facts, ellen,

But I've been doing this
a long time,

Nearly as long as you have.

It's not about protecting
a friend or colleague.

Something about this
isn't right.

Well, until you find out
what that is,

We have to let the police
do their job.

Now, we have a responsibility
to our students, their parents,

And to the community.

come in.

I'm going out.

Now? You have school tomorrow.

I know. I won't be long.

I just need fresh air.

Maybe I'll go get
something to eat.

But we just had dinner
a few hours ago.

God, mom!

Can't I do anything without
getting the third degree?

You act like I'm some juvenile
delinquent or something.

I'm acting like
you're my daughter.

Believe me,
I'm sure miss rogers

Wishes she kept
a closer eye on emma.

How can you say that?

I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be harsh,
but it's true.

No. What's true is that
someone killed her.

You're going out with shane,
aren't you?

And if I am?

You know how I feel about that.

And what about next year
when I'm gone?

You'll have no say over
who I go out with then.

Please, kate.
I don't want to argue.

Yeah? Neither do I.

You been waiting long?

Nah, not really.

I'm surprised your mom
let you come.

She didn't. I just left.

Ooh! Look at you,
breaking the law.

Okay, so what's so important you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

You're not gonna believe me.
Try me.

Okay, I think the new girl,
anna barton, poisoned emma.

I'm sure of it.

You don't think I'm crazy,
do you?

Look, both of us know

That emma would have never
taken those drugs on her own,

So someone gave it to her.

It wasn't me.
It wasn't you.

I don't think it was
any of our friends,

So what's a better explanation?

Unfortunately, you can't just
go around accusing her.

No one will believe you.

What if I have proof?

Talk to me.

So before I came here,

I spent some time on my phone
googling anna barton.

And?

Nothing. Not one single mention
of our anna barton.

Okay, that's strange,
but that's not exactly proof.

That's more than strange, shane.

Do you know how unlikely it is

For someone our age
to have no online presence?

None! No social media accounts,
nothing.

It's like she never existed.

But she does exist.

Unfortunately, we all know that
way too well.

Unless...

Unless what?

I have an idea,
but I'm gonna need your help.

I'm all ears.

Hey.

Hey.

You're anna, right?

Shane.
I know.

Everybody knows.

Yeah, well, that's what happens

When you've lived here
all your life, not like you.

Yeah, my dad's job
forces us to move around a lot.

Where did you live
before this?

Weren't you emma's boyfriend?

I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

I don't know. It's kinda weird
that you're talking to me.

Why?

Because I took emma's place.

Yeah, well, you had
nothing to do with that.

That's true.

Look, I knew emma really well,
obviously,

And I think she'd be happy
you replaced her as captain.

Really?
Sure.

I've been watching you.
You're amazing.

Emma would've liked that.
She always respected talent.

Thank you. That actually...

Actually means a lot.

So, um, I should get going.

I just wanted
to introduce myself.

Not a lot of people know
what I'm going through,

And, uh, I just thought
because you're new...

I could be
a shoulder to cry on.

I wouldn't put it like that.
I'd say... A friend.

My place after school?

Sure.

I'll see you later.

Hey, mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

Sure, honey. Sit down.

So what's going on?

I need a favor.

Okay.

I need you to use
some of your firm's resources.

You know the database
that you have access to?

And find me information
on anna barton.

For what reason?

Just background information.

Kate, even if that wasn't
a breach of protocol,

Which it is,

And if it wasn't unethical,

Which it also is,

I cannot keep feeding
these delusions of yours.

So that's a no?

Honey, you have to let this go.

Emma's death was an accident.

Either she took
too much of a drug,

Or it was given to her
by shane.

Okay, stop! Just stop, mom!

You can believe
whatever you want to believe,

But I'm not gonna let you
tarnish her memory like that!

Okay.

How about seeing dr. Gordon?

He helped
when your father left.

Remember what a bad place
you were in back then?

I don't need reminding, mom.

I'm just saying.

We never thought that you
would get through that,

And look what happened.

I don't need a therapist.

I need someone
with access to information.

And just what are you
planning on doing with it?

I'm not sure,
but anna is not right.

I mean, she has
no social media presence, mom.

It's like she appeared
out of thin air.

Maybe she's just
a private person.

How about that?

And maybe she's a killer.
You know what?

I'm not gonna do this
with you.

If you are not willing
to help yourself,

Then there's not much more
that I can do,

But I refuse...

I refuse to indulge you
about this.

No.

I know I have to decide soon.

I just don't know
which way I'm leaning.

Not that my parents or coaches
want to hear that, but...

I just can't imagine

Suddenly giving something up
you've been doing all your life.

Well, not if I'm gonna be
a pro soccer player.

Yeah, but don't you wanna
play it for as long as possible?

But it's not gonna be playing
at some big-time college.

I'm playing division three.

What's that mean?

It means you take
the crowds at our games

And decrease them by 50%.

Really?
Yep.

Plus you still have
to practice every day,

You have to work out
in the off-season,

You have to stay in shape.

I just don't know
if I'm up for that.

I guess I can see that.

Enough about
the fading soccer star

In the twilight of his career.

What about you?

What about me?

Where are you looking?

It all depends.

On?

On which school offers me
the most money.

My parents, they didn't put
a lot away for my education.

My mom, she always expected me
to get a scholarship.

Academic?

Cheerleading.

Really?

Yup. That's how
she went to college.

Growing up,
I was always expected to win

At every cheer contest
I was in.

If I didn't, well...

If I didn't,
there were consequences.

You could always
just take out loans.

True, but the last thing I want
when I graduate

Is to be saddled with
thousands of dollars in debt.

Yeah, that makes sense.

So you said you moved around
a lot because your dad's work.

What does he do?

He's in the oil business.

As a rig worker though,
not an executive.

Oh, cool.
Where did you move from?

you sure ask a lot of questions.

Actually, anna, I've been told
I don't ask enough.

No, no. It's just
you wouldn't know it.

It's a small town
near kansas city.

Kansas city?

They got some
good steaks there, huh?

I don't know.

I-I don't eat meat.

Oh. Well, I do,
and I'm getting hungry.

Do you wanna get
a bite to eat?

What?

Nothing. It's just...

You're being
really nice to me.

I'm a nice guy.

Yeah, yeah, you are, but...

But...

I told you. It's just...

Come on!

Anna, you take being captain
seriously, right?

Of course.
Well, emma did too.

And I know she'd be happy
that I'm treating you this way.

Come on, don't overthink it.
Let's go get a bite to eat.

Let's sit down.

What the hell
were you doing anyways?

You almost broke my window.

Trying to get your attention.
What else?

You couldn't have called or
texted like a normal person?

I didn't want your mom to hear
or get suspicious.

And she wouldn't be
if my window suddenly shattered?

Good point.

Sorry.

So how's it going?

It's going good, actually.

You don't think
she suspects anything, do you?

Suspects anything?
Not a chance.

Did she say anything?
You know, about her past?

She said she came
from kansas city,

Or rather a small town
near there.

Figures.
That's hard to check on.

But I don't think she did.
Why?

I don't know. I just have
a strange feeling about it.

Something's bothering you
about this. What is it?

She's a little strange, but...

But what?

I don't get the sense
that she could kill someone.

You don't? Oh, what, suddenly
you're psychiatrist now?

What are you
getting all mad about?

I'm not!

I'm not.

I just know that
she's responsible, shane.

Look, the idea was for me
to gather information about her,

Not psychoanalyze her,
and I'm doing that.

So please,
let it play out, okay?

Sorry.

Hey, this is painful
for everyone.

We all loved emma.

Hey, kate, come on in.

Hey, coach, you got a sec?

Of course. What's going on?

I wanted to talk to you
about anna.

Oh?
Yeah.

In fact, I wanted to ask you
to reconsider.

Reconsider?

Your decision
on making her captain.

A lot of girls
aren't happy about it.

A lot of girls or you?

What's that supposed to mean?

Look, kate, I know that
emma was your best friend.

Of course
it's gonna feel natural

For you to feel protective
for who takes her place.

It has nothing at all
to do with this.

And you're sure.
Yes. The problem is anna.

Okay, well, then
I'm gonna need specifics.

I don't have specifics.
I just have...

I just have a feeling.

This isn't easy, kate.
I know that.

But I hope that you
trust me enough to believe

That I'm gonna do what I think
is right for the team.

Okay?

Mm-hmm.

Thanks for giving me
a ride home.

It's so annoying,
but my dad's car is in the shop,

So he had to borrow mine.

Not a problem.
I'm happy to do it.

By the way,
he's still at work.

My mom too.

Want to come in?

Um, okay.

I like your room.

It's okay, I guess.

Um...
What?

I, um...

can I have a glass of water?

Sure.

Lombard?

Thank you.

I'm sorry, anna.

This...
This is moving too fast.

What is?
This.

Us. It's too soon.

You don't even like me?
Of course I like you.

But that's not the point.
It's not okay.

It's not fair to emma.

Wouldn't emma
want you to be happy?

I'm sorry, I...

I can't.

Shane!

Hey, mom, what are you doing,
dressed like that?

I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I gotta go to the office today.

On the weekend?
Yeah.

Last-minute update
with this case.

Mr. Mcmichaels needs me there
the entire time.

Oh.

You gonna be okay?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

I've got tons
of studying to do,

Plus a few girls were talking
about going to the movies.

Oh, sounds fun.
Need some cash?

Nope. I got plenty.
Thanks, mom.

Okay. Gotta go. Bye.
Bye.

Love you.
Love you too.

Yeah, she just left.

I know,
faster than I thought.

Give me about 20 minutes
and then pick me up.

You know how to get there?

Not a clue.
That's why I have waze.

I just don't want it
to be a waste of time.

Why would it be
a waste of time?

I saw that lombard t-shirt
in her drawer.

I didn't mean it like that.
I meant like a wild goose chase.

Anna could've had
that lombard high t-shirt

For a million different reasons.

Like?

Like an old boyfriend's.

She just moved here
from kansas city.

Or a gift.

Who gives somebody a t-shirt

From a random high school?

And it just happens to be from
the place you just moved to?

Okay, fair point.

By the way,
I'm sorry about the other day.

The other day?
When I was short with you

For saying that
anna didn't seem dangerous.

It's okay.

I was just worried.

About...

She's wonderful
at manipulating people, shane.

I seen her do it to coach.

I just don't want her
to take advantage of you

Without you even knowing it.

Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.

Believe it or not,

I'm a pretty good judge
of character.

It's so ill.
I'd never tell.

Let me do the talking.
Why?

So...

A random guy coming up to them,
asking weird questions?

They're gonna think
you're hitting on them.

Fine. You do the talking.
I will.

I'll just stand here
and look pretty.

I'd never.

Excuse me.

Yeah?

Do you guys go
to lombard high?

Maybe.

My name is kate taylor.
I'm a cheerleader at pine hills.

Good for you.

Do you know anna barton?

What about her?

So you do know her.

Why do you want to know?

She used to go to school
with us.

Used to?
Yeah. She was a cheerleader.

What happened to her?

She moved away.

And that's all?

That's all you know?

Why are you asking us
these questions?

Look, she's going
to our high school now,

And she might have
hurt some people.

So if you know anything
about her, please tell us.

Hurt them how?

Killed them.

Please!

Look, if I were you,

I'd stay far away
from anna barton.

I promise you,
it's in your best interests.

So what do you think?

I think we need
to find out more about anna.

I agree.

I thought you said
she has no social presence.

She doesn't.
I'm looking up something else.

Something happened
at lombard high,

Something that made anna
transfer.

Why do you think that?

Did you see the way those girls
reacted when we said her name?

Come on, what is it?

One sec.

Oh, my god!

Anna's best friend died,
and she found the body.

<i> "last year, a cheerleader</i>
<i> from lombard high...</i>

Thanks.
<i> - Named susie jacobs died,</i>

And the body was found
by her best friend."

I bet that was anna.

But if anna killed her,
the police would be all over it.

Not really. I don't think
the authorities suspect her.

They think susie jacobs
committed suicide.

Why do you think that?

Because when there's
no cause of death,

That's normally
the reason why.

You know, out of respect
for the victim and the family.

If any foul play
was suspected,

It would've been
in that article.

Okay, that makes sense,
I guess.

But if that was the case,
why did anna move away?

Don't you see?
She killed her

And pretended she had
nothing to do with it.

If your best friend died
and you found the body,

You'd be pretty messed up too.

And you could sell the fact
that they needed a fresh start.

It could all seem
so understandable.

That was great, mom.
Thank you.

See? Your mom can whip up
something when she has to.

Right.
Kidding.

I really do wish I had more time
to cook for you.

Mom, we can eat anywhere,
or I can cook.

The work that you do
is really important.

Thanks, sweetheart.

You know, I've been
so busy with work

That I haven't had a chance
to say how are you doing.

Okay, I guess.
I feel better when I'm busy.

That's natural and healthy.

Yeah. That's why me and--

That's why I still haven't
stopped trying

To figure out
what happened to emma.

You know exactly
what happened to her.

Mom, there is something
not right with anna, trust me.

Then why aren't the authorities
looking into it, hmm?

Because they don't want to.

Because it's easier to accept
easy solutions instead.

I love you,

But you are going to drive
yourself crazy with this.

I'm going to bed.
Good night.

Mom!

<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

someone's in my house.

Kate?

Hey.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Look, miss taylor,
I know you're tired,

But it's really important that
we run it one more time, okay?

I already told you
what happened.

I know, I know,
and you did a great job,

But sometimes
when we do it again,

We think of things that
we didn't remember before, okay?

Just a few more questions.
Okay? Please.

Thank you.

So just to be clear,

At no time did you see
anyone else inside of the home,

Except for your mother,
correct?

yes, that's correct.

Okay, then what makes you
100% certain

That someone else
was in the home?

Because I heard them.
I heard their footsteps.

Couldn't that
have been your mother?

No, because when I went
to check on her,

She was fast asleep.

Kate, sometimes we think
we may have heard

Or seen something
that we really didn't.

I didn't imagine this, if that's
what you're trying to say.

No, no, not imagine,

But sometimes when I'm awakened
from a deep sleep,

It takes me a while
to get my bearings.

Mm-mm, no.
I know what I heard.

Fair enough, but, um...
What makes you so certain

It was this classmate of yours,
anna barton?

Who else could it have been?

I mean...

Kate, we didn't find any sign
of a break-in. None.

Can't you at least just ask her?
See what she says.

This isn't much to go on.

It's gonna be too late!

Detective,
let's stop for tonight.

Kate could use some sleep.
We'll finish up tomorrow.

Thank you.

Okay.

I'll see myself out.

I believe you.

Whose side are you on anyways?

I'm on your side, kate, always.
You know that.

Yeah, well, you're starting to
sound like my mom and the cops.

They didn't believe me either.

Of course I believe you.

I just don't understand
why anna

Would want to
break into your house.

Isn't it obvious? To do to me
what she did to emma,

To mr. Olsen,
and to susie jacobs.

Maybe susie jacobs.

I just don't want you
jumping to any conclusions here.

Fine. Just wait.
You'll see.

You think
we should call first?

No, because if she says no,
we're screwed.

She can still slam the door
in our face, kate.

True, but that's harder to do

If we're standing
in front of her.

And if she's not home?

In all the articles I read,

I feel like
the family has money.

The dad has like a good job.
He's the ceo of some company.

The mom can still work, kate.

Okay, they were out of luck.

But I have a feeling.

Come on, let's go.

This it?

It is. 967.

Yes? Can I help you?

Mrs. Jacobs?

Hi, I'm kate taylor,
and this is my friend shane.

Can we talk to you
for a minute?

What is this about?

Your daughter.

My daughter's dead.

Yes, ma'am, and I'm so sorry,

But my best friend is too,

And I think that anna barton
had something to do with it.

Here you go.
Thank you, mrs. Jacobs.

Thank you.
Okay.

So what is it that you wanted
to ask me about anna barton?

If it's not too hard,

What role did she play
in susie's death?

She found her body.

I'm so sorry.

Do you mind if I ask
how susie died?

I'm sure you've read
the articles.

 They didn't say.

Well, according to the police
and the medical examiner,

My daughter took her own life.

You don't believe that, do you?

And what happened
when anna found her body?

It happened at anna's house.

By the time that I got there,
susie had already passed,

And they'd taken anna away.

What do you mean, taken away?

I assumed
that you already knew.

After anna found the body,
she had a nervous breakdown

Or whatever the correct
medical term is for it.

She was institutionalized
for almost a year and a half,

And that was the last time
I saw her.

Why?

She moved away.

Her parents thought that
she needed another environment.

I'd lost my daughter.
I didn't much care.

Mrs. Jacobs, that girl
has just moved into our town

And like I just want
to make sure.

You know, it's strange.

After all that girl has
supposedly been through,

She still has
that same shy smile.

Don't take this the wrong way,
but when you say "supposedly..."

Susie and anna were friends.
There is no question about that,

But I always felt like anna's
reaction to my daughter's death

Was just a little...

Theatrical?

Manufactured.

This sounds awful to say,

But anna always seemed like
the kind of girl

That said what she
wanted you to hear,

But not what she actually felt.

But I can't really blame her

When you have parents
like what she had.

Parents?

Her mother always put her under
a tremendous amount of pressure.

If she didn't live up to her...

Let's just say that
we had very different ideas

Of how to parent a child.

Was she abusive?

As I said, we just had
very different ideas.

And, mrs. Jacobs, I know this is
a very personal question,

But do you know
the kind of drug

That's responsible
for susie's death?

Something that athletes take.

The police weren't surprised.

They said that it was something
that cheerleaders used

To help them perform better.

I can't recall
the actual name, but it...

It's the sound
of something like... Sugar.

Honey.

That's it. Honey.

I can't believe it.
Did you hear that?

I heard it, I heard.

I just don't know if--
what?

It's gonna be enough information
to convince the police.

Are you kidding me?

It's a common drug.

You know how many people on
the team experimented with it?

They just weren't caught.

How many people we know
take it at parties?

True, but if it
just so happened to involve

Two deaths of the people
that she knew...

People commit suicide.
They o.D.

Could just be
a tragic coincidence.

I agree with you. I do.

It's very suspicious, but...

The police may need
something more.

Then you need
to get it for them.

Kate, I've done everything
you've asked, but...

But what?

I'm not a real detective.

I think we just should leave it
up to the authorities now.

The authorities don't care
about emma, not like we do.

We owe it to her.
You owe it to her.

Okay, okay.

What do you want me to do?

I want you to get her to admit
what she did. What else?

come on, kate!

Don't be ridiculous.

I'm not. I know that
you can be very persuasive.

It's totally gross.
That's all I'm saying.

Shane, he should be
ashamed of himself,

Like really ashamed.

Come on, cari,
we don't know the whole story.

There might be more to it.
What's to know?

I see them together
all the time now.

If I were you, I'd be pissed.

Look, it's really
none of my business.

And like I said, there might be
more to it than you know.

Come on, guys,
let's get to work, okay?

Shut up, anna.

What did you say?

I said shut up.

Watch it, kate.

Or what, you'll make sure
I end up like susie jacobs?

Guys, stop.

How dare you bring that up.

Don't touch me, anna.
I just touched you.

You're not even
supposed to be here!

Go back to where
you came from!

I'm captain!
You're not captain!

Yes, I am! How dare you!

enough!

Go home!
I said stop it!

She started it!
You lying bitch!

Enough!

My office, both of you! Now!

Back to practice.

oh, my god.

I am very disappointed
in you both.

This is not the way
that a captain behaves,

Nor is it what I would expect

From one of the most senior
members on the squad.

Now tell me what happened.

one at a time.

Anna, go ahead.

She attacked me
for no reason.

You're a liar.

Kate, you'll have your turn.

Ever since I became captain,
she's wanted to sabotage me.

I'm sorry her best friend died,
I really am,

But that's no excuse
for how she's treated me.

She didn't die.
You killed her.

Anna, please go
and start practice.

I need some time
to speak with miss taylor.

But all she's gonna do
is tell you a ton of lies,

And I won't be here
to defend myself.

Anna, please.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

Accusing her of murder?
Come on, kate!

Coach johnson, you don't know
what I've discovered about her.

I know that you've
had it out for anna

Ever since she was named
cheer captain.

I also know
that you have no basis

For your previous accusations
against her.

Kate, I want to help you,
I really do.

I want you to go talk
to mrs. Simon

Or one of the other
school social workers.

I don't need a shrink, coach.

With all due respect, kate,
I think that you do.

At the very least, she can
help you manage your emotions.

My emotions aren't the problem.
Anna barton is!

Okay, let me say this
a different way.

You will go talk to someone,

Or I will remove you
from the team.

Coach, you've known me
for a long time.

Have you ever known me
to make something like this up?

To act irrationally?

I'm begging you,
keep an eye on anna.

She did it.

I know she did.

Gather round, gather round.

As you are all aware,

There was a minor altercation
before practice.

I've spoken to both parties
to express my displeasure.

Suffice it to say,
it won't happen again.

Sometimes
in situations like these,

I think it's best
for the coach to step aside

And let you work it out
amongst yourselves.

I'll be in my office.

Some of you saw what happened.

The rest of you heard.

So, kate...

Coach?

Mr. Olsen,
what are you doing here?

I need to speak with you.
You can't be here.

Just hear me out
for one second, please.

I could get fired.

If you don't listen to me
about anna barton,

Something worse could happen.

I never touched
any student. Ever.

I never took any pictures.

You believe me, don't you?

That's okay
'cause that doesn't matter.

What matters is that
you believe emma rogers.

We both knew her.

She didn't use drugs,
and I also knew her boyfriend.

And despite
what some people think,

He wouldn't have
given them to her.

You think anna did?

Look, I caught her vaping
on school property.

That's why I believe
that she framed me.

Anna barton is dangerous.

Trust me, you're gonna hear
all about it.

Don't sweat it.

A fight breaks out at soccer
practice like every other day.

Yeah but this was your
good old-fashioned cat fight,

The one that everybody loves.

And she apologized to you
in front of everyone?

Yeah, only because
coach made her.

It was so fake,
like everything about her.

Where is she now?

I don't know.
Gone home, I guess.

No. Her car is still here.

Hmm...

Okay, I gotta get going.

Okay, I'll see you.

Where are you going?

Um, gonna go
check on something.

Do you want me
to wait for you?

No. I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay.

Anna, what are you
doing here?

Where'd you get that?

Your backpack
was on school property.

If we have any suspicion
of illegal activity,

We have every right
to search it.

Then you suspect me
of doing something illegal?

I don't know, anna.
You tell me.

It would've been so much easier,
coach johnson,

It would've been
so much easier

If you just named me
cheer captain.

We went over this already.

All these girls,
especially emma,

They just had everything
handed to them.

No, you know that
that's not true.

They never had
a mother like mine.

Is that what this is about?

Why you moved here
to pine hills?

Because of your mother?

Don't pretend like you
suddenly care, coach johnson.

I do care, anna.

I really wanna help you.

I'm afraid it's a little bit
too late for that.

Did you kill emma, anna?

Did you poison her?

I'm gonna kill you, kate,

Just like I killed emma.

Like hell you are.

Coach! Coach!

Coach, wake up.

wake up.

Mmm! Now, that is
a fine cup of coffee.

Thank you, mrs. Taylor.

You're welcome.
I'm sure the coffee

Isn't the reason
you stopped by, detective.

No, no, it is not. Um...

I've spoken to the police
department in lombard,

And they're looking back
at susie jacob's death.

I've also spoken with
susie jacob's mother,

And she said that none of this
would have been possible,

If it wasn't for you.
Mm-hmm.

We're also re-interviewing
everyone from the party

At which emma rogers
overdosed.

Now that we know
who's responsible,

We're hoping that someone will
come forward with something.

And coach johnson?
She's fine.

She has a nice scar,
but no permanent damage.

She's very grateful
for you too, obviously.

Well, one thing's for certain.

She definitely picked
the wrong cheer captain.

Detective, all of this
that you're telling us

Is nothing that
we don't already know.

Anna barton woke up last night
from her medically induced coma.

And?

And we've had her under
constant observation since,

But she claims
she doesn't remember anything.
