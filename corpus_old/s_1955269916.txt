  CONDUCTOR: River City
  Junction. River City,
  next station stop!

River City next! Board!

 It's them big new department
 stores back East.

 They let folks buy
 anything on credit!

 If I don't give credit,
 I'm gonna lose customers!

You're crazy with the heat.

 Credit is no good
 for a notion salesman.

 Why not?
 What's the matter with credit?

   It's old-fashioned.

 Charlie,
 you're an anvil salesman,
 your firm give credit?

   No, sir!

 Nor anybody else.

  (TRAIN BRAKING)

CONDUCTOR: River City!
River City!

  River City!

We've crossed the state
line into Iowa.

River City,
population 2,212.

  Cigarettes illegal
  in this state. Board!

 All right, if you're
 all through, I'll tell you
 about Harold Hill!

 You really know Harold Hill?

  Never saw him in my life,
  but I know this much,

 he's giving every one
 of us a black eye!

 After he's worked a town over,
 the very next salesman

   automatically gets tarred
   and feathered,

rode out to the
city limits on a rail.

  (LAUGHING)

   You think that's funny?

Well, wait till it
happens to you!

The hair never grows back.

But why should he get
rode out 'a town on a rail?

 Because in order to sell band
 instruments, and uniforms,

 and instruction booklets,
 he has to guarantee
 to teach them kids to play.

 Well?

 And form them kids
 into a band, with
 himself as the leader!

 SALESMAN 5:
 What's wrong with that?

 CHARLIE: He don't know
 one note from another,
 that's what's wrong with that!

  He can't tell a bass drum
  from a pipe organ!

  I'll catch up with
  that swindlin' two-bit
  thimble rigger,

   and when I do I'm gonna
   squeal on him so loud.

  Pardon.

Yeah.

   Sure would like to be
   around when you catch up
   with that fella.

  Me, too.

 Well, it won't be
 on this trip. Not in Iowa.

 Even the great Professor Hill
 wouldn't try to sell to them

 neck-bowed Hawkeyes
 out here, huh?

 (ALL LAUGHING)

 CONDUCTOR: All aboard.

Gentlemen, you intrigue me.
I think I'll have
to give Iowa a try.

  I don't believe
  I caught your name.

  Don't believe I threw it!

 Harold Hill.

  That's him!
  It's you! You're him,
  you're Harold Hill!

  You're Harold Hill.

 That's him, fellows.
 That's him. That's the fellow!

 That's the fellow
 we were just talking about!

  That's... Right...
  That's Harold Hill!

 I won't forget
 your face, Hill!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

  Good day!

 Got a hotel in this town?

  Yeah, it's not in town.

 Can you tell me where it is?

  Straight through town,
  turn right, come to the fork,
  go on from there.

 Left or right?

Doesn't matter to me.

   Thanks, anyway.

 <i> â™ª Oh, there's nothing halfway</i>
 <i> about the Iowa way</i>

 <i> â™ª To treat you when</i>
 <i> we treat you</i>

<i> â™ª Which we may not
 do at all</i>

  <i> â™ª There's an Iowa kinda</i>
  <i> special chip-on-the-shoulder</i>

<i> â™ª Attitude we've never
 been without</i>

   <i> â™ª That we recall</i>

<i> â™ª We can be cold
 as our falling thermometer
 in December</i>

 <i> â™ª If you ask</i>
 <i> about our weather in July</i>

 <i> â™ª And we're so by-God</i>
 <i> stubborn we can stand</i>
 <i> touchin' noses</i>

   <i> â™ª For a week at a</i>
   <i> time and never see</i>
   <i> eye-to-eye</i>

<i> â™ª But what the heck
 you're welcome
 join us at the picnic</i>

  <i> â™ª You can have your</i>
  <i> fill of all the food</i>
  <i> you bring yourself</i>

 <i> â™ª You really ought to</i>
 <i> give Iowa a try</i>

 <i> â™ª Provided you are contrary â™ª</i>

   Good afternoon, Mayor Shinn.

Good afternoon,
Mayor Shinn.

It is, if you wanna
go 'round in your
drawers all day.

 ...and there I was in
 Madison Hospital and
 nobody come to see me.

 Cousin Will never come,
 and Aunt Bertha never come.

Aunt Bertha's dead.

 Ah, she wouldn't
 have come anyway.

 <i> â™ª We can be cold as a falling</i>
 <i> thermometer in December</i>

  <i> â™ª If you ask about</i>
  <i> our weather in July</i>

<i> â™ª And we're so by-God stubborn
 we can stand touchin' noses</i>

   <i> â™ª For a week at a time</i>
   <i> and never see eye-to-eye</i>

<i> â™ª But we'll give you our shirt</i>

   <i> â™ª And a back to go with it</i>

 <i> â™ª If your crop should</i>
 <i> happen to die</i>

  <i> â™ª So what the heck</i>
  <i> you're welcome</i>
  <i> glad to have you with us</i>

  <i> â™ª Even though we may not</i>
  <i> ever mention it again</i>

  (CAMERA CLICKS)

<i> â™ª You really
 ought to give Iowa</i>

 <i> â™ª Hawkeye, Iowa, Dubuque,</i>
 <i> Des Moines, Davenport,</i>
 <i> Marshalltown,</i>

 <i> â™ª Mason City, Keokuk,</i>
 <i> Ames, Clear Lake</i>

  <i> â™ª Ought to give Iowa a try â™ª</i>

 You really ought
 to give Iowa a try.

GIRL: It's not fair.
She started it.

   I'd like a room near a bath,
   please. Facing the back.

Gregory!

  Marcellus!

 Why, you old son of a gun!

  Shh!

But, Greg...

   Hill's the name.

 Professor Harold Hill.

 But Greg, what are
 you doing here?

 Why didn't you let me
 know you was coming?

I didn't know I was myself.

  Besides, how could I know
  you'd end up in a little
  tank town like this?

Well.

 You were a
 pretty big slicker

  when you were in
  business with me.

 Too many close shaves
 hawking for you.

 Besides, I got me a nice
 comfortable girl.

   Ethel Toffelmier,
   my boss's niece.

  Gone legitimate, huh?

I always knew you'd
come to no good.

 So, what's the new pitch?

 Oh, you're not back in
 the band business!

 I heard you was
 in steam automobiles.

I was.

 What happened?

 Somebody actually
 invented one.

  No!

So, uh, give me the lowdown
around here, Marce.

 Oh, you'll never get anywhere
 in the band business with
 these stubborn Iowans, Greg.

 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

 Besides we got this
 stuck-up music teacher
 who'll expose you

  before you get
  your grip unpacked.

 Male or female?

 The music teacher?

 She's a librarian.
 Female.

  Perfect!

 That's what I wanted
 to hear.

 If she passes by,
 point her out to me.

   I will.

  This your best room?

 (CHUCKLES) Afraid so.

 How you gonna start
 the pitch?

 Same old way. Keep that
 music teacher off balance,

   and my next step will
   be to get your town out of
   the serious trouble it's in.

 River City isn't in
 any trouble.

   Then I'll have to
   create some.

  I've got to create
  a desperate need
  for a boys' band.

   You remember. Now what's
   new around here, Marce?

What can I use?

  MARCE: Hmm, let's see.

 Nothin'.

 Except the billiard parlor's
 just put in a new pool table.

 They never had a pool
 table here before?

 No, only billiards.

  That'll do.

  I'll see you downstairs
  in a little while, Marce,

and you can
show me around.

  And don't forget,
  music teacher.

 Music teacher.

   (BELL DINGING)

  (BILLIARD BALLS CRASHING)

   Ha! There it is.

Remember.

   Excuse me, sir.
   Is this your store?

   Yep.

 Well, either you are closing
 your eyes to a situation
 you do not wish to acknowledge

or you are not aware of
the caliber of disaster

  indicated by the presence
  of a pool table
  in your community.

 <i> â™ª Well, you got trouble</i>
 <i> my friend</i>

   <i> â™ª Right here, I say trouble</i>
   <i> right here in River City</i>

 <i> â™ª Why sure,</i>
 <i> I'm a billiard player</i>
 <i> certainly mighty proud to say</i>

 <i> â™ª I'm always mighty proud</i>
 <i> to say it</i>

   <i> â™ª I consider that the hours</i>
   <i> I spend with a cue</i>

<i> â™ª 'J'ever take and try to give

  <i> â™ª From a three-rail</i>
  <i> billiard shot?</i>

   <i> â™ª But just as I say</i>
   <i> it takes judgment,</i>
   <i> brains, and maturity</i>

 <i> â™ª To score in a balkline game</i>

<i> â™ª I say that any boob
 can take 'n' shove
 a ball in a pocket</i>

 <i> â™ª And I call that sloth</i>
 <i> the first big step</i>

  <i> the depths of degrada...</i>

  <i> â™ª I say first medicinal wine</i>

 <i> â™ª Now friends</i>

 (HORSE NEIGHING)

Mothers of River City,
heed the warning
before it's too late.

   ALL: (CHANTING REPEATEDLY)
   Trouble!

   Watch for the telltale signs
   of corruption.

  The moment your son
  leaves the house,

 does he rebuckle his
 knickerbockers below the knee?

  Is there a nicotine stain
  on his index finger?

 A dime novel hidden in
 the corncrib?

 Is he memorizing jokes out
 of <i> Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?</i>

 Are certain words creeping
 into his conversation?

 Words like "swell"
 and "so is your old man."

 Well, if so, my friends,
 you got trouble.

  ALL:
 <i> â™ª Oh we got trouble</i>

 <i> â™ª Right here in River City!</i>

 <i> â™ª Right here in River City!</i>

  No!

I will only be in

 I'll...

  Good!

  (PIANO PLAYING)

  (HUMMING)

 MRS. PAROO: Oh!

  Is that you, daughter?

 MARIAN: Yes, Mama.
 Keep on, Amaryllis.
 I'll be there in a minute.

 Fine, dear.
 Now your exercises.

Yes, ma'am.

 Hello, Mama.

 I don't remember
 the library bein' open
 this late last summer.

 It was, Mama,
 you just don't recall.

Mama, a man with a suitcase
has been following me
all over town.

  Oh! Who?

I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

 Did he say anything?

   He tried.

 Did you say anything?

   Mama, of course not.

  Now, don't dawdle, Amaryllis.

 <i> â™ª Sol do la re ti mi</i>

 <i> â™ª A little slower and please</i>
 <i> keep the fingers curved</i>

 <i> â™ª As nice and high</i>
 <i> as you possibly can â™ª</i>

 Don't get faster, dear.

 If you don't mind
 my saying so,
 it wouldn't have hurt you

 to find out
 what the gentleman wanted.

  I know what
  the gentleman wanted.

 What, dear?

  You'll find it in Balzac.

 Excuse me for livin'
 but I've never read it.

 <i> â™ª Neither has anyone else</i>
 <i> in this town</i>

 <i> â™ª There you go again</i>
 <i> with that same old comment</i>

 <i> â™ª About the low-mentality</i>
 <i> of River City people</i>

  <i> â™ª And takin' it all</i>
  <i> too much to heart</i>

 <i> â™ª Now, Mama, as long as</i>
 <i> the Madison Public Library</i>

 <i> â™ª Was entrusted to me for</i>
 <i> the purpose of improving</i>
 <i> River City's cultural level</i>

 <i> â™ª I can't help my concern</i>
 <i> that the ladies of River City</i>

<i> â™ª Keep ignoring all my counsel
 and advice</i>

<i> â™ª But darling
 when a woman has a husband</i>

<i> â™ª And you've got none</i>

 Ugh!

 <i> â™ª Why should she take advice</i>
 <i> from you</i>

<i> â™ª Even if you can quote Balzac
 and Shakespeare and all them
 other highfalutin' Greeks</i>

 <i> â™ª Mama, if you don't mind</i>
 <i> my sayin' so</i>

 <i> â™ª You have a bad</i>
 <i> habit of changing</i>
 <i> every subject</i>

<i> â™ª Now I haven't changed
 the subject. I was talkin'
 about that stranger</i>

 <i> â™ª What stranger?</i>

 Thank you.

  May I have...

 May I have a drink, please?

  Yes, dear.

 (DOG BARKING)

  (DOOR OPENS)

 Winthrop. It's after dark.

Is that a way to
greet your mother,
I'd like to know?

 Hello.

 Well, that won't do at all.

 I'll have a kiss
 if you please.

  One for your sister, too.

  Hello, Winthrop.

 I'm having a party
 on Saturday.

 Will you please come?

 I would especially
 like it very much
 if you'd come, Winthrop.

 MRS. PAROO: Well, Winthrop?

 Amaryllis asked you
 to her party.
 Are you goin' or aren't ya?

  No.

No, what?

   No, thank you.

 You know the little
 girl's name.

 He won't say Amaryllis
 because of the "S",
 because of his lisp.

 Yeah, we know all about
 his lisp, Amaryllis.

  Well, Winthrop?

 I'll bet he won't say it.

  No, thank you, Amaryllis.

  (AMARYLLIS GIGGLING)

Winthrop, honey!

 Why does he get so
 mad at people
 just because he lisps?

 Not only because he lisps.
 That's just part of it,
 Amaryllis.

 What's the other part?

  Never mind, dear.

 It's just that he never
 talks very much.

Not even to you
and your mother?

 No, dear. We all have
 to be a little patient.

I'm patient. Even though
he doesn't ever talk to me.

 But I talk to him.

   Every night, I say goodnight
   to him on the evening star.

   "Goodnight, my Winthrop.
   Sleep tight."

   (AMARYLLIS SOBS)

 Oh, there, darling, don't cry.

 You have lots of time.
 If not Winthrop,
 there'll be someone else.

  Never! I'll end up
  an old maid like you.

I'm sorry, Miss Marian.

  Can I play my
  cross-hand piece?

 May I play...

  May I play my
  cross-hand piece?

   You may.

 See, without a sweetheart you
 have no one to say goodnight
 to on the evening star.

   I know, Amaryllis.
   For the time being,
   just say, "Goodnight, my..."

 Someone.

You can put the name in
when the right someone
comes along.

 It's better than nothing.

Yes, it is.

  Now you can play your
  cross-hand piece.

   Now I may play my
   cross-hand piece.

That man is a spellbinder.

  Men, this calls for
  emergency action.

 I haven't seen Iowa people
 get so excited

since the night Frank Gotch
and Strangular Lewis
lay on the mat

   for three and half hours
   without moving a muscle!

 Never mind!

 I want that man's credentials.

 There he is!

Oh!

 Very good.

 That will be five
 dollars earnest money.

Thank you very, very much.

 Let me see your hands.
 Piccolo player.

  How's that sound?

  CONSTABLE: Grab that hoodlum!

 He almost blew up Mrs. Shinn!

HAROLD: It'll be five
dollars, earnest money.

  (GASPING)

 CONSTABLE: Hurry, Sheriff,
 after him.

  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Thanks, Professor.
Have to make an
example of him.

 Ringleader, you know.
 What he does, the gang does.

Lemme go.

   You a' wild kid, ya.

 Hanging around
 my oldest girl.

 His father is one a' them
 day laborers south a' town.

   You wild kid, ya.

 Taggin' down Main Street after
 my oldest girl last Sunday.

  I wasn't either taggin'.

 Don't you counterdict me.

 We'uz just walkin' together,
 Jeely Kly.

 You watch your phraseology!

  I know what you'uz doin',
  my little Gracie seen ya.

 Now you stay away
 from my oldest girl

 or you'll hear from me 'til
 who laid the rails!

 Hill! I'll talk to you Monday
 morning about this band thing,
 over at City Hall.

 10:00 sharp.

 I want that spellbinder's
 credentials.

   Constable, I'll be
   responsible for the boy.

 Oh, you don't know this
 kid, Professor, he's tough,

 and he's got his
 gang waitin' outside.

   Oh, I'll be careful.

Tommy, I'd like to talk
to you about the band.

 Aw, gee, Professor,
 that's for the little kids.

  I'm not talking about you
  playing in the band.

   I'll bet you're mechanically
   minded, aren't you?

 Ever do anything
 with perpetual motion?

 Ah, yeah. Nearly had it
 a couple times.

You did?

Then you're my man!

 Do you realize that nobody
 has ever invented

 a music-holder for
 a marching piccolo player?

  No place to
  hang the music.

 Jeely Kly! Wonder where
 I could get some wire from?

   Look in your cellar,
   that's where people
   usually keep wire.

 Oh, Tommy!

   Yes, sir?

  Now, constable, I'll show you
  how to break up a gang.

 Oh, miss.

 Oh, young lady!
 What's your name?

  Zaneeta. I didn't have
  any idea you was
  beckoning to me. Ye Gods.

  Do you know Tommy Djilas?

   Well, I...

Tommy, this is Zaneeta.

Escort the young lady home,
by way of the
ice cream parlor.

 Yes, sir. Do I hafta?

 Ya hafta.

 Yes, sir.

Ye Gods!

 Professor, you're a pretty
 bright young fellow.

  But you made a couple
  mistakes, though.

Oh?

   The Mayor happens to own
   the billiard parlor and
   that new pool table.

  Oh! What was
  the other mistake?

 That Zaneeta.
 She's the Mayor's oldest girl.

 Just a minute, Professor Hill,
 we're on the School Board,

 and we'd like
 to have your credentials.

 Academic certificates.

 Nothing of the kind!

 We need letters and papers!

Make him put up a bond!

Wait a minute.

   Wait a minute,
   what am I hearing?

 Gentlemen, follow me.

   Say

  <i> â™ª Ice cream â™ª</i>

  Ice cream.

 But I don't sing
 if that's what
 you're gettin' at.

 All right, all right,
 talk then.

 <i> â™ª Down here! â™ª</i>

   Ice cream.

<i> â™ª Talk slow! â™ª</i>

 <i> â™ª Ice cream â™ª</i>

   You see? Singing is only
   sustained talking.

   <i> â™ª Now you</i>

<i> â™ª Ice cream</i>

 <i> â™ª Now you, right here</i>

   <i> â™ª Ice cream</i>

  Now you, sir!

 <i> â™ª Ice cream â™ª</i>

 I didn't know
 we could do that.

 From now on,

 you'll never see one of those
 men without the other three.

 hated each other since
 kindergarten! Ye Gods!

   Mr. Hill!

   Professor Hill.

   Professor of what?

 At what college do they give
 a degree for annoying women
 on the street

 like a Saturday night rowdy
 at a public dance hall?

  Well, I wouldn't know
  about that.

 I'm a conservatory man myself.
 Gary, Indiana, Gold Medal
 Class of aught-five.

 Even should that happen
 to be true,

 does that give you the
 right to follow me around
 wherever I go?

 Another thing, Mr. Hill,

 I'm not as easily
 mesmerized or hoodwinked

 as some people in this town

 and I think it only fair
 to warn you

 that I have a shelf full
 of reference books
 in my library

 which may very well
 give me some interesting
 information about you.

 Hey, Greg!

 Hi, Marcellus.
 Don't call me Greg.

So how'd you make out
with the music teacher?

 Ate out of my hand
 the minute I tipped my hat.

 She did? Oh, boy,
 did you cut a swath today.

 For a minute
 even I thought

  you knew somethin'
  about leadin' a band.

 Just like when you
 used to imitate

  that band-concert
  fellow in Joplin.

   Yeah.

 Ah, kid stuff.

   I'm in rare form these days.

  Just keep your eyes on me
  for the next three weeks.

Three weeks?

 It only used to take ten days
 for the instruments to arrive.

  Still does. But it takes
  three weeks for the uniforms.

Oh, no, Greg.

 You haven't added uniforms?

 Uniforms and
 instruction books.

 Instruction books?

 But, you can't pass yourself
 off as a music professor.

 I mean not for
 any three weeks.

   Marce.

 But you don't know
 one note from another.

 I have a revolutionary
 new method called
 the "Think System"

 where you don't bother
 with notes.

  But in three weeks...

 Why that's the Fourth
 of July sociable.

 The people will want
 to hear music.

 You'll have to
 lead a band.

   When the uniforms arrive
   they forget all that,

   at least long enough
   for me to collect and leave.

  Oh, this is a refined
  operation, Marce,
  and I've got it timed

right down to the last wave
of the brakeman's hand

 on the last train
 out 'a town.

And now,
Mr. Washburn...

   If you'll excuse me.

 Gonna line yourself up
 a little canoodlin', huh?

  Uh, well...

 Say, I could fix you up
 with Ethel's sister.

 I'm Mrs. Dunlop,

 Oh, Eulalie,
 isn't this exciting?

Oh, I couldn't say.

   I could not say.

 Oh, no. I could not say
 at this time.

 My husband will wish
 to investigate, I'm sure.

  So naturally,
  I'm reticent.

 Yes, I'm reticent.

Of course, Mrs. Shinn,
I understand.

 But you see,
 part of my music plans

   include a committee
   on the dance and...

Wait...

   Now wait, do that again,
   Mrs. Shinn.

Your foot, the way
you raised it just now.

 Well, I have a bunion there
 that bothers me.

Oh, what grace.

 Oh.

  What natural flow
  of rhythm.

 Oh.

  What expression of line
  and movement.

  Oh, you must accept
  the chairmanship

of the Ladies Auxiliary
for the Classic Dance.

 Mustn't she, ladies?

WOMEN: Oh, yes!
You must.

   Oh, every move you make,

 Professor, her kind of woman
 doesn't belong
 on any committee.

 Of course, I shouldn't
 tell you this,

but she advocates
dirty books.

   Dirty books?

  Chaucer.

   Rabelais!

  Balzac.

 <i> â™ª Cheep cheep cheep cheep</i>

I'll tell.

 The man lived on my street,
 let me tell.

  Stop!

   (SINGING STOPS)

  I'll tell.

 She made brazen
 overtures to a man

who never had a friend
in this town
'til she came here.

Old Miser Madison.

 Miser Madison?

   Madison Gymnasium?

  Madison Picnic Park?

  Madison Hospital?

That Miser Madison?

 Exactly. Who did he think
 he was anyway?

 I should say. Showoff.

Gave the town
the library too, didn't he?

 Well, that's just it.

 When he died he left
 the library building
 to the city...

  But he left
  all the books to her.

 She was seen going
 and coming from his place.

  Oh, yes.
  Oh, yes!

  That woman made
  brazen overtures...

(LADIES RESUME SINGING)

 ...with a gilt-edge guarantee.

She had a golden glint
in her eye,

   and a silver voice
   with a counterfeit ring.

 Just melt her down
 and you'll reveal

 a lump of lead
 as cold as steel here,

  where a woman's heart
  should be.

(ALL SHUSHING)

 Mrs. Paroo, do you realize
 you have the facial

 characteristics of
 a cornet virtuoso?

   I don't know if I understand
   you entirely, Professor.

 If your boy has that
 same firm chin,

 those splendid
 cheek muscles, by George.

 Oh, not that he could
 ever be really great,
 you understand.

Oh, is that so?

  And in the name
  of Saint Bridget,
  why not?

   Well, you see,
   all the really great

   cornet players
   were Irish.

 O'Clark, O'Mendez,
 O'Klein.

  But Professor,
  we are Irish.

   No.

  Yes.

No!

   (LAUGHS)

 Well, that clinches it.

 That clinches it.
 Sign here, Mrs. Paroo.

Your boy was born
to play the cornet.

  Oh!

 Fine, fine.

 That'll be $7
 earnest money,

 with nothing more due
 till the first installment

 payable at the opening
 of band practice.

 Thank you.

   Oh, and of course,
   I'll need the boy's
   measurements

 for his band uniform.

His uniform!

 (BOY SCREAMING)

 (GASPS)

 I got ya.

  Hello, son.

 Certainly, certainly
 his uniform.

And there won't be
a penny due until delivery,

 just in time for
 the Fourth of July,

   which gives him
   three weeks to enjoy,

 to anticipate, to imagine,
 at no cost whatever.

  Never allow
  the demands of tomorrow

to interfere
with the pleasures
and excitements of today.

   Would it have a, a...

A stripe? A stripe.
Certainly, my boy.

   A wide red stripe
   on each side.

  What do you think
  of that?

  (DOG BARKING)

  You'll have to excuse
  Winthrop, Professor.

 We can't get him to say
 three words a day, even to us.

And if you can get him
to play in the band,

 you'll have St. Michael's
 own way with you.

  If anybody can do it,
  I'll bet you can.

 I'll pick you

 Oh, why, yes.

   Oh!

   Ooh!

Howdado, Miss Paroo.

Howdado, Mr. Hill.

 Oh, of course. Paroo.

 I thought the name
 sounded familiar.

   He wants to put Winthrop
   in the band.

 We're not interested, Mama.

   But Marian,

 the boy might have
 his father's musical gift.

  He does have
  me jaw, you know.

Oh, your husband
musical?

 Well, I'd like
 to have a talk with him.

   I'm sure
   that we could...

Do you burst in
on everyone's home
like this?

  Prying into
  personal affairs?

  We're not interested.

   Marian!

  Well, that's one for
  and one against.

   Now why not let
   the boy's father decide?

The boy's father is dead.
Anything else?

 Oh, I'm sorry.

   But that's all the more
   reason that your brother

  should have
  something like this.

   My brother
   is an eight-year-old
   problem child

 who can't understand
 why our father was taken away.

   Would you care
   to explain it to him?

 He's been brooding
 about it for two years.

 As to your musical tricks,

 why don't you go into business
 with some nice carnival man

 who sells gold-painted watches
 and glass-diamond rings?

   Musical tricks?

 Well, Miss Paroo,
 I hardly...

   I get the feeling
   she likes the idea.

 Oh, a little cautious perhaps,
 but I admire that in a woman.

 Keep me alive
 and I'll be back
 later in the week.

   Oh!

  (DOG BARKING)

   One moment,
   Professor Hill.

 About the boy's
 measurements,

I make all his clothes,

   sleeve 21, waist 18,

 crotch 14.

 Fine! Fine,
 that's all I need.

 Now, I must get back
 to the hotel.

  Professor, I do hope
  you'll excuse Marian.

She's not really...

 Oh, please. Don't worry
 about a thing.

 I'm sure that at heart
 she's as lovely as yourself.

 Good day to ya,
 Widow Paroo.

  Has he gone?

He has.

And I hope
not forever.

  Darlin', don't you ever think
  about your future?

 Gary, Indiana,
 Conservation Class

   Now darlin'...

 Now Mama,

   surely a girl's future
   doesn't depend
   on encouraging

   every fast-talking,
   self-centered,

 woman-chasing, traveling man
 who comes to town.

 And the fact that
 he claims his commodity
 is music does not,

 in this particular case,
 impress me.

   All right, darlin',
   all right.

 Only it's a well-known
 principle

that if you keep
the flint in one drawer

  and the steel in another,

you'll never strike
much of a fire.

  Mama!

  Winthrop!

Winthrop! I know
you're out there.

  (SIGHS) Winthrop.

   Please go to the post office

 and ask Miss Grubb if a
 package has arrived for me.

It's a book, the <i> Indiana State
 Educational Journal
 1901-1910.</i>

  Do I hafta?

  You won't have to
  talk to anyone.

  I've written it all down.

 Thanks, Win.

 What are you up to?

 What do you need
 with another book?

 I have a feeling
 this book may poke

 some large holes
 in the Professor's claims.

Well, I give up.

 At your age,
 if you don't mind my askin',

 what kinda white knight
 do you expect to come
 ridin' along?

  Well, I'm not waiting
  for Luther Greiner

  who backs me into
  the Ancient History shelf

every time he comes
into the library.

  Oh, he does?

 I can't.
 It's Epworth League night.

  Meet you where?

 The footbridge.

   You see? Isn't that just
   what I said?

  Last time the lumberyard
  and now the footbridge.

Then where will you
meet me after that?

 In the Black Hole of Calcutta?

 Ye Gods.

 I only wanna show you
 my invention.

 What invention?

 My music holder

for a marching
piccolo player.

 It still has a couple
 of minor flaws.

 See, when you keep it
 tight enough
 to hold the music steady,

 you cut off the circulation
 and you can't wiggle
 your fingers.

  Meanwhile,
  you could go blind.

  Shh! It's Miss Paroo.

Miss Paroo.

Oh, I'll be right
with you.

 <i> â™ª And it's your,</i>
 <i> your "Got to go, dear"</i>

   <i> â™ª That gets,</i>
   <i> that gets me down â™ª</i>

 Take your hands
 off my daughter!

  Papa!

 You wild kid, ya!

 Mr. Shinn, your honor.

 Your daughter and I
 are goin' steady
 behind your back.

 Why you!

Well, we'd rather do it
in front a'your back but...

  Do what?

   Well...

   Never mind.

  (GASPS)

 I'm going to warn
 you once more.

 If I ever catch you
 touching my daughter,

 I'll by-God horsewhip you
 'til Hell won't have it again.

 But, George!

 Not one poop
 out'a you, madam!

   He means peep.

Yes!

 And now get off
 the school property.

 I got as much right
 to be here as anybody.

 How do you get
 any right around here?

 Aiding and abetting
 the swindling activities

 of this spellbinding
 cymbal salesman?

   Now, Mr. Mayor,
   if you please...

 I'll settle your hash
 as soon as I get
 these premises

 offa' my oldest girl.

All right, all right,
but in the meantime

 I want you to know
 that I'm vouching
 for Tommy Djilas.

  This boy's got the confidence
  of every kid in town.

 You'll be standing in line
 waiting to shake his hand

   by the time our band
   plays its first concert.

   By the time your band
   plays its first concert,

  the individual members'll
  have to foregather
  in wheelchairs

  on account of the broken legs

 they'll get from tripping
 over their beards.

 You know what I see
 written all over you?

  Reform school!

  Papa, please.

It's Capulets like you make
blood in the market place.

Ye Gods.

   You watch your phraseology,
   young woman.

   You go home
   and stay in your room.

 I'll tell you something,
 my fine young feathered...

 My feathered young...

 Never mind!

 And you, get out of here,
 you wild kid, ya.

  All right, all right,
  Tommy, let me buy you
  a sarsaparilla.

  I hate you.

 Eulalie!

 Now George, I only...

 You tend to your dance.

  But...

  Oh!

 MAYOR:
 I'll handle this my way.

Mr. Mayor, you are
not being fair.

 Now, you stay out
 of this, Miss Paroo.

   And by the way,
   thanks for nothin'.

 I've read that book
 you gave me

 from cover to cover
 for a whole week now,

 and didn't find a thing.

Oliver!

  Jacey! Olin! Ewart!

   I want that man's references
   and I want 'em tonight!

   Don't let him
   out'a your sight.

   He's slipprier'n a
   Mississippi sturgeon!

 Do you mean you want us
 to get his credentials?

 Get his papers
 or get him in jail!

   I couldn't make myself
   any clearer

  if I was a button-hook
  in the well water.

  Come on. Let's go.

Okay.

  Thank you.

 Now you enjoy yourself.

Excuse me.

Hello, Miss Marian.

   Thanks for the sarsaparilla,
   Professor, and the talk.

  Miss Marian.

 Professor Hill,
 I think Mayor Shinn
 has behaved abominably,

 and I just wanted to say

 it was wonderful of you
 coming to Tommy's defense
 back there.

  Oh, that was nothing.

 Oh, yes it was.

   Oh, no, no.

   A man can't dodge
   the issue

 every time a little
 personal risk is involved.

 What does
 the poet say?

 "A coward dies
 a thousand deaths,

"the brave man only

   "500."

  Unfortunately, of course,
  the Mayor was already
  pretty mad at me

   on account of
   his billiard parlor.

Now...

   Oh, I suppose
   a recommendation
   from a musical authority

  such as yourself
  would help but...

 I couldn't think of asking you
 to do a thing like that.

 Why not?

   You mean, you would?

  I'd be glad to.

 I just wish I was
 a little more informed.

 I've been wanting
 to talk to you
 about Winthrop's cornet.

  His cornet?
  Mother-of-pearl keys.

 Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

It's just that
he never touches it.

 Oh, the first week or so,
 he made a few experimental,

 uh, blats,
 I guess you'd say?

   Yes, yes, blats.

 And he sings the <i> Minuet in G</i>
 almost constantly.

 <i> â™ª La de da de</i>
 <i> da de da de da</i>
 <i> La de da â™ª</i>

But he never touches
the cornet.

   Yes, well...

 He says you told him
 it wasn't necessary.

  Well...

 He tells me about some
 "Think System."

 If he thinks
 the <i> Minuet in G,</i>

 he won't have to bother
 with the notes.

 Now, Professor...

 Miss Marian,

 the Think System
 is a revolutionary method,
 I'll admit.

 But, so was Galileo's
 conception of the Heavens,

   Columbus' conception
   of the egg,

uh, globe,

  Bach's conception
  of the Well-Tempered
  Clavichord. Hmm?

  Hmm.

   Oh, now I cannot discuss
   these things here in public,

but if you'll
allow me to call.

  When may I call?

 Why, any night
 this week.

  <i> â™ª Pick a little,</i>
  <i> talk a little,</i>
  <i> pick a little, talk a little</i>

 <i> â™ª Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep,</i>

Oh, Miss Paroo, please join

 You were so dear today
 dancing with Professor Hill.

<i> â™ª You had a golden shimmer

<i> â™ª And silver shoes

 <i> â™ª A forgiving heart</i>

   <i> â™ª The Professor told us</i>

   ALL: Mmm!

 Sorry, Professor,
 but we got our orders.

 We've all been deputized.

  Oh! Oh, well,
  congratulations.

Uh, let's see now,

  you know all week long
  I've been trying

   to give you fellows
   my references
   and credentials,

 but you always seem to get
 off the subject somehow.

   Now I have just what
   you need up in my room.

 Take me a second.

   Sorry. 'Fraid we'll have
   to go along with you.

  Yes, yes, well, let's see
  if I have my key.

  What is this?

Oh!

 Oh, it's a testimonial
 from Madame Rini.

The only female
bassoon player ever

   to appear on
   the Redpath Circuit.

 Her stage name, of course,
 actually, she was from Moline,

 Lida Rose Quackenbush.

   Could I see that
   for a minute?

  Oh, you'll never forget
  the name, Lida Rose,

just like the song.

 Seems like we just took down
 the flags for Flag Day,

 and now we're starting to put
 them up again for
 the Fourth of July.

  I'm starting to see
  red, white, and blue spots
  before my eyes!

every year, Mama,

  but you always
  volunteer to sew.

  Well, it's funny how
  things get to be
  a habit with people.

  You think a person
  might change, but they don't.

 You think a person
 might let herself go,
 might speak her heart,

   but she don't.

 Might tell a fellow
 how she's longing,
 but she don't.

  Mama!

 Will you ever tell him?

 Won't you ever tell him?

 Ah, fiddlesticks, just open
 your mouth, my girl,
 let it come out.

 Now Mama...

 Now nuthin'.

 If he ever comes
 to call again,
 you see him alone

 and if you haven't
 the gumption to tell him
 how you feel...

   Tell him?

 Well, there's nothing wrong
 with a ladylike hint.

  (DOG BARKING)

 Winthrop,
 where've you been?

Fishing.

 Fishing!

 With Harold.

   You mean Professor Hill?

 Mmm-hmm.

And look, I still
have some worms left.

  Ew! Oh, what's that?

  A lucky rabbit's foot,
  he gave it to me.

  Did you have
  a good time?

   Scrumptious. Look, Mom!

   Ugh!

 Scrumptious.

   What did you talk about?

   Stuff.

What stuff?

   He told me all about
   his hometown, Gary, Indiana.

 He said he'd
 take me there someday.

And he taught me
a song, which hardly
has any 's's' in it.

 <i> â™ª Gary, Indiana</i>
 <i> Gary, Indiana</i>
 <i> Gary, Indiana</i>

<i> â™ª Let me say it once again</i>

  <i> â™ª Gary, Indiana</i>
  <i> Gary, Indiana, Gary, Indiana</i>

   <i> â™ª That's the town</i>
   <i> that knew me when</i>

 <i> â™ª If you'd like to have</i>
 <i> a logical explanation</i>

  <i> â™ª How I happened</i>
  <i> on this elegant syncopation</i>

 <i> â™ª I will say without</i>
 <i> a moment of hesitation</i>

 <i> â™ª There is just one place</i>
 <i> that can light my face...</i>

<i> â™ª Gary, Indiana</i>

   <i> â™ª Gary, Indiana</i>

   <i> â™ª Not Louisiana, Paris</i>
   <i> France, New York or Rome</i>

 <i> â™ª But Gary, Indiana</i>

  <i> â™ª Gary, Indiana</i>
  <i> Gary, Indiana</i>
  <i> My home sweet home â™ª</i>

 I'll be back in a minute.

  I have to show Amaryllis
  my new live frog.

 Oh, you're not going
 to the Fourth of July
 sociable in those clothes!

  You make sure you're
  back in time to
  have a bath!

 Okay.

   <i> â™ª La de da de da</i>
   <i> de da de da</i>

   <i> â™ª La de da</i>

<i> â™ª La de da da de
 da de da de da â™ª</i>

  Oh, leave the dishes,
  Mama, I'll do them.

 Aren't you gonna change
 for the sociable?

There's plenty of time.

 Come on, Shadow. Come on.

 MAN: River City!
 River City, station stop.

 River City!

  Say there, old timer,
  you know where I can
  find Elm Street?

 Yeah.

Criminee!

Yes?

   Is this the Shinn residence?

 Oh, the Shinn home
 is on East Elm.
 This is West Elm.

 Aw, criminee, I...

   See you're the piano teacher
   here in town.

Yes.

  My name's Cowell,
  Charlie Cowell,

 anvil salesman.

Oh!

 I guess you know all about
 this Hill fellow, formin'
 a boys' band here in town.

  Yes.

   Well, you don't need
   to worry about
   him no more.

  I got the goods
  on him in spades.

  Swindlin' two-bit
  thimble rigger.

 That's why I gotta
 go see Shinn.

   But...

   Mr. Cowell, wait! Please!

 Ah, sorry, miss, the number
 eight only makes
 15-minute water stop.

 Ooh, I wish it was
 20, though.

 Sure would like to concentrate
 five minutes more
 on you, girly girl.

 But just now I'm out
 to protect the good name

 of the travelin' fraternity
 from that swindler.

Please, Mr. Cowell,
you are making
a big mistake.

 Mistake! Mistake my
 old lady's corset cover!

 That fella's been
 the raspberry seed in my
 wisdom tooth just long enough.

He spoiled Illinois for me,
he's not gonna spoil Iowa!

 What kind of music
 teacher are you, you
 don't see through him?

 He's no more Professor than...

 Oh, I know all about that.

 Band leaders are
 always called Professor.

 It's a harmless deception.

 He's a fine director
 and his scholastic...

 Now just a minute.

 Fine director?

Have you heard even one
note a'music from any band?

  No, but...

   But nothin', girly girl!

He's never formed
a band in his life!

 And he never will!

  If you'll just listen
  to me for a minute.

Oh, I'd like to. I'd like
to do a lot more than that,
if I had the time,

  'cause I sure got
  the inclination.

   But I gotta get back
   on that train and
   deliver this dynamite

 to somebody on the way
 to the depot.

 Bye, girly girl.
 I'll see you
 next time through.

 You'll never make
 that train at the depot.

 You'll have to catch it
 at the crossing.

   No, sir. I've got to
   leave word.

  And I can see you ain't
  the one to leave it with.

 Just a minute,
 Mr. Cowell, you...

 You don't know me yet.

   Is that an invitation?

 I never met a man
 who sells anvils.

  That's something, well...

  Uh, quite different.

 Takes a real salesman,
 I can tell you that much.

 Anvils have a limited
 appeal, you know...

 I... What am I doin'?

 If I miss that train,
 I'm fired!

 I gotta leave word
 about that fellow Hill!

   Leave word with me.

  Not on your tintype.

   How do I know you'd even
   deliver these letters?

 Try me.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

 There's your train,
 you better run for it!

   You double-dealing little...

   Who do you think
   you're protecting?

 That guy's got
 a different girl in
 every county in Illinois,

 and he's taken away
 from every one of 'em!

   And that's
   102 counties!

 That's not counting the little
 piano teachers like you
 that he cozies up to,

 just to keep their
 mouths shut!

 Neither one of you's
 heard the last of me,
 girly girl!

 (MRS. PAROO EXCLAIMS)

Oh, my goodness,
I just remembered, I've got
some jelly on the stove!

There's no jelly
on the stove, Mama.

   Well, I'll just put some on.

 You just come up here and set.

 Shall we "set"
 as your mother said?

   What are you doing here?

 You asked me to call.

Did I? I didn't
mean anything.

 No, no, I wasn't
 suggesting that your
 invitation inferred anything,

 but academic enlightenment,

 the Think System.

 I've been by your house
 to try to explain it to you
 a time or two this week,

 but there always seemed
 to be people around.

 Mostly ladies, I thought.

 Yes, Mrs. Squires
 and several of the ladies.

 I'm glad. Wouldn't want
 anybody beating my time.

  Well, it's evidently
  not the convenient time.

   Professor Hill!

 Is it true that you've
 had 100...

What I'm trying
to say is...

  Yes?

 Is it really true that
 you've developed a...

 A Think System?

   Absolutely.

   It's really very simple,
   as simple as whistling.

No one has to show
you how to use
your lips in whistling.

 You only have to
 think a tune to have
 it come out clearly...

Here.

 Now just try
 this yourself, before
 you ask any questions.

  I take your word.

  (SIGHS)

Would you like to sit down?

 Are all music teachers
 as dense as I am?

All music teachers?

 I daresay you meet dozens...

   Even a hundred.

Well, I...

 Have they all been
 fascinated as I have with...

   The Think System?

  Some more, some less.

  One young lady thought up
  the same system
  before I got to her town.

 She showed me
 a few refinements.

I see.

   Have I said something wrong?

 Please don't let me
 keep you, Professor Hill.

 You must have many more
 important things to do

 than explain the
 Think System to me.

Can't think of one.

 And I must be
 very dull company for
 a man of your experience.

  Now, say, where'd you get
  an idea like that?

  One hears rumors
  of traveling salesmen.

   What have you heard?

 Oh, nothing, nothing about you
 personally, just generally.

 What have you heard generally?

 Just that,

 but of course, it stands to
 reason that disappointment
 and jealousy can lead to,

 to, I mean,
 take you for instance,

 your attention to,
 to, to customers

 and, and, and well, teachers,

 might easily be
 misinterpreted, mightn't they?

 I mean, now honestly,
 mightn't they?

   Why?

 And, so you say,
 if another

 salesman or someone
 were jealous,

   I mean...

 Well, they could be
 downright lies, couldn't they?

What could?

 Rumors and things.

Why, of course.

 It just proves that you
 can't believe everything
 you hear, doesn't it?

I mean...

 If you just
 discuss things.

  Miss Marian, I would be
  delighted to discuss anything
  in the world with you.

 But couldn't we do
 it sitting down?

 You do sit?

  Your knees
  bend and all.

   We could sit
   on the porch steps.

We could also sit
on the large hollow log
over't the footbridge.

 Oh, I couldn't think of it.

  I've never been
  to the footbridge
  with a man in my life.

  Just to talk.

 I just can't, please,
 some other time.

 Maybe tomorrow.

  My dear little librarian,

   pile up enough tomorrows

 and you'll find
 you've collected nothing
 but a lot of empty yesterdays.

 I don't know about you,
 but I'd like to make today
 worth remembering.

So would I.

   Footbridge. In one hour.

 One hour.

  (EXCLAIMS)

  Mama! Mama!

   What?

 I just told Professor Hill
 I'd meet him at the
 footbridge in an hour.

 Glory be and the saints
 be praised. It works!

   What does?

 I've been usin'
 the Think System
 on you from the parlor!

 ZANEETA: Professor Hill!
 We need you for
 the <i> Shipoopi!</i>

 I've been looking
 everywhere! Come on!

 Zaneeta,
 I'll be along shortly.

 No, we've got to hurry!

Everybody's waiting,
and there's gonna
be fireworks.

  Ye Gods, you don't
  want to miss them!

  (ALL CHEERING)

 All right, I'll give it a try!

 Found him!

   What? What am I
   supposed to do?

 We got her!

 Yay!

  All right, watch out!
  Step back!

   The footbridge.

  Five minutes.

 Miss Marian, you're late.

 I came right here.

   No, I meant
   that you were about,

   well, I'd say
   about 26 years late.

   Took you all this time
   to get to the footbridge
   with a fella.

 If you wanna know the truth,
 it almost took longer.

   Oh?

Halfway here,
I nearly turned back.

 I suppose
 I'm not the first to find it
 easier to think clearly

 when not under the spell
 of your salesmanship.

 Now, Miss Marian,
 surely you don't think

  I've been
  selling you anything.

 No. No,
 you've given me something.

That's why
I decided to come.

   Why I don't recall
   giving you anything.

Oh yes, you have.

  Something beautiful.
  That's why I came.

 I'm glad.

 Please don't be afraid that
 I'll expect too much more.

 One can't expect a traveling
 salesman to stay put.

   I know there have been
   many ports of call

 and there will be many more.

   But that's no reason
   for me not to be grateful

for what you will have
left behind for me.

 Marian, I...

 <i> â™ª There were bells</i>
 <i> on the hill</i>

<i> â™ª But I never
 heard them ringing</i>

 <i> â™ª No, I never</i>
 <i> heard them at all</i>

   <i> â™ª Till there was you</i>

 <i> â™ª There were birds in the sky</i>

  <i> â™ª But I never</i>
  <i> saw them winging</i>

 <i> â™ª No, I never saw them at all</i>

<i> â™ª Till there was you</i>

 <i> â™ª And there was music</i>

 <i> â™ª And there were</i>
 <i> wonderful roses</i>

 <i> â™ª They tell me,</i>
 <i> in sweet fragrant meadows</i>

 <i> â™ª Of dawn and dew</i>

 <i> â™ª There was love all around</i>

<i> â™ª But I never
 heard it singing, no</i>

 <i> â™ª I never heard it at all</i>

<i> â™ª Till there was you</i>

   <i> â™ª There was love all around</i>

<i> â™ª But I never heard it</i>

<i> â™ª Singing</i>

<i> â™ª No, I never heard it all</i>

  <i> â™ª Till there was you â™ª</i>

   Marian, there are
   a lot of things
   you don't know about me.

 MARCE: Psst! Hey, Greg!

Excuse me,
I was expecting a cable
from Hector Berlioz.

This could be it.

   Huh.

  (TRAIN WHISTLING IN DISTANCE)

 What?

 Who's the salesman here?

 Looks like she's selling
 and you're buying.

  I have to keep her
  off balance, don't I?

   I told you that.

 Well, she's so far
 off balance now,

 you can't tell her
 from a catboat
 in a hurricane.

 Listen, the band uniforms
 just came in on the train.

 Tommy helped me collect.
 Here's most of the dough.

 The people are gonna be
 screaming for music now,

 so you gotta get out
 of here.

  What time's
  the freight go?

 9:40 from the junction.

Well, it isn't even
8:30 yet.

 Look, you wanna
 turtle-wurtle around here

 and get yourself
 caught up in a bunny-trap,
 you go right ahead.

 Don't worry, Marce.
 I'll meet you at the hotel
 in plenty of time.

Your commission.

  Oh!

  Now, I'll go
  collect mine.


 Never a peaceful moment
 in the music business.

  (MARIAN CHUCKLES)

 Now then, uh,
 where were we?

   You were about to tell me
   what I don't know about you.

 Yeah, well, we don't have
 to go into all that
 just now, do we?

   No, we don't, or ever,
   for that matter, Harold.

 The librarian hasn't
 felt much like
 doing research lately,

  but she did plenty
  when you first came here.

 Oh, about what?

  About Professor
  Harold Hill,

Gary Conservatory
of Music,

   Gold Medal
   Class of aught-five.

   Harold, there wasn't any
   Gary Conservatory
   in aught-five.

   Why there certainly was.

  Because the town
  wasn't even built

  until aught-six.

 You knew all the time?

I tore this page out
of the Indiana Journal.

 It was originally intended
 to use against you,

   but now I give it to you
   with all of my heart.

But if you knew,
why didn't you...


Why you little...

  One Grecian urn!

  Two Grecian urns.

  Oh, that's good.

 And a fountain.

 Ah! Trickle, trickle, trickle,

trickle, trickle,
trickle, trickle, trickle.

 Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

   Listen to this man!

 He has something very
 important to tell all of us.

 You gullible,
 green-grass goats!

 Can't you get it
 through your head
 that you're being

 swindled out'a your eye teeth

   right now, this very minute?

 There's a burglar
 in the bedroom

   while you're fiddling
   in the parlor!

 I'm talking about Harold Hill.

  (CROWD GASPS)

  Road agent. Highwayman.
  Pickpocket.

   Pickpocket?

 CHARLIE: Same thing, oh-ho!

 Oh-ho, same thing.

He's had his hand
in your wallet, mister.

  And yours, madam.

 And yours, little lady.

Ever since the first
moment he came
to this town!

   Why there is more documented
   evidence than you'll
   ever have time to read!

  There isn't any band,

there never
has been any band,

there never
will be any band!

  Winthrop!

 And unless you track
 this man down,

right now, like a mad dog,

there won't be any
Harold Hill either!

Because, he'll be on
the next train outta town.

  (CROWD GASPING
  AND TALKING)

Now you believe me.

So, what are we
waiting for?

   I want my money back!

   Money back? I want his hide!

 After him.
 And when you find him,

   bring him
   to the schoolhouse.
   After him!

  I don't believe any
  of those things he said
  about the Professor.

 Try the low road!
 Look by the creek!

 This is America.
 A man is innocent
 until proven guilty.

  Don't you quote
  the constitutional
  to me, you young pup.

   That fellow doesn't have
   an <i> e plurbis unum</i>
   to stand on!

Try the mill!
Back at the privy!
Follow me.

   (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

 Outta my way.

 (GASPING)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

 (PANTING) You gotta
 get out of here, Greg.

 There's an anvil salesman
 blew you outta the water.

 Uh-oh!

  Everyone in town
  wants a piece of ya.

Hurry!

 Here, go out the back.

 See you
 around the pond.

 Good luck!

(CROWD SHOUTING)

MAN: Upstairs!

  This way!

   Winthrop! What is it?
   What's wrong?

 (SOBBING) I hate him!
 I hate him!

   Who?

The Professor.

  What happened?

 He's a liar.

 Winthrop, tell me
 what happened.

MRS. PAROO: Marian! I can't
find your brother!

He's up here!

   Mother, what happened?

  (WHISTLE BLOWS)

  MRS. PAROO: Winthrop,
  open this door, this second.

   MARIAN: He's probably
   out the window again, Mama.

  (DOG BARKING)

 MAN: Check down
 by the banks!

   Marian, let me in.
   Just for a minute.

   You can't stay.
   You have to get out.

Please go!
Please, Harold,

  they're even
  talking about
  tar and feathers.

 Marian, I had to see you.
 I was writing you a letter.

   It's all right.
   Don't you know that?
   You don't owe me a word.

Not a word.
Now, please, hurry.

I hate you!
I hate you!

Winthrop!

 I hate you, you liar.

   Wait a minute here, son.

 WINTHROP: I'm not
 your son! Leave me go!

 Not till I talk to you
 for a minute.

 I won't listen!
 You wouldn't tell
 the truth anyway.

 I would, too.

 Would not.

Would too!
Tell you anything
you wanna know.

   Can you lead a band?

No.

Are you a big liar?

 Yes.

   Are you a dirty
   rotten crook?

Yes.

  Now, leave me go,
  you big liar!

 What's the matter?
 You wanted
 the truth, didn't you?

 Now I'm bigger'n you
 and you're gonna stand here
 and get it all,

  so you might as well
  quit wiggling.

 Now, there's two things
 you're entitled to know.

 One, you're a wonderful kid.

 I thought so from the first.

 That's why
 I wanted you in the band,
 just so you'd stop

 mopin' around
 feeling sorry
 for yourself.

  What band?

   I always think
   there's a band, kid.

What's the other thing,
I'm entitled to know?

 Well, actually the other thing

isn't any your business
now that I think of it.

 I wish you'd never come
 to River City!

   No, you don't, Winthrop.

  Sister, you believe him?

   I believe everything
   he ever said.

  But he promised us.

   I know what
   he promised us.

  And it all happened
  just like he said.

   The lights and the flags
   and the colors
   and the cymbals.

WINTHROP: Where's all that?

  In the way every kid
  in this town

  walked around here
  the last three weeks,
  and looked and acted.

 Especially you!

  And the parents, too.

 Does Mama wish
 he'd never come
 to River City?

  No.

 WINTHROP: Well you do,
 don't you?

No, Winthrop, I don't.

Now go, please, Harold.

Go on, Professor, hurry up.

 I can't go, Winthrop.

   Why not?

 For the first time in
 my life, I got my foot
 caught in the door.

 <i> â™ª There was love</i>
 <i> all around</i>

<i> â™ª But I never
 heard it singing</i>

<i> â™ª No I never heard
 it at all</i>

  <i> â™ª Till there was you â™ª</i>

   MARCE: Greg!

   Greg, they're here.

 Get out!

 Get out any way you can!

  Go on, Professor.
  Do as he says.

Sorry, Marce.

Let's go.

   MAYOR: As soon as I spoke
   to Charlie Cowell,

   it was oblivious to me that
   something had to be done.

 Which is why I interrupted
 the program when I did.

  Rest assured,
  this snake
  in our bosom

   would have been
   misapprehended
   by this time.

  Yes! And always remember,

fellow River Citizians,
I can only remind you,

 that I did everything
 in my power to prevent

   this dire happening
   from happening.

 What have you done
 to get our money back?

 That Professor collected
 nearly three hundred dollars
 for uniforms, just last night.

 We haven't seen
 any uniforms yet.

 He's slippery. I told you.

  I haven't seen my boy
  since just after supper.

  He's a kidnapper.

   Fine situation here.

  Virtue has triumphed.

   The sword of retribution
   has cut down

 Professor Harold Hill!

And if there are those,
as I have heard,

  who are melting tar
  and collecting feathers,

   I will not say them nay.

   Well, I think there
   ought to be some
   of you who could forget

 our everlasting Iowa
 stubborn chip-on-the-shoulder
 arrogance long enough

 to remember River City
 before Harold Hill arrived.
 Do you remember?

 Well, do you?

Surely some of you
ought to be grateful to him

  for what he has
  brought to River City

and if so, I should think
you would want to admit it.

 You're wasting
 a great deal
 of time here.

 If there's a person
 in this hall who doesn't think

   this man Hill should be
   tarred and feathered,

 let him stand up.

   Come on.

MAN: Go ahead, stand up.

  Eulalie, sit down.

 And the rest of you,
 standin' there like a coat
 of Shropshire sheep,

   have you people
   forgotten how you bought
   expensive uniforms,

technical instruction books
and high-priced
band instruments?

Have you forgotten
the clear understanding
and warrantee

 that your children
 would be taught
 to play in a band?

Well, where's the band?

   Where's the band?

 (GIRLS GIGGLING)

 That's my Barney!

 That tuba's my Barney!

 Just look at him.

 He's so wonderful.

   Thank you.
