(tense music)

[Claire] God damn it,
pass this asshole.

[Ben] It's a double yellow.

The double yellow is
there because the driver...

[Claire] I know what a fuckin'
double yellow line means.

(tense music)

My cell phone has no reception.

(tense music)

Oh my God, what are we
even doing out here?

(tense music)

(tires squealing)

(Ben Sighs)

God damn it.

Tomorrow's 10 years.

So, we're gettin' away.

It's what people do I guess.

(Claire smirks)

No, you know what?

This weekend we'll get
out of our comfort zones,

we'll get some fresh air.

We'll finally open that bottle.

We used to be a great team.

How did we end up here?

So far away from each other.

(tense music)

Look if, if we wanna
change what we have

we have to stop fighting each other.

We have to start fighting
for each other.

(tense music)

Otherwise fuck it.

(tense music)

So what's it gonna be?

(Ben sighs)

(tense music)

(tense music)
(cicadas chirping)

(tense music)
(wheels clattering)

(footsteps approaching)

(Ben sighs)

(birds singing)

(Claire sighs)

(wood splitting)

(logs clattering)

(jacket rustling)

(wood splitting)

(Ben chuckles)

(birds singing)
(Ben gasping)

(logs clattering)
(gentle music)

(Ben sighs)

Hey you.

[Ben] Hey.

Mm, look at you.

You got all sweaty out there.

Yeah?

You like that?

[Claire] A little actually.

Yeah?

(Claire giggles)

Here, I'll take this for you.

(gentle music)

Thanks.

Ready for some wine?

I'm gonna take a quick shower.

(footsteps retreating)

(Claire sighs)

(footsteps approaching)

(gloves thudding)

(glass thuds)

Hey, I'm gonna run to the store.

(keys jingling)

(door slams)

(Ben sighs)

(footsteps retreating)

(typewriter keys clacking)

(typewriter dings)

(crickets chirping)
(people chattering)

(tense music)

(Claire's throat clearing)

What's um, what's goin' on here?

I'm making Tom Collins.

I can see that.

Here, this one's for you.

(glass thuds)

Who are these people?

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

These are my guests.

(ice cubes clinking)
(tense music)

Well, our guests, now.

They are having some car trouble and...

And your wife was generous
enough to give us a ride.

Name's Tyler.

[Ben] Ben.

Excuse me, I need to talk with my wife.

Hm?

Sorry, we'll just be one moment.

(footsteps retreating)

[Claire] Let's be honest.

Great.

[Claire] This.

This what?

[Claire] Us, here alone this weekend?

What about it?

[Claire] We would've
killed each other, come on.

We woulda torn each other to pieces.

We came out with the intention

of not doing that.
Oh my God, intention?

(Claire laughs)

Oh my God!

What did you think was
gonna happen out here?

We're gonna fall back in love?

Huh?

We're gonna snuggle up
on the couch by the fire

and profess how wrong
we've been to each other?

Whatever was gonna happen,

was gonna happen with you and me.

Not you, me, Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

Oh just stop.

(crickets chirping)

Who are these people?

(Claire scoffs)

They're people.

Okay?

When, when's the last time
that you met somebody?

What?

New people?

Interesting people?

Oh.

Oh they're, they're interesting.

Yeah.

They are.

He's, he's a real story teller.

And she (sighs), you know I think

she's a little bit too young for him.

I can see that.

Can you?

[Claire] Yeah, yeah.

He needs a woman, not a little girl.

Oh you know what I notice is that

most men wanna be the
hero or perceived as such.

So maybe they have that...
I know what this is.

(crickets chirping)

Do tell.

You think I don't know you?

You think I haven't seen every
look you've ever given me?

What are you talking about?

Before you left?

[Claire] Before I left what?

Offering me a glass
of wine the way you did.

[Claire] What about it?

(crickets chirping)

You wanted to fuck me.

Oh you're insane.

Am I?

Yeah.

You are.

Do you wanna know what I do want?

A drink.

(Ben scoffs)

We're helping these
people because we can,

and if this situation were reversed,

how lucky would we be to meet

such courteous strangers as us?

(Claire chuckles)

They're staying the night.

Nobody's cell phones have reception.

We know nothing about them!

How could you bring them...

Let's get to know them shall we?

Come.

Have a drink.

You might even have a little fun.

(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

(Ben sighs)

(door sliding)

(crickets chirping)

So uh, you two are havin'
some sort of car trouble?

(owl hooting)
(crickets chirping)

Yeah.

We got a flat tire.

(Ben groans)

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

Where are you two from?

Oh, Lucy's from Santa Fe.

You know, I never been good
at answerin' that question.

I've moved so much.

[Ben] What brought you both out here?

(crickets chirping)

What do you?

I'm an accounts manager.

What did you wanna do?

(crickets chirping)

(Tyler grunts)

(crickets chirping)

Yeah I know it's uh,
horribly depressing (sighs).

Hm.

I had this uh, grand idea of

writing the great American novel.

(crickets chirping)

You still can.

What about you?

What do you uh, do out in Santa Fe?

Oh (laughs).

Uh, I don't do nothin' in Santa Fe.

I was just comin' back from

workin' a crab season up in Alaska.

Oh.

What's that like, out there on the boat?

Man it's uh, it's hell
no doubt about that.

Food you eat's terrible.

Lot of the guys on board the ship,

they been to jail so there's

constantly a fight breakin' out.

[Ben] Have you been in many fights?

(Tyler laughs)

Yeah I've gotten my ass
kicked a few good times.

[Ben] You bein' modest?

(Tyler chuckles)

But, you get on the right boat you can

make some good money which I happened

to do in the last few years.

It's mostly luck though.

You get on an unlucky
boat, you make nothin'.

You know?

Imagine spendin', a few months on

a floating shit hole and
walkin' away with nothin'.

It's no wonder that a lot of
those guys end up in prison.

Yeah.

But for me it was never
really about the money.

It's (laughs), it's strange.

There's something about a rocking

boat that makes me feel stable.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Both my folks died when I was young.

I think I move so much now just to,

keep my mind busy, to not feel alone.

(crickets chirping)

You're out there seein' the world.

Experiencin' things.

Definitely beats workin' in a cubicle.

You're a good guy Ben, I can tell.

(crickets chirping)

You were probably taught
at a young age that

a good life is a safe
and predictable life

and maybe now you're realizing
that that's not true.

You might be worried
that you've nourished

the seeds of complacency and fear

for too long and now the
roots have grown too deep.

(Ben smirks)

Yeah.

Pretty smart.

And so get control.

You know?

Get your hands dirty.

Drive 'em into the dirt.

Rip apart those roots.

Yeah.

We have the choice,

to hunt the demons that haunt our lives.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

We have the choice to
grab them by the throat.

The choice to never loosen our grip.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

The choice to kill that
thing before it kills us.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

You know what that thing
might be for you?

(door sliding)

Why don't you come inside
and make that fire now?

[Ben] Yeah.

(crickets chirping)

(door sliding)

(crickets chirping)

(fire crackling)

[Lucy] I was just upstairs
and I saw your typewriter.

Are you a writer?

(Lucy laughs)

[Ben] No (laughs).

[Claire] Why did you bring it?

Excuse me darling but
I'm talking to our guest.

(Claire scoffs)

[Claire] Excuse me?

(Ben sighs)

Don't excuse me, I just
asked you a question.

Yeah, yes you did.

But out of turn and out of line.

And out of respect, I'm gonna
continue talkin' to Lucy.

(Claire laughs)

Go right ahead.

(footsteps retreating)

What do you do?

Are you goin' to school or?

Yeah I'm, taking classes
to be a hairstylist.

Have you always wanted
to be a hairstylist?

[Lucy] Yeah.

So, you're passionate about it?

Absolutely.

Passionate.

That's great.

Having passion for...

[Claire] What do you
know about passion?

Excuse me?

What, do you know, about passion?

(tense music)

I know it's an amazing
thing to have (sighs),

and if you have it you should do it,

and the people closest to you

should encourage it, not destroy it.

(tense music)

Destroy?

(Claire laughs)

Ask him who bought him
that thing up there.

What is this?

What do you think you are?

Some shining example of someone

that went after their dreams?

My dreams were your dreams.

That's a fucking cop out.

(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

I had my dream.

For a minute, I was right there.

(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

(Claire sighs)

Then I woke up.

(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

(footsteps retreating)

Claire?

(gentle music)

(hands thudding)

(gentle music)

(Ben sighs)

You know what?

This is what we need.

Yeah.

Yeah this will definitely break the ice.

(liquid sloshing)

What are you waiting for
with that God damn thing?

Just, don't push your
selfishness on me.

You know exactly what this is.

I don't.

I bought this on the day
we got married 10 years ago.

(Claire sighs)

We waited this long and we
can at lest wait until we're

not at each others throats to open it.

Yeah well in that case
we'll never fucking open it.

You know you really are

an intolerable...
You're an asshole.

(Ben sighs)

(gentle music)

(footsteps retreating)

(gentle music)

(Claire sighs)
(gentle music)

(Claire sniffles)

Can I do something with your hair?

Sure.

(Claire and Lucy laughing)

(gentle music)

(Claire sighs)

What a day (laughs).

(Claire sniffles)

I wanted to apologize for earlier.

I,

I don't really have an
excuse I'm just sorry.

It's totally fine (laughs).

Man you two can really go at it.

Yeah we can.

(Lucy laughs)

(door sliding)

(crickets chirping)

I'm uh, I'm sorry 'bout
what happened in there.

(crickets chirping)

Claire and I uh,

our marriage isn't in
the best place right now.

It's been hard since the um...

But can you?

(gentle music)

My doctor said that I can.

Uh, we just haven't tried since.

It's a little scary to want
to try after that happens.

You know?

[Lucy] Yeah.

(gentle music)

What?

I think you two are
gonna make it work.

(gentle music)

(crickets chirping)

We used to not be that way.

(crickets chirping)

Used to laugh a lot.

We used to uh...

(crickets chirping)

(Ben sighs)

Maybe we'll get past it, maybe we won't.

(crickets chirping)
(gentle music)

You know that there's this beetle

in the Amazon that once it uh mates,

its entire genetic makeup
changes for the rest of its life?

Hm.

It carries the genes
of its partner forever.

Isn't that crazy?

Yeah, that's pretty far out.

Yeah, I love that idea.

(crickets chirping)

Yeah.

Once I started dating
Lucy, everything changed.

You and Tyler, what about you guys?

You seem like a good fit.

He's um, he's a gentlemen.

Just, not in the way most guys are.

[Claire] What do you mean?

He's nothing but nice to me but,

well a couple weeks ago...

[Claire] Yeah?

We were at a bar.

[Claire] Mm hm.

And this guy bumps into me.

Makes me spill my drink.

It was an accident so.

This guy was just drunk and rude and,

and he told me to fuck off.

(Claire scoffs)

Jerk.

Things escalated.

Tyler this whole time
was in the bathroom,

and when he comes back the guy's gone.

He went back to his friends.

But the rest of the night I could

just see that Tyler
was, watching this guy.

And then he comes to me and says,

meet me outside, we're leaving.

I go outside.

Waiting on the sidewalk
and the guy comes outside.

And right in the doorway.

(tense music)

What the fuck dude?
(horn honking)

(chair legs clattering)
(dramatic music)

(man groans)

(tense music)

(car whizzing)

(footsteps approaching)

(gentle music)

Jesus.

[Lucy] I knew right then.

That he was crazy?

(tense music)

No, that he was never gonna

let anybody hurt me every again.

(tense music)

Yeah.

Thought you said it was an accident?

That was the night I knew I loved him.

(gentle music)

You know I, I never did ask you

what brought you two out here?

We came out here to see somebody.

[Claire] Oh?

Friend or family?

Um, done.

There you go.

Oh.

It's great, thank you.

[Lucy] Do you have anything to eat?

I was gonna make some soup.

Okay.

I'm gonna go freshen up real quick.

Okay.

(footsteps retreating)

Me and Lucy we never um,

we've never had sex.

(crickets chirping)

I know it's strange right?

You can say it.

I know what you're thinkin'.

(Tyler smirks)

It's unusual.

But it was obvious at
first she didn't want to.

And I was fine with that.

I...

(crickets chirping)

She told me she was raped.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

It was like my whole body was
electrocuted with rage man.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Lucy, she's not the kinda girl

that's gonna sleep with somebody easy.

She needs to really like
them to really trust them,

and they hadn't slept
with each other yet.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Then one day she decided
to go up to his hotel room.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

She liked him.

She trusted him.

They were dating.

It was long distance but
she decided to go up there.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Right away she knew something was wrong.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

So she tried to leave
but he wouldn't let her.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Did she tell the police?

She was in shock.

She...

In some twisted fucking way
she thought it was her fault.

Jesus.

Tyler, she needs to tell the police.

The guy's fuckin' scum right?

Yeah fuckin' A.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

She told me his name.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Nowadays you can find just about

anybody if you really want to.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Found out where he lives.

Where he works.

What kind of car he drives.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You know Ben, he doesn't
live very far from here.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You asked earlier what
we were doin' out here.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Wait.

Wait, wait.

What, what are you sayin'
to me right now?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

I'm sayin' Ben, a guy that does

somethin' like that to a woman,

he knows where he's goin'.

I just sent him there a little sooner.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Ben laughs)

Yeah (laughs).

Oh that, that's, that's good (laughs).

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You killed him?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Yeah I killed him.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Ben I...

(door sliding)

Oh, it's freezing out here.

[Tyler] Come here.

(crickets chirping)

Warm me up.

Oh, guess what?

Hm?

Claire's gonna make some soup.

Oh that sounds really good.

[Lucy] Yeah.

[Ben] Yeah?

(crickets chirping)

You okay?

(hand patting)

Yeah.

(crickets chirping)

I'll, I'll be back.

(crickets chirping)

(Lucy laughs)

They're beautiful aren't they?

Yeah.

(footsteps approaching)

I need to talk to you.

Not now.

Yes now.

Right fucking now.

Do you guys need any help?

No, we're fine.

Thank you so much.

We're just gonna put our
feet up for a little bit.

Yeah sure.

Um, you can actually take the
room at the end over there.

Okay.

Yep.

(Claire sighs)

(tense music)

You never fought for me.

(tense music)

What?

The concert.

That guy that elbowed you in the face?

By accident.

Okay maybe the first
time it was an accident

but he did it again and what did I do?

I told him to fuck off.

And then he pushed me.

He pushed me.

(lid clattering)

And what did you do?

Nothing (hands thudding).

We just walked away.

Why didn't you do something?

(crickets chirping)

Why?

Okay I'm sorry.

I am.

If I could go back, I would.

(Ben sighs)

I don't know what I would do to him.

Alright?

But,


but I won't let anyone
hurt you ever again, okay?

(gentle music)

Tyler...

What?

(tense music)

He killed someone.

What?

(tense music)

They came out here to find this guy.

What guy?

What are you talking about?

Lucy told Tyler about this guy

that she was seeing before Tyler and,

and that he raped her.

(tense music)

So, Tyler found the guy
and he lives out here.

They drove out here, found
him and he killed him.

Okay, this, this guy raped Lucy?

Yeah, that's what Tyler said.

Well fuck him then.

What?

[Claire] If this guy raped her then...

He deserves to die?

Is that what you're saying?

Yeah that's exactly
what I'm saying actually.

You don't know what you're
saying because you're drunk.

I'm not drunk and I
do know what I'm saying.

Put your emotions aside for

a minute and let me tell you somethin'.

We're accessories.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

We have knowledge of a crime,

and if we don't share our
knowledge with the police,

then we're essentially
helping the criminal.

Meaning jail.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

We can take 'em in.

(tense music)

We can do this together, you and me!

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Claire sighs)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You've lost your mind, you know that?

Maybe.

But it feels pretty damn good.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

We deliver him and Lucy to the police.

We just bring 'em right
in to the station.

(crickets chirping)

No.

No but, we, we, we need
to get out of here.

We, we should just go.
Mm hm.

Let's go right now.

We'll go to the police sta...

If we do that, they'll
know where we're going,

and they'll run.

I mean think about it.

We don't know if they have a gun.

(crickets chirping)

We don't know how we'll
react if he's cornered.

We don't want unpredictable.

We don't want panic.

What we want is calm and
relaxed and fun and games.

[Claire] Fun and games?

[Ben] Until...

[Claire] Until what?

(gentle music)
(ball rolling)

What's been goin' on
between us has been difficult.

That's an understatement.

Yeah it's been a
fuckin' nightmare lately.

Yep, that's more like it.

And hurtful and, and mean and...

Maybe our time's run out.

Maybe,

I don't want to say it but,

maybe seperating's the
best thing for us.

I don't know.

(Ben sighs)

But you told me that we needed
to get on the same page.

And you're right.

We do.

So do this with me.

We can do this but only
if we do it together.

(Claire sighs)

(tense music)

You really (laughs),

you really think we can do this?

[Ben] Yeah.

I really do.

(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

This looks incredible.

[Lucy] Yeah.

The generosity you
two have given us has...

It's our pleasure.

We're just glad we could help.

(crickets chirping)

Speaking of that uh,

we've been talking it over
and we don't wanna impose

on you any further and
it's really no problem.

We could find a hotel or...
No.

What Claire means is all
the hotels, they're closed.

Closed?

(crickets chirping)

Yeah it's, it's getting
late and you know,

drivin' down that wind-y road,

it's hard enough in broad daylight.

(crickets chirping)

No.

We have plenty of room, right?

You sure?

Yeah, uh huh, of course.
Yeah, course.

And...

(Claire and Ben laughing)

And you know I think
tonight is as good a night

as any to open my bottle,
and we would love to share.

No, we couldn't.

No it's, it's perfect.

The arrival of you two has just,

it's given Claire and I some new ideas.

So, let's enjoy this dinner.

We'll get a good nights sleep and,

tomorrow we'll take you into town.

I insist.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

If you insist.

(tense music)

(crickets chirping)

Good.

(Claire sniffs)

(cutlery clattering)
(tense music)

Tyler's a fisherman.

Hm.

Well that's, interesting work.

It's hard work.

It's cold, cramped.

Food's nothin' like this.

(Claire laughs)

Hm.

Ever since my folks died I just...

Aw, I'm sorry.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Thank you.

It's been a long time now.

(tense music)

I was talking to Ben about this earlier.

My dad died the year I was born

and my mother died when I was 15.

I think I travel and do so much runnin'

around to try to avoid bein' lonely.

And hope that maybe
by accident I'll just

happen to stumble on
the right tracks and,

be in a nice place
surrounded by good people.

Hm.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Sometimes you just gotta
keep moving so you can,

avoid that idle time where
you start to think things

which can easily lead
to getting depressed.

And it always does doesn't it?

Yeah.

You have a really good attitude though.

Leave things up to destiny, you know?

(tense music)

I don't believe in destiny (laughs).

Me neither.

But I am glad that we are here

and that we got picked up by
people as nice as yourselves.

To our kind warm hearted
strangers (laughs).

(Claire sighs)

Cheers to that.
Cheers.

(Claire and Lucy laughing)

[Ben] Nice.

Cheers.

(glasses clinking)

(fire crackling)

That's why when you take the paper,

(paper crinkling)

and twist it...

(footsteps receding)

(crickets chirping)

(paper crinkling)

(fire roaring)

(crickets chirping)

(Tyler sniffs)

(Tyler sighs)

(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

(Tyler grunts)

(water splashing)

(Tyler sighs)

Oh, um.

(Claire laughs)

(gentle music)

(Claire laughs)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(tense music)
(footsteps approaching)

(hand patting)

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

(hand patting)

(footsteps retreating)
(tense music)

[Ben] What the hell was that?

What?

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

Claire?

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

Why didn't you tell me
that he lost his parents?

Would it matter?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

In case you forgot he killed someone.

How?

How did he do it?

Did he say?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You don't think he did it do you?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

I don't know.

And neither do you by the way.

(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

(Tyler sighs)

(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

Hey?

Come here.

(footsteps approaching)

Do you really think that we can do this?

Yes, God damn it.

Okay.

[Ben] Alright?

Here's what I think we should do.

(Claire whispering)

(tense music)

[Ben] Are you with me?

[Claire] Yeah.

(glasses thudding)

(cork popping)

I guess this is where I'm supposed

to say something profound and witty.

(liquid pouring)

I guess this is where
I tell you the truth.

(liquid pouring)

These last 10 years,

there have been days that I thought,

maybe we'd made a mistake,

and that we'd be happier
with someone else.

(gentle music)

Most days, most days I love
you more than you'll ever know.

Days where I can't imagine
livin' without you.

(Ben sighs)

Can we listen to each other and talk

to each other like
civilized human beings?

Could we...

Can we make a baby?

(crickets chirping)

Yeah.

Yeah we, we can make a baby.

(Ben chuckles)

Yeah (laughs).

(glass thuds)

Okay, go ahead.

(hand slaps)

Fuck you.

(Ben sighs)

(footsteps retreating)

Wait.

(footsteps retreating)

(footsteps approaching)

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I'll live.

(Lucy laughs)

(liquid pouring)

(glass thuds)

Alright.

For you and for her.

This is, probably not the
way you pictured enjoying this.

Yeah, you're right
about that (laughs).

(Ben chuckles)

(footsteps retreating)

(glass thudding)
(tense music)

(liquid pouring)

(glasses thudding)

(tense music)
(paper rustling)

(liquid pouring)

(tense music)

[Tyler] That wouldn't happen
to be for me now would it?

(tense music)

(ice cubes clinking)

(tense music)

Damn.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Yeah.

(Ben sniffs)

Come on, let's go downstairs.

There's a pool table.

(hand patting)

(tense music)

How 'bout another one?

(bottle thuds)

(crickets chirping)

(Tyler sighs)

(crickets chirping)

(balls breaking)

(Claire sighs)

Sounds like they're
havin' a good time.

Do you wanna talk about it?

Not really (laughs).

(crickets chirping)

Do you want to tell me why you

and Tyler really came
out here this weekend?

What do you mean?

I mean we've been more
than generous and helpful.

The ride, the dinner.

Now you're drinking 35 year old scotch.

(crickets chirping)

Least you can do is not lie to me.

(crickets chirping)

(bed creaks)

(crickets chirping)

It wasn't my idea to come here.

(bed creaking)

But isn't that the way
life goes sometimes?

Taking you to places you
thought you'd never go,

and to places you can never forget.

(crickets chirping)

Tyler, Tyler came out
of nowhere for me and,

he came at a time when
I really needed help.

(ball bangs)

(tense music)

I can only assume that you

told your wife so now she knows.

No, not probably.

I definitely shouldn't have
told you that Ben but I did.

But I guess what I'm
getting at right now

is that I really painted
myself in a corner here.

(tense music)

(Tyler sighs)

(tense music)

So what I'm tryin' to say is you know,

(tense music)

I probably shouldn't have done that.

(tense music)

(glass thuds)

I was uh, seeing somebody
before Tyler.

Someone in secret.

He was older than me.

You know he could come
to town on business two,

three times a month.

We saw each other pretty regularly.

(crickets chirping)

I liked him.

He was funny.

And funny's just such a
good quality in a guy.

Yeah.

We'd go out to dinners and the movies.

But we never slept
together in three months.

Oh.

Not that I didn't want to, I did.

(crickets chirping)

And then one night I go
up to his hotel room,

like I'd done 15 times before.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

He'd been drinking, which
he'd never done around me.

You know I, I never saw him like that.

I mean he'd get soda when
we'd go out to dinner.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

He told me he liked me.

I told him I liked him.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

He wanted to have sex, and I didn't.

You know not, not like that
and not, I told him that.

I said, not like this
meaning you're drunk.

He didn't like that very much which,

pissed me off because,

you know he wants to
sleep with me and I don't.

You know fuck him.

It takes two you know?

So I got up, and as soon as I did,

I could feel the whole room change.

The energy.

I can't really describe it but,

I could feel it.

(tense music)

He got up.

Hit me.

Hard.

Kinda knocked me out
for a second or two and,

(tense music)

that's all it took.

(tense music)

He was on top of me
and then it was over.

(tense music)

[Claire] I'm so sorry.

(tense music)

There's so many feelings that

go through you when
you're violated like that.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Confusion.

Shame.

And then a deep sadness.

Anger and rage.

I told, I told Tyler all of this and,

right away I saw a fire in his eyes.

(tense music)

Couple days later...

(tense music)

That's him.

(door slams)

(tense music)

(door unlatching)

Wait, what the hell is that?

It's just to scare him.

It's not even loaded.

(tense music)

(door slams)

(tense music)

(bat whacking)
(tense music)

(shot firing)

(tense music)

What was that shot?

What happened?

(Tyler sniffs)

You said it wasn't loaded.

What did it hit?

It didn't hit, it didn't...

What did the bullet hit Tyler?

It didn't hit anything.

(Tyler sniffs)

What about him?

(Tyler sniffs)

He got what he deserved.

(engine starting)

(tense music)

Hey, are you okay?

(engine revving)
(tense music)

Tyler, talk to me.

(engine revving)
(tense music)

What's wrong?

(tense music)

(Lucy scoffs)

(tense music)

(tire blows)
(Lucy gasps)

(tire rattling)

[Tyler] No, no, no.

No, no, no.

Wait, what the?

(door unlatching)

(Tyler sniffs)

(door slams)

(tense music)
(birds chirping)

Yeah, tire blew up.

(tense music)
(birds singing)

No spare.

(tense music)
(birds singing)

[Lucy] What do we do?

(Tyler gasping)

(tense music)

We gotta go.

We gotta, we gotta walk.

(Tyler sniffs)

Come on.

(tense music)

Yeah.

(door slams)

Come on.

(tense music)

Let's go.

(tense music)
(birds chirping)

(branches rustling)

(tense music)

(gravel crunching)

[Claire] Hey are you guys okay?

Do you need a ride or somethin'?

Um, yeah that'd be great actually.

[Claire] Come on in, yeah.

I can take you into town.

(door unlatching)

(door slams)

[Lucy] Thank you.

[Claire] Yeah, no problem.

(door slams)

(engine revving)
(tense music)

(crickets chirping)

And then you came to our rescue.

(crickets chirping)

(Tyler exhales)

(tense music)

Doin' alright there?

(tense music)

(Tyler exhaling

You know, what kinda man would I be,

knowin' that uh I had a murderer

in my house and I just let him go?

(cue stick clatters)

(tense music)

(Tyler grunts)

How could I look at myself in

the mirror and not see a coward?

(Tyler grunts)
(tense music)

(Tyler thuds)

(tense music)

What was that?

(ice cubes clinking)

Listen, what you went through,
it was, it was terrible.

It was unforgivable okay?

Yeah, but I don't even want to,

I mean I shouldn't have told you.

I just thought that as a
woman you might understand.

I do, I do understand okay?

And, and if I were in your shoes

I don't know what I would do but,

what you're talking
about right now and what,

what Tyler told Ben...

What?

Tyler told Ben that he's dead.

We can't...

You knew this whole time?

Listen to me, this is very serious.

Okay?

And I, I know what wanting
revenge feels like.

I do and I, and I know that
when you're that angry you,

you wanna rip somebody's eyes out and,

and you want to hurt them but we can't,

we need your help right now.

Okay?

I know...

Let go of me.

Tyler?

Tyler can't hear you right now.

What do you mean?

I get that you might want to kill

the man that did that to you, okay?

Because you feel that he
deserves it and maybe does but...

But what?

(tense music)

(Lucy scoffs)

Tyler?

(footsteps retreating)

Tyler?

(Claire sighs)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Claire sighs)

(footsteps retreating)

(ties rustling)

(footsteps approaching)

(Lucy gasps)

(tense music)
(footsteps approaching)

(Ben sighs)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(footsteps approaching)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Lucy sobbing)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Alright.

We'll wait 'til the
sun comes up before...

[Claire] Before what exactly?

She didn't know.

What?

[Claire] She didn't know
what Tyler was going to do.

That's bullshit.

No, she's not a part of this.

I thought we were so lucky

when Claire pulled up next to us.

Lucy, please sit.

Just, let us explain for a minute.

(crickets chirping)

Okay what you went through
was hell, no question.

But you came out on the other
side and there's hope in that.

(crickets chirping)

And if you wanna hold on to that hope,

you need to help us.

Which in turn will help you.

What do you mean?

We need to take Tyler to the police

and you need to tell them what happened.

That, you told Tyler
what that man did to you

and that you didn't know what
Tyler was gonna do to him.

That's true isn't it?

That you didn't know what
Tyler was going to do?

Because if he is dead...

And if you were a part
of it in any way,

that makes you an accomplice to a crime.

What Ben's talking about is jail.

You don't want to go to jail.

I don't, we don't want you to go to jail

for something that Tyler
did on his own accord.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

What Tyler did?

Tyler defended me.

He avenged me.
No.

Yes.

[Claire] Okay maybe in a way but...

[Ben] What Tyler did
was commit murder.

Call it revenge or vengeance
but what it isn't is justified.

What about the death penalty?

[Ben] What about the death penalty?

The death penalty is justice?

[Ben] The death
penalty's used very rarely

in this country and when it is...

So what we're talking about

is whether murder is a
justified punishment for rape?

And you, you obviously
don't think it is.

(Lucy scoffs)

No, I don't.

And the reason you don't is

because you've never experienced it.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

If you had you'd, you'd have
a different perspective.

What you're talking
about is vigilante justice.

Taking the law into your own
hand however you see fit,

that's not the way it works.

[Claire] You didn't know
what Tyler was gonna do.

You won't get into any trouble that way.

Is that true?

(tense music)

Lucy?

I didn't know what he was gonna do.

[Ben] But you were there?

Yes.

Look, I know there's a part of you

that thinks what he did was heroic,

but what he did was put your life

and his life on the line.

There's no getting away from this.

And I think you know that or else

you wouldn't have told Claire.

(tense music)

That's the feeling of
guilt inside of you.

(tense music)

Lucy, this is the right thing to do.

But we need to take control
now before we can't anymore.

Do you understand?

[Claire] What we're
asking is are you with us?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

I wanna do what's right.

Good.

Alright, we need to get Tyler...

(metal whacks)

(Ben thuds)

[Claire] Ben?

(tense music)

(shoe whacks)

(tense music)

(crickets chirping)

(tense music)

(Ben gasping)

Claire!

(Ben gasping)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

You look like a badass warrior.

(crickets chirping)

Wait.

(crickets chirping)

(metal clanging)

(Tyler sighs)

Yeah.

You remember this guy?

Ah, you probably don't.

Hold still.

(metal clunks)

(Ben groans)

There.

You know you were out for awhile.

(crickets chirping)

(chair scraping)

Lucy had to make sure
you will still breathing.

(Tyler sniffs)

You should be thanking me.

(tense music)

At any moment I coulda tippy
toed into that kitchen,

pulled out a knife and slit your throat.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

But I didn't do that.

(crickets chirping)

Where's Claire?

[Tyler] Claire's fine.

She's downstairs havin' a
little chit chat with Lucy.

I thought you and I could take

a moment to have a man to man,

that way we could see eye to eye.

(tense music)

That's very important to me Ben.

(crickets chirping)

[Ben] What is?

That you understand.

That you empathize with me, man!

'Cause truth be told I don't want

to have to kill you and your wife.

I really honestly don't,

but in order for me not
to do that I need to know.

I need to be convinced.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

I need to be convinced wholeheartedly

that you won't go to the police,

or try and be stupid like think
you can overpower me again.

(tense music)

So, in order for me to
believe that my life

will continue to go on
and not in a jail cell

but out here (sniffs) breathin'
the fresh airs of freedom,

I'm an, I (grunts), I'm an optimist.

I'm generally a very
positive person Ben.

What I'm tryin' to say is uh, you and I,

we need to align like the
rails on a railroad track.

Like, like two people
playing the same instrument

playing the same God damn song.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Okay.

Okay.

(Tyler sniffs)

Good.

(Tyler sniffs)

(Tyler gasping)

That's how you tie a knot by the way.

Oh.

You learn that on the boat?

Mm hm.

Come to think of it I think

I used the same knots
on Claire downstairs.

(tense music)

Claire!

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

What is this?

What do you two want?

Just leave.

We will soon.

But considering our car...

Just take our car.

(crickets chirping)

We talked about that but,

before we do that we have
a few things to figure out.

What do you have to figure out?

(crickets chirping)

What we're gonna do with you two.

(tense music)

(Tyler inhales)

(Tyler exhales)

(Ben gasps)

You know I'm sure you can appreciate

this current situation we're in.

Just a quick refresher, it was
you that tried to poison me.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

I was just tryin' to stop you.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

From what?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Getting away with what you did.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

What I did was try to rid
the world of somethin' evil.

Ben, you want to punish me for that?

(crickets chirping)

Just leave.

Take our car.

Just go.

(crickets chirping)

That's a great idea.

We'll take your car and we'll go.

Yeah.

And then as soon as we leave you'll trot

on over to the nearest phone,

call the police and pretty soon

we'll have choppers on top of
us and cop cars all around us.

That's a fucking stupid idea man.

No, what we're gonna do is you and me

are going to come to an understanding.

You and me...
I understand!

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

I just (sighs), I can never do it.

(crickets chirping)

I'm not like you.

I could never,

I could never do...
Oh

Yes you could.

(Tyler sniffs)

No.

Yes you could Ben.

No.

Yes you could.

No.

Yes you could Ben.
No!

I could never kill anyone!

You have no idea what kind

of darkness you have inside of you.

Everyone of us has something burning

inside of us that wants to come out.

Look at it, it's comin'
out of you right now.

Don't you feel it?

Don't you feel your fingers squeezing?

Wanting to wrap...

[Ben] No!

Wrap themselves around my neck?

Act like you wouldn't right now.

I'm not you.

What do you think you are?

Some kinda saint?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

No Ben.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

What do you want?

I want you to admit
that you would do...

I'm not admitting anything.

What you did, you regret it.

You regret what you did
and you feel remorse.

Maybe, maybe you were hopin'
I would console you and,

and tell you Tyler, hey, it's okay man.

He was a bad guy.

He deserved to die.

But, that's not what I think.

What do you want me to say?

I mean what can you say?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Tyler laughs)

I get it (laughs).

I get it Ben.

I get it.

Whew!

This entire time I've been
tryin' to get through to you,

to get through to you with words.

Ben, I know why we're failing.

Words lie.

Isn't that right?

(tense music)

Don't do this.

I, I can see that what's
happening, it's not you.

But I need your help.

Okay?

To put an end to this.

To be reasonable.

This is...

Reason?

Is that what you're talking about?

(footsteps approaching)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(footsteps approaching)
(tense music)

There's nothing higher
than reason Claire.

Tyler please, stop this.

Mm.

Not yet.

(tense music)

We're close though.

(tense music)

I need you to come upstairs with me.

(tense music)

(footsteps retreating)
(tense music)

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

(Ben sighs)

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(Tyler whistling)

Hey Skip.

We got a plan, we're
gonna take your car.

Good.

Just go.

(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

Um, you won't call the police on us?

(crickets chirping)

You won't?

No, I won't call the police.
You won't?

You pinky promise?

Oh that's right (laughs).

Well, Ben, I don't believe you.

(crickets chirping)

Okay.

Yeah.

I think I'm gonna give
this one more shot.

You know us bein' opposed
in our ways of thinkin'?

I'm gonna try to get
to you one more time.

(crickets chirping)

(footsteps approaching)

(Tyler humming)

Be right back.

(footsteps receding)

(crickets chirping)

Please untie me Lucy.

(crickets chirping)

(Ben sighs)

Don't, just, don't let this happen.

(crickets chirping)

Don't, I know you know this isn't right.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Please.

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

Alright let's get started shall we?

No.

This is insane.

Okay?

Have you lost your mind?

You think by doing this, he will be more

willing to let us go?
Lucy, sometimes

people need to be
motivated in other ways.

Motivated to do what?

Kill you?

Is that what you want?

What do you want?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

The shot you heard?

What about it?

(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

(door unlatching)

Wait, what the hell is that?

It's just to scare him.

It's not even loaded.

(tense music)

(door slams)

(tense music)

(trunk unlatching)

(footsteps approaching)

(tense music)

(balloon pops)

(shot firing)

(somber music)

(tense music)

Wait no.

Let's go, right now.

I'm going through with this.

Why?

(tense music)

It's justice.

(tense music)

(Ben thudding)
(Ben exclaims)

(tense music)

[Claire] Please (sobs).

Don't do this.

If you got a problem just
deal with me, not with her.

(tense music)

I'm ready when you are.

You're not gonna get away with this!

You sick fuck (grunts)!

(tense music)

[Claire] Please just,
please Tyler just let me go.

Come on you can, you fucker, let me go!

Untie me right now!

(tense music)

Please Tyler, just stop.

I'm a gentlemen, I'll
turn down the lights.

[Claire] No.

(Claire sobs)

(tape tearing)

(Ben grunting)

[Ben] Claire!

Don't touch her!

You're gonna pay for
this you know that?

You're going to hell.

(Claire mumbling)

Hey.

Hi, are you okay?

Yeah um, could I get a ride actually?

Come on in.

You can sit in the front.

That's okay I'll just sit in the back.

(door unlatching)

Thank you so much.

[Blonde Woman] Yeah.

Where you goin'?

[Lucy] Anywhere.

(gentle music)

Thank you.

[Ben] Yeah.
