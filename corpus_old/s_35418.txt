I got a business to run right here.
Back.

Yo. Maurice!

Jackie! Jack!

Jackie! Jack! How you doing?

And Miss lovely Amber Waves.

I'm pissed you haven't been around.

We were on vacation.

Don't you ever stay away that long
from my club again.

And not for nothing, honey, but...

You are the sexiest bitch
in the entire country!

I love you!

You're such a charmer.

I got your booth set up.
I'll send some clams over.

Jack. I'm ready. I'm available.

Put me in a movie, okay? We're
talking box office! Box office!

Chi-Chi. Jack and Amber's table,
take them a order of clams.

Let's go! Vamos!

How's it going here?

Baby, me and you...

we'll take a picture later on.
I love you, baby.

We were looking for you before!
Where were you?

I was here.
Seriously, man!

I love you, Beck!

Cowboy!

That's a cowboy?

You like it? It's nice, right?

If you like it.
I love it, man. I love it!

Compliments of Maurice.

Can I get a Margarita, please?

7-Up.

Hi, Rollergirl.

Did you call that girl today?

I forgot.

After tomorrow, it'll be the weekend

and you'll never
be able to see her.

What's the matter down there?

I got to pee.

Well, go then.

What's happening?
I got to pee!

Hey, Jack.
Little Bill.

Amber, how are you?

How's our schedule? Are we still on
for day after tomorrow?

The day after
the day after tomorrow.

Jack, I got to call
Rocky and Scotty, Kurt.

Small crew on this one,
you know what I mean?

A low-key deal?

Exactly.

I'm sorry.

Do we have a script?

How you doing?
Fine.

How old are you?

I have a work permit.

No, it's nothing like that.

Worked here long?

A month.

Maurice give you the job?

Yeah.

You from around here?
I mean, Canoga? Reseda?

No. You know where Torrance is?

How do you get here?

I take the bus.

What do you want to be?

Excuse me?

You take the bus from Torrance to
Reseda to do this job.

Can't you get a job in Torrance?

Yeah, but I don't want to.

So, you want 5 or 10?

What?

If you just want to see me
jack-off, it's 10.

If you just want to look at it,
it's only 5.

Guys pay you to watch you?

You done it tonight?

Couple of times.

You can do it again?

If you want. If you got 10 bucks.

My name is Jack.

Eddie. Eddie Adams.

Eddie Adams from Torrance.

Jack Horner. Filmmaker.

Really?
Yeah. I make...

Adult films. Exotic pictures.

I know who you are. I read about
you in a magazine.

Inside Amber. Amanda's Ride. Right?

Right.

So now you know I'm not
full of doggy doo-doo.

Want t come to the table
and have a drink?

I'd love to, but I got to work.

You have to work, get money,
pay the rent.

Yeah. I mean, no.

I need money, but I don't pay rent.

I live at home.

How old are you, Eddie?

I'm 17.

17-year-old piece of gold.

Yeah, right.

Come. I got people
I'd like you to meet.

I do know who you are.

I'd love to come for a drink.
Obviously you're not full of...

Doggy doo-doo.

But I couldn't walk out on Maurice.
I'm sorry.

Under those jeans something
wonderful's waiting to get out.

Bye, Maurice.

Good night.

Listen, thank you.

Love you. Take care.

This is the man you let in anytime.
You understand?

Fix you some eggs, beauty?

No, I'm going to sleep. Good night.

Good night, honey-tits.

Stay beautiful.

Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

I know that it's late, but...

Is Andy there? Is he?

I'd like to say hello to my son
and that's all.

Let me tell you something, Tom.

I know a lawyer. You understand?

You might think I don't, but I do
and I'll take you to court!

Tom, don't. Come on. Tom, please.
Please.

What the fuck are you doing?

What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

Close the door?

Will I close the door?

Will I close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Get out.

Go sleep on the couch.

Don't stop. Big Stud.

Jesus, please! Shave if you're
going to do that.

You scratch my face.

Sorry.

Morning.

How's it at work?

You get home late?

You work in a nightclub.

If it means so much to you, you
should find one that's closer.

I've got to get to work.

At a car wash.

What?
You work at a car wash.

You work at a nightclub.
School never occurred to you?

Bye, Dad.

Goodbye.

Basically you're getting twice
the bass...

with the TK241, which we've...

got available in this system.

I don't know. I don't really know
if I need all that bass.

I think you need all that bass.

If you want a system to handle
what you want...

you need the bass.

This is hi-fi.

High fidelity.

That means this is the
highest quality fidelity.

Hi-fi. Two important things
to have in a stereo system.

It's the price.

I have this unit in my home.

Really?
Yes, I do.

But, of course, I got it modified
with the TK421.

Which kicks it up another...

3 or 4...

quads per channel, you know?

But that's technical talk.
That doesn't concern you.

You're still a little uncertain.

You know what you need?
A test drive.

You need a test drive.

It's one thing to hear it
from Buck's mouth.

It's another thing to hear it
from the TK421.

Let me pop in this 8-track.

Listen, and tell me what you think.

Hear that?

You hear the bass. Right?

You hear it? It kicks!

It turns! It curls up your belly.

It makes you wanna
freaky-deaky, right?

Now if you get the system as is...

it won't sound like this without
the TK421 modification.

And we do that in the store right
here. Very small price.

Move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

Thank you for your time.

Well, so long, partner.

What the fuck was that?

Have I told you? Have I?
What?

You put on a country-western shit,
no one'll buy a stereo.

What kind of brother listens
to that shit?

Look, Jerry...

No, no, no. You look.

I gave you a job because...

I thought your acting stuff
might bring nice pussy in.

And it has. But I can't have
anymore fuck-ups.

You dig?

You dig?

Yeah, I dig.

Now get in the back and
unload those new 484's.

All right. Sorry.

Settle down, class.

This is your final.

Keep your test papers facedown
until I tell you to turn them up.

Clear your tables, please.

There should be nothing on your desk
but the test and a pencil.

We're covering
chapters 17 through 28.

Your eyes should stay on
your test papers, please.

Are we ready?

Class, begin.

I love to suck cock.
I love to suck cock.

Honey? You okay?

Sweetheart?

Is something wrong?

I got to get back.

I need it again.

I have to go to work.

Come on, give it to me.

Don't make me pounce you.

I'll do it.

You promise?

That's it.

You want it?

How bad?

Bad.

You sure?

You asked for it!

God. wait.

Stop!

What?

Your cock is so beautiful.

Do you know how good you are
doing it, Eddie?

Having sex? Fucking me?
Making love to me?

Everyone has one thing.

Everyone's given one
special thing, right?

That's right.

Everyone's blessed with
one special thing.

I want you to know
I plan on being a star.

A big bring shining star.

That's what I want.
That's what I'm going to get.

I know.

I got to go.

You're lucky.

You want a ride?

You want a ride?

I'm going really far.

Do you remember me from
a couple hours ago?

Yeah, I remember.

Come with us, sweetie.

This is a really cool car.

What I'm trying to tell you...

is that it takes a lot...

of the good American old green stuff

to make one of
these things, you know?

You've got your camera,
you've got your film...

You got your lights, your sound,
your lab costs...

you got devloping, your synching,
your editing.

Before you turn around...

you've spent maybe 20, 25, 30
thousand dollars on a movie.

That's a lot.

You bet your ass it is.

But if you make a good one...

there's practically no end to
how much money you can make.

Have you seen Jack's house?

He will.

He'll see it.

You got maybe 15, 20 guys standing
around just...

making sure that your
lighting is right.

But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon, at night.

It doesn't matter.

If you don't have those juices
flowing in the Mr. Torpedo area...

in the Fun Zone.

But you must get people
in the theater.

You need the big dicks,
the big tits...

Here we go.

How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

With beauty...

and with acting.

I understand you've got to
get them in the theater...

keep the seats full.

But I don't want to make a film...

where they sit down, jack-off...

and they get up and get out
before the story ends.

It is my dream, it is my goal...

it is my idea to make a film...

that the story just sucks them in...

and when they spurt out
that joy-juice,

they just got to sit in it.

They can't move...

until they find out how
the story ends.

I want to make a film like that.

I understand they have to make
films, I've made them myself...

that are a few laughs...

everybody fucks their brains out.
And that's fine.

But it's my dream...

to make a film...

that is true...

and right...

and dramatic.

You want a Fresca?

No thanks.

Are you sure?
You're out of limes, Jack.

Check in the kitchen, darling.

I'm going to bed.

Good night, Jackie.
Don't stay up too late.

Good night, beauty.

Good night, Eddie.

Glad you came by.

You're great.

Thank you.

She's the best.

She's a wonderful mother.

She's a mother to all
those who need love.

She's really nice.

You know what I'm thinking?

I want to be in business with you.

Really?

What do you think?

I'd love it.

What do you think of Rollergirl?

She's great.

Would you like to do it?

Have sex?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'd love to.

She's really foxy.

You bet your ass it is.

You're officially out of limes.

I'll pick up some
for you tomorrow.

Come here, darling.

I want you to get over there and
sit on the couch with Eddie.

Here we go. Are we going to fuck?

Oh, yes.

Wait a minute.

Are you ready?
Yeah, are you?

You taking your skates off?.

I don't take my skates off.

And don't fucking come in me.

Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

Hi.

Where were you?

Nowhere.

Where were you?

You see that little slut-girl?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

Don't say that.

Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

Is she your girlfriend?

No, she's not...

She's a whore and a piece of trash.

I know you're not
the only one she sees.

Why would you say that?

I heard things about that girl.

I know what goes on
when I'm not here!

I wash your sheets.

Or you doing something else in there
with your music and your posters?

What is your problem?

Go to that little whore. Sheryl
Lynn. Go to your little girlfriend.

Maybe I will!

What will you do?

Something!

You can't do anything!

You're a loser!
You'll always be a loser!

You were too stupid to finish
high school! What'll you do?

I'll go somewhere! Maybe I'll run
away where you can never find me!

Fine! Fuck that girl!

What are you doing?

I'm getting my stuff.

That's not your stuff!.
You didn't pay for it!

That is not your stuff!.
You didn't pay for it, stupid!

None of this is yours!

You leave here, you leave
with what you've got!

Nothing! Nothing!

You understand me?

You want to treat me like this?
Is that fair?

I didn't do anything!

Fuck that little whore!

You think you're going to be this...

goddamn poster?! You won't be this!

Don't do that!

Why are you doing that?

You won't be shit!
You're too stupid!

I'm not!

Please, don't fucking do that!
Don't be mean to me!

I am not being mean to you!

You're too stupid to see it!

You don't know what I can do
or what I'm going to be!

I have good things that
you don't know about!

I'm going to be something!
Don't tell me I'm not!

Don't be mean! And you don't talk
to me! No!

Fuck! Shit.

Eddie Adams from Torrance.

I knew you'd make it.

You take the bus here?
It wasn't bad.

How are you?
Great.

I got people I want you to meet.

Do you like music?
I love music.

What kind?

All kinds. Rock, jazz, classical.

I want you to meet
some great people.

Buck and Becky.

Hi, I'm Eddie Adams.
Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.

Our new fella.

Becky Barnett.

Nice to meet you.

This is the new fella?

Is that a faccia?
That is a faccia.

Faccia's "face"?
That's right.

Nice to meet you. Take care.

Great people.

He's one hell of an actor.

I want you to meet the
new boy on the street.

Hi, Eddie. Reed Rothchild.

Stick around for a while, okay?

Sure.

Make him something special.

You live on the street?

I thought Jack just said you did.

Want a drink?

Margarita?

Two...

four, whatever.

Can I ask you something?

Do you work out?

You look like it.

What do you squat.

About two.

Super, super.

What about you?

What do you squat?

350.

No BS.

That's a lot.

Where do you work out?

In Torrance, where I live.

Cool. Cool.

You ever go to Vince's out here?

Oh, no. I would've seen you.

I'm there everyday.

Always wanted to work out
at Vince's.

Cool. Here.
Taste that.

Rock and roll!

Did you see Star Wars?

About 4 times.

People tell me I look like
Han Solo.

Really?

What do you bench?

You tell first.

I asked you first.

Same time.

Cool.

Are you ready?

One...two...three.

You didn't say anything.

Neither did you.

Hey guys, look at me.

Thank you, Johnny.

My dear, it's party time.

You do look lovely.

Hello, Colonel. How are you?

Oh hello, Jack.

This is my lady friend.

Darling, meet Jack Horner.

The finest director in the business.

Do you nave any coke at this party?

I'm sure they can
find some somewhere.

Great.

You're no bigger than a minute.

And shy as a butterfly.
I'll bet.

He has a right to tell me how to
sell stereos. It's his store.

But he doesn't have the right
to tell me how to dress.

Baby, it's just plain old.

Let me tell you something.

First, he was pissed
about the music.

What's wrong with it?

And the cowboy look
ended 6 years ago.

It's coming back.
No, it's not. It's over. It's dead.

You don't know.

I do. And it sounds like
your bosses at the store

are saying the same thing.

What? What?

You have to get a new look!

What? You get a new look!

The look I have is just fine.

What is your look?

Chocolate love, all right?

Take a pill.
100o/0.

I'm just trying to be your friend.

Drop it.

I tried opening up a club here.

But I'm just this poor brother
from Puerto Rico.

I got this club, that's one thing.

But soon that goes, I die and what
do I have? I got nothing.

I want something I can send home.

Something I can send to my
brother and say:

"Look at me.

Look at me and all the beautiful
women I've been with."

So, what? You want me
to talk to Jack?

Yeah. I mean, what am I
asking you here?

Honey, baby, please, talk to Jack.

Tell him I can do this.
I won't be bad.

You want to be in a movie?

Baby, please.

I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

Thank you, mamita.

Maurice, can I talk to you?

I need to talk you now.

Excuse me.

Can I join in?

Certainly.

Your cowboy...That's not dead.

Then what the fuck is
Becky talking about?

She's got a fucking something up
her ass. Fuck that shit.

Bitch.

Do a cannonball!

No, no. Watch this jackknife!

Did I look cool?

Pretty good.

I'll show you what you did wrong.

Full flip.

You all right?

You have to bring your legs
all the way around.

I know. I know.

This is my point.

You know what I'm saying?

Wear what you dig.

Just wear what you dig.

That's what I say.

What's the problem?

Should I get that?

Hello.

Can you speak a little
louder, please?

A who?

A Maggie?

Do you know a Maggie?
I don't.

There's no Maggie here.

Your mother?

Just give me a second.

Watch that for me, okay?

Excuse me, is there a Maggie here?

Are you Maggie? You're not?
Are you Maggie?

Do you know Maggie?

Oh, man, can you believe that?

Hello? I'm sorry,
there's no Maggie here.

No, no, it's not a problem.
Okay, ciao.

Who was it?

Some kid looking for his mom.

What are you doing?

What's it look like?

That's my wife.

Shut up, Bill.
You're embarrassing me.

Yeah, Little Bill, shut up.

Kurt, how's it going?

What's wrong with you?

My fucking wife, man.

She's down there, some idiot's dick
in her. Everybody's watching.

It's an embarrassment!

I know. Anyway, listen.

For the shoot, I want to see about
getting this new zoom lens.

I was wondering if we'd be able
to get more lights too.

Jack wants a minimal thing.

Very often, minimal means
a lot more photographically

than people understand.

I understand.

I know you understand.

I mean other people.

I think what Jack is talking about
is minimal.

Not natural, but minimal.

Okay, fine.

I understand.

I want to give each film
its own look.

Can we talk about this later?

You got to go somewhere or...

Yeah. No, I mean...

I was hoping, for the shoot
tomorrow,

we could send Rocky down
to pick it up.

No, got you. You got to go
somewhere. So what the fuck?

It's only the photography
of the film.

Are you giving me shit?

No. No way, Little Bill.

My fucking wife has an ass in her
cock in the driveway! All right?

I'm sorry if my thoughts are not on
the photography of the film!

Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

Got you.

All right, where is it?

She's sick.

What the fuck is this?

I didn't do anything?

Is she breathing?

I don't know.

Maybe she did too much coke.

Do you think so, doctor?

The girl's definitely OD'ed.

Fuck me. I want you to handle this
for me, Johnny.

You listening?

Drive her to Saint Joe's.

Drop her off in the front.
Understand me?

Got you.

Make sure no one sees the limo.

What is this?

This is twice in 2 days that
a chick has OD'ed on me!

Think it means you should think
about getting new shit?

Yes sir.

Shit, she's freaking out!

Look! With all this conversation!
Come on!

Please don't die!

Back door, Johnny.

You got it.

Fucking shit!

Get out of my way.

Bart is she all right?
Shut the fuck up!

Scotty J., how are you?

You know, you know.

Who's this?

Eddie, this is Scotty J.
He works on some of the films.

Nice to meet you.
Me too.

Are you going to be working or...

Maybe.
Probably.

That's great. How'd you meet Jack?

Because I work on the films.
Sometimes. So, if you ever...

Come here!
That's the boy.

Could you excuse me for a minute?

Very nice to meet you.
Take care.

Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

How do you do?

Eddie is interested in film.

I can't give you much advice that
Jack doesn't know...

but I can advise you to
think about your name.

My name?

Think about some name that
makes you happy, or...

something with a little pizazz.

The Colonel here, he puts up all
the money for our films.

It's an important part
of the process.

Great, great.

I look forward to seeing you
in action.

Jack says you have a big cock.

Well, I don't know. I guess so.

May I see it?

Really?
Please.

Thank you, Eddie.

No problem.

Thanks, Eddie.

You want to hear a poem I wrote?

"I love you

You love me

Going down the sugar tree.

We'll go down the sugar tree

And see lots of bees

Playing

Playing

But the bees won't sting

Because you love me."

That's it.
Great. You write that?

Yeah. I write songs too.

How's it going, boys?

Good time?

Excellent. It was a great party.
The best.

That's what Jackie's house is for.

To have a good time. Right?
That's right!

How about bubbles, Reed?

Excuse me, Jack?

I was thinking about what the
Colonel said about my name.

Do you have any ideas?

I had some thoughts. What about
you? What do you think?

My idea was, you know,
I just want a name...

I want it so it can cut glass.
Razor sharp.

Razor sharp, right.

When I close my eyes, I see this
thing, like this big sign.

And the name is in bright blue neon
lights with purple outline.

It just blows up because the name
is just so powerful.

It says "Dirk Diggler."

I think heaven has sent you here,

Dirk Diggler.

I think the angels have blessed
us all because of you.

You're Dirk!

Dirk Diggler!

Amen!

Talk to me, Kurt.

20 to 30.

Why?

I got tough shadows to deal with.

There's shadows in life, babe.

You want to go over this?

The set-up is...

Here we go.

One: Amber and Becky telephone the
agents to send over some actors.

Two: enter Reed to audition
for Amber.

They go at it. Becky watches.

Three: Becky goes to the
bathroom to jack-off.

She gets interrupted by Amber,
they go at it.

Four...

Who's Dirk Diggler?

That's that new good-looking kid,
Eddie, at the club.

Good name.

Anyway, enter Dirk. He meets Becky,
they go at it.

No. Change that, will you? I want
Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

Got it.

Darling?

Where you going?

To wash my vagina.

How long will you be?

2 seconds.

You want it clean, don't you?

I'm back now.
I'm ready to start my...

I'm supposed to come get you now and
tell you they're all ready now.

Do you think you could
give me a minute?

Thanks.

I'm back now.

I'm ready to start my
acting career.

That's right.

You look really good.

And you look really sexy.

I like your name a lot.

You do?
It's really cool.

You'll be right down there.

How's my boy?
Great!

Let's do it.

Remember what we talked about?

You're going to come through the
door, walk right over here.

I'll say:

"Action, Eddie." That'll be
your cue, right?

You enter, you walk right over here
to the desk to Amber and...

we shoot.

Do we go right into the sex or...

Is that all right?

Is that okay with you?

Good.

You don't need a rehearsal?

It's okay. I can do it.

We'll shoot the rehearsal.

Could I ask you something?

I was wondering if you could
call me Dirk Diggler from now on?

Absolutely. I'm sorry.

No, it's all right.

From now on.

Let's get a good one.

Want to practice your lines?

No, I know it.

You look great, honey.

Does he want me to keep going
until I come?

Yeah, come when you're ready.

Where?

Where do you want?

Wherever you tell me.

Come on my tits if you
can, okay?

Pull it out and do it on my stomach
and my tits, if you can.

No problem.

Are you all right, honey?

This is great. I'm fine.
I just want to do good.

I want it to be really good.
I was wondering,

Great.

You all right?

Enter through this door. "Action,"
that's your cue.

You got the lines for the scene?

If you drop one, call for it.
But do not stop. Okay?

Want some water or something?
I'm fine.

You'll do fine.

Roll it, Scotty.

Speed.

Sticks.

Marker.

Camera's set. We're ready, Chief.

And...

action, Dirk.

Hello. Are you John?

Yes, ma'am.

Your agency recommends you
very highly.

I'm a hard worker. If you give me
a job, I won't disappoint you.

What special skills do you have?

I've been in the Marines
for three years.

I just got back
from a tour of duty.

You're kidding.

I'm not. And it got really hard

being surrounded by all those guys
all day.

How long since you had a woman?

A long time.

That's terrible.

But now I'm back, and I'm ready
to pursue my acting career.

As you may or may not know, this is
an important film for me.

If it's not a hit, I'll get kicked
out of my apartment.

My landlord's a jerk.

Really?

Take your pants off. It's important
I get an idea of your size.

No problem.

I think that you have the job, but
why don't I make sure of something?

This is a giant cock.

Little Bill, we've rolled out.

We got to change mags.

Do it quickly.

Is everything cool?

We just got to change the angle.

Does it look sexy?

It's great.

You're doing so good.

Does it feel good?

Roll sound, Scotty.

Speed.

Quiet. Sticks.

We're back.

Action, kids.

Okay, we're going to go down now.

Down again.

John, you're a wonderful actor.

You're a wonderful actor!

You're amazing.

You feel so good.

Are you ready to come?

Come in me.

Don't worry. I'm fixed.
I want you to come in me.

Oh, God!

Wonderful.

Cut! Terrific!

Nice work!

Was it sexy?

Rock and roll!

Really good!

Doesn't he fuck like a champ?

He rocks.

The camera loves you.

I didn't get the come shot.

We missed the come shot.

He came inside her.

Maybe we could go to stock footage.

Are you crazy?

It won't match.

I could do it again
if you need a close-up.

Here we go.

Everyone say, "Dirk!"

There are real wood.

These are great.

Those are cool Are they lizard?

No, they're Italian. I'm going to
fucking buy these.

Guys?

It's funny you say that because
we should be in a band.

You like my shoes?

Pretty cool.

I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool.

They're embossed leather with this
patchwork reptilian-pattern design.

Can we have some hot sauce?

Want to sit down and help yourself?.

Say hello to Jaime Lynn. Scotty.

So, you're a Leo?

My girlfriend wants to meet you.

This is Raymond.

What's your name?

Excuse me?

Becky Barnett!

Raymond's a Leo.

I knew it.

What's your sign?
I'm a Pisces.

What? I can't deal with no Pisces.

That shirt's pretty sexy.

This is, like, imported
Italian nylon.

And it's, like, a special edition
limited silk print.

And it was done by this
really famous...

design artist from Italy.

Pick a card.

What's up, baby? I love you!

I'm going to cut the deck
one time, all right?

Now I'm going to make your card
rise from the deck.

Damn!

2 of diamonds, right?

That's my card!

But doesn't it make you nervous

when you're dealing
with those evil forces?

Horses? What?

No, the evil forces!

Evil? No, man, it's not evil.
It's an illusion.

Yeah, it's confusing.

Thank you.

We're going to try and do this
all in one shit!

So, we start like this, and then
you roll her over, Dirk.

Roll with him, but try to give me
every single position.

Is that possible?

Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg
around...No, the left one.

Around and over. Good.

See, we can go right into
doggy-style.

Perfect.

Is the movement on the waterbed
a problem?

No, not at all, Kurt, I dig it.
It's great.

Okay, can we do this?
Yeah.

All right, everybody. Here we go.

This is going to be great.

Do you want me to use
the Spanish accent?

"Jack Horner has found something
special in newcomer Dirk Diggler."

It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

Digger delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

His presence when dressed is
powerful and demanding."

"Stripped to the bone,

Diggler's more eruptive
than a volcano on a bad day."

"Amber Waves' cherry lips

do a great job of
handling Diggler's wide load..."

"Rocking Reed Rothchild's stiff
biceps do a slapping good job...

job with Becky Barnett's
supple ass."

"But it's Dirk Diggler that remains
the stand-out in this film.

It's easy to predict
after only 2 films

Diggler's suck-cess
can only grow...

and grow and grow and grow and grow

and grow and grow
and grow and grow."

What else?

That's it for now. Look at the
character Holmes came up with.

And look, I just...

Tell me.

I don't like seeing women
treated that way.

The guy who plays Johnny Wadd.

It's always about
slapping a girl around.

It's not right. It's not cool.

It's just not sexy. It's not sexy
like it should be.

The guy's more like
a James Bond-type character.

You know, he's classy.

He's a world-traveled guy.

I like that.

Reed could play my partner.

I like that a lot.

We could make it really good, Jack.

Honestly, if you direct it, we make
a whole series with a whole story.

It's exactly what we've
always talked about.

Please.

When we get back...

set up the typewriter.

We'll see what comes out of it.

But I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

You must work on the Colonel too,
you must be committed.

Right, right, Jack. I'll do
whatever I have to do.

Does this character have a name?

His name is "Brock Landers."

And his partner's name is
"Chest Rockwell."

Those are great names!

And the award for "Best NewComer"
goes to...

yes, my baby boy, Dirk Diggler!

And the award for "Best Cock"
goes to...

and here we go again, Dirk Diggler!

The award for "Best Actor"
goes to...

I've seen all his movies and
I can't wait to work with him!

Mr. Dirk Diggler!

I don't know what to say.

I guess the only thing
I can say is...

I'll promise to keep rocking and
rolling and making better films.

You know, it seems we
makes these movies...

and sometimes they're considered
filthy or something by some people.

But I don't think that's true.

These movies we make,
they can be better.

They can help, they really can.
I mean that!

We can always do better.

I'm going to keep trying,
if you guys keep trying.

Let's keep rocking and rolling.

Shot of tequila, straight up.

Yes, ma'am.

I've been in this place for 20
minutes just to get a seat.

Are you alone?
Yeah.

Just visiting LA.

Some people told me the food in
here was really good.

It's not good. It's the best place
to eat in all of LA.

It's excellent.

I hope so. I could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.

Still hungry?

Starving.

Why don't you feast on that.

Oh, it's true.

What's that?

You are Brock Landers.

Freeze!

Don't make me chase you, Raphael!

Freeze!

We're almost there. I want you
to trim the head.

Take the shot of Reed
with the revolver.

Just dump it and switch
the title card.

I want it to come flying out of
the screen at the audience.

Nice. Piece of cake.

That's my guy.

I told him, this is a special
party for Scotty J.

I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne.

This is what he gave me. Take a sip
of this and tell me what you think.

This is supposed to be really good
stuff. Here, take a sip.

Is that pretty light?
Yeah, that is.

What do you think?

It's beautiful!

Look how spacious it is.

Yeah, look. I like these.

That's custom made. That's real
Italian leather.

Watch this.

What's that?

My initials.

That's imaginative! How'd you
think of that?

I was thinking of my name
and dreamt it up.

I'm almost finished.
It looks great.

I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

It looks great.

It's a good piece for conversation.
It's really neat.

Jesse did all that oil painting
as well.

Buck is still installing
the stereo.

That's a bean bag!

And that lamp...those are real
sterling silver.

It's a very interesting room.
It has a very modern feel too.

Watch this. You ready?
Can't wait to see it.

It's my dojo.
It's all Asian! An Asian room!

It has that whole karate feel.

It's very comfortable.

Yeah. A lot of ancient China.

I have my statues
for my Best Actor awards.

A good place to keep your awards.
I'm glad.

Look up there.

Oh, that's handy.

Can you see yourself?.
Yeah.

It's great, huh?

It's my whole, entire wardrobe.

It's all perfectly organized for me
by color as well as designer.

You don't have to think about it
or anything.

You'll love it. This is my favorite
thing in the world.

Close your eyes.

Okay, you ready?
Yeah, baby.

Isn't it beautiful?

Oh, God.

This is it. This is the thing.

You deserve this, baby.

Isn't it great?

This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

Want to go for a ride?

Oh, yeah!

She rocks!

Hold on!

You set us up, Chico.

Fuck with Raphael and Ringo,

that's your business.
Don't fuck with Chest!

You know what? You're not even worth
it! I gave you a chance!

I trusted him.

Well, we almost solved the case.

At least the women are safe.

Let's go get some of that
Saturday night beaver.

No one fucks with Chest and Brock.

This is the best work
we've ever done.

It's a real film, Jack.

It feels good.

You made it fly.

This is the film...

I want them to remember me by.

Thank you.

As far as I'm concerned, it's all
about love. You know what I mean?

If you love someone, how hard
can the world be?

Peole will come and they will go,

and so will Problems,
but ultimately...

if you have got love on your side,
and it is just...

I mean, it is just
deep down in your soul...

what's a problem that takes your
attention away from that?

Do you understand?

I'm Becky Barnett.

Jerome.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too, Becky.

So, what do you do?

I'm in the auto industry.

I'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

That's great, that's great.

You've got a really
nice smile, Becky.

Thank you...

Jerome.

The Colonel.

Floyd Gondolli!

Great you could make it.
Great, great!

How are you? You look happy.

I'm fine.

Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.

Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

These are the next stars.

There are the real people
in the world.

I think we ought to talk to Jack.

Iron this thing out
before the new year?

Let's do it.

But what were you thinking?
What were you feeling?

Did you do research?

What are you talking about here?

Oh, nothing.

Want to come with me for a while?

Where?

It's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

Yeah, let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

Hey, Buck.

Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

Are you sitting alone?

Yes.

Todd Parker!

Rocking Reed Rothchild!

You made it!

It's an amazing party.
Fucking chicks everywhere.

You bet. Courtesy of
Jack Horner, thank you.

I wouldn't mind me having a piece
of that action over there.

Michelle. I'll introduce you.

Sure. Introduce her to my lap.

Did you get off work?

Don't dance Sunday nights.

Who's Vette is that in the driveway?

Dirk.

I'm jealous of him.

That shit's jamming.

Start down low with a 350 cube.
3 1/4 horsepower,

4 speed, 4-10 gears...

10 coats of orange, hand-rubbed
lacquer with a dual-plane manifold.

Full fucking race cams.

I'm pretty happy with it, you know?

It's a great look for you, I think.

It's pretty original,
you know, I think.

Take this off.
