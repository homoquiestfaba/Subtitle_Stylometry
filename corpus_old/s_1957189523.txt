[wind whistling]

[horses whinny]
[gunshot]

[country western
music playing]

Hyah! Hyah!

[men yelling]

[man grunts]
Hyah! Hyah!

[man shouting indistinctly]

[horse neighs]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

No, no, no!

Not a good time
to give up on me.

No, no, no.

[rifle cocks]

Well, this is one hell
of an embarrassing thing.

Me standing here,
the near dead horse and all.

Hmph! Sure is.

Don't try nothing, boy.

In no position
to try anything.

[shackles jangle]

[lawman grunts]

Hey, what ya doing?
Thanks for the ride.

He's getting away!
Gentleman.

Get off that horse!

You're welcome.

Pinkerton Agent:
Don't look so slick now.

Got it worked out
real good.

[chains jingling]

Robert LeRoy Butch Parker.

You've been with us a year.

And I see here
that your father's

a preacher back in Utah.

I'm assuming that he raised
you to be an honorable

and God-fearing man.

Yeah, all right, maybe you
rode off the trail a bit.

But, because of your youth

and this being
your first offense,

I'm willing to give
you a second chance.

I'll see fit to
give you a pardon.

if you'd give me you word
you'll break no more laws.

I can't make that
promise, your honor.

What?

My father did raise
me to know the value

of keeping my word.

So I just can't stand
here and tell you

I'm gonna be able to go
on the straight and narrow

when I don't know
if I really can.

I wouldn't want to lie
to you, your honor.

But I tell you what,

if you let me go I
will give you my word

that I won't commit any
more crimes in Wyoming.

Well, I believe
that's good enough

for the state of Wyoming.

[crows cawing]


I told you not
to run off on your own.

You don't learn
too quick, do ya?

Well, I'm smarter now.

And it cost you a year of
your life to learn that lesson.

Get on.

I don't think I can ride
with any more, Mr. Cassidy.

I promised the governor
I wouldn't commit

any more crimes in Wyoming.

Well, Butch, my boy,

I found us a beautiful
little hideaway,

right on the border of
Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah.

So you don't have to
do anything in Wyoming

you don't want to.

Gimme the reins.

[Cassidy chuckles]

Boys, calm down.

Please stop your fussing
and hold still.

-Jessie, just... let's
put your shawl on.

[children fussing]
There, you look beautiful.

[fussing continues]

Boys, if you just
hold still, please.

Children, just hold
still for one minute.

It's just a photograph,
I promise it won't hurt a bit.

[children yelling]

[gunshot]
[dramatic music playing]

Well, now that
we got your attention,

you all better do it what
this young lady wants,

or I'ma shoot
someone's ears off.

Starting with you.
[boy gasps]


Harry Longabaugh.

That was an irresponsible,
patently dangerous,

and just a damn
foolish thing to do.

My specialty.

[children giggle and groan]

[flashbulb puffs]

[tools clammoring]

Really all that fancy gunplay
hasn't helped get you a job.

More to life than
getting a job, Etta.

Mm-hmm.

I'm just kidding, honey.

Besides, these guns may
just prove you wrong.

What are you talking about?

I heard about a job in town.

Big outfit, need my guns.

A hired gun, Harry?

No, honey, I'm protecting
a dude city slicker's ranch

from coyotes and such..

I'm going over there now.

Just think,
have money coming in,

get a new house.

What about my
sister, Mary Margaret?

Can't get married until
she finds someone first.

She's my elder.

She's a wild cat.

Harry, I'm serious.

So's you don't forget.

She just needs someone who
loves her to settle her down.

-Uh-huh.
-Like I did for you.

Maybe someone
at your new job.

I don't...
Good, stable, reliable man.

Okay, I keep
my eyes peeled.

Okay.

[Harry laughs]

I can tell you right now.

I wouldn't set anyone
I like up with you sister.

Heh! Get on your way.
[horse huffs]

Hyah!
Coming through.

Move it! Hyah!

[gentle music playing]

[gunfire in distance]

See that pumpkin, boys?
He's smiling at ya!

[men laugh
and cheer softly]

[man] That's five bucks
today, sunny boy.

Got that one shoot.

That's a pistol
not a whirligig.

[gunfire continues]

Man: Very nice!

Well... what do you think?

One hell of a wild bunch.

Yeah, the Wild Bunch.

Those the kind of men
we need.

Ain't a-one of them that ain't
wilder than you, ole Butch.

Well, Mike, you
taught me all I know.

But I had a lot of time
to think about my life

while I was in prison,

and I'm not sure I want
to do this anymore.

I'll abide
by your decision.

While you're thinking
about it...

you mind getting their
attention for me?

Hey, hey, hey!
We got a new player.

[overlapping chatter]


[men whooping]

Man #1: Ooh, doggy.
Whoo!

Man #2: All right.

All you new guys, we're
gonna have us a little race.

Find out how good
you really are.

You'll to ride
to the end of the valley.

There you'll find
a corral full of horses.

You jump on one and you
ride like hell back here.

Why we gotta
change horses?

Switching mounts
when a law dog's on your tail

might just save your life.

Uh-huh. Well, you gonna ride
against us, city slicker?

[men chuckling]

I mean, seeing
as how you know so much.

Butch already has
a place with us.

He doesn't need ride.

'Less of course he wants to.

Well... do you?

[Mike chuckling]

Man #3: Come on.

[men whooping]

I'll show you who's got it.
Yeah!

Man #4: We have a race going!
Man #5: Come on!

[men shouting,
horses neighing]

Hey, dude...
good luck.


[men yelling
and horses neighing]

[hooves thundering]

-Hyah! Hyah hyah!
Come on!

Man: You ain't
collecting this race.

Have a nice trip!

[men yelling indistinctly]

Thanks for holding
my horse, cowpoke.

Good luck to you.

[Harry chuckles]

-Hyah!
-Get up, get up!

-[gunshot]
-What?

[Harry laughs]

[men yelling indistinctly]

Congratulations.

That was a fine ride,
and even better shooting.

From a moving horse.

What a shot.

I'm impressed.

I am genuinely impressed.

I heard about
a two-gun sharpshooter

from Sundance, Wyoming,

carries a matched pair
of nickel-plated Colts,

just like yours.

You him?

Yeah.

Come on and let
me buy you a drink.

I'm Butch Parker from Utah.

Never heard of you.

Cassidy: It's not the banks,
it's railroads.

Railroads own the banks.

They control all the money.

They decide who gets
the loans.

They'll foreclose on anybody
who gets in their way.

Handful of evil men
who took a life out west.

Railroads, pushing our way
of life right off of this land.

The way I see it...

only a handful
of men can stop them.

[liquid pouring]

You.

Here's a toast to y'all,

the first of a new breed!

Sons of men who inherited
wide open spaces.

-Men who ride free.
-Yeah.

The Wild Bunch!


[glasses clink]

You're gonna
set things right.

[men chuckle]
Hey.

How we gonna do that, Mike?

By hitting them
where they live.

Morning.

Morning.
Morning.

You ready to use those
fancy smoke wagons?

Don't worry about me,
fancy britches.

It's not the cut
of your pants, kid,

it's what you got in them.

What the hell
does that mean?

Means, are you ready?

Yeah, I'm ready.

How'd I get partnered with you?
I don't even like you.

I asked for you.

Why?

Any shooting
starts in that bank

I want those fancy
pistolas behind me.

What are you supposed to do?

Make sure the
shooting doesn't start.

Good morning, let me
help you with that, sir.

Oh, my sweet Lord!

Butch: Unless
you want to meet him,

I wouldn't cause any ruckus.

Now get behind that
counter, ya hear?

[metal clangs]

[suspenseful music]

See, that wasn't
so difficult.

Now all we want's the
railroad company's payroll.

I can't.
Harry: Come on!

You don't owe that
bloodsuckers any loyalty!

I mean, I can't open this.

The railroad's
money is in the safe

and I can't open the safe.

Only the bank president,
Mr. Watson, does that.

I'm Baton.
I'm the head clerk.

-The only clerk.
-[gun cocks]

Well, when does
Mr. Watson get here?

Well, he's been keeping
company with the piano teacher

from Bisbee.

Sometimes he don't get
in until...

Out making
beautiful music, huh?

What the hell
does that mean?

Let's take what we can!

No, we only came
from the railroad money.

Damn.

Wiry old boy and a black hat
with a gray duster

are headed this way.

That'll be Mr. Watson
and Sheriff Jenkins.

Sheriff?

Elzy, walk
on out of here, slow.

Now, we're gonna
stroll outta here

like we just made a deposit,

and I don't wanna hear
a word different out of you

until you can't hear
our horses, you got that?

You got that?

[gun clicks]

Trust him?

I'm a good judge
of character.

[spurs jingling]

Bandits!

Run!

Bank robbers!
Outlaws!

Some judge of character.

Thief!

[Elzy grunting]

Elzy, come on.

Come on, let's go!

Sheriff: Hands up.

Wait, they got Elzy.

Get off that horse.

[horse whinnies]

Down off your horses!

[gun bangs]

Ride, come on, ride!

[dramatic music]

Posse on our tail.

Where's the money?
We didn't get it.

Where's Elzy?
They got him.

We can't leave Elzy!

He'll be fine
sitting in their jail.

You want to join him,
you go back.

Otherwise I suggest you
ride the hell out of here.

[horses whinny]

Hey, I heard about a dude
sharpshooter from Utah.

You him?

[Harry laughs]

Again?

Rob the same bank?

That's crazy.

Exactly.

They'd never expects
us to come back

after the way you boys
humiliated yourselves

this morning.

We'll catch them
completely off guard.

Why take the risk?

So we can get
what we went there for,

the railroad payroll.

We need that money
to get Elzy a lawyer.

Some wild bunch.

Elzy wouldn't even be caught
if you hadn't turned tail.

Is that true, Butch?

Yeah, that's true.

We could have stayed
and shot it out,

then we'd all be
in jail or dead.

Better dead on two feet
than shot in the back,

runnin' out of town like
a yellow-bellied dog.

I understand how you feel.

Heck, I even rode with Elzy
and Mike back in Wyoming.

We'll get him out.

Come on, let me
buy you a drink.

I feel like drinking
with no coward.

He's off the reins,
Simpkins.

And you, bushwhacker,
with your two guns and all.

That belt just for keeping your
britches from falling down.

You're as yellow as
fancy hat over here.

See, now, you
got everyone upset.

Two whiskeys.
You don't want one...

Hey, round
for the whole room... Oh!

Should I go for the pair?

[all laughing]

Don't stop riding
while the sun's still out!

[men hooting
and laughing]

I ever mentioned how much
I admire your shooting?

Just payin' ya back
for getting my bacon

out of that fire
in town there.

I'm obliged, Sundance.

Look, Butch,
I was wondering,

Heh!

Well, are you
seeing anyone?

I mean, like, romantic, like?

Look, I may dress a little
nicer than your average waddie,

and, yeah, it did just get
out of prison, but don't...

No, not for me.

Sister Mary Margaret.

A nun?

[chuckles] No, not hardly.

Listen, um...

Well, let me tell you
about her over a drink.

You'll need it.

Etta: He's from Utah.

A Mormon?
I suppose.

He works on the ranch
with Harry.

He's new to the territory,
he doesn't know anyone.

Harry just thought
we'd be sociable.

Now don't you know that you
can't play matchmaker with me,

little sister,

because you have
no idea what kind of man

I would take a liking to.

Or maybe you do.
Mm-hmm.

Etta, Mary Margaret,
this here is Butch Parker.

Charmed, Ms. Place.

The pleasure's mine,
Mr. Parker.

That's encouraging.

Hear that?

Said he was charmed.

I don't have to be charmed.
I already got you.

[upbeat fiddle music playing,
people laughing]

[dancers chatting
and hooting]

Gather 'round, boys!

â™ªâ™ª

You're gonna tire him
out, Mary! [laughs]

[music ends, dancers applaud]

Whoo!

Harry, I need
to wet my whistle.

Miss, would you
care to dance with me?

[Etta giggles]

[slow music playing]

What?

Harry says you're
a photographer.

For now.

You don't like it?
It's fine,

but I'm not gonna work
for the Rifle Standard

for the rest of my life.

I wanna see
the world in the world.

What's in the world?

Places with people
completely different than us.

Countries across the ocean.

Countries below the equator.

The equator's a line,

like a belt that goes
around the world.

Thanks.
[Etta laughs]

[glasses rattling]

Mary Margaret: Thanks.

What's that from?

Uh, bullet,

courtesy of the great
state of Wyoming.

A gift from Deputy
Bob Kimberley.

He shot you?

It was a misunderstanding.

I was young
and, uh, impetuous.

But now
you're a ranch hand?

For now.

[Etta giggles]

â™ªâ™ª

Harry, I think you have
trouble over there.

â™ªâ™ª

I sure do.

â™ªâ™ª

Well, look what we got here.

Baby Butch Parker
and the Sunday School Kid.

What's he mean?
Who are these men?

Ooh!
Oh, just drunks.

Let's discuss this outside.

Yeah, let's take it
in the street.

Harry.

It's okay.

Let's get
this dance started.

Listen, nobody
has to get shot tonight.

Oh, you two ain't getting
out of this alive.

Yank ain't those fancy
hog legs, Sundance.

Not so fast, Simpkins.

We have to make sure
if we do this right.

What the hell are
you talking about?

Well, there's four
of you and two of us.

I mean, who's gonna
shoot who?

Now, way I figure it is...
and you jump in here,

correct me if I'm wrong...

each of our guns
hold six bullets.

Now, 3 times 6 is 18.

So, well heck, Sundance,

you could shoot each
of them three times...

You fellas could just
unbuckle your gun belts now

and ride on out of town.

Think you're smart, huh?

Just reasonable, Henry.

I told you no one has
to get shot tonight.

Whatever you say.


[dramatic music]

Get outta here!

Get him and get outta here.

Simpkins: This ain't over.

What happened?

I thought I heard shooting.

The drunks,
we, uh, scared them off.

But that man over the saddle.
Dead drunk.

I'm not gonna change!

Where'd that come from?

I'm not gonna change.

Maybe I should go now.

You should.

Only wait.

Just a taste...

of what you might be missing.

Better go after Harry.

Butch!

What happened?

Nothing.
Nothing happened.

The way you ran off.

That's none
of your business, Butch.

The way you talked to Etta.

I know you're not
the kind of man

to talk to his woman like that.

Is that right?

And how do you know that?

You just met me.

You want me to go?
Fine.

No, I don't.

I don't know why
I talked to her like that.

I guess I sorta
took it out on her.

What?

I got...

I got blood on my hands,
Butch. [chuckles]

What are you talking about?

You killed men before.

Yeah, I can always dazzle

my way out of a gunfight.

You know?

Drawn quicker than they could.

Shooting... shooting
a cigarette out of their mouth,

putting a few holes
in the hat... pop, pop, pop!

You ever killed anyone, Butch?

Never had to.

I was raised to think
killing a man

send your soul
straight to hell.

Thanks.

[both chuckle]

What I mean is, well,
my father was a Bible man.

He taught us the good
book was against murder.

Killing somebody
for no good reason.

But that boy last night...

he was gonna kill us.

You did what you had to do.

What about the
bank job we gotta do?

I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

Way I figure it,
if I do my job right,

shooting never has to start
to begin with.

Keep everybody calm.

Keep everything going smooth.

But I need to know
you're with me, Sundance.

If somebody does
want to hurt us,

I gotta know you're ready
to what you have to do.

What if I just wound them?

[laughs]

Just as long as they don't
come after us.

Okay.
I'm ready.

[bell dings]

You again?

Butch: Railroad
company payroll, please.

You notice I said, please.
[gun cocks]

Toss her up.
Toss her up.

Come on, come on,
get along.

[Wild Bunch yelling]

[Elzy laughing]

Butch: Hold up, hold up!
Elzy!

Harry: What?
Butch: Let's get him now.

Yeah, let's get him!

Look out, Butch!
Whoo-hoo!

[Elzy laughs]
Hyah! Come on.

We're coming for ya!
Hyah hyah!

Look out, boys!
Let's get outta here.

Shoot 'em.
Ah!

[Sheriff grunts]

Harry: See you later,
suckers!

[train whistle blows]
Go west, young man.

Old man, young woman, hell,
I don't care who you are

as long as you let
my trains carry you west.

What's happening
to Abilene Spur line?

The engine move out yet?

Not yet.

Well, move 'em out.
We paid for that land.

You get the army to wipe out
the rest of their buffalo.

No buffalo,
no food, they'll move.

And what's all this grumbling
I'm hearing about

from the Northern Pacific line?

We're getting reports
of marauders in that area.

Oh, yes,
the Wild Bunch. Ha!

One of my banks in Utah

was pillaged by these savages.

The other stockholders
wanna know

what you're gonna
do about it, E.H.

You tell them I'm contracted
with the world-famous

Pinkerton Detective Agency
of Chicago, Illinois

and they are,
at this very moment,

working at striking
at the very heart

of this outlaw band.

Their days are numbered.

[train bell ringing]

[door bells ring]

[gun barrel clicks]
[women gasp]

[Elzy laughing]

Man: Over here, kid.

We got it, Butch.

Butch: One for you.

And one for you.

What the hell's
that about?

Public relations.

Harry: Tell the railroad

they've been robbed
by the Wild Bunch.

[all whooping]

Man: Wild Bunch
are robbing a bank.


Man: They're on our tail.
Do something, Butch!

Pinkerton Agent:
Shoot 'em down!

Butch: Come on, boys.
Man: I didn't mean that!

Agent: Come on, after 'em!

Butch: Hey, robbing from the
rich and giving to the poor!

[townsfolk shouting]

Agent: Move, move!

Man: That's the bank's
money they got!

Agent: Get outta the way!

Agent #2: Come on,
outta the way, outta the way!

Agent: Come on,
out of the way, move!

Put that money down!

[children shouting]

[upbeat music
playing on Victrola]

Etta's having fun.
Cool.

Doesn't bother you?

Heh! Etta having fun?

[Butch and Etta laughing]

With him.

Now why would it?

Things are changing, Harry.

Not for me.

[Etta laughing]

You have to try it, Harry.

I'm resting.

Come on, don't just sit
there like a bump on of stump.

Have a little fun.

All right.

All right?
There you go.

Thank you.

Men, you're
all still boys inside.

At some point
we have to grow up.

[Etta laughing]

Etta: Oh! Harry!

[crowd shouting]

Whoo-hoo!

[Etta laughs]

Some do not.

[children laughing]

[Mrs. Place snoring]

Mother.

Oh! Oh my.

Well, young Harry is a fine
looking prospect, Ethel.

Oh, this is Harry
Longabaugh, my intended.

What are you intending?

I'm just pleased as heck
to finally meet you, ma'am.

I was even riding out that

you might up and die before
I had a chance to meet you.

And this is
Mr. Parker, Mother.

One of Etta's
and my good friends.

Charmed, Mrs. Place.

Thank you.
Yeah, he's always charmed.

Let's eat, I'm starved.
Come on.

Heh!
Thank you, girls.

Outlaws!
Oh my, outlaws.

Well, that's all they were
talking about on the train,

The Wild Bunch.

Must be terribly frightening

knowing those men are out
there just waiting to strike.

I do worry
about it sometimes.

Well, there ain't
much worth stealing

around here except...

Well, except
this fine little gal.

You know, I gotta
tell you, Mama Place,

she's... she's really
great around the kitchen.

Yes.

Your uncle Martin
went to Boston

to work on the new
electric trolley cars.

They have almost
completely replaced

the horse-drawn carriage.

You can't replace
a good horse.

Oh, I'd love to see that.

When do you plan to return?

We're going back
at the end of the week.

We?

Yes, Mary Margaret,
Ethel, and myself.

Well, that's why I came,
to bring my girls back.

I'm not going.
What?

Well, I've decided
to stay out west.

Ethel, I thought
we had discussed.

I don't wanna talk
about it now, Mother.

Mary Margaret, have you
also lost your senses?

No, I'm going.

Had my fill
of the Wild West.

[indistinct conversation
in background]

Harry?

Harry.

I thought you were Harry.

I did too
for a minute there.

It's good.

I'm gonna sit down and eat.

[bell ringing]

Afternoon, Etta.

Where's Harry?

I dunno.

Well, I thought
you two were inseparable.

I wanted to see you.

I wanted to talk to you alone.

Alone?

Should I be worried,
Mr. Parker?

Worried's too strong
a word, Ms. Place.

Concerned?

Why don't we
start with concern

and see if we can
work up to worry?

Can we walk?

All right.

You're not doing much talking.

I'm thinking
of my phraseology.

You've had some schooling?

My father was a minister.

He read to us
from the Good Book

to where we could read
from it ourselves.

After that,
other books are easy.

So what was it you wanted to
talk to me about, Mr. Parker?

Well...

just that...

I have feelings for you, Etta.

Well, I like you too.

No, I mean,

I love you.

You know I love Harry.

I know.

I think you love me too.

Well that's kind of brash.

The other night
when we...

when you thought
I was Harry,

I felt something.

I think you felt it too.

What if I did?

Harry is as good
as my fiance.

He's your best friend.

Yeah, I know that.

So then what in God's name

are you hoping to accomplish
by telling me this?

This here's a wild country.

And you never know
what happens.

What could happen?

Nothing.

Anything.

[gentle music playing]

Either way, I just wanted
you to know is all.

[hooves thumping]

Hey.

I was waiting for you.

I'll just be a minute.

Man: Hey, wanna
give me a hand with this?

[men chattering]

The railroads
are running scared.

With us grabbing their payrolls
these last five months,

the workers have stopped
working the lines.

Production's bogged down,

and looks like
the stockholders

are about ready to jump ship.

[all cheer]

Thanks to a tip from
Durango we found out

the railroad company is sending
a huge amount of payroll

in order to quiet
the unrest.

One train with
enough cash to cover

a full year of operations.

[men chuckle and hoot]

But I heard tell in town
the railroad was splitting up

their payroll into a bunch
of stagecoach shipments.

Yeah.
They're decoys.

Railroad's been
spreading that story

hoping we go after
them stagecoaches.

Are we?

Of course not, you imbecile.

The railroad
will think we are.

Instead, we're gonna hit the
train with everything we got.

Since we ain't never
rob no train before,

it's gonna take
a lot of planning.

Let's get down to it.
Durango.

All right, gather
around, boys.

[men chatting]

Butch...

be careful.

Mike, careful is what
I do best, you know that.

This ain't
my first game, Butch.

You know why
the others went bad?

Someone got greedy.

It's always the last
person you expected.

[men laughing]

Not him.

Well, money has a way
of twisting people.

You just keep your eyes
open, all right?

[church bell ringing]

Durango: Don't read it,
just send it.

[train whistle tooting]

[train horn blares]

[brakes squealing]

What's the problem?

No problem.
Train's being robbed.

Yeah, no problem,
train's being robbed.

[Harry and Elzy laugh]

Come on!

[suspenseful music]

Butch, you sure
this gonna be enough dynamite?

We'll know in a minute.

Take cover!

[fuse hisses]
Yeah!

[outlaws laughing]

[fuse hisses]

[explosion roars,
horses whinnying]

[outlaws hooting]

Durango: All aboard,
gentlemen!

-What the... Aah!

Butch: Pinkertons!

It's a trap! Pinkertons!

Come on, fellas!
Come on!

Ride on outta here, boys!

Harry: Come on,
let's get outta here!

[overlapping shouting]

Unh!
Get outta here!

Butch! Butch, come on!

They knew
we were coming, kid.

They knew we were coming!
Hyah!

Let's go!
[horse whinnying]

They'll never find us.

They're headed right here.

They know exactly
where we are.

What are you saying?

We have a traitor
amongst us.

A Pinkerton spy set us up.

Where'd you get that?

Found it in his saddlebag.

What?
No!

Butch, we don't
have time for this.

Get out of the way.

Mike, you known me
since I was a kid.

I say it's not Sundance,
it's gotta be somebody else.

He's your friend.

I expect you to say
something like that.

No, he's not smart enough.

He couldn't think of
a way to set us up.

Not him then who?

Him.

You set this up.

You never asked to go in
first before. Why tonight?

I'll tell you why.

'Cause he told the Pinkertons
he'd be the first man

inside the freight car.

[Durango laughs]

That's it?

That's your big proof,
I went in first?

You can't believe
this crap, Mike.

They didn't start shooting
until after you got in there.

You callin' me
a liar, Elzy?

Why were you
so brave tonight?

I've never known you
to lead the pack.

[gunfire outside]

Man: Pinkertons!

Law dogs in the hole!

Come on , let's go,
let's go, let's go!

[gun cocks]

[gunshot]
[Cassidy grunts]

[hinges squeak]

Mike! Mike!

[grunting]
Mike, no, no, no, no!

Butch.

[Cassidy exhales]

Butch!
Mike!

We gotta go!

I'm not leavin' him.
Leave him or we join him!

Come on, come on!

I'm gonna wire
the railhead.

Tell them they can send the
real payroll shipment through.

It's too risky.
They're still out there.

I don't think so.

Yeah?
Where'd you get that from?

Reading dime novels while
you're shining some chair

with your ass back
in Chicago?

I've been out here
living undercover,

riding with outlaws for years.

They must be spread
all over the country by now.

It'll take years to round them
up with Mike Cassidy dead.

I know Butch.
He'll keep them together.

We better get to them first

'cause now they just
won't be looking to steal.

Gonna be looking
for vengeance, boys.

[somber harmonica playing]

So what now?

All the money's
in Brown's hold.

Damn Pinkerton's
have it by now.

We'll get more.

How?

No horses, no money.

Hell, we ain't got nothing.

Wild Bunch is dead.

Durango's seen to that and
the Pinkerton's have killed it.

That's good.
There's a reckoning coming,

and it's riding hellbent
for leather with a new gang,

a new beginning.

We're the Hole
in the Wall Gang now.

All right.
What's the plan, Parker?

Name's not Parker.

Call me Cassidy.

Butch?

Butch Cassidy.

We're gonna get Durango
and the railroad.

[thunder crashes]

Outlaws?

Not just any outlaws,
ma'am, the Wild Bunch.

[sighs]
And Mr. Parker?

He's the worst of the lot.
He's the ringleader.

There it is.

I see this is quite
a mighty powerful shock

to you, Ms. Place.

And I am truly sorry
for that.

Shock?

You just told me the man that
I love is a wanted outlaw,

and everything
that I thought...

Okay.

I've taken up
enough of your time.

Just be careful.

Oh, and let
the sheriff's office know

if they try to contact you.

They're desperate men now.

Thank you.

[thunder crashes]

Etta, darlin'.

Don't "darlin'" me,
you polecat!

What are you doing here?
Just let me explain.

The Pinkertons did quite
a good job explaining.

The Sundance Kid.

Why didn't you just tell
me what was going on?

Well, I just couldn't.

But you're here now.

Why?

I want to take
you away with me.

Away with you?

You're a robber, a killer.
You lied to me.

And I'm...
I'm sorry I hurt you, Etta,

but I never lied to you.

I never lied about
what kind of man I was.

I didn't try
to hide it from you.

Please, Harry.

Are you even Harry anymore or
you just the Sundance Kid now?

I should've known.
I should've known.

I knew there was more money

coming in a ranch
hand could make.

Butch.

Did you bring him
into it or did he bring you?

No, I guess
it doesn't matter now.

I know I didn't tell
you what I was doing,

but I only did it
to make money,

so that we could get
outta here,

and I can give you
the life that you wanted.

We can still have that,
but you gotta come with me.

We got to leave right now.

And go where?

On the run for how long?

Forever?

As long as we're together.

What kind of life
would we have?

What do I tell our children

when they wanna know
where their daddy is?

In jail? Hanged?

No.

Leave.

Don't do this, Etta.
Now.

Go!

At some point, Etta,

you're gonna have to
stop just looking at life

and start living it.

[thunder rumbles]

[door slams]

She wouldn't go?

Hell, she hates me now.

I'm sorry.

Ah, I'm just trying
to make a life, you know?

Think she'd see that ain't
easy for man like me.

We were born too late.

A whole new century
just around the corner.

Frontier's almost gone.

Cities sprouting up
like weeds.

I like riding for days
without seeing another soul.

Feel my Colts
around my hips.

Barbed wires,

fencing in the ranges.

And now even Tombstone
won't let you wear guns

on the streets anymore.

Yeah?
Railroad's beaten us.

See that glass there?

The bartender said, hey,
Lily, what'd you say?

Oh, the railroad had them
make that mirror in Germany.

They sent it all the way
by boat in one piece

all around the Cape of Good Hope

and by railroad just
to get to this spot.

See?

All courtesy of the railroad.

[thunder rumbles]

[glass shatters]

I broke the railroad's mirror.

I oughta pay
with the railroad's money.

See, Kid... we're just
gonna have to change.

Well, let's change then.

Right after we rob
that train.

[thunder rumbles]

[hooves thumping]

[horse whinnying]

They're close.

All right, boys, be alert.

Once we get moving,
they can hit us

anywhere between here
and Utah.

Watch your target.

Don't be blowin' each
other's heads off.

I can't believe they're
gonna try and take us

when they know we're
expecting them.

That's exactly
why Butch'll do it.

Conductor: All aboard!

Safe locked?
Yes, sir.

All right,
let's bolt this door.

You still think
they're gonna try it?

You bet your life on it,
which ain't worth much to me.

Thanks.

They're probably gonna
hit us just after crossing

the bridge over
to Turkey Creek Gorge.

It's the most remote
stretch on the line.

I want you to post a rifleman
on top of every car.

They're not getting
on this train.

Butch: Too late
for that, old buddy.

Durango: How the hell
did you get in here?

What'd you think?

We're gonna ride down
a moving train on horseback?

That's so 19th century.

We bought tickets.

Hand over your guns.

Guns in the bag, boys.

Heh!

Well hey, hey, it Elzy Lay.

How you doing, sod buster?

You ain't gonna get
away with this, Parker.

The name's Cassidy now.
Butch Cassidy.

Just to show I don't forget
those who are good to me,

and bad.

You're crazy, mister.

Now why would you
say a thing like that?

Durango: You fire that
peacemaker, Butch,

and I got a dozen
men in the next car

just waiting to run in here.

Harry: Hey, Butch.

It's time.

Now get this train moving.

[steam hisses]

[bell rings]

I guess we'll just have
to finish our business

some other time, old friend.

I guess we will... Unh!

[passengers gasp]

[Durango coughs]

Excuse me, folks.

I've got some business with
the front end of this train.

[wheels squeal]

I'll be damned.

What the hell
you standing around for?

They're getting way,
let's go!

Come on!

Come on!
Give me that rifle, come on!

Let's go!
Get on those damn horses!

Man: Let 'em out,
let 'em out!

-Hyah!
-Come on, move it!

[Butch knocking]

Pinkertons, I'll give you
one minute to open this door

and leave the car
before we blow it open.

You don't want to get hurt

I suggest you come
on out of there.

You and your band of
cutthroats can go to hell.

[all laughing]

Open it up.

You robbing the train?
That's right.

You're the Hole in
the Wall Gang, ain't ya?

That's us.

Yeah, I work
for Union Pacific

nigh on 10 years.

Found myself
a spread in Nebraska.

Finest dirt you ever saw.

That damned railroad, they
come in and they took my land,

and they run me out.

Well, you take them damn
bastards for all they got.

Oh, and When you finished
with the train,

you boys are welcome for dinner.

Much obliged, but I don't
think we'll be staying.

You inside,

I'm fixing open the door
and the safe with one load.

I told you we
ain't coming out!

I know.

I just want to make sure all
the single men's up front,

so I don't make too many widows.

[gang laughing]

[Pinkertons shouting]
[rifle cocks]

Agent: Get 'em!

Hold your ground!

Let's get on out of here.

[dramatic music playing]

It's gonna be a big one.

They got a whole lot
of dynamite on that door.

Durango: Hold your fire!

[fuse hissing]

Get that damned thing open!

[door rattles]

[explosion booms]

[dramatic music]

What are you
sod busters staring at?

Ride!
We're outta here!

Move it out.
Hyah hyah!

Come on, run!
Let's ride!

They're dead!

Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid are dead.

They're blowed up!

Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid are dead!

[townsfolk chattering]

Lord, they were not good men.

Then again, I guess
they weren't all bad either.

Lord, I don't know what
you're gonna do with them.

And if you can't use them,

I suppose you'll have to
give them to the devil.

Lord have mercy on their
souls, wherever they may be.

Amen.

Can't you leave me alone?

I don't have enough left of
them to bury in a coffee tin.

It's a shame we never
found their bodies.

I heard you lost your job
at the newspaper, Ms. Place.

Yes, the good people

of Rifle, Colorado don't
wanna get their news

from a confederate
of ruthless outlaws.

So I'm moving on.

Where ya headed?

Anywhere but the West.

I'm sick of the killing
and I'm sick of its killers.

I'm going to Philadelphia.

I've got a family
there in civilization.

But I don't understand
you, Mr. Durango.

They said you rode
with Harry and Butch.

You lived with them and
yet you turned on them.

It was my job.

[upbeat music playing]

[donkey braying]

[men speaking Spanish]

[children shouting]

Here ya go, Kid.

[upbeat music]

Well, how do we look?

Like dead men.

How does it feel
to be dead?

It feels like
it's time to start living.

We did it.

Law can't touch us here.

Apparently,
your plan perfectly,

except for the part where I
thought you really were dead,

cried myself dry with grief,
and then being driven

from my home and my job
like a pariah.

Had to spend the last
month on three trains,

a stagecoach, and a horse,

so maybe I'm not ready
to appreciate it.

Is all this for me?

Yeah.

Setting up a big
fiesta for the church.

Whole valley raising money
for a statue of St. Lucia.

It's solid gold.

So what are you two do here?

We keep the banditos
in the hills away.

We're the guards.

Us.
[laughs]

Can you believe it?

Ironic, you had to
travel to another country

to finally go straight.

I am surprised, though.

I thought you two would
be bored to tears by now.

[speaks Spanish]

[soldier shouts in Spanish]

Who's this?

Sergeant Sanchez.

This is the young lady
I was telling you about.

Senorita Place.

[speaking Spanish]

Ahh! [speaking Spanish]

When did you learn
to speak Spanish?

On the train on
the way down here.

Etta's a photographer.

A photographer.

Si.

Perhaps you could
take a photograph of me

and my men sometime.

How 'bout now?

Si.

[speaking Spanish]

Give her time.

Yeah, I'm really, really
happy you came down here.

You didn't give me much
of a choice, did you?

Everything...

everyone I love is here.

I'll make it up to you.

We can start all over.

Harry, I got an inch
of trail dust in my lungs.

Will you be a dear and
get me something to drink?

You're gonna make us
pay, huh?

Mm-hmm.

For what we put you through?

I guess we deserve it.

That and more.

Mr. Sundance.
What is it, little partner?

In the church!
[speaking Spanish]

Pelicans?

[speaking Spanish]

All right, let's...
let's go check it out.

I'll get those pelicans.

[speaking Spanish]

All right.

I'll go see.

Stay there.

Alright, amigos, what's
going on in here?

[guns cock]

Well, how you boys doing?

[priest yelling in Spanish]

[bandit yells in Spanish]
Ahh!

[gunshot and flashbulb snaps]

Hey!

[soldiers yelling]

What's going on?

[speaking Spanish]

What's going on?

Bad men
from the hills, banditos.

Sundance is inside with them.

Boy can't keep his
nose out of trouble.

What?

Oh, all right.

[bandits yelling in Spanish]

You boys ain't never
getting outta here now.

[yelling in Spanish]

Hey, what's y'all
doing in here?

Well, what's the hold-up?
Hold-up?

No, this is more like
a foul-up.

These boys don't have
the first idea

what they're doing.

Not only did they
try to rob the place,

plum in the middle of broad
daylight, with no escape plan,

and the whole town
setting up for a fiesta.

They didn't even
cover their faces.

And on top of that,
they're robbing a church!

Oh!
A church?

Which is just about
as low as a man can go.

I gotta agree.

You boys are a disgrace
to the profession.

Silencio! Aah!

[bandits yelping]

[villagers yelling]

I could have handled
myself, Butch.

Right.

[people shouting]

[villagers cheering]

We didn't get this kind of
reception up in Vicksburg.

That was Grant.

Huh?

You stupid fool.
You're alive.

Well, look who's
finally happy to see us.

Oh, don't get a swelled head.

I'm just glad I didn't end
up stuck out here alone.

Amigos, you know
what you've done?

You saved the lady.

You saved this town!
[villagers cheering]

Everyone will hear
of your great heroism.

That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

Is he dead?
Yup, he's dead.

Come on, let's go.

Thank you, sir.

Saddle up.

Where we going?

[chuckles] Mexico.

I thought we were
going after Elzy Lay.

Yeah, well, not anymore.

We're going after
Butch and Sundance.

You boys got
a problem with that?

Yeah, Charlie, I've
got a problem with that.

Butch and Sundance are dead.

I didn't sign on
the chase ghosts.

They're not ghosts.

[Etta humming]

[gun cocks]

What are you doing?
Um...

[door creaks]

What are you doing here?

Water's still warm
if one of you boys

are looking to use it.

[villagers chatting]

[speaking Spanish]

I think you missed
Philadelphia

by about 3,000 miles,
Ms. Place.

[suspenseful music]

Where we going?

Time for me
to be moving on.

Moving on?

Etta just got here.

Can't stay.

I thought we were
in this together.

Sundance...

I love her.

Hell, I know that.

I ain't blind, amigo.

And I understand,

'cause she doesn't
love you back, right?

Actually, I think
she kind of loves us both.

I don't think so.

She's a complicated woman.

Yeah.

Well then it's good
that you're leaving.

You know I'd never do
anything to hurt you, Kid.

Yeah.

Unh! Get off me!
Unh!

From Senor Durango.

He has her.

I don't need your help.

Yeah you do.

You're right. I do.

Durango.

Sergeant.

That's all.

You and your men are
taking over my town, eh?

-[both chuckle]
Yeah.

What about this reward
money you're offering?

So that's what
you're after, huh?

Tell you what, you just out of
my way like we talked about,

and you get what's
coming to ya, greaser.

[Etta grunting]

I hear the sergeant's
a friend of yours.

Did you hear how neighborly he
got when smelled the dinero?

Right, and you're
doing all this

'cause you believe in it.

More than you know, honey.

[grunt]
You're a pig.

Yeah?

And you're a pretty
little thing, aren't you?

I can see why Butch
and Sundance got you so much.

I'll bite your lips
off if you try anything.

Oh yeah?

Well, I'm not interested
in you... Etta.

I'm just gonna
keep you hogtied

till Butch and
Sundance come for you.

They're dead.

Right. And you've come
to Mexico for the altitude.

It's good
for your asthma, right?

Yeah. Well, they'll come.

They'll come.

They got ten Pinkertons
around the plaza.

Another 20 soldiers moving
in around the building.

What's that,
ten to one, right?

More like 20.

Harry: Could be worse, right?

Look at that stupid yo-yo.

Kid, look, about Etta.

Let's just get her back.

All right, so what do we do?

What we always do.

[Harry chuckles]]

[man grunting]

Get outta here, ya drunk!

Unh! Oh!
Come here!

Butch, guard the door.

What the hell
are you doing here?

We're rescuing you.

It's a trap
in broad daylight.

Will you get outta here?

Don't worry,
we got it all worked out.

Etta: What?

[chickens clucking]

[cup clatters]

Let's just go.

We know what we're doing.
Heh!

[gunshots]
Since when?

Did you think this through?

Of course we did.

Great, I thought
you were outlaws.

Don't you know anything?

All right, all right.

Let's just get outta here.

Well, that might be a problem.

[agents shouting]

[villagers screaming]

[rifles clicking]

Durango: Now don't fire
until I give you the word.

Cassidy, Sundance,
how you doing, boys?

Hey, why don't you come out
and I'll let Etta live.

Tell you what, Durango,

you come in here
and discuss it with us

we might let you live.

[man chuckles]

You had your chance!

[glass shatters]

Steady!

Give me the bullets out
out of those bandoliers.

How could two grown men
be so stupid?

You with your stupid clothes.

You and the stupid way
you eat.

And this stupid country
with its stupid dust

and stupid heat, and...

I feel so stupid for coming
here with the two stupid men

that I love.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I made
you come down here.

You didn't make me
do anything, Harry.

I wanted to come.

If we get out of here,
thing that we talked about.

Yes.

Yes?
I will.

You will?

Yoo-hoo!

Come on, boys!

Etta, I know
it doesn't look good,

but if we make it outta
here I have to know.

Yes.
Yes?

Yes.

Less talking,
more shooting.

Unh!

Nice shot, Etta.

Aah!

Hey, this poster says
50,000 pesos, for our reward,

dead or alive.

You know what?
Let's just rob Durango.

[Etta laughs]

Sergeant Sanchez!

I'm listening, senorita.

Hold your fire.

I wanna talk to you.

I'm coming out.

[Sanchez speaking Spanish]

Hold your fire,
hold your fire!

What are you doing, sergeant?

Senorita wants
to talk... I talk.

What are you doing?

What?

[both speaking Spanish]

What the hell is she saying?

What's she saying?

I dunno

Harry: Well
what's he saying?

Butch: I don't speak Spanish.

Harry: What are they doing?

They're talking.

He just kissed her
on the hand.

You let her go?

What the hell's
going on, Sanchez?

Take off your clothes.
What?

Get your clothes off.
Etta.

Just hold your tongue
and strip.

So, after all this,

you don't intend to
pay the reward, huh?

[Durango chuckles]

[speaking Spanish]

You have ordered me
around for the last time.

[speaking Spanish]

Agent: What the heck
they doing?

Fuego!
-[gunfire]

Unh!

What the hell you say to them?

[Etta laughs]

[men grunting]

[men grunting]

Aah!

El Pinkertons are no longer
with us, mis amigos.

But there's still the matter
of a great reward.

[gun cocks]

[Sanchez speaking Spanish]

[soldier speaking
in foreign language]

This is the last we shall see
of Butch Cassidy

and Sundance the kid.

[flash booms
and villagers cheer]

And the money, the reward,
goes to Santa Lucia.

[all cheering]

[crow cawing]

[horse whinnies]

[dramatic music]

Time to finish
our business, Durango.

Still going on about
Mike Cassidy, huh?

You chose
the outlaw life, Butch.

You guys are gonna end up,
same as you, same as me.

And we just don't know when.

You're lucky.

You know when.

Now.

You're not gonna
shoot me, Butch.

Reach for it.

This here's Wyoming.

I know you swore you wouldn't
commit a crime in Wyoming.

You always keep
your word, Butch.

You're right.


[upbeat music]

You can't stay
in Wyoming forever.

You're right.

I won't.

There will be time later.

Let's move on.

Where to?

Wherever, as long
as it's not boring.

Is that how it's gonna be?

Faking your deaths and moving
on for the rest of our lives?

Been working out so far.

For you, I've already been
to two of your funerals.

We haven't had
a decent one yet.

Well, I'm in no rush
to attend your real one.

Not when I got
my two weddings to plan.

Two?
[laughs]

Try and keep up, boys.

Etta.
Etta, come back here.

Etta Place, just stop
that horse right now.

[conversation continues
indistinctly]

[country western music playing]

[child laughing]
