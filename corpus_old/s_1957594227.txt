(MultiCom Jingle)

(radio chatter)

[Narrator] Radio Moscow said today,

that the final numbers
are in from Stalingrad

and that they are staggering.

Since February 1st, 1943,

the Soviet authorities report

they have removed 147,000 German corpses

and 47,000 Soviet.

(radio chatter)

(inspiring orchestral music)

[Radio Announcer] In
the Solomon Islands,

US Navy planes reportedly
launched round the clock attacks

against Japanese positions.

[Radio Announcer] The first
allied footfall in Europe

comes in Sicily, off the
toe of the boot of Italy,

where British and American
troops under General Alexander,

stormed Europe for the first time.

(radio chatter)

[Radio Announcer] Reports are coming in

of the greatest land battle ever fought.

Two million men--

[Churchill] The weather
been unsuitable over Berlin.

We dropped about 800 tons

last night on Hamburg.

I expect the experience will make them

less keen about war than they used to be.

The big question is,
can we work with Russia?

Now and after the war?

I must admit,

I thought is most primarily in Europe.

The parent continent of the

modern nations and civilizations.

It would be a measureless disaster

if Russian barbarism overlayed
the culture and independence

of the ancient states of Europe.

They will never accept the idea

this whole great space
should be red, never.

Never.

Mr. President.

Hello, sit down, sit down everybody.

I see you have been doing your homework.

(all laugh)

Let's talk it through, shall we?

According to this,

the decisive effort of the war

must be made against the
continent of Europe from England,

sooner or later.

Although, the British
have rendered lip service

to crossing the channel,

their hearts aren't in it.

Their theory is that
Germany can be defeated

by a series of attritions
in Italy, the Mediterranean,

the Balkans, and other
satellite countries,

and the only fighting
that needs to be done,

would be done by Russia.

In light of post-war problems we face,

that attitude towards Russia

seems terribly dangerous.

We are pledged quite as
clearly as Great Britain,

for the opening of a real second front.

But none of these methods
of pin prick warfare

can be counted on to fool Stalin

into the belief that we
are keeping that pledge.

So, put briefly, what you all feel is,

that the time has come

for us to decide that we must assume

the responsibility of leadership

in this great final movement of the war.

A cross channel invasion, yes?

You're correct sir.

Winston has got to be told.

The best way of forcing Germany to fight,

is an invasion across the channel.

[Man] I'll be back in an hour.

Have you noticed

the President is a very tired man?

His mind seems closed.

He's lost his wonderful elasticity.

We can, if we have to,

carry out a cross channel
invasion ourselves.

I'm sure the British would be glad

to make the necessary bases
in England available to us.

300,000 dead British soldiers,
floating in the channel.

I wake up at night

and see the channel
floating with the bodies.

With the cream of our youth.

Keep the Undergrounds open at all times.

I want to send Uncle Joe a telegram

of congratulations on the capture of Orel.

But, since I have heard
nothing from him about

our progress in Sicily,

I have decided to say nothing.

I have just come back from the front,

and I take this opportunity

to congratulate the British government

and Anglo-American troops,

on their highly successful
operations in Sicily,

which have already led
to the fall of Mussolini

and the collapse of his gain.

(telephone ringing)

I have heard from the great bear

and we are on speaking,

or at least growling terms, again.

My dear Marshall Stalin,

may I congratulate you on the tenacity

and drive of your armies.

It is magnificent.

We are now at a crucial time in the war.

A time of setting a unique
chance for a rendezvous.

I have the hope that you, Mr. Churchill,

and myself can meet as soon as possible.

I personally, can come
as far as North Africa.

I too, desire this, as soon as possible.

It would be advisable to select a country

where all three nations are
represented, such as Tehran.

I am delighted with
your willingness to meet.

Personally, my only
hesitation is the place.

Under our constitution, I must
receive and return documents

to congress within 10 days.

Tehran makes this rather a grave risk,

if flying weather is bad.

I hope you will consider Egypt,

which is also a neutral state.

I have no objection to Tehran,

which I think is a more
suitable place than Egypt,

where the Soviet Union
is not yet represented.

The problem of my going to Tehran

is that for constitutional reasons,

I cannot take the risk.

There is a possibility
of meeting at some fort

in the eastern Mediterranean or Baghdad.

Where we can have three comfortable camps,

seeing if worth considering.

My colleagues hold the
front operations necessitate

day to day guidance by
the supreme command.

In Tehran, unlike the other places,

these requirements can
be met by communicating

directly with Moscow by
telegram or telephone.

For this reason, my
colleagues insist on Tehran.

I am deeply disappointed.

I must tell you, I cannot go to Tehran.

I must carry on a
constitutional government

more than 150 years old.

If it were not for this fact,

I would gladly go 10 times
the distance to meet you.

Please do not fail me in this crisis.

[Stalin] The idea has occurred to me

that I could be replaced
at the meeting by Molotov.

In that case, the difficulties of choosing

a place would disappear.

[Roosevelt] You will be glad to know

that I have worked out a method,

whereby if there is a
bill requiring my veto,

I will fly to Tunis to meet,

and then return to conference.

I am therefore decided to go to Tehran

and this makes me especially happy.

I am very glad that the President

is willing to fly to Tehran.

I, myself, have for months past,

declared my willingness
to go anywhere at anytime,

when the three of us can meet together.


Well, we're preparing for
a battle here, at Tehran.

But you'll find us lining
up with the Russians.

Difficulty is not in winning a war.

It is in persuading people
to let you win the war.

Persuading fools.

I feel inclined to say to the Americans,

all right if you won't play
with us in the Mediterranean,

we won't play with you
in the English Channel.

And they will reply all right,

and we will concentrate all
our effort in the Pacific,

and I will reply,

you are welcome to do so,

if you wish.

Ah, Harry,

Mr Molotov.

I was telling the
President Soviet secret

intelligence has uncovered a plot to kill

one or more of the big three in Tehran,

if anything like that were to happen,

it could produce a most
unfortunate impression.

This cannot be denied.

Marshal Stalin therefore urges

you to move to the Soviet embassy.

Please thank the
Marshall for his concern,

and tell him that I accept.

I will be over this afternoon,

when I at last will have the pleasure

of meeting him face to face.

I don't believe there's any plot,

but Stalin wants us over
at the Russian embassy.

I don't know a good
Russian from a bad Russian,

I can tell a good Frenchman
from a bad Frenchman,

and a good Italian from a bad Italian,

I know a good Greek when I see one,

but I don't understand the Russians.

(car engines roaring)

Mister President.

This is a very great occasion for me.

I've been trying a long time
to bring this about that.

I am to blame,

I have been very much occupied
with military matters.

Well I know,

what is the situation on
the Soviet battlefront?

On part of the front not so good,

we are about to lose Kurdistan.

I wish it was within my power to bring

about the removal of 30 or 40

German divisions in the Eastern front,

and this is one of the things I wish

to discuss here in Tehran.

It would be of great value
to us if it could happen.

An additional reason why
I'm glad to be in this house,

is it affords us the opportunity
of meeting more frequently,

in complete informality under
different circumstances.

You have all the time you wish.

Is a prime minister here yet?

He is on the second floor,

this will take us up.

We are sitting around this table

for the first time as a family,

With the one object of winning the war.

We hope to be very successful,

and achieve constructive accord,

in order that we may maintain close

touch throughout the
war and after the war.

Perhaps the Prime Minister
would like to say something?

This is the greatest concentration

of power the world has ever seen,

in our hands is a possible
certainty of shortening the war,

with the absolute certainty that

we hold the happy future of mankind,

I pray we may be worthy of
this remarkable opportunity,

granted to us by God.

The opportunity of serving mankind.

Perhaps our host would
like to say a few words?

History has given us big
forces and great opportunities,

now let us get down to business.

Let us begin with the Pacific,

where America is bearing
a major part of the war.

We are sinking many Japanese ships,

both naval and merchant,

more than they could possibly replace,

we've been moving toward Japan
from the south and the east,

it is necessary for us
to keep China in the war,

so we have arranged plans for operations

through North Burma,

now this whole operation
covers a huge territory,

and large numbers of ships and men

and planes are necessary to carry it out,

now as to the operations which are

of immediate concern to
the USSR and Great Britain,

not only do we want to get across,

but we intend to proceed
inland into Germany,

now it would be impossible
to launch such an operation,

before May 1, 1944,

the channel is such a
disagreeable body of water,

we cannot do everything
we would like to do,

in the Mediterranean and
out of the United Kingdom,

we should like to have the
advice of our Soviet friends,

as to how we could best
ease their position.

There are no differences between

Great Britain and the United States,

except as regards ways and means.

The USSR believes that operations

in Italy are of no great value,

a more suitable sector for a blow

at Germany is from northern France,

but it must be expected that the Germans

will fight like devils to
prevent such an attack.

We have long agreed that an invasion

of France across the Channel
should be undertaken,

and we are resolved to do so in 1944,

however,

it is ask now what can
be done in the meantime,

that would be of more use and
take more weight off Russia,

possibly without delaying
Overlord more than a month or two,

if the Anglo-American troops take Rome,

then they are left two choices,

one,

keep proceeding to southern France,

and two,

go eastward across the Adriatic.

It is not worthwhile to scatter

the British and American forces,

crossing the Channel
Overlord should be in 1944,

other operations should be
considered as diversionary.

This is of considerable interest to me.

Our experience has convinced us that

a large offensive from
one direction is unwise,

we usually attack from two directions,

forcing the enemy to move his reserves

from one front to the other,

as the two offenses converge,

the power of the whole
offensive increases.

I think it would be a good idea for

the staff to immediately conduct

a study of the operations
against southern France,

shall we break for a few minutes,

give them a chance to get
started on organizing that now?

Has anything gone wrong,

a bloody lot has gone wrong.

I will not allow the great campaign

in Italy to be cast aside,

and end in frightful disaster.

Stalin ought to be told bluntly,

Overlord might have to be postponed.

Churchill likes to take the easy road,

and leaves the difficult
job to the Russians.

Stalin seems obsessed
with the second front,

I can be obstinate too,

damn the fellow.

Franklin,

might you and I have lunch alone

before our next meeting with uncle Joe?

I don't think so Winston.

It's not like him Harry.

The President doesn't want Stalin

to get the impression that you two

are putting your heads together,

hatching your own schemes.

I can accept he bluffs
as well as the next man.

Harry.

Sir?

One thing I will insist on,

that I am host for
dinner tomorrow evening,

to begin with I come first in
seniority and alphabetically,

in the second place,

I represent the longest established

of the three governments,

and in the third place,

tomorrow happens to be my birthday.

There might be a more bloody war,

I shall not be there,

I shall be asleep.

I want to sleep for billions of years,

when I consider the vast issues,

I realize just how inadequate we are,

I believe,

man might destroy man,

and wipe out civilization,

Europe would be desolate,

and I may be held responsible.

Stupendous issues are
unfolding before our eyes,

and we are only specks of dust,

that have settled on the night,

on the map of the world.

Why do I plague my mind with such things?

I never used to worry about anything.

(crowd murmuring)

I'm sure we'll hit it off,

Stalin and I,

as for uncle Joe and Winston,

I'll have my work cut out
for me between those two.

Who will command operation Overlord?

It's not yet been decided.

In that case nothing
will come of Overlord.

I would like to say
I am a little concerned

at the number and complexity of

the problems before this conference,

the British staff and I have given

long thought to the Mediterranean theater,

we are most anxious to have
the armies there fight,

all I want is landing
craft for two divisions,

this cannot be supplied without

delaying Overlord six to eight weeks.

Overlord is the most
important operation,

nothing should be done to
distract attention from that.

I want to see Overlord
undertaken in May 1944.

I insist on knowing the date for Overlord.

There's no decisive
difference in principle--

I want to ask Mister Churchill
an indiscreet question,

do the British really believe in Overlord,

or are they only saying so
to reassure the Russians?

(crowd murmuring)

Provided the conditions
previously stated

for Overlord are established
when the time comes,

it will be our stern duty to hurl across

the channel against the Germans
every sinew of our strength.

(crowd murmuring)

Nothing more can be done here.

Would it be possible for us to discuss

the question of Poland?

Nothing you have said so far makes

me want to discuss the question.

I have no power from parliament,

for I believe is it prescient
to define any frontiers,

but we might now we're all here,

see if the three of us can form some

sort of policy we can recommend

to the Poles to advise and to accept?

Do you think we want
to swallow Poland up?

We don't know how much
you're going to eat,

we believe God is on our side,

at least I have done my best
to make him a faithful ally.

And the devil is on my side?

Because everybody knows that
the devil is a Communist.

And God of course is a
good Conservative (laughs).

(Iranian religious music)

The way to kill the most Germans

with the least loss of American soldiers,

is to mount one great big invasion

and slam them with everything we've got.

Make sense to me,

makes sense to uncle Joe,

it's the quickest way to
win the war that's all.

The trouble is the Prime Minister

is he's thinking too
much about the post-war,

and where England will be.

He's scared of letting the
Russians get too strong.

Well maybe the Russians
will be strong in Europe,

whether that's a bad thing,

depends on a whole lot of factors.

I've got to do something to establish

better relations with Stalin.

(crowd laughing)

Winston,

I hope you won't be sore at
me for what I'm going to do.

Look at old John Bull over there,

you know if he were in a blanket

blowing those smoke signals,

we'd call him an Indian,

well not John Bull,

but Chief Sitting Bull.

(crowd laugh)

Of course Marshall Stalin,

you will understand that any time

you mention the word
Indian to an Englishman,

all he wants is to expand
the beloved empire.

(crowd laugh)

Now we can't have that,

can we?

I propose a toast to
Mister Winston Churchill,

who nurses a secret affection for Germany,

to Churchill,

who wishes to see a soft
peace for the Germans.

Just because the Russians
are a simple people,

it is a mistake to believe they are blind,

and cannot see what is before them,

you are pro-German,

to make sure that Germany will not

rise again in 15 or 20 years to plunge

the world into another war,

50,000 of their officers,

must be rounded up and shot.

(crowd applauds)

The British Parliament and public

would never tolerate such mass executions.

50,000 must be shot.

I would rather be taken out
into the garden here and now,

and be shot myself,

than sully my own and my
country's honor by such infamy.

I have a compromise to propose,

not 50,000 should be shot,

but only 49,000.

(crowd laugh)

We were playing with you.

Where is your sense of humor?

Someday,

I would like to visit your front,

I am in my 70th year.

Don't boast,

I am only four years younger than you.

Winston,

you're fighting a losing battle

in trying to delay the invasion of France,

there's really nothing you
can do but lose with grace.

(crowd murmuring)

(glass clinks)

(murmuring stops)

Operation Overlord,

will be started in May 1944,

it will be supported by an operation

against southern France.

Hear, hear.

(crowd applaud)

I want to call Mister
Churchill my friend.

Call me Winston,

I call you Joe behind your back.

I want to call you my friend,

I want to be allowed to
call you my good friend.

I lift my glass to Winston Churchill,

for whom I have long had
the greatest admiration.

To my fighting friend Churchill.

(crowd applauds)

I wish to propose a toast,

to Marshall Stalin,

who is worthy to stand with

the great figures of Russian history,

and merits the title,

Stalin the Great.

[Man] Hear, hear.

(crowd applauds)

It's easy to be a great leader,

when one has to deal with
people such as the Russians,

the Russian people tolerate
no less from their army,

even people of medium courage,

even cowards become heroes
in the Soviet Union,

in Russia it is dangerous to be a coward.

I drink to the proletarian masses.

I drink to the Conservative party.

(crowd laugh)

To our unity,

war and peace.

[All Together] War and peace.

War and peace.

(glass clinks)

I would like the privilege
of adding the last word,

these meetings at Tehran
have raised all our hopes

that the future will find a better world,

in our country,

the rainbow is the symbol
of good fortune and hope,

as we prepare to leave
this historic gathering,

we remember we saw today in
the sky for the first time,

that traditional symbol of hope,

the rainbow.

(all applaud)

When this war is over,

as a reward,

his Majesty's government would like

to bestow on you a noble title.

Membership in the House of Lords

is one reward I do not covet.

The title is already selected,

you will be named Lord root of the matter.

(both laugh)

We've got our differences,

but no one could have a better

or sturdier ally than that old Tory.

Stalin is get-at-able.

Roosevelt has given his word

that large-scale action will
be mounted in France in 1944,

I believe that he will keep his word,

but even if he doesn't,

we have enough forces of our
own to destroy Nazi Germany.

(dramatic military music)

[Narrator] In England,

the long and eagerly awaited invasion

of the continent of Europe
continues to take shape,

as hundreds of thousands of men make final

preparations under the watchful
eye of General Eisenhower,

the 64,000 dollar question
the whole world is asking,

and Herr Hitler in particular is dying

to know the answers to,

where and when.

Marshall Stalin,

the general crossing of
the channel will take place

on May 31st,

the date might be shifted two or three

days one way or the other,

depending on weather and tide.

I'm confident that
Overlord will be a success,

as agreed in Tehran,

the Red Army will launch a new
offensive at the same time,

so as to give maximum support

to the Anglo-American operations.

(dramatic military music)

If Overlord fails,

the United States will have lost a battle,

but for us it will mean the
end of our military capability.

Some people think that because

we are the allies of the English,

we have forgotten who they
are and who Churchill is,

the English find nothing sweeter
than to prick their allies,

Churchill is the kind of
man if you don't watch him,

he'll slip a kopek out of your pocket,

yes by God a kopek,

and Roosevelt,

Roosevelt he's not like that,

he'll only dip his hands
in for bigger coins.

But Churchill,

even for a kopek.

(dramatic military music)

Get me Mrs Roosevelt please.

I have hung very much upon
this operation Overlord,

and I am in this thing
with you to the end,

if it fails,

we shall go down together.

Babs,

now I can tell you,

tomorrow is D-Day.

no I won't be able to sleep either.

Clemmie,

do you realize by the time
you wake up in the morning,

20,000 men may have been killed.

Yes, there will be a landing,

if there is no problem,

up until now there was always
something that interfered.

Tomorrow there will be something else,

maybe they'll meet some Germans,

what if they meet up with some Germans,

maybe there'll be no landing then,

just promises as usual.

No,

this time it will really be so.

(dramatic military music)

[Announcer] Soldiers, crews and airmen,

you are about to embark
upon a great Crusade,

towards which we have
striven these many months,

the eyes of the world are upon you,

the hopes and prayers of liberty
loving people everywhere,

March with you.

[Narrator] Almighty God,

our sons,

pride of our nation,

this day have set upon a mighty endeavor,

to struggle to preserve our republic,

our religion, our civilization,

and to set free the suffering humanity.

[Announcer] This is the
day and this is the hour,

the sky is lightning,

lightning over the coast
of Europe as we go in,

the sun is blazing down brightly now,

it's almost like an omen the way

it suddenly came out
just as we were going in,

the whole sky is bright,

the sea is a quivering mass of silver.

Between the two pilots of his fighter,

I can see the navigation
lights of the target

mothership, and also the left and right,

[Narrator] The paratroops are landing,

they're landing around me as I speak,

and they're toppling down,

red, white and blue parachutes.

[Narrator] Particularly severe weapons

and the German AK-AK defenses,

and flak has been going up all around us,

I can hear that mortar fire
coming in through the--

[Narrator] All laden up
with equipment so heavily,

that they can barely walk,

but they've got to carry with them

the means by which They can
fight with them as they land.

(repeated loud bangs)

(airplane engines rumble)

(multiple explosions and guns firing)

(airplane engines rumbling)

It appears that the landing plans

on a tremendous scale has
been crowned with success,

I and my colleagues cannot but recognize

that this is an enterprise

unprecedented in military history,

Hitler the hysteric who for two years

boasted that he would cross the channel,

did not venture even to make an attempt,

none but our allies has been able

to fulfill with flying colors

the grand plan for crossing the channel,

history will record this as
a feat of the highest order.

Papers should be drafted setting forth

the conditions between us
and the Soviet government,

which are developing in Italy,

in Romania,

in Bulgaria,

in Yugoslavia,

and above all in Greece,

the issue is are we going to acquiesce

in communisation of the Balkans,

and perhaps of Italy,

if the conclusion is that we resist

the communist infusion and invasion,

we should put it to them plainly.

Do you think Marshall Stalin,

the Soviet government might leave

Britain to manage the situation in Greece,

while fighting is still going on there,

and that Great Britain might
leave the situation in Romania

to the Soviet government
during the fighting there.

My government agrees
with the suggestion,

but before giving any final assurance,

we would like to know whether

you have consulted the United States.

In our opinion this arrangement would

certainly resolve the differences

between you and the Soviets,

and the division of the Balkan

area into spheres of influence.

I think I should tell you frankly Winston,

that we were disturbed that your people

took this up with this only after

it was brought to the Russians,

and they inquired whether
we were agreeable.

I propose to the Russians

a temporary working arrangement

for the better conduct of the war,

I cannot admit that I have done

anything wrong in this matter.

The question remains,

what should our forces
in the Mediterranean do?

General Eisenhower naturally
wants to strengthen his attack

in north-west Europe
by all available means,

northern Italy does not attract him,

Southern France does,

our first wish is to help Eisenhower,

we do not think this necessarily involves

the complete ruin of all our great

affairs in the Mediterranean.

We take it hard that this
should be demanded of us.

Use of the Mediterranean resources

to advance on northern Italy
is not acceptable to me.

Let us resolve not to wreck
one great campaign in Italy,

for the sake of another in France,

both can be won.

Perhaps so,

but I am mindful of our
agreement with Stalin,

and his view classifying
operations in the Mediterranean

as of lesser importance.

I don't know what Stalin would say

if the issue was put to him to decide,

it is better to settle
the matter for ourselves,

political considerations
are an important factor.

Important,

but definitely secondary to the primary

operation of striking
at the heart of Germany.

What can I do Mister President,

when your chiefs of staff insist

on casting aside our
Italian offensive campaign,

with all its dazzling possibilities.

In Tehran,

we agreed on a definite plan of attack,

my dear friend,

I beg you let us go ahead with our plan,

I honestly believe that
God will be with us,

as he was in Overlord,

and Italy and in North Africa.

The Americans are bullying us.

We have a big strong dominating partner,

not one who sees our point of view.

Good God,

now they say that the Russians

are spreading across Europe like a tide,

they have invaded Poland,

there's nothing to prevent them

from marching into Turkey and Greece.

Harry,

I distinctly remember ordering
you to take the day off.

This cable's coming in
from Harriman in Moscow,

I told him to bring the rest up

as soon as they get it decoded,

now that the end of the war is in sight,

our relations with the Soviets
have taken a startling turn,

they've held up our request
with complete indifference,

and have shown unwillingness

even to discuss pressing problems,

the Soviet's indifference to world

opinion regarding their
unbending policy towards Poland,

is best described by Molotov statement,

that the Russians judge their friends

by those that accept the Soviet position,

the general attitude seems to be that

is our obligation to help
Russia and accept her policies,

because she has won the war for us,

they have misinterpreted our generous

attitude towards them as a sign

of weakness and acceptance
of their policies.

The time has come,

we must make clear what
we expect from them,

as the price of our goodwill,

unless we take issue
with the present policy,

there is every indication that

the Soviet Union will
become a world bully.

Whenever her interests are involved.

There are two kinds of people,

those who believe that we must
cooperate with the Russians,

and trust Russia for
the peace of the world,

and those who agree with Winston,

when he says what are we going to have,

between the white snows of Russia

and the White Cliffs of Dover.

I belong to the cooperation
and trust school.

Red Army,

Red Army,

once they get into our country

it's not going to be easy to get them out,

Stalin will take what he wants,

the Americans have seen to that.

If I could only win Stalin's friendship,

after all it's stupid for the President

to suppose that he's the only
person that can handle him,

I talk to him quite easily,

one human being to another,

I thought Stalin would be sensible,

I'm going to Moscow.

Winston,

it would be my hope that no meeting

would be held until we all get together,

but I'll consider your talks as merely

preliminary to a conference
of all three of us.

Of course.

I want to tell you why
I've come to Moscow,

the President and I have been
like brothers in this war,

but I don't want the Russians to feel

that this is just an Anglo-Saxon affair,

I want you to know it is the three of us,

we can settle everything we
three if we come together,

if we do not,

it will mean years of
diplomatic wrangling,

and suspicion,

I would like to begin with
the most tiresome question,

Poland.

You recognize those that call Warsaw Poles

as having a legitimate claim

to be the government of a restored Poland,

we and the Americans believe
those we call the London Poles,

should be the government,

as we feel they more represent

the wishes of the Polish people,

we should have a common policy,

at present each of us has
a gamecock in his hand.

It would be difficult
without a gamecock,

they are the morning signal.

The difficulty about the Poles

is they have unwise political leaders,

Where there are two Poles
there is one quarrel.

Where there is one Pole he begins

to quarrel with himself
through sheer boredom.

The leader of the London Poles

is a peasant and very obstinate.

I am a peasant too.

You can be as obstinate as any of them.

We'll bring pressure on the Polish

government in exile in London,

the Poles here,

the Warsaw Poles are of course

already in agreement with you.

Now let us settle about
our affairs in the Balkans,

Don't let us get at cross
purposes in small ways.

As far as Britain and
Russia are concerned,

how would it do for you to have

90 percent dominance in Romania?

We do have 90 percent in Greece,

in accord with the Americans,

50 50, Yugoslavia and Hungary,

in Bulgaria you would have 75 percent,

we would have 25 percent.

We have a particular interest in Greece,

just as you do in Romania,

we must be the leading
Mediterranean power,

it's a serious matter for Britain

when the Mediterranean
route is not in her hands.

Britain should have
the first say in Greece.

It is better to express these
things in diplomatic terms,

and not use the phrase
dividing into spheres,

because the Americans might be shocked,

but as long as you and I
can understand each other,

I can explain matters to the President.

Might it not be thought rather cynical,

if it seemed we had
disposed of these issues,

so fateful to millions of people,

in such an offhand manner.

Let us just burn the paper.

No,

you keep it.

I feel very deeply the responsibility

which lays on me trying to frame

proposals for a Russian Polish settlement.

Poland is fortunate that
I have not asked for more,

you know we don't intend to make

Poland a communist state after the war,

Communism does not fit to Poles,

they are too nationalistic,

too individualistic,

Poland's future should be
based on private enterprise.

Poland will be a capitalist state.

Russia really has no wish to
convert the world to communism,

as many people fear.

We Russians are not as
clever as you think,

we are simple,

rather stupid,

no one in Europe could be persuaded

that England is either simple or stupid.

I do not speak much,

but drinking loosens the tongue,

I am a rough man,

and not much good at compliments.

After all,

as I always tell the House of Commons,

it's you Russians who have torn

the guts out of the foul Hun.

Guts is the word.

I'm glad now that I did not kill

you back in 1919 when I
opposed the Russian Revolution,

and hope you are glad you did not kill me.

There is a Russian proverb,

a man's eyes should be torn out

if he can only see the past.

I must say,

I greatly covet that man's good will.

Stalin looks much older than Tehran,

he's not a good color,

ashen,

yes that's it,

if anything should happen to
him it would be a catastrophe,

when this fellow goes,

we don't know what will happen to Europe,

it may be a lot of trouble.

I'm sure that the
progress made in Moscow,

will facilitate the work
of our next meeting,

when all three of us should
reach full agreement,

I'm thinking of the
practicality of Cyprus,

Athens,

or Malta.

If the idea of our meeting on the

Soviet Black Sea appears
acceptable to you,

I would consider it very desirable.

The Black Sea.

Doc McIntyre says all sorts
of diseases are rampant there,

dysentery to the bubonic plague.

Since my doctors do not recommend that

I take any great trips
at the present time,

I have to give consideration to them.

His doctors don't want
to make any big trips.

Herman told Stalin that he hoped

either the doctors would
change their minds,

or Stalin would change doctors.

I consider the Black
Sea out of the question,

I am somewhat attracted to
the suggestion of Jerusalem.

I don't think there's any chance

he will agree to Jerusalem.

I think we ought to put
the proposition to uncle Joe,

it's on him the onus of refusing,

after all, we are respectable people too.

Marshal Stalin,

my navy people recommend
strongly against the Black Sea.

I greatly regret that.

Mister President,

there's not a chance of getting

Stalin out of Russia at this time,

we might as well make up
our minds to go to Russia.

I suggest Yalta.

On the Black Sea in the Crimea.

I am prepared to go to Yalta,

we will arrive by plane from
some Mediterranean port.

Malta,

Malta, Yalta.

No more let us falter from Malta to Yalta,

let nobody alter,

if we had spent 10 years on research,

we could not have found
a worse place than Yalta,

but I feel like I can survive it,

by bringing an adequate
adequate supply of whiskey.

It's good for typhus,

and deadly on lice,

which thrive in those parts.

Franklin, would it be
possible for you to spend

two or three nights at Malta,

and let the staff have a talk
together less ostentatiously.

The Russians are inordinately

suspicious of any meetings
between Churchill and me,

and that includes secret
meetings of the staff.

With favorable weather conditions

we could be in Malta on February 2nd,

but it will be necessary to proceed

to Yalta by air the same day in order

to meet our date with uncle Joe.

What are your ideas of the
length of our stay at Yalta?

This may well be a fateful conference,

coming at a moment when the great

allies are so divided.

No more than five or six days.

I do not see any way of realizing

our hopes about world
organization in five or six days.

Even the Almighty took seven.

I am personally fond of Winston.

As we are unable to meet before Yalta,

I feel that the time
has come for me to place

before you a serious and disappointing

war situation which faces
us at the close of 1944.

We have not yet reached the Rhine,

and we shall have to continue

the great battle many weeks

before we can establish our bridge heads,

after that we have to
advance through to Germany.

I have always felt that the occupation

of Germany would be a very stiff job,

because in the old days I bicycled

over most of the Rhine terrain,

I've never been as optimistic

as to the ease of
getting across the Rhine,

as many of our people.

It's also clear,

we have to face a marked
degree of frustration in Italy,

the escape home of a large part

of the German forces from the Balkans,

frustration in Burma,

elimination of China as a combatant,

the question very definitely arises,

what are we going to do about it?

Perhaps I'm not close enough

to the picture to feel as

disappointed with the
war situation as you are,

you and I are now in the
position of commanders in chief,

who have prepared their plans,

issued their orders,

and committed their resources to battle,

I still can't see clearly just when,

but soon a decisive break in
our favor is about to come.

I am personally fond of Winston,

but I am finding him to be
dangerous and excitable.

Marshal Stalin,

the military situation in Belgium,

is not bad.

(dramatic military music)

Fire!

Marshal Stalin,

the Battle of the Bulge is very heavy,

and I should be grateful if you could

tell me whether we can count
on a major Russian offensive,

I regard the matter as urgent.

The weather is at present unfavorable,

nevertheless taking into account
the position of our allies,

we will commence large-scale operations

against the Germans along
the whole central front.

I am most grateful to you.

It would be foolish of me to stand

aside and let the Germans annihilate you,

it would only turn back on me,

when you were disposed of.

Continue.

Make no mistake,

all of the Balkans except Greece

are going to be Bolshivised,

and there is nothing I
can do to prevent it,

there's nothing I can do
for poor Poland either,

best wishes for this new disgusting era.

There's probably more suffering
on humanity as of this hour,

than ever before in history,

as I look out on the world,

it is one of sorrow and bloodshed,

the only hope for the world is

the agreement of the great powers,

if they quarrel,

our children are undone.

I have high hopes for
the meetings here at Yalta,

I hope to make real progress

in strengthening the personal

relationship between myself and Stalin,

Winston.

My dear friend.

Harry.

How was your journey?

I slept 10 hours a night
on the sea voyage to Malta,

but I still don't feel slept out.

Yes I'm tired,

so would you be if you spent the last

five years pushing Winston
uphill in a wheelbarrow.

I hope everything had been
done to make you comfortable?

Absolutely,

I'm just delighted to see you.

Mister Hopkins,

please.

I must say the military situation

has improved considerably
since we last met.

The President looks frail and ill,

transparent almost,

he's very friendly.

Stalin must realize people in England

while keen on relations with Russia

are most worried over Poland,

we can't agree that Poland should

be a mere puppet state of Russia,

where the people who don't agree
with Stalin are bumped off,

the Americans are profoundly
ignorant of the Polish problem.

(glass clinking)

Welcome Russian friends to the Crimea,

as host I have the right to
name the presiding officer,

and that will be Franklin D Roosevelt.

I am honored to begin
this great conference,

I know that while we are here in Yalta,

we will cover the map of the world,

but today I think that military questions,

particularly those on the
most important front of all,

the Eastern front,

should be the subject of discussions,

I want to say first of all Marshal Stalin,

I doubt whether the Soviet people

were any more thrilled than the Americans,

and the British when your armies
crossed over into Germany.

(people drum on table)

We are advancing on
a 700 kilometer front,

45 German divisions have been routed,

100,000 prisoners,

300,000 killed,

total 400,000.

The Germans have already
moved to the Eastern front,

16 divisions,

we therefore wish you to start

an offensive for which the
situation is now very favorable.

Are there any questions?

I have several,

whether we could be more help

to you reinforcing the Western front,

or by moving through the
Balkans to join up with you,

the staff can deal with
the military questions,

while we deal with the political ones,

the whole world will have
its eyes on this conference,

if it is successful,

we will have peace for a hundred years,

only the great powers
who have fought the war

and shed the blood can make the peace.

The three great powers who have

borne the brunt of the war,

and liberated the small countries,

should have the unanimous right

to preserve the peace of the world.

It is ridiculous to believe
that a small country,

Albania for example should
have an equal voice with us.

I agree that we necessarily bear

the major responsibility for the peace,

but I also think that is it essential

to exercise this power with respect

for the rights of the smaller nations.

Yugoslavia,

Albania and such small countries

do not deserve to be at this table,

do you want Albania to have the same

rights as the United States?

There is no question of the small

powers dictating to the big powers,

but great nations should discharge

their moral responsibility with great

respect to the rights of smaller nations,

the eagle should permit
the small bird to sing,

and care not wherefore they sang.

The whole problem of dealing
with the smaller powers,

is not so simple,

we have for instance
lots of Poles in America,

who are vitally interested
in the future of Poland.

But of your 7 million Poles in America,

only 7000 vote.

I know I'm right,

I looked it up.

I feel the conference should proceed

to the consideration of
the United States proposal,

in regard to the new world organization

to be called United Nations.

On December 5th,

I sent you both a proposal calling

for the unanimity of the four permanent

members of the Security Council

in all decisions relating
to a threat to the peace,

we also feel that any member state

should have the right
to state its own case,

I find the proposals
entirely satisfactory,

the British government would consider

they were committing an injustice,

if reservation were not made in the

United Nations organization for

free statement of small countries.

The matter looks as though the three

great powers are trying to rule the world,

whereas our desires are to save

it from the repetition of
the horrors of this war.

I would like to ask Mister Churchill

for further clarification of what powers

he has in mind when he speaks
of a desire to rule the world

who is contemplating such a domination?

May I answer?

In a minute,

is that the United States,

no it is not thinking of such domination,

people laugh)

is it Britain,

no once again it is not Britain,

these two great powers
are beyond suspicion,

that leaves the third,

the USSR,

so it is the USSR that is
driving for world domination?

(all laugh)

it is clear that talk of driving for

world domination is pointless,

my friend Churchill cannot name a single

power that wants to dominate the world,

I will study the proposals,

we are interested in decisions,

not discussions.

(people murmuring)

Stalin can't be much interested

in a world peace organization
like the United Nations,

if two months after you
sent in the proposal,

he hasn't even read it.

A good beginning,

there's one thing I want to tell you,

the Prime Minister and I have been

cabling back and forth for years now,

and we have a term for
which we refer to you,

that's uncle Joe.

What do you mean?

It's a term of endearment,

as if you're a member of the family.

I think I will leave now.

He's just pulling your leg,

he has known this for years,

all of Russia knows
you call him uncle Joe.

The Prime Minister
rises late in the morning,

don't you Winston?

Yes.

And then works hard until mid-afternoon,

sleeps before dinner,

and then he's up half the night talking.

What's your schedule?

I work until five in the morning,

so do all my admirals and generals,

I sleep until 10 in the morning,

not so easy in life,

I do it seven days a week,

small birds better be
careful where they sing.

Before our next meeting,

I hope you will side with us in demanding

not less than an independent
coalition government in Poland,

and free elections?

Something will have to be done,

good night Winston.

And there are times when a long

distance point of view is useful,

my own view is that in
general like Marshal Stalin,

I favor the Curzon line,

the most important question

is that of a permanent
government for Poland.

Now opinion in the United States

is against recognition
of the Warsaw Poles,

that you support Marshal
Stalin on the grounds

that they represent a small
portion of the Polish people,

what the people want is a
government of national unity,

that would represent
all the major parties.

I want to see the Poles have a home

where they can organize
their lives as they wish,

it must not be forgotten
that Great Britain

went to war to protect Poland
against German aggression,

at a time when because
of our unpreparedness,

that decision was most risky,

it almost cost us our life as a nation,

the question is one of honor,

because we drew the sword for Poland

against Hitler's brutal attack,

my government will
therefore never be content

with a solution which does not

leave Poland a free and independent state.

Mister Churchill has said
that for Great Britain,

the question of Poland is one of honor.

I can understand that,

for Russians Poland is not
only a question of honor,

but of security.

The point is,

throughout history Poland was a corridor

for enemies to attack Russia,

in the last 30 years,

Germany has twice passed
through this corridor easily,

why were they able to do this?

Because Poland was so weak,

Russia wants a strong independent
and democratic Poland,

why,

because it is impossible for Russia's

forces alone to close this
corridor from the outside.

It has to be done from the inside,

by Poland's own forces,

that is why we want a strong
and independent Poland.

Because Poland is a question
of life and death for us.

As to the question of
the Polish government,

it will be difficult to
bring all the Poles together,

the Poles we support,

the Warsaw Poles,

won't even talk about
the fusion government

to the London Poles,

I am prepared to support any attempt

that would offer some chance of success.

What is to be done?

I wish to thank Marshal
Stalin for his remarks,

we have different sources of information,

perhaps I am mistaken,

but I doubt the Warsaw Poles represent

even one third of the Polish people,

I do not believe it would be maintained

in power if the people
were free to express

their opinion, I fear
collisions, I fear bloodshed,

arrests,

deportation,

I fear the effect on the
whole Polish question.

The Polish question has been giving

the world a headache for five centuries.

(crowd murmuring)

The long meetings are really Winston's

fault because he makes so many speeches.

There are good speeches though,

Winston doesn't make any other kind.

Surely there is a way to reconcile

our differences on Poland?

You must believe me Marshal Stalin

that our people at home say,

if we cannot get a
meeting of the minds now,

when our armies are converging
on the common enemy,

how can we get an understanding

on even more vital things in the future?

Mister Molotov has worked out some

proposals on the Polish question,

but first I suggest that we proceed

to the question of voting
in the United Nations.

I will ask Mister Molotov to state

the views of the Soviet government.

We have explanations of the President's

proposals for voting
in the United Nations.

The Soviet government fears these

proposals fully guarantee the unity of

the great powers and the
preservation of the peace,

therefore they are entirely acceptable,

and there is full
agreement on the subject.

This is a great step forward,

which will be welcomed by
all the people of the world.

I would like to express my heartfelt

thanks to Marshal Stalin
and Mister Molotov

for this enormous step.

We are now ready with the following

proposals on the Polish question.

First the Curzon line
should be the Eastern

frontier of Poland,

second as to the Warsaw Polish government

some Democratic leaders from
the Polish service abroad.

third,

the enlarged Polish government should

as soon as possible call
the population to the Polls

for organization of a
permanent government.

I feel these proposals go far toward

meeting the President's wishes.

I,

I feel that progress has been made,

but I should like the opportunity
to study these proposals.

Yes certainly.

I agree with the President,

it would be well to think
more on this problem,

but I do feel some progress has been made.

Good,

tonight you will all be
my guests at a banquet.

(people murmuring)

The most important thing is to maintain

unity of the three great powers,

to defeat Germany and Japan,

and then we get around the table

and organize the United Nations.

In an alliance,

the Allies should not deceive each other,

perhaps that is naive,

but then I as a naive man,

think it is best not to deceive my ally.

Even if he is a fool.

Perhaps our alliance is so firm,

just because we do not deceive each other.

Or is it all because it is not so

easy to deceive each other.

(all laugh)

I am talking as an old man,

that's why I am talking so much.

(all laugh)

But I want to drink to our alliance,

it should not lose its
character of intimacy.

[All Together] Peace.

(glasses clinking)

This is the crucial
point of the conference,

we take different views
about basic facts in Poland,

according to British information,

provisional Warsaw government

does not commend itself to the great

majority of the Polish people,

and we cannot feel that it would

be accepted abroad as representing them.

Now we're going to
hear from old stoneass.

The Soviet delegation
is extremely anxious

to come to an agreement on Poland.

We propose the following wording.

The present provisional government

in Warsaw should be reorganized on a wider

democratic basis with the
inclusion of democratic leaders,

living abroad.

I'm glad to see that an advance

has been made, there is an
atmosphere of agreement,

there is also a desire to put foot

in the stirrup and be off.

These might well be the most
important days of our lives,

I have to give the House of Commons

real assurances that free
elections will be held.

I do not care much about Poles myself.

There are good men among the Poles,

in earlier times many
of them were scientists,

they are brave fighters,

the Polish have produced
some outstanding artists.

And this reorganized government

shall be pledged to holding free

elections as soon as possible.

I want this election in
Poland to be beyond question,

to be like Caesar's wife,

I did not know her but
they said she was pure.

That's what they said,

but she had her sins.

Can we add an exchange of ambassadors

who will keep us informed
about the situation in Poland?

Agreed.

I want a hot bath,

a good soak.

If I had known how
tired the President is,

I would have agreed to meet
along the Mediterranean.

It all now depends upon the spirit

on which his agreements are carried out.

Admiral Leahy says this is so elastic,

the Russians can stretch it from Yalta

to Washington without ever breaking.

I know, it's the best I can
do for Poland at this time.

[Harry] We really believed in our hearts

that this was the dawn of a new day

we had been talking about and
praying for for so many years,

we were absolutely certain we'd won

the first great victory of the peace,

and by we I mean the whole
civilized human race.

The Russians had proved they could

be reasonable and farseeing,

and there's no doubt in the mind

of the President or any of us,

we could live with them peacefully

as far into the future as
any of us could imagine.

You know I was 28 years old
when I entered political life,

but even at that time Winston had

had long experience in the
service of his country.

I face difficult elections
in England in the near future.

Everybody knows they need a leader,

what better leader than
he who won the victory?

I shall have to speak very
harshly about the Communists.

The Communists are the good boys.

We are against them,

and we shall have to make our case,

you know we have two parties,

you have only one,

a much easier job of it,

you have only one party.

Experience has shown that one party

is of great convenience
to a leader of state.

Mister President.

Prime Minister.

Thank you.

(people murmuring)

I understand Stalin,

and he understands me.

Poor Neville Chamberlain,

to believe he could trust Hitler,

he was wrong,

I don't think I'm wrong about Stalin.

Franklin has such a
slender contact on life.

Peace with Germany and Japan.

On our terms,

will not bring much rest to you and me,

if I'm still responsible.

When the war of the giants is over,

the war of the pygmies will begin,

it will be a torn,

ragged and hungry world help to its feet,

and what will uncle Joe or his successor

say to the way we should
should both like to do it?

Now that Harry is ill,

my poor friend is very much alone,

and according to all accounts I received,

bereft of much of his vigor.

The work my friends,

is peace,

more than the end of this war,

the end of the beginning of all wars,

yes the end forever of this impractical,

unrealistic settlement and the differences

between governments by the
mass killing of peoples.

And to you,

and to all Americans
who dedicate themselves

with us to the making of an abiding peace,

I say the only limit to our
realization of tomorrow,

is our doubts of today,

let us move forward,

with strong and active faith.

I have a terrific headache.

(train whistle blows)

[Churchill] In Franklin Roosevelt,

there died the greatest American
friend we have ever known,

and the greatest champion of freedom

who was ever brought help and comfort

from the New World to the old.

[Stalin] President Roosevelt has died,

but his cause must live on.

I have lost a dear and
cherished friendship,

which was forged in the fire of war.

Oh Harry,

I understand how deep your
feelings of grief must be.

[Narrator] Radio Moscow reported today,

that the encirclement of Berlin has

been in completed near Kotzen,

and the reporter said a steel band

is being drawn ever tighter On Germany's--

[Announcer] The final
assault on Berlin had begun,

two million Soviet soldiers under generals

Konev and Zhukov behind
6000 tanks and six--

[Narrator] Here is a bulletin,

German sources inside the beleaguered

city of Berlin report that Adolf Hitler

has committed suicide in his bunker,

repeat according to German sources

Adolf Hitler has committed
suicide in his bunker.

Yesterday morning,

at 2:41 AM,

at headquarters,

General Jodl representative
of the German High Command,

and grand Admiral Doenitz,

the designated head of the German state,

signed the act of unconditional surrender

of all German land, sea and air forces

in Europe to the Allied
expeditionary forces,

and simultaneously to
the Soviet high command.

(crowd cheers and applauds)

The day of the great victory has begun.

(crowd cheers and applauds)

the great sacrifices that we have made

in the name of freedom and
the defense of our motherland,

incalculable suffering and privations

experienced by our people
during the course of the war,

has been crowned by complete
victory over the enemy.

God bless you all,

this is your victory,

this is a victory to the cause
of freedom in every land,

in our long history we have never

had as great a day as this.

I send you heartfelt
greetings Marshal Stalin,

from the splendid victory you have

one in driving the invader from your

soil and laying the Nazi tyrant low.

I salute you Prime Minister

and congratulate you cordially

on this great victory
over our common enemy.

(church bells ringing)

(triumphant music)

(fireworks exploding)

What is to happen about Russia?

I have always worked for
friendship with Russia,

but I feel deep anxiety because

of their misinterpretations
of the allied decisions,

their attitude towards Poland,

their overwhelming
influence in the Balkans,

the combination of Russian power

and the territories under their control,

above all they have power to maintain

very large armies in the
field for a long time,

what will be the position
in a year or two,

when the British and
American armies have melted?

When Russia may choose to keep 200

divisions on active service?

An iron curtain is being drawn down,

and we don't know what's going on behind.

(melancholy music)

Surely if the soldiers
of the United States,

Britain and the Soviet Union,

can fight together and win
a glorious military victory,

and indeed in spite of every difficulty,

the allied statesman will create

the basis for a just and lasting peace.

(dramatic military music)

(MultiCom Jingle)
