Dad! A white hair.

Look for more Alvaro,
five liras for each white hair.

That is, Dad.

Alvaro!

Alvaro, come here!

Dad has all white hair.

<i>Your ticket please sir.</i>

Sir, your ticket, please.

Here you go. Bon voyage to all.

Thanks.
Good Day

Tickets, please.

Hey, must be yours, let fall.

Me?

Thank you.

Fortunately, I only have this copy.

It's beautiful,
Do you work in the theater?

No, it's a family portrait.

Look, look, the middle one
is me with my wife.

Below are my babies.

Guglielmo.

Like that of Rossini.

Alvaro. "La forza del destino" by Verdi.

Norma, Bellini's like.

Tosca, by Puccini. There's even a tape.

And Cannie clown.

I got named after characters in opera.

Because I am a fanatic of lyrics.

That's why...

four years ago I was surprised...

...dressing well for the carnival.

Do not want to see it?

Look at it.

Well, I'd say they are no longer children.

You're right, but..

What do you want?

The children, of children,
they want... large.

Then when they grow up...
children were always seen.

I bet you also want to see.

Like it? Show it to the lady.

Bonita
Already? Pásesela her boyfriend.

Not my boyfriend.
Never mind, give it.

Large family
If you increase...

the wives, the sons and
friends, are an army.

A fragment of Italy.

Look, not only are they my children...

but believe me, are very good.

Yes they are. I do not know, have...

I know not what.

All good, with important jobs.

But the exceptional...

is that they have... hobbies in mind.

They grew up with sacrifice.

I confess something.

It is the first time
that I am going to see them.

In general, come to Sicily
once or twice a year, and...

Are uncomfortable?

You really do not want to know...

...how they work, how they live?
Honestly... no thanks.

Whatever.

Do not know what is lost.

Excuse me, could do me a favor...

...to take me.

Thank you.

Thank you. You know, for my wife.

I'm Sicilian, from Trapani.

Do not want to know where to go?

I am also Neapolitan!

So am!

I want one billion!

Billions!

Thieves, murderers, damn!

Damn!

All are thieves, murderers!

Yes!

Murderers damn!

I want one billion!

Thieves, murderers, damn!

Please bring me the money...

...I will make a killing throughout Europe!

With all of you all!

If I have for the night one billion...

...take away all these
television antennas, all!

He is armed, call the police.

Toy gun, and we got used.

Even the police know.

Filthy!

If for the night I don't have the money...

remove the TV antennas!

Hello?

Alvaro, guess, who am I?

An idiot.

Scuro.

Excuse me, where can I...
can not hear me?

In the microphone.
What? This.

Where...?
In the microphone there.

Here.
Here?

Excuse me, where can I find
Mr. Alvaro Scuro?

Are here at the University of Naples.
One moment

What name do I say?

Scuro, Alvaro Scuro.

It's my son, and colleague also.

How is it that does not know?

Look...

is on vacation, or furlough...

or commissioner is ill...

or commissioner of union, or left...

or retired...

or may not have been to work.

What is certain is that he exists.

Thank goodness.

<i>Well? I'm answering machine
of Alvaro Scuro...</i>

<i>Not at home now.</i>

<i>Please leave your message,
name and phone number.</i>

<i>If I return, I'll call. </i>

<i>Please leave message after the beep.
Thanks.</i>

Well? I...

your...

The stupidity of the answering machine.

What do I do? I can not speak in a voice...

...as taken from the refrigerator.

I feel like... the world freezes.

They say that Naples is super crowded.

Sure, neither are dogs.

You want company, Grandpa?

Look at his legs.

And look at mine.

<i>I look out of my mind...</i>

<i>I do not know what I mean...</i>

<i>or what I do.</i>

<i>And even without hope, get up...</i>

<i>and be a man forever.</i>

Well...

Alvaro, I...

I wanted to surprise you.

Where have you been?

Are you planning to sleep outside?

I always liked you women.

No?

Blow your nose, look no more.

Always with his nose dirty.

The same nose as always.
Let's see.

Yes, laugh.
Strong.

Are you tired, Dad?

A little
Sorry.

Where you going now?

Listen... sorry...

the... the twelve...

Is it the same?
How?

I say that if you follow to room twelve.

Where would that be?
Here it is.

Here you go.

You never know.

Ask me why I asked for room twelve.

You do not want me...
Ask, without penalty.

Well, why room twelve?

Very easy. When I married 45 years ago...

and I came to Naples for honeymoon.

We slept in this hotel...

in the room number twelve.

Want to know what I paid?
Actually, I...

Ask.
Well, how much?

Seventy-two lire.
Nothing.

Today would equal about...

...twenty thousand lire.
It is sixty.

Sixty what?
Sixty thousand.

Everything has changed.

But it's the same furniture.

Remember our first night?

You wanted to sleep dressed.

And I, out of respect...

...slept with a hat.

How far have we come?

Well, I speak English perfectly.

Do you think about and talk
neapolitan english? Really?

Look, Belisario.

<i>Good morning, baby!</i>

Big deal.

How was it?
sure did here.

How on earth did it?

Just look at that antenna.

Why was included?

<i>Attention, leave a message
after the beep. Thanks.</i>

Well, well.

See if you record.

Alvaro, It's Dad.
I came to Naples, but...

didn't find you.

Where are you?
Are you okay?

I... I... I...

well, you'd expect, but...

If for some reason you're late...

or you have other commitments...

what?

Reportata, never call.

Alvaro, look...

better go with your brother Cannie.

But do not call before he arrives.

I have to give the surprise, see?

Are you listening?
I have to board the train.

Goodbye.

It's me, Dad.

Please answer me this.

Why 74 years a pensioner...

be hitchhiking on the freeway?

On the train strike.
It was.

But...

was too impulsive.

Just had to ask.

I was going to respond.

Is Siciliano?
Yes.

How did you know?
Because you hear strange.

Hey, What kind of work
does his son in Rome?

To see if it is so good and wise woman.

Look, just tell him one thing, listen.

The day he was born in 1947...

that day, I said,
local elections were held.

And his mother still sore as
he walked to the polls.

He was alone, I was a teller.

You follow? Then, back home...

half hour later, Cannie was born.

Let's see, someone born in
such circumstances, tell me...

what trade matters?

GYN.

Sorry, expression, but...

and who urinated out of place.

Neither more nor less.

Hey, Where are you going?

Identify.

Siciliano?
Yes

Grandpa!

Grandpa!
Erina!

They are the guardian angels
of the judge Brandi.

Have not you seen in television?

Oh yeah? Does he live here?

Yeah, takes one week with fever.

But they are my friends, do no harm.

Thank goodness. I brought very nice gift.

We open at night.
Are you alone?

Mom and dad was working the party.

Thank... all those...

that their participation...

have enriched the work...
our convention...

offering reflections...

comments...

and new proposals...

of great political value.

They will be brief...

although the circumstances require.

Why should we be brief?

The time we live...

is a slave to speed...

anxiety, is it fair?

Perhaps it was,
especially for our party...

a time to acknowledge
the issue of community...

the sense of "potilas".

Excuse me, is a policy.

A fair policy.

Modern.

To take into account social needs...

A fair policy.

Modern.

To take into account social needs...

and disturbing questions...

the years... ninety...

we face.

Cannie!
Dad!

Dad, look who came!

Hi, Dad! When did you get here?

When did you get here?

What are you standing
there like a post? Low.

Downloaded.

But how many columns, seems San Pedro.

Too bad you can't take pictures.

It's huge, how many people it holds?

You know how many Muslims are here?

More than 50 thousand.
Castelvetrano...

has 25 thousand inhabitants.

And did it all yourself?
I wish.

Just take care of heating.

What modest.
No, man.

And where are they seen when they pray?

From there.

Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.

Well, tell me something,
there in the Congress...

...Will you be secretary of the party?
What do I say?

No party secretary...

but the Provincial Federation party.

Well, what's the difference?

At the end of the secretary.

Talk about something else.

Finally meets the house.

Is not it pretty?
Yes, very pretty.

And when will you decide to join us?

We'd be happy.
Come on, Grandpa, come.

A thousand thanks, but it's impossible.

"At our age...

how could mom and I change their lives?

No, you can not, no.

What is he saying?

Stay here all you want.

But others visit
Yes, but do not tell.

Well... I want to surprise them.

Please.

By the way Alvaro know what?

Where is he? I went to his house
and was not there.

He has answering machine
Vacation, did not you know?

Won a free trip.
A trip?

What if I expect?
It was a... wait a minute.

Why they do not off-hook
it to eat? A trip.

What luck for Alvaro, always wins.

"We opened the gift, grandfather?

<i>not worry about that.</i>

<i>Do you not have faith Congress</i>

<i>Look, all support you.</i>

Not that.

Better tell me what happened
with my interview.

I spent a month.

<i>Nothing happened. Do not be published.</i>

<i>- I say no more.
How can we publish?</i>

Did he kill someone?

<i>depends on who mates.</i>

Nothing, grandfather Matteo.

Why not?
Let's see, looking good.

You'll see.

Broke.

What a pity!

They were rare candy.
You know? You do not know.

Your dad ate in droves.

So I was always at the dentist.

I'm so sorry.

If you know them, are slaves of sugar.

Dad bought sicilian cakes, look at them.

Have you seen them?

Hello?
"Tosca, are you?

Who is this?
I'm Cannie.

Hello, Cannie.
How are you?

Look... is beautiful, beautiful.

A work of art.

Although television is... larger.

And more natural, yes.

I'm going, Dad, I can not wait.

If. Cannie, before death I see you.

At the... the...
the Chamber of Deputies.

Okay, bye. if you get lost
then call or call a taxi.

Ah, Cannie wait. Listen.

And if we met like before but here in Rome?

It would be nice.
We will have to ask others.

Agreed. Now go, then we are.

Go away from here I see.

Cannie!

Do not move!

You can go now.

Hello.
Good morning, Deputy.

This is the meeting today.

This for the convention.
Is it long?

38 min. 21 sec., Of which you
can skip 4 minutes and a half...

...if desired.
Thanks, anything else?

Yes, I wanted to ask her opinion of me.

Hey, why kill them?
Not us.

It has happened many times.

Also in the morning there.

They, when they are around the city...

lose their orientation.

They get mad.

They kill.

Leaping from minced... and kill.

These are going to save, you'll see.

<i>The wine is made from grapes.</i>

Someone will hurt you.
Someone will make...

Give me everything.

How old are you?
Less than you. The money.

If.

I'll give everything, but do not hurt me.

Okay, and in his pocket?

How old are you?

What do you care?
No bother.

No, the camera does.
Please.

Okay,
But give me the scroll.

Do not you want to know why?

I already had enough.

What if I'm not a fucking useless scroll.

If it were in the United States
they would decorate to me

Here, I briefly go to jail.

Do I face female robber?

I don't know.

Tosca!

Tosca!

Dad!

What did you do?
What did I do?

In there are crazy.

Goodbye, good luck.

Goodbye!
Bye, bye!

Bye.

Yes, Mr.
"Messenger Republica Press..."

<i>...Unit, Time, People,
Morning, Manifiesto, Newspapers.</i>

Stay with inserts.

Do not write if I never wrote one?

Call us, not much at least once a week.

I never know where you are.
Where to find you

What do you do... I see... you mock me?

Perhaps you have car
and you make much money...

but I'm your father.

A journey, for some Japanese
advertising and two parades.

Will you go to Sicily?
I have no accent.

Lucky
Why?

I will work in Pescara,
went home, but here I am.

Where? The last time
you lived in Padua.

No, I live in Florence.
You'll see.

Hey where did Alvaro travel?

When returning?
It does not take.

Thank God
He went to the Falklands.

He gave the University.
Insurance is the best.

One night I went to the theater.

He gave me a penalty.
Why?

For my part was very small...

but when he came on stage...

began to applaud shouting: "Bravo!"

She tugged at the public.
You see how it is.

Then came the star and no one clapped.

Therefore.
When will theaters feature you...

How do you know?
For the newspaper and Cannie.

An article thus, congratulations.

Thank you.

Nothing else was missing this.

What was it that happened?

Do not know.

Still exists the cherry tree
that I planted at home?

Sure. Is very tall.

This year it gave many cherries.

Sweet as...

like cherries.

So it should be.
You cry easily.

Come, let's see what happened.

How this one is removed?

Looks like a lot.

We will not ever leave.

Well? You hear me, Irene?
Where am I?

Locked on the highway.

Here we are.

Come in, come.
Yes

It smells of confinement
because I have not come in days.

It's beautiful.

A little messy.

So that you don't say
that I have no home.

It's very big.

Well this is my house.

It's...
Rented ehe?

Dad... you seem like seller.

Do not loose your bag.

Come on, give it me.

Well, I worked in exports.

And don't think I did wrong.

I was exporter of children wholesale.

Wholesale?

Only we are five.
How?

What about the 19,882 registered
birth certificates?

Where is it?
Everyone's out of town.

I doubt they know that, at least
on paper, I made them be born.

An army of children.

It invited if them to eat
I don't know where to fit them.

What is church?
Santa Cruz.

It has a world of tiles.

As in Castelvetrano.

It's beautiful, like a movie screen.

You can sleep in that bed
or would you like mine?

Whatever.
I should not pick it...

and decide my arthritis.

You'd better book for when you leave.

Otherwise, you may not
find there is room.

Do not worry.

Ask me what I decided.
What you decided?

Stay up for your presentation, you happy?

Thrilled.

Guglielmo!

Tosca, Alvaro.

Look.

<i>Liar, you're a liar</i>

<i>I'll get out of here.</i>

<i>Leave this house!</i>

<i>Pray hear me. Trust me.</i>

<i>If you do not hurt me I
would have gone with my stuff.</i>

<i>This time I was the payer, Fabio.</i>

<i>Unhappy.</i>

Tosca!

<i>Dad, I didn't wake before you were
leaving. The boy is my friend.</i>

<i>It will happen later for him.</i>

<i>I hope, if he cries, give him bottle.</i>

<i>Your breakfast is on the table.</i>

<i>I have audition in the theater.
A kiss. Tosca.</i>

Nene, little baby.

How pretty.

Sorry.

Before the children cried
as if I was killing them.

This makes no noise.

That's fine, one more.

Okay, turn around more slowly.

No, hands up.

One more, okay.

Okay, so... no, not like that.

Faces do not interest me,
what I want is the rear.

Thus it is, fine.

The chin raises.

The sunken belly.

Instead, changes twice.
Fast.

Come forward.

That's fine, but hides the tummy.

That sums the belly.

Stefano, How are you doing here?

How are you?

Evil, but no matter.

I do not know how to say, Tosca.

Do not misunderstand me.

In the course of the week...

I want my car... and also the house.

It's better for me, and for you.

Handsome babies, they are ready?

In study 2 they look for actress...

for a film in America. "Dollars".

How not to see who you believe.

Go see.
It will be another porno.

It is an American film.
Go see.

It is there, even for you.

Do you want?

Aren't you?
Not interested.

Need anything?

What's wrong?
What ails you, boy?

Why are you crying?

I saw why.

You missed the soap opera.

I will fix it for you,
and the button?

Aparécete image!

Let's see.

Take the bottle.
Hold her.

Milk.

Milk is very rich.

Invent another television.

Good day, sir Scuro.

I'm a friend of Tosca.
I came for the child.

Okay, come, come.

Excuse me, please...

ask who is the orange and yellow.

Who is?
My daughter.

Like.
Thanks.

The one connects in the same plane.

Again that fool waving.

Bravo.

Bravo!

Way to go!

I'm proud of you.
You succeed, you're happy.

Okay. All you need is a good husband.

Really?

See you in Rome right?
Do not worry.

Oh, I forgot.

Do not tell Guglielmo who will visit.

It will surprise.
Agreed.

Need money?

Money.

Gentlemen, your tickets, please.

Oh, is not the ticket.

What?
Sorry.

I did not realize.

That's it.

It was not same, but it works.

Don't know how to thank him.

It was perfect, not even noticed.

She is an artist.
It was worth it.

Yes
How does it work?

No, no, it is a family photo.

Look, this is me, and
these are my children.

Guglielmo, Alvaro, Norma, Tosca, Cannie.

Their names are as opera...

I was always a fan... of lyrics.

Like me.
Do you see it?

Yes, thanks.
Pass it to others.

That color.

Are your family?

No, not exactly.
We traveled together as retirees.

Also I'm retired.

Really?
And also travel by train.

I travel to Italy to see my children.

I'm going to Milan.
I want to see how they are.

Wouldn't you know where are we going?

Sir, I congratulate you.

Thanks
No?

Not to be impertinent.

Please ask me.

Go ahead, ask me.

"Where are you?

HAPPY HOLIDAYS

Do not disclose, but Italy is beautiful.

That's right. We have evidence.

Excuse me ma'am. "They travel often?

Twice a year.

The other time was to Fiuggi baths...

...And the Satrunia in Tuscany.
Good.

<i>Welcome to Rimini.</i>

<i>We thank the Association of
Retired Persons to come here.</i>

<i>Rimini beach hosts...</i>

<i>most global destination
of vacationers.</i>

<i>We have very modern facilities.</i>

<i>A lifeguard every 10 meters
tends to the swimmers.</i>

<i>Of losing a child.
We offer its quick appearance.</i>

Well. In Sicily they find never them.

And looks for who is lost.

<i>Now I leave the magic of a
place that will make them dream.</i>

Thanks!

Perfect. Now a polka
for the more daring.

A polka.

Madam, ask me what I'm thinking.

What do you think?
If you dare to dance.

Do you think I can?
No, please.

What's wrong? Are you tired?

No.

Doesn't it feel good?

You'd better sit down.

Do you feel better?
Yes

You want something?
No.

Many years ago since dancing...

Sure... with an ex-soldier...

Excuse me.

It's ugly and feels bad here
alone and away from home.

You... Do not have children?

Yeah.
I have two.

But do you know?
There comes an age that...

the children go away.

They need to get away.

And they are right because...

I must admit...
We are bored.

Well...

My sons agreed to send me to an asylum.

Very nice, indeed.

A former convent in the middle
of Olives. I'm fine.

But... I never visit.

Telephone.

The other day, Julio
didn't recognize my voice.

I hung up
Why don't you say?

Sometimes there is interference
on the line, they often do.

Look, Matteo...

sometimes...

is much easier to pretend
it's not understood.

Doesn't bring clarification.

It can be fun.

Please, can you expect anything.

Even the rejection of children.

Lady... I ask because I am sad.

I won't because I am also.

Think, don't continue with their journey.

Forget it.

No, I can.

And to be honest...
I do not.

I promised my wife to wait in Sicily.

In addition, look,
we are very close to our children.

We never parted.

Although this was wonderful.
I believe so.

Ma'am, I...

never kissed another woman's hand,
may I have yours.

<i>That icy little hand.</i>

You are very noble,
I won't forget.

Relax, I'm not betraying you.

Hey, excuse me...

I have three children.

Congratulations.

I have five ... and...

Hey. Listen, Mister... you...

Well... I think...

Did you want donations?
Go to hell.

What is he doing?

Always back like the wind instruments.

Again. In line 32

Dad! What are you doing here?

Are not you glad?

What do you think?
Well, I say.

Guglielmo, do not you play?

Papa, the bass drum is
not like the violins.

It's played occasionally.

Yes, but when the time arrives ...

I told you we were coming.

What now?

Completing the test, then to the airport.

I'm going to London.

To work.

Well...
Wait, then.

It had not failed in 10 years.

And he just happens when you come.

What?
What about that look?

Do you feel that I leave?

For the family Scuro,
meeting is a luxury.

But that's not why.

I just do not like your laugh.
Before it was not.

I laugh same as before.

Come, walk.
I know, Guglielmo.

You're not going.

You're seeing the face, I know.

How do you think, Dad?

I give concerts in Europe.

Furthermore, why lie?

That's what I want you to tell me.

While I know.

What do you know?
What do you know?

Nothing.

But I assure you're
not telling me something.

You can see in his face.

It's true. I hid something.

I knew you were coming to Milan.

Yes

Tosca called me.
Oh, really?

I asked him not to tell you.

It had to be a surprise.

But I expected you three days ago.

Me?
What are you hiding?

Not hiding anything.

What could be?

Where'd you go?

Me?
Where?

Where do you think would go?

Where'd you go?
What the...?

I do not know why...

See, that if you laugh.
That really pleases me.

Yes, cámbiamela.
Don't want to change anything.

But child what did you expect?

Look, look...
Gentlemen, I do not want to intrude...

...but invite me to laugh or let me work.

They're going to ruin.
Sorry.

"Excuse me." So easy.

<i>Hello, Antonello, I'm your dad.</i>

<i>I feel clear of
your favorite music.</i>

<i>But I wanted you
to hear my message.</i>

<i>I'll buy the cassette.</i>

<i>I go away and
mother comes with me...</i>

<i>will be a few days.</i>

<i>Listen, you will have a surprise.</i>

<i>- And remember...
The wine is made from grapes.</i>

Matteo!
Antonello.

Let me see.
When did you get?

You're great.

Tell me what is in wine and grapes.

I like, but do not understand.

A farmer turned rich making wine.

He did more in life than produce wine.

And their children,
working with him were rich.

Facing death, he summoned
his sons and said:

<i>My children, before dying
I'll tell my big secret.</i>

<i> Wine can also be grape.</i>

Do not laugh or so I will be pulling.

You're always complaining you're a romantic.

Unbelievable.
I'm just fed up.

Andrea, a chair was vacated.

I want orange juice and sandwich.

These things and views seem plastic.

It's true
And to eat taste like plastic.

Anyway... taste is good.

How can you be always happy?

You do not look like an old man.

Let's clarify something.
I am not old.

As many who are here.

In addition, look,
how do you explain it?

I am so very scared of death.

Now it is called on to ask to me.

Tell me something.
What happens to your father?

I got the impression that
he has something. I'm sure.

How is your mother?

Pretty good.
Well, I tell you one thing...

I, with my things,
my work in the gymnasium...

friends, school...

I can tell you almost do not see...

Sometimes we agree, but...

if we talk, but...

well, never really spoke.

But how is this possible?

Come, I want you to see
something phenomenal.

Not possible.
You like?

Are fireflies.
Did you like?

In Milan?
Not that there were no fireflies?

I must be dreaming.

Just look how many.

I never saw so many
when I was your age.

Grandpa...

When you were my age did you
have someone... you liked?

No one I liked, but rather in love.

She was the daughter of Carbonero,
I remember.

Her name was Rosa.

Who's your litter?

Her name is Linda.
I do not know what to do.

Rejoice. Also I'll tell one thing.

Do not be shy with women.

Do and say whatever comes to mind.

But be careful.

When a woman tells you that
she won't live without you,
and she is about to leave you.

Do not be fooled.
But is it true?

If so, she will tell you

What is the problem?
Pregnancy.

Damn.

What did you do?

Grandpa wouldn't you know?

It often happens
But you're very young.

No, look, see?

Do you see?
I already have gray hair. Three.

There are fifteen lire.
How?

Nothing.

And the girl, how is it?
What have you...?

What happened?

But what...?

Was it a trick?
You tricked me.

Yes, it's silly.

I made it up, look.

I get it, there is a glass.

But Linda is pregnant
and it isn't nonsense.

Well, you're going to sleep.

A pregnant girl.

It's crazy.

<i>The scale</i>

Angela, how many times we
wanted to see "La Traviata"?

But we never did.

Master. "La Traviata".

Prelude of the third act.

Thank you.

Alvaro, I'm your dad.

I see you have not returned.

Have fun, congratulations.

Please call me when you arrive.

I will be in Turin with Norma.

I give you a hug.

I'm your dad.
Bye.

I do not know if you do well, Guglielmo.

You've been following him two days.

You suffer and you solve nothing.
Why hide?

We should be with him.
May also be right.

But it was always like that with me.

It is enough that he just
looks into my eyes.

And he knows everything.

If I had stayed... know everything.

I am ashamed of having hidden.

But I could not do anything else.

Dad!
Norma!

Norma!
Dad!

Not surprisingly, it's all I know.

Hi, Dad.

Milo, a kiss for Grandpa.
No.

Come, come, kiss me.
Milo.

Will not you kiss her grandfather?

Grandfather stinks.

Why are you laughing?

When one travels they bathe little.

And do not want to
inconvenience the landlords.

Well, tell me.

He sizes the shoulders of your husband?

Clearly.

When do they speak?

Sometimes.

We talked more in the
bathroom than in bed.

His hands were so calloused
that he didn't need sponges.

Liar is not true.

That's for me.
You carved mother's shoulders?

No.
Neither my husband.

Hurry.

How disgusting that the foam.

Can I come to your office?

Yes, but in these days
I do not have meetings.

Pity, I wanted to see your command post.

If you get lost, take a taxi.
Well.

Do not walk too much.

Good morning, "Mr. Director."
Lucky.

And fix the phone lines, sometimes get tired.

It's behind schedule.
"Nose fine."

Get angry yesterday, grandpa?

Gentlemen do not offend one another.

You're late.

Good day. Telegrams.

Can I repeat the number?

Run, Grandpa, run.

Milo.
Go, go, Grandpa.

Run, grandfather, run.
I can not.

Wait.

For failure to pay is
going to delay delivery.

Grandpa, run, run.

Run!
Milo, stop.

<i>Sincere condolences Mauro.
You okay?</i>

Go, go, Grandpa.
Wait.

<i>Sincere congratulations,
Vincenzo Grossi.</i>

Grandfather, run.
Milo.

Will you repeat?
Milo!

Hello?
Run, Grandpa.

Help!

<i>It's absurd.
Eight years have passed.</i>

<i>Years, not weeks.</i>

<i>Can't you accept it?</i>

<i>I know it can work again.</i>

<i>Why when we do it,
it is so difficult?</i>

<i>Always the same at Christmas time.</i>

<i>Or in the summer.</i>

<i>is tragic.</i>

<i>Having to pretend
to fear it's discovery.</i>

<i>- I hate the holidays.
Then we finish now.</i>

<i>Stop pretending that your
father's family was happy before.</i>

<i>don't scream, I wake up.</i>

<i>Every time I see
I feel sorry for him.</i>

<i>Luckily he has no suspicion,
and is content.</i>

<i>We can't say so now...</i>

<i>with what just happened.</i>

<i>I love your father.</i>

<i>But I urge you to leave us alone.</i>

Please do not ask what I am doing here.
I do not know.

What is out so late?
Identification.

Sicilian?

Is that bad?

Hey, buddy!

There are no taxis.

It's too late.

Come, come, my friend.

It's cold.

Here is free. It's big.

And convenient, you will.

Go to sleep there, buddy.
See.

Norma...

What about your husband?

I'm in love with him.

We do not get along.

But we have not divorced.

If in marriage you care,
you will suffer.

Then we divorced.
After all that...

still can't find another
who understands me.

I live alone with my son.

All I lied.

But why?

The truth is we did not
want to hurt you.

Now you're old...

and sick with not much life left.

Tosca...

that boy...

is yours, right?

Yes, I was afraid to tell you.

I don't know who the father is.

I didn't know how to react.

There are many things you never said.

But why?

We always believed most talented.

And screaming and screaming.

Do you not remember?
And we stuck together.

But I... I did for his sake.

To grow strong.

Alvaro, where are you?
How much longer till I see you?

I'm thinking something very ugly.

I can see where it ends
with dishonest people.

Even so, there are
many innocent people.

But I can tell you where I am.

You only have a slingshot.

The burn.

What do they want to do?

Pretend nothing happened, Dad.

Pretend that nothing happened.

It's better for everyone.

But what... what you tell your mother?

At least you are happy...

having them for the last
time reunited at the table.

As in other times.
At least that.

Come and eat in Rome.
Yes, yes, yes!

Yes, yes, yes!

We will gather all together!

Health!

Thank you.

We wait for more, gentleman?
What you make?

You see? We're ready.
Twelve hungry mouths.

You aren't going to take?
You do not like?

So, a napkin.
Do not do that, Dad.

Please there are people watching.

So what, Cannie?

How was the Congress?

How many votes did you get?

Well, it went very well.

I won almost 80 percent of vote.

But what a triumph!

Congratulations to the deputy.

Tell me, teacher, your gigs
in Europe are a success, right?

I knew it!
I am proud, very proud.

It was almost impossible
for everyone to come.

Bon appetit.
Bon appetit.

Bon appetit.

Of course it's a bad sign...

to see only men at the appointment.

Although, of course...

Tosca...

perhaps released some important work.

And Norma will have
had some important meeting.

And Alvaro...

Dad, Alvaro...
I do not know what he did.

Nor what prison he's locked in.

I just want to know when to leave.

Dad...

Kenny is dead.

It happened this summer.

In July.

I, the last time I saw him...

was six months ago.

I was tired.

She suffered from loneliness.

We talked a lot.

But I... I never thought...

it would came to that.

He committed suicide.

Even at this moment...

I don't know if we did well.

We had decided not to tell you.

In newspapers little was said.

Only two lines.

And with the wrong name.

Where is it?

It seems like...

he took a boat.

He went to sea.

Luego...

he could not be found.

As if could be anywhere.

The sea is big.

Liars.

Liars, lying.

A misnomer.

Loneliness.

What does it mean to die of loneliness?

Currently, what it means?

Loneliness.

With newspapers, the television
always controls that them.

Two lines, a misnomer. They lie!

If Alvaro dies, young thirty-nine years...

strong...

the most intelligent of all...

and should be advertised
on the first page.

If no body is living.

How many are there...

that disappear a month or more
and come back??

In his case will be.

Have had something to do.

Perhaps...

a disappointment in love.

Alvaro is too sensitive.

Now leave me alone.

Why nobody sings?

Sing!
Here no one sings!

Sing, sing!

Let me see.

Sing!

Let them sing.

What's wrong, Dad?

Do not you feel well?

When you give me my 140 libras?

Remember how you removed
the first gray hairs?

You promised me 5 liras
for each one removed.

I removed twenty-eight.

140 liras.

Sir, your ticket.

Thank you.

Sorry, you dropped this.

Thank you.

It is a beautiful photo.
Is he entrepreneur?

If artistic entrepreneur, yes.

<i>How many times have I told you,
Matteo?</i>

<i>The money in hand.</i>

<i>The money in hand.</i>

<i>Don't you remember?</i>

<i>When the children are born
and we cut it's nails...</i>

<i>we put money in it's hand.</i>

<i>Simply enough, grow
strong and fortunate.</i>

<i>How many times must I tell you?</i>

You're right, Mom.

I forgot.

<i>Matteo, what?</i>

I thought my children were happy.

Not so.

The sacrifices were of no avail.

Not yours, Mom.

Not mine.

Neither the recommendations made,
nor the people I saw...

for examinations, qualifications...

contests, transferences...

the bank loans...

the coffins.

<i>I told you, Matteo.</i>

<i>You put money in their hands.</i>

<i>The first time you cut the nails.</i>

<i>No matter how much.</i>

It's a boy.

It will be called Matteo.

It's out of danger. He was serious.

It was a miracle.

Please do not get tired.

I finally managed to gather everyone.

Although were not
all around the table.

Trust me.

You and your girlfriend...

should stay with the child.

They will have problems with
their families, but then...

everything will be fine.

And when born.

The first time you cut your nails...

put a million in your hands, hear?

So grow strong and successful.

Do not forget.
Agreed.

And something else.

They don't educate it
so that he is somebody.

Teach them to be an ordinary person.

I traveled very little in my life.

Moreover, almost never.

I can't do anything.

Only birth certificates.

As a young man wanted
to be a signalman.

I liked the trains.

I was mad when he went...

to the cinema.

But despite my ignorance...

can tell you something.

Remember:

<i>Wine...</i>

<i>also made with grapes.</i>

And is the best.

Tell that to Alvaro when he returns.

Now that I've returned...

ask me this question please.

How did it go?

Angela, what happened?
Are you afraid to ask?

I will respond likewise.

It was a trip... important.

I wish I could show you pictures.

Walked a lot.

I discovered many things.

Such as our earth is...

beautiful in itself as they say.

It is beautiful because living...

in distant lands...

they seem better.

If.

How? Are our children?

Our children...

they are well.

If they are honorable in the continent.

We can walk with our heads held high.

Sicily and all can be proud.

What? Clearly.

They also send you
greetings and many kisses.

They are all well.
