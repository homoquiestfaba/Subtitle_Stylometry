<i>YOU ASK ME TO EXPLAIN</i>
<i>WHY I'M AFRAID</i>

<i>OF A DRAFT OF COOL AIR...</i>

<i>WHY I SHIVER</i>
<i>MORE THAN OTHERS</i>

<i>WHEN I ENTER A COLD ROOM...</i>

<i>WHY I SEEM SICK AND SCARED</i>
<i>WHEN THE CHILL OF EVENING</i>

<i>CREEPS THROUGH THE HEAT</i>
<i>OF A MILD AUTUMN DAY.</i>

<i>THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY</i>
<i>I RESPOND TO COLD</i>

<i>LIKE SOME DO A BAD SMELL.</i>

<i>AND I'M THE LAST</i>
<i>TO DENY THE IMPRESSION.</i>

<i>WHAT I'LL DO IS TO RELATE</i>
<i>THE MOST HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE</i>

<i>I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED</i>

<i>AND LEAVE IT TO YOU TO JUDGE</i>
<i>WHETHER OR NOT THIS FORMS</i>

<i>A SUITABLE EXPLANATION</i>
<i>OF MY STRANGE BEHAVIOR.</i>

<i>IT IS A MISTAKE TO FANCY</i>
<i>THAT HORROR IS ASSOCIATED</i>

<i>INEXTRICABLY WITH DARKNESS,</i>
<i>SILENCE AND SOLITUDE.</i>

<i>I FOUND IT IN THE GLARE</i>
<i>OF A MID-AFTERNOON,</i>

<i>IN THE DARK CANYONS</i>
<i>THAT LACE THE MALIBU COAST</i>

<i>AND IN THE TEEMING MIDST</i>
<i>OF FADED AND BACKWATER ESTATES.</i>

<i>A BIG HOUSE</i>
<i>BUILT BY BIG DREAMS</i>

<i>THAT HAVE LONG GONE</i>
<i>TO REAL-LIFE SHIT,</i>

<i>A HOLLOW PALACE</i>
<i>NOW FORCED TO RENT ROOMS.</i>

 <i>( gear shift clicks )</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>THIS ONLY-IN-L.A.</i>
<i>BOARDING HOUSE</i>

<i>WAS RUN BY A LONG-AGO</i>
<i>TROPHY-WIFE LANDLADY,</i>

<i>HER AUTISTIC DAUGHTER</i>
<i>AND TWO FELLOW BORDERS</i>

<i>WHOSE STAY HERE WAS</i>
<i>SIMPLY A BRIEF SOJOURN</i>

<i>OF RESPECTABILITY</i>
<i>ON THEIR WAY TO THE STREETS.</i>

( clicks, whirring )

<i>( car door opens )</i>

<i>( gear shift clicks )</i>

<i>THE PLACE WAS</i>
<i>A FOUR-STORY MANSION</i>

<i>OF CHEAP PLASTER</i>
<i>AND CHEAPER ROOF TILE,</i>

<i>DATING APPARENTLY</i>
<i>FROM THE MID-'80s</i>

<i>AND FITTED WITH MULTI-LEVELS</i>
<i>AND SPLIT-LEVELS</i>

<i>WHOSE STAINED AND SULLIED</i>
<i>SPLENDOR ARGUED A DESCENT</i>

<i>FROM HIGH LEVELS</i>
<i>OF PLENTIFUL CASH AND CREDIT</i>

 <i>AND A NEW MARRIAGE.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( gear shift clicks )</i>

<i>THE RESULT 20 YEARS LATER</i>
<i>STUNK OF A MESSY DIVORCE.</i>

 <i>AT LEAST THE AIR WAS CLEAN..</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( crows cawing )</i>

<i>...AND THERE WAS NO ONE</i>
<i>TO SEE HOW FAR I'VE FALLEN.</i>

<i>IN THE SPRING</i>
<i>I HAD SECURED</i>

<i>SOME DREARY AND UNPROFITABLE</i>
<i>REWRITE WORK</i>

<i>FOR SOME GUTTER-SCUM</i>
<i>PRODUCTION COMPANY.</i>

<i>AFTER THAT WENT BAD--</i>
<i>LIKELY BECAUSE I TOLD</i>
<i>THE PRODUCER</i>

<i>WHAT I REALLY THOUGHT</i>
<i>OF HIS WORK...</i>

Woman:
CHARLIE BAXTER.

Charlie: MRS. HAYWARD.
THAT'S RIGHT.

 <i>...AND BEING UNABLE TO PAY</i>
<i>ANY SUBSTANTIAL RENT...</i>
<i>- KEEP GOING AROUND.</i>

OKAY.
<i>...I BEGAN DRIFTING FROM ONE</i>
<i>CHEAP APARTMENT TO ANOTHER</i>

<i>UNTIL I WAS DOWN</i>
<i>TO LOOKING FOR A ROOM.</i>

<i>I HAD HOPED TO FIND SOMEPLACE</i>
<i>WHERE I COULD PUSH THROUGH</i>
<i>MY WRITER'S BLOCK</i>

<i>AND FINISH</i>
<i>MY OWN GREAT SCREENPLAY.</i>
<i>- WAS IT EASY TO FIND?</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>BUT RIGHT THEN, I NEEDED</i>
<i>A PLACE THAT WAS CHEAP...</i>

PLEASE, COME ON IN.

<i>...BUT CLEAN AND QUIET.</i>

Charlie: <i>NICE PLACE.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( door closes )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>IN THE ROOMS, LARGE AND LOFTY</i>

<i>AND DECORATED</i>
<i>WITH SCHIZOPHRENIC TASTE</i>

<i>AND RIDICULOUS KITSCH,</i>

<i>THERE LINGERED</i>
<i>A DEPRESSING MUSTINESS</i>

<i>AND A HINT OF OBSCURE...</i>
<i>SOMETHING.</i>

<i>SOMETHING I COULDN'T</i>
<i>QUITE PLACE AT THAT MOMENT.</i>

Mrs. Hayward:
IT'S SO BIG.

HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH JUST MYSELF
AND MY DAUGHTER.

STILL, YOU'VE DONE WONDERS.

I LIKE THE ANIMALS.
AREN'T THEY PRECIOUS?

THEY WANDERED
ONTO THE PROPERTY ONE DAY.

FIRST THE GOATS,
THEN THE SHEEP.

YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET THEM TO EAT
SOME OF THAT TALL GRASS.

THAT WAS THE HOPE.
I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE

TO BE WEED WHACKING
THE PROPERTY.

HAVE TO, YOU KNOW.
WILD FIRES, RIGHT?

THAT'S RIGHT.
BIG FINE IF YOU DON'T.

WELL, MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU THERE.

YOU WIELD
A MEAN WHACKER, CHARLIE?

I LOVE THE FLOORS.

Charlie's voice:
<i>THE WOOD WAS NOT</i>
<i>EXACTLY SPECIAL,</i>

<i>BUT THE FLOORS WERE CLEAN.</i>

Mrs. Hayward:
<i>IF YOU DON'T REQUIRE</i>
<i>A CERTAIN MEAL,</i>

I'D APPRECIATE THE NOTICE
SO I DON'T OVER-PREPARE.

THE FAMILY ROOM IS
A COMMON ROOM.

WE DO HAVE SATELLITE.

WOW.  SATELLITE.

I DATE THE GUY
AT THE LOCAL RADIO SHACK.

HE GIVES ME
THE PROGRAMS FOR FREE.

GREAT.
ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

IT ALL HELPS.
EXACTLY.

YOU UNDERSTAND.

YOU ARE
IN THE BUSINESS.

UH, WHAT ABOUT LAUNDRY?

IT'S $10 EXTRA PER LOAD,

AND I DON'T DO
ANYTHING EXOTIC.

POCKETS HAVE TO BE CLEAR.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

THERE'S A LAUNDROMAT IN MALIBU
IF THAT'S TOO STEEP.

( smacks lips )
SOUNDS REASONABLE.

I THINK SO.
Charlie's voice:
<i>THE TOUR CONTINUED.</i>

<i>AS IT TURNED OUT,</i>
<i>THE LINEN CHANGE WAS</i>
<i>TOLERABLY REGULAR</i>

<i>AND THE HOT WATER</i>
<i>NOT TOO OFTEN COLD</i>
<i>OR TURNED OFF,</i>

<i>SO THAT I CAME</i>
<i>TO REGARD IT</i>

<i>AS AT LEAST</i>
<i>A BEARABLE PLACE</i>
<i>TO HUNKER DOWN</i>

<i>UNTIL I MIGHT</i>
<i>REALLY LIVE AGAIN.</i>

YOU WILL SHARE
THIS BATHROOM.

DON'T GO UP THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

AND IF YOU NEED
MORE TOWELS,

THEY'RE RIGHT
IN HERE, OKAY?

AND, WELL,
HERE'S YOUR ROOM.

Charlie's voice:
<i>AS FOR MRS. HAYWARD,</i>

<i>SHE DIDN'T ANNOY ME</i>
<i>WITH THE GOSSIP</i>

<i>OR WITH CRITICISMS</i>
<i>OF EXCESSIVE ELECTRIC USE</i>
<i>IN MY THIRD-FLOOR ROOM.</i>

YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

( chatting continues )

<i>DO YOU NEED</i>
<i>SOME HELP OR--</i>
<i>- NO NO NO, I'M OKAY.</i>

 <i>OKAY, GREAT.</i>
<i>- THANK YOU. ( mutters )</i>

ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO--
 <i>NO NO NO.</i>

<i>THANK YOU.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( floor creaking )</i>

<i>( woman coughing )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>AND MY FELLOW LODGERS WERE</i>

<i>AS QUIET AND UNCOMMUNICATIVE</i>
<i>AS ONE MIGHT DESIRE...</i>

BEING MOSTLY DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK
<i>INDUSTRY TYPES</i>

<i>A LITTLE ABOVE THE COARSEST</i>
<i>AND CRUDEST GRADE</i>

<i>OF STUDIO PRODUCER</i>
<i>OR DIRECTOR.</i>

<i>ONLY THE DIN</i>
<i>OF GOATS BAAA-ING</i>

<i>BELOW MY WINDOW PROVED</i>
<i>A SERIOUS ANNOYANCE.</i>

<i>I'D BEEN THERE TWO DAYS</i>

<i>WHEN THE FIRST</i>
<i>ODD INCIDENT OCCURRED.</i>

<i>ONE MORNING</i>
<i>AT ABOUT 7:00,</i>

<i>I HEARD SOMETHING SPILL</i>
<i>ON THE FLOOR...</i>

<i>( clattering )</i>

<i>...KIND OF</i>
<i>A SPLATTERING SOUND,</i>

<i>AND BECAME SUDDENLY AWARE</i>
<i>THAT I'D BEEN SMELLING</i>

<i>THE PUNGENT ODOR</i>
<i>OF SOMETHING FOUL</i>
<i>FOR A WHILE.</i>

<i>( faint whirring )</i>
<i>- ( sniffing )</i>

<i>( thrumming )</i>

<i>THE WALL WAS WET,</i>

<i>LIKE CONDENSATION...</i>

<i>AND COOL--</i>

<i>UNNATURALLY COOL.</i>

<i>A CHILL REACHED DEEP</i>
<i>TO MY BONES.</i>

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

<i>I HADN'T MET EITHER</i>
<i>OF MY FELLOW LODGERS</i>

<i>AS THEY KEPT ODD HOURS</i>

<i>AND ONE NEVER SEEMED</i>
<i>TO LEAVE HIS OR HER ROOM.</i>

<i>IF THEY TOOK MEALS,</i>
<i>IT WAS AT PROBABLY</i>
<i>AT FIRST CALL,</i>

<i>SINCE I WAS FINDING MYSELF</i>
<i>JUST MAKING IT</i>

<i>BEFORE THE KITCHEN CLOSED.</i>

<i>I KNEW THE NEIGHBOR</i>
<i>TO MY LEFT WAS</i>

<i>A MAN NAMED ARNOLD DELTOID.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( whirring, hissing )</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD SAID</i>
<i>DELTOID HAD BEEN</i>
<i>AN ANIMATOR AT DISNEY</i>

<i>DURING THE STUDIO'S GOLDEN AGE</i>
<i>BACK IN THE '50s...</i>

THERE'S SOMETHING LEAKING
IN MY ROOM FROM--

<i>...BEFORE EVERYTHING</i>
<i>BECAME DIGITAL,</i>

<i>BEFORE HE GOT</i>
<i>FORCIBLY RETIRED.</i>

<i>NOW HE WAS HOLED UP HERE,</i>

 <i>DESPERATELY TRYING</i>
<i>TO LEARN SOFTWARE...</i>
<i>- HELLO?</i>

<i>...THAT WOULD ALLOW</i>
<i>HIM TO EARN A LIVING</i>
<i>IN THE 21st CENTURY.</i>

<i>THE OTHER LODGER</i>
<i>WAS A MYSTERY.</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD HAD DEFLECTED</i>
<i>ALL MY QUESTIONS,</i>

<i>WHICH JUST JACKED UP</i>
<i>MY CURIOSITY.</i>

<i>THE LODGER NEVER LEFT</i>
<i>THE ROOM, AS FAR AS I KNEW.</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD DELIVERED</i>
<i>THREE SQUARES TO HIM DAILY.</i>

<i>A COUPLE TIMES I HEARD</i>
<i>WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A COUGH.</i>

<i>SOMETHING LIKE</i>
<i>AN AIR CONDITIONER</i>
<i>GOING FULL BLAST.</i>

<i>BUT MORE...</i>

<i>( mechanical hissing )</i>

<i>( silverware clinks )</i>

OUTSIDE
BY SIDE OF THE HOUSE.
<i>( thrumming continues )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>ANXIOUS TO ALERT MRS. HAYWARD</i>

<i>ABOUT WHAT WAS</i>
<i>GOING ON IN THE ROOM</i>
<i>AT THE END OF THE HALL,</i>

<i>AND, TO BE HONEST,</i>

<i>TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE</i>
<i>ABOUT THIS MYSTERY LODGER...</i>

<i>( birds chirping, cawing )</i>

<i>...PUSHED BY MY CURIOSITY,</i>

<i>I HURRIED OUTSIDE</i>
<i>TO FIND THE LANDLADY.</i>

OH! ( gasps )
JEEZ!

OH, GOOD MORNING,
CHARLIE.

HAD BREAKFAST YET?
IT ENDS IN 10 MINUTES.

YEAH, THANKS, MRS. HAYWARD,
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE ACCIDENT.
NOT TO WORRY, CHARLIE.

WE'RE TAKING
CARE OF IT RIGHT NOW.
SORRY IF IT DISTURBED YOU.

OH!  JEEZ!

( exhales deeply )

HI.

<i>( door opens )</i>

<i>( thrumming continues )</i>

IT'S GETTING WORSE.

Charlie: <i>WHAT?</i>
<i>- THE DOCTOR'S ACCIDENTS.</i>

<i>( footsteps overhead )</i>
<i>- WHAT KIND OF ACCIDENTS?</i>

SPILLS,
BROKEN BOTTLES.

I ONLY HEAR IT.
NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN THE DOCTOR

OR THE INSIDE
OF HIS... ROOM.

MUST PAY
A HEALTHY RENT TO GET

THAT KIND OF SERVICE.
( chuckles )

WHAT'S RENT MONEY
TO A DOCTOR, ANYWAY?

<i>EXACTLY.  WHY WOULD</i>
<i>A DOCTOR RENT A ROOM?</i>

DON'T KNOW
AND FRANKLY, DON'T CARE.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

THE DOCTOR WAS ALREADY HERE
BEFORE I ARRIVED.

MRS. HAYWARD EVER
TALK ABOUT HIM?
<i>NOPE.</i>

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S A HIM OR A HER.

SHE SAID YOU WERE
A SCREENWRITER?

YEAH, I USED
TO SAY THAT...

BUT NOT NOW.

WHAT ARE YOU NOW?

WANNABE.

( laughs )
AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST.

<i>- ( glass shatters )</i>
<i>- ( bangs )</i>

<i>( clatters )</i>

<i>( woman coughing )</i>

Arnold:
<i>YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.</i>

WHAT'S THE STORY
ON THE GIRL?

AUTISTIC,

BUT IT SEEMS
TO COME AND GO.

AUTISM DOESN'T
COME AND GO.

( humphs )

THE EGGS SEEM
A LITTLE RUNNY TODAY.

<i>( squishes )</i>

( breathing deeply )

<i>( mechanical hissing )</i>

<i>( thrumming )</i>

<i>( keys jingling )</i>
<i>- HEY.</i>

LEAVING?
( lock clicks )

CHARLIE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

AND YOU'RE ESTELLA.

CHAR-LEE.  CHAR-LEEE.

( sighs )

<i>THE DOCTOR SPILLED</i>
<i>SOME CHEMICALS.</i>

THE ODOR WILL
BE GONE SHORTLY.

I CAN DIG UP
SOME DEODORIZER FOR YOU.

NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M SO SORRY.

THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN ILL,
YET THE WORK CONTINUES,

<i>SO THERE ARE ACCIDENTS.</i>

( sighs deeply )
HE WORKS IN HIS ROOM?

THE DOCTOR IS
BEDBOUND NOW.

WELL, WOULDN'T THE DOCTOR
BE BETTER OFF--

IN A HOSPITAL?
WELL, YES, BUT THE DOCTOR
WON'T HEAR OF IT.

<i>THE DOCTOR KEEPS SAYING</i>
<i>THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE</i>
<i>GO TO DIE.</i>

THE DOCTOR BELIEVES IN
AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT--

QUITE RADICAL,
SELF-ADMINISTERED
AROUND THE CLOCK.

THE DOCTOR'S ROOM HAS
TO BE HAS TO BE KEPT

BELOW 55Â°
AT ALL TIMES.

 <i>WHAT'S THE TREATMENT?</i>
<i>- ( sighs )</i>

I ONLY KNOW THAT IT
INVOLVES KEEPING

THE TEMPERATURE LOW
AND INJECTIONS.

MANY INJECTIONS.

<i>THE DOCTOR WAS A FAMOUS</i>
<i>NEUROSURGEON AT U.C.L.A.</i>

THE DOCTOR IS
DOING IT ALONE?

THE DOCTOR ALLOWS ESTELLA
TO ASSIST, NO ONE ELSE.

ESTELLA?
BUT SHE'S AUTISTIC.

THAT'S RIGHT.

Charlie's voice:
<i>MRS. HAYWARD DISAPPEARED</i>
<i>AND ALL WAS QUIET AGAIN.</i>

<i>I RETURNED</i>
<i>TO MY ROOM.</i>

<i>( thrumming continues )</i>

<i>THE LIQUID</i>
<i>HAD CEASED TO DRIP.</i>

<i>I HEARD THE LANDLADY'S</i>

<i>HEAVY FOOTSTEPS</i>
<i>ON THE FLOOR ABOVE ME,</i>

<i>ALONG WITH</i>
<i>HER ISSUING COMMANDS</i>

<i>TO HER</i> MOSTLY
<i>AUTISTIC DAUGHTER.</i>

<i>A DAUGHTER I FOUND</i>
<i>TO HAVE A CERTAIN</i>
<i>FASCINATION AND APPEAL.</i>

<i>( fly buzzing )</i>

<i>HMM.  AUTISTIC HOTTIE.</i>

<i>WOULD THAT BE</i>
<i>AN OXYMORON?</i>

<i>SUDDENLY I WAS</i>
<i>AWARE OF A FEELING</i>
<i>I HAD LONG MISSED.</i>

<i>I WAS DRAWN</i>
<i>TO THE PAGE.</i>

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

<i>( heart beating )</i>
<i>- ( exhales )</i>

<i>ESTELLA FASCINATED ME.</i>

<i>SHE WAS LIKE A DREAM THAT</i>
<i>ONE COULDN'T QUITE TOUCH.</i>

<i>DAMN THAT AUTISM.</i>

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

STOP.

STOP.

STOP!
I'M SORRY.  I--

( laughing )

CHAR-LEE.  CHARL-EE.

I-I-- I--
I LIKE THE SOUND.
<i>( goat bleats )</i>

CHAR-LEE.

I LIKE IT TOO...

COMING FROM YOU.

( laughs )

ESTELLA!

<i>I NEED YOU, HONEY!</i>

STAY AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER,
MR. BAXTER.

WE MAY BE DESPERATE,
BUT NOT EVERYTHING

OR OTHERWISE.
( stammers )
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

LIKE HELL YOU DIDN'T.
LOOK--

MAYBE I DON'T DO
THE BACKGROUND CHECKING
I SHOULD

AND I KNOW THE TYPE
THAT NEEDS WHAT I GOT,

BUT YOU ARE
WAY OUT OF LINE.

PLEASE, MRS. HAYWARD--
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE
IN AN HOUR.

YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE.

IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU?
YES.

I'M SORRY,
MRS. HAYWARD.

ESTELLA'S AUTISM
INTERESTED ME.  I--

IT'S THE WAY THAT
SOMETIMES SHE'S AFFECTED
AND SOMETIMES--

THANKS TO DR. SHOCKNER.

YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR.

<i>( heart beating )</i>

<i>( static )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>DR. SHOCKNER I HAD</i>
<i>NEVER HEARD,</i>

<i>EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN SOUNDS LIKE</i>
<i>AN AIR-CONDITIONER MECHANISM</i>

<i>AND WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A PUMP.</i>

<i>( hissing, whirring )</i>

<i>I WONDERED FOR A MOMENT</i>
<i>ABOUT WHAT STRANGE ILLNESS</i>

<i>THIS DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE,</i>
<i>AND WHETHER SHOCKNER'S</i>
<i>STUBBORN REFUSAL</i>

<i>OF OUTSIDE AID WERE</i>
<i>THE RESULT OF A RATHER</i>
<i>INSANE ECCENTRICITY.</i>

<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

<i>THERE IS, I REFLECTED,</i>

<i>AN INFINITE AMOUNT</i>
<i>OF MADNESS IN THE MIND</i>

<i>OF A ONCE POWERFUL</i>
<i>AND WEALTHY PERSON</i>

<i>WHO HAS FALLEN DOWN</i>
<i>IN THE WORLD.</i>

<i>I MIGHT NEVER</i>
<i>HAVE MET DR. SHOCKNER</i>

<i>EXCEPT FOR THE HEART ATTACK</i>
<i>THAT SUDDENLY STRUCK ME</i>

<i>THAT AFTERNOON AS I PREPARED</i>
<i>TO VACATE MY ROOM.</i>

<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

( thuds )

<i>I KNEW I WAS</i>
<i>IN TROUBLE,</i>

<i>AND I KNEW THERE WAS</i>
<i>NO TIME TO WASTE.</i>

( thuds )

<i>MY BRAIN WAS FRYING.</i>

<i>MY CHEST WAS EXPLODING.</i>

<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

<i>I REALIZED</i>
<i>I WAS HAVING A STROKE</i>

<i>AS A COMPANION</i>
<i>TO MY HEART FAILURE.</i>
<i>- ( distorted breathing )</i>

<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

<i>I REMEMBER THINKING</i>
<i>HOW SURREAL IT ALL WAS.</i>

<i>I THINK,</i>
<i>BUT I CAN'T BE POSITIVE,</i>

<i>THAT I HEARD</i>
<i>HUMMING AS I SAW</i>
<i>THE WHITE LIGHT OF HEAVEN.</i>

<i>OR WAS IT THE GLOW</i>
<i>FROM THE FURNACES OF HELL?</i>

<i>IN THAT MOMENT</i>
<i>IT DIDN'T MATTER.</i>

<i>CHARLIE BAXTER HAD FOUND</i>
<i>HIS MOMENT OF GRACE</i>

<i>AND IT WAS SCORED</i>
<i>BY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HUMMING</i>

<i>HE HAD EVER HEARD.</i>

<i>( hissing )</i>

<i>AFTER A MOMENT,</i>
<i>I COULD HEAR</i>

<i>WHAT I THINK WAS</i>
<i>THE SOUND OF A FOOTFALL,</i>

<i>THEN THERE CAME AN OPENING</i>
<i>OF THE DOOR IN FRONT OF ME.</i>

( creaking )

<i>A RUSH OF COOL AIR</i>
<i>GREETED ME,</i>

<i>AND THOUGH THE DAY</i>
<i>WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST</i>
<i>OF THAT SUMMER...</i>

<i>( distorted footsteps )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>...I SHIVERED.</i>

<i>I NOW SAW A TABLE OF BOTTLES</i>
<i>AND MACHINES AND SYRINGES</i>

<i>WHICH MRS. HAYWARD</i>
<i>HAD MENTIONED.</i>

<i>THIS WAS THE LABORATORY</i>
<i>OF THE DOCTOR.</i>

<i>DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>MOST CERTAINLY WAS</i>

<i>A PERSON OF EDUCATION,</i>
<i>TASTE AND WEALTH.</i>

( woman speaks )

<i>THEN A FIGURE</i>
<i>APPEARED OVER ME.</i>

<i>THE FIGURE WAS SHORT</i>
<i>BUT EXQUISITELY PROPORTIONED</i>

<i>AND WORE A SOMEWHAT FORMAL</i>
<i>RODEO DRIVE WARDROBE</i>

<i>OF PERFECT CUT AND FIT.</i>

<i>NEVERTHELESS,</i>

<i>AS I SAW DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>IN THAT BLAST OF COOL AIR,</i>

<i>I FELT A REPUGNANCE</i>

<i>WHICH NOTHING</i>
<i>IN THE DOCTOR'S LOOK</i>
<i>COULD JUSTIFY.</i>

<i>ONLY SHOCKNER'S</i>
<i>FLAT ALABASTER COMPLEXION</i>

<i>AND COLDNESS OF TOUCH</i>
<i>COULD HAVE EXPLAINED</i>
<i>WHAT I WAS FEELING.</i>

<i>AND EVEN THESE THINGS SHOULD</i>
<i>HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AWAY,</i>

<i>BUT MY LOGIC WOULDN'T.</i>

<i>IT COULDN'T.</i>

<i>AND MY FEAR CUT RIGHT</i>
<i>THROUGH THE PAIN OF DYING.</i>

<i>MY REPUGNANCE</i>
<i>WAS SOON FORGOTTEN</i>

<i>AS I WAS SWALLOWED</i>
<i>INTO A PEACEFUL BLACKNESS.</i>

( electricity crackling )

<i>HONESTLY,</i>
<i>DESPITE MY IRRATIONAL FEAR,</i>

<i>I SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>IN ADMIRATION</i>

<i>OF THE SURGEON'S GREAT SKILL.</i>

WHAT ARE YOU NOW?

Mrs. Hayward:
<i>STAY AWAY FROM MY</i>
<i>DAUGHTER, MR. BAXTER.</i>

Charlie:
<i>WHO AM I?</i>

<i>( distorted humming )</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR CLEARLY</i>
<i>UNDERSTOOD MY NEED</i>

<i>AND ADMINISTERED TREATMENT</i>
<i>WITH A MASTER'S TOUCH,</i>

<i>ALL THE WHILE REASSURING ME</i>
<i>IN A FINELY MODULATED</i>

<i>THOUGH ODDLY DEAD</i>
<i>AND TONELESS VOICE</i>

<i>THAT THE DOCTOR WAS</i>
<i>THE SWORN ENEMY OF DEATH.</i>

<i>AND HORRORS ASIDE,</i>

<i>MY LIFE WAS SAVED.</i>

<i>( soft whirring )</i>

<i>WHEN I AWOKE</i>
<i>NINE HOURS LATER,</i>

<i>I FOUND MYSELF</i>
<i>IN MY ROOM...</i>

<i>WITH DR. SHOCKNER.</i>

( weakly )
DOCTOR.

( groans )

( hoarsely )
I LIKED YOUR SCRIPT...

ESPECIALLY ABOUT
THE MAD DOCTOR.

IT'S JUST A SCRIPT.

IT'S TRUE.
( clicks tongue )

I AM CONSIDERED
QUITE MAD BY MOST...

( whispers )
ESPECIALLY OTHER DOCTORS.

WELL...

I'LL VOUCH FOR YOU.

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

HOW DOES IT END,
YOUR SCRIPT?

I DON'T KNOW.

HAVE ANY IDEAS?

ANY IDEAS?

I AM ONE OF THOSE
WITH A COLD, CLINICAL MIND.

NO SENTIMENTALITY.

SOUNDS LIKE AN AGENT.

( chuckling )

DO YOU MIND GETTING
IDEAS FROM OTHERS?

NOT WHEN THEY'VE
SAVED MY LIFE.

ALL RIGHT THEN.

I THINK YOUR VILLAIN
NEEDS MORE HISTORY.

THE DOCTOR'S
NOT A VILLAIN.

REALLY?

IT READS
THAT WAY TO ME.

MISUNDERSTOOD.

<i>ANYWAY, IT'S JUST</i>
<i>A FIRST DRAFT.</i>

THERE'S ROOM
FOR CHANGE THEN?

FOR THE STORY
OF THIS MAD DOCTOR

TO GO IN ANOTHER
DIRECTION?

SURE.

REWRITES.

( chuckles )
FUN.

( exhales )

WHAT DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND, DOCTOR?

AS I WAS SAYING,

THE DOCTOR NEEDS
MORE HISTORY.

SAY THIS DOCTOR,

WHO WAS BRILLIANT
BEYOND WORDS,

WAS SUDDENLY STRICKEN
WITH A RARE FATAL DISEASE.

SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT
IMPENDING DEATH SO--

"SHE"?

MY MAD DOCTOR IS MALE.

DID I SAY "SHE"?

I'M SORRY.

I MEANT "HE."

BUT I LIKE
THE SEX CHANGE.

<i>DO YOU?</i>
<i>- VERY MUCH.</i>

AS I SAID,
SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT DEATH.

SHE WAS
A GREAT SURGEON,

A BRILLIANT SURGEON.

SHE WAS A LIFE-GIVER
WHEN THERE WAS NO HOPE.

SHE HAD THE SKILLS
AND THE TALENTS OF GOD.

SO SHE WAS...

BIG INTO HER EGO AND...

SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT

NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAVE HER OWN LIFE,

HER OWN WORTHY LIFE,
WHEN SHE HAD SAVED

SO MANY LESS VALUABLE,

MY OWN INCLUDED.

IN A SENSE, YES.

I LIKE IT.

SO THIS BRILLIANT DOCTOR
HAD TO SAVE HERSELF.

SHE KNEW SHE COULD DO IT
BEFORE TIME WAS OUT.

SHE SOON HAD SUNK
HER FORTUNE

AND LOST ALL HER FRIENDS

IN A YEAR
OF BIZARRE EXPERIMENTS

DEVOTED TO CHEATING DEATH.

Charlie's voice:
<i>SOMETHING OF THE BENEVOLENT</i>
<i>FANATIC</i>

<i>SEEMED TO RESIDE</i>
<i>WITHIN HER,</i>

<i>AND SHE RAMBLED ON</i>
<i>ALMOST GARRULOUSLY.</i>

<i>EVIDENTLY SHE FOUND</i>
<i>THE SOCIETY OF A WELL-BORN,</i>

<i>WELL-EDUCATED WOMAN</i>
<i>A RARE NOVELTY</i>

<i>IN THIS SHALLOW WORLD</i>
<i>CALLED MALIBU,</i>

<i>AND WAS MOVED TO MEMORIES</i>
<i>OF BETTER DAYS</i>

<i>AT GRAND UNIVERSITIES</i>
<i>AND WORLD-RENOWNED</i>
<i>MEDICAL CLINICS.</i>

<i>HER VOICE, IF QUEER,</i>

<i>WAS AT LEAST SOOTHING.</i>

<i>SHE SOUGHT TO DISTRACT MY MIND</i>
<i>FROM MY OWN BRUSH WITH DEATH</i>

<i>BY SPEAKING OF HER THEORIES</i>
<i>AND EXPERIMENTS.</i>

<i>AND I REMEMBER</i>
<i>HER TACTFULLY CONSOLING ME</i>

<i>ABOUT MY WEAK HEART</i>

<i>BY INSISTING THAT</i>
<i>WILL AND CONSCIOUSNESS</i>

<i>ARE STRONGER</i>
<i>THAN ORGANIC LIFE ITSELF,</i>

<i>SO THAT IF A BODY IS</i>
<i>ESSENTIALLY HEALTHY</i>

<i>EXCEPT IN THE AREA</i>
<i>OF DISEASE,</i>

<i>AND THAT THE HEALTHY ORGANS</i>
<i>AND BONE AND TISSUE</i>

<i>ARE CAREFULLY PRESERVED,</i>

<i>IT MAY, THROUGH SCIENTIFIC</i>
<i>ENHANCEMENT,</i>

<i>RETAIN A KIND OF ANIMATION</i>

<i>DESPITE THE MOST SERIOUS</i>
<i>IMPAIRMENTS, DEFECTS,</i>

<i>OR EVEN ABSENCES</i>
<i>OF MAJOR ORGANS.</i>

<i>( heart beating )</i>

<i>SHE MIGHT,</i>
<i>SHE HALF-JOKED,</i>

<i>SOME DAY</i>
<i>TEACH ME TO LIVE--</i>

<i>OR AT LEAST TO POSSESS</i>
<i>SOME KIND OF CONSCIOUS</i>
<i>EXISTENCE</i>

<i>WITHOUT ANY HEART AT ALL.</i>

WHAT?

NO HEART AT ALL?

YOU MEAN...

WITH AN ARTIFICIAL HEART

OR SOME KIND
OF A MACHINE?

NO.

WITHOUT ANY PUMP.

BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
ISN'T IT?

<i>DEFYING THE LAWS</i>
<i>OF PHYSICS</i>

<i>OR GOD OR SOMETHING.</i>

OR SOMETHING, YES.

THAT WOULD BE IT.

IS THIS TOO MUCH
FOR YOUR SCREENPLAY?

I DON'T KNOW
IF THE AUDIENCE CAN
SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF.

I'M NOT SURE I CAN.

I KNOW THE STUDIOS
WOULDN'T.

( guffaws )
REALLY?

I WASN'T AWARE THAT
"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"
WAS A DOCUMENTARY.

TELL ME ALL OF IT.

I'M SORRY
I INTERRUPTED.

Charlie's voice:
FOR HER PART, SHE WAS AFFLICTED

<i>WITH A COMPLICATION</i>
<i>OF DISEASES</i>

<i>REQUIRING</i>
<i>A VERY EXACT REGIMEN,</i>

<i>WHICH INCLUDED</i>
<i>CONSTANT COLD.</i>

<i>IT WAS THEN I NOTICED</i>
<i>THE TEMPERATURE IN MY ROOM.</i>

<i>IT WAS COLD.</i>

<i>I NOTICED THE AIR CONDITIONER</i>
<i>IN MY ROOM GOING FULL POWER.</i>

<i>FUNNY, I HADN'T</i>
<i>NOTICED IT BEFORE.</i>

<i>SHE SAID ANY MARKED RISE</i>
<i>IN TEMPERATURE MIGHT,</i>

<i>IF PROLONGED,</i>
<i>AFFECT HER FATALLY;</i>

<i>AND THE COLDNESS</i>
<i>OF HER ROOM--</i>

<i>SOME 55Â°</i>
<i>OR 56Â° FAHRENHEIT--</i>

<i>HER AIR CONDITIONER HAD</i>
<i>ADDITIONAL BATTERIES...</i>
<i>- ( Shockner coughing )</i>

<i>...AND AN AIR-CLEANING PUMP.</i>

<i>THAT WAS THE SOUND</i>
<i>I HAD HEARD IN MY OWN ROOM.</i>

( wheezes )

( coughing continues )

( weakly )
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I JUST NEED TO REST...

( whispers )
IN MY ROOM.

( inhales sharply, thuds )

( inhales sharply )
AM I ALL RIGHT?

( sighs )

YOU MEAN, SHOULD YOU
GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

( inhales sharply )
YES.

ONLY IF YOU WANT TO DIE.

THEN I'M OKAY?
( swallows )

FOR REAL?

YOU'RE FINE.

JUST REST.

STAY IN BED.

DO NOT LET
THE SUNLIGHT IN.

( exhales )
I'LL COME TO SEE YOU
IN THE AFTERNOON.

OKAY.

YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

I MEAN IT, CHARLIE.

DO NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM.

ALL RIGHT,

BUT MRS. HAYWARD IS
GONNA BE PISSED.

<i>SHE EVICTED ME.</i>

I'VE ADDRESSED IT.

YOU'RE FREE TO STAY
UNTIL YOU'RE FULLY RECOVERED.

HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

I JUST REMINDED HER

OF THE HIGH COST
OF LIABILITY LAWSUITS.

GOOD NIGHT, CHARLIE.

GOOD NIGHT.

THANK YOU.

( whispers )
OH, IT'S MY PLEASURE.

NICE TO HAVE
A COMPANION.

<i>( pump hissing )</i>

<i>( ascending footsteps )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>RELIEVED OF MY HEART FAILURE</i>

<i>IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME,</i>

<i>I FELL ASLEEP,</i>

<i>A DISCIPLE AND DEVOTEE</i>
<i>OF THE GIFTED RECLUSE.</i>

<i>( knocks on door )</i>

COME IN.

HOW DO YOU FEEL?

I'VE BEEN BETTER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

THANKS FOR
LETTING ME STAY.

GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT YOU'LL BE WEAK
FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS.

I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
RUN OVER BY A TRUCK.

SHE SAID TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF REST,

THAT YOU EAT A GOOD MEAL.
SHE MADE THIS HERSELF.

YEAH, REST.

REST-- REST AND,
UH, FOOD.  YEAH.

( stammers )

THE... DOCTOR--
DOCTOR KNOWS.

YEAH, THE DOCTOR KNOWS.
DOCTOR KNOWS.  DOCTOR KNOWS.

THAT-- THAT'S RIGHT.
YES, THE DOCTOR KNOWS.

THANKS.

WELL, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT, LET US KNOW.

COME ON, ESTELLA.
OH YEAH, MAMA, YEAH.

I CAN-- I CAN--
I CAN, UH--

I CAN FEED HIM, YEAH.

'CAUSE-'CAUSE--
YEAH, HE-- HE MUST EAT.

YEAH, AND I CAN-- I CAN--
I CAN FEED HIM, YEAH.

ALL RIGHT.  SLOWLY.

MR. BAXTER'S SYSTEM
MAY NOT BE QUITE RIGHT YET.

OH YEAH, MAMA,
I-- I KNOW, I KNOW.

I-- I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I KNOW.

( whispers )
I KNOW.  I-- YEAH.
I'LL BE BACK IN A BIT...

( mutters )
...TO SEE ON YOU.

<i>( whirring, clicking )</i>

WHAT'S ON THE MENU?

IT SMELLS.
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

UH, YEAH.

UH, THE, UH...

DOCTOR'S, UH, YEAH,
RECIPE.  YEAH.

<i>YOU MEAN THE DOCTOR'S</i>
<i>A GOURMET COOK TOO?</i>

YEAH.
<i>( grunts )</i>

LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

MMM.
( chuckling )

HOSPITAL FOOD.

( gags )
<i>OH OH OH NO. </i> OH NO.

( coughing )

OH NO.
YEAH, YOU MUST--

YOU MUST DRINK IT ALL.

YEAH, UH UH,
DRINK IT ALL.
MMM.

<i>YEAH.</i>
<i>- I CAN'T.</i>

NO.

PLEASE?

LET'S TRY SOME
OF THE PASTE FIRST

THEN I'LL
CHASE IT WITH A SIP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

( mutters )

OKAY, HERE YOU GO.
YEAH.

I'LL TAKE THE SPOON.

( gags )

( spits, coughing )

ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.  OKAY.

I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S NASTY.

( moans )
( muttering )

AAAAAAAH.

( moans )
I CAN'T.

( sighs ) I CAN'T.

Y-Y-Y-YOU MUST.

YOU MUST, OR-- OR YOU'LL--
YOU'LL GET SICKER--

SICKER,
CHAR-LEE, CHAR-LEE.

YEAH, SICKER.
SICKER, CHAR-LEE.

<i>OKAY.  OKAY.</i>

<i>YOU ANSWER ONE</i>
<i>OF MY QUESTIONS,</i>

I'LL TAKE A BITE
AND THEN A SIP.

OKAY?

I ASK A QUESTION.

OKAY?

AND THEN YOU ANSWER

AND THEN I TAKE A BITE.

<i>OKAY?</i>
<i>- IT'S A GAME SHOW!</i>

ALL RIGHT,
A GAME SHOW!

YEAH, OKAY.
A GAME SHOW, YEAH.
<i>THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>ESTELLA, AS BEST SHE COULD</i>

<i>AND COLORED BY HER DEEPLY</i>
<i>INNER STATE OF REALITY,</i>

<i>ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS.</i>

<i>WHAT I PIECED TOGETHER</i>
<i>WAS SHOCKNER CAME TO LIVE</i>

<i>IN THE HOUSE</i>
<i>TWO YEARS EARLIER.</i>

<i>THOUGH LOW ON FUNDS,</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR PAID</i>
<i>FOR "SPECIAL SERVICES"</i>

<i>WHICH INVOLVED INSTALLING</i>
<i>THE CUSTOM AIR CONDITIONING</i>

<i>AND THE RUNNING OF ERRANDS</i>
<i>TO PURCHASE HER NEEDS.</i>

<i>SHE WAS A QUIET</i>
<i>IF ODD TENANT,</i>

<i>BUT SHE PAID WELL</i>
<i>AND ON TIME.</i>

<i>EVERYTHING WAS GOOD</i>

<i>UNTIL ONE DAY LAST AUGUST.</i>

<i>THE HORROR</i>
<i>OF HORRORS CAME</i>

<i>WITH SURPRISING</i>
<i>SUDDENNESS.</i>

<i>ON THAT HOT SUMMER DAY,</i>

<i>THE AIR CONDITIONER</i>
<i>BROKE DOWN,</i>

<i>SO THAT WITHIN MINUTES</i>
<i>THE DOCTOR'S ROOM</i>

<i>HAD WARMED TO ABOVE 55Â°.</i>

( no dialogue )

<i>ESTELLA AND HER MOTHER</i>
<i>WERE OUTSIDE.</i>

<i>DR. SHOCKNER STAGGERED</i>
<i>DOWN THE STAIRS.</i>

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD WORKED</i>
<i>DESPERATELY TO HELP HER UP,</i>

<i>BUT SHE INSTEAD</i>
<i>PLEADED FOR ICE.</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD DID</i>
<i>AS SHE WAS TOLD,</i>

<i>RUNNING INTO THE KITCHEN</i>
<i>TO GET ALL THE ICE</i>
<i>IN THE FREEZER.</i>

<i>IT WAS THEN</i>
<i>THAT ESTELLA FOUND</i>

<i>SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR.</i>

<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

<i>THE GOOD DOCTOR'S</i>
<i>INDEX FINGER.</i>

<i>IT HAD ROTTED AND FALLEN OFF</i>
<i>IN THE STRUGGLE.</i>

<i>AS ESTELLA</i>
<i>CONTINUED HER TALE,</i>

<i>IT'S CREEPY HORROR</i>
<i>WAS BEYOND BELIEF.</i>

<i>ESTELLA TOOK</i>
<i>THE FINGER OUT TO THE GARDEN</i>
<i>AND BURIED IT THERE.</i>

<i>SHE SAID SHE DID IT</i>
<i>BECAUSE A NEW ONE WOULD GROW</i>

<i>AND SHE WOULD SURPRISE</i>
<i>THE DOCTOR WITH HER CROP.</i>

<i>( fly buzzes )</i>

( whirring )

DRINK.

ONE MORE QUESTION.

THOSE CUTS ON YOUR NECK,

<i>THERE.</i>
<i>- UH, THE...</i>

THE DOCTOR.
YEAH, THE DOCTOR.  THE DOCTOR.

WHY DID SHE DO IT?

YEAH, UH, MAMA MADE HER.

YEAH, MAMA MADE HER.  YEAH.

MADE HER?  HOW?

UH, MAMA SAID--

UH, MAMA SAID IF-IF--

IF SHE DIDN'T FIX ME--

YEAH, IF SHE DIDN'T FIX ME,

THAT-- UH, THAT-THAT--

THAT SHE'D TELL ON HER.

THE FIXING,

SHE DID GOOD?

YEAH, UH, UH,

MAMA WANTS
MORE FIXING, YEAH.

MAMA WANTS MORE FIXING.

YEAH, SHE WANTS
MORE FIXING.

BUT-BUT-- BUT THE-- BUT--
<i>BUT WHAT?</i>

UH, BUT THE, UH--

THE DOCTOR--
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S, UH--

IT'S-IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

YEAH, IT'S JUST TOO--
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.  YEAH.

SO THE FIXING STOPPED?

YEAH.  NO NO.

MAMA'S SAID--
MAMA SAID THAT--

THAT-- THAT--

THAT IF-IF--

IF THE FIXING
DIDN'T KEEP ON, THEN--

THEN SHE WOULD...

<i>SHE WOULD DESTROY</i>
<i>HER MACHINE AND-AND--</i>

AND THAT SHE WOULD--
SHE WOULD BURN IN HELL.

YEAH, BURN IN HELL.
BURN IN HELL.

YEAH, LET HER
JUST BURN IN HELL.

( stammers )

AND THAT SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS.  YEAH.

AND THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE--
SHE WAS VERY MAD.

SHE WAS-- SHE VERY MAD.
YEAH, UH-HUH.

YEAH, SHE WAS MAD
WHEN SHE SAID THAT.
SO IS SHE STILL FIXING?

<i>YEAH...</i>

OH YEAH.

( grunts )

MY COMPLIMENTS
TO THE CHEF.

PICK UP THE TRAY,
ESTELLA.

LET'S GO.

I-- I-- I--

I LIKED
THE QUESTION-ANSWER GAME.

ESTELLA!
YEAH, OKAY.

( grunting )
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

YOU-- YOU OKAY?

<i>( chair clatters )</i>

I HEARD YOU WERE SICK.

DID THE DOCTOR
TREAT YOU?

( breathing heavily )

IT'S NOT RIGHT.

IT'S NOT FAIR.

( crying )
I WAS PROMISED.

I PAID MY... DEPOSIT.

DEPOSIT FOR WHAT?
I WAS PATIENT.

IT WAS MY TURN.
TURN FOR WHAT?

THE DOCTOR'S METHOD!
YOU--

LOOK...

I KEPT HER PRESERVED

DOWN IN THE STORAGE ROOM,

IN THE FREEZER.

SHE'S THERE, WAITING.

I'M NOT INVOLVED.

I PAID

EVERY LAST PENNY I HAD

TO MRS. HAYWARD AND THE DOCTOR
TO BRING HER BACK!

BRING WHO BACK?
MY WIFE.

WIFE?
YES, MY WIFE!

SHE LIVED HERE WITH ME...

BEFORE I KILLED HER.

I WAS DRUNK.

WE WEREN'T GETTING ALONG.

( cries )
I KILLED HER.

I STABBED HER
TO DEATH.

BUT I LOVED HER.

I STILL DO.

AND I MISS HER

AND I WANT HER BACK.

( sobbing )

BUT SHE'S DEAD.

SHE'S FROZEN...

IN MRS. HAYWARD'S FREEZER.

Charlie's voice:
<i>DELTOID SPUN A TALE</i>

<i>MORE HORRIBLE</i>
<i>WITH EACH SENTENCE.</i>

<i>HE AND HIS WIFE HAD</i>
<i>MOVED IN SIX MONTHS AGO.</i>

<i>THEIR LIVES HAD TAKEN</i>
<i>A DEEP, DARK DIVE.</i>

<i>THERE WAS BLAMING</i>
<i>AND FIGHTING.</i>

<i>THERE WAS LIQUOR.</i>

<i>THEN IT ALL</i>
<i>BLEW UP ONE NIGHT</i>

<i>AND DELTOID TOOK</i>
<i>HIS DRAWING PEN</i>

<i>AND DROVE IT</i>
<i>INTO HIS WIFE'S THROAT.</i>

<i>HE RAN TO MRS. HAYWARD</i>

<i>AND WANTED HER</i>
<i>TO CALL THE POLICE.</i>

<i>TO HIS SURPRISE,</i>
<i>MRS. HAYWARD OFFERED</i>

<i>AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT</i>
<i>COURSE OF ACTION.</i>

<i>IF DELTOID WOULD</i>
<i>PAY HER DOUBLE HIS RENT</i>

<i>AND KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT,</i>

<i>SHE WOULD SEE</i>
<i>IF THE DOCTOR WOULD BRING</i>
<i>HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE.</i>

<i>SHE EXPLAINED</i>
<i>TO THIS DESPERATE</i>
<i>AND DISTRAUGHT MAN</i>

<i>THAT THE DOCTOR HAD</i>
<i>DONE THIS ONCE BEFORE</i>

<i>AND SHE HAD GREAT SKILL.</i>

<i>MRS. HAYWARD SAID THIS</i>
<i>TO A BROKEN MAN,</i>

<i>A MAN THAT WAS EASY PREY</i>
<i>FOR HER WILD SCHEME.</i>

<i>SO BOLSTERED BY</i>
<i>THIS HOPE OF UNDOING</i>
<i>HIS HEINOUS ATROCITY,</i>

<i>SHE AND DELTOID PUT</i>
<i>HIS WIFE IN THE FREEZER,</i>

<i>BESIDE THE OTHER</i>
<i>FROZEN MEAT.</i>

<i>SHE TOLD DELTOID</i>
<i>HE HAD TO BE PATIENT,</i>

<i>THAT THE DOCTOR WOULD GET</i>
<i>TO HIS WIFE IN TIME.</i>

<i>SHE WOULD BE NEXT.</i>

WHAT DO I DO?

HOPE.

HOPE?

( laughing )

HOPE.

NOW THERE'S A GOOD WORD.

Charlie's voice:
<i>NO ONE EVER SAW</i>
<i>ARNOLD DELTOID ALIVE AGAIN.</i>

<i>WHEN HE CAME TO BE MISSED--</i>
<i>AND THIS WOULD TAKE WEEKS--</i>

<i>ESTELLA WOULD FIND HIM</i>

<i>LYING IN THE FREEZER</i>
<i>WITH HIS DEAD WIFE.</i>

<i>HE SLIT HIS WRISTS</i>

<i>AND WRAPPED HIS BLOODY PAWS</i>
<i>AROUND HIS LOVING WIFE.</i>

<i>THERE WAS AN INCREASING</i>
<i>AND UNEXPLAINED ATMOSPHERE</i>

<i>OF EVIL AND HORROR</i>
<i>THAT SEEMED TO RISE</i>
<i>AROUND THE HAYWARD HOUSE.</i>

<i>THE WHOLE HOUSE,</i>
<i>AS I'VE SAID,</i>

<i>HAD A MUSTY ODOR.</i>

<i>BUT THE SMELL</i>
<i>THIS DAY WAS WORSE.</i>

<i>AND IN SPITE OF ALL</i>
<i>THE DEODORIZER AND INCENSE,</i>

<i>AND THE PUNGENT</i>
<i>CLEANING CHEMICALS,</i>

<i>IT WOULD BE A SMELL</i>
<i>THAT WOULD NEVER BE MASKED.</i>

<i>FIENDISH THINGS WERE</i>
<i>IN THE AIR.</i>

<i>SO STRONG WAS</i>
<i>THE PUNGENT PRESENCE OF EVIL</i>

<i>THAT BELIEVERS</i>
<i>WOULD BE REACHING WILDLY</i>

<i>FOR THE BEADS</i>
<i>OF THEIR ROSARIES.</i>

<i>A LESS ADVENTURESOME SOUL</i>
<i>WOULD HAVE LONG FLED,</i>

<i>SCREAMING AND MAD-EYED.</i>

<i>THERE WAS NO SOUND</i>
<i>WITHIN THE GREAT HOUSE,</i>

<i>EXCEPT A NAMELESS</i>
<i>SORT OF SLOW, THICK DRIPPING.</i>

<i>( door opens )</i>

<i>THE SOUNDS WERE</i>
<i>OF UTTER TURMOIL.</i>

<i>AND ABOVE THE CLATTERING</i>
<i>AND SLAMMING OF ODD VOICES,</i>

<i>I HEARD A WOMAN PRAYING</i>
<i>IN A DESPERATE PLEA.</i>

<i>IT WAS THE DOCTOR.</i>

<i>WE COULD HEAR</i>
<i>A WILD THRASHING</i>

<i>WITHIN THE DOCTOR'S ROOM</i>

<i>AND A HYSTERICAL VOICE</i>
<i>CROAKING,</i>

<i>"THE COLD.  THE COLD."</i>

<i>( Shockner moaning )</i>
<i>- HER AIR CONDITIONING FAILED.</i>

SHE NEEDS HELP!
LISTEN TO HER!

IT'S A PITY.

Charlie's voice:
<i>AS I TRIED TO WALK,</i>

<i>I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE</i>
<i>OF HOW WARM IT WAS</i>
<i>IN THE HALL.</i>

<i>IT MADE ME DIZZY AND WEAK</i>

<i>AND SICK TO MY STOMACH.</i>

<i>I NEEDED THE COLD.</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR'S</i>
<i>RAGE AND FEAR,</i>

<i>SWELLING</i>
<i>TO GROTESQUE PROPORTIONS,</i>

<i>SEEMED LIKELY</i>
<i>TO SHATTER WHAT REMAINED</i>
<i>OF HER FAILING PHYSIQUE.</i>

<i>AND ONCE A SPASM CAUSED HER</i>
<i>TO CLAP HER HANDS</i>

<i>TO HER EYES</i>
<i>TO SHIELD THEM...</i>

<i>OR KEEP THEM</i>
<i>FROM FALLING OUT.</i>

<i>SHE GROPED HER WAY</i>
<i>DOWN THE HALL TOWARD ME</i>

<i>AS IF BLIND</i>
<i>FOR THE FIRST TIME.</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR'S STENCH</i>
<i>WAS OVER-POWERING.</i>

<i>IT WAS SO STRONG</i>
<i>AS TO SUCK THE OXYGEN</i>

<i>OUT OF THE AIR.</i>

<i>I FELT SUFFOCATED</i>
<i>AND SMOTHERED BY IT.</i>

<i>AGAINST ALL</i>
<i>MY SCREAMING INSTINCTS,</i>

<i>I REACHED OUT</i>
<i>TO THIS POOR WOMAN.</i>

( labored breathing )

<i>AS THE MINUTES PASSED</i>

<i>I OBSERVED WITH REGRET</i>
<i>THAT MY NEW FRIEND</i>

<i>WAS INDEED SLOWLY,</i>
<i>BUT UNMISTAKABLY</i>

<i>LOOSING GROUND</i>
<i>PHYSICALLY.</i>

<i>THE LIVID ASPECT</i>
<i>OF HER BEING WAS INTENSIFIED.</i>

<i>HER VOICE BECAME</i>
<i>MORE HOLLOW AND INDISTINCT.</i>

<i>HER GRACEFUL MOTIONS WERE</i>
<i>LESS PERFECTLY COORDINATED.</i>

<i>AND HER MIND AND WILL</i>

<i>DISPLAYED LESS RESILIENCE</i>
<i>AND INITIATIVE.</i>

( hoarsely )
DO I DISGUST YOU?

NO.
<i>SHE WAS AWARE</i>
<i>OF THIS SAD CHANGE</i>

<i>AND LITTLE BY LITTLE</i>
<i>HER EXPRESSION AND CONVERSATION</i>

<i>BOTH TOOK ON A GRUESOME IRONY</i>
<i>WHICH RESTORED IN ME...</i>

NOT EXACTLY.

<i>...SOMETHING</i>
<i>OF THE SUBTLE REPULSION</i>

<i>I HAD ORIGINALLY FELT.</i>

MMM.  IT'S THE SMELL.

NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.

I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

I CAN SEE THAT.

( sizzling )
( labored breathing )

IT'S...

IT'S TIME FOR--

FOR YOU TO TAKE
YOUR MEDS.

YOU HAVE A CHOICE,
CHARLIE.

A CHOICE?

A CHOICE.

ONE I DID NOT HAVE.

TELL ME
ABOUT MY CHOICE...

AND YOURS.

Charlie's voice:
<i>I LISTENED, ADDICTED</i>
<i>TO HER EVERY WORD.</i>

<i>( Shockner speaking )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>SHE TOLD OF SECRET RESEARCHES</i>

<i>AND ALMOST GHASTLY RESULTS.</i>

<i>IT SEEMS THAT SHE DID NOT</i>
<i>SCORN THE INCANTATIONS</i>

<i>OF THE WITCHES</i>
<i>AND THE BLACK ARTS</i>

<i>WITH REGARD</i>
<i>TO LIFE AND DEATH,</i>

<i>SINCE SHE BELIEVED</i>
<i>THESE CRYPTIC ARTS</i>

<i>CONTAINED RARE</i>
<i>PSYCHOLOGICAL STIMULI</i>

<i>WHICH MIGHT CONCEIVABLY</i>
<i>HAVE HEALING EFFECTS</i>

<i>ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</i>
<i>IN WHICH ORGANIC LIFE HAD DIED.</i>

<i>I WAS MOVED BY HER ACCOUNT</i>
<i>OF THE AGED DR. TORRES</i>
<i>OF VALENCIA, SPAIN,</i>

<i>WHO HAD SHARED</i>
<i>HIS EARLIER EXPERIMENTS</i>

<i>AND NURSED DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>THROUGH A GREAT ILLNESS</i>

<i>18 YEARS BEFORE,</i>

<i>AND WHERE HER</i>
<i>PRESENT DISORDERS BEGAN.</i>

...BEYOND MY TIME...

<i>NO SOONER HAD</i>
<i>DR. TORRES SAVE HIS COLLEAGUE</i>

<i>THAT HE HIMSELF DIED</i>
<i>A GRIM DEATH IN A FIRE.</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR MADE IT</i>
<i>WHISPERINGLY CLEAR--</i>

<i>THOUGH NOT IN DETAIL--</i>

<i>THAT THE METHODS</i>
<i>TORRES USED TO HEAL</i>

<i>HAD EXTRAORDINARY</i>
<i>INVOLVING TECHNIQUES</i>

<i>AND PROCESSES NOT WELCOMED</i>

<i>BY THE CONSERVATIVE WORLD</i>
<i>OF MODERN MEDICINE.</i>

( coughing )

MRS. HAYWARD!  HELP!
<i>...FOR HER TO CALL</i>
<i>THE PARAMEDICS.</i>

 <i>AS I LISTENED AT THE DOOR...</i>
<i>- WE NEED HELP!</i>

<i>...I COULD HEAR</i>
<i>THE LANDLADY HUMMING</i>
<i>LIKE A CRAZY LOON.</i>

( coughing continues )
WE NEED HELP!

<i>A KIND OF GROWING HORROR</i>
<i>SEEMED TO POSSESS HER.</i>

CHARLIE!

<i>SHE TALKED</i>
<i>ABOUT DEATH INCESSANTLY,</i>

<i>BUT LAUGHED HOLLOWLY</i>

<i>AT SUCH THINGS AS BURIAL</i>
<i>OR FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.</i>

YOU NEED HELP.
( labored breathing )

YOU NEED HELP.
LET ME CALL THE PARAMEDICS.

<i>THERE WAS SOME BITTER IRONY</i>
<i>IN THOSE MATTERS.</i>

<i>ALL IN ALL,</i>
<i>SHE BECAME A DISCONCERTING</i>

<i>AND EVEN GRUESOME</i>
<i>COMPANION.</i>
<i>- PLEASE.</i>

<i>YET MY GRATITUDE</i>
<i>FOR HER SAVING MY LIFE</i>

<i>MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE</i>
<i>TO ABANDON HER.</i>

OKAY.

BUT FIRST, I NEED
TO WRITE SOMETHING.

OKAY, TAKE--
TAKE YOUR TABLET NOW.

( labored breathing )

( coughing )

( labored breathing )

<i>SHE HAD WRAPPED</i>
<i>THE SCARF IN A WAY</i>

<i>THAT HER EYES WERE HIDDEN</i>
<i>FROM MY VIEW.</i>

<i>I NEVER SAW</i>
<i>HER EYES AGAIN.</i>

<i>THE FIRST THING I NOTICED</i>

<i>WAS THE COLDNESS</i>
<i>OF THE ROOM WAS GONE.</i>

<i>THE SECOND THING I NOTICED</i>
<i>WAS IT WAS QUIET.</i>

<i>THE AIR HAD</i>
<i>BEEN TURNED OFF.</i>

<i>WHAT WAS, OR HAD BEEN,</i>

<i>ON THE BED I CAN'T</i>
<i>AND DARE NOT SAY HERE.</i>

<i>IT WAS HIDEOUS AND IT</i>
<i>WOULD HAUNT ME FOREVER.</i>

<i>A CLAW-LIKE FINGER</i>
<i>POINTED ME TO THE TABLET.</i>

<i>SOMETHING WAS</i>
<i>SCRAWLED IN PEN,</i>

<i>IN AN AWFUL,</i>
<i>FRANTIC HANDWRITING</i>
<i>ON A PIECE OF PAPER</i>

<i>HIDEOUSLY SMEARED</i>
<i>WITH OOZING ROT</i>

<i>AS THOUGH BY THE VERY CLAW</i>
<i>THAT TRACED</i>

<i>THE HURRIED LAST WORDS.</i>

<i>IT WAS THE UTTER END</i>
<i>OF DR. SHOCKNER.</i>

Shockner's voice:
<i>"THE END IS HERE.</i>

<i>NO MORE THE SMELL</i>
<i>OF AMMONIA</i>

<i>AND THE DESPERATE NEED</i>
<i>OF UNUSUALLY COOL AIR.</i>

<i>IT'S GROWING WARMER</i>
<i>EVERY MINUTE</i>

<i>AND THE TISSUES CAN'T LAST.</i>

<i>THERE WAS AND IS</i>

<i>A GRADUAL, INEVITABLE</i>
<i>DETERIORATION.</i>

<i>DR. TORRES KNEW THIS.</i>

<i>HE COULDN'T STAND</i>
<i>WHAT HE HAD CREATED IN ME.</i>

<i>FOR YOU SEE,</i>

<i>I DIED THAT TIME,</i>
<i>127 YEARS AGO."</i>

( engine revs )
( gate rattles )

( rattles )

<i>( gate rattles )</i>

Shockner's voice:
"NOW IT PASSES TO YOU, CHARLIE.

<i>THE SECRETS.</i>

<i>HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO</i>

<i>TO REMAIN</i>
<i>AMONG THE LIVING?"</i>

<i>( bangs )</i>

Charlie's voice:
<i>YOU ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN</i>

<i>WHY I'M AFRAID</i>
<i>OF A DRAFT OF COOL AIR,</i>

<i>WHY I SHIVER MORE THAN OTHERS</i>
<i>WHEN I ENTER A COLD ROOM,</i>

<i>WHY I SEEM SICK AND SCARED</i>
<i>WHEN THE CHILL OF EVENING</i>

<i>CREEPS THROUGH THE HEAT</i>
<i>OF A MILD AUTUMN DAY.</i>

<i>THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY</i>
<i>I RESPOND TO COLD</i>

<i>LIKE SOME DO</i>
<i>TO A BAD SMELL,</i>

<i>AND I'M THE LAST</i>
<i>TO DENY THE IMPRESSION.</i>

<i>MORE AND MORE I FEEL DRAWN</i>
<i>TO THE COOLNESS.</i>

<i>MORE AND MORE I FEAR</i>
<i>I WILL NEED THE COOL AIR.</i>

<i>A HAUNTING REMINDER</i>
<i>OF MY VULNERABILITY.</i>

<i>WHAT I WILL DO IS TO RELATE</i>
<i>THE MOST HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES</i>

<i>I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED</i>

<i>AND LEAVE IT TO YOU</i>
<i>TO JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT</i>

<i>THIS FORMS A SUITABLE</i>
<i>EXPLANATION OF MY WEIRDNESS</i>

<i>AND MY RECENT MOVIE SUCCESS.</i>

<i>IT WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE</i>
<i>THAT BROKE MY WRITER'S BLOCK.</i>

<i>IT MADE ME UNDERSTAND</i>

<i>I HAD TO DIE</i>
<i>TO LIVE AGAIN.</i>
