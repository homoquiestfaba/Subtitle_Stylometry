      This is the police!
           Open up!

     Police! Anyone here?

           [barking]

          Hey, fella.
         Anybody home?

  Ma'am, turn around slowly.

           Unit 507,
  we got a possible homicide.

      Requesting backup.

  <i> Copy that, 507. Backup is</i>
  <i> en route. ETA 10 minutes.</i>

            Adrian?

              Adrian!

            Adrian.

            [thump]

            Cobbs.

           - [grunt]
           - Cobbs!

            Cobbs!

       This is Unit 507.
   I've got an officer down.

     Repeat, officer down.

          <i> Copy, 507.</i>
    <i> EMS is being notified.</i>

   <i> Backup to your location</i>
       <i> in five minutes.</i>

          [screaming]

 It's gonna be so much better
     than the city, honey.

  You're gonna have sidewalks
to ride your bike on and a yard.

     You're gonna love it.

         I miss Daddy.

        I know, honey.

      But you're gonna be
     so much happier here.

    I promise. You'll see.

        There they are!

             - Hi.
             - Hi.

      You must be Claire.

     Your mommy's told me
       a lot about you,

  so I brought you something
 very special from our office

            Ta-da!

I'm sorry. She's still not 100%
about this whole moving thing.

 That's all right. She will be
  when she sees her new room.

   Come on. Let's go inside.

         Welcome home.

    What do you think, hmm?
I mean, I know it's not perfect,

 but I think with a little bit
   of work, it'll be great.

   Well, you know, there was
a lot of interest in this house,

          mostly from
   real estate speculators,

        but I felt that
      it needed a family.

         You like it?

  Did something happen here?

             What?

   Well, it's an old house.

  It's got a lot of history,
     but nothing too bad.

        - There you go.
         - Oh, thanks.

 Those are for the front door,
the back door, and the garage.

      I'm right in town.

      Call me if you need
       anything at all.

        - What is this?
    - That's for the keys.

           Oh, okay.

        You keep that.

          Thank you.

              Oh.

           "Lilith."

            What's that?

         What's what?

            Claire.

Please, Mommy, can I keep her?

But you have so many other dolls
        already, honey.

     But I want this one.

   I think that one probably
   belongs to somebody else.

       Finders keepers.

      Fine, but you have
   to let me wash it first.

           Come on.

  All right, keep unpacking.

             Okay.

Everything's going pretty well.

       I mean, she's not
     super excited, but...

   What's going on with you?

     <i> Same-old, same-old.</i>
       <i> Grading papers.</i>

<i> Everything okay with the move?</i>

     Yeah. You know what?

 Thanks so much for helping me
      with that article.

     It's hard to imagine
    there's actually people

who believe this stuff is real.

Sometimes it's easier to rely on
  a supernatural explanation

    rather than confronting
          the truth.

 So what are you gonna do now?

     Well, I'm gonna talk
 to some of the local papers,

    but I really just want
       to take some time

      and work on my book
     and focus on Claire.

            <i> Good. </i>

       It's much bigger
    than our old apartment.

           - Claire?
      -<i> Everything okay?</i>

 You know what? I'm gonna go.
     I'll call you later?

         Okay, honey.
 Good luck with the unpacking.

            Thanks.

And I have some friends for you
    in one of these boxes.

     Tomorrow I have to go
to a new school with new kids.

          I'm scared.

     I hope they're nice,
   not mean like some kids.

  What if they don't like me?

    What if they don't need
       any new friends?

           [knocks]

             Hey.

       I know it's hard.

       You're gonna do great.

    You're gonna do great.

          I promise.

Can I sleep with the light on?

Aren't you forgetting something?

             Mom.

           Come on.

             Okay.

  Now I lay me down to sleep,

        I pray the Lord
       my soul to keep.

If I should die before I wake,

        I pray the Lord
       my soul to take.

            [hiss]

         - 3 times 3?
            - Nine.

             - 3 times 4?
                 - 12.

         - 3 times 5?
             - 15.

          3 times 6?

            Claire?

   Are you paying attention?

              18.

          Very good.

         - 3 times 7?
             - 21.

   Hey, did you really move
      into the bad house?

     I heard it's haunted.

           Stop it.

 You moved into the bad house?

           Stop it.

      It's gonna get you.

    â™ª It's gonna get you â™ª

       â™ª It's gonna get you â™ª

    â™ª It's gonna get you â™ª

   - â™ª It's gonna get you â™ª
            - Hey!

           Stop it!

           [tapping]

           [rattle]

            Hello?

            Hello?

               Hello?

          Oh, my God!

     - The door was open.
       - Can I help you?

I'm Janine, your new neighbor.

            Alyson.

     I thought this place
        was gonna-- Oh!

            Whoops!

           They kept
  all the original fixtures.

         It's lovely.

   Oh, where are my manners?

 Sorry they're a bit smushed,

       but my cats were
       walking on them.

          Thank you.

           Oh, look.
   There's one of them now.

              Smokey!

            Smokey!

        He's my oldest.

    You have a little girl.

   Yeah. Claire. She's nine.

My cats simply adore children.

       Oh, that's great.

So if Claire ever wants to come
  and play with the kitties,

      just send her over.

      They would love it.

   And if you need anything,
         just holler.

      - Okay, thank you.
            - Bye!

    It's nice to meet you.

             Wow.

          Mommy said
   it would be better here,

      that I'd be happy.

         She promised.

       I thought things
      would be different,

  that people would be nicer.

       But they're not.

       They pick on me.

         I hate them.

    I wish they were dead.

            [hiss]

           [hissing]

           [screech]

           [hissing]

         [screeching]

   - I won't go back there!
    - Claire, you have to!

          - Stop it.
             - No.

            - Yes.
     - I want to go home.

        - We are home.
             - No!

    You don't scream at me.

              No!

          Let me go!

       â™ª They put you in
        a wooden box â™ª

     Claire, honey, I know
you don't want to go to school,

     but you need to eat.

        â™ª Cover you up
     with dirt and rocks â™ª

       â™ª Don't you laugh
    as the hearse goes by â™ª

       â™ª For you may be
       the next to die â™ª

   Claire, honey, didn't you
  hear me calling your name?

            Claire.

    â™ª The worms crawl out â™ª

     â™ª They crawl all over
      your dirty snout â™ª

    â™ª Your chest caves in â™ª

     Honey, where did you
       learn that song?

    â™ª Your brain turns into
         sauerkraut â™ª

            Sluggo!

            Smokey!

           Din-dins!

           [screams]

        No! No! No! No!

      No! No, no, no, no!

 Separation and divorce can be
  very stressful for a child.

  An entire support system's
 been torn out from under her.

  The future suddenly appears
        very uncertain.

The hardest thing is that you're
having to go through this alone.

  I just-- I don't know what
  I'm supposed to do anymore.

I mean, she won't go to school,
and she'll barely eat anything.

    Her father still lives
         in the city?

             Yeah.

   Returning to the dynamics
      of that environment

   might be a helpful thing
           for her,

    even just for a visit.

     I'd strongly consider
     letting her go back.

Thank you for your time, Doctor.

  The subject exhibits traits
  I've seen in similar cases

          of callous,
     unemotional children.

  Distinctive lack of remorse
         and empathy.

Further study will be required

    before I can determine
 the presence of psychopathy.

         - Thank you.
       - You're welcome.

  You're not even gonna touch
        your ice cream?

      Fine. Then I will.

       I wanna go home.

 Honey, this is our home now.

   Why? 'Cause you and Daddy
       can't get along?

  It's a lot more complicated
      than that, sweetie.

       It's your fault.

           Claire...

     You're always so busy
   with your stupid writing.

    No wonder he hates you.

    I'm gonna go take care
         of the check.

   What have you got there?

        Give her back.

    A pretty girl like you
 should have a nice, new doll,

     not an ugly, old one
          like this.

       - She's not ugly.
     - Well, look at her.

She's practically falling apart.

       I tell you what.

    I bet I have a new one
       in the back room.

  Why don't we throw this one
  away, and I'll go get her?

        Give her back!

            Claire!

        I am so sorry.

    What is wrong-- Claire!

          I'm sorry.

       I think we should
  talk about this, don't you?

       She's a murderer!

 - What are you talking about?
       - Your daughter!

        I don't-- What?

   A child trampled through
     my garden last night.

           Janine...

         I saw the way
      she looked at them.

My babies wouldn't hurt anybody,
     and now they're dead,

     and she killed them!

    Okay, well, I'm sorry,
     but I can assure you

that my daughter had absolutely
 nothing to do with your cats.

          Excuse me.

         Good night, Rose.

       Good night, Hank.

           [clatter]

        Someone there?

            [stab]

         - Hey, Daddy.
  - It's Daddy's little girl.

 Oh, my God, I've missed you.

      Bedtime is at 8:30
   and no sugar after 6:00.

         Yeah, I know.
    I've done this before.

Just keep an eye on her, okay?

   Ready to go, sweetheart?

Okay, you keep warm, all right?

          I love you.

  Well, that's a nice house.
  How much did you put down?

            Don't.

   I bet you could get some
 good money if you flipped it.

       Jonathan, please.

 There's a unit that opened up
   two floors down from me.

        Earl even said
    he'd waive the deposit.

 Look, just take care of her,
             okay?

             Okay.

   Looks like there's a leak
   in one of your fittings.

    There's something else.

        - What's that?
   - You know these people?

              No.

  No, they must be the people
    that used to live here.

        That looks like
      a muÃ±eca quitapena.

            A what?

       MuÃ±eca quitapena.
           The doll.

    You don't see them here
      in the States much.

 They're not usually that big.

     My daughter actually
   found this in the house.

         She's gotten
    pretty attached to it.

       Bad luck to find
    someone else's muÃ±eca.

  "Local family found slain."

Zachary, this nice lady is gonna
 ask you some questions, okay?

              Hi.

    I'll be right outside.

  Do you mind if I sit down?

       I'm Alyson Simon.

     I recently moved into
        your old house.

   And I have a little girl
          who's nine,

just about the same age you were
     when you lived there.

     She found your doll.

  Do you remember your doll?

          She's grown
    really attached to it.

Can you tell me why you did it,
           Zachary?

  Why'd you kill your family?

           Was it--

       Was it the house?

Was it something in the house?

           Zachary.

           Zachary!

       It's time to go.

No, I just need one more minute.

    He's not gonna tell you
           anything.

        â™ª Don't you let
        the hearse by â™ª

       â™ª For you may be
       the next to die â™ª

Where did you hear that song?
           - Ma'am?

 Where did you hear that song?

    Tell me where you heard
          that song!

         [door closes]

The kid killed his whole family
   and two cops in my house!

     We found his picture
  under my daughter's floor!

Mrs. Simon, the state civil code
        is very clear.

      A death in the home
   is only a material defect

      if it occurs within
   three years of the sale.

       Material defect?
 This isn't a cracked shingle.

   It's a multiple homicide!

  What do you want me to do?

        <i> Tell the bank</i>
   <i> that you misrepresented</i>

 the condition of the property
and get me my damn money back.

There's no cooling-off period.
     This is a done deal.

Then list it. You said there was
     a lot of competition.

 Sell it to one of the others.

      <i> Yeah, well, um...</i>

   - There was no one else.
          -<i> Listen...</i>

 I'm gonna be honest with you.
With the history of this house,

selling it is not gonna be easy,
          believe me.

      No. You know what?
    I'm calling my lawyer.

  <i> There's no reason to get--</i>

           Damn it.

 <i> You knew this would happen.</i>

      You were my friend.

    <i> And I always will be.</i>

             Why?

        <i> It's her turn.</i>
        <i> She needs me.</i>

  <i> You understand, don't you?</i>

     <i> Why you have to go?</i>

          I'm scared.

    <i> Don't be. You're going</i>
      <i> to be happy again.</i>

   <i> You're going to be free.</i>

    <i> You can play forever.</i>

           With you?

    <i> Come find us, Zachary.</i>

    <i> Come find us, Zachary.</i>

      <i> We'll be waiting.</i>

           You know,
 sometimes your mother and I,

   we act like mean children
       on a schoolyard.

  We say things to each other
  that we don't really mean,

 and you have to listen to it,
      and it's not fair.

But both of us want you to know
       that we love you

more than you can ever imagine.

    Well, what about Mommy?

       What about Mommy?

       Do you love her?

             I do.

 Well, I just don't understand
  why we can't live together

       and things can be
      like they used to.

             Okay.

       Because sometimes
  people who love each other

   need a little time apart

  to remember why they loved
each other in the first place.

       But I promise you
      I'm working on it.

       No, you're lying.

         No, sweetie.

   Yeah, you don't love her.

         - Yes, I do.
  - You don't love me either.

           Claire...

     And I don't love you.

  Why doesn't anyone listen?

  We don't want a new mommy.
We want our mommy to come back

     so that things can be
      like it used to be.

      You're the only one
      that listens to me.

       I will never stop
       loving you, ever.

          I promise.

       Cross your heart?

        Cross my heart.

         Hope to die?

    Come on, let's go home.

     Your favorite pizza.

         Here you go.

            And...

       some funny movies
      to make you laugh.

       [doorbell rings]

      Thought I'd come by
       and surprise you.

  No, no, no, I told you that
 tonight is not a good night.

         Is she here?
        Can I meet her?

              Oh.

     She is just adorable.

         Who are you?

       My name is Kathy.
I'm a friend of your father's.

   He never talks about you.

 - Kathy's a friend from work.
            - Yeah.

   So what grade are you in,
            Claire?

          Sweetheart,
 someone asked you a question.

             - So?
So why don't you answer her?

      - I don't want to.
         - Jonathan--

   Claire's in third grade.

   Well, your father told me
     that you like dolls.

      I brought you one.

       Isn't that nice?

       What do you say?

          It's ugly.

      No, it's not ugly.

    Yes, it is. It's ugly.
       I don't want it.

  It's okay. I'm sure she'll
   open up when she's ready.

 But until then, maybe she can
     play with Sally, huh?

Hey! That's crossing the line.
  You pick that up right now.

  - It's just a little thing.
        - Claire, now!

        That didn't go
    as well as I expected.

  She just moved to Monterey,
and she left all of her friends,

    she's in a new school,

      and the separation
     between Alyson and me

    is really hard on her.

     - I didn't mean to--
          - Kathy...

I told you that I needed to be
alone with my daughter tonight.

      I'm sorry. I just--

   I wanted to be with you.

        Tell you what.
     I could use a drink.

     Why don't you let me
    finish up these dishes?

    You go down the corner
 and get us a bottle of wine.

     I really don't think
      that's a good idea.

         Oh, come on.

   You really don't take no
    for an answer, do you?

      Listen, you deserve
      a chance to relax.

             Okay.

    And I'm gonna get some
   chocolate chip ice cream

        because that's
      Claire's favorite.

     - I'll be right back.
            - Sure.

              <i> â™ª</i>

     <i> â™ª One quiet night â™ª</i>

     Claire, is that you?

            [thump]

             Jon?

       Jon, is that you?

         911, help me.

<i> - 911. What's your emergency?</i>
         - Oh, my God.

<i> What's your emergency, ma'am?</i>

            <i> Ma'am?</i>

         <i> Do you need</i>
     <i> medical assistance?</i>

        - They're here.
    -<i> Ma'am, are you there?</i>

            <i> Ma'am?</i>

             - Hi.
            - Hey.

  Do they know what happened?

      Said it looks like
       someone broke in.

     Signs of a struggle.

    I was gone 10 minutes.

    Were you guys serious?

              No.

     She was just a friend
          from work,

      but we've gone out
      a couple of times.

          That's it.

Why don't you come back with us?

       I gotta stay here
   and deal with the police.

          - You sure?
            - Yeah.

   Why don't you and Claire
           go back?

       I don't want you
     anywhere around this.

         Okay. Call us
     if you hear anything.

            Thanks.

        Come on, honey,
   let's go get your stuff.

           [knocks]

           [coughs]

           Oh, God.

        [flies buzzing]

          Oh, my God!

 <i> You've reached Ken Stevens.</i>
   <i> Please leave a message.</i>

           -<i> [beep]</i>
  - Hi, this is Alyson Simon.

   I was just calling to see
if you had put any more thought

   into the house situation.

Could you give me a call back,
            please?

            [ring]

          Ms. Simon?
       It's Ken Stevens.

          Ms. Simon?

           It's Ken.

 I wanted to come by and clear
the air a little bit, Ms. Simon.

       I thought, uh...

 I thought we could talk about
     the house's history.

            Claire?

      Is that you, honey?

            [stab]

         <i> Okay, yeah.</i>
        <i> You know what?</i>

 <i> What do you want me to say?</i>

  <i> You want me to say I made</i>
   <i> a mistake? Fine, I did.</i>

 <i> I made a mistake. You know,</i>
 <i> I didn't call you to argue.</i>

We gotta figure out what we're
 gonna do about our daughter.

 The therapy isn't working and
 I don't know what else to do.

When she came over, she had this
 spooky-looking doll with her.

      Yeah, and she won't
    go anywhere without it.

 <i> She happened to mention that</i>
 <i> Kathy brought her a new one?</i>

       What do you mean?

 <i> She brought her a new doll.</i>

<i> I found it underneath her bed</i>
         <i> torn apart.</i>

    <i> I'm talking violently.</i>

            -<i> Wow.</i>
  - I know it's just a doll,

  but I can't help but think
it might better if it were gone.

      I'll be right back.

             Lily?

             Lily?

         Where's Lily?

Oh, God, honey, you scared me.

        Where is she?!

            Claire!

         Where is she?

        Come on, honey.
    Claire, it is too late.

       Put it-- Claire!

           - Claire!
        - Where's Lily?

          - Stop it!
How could you do that to her?

      She was my friend!
        My only friend!

           Stop it!

  She did not belong to you!
 She belonged to someone else.

             - Ow.
         - What? What?

          Oh, my God.

  Oh, my God. Claire, honey,
      where is this from?

     Who did this to you?

         I don't know!

            Claire!

              No!

        - Good morning.
             - Hi.

        Are they real?

        You come on in,
 I'll tell you all about them.

       See you in a bit.

  ELENA: How many of you have
   ever heard the expression

        "giving someone
        the evil eye?"

   One of the best known and
 perhaps the most frightening

 Latin American superstitions
     is called Mal de Ojo.

           Ophelia?

  The belief is that the evil
  spirit can direct bad luck

or even injury at someone with
nothing more than a simple look.

Children, particularly the ones
    that are not baptized,

    are believed to be more
  susceptible to this curse.

             Next.

Oftentimes in Central America,

  you'll see children wearing
         something red

  or even having a simple red
 thread tied around the wrist

    to ward off Mal de Ojo.

        Lights, please.

Okay, well, finish the readings
on superstition for next time.

          Alyson, hi.

   I'm sorry to hear things
aren't going well with the move.

          - Oh, yeah.
      - Did you bring it?

            I did.

   And it's from Guatemala?

           - Tecal.
   - Hmm. It's a worry doll.

 Some people believe that when
 a child has trouble sleeping,

  it's because a large amount
    of stress has built up,

       but a worry doll
 worries in the child's place

  so the child sleeps better.

         Does it work?

Sometimes, but the question is

     does it work because
 the doll has magical powers,

     or because the child
       believes it does?

        Okay, assuming
      that it does work,

  and this doll can transfer
the child's worries to itself,

         could it work
     the other way around?

I mean, could the doll transfer
    something to the child?

     Look, Alyson, if your
   daughter's having issues,

I'm really not the right person.

 Okay, just look at something.

This happened the other night.

        I picked it up.
I was trying to get rid of it,

and now Claire has a bruise in
the exact same place on her arm.

   - It's not a voodoo doll.
      - I know it's not.

But I took this doll that night
   and put it in a Dumpster,

  and the very next morning,
         it was back.

          This doll.

             Yeah.

       Can you help me?

             Yeah.
 If you don't mind leaving it,

I can take a closer look at it
           for you.

        You can keep it
     as long as you like.

 I want this doll as far away
 from my daughter as possible.

             Okay.

            Thanks.

     I want you to realize

  that as a professional who
works regularly with children,

    I have a responsibility
         to report...

    suspicious behavior...

      to the authorities.

   What-- What do you mean,
   um, suspicious behavior?

    Tell me about her arm.

   Wait a minute. Are you--
  Is that what this is about?

           Are you--

      Are you accusing me
    of abusing my daughter?

    I'm giving you a chance
        to explain it.

        What? Are you--

        Of course not!

        Absolutely not!

  Come sit down for a second.

      It's very important
  that you help me understand

      how this happened.

       Understand what?

 She's a kid. Kids play hard.
    Why don't you ask her?

      I did. She told me
     that you grabbed her.

    - You lost your temper.
     - I don't believe it.

         That's crazy.

     I mean, that's crazy.
 Why would she tell you that?

   Do you lose your temper?

  No, I don't lose my temper!

   You're raising your voice
          right now.

  Yeah, because you're making
    ridiculous accusations!

         You're saying
   I'm abusing my daughter.

        It's difficult
      to be a single mom,

  and I can't imagine how much
    stress you must be under.

   Don't you dare make this
          about that.

We'll give this one more chance,
          all right?

    But if I see as much as
         one bruise...

        or one scrape,

I'll call protective services,
          am I clear?

             Yeah.

       Jon, I feel like
        I'm losing her,

       and I don't know
       what else to do.

          <i> That's it.</i>
<i> I'll see you in a couple hours.</i>

No, I can't ask you to do that.

 <i> You're not doing this alone</i>
       <i> anymore, Alyson.</i>

    <i> I'll see you by 10:00.</i>

       Okay, thank you.

            - Hey.
             - Oh!

        You scared me.

         Where's Lily?

  Why don't I take you to the
 store and buy you a new doll?

   I don't want a new doll.

            [slap]

         I want Lily!

            Claire!

  Why do you always hurt me,
          Mommy? Why?

          Oh, my God.

 Okay, let's see what we got.

           Ophelia?

  Would you like me to start
       with the abdomen?

         Sounds good.

   Want me to check it out?

       No, no, I'll go.
Call maintenance and stay here.

         Hmm. Strange.

            Hello?

    Is there someone there?

  We need to get out of here.

           Ophelia?

           Ophelia?

           [screams]

There's Daddy's little princess.

     I know what you want.

    Daddy's world-famous...

          flapjacks.

          - Morning.
          - Morning.

  Breakfast is almost ready.
    Can you get the juice?

          Yeah, sure.

        <i> Hurt your arm?</i>

             <i> Yes.</i>

         <i> How, Claire?</i>

    <i> How did she hurt you?</i>

    <i> I was in the kitchen,</i>

    <i> and I spilled my milk,</i>

        <i> and she just--</i>

   <i> Claire, I'm going to go</i>
   <i> and get a special report</i>

  <i> so I can write this down.</i>

          [knocking]

I'm in the middle of something.

 I know, but someone left this
      in the front door.

  It's the Simon girl's doll,
           isn't it?

        - Who left it?
         - Don't know.

  I went to put the mail out,
and it was just sitting there.

     Just keep it up front
         for me, okay?

             Sure.

  And there's another thing.

  It's about Zachary Orcutt.

    That's a lot of blood.

  Yeah, looks like our victim
      was killed up here,

then dragged down to the desk.

        Can I help you?

       Yeah, I'm sorry,

    but Professor Carranza
     was a friend of mine,

       and I'm wondering
  if anyone has found a doll.

            A doll?

 Yeah, I came by, I dropped it
    off with her yesterday.

     She was looking into
       something for me.

 I'm gonna need you to leave.

  There's a detective outside
 that'll take your statement.

     Danny, can you please
    escort this woman out?

Okay, but it's really important
   that you find this doll.

 - I need you to come with me.
         - Yeah, but--

    - Get her out of here.
      - Yeah, okay, I'm--

        Right this way.

           - Sorry.
    - [cell phone ringing]

   Anyway, they dragged her
      from here to there.

            Right.
      And down the steps.

            Hello?

 I really need to talk to you
         about Claire.

  How soon can you get here?

 Halfway to the city is gonna
 be like another hour or two.

    I know you went to see
        Zachary Orcutt.

   <i> You know I evaluated him</i>
 <i> for the court five years ago</i>

<i> after he murdered his family.</i>

       Okay. Why are you
       telling me this?

         Shortly after
      you spoke with him,

        Zachary Orcutt
   disappeared from his ward

 <i> and hasn't been seen since.</i>

      Are you telling me
   that Claire is in danger?

        <i> Just get here</i>
     <i> as soon as you can.</i>

      Jane, I need you to
     reschedule my next--

          [clinking]

            [stab]

            [clank]

            Claire.

          Sweetheart?

          Sweetheart!

            Daddy?

        Just checking.

            Claire?

          Sweetheart?

    Claire, open the door!

            Claire!

            Claire!

            Hello?

            Hello!

       JONATHAN: Claire?

          Sweetheart?

            Claire!

     ALYSON: Anybody here?

          Oh, my God!

            Claire?

            Claire!

  Claire, you open this door
          right now.

        Do you hear me?

      Claire, Daddy says
   open this door right now!

          Sweetheart?

There's something else in here.

   Claire, give me the doll,
           sweetie.

              No.

           - Claire.
         - That's it.

              No!
           [screams]

            Daddy!

           Jonathan!
       Stop it, stop it!

      They're connected!

             Look.

      â™ª Don't do you look
    as the hearse goes by â™ª

       - Where'd it go?
 - Where is it? Where is she?

         Where is it?

         [door closes]

       It's downstairs.
     Stay here. Stay here!

    I'd run if I were you.

            Claire?

            Claire!

      [doorknob rattling]

      Claire! Oh, my God.

        No sign of it.

       We're going now!

    Don't just stand there.
          Move. Move!

      [speaking Spanish]

          [rumbling]

        It's a prayer.
 It's not getting out anymore.

           - No! No!
           - Claire!

     You've got to get her
         out of here!

     Let me go! Let me go!

     - Where are we going?
  - Anywhere! Far from here!

       How's she doing?

  Fever still hasn't broken.

       - May I see her?
            - Yeah.

        You were right.

  There's a strong connection
 between Claire and the doll.

Exactly what kind of connection
  are we talking about here?

    There are three stages.

   The first stage, the doll
and the subject are introduced.

     In the second stage,

    the doll actually gets
     into the host's mind.

         It influences
     his or her thoughts,

       starts to change
     the way they behave.

And the third and final stage,
the doll and the host will meld.

      They'll become one.

      - Are we too late?
      - I don't think so.

       But I don't think
   we have much time either.

        Well, how about
  if we get her to a doctor?

   There's gotta be someone
    who could do something.

  It's very important that we
handle this in a specific way.

       So it is possible
      to break the bond.

 I don't know. I thought if we
  got your daughter far away

    that it would free her,
       but I was wrong.

      The doll still has
        a hold on her.

     Then I'll destroy it.

  I'll go back to the house,
     and I'll destroy it.

          Jonathan...

      This time of night,
 I can be there in two hours.

     You can't. You can't!

  - Do you have any children?
             - No.

Then you couldn't possibly know
  what it's like to sit there

and watch your daughter suffer
   and do nothing about it.

    You're right, I can't,
      but what I do know

 is that if you don't dispose
    of this doll properly,

 whatever happens to that doll
 will happen to your daughter.

       If the doll dies,
         Claire dies.

What is it that we need to do?
    What is the proper way?

      You have to remove
        the eyes first.

    If you remove the eyes
        from the doll,

  the connection with Claire
      should be severed.

   What do you mean, should?

  How many times do you think
        I've done this?

Okay, then that's what we'll do.

 And when were done, I'm gonna
   burn the frickin' thing.

              No!

     - Come here, Claire.
    - Jonathan, be careful.

            - What?
   - Don't let her have it!

       You let her live!

           Jonathan!

          Oh, my God.
         Where is she?

         [door closes]

        She's outside.

            Claire!

           - Claire!
        - Where is she?

    - I'll check over here.
  - Okay. We'll go this way.

            Claire!

            Claire?

      Stop! Claire, stop!

          [screaming]

            Elena!

     [screaming continues]

           [screams]

          [screaming]

            Elena!

          Oh, my God.

         Get the tarp!

             Okay.

            Claire.

            Elena.

               Elena?

     We're gonna be okay.

           Hold on!

        Everybody okay?

          [grunting]

      We have to find it.

       - I'll go get it.
You're not getting anything!

           - Claire.
           - Claire!

            Claire.

            Claire.

           Oh, my--

          Sweetheart.

   Just give Daddy the doll.

          [chuckles]

   There is no doll, Daddy.

 Claire, give Daddy the doll.

              No!

         Your daughter
   doesn't need you anymore,

       and neither do I.

            Alyson!

            Claire!

           Claire...

            Alyson!

        Goodbye, Mommy.

              No!

             - No!
          - The eyes!

          [screaming]

          Can I help?

  Go upstairs and bring your
  mother's dresser down here.

You think you can handle that?
        - You're funny.

No, there's some picture frames
      in the living room.

      You can grab those.

             Okay.

She doesn't remember anything?
          - Nothing.

 I mean, she remembers moving
 in here, but that's about it.

             Good.
    Let's keep it that way.

     You sure about this?

          About what?

           About us.

             Yeah.

           I'm sure.

          I love you.

          I love you.

           Come on.

        Let's go home.

             Okay.

       â™ª Don't you laugh
    as the hearse goes by â™ª
