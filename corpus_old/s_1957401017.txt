How's my life gonna be?
I don't know.

I don't know.

Maybe good, maybe bad.
I don't know.

Lord knows.

<i>CitÃ© Soleil</i>

<i>is a new city in Port-au-Prince.</i>

<i>A slum</i>

<i>built up with people</i>
<i>coming from the countryside.</i>

<i>Poor people</i>

<i>coming to Port-au-Prince</i>
<i>with the hope</i>

<i>to find a better living.</i>

<i>At the time of FranÃ§ois Duvalier</i>

<i>he was going to build up</i>
<i>a city</i>

<i>for tourists to see</i>
<i>that there is something</i>

<i>beautiful in Haiti.</i>

<i>We've waited for so long</i>
<i>The government's full of shit</i>

<i>We're waiting for change</i>
<i>We need it, let me tell you</i>

I know who I am.

I know where I wanna be.

I know where I'm from also.

The life of a young man
like me

you have to have
your own dreams.

<i>Listen up</i>
<i>I'm here to tell you a story</i>

<i>I declare that</i>
<i>what I tell you is the truth</i>

<i>2pac could sing</i>
<i>His parents were full of hope</i>

<i>Couldn't imagine</i>
<i>he'd be destroyed like that</i>

<i>See what the police did</i>
<i>Cast them into darkness</i>

<i>His parents are in despair</i>
<i>Oh God, our Father</i>

<i>Look at the people of our youth</i>
<i>Carrying a cross</i>

<i>Day after day</i>
<i>The cross becomes too heavy</i>

Oh, check out the real situation.

That's my fucking girlfriend,
nigga baby.

Let me see how many it is.

35 bullets.

They may call me a gangster,
but I'm also a rapper.

Oh, goddamn.
Let's go, baby! Let's go!

I'm in CitÃ© Soleil.
My soldiers are in CitÃ© Soleil.

They know I'm pure mafia.
You don't fuck with 2pac. No!

I'm 2pac. I'll eat you alive
and no one know will ever know.

But if you attack my kid

I'll go after you in broad
daylight, understand? Broad daylight!

Don't cry, baby.

Dad is not going to die.

Got a beautiful daughter, man.
She is three years old.

I got to take care of her and all.

I don't want to die.
All we need is peace, baby.

Unity Makes Strong.

Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!

Aristide to prison!
Chimeres to school!

I used to burn tires in the street
for Aristide, you know.

Write his name everywhere on the
road, "Vive Aristide", you know.

"Down with the opposition".
That's what I do.

When they see we fight for Aristide.
We give Aristide power.

What do they do? They know
they can't fuck with Aristide.

Now they make us hot!

They give us the name "Chimeres"
and make everybody scared of us.

We are in the learning process
of building a state of law.

How could we let thugs, gangs

moving ahead with weapons
in their hands? No!

<i>We're with the big boss</i>
<i>Nobody can hurt us now</i>

<i>Nobody can hit us</i>
<i>with their bullets today</i>

I got the big boss
in the government.

So they give me this car
to work in, you see?

<i>Official Vehicle</i>
<i>Mayor of Port-au-Prince</i>

It's my pass.

It's like that, man.
We're cool, brother.

They don't wanna rent
the house no more

with all the Chimeres
running around with guns.

That's not true.
That's complete bullshit.

What am I gonna do
if the Chimeres make them leave?

Don't worry.
I'll come back later.

See? The big boss is here.
I take care of things.

It's for their own good.
When my guys fuck up, I fix it.

I want you to understand, dog.

That song, that music is
the real Tupac, nigga.

Peace.

Planet. You understand?
We can never have peace.

<i>That's why I keep my pistol</i>
<i>in the street, nigga</i>

I was just talking to
my little brother, Bily. Goddamn...

They call him <i>Iron Pants, </i>baby.

You know, we're two brothers.

Like y'all know. 2pac, fuck.
I'm a thugster, a gangster.

But Bily, not a gangster.
It's true.

Bily wants to be president,
you know, of Haiti.

Fuck Haiti, man.

But my brother, I respect him anyway.
I respect him.

<i>I used to be like 2pac</i>
<i>It wasn't me</i>

<i>I used to be like Che Guevara</i>
<i>It wasn't me</i>

Yo, Lily, just relax.
No money now.

I'm a poor man now.

You steal something, pow! You die!

Just try and do your best, alright?

If you are a rich man, you are
supposed to help the poor people.

If you see the life
of people here

no house to sleep in, no job,
no water, nothing to eat

no money to pay for school
for the children.

But they have a gun.
What do you think they can do?

People of CitÃ© Soleil have
no one to speak for them.

There is only Aristide.

CitÃ© Soleil might have
about 300,000 people.

Soleil 1, Soleil 3, Soleil 5.

Okay, my town is right here.
Soleil 19, baby.

Labanye, Amaral, 2pac,
Bily, Dread Wilmer.

Fuck, we're five guys, man.

We're five guys!
We represent CitÃ© Soleil.

I'm going to the car.

This is Bily here.

We're on the microphone.
We must have the power.

It's me the power!

My brother,
I really love my little brother.

He works for Aristide.
He's a Lavals, fuck!

I can't fight against my brother.
I have to be with him.

They are all dressed now.

Everything is in the hands of 2pac.

What about the guns?

I gave guns to three people.

You know I'm the chief.

Am not going out without a weapon.

They say Bily makes a lot
of trouble on the streets.

Yeah sure, I make lots of shit
when we hit the streets

but apart from that, shoot at
students from the schools? No.

The assassins, rebels who
are against us? Yes.

Is Labanye there also?

Yes, if he don't go,
Aristide will kill him.

You gotta be a real G.
Motherfucker! Thug for life!

Okay... Hello?

Hello? Hello, Bily.

What?

Fuck.
He had a car accident.

All of his guys have problems.

And he asked for, you know,
bandage and everything.

But, I don't know, I cannot...

Helicopter, Mr. Aristide.

What?

Don't be the President's soldier,
okay? At least for a few days.

Last night we were
at President Aristide's house

providing security for him.

We stayed till morning
and went to barricade the streets.

Bily was driving and falling asleep.

The car was going fast, really fast.

The car rolled around.

It rolled around once,
and the second time it stopped.

Franzo's wounded.
He's got bruises all over.

They had an accident.
I wanted to talk to Franzo.

2pac says I went back
to steal from him.

Me? How come?
Why should I do that?

I'm sure you took it.
Listen to me.

What money? Ask Franzo.
He's right here.

We were on a mission
and came straight home.

-I'm gonna kill you.
-Oh, this is bad.

I don't mess with people's stuff.
Get it?

I brought it to you.
Gave everything back.

I'd never go in his pockets.
I'd never steal from Franzo.

-I'm talking and you're interrupting!
-No, Chief.

Fuck you!

-I'm gonna kill you!
-I know nothing about it!

The Prime Minister has
ordered the police force

to crush our demonstration.

Let's go, baby. Let's go.

Peace and love.

Everybody's scared of CitÃ© Soleil.
Everybody's afraid of CitÃ© Soleil.

I know in CitÃ© Soleil you never
live long, always die young.

Always die young.

-What's her name?
-Genaldo.

You see the head?

-There's a lot of pressure.
-Yes, it's water inside.

The doctor said if the head stays
like this, it will explode.

Listen, I'll call the lady
I told you about.

Hello... I would like to...

Hello?

Aristide let me stay in prison.
Do two years.

And for no reason.
He knew I didn't do nothing.

And Aristide's like a motherfucker,
stupid motherfucker.

He didn't react. He doesn't do nothing
for me, like he doesn't know me.

Fuck Aristide. You don't know me?
Of course I know you. You know me.

When I got out, I go in my town
in CitÃ© Soleil. Fuck...

What I see, baby.

I cannot fight against Aristide
with guns. No, no, no.

I say I'm gonna take
another way, baby.

I'm gonna fight against
him with my music.

<i>All you sleepyheads, wake up</i>

<i>Listen to the guard of the cemetery</i>

<i>The war has just begun</i>
<i>We will not surrender</i>

<i>We're men of strength</i>
<i>We don't make mistakes</i>

<i>The spirits gave my balls power</i>
<i>to ring the bells at noon</i>

<i>He makes me invincible</i>
<i>Like it or not, this is his will</i>

<i>My machete's too sharp</i>
<i>Nobody can't touch me</i>

<i>These words are nuclear weapons</i>
<i>They'll silence you</i>

<i>My bullets will go through you</i>
<i>You won't even know it</i>

<i>We're too strong for you</i>

Oh my God!

Oh Lord, man. That motherfucker
made that music in prison.

Me and him sat down.
We said, hey, look man

what kind of music
we got to write, man?

Me, I used to sing only outlaw music.

That was only thing I sang about.
Being a gangster. Criminal.

Normal shit... killing people.

Couldn't get them with a gun?
We'd get them with machetes.

We don't fuck around.
Fuck you up with a baseball bat.

But this gentleman said no.

Wyclef, what's up? It's 2pac.

-It's Wyclef Jean.
-What's going on, Clef?

-Word up, my man.
-You know why I call myself Pac?

Cause I'm not stupid, man.
Tupac was a smart motherfucker.

When I say I'm talking to 2pac,
I have to say it's not American Tupac.

I tell them the real 2pac is
from CitÃ© Soleil, partner.

I made this song about
our youth, it's my story.

I wrote it in prison.
I can make a great album.

Listen to this. Let me sing it for you.
Please listen.

<i>The Life of Our Youth.</i>

<i>I invite you to sit and listen</i>
<i>to a story gone bad</i>

<i>The story of our youth</i>

<i>It's the story of a boy</i>
<i>who's barely seventeen</i>

<i>He had some talent</i>
<i>Could have been somebody</i>

<i>The police changed his fate</i>
<i>Turned him into nothing</i>

<i>How did his fate turn out</i>
Clef, listen.

<i>2pac's talent was singing</i>

<i>The police hated him</i>
<i>Threw him in jail</i>

<i>He was still in 4th grade</i>
<i>They sentenced him to life</i>

<i>He'd done nothing wrong</i>
<i>Just smoking weed</i>

<i>Look how they brought him down</i>
<i>He became a victim</i>

<i>For a year and a half</i>
<i>Being way too young</i>

<i>He endured a heavy sentence</i>
<i>Went down and down</i>

<i>We need support and guidance</i>
<i>We have to tell them that</i>

<i>A lot of support and guidance</i>
<i>We have to tell them that</i>

Come listen to my music, Amaral.
Come listen to my music.

<i>Becoming a victim</i>

<i>Being way too young</i>
<i>He endured a heavy sentence</i>

<i>I will go down</i>
Fucking go down, nigga!

We already passed St. Marc
on our way to the capital.

When we arrive at the capital,
there will only be one solution!

We will take the National Palace.

We used to be with Lavalas.

Lavalas paid for sticks and machetes
so we could beat the people.

Since Lavalas killed my brother,
we revolted against Aristide.

If those guys get Aristide out, one
of them will be president? Fuck that!

I'm not happy with the opposition.
I'm just telling you they may win.

So you want to fight
until the end for Aristide?

Until you are...
until your death for Aristide.

That's how it is, Lele.
He can't give it up now.

They take me for a gangster, not
a person who wants development.

You think those guys will leave me
alone? Stop calling me Chimere?

They know a lot of Chimeres
don't have a choice.

Okay, why do they know that
and they don't do nothing?

They want to fight with us.

I don't know about Bily.
I'm talking to my little brother.

Lele, I stop, I die.
Anything I do, I die.

Chief Bily!

Everything under control?

-Is everything quiet here?
-We're waiting to see what happens.

-Been working?
-I haven't worked all week.

Well, you should. I think the President
might leave Haiti this week.

I don't know about that.
I don't know.

Okay, bye.

How you guys doing?

Trying to get money for school.

I'll give you some money
for food and for school.

VoilÃ !

I hear people calling me
a gangster and a Chimere.

But nobody wants to help
people advance here.

Nobody wants to help people
get an education.

If you just listen to your kids,
then you'll hear what they need.

Then you'll help them.

<i>I am the bull</i>

<i>Your daddy is not going to die there</i>

<i>I'm already a bull</i>

<i>Your papa bull is not</i>
<i>going to die out there</i>

Bily is just a kid.
Somehow he's my kid.

I don't want to lose
the same way Bily did.

They fucked with Bily's head,
made him a Lavalas.

I bought Bily a gun.
He gave it to the government.

What is that shit?
I paid $800 for that gun!

I said I gave it to you.
He goes: "It belongs to the boss!"

You can't do that shit in CitÃ© Soleil!

He runs his gang
like a police station.

What kind of bullshit is that!
He complicates things.

Bily! Bily!

Bily! Bily!

Bily...!

What's going on?

Chief Bily...!

Ghana has a bullet in the...

... in the feet.

Billy told me
Ghana was saying bullshit.

Somehow not respecting what he was
saying. So he shot him in the feet.

Shot!
And Ghana was my soldier.

Bily got a problem with Ghana.

I'm not gonna accept, baby!

I told him: Shit! Can you send
somebody to send him to hospital.

He says:
Nobody can. Only you.

I told him I cannot come.
It's really insecure for me.

He says: Lele, I love you.

I gave orders.
Everybody knows your car.

You're safe.
You can come.

He is by the chocolate colored door.

Ghana!

-Hello. I'll go check on him.
-Open the gate.

Try the other rock!

Good morning, Ghana.

Lele, my girl... friend.

Friend, not girl.

What's going on, Lele?
Everything okay?

Bily likes Lele so much.

He likes her.

This is for you.
Don't spend it on girls.

No, I won't give it to nobody.
I won't spend it on girls.

-It's for yourself.
-Not for girls.

-I know you.
-You know me?

I need money to eat,
not for girls.

I need it to live.

How do you know
I spend money on girls, Lele?

You don't give it
to them directly, but...

I don't give girls money.

I give money to the people,
not to girls.

He believes in voodoo shit.
Come on, fuck voodoo, man.

Fuck God.
Fuck voodoo, brother.

Fuck everybody, man.

Believe me, I believe
in my own finger.

I believe in that, baby, that!

I'm aiming to reach the National
Palace, throw Aristide in jail

or shoot him!

Today, in Haiti, we have terrorists,
drug dealers, criminals

acting and killing innocent people.

They killed more than 5,000 people.

Now they are back
to kill more people.

I spent ten years in exile,
ten years in the Dominican Republic

thinking about how
I could come back...

... come back to Haiti

to liberate the people
from the dictatorship of Aristide.

If Bush and the international
community knew exactly

what's going in Haiti, they would
abandon Aristide immediately.

My aunt is always upset
because I'm a Chimere.

We're all mean.
If you're mean, I'm mean.

If you do something to me,
I can do the same to you.

-Did you take my car?
-I'm not mean to you.

You're my mother.
I didn't steal it.

-I borrowed it, that's all.
-It wasn't borrowed.

-Not borrowed, what then?
-It was taken.

-I was in a hurry.
-You were in a hurry.

If I'm lying, I'll die.
But I'm not, so I can't die.

God in heaven is protecting me.
That's why I can't die.

That's from your voodoo priestess.

With this I can't die.

-But you don't like it?
-The doctor is coming.

Gabriel said, Boss, I'm gonna
be with you forever.

Everywhere you go, I will go
with you. I'm your bodyguard.

He's a stupid motherfucker.
He can't write his name.

His school is killing people, that's it.

Gabriel is my soldier.
Franzo is my soldier.

You see them niggas,
you got to run, baby.

This is Franzo's daughter.

Franzo, please. Stay cool now.
Don't get all hot, okay?

Stay cool like me.

Got a match?

Not like that. Don't...!
Just give it to me.

See, nigga? Don't play.

You fuck with us, you gonna die.
That's Franzo and Pac.

Let me hear it click, dog.

We know you have a temper.
Shit, man. Let's hear it.

Yes, thank you very much.
We heard it.

Franzo's a great guy.
Great guy.

Franzo will die. He's crazy.
He pulls his gun on me.

But Bily, you can't just say
Franzo's gotta die.

-Cut Franzo loose. He don't listen.
-He don't listen to nobody.

I told you, man.
He's gonna die like this.

He's all alone in CitÃ© Soleil.
No mother, no father. Only likes war.

No more fucking bullshit.
I'm gonna take his gun away.

What's going on, motherfuckers?

-What's going on?
-Yeah, 2pac.

Franzo, sweetheart.
I love you, you know that.

Lots of love. When I tell you
to do something, do it!

I would never ask you for something
that's not good for you.

You don't understand
what's going on.

You know me, Franzo.
I love you.

-They want to kill me.
-I know.

I don't want you to die.
If you die, I lose. Okay, partner?

2pac, my dream is
to have my own gang.

If Bily tries to fuck with me,
I'll pull my gun on him.

He needs to run if he sees me.

Know why you'll die?
Cause that's how life is, Franzo.

The more you kill,
the shorter your life becomes.

But 2pac, you know I have an Uzi.

Listen up, Franzo.

If you go looking for trouble,
you're gonna die.

You'll be dead real soon.
There's nothing to do.

Play the game good.
You're not playing it well.

Bullshit.
You're stupid, imbecile!

Franzo is a two-faced motherfucker.

He doesn't say fuck you to my
face, but he pulls his gun on me.

Yes, he doesn't respect you.

Everybody wants to kill him,
but they don't, because of me.

Franzo's a kid.
You have to pull his ears.

But you can talk to him, you know.

Franzo: <i>So kill me here, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Bily, I'm right here.</i>

<i>Come and kill me right here.</i>
<i>I'm ready to die, Bily.</i>

That's fucking bullshit.

I'll give him a bullet
so he won't do that again.

Come on. One bullet and then
you'll have to pay for hospital.

I won't send you any money.

-I already had to pay for Ghana.
-Why did you feel obliged to do that?

I can't let someone with
no money take a bullet.

-You don't have to kill anyone.
-But he doesn't respect me.

Give him a second chance.

No, I have to give him a bullet
to make him respect me.

Chiefs, chiefs, chiefs!
Respect, respect...

Who made me chief? You think
someone asked me to be a chief? No.

I get respect
because I respect people.

You think if you shoot him
in the leg, he'll respect you?

No need for respect. I'll make him
fear me and then kill him good.

<i>They say times are changing</i>

<i>If I had money</i>
<i>I'd be in Miami</i>

Bily's crazy, man.
Bily's crazy.

He knows who he's fucking with.

What is he doing with that M-14?

Give me that. What the hell is
Gabriel doing with that gun?

-But we should all have guns now.
-Get down now.

-Give it to me.
-No, 2pac, this is the only one.

I can't go without a weapon.
Do you want to kill me?

-Get down, right now.
-Don't do it, Bily. Bily!

Give the gun to 2pac.

Give it to him, right now!

Gabriel,
I'm gonna shoot you!

Go get him!

No reason to shoot!
Don't shoot, Bily!

I'm not scared, Bily!
Not scared of you, Bily!

Stay out of it, Franzo!

Bily wants to kill us!
Bily wants to kill us!

-Where is Bily going?
-Don't shoot him!

You can't do that!
You can't do that!

-Gabriel!
-2pac! 2pac! 2pac!

-Oh, 2pac!
-Give me that!

Okay, let's go! Let's go!

They just called me on the telephone.
Told me Gabriel is dead.

They shot him up in his neck.
With a shotgun.

I told him, don't go downtown.
I know he has enemies downtown.

Dead by a fucking cop.

Franzo was there with Gabriel.

Franzo told me, Boss, shit man,
I'm crying like a motherfucker.

Gabriel died in front of me.
I can't do nothing.

They asked me what the hell
I'm gonna do for the funeral

cause they know somehow
I'm in charge of that.

Fuck.

Save your life, you know.
Take another way.

I try to explain to them,
but they don't understand.

-What's happening?
-There's no power. They cut it off.

Let's go to the service place.

-Does he have...?
-Yeah, baby. He has a big generator.

In the house!
This is my town, baby!

I need the generator.
You know Gabriel was my boy.

I was told Wednesday.

I'm gonna shoot someone today.
Bullets are gonna fly.

If you don't go get our generator,
I'll make serious trouble.

I would never make trouble for you.
No, no, no, no.

Hey! Are you giving me shit?

No, no!
2pac, that's not it.

-Somebody already booked it.
-Booked it?

If I made problems for you,
I'll make it up to you.

I swear to God
we'll find a generator.

It's my town, baby.

It's like that.

<i>It's no lie</i>
<i>This is 2pac's dream</i>

<i>Corrupt and greedy</i>
<i>Thief. President</i>

Yeah, that's me and
my girlfriend, nigga.

Me and my angel, nigga.
Baby, please give me a kiss.

Black and white, nigga.
We love each other for real.

Yes, man, what's up?
That's yours?

-Lele, you will get that?
-No, I need to talk to you.

What happened?

Since not long, since
a few days, I have some guy.

And the guy is your brother.

So that's the situation now.

-Now you're joking.
-No, I'm not joking.

-What do you think about it?
-Me? To me, it's a joke.

-No, it's not a joke. Really.
-Yeah.

So Aristide go.
I told you, man.

That's what I wrote in my music.

I knew he had to go.
Get the fuck out of here.

That's why I'm happy, nigga.

We're here! We're here!

The President left,
but we're still here.

They're gonna come looking for us.

Guy Philippe said
we're the cause of all the trouble.

But me and five guys will
make him run like a thief.

Bily gave me a gun,
so I could go out and fight.

I'm ready for the war.

I want to say that

with a trembling voice

that this warm welcome
this morning...

... makes me feel very good.

Because I'm back in my country,
I'm with my people.

I have no problems with the police

not with the policemen
or with the people.

We have problems with the Chimeres
and the chiefs of the Chimeres

who are crazy, and have done
nothing for the country or the people.

From 1804 to 2004,
that's 200 years!

200 years of independence.
200 years!

What did you ask me?

We are the people of CitÃ© Soleil.

We fought hard to get
Aristide as our President.

Tell little Bush
we need three things.

The Haitian people
have three prayers:

School for our kids.
Food. Sleep.

We don't need peace.

We need the Chimeres to fight

the extravagant systems
right here in CitÃ© Soleil.

Look at us today.

I feel like killing you
to take your camera.

I'm satisfied we got rid
of the dictator.

We need to prevent
the destruction of Port-au-Prince.

The Chimeres are still around.

We are at the service of
the government to disarm them.

I saw the guy who gave the order
to Guy Philippe to go to La Saline

not to CitÃ© Soleil. They will make
the decision tomorrow at five

so you need to speak
with them before.

Cause they're afraid of you
and all your guns.

They don't know what you want...
if you are still for Aristide or not.

Okay, talk with Dread now.

Make a decision, but you should
negotiate or they may attack.

-No more Chimeres!
-Chimeres are nothing but trouble.

Hello, Guy.
How are you doing?

No, not at all. I'm in CitÃ©
Soleil with the chiefs now.

-I will pass you on.
-Hello?

I am Bily, you understand?

In CitÃ© Soleil, we are four chiefs.
We don't want no more violence.

We can guarantee
that the violence stops.

If we make it stop, it's not
cause people here are afraid

of the rebels,
it's cause people are gonna die.

It's always people from
CitÃ© Soleil who are the victims.

Now I lay down my weapons.
My hands are in my pockets.

No, I'm not afraid of being attacked.

I'm worried about my people,
I'm not worried about myself.

Before talking to you, calls started
coming from Lavalas members

who asked me to stay with them

to start a new rebellion
like in Gonaives.

But we'll stay cool as long as you
respect that we have rights too.

If you think you can disarm us

and then massacre us,
we won't tolerate that.

We're ready for war, but if it's
about stopping the violence

and for everyone
to be able to live in peace

and give jobs to the people

then we'll support anyone
who comes to power.

Hello?

Bravo, Bily. Shit!
You told Philippe.

-What do you think, Bily?
-What?

I don't know what you should do, but
you should give the old weapons.

You pretend you give, but you
don't give them your weapons.

You tell them you don't trust them

because everywhere they've been,
Africa, Eastern Europe

each time it has been a massacre.

You know, we come
to protect you, they say.

It's true they want to,
but then after...

I don't want my people to die,
my soldiers to die.

I know now it's not the time.

It's not the right time
to have enemies.

It's time to have friends,
not enemies.

My niggas, my people,
I care for their lives.

Yo, Clef.

Yeah, we've got guns in CitÃ© Soleil,
but we've got talents too.

People think we're the devil.
It's not true, man.

I said we gotta talk to Wyclef.
He can give us support.

Our story is your story.
CitÃ© Soleil respects you.

Only you sing with respect
for CitÃ© Soleil. Understand?

Like in the song,
<i>CitÃ© Soleil, don't be afraid.</i>

Do you know how many people have
guns in CitÃ© Soleil? Three thousand.

We've got three thousand soldiers.
They've got arms, big arms.

They promise we'll have security
when we give up the guns.

Then the rebels come looking for us,
what we're gonna do?

So we're gonna die.
Our family's gonna die.

We don't want that thing.

What we need? We need peace.
We don't want to fight each other.

We don't want no more people
die in CitÃ© Soleil

cause we die of hunger already,
why we gonna die by arms now?

<i>Aristide, five more years.</i>
<i>Aristide, five more years.</i>

<i>Justice for the little man is death</i>

<i>You're coming to my house</i>
<i>looking for resistance</i>

<i>Some people don't know</i>
<i>what I did for my country</i>

<i>They say, where is he?</i>
<i>He's a gangster</i>

<i>And all I tried to do</i>
<i>was free Haiti</i>

The military is here.
I don't want to be with you.

Fuck that shit, man!
No power in Haiti.

You see, what happened.
Power is a gun in Haiti.

If you don't have a gun,
no power.

-Big fucking problem.
-What?

They got Amaral.
They beat him up. The military.

-The military?
-Yes, the American forces.

Some snitches said Dread Wilmer
was going to see Amaral.

This morning they got Amaral and
beat him up to get Dread Wilmer?

Labanye knew Aristide would go. He
acts like he's not for Aristide no more.

Now Labanye can do what he
wanna do, man. You know?

Make a phone call: Hey, cop.
Dread went to Amaral's house.

Go get him for me, please.
Now Labanye is the fucking boss.

In CitÃ© Soleil, in one place,
there can't be two chiefs, never.

When you have two chiefs,
they always fight each other.

It's a game. Sometimes to lose,
sometimes to win

but I really want to win,
I don't want to lose.

If I lose, I die.
If I die, I lose.

No more Pac, fuck Pac.
They will forget me.

But if I go away to another country

still make my music,
they will always think about Pac.

-What's happening?
-Something's going on.

-Where?
-There was some shooting.

-Where?
-Lots of bullets.

You see, I'm chilling.
I just wake up in my bed.

And now I'm going to fight. For what?
I wake up in my bed, man.

Let me see.

Over here, this way.
It was over here.

Fuck your mother!

What is this shit?

Get in the car.
Come get in the car, man.

It's war.

Kill the motherfucker!

2pac!

Labanye and Pac are fighting.

Labanye and Pac.

I gotta get the hell outta here, dog.

If I stay, I'm going to die.

2pac is a motherfucker, man.
He is going back to jail.

Why do you want him to go back
to jail? It's worse than death.

He doesn't respect me.
Yesterday I lost my gun.

He has one gun and he had
50 Cent put it somewhere.

I tell 50 Cent to get the gun
so I can borrow it.

-And you would give it back?
-Yeah, cause he's not in CitÃ© Soleil.

My life is not okay.
All this happens to me cause of 2pac.

I'm coming down there, baby.
Okay? You're with me now.

Yes, I hear what you're saying.
I hear you.

Okay, just hide that gun.

Don't give it to him. If you do,
then you're not my friend.

Okay, baby. I love you.

Listen, I'm gonna put
a bullet in his ass.

If he tries to take that gun,
do what you have to do!

You hear me?
No matter what it is!

I don't have a brother any more.

Fuck Bily, man.
Lele, listen to my music.

Fuck him!

You see, me and 2pac,
we're never relaxed.

Every time, we get into a fight.

It's for 2pac I do what I do.

But if 2pac was not my brother,
I'd kill him already.

I always act like I trust him.

Always act like that.

But in my heart I don't trust him.

I don't really know
if he's my enemy or my brother.

And he has soldiers.
That's the big problem.

If I wanna kill Bily right now, I can!

Like I told you.
Him too. He's a chief.

If he wanna do something, he can
give the message to his soldiers

and I'll die and after,
he'll act like it's not him.

He will cry like a little baby.
It's like that, Lele.

We're Haitian, man.

Bily is trying to be the chief,
but everybody knows I am.

He is crazy!
They know who is chief. They know.

The only way for him right now
is to kill me.

He can't. Killing your brother
would be disgusting.

The people of Soleil 19
would never accept it.

Know why I gotta leave CitÃ© Soleil?
I don't want to kill my brother.

-It would be ugly. See what I mean?
-It would be ugly.

That's my problem. He wants to be
chief, so I let him be chief.

His problem is the other chiefs.
They will destroy him.

Now what's left is the hate.
It always destroys you.

I take care of myself,
but I know I'm gonna die.

One day I'll die,
but only God knows when.

Only God.

Hello, it's Lele.

It's true.
There's a warrant against you.

They want to make an example
and clean up before the UN arrives.

If you stay another day,
they're going to arrest you.

My name is LÃ©on Charles.
I am the Chief of Police in Haiti.

There is a hard wing.

The hardcore of the gangs

are identified as people like
Labanye, Amaral, Dread Wilmer

2pac, Bily.

We're looking for them.

We published pictures

of 30 gang leaders in the papers.

Earlier, the police
could not arrest them.

Now I have the power
to arrest whoever I want

committing any crimes
in the streets of Port-au-Prince.

So I have to leave Haiti,
but I don't know how.

Man...

Like Wyclef say, when the doors
close, you find another one open.

But it's not true. I find the door's
closed, I can't find another open.

Every door is closed.
For me, every door is closed.

All the doors, man.

The police caught Bily behind
the market. Let's go, Lele.

Lele, let's go please.

Damn those people.

Fuck them cops.

They catch my brother.
How I'm gonna be cool?

A lot of cops are not Lavalas.
They're for the opposition.

When they catch you,
you ain't got no chance.

You're gonna die.
He's gonna kill you, man.

My little brother's dead?

You think if I see a cop, I'm gonna
fuck with him? Play with him?

They're gonna get shot, dog.
Believe me!

Kill my blood? Kill you too,
motherfucker. It's like that, baby.

Niggas gonna die, man.

Fuck them cops. I'm ready to die.
We're gonna make war.

In front of the Americans, they say
they're gonna arrest you.

If the Americans aren't there,
they're gonna kill you.

That's the big problem in Haiti
since the beginning in Aristide.

When Aristide came back, he didn't
want to sit with the Macoute.

He made us Lavalas kill Macoute

and now that the opposition is back,
they're gonna kill Lavalas.

It's always like that. When the
opposition goes, Lavalas comes.

It's gonna keep killing, killing, killing.
Haiti will never be changed.

Now I gotta get some money
and leave this fucking country.

This is my brother. Shut the camera.
This is my brother, my cop.

He's going now,
to make a license for me.

Tomorrow, baby. If the license comes
tomorrow, we're okay, man.

Now it's only me, man.

Like I say, just me against the world.

I've got nothing to lose now, baby.

Nothing.

Just Taina.

Man.
If my mother was alive...

... good luck, my son.

Do a good thing.
Don't make me ashamed.

She was always like that,
don't make me ashamed.

Now she's dead.

She's in the sky for me, cause
she was a really good woman.

She's in the sky, man,
with the angels.

But me, I'm not gonna
be with my mom now. I know.

I know.

I'm scared, man.
Like tomorrow, I'll go away.

I got to go.

I will go.

No matter what, you gotta believe
in your destination, baby.

How is my life going to be?
I don't know.

I don't know.

Maybe good, maybe bad.
I don't know.

Lord knows.
