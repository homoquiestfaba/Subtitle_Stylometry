What?
Turn down the music.

Whatever. Yeah.
Hey.

Don't. Look<i>...</i>

Coz.
Yeah, what's up, coz.

Sorry, it's just... Entertaining.

I missed you.
How'd you know it was me?

I knew it was you.
This piece-of-shit car.

Hey, hey, hey.
This is not a piece of shit.

You should be happy
I have this car.

It means I'm taking care of myself.

Welcome to the Hamptons, coz.
Yeah, yeah. It's nice.

It's so nice.

First, I want you to know that
this is just a little party...

...so just be cool, okay?

What is this, another one of these
money, benefit functions?

What else are you gonna add
to the house, another wing?

Baby, look who's here.

Look what my kitty-cat dragged in.
Hey, baby boy, hey.

Good.
It's been a while.

Here, that's for you.
Thank you.

Everyone, this is Tracy Hutchison.
This is Sky's cousin from New York.

Tre, this is Emily,
Nancy and Charles.

How you doing?
Welcome to the Hamptons, Tre.

"Tracy," please.

Have a seat.
Thank you.

So, what brings you
from New York, Tracy?

A little summertime retreat?
No, I'm...

Tre works for
one of my father's magazines.

Yeah. I'm writing an article
for <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine...

...about hip-hop in the Hamptons.

And Sky here, she's gonna let me
crash at her place while I cover it.

Is there really
that much hip-hop here?

Ever heard of Summer G?
Rap mogul, self-made millionaire?

Dropped out of college,
started his own label.

Yadda yadda yadda.

Well, he just bought a place here
about a month ago.

Yeah, I'm waiting to be overwhelmed
with bouncing cars and do-rags.

Baby, that's West Coast.

Wait, he just bought
the old Vandercleef place...

...about a mile down the road.

Oh, really?

That close to Sky?

Did you know that?
No, no.

I don't really follow the hip-hop world
much anymore.

Well, he must never leave his house.
I've never seen him in town.

I heard that all of his bodyguards
are ex-convicts.

I heard that he used to be in a gang.
No, I don't think that's quite true.

Well, he's having his
Memorial Day party today.

So when I meet him, I'll see
if there's any truth to the rumors.

You know what I'm saying?
You know what I mean? All right?

Sky, why don't you and Chip
come hang out with me.

Thank you, no.
Come on, baby. I think it'll be fun.

Go out, party.
Do something, you know?

Come on there,
Mr. Hightower, loosen up.

Tre, give me a hand inside.
Excuse us a second, baby.

Can you bring everybody up?
Absolutely.

Come on, big boy.
Oh, I'm in trouble.

Isn't he great? I love this.
Oh, yes.

No, I don't even know these people.
No, they're from the zoning board.

I have to schmooze
to let them allow me...

...to build a tennis court
in my own backyard.

The struggle continues.
This is what I'm saying.

No, sounds rough. Sounds rough.

Why I didn't become a struggling
Bohemian like you, I'll never know.

It pays less money.
Oh, that's right. That's right.

No, no.

Tracy, we're boys, right?
You know what I mean. You're my boy.

Always have been.
Yeah, we boys.

I want you to do me a favor.
Tomorrow, I'm not going to work.

I'm gonna ride across town
to see an old friend of mine.

Who?
She's just an old friend.

But she has a single younger sister,
and I told her I'd bring you along...

...and you could keep
her sister busy for us.

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
So how's everything with my cousin?

Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, easy man.

No, first and foremost,
she's my wife, all right?

She is a friend, this woman.
Her sister's a pain in the ass.

Just come along and show everybody
that I actually do know ethnic people.

Ethnic people, huh?

No.

No, I can't do that.

All right. All right.

All right, I understand.

Hey, Tre...

...how's things at my father's
magazine for you?

Okey-dokey, I guess.

Okey-dokey?
What the fuck is that?

Yeah, all right, look.

Straight up. I mean, we boys.

Are you sleeping
with this girl, or what?

What did I say?

Okay, look. Now, I'm not hanging out
with you cats all day, okay?

I got a lot of work to do, as you know...
That's all I'm asking.

See, we're boys, Tracy.

So, what about tonight?
You going to that party?

Unless you and your pops
have an itinerary I need to follow.

Y'all wanted to go?
No.

As a matter of fact, go ahead and take
Sky with you if she wants to go.

You just keep an eye on her.

With all these roughnecks around.

Rapper types.

Do that for me?

You are my boy, Tracy Hutchison.

You're my boy.

Tre Hutchison, <i>Flow</i> magazine.
Tre, Tre.

It should say, "Hutchison."
I'm on the list. Thank you.

Hold on.
My plus one.

I'm with him.
Thank you.

No, no, I said three cases
of Cristal.

Tre? Tre Hutchison?

Hey, Adam Gordon.
Hey, how are you, man?

So glad you guys made it out.
Yes. This is my cousin, Sky.

Hi, great to meet you.
Listen, help yourself to a drink.

I'm gonna go find Summer, all right?
I love you. Thank you.

Not right now.
Adam, listen...

Daizy, I gotta find Summer.
You seen him?

Adam. I have an idea.
I wanna sing tonight.

We got a house full of people.
It's a private audience.

No press, no photographers.
Daizy, Daizy.

If Summer says you're not ready,
you're not ready.

Let me go find Summer now?
No, you know what?

You tell Summer
fuck rapping then, okay?

Lf he can't cut me a break...
You'll walk to another label.

That's right.
Daizy, there are other artists here.

Why do you deserve
the special treatment?

Do you really have to ask that?

Summer?

Hey, Summer, are you in there?

Yo, Summer, you there?

Summer?

That writer from <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine
is downstairs.

My advice? Parties are good
for business, mood swings are bad.

Tre?
Hello. Hey.

How's it going?
Yes.

Summer, very nice to meet you.
From <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

Yes. Thank you
for doing the interview.

Appreciate it.
Can't wait to give the fans a new...

Tre, is it?
Yes.

Right. Yes, interview B. Mo.
Where's B. Mo at?

Yo, B. Mo!
B. Mo! B. Mo!

I look forward to...
Yeah, I know.

But I need something to drink.

What's up, dog?
B. Mo, this is Tre...

...from <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

He wants an interview, dog.
Word?

All right. Okay.

You sing that song, "Let Me Lick
Your Toes and Make You Brunch?"

That song's the shit.

You don't understand.
It's so romantic.

Well, it came out a while ago.
You know, it's no big deal.

Makes me feel like a one-hit wonder
sometimes, know what I'm saying?

Well, ladies, it was really nice talking.
If you don't mind, excuse us.

All right.
Bye.

What's wrong?

I don't like when you do that.
What?

Refer to yourself as a one-hit wonder.

Look around you.
I haven't had a hit in two years.

All these people, they all got
hit songs out right now. I'm just not...

But you're not.
I wouldn't be with a one-hit wonder.

You're one of the largest-selling artists
on Summer's label...

...and I want you to act like it.

I'm just staying grounded, baby,
you know?

Mr. Summer?

Hi, Gene Underhill.

Hamptons Homeowners Association,
representing your neighbors.

We've been trying to contact you
about the noise level at your parties.

Which neighbor would that be?
Because I think they're all here.

Well, that's not really the point, sir.

Your parties are a constant source
of nuisance for your neighbors.

Now if you're unable
to contain them...

...the homeowners association will
have to respectfully impose a curfew.

Now, if you're unable to comply by<i>...</i>

I'm sorry?

What are you saying?
You require a permit, sir.

A party of this stature
requires permits.

Adam, do we have permits?
Yes, we have the permit.

Permit. Mr. Underhill,
it was a pleasure. Thank you.

Well, there's still the matter
of the noise and the nuisance.

Summer, how are you doing?

Look, I know it's mad hectic right now
with this great party and everything...

...but I was wondering, you know<i>...</i>

I'd like to introduce you to somebody.
My cousin, Sky.

Summer.

Sky.

It's been a long time.
How you doing?

Been well.
I'm sorry, wait a minute.

Y'all two know each other?
Yeah, we do.

We went to college together.
College?

Why didn't you tell me
anything, Sky?

I didn't think he'd remember.
It's been a long time.

Wait a minute. You went
to the Fashion Institute of Technology.

You went to
the Fashion Institute of Technology?

Yeah, I did.
What for?

Fashion.

Fashion, okay.
I just got a little startled. I'm sorry.

Did y'all two graduate?

Actually,
Summer never graduated...

...because he was so busy starting up
Royal G records in his dorm room.

And Sky never attended
graduation...

...because she ran off
with some cat to get married.

Okay.

Seems we know a lot
about each other, don't we?

Not really.
Not really.

You know, it was really nice of...

Okay. Well, nice party.
Thank you for inviting us.

I'm gonna go and get a drink.

Hey.
Hey.

How you doing?
Okay. I'm okay.

You like?
Yeah, it's pretty good.

You spent your money well, I guess.
Take a ride.

Here, we got some boats.

A nice little bar outside.

You got the Hamptons, baby.
You must love this.

It's all right.
It's all right?

Little different from Manhattan?
Yes.

So, what do you think here, Mr. G?

Does hip-hop have heart?

Let's talk about your cousin.

Why don't you tell me
about my cousin.

I mean, I'm not new, brother.
I saw you flinch.

Yeah, well<i>...</i>

Well, we were together
a couple of years back in school.

That's it.
Two years? What happened?

Maybe you should ask your cousin.

But it's not dead yet?

I mean, chemistry's still there, right?

No, it's dead.

I mean, for me, it's dead.

Yeah, but she left kind of abruptly,
you know.

Yo, dog, check this out.
This is why I brought you out here.

I haven't seen Sky in years.
I would love to catch up, you know.

I was wondering if you can arrange,
like, a rendezvous...

...so we can talk.

Bartender, can I get
a Jack and Coke, please?

Look, you know she's married.
Right? I mean<i>...</i>

I know she's married.
Married. So I can't do that.

I just don't feel comfortable. I can't.

Thank you.

You're serious?

Yeah, it's getting late.

You got this? Thanks.

What's wrong, baby?

I don't know.

I'm not happy.

Why, what's wrong?

This is Summer G's house.

I want my own house.

It's only for the summer.

After next year,
I'll drop my album.

We'll marry.

I'll buy you a house.

House of your dreams.

Hey.

Hey.

What happened to you?

How was the rest of the party?
Anybody bust a cap on a sucker?

Cap on a sucker.

What do you know about that?
I know a lot about a lot of things.

Don't try to start that perfect-life
bullshit here. Have a seat.

Okay.

What was up with you
and Summer G?

You loved him?

Cheated on you?

Put his hands on you?
No, nothing like that.

Okay, drugs?

He did drugs. Drugs.

He sold a little weed in college...

...but just to get by, you know.
Nothing big.

Wait a minute,
you smoked weed?

I'd smoke weed now if I had some,
but Chip thinks it's unladylike, so<i>...</i>

Well, listen, anyway.

Well, what was it? Come on.
What was it?

Come on. Come on, coz.
Talk to me.

I mean, I see you in pain.
I don't wanna talk about it, Tre.

Chip knows about you
and Summer?

Chip knows that 10 years ago...

...he stole me away from a guy named
Greg at college. They never met.

Wait a minute.

You mean, 10 years ago...

...you cheat on a struggling artist for
a businessman who buys you gifts?

You know what, Tre?
Fuck you. Fuck you!

You don't know what happened!
Okay, okay, Sky.

Hey, Sky, come on.

I'm sorry.

All right? Look, I'm your cousin,
and I love you.

I mean, I got your back,
no matter what.

I just want you to be happy. You.

Well, I was there, Tre,
and I know what happened, okay?

So it's over.

God, look at you.

It isn't over, is it?

I'm going to bed.

Bill, you cut me, baby.

I had that. Do you see?
I had that there.

I need you to watch what you're doing.
I mean, damn, Bill. Get with it now.

Shit.

Hey, Ladara, girl, I gotta tell you.

This shit, this is the life.

I mean, girl, you got a house
in the Hamptons, on the water.

And you got this shit
for the whole summer.

How did a Brooklyn heifer such as
yourself swing something like that?

Yeah, now. Anything's possible
when you got the hookup.

Get that.
Oh, is that right?

That's all.

Something on the tables, son.
Something on the tables, all right.

Hey, Shelly.
Shelly, I don't want no steaks.

Give me some corn
with lots of butter and lots of pepper.

And some more E&J.
Some of that Easy Jesus.

Get all that?

Oh, goodness.

So how are you doing, Tre?
You having a good time?

Oh, it's "Tracy."

And, yes, I'm having a good time.
I'm having a good time.

Just feel kind of silly.

I came here to check on my man,
and it just... I don't know. I feel stupid.

Don't worry about it.
No, no. He needs to be checked on.

His trifling ass.

So I hear you're a photographer.
No, I'm a writer.

I write for <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

What? For real?
Yeah.

Shit, that's my shit.

I got a subscription, I got covers
all along my station at work.

I mean, yo<i>...</i>

So, what, you been meeting
a lot of celebs and shit?

Yeah, yeah. Right now, I'm doing
an article on Summer G.

No.

Hey, Shelly.
What?

Bring Chip his steak.
We in the middle of a game now.

I ain't bringing him shit.

He ain't my man.

Ain't yours neither.

Hey, Tre.

Hey, Tre, I heard Summer G is
second cousin to the devil.

And that's how he got
so successful.

Baby, can you please
not say stuff like that?

I mean, people gonna think
you're retarded and shit.

I'm gonna have to get back to you
on that one there, Bill.

I'd like some of that steak, honey.

I need something to soak up
some of this E&J in my system.

I'm gonna have diarrhea
like a motherfucker.

Jesus come easy in a bottle.

Jesus come quickly.

That's Summer G.
That's Summer G?

That's Summer G's new joint on.
That's Summer G's new joint, y'all.

That's my song.
You need to turn that shit up, baby.

You, come over here and dance.
Get up and dance with me a little.

Oh, so you can't
dance with me, huh?

Everywhere I look
they're talking about Summer G.

Now I gotta hear this garbage
on the radio? I don't wanna dance.

You can fuck me,
but you don't wanna dance with me?

And I can rent you a house
in the Hamptons too.

Sit down and relax.
Come on.

Lf I was your wife...
Don't talk about my wife.

You'd wanna dance with her.
So just pretend I'm Little Miss Sky.

Because I know you're thinking
about me when you're fucking her.

Chip!
Don't put your fucking hands on me.

Don't ever put your hands
on my sister again...

...you hear me,
you bitch-ass fucking faggot?

Just stay out of this, Shelly.

Get your ass on the other side
of town, motherfucker.

Put your hands on my sister again...

...I will stab you in the dick
with a plastic spoon, you hear me?

I don't give a fuck
what house you own.

Nigga, I'll burn this bitch up
with your ass up in it.

I'm sure it's the E&J.
E&J makes a nigga short with me.

Your wife might like it
when you smack her around...

...but we from Brooklyn, bitch.

Ladara!
Come on.

Come on.
Ladara!

Can't believe she's gonna
fuck that nigga...

...with blood coming out
of her mouth.

Damn.

Look, I gotta go.
Where you gotta go?

I got a son at home, waiting.
I know, I know.

I'm sorry about this whole Chip thing.
It's not your fault, all right? I'm out.

I can make it up. Summer's having
a party with his children.

Bring your son.
I'll try to make it happen. I'm sorry.

I'll do it.

So here's the deal, Tre.

From this point on,
every interview I give, I give to you.

It's yours, exclusive.

If you can make this happen.

Look, I'm not doing this
for any interview.

I'm doing this because I want to.

But deal.

Just promise me this isn't any,
you know, revenge-stalker...

...l- can't-live-without-my-baby
type of thing, you know.

No, look...

...the thing is, Sky and I
lived together for two years.

Okay, I thought I was gonna marry
the girl.

But I find out
she was playing on me with<i>...</i>

Anyway<i>...</i>

I kind of just lost it.
You know, I called her.

She wasn't there,
so I left her a message.

She never returned that message,
so I went over there.

She moved.

Without giving me a reason.

Without saying goodbye. Nothing.

Man, I just...
I just had to know why, man.

I just have to know the truth.

Yeah.

So you're telling me that
after 10 years...

...this truth, it still matters?

I mean<i>...</i>
Yes, it still matters.

Leave now?
Craig, I'm not leaving.

I'm just going to Dierdra's
for a few days.

I just need a little time
to breathe.

All right. It's cool.

Baby, you mind if B. Mo
and Daizy come with us?

Just tag along for the ride?

Fine. You know, Craig, here I am,
once again putting my needs second...

...so that I can babysit for you.

But fine.
Nicole, please.

B. Mo and Daizy.

Why are there two coffee cups
in the truck?

What?
You heard me.

Why are there two coffee cups?

Who did you have in here?
Nobody. What are you talking about?

I got a cup of coffee
before I went to the gym...

...and I got a cup when I came out.
What is wrong with you?

Yo, yo, yo, let's go.
Come on now.

I need me a fish sandwich.

You got a light?
Yeah.

Can you believe the last three delis
that we've been to don't sell Newports.

What kind of damn-ass place
don't sell fucking Newports?

It's the number-one brand and shit.
Fucked-up bullshit.

But I told you.

I told you, we jumped right
in the fucking TV set.

Look around.

Where the colored folks at?
This is fucking Mayberry right here.

Yo. Yo, yo, Craig, stop the car, nigga.
Black people! Black people!

Hey, yo, son.

Hey, yo.
Hey, yo, dog.

Yo.

Hey, yo, dog. Do a brother a favor.
Where I can scoop some Ides?

I'm sorry?
Son, I need a 40 of the Saint.

But a deuce will do.

I'm sorry, I don't have any money.

What the fuck are you talking...?
No, no, no, bro.

Malt liquor, B. Booze?

That's what we talking about.
And a McDonald's, okay?

Malt liquor?
Man, this ain't Harlem.

Harlem?

Wait a minute, honey!
Listen, we're from Brooklyn, okay?

East New York, baby. Get it right.

And I'm straight out of Bed-Stuy,
and I'm a peaceful brother...

...but I will bust a cap in your fake
Bryant Gumbel-wannabe ass...

...on some bullshit like that!

You're B. Mo Smoov, right?
Word.

And you're Daizy Duke?
Yeah.

And you're Craig Lewis?

Holy shit. Give me five dollars.
She knows me.

Five dollars.
What?

We up in the Hamptons.

There's a McDonald's and
a 7-Eleven off Route 27.

You'll find all you want there.
You got that?

All right.
Good looking out, mama.

Okay?
White folk in the Hamptons?

They're representing!

We blowing the fuck up!

Where Brooklyn at?
In the house!

Where Brooklyn at? In the house!
Where Brooklyn at?

We're blowing the fuck up!

Sky.

Hey, Sky?

Can we turn this down a little bit?
I thought you didn't like it.

It's rap.

Oh, buddy, you tell me.
How was work?

Sarcasm aside, he loved it.

Great.

Good thing there's a Merrill Lynch
branch near the Hamptons, huh?

Yeah, yeah.

Babe...

<i>...</i>we need to talk.
What about, baby?

Babe, I need you
to be honest with me...

...or I'm gonna go crazy.

Just tell me.

Tell you what?
Just fucking tell me, Chip.

Okay, could you not use profanity.

You are my wife.
You are too beautiful for that.

My wife doesn't use profanity, okay?

Just fucking tell me
or let me go?

I don't know what you're asking me,
I really don't...

...but we're okay, you and me.

Right?

We're okay.
You are... Look at me.

You are my everything.

I love you.

I've always loved you.

Summer.

Summer.

Summer.

Summer.

Hey, Daizy, what's up.
Hey.

Summer?

Morning.

What's up?

Tracy, about yesterday<i>...</i>

Yeah, I know it looked bad.

Your cousin and I, we have problems.
And everybody's got problems.

But they're our problems.

Just like I wouldn't understand
problems...

...you might have
in my father's magazine...

...I wouldn't expect you to
understand problems...

...I might have in
my marriage with Sky.

Are we on the same page?

Okey-dokey.

Okey-dokey.

Okey-dokey.

I'm off to the office, Tracy.
See you this afternoon.

See you.

Dog, I'm saying, we were just
chilling at the red light.

Minding our own business.
What?

And the white chick gave
us the shout out.

The white chick.
Okay.

Dog, it blew my mind, kid.
We blowing up, Summer.

We are blowing up.
And everybody can see that.

Yeah, yeah, me too.

So, what do you guys want?

I wanna take it to the next level.

I wanna start producing
my own beats.

Right. And, Summer, baby,
I need to stop rapping...

...because you know I can sing.

Produce. Sing.

All this because some
white chick recognized you.

Summer, our audience is expanding.
We need to too.

B. Mo, you need to show me
some responsibility.

And, Daizy, it's getting there,
but your voice is not there yet.

Summer, no disrespect, dog...

...but that's the bullshit.

Who the hell is that?

With no ring on her finger.

<i>Vogue.</i>

Excuse me?
<i>- Vogue.</i>

You in this week's <i>Vogue.</i>

Oh, and I suppose you read <i>Vogue</i>?

Hey, hey, I'm a well-rounded,
educated, sophisticated brother.

I read lots of things.

Yeah, all right.

I was in this week's <i>Vogue.</i>
That's what I'm saying.

I knew that. And I suppose
you know who I am?

No.

You joking, right?
I'm B. Mo Smoov.

Straight out of Bed-Stuy.

You know, I think I heard you
on the radio this week.

Talk to me.

You looked a lot taller on the radio.

Pretty young lady has jokes.

Can't believe you're funny
and fine.

I'm sorry, can I offer you
something to drink, Ms. Mommy?

You know what?

My name is Shelly, okay?

And I don't drink.

Now, why don't you take a walk
around the party...

...see if you can find another mommy
worth bothering.

And if you can't,
you come back here to me.

Respectfully.

Oh, and by the way, player...

<i>... Vogue</i> is a monthly publication,
not a weekly.

I knew that.

Fine motherfucker.

I know what I got.
Five minutes. I know.

Can you open the door?
No, you know how to open a door.

Come on. Let's go.

Tracy and Sky, what a surprise.

Five minutes. Come on.

Tracy.
Adam, how we doing there?

Sky.
Hey, Adam.

Hey, what's up, Tre. Sky.

How you doing?
All right.

All right.
Listen, why don't we go inside.

I got Daizy waiting for you to talk to.

Daizy Duke, right now?
We hooked that up for you.

Come on, let's go there.

Hey.

Hello.
Sky.

How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?

Doing well.
So, what's going on here?

Brought some kids out
from my old neighborhood...

...invited some kids from here,
threw a little party.

Kind of a cultural-awareness
kind of thing.

Cute.
Yeah.

Okay, well, I gotta go.
So I'll see you later.

Let's go for a walk.

Okay.

<i>Hey, it's Nicole.</i>
<i>You hit me on my cell phone.</i>

<i>So leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll hit you back.</i>

What's up, Nicole? It's me, Craig.

Just wanted to invite you to a little
barbeque over at Summer's house.

Where you been at?
I called you at Dierdra's...

...cell phone, voicemail.

Call me when you
get a chance, all right?

Peace. I love you.

I have a question for you.

Really? Well<i>...</i>

It ought to be good, you've had
a lot of time to think about it.

Why'd you leave?

Is that what this is all about?
Because if it is, I'm out.

Okay?
Yeah, yeah, well, hold on, just<i>...</i>

Why'd you leave?
Why were you so angry all the time?

Angry? I wasn't angry.

Really?
Yeah, really.

Is that why you left,
you thought I was angry?

This is ridiculous.
Why am I even here? I'm going.

No, no, Sky,
just answer this question...

...and I promise
I will leave you alone.

You can do what you do,
I'll do what I do.

Why did you leave me for Chip?

Can we go discuss this somewhere
privately if we're gonna talk?

Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come on, right this way.

What's up, Daizy?
Nothing.

Private enough?

Yes. Thank you.

Good.

From the first moment
Chip saw me...

...he let me know
he'd do anything for me.

It felt so good, because I'd
come home to you at night...

...and you were so angry
about your day...

...that you couldn't even
listen to me.

And here he was taking me
to plays and picnics.

And he listened to me when
I needed to cry about you.

Did he give you money?

Yeah. No, no.

He helped me.

And I didn't take it at first.

But here was this man...

...I didn't know him,
I didn't live with him...

...I didn't even love him...

...and here he was, offering me
his friendship and his support...

...because I had no one.

Do you know how
that made me feel?

Sky, you were lying to me.

You're sitting here telling
me in one ear...

...that you're going out
with your girlfriends.

In the other, my boys are telling me
that you're out with Chip.

Do you know
how that made me feel?

Okay, what? So you didn't
step up because I was lying...

...and I was lying because
you didn't step up. So what?

So what?
The point is...

...I was unhappy
when I was with you, Summer.

And you didn't do anything
to make me feel better.

I didn't do anything?
Everything I did was for you, Sky.

Trying to make you happy.
You know, whatever.

Look, just tell me.
Is that what it was about?

Him buying you things,
taking you places?

Just stop it, okay?

Is that what you think?
It was about the money?

That's never been important.
That's always been your own issue.

Okay, I left you because
I stopped believing in you.

There.

Is that what you needed to hear?

I'm just not believing it.

You know, I never wanted
to be apart from you.

Listen, this world I built...

...it was for you.

So I can prove to you that...

...you know, I could be that man,
that I am that man...

...that you wanted me to be.

I never gave up hope that one day
that we'll be together.

Hey.

I ain't never gonna stop
believing in you.

I ain't never gonna stop.

No matter what you think,
Summer...

...you have to know that
I loved you so much.

You need to know that.

I loved you too, Sky.

I know.

I know that now.

<i>Sky.</i>

Hey, baby.

Sky.

Half day today.

Hey, girl.

Hey, look here, sweetness.

Can I help you?
Yeah.

My name's Chip Hightower.
My wife is inside.

I can't let you in.

Why the hell not?

You got two choices.

You can leave now,
or right fucking now.

Get out of my way. Hey, man.
Get your hands off the suit.

You gonna pay for this suit?
Hey, it's okay.

Ramon, he's with me.
Chip, come on.

Sky is waiting.
Hello, Ramon.

It's your lucky day, baby.
It's unlocked.

You ready?

Hey, Chip.
Hi.

I'm glad you're here.

Now I only have to give two
introductions at the same time.

Summer G, this is
Sky's husband, Chip.

I mean, Mr. Chip Hightower.

Chip Hightower.
Pleasure to finally meet you, brother.

Heard a lot about you.
Daizy, thanks for showing Chip in.

<i>Fuck you.</i>

Please, have a seat.

It's funny, Summer G and Sky
know each other...

...from back in the old college days.

FIT.

I don't want my wife
socializing with gangsters.

Gangsters?
Oh, God, Chip.

Well, Sky, I think somebody
should be honest here.

Now, I've read about
your little rap lifestyle...

...and I know what goes on in it.

I am not comfortable
with my wife being a part of it.

At least I can be
upfront about that.

Look, Chip, come on.

We don't have to believe
everything written in the press.

You wanna tell
me about the press?

So it's all a bunch of lies now, Tre?
Is that what it is?

I can't speak for the press...

...but as for my intentions,
they're completely honorable.

Always have been.

Always have been?

Then maybe you can tell me
why my wife finds it necessary...

...to hide a photo album of you
under the bed I sleep in.

Well, I don't know, Chip.
Like you said, she is your wife.

I've had enough of this.

If you wanna sit here and talk
about our personal business, fine.

But I'm leaving.

I'm leaving, Chip.

You have a nice day.

You too.

Oh, come on, I owe you, Tre.

Come on, Summer.

Tre, I owe you.

Summer, you told me you just wanted
to talk to my cousin.

That's what I agreed to.

Please, don't put me in the middle
of a situation...

...I'm gonna regret ever again.

Damn.

Sky.

You gotta tell me something here...

...or I'm gonna lose it.

Do you love this guy?

Do you wear condoms when
you fuck your ho's?

Do you love this man?

Do you wear condoms?
Don't fuck with me.

First of all, if I were a single man
and you weren't in my life, Sky...

...then, yes, I would.
Do you love this man?

Well, if I was a single woman
and I weren't in your life...

...then, yes,
I would love another man.

Again, Mr. Hightower,
I am truly sorry.

Please, send me
the dry-cleaning bill.

Gene, it's all right, I've got 50 more
where these came from.

Hey, Gene, Gene.

How's the...? How's the good fight?

Sorry?
You know, the Summer G guy.

You get him kicked
off the block yet?

That's what you guys
are trying to do, right?

We're not trying to get
anybody kicked off the block.

Yeah, cut the bullshit.
What's the problem?

Well, I don't know what you're
talking about. There is no problem.

No, no, no.
He has all his proper permits.

He's keeping his parties contained.

He's respectful of his neighbors.
Respectful?

Gene, this motherf...

Gene, this guy is
coming on to my wife...

...every chance he gets.

Now, how's that
for your fucking respectful...

Excuse my language.
No, that's all right.

I'm sorry, I just wasn't aware.
I'm sorry.

Know what he did
when I confronted him?

He threatened me.
He threatens me with a gun.

The guy has
an armed fortress in there.

Bodyguards running around
with automatic weapons.

I'm afraid to walk in public
with my own wife.

Well, Mr. Hightower,
you've gotta go to the police for this.

There's nothing that
the homeowners association can do.

The police, they need proof.
I need you.

I need you to close him down
and get him the hell off my block.

I'm terrified of him.

And now he's turned everybody
around here, including you.

Lf it were your wife...?
All right, Mr. Hightower.

Just calm down.
I'm calm.

All right, now look.

The chief of police
is a friend of mine.

And he is a member of
the homeowners association.

I can put a call in
to him to keep an eye out.

But I'm afraid there's
nothing we can do...

...unless you get Mr. G
to threaten you in front of us.

Well, I can do that.

Okay, okay.

I'll call him right now, okay?

Thank you, Gene.

No, no, really, I'm frustrated too.
Let's go.

No, no.

Oh, Summer.

I want you to know
that I've realized...

...that I made a big
mistake 10 years ago.

I left the man that I loved
more than anything...

...because I stopped believing
that he loved me.

And now we have one more chance
to make right in our 30s...

...what we did wrong
in our 20s, right?

Right.

So you're ready to leave Chip?

If I leave my world,
can you leave yours?

That's funny. What?

Sky, wait.

Now, I built this world for you.

I wanna share it with you.

Then show me what
I'm worth to you, Summer.

Look, it makes no sense
for us to give this up.

Remember
those three little words.

For me.

Otherwise, we're gonna lose
like we did before.

I gotta go.

Call me...

...later...

...tonight.

<i>Does hip-hop have heart?</i>

<i>Hell, yeah, hip-hop has heart.</i>

Summer G believed in me
when no one else would...

...and signed me to his record label.
You know what I'm saying?

That's where the heart is.

Every kid out there on the streets
struggling to get his...

...that's where the heart is.

Now<i>...</i>
Wait.

There's some shit Summer
does with his business...

...that I just wouldn't do
if I was running things.

Oh, really?
Word is bond.

If you don't mind,
can we go back on the...?

Sure, go back there.
Thank you, thank you.

Back in the day,
hip-hop's passion and heart...

...was heard through the lyrics.

Now the industry has become
one big commercial endorsement...

...and verses of product placement.

You know, I mean, cars, jewelry.
Word.

I guess what I'm asking is,
does today's hip-hop have heart?

Absolutely. Know what I'm saying.

It's still coming from the ghetto,
right from the gut.

You know what I'm saying?
Nowadays, it's just more outward.

We were talking about rats,
and roaches and cracks...

...in the ghetto back in the day.
Now we out of the ghetto.

Know what I'm saying? Now it's time
for us to show some upward mobility.

With fancy cars and what
you call bling-bling, diamonds?

If you can afford it.

What's up, players and playettes.
Oh, what is this?

Man, you know how
I'm doing these days.

Who did you rob?
Hey, bro, nobody.

I'm just upgrading my style a bit.
Know what I'm saying?

Now, come on, come on, gather round.
You too, come on, man. Gather round.

I'm gonna ask Nicole
to be my wife, yo.

Word?
Internal clarity.

Excellent. The whole nine.
They broke it down for me.

Four carats, baby.
That shit is fly, dog.

And it ain't over.
Big step, Craig.

It's not over. Thanks, man, thanks.
But it's not over. Step outside, y'all.

Because the brother's
blinging from all angles.

Bling-bling.

That's right, y'all.
Brother going out like that?

That's what I'm saying.
You know, you know.

So, what do you all think?

I got three words for you, baby.
What's that?

Recipe for disaster.

I like the rims, though.
What's she talking about?

Okay, let's see,
I saw Nicole today...

...having lunch in this fancy restaurant
with this lawyer dude, all right?

Lawyer dude? What you talking about,
lawyer dude?

You get his name?

Peter<i>...</i>

Peter Carlyle.

He's a friend of my lawyer's,
so he's been to a few parties out here.

I think he's listed.

Please don't let this be happening.

What's going on?

Looks like Nicole has been creeping
around town with another dude.

Didn't tell him.

Oh, really?
Yeah, really.

Must have slipped her mind.

Look, if I may interject, Craig.

Craig, look, she's just having
lunch with her lawyer.

There's no big deal.
Yeah, word up, dog. That's real, man.

Come on, what's the beef, son?

What are you all,
stupid or something?

Y'all know better than that shit.
Craig, you all right?

Just crazy, brother.

Hey, Craig, you look nice.
Nicole's not here.

Okay, well, I have something really
important I wanna ask her tonight.

I'm not trying to play myself.

I just need to know...
I'm sorry, Craig.

I can't have this conversation with you.
You need to call her cell phone.

I just...
I'm sorry. Just call her cell phone.

Okay.

You fucked him
in my home, Sky?

You brought him into my house,
and you fucked him?

What the fuck is that?

Those aren't mine.

Oh, shit. Damn! Sky! Sky!

What the fuck, Sky? Jesus.

If you ever put your hands
on me again...

...I swear to God, I will kill you.

Do you hear me?

Do you hear me?

Do you hear me, Chip?

You would shoot me right now,
wouldn't you?

You would kill me?

What happened to us?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, God. I'm so confused.

I'm so sorry.

Look, I know I fucked up
in the past...

...I am willing to do
whatever it takes...

...to make this right,
because I don't wanna lose you.

I just... I've made a mess
out of everything.

And I'll make it right.

I just don't wanna...
I don't wanna lose you.

<i>- Hello.</i>
Hello.

It me. I just wanted to hear your voice
before I went to bed.

And also to say I cannot wait
to see you tomorrow.

<i>I don't think it's gonna happen</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

Okay, well, that's cool.
That's cool.

So day after that? That'll be fine.

<i>I don't think so.</i>

<i>I don't wanna hang up on you,</i>
<i>but I have to go now, okay?</i>

Oh, okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

Come here, girl. Come here.

Give me a second.

Tre?

Hey, brother.

I know it was you who set up the first
meeting between Summer and Sky.

I want you the fuck out
of my house now.

Chip?

Yeah, baby.

Yo, fellas.
Nicole's cheating on me, man.

Straight up. She's going to fucking
dinners, movies, all kinds of shit, man.

Oh, shit.
Word.

I don't even know what to do, man,
whether to be sad or angry...

<i>...</i>or what the fuck to do.
Fuck yeah, get angry.

See, this shit
happened to me years back.

This motherfucker's crazy,
trying to take somebody's woman.

You know where
this motherfucker lives?

Hell, yeah. He's listed.
I got the remedy.

Right there.
You sure?

Yeah, baby.

See, this the Summer
I'm talking about.

Know what I'm saying?
Fuck that businessman bullshit.

Good to be back.
Let's beat this nigga's ass.

Fuck yeah.

That's what I'm talking about.

What's going on?

Nicole's fucking some other cat.
She's giving away the pussy for free.

So we're gonna kick
that motherfucker's ass for free.

Hold on now, all right, you guys?
Come on, cool. Come on.

Think about this rationally, all right?

Now, Craig, if Nicole likes this guy,
then kicking his ass...

...is not gonna lead you two down
the road to proper reconciliation.

What the fuck does that mean?
Nothing, let's go.

Hey, hang on. Hold it. Summer.

This is not the kind
of press you want right now.

Dog, you don't need this.
It's me and Nicole, I'll take care of it.

Yo, Craig, fuck that.
Listen to me.

You feel that stuff pumping
through your veins right now?

It's anger. Use it.

Don't let anyone
take anything from you.

It's time to handle your business, boy.
Handle your business.

Handle my business, man.

I got it.

Handle my business, fellas.
All right.

Get me Tre.

Summer.

You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Come here.

I need you to call her.

Now!

Hey, Sky.

Look, I just... Don't... Don't hang up.

Okay? Just hold on.

Hold on.

Sky, it's me.

Look, I need to see you.

Well, I'm throwing
something tomorrow...

...and I'm making
a special announcement...

...and I need you to hear it.

At 11... 11:30?

Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

She'll come.

I love you.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Now it's your turn.

Chip! Chip!

Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you for fucking doing this to me!

Go. Drive!
You bitch! You fucker!

Bitch, shut the fuck up, bitch!
Fuck this shit! I don't give shit...

Hey, what are you doing in here?

Shouldn't I be asking you
the same thing?

What are you, living here now?
No, no, no.

I'm not living here, Craig.
But, baby, why are you here?

Come on.

Craig, what are you doing here?

Nicole.

Baby, I love you so much.

Nicole, will you marry me?

Get up. Get up!

I can't even go to Dierdra's without you
running behind me checking on me.

And coming here?
Baby, it's been three years.

What do you
need to go to Dierdra's for?

What do you need space for
breathing room or any of that shit?

Baby, I love you.
Love is not enough, Craig.

It is not enough.
And you know what?

I don't even think you know
how to love me.

And I have given up hope believing
that you will know how to love me.

Who the fuck is this?
Peter.

Peter? This is fucking Peter?
Peter, baby, just go back inside.

What are y'all, fucking now?
Go back inside.

No, don't go back inside.
Go back inside.

You answer my question.
This doesn't have to do with you.

What are you, fucking my woman?
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

Stop!
Motherfucker!

You know what, go home!

Go back to Summer G's house, Craig.
Don't bring this shit here!

You know what?
I'm not doing this with you anymore.

Go home!
Oh, please.

Please don't throw
everything we built...

...for a fucking one-night stand.

What's it been, a week, a month?

A year.

A year.

Now go home.

Go back to Summer G's house.

Gene.

Chip Hightower.

Yeah.

If you can guarantee me that you'll be
at Mr. G's house with the police...

<i>...</i> I believe I can give you that reaction
that you very much need to see.

Well, I'm more concerned about you,
Mr. Hightower. Are you all right?

Now, don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine.

I'll give you a call tomorrow.

Shelly. Shelly.

Good evening.
Good evening.

How are you?
I found this along the way.

B. Smoov, you forgot I don't drink.

I knew that. I knew that.

It's water. Here's another water.

So you enjoying yourself
at this fine party?

Summer sure has a lot of friends.

Yeah.

You think he's happy?

Yo, with all this,
who needs happiness?

Happiness is one
of God's greatest gifts.

Something I keep
trying to tell my sister.

You know, sometimes
happiness is so hard to find.

Happiness, real happiness.

It's God's orgasm.

Wait, let me ask you
a personal question.

Do you experience
this God's orgasm?

Daily.
Daily.

My kind of woman.

Fucking bitch!

What the fuck is wrong
with that bitch?

Fucking playing me?
You wanna fucking play me?

I'll show you who can fucking play!

Listen, about the whole situation...
Tre, now is not the time or the place.

She's here.

Hello, hello, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

Hope you all are having a good time.
Yeah!

Good, good, good.

Stick around. I think B. Mo is gonna
do something for everyone later.

You know it. You know it.
Thank you.

Good. Well, I called
everyone out tonight...

...because I do have
a special announcement to make.

Well...

...it's pretty much gonna change
everything the way you know it.

Well, there's no easy way to say this,
so I think I'll just say it.

I'm leaving the business.
What?

Goddamn.

What?
No way!

Yes, I'm giving it all up...

...for the woman I love.

The love of my life, actually.

My soul mate.

Thanks.

Happiness...
Happiness depends on it.

As for me, I would like to thank you
personally for supporting my dream.

My artists...

...I'll miss you.

And I love you. Thank you.

Let's go.

Sky. Chip.

Thanks for coming.

Why don't we go upstairs to my office
where it's quiet for us to speak?

Hey, Chip. Hey, baby.
We need to talk.

What are you doing here?
Tre invited me.

Tre? Tre, Tre, come here.
Come here.

You invited her here?
Yeah.

Well, you can deal with her.
We need to... We need...

Chip, I'm glad you
could make it, brother...

...because I'd like to do
this face to face.

Thing is, I'm in love with your wife.

She's in love with me.

We wanna live the rest
of our lives together.

I'm sorry.

Summer, I came here to let you know
that that's not happening.

My husband and I
have been making...

...some big mistakes
over the last couple of weeks...

...but we've been talking,
and we're gonna work things out.

We're gonna rebuild
our relationship.

Summer, I'm married.

I've made a commitment to that,
and I'm gonna stick to it.

I'm sorry.

All right. Now you heard
what my wife said.

Daddy's home.

So you stay the hell
away from my family.

Whoa, whoa, Sky, Sky. Please.
This is a joke, right?

Your mind must be clouded.
You remember the things we said...?

Mr. G, the fact of the matter is,
I am not a saint.

I made plenty of mistakes.

So that's why I'm willing to forgive that
you ever put your hands on my wife.

This time. Next time,
I'm not gonna be so forgiving.

Yo, dog.

I'm not gonna get angry.

Look, me and Sky have something
you probably couldn't fathom.

You don't know what you
stepped in the middle of.

No, you have no idea
what you stepped in the middle of.

Mrs. Hightower?

Come on.

No. No.

How does a brother
get his car around here?

Sky. Sky, don't do this.

Shut up, friend! Sky.
Hey, she still loves you.

So I want you to remember that
when you're fucking one of your ho's.

Because I'm gonna damn sure
remember when I'm fucking my wife.

Come on, man. What you gonna do?

Here we go.

Nothing. What could you do
10 years ago?

Nothing. Because you
will always be a broke, ghetto...

...punk-ass, wannabe-me bitch.

Come on.

Let him go!

Come on, Summer.
Now! Let him go!

Let him go.

Sky, baby<i>...</i>

Sky, come on.

Summer.

Summer, you told me
to handle my business.

You told me to handle
my business, Summer.

He told me to handle my business!

Somebody call an ambulance.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Don't leave me.

Oh, God, please help me.

Oh, my God, please.

Daizy sounds good.

One more question
for the record, G.

Does hip-hop have heart?

You won't let this question go,
will you?

I guess not.

Hell no.

We're a bunch
of heartless bastards.
