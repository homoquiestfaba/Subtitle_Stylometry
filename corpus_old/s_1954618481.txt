Hi, I'm Amanda Tapping from
the television series "Sanctuary."

In May 2007,
the series first went online

in the form
of eight 15-minute webisodes.

What you're about to see

is the second hour of those
webisodes in their original form

for the first time on television.

Enjoy.

Madness. There's no other word for it.
And it will be your undoing.

You must understand, Gregory,
the board has been patient with you,

but their generosity has limits.

As does their imagination!

Can you not fathom the secrets
we are on the verge of unlocking?

By accepting your hysterical
and outlandish case studies as fact?

You presume too much,
Gregory.

I believe we are done here.

Try to see the larger
implications, Gregory.

I am, sir.

The question is, are you?

You're a talented doctor, Gregory.

It would be a tragedy
if you lost your license to practice.

Miss Magnus.

I'm sorry you had to hear that.

I don't understand.

Why are they always
so angry at you?

They're not angry, sweetheart.
They're afraid.

Of what?
Oh, of being wrong, mainly.

Just put it out of your mind.
How can you say that?

They mean to end your career.
Helen...

Let it go.
Please, father.

What have you done
to make them so afraid of you?

Tell me.

I can't.

I said, are you sure this is it?
Keep your voice down!

We're trying to remain undetected.

That does require
a modicum of silence.

Modicum. Right.

WILL: Why are we hiding?

We're on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

And it's a crypt, not the Pentagon.

A crypt potentially
containing an elixir

capable of prolonging life
for centuries.

Such secrets are rarely left
unguarded.

Yeah, but why can't we just...
Look.

Keepers of the dead. Best
to be avoided if at all possible.

Right.

Okay.

I got "I'm going in" and "go around,"
but what was that wiggly one you did?

"I'm cutting off your allowance."

Let's go.

Take the other side.
Draw them away if you can.

You're kidding, right?
Go quickly, before they...

HELEN: Ashley?

DRUITT'S VOICE: My daughter.

Get down!

I know this was not
on the brochure!

This is why we don't work with Ernest.
His intel is hopeless! Ashley!

Go to the crypt! Go!

Mom!

I'm going in!

Doctor!

This might be my first crypt,

but aren't they supposed
to hold dead people?

Yes, yes, I realize
he's left me five messages.

That's why I'm returning his call.

Okay, okay.

When do you expect him
back in the office?

No, no, no, don't page him.
I'll... I'll call him back then.

Okay, thank you.

Hey.
Hi.

So, that was some mission, huh?
Ghouls, crypt.

Standard fare.
Uh, new guy. Still not sleeping.

No such thing as standard fare.

Great.

So, I was just wondering, um,
how are you doing? Since...

Since I learned my dad
was a time-traveling nutjob?

I was going to say
"troubled soul, " but...

Peachy. Thanks for asking.

Hey, uh...

You know, that's some pretty serious
information to be carrying around.

If you ever want to just, you know,

sit down and talk
and kind of let it out, I'm here.

Here's some advice about me.
I'm not big on "sharing."

So just stick to helping the freaks.
That's why you're here.

Ciao.

See you.

Three not-so-dead women
found in coffins.

Just another day at the office.
All three are comatose.

Fortunately, brain functions
and vital organs seem to be intact.

So they're normal?
Near as I can tell.

The scans aren't detecting
any physical anomalies,

but they can only tell us so much.

I'm administering
a time-released stimulant.

It should bring them back
to consciousness slowly,

with as little physical
trauma as possible.

What about emotional trauma?

That's more your department,
I should think.

Until they awaken,

we have to rely on more
traditional forensic methods.

Now, this fellow.

Fond memories.

These creatures
detected our presence early

and possessed unnatural
speed and strength.

Definitely not normal.
Not as you would define it, no.

I was about to gather
some fluid samples.

Care to assist?

WILL: Uh, I'd love to, but...

...I'd better get back to my office

and get the whole head-shrinking
operation up and running.

As you wish.

For crying out loud! Henry!
Steve, get off.

You okay, Ash?
You need a mint. Henry!

I know, I know, I know, I know.
It didn't work.

Which is why we have dry runs.
I could have died.

From him?
Come on. He's a puppy dog.

May I?

Full charge...

Minimum level...

There you go.
A calibration issue.

These long-range acoustic devices
get a bit wonky

when you jostle them, so...

Henry, I do a lot of jostling
when I work.

So choose a different weapon. I got
a new case of tech nines in the truck.

They've still got that new gun smell
and everything.

That was minimum?

I want my usual gear
ready for Friday, including the LRADs.

Calibrated to handle jostling.

Okay, well, the regular stuff
is no problem,

but the sonics, you're dreaming.

Besides, these are only good
if you're going after...

No, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

You're not thinking
of trying to kill

what I think you're
thinking of trying to kill.

Just make it happen, Henry.

Ash, that is
a completely unsanctioned...

Friday.

I'm going to tell your mother!

Suck up.

No!

No, no, I'm not avoiding
the question, sir.

I just...

You know, I think I need
to some time to, um, travel,

and meet some new people,

and, you know, see things
that I haven't...

...seen before.

Uh, yes, sir. Yes.
So if you could just process...

Thank you. Thank you. And...

So much for the letter
of recommendation.

You're needed in the infirmary.
Okay, new rule.

Don't do that.

Hi.

It's nice to see you're finally awake.
I'm Dr. Zimmerman. Will.

Are you...? Are you hungry?
What's your name?

Can you understand
anything I'm saying?

Hey, it's okay. It's okay. You're okay.
You're in a safe place.

Okay, okay. Alright, you're okay.

You're in a safe place. Just relax.

I...

...am Danu.

So you can talk.

My sisters... Tatha and Caird...
are they?

They're fine. Your sisters are fine.
You just woke up first.

You're in a medical facility.

We brought you here
after we found you in a...

...dark place.

Do you have any idea
how you ended up there?

Creatures.
They came to our village.

They weren't human.

Yeah, sounds familiar.

They took us with them,
and then...

...I woke up here.

Your village.

Is there anyone there...
your friends or family...

that we could contact?

Let them know you're alright?
I'm sorry, I just...

I can't remember.

Well, it's okay.
You just take your time.

This place...
It's like...

...nothing I've ever seen before.

There's... There is light,
but I see no candles.

There's warmth,
but there's no fire, no sunlight.

Danu, before you and your sisters
were taken,

how much do you remember?

I'm not certain. I...

At last mass, we were mourning
the loss of our priest to the miasmas.

The miasmas?

It's a sickness that has cursed
many villages surrounding us

in recent months.

There is no cure.
So you remember the miasmas.

Anything else?

Why can't I remember?

Just give it time.

I understand you have
quite the weekend planned.

Thank you, Henry.

He called out of concern
for your well-being,

something you seem
determined to sacrifice.

You mean I'm going
to get myself killed.

God, why can't you talk
like a normal person?

Ashley, I realize there are things

that need to be discussed
between us...

Sure, Mom.

Let's bake treats and bond
and do each other's hair...

Right after I go kill a bunch
of ghouls for sport.

Those creatures are
on the contraband list for a reason.

There are specific rules
governing their capture.

Well, a lot of things changed
since good old dad showed up.

That changes nothing.

I had no reason...
When he had me prisoner...

Mom, I froze on that island.
Okay? I hesitated.

Do you realize how major
a problem that is?

For both of us.

And you think that by going off
on some insane hunt

you'll suddenly overcome
your fears?

Ashley...
Mom, if I can't do that...

...I'm not worth a damn
to anybody, am I?

Please don't do this.

HELEN: These creatures exhibit

a terrifying propensity
for violence.

Any future encounters with them

must be undertaken
with extreme caution.

Physiology appears human
in base form,

though significant anomalies
to the face and torso

indicate the possibility of mutation
at a base genetic level.

Ugh. Okay, you need to...

You need to put a sock on the door
or something before you do that.

He's breathtaking, isn't he?

Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
How are our guests doing?

Confused. At least the one
who's awake is.

She mentioned a disease that
was killing people in her village,

called the "miasmas,"

which translates from the Greek
meaning "poisoned air."

Plague, actually.
The bubonic plague, specifically.

However, the last reported
serious outbreak

was in Scotland in 800 A.D.

Meaning?
She's crazy.

Is that your professional opinion?

Look, I know there's a lot of things

that are outside the realm
of our knowledge, blah blah blah.

But logically,
if she were from 800 A.D.,

she wouldn't speak English
the way we do.

I'm guessing that linguistics
and grammar

have evolved somewhat
since then.

Some would say "devolved."
Whatever.

The point is that
we wouldn't understand her.

Which makes her a very sweet,
very delusional woman.

Possibly.

If you have a theory,
please share it with the class.

The liquid we found
the three of them in

bears similar chemical properties

to suspended animation formulae
used by southern voodoo cults.

The human body cannot survive
intact for 1,200 years.

I don't care what kind
of magic bath products you use.

And I agree.

So, these women are either
far more than they appear,

or, to use your incredibly
clever vernacular...

Crazy.

The question we should
be asking...

...is why the keepers
were so anxious to stop us

from getting into that crypt.

What is it about these women
that they don't want us to know?

HELEN: Is it true?
And how was your evening?

They cannot do this.
It's beyond unfair.

It's already done.
Ignorant bastards.

Language, Helen.

You brought the Royal College
out of the Dark Ages.

Sanitation reforms,
treatments for smallpox, cholera,

those were all your incentives.

You can't be surprised.

They've been trying to rescind
my membership for a decade now.

It only took this long
because they lack imagination.

What is it?

Like father, like daughter,
I suppose.

Helen, I'm so sorry.

I had the highest possible marks
in the entrance exam,

and yet they've rejected me again.

You already know more than
the doctors who wrote the exam.

I cannot legally
practice medicine anywhere

without a degree
from the London School.

There's not a hospital or clinic
in Europe that would hire me.

This is my third rejection.
I can't take the exam again.

Because you're a Magnus.
I do not accept this, Father!

I will not settle for a life
of mediocrity and subjugation!

I want more.

Teach me.

My private research is...

...unorthodox, Helen.

It is not to be entered into lightly.
Nor with anger.

You are the most talented medical
researcher I have ever known.

And yet you keep your most
important work hidden from the world,

from me.

If you truly believe
that I have potential, Father, please,

help me achieve it.

Once you enter this door, you are
on a path that cannot be reversed.

DANU: It's as though this is all
a dream, and when we wake up,

everything will be the same
as it was before.

Why is nothing familiar to us?

This building, these clothes...

...and these rooms
are all warm without fire.

The light is unchanging
with the day.

It's a lot to digest, Caird.

I see myself in the mirror,
and I recognize my face.

I know Tatha and Danu,
but the person I thought I was...

You're telling me there is no village.
No sickness.

The little I can remember is false.

How can we all not feel
completely lost?

Danu has told us that you insist
there were no magicks involved,

that what we suffer
is simply a malady.

It's more of an emotional shield.

We found you in a crypt
surrounded by monsters.

It's normal for the human psyche
to put itself in a safe mode.

We want to accept
your diagnosis, doctor,

and we are grateful
for all that you've done.

It's just...
You're still not buying it.

The clinical term
is schizoaffective disorder.

It's a delusional state stemming
from acute post-traumatic stress.

People have awoken from comas
thinking they were royalty,

that they were aliens
from another planet,

even people with super powers.

But we are all three suffering
from the same disorder.

How is that possible?

Delusional behavior
occurring virally in groups is rare,

but it's not undocumented,
particularly amongst siblings.

Look, let me put it this way.

If you really were 1,200 years old,

then there's no way
that I would understand

anything you're saying right now.

How do you explain that?

There is no logical or physical way
that your memories can be real.

And the sooner you accept that,

the sooner we can continue
to make progress.

Because the truth
will out eventually.

It always does.

Excellent timing.
I'm starved.

They raise my hackles.
In a good way?

You know there is no good way.

Progress?
Nothing concrete.

Base physiology
is essentially human.

DNA scans indicate significant
mutations to key chromosomes,

likely resulting in increased
adrenal production,

heightened strength and reflexes,
as well as this lovely appearance.

All in all, be glad you missed it.

I'm not.

You were recuperating.
We managed.

You were lucky.
And I'm fine now.

I'll be the judge of that.

Yes, doctor.

Now, what remains
to be determined

is whether our friend's genetic
mutation is accidental in nature

or by design.

You think someone made him?

I think there are a lot of unanswered
questions about these creatures,

including the significance of this.

From his right hand, index finger.

It is old.

Very old.
That's what I thought.

Which is why I'll be needing
a ride later tonight.

Where are we going?

To see if your hackles are right.

WILL: I want you to concentrate
on the sound of my voice.

I'm going to count backwards
from five, four, three, two, one.

Danu, can you hear me?

Yes.

I want you to go back
to the last thing you remember

before you woke up here.

The creatures.

They're too strong.

We can't escape.

Why are they doing this?

We've done nothing wrong!

They're making us drink something.

We can't move.

Darkness.

I want you to go back further.

Find a memory of something
that happened

before the creatures took you.

Moonlight.

It's cold.

I'm in a field.

I can sense the dead.

Their souls extinguished.

Only we remain.

They're not nightmares.

DANU: That field...
All the dead...

We were actually there that night.

It's more than that.

We were the reason.

Doctor, your message was very
intriguing. You never disappoint.

I see you've cleaned up
since I was here last.

I know, it's so austere
and uninviting. I deplore it.

But when one's life is centered
around a cruel irony,

one has to make
a few concessions.

This way.

After you.
Thank you.

Paintings and moisture
are mortal enemies.

Sadly, I need both to survive.

Now, let me take a look
at your precious little bauble

and we can get started.

Oh, this is interesting.
Wherever did you find it?

Scotland. On a mutated human
guarding an ancient crypt.

Scotland, you say. Curiouser.
Ring any bells?

Plenty of them.

It's just a question
of deciding which ones to listen to.

The design is at least
a thousand years old,

predating the Norman Conquest,
I'd wager.

I know I've definitely seen
something like it before. Yes.

Ah!

Ringing bells, ringing bells.

Ding dong.

And voila.

Fifth century tapestry reproduction.

Now, what are they
being offered here?

Blood of Christ?

Oh, please.
Nothing so cliché.

No, this design was the symbol
of the Cabalis Nocturnum,

a quaint little subsect
of Romano-British knights

from the early Middle Ages.

Charged with protecting the world
from dark influences, I believe.

These warriors likely drank
from the chalice

as a gesture of loyalty
and faith to their cause.

Now, who is the man
offering it to them? A priest?

Bigger.

Think the most powerful man
in Britain at the time.

Hint: not King Arthur.

Merlin.

These knights were probably
rejects from Arthur's court.

Desperate to prove
themselves worthy,

they accepted a hideous task,
fighting the dark forces unleashed

by Merlin's nemesis, Morgan le Fay.

Evil sorceress,
avowed enemy of Arthur.

All-around mean-spirited bitch.

And who are they?

Those would be the Morrigan.

Emissaries created by Morgan

to wreak havoc
against Arthur's armies.

The very embodiment
of her hellish powers.

Legend has it their very presence
on a battlefield

would steal the souls
of Arthur's soldiers.

They've popped up in literature
throughout the ages,

most notably as the trio
of hags in Macbeth.

You know, boil boil,
toil, and all that.

So the Morrigan were witches.

Oh, no, love.
They were the witches.

Easy, Steve. Easy.

Ladies...

I'm pretty sure we have rules
about... floating and stuff.

Whoa, whoa!

What say you just come down
and we talk about this?

Oh, crap.

That's quite enough of that.

I had everything under control.

WILL: Witches, huh?

Been a while since we had
to clean up from some of those.

Hey, you must be the new guy.
Henry Foss.

Weapons, tech support, phone guy,
you name it, I either build it or fix it.

Hopefully not in that order.
Will Zimmerman.

Yes, I've heard about you.

Well, not much, actually,
but I'm sure you're up for the task.

More than the last guy, anyway.

Look at this. You see that?

I'm telling you, women plus
technology equals mess.

Hey, don't take this the wrong way,
but are you...? You know?

I'm just kidding. I'm a normal boring
Homo sapiens, just like yourself.

My great great grandfather was
Magnus' original weaponsmith

back in London.

It's all about nepotism, dude.

Henry, is my lab operational?
Not yet.

Then I suggest you stop talking
and go and fix it.

FYI: around here, humans
are second class citizens.

Go.

Especially men.

Right. Your turn.

Based on the supernatural
forces at work here,

I'd say you're lucky to be alive.

Yeah, I got nailed by three witches.

It'll make a great story
at my next medical conference.

Is your bravado
meant to be charming?

Isn't it?

I find no permanent damage
as a result of your injuries.

As I said, lucky.

So what did they do?

From what I can gather,

our guests unleashed powerful
psychic energy on a massive scale.

Had it been left unchecked, the toll
would have been quite substantial.

Psychic energy,
as in they can read minds?

I'm guessing that's how
Danu was able

to quickly learn our vernacular
of English,

and instantly pass that knowledge
on to her siblings.

Okay, I saw them
floating in the air,

I watched them destroy the lab
with their minds, I guess.

But as for them being
the actual Morrigan, there's no way.

The markings on the ring.
The memories of ancient battles.

I'm entertaining the possibility.

Or they could just be three
scared, lost, delusional women,

albeit with some freaky powers.

Not famous witches
from 1,200 years ago.

But that's not what
you want to hear, is it?

I beg your pardon?

We looked in that crypt for...
Elixirs.

Right. Ones that could help you
with your condition.

And instead, we found
three people in coffins,

three people who are now claiming

to be even older than you
by a long shot.

I see.

So I'm imposing my personal
agenda on the situation,

hoping that these three women
can somehow help me help me

find a cure for my longevity.

It's understandable.

If they were in fact 1,200 years old,
they may hold the key to helping you...

You can't possibly understand.

Life without end is not a gift.
It's a curse.

It means loneliness. Isolation.
It means being less human.

Now, if you can somehow prove
that these three women

are nothing more than misunderstood
abnormals, believe me,

I will be the first
to applaud your efforts.

But if they are
indeed who I suspect,

then you, more than anyone,
are in mortal danger.

Because they hate men.

The Morrigan were created
for one purpose only.

That's why you and my manservant
were so affected.

Well, then we'd better
hope that I'm right.

Hey.

You scared the crap outta me.

Because of my unbearable
hotness?

God, you're a mess.
Here, let me help you.

So how's the shopping list going?
Having the time of my life.

Did I miss anything?
Yeah, witches.

Cool.

You might want your mom
to take a look at that.

Later.

Hey, listen, I know you're all
about keeping up your mojo

and not sharing things,
but I promise you

you're going to be in a lot less pain
both physically and emotionally

if you'd just talk
about what you're going through.

That's all I'm saying.

Okay?

You ever look at a ghoul,
a really nasty one,

right in the eye
before you send it packing?

You see one of two things.

You see fear. It knows it's dead meat,
and that's kinda sad.

But others...
the really bad ones...

they never stop wanting
to take you down,

right up until the moment
you pull the trigger.

And those kills,
they're the sweetest.

And sometimes, when I nail
something that mean and terrible,

when I watch it die, I feel...

Well, it's hard to explain.

But trust me.

It's a thousand times more cathartic
than lying on a couch,

crying about how your life sucks...

...doctor.

I can only say how sorry I am
that you were the ones who found us.

We should never
have been disturbed.

Why are you sorry?

You were kind to us.

Never passed judgment
on our actions.

You mean your memories
of killing all those men?

I hate to tell you this,
but memory is probably

the most untrustworthy thing
our minds have to offer.

You shouldn't do this.

Do you want me to believe
that you're evil witches

from the Middle Ages?

Danu, before your so-called
memories returned,

you and your sisters
were kind, reasonable people.

You said "please" and "thank you."

So forgive me
if I fail to believe that...

I remember who I am, who we are.
What we've done.

You just refuse to accept it.

Battles were lost and won
because of our presence.

We were the bringers of pestilence
that destroyed men's souls.

My power when I act alone
is but a tiny shard

compared to when
we three are as one.

A thousand men marched
on Badon Hill that morning.

All were dead before nightfall,

all without the touch
of neither sword nor spear.

And now that we are free,
more will die.

That is our purpose.

When shall we meet again?

In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When the hurly-burly's done.

When the battle is lost and won.

I told you.

I remember who I am now.

So that's what the couch is for.

Okay, you win.

They're witches from the Middle Ages.
What do we do with them?

Keep them secure.
Study them.

Understand their power,
and help them if we can.

Look, I realize I don't have a lot
of experience dealing with witches,

but I'm not sure I have the time
or the talent to turn them

into productive
members of society.

Yes, well, our work
does have its limitations.

You know what bugs me is that
before I jogged their memories,

they seemed...

...normal.

Well-adjusted.

Not homicidal life-sucking
sorceresses

who killed a thousand men
at some place called Badon Hill.

Badon Hill?

Yeah, what about it?

Wexford mentioned it as the site
of the final battle

that handed Arthur
control of Britain.

So the thousand men...

Would have been Saxons,
not Britons.

Wait, wait, wait,
you told me the Morrigan

were created to destroy Arthur,
not help him defeat his enemies.

What if they had no choice?

HELEN: Of course. It makes sense.
She would never have done that.

WILL:
Who wouldn't have done what?

HELEN: What do we know
about Morgan le Fay?

Uh...

She was an evil sorceress
who was Arthur's enemy.

Now, ask yourself,
who would have written that?

Men?
Men. Exactly.

This is revisionist history.

What if the Morrigan
were not created to wreak havoc,

but rather to restore
balance to the world?

It follows what other revisionist
scholars have already uncovered

through ancient history.

Patriarchal monarchies that were
actually run by women, for example.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, before you get
all Da Vinci Code on me,

how do you know that Morgan le Fay
wasn't just simply evil?

I don't.

But I do know
that throughout history,

feminine energy never
seeks to try to dominate,

but rather tries to restore harmony
to the world, to make it whole.

Arthur wanted to control
all of Britain.

What if Morgan was simply trying
to stop his rush to power?

Here it is.

These are Arthur's battles
in his campaign to rule Britain.

Looks like he lost
more than half of them.

How does a guy become
king of England

with this kind of win/loss record?

Henry...

That's better.

Oh. Please!
I'm just an employee.

Prior to Badon Hill, Arthur's armies
suffered many defeats,

but with very few casualties.

Most of his men simply lost the will
to fight and abandoned their posts.

But then something changed.
At Badon Hill.

A massive defeat was visited
upon the Saxons by Arthur's forces.

Now, legend says that most died,
but without any marks on them.

The witches changed sides?

My guess is that Merlin somehow
brainwashed these women.

He recognized them
as Morgan's greatest weapon

and tried to find a way
to control them.

Okay.

So Morgan le Fay
creates witches to do good.

Then Merlin captures them and uses
them to hand Britain to Arthur?

And then locks them away,

keeping them alive
in case they're needed in the future.

And the ghouls...

They're an incorruptible army
created by Merlin

to ensure that the Morrigan
would never be free again.

Well, no offense to Merlin,
but he didn't do a very good job.

I mean, if we can...

Move!

I should have predicted this.

Merlin's army is reclaiming
their prize.

Yeah, would have been nice
to have seen that coming.

Many have tried.

None have lived.

Damn!

Why the monologuing,
if you're so bad?

VAMPIRE:
Didn't your mother warn you?

About me?

I'm way beyond bad!

Magnus!

Really?

When you keep monsters
in your house...

We need to lock down
the entire facility.

Yeah, good idea.

HELEN: Oh, for God's sake.
WILL: What now?

Henry?

HELEN: Henry, respond.

Uh, problems.

I know. We're being overrun.

I need the security protocols
for the entire facility

operational immediately.

HENRY: Witches... being... bad.

Now, I believe you were about
to let us go.

Go help Henry in the lab.

Make sure the Morrigan
do not escape.

Or anyone else, for that matter.

Wait. What about you?

I don't like uninvited guests
in my house.

How is that an answer?
Go.

Where the hell have you been?
We need weapons.

We need Ashley.

Seriously.
A lawyer vampire.

The cliché factor
doesn't offend you?

Not if you're the first.

Hadn't you noticed?

I'm not like all the other guys
you date.

These pants were new.

Send me the bill.

Good career move, Will.

Real good.

Crap!

This is so unfair.

The more you resist,
the more you will feel pain.

Let us go.
I don't work for you.

Then you'll die.

Danu! Don't do this.

We will not be prisoners again.
To you or anyone.

That's not what's going on here.

We can help you.

You can't possibly
promise us freedom.

We are who we are.
You are not evil!

WILL: At least, you weren't
in the beginning.

TATHA: We were created
to destroy men.

No, you were created to stop a war.
But Merlin changed you.

He made you forget
who you really are.

Believe me, if he could transform
a monk or knight into something

out of a late night horror movie,

he can make you think
you're something your not.

Since when do the bringers of death
have a conscience?

CAIRD: That was before.

No, no, before is
who you really are.

WILL: Look, please...

Believe me.

What the?

Henry, Henry!
You've got to unlock it!

Henry, unlock it, now!

Henry, status!

HENRY: Uh, the cells are secured,
but the upper levels and the lab

are still vulnerable.

And the new guy wants
to let the witches out.

I just wanted to talk to them.

Magnus, I was getting
through to them.

Oh, please,
they were playing you.

Are you even qualified
to talk about this?

Be quiet and listen.
We are about to be overrun.

Forget about the rest of the facility.
Protect the lab at all costs.

And find Ashley!

Oh, okay, how do I do that?

Magnus?

Alright, how do you usually
contact Ashley?

Is there some kind of Bat Signal
or something?

Of course not. She usually just...
ASHLEY: Will, Henry!

Yes!
ASHLEY: I'm in the building.

Okay, great, so you're aware

that we're up to our necks
in crypt people, right?

Working on it.

No!

Ashley?

Magnus?

Hello?

Okay, so it's just the two of us?

Yeah.

We're so screwed.
