Do you copy?

[Police Officer]Are you kidding?

[Police Officer] Well

[Police Officer] Yo, unit
two, check it out.

I copy your complaint.

Now if you get a vagrant
wandering onto our

show, can you probably
inform him that this is

police frequency.


I don't know who you are boy...

[Police Officer]Bugsy,
did you hear that?

He called you boy.

[Police Officer] I heard
him, Mike, thank you.

Thank you very much.

[Police Officer]Who
the hell are you?

I want your call letters now!

This is some official
police radio frequency, now

you got two seconds to get off.

girl I ever knew

couldn't get me off that fast.

[Police Officer]
Look, you're interfering,

with an arrest you
mister, all right?

This is a felony, now terminate
your transmission now!

[Police Officer] I'm sure
that really scared him.

[Police Officer]I believe it did.

[Police Officer] Look, you're
violating the law.

Mr. Marlboro Man, last chance.

Get off the frequency!


and I'd love to stay and chat.

I got a black male with bandana

holdin' an automatic.

Need backup, I'm in pursuit!

Get off punk!

Punk, punk, punk, punk. (Echoing)

(grocery basket clanging)

(trash rattling)

(breathing heavy)

Wait, wait, so anyway
he pulls this up

and says, "Shrimp."

Just like this he goes...

[Police Dispatcher]Unit
eight, your

suspect is entering
the parking lot.

Hey, hey, hey...

(menacing music)


Give it up, give it up!

Oh, this guy's gonna
fuckin' bust him.

What's in his hand?

Ahh! Gimme the
keys mother fucker!

I'm not gonna keep talkin' it,

get your hands off of 'em.

You!

I'm gonna drop you!

(gun blasts)

(tires squealing)

(gun blasts)

(explosive boom)

Whoa!

No way!

(explosive boom)

Well... (mumbling)

(fire crackling)

Can't believe it!

Excuse me, Marlboro
Man, nice job.

Who the hell are you guys?

We're vice.

Yeah, Video Vice.

(fire crackling)

Video Vice?

Well for a minute there I thought

you were real cops.

Hey, do you know how
you tell a real cop?

A real cop doesn't blow his cover.

(sirens wailing)

What the hell you looking at?

Not much.

You'd look a lot
abetter with a smile

on your face and your hair down.

Kids.

(helicopter blades spinning)

(sirens wailing)

(water hissing)

(sirens wailing)

Huh, hundred dollar
bill, nice touch.

What you see and what you hear

in this room is confidential,

strictly not for public release.

This is what I wanna
talk to you about.

This is what we're up
against, a serial killer.

(gun blast)

We have no motive, only method.

We have no suspects, only
a few suspicions.

And they are Chief?

The killer is
probably a prostitute.

She has sex with her victim
then she kills them.

As to motive, it could be
any number of reasons.

The psych department has
come up with several.

So we have an unhappy hooker.

Oh, and she wears a red wig.

It's stone-cold dead after that.

Okay, so what you're saying is...

What I'm saying is that your
team has done a good job.

What you need is some help
now, so we're gonna get you that.

Look, wait, we don't
need any help, we're fine.

Heather, Heather, send in
Joe if you would please.

Best man in homicide.(saloon
piano jingle)

Oh, Lord, this guy?

God almighty.

Oh my God, oh Lord, TJ Hooker.

You know each other?


I don't know what
game you're playing,

but you better be able to
work with one another.

Well I don't wanna
work with these guys,

they're a bunch of pups.

Hey Joe, we didn't ask for you.

Chief, we can do this
on our own, really.

second that, Chief.

He doesn't exactly...

Hey, hey, hey, hey why don't
you watch your language man.

Oh, we homeboys now?

I don't like your language.

I don't like your
clothes, so now we're even.

That's clever.

What are you looking at?

You, I'm staring at you.

A woman is the worst mistake

in the history o flaw enforcement.

Well look at that, he's not
only rude, he's a caveman.

Well even a caveman knows a woman

can't do a man's job.

No, come on.

Yeah right.

Come on.


Ouch!

What does that prove?

Well that's my point, honey,
that's my point.

Well, I'm glad we're all friends.


Cute little stunt you
pulled in there partner.

Well, partner, you gotta
lay down the ground rules,

let 'em know who's in charge.

They like that.

Maybe you shouldn't
be quite so hard.

Well, maybe.

It's one thing to videotape
hookers, it's another

thing to track down
killers, you know that.

These young nimrods, they
hesitate one second

and the city of Vegas
doesn't have to worry about

paying my pension.

They're fully aware, Joe.

I could be wrong, I
could be wrong.

Look at me, 20 years
in-grade, and you,

you partner up with
me for a few years,

and you just climb on
up that latter Chief.

They don't always promote
the best cops, Joe,

they promote the
best administrators.

It's a dubious distinction at best.

Dubious?


Yeah.

We had our days, didn't we?

Oh God yeah, yeah.

Life goes on though.

Yeah it does.

Yes sir, Chief.

(suspenseful music)

(telephone ringing)

(toilet flushing)

(telephone ringing)

Hello, yeah okay, okay,
thanks a lot.

That's the front
desk, she's on her way.

This is it.

Joe, I need you to adjust
the camera on your buckle.

On your buckle, that's
it, that's it.

That's good.

Just talked to the bell
captain, ho is on the way.

All right, woow!

Damn girl, what were you
doing in that bathroom?

(door knocks)

Just a second.

(menacing jingle)

(door knocks)

All right, well wait a minute.

What am I doin'?

(door knocks)

Coming.

Hi.

Hi sweetie.

Come on in.

You're kinda young,
how old are you?

How old do you want me to be?

Old enough, I guess.

Can I use your bathroom?

Sure, it's back there.

Get ready Joe.


I said, we're gonna have
a real good time baby.

Well, you get what
you pay for sweetie.

So, what'll it be,
around the world?

Normal.

A traditionalist, I'm an
old fashioned girl myself.

That'll be a $100 bucks.

Is that negotiable?

No, but it is in advance.


I think that's it, shall we go?

No, no, no.- No, no, no.

Let him cook for a little while.

Yeah, yeah.



Boy she must of been out of lotion.



He looks a little
angry, doesn't he?


Fun's over, come on,
come on, let's go.

Okay.

Oh man.

Vegas Vice, you are under
arrest for prostitution.

Where in the hell you guys been?

I can't take another bust.

Joe, it's just a...

What, what do you have to say?

I mean, we figured
you have a little time

to skeet the ball.

Oh yeah?

Excuse me?

No, excuse me.

Take another bust...

I don't give a rat's ass...

(glass smashing)

Ugh!

Bitch jumped out the window.

Ahh! (Grunt)

Bitch jumped our the window!

Ugh!

(tires squealing)

(engine revving)

(electric guitar jingle)

(tires squealing)

(car horns blasting)

(heavy breathing)


(saloon piano melody)

That is not the most
professional display

of police work I have ever seen.

Actually Chief, I think
the sound and the camera

work is like, you know
with, and the camera is like...

(fist smacking)

Yeah, it was actually... It
was real... Oh...

Yeah, it looked nice.

You had a few problems.

Oh, we had a few
problems all right,

right here with these girl scouts.

Another feminine
reference, how nice.

All we did was let
Joe sit in there

and cook a little too
long with the suspect.

It's no big deal, Joe.

You know, it's just like an
initiation into the club.


Damn it was just a joke.

It was just a joke, damn.

You think putting two
people in the hospital,

costing the city thousands
of dollars worth of property

damage is funny?

Well it ain't funny, it
ain't a joke.

Look at me punk, I'm
talkin' to you.

I ain't laughin'.

There's nobody laughing here.

You know what?

We don't need a babysitter, okay,
and you're too loud.

Would you like some
bread to go with all that

whine you...

Chief, maybe somebody
with a sense of humor

might be...

Look, this is like ridiculous!

There's no reason
why we can't do...

Hey, hey, confine your jokes
to your men on your own time.

joke.- Take a joke.

It's hot in here, turn
on the air conditioning.

Chief, your appointment's here.

Oh, oh.

Oh, and Mike, your
girlfriend called,

test results were negative.

Could you please do me a favor,

can you just put this
stuff in my mailbox?

Is that all right?

I'm not your personal secretary.

And, oh, the surf
shop called from LA,

your board is ready.

Thank you.

What is Sex Wax anyway?

It's something that you're
never gonna know about, please

just run away, please.

(door creaking shut)

Come on Bardog,
right for the top.

Hey, Jake, watch
out, Joe's getting serious.

He's putting on the side boards.

It's illegal inmost
states, you know?

on the side boards.


Woo!

Ahh, damn freakin' rookies!

Hey, give it up will ya?

Are you still pissed off
about that vice thing?

Hey the chief likes the
numbers, pandering and prostitution

are both down.

And a vice for your advice...

Vice-ke-teers!

My God, what the
hell you know about

the streets anyway, huh?

You're still pencils and
pushing the buttons...

What do I know about the streets?

Hey, if you don't...

On the computer...

You and I and Barney
invented the streets.

Jake.


You remember my rookie year?


Hey, what is it, something
I don't know about?


Come on, what is it?

Me and Joe, me and Joe are
out on the streets, right?

Now, I'd been on the
job, what, about a week,

and he's been on about a
year, so that makes him

the veteran and makes
me the rookie.

Which means I gotta do
everything he says,

so we bust this hustler
down on the strip.

So he tells me, he tells
me I gotta pat her down

'cause she might be packing a rod.


Yeah, well that's something
we used to have to do.


So I'm like kinda
trying to, you know...

Trying to feel this poor girl up.


will ya, what happened?

All right, all right, all
right, so I get my hands

around her front, I'm kinda
like hesitating, and he's

going, "Come on, come on, come
on, you gotta do it",

"you gotta do it."


So I reached down in front,

and she's packing a rod all right.

I'm shaking hands with the
biggest salami on the strip.


That son of a bitch has got
me feeling up a transvestite.



And then, and then she
says, "You can bust me anytime."


Let's get the hell
out of here man.

Hey, gimme the keys.

No, I ain't giving you the keys.

Gimme the keys.

You got the keys.

No, no, no, you got the keys.

Here, here, here's the keys.

Here, Bardog's got the keys!

Come on, let's go. (Laughing)

Come on, big guy.

Oops. (Laughing)

(suspenseful music)

(coins jingling)

(upbeat music)

I'd like to propose a
toast to a big bust.

Yes.

Oh, I'm not drinking
to that bastard, uh-huh.

Oh, no, no, no, not
that bust, I'm talking

about the bust over there in black.

Ho! Drink 'em up!

You dick!

Vice-ke-Teers!

Bugs! Who-ah!

Love you Joe.

Hey man, how'd ya
get a name like Bugs?

Barney, Barney, I never heard a
president named Bugs before.

You think that's racist, don't you?

It's not racist, it's a
joke, and you guys...

Barney, they know about jokes.

You know about jokes, don't you?

But I love you guys, I do, no I do.

I love you.

I love the
vice-ke-teers, vice-ke-teers,

vice-ke-teers.

We love you too Joe.

I especially love you.

I mean that.

Joe, Joe, Joe.

Joe.

Mike, Mike, Mike.

Why don't you go get
yourself a cup of coffee?

Joe, Joe, Joe

why don't you go get
yourself a cup of coffee?

It ain't gotta be
like that brother,

No, you ain't got to do all that.

We don't need to fight, we're
gonna go to another place.



out of here man, come on.

Okay, she loves you too
Joe, it's cool brother.

It's cool.

Okay, I'll let you go now.

Barney we're going to go to
a place a little more mature.


Love you bro.

Love you too bro.

Washington baby!

I love you too Joe.


(rushing water)

(suspenseful music)

have your bad habits Fred.


I'm still having
problems with my wife.

I think we can

take care of a few
of those worries.


(suspenseful music)

(skin slapping)

(gun fire)

(horn honking)

(door knocks)

Housekeeping!

(speaks in foreign language)


(country music heard
from a distance)

It's just like the
others Joe, gunshot wound

consistent with the gun.

Same bullet markings?

Mm-Hmm. Size and depth of
the wound matches the others.

Bullet right between
Alexander Hamilton's eyes.

Anything further
on the drug test?

Ah, I did see something.

Let me see.

Well toxicology shows
indications of stress

to the heart muscle, which
could indicate cocaine use.

Cocaine?

And alcohol, all of
the victims had higher

than normal blood levels.

Joe, you want some more coffee?

Yeah, leave the whole
pot right there bro.

Thanks bro.

Another one of these please.

You gotta drink that
this early in the morning?

I'm on my way to look at a body

that's been in a
river for two weeks.

I need encouragement.

Okay, I see. (Chuckles)

All right, so what you're saying is

that she meets the victim at a bar.

They get high
together, they get laid,

and the John gets whacked?

That's about it.

Do you think possibly
that this could be

some kind of homosexual crime?

Do you think our
murderer could be a man?

Well, there have
been similar cases,

but there's nothing
here in these reports

to indicate any anal penetration.

I did see something, there's
definitely

been a woman's secretion on
each of the victim' organs.

Now there's a chance we
could run a DNA test

and try and link your
suspect to the murders,

but it's a real long-shot.

The samples we got are
very contaminated.

So what you're
basically saying is

that our lady friend here
straddles the victims,

nothing kinky, just
good ol' fashioned sex,

and that's all there is to it?

There's nothing to the contrary.

Well I don't get it then.

I mean, there's no
evidence of robbery.

Our hooker does her
job, she gets paid.

She takes the $100the
John gives her,

uses it as target practice.

All we have are a couple of
red hairs connected to a wig.

It doesn't make any sense.

Nothing makes sense.

Haven't you ever watched the
freaks on Oprah and Donahue?

Yeah, yeah.

They're all suspects, right?

You got it.

I'll let you know if we get lucky.

Thanks Tom.

Oh Tom, whatever happened to
that Pussycat Lounge case?

That case was solved.

These guys you're
working with are good.

(slow piano melody)

Yeah.


Okay, all right, all
right, how many cops

does it take to screw
in a light bulb?

Come on with it.

It takes two, okay, you
got one to screw

in the light bulb, and
you got the other

one to hold the donuts. (Laughing)


Oh, good, I got one, wait.

What do you do with an
elephant that has three balls?


(We give up.- [Bugs) We give Up.

You walk 'em and
pitch to the rhino.


Oh God, that sucked.

Oh, come on! (Laughing)

I'll pitch to the rhino.

That's one of the
four home-run balls

that Mays hit in Milwaukee
back in '61 or '62.

It means a lot to me, and
I want you to have it.

(mellow guitar jingle)

I can't take this Joe.

You take it, take it.

You serious?


Cool, thanks.

Look guys, I was way
out of line last night.

Are you saying you're sorry?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

(crinkling plastic)

Gee, nothing for me?

Is this a black thing Joe?


Number four Bugsy, I'm
gonna need your brain.

Now, what we got here?

Well, we got four dead Johns.

We can all count Mike.

Any supplemental Joe?

Well, she pulled this
guy out of a hotel bar.

The bartender gave us a
little bit better description

of her, but he couldn't
ID her from our book.

'em all in hotel bars?

That's right.

Tell me we're going about
this thing the wrong way.

(phone ringing)

Yeah, vice.

It's yours Joe.

Let me see that.

Owens.

Yeah, I said, yeah.

I got a dinner date.

Scary thought.

Very scary.


(suspenseful music)

(door sliding shut)

(soft piano music)

Hey Sally, cup of
coffee black, honey.

Thanks sweetheart.

Hey what do ya got there champ?

I got my new ball man.


Check it out.

It looks like the
ball Willie Mays hit

for his fourth home run
against the Braves,

what, '61-'62?

Wait a second, wait a
second, you've seen this before?

See it?

I got one at home man, everybody
in homicide has one.

Oh, okay...
Get out of here.

See no, wait a second, you
know, I told you that.

You know something, Joe said...

Yeah, but he doesn't
even own a mitt,

never played a ballgame
in his life, right?

Hey, let me tell you something
about Joe man, all right?


Joe's idle was Willie Mays.

Joe knew more about Mays than
Mays knew about himself.

And when Joe went up to spring
training with the Giants

when he was a rookie, he
got to play against Mays

in the spring training game.

What?

Yeah, and he fanned
Mays four times that day.

Anyway, he gets Mays
to a three-two count,

and I mean he just rears
back with everything he has,

and he grooves that ball
right down the middle.

He struck him out?

No, man, Mays hit the
ball out of the ballpark.

I mean, that ball... That's
flying still.

They're still looking
for that ball.

You can put a stewardess on
that ball he hit it so far.

Yeah, and you know what
though, the neat thing was,

is when Mays was rounding
the back, he stops

at third, he looks Joe
right in the eyes,

tips his cap as if
to say, thanks kid.

I know you could have fanned me.

So what, I mean, later on,
what happened with Joe?

Well, Joe had a temper.

Hello.- Hello.

Yeah dude's got a temper.

Hey, you know what, Joe's a
good man, and he's a good cop.

Welcome to the Big Leagues kid.

Arizona Charlies, best
place in town.

I'm the designated drinker tonight.

So you still the Ram man?

I am the number one fan.

You have my condolences.

They never should of
gotten rid of Dickerson.

Oh, like it would've
made a difference.

So you stayin' clean?

[Cab Driver] Sure man.


I got the friend, this
girl, and she's workin'

the streets.

She used to work for an
agency, one of those

part-time places.

You know, the kind you call
when you want a secretary.

What's the name of the agency?

Bon Temp.

Anyway, you call them, and
they send you a hooker.

It's like for high-rollers only.

It's a sleezy little
joint, and the broads

make a lot of money.

They're gorgeous too, man.

The only thing is, you
work for them,

they catch you using
drugs, forget it.

You're right back
out on the street.

That's what happened
to your friend?

Yeah.

Then she was telling me
about these killings...

What killings?

You know, the guys that
are getting bumped off

by the prostitutes.

Hey man, we're not stupid
out here, you know?

Go on.

All these guys were
going to the same agency

for their kicks.

Johnny, you holding
something from me?

The thing about it is, they
keep records on everything.

Good.

(mellow jingle)

Come on you guys, I've
got an early day tomorrow.

I have to be back
here in six hours.

Okay, Eleanor,
I'll tell you what,

give me just five minutes.

Yes.

What's a matter, no whores
on the street tonight?


a little dramatic.

You know, he should
have showed by now.

He'll show.

Whether we like it
or not, he'll show.

You know something Bugs, I
don't get the man.

He's a career cop, Mike.

Well come on man, we're
both career cops too,

I mean, that's a
little scary isn't it?

Maybe he's a little
rough around the edges,

but he's not that bad.

Yeah. (Hands slapping)

What's up guys?

Hey, Joe, what's up?

We got a hooker and gaming
operation underground,

and they keep some very
interesting records,

and we gotta move fast.

So how fast we talkin'?

Well we don't have time
for proper channels,

we gotta move right now.

Piece a cake, we stake
it out and we'll bust her.

Let's do it.

I'm telling you right now

that Andrea's not gonna dig this.

Let's go.

(suspenseful music)

(muffled speaking
from police radio)

Don't you think we should
have told Bronski about this?

Yeah.

Bugsy, you in place over there?

Copy.

You got that back door covered?

Covered.

five then you execute.

You got it.

(suspenseful music)

(muffled speaking
from police radio)

Showtime.

Now, y'all don't
shoot 'til you see

the whites of their thighs now.


(feet clomping)

Hey, how's it goin'?

Greetings from Vegas Vice.

(suspenseful music)

Hold it, police!

I'm a cop!

(tires squealing)

(door slamming)

(tires squealing)

(horn honking)

Pay dirt.

What do you got there?

Employees and clients.

Good!

(suspenseful music)

I'm heading for Red Rock!

Back up!

Come on, come on!

(crackling fire)

(soft piano music)

(door slamming)

That was stupid thing to do.

You're not authorized
to issue an order

platoon backup.

You're not authorized to coordinate

a civilian business bust.

This has to be authorized
by me, you know that.

Just trying to save time Dan.

Well don't cut corners, Joe.

No end runs.

How's Robinson?

He's doin' fine.

They kept him in the
hospital overnight

for routine observation.

Damn insurance people.

You can't cough
sideways in this job

without having to spend a
night in the hospital.

You come up with anything?

We have the records, and
we spent all night

going through them, but
haven't found anything

to tie into our case yet.

Can I get my ball back?

Next time, I wanna be informed.

Ahh.

Good pitch.

(papers crinkling)

Three more Togo, two more to go.

Two more?

This is it?

Ho!

Hey Bugs.- Hey Bugs.

Welcome back.

Bugsy!

Uh, I feel fine, I
can't say too much for

that hospital food though.

Slept like a baby.

You guys look like zombies.

Bullshit.

Did you have a chance
to check out that car?

Yeah, apparently the
scumbag was just the driver.

He would drive the cash
from here to Los Angeles.

He was just there to pickup
the weekly proceeds.

They found over$100,000 in cash.

One folder left.

Oh, by the way, they
broke the LA affiliate

on that Pleasure Palace thing.

That's great.

Well, look, let's get this
thing sorted out over here,

turn it over to the feds.

Ask LA to fax us whatever documents

or photos that they have.

Already done.

Remind me to put a gold
star on your time card.

Why don't you just give me
Willie Mays fourth homer?


Hello.

What do you got there?

Here.

We got one.

(suspenseful music)

And that's all we've got.

Look, I can't make anymore
sense out of this stuff

tonight, so, can we pack it in?

Well, I'll tell you
what, why don't we

wrap this up.

It's midnight now, we'll
meet back here at 8 am.

Okay, look, my car's in
the shop, I need a ride.

I'll take you.

Thank you.

Joe, I'm gonna stay
and put all this stuff

on the database.

I slept enough at the hospital.

Yeah, good.

What the hell's wrong
with you guys?

It's good to have you back, Bugs.


No fake.

Do you want me to stay
and give you a hand?

No, you go ahead, you
look a little tired.

Get some sleep.

(deep breath)

Anyway, that's how the
whole gang got started.

So now I know why the guys

didn't wanna bring you out here.

You live out in Iowa. (Chuckles)

Oh, I'm sorry.

They told me you had
quite a baseball career?

Yeah, what'd you hear
about my baseball career?


That you were really good.

Evidently not good enough.

I had the ability, I just
couldn't play the mental game,

the pressure.

When it came down to the big pitch,

I just couldn't get it across.


Ehh, full of crap.

Willie Mays' story right?


Yeah, they think I served
up the last pitch to Mays

so he could hit it.

They think I didn't wanna
embarrass my hero.

They're wrong.

Nobody have ever struck
out Mays before.

I wanted this more than
anything else in my life.

So I had an opportunity, but
I blew it.

Couldn't make the big pitch.

Hmm, well that's my
story, what's yours?

I was married once.

You seem like the type
that would stay married.

I would've liked it.

He was a lot older than me...

a Vietnam veteran.

It just got harder and
harder for him to adjust.

He couldn't get in sync
with the real world,

you know, he'd get
a job and lose it.

Then he got into a syndrome, he
started abusing drugs...

abusing me.


Yeah.

He hurt himself more
than he hurt me.

He killed himself.

(soft piano music)

Now that I made you drive
50 miles out here,

do you want to come up for
a drink or something?

Yeah, I'd love to.

(papers shuffling)

(keys tapping)


Anyway, her feet were
clean up in the air

behind the counter
at the donut shop.



Excuse me.

Pardon me.


I'm really having fun.

I'm glad you came up.

Me too.

I better get back, I
gotta drive all the way

back to Vegas.

Yeah, you better go.

I better go.

It's a long drive.

It was a very, very long drive

from my home to Vegas. (Chuckles)

Get out.


Kick me out.

Okay.

(romantic piano music)

I never kissed a cop. (Chuckles)

You know, well I haven't
kissed a caveman in a while.

(mellow piano music)

All right, see if you can
get a cross reference on it.

Thanks a lot.

Bugsy, woow, yeah!

Hey, donuts fresh, coffee's
fresh, help yourself.

Good morning.

Mornin'

Wow.

Hey there desert dogs,
it came together.

Well let's not jump
to any conclusions.

references, Bugs?

Okay, let's check it out here.
(keys slapping)

Here we go.

(keys slapping)

There you go.

How do they match up?

All right, let's see here.

(keys slapping)

There we go.

Yeah, print that, right
there, right there.

(keys slapping)

They're all redheads.

They all appear to be redheads.

You know what, there's
something about this redhead.

Why she remind you of one
of your beach bunnies?

All right, knock it off, come on.

Let's do some cop work.

Nazarae, look at this man.

I can't believe this
guy's still a free man.

(shutter snaps)

He's gotta be involved
in this somehow.

every photo we pulled.

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

You know, it's not like I

got the greatest look at this girl.

I never forget a pretty face.


Well, I'll tell you, some
people prefer girls.

Why don't you have another look.

I don't know, I can't
tell for sure.

Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.

Sorry.

You have a precious evening, huh?

See you soon.

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

Well right now, we don't
know if the relationship

between the victims and the
hookers means anything.

You think one of them
might be the killer?

I don't know, this is all
we got to go on right now.

I checked one possible
eyewitness, and he couldn't

give me a positive ID
on any of the photos.

What'd you have on the girls?

Well Cherie and Rosalind
were still current

employees of the agency
at that time of the bust.

Apparently, the third
on here, Christine,

she booked out a long time ago.


Give it tot he FBI, we'll turn
it around on a nation-wide.

Good, good.

We checked the girls'
most recent addresses

and they both skipped.

We're holding three other
girls and a secretary

from the agency, so I
figure if we squeeze 'em

a little bit, they may
do a little singing.

Hey Dan, you got a cigarette?

You gotta light?

(lighter flicking on)

These things are gonna kill ya.


(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

(suspenseful music)

(shutter snap)

All the working girls have
had priors, minor stuff,

but it's the first
time down for Lilly.

She was a receptionist.

Divorced, single parent.

According to the
neighbors, she takes

really good care of her kid.

Ew, you checked
with the neighbors?

(hand smack)

Good cop work, right?

Anyway, she even tried to get
him in a private school.

St. Anthony's?

Yeah.

So what happened?

She couldn't afford it.

So the hookers
make all the bread,

and she's just at
clerical minimum wage?

Yeah.

She's really scared, Joe.

I don't think she's gonna talk.

Well I got an idea.

I'm gonna make a few calls
before I talk to her.

That's real good work.

(church bells ringing)


And where were you the other day.

I reserved a court
for us to play on.

Hey, after that20-point blowout

you had on me last week, well
what do you think I am,

some kinda masochist?

You expect me to comeback
for a little more?

Eh, listen to the big baby.

What? I hurt our feelin's?

You got the height,
I got the moves.

Yeah, you didn't
tell me your college

roommate was Mugsy Bokes.

It's slippery little guys like you

that take advantage of
big slow guys like me.

Okay.

All right, we're on.

Same place, same time, and hey...

you better grease up those
snickers of yours peewee,

because I'm takin' you
to the hole this time.

Okay, you're on.

And I promise to cut
down on my cursing, okay?

All right.

Oh, uh, I almost
forgot why I called.

Listen, Father, I'm gonna
need a big favor from you.

It's about this lady and her son.


I can't believe this
is happening to me.

Who will take care of my son?

Well he's fine, he's okay.


Here.

Thank you.


You think maybe you could
help us out on this?

I don't know.

Look, you got nothing
to worry about.

We've taken out the
LA operation too.

Really?

So whoever or
whatever is left over

from the business, they're not

gonna be interested
in what we want.

So you, just take your time.

(papers rustling)

What's this?

It's a friend of mine over at St.
Anthony's,

he's got a couple of
scholarships available,

said he has one for your
son if you want it.

There's also a clerical
position available,

doesn't pay much, but they
have free on-campus housing

for staff.

So if you think you
might be interested...

Thanks.

What do you wanna know?

There he is, Tony Nazarae, your
typical, dangerous,

bonafide creep.

Drugs, prostitution, guns,
you name it.

For some reason, he's
tied into every operation

in town.

He specializes in high-end hookers,

and that's where our
girls have gone.

Now he's going big-time.

He's starting to take over
everybody's operation.

But before that happens, we're
gonna get him.

Folks, he's going down, and
he's going down hard.

I want you to stake him out.

I want you on him
like ugly on an ape.

[Police Dispatcher]
Adam 12, go ahead.

(muffled speaking
from police radio)

(suspenseful music)

[Male Voice] Ha-ha-ha-ha.

This is it.

(female shrieking)

(gun blast)

(door busting open)


He's gone.

He went out the back stairwell?

Bugs, he went out the
back, Mike's on him.

Get dressed girls where gonna
have to have a little talk.

(suspenseful music)


(suspenseful music)


(suspenseful music)

[Over Mic, Bugs] Do you read,

Nazarae is heading
out the back door.

We're in pursuit.

(suspenseful music)

Okay, I'm moving right
now 'round the back.

(engine starting)

(struggling yells)

(gun blast)

(Bugs grunting)


(suspenseful music)


(suspenseful music)

Ugh, ugh, uh, help me.

Ugh, ugh, ugh...

What's wrong man, what's wrong?

Help me.


Don't look at me like
that you son of a bitch.

(gun blast)

Go my friend, you think it hurts?

Go, go ahead, go to the
hospital, come on.

Go, get up, go, go, go,
get out of here.

(gun blast)

(suspenseful music)

(gun blasts)


(suspenseful music)

(gun blasts)

(sirens wailing)

Joe, Joe, Joe!

(gun blasts)

(tires squealing)

(gun blasts)

(tires squealing)


Go ahead, move, move.

Come on.

right to remain silent,

anything you say can and you
damn well better believe

used against you in a court of law.

You have the right to
request an attorney,

if you can not afford one, one
will be appointed to you

before questioning.

Do you understand these rights?

Let me ask you a
question, my friend...

What is your name.

Owens, Joe Owens.

(devilish laugh)

Is that right?

(gun chambers)

(gun clicks)


You got his ass.


fine, I'm fine.

Got you!

(mellow jingle)

Girls, your blood
tests came back clean,

so you're off the hook.

I do need your help with
one thing though, uh...

do you recognize her?

Yes.

Yeah, uh-huh.

We all started with Tony.

And Christine was
mostly a loner though.

Cherie and I, we always hung out,

but we could never
get through to her.

The three of us went to
the Place at the same time,

but she was just in
it for the money.

I mean, she never got into
the drugs or the parties

or anything.

Did she do something wrong?

Well, do you know whether
she's in town or not?

I don't know.

I remember she had
only a few clients,

and she dropped out of
business a few years ago,

and we haven't seen her since.

We were never friends.

Last I heard, which
was some time ago,

she was supposedly seeing a cop.

Thank you.

(suspenseful music)

Anyway, the strange
thing was, she said

the last rumor she heard
was that Christine

was dating a cop.

Ew, a cop, huh?

It was probably Mike.

Hi Mike.

Hey.

What do you need?

I need the 1990 photo album

from the annual picnic thing.

Oh sure, let me see
if I can find it.

Thank you.

Here it is, 1990, first year
on the job if I recollect.

Yes.

What are you looking for?

I'm just looking
for something, okay?

(suspenseful music)

had a few more clients,

can you pop up the names?

You know who you talkin' to?

Son here, I can bring it up.

Well, who the hell's John Doe?


Bring back Douglas.

Douglas, Douglas...

Woot, there it is.

Douglas Harbaugh, well
there's a number.

Let's call.

You ready?

I want in.

(phone ringing)


Hey pop, how the waves out there?


I can't complain.

How you doin'

retired cops, miserable.

Don't ever retire.

Of course, workin' in
Vegas compared to LA

is like being retired, right?

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

trouble or something?

No, no, no, nothing like that.

I gotta question to ask you.

Now what would you
do if you suspected

one of your fellow officers?


No, no, it's not one
of the boys on the take,

it's just, um,
actually, it's the captain.


Yeah, and I think he might
be involved in a murder.

you told anyone?

No, I haven't told anyone.

damn sure that you're

right about this,
and make damn sure

that your ass if covered.

You got it?

Yeah, I got it.

careful on this one.

Okay.

if you need anything.

All right, I'll
talk to you later.


All right, bye.

(electronic a, foreboding music)


Douglas Harbaugh please.

Hi Doug, it's Christine.

I got your page?

Tomorrow night, Maxim,
10 o'clock, that'll be fine.

Is red still your favorite color?

Really?

No, I won't wear panties.

I'll get a suite at the Maxim.

Okay, bye.

I don't like it when you do that.

Dan, that's my
job, you know that.

That's what I do.

(scintillating music)

(objects smashing)

No!

(mellow jingle)

Morning Joe.

Morning Heather, the boss in?

No he's not in.

He took a three-day
leave of absence.

He left yesterday.

A three-day leave of absence?

Is there an echo in here?

What the hell's going on.

Where is he?

Joe, you're just not
morning people are you?

How the heck should I know.

He left on personal
business, he said he'd

be back Monday.

I don't like to pry
like some people do.

Did get he the information back

on one of our suspects, he
called the FBI?

He never called the FBI.

He called the FBI.

He never called
the FBI, and if he

had called the FBI, I
would have known.

I would have placed that call.

Hey, don't take... You-_-_.

You better not go in there.

He's not gonna like this.

(mellow piano music)

(door shutting)

(keys rattling)

(shuffling trash)

(suspenseful music)

Well hang onto this one.

Give it to the FBI.

What the hell?

What?

(children playing in the distance)

(doors shutting)

(door knocks)

Something's wrong in there.

(suspenseful music)

Dan?

Dan, ya here, it's Joe.

(cat screeching)

(suspenseful music)

Clear.

Oh, look at this.

It's Christine.

You think Bronski beat John Doe?

God, I hope not.

Let's go.

(suspenseful music)

Dan?

(electronic sound effect)

It's Mike!

Mike!

Is he alive?

Oh, thank God, he's
still breathing.

Oh, Mike.

Come on, come on, come on.

Owens, homicide here, we
got an officer down,

10616 Andrew's place.

One-zero-six-one-six
Andrew's Place.

She's been here, Joe.

Well if she's involved with Dan,

what the hell's Mike doin' here?

Bronski's gotta be John Doe.

Eh, this really stinks.

Look, Doug Harbaugh.

10 pm, Maxims.

He's gotta be next.

Call Bugs.

Hang in there Mike.



(suspenseful music)

Well, Doug said you'd Bethe
most beautiful woman

in the bar, and he ain't lyin'.

You are Christine, aren't you?

I'm Christine and I'm flattered.

Well Doug detained on business,

mind if I sit down?

No, please do.

Can I get a beer, please?

Relic from my past.

Lucky charm?

Don't know.

That's my lucky charm.


Oh yeah.

Oh, good pitch,
Joe, you mac-daddy you.

So, Doug's a busy man?

And successful.

And successful?

Mm-Hmm.

So, tell me Joe, are
you successful?

Oh yeah.

Nice boots, how'd you
like to take them off

and have a good time...

Well, when I have a good time,

I like to keep my boots on.

(suspenseful music)

All right, he's on his
way to the elevator.

Okay, he's on the elevator.

Where you goin' Joe?

Where you goin'

Mmm, soft 17, gets me
in trouble every time.

Soft 17.

Come on, say it, say it, say it.

Come on, we need a room number.

What's the number?

(elevator dings)

So what room you stayin' in?

17-17.

That's funny.

I was in room 17-17 when
I was at Bally's.

Must be fate.

What?

I didn't get it.

Damn!


(door closing)

Why don't you make
yourself at home?

Oh, I will.


Love my job.

You need a hand in there?


(suspenseful music)

Medication, CFS.

CFS, that's the chronic
fatigue syndrome, huh?

You don't look like
you are fatigued.

No rest for the wicked.

(heels clomping)

Mind if I leave this open?

No, that's fine.

Now, couches are fun, but...

Thank you (mumbles)use
your phone.

Make sure they got the stairwells,

and have them cut the
power in the elevator.

Back up, do you read?

I read you.

We got back up coming up and

Operator, this is
Officer Thompson,

Dan, what is going on here?

What is this?

This is your life Christine.

This is what you made me do!

I'm cleaning up all your lovers!

What are you talking about?

What I've done for you!

Take it easy, Dan.

They're all dead, Christine.

I killed 'em all.

Hey Dan, you gotta cigarette?

Gotta light?

These things are gonna kill ya.

Oh, one tight package.

Good.

Mike, I wanna tell
you, you did your part,

you did it well.

Thank you sir.

Check it out, check it out.


and in apparently um-marked car.

Just a few weeks ago, Nazarae, was

arrested for drug
trafficking and murder.

Police have unconfirmed
reports of...

Let's go! We've got work to do.

Wait up, wait
up, wait up, wait up!

Owens, you're dead.

You and your
friends, you're all dead.

(suspenseful music)
