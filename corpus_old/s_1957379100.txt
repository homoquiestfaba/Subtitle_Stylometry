Woman, woman, woman...a man's got to have at least one.

I've had many, but now my lust for conquest, freedom and adventure has given

way to my true sense of responsibility. I
want and I need a woman for me. To be

mother to my kids, someone to grow old
with, my mate for life.

Incredible, out of all the woman I've bedded, me inside of them becoming one. Making

the creature with two backs . The most
sacred act two people can carry out.

It was so wrong and yet so right, and still
I am alone.

womanless, aimlessly hustling the streets.

Woman, woman, woman...

sure I could find a quick piece,
that's easy, there is a time in every

man's life when casual and shallow sex
is no longer sought after. I want real

intimacy and affection and to get it I'll
walk these cold, miserable, godforsaken

streets until I find her. She must be a
friend, a lover and yes sometimes even a

mother and it's a two-way street.
I will nurture her with my love. I will

make her happy when she is sad. I will
heal her when she is sick. I will cook

for her when she is hungry.
I will dedicate my life to understanding,

sacrificing and respecting her and her
alone, and in return all I want is her love.

Her unrestrained, unconditional love. Dammit there's some one for everyone and I'm

on a hunt to find the huntress. That
some one from me!

Hey Harold! What's up sugar?

Look like you got something on your mind baby, cuz I damn sure got pain on mine. Ooh, my damn feet hurt

shit. Was a time when things was
jumping out here but them damn crackheads

then came out here and messed up

gonna sell my ass for a lousy two
dollars. I wouldn't let a nigga smell it

for that! Huh!

Eating out of garbage like he ain't never had no kind of home training or nothing.

But he shows a good lookout, see all kind
of shit up in that tree. Last Thursday

night I did this trick in his car and he
tried to get funny with my money. I said

wait a minute nigga that's my man up in
that tree he don't want no shit tonight.

He saw woodpecker sitting in that tree, he liked to shit on his self.

Paid me my money and gave me a tip. When me and you gonna do a little somethin' Harold?

Huh, you and me will have a good time baby cuz this some good red pussy.

Ooh! 'bout time!

Two dollar crack head hoes...

Two dollar crackhead hoes, damn my feet and they hurtin', Ooh my goodness and she had the

nerve to look at me like that. Huh, shh and wit my feet been hurtin' I've been standing out here

Stop! Stop!

He was too!

He wasn't!

He was too!

You talkin' bout' the one that got away...

Ray Robinson was best welter weight to step inside of a ring.

You gots to be crazy! Ray Leonard will walk all over Ray Robinson's ass and forget to jump off.

I'll tell you who was a bad ass now. Sweet Pretty Pete Jackson. Pretty Pete kick all that ass yawl talkin' 'bout.

The Pretty Pete Sweep!

What ever happened to him?

Panties, garters, brassieres and slips? I sell them wholesale and I know they'll fit...

I heard he moved out of the country.

I heard he killed himself playing Russian Roulette.

Got anymore of the lace thongs Harold?

Give me one of them Leapord skin brassieres in a 38D sweet heart.

Me too Harold, but I need a 32 A...I mean, it's still a mouth full.

For who's mouth?

No you didn't...no you didn't.

Yes I did...

You get those crotchless black panties for me?

Got 'em right here.

Well listen now, slip 'em to me on the sly. What I wear under my clothes is my business.

Something wrong?

Harold, how come you don't trim some of that beard off of your face?

Your mouth look just like Wolf pussy!

You really think so?

I know so.

But I thought this is the kind of thing that the ladies like.

Look at your mouth. Man, cut that hair off of your face.

But this is a good trim...maybe...I don't know...

It look nasty! That's what it look.

Nasty?

Nasty! Cut that stuff off of your face.

Nasty!

How nasty?

Real nasty!

But it don't look like no wolf pussy.

I'll tell you one thing. You may not be able to cut the mustard, but you can't even lick the lid with all that on your mouth.

I'll think about it...

You need to.

Child! Your mama ain't told you that yet?

Now ain't this a bitch? Oh forgive me, this is a mother fucker. Miss prim and proper buys her under panties on the sneak tip!

I bet she buys crotchless!

Shit! If the nigga to tired to pull 'em down then the hell with him honey...

Hey, It would take one hell of a fishermen to pull down them under patties.

Kiss my double black ass Rumpadoo!

The both of you could kiss my bumpy,
lumpy black ass!

Everybody in here can kiss my pretty black ass!

All right Floreen, you can kiss my ass too!

You're wrong Rumpadoo.

Well you can kiss my black ass too Hubcap!

No he didn't...no he didn't!

Yes he did! Yes he did! Yes he did!

Okay, here's to no ass!

I just got off from work and came in here for a drink man. What kind of a joint is this?

Terrible

No ass!

This is he first time that I ever saw a woman like that in a place like this.

You's a 'bout a bad bitch.

Will you leave me the hell alone!

Aw right.

Her name is Maria.

Yeah, niggers been hitting on her all night.

Just like flies!

Yeah and she been swatting them away as fast as they come.

You feel lucky?

I think I do.

She sure is good looking.

Gosh she's beautiful.

I ain't gonna argue with you about that.

She's turning on the town.

I think she is.

You better get moving before you get crowded out man.

You going over there, you going over there?

If yawl give me a chance to get one
thing in, I'm gonna try my luck. You never know.

You better get there before the heard comes.

Harold! Let me lay something on you.

Slip this under your hat.

That's right.

Panties, garters, brassieres and slips. I
sell them wholesale and I know they'll fit.

Extra tall, extra large, medium and small,
don't worry about the color cuz I got them all.

No thank you.

How about a nice
half cotton slip?

I don't wear slips.

I got some really nice--

--Nor panties.

You don't have any panties on?

No.

Then, how about some a-a-a sheer stockings?

Look if I buy your goddamn stockings will you

leave me the hell alone?

Sure, sure um what size do you wear?

I don't know you'll have to fit me?

You want me to fit you? You want me to put the stockings on you here?

Sure, why not?

Okay.

I think this is far enough.

I don't.

I want you more than I've ever wanted a
woman in my life.

I wanna make love to you all night long.

There's something I have to tell you first.

We've already wasted enough time talking,
I want you now.

Hi baby

Do you love me?

Hey baby!

Hey, I need you so bad...

So bad...

Oh yes, take me!

Oh baby I want you now.

I want this to be right.

Oh come on I need you now.

I want you to do something for me.

What do you want me to do?

I want you to go into the bathroom while I get ready for you.

Oh Jesus...what have I done!?

Nevermind, keep it, keep it on, pull it up, pull it up, turn around

trying to do nothing nothing, we can't do
nothing.

Sweet Pretty Pete...

You really are Sweet Pretty Pete.

Sweet Pretty Pete!

What happened?

I came to the realization
that I was a woman

trapped inside a man's body.

I don't normally go to bars and pick up
strange men, I was just a little upset

with my boyfriend

just last week I caught Alan in the bed
with my best friend

and what's so funny
I would take him back

but I think they're together

loneliness...Oh God.

loneliness can be such an awful thing.
I need someone to love someone to come

home to someone to care for

if you weren't a man--

--I'd better go I
better go, but before I do I have

something for you

Wait a second don't
don't do it don't do this to yourself--

Relax, I have a girlfriend. Her name is
Sally. She's a very nice girl, a lot like me.

How much is this Sally like you?

She's very much a woman.

Harold
I was wondering

if it's not too much to ask

could you hold me before I go

Okay come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... let's do it.

Hello Sally

this is a great place you
have here. It's so isolated from everything

It helps with my writing and you
don't have to lock your doors

oh so you write, what kind of stuff?

I write primarily for children I'm working

on my tenth publication

interesting

I love children. Do you have any?

No

I don't. have any kids. I've been very careful where I plant my seeds.

So how do you know Maria?

I met her on a plane out of
Miami. We sat together. I was so impressed

with her commitment to find her soul
mate. She invited me over to her place

once we got back to New York, we stayed
up half the night girl talking

soon I found myself confiding in her

Harold, I never been with a man, the mere thought of it brings on a fear so deep

I can't spread my wings.

I think you're making this a lot more complicated than what it is

Have you ever heard of the Tuskegee
study?

The syphilis study done somewhere in the south?

Macon County Alabama, that's
where I'm from. The government called it

an experiment where 600 black men over
40 year period were used as human guinea pigs

for a syphilis study. My daddy was one
of those guinea

It was hell coming up with daddy. He tormented me to his last days.

My mother couldn't take so she left, it was just me and daddy. A week didn't go by that he didn't

neglect warning me about what happens to
fornicators, oftentimes exposing me to

the syphilitic lesions that ate away at
his body. One afternoon I was coming from

school with a classmate of mine. Boy's name was Johnny Brown. He was holding my hand

it was completely innocent

daddy saw us

I was tied up

called a whore

and whipped like an animal

My god!

that's when the whippings began. I was 11 years old they continued for years until

he was too weak to administer them

finally daddy died

I'm sorry

my daddy had one indiscretion in his life

that is how he thought he contracted the disease, when all along it was the government

who inoculated him with it

syphilis spread to his brain causing his
insanity so it really wasn't his fault

still every time I think about getting
close to a man, I hear daddy's warning

coming from the grave. Maria must have
had some real special reason for giving

you my number. I mean we really
identified with one another

Well actually so did she and I.

So can I see you tomorrow for dinner?

Haven't you been listening to me? I have a man phobia

It's okay, I understand.

Get your hands off me--

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

I'm sorry I don't really laughs you are
so cute

tea's ready

How many sugars do you take?

Two

ah thank you

these are for you

thank you...they're beautiful

I've been calling you every day

I know

I got all of your messages

I didn't mean to pass out on our first date.

for some reason I just got so sleepy

that's not why I hadn't returned your calls

actually I like hearing the sound of
your voice

I just wanted to see if you were really
interested in me

of course I am

see now I feel guilty. Will you forgive me?

there's nothing to forgive

I made some cookies...come on

I want to fly

you know, we should be using condoms

you have nothing to worry about

I'm on the pill

Oh Oh...

what's wrong?

Oh Oh...

you okay

I'm sorry

it's alright...we got all night

Oh...

oh God...

What's wrong?

Nothing.

I can tell when something's bothering

you dr. Lydia Patricia Smith.

How much longer?

It's not like I have any control over this.

It's been a month already.

I know!

Let's give it a few more weeks, we don't
want to lose him, he's just the right type.

What's that supposed to mean? You
know damn well what this is supposed to

mean.
We are in this together.

Yeah I know.
When I think about him touching you it just

makes me crazy!

I am your woman and yours alone.

I want it when I want it! I can't help it if 
I have a headache!

bullshit you men kill me!
All ways claiming you want it all the time

but when you're faced with a real woman
you go running for cover!

If the shoe was on the other foot!

If the shoe were on the other foot I would

not pressure you!

What kind of man are
you? I'm your woman and I want you.

Can't you handle your business?

Now you're trying to mess with my head, that won't work.

Then if I can't get it from you
I'll have to go elsewhere

You're not serious are you?

Of course not, I want only one man.

Wait wait don't take

it easy wait, wait Hold it! No, no, no! You are too rough, too rough!

You used to be gentle!

Where do you think
you're going?

I've got to go somewhere in sync

I got to get away from you!

You get your ass back here!

You're a freak

I'm your man and you wanted me, that is
more than any man can ask for, yes you

are a freak but you're a freak from me, I
don't want to lose you, so I'm here to

give you what you want, as much as you
want, as long as you want

funny, how after a fight the need to
make up is like a deep itch. I want

you so bad...oh yeah...but you're still
angry with me

your body is so tense and hard. I never
felt it like this before, I take the

blame, I take the blame, just don't reject
me like this

all I ask is that you give me another
chance to prove myself.

I promise you, I won't disappoint you

you and I were meant to be, I mean you
and I can conquer the world

I feel it

I feel it deep in my soul,

what I'm saying is that together, we can conquer the world

I agree

hey lover I'm home

who are you?

oh shit

What's going on?

who are you?

my name is Lydia I'm Sally sister

I'm sorry sis I didn't know you had
company

we're trying to have a baby

what's going on

Sally is my lover we're trying to have a baby

is this true

what's the big deal

why didn't you go to a sperm bank

we'd rather test and
slaughter our own chickens thank you

shouldn't I have had a say in this

give me a break! You've sewn your Wild Oats

probably knocked up more than your fair
share and now you want to stand up and be counted?

take it like a man, you've been fucked

you're using me, just like the people who
used your father

Oh that Tuskegee line again? Five months ago it was the Watts riot

Give me those feet--

I donâ€™t mean to intimidate you at all

But if I donâ€™t tell you

You canâ€™t know what I want

Some donâ€™t express the need

Cause there insecure

I donâ€™t have that problem you can rest assure

If you want to arouse and you want to turn me on

Take your hands and place them where they belong

All over my body baby every curve and serve

Iâ€™ll show how if you want to learn

Fell me--Oh feel my body gently baby

Feel me--Caress my body all night long

Feel me--Take the time to learn my body

Feel me--Oh thatâ€™s the way to turn me on

If try to run before you can walk

Youâ€™re sure to stumble and fall

Either take the time to learn all my needs

Or donâ€™t expect to satisfy me at all

If you want to arouse me and if you want to turn me on

Take your hands and place them where they belong

All over my sweet body baby--baby

If you want to satisfy me, then

Fell me--Oh feel my body gently baby

Feel me--Caress my body all night long

Feel me--Take the time to learn my body

Feel me--Oh thatâ€™s the way to turn me

I want to give you a piece of my
womanhood you couldn't feel in my kiss

my mind can move mountains and shapely
as my hips

I'm glad you enjoy my physical peak but
if you can't stimulate my brain then

brother you are a weak see to impress me
with material things diamond rings

The wounds caused a partial
evisceration of the genitals resulting

in a major loss of blood. Right now he's
in guarded but stable condition. The

concern is that, he may make another
attempt at killing himself. In fact, it is

a certainty that he will.

Doesn't she realize what she's doing?

The problem is, emotionally and physically, he sees himself as a woman,

with the exception of his genitals.

Genitals that lie about who he is.

Self castration is his way of telling the

truth, even if it means killing himself.

Something has to be done.

He's a prime

candidate for sexual reassignment, the
problem is, such an operation cost ten

thousand dollars and there are no
insurance programs that cover it.

and coupled with the costs of reconstructive
plastic surgery for his face

you're talking another five thousand.

You mean, for a measly 15 grand she's gonna die?

Love is the symbiotic twin of friendship
and like love, if you find one true

friend in a lifetime, you can count
yourself as lucky.

A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Only the brave can walk the path that
leads to love. In spite of my faults and

insecurities, I shall continue to walk
the path, a path not for the meek or

arrogant, an oftentimes lonely path,
nonetheless...I walk...

It was recently reported in a local
newspaper of the untimely death of doctor

Robinson. Talk is he was out for a
midnight stroll when for no apparent

reason he was pounced upon. Why remains a

mystery.

Thanks to the miracles of modern
technology and a generous benefactor

Maria's plastic surgery was a success as
well as her other operation. She even

went on get married and have kids. Well
she actually didn't give birth.

She adopted Debbie and her baby sister
Rochelle.

The mystery as to why woodpecker
couldn't speak like normal people

was learned just a few weeks ago. At the age of five woodpecker

witnessed the rape of his beloved mother
by several men. Speaking of finding one

soul mate, it seems that's exactly what a
woodpecker has found.

They call her Hummingbird. I can't make this stuff up. Hard to believe he found someone to sit

up in the trees with them at night. You
never know who's watching you, just look

up. Might be woodpecker and...Hummingbird looking back at cha.

A child a baby was left at my doorstep
on one of the most beautiful mornings

God ever created. I knew immediately this
child was a part of me.

Sally realized she was not cut out for raising a child. The joys and fears of fatherhood are many

hopefully the joys will outweigh the
fears. Right now my baby needs nurturing

and so do I. Hmm, I finally got my girl.

Life is very simple now. Finally love has come

and found me. Like a lost puppy
in an unfamiliar neighborhood, I was

taken in from the cold. Just when I was
at my worst end, God looked down and

smiled, then bought me Joy. Joy is my daughter.

being with her fills me with constant
surprise. She continually pulls from my

heart, all the beautiful belongings
that no one else including myself had

looked quite far enough to find.

These are very nice. These are all mine?

uh-huh

Ah this is so nice.

This is so nice...

I love you.

I love you too.

For you.

I love you daddy.

I did it, I did it, I did it!

You did!

I should go.

Bye sweetheart.

My love for her is unconditional, which
time cannot mar or destroy, even though

she will one day leave my side in seek
of tomorrow's bright hopes with there

bitter sorrows. I will always be there
watching, yearning to hold her again to

my heart!

In the meantime, life is for the living
and it goes on.

Aren't the leaves just beautiful this
time of year?

Oh yes and the colors are

just so earthy.

Are you free tonight sugar?
