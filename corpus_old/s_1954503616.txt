<i>Dr. Behar.</i>

<i>Dr. Behar.</i>

<i>We're running out of
light, so if we're going</i>

<i>to do this we should
probably do it now.</i>

<i>Ready when you are.</i>

<i>We are now standing in front</i>
<i>of what I'm almost certain</i>

<i>to be the tomb of the lost
brother of King Siptah</i>

<i>who once ruled over the upper</i>
<i>and lower Egyptian valley</i>

<i>more than 2,000 years ago.</i>

<i>Everyone, including my peers, believed his
existence to be nothing more than a myth.</i>

<i>Well, we are now</i>
<i>about to prove them wrong.</i>

<i>For what you are seeing</i>
<i>behind me now</i>

<i>is the entrance to the tomb of what the
ancient Hebrews called the Cursed King.</i>

<i>Just the mere</i>
<i>mention of his name</i>

<i>was so utterly terrifying</i>
<i>to the ancient Egyptians</i>

<i>that even the symbol</i>
<i>for his name, the cat,</i>

<i>could not so much as be written
or pronounced by anyone.</i>

<i>Now won't you please</i>
<i>follow me, uh, Steven?</i>

<i>You see, Neferu,</i>
<i>the son of Harcoptis</i>

<i>was in succession</i>
<i>to be the king</i>

<i>when his younger brother Siptah</i>

<i>had him captured and mummified</i>
<i>while still alive.</i>

<i>And right down these tunnels</i>

<i>is where he was buried.</i>

<i>And this is where</i>
<i>we believe we will find him,</i>

<i>the king who cannot be named.</i>

<i>What was that, Steven?</i>

<i>What was that?</i>

<i>Jesus, what is that?</i>

<i>No. No! Jesus Christ!</i>

<i>I am a collector.</i>

<i>Treasures is what I seek.</i>

<i>I have possessed the most precious
riches the world has ever known.</i>

<i>The rarest,</i>
<i>the most magnificent.</i>

<i>But one has eluded me</i>
<i>for all these years.</i>

<i>A precious jewel,</i>
<i>shrouded in mystery,</i>

<i>wrought with danger.</i>

<i>It belonged</i>
<i>to a cursed king, Neferu,</i>

<i>a pharaoh, who some say still
haunts his final resting place,</i>

<i>seeking new victims.</i>

<i>A pharaoh who was buried
alongside a most precious stone.</i>

<i>A jewel of immense worth</i>

<i>and incredible power.</i>

<i>They call it,</i>

<i>the Kodek stone.</i>

<i>Only one man</i>

<i>can get it for me.</i>

<i>And his name is, Jack Wells.</i>

Hey, sexy.

<i>Like the presents?</i>

Carl?

What have you gone
and joined the NSA?

<i>- You do live an exciting life</i>
<i>for an archeology professor.</i>

I do what I can, Carl.

We're gonna be in the hot tub.

I suppose I have to thank you
for this package.

<i>Don't mention it.</i>

<i>It suits you.</i>

My birthday is still
a few months away,

so I suspect an ulterior motive

for this little
surprise of yours.

<i>Look closer.</i>

<i>That's right,</i>

<i>the camera's in the glasses.</i>

So you can see all this?

<i>I'm watching</i>
<i>everything that you are.</i>

<i>You're new glasses are transmitting
via a satellite uplink</i>

<i>to the comfort of my home.</i>

<i>You're eyes belong to me, Jack.</i>

I'll be a son of a bitch.

And how the hell did you get
your hands on these?

<i>I called in a favor</i>
<i>from a friend.</i>

You must have
some important friends,

this is not your standard
over-the-counter technology.

<i>I have my sources,</i>
<i>like you have yours.</i>

<i>There's something else</i>
<i>in the box.</i>

What's this?

<i>Something to make life easier.</i>

I hope it's sanitary.

<i>Stop fucking around, Jack,</i>
<i>time is of essence.</i>

<i>You hear me?</i>

Yeah, like you're
living in my head.

<i>Should keep us in contact</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

Okay, Santa, I got the gifts.

Now what do you want from me?

<i>I believe you know,</i>
<i>Jeremy Cooper.</i>

Yep, he is the biggest asshole
in the world of archeology.

<i>Indeed, but the asshole</i>
<i>is putting together a team</i>

<i>and I want you on it.</i>

What makes you think,
he'd want me to tag along?

He's not my biggest fan.

<i>You're still the best</i>
<i>Egyptologist he knows</i>

<i>and you can decipher</i>
<i>hieroglyphics</i>

<i>like you were born</i>
<i>speaking that gibberish.</i>

<i>Where he's going, he's gonna
need someone like you.</i>

<i>Strike that,</i>
<i>he's gonna need you.</i>

Hmm. Where's he going?

<i>His team is flying to Hijaza</i>
<i>in three days.</i>

Hijaza? What the hell
are they doing there?

<i>Neferu.</i>

Neferu, the cursed king?
Come on.

Carl, that's a myth.

<i>Not anymore,</i>
<i>according to Professor Behar.</i>

<i>He's very much real.</i>

Behar? Hey, didn't he drop out of sight
two months ago while he was in Egypt?

<i>He did, but some Bedouins found his
camera out in the middle of nowhere.</i>

<i>Egyptian officials</i>
<i>got a hold of it.</i>

<i>The footage showed a tomb he
uncovered in the desert near Hijaza.</i>

<i>Cooper wants to find it.</i>

Now, Carl why do you care
so much about a tomb?

I never figured you to be interested
in anything other than money.

<i>That I am.</i>

<i>You ever hear of</i>
<i>the Kodek stone?</i>

Yeah, the diamond.

<i>Yes, the diamond.</i>

<i>Story goes that it was buried</i>
<i>with the cursed king,</i>

<i>a very precious gift</i>
<i>from his brother Siptah,</i>

<i>to keep, Neferu's soul</i>
<i>from coming back.</i>

<i>Cursed kings had a bad habit of
rising from the dead back then</i>

<i>and doing all sorts of</i>
<i>bad stuff to the living.</i>

So, you're after
the Kodek stone.

What, you're too lazy
to do your own dirty work?

<i>I rather you get out there and
break your neck, it's much easier.</i>

Very altruistic Carl,
as always.

<i>You get me the stone and you
and me will call it even.</i>

<i>Wipe the slate clean.</i>

What if I tell you
to go fuck yourself?

<i>Well...</i>

<i>Then the Egyptian authorities</i>
<i>will receive a file</i>

<i>proving that</i>
<i>the Howard Carter artifacts</i>

<i>aren't as genuine</i>
<i>as they think.</i>

<i>And the details of your
involvement in their replacement.</i>

Guess I better go
grab my toothbrush, Carl.

I'm not that surprised the Behar
was searching the cursed earth.

He always insisted that Neferu's
tomb had to be out here somewhere.

It would have been
a great insult to his brother.

And it would have prevented his soul
from crossing over to the afterlife.

What do you think, Dr. Wells, are
we looking in the right place?

<i>Dr. Wells?</i>

What was the question?

We were wondering, if you think
we're looking in the right place.

The Bedouins claim they found
Behar's camera out there

chances are he was with it.

<i>Well, they could have stolen it</i>

stumbled across Behar and his assistant,
killed them and raided their equipment.

<i>Keep your mind</i>
<i>on the job, Jack,</i>

<i>you're not there to add another
notch to your bedpost.</i>

They only had
the camera with them.

Behar would have had thousands of
dollars of equipment with him.

Isn't that right, Dr. Cooper?

<i>He had access</i>
<i>to the latest equipment,</i>

geo-physical, thermo and
access to full GPS systems.

No self-respecting university would
have signed off on the search.

Yet, we've all seen the footage

and we're all here
following in his footsteps.

<i>Someone at Brown's</i>
<i>might have signed the check.</i>

I may not agree with many,
if any, of Behar's theories,

but he had clearly
found a tomb.

We owe it to him to prove
that he was right or not.

Talking like he's already dead.

Well, there's been no contact
with him for over three months.

If he's not dead,
he's as good as.

And nobody's concerned why?

Well, that's why
you brought me along.

What do you do, Kate?

I work for
a private security firm.

Oh, let me stop you before
you make a fool of yourself

by making some crass
chauvinistic remark, Dr. Wells.

I know I'm a woman.

And why are you here,
Dr. Wells?

What use do we have
of your talents?

Dr. Wells is an Egyptologist.

One of the best.

He specializes
in regional dialects.

Oh, I've heard differently.

If you're talking
about the little scrape I had

with the Egyptian authorities
last year,

regarding the
tomb of Kaumudi's artifacts.

And I can absolutely guarantee you,
it was just a miscommunication.

There's no need to explain
yourself to me, Dr. Wells.

<i>Sounds like your</i>
<i>reputation precedes you.</i>

Sounds like your
reputation precedes you.

What about the Kodek stone?
Do you believe that's real?

Kodek stone is a myth.

Behar believed it was real.
Based his entire career on it.

Yeah, look where it got him.

Anyone who believes the Kodek
stone is real is a fool.

<i>- You talking to me?</i>
Anyone.

What do they want?
It'll be nothing.

Probably want to see
our papers.

And if they're a problem, I'm
sure they can be persuaded.

Papers, please.

Don't...
What?

Cause any trouble.

Leave that to me.

They want to see
all of our papers.

Passport. Passport.
Where's my passport?

Calm down, bookworm.
What?

And try to breathe
every once in a while.

Passport, Dr. Wells.

I trust everything is in order.

On your way, be careful.

People have been
known to go missing.

Although it would be very bad for such
a pretty lady never to be seen again.

What's got you
looking so worried?

I always look worried.

Probably because
I'm always worried.

You shouldn't be. I might not like
Cooper, but he knows what he's doing.

You've seen Behar's
footage, right?

Yeah.

-I think he was onto something.
-Yeah.

Just got me so worried.

Let's get back on the road.

Everyone out.

Ladies first.

Never claimed I was a lady,
but I appreciate the offer.

<i>Eyes on the prize, Jack,</i>
<i>not the ass.</i>

Look like a prize to me.
Who's the Egyptian?

<i>He's your guide, Rashid Hassan</i>

<i>and he comes highly recommended,
so try not to insult him.</i>

Do my best.

<i>He was a leading figure with the
rebels who overthrew Hosni Mubarak.</i>

What's he doing here
in the ass end of nowhere?

<i>Some of his views were
considered by many as extreme.</i>

<i>Let's say he just needed</i>
<i>a change of air.</i>

Can we trust him?

<i>I don't know about that, but he knows this
cursed earth better than any man alive.</i>

I'd like you in the lead
with Hassan.

I think I'll join in.

Jack Wells, Egyptologist.

Hassan.

Dr. Behar was very
passionate man.

What he didn't know about Siptah,
Neferu wasn't worth knowing.

You knew him well, then?

Yes, ever since
I was young boy.

My father was his guide,
and I took over.

So, you took him
into the cursed earth?

Yes, many time.

He was constantly
searching for the tomb.

And when he went missing?

On that instance, the good
doctor ventured out alone.

He didn't want anyone
to know his location.

With age he grew paranoid.

He believed everyone was out
to steal the find from him.

Take the glory.

What do you think
happened to him, Hassan?

The cursed earth is not the
safest place for a man to walk.

He could have easily been
turned around in a sand storm,

died of exposure.

You believe that?

Sand is very hungry, Dr. Wells.

If you don't tread carefully,

it will bite.

<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the cursed earth, Jack.</i>

I can think of places,
I'd rather be.

We all could.

Maybe when we're done here.

Is that a come on, Dr. Wells?

Jack, call me Jack.

I hate all that
"Doctor" bullshit.

Okay, Jack.

Maybe when we're done.

<i>I don't believe this.</i>

Come,

once you've unpacked and set up
camp I've arranged for food.

And then we sleep.

We have much traveling
to do tomorrow.

<i>What the hell's going on, Jack?</i>

We're about to find out.

<i>Seems like Hassan hasn't been
greasing the right palms.</i>

It's just what we need.

Put the gun down, you all, now.

Let go of me!

Your man touched me first!

What seems to be
the problem here?

This is a restricted area,
you must not be here.

I can assure I've been granted
full access to this area

for myself and my team.

You show me.

<i>It's time for you to take over.</i>

What the hell
am I supposed to do?

<i>Exactly what I tell you, now get
over there and sound authoritative.</i>

These are not valid. That's
impossible, check them again.

I'll deal with this. Not valid.
You must go.

Who are you?

<i>-Who I am is of no concern...
</i> Who I am is of no concern,

<i>- ...who I know is.</i>
Who I know is.

And who do you know?

<i>- Naseem Abubakar.</i>
Naseem Abubakar.

I see you know the name.

Well, if you continue to fuck
with me and my colleagues

Naseem will fuck with you,
understand?

<i>Don't, don't push it, Jack.</i>

On your way, but you may
regret the decision later.

From here, we will
have to travel by foot.

Why can't we just
take the cars?

Look for yourself.

Beyond the horizon

lies a cursed earth.

The cursed earth.

Yes, Dr. Wells.

<i>Behar's last GPS signal puts him within
a day's travel of you current location.</i>

You're quite sure this is
where Dr. Behar was heading?

This is what he told me, yes.

What made him think, he'd
find Neferu's tomb out here?

He did not say.

But he knew,

you could see it in his eyes.

You okay there, Marty?

Oh, I'm fine,

this body was built
for the great outdoors.

I don't get you, Jack Wells.

What's there to get?

I read about you.
And?

Definitely makes
for an interesting read.

You studied at Harvard,

you graduated
the top of your class,

and then you stepped
straight into a job

at the Archeological
Institute of America...

Oh, God!

Thanks.

Then you spent
six years in Egypt,

mostly working in Abu Rawash

and that's when things got
a little shady.

It seems you were accused of
falsifying King Tafari's seal?

Accused, never convicted.

Is there a difference?

About eight to 15.

Well, from
what I've seen so far,

you don't seem
like that guy at all.

Maybe I'll surprise you.

Maybe.

<i>-I want you to look at something.
</i> What?

<i>- Something you've missed.</i>
Where?

<i>-Over to the left.</i> Okay,
what am I looking at?

<i>You don't see it, do you?</i>

<i>The rock formation.</i>

<i>Look at the shape</i>
<i>of that rock formation,</i>

<i>they're the same as the one</i>
<i>on Behar's video.</i>

<i>We're close,</i>
<i>so close I can taste it.</i>

The history books are vague.

Most stating that Neferu was
the worst of the two brothers.

But there are many writings that purport
to Siptah having been far more nasty.

The writings are true.

Both brothers were corrupt.

But, no brother could do

what Siptah did to Neferu without
having evil in their veins.

If what I've read
about Neferu is true

he deserved what he got.

His army rode through Egypt,
slaughtering everyone in its path.

Power corrupts, my friend.

And the brothers held more power in their
hands than any man should ever hold.

But Siptah,
wasn't satisfied with sharing,

he wanted it all to himself.

So, he had his brother killed.

That's not uncommon
for the time though.

Many pharaohs acquired
their power through murder.

There is murder

and there is torture.

Siptah ordered that Neferu

be nailed to the ground

and his chest be cut open
while he was still breathing

and then had salt poured onto
his still beating heart.

He was screaming for mercy,

as they cut away
his nose with a chisel

and forced a barbed hook
all the way up into his skull.

Lady here needs a drink.

Cooper.

<i>- We're getting close, Jack.</i>
Over and out, Carl.

I think it's time I turned off
that little voice in my head.

Hey.
Hey.

You forgot this.
Oh...

Who were you
just talking to by the way?

Oh, just a little
voice in my head.

You're not going to let me
finish this by myself are you?

I think there's something else
I'd like to finish.

Keeping your eyes
on the prize, huh, Jack?

Kind of hard not to.

Ooh.

-You're not getting shy on me now are you?
-Get over here.

I guess there could be
worst places we could be.

-Really? I can't think of any
place I'd rather be. -Me, too.

<i>She's something else, Jack,</i>

<i>isn't, she?</i>

What the hell?
What?

It's just the little
voice in my head again.

Sorry, three's a crowd.

Hey,

about last night.

You don't have
to say anything, Kate.

I get it,

it was what it was.

You needed me and I needed you.

Nothing more, nothing less.

<i>You really know</i>
<i>how to treat a woman.</i>

Quit playing with the hired
help, Wells, and get over here.

Asshole.

Me or him? - Both.

<i>She's growing on me.</i>

Piss off, Carl.

Take a look at this,
tell me what you think.

What am I looking for?

I just want your opinion.

Dr. Cooper! Dr. Cooper!

You're gonna want to see this.

What it is, Baptiste?

I was taking a leak

and I think I found it.

What you find, Greg, your cock?

No, asshole,
the entrance to the tomb.

I found it.

That's great!

This is it people,
this is the tomb of Neferu.

I shall get camp ready.

Good man, Hassan, good man.

But this is clearly the same
place as on Behar's video.

Dr. Wells is right.

This may be where Behar
filmed his last footage.

No proof this is the
final resting place of Neferu.

No proof yet, but there will
be as soon as we get inside.

If any of you
still needed proof.

What is it, Dr. Cooper?

Hieroglyphics.

And this right here,

this is the katak,
the eye of the jackal,

it's the symbol of King Neferu.

Oh, it's magnificent.

This is the final
resting place...

Think about it, we could be the
first eyes cast upon his name

in over 2,000 years.

Unless Behar saw it before us.

I've got to record this.

Kate,

are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Wells, I need...
We need your assistance.

You'll be okay?

I'm a big girl, Jack.
Go do your job.

<i>You heard the lady,</i>
<i>show me something exciting.</i>

What does it say?
Enlighten us.

This is rough. It's a dialect
I've not seen before.

But you can read it,
right, Jack?

Yeah, just give me a minute.

I hope I haven't wasted
funds, bringing you along.

You really don't like me
do you, Cooper?

This has nothing to do with my
personal feelings towards you.

Can you decipher
the glyphs or not?

Here lies the cursed king

under the heel of Anubis

and body on Aken's ferry,

the soul in between.

It's amazing,
it's simply amazing.

Is that the exact
translation, Wells?

Words to that effect.

There's more over here.

The <i> tilasm</i> will keep him

in the tomb.

A tealsman?

That's Arabic,
for the talisman.

Is it talking about
the Kodek stone?

Siptah buried
his brother with that.

He had to keep Neferu's soul from
coming back and avenging himself.

This is where the Kodek stone
enters the history books.

This is all getting to be
a bit unreal.

Not for the ancient
Egyptians, it wasn't.

The Kodek stone
was very real to them.

It meant to hold great power,

mystical power.

And you believe that crap?

Not at all.

But, I do believe
this is the tomb

Behar spent
his life looking for.

Let's get moving, people.

Okay, I'm starting
to feel that we're lost.

We're not lost, Greg.

We're discovering.

Greg. - Yeah?

Keep an eye on Wells.

Yeah.
Yeah?

Okay.
Good.

Carl?

Are you there?

<i>Always.</i>

<i>Until you get that stone,</i>
<i>you're stuck with me.</i>

I wanna show you something.

Something I didn't
share with the others.

<i>I saved all the images</i>
<i>from earlier.</i>

<i>I had a few experts</i>
<i>look them over</i>

<i>and they all agree with you.</i>

<i>About the talisman keeping</i>
<i>Neferu in the tomb.</i>

Yeah, well you didn't get
to see everything earlier.

<i>Are you keeping secrets</i>
<i>from me, Jack?</i>

I didn't think you'd want me sharing
this with the rest of the group.

<i>I, I don't see anything.</i>

'Cause you're not
looking close enough.

The others missed it
in their excitement.

<i>What does it say, Jack?</i>

Talks about a passageway
in the heart of the tomb.

And, and it's unclear.

Can't make it out.

<i>Is it about the Kodek stone?</i>

Yes.

"The talisman,

"placed in the heart cavity
of the cursed king

"to keep him in
perpetual torment."

<i>And, that means...</i>

That means,
we find Neferu's mummy,

we find your goddamn stone.

<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

Your guess is good as mine.

Son of a bitch.

They're taking my laptop, Jack.

Tell them to go.
That equipment is...

Hey!

She will come with us!

Not so fast, asshole.

Jack! -We need that
equipment, Wells.

Fuck your equipment, Cooper.

So much for mentioning
Naseem's name.

I thought you knew him!

<i>I do and I can assure you</i>
<i>that we'll be having words.</i>

Words?

You better have
more than words, Carl.

<i>If I didn't</i>
<i>know you better, Jack,</i>

<i>I'd think you had feelings</i>
<i>for the girl.</i>

Shit! Your little bitch
is quite a handful.

I told you to let her go.

She shot my man!

Can't say I blame her.

Jack, just shoot him.

Shut up.

So, are we gonna tell someone?

What are you doing?

I think it would be wise
if we left camp.

What are you
talking about, Coop?

It's Cooper. Dr. Cooper.

Oh, okay. I'll ask again.

What the fuck do you mean,
Cooper?

Decided we're leaving
and we will return

when things around here
are safer for us

to continue our work.

Unacceptable.
Safer?

Cooper, this is the
Middle East.

When exactly do you think things are
ever gonna be safer around here?

We all discussed it.
It's for the best.

Well, nobody
discussed it with me.

I didn't think it was necessary
to discuss it with you, Wells.

Tell me you are not
okay with this.

Hey, I'm just the hired help.

I follow the money.

Load the rest of the gear
up on the jeep.

Shit.

We're not going anywhere.

Some son of a bitch
just cut the...

What was that?

Hassan!

Wait for us, Wells.

Radio for help.

We don't have time to wait.

<i>Jack, talk to me.</i>

<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>going on there?</i>

Shit!

Kate!

It's not deep.
It looks worse than it is.

Can you stand?

Yeah, I'll be all right.

Dr. Cooper?

Dr. Cooper.

The radios, they...

Slow down, kid.

Try and breathe.

You okay?

The radios and satellite
phones are trashed.

So,

we're fucked.

Shit.

Jack!

What was that?

Oh, my God, get in here!

Oh, my God, Wells!

Dr. Cooper.

<i>Jack.</i>

Dr. Wells.
<i>- Jack... You still there?</i>

Where's Marty?

<i>Jack?</i>

He's over here.

He's trapped.

His hand is stuck.

Looks bad.

Oh, Jesus Christ!
We gotta get him out.

<i>I can have a rescue team</i>
<i>to you in 12 hours.</i>

<i>Just get the stone first.</i>

Let me take a look.

So now you're a medical doctor?

I'm just trying to help.

You know, it's okay to pull
that stick out of your ass

every once in a while, Cooper.

Fine.

This does not look good.

What are we gonna do?

We're gonna get him free,
then we're gonna find Kate.

Kate?

Seems like we have more pressing
issues than finding Kate.

Stop. - What?

You're gonna bring the whole
place down on our heads.

We can't leave Marty.

We're not leaving anyone.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna try to pull him free.

Are you insane?

This whole place is gonna
come down any moment now.

We gotta get you out of here.

Don't.

I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's gonna hurt.

A hell lot of a worse before
it gets any better.

Shit. How bad?

Bad, kid. Pretty fucking bad.

Give me your wallet, Coop.

My wallet? What do you
want with my wallet?

Just give him your
fucking wallet!

I don't give a shit
if he wants a tip.

Just get me
the fuck out of here.

You might wanna
bite down on this.

Why?

It's better than
biting your tongue off.

This is not gonna be fun, kid.

Don't, don't tell me
about it, just do it.

Greg, on three.

You got that, Coop?

One,

two,

three!

Any news on that rescue team?

<i>Any news on my stone?</i>

You'll get your fucking stone
as soon as I know Kate is safe.

But, I wanna know
that team is on its way.

<i>I'll make the call.</i>

<i>Think of it as a</i>
<i>gesture of goodwill.</i>

One of these days, Carl,

I'm gonna kill you.

<i>Join the line, Jack,</i>
<i>join the line.</i>

Is he ready to move?

He's lost a lot of blood.

I know.

But, is he ready?

I'm ready.

Can you stand up?

Yeah.
Okay.

Let's get you up.

What now?

Our options are pretty limited,

but I suggest we get moving.

You know, I said we should
have left.

If we had, we wouldn't
be in this situation.

Yeah, and Marty would still
have two arms.

We can't change that either.

I told them we should've
hired someone else.

Don't try putting this shit
on me, Cooper.

It's okay, buddy, we're
gonna get you out of here.

Your act doesn't fool anyone,
Wells.

What fucking act?

We all know about your past.
Me better than most.

Or have you forgotten about
Abu Rawash?

That has nothing to do
with what's happening here.

You sure about that?

I'm sure the Kodek stone is
a huge temptation for you.

We'll finish this later,
Cooper.

But, right now,
Kate is the priority.

<i>And the stone, Jack.</i>
<i>Don't forget the stone.</i>

Fuck you and fuck your stone.

It all looks the same.

Is there water in that canteen?

Some.

Give it to me.

Stop complaining, Cooper.

Wells, Wells, wait.

We need to rest.

Marty doesn't look very good.

Marty?

So thirsty.

Can't breathe.

How much water you got left?

Why?

It's my water.

Whatever you got,
you give half to Marty.

Get him comfortable.

And, if Cooper holds out
on the water,

you punch him in the face.

I'm gonna scout ahead and see if I
can get some bearings on a way out.

Wait. Hey, wait!

You'll be back, right?

Half an hour, tops.

<i>I was wondering when you</i>
<i>were going to dump</i>

<i>that dead weight.</i>

Well, I might be lying to them,

but I have no intention
of dumping them.

<i>So what's the plan?</i>

I've been walking
them in a circle

for the last 15 minutes.

<i>Why?</i>

Because I saw something that I
wanted to take a closer look at.

<i>What is it, Jack?</i>

It's interesting.

<i>Talk to me, Jack.</i>

It's a coded map.

<i>On where?</i>

<i>- To find the stone?</i>
Yeah.

And how to get the fuck
out of here.

Looks like

you have to go through the
burial chamber

before we'll find

the exit.

Shit.

Shit!

Thank God, it's you.

He's back.

Wells?

Yeah, it's me.

And I brought a friend.

Hey.
Hey.

Tell me you found a way out.

I might've.

You might have?
What the hell does that mean?

I found more writing.

It looks like the slaves planned
an escape at some point.

And they mapped
the structure out in code.

It tells how we must go
through the heart of the tomb,

to reach salvation.

The heart?

I think it's talking about
the burial chamber.

I know what it means, Wells.

Christ, that means we have to
go deeper.

It's the best chance
we've got right now.

Unless you wanna wander
around here aimlessly

until we run out of water.

Shit.

How you doing, kid?

Stopped wanting to vomit.

That's a plus.

You ready to make a move?

Kate has something to show us.

Shortcut to the exit, I hope.

No, but I think I found Behar.

Or at least what's left of him.

Oh, my God.

What happened to him?

Poor guy.

Had to guess, I'd say
Hassan happened to him.

You'll be okay for a minute?

Yeah.

His heart's gone.

Yeah.

Whatever took his heart had
his brain at the same time.

<i>What if he explored the tomb</i>
<i>before he made the video?</i>

<i>He may have the stone.</i>

If this was Hassan's handiwork,

he is one sick bastard.

What are you looking for?

I'm looking for anything
that might help us.

Now, this is more like it.

<i>- The stone?</i>
Dynamite.

What if Behar did enter
the tomb?

What if he had,
it changed nothing.

He'd still be dead,
we'd still be trapped.

What if he found the stone?

What, and Neferu wants it back?

Just listen for a minute,
will you?

What if he found the stone

and Hassan killed him for it?

For a man who has no interest
in the Kodek stone,

you talk about it quite a lot.

That's because our lives
might depend on it.

Canopic jars.

We must be close.

It's an antechamber.

<i>What's going on, Jack?</i>
<i>I'm still blind on this end.</i>

<i>And you haven't spoken</i>
<i>for over an hour.</i>

Careful!

It's empty.

Supposedly, Siptah had
Neferu's organs destroyed,

so he couldn't
take them to the afterlife.

The jars that you are
about to drop...

Were left as a further insult.

Can you feel that?

Feel what?

It's fresh air.

It's faint, but I can feel it.

I feel it.

Fresh air means
a way out, right?

Maybe.

Hey, guys.

Over here.

There's an opening.

There's another chamber
on the far side,

larger than this one.

What about the air?

It's definitely breezy.

Looks safe enough.

It's in and out, Kate.
All you gotta do is breathe.

And you'll be waiting
for me on the other side?

You want me to go first?

You promise to follow?

I'll make sure she does.

And you're okay
bringing up the rear?

It's better I go last.

You don't want me collapsing
halfway through

and blocking up the passage.

Don't even joke
about it, Marty.

Come on, guys!

Just remember, breathe.

Come on, Doc. It's easy.

No more than 30 feet, Kate.

Just keep moving.

<i>What's going on, Jack?</i>

I'm trying to
get out of this mess alive.

<i>What are you doing, Jack?</i>

<i>I mean it, Jack.</i>
<i>No stone, no rescue team.</i>

If I get out of here,

you're gonna need a rescue
team after I hunt you down.

<i>I'm harder to find</i>
<i>than you think.</i>

Rochester Hotel, 336.

You're not the only one
with resources, Carl.

We're almost there, Doc.

Come on!

Okay, Kate.
Just close your eyes.

Feel your way along.
Nothing to it.

That's easy for you to say.

I'm going as fast as I can.

Almost there.

You're full of shit, Jack.

Shit!

Jack?

Come on, Kate, 6 feet!

I can't.

Wells.
Fuck off, Coop.

Kate?

I can't.

Fucking look at me!

Now, follow me.

You still there, Marty?

Get me out of here, Dr. Wells!

Now, I need you to
hold on there, Marty.

I don't wanna be left
down here,

not alone,

not to die.

Don't you even think
about that, Marty.

I'm getting you out of here,

and we're gonna get you
a new arm, you hear me?

I've got a friend whose gonna get
you the best arm money can buy.

His name's Carl.
<i>- Not funny, Jack.</i>

I don't like it down here,
Dr. Wells.

I'm scared.

You call me Dr. Wells again
and I'll stop digging.

The name is Jack.

You call me Jack.

Just get me out of here!

You guys, quiet a minute.

What is it?

I don't know,
didn't you hear it?

Marty? - Did you hear that?

Yeah, we heard it.

I need you to try to get to us,

can you do that, Marty?

Yeah, I'll do my best.

I just wanna go home.

You and me both.

I don't wanna die!

Marty!

Marty!

You see anything?

This fucking coward.

Hassan, you son of a bitch.

I'm not so sure
that was Hassan.

Who else could it have been?

I mean, I lost him in the cave

and we all saw what
he was about to do to Marty.

Yeah, but that doesn't
convince me

that it was Hassan
with Marty this time.

Who was it then, Wells?

Neferu?

Oh, no, go on, tell us.

If it wasn't Hassan,
who was it?

I don't know.

I didn't see it clearly.

But it moved too fast to be...

To be what?

To be human.

That's ridiculous.

Do you see that light?

Oh, shit.

What is it?

I think we just found...

The burial chamber.

It's definitely
not what I expected.

Neferu wasn't treated
as a king.

His brother wanted
death to be an insult.

What are you doing, Wells?

What you brought
me along to do, Coop.

Decipher.

What does it say?

"Neferu's soul
is held within the stone,

"and the stone within,

"Neferu."

What the hell does it mean?

I don't know.

Shh.

Do you guys hear that?

I'll keep my eye out.

So,

you wanna open it?

You ready?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Let's do it.
Okay.

Okay.

Lift.

Oh, fuck.

Where the hell is Neferu?

<i>Did you find the stone?</i>

It's not here.

What's not in here?

The diamond?

I know you're only here
for that stone.

You've been lying to us
the whole time.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Jack?

Is that true?

We're all getting paid
to do a job.

I'm just getting paid twice.

You son of a bitch.

I knew I never should
have brought you along.

If we're gonna get out
of this mess,

we're gonna have to
do it together.

No! Help!

Are you okay?

<i>What the hell is going on,</i>
<i>Jack?</i>

Yeah, good news is,
I found your stone.

Bad news is,
it just walked away.

We gotta get out of here.

You will.

Jack?

Find a way out.

There's rescue team on the way.

What about you?

I'm going back for Cooper.

<i>What about my stone?</i>

I'm coming with you.

Just find the exit.
I'll be right behind you.

Now go.

Go!

<i>What's your plan, Jack?</i>

I haven't got one.

<i>Jack?</i>

<i>What's going on?</i>

<i>Talk to me, Jack.</i>

Please don't do this.

I am sorry.

It is his will.

No!

It is done, My King.

<i>Jack, wake up,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch...</i>

Oh, Jesus Christ.

<i>Shit, Jack,</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear your voice.</i>

You might change your mind,

when I tell you
my fee just went up.

<i>Well, it's a bit late in
the game for negotiating.</i>

Oh, yeah?

Well, I charge extra when
a cursed mummy is involved.

<i>Jack?</i>

<i> Jack?</i>

Dr. Wells,

you should've left
when you had the chance.

Untie me

and I'll leave right now.
No!

It's too late for that.

Neferu must take
what was taken from him.

You help him kill?

His hold on me is too strong.

And with each victim,
he grows stronger.

How many, Hassan?

How many before us?

Not enough to quench
the King's hunger.

Maybe, one day,

he will sleep again.

Until that day comes...

I must serve him.

I wish you safe travels
into the next life.

Doctor...

Kate.

I told you to get out of here.

I bet you're glad
I didn't listen.

We have to get
the fuck out of here

before Neferu comes back.

It must be a trick,

being alive defies any logic.

He's not alive, Kate,

he's hungry.
Shit!

Oh, fuck.

Run!

Shh.

So, where's this way out
you were talking about?

This way.

There it is.

<i>The rescue team should be with
you in the next two hours.</i>

They better be here
in two minutes.

Down, Jack! Duck!

Keep digging.

Whatever happens,
just keep digging.

Time to go nighty night,
asshole.

Jack?

Jack!

The Kodek stone.

Beautiful isn't it?

It's amazing.

Isn't it?

<i>Yes, it's stunning.</i>

Neferu. Do you think
he's still around?

I'm not gonna stick around
to find out.

But, just in case he is...

<i>- What are you doing, Jack?</i>
What are you doing?

Keep it! <i> -You can't do that.</i>

<i>You, you son of a bitch.</i>

<i>You're ruined,</i>

<i>I'm gonna see to it,</i>
<i>Jack Wells.</i>

Fuck you, Carl.

Name.

Carl Rosencane.

Profession.

A little this, a little that.

Do you own ItraCorp Intel,
Mr. Rosencane?

Oh, that's among many
of the things that I own.

I'll take that as a yes.

Take it as you will.

But make this as quick
as possible.

Have you had any dealings
with the Egyptian government

as of late, Mr. Rosencane?

I have many dealings
with many governments.

Would you care to elaborate?

Are you aware of the
disappearance

of an archeological team
outside of Hijaza?

Dr. Jeremy Cooper,

Dr. Jack Wells,

Kate Alvarez, Marty Timor,

Greg Baptiste.

We've been informed that

you may have participated
in their disappearance.

I'd love to know where
you get your information.

Our sources are none of your
concern, Mr. Rosencane.

What is of our concern is the
disappearance of five American citizens

and the involvement
that ItraCorp Intel

might have played
in said disappearance.

ItraCorp Intel is a
legitimate company.

I have nothing to do
with anybody's disappearance.

To believe otherwise
would be absolutely ludicrous.

What would I have to gain?

What do you know about the
Kodek stone, Mr. Rosencane?

Jack, you son of a bitch.

I want my lawyer.

Now, God damn it!
