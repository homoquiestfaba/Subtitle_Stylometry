You all look terrific.

Now, everybody should be
two arms' lengths apart.

Two arms' lengths apart.
Yeah?
Close-up, my man.

The object is to create
works of individual
artistic expression.

Copying is strictly forbidden.

Ahh, here comes
   the guest of honor now.
[ Man ] Here he is.

Salmoneus, I got your message.
It sounded urgent.

What could be more urgent
than the burning fires
of creative inspiration?

What?
King Armand wants a new
centerpiece for his museum.

In exchange,
he'll give a fortune
to the War Orphans' Fund,

minus my small
finder's fee, of course.

Uh, how small?
Fifty dinars.
A pittance!

Financial remuneration
is not always on my mind.

If we can serve these artisans,
put them on the map...

and serve charity
at the same time,
it's all worth it, huh?

And after
they're on the map,
what's your cut?

Uh, 75%.
Yep.

And well earned.
If it weren't for me,

these guys would be painting
cows and pastures the rest
of their anonymous lives.

[ Sighs ]
I said, no copying, Xerox.

[ Copy Machine Whirring ]

[ High-pitched ]
Whoo!
Hmm.

Okay, this is for art
and charity,

so you want me
to be a judge, right?

Uh, that,
and I want you to pose.

You, my friend,
are going to be
a work of art.

I, uh,
 I don't think so. No.

Eh, I did mention charity?
The home for poor war orphans?

[ Sighs ]
Fine.

They'd like you
to take off your shirt.

Uh, it's more, um,
expressionistic,
more herculean.

A-Are you kidding?

No, I-- There's--
There's a draft in here.
I can't--

A draft?
You are Hercules,
aren't you?

No, I can't help.
There's a draft!

Fine. Fine. Fine.

Just a thought.

Why stop with the shirt?

You know,
they say the purest form
of artistic expression...

is the nude human figure.

[ Scoffs ]
Forget it.

Think of those orphans!
You're talking about a draft!

They're sleeping under a roof
that doesn't even exist!

Huh? Come on.
Be a sport.

Be a hero.
Take off your clothes.

Do I at least
get a curtain
to change behind?

Shy, Hercules?
Hey!

[ Chuckling ]
Oh. Look who's here.

Oh, Atalanta!
Hi.

I hardly recognized you
with your thighs covered. Oh.
[ Clears Throat ]

Hercules, Salmoneus,
meet Curteus.

You know Hercules? How?
You said you were
such a homebody.

Homebody? Kid you should've
seen her at the first Olympics.
She took a--

Why, yes.
Just watching was exciting.

Curteus, would you like
some punch?
Here, I'll get it.

Atalanta--
[ Coughs ]

You look more like a schoolmarm
than a female powerhouse,
rippling with sensuous--

Curteus likes
the soft look.

Guess it's easier
to imagine me baking cookies...

than slaving
over a hot forge.

Baking? Well, if you can
throw a meal together as well
as you throw a javelin,

I'm coming over
for dinner.
That was then, this is now.

Hmm?
I've spent my whole life being
competitive in a man's world--

at work, in sports--

and what do I have
to show for it?

[ Together ] Well--
Well, no social life,
that's what.

Guys just think of me
as one of the guys.

So that's why I decided
to change my look.

They're not interested
in the real me.

If you think that, then you've
been meeting the wrong guys.
[ Joining In ] Wrong guys.

Boring.
Artists, "schmartists."

Hey, get a load
of muscle lady
in a dress.

Yeah.
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
Who would've "thunk" it?

A smithy
with a girlie streak.

Make that freak.

Careful your sweetie
don't crush you
when you snuggle.

What do you boys
got against Atalanta
anyhow?

What do you mean,
"boys"?

We had the only
smithy business going
till she came along.

Yeah, with her bleeding heart--
free plowshares for the poor.

[ Man ]
Free plowshares?
What's she thinking?

What's this about?

Oh, no.

Excuse me.
Thirsty?

We'll fix that.
[ Chuckles ]

Here, cool off.

[ Shouting ]

Curteus, what happened?
Sissy-boy slipped.

Uh, why don't you guys
just back off, okay?

What? Another defender
of the helpless maiden?

You don't wanna mess
with me and my clan.

Only three against one?
You really don't wanna
mess with him.

Who says
there's only three of us?
[ Chuckling ]

[ Man ]
Come on.
Don't get bruised.

Thanks.
[ Man #2 ]
Finally, a little action!

[ Chuckling ]
[ Woman ]
He don't look so tough!

I-- I can see the, uh,
family resemblance.

[ Man #3 ]
Let's get him!
[ Grunts ]

-[ Man #4 ] Oh! Oh!
[ Screams ]

[ Shouting ]

Go get in there.

[ Shouting ]

[ Shouting,
  Grunting Continue ]

[ Snickering ]

[ Atalanta ]
Not so fast, sister.

Aaah!

[ Grunting, Gasping ]

Yes!

[ Shouting,
  Grunting Continue ]

Come on.
Now that's what I call
  a work of art.

Hey!

Huh?
[ Shouting ]

Come on. Get up,
you no-good-for-nothing lunk.

You let a woman
do that to--

[ Grunting ]
Hey! Who turned out the sun?

[ Man Narrating ]
This is the story
of a time long ago,

a time of myth and legend,

when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

Only one man dared
to challenge their power--

Hercules.

Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

But wherever
there was evil,

wherever an innocent
would suffer,

there would be... Hercules.

[ Screeching ]
[ Roaring ]

Hail!

Good job.
I'm, uh, sorry you got
swept up into that.

Don't be.
I haven't had
so much fun in a long time.

Atalanta?
Curteus, thanks so much
for sticking up for me.

I never realized
you're so, so--

Surprising?
Athletic?

So... muscular.

I, uh, I-- I gotta go.

Wait!

Forget him.
The kid doesn't appreciate
your womanly, wonderful,

golden gorgeousness
like I do.

He just wasn't
the right one for you.

Oh, and who is?
Uh-hum!

Not you, huh, Hercules?
Atalanta--

I know.
Don't say it--

"We'll always be friends."

[ Grunts ]

Shoo!
[ Clucking ]

Well, I did it again,
Hephaestus.

Stuck my big foot
in my mouth...

and humiliated myself
in front of the world...

and Hercules.

Mmm? No.

Uh, yeah.
Well, these ought to do it.

[ Hercules ]
Well?
Coming right up!

It's about time.
[ Gulps ]

Here you go.
Thank you.

Let's hope they enhance
the artistic symmetry and flow.

Yes.

Mmm? Ooh.

[ Gasps ]
[ Man ]
Inspiration.

[ Woman ]
Look at that!

[ Man #2 ]
I've never seen anything
like it.

Confidence!

Confidence!

Right. Okay.
Now, interpret
what you feel.

Interpret
what you see, hmm?

Each result
should be different.

After this, you're all
gonna be famous, huh?

Salmoneus.
Yeah.

You're slowing them down.
Right.

Now, Hercules,

a little flex!

You're pushing it.

Work always
makes me feel better.

[ Sighing ]

[ Giggling ]

[ Hammer Striking Chisel ]

[ Hammer Striking Metal ]

[ Sizzling ]

[ Smashing ]

[ Hammer Striking Metal ]

All that racket.

What do you think
she's buildin'?

If she's smart,

her coffin.

So, what do you think,
Hephaestus?

Good job, huh?

I always knew
 I had an artistic flair.

Well, if I can't
have Hercules--
[ Chuckles ]

I guess this is
the next best thing.

Forged of fire and steel.

No blood in his veins.

Can't disappoint me.

Can't hurt me.

Can't make me cry.

[ Sighs ]

The perfect man.

We're alike,
you and I.

Maybe it's...
my destiny...

to be a living,
breathing sculpture...

of muscle and flesh,

apart from everyone,

alone forever.

[ Sighs ]

[ Horse Neighing ]

Oh, so,that'swhat
she's been up to--

building
her very own boyfriend!
[ Laughing ]

Here. When she gets back,

we're gonna stick
them muscles of hers...

and see if they burst.

Well, I don't know.

Swillus said let's wait
till Hercules leaves town.

Well, Swillus ain't here,
is he?

Now, get ready!

[ Electrical Surging ]

[ Both Screaming ]

[ Screaming Continues ]

Hmm.

Hercules?

[ Chuckles ]
Hercules?

Hmm.

[ Horse Sputtering ]
Is this a joke?

Hephaestus,
is this your doing?

I asked for the perfect man--

I guess I got him.
[ Grunts ]

Well, maybe not exactly
what I expected.
[ Chuckling ]

Oh, boy,
this is wild.

You sure look like
the real one.

[ Knocking ]
[ Man ]
Atalanta, you here?

I got some horses here
to show you.
Hmm!

I gotta go.
Just stay put.

Stay.

Stay.

[ Chicken Clucking ]
Hmm?

[ Clucking Continues ]

[ Shrieks ]

[ Clucking ]

[ Imitates Clucking ]

[ Sniffing ]

Hmm.

[ Grunts ]

[ Horse Neighs ]

Yolk for the yokel?

How's it taste?
Yummy?
Yummy.

Hmm?

No, thanks.
I already had a hearty
ambrosia breakfast.

I gotta admit.

Old Hephaestus
sure does good work.
Mmm.

You look like Hercules,
all right.

Hmm. Hercules?

No. You're Hercules.

I'm a goddess, dummy.
Discord's the name.
Hmm.

I got me some big
family shoes to fill,

and I just know you're
gonna help me fill 'em,

just as soon
as I unleash you...

on that big, wide world,
that is.

[ Moans ]

[ Horse Neighing ]

[ Gasps ]
Go.

Enjoy.

[ Panting ]

Go on. Attaboy.

Mm-hmm.

[ Man ] At last.
All right, geniuses. It's time
for Hercules to pick a winner!

I-- I'm sure they're
all wonderful, and choosing one
won't be easy.

[ Chuckling ]
[ Man ] I've waited for
this moment all my life.

[ Hercules ] It's an eye.
It's the eye of Hercules.

It's-- It's--
 It's abstract.

It's-- It sends chills
down my spine.

Very incisive, Picassus.
I got naked for an eye.

Uh, what do
you think?

It's not like
what I draw at home,
but I'm sure it's very good.

[ Laughing ]
Moving on.

[ Salmoneus ]
Oh.

Um, forgive me, Davincium,
but i-it looks
a little feminine.

Don't be so literal.
These are artists.

Everything is imaginative.
Everything is
completely original.

Next, Xerox.

Not everything
is completely original.

Moving on.

I call it
The Ponderer.

Yes, you would.
I mean, what else
could you call it?

He ponders.

Next, we have
that fine young renderer
of pop culture,

Warholius.

Words fail.
Hercules, it's gonna be
a tough job,

but you gotta pick a winner.
[ Man ]
There he is! Hercules!

We need your help.
The mine caved in.
Some of the men are trapped.

Salmoneus, this can wait.
Let's go.

No, it can't!
Hercul--
[ Woman ] Hey, where's he going?

Herc, don't-- Whoa--
[ Man ]
Come back.

We're gonna
have a slight delay.

All right.
We're gonna have to
set some ground rules.

For one thing,
hay is for horses, not for--

Hello?

Hello.

Where'd he go?

Oh, great.

[ Grunting ]

[ Footsteps Approaching ]

Hercules!
Ah, thank the gods!

I thought you were still
back at the art fair.

Anyway, I could
use some help.

Help?
Yeah.

All you gotta do is--
is grab and-- and lift,
like this.

Okay.

All right.

I like helping.
Bye.

[ Man ]
Hurry. There you go.
Come on. Help him.

Get him through.
Quick! Come on!

Is that everybody?
That's the last of them!

Thank you, Hercules.
We were lucky
you were on hand to help.

Well, I'm glad
I could be here to--
to help out.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta go judge
an-- an art fair.

I just don't see it.
[ Metallic Clattering ]

Ah, Hercules!
[ Steel Hercules Chuckling ]

[ Chattering ]

Everything turn out okay
at the cave-in?
Hmm?

Of course, it did.
Why ask?

Let's get on
with this thing, huh?

[ Chuckling ]
Artists are so temperamental.

This way.
[ Chuckling ]

You okay?

It's, uh, pretty.

Yeah, pretty.

Uh, Hercules, which one
of these works of art,

"Portraits of a Hero,"
has touched your heart,
stolen your soul?

Excuse me.
I don't think that's--

Honey, stop bothering
the artists, huh?

Go stand over there.
Way over there!

Keep going!

Attagirl!
[ Chuckling ]

Hiya, metalhead.
[ Sniffs ] Hmm?

And they call
these monstrosities art?

I kinda like 'em all.
He likes them all!

Hah! But, unfortunately,
King Armand only wants one.
[ Woman ] He likes them all!

Which one is it
to be, Hercules?

They're all so--
Hideous?

Hideous.
Hercules!

Hmm?

Those things
don't look like you.
They're ugly.

They're making fun
of you.

They're not your friends.
They don't even like you.

They're laughing at you.
Destroy them.

I said, destroy them!

[ Grunting ]

[ Laughing ]

[ Salmoneus ] Hercules,
what are you doing?
They're makin' fun of me!

Oh, no! No! No!
Get out!

[ Giggling ]

[ Salmoneus ]
Everybody's a critic!
[ Whimpering ]

Hey, how you doing?
Good, thanks.

[ Mumbling ]

Making fun of me.

I'll show them.

[ Grunting ]
Hey, watch it!

[ Chuckles ] I'm sorry.
I, uh, guess I wasn't watching
where I was... going.

You look like me.

There you are.
Now, why did you go with--

Um, hi, fellas.

Atalanta,
who is he?

She made me.

Then Hephaestus
brought him to life.

Well, uh, I'm sure
Hephaestus meant well,

but, uh,
this isn't natural.

Nothing good
can come from this.

Will you please
stop doing that?

Would you please
not do that?
[ Chuckles ]

Look, I didn't
ask for him.

Okay, well, maybe I did,
but I didn't realize that--

Anyway, he's here,
and I can't send him back.

So, I'm gonna have to
just make the best of this.

Teach him things.
I want to learn.

Oh, I'll bet you do.
[ Chattering ]

You may not be able
to handle him.
What happened back there?

Looks like he threw
a little tantrum.
No one got hurt.

Yeah, not this time.
I was just trying
to have a little funs.

I'll keep
a closer eye on him.

You're coming with me.
Bye.

Atalanta,
this isn't right.

Hercules, please.

I am a big girl.

I finally found someone
who accepts me for me.

[ Clattering ]
Maybe he's not perfect,
but neither am I.

Can't I just enjoy myself?

[ Salmoneus ]
Oh, Hercules!

[ Sighs ]
Now, some of that stuff may
have been a tad ostentatious,

but don't you think
destroying everything
was a little over-the-top?

Hercules?

Hercules?
"Lerkehoos"?

"Herculoos"?
Hercu--
Come on!

[ Groaning ]
There are two of ya, huh?

I'll explain later.
I may not have a later!
Those guys wanna lynch me!

You're stepping
on my masterpiece!

That's if they don't
kill each other first.

Work's done.
Now, about that dinner
I promised you.

[ Steel Hercules ]
I hope you like mushroom soup.

[ Grunts ]

Ow.
It's my favorite.

How'd you know?

I make it my--
I-- I make it my, uh,

business to know
all about you, Atalanta.

You're more talented
than I thought.

I really wasn't expecting this.

I'd better get cleaned up.
You're perfect.

Oh, you're-- you're--
you're perfect
the way you are.

Am I dreaming?

It's barely been a day
since you were born,
and now this?

I'm a fast learner,
with you to teach me.

I'm a fast learner
with-- with you to teach me.

What did I tell ya?
Miss Lonely Hearts
is eating this right up.

Now, pour the wine.

Not too fast!
Like we practiced.

Remember your line.

You read my mind.

U-Uh, a toast...
to the light
of my life... flow.

Funny, you don't drink.

I mean,
Hercules doesn't drink.

This tastes good.
Careful. Don't blow it.

I do a lot of things
Hercules doesn't do.

I do a lot of things
that Her-Hercules doesn't do.

Hello?
Can we pick up
the pace, please?

Wh-What's your sign?
No, not that!
Not yet!

I beg your pardon?
Be aggressive.
  That's what she really wants.

Ready for dessert?

Whoa! Slow down!
[ Kissing ]

Come on.
You know you want it.

What I want,
I don't hide.

But this is just
all happening too fast.

Mmm, such a tease.
This is weird.

I don't know
who's teaching you
your moves,

but you've got a lot
to learn about romance,
my friend.

What? Talk about
mixed signals!
The prude.

Hercules was right.

This was a big mistake.
Go back to the barn.

Go!

I hate the barn!

Spoilsport.

She's under
a lot of pressure.
Poor thing.

See, there are some bullies
in town that wanna
do a number on her.

What do you mean,
"a number"?

Stomp her. Mess her up.
Squash her like a bug.

They wanna hurt her?
That's not good.

No. A real man...

would defend
his lady's honor.

How? Atalanta will be angry
if I leave this stupid barn.

Ever hear of the expression,
"Whipped"?

I tell ya--
there's another Hercules.

He attacked us
in her barn.

Just as strong,
only dumb as a stump.

[ Scoffs ]
Look who's talking.

Get outta here,
you bums!

Come on.
Let's get outta here.

You don't believe us.
Fine.
[ Burps ]

But it really happened.
It's a burden, having all
the brains in the family.

Well, if it ain't
the big man hisself.

I'm here to defend
my lady's honor.

[ Scoffs ]
What a load of--
[ Bones Cracking ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Thuds ]

[ Man ]
Make way!

[ Chattering ]

What happened?
It's Swillus.

Somebody snapped his neck
like a twig.

Swillus? Sounds like
that Neanderthal
you and Atalanta fought.

He won't be missed.

Probably one of
his own kin did it.

They're always feudin'.
We'll get him.

Come on.

I have a bad feeling
about this.

[ Atalanta ]
There you are.

Look, I'm, uh, sorry
about last night.

Well, that's all right.
Tonight will be even better.

Listen to me.

I am a woman,

and you are... a child.

There can't be
anything between us.

Do you understand?

I defended your honor.

I saved you
from that bully!
You're supposed to be happy!

What are you talking about?
 What bully?

Don't worry.
I fixed him!

He will never
bother you again!

[ Grunts ]

[ Yelling ]

[ Clattering ]
[ Hercules ]
Atalanta!

Are you all right?
He's gone crazy.

No, don't stop him!
Let him get it
out of his system.

He's not hurting anyone.
Unfortunately, somebody
already has been hurt.

I know. I just
found out about it.

[ Clattering ]
[ Chickens Clucking ]

You wait here.

All right, pal,
you and I need to have
a little...

chat.

Hey!

Welcome to the party,
Hercules.

I'm afraid
the guest of honor
cut out early.

Hello, Discord.
Now it's all starting
to make sense to me.

Discord's here?

Guess so.

It's too late.
Your boy toy flew the coop.

No. He can't
control his anger.
He's a menace to everyone.

That's what she's counting on.
I'll be blamed for all
the trouble he causes.

I think our little tin soldier's
had enough time to start
doing some damage.

[ Grunts ]
No!

Aaah!

[ Grunts ]
[ Discord ]
Nice try.

Bye for now.

Come on.
We've gotta find him fast.

We've got them!
We didn't do it!
I tell ya!

We didn't kill our brother!

It must have been
that other Hercules!

He's just as strong
and meaner and come
along and killed--

That's ridiculous!
You're drunk!

Like always!
[ Man ]
  Send him to Tartarus!

No! No! No! Excuse me!
Please! Please! Please!

You're making
a terrible mistake!
They're telling the truth!

Well, at least part of it.
There is another Hercules!

[ Mob Groans ]
How can that be?

Atalanta built a statue!
Hephaestus brought it to life!

What?
But-- But don't worry.
Hercules is handling it.

Everything is
under control.

A killer with
the strength of Hercules!
We gotta get him!

[ Mob Shouting ]
No! No! Don't! Don't!
 No! What? What? Don't!

I'm such an idiot!
If he hurts anyone,
it's all my fault.

Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's Discord who's to blame.

No, I don't deserve
to get let off the hook.

I should have known
this whole situation
was trouble from the start.

There's no way
you could've known that.

I tried to pretend
a lump of steel...

was a person,

someone I could
care about.

And even worse,
I tried to pretend
I was somebody I'm not.

[ Sighs ]
You wanted a friend,
someone to talk to,

someone to share
things with.

There is nothing wrong
with that, right?
Yeah.

I should've listened
when a real friend
tried to set me straight.

Nah. You were confused.
It happens to all of us.

Even you?

Even me.

Let's get him.

A simple art festival.
Helping war orphans.

What could go wrong
with that?
[ Chuckles ]

I guess I found out,
didn't I?

[ Metal Clanking ]
Hey!

Uh-oh.

From the look on that face,
you're not the good one,
are ya?

Not that
you're not good!

Hey, what's a few psychotic,
homicidal tendencies
among friends?

Speaking of friends,
did you know...

that I'm one of
Hercules' best friends?

I mean, the real Hercules.
Are you saying
I'm not real?

Hey! You look
plenty real to me!

[ Metallic Clank ]
Nice tone!

Atalanta sure didn't skimp
on the-- the metal and steel
when she made you!

[ Chuckling ]
Listen.

I-I-I-I'll-- Oh!
I'll tell you what!

You come back
to the art festival,

and I'll guarantee
that you'll win
the grand prize.

How do you
like that, huh?
You talk too much.

Shut up!
Okay. I'm shutting up.

But if anything happens to me,
Hercules is gonna find out,
and you're gonna be sorry.

I'm shutting up now.

[ Screaming ]

[ Yelps ]

Whoa! Whoa!

Put him down.

I was about to.
Don't encourage him!

[ Grunting ]

Aaah!
Ah, oh.

Oh, thank you.

It doesn't have to be
this way.

You're confused. Discord's
been steering you wrong.
Discord wouldn't lie to me!

She's my friend!
No!

[ Grunts ]

Atalanta, I-I'm sorry.
I-- I would never hurt you.

But you almost did.

Let us help you.
[ Mob Shouting ]

Kill him!

There they are!
Get him!

[ Shouting Continues ]

Which one's
the real Hercules?
Who cares? Get 'em both!

No, stop!
No! He's Hercules!

[ Shouting, Indistinct ]

[ Grunts ]

[ Grunting ]

Look out!

[ Man ]
Come on!
Everybody, stick together!

Now, you're coming
with me!
Hey!

Aaah!

He's got Atalanta!

Salmoneus, take care
of these people!

Stop! Stop!
You're hurting me!

Oh, I'm not even
squeezing hard.

If he held you
twice as tight,
you'd like it.

I can't help
how I feel about him.
[ Sighs ]

I don't get it!
[ Grunts ]

We are exactly
the same!

Only on the outside.

On the inside,
you're not even human.

I should have
seen it sooner.

Yeah. We'll see how you feel
about me when he's not
around anymore.

[ Panting ]
[ Grunting ]

Stop fighting me!

Come on!

Stop it!
Get over--

[ Grunts ]
What a man.

Welcome back.
I've been keeping
the home fires burning.

When Hephaestus finds out
how you ruined things,
he'll pound you senseless.

Unfortunately for you,
poor, love-struck Heph is
off chasing after Aphrodite.

Aaah!

Don't you hurt her.

Relax, dim-wad,
and pay attention.

Hercules should be
coming through that door
right about now.

[ Grunting ]

[ Grunting Continues ]

That's it.
Kick him when he's down.

[ Grunts ]

Whoa.
Not bad for a mortal.

It won't happen twice.

[ Shouting, Grunting ]

[ Grunting Continues ]

It's over, Discord.

Go home.
Oh, fine.

I was getting
bored here anyway.

Here's a little something
to remember me by.

Atalanta!

-Look out!
Aaah!

[ Grunting ]

Now's your chance.
Get him!

I've got it.
Help her.

[ Groans ]

[ Coughing ]

Atalanta?

A dress to replace the one
that got ripped to shreds
during the fight.

Thanks, Salmoneus,
but no thanks.

I've learned my lesson.

I like who I am,
and I'm never gonna
hide that again.

I'm glad
to hear that.

In that case, would you pose
for a papyrus pinup
I was thinking about?

I'm thinking
of folding it three ways,

putting it in
the middle of a men's
gentlemen's quarterly scroll.

We attach it
with a caraway seed
to your navel--

Well, hello there.
I drew you, Hercules.

Let's have a look.

[ Gasps ]

Salmoneus, I think
we found a winner...

from the art fair.
