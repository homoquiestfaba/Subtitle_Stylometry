Bets around, bets around.
Let's go, Jameson.

Everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?

Oh, come on, man, let's go.

No, man, your sister
didn't send me that check yet.

No, this is how you play the...
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

You just told us how to play it!

This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking...

Four of a kind.
What do you got, Melvin?

Yo, Melvin, man,
what you gonna do,

you gonna play the cards
or you gonna hatch them?

I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to
run out to the ATM real quick.

There's gotta be a...

Gotta be a 7-Eleven
out there somewhere.

Let me get two.

So why don't we just go directly in.

Right up this route, straight in.

Yes, well, I see the captain
enjoys the road less traveled.

No, the captain enjoys
not going down the highway,

dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick
and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

It's very bad here.

It's bad here, it's still bad here.

And I've heard it's bad
right down here.

Bad everywhere, huh?
Yeah.

Mines?

Tricky. Swedish-made.

The man didn't say anything
about mines to me.

Sergeant Shaw.

Sergeant.
Sir.

Rolling in two minutes.

Yes, sir.

You okay?

Yes, sir.

Two minutes.

Yo, give me two cards, man.

Captain says we're moving out.

So...

Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.

It was just before Desert Storm.

We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

assessing enemy troop strength

for what Saddam Hussein promised
would be the mother of all wars.

I'm in the lead vehicle
with Sergeant Shaw

and our guide, a civilian contractor.

The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

Ambush!

Hang on.

Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!

Get a flare up, sergeant.

Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!

Covering, covering, covering!

Bear right!

Move it, move it, move it!

Captain Marco!

Sir?

Was you scared?

Scared? Well...

...there was really no time
to be scared.

With complete disregard
for his own life,

Sergeant Raymond Shaw
engaged single-handedly

an entire company of the enemy.

Sergeant Shaw was awarded
the Medal of Honor.

I signed the recommendation myself.

Yes, sir.

Were you wounded?

I was, I was injured.

Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

Major?

Yes.
Did your unit sustain any casualties?

Yes. PFC Edward Ingram,

PFC Robert Baker III
were killed.

Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor,

is the highest award that any soldier
could aspire to.

What these brave men
that I've talked about today did

should never be forgotten.

Since 1917, there have only been
970 Medals awarded,

out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.

Who knows.

Maybe one day,
one of you fine young men

will earn that medal
in defense of this great nation.

Yes.

Major Marco,
on behalf of Troops 1094 and 1128,

just wanna thank you

for coming to speak to us
about the Medal of Honor

and about your interesting experiences
in the armed forces.

Thanks for listening.

Thank you very much.

You ever wish it had been you?

I'm sorry, excuse me?

Won the Medal.

Been... Been the hero.

Well, sir, I'm just...
I'm just proud that I was there.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Major Marco?
Yes.

Al Melvin, sir.

Corporal Melvin.

From your unit, Desert Storm.

Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

I have these dreams, sir.

Dreams?
Yes, sir.

Kuwait. It's you and me,

Ingram and Baker and...

...Raymond Shaw.

Okay.

See, I remember it happened
like you just said,

and then...

...I don't.

Well...

...we had it pretty rough
over there, Melvin.

That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.

Do you have dreams, sir?

Everybody has dreams, corporal.

No, not these.

No, I don't.

I write it all down.
You know, like, every night,

right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.

It doesn't always come together,
you know,

not everything that I can remember.

Maybe you should go
to the V.A. Hospital,

talk to one of the doctors.

I've been to doctors, man.
Okay.

I'm just... I'm just...

I'm just a little stuck, sir.

Because I remember, okay, Shaw...

Shaw, okay...
Shaw saving us, right...

...but that doesn't make sense,
because...

...that should've been you.

Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...

...the Toyota is here...

All right. Just get up, get up.

Listen, it's...

That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.

What I was hoping is that,
you know, maybe...

You need some money
or something?

No, no, sir.
Wait a minute.

I don't need your money, man.

All right. It was great to see you.

Paper or plastic, sir?

With public anxiety being rekindled
by the events of Bloody Friday,

with the war on terror continuing into
yet another year, no end in sight,

the worries just continue to grow.

Polls indicate that
more and more voters

are concerned with
personal family safety,

with economic security,

fearing more and more jobs
going overseas

or being taken by
illegal immigrants.

They're concerned with the quality
of air and our water,

the degradation caused by the
rollback in environmental regulations,

by religious and racial polarization,

with the drumbeat of body bags
coming from all over the globe.

The American people are ready
for a new agenda.

But because this party is so
divided on so many issues,

the choice of a vice presidential
nominee may very well be

the unifying factor for delegates
at this convention.

And if this respect propels me
toward the nomination

as your vice presidential candidate,
I will be greatly honored.

We need to look inward,
attend to our own house.

The danger to our country is not only
from some terrorists at large,

terrorists who, by the way,
we've helped engender

with 20 years
of failed foreign policy.

No, the real danger
is from suspending civil liberties,

gutting the Bill of Rights,
allowing our fear

to destroy our democratic ideals,

because once we start overturning
our constitutional protections,

our enemies have won.

Raymond?

There he is.
Darling.

What, were you gonna make me
stand out there like room service?

I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,
your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

she said you were up here
practicing your speech.

I don't honestly understand why

you insist upon
isolating yourself, Raymond.

People adore you,
they crave your company,

and yet here you are,

holed up as if you were some sort of

emotionally challenged individual
like your father.

Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

handsome, intelligent,

people-loving war hero
with a great deal to offer his party.

No.
And his country.

No.

No, what?
No.

I haven't even asked you
a question yet.

No to the question
you're going to ask.

No to all of the questions
you pretend to want to ask.

Your hair is too flat.

And no, you may not engage
in your usual backdoor

And that tie...

political thuggery to shovel me
onto the presidential ticket.

Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

Oh, you're not interested.

Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

But not if it means attacking
the reputation

of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

which I am sure
was part of your plan.

Excuse me, when have I ever
attacked Senator Jordan, despite...

Despite what?

Despite the shameful way
his daughter toyed with you

that summer at the shore.

You chased her away, Mother,
let's not have any illusions about...

She wasn't in your league, but if that's
the way you choose to remember it...

You destroyed any possibility
of us ever...

Honey, you are oversimplifying things
a little bit, but it's okay.

I'll stay out of it.

You have my word.

Thank you. Thank you.

I think you all know my mother,
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

And some of you, no doubt,
remember my father,

the late Senator John Shaw.

I've been honored to serve
my two terms in Congress.

But I also grew up on the Hill.

I've seen how the game is played
by professionals,

how deals are struck,

committees bullied,
agendas bought and sold.

And with apologies to my mother,
I wish to remain an amateur.

I believe democracy
is not negotiable.

I believe that freedom from fear
in the world at large and here at home

is not negotiable.

I know how much Americans
have to fear today.

But I can tell you
that I've been there.

I've faced the enemy firsthand
on the battlefront.

I know what it is to be afraid.

But I am living proof
that we can win.

We can prevail.

We must secure tomorrow today.
Thank you.

Bluffing?
That was the inference.

They should be down on their fat,
white knees, thanking me

for saving this party from
committing political seppuku.

You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, senator.

No. I gave them one opportunity and
that was unusually generous of me.

See if you can get a hold of
Bob Arthur,

because I'm gonna wanna
meet with him.

Thank you very much
for arranging this.

I appreciate it.
Sure.

Mr. Secretary.
Senator.

Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

Good to see you again.
Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

Buddy. Gentlemen.

No, I thought we settled it
this morning.

All right, I'll keep you posted.

The decision is final.

Thank you very much.

How's Jeanine?
Senator.

Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

Now, we don't need your blessing,

but we'd like it.

Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just...

I'm dying to know...

...which genius hatched the idea of
pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

with a relic who thinks that keeping
suicide bombers off our buses

is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?

All the research indicates
that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

sits quite well
with the American people.

"Sits quite well"
translates into how many votes?

Your son is largely unknown
outside of New York.

I mean, his public service,
his congressional record,

while commendable,
is not the kind of thing...

My son is a war hero.

Governor Arthur has agreed
to consider Raymond

for a cabinet-level post.

We didn't come here
to have a discussion.

Did we come here
to have a discussion?

Ellie, you don't have the votes
to block this.

Not even to push the nomination
to a second ballot.

Oh, Jim, even running against
this cut-and-fold vice president,

with his party's record of
abysmal failure at home and abroad,

Governor Arthur is still unelectable
to the presidency...

...without help.

Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

can hold on to his own home ground,
and the Northeast,

and even California,
we are still dead across the South.

He's not dead completely
in the South, senator...

And the Southwest,
where they win by landslides.

I mean, you know this.

Your focus groups,
your polls all tell you this.

They back me up, right?

Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get

the black vote, women
and college kids.

My gut instinct says he won't,

and on Arthur to somehow hold
the center, where he is soft at best.

We're confident
this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

Five points?

Three?

I can swing that, and you know it.

Oh, I could swing seven
away from you.

That's more than enough
to split the ticket.

And deny us the White House
another four years? No.

No, not even you.

Not even you, senator,
will do that, you are bluffing.

Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will

and I will do whatever is necessary
to protect America

from anyone who opposes her.

I can't...
Am I the only person in this room

who's been reading
these NSA reports?

I've read them.
All right, then you know,

you know we are on the brink
of another cataclysm,

probably nuclear, on our own soil.

Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

And it's not from random terrorists,

but from covert alliances
of disaffected nations

who have all been made bold
by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

who believes that human beings
are essentially good

and that our power is somehow,
I don't know,

shameful or evil or never to be used.

Make no mistake,
the American people are terrified.

They know something's coming.
They can feel it.

And we can either shovel them
the same old shit and call it sugar

or we can arm them.

We can arm them with a young,
vibrant vice president.

We can give them heat, energy,
give them a war hero with heart,

forged by enemy fire
in the desert in the dark,

when American lives
hung in the balance.

Give us a few minutes.

Thank you.

Mr. Secretary,
thank you for your time.

Thank you.
Really appreciate it.

Leona, good evening.
Thank you, Ellie.

Well, they're gonna have to make
their own decisions.

I am proud...

...to offer into nomination

the name of the next vice president
of these United States:

Raymond Shaw!

A remarkable development.
Twenty-four hours ago,

New York Congressman
Raymond Prentiss Shaw

wasn't even being mentioned
as a possible candidate

for the vice presidential nomination
four years from now,

much less this current convention.

Some incredible news
from the convention floor tonight.

Like a long shot
catching the favorite

on the back stretch
of the Kentucky Derby,

Raymond Shaw has overtaken
Senator Thomas Jordan

to gain the vice presidential
nomination.

Raymond Shaw bears the lineage
of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.

Grandson of legendary industrialist
and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,

son of controversial
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,

who took over the seat
vacated by her husband,

the esteemed John Shaw,

when he died tragically
over 20 years ago.

For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw
is an enigma.

The millionaire
Harvard honors student

who enlisted in the infantry,

refusing the officer's commission
to which he was entitled.

Media-shy and reclusive,

Raymond Shaw's life
was forever changed

on the killing fields of Kuwait,

where he won the Congressional
Medal of Honor for combat bravery.

Two members of Sergeant Shaw's
famed "Lost Patrol,"

PFC Edward Ingram

and PFC Robert Baker III,
were killed.

Their guide, a civilian contractor,
disappeared in the ambush.

But Sergeant Shaw
heroically fought off the enemy

and guided the shell-shocked
survivors of the Lost Patrol

across hostile terrain to safety.

Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

Most selfless human being
I've ever known.

The celebrated war hero,

who dedicated himself to
public service after Desert Storm.

The Medal of Honor winner, beloved
by the men of the Lost Patrol.

He quickly turned his energies
to public service

in his adopted state of New York.

The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

which has literally transformed...

Captain Marco!

The revolutionary science
of biogenetics.

The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

which has literally transformed...

Captain Marco!
Raymond Shaw is the most selfless

human being I've ever known.

Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

Yet note the complexity
of the frontal lobe.

Nevertheless...

Captain.

Help me.

Sergeant Shaw.

Captain.

Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.

Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest,

most selfless human being
I've ever known.

Raymond Shaw...

Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.

Good, good, Raymond.

Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest,

warmest, most selfless
human being I've ever known.

No offense, major...

...but it sort of chaps my ass
that we have to have a babysitter.

I'm just here to make sure
you don't get cornered

by some Air Force general's
unhappy wife.

Major Marco,
we should be so lucky.

So nice to meet you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

Raymond Shaw.

Major Marco, this army of two

are gonna do some recon
at the no-host bar.

A failed foreign policy which has
only served to galvanize our enemies.

Excuse me, please.

In fact, mobilizing an ersatz
army of malcontents...

General Sloan, you lead the charge.
Absolutely.

William. Hi, how are you?

All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?

Hello, how are you?
Hello, Bob Arthur.

I mean, isn't that supposed to be
the point of this great country of ours,

that everybody matters.

Not just the people at this party.

But perhaps more importantly,
those who can't afford to be here.

Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me.

Bob. You know my daughter.
Tom, I can't believe it.

Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.

Mark.
Eleanor.

Raymond, your granddad would be
so goddamn proud of you.

Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,
from Manchurian Global.

Hi. How are you?
Pleasure.

And David Donovan,
their managing director.

And co-chair of
the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

Strong supporters, congressman.

They're desperate to be
of service to you, darling.

Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.

Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

So, gentlemen, how's business?

Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.

It could always be better.

Any better and you guys
are gonna have

more assets than
the European Union.

Don't we already?

Every great society,
every great civilization,

always anchored by a great navy.

Congressman Shaw.
Thanks very much.

Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.

Congressman.

Ben Marco.

I know. Hello, captain.

How you doing?

I need to talk to you.
Okay.

Oh, my God, Raymond,
it's been so many years.

And?
And I've been married,

I've been divorced.
Yeah.

Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.

No. No, that's not...
No, yes, I have noticed.

I see. It's great.
Congratulations.

My feelings haven't, though.

Changed, I mean.

What feelings? What?

Jocelyn, I have never
stopped wondering

how things might have turned out
between us

if my mother hadn't...
Raymond.

Raymond, people can't just
rewrite their lives.

I haven't had a relationship...

...of any consequence
since we stopped seeing each other.

Doesn't that say something to you?

Yeah, that...

That you must be just about
the loneliest person on this earth.

Raymond, we were kids then. It must
have been, what, 15 years ago?

It was sweet, but...

Joce.

Yeah. I have to go.

Yeah.

Best of luck with the campaign.

Thank you.

Joce...

Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

I wanna talk to you too.

Not now.
Excuse me, sir.

I mean, I know you're busy,
congressman...

Don't touch me.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, it's just that, well...

Don't ever touch me.

Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?

I'm told it rules.

What were you hoping
Congressman Shaw would say?

I don't know, sir.

It's not so much what he said
or didn't say, it was more of his...

...attitude, his demeanor.

Are you taking your meds?

Lieutenant Colonel Howard,
with all due respect,

I've had over a dozen years
of experts telling me

that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder

and every other mood disorder
that you can name.

In those 12 years,
I've been a good soldier.

And I've denied what
every nerve ending in my body

is telling me is more real than not.

I've had one dream,
not variations on a dream,

the same dream.
Night after night...

No. No. I'm sorry.

You're saying that an entire squad
of U.S. Army soldiers

was hypnotized into believing
that Raymond Shaw

deserved the Medal of Honor.

And that somehow,
thanks to your dream,

you're the only one
who knows the truth.

Major Marco, you will stay clear
of Congressman Shaw.

And you are to resume
your medication.

That is an order.

That will be all, major.

Somewhere right now, an
American soldier in the war on terror

is worried about his
family back home.

Somewhere right now,
in some small American town,

his grandmother is standing
in her kitchen.

She's got her medicine bottle
in one hand,

she's opening the refrigerator
with the other and she's thinking:

"I can pay for my medicine...

...or I can pay for my dinner.

I can't do both."

I don't believe that our mothers
and grandmothers

should have to face that kind of
decision, not in this country.

I don't believe that the brave men
and women of our armed forces,

risking their lives overseas,
should have to worry

about their families back here
in America.

You see, there are some gaps
in this country...

...deep chasms
that we need to bridge.

The gap between rich and poor,

between government
and the people,

between true security
and the notion of feeling safe.

Second floor, room three,
end of hall.

Between what is real...

Don't you just love this guy?

And what is not.

Tough choices are an unavoidable
element of leadership,

I would just urge the governor
to remember that

the primary responsibility
of government...

Al Melvin.

Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?

Fox is in the henhouse.

Weasel.

Weasel is...

The weasel is a weasel.

Sir, I'll be right outside.

What?

I'll be right outside, sir.

I know.

Good night.
Good night, sir.

Shall I get that for you, sir?
No.

Good night, sir.
Good night.

You have 30 seconds, Mother.

Am I that predictable?

You have no idea.

I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.

I thought you were
magnificent tonight.

And so did all the network
campaign experts.

And that compassionate
vigilance thing

is working quite well for you.

I might have to convert.
I happen to believe in it.

Oh, yes, of course you do.

Now, Raymond...
Good night, Mother.

Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.

Hang on a second.
What? Raymond?

Are you there?

Yes?

Sergeant Shaw?

Who is this?

Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
Yes.

Raymond Prentiss Shaw?

Yes.

Listen.

Go to the bedroom of your suite.

Enter the hallway there.

Go to the end and open the closet.

Yes, thank you.

Hello, Raymond.
Hello.

Do you remember me?

No, sir, I don't.

Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes
for our little checkup

from the neck up, gentlemen,
so if we could take his jacket.

Please sit down.

No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...
The Army's got me gathering

information on stress disorders,
so I'm just...

...you know, just running statistics,
trying to find out about my old team...

Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

when Nathan came home,
was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

I mean, did he have nightmares
or bad dreams

about the firefight over there?

You'll feel a little cold
as this anesthetic gel goes on.

Probe sheath...

...and probe.

Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?

Yes, sir.

Now, Raymond, I am going to drill
a tiny hole in the skull,

which will allow delivery
of the new implant.

So, what you'll feel is a little
discomfort in the form of pressure

and also a loud vibrating noise
in your head,

all of which, of course,
is completely normal.

Thank you.

Of course, as soon as this
or any task is completed,

you will already have forgotten
that it ever actually took place.

Probe going in now.

Good.

Excellent.

Releasing implant.

There. That wasn't so bad,
was it, Raymond?

No, sir.

That's good. No decay, no slippage.

Everything seems to be
in flawless working condition.

Now, Raymond.

Can you remember the deaths
of Private Baker and Private Ingram?

Yes, sir.

Good. Can you describe them
for me, please?

We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

assessing troop strength.

"We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

assessing troop strength."

The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back...

"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars..."

The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

The patrol is ambushed.

We're engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support.

RPG incoming, mortar fire.

"Captain..."

Captain Marco
is knocked unconscious.

In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

Baker goes after him.

An incoming mortar shell
kills them both instantly

before I am able to locate and
eliminate the source of the ordnance.

Captain. Captain Marco.

Help me.

Pardon me. Is this seat taken?

I see the captain enjoys
the road less traveled.

Paper or plastic?

Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.

You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.

"Paper or plastic, sir?"

I see you there all the time.

Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

So anyway, I'm on vacation.

Holiday in the Big Apple
and all of that.

And I saw you sitting here
and I said, "Hey,

why not reach out
and touch someone?"

So, what, I suppose
you're heading to New York City.

Yeah, yeah, I'm... Yeah.

Business? Pleasure? Both?

Well, I'm just... I got an old friend
up there, an old Army friend that...

Well, he's in politics now
and I'm just gonna

catch up on old times with him.

I'm sorry, you said your name was...?

Eugenie.

What do your friends call you?

My friends, they call me Rosie.

Rosie?
Yeah, see, my full name is

Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.

Eugenie is, well...

...fragile.

Yeah, but still, when I asked you
your name, you didn't say...

What did you say?
You said Eugenie.

Yeah, well...

...maybe I was feeling fragile
at the time.

Are you okay?

Excuse me.

Hello, captain.

Do you remember me?

Ben.

Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?

No, I'm okay.

Okay. So your friend's
gonna meet you here, then?

No.

All right.

El Dorado 59970.

It's my cell phone number,
in case you ever... You know.

I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

Can you remember or should I write it
on your chest with a Sharpie?

I'll remember.
Okay.

Hey, you're kind of...

You need somewhere to go
to freshen up?

Pentagon watchdogs
today accused

the private equity fund
Manchurian Global

of grossly overpricing plasma
and other critical medical supplies

during the recent
Indonesian incursion,

even as the company secured
a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract

to provide combat support services
to American soldiers

preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.

There you go.

Come on in.

This is my cousin's apartment.

Is she here?
No.

Be it ever so humble.

No place like home, right?

Believe it or not, there's a view.

Go to the fire escape
and tilt your head up,

you can almost see a tree.

Can I get you something to drink?
No, I'm fine.

I've got some dieter's tea.

It's great for your metabolism,
if you're into that.

Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

Or...

...some water?

No, thank you.
I'm sorry.

I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.

Where is she, your cousin?

She's on tour with Dreamgirls.

Hey, are you okay?

Yeah.

Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

You don't have to apologize to me.

I'll make you some tea.

Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

You okay in there?
Yeah, I'm fine.

You know, I left you some towels
in there, did you see them?

What was that?
Dropped my bag.

Ben?

Are you okay in there?

Earth to Ben.

Yeah.

You sure everything's all right?
Yes.

Ben?

Ben?

Ben?

Ben.

Ben?

What are you doing?

Did you see that?

What I had in my hand.

I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.
I held it in my hand.

That's what they all say, Marco.

Some wicked shit got sprayed
on you guys during Desert Storm.

Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.

I personally know of
a couple of Rangers

who swear that they see only
in tertiary colors now,

Delp.
And can pick up sports talk radio

in their cortical block if they get
too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

The Army did try this
tiny, implantable ID thing.

You could imbed it under the skin,
then scan it like a bar code

for medical emergency information:

Blood type, DNA.

Well, the Army never put one in me.

That you know of, man.

That you know of.

U.S. Planes bombed selected sites
in Guinea today, acting on intelligence

that the African nation's military
regime had secretly resumed

its chemical weapons program.

The secretary of defense declined
to comment on the attack,

saying only that the mission
was successful,

targets acquired, that all American
personnel involved here

were home safe and sound.
Striking transportation workers...

My dreams seem more real to me

than what I actually remember
happening over there. It's like...

It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and...

I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

We have all been
brainwashed, Marco.

As for somebody
imbedding electric probes

and computer chips in your brain
to make you do things,

it's horseshit, man.

A little electroshock...

...and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price.

Ask the Uzbeks.

What about my dreams?

What if all this is your dream...

...and you are really
still back in Kuwait?

Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
Congressman!

Congressman!
Congressman!

Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur

oppose deploying troops
into Indonesia?

Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

we can't clean up the world
with dirty hands.

Sergeant Shaw!

Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

Captain Marco.

It's okay. It's okay.

Nice to see you, sir.

Good evening.
It's good to see you too.

Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.

Thank you, Lily.
Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

They wanna know if you can do
an interview with Larry King at 6?

No, no.
No to the interview or no to 6?

No. He wants to talk
about my mother. No.

Everything under control, P.J.?
Hello, sir.

Good to see you.

So, captain, what can I do for you?

I just need a few minutes
of your time.

Congressman Shaw,
a moment, please?

Private time.

Unfortunately, this is as private
as it gets for me now.

I understand.
He's all right, Will.

Come on in.
Thank you, thank you.

Hey, George.
There are these dreams

that some of the men
from our unit have been having.

Including you?

Well...

...it's more of a question
of what actually happened

the night that our patrol
got attacked.

That's easy. We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain.

The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

You're knocked...
Unconscious. Exactly the way...

Not to cut you off, but I mean,
exactly the way that I remember it.

But I dreamed something else.

Am I in your dreams, captain?

Yes, you are, congressman.

Saving everybody?

It's a whole lot more complicated
than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

he's been drawing these pictures
and he wrote down what he dreams.

Maybe if you just...
I don't have dreams, captain.

At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean...

Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would,

but I think you ought to
see somebody.

Somebody who specializes in...
I've been to doctors.

Well, good, that's very good,

because they can probably
help you out a lot more than I can.

I don't know, but...
Take care, captain.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Thanks for coming by.

I'm not crazy, Shaw.

Major.

Ben. Are you hungry?
Starving.

Well, it depends on the demographic.

Excuse me.

I killed Baker?
Well, it's a dream.

I mean, it could mean
something else.

It could mean I'm supposed
to think you did.

No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so...

...it was okay.

And anyway, I remember what we did
in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

I just...

...don't remember actually doing it.

Maybe you didn't do it.

No.

What a thought.

What?

Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

Which part?

I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.

This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.

I mean, posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet,

shaking hands with total strangers
who must be completely blind

if they can't see
what I am at the core.

What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.

Ferociously a Prentiss.

But not a Shaw. No, sir.
I see.

But not a Shaw. No, sir.
I see.

No, you don't.

You can't.

I was 20 years old
before I had a friend.

Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,
from my point of view, anyway.

A friend outside of my mother's circle
of approved encounters

and she...

...my mother...

God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.

Precipitating my sole act
of rebellion:

Storming off...

...and enlisting in the Army.

But after the war...

...I came back to her.

Why did you come back?
What happened?

Weren't you listening?

Mother happened.

You know, the truth is I hate it.

I've always despised the Medal.

The cloying adulation
of the little people.

It's certainly...

...nothing for you
to be jealous of, major.

I'm not jealous.

I don't have the dreams, Ben.

How could you not remember
saving our unit?

I do. I said I did.

No, no, you didn't. You said
that you didn't remember doing it.

That's what you just said
a couple minutes ago.

When I think about that night...

...it's as if I know what will happen.

The thing is, I never seem
to get to the point

where I feel that it actually
does happen.

But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

Okay. Well, have you discussed this
with anyone? These discrepancies?

Who would I share that with?

My old Army buddies
who love and adore me

for saving their
pathetically unimportant,

present company excluded, asses?

You could discuss it
with Army intelligence.

You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you

and discuss it and you can tell them
what you remember,

what you don't remember,
and they could...

...run some tests.

Yeah, tests. Boy.

The press would have
a field day with that.

Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.

I've got the hole in my back
if you wanna take a look at it.

And I got a good feeling
they put one in you too.

Nobody has put anything
in me, Ben.

Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know...

We'll go get an x-ray...
Look, Ben,

I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

But don't you think this could wait
till after the election?

Why? For what?

What are you scared of?
I'm not afraid of anything.

Then why don't we just prove it...
Know what? I think you should leave.

I'm sorry, I really...
Listen.

Somebody got into our heads
with big steel-toe boots,

cable cutters and a chainsaw
and they went to town.

Neurons got... Got...
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

Our brain cells got
obliterated, Raymond.

Please.

You need to get help, Ben.

What are you doing? Ben!

Stop! Stop!

Inside! Inside!

Congressman!

He bit him. He bit him.

Get him out of here.

Are you okay, sir?

Leave me alone.
Sir, we should...

Get out!

We fished him out of
the Potomac River

about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

What were you doing
in Al Melvin's apartment?

I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.

Talk about what? Dreams?

Interesting stuff.

Yeah, there's hundreds
of those in his place.

You should have your people
check it out.

Oh, we'll get on that right away.

Colonel Garret was kind enough
to show us the file on you, Marco.

You are the real deal, aren't you?

Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

to ask him some
unanswered questions about...

...our reconnaissance
in Kuwait back in '91.

He wasn't home.
Right. He wasn't there.

So, what, you thought it was okay
to just break in and wait for him?

I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're headed.

Nobody said you did.

Maybe he committed suicide.

What's your obsession
with Raymond Shaw?

I'm not obsessed
with Raymond Shaw.

The man of his dreams.

You may want to ask
your medical examiners

to check Melvin's back.

It's under the skin
just shy of the scapula.

They may find an implant.

Just under the skin, left side.

If they don't look real hard,
they won't find it.

They could sing that while
they're looking for it if they like.

Implants.
That's what I said.

I-M-plant.

Yeah, but judging from
your file here, apparently,

you don't know your shit
from your oatmeal, my friend.

Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

You got a problem?

Psycho? You look a little angry.

Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.

Hey!
For God's sake, Ben...

He hit me.

And you wanna help him?

No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.

I want you to help him.

I can't even imagine why.

Mother, I can assure you, I am as
uncomfortable asking you to do this

as you are being asked.

My campaign people are getting
a restraining order against him.

He's going on every security watch list,
but I won't lock him up.

I'm not pressing charges.
What?

I don't know, it's just...

I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

Can we get back to the campaign
and focus on something...

Raymond, you don't actually
believe his story?

No.

But he does.

And he's a fine soldier.

And if his slim hold
on sanity requires

that I tolerate his delusions
until he can get help, I'll do it.

It doesn't diminish me.

I'm not afraid of him.

Raymond.

How much do you actually know
about your friend?

Oh, that's sad.

Poor little tin soldier.

Mother, please.

Well, just imagine how terrified
your people were yesterday

when Major Marco showed up
at campaign headquarters

and you invite...

My God, you invited him in.

With all they know about him.

I know him.

I served under him.
He was a good man.

Well, that's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.
