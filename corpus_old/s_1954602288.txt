MALE <i>NEWSCASTER:
There is great anticipation</i>

<i>in the run-up to
Iran's presidential election</i>

<i>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
the hardline incumbent,</i>

<i>is no longer
the guaranteed victor.</i>

<i>His opponent, the more moderate</i>

<i>Mir-Hussein Mousavi,
has been gaining quickly</i>

<i>and could be poised
for an historic upset.</i>

<i>But Ahmadinejad's student
organizer Alireza Abkar</i>

<i>still believes.</i>

<i>So-called Western
democracy is corrupt</i>

<i>because it reflects
only the will of the people.</i>

<i>Why the Iranian state
is superior?</i>

<i>Well, where do I begin?</i>

<i>We have</i> a <i>big, huge backing
of Ali Khamenei,</i>

<i>and he supports
Ahmadinejad's motives.</i>

<i>He understands
it's an Islamic state,</i>

<i>not a corrupt,
Westernized environment</i>

<i>which Mousavi would like.</i>

Kids today.

Right?

I'd love for you
to reconnect with him

now that the elections
are upon us.

You think he'll still
want to talk?

Yes, I mean, if I bring
him some Maltesers,

he will talk.

Allah is no match
for London chocolates.


It's not funny.

I'm sorry?

It's pathetic.

Ahmadinejad or whoever,

they take these
poor street kids,

who've got nothing,

give them food
or sweets or whatever.

Indoctrinate them
to spout this gibberish.

It's pathetic,
and that's the real story

we should be doing.

He's from here.

Sorry?

Alireza, he's from here.

He's an Iranian Brit.

He was born and raised here.
He's educated.

He doesn't need the chocolates.

He just misses them.

Well, off we go.

Yeah.

Let's go.

Thanks, Bobby.

Uh, may I ask,

Or perhaps pleasure's

No, I'm a journalist

I'm covering the elections

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

And I'm also
visiting my mother.

Uh, I meant no disrespect.
No problem.

DAVOOD: I think
Mousavi is honest.

MAZIAR: Well,
maybe he's not.

<i>Tell Newsweek,
tell the whole world,</i>

if Mousavi fails us,

it's okay, we will find
someone who won't.

MAZIAR: I see you're in
the satellite business.

Sir, satellite dishes
are illegal

and I shouldn't have
to remind you

we live in a lawful

Do you need one?

No problem.

Uh, Davood,
turn that off, please.


So tell me,

there's recently been
a lot of talk about

Mousavi's strength.

Is it something
that surprises you?

Is it something you expected?

Mousavi is, uh, corrupt

Like many of the founders,

<i>he has forgotten the
lessons of the revolution.</i>

It is easy
to fall off the path.

But he has
his supporters, right?


some dead-enders.

MAZIAR: Well, Mousavi
says that Ahmadinejad

is not his main concern
in the election

but the election itself.

They think that the vote
might be rigged.

That there might be
some manipulation...


Oh, people in the street.
Journalists, clerics...

Please, stop.

This is all nonsense.

Rumors and lies

that enemies of Iran
would like us to believe.

To weaken us.

I'm surprised, Mr. Bahari,

that a sophisticated person
would fall for this.

What about an
unsophisticated person?

Hmm.

Ahmadinejad is devoted
to the Supreme Leader.

You see, we are not
a nation, Mr. Bahari,

we are the Ummah,
the Islamic nation.

We obey the commands
of the Supreme Leader,

and the Supreme Leader
determines all.

Ahmadinejad understands this,

Mousavi does not.

Ahmadinejad is what must be.

And are you going
to watch the debate tonight?

We'll have it on,
but, uh, as I said,

there is still much to be done.

Good.

DAVOOD: "This is what
must be, Maziar.

"This is what must be."

(MAZIAR CHUCKLES)
Oh, man, that guy!

Who talks like that?

I can't believe
he let you film it.

Why not? He's a poster boy
for the Supreme Leader.

What's he got to be afraid of?

Looking like
an ignorant asshole.

He's not alone, you know.

Yeah. Neither am I.

Do you think
that's gonna happen?

I don't care.

Bahari is not some street thug.

He will be well-prepared

ROSEWATER: Of course.

HAJ: I've given you the

But, Javadi, we must
have his confession!

Do you understand?
Of course, sir.

The people in

how they have been
fooled by these traitors.

We can end this,

but we must show them how
their leaders have been

receiving orders
from foreigners,

Zionists and Jews in the West.

They will listen

Yes, sir.

Because if this is about

You can film.

I'm fully accredited by

You can film.

You are here because
that's what happens

Yes, we know you are a spy.

A spy?
Yes.

The game is over,
Mr. Bahari.

For CIA, MIG, Mossad,
Newsweek-You tell me.

No, Newsweek the carpenter.

No, no, sir. No, no.

As a spy, I'm just trying

<i>MAZIAR: The first thing
to know about Iran</i>

<i>Americans and Iranians have
a lot of things in common,</i>

<i>more than they
have differences.</i>

<i>What do I have

So can you tell me why...

just a journalist will meet
up with this American spy

on the eve of the unrest?

He's not a spy.

He's... No, it's a show.
It's a show?

A comedy show.
It's stupid...

It's very stupid, yes.

He's a comedian

So, can you tell me
why an American

pretending to be a spy had
chosen to interview you?

And why would a real spy
have a TV show'?

Why did you tell this man

that America and Iran has
something in common?

Was that funny, too?

You know, Khamenei said that
America is the Great Satan.

But maybe you don't
think that's right.

Maybe we have been hasty.

We kicked America
out of the door

and you will bring them

No, sir.

The truth is you are a spy,

working with the Americans

to destroy our holy system.

You are a spy.

Yes.
No, no, no.

MAZIAR: The American
government doesn't

control Newsweek magazine.

To be honest, it's not even
worth controlling anymore.

Is it?
Yes.

Yes, it is. This weekly
model of magazines

is completely outdated.
Outdated?

There are better ways
of doing propaganda.

Through the Internet.
In the blogs.

There's many things. The

Yes.

When was this?

In 1953.

He was accused

Yes.

He was a communist back then.

On whose authority
was he detained?

MAZIAR: Under the Shah.

Yes.

The Shah of Iran.

I'm sorry.

Thai must have been
difficult for your family.

Thank you, sir.

But I thought at that time,

Iran had a democratic leader.

Mossadegh.
Mohammad Mossadegh.

So there was a coup?

Yes.
Organized by?

The CIA. The
Americans, British...

Operation Ajax
I believe it was called.

The West wanted
the Iranian people's oil.

Yes.

And the journalists

that were paid by the CIA to
spread lies and violence,

their puppet the traitor,
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi...

Yes, but that was

But I am not a spy!

this is history!

We are not crazy.
This is not paranoia!

Why did you meet

then what is it?

Many people seek to destroy us.

And many people
don't admit that easily.

I was not seeking this.

Good.

A pleasure to see you
again, Mr. Bahari.

And it's a pleasure, sir.

HAJ: I hope your time here
has not been too unpleasant.

Well, the nature
of prison is...

It's prison, right?

HAJ: Yes.

Please.
Yes.

HAJ: As you know,
the discipline

of media espionage
is a new one.

Oh, yes, it is everywhere.
It's a new trend.

The West has been quite
effective in blurring the line

between a spy and journalists.

We must catch up if we are
to battle effectively.

Do you understand?

Do you want me to become a spy?

We want you to help our holy
system with information.

Now' this is a letter
of commitment...

Mmm-hmm.
...Mr. Bahari.

Read it thoroughly,
sign it, stamp it.

The letter basically is for you

to provide us with
reports, information,

any anti-Iran activity.
And the letter...

Yes. Yes.
Excellent.

Specialist.

Because of your
diligence and good work

on behalf of Islamic Republic,

this man is back on the
path of righteousness.

Seyyed!

MAZIAR: Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Bahari.

Blindfold.

Thank you, sir.

Thank you.

So the man they accused
of being a spy

is not a spy.

But if you would like
to become a spy,

you know, for us, that
would be appreciated.

SEYYED: Bahari.

Seyyed.

SEYYED: Come.


<i>STEWARDESS:</i> (OVER <i>PA) Good
morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

<i>On behalf of Captain Dazmond
and the entire crew,</i>

<i>welcome aboard
ï¬‚ight number 3826.</i>

<i>Nonstop service
from Tehran to London.</i>

<i>Our ï¬‚ight time will be
six hours and 15 minutes.</i>

<i>Si! back, relax,
and enjoy the flight.</i>


FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you
like some coffee, sir?

And here's your tea.

Thanks very much.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Coffee or tea?

<i>MAZIAR: Finally, I was free.</i>

<i>But my joy is tempered
by those I left behind.</i>

<i>People that did not
have the advantage</i>

<i>of international attention.</i>

<i>Countrymen and women,</i>

<i>whose only crime
against the state</i>

<i>is not believing
in its perfection.</i>

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

<i>And the acolytes.
Those without imagination.</i>

<i>"(hose who,
even in my confinement,</i>

<i>were more alone
and afraid than I.</i>

<i>Because in their hearts,
they know they cannot win.</i>

(LIVELY SONG PLAYING)
