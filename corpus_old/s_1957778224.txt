There.

Kill all the newborn males--

Give me back my son.

Put guards at all the gates.

I won't let them take him!

Okay.

Oh. (gasps)

I'll hide him in the reeds by the river.
No, wait...

If they catch you,
they'll kill us all.

You'd sacrifice

He was found by a princess
of the royal household.

(gasps)
(baby crying)

There, there.

Are you mad?
This is a slave child.

Are you mad?
This is a slave child.

I don't care.
I was meant to find him.

I don't care.
I was meant to find him.

But Pharaoh had all the slaves
male infants Killed.

But Pharaoh had all the slaves
male infants Killed.

He had a dream
that one of them

would lead a rebellion
against the throne.

But, really,
I didn't find him.

He found me.

You cannot let him live.

I shall call him Moses.

What if he is The One

who's destined
to bring down the Pharaoh?

If power is meant
to change hands...

If this child--
if he is the future,

If he is the Chosen One...

then he will bring
wealth and power

to those he thinks of
as his family.

You saved his life.
He must know that.

He must know
what he owes you and me.

to ask if any of the slaves

<i>will be a witness
for a newborn child.</i>

<i>Will be a witness
for a newborn child.</i>

His mother will say yes.

What if it's a trap?

Then we have to risk it
for his sake.

Then we have to risk it

Tell her you will take
the child back when it's safe.

Until then, she is to care
for it as if it's her own.

No, no, no.

No, no, no.

to another son, Menerith,

But she loved Moses no less.

Prince Moses, put your full
weight behind it.

All right, once again.

The brothers grew up

as children of privilege,
trained to take their place

among the many princes
of Egypt.

As part of their education,

They were taught
the hidden mysteries

of the house of the dead
and of the Sun god Ra

and the many other gods
of Egypt.

You may want to cover
your noses and your mouths.

You may want to cover
your noses and your mouths.


Prince Moses.

You there, back to work.

A man is but a shell,

Given the breath of life
by the gods,

And when that breath
is taken away from him,

This is all that remains.

How many gods are there
in the world?

Oh, as many gods
as there are nations,

As many gods
as there are men.

Who made the gods?

I'm afraid I don't understand
your question.

Where did they come from?
They just are.

They are part of
the natural order of things.

They are part of
the natural order of things.

Look long enough,
and very soon, what happens?

Look long enough,
and very soon, what happens?

The stars begin
to make patterns,

And it's possible
to understand those patterns

And predict how they might
change in time.

You're princes of Egypt,
not barbarians.

You need to know
these things.

No.

Loyalty is a wonderful
quality, prince Moses,

Loyalty is a wonderful
quality, prince Moses,

But you'd be better served
curbing that temper of yours.

But you'd be better served
curbing that temper of yours.

You can't catch me.

Come back here!

All this time,
the child had been unaware

of the dark secret
of his birth.

I have to tell him.

Why must you?

Because I made a promise.

I'm gonna kill you!


You've always known that you
and Menerith weren't brothers--

At least, not by blood...

At least, not by blood...

I know you adopted me.

And I know that two brothers
have never been closer,

but now,
you have to know the rest.

But now,
you have to know the rest.


Moses.

This is your father.

I'm Jochebed,
your mother.

I'm Jochebed,
your mother.

This is
your sister Miriam,

And that's Aaron,
your elder brother.

When you were born,

It was too dangerous
to keep you.

We had to give you up.

There was nothing else
we could do.

I held you at my breast

Until you were
old enough to walk,

And then I gave you
back to her.

Why?

We didn't just want
to save your life,

we wanted it
to be a good one.

We wanted at least one
of our children to have...

more than this.

But you gave me away.

Oh, it was because
we loved you.


Oh, my child!

Oh, my child!

The princess promised

that we could tell you
where you came from.

That's all we want,
that you should know...

That's all we want,
that you should know...

Then you can
forget about us.

Then you can
forget about us.

Inside lies the man
who led us here--Joseph.

His brother
sold him as a slave.

He rose to become
the Pharaoh's chief minister.

He brought us here to Egypt,

He brought us here to Egypt,

But when that Pharaoh died,
they enslaved us

But when that Pharaoh died,
they enslaved us

And kept us here.

Do you hear that?

That's the wind
from the desert.

That's the wind
from the desert.

That's where we came from.

Men talk
of the glories of Egypt--

The things Egypt has built,

but all of it stands
on the bones of Our People.

It's held together
by Our Blood.

Is he one of your gods?

We don't worship a corpse,
no matter how illustrious.

We don't worship a corpse,

We don't worship a corpse,

Then where are your gods?

Did the Egyptian ones
defeat them?

At one time,
we believed in a God--

A powerful one,
the only one.

A powerful one,
the only one.

But he hasn't spoken
in all these years.

Is he dead?
Some people say that.

No. No, that's not true.

Then where is he?
What has he done for us?

Then where is he?
What has he done for us?

Why does he let this
happen to us?!

Moses!

You won't send me away...

To live like that, to be a slave?
No.

To live like that, to be a slave?
No.

You're a prince of Egypt.

Your life was saved
for a reason, Moses.

Your life was saved
for a reason, Moses.

You have a great future
awaiting you.

Forget about today.

It was a mistake or a nightmare.

It was a mistake or a nightmare.

Yes, yes,
it had to be a nightmare.

Yes, yes,

You'll forget about it by morning.

This is where you belong.

Do you see a slave child there...

Do you see a slave child there...

A descendent of some

Or do you see a prince--

A prince who might one day

Pull harder! Pull!
Come on!

Pull harder! Pull!

You should marry and build
your own palace, Moses.

Join me on the next campaign
and see how a soldier lives.

Join me on the next campaign
and see how a soldier lives.

In time, perhaps.

You have to get out
into the desert

where the gods set rules

before you get too soft
for city living.

What is he a god of?

Thirst, hunger and slow death?
No, thank you.

I like the city.

All a civilized man needs
is here.

is here.

I have to get my men
ready for review.

Forget the desert.

You're much more at home

What's the matter,
don't you like me? (laughs)

(woman panting)
No, no! Please, please, please!

Get out of my way.
Have mercy. Please don't hurt her.

Get out of my way you scum!
She's my wife. Please have mercy.

You dog. Aah! Aah!

You can watch.

It'll be even sweeter.

It'll be even sweeter.

(woman) Oh!
Leave her alone.

My prince.

I said, leave her alone.

But she's only a slave.

Don't.

Oh, what would it matter, Prince?
She'd probably enjoy it.

Aah!

Aah! Aah!

Why did you do that?

Why did you kill a man
for punishing a slave?

I was angry. No one
should be treated like that.

I was angry. No one
should be treated like that.

The body's been found.

Pharaoh's given orders
for your arrest.

You have to leave.

I won't let them take you.
You don't have any choice.

He has to leave now, immediately.

Why don't you ask your slaves
to protect you?

I don't want
to bring trouble to them.

No, you'd rather
bring trouble here.

Come now.

Could I stand by
and do nothing? Could I?

She was a slave.

Run. Go to your desert
and die,

And while you're dying, think
of what you've thrown away.

Think of the destiny
that awaited you here.

Think of the destiny
that awaited you here.

I'll come and find you,
bring you food and water.

No, no, I won't let you
risk your life for me.

We're brothers.
Don't forget that.

I'll never see you again.

You of all people.

I don't belong there.

I don't belong anywhere.

They should have let me die that
night when the soldiers came.

Wait!

Get out of here!

The water's ours!

We were here first.

You think I care?

I said,
we were here first.

I told you to go!


Stop!

You there...

Ohh!



Take your flock away.

You could've been killed
in a quarrel that wasn't yours.

Unless you have
someplace...

Someone to journey to.

Egyptian.

I don't know what I am.

But you've lived in Egypt?

Yes.

Never liked cities...

Especially theirs.

Unnatural.

Make you soft.
Make you crazy.

In the cities they say
the desert does that--

Makes men mad--

If you can even find
a way to survive in it.

Survive?

It's got all you need.

Not much more than that--
true, but all you need.

Not much more than that--
true, but all you need.

Just have to look.

Seven daughters--
I thought it was a curse.

Seven daughters--
I thought it was a curse.

What did I do to deserve it?

But they've learned.

Proud of them.

Especially that one.

To have a man around

When it's needed...

Like today.

I didn't stop to think.

It could've ended badly
for everyone.

But it didn't.

You did what a son
would have done for me...

Or a son-in-law.

Even one who walked out
from the desert

Even one who walked out
from the desert

Like a man
without a past,

Like a man
without a past,

Or who was running
away from one.

Don't even look
up there.

It's not safe

There's danger there.

Moses...



This is holy ground.

I am the God
of your Fathers,

I am the God
of your Fathers,

of your people
who are slaves in Egypt.

I know
of their suffering.

I know
of their suffering.

I have chosen you
to free them,

to lead them to the land which
I promised their forefathers.

To lead them to the land which
I promised their forefathers.

Go--go back to Egypt?

I killed a man there.

You will go back.

But why should they
listen to me?

Why should the Pharaoh
listen to me?

I will be with you.

You say you're their God
and my God.

You say you're their God
and my God.

Well, what is your name?

I Am Who I Am.

They won't listen to me.

They won't believe
that you've spoken to me.

They won't.
They won't. They won't.

Throw your staff
to the ground.


Pick it up.

Oh! (panting)

Don't send me.
Don't send me.

I'm not
the person you need.

I can't do this.
I can't do this.

It's you
who I've chosen.


If your people need you,
then you must go.

If your people need you,
then you must go.

I've never even
lived with them.

If their God
is telling you to go...

If their God
is telling you to go...

Is he the same god

Is he the same god
of the mountains?

I don't know.

When I asked Him His name,

He gave me an answer
I didn't really understand.

He gave me an answer
I didn't really understand.

It's as if He wants me
to discover something

about Him for myself.

I never asked for this.

You could always say no.

You could always say no.

The desert's a big place.

Perhaps big enough
for even a God not to find you.

Perhaps big enough
for even a God not to find you.


But... why aren't we happy?

We should be happy.

I listened,

and I'm obeying.

He talked to me.
I can't talk to him.


You'd think if this
is what he wanted,

He'd make the going
a little easier.

(crowd speaking indistinctly)

(cheers and laughter)

Stop.

Moses?

Moses...

My son!

Did I bring trouble to you?

All that matters
is that you're here again.

All that matters
is that you're here again.

You don't
have to hide anymore.

The old Pharaoh is dead.

Ramses is Pharaoh now.

It'll all be
like it was before.

You'll be a prince again.

This is my wife...

And my son.

Where I go, they go.

The palace.

No, not there.

No, not there.

Is this the house
of Amram Jochebed?

It was.

And you are?

Moses.

My name is Moses.

I'm Miriam...

Your sister.

Can it really be you?

Come.

Please, come.

They're both dead now--

Our father first

And then our mother.

But she never forgot you.

I'd see her sitting there,

and I knew she was thinking
about where you were--

What had
become of you.

What had
become of you.

Yes...

You were always
her favorite

Even though
you never lived here,

Never had to live with--

Why are you back?

What do you want...

Egyptian?

No man believes
he speaks to God

unless he's out
of his mind.

He spoke to me.

And I argued with Him.

With God?

He can be demanding.

He gets angry at times.
He's unpredictable.

He has all this power,
and yet, he has to come

To somebody like me
to do things on his behalf.

That makes him a little
short-tempered at times.

You are talking about him
as if he's a person.

He is... To me,

Although he's still my God. He is our God.
You are mad.

He's told me how
you're going to help me.

Me?
I know what you think about me, Aaron,

But God wants to use you, too.

You're a part of his plan
just as much as I am.

So God lets us be kept
in slavery for all these years,

So God lets us be kept
in slavery for all these years,

and then he decides
to free us,

and the person that he chooses
to do that is you?

Helped by you.

But he doesn't send you back
with an army--

Just that barbarian wife.

You're going to lead
a rebellion?

You, who's never spent
more than one night here?

Who everyone here knows
you turned your back on us!

You turned your back
on everyone!

All I know is that
I am who I am has sent me.

All I know is that
I am who I am has sent me.

Who?

I Am Who I Am.

How do you know that name?

God told me his name.

God told me his name.

But he wants me
to think about it.

Find some...
inner meaning in it.

That name is
never to be spoken.

That name is
never to be spoken.

When Joseph
brought us here...

he told us
that one of the ways

that God would reveal himself
was in those words.

That God would reveal himself
was in those words.

" Am Who I Am."

Time isn't right.

Even if we believed you...

The people
aren't ready for this.

You think the Egyptians will
let us go just because we asked?

You are talking
of a rebellion!

It takes years of planning.
It takes an army.

You think
we don't want freedom?

You think we haven't
dreamed of it?

The Egyptians will fight back,

And we know what that means.

And who are you anyway?

He's Moses.

He saved my life

And my wife's honor.

This is a good man.

Whatever he has to say,
you should listen to him.

He may be a good man.

That doesn't mean we should
follow him to disaster.

That we should lose
what little we have...

just because he says
that God spoke to him.

Just because he says
that God spoke to him.

Did he?

In the desert, yes.

I don't know
why God chose me.

I'm a stranger.
I've never shared your burdens.

Some of you probably think

I'm more of an Egyptian
than a slave even now,

But I know what happened to me
out there.

But I know what happened to me
out there.

I know what God wants me to do

I know what God wants me to do

With Aaron's help.

<i>383</i>

Pharaoh,
free your slaves!

They came here as free men.
Let them leave as free men.

They came here as free men.
Let them leave as free men.

We've given you our labor
and our blood for 400 years.

Now you give us
something--

Our freedom.

My people built this.

They created
the wealth of Egypt.

They created
the wealth of Egypt.

Is their freedom too much
to ask in return?

Is their freedom too much
to ask in return?

Guard!

Do you have an army?

No.

Do the other slaves
have an army?

No.

Then why should I
let them go?

Because God demands it.

And where is he,
this God of yours?

And where is he,
this God of yours?

I see my gods...

My priests.

I don't see yours.

But he's more powerful a God
than all of yours.

But he's more powerful a God
than all of yours.

Really?

A slave god more powerful
than the gods of all this?

A slave god more powerful
than the gods of all this?


(all gasping)


The children of Egypt
perform tricks like this.

The children of Egypt
perform tricks like this.


What are you trying to prove?

You allow your people
to follow their gods.

You allow your people
to follow their gods.

Let us follow ours.

Let us go into the desert
for three days to worship.

And then what?

You will willingly return?

Perhaps in that time
you'll change your mind.

I doubt it.

Enough!

Pharaoh will not
haggle with a slave.

Pharaoh will not
haggle with a slave.

Take them back
to the quarters.

They should be at work
with the others.

A slave is still a slave,
even if he thinks

A slave is still a slave,
even if he thinks

his God has told him
to argue with his master.

Menerith?

You make sure
that one knows

how hard slaves
are expected to work.

How hard slaves
are expected to work.

It's you.

This is my brother, too.

I see only
one of our masters.

He's my brother.

Is it true?

You found the God
you were always seeking?

He found me.

And did he send you
back here?

He does what he wants.

I'm learning that.

Sometimes
I argue with him,

but he always wins.

He won't win
with Ramses.

Despite appearances,
he's a weak, insecure man.

Despite appearances,
he's a weak, insecure man.

They're the most dangerous
when you attack them.

You didn't just attack him.
You humiliated him in public.

I don't suppose
you could talk our brother

Into leaving things
as they are?

I'm his brother.
You're his owner.

Aaron's as
hot-tempered as me.

His tongue
is just as sharp.

Maybe that's why God
chose us to work together.

And die together.
If it comes to that, yes.

It won't. I told you.
God spoke to me.

He made me a promise.

He may be difficult,
but sometimes I wonder

if he doesn't think he made
a mistake in choosing me.

But he made me a promise.
He will not break it.


<i>383</i>

Aah!

You're not done!

There you are.

Get up!

Get up!

No water for him!
Go on!

No water for him!
Go on!


(loud, indistinct arguing)


Look at how we suffer!

Pharaoh died because
this Moses upset the Pharaoh!

Pharaoh died because
this Moses upset the Pharaoh!

Where did he come from?
Who is he?

What gives him the right
to speak for us?

What have you done to us?

Now Pharaoh has ordered us
to collect our own straw.

Listen to him!

Do you know how long
that will take each day?

We still have to
do the same work!

Listen! Listen to him!

He died just trying
to keep up with the work!

Listen!

Which one of us
will die tomorrow

and the day after, thanks to you?
Listen!

Would you rather stay slaves?
Is that it?

You like your chains?

You want your wives and your
children to live like animals?

Do you want permission
to live and die?




The Egyptians killed him.

They killed him!

Tomorrow they might kill you
or you or you!

Tomorrow they might kill you
or you or you!

Years ago, their soldiers--
they came here in the night,

and they killed
all the newborn males.

And they killed
all the newborn males.

You didn't want
to fight back then.

You don't want
to fight back now!

No, you want to blame those
who want to save you

from such a thing
happening again!

Because a man
is born in slavery,

Because a man
is born in slavery,

that doesn't mean
that he is a slave!

He has to think of himself
as a slave before he is one.

He has to think of himself
as a slave before he is one.

To be a free man, you have
to stop thinking like one.

To be a free man, you have
to stop thinking like one.

To be a free man, you have

God sent me here
to lead you out of here!

God sent me here
to lead you out of here!

How do we know it was you
he spoke to?

And what he said?

My words--My words
aren't enough for you?

They weren't good enough
for the Pharaoh.

That's the point.

That's the point.


You've thought it over?

Come to plead with me?

Apologize.

To give you
one final warning.

Free your slaves.

Guard!

But why? Why are you
sending me away?

Don't you love me anymore?
I love you.

Don't you love your son?
Yes.

Then why do I have to leave?

I'm asking everyone to give up
everything they've ever known.

I'm asking everyone to give up
everything they've ever known.

I have to give up
something, too.

Me? Gershom?

If there were any other way,
but I have so much to do.

If there were any other way,
but I have so much to do.

Terrible things are about to happen--
Shh.

More terrible than
anyone has ever known.

I don't want the two people
who mean most to me

To be here for them.

I know how powerful
this God is.

I know how powerful
this God is.

He's more powerful
than anyone can ever imagine.

He's more powerful
than anyone can ever imagine.

Side by side
Moses and his brother

took on the might of Egypt.

It's time.

First the Nile--

The lifeline of Egypt
turned to blood.


Aah!



Look!

It is red silt from the river.

It is red silt from the river.

Come and see the trick.

Oh. (laughs)
Look at that.

Oh. (laughs)
Look at that.



Enough.

Take it away!

When the river died,

the animals that survived
invaded the land.


Aah!

Aah!

Aah!


And then the animals died...

and starvation threatened.

Oh.


Your quarrel is with me.

Your quarrel is with me.

Your God's quarrel
is with me.

Your God's quarrel
is with me.

Must all my people suffer
because of it?

Unless you do his bidding, yes.

Tell him to do his worst.

I'll not surrender to him...

Or to you.

Or to you.

(locusts chirping)

Then the locusts came

and ate what little food
was left.

Help! Ohh!

Help! Ohh!

My son. My firstborn.

My son. My firstborn.

Imre.

Imre.

I told him
all about you.

I wanted him to meet you.
(Moses laughs)

This is Moses, my brother...

A great, great man.

A great, great man.

Wait for me by the gate.

How much longer
will this torment continue?

Until he frees us.

He'd have had you killed by now.

He knows what your God can do.

He's afraid of his power.

Ramses can put an end to it
at any time.

Ramses can put an end to it
at any time.

A weak man is the worst
for adversaries.

A weak man is the worst
for adversaries.

He mistakes stubbornness
for strength.

He'll fight on when a strong man
would leave the battlefield,

Knowing all is lost.

Knowing all is lost.

You're a stubborn man, too.

Because I know I'll win.
God will win.

Because I know I'll win.
God will win.

And then what?

Ramses will free us.

And what can we do
in the meantime?

And what can we do
in the meantime?

Pray to your gods

that Ramses will spare
your people further suffering.

They were your people, too,
once...

Weren't they?


Get out! Get out!
Come on!

Get out! Get out!
Come on!

Come on, come on, priest.
Get out!

Come on, come on, priest.
Get out!


Get out there!
Now do something!

Get out there!
Now do something!


Protect him!

No.

No.

No.

No.

Surrender to a slave...

Is that what you want
your Pharaoh to do?

Aah!


Who else counsels this?
Hmm?

Who else counsels this?
Hmm?



(wind howling)

The skies rained down
pestilence and fire,

leaving the Pharaoh
and his sorcerers powerless.

Until the very face
of Ra himself

was hidden from view.

Was hidden from view.

Ah, there. You see?

Ah, there. You see?

It is not possible

For the mighty Egypt
could be destroyed

By this man Moses and his God.

But there are those
who begin to fear it.

But there are those
who begin to fear it.

They say freeing a few slaves

is but a small price to pay.

Shh!

Menerith...

How much longer
can I count on my army?

I'm a soldier.
I'll tell you in plain words.

I'm a soldier.
I'll tell you in plain words.

Men have seen their women
and children go hungry...

seen them fall sick,

seen them lose everything
they have including their faith

in the power of the Pharaoh
to protect them.

This is blasphemy!
Silence!

They would rather
have the slaves freed

Than lose
what little they have.

I am Pharaoh.

Centuries look down on me.

I am a god.

I am a god.

No.

No.

No.

I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

Pharaoh!
Pharaoh, years ago,

the previous Pharaoh
had a vision

of a prince of Egypt

who would bring
mortal danger to the kingdom.

Moses is no prince of Egypt.
He's a slave.

Moses is no prince of Egypt.
He's a slave.

No, he's not a slave.

He's my son.

I found him in the river...

I found him in the river...

and I brought him up
as my own child...

and I brought him up
as my own child...

and I brought him up
as my own child...

as a prince of Egypt.

I told the Pharaoh
this prince of Egypt

I told the Pharaoh
this prince of Egypt

Aould bring down
both horse and rider!

Aould bring down
both horse and rider!

Get out!

Get him out!
(laughing)

Get him out!
(laughing)

Go!

Make him go!

Just the men.

No, the women
and the children, too.

No, the women
and the children, too.

The women,
but not the children?

All, everybody--
the old, the young,

every slave you own.

Not the flocks and herds.

Yes.
No.

We leave nothing
that is ours.

That is not for you to say.

No, it's for God,
but he speaks through me.

No, it's for God,
but he speaks through me.

I am Pharaoh.

I am Moses.

I'm willing to bargain.

I am not.

(shape fingers)
(man) Guards!

I am the Sun,
the Moon, the Nile.

I am the Sun,
the Moon, the Nile.

I rule in this kingdom...

And I rule
in the life after death.

If this man
enters the palace again,

If this man
enters the palace again,

He is to be killed...

Instantly.

And what now?

What now?


Very near.

Our God has brought us
this far.

Our God has brought us
this far.

There is only
a little way to go.

There is only
a little way to go.

These are our last hours
as slaves. Remember them.

Tell your children
to tell their children

how bitter
our captivity was.

We must never forget.

Are you ready?

Yes.

Yes!

(all shouting)

(all shouting)

Get ready for a journey.

Roast meat...

bake bread,
eat with the bitter herbs

that have been all we have had
to savor our food with.

Be ready to leave
at any moment.

Be ready to leave
at any moment.

Smear some of the blood
from your meal

over the door of your house.
Do not forget that.

Every door must have
that sign on it.

It will protect you...

And then wait.

Wait.

Wait.

Moses, my brother!

Menerith.

My son was taken, too.

My son was taken, too.

I grieve with you.

I grieve with you.

You... grieve?

You... grieve?

Wasn't this your doing?

It was God's.

You willed it.

Ramses will give you
your freedom now.

Ramses will give you

Your God won.

I think
your god is a cruel one.

Years ago,

Pharaoh sent his soldiers
to kill our children.

I wasn't among them.

My son wasn't there.

My son wasn't there.

Why should we be punished?

I do what God tells me.

I do what God tells me.

If he told you to kill me...

would you do it?

Would you?

Would you?

Yes.

The men and the women
and the children.

The men and the women
and the children.

Yes.

With all
their flocks and herds.

With all
their flocks and herds.

Yes.

Before they leave,
their masters and mistresses

will give them
gold and silver...

No.

As tribute for their labor
of 400 years.

As tribute for their labor
of 400 years.

Yes.

(Bit hi a)
Menerith won't see you.

He's still grieving
for his son...

for my grandson.

I can't pretend
to understand.

Sometimes I think I don't know
who you are anymore.

Sometimes I think I don't know
who you are anymore.

Perhaps I never did.

Perhaps I never did.

All I know
is that I love you.

You're my son, too,

You're my son, too,

and I'll never stop
loving you.

And I'll never stop
loving you.

Will I ever see you again?

Will your God
let me see you again?

Will your God
let me see you again?



It's time!
We're leaving quickly! Hurry!

It's time! Now!

Now! We're leaving!
Now, now, now!

We're leaving!
Come on, quickly!


You brought us here...

You brought us here...

and the Egyptians
betrayed us.

And the Egyptians
betrayed us.

Now I'm taking them back
to the only place I can...

Now I'm taking them back
to the only place I can...

The desert.

What are you doing?

You can't disturb
Joseph's grave.

This is sacrilege.
We're his tribe,

Not the Egyptians.
He belongs with us.


Keep them moving.
We're not safe yet.

He could still
change his mind. Come on.

(crowd speaking indistinctly)


we've made it.



Where do we go, Moses?
Which way?

The Promised Land--
where is it?

How do we get to it?

How long will it take?

How will we live
till we get there?

(wind howling)

There.

My son.

My little boy.

No.

You lost your son, too.

Had we known Moses'...

Brother.

Who are you?

Menerith...

Fight.

Fight!

(horses neighing)

Whoa.

Go back. Tell Pharaoh.


(yells command)

(man responds to command)


Onward!

(men shouting)


Come on!

Come on!

Here!

We stop here!

You fool!

We're trapped.

You've lead us into a trap.
What kind of leader are you?

You'll have us killed, all of us!
Enough!

(seagulls squawking)

(seagulls squawking)

Moses...

You know my voice?

You know my voice?

Yes.

You know who I am?

Yes.

Do you trust me?

Yes. Yes.

Yes. Yes.

(shouting and screaming)



Yah!

(thunder crashing)

Oh!
(thunder crashing)

Oh!
(thunder crashing)

This is witchcraft.

It must be.

Or God's word.

I say witchcraft!

No, it's the only way to escape.

No, it's the only way to escape.




Oh!


Keep going! Keep going!

Keep going! Keep going!


Come on!

(baby cries)

Keep moving.
Keep moving. Hurry!

Keep moving.
Keep moving. Hurry!

I'm coming.

Aaron, don't be afraid.

Aaron, don't be afraid.

Keep going! Go!
Keep going!

Keep going! Go!
Keep going!

(woman screams)

Keep going! Have faith!

Hurry!

(horses neighing)

Moses!

See to the others.

(horse neighs)

They're slaves!

They're unarmed!

Go!

(all yelling)

Go! Come on!

Go! Go, quickly!


Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!


Keep moving!
Don't look back at them!

Keep going!

Come on! Don't look back!

Trust in your God!
Keep moving!

Don't look back!
Don't look back!


Come on! Come on!

Come on! Come on!

Come on! Hyah!

Save yourself, brother.

(all yelling)

Have them collect
all the weapons.

We still may need them.


Moses!

Moses!

Everyone is celebrating.

So what now?

I don't know.

Well,
where do we go?

Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

But after that?

But after that?

We'll find another,

and then a way to feed them
once the bread runs out.

What happens to us now?
Now we are free.

We stay together, and then
we wait for God to tell us

When to go to the land
he's promised us.

What are you doing?

(goats bleating)

I'm going to find grazing,
water and food for my family.

By yourself?

Why not?
No.

We stay together.

Because you say so?

Because God
has a plan for us.

There behind you lies Egypt.

So there's no going back
that way.

So it has to be the desert.

We have bread for many days,
but water for only a few.

We have bread for many days,
but water for only a few.

We've no tents,
no means of sheltering

We've no tents,
no means of sheltering

Against the cold
of the night.

None of you know
how to live in the desert.

Most of you are scared of it.

I was, too,
when I first came here,

But I learned to live in it,
and so will you.

But I learned to live in it,
and so will you.

Abraham was a nomad!
So were Isaac and Jacob!

Abraham was a nomad!
So were Isaac and Jacob!

The desert's in our blood.

We should be at home here
if anyone is.

We should be at home here
if anyone is.

newly freed slaves set out

on one of mankind's
epic journeys

led by a man
who many of them believe

wasn't even truly
one of them,

each step taking them further
into the unknown.

Each step taking them further
into the unknown.


Put it down.

You'd make him
give up his life for yours?

It's you
who's risking his life--

Risking all our lives.

What should we do...

Go back to Egypt...

Beg to be slaves again?

By day, we scorch to death.
By night, we freeze.

By day, we scorch to death.
By night, we freeze.

How many of us will be left

by the time you know
where you're leading us?

Nobody has
to burn or freeze,

but they have to work.

Slaves have always
had masters to rely upon.

They'll bow their backs
as long as their owner

gives them a few racks
to put on it...

tosses them scraps of food,
tells them what to do.

Tosses them scraps of food,
tells them what to do.

I don't want to be
a slave again.

Then start acting
like a free man.

Take care of yourself,

And don't take
what doesn't belong to you.

And don't take
what doesn't belong to you.


Not yet.

They're right
to question me.

I brought them here,

but I don't know
where to go next.

Can't you tell me?

Can't you tell me?

Have it your way.
Make me work it out for myself.

Maybe you're having doubts
about having chosen me.

I'm not clever enough or brave
enough or strong enough.

If that's it, it's fine by me.
I never asked to lead them.

If that's it, it's fine by me.
I never asked to lead them.

"I Am Who I Am."
What does that mean?

Why give me a riddle to solve?

What is it that you're trying
to get me to see?

(bird's wings flapping)


Your brother
is a remarkable man.

As remarkable as you.

As remarkable as you.

God speaks to him,

and he speaks to God.

I'm talking about
your other brother.

This man Moses
walks in from the desert

and says God has chosen him,
and Aaron follows blindly,

and says God has chosen him,
and Aaron follows blindly,

without any questions,
just as you do.

Such love and devotion,

such putting oneself aside
for somebody else.

It's rare, even between
brothers and sisters.

Don't you believe
he talks to God?

I believe he believes that.

And that God speaks to him?

He believes that, too.

But even you
have to take his word for it.

It's not just his word.

We've seen
God working through him.

Wasn't Aaron at his side?

Didn't you lead the people
into the sea?

God spoke to him--

Not to me, not to Aaron.

Perhaps
he's trying to do that.

It's just that
you won't listen

because Moses has convinced you,
as he's convinced us all...

that he's the one.

But he is the one.

We all know that.

Don't we?

We know that
he tells us he is.

A knife may be quicker,
but poison is more certain,

and the best poison of all
is jealousy.

<i>383</i>

(goats bleating)

(goats bleating)

(people speaking indistinctly)

We can't drink this.

We can't drink this.

This is unbearable.
We're going to perish here.

All this way,
and for what?

It's not fit to drink.

It's poisoned.

Why have you done this
to us?

You told us
there was water here.

We need water and food.

If we were gonna die
of hunger and thirst,

We could've done it
back in Egypt.

You nearly did. Remember?

And you prayed to God
to save you,

And he answered your prayers
and brought you here.

To die anyway?
You think that's what he wants?

To die anyway?
You think that's what he wants?

I don't know.

I just know that

My children are sicker now
than they were in Egypt.

My children are sicker now
than they were in Egypt.

At least there
they had water to drink.

They have water here.

It's poisoned!

Moses knows the desert,

and he'll take us
to sweet water.

To the next spring?
And how far away is that?

Days? Weeks?

How can we last
that long?

You'll drink this water.

How?!

<i>383</i>


(cheering)
It's good. It's good!

It's good! It's good!


Forgive me.

Don't ask Moses
for forgiveness. Ask God.

Don't ask Moses
for forgiveness. Ask God.

When you doubt Moses,
you doubt him.

Isn't that right, sister?

Yes.

Over there.




Moses...

Over here.


Who would do
such a terrible thing?

A Malachite.

A Malachite.

Every spring, every dead tree,
every dried-up riverbed

Every spring, every dead tree,
every dried-up riverbed

Every spring, every dead tree,
every dried-up riverbed

has been fought over
since the beginning of time.

Has been fought over
since the beginning of time.

And we are going to have
to fight

for whatever piece of it
God wants us to have.

For whatever piece of it
God wants us to have.

(thunder rumbles in distance)

Why would someone do that?

Leave the tribe,
strike out on their own?

Maybe he didn't trust
where he was being led to...

Or who was leading.

It is not only danger
from outside you have to fear.

It is not only danger
from outside you have to fear.

You have enemies here, too,

But I'll look out for you.

I have Aaron.

Maybe...

But brothers have been known
to fall out, haven't they?

But brothers have been known
to fall out, haven't they?

(goats bleating)

Come on, come on,
come on.


Don't worry.
God will provide...

Don't worry.
God will provide...

Won't you?

Look! Look!

Look! Look!


(people speaking indistinctly)

There's food for all!

Eat!

Eat!

God will send you as much
as you need every day...

No more and no less.

No more and no less.

(all cheering)

Didn't I just tell you
he'll send you

As much as you need every day?
If you store it,

that means you have no faith
in him keeping his word.


Believe in him.

That's all you have to do.

If you do that,
then he will take care of you,

And we won't
ever go hungry again...

Or thirsty.


Maybe they will
believe in you now.

I'm not so sure.
In a few days,

they'll be complaining that
they have to bend to pick it up.



There's something
I have to show you. Come.

There's something
I have to show you. Come.

Amalekites.

This can't go on.

We must protect our people.

I didn't train
as a soldier...

I didn't train
as a soldier...

nor did Aaron,

but we have to learn
how to fight--

All of us.

All of us.


No, no, not like that.
Swing first

And move your head down below.
That's it. Back to the body.

Pick up your sword.

No.

Pick it up.

No.

When God
parted the seas for us,

He did it
because we believed in him.

He did it
because we believed in him.

He sent food
and water to us.

We were thirsty
and starving.

If we choose to fight,

He'll think
we've lost that faith.

What's your name?

Joshua.

God won't fight
all our battles for us, Joshua.

I wish he would.

So much easier if he did,

but this time,
we have to do that ourselves.

And that means everyone.

When the time comes,
God will help us.

When the time comes,
God will help us.

To stop him doing that
is an insult to him.

There was a man whose house
was threatened by a flood...

When his neighbor left, he said
he should come with him.

"No," he said.
"I'm waiting for God's help.â€

"No," he said.
"I'm waiting for God's help.â€

The water kept rising.

The water kept rising.

A man on a camel
called to him.

"Jump on," he said.
"Save yourself."

"No, I'm waiting
for God's help."

The water rose to his roof.

A man in a boat came by.
He refused to get in it.

"I'm waiting
for God's help."

He drowned.

He was very angry when
he came face to face with God.

"What more did you want?"

I'm doing what you told us to--
trusting God.

I'm doing what you told us to--
trusting God.

I won't insult him and fight.

Insult him by protecting
yourself and your people?

Leave him be.

He's still thinking
like a slave.

He's still thinking
like a slave.

When someone strikes a slave,
they cower and beg,

"Please don't hit me again.â€

They wring their hands
and keep their back bent,

even while they're
being beaten to death.

A man with pride...

Pride in himself
and his family and his tribe!

Pride in himself

"Touch me, and you die."

"Touch me, and you die."

I think maybe
you might have

the makings
of a warrior after all.


Slay them all!


Aah!

They're ready.

Ready, yes,
first for the Amalekites,

And then for you.

We can't afford
to risk you in battle.

Nor you...

but I know
who should lead them.

We can't take the village,

And we can't attack
their army head on.

We have to ask ourselves,
how do they see us?

We have to ask ourselves,
how do they see us?

Who do they think we are?

Ex-slaves who can't
or won't fight.

That's right.
What do they want from us?

That's right.
What do they want from us?

They wanna steal our flocks,
kill the men and boys

And take all our women
as slaves.

So we use that against them.

any miracles today.

Today, he's testing us.

Today, he's testing us.

We want the sea to part.
If we want the rock to split,

We want the sea to part.
If we want the rock to split,

we have to do it ourselves...

with these.

It seems strange to be
holding these, doesn't it?

We've been forbidden to carry
weapons for 400 years...

We've been forbidden to carry
weapons for 400 years...

Forbidden to strike back
when someone attacked us.

when someone attacked us.

All that changes today.

You're the ones who will work
the miracles now.

Joshua will lead you in battle.

Like you, he's never
fought one before,

But the Amalekites are fighting
for loot and slaves.

But the Amalekites are fighting

We are fighting for the right

Moses.
Give us a sword.

We have enough sworders.

It's for them.

One sword won't fight off
the Amalekite army.

No...

But it can make sure
they won't take us alive.

We won't be
their concubines.

Our children
won't be their slaves.

Our children
won't be their slaves.

Wait.

Move, move. Come on.

Get over there, you.
Keep moving.

I said, stop!

I'm looking
for a man called Moses.

Moses!

Zipporah.

Zipporah!

I heard about the Moses
who defeated the Pharaoh

and his whole army...

Led his people
into the desert...

Got into a fight
with the Amalekites.


Killed them all,
burned their village...

Killed them all,
burned their village...

That was you?

The Moses
who married Zipporah,

The daughter of Jethro,
yes, who--

Who seems to want
to forget me.

Take any of them slaves?

No.

Ah, pity...
All an Amalekite is good for.

Ah, pity...
All an Amalekite is good for.

How did you do it...

That God of yours...

The one who spoke to you?

We owe it all to him, yes.

He spoke to you
in the mountains, yes?

Then he was in Egypt,

And now he's here
in the desert, too?

Yes.

You take him with you?

I think it's more like
he's with us all the time.

I think it's more like
he's with us all the time.

How?
(laughs) I don't know.

How?

How?

He's a mountain God,
and a--and a God of slaves,

and a God of free men,
and a God of the desert.

He seems to be everywhere.

He still speaks to you?

Sometimes
I think I hear him...

Sometimes
I think I hear him...

but I think he wants me
to work it all out for myself

If--if I can...

Who are you going to fight next,

I hope not
to have to fight anyone...

But I doubt
if it can be like that.

But I doubt

God promised them.

First, there's--there's

What a hard drive it is.

Dangerous at times, lonely.

Don't always do
what you tell them, do they?

Sometimes they kick you.

They have no one else
to rely on.

You feed them,
care for them,

stop the wolves
from getting to them.

But sheep

Argue with every decision

plot against you.

I have someone
to protect me.

He's the only one
I can trust

apart from
my brother and sister.

No. You can't trust anyone.

He'd lay down
his life for me.

Tonight, perhaps,

You're still not there,

Eleazar found him

that he killed him...

Proof that he hid the body?

No, but...
Then let him go.

What is it, Moses?
Are you afraid to say the word?

What kind of leadership
is that?

No, no, this is wrong!

Blood for blood.
What other way can it be?

Isn't that right?

Why make murderers

Make us share the crime?

You've had your judgment.
