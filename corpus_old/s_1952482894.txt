Bright Falls -
The Prequel to Alan Wake

So, Riley is, uh, surprising
us again tomorrow.

It's not gonna
be anyone left.

You're dying breed.

Jake, fine up,
we need the interview.

You know Riley
loves the book.

I bet.

Oh, and make sure to
get him a signed copy.

Are we done?

Libby called again.

Hey, hold on a
second, alright?

I'm running out of excuses.

Hello?

Are you there?

I'm sorry, I had
to deal with that.

Have you been home?

<i>Come on, Hal.</i>

She, uh, didn't know you
were going to Bright Falls.

Well, I guess
she does now.

So, what are you, a
detective or Peeping Tom?

Uh, both.

Reporter.

Kinky.

Interesting choise of
the decor you have there.

That's Alan Wake, the writer.

I am a big fan.

I can see that.

What can I say?
I like writers.

Wow, I didn't order this.

Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday!

Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday!

Bright Falls'
own deerfest

You Jake?

All it bucks of jiggle handle. Card
machine is down, so it'll have to be cash.

Just pay upon time.

You bet.

So is this quiet out here?

What did you do, you rid of
all the critters in the woods?

This quiet isn't what
you need to worry about.

<i>This is Pat Maine at KBF-FM.</i>

<i>Some people have asked me,
"What's the big deal about Deerfest?" </i>

<i>I think that this sums you know.
It's about friendship and community.</i>

Yeah, that's mainly
what the book's all about.

Still here.

Always.

You ever sleep?

I wonder why she
was wearing make up.

Hey!

It's great to see you again!

Great to see you too!

Sit.

How are things?

The same. Please don't ask
me about the weather.

How's Libby?

Good, you know, the same.

Will we just say
"good" or "the same"?

Forget it, don't answer,
you're here for business.

Yes.

The standard below
the full puffery.

What did you expect?
It's Bright Falls.

You know, I never figured
out why you moved here.

No, I guess not.

You know, I... I've actually
gotta run, deadlines.

If you need me,
you know where to find me?

Sure.

It's great to see you again.

You too.

Hi, Jake Fisher,
here to see Dr. Hartman.

Go right in.

Dr. Hartman, Jake Fisher.

What have you got there?

That's my camera, I use it to
record interviews if that's okay.

You're a writer, aren't you?

Yeah.

So... write.

So maybe you could start by telling me what
inspired your book "The Creator's Dilemma".

For years I talked with patients, who seem lost,
trapped in the reality of their own devising.

Can you imagine?

Neither could I, until I began to think
of their dilemma... as a universal one.

...It's really just about people.

Nice chatting, Jake.

If you need anything else
for your article, let me know.

Hey, this is Hal,
leave a message.

Hey, Hal. I, uh, I don't
know what happened. I, uh...

Hey, wait!

<i>Daniel!</i>

Hey!

Hey! Um, can I talk
to you for a second?

Sure.

Some more private?

Okay.

Didn't Hartman say anything?

I don't think he knew.

And this morning I, uh
woke up in the woods...

And my arms were just all
covered in this like red mud.

So what do you think happened?
You can potter in your sleep?

No, I woke up in the woods.

Listen, sometimes staying out
here just gets in your head.

Well, I'm done with this story.

I know.

Call me if you need anything.

Thanks.

You know... you're right.

When you're done with your
story you really should go.

Get back home, clear your head.

That's why I came here, Al.

I think you should leave.

I'm gonna have to
send out for this.

How long?

Oh, three... four...

...six days.

Six days?

Nothing... overnight?

Well, if I can get Mary
Beth to get Joe

to make his rounds up to
Fern Ridge for Tuesday...

That's pinning on the weather
tall elevation, of course.

Shel? My damn, what're you...

Wake alleged in the cause
$30000 equipment damages.

You alright?

Some woman just bit a
cop in the parking lot.

What?

You don't look so good, Jake.

Woman is like a feral animal!

Give me a towel!

Give some wet!

Deerfest - Bright Falls world
famous buckstravaganza

featuring stag party
and the Doughboys!

Admission is only a buck.
So come back and come hungry,

and don't come alone. It's a feast
for the senses at Deerfest.

Jake, how are you doing?

I'm fine. Fine.

Your message got cut.
Everything go ok?

Yeah, you bet it.

Did you get the book
signed for Riley?

Can I talk to you for a
minute off the record?

Of course.

Since I got here I've... I...

I've been blacking out and
waking up in really strange places.

What kinds of places?

In... the woods, the lake...

Look, I'm really weird when I live here,
it's... it's not gonna stop.

Anything else?

Yeah. I... I think I killed...

...a deer with my car.

It happens.

May I?

You know, I help people with
problems just like yours.

Stay with us.

What the hell is that thing?!

Just a light.

Ah!

Can I help you?

When did you contact with
the owner of this motel?

Sam?

No, I haven't seen him in a couple days.

He's gone missing.

I've found his boy in the
woods looking for him.

May I?

Sure.

Well that's particular.

Well, I'm from the city, you know.

And uh...

It's gonna some kinda stupid but I...

...left the door open last night.

And... Some kind of wild
animal must have... came in here.

What squirrel animal did this?

You see the markings?
Well, I'd say it's a 14 points stag.

You know...

See the pattern?

Cut and buck.

Horn rib entry points.

You had a trophy deer here,
you know that?

Imperial. That first old
Sam'll have a prize.

It's too bad a flue tube... probably
on some blender. It's got a bad habit.

Boys are gonna love this.

<i>...had no idea...</i>

<i>Are you there?</i>

What's wrong?

I need your help.
Come with me.

You have to tell me
what's happening.

Just drive.

Are you gonna say anything?

Where am I even heading?

Just get me out.

That's it. You just need
to ride out of town.

Why did you come looking for me?
You could've just driven yourself.

No, I couldn't have.

I'm not in control.

What does that mean?

Jake!

What happened, officer?

Some guy missed the turn here.

Probably a deer or something.

Just be careful to this
next stretch of road.

Okay, thanks.
