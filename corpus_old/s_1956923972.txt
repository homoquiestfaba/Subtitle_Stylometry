Will you take me
to a love hotel?

Sure.

WOMAN: <i>I tell myself
there is no happy ending.</i>

<i>All the pieces do not
fit together perfectly.</i>

<i>Things are ragged and messy.</i>

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Good morning, Tamiko.

I like your outfit.

Thank you.

Rockstar (SPEAKING
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE).

Rockstar, I like
that, we have to go.


Margaret, we are
waiting for you.

Is everything okay?

I'm fine, thank you.

Hi.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(TRAIN RUSTLING)

(UPBEAT MUSIC)

Hi.

Hi.

Hello.

Hi!

God, I really love this place.

You keep saying that.

Come by.

Cheers to that!

Cheers.

I wonder what it's
like to be a drunk.

You wonder?

No, no, no, I don't mean
like a drunk, like us.

I mean like a real drunk.

Absolutely.

If you wear a helmet
and B-pads to a bar

because know you're
going to fall over,

like that kind of drunk, all in.

You get it?

Yeah, no fucking around.

No fucking around, exactly.


(UPBEAT JAPANESE ROCK MUSIC)

What did I miss?

Are you guys talking about me?

No, no, never.

Let's go find trouble.

Thank you.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

How come you never take me

to a love hotel?

You know, we could,

we could go half along the bell.

No pressure, like.

You're like a brother to me.

(TRAIN RAMP BLARING)

(TRAIN THUNDERING)

There you are.

Where did you go?

Come on, I need a drink.

You know, I actually,
I think I'm good.

I'm going to go.

Fair enough.

Bye, bye!

Yeah, it's nice.

Get yourself.

Which one do you want?

This one, yeah?

Okay.

You like the blue?

Yeah.

It's good, I haven't been here.

Kawaii.

Cute.

Here, pull.

What?

Pull.

Okay.

Pull, hard.

Hard.

Pull, pull.

Harder, harder.

Harder.

I can't.

I'm sorry.

I want to know your mind.

No, you don't.

I'm sorry.

Hi, sorry

I think you have the flu.

You should take the day
off, don't you think?

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

I'm going to speak
bluntly, I'm sorry.

Do you know why I hired you?

Because nobody else applied.

I hired you because
you remind me of me.

That's crazy.

I mean, you're
like, you're a lady.

I mean that in a good way.

Yes.

I'm a middle-aged
lady with no husband,

and no children

and everyone here
thinks I'm kind of sad

and strange.

No, they don't.

And if they do, then fuck them.

But they still know
they can learn something

from me and you.

But you can teach
them something too.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Hawkseye, do you like?

Yeah, it looks like fun.

No, I mean, do you like
Hawkseye, the artist?

Yeah, him too.

What are you looking for?


My bag.

My bag.

How do you know that
I'm not a bad man?

I don't.

If I don't sleep in
the next five minutes.

What?

I think I'm gonna
die, don't laugh.

You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine.

Can you help me,
please, Katrine.

Well, hello.

Hello!

Hi.

Let's get on me, three.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

I think someone's
been deflowered.

Compliments to the lord
(SPEAKING IN HEAVY ACCENT)

I don't think I was
ever truly flowered.

Come on, who is it?

His name is Kazu and he
is the most beautiful man

I have ever seen.

Be careful then.

All these days
have came and went,

little did I know
what it's like.

What?

You think it's
ridiculous, I know.

What?

Roleplaying?

I kind of like it actually,

it's kind of fun to be
someone other than myself,

you know?

I meant the whole thing.

Flight attendant school.

I'm in no position
to be a snob, at all.

Here, that's right, right?

Yes.

Just a bit over here, okay.

Did you ever want
to get married?

I did.

But I fell in love
with the wrong man.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Okay, so what
will it be today?

Screaming baby, terrorist?

Vegan?

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Oh, Mr. Pervert, very good.

So you need to be strong.

Konnichi wa.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Yeah, I could eat.

Okay.

Thank you.

I like this car.

Yeah?

I'm scared to touch anything.

Don't worry, we're
just eating, talk,

no funny business.

No hanky panky?

So, sushi, beer if you want?

I want, yeah.

What do you do up there?

Basically it's
a group of girls

that want to be
flight attendants.

So I basically pronounce
English to them.

So you are English teacher?

Not really.

More like a
pronunciation teacher.

How's my pronunciation?

It's good, it's really good.

Good?

Yeah, you could teach.

Can I ask, hanky panky?

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Can we go somewhere else?

Yes.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

You like?

This is better.

So, why Japan?

To be alone.

I came to Japan to be alone.

Sometimes being alone
isn't about other people.

Did you try this?

Is it chicken?

Chicken...

Elbow.

Elbow

Chicken elbow.

Chicken elbow.

Chicken elbow on a stake.

It's crunchy.

Cartilage.

Cartilage, yes.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Yes.

Crunchy (SPEAKING IN
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE).

Sorry, sorry.

Don't worry about it.

Okay.

Margaret.

Sometimes alone
is about people.

Why do you like me?

You're special.

How do you know?

Difficult to make
you happy, I think.

But I like the challenge.

How about you, can
I make you happy?

Again, I'm happy.

I like a challenge too.

I'm getting married.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

What?

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN
LANGUAGE) means happy and sad.

Happy-sad.

Yes, happy-sad.

Wait, we still
have time for sleep.

I'm not a napper.

Do you ever clean this place?

Really?

Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

It's like I was born
with no ability to clean,

like how sociopaths are
born without a conscience.

I think I'm destined to go nuts.

I think it's
happening right now.

I think it might be, you know,

your gangster guy.

Love is insanity
by another name.

He said he's getting married.

Oh yeah.

That sucks.

It sucks?

It does.

That's it?

Is that the best you can do?

I'm sorry.

Do you know why the
Japanese love their fucking

cherry blossom trees so much?

No, it's not because
they're pink and pretty,

it's because they don't last.

Like everything that's
perfect and beautiful.

It just doesn't last.

It's not the point.

Come on, take this.

Look at you.

You've bruises, that
doesn't look good.

Come here.

Enjoy the fucking ride, okay?

(UPBEAT CLUB MUSIC)

I'm going to find my pill guy.

Okay.



Your individual life vest

is located in a pouch
beneath your seat.

Should its use become necessary,

remove it from the
plastic packet.

Slip it over your head and pull
downward on the front panel.

Bring the straps around
your waist and insert them

into the buckle
on the front hole.

Pull on the loose straps
until the vest fits snugly

as we are now demonstrating.

As you leave the aircraft,

inflate the vest by pulling
down firmly on the red tabs.

The vest may be orally inflated

by blowing into the inflation
tubes at shoulder level.

Thank you for your attention.

We will be airborne shortly.


They were so good,
they were so good.

They were.

You were great.

Thank you.

I'm so proud.

Me too.

Do you think they're
ready for mock interviews

after graduation?

Yeah, yeah, of course.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Have you ever cut
off someone's finger?

Cutting fingers
is for apology.

Like, I'm sorry,
here's my finger?

Every time you look, you
remember what you've done.

You know, in Japanese, we say,

(SPEAKING IN A
FOREIGN LANGUAGE).

Not saying is the flower.

What does that mean?

It means shut up.

My brother, Frank tried
to cut his finger off

once when we were kids.

He said he wanted a wound.

You never say anything
about your family.

I don't have a family.

Everybody has a family.

How about your father?

MARGARET: Gone.

Left.

Ages ago.

Mother?

Cancer.

Last year.

And your brother?

He hears voices in his head,

telling him to do things.

Do you love her?

Do you?

I feel like
loyalty, guilty, duty.

MARGARET: How romantic.

It's not exciting
kind of love, but love.

Look, you cannot be
alone in this world,

even if you want to be.

You have to think
about other people,

like a family,
people who become...

Look, not speaking is,
what is it?

I don't remember
what you've said.

A flower.

A flower.

Not speaking is the flower.

Shut up.

(SENSUAL MUSIC)

Why this?

It's the only thing
that turns me on.

<i>And so it begins.</i>

<i>This sore, shrieking something,</i>

<i>is it nothing or everything?</i>

<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

<i>It's yours.</i>

<i>It's you.</i>

Tell me about the word cunt.

Well, in Scotland,
we use it all the time.

Really?

Yeah.

I mean, in America, it's
the worst thing you can say.

It's bad.

Yeah, it's really bad.

But over in Scotland, I
could call my friends a cunt.

But honestly, you could
use it for anything.

Welcome.

Could you call
your mom a cunt?

Definitely not.

And if I called my mom a cunt,
you'd never see her again.

Would you call a child a cunt?

No.

Oh sorry, that's ridiculous.

I know, for
instance, you'd call,

look at the state of that cunt.

Like look at the state of you,

or you made a right cunt of us,

so you really fucked it up.

Really Shakespearian cunt.

So we have
Shakespeare to blame.

I would.

But if you ever
said anything...

Louise.

Hi.

How are you?

Good, I missed you.

I missed you too.

This place is so
cool, I love it.

Louise, this is Margaret.

Hi.

Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

Liam has told me
so much about you.

That's crazy because he
has not even mentioned you.

Liam tells me that
you teach English.

I pronounce
English to a class.

Louise is a doctor.

I'm not a medical doctor,

but yeah, I'm getting
my PhD in linguistics.

Wow.

That's crazy.

This is Louise.

Hi, so nice to meet you.

(PHONE RINGING)

Sorry you guys, sorry
I have to take this.

Mom, hi, can you hold
on for one second.

Yeah.

Liam is attempting
to bring a third party

into this situation.

Maybe he should be convicted?

Are you two jealous?

No, we're really,
really happy for you,

and that really smart
girl from high school.

Marg, you're being a cunt.

And you know you are.

MARGARET: I'm not.

Yes, you are.

Oh my God, you guys, I'm
literally freaking out,

my sister is, she's pregnant!

Oh, congratulations!

Can you imagine
having sex with Liam?

He's actually kind
of sweet, look at him.

We could both do worse,
we have done worse.

That's true.

Be nice.

So, how did you two meet?

Hi.

Hey.

This isn't much.

Socks, thank you.

That's so sweet.

Today, we take a train.

Where?

Can I have your day?

The whole day?

Yes.

Can we do it tomorrow?

Has to be today.

Okay.

Look how good that
looks, it looks great.

Is that, that's your mother.

Yeah.

And that's you?

And that's me and my sister.

Oh my God.

We celebrate our ceremony,
we have this Japanese armor.

Oh my God, is that your mom?

She looks like a movie star.

No, she's a housewife.

She left?

Yeah.

What did your father do?

Is that him?

Yeah.

My father is, he runs
a family business.

Okay.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

I have another gift for you.

I want to show you
a place, called

(SPEAKING IN A
FOREIGN LANGUAGE).

Buddha's room.

They say that here
you can be reborn

and let go of your past.

(TENDER MUSIC)

Congratulations.

Congratulations on what?

Today's your birthday.

No, it's not.

You don't feel it?

Today you're born.

What are you talking about?

Oh, so today's
your birthday too.

Yeah.

(TRAIN ANNOUNCER SPEAKING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

I've been here
now for three years.

I look forward to meeting
each and every one of you.

What's your name?

SUZAN: My name is Suzan.

Hi, Suzan, nice to meet you.

And you are?

MAO: My name is Mao Hatakura.

TEACHER: Hi, Mao,
nice to meet you.

STUDENT: My name
is Saruna Takashi.

TEACHER: Hi, Saruna,
nice to meet you.

This is your final pay.

I'm sorry, but I didn't.

There are
consequences, Margaret.

I let you down, I know.

No, you let the girls down.

I can do better.

I know you can.

But not here.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

I'm leaving.

Now?

What now, I mean,
I'm leaving Japan.

You're coming back, right?

Of course you're
not coming back.

Everything goes away.

Nothing lasts.

I get it.

Get enough to fucking make it.

(TENDER MUSIC)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Well.

That's it for me.

If I have another one,

they won't let me on the flight.

How did you know
that I was one of you?

Why didn't you give me the look?

The look?

Yeah.

Why didn't I
give you the look,

you know, because there's
two kinds of people.

There's the regular people.

And there's the ones that
were raised by wolves.

Could you tell?

Oh yeah.

You came in here
howling at the Moon.

(TRAIN RUSTLING)

Kazu.

Kazu.

Kazu.

Kazu!

Kazu!

Kazu.

Hi.

This isn't good for you.

What isn't?

Me!

It could be your
dirty little secret.

Fine.

I saw you with your family.

Listen, I am in charge.

I love you.

I love you.

Say that again.

I love you.

Say that again.

I love you.

I love you.

I love you.


I love you.

I love you.

I love you.

I love you.

This job isn't for everybody.

Does it pay cash?

Yeah.

Great, when can I start?


(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Show me your titty!

I'll have one more.

Hi.

Is this too much for you?

No.

Then, please.

(LIVELY MUSIC)

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Margaret?

Hi, it's Louise.

Interest in linguistics.

LOUISE: Yes.

Right.

How are you?

I'm good.

Are you okay?

I'm fine, yeah.

Are you still with Liam?

Liam got deported.

You didn't know that?

His visa ran out ages ago,

but you know, Liam.

But he's okay, we're
actually gonna meet up

in Thailand in a month.

That's really good.

Tell him hi from me.

I will.

Can I take you to breakfast?

And we do this just like,

okay, not the cappuccino.

Oh my God, this is literally
my version of heaven right now.

Do you ever get homesick?

I get bar sick.

Like people really want to be,

and all of a sudden
they want to be home.

But I really want to
be far away from home

all of a sudden and then I go.

You know there's
actually a word for that.

Yeah?

Fernweh.

Fernweh is a longing for
distance, just pure distance.

Do you know what (SPEAKING
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) means?

No.

Means sobering up
by drinking more.

Hey.

(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

I like to be submissive,
do you know what that means?

Get undressed.

Lie on the bed.

Face down.

Left hand.

Good.

It doesn't make you
special or interesting

that you like this.

I know.

I like this
presence, the hotels.

I do too.

Nobody uses their public
face in these places.

We shouldn't use (SPEAKING
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE),

the public face.

The mask.

When I was a kid, I
used to come here.

With your girlfriend?

She wasn't my girlfriend,
but she came here

with me.

So you got to see
her without the mask.

Sometimes the mask is prettier
than the thing behind it.

I could kill you now.

Please do.

Please do.

Do it.

(DOOR BANGING)

Is this really you?

Yes.

You followed me.

Yes.

You're a coward.

It's okay.

It's okay.

<i>I just wanted to say
