<i>Welcome, brethren.</i>

<i>I am Father Isiah Russ.</i>

<i>Of the Church</i>
<i>of the Enchanted Saints.</i>

<i>Today we will be speaking...</i>

<i>of the inner turmoil</i>
<i>that plagues us all.</i>

<i>The deep-seated trauma</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

<i>The only way</i>
<i>to release yourself...</i>

<i>from the trauma</i>

<i>and ascend</i>
<i>into the light...</i>

<i>is to remember.</i>

<i>There are two psyches.</i>

<i>There is the divine psyche.</i>

<i>And the conscious psyche.</i>

<i>This meat. This flesh.</i>

<i>This is not you.</i>

<i>This is not--</i>

<i>this is not you!</i>

<i>Within you</i>
<i>there is the divine.</i>

<i>Melding those</i>
<i>is the only way</i>

<i>you can ascend.</i>

<i>Ascend and touch the pure</i>

<i>and perfect being...</i>

<i>that is above.</i>

Why don't you get some perfume
before we meet up again?

Excuse me?

You need to get some perfume
before we meet.

How charming.
Are you implying that I smell?

Listen Ruby, I'm not saying
that you smell bad.

Or that you smell good,
but...

just, you smell like
you've been

with four other men tonight.

I have been
with four other men tonight.

Exactly.

I don't need to go home
to the old ball and chain,

smelling like four other
filthy fucking bastards.

Duffy, you are one of those
filthy bastards.

Listen, you gotta get this shit,
it's called Rose Summer?

It's what my wife uses.

It's not Chanel...

-but it'll mask the stench of--
-Stench?

Odor?

Whatever.
Fuck you, Duffy.

Not 'til you get that perfume,
my dear.

Ruby!

-Zoey, hi!
-Hi!

How are you doing, baby?

Oh, I'm just peachy.

-That bad, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

Come here. Let's go out.

No.
I'm gonna call it a night.

-Okay.
-I'm going to bed.

-Okay. Get home safely.
-I will.

Good night, Zoey!

<i>...the colors...</i>

<i>Medical strike continues,</i>

<i>as the state seemingly ignores</i>
<i>the pleas of hundreds,</i>

<i>after major cuts</i>
<i>from last quarter.</i>

<i>Three of the four</i>
<i>local hospitals</i>

<i>are now temporarily closed</i>
<i>due to lack of staff,</i>

<i>leaving Metro West</i>

<i>as the only</i>
<i>operational facility.</i>

<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was left mid-renovation</i>

<i>after those cuts,</i>

<i>so many residents</i>
<i>are filling in</i>

<i>on a voluntary basis</i>
<i>in the meantime.</i>

<i>If you're a woman,</i>

<i>you know what it means</i>
<i>to be needed.</i>

<i>...down, down, always down.</i>
<i>Never up, down.</i>

<i>â™ª Golly, but you're pretty,</i>
<i>yump-dee-dumpty-ditty â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just wait and see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're gonna be</i>
<i>the sweetest one of all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hail, hail the queen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hail</i>
<i>the cookie queen! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hail, hail the queen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All hail the queen â™ª</i>

<i>Ooh!</i>

<i>Repentance.</i>

<i>Repentance, my children...</i>

<i>is not simply...</i>

<i>looking to the Lord,</i>
<i>our God...</i>

<i>and the cosmos above.</i>

<i>But it is kneeling...</i>

<i>to your cosmic...</i>

<i>prophet,</i>

<i>when you are broken.</i>

<i>For it says...</i>

<i>in the original scripture...</i>

<i>"If thine hand...</i>

<i>offended thee.</i>

<i>Take a rough stone</i>

<i>and split</i>
<i>from your wrist.</i>

<i>For it is better...</i>

<i>to walk into</i>

<i>the cloudy gates of heaven...</i>

<i>with a stump...</i>

<i>than to slip into</i>

<i>the magma pits of hell...</i>

<i>with both hands."</i>

<i>â™ª The written word</i>
<i>is still the same â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Pray for it</i>
<i>in all our days â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's okay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª God of all</i>
<i>of your free days â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You could think of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lonely,</i>
<i>I could only see myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's okay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Maybe</i>
<i>you can find your way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All around me</i>
<i>they â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Think they've changed</i>
<i>but it's still the same â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's okay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª God of all your clichÃ©s â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You could think of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lonely,</i>
<i>I could only see myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's okay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Maybe</i>
<i>you can find your way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They will gladly</i>
<i>sell you lies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You can't cry</i>
<i>if you don't have eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I was a tear,</i>
<i>I would cry forever â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come too near â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll make it</i>
<i>through December â™ª</i>

<i>What do you say, Cookie?</i>

<i>What do you say,</i>
<i>play a little hooky?</i>

<i>You little cutie pie.</i>

Oh, baby.

<i>In my travels,</i>
<i>through the globe...</i>

<i>beyond and within.</i>

<i>I was came upon</i>
<i>by an angel.</i>

<i>Who spoke to me</i>
<i>of the truths.</i>

<i>And these truths</i>

<i>cannot be denied</i>
<i>nor unproven.</i>

<i>And they are thus...</i>

<i>the spirits...</i>

<i>the gods, the demons...</i>

<i>everything you read about</i>
<i>in the Bible...</i>

<i>is from a cosmic war</i>
<i>that's going on all around us.</i>

<i>God is an extraterrestrial.</i>

<i>And what we are not seeing...</i>

<i>is that</i>
<i>he's an interdimensional</i>

<i>warrior</i>

<i>that travels</i>
<i>through time...</i>

<i>and dimensions...</i>

<i>to reach us.</i>

<i>But our eyes are closed.</i>

<i>We cannot see him.</i>

<i>There is no way</i>
<i>we can enter heaven.</i>

<i>The only way</i>

<i>we can ascend</i>
<i>the spiritual plane,</i>

<i>is by total and pure...</i>

What are you doing?

Uh, n-- nothing.

<i>And become</i>
<i>the perfect being...</i>

<i>...of spiritual</i>

<i>and mental toughness.</i>

<i>And at the top</i>
<i>of the pyramid...</i>

<i>there lies...</i>

It's for you.

Hello.

Okay. Thank you.

I have to go.

Someone's waiting for me.

Hello, Ruby.

Uh, hi.

Did I frighten you?

Yes.

I'm-- I'm sure
it's not the first time.

I'm-- I'm sorry,
do I know you?

Not yet.

Are you the one
that's been waiting for me?

Oh, yes.

We've been waiting
quite some time for you.

We?

Ruby!

What the hell
are you doing out here?

I've been waiting for you
in the room.

I was just talking to--

He was here.
He knew my name.

-Who?
-This-- this guy.

Are you fucking with me
right now?

No, I'm serious.

Right.

Hey, did you get that perfume
I asked you to get?

What?

Uh, yeah, I got it.

-Rose Summer?
-Yes Duffy. Rose Summer.

Perfect.

And I got that coke
that you wanted.

I did not ask for that.

Well, yeah,
well, I've got it.

And we're going to
do it tonight.

Duffy. No.

Listen,
I come to you to do the shit

that I'm not allowed
to do at home.

So tonight,
we're going to do the shit

that I'm not allowed
to do at home.

Come on, my wife
would fucking kill me

if she knew
I was doing this shit.

And she certainly
wouldn't do any of it with me.

So, I guess
that leaves you.

Ruby.

I don't know.

It's been a strange day
already.

You just need
a little pick me up.

Pay me double.

Sure, that works.

Fine.

All right,
that's what I'm talking about.

Come here.

Ruby! Ruby, wake up.

Fuck! Fuck! Ruby!

Ruby! God--
God fucking dammit!

Wake up!

Shit, shit, shit, shit.

Can you hear me?

You're at Metro West Hospital.

You're very badly injured.

You almost didn't make it.

We were able
to remove the rebar.

It missed
all your vital organs.

There was some damage
to your small intestine.

You also have
an orbital fracture

in your face.

We were able to remove
all the grass shards,

stitch you up
and clean your wounds.

It's gonna take
a couple months to heal.

It's going to be okay.

But I think for now,

I should probably let you
get some rest and recover.

Okay.

Um, excuse me.

Typical street whore.

Probably got
the shit kicked out of her

by her pimp.

Listen, bandage her up,
get her out of here.

Don't--
no special treatment.

We don't need more of them
on the street.

Excuse me?

What the fuck
did you just say?

I'm sorry, ma'am,
this, uh--

this doesn't concern you.

Actually, it fucking does.

That's my fucking friend
in there.

Ma'am,
visiting hours are over.

And I suggest
that you leave.

You know,
you look really familiar.

I probably
busted you before.

Nah. That ain't it.

I don't forget
the pigs that bust me.

I'll remember.

Listen, just bandage her up,
get her out of here.

"Our Father...

who art in cosmic heaven.

Hallowed be
thy astronomical name.

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done...

as it is
on this earthly plane."

Hey, um, hi.

Hi, uh, your--
your name's Roy, right?

Yeah. Hi.

Hi, I'm-- I'm Zoe.

Um, I'm a friend of Ruby's.
You know Ruby?

"Lead us not...

to dimensional...

transformative...

temptation."

Okay, well, she's in there
and she is hurt really bad,

and they won't tell me
anything.

And there's this fucking cop,

and he's being
such a fucking prick,

and they won't let me know
if she's alive.

They won't let me know
if know she's dead.

I just want to know

that my friend
is going to be okay,

and I don't know anything.

"Yours is the kingdom
and the power...

of glory.

Forever and ever.

Amen."

Okay. It's okay.
Hey, uh, I-- I work here.

I-- I'm a nurse, uh,
and if-- if Ruby's in there,

I'll-- I'll find her.

Okay?

Uh, everything's
gonna be all right.

-All right?
-Okay. Thank you.

Who-- who are you?

Oh.

You're awake.

I am Father Isiah Ross.

Oh...

I've seen you on TV.

Yes?

Are you a subscriber
to my video series?

No.

Oh.

Okay. That's okay.

Are you in pain?

My dear.

Hmm...

This should take
the edge off...

a bit.

Anyway...

what is your name,
my child?

Ruby.

Do you believe...

in the Lord Almighty, Ruby?

I'm sorry.

Why are you here?

I have been sent...

by the cosmic Father...

to do his divine bidding.

Something
brought me to you.

Because I knew...

that you are in great pain
and you needed...

salvation.

A savior.

And here I am.

Yeah, well...

I think the doctors
have that handled.

Something haunts you.

Am I right?

Tell me what torments you,
Ruby?

Right now, it's you.

You're tormenting me.

I'm just here to help.

Now...

tell me, Ruby...

how did you end up here?

Horrible men put me here.

Is that a fact?

Yes.

Fragile...

pathetic egos.

Just like yours.

So...

it's masculinity
that traumatizes you.

Tell me, Ruby,
have you ever heard...

the concept...

of the conscious

and the divine psyche?

No.

Well...

it's...

a little thing
I picked up...

through my divine travels...

through
this earthly dimension.

You see...

humans are of two

separate minds.

In one, the conscious.

This holds our weakness.

Our suffering...

our trauma.

And it keeps us...

it clouds us...

from moving past...

and inheriting...

the pure divine light.

Reaching
our full human potential.

And then,

there is the divine psyche.

Like a perfect computer.

And it's this earthly form...

that keeps us,
holds us back...

from achieving

unlimited power
and potential.

The only way...

to combine these two...

is to relive your trauma.

Feel it again.

Bear it.

That's the only way...

anyone can ascend.

Do you understand, Ruby?

No.

It's okay.

You will.

I know you're a whore.

Do you know, Ruby...

what the book of Leviticus

says about whores?

No.

It says

they shall be burned

to death.

And as much...

as I love

a good cleansing
by fire...

I have great faith

in my own healing techniques.

Because even...

a man of the cloth...

must give in...

to temptation.

Good morning, kitty.

Thank you
for watching over me.

How did we get home?

Hmm?

How long was I out for?

Hello?

<i>Hey, it's Roy.</i>

Come on up.

This happened on Tuesday?

Yes.
You were with me that night.

Don't you think
you would have noticed?

I don't know.

It wasn't covered
with makeup or something?

-You don't believe me?
-It's not that.

It's just that
it doesn't make any sense.

It's medically impossible.

These wounds
are completely healed.

From the look of it,
these scars could be years old.

It's a miracle.

That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

Something weird
is going on, Roy.

Something really weird.

Ruby,
do you believe in God?

No.

Not really.

Well, if you ask me,

there's only
one explanation for this.

It's a miracle from God.

Hey, cute cat.

Dear God.

Or Lord.

I don't know
what to call you.

But if you are real...

if you are listening...

maybe you could help me.

Is this what
I'm supposed to do?

Why is this happening?

Why is this
happening to me?

Is this a part
of your plan?

Am I supposed
to understand this?

Are you even listening?

Please, God.

Just show me.

Give me
some sort of sign.

Who are you?

<i>I am.</i>

What do you want?

<i>We want you, Ruby.</i>

Why me?

<i>Have you ever experienced</i>

<i>the sweet taste</i>

<i>of someone else's blood?</i>

Oh, God.

Help me.

<i>God cannot hear you.</i>

<i>God does not love you.</i>

<i>God doesn't even know</i>

<i>you exist.</i>

Are you going to
kill me?

<i>We do not want</i>
<i>to kill you, Ruby.</i>

<i>We cannot make you</i>
<i>a martyr.</i>

<i>If you were to die,</i>

<i>these people</i>
<i>would not care.</i>

<i>They would simply see</i>

<i>a dead harlot.</i>

<i>Another young girl</i>

<i>abused and forgotten</i>

<i>by the patriarchy.</i>

<i>And that does not fulfill</i>

<i>our purpose.</i>

<i>We need you, Ruby.</i>

<i>You are one of us.</i>

Who?

<i>Calms the nerves...</i>

<i>Good morning.</i>

<i>And now,</i>
<i>we have a very special</i>

<i>video presentation</i>

<i>for this city's</i>
<i>number one whore.</i>

<i>That's right, Ruby.</i>
<i>We're looking at you.</i>

<i>Tell 'em your name.</i>

<i>Speak. Speak, pig.</i>

<i>My name's Officer</i>
<i>William Duffy.</i>

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who these people are.</i>

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what they want.</i>

<i>Piggy, piggy, piggy.</i>
<i>- Please, help.</i>

<i>Help me! Help!</i>

<i>They want you dead, fucker.</i>

<i>Fucker, fucking dead. Dead!</i>

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>Now, that's what I call</i>
<i>a pig roast.</i>

Pick up.

Hey, it's Ruby.

Listen, do you still
want to get out of here?

Ruby, it's me, it's Roy.

It's Roy.

We got to go.
We got to go.

We gotta
get out of here.

So, you want to
tell me what's going on?

Have I completely
lost my mind?

Are you in some
sort of trouble?

It just
doesn't make any sense to me.

Yeah, I'm, uh,
starting to feel the same way.

Ruby, will you please,

just tell me
what the hell is going on?

These--

these people...

they're following me.

Stalkers?

No.

Strangers.

Only...

they seem to know my name.

Well, what do they want
from you?

Do--

do they want money?

'Cause I've--
I've got money.

And you're more
than welcome

to-- to have it.

There was something else
in the room that night.

What? In our room?

I saw him.

He was there.

And then last night...

he came to me again.

I couldn't move.

I tried.

But it was as if...

I was being held down
by something.

I could barely breathe.

It felt like someone
was sitting on my chest.

And he just appeared.

He came out of the shadows.

My God.

That's terrifying.

It talked to me.

It talked to you?

He said they wanted me.

He said that
I was one of them.

What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

Need you for what?

I don't know.
One of who?

I don't know.

But they killed Duffy.

Who?

Duffy.

He was a client of mine.

Oh, you mean
that asshole cop?

He was a client of yours?

You knew him?

Uh, kind of.

I-- I knew--
I know his wife.

She's a great doctor.

Man, that guy's
a real piece of work.

Uh, I mean,
no disrespect, but, like...

sometimes you get
what you deserve.

She saved my life.

No.

He saved your life,
Ruby.

Now, don't do anything
you're going to regret, Ruby.

You know, this is
a big opportunity for you.

This could change
your whole life.

He can save you.

He saved us all.

He saved us,
all right.

You know,
it's true what they say.

He works
in mysterious ways.

And you may not understand it,
but it's what's best.

He's got all of our
best interests in mind.

It's scary.

Growth is hard.

You don't have a choice.

<i>So, our sweet little Ruby</i>

<i>has returned.</i>

<i>Your cunning attempt</i>
<i>to escape us</i>

<i>is so very disappointing.</i>

Why did you kill Duffy?

<i>It was our</i>
<i>will that he should suffer.</i>

<i>Besides,</i>

<i>have you not entertained</i>
<i>the notion yourself?</i>

<i>Eliminating</i>
<i>the thorn in your side?</i>

<i>A pain that you're now</i>
<i>quite familiar with?</i>

Sure, he was an asshole.

But I wasn't going to
kill him.

<i>Oh, Ruby.</i>

<i>We simply</i>
<i>released his spirit</i>

<i>from this earthly plane.</i>

Where's Roy?

<i>There's no</i>
<i>need to worry about Roy.</i>

<i>He's in highly capable hands.</i>

So, what?

You're going to
kill him, too?

<i>That is yet to be decided.</i>

He didn't do anything.

<i>Consider him as collateral.</i>

<i>You, Ruby,</i>

<i>are our investment.</i>

<i>You attract</i>
<i>the transgressors,</i>

<i>and we deal with them</i>
<i>as we see fit.</i>

And what am I supposed
to do?

<i>All you have to do</i>

<i>is prevail.</i>

<i>Your presence</i>

<i>is our existence.</i>

<i>And from us,</i>

<i>your life receives</i>
<i>a purpose.</i>

And what
if I don't want to?

<i>Well,</i>

<i>that would be unacceptable.</i>

<i>Do you not understand,</i>
<i>Ruby?</i>

<i>We are your anti-saviors.</i>

<i>Your anti-Christ,</i>

<i>anti-heroes.</i>

<i>And if you are not with us,</i>

<i>then you are against us.</i>

<i>Hey, uh, it's Roy.</i>

<i>I'm not in right now,</i>
<i>so just--</i>

Hey, it's Ruby.

Could you meet me
somewhere?

Let's go, boys.

Thank you
for meeting me here, Zoey.

I didn't know
where else to go.

Oh, honey,
I'm so worried about you.

It's totally okay.

I can't believe you're out
of the hospital already.

-Yeah. I can't either.
-Come in.

So, this is going to
sound a little crazy,

but I have to tell you
what's been going on.

Brothers, sisters...

followers.

There are demons
among us.

You can't see them...

with these,

these human eyes.

For they travel

through dimensions

using gravitrons.

You cannot sense them,

but they are there!

They are always there

watching, tasting the...

spit that comes
from your mouth.

Can I help you,
brother?

We have a...

sermon happening here.

Is there anything
I can help you with?

I just wanted to see
where the magic was made.

Well,
now you've seen it.

You can go.

I'm sorry,
my friends want to see

where the magic is made,
too.

Come on.

Hey, hey, hey, now.

Uh, if this is about
the councilman's daughter,

I can assure you,
we settled that out of court.

Oh, no, no.

We're friends of Ruby's.

Oh, shit.

So, who the fuck
are these psychos?

I've either
lost my goddamn mind,

or they really are some
sadistic cult from hell.

You think they're demons?

I don't know.

I don't really believe
in that stuff.

But you believe in hell.

What if this is hell,
Zoey?

You're serious.

Fuck.

What if I really
did die the other night?

No, no. No, no.
You're right here with me.

I just don't know
what to do, Zoey.

Oh, okay.
It's okay.

-It's going to be okay.
-I don't know what to do.

It's going to be okay.

All right.

Face down, on the bed, ladies.
What the fuck?

Face down
onto the fucking bed now.

Dammit.

God!
Stay fucking still.

Ruby?

Some fucking friends you got,
you know what I mean?

Stay still.

This will all be over.

Don't fucking move.

Don't fucking move.

Fucking--

This ain't nothing personal,
Ruby.

It's just a little
added security measure.

Now, give me your wrist.

Give me your wrist.

Give me your fucking wrist
right now.

This will all
be over soon.

For you.

There we go.

Don't move.
Be right back.

<i>Welcome, Ruby.</i>

<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>you are our master</i>

<i>of ceremonies.</i>

<i>Please, rise.</i>

<i>Reveal our sacrifice.</i>

<i>Crucify him.</i>

<i>He must die</i>
<i>for his sins.</i>

I can't.

<i>If you cannot</i>
<i>punish your transgressor...</i>

<i>then we will be forced</i>

<i>to punish your allies.</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh.

This one
didn't make it.

<i>What a shame.</i>

You sick fucks.

You told me
I didn't have to do anything.

<i>I lied.</i>

<i>Now, unless you wish</i>

<i>the same fate upon Roy,</i>

<i>I suggest you obey us.</i>

<i>Wonderful.</i>

<i>Now, do you remember</i>

<i>what he said on television</i>

<i>the first time you saw him?</i>

No.

<i>Well, he recited</i>

<i>quite a lovely passage</i>

<i>about dismembering</i>
<i>body parts</i>

<i>that cause you to sin.</i>

No!

<i>I highly doubt</i>

<i>that he will make it</i>
<i>into heaven</i>

<i>with those disgraceful</i>
<i>genitals intact.</i>

I don't forgive you,
Father.

It's done.
Now, let us go.

<i>Oh, Ruby.</i>

<i>You can never leave.</i>

<i>You are truly</i>

<i>one of us.</i>

Then let Roy go.

<i>No.</i>

<i>Roy is just as guilty</i>
<i>as the rest.</i>

We had a deal.

<i>No, Ruby.</i>

<i>You never even had</i>
<i>a choice.</i>

Let us go.

Let him go, God damn it.

<i>Ruby, I'm afraid</i>

<i>you just don't understand.</i>

<i>The Lord giveth,</i>

<i>and the Lord taketh away.</i>

<i>Behold.</i>

<i>I am making</i>

<i>all things new.</i>

<i>Though your beginning</i>

<i>was insignificant,</i>

<i>yet, your end</i>

<i>shall increase greatly.</i>
