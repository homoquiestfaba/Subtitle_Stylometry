If we are silent,
His enemy will draw near.

Back to the base,
Collect his soldiers.

What for?
At least that's what we can do.

Civilians? They
Will destroy it.

Why?
Just do my commands.

Anything can be there.

Okay, we check the part
That part. On the other side.

Maybe 3 hours.

Put pressure on it.
Clean out the blood.

Conditions are bad.

We have to go back.

We've gone this far.

What is our ship?

Right, we're going there.

No, we have to get ready,
There may be survivors.

If we do that, we must
Save ourselves.

I'm going up, looking
Whether they have come.

They almost arrived.

Calm down. We'll be back, right?

Yes, but how long?

That's them!

Sailing in a few hours.

A few hours? Why are you back?

I do not have anything, because
That's me not so go.

Seriously!

How's it going, Collins?

His plane crashed.

No.

It's because of the engine,
the engine is dead.

No ships.

Dad, come on, no boats!

Maybe he's dead.
Be quiet! I heard you!

Do not be noisy, shut up!

Maybe we can help him.

Do not! They do not know
We are in here.

Why are they shooting at us?

We must hide.

Tommy, you can do this.

Where are you?

They're coming ..

How to?

Come on. Hurry up.

How do we get out of here?

We have to open this place.

Wait! We have to wait.

Wait. Wait.
Yes.

Someone ... Somebody has to get out.

Who wants to volunteer?

I do not need volunteers.

I need someone who is brave.

You're the one who goes up.

He's a German spy. Let him alone.

He's a spy and we're not
Telling him who he is.

Do you agree?

You do not speak English.

If he survived to
Germany, we will be finished.

Certain. Tell him.

Yes.

Tell me.

Tell me, Gibson.

Tell me!

For God's sake, just let me know.

Austin, he's with Austin.

Shit.

Shit.

Damn coward.

It belongs to Gibson, is not it?

It belongs to British soldiers
Who is brave, not yours.

It is not worthy of your use.

He's my friend.

Maybe he killed him.

He ... he did not kill him.

How do we know?

How difficult is it to find a corpse
British soldiers on the beach?

He did not kill anyone.
He's just like all of us.

I think he gave
Code to them.

Try all sorts,
And I'll shoot.

This ship is still drowning.

Correct.

We must trust each other.

When we get out of here
I will interrogate you.

Hurry up.

Come up.

I will not hesitate.

It represents thousands of people.

Shit.

He sent something to Lars.

I knew it.

Somebody has to get out
So we can all live.

Do you know what that means?

No. I do not know.

This is the price of lies.

I'll go with

Hurry up.

With or without me
Will make a lot of difference.

Of course, if you continue to defend him
I also do not hesitate to shoot you.

Hurry up.

You are stupid.
