[on phone]:
Mom. No, I swear.

I am at the library studying.

Hmm-mm.

â™ª I gotta lot of problems I-- â™ª

Yeah, for my physics test.

I would never lie to you.

Okay, Mom, do not use LIT.

You are like
a million years old.

Jell-O shots? Jell-O shots?

Yeah, got to go.
Love you, bye.

Jell-O shot?
Thanks, Pledge.

Zoe.

I do not care.

I'm so going to fail physics.

[thump]
[Zoe gasps]

<i> ZOE: Ah! Oh, oh, my God.</i>

<i> Are you okay?</i>

[Charise groaning]

â™ª It doesn't really matter
What we do â™ª

<i> Can someone
</i>get a first aid kit?

[song playing in background]

<i> Does this mean we have
</i>to cancel the party?

[song playing in background]

<i> - [Ashley on phone]:
</i>Ladies, it's Ashley, obviously.

<i> Congratulations
</i>on being selected.

<i> I am so excited.</i>

<i> You're the first pledge class
</i>since the renovation.

<i> So, come to the house
</i>and celebrate.

<i> 7:00 PM tonight.
</i>Don't be late.

â™ª It's so cold in-- â™ª

So are you like-- are you sure
you want to do this?

Because I mean, yeah,
there are so many pluses

to joining a sorority,

like parties and friends
and... parties,

but I mean,
that's so much time involved.

We can be spending that time
doing better things

like-- like studying...
or napping. [chuckles]

This is something
I have to do.

I made a promise.

Thank you so much
for coming with me though.

I know it's
not really your thing.

No. Are you kidding me?

I mean, what could be better
than living in a house

full of 30 girls?

Eventually, all of our periods
are going to sync up,

and then it will be one big
'Game of Thrones',

red wedding up in there.

But yeah, I can't wait.

[phone notification]
Oh.

[message on mobile phone]:
WELCOME TO KAPPA KAPPA PHI

NEW RULES AT KAPPA KAPPA PHI.
YOU LIE, YOU DIE

Hey, wait up.

[loud party music]

CARLY: Welcome, bitches,

to the hallowed halls
of Kappa Kappa Phi.

Think of this less like
a sorority house

and more like
your boyfriend's house.

'Cause for the next couple days,
your ass is mine.

Okay, well, what I think
Carly's trying to say

is welcome to Kappa Kappa Phi,
pledge class of 2020.

[applause]
Yay!

Wait. Where's the party?

[chuckles]
You're at it, girlfriend.

I think she means the rager
down the street at Omega Thi.

Oh, yeah. No, you won't be
making it to that.

We will. You won't.

Ah, this is a cleaning party.

Yay! Cleaning! Whoo!

Yay!
Yay!

Tonight?

Yes. Tonight, Maxine.

And just for that eye roll,
you get toilets... with this.

Why?

For not knowing
the significance of this night.

Do any of you know
the significance of this night?

Um, Friday?

Shauna, school them.

It's the night of the fire.

Two years ago, tonight.

That's right, Shauna.

It's hard to believe
the rest of you could forget.

We lost a sister that night.

And your fellow pledge, Shauna,
lost her actual sister.

It was the worst night
of my life. [tearful sigh]

And I'm sure
it was bad for you too.

By the way,
dying is not supposed to be

a part of the Kappa Kappa Phi
experience, okay?

Didn't another girl
like die here last month too?

That was
a total accident, okay?

Charise couldn't take
three steps without slipping.

R.I.P.

Laura, however, died a hero.

We are going to
clean this house.

So, what are you good at?

A-ah, organizing.

Perfect. Someone just puked
in the kitchen sink,

so I need you to go organize
that out of the house.

Eww.

And Shauna, because of
what happened with your sister,

you can pick
whatever job you want.

Just name it.

I'll pick toilets, too.

That is exactly the answer
your sister would have given.

Commitment. Loyalty.

These are the tenets
of sisterhood.

And what is
the most important quality

of a sister in Kappa Kappa Phi?

ALL: Honesty.
Honesty.

Nailed it. Okay.
You guys get to cleaning

and I'll see you Cinderellas
at the ball.

Whoo!
[shrieks] Oh, my God.

After you.

Clean, clean, clean.

What a sad pledge turnout.

Yeah. Well, two funerals
is terrible PR.

SHAUNA:
Oh. Oh, this is so nasty.

Thank you by the way,

for volunteering
to do this with me.

Yeah, it's what sisters
do for each other, right?

Loyalty.

Yeah. Okay.

[toilet flushes]
MAXINE: Ooh!

SHAUNA: Oh, God.

MAXINE: Eww.

Ah.
So, loyalty.

Is that why you joined
the sorority

that your sister died in?

'Cause, not going to lie,
that's-- it's low-key creepy.

Like I said before,

you know I made a promise to her
before she died.

And I don't know, I guess
I think it'll help with closure.

That is so heartwarming.

But can we like
not talk about that?

The past is the past.

Now finish scrubbing the toilet.

The basement
isn't going to clean itself.

Bye.

My God. She's such--

A bitch. Oh, my God.

[both chuckle]

[thrilling music]

I kind of wish there were
more toilets to clean.

We're going to be here
all night.

I know.
It must be from the fire.

I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
LOVE, IGGY

<i> VOICE: [whispers]:
</i>Kappa Kappa Phi must die.

[door creaking]

Did you hear that?

<i> VOICE: [whispers]
</i>Kappa Kappa Phi must die.

Kappa Kappa Phi must die!

[Maxine screams]

Oh, my God. Guys! Guys!

SHAUNA: Billyumz.
Shauna, you've got some balls.

You want to see mine?

Hmm, hmm.

What?

Oh my God!
Guys! Guys! Guys!

In the basement--
in the basement.

There is-- there's a man
downstairs in the basement,

naked with a knife.

Oh, my God.

Are you sure?
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

Can you describe him?

Or at least,
can you describe his dick?

Like, was it big?
Like, how big?

Like this big, or this big?

F you both.

[Ashley chortles]

It was Billyumz.

It was just a prank, Max.

They're just trying to scare us.

CARLY:
Well, look who blew in.

Am I late?

Are you a part
of this sorority or not?

I... [clears throat]
was with Brad Bender and--

Brad Bender?

You were having sex with
Fortnite champion Brad Bender?

I swear. Brad Bender.

You know that honesty
is the main tenet

of Kappa Kappa Phi.

There will be consequences
if you're lying.

[church organ playing]

I swear... on the sisterhood
of Kappa Kappa Phi,

I was having sex
with Brad Bender.

Do that on your own time,
Tulsi.

We have a new pledge class.

Show them whether
you're in this house or out

because
you can't be both, right?

You know what?
As punishment, Tulsi,

you should probably
take the attic, to clean.

Do I look like a pledge?

You look like a sister,

and these pledges
need your shining example.

[Tulsi exhales]

Oh, my God,
let me help you with those.

Thank you.

[Shauna sighs]

[door hinges creak]

Ah, this cleaning party sucks.

I'm not going to lie.

Hello?

<i> VOICE: [whispers]
</i>You lie, you die.

[clatter]
Okay. This isn't funny.

Th-these girls really got
a stick up their butt

about honesty, huh?

Yeah.
You lie, you die, right?

<i> VOICE: [whispers]
</i>You lie, you die.

Seriously. Stop.



What do you mean,
you lie, you die?

The text... that we all got
when we arrived,

from an unknown caller?

I never got a text.

[Tulsi choking]

You didn't get a text saying,
"You lie, you die"?

No, but that sounds like
50 Shades of Creepy.

[Tulsi choking]

<i> NINA: I guess I'm just
</i>not important enough

<i> to make the list.</i>

I'm so not going to get in.

What?

I'm going to have to rush
Theta Pi. Ah!

No, you're not.
You will be fine.

NINA: I hate my life.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hmm, hmm.

That is what I'm talking about,
Shauna.

Billyumz,
aren't you seeing Carly?

No, I'm just seeing you.

And that ass.

Yeah. I, uh, hate to
break it to you, Billyumz,

but I would not join this
sorority to get closer to you.

Okay.

Look, I-I know that
I joke around with you a lot.

And I know I can be
kind of a dick,

but I do know what
you're going through.

I do.

And I just want you to know
that I can--

[Shauna sniffs]

I can make you
feel a lot better.

Like a lot--
Okay.

If you just give me a chance
to make you feel better, Shauna.

Ah, gross.

Ah, oh.
Hi.

Hi.

You look nervous.

Were you just hitting
on my boyfriend?

[Shauna laughs]

N-no.

Hmm?
No, I wasn't.

The lady doth protest
too much, me thinketh.

Macbeth played by
Magnetto from X-Men.

Tasty.

Uh, it's Magneto.

And I'm pretty sure
that's Hamlet. Methinks.

Okay, look, Billyumz
is just a side dick to me.

He'd hit on a dead body
if it had a halfway decent ass.

So tell me the truth.

Did he hit on you?

And remember
what happens to liars.

A-ah, right.
You lie, you die.

A little severe,
but I like it.

Hmm-wait.

Did one of the sisters
send me this text?

[text on cell phone]:
WELCOME TO KAPPA KAPPA PHI
NEW RULE AT KAPPA KAPPA PHI.
YOU LIE, YOU DIE.

Not me. But damn,
you should watch your back.

Get dressed.
Mama needs to get her drink on.

Let me guess.
He's already banging a pledge?

You need to go full Lorena
on that boy with a butter knife.

[knock on door]

<i> BILLYUMZ: Let's go.
</i>It's almost ten o'clock.

Oh, my God.
Hello, beautiful.

<i> BILLYUMZ: Ow! What the--</i>

Stop hitting on other girls.

Sorry, babe.

Did you finish up
the basement yet?

No, I didn't want to
get blood on my sneaks.

Those are some
pretty cool sneakers.

Yeah.

Stop. Just get her done
and--and then we can go.

No, no touching
until you're finished. Agh!

[footsteps pounding on stairs]

I don't know
what to do with him.

I do.

Ah.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Dammit.

[suspenseful music]

Ah, dammit.

Box is dripping?

Great.

[splashes paint]

[suspenseful music]

What?

[suspenseful music]

[splashes paint]

[mysterious music]

Hmm.

What the--

[Billyumz grunts]

You want us to do what?

I haven't been to that part
of the basement since the fire.

Mostly because, well, we've
heard some noises down there.

Ah.

[Billyumz screams]

Maybe it's a pack
of rabid raccoons.

Carly!

I doubt that very much.

[Billyumz screams]

But anyway, I can't say
for sure what's down there,

but I am sure
that you can handle it.

Ah, I can't.

You can.

And just for that, you should be
the one to bring the boxes

up to the attic
when you're done.

If you like creepy,

you'll love it up there.

Hmm.

CARLY: Why're you still
standing here? Seriously?

Hmm.

I believe in you. [chuckles]

[Billyumz groans]

[Billyumz screams]

SHAUNA: Come on, you guys.

They would never send us
somewhere unsafe.

That's not what sisters do.

[Shauna breathes nervously]

Uh-hmm.

Stop being a little bitch.

Urgh!

[running footsteps]

Guys, wait up.

Oh, great.

MAXINE: They're just--
they're just messing with us.

They turned off the breakers
or something.

SHAUNA: Yeah.

NINA: Hmm.

Ah! Oh, my!
MAXINE: Oh, no, no.

[Nina and Maxine screaming]

Okay, here.

[Carly laughs]
[Nina panting]

What in the holy crap
was that?

[laughs] No. Come on, Maxine.

It was a trust exercise.

And you both failed, miserably.

Do you think we'd actually
put you in any real danger?

It's fake blood, losers.

Billyumz did it.

Now, go back down there
and clean those walls.


[both chuckle]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MAXINE: Ah. [chuckles]
NINA: Yes.

Wow. This stuff
looks so real.

They went all out.

It-wait, wait,
what are you doing?

It's probably just like
corn syrup or something?

So you think to
put it-it in your mouth?

I don't--

What the hell's
wrong with you?

Tastes like pennies.

[mysterious music]

Hey guys,
come here for a sec.

MAXINE: What?

Ah-it--
I don't want to touch that.

That's gross.

What the fuck--

SHAUNA: Wait.
MAXINE: What?

What is it?

It's my sister's.

She gave me the matching locket
before she

went to college.

Oh.

I have like no relationship
with my family. I'm jealy.

There's nothing
to be jealous about.

My dad was cheating on my mom
for years.

He lied to us all about it.

Made her go mental
and she left.

Lies tore our family apart.

But in the end, my sister and I,
we had each other.

Laura really took care of me
through all of it.

[Shauna exhales]

MAXINE: Wait.

Why is her locket
down in the basement?

I thought the fire
happened upstairs?

NINA: I'm not gonna die.
These girls are crazy.

I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.

Whoo. Whoo. Whoo.

May I borrow
your fiery red heels?

Jodi still has them.

Ah, well, I'm sure
you have more in your closet.

Fine.

Hmm. Thanks, hon.

Billyumz, that's not funny.

I'm done with him this time.
For real, brah.

[Carly grunts]

Did you lock it?

Duh. Let's go.

[Derrick moaning]
[continuous thud]

Do you hear that?

Jodi and Mo's room.

Wait.

Great idea.

I'm sure whatever it is,
is on fire.

[Derrick moaning]

[bed springs squeaking]

Oh, hi. [chuckles]

Jodi,

what are you doing here?

We thought
you went to the party?

We couldn't stay at Sig Ep

'cause I'm sort of kind of
dating Jagger,

but he's dating Mara Stephens,
so it's all good.

You signed an oath never
to allow a boy in your bedroom.

Oh, what?

You want me to fuck him
in the hallway?

[Jodi chuckles]

You want more--
Shh!

She could do worse.

She has done worse.

[Nina screams]

What now?

Oh, my God!
Oi. Oh, my God!

Get out of my way. I'm getting
the hell out of here.

Nina, it was a prank.

NINA: No, it's not a prank.

It's Tulsi's headless body

in the attic.

CARLY: What are you
talking about?

[Nina gasps]

â™ª Good bye â™ª

[Shauna screams]
â™ª Good bye â™ª

â™ª Good luck â™ª

Shauna!

Holy fuck!

â™ª All my friends â™ª

â™ª At the end â™ª

â™ª All alone â™ª

â™ª I won't â™ª

â™ª See you again â™ª


What was that?

â™ª It's the â™ª

â™ª End of this time â™ª

<i>JODI: Go see what that was. Go.
DERRICK: Can I finish first?</i>

<i> I'm not done.
</i>JODI: Just, Derrick, get off.

Okay. Ah, all right.
Ow, God. Ah.

[Shauna gasps]

[Shauna breathes heavily]

â™ª So how well â™ª

â™ª Do we know â™ª

â™ª We have such a long way
To go â™ª

â™ª When you sleep â™ª

â™ª Tonight â™ª

Shauna! Oh my God!

Are you okay?

I-I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

You just took a swan dive
onto a hardwood floor.

Girl...

someone is looking out for you.

Hurry up.

No. I'm just waiting
for the cock-clock

to go from eleven to six.

[Jodi grunts]
And, you know,

if Mara asks if we've screwed,

just do what I always do, lie.

[Derrick gasps]

Derrick?

[Jodi laughs]

Derrick?

[Derrick grunts]

[Jodi chokes and coughs]

[Jodi screams]

Okay, I'm so out of here.

[breathing deep]
Carly, give me the key.

It's not locked.
Probably just stuck.

[all gasp]

[sighs] This--
this is not normal.

Okay...

calm down.

Everything's gonna be fine.

[Jodi breathes traumatized]

[shouts] Derrick is dead.

[Jodi breathes heavily]

Who the fuck is Derrick?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Here you go.

So what's it like
to kill someone?

I didn't kill him.

He fell off the bed and
he stabbed himself in the chest

with my high heel.

Though it wasn't my high heel,
it was Ashley's.

Uh-huh.

I'm sorry. I can't.

The back door.
We'll go out the back.

Nina.

Huh. Guys!

MAXINE: Nina.

[grunting] It's locked.
How are they locked?

You guys, I think it's time
we should call the cops.

You think?
Uh-huh.

I don't have service.
Anybody?

This has to be a prank.

Yeah. Tell that to Tulsi
in the attic,

if you can find her head.

What? I didn't kill her.

I know. Okay. Okay look.

There has to be a way out,
right?

So, let's find a window
that opens, okay?

Everyone pair up.

Hey.
Do you wanna be my partner?

Oh! Uh... I already
promised... Shauna.

[Jodi grunting]

Hey.

I-I already have--
have someone.

Come on, you guys,
let's go.

Ehh!


[Jodi screaming]

Yes.

<i> - [ghostly voice whispers]
</i>They lie, they lie. Iggy.

Wait. Do you hear that?


[all gasp]
No, no, no, no, no.

This-th-this isn't happening.

Did you hear that voice?
Yeah. Who lies?

Who the hell is Iggy?

Laura. No. No.

There's no way.
That's not possible.

Wait. What! Laura is Iggy?

No. I-I'm Iggy.

It's what my sister
used to call me.

She used to call me
Shauna Iguana,

which eventually became Iggy.

Okay. That's really
sweet and everything,

but I am freaking the F out
right now.

Jodi. No. No.
[thud]

Look, I know that this is
totally crazy,

but I-I think that my sister--

Your sister what?

I think that she might be
trying to communicate with me.

[scoffs] What?

Okay. You little weirdo.
We need to blow our way out.


Okay. So, we turn on
all the pilots,

then we shut the doors
and we fill the room with gas.

And then what, Rain Man?

And then, kaboom!

We blow the side
of the house off.

So you're with me?

One hundred percent.
And by "with you" I mean

that I'll be on the other side
of the house with the pledges

and everyone else,
hiding behind a sofa.

Their safety
is my top priority.


Yeah.

Okay. Jodi, this is
a really terrible idea.

Okay. Look,
there's something going on

that we don't
entirely understand.

Okay, scrub.

Talk to me when you get
some rando's blood in your hair.

Does nothing work in this house?

The house doesn't
want you to leave.

It's a house, Shauna.
Houses don't want anything.

It's a house. Oh, matches.

Okay. So, maybe there's
something inside the house.

Maybe there's something that--

A ghost?
You a Ghostbuster now?

No. That's not what I said.

Look, none of this makes sense.

How did I survive that fall?

How does the window
whisper works?

[shouting] Hello! Huh!

The text.
What text?

The text that only I got.

"You lie, you die."

Okay, maybe you should be
rushing the, uh, nuthouse

down the street.

Wait...

Derrick.
What?

Did Derrick lie?

Do you know if Derrick
lied to you about anything?

Well, he was cheating
on his girlfriend with me

when he died.
Does that count?

Oh! An escape hatch.

What? No, Jodi.

That's not an escape hatch.
It's a crawlspace.

Yeah. Well, you guys
can stay back and die,

but I'm escaping
out of that hatch.

Okay, Jodi.

I need you to tell me
what happened to Laura.

Jodi, believe me, I know you
think that none of this matters,

but I need to know
what happened to my sister.

You need to tell me the truth.

You know what happened.


<i> - [voice whispers]
</i>You lie, you die.

Wait. Did you hear that?
[groans] Ugh-ugh.

Jodi, I think I know
how to stop this.

But you need to
tell me the truth.

You need to tell me
the truth right now

before something happens to you.

But the truth is
she died in a fire.

She died in a fire.

Ouch!

Oh, my God, Jodi.


You're fine, you told the truth,
so you're-you're okay.

[scoffs] I'm fine.

[Shauna sighs]

[Shauna screams]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Shauna sobbing]

Safe to say her plan
didn't work out how she wanted.

[sobs] The last thing she said
is that my sister, Laura,

died in the fire,
and then this happened.

I'm gonna go find
a cell signal.

I suggest you all do the same.

[Shauna sobbing]

Anything?
No.

[cellphone beeps]

Oh, my god.
Call the police.

I-I-I still don't have
any service, or bars.

But look.

Wait. Do they mean
your left or my left?

[door hinges creaking]

Alright.

[girl screaming on laptop]

[girl crying on laptop]

ASHLEY: [on laptop]: You guys
make her clap like a seal.

Are you a seal?

Or a walrus with those teeth?

GIRL [on laptop]:
I am like a cat.

ASHLEY [on laptop]:
You're a cat!

Somebody needs to cool off!

These people are [indistinct].

JODI: Oh my gosh,
they're so dumb.

[girls laughing]

ASHLEY [on laptop]:
Okay, say the pledge.

Laura.
ASHLEY: You have one family,

and one family only.
Kappa Kappa Phi.

That's it. Give it to me.
Come on.

I have one family,
and one family only.

Kappa Kappa Phi.

Okay. I don't think
Laura's saying it.

That's the spirit.
It's so good.

[girl screaming]

[girls screaming]

JODI: Alright, now.
Get the fuck out.

Get up. Go. Go.

Do you have
a problem, scrub?

[Laura sobbing]

No. It just--
It just seems a little silly.

What did you say?

I have a family.
I have a sister.

Did I ask you
about your actual sister?

No.

Say the pledge.

[shivering] My family
lied to me my whole life.

I'm not gonna do it.

Isn't that the basic tenet

of Kappa Kappa Phi?

Honesty?

Yup. Super important.
Say the pledge.

No.

Oh, it's so cute.
Did your family get it for you?

Last chance.

No.

Ice her down.

Don't let her up
until she's changed her mind.

Okay.

JODI: Sister, come on.
What is happening?

This could've
all been avoided.

You should have
just said the pledge.

CARLY: [indistinct].
[girls laughing]

Oops.

Just leave her there
until she changes her mind.

Okay.
I think she gets it.

What did you say?
[Shauna gasps]

TULSI: Did you just push me?

ASHLEY: Uh, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

Do you want to go
pray on it, Tulsi?

CARLY: Guys, I'm scared.

JODI: Can we just turn
the lights on--

CARLY: You guys, I'm scared.
JODI: This is ridiculous.

ASHLEY: Very funny, Laura.

CARLY: Laura? Laura!

[Ashley clapping]

And the Oscar goes to Laura.

Congratulations.
No one's buying it.

No, no, no. I-I think
she's been electrocuted!

Oh, my God.
We have to get her out.

What! No!
You'll get lit up too.

Oh my God. Unplug it.
Unplug it. Come on.

CARLY: Oh, my God. Oh, my god!
You guys, I think she's dead!

JODI: Help!
Somebody, call a doctor.

ASHLEY: Nobody
is calling a doctor.

This was an accident,
because if it wasn't,

we would all be going to jail.

Laura died in a fire.

TULSI: What fire?

ASHLEY: The one
we're about to set, Tulsi.

Why are you still filming this,
Karen? Shut it.

NINA: Come on.

I can get out,
through the chimney.

MAXINE: What?
Yeah. If you wanna die.

[chuckling] Not a chance.

I took rock climbing
for my PE credit.

Oh, so that makes you
an expert.

Basically.

Carly.

[Carly grunting]

CARLY: Eww!

Eww, was that a bird?

[gasps] The chimney's alive!

How did you get into college?

Carly's trying to climb out.

CARLY: I'm already halfway up.

MAXINE: Carly, keep climbing.

Oh, crap!

What the heck?
Turn that off.

[Maxine shrieks]

Shit!

Carly, I can't turn it off.

Just keep climbing. Climb.

Hey! What's going on?
What's happening?

Carly's trying to
climb out the chimney.

What?
CARLY: I'm gonna make it.

MAXINE: Carly, keep going.

Do not look down.
Keep on climbing.

CARLY: I'm almost there.
A couple more feet.

[Carly screams]
Carly, you can do it.

Come on, Carly.

I'm gonna make it.

I'm gonna make--

MAXINE: Carly?

Carly, did you make it?

I think she made it,
I think she made it.

[all screaming]

[all panting]

What the hell happened?

She lied, Ashley.
And she died.

[Ashley screaming]

<i> SHAUNA: They all lied.</i>

They killed my sister,

and then they covered up
her murder with a fire.

Yeah right, psycho.

You know, that's a lie.

NINA: Okay. Enough. Stop.

Whatever you are, just stop.

SHAUNA: It's okay.
It's okay. We're fine.

MAXINE: I'm dead.

SHAUNA: Shit, me too.

MAXINE: I have a lighter.

[lighter flickers]

NINA: What's on your face?

MAXINE: What do you mean?

NINA: You have Kappa Kappa Phi
written on it.

MAXINE: You too.

Did you do this?

ASHLEY: Yeah.
When the lights went out,

I scooped up some of
Carly's burnt remains,

smeared Kappa Kappa Phi
on all of your foreheads,

in the dark, in 15 seconds
without any of you noticing,

'cause I'm magic.

What? What the hell
are you all looking at?

Why are you all looking at me?

I strongly suggest
that you tell the truth, Ashley.

No.
No, you get away from me.

[Ashley screaming]

[running footsteps]

What is happening?

Ashley, it's time for you
to tell the truth.

I've seen the video,
and it was you

who told the other girls
to lie,

and look what happened to them.

I didn't lie.

Your sister died in a fire.

[eerie whisper]
You lie!

[gasps]
What is happening?

Wrong answer.

I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

I didn't do anything.
I didn't lie.

What is happening?

[Ashley sobbing and panting]

[in Laura's voice]:
You've all been marked,

and you are now my sisters.

Ashley, what the hell?

[in Laura's voice]:
No more hazing,

no more hurting each other,

no more cheating,
and no more lies.

Not in this house.

You are all Kappa Kappa Phi.


And we are loyal to each other.

Laura.

Hey, Iggy.

I knew it was you.
I knew it.

[water splashing softly]

You remember that summer
when Mom left us all alone?

I hugged you, and you remember
what I said to you.

I said it doesn't matter
who leaves...

It matters who stays.
It matters who stays.

But you did this.

You killed all of those girls.
Why?

To protect you.

To protect all of you.

Those girls were monsters, Iggy.

Laura, your death
was an accident.

You call the fire an accident?

[electricity sparking]

They set the house on fire
to hide the truth.

Sisters don't lie to each other,

and sisters
don't hurt each other.

You're right, they shouldn't.

It was out of fear,
and what they did was wrong.

But it wasn't murder.

How can you defend them,

after you watched
what they did to me,

how they hurt me...

and left me all alone,
and took you from me...

and tore us apart?

What about our pledge, Iggy?

What about you and me?

When I lost you,

I didn't think I could
ever be whole again.

[Shauna sobbing]

And now you're back,
still protecting me,

even when you're gone.

I'll always protect you,
kiddo.

I love you so much.

But I don't need you
to take care of me anymore.

I'm strong because
you were my sister.

Whatever you're going to do,
stop, please. Okay?

No more killing,
not for me.

You have to promise me.

Okay. I promise.

No more killing...

[water splashing softly]

...after this one.

Laura, no!

[electricity sparking]

Shit!

[electricity crackling]

[water bubbling]
[Shauna sobbing]

I'm getting out of here.

[eerie whisper]
You lie, you die!

<i> You lie, you die!</i>

<i> - [on TV]: After a month
</i>of the entire Greek Row

being shut down,
it's been decided

that Kappa Kappa Phi
sorority house

will remain closed
pending an investigation

into the deaths
of several of its members.

That said, ahem, parties
broke out everywhere

when it was announced that the
rest of Greek Row can reopen.

[cheering and shouting]

Okay. Obviously,
cut the last part.

And get the hell out of here.
Fucking frat boys.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I mean, I think
it's the right thing.

VOICE: [eerie whisper]
You lie...

You know, no one should ever
go into that house again.

Uh-huh.

I love her, but my hope is
that they tear that house down.

Sorry, am I still talking?
You must--

you must think
I'm a crazy person.

I absolutely do not.

Stewart! Did you hear
anything I just said?

Are you just pretending
to listen to me

so you can hook up with me?

No.

VOICE: [eerie whisper]
You lie...

You're not lying, are you?

Noooo!

Sex is the last thing
on my mind.

Okay.

[creaking]
[thud]

[Shauna screaming]

[song playing]
