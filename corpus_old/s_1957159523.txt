[ Man #1 ] Y'all still soaking those labels? [ Woman ] Gonna soak you next.

Come on, Dexter. Don't do it, Blusette.

[ Laughing ]

[ Man #2 ] "Quintessential New York Club Kids Blusette Ford...

"and foster brothers Dexter Banks and Freddy Roland,

"soak labels off L.P.'s so other deejays
can't bite their beats.

[ Laughing ] "Dexter was to produce the legendary Blusette demo tape...

"that led to her discovery by Rhythm Records' mogul
Curtis 8-Ball Harris.

A family tiff ensued."

Jesse Collins here.
Got my man Venom
on the ones and twos.

If you are just tuning in,
we are about to bless you...

with the freestyle sounds
of one of Rhythm Records'
tightest artists.

My man, Esaron,
the Pretty Villain.

[ Esaron ] â™ª One, two Yo, I heard you happy for me â™ª

[ Laughing ]
Jesse!

Butter, baby.
Uh-huh.

Blusette Ford!
Okay?

â™ª Who's that pretty man  talking like he got
the whole world in his hand â™ª

What you got for me today,
Freddy?

I got you nothing
but the good stuff.Come on with it.

All right.

Look out!

8-Ball told me to tell you,
you got the first.

Shoot.
[ Chuckling ]

Long as I've been breaking off
records for 8-Ball,
I know I gots the first.

[ Chuckles ]
You know this sounds
just like a--

Like a hit!

You know it is, my man.
You know it is.

You know you're
my first ad, right?

My first P-1 station.

I'm always glad
to help a young brother
bust that cherry.

[ Laughing ]
Yeah!

When the man
trusts you enough...

to deal
with the likes of me,

you're coming up
in the world!

Hey, hey!

[ Laughing ]

Don't rock his boat.

You just ride that bad boy.

Yeah, all right.
All right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You know...

you got a job
to die for.

â™ªâ™ª [ Car Radio ]Hook me up with the
macaroni and cheese joint,

and a piece of peach cobbler
with Haagen-Dazs on it.

Hey, I'm not evil!

â™ªâ™ª [ Radio Continues ]You like this cut?
Hot!

[ Woman ] Ah, that's nice.My new choice.

You can't play everywhere.
You better get it, girl!

[ Radio, Chattering Continue ]

Ever ridden in
a car like this? Huh?

Get out of the car.

Get out of the car!

Get the fuck
out of the car!

[ Screaming ]

Police! Drop it!

Drop it!

[ Groans ]

You do not move!

You are under arrest.

You have the right
to remain silent.

If you give up that right,
you are a dumb motherfucker. [ Radio Blaring ]

Now turn
that shit down.

Now?Turn it down.

Come on, girl.

Sorry I missed
the big party.

Girl, don't you even
worry about that.

I gotta tell you
thank you for that book.
I read that every day!

You miss me,
baby brother?

Do I miss you?
Please!

8-Ball got the whole world
playing your records
20 times a day.

Don't nobody miss you.

But looky here.
Boo, ya!

Huh?God, I look fat.

Get outta here with that.
You know
you're lookin' butter!

So? Talk to me.
How long you been back?

A couple hours.

Thank you
for making me do it.

I feel like I got my soul
out of a pawn shop. I never
could've done it without you.

You work them 12 steps,
one day at a time.

I got 407 days straight up.
I'm chewing the hell
out of some gum!

But the rest is
cause and effect.

That is just it.
I want to cause the effect.

I want to start making music,
not just records.
I want a new life, brand-new.

New music, new label,
new management.Wait a minute.

New label, new management?
Does 8-Ball know
you talking like this?

I know the two of you have got
this father-son thing going on.
But you are so naive.

Blu, we are set up
like fat cats. Okay?

Hello!

8-Ball has been working on
some secret-ass deal.

I don't know what it is,
but it's got to be epic
'cause nobody talkin' about it.

I know exactly what it is
and who it's with, and I am
not going to be a part of it.

Why are you being
such a bitch?

He is playing you like a little bitch.

Oh, you think 8-Ball is
the Man'cause he gives you
a few little trinkets...

and a corporate card?

He ain't nothing but
a common hoodlum and thief.
Fuck him!

He does not care about you!

I made him hire your ass, so you'd have a job when you got out of rehab.

He will fire you
the day I walk.
Fuck him!

I see you've come back to us
a well-balanced woman.

You got a chip--
A chip on each shoulder.

You are slipping,
little brother.

You better read that book again.
"As the man thinketh,
so he lives."

This is the only chip I need.

What is wrong with you?
8-Ball got enough juice to
make you bigger than anybody!

He can take you to the top!

You should know that lookin'
down from the top
ain't always that much fun.

How many times did
I have to get your cryin',
hyper-ventilatin'...

vertigo ass when we was kids?

I do not want to be on top.
I want us to be the best!

Don't worry. Where I go, you go.

But you stay out of my way.

[ Cheering, Screaming ]

[ Cheering, Screaming ]

All right, picture this.
It's 19--

Fifty-nine.
Fifty-nine.

A small-time composer
writes a smash hit...

for the biggest black star
of the day.

Makes a few bucks, literally.

But he takes his earnings
and he bets it on himself.

He finds a skinny kid
with a singing group.

Cuts a new tune for a big label.

But they don't hear it.
They can't hear it!

But he does, and he believes
in that skinny kid.

So he borrows $800 from his family.

Takes that same record...

and promotes it
straight to the street level.

That $800 was well-spent.

That composer...

became the richest black man
in America.

And that pop star of the day? Was buried without a headstone.

Go figure.
Only in this business.

I always wanted
to meet you.

[ Laughing ]
There you go!

How you doing?

Looking sharp.

Nice to see you.

Russell Simmons.

I'm surprised
you ain't got your phone on.

Meet my brother Freddy.

"Thank you for coming.
God bless. Good night."

You the man! I'm just tryin'
to fit in your world.Keep going through here.

Dick!

Freddy, right?Yes, it is.
How are you, Mr. Scott?

Having a
good time?Yeah, it's cool.

Come on, honey.

Miss Ford, it's so nice
to meet you!
Would you like a drink?

No.

Mr. Roland,
very nice ensemble.

Kenneth Cole?
Very stylish.

Thank you very much...
Lucy.

No, actually it's Carmen.
I'm filling in
for my girlfriend tonight.

You don't remember me?

I met you at H. Lorenzo
on Sunset where I work.
I sold you that suit.

I gave you a discount
because we live
in the same building.

Remember?
You laughed because
my name is Carmen Jones.

I'm sorry, I don't.
But it's real nice
to meet you right now.

Um, well, anyway
it's nice meeting you.

Nice to meet you.

I gotta get back to work.
Purple lace curtains.

Wait a minute, baby.

You're too cute
to get away.

Freddy Roland.

Oh!

So I... get the special
"booty" call card.

Special cards
for special people, right?

Mr. Roland, I must inform you.
I am a devout player hater.

Is that right?

[ 8-Ball ]
To the skinny kid
I believe in.

May he always drink
champagne... for iced tea.

All right.
Whoa!

Every head must bow.

Every knee must bend.
Rick Darren,

meet the greatest singer in the world:

Blusette.

Pleasure.

No, the pleasure's
all mine.

Mr. Harris tells me
you went to the islands
for a vacation. Which one?

St. Barts.
My home in St. Barts. Sounds beautiful.

How was it?

Sobering.

Rick, if you'll excuse
Blusette and me, we have
some unfinished business.

Look forward to seeing
you again, Miss Ford. Mm-hmm.

I'm going to see Blusette.I don't care.
Got a job for you, kid.

What?Ball wants you to look
after his new friend.

Be good.

[ Chuckling ] Look at you.

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Look. I know
you been through a lot.

Relax.
Relax.

Baby, we are so close.

The first two
sold 11 million.

The third album
gonna outdo both of 'em.

So just hang in there!

Whenever you feel the need...

to get nice,
I got you covered.

Fuck you.

My man!

You must be Mr. Rick Darren.
Am I right?

Yeah!
You must be Freddy Roland,
the heir to the throne.

Let's see.
You redesigned their computer
systems, security systems,

and Mr. Harris is grooming you
for your own label someday.

I see my man here knows
his stuff.

I also know that you and I
are going to be good friends.

You're one of the things
I like best about this company.

I'm never wrong
about these things.

Um, what exactly
is your connection
to Rhythm Records, may I ask?

[ Chuckles ]
Do you hit, Freddy?Pardon me, Mr. Darren?

Call me Rick.
Do you hit balls?
Do you play tennis?

Tennis? No, man.
I'm from the Bronx.

I never learned
how to play no game
where "love" meant nothin'.

We should get together.

There's a lot of things
you could learn to like
where "love" means nothing.

[ Woman Chuckles ] I love this music.

Case in point.

Ladies! Ladies!
How you doing?

I know a lot more
than you think I do.

I know you've been stealing
from me and everybody else.

I know that I want out.

Ah.

Come here.

All right.

All right.
Just give me two days.

Forty-eight hours, okay?
We sit, we talk, we renegotiate.

Just sign the contract.

All right?
We look at the books.

Anything you think I owe you,
I'll pay it.

Cash money. All right?

Do that for me.
Please.

And I will make you one of the richest women in show business.

Just sign the contract.

You had it all.

My money, my body.

I would have
done anything for you.

The motherfucker
who strung my ass out,

turned me out into
this music business stroll.

Pimpin' ain't easy, but
let me tell you something,
'ho'in' is harder.

What's wrong with you?

I used to think
you were this great man.

But in reality,
you ain't nothing but
a fuckin' liar and traitor.

Reality?

Reality's a funny thing.

Because it wears big boots
so you always hear it coming.

One day, your face is up
on a big billboard.

The next, on a milk carton.

I brought you into this world,
and I'll take you out of it!

I did not
have to come here.

I came to you face-to-face
out of respect, and
you fuckin' threaten me.

You are fired.
Explain that to your partners.

I'm fired.
I'm-- I'm--

I'm fired?
Come on now!

Go ahead, hit me.
Hit me, Daddy.

Blusette, come on, baby.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

Hey, come on!

Where are the recording artists
around here? [ Beeper Beeping ]

Hmm, Khaleed.

Freddy.

What? Hey. Excuse me.
Blusette, what?

Will you stop?
What's wrong with you?

God granted me serenity.

You need to chill, 'cause
I gotta take care of business.
Khaleed put himself in jail.

Go take care of him.
Come back after you bail
him out of jail.

We're gonna make plans.[ 8-Ball ]
Ladies and gentlemen,

I give you Blusette,
the greatest singer
in the world.

[ Cheering, Applause ]

[ Freddy ] I'm gonna be responsible for the kid Khaleed.

Dex, remember
all the crazy shit
we used to do?

You know we were crazier than this kid will ever be. We didn't turn out so bad.

Look, you know me,
Freddy.

You know I don't
believe in law.
I believe in justice.

Now, that little kid
happens to be the luckiest
motherfucker on this planet,

because I was tailin'
the guy that he shot.

What are you going
to charge him with?

Whatcha gonna
charge him with?
Nothing.

There you go!
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you.

Checked out the gun.
It turns out there's
no bodies on it... yet.

Turns out the kid got
a license for the gun,
but no license for a car.

Go figure.

Now, as an African-American
officer,

it is too damned...
embarrassin'...

to go and report
some stupid nigger shit
like that.

He's got parents, man.

I fixed his gun
so the next time
he tries to shoot somebody,

he's gonna get
a big surprise.

I know you ain't a gun man,
so I'm giving this to you.

Take it!

Just make sure that boy
don't pop up dead.
All right?

What do I gotta do now?

Drive his punk ass home.
Ah, 'cause there's no charge!

You, don't say
a damn thing!

I didn't do nothin',
though, man!

What is wrong
with you, huh?

Shut up. Shut up!
Shut up.

Hey, Dex.

Thanks, man.

You know something?
You should come back
and work with us, baby.

Blusette.
That's right.

She left me for the bigger
and better deal. Remember?
Now I'm a solid-ass citizen.

Anyway, I like arresting
criminals, not...
working for 'em.

Dex, you'd be workin'
for Blusette, baby!

I drew that line
in the sand a long time ago.

She's clean.
She's ready to make amends.

Me and Blusette
back in the music game.

Come on, Dex.
I owe you for getting me sober.

No, no, no.
You don't owe me
a damn thing.

Just win, baby.
Just win. All right?

Yeah.

I want to thank you--You shut up.
We're going. Let's go.

Hey, y'all--No, let's go.

[ Khaleef Continues
Shouting, Indistinct ]

Thank you for
not callin' 8-Ball.

He would have fined me, like,
62 Gs for my morals clause,
or somethin'.

Whatever.
Yeah, whatever.I appreciate it.

You know what?
Thank you for the car.
'Cause I'm keepin' this thing...

until your dumb ass
gets a license.

That's a joke, right?[ Chuckles, Faintly ]

[ Gospel Singers ] â™ª Far too late

â™ª I know it's time

â™ª I know

â™ª I've come too far  from where I started from â™ª

â™ª Nobody told me

[ Gasping ]

â™ª Nobody told me  Oh â™ª

â™ª That this road  would be safe â™ªâ™ª

Hey, Blue.

Hey, baby,
are you decent?

Blue!
Hey, girl.

Jesus!

Blue? Blue?
Come on. Oh, gee!

Come on, baby, wake up.
Blue!

Blue, wake--
Come on.
[ Grunts ]

Oh, shit!
What did you do, Blue?
What did you do?

Come on, baby,
please wake up for me.

Shit! No!

Come on.

Come on, baby.

[ Phone Dialing ]Come on!

Telephone, Mr. Harris.Yeah.

It's Freddy.
Blusette is dead!

Who knows?

Nobody.
I just got here, man!

Keep it that way.
Stay put.

And, Freddy,
don't talk to anybody.
This is a family matter.

Hey boy, help me!

I'm on my way.

Come on.

Oh, God.
[ Sobs ]

Oh, baby.

[ Sobbing ] No!

No!

God, no!
[ Moaning ]

8-Ball?

8-Ball!

My condolences, son.

She's gone.
What are we gonna do?

Y'all were like blood.

Who'd you tell?

Who'd you tell, son?I didn't tell nobody.

Call the police?
911?

No! You told me not to,
so I didn't.Good work.

We gotta call somebody now!

Come on, man!
She was a smoker, not a shooter.
You know that.

She'd no sooner hit herself
with a needle than jump out
the fuckin' window!

You know that!Think so?

I know so!

It's a delicate situation
we have here, Freddy.

Complicated things
that affect the lives
of a whole lot of people.

Blusette was a hero,
a role model!

But more importantly,
she was someone everyone
in this room loved.

We can't let her go out
like this, Freddy.

We can't spoil the meaning
of her life over this!

No. I don't want
to let anything
get blown out of proportion.

What are you talking
about, proportion?
Blusette is dead!

We gotta call the cops, man.

I'm calling my brother.

I'm calling him.
What?

You've had a lot of trauma.
Okay?

Look.

I want you to let Benzo
take you home.

I'll take care
of Blusette.

We'll talk in the morning.
Come on. It's okay.

Okay.

Okay.
You're right.

Let me go upstairs.
I got some stuff in the room.

I'm gonna come right back.

I'll just get my stuff.Okay.

Oh.

Blusette.

Freddy!

Come here.

I see you found the dog.

Where you gonna go?

House!

Come on, Freddy!

Damn it!
[ Panting, Groaning ]

[ Laughing ] What's up, dude? We don't have to do this the hard way.

[ Phone Dialing ]

Bait time.
Bait time.

[ Beeper Beeping ]

[ Motor Revving,  Tires Screeching ]

Showtime.

Dexter, I swear to you,
she was dead.

She was lying right here
with me, man.
She was dead!

8-Ball killed her.

He tried to kill me.

I found this, all right?
So take that.What's that?

It's his Jukebox Danny lighter.
Only one other person's got one.
He's been dead 20 years.

You take that as evidence.Evidence of what, Freddy?

There's no stiff.

There's no blood.
There's no sign of a struggle.

This is not
some crime scene.

This is the house
of a very rich sister with
a very real drug problem.

She's full of shit,
Freddy.

Probably off hitting
the pipe somewhere
right now.

I'm telling you, man, she was here!

Dexter, she was 33 days sober.
You believed that.

Yeah, well, people binge
and fall off every day. Jesus Christ.

They killed her dog, okay?
They threw it
in the goddamn trash.

I'm sorry, brother, but you
call Ace Ventura for that shit.

Fuck you!

Come on, guys, we got
some real crimes to solve.

[ Officer ] Another wild-goose chase?

[ Tires Squealing ]

[ Woman ] Do you know
where we're going?

We areso lost.
I'll fill it up
and relax and think.

[ Phone Dialing ]

[ Answering Machine ]
This is Freddy.
Do it at the beep.

[ Answering Machine ]
I just called
to jog your memory.

This is Carmen Jones.
Remember?

Purple curtains?
The apartment across
the way?

[ Chuckles ]
Talk to you soon,
Freddy.

[ Machine Beeps ]You fucker.

[ Knock At Door ]Who is it?

Hey, girl,
it's Freddy Roland.
You in there?

Yeah. Um...
just one second, okay?

I said, soon,
but damn, baby!

Hey, baby.
What's happening?

Hey!
What happened to you?

I locked myself out of my crib.
I need to come in your joint.
Is that cool?

I don't know, Freddy.
I don't know
if this is a good idea.

Come on, baby.
It's Freddy Roland here.
You can trust me.

Please?

All right.

Come in.

Thank you.

Ooh! You're
a little bit funky.

Yeah, I ran
into some trouble.

What kind of trouble,
Freddy?

Carmen, it's a long story.
All right?
It ain't worth telling.

Look at you!
You've ruined your suit!

Can I chill just a minute?
Cool?

Fine. You need a shower.
The bathroom's right there.

Here are some sweats...

and a towel.

Just in case there's any confusion, you're sitting on your bed.

Carmen, thanks.
All right?Mm-hmm.

Don't trip.
You won't even know I'm here.
All right? Relax.

Mm.

[ Shower Water Running ]

Hey, Freddy!

Freddy, you
expecting anybody?

Freddy?

One second, please.

Hi. Excuse me...
Miss Jones?

Yeah.
Benzo, right?Yeah, Benzo.

Benzo Al.How you doing?

I'm sorry to bother you
so late, but I'm looking
for my man Freddy.

Oh!

Do you mind
if I come in?

Sure, come in.
One second.

Please, come in.

Okay, thank you.

Wow!

My man Freddy told me
to meet him here
at your place.

Oh, so you must have his keys.Keys? Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

[ Carmen ] Freddy's in the shower, but make yourself at home.

Can I get you coffee?That would be great.
Thanks.

This is a nice, nice place
you got here.Thank you very much.

You live alone?

Sometimes.
Please, take off
your hat and coat.

[ Benzo ]
I won't be here
that long.

[ Carmen ]
Well, suit yourself.

Coffee coming up.
Thanks.

That's quite a distinctive look you've created for yourself, Mr. Benzo.

I try to make
an impression.
I believe in formality.

My taste is not as eclectic
as yours, though.

I really dig your crib.

[ Carmen ] Thank you very much.

[ Carmen ] So, what exactly do you do at Rhythm?

Manage things.

I fix them
so they work.

You and Freddy
been working together long?
Too long.

[ Benzo ]
But it's all good.

So you're quite
an artist, huh?

[ Carmen ]
I try to be.So am I.

[ Tea Kettle Whistling ]

[ Benzo ] Yep, really nice.

Mr. Benzo, would you like
cream and sugar
with your coffee?

Not a thing.

Just stand still.

[ Gunshot With Silencer ]

[ Carmen Screams ]

[ Benzo Screams ]

Benzo, come on, man.
Don't fuckin' shoot me!

[ Benzo Screams ]

Fuck.
[ Gasping ]

[ Carmen ] Freddy, don't kill him!

Freddy, don't shoot him!

Where the hell did you get
a Taser from?

A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.
What is going on?

I don't know!
Gimme this. Gimme this!
Jesus Christ.

[ Thumping ]
[ Groans ]

I thought these guys were your friends. What is going on?

They killed Blusette.
Okay?

We not gonna be safe here,
so pack some clothes.
We gotta go.

Oh, God!

What's with the antiques?

I was a prizefighter
back in my youth.

Italians used to hire
guys like me to collect
a fee for the jukes.

If the owner couldn't pay,
it was our job...

to take back the music,
which is usually in the box.

[ Chuckles ]
That's how I got
with Jukebox Danny.

Don't seem like much now,
but it was quite a business
back in the day.

Smoked my first Cuban
with Danny.

Made me a custom
jukebox cigar lighter.

Oh, sounds like
he had class.Yeah.

Made one for him too.

Only two in the world.
Lot of history
in those two lighters.

What was ol' Danny like?

I loved Danny.
He was what you'd call my...

rabbi in the business.

We started Rhythm together.

Legend has it that
you took advantage of Danny...

when he was having
legal problems.

They say you wrote
a dollar figure on a napkin.

I didn't take advantage.
I seized an opportunity.

Like I said,
I loved Danny.

People think they
call me 8-Ball because
I'm black and I'm bald.

But the truth be told,
Danny named me 8-Ball...

because I'm the last
to fall.

I stays on the table
till the game is done.

And I'm done talking
about this.

Isn't it true that the mob
set Danny up?

Take a fall for
the whole industry, like
he was some sort of godfather?

Please!
Danny wasn't no godfather!

He was an independent
record promoter.
He got caught and got played.

And I... got made.

[ Chuckling ]How much?

That's none
of your business.

Danny a godfather!

Had a one-nighter
with a little coke ho
on tour.

After he died, she
comes for half my company...

just 'cause she had a kid
by my ex-partner.

What did you do?

You can't let people
mistake your kindness
for weakness.

Otherwise you'll
never get rid of 'em.

I don't want to talk
about her or Danny.

I can't remember her name.

Her name was Eva.

She O.D.'d in 1987.

I'm a businessman.

And business is like love.
It means never having
to say you're sorry.

This used to be
a tough business, Ricky.So I've heard.

Danny couldn't make it.

But thanks to you...
I'm almost there.

Oh, you are there.

[ Car Radio ] â™ª I'm butter every day  All day, what you say â™ª

[ Freddy ]
Come on, come on.

â™ªâ™ª [ Car Radio ]

[ Car Alarm Blaring ]

Freddy!

Get in the car.
The car's
around the corner.

[ Carmen Screams ]
Freddy!

[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]

[ Carmen Screams ]

[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]

[ Gunshots ]

[ Man ]
Hurry up!
Quickly! Hurry up!

[ Car Alarms Blaring,  People Shouting ]

Get out of my way!

Um... Freddy,
I'm outta here.

You ain't going nowhere, girl.
I need you to help me
get up in here.

This is truly
your problem.

All right, forget you.
Don't help me.
Give me 10 minutes.

Wait here 10 minutes.
If I'm not back,
call the number on that card.

Ten minutes, Carmen.

What are you doing?I'm going with you.

All right, come on.[ Buzzer Buzzes ]

Go to the left.

Burning the midnight oil,
huh, Benzo?Mm-hmm.

Whoa, whoa.
Come on, brother.

You know your lady friend
gotta sign in too.
You know that.

And there's only
one elevator working,
so please be patient.

Damn! Y'all was partying
like it was the law.

I ain't never seen 8-Ball
that happy.

Gave all the brothers
a bottle of Moet & Chandon.
I ain't lying.

[ Elevator Bell Rings ]

Come on, come on.Hurry up!

What are you doing?Look above my head.
There's a surveillance camera.

Put your head down. Put your head down!

Keep it down
until we get off this thing.

He's taping us
right now.

Which way?To the right.

Go.

What kind of insurance
are we looking for?

What it always is.
Other people's money.Now we're thieves!

No, baby,
we're the good guys.
Watch yourself.

[ Carmen ] That was inconspicuous. What the hell are you doing?

Don't worry about it.
Ain't nobody checkin' for that.
Come on.

Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!What?

This is not your
Beverly Hills Y.W.C.A.
self-defense class.

These fools
are not playing.

You got a "nine" in that bag,
and I want it right now
for protection.

You know what you're doing?Do I look like
I know what I'm doing?

[ Snorts ]
Oh, shit.

Be careful.

I saved you before,
didn't I?

Can you just stand there
and act like you know
what you're doing?

You see something moving,
it's them or us.
You big enough for that?

Don't worry about that.
By the way,
it was the Crenshaw "Y."

Carmen, be careful.

[ Computing Starting Up ]

See those monitors
right there, Carmen?

[ Freddy ]
I need you to keep checking
that shit, okay?

All right, 8-Ball.

We're gonna take your
precious little money
and put it someplace else.

What money?

8-Ball's got a system of secret
Caribbean accounts he handles
from his laptop computer.

His laptop and
a grip of money are
right there in that safe.

I don't know how much
he's got, but I know
it's what I'm looking for.

â™ª Hey, it's in my heart [ 8-Ball ]
Don't hurt nobody.

â™ª Tell me about it

[ 8-Ball ] How you livin', Rick?

[ Rick ]
This is the life.

So, what are you goin' to do
with all that money?

A wise man once told me...

the difference between
bein' affluent and bein' rich...[ Woman Shrieks, Happily ]

is one works for his money;

the other makes his money
work for him.

Just a little bit concerned
about Blusette's attitude.

Big stars have big egos.

But they gonna make big money,
so sometimes you have
to bite your big lip.

There are no problems. Blusette signed the contract tonight.

Oh, yeah?

That's good,
'cause I can't afford
to blow it.

I've been working on this deal
for 30 years.

And I won't let you blow it.

[ 8-Ball Laughing ]

Here. Have some more...
iced tea.

Ladies, come on over
and keep my partner's feet warm.

Uh, password, okay?
Password. Password.

[ Computer Beeps,
"Bomb" Explodes ]Come on.

Let's try,
"M-o-n-e-y."

[ Woman, Indistinct ]Somebody's in the hallway.
Let's hurry up!

Only a couple minutes.
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
[ Woman Laughing ]

Hello?

Somebody here?

[ Gasps ][ Woman, Indistinct ]

[ Woman Chuckles,
Wickedly ]

You...
are one tall-ass chick.

[ Laughing ] [ Elevator Doors Open ]

[ Laughing ] Are you really going
to buy this company?

[ Rick ] Oh, yeah. Yeah.

All right,
just keep watchin'.

[ Rick ] You two girls sing?

[ Woman ] You're turning me off!Will you hurry up?

Oh, my God.
That's too funny!You know why?

Why?'Cause I'm gonna give you
a contract anyway.

[ Black Woman Shrieks ] No, you're not!
[ Laughs ]

Two more chances.

[ Women Singing,
Mockingly ]
[ Explosion, Beeping ]

[ Elevator Dinging ]

Come on. We gotta get out.
Come on. Let's go.
Butter.

[ Computer ]
Access granted.
Access granted.

[ Alarm Beeps,

That's it! I got your ass! [ Guard Chattering  To Himself ]

There it is.

[ Narrating Imaginary

Come on, Freddy, let's go.I'm goin',
I'm goin'.

[ Chattering Continues ]

What's that?What the hell is this?
I don't know! Come on!

[ Growling ]

Shit.Shit.

[ Barking ]
Nice doggy.

Hold still.Here we go.

Catch!
[ Guard Whistling ]

Right there!
Hurry.

[ Guard ] Why's he gotta tear up stuff?

Benzo Al, that you?

Yeah, man.
Come get your
crazy-ass dog.

[ Carmen ]
Hi.Dang.

Job like this,
you gotta amuse yourself.

Kind of like you, Benzo. Hi.

My man!
[ Grunts ]

Goddamn!

[ Benzo ] Remember me?

Oh, shit.Oh, shit!

Get the stuff!
Come on!

[ Dog Barking ]

I'm gonna kill him.

[ Elevator Dings ]Oh, God!

Hurry up, Freddy!I got you!
Got you.

Come on.

It's gettin' messy. What you wanna do?

Kill him!Yes!

[ Freddy ] What's up, 8-Ball? I know you're standing there lookin' at me.

I got your money.
Now what?
Don't kill him.

Catch 'im, don't kill 'im.

He's got my money.
$100,000 to whoever
catches Freddy.

Yo, Benzo!

Just catch him.
8-Ball wants him alive!

[ Elevator Bell Dings ]Go, go, go.

Carmen, I'm driving.
I'm driving!No!

Get in the damn car!

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Awesome!

[ Tires Screeching ] Oh, yeah!

Go! Go!
Go!

[ Shouting ]

No! The tire!
The tire!

Hey, man!
No, no, no!

Let 'em drive off!
He wants them alive!
He wants them alive, man!

[ Carmen Yells ] Pull over. There's a taxi.

Pull over!

Come on,
get in the taxi.

Yo!Hey, man!

Take us to the beach.[ Moaning ]
Oh, God!

Come on, let's go!

I can't go home.
My car's gone.
Freddy, I love that car.

Shit.
I should've never
sold you that suit.

[ Freddy ] Right here's cool, man.

Hey, thank you, my man.Thank you,sir.
Thank you.

That your family
right there?Oh, yeah.

Why don't you buy 'em
somthing nice, all right?

Mm. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

[ Woman ] Hey, you two are up bright and early.

How you doing today?Good morning.

Welcome to the Cadillac.
Can I have your name?

Dexter Banks.

Here. I've got something
for you, all right?

This is a hundred G's.
It should cover your car
and your crib.

I don't want 8-Ball's
dirty money, okay?

Nobody buys me, Freddy!

I don't want people comin' around lookin' for me!

I want out of this whole thing.
I want to get away from you...

and all your
crazy-ass friends.Okay, Carmen, stop!

Ain't nobody tryin'
to buy you, baby.

They owe you this money.
So take it.

Please.

You know what?
Let me try to put it to you
like this, okay?

I checked the Blue Book.
I wanna buy your big-ass,

fucked-up ride for $100,000.

Can I have it?
I love that car, Freddy.

I know you did,
but your shit is
a hooptie now, baby.

This is $100,000.
The car is mine.

I just want you to know,
it's worth every penny.

[ Scoffs ]

I got it. Hey, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

[ Sighs, Deeply ]
Thanks.

This is a spittin' image
right here.

Yeah.
That's my mom.

Oh, yeah?Mm-hmm.

She used to be
a wardrobe mistress
on Broadway.

And her favorite show
was Carmen.

Where's your son?

I saw that Big Wheel, girl.Oh, gosh!

He's back home
with my dad.

But I've given myself
one year.

Whether I make it or not,
he's coming home.

You know?

That's why I can't die.

I gotta be
a good mommy.

I know.[ Chuckles Softly ]

[ Sighs ]

I envy you.

You grew up surrounded
by everything that came
before you, Carmen.

I mean, like cousins.

I never had a cousin.

When I have kids, they're
definitely gonna have...

that one special ingredient
that makes it all right.

They're gonna have
a home, baby.

I just gotta find
the right woman, right?

[ Laughs ]

So now you think it's time
to romance me, huh?

No.

I think it's time
to say thank you.

I wanna thank you for
all your help. You really
came through for me.

And that doesn't happen
a lot in my life.

You're welcome.

Carmen,

diamonds are only
pieces of coal that
did well under pressure.

[ Laughs ]

So now you're comparing me
to a piece of coal?

No, no.
I said diamonds.

Diamonds.

Okay. I know you're trying
really hard.

And I appreciate that
in a man.

But you're still
sleepin' on the couch.Ahh!

A woman of principles,
is that what we are?

Yeah, that's right.

If you don't stand
for something,
you'll fall for anything.

Is that right?Mm-hmm.

What do you stand for,
Freddy?

What do I believe in?

Yeah.
What do you believe in?

I believe in diamonds.

[ Tapping Sound ]

[ Whirring Noise ]Good morning, Ricky.

Shh!

Mornin'...
Counselor.

Sorry to catch you
with your pants down.

How'd you
get in here?

Oh, I've always
had an aptitude
for things like that.

[ Laughs ]

Makes people
take me seriously.

What do you want?

I believe you lawyers
call it "due diligence."

You know, I checked
your shit out.

You're a lawyer
and a C.P.A. shingle.
Man, that's sweet.

You know, you are quite
an educated man.

You can do the deals,
then not have to testify
when the shit goes sour.

I need to know
whose side you're on.

Whose side? My side.
The only side.

Like Clint, I'm down for
"a fistful of dollars."

I'm my own man.

Whoo!
[ Laughs ]

Flip the script.

Now I'm your man.

The "item."

I need it found today...
in a very conspicuous manner.

Two birds, one stone.

Handle this right,

maybe you get another envelope
with a, uh, few dollars more.

But you mess it up...

and I'll send someone
to make you coffee.

In your house?
Can't have that, now,
can we?

[ Butt Hisses ]

Counselor.

Hey, you mind lettin' me out?

It's a tricky lock.

I'll be right back.

Sweep it up,
come on.Shut up.

Let's go.
Faster, faster!Hey, hey.

Where are you goin', man?
You've got yard work to do.

I'm goin' to the bank
to check out my balance.Okay, you're on the clock.

I'm borrowing this.
It belongs to you.Yes, sir.

When we rich,
it ain't gonna be like that.

[ Computer Buttons Beeping ]
Hey, my man!

Brother, you've been here five minutes.[ Laughing ]

I'm on my lunch break. What's taking you so long?

[ Khaleed ] Let me check my balance. This can't be right.

Twenty million.

[ Man ] Hey, brother! You finished yet or what?

[ Policeman ]
Get it?Look, that was a pro job.

That's right!
So it's not your jurisdiction.

I want you back
at the precinct.All right, but--

I want you here,
now!Yeah, I'm on it.

Where are you
right now?I will stay out of it.

I'm in the car now
headed over to the precinct.

Get here,
and I mean now!Ten minutes.

Move your ass.
Get here now!

Okay.

Freddy?

Freddy?

Just can't stop,
can you?

Damn.

Freddy!

Freddy, you better
wake your dumb ass up.

Blu-- Blusette.

[ Whimpering ] Blusette.

Dear God.
[ Crying ]

I told you, girl.
I told you.

What?Hotel Cadillac!

[ Gunshot ]

Venice.

[ Knock At Door ] [ Freddy ] Hey, Mr. Darren.

It's Freddy Roland, man.

You gotta talk to me, man. You gotta listen.

Mr. Darren!

Look, I've really got
to talk to you.Come on in.

Quite a party
last night, huh?
Whew.

Sit down.

So what's so important
it can't wait
till tomorrow?

Blusette is dead, Rick.

They murdered her.

Who is "they"?
8-Ball!

Rick, as soon as y'all close,

he's outta here,
you understand me?

What I need you to do
is call the police...

and tell them this.

Tell them this story.I can't call the police!
They won't believe me!

Why?
8-Ball put the body on ice
somewhere. I don't know.

This is really
farfetched, Freddy.

Come on, man!
They murdered my sister!

Why am I gonna lie
about something like that?

Look, I came here...

so you would stop
doin' business with 8-Ball.

If you're not careful,
the man is gonna piss on you.
You understand me?

I should be dead right now,
but I got somethin' he wants.

What's that?

I got $20 million.

[ Laughing ]

$20 million.
The plot thickens.

You've got $20 million?
That's right.
I've got $20 million.

The motherfucker's been bootleggin' vinyl copies of his own records!

He sells them to smaller stores
whose clientele
still want vinyl.

But he don't report
none of these sales.
None of them!

He takes the money,
puts it in offshore accounts
in foreign banks.

But I've got news
for you.

I got his shit, Rick.Where is it?

I put it someplace safe.

[ Sighs ]
All right, look.

I gotta go to a meeting,
all right?

I'm gonna help you,
Freddy.

I want you
to stay here.

Go upstairs.
My loft is up there.
Take a shower.

Do whatever you gotta do,
but relax.

When I get back,
I'm gonna take you
to the police station...

and we'll sort this out,
all right?

Well, well, well.
Hello, hello. Hmm?

What, are you goin'
somewhere? Are ya?

[ Screams ]Hey!
Where's your manners?

You never punch
a lady.

Slap the taste out
of her mouth so she knows
where the fuck you comin' from.

[ Whimpers ]

No, no!

Make it real.
So she knows this
ain't no cartoon.

Where's my money?

Hmm?
Give it up, baby girl.

This is-- This is
all he gave me.

Wipe my ass on that.

[ Carmen Sobbing ]
[ 8-Ball ]
I want the computer.

I don't know!
[ Laughing ]

I don't know! [ Sobbing ]

He didn't give it to me.
He didn't give it to me!

Come on.[ Crying ]

You fine.
Yeah.

Sexy, young tender rump.

A lot of things can happen...
to a young tenderoni
like yourself.

You think about that.

I'm gonna ask you
once again real slow.

Where the fuckis my money?

I don't know!

He left!

He didn't tell me
anything.

Oh, baby, I like you.

You're lucky, because
if Freddy had been here,

you would be dead
right now.

I'm a superstitious kind of person.

So I think
I'll keep you around.

Maybe we both get lucky
and find your boyfriend.

Hmm?

Tell you what, baby.
Let's write him a note.

[ Man Announcing  Basketball Game On TV ]

I'm Sam Rubin with a special report. We dispatched a crew to the Venice apartment...

where pop diva
Blusette Ford's body...

was found by local police
earlier today.

There's no official word
on the cause of death,

but foul play
and/or drug use
have not been ruled out.

Police are searching
for this man,

Miss Ford's foster brother,
Frederick Roland.

At this point, he's only wanted for questioning in connection to her death.

Take a look. Roland is
an African-American male.

Twenty-four years old,
six feet tall.

Weighing approximately
175 pounds.

Roland is an employee
of Rhythm Records,

the record label
where Blusette Ford
found so much success.

Miss Ford's manager,
Curtis "8-Ball" Harris, was
unavailable for comment.

Sources tell us
that Miss Ford
attended a party...

thrown by her label,
but has not been seen--

Stay tuned for more news
on the tragic death
of Blusette Ford...

and a retrospective
on the short life...

of this fallen star.

[ TV: Basketball Game
Continues ]

Look at that, man!
That's the game, dude!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

Look at that!
You can't stop 'em, man.

That's what I'm saying. That's how you play basketball.

You can't stop 'em.
They're "unfadeable."

You gotta coach
these things.
You can't stop 'em.

It doesn't make sense.
Look, another two
unanswered, man.

I'm gonna check
the homeboy.

Get back. Get back, baby!
You know what I'm sayin'?

[ Phone Ringing ]

Yo, he's cool.

Darren residence.
May I help you?

[ Marcus ] Yeah, I want sausage on that pie.

You're calling me 30 minutes after I had an order for that?

Kid, you better be here in five.

You're gonna take a buck
off my order for the question.

And another
for being late.

Knucklehead. Probably
wondering why he's still
delivering damn pizzas.

[ TV: Basketball Game  Continues ]

Yo. Yo!What's up?

I'm goin' to the bathroom.
Watch my boy.

[ TV: Basketball Game
Continues ][ Phone Ringing ]

[ Ringing Continues ]

Darren residence.
May I help you?

Yeah, dude.
Got your pizza downstairs.
Gonna let me in?

[ Man ]
Yo, kid, it's about time.
Be right down.

[ Toilet Flushing ]

[ 8-Ball ]
You blew it!

Look, man, I thought--You thought!

I don't pay you...
to "thought."

I do the thinkin'.

I thought I told you
to put her somewhere safe.

Don't touch me!
Don't you ever touch me!

[ 8-Ball ] Huh?

House, you know about this?
Dog, my name is Benny.
I ain't in it.

That's between y'all two.Look, man, I thought--

You thought again.
[ Whimpering ]

I thought, "If anybody gets hurt, let it be Freddy."

Let the police
get rid of him for us.
Fuck up his credibility.

Hey, dog, I'm cool with that,
man. Hey, he's right.

[ Chuckling ]

You ready for
the "dog and pony"?Long as I'm the pony.

This is Sal Visconti.How are ya?

Guy Marrotta.
These are my associates
from Las Vegas.

Gentlemen, Curt Harris.

Please.

My friends
call me 8-Ball.

Well...
[ Clears Throat ]

we're all aware
of recent events, so why
don't we cut to the chase?

We asked you here
because...

we have good news
and bad news.

The good news is, we still  want to buy your company.
That's good.

The bad news is...
there's been a slight change
in plans.

Well--
[ Clears Throat ]

[ Chuckling ]

Well... [ Clears Throat ]
that number should be coming up.

It's all set up.

It's like a license
to print money.

Blusette is worth more dead
than alive.

Not to us.

This is no longer
the win-win it was.
Now it's a gamble.

It's more like...
a favor.

[ Sighs ]

This is the "old wine,
new bottle" business.

I've got good wine,

but it's expensive.

Then we do it next year
when the dust settles.
But right now,

your problems make it
too rich for our taste.

You work it
for that number.

We're leaving town tomorrow. The offer's good till we go.

You're tryin'
to "gank" me.

Trying to strongarm me?

Let me tell you a story.If we want to hear a story,
we'll go to the library.

Picture this.
It's 1959.

Small-time--"Small-time composer
writes a song...

for Jackie Wilson."

Heard it before.

Gentlemen, perhaps
I should have a word
with Mr. Harris in private.

Yeah, do your thing.

That is a very good idea.
Good night.

Yeah, I think it is.

They're gonna walk
right now...

if you don't get
your hands off of me.

People get sued over contracts.
They get deadover handshakes.

Handshakes?

Handshakes denote trust...

as in "truthfulness."

Have you been truthful,
8-Ball?

Blusette Ford is dead.

And your heir apparent
is the prime suspect.

[ Sighs ]Basically your whole
organization is in shambles.

[ Chuckles ]

Now, personally, I wouldn't
bootleg my own records.

But since you did,
let's consider it an asset.

I want it.

I'll think on it.

There's nothing to think about.
You have no choice.

Done. Next?

Next?

You have to close out,
shall we say, old business.

Freddy.Yeah.

How do you propose
I do that?I'm gonna bring him to you.

You close him out,
I cash in.

Then we smoke, uh,
more Nat Shermans.

[ Sighs ]
Bring him on.Right.

And that other thing?

Let's keep that
between me and you.

Sort of like
silent partners.

Mute.

Beautiful.

Don't you forget
what I told you.I won't forget a thing.

Carmen?

Carmen!

You are missing
a great play-off game!

I bet I am.
I've got to check out now.
I need my briefcase.

Sure thing.
Did you have a nice stay
with us?

Yeah, it's a nice place.
I'm late for a plane.
We've got to do this now.

Okay, okay.

[ Gasps ]

You're that guy!Hey, shut up!

Get my briefcase out
of your safe. Let's go!
I don't have the key.

Find the key!
Find the key!

[ Alarm Rings ]
What are you do--

[ Screaming ]
It's him! It's him!

[ Alarm Ringing ]

It's the guy
who killed the singer!

Hey, boss.How's my ace
in the hole?

He's sleeping
like a baby, Rick.Good.

I'm gettin' ready to play
high-stakes poker.That's cool.

Aw, damn!
I can't believe this,
Mr. Darren.

I can't believe it!All right.

The man has vertigo.

And you're watchin' him.

But somehow he manages
to get out the window.

And you don't see it.

Do you see this?
[ Panting ]

Do you have any idea
what just went out that window?

Of course you don't.

But it's okay.

It's all right.

The game is still on.

Hey, Khaleed!

Khaleed!

Come on, man!

Yo, you all over
the news, kid!

I know, I know. Chill. Just let me in, all right?

Come around the back.

[ TV: Basketball Game ]

What's goin' on,
man?Just shut up.

Come here.
Look at me.

I didn't do that
to Blusette.

I know Dexter
was askin' about you.

I need your phone.

I need your phone.
Where's your phone?

Be quiet,
all right?

[ Phone Dialing ]

Detective Banks.Yo, man, it's me.

I'm at the kid's house.
I need you, Dexter.

I need you alone.
[ Dexter ] I'm on my way.

Don't do
nothin' stupid.Here.

I see you still got
my "jammy."

Yeah. I'm gonna need
this thing for a while.

It's cool.
I got plenty more.

I need you
to listen to me.

I put some money
in your account.

That was you?Yeah, that was me.

$20 million?Be quiet!

[ Yelling ]Shut up!
Shut your mouth.

Don't get excited.
I will be making a withdrawal.

You ain't makin' no--
Why can't you be quiet?

That was $20 million!Khaleel--
Goddamn!

[ Mumbling ]Shut your mouth.
All right?

Listen, I need you
to do something for me.
Quietly!

Want me to write you
a check?You're damn straight.

19.9. That leaves you
a hundred grand
for your car.

You make that
to me and Carmen Jones.

Write that, quietly.

You know what
we could do with--Write the damn check!

[ TV: Basketball Game ]

You and Miss Jones
definitely got a thing
goin' on, for sure.

You didn't tell nobody,
did you?

My man, I thought
the bank made a mistake.

I called 8-Ball to ask if he
could help me get it out--You told 8-Ball?

He wasn't in the office.
Chill.

I told Benzo.

[ Man Groaning ]

Nobody tells me nothin'!
What do you expect me to do?

[ Brakes Squealing ]

What's going--What's up, fool?

Sh-Shit.Get the laptop.

All I want is the laptop.

Give me the computer and you can step.

You've been smart so far.
Don't play stupid now. - [ Freddy ] I ain't got it.

Mister, where's my girl at?
Where's she at, man?

She's safe. Give it up. - [ Freddy ] Chill out with  the gun and I'll get it.

[ Gunman ] Let's go now.Don't turn around.

Don't shoot me.
I'm a cop, dude.

I'm a cop. I'm doin' it.
I'm cool.

[ Gunshots ]

[ Clicking ]

[ Clicking ]
[ Grunting ]

Oh, shit!
[ Dexter ] Get him!

[ Clicking ] All right, kid. Don't move. Just stand perfectly still.

That was
a good shot, dude.

I thought I jammed
the safety shut.

[ Tires Screeching ]

Damn, kid,
how many guns you got?

Gimme that.

Freddy, are you okay? [ Freddy ] Yeah, man.

One friend
deserves another.

Look, dude.

[ Crying ]
[ Mumbling ]

Take care of your people,
and call 911!

[ Dexter ]
Look at this.

[ Khaleed ] Yo, operator. You recognize him?

[ Freddy ] It's one of Rick Darren's guys.Who is Rick Darren?

That's a good
fuckin' question, man.

Freddy, what is with
this cryptic shit, dude?

First, there's no bodies,
then there's corpses
everywhere you go.

Will you tell me
what is goin' on?

I don't know, man.
I don't know.

All I know is I gotta get
over to the company.
They got my woman there.

They gonna kill her
if I don't get there soon!

Dexter,
I need your help.

Help you do what?
Get everybody else killed?

I need backup
for all these motherfuckers.

This is some
real-life shit here.
This ain't no action movie.

And in case you don't know,
you are wanted for murder.

I didn't have nothin' to do
with that, and you know that!

That's our sister Blusette,
man.

I promised this woman
I wouldn't let her die.

I'm sorry,
but you gotta put these cuffs on
and go downtown with me.

Dexter, listen to me, man.

There's a briefcase
at the Hotel Cadillac in Venice.

If some shit happens to me,
you go down there and get that.
All right?

It's under your name.
You listening to me?

[ Reporters Chattering ]

Her body was found here today...[ Reporter ] A victim
of an apparent struggle--

[ Rubin ] There was also sign of what police are calling an unrelated incident--

[ Chattering Continues ]

How'd you get in
this time?

The same way
I got in before.

What can I say?
I told you
I was from the Bronx.

[ Clears Throat ]
Look, Freddy,

I don't know why you're
aiming that gun at me.

I sent those guys here
to protect you.

Now, if I scared you,
that was wrong.

Oh, you were wrong?
Well, you were wrong about
something else, Rick.

What's that?
I don't think we gonna
be friends, my man.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Who the fuck are you?
For real!

I'm just a lawyer.

Yeah, you're just
a lawyer, right?

Somehow I think you're
the lawyer that's gonna get
me out of all this shit.

Pick that phone up and call him.

You call 8-Ball right now.
Call him!

Tell him we're making a switch.
You for the girl.

Call him, Rick!

All right.
No problem.

Oh, sh--

Oh, shit. Come on, Freddy! Come on, Freddy!

[ Panting ]

God, please grant me
the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change.

And the courage to change
the things that I can.

[ Tires Screeching ]

[ Groaning ]

And the wisdom to know
the fuckin' difference!

What's up, baby?
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

You thought you were
goin' somewhere, didn't you?

Put your hands where I can see 'em!

Don't move.

[ Phone Dialing ]

[ 8-Ball ]
Yeah?Hey, what's up, boy?

This is young Freddy.
I got me company, man.
Say somethin'.

Hello, 8-Ball.That's enough.
We comin'.

All right, park the car,
put your hands up.

Don't even think
about movin', man.

Get out of the car slowly.
Slowly, Rick.

All right, come on.
What are you doin'?

I just wanna get
my jacket, Freddy.

Slowly. Come on, man.
Don't make me kill you.

You don't mean shit to me.
I want my girl.

Slowly.

Good evening,
gentlemen.

[ Guard ] 8-Ball,
they're comin' up.Security. A good sign.

Don't even think about movin'.
Don't even think about it.

Rick, you're in
this Blusette murder
with 8-Ball, aren't you?

Who, me?

I've been lookin'
all over for this.

I didn't know it was yours!
You left it there?

You're a smart kid, Freddy.
That's why I like you.

See if you can
keep up with this.

Once upon a time,
there was a child named Rico.

He was named after
the racketeering law
the Feds got his old man with.

See, Daddy wanted
to name me...

after the only thing
badder than he was.

Rico.
"Rick" for short.

Do you see this?
Do you see it?

This is the only thing my
father could afford to leave me
after 8-Ball dicked him.

This whole fucking building
should be mine!

Just one snag.
No. My sister wanted out.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
The diva wanted out.

See, I would've
lost my backing.

I secretly arranged a meeting.
Made her an offer
she couldn't refuse.

But guess what.
She refused, Freddy.

She refused!No.

You killed my fuckin' sister!
You killed her! Huh?

Well, now that you know,

why don't we cut this
face-off bullshit out?No!

Come on, Freddy. Come on.
You don't want to shoot me.

No!We're the same.

Your sister, my father.
Come on.

I'll give you your own label.
Your dream, Freddy.No! Fuck you!

Just like me![ Clicking ]

Fuck you!

Rick. Rick?

Come on.
Come on, Rick.

Don't shoot me, man.

God! Come on.
Wasn't my sister enough?

My father was enough!

I had nothing to do with that!
It was 8-Ball!

Two wrongs
don't make it right, Freddy.
But they sure do make it even.

[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

[ 8-Ball ]
Big things, baby.

Carmen, are you okay?
Never too big.

To say hello.

[ Freddy ]
Jesus!

You want
your little bitch?

It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

You think you can just
walk in here and beat me?

I told you,
I stays on the table.

You're a loser,
just like your damn daddy.

[ Gasping ]
Benzo!

[ Benzo ]
Yeah. Showtime.

What you doin', man? - [ Benzo ] You should've broke  a brother off a piece, man.

You should've looked out
for a brother.
What you doin'?

Get yo' faggot ass up, Freddy.
You comin' with me.

Slow your roll, man. We family.
We grew up together.
What's wrong with you?

Check yourself, brother.

Check myself, 8-Ball?

[ 8-Ball ] We can work this out. It ain't nothin' but paper.

Enough paper can
take care of anything.
Just check yourself.

Check it? Huh?
Don't move!
Benzo--

That's the way it's gonna be?
That's the way it is, man.

I'm gonna get mine, man!
You got yours,
so I'm gonna take mine.

Don't do this! Shut the fuck up!

Like your man says,
"You're nobody till
somebody kills you."

Don't do it. Don't do it!
Let's do this.

That's the way it is!
Don't do this, motherfucker!

Take this!
[ No Audible Shooting ]

[ Crying ]

I loved her, too, Freddy.

I, I--
[ Groans ]Jesus, what a mess.

Never too big.
[ Gasping ]

[ Phone Ringing ]

[ Phone Ringing ]

[ Freddy ]
You must've found me,
big brother.

Damn right I found your ass.
I'm a Detective.

No, you mean your ass
usedto be a Detective.

[ Chuckles ]
What's up?

I just called
to tell you...

that Khaleed made
number one today.

[ Dexter ]
And seeing that this is
your record company,

I thought you should know
we're winnin'.

We are winning.

We just won, kid.
We just won.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

Everything all right
