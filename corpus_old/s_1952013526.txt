GIRL: Okay, now, sit.

Stay. Good.

Shake your paw.

Good girl.
(second girl laughs)

Okay, now, lie down.

Now, sit. Sit.

Good girl.

Good. Now, stay.

Come!

Aw, yuck! Gross!

(tire bursts)
Ray, quick, duck!

PASSENGER:
I knew it! We got a flat.

DRIVER: There's a can of that
quick tire fix in the back.

PASSENGER:
Okay. Tire fix.

DRIVER: Kosh,
come on, come on, come on.

(driver laughing)

Kosh, we made a great haul
this time!

This one painting alone

is gonna bring me in at least
a quarter of a mill...



Kosh!

Yeah?

There's a dog in the truck!

Oh, you mean puppy.

Puppy?
Shh!

DRIVER:
Well, whatever it is...

...what is it doing
in the truck?

KOSH: Well, he seemed cute.
I snagged him at the last hit.

Thought we could use
some company.

DRIVER: Get rid of him!
KOSH: What?

DRIVER: Now!

Go on. Get. Get.

I'm sorry.

GIRL: Oh, no!

(truck horn blares)

Sal, look out!

Sal, you saved him.

(Puppy whimpers)

(bell tolls)

SAL: Come on or we'll be late.
Let's take the shortcut.

RAY: We're not allowed, Sal.
If Mother Agnes finds out...

She can't see us
all the way out here.

We've got to this time.

Wait up!

(bell tolling)

RAY: But what about
Mother Agnes?

The puppy?

We're not gonna leave him here,
and we're not gonna tell her.

NUN: God bless you.

Do you think we'll ever
get 'dopted, Sal?

Probably not.

Mostly people just want little kids.

Bye, Chelsea.

Okay, now, run!

NUN: Ahem!
Excuse me!

You two young ladies
are very late for afternoon meal.

Now, you'd better get up
to the dining hall right away.

Yes, Mother Agnes.

(girls laughing and talking)

Eww.

MOTHER AGNES:
Good day, sisters.

NUN: Mother Agnes!

(low bark)


Sal, you got a puppy!
Shh!

(puppy barks softly)

You might like to salt that.


Oh, no! Ray!

What?

Aah! Mouse!

(girls screaming)
(puppy barking)

Girls!
Aah! Mouse!

Eww! Eww, mouse!

(puppy barks)
RAY: Come on.

Girls!

(puppy barks)

(Ray chuckles)

(girls screaming)

GIRLS: Mouse! Mouse!

Sister Helen, go and see
what those two are up to

while we deal with this chaos.

Yes, Mother Agnes.

Girls! Girls!

Where the dickens? Ohh!

SISTER HELEN:
Girls? Girls!

(panting for breath)

Quick, the drawer!

(panting for breath)

Mom!

I thought I'd lost it.

Oh! Ohh!

Ray, hurry!

SISTER HELEN:
Excuse me,

but did anyone give you
permission to leave?

We're scared of mice.

Oh, well, you'll be happy to know
there aren't any, then.

And you can just trot yourselves
right back down there

and wait to be excused
like everyone else.

Yes, sister.
Yes, sister.

Hmph. Hmph.

Ptooh!

(puppy whimpers)
(Sister Helen gasps)

Huh.

(puppy barks softly)

(Sister Helen gasps)


(puppy yaps)
Ohh!


SAL: Janey, you have to promise
not to tattle.

ALL: Ohh! It's so cute!

Oh, it's true!
You do have a puppy!

JANEY:
What about Mother Agnes?

Sarah, you'd better
go watch the door.

Sal, you've been waiting your whole life
to get a puppy, haven't you?

I'm naming him Chestnut
'cause he's brown and little.

GIRL: He's so cute!

Where'd you get him?

He was in the bushes!

Sister Helen said
if we prayed and prayed...

She's coming!
Sister Helen's coming!

SISTER HELEN: Girls!
Girls, it's 8:00!

It's past your bedtime!

You don't want me to have to
get Mother Agnes up here, do you?

ALL: No.

SISTER HELEN:
That's what I thought.

Let's say a prayer for Chelsea.

Close your eyes.

Both of them.

Dear Lord,

our Chelsea has left
the orphanage today,

and we pray that she may find
great happiness in her new home.

Amen.

GIRLS: Amen.
RAY: Amen.

SISTER HELEN:
Good night, girls.

GIRLS: Good night,
Sister Helen.

Don't let the bedbugs bite.

Sal...

why does she always
have to say that?

I think she thinks it's funny.

(puppy yelps)

Hello?
(gasps)

(mimicking barking)

Woof! Woof!

(girls mimic barking)

Oh, now, hush.

Precious, aren't they, Lord?

Sal...

do you think God knew?

Sister Helen says
he hears everything.

Shh.

Sal...

it's dark tonight.

Sal?

Yes, you can get in my bed.

(dog whimpers softly)

What now, Ray?

I can't believe you finally got a dog.

I know. Me neither.

Sal...

Yes, Ray?

Good night.

Good night.

SAL: (giggling)
Ches!

(puppy yelps)

Okay, now, sit.


See? You're a smart little fellow.

I think maybe I can
teach you a few things.

Okay, now, lie down.

Ah, you silly fellow!

(bell tolling)

(bell tolling)

(Ray sobbing)

Sal, where did you go?

I took Chestnut out to the field.

Don't do that, Sal.

Don't go without me.

I didn't know where you were.

Don't worry. I'll never leave
without you, okay?

Okay?

(girls talking)

GIRLS: Uh-oh.

Mother Agnes?

She never comes to breakfast.

Sally Ann and Ray,
please stand up.

My office, now.

GIRL: What'd they do?
GIRL #2: I don't know.

Janey?

I didn't!
I didn't tell!

Pinky swear.

Now, I've brought
you both here because...

something very out of the ordinary
has happened here.

We know... but it's not Sal's fault.

I've been praying every night,

except for some nights
when I'm really tired,

for Sal to get a d...
Oww!

(Chestnut yapping softly)


I'll get to the point.

You... two... sisters...

have been adopted.

You mean...

you found our mother?

Ray...

she means they found us
a home.


(barking softly)

The Tomleys,
who you've met several times,

have decided to adopt you both,

and you'll be moving to
their home in New York City.

A mom and a dad?

We never had both before.

MOTHER AGNES:
Well, you are two very lucky girls, then.

SAL: Mother Agnes?

MOTHER AGNES:
Yes, what is it?

SAL: I was wondering...

do people in New York City
have dogs?

Frogs?

Oh, my goodness gracious...

No, dogs.

D-O-G-S.

MOTHER AGNES:
Girls, have I not made it clear?

You are both going to a family.

That means there is a mother
and a father who have decided...

Faint.
What?

Pretend to faint.

What on earth does this
have to do with dogs?

Ohh!

Mother Agnes, Ray's fainted.
I'll get water.

Oh, my word! Ohh!

Ray? Oh, wake up, sweetie.

Wow. Thank you, Mother Agnes.
I feel much more better now.

Hmm.

(splash)
Oh!

Ugh! Ohh!

WOMAN: And Mrs. Bartlett,
this will be the girls' room.

They like to dance?

Oh, you know,
I-I don't really know.

I just know that I did
as a girl.

Says here they like animals.

Yes. I was thinking about
taking them to a pet store.

But we're going to buy them
each a fish.

Hmm?

My husband's allergic to animals...
cats... dogs...

Ones with hair?

Yeah.

Keep this in a secure spot.

It's the final piece
of documentation you need

for the adoption to become complete.

And remember to call me
when concerns come up.

Sometimes adjustment can be
very hard for orphans at this age.

Okay. Thank you.

Congratulations.

Thanks.

But you can't leave.

We'll miss you.

When you're adopted,
you have to go.

It's the law...

but you can come to visit.

What about Chestnut?

Are you gonna take him?

I'll figure out a way.

WOMAN:
Here's to Laura and her new life...

motherhood!

Whoo!

(heavy accent)
Motherhood! Motherhood!

Everybody, this is Rosamaria.

I just hired her to help me
with the apartment and with the girls,

and she's gonna go full time
when I come back after the New Year.

Wow. Welcome, Rosamaria.

She doesn't really speak English, so...

Oh, uh...

ROSAMARIA: Salud!
ALL: Salud!

MAN: See?
She understands me!

So, come on, tell us...
when's the big day?

Well, the social worker just gave us
our final documents,

and the girls are going
to come tomorrow!

ALL: Ohh!

Girls! Manana! Girls!

Girls!

(all laughing)

Sal...

Shh. He's sleeping again.

Sal, are you scared?

No.

Sal... what do
a mom and dad do, really?

Take kids to school...

make 'em food
and stuff like that.

That's it?

Will they kiss us?

No.

Janey said they will.

That's 'cause she's just
trying to scare you.

Sal...

Ray, it's time to go
to sleep now, okay?

Sal?

Yes?

We're going to be a family now.

TV ANNOUNCER: To Jamie Simons
with tonight's top story.

SIMONS: Last night's break-in
brings the total to

15 West Side apartments
that have been burglarized

in the last three months.

Mr. Trundle, owner of Trundle Properties,
is here with us now.

Mr. Trundle, what are your thoughts
on these burglars?

They've hit quite a few
of your buildings.

Well, I imagine it's
only natural for them to, uh,

target the finest buildings
in New York.

Honey?

Which one?

Oh, um... well, you know, honey,
I think either one will be fine.

Yeah?
Uh-huh.

No, you know, I think the blue one is
friendlier, you know? What do you think?

Wh-what do you think?

Yeah, I think you're right.
I think the blue one's friendlier. Thanks.

SIMONS: They appear to be
highly skilled thieves.

The media has nicknamed these criminals
the Central Park Robbers

because they seem to be targeting

exclusive apartment buildings
around the park,

and then using the park
as an escape route.

Mm-hmm.
They certainly do.

Make no mistake about it.

These criminals are
the lowest scum of society.

Hey, Uncle Wes, come here.

Who is this guy?
I mean, he doesn't like us.

They will be apprehended soon.

That is Thomas Trundle.

I've decided to offer
a $50,000 reward

for any information leading to
the capturing of these thugs.

Mr. Trundle is offering
a $50,000 reward...

Oh, no. Nobody puts
a bounty on my head.

No, we're gonna have to give him
a real reason not to like us.

Oh, yeah!
You show 'em, Uncle Wes!

From now on,
we only hit Trundle buildings.

Honey.

Maybe this is better
than the blue?

Oh, honey, that... that is...
that's the one.

You look...
you look stunning.

I have never been so nervous
in all my life.

What if they don't like us?

Sweetheart...
Ohh.

Relax. You're gonna be...
a wonderful mother.

Come on, girls!
Chop chop!

The Tomleys are here.

Don't forget to write us.

But we don't got stamps.

Come on, now.
Step lively, girls.

Hi.

Hey, Ray.

Hi, Sal.

Hi, Mrs. Tomley.

Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Tomley.


Oh, Matt.


She kissed me!

Come here.


I knew I couldn't do this
without tears.

Well... well, thank you
very much, Mother Agnes.

You're welcome.

Yeah, so, you girls
ready to go?

All right.

Let me help you with these.
Thanks.

(Chestnut yelps softly)

And... and you'll hold on
to that one.

Come on.
Goodbye, girls.

GIRLS: Bye!
MOTHER AGNES: Goodbye, girls.

MOTHER AGNES:
Bye-bye, girls.

GIRLS: Bye, Sal!
Bye, Ray!

MATT: Thank you!

GIRL: Bye, Ray.
We'll miss you.

NO SECRETS:


nah-nah (music)


here I am (music)




Oh, Sal, look.

Can we show them?

Show them what?
Ches.

They have to get to know us first.

Ah-choo!

Matt, you've been sneezing
the whole way home.

Matt has allergies.

Actually,
he's allergic to animals,

but the worst ones of all
are cats and dogs.

(Laura chuckles)

It's the dander, I think.

MAN: Hey, have a little
respect, here! Take it easy!

Not today, fellas.

Ah-choo!

MATT: Man!

Is that the President?

No, sweetie, that's Mr. Trundle.
He owns the building.

Yeah, and lots of buildings
in downtown New York,

including the tallest building.

Ah-choo!

And that's Marty.

Hello, Mrs. T.
Hey, Marty.

Hey.

Hey, there!

MATT: Ah-choo!

LAURA: Marty, this is Ray and Sal,
our girls we were telling you about.

Hey! Welcome
to the Big Apple, girls.

Can I take your bags for you,
little one?

BOTH: No, thanks.

Okay.

Sorry about the commotion,
Mr. Tomley.

There was another robbery
at one of Trundle's buildings last night.

They wanted to interview him again.

No dogs allowed?

LAURA: Thanks.

RAY: Ohh!

(soft yelp)

RAY: Sal, look at this place!

LAURA: Ooh!
It's okay. Come in.

Ah-choo!

LAURA:
Welcome to your new home.

It's "gi-normous"!

Ah-choo!

Where's he gonna go?

Ah-choo!
Oh, honey.

I know.

Well, um... why don't I
show you your room?


So... what do you think?

This is our room?

Mm-hmm.

We can change the color,
if you'd like.

(music box plays)

No. This color's nice.

Oh! I forgot!

The best feature
of the whole apartment...

your very own balcony.

Whoa!

Sal! A place to poop!

Yeah!

Um...

no, your bathroom is over here.



(Ray giggles)

Your bathroom.

Oh. One last thing.

Follow me.

And this is your closet.

A room just for clothes?

Mm-hmm.

But we don't have
that many clothes.

One drawer each is enough.

Oh, no, I went out, I bought you
some clothes and some pajamas

that you could wear
until we have time to go shopping.

So...

What's our schedule?

Schedule?

For dishes, laundry, and stuff.

Oh, no, no.
You don't have a schedule.

This is your home now,

so, um, I'll do the laundry,

and we can just do
the dishes together, okay?

Oh.

Well, uh, you girls
have had a long day,

so... ahem... why don 't you
get settled,

and, uh... we'll be outside
if you need anything.

Okay?

All right, then.

(Chestnut whimpers)

Sal, we've gotta stay.

I know it's nice, but...

we can't stay.

There's no dogs allowed.

Sal, please can we stay?

(girls giggling)

They sound so happy.
(Matt chuckles)

That's a lot of soap, Sal.

Well, if we're gonna stay,
he has to be clean.

It's the dander that makes
Mr. Tomley sneeze.

Really? You mean it, Sal?
We can stay?

Yeah. I think he likes it here.

I hope this fits.

Well, you know, don't worry.
I'm sure she'll grow into it.

So, how’s your design coming?

Oh, it's good. I've just...
I've got to get these plans done

so the model can get started.

(girls giggling)

Oh! He has a mustache, Sal!

Ooh, he smells good.

That's where Trundle lives.

In the penthouse, of course.

Let's hit it tonight, huh, Uncle Wes?
Come on, let's hit it. Can we hit it?

Kosh, patience! Caution!

Nah. The penthouse is gonna
require a little bit of planning.

It'll have high-tech security systems,
private entrance.

Nah, we're gonna have to do
our homework on this one.

Right.
We'll get to it...

but not till we're good and ready.

(girls giggling)

(girls giggling)

Maybe I should go tuck 'em in.
I think you should.

Who is it?

L-it's Laura.

Laura who?

The Mrs. Tomley Laura.

Oh!

Uh, come in.

Hi.

Just... just making sure
everything's okay in here.

Yeah. Everything's fine.

I sure am tired.

Well, um, you just come wake us
if you need anything.

Okay?
'Kay.

Okay, girls.
Good night.

(sighs heavily)

(Chestnut whimpers softly)
(door opens)

(Sal gasps)
The light.

Good night.

(Chestnut whimpers softly)

(relieved sigh)

SAL: Ow.

Ray, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

It's the same as the day,
just... darker.

Well, I don't know that yet, Sal.

Okay. Good night.

RAY: Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

WOMAN: How are ya?

LAURA: Girls!

SAL: Coming!

Okay, Chestnut, you be good.

You stay here
until we get back, okay?

RAY: And maybe
we'll bring you a treat. Bye.

(girls giggling)

LAURA: Mrs. Bartlett said
that they're gonna want

to create their own space.

She said it was part of
their acclimatization period.

Yeah, see, I don't think
it's a problem.

I think we just give them
what they need.

(girls giggling)

(footsteps resounding)

Hellooooo!

BOTH: Helloooo!


Sal, my boot!

Don't worry, I'll get it.

Oh, no!

Don't worry.
We'll get you another pair.

But, Sal...!

Mom didn't just wear boots, Ray.

She only wore them when
she worked with the horses.

RAY: Eww.

That was delicious.
May I have another?

Uh, well, sure.
Sure you can.

One more, please.

I don't see him, Sal!

I think he's gone.

SAL: (laughing)
Oh, Chestnut!

You are here.

(knock at door)
LAURA: Girls!

RAY: Uh... um...

Just a minute!

Um, you can come in now.

Oh, hey, girls.
Um, I was thinking tomorrow...

Wow! Looks like you girls
have a lot of laundry you need done.

Why don't I take that...
No! No, no, no, no!

SAL: We like to do
our own laundry.

Yes, we'll do it.

No, that's okay.
I don't mind.

No! No, no, no, no!

SAL: It's fine, really.

We love to do our own laundry.

We love. We love. Mm-hmm.

Oh. Okay.

Um, tomorrow, um,
I was thinking

that I could introduce you girls
to New York.

Great.

(whimpers softly)

KOSH: It's hot! It's hot!

KOSH: Hey, hey, hey!
DRIVER: Watch it, there, buddy!

WOMAN: Last night,
the Central Park Robbers struck again,

and police believe they may have used
this very path where I stand now.

The girls already eat?

Well, they came and took
a box of Cheerios,

but I guess they wanted
to eat them in their room alone.

Ah-choo! Man!

Wow! Your allergies
have really come back.

I'm gonna... I'm gonna go see
Dr. Martin later.


Okay.

(Sal giggles)

Girls, are you ready?

SAL: Chestnut, we'll be back.
You be good.


LAURA: Okay! Ready?

Las ninas!

LAURA: Rosamaria!

Girls, this is Rosamaria,
the lady I was telling you about.

Rosamaria,
this is Ray and this is Sal.

Okay!

Let's go, girls.

New York City awaits us.

Bye!

(blows whistle)

Unh-unh!

(humming softly)

Ah-ah-ah-choo!

Aw, gee, I'm sorry.

Whoa!

(indistinct chatter)

SAL: Hi! Hi, everybody!

Girls!


Ohh!

Ratas!

LAURA: Hello?

Oh, you are such a cutie!

(excited chattering)


Hmm!

Ohh! Rats!



Ay!

Welcome home, ladies.
Long day?

Oh, yes.

Rosamaria, hi!

Ay!

(speaking Spanish)

Rat! Rat! Ay!

(speaking Spanish)

Rats?

Rats?

I don't know about you girls,
but I'm tired.

SAL: Oh, no.

What's the matter, sweetie?

I have to use the toilet.

Me too.

'Kay.

(Chestnut yaps softly)

SAL: Ches!

(barks softly)




Hmm?

Sal!

Where's Ches?


What was that?

Sal... what are you doing?

Um... uh...

Hmm.

Well...

Well, I guess this is also part of
the acclimatization period

Mrs. Bartlett was talking about.

Ah-choo!

He's gonna have to
stay out here now.

RAY: Okay.


Exercise'll help, too.

I heard about the cockroach
in your kitchen.

What's up with that?
A cockroach in New York?

MARTY: Listen,
I'll take care of it, I promise.

SAL: The coast is clear.

NIKKI CLEARY:

felt the same way (music)

three nights ago (music)

you don't know which way (music)





Sal and Ray wrote us!
They wrote us!




(music) Faster than the speed of light (music)
Ah-choo!


Ah-choo!
(music) You don't want to hear from me (music)


(music) Tell me, then, what... (music)
Honey?



Trick or treat!

Well, hello!


oh, what love is for (music)

Ahh!

this love alive? (music)


SAL and RAY:
9-Mississippi, 10-Mississippi.

Ready or not, here we come!








He's getting pretty big, Sal.


RAY: Oh, wow!




LAURA: Bye, Rosamaria!

We'll be back soon!

Hmm?
(speaking Spanish)

Hmm.

Hmm.

(Chestnut barks)
Aah! No! No!

No! No!
Please! Please!

Aah! No! No!

MARTY: Ohh!

Is there anything left?

RAY: Not if you were planning
to get dresses.

LAURA: School uniforms.

MARTY: You girls
are startin' school.

'Fraid so.
The time has come.

Thanks, Marty.

Hi, Rosamaria!

Missy!

LAURA: Hi, we're back!

Listen, girls, I have to go
to work for a little while,

so Rosamaria's
going to give you dinner, okay?

So, I'll be back later.
Have fun. Bye!

Aah!

Ay, ninas!

Help!

RAY: Oh, no!
Ninas, help!

Rosa?
Ches?

SAL: Ray, turn it off.

RAY: Uh-oh.
SAL: Wrong way!

Ninas!

No!

Ches!

Oh, it's all right, Rosamaria.

He's very friendly.

Yeah, he doesn't bite.

His name's Chestnut.

(Spanish accent)
Cheese-newt?

Rosamaria, we...

go to school.

Ah, escuela.

And he... needs to go...

to the park.

Park?

To poop!

Oh, poop!

Yeah. Poop in the park.

Oh, poop!

But... nooooo...

dogs... allowed.

RAY: (playing)
Hey, let me out!

Ohh!

I have one thing to say.

Air holes!

You see,
we couldn't leave him behind.

Mother Agnes would never let him
stay at the orphanage,

and Sal has been waiting
her whole entire life to get a puppy.

ROSAMARIA:
Shh shh shh.

Hello, missy!

I'm gonna be there around two.
I'm in here!

Hello, missy.
Hi.

(speaking Spanish)

Can you hold on one second?

(speaking Spanish excitedly)

You went to Central Park!

Um, yeah.
We went to the park today,

and, um, we all played chase.

Rosa's fast, and we couldn't
catch up to her.

Ay, si, senora.

(speaking Spanish)

...woof woof!

Woof woof?

How you see, uh,
Cheese-newt?

SAL: She's trying to
tell you that, um...

we saw so many dogs...
that's 'woof woof'...

at the park today,

and on the way back,
um, she bought us some chestnuts.

Si, missy.
Chestnuts.

SAL: Some chestnuts.

Ay, ay!
Late, late, late, late!

Bye-bye! Bye!

Bye!

Mmm!

(Ray giggles)

NO SECRETS:



32 pairs of shoes (music)


Ah-choo!

a lot of things (music)




RAY: Ches!
SAL: Chestnut, no!

SAL: Chestnut, stop!
RAY: Ches!


the whole day through (music)


it's true (music)



the whole day through (music)

push all your buttons (music)





RAY:

NO SECRETS:





the whole day through (music)

push all your buttons (music)



Cheese-newt, go! Go!


Good!


SAL: Ches!

I think we're feeding him too much.

(garbage can crashes)

(alley cat yowls)

WES: Shh! Shh!

WES: Okay, give me
the grappling gun.

Stand back.

KOSH: Bingo.
Hey, it's fun.

It's like that spider guy.

(low growl)

WES: Get your knee off my leg,
you klutz!

Get off of me!
Ohh!

Okay.

Ohh! Shh... shh!

(drafting table squeaks)

KOSH:
I got it, I got it.

Stop it!

(low growl)

(low muttering)

(Chestnut barks)

WES: Nice doggie.
KOSH: Just us, pup!

We don't want to hurt you.

Aah!

Wes, I'm sorry!

SAL: Ches?
WES: Get me outta here!

Uh...! Uh...!
Easy, easy!

(loud crash)

The girls!

(Chestnut growls)
KOSH: Aah!

Ohh! Oh!

Let... go!

WES and KOSH: Whoooaaa!

Ches!

MATT: Sal! Ray!

Oh, no.

MATT: Ray.

Oh, no.

It wasn't Ray that did this.

See, we have this...

No!

It was me.

I did do it, Ray.

I did, Sal.

I was trying to get a pencil,
and I felled.

Oh, sweetie, why?
What's wrong?

MATT: Ah-choo!

(Wes coughing)
(alley cat yowls)

WES: What happened?
What happened?

KOSH:
There was a dog!

I will, thank you.
Thanks for your help.

Okay. Bye.

Hey, how are they?

They're finally sleeping.

Was that Mrs. Bartlett?

Yeah. Her take on it
is to just give them time.

She thinks it's good
we're starting them in school.

She thinks the regime will help.

Yeah, well,
she's probably right.

It's gonna be fine.

Oh, Cheese-newt,
I love you!



GIRLS: Chestnut!


GIRLS: Chestnut, stop!





(music) You will never let me go (music)
ROSAMARIA: Girls! Girls!

Hmm? Hmm?!

SAL: Wait! No! Ches, stop!

I'm getting mad at you, Ches!

Stooooooop!

No, no, no!

How many doctors does it take?

One... two...

Come on, Ches!
Girls, play!

RAY: Ches!

ROSAMARIA:
Oh, Cheese-newt, you so funny.



Cheese-newt!

Yo comiste mi helado!

(girls laugh)

Ohh! Ohh!

without you? (music)



(Sal laughing)
RAY: Whoa, Ches!


(both chuckling)


Ches!



Cinderella,

dressed in yellow...

(Rosamaria laughs)

Now I know we're
feeding him too much.

Do we have to tell 'em, Sal?

It's time.

Tonight at dinner.
Okay.

Hey, girls!

Mom, look at what I made you!

Wow!

I mean... um... Mrs...

No, no, no.
That's okay.

You can call me Mom.
In fact, I would feel honored.

Let's see.
Let's put it on.

Perfect.

Ohh!

Thank you!
All right, let's go home.

WOMAN: Place for the town car.
MAN: Oh, no. Move it.

MARTY: Most of the guests have
arrived, sir, including the mayor.

They await you inside.

Thank you.

Madame.

once all the guests have settled in,

we sneak up
to Trundle's penthouse.

He'll be busy at the wedding,
and we'll own the place.

Literally.
Here he comes.

Mr. Trundle!
(mutters angrily)

What?

WES: (whispering)
All right, he's in. Let's go.

SAL:
Do you like surprises?

LAURA:
Yeah, I love surprises.

RAY: Really big surprises?

LAURA:
Yeah, absolutely.

SAL: Good, 'cause we have
a surprise for you after dinner.

(Chestnut growls softly)
Shh, Cheese-newt.

Shh!

Ohh! Party?

MARTY:
Yes, Rosamaria.

Mr. Trundle's one and only niece
got married today.

We're hosting the reception for her
here at the Maverick.

Oh, look, girls,
it's Rosamaria!

And she has your Halloween costume.

Shh! Ches!


Surprise!
Oh, no!

WES: Come on, Kosh!
Move it!

Oh, no!

(guests chattering)

Whoa! Look out!

Huh?
Ohh!

GIRLS: Ches, stop!

SAL: Wait! Ches!

RAY: Oh, I'm sorry!

LAURA: Oh, no!
RAY: Ches!

(Chestnut barking)

No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

Ay!

Aah!

MAN:
For Pete's sakes!

MAN: Aah!
KOSH: Sorry!

WES: Look out! Look out!
Go, go, go, go, go!

(barking)
MAN: Stop that dog!

GIRLS: Ches, come back here!
Ches! Come on!

SAL: Ches, no!
WES: Come on!

Ohh, my cake!

Ohh!
RAY: Sorry!

Marty, grab that dog!

MARTY: Got him!

GIRLS: Sorry!

SAL: Chestnut!
RAY: Ches!

WES: Hurry up!

Let's go!

Marty, what's
the meaning of this?

W-well, I...

Get this dog out of here now!

(bride weeping)

Ohh, my wedding!


ROSAMARIA: (crying)
Ohh!

"Huge-mongous" mess!

Hey.

Ah-choo!

Ah-choo!

Yeah.

WES: That was close.
Dumb mutt almost ruined it for us!

Dumb mutt!

All right. We give it another day,

we come back tomorrow night
after Trundle's gone to sleep.

So, um...

let me...
let me get this straight.

This... this dog...

has been living here since...
since you girls arrived?

Yeah.

Ah-choo!
Excuse me.

Look, Mr. Tomley,
dogs are definitely not permitted,

in this or any of my buildings,
for that matter.

Either this... this beast is out of here
by tomorrow morning,

or all of you had better find
another place to live.

Am I clear?
Mr. Trundle.

No exceptions.

It's the dog or you, Mr. Tomley.

Ah-choo!

(girls crying)

I'm sure that we can find someone

who would be very kind
and very loving towards Ches.

But this is Sal's dog.

He's not supposed to live
with somebody else.

LAURA: Sweetie...

I don't know what to say.

(door closes)


Laura, we have to find
a different solution.

Like it or not,
he's part of the family now,

and we have to, uh,
we have to stick together.

He's gotta...
he's gotta stay.

Oh, Matt.

But, hey, look,
keeping those girls happy

is more important
than keeping this apartment, right?

I mean, besides,
there's always other apartments.

What about your allergies?
Oh, it's not the end of the world.

I'm sure there's...
there's something I can take.

At least now we know what it is.


Okay. We'll tell them
in the morning.

MATT: Okay.

That is the biggest dog
I have ever seen!

Come on, Ches, come on.

Sal?

She's gone!
She's gone without me!

Sal?

We don't know when she left.

Our doorman Marty
said he didn't see her,

and he started work around 7:30.

Don't worry, Mrs. Tomley.
We'll find her.

Thank you, Detective Benneson.
I'll... I'll see you out.

Excuse me, have you
seen this little girl?

I'm talkin' to everyone that walks by,
spreadin' the word.

We'll find her.
Thank you, Marty.

LAURA: Sal! Sal!
RAY: Ches! Chestnut!

ROSAMARIA: Cheese-newt!

ALL: Sal!

RAY: Chestnut!

ROSAMARIA:
Cheese-newt!

MATT: Sal?

Sal?

Sal, it's okay.

Sal?

Sal!

All right.

Focus on the south end
of the park.

All right. Okay.
Call me back.

Thanks.

Another robbery?

Not this time.

The dog and the little girl
run away this morning.

I hope they've learnt their lesson.

Here.

No, thank you.

Mr. Trundle.

Hmm?

After 22 years of service,

tonight will be my last night
working at the Maverick.

Look, if you need a raise,
Marty, let's discuss that tomorrow.

Mr. Trundle, this is about
much more than a raise.

Have a good evening.

Right.

(door sticks)

JULIE THIEL:





here without you (music)




LAURA: No, it's been...
it's been all day.



here without you (music)


we all know? (music)





lose you now (music)


we all know (music)




(horse hoof beats approach)

It's just darkness.

It's just darkness.

(voice resounds)
Sal!

Sal?

It's... it's me.
It's me, Ray.

Sal!

They said we could keep him!

They said we could keep Ches.

Sal...

I'm wearing the shoes.

Real shoes.

(Ray cries)

Sal, you can't go without me!

You're my sister!

(horse whinnies)

(Sal gasps)

Hello?

Oh, no!

Ches, they found us!

Ches, you've gotta run.

Chestnut, run.

You gotta get out of here!

You... you want it?

Wanna play?

Go get it.
Go get it, boy.

Sal?

Sal Tomley, is that you?

Well, I'll be.

I know some people who will be
very happy to see you.

Now, let's get you home.

Don't forget the flashlight.

Got it.

Mnh.

Kosh, my boy,
this plan is foolproof.

Sal, you're back!

LAURA: Oh, sweetie.

Are you okay?

But where's Ches?

They said we could keep him!

I told him to go.

I thought they were gonna
take him away.

He's gone.

They'll find him, Sal.
They'll find him.

I have to go look, too.

It's really, really late.
It's gonna be okay.

You need to stay home
and rest, okay?

Come on, sweetie.

They'll find him.


Amen.

Will he come home, Sal?

KOSH: Slow down.

WES: Will you
pick your feet up?


I tell ya, Kosh, this could be
the biggest night of my career.

Whoa! And I get to be right here
with you, hey, Uncle Wes?

That's not very comforting, Kosh.

(low whimper)

(laughing)
KOSH: So good!

(cat yowls)
WES: Kosh, get out of there!

The camera's on a cycle.

KOSH: All right.
WES: Now!

(dog growls)
WES: Come on!

(growling continues)

All right, screwdriver.
Driver.

All right. Snips.

Snips.

Wrong way.

Red.

Okay, alarm's off.
All right, alarm's off.

WES: Pick.

KOSH: Right. Gotta unlock it.
WES: Stupid.

WES: Lock pick.
KOSH: Yeah.

KOSH: Okay.
WES: All right, we're in.

All right. This'll work.

I just get the code and...


Voila! Huh?
(elevator bell dings)

(snoring)
(elevator door opening)

WES: Come on, come on.
Get over here.

All right. Okay.

Will you just...!

(bell dings)

Den is that way.

Ohh!

Whoa!

Oh, yeah!


Hmm!

There's nothin' here, boss.

Check for secret compartments.

Right. Secret compartments.


Ah!

Ooh, jackpot, boss!


Oh!

(barks loudly)

Kosh, did you hear something?

No.

Go check it out.

What? Ya know, I think
it would be better

if you went
and checked it out, boss.

Kosh, I said check it out,
and I mean you!

Mmm! Fine!

Okay.

(low growling)

Uncle Wes, is that you?



It's that darn dog again.


KOSH: Oh, my head!

Yes, this is an emergency.

(coughing and sputtering)

(low growling)

This oughta take care of you!

Trundle!

That's it. I'm outta here.

No!!

Oh, hey, officer,
I was just... no, wait!

Are you okay, Mr. Trundle?

Yes, I am. I...



That dog just saved my life.


(sirens blaring)

(knocking on door)

Chestnut's been hurt.



He is the best vet
in New York City.

He's lost a lot of blood.

Oh, dear.

I have to see him.

Please wake up Ray.

She needs to say good-bye, too.

Ray.

Ray.

Come here, sweetie.

Are you okay?

Sal, is he gonna be okay?

Is he gonna see Mommy
in heaven?

Yeah.

Is she gonna take care of him?

Yeah.

She'll take very good care of him.

Just like she's took care of us.

Ches!

Ches!

Mom, Dad, he's okay!

He licked Sal.
He's gonna be okay!

(all talking at once)

I think I owe you all
an apology.


The press awaits you, sir.

Ah-choo!

Ah!

It is with the utmost of pleasure
that I'm here to announce

that New York City
has been saved from

the Central Park robbers
by a most unlikely hero...

Chestnut, the Great Dane.

(applause and cheering)

I only wish that he could
be here in person

for my very special announcement,

but he's upstairs recovering,

having saved my life this evening.

Now, I've had a very strict rule
in all my buildings for a very long time

but a lot changed for me tonight.

So I hereby declare
that from this minute forward,

dogs will be permitted
to live in this building

and any other Trundle buildings
in New York City.

REPORTER: Mr. Trundle,
what about the reward you offered?

On Chestnut's behalf,
Sally Ann and Ray Tomley

have, um, they decided
to donate the money

to the Lattimer Catholic
Orphanage for Girls.

Hey, kids!
Come on, kids!

Here ya go!

Whee!

Come here.

MATT: Ah-choo!

(bell tolling)

Ches!


I got a lickin'!

Now you gotta be happy.

(dog growling)


WOMAN: He's peein'.





(crashing sound)


Sal... (garbling words)

(garbling words)

Hay una rata enome
esta en apartamento!

Oy!!

I forgot my line!
(laughter)

It's you or the dog,
Mr. Whatever your name is.

Do it again!
(laughter)

Tomley.

Hello, Mr. And Mrs...
Tomley.

Toms... Tomskey.

MAN: And action.

He pooped!
(laughter)

(girls screaming)

Ow!

Hey, Chestnut. Be good.

(girls laughing)

You stay here.
You stay here!

(laughing)
Stay here, okay?


WOMAN: Watch his head!

Ow!

Ow! Let me out!


Ah-choo!


BOTH: (music) Down, down, baby,
down by the roller coaster (music)

never gonna let you go (music)
