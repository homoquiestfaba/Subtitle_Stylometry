<i>â™ª Summer's coming</i>
<i>Over my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I waited all</i>
<i>My life for this day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Summer's coming</i>
<i>Over my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's gonna be</i>
<i>A mighty time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby better</i>
<i>Get outta bed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause summer's</i>
<i>Coming over our head â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby better</i>
<i>Get outta bed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's gonna be</i>
<i>A mighty time â™ª</i>

Excuse me.

<i>We're trying to find</i>
<i>Vaselli's Cellars winery?</i>

Oh, yeah,
that's up
in Temecula.

You guys are
kinda far away.

<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Isn't he that guy?</i>

Oh, my gosh,
you're right.

Yeah, we saw you on <i>TMZ</i> .

<i>You were married</i>
<i>to that actress.</i>

Uh, technically
still married.

Oh, that sucks
what she did to you.

Um, the winery
is 30 miles up
that road right there

past the old bridge.

Hey, you wanna
come with us?

We could use
a tour guide!

Uh, yeah, I--


I've got a lot
of work to do.

Your loss.

Ah! Son of a--

<i>Yeah, nothing says summer</i>
<i>like a nice hot fire.</i>

Well, at least
you found somethin'
to keep yourself busy.

Ho, man!

We gotta do somethin'
to get you out
of this funk.

Have you met that new
chick in town, Caroline?
Not interested.

I'm not saying
you gotta marry her, Jake.
Just go have some fun.

I don't wanna be
set up, Pete.

My divorce isn't
even final, yet.

Come on,
it's one dinner.

How do you know
she'd even go out
with me?

<i>Because she already</i>
<i>said she would.</i>

I told her
I'd let her out
of her parking ticket.

Pete!

What?
That's what
family's for, man.

<i>Death, divorce.</i>
<i>Oh, and debt.</i>

<i>I told ya</i>
<i>I'd pay it back.</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What do you think
of this shirt, buddy?

<i>Well, you know what?</i>
<i>You're not a fashion</i>
<i>plate either, buddy.</i>

No, I look stupid.

You think
I should shave?

Fine, I'll shave.

<i>You're right.</i>

<i>â™ª Boy meets a girl </i>

â™ª Love is so loud

â™ª And he says to her

â™ª I've got a pocket
Full of love â™ª

<i>â™ª I've got a pocket</i>
<i>Full of love â™ª</i>

Uh, you could
at least take off
your wedding ring.

Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's a long story.

We're-we're separated.

Thank you.

I know.

Cheers.

The whole world
knows, Jake.

How does a guy like you
get a woman like that?

Wha-uh--

But she-she was going
to the wineries,

<i>and on her way</i>
<i>her car broke down,</i>
<i>and I fixed it.</i>

The next thing
you know, we're
in Vegas

getting married.


You don't have
the goods?

No, no.
No, it's not that.

She cheated on me.
That was--

Oh, right!
I heard that.

They were making fun
of you on Leno.

Yeah, that--

You're not
over her, are you?

I--

Thank you.

I'll take mine
to go, please.

You're leaving?

Listen, Jake,
it was nice
meeting you.

<i>But you're not</i>
<i>ready for this.</i>

Thanks for dinner.

Anytime.

â™ª Take your hand
Out of that glove â™ª

â™ª And reach into
My pocket of love â™ª

<i>[Brazilian music]</i>

She was a massage therapist
and a yoga instructor.

That is a sure thing.
What did you do wrong?
Nothing!

You talked about Amanda
all night, didn't you?

She asked me about her.
What am I supposed
to do, lie?

Yes. Yes, you're
supposed to lie.

Jesus!
How did you get married
in the first place?

Amanda said she liked me
because I was real.

That is so sweet.

What do you think?
What do I think?

I think you named it
after Amanda's favorite
flower.

Lots of people
like hyacinths.

People like tulips and roses.
Nobody even knows what
a hyacinth is.

Besides, that is
"inth" not "enth"
Rhodes scholar.

Oh, crap!

Let me get a beer.

You're still on duty.

Three to one.
I'm off.

<i>(man)</i>
<i>Ana!</i>

Hey, Victor.

Sorry.

[English accent]
So,

your father left you
a rather large
inheritance.

Inheritance?
How much?

About 500,000.
<i>Oh, my.</i>

I'm sorry, I think
you're getting
the wrong idea.

Uh, look.
Here.

Yeah?

Right?

Wow, 500,000 it's--
Wow, what is it?

Here.

<i>Minus signs.</i>

You mean like
negative signs?

Like <i>very</i> negative.
Your father left you
a rather large debt.

What-what do you
mean a debt?

This is not a debt.
This is-this is
not a debt.

This is negative sign,
negative sign,

negative sign,
negative sign,
this is not right.

This can't be right.
And by law,

the debt is now yours.

Victor.

You're kidding me, right?
Don't do that.

Don't do--
I never joke
about the law.

Or fashion.

<i>There is something.</i>
<i>This might help.</i>

It seems he owned
a piece of land
in California

in a town
called Webster.

Yeah, I--

I think I-I know
what this may be.

<i>It's my father's</i>
<i>mother, my grandma.</i>

She moved to the US
before I was born.

<i>It's California</i>
<i>real estate.</i>

Who knows?
It could be
worth millions!

Take the picture already.

Oh, my God.

Don't be so
self-conscious.
You look great.

He looks
like a goober.

Let me get a beer.

Thanks a lot.

Okay.

I don't understand why
I have to be in the picture
for the ad anyway.

You're asking people
to come to your house.

They need to see
they can trust
their host.

<i>When this ad comes out,</i>

your phone will be
ringing off the hook.

Assuming I can get
the phone to actually
work.

<i>Hey, Jake.</i>
<i>Shaping up?</i>

Thank you.
Still a fixer
upper though.

You're shaping up
nicely, too, Celeste.
You look great.

Thank you
for noticing.

I've some
registered mail for you.

That looks
pretty important.

Hope it's not bad news.

Thanks.

It's just, uh,
divorce papers.

<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>Yeah, no big deal.</i>

She can come here herself
if she wants me
to sign them.

Celeste?
Wow, what
happened to you?

You used to be huge!

Pete.

I'm just--
You look awesome!

It's all right.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

I lost 50 pounds
on my new diet.

Wow!

Hey!

What do you
think, Mr. Jake?

I think we're taking
another picture.

Why is that funny?
Why are you laughing?

I do look
like a goob.

<i>It turns out someone</i>
<i>lives in the house.</i>

His name is Sullivan.
That's all I could
find out.

I managed to wrangle
an e-mail address

from the county clerk
there in Webster.

<i>How-how can he live</i>
<i>in a house that's</i>
<i>not his?</i>

How can he do that?

I don't know, but
it does make things
more complicated.

<i>You can't sell it</i>
<i>if he's in there.</i>

<i>And if he won't move,</i>
<i>you'll have to evict him.</i>

If you like,
I could send
a letter.

<i>No, you know,</i>
<i>I can handle that.</i>

I think I can write him
an e-mail explaining
everything.

He'll understand, right?

<i>Hey, use a little help</i>
<i>here, handyman.</i>

One second
there, Sheriff.

Come here,
take a look at this.

So, you think
this is the real deal?

<i>No, that's one</i>
<i>of those scam things.</i>

And he's probably
a brushing hacker
in his mum's basement.

Best thing you can do
is just ignore it.

And voila!

Who says you're
the only brother
handy with tools?

The top shelf
is a little crooked.
Where?

That side is not--
Here?

Really?

Beer run.

Screw...yourself.

<i>(Ana)</i>
<i>Screw yourself?</i>

Screw me?

Screw you!

Ha! Have a nice day.

I'll tell you what.
I'll give 'em this.
They are persistent.

Hey, you know what?

I know what'd
shut them up.

Shoot in the moon,
like the old days.

<i>That would be</i>
<i>funny, but--</i>

You know what?
What the heck,
let's do it, Pete.

Here we go.
Say cheese.

Cheese!

Hi, Maria.

[talks in Spanish]

What?

<i>[Seabellies sing</i> 2571 <i>]</i>

<i>Victor, thank you so much</i>
<i>for helping me with Paulo.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>it was the best thing.</i>

At least in jail
he was safe.

You know, he's not
a teenager anymore.

Now you're gonna
have to sell
that place.

Mm, that would be
a challenge.

Here's his answer.

Mm.

Mm!
Not bad.

Can't we do anything?

Well, I am
a...fabulous
lawyer.

Mm.

All right,
very solid.

There's not much you
can do from Brazil though.

If you're gonna settle
this quickly, you'll have
to go to the States.

Victor, I'm broke.

You know,
with Paulo,
with a debt,

I can't do that.
I can't!

I'll tell you what.

We'll both go.

I'll spring for the tickets.
I've loads or airline miles.

Victor, you're so sweet,

but I can't
let you do that.

Don't worry.

When you sell
the property, you can
give me a percentage.

Twenty per cent.

Ten per cent.

One percent,
and I'm not
going any lower.

California, here we come.

<i>[woman's distant voice]</i>
<i>Oh, this is interesting.</i>

<i>(man)</i>
<i>Always have to stay</i>
<i>in somebody's bedroom.</i>

<i>Why can't we stay</i>
<i>at an impersonal hotel</i>
<i>for a change?</i>

The place isn't even
<i>finished,</i> yet.

It's not unfinished.
It's rustic.

Actually it is unfinished.

We don't open
for another week
and a half. I'm sorry.

I told you
we should've made
a reservation.

<i>Come on, sweetie,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

Your ad says that
you open April 1st.

Oh, no, um--

We tried to call.

Uh, I'm sorry,
the phones aren't
hooked up, yet.

We're really not ready
for guests, yet.

<i>This ad's a misprint.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I wish we could</i>
<i>accommodate you, but--</i>

Oh, but you have to.

We tried to get
a reservation everywhere.

Because of the wine festival,
it's impossible to get rooms.

Ah, if you don't mind,
um, a little bit of a mess,

<i>I suppose we could</i>
<i>give it a shot.</i>

We don't mind.

Okay. Maria!

<i>Maria.</i>
Yes, Mr. Jake?

Um, we have our
first guests here.

Do me a favor.
Go to the store.
Get some food,

<i>and soap and towels,</i>
<i>and anything else</i>
<i>you think of.</i>

Everything
I can think of.
Got it.

Just keep it
under $50.

Please.

<i>Um, okay, let me,</i>
<i>let me get your bags,</i>

and I'll show you
to your room.

I would be honored.
Here we go.
Thank you.

I appreciate it.

Okay, thank you.

Be careful.

I got this, sir.
No problem about that.

Oh, here's your bag.
Okay.

Here's your bag.

I'll take it.
Don't worry about that.

Uh, follow me up here.

You are really strong.
Thank you.

Just follow me.
He's very strong.

Here we go.

I love the wallpaper.
Thank you.

Ah! I feel
like a cowboy!

Victor, don't do that!
Drive like a sane person.

I don't wanna end up
in an American jail.
Come on!

Relax!
Enjoy yourself.

I can't enjoy
until we get this resolved,
until we sell this house.

<i>And I don't see</i>
<i>any hotels here.</i>

Where are we gonna stay?

Well, we'll take a look
at your place first,

<i>and then</i>
<i>we'll find somewhere.</i>

Okay.

Mm. The land
of the free.

And I feel <i>free</i> !



Hey.
Hey.

Help me clean up.
I've guests here.

I got a job.

Come on!
All right.

What are you doing?
I spent a lot of time
on that!

Well, that looks good.

Ah! It's summer, Jake.

<i>â™ª All these people</i>
<i>â™ª That I'm gonna be there </i>

<i>â™ª Be there be there</i>
<i>With my love â™ª</i>

Oh, hey, hey.
That ain't good.

<i>â™ª Even if the country there </i>

<i>â™ª While we're</i>
<i>Driving in circles â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm gonna be there</i>
<i>Be there be there â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With my love </i>

Webster, California.

Is it really California?

This is the real America.

You have to get out
of the cities to see
how people actually live.

Lives!
Who lives here?

It looks like
a ghost town.

Hey, watch where
you're driving!

Watch where
you're walking!

<i>[talks in Spanish]</i>

[curses in Spanish]

I'm sorry, ma'am.

[honking horn]
You, too.
I'm sorry.

<i>She called me "mariflor".</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

Whatever it is,
you deserved it.

Okay, okay.

Jesus! You have
to watch it!

Where were
you looking?

See, the ad,
it's a misprint.

Actually, we're not open
for another couple
of weeks.

Oh, so does.
You have bed, no?

Yes, we have beds
but we're really
rough around the edges.

We come from Japan.

Oh, that's great.

Sam and Tracy Okata.

Hi. We come
from Japan.

Mm, smell that
fresh clean air.


I love
this place all right.

Don't be silly.
It's supposed
to be lucky.

What is it
a bed and breakfast?

<i>Somewhere to stay.</i>

You think
it's a good idea?

It is your house,
isn't it?
Yeah.

It is our
honeymoon.

Oh, con--
Congratulations.

Okay, you know?
I'll tell you what.

Why don't you guys
take the first one

on the right side
as you get up the stairs?

Can I help you
with your luggage
or anything?

Sure?
Sayonara.

<i>Okay, sayonara.</i>

Hi.
Hey.

Um, are you here
for a room?

Well, this is a bed
and breakfast, isn't it?

Yeah, yes, sir.
Well, almost.

I guess officially
now, yeah.

I'm Victor.
Victor Garcia.

This is my beautiful
wife, Sonia.

<i>We live in Spain,</i>

and we are here
to savor the local wines.

<i>I'm Jake Sullivan.</i>
<i>This is my place.</i>

<i>And welcome.</i>
<i>Please, come on in.</i>

<i>Ah, so, you are</i>
<i>Jake Sullivan?</i>

Yes, I am. Yes.

Uh, may I ask what
is a hyacinth house?
What is it?

Uh, hyacinth.
A flower.

<i>So, how long will you</i>
<i>be staying with us?</i>

<i>Just one night.</i>
<i>Possibly two.</i>

Yeah, and we want
twin beds, please.

He snores.
Kills me.

Yeah.

You?
This man
is a <i>lunatic.</i>

You ought
to be in jail
the way you drive.

You two know
each other?

Yes, but we got off
on rather the wrong foot.

He means he almost
ran over my foot.

This is Maria.
Maria, this is Sonia
and Victor,

and they are guests
from Spain.

<i>[talking in Spanish]</i>

Yes. Always.

I didn't know
you were such
a <i>dynamic</i> woman.

Please.

I am not that
easily charmed.

<i>(Jake)</i>
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'm gonna get a key.</i>

Your room will be
the third door on
the right up the stairs.

That's the one
with twin beds.

<i>Luggage or anything?</i>

No, no,
we're okay.

Is there a real estate
lawyer in town?

Uh, yes,
Hank Simmon's office,
right in the middle of town.

Are you interested
in buying some property
here in Webster?

We're here
just checking
the value--

Sonia, darling.

It's time
for my siesta.

Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.

Certainly.
Thanks.

Oops!
Okay.

We're not
completely finished.

<i>[laughter]</i>

Maria?

Maria!

I think I'm going
to like it here.

I warned you
when you hired me.

I'm not much
of a cook.

Maria, till we get
this place up and running,

<i>we're all gonna have to do</i>
<i>a little bit of everything.</i>
<i>What is that smell?</i>

It's <i>menudo,</i>
the only breakfast
I know how to make.

As soon as I can,
I'll hire a chef.

So...what
did you think
of that couple?

<i>The woman's sexy,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

I didn't notice.
You noticed.

She's married, okay?
So let's not even
think about it.

The man, he seems
a little, um, what's
the saying?

Light in the loafers.
Seemed European to me.

That's another thing.
I don't think they're
from Spain.

I don't even think
he understands Spanish.

Maria, when this place
gets up and running,

<i>we're gonna have</i>
<i>a lot of guests</i>
<i>coming through here.</i>

I don't need you
passing judgment
on everyone.

But I like
to pass judgment.

Maria, no.

Ugh, that's bad.

<i>(Ana)</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>
<i>It's closed.</i>

What do we do?

Take in some local color.

Oh!

This!
This is the store
of my dreams.

Let's buy
some clothes.

You're joking, right?
No way I'm getting
in there.

Oh, I am.

Victor!

Victor, please--

Howdy, partner?


<i>[tinkling]</i>


Oh.

Oh, yes!

Phones will ring--

<i>[doorbell chimes]</i>

Howdy!


Ooh, where on earth
did you get those clothes?

Fabulous little shop
right here in Webster.

Now, maybe
you can help me.

Is there
a cowboy bar in town?

Yes, along
the highway.

But I don't know
if we have the kind
of cowboys

you're looking for.

What do you mean?
I mean, what other kind
of cowboys are there?

There's only one
channel on the TV.
Static.

And there's no
cold water in
the shower,

no hot water
in the sink.

There's a hole
in the floor where
the toilet should be!

Oh, I am so sorry.

I forgot to put
a toilet in your room.

I don't mind.
It reminds me
of Italy.

Mr. Sullivan, I don't know
what kind of operation you
think you're running--

I'm so sorry.
I apologize.

Why don't you guys
take the rest of the day,

<i>go tour the winery,</i>
<i>on me, of course.</i>

And when you return,
I promise everything
will be fixed.

That sounds wonderful.

<i>Listen, don't you think--</i>
<i>They probably</i>
<i>have bathrooms.</i>

<i>Yes, they have.</i>

I'm sorry.

Hello.
Hi.

Hey!
Hello, baby!

<i>Oh, he likes you.</i>

What's his name?

This is Kevin.

I've always wanted
to have a dog like this.

Oh, no, no, no.
He doesn't know he's a dog.
He thinks he's my brother.

Me and my brother
were never that close.

Oh. Well, hey,
would you like
something to drink?

Some water perhaps?
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Okay, um,
can I just
ask you something?

Sure.

How long have
you owned this place?

Ah, a couple
of years.

You, you bought it?

No, it was given to me.
It was left to me
by a friend

when she passed away.

Oh. It seems like
an unusually generous gift
for a friend, isn't it?

Yeah, well, I was
her handyman for
a number of years.

And, well, we got
very, very close.

You weren't, I mean--

No, no.
No, no, no, no.

I'm sorry I asked.
She was 80 years old.

Oh!
No, absolutely not.

I don't wanna be rude,
but how did it get in such
awful shape?

It-it was left
for a long time.

And obviously I'm still
fixing things up.

In fact, we aren't supposed
to be open right now,

but the ad had
the wrong date on it, so.

What ad?
The advertisement
in the magazine.

How did you guys
hear about it?

Oh. We were just
passing by here.

It's kinda out
of the way place
to just pass by.

Yeah.
I think we just
got the wrong turn.

Well, I'm glad you did.

Okay, great.
Thank you.

See you around.

<i>[muffled voices,</i>
<i>woman laughing]</i>


<i>[woman moaning]</i>

He must be
like Superman.

It drives me crazy.
I can't think like this.

Okay, I'm gonna tell them
to keep it down.

<i>No, no,</i>
<i>let's leave them alone.</i>
<i>They're newlyweds.</i>

Who are we
to interfere with love?

Oh.

Okay, I won't
say anything.
I'll be nice.

<i>[loud moaning]</i>

<i>[message tone]</i>

Jesus.

<i>[loud moaning]</i>


Victor!
Turn the lights off!

Ah!
Good morning, Maria!

Good morning!

Mr. Okata.
Mr. Okata, I have
a great idea.

Maybe you guys wanna
take your breakfast
in bed.

Oh!

Oh, yes.

If you need help
with anything else,

I'm very good
in the kitchen.

Yes, ma'am.

Come on, Mr. Harvey.

I'm not finished, yet.
Sure you are.

I don't wanna go.

Bye.
Bye.

Come on, I said.

Mr. Harvey is coming.
Mr. Harvey has to go.

Uh, more coffee, Sonia?

Yes, please.

Sure.

Thank you.

Did you have the chance
to see Hank yesterday?

No, the office
was closed.

<i>Ah, sounds like Hank.</i>

Hank tends to work
a 45-minute day.

Uh, if you guys are
really serious about taking
some property here in Webster,

I'd be more than happy
to show you around.

Yeah, it would be nice,
but you don't have
to do that.

It would be
no trouble at all.

We can always use
new faces around here.

Especially one
as beautiful as yours.

And, and I mean that
in the most friendly
possible way.

Oh, it's okay.

Mr. Sullivan,
okay, I think I should
tell you something.

<i>(Celeste)</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
Now that--

<i>Morning, Celeste.</i>
Hey. I have another
package for you.

<i>It's from Amanda.</i>

Jesus, this
horrible town.

Does anyone work here?
I don't know
what to say.

Oops.
Sorry.

Ma'am, does this Hank
ever work?

Only when I want to.

You're Hank.

Short for Harriet.
And that sucks, right?

Come on in.

Jake Sullivan's place.

He did a really  nice job
fixing it up, didn't he?

Of course
I helped him
set up his business.

So, what
do you think
it's worth?

Never bothered
to find out.

Jake loves that place.
I don't think he's ever
gonna sell it.

Is there somewhere
where I can check
the property records?

Deeds, ownership,
that kind of thing?

That stuff is mostly down
at the court house, couple
of towns over.

What are you
two up to?

Sure asking
a lot of questions.


We just fell in love
with the place,
that's all.

No harm
in asking, right?

Well, if you're looking
to buy some property,
I got some super deals.

It's a great time.
More and more wineries
are opening.

Another year, this place
is gonna be a bussling
little hot spot.

Possibly.

But for now
we need to get right down
to the court house.

Great. Another day
stuck in Webster.

I'll drop you off
on the way over.

I don't want you
to die of boredom while
I'm searching through records.

Thank you.

Victor, I can't stand
all this lying.

Did you say
anything to Jake?

No.

I mean,
I almost did.

I couldn't help it.
He's so nice.

You are not having
second thoughts, are you?

Of course not.
I need the money.

I have to get Paulo
out of trouble,
to pay the debts.

This is not even
an option, right?

<i>[Brazilian music]</i>

<i>Hello, Jake.</i>

Hey! Sonia,
how are you?

<i>Did you finally</i>
<i>get to see Hank?</i>

Yeah, yeah.
Lemonade?

I think
it's still cold.

Yeah. Thank you
very much.

Uh, I was thinking
of catching some sun.

Do you know
where is a good place?

Uh, any place
there's a chair.

The backyard
is really nice.

Okay. Good.

Good job.

Thank you.

[clears throat]

Wow.

<i>[soft Brazilian music]</i>

[clears throat]

<i>[couple moaning]</i>

<i>[woman moaning loudly]</i>

Mr. Jake!

Mr. Jake.

What's the matter?
I have something
to tell you!

What is it, Maria?

I did some snooping
in their room.

Maria, we are not
supposed to snoop
on our guests.

We're supposed
to respect their privacy.

I told you something
was wrong with them.

I found a plane ticket
from Brazil, not Spain.

So what?
It doesn't matter.

And they're not married.
They're not even sleeping
together.

I told you
he was <i>afeminado.</i>

Maria, it doesn't matter.

And her name
is not Sonia,
it's Ana.

And I found this.

Hey, that's my--

I'm afraid that
is your ass.

So, can we
arrest them?

I don't know, Jake.

I arrest kids
for smoking weed.

This whole international
mafia syndicate Web stuff

is not up
my strong suit.

<i>My guess is</i>
<i>we just sit still</i>
<i>till they make a move.</i>

Hello, everyone.

<i>I just need</i>
<i>some more cream here.</i>

<i>How's the coffee, Sonia?</i>
<i>It is Sonia, right?</i>

Yeah.

Why do you
say it like that?

<i>You tell me.</i>

Ana.

Oh. You were
snooping in my room.

If you think that you can
scam me out of my house,
you can forget about it.

That's right, sister.
We don't take too kindly
to cyber crime

<i>interweb stuff</i>
<i>around these parts.</i>

<i>Hold on, Pete.</i>
<i>I got this.</i>

That guy upstairs,
he's not even your
husband, is he?

Okay, no,
he's my lawyer.
Ha!

<i>He's my lawyer,</i>
<i>and I brought him</i>
<i>with me</i>

to help me take back
my property, right?

Your property?
<i>Yeah, my property.</i>

This land
was given to me
by my grandmother.

This land
was left to me
by Flo in her will.

<i>So, put the clues together</i>
<i>if your brain can handle it.</i>

Florence was
my grandmother.

Your-your grand--
Your grandmother?

<i>Yeah, right.</i>

Yeah, I inherited it,
and I have the deed
to prove it.

Anybody can create
a deed with a fake
printer.

Oh, fake!

<i>I have Flo's will,</i>
<i>here in this house.</i>
<i>Oh, really?</i>

You can show me,
but it won't work.
I have the deed!

I have her will!

I'll take the deed
and I'll show you
and it won't work.

Put your clothes on, sister.
We dress for breakfast
in this country.

What are you
looking for, Mr. Jake?
Flo's will.

Miss Hank took all
the important papers
to keep them safe.

Safe from what?

Safe from you.

Fine. I'll go
to her office then.

Not without me.
I want this resolved now.

Fine.
Right now.

<i>"To Jake Sullivan</i>
<i>I leave the house</i>
<i>at 33 Miracle Way.</i>

<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for being my friend through</i>
<i>most difficult times."</i>

May I see?

<i>This is hardly</i>
<i>a legal document.</i>

<i>It isn't even notarized.</i>

<i>Although I must say</i>
<i>the stationery is</i>
<i>rather lovely.</i>

Uh, this clearly
won't stand up
in a court of law.

What?

I don't know how
you do things
in Mexican court.

Brazil.

Tomato, tomato.

<i>Jake, this is perfect.</i>

He's got you there, Jake.

<i>Without an official will,</i>
<i>property goes to the nearest</i>
<i>relative.</i>

Me.
<i>What?</i>

Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

Well, it just seemed
something better left
alone at the time.

Who would think that
somebody was crawling out
of the woodwork?

<i>Okay, great.</i>
<i>Now we can sell the house</i>
<i>and get the hell out of here,</i>

if we can ever
make it presentable.
Okay, let's go.

This is ridiculous.

<i>I'm sorry, Jake.</i>

We'll fix it.

Hey, I could kill him.

Pete.

It's just an option.
Just saying.


Well, I think now
I can buy something
for...for my house.

Ah!

Hey.

I just wanna tell you
I did not come to America
to cause you trouble.

And...we need
to discuss how
to proceed.

You don't have
to be out just yet.

Why don't you rent
the house to me?

I'll pay you
what I can upfront,

and then as soon
as the business
gets up and running,

you'll make your
money back quickly.

I would if I could,

but...I need a full
amount and I need it now.

Flo may have been
your grandmother,

but she was my friend.

If she wanted you
to have the house,

she would have
left it to you,
you know.

In the whole time
that I knew her,

she never even mention
that she had a granddaughter.

She never talked
about any family
at all, ever.

Of course, because
I never got to meet her.

She-she married
an American.

She left Brazil
before I was even born.

Now, I know my will
is not official,

but I have no doubt
that Flo wanted <i>me</i>
to have this house.

I don't blame you
for feeling this way,

but...it still
doesn't change anything.

I you think
I'm just gonna
give up

and roll over,
you can forget
about it.

I'll fight you.

And you will lose.

<i>[telephone rings]</i>

<i>(Pete)</i>
<i>Jake.</i>

<i>Jake.</i>

Jake.
Jake!

Wake up.
We found something
in the law you're gonna love.

Because she hasn't lived
here in years and hasn't paid
any of the property taxes,

<i>you can have</i>
<i>this place over again.</i>

<i>You just have to go</i>
<i>and pay the taxes</i>
<i>yourself,</i>

<i>and you don't even</i>
<i>have to pay them all.</i>

<i>Just enough to get</i>
<i>your name on the books.</i>

Yeah, write a $20-check,
fill out a few forms,
maybe it's yours again!

Are you sure?
So says the statute
right here.

Let's go then!

Oh, right.

Let's go!
Yeah, okay, hey,
I'll drive.

Okay. This is great.
I knew you could
do it, Pete.

That's perfect.
Thank you so much.
You got this whole situation--

Jake, how many
did you have?
I had two.

That's what they tell
every cop.

Two and a half.

<i>Wait until I get</i>
<i>in the car!</i>

Jake, I swear to God,
you puke in the car,
I will shoot you.

<i>[Brazilian music]</i>

<i>[knocking on door]</i>

Hope you kept
the receipts
for that job.

Why?
What are you
talking about?

You're not
getting the house.

I don't get it.
You didn't pay
taxes on it.

I did!
Squatter's rights, baby!

No!

This is not right, okay?
And I'll take it to court.

Fine, take it to court.
It'll take months,
years even,

<i>and I will fight you</i>
<i>every step of the way.</i>

Jake, the house is mine.
You know it already.
<i>It's not your house.</i>

<i>I pay taxes.</i>
<i>The house is mine.</i>

The house is mine.

<i>Shut up!</i>

<i>There is a way</i>
<i>to sort this out.</i>
<i>Mediation.</i>

<i>You present your cases</i>
<i>to a retired judge and</i>
<i>he makes a decision.</i>

<i>I've even</i>
<i>found one for you.</i>


Yeah, there's no way
I'm gonna trust anybody
you found.

Actually, I'm the one
who found him.

<i>My former employer,</i>
<i>Judge Connor.</i>

Well, if it brings
an end to all this,
then fine.

Okay.
Fine with me.

Fine.
Fine.

That's fine.
Good.


We make
a good team.

I suppose we do.

What do you say
you and I, we have
a night on the town?

I don't think
I would want to go
where you want to go.

Oh, all right.
I guess it was a bit
presumptuous of me.

I mean, why would you want
to go on a date with me?

You were
asking me out
on a date?

But I thought you
were for the men.

Oh, my God.

Is that what
<i>miraflor</i> means?

Maria, I'm not gay!

But the way you talk
and the way you dress
and your makeup.

Why does everyone
think I'm gay?

I'm just...English.


Hey, phone works!

Phone works.

Hyacinth House,
bed and--

<i>It's me.</i>
Amanda?

Yeah, it has been
a long time.

How do you think
I've been?

You may be used to having
the whole world know your
business, but I'm not.

You know
I said I would sign
those papers, no problem,

but you need
to bring them down
to me yourself.

At least give me that
little bit of dignity.

This really
is not a good time.

Let me try
to call you back
later tonight.

Ooh.

Are you okay?

Yeah, what
do you care?
Let's go.

Is it far?

It's a few
hours at least.

<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>
<i>I need a minute.</i>

Just one minute.

I'll be back!

Take your time.

There's my boy.
There's my boy!

You're so good.
You're so good!

You look comfortable.

<i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

There's nothing
to do here, right?

Nothing at all.

What is your problem
with Webster?

'Cause it's boring.

It's a dump.
Everything's so run down.
Shall I go on?

Okay, I'll give it to you.
Downtown Webster is
not much to look at,

but once we get out
into wine country,
it is...it's amazing.

You'll love it.

All the vines
are starting
to grow right now,

and it's like
the whole valley
is coming alive.

Of course the summer's,
summer's the best time.

It's tourist season,
and...I can't even
explain to you

the energy
of the place.

And then the fall
comes along,

and all the vines
turn into the most
amazing colors of red,

yellow.

<i>I wish you were more</i>
<i>of a bastard.</i>

<i>Yeah, it would be</i>
<i>a lot easier for me</i>

if I...if I hated you.

Likewise.

It'd be much easier
for me if you were
more of a bastard.

<i>[Seabellies singing</i>
Feel it Leave <i>]</i>

[no audible dialog]

Howdy, folks.
How you doing today?

Good.
Uh, real good.

<i>(Ana)</i>
<i>Are you the judge?</i>

Thirty years
on the bench.

<i>Don't tell me.</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

Lover's quarrel, right?

Hardly.

It's a property
dispute, Your Honor.

Same thing.

Come on,
let's go inside and...

see if we can get
this business
sorted out.

Okay.


<i>Well, let's start</i>
<i>with couple's dialog.</i>

We're not a couple.

Sure.
Tell you what.

I want you
to drink some tea.

Drink up.

<i>Ana, you want the house.</i>

How do you
communicate that
to Jake?

The house is mine.
Get out!

Ouch.
<i>Exactly.</i>

Well, how does that
make you feel, Jake?

Like crap.
The house is mine.
You get out.

Ouch! Ouch!

<i>Okay, Ana,</i>

I want you
to say this to Jake.

Jake, the house
you're living in

<i>was left to me</i>
<i>by my grandmother.</i>

<i>I'm so sad</i>

that I never
got a chance
to meet her.

<i>But she is</i>
<i>my family.</i>

And a week ago,

my father died
of a heart attack.

<i>And I miss him</i>
<i>so much</i>

<i>that the grief</i>
<i>hasn't even hit me, yet.</i>

<i>And the only thing</i>
<i>he left me</i>

is an incredible
amount of debt.

<i>The Bed and Breakfast</i>

<i>is my only hope</i>

<i>to free myself.</i>

I don't know
what to do.

<i>What would you do?</i>

What would you do?

I'm sorry.

<i>Namaste.</i>

That'll be $700.

[turns radio on]

[turns radio off]
I'd rather wallow
in silence,

if you don't mind.


What are you
gonna do next?

I've no idea.

The Bed and Breakfast
was my fallback plan, so.

Yeah.

Maybe whoever
I sell it to,

will let you
run the business.

We both know
that's not very likely.

I'm sorry, Jake.

I'm sorry. I--

<i>Please, stop saying</i>
<i>you're sorry.</i>

It just makes me
feel worse.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.


Ah!
Okay.

I'm sorry
about your family.

Yeah.


Hell.
What?

The-the--
Come on.

Come on!

Come on, come on.

What happened?

The car died.

Hello!

Hm!

Hello!

Anyone here?

God, it's so hot!

Hello!

I'm sorry.

We weren't expecting.

Well, you will be expecting,
if you keep that up.

Hello.

Hello.
Hi.

<i>Please, sign in.</i>

Thank you.

All the decent
places are full
with a waiting list.

You know, with the wine
festival in town.

So.

Is this place
even finished?

Oh, the grand opening
is in a week.

Mm-hm.
Hopefully.

How long will you
be staying?

Two nights.

And I want to reserve
dinner for tomorrow night
as well.

Okay, let me
find your key.


If there were anywhere to go,
I would tell you guys
to get a room.

Speaking of which,
where is my room?

Oh, upstairs to the right,
to the left, to the right.

Left, right, left.
Thanks.


Maybe we should go
somewhere private.

And dark.


<i>Don't even try</i>
<i>to get a cell phone</i>
<i>signal out here.</i>

No? No way?
Uh-uh.

We can walk.
How far are we
from town?

Oh, we're just
like 40 miles
either direction.

<i>And if we're gonna walk,</i>
<i>we're gonna walk</i>
<i>in the morning</i>

because this is
mountain lion country.

Wow.

So, this is what you call
emergency supplies, right?

Sorry, Your Highness.
If I knew I was gonna
have company,

I would've had caviar
and champagne.

Cheers.

Mm.

Can I make
a personal question?

Sure, you can make
a personal question.

Who were you
fighting with

before on the phone?

That's my soon
to be ex-wife.

What happened
between you?

A long story.

I think we have time.

She's an actress.

Oh.

Not Julia Roberts
or anything like that.

She's well known
in television.

I moved down to L.A.
with her in a big house
in the Hollywood Hills.

It sounds exciting.

More like humiliating.

Everything
was about her
and her fame.

Yeah.

So, she gets this role
in a movie, finally,

and she hooks up
with her co-star.

No!

And didn't even have
the guts to tell me
about herself.

Her assistant
has to tell me.

Then I got to see
all the pictures
in the tabloids.

It was awesome.

Wow.
That's why
you're angry.

You should.
I would be angry, too.

I'm not angry.
I'm just embarrassed.

It's not--

That wasn't me.
I didn't belong there.

What about you?

Do you...have
a boyfriend
or a husband?

I have a fiancÃ©.

Yeah.

Or maybe he's just
a boyfriend.

Or-or maybe
he's nothing.

I-I don't know where
we stand anymore,
you know.

He's like a child.

He only thinks
of himself.

It's pretty much
like your, your--

Yeah, we should get
the two of them together.


Sorry.
Oh!

[both laugh]
I'm sorry.

It happens.
That's embarrassing.

I'm so sorry.

Happens
to the best of us.
Look at you!

Beer, beef jerkey.
We'll make an American
girl out of you yet.

Yeah.
Yeah!

Yeah, man!


Very good.

Ugh. There you two are.

You got everybody
worried sick.

Yes, sweetheart,
you're dressed.

And you,
[clicks tongue]

you're losing touch.

It's--

<i>â™ª Don't be afraid </i>

<i>â™ª Love on it's way </i>

<i>â™ª It's true</i>
<i>It's true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you believe it </i>

<i>â™ª Dreams can come true </i>

<i>â™ª It might happen</i>
<i>Even to you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As long as you </i>

<i>â™ª Keep on believing </i>

<i>â™ª I believe it </i>

<i>â™ª I believe it </i>

<i>â™ª I believe it </i>

[no audible dialog]

How did it go?

The judge said
the house is mine.

<i>Ay,</i> Jake!

That's good.

I just don't feel much
like celebrating.

Maria?

<i>Do we have</i>
<i>another guest?</i>

<i>Si.</i> Mr. Pierre.
I put him in
the room three.

Okay, where is he?
Now, where is he
right now?

He got up
early this morning
and went to the vineyard.

Is this a problem?
Yes, this is
a problem.

Pierre Hopewell is like
the biggest reviewer
in all of California.

If he doesn't like the place,
they might as well close their
doors down right now.

I can't believe
he saw the place
like <i>this.</i>

There's another thing.
He made a reservation
for dinner.

Where?
<i>Aqui.</i>

Hey!
Hey.

What are you doing?
Making dinner.

<i>There's a very important</i>
<i>reviewer staying here</i>
<i>tonight,</i>

that's why I make sure
that he's impressed.

Jake, what does it matter
if you get a good review?

You are planning to honor
our agreement, aren't you?

Yes, absolutely,
of course.
It's just--

I put a lot of work
into getting this place
ready, so.

I'd like to know
if it would've been
successful.

If it would've lasted.

You-you can't
serve him this.
It's horrible.

Well--
Come with me.

Where are we going?

Let me take
charge, okay?
Okay.

Oh, God, what is
this thing made of?
Stone?

<i>â™ª I'm watching the birds</i>
<i>Passing on by â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It makes me wanna cry </i>

<i>â™ª It makes me wanna cry </i>

<i>â™ª Lalala lalala </i>

Is it beer time, yet?

<i>â™ª Lalala lalala</i>
<i>Lalala lalala â™ª</i>

Oh, hey.

Feet.

<i>â™ª Lalalalala </i>

What are you doing?
Are you cleaning
for them, too?

<i>â™ª Will surely end </i>

Oh, it smells so good.
I never smelled anything
like that before.

<i>â™ª One day this trip</i>
<i>Will surely end â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And there's no need</i>
<i>To start again â™ª</i>

Get off.

<i>â™ª Leave it all behind </i>

I hide it
behind the basket
so it doesn't break.

<i>â™ª Leave it all behind </i>

It's okay?

For now.
For now.

<i>â™ª Leave it all behind </i>

<i>The wineries all</i>
<i>closed like an hour ago.</i>
<i>He could be here anytime.</i>

Okay, I need
15 more minutes.

<i>[bell dings]</i>

We don't have
15 more minutes.

Okay, okay, go.
Go, go, go go.

You look beautiful.

<i>[bell dinging]</i>

Hi.

Is this
the same place
I left this morning?

Sure it is, yes, sir.
We're still fixing it
up a bit,

but people really wanna
stay here, so we opened
our doors a little bit early.

Jake Sullivan.
Very nice to meet you, sir.

We'll see.

Well, you got here
right on time.

Dinner is ready
when you are.

I was born ready.
Lead the way.

Yes, sir.

Um, everyone,
please say hello
to our newest guest.

Pierre.
Pierre, everyone.

Hello, Pierre.

Hello.

Are all your meals
this big a production?

<i>Well, we want every night</i>
<i>to be one to remember.</i>

Okay, wine anyone?

Right here, sir.
Guest of honor.

<i>(Victor)</i>
<i>Amazing food</i>
<i>and perfect wine.</i>

<i>(Mrs. Okata)</i>
<i>This food is fantastic!</i>

<i>[mixed voices]</i>

<i>[Brazilian music]</i>

<i>(Victor)</i>
<i>Fabulous.</i>

This Vaselli salad
is excellent.

<i>[Brazilian music]</i>

[no audible dialog]

I propose a toast.
To love, life, liberty,
and lots of wine.

[toasting in Portuguese]

[Brazilian music]

I gotta tell you,
that was the best dinner
I think we've had in years.

We're gonna
take a walk.

Don't wait up.

No, we won't.

They are so
very cute.
Yeah.

I think she might--
She likes you
a lot.

Too much wine.

But here we go.


I've gotta turn in.
I've to be in Saratoga
first thing in the morning.

Mr. Hopewell,
I have to ask you,

what do you think?

So, you know
who I am.

Yeah.
I guess there's
no hiding anymore.

What do I think?

Well...I think
you two have
put together

the perfect blend
of both the exotic
and the familiar.

The exotic being
the most risky.
RisquÃ©.

Familiar being
the most comfortable.

Keep it up,
you're bound
to go far.

Salud.
<i>Salud.</i>

And to think
if there had been
a room anywhere else,

I might have missed
the best meal
of my life.

I guess this is
what you call
serendipity.

I love that word.

Goodnight you guys.

Goodnight.
Goodnight.

Did you hear that?

Yeah.

<i>[glass clinking]</i>


That word,
"serenidip",
"serenidipi",

<i>what is?</i>

Serendipity.
It means when
something pleasant

happens unexpectedly.

A happy accident.

Serendipity.
Serendipity.

Jake?

Amanda?

It's me!
Wha--

Wow.
That's all I get?

I'm just very
surprised to see you.

You didn't call me
back last night.

So I thought,
what the hell,
I'll come and see you.

Amanda, this is Ana.

Hi.

Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.

Are you
the new maid?

I think
I should go.

Bye.

Goodnight.

Ana...Ana is Flo's
granddaughter.

Who's Flo?

Flo, the woman
who left me
this house.

I've told you
a hundred times.

Oh, right, right.
I remember now.

Oh, maybe.
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

Wow!

I'm just shocked.

<i>Nick. Nick.</i>

His name's Kevin.

Come on,
mammy and daddy time.

Let's go!

Sorry, bud.

Tickle my feet.
Amanda.

Tickle my feet.

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Tickle, tickle.</i>

Amanda.
<i>Tickle my feet.</i>

I am very,
very confused here.

Why?
You asked me to come.

To sign the divorce papers.
That's what I asked you
to come here for.

Oh, those.

I tore them up.

I had some time
to think and,


I want
a second chance.

Hello, Kevin.

I feel
the same way.

Amanda, honey, wait.

Wait.
Would you just
hold one second?

Come here.
Come back to L.A. with me.
Sell this old place.

It's not even mine
to sell anymore.

I thought
you owned it.

Ana owns it now.

Flo, her grandmother,
left it to her.

It's a long story,
but now she is trying
to sell it, so--

I have a better idea.

Shh.

I'll buy the place.
I'll buy it,

and you can come back
and visit whenever
you want.

Do whatever it is
you need to do.
Visit?

I wanna live
here in Webster.

I'm not living
in Webster.

Forget about Webster.
We'll live in the penthouse
in New York,

or the beach house
in Venice.

What's wrong
with Webster?

I-I grew up here.
I was born and raised.
I like it here.

Listen, Jake, I got
a lot of bad press
after our breakup.

My manager says
he's gonna have a hard
time finding me work

if we don't get
back together.

I love you, sweetie.

I love you.

Amanda, you should go.

[muffled voice]
I love you.

I will go.

I--

Tell your lawyers
I'll sign the papers
tomorrow.

Don't think you're
getting any of my money.
We signed a pre-nup, remember?

Amanda, I don't want
anything of yours.

Good luck
with your career.

When you change
your mind, call
my assistant.


<i>[guests mixed voices]</i>

Hi.
<i>Hi.</i>

Are you kids
taking off?

Hi. <i>Arigato.</i>

[talks in Japanese]

Thanks for everything.

This is best time
we ever had.

<i>It was wonderful.</i>
<i>We really enjoyed</i>
<i>having you.</i>

Where are you guys
headed next?

We go to Chico
one week.

Chico?
Chico, California?

<i>There is nothing to do</i>
<i>in Chico, California.</i>

Perfect.

Oh. Ha!

Sayonara.

Travel safely.

<i>[door closes]</i>


Ana?

Maria, wh--

Where's Ana?
She left.

What do you mean she left?
She's not supposed to leave
until tomorrow.

She said
she had to be at home.
Her flight leaves in an hour.

Victor's going to be
staying with me until
the house sells.

Hopefully a little longer.

That's nice.

<i>â™ª Here comes</i>

<i>â™ª The one you know </i>

<i>â™ª Take me</i>
<i>To a better place â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where I can grow </i>

Come on!
Not now!

<i>â™ª Teach me how to lose </i>

<i>â™ª All I know </i>

No, no, no!
Damn!

<i>â™ª That's all I know </i>

Stupid!

<i>â™ª Winter just begun </i>

<i>â™ª It rains on everyone </i>

<i>â™ª But it doesn't</i>
<i>Rain on you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's only</i>
<i>Passing through â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And time</i>
<i>It goes so slow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It only goes to show </i>

<i>â™ª How easy it could be </i>

<i>â™ª To set you free </i>

<i>â™ª So take me</i>
<i>To a better place â™ª</i>

I thought
you were gone.

I realized
I forgot something.

Yeah, yeah,
your phone.

No.

Not that.

I, uh, I'm gonna go
get some beers.
How about that?

One for me, Pete.

See? Now we're talking.

Kevin, let's
get some beers.
Come on.

I wanna stay.

I wanna see
the tourist season,

and the vines
come red and yellow,

and the valley
become alive again.

You can do that.

It's your house.

It's our house.
Our Bed and Breakfast.

<i>We can be partners, no?</i>

That works for me.

If you told me
a week ago that I would be
here in Webster, California,

and...I wanted
to stay forever,

I would say
you were crazy.

<i>Now...this</i>
<i>whole trip</i>

<i>is "serenpidity", right?</i>


Serendipity.

Serendipity.

That was good.

Now I'll show you
the Brazilian way.

Oh, yeah?

So, so that's
what we call it.


Okay.


I like it a lot.

<i>Do you?</i>
Yes.

No one knows
what this hyacinth is.

Hyacinth, it is a flower.

The worst name ever.

Big problem.
We are out
of beer.

<i>â™ª Sun's coming up</i>
<i>In the sky â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm watching</i>
<i>The birds passing on by â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It makes me wanna cry </i>


<i>â™ª We've been</i>
<i>Waiting for so long â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For the sunshine</i>
<i>For the sunshine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We've been</i>
<i>Waiting for so long â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For the sunshine</i>
<i>To get back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tell me where </i>

<i>â™ª Is the sunshine </i>
