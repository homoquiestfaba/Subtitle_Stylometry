<i>Four days ago,</i>

<i>On the outside,
my life seemed perfect.</i>

<i>Perfect boyfriend, perfect job,</i>

<i>Perfect peace.</i>

<i>But something
was always missing.</i>

<i>That's why I needed to find you.</i>

<i>To find me.</i>

"Ahimsa,"

Which means non-Violence,

Is the foundation
of our practice.

<i>We have the ability,</i>

<i>Every day,</i>

<i>To choose peace.</i>

<i>Within every posture,</i>

<i>Every breath,</i>

And every moment of our lives.

That is a nice car.

What is that?
'65? '66?

'65.

They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

I know it's expensive,
but I really think

<i>It's worth advertising
in the yoga journal.</i>

Okay.<i>
We could mention that we're donating to that orphanage.</i>

Yeah.

Do you have any pictures
of you with the kids there?

Yeah, I think I do.
That's great.

And I'm still waiting on
your bio.

I know, I'm working on it.

Just keep it simple...
You're an inspiring woman.

I guess.
You inspire me.

<i>Hey, honey, did you take</i>

<i>Your old car out today?</i>

Yeah, why?<i>
Well, you said you were</i> gonna take your bike.

I just... Just ran
a couple of errands.

<i>Yeah, well I wish you would
have told me,</i>

I would have come back early.

You know, I, um...
I heard from Kathy today.

The... You know
the private investigator?

<i>And?</i>

And, she has an address
for Susan,

And it's 30 minutes away.

Wow.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

I think I really
want to meet her.

<i>I think that's great.</i>

I think that's gonna be
really good for you.

Yeah, I think I'm gonna
take a few hours tomorrow,

And just drive down there...
Tomorrow?

<i>Yeah.</i>

Well, we just...
We've got so much to do.

<i>This is gonna be very
emotional for you.</i>

Yeah. Yeah,
you're probably right.

I should just do it
some other time.

Yeah?

Hi.

Are you Susan Adams?

Yeah.

I'm may miller.

So, what do you want?

This is gonna sound strange,

But I think you're my sister,

From my biological mother,

Her name was Jennifer Adams.
Are you...

<i>Who is it?
Nobody, baby.</i>

Yeah, there's a bar
around the corner,

I'll meet you there
in five minutes.

Want a drink?

Yeah, I'll get it.

Um, what would you like?

I'll have a vodka cranberry.

It doesn't need to be
fancy vodka,

House is fine.

Okay.

Um, i...

I brought you these.
They are these a... Amazing raw cookies,

With, uh...
Macadamia, chia seeds.

Thanks.

You might want to take
a look at that.

I'll get our drinks.

You are Susan, right?

Yeah, but call me Shiva,
even mom did.

Okay.

Um, so...
So, what...

Sorry, uh, you...

You, uh... Go first.
No, you go.

This is fuckin' crazy.

Yeah.

I guess she never
told you about me.

No, never.

Thanks.

Sorry.
Thanks.

Yep.

You look just like her.

It's something about your, um...

Well, I wouldn't know

'Cause I've...
I've never seen her.

Here.

How old were you when she died?

12.

God, that must have been hard.

Yeah.
Did you live with your dad after that?

Foster homes.

Didn't you have
any other family?

Yeah, my mom's parents,
but they didn't want me.

What year were you born?

'81.

Fuck, she was like 17
when she had you.

Do you think it's...

Do you think it's possible

That we have the same dad?

I doubt it.

I mean,
I never met my dad, so...

But, I don't know,
like ten years apart?

It doesn't seem likely.
Hmm.

So, what do you do?
What do you mean?

You know, for a living.

Oh, uh...

I try to make people happy.

I guess I kind of do that too.

How?
I teach yoga.

Huh.

<i>What about you?</i>

Uh, massage.

Oh.

Here, give me your hand.

Oh, look at that.

What?
Your lifeline.

It like totally stops
and then it starts again.

It's like you have two lives.

<i>Okay, you hurt yourself</i>

Doing yoga.

Isn't it supposed
to be, like, healing and shit?

Well, yeah, I mean, that's...

That's absolutely the intention,

But you know,
you can't control the outcome.

Sometimes,

You... You need
an injury to grow.

You need it to,

You know, evolve.

That's fucked up.

Well, this is me.

What?

Holy shit, this is your ride?

Yeah, you like it?

Holy shit, yeah.

My boyfriend wants me to sell it

For a smart car, or something.

Oh my god, fuck that.

Over my dead body
you can sell this

For a fucking smart car.

Oh my god, I would kill
for a car like this.

Well, you want to buy it?

Oh, yeah...
Just let me get the bag of cash

That's waiting
in my living room.

Oh, now, I'll give
you the family discount.

Um, here, uh,

Take it,
I got... I got others.

Thanks.

Um, I gotta go.

Okay, so, um, can...
Can we see each other again?

Yeah, yeah, um...

yeah,
I'll call "yoga with may."

Yeah, we will, uh,
we'll do some yoga.

Yeah, so my knee
can get fucked up, too.

<i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

Hey.
<i>- Hey. Where you been?</i>

Oh, you picked up the postcards.

<i>Yeah, they look great.</i>

Yeah, I've been trying
to call you all morning.

So, where were you?
Hmm?

Oh, um...

I was just out.

<i>Who is it?</i>

I met her.
<i>- Who?</i>

I met Susan.

<i>So, how was it?</i>

It was great.

It was really great.

I mean, she's
so different from me.

She's so different.

But there was just this,
I don't know, this...

This deep connection
that I didn't expect.

<i>That's beautiful.</i>

I'd love to meet her.

Well, her boyfriend
wants to meet me, too,

And they are going out tonight,

And they invited us to come.

<i>Well, not tonight.</i>

<i>We have plans, remember?</i>

All the bullshit I do for you?

Like what?

<i>Like all I've fucking done.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>
Hey.

So, uh...
So this is may, right?

Oh this is my...
My boyfriend, Cody.

Well, it's nice to meet you.

Yeah, likewise.

You know I can, uh...
I can see the family resemblance.

Must be like looking
in a mirror with you two.

Hey, wait, let me, uh...
Let me buy you a drink.

What do you want?
Oh, um, well I'm...

I'm driving tonight, so just a water.
Oh, bullshit, come on,

You can have one drink, right?

No, I'm... I've got a really
early start in the morning, so...

A glass of wine, maybe?

You look like
the chardonnay type.

<i>You are the chardonnay type.</i>

Well, sometimes,
but not... Not tonight.

<i>No?</i>
Thank you.

Baby, can you just
get her a water, please?

Okay.

All right, so one water,

One vodka and cranberry
for the princess.

I'll see you inside.

Hey, can we go?
Is everything okay?

<i>I can't deal with him
tonight, let's go.</i>

Sure.
- Okay.

Do you want to tell him?

Do you want a lime in it?

Hey. Hey.
- Just trust me.

Where the fuck are you going?

I'm buying you a fucking drink,

Fuck off.
- What the fuck is that bullshit?

Hey, come on,
Get off!

I'm buying you fucking drinks.

Hey, hey, hey...
Don't fucking hit me.

Leave her alone, man.

I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

<i>Hey, be cool, man.</i>

<i>If the lady wants
to leave, just...</i>

<i>Cody, cut it out!
I said, who the fuck are you?</i>

Look, I got no... Hey!
Who the fuck are you?

<i>You don't have any problems?</i>

<i>I've got problems.</i>

Can you get me out of here?
- <i>I got no problem...</i>

Please?
- <i>That's funny,</i>

<i>'Cause I've got a big
fucking problem.</i>

<i>Leave us alone!</i>

Oh, that's cute, fuck.

Fucking weakling.

We have to call the police.

<i>Please, may, let's just go.</i>

<i>Stop it!</i>

Shit, huh?

What the fuck you gonna do?

Jesus.
- <i>Shiva,</i> where are you going?

I think it's fate
that we met right now,

Don't you?

I also think that you are a powerful,
beautiful woman

Who doesn't even realize it.

Thanks.

<i>Good-Night.</i>
Good-Night.

<i>Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu.</i>

What are you doing?

I'm just saying
a prayer for peace.

You're such a hippie.

Sorry.

No, it's...
It's okay.

It's nice.

May.

May.

Hey.

<i>I did not feel comfortable
letting her go back</i>

To her own place.

Okay.
I've gotta go, I've got a private.

Okay -
You've got class in less than an hour.

<i>So you should start moving.</i>

No, I think I'm gonna
cancel today.

Cancel? What?

Look, I'm happy
that you found your sister...

<i>Hi.
Hi, I'm sorry,</i>

I just needed to use
the bathroom.

Oh, yeah, it's just...
Um, there, on the left.

And this is my boyfriend.

Hi, Shiva. Dex.
Very nice to meet you.

<i>Yeah, you too.</i>

<i>She seems sweet.</i>

Okay. We can talk about this later.
Okay.

All right
Mm-Hmm. Bye.

Love you.
Love you.

Bye, Shiva.

Hey.

He seems, like, super nice.

Yeah.

<i>You know, I was thinking,</i>

Would you want to just
go away for a night?

Just you and me?

Like a lady date?

Exactly.

Go where?

Well, my mom
has this little place

Up near Santa Barbara,
we could just chill, and...

She's probably gonna be there,

But there is a pool.

<i>Oh, fuck. I wish.</i>

<i>Why not?</i>
Cody would fucking freak.

Well, Dex will freak too.

So?

I've gotta work this weekend.

I've gotta get my rent together.

Here.

Pay me back whenever.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

Thanks.

His truck's gone,
so he's definitely not home.

Do you want me
to go in with you?

Okay.

Or you could
just borrow something,

Because I have plenty
of stuff there, like I said.

No, I'm... I'm good.

What is that look?
- What look?

That look you just gave me.

<i>I didn't give you a look.</i>

Yes, you did.

<i>I to...</i>

<i>Okay, you look gorgeous
in that dress,</i>

<i>I'm just like...
I couldn't pull it off the way you do.</i>

<i>Hey, I like your disco ball.</i>

Oh yeah?
Mmm-Hmm.

Cool.
Um, yeah I got it at the flea market.

<i>Do you want something to drink?</i>

Like some water?
I think we have...

I think we have beer.

Nope, I'm fine.

Okay.

So, how long have you
lived here?

Like, three years.

Is... Is that a gun?

Yeah.

Is it yours?

It's Cody's.

You know what guys are like.

Jesus, don't point
that over here.

Well, it won't bite
unless you make it.

Woof!

That is not funny.

It's a little funny.

You totally wanna hold it.

Take it,
come on. Take it.

Come on.

Wow. It's heavy.

Yeah,
it's a .45.

It's Cody's
dad's gun from Vietnam.

Is it loaded?

Always.

Here.

I mean, come on,
doesn't that make you a little scared?

You have a loaded gun
in your house.

No. It makes us safe,
right?

Like if the bad guys come?

Yeah, but if the bad guys come,

It's more likely
to be used on you.

No, those bad guys
never met Cody.

<i>What was our mother like?</i>

<i>She was just so much fun.</i>

<i>Was she cool?
Was she wild?</i>

<i>You know,
she had such a big heart.</i>

<i>She was...
I loved her.</i>

<i>You would have loved each other.</i>

<i>Fuck, nice place.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

Hey, can I ask you something?

Yeah, sure.

And it's...
If it's none of my business,

I mean...

you don't have to answer.

Okay.

What kind of massage do you do?

Is this what you've been thinking
about for the past half hour?

No.

I was just kind of
curious, if...

Are you trying to ask me
if I'm a hooker?

No.
I prefer sex worker.

Sure, yeah.

Not that it really matters.

No, I get it.

I get it.

Do you have anything else
you want to ask me?

Nope.
Okay.

Well, actually, um,

Are you okay
with what you're doing?

I mean, it's not perfect, but,

What the fuck is?

I don't need to be saved.

Mom?

Mom?
- <i>I'm in my room.</i>

Okay, um...

why don't you just
hang out by the pool,

Or get a drink, or something?

Okay.
Make yourself at home.

<i>Hey, mom,</i>

Hey, honey.

Whew, it's really chilly
in here.

Oh, it's so hot
outside I can't stand it.

This much A.C.
Is gonna kill you.

I didn't expect to see you
this weekend.

Well, I hope you don't mind,

But I brought a friend.

What do you think of this?

It's nice.

I'm going to re-Decorate.

Why? I like it the way
that it is.

Oh, I like a change.

Did you say you brought
a friend?

Yeah.

Her name is Shiva...
That's unusual.

Yeah, and...

well actually she's
not just a friend.

She's my biological sister.

Half-Sister.

I only just met her.

So, it's new for me too.

But she's really great.

I think you'll like her.

I didn't know you were...

Why didn't you
tell me about this?

I don't know.

Have you contacted
your birth mother?

She passed away.

And I know that you
didn't want me to do that,

But since dad died,
I don't know...

I just...

I just don't understand why you
didn't talk to me about this.

Why so secret?

Just because I love you,

And I didn't want to hurt you.

So why did you bring
her here then?

I just wanted you to meet her.

And she has, I don't know...

Trouble with a boyfriend,

I thought...
I thought it would be nice

To have a night away.

Life is difficult enough without
inviting problems into it,

You know that.

She's not a problem, mom.

I just feel bad for her.

You know,
she doesn't have any family or anything,

She doesn't have anybody.

This is pretty, don't you think?

Hey.

Cody called.

Did you speak to him?

He left a message.

And?

<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

<i>I swear to god,
I just got out of jail, Shiva,</i>

<i>If you're not home
by the time I get back,</i>

<i>You're fucking dead.</i>

<i>You understand?</i>

What do you want to do?

Oh my god, isn't it too hot?

Mom, this is Shiva.

Shiva, this is my mom, Martha.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Wow, where are you going?

Oh, back to I.A.,
On a date.

No way...
Blind date.

Lynn set it up.

I'm too old to be dating, but...

Ah, you're never
too old to date.

Anyway, I hope you girls
enjoy yourselves,

Don't forget to leave
the alarm on when you leave.

Okay.
Bye, mom.

I know we'll be meeting again.

I hope so.

This is Dex, I gotta take it.
Sorry, mom.

See you. Bye.
- Bye.

Hello?
- <i>Hey, you.</i>

<i>I was looking
at the business account,</i>

Looks like there's
a thousand dollars missing.

<i>- Did you know</i> that?
I know.

<i>What, did you pay a bill?</i>

<i>Where did it go?
I don't understand.</i>

It's that gas guzzler,
again, isn't it?

We've got to get rid of it.
That's it.

We've got to sell it this week.

No more discussion, please.

It wasn't the car.

Okay?
I gave it to Shiva.

<i>Wait, what?</i>

I gave it to Shiva for her rent.

Are you being serious right now?

No, I thought it was
a good idea.

It felt like the right
thing to do.

<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

<i>I cannot believe
that you did not call me, may.</i>

<i>We're supposed to talk
to each other</i>

<i>And to make decisions like this.</i>

<i>We're a team.</i>

<i>This is unbelie...
We need that money,</i>

<i>For the first month of rent,</i>

If we don't get enough
students then we're gonna be...

Is this funny to you?

No, I just...
The line's breaking up,

I can't hear you anymore.

<i>- May?</i>
Hello?

<i>- May?</i>
Hello?

Oh, he's pissed.

And I haven't even told him
I'm out of town.

You're a beautiful,
powerful woman.

Some old bitch
told me that once.

<i>- Hey -
You wanna tell me</i> what's going on?

No, I don't know
what happened back there,

It just cut out.
So listen,

I am at my mom's place at
Santa Barbara with Shiva,

And I will be home
in time for class tomorrow.

<i>What?</i>

Yeah, and we did
drive the marlin,

And we used an entire
tank of gas,

And it was really fun.

I love that car

And I don't want to sell it.

Okay?
I love you so much, Dex.

Bye.

"May is passionate
about sharing this practice

"Which so profoundly
changed her life."

"It gives her great joy to see how peace
unfolds in the lives of her students."

It just sounds like bullshit.

I mean, honestly,
most the people that teach this

Wanna have a nice ass.

Nothin' wrong
with having a nice ass.

You wanna see my page?

You have a webpage?

An ad.
Here, give me.

"Angel will give you
the sexiest massage"

"With the happiest ending
you could dream of,"

"And nothing gives her
more pleasure."

As if.

It's all fucking bullshit.

Don't take it so seriously.

But it's different,
I mean yoga is about truth.

Isn't sex?

What was it like the first time

You... did it,

Like...

Well how else do you say it?

That I did it.

Mmm. Cody and I
were at this party,

And this guy came up to me,

And he was like,

"I'll give you 500 bucks
if you come home with me."

And of course
I thought he was kidding.

And then I realized he wasn't.

And then, I thought
Cody would fucking freak,

But he didn't.

We needed the money.

You gotta let your hair down
every once in a while.

Like a fucking pro.

Don't tell anybody.

Oh, fuck, oh I love this song.

Mmm.

I'm not coming up.
Come on.

<i>Yeah, she gave me
the money just like that.</i>

<i>Easiest money I ever made.</i>

Yeah, I can get more,
stop bitching at me.

She's rich, okay?

I'll be home this afternoon.

Um, okay.
Yeah, I love you. Bye.

Hey.

We should probably
get goin', huh?

Okay, yeah. Sure.

I'm not trying
to steal your money.

I just said that
because I don't want

Him to kill me when I get home.

If you don't want
to go back, don't.

Yeah?

You can stay with me and Dex
for a few nights.

Take this moment
to feel the calm in your body.

To feel the peace
in every cell of your being.

Rolling over onto your side,

Come up into a comfortable,
seated position.

Put your hands on your heart.

Gently opening your eyes,

Bringing that sense
of peace and oneness

To everything
that you see today.

<i>Namaste.</i>

<i>Namaste.</i>

Okay, you guys,
thank you so much.

See you next week, we're open.

Very exciting.

Bye, see you tomorrow.

Hey.

Hey.

So, what can I do for you?

Uh, Shiva left this
at our place.

Wouldn't happen to have
seen her would you?

Well, that's ironic, right?

"Shiva".

You know, I was uh,
I was born in new Mexico.

The home of the nuclear bomb.

Oh yeah?

Yeah, yeah.

You know what the guy
said who invented it,

When we saw
the first one explode,

You know what he said?

He said, "I am Shiva,

Destroyer of worlds."

You see, that's the thing
about Shiva,

You know,
you get too close to her,

And everything you ever loved
can be destroyed,

Just like the bomb.

That's funny,
speak of the devil, right?

What are you doing here?

Well, you know, it's funny,

'Cause I could ask
the same fucking thing to you.

What are you doing?

I'm hanging out,
I was just, um...

Gonna... I was gonna
come home soon.

Oh, really?
- Mmm-Hmm.

Wow.

You know, that was so nice of
you to call and let me know.

I mean, you girls
been having a nice time

While I was in jail?
Huh?

Shiva's gonna stay here
for a few nights.

Oh yeah?

Yeah.

I'm gonna get my stuff.

Anyway, like I was saying,

You never really know
what you're gonna get.

And it's not like
I imagine you two girls

Having much in common,
anyway, right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Excuse me.

Please don't leave with him.

You don't want to deal with this,
trust me.

I don't care.
I will call the police.

What are they gonna do?

They will make him leave.

Like he wouldn't come back.
I gotta go.

Please.

Look, remember how you said
that it was fate that we met?

That's what it's like
with me and Cody,

So there's no use
in fighting it.

This is exactly
what he wants you to think,

But you have a choice.

Pressure, that's it, man.
I understand this guy, right?

Uh... Dex.
Dex.

Dex is amazing,
he was just telling me

How yoga might help me
with my headaches.

You know, apparently,

I have too much
stress in my life.

I mean, I don't even know
how I get up in the morning.

Let's go.
All right, but you see,

The trouble is,
it's my girlfriend here,

She's always in a rush,
makes me crazy.

Hey, man,
I know exactly what you mean.

Uh, if you're interested
seriously, take that.

Baby, he doesn't want that.

Oh, Pico and Lincoln, yeah.

Yeah, exactly.
That's right above the print shop.

Okay, I'll look for it.

Thank you.
Cody.

Good to meet you.
Yeah, Dex.

All right.
Take care.

See you guys.

Why were you so nice to him?

He's your sister's boyfriend.

He is her pimp.

Shiva's a whore?

Don't call her that.

What do you want me to call her?

Prostitute?

A sex worker.

It doesn't make a difference.
Yeah, it does.

Fine, she's a sex worker.

And you gave her our money.

You know, Dex,
I just wanted to help her.

She probably set you up
from the beginning

So she could get our money.

Did you even think
about that, may?

Well, if she did,
she is welcome to it.

She needs it a lot more
than we do.

You're telling me
that this woman is a prost...

A sex worker, and it's okay

If she comes into our home?

Why does it matter to you
so much what she does?

Because I don't want
that energy in my house.

And neither should you.

What energy?

Okay, stop.
Let's just stop.

Let's just leave this.

<i>Let's go.
We're gonna be late.</i>

<i>Do you have the info?</i>

Here.

That's awesome.

We'll definitely be there.

See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
Yeah, see you. Bye.

What is that?

It's the money
that I gave Shiva,

And the key to our place
that she didn't take.

Good.
This is literally karma in action.

I have to get this to her right now.
Wh... May, just...

Let's take a while and think
about what you're doing.

I don't want to take a moment
to think about anything.

We'll be coming tomorrow.
Excellent.

<i>Namaste. Namaste.
Namaste.</i>

Okay, bye.

Let's not talk about
this here right now.

This is not appropriate.
You know what?

Fuck appropriate.

Shh. Let's just
talk about this outside.

What is it with you and this...

You know what,
this is what you're interested in?

This is all you fucking
care about?

Then you can fucking take it!

May.

May, stop right there!

Fuck you.

Don't you ever touch me
like that.

What is happening to you?

You're in there, and you're talking
about how you want to heal people?

But you only want to heal
people who have money.

I know one person,
right now, who needs help.

Okay, I'm not saying
don't help her,

I'm just saying
think this through.

She didn't take the money,
so she can't pay her rent.

And she doesn't have our key,
so she has no place to go.

You don't even know
who she really is.

I don't think you know
who I really am.

Where are you going, may?

May!

Shiva, it's me.
It's may.

Can you please open the door?

I really need to talk to you.

I know you're in there,

And I'm not leaving
until I see you.

What do you want?

You forgot these.

I don't need 'em.

Can we talk, please?
Can I come in?

I don't need anything, okay?

I know you don't.

So why did you come here?

Just take these from me, okay?

I don't need 'em.

I said I don't need 'em.

I'm not coming over.

What is that on your neck?

It's nothing, okay?
Just leave.

Come with me.

What's the fucking point?
He'll kill me.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

Oh, yeah, and how
are you going to stop it?

By chanting?

He loves me.

This is not love.

Yeah, well it's the closest
thing I've got, so...

You have me, now.

I love you.

<i>I love you.</i>

You don't count.

<i>Why not?</i>

Because you're a girl.

<i>Since when do girls not count?</i>

You count.

You fucking count.

Fuck!

Get in the fucking closet.

I'm not gonna get in the closet.

You and me,
we're gonna leave together

Get in the fucking closet.

<i>- Hi, baby.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

<i>What you watchin'?</i>

<i>Get your ass ready,
I've got a date for you.</i>

I want you to look
real pretty too.

<i>Don't I always look pretty?</i>

<i>Yeah, you always look pretty,</i>

<i>Just put some fucking makeup on.</i>

Who's the date?

Lonely ed.

<i>No.</i>
- Come on, man.

He loves you, that guy.
I already told you,

I'm not seeing that freak again.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. We need the fucking money.
I'm serious.

<i>I don't like that guy,
he really fucked me up last time.</i>

Aw, come here.

Come on, what?

You're not afraid of him,
are you? Huh?

Are you?
- I don't know.

Come on, that's bullshit.

Who loves you?

Who loves you?

You do.
Yeah, you're right.

You know, I'd walk
to the end of the earth

On broken shards
of glass for you,

You know that?
All right?

<i>I know.</i>

<i>So what are you... Huh?
What the fuck are you?</i>

You're a fearless fucking tiger,

That's what you are.

So come on,
give me these tiger titties

For a minute...

I got five minutes,
so, warm you up a little bit.

Baby, I'm hungry.

Can we go get something to eat?

Are you out
of your fucking mind? Huh?

How many fucking times
have I got to tell you,

I gotta fucking pay this rent.

Jesus Christ.

<i>Baby, I don't wanna see Ed,</i>

<i>I wanna... I wanna
be with you.</i>

<i>Let's go have some fun.</i>

<i>You've got
the fucking money for that?</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

You got the fucking money?

Open the money drawer.

Open it.

Open the fucking drawer!

<i>You see any money in there?</i>

<i>What do you see?</i>

Yeah. Give it to me.

<i>You wanna fuck us up?</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Give me one good reason</i>

<i>Why I shouldn't
shoot you right now,</i>

<i>You fucking bitch.</i>

Because you love me.

Well, I fucking hate you.

I fucking hate you.

What the fuck?

I'm sorry.

What the fuck is this shit?

Don't touch her.

Are you okay?

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

<i>Tell her.</i>

I'm not your sister.

I just wanted your money.

I'll see you downstairs.

<i>You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.</i>

<i>You owe me double now.</i>

<i>Yeah, all right, all right.</i>

<i>Yeah, we can make that happen.</i>

Yeah, she's available.

A little midnight special.

<i>All right,
I'll have her cleaned up</i>

<i>And send her over in an hour.</i>

<i>Bye.</i>

I need to speak to Shiva.

Did you just climb over my gate?

The girl... The girl
that just came in here.

I need to speak to her.

You've got the wrong house.

I'm gonna call
the cops, if you...

<i>What the fuck?</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

go ahead, call them.

Listen, uh...

We're all consenting
adults here.

I just watched a man
threaten to kill her,

So she would come here.
So don't talk to me about consent.

Okay, just...

Sh...
She's upstairs.

<i>Shiva, come on down.</i>

<i>It's okay.</i>

I don't think she can hear you.

Take me to her.

Look, why don't you
put the gun down?

Just take me to her.

<i>I had no idea that she came here</i>

<i>Under any duress, I swear.</i>

Slowly.

Move slowly.

Open it.

May, what the fuck?

Give me the key.

<i>Why don't you put the gun down?</i>

Give me the fucking keys!

The keys in my case.
- <i>Shut up and get it!</i>

I'll... I'll get it.
Do not let him go over there.

It's...
It's in my case.

Hey, don't go over there!
Take the safety off.

How?
Pull it back, take the safe...

What... Are you out
of your mind?

I said shut the fuck up,
so shut the fuck up.

Go to the case.
Go to the case.

Move over there.

Stay right there.

Right, right.

Oh, fuck.
There's a gun in there.

Okay... Okay?

Take his gun.

What? Why?
Why would I steal his gun?

You stole Cody's gun.
- That was different.

I'm not leaving him
with a fucking gun, okay?

Take the gun.

Go, go, go, go.

Stay there.
Wait. W... W... W... Wait.

Handcuff yourself to the bed.

<i>What?</i>
Handcuff yourself to the fucking bed.

Let's go.

Go, go.

I really don't want
to steal from him.

<i>Okay, fine.
Let's just fucking go.</i>

Those are his kids?

Yeah, probably.

<i>That is fucked.</i>

That's life.
Let's go.

No.

No.
- May, what the fuck?

What the fuck are you doing?

What the fuck?

The next time you're about to
pay to slap a woman around,

I just want you to stop
and take a deep breath,

And remember, that
that is someone's daughter.

What are you,
a fucking life coach?

I'm a yoga teacher.

<i>Namaste,</i> motherfucker.

Now we can go.

You're fucking insane.
I love it.

Oh, my god.

Oh my god is right.

You are fucking crazy.
Holy shit.

I am fucking crazy, I am.

Dude, you are fucking crazy.

You should have seen his face
when I went back up there.

You should have seen his face.
- Dude, dude.

I cannot believe you just
fucking did that for me.

Why did you do that for me...
Seriously?

I just...
I know that...

That you don't want
to be saved, and all, but...

Fuck what I said.
Oh my god,

Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before, ever.

Fuck.

Holy shit, it was amazing.

I lied, I am your sister.

<i>I wouldn't have cared.</i>

<i>It wouldn't have mattered.</i>

Fuck, it's Cody.

Don't answer.

Where are we going?

Where are you?

Hey, Dex,

Can you just do something
for me, please?

Can you just... There's a bunch of keys,
in a box by my shrine.

Can you...
Can you get them

And can you just bring
them to me?

<i>Why don't you just come home?</i>

<i>Listen, may.
I'd... I'd just like to talk to you.</i>

Just... Just meet me
at the parking lot on main.

<i>Please, just do this for me.</i>

<i>And make sure no one
follows you.</i>

Follow... May,
what are you talking about?

May.

Hey.

Have you got 'em?

Okay, do you want
to just tell me

What's going on?
Are you okay?

Yeah.

Well then, you wanna tell me why

I'm here in a parking lot,

Why you couldn't come home?

I just can't talk right now.

Do... Do you have
the keys?

Okay, may,
I just I wanted to apologize for earlier,

I... I should not
have gotten mad like that.

That's not... You know me,
that's not me, may.

I... I know, I know.

I'm sorry, too.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Okay.

I...

I think I need some space.

May, what are you...
We can work this out.

I don't know.

I... I'll... I'll call.
I'll call you.

May, wait,

Don't go with her.

May.

I'm sorry, Dex.

May.

I wasn't expecting you tonight.

Surprise visit.

Yeah, we'll stay here tonight.

And then,
you know, we'll just see...

We'll see what happens tomorrow.

Sounds good.
We'll figure it out.

We will.

You didn't give him
this address, did you?

No.

Are you sure
your mom's not home?

Yeah, she's
in I.A. Tonight.

Okay.

Oh, my god.

Mom?
- Oh, may.

I'm so sorry,
I didn't know you were here.

Christ, you scared
the life out of me.

God.
- Sorry.

Jesus.

Oh my god,
what happened to your face?

I had a peel today.

God, you scared me.

Hey, how was your date?

What is going on?

Nothing. Nothing, we just
had fun, we just came back.

Can we talk privately?

It's okay, you can talk freely

In front of Shiva, it's cool.

No, it's not cool, young lady.

This is not cool.

Dex told me what
you did with the money.

Well, you were
the one who told me

To put it to good use.

Not to give it to a prostitute.

Jesus, mom.

It's okay.

It's fine.

Okay, you know...
We're just...

We're just gonna rest
for a little bit,

And then we're gonna
leave in the morning.

Okay?

This is crazy.

I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

And I'm really sorry
that we woke you up,

But we would not have come here

If we knew
you were going to be here.

<i>Do you want some tea?</i>

No, I don't want some tea.

I want some respect
in my own home.

Mom,

Mom, who was that?

Her boyfriend is picking her up.

He's at the gate,
I told him to come and get her.

Shiva, get dressed.

We've got to get out of here.

What's going on?

Cody's here.

What?

Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.

No, no, no.

<i>You should be
with your boyfriend,</i>

<i>You should go home.</i>

Hello?

I know.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

<i>Okay. Okay.
I'm coming!</i>

Mom, call the police.
- No, please.

Call the police.
- Please don't call the police.

I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

Mom, why the fuck
did you let him in here?

<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

I'm going, okay?

I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

<i>Stop fucking around,
the game's over.</i>

<i>Let's go</i> home.
- Your daughter's amazing.

<i>I'm coming!</i>

<i>Shiva!</i>

Trust me.

<i>I swear to god,
I'm gonna count to ten,</i>

<i>And then I'm gonna kick
the fucking door in,</i>

<i>You understand?</i>

<i>One...</i>

<i>Two...</i>

I love you.

<i>Three...</i>

<i>Four...</i>

<i>Five...</i>

<i>Six...</i>

<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

I'm fucking
coming Cody, shut up!

I don't know why
you are so attached to her,

I really don't.

We shouldn't
have to deal with it,

She is not our family.

Get off me!
Get in the...

Get off me!

Ah! Ah!

Fuck...

Get off...

Get off me!

Oh that's cute.
What are you gonna do?

Are you gonna fucking shoot me?

I love you, you stupid fuck.

I ain't done with you.

Are you trying to kill me?

Are you trying to fucking
kill me, you bitch?

You wanna shoot me?

After everything I've fucking...

Cody, get off her.

Go fuck yourself.
Shut the fuck up!

I said, get off!

Are what the fuck
you gonna do about it?

Huh?
Are you gonna shoot me?

You know what she is, right?

She's a fucking whore...

Oh!

You fucking bitch.

Shiva is free.

You are never gonna
see her again.

Say it.

Shiva is free.

You know what?
Go fuck...
