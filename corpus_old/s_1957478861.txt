"TOTALLY SANTA"
FOR THE 21st CENTURY.

THE MAN, THE MYTH,
THE TITAN OF TOYS--

SANTA CLAUS WILL BE SPEAKING
IN 10 MINUTES!

Man: NEXT SUMMER,
I'M SEWING YOU A MUUMUU.

Sparky: ANY LAST MINUTE
GROOMING TIPS FOR SANTA?

YEAH. 3 WORDS:

GASTRIC BYPASS
SURGERY.

YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.

ONE MORE FAT JOKE,
AND I'M GONNA BYPASS YOU

RIGHT OUT THAT DOOR.

OH, NO. AND LOSE
THE BEST JOB IN FASHION?

TRYING TO STUFF YOU
INTO THE SAME RED SUIT

YEAR AFTER YEAR?

Sparky: OK, I KNOW
YOU GUYS ARE HAVING FUN

OVER HERE, ALL RIGHT?
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE GOT

TWO MINUTES, OK?

[CELL PHONE RINGS]
HELLO.

HOLD STILL!

I WOULD IF YOU'D
GET YOUR WIRES

OUT OF MY PANTS.

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A DENTIST.

I KNOW. WELL, I KNOW.

WELL, YOU KNOW,
INDIA'S THE NEXT CHINA.

THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

HA HA! NOBODY SAYS THAT!
COME ON.

SPARKY, WHAT ARE
TALKING ABOUT?

I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MARKET
AND THE CHRISTMAS FUTURES.

SO YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

NO. WHY WOULD I
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING

ABOUT THAT? I'M ONLY
SANTA CLAUS.

THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.

OK. YEAH, WELL,
I'M LOSING YOU.

I'M IN A TUNNEL.
OK. BYE-BYE.

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
EVERYBODY GO. OUT, OUT. GO.

PSST, PSST. GO, GO.

PSST. HEY.
GO, GO, GO, GO.

GO-GO, GO. GO, GO.

HERE.
WHAT'S THAT?

YOUR OPENING REMARKS.
I PROOFREAD THEM MYSELF.

DON'T BOTHER TO THANK ME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

SANTA'S IN THE HOUSE,
Y'ALL.

WHERE'S MY CHRISTMAS
PARTY PEOPLE AT?

IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
YEAH. I KNOW IT IS.

THE SHORTIES BETTER
BE GOOD, 'CAUSE

THIS TOTALLY SANTA
EXPO IS GONNA BE

OFF THE HINGES, YO.

YO. YEAH.

SPARKY, DO I REALLY
HAVE TO SAY THIS?

YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

OH, COME ON.

OH, EVERYONE KNOWS
THERE'S NO CHRISTMAS

WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

YEAH, BUT IS THIS REALLY
CHRISTMAS ANYMORE?

WHOA! NO!

TIME-OUT HERE.

THE WORLD'S CHANGING.

NOW, WE CAN EITHER
CHANGE WITH IT,

OR WE--OK. THAT'S--
LOOK, WILL YOU STOP

WORRYING?
GIVE ME A HUG.

COME ON, YOU BIG LUG.
COME ON.

NOW, COME ON.

NOW, THE KIDS,
THE KIDS OF THE WORLD.

THEY ARE NOT GONNA FORGET
ABOUT SANTA CLAUS, ALL RIGHT?

ESPECIALLY NOT AS LONG

AS I'M RUNNING
THIS TOY SHOP.

WHO ELSE AM I
THINKING ABOUT? HER?

NO. ME? NO! BARELY.

I NEVER REALLY THINK
ABOUT MYSELF.

YOU. I'M THINKING
ABOUT YOU, OK?

AND I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.
I NEVER LIE.

I USED TO LIE.
I DON'T TO THAT ANYMORE, OK?

I DON'T TRY IT.
IT DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL.

RIGHT. NOW, LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO GO OUT THERE.

AND YOU MAKE US PROUD...

SANTA CLAUS.

ALL RIGHT?

HAT! HAT! GET THE HAT!
WILL YOU GET THE HAT?

SMOKIN'.


Man on P.A.:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

THE MAN OF THE HOUR--

MR. SANTA CLAUS!

SANTA!
SANTA!

SANTA!

SANTA!

SANTA! SANTA!
SANTA! SANTA! SANTA!

SANTA!

SANTA, SANTA, SANTA, SANTA!



HO HO HO!

HO HO!


WHAT'S HAPPENING?

YEESH. SOMEBODY GET
A LOZENGE.

[CLEARS THROAT]

BETTER GO RESCUE HIM.

Jingle: JANGLE,
DO YOU EVER WONDER

WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF OUR SKY?

YOU'D KNOW IF YOU
WATCHED MORE TELEVISION.

TELEVISION? HOW CAN
YOU WATCH SO MUCH?

WHAT'S ON?

CHRISTMAS STUFF, MAN.

I LOVE THIS TIME
OF YEAR.

JUST LOOK AT ALL OF IT.

...GATHER UP ENOUGH...
TO CHANGE SANTA'S MIND.

THIS IS JULIE
KADLUBOWSKI-SANCHEZ

LIVE FROM THE SOUTH TOWN
MAIN STREET

WHERE I'M SPEAKING WITH
A VERY SPECIAL YOUNG MAN

NAMED IGGY THISTLEWHITE.

NOW, WHILE MOST KIDS
HIS AGE ARE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

WHAT'S THIS, JINGLE?

OR ADDING TO THE CHILDHOOD
OBESITY EPIDEMIC,

IGGY IS REALLY DOING
SOMETHING SPECIAL

TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER.

TELL US WHAT'S
GOING ON, IGGY.

ALL THESE GREAT PEOPLE
ARE GETTING READY FOR

THE NEW SOUTH TOWN
CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL.

IT'S THE FIRST
FESTIVAL IN 20 YEARS.

AND YOU'RE THE ORGANIZER.

THAT'S A PRETTY BIG JOB
FOR A 10-YEAR-OLD.

I'M JUST HAPPY
TO HELP BRING BACK

THIS GREAT TRADITION.

WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE ORIGINAL FESTIVAL, IGGY?

CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS,
THE SHRINKING TAX BASE,

OFFICIAL INDIFFERENCE.

HA HA! WELL, IF IGGY SOUNDS
LIKE A POLITICAL PRODIGY,

HE SHOULD. HIS FATHER
IS MAYOR THISTLEWHITE,

SOUTH TOWN'S MAYOR.

MR. MAYOR.

LET'S GO.

COME ON, COME ON. HI.

MR. MAYOR, WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF THE IDEA?

WELL, AS YOU KNOW,
MISS KADLUBOWSKI-SANCHEZ,

I HAVE COME OUT AGAIN
AND AGAIN AS BEING

OFFICIALLY PRO-FAMILY.

SO I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD
THAT MY OWN SON

HAS WORKED SO HARD
TO BRING THIS FESTIVAL

BACK TO ALL THE GOOD
PEOPLE OF SOUTH TOWN.

THANKS TO IGGY,

SOUTH TOWN IS SAYING HELLO
TO CHRISTMAS AGAIN.

I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU, DAD.

WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

BUT THE REAL CREDIT
BELONGS TO YOU.

AND OF COURSE,
OUR GREAT CORPORATE SPONSORS

WHOSE NAMES CAN BE FOUND
ON MY WEBSITE

MAYORTHISTLEWHITE.ORG.

WELL, IF YOU WILL
EXCUSE US,

IGGY AND I HAVE TO GET
TO WORK ON THE MAYOR'S BOOTH.

I HOPE YOU'LL BE
JOINING US FOR THE FESTIVAL.

I'LL BE BACK HERE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE

WITH BELLS ON.

CHRISTMAS BELLS,
THAT IS.

THIS IS JULIE...
MAN.

IT MAKES ME MISS
MY MOTHER AND FATHER.

THEY LIVE RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

OH, YEAH.

I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHO THOSE

BLACK PEOPLE WERE
NEXT DOOR.

LOOK, IT'S SPARKY
AT THE TOY EXPO.

SANTA'S EXCLUSIVE TOY LINE
FOR THE 21st CENTURY.

WHAT IS THAT?

IS THAT FELT?

UM, NO.

QUITE LOVELY.

YOU WERE SAYING?
RIGHT.

YOU ARE LOOKING AT
SANTA'S EXCLUSIVE TOY LINE

FOR THE 21st CENTURY.

COULD YOU REMOVE
YOUR HAT, PLEASE?

NO.

ONCE UPON A TIME,

SANTA HAD THE BIGGEST
TOY LINE IN THE WORLD.

WE SURRENDERED
OUR MARKET POSITION

TO THE MULTINATIONAL
TOY MANUFACTURERS.

BUT NOW THAT I,
NATHANIEL "SPARKY" THADDEUS III,

AM IN CHARGE,
WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.

ONCE AGAIN, WHEN KIDS
THINK OF TOYS,

THEY'RE GONNA
THINK SANTA CLAUS.

AAH!

THOSE ARE MY EARS.

THIS IS THE HIGH-TECH TOY
OF THE FUTURE, SANTA.

I'M SANTA CLAUS
NOT CIRCUIT CITY.

DO ME A FAVOR.
PUT THE DEVICE ON.

THESE ARE SAMPLE CLIPS
FROM THE GAMES

WE'LL ROLL OUT
OVER THE NEXT YEAR.

OHH! AAH!

AAH!
SEE? WASN'T THAT FUN?

LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
HAVING A GREAT TIME.

ALL RIGHT, NEXT BOOTH.

AND WHAT'S HE DO?

HE KILLS THIS GUY!

THE KIDS ARE GONNA
LOVE IT.

LOOK AT ME.

DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I LOVE IT?

RIGHT. HOLD ON.
HOW ABOUT NOW?

I DON'T LOVE IT.
SANTA?

MM.
SANTA DOESN'T LIKE IT.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

THERE'S A LOT OF OPENINGS
IN GIFT WRAPPING.

YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LOOK INTO THAT.

UNCLE SPARKY!

SORRY, KID.

IT'S A COMPETITION.
MAY THE BEST TOY WIN.

I GUARANTEE THIS WILL BE
THE BREAKOUT DOLL

FOR THE 6-12 DEMOGRAPHIC.

BEGOTHS.
THEY ROCK, YO!

SHE'S GOT LITTLE HOLES
IN HER EYEBROWS.

WITH THE BEGOTHS
PIERCINGS SOLD SEPARATELY.

FOLLOWED BY
BEGOTHS FRIENDS.

THEY ROCK.
BEGOTHS PETS.


BEGOTH TEENS.

BABY BEGOTHS.

BABY BEGOTHS PETS.

THE BEGOTH
"BAKE IT IN BLACK"

TECHNO OVEN.
SO HOT!

WHOA!

HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DELIVER ALL THIS STUFF?

SANTA, YOU JUST DELIVER
THE FIRST BEGOTHS DOLL.

buy the rest.

WELL, THAT'S A HECK
OF A THING TO DO

TO HARDWORKING FAMILIES.

HOW ABOUT WE GET
YOU A SNACK?

I DON'T GET IT.
BABY BEGOTH, BABY BEGOTH PETS.

TECHNO OVENS.

WHAT THE HECK DO KIDS
WANT NOWADAYS?

MORE.

I NEED SOME AIR.


HI. IT'S SPARKY.

LISTEN, MRS. C.
NO, I'M GOOD.

YEAH. PLEASE.
MRS. C...

I THINK YOU'D BETTER
GET DOWN HERE.

YOUR HUSBAND.
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.


IS IT THAT BAD?

IT'S WORSE.

OH, COME ON.

YOU ALWAYS GET
A LITTLE STRESSED

BEFORE THE BIG NIGHT.

IT'S NOT EASY
BEING SANTA CLAUS.

I'M NOT SANTA CLAUS
ANYMORE.

I'M A TOY DELIVERY
DIVISION OF SANTA CO.

MAMA, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS?

NOW ANYBODY CARES ABOUT
ARE GIGABYTES,

ACTION HEROES,
ACCESSORIES.

I DON'T FIT IN ANYMORE.

OH. PEOPLE DO STILL

CARE ABOUT CHRISTMAS.

AND I'M GOING TO
PROVE IT TO YOU.

YOU GOT A QUARTER?

â™ª DECK THE HALLS WITH
BOUGHS OF HOLLY â™ª

â™ª FA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA... â™ª

HMM. I WANT YOU
TO LOOK. GO ON.

â™ª FA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA LA â™ª

OH, THERE'S A WHOLE
WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE

DOWN THERE WHO LOVE YOU.

I THINK YOU FORGET
THAT SOMETIMES.

Woman: OH, THANK YOU.

GIVE ME THAT!

MY DAUGHTER'S
AN HONOR STUDENT.

WHERE?
AT BARTENDING SCHOOL?

[FIGHTING CONTINUES]

â™ª BECAUSE
IF YOU ASK ME â™ª

â™ª SANTA, YOU SUCK
SANTA, YOU SUCK â™ª

OH!

â™ª SANTA, YOU SUCK â™ª

SO MUCH FOR THAT IDEA.

[DIALING CELL PHONE]

JINGLE, I NEED YOU AND
JANGLE TO COME GET US.

[REINDEER GROWLS]

OH. THANKS FOR COMING ON
SUCH SHORT NOTICE, DOC.

THIS IS IMPORTANT.

[DOOR CLOSES]

LET'S GO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

Doctor: I WOULD HAVE GOT
HERE SOONER,

BUT I JUST CAME BACK
FROM THE DIVIDE.

Mrs. C: THAT'S
A LONG, HARD TRIP.

YEP. I'M GETTING TOO OLD
FOR COMBAT ZONES.

THE BROTHERS HEAT
AND SNOW MISER ARE

HAVING ANOTHER WAR.

ONE DAY THOSE IDIOTS ARE
REALLY GONNA HURT SOMEONE.

I DON'T NEED A DOCTOR.
I NEED MY LIFE BACK.

WHAT DID YOU HAVE
FOR BREAKFAST?

WHICH ONE?

CUTTING BACK
ON THE COFFEE?

THE ONE PLEASURE
I HAVE LEFT IN LIFE...

AHH...

OTHER THAN YOU,
MY DARLING?

TAKE OFF YOUR HAT.

WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO THIS BODY OF YOURS.

IT'S AMAZING
YOU'RE STILL STANDING.

RIDING AROUND THE WORLD
IN THE DEAD OF WINTER

IN AN OPEN SLEIGH,
AND FOR WHAT?

TO DELIVER PRESENTS
TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

WHO DON'T GIVE A HOOT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

TELL ME ABOUT IT.

NO MATTER WHAT YOU
GIVE THESE KIDS

IT'S NEVER ENOUGH.

NEXT YEAR THEY WANT
SOMETHING NEWER,

BIGGER, FASTER.

BEGOTHS!

OH, COME ON NOW, YOU TWO.
YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT MORE

THAN JUST THE PRESENTS.

WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT
CHRISTMAS CHEER AND GOOD WILL?

WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU'VE SEEN ANY?

EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

TAKE SOME
DEEP BREATHS.

BOYS!

PLEASE.

WHAT HE MEANS IS
THE EXPO'S A MADHOUSE.

WHAT I MEAN IS
WHAT I SAID.

I'M SICK OF CHRISTMAS.
TOO MANY TOYS,

TOO MANY UNGRATEFUL
CHILDREN.

ALL I AM IS A T.D.P.

A WHAT?

TOY DELIVERY PLATFORM.

THAT'S WHAT SPARKY
CALLS ME.

YEAH, WELL, SPARKY'S GOT
PROBLEMS OF HIS OWN.

THANKS, DOC,
FOR COMING BY.

I'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW HE'S DOING.

LOOKS LIKE HE'LL LIVE.

I'LL CHECK BACK
ON YOU LATER.

OH, AND MERRY CHRISTMAS.

JINGLE. JANGLE.

WHAT'S UP, DOC?

[WHISTLING TUNE]

Santa: NAUGHTY OR NICE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ANYMORE?

AND I DEFY ANYBODY
TO FIND ME ONE CHILD

THAT REALLY CARES ABOUT
THE TRUE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS.

OH, YOU'RE JUST TIRED.

YEAH. I'M TIRED.

TIRED OF CHRISTMAS.

WELL, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
AFTER YOU GET SOME REST.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

REST IS WHAT I NEED.

REST IF WHAT I'M GONNA GET.

CALL THE ELVES.

TELL 'EM TO CANCEL
CHRISTMAS.

THIS IS GOING TO BE
A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

MAN!

IF SANTA SKIPS CHRISTMAS,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US?

I GOT A COUSIN
WHO'S A DENTIST

ON THE ISLAND
OF MISFIT TOYS.

MAYBE HE COULD USE
A COUPLE OF ASSISTANTS.

WE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING, MAN.

AND THAT'S IT?

WELL, IT'S DOING
SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

SANTA NEEDS TO ACCEPT
THE FACT THAT HIS NEGATIVE

THOUGHTS ARE CREATING
THEIR OWN REALITY.

SANTA NEEDS TO CHANGE
HIS WAY OF THINKING.

WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?

DR. LAURA.
TV'S FAVORITE THERAPIST.

WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN SOMEBODY YOU LOVE,

SOMEBODY YOU CARE ABOUT,
SOMEBODY YOU RESPECT

HAS LOST THEIR SENSE OF
PURPOSE IN LIFE,

AND THE ONLY THOUGHTS
THEY'RE HAVING ARE NEGATIVE?

YOUR JOB IS TO TRY TO
HELP THEM BACK ON TRACK.

SO, GO DO THE RIGHT THING.

DR. LAURA.

NICE HAIR.

YOU KNOW WHAT COULD
CHANGE SANTA'S THINKING?

A REAL LITTLE
EARTH BOY

WITH TRUE CHRISTMAS
SPIRIT.

I WONDER WHERE WE GET
ONE OF THOSE.

HOW'D I DO?

WELL, YOU KEEP
THAT UP, KID,

AND YOU CAN BE
A SLICK POLITICIAN

JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME.

I GOT A TOXIC SPILL
TO COVER.

I GOT ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
I GOT TO GO.

I'LL SEE YOU.
HEY, IGSTER.

WHERE YOU GOING, DAD?

I GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE HOUSE AND MEET

WITH THOSE
NEW YORK GUYS.

THAT WAS A GREAT STORY
FOR SOUTH TOWN, SON.

BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO WORK

IN THE BOOTH TOGETHER.

WELL, SORRY, IGSTER, BUT
THIS MEETING CAME UP.

IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

WELL, CAN'T YOU
PUT IT OFF?

NO. I'M AFRAID NOT.

IGGY UNDERSTANDS.
DON'T YOU, SON?

AFTER ALL, I'M NOT
JUST YOUR DAD.

YOU'RE THE MAYOR, TOO.

THAT'S MY BOY.

WAY TO WORK
THE MEDIA, SON.

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

IGGY, YOU KNOW YOUR DAD.

SOMETIMES HE JUST MAKES
PROMISES HE CAN'T KEEP.

HE USED TO KEEP THEM.

HEY, HOW ABOUT IF I STAY
AND HELP YOU BUILD THE BOOTH?

THAT'S OK.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

OK. WELL, IN THAT CASE,

I'M GONNA GO DO
SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

I CAN'T LEAVE IT ALL
UP TO SANTA CLAUS.

SANTA CLAUS IS JUST
KID'S STUFF.

HEH. DON'T FORGET
TO GO TO SCHOOL, HON.

LOVE YA.

Man: YOU HAVE
A VERY NICE HOUSE.

THANKS FOR
HAVING US OVER.

MY PLEASURE.

I SAW YOUR SON ON TV.
YOU MUST BE PROUD.

I SURE AM.

YOU KNOW, HE REALLY
SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND SOUTH TOWN.

YEAH. WELL, HE SAYS
HE WANTS TO GROW UP

AND BE JUST LIKE ME.

SHRINKING TAX BASE,
CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS,

OFFICIAL INDIFFERENCE--
HE KIND OF SUMMED IT ALL UP,

DIDN'T HE?

WE ARE WORKING ON
OUR PROBLEMS.

AND WE WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU.

YOU NEED TO THINK
OF OUR RETAIL CENTER

AS KIND OF A HEART
TRANSPLANT FOR SOUTH TOWN.

IT'LL PUMP FRESH
ECONOMIC BLOOD

RIGHT TO YOUR CITY.

GREEN BLOOD,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE DO THIS RIGHT.

SOUTH TOWN'S A REAL CITY.

WITH REAL HISTORY.

I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT.

WELL, A GHOST TOWN
HAS A HISTORY, TOO.

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
SOUTH TOWN TO BECOME?

CHRISTMAS FESTIVALS
ARE CUTE,

BUT ISN'T IT TIME THAT YOU DID
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA WORK?

THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.


Sparky: LOOK, MAYBE
SANTA TAKING A YEAR OFF

WAS A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

WELL, WE GOT
THE BRAND-NEW TOY LINE

TO ROLL OUT, AND THAT'S
A LOT OF TOYS TO BUILD

AND DELIVER, YOU KNOW.

OH, WOW. WAIT.
GENIUS MIGRAINE.

HOLD ON.

I HAVE AN IDEA.

WHAT'S THAT?

WHAT IF WE POSTPONED
OR RESCHEDULED...

CHRISTMAS IN JULY?

CHRISTMAS IN JULY?

I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW!

THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

I LITERALLY SAID
THAT TO MYSELF.

I SAID,
"CHRISTMAS IN JULY?"

BUT THEN I ASKED MYSELF,

"WHY DOES CHRISTMAS
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

ON DECEMBER 25th?"

WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT
THAT DATE ANYWAY?

PLUS, A CHRISTMAS IN JULY
IS MUCH MORE FAIR

FOR THOSE OF US WITH A BIRTHDAY
IN LATE DECEMBER.

AND I'M SORRY,
BUT A SINGLE PRESENT

FOR BOTH BIRTHDAY
AND CHRISTMAS?

THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

WE ARE NOT
RESCHEDULING CHRISTMAS.

LOOK, I FEEL AS BADLY
ABOUT SANTA AS YOU DO.

I REALLY DO, BUT THINGS
HAVE CHANGED.

NOW, NOW I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE FACTS

ON THE GROUND, OK?

AND THE FACTS ARE:
SANTA'S IN BED,

COVERS OVER HIS HEAD,

READY TO BLOW OFF
CHRISTMAS.

HE'LL GET OVER IT.

I HOPE SO.

BUT I'D BE LYING
TO MYSELF IF I SAID

I DIDN'T SEE
THIS COMING.

AND I DON'T LIE.
I TRIED THAT.

IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

IT JUST AIN'T MY CUP
OF SWISS MISS.

LOOK, OK.

HERE ARE THE TIMES.
HERE'S SANTA. ALL RIGHT?

HIYA, SANTA.
HIYA, TIMES.

AND THEY'RE OFF. WHOA.

SANTA AIN'T KEEPING UP
WITH THE TIMES.

OK. I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

BUT WHAT DO WE DO TO GET
SANTA TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES?

I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED.

BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON THIS WHOLE

NEW SANTA EXPERIENCE,
SOMETHING THAT WILL

UPDATE HIS IMAGE AND GET

THE KIDS INTERESTED
AGAIN, OK?

I JUST GO THIS INSTALLED.

OH, LOVELY.

I LIKE IT, TOO.

MRS. C, IT IS
MY PLEASURE

TO INTRODUCE TO YOU--
AHEM--STREET SANTA.


HE'S A CROSS BETWEEN
TONY HAWK AND SPIDERMAN.

HE'S RIPPED.

HE WEARS A SKIN-TIGHT
GREEN JUMPSUIT.

AND HE FLIES AROUND
ON A FLYING SNOWBOARD

POWERED BY THE MAGIC
OF AWESOMENESS.

IT CAN'T FAIL.
IT WON'T MISS.

HE WILL NEVER
FIT INTO THAT.

I KNOW. IT'S SO SAD.

SO I THOUGHT WE HIRE
A SUBSTITUTE SANTA

FOR THE YEAR.

WAIT, WAIT. NO.

NO. NO ONE COULD EVER
REPLACE SANTA.


DO YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY?

DO YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL

ABOUT THAT JOLLY OLD
BARREL OF FUN?

DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD
ME THE OTHER DAY?

HE TOLD ME THAT
I'M LIKE THE SON

HE NEVER HAD.

OK, SONNY.

HELP ME TO GET HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND

BECAUSE ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER,

SANTA IS GONNA BE
ON THAT SLEIGH

CHRISTMAS EVE!

[DOOR SLAMS]

JINGLE, THE ONLY WAY
TO SOUTH TOWN IS

THROUGH HEAT MISER
AND SNOW MISER'S LAND.

ARE YOU SURE?

I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
THIS MAP'S A LITTLE STRANGE.

WHAT? WHY?

THAT'S NOT A MAP, THAT'S
TODAY'S TV LINEUP.

MAYBE WE SHOULD
TURN AROUND.

NEVER!

ON SECOND THOUGHT.
LOOK!

GET READY FOR
SOME SHOCK AND AWE. HA!

YOUR AIM STINKS WORSE
THAN YOUR SULFUR BREATH.

USING THE BOSWORTH BOX,

CREATE A PRODUCTION

DISPLAYING HOW CHRISTMAS
EFFECTS THE ECONOMY.

ANSWER THE QUESTION:

DO YOU THINK THIS CHRISTMAS

IF SO, WHY

OR WHY NOT?

I THINK I JUST SAW
A FLYING REINDEER.


IGGY...

WERE YOU DAYDREAMING AGAIN?

I GUESS SO.

YOU'VE SPOILED
MY BOSWORTH BOX.

BUSTED.

THAT JUST EARNED YOU
AN EXTRA HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

WRITE AN ESSAY EXPLAINING WHY
IT IS AERODYNAMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

FOR A REINDEER TO FLY.

["POP GOES THE WEASEL" PLAYING]

HA HA HA HA!

TOYS USED TO BE A LOT
MORE FUN AND SIMPLE.

NOW THEY'RE GOTH.

HERE. MAYBE THIS
WILL CHEER YOU UP.

MM-HMM.

WELL, THIS AIN'T MINE.

WELL, IT'S ADDRESSED TO
YOU FROM ALL THOSE KIDS

WHO SUPPOSEDLY
DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

COMPUTER-GENERATED
GIFT O' GRAM.

NOW THAT'S CARING.

OH! IT'S HERE.

WHAT'S HERE?

OUR FUTURE.

WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

MYTHOPOLIS?

IS IT A RETIREMENT
HOME OR A CEMETERY?

WHO SENT YOU THIS?

ABE.

THE ABOMINABLE
SNOWMAN LIVES HERE?

YEP.

WHEN PEOPLE STOPPED
CHASING HIM, HE GOT BORED.

NOW HE'S A SNOWMAN
OF LEISURE.

MYTHOPOLIS,
THE SENIOR COMMUNITY

DESIGNED WITH THE MATURE
MYTH IN MIND.

HELLO, I'M HERCULES.

AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

YOUR DAYS OF KILLING
9-HEADED HYDRO MONSTERS

ARE BEHIND YOU.

NOW IT'S TIME TO ENTER
A WHOLE NEW WORLD

OF FUN AND EXCITEMENT.

SO COME IN, OLD FRIEND.

THE FUN'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

HEY, BLUE.

IT'S A PLACE WHERE OLD FABLES
CAN FEEL FABULOUS AGAIN.

YOU HAVING FUN, MEDUSA?

ABSOLUTELY,
YOU STUD MUFFIN.

OH, MAN.

OUT OF THIS WORLD FUN.

HERE AT MYTHOPOLIS.

FORGET IT.

I WOULD RATHER
JUMP OFF THE DIVIDE

THAN MOVE
TO MYTHOPOLIS.

COME ON, BABY.
IT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
ARE THERE.

YOU HAVE FRIENDS HERE
WHO NEED YOU.

YEAH? TO SIGN
THEIR PAYCHECKS!

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU BECOME A CORPORATION.

YOU'LL FEEL 3,000 YEARS YOUNG
WHEN YOU MOVE TO MYTHOPOLIS.

1, 2, 3, 4.


$5.00!

I HOPE IT'S AS GOOD
AS THE CANDY WE USUALLY GET

AT THE NORTH POLE.

I BET IT AIN'T.

VIXEN!

NOW WHAT WE GONNA DO?

I DON'T KNOW.

MAN, MAYBE WE'RE IN
OVER OUR HEADS.

WE CAN CALL SPARKY.
HE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

HE'LL BE FURIOUS.

NOT AS FURIOUS
AS THE BIG GUY

IF WE DON'T GET
VIXEN BACK.

WE SHOULD CALL SPARKY.

NOT DR. LAURA?

COME ON.

JINGLE, STOP.

THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

YOU COULD BE DESTROYING
VALUABLE FORENSIC EVIDENCE.

HMM...

WHAT EXACTLY IS
FORENSIC EVIDENCE?

WHERE'S MY STUFF

AND OUR MAP?

AND THE SANTA
CELL PHONE?

WE REALLY ARE
A COUPLE OF E.T.s

THAT CAN'T PHONE HOME.

E.T.s?

ELF TYPES.

WE REALLY GOT TO FIND
THAT IGGY.

YEAH. MAYBE HE CAN
HELP US.

CLOP? WHERE ARE
JINGLE AND JANGLE?

UH, THEY WENT
ICE FISHING.

WHERE?

THE ICE?

NOW, WHY WOULD
THEY GO AND DO THAT

WITHOUT TELLING ME?

I KNOW. THAT IS
JUST SO RUDE.

I MEAN, WHO DO
THEY THINK THEY ARE?

TALK.

THEY MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO SQUEAL.

I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

ALL I KNOW IS THEY TOOK
A MAP OF THE DIVIDE WITH THEM.

THE DIVIDE?

YOU DON'T PASS OVER
THE DIVIDE, UNLESS...

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM HERE?

'CAUSE THIS IS A SCHOOL.

THIS IS WHERE KIDS
HANG OUT ALL DAY.

YOU NEVER SEEN
"SOUTH PARK"?

WELL, HOW LONG DO
THEY KEEP 'EM HERE?

ABOUT 7 HOURS.

REALLY? WHAT DO THEY
PAY 'EM FOR GOING TO SCHOOL?

NOTHING.
NOT A DIME.

WELL, NO WONDER THERE'S
NO CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

Boy: HEY, DO YOU WANT
TO GO THROW SOME BALLS AROUND?

SORRY. I'M GOING TO
TOKEN TOWN WITH TOMMY.

OH, COOL. I WAS JUST
THERE YESTERDAY.

THERE HE IS.
THERE'S IGGY.

REALLY?
WHAT'D YOU WIN?

NOTHING, BUT I'M
SAVING UP MY TICKETS.

OH.
SEE YA.

BYE.

IGGY!

KIDS. WE'RE TWO ELVES
FROM THE NORTH POLE.

YEAH, RIGHT.

NO, REALLY, WE ARE.

PROVE IT.

YOU ASKED FOR IT.

NO. DON'T.

EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES
CALL FOR EXTREME MEASURES.

POINTED EARS ARE THE MARK OF
A TRUE CHRISTMAS ELF.

FEW MORTALS HAVE
EVER SEEN THEM.

COME ON.
BIG DEAL.

JOSH'S OLDER BROTHER
PIERCED HIS EARS

WITH A CROWBAR.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

WE'RE HERE BECAUSE
WE NEED TO FIND A KID

THAT BELIEVES THE TRUE
SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS.

IF WE DON'T, IT'LL BE
A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

SANTA CLAUS?

I THINK YOU TWO
ARE LOOKING FOR

THE PRESCHOOL.

NO. WE'RE LOOKING
FOR YOU.

I SAW YOU ON TV
TALKING ABOUT SANTA CLAUS.

SO, ARE YOU READY
TO MEET SANTA?

I WOULD BE, EXCEPT
I DON'T BELIEVE

IN SANTA CLAUS.

HOW CAN YOU NOT BELIEVE
IN SANTA CLAUS?

HE'S TOO YOUNG
TO THINK SO OLD.

Boy: HEADS UP!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LET PEOPLE SEE US

BREAK THE LAWS OF
THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

SO YOU'RE ELVES THAT
ESCAPED FROM THE CIRCUS.

BIG DEAL.

HEY! DO YOU TWO HAVE
PERMISSION

TO BE HERE? HEY!
STRANGER DANGER.

STRANGER DANGER.

WHAT ARE YOU GAWKING AT?

YOU'RE A GREEK
GODDESS, AREN'T YOU?

ISN'T THAT
A SALAD DRESSING?

SHUT UP.

I TRY TO HIDE
MY RADIANCE UNDER

THESE SPORTY ENSEMBLES,
BUT SOMETIMES

IT JUST SHINES THROUGH.

I'M ARTEMIS,
PROTECTOR OF YOUTH.

HARDLY ANYBODY
BELIEVES IN ME ANYMORE.

SO, NOWADAYS I PROTECT
YOUTH FREELANCE.

SCHOOL.
PLAYGROUND LEVEL.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ALL THE KIDS AROUND HERE?

THEY DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING--

NOT EVEN SANTA CLAUS.

ALL PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN NOWADAYS IS

MATERIAL THINGS.

IF THEY CAN'T SEE IT
OR BUY IT,

IT DOESN'T EXIST
TO THEM.

I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO
KEEP HAMMERING AWAY AT IGGY

UNTIL HE SEES THE MAGIC
OF CHRISTMAS IS REAL.

YOU WORK OUT?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WORK OUT.

HELLO.

STOP MACKING
AND STACKING, MAN.

HE'S GONE.

TRYING TO MAKE BOOTY CALLS
ON THE CLOCK.

THAT'S TOO MUCH...

IGGY! HEY, IGGY.

I DON'T TALK
TO STRANGERS.

YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A GOOD RULE USUALLY,

BUT WE'RE NOT
STRANGERS; WE'RE ELVES.

I ALSO DON'T TALK TO GUYS
WHO THINK THEY'RE ELVES.

I WOULD LOVE
TO BELIEVE IN SANTA,

BUT I ONLY BELIEVE IN
THINGS I CAN SEE AND TOUCH.

REALLY? HEY, YOU SEE
A SUNSET, TOUCH A PUPPY.

YEAH, AND I CAN SEE
A SUNSET AND TOUCH A PUPPY.

BAD EXAMPLE.

LOOK, WE SAW YOU
TALKING ON TV

ABOUT YOUR CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL
AND HOW YOU WANTED

TO BRING CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
BACK TO SOUTH TOWN.

WELL, SANTA CLAUS NEEDS
YOUR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

I GOTTA GO, GUYS.
EVERYONE'S WAITING FOR ME.

WHERE YOU GOTTA GO?

A PARTY AT TOKEN TOWN.

WHAT'S TOKEN TOWN?

HELLO, SANTA CLAUS.

WELCOME TO
THE 21st CENTURY.

HO HO HO!

FINALLY, A SANTA KIDS
CAN RELATE TO.

YEAH. NO MORE OLD MAN
IN A FAT SUIT.

DO YOU THINK I COULD
GET ONE OF THOSE

6 PACK AB PLATES
THAT SUPERHEROES WEAR?

YOU KNOW, NOT THAT
I NEED ONE, BUT FOR FUN.

MM. ABSOLUTELY.

THE 6 PACK IS SO "NOW."

AAH!

COME ON IN.
MY DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN.

NO NEED TO KNOCK.

SPARKY, HAVE YOU SEEN
JINGLE OR JANGLE LATELY?

I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
THEM ANYWHERE.

NO. THE LAST TIME
I SAW THEM WAS

AT THE TOY EXPO.

I'M WORRIED THEY MAY
HAVE GONE ACROSS THE DIVIDE.

WHAT?

THE MISER BROTHERS
ARE AT WAR AGAIN.

THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'LL MAKE IT

ACROSS THE DIVIDE.

THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

WE HAVE TO TELL SANTA.

Santa: THEY WHAT?!

WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY
STOP THEM?

NOBODY KNEW.

AND MY GUESS IS THEY
WERE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

HELP ME?!

YOU SAID YOU WERE
CANCELING CHRISTMAS

BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK
ANYONE BELIEVED IN YOU ANYMORE,

BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK THERE
WAS ANY REAL CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

I THINK THEY WENT LOOKING
TO PROVE YOU WRONG.

WELL, I DIDN'T
ASK 'EM TO.

THEY LOVE YOU,
YOU OLD GOAT.

ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T
MATTER ANYMORE,

BECAUSE THEY'VE PROBABLY
BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY

BY THE MISER BROTHERS.

AND VIXEN ALONG WITH THEM.

HEY, HEY...HEY.
COME ON NOW, YOU TWO.

WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

THEY MAY VERY WELL
HAVE MADE IT ACROSS.


I JUST HOPE OUR
LITTLE FELLAS ARE SAFE.

SPARKY.

GET MY SLEIGH LOADED.

WE'RE GONNA PAY
A LITTLE CALL

ON THE MISER BROTHERS.

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

I WAS JUST GONNA SAY,
"SANTA, HOW ABOUT YOU

"TELL ME TO GO LOAD UP
YOUR SLEIGH

THEN WE COULD PAY A CALL
ON THE MISER BROTHERS?"

ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT.
THAT'S LIKE...

LIKE...
SPARKY, GO.

TELEPATHY. THAT'S LOONY
THAT THAT HAPPENED.

GO!

BUT THAT IS KIND OF CRAZY
THAT I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

IT'S LIKE TELEPATHY.

LIFE'S FUNNY.

HOW'D YOU BEAT US HERE?

A BIT OF THAT
CHRISTMAS MAGIC

YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN.

WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

PLAY ARCTIC THUNDER.

HOW IS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
GONNA HELP US?

DON'T KNOW.

BUT I'M ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

FREE. HA HA HA!

ALL RIGHT!

WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT!

WHOO!

[CHEERING AND LAUGHING]

NO HANDS. NO HANDS.

WHO THE MAN?


YEAH!

WOW.

THAT'S HOW WE DO IT
IN THE ARCTIC.

THROW THE "A" UP.

HA HA!
I WANT TO DANCE.

[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING]

JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!

Boy: WHOO HOO!

JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!

JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!

JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!

COME ON, IGGY.
YOUR TURN, BUDDY.

I DON'T...
YOU GOT IT.

COME ON, IGGY.
COME ON. YOU GOT IT.

SPIN AROUND.
BREAK IT DOWN.

ROCK.

IGGY'S IN THE HOUSE.

IGGY'S IN THE HOUSE.

WHAT?

YEAH!

WHOO!

OOH, YEAH!

WHOA.

HERE YOU GO.
ENJOY.

THAT'S ALL HE GETS
IS A YO-YO?

THAT'S IT.
SORRY.

ALL THEM TICKETS?
IT'S A GYP, MAN.

IT'S A GYP.

NOW DO YOU BELIEVE
WE'RE SANTA'S ELVES?

NO. BUT I BELIEVE
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING

AT VIDEO GAMES.

AND PRETTY GOOD
FRIENDS, TOO.

THANKS. THAT WAS
THE MOST FUN I EVER HAD.

[CAR HORN HONKING]

THEN WHY CAN'T YOU
HELP US SAVE CHRISTMAS?

THAT'S MY RIDE.
I GOT TO GO.

BYE.

THIS IS GONNA HURT ME
TO MY STOMACH TO SAY THIS.

BUT MAYBE EVERYTHING
YOU SEE ON TV IS NOT TRUE.

MAYBE IGGY'S NOT THE KID
TO SAVE SANTA CLAUS.

WHAT WOULD DR. LAURA DO?

"EARNING THE TRUST OF
A NEW FRIEND IS LIKE

"GAINING ENTRANCE IN
A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

IT GROWS A LITTLE BIT
EVERY DAY."

RIGHT.

SO WE KEEP TRYING.

NOT JUST FOR CHRISTMAS
BUT FOR SANTA.

FOR SANTA.

WHAT A YEAR OFF THIS
IS TURNING OUT TO BE.

OH, COME ON, SANTA.

DON'T YOU GET
ALL POOPY ON US.

YOU'LL GET YOUR
VACATION, I PROMISE.

IT'S NOT A VACATION.
IT'S A PROTEST.

AND A VACATION.

WHATEVER IT IS, YOU'LL
GET IT, ALL RIGHT?

THAT, MY FRIEND,
THAT I PROMISE.

SPARKY, THERE!

JANGLE'S TV.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'D
LEAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

THAT'S NOT COOL.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]


LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

FREAZOIDS AND FIRE PUNKS,

WELCOME TO MISER JAM!

10 ROUNDS OF BOXING

BETWEEN THE KEEPERS OF
THE CLIMATE,

THOSE WIZARDS OF WEATHER,

THE MISER BROTHERS!

IN THIS CORNER
WEARING SILVER TRUNKS,

HE PUT THE COLD BACK
IN COLD-BLOODED,

THE LORD OF THE NORTH,
OUR VERY OWN...

SNOW MISER!

[CHEERS AND JEERS]

AND IN THIS CORNER,
HIS TRUNKS ARE RED,

FLAMES SHOOT FROM HIS HEAD,

AND IF YOU CAN'T STAND
THE HEAT,

GET OUT OF HIS KITCHEN--
THE SULTAN OF THE SOUTH,

THE ONE AND ONLY
HEAT MISER!

GENTLEMEN, I WANT
A CLEAN AND FAIR FIGHT.

WHAT?
WHAT?

[BELL RINGS]

I HATE TO STOP THEM.

I'D LOVE TO SEE
THESE KNUCKLEHEADS

KNOCK THEIR BLOCKS OFF.

BUT DUTY CALLS.

SORRY, SANTA.

THIS IS A JOB FOR
A YOUNG AND VIRILE MAN.

DON'T TRY TO STOP ME.

YOU'RE AN ELF.

THE FIGHT IS...

OVER.

SANTA!

HELP! GIVE ME SOME HELP!

HELP! OVER HERE!

IT'S A HERNIATED DISK.

STOP!

SANTY CLAUS.

IF WE KNEW YOU WANTED
TO SEE THE FIGHT,

WE WOULD HAVE SENT
YOU A TICKET.

YOU KISS ASS.
I'M NO KISS ASS.

LISTEN, YOU BOZOS,

TWO OF MY ELVES DISAPPEARED
INTO THE DIVIDE

AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
HEARD FROM SINCE.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THEM?

UH, ELVES?
THE DIVIDE?

[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]
SORRY, SANTA.

I'M TOO BUSY.

TIME TO SUMMON
THE BIG GUNS.

MOMMY!
MOMMY!

OH, SANTA CLAUS.

WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

HELLO, MOTHER NATURE.

OH, I SENSE
SOME STORMY SEAS.

TELL MOTHER NATURE.
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU?

TWO OF MY ELVES,
JINGLE AND JANGLE,

HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD FROM
SINCE THEY TRIED

TO CROSS THE DIVIDE.

OH, BUT SURELY ONE OF
MY SONS MUST HAVE SEEN THEM.

I SPOKE TO THEM, BUT THEY
DIDN'T SEEM TO BE OF MUCH HELP.

SO THEY GAVE YOU
A HARD TIME, DID THEY?

I'M SURE THEY
DIDN'T MEAN TO.

OH, YES, THEY DID.

THEY'RE NASTY LITTLE BOYS,

BOTH OF THEM.

BUT DON'T WORRY.

I'LL GET YOU THE SKINNY.

OH, YOO HOO...

I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING.

AND I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING.

DO NOT LIE TO MOTHER NATURE.

IT MAKES HER EVER SO SOUR.

I VAGUELY REMEMBER
SEEING SOMETHING.

I VAGUELY REMEMBER
YOU SHOOTING AT THEM.

THAT IS A LIE.

HEAT MISER!

WELL, UH, YOUR ELVES
WERE OFF COURSE.

WE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR COLLATERAL DAMAGE

WHEN WE ARE FIGHTING.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

TELL SANTA WHAT YOU KNOW!

W-WELL, WE DID
FIND THIS.

THANK YOU.

SOUTH TOWN.

OH, THAT'S A RELIEF.

MOTHER NATURE, I CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

JINGLE AND JANGLE,
THEY MEAN WELL,

BUT, WELL,
THEY'RE LIKE CHILDREN.

I KNOW ALL ABOUT
IDIOT CHILDREN.

Sparky: MOTHER NATURE.

I THINK I'M DYING.
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

IT IS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

THE NAME'S SPARKY
THE ELF.

OH. YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
BOW WHEN THEY MEET

MOTHER NATURE.


I HAVE
A HER-HERNIATED DISK.

OHH.

DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY.
I'M FINE.

OH, GOOD.

AND AS FOR YOU TWO BOYS...

I HAVE SOME MANURE
THAT NEEDS MANIPULATING.

SO UNLESS YOU TWO BOYS
WANT THE JOB,

BEHAVE!


YES, MOMMY.
YES, MOMMY.

GOOD LUCK ON YOUR
ELF QUEST, SANTA.

And Merry Christmas.

I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO PLAY FAVORITES,

BUT IT IS MY MOST
CHERISHED SEASON.

I KNEW MOTHER ALWAYS
LIKED YOU BEST.

I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT!

I KNEW IT!
ROUND 3.

[BELL RINGS]

LET'S GO.
YOU GO.

I'M GONNA SUMMON
A SLEIGH

BACK TO
THE NORTH POLE.

I GOT TOYS
TO MANUFACTURE.

WHAT TOYS?

THERE ISN'T GONNA BE
A CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR.

YOU WANT TO HAVE
TO DEAL WITH A BUNCH

OF OUT-OF-WORK ELVES?

I GOT TO GIVE THEM
SOMETHING TO DO.

I HATE MY SERVICE!

DOES ANYONE HAVE
A CELL PHONE

THAT WORKS AROUND HERE?

THANKS. AAH!

AAH!


Sparky: YAAAH!

[DOGS BARKING]


VIXEN?

VIXEN.

WELL, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO

WHEN WE GET HER
OUT OF HERE?

IGGY STILL DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS.

IT AIN'T LIKE WE GOT
A SLEIGH TO GET HER

HOME ANYWAY.

[BELLS JINGLE]


DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, GIRL.

WE'RE GONNA GET
YOU OUTTA HERE!

SHH! THEY'LL PUT US
IN THE CAGE, TOO.

I'M SURE YOUR DAD WILL BE
HOME ANY MINUTE, HONEY.

YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY
THINGS GET FOR HIM

BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS.

MOM?
YES, IGGY.

HOW OLD WAS I
WHEN I STOPPED

BELIEVING
IN SANTA CLAUS?

I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD STOPPED BELIEVING.

YEAH.

ISN'T SANTA CLAUS
JUST FOR KIDS?

MAYBE.

BUT KIDS COME IN ALL AGES.

DO YOU BELIEVE
IN SANTA CLAUS?

I THINK I DO.

IN MY OWN WAY.

BUT I KNOW THAT YOU
AND DAD PUT THE GIFTS

UNDER THE CHRISTMAS
TREE. RIGHT?

WELL, THERE ARE LOTS
OF GIFTS THAT WE RECEIVE

IN THIS WORLD

THAT DON'T SHOW UP
UNDER A TREE.

[DOOR CLOSES]

WHO KNOWS
WHERE THEY COME FROM?

HEY, IGSTER.

HEY, DAD.

HI.
HI, HONEY.

SORRY, BUT I'M JUST
HOME FOR A SEC.

I GOT TO MEET THE DEVELOPERS
AND THEIR PARTNERS

FOR A DRINK.

DAD, YOU KNOW TOMORROW
IS THE FESTIVAL.

WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT
TO LEAVE IN THE MORNING?

WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK
TO DO ON THE MAYOR'S BOOTH--

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

I GOT A BIG MEETING
TOMORROW MORNING.

SO WHY DON'T I JUST
RENDEZVOUS WITH YOU LATER?

I GOT A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE TOMORROW,

AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S READY.

SO I PROMISE I WILL JOIN YOU
JUST AS SOON AS I CAN.

OK, SON?

SURE.

AFTER ALL, I'M NOT
JUST YOUR DAD...

YOU'RE THE MAYOR, TOO.

THAT'S MY BOY.

I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO MAKE THIS FESTIVAL

A BIG SUCCESS.

CAN I BE EXCUSED?

OF COURSE, HONEY.

DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
WE HAVE PLANS FOR TONIGHT?

NOPE. WHAT PLANS?

THE SAME PLANS
WE HAD LAST NIGHT

AND THE NIGHT
BEFORE THAT.

WE'VE GOT A CHRISTMAS TREE
TO DECORATE, REMEMBER?

OH. THAT.

YES, THAT.

AND A FAMILY WHO WANTS
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU,

EVEN WHEN THE CAMERAS
AREN'T ROLLING.

I'M SORRY, HONEY.

I'LL JUST GET HOME
AS SOON AS I CAN.

YOU DO THAT.

AND TRY TO REMEMBER:

YOU'RE NOT JUST
THE MAYOR.

YOU'RE A DAD, TOO.

I BLAME TELEVISION.

AREN'T WE HURTING
ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU

BLAMING TELEVISION?

AND SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS
AND VIDEO GAMES

WHERE YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
AND DO ANYTHING.

NOW YOU LOST ME.

RIGHT. NOW I'VE
LOST YOU.

I'M TALKING ABOUT IGGY.

I'M TALKING ABOUT
HOW ALL OUR ELF MAGIC

DOESN'T SEEM MAGICAL
TO HIM AT ALL.

IT'S LIKE HE THINKS
IT'S SOME BIG SPECIAL EFFECT.

IGGY'S PROBLEM IS
HE THINKS TOO MUCH.

HE NEEDS TO BE
MORE LIKE ME.

YEAH. NOT THINK AT ALL.

NO, JUST STOP PUTTING
EVERYTHING THROUGH

A SMART KID, MAYOR'S SON
BLEND-A-BRAIN.

DON'T THINK,
JUST LOOK, JUST SEE.

YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE
THE HEAT, BUT I THINK

YOU'RE STARTING
TO MAKE SENSE.

[DOORBELL CHIMES]

I'LL GET IT.

Jingle: NICE HOUSE.

WHAT KIND OF
TV SET YOU GOT?

WHO IS IT, IGGY?

JUST MY FRIENDS.

FRIENDS.

I LIKE THAT. FRIENDS.

HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

WE'RE ELVES.

AND WE NEED YOUR HELP.


WELL, YOU'VE GOT
A REINDEER.

I'LL GIVE YOU
THAT MUCH.

SO HOW DO
WE GET HER OUT?

DYNAMITE, MAN.
DYNAMITE.

I'VE SEEN THIS OLD EPISODE
OF "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE."

THEY HAD THIS
AUSTRALIAN STRONGMAN.

HE CAME AROUND
THE CORNER--

LOOK. THE ANIMAL
CONTROL SUPERVISOR'S

A REAL JERK.

I OUGHT TO KNOW.
MY DAD'S HIS BOSS.

HE'S NOT GOING TO
RELEASE THE REINDEER

TO YOU UNLESS YOU CAN
PROVE OWNERSHIP.

I CAN SHOW HIM THE SCARS
WHERE VIXEN KICKED ME.

I GUESS I COULD
TALK TO MY DAD.

COME ON, IGGY.
YOU GOT TO HELP US, MAN.

SHE'S DYING IN THERE.


OK.

THEN LEAVE IT UP TO ME.

PEOPLE TELL ME
I INHERITED

MY DAD'S SILVER TONGUE.

COOL. LET ME SEE.

IT'S JUST
AN EXPRESSION.

KEEP YOUR MUTT
ON A LEASH.

I'M TIRED OF
PICKING HIM UP.

WELL!

[DOG BARKS]

HOW'S IT GOING?

WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

WELL, MOST PEOPLE
KNOW ME AS IGGY.

BUT MY FATHER,
THE MAYOR,

LIKES TO CALL ME
IGSTER.

YOU KNOW HOW DADS ARE.

WELL, YOU'RE
IGGY THISTLEWHITE,

THE MAYOR'S SON.

WAS I BORN IN A BARN?
WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

DRINKING
ON THE JOB, EH?

NOT GOOD, HUH?

HMM...


YOU KNOW I COULD USE
RIGHT NOW?

HMM.

A REINDEER.

A REINDEER?
YEP.

WE NEED ONE FOR
THE FESTIVAL

TOMORROW.

I HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

REALLY?

THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

THERE'S JUST THIS
SMALL PROBLEM.

SEE, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PAPERWORK

OR MONEY TO PAY
THE FINE.

AW, WHAT THE HECK?

WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR
IF NOT TO HELP EACH OTHER?

YOU WANT THE CRITTER,
TAKE HIM.

LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR PAPERWORK.

THAT'S MY MOTTO.

WHOA.

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

MAN, I CAN'T
TAKE IT NO MORE.

THAT'S MY DOG
IN THERE, MAN.

VIXEN!

IT'S A DEER
BUT IT'S MY DAWG.

WE SAID WE'D LET
IGGY TAKE CARE OF IT.

JINGLE...

STOP!

GOT TO GET A BETTER
WAY TO COMMUNICATE.

YOU'VE BEEN DOING
THAT FOR 3,000 YEARS.

STOP!

IGGY, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

HOW'D YOU DO IT?

ALL IT TAKES IS
THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE.

BUT WHEN THAT GUY
FINDS OUT HE'S NOT

REALLY INVITED
TO CHRISTMAS DINNER--

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'LL ALL BE WORTH IT.

THE ONLY THING THAT WILL
MAKE IT WORTH IT

IS IF VIXEN CAN...

FLY.

Jingle: HATE TO SAY
I TOLD YOU SO.

WHOA!

Jangle: IGGY, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU GOT VIXEN OUT.

YEAH. WHEN YOUR DAD'S
THE MAYOR, IT'S EASY.

ARE YOU SURE
IT'S GONNA BE OK?

YEAH.
COME ON, VIXEN.

BUT WE GOT TO BE QUIET.

Come on.

[BELLS JINGLE]

She's gonna be
too loud.

Can't she just
float up the stairs?

Dad: IGGY,
IS THAT YOU?

Jangle: We're
going to jail.

We're going to jail.

Fly, Vixen, fly.

WHAT'S ALL THE RACKET?

SORRY, DAD.

I TRIPPED GOING
UP THE STAIRS.

OK, WELL, IT'S ABOUT
BEDTIME, SON.

SO...SO...WHEW.

OH. WHOO, BOY.
YOU NEED A SHOWER,

IGGY, NO OFFENSE.

DID YOU EAT SOMETHING?

WHEW! ROTTEN.

NIGHT, DAD.

[VIXEN GROWLS]

DID YOU JUST
GROWL AT ME?

YOU'RE RIGHT.

I SMELL LIKE
A WILD ANIMAL.

GRR!

RAAR. RAAR.

RRR.


IT'S PRETTY COOL

HAVING A REINDEER
IN MY ROOM, BUT...

IS SHE HOUSE BROKEN?

OH, SHE CAN BREAK
ANY HOUSE YOU WANT HER TO.

MAYBE THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

UM, SHE'LL BE
ALL RIGHT.

SHE JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE

AIR CONDITIONING.
SHE'LL BE OK

ONCE WE GET HER BACK
TO THE NORTH POLE.


SO YOUR DAD SEEMS LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY.

HE'S THE BEST.

PROBLEM IS...

HIS JOB KEEPS HIM
SO BUSY,

HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH
TIME FOR MY MOM OR ME.

BUT WHEN HE'S NOT
WORKING,

HE'S A GREAT DAD.

LAST WINTER HE TOOK ME
UP TO THE MOUNTAINS.

WE GOT CAUGHT
IN A BLIZZARD.

YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MUCH SNOW!

THE ROADS ARE CLOSED.

THE POWER WENT OUT.

EVEN THE PHONES
STOPPED WORKING.

MY DAD COULDN'T WORK,

AND THERE WAS
NOTHING TO DO.

SO WE BUILT A FIRE

AND JUST SPENT SOME TIME
TOGETHER FOR 3 DAYS.

THERE ARE VERY FEW
PROBLEMS SNOW CAN'T FIX.

IT WAS THE BEST TIME
I EVER HAD.

REALLY, FELLA,

IF YOU'RE GONNA
WEAR THE SUIT,

TRY AND TAKE
SOME PRIDE IN IT.

BUTTON THOSE BUTTONS.
TUCK IN THAT SHIRT.

STRAIGHTEN
THOSE LAPELS.

I'M NOT ON DUTY YET.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

THIS IS MY CORNER.

OH, WOW.

NOW, THAT'S A GREAT
BELT BUCKLE.

I'LL GIVE YOU 5 BUCKS
FOR IT.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

THIS BELT IS OVER
300 YEARS OLD.

THE GOLD FOR THE BUCKLE
WAS MINED AT THE NORTH POLE.

OK. HOW ABOUT 10?

LOOK, I'M TRYING TO FIND
MY ELVES AND MY REINDEER.

I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE SEEN 'EM, HAVE YOU?

HEH. NO.

BUT IF YOU WAIT TILL
I FINISH MY BOTTLE...

NO TIME FOR THAT.

UH-OH. THE MAN.

HEY. I'M THE MAN.

HOW ARE COLLECTIONS
GOING, SANTA?

I JUST GOT HERE.

I'M LOOKING FOR
MY REINDEER.

THAT BEAST
BELONGS TO YOU?

HE'S LOCKED DOWN AT
THE ANIMAL CONTROL SHELTER.

IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU'LL
PAY THE FINE AND CLAIM HIM.

WITH PLEASURE.

AND BOTH OF YOU
GET OUT OF MY TOWN.

FAR, FAR OUT.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
SANTY CLAUS?

I THINK YOU'VE GOT
MY REINDEER.

HMM. NO, I DON'T.

ARE YOU SURE?

ABOUT YEA HIGH.

ANSWERS TO THE NAME
OF VIXEN.

WELL, YOU'RE TOO LATE,
'CAUSE SOMEONE

ALREADY GOT HER.

WHO?

WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

I DO.

OK.

IT WAS THE MAYOR'S KID.
IGGY THISTLEWHITE.

I KNOW IGGY THISTLEWHITE.

I'M SURE YOU DO.

SURE, I DO.

I KNOW LOTS OF KIDS,
MILLIONS OF 'EM.

YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND HIM,

DO YOU?

AT THE CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL,
AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

YOU MORON.

I REMEMBER YOU
FROM WHEN YOU WERE

A LITTLE BOY.

YOU NEVER MADE MY LIST.

YEAH? WELL, I'M STILL
WAITING FOR THAT BB GUN, SANTA!

YOU'D SHOOT
YOUR EYE OUT.

OUCH!

HA HA HA HA!

HERE, YOU WANT THIS
TEDDY BEAR?

YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT ONE.

THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.


Man: HEY, TYLER.
COME OVER HERE, MAN.


I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAD.

WHERE?

OK.

Jingle: I'M GETTING
WORRIED ABOUT IGGY.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

EVERYTHING'S COMING
TOGETHER JUST FINE.

HE'S GOT TO GET TOGETHER
WITH HIS DAD FIRST.

YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
FIX THE WORLD

UNTIL YOU FIX
YOURSELF.

AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
VIXEN?

ARE YOU GUYS GOOD
AT CONSTRUCTION?

'CAUSE I COULD REALLY

USE SOME HELP
FINISHING THIS.

CONSTRUCTION?
THAT'S WORK, HUH?

YEAH!

ALL RIGHT!

YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.

[VIXEN GROWLS]

WHOA, GIRL, WHAT IS IT?

I THINK SHE HEARS
SOMETHING.

WHOA, VIXEN.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

COME BACK HERE, GIRL.

Boy: REINDEER!


I STILL LOVE YOU.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOUR MOTHER.

SANTA!
SANTA!

DON'T LISTEN TO ELVES,
BECAUSE THEY WILL

GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

JINGLE...

JANGLE, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

I CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.
WHAT GOT INTO YOU TWO,

TAKING OFF WITHOUT
TELLING ANYONE?

MRS. CLAUS IS
BESIDE HERSELF.

I OUGHT TO PUT YOU
BACK ON THE TOY LINE.

WE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BOTHERED.

NOW, COME ON.

LET'S GET YOU
AND VIXEN HOME.

WAIT, SANTA.

THERE'S SOMEONE
WE NEED YOU TO MEET.

IGGY THISTLEWHITE.

THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

I'M THE MAN.
YEAH.

â™ª ALL HAIL
THE JOLLY FAT MAN â™ª

â™ª ALL THE KIDS ARE
SO EXCITED TO SEE SANTA â™ª

â™ª THE HOPE, THE SNOW,
THE MISTLETOE â™ª

â™ª THE CHRISTMAS TREE
WITH THE LIGHTS JUST SO â™ª

â™ª IT'S GOT TO BE
THE FAVORITE TIME OF YEAR â™ª

â™ª ALL HAIL THE JOLLY FAT MAN â™ª

â™ª ALL THE KIDS ARE
SO EXCITED TO SEE SANTA â™ª

â™ª THE HOPE, THE SNOW,
THE MISTLETOE â™ª

â™ª THE CHRISTMAS TREE
WITH THE LIGHTS JUST SO... â™ª

OH, MA'AM. I'M NOT...

I ALWAYS LIKED
A MAN IN UNIFORM.

AND YOU MAKE SURE
THAT MONEY

GETS TO SOMEONE
WHO NEEDS IT.

YESSUM.

THANK YOU.

HERE.

YOU NEED THAT A LOT
MORE THAN I DO.

WHAT'S YOUR CHARITY?

A HOMELESS SHELTER.

I'M LIVING THERE TILL
THEY FINISH RENOVATING

MY MANSION.

HERE.

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE
KIDS FROM THE SHELTER

CAN'T WAIT FOR
YOUR VISIT TONIGHT.

Jingle: IGGY!

SANTA, THIS IS OUR FRIEND
IGGY THISTLEWHITE.

PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, IGGY.

YOU'VE GROWN.

IT HAPPENS.

SO IT DOES.

ARE YOU REALLY
SANTA CLAUS?

I MEAN, THE REAL
SANTA CLAUS?

I'M AFRAID I AM.

WOW.

IS IT TRUE THAT THIS
CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL

WAS YOUR IDEA?

I GUESS SO.

MY DAD'S THE MAYOR
OF SOUTH TOWN.

HE HELPED ME
PUT IT TOGETHER.

LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
DONE QUITE A JOB.

IT ISN'T OFFICIALLY
OPEN TILL LATER,

BUT YOU CAN LOOK AROUND
IF YOU LIKE.

IGGY, DID YOU
BUILD THIS?

WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM MY FRIENDS.

MOM, THIS IS
JINGLE AND JANGLE.

AND THIS IS SANTA CLAUS,

THE REAL ONE.

THE REAL ONE?
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS

WANTED TO MEET THE
REAL SANTA CLAUS.

AND I'VE GOT A BONE
TO PICK WITH YOU.

WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD,

I SPECIFICALLY ASKED
FOR A BOYS' BIKE.

AND YOU BOUGHT ME
A GIRLS'.

I WAS A BIT OF
A TOMBOY IN THOSE DAYS.

YOU'RE RACHEL STEVENS,
AREN'T YOU?

YES. THAT'S
MY MAIDEN NAME.

AS I RECALL, YOU WERE
QUITE SMALL AT THAT AGE,

AND A BOYS' BIKE WOULD HAVE
BEEN UNSAFE FOR YOU TO RIDE.

SO, I BOUGHT YOU THAT
DARK BLUE SCHWINN

WITH THE GREEN
HANDLEBAR TASSELS

BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE
THE COLORS MIGHT MAKE YOU HAPPY.

HOW DID YOU...?

MOM, DID YOU TALK TO DAD?

DO YOU KNOW
WHEN HE'S COMING?

WHAT, IGGY?

I SAID, HAVE YOU
TALKED TO DAD?

I NEED HIM HERE TO MAN
THE BOOTH WITH ME.

I'M AFRAID I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HIM

THIS MORNING, HONEY,
BUT I KNOW HE WAS

PLANNING ON JOINING
YOU LATER.

I'M SURE HE'LL BE HERE

BEFORE THE FESTIVAL
BEGINS.

HEY, WHAT AM I--
CHOP SUEY?

YOU AND I ARE GONNA
RAISE SOME SERIOUS MONEY

FOR THAT SOUTH TOWN
ENDOWMENT, OK?

OK.

OK. I'M GONNA GO GET
THE REST OF THE PIES.

I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE
SHORTLY.

IGGY...

YES, MOM?

YOU KNOW THAT YOUR DAD
IS VERY PROUD OF YOU.

YOU OK, IGGY?

I'VE ALWAYS
LOVED CHRISTMAS,

BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
MY MOM AND DAD AND I

WOULD ALWAYS
BE TOGETHER.

BUT, AS MY DAD BECAME
MORE IMPORTANT,

HE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE
TIME FOR CHRISTMAS ANYMORE.

HE EVEN WORKS ON CHRISTMAS
DAY SOMETIMES.

YOU KNOW, IGGY.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

SOMETIMES EVEN I FORGET
HOW IMPORTANT CHRISTMAS

IS TO PEOPLE.

REALLY?

YEP.

I USED TO THINK
I WAS TOO OLD

TO BELIEVE IN
SANTA CLAUS.

NOW I THINK I'M TOO OLD
NOT TO BELIEVE.

IGGY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
ME ANYTHING, SANTA.

OH, I OWE YOU FOR TAKING
CARE OF MY ELVES.

BIG TIME.

NOW, WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?

I'D LIKE YOU TO MAKE IT
SNOW HERE IN SOUTH TOWN.

SNOW?

NOT JUST SNOW,

BUT TONS OF SNOW.

I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

IT'S NOT YOUR USUAL
CHRISTMAS WISH,

BUT IT CAME FROM
THE HEART.

I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO, IGGY.


YAH!

HO HO HO HO HO!

WELL, WELL, WELL.
IF IT ISN'T SANTY CLAUS?

SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF
DOING ANOTHER COMMERCIAL

FOR MY BROTHER?

YOU KNOW I NEVER TAKE

SIDES BETWEEN YOU
AND SNOW MISER.

OH, COME ON.

TRAIPSING AROUND
IN THAT SLEIGH OF YOURS,

STIRRING UP COLD
WINTER BREEZES,

MAKING EVERYBODY THINK
FONDLY OF ICE HOCKEY

AND SNOW BALL FIGHTS
AND SLEIGH RIDES.

I CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S
TOTALLY UNINTENTIONAL.

WHY CAN'T YOU SING
THE PRAISES OF SUNSTROKE

AND HEAT PROSTRATION?

I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

MEANWHILE, I CAME
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD.

NOBODY EVER DOES
ANYTHING FOR ME.

YOU ALL LIKE MY BROTHER
BETTER ANYWAYS.

NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

MOST OF THE TIME I CAN'T
STAND EITHER OF YOU.

BUT LISTEN,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

ALL RIGHT.
I'M LISTENING.

I NEED YOU TO TURN THE
HEAT DOWN IN SOUTH TOWN

SO YOUR BROTHER CAN
MAKE IT SNOW THERE.

WHAT?!

SNOW IN THE DEEP SOUTH?

NEVER!

HAVEN'T THE MORTALS MESSED
WITH THE WEATHER ENOUGH?

WHY SHOULD I HELP THEM
SCREW IT UP MORE?

I'LL MAKE IT WORTH
YOUR WHILE.

MMM...

REMEMBER A CHRISTMAS
WISH YOU MADE

WHEN YOU WERE
A LITTLE KID

AND I WOULDN'T
GIVE IT TO YOU?

THE FLAME THROWER?

NO. NOT THE FLAME THROWER.

THE LITTLE ISOTOPE
NUCLEAR REACTOR KIT?

NO, NO, NO, NO.
THINK NORTH POLE.

FOR ONE WHOLE DAY

THE WEATHER IN
THE NORTH POLE

BELONGS TO ME.

A SLIMY, STANKIN',
SMELLY SUMMER'S DAY.

ELVES SLATHERED
IN SUNBLOCK.

OF COURSE, WE NEED
SNOW MISER'S PERMISSION.

WHY DON'T WE GIVE
THAT TOOTY FRUITY

SNOW CONE A BUZZ
ON MY HOTLINE,

SEE WHAT HE SAYS?

SNOW MISER.

SANTA CLAUS HERE.

HI, SANTA.

HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT
WITH THE HOT HEAD?

HEY, I HEARD THAT,
YOU SNOWBALL.

MIND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE,
HOT CAKES.

MOTHER WARNED YOU ABOUT
THE LOW BOILING POINT OF YOURS.

YOU THINK YOU SO HOT,

JUST 'CAUSE MAMA
LIKE YOU BEST.

ENOUGH ALREADY!

SNOW MISER, YOUR BROTHER'S
AGREED TO TURN DOWN

THE HEAT AT SOUTH TOWN
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT SNOW THERE.

WHAT?

OF COURSE, THERE'D BE
A SMALL CONCESSION.

WHAT DID THAT FLAMING FOOL
WANT THIS TIME--THE NORTH POLE?


AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT HAPPENS TO BE

THE SMALL CONCESSION
I ASKED FOR.

WHAT?!

YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU
HE WOULDN'T COOPERATE.

COOPERATE?

THE VERY THOUGHT MAKES
THE BLOOD RUN COLD IN MY VEINS.

YEAH, WELL,
IT'S ENOUGH

TO BOIL
MY BRAIN CELLS.

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!
YOU TWO BEHAVE YOURSELVES

OR I'M GONNA CALL
YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW!

OOH!

NO. NOT MOMMY.

ALL RIGHT, THEN.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

Sparky: GIVE ME SOME ROOM.
GIVE ME SOME ROOM!

THIS IS GONNA BE
A CHRISTMAS EVE TO REMEMBER.

THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA.

ONE BIG STEP FOR MANKIND.

THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.

NOTHING BETTER GO WRONG
OR HEADS WILL ROLL!

SPARKY, HAVE YOU
SEEN SANTA?

WHAT THE HECK IS
GOING ON HERE?

HALLOWEEN.

EARLY.

IT'S EXTREME SANTA.
I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

OW!

AND I TOLD YOU THAT
SANTA IS FLYING TONIGHT.

HE IS?
OH. I'M SORRY.

MY BAD.

OH, WAIT.
I JUST REMEMBERED.

HE'S NOT HERE.

HE'S FISHING FOR ELVES.

AND THAT MEANS THE CEO CAN
DECIDE WHO DELIVERS THE TOYS

TO ALL THE GOOD
LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS.

AND WAIT A SECOND HERE.
YEP. THAT WOULD BE MOI.

DO YOU WANT
TO BREAK HIS HEART?

ARE YOU CRAZY?

THAT IS THE LAST THING
I EVER WANT TO DO.

I JUST WANT THERE
TO BE A CHRISTMAS.

HE HAD HIS CHANCE.
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO MY LAWYER ABOUT IT,

I'M SURE HE CAN
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU!

HE'S RIGHT, MRS. CLAUS.

IN THE ABSENCE OF
SANTA CLAUS,

SPARKY IS LEGALLY ENTITLED
TO TAKE OVER.

NOW, I'LL HAVE A COPY
OF "THE NORTH POLE PROTOCOLS

AND CLAUSIAN CONTRACTUAL
COVENANTS" HIGHLIGHTED

AND SENT OVER TO YOU.

CHRISTMAS--YAAH!


WHERE ARE YOU,
YOU OLD GOAT?

WE NEED YOU.

PLEASE COME HOME.

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

SAVE CHRISTMAS!

I AM SO MOVED RIGHT NOW.

THEY'RE GATHERING TO WISH ME
GOOD LUCK AND GODSPEED.

WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT LET ME CRY, OK?

I DO NOT WANT
TO GET CROW'S FEET.

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

I LOVE THESE ELVES.

YEAH, BUT SPARKY, LOOK.

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

SAVE CHRISTMAS!
SAVE CHRISTMAS!

SAVE CHRISTMAS!

THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ALL
SO VERY MUCH.

YOU HAVE ALL MADE ME
SO VERY HAPPY.

I WISH I COULD STAY
AND BASK IN MY GLORY.

BUT IT'S TIME
TO MAKE HISTORY.

IS MY SLEIGH READY?

IT IS NOT!

THEN GET IT READY. NOW!

THIS IS SO
NOT HAPPENING.

THERE'LL BE
A SLEIGH READY.

THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

FOR SANTA CLAUS!


OH!

OH, REALLY?

OH, IS THAT HOW IT IS?

YEAH!
YEAH!

ALL RIGHT. FINE!

I WAS GONNA SAVE THE NEWS
UNTIL AFTER NEW YEARS,

BUT SANTA CO. IS DOWNSIZING.

AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HELP ME
GET MY SLEIGH READY,

IS FINISHED!

FINISHED!

LOOK! THE SUN WILL BE
SETTING SOON.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO SANTA!

THAT'S RIGHT!
YOU HEARD ME.

HE'S DESERTED US.
HA HA!

HAH! HAH!

OH, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF CHILDREN

WHO ARE WAITING
FOR THEIR PRESENTS...

YOU WANT TO BREAK
THEIR LITTLE HEARTS?

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?



THANK YOU.
YOU'RE ALL FORGIVEN.

IT'S SANTA CLAUS!

WELL, WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR--EASTER?

LET'S GET THAT SLEIGH LOADED;
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

THANKS.

WHAT IS THIS?

WHAT ARE YOU DRESSED UP
FOR, SPARKY?

AND WHAT'S WITH
THE LITTLE BEARD?

SPARKY WAS MY SLAVE NAME.
I'M EXTREME SANTA NOW.


I'M SORRY.

HA HA HA!

I JUST WANTED TO BE
A BIG MAN FOR ONCE.



I WANT PEOPLE TO
RESPECT ME AND FEAR ME.

I NEVER GET TO BE
THE BOSS. OW!

WOW.

I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE SPARKY CRY.

EVEN MY DAD SAID
I WAS LITTLE.

WELL, AS DR. LAURA
WOULD SAY,

"SPARKY'S GOT
A DEEP-ROOTED

"FATHER COMPLEX
THAT HE'S PROJECTING

"ON SANTA CLAUS.

"MAYBE NOW HE'LL COME
TO GRIPS WITH HIS

"SUPPRESSED ANGER AND
LEARN TO FORGIVE SANTA

AND HIMSELF."

THANK YOU.

NO. THANK TELEVISION.

â™ª 'TIS THE SEASON
TO BE JOLLY â™ª

â™ª FA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LAâ™ª

â™ª DON WE NOW OUR GAY APPAREL â™ª

â™ª FA LA LA LA LA

â™ª FA LA LA LA LA... â™ª

HEY! HEY!

YOU GOT ICE SHAVINGS
IN MY CHILI.

I'LL KINDLY ASK YOU
TO KEEP YOUR MACHINE

IN GOOD WORKING ORDER.

I'M REFILLING THE MACHINE.
IT'S NOT EVEN TURNED ON.

WELL, WHERE'S THIS
ICE COMING FROM?

I DON'T KNOW.

MAYBE IT'S BLUE ICE
FROM SOME LEAKY

AIRPLANE LAVATORY.

JUST TASTES LIKE ICE.

WHOA.

Man on radio: THE SNOW STORM
HAD COME LITERALLY

OUT OF THE BLUE.

THE FORECAST CALLED FOR
HIGHS IN THE LOW 80s

AND NO CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION.

INSTEAD, WE HAVE WHAT APPEARS
TO BE THE ONLY SNOWFALL

IN THESE PARTS
SINCE THE ICE AGE.

COME ON. I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

TRAFFIC HAS SLOWED
TO A CRAWL,

AS DRIVERS TRY TO COPE
WITH THE NEW EXPERIENCE

OF DRIVING IN THE SNOW.

I'M WALKING.

["WE WISH YOU A MERRY
CHRISTMAS" PLAYING OVER P.A.]

WHERE IS HE?

THERE HE IS.

YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

HEY.
YOU'RE LATE.

DAD.
I KNOW.

WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

JUST A MINUTE. HEY!

WE NEED YOU UPSTAGE
FOR THE LIGHTING.

DAD, THE WHOLE TOWN'S
PLAYING IN THE SNOW.

IT'S INCREDIBLE!

I KNOW. I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

REMINDS ME OF OUR
TRIP TO THE MOUNTAINS.

HEY, DAD. I STARTED
BUILDING A SNOWMAN

OVER BY OUR BOOTH.

YOU WANT TO COME SEE IT?

YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

THEN COME ON!

...TO THE MAN PLAYING
SANTA TO THE CITY--

MAYOR THISTLEWHITE.

FOR TWO TERMS,
THIS MAN HAS LED...

I HAVE TO DO THIS
FIRST, IGGY, OK?

CAN IT JUST WAIT
TILL I FINISH MY SPEECH?

I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
I'M NOT JUST YOUR DAD...

HE HAS GRACIOUSLY
WELCOMED US...

I GIVE YOU...

THE HONORABLE
MAYOR THISTLEWHITE.


MR. MAYOR!
MR. MAYOR!

COME ON, MAYOR.

AHEM. HI.


YOU KNOW, I THINK SOMEONE
ONCE ASKED ME

WHEN I WOULD STOP
RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

AND I SAID, "WHEN
IT SNOWS IN SOUTH TOWN."


OOPS.

Woman: OH, YEAH.

OUR TOWN'S HISTORY BEGAN
WHEN IT WAS BUILT IN 1875.

NOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO WRITE A NEW CHAPTER

IN OUR TOWN'S HISTORY.

THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE TONIGHT.

TO ANNOUNCE A NEW DEVELOPMENT
RIGHT HERE,

RIGHT IN THE HEART
OF SOUTH TOWN.

NEW STORES.

JOBS.

REVITALIZATION.

THAT'S WHAT I WAS
GOING TO ANNOUNCE.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

MAYBE SOUTH TOWN DOESN'T
NEED TO BE TORN DOWN

AND TURNED INTO
A MEGA MALL.

MAYBE ALL SOUTH TOWN NEEDS

IS A NEW APPRECIATION
OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE.

SOMETIMES WE FORGET
EVERYTHING WE HAVE

AND WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

LET'S ALL REMEMBER
WHAT SOUTH TOWN LOOKS LIKE

COVERED IN SNOW!

I THINK THE MAYOR HAS CAUGHT
A LITTLE SNOW FEVER.

CAN YOU STICK TO
THE SPEECH AS WRITTEN,

MR. MAYOR?

I THINK THIS SPEECH IS OVER.

AND FOR THE REST OF THE HOLIDAYS
I AM NO LONGER THE MAYOR.

I'M JUST A DAD.

I AM GOING TO PLAY
WITH MY SON

AND BUILD A SNOWMAN
BY THAT PALM TREE OVER THERE.

SO, I GUESS THE ONLY THING
LEFT TO SAY IS

MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.

YOU'RE FINISHED,
THISTLEWHITE.

GOOD JOB. LET'S WORK
ON IT AGAIN LATER.

I DON'T WORK
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

HEY!

OK. WHERE'S THAT SNOWMAN?

IT'S OVER HERE.
COME ON. COME ON.

EXCUSE ME.
COMING THROUGH.

LET'S GO.
GO, GO.

OK, JULIE,
WE'RE LIVE IN 3...

2...1...

SNOW.

IT'S ALREADY BEING CALLED
THE MIRACLE OF SOUTH TOWN.

MOST REMARKABLE IS THAT
SNOW'S ONLY FALLING HERE.

THERE'S NO REPORT OF SNOWFALL
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE REGION.

EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT
THEORY ABOUT WHERE

THE SNOWSTORM CAME FROM.

BUT THERE'S ONE THEORY
THAT WE LIKED

BETTER THAN THE REST.

IGGY...

COULD YOU TELL OUR
VIEWERS WHERE YOU THINK

THE SNOWSTORM CAME FROM?

I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

IT WAS A GIFT
FROM SANTA CLAUS.

WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

I GUESS EVERYONE
IN SOUTH TOWN OWES

A BIG DEBT OF
GRATITUDE TO...

SANTA CLAUS.

â™ª OH, JINGLE BELLS...â™ª

SNOWBALL FIGHT!

WHOO!
HA HA!

â™ª ...ONE HORSE
OPEN SLEIGH, HEY! â™ª

SNOWBALL FIGHT!

DID YOU HEAR THAT, SANTA?

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NICE KID, THAT IGGY.

NOW, TURN THE TV OFF

AND HELP US GET READY
HERE, WILL YOU?

Clop: SLEIGH'S READY,
SANTA.

THANK YOU, CLOP.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING, WOMAN?

AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
YOU CAUSED US,

YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO LET YOU

GO ALONE, DO YOU?

I WOULD WELCOME
THE COMPANY, MRS. CLAUS.

THANK YOU, MR. CLAUS.

[BELLS JINGLING]

Iggy: GO.


NO LOSERS. NO...

VROOM!
OW!

HERE WE GO. AHH!

DA-BOOM!

YOU GOT...
OH!

YOU WON.
THAT'S GOOD.

THAT WAS GOOD, MAN.
COOL.

MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THANK YOU.

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA.

â™ª MAMACITA â™ª

â™ª Â¿DONDE ESTA SANTA CLAUS? â™ª

â™ª Â¿DONDE ESTA SANTA CLAUS? â™ª

85 DEGREES OUT HERE.

THIS REMINDS ME
OF SOUTH TOWN.

DID I EVER TELL YOU
I WENT TO SOUTH TOWN?

I KIND OF SAVED
CHRISTMAS.

OH.

OH, POOL BOY!

BRING FORTH
THE DRINKS.

YES. IN A MOMENT, SIR.


AHH...

YOU THINK WE CAN
CONVINCE

THE MISER BROTHERS TO DO
THIS EVERY YEAR?

YEAH. IF THEY DON'T
KILL EACH OTHER FIRST.

YOU KNOW, WE COULD
LIVE LIKE THIS EVERY DAY

IN MYTHOPOLIS.

IF YOU SO MUCH
AS MENTION

THAT PLACE AGAIN,

I AM PUSHING YOU
OVER THE DIVIDE.

I'M JUST TEASING,
MRS. CLAUS.

YOU'VE CONVINCED ME
THE WORLD STILL NEEDS

OLD SANTA.

AND IT ALWAYS WILL.

I PROMISE THERE'LL
NEVER AGAIN BE A YEAR

WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

I'M GONNA HOLD YOU
TO THAT.

MM-HMM.

â™ª WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

â™ª WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

â™ª WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

â™ª AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR â™ª
