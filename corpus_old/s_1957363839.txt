<i>- It is my high honor</i>

<i>and distinct privilege</i>

<i>to introduce to you</i>

the President-Elect
of the United States

of America, Donald Trump.

[cheers and applause]

crowd chanting: USA! USA! USA!

<i>- I pledge to every citizen</i>
<i>of our land</i>

<i>that I will be president</i>
<i>for all Americans.</i>

<i>And this is so important</i>
<i>to me.</i>

Middle America hates Mexis.
Who knew?

I did.

So bow, motherfuckers!

<i>- I'm reaching out to you</i>

<i>for your guidance</i>
<i>and your help...</i>

[sighs]

<i>- So that we can work together</i>

<i>and unify our great country.</i>

<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

RIP, nation of immigrants.


It sucks to be right.

Hey, don't hate the player.
Hate the game pool.

All I do is win, win, win.

Win. [laughing]

Psst.

<i>- ...tremendous potential.</i>

<i>I've gotten to know our</i>
<i>country so well.</i>

<i>Tremendous potential.</i>

<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>a beautiful thing.</i>

What's up?
How's everyone feeling?

Like an orange antichrist

murdered their
immigrant dreams.

[scoffs]

[laughs]
Don't worry.

I'll crack the whip
and make sure

they pull it together
for the 11:00.

Okay, but focus on
local elections.

And let the network
do the heavy lifting.

I will tell you how wonderful
you are.

Wonderful enough to be
promoted to executive producer?


Thank you, thank you,
thank you, caballeros!

What? Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Uh-huh. Pay up.

Here you go.
There's your money.

Give it to me.
Nope.

Give it to me!
Que no te darÃ©, chica.

How did you know, puta?

Because I'm jaded as hell.
Psh, yeah you are.

Okay. Let's get this thing
rolling, guys.

<i>[dramatic synth music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- Bienvenidos</i>
<i>a Noticiero Unimundo 45.</i>

<i>A las 11:00.</i>

[crowd chanting angrily]

Down with Trump!

all: Down with Trump!

Down with Trump!
Down with Trump!

[humming]

Let's go to Maria Alejandra,
please.

<i>- Nos acompaÃ±a el vocero</i>
<i>de latinos por Trump</i>

<i>del Sur de California.</i>

Ahora que ganÃ³ Trump.
Â¿CuÃ¡l serÃ¡ el prÃ³ximo paso?

Bueno,
la seguridad nacional

es un asunto muy importante

para nuestro
nuevo presidente.

O sea, que
necesitamos deportar

a los mojados inmediatamente.

Deport wetbacks immediately?
What the fuck?

<i>Maria Alejandra,</i>
<i>wrap it up now.</i>

Los ilegales

son una vergÃ¼enza
para nuestra comunidad.

crowd: Not my president!

Menos para mi abuelita,

que vino sin papeles,
porque no le quedÃ³ otra.

Cut to the reel.
It's not ready yet.

<i>- Lo escuchÃ³ aquÃ­ primero.</i>

Las deportaciones masivas
son inminentes.

She's repeating
that nonsense?

Maria Alejandra, uh,
repeat what I say.

Acaba de escuchar

informaciÃ³n no verified.

Your Spanish is so bad,

you sound like a Mexican Yoda.

CÃ¡llate, Darth Hater.

She took off her earpiece,
remember?

Reportando en vivo
desde el condado Orange,

MarÃ­a Alejandra de la Torre
Guadalupe Venegas Villaflor,

Noticias Unimundo 45.

Do you think our viewers will
actually believe this shit?

No sÃ©.

No sÃ©.

[phone chimes]

[sighs softly]

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

I know. You've warned us.

Si ese idiota gana,
me voy a la chingada.

Bueno, como dijo Zapata:

"Mejor morir de pie que vivir
de rodillas". Â¿Que no?

But you're not fighting.
You're running away.

Ah, pues tienes
un buen punto.

She's smart. [chuckles]

We go bye-bye, hm?

AdiÃ³s, USA.

[sighs] MamÃ¡, por favor,
listen to me.

Um...

Me van a dar una...

Promotion?

Â¿Te van a ascender?

Yes. Ah, uh...

Y con dinero, yo...

Yo, um, hire...

an immigration lawyer

and get you green cards.

Mi'ja, tal vez
deberÃ­as contratar

una maestra en espaÃ±ol
tambiÃ©n, Â¿verdad?

I don't need a Spanish
teacher, papÃ¡.

Mi espaÃ±ol is very bueno.

I no need no lawyer.

They don't like me? I go. Hm?

So instead of dealing
with an immigration lawyer,

you'd rather go back
to narcolandia?

Por lo menos,
los narcos de Sinaloa...

...speak the Spanish.

Oh, okay.

Uh, so then the drug dealers

can speak Spanish to you
as they shoot you.


No te rÃ­as.

MarÃ­a Alejandra de la Torre
Venegas Guadalupe Villaflor

dijo...

MarÃ­a Alejandra is clueless.

Ella no saber nada.

You should be listening to me.

Â¿De veras?

Ay, pues mira,
si tÃº sabes tanto,

Â¿por quÃ© no dices
tÃº las noticias, mm?

And then she said,
if I knew more than Ms. Mexico,

then why wasn't I on TV?

As if those light-skinned
egomaniacs

could tell their asses
from their mics

if it weren't for the likes
of people like me.

Oh. Oh, dang, that's--
that's messed up.

That's all you have to say?

Oh, I'm just getting
ready for work, you know.

[laughing] Okay.

I know you.
You're holding back.

What do you want me to say?

That I'm surprised that
your parents are leaving?

'Cause I'm--I'm kinda not.

Oh?
Yeah.

[sighs] Mexican people
don't know how to fight.

There.
Happy?

Is that what you were
looking for?

Is that what you wanted?
Oh, I'm sorry.

My people aren't
as woke as your people?

Why are you saying that like

you aren't a part
of the problem?

Wait, me?
Yes, you.

Did you forget our plan?

Infiltrate--
both: To renovate.

We're a local station.

And Dante hates those
kinds of stories.

See, you always
do what he says.

I swear, you're like one
promotion away

from being a full-fledged
sell-out.

Fuck you.

[scoffs] Fuck me?
Fuck Unamundo.

You been there, what,
like, six years

and they still got you
behind the scenes?

That's where I want to be.
Oh, yeah, sure.

And Spanish TV isn't like
mainstream TV.

The men can look like trolls,
but the mujeres?

They've got to look like
Malibu Barbie.

Not like extras
from "Apocalypto."

Well, most of your audience
looks like extras

from "Apocalypto,"
so it kinda works.

[sighs heavily]

So what you're saying is that

if my parents leave,
it's on me,

because I haven't done enough?

What I'm saying is,

empower Latinos
and fight the power, boo.

Not like that, okay.

Not that, don't do that.

[claps hands]

I have a journalism degree,

but my parents would
rather listen

to some right-wing
beauty queen than me.

It's not the end
of the mundo, mami.

All these years I've been
climbing the fucking ladder

to make my parents proud.

Now? [chuckles]

My mother's in Puerto Rico,
and I'm okay.

The only person that loves me
is 3,345 miles away.

But I'm okay.

The people on camera,

they have the power, but us,
we have no power.

Nada.

Luna, don't do it!

How could say there would be
mass deportations?

Why don't you learn how
to speak English already

and go work at Fox News?

Â¿CÃ³mo? They hire?

La gente necesita estar
preparada para lo peor.

Â¿SÃ­ entiendes eso, mamasita?

Prepared for the worst?

You don't even know what's
going to happen,

but what we do know is that
because of you,

some of our viewers
are self-deporting.

Bueno, me imagino que serÃ¡
mejor irse voluntariamente

de este paÃ­s a que te echen
a patadas como perro, Â¿no?

You know,

the only reason
you're on air

is because you speak
like a Mexican

and you look like a German.

[scoffs]

La Ãºnica razÃ³n por la cual
tÃº nunca en tu vida

vas a salir al aire,

aparte de tu pÃ©simo espaÃ±ol,
por supuesto,

es que al igual
que nuestros televidentes,

tÃº tienes un enorme complejo
de inferioridad.


ArrÃ©glate, mi amor.

<i>- One of my stories died.</i>

I'd like to use the extra time

to do a public service
announcement.

What's our competition
at 11:00?

Um, sleep.

A PSA that late
is like Ambien.

This one will keep them
tuned in. Trust me.

Fine. But keep it under 30.

And Luna, put it on
after the weather.

Um, sure.

Mantente seco
este fin de semana.

O sea, no lloverÃ¡.

Solo estarÃ¡s mojado
por el sudor.


<i>[soft dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- Luna, Â¿estÃ¡s lista?</i>

<i>Porque ya,</i>
<i>en tres, dos, uno.</i>

Um... [sighs]

Soy Luna grande

productora de noticias,
Unimundo 45.

Estoy aquÃ­ para adiÃ³s decir

a mis padres

que se van, ah, porque, um...

They're self-deporting.

<i>Mis padres van porque...</i>

<i>they listen to everything</i>

that MarÃ­a Alejandra
de la Torre

<i>Venegas...</i>

<i>Jesus, how many names</i>
<i>does she have?</i>

Unfounded, uh, reportaje

<i>mass deportation--</i>
<i>deportaciones.</i>

Maybe you should be ashamed
because

<i>we aren't rich enough to get</i>
<i>visas or because we don't--</i>

<i>- Paulo, cut it off</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

You want me to get Luna
off the air?

I thought she had
your permission.

<i>- Immediately.</i>

<i>- ...or our faces</i>
<i>are too fat for us</i>

<i>to belong in this country</i>
<i>or for me to belong on camera.</i>

Dante says cut to commercial.

<i>- So I know how you feel.</i>

That might take me a minute.

Or 12.

<i>I mean, olvida, right?</i>

<i>That we've probably been</i>
<i>in this country</i>

way longer than
la primera dama

uh, Melania, or, um,

americanos importantes, uh,

like Charlie Chaplin or...

el, uh, gobernador
Schwarzenegger.

They were undocumented too.

<i>Eran indocumentados.</i>

<i>Ah, and forget that we,</i>

<i>uh, like, raised their...</i>

<i>uh, escuincles</i>

<i>and make their avocado toast.</i>

Y pagamos taxes.

Fuck that.

This country is better
because we're in it.

El paÃ­s es mejor
con nosotros.

I mean, we've been on this land

long before those gabachos
took it from our ancestors.

California era de MÃ©xico,
seÃ±ores.

So don't give up.

<i>No se rinde.</i>

Sangre Maya tener.

You are Aztec warriors.

Stay and fight!

<i>Pelea por</i>
<i>tus civil rights!</i>

<i>Â¡Y viva la Raza, cabrones!</i>

<i>Â¡Viva la Raza, cabrones!</i>
