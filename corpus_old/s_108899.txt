Morgan:
EVERYTHING'S BIGGER IN AMERICA

,
WE'VE GOT THE BIGGEST CARS

THE BIGGEST HOUSES,

THE BIGGEST COMPANIES,

THE BIGGEST FOOD,

AND, FINALLY,
THE BIGGEST PEOPLE.

AMERICA HAS NOW BECOME
THE FATTEST NATION IN THE WORLD.

CONGRATULATIONS.

NEARLY 100 MILLION AMERICANS
ARE TODAY EITHER OVERWEIGHT

OR OBESE.

THAT'S MORE
THAN 60% OF ALL U.S. ADULTS.

SINCE 1980,

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OVERWEIGHT
AND OBESE AMERICANS HAS DOUBLED,

WITH TWICE AS MANY
OVERWEIGHT CHILDREN

AND THREE TIMES AS MANY
OVERWEIGHT ADOLESCENTS.

?
THE FATTEST STATE IN AMERICA

MISSISSIPPI -- WHERE ONE
IN FOUR PEOPLE ARE OBESE.

,
I GREW UP IN WEST VIRGINIA

CURRENTLY THE THIRD-FATTES
T STATE IN AMERICA.

WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, MY MOTHER
COOKED DINNER EVERY SINGLE DAY.

ALMOST ALL MY MEMORIES OF HE
R ARE IN THE KITCHEN.

AND WE NEVER ATE OUT,

ONLY ON THOSE FEW, RARE
SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

TODAY, FAMILIES DO IT
ALL THE TIME,

AND THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT --
NOT ONLY WITH THEIR WALLETS,

BUT WITH THEIR WAISTLINES.

OBESITY IS NOW
SECOND ONLY TO SMOKING

AS A MAJOR CAUSE
OF PREVENTABLE DEATH IN AMERICA,

WITH MORE
THAN 400,000 DEATHS PER YEAR

ASSOCIATED
WITH RELATED ILLNESSES.

IN 2002, A FEW AMERICANS
GOT FED UP WITH BEING OVERWEIGHT

AND DID WHAT WE DO BEST.

THEY SUED THE BASTARDS.

TAKING AIM
AT THE FAST-FOOD COMPANIES

AND BLAMING THEM
FOR THEIR OBESITY AND ILLNESSES,

A LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN NEW YOR
K ON BEHALF OF TWO TEENAGE GIRLS
,

ONE WHO WAS 14 YEARS OLD,
4'10", AND 170 POUNDS,

THE OTHER, 19 YEARS OLD,
5'6", AND 270 POUNDS.

THE UNTHINKABLE
HAD SUDDENLY BECOME REALITY.

PEOPLE WERE SUING THE GOLDEN
ARCHES FOR SELLING THEM FOOD

.
THAT MOST OF US KNOW ISN'T
GOOD FOR YOU TO BEGIN WITH

YET EACH DAY,
ONE IN FOUR AMERICANS

VISITS A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

AND THIS HUNGER FOR FAST FOO
D ISN'T JUST IN AMERICA.

IT'S HAPPENING
ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

McDONALD'S ALONE OPERATES
MORE THAN 30,000 JOINTS

IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES
ON 6 CONTINENTS

AND FEEDS MORE THAN 46 MILLION
PEOPLE WORLDWIDE EVERY DAY
.

THAT'S MORE THAN
THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF SPAIN
.

,
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE

McDONALD'S ACCOUNTS FOR 43
% OF THE TOTAL FAST-FOOD MARKET.

,
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE --
WALMARTS, AIRPORTS, REST STOPS

GAS STATIONS, TRAIN STATIONS
, SHOPPING MALLS,

DEPARTMENT STORES,
AMUSEMENT PARTS, EVEN HOSPITALS.

THAT'S RIGHT -- HOSPITALS.

.
AT LEAST YOU'RE CLOSE
WHEN THE CORONARY KICKS IN

"
LAWYERS FOR McDONALD'S
CALLED THE SUITS "FRIVOLOUS,

STATING THAT THE DANGERS O
F ITS FOOD ARE UNIVERSALLY KNOWN

AND THAT THESE KIDS CAN'T SHOW
THAT THEIR WEIGHT PROBLEMS

AND HEALTH WOES WERE CAUSE
D SOLELY BY THEIR McDIETS.

THE JUDGE STATES, HOWEVER,

THAT IF LAWYERS
FOR THE TEENS CAN SHOW

THAT McDONALD'S INTENDS
FOR PEOPLE TO EAT ITS FOOD

Y
FOR EVERY MEAL OF EVERY DA

AND THAT DOING SO WOULD BE
UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS,

THEY MAY BE ABLE
TO STATE A CLAIM.

?
ARE THE FOOD COMPANIES SOLEL
Y TO BLAME FOR THIS EPIDEMIC

WHERE DOES PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY STOP

AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
BEGIN?

IS FAST FOOD
REALLY THAT BAD FOR YOU?

S
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF I ATE NOTHING BUT McDONALD'

FOR 30 DAYS STRAIGHT?

WOULD I SUDDENLY BE
ON THE FAST TRACK

TO BECOMING AN OBESE AMERICAN?

WOULD IT BE
UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?

LET'S FIND OUT.

I'M READY.

SUPER-SIZE ME.

I ALSO WENT TO A FANCY
NEW YORK WELLNESS CENTER

TO MEET A REGISTERED DIETICIAN

WHO WOULD HELP
TRACK MY PROGRESS.

OKAY, LET'S START WITH
GETTING YOUR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT.

I'M 6'2".

I WEIGHT ABOUT 185
.

FOR YOUR HEIGHT,
THIS IS A HEALTHY WEIGHT.

I CAN TELL YOU THAT
RIGHT NOW.

YOUR BMI,
WHICH IS THE BODY MASS INDEX,

IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS,
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT OBESE.

YOU'RE ACTUALLY
AT THE CORRECT WEIGHT.

AT
SO, I SHOULD KEEP A CHECKL
IST OF THE THINGS THAT I E

FOR BREAKFAST, LUN
CH, AND DINNER?

YOUR CALORIE NEEDS
ARE GONNA BE AVERAGING

ABOUT 2,500 CALORIES A DAY.

AS FAR AS FAT GOES,
FOR 2,500 CALORIES,

YOU'RE GONNA WANT ABOUT
80 GRAMS OF TOTAL FAT IN A DAY.

THE SATURATED FAT, WHICH IS
A COMPONENT OF TOTAL FAT,

YOU WANT TO HAVE
LESS THAN 25 GRAMS A DAY.

DON'T TRY TO OVERINDULGE
TOO MUCH.

GOOD LUCK, MORGAN.

HI, THERE. I'M ERIC ROWLEY
, OUR EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGIST.

GREAT.

Rowley:
THE OFFICIAL WEIGH-IN...

185 1/2.

WE'LL GO THROUGH
THE CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT,

AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO CALCULATE

HOW MUCH OXYGEN
YOUR MUSCLES CAN UTILIZE,

AND THAT'S ALSO AN INDICATOR

OF WHAT TYPE OF CONDITION YOUR
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IS IN.

ALL RIGHT, GOOD WORK.

I'M GONNA USE
THESE SKINFOLD CALIPERS

TO ESTIMATE
YOUR BODY DENSITY.

YOU'RE 11% BODY FAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

WE'RE GONNA
MEASURE YOUR FLEXIBILITY

OF YOUR HAMSTRINGS, YOUR HIPS,
AND YOUR LOWER BACK.

GOOD, GOOD.
VERY NICE.

38 CENTIMETERS
WAS YOUR BEST.

THERE'S A BASIC
OLD-SCHOOL TEST

FOR MUSCULAR STRENGTH
AND ENDURANCE.

36. GOOD JOB.

GE,
YOU'RE ABOVE AVERA

ABOVE AVERAGE FITN
ESS FOR YOUR AGE GROUP,

DEFINITELY, I'D SA
YOU'RE AT A GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW.

MORE THAN 60% OF AMERICANS
GET NO FORM OF EXERCISE,

SO FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS,
NEITHER WILL I.

BUT I'LL STILL HAVE TO WALK.

HOW MUCH DOES THE AVER
AGE AMERICAN WALK A DA
Y?

WE HAVE THESE PEDOMETERS
THAT WE PUT ON PEOPLE,

STEP COUNTERS.

YOU COULD VERY ROUGHLY
ESTIMATE AT ABOUT 2,000 STEPS,

BECAUSE 2,000
WOULD MAKE A MILE.

AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE
THAT WORK IN OFFICE SETTINGS,

WHO DRIVE A CAR
TO AND FROM WORK,

WHO TAKE AN ELEVATOR
UP TO THAT OFFICE,

MAY TAKE AS LITTLE
AS 2,500 OR 3,000 STEPS

IN THEIR ENTIRE DAY.

IF YOU WANTED TO FEEL PHYSICALLY
LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS DO,

THEN YOU'D LIMIT YOURSELF
TO ABOUT 5,000 STEPS A DAY.

US NEW YORKERS --
WE WALK EVERYWHERE.

WE WALK TO WORK,
TO THE PARK, TO THE STORE.

.
MOST OF US DON'T EVEN OWN CARS

-
THE AVERAGE NEW YORKER WILL WALK
FOUR TO FIVE MILES A DAY -

A DAY!

THAT'S A LOT OF WALKING.

E
I'LL ALSO HAVE THE BLESSIN
G OF BEING CLOSE TO A FOOD SOURC

ALMOST EVERYWHERE I GO.

I WALK PAST THREE GOLDEN ARCHE
S JUST ON MY WAY TO THE OFFICE -
-

THREE IN JUST OVER A MILE.

THERE ARE MORE MICKEY D's
IN MANHATTAN

THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

THIS TINY LITTLE ISLAND
IS LESS THAN 13 MILES LONG

BY 2 MILES WIDE,
22.4 SQUARE MILES,

AND PACKED INTO THAT AREA
ARE 83 McDONALD'S,

NEARLY FOUR PER SQUARE MILE.

THERE ARE
TWICE AS MANY MAC SHACKS

AS THERE ARE BURGER KINGS,

AND THERE ARE
MORE McDONALD'S THAN KFC,

WENDY'S, POPEYES,
AND TACO BELL COMBINED.

THAT'S A LOT OF BURGER.

I KNOW HE'S
GONNA DO IT FOR A MONTH,

BUT I THINK AFTER A WEEK,
HE'S GONNA BE REALLY IRRITATED
.

I THINK IT'S GONNA
AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

Man:
YOU ARE A VEGAN CHEF.

YES, I'M A VEGAN CHEF.

UGH. I JUST DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN --

OF COURSE I WILL.

I'LL SIT NEXT TO HIM
WHILE HE EATS McDONALD'S.

OF COURSE I WILL.

A MISS SO MUCH.

WHAT AM I GONNA HAVE
THAT'S ORGANIC?

IN THE NEXT MONTH?
NOTHING?

YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE

HERE FOR YOU.

THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

HAVE THEY IMPROVED THEIR COOKIES
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS

.
LAST TIME I HAD THEM, THEY WER
E LIKE LITTLE HOCKEY PUCKS

I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL SEE.

IT'S THE FIRST DAY,

AND I'M ON MY WAY
TO BREAKFAST.

COULD I GET AN EGG McMUFFI
N EXTRA VALUE MEAL?

EVERY 8-YEAR-OLD'S
DREAM RIGHT NOW

THAT I'M GETTING READY
TO FULFILL.

I GOT MY EGG McMUFFIN.

THAT'S GONNA BE
THE FIRST THING RIGHT THERE.

[ SLURPING ]

THIS McDONALD'S
DELIVERS FOR FREE.

ALL I DID TODAY
WAS LEAVE MY APARTMENT,

-
WALK DOWN THE STAIRS,
AND WALK TO THE McDONALD'S -

1,272 STEPS.

SO, WE GOT TO GO TO THE CORNER
AND WE GOT TO GET A CAB.

THE CABS ARE GONNA
ADD UP IN THIS THING.

I CAN TELL ALREADY.

I GOT MY SCORECARD,

AND IN HERE,
I HAD ONE EGG McMUFFIN.

I HAD ONE SAUSAGE BISCUIT.

DO YOU EAT FAST FOOD?

ONCE IN A WHILE.

YEAH? HOW OFTEN?

KS.
I'D SAY PROBABLY
ONCE EVERY TWO WEE

THREE, FOUR TIME
S A WEEK MAYBE.

.
IN FRANCE, YES

BUT HERE, NO.
I DON'T LIKE HERE.

IT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY...CLEAN.

AND WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE PLACE?

.
PROBABLY WENDY'S

McDO.

TACO BELL.

TACO BELL.

.
McDONALD'S IS PRETTY CLOSE

DO YOU EVER HAVE
SUPERSIZED COKES?

NO, IN FRANCE...

CE.
THE SMALL SIZE HER
E, IT'S A BIGGER SIZE IN FRAN

EVEN THE SMALL SIZE HE
RE, I CAN'T DRINK.

THERE ARE RULES
TO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE

IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS.

I WILL ONLY SUPER-SIZE IT
IF THEY ASK ME.

I CAN ONLY EAT THINGS
THAT ARE FOR SALE

.
OVER THE COUNTER AT McDONALD'S

WATER INCLUDED.

IF McDONALD'S DOESN'T SELL IT,
I CAN'T EAT IT.

I HAVE TO HAVE
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU

AT LEAST ONCE
OVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS,

AND I HAVE TO HAVE
THREE SQUARES A DAY --

.
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER

NO EXCUSES.

OH, I LOVE BIG MACS.

E
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIM

THAT I'VE SEEN A BIG MAC
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE,

THAT ACTUALLY ALMOST
LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE.

LOOK AT THAT.

BIG MACS NEVER LOOK THIS GOOD.

YOU GOT TO COME TO CHINATOWN
FOR THE GOOD BIG MACS.

MMM.

YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT ALL THESE PEOPLE

WHO ARE SUING
THESE FAST-FOOD COMPANIES.

YES, I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS,

BUT IT'S THE AMERICAN 
WAY TO SUE FOR EVERYTHING.

I'D THROW THE LAWSUIT OUT
IF I WAS A JUDGE.

AND LIKE I WAS SAYING,

IF THESE FAST-FOOD PLACES
CAN PUT THEIR SIGNS UP,

IF I CAN WALK BY THEM
AND JUST TOTALLY IGNORE THEM

AND SAY, "I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I DON'T NEED THIS,"

THEY CAN DO IT, TOO.

.
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE. W
E DON'T HAVE TO SHOP WITH THEM

WE CAN EASILY GO IN McDONALD'S
AND GRAB A SALAD,

BUT WE CHOOSE NOT TO.

NOW, IF THE McDONALD'S
REFUSED THEM SERVICE,

THEY'D BE IN COURT AGAIN SAYING,
"WE WERE REFUSED SERVICE."

SO YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU TR
Y IN THIS WORLD.

I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS
ON THE FAST-FOOD COMPANIES

BECAUSE THEY ARE MENTIONED MOR
E

THAN VIRTUALLY
ALL THE OTHER CAUSES

IN MOST OF THE ARTICLES
AND BOOKS AND STUDIES

ABOUT WHY IT'S
A SUDDEN EPIDEMIC.

AGAIN, IT CAN'T BE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT.

WE'VE HAD
NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS

FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

IT CAN'T BE THE FOODS
WE EAT AT HOME.

WE'VE BEEN EATING AT HOME
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

SOMETHING IS VERY DIFFERENT.

I THINK THE FIGURE IS WE EAT OUT
SOMETHING LIKE 40% OF OUR MEALS.

Morgan: JOHN BANZHAF
IS CURRENTLY SPEARHEADING

THE ATTACKS
AGAINST THE FOOD INDUSTRY,

ADVISING MANY OF THE LAWYERS

WHO ARE CURRENTLY
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS.

PEOPLE SAY HE'S CRAZY,

BUT THAT'S WHAT
THEY USED TO SAY ABOUT HIM

WHEN HE FIRST SUED
THE TOBACCO COMPANIES...

UNTIL HE WON.

I THINK IN TERMS
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

IT'S FAIR TO POINT
THE BIG GUN AT McDONALD'S.

McDONALD'S IS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IT IS THE ONE WHICH,

FAR MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS
, LURES IN YOUNG CHILDREN.

.
THEY HAVE THE PLAYGROUNDS,
THE CLOSED, INDOOR PLAYGROUNDS

.
MANY PLACES,
THERE ARE NO OTHER PLAYGROUNDS

YOU'VE GOT TO
TAKE YOUR KID THERE.

SO EVEN AT 2 AND 3 AND 4,

THOSE KIDS ARE BEING
LURED INTO THERE.

McDONALD'S IS VERY HEAVY
ON BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

THEY, OF COURSE,
PIONEERED THE HAPPY MEALS,

O
NOW THE MIGHTY KIDS' MEALS ALS

WITH THOSE LITTLE
"GOTTA HAVE 'EM" TOYS.

SO THEY GET THE KIDS IN.

AND, OF COURSE, THE WHOLE CLOWN.
McDONALD'S HAS THE CLOWN.

A LOT OF THOSE ADS
APPEAL PRIMARILY TO KIDS.

THERE'S A CARTOON ON TV
WHICH FEATURES HIM.

SO THEY, MORE THAN OTHERS,
LURE THE KIDS IN.

I THINK ALL OF US ARE FAR MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE KIDS.

S
Morgan: ANOTHER MAN
WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT THE KID

IS SAMUEL HIRSCH.

HE REPRESENTS THE TWO GIRL
S WHO ARE SUING McDONALD'S,

WITH MUCH ADVISEMENT
COMING FROM PROFESSOR BANZHAF.

WHY ARE YOU SUING
THE FAST-FOOD ESTABLISHMENT?

YOU MEAN MOTIVES BESIDES
MONETARY RECOMPENSATION?

YOU MEAN YOU WANT
TO HEAR A NOBLE CAUSE?

IS THAT IT?

UM...

I THINK THAT FAST FOODS

ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR
TO THIS EPIDEMIC.

Morgan: IN 2000,
DR. DAVID SATCHER

BECAME THE FIRST SURGEON GENERAL

TO DRAW ATTENTION
TO THE OBESITY CRISIS,

DECLARING IT
A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC.

NOW, REMEMBER,
WE'RE SUPER-SIZING EVERYTHING.

YOU GO TO ANY FAST FOOD STORE,

AND THEY'RE TRAINED TO TELL YO
U TO BUY A BIGGER SIZE.

.
FOR FIVE CENTS MORE,
YOU CAN GET THE SUPER SIZE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL DEFINE A PIECE OF MEAT,

THREE OUNCES OF MEAT,
AS A SENSIBLE PORTION,

AND THAT LOOKS LIKE
A DECK OF CARDS.

FEW PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THIS DECK OF CARDS

IF THEY WERE SERVED A PIECE OF
MEAT, A STEAK, IN A RESTAURANT
.

.
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THIS SIZE

ONE TYPICAL BAGEL
THAT ONE IS EATING

THAT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS

IS GOING TO COMPRISE
FIVE SERVINGS OF BREAD.

WHEN FAST FOOD COMPANIES
FIRST OPENED,

THEY GENERALLY
INTRODUCED ONE SIZE.

FOR EXAMPLE,
ONE SIZE FRENCH FRIES

WHEN McDONALD'S FIRST OPENED
, CALLED "FRIES."

THAT SIZE FRIES
IS NOW CALLED "SMALL."

.
MEDIUM, LARGE, AND SUPERSIZE

THAT ORIGINAL SIZE
IS STILL HERE.

IT'S GOT ABOUT 200 CALORIES.

BUT THE SUPER SIZE IS GONN
A PACK IN OVER 600 CALORIES.

WHEN BURGER KING FIRST OPENED,

THEY HAD A 12-OUNCE SMALL
AND A 16-OUNCE LARGE.

.
THIS 12-OUNCE IS NOW KIDDY

THE 16-OUNCE IS NOW THE SMALL...

.
THE MEDIUM, THE 32, AND THE 42

AND THIS IS ACROSS THE BOARD
WITH ALL FAST-FOOD PLACES.

CARS HAVE INTRODUCED
LARGER CUPHOLDERS

TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE HUGE
7-ELEVEN DOUBLE GULPS,

WHICH ARE 64 OUNCES,
A HALF GALLON,

AND HOLD ANYWHERE
FROM 600 TO 800 CALORIES,

DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH ICE
YOU PUT IN.

Morgan:
A HALF-GALLON OF SODA?

A HALF-GALLON OF SODA
FOR ONE PERSON,

48 TEASPOONS OF SUGAR.

Woman:
HELLO, MAY I HELP YOU?

YEAH, COULD I GET

THE DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDER
WITH CHEESE MEAL?

LARGE OR SUPERSIZE?

I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GO SUPERSIZE.

[ Laughing ] LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT COKE.

THAT BARELY FITS IN THERE.

[ Laughing ]
OH, SHIT!

.
I'VE GOT A -- LOOK AT THAT

LOOK AT HOW BIG THAT THING IS.

LOOK HOW BIG THAT FRENCH FRY IS.

THAT THING IS,
LIKE, FOUR FEET TALL.

DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDER
WITH CHEESE.

MORE CALORIES THAN ANYTHING.

THERE IT IS --
A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN.

[ SMOOCHES ]

MMM!

THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD, MAN.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

YOU GET
ALL THAT SUPERSIZED STUFF,

THAT STUFF GETS SUPERSIZED
, MAN...

LOOK AT THAT.

I JUST PUT A --

I'M NOT EVEN HALFWAY DONE
WITH THOSE FRIES.

NOT EVEN HALFWAY.

[ GROANS ]

THIS IS LIKE A WORKOUT.

L
SEE, NOW'S THE TIME OF THE MEA

WHEN YOU START GETTING
THE McSTOMACHACHE.

.
YOU START GETTING THE McTUMMY.
YOU GET THE McGURGLES IN THERE

YOU GET THE McBRICK.

AND THEN YOU GET
THE McSTOMACHACHE.

RIGHT NOW I GOT SOME McGAS
THAT'S ROCKIN'.

Man:
ARE YOU SWEATING THERE?

MY ARMS -- I FEEL LIKE
I GOT SOME McSWEATS GOING.

MY ARMS GOT THE McTWITCHES
GOING IN HERE

FROM ALL OF THE SUGAR THAT'S
GOING IN MY BODY RIGHT NOW.

I'M FEELING A LITTLE McCRAZY

[ GROANING ]

JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

[ Laughing ]
I'M IN PURE McDONALD'S HEAVEN.

[ LAUGHS ]

Alex: THIS IS GONNA BE YOU
, LIKE, AFTER EVERY MEAL.

I'M DYING.

GOD,
THAT LOOKS SO NASTY.

[ BURPS ]

IT'S MAKINGMEPUKE.

[ VOMITING ]

OHHH...

YOU ALL RIGHT?

YEAH.

I BELIEVE WE LIVE
IN A TOXIC-FOOD

AND PHYSICAL-INACTIVITY
ENVIRONMENT.

THAT IS,
WE LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT

THAT ALMOST GUARANTEES
THAT WE BECOME SICK.

NOT 100% OF PEOPLE BECOME SICK,
BUT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO DO

ARE GROWING
AND GROWING AND GROWING.

,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT "TOXIC"
IS TOO STRONG A WORD, EITHER

BECAUSE AN EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY

WHERE 60% OF THE POPULATIO
N IS SUFFERING

S
AND RECORD NUMBERS
OF CHILDREN ARE HAVING THI

IS A CRISIS BY ANY STANDARD.

Morgan: THE TOXIC ENVIRONMEN
T IS CONSTANT ACCESS

TO CHEAP, FAT-LADEN FOODS.

IT'S GAS STATIONS THAT SEL
L MORE CANDY AND SODAS THAN GAS.

IT'S A NATION WHERE THERE
ARE MORE THAN 3 MILLION

SODA VENDING MACHINES.

THAT'S ONE
FOR EVERY 97 AMERICANS.

IT'S A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE DEPEND
COMPLETELY ON THEIR CARS

FOR TRANSPORTATION

AND WHERE WALKING
HAS BECOME SUCH A CHORE

THAT WE RELY ON MACHINES
TO DO IT FOR US.

MY STOMACH
FEELS HORRIBLE THIS MORNING.

IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD AT ALL.

THERE WE GO.

,
I'M GETTING THIS REALLY WEIR
D FEELING RIGHT IN MY MIDSECTION

BASICALLY IN MY PENIS RIGHT NOW,
AND IT'S JUST LIKE THIS --

[ MAKES WHOOSHING NOISE ]

IT'S REALLY FREAKY.

THAT IS VERY ODD.

YEAH.

IT COULD BE
FROM THE CAFFEINE,

BUT I COULDN'T REALLY
PINPOINT THAT 100%.

.
I HAVE A DELIVER
Y FOR MR. MORGAN

$13.39.

$13.39.

I MADE IT
OVER THE THREE-DAY HUMP.

YOU KNOW
HOW WHEN YOU QUIT SMOKING --

I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU
OUT THERE SMOKE CIGARETTES,

BUT YOU SHOULD STOP.

.
I QUIT SMOKING.
AND THERE'S THE THREE-DAY HUMP

[ Laughing ] THREE-DAY --
IT'S THE THREE-DAY HUMP

WHEN YOU QUIT
SMOKING CIGARETTES.

IF YOU CAN MAKE IT
OVER THOSE THREE DAYS

WITHOUT SMOKING ONE CIGARETTE,

IF YOU CAN MAKE IT PAST DAY ONE,
DAY TWO, DAY THREE, YOU'RE FINE.

SAME THING WITH THIS.

I MADE IT PAST DAY THREE.

I'M ALL RIGHT.

LEFT UNABATED,
OBESITY WOULD OVERTAKE SMOKING

AS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE
OF DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY.

Sullum: I WAS AT THIS MEAL
, AND IT CAME UP

THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE
WAS A SMOKER,

AND SOMEBODY ELSE AT THE TABLE
STARTED HECTORING THEM ABOUT IT.

"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

"DON'T YOU KNOW
HOW BAD IT IS FOR YOU?

"IT'LL DO THIS, THAT,
AND THE OTHER THING TO YOU
,

AND YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP."

AND THE SMOKER,
RATHER THAN SAYING, "FUCK YOU,

MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS" --

WHICH, I THINK,
IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE --

WAS ABASHED AND DEFENSIVE.

"OH, I TRIED TO QUIT,"

AND, "YEAH,
I'M GONNA TRY AGAIN,"

AND "YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT," AND SO ON.

AT THAT SAME TABLE,
THERE WAS A QUITE LARGE WOMAN,

AND I WAS WONDERING --
WHAT IF THIS GUY,

INSTEAD OF CONFRONTING
THE SMOKER,

HAD SAID TO THE LARGE WOMAN,

"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,
YOU FAT PIG?

"DON'T YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROU
S IT IS TO BE SO OVERWEIGHT?

,
"STOP EATING, FOR GOD'S SAKE
. AND DON'T YOU DARE GET DESSERT

AND WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?"

SAME LOGIC.

I'D BE HARD-PRESSED
TO FIND A DISTINCTION

.
BETWEEN THOSE TWO EXAMPLES

SO, ONE IS NOW
SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE --

TO HECTOR SMOKERS --

BUT THE OTHER ONE
ISN'T QUITE YET.

SO THE QUESTION IS,

AT WHAT POINT
WILL IT BECOME ACCEPTABLE

E
TO PUBLICLY HECTOR FAT PEOPL

IN THE WAY THAT SMOKERS
ARE PUBLICLY HECTORED?

A SECRET STUDY
BY ONE OF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES

HAD THE OMINOUS TITLE --
SOMETHING LIKE,

"BRAND IMPRINTING
FOR LATER ACTUATION IN LIFE."

THEY WOULD BUY
THE LITTLE TOY CIGARETTES,

AND THEY'D START
PLAY-SMOKING THEM

AT 4 OR 5 OR 6.

WOULDN'T EVEN
NOTICE THE PACK.

IF YOU ASKED THEM
WHAT PACK IT WAS,

THEY WOULDN'T NOTICE IT,

BUT THE THEORY WAS THAT
SOMEWHERE, IT'S BURIED IN HERE,

AND THEN WHEN THEY GET TO
THE AGE WHERE THEY'RE SMOKING,

WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT,

THEY'RE GOING FOR THAT PACK
THAT THEY RECOGNIZE

BECAUSE IT HAD
THOSE NICE FEELINGS FOR THEM

WHEN THEY WERE
LITTLE KIDS.

THE SAME WAY HERE --

THEY'RE SATISFIED,
IT'S NICE,

THEY REMEMBER
THE WARM FEELINGS

OF PLAYING
AND GETTING THE TOY,

BEING WITH MOM AND DAD.

IT'S GONNA CARRY THROUGH.

,
THAT'S WHY
WHEN I HAVE KIDS

,
EVERY TIME I DRIVE B
Y A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT

CE.
I'M GONNA
PUNCH MY KID IN THE FA

ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING
THINGS TO ME

IS THAT IN THE LAST
20 TO 25 YEARS,

WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A DOUBLING

OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE
CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.

Morgan: AND THIS WEIGHT GAIN
HAS BEEN LINKED

TO COUNTLESS HEALTH PROBLEMS
LATER IN LIFE, SUCH AS...

,
IN FACT,
IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE

ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE CHILDRE
N BORN IN THE YEAR 2000

WILL DEVELOP DIABETES
IN THEIR LIFETIME.

[ APPLAUSE ]

AT LEAST 17 MILLION AMERICAN
S NOW HAVE TYPE 2 DIABETES,

ABOUT ONE
OUT OF EVERY 20 PEOPLE.

IF THE DIABETES STARTS
BEFORE THE AGE OF 15,

YOU LOSE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
17 AND 27 YEARS OF LIFE-SPAN
.

ACCORDING TO THE NEW RESEARCH,

THE DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES

HAVE DOUBLED.

,
THEDIRECTMEDICAL COSTS HAVE
DOUBLED IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS

FROM $44 BILLION IN 1997
TO $92 BILLION IN 2002.

SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF
ABOUT 20% OF THE OBESE CHILDREN

HAVE ELEVATED ABNORMAL
LIVER FUNCTION TESTS,

Y
AND WE HAVE NOW STARTED A STUD

WHERE WE'RE
BIOPSYING THESE CHILDREN

TO SEE WHAT THEIR LIVERS
ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE

UNDER THE MICROSCOPE,

AND HALF OF THEM HAVE EVIDENCE
OF SCARRING OF THE LIVER,

FIBROSIS OF THE LIVER,
THE EARLY STAGES OF CIRRHOSIS.

SO, WHEN THESE CHILDREN
END UP BEING ADULTS,

THEY'RE GOING TO END UP --

,
IF THEY DON'T CHANGE THEIR
EATING AND EXERCISE HABITS

ARE GONNA END UP
WITH LIVER FAILURE

.
AND, WELL,
EITHER TRANSPLANT OR DEATH

DID YOU WANT LETTUCE
AND MAYONNAISE ON ALL OF THEM?

I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY HARD
FOR OVERWEIGHT TEENAGERS

BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO SEE

THE THIN, PRETTY,
POPULAR GIRLS,

AND YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT LOOK AT THEM

"
AND THINK, "I WISH I WAS HER,"
OR, "I WISH I COULD HAVE THAT.

AND IT'S DEPRESSING.
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP.

THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS,

AND OF COURSE
IT'S HARD BEING A TEENAGER

BECAUSE YOU SEE ALL THE GIRL
S IN THECOSMOGIRL

ORTEEN PEOPLE,
AND THEY'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL,

AND YOU THINK, "AREN'T I
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THAT?"

AND IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC.

IT'S NOT A REALISTIC
WAY TO LIVE.

[ APPLAUSE ]

SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
LET'S WELCOME JARED FOGLE.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

.
MY BIG THING WAS NEVER SMOKING

IT WAS NEVER DRINKING.

OBVIOUSLY,
IT WASN'T DOING DRUGS.

MY BIG VICE WAS FOOD,

.
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
I WOUND UP WEIGHING 425 POUNDS

I BROUGHT IN
A PRESENT FOR YOU --

MY OLD PANTS
THAT ARE NOW MADE FAMOUS

IN ALL THE SUBWAY COMMERCIALS.

[ APPLAUSE ]

YOU'RE WELCOME.

Woman: THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, VICTORIA.

SHE'S AN EIGHTH-GRADE
HONOR STUDENT,

AND YOU'RE A REAL
INSPIRATION TO THE KIDS.

I REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT.

THAT'S ONE
OF THE GREATEST --

ON,
I STARTED
PUTTING MY WEIGHT

AS YOU GUYS KNOW
, ABOUT THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE.

SHE WAS REAL TINY
WHEN SHE WAS LITTLER,

AND IT'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY.

IN FACT,
I HAD A GREAT-GRANDFATHER

X
THAT DIED
AND WAS BURIED IN A PIANO BO

YEARS AND YEARS AGO,
SO IT'S A HISTORY.

ABSOLUTELY.

AND SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO MAINTAIN HER WEIGHT.

IT'S TOUGH.
IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE.

YS.
I KNOW AS A KID,
IT'S AWFULLY HARD THESE DA

AND KIDS
ARE NOT ALWAYS KIND.

D.
NO, NOT AT ALL
. AND I KNOW THAT FIRSTHAN

GE.
AND THE PROBLEM IS,
THE WORLD'S NOT GONNA CHAN

YOUHAVE TO CHANGE.

I GUESS IT'S KIND OF COOL
TO KNOW SOMEBODY

OR BE ABLE
TO LISTEN TO SOMEBODY

,
TALK ABOUT ACTUALLY
BEING WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW

AND IT'S KIND OF HARD

BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD
TO GO THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY

AND BUY A SANDWICH
TWO TIMES A DAY,

AND THAT'S
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT,

LIKE THAT'S
THE ONLY SOLUTION.

THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
WORKED THE BEST,

BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.

Y
AND I'VE TRIED OTHER WAYS,
AND IT'S KIND OF HURT MY BOD

FROM DOING OTHER WAYS
THAT I'VE TRIED TO DO.

AND IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO, LIKE, LOOK AT SOMEONE

WHO SAYS, "HEY, I'VE DONE IT
. YOU CAN DO IT."

BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

Robbins:
I'D BEEN SICK AS A KID.

I GREW UP EATING
A LOT OF ICE CREAM,

MORE THAN YOU CAN BELIEVE.

WE HAD AN ICE-CREAM-CONE-SHAPE
D SWIMMING POOL IN OUR BACKYARD.

WE HAD A COMMERCIAL FREEZER WITH
NOT ONLY ALL 31 FLAVORS IN IT,

BUT ALL EXPERIMENTAL FLAVORS
THAT WERE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

AND I MADE MYSELF
THE OFFICIAL TASTER.

I HAD TO APPROVE EVERYTHING,
IN MY MIND.

AND I LOVED IT.
WHAT KID WOULDN'T?

I LITERALLY
HAD UNLIMITED ICE CREAM.

I ATE ICE CREAM FOR BREAKFAST.

BUT I WAS SICK A LOT.

.
AND I WASN'T VERY ATHLETIC

I WAS REALLY ILL.

AND I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

SO I WOULD KIND OF APPEASE THA
T BY EATING MORE ICE CREAM.

YOU CAN SEE HOW THE VICIOU
S CYCLE WOULD TAKE PLACE.

ONE OF THE TRIGGERING FACTOR
S FOR ME WAS MY UNCLE,

BURT BASKIN, MY DAD'S PARTNE
R AND BROTHER-IN-LAW,

CO-FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY --
DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.

I THINK HE WAS 51.

NOW, MY UNCLE WEIGHED
ABOUT 240 POUNDS --

HEAVYSET FELLOW.

,
AND WHEN HE DIED,
AS A YOUNG MAN, I ASKED MY DAD

N
"DO YOU THINK
THERE COULD BE A CONNECTIO

BETWEEN HIS FATAL HEART ATTACK

"
AND THE AMOUNT
OF ICE CREAM HE WOULD EAT?

MY FATHER SAID,
"NO, HIS TICKER JUST GOT TIRED

AND STOPPED WORKING."

BY THIS TIME,
HE HAD SOLD MORE ICE CREAM

THAN ANY HUMAN BEING THAT HA
D EVER LIVED ON THIS PLANET.

HE DIDN'T WANT TO THINK THAT
THE PRODUCT WAS HURTING ANYBODY,

THAT IT HAD CONTRIBUTED
TO THE DEATH

.
OF HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, PARTNER
, AND, IN MANY WAYS, BEST FRIEND

NO WAY.

"
BEN COHEN,
THE BEN OF "BEN & JERRY'S,

A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
HAD A QUINTUPLE BYPASS PROCEDURE

AT THE AGE OF 49.

MY UNCLE,
BURT BASKIN OF BASKIN-ROBBINS,

DIES AT THE AGE OF 51
OF A HEART ATTACK.

,
MY FATHER, IRV ROBBINS, TH
E OTHER FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY

.
ENDED UP
WITH VERY SERIOUS DIABETES

.
YOU CAN'T DENY THESE LINKS

YOU JUST CAN'T.

YEAH, COULD I GET
THE TWO-CHEESEBURGER MEAL?

OKAY, SUPERSIZED.

SECOND TIME.

MMM.

.
THANK YOU, SIR

THANKS, MAN.

Bennett: AFTER FIVE DAYS
ON THE McDONALD'S DIET,

WHAT I DID WAS I RAN THREE DAYS'
WORTH OF FOOD ANALYSIS.

THE NEEDS FOR YOU TO MAINTAIN
WEIGHT AT THE 185

THAT YOU WERE AT
WHEN YOU CAME IN -- 186 POUNDS

WAS APPROXIMATELY
2,500 CALORIES.

RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GETTING
ALMOST 5,000 CALORIES A DAY,

THE AVERAGE BEING 4,986.

I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO TAKE A MULTIVITAMIN.

McDONALD'S DOESN'T SEL
L MULTIVITAMINS.

WELL,
HERE'S MY NEW ADVICE,

IS JUST KIND OF
MINIMIZE THE MEALS.

A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE HOT FUDGE
SUNDAE WOULD BE THE YOGURT.

Morgan: THAT IS TRUE,
IF YOU GET THE SNACK SIZE --

FIVE OUNCES.

IF YOU GET THE REGULAR SIZ
E WITHOUT GRANOLA,

IT CONTAINS NEARLY AS MANY
CALORIES AS A STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.

WITHGRANOLA,
IT HAS MORE CALORIES

THAN THE HOT FUDGE
OR CARAMEL SUNDAE.

,
AND IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
THINK TWICE ABOUT THE PARFAITS

THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?

THERE'S A BIG,
NAPPY HAIR IN IT!

THAT'S DISGUSTING.

I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW WE DO IT.

YOU GO LIKE THIS.
WE GO... [ WHISTLES ]

LOOK, IT'S LONG, TOO!
DID YOU SEE THAT!

[ LAUGHS ]
OH, THAT'S SO GROSS!

ONLY THE FINEST AT McDONALD'S.

HERE WE ARE AT 190
. 192, 193, 194.

NO.

WE HAVE TO STOP EVERYTHING.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

195 POUNDS.

IT CAN'T BE.
WE HAVE TO REDO THIS.

THAT'S ZERO.

SECOND TRY.

88, 92, 94.

YOU'VE GAINED, ACTUALLY,
ABOUT 5% OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT.

LOSING AND GAINING WEIGHT
THAT FAST IS NOT HEALTHY.

OD?
DO YOU EAT FAST FO

YES, I DO.

[ Laughing ]
UNFORTUNATELY.

T!
OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH.
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE I

.
LOVE FAST FOOD

HOW OFTEN
DO YOU GUYS EAT IT?

EVERY WEEK?

OH, MAYBE ONCE
OR TWICE A WEEK.

WE'RE GONNA GO HIT UP
McDONALD'S IN A LITTLE WHILE.

AY.
AT LEAST TWO TIMES TOD

YOU KNOW WE AIN'T HAD
NO MEAL YET TODAY.

WE WAS JUST POINTING
TOWARDS McDONALD'S.

I GET THE NUMBER TWO,
THE CHEESEBURGER

WITH THE SUPERSIZE COKE
AND FRIES.

SUPER-SIZE IT UP
! MAKE IT BACON, 69 CENTS.

THAT'S WHAT THEY S
AY. "MAKE IT BACON."

MAKE IT BACON, BABY.

HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD EAT FAST FOOD?

LL.
I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY SHOULD EAT IT AT A

LD.
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOU

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.

!
OH, THAT'S BALONEY

IT'S BALONEY!

WHAT THEY NEED TO DO
IS 25 MINUTES ON THAT TREADMILL,

WORK OUT A LITTLE,
DO SOME PUSH-UPS.

IF YOU DO SOME PUSH-UPS
WHEN YOU EAT,

YOU'LL KEEP
YOUR WEIGHT DOWN.

I KEEP MY WEIGHT DOWN.

I HIT THEM PUSH-UPS
AND EVERYTHING,

KEEP MYSELF COOL.

WHO HAS TIME TO DO THAT?
WE HAVE TO WORK.

.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF KI
DS. WE HAVE TO CLEAN

SO YOU EXERCISE --
YOU RUN AFTER YOUR KIDS.

?? CHICKEN ??

[ SQUAWKING ]

THESE ARE THE FIRST
McNUGGETS I'VE HAD

IN THIS WHOLE EXCITING
TOUR OF DUTY.

LOOK AT THAT
GLISTENING IN THE SUN.

MMM.

BOY, THAT IS MISERABLE.

I'M NOT SURE WHAT PORTION OF THE
CHICKEN THAT'S SHAPED LIKE THAT.

I'M GUESSING
THIS IS THE FOOT ON THE CHICKEN.

IN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM,

McDONALD'S STATED
IN THEIR OWN DEFENSE

THAT IT'S A MATTER
OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE

THAT ANY PROCESSING
THAT ITS FOODS UNDERGO

SERVE TO MAKE THEM MORE HARMFU
L THAN UNPROCESSED FOODS.

.
CASE IN POINT -- McNUGGETS

ORIGINALLY CREATED
FROM OLD CHICKENS

THAT COULD NO LONGER LAY EGGS,

McNUGGETS ARE NOW
MADE FROM CHICKENS

.
WITH UNUSUALLY LARGE BREASTS

THEY'RE STRIPPED FROM THE BONE

AND GROUND UP
INTO A SORT OF CHICKEN MASH,

WHICH IS THEN COMBINED

WITH ALL SORTS OF STABILIZER
S AND PRESERVATIVES,

,
PRESSED INTO FAMILIAR SHAPES

BREADED, DEEP-FRIED,
FREEZE-DRIED,

AND THEN SHIPPED
TO A McDONALD'S NEAR YOU.

JUDGE ROBERT SWEET CALLED THEM

"A McFRANKENSTEIN CREATION
OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS

"
NOT UTILIZED BY THE HOME COOK.

,
SO, FOR THE PAST COUPLE DAYS

WHICH I HAVEN'T
SHARED WITH EVERYBODY --

IT'S BEEN A NEW THING --

I'VE STARTED TO HAVE --
NOT CHEST PAINS, BUT PRESSURE.

I FEEL LIKE I GOT PRESSURE
ON MY CHEST.

I FIGURE THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT A GOOD THING.

BUT NEITHER'S
EATING ALL THIS, SO...

I TELL YOU.
I HAVEN'T SMELLED BAD YET.

Man:
YEAH, YOU HAVE.

NO, I HAVEN'T.

YOU JUST DON'T SMELL
HOW BAD YOU SMELL.

LOOK AT THAT FISH FILET.

LOOK AT THIS THING.

OH, GOD,
THAT LOOKS NASTY, MAN.

ISN'T THAT HORRIBLE?

OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S BEEN
SITTING AROUND ALL DAY.

THAT, THE FILET-O-FISH.

UGH.

SHIT!

Woman:
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

CAN I GET THE DOUBLE QUARTER
POUNDER WITH CHEESE VALUE MEAL
?

OKAY, THANK YOU.
$4.86.

I DON'T FEEL GOOD TODAY.

NOT THAT I FEEL SICK,

BUT I JUST FEEL
REALLY DEPRESSED,

.
YOU KNOW, FOR NO REASON.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE GOING GREAT

I'VE HAD A GOOD DAY.

I JUST FEEL REALLY...

YEAH.

IT'S NOT REAL HARD
EATING THIS FOOD ALL THE TIME,

JUST BECAUSE IT TASTES GOOD,
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.

,
I REALLY NOTICED I'LL EAT SOME

AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE LATER,
I'LL BE HUNGRY AGAIN,

AND I'LL WANT MORE --
MORE, MORE, MORE.

I'M PRETTY BORED
WITH THEIR MENU.

IT ONLY TOOK ME NINE DAYS.

.
BUT IT'S PRETTY GOOD OTHERWISE

NINE DAYS.

[ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ]

?? MMM, DO THAT AGAIN ??

Woman: HOW MANY?

Morgan: HOW MANY'S
THE QUESTION.

WE ALWAYS ASK HOW MANY,

AND HE HOLDS UP
HOW MANY FINGERS.

?
THAT'S IT.
IT'S ALWAYS THE "HOW MANY"

IT'S JUST ONE FOR NOW.

AS SOON AS I GOT MY FIRST CAR,

THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE
I CAME TO.

I BOUGHT THREE BIG MACS,
ATE THEM OUT THERE.

I ENJOYED THEM SO MUCH,

I CAME BACK ABOUT 5:00 AT NIGHT,
BOUGHT THREE MORE,

ATE THEM OUT THERE,

CAME BACK AROUND 11:00
BEFORE THEY CLOSED,

AND ATE THREE MORE,

SO THE FIRST DAY I CAME HERE
, I ATE NINE BIG MACS,

AND IT WAS LIKE I COULDN'T GET
ENOUGH HAMBURGER AT THAT TIME,

AND BIG MACS ARE SO GOOD,

SO I ATE 265
IN THE FIRST MONTH.

Morgan: HOW MANY DO YOU EAT
A DAY, USUALLY?

USUALLY IT'S TWO A DAY.

NOW, LAST YEAR,
I ATE 741 LAST YEAR.

,
THAT'S MORE THAN TWO A DAY

SO THAT MEANS
THERE'S DAYS I HAD THREE,

BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE GETTING SMALLER.

PROBABLY 90% OF MY SOLID DIE
T IS PROBABLY BIG MACS.

THAT PARKING SPOT,

THAT'S WHERE I ASKED HER
IF SHE WANTED TO GET MARRIED
.

THIS PLACE IS SPECIAL --
A LOT OF REASONS.

I HAD ONE WHOPPER
IN MY LIFE -- 1984.

A GUY GAVE ME 5 BUCKS
TO EAT A WHOPPER.

AFTER I ATE THE WHOPPER,

TOOK MY 5 BUCKS OVER TO
McDONALD'S, GOT SOME BIG MACS.

I ALWAYS MAKE FUN
OF PEOPLE AT WORK.

THEY SAY, "I'M GAINING WEIGHT."

I SAY, "WELL, YOU SHOULD
TRY THE GORSKE DIET."

THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.

THIS IS A PERFECT SANDWICH
, YOU KNOW.

AT LEAST FOR ME, IT IS.

Morgan: THERE IT IS --
BITE NUMBER 19,000.

,
Gorske: THE WIFE SAYS WHEN SHE'S
GOT TO PUT THEM IN A BLENDER

IT ENDS.

THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

BIG MAC SMOOTHIES.

?? OOH-OOH-OOH ??

?? OOH ??

AMERICA'S BEEN McDONALDIZED,
YOU KNOW.

IT'S BEEN FRANCHISED OUT.

IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE
"FLINTSTONES" CARTOONS

WHERE THEY JUST HAD SOMETHIN
G ROLLING IN THE BACKGROUND.

YOU KEPT SEEING
THE SAME BUILDINGS GO BY.

IT'S LIKE
K-MART, WALMART, McDONALD'S,

K-MART, WALMART,
WENDY'S, K-MART.

.
AND IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE NO SENS
E OF WHERE YOU'RE AT ANYMORE

THE WAY I LOOK AT IT
IS C?ZANNE WAS INSPIRED

BY THE MOUNTAIN HE SAW
OUT HIS WINDOW,

AND WHEN I LOOK OUT MY WINDOW,
I SEE NO MOUNTAINS.

I JUST SEE BILLBOARDS
AND ADVERTISEMENTS,

SO I USE THAT AS MY INSPIRATION.

THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CHILD

SEES 10,000 FOOD ADVERTISEMENT
S PER YEAR ON TELEVISION.

95% OF THOSE
ARE FOR SUGARED CEREALS,

SOFT DRINKS,
FAST FOODS, OR CANDY.

A PARENT WHO EATS
EVERY MEAL EVERY DAY

FOR THE WHOLE YEAR
WITH THEIR CHILD

AND AT EVERY MEAL GIVES A VERY
COMPELLING NUTRITION MESSAGE

AND CAN BRING IN CARTOON
CHARACTERS AND MICHAEL JORDAN --

SO INSTEAD
OF SELLING McDONALD'S,

HE SELLS ORANGES --

AND BRITNEY SPEARS,
INSTEAD OF SELLING PEPSI

WILL SELL RADISHES
OR LETTUCE OR SOMETHING --

THAT PARENTS WILL HAVE
1,000 CRACKS AT THEIR CHILD,

COMPARED TO 10,000
FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

SO IT'S NOT A FAIR FIGHT.

BY THE TIME KIDS
ARE ABLE TO SPEAK,

MOST OF THEM CAN SAY
"McDONALD'S."

HE'S THE CHARACTER
THAT MADE McDONALD'S,

AND HE DOES A LOT
OF FUNNY STUFF ON TV.

MAKING SURE
YOU KNOW THEIR PRODUCT.

IN 2001,
ON DIRECT MEDIA ADVERTISING --

THAT'S RADIO,

McDONALD'S SPENT
$1.4 BILLION WORLDWIDE.

ON DIRECT MEDIA ADVERTISING,

PEPSI SPENT
MORE THAN $1 BILLION.

TO ADVERTISE ITS CANDY,

HERSHEY FOODS SPENT UNDER A MERE
$200 MILLION INTERNATIONALLY

" FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CAMPAIGN'S

TOTAL ADVERTISING BUDGET
IN ALL MEDIA

WAS A LOWLY $2 MILLION,

100 TIMES LESS THAN

IN WHICH FOOD MARKETING
IS UBIQUITOUS.

FOR ALL THEIR PRODUCTS
IS AVAILABLE ON-LINE,

BUT ACCORDING
TO THE 2000 U.S. CENSUS,

MORE THAN HALF OF ALL U.S. HOMES

APPLETON CENTRAL
ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL

IS FILLED WITH STUDENTS WHO HAVE
TRUANCY AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

BUT THEY'VE TURNED
THINGS AROUND --

NOT THROUGH DISCIPLINE,
BUT THROUGH DIET.

WE WERE FORTUNATE
TO KIND OF STUMBLE ACROSS

THIS HEALTHY PROGRAM
AS A RESULT OF SOME CONTAC
T

WITH NATURAL OVEN AND BAKERY
OF MANITOWOC WISCONSIN,

AND THEY BELIEVE
IN LOW-FAT, LOW-SUGAR,

NON-CHEMICALLY PROCESSED FOODS

THAT ARE FREE OF DYES
AND PRESERVATIVES,

FULL OF WHOLE GRAINS,

A LOT OF FRESH FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES.

WE DO NO BEEF HERE AT ALL,

AND THEN IT'S THE METHOD
OF PREPARATION,

WHERE WE DON'T FRY.

A LOT OF BAKING
AND THEN JUST FRESH PREPARATION,

AS OPPOSED TO OPENING CANS

OR THAWING THINGS OUT
FROM THE BOX.

WE GOT RID OF CANDY MACHINES
, SODA MACHINES,

BROUGHT IN BOTTLED WATER,
AND IT WAS JUST A SITUATIO
N

WHERE WE SAW A MAJOR CHANG
E IN THE KIDS.

IF YOU WALK THROUGH THESE HALLS,
AND YOU'RE HERE,

THESE DO NOT LOOK LIKE AT-RISK
, OUT-OF-CONTROL KIDS.

.
THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE BETTER

.
THEY SEEM TO BE MORE FOCUSED

TEACHERS WILL TELL YOU

THAT THEY GET MORE
OUT OF THEM IN THE CLASS.

Morgan: KEEP IN MIND,
THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE SCHOOL

THESE ARE THE "TROUBLE KIDS"
OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

IN APPLETON, WISCONSIN,
THAT ARE EATING SO WELL.

E
AND IT COSTS ABOUT THE SAM

AS ANY OTHER
SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM.

SO MY QUESTION IS --
WHY ISN'T EVERYONE DOING THIS?

There's an awful lot
of resistance

from the junk food companies

that make huge profits off
schools at the present time.

They don't want to get kicke
d out of the school system.

They want to be there to addic
t the children for life.

THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES,
ESPECIALLY, BOAST ABOUT

HOW THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO AMERICA'S EDUCATION,

BUT, IN FACT, WHAT THEY'RE DOING

IS THEY'RE DRAINING MONEY
FROM THE COMMUNITY

RATHER THAN CONTRIBUTING MONEY
TO THE COMMUNITY

BECAUSE THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES

AREN'T PUMPING THOSE DOLLARS
INTO THE MACHINES.

IT'S THE CHILDREN
IN THE COMMUNITY

WHO ARE GETTING THE MONEY
FROM THEIR PARENTS,

AND INSTEAD OF THAT MONEY
GOING DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION,

THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES
ARE TAKING A CUT OF IT

AND WALKING AWAY RICH
AS A CONSEQUENCE.

WE JUST BANNED SODA
IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT,

AND THE SUGAR HERE SHOWS YOU HOW
MUCH SUGAR A STUDENT WILL DRINK

IN A WEEK OF JUST SODA.

FORGET ABOUT
THE REST OF THE FOOD THEY EAT.

AND SOME OF THESE COMPANIE
S ARE REALLY OPPOSING THE BA

FOR REASONS OF
THAT WE WOULD LOSE REVENUE

IT'S NOT ABOUT ECONOMICS.

IT MAY BE SENDING A VERY
DIFFICULT MESSAGE FOR SCHOOLS.

ONE OF THE REASONS

THAT'S BEING CUT OUT SO
THEY CAN PREPARE FOR THE TESTS

TO A COUPLE OF GROUPS --

WE COULD END UP WITH YOUNGSTER

BUT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
REAL BAD TO HAPPEN, EITHER

Dr. Isaacs:
YOUR EKG IS NORMAL.

DEEP BREATH.

AND OUT.

NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE
A READY EXPLANATION

FOR YOUR CHEST PAIN.

WOULD YOU AT LEAST CONSIDER
TAKING ASPIRIN ONCE A DAY

NOW THAT YOU'RE
ON THIS RIDICULOUS DIET?

MAYBE.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT?

WHY WOULDN'T YOU
JUST DO IT?

THIS IS REALLY --
YOU KNOW --

YOU SAW
THESE NUMBERS, RIGHT?

THESE NUMBERS ARE
ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS.

FOR THE FIRST TIME,
WE'RE SEEING URIC ACID ELEVATED,

SO YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF
HYPERURICEMIA,

AND THE DANGER OF HYPERURICEMIA
IS GOUT, KIDNEY STONES.

THE RESULTS FOR YOUR LIVER
ARE OBSCENE

BEYOND ANYTHING
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

TRULY.

I MEAN...YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE
"DEATH IN LAS VEGAS" --

NICOLAS CAGE,
THAT PICKLED HIS LIVER

DURING THE COURSE
OF A FEW WEEKS IN LAS VEGAS.

I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT
YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING

WITH A HIGH-FAT DIET.

MY ADVICE TO YOU,
AS A PHYSICIAN,

IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
PICKLING YOUR LIVER.

AND YOU'RE KICKING IT
WHILE ITS DOWN NOW.

NOW IT'S DOWN,
AND YOU'RE KICKING IT FURTHER.

I MEAN, IF YOU WERE
AN ALCOHOLIC,

I'D SAY,
"YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

YOU KEEP DRINKING,
YOU'LL DIE."

IF THE PAIN STARTS TO RADIATE
TO YOUR JAW OR DOWN YOUR ARM,

THAT'S LIFE-THREATENING,
AND IMMEDIATELY SO.

SO I NEED TO HEAR ABOUT THAT,
OR YOU NEED TO CALL 911.

ALL RIGHT?

Alex: Hello?

Morgan: HELLO.

Hi, sweetheart.

HOW ARE YOU?

I'm good.
I'm worried about you.

YEAH.

I had no idea this was gonna be
such a dangerous experiment.

YEAH.

NK IT WAS GONNA BE THIS DRAST

AND HE'LL ADMIT ME IMMEDIATE
LY WHEREVER I AM.

Oh, sweetheart.

YEAH.

[ Sighs ]

I love you so much,
and I don't want you to be hurt.

YEAH, ME EITHER.

ME EITHER.

I'll tell you --
if you start to get nauseous

and you start vomiting
and your eyes turn yellow,

you have got to go
to the emergency room,

no matter where you are.

Again, if you're not
keeping food down

or you're feeling
sick to your stomach --

it looks like your
liver-function tests

are getting worse.

My suggestion would be
to stop the diet

and go back to eating
a lower-fat diet,

rechecking the blood tests
in a couple of weeks.

Thompson: NOBODY NEEDS TO BE
PARTISAN ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

WE NEED FIXES, WE NEED REMEDIES,
AND WE NEED SUPPORT.

Morgan: HOW MUCH INFLUENCE
ON GOVERNMENT LEGISLATORS

DOES THE FOOD
INDUSTRY HAVE?

THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS AN ENORMOUS
BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES.

THEREFORE,
IT EMPLOYS VERY EXPENSIVE

AND WELL-PAID LOBBYISTS,

AND THOSE LOBBYISTS ARE IN
WASHINGTON FOR TWO PURPOSES --

,
NUMBER ONE, TO MAKE SURE THA
T NO GOVERNMENT AGENCY EVER SAYS

"
"EAT LESS
OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

NUMBER TWO --

THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEVER PASSES
LEGISLATION THAT IS UNFAVORABLE.

AND I GUESS THE THIRD ONE
IS TO ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNMENT

TO PASS FAVORABLE LEGISLATION.

Morgan: THE GMA
IS ONE OF THOSE LOBBIES.

YOU'RE GOING TO SEE US DO
WHAT WE DO BEST,

AND THAT IS
MARKET APPROPRIATELY,

,
FINANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS

AS WE'RE DOING
IN A GREAT ABUNDANCE,

GETTING GOOD INFORMATION
OUT TO PARENTS

SO WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

THAT'S WHAT WE DO
IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

WE THINK THAT IS A RESPONSIBLE
, IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.

WE ARE NOT POLICE.
WE ARE NOT REGULATORS.

WE PROVIDE A SAFE,
AFFORDABLE ABUNDANCE OF FOOD

LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN.

THE FOOD INDUSTRY
AND THE BROADCASTERS

ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL LOBBIES
,

AND...THEY OUTGUN US.

THE INDUSTRY
HAS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE.

WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE.
WE WANT TO DO MORE.

WE RECOGNIZE
WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY.

.
WE'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION

WE'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM,

AND WE ALSO ARE PART
OF THE SOLUTION.

Morgan: DID EVERYONE HEAR
WHAT HE JUST SAID?

"WE'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM."

IS TAKING THE CRAP OUT

LISA HOWARD, MORGAN SPURLOCK
CALLING FROM NEW YORK.

PLEASE CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET THIS MESSAGE.

WE'D STILL LIKE
TO SCHEDULE AN INTERVIEW

.
WITH SOMEONE FROM McDONALD'S

PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

AND LET'S TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE.

,
[ High-pitched ]
YOU'LL NOT TALK TO ANYBODY

AND YOU'LL LIKE IT THAT WAY.

AFTER SIX MONTHS
OF DELIBERATION,

.
JUDGE ROBERT SWEET DISMISSED
THE LAWSUIT AGAINST McDONALD'S

THE BIG REASON?

THE TWO GIRLS FAILED TO SHOW

.
THAT EATING McDONALD'S FOO
D WAS WHAT CAUSED THEIR INJURIES

INTERESTING.

IN ONLY 30 DAYS OF EATING
NOTHING BUT McDONALD'S,

I GAINED 24 1/2 POUNDS,
MY LIVER TURNED TO FAT,

AND MY CHOLESTEROL
SHOT UP 65 POINTS.

MY BODY-FAT PERCENTAGE
WENT FROM 11% TO 18%,

STILL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

OF 22% FOR MEN
AND 30% FOR WOMEN.

I NEARLY DOUBLED MY RISK
OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE,

MAKING MYSELF TWICE AS LIKEL
Y TO HAVE HEART FAILURE.

I FELT DEPRESSED AND EXHAUSTED
MOST OF THE TIME.

MY MOODS SWUNG ON A DIME,
AND MY SEX LIFE WAS NONEXISTENT.

I CRAVED THIS FOOD MORE AND MORE
WHEN I ATE IT

AND GOT MASSIVE HEADACHES
WHEN I DIDN'T.

IN MY FINAL BLOOD TEST,

MANY OF MY BODY FUNCTIONS
SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT,

BUT THE DOCTORS
WERE LESS THAN OPTIMISTIC.

T
I WOULD VERY, VERY MUCH DOUB

THAT THESE NUMBERS
WILL RETURN TO NORMAL.

ALTHOUGH IT DID DROP,
IT WAS A SMALL DROP.

IF YOU KEPT ON THE DIET,
YOU'D DEFINITELY --

I KNOW THAT YOU'D PROBABLY
DEVELOP CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

.
...INFLAMMATION
AND HARDENING OF THE LIVER

SHOULD PEOPLE
EAT FAST FOOD?

NO.

YOU KNOW, THE ANSWER'S NO.

IT CERTAINLY NEEDS
TO BE VERY RESTRICTED

AND BALANCED WITH,
OVERALL, A HEALTHY DIET

AND, OVERALL, A LOT OF EXERCISE.

AND THERE'S NO REASON WHATSOEVER

WHY FAST FOOD
HAS TO BE SO DISGUSTING.

FAST FOOD CAN BE NUTRITIOUS.

IT'S A CHEAP FORM OF FOOD,

AND IT DOES KEEP YOU
FULL FOR A WHILE,

SO YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

BUT UNFORTUNATELY, YOU CAUSE
SOME MAJOR HARM TO YOUR HEART,

YOUR LIVER, YOUR BLOOD.

I WOULDN'T SUGGEST
YOU CONTINUE THE DIET

.
FOR A YEAR TO CHECK THIS OUT

I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE OR HEALTHY,

.
ESPECIALLY WITH
WHAT SHOWED UP WITH YOUR LIVER

Morgan: SO I SHOULDN'T EAT
THIS FOOD FOR A YEAR?

NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

,
WE SEE PEOPLE
WHO GO ON AN ALCOHOL BINGE

AND THEIR NUMBERS
GO UP LIKE CRAZY,

BUT TO GO ON A MAC ATTACK...

AND THEY'VE GOT NUMBERS TO SHOW
THAT IT ATTACKS YOUR LIVER, TOO.

HONESTLY, I WOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA,
IT DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE.

Morgan: STILL, THE IMPACT
OF THIS INITIAL LAWSUIT

.
IS BEING SEEN FAR AND WIDE

SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEW YORK
, TEXAS, AND SAN FRANCISCO

HAVE BANNED SUGARY SOFT DRINKS
IN SCHOOLS,

AND ALL-NATURAL, HEALTHY OPTIONS
ARE POPPING UP EVERYWHERE.

McDONALD'S JOINED RIGHT IN
, SPONSORING EVENTS

THAT SHOWED HOW HEALTH-CONSCIOUS
THEY'D BECOME

AND CREATING A NEW LINE
OF PREMIUM SALADS.

AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER,
THEY ALSO MASTERMINDED

ONE OF THEIR FATTEST
SANDWICHES TO DATE --

THE McGRIDDLE,
A PANCAKE-WRAPPED CREATION

THAT WON MY HEART IN TEXAS

BUT CAN PACK AS MUCH FAT
AS A BIG MAC

AND HAVE MORE SUGAR THAN A PAC
K OF McDONALDLAND COOKIES.

G
IN FACT, THEIR NEW PREMIUM RANCH
CHICKEN SALAD WITH DRESSIN

DELIVERS MORE CALORIES
THAN A BIG MAC

AND51 GRAMS OF FAT --

.
79% OF YOUR DAILY FAT INTAKE

,
OVER THE COURSE OF MY McDIET

I CONSUMED 30 POUNDS OF SUGA
R FROM THEIR FOOD.

THAT'S A POUND A DAY.

ON TOP OF THAT,
I ALSO TOOK IN 12 POUNDS OF FAT.

.
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

YOU'RE SAYING "NOBODY'S
SUPPOSED TO EAT THIS FOOD

"THREE TIMES A DAY.

NO WONDER ALL THIS STUFF
HAPPENED TO YOU."

BUT THE SCARY PART IS,

THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO EAT THIS FOOD REGULARLY.

SOME PEOPLE
EVEN EAT IT EVERY DAY.

,
SO WHILE MY EXPERIMENT
MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE EXTREME

IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY.

BUT HEREISA CRAZY IDEA --

WHY NOT DO AWAY
WITH YOUR SUPERSIZE OPTIONS?

WHO NEEDS 42 OUNCES OF COKE,
A HALF-POUND OF FRIES?

AND WHY NOT GIVE ME A CHOICE

BESIDES FRENCH FRIES
OR FRENCH FRIES?

THAT WOULD BE A GREAT START.

BUT WHY SHOULD THESE COMPANIES
WANT TO CHANGE?

THEIR LOYALTY ISN'T TO YOU
. IT'S TO THE STOCKHOLDERS.

THE BOTTOM LINE --
THEY'RE A BUSINESS,

NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY.

AND BY SELLING YOU UNHEALTHY
FOOD, THEY MAKE MILLIONS,

AND NO COMPANY
WANTS TO STOP DOING THAT.

IF THIS EVER-GROWING PARADIG
M IS GOING TO SHIFT,

IT'S UP TO YOU.

BUT IF YOU DECIDE TO KEEP
LIVING THIS WAY, GO AHEAD.

OVER TIME, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF
GETTING AS SICK AS I DID,

.
AND YOU MAY WIND UP HERE..

OR HERE.

I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION IS --

WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE GO FIRST,
YOU OR THEM?

RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE THE URGE
TO EAT SOMETHING.

WHEN IT'S THROUGH,
IF YOU STILL WANT TO EAT,

THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
REALLY HUNGRY.

THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING.

?? F.A.C., THAT IS ME ??
