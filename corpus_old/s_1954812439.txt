Hands in the head. - You do not need a gun.

Show me where my son. - Take a walk with me first.

If you ask me, I will kill you.

Do you kill someone feel better?

Revenge ... it does not work like that.

Vengeance is all I have. - Hold on a bit in this case.

One more thing. I have to tell my story to you on the road.

You kill me, you will never know what is.

Story began in the water.

I do not know what you know about surfing, but I'll tell you what I know.

The poor become rich every day in the Pacific.

I learned next to where I live in Sunset Beach, California.

Look at those idiots. They dip their Mexican uniforms.

Dad, they went bankrupt. - What does it cost to buy the rods?

Clearly a lot. - They can do nothing about the hidden.

They believe that the Pacific is the lake. - No, they do not respect.

Surprisingly that they take off shoes and socks.

Want to Mexico? - Shit Mexico.

Remember that ended with him. - Yes, but she knew that she was mine.

Hell! - Dad!

It is a family beach, stupid! - It? It used to be Mexico.

Not anymore.

We fight. Give me support.

Damn!

Come on!

Enter here!

If I die, I would have hit my brother.

To, Ben. - To, Jeanette.

I love you. - And I love you.

She was 16. - This is better than 14.

Kevy! Hello ...

How are you? - Can you breathe?

Go to hell. Tell the mother that she gets when I'm ready, okay?

Certain. Going out? - My neck has been broken! You're there.

This is not funny. - Sorry.

Look, I have trained a new trick and you get the picture.

You might have 10 minutes before emerging surf photographers.

You can contact Sam Mann Surfer Magazine. He likes the picture ...

I do not know, but maybe ... - good songs.

Make no see you before me there.

I'm not asking for anything special. I just want a livable wage.

Why do we employ them? They will not succeed.

It is okay. better we employ people at the regular price.

Until then I have to protect the company - you know it.

Jim.

I lost my home .... - I could lose my good.

Which of them? You've got five. - It's late, Trick.

Enjoy your spare time. In addition, a good wave in the street. I love you.

Fuck him. It is still the beach for.

You will help Kevy to pay the bills?

Come on.

What are you doing here? - How are you, Trick?

Are you not in the north where the money is? - Where's Ben?

Upstairs at Jalama. - Jalama?

Although I have to work. - Thank you.

How are you? Let us high. - Yes.

Kevy, hastily. There he is.

Should I do it for you? - I know what I'm doing. Silence.

Look. I got it the other day. - Good. Right either.

There he is. - No.

What? - Wait a wave.

So he came there, doing and turned around.

Kevy. - Photo, aku mengerti.

Good. - You can swear.

Dirt, which Ben! - Hell, you missed him.

Trick, asshole. - Too late, motherfuckers.

There it is. - Evy, the beach takes care of itself.

Want one? - No.

Buy a bottle of bubbles, but radiology extended.

We share here. It is pure gold.

So valuable, Kevy. - No, you can take it anywhere.

Attitude stillborn. - The waves come tomorrow too.

Meanwhile ... - Where?

Martys house will be demolished. - You do not have to go there, Trick.

I'm not going to miss the party. - Stay away from trouble.

We go! We go! - Cecil! Do not forget your skateboard.

This is not mine. - Ok, I sell them online.

Here. - Think about the installment of the mine detector?

Then they said, "Surely you can afford it." I have no problem with it, -

But once the house is now worth 850,000 dollars and possibly 4000.

Fire! They made me, I guess.

But you know what? Do they have a home so they can get it!

Exactly!

I love this place. John, wait! I'll take care of it.

It took three weeks to set up the dirt.

Look at this.

That is all!

I board here destroyed. - Dirt.

Only exist? - Yes, how many do you think?

$ -40. -40? I have 40 bags here.

Always. It smells good.

When can I pick it up? - I have a lot to do now.

It might help. - You know what? Your first line.

We'll see.

When was the same story again. - Mom wants everyone to see it.

No, that's just me.

Hi, honey. No surfing?

Wow.

Is Gerry? Some earn money somehow.

This is all I have. - Come on, you got it in two competitions.

Sometimes I want to surf without the crowds. - I understand.

You want to surf, make money ... - No, I want to surf when I want ...

-... With no one watching. - But if no one is watching, it has not happened.

Go to hell. - Come on, just two thousand.

That's all I have.

He will go to the Maldives. - Nothing is heard about him there.

I had to smoke this up, it's good.

Damn! I never get out of this cage.

You will be out on tour again. That is what you are good at.

There, please do. I do not see you go around the world.

I do not like you. I do not surf all the waves, only my own.

You are not ready for when you arrive.

I'll go with you if that is what is needed.

And do what? - I do not know. Everything you hate.

Pisse sponsoring down your spine pain ,, clean, real against the judge.

And when we go bankrupt? It is rigged. It is industrial and not waves.

Ben, we're all broke. We should go from here.

Is that Donna? - Looks like.

Who is he doing? - You let him go, remember?

Ben ... - Protect me.

Ben! To hell! Ben!

You just left me there with him. - Donna, what the heck!

God, Ben. I do not anymore. John, finally.

Relax. - Did he tell you wet?

Go to hell! John, he'll kill you.

Relax. Come on.

Tuhan, Ben...

You're dead, John. He has friends. Leave me!

Shit. My God, it went well?

Do not touch me. - I can get you wet. Come here.

Are you wet now? I love you! - Stop lying.

Lying me? - Ben, set me up. What are you doing?

I love you. - Yes, on Friday, but not on Sundays.

No, I love you always. - You like the others.

I miss you. - Do not say like that.

I got over you, let me not put me stuck here again.

Just drop me a bit. - No, I told the father that.

What should he do? Fuck! When he returned from Iraq, we were married.

Married? - Yes, damn.

Say it. - I love you.

No, says you have to get married. - I will marry you.

Are you serious? - I swear, I love you.

God ... Come here, baby.

I love you so much.

Are you okay? Whoa. Where did you learn to fight? In Malibu?

When someone beats you have to block. - The battle is always in its place?

They've been together since they were little. - Donna, is that ok?

Quiet, he took her home. I do you. He was a disaster.

He was my boyfriend. - She was the girlfriend of everyone.

That's what I mean. When you turn, you have to mean it.

Go to hell. - I'm just trying to help you, ok?

Will you beach minutes, should be the rule.

This is not your beach. - Yes, that's it.

Whether it is water, it is mine. Do inland, the pipe.

Cause he saw it, he was already dead.

Carrying weapons, for you can not fight.

Dad will love Donnas. - Yes, if he comes home from Iraq.

If you are going to get along with the tour, had to leave all of this.

Forget it. Everyone is in need of repair. "Johnnys mobile board repair."

You know the one in which Mexico? - Yes.

He belonged to a gang, El Rio Locos. - He does not fight like that.

But he wears the colors. - And?

Did they kill you for a girl who had been taken?

No ... I just borrowed it. She could have him.

What do you do with it?

Will you play a member of the gang now?

What? - I think you want to get out of here.

Jo. But now I do not know where it is.

It is not ok.

Tell Donna that I have benefited to Wainini if â€‹â€‹he rings.

What happened there?

What?

Benny Boy! It is time to stand up, ladies.

What is wrong with you? Come on! - Shit. This is the case, it's up to you.

What have you? - Dad!

This is a double gubbe there. - Please, tell me she was 18.

Shit.

We need to revive that way, see.

We need to revive it.

Is not he a little old to be playing with a hoop?

Think about her father seeing him now. - Say something.

He will not listen to me. My mother, not the father.

You little bastard.

Hey Jeanette. Apa kabar?

Hey taxes. - Can I tell the mother what?

Tell me what? - Mamma. We're getting married.

Ben, you change ever. - Come on, he loves her.

Ben, you hang well with Jeanette? - What?

No, that's not true. - He married me. Really?

Donna, sharpen. Ben, when did you do?

About four or five years. - You'll end up like a naughty girl.

What is needed in one to know one. - Three months and 14 days.

So we look at how you talk to me. - Dad comes home ...

... But then he was back then. Why he will not be with you?

Where you sleep tonight? For you do not sleep in my house.

Hell! You're kidding? It's ok, I have everything spot.

Here, taste. - Hey, you in the parking lot?

Okay, come and get me. I will call back. Yes, hurry up.

Wait! Donna!

Woman! - Tunggu, Donna.

Donna, wait! - Go to hell!

Donna, come here. What is wrong with you?

Go to hell!

Fuck her. - Yes, give me a beer.

Whether to fix a drink, so drink it himself.

God, I'm sorry.

Ben!

Do you go to Magoo? Ronnie says that he can bring us to the bottom.

It's better than this crap.

Ben!

Are you sleeping? Ben?

Ben!

Ben? Ben, bangun!

Ben!

Help! You there, call the emergency services!

Your Move. - Sorry.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ...

You worked well, children. - To the left.

Eight, nine, ten ... - You have been known to be here during the quarter.

Are you getting bored? - No.

Can we try? - You certainly do not give up?

We will do everything we can. - Okay.

Passed! One two three ...

Once again.

End. Well, you do well again? This is Ben. Kind, just once.

Once again, please! Again ... Please ...

John? John, menunggu.

Take this.

Rest in peace, brother.

We are all dead now. Not only is Ben.

What is this? - This is the other side of the power plant.

Sorry to interrupt again. - Do detective again?

Where are you when you are needed? - Dad, let him do his job.

I have some questions. - Come

I'll talk with John .. Join if you want.

It could swear, it was my home. - We have three murders ...

... Only in El Rio. All had been killed with a shot in the head like Ben.

Damn Mexican gangs.

Want something to drink? - No, thank you.

Should Ben relation to El Rio Locos? - No.

Is your lawn? - Not them.

My son smoke no grass. - Mom, she blows the grass.

Our son is in all the pictures, see. - And the green Honda Civic?

Do you remember the registration number? - No, I think not even on it.

Just talk to Donna. - He does not know his last name.

He knew he was definitely not good. They met on the beach.

This is nonsense. - Calm down, we spoke with Donna.

No, you do not. Not while the investigation is ongoing. Understand?

Ok, you have the names and the car. - You know how much the Civic here?

What are you talking about? With the technology, satellite and dirt ...

You can not find the damn car ?! - Yes we can.

But we have a plat or last name would help.

How much work on this? Only you, huh?

I get help detectives. - And what have you done? Nothing?

I was fired I did not do anything.

John, call me if you think of something. We will solve this.

When? Next month? Next year? - As soon as we know anything, we'll call.

I regret the loss.

No chance that I wait one year!

Johnny! Johnny!
Apa?

You need to shine. Your father talked about killing children of Mexico.

He spoke to everyone about it.

Are you okay? - Relax. Healey broke the drought.

Are you kidding, Gloomy? Thursday, two years ago.

Do you not think I say that? - Dad does not drink, he drowned.

He said he would go home and grab a gun and shot Miguel.

Do you have a weapon?

Dad?

What are you doing with my gun?

You know what we should do.

Mamma. - He was full. This ends now.

It is ok, you're afraid. Do not worry, this is the case.

This is not right, Dad. - You know what? Wish I was there ...

... I do not stand with hands in his pockets while my brother died.

I Asked always to Ben. - Ben needed no one did.

No, he was the golden boy. - What's wrong with you ?!

He is dead, and you're still jealous.

That is not true.

Daddy, stop! Please stop!

You never can take advantage of the problem page. Like when a big wave came.

What are you doing? You give it. You have no backbone. You do not have the ball.

I have. - Do You?

I'm going to kill that bastard. - You just said a full bar there.

My friends do not know. - Grim could not close his mouth.

To hell with Bleak! - You can not solve anything.

It is not even drunk. - You ...

You have to come with me because I was all you got. And You ...

How often went to the store and see pictures brother

In any surfing magazine checkouts?

I went there this morning and there she was. And I bought every magazine.

Do you know why, John?

For it will never happen again.

You have a tomb to cry.

Do you want one spit on, too?

John. - Good. If that is what you want, Dad.

Okay, I'll do it. I do it if that's what you want.

See? He must be a man.

You later, Mom? Is that what you want?

Eye for an eye.

Why did you do that?

You buried your brother, to the prize. You have to bury the bodies.

I still believe that my son's life. Tell me what's behind all the sand.

I can only show.

Are you crying yet?

Just as I browse.

Is this for my father? - Yes.

He called us.

Does my father called? - Yes, he was talking with my dad for a while.

He could not say where she was.

He did not call me. - Donna, it may not be time.

Father sent an e-mail.

"Sorry Dear." That's all she wrote.

I think that he was sorry for that he could not come to the funeral.

How to Miguel there? - Do not know.

Do not lie. I know that you did not tell the police everything.

No, I do not. I say nothing.

Miguel ring and say that you will meet.

God ... So stupid of me.

I think that at least you'll give me a hug or something?

Donna, I will.

No - John, I've seen your eyes.

You love me. You always love me. Ben has been told.

He said you were going to ask me out before he did.

This is not true. - Want to see my body?

Donna, stop! Your including Ben. You will always be his.

This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - We are friends. Just friends.

You know, you're not so tough. You'll fit you.

John ... you're just afraid to be in love with me and get your heart broken.

That's why you do not have no boyfriend. You scared.

You are not alone now, Donna. - I'm not ashamed of who I am.

I can touch you.

I could turn it off. But you certainly can not.

That's why you never touch anyone.

My way is better, so ... Call me if you want to know.

What happened?

It was the best I'd ever surfedag.

A day like this you forget everything.

I would not kill anyone. Not that day.

I would only be in the water.

Beautiful waves today, Mom.

I think that we can call the detective and told about Miguel.

Then he will be arrested.

The ...

And she was released on bail. - Yes.

So want to go to Mexico, for that is what they do.

No crime zone.

John. What happened, my brother?

Morning. - Council? Rincon tomorrow pump.

Yes. Here. - Good.

Thanks, man. - Does not matter.

Do you speak something about your cousin? - Transfer Listing every other Sunday.

If you ask how it is to sit in? - No waves.

So you are planning to take advantage of it?

No ... - Do not be taken.

Either way it's not so bad. He took the high school there.

They have scholarships.

I think you might use it again if I washed.

But it does not. - Mom ...

Give me your shirt. - I'm going to cry, but ...

... I was not able to finish. I would wake up and realize that it is more.

I love you.

"I do not belong."

What the hell do you want? - Wash Mom t-jersey I got ...

... When I find Ben. There was blood on the kitchen floor.

Dave has utility in the house.

This empty.

Wow.

It may be too low.

Do I get it? Thank you.

Here then? What are you thinking?

What are you talking about?

You know that.

It is probably too high. I do not want to fall.

Then here we go again.

There is a disk.

It is always a good choice.

What do you think?

I think so.

It might be our best option.

What? - There is a lot to take in

I love myself ..

I do not know what this means. - Yeah, so are you.

It is sick. - It is okay.

I see when you look at me and Ben. - What?

When you are in a garage on the couch.

We were with each other, and you stand there and then fight a long time.

I have to go now. - Do not go.

I loved it.

I like that you see us. I know do not know how to explain it.

But for the first time for a long time ...

... I feel like is not used.

God ...

god ...

There are so many empty houses. Where is everyone?

Inland. - I have to stay at sea.

Will I see you tomorrow? - If you call him?

Who?

God, Miguel? Is that what this is about?

Say that you will meet on the beach. - It is not that.

Yes, you can. You can get that at any time to do anything.

Not her. Do it now. - Donna, she killed my brother!

Did he really say that?

Let's just say you want to meet him in the parking lot noon.

So you stay away.

What are you doing to me? - What do you want.

Did you bring me? - Yes.

How long? - As long as you want.

Dad. Dinner is ready.

No steak.

Duduklah, John.

You can not kill him.

Surely you know? - Yes.

I know it. - Anything I say, I ...

I do not mean it. It was just talk, I do not mean it.

I love you, Daddy.

You are better than all of this, John. You are a good boy.

I think we could ledge brother by opening the surf school.

Ben Pipers surf school. We can get the kids out of town and teach them about the sea.

Here? - No.

Malibu or south where it's safe.

It is a good idea, Dad.

Ben had quite liked it.

What are you saying? What did you say?

Wow, forget it.

It is frightening how easy it is to kill someone.

There you will find ... when you're doing.

When the ball over my head.

How are you?

Wait and see. It was nothing, really.

Mom, what happened?

They come ... Donna and I.

Who? Is this Dad? - There is no danger.

Why do you have a weapon?

We solved it. I took care of it.

What do you mean? - That I shot Miguel.

Where? - In the parking lot.

Is he dead? - Yes.

I do not think I would be that, but I just.

Where is the father?

Poker di Scotty.
Baik.

I must say that before I signed. - No, not the police.

Yes, Mom. Police. - No, I will not be in jail.

I have lost one of you. - I must.

Why? So someone in there? - Yes Ma'am. I saw it.

I see it.

It is ok. You can cry now, Mom. You can cry.

Ben can rest in peace now. That may be what you want?

Okay! Good!

It's never good enough. You know what? Most proud Dad.

Donna attempted suicide today. - What?

Vicky found the diary, they quarreled and he was found bleeding on the floor.

Is he okay? - No, obviously she did not have it.

Listen. You can clear this before talking to Dad?

Yes, mother ... - I'm worried about Donna and me ...

-... Will go. I understand? - Yes, just seared.

Vicky! Let me in! - Sorry.

What are you doing?

I want no more children. - Run fast if you do not want Ã…ke into.

One can be inseminated. - Just run, Vicky.

I can have more children. - No, you can not ...

You are a terrible mother. As bad as I do.

Is It True? You are never more than Ben. It never felt better.

You just have to deal with it.

Why? - Because there is no cure without scars.

It was all of us. Two old scars to fat for our old jeans.

We have all been killed Donna. - That we did together.

Mom!

Mom! Dad! - Let him remain conscious for the first.

I am calm. - Why did you hit me?

Sit down.

What are you doing here?

Fast, Vicky.

What the ... - He does not get into the house.

But then he hit like if someone were to replace him.

He's going to kill himself, so ... - Tonight?

No... Juli 4.
No

Fast, Vicky.

He went to the beach, but then came Ben up full.

He laughed and teased and sang "This is where the bride dressed in white."

You know how fucking nasty he can be when he is drunk.

Do not blame it on Ben.

He will not kill him. It was an accident.

He sifted and weapons away.

You said you saw. That you see Miguel shot.

I see him go. - It's not the same, John.

What is the difference? We kept it in the family.

I'll call the police. - You did it, I cried assault.

We do it my way, Trick. - Dad, I shot the wrong person.

There is no danger, John. I finished it. I just need to be more aware.

I took care of arms and body. We do not need the police.

Vicky and I did it together to save our children, -

So please remember that we keep this between us.

Do not include me in the "we". I have nothing to do with this.

I killed him ... I killed him without further ado.

Where is Donna? - He's not here.

This is nonsense. - He is not here!

John! John, kembali! Neraka!

I'm going to grow hibiscus. - Where is the body?

Where was never found.

Have you thought about the river? All flushed up sooner or later.

But then too late. - You know what I would say.

When they catch you, John. Me too, and Donna and Vicky.

Maybe your father too. So just call.

Please, John. And when his mother would have spit on the grave ...

I would not blame him. - No, I killed the wrong man.

And everything else is just a bonus.

It happens to us all sooner or later. Welcome to the club.

You'll get over it.

Sorry, Dad. I'm not going to affect not, but I surrendered.

It is the right thing.

It takes balls.

I hope that you got them from me.

I will refresh me.

I have been long enough to know that changes one's life forever.

This is not what I want for you, but that's all it was.

The police did not come after you here. While you can learn something.

Donna sent a letter to me.

I'm not a hero. I was just there.

I do not see a lot of wars.

Honestly ... I saw everything.

Donna sent my diary before he killed himself.

I had the same day because they found her dead.

She is a good girl. - Thank you for coming.

Thank you.

Where is he?

His father home for burial tomorrow.

Eventually I will let her dirty hands as well.

Where is he? Everyone told me that she was a good girl.

Pretend it's true.

Who is it? - I do not know ...

... But Donna liked Mexico.

Hello.

I hear that your stay with Gerry. - How many bills.

Give me a minute, okay?

I want you to know that you can always go home.

I have no home.

I do not expect that you understand what I'm doing.

Not now, but one day when you have kids. If so, you may call me.

I will be a part of your life. When you come back.

Hey, Dad.

Hello. How are you? - Good.

I can take care of their hands. - Good.

Do you take painkillers for it? - No, I survived.

Yes, it's probably for the best. - Yes.

I have been aware for 287 days. Almost 10 months.

Is that true? - Yes.

Why are not you in Donnas it? - She and her mother ... you know.

I do not even know my wife. - Miguel's mother was at the funeral.

I'll tell you what happened. I know where he lives, Dad.

Where? In Mexico? - Malibu.

Donna knew it all along. He wrote in his diary.

Sounds like you'll be killed. - He deserves to know that, Dad.

Juan, I took off the rest of the day. Should fix something with my son.

I'll go with you. - No.

I support you. - I have to solve this problem alone.

I want to tell you that, so you know what I have in store.

Besides ... it must just be a fight.

Do not ask them for forgiveness, then you will not get.

Tell your story and ask them to listen. Do not start with what you have done, -

Without you and Ben. Tell all about Ben for them.

Tell the whole family. Tell about your mother and father demanding DIN

Which is a damn drunks who have no use for you.

Do it. Tell the whole story.

Then they came to do one of two things.

Do they kill you, or then leave you to the police.

It does not end in any other way.

And the story starts in the water, John.

Property Rivera. - Hey, I want to talk to Laura Rivera.

He did not receive visitors.

Can you tell him that I saw him at the funeral Donnas.

Moment.

Go ahead, come in - Thanks ..

She greets you here.

Do you want something? Mineral water? - No, thank you.

Sit down. Ms. Rivera soon.

Thank you.

If you make him angry? - No, I will not hurt him.

I know you do not. I asked if it would make him angry.

I just ...

Can I offer you something? - No, thank you.

You see my funeral certain Donnas. - Yes.

Are you a friend of Donna? - Yes.

I'm sorry, I do not know him well. She is a lovely girl.

He knew my son. - I know.

Do you know Miguel?

Ya.

He has been gone for almost a year. We have not heard from him. Do You Know?

Ya.

Do you know where he is?

I know what happened. - Happen? Is he alive?

How do you know?

I know, but not here. - Please, tell me now.

No ... I have to show you something.

I'll take you there and then informed.

I had to change.

Does he know anything? - Yes.

I can get it from him. - No, I'm going with him.

I joined. - No, I do not know what I should do.

You do not go with strangers. - Charles, he was not even here.

You are driving. Ms. Rivera sat in the back seat.

Donna did the right thing. She asked her mother to say where the body was.

It is here.

Only when the fence ... that they know that the sand will cause the crowd Up

And he will be buried.

Set my son buried here?

I ...

You will kill me how you want. Only I could see the sea.

There, look at me.

Look at me!

I want you to know who he is, so you know what you have taken from me.

I'll tell you about the day when he was born, but I was drugged.

I will tell about the first words, but I was in Paris with his glove

And she with their caregivers.

He played with the children in the street as if he is different from them.

I hate to see him play with them.

How can I protect him if he can not protect themselves?

Did you kill her? - Yes.

And mother, and Vicky, too? And left his body to rot in here-

And dumped his car in the river? Told you to be forgiven?

I do not know if it's possible. - Tell me what a good day for you.

What? - I will shoot you as you shoot.

But I will kill you in a better way. I will wait for a good day.

Maybe tomorrow.

Why kill you now that you are so depressed?

I will kill you when you have something decent life.

Then I'll find your mother, wife and your children.

And I will confess them as you did to me!

If you are lucky you die abroad. If you do not die on the day when you will live.

Do you revenge I can wait that long?

I think it can wait forever.

Go ... before I change my mind.

Five years later

Hey, Dad. I will, I will.

Man in gray suit could take you. Haier like small children.

Well said, Dad. Sheila, no beer whenever there for John?

It was a great day.

John, everything is fine. He noted in the water.

Yes, the ban on your feet.

Do you talk to your dad? He refused to speak to me.

He probably will not hit.

Tell him that he welcome when he wants to.

Do you feel good? Is that your hand?

Could not we have fun for one day at least?

It may be raining. - It's not a cloud in the sky.

I will listen to struggle in the car.

No, do not come here. John!

John, please, stay with us.

He had just returned from abroad. - Who are you trying to fool?

He was always like that.
