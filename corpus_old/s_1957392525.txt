[MUSIC STOPS]

Come on, sugar.
Help your mama out.

Everybody, that is

She's gonna be
a really big star one day.

Come on, sugar. Come on, baby.
Don't be shy. Come on.

You guys are

This little girl can sing.

Yeah!
All right.

Come on, y'all. Give her a hand.
Come on, come on.

That's my sweet pea.
Do it, baby.

Take your time, girl.

Anybody ever hands you a mike,

Told you she can sing, didn't I?

Y'all can do better than that!
Come on, come on, come on!

You remember what mama told you.
Mm-hmm.

What are you doing here, Lil?

Look, I got fired.
I can't even feed her.

I told you never to come by here.

She is your child too.

Billie!

Is there anyone inside?

Anybody inside?
[SIRENS WAILING]

I love you. Oh, god.
[ENGINE STARTS]

Come on.

I'm gonna have to say
good-bye to you, baby.

I don't know
how i'm gonna do that.

Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

I don't wanna go, mom.
I know, baby.

But I will come and get you
as soon as possible. I promise.

Okay?

I love you, Billie.

They're taking you away
just till I get better.

I don't have a choice.

I'm sorry.

<i>â™ª She was kind of fragile â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And she had a lot to grapple with â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But basically</i>
<i>she kept it all inside â™ª</i>

I think you'll feel
at home here.

[KIDS CHATTERING]

Welcome to Eaglebrook.

Billie, come on over here
with me for a moment.

Look, Louise. There's a new girl.

Okay, baby, you stay here.
I'll be back in a minute.

You Puerto Rican?
I'm mixed.

This one here's Puerto Rican.
I'm Latin.

I'm Louise. This is Roxanne.

What's your cat's name?
Whisper.

Can I pet it?
Yeah, sure.

He's so cute.

<i>â™ª Dear God</i>
<i>It's all so tragic â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll never have</i>
<i>the chance to feel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The closure that</i>
<i>I ultimately need â™ª</i>

â™ª [DISCO]


Shouldn't have worn leopard tonight.
Whatever, it's leopard night.

So what are we supposed to do?

How y'all doin'?

Good.
Fine.

I was watchin' y'all out there.
Y'all looked pretty good.

Well, you know, we try, we try.
Thanks.


Y'all sing?
Yeah, mm-hmm.

A little bit.
Dance.

I do the choreography. She does... wardrobe.
Some of the choreography.

Everything.

Okay.

We might have to tone your look down
a little bit, but y'all wanna be in a group?

Like a singing group?

Yeah. A little dancing
in the background.

That's good. That's good, baby!
I'm cool with that.

Yeah, I'm feeling it.
When you wanna start?

You know what? Right now
we're actually doin' our own thing, so...

Thank you,
But we're a little bit busy.

You got Timothy Walker in your face, girl!
I don't get it!

I know it's crazy.
Whatever.

Most people would be dying to get
some respect from somebody like Timothy Walker.

Okay? right. And you--
The broke bitch!

The broke bitch!
You know what?

You really wanna sing backup for that freak?
Hell yeah!

I'm sure she can really sing.
I didn't say all that. She can't sing.

You have an amazing gift,
and you gotta use it.

Your mom's gave you this gift.
What?

Why would you bring up my mom?
there you go, doing that--

I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
We need the money.

And you know we need the money.
Hey, hey, hey.

Please, Billie, please.

All we gotta do is stand in
the background and go, "Ooh, ooh."

Or however it go and get paid.

Come on, please. We gotta do this.
Please, Billie, please!

You gotta do this. We need it so bad!
All right! Stop! Okay!

<i>â™ª I've been waiting on someone</i>

Bring Billie all the way up.

â™ª You and only you can

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

Here's the single Sylk's gonna
be performing tonight, man.

Who's this?
Sylk, man. You know her.
Timmy's girlfriend.

This is Sylk?

Boy, this don't sound like Sylk.

She must've been puttin' some
hours in with a vocal coach.

Fresh, right? Fresh.
Whoo!

â™ª ["ALL MY LIFE"] â™ª

Let's hear it for Sylk!

â™ª I've been waiting for someone

Did you really like it?

Sylk, I had no idea
you could blow like that.

I had no idea you were so interested in
how good I could blow.


Could we get out
of here? Please.

<i>Hold it, girls. Can I take a photo</i>
<i>of the four of you?</i>

Oh, yeah. Oh, you don't need them.

Can I talk to you for a second?

Excuse me, ladies,
But I gotta talk to her.

That was you singing, right?

Man, I knew it.
I knew it wasn't Sylk.

He's been ghosting you.
What do you mean, ghosting me?

Using your voice for Sylk's.

But I'm having a good time, so--

Hell no. Hell, you
can't let him do that.

You have got a beautiful voice.

You can't let Timothy
use the best of you.

What makes you think
that's the best of me?

There's-- there's more?
There's better?

I want some of that.

Hey, what's your name?
Billie.

I'm Dice, like Lucky Seven.

I know who you are.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah. I've heard
a lot about you, Dice.

Well, listen, don't believe
everything you hear.

Okay.
Come with me. I wanna show you something.

Come on. Let's go. I'm not gonna bite you.
Where we going?

People in the house, say "Yeah"!

All right, everybody,
You know what time it is now.
The beats are coming at you.

When the microphone comes,
don't be scared, a'ight?

I want you to do somethin' special.
You can freestyle.

You can sing. Hell, you can
make love to the DJ if that's your thing.

So come on and let's get it on!

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>All right, y'all!</i>

Feel the groove. Here we go.
Come on, come on, come on.

â™ª Yo, yo, come on â™ª

â™ª To the beat, y'all
to the beat, y'all â™ª

â™ª I go on and on
and on and on â™ª

â™ª The beat don't stop
till the break of dawn â™ª

â™ª I dip, I die
I socialize â™ª

â™ª Come on, girl
let's rock this dive â™ª

All right, all right,
next, next, next!

Feel it. Oh, feel it.
Come on.

<i>Over here! yo, yo, yo!</i>
<i>Show me some love!</i>
<i>Show me some love!</i>

â™ª Like Eliot Ness
I rhyme the best â™ª

â™ª I'll come rip the "S"
off of Superman's chest â™ª

â™ª Yes, yes, y'all
beat, beat, y'all â™ª

â™ª You don't quit 'cause I'm one
of a kind about to rock your mind â™ª

â™ª Don't get too close
to my fine behind â™ª

â™ª Unless you're my man
'cause then you can â™ª

â™ª 'Cause me and my man
got the master plan â™ª

Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

â™ª Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh â™ª

Give me the best of you.

â™ª I feel it â™ª

â™ª And I like it
in the beat â™ª

â™ª You're making fun
that's what it was â™ª

â™ª Oh, I'm gonna get into you â™ª

Whoo!

Let me tell you something.
I meet singers all the time,

But I ain't ever met
anybody like you.

You really got
something special.

Is this how you, like, try and soup
girls up to get what you want?

I don't soup girls up.
Really?

Really.
Look, I know you're
a fly DJ and everything,

And I should be honored
that you wanna work with me,

But, I mean, I'm just not into the games.

I'm not playing games.
I'm serious.

All right, look, what's
the biggest dream you've ever had?

I don't know.

How about playing
Madison Square Garden?

Yeah, right.

If you want that, and we work
real hard, we can get it.

I want to produce you.
What about Timothy?

I mean, I don't need
any problems.

Don't worry about Timothy. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

So what do you think?
We got a deal?

Yeah.

You're not gonna regret this,
I'm telling ya.

Listen, I gotta go back inside.
How can I reach you?

You're Lucky Seven, right?

You'll figure it out.
Hmm.

Hey, buddy.

The Dice Man.
Hey, T.

What's happening?
Can I talk to you?

So what's happening, daddy?
I'm good.

Listen, um--

I want Billie and the girls.

Yeah, man, I can't do that.
You know how much that's gonna cost me?

You're talking about redoing
the album covers...

And clothes and rehearsals
and studio and all that.

Nobody's looking
at the backup singers, T.

Nah, nah, I can't do it.

I think you can do it.
Really?

Uh-huh, if you want your
artists heard in this club again, you can.


You're serious about this.

Okay.

Look, man, you're gonna
have to reimburse daddy.

How much?

One hundred thousand.

You must be smoking dust, T.

Yeah, and it's
really expensive too.

A hundred large.

Yes. It's like that now.

Hm.

â™ª

Uh!

What do you think?
I like it.

â™ª Let you take me out â™ª

<i>â™ª I knew what you</i>
<i>were all about â™ª</i>

â™ª But when I did â™ª

â™ª I wasn't tryin' to lead you on â™ª

â™ª Now you bring me home â™ª

â™ª And tell me good night's
not enough for you â™ª

â™ª I'm sorry, baby â™ª

â™ª I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª

â™ª Da da da di di, baby â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª

â™ª [VOCALIZING] â™ª

â™ª Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª

â™ª I di-di-didn't, baby â™ª

â™ª I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª

Whoo!

â™ª I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª

â™ª I didn't, baby â™ª

Oww!

â™ª [VOCALIZING] â™ª


Yo, Dice Man.
Hey, Martin, what's up?

Excellent. Good to see you, man.

Great show.
Thank you. How you doin'?

Excellent. Are you
signed yet, Billie?

Signed like a record contract thing? No.

Gary here would love to
bring you in his new label, Tuff Ride.

How you doin'?
He just signed Chili D.

Well, we're kind of considering
a lot of different things at the moment.

You know, we're keeping our options open.

Sure, man, okay. That's great.
Keep your options open. That's important.

Nice shirt, man.
Thank you.

Listen, anything you need,
you just let me know, okay?

See you later, Martin.
Take care. good to see you.
Nice meeting you.

<i>Yeah, you too. See ya.</i>

What are you doing? That guy wanted
to sign us. You crazy?

Tuff Ride?
Whatever.

I mean, it's a label. It's a deal.
It's a good label.

All you need is to strap on
some leather chaps,

Have a couple horses with you, run
around with a whip, going, "Yahoo."

That's great.
Whatever. I mean, come on.

I mean,
It's a record company.

EMI, CMZ, Warner Brothers.

They're the labels
that I'm talking about.

Okay, but--
You deserve the best, and
that's what you're gonna get.

I hope you're right.
You gotta trust me.

â™ª

Here you go.

Hey, what's going on?

Hi.
Guy Richardson from CMZ is here.

CMZ is hitting hard on the dance charts.

You need to go over and give 'em a shout.

Do me a favor.

All right? Come on.

Call me if you like it.

<i>â™ª Let you take me out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I knew what you</i>
<i>were all about â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But when I did â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I didn't mean to turn you on â™ª</i>

Mr. Richardson.
I'm Dice.

I know who you are, man.
This is Jack Bridges, head of A&R.

Hey, Jack.
How you doin', Dice?

This is my latest track.
Oh, yeah?

And this is the singer,
Billie Frank.

Hi.
Well, hello.

Jack Bridges.
Hi.

Who else did you give this to, man?

Oh, it's getting heard.
Well, look.

Stop in tomorrow afternoon,
all right? Can you do that?

I'll make sure everybody
at the label hears it in the morning.

No sweat.
That's quite a voice you've got.

Thanks. Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.
See ya.


Okay, now remember, these guys,
they're just the body.

We're the soul, right?
They need us.

They need you.
No. They need us. We go together.

Don't forget that.

<i>Billie, Dice,</i>
<i>glad you guys are here.</i>

Listen, I played the demo
for the team this morning.

Everybody flipped. Come on.
They're all dying to meet you.
Hey, everybody.

This is Tom. He's in charge
of record promotions.

Jane, our image consultant.

Dice, I believe you already know Bennett.
Hey, boss.

This is all the courtesy
of Mr. Richardson.

He couldn't be here today.
He's in L.A.

He is so thrilled that you're gonna
join the family, Billie.

I think you'll be happy here.

Well--
Here's to you.

Dice, Billie, my friends,
this is just the beginning.

He's here!
Okay, I gotta go.

No! I'm not finished yet.
I gotta do your makeup.

I do this great, dramatic first-date eye.

It's not a date.
Yeah, right.

It is a date. Smile, smile.

Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Well, that leaves nothing.

Exactly. So don't you be
getting all freaky on the first date.

It's not a date!
Yes, it is a date!

I gotta go. You're making me late.
It's a date!

It's a date, date, date. Y'all know that.
Date!

Courtesy of CMZ.

Whoo! We're on our way, baby!


Oh, you look beautiful.

Thanks.
This is for you.

Watch your step.

Just one moment, please.
Hey, Mikey.

Come on in.

Hi.
Hey, how are you?

How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?

Good.
How's business?

Business is good.
Business is good.

The chef's prepared something
just the way you like it, and...

A bottle of your favorite.
Beautiful. Thanks.

Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.

Why'd you get me a rose?

I just thought it'd be something nice.

It's a rose, what?

No. It's just that, you know,
It's a single red rose,

And you picked me up
in a limo,

<i>And you got</i>
<i>all that cologne on.</i>

So I just--
I was just wondering.

Wondering what?

Is this a date?

No. This is not a date.

If this was a date,
then you'd know about it.

Oh, okay.
Here.

Thank you.

What's this?
Oh, this is escargot.

Snails. It's like a French delicacy.

So somebody went all the
way to France for this?

Okay.

I like hanging out with you, Billie.

To us.

To us.

<i>I gotta pick something up.</i>

<i>You wanna come up for a minute?</i>

<i>Uh, no.</i>
<i>Why not?</i>

<i>Because I know you just</i>
<i>wanna get me up in your house.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

Stop being so paranoid.

I'm not being paranoid.

Just come up for five minutes.
That's all.

Five minutes.

Three.

Ah, there we go.

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

What do you think?

Very nice.

After you.

Is this you?
Yup.

So cute.
Oh, thanks.

What happened?


You're funny, yeah.

You play?
Yeah. I think it's,

You know, really important as a producer
to be able to play.

Like one of my favorites,
Quincy, Quincy Jones,

Oscar Awards, Grammy Awards.
He started as a musician.

What's this, like a xylophone,
like in kindergarten?

Similar to the xylophone,
but a little different.

This is actually called a marimba.

It's one of my favorite instruments.

Can you move down a little, please?
Thank you.

â™ª [JAZZ] â™ª

I like it a lot.

<i>â™ª Who â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Would've believed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That you and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Would fall</i>
<i>and land together â™ª</i>

You know,

I don't do this.

Yeah.

I can tell.

I'm just jokin'.

Thanks, jerk.

Look, What I wanted to say is that...

You're- you're different.

You don't have to say that because we just
slept together, you know.

That-- that is-- That's so romantic,
you know.

Really, really beautiful.

I just have
a little bit of trouble, um,

Trusting people, you know?

I understand that.

<i>â™ª I found myself reborn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On the day I met you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if we move closer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then love will take over â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And lead â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby</i>
<i>uh-huh, uh-huh, baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoo â™ª</i>

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

<i>[DICE] Nah, there's</i>
<i>too much going on.</i>

Lose all the superfluous shit.

There you go.

Now, you sing this
as you would sing this.

All right?
Forget all of that.

Okay.
Okay, good.

<i>We got the Dice Man, aka Lucky Seven,</i>

<i>With a young lady who gonna</i>
<i>be makin' much, much noise.</i>

<i>Remember the name, Billie Frank.</i>

<i>Yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out.</i>
Hey, turn it up.

Turn it up.
I can't believe this.

Where you going?
What are you doing? Wait!
[HORNS HONKING]

What are you doing?
[TURNS UP VOLUME]

Whoo!

What are you--
Her song's on the radio, man!

Gimme a dime. Gimme a dime.

Hurry up. The song's gonna be over.
Gotta call Roxy and Louise.

[HORNS HONKING]
Pull over.

Can I use this phone
really quick?

Come on, let her use the
phone. She's on the radio.
Thank you.

That's her? Can I get
an autograph or something?

I ain't got a pen, baby.
[LINE RINGING]

I can't believe it.
Roxy, put the radio on right now.

92.3. I'm on the radio.

This is it, Billie! Oh, my god, you're on
the radio right now, baby!

Here, talk to Louise!
Billie, Billie!

Whoo!

Hold on a second.

We can hear you, Billie.
You sound so good!

I'm on the street.
I'm gonna call you back, okay?
We'll call you back.

Love you back.

<i>â™ª K-I-S-S-I-N-G â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby</i>
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby â™ª</i>

<i>[MAN]</i>
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

<i>[BELL RINGING]</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>

Please. no, Look.

This is not working. The glitter can't
overpower the artist.

<i>Okay?</i>
<i>Could we clean this up?</i>

Okay, we ask ourselves,
"Is she white, is she black?"

We don't know.

She's exotic. I wanna see
more of her breasts.

Flamenco.
Shake, shake, shake.

Shake your chi-chi. Just shake
your chi-chi.
No. No.

<i>Come on, just shake it.</i>
<i>These dancers are a joke.</i>

Please. Some strippers, at least.

Shake that.
When you shake it, shake it.
Come on. Shake it.

Look, you can't even shake.

<i>[CHATTERING CONTINUES]</i>

We gotta lose her friends,
the two girls.

Roxy and Louise?
Those are her dancers.

The director wants other dancers.
He's got his own vision.

His own vision?

This is a major director,
Dice, all right?

I'm just trying to be a professional.
I ain't doing this shit.

The producer over there likes me.

<i>What? I can't believe this.</i>
Where are they?

They're home. They're cool.
Look, I promise they'll be on the next one.

Well, I gotta go talk to somebody
because this is not good.

All right!
Time for the unveiling!

Oh, you are the only one
who could pull this off.

Show me the-- the--
Yes! That's it!

<i>- That's exactly what I want.</i>
<i>Can I have this, please?</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

Can you please go find the director
and say something to him...

'Cause I'm really not happy.
Okay. Kurt!

It's very futuristic.

Flames don't walk. They flicker.
You're joking.

Are you sure about this outfit?
Because I don't really know.

Yes. I know how to do my job.
Okay? Sex sells.

She's hot, and that's how
you sell records, my friend.

What I'm saying is,
it's not like fire--

It doesn't walking,
it flicker more.

Or, like, have you
seen fish swim?

In a school. Tell them, go to them
and move your hands.

Hello, Billie Frank.
It is such a pleasure to meet you.

I'm Kelly. The label hired me
to be your publicist.

Nice to meet you. This is Peter,
My assistant.

Nice to meet you, Billie.
We are so excited to get started.

This must be the infamous dice. Hello.
How are you?

I'm Kelly, the new publicist. This is Peter.
Nice to meet you.

We've got a full day
planned for you tomorrow.

At noon we have a photo shoot.
I don't like to do photos before noon.

We want you to look fresh.
At 3:00, We have an interview
with <i>Music Beat</i> magazine.

Hip cool.
It was a real coup.

After that, radio interviews--
5:30, 6:00. I don't want
to do anything after 6:00,

Because you miss drive time,
and good-bye record sales.

Okay, thank you very much for your visit.
Lady and guy, you have to get out now.

Okay, we'll wait there.
I've got 5,000 calls to make.
It's great to meet you.

Great to meet you too. Have a good shoot.
You look great.

Love that eye shadow.
What is that, Pewter? Fantastic.

Bye.
Bye.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I got myself a lover</i>
<i>Who knows what I like â™ª</i>

That's right. Burn, my friends, burn.
Come on.

â™ª [CONTINUES] â™ª
<i>Guys, the flames are</i>
<i>licking up her body now. Okay?</i>

And around her breasts.
Come on.

<i>Now shake her on fire.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

<i>Nice, nice, nice!</i>
Hold it! Cut!

[BELL RINGS]
Cut? Who called cut?

I called cut! I called cut!
Can you not see? These guys are all over her!

Could somebody get this guy
off the set, please?
Listen to me.

Have you not got eyes in your
head? She's not comfortable.
Get rid of this guy.

She's not--
You wanna take--

Take your hands off me.
You're overreacting, man.

Take the loss on this one.

Billie... come on.

Are you sure?
I'm sure. Come on.

Now I'm overreacting.

<i>You're makin' a big mistake, man.</i>

[CAR HORN HONKS]

You know, I still think
we should go back.

What are you talking about?
I don't think we should've
walked out like that.

They gotta know they gotta treat you right.
It's only my first video.

I don't want to get a bad reputation.

All right. I'll call Richardson.
I'll straighten things out.

Thanks.

<i>Look, I'm sorry about</i>
<i>The video, okay?</i>


I just can't believe they
disrespected us like that.
I can. I hated it.

The whole thing was whack.
No, you guys were good. It's not that.

It's just that the label
makes these decisions.

You're like my family.
I don't want to lose that.

Me neither.

[SUCKS LIPS] What? What?
Nothin'.

Maybe you could put me
in a music video every now and then...

So I could showcase my sensuality.
All right, Roxy.

Look, you guys wanna go shopping?
Oh, yeah!

<i>â™ª I can't help myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't want nobody else</i>
<i>to ever love me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You are my shining star</i>
<i>my guiding light â™ª</i>

<i>Uh-huh. yeah, look,</i>
<i>don't give me your crap.</i>

Hey, Billie, hi!
I'll call you later.

Billie! Hello, darling.
Hi.

I need you to sign off on these photos.
Okay. Hi.

The magazine deadline is today.
Hi. Here you go.

That's cool.
These are all we could salvage
from that video shoot,

But I think we've got something here.

I want to take away from this street
urchin, sassy, sexy, slutty thing.

What are you wearing?
What? It's a shirt that I tied behind me.

<i>Why? Never mind. I don't wanna know.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get you out of those jeans...</i>

<i>And into something a lot classier-
Maybe haute couture.</i>

That's good.
She looks amazing.

Yeah, if you like Titsy the Porn Star.
Porn star?

I'm just saying that
this is not right.

So we gotta redo the shoot,
and we gotta lose the--

panties in a bunch, okay?

<i>No. We have been hired</i>
<i>by the label to conceptualize</i>
<i>Billie's new look.</i>

All right? Don't worry.
She's in the hands of professionals.

I'm goin' for a smoke.

Beautiful.
Do you like that? Oh, no, no, no!


You<i> don't look like a man</i>
<i>on top of the world.</i>

In fact, you look a little worried, bro.

I'm all right.

Well, just remember, whatever it is,

It could always be worse, you know.

What you doin' here, T?

Layin' down this track with Sylk.

Boy, you're determined
to make that girl famous.

Yeah, well, Come in here, daddy,
and let me show you what your money's buyin' me.

â™ª [DISCO] â™ª
â™ª [VOCALIZING] â™ª

What you doin', bro?
These broads can't sing.

Yeah, well, was that bitch
worth a hundred thousand?
Why she gotta be a bitch?

I need my money.

â™ª [CONTINUES] â™ª

Are you hungry?

No.
You got food in your crib?

Always.
Well, when you run out,
come see me,

'Cause this was a bullshit deal
and you know it.

So it's like that now, huh?
Yeah. It's like that.

Yeah, I'll see ya soon.

Don't look.
Oh, okay.

Ready? Okay.
Yeah, I'm ready.

You go straight.
Okay. You're scaring me.

Don't be scared. Go.

You're not gonna walk into anybody.
Go left right here. No, no. Right here.

Right?

Okay, and sit.

Ooh.

Open your eyes.

Oh, man.

You like it?
Do I like it?


I can't believe that--
This is one of my fa--

This is beautiful, man.
Isn't it cool?

â™ª
It has all different sounds--
Strings, horns, all that.

Pretty cool.

Nobody's bought me anything before.

Thank you.

What are you thinking?

Nothin'.

Come on.
What are you thinking?

Do you come along with this DX7?

What?

I mean, like, you know,
half your clothes are here anyway,

AND space really isn't a problem,
and I just think--

Is that your romantic way
of, like, asking me to move in?

I'm just saying that--

That, you know, maybe we should--

I think it would be nice
to spend more time together.
Okay.

<i>We're very open with each other,</i>

And like I say,
most of your things are here anyway,

And--
I said okay.

You said okay?
Yeah.

Okay.

Hey.

What's wrong?

I found a box of my mom's things.

This was hers.

She always wore this. I don't think I ever
saw her without this on.

I never told anybody
this before,

But, um,

I've had this recurring dream
since she gave me up.

It's kind of embarrassing,
but-- [CHUCKLES WEAKLY]

Tell me about it.

Well, I'm on this huge TV show, right?
Mm-hmm.

And I'm singing this song...

That me and my mom
used to sing together.

And she's watching,

And she realizes that it's me...

And...

that I made it, and it's like
a part of her made it.

You know?
'Cause she's in me.

And she's got this look on her face.

Like she's proud?
Yeah.

But it's- it's more.

It's like she wishes
she never gave me up.

I'm sure she does.

She probably thinks
about it every day.

Yeah. So do I.

We have a record here of your mother
Lillian Frank...

Uh-huh.

Moving from a Jackson Heights address,
uh, ten years ago.

Okay.

Hm.

I'm afraid our records are,
uh, incomplete after that.

Incomplete?
We have no current information on her.

Well, what do you mean? I thought you
were supposed to keep track of people.

It's an imperfect system,
Miss Frank.

Records are destroyed,
people disappear.

<i>Look, um, I-I have all</i>
<i>your information,</i>

<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>I'll keep digging around,</i>

<i>See if we can't locate her.</i>

Miss Frank, are you okay?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Sure.

â™ª [FUNK] â™ª

[MUSIC STOPS]
How you doin'?

Hi. Good to see you.
Nice to see you, Billie.

Dice.
How you doin'?

Good to see you.

We just thought we'd stop by and see how
the new stuff's comin'.

That's cool. We got some great new songs.
Yeah.

Listen, we don't want to pressure you,
but we gotta get the album out...

While the single's still hot.
We finally got knocked out of the top spot.

Ten weeks at number one.
That's not a bad run.
That's true.

That's pretty good.
There are a lot of great
producers out there now.

What are you saying?
I'm saying, there are a lot
of great producers out there.

We need to find a way to get a dance song
out there that'll cross over to the pop charts.

<i>Listen, all you need is a hot dance duet</i>
<i>With somebody big.</i>

I guarantee you it'll cross over.
I guarantee it.

You got anything
we can hear right now?

Sure, why not?
We're working on it. It's not... done.

â™ª [DANCE] â™ª

<i>[MAN ON RADIO]</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

<i>This is Randy.</i>
<i>[CONTINUES, INDISTINCT]</i>

<i>[Billie]</i>
<i>So how was the meeting?</i>

Not good.

Why?

They didn't like one song.
That's impossible. What did they say?

They said that they wanted
you to cross over...

and that everything sounds
exactly the same.

Everything doesn't sound the same.
What about the song I wrote?

That was, they didn't dig
the "woe is me" type thing,

and, you know, this is the '80s
and everybody wants to dance.

"Woe is me"?
What the hell is that?

I don't know.

They also want you to work
with other producers.

Well, I'm not gonna work with anybody else.
Baby, you got no choice.

Look, you sing your ass off on this album,
it's gonna go platinum,

And we call the shots
on the next one, okay?

Well, what about you?

I'm cool.

I been writing some things anyway.
This'll just give me a little more time.

<i>â™ª Tell me, baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why are we apart â™ª</i>

<i>And they want us there now?</i>
<i>That's great.</i>

Oh, my God.
B, It's confirmed.

They want you to do
the U.S.A. Music Awards.

<i>[PETER] Can you believe this? This is huge.</i>
It's great.

Great? It's fantabulous.
They want you right away at rehearsal.

They want me now?

Yes. Driver, Take us to Broadway and 52nd.

Okay, can you call Dice for me
and ask him to meet us wherever it is?

I'll call him later.

We gotta figure out
what you're gonna wear for the event.

<i>It's gotta be fantastic. Gina</i>
<i>wants you to wear that red</i>
<i>sequinned thing. I don't know.</i>

I'd rather that thing--
The pink thing with the boa.

The pink thing with the boa.
Yes.

<i>[DICE]</i>
<i>One, two, eh, eh.</i>

â™ª [JAZZ] â™ª

He says that he can't make it,

Did he say why?
Oh, yeah. Something about a meeting,

Or maybe he's out beating
somebody to a pulp, or whatever he does for fun.

Just kidding!

Okay.

Oh, there's Billie Frank.
Let's see if we can get a quick word with her.

<i>[MAN 1]</i>
<i>Who's the guy, Billie?</i>

<i>[MAN 2]</i>
<i>Can we get you alone?</i>

<i>Hey, Billie,</i>
<i>Can we grab a couple--</i>

Roxy! Billie on TV!
Come here!

So what'd you think of the show tonight?

I thought it was great.
I'm just happy to be here.

Rumor has it that--
We gotta go. Thanks.

Places to go, people to see.
That, of course, was Billie Frank.

Talkin' on the TV now! [GIGGLES]
Yeah!

What about this for the party?
You look like a disco ball.

But I like the gold.
It goes with the hoops.

It's too much, okay? Please.
But it's a party.

Go change. Hurry up, hurry up.
But I--

<i>...At the Capitol Club, apparently the</i>
<i>hottest ticket in town.</i>

Yes!
Okay, this is better.
This is definitely better.

We have to go.
Hurry up! Come on!

Fine, I'll lose the scarf.
I look better without it anyway.

It shows more of what I got.

That's what I wanna show.
Fine. Eek! Fine.

Okay, let's go! I been waitin'!

â™ª [WOMEN VOCALIZING] â™ª


They fed you good. Oh!

Did you guys watch it?
Oh, you were so good!

<i>Billie. Billie,</i>
<i>I'm Jim Damien.</i>

Hi.
I'm a movie producer and a huge fan.

I'd love to put you into a movie.

Wow, thank you. This is Dice.

He's my producer and my boyfriend.
Hi.

It's great to meet you. One of my
biggest dreams is to score for movies.

Maybe some day you will, Deuce.

As I was saying, have you
thought about acting?

Um, not really.
[KELLY] she'd be great in the movies.

<i>Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>
<i>Uh, Billie?</i>

There's someone here
who is dying to meet you.

Okay.
Come on.

Things are going okay?

Everything's going great.
You sure?

I think you're gonna love
this surprise. Yeah.
Yeah?

Oh, I'm a-- I'm a big fan.

You're a big fan? Of mine?
Yes.

Yes!
You gotta be kidding.

I'm a big fan of yours. Please!
Thank you.

You, I mean, you were
incredible tonight.

Thank you, thank you.
You-- Oh, my God. Your voice.

It's incredible.
Thank you.

Have you written any of your own stuff?

Yeah, but, I mean,
no one's ever heard any of it.

Oh. Well, maybe we should
get together-- do something.

I'd love that. Yeah.
You think so?

Hey, I'm Dice.
Hey, what's up, man? How you doin'?

I like your stuff too.
Oh, thank you.

Yeah. Maybe, uh,
we can all do something.

Yeah, we should do that.

Actually, I'm kind of busy at the moment.
I'm doing something with Quincy.

Oh, really?
What are y'all workin' on?

It's the early stages.

I don't really like to talk about it.
You know how that is.

Yeah, okay.
Well, good luck with that.

And, um,
you're a very lucky man.

Heh!
I know I am.

We gotta go.
[CLEARS THROAT]

Well, uh, Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.

<i>I hope to see you soon.</i>

Dice, why did you just do that?

Get your girls and go to the car now.
What?

Get the girls and go to the car.
Don't make me make a scene, Billie.

[DISGUSTED SIGH]

You-- oh!

What an incredible voice.

Oh, I-- You know, maybe we could
write something together.

He didn't mean it like that, okay?
so stop it.

Stop it? Billie, you should be pleased.

You know, the artiste--

Whoo! Wow, he wants to write
a song with you.

That's beautiful. Pretty guy.

Do you think he'd want
to actually write a song with you...

If you were, uh, properly dressed?

<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>

What it means is, look at everything.
Everything is hangin' out.

Where do you get this from anyway?
I got this from you.

Why don't you just leave her alone, okay?
Hey, mouth! Did I ask you?

You just mad 'cause you don't
produce her no more.

<i>Get over it.</i>
Louise, don't say that.

Hey, Louise, you know what?

I produce just something a little
more than a body pop, fat ass!

Dice!
Fat ass?

Who you callin' fat ass?
You got plenty of ass.

You do not talk to her like that!

I told you once.
Don't mouth off again, roach bag!

Dice! Shut up!

Okay, you know what? Let's just
get out of here.
Could you pull over?

He doesn't know what he's saying.
He's drunk. Okay? Apologize!

What's the matter with you?
<i>You're drunk!</i>

Could you pull over?
Yeah, pull over!

You guys, please--
[ROXANNE] Could we get out?

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

<i>Yeah, good night.</i>

You're pathetic.

You comin', Billie?

Fine.


Billie, I'm sorry.

What's happening to you?

None of this would've happened
if you didn't believe in me.

I don't care about this without you.

You know I love you, right?

[DICE SIGHS]

<i>[MAN]</i>
<i>You watch where you're goin'!</i>

<i>You behave tonight.</i>

Hey!

You know we're doing <i>Late Night Live</i>
tonight, right?

Have you decided what you're gonna wear
to the after-party yet?

I don't remember bein' invited to
no after-party.

Where's Dice?

I was wonderin' that myself.

How did you get in here?


Cute kid.

You ever wondered how you got
to have all this nice stuff?

What do you want?

Well, Dice and me, we had a deal.

He was supposed to give me $100,000
for the rights to your contract.

As of yet, I haven't received
a penny of my money.

I don't know anything about that.
Maybe you should talk to the label.

no deal with the label.
I made a deal with your boyfriend.

Now, I don't wanna hurt you...

But I will.

Mm-hmm.

Tell Dice I stopped by.

You sounded terrible on the phone.
What's goin' on? Are you okay?

No, I'm not okay.
Billie, what's wrong? What's wrong?

Timothy was here today.

Wha-- in our house?
Yes, in our house.

What'd he say?
He said you have a deal with him.
You owe him money.

What is going on with you?
What else did he say?

I'm not gonna tell you, 'cause you're
gonna freak out and make everything worse.

Tell me exactly what he said!
Stop screaming at me!

Okay, I'm asking you calmly.
What did he say?

He said if you don't pay him his money,
he's gonna hurt me.

He's gonna hurt you?
Yes.

That's what he said in our home?
Yes. That's what he said.

Okay. Okay.

Where are you going?

<i>â™ª Don't push me</i>
<i>'Cause I'm close to the edge â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm tryin' not to lose my head â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh </i>
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes â™ª</i>

Hey, what the--

[MALE OFFICER] Don't move!
[FEMALE OFFICER]<i> Stay right there!</i>

Okay, your dressing room's
just right over here.

If you want a coffee,
right behind that black.

If you need to speak to me,
pick up the phone and hit pound.

All right, I'll pick you up
halfway through the third act.
Just like we rehearsed it.

<i>Just like we rehearsed it.</i>
Did you get the tea for her?

Yeah, I need some honey for my throat.
We got it.

Okay, good. Yeah, okay.
You have the honey, the lemon,
the tea. You take care.

You're gonna give a great performance.

Can you call Dice for me, please?

Just one more time? Thanks.
I already called Peter.
I'm gonna see what's going on.

<i>[MAN ON TV, INDISTINCT]</i>
<i>[CLEARING THROAT]</i>

<i>[KNOCKING]</i>
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah?</i>

Billie? There's a phone call
for you on line one.
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

Okay, thank you.

Hello? Where are you? What?

[MAN] There they are!
[KELLY] Guys!

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

One second!

Billie! One more over here,
Please!

<i>Dice, talk to her!</i>
<i>We still love you!</i>

I'm standing in front of the 11th Precinct
where, moments ago,

Julian "Dice" Black
was released from custody.

He was accompanied by
singing sensation Billie Frank.

Apparently earlier tonight,
Miss Frank left <i>Late Night Live...</i>

moments before she was to perform
as this week's musical guest.

<i>It appears Ms. Frank's partner</i>
<i>was detained outside the Soho offices...</i>

of music producer Timothy Walker.

Walker was badly beaten
and had to be hospitalized.

We'll have more on this as details surface.

I'm Karen Diana--

I'm sorry about that, Billie. I--

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

It's a little late for that.
They'll get over it, yeah?

They'll get over it?

You know what? I'm over it.

Wha- What are you saying, Billie?

I'm saying that
I'm not gonna sit around...

And let you ruin everything that I'm working for.
Everything you're working for?

Yes.
Since when has it been about you?
This is about us.

Was it about us when you made
your deal with Timothy?

Was that us?
I don't recall it being us.

I was trying to protect you!
Oh, good job, Dice! Good job.

You know what? If it wasn't for me,
you'd be waitin' tables at Larry One-Note's.

Maybe I would.

But then I guess you wouldn't have anybody
to bail your ass out anymore.

You want me to get down on my
hands and knees and thank you for everything?

Because at the end of the day it is--
Get off me!

At the end of the day it is all
about you, right? Your entourage, your videos--

That's total bullshit!
No, your whole thing. The
superstar always comes first.

Don't blame me for your failure.

My failure?

Do you really think that because you swing
your ass around on stage...

And you hit a couple of
high notes here and there...

That you are some colossal success?

Your mother would have been proud.

<i>[BANGING]</i>
<i>[GLASS CRASHING]</i>

<i>Billie.</i>

Billie, I put everything on the line for you.
Yeah, including me.

I gotta say good-bye to you.
Billie, please--

I don't know how I'm gonna do that.

<i>[ROXANNE] Who is it?</i>
It's Billie.

Hi.
Long time no see.

I left Dice.

Well, come on in.

Hallelujah!
It's about time you got rid of that--

Can you tell me what's going on?
'Cause I'm really not in the mood for this today.

Oh, I think that you'll be
in the mood for this.

I'm gonna kill you.
Come on. Don't be shy.

Hey.
Hi.

See, now, I told you we'd
see each other again.

Rafael's got a great idea for a duet.
Mm.

What did you do?

So, uh, you wanna make some music?

What, are you kidding me?
Great. I'll, uh, leave you two alone.

Bye, Jack.
Come here. Come around.

I can't believe this. Was this your idea?
Have a seat.

I really didn't believe it
when you said you wanted to work together.

Are you kidding? Of course.
Aah!

I couldn't wait to get you in here.

I'm nervous. I'm sorry.
Don't be. Now listen, it's real simple.

I have a melody, but if
you hear something, fall in.

It's like--
Okay.

â™ª [VOCALIZING] â™ª

â™ª [VOCALIZING] â™ª
Mm!

Mm-hmm!
Good, good, good.

Oh, cue.
Chorus is like, uh--

â™ª [FUNK] â™ª

â™ª ["WANT YOU" PLAYING] â™ª

<i>â™ª I â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Had a crush on you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Painstakingly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Would conceal the truth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You probably always knew â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, I â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Was so into you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now I wonder why â™ª</i>

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
<i>â™ª [CONTINUES] â™ª</i>

It sounds good.
This is fresh. This is fresh.

It came out good, right?
Mm. I'm gonna tell the label...

to leak this to
radio stations this week.

Can you do that?
Yep.

Oh, man!

Thank you.
[MAN ON TV] What's the latest, Tanya?

Julian "Dice" Black,
The New York City DJ...

who discovered music sensation
Billie Frank...

Was found dead in Lower Manhattan
earlier this evening.

[ASTONISHED GROANS]

Dice, as he was known
in music circles,

was the victim of
a gunshot wound to the chest.

Police are ruling his death
a homicide,

and at present, no suspects
have been apprehended.

<i>I'm Tanya Kim for NYC News.</i>

Let's hope she wasn't with him.

[CHEERING DIES DOWN]

<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

Everybody out there,

don't ever take anybody for granted...

'cause you never know
when you might lose 'em...

and you may never get
a chance to tell 'em how you really feel.

â™ª You're with me â™ª

â™ª till the bitter end â™ª

â™ª What we have transcends â™ª

â™ª This experience â™ª

â™ª Too painful to â™ª

â™ª Talk about â™ª
[SCATTERED CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

â™ª So I'll hold it in â™ª

â™ª Till my heart can mend â™ª

â™ª And be brave enough
to love again â™ª

â™ª A place in time â™ª

â™ª Still belongs to us â™ª

â™ª Stays preserved
in my mind â™ª

â™ª In the memories
there is solace â™ª

â™ª Oh-ho â™ª

â™ª Never too far away â™ª

â™ª I won't let time erase â™ª

â™ª One bit of yesterday â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I have learned that â™ª

â™ª Nobody â™ª

â™ª Can take your place â™ª

â™ª Though we can never be â™ª

â™ª I'll keep you close to me â™ª

â™ª When I remember â™ª

â™ª A place in time â™ª

â™ª Still belongs to us â™ª

â™ª Stays preserved in my mind â™ª

â™ª In the memories there is solace â™ª

â™ª Oh-ho â™ª

â™ª Never too far away â™ª

â™ª I won't let time erase â™ª

â™ª One bit of yesterday â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I have learned that â™ª

â™ª Nobody â™ª

â™ª Can take your place â™ª

â™ª And though we can never be â™ª

â™ª You're never too far â™ª

Love, Dice."

<i>â™ª She was kind of fragile â™ª</i>
