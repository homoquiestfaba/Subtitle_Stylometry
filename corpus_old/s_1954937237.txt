[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[dog whining in fear]


[shop bell jingles]

[dog growls]

Hey.


What is it, Charley?


Hey.

Charley.
Who's a good boy?

Huh?

[shop bell jingles]
Cora,

You've got
enough food here

for a month.

The storm's only
supposed to last

a couple of days.

My nieces are coming
to stay with me.

They get in this afternoon.

Hope it's enough.

All things considered,

do you think
that's such a good idea?

The girls, they...

[Charley barks]

They-they don't have
any options right now, so...


I'm just saying, you know,
I mean, we got a storm coming

and it's Halloween
tomorrow, so...

maybe they should just wait.

Not everyone's
as superstitious as you Donald.


All right, go on.

See you soon.

You bet.



Hey, Charley.

Hey, come on.

Come on, baby.



Oh, grumpy.

Fine, we'll get you home.


[shop bell jingles]

[radio static]

[static crackling]

[turns off radio]

Useless.

[thunder clapping]

Hey!

It's okay, Charley.

It's okay, Charley,
it's just a bit of lightning.

Hey, come on.
Charley?

[barking and snarling]

Charley? Stop it!

[barking furiously]

Charley, stop it now!

Charley, no!

No!

Charley!


[thunder rolling]

Charley!

[dog whines distantly]

Charley?

Charley...

[dog whines fearfully]

[branches rustle and crack]

You okay in there, boy?

[dog whines]

Come on, baby.

It's okay.

[loud thunderclap]


[screaming,
deep guttural roar]

[forest falls silent]

[screaming echoes]

[screaming in terror]

[screaming and crying]

[gasping in fright]

Is everyone okay?

Fine.

I thought you said
you were good to drive.

You're not seriously
going to blame this on me?

Be my guest.

Sounded like
a bad one.

You want to talk about it?

No.

We'll get
through this, okay?

I thought we had
an agreement.

And what agreement
is that exactly?

I have a hard time keeping track
of all your rules.

No more arguing
in front of Emma,

she's been though enough, okay?

She doesn't need to see us

at each other's throats
all the time.

Well, excuse me
if I'm not all that excited

about leaving behind
what little of my life is left.

You're not the only one

who's had to put
their life on hold here, Marley.

And I thought
we agreed...

no more of this
in front of Emma.

We could have found a way.

If you really cared,

we could have
found a way to stay.

The money's gone, Marley.

Mom and Dad's life insurance

didn't come close to covering
Emma's hospital bills.

If we want to
be together,

Aunt Cora's
the only option.

There's nowhere else to go.

We need to get going,

or we're going to
miss the ferry.

The ferry's
not much further.

There's supposed to
be a ferry.

The schedule said 3:00.

I guess we'll just
have to go back.

[gasping in fright]

Sorry, I...

I didn't mean to
sneak up on you like that.

The schedule said
that there was a 3:00?

Well, uh, lot's of folks
been comin' off the island,

so I didn't expect anybody'd be
wantin' to go.

We don't.

We do.

Well, um, there's a big storm
expected tonight,

and if we was to take you over
to the island now, by ferry,

there might not be another ferry
until the storm breaks.

and that could be
a couple of days.

The island's not somewhere
you want to be stuck,

not during a storm,

especially not
this time of year.

You heard the man,

this is an all around

bad idea.

The ferry is scheduled
to be running,

and we'd like to
be on it.

Have it your way.

Oh.

Looks like you'll have
some company after all.

Emma?

Emma?

You folks are gonna
be wanting

to get up to the ramp now,

if you want to go.

Just pay when you're on.

There was a young girl
in our back seat.

Did you see where she went?

I thought it was just
the two of you.

Emma?

Emma!

I can't hold
the ferry,

not with
the storm comin'.

Emma, we need to go!

Emma?

Emma!

Emma!

Emma!
Emma!

Emma!
Emma, come on, let's go!

Emma, we have
to go now.

Emma!

Emma, where are you?

Emma, where are you?

Emma!

Emma, we have to
get on the ferry,

or we're going to be
stuck here tonight!

Emma?

We don't want to be stuck here.

Emma!

[leaves rustling]

Emma?

Emma?


It's all right.
It's okay.

It's all right.
It's okay.

I just, uh...

I wanted to let you know

I saw that girl
you were looking for.

She was walking
towards the ferry.

I just thought
you'd want to know.

Hey, I'd, uh,
stay off that island

till the storm passes

if I were you.

I think we'll manage.

Oh, I don't know
about that.

Last time a storm hit
that island on Halloween, uh,

half the people there
ended up dead.

I'd just steer clear,
that's all I'm saying.

If you're so worried,
then why are you going?

I have my reasons.

I guess that makes two of us.

I didn't warn you.

[bird shrieks]

[crying softly]

Sarah, I found her!

I found Emma!

Em, what are you doing?

You scared the hell out of us.

What is it, Em?

Are you all right?

It's Aunt Cora,

something's happened to her.

Aunt Cora's fine,

we just talked to her
this morning.

But I saw it,

in my dream.

Emma, what's going on?

I'm sorry, I just...

I wanted to see
the island.

[thunder rolling]

It's okay,

no harm done.

We gotta get going, though.

Her dreams aren't
getting any better.

She needs time.

Things will get better.

She watched our parents
burn to death in their own car,

she barely survived it herself.

You really think she's ever
going to get over that?

[thunder rolling]

[ferry horn honks]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[call ringing]

Where the hell is everyone?

Aunt Cora's
still not answering.

Em's been sleeping
an awful lot.

It's her meds.

It makes her tired.

Well that's really going to
help with the nightmares.

You do know where
you're going, right?

Don't start, okay?

Someone's watching us.

Pick a direction
and let's just go.

[cell phone signal searching]

What does the GPS say?

Nothing, there's
no reception out here.

I thought you said you knew
where you were going?

I got turned around, okay?

I thought I saw
that green car again.

Guys...

Nothing is ever
your fault, is it?

Guys!

We're almost out of gas.

How long has it
been like that?

[distant squealing roar]

What is that?

I don't know, Em.

Drive, just drive.

[engine sputtering]

[engine sputtering and dying]

No...

No. [groans]

This isn't happening.

Tell me this
isn't happening.

We just have to walk, okay?

Aunt Cora's is
just down the road.

[hissing roar]

Leave it.
Let's just go.

We need Emma's medication.

Let's just go,
come on.

Sarah.

Okay.

Let's go.

Who's wishing
we stayed in the city now?

We need to go faster.


Ow! Ow!
Emma!

Ow!

[sobbing and wincing]

Are you okay?
We're almost there.

There.
Is that Aunt Cora's house?

[gasping in pain and effort]

Oh, my God.

Get Emma in the house.

What?

Marley, get Emma
in the house.

What are you
going to do?

No. No, Sarah...

Sarah!

Sarah!

Sarah, don't go!

Sarah, I saw this
in my dream!

[Emma screaming]

[branches rustling]

Aunt Cora...

Oh, my God...



It's here...

It's here!

[shrieking and roaring]

[dial tone drones]

[hits speed-dial]

[call ringing]

[call cuts out]


Emma, stay in the basement!

It isn't safe up here.

Where's Sarah?

I don't know, Em!

I don't know.

Sarah?

Sarah?


Give me a hand.

Don't just
stand there, Marley,

help me get her
in the house.

Where's Emma?

She's already
in the basement.

What the hell
is going on, Sarah?

What happened to her?

Listen to me--

What happened
to Aunt Cora?

Listen to me,

there's
someone out there

that killed Aunt Cora,

and they're after
this woman.

Do you understand
what that means?

[distant shrieking]

We need to get
in the basement!

Marley, come on!

[distant shrieking]

How's she doing?

Not good.

My three months
in medical school

isn't going to cut it.

She needs a doctor.

[thunderclap rumbles]


You...

you must hide.

Death has come.

The killing won't stop

until the end of Halloween.

Everything's
going to be okay.

No, it's not.

I didn't believe...

you have to.

What did she just say?

What the hell
is she talking about?

I don't know.

She's in a lot of pain.

It's time you tell me
what happened to Aunt Cora.

I'm not sure, okay?

Stop treating me like a child!

Tell me what happened!

I don't know what happened
to her, all right!

I deserve to know, Sarah.

Fine, you wanna know?

Her eyes were gone,

just gone,

like someone cut them
out of her head or something.

And then some sick twist
set her insides on fire.

What?

What?

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have told you,
not like that.


This afternoon, in the truck,

Emma said she had a dream
about Aunt Cora,

that something happened to her.

How did she know that, Sarah?

How?

It's...

It's coincidence.

I mean, it has to be.

She's been having
those types of dreams

about all of us.

She thinks death follows
her around wherever she goes.

She's terrified

that everyone around her
is gonna die.

Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

<i>Emma!</i>

<i>[screams echo]</i>

[inhales deeply]

Emma's still out.

Let her sleep.

She had a rough night,

and I don't want her
to see Aunt Cora.

That woman
doesn't look too good.

If we don't get her
to a hospital,

she's not going to last
much longer.

I found a hose.

Okay, so we'll siphon the gas
from Aunt Cora's car--

that can't be
too hard--

we'll get ours going,
and...

we'll get her
to the hospital.

She said the killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

What if whoever chased her here
and killed Aunt Cora

is just out there

waiting for us?

If we stay here,
she'll die for sure.

Give me the hose.

[flies buzzing]

Just don't look, okay?

Let's just get this
over with.

I should have
listened to him.

Listened to who?

That creepy guy
back at the ferry?

He said the last time a storm
hit here on Halloween,

nearly everyone died.

He said what?

And you're just
telling me this now?

I thought he was just
some weirdo, okay?

For all you know,
he's the one doing all of this!

I didn't
want to worry you

any more than you
already were,

I am so sick and tired
of you thinking

you know what's best for me!

That's enough,
Marley--

It's not enough
that our parents are dead?

Now you're going to get
the rest of us killed--

I said that's enough!


Marley...

Don't touch me.

Don't, okay, just don't.

Why would someone do that
to another person?

It's gone.

What's gone?

The car is gone.

Okay...

Okay, so... so we'll walk.

We need to get that woman
to the hospital.

We'll send someone, all right?

We just need to get
the hell out of here

while we still can!

What about Emma?

She won't make far
with her leg like that.

Well, what do you
suggest we do,

just wait here
until that psycho shows up?

No...

no way in hell.

We don't have a choice, Marley.

You know we don't.

You keep watch...

I'll deal with it.

[flies buzzing]

Marley, I'm...

I'm going to need
your help after all.

[engine starter chugging]


Em, stay where you are!

Is everything all right?

I woke up,
and you guys weren't there.

Em, you shouldn't be out here.
You need to go back inside.

But everyone was gone.

I didn't know where you were--

Emma!

Emma, get away from there!


Emma!

Emma, kick!

Kick!

Get it!

Emma, kick!

[groaning with effort]

Emma! Marley!



This isn't happening.

Tell me this
isn't happening!

[screams and sobs]

Em, not much
longer, okay?

Everything's going
to be all right.

We're getting
out of here.

And where the hell
are we going to go, huh?

Or have you forgotten

that there's no way
off this island

until tomorrow?

We'll--we'll
find help in town.

Are you serious?

Did you see that thing?

Who the hell's going to
be able to help us?

I don't know, all right?

But you're not
helping the situation.

Do you understand?

Sarah's right, Em.

We're going to get through this,

and then we'll find
a way out of here.

I should...

I should have
told you.

Told me what?

I saw it.

We all did.

Just try not to
think about it.

No, no.

I saw it
in my dream.

I should have
warned you.

That woman's dead
because of me.

None of this
is your fault, Em.

Whatever's happening here
has nothing to do with you.


What was that?

Everyone
stay in the car.

Hitting him
didn't do that.

We need to get
the hell out of here now

before we end up like him.

We need to find help.

These people aren't
going to help us.

You saw how they just
stared at us before.

They were scared,

they knew
this was going to happen.

There's nowhere else to go,

you said so yourself.

We can go to the ferry dock.

Maybe there's
another boat there,

they should at least
have a radio, right?

Please, Sarah, just this once,

I need you to listen to me.

We need to go now.

Okay,

let's get in the car.

Emma?

Emma?

Emma!

She just
wandered off, right?

Like she did before?

Emma!

If something happened,
we would have heard.

Oh, my God.

She thinks
everyone around her dies.

She's trying to protect us.

No.

No, no, no... No!

Emma!

Emma!

Emma?

Emma!

Emma?

Emma!

Emma!

Emma?

Emma!

Emma!

Emma?


Emma?


Emma?

Emma?

Emma, none of this
is your fault.

Not another sound.

Emma?

They're dead.

They're all dead.

[door creaking]

Emma?

Emma, is that you?

You need to come out, okay?

None of this is your fault.

Em, you in here?

[screaming]
You need to get out of here.

Get out!



Sarah!

Sarah!




No!


[shots blasting]

Come on, let's go, let's go!



[muffled protests]

[muffled groans]

[shop bell jingles]

I need to find my sisters.

let you do that.

What you need to do
is shut the hell up, okay?

That thing out there
was almost gone

until you and
your friends showed up.

You almost got us
all killed.

Let her go, Toby.

I think she gets
the message.

Yeah?
She better have.

Now, maybe you'll be able
to keep her quiet, too.

[muffled cries]

Sarah?

What did they do to you?

She didn't
leave us any choice.

She wouldn't stop yelling.
It was going to hear us in here.

Where's Emma?
Did you find her?

Please, our sister
is out still there.

I'm sorry,

but if your sister's
out there right now,

she's already dead.

But you're all alive,

you've managed to survive.

We survived by accident.

When everyone else
ran away,

we all hid in the freezer.

We could hear them,

but we knew
if we opened the door,

we'd be dead
right along with them.

What the hell
is that thing out there?

Why don't you ask
Mr. Internet Sensation

over here.

He seems to have
all the answers.

You knew about this
at the ferry,

and you didn't
say anything?

Look, I tried to warn you,
all right, I did.

When I saw you on Main Street,

I was gonna tell
you guys everything,

but you drove off
too fast.

You said that
some people died

in the last storm that was here.

You never said anything

about that thing
out there!

Look, I was just trying
to mess with you, all right?

I didn't think it was real.

Yeah?

Thought it was real enough
to bring a gun.

Okay, look, I have
a web series, all right?

I stay overnight
at haunted places.

None of them ever really
turn out to be haunted,

right?

I bring the gun

because you never know
who you're going to run into

on these things.

It's just me.

There's a lot of
crazies out there.

I just bring it

for protection.

It's...

A couple of weeks ago, I...

I was in a bar,

I met this old guy,

he was drunk,

started in
with this story

about an island
that he used to live on.

Said that on Halloween, 1915,
a storm hit,

killed half the people here.

Get to the part

where you tell us what's killing
everyone out there.

Officially?

The locals say
it was the storm.

The old man says that the storm
brought something with it,

something evil.

Yeah.

Tell her why.

On the eve of Halloween,
before the storm hit,

the townspeople,

they burned six girls
at the stake for...

for practicing witchcraft.

Now, as the story goes,

before the girls
burned to death,

they summoned a storm...

lightning struck
each one of them,

pulling their spirits
up into the storm,

so that they could return
as something far,

far more evil.

They unleashed their revenge
on the island

until the sun came up,

ending All Hallows' Eve.

And that's not even
the best part.

The witches, they, um,

they vowed to return

on the anniversary
of their murder,

once every hundred years,

wipe out everyone
who dares stay on the island.

People around here

have been telling
that story for years,

but nobody ever
believed them.

Yeah, well, I'm sure
as hell a believer.

So how do we kill it?

We don't...

we survive it.

The killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

Tonight's Halloween,

and that's why
we're not leaving until morning,

not until sunrise.

We'll stay here for the night,

and that thing will
go back where it came from,

just like it did last time.

Well, that's not happening.

I told you,
our sister's out there,

and we're going to find her.

Wait, you can't--

What makes you think

you're the only one
who's lost someone?

If you wanna stop us,
you're gonna have to shoot us.

I'm not playing around here!

Hey, just let
her go, Toby!

No one is leaving here
until morning, okay?

Until that sun rises,

no one is leaving
this building.

I don't think
it kills everyone.

I don't think
it kills everyone.

Not right away at least.

You know, I think it's
taking them somewhere.

Why do you
think that?

When we were out
chasing after these two,

I saw quite a few
bloody drag marks

where there was no bodies.

And?

And they were all heading
in the same direction.

I've been thinking about it,

and the only thing
that would make sense

is if it's dragging them all
to the same place.

But why?

And who says
they're not already dead?

I'm just saying that
there's still a chance.

Why take some of the bodies,
but not the others?

You know, maybe there are
survivors out there.

Jill's dead, all right?

Then where's her body, huh?

Don't--

Why wasn't it here
with the others?

Who's Jill?

Ask him.

You know as well as I do

that if I would have
opened up that freezer door,

we would all be dead.

Okay?
I saved your life.

We never should
have been here

in the first place.

Come with us.

You're looking
for someone, too.

We can search
together.

You must be good with
tracking and stuff, right?

This was our first trip out.

We came to the island

because you're not allowed
to hunt here.

The deer don't know
to be afraid, you know?

They're easy picking.

I was just trying
to impress my girlfriend.

Well, none of that changes
the fact that no one's leaving.

Says who?

Oh, you don't got the guts!

Yeah? Try me!

Okay, okay...

Okay, this is
getting out of hand.

Toby, if they want to leave,
just let them leave.

Maybe they'll
lead it away, right?

Come on.

[woman screaming]

[screaming in terror]
Somebody help me, please!

Anybody!

Do you see anything?

Not yet.

Nothing over here.

God, you need
to help me!

You're
kidding me, right?

If I'm dying,
I'm leaving a record.

I'm going to find her

and shut her up
before she gets us all killed.

No, wait.

Wait.

I see her in the parking lot.

[woman screaming]
Somebody!

Please!

I don't want to die!

Why is she just standing there,
out in the open like that?

We got to go get her.

No, not so fast.

Something's not right.

We can't just let her
die out there!

There.

There it is.

Do you see it?


Help me!

Oh, my God.

It's using her
as bait.

So, what do we do?

Nothing.

We can't just
do nothing--



What the hell
were you thinking?

It slipped, okay?
I'm sorry.

We have to
get out of here.

Maybe we're good,

maybe it didn't
hear us.

We'll hide it out
in the freezer

just like last time.

We can't get
trapped in here,

we have to find Emma.

Look, you can
stand out here

and discuss this
all you want,

but as soon as
that freezer door closes...

there's no getting in.

It's keeping
people alive, Toby.

You just
saw it yourself.

Jill might
still be alive.

Help me find her.
You owe her that.

We're no use to anybody
if we're dead.

Now, who's coming with me?

Nichole, what the hell
are you doing? Come on.

I don't want
anybody else to die

because I did nothing.

Come on, Alex,
don't be stupid.

You're a coward, Toby.

I just don't see the upside
in being a dead hero.

Nice knowing you.

Good luck.

Do you hear that?


It's gone.

It stopped,

that doesn't mean
that it's gone.

I only have
three rounds left.

That's not going to
get us far.

The sheriff's station
is a block down.

We might stay
out of sight

if we go through
the alley in the back.

What if it's
waiting for us there?

We need those weapons.

You head there.

I'll draw it away.

I'm going to
need this.

Marley, what the hell
are you doing?

Marley!

Go to the left.

Maybe we should
have gone with them.

I didn't stop you.

What if there are other people
still alive out there, Toby?

We could help them--

We already
risked our necks

once for them,

look at the thanks
that got us.

The only person

I'm interested in
keeping alive now

is myself.

Well, I'm going after them,
and they're--

[groaning in pain]

[muffled gunshots]

[screaming and thudding]

I guess
we wait and see

what your sister
has in store.

What the hell did she do?

Okay, if we're going to go,
we're going to go now.

Go. I got your back.

Go.

It's just around
the other side of the building.

Check that room
over there.

[static crackling]

Hello. Can anyone hear me?

[static crackling]

Hello?

Does anybody copy?

Can you hear me?

Hello. Is anyone
out there?

Please.
Can anyone hear me?

This is
an emergency.

Hello.
Does anybody copy?

Can you hear me?

This is
an emergency.

Is anyone out there?

Hello? Does
anybody hear me?

This is an emergency.


I'm okay...

I'm okay.

Do you think it heard us?

I don't know.

Come on, let's go.

This is everything.

Do you really think

all this is going
to stop that thing?

Well, it slowed it down
the first time.

That's... something,
right?

She'll be back.

We'd best
be going, Sarah.

We don't want to be
looking in the dark.

So, are you going to show us how
to load these things?

Everything is loaded
and good to go.

You just got to
release the safety.

It's, uh,
it's right there,

by, uh, by your thumb.

You wanna just...

press it.

You said that
all the drag marks

were headed
in the same direction.

Which way was that?

Well,

these are the ones

that I saw this morning.

And this...

this is the one we saw
on the way here.

They all seem
to be leading

to this side of the island.

What's over here?

Nothing really,
it's just forest.

There is
an old power station

not far from there.

It's been closed
for years.

Right...

here.


What the hell?



God! Please help!

[wood splintering]

Shoot it!


I'll get the door.

Alex?

Alex...


[screaming in agony]



[gun clicking uselessly]

[tires screeching]

Get in!

Where's Alex
and Nichole?

Go! Go, go!

Head out of town.

I think I know where it is.

Are you going to
tell me what happened?

It killed them,
all right?

Like it does everyone else.

Where were you
all that time?

I thought I heard Emma,
so I went looking.

And?

I found this...

But there were drag marks,
like Alex was saying.

She's still
alive, okay?

I think it's a left up here.

To go where?

Alex and Nichole thought
they found the spot

it might be taking them.

Okay.

You sure about this?

There's an
old power plant.

It looks like

the drag marks
are leading there.

Better than
nothing, right?

Yeah.

It should be
through here.

We should
keep going.

[branches rustling]

There.

Sarah...

There's a trail
over this way.

This must be
where it's dragging them.

Come on.

[branches rustling]

[branches rustling]

Sarah?

Sarah?

Sarah?

Sarah, is that you?

Sarah?

Sarah!

Marley!


[distant shrieking]

This must be
where they burned them,

the girls,

like Seth was saying.

The trail,
it just ends here.

There's fresh blood here...


Marley!

Oh, my God.

They're
in here, Marley.

There in here!


[groaning with effort]

[coughing and sobbing]

Please, please,
please, please...

it's gonna be back.

It feeds on us.

Emma!

Emma, say something!

[gasping with effort]

No, no...

Emma, say something!

No... No, no!

Emma!

Sh-She...

She needs to be quiet.

It will hear her.

Emma!

Marley, help me!

She has to be here somewhere!

Over here!

Over here, I have her!

Emma!

Shh! Shh!

Emma!

Be quiet...

[roaring with effort]

Be quiet.

Please, please,
please be quiet...

Emma...

[grunting with effort]

Shh! Shh...

[gasping and panting]

Emma,

we're gonna get you
out of here.

No! No! Help me!

Help me!

Help me!

Help me!
Help me!

Help!

Get up.
Get up...


Get her out of here.

Keep her safe.

Sarah?

Sarah, no! No!

You're not going to get her,
you son-of-a-bitch!

Sarah!

Sarah!

Emma, go on.

Emma, can you help me?
Come on.

Emma, we've got to
get out of here.

Come on Emma,
just a little further.

Emma? Emma, you're going to
have to help, okay?

Look. Look, that must be
part of the power plant.

Come on.
Almost there.

Hang in there, Emma.

Emma, stay with me.

[gasping with exhaustion]

[thunder rumbling]

[chain rattling]
No. No...

<i>I saw this in my dream.</i>

Come on.

Emma, don't!

Emma!

[distant growling]


[gasping in relief]

It's okay...
It's okay.

We need to get out of here.

I thought...

I thought you were...

Yeah, me too.

Emma...

Emma?


It's okay,
it's okay, it's me.

[thunder crackling]

[distant shrieking]

We don't have
time for that.

I've almost got it.

I've almost...

I've got it!

[shrieking approaching]

Come on.

I'm scared.

I know.

We all are.

We just need to wait it out
in here until morning,

and this will all be over.

We should find somewhere
to stay out of sight.

We stick together, right?

No more running off.


Get it off me!

Get it off!

Get it off me!

Emma, Emma, go.

No! I'm not leaving you!

Pull!

Emma, I said, go!


Go, go, go!

There must be somewhere to hide,
somewhere it can't find us.

There's no way out.
It won't be able to get to us.

There's no time!


Keep going!

Keep going.


There.
We can hide in there.

We're going to
get out of here, okay?

No. No, we aren't.

I saw it, in my dream.

Everyone around me dies.

We're not dying, Emma.

I'm not leaving you,
you hear me?

[low growling]


[gasping in terror]

[shrieking overhead]

I love you guys.

What?

What?

Hey, you son-of-a-bitch!

Sarah--

Shh!

[muffled sobbing]

I'm over here!

Sarah!

[sobbing and screaming]

Hey!

Hey!

Come and get me!

[muffled screams]

Shh! Emma, shh.

Come on!

I'm down here!


Hey!

I'm over here!

Come and get me,
you son of a bitch!


[muffled screams]

I'm in here!

Come and get me!

I'm in here!

[low growling]

[muffled screams and sobs]



Sarah!

Emma!

Emma, don't!

Emma!

[muffled screaming and banging]

Sarah!

[banging and screaming]


Sarah. Sarah!


Sarah!

No!

Sarah!

Emma. Emma, go.

Emma, run,

and don't look back.

Go hide.

Hide, and don't come out
until the sun comes up.

[low growling]

Marley?

Emma, go!


Hey!

Asshole!

Come on.

Come on!


Emma?

Emma...

Marley,
it's after me!

It's after me!

Hey!

Hey!

Take me, you son-of-a-bitch!




If I'm going to die,

then I'm taking you with me!


Marley!


Marley, please,
please, don't leave me.

Marley, please,
don't leave me all alone!

You're alive.

I told you to stay hidden
until the sun was up.

I did.

It's almost morning.

You need to go for help.

No. No, I'm not leaving you.

I need you to bring help.

But...

If I don't get help,

I'm probably going to...

No, don't...
Don't say that, okay?

I'll... I'll go.

We're going to be okay, Em.

Promise me.

I promise.


[branches rustling]

I'm sorry, Em.

[gasps in fear]

Hey!

The sun is up!

Time to die, you bastard!

Emma, what are you doing? Run!



What are you doing?

We're going home.

[groaning in pain]
