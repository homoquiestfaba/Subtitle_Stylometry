Here is a special

and urgent message for you.

This is WKRG bringing you important news

from civil defense.

A state of emergency has been
issued across Essex County

by the National Weather Service,

with governor Wayne urging
citizens to stay in their homes,

lock the doors, relieve
use of electric appliances,

and most importantly

do not get caught in the winds.

Those individuals tainted by the storm

are reported to behave
erratic and violently.

Be wary of those around you.

They may be a danger to your wellbeing.

Latest disclosure indicates that the wind

started around 5:15 PM.

Protected law enforcement officers

are being mobilized to control the streets

of distressed homeless
and sick individuals

as reports of looting
and unlawful break ins

have grown significantly
over the last several hours.

Cooperate with civil defense workers

and they will help you.

We will remain on the
air to update listeners

as we monitor the phenomena.

Until then, this has been 97.8 WKRG

bringing you the news and
tunes of the countryside.

â™ª I waited by the chapel door â™ª

â™ª But you weren't â™ª

â™ª In the silence of the night â™ª

Who the fuck are you?
Don't shoot.

Don't shoot.
Who are you?

My name is Jacob.

My name is Jacob Thompson.

How did you get into my house?

Your cellar hatch was unlocked.

God damn it.

Look, I had no other choice.

The dust clouds came in and...

You didn't caught in those winds, did you?
No, no, no.

That's what I'm trying to tell you.

I made it in here before it got to me.

Where you live around here?

You're not one of them
rabid, fucking homeless?

No, no, no.

36 Elmund Road, off the river.

I barkeep The Weary
Traveler on weeknights.

You ever been?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm been.

Look, I am...

I didn't break anything.

I promise that.

You broke into my house.

Well...

All right.

Come upstairs, get yourself cleaned up.

You can stay until this blows through.

I don't need your safety on my conscience.

Name's Arnold, Arnold Cunningham.

Thank you, Mr. Cunningham.

Some locals
believe the cause to be

that of a foreign attack.

But these claims...

Say, where were
you headed when it came?

I was just trying to make my way home.

Wasn't safe to stay in the truck so,

I had to test my look on foot.

Test my luck, I sure did.

Unlike
anything seen in this century.

The sun has disappeared
and the befouled winds

have come.

Pastor Miller of Saint Sebastian parish

says judgment is upon us.

We have met the end of the day.

That's enough of that.

The world falls apart.

These people run to scare you to death.

Teach you how to live.

So sir,

you live here alone?

Didn't used to.

Have you any...

Have you any idea what it is out there?

You read the Bible?

Not since a church school as a boy, no.

"I sent a plague among
you in the manner of Egypt.

I slew your young men by the sword

along with their captured horses.

I made the stench of your
camp rise up in your nostrils.

Yet you have not returned
to me" Amos, 4:10.

So whatever's going on out there,

maybe we deserve it.

You think this is God's work?

Not the God I thought I knew.

Hey kid.

You barkeep with The Weary Traveler, huh?

Part time.

Uncontrolled hysteria.

Hey kid?

I hope it was all right
that I used your restroom

While you were out.

You sure can handle your
whiskey, Mr. Cunningham.

Everything all right?

Let's have a seat.

Yeah.

Something happened while I was gone?

I got a postulation

burrowing in my head.

When and where did you leave your truck

before you got to my house?

Uh, uh, I don't really know.

It got kind of hard to see

once the dust clouds rolled in.

Like, six.

You didn't get caught
in those winds, huh?

No.

Takes me about five, 10 minutes

to get to The Weary Traveler by foot.

Radio tells me the wind
started blowing by 5:15.

You tell me you entered my
home before the winds hit,

but you would have come upon my home

much earlier than 7:30,

if you were coming by way
of The Weary Traveler.

And I sure know that somebody
trying to catch shelter

from the eyes of a cataclysmic storm

wouldn't take nearly two hours to do so.

Especially if the nearest residence

was only five, 10 minutes away

from where you're coming by foot

So I'm gonna ask you to again.

You lying lightweight son of a bitch,

did you get caught in the winds?

I don't know what you're trying to say.

Show me you're arm!

You take me for an idiot?

Roll up your bandage!

I outta throw you out
in those winds myself.

You best stop pointing
that shotgun at me!

What's the matter?

Feeling a little ill?

Okay, okay.

I didn't know.

Get out of my house.

I let you in,

now I'm telling you to get out.

Wait a minute.

You can't just,

you can't just throw me out there.

Now!

â™ª He's the man with the big old cape â™ª

â™ª Where the sign says general eight â™ª

The Howling Wind storm

continues to ravish the
greater northwest region

leaving panic and chaos in its path.

The National Weather
Service would like to remind

citizens of Essex County,
stay in your homes.

Lock the doors.

Relieve use of electric appliances,

and most importantly, don't
get caught in the wind.
