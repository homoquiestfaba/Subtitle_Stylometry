Then I took it out to eat it.

It wasâ€¦

this big.

Yellow, tasty looking sponge cake.

I held it in my bosom all day.

Then I saw a girl carrying
her sister on her back.

Looked obvious
they were starving.

So pale, weak and helpless

I turned away to eat it.

But I ended up giving it to them.

It must've been warm since

I carried it around all day.

I didn't know if I'll ever
have cake like that again.

She gobbled it down and shoved
some in her sisters mouth.

Think God will remember that?

Though its been 30 years?

Absoposilutely.

Remembering is His specialty.

Of course.

That song, Father Can you
play it for me, again?

You can do CPR, right?

Go!

Stop!

Again!

200 Joules.

Charge.

Those who seek direct communication
with God are prone to self-hatredâ€¦

The Devil will eat right into you.

As St Bruno said, â€œSuicide
is to die a martyr for Satan.â€

It's worse than first degree murder.

It's worth a life sentenceâ€¦
in hell.

20 Hail Mary's, get
lots of sun

and take a cold shower.

Get Gods help through science
and take some anti-depressants

Stop thinking about
killing yourself.

Andâ€¦Â forget the
bastard who dumped you.

Fatherâ€¦

I'll deal with the bastards
and the worldly matters.

You just stick to praying, Father.

Ask the bishop to send
me to Emmanuel Labs, please?

The Vatican does not
approve of that experiment.

Sarah died on Monday
even after 8 surgeries.

Hyo-sung went into
a coma yesterday.

It kills me to watch them dying.

No one knows what
really goes on at that lab.

I want to save people.

I told you to go to med school
since you were in the crib,

study ophthalmology,
and heal my eyes.

But Father, I must go andâ€¦

Enough! I'll just give you absolution.

Stick to the confession!
Geeze!

<i>Dear patients, I regret not
seeing you before I left.</i>

<i>I was busy preparing
for my sudden vacation.</i>

<i>I packed a bunch of things.</i>

<i>But they say to bring my body only.</i>

<i>The monastery prepared a
luxurious hotel for me.</i>

<i>Fr.Â Emmanuel Memorial Biochemical Labs
At times like this I'm glad I joined The Order.</i>

EV, namely Emmanuel Virus.

When infected with it,
the symptoms areâ€¦

First, blisters start
to form at the limbs,

then around the lips
eyelids, inside the nose,

then spreads to the
middle of the body

through the respiratory
and digestive tracts

The blisters cluster together
get bigger, and burst open.

If the lesions form in the muscles,

it can form big ulcers
and will hemorrhage.

If it reaches the
internal organs,

the patient will start
coughing up a lot of blood,

and eventually die
of excessive bleeding.

There is no cure.

So if you were to get
infected during the experimentâ€¦

all is lost.

Now.

Instead of the usual answer.

What is your real purpose for
volunteering for this experiment?

On occasion, some people come
here thinking prayer is useless.

and with the intent to
commit aâ€‰â€œdramatic suicideâ€.

That is very discouraging for us.

By natureâ€¦

it's hard to distinguish
the state of mind of

those who want
martyrdom or suicide.

I expect you're not
someone like that are you?

Are you sure about this?

My prayers work fine.

Please look at
the camera and speak.

Since Father Emmanuel
isolated the virus,

there's not been one African
among the 600 victims.

They've all been
Caucasians or Asians.

And over 80% of them
have been missionaries,

namely single males.

That's why the people here call
the disease theâ€‰â€œCurse of Baziraâ€.

Bazira is the goddess
of widows.

First, we administer the
vaccine we have developed,

then an inactive
EV inside the body.

Then we observe if the
vaccine functions properly.

<i>Grant me the following in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>

<i>Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.</i>

<i>Like a cripple without limbs,

<i>Remove my cheeks,

<i>Crush my lips and tongue,
that I may not sin with them.</i>

<i>Pull out my nails
that I may grasp nothing.</i>

<i>Let my shoulders and back be bent
that I may carry nothing.</i>

<i>Like a man with tumor in the head

Touch my leg, Father!

Please pray for me, Father!

Please, Father?

My daughter has leukemia!

I heardâ€¦

people are coming to seek prayers
from The Bandaged Saint?

Don't know how that
nonsense started.

Though I did hear
of some people getting cured.

Guess it can have
a psychological effect.

After all, you're the only one
who survived out of 50 volunteers.

Right?

Wow! You're so lucky!

Are you the miracle
survivor out of 500?

My son has cancer!

Please pray for him!

It's just a psychological effect
Theres nothing I can do.

Channel 9 won't come on, Mom.

Let's pray kids.

Did you ever live in Busan?

We are gathered here
to pray for Kang-woo.

Born under Your grace and love,

embracing even
a wounded street dogâ€¦

he was a kind hearted boy.

Remember his goodness
and have mercy on him.

In Jesus' name we pray.

â€“Amen.
â€“Amen.

I don't believe in this
but since it's from an old friendâ€¦

Now, I recognize you, son.

Sorry. You're a Father, now.

I'm sorry, Father.

You used to come over
for noodles.

Fifth grade, right?
You lived at the church orphanage?

My son could never pass stray

cats and was so good
to the orphans.

Your sister was so shy and
ran out whenever I came over.

She had calluses on her feet
and Kang-woo made me touch them.

Her parents rented
a small room in our house.

Her father was
a high school drop out.

This is my blood shed for
you so that sins may be forgiven.

One day, they left her in my room
and said they'd be back soon.

But they never came back!

So I took the three-year-old

in and raised her
like a daughter and puppy.

<i>Happy Hanbok</i>
Shed call meâ€‰â€œmommyâ€

I'm her mommy-in-law, now.

Marriage was no big deal.

She just moved from sleeping
in my bed to Kang-woo's.

Why'd you buy the laver
at that place again, Mom?

I told you it's no good and
the owner's a cocksucker

You hate Kimbap?

No, I'm sensitive to smell
these days.

I suddenly got a whiff of blood.

Kang-woos home.

â€“Mom, I caught a cold!
â€“What?

Hi, Sang-hyun!

I told you
to wear your long johns.

â€“Were here, too
â€“Welcome.

My friend the priest.

This is our dam's
manager and his wife.

It's an honor, Father
I'm Young-du

She's a Filipina
so she's Catholic.

Say hello, Evelyn.

â€“Tae-ju!
â€“How've you been?

Here comes the Police Chief!

Please, I quit
the force a long time ago.

He's the dam's security
head This is Fr.Â Hyun, Sang-hyun

Hello.

Do you like fishing Father?

Get on his good side and you
can fish there though its banned.

Daytimes a bit tricky.
Come by at nights.

â€“Have a seat, Father
â€“Let's get started.

Koreans don't
appreciate Mahjong.

Would you like to play, Father?

â€“Sorry. I don't know how
â€“I see.

Did I tell you about Father Hyun
praying for Kang-woo?

I was standing right
next to my son.

Suddenly, I felt something hot
come down on my head.

I felt tingly all over like
someone was poking me with needles.

Then my boy said
â€œIt feels hot right here, Mom.â€

Then the cancer vanished.

It vanished?

You always feel tingly
cuz of your blood pressure.

But I did a biopsy just in case.

The endoscope showed
it was esophagus cancer.

Women shouldn't
get sedated endoscopes.

Doctors secretly rape them.

I win!

Three closed triplets!

That's 8 points.

Can we turn the heater down?

But I'm cold.

Kang-woo says he's cold!

Thank you very much.

I'm losing so much.

Instead of the hot water bag!

I'm going down to get
the lights in the store.

Don't you love our Mahjong gang?

Wednesdays. Mercury. Water.

Oasis! How's that
for our gang's name?

She's a Catholic Veronica.

She was in a bad hit-and-run.

Lost a lot of blood.

She doesn't have much time.

Let this water call to mind
your baptismal sharingâ€¦

in Christ's redeeming
passion and resurrection.

Veronica. Make your confession.

By the power the apostolic See
has given me in the name of theâ€¦

Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I grant you

a plenary indulgence andâ€¦

pardon for all your sins.

Amen.

Through this holy anointingâ€¦

may the Lord in his
love and mercy help youâ€¦

with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

Andâ€¦

may the Lord who
frees you from sinâ€¦

save you and raise you up.

Amen.

Where'd you wander
off to this time?

I woke up I was at the pharmacy.

And some man walked past.

Aren't there pills
for sleepwalking?

I should lock your room
from the outside.

Should've got me pills
for my cold.

Weren't you cold?

You never catch a cold.

She's a Yeti, Mom.

Smells like
when you had gastritis.

I'll go find the pills.

Must you do this to believe me?

Don't grab my heart so hard.

When I drank Hyo-sung's bloodâ€¦

the blisters disappeared.

It's as if the vampire cells
suppressed EV.

But, it doesn't last very long.

Fatherâ€¦

I didn't choose the blood
that was transfused into me!

You know I went
there to do good!

Now, I thirst after
all sinful pleasures.

But how can I get human
blood without killing!

Firstâ€¦

The Lord said not to worry
about what to eat.

For He feeds even
the birds in the sky.

Here.

I think I won.

Small four winds!

Closed, half flush,
bonus 3 points!

30 bucks! You lose!

Some priest.
From Macao or something?

He's the only one
who survived out of 500.

500, yeah right.

When did you go out?

I didn't see you.

It's ahâ€¦
kind of an infectious disease.

Scary, isn't it?

How differentâ€¦
without his glasses.

How can you get infected?

Not through a kiss for sure.

I never kissed
anyone in my life.

Until now.

I don't get shy.

I didn't run out cuz I'm shy.

Back in Busanâ€¦

It's cuz I was
sick of everything.

The mom, idiot son,
and the dark, damp house.

The non-stop weepy, old songs.

I waited for you to come.

The orphanage boyâ€¦

I waited for youâ€¦

when I was youngâ€¦

cuz the idiot liked you.

When you came,
he left me alone.

I'm not a shy person.

I run out on my bare feetâ€¦

to escape from
this hell sooner.

I even run out from my sleep.

They think its sleepwalking.

I feel awake only then
and asleep the rest of the time.

Honey!

Tae-ju!

Hot water bag!

Tae-ju?

Tae-ju!

You bitch!

There she goes again.

I fed you and raised you!

Go put her to bed!

You can't even change
your husband's hot water bag?

How dare you!

I win.

Let go!

Stomach troubles?
What took you so long?

Eat up other's money
and you'll get diarrhea.

What's got into you?

This looks fun.

So exciting to touch.

I could do it all night, too.

You don't even know
how to do it.

Me?

I know how to do it.

I'm good.

They are on fire!

I can't wait till next Wednesday.

Then how about Sundays, too?

Why not?

Wellâ€¦

It's Easter Sunday
I'm staying at the hospital.

It's best to leave things
in wanting.

Momâ€¦

Iâ€¦

can't live like this anymore.

Iâ€¦

I want to help the needy.

Maybe I can volunteer
at a hospital or something.

On Sundays.

Thank you for coming.

Don't come again.

But I came to help the needy.

Its a bigger sin for a priest.

I'm not Catholic.

To me, you're just a needy,
single man.

We can both go to hell for this.

I don't have faith
I'm not going to hell.

But Iâ€¦

I have a terrible disease.

I'm too damn healthy.

Just once,
I wish I could be sick in bed.

It's okay.

Hyo-sung's in a coma.

Unless his vitals drop
no one will come in here at nights.

Sorry, I hurt you.

No, its good.

Its strange, but good.

Is it supposed to
feel this good?

What's wrong with me?

Are other women like this?

Am I a pervert?

Did you eat?

Ah, yes.

Can we meet
during the day next week?

Daytimes a bitâ€¦

We could be together longer.

I don't want to keep my disease
a secret from you.

I amâ€¦

a kind of aâ€¦

I don't kill anyone you know.

Hyo-sungâ€¦

He loved helping the hungry.

He'd offer me his blood,
if he wasn't in a coma.

If you only heard
the sponge cake story.

No one blames someone
for getting hurt in an accident!

No one gets criticized
for having cancer!

I went there to do good!

So what if I'm a vampire?

Did you like me cuz I'm a priest?

Its not that, is it?
That's just my job.

Being a vampire is
like having different palatesâ€¦

or different biorhythms
don't you think?

When two people are in love,
does it really matter?

No, what I mean isâ€¦

You hate that I'm a vampire?

Think I could've slept
with you if I wasn't?

How could I have sex with you?

As just a priest?

Come with me.

I'll take you away from this hell.

You liked doing it with me
Kang-woo's no fun.

Tae-ju?

What's going on?

The toilet's not flushing.

It's going down now.

Closing time.

Hello?

<i>How canâ€¦</i>

someone become a vampire?

Can you catch it through sex?

Can you turn me into one?

Vampires areâ€¦
cuter than I thought.

Can you bend this?

What for?

Can you jump down from here?

Too high?

I'm ready.

Did Kang-woo do that?

Does he hurt you often?

Not oftenâ€¦

Want me to rip him up
like that coin?

I lived as their dog
my whole lifeâ€¦

feeding the idiot, washing him
and even helping him masturbate.

You knowâ€¦

I'm practically a virgin.

He'sâ€¦

Does it hurt?

Can't you volunteer
somewhere else?

Mental hospitals are so scary.

Drink it.

Can't you go back to the lab?

Ask if there's any way
for a cure?

Sunlight is bound to hit me
on my way there.

Sunlightâ€¦

I wish I can see the sunrise
over the sea before I die.

What are you thinking!

Vampires can't see the sunlight!

I don't care if it's at night.

The moon, the stars
and even a fireflyâ€¦

Be the miracle worker!

Make the blind see!

Give me the vampire blood!

It even killed EV!

Please, Sang-hyun!

Come here!

Sang-hyun! Father Hyun!

Please!

Just a little bit, please?

I'm no longer
a priest nor a friar.

Forget the rules!
Forget the Vatican!

I'm leaving!

Father Hyun! Father Hyun!

I don't know
why you wandered astray.

But I know you'll get through this.

I took pity on you
when you were young.

We had you over for noodles.

You can stay here
as long as you want.

Thank you.

Tae-juâ€¦

She's really good at heart.

I'm giving the shop
and everything to her.

Did I do it too hard?

It's perfect.

One more time, then?

Good night.

Sweet dreams.

Get out! Go!

Hurry!

Go! Someone will see you!

No! Don't!

â™ª <i>The seagulls flying
in the distanceâ€¦</i>

â™ª <i>I called, but no response.</i>

â™ª <i>O, my hometown by the waters
where bright blue stars glistenâ€¦</i>

â™ª <i>in my dreams full of sorrow.</i>

Remember Tae-ju
when she was young?

Wasn't she cute?

When she was 12

she woke me up
and showed me her panties.

Said she peed blood.

Cuz mom worked her day
and night with needlework.

We cried together all night.

Planning on taking all night?

It's only 9 o'clock.

The hospital and police questioning
will take hours.

What if the sun comes up?

I said, no!

Just a little bit?

They'll find out with an autopsy!

Why go somewhere else
for blood?

We have blood right here.

Put the knife down.

Yeah, put it down.

No! Don't come near me!

One female. Unconscious.
Well be going soon.

Don't mention
that I let you fish here.

I'll take care of everything.

Father Hyunâ€¦ Fatherâ€¦

He became ill again for our sins!

Grant me the following

in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

Like a cripple without limbs

let me not move freely.

Remove my cheeks

that tears may
not roll down them.

There was a house
at the bottom of the lake.

A submerged village.

I thought he was dead.

But when I went up
he'd float up, too.

So I put him in a closet
in the house

and a big rock on his chest.

What if he comes out
and chases me?

I should've put a rock
at the closet door, too.

Death is the end. Right Father?

When you're dead, you're dead?

See?

Vampires are not immortal.

You still want my blood?

You want to see
this dark world that badly?

You live on other's blood

but won't give me
a drop of yours!

Give me absolution and
I'll give it to you.

God the Father of mercies,
has reconciled the world to himself

through the death
and resurrection of his Sonâ€¦

and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;

through the ministry of the Church

may God give you
pardon and peaceâ€¦

and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Fatherâ€¦

and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

Let us praise the Lord.

The Lord's mercy endures forever.

The Lord has forgiven your sins.

Go home and rest.

You must be tired.

She's my only friend.

I know shell get better
if you pray for her.

Please.

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

I pray to Tae-ju.

Please wake up
and listen to my prayer.

I said Kang-woo was drunk
from a bottle of So-ju.

So say the same to the cops.

When this is all over
we will be together.

We must not meet for a while.

Though my face may seem
cold and rigidâ€¦

my heart only beats for you.

<i>When we meet again
I believe we'll finally be happy.</i>

<i>Father?</i>

<i>Doing it this wayâ€¦</i>

<i>feels like I'll live on inside you.</i>

Stop all theâ€¦

thinking, longing.

The police needs the body
to close the case.

Kang-woo couldn't swim, Mrs Ra
You gotta move on with your life.

Kang-woo can swim.

Father Hyun's still not
taking calls?

It must've been a big shock.

Still, he could've come
to the funeral.

Kang-woo!

Kang-woo!

I'm Sang-hyun, Ma'am.

I know I'm all wet butâ€¦

My poor baby.

What took you so long?

Why didn't you call?

Bastard! You son of a bitch!

â€“Mrs Ra!
â€“Mrs Ra!

Wake up Mrs Ra!

Drink this, Mrs Ra!

This is why we should all watch
our blood pressures.

Watch our drinking.

And stay away from salty foods.

Let's give Mrs Ra
our positive energy, Oasis-style.

Starting with Tae-ju.

Momâ€¦

How long's it been?

Why are you so wet?

What?

Is there a leak?

Whys it so damp?

Come here and
stop imagining things.

It's all psychological.

Stop making a fuss
and will you come here?

Was he here, too?

He? Who?

â™ª <i>Seagulls flying
in the distanceâ€¦</i>

Don't fall for it.

It's all just an illusion.

It's just psychological.

You're going?

How can someone do it
five times, straight?

Mom never once
threw me a birthday party.

How dare you!

But she always gave me
plenty to eat.

Then thank her.

Thank you.

Can't you go to that detective?

Aren't you thirsty these days?

I'll throw you
a birthday party this year.

Really?

The first birthday party
in my life?

Butâ€¦ I don't know
when my birthday is.

But who made you boss?

Telling me this and that

and hitting me around.

Kang-woo never laid
a hand on me.

Did Kang-wooâ€¦

beat you or not?

Why does that matter?

That's why he died!

Don't make excuses!

You would've killed him anyway.

So you can have me for yourself.

Do you know how hard
I tried not to kill people?

You can't even begin to imagine!

A blood thirsty beast
is growling inside me!

But I tiptoed around
afraid to hurt anyone.

I killed him cuz of you.

To save you.

To save me?

Then why am I living
a nightmare?

I stay up trembling
at the thought of

your cold hand touching me.

How did this happen?

Mom!

Mom!

I'm done for.

He's going to kill me.

Poor Kang-wooâ€¦

My poor, dear momâ€¦

You treated that devil like a son
and this is what you get?

Did I do it alone?

It was your idea.

No! It was his idea!

He said he'll kill
the mother and son!

Honest!

I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

We were a happy family of three
till you infested us!

You're a germ!

You said I was cute, you cunt!

Mommy, mommyâ€¦

Look at me.

You can't die like this.

Mom.

Tell me you forgive me.

Momâ€¦

Look at me.

If you forgive me blink once.

Just one blink? Please?

Just once? Please?

Let's go!

That devil will suck
all the blood out of you, too!

Let go!

Let go!

Stay back you devil!

I want to go to Kang-woo.

Kill me, please.

You want to go?

Go to your husband?

Really?

Happy birthday, Tae-ju.

Completely white
just like daylight.

That's a good girl.

From now on, we wear shoes
inside the house like in the States.

Cuz I'm in charge, now.

You have to
sleep during the day, too.

And eat at nightâ€¦

Did you just move?

Watch TV while I'm out.

A scary movies gonna be on.

I'm not ashamed at all!

I told you!

I'll get the blood!

Stealing from the hospital?

â€“There's more.
â€“What?

I'm helping people
who want to commit suicide.

I know many people like that
from listening to confessions.

If I run out, I'll find more
through the Internet.

They face death more peacefully
if I help them.

If they just give it to you,
what fun is that?

It tastes much better this way.

How many has to die
for your taste?

Maybe around 500?
How's that, Father?

I told you
I'm not a Father anymore!

Oh dear, the Father is mad.

Stop acting so humane!
You're not even human.

Then what are we?

We're human-eating beasts
that's what!

Is it a sin for a fox
to eat a chicken?

Don't make me regret
saving you.

Kill me or save me
you'll regret either way.

We're through!

I dump him
and he drops me like this?

You're the only one
I've got, now.

You said women are
safe from EV.

Your blood is completely
mixed with mine.

Then, I'm no longer
a woman?

Hold on.

I'll get a doctor.

Hello?

How do you feelâ€¦

Tae-juâ€¦

What day is it today?

The eyes are so telling.

They can express everything
between yes and no.

What good is just a yes or no?

You need a subject and verb
to communicate.

The subject is
what's being stared at.

If you stare at something
for over 4 secondsâ€¦

others will automatically
turn to look, too.

Is that a published theory?

Haven't had the chance yet.

I'm an expert at reading the eyes
after 2 years of marriage

That's why her Korean's
not improving.

Can you tell
what mom's saying?

That's what I'm talking about!

Tae-ju just saw me
peek over at Mrs Ra.

She knew what I was going to say,
before I said it.

By glancing at my eyes.

Mrs Ra said I'd win
if I took this piece.

And that she wants
some Vodka.

Vodka!

I win!

Closed, Self-draw,
bonus 3 points,

Big three dragons!

See that?

Thank you, Mrs Ra.

You want to play that bad?

How about teaming her up
with Evelyn?

If you blink it means â€œyesâ€.

A long blink means â€œnoâ€.

Okay?

Blink if you understand.

Throw it away.

Mrs Ra is back!

Evelyn? Vodka.

â€œDâ€.

â€œDâ€, what?

You can move
your finger, mom?

What's wrong with your nail?

â€œLâ€.â€‰It's another letter!

What?

â€œL, Dâ€.

Or â€œD, Lâ€?

â€œDâ€â€‰comes last, â€œLDâ€.

Maybe she wants theâ€‰â€œLCDâ€â€‰on?

There's probably
a â€œCâ€â€‰somewhere.

â€œCâ€â€¦

Found it!

â€“â€œKâ€!
â€“â€œKâ€?

LDK?

Ladies Delaying,
Killing the game.

â€œDâ€â€‰comes last! â€œKLDâ€!

Mrs Ra, it's â€œDKLâ€, right?

She says, no.

â€œKLDâ€? â€œKILLEDâ€?

I'm right?

See? It's â€œKILLEDâ€!

Whatever, let's keep
the game alive.

â€“Whose turn is it?
â€“Killed who?

Mahjong brings back
memories of Kang-woo?

Momâ€¦Â it's not your fault.

He didn't die cuz of you.

Stop playing and go to bed.

Tae-ju's so strong.

Stop torturing yourself

Look at me, Mrs Ra.

It was an accident.

No one killed Kang-woo.

It's not like Tae-ju
and Sang-hyun killedâ€¦

Selfish humans.

Bastards coming to play Mahjong
with a grieving family

What?

Why you little shit.

I'm leaving,
cuz shit smells not scares.

Honey! No!

Oh, Young-du.

Young-du!

Stop it.

You easy-blood drinking coward.

It's cuz he's dead
and the heart stopped pumping.

Cut off the ankles andâ€¦

hang them over the bathtub
and let gravity do the rest.

<i>We can put the blood in Tupperware
and keep it in the fridge</i>

I thought of using a motor pump
but this works best.

Sucking a little
and throwing the body away is

treating life too lightly, isn't it?

Evelynâ€¦

How could I have made
all those Kimbaps without you?

It's over now.

Happy?

Tae-ju.

Listen to me carefully.

Why do I have to run away?

From my own house?

Wont they search the house
when they find the 4 people missing?

They'll come in here
without dusting off their shoes?

Search the house, open the cabinet
and open the curtainsâ€¦

Then well die?

What are you doing?

You already had your fill.

Where are we going?

Where are you going?

The sun's coming up!

Didn't you have your fill
from Evelyn?

I wanted to live
with you forever and ever.

Together again in hell then.

When you're dead, you're dead.

It's been fun, Father
