(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

(EXPLOSION)
(GRUNTING)

Get out of the car! Get out!
Satchel, come on, we have to go.

We have to move. Come on.

HUNTER: Get down!
(EXPLOSION)

Go! Go, go, go!
(WHOOSHING)

JENNIFER: Satchel? Are you okay?

Are you okay? Oh, my God.

Come here.
(CRYING) Oh, my God.

I can't see.

JENNIFER: What? Satchel?
I can't see!

Oh, Satchel... Is he okay?

Keep your eyes closed, all right?

Don't look at anything. It's
just gonna hurt your eyes.

Okay.
Satchel?

Come here.

It's okay. I've got you.
We need to get off the road and find shelter.

We can't do that on foot.

JENNIFER: I need to call our
family, let them know we're okay.

HUNTER: Cell phones won't work.

Nothing electronic will.
Why did this happen?

HUNTER: That's not important now.

We only have an hour or so before
the radiation starts coming in.

Food, water, supplies, a diesel
vehicle are the priority.

JENNIFER: Well, what about the Interstate?
We could, uh, find someone to help us.

HUNTER: No. We need to stay
away from populated areas

until we know what's going on.

JENNIFER: Oh, fine.

Come here.
Here, hold this, okay? Just stay right here.

All right.

Hold this, right there.



Hey, see if you can find me a screwdriver.
Okay. All right.

Perfect.

Hopefully this works,
Jennifer and Satchel.

Let's see if this
thing has some gas.

(ENGINE CHOKING AND STARTING)

Hop on in.
JENNIFER: Great.

Here. Follow me, okay?

(HUNTER GRUNTING)

I... I still can't see.

Is, uh... Is this normal?

Yeah, you'll be all right.

Come on, come on.

SATCHEL: Where you going?
Okay, okay.

All right, I need you to find bottled
water, tuna, peanut butter, um,

beef jerky. Anything high
in protein, all right?

No junk food, no empty calories.

No, stay in the car.
Stay in the car.

Find any kind of batteries you can.
Um, baby wipes. We need baby wipes.

Okay... Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay? Let's go.

Where are you headed?
Waco. My car won't start.

How many did you see go off?

There were two to the east,

by the Dyess air base in Abilene.

One to the north. Uh, I don't
know, maybe Oklahoma City...

And a whole bunch of huge ones to
the south. Probably Dallas, Fort Worth.

They really got us this
time, didn't they?

Look, we need to get somewhere
safe. You can hop in the back.

Okay.

Hello? (POUNDING)

Hello?

BOY: Please go away. Go away.
No, no, no. We just need to find a basement.

(GUN FIRING)
Oh, my God!

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Holy shit!
HUNTER: Go, go, go!

ELIZABETH:
Are you okay? Are you shot?

HUNTER: Just go! Come on.
We got to get out of here!

Hey!
ELIZABETH: I know what you're looking for.

ELIZABETH: What about this place?

HUNTER: We're running out
of time. It'll have to do.

Where are we?
It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be all right.

Hello?

Hey.

Hey.

Don't shoot.
Get the fuck out of here.

I'm a fucking doctor. Okay?

Come on, Mr. Franklins.
He said he was a doctor.

(GUN FIRING)
(GASPING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Now, I've been shot once today
and I'm not gonna be shot again!

Now, we have our own food
and we have a lot of water.

We just need a place
to stay. And I'm a doctor.

I can help you.
Brad, just let him in!

He said he had food.

We got our own water.

We got a water pump!

If you have a water
pump, it's well water.

It will be irradiated soon.
It's not gonna be safe.

Look,

I got a sick kid and his sister in the
truck. You have a cellar, right?

That's where we've been staying

since the nukes went off.

Get them down there and stay.
Okay.

My name's Jonathan.

Okay.

Is your cellar over there?
Look, Elizabeth, come here.


All right, we need to cover this with
dirt. Pull the truck around back.

Anything else around
there, all right?

Just get the shovels
out and cover them.

Can you do that?
Yeah.

Look, all the food and water
I have is in the truck.

It needs to be in the cellar, now.

What's your name? Angie.
Angie.

I need you to go upstairs,
like, go in the bathrooms,

get all the towels, all the clothes. Get
them down into the cellar, all right?

Okay. I'll get everything.

HUNTER: Hey.
JONATHAN: Yeah.

We need more shovels, all right?

Okay, yeah, I have
one in the cellar.

Whose house is this?

It's my grandma and
grandpa's house.

Where are they?
Oh, uh, my grandpa has leukemia,

so he's at Dallas at the hospital.

Grandma's with him, but...

They're probably dead by now.
(BRAD TITTERING) I'm sorry.

I'm just kidding. They're
dead! That's for sure.

Could you stop being
an asshole and dig?

Bitch.

Charming.

Who's the moron?

He's our neighbor.

They don't have a cellar, because a lot
of people around here don't have cellars.

But we have a cellar, so...

ELIZABETH: Great.

Angie, right?
I got all the towels.

I don't think there's
any more up here.

How far along are you?

About seven months.

A little more than that.
Like eleven days or so.

Hey, hold on.

Let me see that.

That's fine.

All right, give the, uh...

Give the medicine to the blonde
woman I came with. The calm one.


Hey, do you think he's gonna be okay...
Yeah, he's fine.

Is that everything?

Truck's empty. What?

(LOUD THUDDING)
Relax.


(BREATHING HEAVILY)


(GROANS IN PAIN)


(QUAVERING GROAN)


(BREATHING HEAVILY)


(EXHALES SHARPLY)

Thank God I'm in Texas.

(SIGHS PAINFULLY)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(WHEEZING COUGH)

This is my granduncle, Wendell.

He lives with us now

because we couldn't afford a
home for him after the VA cuts.

WENDELL: Pleased to meet you, sir.

Listen, Doc, uh, he's a diabetic.

(COUGHING)
We have insulin, but we might...

Don't worry about it.
Here.

We got all the food and water down.

HUNTER: You have some more
kerosene lamps upstairs.

We need them down here.

Those are Grandma's. She's
really into that antique stuff.

But we gotta make sure that
we don't break any of it

'cause if she comes back, then, um...
BRAD: Doc...

(CLEARS THROAT) Doc.

I got a question. You, uh,
took my pistol, remember?

Yeah, don't worry
about it. I still got it.

Yeah, so do I get a gun?

Tell you what, you go a week without
shooting at me again and I'll think about it.

(LOW BUZZING)

Well! That's real nice.

Sure good to be able to
see everybody's faces.

Yeah, but there's only, uh, three car
batteries, so we have to conserve.

How long do we have
to stay down here?

We are never gettin'
out of here, honey.

At least a month.

Depends how widespread all this is.

The, uh, blast radiation isn't good,
but the fallout is a bigger problem.

When a nuclear bomb goes off,
it sucks up dirt and debris into the air

that falls back down like snow.

It's really radioactive,
and it's a particulate.

You... You breathe it in.

BRAD: (LAUGHS) Oh, my God, dude!

Watch out, guys! We can't even
fucking breathe in here now!

JONATHAN:
I was watching Fox News and

it sounded like it was
pretty widespread.

Well, I knew about that
magnopulse thing, so I...

I put my mp3 player in the safe so that
we at least have some music to listen to.

I know these things went off all
over Asia and North America.

A lot in Europe, too, but I don't know
how widespread the radiation is.

I saw at least five of them go off.

But there's no way of knowing how
many megatons the bombs were...

Uh, the wind direction
at the time of blast...

I have a shortwave right
here that I'm working on.

But...

It might be broken, though.
(SIGHS)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Grandpa's a pretty big military collector.

I don't know what all's in there.

He never really lets me mess
with any of that stuff.

Start nailing up the
cellar doors shut.

And if you have any tape,
seal up the cracks.

BRAD: God damn it, man!

You haven't gotten this shit all
off the fucking shelf? Man, Jesus!

Gotta take boxes off it!
Sorry.

Fucking Poindexter, man!
Get this fucking thing off!

Fuck!

What are you doing, man? Get a hammer!
JONATHAN: I'm sorry. Here.

Hey. Here.

What is that?

It's a Geiger counter.
It measures radiation.

Well, the door's boarded tight.
Shh!

(SOFT CLICKING)

(CLICKING LOUDER)

The fallout.

(CLICKING INCREASES)

(CLICKING RAPIDLY)

(CLICKING EXTREMELY FAST)

Are you fucking crazy?

You're gonna make my wife
piss in a goddamn bucket?

Come on, Mr. Franklins. You
know we can't go upstairs.

Hey, Professor Oppenheimer,
this is the best we can do.

I don't know if you've noticed,
but we don't have a toilet.

Kerosene is less dense than water,
urine, or shit, so it'll stay on top.

All right, you can go in.

(DOOR CLOSING)

And thank you.
You're welcome.

HUNTER: (EXHALES) Maybe you should
try fixing the, uh, shortwave radio.

JONATHAN: Okay.

ELIZABETH: (SOFTLY)
Is he gonna be okay?

His retinas were too badly burned in
the blast. He was looking directly at it.

(ELIZABETH SIGHS)

Do you think we should tell him?
I mean, he's been asking me.

I'm gonna go check on Angie.

(GRUNTS AND SIGHS)

Here, baby.

I'm tired. Oh, shit.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Oh, great.

Hey.

How you doing?
I'm okay.

Do you mind if I listen for a heartbeat?
Yeah, sure.

Okay.

You mind taking a deep breath for me?
(INHALES DEEPLY)

There we go.

BRAD: She's cool, right?

Right?

You look a little
young to be a M.D.

What are you doing around here?

I was finishing my residency
at New York University.

Wow!

New York!


I'm not doing anything?
I'm just curious.

What are you doing around these parts?
You... I saw your backpack.

You on a walkabout or something?

Yeah, something like that.

Jesus.

All right, stay...
Stay warm, honey.

ANGIE: Thank you.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

We need to drink a bottle of
water and try to get some sleep.

And cover up as much as possible.
(SCOFFS) That's...

Brad, please.

Can we just go to sleep?
I don't feel very well.

(ANGIE SNIFFLES)

Hey, Jonathan. Should I be
worried about those two?

I don't know.

Sometimes, she'll come over
here to talk to Grandma...

And she's always, like, crying.

Oh...

Oh, um, I got the, um, shortwave
working. Well, kind of.

You can use my earphones,
but you can only just listen.

The microphone's not connected yet.

Uh, I'm gonna go tuck in Grand Unc.

Night.
Good night.

(SNORING LIGHTLY)

Here you go, Grand Unc.
Hmm...

Thank you, Jon.

Are you gonna be okay, Grand Unc?

I sure hope my brother's
okay out there.

Ah, he'll be all right.
He's a war hero. (LAUGHS)


You should've seen him.
Grandpa, Jonathan.

He was the reason I
volunteered for Korea.

That was a different war.

I'm gonna be sleeping behind you, okay?
Hmm... Hmm...

So if you need anything...

ELIZABETH:
Brad's gonna be a problem.

(HUNTER GRUNTING)


<i>MAN ON RADIO: "We are the hollow men

(LOW BUZZING)


Satchel?
Hmm?

You okay?
Mmm-hmm. Where are we?

What?

JENNIFER: Drink some more, okay?
SATCHEL: Okay.

It's right here. It's a bottle.

What time is it? Does anybody know?

JONATHAN: Uh, yeah, it's 11:23 a.m.

Shit. That's what I have, too.

What do you mean, "shit"?

It's almost completely
dark outside.

BRAD: What?

It's, like, noon.

HUNTER: Yeah. Look for yourself.

That doesn't make any sense.

It's the end of the world.

What did you say?

I said, "It's the
end of the world."

You know what?

You shut the fuck
up with that shit!

My fucking pregnant wife is right here.
(COUGHING)

Stop with all this fucking "left
for us" bullshit, all right?

You leave that to your own
psycho head, all right?

(COUGHING LOUDER)

SATCHEL: Don't talk to my sister like that!
HUNTER: Hey, enough.

All right? We're not gonna
get anywhere like that.

It's not gonna help
this day be any better.

Hey, Doc.

How you doing, Wendell?
You doing all right?

Ah, I'm all right.

Just a little tired from all of the excitement.
Let me check something out.

I can't complain.

You're doing all right.

Ah...

HUNTER: What have you got there?

Um, when this all started, I was
talking to my best friend Barry

in Minnesota over IM.

And he's the one who told me
about the magnetic pulse thing.

He said I might be able
to save some of my stuff

if I put it in a metal
safe or something.

I don't know, man.
Maybe if it was lead.

(STATIC)
This radio still works.

And, um, I put some of my
grandpa's .38 lead rounds in here.


Here's the best part.


Still works.

Well, that should help
you pass the time.

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

Really, uh...

It just doesn't make any
sense, though. I mean...

It's just dark,
you know? This is...

This is Texas, man! It's, like...

It's, like, 55 degrees
in this shit. (SIGHS)

You know what I think?

The government, man...
They've gotta have, like...

There is no government.
...something up their sleeve.

There is no government
anymore, Brad!

So many of those
things have gone off

that we can't even fucking
see the sun anymore!

Look, there's always a
government, all right?

Somebody did this to us!

I wanna find out if we did
anything back to them!

Who the fuck cares?

Hunter and I were on the
shortwave last night,

and everybody is going through the
exact same thing we are, okay?

Fucking bitch! I wanna know
what the President did!

I wanna know. I wanna know
what we're doing... Fuck! Ouch!

Get off of me!
Hey, listen...

Listen. Listen, all right?
(CHATTERING ON RADIO)

We're not gonna get anywhere

That was really fun.

What's that?

Nowhere to go but up.

You're pretty right, there, Doc.

ELIZABETH: Give me.

JONATHAN: I got you. I got you.

Lay him down.
BRAD: Fuck!

I'm so sorry, Rob. I didn't know...

Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

I'm so sorry, Rob!

Huh?
HUNTER: Okay, just let me deal with him!


HUNTER: Jonathan, get out
of here. Let me deal with him.

I didn't know it
was you. I'm so sorry.

HUNTER: Everybody stop apologizing!

Rob, you're in shock.
(WHIMPERING)

I need you to just look at me
right here, okay? Let me see this.

BRAD: Who is this guy?
HUNTER: Let me see this.

Elizabeth, can you hold this? Thank you.
Who is he?

I asked you a fucking question! Huh?
Get off of him!

HUNTER:
I need to look at your wrist.

He's my friend. He works at the
comic book shop on Redford.

HUNTER:
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!

(GROANING)
HUNTER: Rob...

Hey, Rob, Listen to me, all right?
The bullet went through your wrist.

That's good. That means I'm not
gonna have to remove a bullet.

I'm just gonna have to dress
your wound and clean it.

ROB: They're shooting people...

They're shooting people!

Hey... Hey!
They're shooting people!

Hold him down! Hold him down!
(ALL CLAMORING)

Fuck!


Thanks.

Here, Rob. Drink this slowly, okay?

ROB: (MEEKLY) I don't want it.

Have they... Uh, the town,
have they set up any, um,

evacuation centers or
anything like that?

They tried.

They used the old, uh,

fallout shelter under the library,

but it didn't fit everybody.

There was a lot of fighting.

BRAD: What about the Guard?

ELIZABETH: The National Guard?

They're all overseas.

Isn't good out there.

Started with a lot of looting.

Then the bubbas took over

'cause they had the guns.

Second night, there
was a string of rapes.

And they're not letting the
old people have any food.

A lot of people are in
bad shape, all burnt up.

A lot of people
getting really drunk.

Others are going crazy looking for
alcohol and drugs because they ran out.

When did the bruises
first appear, Rob?

They shot all the migrants.

That's when I ran.

They just lined them
up and shot 'em.

Everybody's going crazy and...

That's why I came here.

I was so worried about you, Rob.

You know, with Grandpa
and Grandma and Barry...

...all dead.

Please, you gotta let me stay.

I'm...

All the real sick people, they're...
They're straggling around the town,

looking for food and water, but...

I got my own bottle of water and peanut
butter in my backpack upstairs, okay?

I won't even use your
food, I promise.

Please?

I don't wanna go back out there.

This is Jonathan's home, and if he
says you can stay, you can stay.

ELIZABETH: Okay?
Thank you.

BRAD: Shut up!
(SHUSHING)

HUNTER:
It's just the radiation setting in.

I'm gonna give you two amoxicillins.
It should help you fight it off.

HUNTER: Hey, Brad.
What?

Is she okay?
She's... She's fine.

She's just got a little
morning sickness.

(ANGIE STILL COUGHING)

Angie, have you been able to eat anything?
ANGIE: Not much.

BRAD: Man, she's fine. It's just harder
for her. She's gotta eat for two.

Right, sweetheart?
(ANGIE STILL COUGHING)

BRAD: Hey, honey!

She's okay.

What the fuck! Hey... Hey,
sweetheart. Sweetheart, come on.

Come on. You're okay! Just breathe!

Angie, breathe. Come on!
You're hurting the baby! Stop!

ANGIE: (CRYING) Stop.

BRAD: All right? Please!

It's okay! Just breathe!

Breathe! You're hurting the

(CRYING) Stop! Stop it!
Please!

BRAD: (SOFTLY) Oh, my God!
ANGIE: What?

What? What are you guys looking at?
Ange...

What?

Stop. What's wrong with my face?

BRAD: Ange...

Stop, Brad! You're freaking me out!

What is wrong with my face? What?
It's okay, it's okay.

BRAD: It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry.

Stay calm. Jennifer?

(GUN FIRING)

JONATHAN: Oh, my God! (WHIMPERING)


I'm keeping the gun.

JONATHAN:
Am I gonna die because she bit me?

She was scared, okay?

She was scared of blast burn
and radiation poisoning,

and she was dying and...

She's a refugee of this war.
She's not a movie zombie, okay?

(BRAD SCOFFS)

Could have fooled me.
HUNTER: Let me see this.

What are we gonna do about her?

Well, Brad and I are gonna take
her upstairs to the top floor.

But I'm gonna wait for the
radiation to die down a little bit

before we do that.

ELIZABETH: (READING) "The soldier
now blew upon a green whistle,

pretty green silk gown, entered the room.

"'Follow me and I will

"So Dorothy said goodbye to all
her friends except for Toto,

Hey, Grand...

Just...

Just go.


Just go.


(ELIZABETH SOBBING)

ROB: You keep trying to be the
savior, Doc, and all that guilt,

it's gonna eat up your soul.

You kept the man as
comfortable as you could.

You better accept what's
gonna happen to us all.

You keep swinging from
the rafters like that,

you're liable to dirty up your
spirit for when you meet your Maker.

I'll keep that in mind.


Jonathan is insisting
that we bury Wendell.

(HUNTER LAUGHS)

Absolutely not.

The radiation is falling a little
bit, but it's still off the charts.

(ROB LAUGHS)

That's what I'm talking about, Doc.

That boy just wants to
do right by his kin.

He's gonna join him soon enough.

It'd be best if you
just let him do it.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

I'm gonna take a little nap.

Then I'm gonna help that
boy bury his granduncle.

Brad!

Quiet! They can hear us.

You know what?

Remember in the back?
There's, like, a water pump...

HUNTER: No, no, the water's the
most contaminated thing around.

It wouldn't be safe.

Hey, Jonathan. I'm sorry.

If you wanna say something...

ELIZABETH: Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, boy... Oh, boy, we gotta go!

Go, go, go!
Oh, shit! Oh, God! You guys...

What's wrong with her?
She miscarried.

Get her to the fucking table!

Jonathan, bring me a pillow.

You're okay. She's okay, right?

Honey. Honey. Look... (SHUSHING)

Everything's gonna be fine, right?
I need to get in here.

ELIZABETH:
I need some towels or something.

She's losing way too much blood.
I need to do a transfusion.

BRAD: Help her, man!
I don't have a way of doing a trans...

There's nothing I can do.
She needs a transfusion, Brad.

There's nothing I can do!

What are you saying there's
nothing you can do? Come on, man.

Fucking help her, man. Please!

Brad, no, you're not listening.
There's nothing I can do!

No, no, no!
She needs a transfusion!

Do you have a sewing kit?

Yeah, my grandma's.
Get me a sewing kit. I need a pot.

All right, I got this.

If you don't save her, I'll kill you!
Get alcohol.

I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

I... I need my bag.

We would all be dead

How are we gonna get
his body out of here?

I mean, there's just more and
more of those people out there.

No, we... We can't
take him outside.

We'll just have to bury him
up in the attic with Angie.

No.

I'll take him up.

Sorry, Rob. You don't have the strength
to carry him. I'm not gonna let you.

No, Doc, I...

Let me do this.

Okay, I owe you. I owe all of you.

If someone's gonna risk
themselves, it should be me.

Now, you always...

You've always kept us sensible.
This is the sensible thing.

I mean, look at me. I'm not

Why can't he just talk to us?

JENNIFER: Let's face it.
We never had a chance.

This all was over before we even got here.
Great.

So what are we even doing?

Why are we even still here?
Why don't we just give up?
