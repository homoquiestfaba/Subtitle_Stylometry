<b>WELL WISHES</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

Tails!

You wanted to see me, sir?

Yes...

Come on in, Mike.

It's Miles, sir.

Miles?

Are you sure it's not Mike?
I could have sworn it was Mike.

I'm pretty sure.

Okay.

Well take a seat, duly noted.

I'm gonna cut right
to the chase here.

I got some bad news.

We're gonna have to let you go.

I don't understand that, sir.

Is it because of
the Christmas party?

Because I apologize
for my girlfriend.

If it makes any difference, we
received one hell of a rash

from that mistletoe.

No, I thought
that was pretty funny.

But no.
Okay.

This is...

This is just...

What about everything I've
done for this company?

You know, it's
strictly financial,

and I am sorry if this...

If you're screwed by
this, I really am.

But on behalf of the entire
staff, I'd like to invite you

to continue attending
our bi-annual bake-off,

both spring and autumn
sweet and savory categories,

best dish wins a gift certificate
to McGillicutty's Seafood!

Shack.

Did you just decide all
this with that quarter?

What quarter?

Sir, the quarter. You
were just tapping it.

It's in your hand.

It's right in your
hand, right here.

Sir, come on.

I don't like
confrontation, Mike.

It's not my strong suit
and if it were up to me,

everybody could keep their jobs.

It is up to you,
sir, you're the boss.

And you're telling me this
is for financial reasons?

I'm the top-earner.

I'm not into
confrontation, okay?

I am sorry.

Just, don't be a stranger.

You go get 'em, slugger.

And could you send Miles in
when you go outside, please?

I'm Miles, Shane.

Send the next guy in.

Thank you.

Have a good one.

Thanks a lot, buddy.

Yes! Yes!

Yes!

Yes!

I would like to
introduce you all

to the new interim
departmental assistant head

of the regional bureau
of synergy assessment

and strategic alignment, woo!

Hey, sweetie.

I'm making a kale quinoa
and couscous salad tonight.

My favorite.

I got laid off today.

You what?

You what?!

Hey.

What happened?

Look at that, baby,
that's beautiful.

Yeah, I know.

I did this for you.

You got all your
favorite colors.

Do you know why
I even did this?

You don't even know
why I did this.

I was gonna tell you
tonight that you could

take my last name
when we get married.

Which is a big deal, Miles.

You're not even acknowledging
how much that means,

and now it's completely
ruined, obviously.

It's not ruined, I just...

Miles! What are you doing?

Miles.

This is not your hook.

This is your hook.

What even happened?

I'm pretty sure he
decided on a coin toss.

That's ridiculous.

No, I'm
pretty sure he did.

I can't even look
at you right now.

What are you doing with
the decorative pillow?

It's in the negative
space, I'm just...

Miles! You're negative space!

They go by color
and pattern, Miles.

I mean, is it hard?

Is it hard? It's not.
I love you.

Don't touch me.

This is just a prime example

of Miles screws everything up!

All the time!

Just keep the candles goin'.

This night is over with.

There's no cuddling, you're
not giving me a back rub.

-Namaste.
-Namaste.

It's seriously like you do
these things on purpose.

"Melissa, it's gonna be so
beautiful when we get married."

Stop talking to me altogether,

because you're
breathing my cat's air,

and wasting it on
your stupid thoughts!

I love you!

"Dear Melissa,"

Pick up the phone and
I'll give you a baby!

"Dear Melissa...

"Dear Melissa...

"Dear Melissa...

"Dear Melissa..."

Golden pepper.

Alright.

Okay.

Come on.

Come on.

Rip off!
Listen.

Lady Liberty.

I sell 'em, I don't
make 'em, all right?

Move along.

No.

Pennies make dollars.

It's common sense!

Jack?

-Coins...
-Yeah.

From wishing wells...?

Yeah.

I'm serious, man.

Listen, all the municipalities,

they don't have enough
budget these days,

to send people out to take
care of the local fountains.

So we can come in, help
out the local governments,

even give more money to charity

than what they typically get.

And then we keep
everything on top of that,

which is gonna be a
nice chunk of change.

We haven't talked in
weeks and you call me up

out of the blue with
this, with a Ponzi scheme?

First up, it's not a
Ponzi scheme, all right?

Second off, I was
embarrassed, man.

Well why would
you be embarrassed?

I should have
called you, I'm sorry.

It's cool. I get it.

Don't apologize.

We can be our own bosses,

then we can go ahead and
enjoy the liberating freedom

we've always talked about.

Is it legal?

Of course it's legal. I've
Googled it, Binged, Yahooed it.

I even asked Jeeves.

Who the hell's Jeeves?

Well, I tried to ask
Jeeves but I don't think

he's around anymore or
else he just goes by Ask.

I must've... missed
the Jeeves train.

Come on, buddy.

You and me?

This is our ticket.

When are you thinking
of starting this thing?

Tonight.

I'm talkin' about
makin' money, man.

Makin' a lot of money.

Do you know how messed
up it is out there?

You should know how
messed up it is out there.

I picked you up wearing a
dress and a foam hat today.

People are struggling
to find jobs.

It is a privilege to have a job.

And I'm glad that
I have one, Miles.

Okay, as much fun as
I know it would be,

I just do not have the stamina

for these kinds
of games anymore.

This is an opportunity,
a legitimate opportunity

with infinite potential.

You sound like
Jerry from work.

Enough about
Jerry, will you stop?

You always talk about Jerry.

Just, "Jerry Jerry Jerry,"
you're like so obsessed

with freakin' Jerry, just,

look at the stars.

Jerry.

Why don't you
just think about it?

Okay.

You're out of your gourd
but I will think about it.

Don't hurt yourself.

Gotta go.
Reach for it!

Reach for the stars, buddy!

Lady Liberty.

Golden Pepper scratch off?

Nope, actually
just a coffee today.

You know what?

Actually I'll take 20 of 'em.

Change?

Yeah, I got some,

I got some change.

I got this too.

Take good care of this, this is

actually what's been keeping
me off the streets too,

if you can believe that, sir.

There you go.

These are for you too.

I don't much play the lottery,

but thank you.

God bless you.

Good luck, sir.

Have we met before?

You look familiar.

Okay.

Well maybe you can help me out.

I'm trying to figure out
where all the fountains are

around here.

Fountains?

Yeah, wishing fountains.

Architectural
enthusiast, are we?

Just a growing interest.

My name is Miles, sir.

Durwood.

Pleasure to meet you, Durwood.

Nice ride.

Thank you, thank you.

It's a '57 wagon, obviously.

I know.

I had a coupe.

Really?

First car.

Yeah?

That's cool.

Yeah, everything's
original in this one.

Interior, engine, all
the numbers are right.

It's been in the
family a long time.

It's been in a good family.

All right well,

I hope you win big with those.

Hey Miles.

Thanks for the generosity.

You take care, sir.

Hi!
Hey.

Brought you a coffee.

Thanks, man.

Come on in, come on in.

You're livin' it up!

Making pillow forts again?

Of course I've been
makin' pillow forts.

Shouldn't you be at work?

If I had a job.

I quit.

Okay, all right.

Why...

Okay, why'd you quit?

I thought
you'd be excited.

No, I just thought
that you liked that job,

what are talkin' about?

Yeah, I did like that job,
or I thought I liked that job,

or I was pretending
to like my job but,

I don't like my job.

I don't like pretending
that Jerry Wunderlick's

jokes are funny, I don't
like the cookie-cutter cards

that I've got to put on
those shelves every day

and they're not letting me
put my own stuff up there?

I'm being artistically
repressed.

That's their loss, Jack.

Then I started thinking about
everything that you've been

saying about creating
something of our own.

Something adventurous,
something unique.

About, the liberating freedom.

And I realized, that's
what I'm missing.

That's what I don't
have, that's what I need.

It's what I want.

So, I mean...

Even if we fail,

I'm in.

Are we gonna do this?

Okay, okay.

Yeah, I'm a big bear.

It's beautiful.
I know, I know.

I had a cousin that
once peed a penny.

Is that weird?

It's not weird
at all, it's money.

I want 'em up my nose...
What?

Down my throat.

Okay, that's you, man.

Royal sovereign FS44P.

I think we got the king
of coin counters right here.

Look at that hopper!

800 coin capacity,
300 coins per minute.

18,000 an hour.

We're gonna need more of these.

Well that's the goal.

That's the goal.

All right.

Tomorrow we hit up
a fountain together.

Then after that we split
up to cover more ground.

Yeah, got it.

Now, what do you do if
the police come around?

Tell them the truth, but no
more than they need to know.

Routine cleaning.

When you're finished?

Leave five dollars
in pennies and nickels,

to encourage replenishment.

I got this.

You remember that
cold-ass winter?

Like '86, '87?

I do.

This ain't gonna end
up like that, is it?

No.

Not at all.

Do you feel like
a million bucks?

'Cause you look like
a million bucks.

We knew this day would come.

Maybe about a month
before they're replenished?

At least.

High traffic zones might fill
up sooner, but who knows.

What do you think?

Break for a few months
and hope people start

wishing more than ever?

Nah, at this point we
either buckle or we boom.

Boom!

In the morning I'll call around,

check all the
statewide registries.

If there's a fountain to
be farmed, we'll find it.

Midweek, get you a
firm route planned out.

Well you're coming along
with me on this one, right?

No man, you're the collector.

Nah, you gotta come
along on this one, man.

This is your
journey, my friend.

You must venture alone
into the unknown night

with only brother
moon, sister sun,

there can only be two
moccasins upon your path.

Besides, somebody's
gotta stick around,

make sure this ship
doesn't capsize.

We really got something.

We do, don't we?

So if you're gonna be on
the road and I'm stuck here,

I'm thinking maybe we could
use an extra hand around here

to help out at least with
the investment ideas.

No, no.

That's a lot of numbers
for this brain, man.

One.

All right maybe, maybe.

Just one, one guy or gal, okay?

One.

One. That's all
I'm talkin' about.

All right.

I'll set up the
interviews this week.

You know what, actually,
forget about the interviews.

I got a better idea.

That guy? That's
your better idea?

Yeah, I had an intense
experience with this guy, man.

I just, I got a good
feeling about him.

That's a bona fide Scooby
Doo villain over there, man.

Do you not trust me?

This is reckless!

Jack, just trust
me on this one.

I see something in this guy.

It's called Hepatitis-C,
it's yellowing of the eyes...

No, it's not Hepatitis.

-Is it scabies?
-No scabies.

No rabies.

I see genuine goodness
in this guy, okay?

Not but four weeks ago
there was a fine line

between me and him.

He deserves a second
chance, Jack, and,

we're in a position
to give it to him.

Can you just roll
with me on this?

You ready?

Jesus.

Okay, I'll give you
the Scooby Doo villain.

Thank you.

Miles with the fountains.

And the ride.

You remember.

Age has dulled my sense
of humor, young man.

Not my memory.

How did those lottery
tickets treat you?

Got flipped off a lot.

Thanks for the gesture.

Anytime, here, I got...

Nah, never twice.

But you...

Sir?

Fresh out, sorry.

A little something for
the night train fund.

Durwood, do you enjoy this?

I suppose you
mean my situation?

Yeah.

If you wanna see the best
and worst in people,

just ask them to part

with some of their
hard-earned cash.

I believe it's called begging.

Asking.

I didn't get your name.

Jack, Durwood.

Durwood, Jack.

Pardon Jack.

So what brings you
gentlemen out here?

Actually we wanted
to offer you a job.

If you haven't
noticed, I'm retired.

Why's that funny?

Durwood, I can tell
you're an honest man.

I don't think I
would work for anybody

who would hire a stranger.

Aren't all hirees
strangers at first?

Yeah, but I
might be dangerous.

But you're not
dangerous, are you?

No.

All right.

Well, you wouldn't
be working for us.

You'd be working
with us, Durwood.

And what would that line
of work be, if I might ask?

Coins.

Miles with the fountains.

First you must
incorporate. We must.

To be a legitimate
business you have to have

a legitimate business. There's
gonna be a grey zone in state

and federal taxes but I can
take care of that.

I'll need you to get records
from every harvest site

and receipts, I can't
stress it enough.

You gotta keep every receipt.

We'll start with some
high-interest CD accounts

then we'll go long into fiber
optics, scratch-proof glass,

real estate, maybe,
down the road.

I predict we'll
milk 23 cents out of

every penny you bring back.

Well, I mean, that's...

Can we change out this
city map for a state map?

So we can follow
you on your trip.

I'm sorry, is this going
a little fast for you?

'Cause it is for me.

I mean, we hardly know this guy.

I don't know you.

So I guess I have a
few questions like,

I don't know, why you
smell like burritos,

what's up with your hair?

And if you're such a
brilliant businessman,

how'd you become homeless?

I ended up in the position
I find myself in today,

after a series of decisions.

Decisions with
which I am at peace.

But I'm not homeless, young man.

Can I crash here while
we get this thing going?

Okay, brother.

We're going all
the way with this.

That's right, buddy.

All right.

All right, the receipts
and the release forms,

and all the paperwork,
I'll make sure to have it

and you just gotta keep Jack
in line and we'll be all right.

Yeah.

And I'll try to keep
Durwood out of the garbage.

Drive safe.

All right, that wasn't nice.

That wasn't nice to say at all.

I apologize for him.

But he'll come around and
he'll see what we see, okay?

He's smart.

I wouldn't have hired me either.

Well Durwood,
I just trust you.

Life's a lot easier that
way, you know what I mean?

So you just do your thing,
and we'll have ourselves

a legitimate business
on our hands, okay?

You got it, boss.

No, no.

No boss, none of this...

This, you know, this is...

You know what I mean?

No boss, no boss.

I'll talk to you
later, all right?

Here we go!

We're doin' it!

We need some

better furniture.

I'll get right
on that, Durwood.

When?

Hello.

Hello yourself.

Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

I was just leaving.

What'd you wish for?

If I tell you, doesn't
it void the wish?

No, actually.

As soon as your
coin hits the water,

it registers with the
wish distributors.

Besides, you know, when
it comes to wishes,

it's not the coin
that matters anyway.

Are you superstitious?

Yeah, yeah I've knocked
on my fair share of wood.

Then would you mind
leaving mine in there?

Just in case.

Which one is it?

It's that one.

It's that one?

You know what,
actually it's...

Yeah.

Yeah, it's my
lunchtime, actually.

It's a really nice day out.

You seem like equally
a nice person.

Why don't you take a walk
with me around the park

and I'll spare your
coin another day?

Why not.

Why not.

All right.

It must be nice to
work here every day.

Plenty of fresh air...

You get to watch the seasons
change right before you eyes.

Yeah about that?

I I don't mean
to mislead you

but I don't work for the park.

Who do you work for?

Myself.

-Yourself?
-Yeah.

Then what is...

What were you...

What?

Just consider me
one of the world's

most active coin collectors.

-Come on.
-No, I'm serious.

You're pulling my leg.

No.

Seriously?

Seriously, seriously!

So you make a living here?

Yeah, well here,
there, you know.

Everywhere.

That is crazy.

So what were you before this?

Miserable.

And now?

Making progress.

All right what about you?

What are you doing
out here on a,

Tuesday?

-Wednesday.
-Wednesday.

Close.

Well, besides the obvious?

The fresh air.

The sights.

I used to come here
when I was a kid.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

But now I'm just, you
know, passing through.

Travelling the state.

A vacation, sort of.

Okay.

Getting off the
grid for a while.

The grid?

So what about you?

Where do your roots end?

The grid.

Where are you goin'?

Well that's...

That is a good
question, isn't it?

Well wait.

Wait.

If I'm gonna take anything
away from this conversation,

let it be your name.

Penelope.

Miles.

As in, like...

No.

As in Ellie, not Penny.

God, wouldn't that be something.

Yeah, it would.

All right.

Okay.

Well, did you...

Quarter, dime, nickel?

Your wish.

Penny.

Of course.

All right well I'm gonna
be here until about

midnight tonight so I'm gonna
leave all the pennies there

until then and that guarantees
that your wish is heard

and you know, at
the end of the night

I'll have to go in and
swoop 'em all up but,

all will be well.

Okay.

Okay.

Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

I am on vacation.

You never know.

All right.

What'd you wish for?

What we're all wishing for.

What are you doing right now?

Checking the internet.

Making sure you're
not gonna murder me.

What's your last name?

I need you to get
these notarized.

I gotta check out
fountain progress.

Miles, what's up!

Hey, buddy.

One week without
our fearless leader.

Good news on your end?

If things keep going
the way they're going,

we're gonna retire by the
end of next year, brother.

You guys should be receiving
some packages from me

by the end of the week, okay?

And I am currently
one day behind.

All right. Everything okay?

I'm just gonna spend the
night here in zone seven

and then I'll make
everything up tomorrow.

Remember, you're
on CEO time now, buddy

so just pace yourself.

You pace yourself.

Listen, didn't mean
to mention it but I got

some ideas I wanna run by you.

I can't wait to hear 'em!

You wanna just give 'em to
me in detail when I get back?

Sure sure.

Happy treasuring, my friend.

Talk to you soon.

So?

So what?

So, how's he doing?

Well, Miles is
doing well, Durwood.

Thank you for asking, I
appreciate your concern.

Do you have a problem?

Yeah.

Matter of fact.

Just because you know your
way around the legal landscape

doesn't mean we're friends.

Damn sure doesn't
mean I trust you.

Miles does.

Miles isn't right
about everything.

You trust him?

Yes I do.

Then give me a chance.

I'm here to help.

Have some fun in the process.

I don't need to be here.

What, are you gonna
go back to your job

haunting the
abandoned mineshaft?

Maybe.

I have some ideas, on R&D.

Think we can make Miles'
life a little bit easier.

We'd have to hire somebody
though, freelance, of course.

Can you get on board?

We all agreed not
to hire anybody.

But I'll trust you.

We'll break it to Miles later.

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry, are you okay?

Yeah?

-Here.
-Yeah.

You got me good!

You know, I was hoping to run
into you, I just, you know,

not quite...

Like that.

You almost missed me.

I was just packing up.

Really?

Where were you headed?

Just looking to put some asphalt
between me and my problems.

I see.

Well...

They're never quite as bad
as they seem to be?

All right, this may
seem absolutely bonkers

since we're pretty
much strangers...

Well isn't everybody?

Yeah, at first, right?

Why don't you ride with me?

What?

I mean, there's plenty
of fresh air out there.

You know, if you're
looking for change,

you just gotta know
where to find it.

It makes sense.

To coin a phrase.

Hurry fast or I'm about
to turn on a dime.

I'll keep 'em coming.

Quarter.

You do have my coin, right?

I do.

So I guess that
makes me a shareholder.

It does.

I guess I could ride along and

keep tabs on my investment.

Yeah?

Okay!

You better be a
normal dude, though.

I'm just a dude bein'
normal in a light-blue onesie!

Out in public!

All right, where to?

You wanna pick
on the other side.

It's not going through, okay.

Okay, you wanna, okay...

Think
you'd fit in here?

Yep.

I need this job so I
can pay off people.

They won't be coming
here though, I promise.

I trust you.

You know, that fancy phone
has a fancy map on there too.

But, this is a treasure map.

Okay?

You don't do that
on a treasure map.

You gotta lay it out, like this.

Then you trace it.

Okay.

I'm gonna go load up
on some junk food.

All right.

Hello!

Hey, partner.

Keep up the good work, man,
we're rollin' in dough here.

It's gonna get deeper
because we are actually

ahead of schedule now.

Really?

Yeah.

Jack listen.

I I have to
tell you something.

I hired someone.

Who is he?

He is a she and
her name is Penelope.

Penelope? Woohoohoohoo!

I I met her at
zone number seven,

and yeah.

All right I'm not gonna
give you too much hell,

just tell me this,
is she worth it?

Wahoo!

I do believe so.

Okay.

All right then.

You're taking this a
hell of a lot better than I

thought you would.

Do you trust me, Miles?

Of course I trust you.

The feeling is mutual.

I'm sure you had good reasons.

Yeah, I had very good reasons.

But she's the last one.

No más.

Cool cool.

Well, I gotta get back to it.

Got a big surprise waiting
for you when you get back.

Okay, cool.

Well you tell
Durwood I said hello.

All right, sounds good.

That was our fearless leader.

What are you running from?

I'm not running.

I'm just keeping pace.

Okay.

It's a long story.

No actually, it's
not a long story.

I just, I don't want
you to think less of me.

That's impossible, I can
never think less of you.

Someone very close
to me is sick.

She has been for a while.

And I, took a
risk to do something.

I got carried away.

Well, sounds like you
were just trying to do

the right thing.

There's nothing wrong with that.

Right.

Checks and sandwich
time, gentlemen.

Here you go, Lawrence.

All right,
enjoy, fellas.

That was the best
barbecue I've ever had.

Seriously.

What's in the sauce?

Old family secret.

You got a lot of
secrets, Durwood.

How do you know so much?

It's just sauce.

No, about everything.

About barbecue, about
obscure taxation laws.

Life.

I've lived a lot of it.

Yeah.

Worn a lot of hats.

I never would have given
you the time of day unless

Miles had insisted.

He's always had a
certain intuition

that I just don't.

Can't teach intuition, can you?

He's a born leader.

Doesn't even know it.

Don't compare your goodness

by the prism of somebody else.

You're doing all right by him.

What do you want out
of all this, Durwood?

I mean, besides the obvious.

One thing I want, is for a
certain smart young individual

to forgo the assumptions
accompanying a man's clothes.

A mistake I've
made once or twice.

Then, well I might die happy.

Which will probably be the
case when Miles gets back.

He's gonna kill us when he
sees we've hired a full staff.

Doesn't it cost a
lot to send these back?

No it's like
pennies on the dollar.

Besides, when these little
piggies are at guard,

it keeps "the powers that be"
from interfering.

So they're like sentinels.

Yeah.

Exactly.

You know, I used to have
one of these when I was a kid.

I filled it with chewing gum
and baseball cards though.

A pretty girl
with baseball cards.

You are so adorable.

Gosh that seems
so far away now.

Why don't we, you
know, go see your folks?

You said they're
close by, right?

I don't think
that's such a good idea.

No? Okay.

Right.

Cool.

We can't stay long though.

Okay.

Let's do it.

It's okay.

Could you
just give me a second?

Okay, no problem.

Okay.

Okay?

You have a
responsibility that you

haven't taken care of!
No, Dad!

You know why I did it!

You know exactly why I did that!

Right, but now it's
time to take care of it!

Don't
you start with that!

You must be Miles.

Mrs. Norris.

Sorry I just let
myself in like that.

Don't be silly.

I've heard so much
about you from

Penelope's post cards.

You know, she doesn't
get to call home

that much anymore.

Would you mind helping
me in the kitchen?

Yeah, I'd love to.

-Okay.
-Yes, yes.

Mom, are you okay?

I understand you're
a business owner.

How exciting.

He doesn't want
to talk about that.

Well, why don't we just let
Miles be the judge of that?

Yes, ma'am, I am.

I...

What kind of business is it?

That's a good question.

He's a collector.

Professional collector.

And he's been nice
enough to give me a job.

I see.

So, antiques or cars, or...

Coins.

Okay!

That's very neat, Miles.

Yeah.

You've raised a
wonderful daughter.

A business owner and a
good judge of character.

We've really grown up with her.

We miss her.

I'm sure you'll
understand some day,

that is if you have children.

Yeah, yeah obviously.

Yes, yeah.

Yeah, kids.

We've just been talking.

Miles here has been kind
enough to give Penelope a job.

Is that so?

What line of work
are you in, Miles?

He collects coins.

Isn't that fascinating?

And you turn profit, do you?

You'd be surprised, sir.

How old are you, Miles?

I'm...

35.

I'm willing to give
the benefit of the doubt

to anyone who's 35
and still says sir.

Who wants dessert?

Yeah.

First, we gotta talk.

Miles, you seem to be
an impressive young man,

I trust you won't be offended
if I ask you to wait outside.

No, he stays.

He can hear whatever
you have to say.

It's okay, it's
okay, really, I...

No.

Very well.

Will you give this
to Penelope, please?

Okay, all right.

Now that's $500.

And I want you to take it,
regardless of what comes next.

Dad, I told you, I have a job.

I have an income now.

I'm gonna set this all straight.

I'm gonna dial this number.

This is a good man, and he
tells me that he's gonna do

everything in his power
to try to help you out.

Stop it.

She's not a criminal.

We've all made mistakes.

Why are you doing this, Dad?

'Cause you have to face this,

so we can get past this
and become a family again.

Again?

I love you with all my heart,

but that's why I
have to do this.

The law is the law, Penelope.

I can't stop you from
walking out that door,

but please, don't disappoint
me anymore, sweetie.

So, would we like to have
banana pudding or shortcake?

You cannot keep
running from consequence.

If you liked the meatloaf,
Miles, I think you would

like the banana pudding.

We shouldn't have come.

Dad, don't do this!

I gotta go, I gotta go.

I love you.

I love you too.

Great meatloaf.

Thank you, Miles.

Goodbye, Penelope.

Okay.

I'll just wiggle on
out of here.

You okay?

Let's go.

Penelope...

I want you know that
you don't ever have to

feel like you have to
talk about that, okay?

I'm in a lot of
trouble, Miles.

Okay?

What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

The money kind.

Where I might have to
go away for a while.

You'd believe me if I
told you I was just trying

to do the right thing, right?

Because I was.
Absolutely.

I know you were trying
to do the right thing.

I know that.

They mean everything to
me and I can't imagine life

without them and when
my mom got sick, I...

I'm trouble.

I bet I'm a lot
more trouble than you.

I'll be there with you
and we will find a way.

Okay?

All right...

You can start by getting
a good night's rest.

Yeah.

It's gonna be okay.

Ellie! It's me.

It's the fella next door.

Last night was great,
it was special.

Especially...

Especially great!

I don't wanna compromise this...

Us.

I know I'm not exactly Johnny
Poetry Pants out here but

I made you somethin'!

I bet you're tired, you know?

'Cause I know I am.

And that's not me braggin'
or nothin', that's just,

you know, it's, can we talk?

Are
you Penelope Norris?

No...

Then
please step aside.

You step aside.

Let me see some
identification, son.

Can you tell me what you do
for a living, Mr. McCray?

Yeah.

What do you do for a living?

I work.

Nothin'.

All right.

Hey, can I ask
what's going on here?

No, you may not.

You gonna tell me where
Penelope's headed?

I have no idea.

Say that again.

I have no idea.

It's your lucky day.

We believe you.

We're done here, Kyle.

Have a nice day.

Hey,
you can't take those soaps.

Evidence.

Tell me the meaning
of life, Durwood.

Now is as good a time as any.

Well I had it years ago, but,

then I left it on the roof
of my car at a gas station

and drove off.

Something she
said stuck with me.

Said we were thieving wishes.

I don't know about that.

Coins are just the vessels.

Let's just make sure we
put them to good use.

So how are you and
Jack getting along?

He's a good manager.

And a good man.

We got ourselves quite an
empire on our hands here,

Durwood.

Hey!

It's a shooting star!

Two sips.

Cheers.

Cheers.

You will find her.

All right well thanks for
yappin' with me, Durwood.

Next time why don't we talk
about your love life, all right?

It's only fair.

Yeah, I'll tell you about the

12 loves of my life.

Deal.

Take care.

More coffee?

Thanks, Hans.

It will be okay.

Miles.

What's good, Jack?

Everything, man, everything.

How's the road?

Very nurturing, actually.

We have officially
farmed the state dry.

Really?

Then I guess it's time for you
to come back home then?

No, Jack. National.

What?

What do you mean national?

If North Carolina is any
indication of what we can do,

think about the
possibilities here.

Listen.

Miles, I gotta
tell you something.

National sounds great.

It's a good idea.

All right!

I knew you'd be on board, man.

Jack?

Jack.

Yeah, yeah.

I'll make the arrangements.

I miss you, man.

National, buddy.

Yeah.

Time to get to work.

Thanks, man.

Hoods up.

-Hey!
-Hey!

It's good to
see you, welcome back.

Good to see you too.

The lone prospector returns.

It's good to see you, Durwood.

Is that a little
grey I see in there?

Older and wiser from the road.

I guess he's all "growed up".

Why don't we have
those beers?

We got something
to show you first.

Told you we had a
surprise for you, right?

You did say that.

Okay.

Fearless leader!

This is where it all begins.

Donald, Lawrence and Tim,

some of the finest
in the coin business.

Error coins and
rarities are their game.

This is Durwood's
brilliant idea.

A clipped planchet
Eisenhower can go for $400.

A raised-rim Indian cent
can maybe fetch $100.

A double-struck quarter
can go for $1000.

Then there are the rarities.

That would be Hans.

Who is Hans?

Hello Supreme Leader!

Please don't do that,
don't do that ever again.

I am sorry, Supreme Leader.

I am sorry.
It's okay.

Hans here is in possession
of some very very rare coins.

Have you ever heard of a
1913 Liberty Head nickel?

Nope, never heard of one.

Well, you found one.

And now Hans has it.

Priceless.

What's to prevent Hans here
from just running off with it?

Never!

Supreme Leader has
given me everything.

Everything!

That, that is dedication.

Find me that 1849
double eagle, gentlemen.

-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

All unremarkable
coins end up here,

where 55% of our profit is born.

I know, it ain't
much to see but,

it is beautiful hearing all
those dollars rake in, right?

Now, you're gonna wanna
wear one of these.

Fearless leader.

We melt the coins
down to their very essence.

Pre-1963 dimes and
quarters for pure silver,

World War II nickels
for copper and silver.

So I guess this is
where currency comes to die.

No, to
be reborn, Miles.

And at three to 6,000%
increase in value.

I'm pretty
sure it's illegal, Jack.

No, it's not illegal.

We Googled it, we Binged
it, we asked Jeeves.

Who will return to
retrieve their coin?

Do you think they care
what happens to them?

Who do you think
we're hurting here?

It's not illegal.

It's capitalism.

Here's to Miles with
the fountains, home again.

Okay, guys.

How did this all happen?

This is a caricature.

A caricature of what?

You said you wanted something
unique, something of our own.

I said hire nobody else.

We agreed to hire nobody else
and you went out and hired

a freaking army, man.

-We hired a few guys.
-A few?

To be fair, you hired
what's her name, Penelope?

Okay, I needed Penelope out
there to help me just as much

as you needed Durwood here
and you were fine with it.

Durwood, did you
agree to all this?

No.

I didn't agree to it.

It was my idea.

If you're gonna blame
somebody, blame me.

I see.

Yeah, great.

What's up with the
two gold watches?

Is that really necessary?

One's west coast time.

Tim, go get a glass.

What kind of glass?

A glass.

A glass!

Sheesh!

I can't lose this job, guys.

No one can.

Here's the glass,
here's the glass.

Thank you, finally!

What is the real problem
here, are you mad at my watches,

or is it that this all
happened in your absence?

That without you, we took
a legitimate opportunity

and actualized it to
its infinite potential,

those are you words, Miles!
Yeah yeah!

Infinite potential,
yes, but we have it

without all of this, okay?

This is a freaking bureaucracy
that we were trying to avoid.

This is all the corporate
stuff that we didn't want...

What's
not to like here?

You're turning it
into something else!

Now it is a weight
on our shoulders!

It's weight, yeah, it's
weight in our pockets, man.

I send you the
package, you smash them

and you put 'em
in the bank, okay?

You think that you are on
the cusp of being a millionaire

because of you and your
broom and Penelope,

we took your idea and we
grew it, we made it bigger,

we made it better, it's
working, it's a success!

We were trying to
get out of the cubicle,

you're taking me right back!

We made something good, you
wanna knock it down, go ahead,

fire them, I'm not gonna do it!

What goes, guys?

Not now, Hans!

Our fate hangs by a string.

Shoot.

Fearless leader!

Fearless leader!

A
Glass for your beer?

My god.

It's so good to see you.

Hi.

Hey.

God, I really missed you.

Hey after you left
I ran into those guys

that were looking for you,
I didn't say anything.

I

I made these for you.

It's okay, they're just...

They're perfect.

Will you put them on me?

Yeah, yeah.

Let's see.

You look gorgeous.

I brought you your sweater.

I don't care about my sweater,
it's...

I turned myself in.

Is that passion fruit?

It's like a mixed mango.

I found the note you
left in the fountain.

I love you too.

Good.

I want to make this work.

I'll wait, okay?

I have to go.

Just...

She's beautiful, Miles.

That's what was so worth
it, that was your hire?

All right.

Call 'em up, Jack.

You call 'em up, Miles.

So you wanted to see me?

Yeah, I know we really
haven't had a chance to get to

know each other
much, you know, but,

you seem like a stand-up guy.

Makes it all the
harder to do this,

I'm gonna have to

let you...

Yeah, just let me flourish.

I understand.

I gotta let you go.

Go where?

Go get you some coffee?

Okay, you're...

Why?

It's just, things have
gotten a little out of hand.

We started in crazy. Why
is crazy affecting us now?

My wife, she's about
to have a little baby.

I'm supposed to check out
the sonogram this week.

And I have student
loans coming to my ears.

You know, to get down here I
bought a $125,000 Winnebago.

Right here, next months'
projected earnings.

Sorry, I'm sorry.

Don't tell me
it's Tim, is it Tim?

What did Tim say?
What did he say?

Fire those sketchy guys, you
know who I'm talking about.

I'd like to extend an
invitation to our annual...

Bake-off?

An exit strategy, or I'm
gonna burn the place down.

That's it.

That's it.

You know what?
This is bullsh...

Thank you.

Thank you.

It's done.

You got your way.

I'm done too, okay?

Consider me fired as well.

Listen, Miles,
this is your baby.

Reset it, you can
rehire those guys.

Do what you gotta do.

Let me get this straight.

You just fired
everybody, now you

dump it in our laps
and you're gonna bail?

Jack, I'm not cut
out for this, okay?

You go out that door,
you know what it means.

Then we're done.

We're done done.

Then we're done done.

Jack, relax.

You relax.

Just calm down.

I see.

You're just gonna take
your ball and go home.

Good luck.

Way to go, Durwood.

Me?

Everything's fallen apart
and it's because of you.

Look, you can fix
this, this is fixable.

This all started the
minute we brought you on.

I told him not to
hire you and he did.

Swallow your pride, son.

You're fired.

You can't fire me.

I just did.

You're fired.

You're fired.

You're fired!

I'm gonna go after my
friend and when we get back,

you should not be here.

We'll be in touch if a position
becomes open down the line.

Look, now is not the
time to talk to Miles.

Calm down, let him calm
down, give it some time.

Goodbye, Durwood.

Not now, Hans.

It's okay.

How'd you find me, man?

You like to gamble.

Once in a blue moon I
like to gamble with you.

Listen I...

That got pretty...

Yeah, I know.

I was ready, man,
I was on board.

What did you want
out of all that?

Jack, if you asked me
that when we first started,

you know, I would
have said success but,

all I want is Penelope,

and my best friend back.

And I'm sorry
because it really...

I'm sorry.

What's next?

Durwood!

Durwood!

Durwood? Come on, man!

Hey look, I'm sorry about
the way we handled that, man.

We were out of line and,

it's just plain
wrong, all right?

Where you at?

His stuff's still back there.

And I got like 10 voicemails.

Are you here to see Durwood?

Are you two on the list?

We can be.

What are your names?

-Miles.
-Jack.

He's asked to see
the two of you last.

Okay.

Thanks.

He's ready for you.

Miles with the fountains.

What happened?

The inevitable.

I I got you something.

You know, sometimes I

wonder what kind of
old man I'll make,

and I sure as hell hope I'm
as cool as you, Durwood.

I really do.

Strange thing to think.

I wanna tell you something.

What do you need?

You gave me this.

Yeah.

This is good.

This.

Better.

You all right?

Durwood, are you okay?

This doesn't feel real.

That's the way it is.

What'd you say?

What's that?

That's the way it is.

It's the way it is.

Well we'll see
you tomorrow, right?

Tomorrow.

Good. Yeah.

Good morning, gentlemen.

Morning.

I'm Jack.

Eli.

-Miles.
-Miles.

Pleasure to meet you, sir.

Nice to meet you too.

Before we start, we just
wanted to make it clear that

we intend on
covering everything.

Spare no expenses,
he was the best.

Well I appreciate the
gesture, it's very noble

but it's all taken care of.

I don't understand.

I'll leave that to
somebody better equipped.

Come on in!

Hi, gentlemen.

Surely this will be
a lot to take in,

but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

I'm Durwood's daughter.

Thank you.

You must be Miles.

Yes.

And you're Jack.

Yeah.

Good to meet you.

I've heard a lot
about you both.

My father was many things.

Most notably a man of

celebration.

But he wasn't exactly
the man that you

thought he was.

What I'm trying to say is,

my father was a
self-made billionaire.

He had many enterprises.

In a younger life he
was a war veteran,

a surgeon, and always
a man of his word.

But, Bone Doctor's Sauce

was his life's passion.

Old family secret.

His diagnosis gave
him very little time,

so he dedicated himself
to one final act.

He returned to a station
in life he once knew,

under the guise
of utter poverty.

He wanted to prove the good
in people on his own terms.

Apparently,

you two,

balanced the scales.

I can see why it
was worth it to him.

Gentlemen,

Mr. Hamilton's last will
and testament grants you

limited power of his estate

to decide which charities will
receive 90% of his wealth,

and the rest will be allocated
amongst his 12 grandchildren.

And along with requesting your
compliance as pallbearers,

he's asked me to
read you these words.

"Start again."

The world
is still here.

But a shade less
bright without you.

I think you'll find your troubles
have a way of growing up

and leaving home.

Not through the door,
not out the window,

but gone none the less.

May your family have bread so
that they never know hunger,

and salt so life
always has flavor.

We will
always deal in coin

with the understanding
that its purpose springs

only from the hand beneath it.

For now,

we just live.

They say youth
is wasted on the young,

but in three months, you
and I will prove otherwise.

Sending you well wishes.
