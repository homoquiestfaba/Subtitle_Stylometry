<i>The tomatoes go in the refrigerator
and the bananas go in the fruit bowl.</i>

<i>I do some of the grocery shopping,
and always do the tomatoes first.</i>

<i>We don't ask for information.</i>

<i>You say that's it?
That's the only problem.</i>

<i>People will do that, the tomato crop,
tomato prices will be part of the deal.</i>

<i>Well, I thought that they'll have
a much better product, yeah.</i>

<i>But this lot will grow in the back yard,
pick 'em whenever you want.</i>

<i>If you want to eat tomatoes
12 months out of the year,</i>

<i>you're gonna have to pick 'em
at one of these two stations.</i>

What the hell's wrong with you?

Airport.

<i>Wake Me</i>

<i>Hold me, hold me near you</i>

<i>It's your choice, oh, Lord</i>

<i>- Hello. You've reached...
John McCleary.</i>

<i>After the tone,
please leave a message.</i>

It's done.

Just go inside.

What?
Go inside. Just go, just go.

<i>$300? You parasite!</i>

Mom, I'm back.

<i>50, 60, 70,</i>

<i>75.</i>

<i>I'm not wealthy.
I'm just a woman with $75.</i>

Hey.

Excited to see me, huh?

You actually got me.

I got you.
Yeah, pretty good.

Got you, got you!

What is this shit you're watching?

Oh...

Psycho was on today.

Yeah.
Yeah.

That scared me.
Oh, boy, it scared me.

Then why are you watching it alone?

I don't know.
I should've waited for you.

Ohh...

Joe?
Yeah?

Would you just stay a little bit?

Just stay.

Okay.
Just...

Cos you watched some scary,
fucking movie?

Just till I've finished the movie.

Joe?

Uh?

Mom?

Yeah?

I can't turn the tap off!

Oh, I don't have any of the...

I can't find anything.

What are you looking for?
I can't find my toothbrush.

It's right behind the mirror.

Wait...

Oh, oh, okay.

Mom? Come on!

Let's go. I'm opening.
No, no, no, no! Stop that!

Just let me...
I'm opening the door.

No, no, no!

What are you doing?
What are you fucking around with?

There's water everywhere!
I'm not fucking around!

You are! There's nothing.
You keep rearranging... Get out.

I need my space!

Your what?
My space.

Alright. Go get your space downstairs.

Okay, I just needed that...

Are you sure
you can get downstairs alright?

What? Yeah.

Yeah, if I do it really slow.

I know what to do.

The man called.

Said he wants to see you, right away.

Did your son tell you that he saw me?

Hey, he was...
with a friend, you know.

It's just... just a coincidence, man.

Did he tell you where he saw me?

No.

No, I...
I know you wouldn't want me to know, man.

Moises didn't mean to see you, Joe. He...

Don't yell at me.

He's just a stupid freaking kid.

I know, but...
He...

We're done, Angel.

Joe, he didn't mean to see you.

Come on.

Take the money.

<i>J...</i>

<i>We're like Jack and Jill</i>

<i>K, you're so kissable</i>

<i>L</i>

<i>Is the love light in your eyes</i>

<i>M, N, O, P</i>

<i>I could go on all day</i>

Yes, you could.

<i>W, X, Y, Z</i>

Mom...
What?

This fridge is disgusting.

What's wrong?
You got...

And all this shit's rotten.

Well, honey,
what are you looking for?

This cream cheese is from 1972.

I use it. Just leave it.

How's Janice?
Who's Janice?

Oh, come on.
You know who Janice is.

You mean my girlfriend from 20 years ago?

She would've been a good mom.

<i>Stop it!</i>

Joe?

Coming!

Going up?

What's all this?

That Cincinnati kid.

Parents are florists.

A warm thank you for getting
their darling daughter back home safe.

Flowers.

Josephine loved flowers.

I could never see the point myself.

The fuckers die anyway
and stink up the whole damn place.

God bless her.

Hey, um...

Listen, we gotta lose Angel's number.

I'll find a new service.
Okay.

No problem.

So, Angel's out.

You could uh... just call me directly,
you know, like a normal person.

There's no green ones.

I like green.
Hm.

Fucking asshole!

Why am I here?

State Senator Albert Votto.

I ran his father's security
back in the '80s.

Lost track of him after his arraignment.

I found a green one.

The wife - Votto Junior's wife -

kills herself a couple of years ago.

Their teenage daughter's
been running away from home ever since.

I'm listening.

Votto calls me this morning.

She's been missing all weekend.

He doesn't wanna get the cops involved

now that he's running
on Governor Williams's ticket.

Ahh!

He's paying 50 grand cash.

What's the lead?

He got an anonymous text with an address.

Meet him at the Union Club, 2pm.

Josephine II is coming out of dry dock,
thanks to this.

I'm gonna drive her through the harbor
with a big fucking fireworks display.

You, me, couple of steaks,
cold beers, setting sun...

What do you say to that?

What?

<i>235 East 31st Street.</i>

<i>That's what the text said.</i>

You have kids, Joe?

No.

Nina.

Her name is Nina.

I've heard of these places...

Underage girls.

Senator, if she's there,

I'll get her.

McCleary said you were brutal.

I can be.

Gonna need this.

Be at this address, 3am.

Hotel Caribe, room 701.

I want you to hurt them.

Keys.
Have a nice day.

What are you doing?

Would you mind taking a picture for us?

What?

Would you mind taking
a picture of us?

Thank you so much.

What the fuck are we doing?

Go, go!

He doesn't know...

He has no idea.

I've been waiting for
you for 20 minutes.

Relax, man, relax.
Chill the fuck up.

Don't make me late!

<i>Run! Run!</i>

Shut the fuck up.

<i>A) You're adorable</i>

<i>B) You're so beautiful</i>

Argh!

Argh!

Shh, shh, shh. Relax.

What's your name?

Scott.

I'm Mr. Rogers.
Listen, I'm gonna ask you some questions.

Please be honest with me.

Right, security - how many are there?

Huh? Is there one? More than one?

Two, three? Come on, talk.
Two.

Two? Where?

Where in the house are they?

One guy inside the front door.

The second guy on the top floor.

Where's the playground?

Playground?

The underage girls?
Third floor.

I just...

I just work here. I just run errands.
I don't...

They're freaks, man.

It's okay.

Do you carry keys? No?

What's the code of the front door?

439.
What is it?

Promise you won't kill me.

What's the fucking code?

4392.

Good boy.

Please.
