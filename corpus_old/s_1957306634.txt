What the fuck, man?

(thud, grunt)



â™ª

(music ends)

We have to go to the police.

Virginia: Wrong.
That's not a good idea.

No one's talking to you.

I'm just sayin' that
doesn't help anyone out.

You're going to jail
for the rest of your life.

Honey...
Get it together, man.

You fuckin' that tripped out?

You been livin' in this
big-ass crib for too long,

don't understand shit.

Look, give us
some fuckin' money

and we'll be
out of your life forever.

You're not
getting out of this.

-You killed Derrick.
-What the fuck?

You should be dead,
not him!

That sick
little bitch over there

attacked me, yo.

And then he fell the fuck out.

I don't know what the fuck
happened to him.

Because you broke
into our house!

(high-pitched):
Bitch...

How the fuck you gonna
fall the fuck out

-over someone sprayin' you--
-Shut up!

Who the fuck
is you talkin' to?

Damn, give us money.
We'll get outta your life.

We'll take your friend
with us.

We'll make it look like
an accident, alright?

I can't do that to him.

Oh, okay, big man.
So what you gonna do?

You got a big plan?

What you gonna do?

Because if you had come out
ya pockets from jump,

you could have
avoided all this.

("Habanera" resumes)

â™ª

Oh, yeah.
Take a look at my video again.

Maybe it's different.

(train clattering)


What the fuck, man?

(thud, grunting)

Virginia:
Didn't think no one
saw you, did ya?

(shouts, thud)

Wale:
You okay?

(train clattering)

(train screeching)

Virginia:
<i>We followed your dumb ass</i>
<i>right to your door.</i>

The shit ain't change.

It's you killin' a cop.

You done.

(fighting resumes on phone)

That was self-defense.

That was a white cop.

You don't get that?

(shouts, thud)

(shouting replays on video)

(turns phone off)

-Wale: We have to go
to the police.
-No.

You'll go to jail.

Think.

How about $5,000?

Ask him.

(sucks teeth)

(chuckling deeply)

So wassup, killer?


Does that work for you?

Gonzo:
I tell you what...

You give me $50,000,

and we'll be gone.

We just don't have
that kind of money.

Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

-Y'all pay at least
$8,000 a month.
-That's how they do.

That's how these
rich motherfuckers do.

Y'all got
that kinda money.

Maybe there's something else
that we can think of.

Gonzo:
Ain't nothin' else
to think about.

You gonna pay
for that video, eh?

You gonna pay for that
shit you did to my face.

You broke into our home.

Gonzo:
I ain't even gonna
argue with you.

Just give me the money,

we'll be gone
and no one will know

that your bitch-ass
killed that cop.

Just give me
a reasonable number.

-Gonzo: Or what?
-Virginia: Twenty-five to life.

That's a reasonable fuckin'
number to think about.

How 'bout that one?

Wale:
For Derrick?

Yo, you gonna try
to get swole?

What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill us?

(Gonzo laughing)

I dare you!

Yo, chill.
Yo, us?

Speak for your fuckin' self
on that one.

-Go ahead, kill<i> that</i> nigga.</i>
-Virge, shut the fuck up.

-I'm handling this.
-No, you shut the fuck up.

Don't tell me
to shut the fuck up.

Yo, I tell whoever I want
to shut the fuck up.

Yo, check who the fuck
you talkin' to!

-Shut the fuck up!
-Who the fuck you talkin' to?

-Shut the fuck up!
-You shut the fuck up!

-Shut the fuck up!
-Both of you shut the fuck up!

Shut up!

Shut the fuck up.

Shut the fuck up.

We don't have $50,000
to give you but...

we, we can do eight.

Right?

See!

(footsteps receding)

Take the eight,
this all goes away.

Just, just...

just tell me who
to make the check out to.

I gotchu.

It's spelled...

-(pen clicks)
-G...

O...

F...

U...

C... (laughing)

-K. Go...
-You think this is all
a fucking joke?

Gonzo:
Fuck yourself today!

You was writing that shit,
you dumb motherfucker.

You a joke.

Virginia:
He was writin' that shit, yo.

-Yo, keep writin' that shit.
-Your offer's a fuckin' joke!

And then put it
on the fuckin' mirror!

Dumb. Dumb.

Gonzo:
Fuck your whole shit up,
fuckin' $8,000.

Get the fuck outta here!

Don't play with me
like that!

(Claudia sighs)

Maybe we can just find a way
to give them the $50,000.

If you think I'm about
to give these fuckin' idiots

everything that we
have worked for,

you are out
of your fuckin' mind.

Then we gotta go
to the fuckin' cops.

-Now.
-You want to spend the rest
of your life in prison?

That's what you want to do?

Virginia:
Never seen a Black man

-wanna run
to the po-po so bad.
-Bitch.

-He's a little bitch.
-You ever seen
no shit like that?

What other option
do we have?

All they got
is that video.

Without that video,
they got nothing.

("Habanera" resumes)

What you thinkin', Virge?

Look at my shit.

Proof that they
broke in here,

that they killed Derrick.

Who's to say they
didn't kill that cop?

-They could've
killed the cop.
-It won't work.

-Why not?
-We don't know how many
videos they made.

Oh, you really seriously think
they had time to back it up?

You think they
did that shit, seriously?

Think!

All I know is
if we pay them,

we'll never
get rid of them.

â™ª

They'll follow us
for the rest of our lives.

-A payment is our best option.
-They'll be following us
for the rest of our lives!

This is fuckin' bullshit.

You don't even want to try.

I'm asking you
to do one thing--

I am trying, but you're
not making sense!

I'm making perfect sense!
Are you listening?

-Think about it!
-I'm thinking,
are you fucking thinking?

-Why are you being
so fucking selfish?
-You're the one who wanted--

Who put the fuckin'
down payment on the house?

-Who's paying for IVF?
-What the fuck does that
have to do with this?

Who's paying for your
fucking mother's surgery?

But I'm selfish?

I'm paying for everything
all by my fuckin' self!

Oh, shit.
She went in.

(both laughing)

-That bitch went hard.
-No bitch calling me that shit.

'Cause I get money.
I get money all day.

Broke-ass loser!


Get these fuckin' people
out of my house!

Fine, we're fucking done.

(laughing, chatting quietly)

Hurry the fuck up.

-Wale: We're calling the cops.
-Claudia: No!

We're calling the cops!

-Claudia: No!
-Virginia: Damn.

Stop it!

No!

Wale: Fuck!

Ooh, I love
two chicks fightin'.

-Y'all need a time out!
-(Gonzo laughing)

Broke-ass loser.

Shut your fucking mouth.

-(tape tears)
-Gonzo: Yeah!

-Wale: Ahh!
-Gonzo: Yeah!

-(thud, groans)
-Fuck him up!

-Fuck his whole shit up!
-(thud)

Gonzo:
Fuck yeah!

-(Gonzo laughing)
-No!

(grunts, punches)


How's it feel?

(laughing loudly)

(punches, grunts)

Yo, Vee, stop fuckin' around.
Get me out this shit.

-C'mon! Let's go!
-Alright.

Why the fuck did you lie
to me, motherfucker?

You gonna pay now,
motherfucker!

(laughing mockingly)

Round two, motherfucker.

-I told you.
-(Wale groaning)

You try to sucker punch me,

you try to sucker choke me?

-Virginia: Almost there, yeah?
-I can't wait to beat your--

-Yo, he's moving though.
-Virginia: Alright.

-Hold on, hold on.
-Yo, hurry the fuck up!

-Round two! Yo, he's moving.
-(Wale groaning)

-He's moving.
-Alright, alright, alright.

-Vee, he's fucking movin'.
-Alright.

Hurry the fuck up.
Let's go!

(panting in pain)

(screams, groans)

(moans in pain)

Ahhh!


(groaning, panting)

(breathing heavily)

(shuddering breaths)

(Claudia moaning in pain)

Claudia:
Argh!

(coughs violently)


No, no.
No, wait, wait, wait.

Hold up.
Hold up, hold up.

Hold up, you ain't
gotta do that.

I know what
you gotta do, okay?

Just, tell them...

Just...

Just tell them...

Just, you guys gotta
tell the cops that, ah,

that he robbed you, okay?

And, um...

Y'all came in...

came in during the--
during it,

and shit popped off.

Shit popped off, okay?

And, and he killed
your friend.

(agitated breathing):
And, um...

And then, uh, you two were able
to get the gun.

That's it.
That's what
y'all gonna do.

You're gonna whole thing...

The whole thing
you're gonna blame,

you're gonna blame
on my friend.

And what happens to you?

You'll never see me again.

No.

Mm...
Please, please!

Please! Please! Please!

Look, look, look, look.

I-I got a daughter.

Alright, I'ma show you.

I'll show you, alright?

(agitated breathing)

-Look.
-I don't care!

She don't have anyone

if she doesn't
have me, alright?

She won't have anybody!

(crying hysterically)
I have to get to her!

That's all I want.

Just to get
the fuck out of here.

I just want to get
the fuck outta here!

That's it.

That's it.
That's all it is.

Seriously, fuck that.

I just don't
want to leave her.

(crying hysterically)

You're gonna be alright.

You're gonna be alright.

You're gonna get to be
with your husband,

and everything's
gonna be fine.

It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

Yo, just let me go.

You can keep the phone.

Look, I'm gonna
take this shit off.

It says "no more backup."


Alright?

I'll put it here.

(phone clattering)

(exhales sharply)
Okay.

(inhales, exhales sharply)

I'ma say it.

I'm gonna say it,
you don't have to do that.

-You don't have to do that.
-(Claudia crying)

Look...

Just don't...

Just, just...

Don't do that!

Don't do something
like that!

Just...

Go.

(sighs deeply)

(door closes)

<i>â™ª I found a woman â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She took my love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª God sent down a woman â™ª</i>
