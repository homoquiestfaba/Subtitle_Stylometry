<i>[Episode 15]</i>

I'm not much of a hunter.

But, he was hanging out in front of
my house so blatantly.

I caught him and brought him here.

Oh, I didn't kill him.

Instead, I did give him a small amount
of tranquilizer.

No wait... it wasn't a small amount.
It was a lot.

He'll wake up much later.

Why did you bring him to me?

He's one of infected that have been
after the both of us.

Now that I've caught him,
of course I should share.

Is that the only reason?

Of course,
I have a more important reason why.

Kill him for me... Director.

Whether it's a human or an infected,
I've never killed before.

From what I saw of you last time,
you seem very comfortable with it.

I'm not all that comfortable with it.

Why don't you take this
opportunity to do it yourself?

Isn't it something you
ought try once anyhow?

I'll do when the time comes.

But this time,
I'd like to request that you do it.

And once it's done,
please send me a picture.

It's not that I don't trust you,
Director.

I'd like to see how he looks
when he's dead.

He wouldn't show up somewhere
alive or anything, right?

I should get going now.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience
I've caused.

Do you really the Director will
get rid of that infected man?

That's what I'm saying.

It will be a while before
the tranquilizer wears off.

Whether he kills him or not,
that's not what's important.

If he kills him,
he's killing a long-time follower.

If he doesn't kill him,
he's revealing his true self to me.

That's quite the dilemma.

That's true.

That could be more frustrating
for the Director.

Then, we'll just sit back and
wait for the picture proof.

Most likely, he won't kill him.

Why do you think that?

It would hurt his pride.

To go along with my prank
like that.

Then, we can sleep without
a worry tonight.

Kill him.

But, Doctor...
Kill him.

Thank you for all the years, Doctor.

J is like a brother to me.

So?

I will kill Park Ji Sang instead.

Then everything will be...

We've been together for 40 years.

It is enough that Do Sung and Hyuk Joong
sacrificed their lives.

Tell me why!

Tell me why you have become
my weakness!

I apologize.

I didn't save you from death,
so that you could be insulted like this.

If we fail from a small mistake...

all of our time together...

it becomes nothing,
but time we spent preparing for failure.

All that will be left is... nothing.

Why aren't you sleeping?

Since you're body temperature is
normal, aren't you cold these days?

I can endure it.

It's not so bad.

Do you want to sleep in the room?

What about you?

I'll sleep on bed.
Chief, you can sleep on the floor.

There's lots of room the floor.

Forget it. There should be a distinction
between women and men.

Goodness.

Have you been living since the
end of the Joseon era?

I feel like I'm being an annoyance.

Should I just go back to my place?

What are you talking about?

Forget about it.
You startled me.

Why are you getting so upset?

Don't leave until I've decided that
it's safe.

Okay. I won't leave until you
finish making your decision.

Go to sleep.

Can't you stay a little longer?

I'm having trouble sleeping tonight.

Should I sing you a lullaby or something?

I don't need anything like that.

Just... stay next to me.

You don't even have to say anything.

Come in.

It's a nice morning, isn't it?

Yes, it is.

By the way,
you didn't send me that picture.

I waited all night.

I didn't think it was necessary
to show you.

Why's that?

There's no need to publicize a
harsh image like that.

Because it's too harsh?

Thank you for keeping my feelings
in mind.

Well, we'll just say that I saw it then.

Since, I trust you, Director.

Oh right, I have something
I need to do today.

There might be a small commotion.
Please understand.

Is that true?
Yes.

But, how are you going
deal with the aftermath?

The aftermath? I was depending on you
to take care of it.

Me?
Yes.

Why? Can't you take care of it?
Well, it's not that.

Do it! Just go for it.
I'll take responsibility.

Prepare the apparatus I need to
withdraw blood, please.

I'll be drawing for maybe four or
five patients.

Chief...

Do you, perhaps, have approval?
No.

It's just me, on my own.

We'll take care it,
so don't worry about it, Nurse.

If another commotion arises like
last time...

I can't promise that it won't,
but I'll end it as soon as possible.

As soon as possible.

This has nothing to do with you.

You can't get mixed up in this
like last time, so step outside.

Go on.

I'll be fine.

Restrain them, like you did last time.

Don't let them get away.

If you keep doing this,
it can get problematic.

Then, let it be a problem.

I'm asking you, politely.

Please hand over the blood sample.

Please move out of the way. We're busy.

We can't move.

Move before I finish my counting.

If you don't, you'll spend the day
looking at the ceiling of the clinic.

I'll make sure you can't get up.

You all should have taken my word for it.

Nurse, please call some people
from the clinic.

That looked really painful.

Which way are they heading?

Head over there right now.

How could something like this...

Chief!
Yes, yes.

Yes...

These are the exam results for
the multiple myeloma patient.

Did you check the patient's
immunoglobulin, as well?

Yes.

So, what were you up to?

Uh... nothing. Nothing.

You're acting strange lately.
It seems like you're hiding something.

Hide? What would I hide?

What secrets would I have from you,
Doctor Choi?

Of course you do!

Last year, when you had a prostate
infection, for two weeks you...

Hey, hey... why would you bring that up?

Anyways if you have another secret,
I'll be very upset.

For real.
Okay.

What's going on?

Chief! These are blood samples
from ward 21A.

Gosh, seriously those punks.

What are we? Criminals?

I've set aside half of the blood
you withdrew in another place.

Please pass it along to Joo Hyun Woo.

I will. Thank you.

But, will you be okay?

You've made a mess out of ward 21A.

This would never have been solved
by being a gentlemen.

We should have done this to begin with.

If it weren't for my uncle back then...

That's true.

And I wouldn't have been
embarrassed that wench Suh Hye Ri.

I'm sure you know this,
but please handle this with care.

Yes. I'll take special care and
handle it well.

You need pay special attention and
handle it with care too. Okay?

Wait now, it seems like you all know
something.

I feel like I'm slightly out of the loop.

There is something, isn't there...
something only I don't know!

Wow... I have never seen you
enter without knocking, Director.

Please return the blood samples
that you took.

Oh dear. What should we do, Director?

It's already being processed
in the machine.

It is not something you people
should handle so...

It's not something we should handle
so carelessly?

Why don't we talk... Chief Park Ji Sang?

I didn't realize you'd behave so
brashly and thoughtlessly, Chief.

Using your skills as a infected on
human beings is not right.

Actually, I am quite the fighter.

It wasn't necessary for me to use
my skills as an infected.

It seems like you've become
free of burdens, lately.

I had thought you were a very
troubled person.

At that time, I had something to fear.

So, I felt anxiety about it.

But now,
I have no reason for any of that.

Why did you do something like this today?

You're utilizing our virus for
this research.

So, I became very curious about it.

If this becomes public to the world,
do you realize what would happen?

That won't happen.
It will stay within that group only.

I have nothing to gain from telling
everyone about this either.

It will be for our eyes only.

What would change if you all saw it?

We would get to figure out why
this research is falling apart.

You are always quite pessimistic.

It's not that I'm pessimistic,
I'm just being honest.

On top of that, I suppose we'll find out
just how talented you are, Director.

If you're not up for it,
should we just stop now?

No, why don't you give it a go?

I'd like to hear a more objective
assessment of my talents.

Thank you.

<i>[Death Certificate]</i>

<i>[Employee Information Card]</i>

<i>Suh Hye Ri's place of residence is clean.</i>

<i>And her car is still parked in her
parking lot.</i>

<i>By looking at her closet and make up,
it's clear that she packed luggage.</i>

<i>However, I can't seem to locate her.</i>

<i>Her cell phone has been shut down,
as well.</i>

Stop the investigation for now.
I have something else in mind.

<i>If you truly mean that and
you are sincere...</i>

I hope you and I are alike.

<i>I hope you will not be swayed or
influenced by what's around you.</i>

<i>And stay true to your convictions.</i>

Those convictions should be displayed
by your loyal actions.

Sis.

Hey, Soo Yun.

I have a favor to ask you.

What kind of favor?

You're seriously not leaving?

You can't see the results.

The results are from the tests I ordered.

It's not allowed. Never.

What is this?
Any Joe Schmoe has a say now?

Do not move.

Get the results.

I said... do not move.

What...

Get out.

I can't leave.

Whether we give it to you or not,
you won't be able to leave with it.

Yes, Director.

Yes, sir.

Shouldn't you show them to your seniors first? You're reading them first?

Hey!

It's really true they exist, right?
Right?

You should know since you saw
the test results.

Then if you get infected with VBT-01...

you become a vampire, right?

I guess?

What you tested today was made into
vaccines, so it probably won't work.

In any case, you really need to
keep this a secret.

This is a huge deal, for real.

Okay, I get it. But if...

this virus does exist in real life...

Maybe Chief Park Ji Sang is
infected, as well?

I keep having these suspicions.

No way! You're going overboard again.

I'm going to find out. For sure.

Hey, why do you need to find out
about that? Why?

Why are you getting angry?

I mean you two are acting
beyond suspicious.

Now that you guys live together...

Hm, is it nice? Hm?

We're not living together.
Careful what you say!

Well, you guys are living together.
What else would you call it?

I think something happened?
The hospital's been noisy.

I think so...

You shouldn't worry about it.

Honey, the drugs must be quite potent.

It gives me quite a bit of mood swings.

I'm sorry.
It's okay. I understand.

Your progress alone makes
things okay for me.

Thank you.

Rest while they are waiting
on the test results.

Dad.

Yes, Soo Yun?

I wrote a letter for you.
To encourage you.

You did?

I didn't have any nice letter paper and
envelope, so I just wrote it here.

She gave me the paper.

Here you go, Dad.

Wait! You can't read it out aloud.

Oh!

Sorry Dad!

Honey!

Dad...

Are you okay Soo Yun?

Soo Yun...

Soo Yun...

Soo Yun?

Choi Woo Shik got the third round of
vaccine, right?

Yes.

Tell me the truth.

About what?

It's not the same vaccine that
I know about, right?

I said to tell me the truth.

I don't think I need to report to you?

Just because Director values you, it
doesn't mean I should do the same.

Please refrain from touching me
from now on.

As you can see, these are the results.

I mean, what were they thinking?

Oh, yeah.

There's a patient named
Lee Na Jung, right?

Yes, a child.

She doesn't have anything. She's clean.

I guess they left her alone since she's
still a kid. Thankfully.

According to the analysis, it looks like
the vaccine is embedded in the serum.

Is combining like that possible?
I mean medically.

VBT-01 makes it possible.

What is it?

I want to know more about the vaccine
used for the third round.

Why all of a sudden?

It seems to be different than
what I know.

That's right.

It's much improved than the version
you know.

Can you tell me more in detail?

Simply, it's a hybrid of immune serum
and vaccine.

The immune serum increases the immunity
as expected.

But, the vaccine structure and
its level is off.

It could be live vaccine, but still...

VBT-01 subcultures were minimized.

What do you mean?

It's not really a vaccine.
It's in a state similar to the infection.

If it's in a similar state
as the infection...

If its balance with the immune serum breaks,
you can immediately become infected.

And the infected can infect others.

Of course.

Right now, that balance is a
serious problem.

It's too unstable.

Why is your expression like that?

Isn't vaccine with minimized subcultures
our last resort?

If the top method is the best method,
then there's nothing wrong using it now.

Is something wrong?

No, it's not that. I was just curious.

It seems like you're asking
many questions lately.

I'm sorry.

Doctor...

I want to ask you once more.

Please make sure Na Jung
is not used as a research subject.

Okay, I'll do that.

Ga Yeon.

I hope you do not become
a weakness for me.

If you become my weakness,
it would be a very fatal one.

I will keep that in mind.

Have you all gathered?
Yes.

Make sure they are medicate themselves
with the compound and hide their true form.

Yes, Doctor.

Hey!

Who told you,
you could leave the hospital? Huh?

I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

All the orders all a mess
because of you.

I'm sorry.
I'll start my shift right away.

Don't just say it...

Sir, I'll take care of it.

Gosh, seriously!

If you're heading out,
you should have told me.

I'm sorry.

I don't know about him,
but you can talk to me.

Yes, sir.

Okay. Get changed and come to ICU.

Yes.

A night stroll for the first time
in a long time. How refreshing.

You had a lot to manage today.

Making appearances here and there.

Although the outcome is serious.

Oh, what's with him?
Why do you keep smiling?

Because I remembered something
all of a sudden.

When I first came to work here,
you and your LA-style makeup.

Gosh, seriously.

Why are you bringing that up?
Don't do that.

Okay.

I said stop it!
Okay.

Honey...

Guess where I am!

Honey! I don't know where you are.

Where are you hiding?

I'm right here!

You're so mischievous.

This place is full of flowers so
I couldn't find you.

Oh, I don't know about that...
Let's go.

What the heck was that?

Shall we do it too? For fun?

Don't even think about it.

Just once... As a joke. It's for fun.

Even if it's a joke, I won't. I can't!

I said, don't do it...

Guess where I am!

Right there.

Goodness, you should pretend to not know
like that other guy.

How can I pretend?

When there's a talking flower...

Oh, ugh, he is crazy.

What are you going to do with my hand?
Shriveled from corniness.

I can straighten it for you.

If it's all straightened out,
I can let go.

No, it'll take a while.

<i>[32.2]</i>

Reset the CCTV recording right away.
Now!

Make sure the guards don't talk.

Do you have hormone issues or something?

You shed so much hair.

It's like that for all girls with
long hair.

You never dated a girl with long hair?

Nope.

Then what about girls with short hair?
Never dated them.

Then what about medium-length hair?
Never dated them.

Then you never dated a girl?

When an infected feels love,
the pituitary gland

over-produces phenethylamine and
oxytocin and it can be harmful.

And regulating emotions and cravings
become difficult.

Oh, I see.

But, when you were close to me and

when you held my hand before...

Were you okay?

You seemed fine on the outside.

I guess there wasn't much stimulation.

Oh...

I guess I just invoke loyalty, friendship,
colleague-ship or something like that.

There's an exception.

I didn't know this before.
I recently realized.

Even if the pituitary gland is
significantly stimulated...

if the other part gets stimulated more,
it makes things okay.

Where is the other part?

Here.

For me, it's here.

Let me conduct the experiment to
finalize my findings.

You're nervous.

I think I'll be okay.
In the future, too.

All this seems unreal... With you.

I feel the same way.

Seriously, every timings in the world
must be cursed.

Yeah.

What?

I'm sorry, Director.

I had no choice.

I'm sorry.
What happened?

It'll be okay.

Doesn't make sense.

There was no reason for suicide.

It makes no sense.

Are you the one in charge here?
Yes.

There wasn't a note or a letter,
but it's likely a suicide.

He is not the type!

He was a very cheerful person.

If there's anything else,
I'll give you a call.

Really, there wasn't anything
going on, right?

Yes.

When I last saw him,
he was smiling brightly.

There's something more, right?

I sensed a subtle smell of an infected.

Does that mean an infected came all the
way here to hurt Byung Soo?

Why Byung Soo?

I don't know either.

But, if a person unrelated to the
infection got killed by an infected...

there's only one reason.

By chance, unintentionally,
he must've learned their secret.

Just who was it that
did something like this?

The only thing we're sure of...

seeing how the smell was hard to detect,
it's an infected that uses that compound.

There's too much happening all at once.
I don't know what's going on.

The only other infected within
the hospital is the Director, right?

It could be someone from the outside.

Breaking in would be simple.

Whether it's external or internal,
there's too much exposure to danger.

To the general public, that is.

You're right. If we leave things be,
we'll have bystanders become victims.

The body temperature compound.

What about it?

The infected that take this compound...

I'm wondering if there is a way to
identify them.

Identify them?

Perhaps this compound...

might have a reaction with
other unique compound materials.

That's true.

I wonder why I didn't think of that.

How could something like this happen?

Suicide?
I'm sorry, Chairman.

I'm making sure something like
this doesn't happen again.

Taemin cannot afford to have
even a small flaw.

Yes.

What about the police and the media?

For the police,
I spoken to Chief Lee Yoon Seok.

As for the media,
they've already been blocked.

Okay. Good job.
You can head out now.

Director, I need to speak with you
for a moment.

I'm sorry. I need to head into surgery.

Oh I see. Then, I'll wait for you.

Wow! Your weight has gone up
and your blood pressure improved.

Everything's good.

At this rate,
you can get surgery next week.

Oh... I don't like surgery!

Once you get surgery,
you'll be better soon.

Okay?

What?
You always make my life so difficult.

I was going to say this next week,
but I'll just say it now.

Please take good care of Na Jung.

It feels like you're her family.

Well, she feels like my little sister.

I'll take good care of her until
the surgery.

Okay.
Don't neglect the other patient's though.

Okay.

What are you looking at?

I was really disappointed by it.

Which part of it disappointed you?

The immune serum was very roughly
put together.

How could someone as smart as you
get the golden goose

and cut it open?

Are you talking about minimized subcultures?

So you know what I'm talking about.

You knew and you still took it out?

In my judgment,
now was the time.

I find your judgment very regretful.

Since it's already been made,
good luck with that.

To put in other words,
it's like a team that's losing 20-1...

having to watch the other team on
the offense in the 9th inning.

Chief.
Yes?

It really does seem like you
have no fear.

Of course.
You really didn't have to go that far.

It would've been great if your
parents lived longer.

If they did, they would've taught you
how to have fear and manners.

How to have fear and manners...
You can keep at it.

Just be mindful of the counterpart.

I have a request, Director.

Even if the vaccine is not fully developed,
can I get it administered?

That's not possible.
It can cause a bigger problem.

That's fine. Anything is better than now,
don't you think?

I can't, Chairman.

Why is it not possible when I myself
want it?

This research was funded with my money.
So do as I ask!

Chairman. Please calm down.

I'm sorry.

I got too worked up.

I told you we are almost there.

Why aren't you listening to me?

Never let your frets cause foolishness.

Please don't forget, Chairman.

Doctor!

Oh, Ri Ta!

Wow, how long has it been?

I know, right? What brings you by?

I had a meeting with Doctor Park Do Min.

You can't just leave like this.

You should meet me or Associate Director.

Why... would I bother busy people?

Still... I actually had some questions
about my uncle.

Oh, you do? Did Associate Director
tell you everything?

About what?
Oh.

She didn't tell you?

If the Chairman comes asking to be vaccinated,
don't respond and call me right away.

Okay, will do.

But...

Weren't the patients in 21A injected with
the vaccine even though it's unstable?

Still, we can't to Chairman.

If he experiences adverse effects, we may
not be able to continue our research.

I understand what you're saying.

Chief, the data you gave me...

More specifically, VTH-16.

Yes.
It's truly amazing.

How you were able to develop such
an antibody.

Hyun Woo put in a lot of effort.

I see.

But, as you know, it's a very dangerous
immune antibody.

It'll kill off not only virus cells, but
healthy cells as well.

Additionally, I ran some reaction tests
with blood from 21A.

It was fatal as well.

The fact that we couldn't figure out why
was the reason for ending the research.

It won't be easy to find the cause.

Perhaps impossible.

I, too, re-opened the research many times,
hoping for results, but it always failed.

But, I will continue with this.

I will hold my ground with my will.

You should do that then.

Oh, how's your passive aggressive
war with Director going?

It's going well.

That's good to hear.

But, don't you think we need to
provoke him with something more?

Yes, I think so.

Aunt, your skin isn't looking
too healthy.

I have too many concerns.

I also need to wrap up acquisition
of Hanche Hotel.

Oh, right, did Uncle get a
physical examination?

That... he asked me to not say
anything to you.

He did get one.

When?

Last week at Sung Won Hospital.
He didn't want Taemin people to worry.

What about the results?

His glucose level increased a bit,
but he's okay.

I see.

That's a relief.

I was concerned about his hand tremors.

That's also because of his glucose level.

Okay.

You have to pretend not to know.

If you tell him,
I'll lose credit with the Chairman.

Okay, I'll do that.

Doctor Yoo.

Yes?
Is something wrong?

No, you should go back to work.

<i>I'm sorry. I should have told you too.</i>

She said it could be a problem at
the next shareholder's meetings.

The Associate Director was concerned.

She said we should prepare in advance,
so I told her about it.

I thought she would tell you herself.

She must have kept it from you
to keep you from worrying.

Yes.

That must have been why.

But, Doctor...

the rare illness my uncle has?

As of now,
is there no chance for recovery?

Right now, that's how it is.

And one more thing.

Is this a hereditary illness?

For you, there's a 50:50 chance.

Your father was fine.

But, that doesn't mean you will be safe.

I saw your composition.

Why don't we evaluate it together?

I thought it was really a bomb.

Wow. You're coming off extreme
right off the bat.

It's quite the antibody.
It eats up everything it touches.

Does it have a name?
Vampire to human.

VTH, the 16th version.

I like the meaning.  Anyways...

What's your reason for showing this
to me?

I thought you'd need it.

Me?
Yes.

You have a hypothetical situation.

If infection spreads through a region
because your treatment fails...

that region should be bombarded.

When you do attack,
you should use this.

I don't know.

No matter how much I think about it,
I don't think I'll need it.

Not enough time has passed
for you to make that judgment.

I'll give you more time.

I miss the days when we first met.

We were very polite with one another.

And we respected each other.

I like things much better, right now.

Also, you keep insisting that your
research is perfect.

I'm telling you, it's not.

So why did your team disperse like that?

If you had stayed with Doctor Jung
and your friends...

you would have succeeded by now.

Oh... I see.

You couldn't bring it up to them
because of pride.

'Let's work together.'

I'm more than enough on my own.

Throw away your pride
and just say it.

Then, at least, I will help you out.

What is it?

Does it hurt your pride to ask me?

Or... is it not a matter of pride?

Did you perhaps...

not get recognition from your
mentor and your friends?

Is that really it?

Or...

Let's see... did everyone say
it couldn't be done.

But, you behaved recklessly and
dangerously...

and pushed forward on your own?

Shut up.
Well now.

Why are you acting scary like this?

What do you know to talk so carelessly
in front of me?

I'm talking because I know something.

I made the right call.
Everyone was scared without even trying.

An individuals' fear nearly threw
everything down the drain.

Wasn't it your greed that you ignored your friends and mentor's conscience?

They were perfectly wrong and
they were cowards.

They never had any right to
have this to begin with.

So, they were cowards who were wrong.

And they had no right,
so you must have really hated them.

Don't talk to me in that way.

And that's what's made you think of
having it all to yourself.

I told you not to talk to me that way!

Is that why you killed them?
My parents and everyone!

That's right! I killed them!
I ordered them killed! It was me!

You didn't forget everything I said,
did you?

Whatever it is, show me everything.
I'll look at it for now and enjoy it.

You take pleasure in giving
pain to the patients.

And on top of that,
you murdered someone!

This is the last time.

The last time the Director's affection's
for you gets you special treatment.

You... I'll kill you very soon.

You say I've been bitten by a dog.

How would I stop a dog?

I've found the real reason.

I want to love with a human's heart.
