[ Beethoven's 9th Symphony ]

My spoon is too big.

My spoon is <i>too big!</i>

My <i>spoon</i> is too big.

I am a banana.

[ happy uptempo music ]

Tuesday's coming.

Did you bring your coat?

I live in a giant bucket.

Say - do you want to go see a movie?

I'm feeling fat and sassy.

[ crowd cheers ]

Dance!

Everybody dance!

Life is good!

This is fun!

My anus is bleeding!

My anus is bleeding!

For the love of God
and all that is holy!

<i>My anus is bleeding!</i>
