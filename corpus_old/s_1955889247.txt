This isn't Huntington Beach.

Okay, eat up. The bus will be

I don't know why I couldn't

Well, I love that money is no

Mom and Dad are over. This is

I've never even been in a fight.

Well, that's not true.

this girl kicked me

and I just fell down and cried,
and pee'd a little.

Thanks for sharing that with me.

Yeah. Are you really

you say gnarly?

Sure.

I've always wanted to go

Oh, because everyone thinks
I look like him.

That was intense, man.
How do you feel?

Embarrassed.
Great, me, too.

I want to show you something.
Take a look at this.

It's my own social media app.
It's called YOUniverse.

When you look at this screen,
man, what do you see?

A blank page?

You're cute, but you are so
stupid. This is you, dude.

Not the "you" you are,
the "you" you want to be.

You can be anybody.

You just gotta fill this page,
a new beginning...

Because when you put positive

<i> ( PHONE ALARM SOUNDING )</i>

Good morning. Just warming up
the pipes, don't mind me.

Good morning, Sunshine.

Good morning.

You might want to take
a look outside.

Is that my car?

That just showed up on a truck.

That's my car!

Yes, it is, and I can't
believe it.

There's no way. Where's Dad?

Probably tanning on a beach
somewhere...

and look, you need to get a job,
so you can pay for the gas...

but I will help you
with the insurance.

Okay. Oh, I knew he'd come
through.

Yes!

Yeah, I thought about trying out
for the hockey team...

but my physician said that
I have the ankle strength...

of a ten-year-old girl.

But you know, multiplayer,
online gaming...

is my real passion...
it can get pretty physical, too.

Like one time, I passed out...

after 17 straight hours
of Warcraft.

Really?
Yeah, dehydration.

I went to the doctors
and I woke up in the ER.

And then, I met my girlfriend
through League of Legends.

She's a bikini model,
her name's Guadalupe.

Hey, Lonnie, can I ask you
something?

Have you ever heard of an app
called YOUniverse?

No, and I'm on everything,
Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest.

Sure, I only have like two
followers, it's my mom...

and my granny, and my dad
blocked me for some reason.

That's weird, why would you
block your own son, right?

I haven't talked to him about
that--

Wait, wait, what's YOUniverse?

It's just something I read
about. Gotta go, see ya'!

Cool, nothing, thanks for
starting that conversation.

I'll tell Guadalupe about that.

She's my girlfriend, Guadalupe
is my girl.

No one cares? Are you
on Twitter?

Um, I don't mean for you to take
this personally...

but that was... and I say this
with the utmost respect...

I wished for happened.

Right...

Then some things that I wished
for didn't happen the way...

that I wanted them to.
I know!

Well?

Let me ask you a question.
Yeah.

If a unicorn wrote a tweet
and then posted it...

and then he put it up
and deleted it...

and then a tree fell down
in the forest...

does anybody even hear it?

What are you talking about?

Listen, that YOUniverse app...

can you tell me how
to control it?

Can you tell me if I can take
back something that I posted?

What do you want to take back?

( WOMAN SINGING OPERA )

Whoa, dude!

That's what you wished for?

Listen to me, man.
What?

You can't change the past,
that's crazy talk.

Is this forever?

No, no, I'm talking
about the app.

Oh, the app!

do to you... so great.

I'm tellin' you, these waves
were toppin' out...

like at 30 feet, 30 feet!

That's like as big as this
house! I mean that's huge!

I don't think you truly
appreciate how big this is.

Annie, give 'em the arm wave,
show 'em, show 'em.

All right, this is me
on my board, right?

This is the 30-foot wave, look
at that! This is to scale, Maxi.

Ugh, ugh, shred, shred, bleed,
bleed, pull, snap through.

Thanks, Ann. And they were just
coming, one after the other...

and I surfed 'em, all day--
all day, Allen!

Into the evening, even...

and then I fell asleep to the
sounds of that angry ocean...

just pounding the beach.

It was pretty great.

Wake up the next day and
we did it all again. What?

It was one of the best times
I've ever had in my entire life.

Except for the time you and I
rebuilt the Alpha Romeo.

That was the best time I ever
had in my life.

Hey, agreed! Born to Run!

Born to Run! Cheers to that,
my man.

Well, it's good to have
you back, Dad...

now Kyle has a shoulder
to cry on.

Maxi, chill out.

So, Darryl, what do you plan
on doing for work here?

Well, I connected with an old
skate buddy of mine...

who's got his own brand
out here in New Haven.

He's gonna hook me up with a job
doin' graphics. It's a real job.

So I hit the ground running
tomorrow.

But tonight, I just want to say,
that I am so happy to be here...

Relax, okay?

There's nothing wrong with him,
there's not a scratch on him.

New England falls.

Have you ever heard of the
Heavenly Pursuit?

What's that?

Okay, well, autumn is the time
of year that the moon...

after pursuing the sun since
spring, finally catches up...

to her, but then he out
distances her...

and the whole pursuit begins
again.

It's kind of like two lovers
who lose one another.

But his love is so powerful...

that he spends his entire life
trying to find her.

That sounds kinda tragic.

Yeah, I know, I'm a total sucker
for a tragic love story.

But I think every girl
wants a moon.

Yeah.

This has been the coolest night.

Yeah.

I don't get it.

I've lived here my whole life
and no one even knows who I am.

Come on, that's not true.

Hi, Liza.
Who are you?

Lonnie Gregory, your next door
neighbor for the past 17 years.

Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry.

Course not, hey, thanks for not
inviting me to your Sweet 16.

It was beautiful from what I saw
from the window anyways.

But that's what I mean, you.

You show up four weeks ago...

and now your life is like this
amazing fairy tale, right?

I keep thinking about it...

it's a little annoying,
actually, but in a good way.

Okay, Lonnie, I have to tell
you something.

But you gotta promise me that
you won't tell anyone. Promise?

Yeah, not even Mom.
You sure? You talk a lot.

I know I talk a lot,
just tell me.

Okay, okay, I have a magic app
on my phone...

and whatever I post on it...
comes true.

I'm sorry, what? What?
It's insane.

Oh my god, I have the same app,
I thought I was the only one.

Yeah, no, dude!

Come on, you lost your mind.
Lonnie, I'm telling the truth.

Okay, fine, if that was even
a possibility...

which I'm not saying that it is,
how would that even work?

I'll tell you, okay,
so my phone broke...

so I took it to the mall
to this bearded dude.

Bearded dude?
Bearded dude.

He gave me a new phone
with this app...

called YOUniverse on it.

The universe is always
eavesdropping.

There's this unicorn and if the
unicorn posts a tweet...

in the woods and then deletes
the tweet, does it make a sound?

Oh, man, you Californians, okay.

I'm not crazy. I'm telling you
the truth.

It does sound crazy, because
it's bullshit, all right?

Lonnie!

Look, if anyone understands the
need for fantasy, it's me.

I mean, I spend more of my time
on Azeroth than I do on earth.

But I don't go around trying
to convince people...

that I'm Archmage Khadgar
the Wizard.

Maybe you guys do things
differently in California.

Maybe it's the avocados, maybe
it's the stuff...

everyone's smoking, you know
what I'm saying?

But we don't do things
like that, no one--

What is that?

This is a gift. This is my
favorite skateboard.

Cool.
And I want to give it to you.

What?
I want you to have it.

It's for you, come on.
That's so awesome.

That's the nose, that's
the tail, and those two bolts...

are what you stand on.

Oh, I don't know, my ankles,
remember? It's the height.

Lonnie.
I'm afraid of heights.

Get on the board.

Okay, here I go, um--

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

You smell like avocados.
You smell so good.

What do you put in your hair?
It's my hair's just--

You're good.
It's so high up here.

Does anybody get a nose bleed?
You're gonna be fine, Lonnie.

How high up are we right now?
An inch.

An inch, that's a lot. Just--
what do I do now?

You kick back and enjoy
the ride.

Oh, my god, I'm getting light
hands, because it's so hot.

Whoa, whoa! What's going on!?

I'm not doing anything.
Why is it taking off?

Whoa, I'm actually skateboard--
get out of the way!

Look at me!

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Whoa, whoa--

Look at you rip, doggie!

Yeah!

Is that Grimace?

It's me, Lonnie, you don't know
my name, that's okay.

<i> Â¶ Can't you hear what I say Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Just get out of my way Â¶</i>

Watch this.

This is the coolest thing I've
ever done! Like, by far!

It's the best day of my life!

Lonnie! Lonnie!

Lonnie! You all right, man?
How many fingers?

You have fingers.

Come on, let's get you up.

You gotta watch what you're
eating-- I mean, going.

What do you think you're doing?
You could've seriously hurt him.

It's not my fault he's fat
and uncoordinated.

Yeah?

Well, if it's so easy,
why don't you try it?

Or are you just some pussy
in a letter jacket?

Look at me, I'm riding
a skateboard.

What are you doing?
Who's the pussy now, blondie?

Watch this.
It's so easy.

Whoa-- what? Whoa, slow down.

Yo, what is going on?
Yo, guys, stop this.

Yo, Oliver! Dude, hey, dude!

Stop, stop! Move back away!

( HORN HONKING )

Aren't you going to study
for the Spanish test?

I'm just gonna wing it.

Okay, wow, you know, you are
the only person I know...

that never studies and gets
all A's.

You write music?
Oh, it's nothing.

Sing something for me.

No.

Okay, shut your face,
it's not happening.

Dani, I don't know!

I've never heard of the game
Truth or Dare before!

What are you doing?
My mom will hear you.

Dani, what are you doing?
Kyle, stop it!

[DANI'S MOM]
Dani, what's going on up there?

Nothing, Mom! Nothing!

Stop it. You're a freak.

Get over there.

If you so much as roll your
eyes, I swear I'll murder you.

All right, cross my heart
and hope to die.

Drowning?

Mm-hm, yes, I know, it sounds
a little morbid...

but it's really just
a conversation...

between two people falling
in love.

Yeah, leave it to me to write a
song that sounds like a eulogy.

Whoa, wait, wait, wait,
you gotta sing it for me.

No, Kyle, no, you know I'm not--
Just a few verses, please?

Just a few verses, that's all
I'm asking for.

Agh.

Â¶ Seems like the love songs
have got it all wrong Â¶

Â¶ I thought I would fly Â¶

Â¶ And it's getting darker
the further we fall Â¶

Â¶ And I'm feeling high Â¶

That's great... here.

I think I got it.

Okay.
Keep singing.

Â¶ Remember the time
I first saw you Â¶

Â¶ I thought you'd be fine
and it felt so good Â¶

Â¶ One look in your eyes
and I swear I knew Â¶

Â¶ Of your kiss your touch
your love Â¶

Â¶ And I can't breathe
I'm struggling Â¶

Â¶ My heart's at ease Â¶

Â¶ 'Cause I'm drowning Â¶

Â¶ Drowning in your love Â¶

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>


That was bad, let me
try it again.

Oh... so close!

( BOTH LAUGHING )

( BELL RINGS )

Â¶ Now I've heard there
was a secret chord Â¶

Â¶ That David played
and pleased the Lord Â¶

Â¶ But you don't really care
for music do you Â¶

Wait, guys, guys, hold on.

Hold up. What is it now,
Pavarotti?

Mr. Moody, Dani and I have been
working on something...

that we'd love to show you.
Kyle, what are you doing?

Kyle, I've been doing
this a long time.

I think I know what song
is going to work.

I know, but Dani wrote this song
and it's tight, Mr. Moody...

just hear it out.

I'm sure it's very 'tight'.

It's just that this song
has a significance for me.

Why?

Because I sang it once.
What for?

Mr. Pookins.
Who's Mr. Pookins?

My cat.
You sang a song for your cat?

My dead cat, he died,
I sang it at his funeral.

Sorry.

It was a suicide.

Can we just play the song
for you once, please?

You won't regret it.

Do the short version.
Yeah.

You got this.

Â¶ The ocean is heavy
your current is strong Â¶

Â¶ You're pulling me deeper
been here all along Â¶

Â¶ Remember the time
I first saw you Â¶

Â¶ I thought you'd be mine
and it felt so good Â¶

Â¶ One look in your eyes
and I swear I knew Â¶

Â¶ Of your kiss your touch
your love Â¶

I can not believe Mr. Moody is
letting us perform our song.

Our song? It's your song,
I just helped.

<i> ANNOUNCER (OVER SPEAKER)
Tonight's the night...</i>

<i> Hawks hockey season opener,
be there, 7:00PM.</i>

What is with the hockey
insanity?

First game of the year
is tonight.

What's even worse is the biggest
game of the season...

is the same night as the Slam.

I'll be so surprised if anybody
even shows up.

Hey, you all should
go to the Slam!

I'm telling you, if not,
you're gonna miss out...

and you're gonna have to watch
it on YouTube.

Yeah, go!
I'm telling you.

You know, nobody but you
could've got me...

to share my music, thank you,
I'm happy I met you.

I'm kind of happy I met you.

You're so dumb.

( BELL RINGS )

I gotta go to class, bye.

Bye!
Later, gator.

Jesus.
Isn't that sweet?

The lady and the tramp were
about to have their first kiss.

What's with you, Massey?

I Google Chrome-d you... and
there's not a single mention...

of you singing anywhere
before you came to Hayden.

Something about you stinks,
and I'm gonna figure it out.

And then I'm gonna stuff
and mount you.

All I'm saying is be careful...

things are rarely what
they appear to be.

Take my girlfriend from
Honduras...

the bikini model, Guadalupe?

She turned out to be Phil
from Cleveland.

Yeah, I got Catfished...
without the TV show!

What are you getting at?

I'm sayin we don't know anything
about this bearded dude.

I mean, what if he turns out
to be some kind of like...

you know, master of dark arts.

Look, anything that got my
family back together...

can't be bad.

Yeah, speaking of family, um,
it's my birthday Saturday...

and every year, we go to my
favorite place.

It's a Greek restaurant,
there's hummus...

and there's a belly dancer.

Hm.
Yeah, I took some lessons.

She asked me to leave,
but I'm wondering...

if you wanted to go, you could
go, it's gonna be lame...

you probably-- no, forget it.

Lonnie, of course, I'm coming
to your birthday.

I wouldn't miss it.

Cool. All right, I'll just text
you all the deets and stuff.

( ALL CHEERING )

That guy is such a douche.
Yeah, but he's Emperor Douche.

And you just joined the chorus,
so you're kind of like...

at the bottom of the barrel,
too, you know?

Jealous, Chorus Boy?

No.
Hey!

Oh, gettin' a little angry?
No one cares about Kyle Moore.

I own this school and there's
not a damn thing...

you can do about it.

Down... boy.

Jokes on him, this is how I eat
my mashed potatoes, so--

Somebody has to bring that guy
in check.

Yeah, somebody's gotta check
him.

It would be kind of cool
if you went out...

for the hockey team, though,
right, beat him at his own game?

Our own little miracle on ice.

That would be so rad, dude,
so rad.

Yeah, it would.

( WHISTLE BLOWS )
Let's go! Let's go!

Pass it!

Come on! What are you, girls?
Let's go!

Come on, get up, you push!
That's the best you got?

You skate like my sister.
Bring it in!

Two-on-two back check drill.

If we're gonna beat the
Bulldogs...

we gotta get this right.

Look who it is.

Set it up!
Whoa.

Can I-- can I help you
with something?

I want a try-out, Coach.

Try-outs are over, all right?

That's too bad. I'm way
better than Derek.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's
a pretty big claim, son.

Let's hope you can back that up.
The ice is yours.

Can't wait to see this.

No, YOUniverse, we're here to
play hockey. No, no, no, no!

Not again!

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

What are you doing?

Whoa!

You can't even do that.

I can't look away.
That is so beautiful.

Holy smokes!

That's not what I meant.

Well, kid, you're no Wayne
Gretzy, but guess what...

you made the team. Boys, meet
your new equipment manager.

All right! Play time's over.
Let's go! Set 'em up.

Nice one, Cali.

Wayne Gretzky. Why didn't
I think of that.

All right, let's try this again,
shall we?

Hey, bitches! Where you goin'?
I'm not done yet.

Okay, Frozen, let's see you
score on the goalie.

Wreck him.

Get the ice packs ready.

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Get him!

Come on!

<i> Â¶ Like a boss
We are the wild beast Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ It's a bloody feast Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Like a boss
We put you on the ice Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Throw in the towel
You are the sacrifice Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ We are the warriors
We take the low road Â¶</i>

First line, get out there!

Not you, Lowe, stay put.
How you feeling, baby?

I could go all night.

Well, then get out there and
take the face off! Jeez!

Come on! Come on! All right,
whoo!

Okay, Kyle!

What are you doing? Why aren't
you out there?

Let's go. Come on, boys!

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

<i> Â¶ I am your champion Â¶</i>

Kyle, you're so cool!

Hey.
What up?

What are you wearing?

It's pretty sweet, right?

You'll never guess, I just saw a
bunch of kids rocking my jersey!

Wow.
I can't believe it, it's insane.

You know, you missed rehearsal
this morning.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

I couldn't sleep last night
after the game.

But it won't happen again.

You know, I'm a little worried
you're not gonna have...

enough time for rehearsal now.

You know that the Slam
is the same night as the game.

Dani, Chorus is way more
important to me than hockey.

I'll make it work.

Dude! I got 2,000 likes
on my last Instagram post.

What? Every time I post
something, I lose followers.

Hey, so, my parents...

they are super stoked to meet
you Saturday.

Oh, yeah, I'm psyched to meet
them, too, man.

Yeah, this is funny, they
actually don't think you exist.

My dad sat me down the other day
and he was like...

"Is this 'Kyle' another
'Gary Wiggins'?"

Who's Gary Wiggins?

He was my imaginary friend
when I was a kid.

Not anymore, because he moved
away...

he didn't leave a forwarding
address.

Anyway, my parents are super
excited that you're coming...

so I'm stoked for them to see
that you're real.

Moore!

What's up?! Good, man,
how are you?

Moore, come sit with us, my man.
We're celebrating tonight's win.

That's all right. I'll catch up
with you guys tomorrow.

No, no, go with them.

No, I gotta go home anyways
and do some gaming.

I'm a gamer, so--
You sure?

Yeah, no, celebrate.
Cool.

Yeah, go.
Okay.

Come on.
Yeah--

There he is.

So, where's Derek?

Probably picking the splinters
out of his ass...

from sitting all game.

The Zamboni saw more ice time
than he did.

Can I get you anything?

Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger,
fries and a shake.

Oh my god, Cassie, what are you
gonna name your food baby?

J-k, obviously, I'll just take
a stick of celery, please.

Hi.
Hi?

I'm Charlotte.
Yeah, I know.

Cool.

So how's it feel to be the guy
that everyone's talking about?

I don't know if that's true.

I bought a new perfume.
Do you want to smell me?

Uh... yeah. I do, I mean, sure.

Do you like it?

I-I love it.

I'm not wearing any perfume.

Cassie's having a party
this Saturday.

I am?

Oh, right, that party,
of course... I am.

Do you have plans?

Saturday, no, I don't
think so, no.

Well, now you do.

<i> Â¶ Tonight is the night
You know we gonna run Â¶</i>

( ALL CHEERING )

What's up, man?

Where you been, bro?
Everyone's out back.

Come on, let's go, let's go.

My man! Hey, you look thirsty.
Let's go.

No one told me it was
a costume party.

Don't worry about it, bro.

Boys! The man of the hour
has arrived!

To hockey! One-timers, slap
shots and kick saves!

Bone crushing hits that send
opponents to their graves.

Hat tricks, power plays and
crosschecks.

Hayden Hawks hockey, it's better
than sex!

Drink up, boys.

It's the golden boy,
the king of the ice.

Just remember, ice breaks,
and when it does...

all these people are gonna do...

is hold your little, blonde hair
under the water.

Don't worry about that.

He's just sore 'cause Charlotte
cut him loose.

Charlotte broke up with him?

OMG. Are you gonna pay any
attention to me tonight or what?

Hey, Cassie, sick party.

Do you like my costume?
I'm a very naughty brave.

Of course, I like it...
I wore it last year.

I don't remember th--

Want to go for a walk?

Yeah.

Damn, he just made Derek
disappear.

<i> ( GREEK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

What?

We thought you were over this.

Kyle is real, Mom! Okay?

He's not another Gary Wiggins!

Of course, he's not.

So, you break up with Derek?

I think we just grew apart.

I'm extremely driven, and I want
the best of everything...

life has to offer, and Derek,
well...

he seems to be skating
backwards.

I have over five million social
media followers.

I take more AP classes
than anyone else.

And I'm a state champion tennis
player.

I don't even like tennis,
it's boring. What about you?

Do you want the best of
everything life has to offer?

Yeah, yeah, I guess, I do.

Well, you're on your way.

You have the looks, the grades,
the popularity.

You're just missing one detail.

What's that?

Me.

Without me, you'll be idolized.

But with me, you'll be deified.

So, do you want me, Kyle?
Because I want you.

Sorry. Oh, no! I totally forgot.
I gotta go, I'm so sorry.

Kyle... our lives are made up
of seemingly simple decisions.

This decision, right here,
right now, is one of yours.

So you have to ask yourself...

do you want to be a god
or don't you?

Dani! Dani, wait!

Sorry.

Hey, are you okay?

You know, that was a really cute
picture Charlotte posted...

of the two of you, at least,
I think it was you.

You know, I couldn't quite
tell...

because she was practically
swallowing your face.

I was gonna tell you, th--

Why? We're just buddies.
You don't owe me anything.

I'm happy for you, Kyle,
you're the new Derek.

Hey! Hey! I'm still me.

Are you sure about that?

Lonnie. Lonnie!

Moore! Yeah, baby, let's go!

<i> ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Come on, now, kid!
Moore, wake up!

on a clock!

Now get your head out of your
backside! Skate!

Oh, come on!

Congratulations, boys...

that was the worst practice
we have ever had!

What's up, Grimace?
Do it, Grimace.

Hey.
What do you want?

Look, I'm sorry I missed your
party, all right?

You embarrassed me. I thought we
were friends.

We are. Look, you don't have
to be the person...

people pick on anymore.

You want to go on your magic app
and change me, too?

Yes! Yes, you can be whoever,
whatever you want.

We can rule the school together.
We can do whatever.

I am who I want to be.
You're the one who changed.

You know what? You, and that
thing-- that's a virus.

You've catfished yourself.

<i> MAN (OVER SPEAKER)
Alden residence.</i>

Kyle Moore... here.

( DOOR BELL RINGS )

Hey-- oh, no, Kyle.

What? What's wrong?

You drove that old thing here?

Charlotte, it's a classic
Alfa Romeo.

Hide it and take it around the
back and park it with the help.

Say something.

So, Mr. Alden, Charlotte tells
me you're a lawyer?

Where did you say you were
from again, Carl?

It's Kyle, Daddy.

California, sir.

Sun-baked hippies. What does
your father do for work?

He was a professional
skateboarder.

Professional... skate...
boarder.

But now, well, he's an
entrepreneur.

Entrepreneur, that's a fancy
word for 'unemployed'.

Kyle just got named captain
of the hockey team.

Brutish sport. I'm going to cut
to the chase.

You're a nice looking,
young man.

But the truth is, you're just
not one of us.

Daddy, he's the most popular
boy at school!

It's for the best, trust me,
poopy.

Dad!
Can I use the bathroom?

Masterson, show the boy
to the washroom...

and make sure he doesn't
steal anything.

Now, poopy, don't pout,
you'll give yourself wrinkles.

Not one of you, huh?

Let's see what you think
of me now.

So, how are we doin' in here?

Kyle! I was starting to miss
you, son. Weren't we, Pet?

We certainly were.

Daddy? Are you feeling okay?

Never been better.

And Kyle, call me Dutch,
Mr. Alden sounds so stodgy.

Well, Dutch, you are a bit
'stodgy'.

To be honest, I don't know
how Kathy puts up with you.

You son-of-a-gun.

You're terrible.

He's so awful, it takes me
three of these...

just to get through dinner!

She's plowed 24/7. I'm so awful,
I can't stand to be around me!

Just trying to get away
from myself.

Hey, Masterson, can you stand
me? Be honest. He hates my guts!

I think it's time for dessert.

Kyle, would you give me a hand
in the kitchen?

I'd love to.

Look.
Enough of that.

You're the greatest. Now there's
a real man.

Mm, smells good, what's cookin',
Kath?

You and me.

Mrs. Alden, what are you doing?

Let's run away together,
far, far away from here.

Uh, your husband's in the
other room.

I love you. You need someone
more flexible.

I was a ballerina, you know.

That's great, whoa!

Oh, I like that game.

This is out of control.
This needs to stop right now.

I'm totally out of control
and I don't give a damn!

Hi, Pet.
No, no, no, stop!

Hey!

Come to me, my little pet.
Come to me!

Mrs. Alden, chill!
Just don't ever say no.

Stop! Stop!

Oh, oh, yes! Oh, baby!

More-- what?

<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Okay. Come on, don't do this
to me, YOUniverse!

you doing?

Kyle! Come back, Kyle!

Oh god!

Wait up, wait up, two minutes!

What?

Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

Excuse me, have you seen the
Bearded Dude?

Could you be a little more
specific?

Real weird, makes bird noises...

he had a kiosk over here
and he sold phones.

Are you sure you're in the
right mall?

Because we don't allow sales
carts in here.

Yes, I'm in the right mall.
I've seen him here twice!

Sir, are you under the

I'm not even old enough
to drink.

I need the YOUniverse app!

Sorry.

Maxi? What's going on?

They're fighting again.

get that job.

I mean seriously...

what do you want me to do,
put in an application...

at the local coffee shop?

Let me tell you something...

that's never gonna happen,
because that ain't me, babe.

I did not ask you to come here,
but you came here on your own.

I don't why. Do you want
it to work?

Show me that you're trying!
You need to be responsible.

Don't come at me with
responsibility...

you always do that.

Listen, I know about
responsibility, all right?

Oh, do you?
Yes.

Do you?
Yes.

You know, Kyle still thinks that
you wanted him...

to live with you, and I pulled
him away from his dad...

and moved him across country,
because I'm a bad person.

And I don't dare tell him
the truth, I don't dare...

it would break his heart.

I'm sick of covering for you
all the time...

I'm sick of being the
bad person.

Who took a dump in Anthony's
trumpet? Nobody?

Because that's what it sounded
like. So let's try that again.

One, two, three...

Â¶ You took on the love
and played the fool Â¶

Â¶ I found there's no getting
over you Â¶

All right, the only problem
I have with what you just did...

is that it sounded terrible.

You know what?

Whatever's going on between you
two, figure it out, fast.

All right, from the top,
here we go.

I'm sorry. I can't do this.

You can't do it? It's your song.
You wrote it!

You're gonna have to do
it without me.

Wait. You shouldn't quit...
I should.

No, no, no, actually, you
shouldn't quit, either.

Neither should-- stop quitting!
Everybody stop quitting!

The Slam is in five days,
you can not quit, Kyle.

I just did.

<i> ( MARCHING BAND PLAYING )</i>

<i> PRINCIPAL KIM (OVER SPEAKER)
All right, let's make some...</i>

<i>noise, 'cause Coach Milligan...</i>

<i> and our undefeated,
hot hockey team!</i>

Thank you. Thanks. We came in
second place last year.

One point shy of our first trip
to the state championship...

in 20 long, agonizing years.

The last 365 days have been
very tough on coach.

I shed a lot of tears. My wife
and dog left me.

I woke up one morning naked
in a chicken coop.

And I might have killed a man.

( CLEARS THROAT )

But that is all in the past,
because tomorrow night...

we get our first shot
at redemption. Yes!

The reign of the Bulldogs
is over!

This is the year of the Hawks!

I would like to hand the stage
over to the captain...

of our team and the man who is
gonna lead us all the way...

to the Connecticut Cup,
Kyle Moore!

<i> ( MARCHING BAND PLAYING )</i>

Wow, thanks, thanks so much.

It's been a fast and furious
ride ever since I got here.

Don't you mean fast and
fraudulent ride?

He's got you all believing he's
a singer, and a hockey player...

and worst of all...
a heterosexual.

But he's none of these things.
Not without his magic app!

He's got a magic app on his
phone that allows him...

to be whoever and whatever
he wants!

This boy you all worship
is a lie!

You're an idiot! Boo!

It's the truth! I'm telling you!

Did you hear me? It's a magic
app! On his phone!

All right, come on, let's go,
buddy.

He's a nobody! He's a... nobody!

Wait, wait, hold on, I gotta be
honest about some things.

It's true, four or five weeks
ago, I'd never played...

a game of hockey in my life,
I never ice skated.

I've never even held a stick.

He's like the Roy Hobbs
of hockey!

No, listen to me. I don't
deserve any of this attention.

I'm--
An incredibly modest superstar!

No! I'm trying to tell you!
I'm a fake, a phony!

I don't even know who I am--

A role model to everyone
here tonight.

Exactly!

Unless we lose to the
Bulldogs...

and then he's dead to everyone
of us. Let's light this fire!

Kyle?

Dani-- Dani, wait, please.

What do you want from me, Kyle?
You have everything.

You have the fame, the glory.
You even have the girl.

What more could you possibly
want?

I don't want any of it. This,
these clothes, this isn't me.

You know that.

If I could take it all back
right now...

if I could erase everything,
I would.

Okay, then why don't you?
Because I-- I can't.

You can't?

Look... everything Brian
said was true.

There's this app and everything
I wish for comes true.

And I wished that I could sing,
so I could get close to you...

and then it happened, and then,
so did everything else.

And I... I wanna take it
all back, Dani...

but there's nothing I can do.

Let me just get this straight.

You've been a jerk,
because of an app?

I know it sounds crazy.

You know what's even crazier?

I wrote Drowning the day after
you took me on the Ferris wheel.

<i> ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Hey, can I have your autograph?

It's been a really long--

Turn down for what!?

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

( KNOCK ON DOOR )

You ready to get up?

I'm not going to school today.

What now?

I just don't want to go.

Well, that's not really
a reason.

You have to convince me
to let you stay home.

What is it? What's going
on with you?

I posted some things on social
media, and I've hurt people.

And it all keeps getting worse,
and I've really messed up.

Okay, well, when you mess up,
and you're gonna mess up...

the only thing you can do
is take ownership of it...

and try to make it right,
that's it.

It's like ripping off
a Band-aid.

It's gonna hurt, but just
do it and it's done.

And look, social media, that
stuff isn't real, you know that.

It's just everybody's highlight
reel of the stuff they want...

you to see, it's all bullshit.

It's bullshit with a filter
on it, to make it look pretty.

Let's eat. Get up!

Hey, Mom... you look really
pretty today.

Thank you... but you still
have to go to school.

Good morning, family, huh?

What's for breakfast?
I'm starving.


French toast, sounds good.
Hey, you know what?

You and I ought to go down
to the park...

and do some skating today,
that's what we should do.

Well, how's that job going, Dad?

Wow, right out of the gates,
huh? Just--

Well, if you gotta know,
that one didn't pan out.

I gotta lot of good leads,
though, so don't sweat it.

More importantly, do we
got any powdered sugar...

to go with that French toast?

Only Annie knows the answer.
Annie, talk to me!

Powdered sugar!

Wait, Mom, sit down.

You okay, killer? You're acting
a little weird.

I'm fine.

But Mom's not getting your
breakfast today...

or any other day, the free
ride stops right now.

What are you-- what are you
talkin' about?

What's going on here?
Did I miss something?

Did you say something to him?
Darryl.

Clearly you said something
to him, he's all worked up.

Leave her out of this.
I didn't say anything.

This is about you and me.
Is it?

Yeah.
All right.

Well, what is it about
you and me?

When Mom moved me away from you,
I was so angry...

and hurt, and alone.

She took me away from my best
friend, my hero.

I would have done anything for
you to come back in my life...

but the truth is, you didn't
even want me.

You didn't even want me.

I was so wrong, and I made Mom
go through hell because of it.

But Mom, Maxi and I, we deserve
somebody who wants to be...

with us, and you deserve
to live your life.

As hard as that is,
I get it now.

Maxi? You feel the same way?

Grampa, I know how you feel.

All right.

I guess you're the man of the
house... congratulations.

I'm gonna go get my breakfast
elsewhere.

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Xing-fu, hey.
Hey.

Xing-fu.

Hey, Kyle...

I'm sorry for being
such a lousy, little sister.

I could do a lot worse.

( KNOCK ON DOOR )

Hi, Mr. Gregory?
Yes?

I'm Kyle Moore, I just wanted to
drop by and say hello...

I'm Lonnie's friend.

Good god in heaven, you're real.

Honey! Honey! Come quick!

What is it?

This is Kyle, Lonnie's friend!

Did he put you up to this?
Is he paying you?

No, Lonnie's really my friend,
to be honest...

he's actually my best friend.

Hey, Lonnie.

I gotta go, but it was great
meeting you guys.

The pleasure's ours.

Come back again! Soon! Please!

Lonnie! Wait up, man!

Leave me alone, Kyle.

Hey, don't push off with your
front foot, that's mongo.

Don't tell me what to do.

Hey, so get this, I met this guy
in Cleveland...

says he's a bikini model
named Phil.

You're lucky you're
my only friend.

I'm back, buddy.

Kyle? Kyle! What are you doing?

If it isn't the prince
of popularity.

What are you doing over here
with us lepers?

You don't look so good, bud.

Well, let's see, I lost my girl,
I lost my scholarships.

Coach demoted me to fourth line.

My friends want nothing to do
with me...

and now my dad's talking about
sending me to military school.

So yeah, life's great,
I'm doing fantastic.

You got something on your face.

I don't care.

What is Kyle doing with that
loser?

So gross.
I can't believe I dated him.

I can't believe I slept...
through third period.

LOL.

Come on, Derek, where's that
clean cut, confident guy...

that I hated a few months ago?

He's you now. I gotta go.

Wait, wait, wait.

Look, man, this isn't me.
I don't want to be this guy.

I want to help you get
on top again.

I don't know what your game is,
all right, but if you're...

looking to bury me some more,
give it your best shot.

There's no angle here. I just
want to make things right.

<i> ( MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

Â¶ I thought you'd be mine
and it felt so good Â¶

Â¶ One look in your eyes
and I swear I knew Â¶

Â¶ Love your kiss your touch-- Â¶

( WHISTLES )

Hold on, everybody. Hold on,
thank you.

Dani... what's the matter,
honey, talk to me.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry, it's the song,
it was written as a duet...

I don't think I can sing it.

It's beautiful and you sing
it so well.

It just doesn't feel right
anymore.

Is there any way we could go
back to Hallelujah... please?

Oh, my god, these girls with
their boy problems.

Okay, everybody, Hallelujah,
from the top.

[MR. MOODY] All right,
you remember how that goes.

Horns, you want to get your
spittle out now...

so we don't have to watch
that later? Here we go.

Whoa... Charlotte, hey,
didn't see you stalking...

standing there.

Have you been ignoring me?

No, why would I be ignoring you?
No, I've just--

You've been ignoring my texts...

you've been ignoring me
at lunch.

You ignored me at the bonfire.
I will not be ignored, Kyle.

Shh!

Shut up! I will eat
your children!

Okay.

( DOOR CLOSES )

I don't want to fight you.
I just want to love you.

I love you so much.

We're gonna be together forever.

Good luck at the game tonight.

I'll be watching every
little step.

Oh, my god.

Look for the opening!


Nice move! Move it up,

( WHISTLE BLOWS )

No!

What the--

No, no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

Yo, kid, where does it hurt?

It hurts right there where
you're touching it, ow.

Sorry, my bad. Listen-- look at
me! I'm gonna tell you a story.

I once played with a broken
back, a broken pubis...

a broken leg, an infected
urethra...

and one hell of an epic
hangover!

So you are gonna be fine!
Now help him up! Jeez!

Okay, he's good. He's okay!

I can't do it, Coach.
I can't do it.

So that's a no? Or--

Don't make me do it, Coach.

Get him off the ice.


Back to the chicken coop.

Coach!
What?

Put me in.

Coach.
What?

Stop crying.
I'm not crying.

Stop it. I'm gonna win this game
for us.

Coach!
Yeah.

Listen to me, put me in.

Okay.
Now.

Okay, you're in. Go get him,
kid! Go get him, kid!

( CROWD CHEERING )

Get back out there, guys.

I'll find you a doctor.

That was awesome. You totally
deserve an Oscar.

Have you thought about acting?
I wasn't acting.

Oh, sorry, dude.
So, we gotta go.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Text my sister.

Have everyone meet us
at the Slam.

Okay.

Dude, why'd you park there?

It's super cool!

Nice, Lonnie.

Speed Racer. Wait! Wait up!

You'll have to get
through me first.

The Cutler High School band
and chorus.

All right, this is your
big moment.

If you go out there and do what
you can do, you will fail...

because you're not ready
and you're not talented.

I am so nervous, I'm sweating
like a wino in a liquor store.

We're all gonna die. I have gas.
Is there a toilet--

Mr. Moody!
Oh, hello!

When are you gonna get the
message...

to stay away from my girl?

Brian... you're gay...

and that's okay, just be
yourself.

Whoa!

Too soon?

But, I th-- okay.

You're gonna need this.
Thank you.

All right, go get 'em, man.

<i>Ladies and gentleman, next up,
our very own Hayden Hawks!</i>

Okay, kids, talent does what it
can, genius does what it must.

But you do what no one else
wants to do, go out there...

and stick to your guns, even
though they're not loaded.

And remember, Mr. Pookins is
listening from heaven.

So a big meow for him.
Meow... but not too loud.

Meow.
