Sit down and think

About what

You did...

Wrong.

We're always given a choice,
ladies and gentlemen,

Whether to walk the path
of the straight and narrow,

Or to succumb
to temptation.

Do i write the essay myself

Or do i copy it verbatim
from wikipedia?

Not that bright,
van olsen.

See these questions,
this choice,

<i>comes down to the core
of who you are.</i>

Detention now

Leads to prison
later, fellas.

<i>so this time
is for sitting down</i>

And thinking about
how you got from here...

To here.

<i>it's about accountability.</i>

It's about responsibility,

<i>community.</i>

Damon drecker, can i see you
out in the hall, please?

No talking.

What the hell did you do
to get detention?

Nothing.

Powell called mrs. butchik

"mrs. buttcheeks."

Butchik is her
given name, son.

you shouldn't make fun.
powell said it, not me.

Who is powell?
this guy?

<i>yeah.</i>

Why are you here?

Just hanging with him.

All right, let me
get this straight,
you didn't get detention.

You just decided to spend
the afternoon hanging out

In detention with
this kid powell.

Yeah, we're friends.

What, dad?

I don't know.
you know...

are you homophobic?
what are you talking about?

I'm asking you questions
about your life.

Come on.

I don't get to see you
that much these days.

Powell's not into
labels, dad.

And quite frankly,
neither am i.

Okay, damester.

<i>ray's voice:
now i'm not above admitting</i>

<i>george clooney's
a handsome man,</i>

<i>but this was
a whole other thing.</i>

<i>damon and i, we used to
tell each other everything.</i>

<i>( phone ringing )</i>

hello?
hi, patty.

It's me, tanya.

Why are you calling me?

I wanted to follow up
about your, um...

Appointment with
the happiness consultant.

I'm working on
the hollopaw deal right now.

I know.  i didn't
want to bother you,
but how was it?

i don't want
to talk about it.
why not?

Just let it die,
okay, tanya?

Patty, i don't understand.

If by your own assertion
the sex was great,

Then shouldn't you
be happy?

Have you ever
done coke, tanya?

Cocaine?

Uh, no.

I tried peyote
a couple of times.

Well, having sex with that
guy is like doing coke.

It's expensive,
but you really want it,

So you buy it and then you
get this huge awesome rush.

That's a good thing, right?
a huge awesome rush.

But then you come down
from your high

And you're broke
and you feel even lonelier
and more pathetic

Than you did before
and you want to
kill yourself.

So i guess you won't
be interested

In our bimonthly package?

I'm kidding.
patty, look, wait.

Seriously, what would
make you interested in
being a repeat customer?

I don't know.

maybe if he was like crack.
crack?

Yeah, cheap, dirty,
same high at half the price.

I think my kid's a gay.

damon?
yeah.

( exhales )

Well, that's great, ray.

I mean, don't worry.
lots of kids experiment
with their sexuality.

I myself, i had
a little thing

With this woman
miriam in college--

Hey, i don't need
to hear about your
lesbian past, tanya.

We're having
a business meeting.
this is business.

Then i'm gonna be
honest with you, ray.

We are encountering a little

<i>pushback in our pricing.</i>

I think we might
need to consider

Lowering our pricing point,

Maybe offering
a sliding scale

To our lower
income clients.

What are you talking about?
when we started this thing

It was you that said we were
gonna clear two grand a night.

i know.
i know i said that.
( phone ringing )

But do you watch
cable news?

Oh my god, it's pierce.
hang on a second, ray.

It's pierce.
pierce, are you there?

<i>- tanya.
where are you?</i>

<i>- cuba. god, i miss you.
i miss you too.</i>

<i>- where are you?
havana, cuba.</i>

<i>it's a long story.
i'll be back in a few days.</i>

<i>- what?
fucki'm running out
of minutes.</i>

<i>i've got to go,
but i love you.</i>

Who was that?

My boyfriend.

He had to go on a trip.

See? that's what
i'm talking about.

What?

You. you spend all your
time with this new boyfriend,

Meanwhile our business
is falling apart.

All my time?
what are you talking about?

How can i be spending
all my time with my new
boyfriend when he's in cuba?

Now, ray,
i know you're upset

About damon's homosexual
tendencies--

Hey hey, i promised my kids
they could move back in.

The two grand from jemma
is a drop in the bucket.

This house is not
gonna fix itself.

<i>( sighs )</i>

I mean, who do i have
to fuck around here
to get my kids back?

I'm trying, ray.
i'm really trying.

These are turbulent times.

Ray, i don't think
it sounds right when you say
"my kid's a gay."

Just, "my kid's gay."

Why didn't you tell me?

There's nothing to tell.

You didn't seem
that interested.

I thought you were
too obsessed with hammer
to notice anything anyway.

Have you had sex
with him yet?

damon.
what's it to you, darb?

You're my twin brother.
why wouldn't you want
to tell me?

Why do you want
to know so bad?

Because i care.
come on.

All right, i haven't
had sex with him.

Yet.

Wait, do you want to?

It's okay.
don't worry.

I mean, guys are
really easy to please.

Go!  come on,
you're almost there, guys.

I give 'em 10 bucks
every time they reach the top.

It's my secret
weight-loss plan.

Sounds good.

Don't worry, i gave up
pilates to pay for it.

It doesn't matter.

Of course it matters.

I don't need things.

Material stuff.

Ron, what do i have to do
to make you believe me?

Why did you and your mother
go through my stuff?

What did you think
you were looking for?

Did you think
i was lying to you?

Where you worried
that i was broke?

It was a moment
of weakness.

I don't care
about the money.

What about
your ex-husband?

I do not care
about him either.

I love you, ron.

( sighs )

I just want things
to be normal again.

How do we be normal?

I passed signs
for that sale you love.

The timson bank sale.

what about it?
i want you to go.

No, we can't
afford it, ron.

Look at me.

I'm tired of our lives

Being reduced to
how much money we have.

I'm sick of it.
so what?

We took a hit.
everybody did.

Now go.
i want you to go
to the sale.

I want you
to buy something.
be happy.

For me.

It's this amazing
new service

A friend of mine runs.

For male prostitutes?

Isn't that
kind of gross?

Not at all.
i think you would
feel empowered.

I know i did.

I don't know.

Well, i know patty
felt empowered too.

Great.

It's a progressive service.
it's very sensitive.

In no way dirty.

Unless you like dirty.

She said it was
like doing coke.

I've never tired
coke myself.

I did peyote
a couple times.

I know the economy
is collapsing,

But heck, when you look
back at your life

Do you really want to say
to yourself, "damn it!

I was such a fuddy-duddy.
i never once paid for sex.

Not even once."

Good boy.
oh yes, that's a good boy.

Hello.
hi.

Wow, you have a dog?
what's its name?

Patty.

Horny patty, actually.

You named your dog
horny patty?

Yeah, i did.

Wonder why i'd do that?
any ideas?

Lenore, are you mad at me?
is that why you asked
me to lunch?

I do have a little bone
to pick with you, t-brain.

I ran into horny patty
at the mall

And she told me
that you told her

That happiness consultants
was my escort service.

You're using my name
to hawk your product.

Lenore, in that one instance
i did use your name.

i'm sorry.
well, you owe me one.

So how is business
anyway?

Business is brisk.

I'll bet.

I was thinking i could
use a little ray
myself, actually.

You mean randall.

No, i mean ray.

I d his wallet, tanya.
i know his name.

Lenore, ray's dance card
is very full.

Okay, well, why don't
you just send me over
one of your other guys?

You don't have any other
guys, do you, t-brain?

No, you just have the one.

Lenore, i'm in the process
of building a stable

Of qualified professionals.

Don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

You're smart.
you do one thing
and you do it well.

Ray's a hot commodity.

He's the right age,
he's got a big fat dick

And he knows
how to use it.

Send him over tonight.

Lenore, you stole his wallet
and his underwear.

He's never
gonna go for it.

Cash upfront.

I'm free after 10:00.

<i>ray's voice:
lenore again.</i>

<i>tanya should have
never sent me there.</i>

what are we doing here?
a friend of mine owns it.

a friend of yours owns it?
that's right.

I left my wallet in the car,

So don't get
any bright ideas.

I already got a suit.

Yeah, that's
a crap suit, ray.

Try this on.

what, here?
yeah.

Go ahead. it's not like
i haven't seen you in
the buff before.

So how's it going
with tanya?

It's going all right.

She's funny, that one.

She means well.

What do you mean?

I don't know.
just funny.

How much do you think
these shoes are worth?

I don't know.

$79.99.
how about these?

No idea.

$1,250.

Whew.
come on.

Do you know why?
branding.

These shoes are
christian louboutin.

These shoes are shit.

Women buy the louboutin because
they're buying quality.

But more importantly
they're buying what
the louboutin represent--

The best.

Sound to me like
you're getting a bad deal.

They don't care.

<i>that's the crucial thing
you need to remember.</i>

Paying more
doesn't bother them.

It gives them
peace of mind.

If they wear
something of value,

That means that they
in turn have value.

You shouldn't be lowering
your price in this economy,

You should be raising it.

This is something that tanya
will never understand.

That's hot.

No no no, keep the suit.

All right.

Hold on.

It's time to diversify.

Listen, not all women can
come from just dick alone.

I haven't heard
any complaints.

That you know of.

It's gonna cost you extra.

( groans )

Jesus.

( laughs )
oh my god.

You know, some guys
have a problem with it,

But not me.
i just...

You know,
have to like the lady.

Like the lady?

What are you,
a bible salesman?

You don't need
to like the lady.

You just need to...

Like the cash.

One of the many
words of wisdom

Ñ
that will fall from my mouth
if you play on my team.

comfy?
yeah.

Oh, that's good, ray.

Oh, that's--

That's actually quite--

( moans )

Oh god.
oh goodness.

That's really good.

Ray, you really need
to come play on my team.

We should team up.
listen, tanya, she doesn't
know anyone.

She has no access
to wealth.

She can't get you
what you need.

Tanya's my friend.

She's also my partner.

Am i paying
to argue with you?

Oh god!

Oh my god.

You're playing
in the minors, ray.

You are a major league guy
playing on a minor league team.

( moans )

A major league guy playing

For a minor league team.

( moaning loudly )

( toilet flushes )

( sighs )
okay.

( screams )

You talking
shit about me?

No, patty.
absolutely not.

This is my workplace.

You're telling people
i do coke and heroin?

i never said
a word about heroin.
listen up!

Just because you
talked me into paying
for sex with some guy

With a big dick
does not give you
the right to talk about it.

Don't you ever talk
about me or to me again

Or i will kick
your ass sideways.

do you understand?
yes.

you understand?
yes, uh-huh.

( whispering )
tty paid for sex?

Linda.

you never called me.
excuse me?

From the nail salon.
i offended you with
my potty mouth.

Oh, hi.

lenore.
right.

Oh, don't, no.
no no, don't buy that.

That's just a chloe
knock-off from last season.

There's a way cuter chemise
over in the armani section.

Come on, i'll show you.

Oh, wait, no.
i just wanted to get
something on sale.

oh,
yeah.

You know what?
you can paw through
the racks if you want,

But i'm gonna tell
you a little secret.

I can get you
the same exact discount

On the new
designer collection.
come on.

Do you work here
or something?

Kind of.
i'm a lifestylist.

Lifestylist?

Yeah, kind of a combo

Life coach and stylist.

I help people maximize
their personal style.

Oh.

Through, you know, fashion,
home decorating, fitness.

what size are you, a two?
i used to be.

Now i'm a four.
every since the divorce

I just haven't found
time to work out.

colonics.
really?

It sucks it right out of you.
the pounds just drop off.

i have a guy.
really?

Okay, try this dress
with this jacket.

No, i really shouldn't.
i did just want to

Just pick up
something on sale.

Oh, all right.
i just thought that the cut

Would help with
your, um... problem area.

You think?

I'm taking a little survey.

Can you have an orgasm
from just cock

Or do you need a guy
to go down on you to get off?

I can't answer that.

I've asked a bunch
of my clients.

Seems like the ratio
is 60-40 tongue to dick.

Well?

Tongue helps.

( both laugh )

That looks amazing.

Tanya:
and then the happiness
consultant meets you

At a destination
of your choice

For a night
of erotic adventure.

Sounds good.

Uh, now there's the small
matter of payment.

Lenore likes for her
clients to pay upfront.

Great.

Oh, i'm sorry, linda.
we'll need the full amount.

Uh...

Our service costs $600.

I have 50.

You said there was
a sliding scale.

Right.
there is.

Okay, i get it.

We can offer you $100 off

And give you our
service for $400.

I mean 500.

$100 off 600.

Oh.

I can pay 50.

Linda, i don't understand
what you're saying to me.

$400 is my final offer.

50.

Linda--
linda, this is insulting.

No no no, it really is.

No deal.

Uh, i'd like
a brioche, please.

Sure.

that's terrible.
( jessica laughs )

same thing,
different color.
oh.

I'm sorry, jessica.
what the hell?

i look great in that.
yeah, in 1989 maybe.

But no longer, no.

<i>ronnie:
jess, are you home?</i>

Oh, hey, ron.
come upstairs.

I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

hey, baby.
oh, you're home.

Lenore, this is ron.

Ron, lenore.

Hi.
so nice to meet you.

You guys went shopping?

I know.  i was only gonna
pick up one little thing.

But then i met lenore
and she's amazing.

She helped me find
the best stuff.

I just help women
be their best selves.

And you bought all this?

<i>i know it looks
like a lot,</i>

But lenore gets a 15% discount
on every item over 100 bucks.

Um, i...

Got this one for you.

That's great, jess.

What's the return policy
on this stuff?

All sales are final
'cause of the discount.

Okay, great.
that-- that-- great.

Nice to meet you, lenore.

Ron, are you mad?

No.  no, i'm happy
when you're happy, jess.

Jessica, stop it.

Stop what?

Stop handing out
your love

Like you're
a 10th grade slut.

<i>stop letting your kids
and your husband</i>

Walk all over you.

Repeat after me--

I have the power.
say it.

Oh...

Say it.

I have the power.

Say it again.

( whispers )
i have the power.

i don't believe you.
i have the motherfucking
power!

( giggles )

50 bucks?
that's insulting.

Why are we even
talking about it?

It's actually not
that insulting, ray.

Patty said you
were like cocaine.

She compared you
to crack.

okay?
shh!

That's the effect
you have on these women.

So just have sex
with linda.

Just give her a taste.
give her a little bump.

And then she'll keep
coming back for more.

Lenore says
we should be charging

1500 bucks a pop
for a night with me.

Well, i'd like to see her
try to get 1500 bucks.

She says we should
be raising our prices,
not lowering them.

These women, they need
to feel like they're
worth something.

Wait, when were you
talking to lenore about
all of this?

When we were having sex.

Ray, don't talk to lenore.

I'm not comfortable
with that.

Who do you want me
to talk to instead?

Talk to me.

We are going
to figure this out.

ray.
i'm late for detention.

I believe in us.
