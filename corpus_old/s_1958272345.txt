This thing's not working.

Alright, look...

All right, it's probably the cable

Get down from there.

Hey!

[gate shuts]

Didn't I fucking tell you!

You're not suppose
to work on cars here!

It's not a fucking garage!

It says in the lease...

you're not suppose to wash cars,

paint cars,

or fucking repair cars!

How hard is that to understand?!

I'm writing you a three
day notice, you hear me?




You're fucking out of here!

Yeah...

if I get a three day notice...

you're getting a fucking
one day notice.


I'm not afraid of you.

We'll see.


[ratchet turns]

Loser!

I'm getting rid of that guy
the first chance I get.

You're the captain of the ship.

You can do whatever it
is you want, right?

That's right.

I am the captain.

And that fucker is out of here.

Star?


You all right?

Yeah... I'm okay.


I can't believe
they're both dead.

Me neither.

Hey, huh, I'm sorry.

Thanks.

I always knew that Daniel
was trouble.

But don't worry...

cuz, if he shows his
face around here...

I'm going to get him.

Who's this Daniel guy?

He's a fucking maniac, that's who.

A couple of years ago, he put
a knife to Brittany's throat

when she tried to break up with him.


We all testified against him
and they put him away.

[Rob scoffs]

Can you believe they let him
out early for good behavior?

The system's pathetic.

I swear to God

if that psycho comes near me...

I've got a gun and I
will kill him.

Okay, look, move, let me see.


What's this wire doing here?

I...

I, uh, added a second camera.

That's why it's not working.

You need a splitter if you're
going to add another camera.


Well, I didn't know.

[TV clicks on]

What the fuck?

You out a camera in her
bedroom, are you nuts?

It's pretty fucking cool, right?


You can watch this chick dance
nude any day of the week.

That's an act, man. This is real!


You're sick! Do you know
how illegal this is?

What?

That's three to five in the State
pen. It's invasion of privacy.

You serious?

I'm dead serious.


Oh.


Look, because you're my
friend, I never saw this.

But, you gotta get that camera
out of her apartment today.

Do you understand?

I'll get it out as soon
as she leaves.

You better.

Alright, we've got a serial
killer out there.

No shit Sherlock,
his name is Daniel.

I don't think it's him.

Oh, come on, of course it's
him. He wants revenge.

We studied serial killers
in my criminology class

and the missing hands indicate
that the motive is not revenge.

Would you cut the bullshit.

You don't need a college
degree to figure out

that Daniel is the
one killing them.

He's a suspect and
we're looking for him.

And what if you
can't catch him?

We're doing the best we can.

Well, that's not good enough.

Our lives are in danger.

They shouldn't have let that maniac
out of prison in the first place.

You know, it's you
and your system,

you're the reason that Chloe,
Michele, and Brittany are dead.

Let's not point fingers here,
okay, it's not Sonny's fault.

Let's all just calm down.

Fuck that, calm down.

-My life is in danger.
-[Sonny groans]

You see these?

These aren't collectibles!

Look!

Just stay in your apartment.

All of you.

[helicopter in the distance]

There will be an officer on
premises around the clock.

Just sit tight until
we get him.

And what if you
don't get him?

Just stay in your apartment
and let us do our job.

â™ª [ominous music] â™ª

We're all really scared.

Honey...

we'll get through this.

Sonny, I don't know if I'm
going to make it through this.

There's a psycho out
there stalking us.

We don't know who or why

and I feel like running
away and hiding.

Not without me, you're not.

Who am I kidding?

Okay, I have nothing. I have
no life. I have no future.

And I got rejected
from another law school.

Hey.

Hey.

You still got me.


Sonny, we don't
have anything.

Okay, this isn't working.

What the hell are you
talking about?

We're going nowhere.

I don't believe this shit.


I need to rethink my life.

Well, that's bullshit,

Are you nuts?

At least we have police

She's right.

[inhales loudly]

Yeah, I should feel real

I think it's safer at the club.

Sonny said, we should

we should stay together.

Poor, Brittany.

He made her life
a total nightmare.

Always beating her up.

When she tried to
break up with him

he nearly killed
her with a knife.

We had to do something.

He's going out for revenge.

Yeah.

Well, let me tell

the Hatchetman serial murders case

was shot and killed
by police today

at an apartment building near
Sunset and LaBrea in Hollywood.

An anonymous source tells us

that although the perpetrator
was discovered in the apartment

of another young woman,

police are not convinced he
is the so called Hatchetman.

A city wide search continues
to find and question, this man,

Daniel Strong, an
ex-convict just release

from the State Penitentiary
three days ago.

Once again, if anyone
has information

regarding his whereabouts...

You want to fucking die, huh?!

-No no no no no no no no no.
-[gun clangs on counter]

Fucker!

Shit!

They're going after
the wrong guy.

I don't know.

Back home, there's this guy...

he kills his girlfriends entire
family just because she dumped him.

He didn't chopped
off their hands.

And I knew, Daniel, he
was a thug and a bully

but he wasn't a serial killer.

Daniel's only a suspect.

Claudia, who else?

He's the killer.

No.

No no no.

I'm getting out of here. I've

I'm going to call, Rob, and
I'm going to hook up with Curtis.

It's not a good idea.

You know, the killer
could still be out there.

Come on, Claudia, I've
