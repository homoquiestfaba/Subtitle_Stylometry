Timmy!

What?

Are you okay?

Just a dream.

Okay.

Becky!

I'm in a hurry.

Where did you pick up that nasty habit?

Timmy does it.

Ma, I don't do it when I sleep over

at other people's houses.

That's good.
I gotta go.

Breakfast!
I'm in a hurry!

What's her big rush?

Senior field trip.

Toast?

What's wrong?

I dreamed Timmy was here last night.

Yeah, I miss his calls too,

but he's got Carolyn now, okay?

Oh, it wasn't about missing him.

Faye, talk to me.

It was just an odd dream.

It shook me up, that's all.

I'm all right.

Just call him, you'll feel better.

I don't even know his number.

Did he tell you where he was staying?

Just someplace outside Chicago,

wherever the storm damage is the worst.

You know what?

I bet you he's in some fleabag motel

that doesn't even have a phone.

Well, call Carolyn.

I don't want to bother her.

Off to slay the dragon.

Bye.

Hello?

Carolyn.

Faye, how are you?

I'm fine.

It's Timmy I'm worried about.

He hasn't called us for weeks.

That's just not like him.

Have you heard from him?

I've been meaning to call you.

I've been upset about him also.

I haven't heard from him
since the day he left town.

That long ago?

Now I'm really worried.

Let's not panic.

I mean, it's Timmy.

He's probably just busy

and the phone lines are
still down since the storms.

Faye? Faye, are you still there?

Faye?

Faye, are you still there?

Don't forget
that blue ski sweater.

It's packed, Mom.
Along with my earmuffs.

Come on, you can't call me every morning

to check on my wardrobe.

Can she, Dad?

She just needs a little
time to get used to the idea.

On the other hand, I can't
wait to get rid of you.

Come on.

You know I think this is
gonna be a wonderful experience.

Big city, lots of opportunity,
being out on your own.

I'm your mother. I'm gonna miss you.

It's nice to hear.

Now, both of you get out.

It's still my room and I
need to finish packing.

Get out?

It's not a slum, Mom. It's great.

You're really gonna like it.

Two guys I met on a day
job helped me move in

and, oh!

I got a job from that ad I told you

I was putting in the newspaper.

Oh, that's terrific, honey.

Your dad's gonna be glad to hear all this.

I'm really glad that you
guys are happy with the house.

I think it's terrific.

I'm glad we were able to find something.

Could you stop that for a minute?

Sorry.

The leak is fixed.

My man's almost done here,

and of course the seller is
gonna pay for the repairs,

so it should be ready by...

Tomorrow.

Excellent.

Great.
That's great.

Thank you.
Okay, thanks so much.

Thank you very much.
Okay.

And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

Okay.
Bye-bye.

I want to thank you for
going that extra mile for me.

My clients are anal retentive

and if everything isn't
perfect, they whine.

What are you grinning at?

The way you talk, the way you look.

Makes a man smile.

Hey, do you want to go for a coffee?

Now that I'm finished, now
that I went that extra mile?

You look like you could
use a cold beer instead.

I haven't been to a place this
quaint since college days.

So Tim, if you own your own company,

what are you doing a little
patchwork job like mine for?

I don't own my own company.

I fake that in my ad. I'm a subcontractor.

I keep myself and two other guys busy.

But I got plans.

One of these days I'm
gonna own my own business.

Initiative. I like that in a man.

All I need is my contractor's license

and then I'm gonna slay the dragon.

That's what my dad calls it.

You know the real reason
that I took the job?

I flipped over your voice on the phone.

Do you know how to dance?

Closing time.

You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

Her name is Carolyn, Ma,
and I am crazy about her.

You just met her.

True, but that's all gonna change.

This time I just have this feeling.

That's what you said
about your last girlfriend.

And the one before that.

And Janet, and Judy before her.

At least Carolyn doesn't start with a J.

Cheap shot, Ma.

Look, she is smart and funny.

She owns her own business, real estate.

Okay, okay.

You convinced me. I give up.

Did I mention
she's beautiful?

No, really?

Hello?

Mother, hi.

No one's here.

No, I'm not out of breath.

Actually, stop.

No, I just got back from jogging.

Uh-huh.

My boyfriend, I mean my appointment.

No, I, I didn't say boyfriend, Mom.

No, actually I have, um, I have to go.

I have to go to my appointment.

Mom, I'm hanging up now.

Goodbye, Mother.

Why is it that the guys I hire

never live up to my expectations?

It wouldn't matter who
you had working for you.

You are a compulsive overachiever.

Well, I wish you'd get
your real estate license

and give up this paralegal thing.

And break my father's heart?

How is he?

He's losing weight again.

Jenny.

Doctors think he's not
in remission anymore.

I'm sorry.

Listen. I didn't want
to get all all gloomy.

So let's just change the subject.

Okay.

So how's your mystery man, hm?

So when am I gonna get
to meet this Timmy guy

who's been calling the
office for the past month?

You serious?

Well?

Oh, most of the guys I
date are yuppie narcissists.

But this guy is different.

It's 180 degrees.

He's the rough-hewn romantic type.

His hands are calloused

and he has a body that
would make you weep.

Tim has told me so much about you.

I can't wait to meet you.

Mrs. Dolan?

Faye. Call me Faye.

Since you can't come here,

I thought I would introduce
myself over the phone,

you know, because that
way when a woman answered

you wouldn't feel so-

Shocked.

Yeah. I know this is hard.

I mean, my mother feels the same way.

It's too soon, it's too soon.

But it's not like we're getting married.

We're just moving in together.

I mean, don't you think that's better?

So when you go on a date,
do you go in his pickup truck?

All dressed up?

Mother, would you tell him to stop?

All I'm doing is trying
to put two and two together.

I mean, if you're embarrassed-

You know, Kevin, when was the last time

that a woman even looked at you twice?

Stop it, both of you.

Get out of there, you're doing it wrong.

And stop picking at the caviar.

Kevin's right, you know.

I don't understand your
connection with this carpenter.

It's pheromonal.
What?

It's a chemical reaction, Mother.

Ha ha.

He is not your type.

Well, I've had the other type,

and they're not what
they're cracked up to be.

Tim makes me laugh.

And he's kind, and he's handsome,

and I don't care if he doesn't wear a tie.

Methinks she doth protest too much.

Your father and I did
not send you to college

and set you up in business
so that you could regress.

We taught you to set your sights higher.

What is with you people?

I'm not supposed to drink.

It's my liver.

You can feel it, here.

Hard as a rock.

So of course the missus
puts me on cocktail duty.

Where's the fairness in that, huh?

I guess it's not, sir.

You want me to take over?

No, no.

Martinis are my specialty.

Fish?
Pardon?

Do you fish?

No.

Golf?

Uh, sorry.

Well, what do you play?

I don't.

Work keeps me pretty busy.

Donald, Donald, Donald.

What is taking those martinis so long?

Is he talking your ear off?

No.

Just been chatting about
how much we have in common.

You've been drinking.

Has he been drinking?

You've been drinking all along.

Stop it.

Like a sneak.

Not in front of the company, Helen.

Don't you walk away from me!

I am not through with you!

How dare you!

Um, maybe we should go.

No, stay. They'll work it out.

Anyway, Mom's making duck.

You have to stay for the duck.

Mm-hm.

What are you thinking?

Nothing.

Come on, you're
thinking about something.

Okay.

It's your mother.

She hit him. Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

She lost it. You saw her.

I don't even know what
you're talking about.

I know what I saw.

I'm sorry.

I don't want to fight.

Honey, come on.

Stay away from me.

Carolyn, you don't have to just-

I said stop.

All I am saying is maybe your mother

needs some kind of help, you don't-

Where do you get off?

Carolyn!

Hey, don't walk away from me.

Can't you just listen to me for a second?

Let go.
Calm down.

Let go!

I'm sorry I hurt you.

I, uh, I made you mad.

I'm not like that.

I know.

I know.

I wanna make it up to you.

I'm gonna have a shiner
where your ring caught me.

Now why would you
say something like that

after I said I was sorry?

You don't understand the
pressure that I'm under.

My family, my business.

The pressure I put on myself.

Sometimes I feel like I'm carrying

the weight of the world on my shoulders.

And then when you held my hands,

I just, I just felt helpless,

and that's when I lost it.

Just tell me you love
me and it'll be all right.

I love you.

Come on, Tim.

Before it snows, all right?

All right, all right.

Take it.

What's going on?

You Timmy Dolan?
Yeah.

You won the lottery, man.

Your girlfriend sent this over.

Whether you want it or not, it's paid for.

All right. Thanks a lot.

Woo!

Looks like you're
into a pretty good thing

with this Carolyn, huh?

Yeah.

So what's up with the eye, Timmy?

How come you haven't told us?

I've got my own theory,
since he hasn't talked.

And what's that, Einstein?

Sex.

I mean, he's gotta be having wild sex

for us to begin this kind of attention.

It happened to me once.

I whacked my head on one of those knobs

on a brass headboard.

Come on, guys, knock it off.

We were just joking, Timmy.

I'm not paying you guys to be comedians.

That's the problem, Tim.

You're not paying us.

You know, I think he's right.

What's up with our checks?

Don't worry. You guys
are gonna get paid.

Come on, let's finish this up.

The contractor I was working for skipped.

I can't find him anywhere.

He owes me, and I have to pay my guys.

One of them has a kid.

I'll talk to your father.

A short-term loan,
and only if you can afford it.

Honey, why aren't you calling from home?

I didn't want Carolyn to get worried.

You're a couple now.

You're supposed to be able
to discuss things like this.

I know.

She'll think I can't keep my end up.

We've been discussing marriage.

Marriage?

Timmy, we haven't even met this girl.

Well then, come up
for the weekend. Visit.

I'd really like that, Mom.

Hey Jen, how are you?

Hey.

Carolyn's out showing a house.

What happened to you? Ran into a door?

As a matter of fact, I did.

I'm kind of clumsy myself.

So how's your father?

Yeah. Doctors can't do
anything else for him.

Hey, I didn't mean to get you all upset.

I, um, bought this for him.

You said he liked classical.

It's gonna work out.
You gotta believe, okay?

You gotta believe.

You think she's trying
to make a fool of me?

I mean, why'd she ask me to
come if she's gonna do this?

Well, she's just being Carolyn.

Just networking.

Who is that guy?

She's just talking, Timmy.

You didn't answer me.

He's a mortgage broker.

She's in real estate.

They do a lot of business together.

Looks like more than that.

He used to be her boyfriend.

And so, uh, you come
down there to see me.

Can we talk?

We have to go now.

I'm not going anywhere.

We have to pick up my
parents at the airport.

I don't have to do anything.

I'll meet you.

This is lovely.

Let me get that.

Yeah, thank you.

I'm so glad we're finally here.

It means a lot to us.

And what you've done
with this place is amazing.

What I want to know
is how you kept Tim here

from hanging his basketball hoop.

I put on a pot of coffee.

Tim knows where everything is.

I'm really sorry, but I have to rush off.

I have business at the office.

This late?

Goodnight.

Um, if you'll excuse me for a minute.

My parents came down to meet you.

I told them we were
talking about marriage.

Whatever. Give me the keys.

You're going out to meet that guy.

We work together. We
have business together.

Your mom said he's your ex-boyfriend.

Is he?

Give me the keys.

Talk to me!

Michael?

You better go down there and do something.

Just get away from me!

What is your problem?

Timmy! Stop it!

Stop it, son, stop it!

Now what is going on here?

This, this is embarrassing
for your mother and me.

Sorry, Mom.

Sorry.

Goodnight.

It smells awfully good in here.

Where's Dad?

Bacon and eggs, and your
dad's gone for a walk.

No time for breakfast, Ma.

Gotta see a man about some work.

You know, it's none of my business

what you were fighting about.

We're working it out, Faye.

When you get married,
you make a life commitment.

The stakes are higher.

Do you love my son?

I do, very much.

That's good, because
he deserves to be loved.

Sometimes he relies on others too much,

but he's a good man.

He'll find his way.

You worry about us too much.

You know, I wish that my mother
talked about me this way.

Stop it, you'll make me cry.

You're leaving tomorrow.

You know, I'm gonna take you shopping.

I know this wild shop that
Becky is just gonna love.

Oh my.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

We hope this brings you some luck.

It's gonna get better, Mom. Don't worry.

My work is good.

People are gonna see that.

I hate to see you struggling like this.

It's not fair.

Mom, come on. Don't spoil your visit.

I want you guys to go away feeling good.

I know you do.

Okay then, I guess I'll
just shut up.

Hey guys, let's go.

I'll call you soon as I get something.

It's good, it's good! It's good, yes!

Thank you, thank you!

Hi, honey.

Come have a seat.

Didn't you work today?

We got rained out.

It drizzled for five minutes.

Building's slow out there now.

Is it slow, or it got rained out?

Which one is it?

You could've fixed something for dinner.

Don't be upset.

I'll take you out.

With what?

It looks like I'm gonna have
to push you through your life.

Oh, very cruel.

When I met you, I
thought you had ambition.

I should have my head examined.

I'll make something, okay?

Dammit, I spent all day looking for work.

I don't wanna
hear any more excuses.

They're not excuses!

No, you take
money from your parents,

but you're living off me.

I've had it. I want you out of my life.

You scared the life out of me.

What are you doing here?

Why aren't you in Chicago?

Um, we had a fight.

We needed a break.

Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

No, it's okay.

You sure? You're all right?

Yeah.

Don't scare me like that.

I'm sorry.

I'll get you some fresh towels.

You have to tell me what happened.

Well, it's not Carolyn's fault.

It's mine. I keep screwing up.

She says I don't follow
through on anything.

You say the same thing.

And you're both right.

How'd you get those?
What?

Oh, at work.

I fell.

Hello?

Oh, hi.

Fine. Yeah. Yeah, he is.

Just a minute.

Hello?

Hey.

Tim?

Tim?

I was gonna phone you first.

Don't say anything.

And I got the idea watching the news.

They had a lot of damage upstate,

and they're gonna need crews for cleanup.

They're paying good money.

I don't want you to go.

You want an ambitious husband.

I'm gonna show you what I can do.

You don't need to do this.

My dad's gonna float me a loan

for chainsaws and equipment.

I can get Frankie and Dom to go

if I promise 'em the big bucks.

And then I just popped the
question and she said yes.

Listen, I'm really glad you could come.

It means a lot to Carolyn.

She wants us all to be a close family.

Hi!

Hi.
How are you?

Fine.

It's good to see you.

Can I get that?

I know you think we're completely crazy,

but we're doing the right thing.

Just before, I just got upset,

and I'm just completely
in love with your son

and I can't imagine going
through life without him.

Are we all ready?

Yeah.
Mom, after you.

Thank you.

I hope your flight was okay.

Fine.

Oh, we have so much
to do in so little time.

This afternoon I thought
we'd go to the hall,

and then tomorrow I made an
appointment at the bridal shop.

All this hurry.

Is there something I should know?

No Mom, she is not pregnant.

Close your eyes, close your eyes,

close your eyes, close your eyes!

To love.

Have a bite.

Oh, no no no,

I'll never be able to fit
into my wedding dress.

I'm gonna try.

Well, I thought I could
keep up with anybody,

but you two have worn me out.

Well, we got a lot done today.

You know what I wish?

That you could stay here longer with us.

Me too.

It's been terrific fun.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to the bathroom.

I'll be right back.

Ask me anything.

Have you settled your differences?

Are you fighting?

It's not like that, okay, Mom?

I know we're gonna make it.

You sure look happy.

We are.

I love you, Mom.

Timmy.

I was loading up equipment.

I would have changed, except
Carolyn said "Don't be late."

I loved meeting your mother today.

She likes you too, Mrs. Blair.

A wedding guest list is
a very important thing.

Who's winning?
I am.

Oh, why am I not surprised?

You're late.

What is he doing here?

Well, he's Kevin's friend too. Be nice.

Be nice to him?

I don't get it.

Guest list, wedding, family.

Am I missing something here?

I don't want to talk about this now.

This was supposed to be fun.

Carolyn.
Don't.

Come on, everybody.

Let's go into the dining room
and we'll start the list.

We'll talk about this later.

Carolyn, how could you bring him?

Don't you tell me
who I can have in my house.

Who the hell do you think you are?

I'm the guy you're about to marry!

Oh, so that
just gives you the right

to tell me what to do?

I'm so sick of this.

What is your problem?
I can't stand you!

I hate you!

Hey.

She's not here.

Yeah, I knew that.

Jen, could you do me a favor
and give this to Carolyn?

I just got word where emergency
crews are supposed to meet.

She'll be back in any minute.

I'm sure she'd like to see you.

No, no. That's not a good idea.

You want to talk about it?

Just tell her if she needs to reach me

that that's the first
town we'll be stopping in.

What's up?

Gave my notice.

I don't know how long my
father has, and he needs me.

I don't think I'll be
back for a while, so.

Good luck.

Thanks.

Let's go! Slow, slow, that's good.

Looking good. Watch
that engine over there.

Watch it.

All right, let's finish this
up and go get some lunch.

So am I gonna see you tonight?

You swear you're not married?

Oh, you got me confused
with my partner over there.

See, he's the one who's engaged.

Tonight. I'll be at Johnny B's.

All right.

Hey, come on inside.

She's got a nice girlfriend.

Keep 'em away.

Aw, come on.

I thought we came out to party.

I got a problem.

Yeah. Yeah, you do.

Your problem is since we've been here,

you've been in a funk.

With Carolyn.

What, cold feet?

Second thoughts.

Well, have you tried calling
her since we've been here?

No. We had a knock-down drag-out, man.

I can't take it anymore.

For the first time in my life,
I'm seeing things clearly.

Carolyn has it all.

Beauty, brains, personality.

Unfortunately, she also has
the temper of a serial killer.

It's over.

I have to tell her.

I'm in the relationship from hell.

Good luck, man.

Yeah, thanks.

Missing persons?

Yeah, okay. Hold on, I'll transfer.

Jack?
What's up?

You know that woman
who's been calling in

that missing persons report from Hartford?

Yeah.

Yeah, well, she isn't
in Hartford anymore.

Mrs. Dolan?

Hello, Mrs. Dolan.
I'm Detective Jack Maas.

We spoke on the phone, I believe.

I'm here about my son.

You understand, Mrs. Dolan,

that it isn't against the law
for an adult to disappear.

Oh, not Timmy.

He'd call. He always calls.

You said he was working
the storm cleanup.

Now, the phone lines are still
down in a lot of that area.

He'd find a way.

Have you checked with his girlfriend?

She's his fiance.

And as I told you on the phone,

she hasn't heard from him either.

Well, think about it, Mrs. Dolan.

A young guy, probably got
a pocket full of money,

sowing some wild notes before the wedding.

Timmy wouldn't do that.

Look, there's
not a lot I can do here.

Not without some signs of foul play.

Now, I'm sorry you had to make the trip.

You couldn't be more wrong about my son.

That's Timmy.

Faye.

I hope I'm not bothering you.

Come in.

When did you get here?

I came to fill out a missing
persons report on Timmy.

You can't do that from out of state.

Well, where's Michael?

He had to work, and somebody
had to stay with Becky.

Oh, Carolyn.

I'm afraid something
really awful has happened.

Now you're making me nervous.

The police were no help at all.

I don't know what to do.

I keep having this dream.

I need to know where he is.

That he's all right.

I need answers.

He'll show up.

We have to believe that.

Now, where are your things?

At the hotel.

Well, we're gonna get
them. You're staying here.

Oh no, I couldn't.

You're staying here
for as long as you need.

Thank you.

The body come with that?

No, sir.

Did you sleep okay last night?

No.

Oh, the bed was fine.

Thank you, it's...

I haven't had a good night's sleep

for a couple of weeks now.

Did you take anything?

No.

What?

Something's different.

Oh, I changed the furniture.

I thought I was losing my mind.

I didn't even notice it last night.

Well, it was dark. And you were upset.

You got new carpet too.

Oh, they were having
this incredible sale

and I couldn't resist.

So what's your plan?

About Timmy?

Carolyn, what's going on here?

You're redecorating?

You're going about your
life as if nothing happened?

Timmy is missing.

You never even reported it to the police.

This is really hard for me to say.

We broke up.

You promise me that you won't
hate me for telling you this?

Tim got physical with me.

We had a fight,

and that's when he left
for the storm cleanup.

And until you had called,
I thought he had told you.

I was so embarrassed.

I just, he left some things here,

and I just assumed that
he would come back.

I'm sorry.

Shh.

You really should have
come to us sooner, Faye.

I know that things haven't
always been so great

between our children.
Mother.

I already told her that we fought.

Let's just leave it at that.

Their breakup was...

Well, acrimonious.

So tell me, Faye.

What did you accomplish today?

Unfortunately, nothing.

I had to show houses today.

So she was stuck in the condo.

Maybe Carolyn could make
a list of Timmy's friends.

You know his friends.

Well, I don't know a lot of them,

but I know some of them.

I could do that.

There, you see? A plan.

Okay. You're gonna need one of these.

Do you have your bus schedule?

Fine.

I'm sorry that I can't do it.

I understand. Go see your client.

Um, dinner tonight. Cafe Terminus.

Okay.

Seven o'clock?

Excuse me.

Would you know a Dominic Santos?

Hey, Dominic!
Yo!

Thanks, Dominic.
You can call me Dom.

Everybody does.

You call me Dominic,

it's like I'm automatically
in trouble with my mom.

Okay, Dom.

Sorry to bother you here at work,

but we're at our wits' end.

Cool. Listen.

I like Timmy, but I haven't seen him.

And if I have, I would've told you.

'Cause if it was me, I wouldn't
want my mom all freaked.

Um, Timmy left town with
some guy to work the storm?

You know anything about that?

Who the guy is?

That'd be, um, Frankie.

Frankie, I don't know his last name.

Where would I find this Frankie?

You can't.

You know what you said about your mom?

I'm starting to freak.

This is the number where I'm staying.

Please help me try to find Frankie.

Call me.

Thanks, Dom.

Faye.

I can't sell anything.

And another salesman left me today.

I'm sorry.

How was your day? Did
you find anything out?

I took four buses.

I know Chicago better than the drivers.

And I only found one of Timmy's friends.

If you send enough
positive energy out there,

it'll happen.

I know that.

When that little son
of a bitch calls me,

I'm gonna give him holy hell.

He would've called me
if he was going away.

We're that close.

Tim and I used
to play Frisbee over there.

You said used to, as if Timmy was gone.

I meant used to as in we
used to have a relationship.

I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry.

It's okay.

What was your last fight about?

The same fight we
had in the parking lot.

Did you say he got violent?

I don't want to talk about this.

I need to know.

Tim and I were having problems.

I started to see my ex-boyfriend.

While you were still with Timmy?

I know.

When Tim found out, he got crazy.

Faye, I, you don't want to hear this.

I do.

He pulled my hair and
he tried to put my face

down on the burner of the stove.

What are you talking about?

That's not my son.

Yeah?

Hello? Faye?

I can't sleep.

How are you holding up?

Okay.

Any luck at all today?

No. How's Becky? Is she all right?

Oh yeah, yeah. Becky's fine.

And school's fine, work's fine.

What's the trouble, Faye?

I can't sleep.

Dreams?

Uh-huh.

It's very difficult.

It's about Timmy being violent.

I told the detective that they broke up.

I don't understand why
he hasn't called me.

Well, maybe
he's just so embarrassed

about what happened with Carolyn.

Is she being helpful?

She's giving me
as much time as she can.

She has a business to run.

The numbers match on the truck, Faye.

If you're up to it,

I'd like you to come down
to the impoundment yard

and complete the identification for me.

Oh God.

She's not. I'll go.

No, I, I have to see the truck.

It's the closest I've
been able to get to him

since he disappeared.

Why is the paint scraped off?

Same reason the license
tags were removed.

Whoever did it was trying to
make it harder to identify.

So what are you telling me?

Can I be straight with you?

Somebody stole it for parts,
the parts would be gone.

Somebody stole it for a joyride,

I don't think they'd
bother with paint removal.

Something happened to Timmy.

Well, I'm not ready to
make that leap yet, Faye.

Let's just say your son's
case has got my attention.

Isn't there anything
more you can tell us?

I'm afraid not.

Of course, we'd know a lot more

if it hadn't been sitting in
the water for three weeks.

What do you do now?

And finally, an update
on that pickup truck

that was recovered from a
shipping channel in Lake Michigan.

The truck has been traced
to a Timothy Dolan,

who has been missing from the
Chicago area for three weeks.

Anyone with knowledge of his whereabouts

should contact the police
department immediately.

I thought it best if we
talked away from Mrs. Dolan.

Well, last time I saw
Tim Dolan, we had a fight.

He left, he said he had
some work clearing trees.

You going somewhere?

Well, I had to let go of my salesman.

He didn't produce.

And my secretary had to
take care of her father.

This place is simply too big for me.

Did Jimmy have any enemies?

Did?

Did, does, you get the gist.

No.

I mean, I don't know.

I mean, we traveled in different circles.

I don't know if he had any enemies.

Drugs?

Alcohol, if you count that.

Would you have known if he
was doing drugs on the sly?

What are you implying?

That he had some kind of secret life?

Did or does?

Never mind.

Was he ever violent with people?

With you?

Do you get off on this?

He beat me.

Where are you?

Hello?

Carolyn?

Uh, no, this is-

Hello?

Who is this?

This is Dom.

Mrs. Dolan?

Dom, yes.

You gave me this number
in case I could get in touch

with the guy Timmy went out of town with.

All right, the
only reason I'm talking to you

is because I like Timmy, okay?

Please tell me where he is.

Beats me.

We came back three weeks
ago, and that's all I know.

We were supposed to head
out a couple days later,

but Timmy never picked me up.

Three weeks ago?

Yeah, I know it was around then

because I had to come here
to see my parole officer.

And Timmy was coming back to
break up with his girlfriend.

Said he finally had a plan
to put his life together.

Go figure.

He saw Carolyn?

Well, like I say, he dropped me off.

Why don't I believe you?

All right, I'll tell you what.

We got a ticket on the way back.

You check it out with the cops, all right?

Carolyn said Timmy was violent with her.

Was he?

No, man, it was just the opposite.

Y'see, he told me a lot about her.

He always had bruises and stuff.

Hell, I even seen her go off on him

in the parking lot outside.

She was punching him
through the car window

and he was just standing there taking it.

The police should know about this.

Will you come with me?

No, ma'am, I'm sorry.

If my parole officer found that
I violated by leaving town,

I'm back in prison.

I'm sorry.

What's going on?

Why did you lie to me

about Timmy coming back three weeks ago?

I didn't.

I talked to Frankie.

He said Timmy came back
to break up with you.

He's lying.

And did he lie when he said
you were the violent one?

Frankie is a drug addict

who wouldn't remember three weeks ago

any more than he would
remember three minutes ago.

I believe him.

Who are you calling? The police?

I was calling a cab.

I got it.

The 5th of March.

Mrs. Blair, Mr. Blair, I'm
sorry for the interruption.

It's come to our attention
through a traffic ticket

that Tim Dolan was in
town on the 5th of March.

Did you see him?

No.

To your knowledge, did
your daughter see him?

No.

Look, Sergeant-
Detective.

Don't you think it's strange
that Tim would return

and not see your daughter?

I don't think I like the
innuendo I'm hearing, Detective.

Excuse me.

So the morgue search turns up nothing.

The contacts in the
area turned up nothing.

Nobody saw the guy when he
got back, except Frankie.

Try this on.

The guy left with Dolan, right?

Well, maybe Dolan came
back with a wad of cash

and Frankie the ex-con did him.

A mind is a terrible thing.

What'd they say?

They were indignant.

I'm sure they were.

You remember, you told me if
I thought of anything else?

Well, Carolyn just got some
furniture and a new rug.

Maybe I'm missing something here.

Detective Grant's desk.

But there was nothing
wrong with the old furniture.

It looked brand new.

Jack, line two.
Tell them I'm busy.

I'll call back.

You better take this one.

Detective Maas.

I may have some
information about Timothy Dolan.

Would you mind if we asked you

a couple more questions, Miss Blair?

No. I'd love to help
in any way possible.

Come in.

How would you characterize

your relationship with Tim?

I told you, we were engaged.

Yes, but you also told me
that you hadn't seen him.

But you see, I have
information that he returned.

I also told you that we broke up.

Miss Blair, were you ever
violent with Tim Dolan?

No, it was the other way around.

What's he doing?

What's he doing?

Just looking around, Miss Blair.

That's all right, isn't it?

This isn't legal.

You invited us in.

I really think it's best if you leave.

If you want to change your story,

get something off your chest, my number.

So what do you got?

Several spots show traces of blood.

Faye, I thought I asked
you to wait downtown.

What's going on? What did you find out?

Let's talk about it downtown, Faye.

Why talk downtown? Is Carolyn here?

We believe Tammy
was the victim of foul play.

She killed him.

I knew it!

I've already cried myself out

and had an episode with my suitcase.

It's driving me crazy.

Michael, I stayed in the
place where she killed him.

You don't know that, Faye.

The police found
blood in Carolyn's apartment.

But it doesn't mean
anything till they test it.

Then why wouldn't
they let me go back in?

I don't know, Faye. I don't know.

This is beginning to look very bad.

I feel so lost.

Son of a bitch, Faye.

I can't stay down here any longer.

I'm getting on a plane.

Oh, what about Becky?

Don't worry about Becky.

I'll have my sister stay with her.

Soon?
Yes, soon.

I love you.

I've done my duty. I came forward.

We need to hear her incriminate herself.

Will you wear a wire?

I don't want to be around her.

I think she may be a killer.

That frightens the hell out of me.

I need to get Carolyn on
tape for a search warrant.

Help us out here.

Can you force me to?

Can I talk to her for a minute, alone?

You know what I was
thinking about out there?

For most of my adult life, I've had a son.

I was 18 when I got married.

You know how old Timmy was?

26.

Try to imagine the emptiness I feel.

He was a good boy.

You know how good he was.

He told me about your father's illness.

He died.

That's why I didn't come sooner.

I'm sorry.

Timmy brought me presents for him.

CDs, book ones.

You know death now, Jenny.

We both do.

We both know how final it is.

You think that Carolyn Blair
took Timmy away from us.

You told the police that much.

Jenny, if this evil goes unpunished,

we'll never feel anything but emptiness.

Please.

I'd like to arrange a secure phone call

between you and Carolyn's parents.

I believe they may have
knowledge of the crime.

What else don't I know?

Faye, we're working on
a good relationship here.

Let's not spoil it.

Need to know. We agreed.

I think it's time we put some
pressure on these people.

Mrs. Blair, this is Faye Dolan.

Are you doing all right, Faye?

Carolyn told us that you
and she had a falling out.

A falling out?

I can't tell you how
difficult this call is.

The police think Timmy is dead.

Dead?

Oh, I'm so sorry.

We'll pray for you. Is there
anything that we can do?

They also think Carolyn was involved.

Of course, that's preposterous.

I think she was involved too.

I'm sorry that you feel that way.

We'll pray for you.

Hi.
Hi.

Hi.

Hi, hi, hi.

Oh, sit.

The cops have been
calling every relationship

and every friend that I've ever had.

The doctor has been prescribing sedatives.

They're not helping.

I don't deserve this.

And the worst part was,

is that I knew whatever
Timmy set his mind to,

he would fail.

Why couldn't I just walk away?

When Tim was good, he was marvelous.

How's that nursery rhyme go?

And when he was bad, he made
me lose control.

Talk to me.

You'll feel better.

Can't do that.

You can.

Carolyn.

Tell me what happened.

Carolyn.

Tim had only been gone a week

when he just showed up one night.

What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be out working.

I came back for my things.

You're leaving?

Just let me get my things.
I've made up my mind.

I'm going to do this.

Don't you walk away from me!

What is more important, me or your stuff?

Hey!

I don't want to hurt you.

I don't even know if it will hurt you,

but I have to take
responsibility for myself.

Oh, so you found someone?

I didn't find anybody.

You lying son of a bitch!

You need help.

And it's the kind I can't provide.

I don't want to fight anymore, Carolyn.

Ever.

I don't have the energy.

Why?

Mom! Dad!

Get up! Please get up!

Open the door!
What's going on?

I didn't mean to do
it. It was an accident.

You have to do something!
What's going on?

You're all white, you're all white.

He's dead.

Tim is dead.

Let's get you cleaned up.
We'll see if you're all right.

Call Kevin, get him over here right now.

Now!

When we got there,

Tim had crawled into the living room.

I guess he was trying to reach the phone.

He's still alive.

No!

Did this happen the way you said it did?

No.

Helen?

Do you want her to go to jail?

My parents have a
house on Lake Michigan.

They keep a boat there.

They took him out of sight
of land, and dumped him.

Carolyn.

His worst sin was that he let you down.

Ma'am, you're not allowed in here.

This is my house.

We have a search warrant.

Would you tear up the carpet?

I want a test done for blood
in the kitchen, on that wall.

If I back you up all the way,

would you cut me some slack on this one?

Faye and Michael Dolan.

I'd like to introduce Paul Blackwell

with the state attorney's office.

Right.

Detective Maas should have told you.

We don't have a body,
we don't have a case.

Matter of fact, we don't
even have a weapon.

What we do have is Carolyn
on tape, in her own words.

We can prove Timmy was in town

because of the traffic ticket he got.

The blood in the condo is his, no doubt.

He lived there, he could've cut himself.

Oh, that's a load of
bull and you know it.

Well, that's gonna be her
defense and you know it.

Translation?

It doesn't look good on
their win-loss record

come election time.

Jurors in this county don't
give out guilty verdicts

without hard evidence.

Well, what he's trying to tell you is

that his office has had, what,

one murder conviction on
circumstantial evidence

in the past two years?

Fine, since you brought it up,

what happens if a body does
show up after she's acquitted?

She skates.

Let the grand jury decide that.

That body has a name.

Timothy Michael Dolan.

Of course.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

I don't know anything
about rules of evidence,

as you call them, but I do know one thing.

This is as close as we're ever gonna get.

Mrs. Dolan, do you understand
what double jeopardy is?

I don't give a damn
about double jeopardy.

We want justice!

If this drags on and these people

are allowed to believe
they got away with it,

what happens next?

What happens the next time
Carolyn is mad at her boyfriend,

or God forbid someday her child?

Do something.

Becky.

I'm so glad, I'm so glad you're here.

Oh, my darling.

How was your flight?

It was good.

How's it going in there?

Well, we don't know yet.

The attorneys are just

presenting the evidence to the grand jury.

Why don't they just arrest them?

This is the only way
they can get the Blairs

to trial without Timmy's body.

Have they called you yet?

Yeah, both of us.

I did it.

Thank you, Jen.

This is our daughter, Becky.

Hi.
Hi.

A friend of mine called
from the courthouse.

The grand jury is meeting as we speak.

If they indict Carolyn with the murder

and disposal of the body,

that negates my ability to use
self-defense as a strategy,

you have to know that.

What are you telling me?

Killing him to protect
herself is one thing,

but not calling the cops,
not doing the right thing,

how am I gonna explain that to a jury?

You're gonna have to step up

and admit to the dumping of the body

or there's a good chance
she's gonna do big time.

What could they have?

Your daughter on tape.

They can place the Dolan kid,

and they have good blood evidence.

You people didn't do a very good job

of cleaning up after yourselves.

Well, you'll have to excuse me.

I'm a little rusty at murder scenes.

I've come for your daughter, Mrs. Blair.

The grand jury has indicted you

for the murder of Timothy Michael Dolan.

Carolyn Blair, you are under arrest.

Can I bring her
downtown with our lawyer?

No, but I can't stop you

from following us to headquarters.

Before we ask you any questions,

you must understand your rights.

You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can be used against you

in the court of law.

You took me into your home.

You behaved like a daughter to me.

And all the while you
and your loving family

knew my son was the bottom of the lake.

You took away a good, loving boy.

You took him away when he
was just beginning to live.

Well, I think this will be good.

Stop the boat, please.

Yes, sir.

You okay, Faye?

As all right as I'm gonna be.

Tell me we did right by him.

We raised our child to be
good and caring, to love life.

That's all any parent can do.

That's all you could've done.

Sweetheart, it's okay.

I love you, Timmy.

Tim.
