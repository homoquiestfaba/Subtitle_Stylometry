As a doctor ...

The most regretful thing could be
when the one you care for most

Has physical problems ...

And there's nothing you can do about it

This experience can be very terrible

S he once said

S he wished l would be a brilliant doctor

lf l weren't in the past, l must be in future

Now this is the thing ...

That l can still do for her

S he left all of a sudden

So sudden ... when you think of it later ...

You can still feel the pain

lf anyone wants to know ...

How the pain feels

l can tell them

lt's best you don't ever have a chance
to know

One more round?

That's enough for tonight

You are on dirty jokes every time

S he's been staring at you all night

Did you really not notice
or are you just pretending?

Okay?

May be l'm not

Please give me a glass of water

ls the pager yours?

Yes, thank you

Thanks

You really don't want another glass?

No

Bye Bye

Are you okay?

My neck got hurt

l am a doctor. l'll sent you to the hospital
right now

What's up in the ER?

Police-gangster gun fight, serious

There's a cop upstairs waiting for you
to do surgery

There are two cops in there
we're trying to save

Thank you

He always thought

l was responsible for ...

The death of his brother

Up till now, l still couldn't make him
understand

Sometimes what a doctor can do
is very limited

l've found the bullet

l heard you were in a car accident
just now

Again it's heavy rain

And a driver who is hit-and-run

What's different is that this time
l did not die

The most important thing is
that you are safe

What about the car? Need to replace it?

What's the fun about it?

l don't understand what's so exciting

lt's human life!

lt's your own business if you want
to kill yourself

Why get others into trouble too?

Everything in life seems to
remain unchanged

The books and magazines she ordered

Are still delivered at the right time

The cat she took care of

Although it had run away

lt still appear before me sometimes

The most incomprehensible difference
could be ...

When she was beside me in the past,
l would dream of her

After she's gone

She never appeared in my dream

Mandy?

Are you looking for Tse Yuen-han?

You must have long ...

The phone call the other night

May be she wanted me to know

l could have understood her a bit more

Dr Ching

Tak

lt was such big trouble last night,
if you weren't around

We'd have a headache

Did you see Dr Fong?

He's left, didn't he tell you?

No

Right, Dr Fong asked me to tell you

lf it's convenient for you, can you
lend me a thousand dollars

Bye

Yes

l'm at the bank now

You call me when you are done

Okay, bye

What a coincidence!

Excuse me ...

The bank is closed

Are you busy?

Not too busy

lt's happy even if it is busy
in the delivery room

Yes

S ir, please queue up here

What? Do l have to queue up to rob?

Freeze!

lf you shoot, l'll kill her!

Put the gun down! Put it down!

Put the gun down! Put it down!

Come here! Come here quick!

Give me all the money!

Who is it? Who pressed the alarm?
Come out!

Come out!

Go over! Go over!

Who? Who ...

Buddy, it's like this, don't be nervous ...

lf you rob, someone would press
the alarm

l'm not afraid of them!

You just shut up

l'll finish all of you!

The thinner is very dangerous,
don't do anything silly!

You can't light it!

Please stay calm!

Everyone stay calm! Don't run around!

The door is locked, what shall we do?

Everyone move away!

S lowly, don't be nervous

Hold on, l'll ask my colleague to help

Thank you

S it here for a while

Karen

Are you okay?

l'm fine

Can you come here to help

Don't worry, my colleague will help you

You are hurt too

l'm fine

You take care of her

Relax your feet, right

Give way ...

Don't worry, it'll be fine, hold on

Paul!

Are you okay?

Why are you here?

l heard there was trouble at the bank
you went to

l was worried you might be sent to ER

So l came over to see

l'm a good guy, l'll be alright

S ince you are here, why don't you help

Do you need to tell me?

The people here are all conscious?

Everyone don't panic

Miss ...

Someone here has crashed! Help!

Take to Room 3!

You're here too?

Don't ask now

1 ,2,3 !

Give way ...

Be careful, mister!

Go away! Give way ...

Sandy, drip!

Miss, hold out!

Need help?

Cut the crap, move!

Doctor, the one just sent in is a suspect

We need to keep custody of him

We don't care who he is,
our duty is to save people

We don't care what you do,
just don't interfere with our work

What's the BP? How is he doing?

BP 90/50, pulse 1 42, SAO2 76

Traver 8.5, get the machine ready

TlDE volume 500cc, Peep 6, Rate 1 2

The larynx is swelling,
tracheotomy needed

Scalpel

Trachea-dilator

Trachea-tube

Okay, connect to machine

BP 90/50, pulse 1 30, SAO2 92

Send to lCU

How's he doing?

Just did an ultrasound. The baby's gone

Her family is outside,
we haven't told them yet

Take her to the lCU

Checked with lCU, they have only one
bedspace left

Who shall we send first?

This woman

How about taking a bath first?

S ure

Thereafter would you drive me home?

No problem

Give me some time

What do you want?

So much has happened, l need to talk to
a friend

A girl friend is a girl friend, friend?

Get to the point

Just a little while, it'll be quick

Wait and see. A few days later

l'll show you some of my childhood
photos

And you'll know how l different
look now

You plan to chat with your girl friend
through to dawn, right?

l'm leaving

No, we're almost through

l don't want to disturb your rest

lt's you who needs a rest, you still
need to come back for surgery

lt's morning

Yes

l'd better go

What are you up to?

Don't you get bored listening to the
same song over and over?

Everyone who sits in my car say that

lt must be your problem,
or people wouldn't say that

What's my problem?

lt's no different from playing with
the same toy

Please pay a little respect

Human feelings need to be exchanged,
do you understand?

We do interchange feelings!

l don't understand what you are up to

Wasting your time and effort doing
something which leads to nowhere

So long as l am happy

who cares if it leads to nowhere

Only you are happy now

Do you think she is happy?

S he will be, we exchange feelings

l also hope she can live like a
normal person

There are lots of things which we don't
get even if we want to

Dr Ching, you're here to visit
Mrs Cheung again?

Yes

Her things are still here

Yes, we have looked everywhere

What should we do?

What happened to Mrs Cheung?

Dr Ching, can we talk outside?

Do you know where Mrs Cheung is now?

Of course l don't, haven't you been
looking for her?

S he had been very depressed earlier

S he even goes around saying she wants
to commit suicide

S hould we consider calling the police?

S he is depressed because of you,
Dr Ching

What has it got to do with me?

Because you told her that she has
a tumor in her brain

and only has two more years to live

l did say that

But as a doctor, l have a duty ...

to let a patient know of her situation

Doesn't your conscience feel bad?

What if she commits suicide because of
what you said?

l think you should call the police first

Nurse S hek, Dr Ching, they found
Mrs Cheung

She is on the roof-top

What shall we do now?

You talk to her first

Mrs Cheung

Don't come over

l am going to die, why are you still
bothering me?

Don't be so agitated

Everyone in the hospital wants to
help you

There's nothing that can't be resolved,
right?

How can it be resolved?

l have cancer

And see how my husband treats me now

There's no one to look after the child
after he's born

What's there left to live for?

Nowadays cancer is not incurable

Why lose hope so soon?

lt's you doctors who told me that!

Don't bother me!

You come closer and l'll jump!

Don't!

Go away!

Okay ...

Don't be agitated

We'll move away

Don't come over!

Don't come over ...

You come over and l'll jump!

Calm down ...

Don't come over!

Don't be so tense, l just want to train
my guts in this good weather

l'm more scared than you are

Don't come over!

Okay ... don't move ...

l'm not moving

Normally l wouldn't choose a place
like this to chat

l'll give in to you today

You told me l have brain cancer ...

and l only have two more years at most

Now you tell me that l can be cured?

You just say whatever you like!

We are not driveling

We are telling the truth

Do you still remember?

The other day l told you the worst result

but it may not happen

My husband is afraid l might get cancer

He left with another woman

He will know about your illness sooner
or later

lf he doesn't support you

he doesn't deserve to be your husband

Why should you do such a silly thing
because of him?

What about my child then?

Who would take care of him after
he's born?

lf you have recovered, you can
take care of him

You told me l would die

Do you believe so much in what l say?

What if l tell you that the tumor
in your brain ...

may not be that desperate?

What l said the other day, is so that you
would not be like other people ...

Who die before they have time to do
something for the people they care

Can l really be cured?

My legs really feel a bit weak chatting
like this

Why don't we go inside first?

Come escort Mrs Cheung to her room
quick

Count yourself lucky this time

As a doctor, please be careful with
what you say to your patients

Just now it was me who persuaded her
to come back

Talking to you is a waste of my time!

Kelvin is coming up to find me

You must remember

You haven't seen me

Where's Dr Ching?

We haven't seen him

Then call him immediately!

This is crazy! What does he think
he is doing?

Sorry for interrupting

l'll be leaving soon

Paul often tell me ...

That you can hear what he says

And can communicate with him

l have some reservations about this

l know, what doctors can do ...

can be very limited sometimes

We have all worked hard during this time

Still she hasn't improved

So l pray for her everyday

May be that's the only thing
we can do for her

Don't laugh, miracles sometimes
happen that way

l won't disturb your sleep

Paul!

Your girl friend just woke up!

What?

Your girl friend is awake,
she regained consciousness

How could that happen?

l don't know. May be it's a miracle

Let's not talk, and go to see her

Congratulations!

This time you waited till she wakes

You should buy us a meal

Right, we should celebrate

We need to have a few tables

Everyone in the hospital is happy for you

lf won't be enough if you don't have
a few tables

This time girlfriend really becomes
your girlfriend

You have to treat her well in future

ls it my turn yet?

What else have you to say?

l'll look for a place

l'll arrange the menu

That's settled

Where shall we go?

You're coming too?

What about your girlfriend?

ln good condition

l don't mean physically, l mean
emotionally

Well ... not bad

Wake up, press the button

You won't get up by tomorrow
if you just stand here

l was just about to press

People who are easily satisfied are
the most happy

S uch kind of relationship, which starts
from wishful thinking

Could have such a happy ending

Hello. Hi

Busy? Haven't seen you all day

You have to take care of someone,
so l took over your place

lt's lunch

l went to visit her in physiotherapy
and then drove her here

Did you wake me up?

l don't think l need to introduce

Can you tell me honestly

what did you do to me the other day
in my room?

Paul know me very well

l ...

l can do anything, so ...

Think yourself

Lawrence loves to make jokes in front of
old friends

Gotta get back to work

Bye

Why are you here?

Don't ask

You can't just run away like this

Paul will be worried

Please, l'll have these

You listen to me first

You listen to me ...

Did you drive?

Can you drive me to the cemetery?

l feel comfortable here at the cemetery

l have a friend buried here too

Why didn't you go and say hello to him
just now?

Can we go back now?

Today is the anniversary of
my grandma's death

l thought l should come and see her

Who are you calling?

l am calling Paul to tell him
what happened

l know you care about me

But l need some privacy too

Can you give me a little time ...

So l can do what l want?

lt's not that l don't let you have
your private time

lt's not right to sneak out

Can you give me back my mobile phone?

Let's go

Health is really very important

To be honest, the food in your hospital ...

ls terrible

That's about all for today?

Have l given you trouble?

Someone is worried about you

Did you regret waking me?

You really think it has to do with me?

l presume it has

Without you, l wouldn't have today

l'm not the one who's helped the most

Let's go

Tell me honestly

did you do anything to my brain?

What do you mean?

lt's very complicated, l can't get it right

l just feel that l wasn't like that before

But if l really am different from my past

l shouldn't feel like l have changed myself

Do you understand what l'm saying?

To make it simpler ...

What were you like before?

See that girl over there?

l was like her in the past

Where are we going?

l only know l have to take you back
to the hospital

How can someone drive like that?

What are you doing?

That driver could be my buddy

l don't get it

Stop playing!

l'm not playing with him

l want to see who kill my girl friend

Take a rest

l said it before

That's the end of your car

l'm sorry

lt's lucky l am not marred

Or l won't let you get away with it

They are arranging for you to do
a CT-brain

Not again?

Only Paul knows how to handle you

You take a rest first

This time l brought you good luck

Next time don't act on impulse again

Dr Ching, l heard you hit your car again

l'm not in a good mood today!

Don't make me angry of l won't be
easy on you!

You hear that?

Doctors can be in a bad mood too

Learn from others when you have time

l believe in retribution, it's just that
the time hasn't come

Don't stretch yourself too much, it's hard

What are you doing here?

Working

Can you disclose?

A relative of one of our patients here ...

#NAME?

You think they have a case?

The deceased is the robber in the bank
arson case

They want to sue the doctors here
for discriminating against him

S uch that he did not receive
proper treatment ...

#NAME?

Would we?

l won't interrupt you,
l'll call later for lunch

Okay

You know each other?

Yes, bye

Miss Tsien, please come to my office
to talk

Okay

Kelvin is looking for you, he wants to
see you

He must want to talk about
the suicide incident

Tell him l don't have time

l told him already, but he is coming up
now

Then say l am not here

How can l say that? You are here

Can't l just not be here immediately!
Christina!

As you wish

Kelvin!

Just want to find you,
you're looking for me?

Please come in

Okay

l want to talk to you about something

That fire at the bank, you helped
saving people, didn't you?

Not only me, a lot of people helped

S .Y. ... he is in trouble this time

What trouble?

One of the patients died and wants to
affix responsibility

How can l help?

l want to know more about
the situation that day

Will you help him?

Anyway l believe him,
l'm sure he can pay

He's a friend

Okay

Worst come to worst, you just pay

lt's nothing

Doctors can be a high risk business

lt seems that the risk of a patient is higher?

How can you say that?

l won't argue with you, l'll be more
worried if l win

Hi, haven't seen you for a long time

Hello

You know Anthony?

Hello

Hello

We haven't been formally introduced

l won't disturb you, let's have lunch
when we have time

Okay

He is not a good guy

That Anthony is a triad member

Really can't tell from his looks

So you can also be very hypocritical

Look!

Are you fishing or feeding the fish?

That's not where the fun is

The most important thing is to enjoy
the process

lt's like drinking and not be drunk

Playing mahjong and not winning

Courting a girl and not having sex
with her?

You really know how to console yourself

What else can l do?

S he said to me

Thanked me for taking care of her
these days

But ...

That nothing can happen between us

S he's right

lt's just my wild fantasy

What are you doing here early
in the morning?

Looking for a place to live

Here?

lt can't be

S houldn't be a problem, right?

Would it be inconvenient?

There's no other way, the rent is cheap

How long are you planning to stay?

Until l find a job

l think l can still survive a week

Why don't l help you look for
a decent hotel?

Would you pay for me first?

No problem, you can pay me back
when you find a job

Thanks in advance

But l'm not used to borrowing money
from someone l don't know too well

So what do you want?

l am okay

Bye

Now what?

You're right, it's really not that
convenient here

Well, if you really want to help me

can you find me a place which is
free of charge?

l just need a place to take a bath
and sleep

Dr Ching

Jessinta

S he comes here a few times a week
to help

Hello

Okay, l'm leaving

Why are you leaving?

l don't want to disturb you

No problem

Miss Kong is my friend. S he is
staying here for a few days

Then should l come here these few days?

Why not?

l thought ...

Okay, l understand

S it over there

There's no place to walk around,
it's all in front of you

This is a special place

You collect old books and magazines?

l didn't collect them on purpose

This is my study room

This is a sofa bed, you can sleep here for
the time being

Your study room?

Would l be interrupting with your work?

My job is very simple, l just need to
cut people up

Thanks, it's really for the time being only

l won't interrupt you too long

Jessinta!

Yes, Dr Ching?

Please open up this sofa bed for me

And see what else Miss Kong needs

Yes

Sorry to trouble you

Never mind. lt's alright

But this thing hasn't been opened
for a long time

l guess it is not that difficult to open

By the way, how did you meet Dr Ching?

We met at the hospital

So you are a doctor too

No

Nurse?

No

Pharmacist?

No

Jessinta

Dr Ching?

What is it?

l only asked you to help

l didn't ask you to play Q & A with her

We were just chatting

Have you picked up the suit
from the laundry?

Okay, l'll get it in a minute

Miss Kong, did you see that?

See what?

He was so sarcastic at me

l think he must be in a good mood today

Usually he doesn't talk to me

ls he that funny?

l have worked for him so long

This is the first time he brings
a woman home

Really

And you are staying here too

You don't worry, Dr Ching is a gentleman

lt's only me and him in the house all day

and he was never impolite to me

Okay. l'll get you the blankets

l don't understand why you won't let me
clean the table

l just don't want you to mess up
my things

What's wrong with this?

Nothing?

Don't you have any manners

facing me with your back?

So what do you want me to do?

lf l sit like this, my feet hits the table

This way l have to hold up the noodles
and face you

lt's unnatural and my hands are tired

So the dining table solves the problem,
doesn't it?

Actually it won't take more than
1 0 minutes to fill the stomach

Why bother with so many things?

You have to be conscious about your
mood too when you eat

lf the atmosphere is not good,
it affects the appetite

Most importantly

l never faced anything with my back

Did l wake you?

You take so many books to the room?

Can you finish them?

That's none of your business

You've to go back to the hospital
tomorrow, go to sleep quick

Did you clean up for me?

l have to count on you for my food
and lodging now

l ought to help you clean up a bit

You won't be able to help me that way

Trust me, when you wake up
tomorrow morning

you would find the world more orderly

lf you're not satisfied, l'll revert
everything to its usual position

You don't have to

l do

l really said no

l really must

Okay

You are a bit late today

lf your girl friend needs some place
to stay

Would you let her stay at your place?

Even if l would she may not be willing
to stay at my place

So ... l guess l probably wouldn't

That's what l think too

That's why l let her stay

How come?

You say you understand people

l am sure you don't realize she is that ...

That ...

That what?

That interesting

Forget it, she hasn't many friends anyway

Help her as much as you can

That's true

l think she won't trouble you too long

That's true

l need not worry if you help her

Do you know that she loves to sing?

l don't know

And she sings everyday, l'm sure you
don't know that

You understand people?

Thanks

Dr Ching

That thing is not over yet, l still need
your help

But there is nothing else l can say

l have said what l have to say

Not you, l want to kook for
Yeung Ying-ming

He's not back, has he got to do with it?

That day at the ER

He was the one who took
the pregnant lady to lCU

So his opinion ...

#NAME?
the whole thing

Don't you fear scaring him?

l am more scared than he is

Sorry, l'm late

Never mind, there's still time

Caught by Kelvin to chat?

Yes

Big trouble?

Anyway l don't want anyone to be
in trouble because of me

More so, l don't want anyone to be hurt
because of me

Don't think too much

Just tell them clearly what you know
about the facts

You can't control who would be
in trouble or get hurt

What would you do if you were l?

Why not ask what would l want
from you if l were S .Y.?

l want you to tell the truth

What would be the result?
Everyone would blame you

You don't trust S .Y.?

No, why wouldn't l?

Why not trust me?

lf one feels no shame

He wouldn't care what others have to say

Give you five minutes to get to work

To be honest, how much are you
drinking tonight?

Ask yourself, how much do you
want to drink?

l'll want to drink as much as you do

Why isn't Crystal here yet?

May be she is enjoying herself elsewhere

S he is cruel to herself

Last time she told me she had an affair
with the photographer

And now she can only drink alone

There are good and bad times

What do you want to tell me?

Nothing, you should be happy when
you come out to have fun

ls men's happiness always sex related?

What about you?

Do you mean we as women or just me?

l am only interested in you tonight

l want to go to the washroom

Just now ...

Okay ... don't mention it

You must be out of luck tonight

What are you talking about?

l just saw a girl sitting on the floor
in the washroom

Looks like she's in the same field as you

What? You feeling sick?

l'm okay ...

ls my face alright?

What happened?

Nothing

lf l were you, l'd take a rest

Why did you follow me?

Are you happy today?

Can you leave me alone?

l never thought you could get that wild

Don't think that just because l smoked
your cigarette ...

#NAME?

l tell you now, definitely not

So what happened?

Why do you men ...

Think so easily that a woman ...

S itting with a man drinking and
chatting ...

Could then sleep with him?

l don't know about other men

The women l met, sometimes don't
even need a drink

Did someone hit you?

You want me to accompany
to call the police?

That's right, that's not your first time

You still think it's very funny

Do you know your are very disgusting?

More disgusting than the one
who hit you?

Please stop following me, can you?

Can you drive?

None of your business!

The food is ready

What food? Did you cook?

lt's my turn

Have you ever stayed in a hotel?

Are you being sarcastic again?

You must be a person who likes to move
the hotel furniture around

Be honest, don't you feel more
comfortable?

l am correct

After such a big operation, you still end
up having instant noodles

l will have a good appetite

l can cook well

There's just nothing for me to cook here

But don't worry, l'll solve this problem
for you

Please inform me first next time
you think of anything

Because there is not much food to eat ...

#NAME?

ls it your habit to shout at people?

Look what you've done?

What have l done?

Please. Be good

l had such a hard time cleaning up

lt's not like the past now

You must understand

everyone has his own living habits

What you think is messy to me may be ...

Another kind of order

l have been used to this kind of order
you call mess a long time

lt's difficult to cope with your kind of '''
order in a short time

l want you to understand too

Let's forget about messy or not first

l don't think your place is particularly
orderly now

l still think it a bit messy

Just like this sofa

if l may l would not put it here

So how long do you plan to stay here?

That's not important

l think that you, as a doctor

S hould have an orderly life

You should live in a clean place

l understand that it is difficult for you to
adapt in a short time

l'll give you time, don't worry

Hello!

You didn't think it would be me?

What do you want?

l have been busy this morning, l don't
have breakfast to serve you

You eat two eggs before you go out

Why don't you speak?

How come you have so much time?

l did a lot of things today

You don't have do so much for me

l sit in it too

l feel happier if it looks more handsome

You don't have to do that

lt's for you

You know, you always hit your car

That can secure your safety

And see how pretty this essence looks

lf you put it there, you would feel happier

What are you doing?

lt took me a lot of trouble to find it

Please show some due respect

l think we both got it wrong

lt's not Jackie who needs to be
taken care of

lt's my car

l just want to tell you, your car
looks cool

lf not for your previous relationship
with her

l wouldn't have ended up like this

Don't say such things

Good friends can become enemies too

l find that you still lack a bit of sense
of humour

lf you get along with her more

l'm sure you would progress

Just right, time for a fight

Go away!

ls it really locked?

Jessinta can't do anything else

her best dish is fried crab

That's really nice

What are you up to now?

Jessinta saw me for less than 4 hours
today

and she already knows l am not well

You're a doctor, can't you feel
l am not well?

l only know you look angry

l have a toothache, it's been bothering
me for a whole day

And you ask me to eat crab?

Why don't you go to the dentist then?

lt's no use losing your temper,
l can't help you

lt's so late now, where can l find
a dentist?

l am hungry and l can't eat this

What should l do?

You go to the dentist tomorrow
morning then

l'll fry two eggs for you now

Now what?

l'll fry the eggs myself

You eat your fried crab

lf you can't bite, you cook some
crab congee

Are you crazy?

So you are really crazy

You are crazy, laughing in front
of the fridge

You can be quite humorous

l don't know what you are talking about

Can you eat the crab now?

lt's not hurting now, is that okay?

l have been infected lately

l love to draw on round objects

Say that again

l just found your two kneecaps as
my new objects

What did you do to my toothpaste?

To scrub the pan

Do you know how much dirt
your pan has?

l scrubbed for half a day

Really?

You bet, l don't know what your
toothpaste is

lt can't clean the dirt

My hand still hurts from the scrubbing

The toothpaste is used for brushing teeth

Who told you to use the toothpaste
to scrub a pan?

Do you know that l don't have any
toothpaste to use now?

l have half, you can use it

l have nothing to say

You're so fierce, l'll buy one for you

l'll buy it myself

l've been watching you for a long time

You don't do that when you buy things
from the supermarket

See, it's a fleeting pleasure

You don't have to buy that much if even
gives you a fleeting pleasure

You won't finish it in a year

Come on, watch over for me

l still have something to buy

Buy toothpaste

The toothpaste is over there

Would you consider?

ls that your business?

l think you would look nice wearing this

l don't think l will wear it for you to see

Forget it

You would be grateful in future

Where's my toothpaste

lt's there, look for it

No

lt's here

This is yours, where's mine?

Don't you like this one?

Don't tell me you only bought this one

No, l have this one

l said my gums are sensitive,
l can't use normal toothpaste

You're a doctor

Can't you take some medicine?

You're insensitive to everything,
except your gums are sensitive

l have no time to discuss the medication
issue with you

l only want to know
where my toothpaste is

Then ... we'll go buy it again

We again?

l fear l might get it wrong

What are you doing?

Come in

You are in a bigger hurry than me,
you want to try it now?

No rush yet, come out and see

Haven't l seen it just now?
What's there left to see?

Cup noodles and instant noodles are here

Here are the snacks, biscuits and
canned food

Here are the spices

Here are the spring water

Your personal stuff, you put it yourself

This looks more like a real home now

Not only like a home, it's become
your home already

That's exaggerating

Later the security manager will call you
Mrs Ching

l warn you, don't tease me

l'll take a bath

Turn around

What are you doing?

l said you would look nice wearing this

Don't you have manners?
Coming in without knocking?

You look great

Get out! Get out!

Why do you have to be so fierce!

Great?

Almost forgot ...

You're here again?

l want to borrow some shampoo

Wait, l'll get it for you in a minute

No need to look

Add a tie, you can go to a banquet

There's nothing to feel troubled about

Either you tell the truth or you lie

Do you still have another way
to handle this?

l said it

What did you say?

l think the fact that S .Y. is suspected of
being prejudiced against the robber ...

#NAME?

lf you really suspect S .Y.

Even if we don't agree ...

l believe they would respect your opinion

Lately a lot of people do think S .Y.
has a problem

So you said what everyone felt
was the truth

l didn't

Even you don't trust me?

lt's not that l don't believe you

Trust is based on understanding

And understanding takes a long time

Although we've only been together
for 2 months

l feel you are quite ...

... interesting ...

#NAME?

But l don't really understand you

Would you feel ...

... feel that l ...

Don't have my own views?

lf you don't you wouldn't ask

Anyway ...

We will respect your views

Waiting for your ex-girlfriend's secret
call again?

l remembered something

lt might help me find that secret guy

How? l don't have any information

l don't even know who called

l have heard that telephone message ...

How can you do that?

You listen to me first

Do you realize that every time he calls ...

The background is noisy and
there is music

l know

That must be a disco or a pub

Do you know which one then?

You know?

Yes, l know

May be you have not noticed

The two times he called

The DJ was talking

l am familiar with that voice

l think l know where l can find him

Hope you guys enjoy the music

So, should you be thankful to me?

What do we do now?

Find a place first

May l help you two?

Please ask a male to come over

Just a minute

l am afraid they might call the police

Of course not

What would you like to order?

Can you say that again?

What would you like to order?

Can you ask another male to come over?

S he is joking, 2 glasses of red
wine please

Yes

You are really scared?

Let's find out ourselves

We can't just stand here

Could it be that one?

ls this called a man's pride?

You have to look for the most
handsome one here

Red wine for you two

Thank you

Look

What are you doing here?

Who's that lady you are getting along
so well with?

Don't you have any place to go?

Can we go now?

You don't want to know what happened
to your girlfriend?

You are great, it's half bent

l really don't want to know now

Sometimes there are a lot of things ...

Which you don't want your closest
friend to know

lt may not be because we have
betrayed them

May be we are just afraid it would hurt
them more if they know

Anyway, we can have a lot of reasons ...

for hiding so many things

Do you understand what l am saying?

l do, but ...

lf she does not want me to know

S he must have her reasons,
l shouldn't ask so much

l should let you know what l did

That guy just now is called Ronald

He also knows your ex-girlfriend

But it is Kenneth who is dating
your girlfriend

Ronald gave me Kenneth's number

lt's here

lf you want to know ...

Give him a call

What are you doing?

What do you mean?

You can really let go?

After all this effort ...

lt's a pity to burn it

Not really, l have straightened out
my thinking

But it doesn't matter if you regret it

l remember the number

You are great

l was just away for a while

And you have women chasing after you

l'm used to it, it's been like that
since l was small

You come all the way in the middle
of the night just to scare me?

You are so late too?

What did you say?

They are all saying, you and Jackie ...

Sounds funny

You testing me?

Just regard me as being curious

Come on

Don't be curious about this

You are telling everyone

you still feel for Jackie

just depends on whether l have
anything to do with her

So do you?

l am disappointed with you

Not now, but may be in future

Future? l may have something to do
with you in future

Actually, l just want to tell you

l don't care whether what the people
say is true or not

l don't mind

Don't talk to me about this, buddy

Go tell everyone

What can there be between Jackie
and me?

Things are never absolute

You're early

l'm used to it, it's not that early

You seemed to be back quite late
last night

What time were you back?

l don't remember

May be 1 :00 a.m

l thought you didn't have any friends
except Paul

They were all ex-colleagues

Thanks

You're not eating?

l have eaten already

They even found a job for me

Really?

Where are you going?

l don't know how to use knife and fork
to eat macaroni

Sorry, wait a second

What kind of job?

ln an accountants' firm

Thanks

When do you start work?

Next week

l have good news for you

What?

l found a place to move at last

Really?

When will?

Soon

l thought you would laugh

l will

l'll laugh when you are really gone

So l think l should buy you a meal

Breakfast doesn't count?

We have to go to a high-class restaurant
with good food ...

Where you pay a lot of tips

S ince you have been Jessinta, you
haven't broken my underpants

l should buy you a meal

That's alright too, where do you
want to go?

Are you dating me?

Just a meal, does that count as a date?

lf that's not a date, what is?

Dating should be done by men

lf you are good, you don't need me

You're leaving?

How about dinner together?

l am having dinner with a friend

Next time then

l am seeing Jackie

You aren't off yet?

You don't have to tell me who you are
going out with

Have you anything to say to me?

Actually, l ...

l don't want you to leave

l want you to stay

lf l don't see you when l come home

l think l will be very depressed

How does that sound?

l know there will be other people
saying these things to me

But they will be more sincere

You wait and see

Having lived here for so long

l have never taken anyone for
a walk here

l really miss this

What do you think l miss?

Probably me

A little bit

But l miss the place here more

lf you miss it, do something.

That's why ... l want to take a walk here

What about me?

l only miss you a bit

What do you think l should do?

Do you think l am troublesome?

You used to be

Would you treat me as your
good friend now?

You don't treat someone as a good friend

Either you are or you are not

So, am l or am l not?

Yes or no?

Still awake?

l have to pack

What are you looking for?

Do you know where the needle
and thread is?

l have them, what do you want it for?

Nothing

l cut myself while fixing
the cabinet door

You're so careless

Found it?

Can You manage?

Looks like the cut is very deep

Look, you know how to do
a brain surgery

and you can't even pick a thorn out

Let me help you

Sorry

l'm okay

Okay

Thanks

Need to put some medication on?

No

lt seems l still haven't told you

whether we are good friends

Yes

Of course we are

But there are many kinds of good friends

Which kind are we?

l think it is ...

The kind which, if you can't be my friend

l would regret it

l get it

You can get even with this,
you are wonderful

l have done my best

Yours?

l haven't noticed in the past

Can't l have a look?

No

You should say that earlier

What's there to hide?

Everyone has privacy, okay?

You just have that much?

Yes, l just need to call a cab

You don't have to drive me there

l didn't sleep well last night

You have company

Don't you want to know why?

l have heard too many insincere words

Then shouldn't you do some
self-criticism?

You insist on escorting me

So that you can have some more time
to drive me mad?

lf you suddenly remember the
surroundings here in future

and you miss it, would you ...

come back and take a walk?

l think ...

l wouldn't

There's a kind of people with
a strange charm

lt can influence you gradually

Though l still cannot feel ...

That kind of fleeting pleasure when
one buys unnecessary stuff

l would even try it

The conclusion is that it is irrelevant
to the charm

Because something's has happened

The problem is ...

When can we convince ourselves
to accept it

Still awake?

Am l your youngest patient?

You have been thinking about this
all night?

l am young, and energetic

l'm even studying medicine

May be l'll be a good doctor in future

Now l have AVM, would you feel sorry
for me?

Every patient has his own story

You can't say who shouldn't have
what kind of disease

So that's not a question of being sorry,
understand?

My family loves me and l love them

They can give up anything to cure
my disease

l don't want to see them take
so much pain

lf you know they love you

you should take good care of yourself

Go to sleep

You're off today?

You don't look well, you're okay?

l'm fine, just a toothache

Did you go to the dentist?

lt's okay

lf someone can make me laugh ...

l'll be fine

Mom, l dropped my ball

No! lt's dangerous!

l'm going

Look out! Be careful!

The miss picked up the ball for you

Thank you, miss

Thank you. Are you okay?

l'm fine

Okay, bye

Jackie!

S it down first

Somebody, help!

Help!

Please, call the ambulance

Yan Ping Road, Causeway Bay ...

What do you want?

l can still manage to get a glass of water

Let me help you

By the way, when can l leave?

lsn't it comfortable here?

l have stayed here for so long

Even if l have to live in the streets

l wouldn't want to come back

You can go after the CT-brain

l just shed two drops of nose blood,
it's nothing

Two drops?

You bled all over

l have been suffering from toothache

And didn't sleep well, it's because
my internal heat is rising

l'm fine really

We won't keep you too long

You understand?

God would not be too cruel to me

l wouldn't be that out of luck

lf l didn't die last time, l'll be okay
this time

You don't believe it? Take a bet

Don't make fun of your own health

What if l win?

You'd better be careful

l would if l am sick, but l am not

Don't think as if you are a doctor

lf anything happens it would be
dangerous

Anyway, l don't want to do the CT-brain

You still haven't left at this hour?

lt's Jackie's

lt's AVM

lt's too unfair for her

A criminal can start a new life after
serving his sentence

Why can't she have one more chance?

There is still something we can do

Look carefully

Even if l do this surgery

l am not sure if l can help her

Have you thought about how to tell her?

Tell the truth

Tell her she could die any moment

no one can help her?

Sometimes l really admire you

There are a lot of things which you can
do and l can't

What if l can?

lt doesn't make a difference how l tell her

The truth is the truth

Everyone is the same

You can also tell me that l may die
any moment

Who knows what will happen in
the next minute?

May be a van hits over and we will
all be dead

How long since you have been
that troubled?

Remember the last time ...

Who and what are you troubled with?

Good, looks like it's a person

lt's a good thing

So ...

Even l couldn't do this ...

Telling the one we love

about such a cruel fact

needs great courage

May be more than telling her ...

How much l need her

Where are you?

Can you do me a favour?

l drank too much and can't drive

Can you come out and take me home?

You can't drink, so don't drink so much

How's it? Where's the car key?

How are you doing?

You seem to have drunk more than l have

How can you drive?

l can

l really can

Give me the key

Don't

Take a rest in the car

No need to look after me

l'm really okay

What's so happy about tonight?

You drank so much?

A lot happened

l don't know if it's happy ...

or unhappy ...

What about you?

Why did you drink so much too?

l lied to a good friend

What kind of good friend?

Like you and me ...

or another kind?

You are honest

At least you admit you lied

What's up?

Why did you lie to your good friend?

l said it before

there must be a reason ...

for hiding things

You never treated your patients like
this in the past

Patients are another matter

Why do you do this to me?

What do you know?

l think ...

everything which l ought not know ...

l know already

You are afraid l would be unhappy
if l knew

so you lied to me

l would be happy

lt's not worth it

l lost

The heavens ...

can really be very cruel

Time and time again ...

l thought l would be lucky

So it may not be a good thing to have
another chance

the result would only hurt you one
more time

The problem l have to face ...

is the same as yours

Why are you so late?

This came so sudden, l have things
to do too

What do we do now?

The deceased's family are all over there

They have decided not to proceed

Let's talk inside

Okay

Sorry for interrupting at this hour

Never mind

What's the position now?

They are very reasonable

so the problem has been solved

l wanted to get back justice

But my husband is dead already, it's no
use how much you pay me

S ince you have apologized, l don't want
any more trouble

Mrs Wong is very understanding

Excuse me, l have some important
things to do

l won't see you out

Let's go

We may not lose this case

Some people ...

choose to use the simplest method
to solve their problems

What about dignity?

This may not be important to
a lot of people

l am very sorry this time

Never mind, l'm going

Thank you

Forget it, sister

so long as we have accounted for
this with brother, that's it

You so back first

Thank you

Thanks, goodbye

You have a lot of friends

They need to discuss something with me

l have no reason not to let them have
my views

Are you helping me then?

What psychological problem
do you have?

You like to put on acts so much

You don't seem to need help

lf you think that one can put on an act
whether it's for good or bad

then it's you who has a psychological
problem

lt's me

Sorry, l was busy just now and
couldn't call

Okay, l'll wait for you here

Call me when you are here

Jackie!

S ir, you know her?

S he is my friend, what happened?

l don't know, she suddenly fainted

l called the police for you

Don't worry, you'll be fine

Don't be scared, it will be alright

Jackie ...

Do you know where you are?

Am l in the hospital?

Right

Can you move your hands and legs?
Any pain in the neck?

l can move

Can't l leave?

l want to give you something,
hope you like it

lf it is a ring, the box seems a bit too big

lf you would take our advice and do
the surgery

This present would be most suitable

So if l take your present

l'll have to let you open up my brain

What's so precious you have?

Open it

My hair is much more beautiful than this

lf you can get back your life

Just put up with this for the time being

Actually, l feel happy about something

Which is ...

You never had a chance to see my ugly
looks before

So if you want me to become bald
headed ...

You can open up my brain

l think there's a problem here

How about this?

lf you would do the surgery ...

l'll wear this wig

And let you see my ugly looks

Quit this mediocre talk

Just one line

lmagine everything will be fine
when you wake up

Don't worry

l'll try to help you too

Now we'll inject the anesthetics

Let's begin

Pulse 79, BP 90/1 40

Hemorrhage

S uction

Pulse 1 35, BP 30/70

More pressure, transfusion

Continue

lf this continues

Her problem would become more
and more serious

Wrap the head, l couldn't do the surgery

Anything you want to tell me?

Seeing you being tortured by this disease

l feel hurt

You talk to me like that

You know l am easily touched?

l have tried my best

But couldn't help you

Never mind

Before the surgery ...

l had thought l may never wake up
and see you.

Now l can see you and even chat
with you

l should be happy

Trust me, l'll never give up

Trust me too

lf l don't become too ugly ...

l really don't mind

Whey isn't Dr Ching here?

Never mind, we can come back to
visit him later

Let's get a cab

We don't need to take a cab, a bus is fine

Has Ms Kong been looking for me?

Yes, l said you were not around

S he's waiting for you in the office

Anything wrong?

S he has been discharged

lt also happened in a sudden

l don't know why, she decided to leave

Because she never gave me the chance
to find the answer

l want to let you know, l have decided
to leave

Because l know that you have
no other solution

Nothing else you can do for me

Except for staying with me ...

And waiting for that day

You are different from me

You see the people you care
leave one by one

And you have to continue with your life

l can imagine it is a sad thing

Sometimes l think you are more
unfortunate than l am

lf God wants me to leave this world

l know there is nothing l can do

But l wouldn't just give up

There was once a miracle that woke me

l have confidence there would be
a second miracle

l don't know where she is now

But ...

l know if there is this day ...

When she remembers all that has
happened here

Remembers ...

The surroundings she missed

l'm sure l'd still have a chance to see
her here
