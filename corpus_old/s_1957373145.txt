[IvÃ¡n] <i>I had that dream again.</i>

<i>I have it all the time.</i>

[festive music playing over speakers]

<i>It's so real.</i>


<i>I'm in Mexico, my home.</i>

<i>I've returned.</i>

<i>My eyes are open.</i>

<i>And there I am, my younger self.</i>

<i>This dream always ends the same way.</i>

<i>I wake up in my bed soaked in sweat.</i>

<i>And I realize I can't go back.</i>

<i>And if I left here, what was it all for?</i>

[indistinct chatter]

{\an8}[man] Order up!

{\an8}[man laughs]

{\an8}Here it is.

{\an8}Here it is.


[IvÃ¡n] <i>There were so many lines. Sorry.</i>

not to give him juice.

It's water.

Paola, I left some chicken
in the fridge for you.

There's enough
for Ricky's lunch tomorrow.

-Good evening, ma'am.
-Good evening.

I'm going to take him back.

Evening, sir.

-Good evening.
-Excuse me.

[livestock making noise over TV]

[tranquil music playing over TV]

[both growling playfully]

You tricked me, huh?

Sit up. Let's clean you up.

And then it's time for bed, okay?

Let's see.

Let's see if this comes off.

-Does it hurt?
-No.

-I can't...
-[Paola] IvÃ¡n.

Hey.

Thanks for letting me spend
some time with him.

When can I see him again?

He needs new sneakers.

I know that.

Here.

Take this too.

-You'll have enough for the bus?
-Yes, don't worry.

When they pay me, I'll buy the shoes.

Take care of yourself.

[door closes]

[indistinct chatter]

[trumpet music playing softly]

[man 1] Hey, the mole. Try the mole.

[man 2] Add some onions.

Mole plate for Table 2.

It smells good, man.

Who do you think made it?

Yours truly.

You're still using the mortar and pestle?

Of course. That's how you make mole.

I told you to try it with the blender.

That'll make it bitter.

No. Wanna know my dad's secret?

-What?
-As soon as you take the tomatoes

out of the pan, you blend them right away
and it's not bitter.

It's faster.

-Try it and see for yourself.
-[man 3] IvÃ¡n.

-Toilet handle's broken again. Fix it.
-Yes, boss.

[man 4] People, Table 5 is still waiting.

[toilet flushing]

[IvÃ¡n] Sir! Sir.

What's up? Did you fix the toilet?

-Yes, it's working.
-Great.

Sir, remember telling me
about the kitchen position?

That when Pedro left, it was my turn.

Can you believe it?
My nephew just moved back here

and I had to give the job to him.
Gotta help the family, you know.

But I've been waiting a year.

Yeah, but some people wait four
or five years to set foot in the kitchen.

Deal with it. That's all.

But I have a diploma.
I went to the culinary institute.

Yes, I know.

Just be thankful that you have a job.

Some people have nothing.

You lack patience.

Patience. I'll catch you later.

[calliope music playing faintly]


[IvÃ¡n] Chulita, you're early.
How'd you get in?

I gave your landlord a hand job.

I didn't know the old lady liked that.


So this is your new hideout.

On the phone,
you said it was like a sardine can.

-It's not?
-No!

It's more like...

a smelly shoebox.

[IvÃ¡n laughs]

Cheers.


Babe...

I thought you had dumped that idiot.

Remember Janeth?

-Who?
-Janeth.

From Building 21?
The slutty one. Sluttier than you.

Thank you!

She crossed over.

She left with a guy from Building 21.

They have some easy job
in a flower shop or something.

And she sends a lot of money
to her family.

Her dumbass brother bought
a truck in Ecatepec.

And his wife dyed her hair blond.

"Because a natural blond...

-always attracts attention."
-"Always attracts attention."

[both laugh]

They went to New York, Chulito.

Fucking amazing.

[Sandra sighs]

So? Where am I taking you
to get shit-faced?

[IvÃ¡n] Let me change real quick.


I've never been. But they say it's cool.

[dance music playing faintly]

[dance music playing over speakers]


-Hello.
-[Sandra chuckles]

[man 1] Yeah? Or what?

[man 2] We'll see.


-[IvÃ¡n] What?
-Do you see that?

What?


Over there, look.

He's handsome.

-[IvÃ¡n] But it's not him.
-Yes, it is.

He's got his briefcase and everything.

Go on. Talk to him.

You must be lost.

I don't know if anyone told you,
but this is a gay bar.

How come I haven't seen you before?

What, you know everyone here?

Pretty much.

Then you must know who I am.

You're from Mexico City.

You've been living here
for a couple of years.

Hmm?

[Gerardo chuckles]

You're...

What are you?

["Amorcito CorazÃ³n" playing over speakers]

I don't believe you.

That must have gone over great
in Guerrero.

In Chiapas.

Even worse.

Let's just say I made it out alive.

If I had been there,
I could have taught you how to pass.

So where were you in 1985
when I really needed you? Hm?

Jerking off.

To my Tom Cruise poster.

You really never ran into trouble
with anyone?

I know how to pass.

You're obviously really good at it.

[church bells tolling]

You see that convent over there?

Yeah.

That's where they invented
Chiles en Nogada.

-No way.
-Yeah.

Really?

And how did it happen?

[IvÃ¡n chuckles]

I moved to Puebla to learn how to cook.

And when I got here,
I went to that convent.

And a nun opens the door.

She says, "God bless you, brother,

but this place is for women only.
You can't be here."

[Gerardo laughs]

So you told her you were gay

-and they let you in, right?
-Jerk.

I told her that I wanted
the original recipe for Chiles en Nogada

and I could offer a donation.

She said, "How much?"
I told her a thousand.

And she slams the door in my face.

-No way.
-Yeah.

So she comes back about ten minutes later.

She opens the door and says:

"Mother Superior says 2,000 or no deal."

Those are some sneaky nuns.

Yeah, and I'm sneaky too
because, in the end, I got that recipe.

[mellow music playing]

I have to go.

Give me your number.

I don't have a phone.


But I'm going to see you again, right?

Yeah.

[indistinct chatter]

Thanks.

-Have a good day.
-See you soon.

See you tomorrow, Don Pedro.

[Rosa Maria chuckles] <i>You sound different.</i>

<i>I can almost hear you smile.</i>

<i>Tell me who the lucky girl is?</i>

[IvÃ¡n] <i>Mom...</i>

[Rosa Maria] <i>So is it serious?</i>

<i>Tell me. What's she like?</i>

[IvÃ¡n] <i>It's... It's too early to know.</i>

[Rosa Maria] <i>Mmm.</i>

<i>What does she look like?</i>

[IvÃ¡n] <i>She looks just like you.</i>

[Rosa Maria chuckles] <i>God forbid!</i>

[IvÃ¡n] <i>Ma, my break is over.</i>

<i>I'll call you later, okay?</i>

<i>Take care of Dad.</i>

<i>Do what you can.</i>

[Marcos speaking indistinctly
over megaphone]

<i>...for your tamales.</i>

Hello! Testing! Testing!

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

Hey, you, fatty! Don't you want a tamale?

To keep up those curves!

Fatty!

If you wanna get big and strong,
a tamale will keep you young.

[commercial playing over radio]

[Rosa Maria] Not too much meat.
It's expensive.

Wow, Ma.

It's looking awesome.

Eh, eh, eh! No dirty hands. Eh?

Julissa should pay you double.

It's her party. She should look beautiful.

-Hey, Ma. Can I have one too?
-Hmm?

A quinceaÃ±era party?

It's only for girls, IvÃ¡n. Don't start
that again. It's only for girls.

-Shh, shh.
-[baby crying]

-I'm leaving you in charge.
-Yeah, Ma. Good luck.

[mellow music playing]

Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

Sandra! Are you okay?

Wait for me, Chulito.

No fucking way.

Not too vulgar.

But that's how Madonna does it.


For such a handsome guy,
you make a pretty ugly girl.

Time's up, guys.

No one should still be writing.
Time's up.

Because I'm in a good mood,

here's a chance for extra credit.

What's the natural tendency
of every business?


I think I'm going
to have to make the exam harder.

You're doing them too quickly.

[indistinct chatter]

Look.

-Look at these.
-But they're too big, right?

Let's ask.

Look!

This one's amazing.


-Good evening.
-[woman] We're about to close.

But it's still early. Can you show us
one of these real quick?

-Yes, real quick.
-[woman] We're closing.

I can't help you.

Thank you.

I know I've got a great ass,

but how much do you think
a figure like that would cost me?

Like that?

Well, that would definitely require
a trip to Thailand.

Shut up, asshole!

And for that butt,
maybe a trip to Brazil too.

Imagine all the fags
who'd come to my show.

So many.

Of course.
We'd have to add more tables.

You'd look gorgeous too.


Son of a bitch.

[inaudible dialogue]

That's your Mr. Nobody, right?

Yeah.

Would you look at him?

It's so typical.

["Piel Canela" playing over speakers]

[indistinct chatter]

[singing along to "Piel Canela"]

[audience cheering and whistling]

[feedback whines over speakers]

[man over speakers]
<i>Good evening, bitches and boys.</i>

<i>Please give a big welcome
to the grand diva of Puebla,</i>

<i>Cucusa Minelly.</i>

-[applause]
-["Ã‰l Me MintiÃ³" playing over speakers]

<i>â™ª He lied to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He told me he loved me
And it wasn't true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He lied to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He didn't love me
He never did â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He let me adore him
He lied to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He lied to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was only a game â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was a cruel and vain game â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He lied to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My heart is broken â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My face full of tears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm so wretched â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd rather die â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lies, it was all lies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Words to the wind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just the whim of a little boy â™ª</i>

[audience cheering]

Okay, that's enough.

Enough.

All right, welcome, my friends.

So nobody here is gay, right?

-But I support you, I do.
-[audience laughs]

I put on heels and stuff
just so you don't feel so bad.

[indistinct chatter]

-Oh.
-What?

Look who it is.

Oh, no.

You love to get hurt, huh?

Take care.

-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

I'll let you take care of business.


Hey.

This is my bus.

You better have exact change.

-Does she know about you?
-No.

I can't tell her.
You know how people are here.

If she finds out,
I'll never see my son again.

She's the one who decides
whether I get to see him or not.

So, what are you going to do?

How are you going to raise him,
hiding like this?

I'm not sure.

For starters, I need a job
where they pay me more.

I've been thinking about crossing over.

You'd make
a pretty complicated boyfriend.

[mellow music playing]

[calliope music playing]

<i>â™ª We want cake â™ª</i>

[dance music playing over speakers]

[IvÃ¡n] Does all this land belong
to your family?

to my great-grandfather.

-Eyes closed!
-They are.

Let's see.

Wow, Ma.

I'll make room.

Let's see.

-How do I look?
-Wonderful.

-It looks great.
-Yeah?

-You look so elegant.
-Thanks a lot, Mom.

-It looks beautiful.
-Very elegant.


[playing notes]

Pretty, right?

I bet you spent all your afternoons here.

I wore this around when I was 8 years old.

Can you imagine? [chuckles]

[man whistles]

[indistinct chatter]

-Who's responsible?
-I don't know, sir.

-I'll check.
-Don't say, "I don't know."

He has a bad temper, huh?

What's that?

Your father's going to catch us.

He's too old.

He wouldn't make it up the stairs.

-That's good.
-Thanks, Mom.


[IvÃ¡n] Good evening.

I'm IvÃ¡n.

Good evening.

Hi, Dad.


[CÃ©sar] How many cows gave birth today?

Two, Dad.

The black one's about ready,
keep an eye on her.

Yes, Dad, I'll check her.

[CÃ©sar] The coffee's cold.

You know I like it burning hot.

What's that you're wearing?

You don't like it?

No.

What do you do for work?


No.


No. I help out in a kitchen.

I wash the dishes.

[CÃ©sar chuckles]

the maid washes the dishes.


[CÃ©sar] That's woman's work, right?

When are you leaving?

Early tomorrow.

[CÃ©sar] Hm.

They probably have things to do.

[IvÃ¡n] Yes, ma'am,
we have to go back to work.

[somber music playing]

[vehicle approaching]

[Magda speaks indistinctly]

[CÃ©sar] Let's go.

[door closes]

[young Gerardo] Dad?

[footsteps approaching]

Get up. Get up!

-Dad?
-[CÃ©sar] Shut up!

-Where are we going?
-[CÃ©sar] I said, shut up.


Are you going to tell me?

Aren't you a man?

Huh?

Eh?

Don't you think I'm ashamed
that everyone in the village

is saying this shit?

Didn't I teach you to be a man?

Why do you act
like a fucking little girl? Huh?

Everyone is saying you're a faggot.

-Is that what you are?
-No, Papa.

So why are they saying it?

I don't know.

Do you know what happens
to people like you?

They get killed.

And they get tossed into the mountains.

Is that how you want to end up?

No.

Stay here and learn what'll happen
if you keep acting like this.

[door opens]

[door closes]

[engine starts]


I'm looking for you.</i>

<i>It's about the rent.</i>

IvÃ¡n, you still haven't paid him?

[IvÃ¡n] I'm on it.

I told you, I can lend you
the money again, no problem.

And I told you no.

Well, it's up to you.

[thunder crashing]

-[doorbell buzzes]
-[Rosa Maria] IvÃ¡n, are you there?

It's my mom.

Your mom, here in Puebla?

She's here with my kid and Paola.

-So?
-They're going to want to come up.

I'm your friend from work, right?

[Rosa Maria] IvÃ¡n!

Hi, Mom.

Ricky, what happened?

I fell at school.

-[IvÃ¡n] Does it hurt?
-Yeah.

Where were you?
He fell on Thursday and broke his arm.


Where were you?

[IvÃ¡n] Some friends from work
invited me to Hidalgo.

It was a last-minute thing.

I'm sorry. I should've let you know.

The boy's better now.

But he insisted on seeing you.
He wanted to see his dad.

Ricky, how about we go to Sanborns
and get an ice cream?


[Rosa Maria] It's raining.

Can we use your bathroom?

-Ricky needs it.
-It's broken.

It's not working. There's no water.

[Rosa Maria] IvÃ¡n, why can't we come in?


Mom, you just can't come in.

Is it that guy you're always with?

What are you talking about?

-Let's go.
-But I want my ice cream.

It's late. Come on.

-Come.
-Mom, wait.

I knew it.

I don't want you coming near Ricky or me.

Paola, he's my son.

You have nothing to offer us.

I'm going home.

[ominous music playing]

Take that off.

Your mother worked hard on it.

[door closes]

What's going on, IvÃ¡n?

What are you doing here?

What time are you coming home?

Late. I told you, I have to wait
until my boss gets back from Cholula.

Okay, I'll be waiting.

-Don't be late.
-Hmm.

What is it, Chulito?

What happened?

[inaudible dialogue]


<i>Pluck chickens?</i>

Pick grapes or whatever the fuck
they pick in California?

Avocados?

IvÃ¡n, we're gay.

We don't pick avocados.

I have better opportunities there
to become a chef.

I'm talented,
and they love talent over there.

Thank you.

We're fine here.

No, we aren't fine.

You're fine.

Come with me.

They hate us over there.

Then why does everyone
who goes there end up staying?

This whole bullshit dream is just because
your mom caught you with your boyfriend.

Grow up.

I need to move Ricky forward.
I need to move myself forward.

I need to leave.

You could die.

Haven't you seen the photos?

Texas, Arizona...

That place destroys people
with loneliness.

Gerardo, you're going to be proud of me.

[dramatic music playing]

[IvÃ¡n] <i>I love you.</i>


[IvÃ¡n] <i>One year.</i>


[IvÃ¡n] <i>Do you believe in destiny?</i>

<i>I've always believed that we all have
something special waiting for us.</i>

<i>It's like life has a surprise
for each one of us.</i>

<i>You are my surprise.</i>

<i>But you arrived a little too soon.</i>

you're going to do what I say.

Roberto Martinez.

IvÃ¡n and Sandra Campos.

Is this for both of you?

Your wife's too fat, no?

[IvÃ¡n] Excuse me?

She's not going to make it.

-[Sandra] Yes, I can.
-She'll fall behind, man.

No, she can do it.

I can.


Javier Garcia.

Let's go.

Jesus, there's a ton of thorns!

-You all right?
-Yeah.

-He said it was four hours, didn't he?
-Yeah.

So it's like watching two movies in a row.

Oh, Chulita.

-What's wrong?
-I feel sick. I'm already exhausted.

Chulita.

Take a second to breathe.

Let's go or they'll leave us.
You can do this.

-[Sandra] Chulito.
-Come on.

[helicopter whirring]


Run!

[all clamoring]

[IvÃ¡n] Are you all right? Sandra!

Sandra, Sandra.


Sandra, get up!

Chula.

I'm begging you, please.

-[Sandra] I can't.
-Get up.

[man 1] I've had enough
of this fucking fat ass.

We can't wait anymore.

I told you.

All right, guys.

Let's go. If we hurry up,
we'll make it before dawn.

Hold on.

My wife needs five minutes.
Please, just five minutes!

No, there's no time to lose.
I warned you, motherfucker.

[man 2] We can't just leave her here.

She could die.

Who the fuck are you, eh?

Because of these assholes,
we're all going to get caught.

Come on, let's go.

Please don't go.
Give us five minutes. Please, sir!

-[footsteps departing]
-Just five minutes, please!

Wait for us!

[man 1] To the left. Left, asshole!

-They're leaving. Stand up.
-I can't.

I can't. Just go.

Go. Let them catch me
and send me home.

I can't do it.

No.

[Sandra mutters]

[IvÃ¡n] Wait for me!

-[mutters]
-I'm coming!


Chula! Chula!


Forgive me.

We're not going to die
in the fucking desert.

[suspenseful music playing]


[Sandra grunts, then gasps]

[IvÃ¡n speaks indistinctly]

[vehicle approaching]


Hey! Hey! Over here!

Stop!


I am. But my friend isn't.

Are we still in Mexico?

No, son, you're in the United States.

[IvÃ¡n] Thank God.

Can you give us a ride?

Anywhere. Please.

It's too dangerous.

But, look, take this road for 40 minutes.

Stay close to the shoulder
because Immigration comes through here.

At the end of the road, you'll find

the San Luis Middle School.

The janitor's name is Sid.

Tell him Jimena sent you.
He can help you. Eh?

Are you sure you can't take us?

Honestly, I can't.

But, look, I can give you this.

Here. Here.

-Thanks.
-May God bless you.

Good luck.

Thank you.

I don't.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

But listen to me, I'm coming back soon.

You're going to be late for school.

[IvÃ¡n] <i>Dear son...</i>

<i>we said goodbye 14 years ago.</i>

<i>I remember your innocent face.</i>

<i>I told you I would come back.</i>

<i>I never came.</i>

<i>Now you know the truth.</i>

<i>If I leave here, I can never return.</i>

<i>When you dream, it all happens so fast.</i>

<i>Like flashes.</i>

<i>The American dream happens
in slow motion.</i>

<i>It takes years.</i>

<i>I came here to accomplish something.</i>

<i>Don't lose faith in me.</i>

[indistinct chatter]

-[man] Moving it. Ready?
-Hold on.

[IvÃ¡n in English] Any phone cards?


How much is it?

Two for $1.

-And one?
-Fifty cent.

[Gerardo over phone]
<i>An hour later than we agreed.</i>

[IvÃ¡n in Spanish]
<i>We finished late at work.</i>


Good. Just great. Everything is super.

I cooked today.

I made enchiladas.

<i>With chicken or pork?</i>

With chicken.

<i>And?</i>

Everyone loved them.

But the chef was really impressed.

He said he hadn't tried them before

and that I have a unique talent.

<i>It surprised him?</i>

I told you, they're really weird here.

They don't use cilantro.
They put parsley in everything.

<i>I told you, the United States is
a barbaric place, IvÃ¡n.</i>

<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

I miss you.

I miss you a lot.

<i>You've been gone for more than a year.</i>

<i>I'm not as good at waiting
as I thought I was.</i>

<i>IvÃ¡n...</i>

<i>I'm coming.</i>

[IvÃ¡n]<i> No. You can't come.</i>

<i>This isn't for you.</i>

<i>Gerardo, you have to forget about me.</i>

<i>For a while.</i>

[somber music playing]

-[man] Age?
-[Gerardo] Twenty-six years old.

Properties here in Mexico?

Uh... I have an apartment in Puebla.

Value?

Eight thousand dollars.

Any other properties?

Mmm... Well, my family has
a ranch in Chiapas.

A cattle ranch.

Teaching assistant
at the University of Puebla?

Yes. Um...

[in English] I'm a graduate student.

Have you traveled internationally before?

Outside of Mexico?

[in Spanish] No. Never.

Do you have children in Mexico
or in the U.S.?

No. No.

Family members
or loved ones in the U.S.?

No. No one.

[in English] Sorry.

[in Spanish] Next.

Next.

I'm going to tell him.

-Gerardo, don't.
-Yes.

No, that's enough.

Get yourself together, queen.

Look what happens
when you drink like this.

Faggots.

Look at the little homos.

-Little faggots.
-Gerardo.

Gerardo, stop.

Hit him!

[all clamoring]

-[man 1] That's it. It better hurt.
-[man 2] Jerk.

<i>You have a profession here.</i>

<i>Everything you've built, son.</i>

Hey.

like a pizza to you, idiot?

-[knocking on door]
-[dog barks]

[man in Spanish] Hey, it's the Mexican!

-[dog barking]
-[in English] Yo. I said, shut it.

[woman in Spanish] What's wrong
with that fucking dog?

Chula.

-Chula.
-What's up?

Are you going out?

I have to go to work
in half an hour, remember?

I made you pozole.

I'm not hungry. Leave it there.

You okay?

Janeth told me that...

her friend went to Miami on vacation,

and she got picked up at the airport.

She got deported just like that.

At the airport?

Chula, it's going to pass.

They hate us here.

I want to go back.

But you're doing fine.

My mom said
she saw your mom in a new car.

You know what my mom said?

That she'd rather sit
across from me in the kitchen

than drive around alone in that car.

And it's used, the car.

It's a 12-year-old Toyota Camry.

Everyone's over there.

And you and me over here?

And your mom?

And the kid?

Is Gerardo gonna wait for you forever?

I'm leaving.

Let's go.

No.

No.

We came here to do something.
We have to do something.

[dramatic music playing]

-[IvÃ¡n] <i>Ventana.
</i>-<i>Ventana?</i>

<i>Ventana, ventana.</i>

[in English] Window, no?

-[in English] Window?
-Window.


[in Spanish] Like this.

Window.

[in Spanish] I don't think
that's how you write it.

[in Spanish] How do you say <i>"horno"?</i>

<i>Horno...</i>

How do you say <i>"parrilla"?</i>

<i>Parrilla?</i>

Look, <i>"parrilla"</i> is "grill."

Spell it.

-G-R-I...
-Mm-hm. I?

-An I or a Y? Mm-hm.
-An I.

-L-L. Grill.
-L-L.

Wait, there's a word I can't remember.

It was "mushrooms."

[both in English] Mushrooms.

-Mushrooms.
-[in Spanish] What is it?

Mushrooms. Mushrooms.

Mushrooms?

[in Spanish] IvÃ¡n,
doesn't that mean <i>"hongos"?</i>

-<i>ChampiÃ±ones.
</i>-What a dumbass.

-<i>ChampiÃ±ones.
</i>-How do you spell it?

-How do you spell it?
-<i>ChampiÃ±ones.</i>

No, in English!

[in English] Mushrooms.

[in Spanish] We've got a total
of $212 between us.

[man 1] You need more salt in this.
Come on. Let's go.

All right. How's that sauce coming?
Let me take a look.

Oh, for fuck's sake.
You burnt the shit out of it.

-[man 2] What was that, boss?
-[man 1] Start it over.

-[pans clattering]
-Pick it the fuck up.

[shouting indistinctly]

[man 2] Come on, chef.

[man 1] Put your fucking hands on me?
You burn my fucking shit?

Stupid motherfucker, I swear to God,
you get the fuck out of my restaurant!

Back to work! Let's go.

[man 3] All right, come on, guys, come on.

[man 1] Come on, man down.

Go down to the window.
Yes, you, over there. Move now.

Pick it up.

[in English] Yo. Me. I can help.

Cooking school, in Mexico, in Puebla.

IvÃ¡n.

[man 1] Oh, my God, for chrissakes.
You're the fucking delivery guy.

Go on, get him a fucking apron.
Let's go. Let's go.

Go ahead.

Go.

[man 1] I'm gonna go
and see if I got any leftover risotto.

I'm gonna try and save this dinner.
I think I can do it.

You just keep doing what you're doing.
You keep chopping.

Make sure
the positions are right on those, okay?

All right, let's go.

Hey, you, Eric. You, come over here.

Go to the walk-in right now, okay?
You need to get me eight zucchinis, okay?

One large butternut squash.

And you need to get me, uh,
20 bella mushrooms. Go, go!

And parsley!

Finely chopped.

[momentous music playing]

[man 1] That's good, but just do it
a little shorter, all right?

It's ready, chef.

[IvÃ¡n in Spanish] <i>I'll take care of you.</i>

<i>You came to me.</i>

<i>You left everything.</i>

<i>Now we are intertwined.</i>

<i>They say
that we'll have to live in hiding here.</i>

<i>But I just want to live.</i>

<i>Can we just live?</i>


[rock music playing]

[Sandra over phone]<i> Chulito, how are you?</i>

<i>Everything's great here in Chiapas.</i>

<i>Gerardo told me that you finally got
into a real kitchen.</i>

<i>I'm so proud of you!</i>

<i>Sending you kisses.</i>

-[bell dings]
-Another order of tacos, please.

[man singing in Spanish on soundtrack]

[inaudible dialogue]

[inaudible dialogue]

[IvÃ¡n] I like it.


Let's put these over there.
Come with me, IvÃ¡n.

IvÃ¡n, there were four.

No, only three.

When are you going
to clean everything?

-They'll do it.
-They'll clean this part.

Can you believe that Matt wanted
to remove these red lamps?

He said they were ugly.
I told him no way.

There's no bulb, IvÃ¡n.

[mellow music playing]

[keys jingling]


<i>I just left the embassy.</i>

<i>They won't give me a visa.</i>

And...

I'm tired of it, you know.
I don't know what's happening.

They won't approve me,

and they're super strict
with the papers and everything.

So that's it.

I give up.

Uh...

Are you planning on coming back?

Or are you going to stay there forever?

<i>I haven't seen you in 20 years,</i>

<i>and you know that time's passing.</i>

[tender music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

[IvÃ¡n] <i>Twenty years.</i>

<i>How many shifts?</i>

<i>I've lost count.</i>

<i>Janitor. Dishwasher.</i>

<i>Line cook.</i>

<i>Chef.</i>

<i>Owner.</i>

<i>Father.</i>

<i>Immigrant.</i>

<i>Mexican.</i>

<i>I have memories that are fading away.</i>

<i>I can't remember
the name of my dad's favorite chile.</i>

<i>What else is fading away?</i>

<i>Am I disappearing to them?</i>

And if you decide to go back to Mexico,
what will you do there?

You'd be returning to a terribly unstable
country, where there isn't any work,

where you'd have to figure out what to do.

It's like starting from scratch.

-[woman] You guys aren't open?
-[IvÃ¡n in English] Sorry. We open at 5:00.

-[woman] Oh, okay.
-[IvÃ¡n] Sorry.

IvÃ¡n...

I don't see myself living
in Mexico right now.

I just can't see it.

[dramatic music playing]

The central bus station.


Come here.


[in English] Hey.

-I just--
-[woman whoops]

I want just to be very quick, so quickly.

No, just-- You know,
I going to practice my Spanglish.

[all cheering]

So thank you so much
for being here, all of--

So many beautiful faces
since like, uh, ten years ago,

-like before the Twin Towers.
-[man] Thank you.

I can see friends, like,
when we were working together

in different restaurants,
like 12 years ago...


...cleaning tables.

And now I still cleaning tables

-but your tables!
-[crowd laughs]


[all cheering]

And we are here
because IvÃ¡n's food, I think.

[crowd cheering]

[in Spanish] Tonight...

I've achieved one of my dreams,

which is to see
this place filled with our friends.

We created this place
not just with ourselves in mind,

but thinking about the neighborhood,

thinking about our friends
and our families.

And for the Mexicans
who came here seeking opportunities.

[all cheering]

[IvÃ¡n] Thank you, thank you, thank you.

-Cheers!
<i>-Salud!</i>

[somber music playing]

[Sandra over phone]<i> Dad,
I'm making a video for IvÃ¡n.</i>

<i>Brother...</i>

<i>we're going to change rooms.
Mom already called the priest.</i>

<i>I will let you know if anything changes.</i>

[IvÃ¡n]<i> </i>This is so painful.
It's really killing me,

not being able to be there.

Not being able to say goodbye to him,
to my own father.

And, well...

[inaudible dialogue]

[congregation singing in Spanish]

[priest in Spanish] For our families
who stayed behind in our countries,

we ask you, Lord,
please don't let us forget them.

We ask that you bring hope and patience
to our illegal brothers and sisters.

Grant us the strength
to overcome the abuses of racism.

We pray to you.

Long live the Latino immigrants!


in this country!


[man singing in Spanish]

I have a son in Mexico who's 20 years old.

And so I want to travel to Mexico.
I haven't seen him in many years.

So... I don't want to leave
this country forever

because I have the businesses,
because...

I don't want to close the restaurants
and leave 80 people without a job.

I'm not asking
for residency or citizenship.

All I want is permission to travel
and return here to continue working.

[in Spanish] But even with all that,

even though you have a business
and employees...

because you entered
without documentation

and because you've been here illegally,

there's no path.

[dramatic music playing]

It's like being trapped in a cage.

Honestly, I'm not happy. I'm not.

But there are many other people, IvÃ¡n,

whose lives are destroyed...

and with much worse problems than us.

Oh, no.

There's nothing else to do but to go on.

It can't be that a country can destroy
the bond between a father and a son.

Or between a family.

I don't think it's worth it.

And it's going to split us apart.

[man speaking indistinctly
over PA in Spanish]

[IvÃ¡n] <i>Have you ever had that dream
where you're back in Mexico?</i>

<i>I have it all the time.</i>

<i>The jacaranda blossoms strewn
in the street.</i>

<i>The colors of the market.</i>

<i>I can see them.</i>

<i>It's so real.</i>

<i>There are days
when the feeling doesn't leave me.</i>

<i>I carry it with me, wherever I go.</i>

-[baby crying]
-[shushing]

<i>Sometimes I confuse
my dreams with memories.</i>

<i>Because a part of me is still there.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

<i>I don't know if destiny exists.</i>

<i>But what I do know is
that life gives us all a surprise.</i>

<i>You are my surprise.</i>

<i>And I am yours.</i>

<i>And we are here.</i>

<i>You and me.</i>

<i>Together.</i>

<i>Still dreaming.</i>
