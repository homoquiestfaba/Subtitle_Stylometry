Sit back down
and shut your trap!

It's time for "Mail Call!"

Welcome to a special high-flying
edition of "Mail Call."

Man, you're going to love this!

It's all about aircraft, airmen,
and amazing airborne stuff

up the wazoo!

Now, a while back, you might
remember that I got an offer

to go sky dive with the
United States Army Parachute

Team, the Golden Knights.

So then I got a candy-ass
email from Ken in Wyoming,

Michigan, saying, Gunny, I'll
bet you're too chicken to jump.

Well, Ken, I hope you're
ready to put your money where

your mouth is!

Because this is one bet that
I'm willing to take right now.

[music playing]

R. LEE ERMEY

when it comes to
precision parachuting,

no one does it better than the
United States Army's Golden

Knights.

These daredevils of the sky
push every jump to the limit.

They love what they do, and
they're definitely gonzo.

They perform at air
shows all over the world.

So it's no wonder that they're
America's reigning National

Sport Parachuting champions.

I caught up with
the Golden Knights

at Edwards Air Force
Base in California,

where they were getting
ready for an upcoming show.

But even a Golden Knight is
only as good as his armor.

So I wanted to get a
close look at their gear

before I took my leap.

I was all ears while Sergeant
First Class Billy Van Soelen

went over the game plan with me.

Today, we're going to be doing
what's called the tandem jump.

I'll be strapped
to him, and he'll

be strapped to the parachute.

He'll control the
one chute that'll

bring us both back to Earth.

So you're going to
hang all the way down.

Your head will be back.

At that time, I'll say, Gunny,
are you ready to skydive?

Ready to rock and roll.

Well, you'll say no, but
I'll think you're saying, go.

And I'll say, OK,
ready, set, go.

And we're going to exit the
aircraft, just like that.

All right.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
For our tandem jump,

the Sergeant will be strapping
on a semi-elliptical ram-air

parachute.

It's highly maneuverable.

Set a steering line, you
can stop it on a dime.

But it's very big,
and it will allow

the maximum suspended weight
of 500 pounds-- both of us

together.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But if for some reason

the main chute malfunctions, as
demonstrated in this air show,

we'll go to plan B.

All I did was reach down here
and grab this green handle.

You notice there's a series
of cables that come up

through these concentric
rings right here.

What will happen is as
I pull those cables,

this loop goes
through this grommet,

and these three rings
will simultaneously

fall off of one another and
jettison the main parachute

away.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
As the main chute detaches,

a safety mechanism automatically
releases a reserve chute.

This can also be done manually.

But if the release
handles crap out,

or if you're
knocked unconscious,

this pack is rigged with
another backup system,

a gizmo called the Airtec
CYPRES, or Cybernetic Parachute

Release System.

It reads barometric pressure and
speed to automatically deploy

the reserve chute.

Well, I'm ready to gear up
and head out to the tarmac.

You know what I think?

What's that, buddy?

I think we need to go do this.

What do you say?

Let's go make a skydive!

All right!

Woo!

Watch your step.

R. LEE ERMEY

that we're boarding is a
twin-prop F27 Friendship

Fokker, the Golden
Knights flagship.

It's used as both the jump
platform and to travel the team

throughout the year.

As we got close to our jump
altitude of 12,000 feet,

the Sergeant and
I got reacquainted

and snapped together
into our tandem rig.

There's no turning back now.

You'll notice I wasn't alone.

My little buddy, Mini-Lee,
wanted in on the action.

He's an adrenaline
junkie too, you know,

and he's going to jump solo.

It's go-time, Mini-Lee.

3, 2, 1--

Geronimo!

The mini-chute you
see trailing us

is called the drone pilot chute.

It's used to slow our
descent during freefall,

since us heavier tandem
guys would fall faster

than the single jumpers.

That way, we don't get
ahead of the camera man.

Well, it looks like we
won't need the reserve chute

after all.

But that ground is
coming up pretty fast.

The sarge gives me a quick
review on our landing

procedures so we can
stick this like pros.

All right, Gunny, get those
feet and knees nice and high

for me.
You got it!

There you go.

Good.

Just like that.

Just like that.

Now, remember, don't put them
down till I tell you to, OK?

OK.

You say drop them,
I got them down.

And here we go!

Not yet, not yet, not yet.

And set them!

Aah!

Yes!

Ah!

What did you think about that?

Oh, it's so quiet and
so beautiful up there.

That's a little
bit too serene.

I think it's--

I think I'm in big trouble.

That's what I think.

Because now I'm
going to have to buy

me one of these
damn things, and I'm

going to have to get involved.

Hey, Gunny--

That was--

--how was that for
being an army of one, huh?

That was a pretty
good army of one.

Yeah, baby.

That was the closest I've
been to a guy for a long time.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Well, before we packed it

in for the day, the guys had
a special surprise for me

back at the air field.

By order of the United
States Army Parachute Team,

I hereby promote you to
honorary basic parachutist.

Congratulations there, Gunny.

Well, Semper Fi.



Absolutely.

You know it may have taken
me a while to get my wings,

but it sure as hell
was worth the wait.

And as long as we're talking
Army and airplanes here,

a lot of you have been
sending in emails giving me

serious flak, and I'm
sick and tired of it.

You're whining that when I'm
talking about World War II

flyboys, I call them
the Army Air Force

when I should be calling
them the Army Air Corps.

Well, my answer to you is
stuff it up your tailpipe.

Because both are correct.

[music playing]

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): The
Army's aerial combat history

goes back to 1917 when
it entered World War I

and formed the US
Army Air Service.

Their biggest hero
was a little old ace

named Eddie Rickenbacker.

In 1926, the Air Service became
a permanent part of the Army

and was renamed
the Army Air Corps.

In June 1941, the Army
streamlined things

and merged a bunch of outfits,
including the Air Corps,

into a new unit called
the US Army Air Forces.

It wasn't until 1947 that
President Truman signed

the National Security Act,
creating a new separate branch

of the military called the
United States Air Force.

And even though
the Air Force is now

our main aerial component
in the military,

the Army never got out of the
air war business altogether.

And that's why the
only primary jump

school in the entire
United States military

is still taught by the Army.

And that should just about
answer all of your jump

questions, except for one.

Whatever happened to my
little buddy Mini-Lee?

Well, I'm expecting him
along here any minute.

Bend your knees!

Bend your knees, Mini-Lee!


Ah!

Oh, that's gotta hurt.

I got an email from Zach, who
lives in Ledyard, Connecticut.

He's asking about
the Curtiss P-40.

That's the first airplane
to take the fight directly

to the Japanese in WWII.

And, Zach, if we're
going to talk P-40s,

we gotta talk
Flying Tigers, baby.

[music playing]

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
When World War II broke out,

we needed to really crank up
our aircraft production lines.

At the time, the best
fighter plane we had

was the P-40, built by the
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.

A sturdy, low-wing
monoplane, the P-40

was powered by a 1,200
horsepower Allison engine.

It packed three 50-caliber
machine guns in each wing

and could carry
a 500-pound bomb.

It could fly at speeds
over 350 miles an hour

and as high as 32,000 feet.

During the war, we
sold or gave the P-40

to a lot of our allies.

And this war bird saw
action all over the world.

Depending on which Air
Force was flying it,

the P-40 was nicknamed the
Tomahawk, the Kitty Hawk,

or the War Hawk.

Probably the most famous
outfit to use the P-40

was the American
Volunteer Group.

But you know them as
the Flying Tigers.

These were American
pilots who had volunteered

to fight for China before the
US had even entered the war.

Early in 1941, Madam
Chiang Kai-Shek,

wife of the Chinese leader,
asked a retired US Army Air

Corps officer named
Claire Chennault

to help out and organize
a group of fighter pilots.

And since China was a key
American ally and already

at war with Japan,
President Roosevelt

signed an unpublished executive
order on April 15, 1941.

It authorized Reserve
Officers and enlisted men

to resign from the Army Air
Corps, Naval, and Marine Air

Services to form
the volunteer unit.

100 pilots and 200
ground crew members

arrived in the summer of
1941 to begin their training.

But there was one big problem.

Chennault didn't have enough
P-40s for his guys to fly.

Luckily, the airplane builders,
Curtiss-Wright, had a solution.

Since they were already
building P-40s for the British,

the folks at
Curtiss-Wright decided

that they'd give the
Brits updated P-40s

a little later so they could
get the Tigers the older P-40B's

right away.

By late December, just two
weeks after Pearl Harbor,

they were facing the Japanese
Air Force in combat operation.

Since this was the older P-40B
that the Tigers were flying,

it wasn't the best of the bunch.

They were not equipped with
a gun sight, bomb rack,

or extra fuel.

And the P-40 was not very
fast at high altitudes.

But the Flying Tiger
pilots made do.

Using the plane's low
altitude speed and stability,

Chennault trained
the Tiger Pilots

to exploit the
enemy's weaknesses

and make the best
of their equipment.

During their first
combat on December 20,

they shot down 9 out
of 10 Japanese bombers

they were targeting, while
only losing one P-40.

During another key mission
on Christmas day of 1941,

the Tigers knocked out 23
Japanese bombers and fighters

without losing one single P-40.

The Tigers also supplied
critical air cover

for forces moving
along the Burma

Road, the most vital supply line
for the allies through Asia.

When it was all over, the
total number of the Tigers

were impressive--

286 Japanese planes shot down
and only 12 Flying Tiger pilots

listed as killed or
missing in action.

Finally, the US Army Air Forces
absorbed the Flying Tigers

in 1942.

Most of the men of
the squadron stayed on

to fight in the Pacific,
and Claire Chennault

remained their leader.

He rejoined the army and earned
the rank of Major General.

By the end of the war, the
brave and skillful P-40 pilots

had shot down 650
Japanese planes.

Not bad for a team flying a
fighter that a lot of people

felt was second class.

Got an email about
an interesting bit

of Flying Tigers gear.

Dottie in St. Louis, MO, is
asking, what is a blood chit?

Well, Dottie, this
is a blood chit.

It's also known
as an escape flag.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Starting in World War II,

pilots sewed these flags
into their jackets.

If a pilot was shot down
and too injured to talk,

or didn't know the
local language,

the blood chit
would speak for him.

It let whoever found him know
that if the pilot was given

food, shelter, medical
care, and returned safely

to American hands, there'd be
a reward in it for the rescuer.

That's why it was
called a chit, which

is basic slang for an IOU.

Blood chits are still being
issued to pilots and crews

operating in hostile territory.

But just how many
blood chits, if any,

have actually been turned in?

And what kind of reward
are we talking about here?

Well, that's
strictly classified.

Not too long ago, I got an email
from Lee in Fort Walton Beach,

Florida, asking me to check
out what he calls a real war

machine, the AC-130U gunship.

And once I found out that
this baby has the biggest

gun in the sky, it was an offer
that I just couldn't refuse.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): We
hauled ass down to the Florida

panhandle to visit Hurlburt
Field, home of the Air Force's

16th Special Operations Wing
and the 4th Special Operations

Squadron.

The men and women of the 4th
SOS are known as ghost riders.

And the AC-130U gunship
they fly is dubbed "Spooky."

Spooky's job is
to help the grunts

on the ground with close
air support firepower

and armed reconnaissance.

With a 25-millimeter
Gatling gun,

40-millimeter rapid-fire cannon,
and a 105-millimeter Howitzer

mounted under the left wing,
Spooky circles the target

like a big dark cloud
hurling a hail storm of lead.

Spooky is a converted Lockheed
C-130 Hercules Assault

Transport.

The airframe hasn't changed
much since the first C-130s

of the 1950s.

But on the inside,
the AC-130U hauls

one of the most complex aircraft
weapons systems in the world.

JASON BUSS: We're able to
literally put her rounds

within meters, or
feet, of the target.

And we can engage
relatively safe distance

to the friendly forces and
without risk of endangering

them.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But don't expect

Spooky to win any air races.

It's big and slow.

And that's just the
way they want it.

When a fighter
might come in and be

able to make a quick pass
and look at something,

we can literally stay
on station for hours.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But since it is slow,

the AC-130U might make an
easy target in the daytime.

That's why it flies nearly
all its missions after dark.

JASON BUSS: No lights on at all,
not in the cockpit or anything.

We fly on night vision goggles.

So we do our job, basically,
off very small chem lights,

just knowing where the guns are.

It can be very hectic.

But we were very well trained in
what we do, and we do it a lot.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
And what they do the most

is kick butt with
their 3-gun system.

This is our number
one gun position.

Basically, this is our
25-millimeter Gatling gun.

Fires 1,800 shots per minute,
plus it lasts 100 rounds.

This is a good
psychological weapon

because it has a mass
amount of rounds going out

at a high rate of fire,
basically saturating the area

where the enemy's at.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): On
the early gun ships dating back

to the Vietnam War,
the guns were fixed

to the side of the plane,
and the pilot aimed them

by maneuvering the
entire aircraft.

Today, Spooky's guns are
on hydraulic mounts, guided

by some sophisticated
sensors and sights.

This is our number two gun.

It's a 40-millimeter
Bofors cannon.

This gives us a little bit more
capability on larger targets.

Each round weighs
about five pounds.

Rapid fire-- this is
going to be firing

about 100 shots per minute.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Not enough firepower for you?

Then check this out.

These flyboys have a
frigging cannon on board!

This is our number
three gun position.

It's 105-millimeter Howitzer.

Basically, it's the same
gun that the army uses.

We've just adapted it
towards the aircraft.

We're requiring a longer recoil.

We can sustain a rate of fire
around 10 rounds a minute.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
In action, an AC-130

can be a pretty chaotic place,
with guns firing and bent

casings bouncing
all over the deck.

And things can get even
crazier for the gunners

when the pilot has to
dodge incoming fire.

If we get engaged, our primary
concern is to hug the round,

guard the primer, and hit
the ground, basically kind

of putting ourself as a
buffer between the primer

and the aircraft.

I know lots of individuals
that have actually

had broken wrist, broken
hands, protecting a round.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Beginning with their rapid fire

introduction in
Vietnam, these gun ships

have seen action in just
about every US engagement

since, including operations
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

And there is no doubt that
enemies all over the world

know the AC-130's reputation
as a ghostly gunslinger.

A lot of times, just the
noise of a C-130 is enough that

the enemy will not do anything.

It stays pretty quiet
when we're overhead.

So a lot of times,
the ground users

will like to have us
just overhead, just

to make some noise.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
You might just

say that old Spooky can scare
away the bad guys by just

showing up and saying, boo!

I like the squadron's
unofficial motto--

"You can run, but
you only die tired."

Ooh-rah.

Spooky may be America's
primo night fighter,

but it wasn't the first
one, not by a long shot.

This distinction goes
to the P-61 Black Widow.

And Thomas in Rock
Springs, Wyoming

shot me an email asking,
what was the P-61 used for?

Now, that's an easy one.

The Black Widow's
primary mission

was whoopass after dark.

R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): In
1943, the Northrop Aircraft

Company rolled out the P-61
Black Widow, the country's

first plane specifically
designed as a night fighter.

Now, you need a hell
of a lot of cojones

to fly these honeys after dark.

Remember, this was in the days
before night vision goggles

and thermal sights.

The key to its success
was a new radar

in the nose that helped
the three-man crew find

their targets.

The Black Widow packed four
50-caliber machine guns

in a top turret and four
20-millimeter cannons

in the belly.

Most were painted black so the
enemy search lights couldn't

pick them out.

You might say the Black Widow
was our very first stealth

fighter.

Well, we've gotten a look at
a hell of a lot of war birds

and flyboy gear
this time around.

But the thing I keep
thinking is how none of it

would've been possible without
the brains, dedication,

and just plain
grit of our troops.

It's people, not
just planes, that

keep us flying and fighting.

Semper Fi.

Carry on.

I got an email from Lee
in Fort Walton bea--

be-- be-- be-- Florida.


I got an offer to go skydiving
with the United States Marine

Corps--

Marine Corps?


You know, it may--

let me start that over again.

I took a big damn
beat right there

and almost started
talking too early.
