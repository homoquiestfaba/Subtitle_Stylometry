Bradley Darnell Lyle!

[loud knocking]

<i>If you don't drag your
sorry bronkie ass out here</i>

<i>in real time, right now...</i>


<i>I'm a beat you like
you stole something.</i>

Fuck, momma!

Don't "fuck momma" me!

I'll "fuck momma" you,
all right!

I'm coming!

<i>You think I enjoy
being on neurontin?</i>

<i>You think I love my seizures?</i>

You think I enjoy
having you drive me

from point A to point B'?

Damn!
Show me some courtesy!

Courtesy'?

I'll show you South Central.

Why you always
busting on me'?

What the hell you up to, boy'?
Stop!

Move out the way.

Just reading the damn news.

Don't think I don't know
the power of the back button.

C'mon, mama.

<i>(voice on computer) ...the
world's best gay porn site...</i>

Your father
would have killed himself

if he hadn't done so already.

Well, it's a good thing
he ain't here then.

Get off my shit before I--

Before you what'?

Before you fuck me up?


Get off...
my shit, bitch!

Is that the way you speak
to the one who raised you'?

I give what I get.

Uh uh...

I won't have none of this,
or this gay shit in my house.

Get out!
What?

You heard me.

Now get your shit.

Think you can just erase me?

You can kick me out,
you can say I'm dead to you,

make me live
on the damn street.

But I'll never be gone.
You hear what I'm sayin?

What's the last thing
you want to say to me

before I walk out that door?

You're a loser.

Always have been,
always will be, right?

â™ª

Brad!

You can't take my car!

Watch me!

â™ª Lost my sister
when she was six â™ª

â™ª Anything that's broke
is something I can't fix â™ª

â™ª I'm an empty bag
in a bag of tricks â™ª

â™ª I'm a loser â™ª

â™ª Lost my job
at the shopping mall â™ª

â™ª Lost my cherry
down in Juvy Hall â™ª

â™ª Why stand up when
you know you'll fall'? â™ª

â™ª I'm a loser â™ª

â™ª Ain't no way
for a man to exist â™ª

â™ª My whole life's one
big cease and desist â™ª

â™ª But there's one thing
that you may have missed â™ª

â™ª It's just another check â™ª

â™ª On the loser's list â™ª

â™ª It's just another check â™ª

â™ª On the loser's list... â™ª

â™ª Poppa hung himself
in county jail â™ª

â™ª Momma always telling him
that he would fail â™ª

â™ª There's no way a guy
like him could prevail â™ª

â™ª He was a loser â™ª

â™ª I lost my apartment
when I couldn't pay rent â™ª

â™ª Just another step
in my long descent â™ª

â™ª Certain circumstances
I could never circumvent â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I'm a loser â™ª

â™ª It's a wonder
I can even subsist â™ª

â™ª I think on my feet
and I act with my fist â™ª

â™ª Anybody else would
need a little assist â™ª

â™ª But for me
it's just another check â™ª

â™ª On the loser's list â™ª

â™ª It's just another check â™ª

â™ª On the loser's list â™ª

So what's your name?

What's yours'?

I'm Brad.

Folks must call you
Bad Brad.

Why's that'?

I don't know.
I guess it just suits you.

Yeah...

So, where you going later?

â™ª Living ain't so easy â™ª

â™ª Just can't get it right â™ª

â™ª Wonder how I'll make it
through another night â™ª

â™ª So make sure your money
is in your plain sight â™ª

â™ª I'm a loser â™ª

Hey!!!

â™ª I think by now
you get the gist â™ª

â™ª I'm just a little scammer â™ª

â™ª I just can't resist â™ª

â™ª Most people
cannot handle fate â™ª

â™ª That comes with a twist â™ª

â™ª But for me
it's just another check â™ª

â™ª On the loser's list â™ª

Excuse me.

Back up.

Thank you.

$25 after 12.

Back up.

So what are you walking?

Sex siren'?

What?

Never mind.

Go inside, have fun.

Welcome.

â™ª It's just another check
On the loser's list â™ª

â™ª Ballroom bliss â™ª

You all live here'?

Nope...

Just the outcasts, freaks,
and temporarily displaced.


Omon. This way.

Nah. This ain't right.

What's wrong?

You don't want a nice, warm
body up against you tonight?

[knocking on bed]

What it do?

Can't you see
we're trying to sleep?

Yeah, girl.
What it do'?

I'm sleeping for two,
mind you.

Go back to sleep.

Brad, y'all met each other
at the ball.

This here is Duke Eminence.

He's royalty, honey.

Eppie Durall, also of
the House of Eminence.

Like that shit they give you

when you're about
to have a baby'?

Yes, ma'am!
The natural Way's for fools.

This bitch thinks she
got a uterus or something.

So are you gonna like have
an operation or something'?

Now why would
I need two pussies?

[all chuckling]

But mark my words...

I am gonna
pop out some kids

and have a family of my own,
you'll see.

You planning on shooting
those fools out of your ass'?

Who cares, as long as
I get my pain meds'?

What it do'?

If I had a quarter for every
time you all said "What it do?"

Honey, it ain't
just an expression.

"What it do?"
It's a way of life.

Something tells me
you've seen "The Lion King"

one too many times.

You heard that!

You tired'?
Yeah.

He staying over'?

Yeah.

He can't stay here, Princess.
There ain't no room.

Besides, you know
what Queef would say.

She'd go,
"There ain't no stray men--"

There ain't no stray men
allowed in my house.

Is that what I'd say'?

Uh...

Princess, may I have
a word with you'?

Your guest
can wait outside.

Outside'?

Mmm hmm. Go on.

Look at my face!

Does it look like
I'm in any mood'?

Go on.
Kitchen, girl!

[claps hands]

Ea t, girl.
Seem' your bones again.

<i>Now, you ready
for my question?</i>

Yes, mother.

Did you get
your tens tonight'?

<i>I'm sorry'?</i>

Did you get your tens'?

Why you go asking me that when
you already know the answer?

Don't make mother
ask you again.

No.
No, what'?

No, Mother.
And?

And what'?

The correct answer is,

"No, mother, I didn't
get my tens tonight,

<i>because I was kee-keeing
with my Judys,</i>

and chasing the mens."

You're just jealous because
you don't even remember

what it's like to walk.

It's OK;
the body forgets.

Don't comfort me, girl.
Answer me.

I wasn't chasing no mens.

Really?
No lying,

You had a man
lying in your bed

and you lying
to my face right now.

Seems like a lot of
lying going on.

You got this all wrong.

Excuse me'?

She was just recruiting me...

Miss Queef.

Ma'am.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me'?

I was glistening.

Glistening'?

Gay listening.

You know, when you're
talking to one man

and you see another
over his shoulder,

but you're not really
paying attention

to what the first one
has to say.

Glistening.

Didn't I tell him
to wait outside?

It's my fault.

Just wanted to try
and clear this mess up...

Miss Queef.
Miss Queef'?

What are you'?
Some Koreatown grocer'?

Miss Queef'?

It's Queef Latina
when I'm all up in it,

or Franklin or Mother
at other times.

But never ever Miss Queef!

Besides...
glistening here!

I'm sorry.
I should say so.

You ain't you got
no place to stay'?

No Ma'am.
My Mom--

Oh save it with
"my mom" stories.

We all got one.

I do not trust this man.

He's harmless,
and hot, mind you.

What do you want
with my daughter?

Your daughter'?
It's just a figure of speech.

Oh, OK, I thought
you was saying, like,

you was married or--

I ask the questions here.

Oh, just tell him.

Well, I am married,
if it's any business of yours.

No ring?

It's pending.

I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

Let him stay!
He can sleep on the couch.

This house is for
serious walkers only.

Not for some
candy-assed, Sex Siren wannabe.

You think he can
walk Sex Siren'?

Hmmmph.

Frankly, I think
that's all he can do.

Well, give him a chance.

You want a roof
over your head'?

You have to earn it.

He's only got his car.
Then the car it is!

It's cool.

Go on!

I'm sorry to disturb you.

That's right.

Eat.

I'

â™ª Taught myself to be â™ª

â™ª Strong as can be â™ª

â™ª Holding on to
my dignity â™ª

â™ª Walk into a room â™ª

â™ª Can't help but hold
my head high â™ª

â™ª I can read a book
off its page â™ª

â™ª Throw a little shade
from the stage â™ª

â™ª Look a million
making minimum wage â™ª

â™ª But I'm weak
at the knees â™ª

â™ª When I'm with you... â™ª

â™ª I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To dial back a little â™ª

â™ª I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To be
a tad noncommittal â™ª

â™ª I'm willing to wait â™ª

â™ª I've circled the date â™ª

â™ª Of the next time
I'll see your face â™ª

â™ª Once again... â™ª

â™ª I remember when
we first met â™ª

â™ª It's a moment
I can't forget â™ª

â™ª You smiled at me â™ª

â™ª And my whole world
just got smaller â™ª

â™ª Oh, the nights when â™ª

â™ª You took me out â™ª

â™ª Roll the window
down and shout â™ª

â™ª "That's the stuff
I'm talkin' 'bout" â™ª

â™ª You're the light â™ª

â™ª In the darkest of worlds â™ª

â™ª I'm a lucky girl â™ª

â™ª Yes, I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To wait a bit longer â™ª

â™ª I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To be a bit stronger â™ª

â™ª I'm willing you, dear, â™ª

â™ª That you'll reappear â™ª

â™ª And treat me like
the Queen that I am â™ª

â™ª Once again... â™ª

Sign in.
Put the time right there.

What time is it'?

Do I look like a clock'?

Visitation's almost up.
Who you here to see'?

Caldwell Jones.

Caldwell Jones'?

Heh, heh, heh...

What's that supposed to mean'?

I'm just surprised that someone
actually came to see him

that ain't got
an esquire after their name.

I'm here every week.

Well, I'll be good goddamned.

Now how could
I have missed you'?

Caldwell Jones is the sweetest
person you'll ever meet.

Besides, if we all
followed our heads

instead of our hearts,
you'd be plum out of a job.

You're late.

Ain't never been a ball
that started on time...

<i>You know what I'm sewn"?</i>

So what's the T, babydoll'?

No!

Ain't gonna be none
of that babydoll shit, OK'?

Everything OK'?

Yeah.

I'm gettin' out
in two more weeks,

<i>you know what I'm sewn"?</i>

Time's gonna
fly by before you know it.

Bitch, you ain't never
done time before,

or else you'd know different.

Sorry.

It's cool.

I ain't even mad about that.

Six months...

and it all comes down
to fourteen days.

Two more weeks.

Then you're all mine.

No, baby...

In two more weeks,
you're all mine.

I'

â™ª Every time â™ª

â™ª I take a look
in your eyes â™ª

â™ª Just a little
part of me dies â™ª

â™ª It's a thought
that I can't disguise â™ª

â™ª But I keep
coming back here for more â™ª

â™ª Tell me, honey, â™ª

â™ª When you look
into my face â™ª

â™ª ls there something else
in its place'? â™ª

â™ª Other than a smile
filled with grace â™ª

â™ª It enrages you â™ª

â™ª When it should be
engaging you... â™ª

â™ª Yet, I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To carry on like before â™ª

â™ª I'm willing â™ª

â™ª To be the one you adore â™ª

â™ª I'm willing to try â™ª

â™ª To keep the shine
in my eye â™ª

â™ª If you treat me good â™ª

â™ª I won't be misunderstood â™ª

â™ª Just be sweet to me
like you should... â™ª

<i>Â£82...â€œ</i>

IWilling... â™ª

Hey!

Let's go. You coming'?

Coming where'?

Does it matter'?

Wherever we're going's gotta
be better than here, right'?

Let's go. Move it.

Here you go.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

So, why aren't you doing me'?

I'm not doing anybody.

God, don't tell me you're
one of those slow movers.

You should be doing me,
that's all I'm sayin'.

Now why is that'?

'Cause I got a future.

I'm going places.

Future what'?

Don't try it.

I've got skills most
bitches only dream about.

Like what'?

Like I can move.

And better than that,

I can teach others
how to move.

Like one of them
striptease teachers?

Striptease teacher'?

I swear that when I get
that Legend trophy,

Justin Timberlake
will be calling me

to choreograph
his next video.

Yeah, um hmm.

Laugh now, but you'll
be eating my stuff later.

L-low is Justin Timberlake
gonna know about you'?

Everybody's gonna
know about me.

I have a plan.

â™ª Now see,
Justin is everything! â™ª

â™ª I love his butt,
his clutch, â™ª

â™ª His lips, his hips â™ª

â™ª Just wait till
he sees all of this â™ª

â™ª Nothing will be sweeter â™ª

â™ª Sweeter at all â™ª

â™ª You watch â™ª

â™ª My life will change the
very second Justin calls... â™ª

â™ª Look at how I roll â™ª

â™ª I got your attention â™ª

â™ª In complete control â™ª

IAnd I ain't

through the wall â™ª

â™ª Justin's gonna call, yeah â™ª

â™ª He's gonna call â™ª

â™ª Don't look perplexed â™ª

â™ª Justin's gonna call â™ª

[cell phone ringing]

See?

Hello'?

Uh...

Hi, Mamma Queef.


Punk-assed bitch!

Your mamma a bitch!

[clang of bowling ball
striking pins]

Shoe man! Shoe man!

Now, Eppie Durall,
you play nice.

Fuck that shit.
They better have my shoes.

Size 12, extra wide.

Saved 'em for ya.

Ooh, my future husband.

Marry me now so we can
start having my kids.

Looks like you already
started without me.

Ooh, Daddy.
Why are we bowling?

You do realize I'm a former
NCAA champion, don't you'?

Work it, bitch!


NCAA, huh'?

Yeah, Nigga Challenged
As an Athlete!


Carter, right'?

Bad Brad.

L-low much you get from me'?

L-low much
did you get from me'?

You first.
No, you first.

Same time.

Forty dollars.

Well, I guess we're even.

I guess.
Here's your wallet.

Here's your little purse.

What's the goo goo
ga ga, bitches'?

This meeting is
now called to order.

Duke!

NOW!

OK, listen up.

What is he doing here'?

Let him stay.

I didn't ask you.

I wanna walk Sex Siren.

Really?

You think it's that simple'?

You think you can waltz
right in here and bleed talent?

You besmirch all the names
that came before you.

Oh, Mother,
don't be so dramatic.

It's like you're living
in a movie

where you get to say
all the best lines.

IAM living in a movie

where I get to say
all the best lines!

And don't think for a minute

I didn't plan
for the word "besmirch"

to come screaming
and rolling off my tongue.

Come on!

I just wanna get
drunk off his junk!

I mean,
look at his bubble butt!

I wouldn't know
about such things.

My sweet husband is coming
home in two weeks, y'all.

And this guy...um...

Brad.
Brad here.

If he's so for real,
why isn't he walking for me'?

Mother has no time
for conversation.

Get it started!

Mmm hmm...

He's got the Dayum factor.

Back off! He is mine!

Are you for real'?

It's not good, right'?

Let's put it this way.

Willie Ninja would be
headspinning in his grave.

God rest his soul.

Um hmm.

Teach me then.

I'm here to learn
from the best.

Aren't you the smooth one'?

What makes you think
you are worth my time'?

I did not win 17 titles,

36 exemplary ribbons,

and a mention
in BLK magazine

by just sittin' on my ass!

Fan off your pussies, ladies.

We have two weeks
until the Imperial Mini Ball

and I want to see
trophies on that mantel.

Somebody get me an oil can
because my lady is rusty.

I wanna see someone
from Eminence

walking in every category.

Check off
your specialties, people.

Ivy League Schoolboy.

Wall Street
Executive Realness.

And Open To All
Runway With A Gaga Twist.

We all know which category
has my name on it...

Motherfuckin' Face.

[fingers snapping]

There's still shopping, sewing,
and bedazzling to be done,

and we are going into this ball
with honor and respect.

Are we clear'?

Yes, Mother.

Good. Any questions'?

<i>Emma.</i>

So, what happens if I
go into labor during the ball'?


If that happens, honey,

get me a tent,
because that means

frogs have come down
from the sky

and I need protective shelter.


Any other questions'?

Yes'?

Why y'all have
your meetings here'?

Excuse me'?

You can't bowl, <i>so...</i>

Why you all come here'?

Listen, Mr. Man Candy.

You need to look at
the world with a different eye.

Here you may see
a humble bowling alley.

But not us.

Can I get a beat, please'?

[percussive beat]

â™ª

â™ª When you're sitting
in a setting â™ª

â™ª That doesn't quite
sit right with you â™ª

â™ª When you're flitting
and forgetting â™ª

â™ª You've got a different
point of view â™ª

â™ª It's befitting
that I'm betting â™ª

â™ª You would all get
in a stew â™ª

â™ª But when you find
yourself in a place... â™ª

â™ª That's not exactly
a perfect space... â™ª

â™ª You simply do
a quick about-face â™ª

â™ª And knock
the motherfukkas down â™ª

â™ª Knock the motherfukkas down â™ª

â™ª Knock the motherfukkas down

â™ª Knock the mothers
down, down, down, down â™ª

â™ª

â™ª If you're dejected
it's expected â™ª

â™ª You will cry
a little while â™ª

â™ª But when affected
I've detected â™ª

â™ª You must force a smile â™ª

â™ª To stay connected
and respected â™ª

â™ª And retain
your sense of style â™ª

â™ª It's best to take
a breath of fresh air... â™ª

â™ª And hold yourself
with flash and flair... â™ª

â™ª Add a heap
of devil-may-care â™ª

â™ª And knock
the motherfukkas down â™ª

â™ª Knock the motherfukkas down â™ª

â™ª Knock the mothers
down, down, down, down â™ª

â™ª Down, down,
down, down, down, down... â™ª

â™ª Feast your eyes
upon the man over there â™ª

â™ª Too much product
in his hair â™ª

â™ª And his
"Please look at me!" wife â™ª

â™ª It's a low rise,
butt-cracked life, honey â™ª

â™ª l-low 'bout the girl
with the hoops â™ª

â™ª In capri pants
with droops'? â™ª

â™ª Take a gander at the
homie with his thugs â™ª

â™ª On their cellies,
moving drugs â™ª

â™ª They cut faggots
like us for a dollar â™ª

â™ª It's enough to
make you wanna holler â™ª

â™ª Now close your eyes for me â™ª

â™ª Imagine the possibility â™ª

â™ª If you look less carefully â™ª

â™ª Then I guarantee
you'll see â™ª

â™ª An adoring audience
for free â™ª

â™ª [rhythmic clapping] â™ª

â™ª If you wanna be
a Sex Siren of this town â™ª

â™ª Oil that body up and pull
your pants way down â™ª

â™ª This is your new life now â™ª

â™ª Wipe off that
sorry-assed frown â™ª

â™ª Hold the trophy
in your hand â™ª

â™ª And with
a B-Boy stance â™ª

â™ª You'll snatch the crown â™ª

â™ª And knock... â™ª

<i>â™ª Say what'? I</i>

â™ª I said KNOCK, KNOCK! â™ª

<i>â™ª Knock what'? I</i>

â™ª Knock the motherfukkas down

â™ª Knock the mothers
down, down, down, down â™ª

â™ª Knock the
motherfukkas down... â™ª

â™ª Knock the mothers
down, down, down, down â™ª

â™ª Just hold your head
up in the air â™ª

â™ª No looking at your feet â™ª

â™ª Cross your arms
from here to there â™ª

â™ª Just pay attention â™ª

â™ª Baby, I swear â™ª

â™ª You're gonna knock
the motherfukkas down â™ª

â™ª Down, down
down, down, down... â™ª

â™ª

If you're expecting
to have a prayer

of getting into this house,

you're gonna have
to work for your supper.

And no sex with nobody,
you hear'?

Yeah.
Promise me.

I promise.

Sweet Jesus,
I have a feeling

I'm gonna regret
knowing this guy.

â™ª [music stinger] â™ª

Boo!


Oh, no!
You should have seen your face!

L-low did you get in here'?

As Mother always says,

any girl can lick cocks,
but it takes a special one

who can kick locks,
all right'?

You know, you can get
what you want

if you know what you want.

I just thought you might be
wanting some private lessons.

Come on, you gotta put
some effort into it.

I am!

All right. Let me see it.

Okay, that sucks.

You gotta lead with your dick.
Like this...

Nice.

[both chuckling]

Brother's got potential.

Oh, man.

Hands above your head.

Hot.

Not.

I wanna show you something.

Sure.

This is beautiful.

How'd you find it'?

Excuse me'?

Another person here.

Hello.

You really wanna hear
about my shitty life'?

Howl sometimes come up here
and think about ending it'?

Whoa!

Did you bring me up here
to have a pity party'?

I thought this was a date.

Besides, why would you
wanna ruin

a perfectly good sidewalk'?

This is how
this is gonna work.

We'll vibe for a while.

And it'll be feeling good.

We'll be hanging out,

spending nights together,

and you'll be thinking

you're really
feeling me or something.

All flowers and shit
sprouting from your mind.

Next thing,

you know you're thinking
we married,

some house in Baldwin Hills

with a big, nasty dog
circling the yard,

keeping us safe 2417.

That ain't the way it is.

Oh, no'?

Some fucked up
thing will happen,

or I'll mess you up.

Or one day,
I'll just come up here and...

<i>You know what I'm sewn'.</i>

Sugar, you know what
your problem is'?

Your mind is racing way
ahead of your body,

and you ain't got nobody
to look after you.

So hear me out.

â™ª

â™ª Don't jump, baby â™ª

â™ª It's a bad slump, maybe â™ª

â™ª A kiss from me would
set you right â™ª

â™ª You've had
a tough run, honey â™ª

â™ª Your tank is low on funny â™ª

â™ª Your halo
musta lost its light â™ª

â™ª Don't look down, sweetie â™ª

â™ª Let's formulate a treaty â™ª

â™ª Promise me
you'll stay up here â™ª

â™ª I prefer you living â™ª

â™ª Death is cruel
and unforgiving â™ª

â™ª It messes
with the atmosphere â™ª

â™ª Some say my hips
are like a snake, it's true â™ª

â™ª I slither, rattle, quiver,
and I shake for you â™ª

â™ª Who could resist â™ª

â™ª When you're right
in the midst â™ª

â™ª Of my beauty'? â™ª

â™ª That's right â™ª

â™ª You're drawn to me â™ª

â™ª Gone to me â™ª

â™ª Almost a pawn to me â™ª

â™ª I insist â™ª

â™ª Ooh, that this â™ª

â™ª ls your duty â™ª

Whatever you say.

Good.

â™ª Cuz I say... â™ª

â™ª Don't jump, baby â™ª

â™ª It's a speedbump, maybe â™ª

â™ª The road is gonna
clear up now â™ª

â™ª It's our time, lover â™ª

â™ª The moment to discover â™ª

â™ª The truth inside
our hearts somehow â™ª

â™ª If I stay here, deary â™ª

â™ª I'm a little weary â™ª

â™ª Things will turn
from bad to worse â™ª

â™ª At the risk
of sounding cheery â™ª

â™ª Take a listen to my theory â™ª

â™ª You'll never look good
in a hearse â™ª

â™ª You'll say my outlook
is too dark â™ª

â™ª Likely my bite
is worse than my bark â™ª

â™ª Oh, I'm damaged,
it's true â™ª

â™ª Got more baggage than you â™ª

â™ª I'm pathetic â™ª

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª It's an easy way out â™ª

â™ª It's the end,
there's no doubt â™ª

â™ª No more sadness â™ª

â™ª Nothing but gladness â™ª

â™ª But it'd just be my luck â™ª

â™ª I'd hit that and get stuck â™ª

â™ª And be forced to
continue life's madness â™ª

â™ª Then don't jump... â™ª

â™ª Don't jump... â™ª

<i>â™ª Hey! â™ª</i>

â™ª

â™ª Then don't jump, baby â™ª

â™ª OK â™ª

â™ª I won't jump, maybe â™ª

â™ª I'll find myself
another view â™ª

â™ª That's exactly
what you'll do â™ª

And together
we'll get through somehow â™ª

So, do I win'?

Win what'?

The Battle for Brad.

There's a battle'?

You think
I don't notice Princess

grinding every which way
up on you'?

She ain't you.

Good...

'Cuz I'm here to tell her,
"Back off girl, that's my man!"

And what's she gonna say back'?

Congratulations.

[drum cadence]

â™ª

[cell phone ringing]

Hello'?

Hello'?
Who's answering my phone'?

Three guesses...

And it ain't Timberland
or Lil' Wayne.

Is this Brad'?

Thank goodness
you found my phone.

Can you bring it over'?

<i>- Right now?
Yeah.</i>

Um, Queef's not home yet,

<i>and a shower
would do you good</i>

<i>before tonight's ball.</i>

I mean, it don't
bother me none,

but you gotta know Carter
does not like it ripe.

Still trying to
get me naked, huh'?

Come around back.

And bring my cell!

'Cuz Justin might call'?

<i>Bitch!</i>

HEY.
HEY.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

<i>Hurry up, y'all.
We're gonna be late for tonight.</i>

<i>Now is this one too matronly?</i>

<i>Too matronly?</i>

You wanna have a child, girl'?

There ain't no such
thing as too matronly.

I say go all slutty
if you wanna pull it off.

Pull it off?
I'm a win this bitch, honey!

Mama's home.

Hey, Mama.

Where's Princess'?

Dayum.

You hiding
a respirator under there'?

Why's that'?

Because I think I just
forgot how to breathe.

So...

Carter, Carter, Carter.

Yes.

Look, I know you're all sweet
on Miss Perfect and everything,

but, really, what are you
getting out of it'?

Some tongue'?
A little oral, maybe'?

It's none of your business.

You're right.

I forgot about her gag reflex.

And she's a spitter.
Trust.

You're scary.

Uh huh. Yeah.

And you're a man with needs.

And I like to help the needy.

No sex. Remember'?

I promised.

Of course.

No sex...

Just a little tension release.

You know...

think of it as a, uh...

a lap dance...

with benefits.

We won't talk about this
when we're done.

We won't talk about it now.

Just shut up,
and let me do this.

That Brad ain't
nothing but trouble.

I can sense these things, OK'?

This coming from someone
who got themself a man

who does time after time
after time'?

Oh! She tried it?
She tried it.

Maybe I'm just
dangerously in love.

Maybe you're just
dangerously a fool.


Princess'?

Princess, open this
damn door now!


<i>Don't make me ask you again!</i>

Break it down!

Do what'?

Break it down!

Ugh...

Again!

I hurt my shoulder.

Giving birth
will hurt more.

Push!

Push!

Damn!

Girl, we've been
hollering for you.

We're just
getting ready in here.

What'd you have
the door locked for'?

Move!

You promised me!

I swear we ain't do nothing.

I can smell her all over you.

She ain't you!

Ain't that what you said'?

She ain't you!

You're a loser!

I should have let you jump.

You're probably right.

The House of Eminence
isn't a place for trash.

Good, because this trash
was tired

of feeding the roaches
around here anyway.

Going somewhere'?

We're leaving.

See how you do
without the best of the best.

See how you do without
a roof over your head.

And we'll be just fine.

Princess, Queef...

Let's just all work this out.
Girl, you can't leave.

Princess, we need you.

We do'?
I don't recall saying that shit.

You know what your problem is'?

You don't let people be human.

And you know what your
motherfucking problem is'?

You're not much of one.

Fuck you, bitch!
We're leaving.

No!
Queef, tell her you're sorry.

Just tell her that you're upset.

Mama, we can't lose her.

This is my house!
We do what I say!

You brought all this upon us.

You ain't been nothing
but bad news

ever since you brought your
sorry black ass up in here.

Get outta my house!

<i>Oman Brad.</i>

Don't be sad, girl.

When you're chopped,
you're chopped.

Let's go, Brad.

So where we gonna go now'?

Don't you worry about that.

Princess always has
a backup plan.

Come on now.

Get your boots back, ladies.

We have a ball to bang.

[driving beat]

This is Imperial!

Bitches to the floor!

I can't believe you want

â™ª This is my lament â™ª

â™ª This is my lament â™ª

â™ª This is my lament â™ª

Ooh, my dogs are tired.

Tired'?

You got chopped
in three seconds.

Your dogs never woke up.

Remember, I'm walking
for two now.

You do realize
you're a man, right'?

Oh, hush.

He ain't coming back.

Haven't you
figured that out by now'?

You ended it.
Mind your own business.

All right, but somebody
has to tell you how it is.

Well, it ain't gotta
be you now, does it'?

This is all just
coming from my heart.

The same heart that fell for
a man who ain't no different'?

No thank you.

Mother knows best, I guess.

I just figured
we could commiserate.

Commiserate?

Now there's
a three-dollar word.

Are you OK'?

Don't ask me,
and I won't ask you.

What time is it'?

Too late to look,
too early to matter.

Thanks again
for this, Christina.

You're welcome.

Goodnight.
Goodnight.

She got you pretty good, huh'?

Yeah. Am I gonna
need stitches'?

Nah.

It's just a little cat scratch.

What?

What?

Why you
looking at me like that'?

I'm not looking at you
like anything.

Good.

Cuz, everything
I touch turns to shit.

Then what'd you touch
my face for'?

You calling me shitface?

Look...

just don't fall for me,

<i>know what I'm sewn"?</i>

I'

â™ª If you find
you're thinking about me â™ª

â™ª You should turn
and walk away â™ª

â™ª 'Cuz I'll make you cry â™ª

â™ª And you won't know why â™ª

â™ª You'll be hurt
before the end of day â™ª

â™ª I'm just not sure
what I'll do with you â™ª

â™ª One minute up
the next one down â™ª

â™ª Then you will turn
and say â™ª

â™ª Bitch, get up out my way â™ª

â™ª It's just a matter of time â™ª

Naw, babe, that ain't it.

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª When a push
can turn into a shove â™ª

â™ª Call the cops â™ª

â™ª Or write the Gov â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

It's just black love'?

It's just what'?

Nigga, what the fuck
you talking of'?

Now see,

you pulling shit right
out of your own butt

about this thing
called black love.

I'

â™ª I used to love the way
he touched me â™ª

â™ª Safe in his arms
at night â™ª

â™ª His breath upon my neck â™ª

â™ª Gave my cheek
a little peck â™ª

â™ª It was just bliss
until the morning light â™ª

â™ª But now his hands
are curled up tightly â™ª

â™ª The simmer's turned
into a boil â™ª

â™ª Nobody gets the rage â™ª

â™ª Of a black man
that's at his age â™ª

â™ª Trying to stake his claim
upon this soil â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª There are bruises
covered by a glove â™ª

â™ª There are pressures
coming from above â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª I thought I finally
found my prince â™ª

â™ª One kiss
and he became a frog â™ª

â™ª But still I pursue him â™ª

â™ª Stick just like glue to him â™ª

â™ª We need a way
to feel like we belong â™ª

â™ª l-low can I get this across'? â™ª

â™ª Most folks
don't understand â™ª

â™ª There's love in a slap â™ª

â™ª In a kick, in a punch â™ª

â™ª There's love
in the back of a hand â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª Ain't no Valentine
or cooing doves â™ª

â™ª Sure ain't the fairy tale
that I dreamed of â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

It's just black love'?

Naw, nigga, it's just black.

â™ª It's just my luck â™ª

â™ª I'd meet a man
who'd rather sing than fuck â™ª

â™ª If you don't make a move
I'd say we're stuck â™ª

â™ª There ain't no love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It can sometimes
end up being rough â™ª

â™ª Even kisses
are a little tough â™ª

â™ª It's black love â™ª

Jesus, I've had enough!

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª Black love
is what I choose â™ª

â™ª Something tells me
that I'm gonna lose â™ª

â™ª Ain't like it'd ever
make the news â™ª

<i>â™ª How l love â™ª</i>

â™ª How l love... â™ª

â™ª Black Love â™ª

I don't know about this.

About what'?

About this...
going deep.

Honey, I don't do deep.

I'm the fun
on the way to deep, right'?

So we cool'?

God only knows what
you see in her, but...

Whatever.

No flowers'?

Is Carter here'?

She don't wanna see you.

I just wanna apologize.

I really screwed this up.

I just wanna do right by her.

Well, take some
motherly advice then.

You can't apologize

without a little something
in your hands.

What it do'?

I like you.

I don't know why, but...

Me, Carter and Duke,

we're heading to the Quick Mart
in about half an hour.

Beat us there,
and buy her something!

I don't think they have
flowers at the Quick Mart.

Get her candy, cigarettes.

Buy her a Slim Jim!
Who cares'?

As long as you got something
in your hands, nigga!

<i>Eppie! Now!</i>

Ooh, shit, gotta go!

Delivery for Carter Eminence.

Any one of you Carter Eminence'?

Isn't this the legendary
House of Eminence'?

You got the wrong address.
Sorry.

Nobody here by that name.

Let's go, Duke.

Carter.
Carter, I'm sorry.

You one sorry-assed nigga
is what you is!

Let's go, Duke!

[horn beeping]

I want to make it up to you!
l-low'?

You planning on fucking Princess
in front of me next time'?

If that would turn you on!

Work your magic, baby!

How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry'?

I'm a buy you some
Funyuns and a Fanta

when we get
to this Quick Mart.

How'd you know
where we was going'?

You know you want some
Funyuns and a Fanta!

Funyuns! Funyuns!
Funyuns! Funyuns!

[horns honking]

[loud crash,
glass shattering]

Fuck! Shit!

You all right'?
Eppie all right'?

Eppie, are you OK'?

Eppie! Wake up, Eppie!

Eppie, Wake up!

What do I do, Carter'?

Shut up!
Get her out the car!

Come on.

Get her out the car!

Come on!

Wake up. Wake up!

[all yelling hysterically]

Call an ambulance!

[sirens wail]

I'm just gonna need
to see some identification.

Thank you.
Be right back.

You all OK'?

Do we look like we're OK'?

I know what it's like--

You know what, exactly'?

Everything was just fine
until you showed your ass up!

That's what you know!

Sir?

I need to talk to you
about your vehicle.

What about it, man'?
Nothing happened to my car.

Your car'?

It ain't yours, son.

[siren wails]

Lyle...

You got a visitor.

Hmm...

Beautiful day out there.

Perfect for running around.

I got my nails dinged...

Just like Rihanna.

You know, it's just
one of those days

where you could
just do whatever.

I wouldn't know.

Oh, yeah, that's right.

You come here
to rub this in my face'?

I come here because
that guard over there

has put you in a position
in which I finally get my way.

You are a captive audience -
literally.

So listen up, boy, 'cuz I don't
feel like repeating myself.

I dropped the charges,

but I ain't
rescuing you no further.

I got my car back...

and that's all I need.

And I'm moving in with LeDon,

so there ain't no room for you,

even if I wanted you...

But I don't.

I feel better now.

â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª It's just black love â™ª

â™ª When the Holy Father
from above â™ª

â™ª Cannot save the one
I'm singing off

â™ª And all that is left â™ª

â™ª All that is left â™ª

â™ª All that is <i>left...</i> â™ª

â™ª ls black love â™ª

â™ª

I stand before you...

to celebrate the life
and joy...

of my friend,
Eppie Durall.

She was a pure soul,

filled with a sense
of wonder and discovery.

And I will always...

I will always miss her.

With all due respect,

I won't have any more of this.

His name was Shawn. OK'?

Sir, I didn't mean
any disrespect.

I think otherwise!

His name was Shawn.

You got that'?

Shawn... My boy.

â™ª

â™ª Shawn was born
on the 4th of July â™ª

â™ª Independence Day,
no lie, no lie â™ª

â™ª Twenty-two years later,
who'd think he would die'? â™ª

â™ª Not I, not I, not I â™ª

â™ª One day he said to me â™ª

â™ª "I'm in the wrong skin" â™ª

â™ª I didn't listen to him â™ª

â™ª I'm not proud
of what I did â™ª

â™ª I threw him out â™ª

â™ª I'd take it back if I could â™ª

â™ª But he ran,
he ran, he ran â™ª

â™ª His name is Shawn â™ª

â™ª And now he's gone â™ª

â™ª He's gone,
he's gone, he's gone â™ª

â™ª

<i>â™ª Hey! â™ª</i>

â™ª You gotta get
what you can â™ª

â™ª While the gettin' is good â™ª

â™ª Gettin' is good,
gettin' is good â™ª

â™ª Cuz it's all gone away â™ª

â™ª Like I knew that it would â™ª

â™ª I knew that it would â™ª

â™ª She played her card â™ª

â™ª My heart is scarred â™ª

â™ª She's gone, she's gone away â™ª

â™ª Duane was born my brother â™ª

â™ª The oldest of four â™ª

â™ª When he told me the news
it did more than annoy â™ª

â™ª Couldn't celebrate,
I wanted to destroy â™ª

â™ª That boy, that boy â™ª

â™ª His given name is Duane,
he brought us pain â™ª

Again, and again, and again â™ª

â™ª He said,
A book's more important â™ª

â™ª Than my own flesh and blood â™ª

â™ª Own flesh and blood â™ª

â™ª Flesh and blood â™ª

â™ª I extended a hand â™ª

â™ª He said,
It might cause a flood â™ª

â™ª It might cause a flood â™ª

â™ª He said he'd pray
that my soul would pay â™ª

â™ª Oh, I didn't stay,
I didn't stay, I didn't stay â™ª

â™ª Oh, Jack did the best
that he could â™ª

â™ª He said, I'm misunderstood,
intentions are good â™ª

â™ª Give me a chance, Mama,
to do as I should â™ª

â™ª He begged,
he begged, he begged â™ª

â™ª His name is Jack,
If I could take it back â™ª

â™ª Lord, I would,
I would, I would â™ª

â™ª I tried to be the best man
like you wanted me to â™ª

â™ª You wanted me to,
they wanted me to â™ª

â™ª It wasn't the plan
I could not follow through â™ª

â™ª Could not follow through â™ª

â™ª They tried to sway,
I went astray â™ª

â™ª I've gone, I've gone away â™ª

â™ª Our child brings us shame â™ª

â™ª He's easy to blame,
he's easy to blame â™ª

â™ª He spits in our faith
then he changes his name â™ª

â™ª A shame,
a shame, a shame â™ª

â™ª What he became,
what he became â™ª

â™ª A shame,
a shame, a shame â™ª

â™ª Oh, I was tossed
in a dumpster â™ª

â™ª When I was a child â™ª

â™ª No folks to disappoint,
left to grow wild â™ª

â™ª To keep from going
crazy and acting riled â™ª

â™ª I smiled â™ª

â™ª No one to blame,
didn't change my name â™ª

â™ª They were gone,
they were gone... â™ª

â™ª Gone!
Yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª He ain't coming back â™ª

â™ª No, I don't want him back â™ª

â™ª If I could take him back â™ª

â™ª He best watch his back â™ª

â™ª Ooooh! â™ª

â™ª He's gone! â™ª

You have a lot
of nerve coming here.

You're the reason why
she's in that damn casket.

I just wanna pay my respects.
You wanna be respectful?

The best thing
you can do is leave.

I need to be here.

Oh, I didn't know today
was "What Brad Needs" day.

What are you
gonna do about it'?

Do you really want
to challenge my ability

to go diva
all up on your ass'?

Can I have
your attention, please'?

This is the guy that out
our friend's life short.

Can I see a show of hands
who'd like to see him gone'?

Go on!

Go on!

Queef?

I am done with this!

What are you looking at?

<i>â™ª Hey! â™ª</i>

â™ª You gotta get what you can
while the gettin' is good â™ª

â™ª Gettin' is good,
gettin' is good â™ª

â™ª 'Cuz it's all gone away
like I knew that it would â™ª

â™ª I knew that it would â™ª

â™ª His name is Duane â™ª

â™ª His name is Jack â™ª

â™ª His name is Franklin â™ª

â™ª His name is Shawn â™ª

â™ª His name is Christopher â™ª

â™ª His name is Jermaine â™ª

â™ª Her name is Eppie! â™ª

â™ª - His name is Shawn
Her name is Eppie! â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Or it'll all go away â™ª

â™ª If we don't learn
to get along â™ª

â™ª They're gone â™ª

â™ª They're gone â™ª

â™ª They're gone â™ª

â™ª

â™ª [rhythmic clapping] â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª The walls will
start to crumble â™ª

â™ª The atom splits â™ª

â™ª Nothing stands to reason â™ª

â™ª Nothing fits â™ª

â™ª It's the darkest season â™ª

â™ª It's time for me to quit â™ª

â™ª And I'm the loser â™ª

â™ª It's the end of the line â™ª

â™ª I can no longer persist â™ª

â™ª Can't think of any reason â™ª

â™ª Why I should still exist â™ª

â™ª It's my final chapter â™ª

â™ª Class is dismissed â™ª

â™ª It's the last damn check â™ª

â™ª On my loser's list â™ª

Don't!

I had a feeling
I'd find you here.

Nowhere else to go
but further down.

I'd have to disagree.

I think you've
already hit bottom.

You can only go up.

I'm sorry.

I know.

Come down and let's talk.

Princess and I...

That was just a fling.

She ain't all bad.

She just wants it all now.

You're the more patient kind.

If it's worth waiting for.

What's done...
is done.

We can't go back
and change it now.

But I saw how you
tried to save her.

I saw how much you cared.

I just want what she wanted.

Me too.

â™ª

â™ª I know I did you wrong... â™ª

â™ª Did you wrong... â™ª

â™ª

â™ª I know I'm not perfect â™ª

â™ª And sometimes I wish
life had instructions â™ª

I got nothing to say to him.

Can we talk?

Ain't we talked enough?

Just hear him out.

Fine...

It's your dime.

You're not leaving
because of me, are you'?

Don't flatter yourself.

Sometimes you just have to know
when it's time to let it go.

You know, I figured
something out about Eppie,

and her crazy baby stories.

She just wanted us
to be a family.

You are working
my last gay nerve.

You been hanging around

Tyler Perry sets
too long or what'?

Oh, I'm sorry,
were you saying something'?

I was glistening.

Seriously...

You come into my world,

turn it upside down,

And now you think you can
just come back into my house

and sprinkle some fairy dust

and all of a sudden it's
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY time?

No...

But it's a start.

<i>Wm
