                  I got an idea.

       How about some day
      time skinny dipping?

No way.

              Aww, come on babe.

     I'm gonna swim to that
         buoy and back.

  And I make it, you gotta go

                              â™ª

          [whimpering]

   <i> [beep- Intercom] Actually</i>

                              â™ª

   Hello, you must be our new
            intern.

  Maggie Peterson, I presume?

And you must be
Dr. Nelson.

           Please call me "Ted".

                    Come inside.
        Okay.

                Watch your step.

                              â™ª

   Oh, that's Dr. Leonard. He
 doesn't do well around people.

   Especially if they're new.

  But at any rate, welcome to
          Persephone.

 I'm thrilled to be here. Where
       can I start first?

 Testing Ph levels, or helping
     with today's specimen
          acquisition?

 Raring, to go, huh? I knew we
    hired you for a reason.

 But you've gotta crawl before
 you walk, so, let's start you
       with orientation.

[fake enthusiasm]
Oh. Great.

           It's not like pulling
           teeth, I promise.

So you really signed up to work
in this godforsaken bunker, huh?

  An opportunity to study the
 Great Pacific Garbage patch up
      close and personal?

I'd never pass that up. Besides,
you get to do all the cool stuff
      here at Persephone.

     Deep-sea dives. Animal
   discovery. Save the ocean.

     Well most of the time,
      it's just paperwork.

Maggie: Oh.
Dr. Nelson: But don't worry.
We'll find you something
exciting to do.

 Come on. Let's store your gear
and I'll give you the full tour.

  Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

   Professor Thomas? I've got
 someone here that you may like
            to meet.

Prof. Thomas: Oh! You must be
Maggie.
Maggie: Professor.

It's such an honor to meet you.

   Please. All I do is study
            garbage.
            [laughs]

Oh, we're about to go on the big
tour. Would you like to join us?

       Yeah! I'd love to.

  You know what, we have some
     visitors coming today.

         [Receptionist]
 Calling Dr. Thomas. The Earth
    Pact has just docked...

 Dr. Thomas: Actually, they've
 just arrived. So, why don't we
   all do the tour together.

    You 2 can come with me.

Male: Hey Brad, wait up top with
 the bags while we go down into
         the facility.

                              â™ª

         Earth Pacters!
             Hello!
            Welcome!

We're so glad you could
make it. It's always
nice when we can

work with new,
potential colleagues.

I'm professor Laura Thomas.

And this is Dr. Ted Nelson,

and we have our
newest inter-

                          Greg?!

           [chuckles]
  You've gotta be kidding me?

  Care to introduce us to your
        friend, Maggie?

   Uh... Sure. This is Greg.
         He's a, um...

                   We us to date
                   in college.

                    Before I
                    dropped out,
                    that is.

           Naturally.

  I haven't seen you in what?
            3 years?

   Yeah. Something like that.
           [chuckles]

        You look great.

     Prof. Thomas: Now that
we're all acquainted, why don't
         you follow me.

  <i> Professor Thomas: So guys, </i>
  <i> currently we're half a mile</i>
        <i> under the ocean.</i>

 <i> This underwater station is so</i>
 <i> special to everyone that works</i>
             <i> here.</i>

   <i> With 45 qualified research</i>
 <i> staff. Selected by the worlds</i>
     <i> leading marine biology</i>

<i>university programs and special</i>
        <i> interest groups.</i>

   <i> We have 2 state of the art</i>
    <i> underwater docks, and 3</i>
       <i> submarine vehicles</i>

 <i> capable of collecting samples</i>
     <i> from the ocean floor.</i>

   <i> And Procuring specimens of</i>
     <i> local marine wildlife.</i>

I'd like to formally welcome you
 to the Persephone. It's truly
one of a kind research station.

  We built this station on an
island right next to the Garbage
             patch,

and it features a central crater
   right down into the ocean.

  There are a group of smaller
  islands scattered around the

    facility, used for above
       water operations.

 It's the only research station
 that allows us to fully study
 oceanic, plant and avian life

 that could be impacted by the
  nearby pollution, as well as
             flora.

  We are so pleased that Earth
Pact has agreed to send you all
     out here for the day,

   so you can collect all the
   information that you need.

 Yes. It's something that we've
   been pushing for a while.

  To get activist groups, like
  yourselves, involved and get
   that facts that you need.

Yep! We believe that science and
 activism can go hand in hand,

  and be a powerful force for
            change.

  Well, why don't we get right
  down to the tour, shall we?

Dr. Nelson I'm going to let you
 handle that. I'm gonna head to
       the control room.

           Have fun.

 Okay Maggie, why don't we take
  Greg and your friends and we
    start at the top floor?

    And that why we get your
       tour done as well.

         Sounds great.

    So, uh, we're with you?

        Looks that way.

  Guys, this is my old friend,
            Maggie.

 Maggie, this is Ryan, this is
   Allison, and this is Omar.

   Maggie: Did you gain some
   weight? Or something else.

                              â™ª

  This place must have cost a
            fortune.

Greg: I always expected I would
         see you again.

   Greg: I just didn't think
    it was going to be here.

    Well, surprise, I guess.

 I mean, I always figured you'd
  end up at a place like this,
            though.

              And?

 Yeah. You were always talking
    about being a scientist.

 Trying to invent something to
        save the planet.

       Yeah. And you were
         always saying,

    "the only way to change
     things, was to get out
       there and fight".

      I guess not much has
         changed there.

   Still. We both wanted the
       same thing, right?

     Greg: A better world?

    Sure. Just different...
         methodologies.

      We still ended up in
        the same place.

      Maggie. Greg. Try to
        keep up, please.

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

<i>Dr. Nelson: In here we look very</i>
  <i> closely to how pollution is</i>

     <i> affecting the habitats</i>
 <i> surrounding the Garbage Patch.</i>

   <i> And what this means to the</i>
  <i> animal life native to those</i>
          <i> eco-systems.</i>

  <i> Most organisms we across are</i>
 <i> normal. But we've been seeing</i>

<i>some anomalies appearing in some</i>
       <i> of the creatures.</i>

  <i> Every 4th or 5th specimen we</i>
 <i> pull out from the sea in this</i>
   <i> are manifests a mutation.</i>

<i>We keep them all here to study.</i>

     <i> But enough of that and</i>
 <i> the facility. On to the people</i>
    <i> that make it all happen.</i>

Dr. Nelson: This is the Specimen
room. That's Betts and Sandoval
   over there, hard at work.

 This is where we study animal
 life native to the island and
   the waters both below and

   around the Garbage Patch.

 Check their pollution levels,
    look out for anomalies?

          You got it.

Allison: Whoa, check these
out behind you.
Ryan: Weird.

Omar: That's crazy.

These are amazing.

      Did you guys notice
     anything interesting?

    Yeah, they're mutations.
    Really unique ones, from
      the looks of things.

  Dr. Nelson: That's correct.

 Every fourth or fifth specimen
 we pull from the ocean in this
   area, manifest a mutation.

We keep them all here to study.

Maggie: That's the grim truth of
      what pollution does.

Well, one of the things, anyway.

This is what happens when people
  can just toss their garbage
      wherever they want.

                              â™ª

For instance, take a look at
this turtle specimen.

Exhibits the duel cranium
abnormality.

              Wow.

            Far out.

   Check out this little guy.

             Geez.
            [scoffs]

      Real nice place you
        guys have here.

  Maggie: I don't know what's
 going on or what's happening?

 Dr. Nelson: Something's riling
            them up.

  What could be causing this?

   This sort of behaviors is
   normally triggered by the
 presence of a large predator.

   But this is a bit extreme,
     obviously. Excuse me.

                              â™ª

     That thing is pissed.

                              â™ª

     Dr. Thomas: Hey Steve!

       How's it looking?

  The pollution levels at the
    Patch are looking pretty
        elevated today,

Dr. Thomas: Huh.
Steve: ... other than that,
everything seems fine.

     How are the new kids?

       They're wonderful.

         [phone rings]
  Sorry. I need to take this.
             -Okay.

         [phone ringing]
          Steve here.

 Dr. Nelson: Hey Steve, this is
  Ted. We're down here in the
         specimen room.

    Something's riling these
    creatures pretty badly.

   Can you see if there's any
  seismic activity happening?

  Any sort of weather anomaly?

  Steve: I'll give'er a look.
      Give me two minutes.

         Okay, thanks.

        [hangs up phone]
          -What's up?

  That was the specimen room,
    something's spooking the
           mutations.

   Just checking the tectonic
  plates activity, or maybe...
           [beeping]

         That's weird.

               What do you have?

Something big.
Right off the shoreline.

            [scoffs]
   Could it be a piece of the
 Garbage Patch that broke off?

    Maybe something from the
   current that's coming up?

    Steve: Nothing this big
      would move so fast.

  Steve: I don't know what the
         hell this is.

       It looks like it's
    heading to the surface.

         I'm gonna go topside
         and check it out, okay?

Oh hey, Steve, enable low alert,
just in case.

    Okay.

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

            [laughs]
            No way!

   Is that - is that a whale?

           All right!

                              â™ª

                 [alarm blaring]

           Professor!

         Something up?

    I don't know. Something
   topside. Ted come with me.

      You guys, stay here.

        [alarm blaring]
               â™ª

  I mean, it seems like that's
    where all the action is.

                 That's what I'm
                 talking about.

                       Let's go.

        [alarm blaring]

   [activist group shouting]
           Brad! Hey!

             Brad!
      Get out of the water!

 Male: Brad! Did you ditch us?

   What? No man. I just left
     something on the boat.

    Oh you guys just missed
           it though.

     There was a big whale
     or something out here,
         a minute ago.

        Brad! Get out of
        the water, now!

   Nah, it's fine Professor.
    We've all kicked it with
         whales before.

     Are you serious, Brad?

         Oh, hell yeah!

      Here it comes again.

     You guys gotta see the
      size of this thing.

What was that?

                 I have no idea.

                  Everybody, get
                  back inside.

Brad, stop being an
idiot and get out
of the water.

 I don't think that's a whale.

              Oh!
      [everyone screaming]

          [screaming]
             Brad!

Maggie: Professor.
Dr. Thomas: We need to enable
higher safety protocols, now!

       Maggie: Everybody,

Something's jamming the signal.

   Elevated radiation levels
    from the garbage patch.

 Steve: They play hell with the
radio signal from time to time.

               Not great timing,
               Steve.

    Yeah. Tell me about it.

                              â™ª

   Right. Um... So now what?
      We just wait it out?

 We have ruptures in the hull.

 We're taking on water in some
    places on main level 2.

But it looks like we're working
  on getting those sealed off.

Okay. Stay on high alert. All of
    you. Follow our safety-

        Professor, LOOK!

                              â™ª

It's building speed.

                              â™ª

                      [rumbling]

        This doesn't make sense.

       Sharks are hunters, but
       this level of aggression?

                It's unheard of.

Well, I've never heard
of a giant 3 headed
shark before, either.

But, I guess all
bets are off at
this point.

  We got to seal this section
 off before we take on too much
        water! Come on!

 Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Give me that radio.

                      Holy Hell.

   We need to evacuate, now!

        [alarm blaring]

  Everyone try to remain calm.
           Follow me.

Remain calm?

            Come on!

 Dr. Nelson, get these kids up
     top. Move! Go, go, go!

                              â™ª

      Level 2-B, I got you
        taking on water.

 Steve, A-4 is taking on water.
      Way too much water.

    Brian: We're evacuating
  down here. I'm going to try
        to seal it off.

    You've gotta get out of
     there, Brian. Get out!
      Get out now, Brian!

           [on radio]
 Brian: There's no way out. We-

       [Brian screaming]

Level C? Anyone copy on level C?

       I've got fires all
        over down there.

            Come in.

           [crashing]

              No!
          [expNo!ion]

              Professor, is
              there another way?

 That's the only emergency path
    to the emergency skiffs.

Maggie: There's another option.

      The earth pact boat.

          We can still get there
          from here, right?

                 Back to the
                 main entrance?

Dr. Thomas: If we move fast.
Maggie: Then we'll move fast.

                              â™ª

 Maggie: Where's the Earth Pact
      boat you came in on?

  Professor Thomas: The island
    is flooding. It's got to
        further out now.

                              â™ª

There!

     You're crazy. I'm not
   going out there with that
      thing in the water.

     With the getaway route
    blocked off, this is it.

            Your boat's the only
            chance we have.

                  I'll go first.

Omar: No way, man.
Let me go.

 Greg: No, no, wait. We're not
      fighting about this.

 I'll swim out there, I'll fire
it up, and I'll bring it closer.

Maggie: Greg, I don't think-
Greg: Maggie...

           Trust me.

                              â™ª

       Omar: Greg. Greg!

      [engine sputtering]

                              â™ª

 It's gonna take me a minute to
get this peach of shoot started.

        Just hang tight!

                              â™ª

        Greg: Oh my god!
       Where do I start?

       See, that's what I
       was talking about.

      He doesn't even know
     how to start the boat.

         I should have
        said something.

          I got this.
             -Ryan!
      [everyone shouting]

                              â™ª

                  He'll be fine.

                              â™ª

       Push! Push! Push!
          Get in here!
             -Good.

       [sighs of relief]
           Thank god.

                              â™ª

      Ryan: Get up there!
    Greg: Start the engine!

                              â™ª

                 So, what do you
                 think, Doc?

         You think we got enough
         time to get out there
         and make it or what?

Well, normally we would.
But nothing seems normal
to me about this.


Guys, I can't stay here.
We're gonna die if we
don't leave.

         [all shouting]
         Allison! Wait!

 Greg: Allison! Allison! No no
    no! Stay on the island!

                              â™ª

Omar: You're not going out there
        alone, Allison!

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

         Greg: Allison!

   Come on, come on, Allison!

                              â™ª

   Come on, come on, come on!

     Greg: Omar, it's right
        behind you, bud!

       Greg: Oh, come on!

                     Pick it up!

    Greg: Swim Omar. Faster!

             Omar!

            Nooooo!

             Omar!

Ryan: Oh my god!
Greg: Get this piece of
crap going!

      Greg: Allison, swim!

                              â™ª

           [shouting]
     Greg: Come to me, now!

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

Allison: Throttle, Greg!

       Greg: Go, go, go!

        Allison, go! Go!

    Hey look at me. Look at-

         Guys, go, go!

Greg: Get on the horn. Call the
   Coast Guard, call anyone.

                              â™ª

        Mayday! Mayday!
         Coast Guard?!

            Mayday! Coast Guard,
            are you there?

Dammit!

What do you think?
                     Come on.
                     Come on.

          Can you get
          any closer?

  I don't think I can get this
 thing any closer to the beach
  without running it aground.

       We'd never get this piece
       of started again.

                  There's no
                  straight shot.

 We gotta get out of here before
 that thing attacks the boat.

           The radio's almost
           fixed, I can call for
           help later, okay?

     The<i> thing</i> destroyed the
     whole station. Just imagine
     what it can do to our boat.

We're not leaving them. We're
not leaving anyone else to die.

     All right, there's no
    straight shot. So, just
       hang on a second,

 Let me - let me find a way to
      distract the shark.

     Hey, Allison! Allison!

 Do we have anything on board?
  Anything at all we can use?

Greg, you know we travel light.

  We don't have any - anything
    thing that's gonna reach
           that far.

             Ryan?

                  I got nothing.

   Dr. Thomas: We need to get
    that shark out of there!

        I have an idea.

                   I'm all ears.

   I'm gonna run in. Create a
distraction. Head over that way.

      I'll get just as far
           as I can.

   As soon as It goes for me,
   and I mean, the INSTANT it
         goes for me...

    run and get to the boat,
    and get as far way from
       here as possible.

             Maggie, there's NO
             WAY we're gonna let
             you do that.

It's okay, Dr. Nelson.

This way, I can give you
two at least a chance of
continuing your research.

      Maggie, I can't let
          you do that.

I'm sorry, Professor. You don't
     have a choice in this.

Yes I do. You're not going to be
        the distraction.

       Dr. Thomas: I am!

          [screaming]
              No!

                              â™ª

         What the hell?

                              â™ª

          [whimpering]
           Oh my god!

       Maggie, let's go!
              Now!

                              â™ª

Maggie?
Maggie?

              No!

    Come on! You can do it!

                              â™ª

Ryan & Allison: Swim! Swim!
Greg: Come on, Maggie!

-Yeah! Ryan!
Let's go, Ryan! Let's go!

Greg: Get on the horn.

                              â™ª

              Look how fast that
              damn thing is.

              I don't know if we
              can out run it.

I guess we'll
find out.

            [static]

-I think the radio's working.
Go, go, now!

      Mayday! Coast Guard?
         Anyone there?

   Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
        Is anyone there?

   Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
         Anybody? Help!

   Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
      Coast Guard, please?

       This is Max Burns.

 You're on the wrong frequency.

 Burns: You've reach a fishing
             boat.

Ryan: It doesn't matter. We need
  help from someone. Anybody.

We're coming from the Persephone
   Research Station, near the
         Garbage Patch.

   Ryan: The station's gone.
    A lot of people are dead.
        Can you help us?

 Whoa, whoa, slow down. What do
  you mean, "attacked?" Over.

  My name is Ryan Bennett. I'm
 hailing you from the Transport
        vessel, Ps-001.

            [static]
 Ryan: The station was attacked
         by a giant...

        3 headed shark.

  Ryan: Destroyed the station.
    Killed almost everyone.

            [laughs]
   This better not be a joke.

             Over.

       Ryan: Listen, man,
     I know how it sounds.

But it's a giant 3 headed shark.

[Ryan on radio] It attacked the
   station. It killed almost
           everybody.

                              â™ª

 Burns: A 3 headed shark? What
  have you been smoking, kid?
           [chuckles]

I don't know what you think you
           saw, but-

My friends are dead, man. Dead.

 You got to send someone, now.
 Ships. The Navy. I don't care.

     Get somebody out here.
      'Cause that thing is
      right on top of us!

       Wait, wait, wait!
          Where is it?

                              â™ª

         It broke off.

       Ryan: Over there!

             Oh no.

It's heading right
for that boat.

                              â™ª

                              â™ª

             Crazy.

           [chatter]

              Hey.

        [guests chatter]

     There you go, sailors.

        Thank you, Tori.

           [chuckles]

 Come on, Mrs. Grant. You know
   your money's no good here.

         I told you to
       call me Rosemarie.

"Mrs. Grant" makes me sound like
           my mother.

           [laughing]

    Okay, Rosemarie. Thanks.

                              â™ª

    You gotta listen to us.

        [Ryan on radio]
   That thing is headed for
         another boat.

Some kind of booze cruise. A lot
         of passengers.

 You gotta come now because...

     they're all in danger.

                              â™ª

        [Burns on radio]
 If you're making this up, kid,
         it's your ass.

    Well, we're on our way.

                       Let's go.

               Ship in distress.
               -Let's go.

    [screaming and yelling]

I think I know
what's going on.

                     What is it?

It's being drawn
towards the pollution
of the larger vessel.

            What does that mean?

It's making it insane.

  If it destroyed that island
   and the research station,

    that yacht doesn't stand
       a chance, does it?

I'm afraid not.

                          [sigh]

                              â™ª

         We have to do
      something, you guys.

      We have to stop it.

  Stop it? Stop it with what?

   We don't have anything but
        our wet clothes.

We have to at least try to warn
  that boat, if nothing else.

 We can't let it happen again.

   Not after we just watched
      all our friends die.

       Greg: She's right.

  We have to try to warn them.

  Well, you've lost your mind.

   Greg: No. They're the ones
   thinking with clear heads.

    We just watched all our
   friends get eaten by that
      monster. All of them.

 You guys want to save our own
  asses, while we let innocent
          people die?

   What if we can save them?

           All right.

                              â™ª

                      All right.

       Greg: Here we go.

                              â™ª

That's odd.

                   Whale, maybe?

         The tour company didn't
         say anything about
         whale season.

                              â™ª

        Ryan: Hey Burns.

    Burns? It's Ryan again.

We're headed right for the boat.

                              â™ª

We're going to try to warn them
  but, we can use your help as
soon as you can get here. Over.

    Earth Pact. On our way.
          Hang tough.

   That is really good news.

       Just come as fast
       as you can, okay?

  Snorkeler: A big shadow moved
    past me under the water.

   Did you guys see anything
         from up there?

     Female: What was that?

  Co-captain: It hit us pretty
  hard. We're taking on water.

Captain: Yeah, we've lost power
    on the port side engine.

  You round out and check the
engine room, alert the crew, I'm
      gonna call this in.

           Yes, sir.

    Mayday, mayday, mayday.

       Hey, if I can have
     everyone's attention,
            please.

We're going to pull anchor here
 in just a couple minutes. The
  Coast Guard is on their way.

Captain, help us! Where are the
          life rafts?!

Captain: I'm sorry.
Male: We need to get
off this boat!

 Just tell us where they are?!

Captain: I'm sorry, we don't
have anything.
Female: What?

        No life rafts?!
      Are you kidding me?!

         It's all good.
       Don't mention it.

-Oh.
-Oh shoot.

   [screaming at a distance]

Now what?

We're a sitting duck down here.

 This heap's on its last legs.

     From the looks of this
     thing, isn't doing any
      better than we are.

     We're gonna do what we
        came here to do.

          Try to help.

     Let's take that ladder
        all the way up.

       Come on you guys.
           Let's go.

       [Howard screaming]

                              â™ª

 Where did you guys come from?

    We- we were at a nearby
       research station.

    That shark attacked us,
    wrecked the whole place.

 We saw it coming this way and
 tried to warn you guys, but...

       You were too late.

Rosemarie: My fiancÃ©, Howard.
-Relax. We have to rescue
Howard.

                Where is Howard?

On the other side of this door.
          It's locked.

     We don't have a lot of
        time, you guys.

     What about life boats?

      There no life boats.

Ryan: Your kidding me.
Maggie: Oh my god.

Greg, how many people can fit on
      the Earth Pact boat?

  Maybe 12. I don't know, the
engine's on it's last legs. You
     know, any extra weigh-

     [Rosemarie screaming]
            Howard!

     Fine, I'll go get him.
      -I'm going with you.

Fine, let's just be quick about
 it. Greg, you stay here. Make
   sure everyone stays safe.

          Be careful.

   Hey man, let me see that.

        I'm coming too.

          Step aside.

    Howard, can you hear us?

            Hey bud?

Dr. Nelson: Howard?

            Howard?

  Dr. Nelson: Howard, can you
            hear us?

  Dr. Nelson: Howard, can you

          Hey, Howard?

            Howard?

      Dr. Nelson: Howard?

        Maggie: Howard?

    Stanley: Say something.

    Dr. Nelson: I see legs!

             There!

        He's over there.

            Howard!

            [grunt]

            [grunts]

        You'll be okay.
        You'll be okay.

      We're gonna get you
       out of here, okay?

          Okay, ready?
           1...2...3.

            [grunts]

        Up, up, up, up.

There we go.
There we go.

Slowly.
Slowly.

Come on.
You go first. You go first.
                        Easy.

    Dr. Nelson: Yep, got it.
    Slowly, slowly, slowly.

            [coughs]
       [moans and groans]

  Female: It's gonna be okay.

Greg: Hey, hey. Look at me. Look

        here, All right?

       [panicked chatter]
            [chaos]

  Allison, put pressure on the
    wound. Keep that tight.

            [crying]
           You okay?

    It can only stay out of
       water for so long.

  We have to get to the Earth
           Pact, now.

             You want me to get
             back in that water?

Hey, wait a minute. What
about all these people?

We can't save all these people!

    In about 2 minutes we're
   gonna be in the water, no
       matter what we do.

Might as well get into the only
    boat we know that works.

  She's right. We got go, now!

       Come on. We got to
        get down there.

            [growl]

Stanley: Got here?
Greg: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

            [growl]

   It's just a little wobbly.

     Rosemarie: I'm scared.

      Stanley: Easy. Easy.

        Greg: Foot here.

Rosemarie: What if I go
backwards?
Ryan: Be careful. Be careful.

     Ryan: Just hold tight.

            [growl]

        Step over here?

   Greg: One more. One more.
     Come down all the way.

Rosemarie: Here?
Greg: You're good. You're good.
Right here. Here you go.

                 Come over here.

  Greg: I got you right here.

     Hey, give me the axe.

Ryan: Give me.
Stanley: What are you doing?

You take care of
them all, okay?

           Good luck.

        [Greg shouting]
      Guys, we got to go!
            Come on!

Greg: What is
going on?

             Greg: Where's Ryan?

What is he doing?

      Stanley?
                     Yeah?

Go start the engine!
                     All right.

       [starting engine]

Its okay.


                      I'm sorry.

       How's it looking?

           Not great.

  It's got maybe 20 miles, if
          we're lucky.

     You're heading north?

Yeah.

                  And we're east
                  of Persephone?

Yeah. I see it on
the left, why?

                     Head north.

                North-west, now!

            And keep it floored.

Are you sure?

            On the way to the
            Persephone, I passed
            a small atoll.

             Looked like a party
             pier type of place.

     Should be 10, 15 miles out.

Do you think we'll
be safe there?

               I think it's the
               only land that we
               can reach.

             Right now, it's the
             only thing we have.

                        Hold on.

                Engine's looking
                rough, man.

      Yeah, yeah. I know.
     Just got keep driving
       till it gives out.

      Yeah, that's usually
          my strategy.

              Hey!

     Heads up! That thing's
       coming back guys.

Doesn't that thing ever give up?

         Why should it?

         It's winning.

           [growling]

             There.
          There it is!

      Think we'll make it?

    I'm gonna do everything
        I possibly can.

Hey, I think that's Burn's boat.

            Finally!

    We're almost there guys.
           Get ready.

                 Keep it steady.

You got it.

      Send that thing back
      to Hell, would you?

           [growling]

        This is our only
       chance, you guys.

    We have to swim for it.

              Hey!

              Hey!

   Male: [crying] Is he gone?
         -Who are you?

         [male crying]
          Is he gone?

                            Hey!

      How are you feeling?

     I feel like I just got
       chased by a shark.

           [laughing]

[male crying]
-is he gone?
Stanley: Who are you?

[male crying]
-is he gone? Is he gone?
Stanley: Who are you?

             Hey! Hey!
             What happened here?

        Stanley: Jesus.

You mean they can come this far
up the shore and do this kind of
            damage?

You've seen exactly
what It can do.

That<i> thing</i> can get to us
no matter where we are.

               They how the hell
               do we stop it?

The only things we got going for
 us right now are that, it can
stay out of water for too long.

   And as Dr. Nelson tried to
 explain, it may need polluted
       water to survive.

          And it maybe attracted
          to to higher levels of
          pollution.

             Right.

Stanley: There's one more thing
         you know know.

 It grows more heads every time
        you cut one off.

     Like some damn hydra.

     That actually might be
      something we can us.

                            How?

It's getting angrier.
More violent.

You saw how each head was
fighting the other, back there.

    Stanley: Can we use that
          against it?

       How long have you
           been here?

    So it's not gone, is it?

   The- the thing that killed
    everyone. The shark with
         all the heads.

            [crying]
         It's not gone.

            [crying]
        Did you kill it?

              It-

         It's not good.

            [crying]
      We're all gonna die.

How- how did you guys get here?

   Did you guys take a boat?
 Did you guys get dropped off?

            [crying]
       We came in boats.

Flat boats.

                  Like Pontoons?

Yeah. Pontoons.

   Whe - where the Pontoons?

    They docked them on the
   other side of the island.

Do you think they're still here?

Are you kidding me?!

I wasn't going outside
the cabana with that
thing still in the water.

I just hide.

Stayed as quiet
as I could.

Till I heard voices.

         Where are the Pontoons?
         Point them out.

            We can go, together.


They're on the other
side of the island.

              Stanley: Where at?

Over there.

                   Are you sure?

Pretty sure.

   All right guys, let's go.

           [growling]

     All right you guys. We
    need to head out of here
       as fast as we can.

   You four, take that boat.
 Greg, Stanley, and I will take
      the boat back here.

   Allison, check the engine.
     -Got it. Guys get in.

    All right guys. If we're
    gonna go, we better go.

                     Let's go.
       Allison!

It's working!

       Do you hear that?
           [chuckles]

           Haul ass!

Don't worry,
you're safe now.

We'll be back
home in no time.

Okay?

            We're gonna be okay.

   Rosemarie: No more sharks.

                        Finally.

                          [sigh]

           [growling]

              Hey!

  What are they trying to say?

             Shark!

             Look!

What's wrong?

        Maggie: Allison!

             Shark!

           [growling]

            Allison!

             Guys!

    We have to do something!

          Turn around!

      Stanley: Behind you!

       Right behind you!

          It's coming!

    Maggie: Look behind you!

             Shark!

           [growling]

            Allison!

      Maggie: Look behind!

           [growling]

          [explosion]

             Shoot.

   Greg, what are you doing?

Greg, what are you doing?! We
have to go save them!
They are gone!

Maggie, we have to save
ourselves!
No! We have to help them!

  There's something we can do!
            Please!

     We have to help them!
   Those are our friends. We
     have to go save them!

             Greg!

             Fine.

      What are you doing?

  We might be able to save our
 friends, but we're gonna kill
          that shark.

       Yeah, she's right.

        Greg: All right.

             Well?

       How exactly do you
      plan on doing that?

          The garbage.

  It's been the pollution this
          whole time.

  It's attracted to pollution.

 If we can somehow lead it back
 to the Garbage Patch, maybe we
          can kill it.

    Maggie: There will be so
  much to eat, it will go into
       a feeding frenzy.

      We'll get it to eat
         itself alive.

How fast can you get back there?

           [chuckles]
     Hopefully fast enough.

   That party is what, 10, 15
     miles from the patch?
             -Yeah.

  We're already halfway there.

           Hey guys?

    Look at all this garbage.

  Should be able to eat it the
        whole way back.

That's perfect. Come on, Greg.
Let's drive. Go!
-Yeah.

        [starts engine]

            [splash]

            [splash]

       Hey! It's working!

You got it! Keep going.
-Go, go, go.

      Hurry, hurry, hurry!
      We're almost there!

          [screaming]

           It got 'em!
            Maggie!

          Go, go, go!

        Maggie: Stanley!

            Stanley!

          [screaming]

             Relax.
             Relax.

Sorry. It ate the last bag.
-It's okay.

          We ran out of garbage.

It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

            He ate the last one.
            I think we lost him.

Don't worry,
We'll get him!

           [growling]

Hold it tight, keep
the pressure on.

             [breathing heavily]

                 Hey, he's still
                 a shark, right?

Yeah. Sit.
Stanley, relax!

Fueled by garbage and pollution,
right?
-Yes. Stanley, what are you
doing?

             [breathing heavily]

                  I'm not gonna
                 make it anyway.
   What?

          Stanley! No!

        No, no, no, no!
          Stanley! No!

           [growling]

             Wait, wait, wait!
             What are you doing?

     I'm gonna go save him!
      -Maggie, No! Listen!

   Remember you told me that
    I was always a fighter?

   You've done enough today.

         It's my turn.

    Greg: I'll get him back!

 Stanley: Get back in the boat!
          I got this!

 Greg: Stanley! get back here!

  Maggie: Stanley! Come back!

Greg: It's too dangerous!
Stanley: I think it's working.
Maggie: Turn back now!

 Stanley: The shark is starting
           to follow.

      Greg: Don't do this!
 Stanley: Take care of Maggie.

             [thud]

             Greg!

         Greg: Stanley!

      [breathing heavily]
           [whispers]
            Stanley.

             [gasp]
           Oh my god.

        Greg: The shark!

           Oh, damn!

    Greg! Hurry! Come back!
             Hurry!

          Hurry! Swim!
          Swim! Swim!

   Maggie: Greg! Swim! Hurry!
        Hurry up! Swim!

       [indistinct audio]

        [growl/chomping]

        [growl/chomping]

Maggie: Greg! Now's your chance.
    Get back onto the boat!

        [growl/chomping]

        [growl/chomping]

        [growl/chomping]

        [growl/chomping]

         It's working!
         It's working!

        [growl/chomping]

              Oh!
          -You did it!
        [greg laughing]

           [laughing]

      Maggie: You did it.

           Sit down.

    [helicopter approaching]

           We did it.

    [helicopter approaching]

  Get your feet out the water.

              [laughs]
                  Out the water.
