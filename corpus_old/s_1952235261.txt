<i>I came to America in 1914,
by way of Philadelphia.</i>

<i>That's where I got off the boat.</i>

<i>And then I came to Baltimore.</i>

<i>It was the most beautiful place
you've ever seen in your life.</i>

<i>There were lights everywhere.
What lights they had!</i>

<i>It was a celebration of lights.</i>

<i>I thought they were for me:
"Sam was in America."</i>

<i>Sam was in America.</i>

<i>I didn't know what holiday it was,
but there were lights.</i>

<i>And I walked under them.</i>

<i>The sky exploded! People cheered!</i>

<i>There were fireworks.
What a welcome it was!</i>

<i>What a welcome!</i>

<i>I didn't know where my brothers were.</i>

<i>I had an address on a letter,
but when I went there, they'd moved.</i>

<i>I found the man
who knew the name Krichinsky.</i>

<i>He was a little man with big shoes.
I'll never forget him.</i>

<i>He had such big shoes!
They were brand-new, beautiful shoes.</i>

<i>He told me this was
how he made his living.</i>

<i>He would break in shoes
for the wealthy.</i>

<i>Stuff them with newspaper
and walk in them.</i>

<i>I said, "What a country is this.
What a country."</i>

<i>The wealthy didn't even have
to break in their own shoes.</i>

<i>So this man with the shoes took me
down one street after another.</i>

<i>We walked and walked...</i>

<i>...and the skies would light up
and explode in a celebration.</i>

<i>And then we came to Avalon.</i>

<i>And the man with the shoes yelled,
"Krichinsky! Krichinsky!"</i>

<i>And my four brothers looked down
and saw me.</i>

<i>"Sam!"</i>

<i>Sam.</i>

<i>Sam.</i>

And that's when I came to America.
It was the Fourth of July.

Boy, did they used to celebrate.
Big celebrations.

They closed the streets
and would celebrate through the night.

What happened to the guy
who wore the big shoes?

The funny thing is, he did it
for another two years.

He brought his brother
into the business.

They would walk the streets, breaking
in shoes. Then he got an idea!

Why not make shoes that fit right?

They became custom shoemakers:
The Solomon Brothers.

They made shoes, pants.
And then they were a department store.

But the Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

The five Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

<i>And we worked and worked
and worked.</i>

<i>Except Gabriel didn't work.</i>

<i>Gabriel used to point a lot.
"There's a crease, it's not straight."</i>

He was the inspector.
He was the inspector.

How did you all get
to be wallpaper hangers?

It was your grandfather William.

He came to America first
and worked in the department store...

...where they sold wallpaper
and do wallpaper hanging for people.

So he became a wallpaper hanger.

And as each brother came over,
we all became wallpaper hangers.

But on the weekend, we made music.

What music it was!

<i>We liked American music.
We were very popular ourselves.</i>

<i>One night...</i>

<i>...I looked across the floor
and I saw...</i>

<i>...this young, lovely girl.</i>

<i>I wasn't handsome,
and I didn't have a beautiful body.</i>

<i>But when I touched a woman...</i>

<i>...they fell in love with me.</i>

<i>Oh, the family! How it grew.
The wives, the kids.</i>

<i>Krichinskys everywhere, everywhere.</i>

<i>So we had the family-circle meetings.</i>

<i>We put money in the hat to bring over
the cousins, the aunts, the uncles.</i>

<i>And then, out of the blue,
William gets the flu.</i>

<i>It was a terrible epidemic,
the flu of 1919.</i>

<i>Thousands died.</i>

<i>William died.</i>

<i>He was a young man.
He left three kids.</i>

Sam, how many times do we
have to hear this story?

We know this story.
We heard it before.

If we don't tell them, they don't know.
Last year, Bill died.

Was very warm last year
when Bill died.

How many times
do we have to hear this?

The children know this story.

I'm telling them about
when I came here.

Yeah, we know about it.
We all heard it before.

Dad, you want to cut the turkey,
or do you want me to?

I wanted to tell them about
when my father came here.

You have plenty of time
to talk about your father.

Sorry we're late.

Another minute, we would've cut the
turkey without you and started to eat.

To cut the turkey without me present?

We leave the house!

We didn't cut the turkey.
I heard the turkey was cut.

I was just talking
about when Bill died.

Thank God we are late.

I don't understand this holiday.
I'll never understand it.

What's not to understand?
Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving.

We're giving thanks to who?

You're giving thanks
for what you have.

How many times do we have
to go through this?

All I'm saying is, we had to get
the turkey and kill it to give thanks.

If it wasn't this holiday,
we wouldn't have turkey.

I don't eat turkey the rest
of the year. Why do I have to now?

Mom, don't give thanks, okay?

Time to tell the kids
when my father came to America.

Can't it wait till later?

They should hear this story.

Eva, this is very tender.

Of course it is.
It's a beautiful bird.

The turkey was in the basement alive.
She killed it.

We brought my father over in '25.

'25?
William died in 1919. '25.

'25? It was later than '25!

He came the same year
we brought Bill and Edith.

Bill and Edith came after!

After?
Yeah, after.

It was '26.

What's the difference?
He came to America, right?

It's a big difference
between '25 and '26.

One is '25 and the other is '26.

All's I'm saying is,
who cares if it was '25 or '26?

Jules, Jules, if you stop remembering,
you forget.

It was '26.

I remember the excitement
when you went to meet him.

<i>Finally, the father was coming.
We saved the money and sent it to him.</i>

<i>The whole family went to the border--</i>

<i>Jules, you were just a little kid.</i>

<i>It was cold!</i>

<i>We went to the marketplace.
It was cold. It was cold.</i>

What are you talking about,
it was cold? It was late May.

May? I remember cold.

No, you're thinking of when
Irene was getting married.

It was bitter cold then. No,
it was May 17 when your father came.

Anyway, we went, the whole family.

<i>The brothers, the wives, the kids.</i>

<i>I didn't go,
and all the kids didn't go.</i>

We waited in the house.

There was such excitement.
The father, the father was coming.

All I ever heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."

The head of the family.
I pictured this big, powerful man.

<i>All I'd heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."</i>

<i>The father's word when he speaks...</i>

<i>So I'm there. I see him.</i>

<i>He's shorter than me, and I'm only 6.</i>

<i>He was this little...</i>

He was a little, little man.

I never said he was big.

But I said he was the father.

From the day...

<i>From the day he came to America,
he never had to work.</i>

<i>Not a day in his life.
Each of us would give him 10 percent.</i>

<i>Ten percent?</i>

<i>Right? Right? Yeah.</i>

<i>Ten percent. He was the father.</i>

<i>He never drank water.</i>

The entire time he was in America,
from the day he came...

...he drank whiskey or seltzer water.

He never drank water.

And oh, boy, could he drink!

What was that stuff called
he always used to drink?

Slivovitz. Slivovitz.

He used to call it "Block and Fall."

You have one drink of that,
you walk one block and you fall!

If you have one drink...

It's such a strong drink,
it burned the gums out.

He was funny. He was funny.
Very, very, very funny.

How often did he drink water?

Never, ever touched it.
How many times--?

I'm sitting across from you,
you can't hear it?

He never drank water!

That means he doesn't drink.
I got it.

You asked me, I told you.
Now I'm telling you some more.

Occasionally, maybe,
he had some water.

He never drank water.

So he didn't like it.

He didn't like water.
How many times...?

Hymie, Gabriel, Jules.

Are aunts kids
before they become aunts?

Everybody's a kid
before they become an aunt.

They are?
I thought they just popped out.

I've been thinking about it.

It's a good time
we open our own business.

Open our own business?
What, are you kidding?

Think of the risk involved.

We got good routes.
Why should we gamble?

It's perfect.
We got built-in customers.

We open our own place. We keep
the routes, but switch people to us.

We sell the same goods,
except the money goes in our pockets.

You don't think
Simmons will sit still?

We open our own place,
he'll put someone on our routes.

We'll hold on to the customers.
They like us, trust us.

We won't hold on to everybody.
We'll lose customers.

This is less dollars,
and we got to find new customers.

The war is over, right?

There's lots of people with lots
of money. It's a good time to gamble.

Dessert!

I hear dessert?

I hear dessert.

Dessert.

Bring me dessert.

The kids aren't having dessert?

My grandmother is grandmother to me,
but she's not grandmother to Teddy.

Yes, right.
Then what is she?

She's Teddy's great-aunt.

There are aunts and great-aunts?

What's the difference between
a regular aunt and a great-aunt?

They're older. That's the difference.

It's not because they're older.

Because then someday,
all aunts would be great-aunts.

But why are great-aunts
just called great-aunts?

Why not "good aunts" or
"fantastic aunts" or "terrible aunts"?

No. It doesn't have anything to do
with what kind of person they are.

It's got to do with great.
You know, they're great, older.

What about those red ants that
crawl around and bite you?

No, no, no. That's A-N-T.

Ant.

What's a first cousin, twice removed?

I have absolutely no idea.

I'm going selling with my dad today.

You're not going to school?

Christmas holidays. No school.

Christmas holiday.

Keep your nose clean.
Yeah.

How come you didn't become
a wallpaper hanger like Sam?

Well, Sam always had this idea...

...that doing manual labor
had no dignity, but selling...

"Selling was security," he said.

No matter where you are
or what you're selling...

...you can always make a living.

Can you sell anything?
Anything. I can sell anything.

See, it's all a question of
being able to talk to people.

The product?
It doesn't make any difference.

You're selling yourself.

Can you sell model trains?

As many as they can make.
Can you sell toothbrushes?

To as many people as have teeth.

Quick! See that car?
What car is that?

Chrysler!

The one over there on the right?

Nash!
Pretty good.

Give me your money.

What's that?
Give me your money.

Are you kidding me?

No, I'm not kidding you.
Give me your money.

What, are you robbing me?
With all these houses around?

Yeah, I'm robbing you.

Get help.

I can't play.

I can't play.

<i>I never learned to play the piano.</i>

<i>I never learned.</i>

I said, I never learned.

Jules!

I can't. I can't play the piano.

I can't play.

No, I can't.
I can't play the piano.

See!

He can't play, but he can learn!

<i>I can't play.</i>

<i>That's the problem with collecting.</i>

<i>I know that's got to be
a problem with collecting.</i>

<i>It's unheard of.</i>

<i>When you have lots of money...</i>

It's unheard of to stab somebody
and take the money.

I never heard of it.

I don't want to know about it.
Not like in the old days.

When they know you got lots of money,
somebody wants the money.

We know that.

We know that. But who wants it?

It's not like it used to be!
A man can't walk in the street?

Never, never, never.
It's the money that's the problem.

You're right.
Somebody tries to kill--

Somebody tries to kill my boy
just for money.

That's not good. That's not good!
It's the money.

It's not good.
No good.

Money, money, money, that's it.

That's the whole problem. Money.
Money.

When I was a little younger
than you...

...I used to think
the world was made up...

...of big people and little people.

And that's the way
it would always stay.

And then I always wondered
why sinks were too high.

You had to climb up to wash your face.
Cupboards, too high.

The hole in the toilet was too big.

Nothing was made for us.

It's just a world of big people
and little people.

You never got any older...

...and nobody ever died.

<i>Michael!</i>

Michael.

I talked to the doctor.
Your father's gonna be all right.

There, you got it?
Yeah, yeah. Hold it.

What is it? What is it?

What could it be? It's so big.

It's a holiday gift.
What is it?

What is it? What is it?

It's a surprise. Wait and see.

The family circle voted and decided
to get you a holiday get-well gift.

For me?

Oh, you didn't! You didn't!

So, what is this?

A television.

That's television.
You can only watch for so long.

To me, it doesn't have
what a radio has.

Yes, it does.

Anybody want coffee?

Yes.

Nice picture, huh?

Beautiful picture.

Never happened.

In the old country, never heard of
stabbing someone to take their money.

Never happened.

You're right.
But the government would kill you.

Would take your money,
your property, whatever you had.

You know what you have to do?
Be like in Westerns.

Have a stagecoach
and the shotgun when you collect.

That's what they had in the Wild West,
because of outlaws.

Yeah, that's what you need.
There's always robbers.

What was the movie we saw with
the stagecoach? A very good movie.

<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
The movie had a stagecoach.

<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
Very active movie.

John Wayne, he was an outlaw
but was not an outlaw.

What was the movie called
with the stagecoach?

<i>Stagecoach.</i>

That's what I'm saying,
with the stagecoach.

<i>- Stagecoach.
Stagecoach</i>?

I saw a nice little shop
off Helen's Market...

...on the southeast corner.

Supposing we do do this, what are
we selling? Same things we sell now?

Yeah, only for less
than running the routes.

Pots and pans?

Pots, pans,
vacuum cleaners, everything.

The time is right
we get out on our own.

We don't have enough money.
Now is not right.

Ann, please.
All right.

The problem is, Jules,
we never have privacy.

Everybody's on top of everybody.
We need our own place.

And we'll get it.
But Izzy's right.

This is the time for us to use
our savings for our own business.

We can get off the street
and try to make a go of it.

Well, I know that's the best thing.

I just can't promise
I'm gonna remain sane.

You put on a little sweater.

Yeah, be sure to take small steps.
There's a little wind.

Michael! Forgot your lunch money.

Toss it.

Ann! Do we leave at 10:30?

Yeah, that'll be fine!
I have to be back at 1:00.

I have to go to the doctor's
with Jules.

You're not driving, are you?

No, I'm still taking the lessons.
Oh, thank God.

"Can" is whether you're capable
of doing something.

"May" is asking for permission.

Yes, Michael?
Can I go to the bathroom?

Michael, do you want
to repeat that question?

Oh, no, I'm going
to be made an example of.

Michael.

I said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

You can, but you may not.

Well, can I or can't I?

I don't think you've been paying
attention, have you, Michael Kaye?

Yes, I have.

So how would you
rephrase the question?

Can I please go to the bathroom?

Children.

Michael Kaye, why don't you just
spend some time in the hallway...

...until you've learned the difference
between "can" and "may."

When you've learned the difference,
then you may come back in.

I have to go to the bathroom,
but I'm afraid to ask.

Now, does anyone know the difference
between "can" and "may"?

Young man, have you learned the
difference between "may" and "can"?

Not yet.

You stay out there
until you've learned the difference.

Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

Well? Are you ready
to rejoin the class, Michael?

Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

And what's the difference
between "may" and "can"?

Give me a little more time.

Young man, what are you doing
in the hallway?

Learning the difference
between "may" and "can."

How long do you think it would take?

Hello?

Is this Mr. Kaye?

His father, Mr. Krichinsky.

No, he's at the doctor's,
but he's fine. Who is this?

This is Mr. Dunn,
the principal of Michael's school.

We seem to have a problem.

Is he sick?

We seem to have a problem
between "may" and "can."

What's the problem?

That's the lesson they were learning.

Michael asked
if he could go to the bathroom.

He said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

What's the problem?
He asked to go to the bathroom.

He asked, but he asked incorrectly.

Did he raise his hand?
Yes, he did.

But the point is, it was
a lesson about "may" and "can."

Okay, it's fine with me.
So, what's the problem?

He asked, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

That's confusing to the kid,
because you're saying, "You can"...

...and then you say,
"You can, but you can't."

You don't understand the subtleties...

...of the English language,
Mr. Krichinsky.

This English, it's very difficult.

I never realized
how difficult English is.

"May" or "can."
You can, but you may not.

We've come a long way.

In the old days, if you had to pee,
you peed on a tree.

There's no "may" or "can."
That's progress for you.

Oh, my God.

Hon?

I got it.

The store...

...televisions.

Wall-to-wall televisions.

We'll sell more of them.
How will we sell more of them?

We'll sell them cheaper.

Televisions, televisions,
from one end of the shop to the other.

Nothing but televisions.

I think something's about to happen.

Seems like the humming's getting less.

That's when something's
about to happen.

Seems like it's humming
the same hum to me.

You better hope they start getting
some more interesting programs.

See, I told you something
was going to happen.

It's <i>Howdy Doody.</i>

We're getting ahead of ourselves
with this television.

Why don't we add some linoleums,
toasters, pots and pans, brooms.

Get a little foot traffic
in here, you know?

Maybe that'll help.

Why are they not coming in here?

<i>Electronic equipment!</i>

<i>Here's adventure!</i>

<i>And now let's return
to</i> Westinghouse Studio One.

<i>And</i> Letter from Cairo.

<i>--fighting for law
and order, captain...</i>

<i>Here's adventure.</i>

<i>Here's romance.</i>

<i>Mr. I-magination</i>

<i>The Cisco Kid.</i>

<i>- Henry Aldrich!
Coming, Mother.</i>

<i>The Colgate Comedy Hour.</i>

<i>Say the secret word for $100.</i>

<i>It's a common word for something
you find around the house.</i>

<i>Well, well, well.
Good evening.</i>

<i>It is Wednesday night again,
and I'm back on television.</i>

<i>--Your Hit Parade.</i>

<i>Time now to enjoy</i> What's My Line?

The George Burns
and Gracie Allen Show.

Well, what does it mean?
What?

What does it mean, the suburbs?
It's just a nicer place to live.

That's what it means? A nicer place?

Yes, it's nicer.
It's got lawns and big trees.

Uncle Izzy and Teddy and everyone,
they'll be there too?

In one house in the suburbs?

God, please be careful!
It's a very old piece.

Yes, ma'am. We've got it.
Huh? In one house?

No, Michael, it's gonna be the same.

Your grandparents will live
in our house.

We'll all live near each other.
Please don't distract me.

It's gonna rain, I got furniture
in the street, I'm gonna panic.

Aunt Dottie, Aunt Dottie!
Is this a good thing that's happening?

What?

Is this a good thing,
going to the suburbs?

Am I gonna like it there?
You kids are gonna love it.

We've been here forever.

We're even gonna have
to go to a new school.

You ever been in the suburbs?

I never even heard of the suburbs
until this thing happened.

Wait a minute.
Where you running with that?

Wait a minute.
Ma, they'll wrap it.

No, no. We take this in the car.
It'll be wrapped.

No, no. We take it in the car.

The truck hits a bump,
anything could happen.

Okay, we're all set.

I remember Michael learned
how to walk right here.

Held on to the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

He went right to your room.

Yeah, I remember.
What was he? A year old?

No, no, not a year.

Nine months.

Held the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

Nine months.

What's wrong, Pop?

I don't know, I don't know.

I get nervous about making a change.

What are you talking about?
You came to America.

We're just going to the suburbs.

I came to America in 1914...

...but I was a young man.

Oh, come on, Dad.

What about the house?
You saw the house.

Forest Park area. It's beautiful.

We're gonna have more room
for the whole family.

We're getting farther
and farther away from Avalon.

I think I'm getting
too old for change.

<i>- Bill, are you hurt?
Not a bit. Cut me loose.</i>

No, Sam, don't feed the dog
from the table.

He likes meat.

Don't give him big pieces.
He has a small throat.

What's wrong with the green beans?
I don't like green beans.

Since when you don't like green beans?

Never. I never eat green beans.

I cannot believe we argue over the dog
and the green beans every meal.

Green beans and the dog.
Like it's the first time.

Constantly you argue
about the same thing.

It's not an argument,
it's dinner talk.

Dad, this goes on all the time.

Whether it's green beans
or feeding Nimo...

...constantly you two
have a problem at dinner.

Constantly?
Yeah. How about drinks?

Mom says you can't mix drinks.

The mixes he makes
is not a good drink.

Let's not get into
the drinks thing now.

What are you talking about?
I take the juice from the pears...

...mix it with Coca-Cola.
It's a good drink.

Oh, please. You're going to
make me sick with this.

Sam, I said don't feed the dog
from the table.

Oh, my God.

We're thinking of keeping the store
open a couple nights until 9.

Do you have to?

If we want to stay competitive.
The other shops stay open later.

He's gonna choke to death.

One night we look under the table,
the dog will be dead.

I spoke to Izzy about the family
meeting that's supposed to be here.

Some of the brothers feel
it's too far to go.

Too far?

How far can it be? They get on
Rogers over the Liberty Heights.

We know how to go.

Why Rogers? You take Greenspring.
There's no light.

It's a bottleneck.

It's not.
It is.

It's not!

It's a bottleneck.
I say you take Rogers.

To go to Rogers, he's got to go up
Park Circle. Why Rogers?

The question is not which way they'll
come. They think it is too far.

What do you want? You want me to
tell them to move out?

I don't want you to tell them
to move out.

I just was expressing a feeling
that maybe, you know...

...you can get them their own place
and chip in with the rent.

Their own place? Where would
the money come from?

I don't have the money yet.
They don't either.

I know, I just feel...

...there's always
somebody watching over me.

Every time I do something,
I feel like somebody's...

...thinking that they
could do it better.

What? I don't know.

I put something down, I like how
it looks on the coffee table...

...I come back and it's moved.

You want me to talk to her?

I'd like to put something down,
and have it there when I return.

Do you want me to talk to her?
I will.

I'll talk to her again and again,
but it doesn't do any good.

You know her. She's like an enigma.

I feel like I'm still with
my mom and dad.

I'd like to feel like this is my home.
Feel like the mom in my own house.

I understand. I understand that.

I go out and buy what I consider to be
an attractive outfit.

I come home, "No, it's too tight here.
The material's not becoming to you.

It looks too heavy for summer."
Or whatever it is.

She speaks her mind.
She's got opinions.

I'd like to feel good about what I buy
for my house or myself.

Don't let her make you feel bad.

How can I help it?

Put her in her place.
Right.

You gotta do that sometimes.

I don't know.
You gotta put her in her place.

I just would like to feel like
I live in my house.

You do. You live here.

What do you want from me?
I don't know what to do.

I know. I'm just...

...talking.

I got it!

Hi, Eva.

Hi, Nimo.
Where's your mother?

She's in the dining room.

Come on, let's play a game.
Got it.

You're not going to believe this.

I got a call.

American Red Cross.
My brother's alive in Europe.

What?

I can't believe it.
I have to sit down.

I need something to drink.
I ran to get here.

I'll get you some lemonade.

Oh, it's too sweet. Not too sweet.

My heart. My heart is running.

So, Ma, what happened?

Well, I don't know exactly.

He was in a concentration camp.

He lived through
the concentration camp.

They found him, but I don't know.

I don't know...

...how he lived through it.
I don't know.

I never saw him. I heard about him
from letters.

When I came to this country,
he wasn't born.

And when he was old enough to come...

...he wouldn't leave my father.
No, he was blind and dying.

And then the war started.

So where is your brother now?

I don't know. With refugees.

But now they found me...

...they make plans for him
to come to America.

It's 4-1.

And after the concentration camp...

...he's put in a camp
with the displaced people.

Now he says he has a sister
in Baltimore...

...but he can't remember
my married name: Krichinsky.

Doesn't have his letters anymore.
They were all destroyed.

He knows the name's Russian,
not Polish.

It's a Y, not an I,
but he can't remember the name.

I cannot imagine having a brother
I've never seen.

Never seen.

Thought was dead.

All right, Michael.
Give me your best shot.

That's an out.

Oh, my God.

Bees!

Bees!

Bees! Bees! Bees!

Stand still!
You're supposed to stand still!

Run, run!

Bees! Bees! Bees!

Oh, my God!

Get the hose!

Run, Michael!

Put your hands over your eyes.
Don't let them get in your eyes.

He's not allergic to the bees,
so there's no real problem.

He's just gonna be a little
uncomfortable for a while.

I hate the suburbs.

I'm surprised your mother-in-law
didn't come along with you today.

She refuses to get in the car with me.

She's never been in a car
when a woman drives.

One, two, three.

Jump!

The election of a new family-circle
president will take place...

...three weeks from Sunday.

So we have to make some serious
decision-making.

It's like a furnace in here.
Like a furnace.

That concludes old business.

I make a proposal that we take
the next meeting at Frock's Farm.

Very good idea.
I'm with you.

A very good idea.

It's cooler. We won't
suffocate to death.

This is a family-circle meeting,
not an outing.

Why not combine the two
when it's this hot?

An outing and a family-circle meeting.

An outing is an outing, and
a family circle is a family circle.

I'm dripping.

Let's finish the meeting
and that'll be it.

And that will be it.
That will be it.

When Schulman was alive,
we sat in the meeting.

The meeting finished.
Then we left.

It was hot, it was cold,
it was snow...

...it was rain.
We sat and we had a meeting.

If we don't want to meet because
it's hot, let's not meet.

Do not meet.
No one said not to meet.

Nobody said not to meet.

It's a furnace.

We need to decide how much money
we'll give to our charity this year.

This is a heat wave.

It was hotter at Avalon.

We had a meeting and it was
so hot you couldn't stand up.

What are you talking about?
Aunt Molly fainted.

Still, we had the meeting.

Last year we gave--
Just let me have a look.

We gave to six charities.

An elephant just went by the window.

What?

It's the heat.
You're hallucinating.

Then the heat made me see another
elephant, because another is going by.

The circus! The circus!

The circus!

The circus!

Oh, look at this!

They must be going through here
to get to the tent site.

What tent?
They have a tent at Edmondson Avenue.

Wow, look at the circus, Mom!

The circus is coming.

Yeah! Yeah!

Do you got everything?

You'll waste the battery.

And remember, you stay with Sam.
Okay.

Don't wander off around
the reservoir without him, understand?

We know. We know.

Later, I'll make you breakfast.

In the old days, it used to be
hotter in the summertime.

Did I tell you my father
never drank water in America?

The whole time he was alive,
he never drank water in America.

What did he drink? Coca-Cola?

Whiskey.

If he didn't drink whiskey,
mineral water.

But he never drank...

...from the faucet.

Why?

He had the old ways. You see,
we drank from a well.

Spring water in the old country.
And he said:

"Water that comes through a pipe under
the city can't be good water.

Can't be good for you."

He was a very stubborn man.

And we never could convince him
otherwise.

Your grandmother
is a stubborn woman.

We know.

We know.

Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael.

I came to America in 1914.

And when I came to Baltimore...

...it was the most beautiful place
you ever saw.

We know that story, Sam.
Can you tell us another one?

Yeah, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

Did I tell you I used to
own a nightclub?

You used to own a nightclub?

Yeah, yeah. Not a big nightclub.

A small place
on lower Pennsylvania Avenue.

It had a bar and a dance floor.

You went off and got married?

You see, we didn't plan
to get married.

They decided to get married. We
were taking them to get married.

We were getting married. Jules
has the car, so he gave us a ride.

Because you needed a ride,
my son is married?

No, well, we sort of got
caught up in the moment.

Yes, it was very...
Well, you know.

We were gonna marry
sooner or later.

Sooner or later?
We got a deal too.

The justice of the peace
charges $10 a couple.

I got him down to $15 for
the whole thing.

It's wonderful.
A bargain wedding.

You save $5 by getting married.
I am so pleased.

Come on, Dad. Be happy for us.

Do you love my boy?

Yes, I do, very much.

Good. Because that's one
young man that's crazy about you.

Kiss the bride.
Let me see you kiss the bride.

Izzy, kiss your bride.

That's it, that's it, that's it!

Dad, if it's all right, she's gonna
sleep at the house tonight.

Where is that marriage certificate?
Let me see it.

Let me see it.
Here.

I don't want any hanky-panky
going on in my house.

Who's this?
Who's this Jules Kaye here?

That's me, Dad.

I changed my name.

Me too. I changed mine to Kirk.

It's easier to say than Krichinsky.
Kirk. It's better.

Who said names are supposed to
be easy to say?

What are you, a candy bar?

You got a name: Krichinsky.
It's a name.

Kaye. Kirk.

Two cousins, different names.

How can this be a family when the
father is called Sam Krichinsky...

...his son is called Jules Kaye
and his first cousin is Izzy Kirk.

This is a family, goddamn it!
Krichinsky is the name of the family!

It's not Kaye! It's not Kirk!
It's Krichinsky!

It's Krichinsky.

We argued and argued.

Then the way things are in life,
you stop arguing.

It's your life.
You're gonna have to live it.

What a celebration.
And we celebrated that night.

<i>It wasn't your ordinary
family celebration.</i>

It was the best wedding...

...I ever went to.

It's nice.

It's easy to sleep when you have
a breeze. It's easy to sleep.

<i>I'm getting nervous.
Too much expansion.</i>

<i>We bought out that store and that one.
We got all this merchandise.</i>

Nothing's ready, we got no customers.
Money's going out, not coming in.

I'm getting a little nervous.
You're not the only one.

I've talked to some of the people
around here in the marketplace...

...and I'm not sure anyone knows
what this "discount" is.

I don't know whether it means
anything to anybody.

It's not like we invented the word.

I didn't say that,
but it doesn't mean anything.

What are you saying?

I'm saying we need to be more clear.

We need a catchy slogan or something.
More clear than discount?

More clear than discount.
Something that--

All right. You want a catchy slogan?
How about:

"Guaranteed lowest prices in town."

That's good.

A little higher! Higher!

Higher! A little higher!

What if someone buys and it's cheaper?

Cheaper than they guaranteed is
the lower price. What do you do then?

Jules, what happens if somebody buys
cheaper than what you sell?

Good question. What if they get it
cheaper someplace else...

...since we guarantee
the lowest prices in town?

Find somewhere else cheaper,
then we'll match it at that price.

That's good. We'll match it!

They'll match it?
What does that mean?

Whatever the guy buys somewhere else
he can get here for the same price.

What the hell does he need to
do that for?

He bought it, and then they guarantee
they'll give him the same price.

That makes no sense. He's gotta
take it back to the shop...

...and then get it here?
Why wouldn't that make sense?

They'd guarantee it?
Yes.

They'd guarantee it.
Maybe make it lower.

How much lower? Because if it's
a nickel lower...

...I won't take it all the way back
to get it here for a nickel less.

A little higher!

Can we just put up the sign?

Is it me,
or does it look a little low?

No, it's still low. It's low.

I gotta go to the doctor's, then pick
up the kids from the movie around 4.

The movies?
Yeah.

From 10 in the morning to 4?
What do they watch, 9 movies?

You're going to the doctor's?

Just a checkup.
What time will you be home?

I'll be home probably around 7.

Can you see if my mother wants to go
back with you? Please?

What are they doing? They're arguing
again. Arguing again.

You want to ride back with me?

With you?

Yeah.

No, I think it's still too soon.

I've been driving for six months.
No, still too soon.

You gotta go all the way uptown.
Lot of turns to make. It's too soon.

You'll have to wait till 7:00.
That's when Jules is going home.

I'll take a streetcar.
It's on tracks.

You take the 32 and you're there.

All right. Fine.

Higher!

I cannot believe your mother.
She's not going with you?

No, I haven't been driving
long enough for her.

<i>What's that?</i>

I wonder how long it'll be
until we get our own rocket suits.

It'll be great.

We'll be able to rocket to school
and rocket back home.

It will be great.

I'd love to see my grandmother
rocketing to the store to get bread.

Go, Rocket Man!

Yeah!

Hi, will you fill her up?
I'm going to get my kids.

Sure.
I'll be right back.

Oh, I can't see.

It's because you've been sitting in
a dark movie theater all afternoon.

<i>I can't believe this.
Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

<i>What are you saying?
That it's my fault?</i>

I'm not saying it's your fault.

You say it like it's my fault
that the streetcar smashed my car.

I'm not saying it's your fault.
No, you took the car and it got hit.

And I could have been sitting in it.
You don't understand.

You make it sound as if I'm
responsible, as if it's my fault.

I've been in this country 40 years.

I've never seen a streetcar jump
the track and hit a car.

Am I crazy, or does it sound
like it's my fault?

You're being sensitive.
She's not blaming you.

You're not blaming her, are you?
No, no, I'm not blaming her.

What I'm saying is, they should
get rid of the streetcars.

They got buses.
Why do they need streetcars?

The tracks are too slippery.

I don't even like Sam
to drive in the rain.

The tracks is dangerous. When it
gets wet, it gets too slippery.

Do you know anyone whose car got hit
by a streetcar off its tracks?

It's a first.

To think I could've been
sitting in that car.

Thank God I didn't get into
that machine.

I cannot believe this conversation.

Can we put the streetcar talk to rest?

We're lucky it was nothing serious.
That's the end of it.

You should've seen it, Dad.
It was just like the cliffhangers.

Michael!

Ellen Ferguson.
What?

Ellen Ferguson's car got hit
by a streetcar.

It wasn't a streetcar.
It was a train.

Off of Saratoga. Freight train.
It wasn't a streetcar.

It wasn't a streetcar?
It was a train.

Do you know where my coat is?

In the back closet.
It was too crowded.

Never has there been a streetcar
jumped its tracks.

Now, a train has jumped its tracks,
but never a streetcar.

I circulated over 10,000 fliers for
the opening of the new store, Dad.

I never believed in fliers.

If people don't pay for something,
they won't bother reading it.

The newspaper you pay for,
then you read an ad.

Let's hope you're wrong, because we
can't afford newspaper ads.

You can gamble, you're young. You make
mistakes, you can always start again.

See what Solomon did. He could have
stayed in the shoe business...

...but he gambled. Today, he's got--

One of Baltimore's
biggest department stores.

That is true.
I can't find the coat.

Oh, God. I sent it to the cleaners.

Dad, where's the keys to your car?

Here.

You ready, hon?

I'm just putting on my coat.

Michael, be good.
I will.

Don't be late.

And it's true with Solomon.

I'm about this far away
from losing my mind.

Thank you.

Want pictures here? Pictures?

Pictures? Pictures?

Pictures?
No, thank you.

Pictures here? All right.

Pictures here?

Can I get a picture?

All right. Come on.
Everybody smile.

Don't laugh.

I'm not laughing.

Yes, you are. I can see it.

Miss? Miss?
Let's do it again.

What do you want?
My eyes weren't open.

They were fine.
What's your problem?

I'm getting nervous.

You? You getting nervous?

He makes me nervous.

We're back to
the business again.

He started it.

What?
No, no, no.

Maybe the customers won't show.

We're expanding. We're getting in
over-- You getting this?

It was a genuine concern,
and it remains a genuine concern.

Genuine concern? That I like.

Genuine concern. Very nice phrase.

I have to admit, he tends to be
on the conservative side.

If this expansion doesn't go over...

...we're out of the suburbs
and back into row houses, huh?

That's a genuine concern.

We'll toast to genuine concerns.
It's been acknowledged.

No, let's toast to the suburbs,
shall we?

Better.

Honey, don't count.
Just...

Am I doing good?

You're doing wonderful.
Thank you.

Who would've thought that this bargain
marriage would have lasted this long?

You know, I didn't get a chance
to tell you before, but...

But what?

What?
I'm pregnant.

You're what?

I am pregnant. I'm pregnant.

You're kidding?
No, I am not kidding.

You have great news
and you wait until now to tell me?

I would've told you sooner, but the
streetcar discussion got in the way.

It didn't seem like the proper time
to get in the fact...

...that I'm pregnant again.

Let's face it, the streetcar
story was all-consuming.

Honey, this is great news.

Let's do that promenade thing.

Please. It's bad enough
over there.

What is this?

What is this?

There's a lot of people for something.

This is us.

This is for us!

Discount is here.
Oh, this is good.

Look at this!
This is good.

Don't go anywhere,
we're coming right out!

But I don't even know what
he looks like.

Where are the people who
know where the people are?

Simka.
