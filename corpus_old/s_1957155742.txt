Bruce Wayne.

[speaking Icelandic]

[speaks Icelandic]

[in English] Talk.

I believe there is a stranger.

Comes to this village
from the sea.

He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

He brings fish.

He comes on the king tide.

That was last night.

[Arthur speaking Icelandic]

[in English]
You have eyes, so see.

Icebergs in the harbor.

It's four months since
the last ship got through.

Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

[speaking Icelandic]

[in English] There are enemies
coming from far away.

I need warriors.

This stranger, others like him.

I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

It's very important
that I see this man.

If this stranger exists,

he'll give him your message.

$5,000 American.

Look, I'll give you $25,000

to talk to this man
right now, outside.

[speaking Icelandic]


[villagers laughing]

[in English] How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

Ooh, magical man from the sea.

We are poor, not stupid.

Get out.

I'm sorry.

Can't do that.

I'll leave after we've spoken.

He said, "Get out."

[speaks Icelandic]

[both grunt]

[villagers exclaim]
[Arthur breathes heavily]

Arthur Curry.

Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

The Aquaman.

[birds calling]

get this straight.

You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

Oh, that shithole.

When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

Don't count on it, Batman.
Why not?

'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

Is that why you do this?

Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

I've read the stories.

Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

You'll join us.

"Strong man
is strongest alone."

You ever heard that?

of Superman?

He died fighting next to me.

My point exactly.

He believed
we were stronger together.

We owe it to him.

I don't owe anyone anything.

Dressed like a bat.

You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

Maybe we can catch

Might be

Costa Rica's nice.

I found him.

He said no.

So the draft stands
at naught for two?

Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

That's $10, please.

He will be pleased.

He will see my worth again.

"Possibly."

Yeah, it would make you

to confirm.
We don't have any more time.

Master Wayne,

you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

to build this team

of people you can't even find.

I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

Just because Lex Luthor says

the planet's
in danger of attack?

This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

It has to do with him.

I made a promise to him
on his grave.

I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

I need to bring us together
and make this right.

Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

Maybe they're already here.

Keep looking.
What else do you have?

Lab's all yours, Howard.


Early night for you, Silas.

Yes, early night.

Tell your family I said hello.

Nothing very interesting.

That's all you ever tell us.

I'm not that exciting.

You might as well disappear

This world is divided.

I have found one of the three.

DeSaad...

Let me make a plea to him

that I may come home

in his name.

You betrayed him.

Your own family.

I saw my mistake.

I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

He will hear your plea

when you pay your debt.

The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

No protectors here.

No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

They serve a dark power.

I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

[vehicle horn blaring]
[tires screeching]

[car crashes]

I'm sorry,</i>

your wife didn't survive.

I'm afraid
your son won't either.


[voice breaking]
I won't let you die.


I won't allow it.

I won't allow it.

Victor.

Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

You still have a life
ahead of you.

Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

[Victor scoffs]

If you were there,

Mom would still be alive.

All right, look,

you don't have to give me
a second chance,

but give yourself one.

If you can't stand
looking at me,

try listening.

[door opens and closes]

[Silas over tape]
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

[metal clanking]

[blasters powering up]
[exhales nervously]



[breathes nervously]


of ones and zeroes,</i>

<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>

<i>everyone's lives are controlled</i>

<i>and dominated
by complex digital networks</i>

<i>that will bend
without effort to your will.</i>

<i>The fate of the world</i>

<i>will literally
rest in your hands.</i>


<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

<i>you could launch with a thought.</i>


[bear growling]
[metal clanking]

<i>The world's monetary systems</i>

<i>and its complex interactions</i>

<i>will seem as easy
to manipulate for you</i>

<i>as a child's plaything.</i>


<i>The question...
No, the challenge</i>

<i>won't be doing it.</i>

<i>It will be not doing.</i>

<i>Not seeing.</i>

<i>It is the burden
of this responsibility</i>

<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>


[child blows air]

<i>One more time.</i>

<i>Good job. Wave to Grandma!</i>

<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>



Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!


<i>Victor, these are the words</i>
and deductions of a scientist.

<i>That's how I've been
speaking to you.</i>

<i>Now,</i>

[continues over tape] <i>let me speak to
you from my heart, not as a scientist,</i>

<i>as a father.</i>

[parademon screeches]


Hey, you!

[hand blaster charging up]

[siren wailing]

[parademon snarls]

[hand blaster powers down]

holding yourself back.</i>

You're going in circles, man.

Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

going on four.

Where do you even find the time?


I just need one more gig...
Barry.

...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.


I would.

You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

Please, we have 10 minutes.
And this is all to pay

for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

Yeah.

For what?

Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

who's still in prison
for the murder

of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

I can't remember.

Oh, boy.

This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

Give me your hand, man.

to listen to me, Barry.

I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

I want you to give all that up.

And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

I am a drag on your life.


Okay. Um...

Please don't ever
say that to me again.

Please.

Hey, you know what
criminal justice

would be for me?

My son not wasting his life.

You can be
whatever you wanna be.

You're brilliant, man.

Absolute best of the best.

I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

for some old dude

who's not going anywhere.

Dad, that's not true.
[prison guard] It's time.

That's not true.

[prison guard]
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

I want you
to make your own future.

You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

[prison guard] Open gate.

Great.

[gate buzzing]

"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

[prison guard] Clear.
Close the gate.

[gate closes]

[train horn blaring]

[locks door]

[opens electric panel]

[system powers up]

Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

You said that like it explains

why there's a total stranger
in my place

sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

[paper rustles]

Tell me about this.

This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

but who is definitely not me.

Somebody... I don't know.

Hippie, long hair.

Very attractive Jewish boy.

Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

I know you have abilities.

I just don't know what they are.

My special skills

include viola, web design,

fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

sand quartz fabric.

Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

It's what they use
on the space shuttle

to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

I do very competitive
ice dancing.

Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

but whoever you're looking for,

it's not me.

[electricity crackles]

[exhales sharply]

You're the Batman?

So, you're fast.

That feels
like an oversimplification.

I'm putting together a team.

People with special abilities.

You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

Stop right there. I'm in.

You are?

Just like that?

Yeah. [hesitates]

I need friends.

Great. Great.

Can I keep this?

It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

I call it the Speed Force.

Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

I am a snack hole.

How many people are
on this special fight team?

Three, including you.
Three?

Against what?

I'll tell you on the plane.

Plane?

What are your superpowers again?

I'm rich.

[engine starts]

[tires screeching]

[car horn blares]

[kettle whistles]

[whistling stops]

Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

I can do it myself.

to have some?

Uh, no, thank you.

If you put the water in first.

[Diana] Of course.
So we don't scald the tea.

Yes.
Great.

No, that's probably enough tea.


Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

I will.
I will, definitely will.

Uh... What are you working on?

It's a gauntlet

lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

Wow.
Here, let me show you.

We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

[Alfred chuckles]

Oh, maybe you should, uh...

a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

Of course.

[buzzing and crackling]


Ah, now, let's see how that did.

[device beeps]
Ha! Yes.

Not to be sneezed at.

A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

It's Master Wayne's idea.

Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

In black, of course.
Oh.


All right. Victor Stone.
[typing]


Something is not working.


[system warbling]

Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

[car door closes]

[electricity crackles]

Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

You know who I am.

I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

The world does.

Fuck the world.

been through a great deal.

I can't begin to imagine what.

But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

Gifts?

What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

We need you, Victor.

And maybe you need us.

I don't need anyone.

Not anymore.

I told myself the same
for a long time.

I lost someone I loved once.

I shut myself off from everyone.

But I had to learn
to open back up again.

The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

And if you asked to meet me...

you're working on it, too.


You were right
about the metal sample

from the Superman ship.

When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

look what happens.

[computer beeps]

[laser whooshing]

3.5 million kelvin.

The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

Hot, dense matter.

You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

Exact words I said
to my prom date.

She dumped me anyway.

Yeah.

[laser shuts down]

Hey, Doc,

do you think Batman is connected

to the object
the CID is looking for?

You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

No...

I don't.

Oh, Victor.

[parademon snarling]

[gasps]
[parademon screeches]

[both grunting]


[female officer]
Commissioner Gordon?


Your messages.

[officer 2] Hey, hey!

[thug grunting]

Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

What's wrong with dental school?

"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

On a possibly related note,

sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

at the lab across the harbor.

Looks like...
I know what it looks like, Crispus.

Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

I'll talk to him tonight.

How, Jim?

How do you think?

[parademons chittering]

[Silas whimpering]

[Silas yelps]



Hey, hey!

[Barry] Oh, my goodness.
[Bruce] Where's the cyborg?

His name is Victor.

We met, spoke.

Give him time.

You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

[sighs] So, this is us.
[Bruce] Yeah, this is us.

Oh!

Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

Oh, sorry.

That means we have to go now.

Yeah, that's what that means.
It's so cool. [chuckles]

[Mother Box pulsing]

[Mera trilling]

[Atlantean soldier trilling]

Commander Mera, I told the king

the perimeter guards were taken.

He won't send reinforcements.

He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel. [sighs]

All right, take what men
we have left

and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

[loud thud]


[pulsing intensifies]



[Atlantean soldier screams]


[Atlantean soldier screams]

[laser firing]
[growls]

[Mera groaning]

You can't escape.

I'm not trying to.

[Mera grunts]

[Mera groans]


[both grunting]

[portal booms]

you would come.

The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

Wait.

Please.

I knew her.

Well, that makes one of us.

My parents died in the wars.

She took me in.

What a saint.

You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

and never gave me
another thought.

Your mother left you
to save your life.

You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

What it cost her.

But you're not
a defenseless child now.

It would have been
her responsibility

to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

Now,

it's yours.


[Victor gasps softly]

[sirens wailing at distance]

[Mother Box sizzles]

Yes.

[Mother Boxes warbling]


tell me what you've learned.

found and awake.

With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

Where is the third Mother Box?

The parademons
sense its presence

and search for the third.

They have taken prisoners

who carry its scent.

Go.

Interrogate the prisoners.

Find the third.

They will tell me
what they know,

or I will rip it from them.

[thunder crashes]

[thunder crashes]

[electricity crackles]

How many of you are there?

Not enough.

all over Gotham.

Description matches the suspect

in the Metropolis abductions.

Parademons.

Okay.

The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

[The Flash] At the lab.

They carried people away
to find out what they know.

So the eight may still be alive.


[The Flash gasps] Oh.

The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

So, how do we find him?

There must be a nest nearby.

I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

No discernable pattern
I can see.

The lines on the map
don't converge.

On land.

These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

between the two cities.

These are air vents.

They all lead down to the tunnel

to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

[Wonder Woman]
The nest could be there.

[The Flash] Uh,
is he coming with us now,

because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

I have something bigger.

Do you really think that...

Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

Oh. That's rude.

[rats squeaking]

[door whirs]

[dramatic rock music playing]

We're close.

The scent of the enemy.

Of absence.

Darkness.

Death.

Where are we, Alfred?

[Alfred over radio]
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

You should be directly under

the venting tower
for the tunnel.

<i>Now look to your left,</i>

<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>

<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>


Let's go.

[dramatic rock music resumes]

[The Flash] Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

Either of you?

[Wonder Woman]
Don't engage alone.

We do this together.

I heard about you.

Didn't think you were real.

I'm real when it's useful.

I grow tired of your silence.

Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

[parademons chittering]

[hostages whimpering]

Please. We have families.

Then you have weakness.

Steppenwolf.

Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

Good guess.

I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

Circle to the other side.

We'll surround them
and surprise him.


You have been near a Mother Box.

The scent is on you.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Where is it?
[Silas] Leave him alone!

He... He doesn't know.

[hostages exclaim]


[hostages whimpering]

[Silas grunting]

the scent, too. But stronger.

I will die before I tell you.

You'll die if you don't.

No!

[all exclaim]

Victor.


[weapon whirs]

[Wonder Woman grunts]

Ah, Amazon.

But not like your sisters.

Stronger.


[ancient lamentation music
playing]

[Steppenwolf sighing]

[Wonder Woman grunts]




Amazon. [grunts]

Hold!

This one will be mine.

I belong to no one.

[both grunting]

[Batman grunting]

Guys, this is not together.

Help get those people
out of here.

I'll make sure these things
follow me. [grunts]




A little quicker.

Are you good?
Yeah.

I've got this. Keep moving.

[The Flash] This way.


[both grunting]



[Steppenwolf grunting]

is dissipating.

<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

Thought you'd never ask.

Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

[both grunting]

[engine revving]

Thank you, Alfred.

Don't mention it.

[Steppenwolf chuckles]


[Steppenwolf grunts]

No!

Whew.

They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

[both grunting]

[parademons screeching]

My turn.

[pants, grunts]


[ancient lamentation music
playing]

[dramatic orchestral music
playing]



of all systems.

Are you all right, Master Wayne?

Are you all right?



[ancient lamentation music
playing]

You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

[both grunt]


You okay?

Mm.

Wasn't sure you'd come.

You're my father.

Go.


[yells in pain]

[parademon screeches]

No!

[The Flash screams]

[parademon screeches]


I'll take it from here.

Uh, do I know you?




What are we under, right now?

Gotham Harbor.

[orchestral music playing]



Who is that?



Diana, get on!



[The Flash panting]




What is it?

Show me.


[grunts softly]

It is here.

On this world.


[breathing heavily]


[helicopter whirring]

Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

for possible alien microbes.

U.S. government protocols
require that...

I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

[Wonder Woman]
It called to him.

The Mother Box.

The one he already has.

He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

If he doesn't already have it.

He doesn't have it.

I do.

Have you finished the conquest?

Not yet, DeSaad.

Then why do you summon me?

I bring news.

Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

The Anti-Life Equation.

The key to controlling all life

and all will
throughout the multiverse.

He found it hidden on a
primitive planet, but before...

The story of the defiance
is well-known.

I have found
the primitive planet.

The world that fought back.

It is Earth.

The Anti-Life Equation is carved

into the surface
of this very world.


Are you certain?

I have seen it.

I have looked with my own eyes.

[speaks alien language]

[Steppenwolf speaks alien language]
Anti-Life.

[speaking alien language]


[parademons chittering]

[dramatic orchestral music
playing]


My lord.

Oh, Steppenwolf.

but your humble servant.

Can it be true
that you have found it?

I have, great one.

The lost world is Earth.

Anti-Life is here.

If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

synchronize The Unity, and
when this world is scorched,

I will come for my great prize.

You will come to Earth?

I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

looking for Anti-Life.

Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

I will stride across their bones

and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

And all of existence

shall be mine.

[grunts softly]

It shall be so, my master.


From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

It wants to fly.

You talk to machines?

to intelligence.

This one's saying she can't fly

because of a software issue,

but I could fix it
with a little time.

There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

I could feel
the other two boxes.

I know they're awake,

but I can't see where they are.

Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

Even if we knew,

I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

Maybe one.

Hmm, Superman.

the third box is asleep,

they can't see it,
only sense it.

We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

No. That's just a strategy

to lose more slowly, not to win.

Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

Why don't we just destroy it?

Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

They're an unknown form
of matter.

Oh, they love heat.

They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

Makes you think.

Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

Are you trying to say something?

Oh, I'm saying it.

How do we know you're not
working for them?

It's a long story.

You got somewhere else to be?

The Nazis found the box

at the end
of the Second World War,

buried under
an Italian monastery.

The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

They brought it back
to the States in '44.

Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

for 70 years

till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

between the ship...

and 6-1-9-8-2.

He understood they were
both alien technologies.

Different civilizations,

similar properties.

And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

And so did.

Then...

I had an accident
that should've killed me.

But in an act of desperation
or madness,

the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

[powering up]


He unleashed an alien technology

he didn't fully understand.

He used that power
to keep me alive.

[groans]
[power turns off]

Alive...

but turned into this.

The box went back to sleep

and he never returned it.

That researcher was Silas Stone.

My father.

Wait,

your father saved your life
with one of these things?

Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

They're change machines.

The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

alive or dead.

They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

regenerate, reinstate.

Reinstate?


to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

can't be created or destroyed,

their relations just transform.

Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

But a Mother Box...

...turns smoke
back into a house.


I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

[orchestral music playing]


Martha.

Hi.


I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

to finally pick up
Clark's things. [chuckles]

I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

I lost the farm.

I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

Truth is, the house is too big

for me to live in
by myself anyway.

Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

for as long as you need.

Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

right by the diner.

I'm not here for help.

I'm here because

when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

[sighs softly]

I can't.

The whole world is mourning.


Grieving over a symbol.

Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

I hear what people say.

They talk like they knew him.

But they didn't know Clark.

And I can't stop them

and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

You're the only one who knows.

Who feels what I do.

Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

I came all this way
because I wanted...

because I wanted to see you.

Tell you...

I understand.

I...

will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

And I just miss him.

I miss him so much.

[Lois sniffles]

So do I, sweetheart.


Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

There is something
you can do for me, honey.

Come back to the living.

[door opens]

[suspenseful music plays]

The world needs you, too, Lois.


The box brought Victor back.

Victor wasn't dead.

Life is either one or zero.

It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

Can you operate this box,
Victor?


But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

[Diana sighs]
[Barry] Okay, but...

I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

What do we have to lose?

We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

As soon as it wakes up...

...the enemy sees it, comes,

activates The Unity.
The end.

So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

to a bunch of genocidal
aliens. That's good to know.

Even if Superman could return,

who's to say
that he could defeat them?

The Mother Box did.

Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

None of the boxes did.
Not until...

Not until Superman died.

Not until Superman died.

It's like they were
afraid of him?

they were afraid of him.

This is the only way.

There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

the bucket list.

Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

We could.

He was my hero.

All right.

An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

Half-Atlantean.

How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

Hate is useless.

Yep.

No, thank you.

You know, my father told me

there's a saying in Atlantis...

"None are taken back
from the darkness.

"Not without..."

"Not without
giving one up in return."

We say the same thing.

How about that?

Wonder Woman.

What do you think, man?

You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

Every guy's a younger guy.


[steam hissing]

Oh, Christ.

[blasting]
Oh, bloody...

Any luck?

If by "luck" you mean

"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

then, no. No luck.


It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

to the Kryptonian ship.

It's basically
an organic computer.

It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?


What could possibly go wrong?

[Alfred sighing]

Master Wayne...

you did it!

You put the team together
to fight this war.

You've fulfilled your promise.

But to try to do that...
I mean...

your guilt's
overcome your reason.

Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

not on reason.

But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

How do you know
your team's strong enough?

If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

then don't wave
the red cape at it.

You do when it's this red cape.

This red cape charges back.

Okay.

You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

Everyone's clear, including you.

Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

Absolutely.

Thanks.
Listen up, everyone.

You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

If you need
more medical attention...

Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

Definitely not "A."
Okay.

Or... "B"?

Let me see "A" again?

Right. We should get dressed.

I'm always dressed.

[dramatic music playing]


ID.

Aye, aye.


[system buzzes]

[electrical whirring]


"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

Doc!

They let you out of quarantine.

Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

with the electron-laser.

We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

[Batman grunts softly]

Victor, clear this place out.

Done.

[electrical whirring]

[alarm blaring]

[PA announcer] <i>Code Red.
Contamination breach.</i>

<i>All personnel
evacuate immediately.</i>

[people murmuring]
[Ryan] Bio red five.

The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

It's gotta be a false alarm.

All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

Ryan, we just had it swept.
We have to go, Doc.

Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

Let's go, Doc.
Think about it.

Everyone out!

Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

[PA announcer] <i>Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

[scientists clamoring]

<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

Move! Come on! Go, go!

Everybody out! Go!

[system beeps]
Yes! Gotcha!

Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

[man] <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
This is a false alarm.

Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

[door opens]

Victor.

I don't copy.</i>

I was mistaken.

The alarm's legit.

Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.


[officer 1]
Get the civilians out!

[officer 2] Let's go! Let's go!

Everybody got out okay?
I think so.

Everybody?
Yes.

[electrical hum]

[clears throat]

This way.

It knows he's here.

[exhales heavily]
Ooh, that's intense.

This is amazing.

This is crazy.

Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

[soft orchestral music playing]

[grunts softly]


[breathes deeply]

[switch clicks]

[soft orchestral music
continues]

[ship AI]
<i>Systems coming online.</i>


<i>Would you like
to assume command?</i>

I'm in.

The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

I can override
the security protocols,

but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

that Luthor's
power surges caused

to the primary capacitors.

English.

There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

[inhales sharply]
I might be able to do it.

I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

I don't like to break this rule,

but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

Look, crazy things
happen to time,

but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

still what we want?

It is. Do it.

[inhales sharply]


Morning.

I didn't think you were coming.


[somber orchestral music
playing]

I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

[over radio] <i>I'm in position.</i>

[electrical hum]

[ship AI] <i>Ready to initiate
drop sequence.</i>

The Mother Box is ready.

[somber orchestral music
continues]

The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

[ship AI] <i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

Steppenwolf will come for it.

We know that already.
Continue.

[ship AI] <i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

[ship AI] <i>This action

This is a bad idea.

No, it isn't.
Keep going.

[ship AI] <i>I strongly advise

We need to abort, now.
Just do it.

[somber orchestral music

[breathing heavily]

He's back.

[static crackles,
indistinct radio chatter]

[siren wailing]
[rapid heartbeat]

He's scanning us.

What?


Victor?

Victor?

[continues grunting]

Shit.
What are you doing?

It's my auto-defense system.

It senses danger.

Victor, no! Victor!

I can't control it.
[The Flash] Don't!


[breathes heavily]

Kal-El, no!

[Cyborg grunting]


He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.



Arthur, we need to restrain him.

[all grunting]



Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

Tell me who you...

[grunts]
[Wonder Woman yelps]

[all grunting]

[slowed electrical warbling]

[The Flash grunting]

[The Flash yelps]




Let's go! [screams]

[breathes shakily]

[Cyborg grunts]

You should probably move.

[officers shouting indistinctly]

You all right?
Yeah.

Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

[tense music playing]


[both straining]

[metallic thud]

[dramatic music playing]

[both grunt]

Please don't make me do this.



[Wonder Woman grunts]
[breathes heavily]

[grunts]
[groans]

Clark.

Clark, no.



Clark.

No.

This world needs you.


Clark.

Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

[Lois panting]


[soft music playing]

Please.

[exhales deeply]


Please.

[Lois breathing shakily]

Please.

Just go.

Yeah.

Let's go.

[Clark inhales deeply]

[distant thud]

[The Flash groaning]

[breathes heavily]

I'm so sorry.


[indistinct shouting]


He's coming.
The Mother Box.

Where is it?

Come on.

Come on.

[Steppenwolf grunts]
[people screaming]

[Steppenwolf breathing heavily]

No, no, no.

[Steppenwolf grunts]
[Cyborg groans]

[grunts, breathes heavily]

[electricity crackling]

So begins the end.

[portal booming]

[The Flash] Victor?

Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

Victor?

He's dead.

What?

My father.

I didn't save him. I couldn't.

[The Flash] Oh, my God.

[breathes heavily]

His father's dead 'cause of us.

I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

It wasn't a bad idea.

We needed Superman.
We still do.

returned, it isn't Superman.

His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.


He recognized Lois Lane.

Who?
The woman he loves.

He remembers her.
[Aquaman] Nah.

He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

It's called instinct, Diana.

[Aquaman sighs]

[The Flash] Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

[Wonder Woman]
He's gone back to his base

to assemble the three boxes.

where his base is.

Or how long until...
[Batman] Hours.

The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.



He knew.

He knew, he knew, he knew.

He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

he was trying to superheat it.

He made the core
the hottest thing

on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

Now, anything that hot
would have to...

Blink off the charts

on a thermal imaging system.

Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

I'm already on it.

I'm sorry. [hesitates]
You have a satellite?

I have six.

Right.

Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

[birds chirping]

[soft music playing]

You brought us here.

You remembered.

This is home.

You spoke.

Did I not before?

Your mother got behind
on the payments.

She never told anyone.

I don't understand.

She's a proud woman, Clark.

Here.

She loved it here.

[birds chirping]

So did I.

So did I.

[Clark sighs]

[The Flash] Wow!

This is awesome.


Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

Alfred.
Good day, ma'am.


[Alfred clears throat]

It's badass, Alfred.

Well, I'll put on the tea.

Great.

I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

Mother Box, right there.

[Wonder Woman]
Go to visible spectrum.


Ghost city not far from Moscow.

It's been abandoned since

the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

Not even the army goes in.

so radioactive

that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

Not anymore.

He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

Zoom.

[keyboard clacking]

What the hell is he building?


We'll attack from above.

Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

only strengthen their bond.

So we can't blow it up?


I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

Fuse with it.

Weaken its bond from the inside

so we can break it back
into three.

No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

These boxes together
are world destroyers.

A billion years old.

They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

Just get me in and get me time.

You could die, Victor.

If I don't, we all die.
Period.

I got nothing left.

You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

That's what I'm gonna do.


if Victor wants
to try to save the world

by fusing with the doom boxes,

I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

But getting him in
means attacking that base.

Fighting the devil and his army

in hell.

this guy's probably fought

hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

And we have to assume he's won.

I don't care
how many demons he's fought

in how many hells...

he's never fought us.
Not us united.

[hopeful music plays]

[soft music playing]

Take that as a "yes."


The ring.

You're really back.

I have a second chance, Lo.

And I am not gonna waste it.

[gasps softly]

[Martha laughing]
[chuckles]

Are you really you?

I'm really me, Ma.

[Martha laughs]

Listen, Ma.

They wanted me back
for a reason.

I need to find out why.

[Martha sighs]

How's Victor doing?

You know,
wanted to be by himself.

We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

to go up against
the most powerful machines

in the universe.

It's not fair.

I thought you didn't care?

I never said that.

What is it?

Uh...

I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

almost like a premonition.

It was the end of the world

and Barry Allen was right here

and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

She is... to Superman.

Every heart has one.

I think it's something more.

Something darker.

Master Wayne.

Master Wayne!

You need to see this.

[triumphant music playing]

You fixed it.

It wanted to fly.

Flight is its nature.

Yours, too.

He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

What makes you so sure?

Faith, Alfred. Faith.

At last.

Prepare for his arrival.

My redemption is nigh.

Unite.

Synchronize.

[distant explosion]

[ancient lamentation
music playing]

[distant explosion]

[Alfred humming]

[distant explosion]

[Mother Boxes pinging]

The satellites revealed

he's created a defensive dome.

It's a design flaw.

Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

[The Flash] Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

anyone would be that nuts.

Bruce is right.

We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

What if the dome's
not destroyed?

It'll be destroyed.

[Wonder Woman] Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

with Barry's help,

he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

how's that again?

Uh, with the power of love.

Barry.
With a catastrophic energy surge.

Good.

You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

to generate
a charge of that size.

And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

And, Victor, it's all up to you.

Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

[The Flash] Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

[Jor-El] <i>Love them, Kal.</i>

<i>It's time.</i>

[upbeat music playing]


[exhales deeply]

I'm gonna take out that tower

and knock down that shield dome.

Whatever you see,

stick to the plan.

It's why I brought you together.

[clicks button]

[rapid electronic beeping]

Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

a little louder.



Kill him!

Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

Oh, shit.



[parademons screeching]

The tower's down.

Do you read me?

Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

[over radio] <i>Are you okay?</i>

<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

Get to the reactor.

I'll lure as many
of these monsters

away from you as I can.
What does that mean?

Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

Luthor.

or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

[continues laughing]
[prison guard gasps]

[alarm wailing]

[prison guards
shouting indistinctly]

Ah, there he is.

Welcome aboard.

Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

I was just celebrating
God's return.

Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

a few clowns short of a circus.


until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

find some much needed clarity.

Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

free of charge.

Why the pro bono work?


Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

You said you had something
I'd want?

You'd better not be
wasting my time.

Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

No, I wouldn't think of it.

Uh, I have too much to live for.

And more important things to do.

But if you want the Batman,

here is something
that can help you.

His name is Bruce Wayne.

Hmm. On second thought,

we do have something
to celebrate.

Good boy.

[parademon chitters]

Clear.

How much further?

We're almost there.

Well, we need to hurry.

We can't be out in the open
much longer.

He'll come for us.


Let the bastard come.

I'll stab this through his heart

for what he did to Arthur.

I want to make him pay.

I understand how you feel, Mera.

You have no idea how I feel.

But we have to stick to the plan

to have any chance
to make this right.

[Mera scoffs]

Who have you ever loved?

[man cackling]

my little fish stick.

He knows exactly what it's like

to lose someone he loves.

You know, like, uh,

a father,

like a mother.

Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

Like an adopted son.

Isn't that right,

Batman?

Maybe, in a way,

that smelly
old flounder is right.

Because how many
can die in your arms

before you grow numb to death?

That's not very careful.

And how many dead eyes
can you look into

before you die inside yourself?

I've been dead inside
a long time,

but even I have a limit.

And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

You won't kill me.

I'm your best friend.

Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around? [chuckles]

Anyway,

you need me.

You

need me to help you
undo this world

you created by letting her die.

Poor Lois.

How she suffered so!


I often wonder

how many alternate timelines

do you destroy
the world because...

frankly, you don't have

the cojones to die yourself.

Hmm?

So, as usual,

I'll be the bigger man.

[blows air]

A truce,

Bruce.


As long as you
have this card, a truce.

But all you have to do

is tear it in half

and I'm happy
to discuss with you

in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

to do a man's job?

You know, it's funny

that you would talk about people

who died in my arms

because when I held Harley Quinn

and she was bleeding and dying,

she begged me
with her last breath

that when I killed you,

and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

that I'd do it slow.

I'm gonna honor that promise.

Oh. You're good.

You almost had me.


[Joker continues cackling]

Where are we holing up?

Somewhere he'll never suspect.

Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

[Joker blows raspberry]
What do you think?

[armor beeps]

[distant explosion]

He's found us.



[breathing heavily]

[distant explosions]

Can I help you?

I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

We have to find it
before he does.

There's a war coming.

And I'm here to help.

I'm sorry, who are you again?

I've gone by many names

and taken many forms.
And like you,

I've realized I have
a stake in this world

and it's time
I started fighting for it.

Oh.

Well, we could
definitely use the help.

So, glad you're here.

You know, I never thought

I'd see the defenders of Earth

united and fighting as one.

It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

Your mother and father
would be proud.

I hope so.

Well, I'll be in touch.

Oh, and some have called me

the Martian Manhunter.

I guess I'll see you around.

<i>â™ª I've heard there was
a secret chord â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That David played
and it pleased the lord â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But you don't really care
for music, do you? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The minor fall
The major lift â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The baffled king
composing hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well your faith was strong
but you needed proof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You saw her bathing
on the roof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her beauty and the moonlight
overthrew you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She tied you
to her kitchen chair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She broke your throne
and she cut your hair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And from your lips
she drew the hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey baby
I've been here before â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've seen this room
and I've walked this floor â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I used to live alone
before I knew you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I've seen your flag
on the marble arch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And love is not
a victory march â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's a cold and
it is a broken hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well there was a time
when you let me know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What's really going
on below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now you never show
that to me, do you? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Remember
when I moved in you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the holy ghost
was moving too â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And every breath
we drew was hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well, maybe there is
a god above â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But all I have
ever learned from love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Was how to shoot somebody â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who outdrew you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's not a cry
that you hear at night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it is not somebody
who's seen the light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's a cold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it is
a broken hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hallelujah â™ª</i>
