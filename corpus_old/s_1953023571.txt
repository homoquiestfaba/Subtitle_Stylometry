Two, two, one, two.
Mic check one, two. One, two.

Oh, yeah. rall know
what's coming up, don't you?

Come on, I got it right here.
I got it right here.

Bomont High School, where you at?

We got something to celebrate!
Bomont Panthers, 31!

Bayson Bulldogs, 17!
We killed 'em, y'all! Yeah!

All right, I want eveybody
on the dance floor! Come on!

What? What? rall ready to party?

Get up, get up! I thought
this was a party! Let's dance!

Been woking so hard

I'm punching my card

Eight hours for what?

Oh, tell me what I got

I've got this feeling

That time'sjust holding me down

I'll hit the ceiling

Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I got to cut loose

footloose
_ck off your Sunday shoes

Please, Louise

Pull me ofl of my knees

Jack, get back

Come on, before we crack

Lose your blues

Eveybody cut footloose

Hey, Robert!

Yeah!

Bomont High, where are you at now?

I'm not kidding.
They did not!

Yes, they did.
They did not.

We going to Mama's?

We're about to get real wild tonight,
y'all! Come on!

Ron, where we going tomorrow?
We're going to Mama Cannon's.

I'm sorry, guys.
Suzy gets the final call.

Turn it up, turn it up!
It's the best part!

Louder, Bobby!

Dispatch, stand by. I've got the
driver here. License and registration.

Step forward for me, please, sir.
All right.

He is testing us.

Our Lord is testing us.

Especially now...

...when we are consumed with despair.

When we are asking our God
why this had to happen.

No parent should ever have to
know the horror

of burying their own child.

And yet...

...five of Bomont's brightest
have lost their lives.

Among them, my only son.

My boy. Bobby.

We have other children
to raise here in Bomont.

And one day, they will
no longer be in our...

...embrace and in our care.

They will belong to the world.

A world filled
with evil and temptation...

...and danger.

But until that day,
they are ours to protect.

That is the lesson to be taken
from this tragedy. That is our test.

We cannot be missing
from our children's lives.

Momma, it's Ren! He's here!

I'm gonna beat you!

Hey, girls. How you doing?

You guys are huge!

Get off of me! Attack of the cousins!
Who'd you find, Amy?

Hey, darling.
Hey, how you doing?

Good. Hope you got some
sleep on that bus.

Yeah, I got plenty of sleep.
No worries, Lulu.

Hey, boy.
Wesley.

You used to call me Uncky Wes.

You too big in the britches
for that now?

Is anybody hungry?
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

Sounds good. Need a hand with that?
I got it, thanks.

Hey Ren, I wanna tell you a ioke.
How do you make a tissue dance?

Put a little boogie in it.

Hey, buddy, I tell you about
these baked beans?

Your great grandma Esther,
who you didn't know.

This is her secret recipe.

Yeah, you know what
the secret ingredient is?

Bourbon.

It's not bourbon. It's a ton of butter.

That's code for bourbon.
Now, we do burgers on Saturdays.

I didn't know if you were a vegetarian,
or a vegan or something?

No, no, no, this is great, it's good.
Thank you.

It's grass-fed beef.
Thank you.

With a bit of possum.

OK. Whose turn is it?
Daddy's!

Let's ioin hands. Bow your heads.

Most gracious heavenly Father,
we ask you to bless this food,

nourishment of our body and
greater strength for Thy good.

Help us be ever mindful
of the needs of others.

Amen!
Amen.

This used to be my office,
but Lulu fixed her up for you.

It's got all the essentials...
water, power, bed.

Look, I appreciate what you've
done here. Taking me in and all.

There, at the end, the money
you sent us... It really helped.

I wish I could have done more.

Now, look... there's rules in my house.

They're not written down,
they're just common sense.

Do your schoolwork. Don't stay out late,
that's not just my rule, that's the law.

And don't give people attitude.
This ain't Boston.

I really want to
pull my own weight around here...

Cooking meals, getting work,
helping out.

My buddy, Andy Beamis runs
a cotton gin up on Chulahoma.

He said you can start
in the middle of next week.

Couldn't I work at the car lot with you?

I'm good with engines, oil changes.
That's how I made money back home.

In this economy, that's the best I got.
I suggest you learn to love it.

Come on.

How am I supposed to
get to work and school?

You got subways out here in Mayberry?

There's that Yankee sarcasm
I've been hearing about.

Wish it were funnier. OK.

You say you're good with engines?
I'll make you a deal.

If you can get this baby running,
she's all yours.

This?
That's a bad-ass car, boy.

OK, OK. The door sticks.

And the gas pedal's missing.
A couple of the, uh...

Hey, it's a fixer-upper.

He did it! He did it!

Have a safe trip!

Oh, shit!

Step out of your vehicle, son.

Is there a problem, officer?
Driver's license.

Massachusetts, huh?

You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

You gonna throw me in iail
for playing Quiet Riot?

Let's watch that attitude, son.

Yankee sarcasm.
What was that?

Nothing. Sir.

You'll have to appear in court.
For what?

Disturbing the peace.

Peaceful out here, isn't it?

Progress.
What does progress mean to you?

We have computers in our pockets,

telephones in our automobiles,
and money on a plastic card.

Who here today remembers a time
when you had to go

inside the bank to get your money?

Remember old Mr. Rucker
down at Bomont State Bank?

Every time you made a deposit, he'd
give you a piece of Bazooka gum.

Now, I haven't yet met an ATM machine

that would give me a piece
of Bazooka chewing gum,

let alone make me feel special,
like Mr. Rucker did.

Now, is that progress?

Today...

...more and more, as families,
we are tuning each other out.

We're either su_ing on the Internet,

texting on our cell phones, or
staring mindlessly at a television set.

Now, if that is a portal to the world,
I want no part of it.

These are the people
that we need to tune in to.

Everyone in this church.

Thanks for coming today.
Nice preaching today, Reverend.

Good to see you.
Yes, sir, you, too.

This is my sister's son, the one I was
telling you about. Ren MacCormack.

Ren, Ren, welcome to Bomont.
How you doing?

We are so happy to have you with us.
Thank you.

I think you're gonna like
Bomont High School.

In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
the graduating class this year

is the biggest in the school's history.

Hey, Roger! Come on over here!

How many seniors
we have at Bomont High this year?

About 220, give or take a dropout.
Roger's the school principal there.

Hello.
Wait... Do you play football?

'Cause we really need a good kicker.
Ain't that a fact!

But, remember, if you're gonna play
for us, you gonna have to stay clean,

keep out of trouble. I heard you
already had a run-in with the law.

You what?

I don't know how it is up in Boston,
but down here we have rules

against playing music too loud.

You're kidding me.
He got popped for playing music?

Ariel! I want you to meet my daughter,
she goes to Bomont.

You're going to need a friend
on your first day.

This is Ren MacCormack. He'll be
attending school with you tomorrow.

Hey.
Hey.

Hey, Dad?
Yes, honey?

Rusty and I have that
science project due tomorrow,

we're going to be working on it pretty
late. I was thinking I'd stay over.

Is that OK?
On a school night? Is that necessary?

Rusty! Don't you think
it's gonna take us all night?

Sure. At least.

I guess it's fine, right...
Thanks, Daddy. Bye, Mom.

Come on, let's go.

And with _o laps to go,
the leader is car number_,

Chuck Cranston!

Coming around the last turn
on the final lap...

We have a winner!

In the number _ car,
it's Chuck Cranston

crossing the line first
for the checkered flag!

Let's hear it for Chuck!

Yeah! He iust won!

Yeah, baby!

Yeah, baby!

Today's late-model division
Two-time champion, folks.

Give it up for Chuck Cranston!
Way to go, Chuck!

Go up there, you get that flag and
get that cute ass out here right now!

Come on, now!

Hey, what are you doing?
Come back here with that!

Ariel, what the hell are you doing?!
Hammer down, baby!

Oh, yeah. Come on, now.

Chuck Cranston! I don't care if
your daddy does own this track,

you've got to get her out of here!

You can chase me down, old man.
Chase me down!

Get back here! You're going to
get yourself killed out there!

Once again, ladies and gentlemen, your
late-model division _o-time champion.

Let's give it up for Chuck Cranston!

Thanks for coming out to the
Cranston Motor Speedway.

Rusty!
We hope you had a good time.

Rusty, I'm talking to you!

You know when you're watching
the news, and you see someone

get killed doing something stupid?
God, this again?

I don't want to be that stupid friend
who just stands around watching.

He should never let you do that!
So you're just going to leave me?

Me?

Leave you?

I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

Ever since Bobby...

I guess I'll get my own ride back.
I guess you will.

Yellow flag.

Yellow flag.

Baby, why we got to go so fast?

You want some choirboy
to put a promise ring on your finger?

You're not gonna find that with me,
preacher's daughter.

Stop. I get that from everybody else.
I don't need that from you.

I thought it was real simple
with you and me.

Yeah?

I'm your man.

You're... you're my rebel child.

I'm not a child.

Prove it.

Shut the door.

Shut the door.

Go on.

Are you going to pout all day?

Look, I already said I was sorry.

It's Monday. Everybody gets a do-over.

You love me!
I know I do!

Isn't that that new kid
my mom introduced me to at church?

Sure is. He's cute.

You think everybody's cute.
I know, but I think he's cute.

He dressed up for his first day
of school. That's so cute!

Oh, my God, Rusty. Come on, let's go.

Did you see his tie?
I like it and I'm going to tell him.

That's a nice tie.
Rusty.

Hey, I mean it!
Don't let anyone tell you different.

Thanks, uh...

Rusty.
It's Ahriel, right?

It's Ariel.

Ariel.
Very good.

Hey. Watch where
you're going, little guy.

Sorry, man. I didn't see you.
It's like driving.

Stick with the
flow of traffic, numbnuts.

Maybe if you weren't wearing
all that camouflage, I could see you.

You should get one of them orange
vests so hunters don't shoot you.

An orange vest? I don't wear orange.

I'm not a Tennessee fan.
I'm a Georgia Bulldog.

Where you from? You talk funny.

I talk funny? I talk funny?
You should hear you from my end.

I'm from Boston.

Massachusetts?

It's in the United States?
Yeah, I read that somewhere.

What's up, man? I'm Willard.

I'm Ren. MacCormack.
Nice to meet you. Let me see this.

Literature and Composition.
That's this way. Follow me.

People give you shit
about that tie yet?

Nah, but the day iust started.
First group, on your mark...

Keep that head down! Head down!

I'm gonna smoke your butt, man.

You think so?
I know so. Your butt's getting smoked.

Come on, Willard!

Go get your water.

Don't gulp it down!

Warm it up in your mouth.

Two swallows, hit them monkey bars.

You're looking flushed, Willard.
My cheeks are naturally ruddy, man.

Ren, this is Woody, our team captain.
You don't gotta salute him.

What's up, man? Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

Last year, varsity made it to regional.
They bussed us down to Alabama.

The excitement never stops.

You haven't been overseas?
I've been to Alabama, if that counts.

No. It doesn't.

I went to Russia two years ago
with my gymnastics team.

It's kind of a sister city
thing with Moscow.

Yeah, Russia... I don't know if I
dig that. It sounds kind of boring.

Do you know anything
about Russian girls?

I know they range from
bearded to drop-dead beautiful.

Yeah? Well, I can vouch
for the beautiful ones.

Two girls from the Russian team

snuck me out of my dorm room
late night. They didn't have beards.

They were smoking.
What were they smoking?

Oh, you mean, like, smokin' hot.
I'm sorry. Continue.

So we go to this club.
The music's banging. It's pitch black.

I couldn't see shit, iust hot two girls
drenched in sweat all over me.

We danced all night.
Great. What'd you guys do after?

Oh, come on. Look, down in the South,
you can't start a story

about a threesome and not finish it.

Come on.

It goes without saying,
these girls are flexible.

They take me into a bathroom stall.
One shoves her tongue down my throat,

the other one's on top. This girl's
a champion pommel horse gymnast.

I'm talking killer
upper body strength. Banging.

She's scratching my back,
she's tearing my clothes off.

And her friend's whispering
in my ear, "Hernnya. "

Her...
Hernnya.

Hernnya.
Yeah.

What does that mean?
It's Russian for "bullshit. "

Why would she say that?

'Cause you're bullshitting me?
Yup. Yeah.

But we did dance, man.

We danced our asses off.

That ain't right.

You ever work at a gin before?
You know about a bale press?

I don't know. I've never seen one.

Where are you from?
Boston, Mass.

Did they teach you
anything useful up north?

Just enough to get by. I'm hoping y'all
can teach me the three R's.

Three R's?

Yeah, you know...
reading, writing, redneckery.

People are giving you
a hard time, I can see that.

You're young, you're from out of town
and you're a smart aleck.

Can you start Thursday?

Yeah. Yes, sir!

I'll teach you to read and write,

but you're on your own
when it comes to redneckery.

Yeah. Give it a little bit of gas.

Yeah, that sounds good. Cut it.

What's the deal with the preacher's
daughter? She worth all that attitude?

I hear, back in the day,
she used to be a goody two-shoes.

Now she fronts like she some hellraiser.
Wearing her jeans tight and everything.

You could put a quarter
in that girl's back pocket

and tell if it's heads or tails.

Why? You're trying to knock boots
with her, aren't you?

No.
Yes, you are. He is.

I'm iust curious. I ain't trying to
bang her or take her ballroom dancing.

Well, that'd be pretty hard,
being that that's against the law.

What? Banging a preacher's daughter?

No, public dancing's against the law
if you're under 18.

Shut up.

Wait, wait, wait. Jump back.

Are you kidding me?
Dancing is against the law?

Yeah, man. We got laws
up the poop chute around here.

I can't even bring a bandana to school,
because they think I'm in a gang.

If my face gets sweaty,
I gotta use the back of my hand.

Let me tell you something,
this country was built on bandanas.

So you're telling me Bomont High
doesn't have a prom.

Well, you know...
They got the Fall Ball, right?

OK. So, all the churches
get together and put it on.

The whole town shows up
and everybody's eyes are on you

to make sure you're dancing
at least six inches away from your girl.

You gotta add
another two inches for me.

And, for one song, they make you...
They make you dance with your mother.

I mean, talk about a boner killer.

And the schools don't wanna
have dances on their property.

They... They say they
don't want to be held liable.

They don't want to be held
liable for what?

Five seniors died in a car crash
coming home from a dance,

and that's when
the whole town went crazy.

They started blaming it on the liquor,
the music, the dancing.

After a while everybody
started thinking dancing was a sin.

But we're talking about the law, right?
Not heaven and hell?

Yeah, take that up with Reverend Moore.
I'm a machine, I'm a machine.

Hey, what's up, dude?

Hey, Woody, what's up, man?

Hey, how you doing?

MacCormack.
How you doing, buddy?

Good, man. You hungry?
Yeah. What's good here?

We got nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers.

Frito pie, all the way.

And if you're a real man?
You'll eat that jalapeño.

Get your fingers out of my pie!
What about that guy?

You don't know where his finger's been.

Woody! Check the door, man.
Cop still here?

Five-O getting his move on.

What you got for me, Uncle Claude?
David Banner.

Bootleg. Don't get too krunk out there.

First sign of the police,
I'm gonna pull the plug.

I don't wanna get a fine,
and you don't wanna get another ticket.

Wait. You got a ticket for dancing?
He got two tickets for dancing.

One more and he's off the team.

All right. Let's get
this party started! It's on!

No cops. Let's get it, come on!
Let's get it started!

Yo! It's shomime!

It's clear!
Let's go!

Back it up, back it up, move out.

Whoa.

Woody!
Woody!

Whoa!

Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's a beautiful thing!

Does that turn you on?
Girls acting like hussies?

It don't suck.

Oh, now, come on.

Yeah, dude. They... they get into it.

Hey, you. Let's go.

Come on, let's dance.

Come on!
I'm good. I don't dance.

You go have fun.

Me and my boys are going
to push everybody back.

Let me see you do that city boy thing.

C'mon! Get it!

Oh, dang. Oh, dang.

Claude!
Reverend Moore's out front, man.

Oh, shit.

You want me to step in on this?

What, you can't keep up?

You can put on a show for that guy.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna.

Attention, attention. Ar9el Moore,

will you please come up
to the front of the diner.

Your daddy is here for you.

She's busted!

Show's over.

You mother was afraid you didn't
have any money. She said you'd be here.

Daddy, it's not a big deal.
We were just messing around.

I think it would be best
if you came home with me.

Right now.

Daddy gonna
take her out to the woodshed.

What the hell does that mean?

It means she's in deep shit.

Hey, honey. You're home early.
Yeah.

Did you have fun?

Just breaking the law, Momma.
Ariel. We have not finished talking.

Ariel!

Why do you think you're above serving
your penalty in Saturday School?

I don't think I'm above anyone, sir.
I was just unaware that...

Hey, Eddie? Eddie?

He has a iob on Saturdays
over at Andy's cotton gin.

Wes. Call me "Judge," would you?

And take your hat off.
OK, Judge Eddie.

Could you show a little mercy here?
He was playing his music too loud.

About as loud as you used to
play Lynyrd Skynyrd

in that old Impala
me and you used to roll in.

Remember that... Judge?

You'll have Andy verify his employment?

Now hold on...
Yes I will!

Can I go back to the car lot now?
Sentence suspended.

Oh, man. Son, you're lucky.

Not everyone's got this town
on lockdown like I do.

Oh, yeah? Since you and the iudge
are so buddy-buddy,

maybe you can have him explain this
whole ban-on-dance thing to me.

Whatever happened to separation
of church and state?

What's church got to do with it?

It seems to have everything
to do with everything around here.

Let me ask you a question.

If there's a football game Sunday
and you want to buy a beer, can you?

You can't buy beer on Sundays.
And why not?

'Cause of church.

You can in Boston, why not in Bomont?

Look. Sunday is God's day.

If you want to drink beer on God's day,
you need to buy it on beer's day,

which is Saturday.

It's right there in the Bible,
if you don't believe me.

Separation of God and beer.

And if God said it, I believe it.
That settles it! Now shut up.

Hey, MacCormack.

Hey, what's up... Ariel?

Chuck Cranston wants to see you
at his daddy's racetrack tomorrow.

Be there at two o'clock.
OK. What happens at two o'clock?

Show up and find out.
And what if I don't?

You're gonna miss all the fun.
How come he sent you to tell me?

I volunteered.

If that shithog tries anything,
I'm gonna pound him.

No fighting, Willard.
No promises, Rusty.

You guys, keep the smoke away
from her now. Her daddy smells that,

he'll never let her hang out again.
High school field trip's here.

Twinkle toes.

Watching you the other night,
that was real entertaining.

We thought we'd invite you out here.
Maybe you could put on a show for us.

Chuck, didn't you hear?
He's real into gymnastics.

Gymnastics.

Well... I thought only fags
were into gymnastics.

I thought only assholes
still used the word "fag. "

Touché.

Why don't you...

...try dancing with this?

Now... we race these buses
every weekend at the Derby Mash-up.

We race them in a figure eight,
just like this.

Two things you gotta worry about.
Your corners, and your intersection.

You fall behind, you're gonna
get hit by the leader.

You pull ahead, you iust might
get slammed by the guy in last place.

What do you say, city boy?
Ready to race?

I drove one of these at a pep rally
one time... it ain't easy.

All right? If she flips over,
crawl out the side window.

If it catches on fire, iump out of it.

Keep loose.
Pump your brakes with your foot.

Pump the brakes. Tell him.

I iust told him.
Cool. Pump them brakes.

All right, man. Good luck.
Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys.

This is pretty dangerous, right?
We could get killed?

We? What's this "we," white boy? Crazy.
We? Like I'd get my black ass up there.

What'd I get myself into?

How do, all you pissants? Welcome
to the Cranston Motor Speedway!

Whoa, baby! You OK?
You kinda had a lot to smoke.

Don't be tellin' me
when I've had enough.

Looks like a lovely day for a bus...

I didn't say you had enough.
I just said you had a lot.

If you want to lecture somebody,
go tell Sweet Buns to start his engine.

We got one practice lap
before the green flag drops, folks.

It's a three-lap race to the
finish line, or the last man standing.

Gentlemen, start your engines!

Let's go!

We've got homegrown hero
Chuck Cranston in Burn in Hell.

You're in my world now, boy!

On the outside, we've got the new kid

racing in the Fun Zone,
Ren MacCormack.

Go, Fun Zone!

Caroline and Russell
are in the back of the pack, y'all.

Hey! Where's the green flag?

Improvise.
Now we're coming into turn four,

getting ready for the green flag.
Oh, yeah!

Preacher's daughter, my ass, baby!

Green flag, green flag,
green flag! And... Go!

Come on, Ren! Go!

Go, Ren! C'mon!
Let's go!

They're coming around turn number one.
Fun Zone is loose around the corner.

Hang in there! Hang in there!

Chuck Cranston takes the lead,
with Russell on his ass.

Caroline and MacCormack are door to
door, they're battling for third place!

You want a little smooch?

She is tearing him up!

Coming out of turn four.

Here they come,
headed straight for the intersection!

Pump the brakes!
Somebody better stop.

Somebody better do something!

Watch out, baby!
Shit!

Caroline is into the wall!
Sorry, girl.

Russell! You damn son of a bitch!

Russell and MacCormack
are duking it out for second place.

Shit!

We got fireworks! God bless America!

And I'm on fire.

Chuck Cranston holds the lead
with one lap to go!

Getting lonely up here!

Oh, we've got us a regular
Mexican standoff, folks.

Don't you play chicken with me, boy.

Who's gonna back down?
Who's gonna back down?

Somebody's got to back down.

Oh, what the hell.
No, no, no! Damn it!

Chuck is down!
MacCormack takes the lead!

Yeah!

Fire! He's on fire!

Damn it!

I got no brakes!
Run! Hurry!

We're coming for you, Ren! Hold on!

Oh, my God!

Hey man, did you know
your bus is on fire?

Yeah, no shit!
Stop this bus!

Pump the brakes!
The gas pedal is stuck!

Do something!
Abandon bus!

Abandon bus!
We need to get off this bus!

Ren, you gotta get off, man!

The wheels on the bus go
boom, boom, boom!

Yes, sir! Get some! Fire it up!

You OK, baby?
Oh, my God!

Get some!

That was awesome!
Let's do that again! Yes!

Hey, man. Chuck's pretty sore
about losing that race.

I mean, you blew up
the man's bus, dude.

Yeah... Bomont blows, dude.

I don't have to tell you, though, do I?

Yeah. I've been to Chicago. St. Louis.

Been up to some of them clubs
in New York City. I been around.

Just like you, man.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

Hey.

You get high?
'Cause I do... every damn day.

If you want, you and I
can go burn one right after school.

You know, city mouse, country mouse...

Blazing!

What makes you think
I'm anything like you?

Hold on a second.

This is what we call a take-homer.
You need anything else?

I don't want this.
It's cool. It's cool.

No, it's not cool. Take this...

We can go down to the
railroad tracks and chief one now.

No, seriously, take this.
Hey!

What is that?
What's what?

In your hand. Let me see it.

Young man. Hey!

Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

Hey! Stop!

Open the door!

Open!

I will not tolerate it, Ren.
Not in my school.

So what have you gotta say for yourself?

What do I have to say? I was on
the gymnastics team for three years.

Got drug tested all the time.
If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.

He had a ioint...
You know what one looks like?

Were you going to smoke it or sell it?

Mr. Parker says you were with
Rich Sawyer when this went down.

I don't even know that prick.
Hey! Language.

Ren, level with me.

Was it Rich's ioint? You can tell me.

I don't do drugs.

You can test me.
And when it comes out clean,

I want this guy investigated for
barging into the bathroom stall with me.

That's gross.

Well. Since we don't have the evidence,

I'm going to let you off
with a warning this time.

But Ren, listen to me,
you have to understand something.

You see, life is not some big party.

I don't care what the rap music
people say, marijuana is just wrong.

Son, listen to me.

Ren, I knew your momma.

That's right. I knew Sandy.

She had a wild spark, iust like you.

Running off up north, trying to live
the high life might have been fun,

but it also led her into getting
into some kind of...

... unexpected trouble.
Unexpected trouble.

I'm thinking when you say "unexpected
trouble," you're talking about me.

Right? Right?

Look, believe me, don't believe me.
Suspend me, arrest me. I don't care.

But you do me one favor, all right?

Never talk to me about my mother again.
You understand?

Hey!

Let him go.

Hey, MacCormack.

What's the rush?

Dude, you trying to
ignore me or something?

I'm doing the best that I can!

Massachusetts, huh?

You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

"You got that music
cranked pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack. "

Yeah! No shit, Barney Fife!

Watch that attitude, son.

Try being a cop in Boston,
you huckleberry!

I will not tolerate it, Ren.
Shut up! I'm talking!

Not in my school.

Mr. Dunbar.
Mr. Douchebag! Mr. Dumb-Ass.

With your righteousness
and your little vest.

Stop trying to act like you know me!

Don't act like you know me. Don't try
and act like you know my mother!

You don't know the pain
she went through every day.

You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

Well, I thought I was alone.
Not in this town, you're not.

There are eyes everywhere.

So what was all that?
What was all what?

All that.

I was iust letting off some steam,
I'm sure you got your own wicked ways.

You think I'm a slut or something?

I think you've been kissed a lot.

Where's lugnut?
You mean Chuck?

He doesn't own me. I know
he acts like he does, but he doesn't.

You want to see something?

Everybody calls it the yearbook.

I don't know when it started,
maybe 10 years ago or so.

What is all this?
Some are songs. Lyrics.

Quotes from books.

Poems. Music we're not
supposed to listen to.

What do people do? Just hang out?
Yeah.
