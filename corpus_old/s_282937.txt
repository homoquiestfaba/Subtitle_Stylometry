Chaos

Here you are, sir.

Shall I?

Yes.

There.

Thanks.

We should`ve had Chinese.

Chopsticks are worse.

You’re right.

Your signature.

It was delicious.

Thank you.

Thanks.

They’re all waiting.

Thanks.

Did my wife call?

No. I thought she was dining with you.

She was...

That’s fine, then.

Yes.

You have a call from
the Meiwa Bank. A Mr. Sato.

Meiwa Bank? Put him through.

Right away.

Komiyama speaking.

I’ve got your wife.

What?

Komiyama Saori.
Your wife, right?

Oh, I see.

I’m said, I’ve kidnapped her.

Is this a joke?

How was your lunch at "L"?

Who... just who are you?

Are you Iistening? I’m the man
that kidnapped your wife.

Saori, where’s Saori?

With me.

Put her on.

Impossible.

Why?

We just finished fucking.
She’s out of breath.

How dare you!

She’s some broad.
Your wife.

Put her on!

Ooooh, tough! Hold on.

Your hubby.

Hello.

Saori?

Darling.

You’re not hurt, you’re OK?

Yes.

Where are you?

I don’t know.

No personal questions now.

She’d better be OK.

You heard her.

Don’t touch her.

Don’t you worry.
She’s precious merchandise.

She’s got Fragile stickers all over.

What was that?

Nothing.

What did you do?

Nothing.

I heard her.

Enough. I’ll hang up.

Wait. I understand.
How much do you want?


Thirty million.

Thirty million...

For starters, thirty million yen, cash.
Noon tomorrow.

I’ll call your house with instructions.

Ready?

Yes.

This is Location 1. We’re ready.

We’re connected.

The last time you saw your wife
was at the Restaurant "L"?

Yes. She went out while I was paying.

I thought she’d wait, but
when I got out, she was gone.

How long was that?

Two, three minutes.

Do you remember seeing any
suspicious-looking men or vehicles?

No.


And the perp asked you
about your meal at "L"?

Yes.

Did you look for her?

No.

I see...

I was late for a meeting.

I see.

Do you think that’s when he got her?

It’s too soon to tell, but probably so.

It’s my fault.

If only I’d looked for her then...

My office.

Hello.

It can wait.

Excuse me. It’s from Mr. Sato at
Meiwa Bank, about yesterday’s loan.

He’s left an urgent message.

Sato from Meiwa!

Yes. Are you ready?

Go ahead.

Dial #85O1,

Followed by 3221-3757.

Punch in his personal code 1102.

Repeat that.

May I?

Yes.

After dialing #8501, you dial322...

Got it. Thanks.

Location 1 calling. Any luck?

OK. Roger on that.

No luck tracing it.


It’s blocked.

A voice mail system.

Yeah. Impossible to trace.

The phone company?

Not now.

Please make the call...

OK.

The number matches
your number here.

This is the Voice Mailbox...

And the code?

11O2. That’s Saori`s birthday!

November second.

Enter your mailbox number
and press the pound sign.

You have one new message.

Put the thirty million in shopping
bag and seal it with tape.

Take it and get in a taxi.

Go to the Hanyu rest area
on the Northeast Expressway.

You have until 2PM.
If you don’t show up, the deal`s off.

If a cop drives the taxi, or I see
anything suspicious, it’s all off.

Can we make it?

I think so.

How will he find me at the rest area?

Mr. Komiyama.

Yes.

The perp might be watching now.
Try not to talk to me.

Saori will die.

He didn’t follow the rules.

Don’t tell the cops.
Otherwise they both die.

This is the Kuriharas`.

I`m killing your sister.

Who is this?

Your brother’s wife.
You know she’s been kidnapped.

Oh...

Your brother broke the rules.

So she dies.

Wait, just wait.

If you want her alive, bring all the
money in the house to Asagaya station.

I`ll meet you at platform 2.

If you’re not there by 2,
I’ll kill Saori.

But I don’t have...

You bringing it or not!

Yes.

You Saeko?

What?

You know, I don’t just have Saori.

I`ve got your son, too.

What!

Listen up. Don’t you dare tell the cops.
Or your brother.

Talk, and they’re both dead.

Yes. I understand.

Welcome.
Please deposit your parking fee.

Thank you.

This is Ebara AII-Serve.
I can’t take your call right now.


Please leave your name and number
after the tone and I`ll call you back.

Hello, this is Tashiro Minoru.

I’ve been visiting my son and his wife.

I need a "Go" partner.

How about a game of Go?

My number is 3752-4460.

I hope you`ll return my call.

Yes?

Who are you?

I’m Komiyama.

What happened?

I disguised myself, by wearing
clothes I’d never choose.

Disguise?

Yes.

Why on earth?

I just had lunch with my husband.

And?

At a French restaurant called "L".

May l?

Yes...

I left while he was settling the bill.
Of course no one saw me.

I was wearing these.

You look like a kid.

My husband will fall for it.

Aren’t we bossy.

Here.

What `s that?

A million.

That`ll cover it right?

The kidnapping.

Thanks.

Don’t worry. I washed it.

Oh, thanks.

What is it?

It’s just that um...
I hadn’t noticed yesterday,

but haven’t we met before?

No, l don’t think so.

l see...

I certainly don’t dress this way.

Right. Sorry.

Not at all.

I figured out a place to
hide while I’m kidnapped.

What?

My college friend, Soma Rumi,
happens to be in America now.

She asked me to feed her tropical fish,
so l have her keys.

You think of everything.

That bother you?

No. Does your husband know?

I didn’t tell him.

When does she return?

Next Monday.

I see.

What do you say?

You’re serious.

I told you l was.

Yes. Sorry.

And once you’re free.

What?

When you’re kidnapped,
your husband will call the police.

if not at first,

then definitely after you get home.

We need a dose of reality
to make it convincing.

Reality?

Yes. Besides, l don’t want to get
caught by the cops either.

Which apartment?

303.

You go ahead.
Make sure no one sees you go in.

And you, Handyman?

I got stuff to do.

OK.

l`ll make the first call now.

Yes.

Let’s go over a few details.

Yes.

Komiyama Saori was abducted near
"L" and confined somewhere.

Always remember that premise.

Yes.

That where, is of course not here.

Meaning you leave no evidence
of having been here.

Yes.

First, don’t go touching anything.


Yes.

Second, keep
the curtains shut, like this.

Yes.

When you need a light, use this.

Yes.

And obviously, don’t answer
the phone or the door.

Of course you stay inside.
Keep it locked up.

Yes.

And no feeding those fish either.

What?

Listen. You’ve been kidnapped.

How can you feed the fish?

But they’ll die, then.

Who matters more, you or the fish?

I understand.

Next, the Hostage Life, 101.


101?

First, no baths. Or showers.

No showers?

Of course not.

Not even my face?

Listen, lady. If you want the story
to fly, you need actions, not just words.

I`m sorry.

Also, only eat the food l brought.

Don’t touch any of her food.

I understand.

it’ll be rough, but that’s the deal.

Yes.

And there’s one more thing.

While you were being held,
your hands and feet were tied.

Yes.

You have to tie me?

It’ll be more realistic if your
hands and feet are bruised.

Put on the others.

Yes.

I’m ready.

I’ll get rid of these clothes.
All right?

Yes.

I’ll tie you up now.

You’ve got to bear it.

Yes.

You see how l did it?

I guess.

Undo it to go to the bathroom,
but tie yourself back up again.

I understand.

Your wrists, too.

It doesn’t have to be so tight.
You want to be able to untie it.

Yes.

Try it.

Pull this through here.

And tie it like this.

Yes.

Pull it with your teeth.

What are you doing?

You’re defenseless, aren’t you, lady?

What?

I always wanted to fuck someone tied up.

We’re not playing anymore.

Get it?

Please... don’t...

This is Shinko Enterprises.

Hello. This is Sato from Meiwa Bank.
We always appreciate your business.

Is the president in?

Please hold.

Now this is what you call reality, lady.

I’ll call when l get back.

But I can’t answer the phone.

I’ll ring 3 times, hang up, then
3 times again. You unlock the door.

I’ll  call when I’m close.

Three rings, and then
another three rings.

Lady.

A mistake to answer the phone.

Who is this?

Who cares.

You? You did this?

It’s your fault, Mr. Kidnapper.

Why’d you do it?

It just happened.

That’s no reason.

Look who’s talking.
You snatched her liberty.

No. She asked me to stage a kidnapping.
That’s all.

You tied her up
to stage a kidnapping?

It’s the truth.
She asked me to kidnap her.

Huh. I wonder if the cops will buy that.

I need a favor.

What?

Dump her for me.

What?

I don’t like loose ends.

Do it yourself.

Don’t want to get caught.

Enough of your crap. Forget it.

Oh, well. Then l have no choice.

Meaning?

I’ll call the cops right now. Tell them
I heard a woman screaming in 303.

What’s wrong?

OK. I’ll do it.

Thanks.

What?

Take care of it.

Noboru.

Daddy.

What’s wrong?

What happened?

Had a fight?

OK. C’mon inside.

This is Ebara AII-serve.

I can’t take your call right now.

Please leave your name

and number after the tone
and I’ll call you back.

Hello, it’s Misako...

Hi, it’s me.

What, you’re home.
Say, is Noboru with you?

Yeah he is.

Why can’t you call!

What?

I didn’t know where he’d gone,

and was about to call the police.

Sorry.

Why are you always like this?
Can’t you think about others?

Noboru came by himself.

But you could still call!

Sorry.

I’ll come get him.

No, I’ll bring him.

Leave now.

OK.

Wait here, Noboru.

Where you going?

Where you going`!

Move your car!

Let go!

Wait up! Asshole!

Kept you waiting.

You look tired.

No.

Why don’t you take a little
time off from work?

That’s not really possible.
Besides, I’d rather be working.

I see.

Please.
