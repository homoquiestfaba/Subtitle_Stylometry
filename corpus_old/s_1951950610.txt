By the '70s, the big bang theory
Was already well established.

So they tried to come up With alternative
scenarios for the universe's evolution,

like, what if you mess around With gravity
or strength of the electromagnetic force?

hat do you think that Will do
to the universe's evolution?

Nothing.
rong, dumbass.

Even the slightest tinkering
derails the Whole process.

You're Just focusing on what you Want to.

There's Just as much evidence
for a random universe,

that life is completely insane and chaotic.

hat are you talking about, man?

Even the most seemingly random events
have logic behind them.

As far as my life goes,
l know exactly what l'm doing.

Geniuses don't make mistakes.

They instigate their own problems

so they can be worked out
for deeper insight.

Chaos is harder to embrace.

lt's scary to think there's no one out there
looking out for us.

Just smoke, man.

Hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on

(monitor beeping)

Hold on, hold on

Hold on...

Hey.
Hey.
