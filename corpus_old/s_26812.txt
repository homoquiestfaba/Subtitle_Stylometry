A terrorist arms bazaar
on the Russian border.

Our man's in position.

It's like
a terrorist supermarket.

Chinese Longmark SCUD,
Panther attack helicopter,

Russian mortars
and American rifles.

Chilean mines,
German explosives.

Fun for the whole family.

IDs.

White Knight,
show us the pawns.

Start with that chap
in the middle.

Database ID Search.

We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isigura.

Wanted for
the Tokyo subway attack.

Currently working for the
insurgent force in Zaire.

Henry Gupta. American.

Practically invented
techno-terrorism.

Started out as a student
radical in the Sixties.

Now works for cash.
Zoom in there.

An American encoder.

They use it to control
navigation satellites.

Will the CIA be more upset

that they lost it
or we found it?

Excuse me, Admiral?

We've seen enough, M.

This is now
a military operation.

Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

We have election
in Moscow next week.

The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

We'll take the naval option.

One strike takes out
half the world's terrorists.

I must protest.

Get me the Chester.
Let's not waste time.

My man isn't finished.
Authorisation to fire.

Get your man out of there.
His job's over.

Prepare to fire.

On my count.

5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Missile away.

Time to target.
4 minutes, 8 seconds.

White Knight,
4 minutes to impact.

It's on the screen
in front of me.

It's a jeep in front of a plane.

Now get out of there.

What's going on?
You will not wait!

What is your man
waiting for?

White Knight... Oh, my God!

Soviet nuclear torpedoes!
If the Cruise hits them...

Abort the missile.

H.M.S. Chester. Urgent.

Abort missile. Abort missile.

Abort missile.
Abort missile.

Captain, missile out of range.

Unable to destroy.

Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

Will it trigger the torpedoes?
It might.

There is enough plutonium

to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

Get him out now!

White Knight, come in.
Keep trying!

Filthy habit.

I got the encoder!

What's he doing?
His job.

He's going for the bombs.

Get that jeep.

Get out, James.

One minute till impact.

30 seconds.

Backseat driver.

White Knight to White Rook.

Ask the admiral where he'd like
his bombs delivered.

Sound the alarm.

The ship has been
overflown by two Chinese MiGs.

We believe
they have hostile intent.

Advance to action stations.

This is your last warning.

This is your last warning.

You are in Chinese
territorial waters.

Maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

Revolution, 1-6-0.
Are they insane?

Sir, the Chinese pilot
insists he will fire

if we don't turn round.

Send this.

"We are in international waters

and will defend ourselves
if attacked."

Are we absolutely
sure of our position?

Yes, sir.
An exact satellite fix.

Carver Media Group Network
Tamburg

Carver Media Group Network
Tamburg

Captain,
we are ready to launch.

Shut down the engines.

The sea drill isn't
invisible to radar.

We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by.

The British will think
it's a Chinese torpedo.

I'll report in.

Stamper to Hamburg.
Phase one is in progress.

I'll report back to you
with an update.

The MiGs are passing again.
Let's start the show.

Start the drill.

Release it.
Sea drill away.

Green 3-0. Torpedo!
Torpedo!

8-1-6 CCMs!

Hard right, 1-4-1.

There's no sonar contact.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

It's gonna hit!
Brace, brace, brace!

Target 1200.
Knock knock.

Go upstairs.

Turn left.
Rotating 90 degrees.

They're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

Full damage report!

Sonar's off-line.
Backup power!

Switch to alternate supply.
Three generators down, sir.

Flooding on foredeck aft.
Starboard down 14 degrees.

Yeoman, send to Admiralty .

"Torpedoed by Chinese MiGs.
Sinking."

Give them our position.

Right. Abandon ship.

Out! Out!
Abandon ship!

One missile at the MiGs.

Maintain radio silence.

Their last broadcast, sir.

Mr Gupta's encoder worked.

They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

The British navy
will never find them.

Survivors in the water.

< Mr Stamper.

I'm having fun
with my headlines.

I need the exact number
of survivors.

Make sure you use
the right ammunition.

Yes, sir.

Delicious.

Start the recovery operation.

Send our divers down.

Mr Gupta, phase one is complete.

Good morning,
my golden retrievers.

Good morning,
my golden retrievers.

What havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create today? News?

Floods in Pakistan,
riots in Paris,

a plane crash in California.
Excellent.

Mr Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?

Yes, sir. As requested,
it's full of bugs,

so people will be forced
to upgrade for years.

Outstanding.

Mr Wallace, call the president.

Tell him if he doesn't
lower the cable rates,

we'll release the video
of him with a cheerleader.

Inspired, sir.

Then release the tape anyway.

Consider him slimed.

Excuse me.

He's on transponder 7.
Mr Stamper?

Phase 2 is underway.

I have the videotape.

I haven't seen it,
but I'm told it's excellent.

There were 17 survivors
for your headlines.

Good work, Stamper.

Thank you.
Don't mention it.

Keep it in a safe place.

Gentlemen and ladies,
hold the presses.

This just in.

By a curious quirk of fate,

we have the perfect story

with which to launch our
satellite news network tonight.

A small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.

I want full newspaper coverage.

I want magazine stories,
books, films, TV, radio!

I want us on air 24 hours a day!

This is our moment!

And a billion people
around this planet

will watch it, hear it
and read about it

from the Carver Media Group.

There's no news...
like bad news.

 am pleased
with your progress, Mr Bond.

I've always enjoyed studying
a new tongue, Professor.

One might say
you have a natural ability.

But practice makes perfect.

Hmm. Who's that?

How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

Ignore it.

Words they don't have
in their vocabulary.

Bond here.

Go to a secure line, 007.

Going to scrambler,
channel...4.

It was in international waters.

We can't be certain.

James, where are you?

Oh, Moneypenny.
Um...I'm just up here at Oxford,

brushing up on a little Danish.

Little?

You'll have to kiss off
your lesson, James.

We've got a situation here.

We're sending
the fleet to China.

Uh-huh.
I'll be there in, uh...

in an hour.

30 minutes.

Goodbye, my sweet.

You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

Don't ask.
Don't tell.

We know exactly
where that ship was!

The Global Positioning
Satellites do not lie!

Our Singapore station picked up
a mysterious GPS signal.

It could have sent
that ship off course.

I have a missing frigate...
I'm aware of that!

All you want to do...
Is prevent World War III !

I don't think sending an armada
is the way to do it.

Where did this signal come from?

We're still investigating.
Investigating!

M, sometimes I don't think you
have the balls for this job.

At least I don't have
to think with them all the time.

That's enough.
Where do we stand?

It was an unprovoked attack on
a ship in international waters.

We send in the fleet and prepare
for full retaliation.

Moderation.

We investigate rather than send
the entire British navy

within 10 minutes of
the world's largest air force.

When will our ships get there?
48 hours, sir.

Christ! The press are
already screaming for blood.

We don't want
to escalate the situation.

I'm afraid it may be too late.

"17 British Sailors Murdered"?

According to
Vietnamese officials,

the victims were riddled
with ammunition

used by the Chinese air force.

Did you leak this?
No!

It's the first I've heard of it.

Well, this settles it.
We send in the fleet.

M, you have 48 hours
to investigate.

There is one strange thing.

The Vietnamese only found
our sailors three hours ago.

How'd they get the paper
out so fast?

"Tomorrow" knew before
the Vietnamese government did.

How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

World-wide media baron,
able to topple governments.

Carver owns that newspaper
"Tomorrow".

That mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

The PM would have my head

if he knew you were
investigating him.

I'm sending you to Hamburg.

There's a party tonight
at Carver's media centre.

They've launched
a new satellite.

He can now reach
every human being on earth.

Except the Chinese,
who've refused broadcast rights.

James, your ticket, cover story
and car reservation.

Sign here, please.

You had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

That was a long time ago, M,
before she married.

I didn't realise
it was public knowledge.

Queen and country , James.

Find out whether Carver sent
that ship off-course and why.

Use your relationship
with Mrs Carver.

I doubt if she'll remember me.
Remind her.

Then pump her for information.

You just have to decide how much
pumping is needed, James.

If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

Passengers are asked
not to leave baggage unattended.

If you just sign here, Mr Bond.

It's the insurance damage waiver

for your beautiful new car.

Will you need
collision coverage?

Yes.

Fire?

Probably.

Property destruction?
Definitely.

Personal injury?

I hope not,
but accidents happen.

They frequently do with you.

Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

Do I need any other protection?

Only from me, 007,

unless you bring that car back
in pristine order.

Shall we?
Shall we?

Your new BMW 750.

All the usual refinements -

machine guns, rockets
and a GPS tracking system.

Welcome.

Please fasten seat belt
and obey all instructions.

Thought you'd pay
more attention to a female.

I think we've met.

I am not interested
in your sordid escapades.

Your new telephone.

Talk here, listen here.

So that's what
I've been doing wrong.

Look.

It also includes
a fingerprint scanner

and a 20,000-volt
security system

And this I'm
particularly proud of -

the remote control
for your car.

Tap twice. 1, 2.

Draw your finger very slowly

across the pad

to drive the car.

It's difficult to drive,
but with practice...

Let's see how she responds
to my touch.

Think we understand
each other.

Grow up, 007.

Engine running.
Please shut door.

Engine running.
Please shut door.

Don't let her push you around.

There's absolutely no truth

in this malicious rumour

that I ran
Mad Cow disease stories

simply because Angus Black,
the British beef baron,

lost £10,000 to me at poker
and refused to pay.

Nor did I take 100 million
francs from the French

to keep the stories running.

Excuse me, Mr Carver.
Yes?

This is the new banker, Mr...

Bond. James Bond.

I seem to collect bankers.

Mr Bond, how is the market
reacting to the crisis?

Currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

I don't believe we've met.

Elliot Carver.

Wai Lin,
from the New China News Agency.

I don't recall seeing
your name on the guest list.

It's not. I snuck in.

Why, my dear?

I wanted to meet you.

Outstanding. I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

You should work
in my Beijing bureau.

Mr Carver, you don't have
a bureau in Beijing.

Call me Elliot.

I always wondered
how I'd feel if I saw you again.

Now I know.

Was it something I said?

How about the words
"I'll be right back"?

Something came up.

Something always came up.

And how are you, Paris?
Much better now. We're even.

Drink, Mrs Carver?

Mr Bond will have a vodka
martini, shaken, not stirred.

Mrs Carver will have a tequila.
Straight shot.

No. Mrs Carver will have a glass
of Mr Carver's champagne.

You've moved up
in the world, Paris.

And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

Do you still sleep with
a gun under your pillow?

To you.
No. To the gun.

I take it this isn't
a social visit.

Your husband may be in trouble.

If you're going after him,
you're the one in trouble.

It's either him or someone
in his organisation.

And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

No. That wasn't my plan.

Good. Because I've made my bed.

You don't sleep in it anymore.

There you are.

Darling.

I've been looking for you.

Meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

Hello, Mrs Carver.
It's a pleasure.

And this is James Bond.

You know each other?

Oh, we're old friends.

He dated my roommate
in Zurich.

I'm thinking of getting
Wai Lin behind a news desk.

I'm sure she won't
resist...too much.

Ahem. Elliot, I was wondering
about your satellites,

your global position.

They're merely tools
for information, Mr Bond.

Or disinformation.

If you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments

or people...or even a ship.

That's very interesting,
Mr Bond.

You have a vivid imagination...
for a banker.

You should write a novel.

Heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

Mr Carver.

Hmm? Ah.

It's time to begin
the festivities.

Excuse me. Darling?

How do you really know him?

He's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

You're a terrible liar, dear.

I have a problem with a banker.

Could I see you a moment?

Ladies and gentlemen.

Mr Carver's broadcast will
be starting in 10 minutes.

What kind of banking
do you specialise in, Mr Bond?

Hostile take-overs.

Shall we?

Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

It's nice to talk to the world.

Looks like there's someone

who wants to talk to you.

Mr Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in 5, 4, 3,

2...

Good evening.

Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to celebrate the completion

of the Carver Global
Satellite Network.

But, as you're well aware,

terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea,

which has the potential

to destroy
every human being on earth.

I want to assure my viewers
that I, Elliot Carver,

have spoken with
the prime minister in London

and the chairman
in Beijing...

It's a soundproof room, Mr Bond.

Nobody hears you scream.

We have made contact.
Make him uncomfortable.

I'll be there in a few moments.

..with its printing presses

and its satellite facilities
linking every...

You seem very concerned
about Mr Carver's business.

He wants to know why.

Why did I do it, you ask.

The answer is simple: power.

The power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe,

for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

Maybe we play
a number on his head.

What do I expect in return?

World-wide domination.

Complete, utter, total
world-wide domination,

but not over government
or religion or ideology.

Over tyranny
and isolation and news.

The Carver Network
has the ability. to reach...

Herr Stamper!

But do not fear me,

for tonight I reveal
my Declaration of Principles,

a promise to the men
and women of this planet

whom I so humbly serve.

I promise to report the news
without fear or favour.

I promise to be a force
for good in this world.

Fighting injustice,

crushing intolerance,
battling inhumanity...

It's time...

..for a station break.

..that is the goal
of the Carver...

What's happened?

We've lost power.
What?!

Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay calm.

We will go on
in a few minutes time.

You don't know? You're fired!

And in a rather
embarrassing note,

media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight

during the inaugural broadcast
of his satellite network.

Sorry, Elliot, we didn't do it.

Glorious evening, wasn't it?

Ignore those people.
These things happen.

Not to me. Not to me!

When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

It was a rag,

but the editor taught me
one important lesson.

The key to a great story
is not who or what or when...

but why.

Your friend, Mr Bond,
made a mess tonight.

I want to know why.
I told you, I barely know him.

Barely?

I was curious

who Carver would send.

He's on to you.

Well, we know where you stand.

You've made your bed.

I'm standing in your doorway.

Then turn around and go home.

Tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

That's it? Go home?

I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

It's too late for that.

Why did you marry him?

He told me he loved me.

That always sounds good.

I used to look in the papers
every day for your obituary.

I'm sorry.
I keep disappointing you.

What was it, James?

Did I get too close?

Did I get too close
for comfort?

Yes.

I missed you.

What did you find?

I hacked into the bank.
They're using SS-L2, 128...

Spare me the techno-babble.

Bond's got a perfect
employment record.

He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.

Which means?
Government agent.

If it sounds too good
to be true, it always is.

Do you think my wife knows?

If you dial down
the ambient noise...

James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

Play it again.

Do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

I think we should
set an appointment for my wife

with the doctor.

Do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

I have to go.
No, you don't.

I can get you
out of the country.

No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

You have a choice.
Only if you let him go.

I can't do that.

He has a secret lab
on the top floor.

Paris, you don't
have to do this.

Don't argue with me, James.

You know...

this job of yours...

It's murder on relationships.

Until I get back next week,

I want two guards
24 hours a day.

Nobody gets in.
We'll take care of it.

What do we do
with the satellite?

Send this thing off
to the launch site.

And be careful.
It's worth $300 million.

Looking for a news story?

They'll print anything
these days.

Yes?

Good morning, Mr Bond.
Elliot Carver.

I believe you've got
two items that belong to me.

What are you talking about?

The red box, Mr Bond.

And my wife in your hotel room.

He's coming.

Fingerprint I.D. accepted.

Select security system level.

Tell me if you find the encoder.

Call me immediately.
Ja.

The President said
he can "feel their pain."

Some late news -

it is with great sadness
that we announce the death

of Paris Carver,

the wife of Elliot Carver,

chairman of this network.

According to police
in Hamburg, Germany,

Mrs Carver was found dead

in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances

on which police have refused
to elaborate.

Oh, Paris!

Her body was discovered

along with the body
of an unidentified man,

the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound.

I have a clear shot, Mr Bond.

Stand up...slowly.

Drop your gun
und kick it toward me, ja?

Good.

Now lie down on the bed
next to Mrs Carver.

..we extend our deepest
sympathies to Mr Carver.

It will be
on the news in an hour.

Tomorrow's news today.
Just so.

My name is Dr Kaufman.

I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

Take my word for it, ja?

Get the sledgehammers.

She struggled terribly,
Mr Bond.

It's a pity you got her
involved her in this.

It won't look like suicide
if you shoot me from there.

I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

I could shoot you
from Stuttgart,

und still create
the proper effect.

OW!
Herr Stamper.

My art is in great demand
all over the world, Mr Bond.

I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

Now, I am afraid our little...

Stamper, stop yelling in my ear.

Sir, they can't
get into the car.

You can't be serious.

Did you call the auto club?

Make him tell you
how to open it.

OK, I'll ask.

This is very embarrassing.
There is a red box in your car.

They want me to make you
unlock the car.

I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

You have a doctorate
in that, too?

No, this is more like a hobby.
But I am very gifted.

Oh, I believe you.

My cell phone opens the car...
No, Mr Bond! I do it.

Recall, 3, Send.

Wait.

I'm just a professional
doing a job.

Me too.

Dr Kaufman.

Welcome.
Please fasten seat belt.

Reduce speed.
Pedestrians in roadway.

Obstruction ahead.
Reduce speed now.

Unsafe driving
will void warranty. .

Congratulations
on a safe journey.

U.S. Airbase
South China Sea

U.S. Airbase
South China Sea

Yo, Jimbo!

Wade, what are you doing here?

The world's my office.
This way.

Did Q bring you up to speed?
Yeah. I brought the GPS unit.

Officially, Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.

And unofficially?

We don't want World War III -
unless we start it.

Dr Greenwalt is the
air force GPS expert.

The GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets

in the U.S. military.

Show him what you got!

The missing encoder!
How did you get that?

Picked it up
in Hamburg yesterday.

Could somebody use this
to send a ship off-course?

Like the Devonshire?

Did anyone mention Devonshire?

No...
Good!

So answer
the man's question.

In theory, you could
send a ship off-course.

Like putting a magnet
beside a compass.

Exactly.
Then check this out.

Those two circles should
line up on top of each other.

Somebody's tampered with this.

If we knew where
the Devonshire thought she was,

could you figure out
where she sank?

Sure.

Wade.
Yeah?

I have a small favour to ask.

The high-altitude,
low-opening jump

is where we get
the most fatalities.

For five miles use your oxygen,

or you'll die of asphyxiation.

Like my first marriage.

Pop the chute at 200 feet
below the Chinese radar.

You'll be travelling
over 200 MPH.

Be careful not to crack
your skull open.

I'll keep that in mind.

When you hit the water,

don't forget
to cut away your chute.

90%%% of the people killed
get tangled up and drown.

Seems a lot
to save the world.

I have to prove that ship was
deliberately set off-course.

One minute!
The pick-up set?

The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.

Buddha bless.

I just noticed something.

This is where
the ship thought it was.

This is where it really is.

But see that island there?

Where he's jumping is not
technically Chinese waters.

They belong to Vietnam.

Vietnam?!
Vietnam?!

He have any U.S. government
markings on him?

The parachute,
the wetsuit, the fins!

Jesus, if the Vietnamese
catch him!

He didn't say good-bye.

Still interested
in hostile take-overs?

It's the opportunities to travel
that I like about banking.

Bring the boat over.

Bring the boat over.

What are you looking for?

Get them out of the water.

If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were following me.

We seem to have developed
an attachment to each other.

Hopefully, not for long.

Another Carver building.

I'd say he's developed
an edifice complex.

General Chang.
Friend of yours?

Mr Bond. Miss Lin.

Welcome to Saigon.

Nice to see you, Elliot.

I hadn't intended opening
this centre until tomorrow,

but you can help me write
the inaugural story -

your obituaries.

I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

Actually, Mr Bond,

you wrote her obituary
when you asked her to betray me.

Still, let's see.

British secret service
agent James Bond

and his collaborator
Wai Lin

of the Chinese
External Security Force

were found...

dead this morning
in Vietnam.

Lacks punch, don't you think?

It's old news. We've been
working together for months.

We know what you
and Chang are up to.

I don't think so.

You may have seen
the general just now,

but perhaps you've
not had chance

to peruse today's headlines.

I like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

I never believe
the press anyway.

Therein lies
your problem, Mr Bond.

We're men of action,
but your era is passing.

Words are the new weapons,

satellites the new artillery.

And you become the new
supreme Allied...commander?

Exactly.

Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon his armies,

I have my divisions -
TV, news, magazines.

And by midnight tonight,
I'll have influenced

more people than anyone
in history save God himself.

And the best he managed
was a sermon on the Mount.

You are insane.

The distance between
insanity and genius

is measured only by success.

General Chang is waiting.
If you'll forgive me.

Your appearance has forced me

Your appearance has forced me

to move up
my timetable slightly.

I'll leave you
with Mr Stamper and his toys.

Perhaps you'd like to see them.

Sir, the helicopter.

Mr Stamper is a protege
of the late Dr Kaufman,

who was schooling him in the
ancient art of chakra torture.

He was like a father to me.
Interesting role model.

The body has seven
chakra points -

energy centres -
like the heart or genitals.

These implements
probe those organs,

inflicting maximum pain

whilst keeping the victim alive
as long as possible.

Dr Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

I'm hoping to break it.

Watching your TV shows
is torture enough.

Save this one till last.

When you remove Mr Bond's heart,

there should be enough time for
him to watch it stop beating.

We can use the banner.

Hope it holds.
Get after them!

Ready?
Go!

Oh, sheesh.

Next time,
I'll take the elevator.

Get a car!

No! A bike is quicker.

Keys. Someone
always forgets them.

I'm driving. Get off!
Get on the back.

I'm slipping.

Stop fidgeting!

What are you...
Give me that!

Clutch, clutch, clutch!

Right.
No, left.

Who's driving?

Clutch!

Left! Left!

How many back there?
I can't see. Hold on.

What are you...

Don't get any ideas.
I'd never dream of it.

One. No, two.

Go for the barrels.

Very good.

Hold on!

Let's take the highway.

Helicopter!
Keep your shirt on.

Get on the back.
Are you trying to protect me?

No, I need to balance
the bike.

You ready? Go!

Pop the clutch.

It's behind us.

Get out of the way!

Get down!

Get down!

You see the chopper?
I can't see. Hold on.

Trapped.

Never.

Would you pass the soap?

Over there.

You were pretty good
with that hook.

I grew up in
a rough neighbourhood.

You were pretty good
on the bike.

Well, I didn't grow up at all.

Here. Allow me.

Don't get any ideas, Mr Bond.

Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

Walk hand in hand?

Stick closely to each other.

Maybe we'll go after
General Chang together.

Thanks for washing my hair.

I work alone.

Lucky for you I stopped by.

I could've taken care of him.

Hmm, but you didn't.

Give me the earring.

Copy of a macro-59.
Standard issue, Chinese Army.

Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

Still think you can
do this alone?

Is your mission
peace or revenge?

This is about stopping a war.

Last year, Stealth
material went missing

from one of Chang's bases.

I followed a lead
to Carver in Hamburg.

Stealth material?

We thought he was
building a Stealth plane.

No. Stealth boat.

That's how they got
close to the Devonshire,

to drill inside
the missile room.

They stole a Cruise missile.

He's moving
the timetable to midnight.

He'll position the Stealth boat
near the British fleet

and fire the missile into China.

And we will retaliate.

And Carver
provides the pictures.

I have to warn Beijing.
No.

Let's get our governments
talking. We'll find the boat.

Stand up.

Stand up.

Just like home.

You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

On second thoughts, you type.

First we have to find the boat.

Of all the harbours
and inlets controlled by Chang,

22 are in highly
populated areas.

That leaves 14
to hide the boat in.

It's invisible to radar
but not the human eye.

Very novel.

He'd have to sail to the
Devonshire and back in a night.

This looks familiar.
We made some improvements.

Did you, indeed?

OK, 4 hours out
and 4 hours back.

Assume the boat is
travelling at 30 knots.

I'm a fan
of Chinese technology.

There are four places
where he could harbour the boat.

On your left.

Check those areas.

Ah, a new Walther.

I asked Q to get me one.

I've got it. Look.

Four missing boats,
three unexplained drownings.

Ha Long Bay.

He knows the island.

He says it's dangerous
for boats there at sunset.

But for $5,000, he'll take us.

Good.

Maybe he'll take a cheque.

It's mostly dull routine,

but every now and then,

you get to work
with a decadent agent

of a corrupt Western power.

And they say Communists
can't have fun.

I hate to disappoint you,

but I don't even have
a little red book.

If anything happens to me,

the fuses for the mines
are in here.

We're gonna
finish this together.

And if I may say so,

you've found the right decadent
Western agent as a partner.

See the Stealth?

No.

It's getting late
and this is the last cove.

Yeah, that's it.

Set your timers for 10 minutes.

Time to get out
before it explodes.

If it doesn't sink,
our fleets will finish it.

If they got our message.

OK, you, up and over.

We're in position
between the fleets.

We're in position
between the fleets.

Fire one missile
at each flagship.

The Chinese will think the
British are rattling the sabre.

The British will think the
Chinese are being belligerent.

And the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

Let the mayhem begin.

TMS Bedford. British Fleet.

TMS Bedford. British Fleet.

Missile lock-on.
Signal to Admiralty.

Missile lock-on.
Signal to Admiralty.

"Task crew
under missile attack."

Two waves of land-based
MiG-21s inbound.

Should be on our screens
in 2 minutes.

How long before the MiGs
are within firing range?

12 minutes.

What the hell do I pay you for?

If she's there, Bond is there.
Stamper, find them!

Wai Lin, Wai Lin, camera!

If she blinks, kill her.

You, come with me.

Stamper to bridge.
Bond is dead.

Delicious.

Bring the girl up to me.

Are you sure
you want her up here?

It's my business, Mr Gupta.
I like an audience.

Ah, Ms Lin.

Your countrymen are so
predictably eager to save face.

They know you are here.
They're looking for you.

Not according to our radar.

It seems your MiGs will attack
the British fleet in...?

Nine minutes to firing range.

Even if they were
looking for me,

they can't see me
on a Stealth boat.

Or you. Or your friend,
the late Commander Bond,

who is on his way to the bottom
of the South China Sea.

He's my new anchorman.

Pathetic.

What on earth's going on?

A message from 007, confirmed
by my opposite number in China.

Search for a ship that's
almost invisible to radar.

The Chinese aren't the enemy.

Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

Message from the Admiralty.
Look at this.

Is there anything on the radar
that looks very small?

Lifeboat, periscope?
No, sir.

A Stealth boat -
they've gone mad.

What you're about
to witness, Ms Lin,

is not so much
a missile attack

but the launch
of a new world order.

In 5 minutes, once your
countrymen attack the British,

I shall retaliate
for dear old England

by sending this missile
into Beijing,

where General Chang
has just called

an emergency meeting
of the Chinese high command.

Unfortunately...

General Chang...

will be delayed in traffic,

arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders.

Too late to stop
the air force from sinking

the entire British fleet.

But he will be just in time
to take over the government,

negotiate a truce,

and emerge as a world leader

with the Nobel Peace Prize.

And what do you get?
Me?

Oh...

nothing.

Just exclusive broadcasting
rights in China for 100 years.

Ready to rock and ruin.

Excuse me, my dear.
I have a deadline to meet.

Prepare for
the missile launch.

Mr Gupta.

Hello, Elliot.

Interesting plan.

I have something here
that belongs to you.

So much for German efficiency.

Mr Stamper.

Don't shoot him yet.

Hold your fire.

Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr Bond.

Even trade, Elliot.

Gupta for Wai Lin. You can't
fire the missile without him.

And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

I told you. We're gonna
finish this together.

How romantic.

Do you realise
how absurd your position is?

No more absurd than starting
a war for ratings.

Great men manipulate the media
to save the world.

Look at William
Randolph Hearst,

who told his photographers,
"You provide the pictures,

and I'll provide the war."

I'm just taking it
one step further.

Sorry about that. I, er...tuned
out there for a moment, Elliot.

Touche.

Mr Gupta,

is the missile ready to fire?

Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

Then it seems you've
outlived your contract.

You see, Mr Bond,
I have a back-up plan.

Uh-huh, so do I.

He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

Sir, we have a small
intermittent contact

on the surface plot,
bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

Can't get the range, but
it wasn't there a second ago.

Tell all ships
do not fire on the Chinese

for any reason whatsoever.

Send a message to the Chinese:
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

Get those fires out!

Go and protect the missile.

Oh, and, Mr Stamper,

would you please kill
those bastards?!

Nice work.

They're speeding up.
We have to stop the boat.

Take care of the engine room
and get off the ship.

I'll stop the missile.

Captain, a signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

To Royal Navy task group.

We also have
the unknown ship on our screens.

We will not fire unless
it turns towards China.

Until then she's yours.

Captain, whatever the hell
that thing is, sink it.

Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

Yes, sir.

Right. We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

Bond turned us into the target.

Bond turned us into the target.

Along with himself.

Take evasive action.

Prepare the missile
countdown immediately.

Initialising launch sequence.

T minus 5 minutes
and counting.

T minus 5 minutes and counting.

Sir, they're making 48 knots.

They'll be out of visual range
within 2 minutes.

Keep firing. Slow them down.

The engines are out.
We're sitting ducks here.

Follow me!

T minus 4 minutes and counting.

OK.

Well done. Officer watch,
increase max.

Keep firing!

All hands, abandon ship.
Abandon ship.

Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

Mr Stamper, what are you
doing about the girl?

Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

T minus 3 minutes and counting.

You're too late again,
Mr Bond.

It's a bad habit of yours.
There's nothing you can do.

T minus 2 minutes and counting.

The missile's fully programmed.
It can't restart.

In a matter of minutes,
my plan will succeed.

And thanks largely
to your efforts,

the British Navy
will destroy the evidence.

And I'll be out of here

in a Carver news helicopter
covering the event.

It's going to be
a fantastic show!

I may have some
breaking news for you.

You forgot the first rule
of mass media!

Give the people what they want!

T minus one minute and counting.

Drop it, Mr Bond...

or I'll drop your friend.

It's over, Stamper.

Let her go.

Not between you and me.

James, try to detonate it.

The missile will set them off.

Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.

T minus 40 seconds.

For Carver!

And Kaufman!

I owe you an unpleasant
death, Mr Bond.

Nein!

T minus 20 seconds.

We die together, Mr Bond.

T minus 10 seconds.

Two...

One...

M, Bedford reports that Carver
went down with his ship.

It seems that Bond made it.

Moneypenny, take this release.

Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned

while on a cruise
aboard his luxury yacht

in the South China Sea.

At present, the local
authorities believe

the media mogul
committed suicide.

Commander Bond,

Colonel Lin,

this is the HMS Bedford.

Are you there?

They're looking for us, James.

Let's stay undercover.
