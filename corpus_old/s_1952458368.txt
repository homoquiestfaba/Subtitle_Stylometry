Mr. Robert, are you ready?

You packed already?

Sheriff is kicking you out tomorrow.

He arrived.

I am so glad.

Go ahead, sit in the car.

Check.

Transition, my ass.

Mirko, please.

Mirko, please.

What?!

It's green.

What you looking at?

Motherfucker.

Mirko, please.

Oh, that's Ivana. How are you Ivana?

Hi, how are you, Tosha?

Not so bad.

Goodbye.

Hello Olga.

This is Robert, Branko's friend
from New York.

No thanks, I am in a hurry.

And I think he is tired.

I'll talk to you later.

What is this?

Where the fuck is it?

Motherfucker.

Inventory.

Inventory, can't you read?

C'mon.

Stanka, this is my
friend from New York.

Thank you.

What the hell...

C'mon motherfucker.

It's your turn now.

Do you feel like song?

You're so beautiful today.

We'll throw this away...

C'mon Mister, buy the roses.

C'mon, Mister, for your wife.

C'mon Mister.

Three hundred.

Hundred more.

Why the fuck are you
begging him?

Mirko, shut up, please.

You are begging him
to go to America?!

Mirko, shut up already!

I could have gone to
America any time,

but I didn't want to!

I can see from here how
fucked up they are.

Wait, I mean, everybody
knows that...

Motherfuckers!

Wine for young lady,

and a beer for a gentleman.

Here, if you don't mind.

Enough with these politics!

Come on, you motherfucker!

You grease ball, I'll fuck
you up real good!

Good morning.

Two, please.

Ivana, come in.
What's wrong?

Why are you crying?
What happened?

Robert what?

What happened?

What happened?
All I know is that he's arrested.

Who's arrested?
Branko.

What are you talking about?
What happened?

Why is he arrested?
Because of him.

Sure... no problem.

...shit.

How do you say it...?

Right, that oughta do it...

Thank you so much.

We'll pay you back from New York.

Let's go, we are late.

My best man!

C'mon, play something!

Congratulations,
I wish you all the best!

Thank you.

Sorry, I've gotta go.
Where are you going?

I've gotta rush to the
American embassy.

What about the wedding?

You can celebrate...

What about the groom?

Goodbye.

Hey best man, give us
some money!

My love.

See you.

Close your eyes now.

Not yet, not yet.

Now.

Unbelievable.
