Miles:
Get to bed. (sighs)

Go to sleep.

When's Mommy coming home?

Mommy's in Heaven.
We talked about this.

Selim:
But she'll come home, right?

Like, you go to work
and you come back.

Mom's not coming home.

Selim: Never?

Let's get some rest, okay?

Okay.

Don't forget to
tuck in Ummi.

Okay.


Good night, Selim.

Good night, Ummi.

Love you. (kiss)

Hey, hey. Come on, big man.
We got to get going.

-(egg timer rings)
-Oh, see? It's time to go.

Which one you wanna do?

Selim, which one you wanna do?

Hey, hey, we gotta put
the Legos down for a second.

Which one? I like this suit.
Which one you wanna do?

Hey, son!
What you wanna do, son?
We got to get going, baby.

-Uh...
-Hm?

This.

Okay, well-- (sighs)

Alright, well...

What are you gonna
put the vest on with?

-(rummaging)
-Where'd you put her last?

-Is she in the bed?
-(whimpering)

I can't find Ummi!

Where'd you put
her last, Selim?


See-- (sighs)

I don't need this right now,
not right now.

Not right now. Come on.



Selim!

He's wearing that?

-(rummaging)
-Yep.

He can wear
whatever he wants.

-(rummaging)
-(Selim crying)

Son, are you crazy?
People are gonna talk!

-I don't care what
people have to say.
-Yeah?

Well, you should care.

-I don't care what Selim wears.
-(Selim crying)

Boy, this is your wife's
homegoing service.

-Have some respect.
-He's his own person.

-Let him be who he wants to be.
-You can't coddle him forever!

I'm not coddling him, Pop!

Selim does not process things
the same way that we do!

Ah, that's not normal.

â™ª â™ª

It's not normal.

Stop saying that
he's not normal.

That doll is not normal!

Stop saying that
he's not normal!

-People are not
gonna see autism!
-You think I don't know that?

-Then we gotta teach him
before the world does.
-I'ma teach him.

You can't forever.

-He's only 10.
-He's soft!

Stop saying that he's soft!


Hey, look, uh...

He'll forget all about
that doll real soon.

That doll was the last
thing that she gave him

before she went
in the hospital.
