THAT'S YOUR FUTURE HONKIN'.

SAM, COME ON, PLEASE.

WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

SO, BUDDHA, YOU THINK

BECAUSE SHE'S RICH?

HEY, I BELIEVE IN
THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.

[Jack clearing throat]

OH, HELLO, MR. HOLIDAY.

HELLO, SAM.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING TODAY.

OH, I KNOW.
NICKY WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE SICK, EITHER.

SO, UH, LET'S GO.

WHAT'S THAT?

IT'S CALLED
A "HAND OF FATIMA."

FATIMA WAS
MUHAMMAD'S DAUGHTER.

HER HAND OFFERS PROSPERITY
TO THE NEWLYWEDS.

?
SAM, THIS
THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL

OH, YEAH.

,
AUNT DOTTY, THIS IS ANNA

JACK HOLIDAY,
MY UNCLE KRYSTOFF.

WHY DON'T WE
GO INSIDE?

YES, YES.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

OOH! NICE HAND!

JACK?

YES, SAM.

HOW DO I LOOK?

YOU LOOK JUST FINE.

1, 2, 3, 4!

WELL, YOU'RE FINALLY
GETTING MARRIED?

NOW WE'RE FREE
OF YOU AT LAST?

WHICH IS REALLY
QUITE A BLESSING?

WHEN CONSIDERING
YOUR PAST?

NOW THAT ANNA'S...?

EXCUSE ME. DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

BUT YOU'RE ARABS.
HOW COME YOUR NAME
IS HOLIDAY?

GLORY, GLORY
SAM MASTREWSKI?

MY HUSBAND'S LAST NAME
IS SHOKRULA ALYZIM.

IT'S ARABIC FOR
"THANK GOD FOR THE GOOD DAY."

HE CHANGED IT
AFTER HE CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY.

GOOD DAY?
WHAT GOOD DAY?

GOOD DAY.
LIKE HOLIDAY, YOU DOPE.

I SURE WISH HIS FATHER
HAD THOUGHT

ABOUT CHANGING HIS NAME
TO SOMETHING
AS NICE AS HOLIDAY.

...DRIVE YOUR MOM TO TEARS?

BETTER HURRY
AND GET MARRIED,
GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HERE?

BEFORE SHE KNOWS
THE TRUTH?

COME ON, EVERYBODY.

GLORY, GLORY,
SAM MASTREWSKI?

YOU PICKED A PRETTY GIRL?

HOW DID THAT ONE
GET IN THERE?

MOM, IS THAT YOU?

...YOU-SKI?

YOUR FATHER HAD BEEN PLANNIN'
A TRIP TO SPAIN FOR YEARS.

SOMEHOW HE JUST NEVER
SEEMED TO FIND THE TIME.

SO I HAD THIS PICTURE
TAKEN FOR HIM,

SORT OF LIKE
A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

MARRY ANNA WE IMPLORE?

[Speaking Arabic]

BEFORE SHE KNOWS
THE TRUTH?

THE CLOSEST YOUR FATHER
EVER CAME TO A VACATION

WAS SATURDAY NIGHT BOWLING
WITH THE LEAGUE.

WHEN SHE FINALLY LEARNS
THE TRUTH-SKI?

YOU'RE
ANNA'S HEADACHE NOW??

[All clapping]

[Tapping glass]

I JUST WANT TO SAY
IN SPITE OF WHAT
WE'VE JUST SEEN,

I'M STILL HAPPY TO WELCOME
SAM AND HIS FAMILY
INTO OUR FAMILY.

[All laughing]

[Speaking Arabic]

E,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AG

I FOUND AN OIL TANKE
R IN SAUDI ARABIA

THAT WAS LEAVING
FOR THE STATES,

AND I TOOK A JOB
IN THE GALLEY
IN EXCHANGE FOR MY PASSAGE.

Y,
I HAD VERY LITTLE MONE

BUT EVERY DAY,
I BOUGHT A PACK OF GUM
FROM THE SHIP'S STORE.

I HAD SEEN AN AMERICAN MOVIE
AND IN IT RICHARD WIDMARK
CHEWED A LOT OF GUM.

I BELIEVED THAT IF
I CHEWED ENOUGH GUM,

I WOULD STEP OFF THE SHIP,
TRANSFORMED INTO AN AMERICAN
LIKE RICHARD WIDMARK.

[All laughing]

M.
NOW I MAKE THAT GU

[all clapping]

MILLIONS
AND A BEACH HOUSE, MAN
! HOLIDAY AND SON!

THE SHIP DOCKED
IN GALVESTON.

I HAD 72 RIALS
IN MY POCKET.

IT WAS ALL THE MONEY
I HAD IN THE WORLD.

THERE WAS A BANK
ACROSS THE STREET.
I WENT INSIDE.

THE CASHIER TOOK MY MONEY,
AND SHE COUNTED IT TWICE.

HERE IT COMES, MAN.

VERY CAREFULLY.

THEN SHE OPENED A DRAW
ER AND HANDED ME

MY NEW MONEY,

ONE $20 BILL.

I TOOK THAT BILL,
AND I SAT DOWN ON A BENCH
THAT WAS THERE IN THE BANK.

I SAT AND I STARED

AT MY FIRST REAL PIECE
OF AMERICA.

,
I GUESS FOR MOST IMMIGRANT
IT'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY

THE NEW YORK SKYLINE,
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

BUT FOR ME,

IT WAS THAT $20 BILL.

IT SEEMED TO ME I WAS
HOLDING MY ENTIRE WORLD
OF POSSIBILITIES

RIGHT THERE IN MY HANDS.

THAT'S YOU, MAN. GO, GO.

I WANT YOU AND MY DAUGHTER
TO HAVE A CHANCE

TO FEEL THAT YOUNG
AND UNSTOPPABLE.

THINK OF IT
AS YOUR WEDDING PRESENT.

A WEDDING PRESENT.

WHOA.

IS THAT ALL?


WHEN YOU WERE A BOY, SAM,
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO?

YOU MUST HAVE HAD DREAMS.

.
UH, I DON'T REMEMBER

TRY. IT'S IMPORTANT.

HOLD THAT MAN!

SORRY, BOSS!

COME ALONG QUIETLY NOW.
WE DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE NO UGLY SCENE.

ANNA, l... I GUESS I'M LEAVING.

IT'S OK, ANNA.
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

[Party horn blowing]

THIS IS GREAT, ISN'T IT?

THIS IS JUST
FUCKING WONDERFUL.

THAT WAS ONE INTENSE SPEECH
MR. HOLIDAY GOT INTO.

.
IT'S EASY FOR HIM
TO SAY, RIGHT?
HE'S LIVING IN HIS DREAM

WHO'S RICHARD WIDMARK,
I MEAN?

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNO
W WHAT I WANT TO DO?

I MEAN, LIKE I REMEMBER
READING ABOUT HIM SOMEWHERE.

THERE NEVER WAS ANY
"WHAT I WANTED TO DO."

IT WAS JUST WHAT I DID.

LIFE'S DEALT YOU
SUCH A CRUEL BLOW.

ONE THING'S FOR SURE.
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO WORK FOR THE GUY ON MONDAY.

OH, HEY, THERE'S AN OPENING
AT THE BODY SHOP.

WELL, HOW'S THAT FEEL?

ARE HIS THINGS.

E?
WHERE IS H

WHO, DAD?

YEAH.

UH, l... I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
THEY HAVE A ROOM DOWNSTAIRS.

HE'S IN
THIS BUILDING?

HE WAS PLAYING BINGO,
AND HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM HERE
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

T.
I KNOW THA

I JUST THINK
IT'S STRANGE
THAT HE'S HERE.

YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
AT THE HOSPITAL.

I WAS OUT.

DON'T YOU CHECK
YOUR MESSAGES?

YES, I CHECK MY MESSAGES,
BUT IT WAS A MESSAGE FROM DAD.

I WASN'T ABOUT T
O CALL HIM BACK.

I MEAN, HE DIDN'T EXACTL
Y CALL ME UP AND SAY,

R,
"HI, EMILY.
THIS IS YOUR FATHE

I'M OVER
AT THE HOSPITAL DYING."

PLEASE STAND
AND GATHER ROUND.

COME IN, PLEASE.

[Man coughs]

BRUCE ADAMS
IS NO LONGER WITH US.

AND WE, HIS FRIENDS
AND FAMILY,

WILL ALL MISS HIM.

[Hoist clanking]

[Machine whirring]

RECENTLY I'VE BEEN THINKIN
UH, ABOUT HOW, UH, LIFE

IS LIKE A, UH, A BILL
FOR A CREDIT CARD YOU GE
T AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO PAY IT,

YOU HAVE TO FACE
THE DEBT THAT YOU OWE.

BUT INSTEAD OF GRIEVING IT,

[speaking loudly]
YOU CAN THINK INSTEAD
IN A MORE POSITIVE WAY

AND HAVE
FOND MEMORIES ABOUT...

[machine stops whirring]

[Speaking softly]
AND HAVE... HAVE FONDER MEMORIES
ABOUT, SAY,

A LOVELY GIFT
YOU MIGHT HAVE PURCHASED,

A SPONTANEOUS HOLIDAY
YOU TOOK WITH YOUR WIFE,

THAT LOVELY LUNCH YOU HAD
OR DINNER.

LET'S REMEMBER
THAT REALLY, THE FUN

IS IN THE JOURNEY,
NOT IN GETTING THERE.

[Metal clanging]


LET US PRAY.

IT'S MY OWN COMPANY:

"
"NEIL CAMPBELL,
HAIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW.

AND, UH, YOU WORRY,

I CAN TELL
'CAUSE IN YOUR CASE...

UH, SEE, YOU...
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU,
UH, YOU HAD HAIR...

SO IS THAT
YOUR YOUNG MAN?

OH, UH, HE'S JUS
T A FRIEND.

.
YOU STRIKE ME... YOU STRIKE M
AS AN... AS AN ATTRACTIVE GUY

.
HE SEEMS LIKE
A FINE YOUNG MAN

E.
VERY AGGRESSIV

IT SEEMS YOU HAVE
A LOT OF STRESS
ON THE JOB.

AGAIN I WOULDN'T SAY THIS
IF I DIDN'T CARE.

I, UH, WANT SOMEONE
WITH A LITTLE LESS DIRECTION.

E.
I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
FOR THE AGGRESSIVE TYP

YOU KNOW, MY MOTHE
R, I THINK SHE NEEDS
ME IN THE KITCHEN.

IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL...

EMILY, YOUR FATHER
WAS SUCH A KIND MAN.

BEHIND THE EARS
AND THEN, BINGO,

[Crickets chirping]

SO HOW ARE WE...
WHAT ARE YOU...

STILL THE WORLD'S
GREATEST APPLE PIE.

DO YOU WANNA KNOW
MY SECRET INGREDIENT?

WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS.

IT'S PEARS.

I DON'T USE APPLES,
I USE PEARS.


[Doorbell rings]

OH, IT'S ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE FLOWER DELIVERIES.

I DON'T THINK I HAVE
ENOUGH CASH FOR A TIP.

THERE SHOULD BE SOME MONEY
IN YOUR FATHER'S WALLET.

GARY PUT
THE BOX UPSTAIRS.

BE A DEAR AND GO GET
A COUPLE OF DOLLARS.

.
OK

NEVER MIND!
I FOUND SOME CHANGE!

YOUR FATHER CARRIED
HIS FIRST STORY
IN HIS WALLET

UNTIL THE PAPER CRUMBLED.

WHAT?

.
HE WROTE STORIES

QUITE A FEW
OF THEM, ACTUALLY.

W-W-WAIT. DAD WROTE?

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

HE TOOK ALL THE MONEY
YOUR GRANDPARENTS HAD SAVED
FOR HIM TO GO TO COLLEGE.

ABOUT $6,000.

.
WE MOVED TO NEW YORK

HE WROTE THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE THERE.

NOTHING WORKED OUT.

A COUPLE OF THINGS
ALMOST GOT PUBLISHED,
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT.

WHEN WE LEFT NEW YORK,

ALL YOUR FATHER HAD LE
FT OF THE $6,000

WAS ABOUT WHAT YOU'R
E HOLDING NOW.

MOM. MOM, WHY... WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

WHY?

WE WERE ON A TRAIN
TO COME HOME.

HE LOOKED AT ME
AND HE SAID,

"I'M GONNA BE BACK.
I'M GONNA BE BACK HERE, RUTH."

.
HE KNEW HE WASN'
T EVER COMING BACK

YOU ONLY FIND
THAT KIND OF COURA
GE ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.


I GUESS I'LL GIVE
ALL OF HIS SUITS

TO THAT TENT CITY
PROJECT DOWNTOWN.
