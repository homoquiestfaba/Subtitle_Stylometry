Yesterday, my son was playing...

Going through the crates
for a piece of fruit...

One of the packages was open,
a small tear...

He nearly died in his mother's arms...

from this poison you've asked me to hide.

We will forget what we have seen.

This act of mercy will bring
no threat to your honor.

Next time, don't make an
agreement you cannot fulfill.

Man, you are so tight. You're wound up.

Sorry, I said, "Next time."
What I meant was next life.

My apologies, Mrs. Kim.

Maybe, in your next life,
choose your husbands more wisely.

Go on. Go on. Go on!

Your time is up!

Jazz man... so it is you...

Long time no see.

It is you whose time is up...

We agreed. No women! No children!

Let the Lord have you, sister.

Look, your family is waiting for you, kid.

I'm gonna be out of here in one minute,
and then you'll be with them again.

I know you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

God forgive me for saving your life.

You're on your own in this world,

and you gotta learn
to handle it on your own.

I ain't no fit parent, no way.

How did my real mom and dad die?
In a gang fight.

Caught in the crossfire. Innocent.

It was your old man's dying wish
that I look after you.

That's the way the cards are dealt, Chance.
Ain't nothing you can do about it.

See, him, his mom up and died.
I didn't have no choice.

Max "Coolbreeze" Templeton
ain't no charity case.

No, sir.

Do as I do.

Didn't I tell you
to stay the hell out of my goddamn den?

Murder.

Get out of here.

Nigga, what you got to say?

Cool.

Get out of here.

Move it.

Now, you walk through this door,
and you're in hell with nowhere to turn back.

Welcome to purgatory.

You think you can fight?
You're damn right.

All right. Kick my ass.

See, the reason you can't hit me,
'cause you ain't feeling my rhythm.

I could bust you up all day,
'cause you ain't kicking no rhythm.

In life, it's all about the flow.

Find your rhythm and you'll be unstoppable.

2 more things you're gonna have to learn,

the hardest 2 things
about our profession.

What's that?

Shooting a man for the first time

and being shot the first time.

What if I don't get shot?

There you go.

Come on, let's clean that up.

Call, sir.

I'll take it all, the first shot.

You ready?

Cheers.

I like the tattoos. This, this...

God damn you.

God doesn't care about people like us.

Yo, Chance. What's up, man?

Yo, I'm calling to find out how you like
that new track I blessed you with, man.

Yo, call me when you get a minute, man.

And make sure
you get all my gear back this time, all right?

No scratches, please. Yo, call me, man.
All right.

Him, his mom up and died.
I didn't have no choice.

That's the way the cards are dealt, Chance.
Ain't nothing you can do about it.

Yo.
This track is scratched.

What?
The groove is off.

You freestyled
to way harder grooves than this, man.

You can do this one in your sleep.

You got to lay down a new beat.

Dude, you know how much
we're getting paid for this beat? It's done.

I'm off it. It's personal.
Oh, jeez.

This is it. This is Angel's Merc.
Right.

Now, when I'm ready,
you put the window through.

I want a good shot of her
looking really angry.

All right.
Relax.

For Christ sakes,
you're getting 500 big ones for this.

All right, fellows. Time to go.
You're trespassing.

Piss off. Speak to Lenny.

God damn it.

Is everything cool?
He just needs to walk it off.

It's good to see you, Miles.
Anytime, every time.

Matt, this is Ty.

Ty. I'm sure Miles has told you about
some of the concerns we've been having,

and I've got a lot of them.

Let me just say that
Ty is the perfect liaison for this job.

He knows the people,
understands the culture,

speaks the language and knows protocol.

As far as Angel being safe is concerned,

I give you my word,
and my word goes a long way.

That's why we got you here, Miles.

Knock it out the block.
I intend to.

I've never had a package fall, never.
Angel won't be the first.

It's like I always say, I'd put myself down
before I let a client come to harm.

Stop. No. No. Come here.

You serious? You serious?

We've been working for 11 hours straight
and still making the same mistakes, Tamara.

This is not my first album.
The vocals need to be here.

Tamara, I know
you have more in you than this.

Take 5 and come back and show me.

Angel, I really need you
to make a final decision on an outfit.

Everyone hates the album.

What, your album?
No, The Beatles.

Yeah, my album.
No one hates it.

Then why hasn't anyone bought it yet?

I don't know that, you know,
but I know it takes time.

You put out something
that people weren't expecting.

Yeah, I did.

I put myself out there, Matt.
This album is me.

It's all of my heart, and it's echoes of things
that I've given up to get to where I am.

Parts of me
that I'm just never gonna get back.

Hey, Angel.

Yeah.

Trust your instincts.

You're the only family I have, Matt.

Get some sleep, kiddo. Tomorrow, Bangkok.

That's Japanese, Matt.
Whatever.

Good night.
Good night.

Is that a pistol in your hand,
or are you just happy to see me?

Remember him?

Pretty good- looking boy, Miles is, ain't he?

Move again...
Watch yourself, boy.

Why did you lie to me?

I need to use the bathroom.

For 11 years, you said he was dead.

You were better off
not knowing where he was.

Who are you to decide?

I've been making decisions for you
since you were a buck.

You gave me a brother,
then you took him away.

Why?

Easy, Chance.

Because you let me.

You want to know
why I told you your brother was dead?

Because I think he ain't like you and me.

Miles is better off moving on with his life,
forgetting about us.

You see, I think he's too stupid.
He got too much heart.

He wrote you letters!

I almost killed the fucking mailman

because every day he had another letter
from Miles, trying to get in touch with you.

Letting you think he was dead

was the only way
I could get you to let him go.

I didn't keep you from finding your brother.
I kept him from finding you.

You're a stone- cold killer, just like me.

Everything I am, you taught me.
Everything I did was to make you proud.

But now I know that I am nothing like you.

I'm the man that made you.
I'm the cloth you're cut from!

Now, you walk through this door,
and you're in hell with nowhere to turn back.

Welcome to purgatory.

Time for your last lesson.

I ain't your old man no more. I can't be.

You're in the life now.

Time may come when you and
I may have to go heads- up. Dig it?

Are you listening to me?

This ain't no stage joke. This is the deal.

Vietnam burned me out.

I ain't no good for nothing else but this,
but you're different.

You've got a talent for it. You'll do all right.

Ain't nothing else I can teach you.

Just remember, don't get close to nobody.

They'll just as easy replace you
as the other guy.

I ain't got nothing else.

See this locket?

That's your real family.

Wear it close to your heart.

That's the only family you're gonna have
from here on.

Fat Rick's Rib Shack.
Cise.

Take your order.

Now, your mother didn't teach you
to answer the phone like that, did she?

I'm joking, dawg. Relax.

Bangkok. Who's the new MC?

Well, after you passed the mike,
they went to the next names on the A- list.

But they must really want this girl butchered
because the new MC is a monster.

And it ain't just one.

It's a husband- and- wife team.

They love killing
as much as they love each other.

Paris, 2005, 60 dead, one target.

London, 2001, whole city block,
gone, 2 targets.

Know their code names?
Collateral and Damage.

Bangkok better re- up on body bags.

Good boy.

Don't you love these moments?

Damn.

Did you sweep the windows?
All around.

And the dressing rooms?
Twice.

What about the restrooms?
Miles, everything's been checked.

What about the roof?

I checked it earlier.
We'll have a guard up there tonight.

I'll double- check it myself, and after that,
I want a man up there at all times.

Okay.

Chance!

I can't believe this.

What are you doing here, man?

Did you get any of my letters?

No.

I didn't think he'd give them to you.

How is Dad?

Not good.

Walk with me. You're getting faster, man.

Roof is secure. I'm coming down.

When you're young,
ain't got no place to go,

there's a lot you can get into,
none of it good.

But, you know, you come up,
make a name for yourself.

To tell you to truth, I was jacked up.

So as soon as I could
is when I joined the Marine Corps.

Unlearned all that hustling crap real quick.

When I got out, I joined the force, DC,
and SWAT.

Then a friend of mine
turned me on to this whole security thing.

And now here I am in Bangkok.

Who would've thought it actually
feels better saving lives than taking them.

We go where life takes us, Miles.

Maybe, but not always.

Look, man, I'm here for a reason.
Yeah, I figured that.

Your client has a contract out on her.
Really?

We ain't kids no more, Chance. We're grown.
I ain't playing games. I'm a professional.

You got any intel?

Miles, you know what I do.

This is serious.

People are coming to Bangkok,
probably here right now,

and they're coming to kill your singer.

And they'll kill you or anybody else
who gets in the way to finish the job.

Miles, I'm one of the best,
and I'm telling you, she's an easy mark.

Any amateur can pull this off.
You get in the way, you're getting done, too.

I know, because I'm the one
who got the contract first.

So, what? Am I supposed to be scared,

because you show up after all these years
talking about this junk?

Don't get it twisted.
Scared got nothing to do with it.

Just like I got you on the roof,
she can be got, too.

You better check yourself, little brother.

On the roof, you'd have got got.

And know this, I'm one of the best.

So if people are coming,
they'd better come strong,

because I've got something for them.

That would have included you, too.

Miles, if I took this contract,
you would not have been able to stop me.

If you took the contract,
I'd have to put you in a body bag!

You know what, man?

Why don't you get out of here.
Why don't you get?

You're not helping the situation.

You do you, I'm gonna do me.

Get off...

Do you have ID?

Okay, we ready?
Let's do it.

Let's do it! Come on.

No, no, no.

Is someone gonna tell me
what the hell just happened?

Hey! Don't you two talk?

Miles, tell your client to shut up.

Excuse me? You don't talk to me like that.

A, I wasn't talking to you.

B, I'm not on the job,
and, C, you better stay in your place.

Where are we going?
A safe spot.

Watch out!

Step on it!

Down!

Faster, Chance!
I got it.

Why was a cop shooting at us?
That was no cop.

Who was it?
There's a contract out for your life.

Hey, can I have...

Okay. Reality check, guys.

I don't work for the government.
No one wants me dead.

Take me back to my manager right now!

You'll be dead by sunrise.

Fine, then take me to the police.

Can't take the risk
that the police are bought and paid for.

Why me?
You're a nice paycheck.

Stop here.

Why are we stopping here?

We are going to collect our minds.

And then we're going to proceed
to the safe spot.

Okay. Safe spot.

Right. Great.

Matt cared enough about you to hire me.

I have a lot of experience
handling these situations.

You're going to be okay. Trust me.

I have a choice?

It's my duty to get you home safe.
That's what I'm going to do.

Here, Angel, why don't you sit down
and relax for a little while?

Man, what are you doing?

Praying, man.
We need all the help we can get.

Whatever, man.

You, more than most,
have a lot to be thankful for.

Well, there you go, huh?

You remember us playing as kids?

I remember you used to play.

I used to get my ass kicked.

I had your back.
True.

No matter who, you would serve them.

I still have your back.

I'm gonna always have your back.

I hope you have my back, too.

Then why'd you walk out on me and Pops?

That was a different time, a different me.

I'm a man now.

I know you, man.

I know what's in your heart.

Since we were kids,

you didn't have any choice
but to fall into the lifestyle you fell into.

You trying to burn some incense for me,
take away all my sins?

I can't do that.

Only the big man can.

I chose this life.

Pops had a little something to do with it,
but he made me better for it.

Taught me to be the best,
be a professional.

I got no regrets,
and there's no turning back.

I've done things, Miles,
things that can't be changed.

My first job,
I was just this wingman to a merc.

We had a target in the kitchen,
wife and kids lined up against the wall.

All of a sudden,
this merc pops the whole family.

The target had it coming.

The wife and kids,

it's like I killed them myself.

Do you think I could
just burn some incense for that?

You've broken the
5th commandment, Chance.

You're not the first,

you won't be the last.

Will God forgive you for that?

I don't know.

But I do.

Do as I do.

Do as I do.

Done.

Let's go, Angel.
I'm coming.

I need a pedicure and a manicure
as soon as I get back.

I can't believe you got me here
in my dress and my heels.

What are we doing here, again?
Window- shopping.

Window- shopping.

Hey, I've got to go to the bathroom.

I really have to go. Please.

You heard the lady.

What, you don't want her
to get messy, do you?

Go.
Easy.

You know, he's a lot nicer than you are.

You're so mean.
Would you stop pushing me?

Go over there.

May I have some privacy, please?

Privacy.

Please. Please.

Now, you move.

What are you looking at?

The safety is on.

That's bull. This is a Walther P22.
They have no safeties.

Now that's impressive.

Now wipe that smirk off your face.
I swear to God!

Just take me back to my manager's hotel.

Hey, look at me.

Playtime is over.

Don't move and stay down!

No!

Come on, man!

Get up!

No. No. No.

No, God!

Don't move.

I wasn't going to say anything.

Where are we going now?
I'm calling a friend.

You actually have one?

Cise.

Yo. My God, what are you doing, man?

I need a local.

You haven't checked in,
in, like, 3 days, man.

What's your location?
Bangkok.

Bangkok.
This is bullshit.

You know you're not
supposed to get involved...

A name, Cise, now!
Okay. All right, all right, let me find it.

Give me a contact.
I'm working on it, man.

I need to gear up.

DJ Renegade. He's got a gig spinning
at a place called Bangcocked.

Yo, can you be safe out there, please?

Thank you, brother.

Let's move.

Let's move.

Hey, man. Let's go.

You're making a lot of noise, brother.

Sometimes it can't be helped.

You're bringing a lot of heat to everybody.
I mean everybody.

Come to the back room

Take what you want and leave.

I need a first- aid kit.

We've identified the suspect
from last night's abduction...

Consider this priority one.

He's a cop killer.

What the hell's all this for?
Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it. Who the hell are you?

You're a damn whackjob is what you are.

And where the hell's the other guy,
whatever the hell his name is.

Miles Templeton, that's who he was.

He died for you tonight,
and you didn't even know his name.

What are you talking about?
I'm talking about my brother Miles.

He took the hit
that had you written all over it.

I didn't know.
I thought he was just a big screw- up.

That's right, a big screw- up that took
my brother's life for a spoiled brat like you.

Look, I don't know what's happening, okay?
I just... I came...

That's right, you don't know.

But you probably never thought
of anybody but yourself.

Miles was always there for me.

He's the only reason
why you're alive tonight,

so keep your mouth shut
and do as you're told.

God!

Let me.

Just relax.

Let me get it.

This is going to sting a little bit, okay?

What do we do now?

Miles had a plan, a safe spot.

Gotta get you to it.

Okay.

Okay.

Elders, I come to you with great respect...

...and to seek your advice.

Many of you have enlisted our services,
and you know we have never failed you.

My love is dead.

The man responsible for killing her
is the student of an enemy

that I crossed blades with a long time ago.

So this is now a matter of revenge
and of honor for me.

I offer my fees for killing the girl
as compensation if you help.

Who the hell is it?
Hey, old man.

What the hell do you want?

Your boy's all over the news.
It's Chance, he's fucked up big time.

So what?

Max, he's your boy. It's you or him.

Where is he?
Bangkok.

I just want to go home.

Please, could you just...

Could you just take me
back to my manager's now?

Not yet.

This is not about saving me.
You're not here to protect me.

You're just... You're just using me.
You're just using me for bait.

You want to hang with me
so that these guys can keep coming

so that you can get
the guy responsible for killing Miles.

That's exactly what you want.

If I'd have taken you back,
you'd be dead, and so would they.

I don't know if that would happen.

I want to go home.

I'm leaving.
You can just handle this your damn self.

Don't go out there!

Come on.

Come on.

Shut off your engine. Show your hands!

We know you killed the officer
at the concert last night.

I don't understand you, man.

And you kidnapped the singer.

You think you can do
whatever you want in Thailand?

Enough!

Let me handle this.

He says you killed a cop.

There's nothing in the world I hate more
than cop killers.

Do you know what we do
to cop killers in Russia?

Listen! You've got to get me out of here.

Put him in the cell.

I'm in. He's mine.

We're out of here.

Oh, my God. He's here. He's here!

You're going to be safe now.

I know.

Why are you still crying?

I was 14.

I was 14, about to sign my first deal.

And there was this guy, Sean.

God, I was 14, you know?
He'd play his guitar and sing.

One thing led to another, I got pregnant.

And I found out pretty quick
that labels are afraid to sign

a 14- year- old pregnant, unwed singer.

I had to give up my baby.

I had to give up my baby.

I had to give up my baby.

I just feel like everything I've done
has been for nothing.

I've given up so many things
for this business, for my career.

And for what?

I lost the most important thing in my life
a long time ago.

Time to get you home.

Angel. Oh, my God. Thank God you're safe.

I've been trying to get back to you all night.
It's been crazy out there.

I know.

Chance, this is Matt.

Hey, we've got to get you checked out,
all right?

I want to make sure you're... Come on.

Come on!

I'll be right there to check on you.

Hey, no, no, no.
That was good work out there.

I appreciate that, okay? Thank you.

I want to pay you something.

You speak English? I really appreciate it.

Take this.

It's good. Way to get her to the safe spots.

If you ever need a bodyguard job,
security job, I'm going to call you, okay?

I gotta go. I gotta check on her.
I gotta check on her.

Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.

Purpose of visit?

Cleaning.
Excuse me, sir?

Business, ma'am. Just business.

Welcome to Thailand.
Thank you.

Here you go.
Thanks.

Where's Chance?

Chance had to run a couple errands.

I would like to introduce you
to your new bodyguard, however.

What?

Oh, my God.

What's going on?

You did this?

Angel, so quick. Quick. Quick. Quick.

Why?
Why?

First of all, you put out
a garbage- ass album, Angel.

How can...
Yes.

"It echoed of things that are from my soul,
things that I can't get back..."

Garbage, Angel. Garbage, all right?

And it just needed the right PR push.

What?

I made a deal with Ominous Records.

And, well, since I own the rights
to all your songs...

How could...
...and you have enough

for about 6 albums, well...

How could you do this to me?

Angel, bottom line,

you're worth more to me dead
than you are alive.

It's all about the money for you?

What else is there?

Do your job!

Okay.

It's good. Way to get her to the safe spots.

Angel.

No. She's tied up.

You killed my woman, now I got yours.

Come get her.
Where? When?

Your last so- called safe spot.

Hello, Agent Luai.

Where?

Where?!

What are you doing?

We have some unfinished business,
you and me.

Chance!

Was that your brother
at the market, Chance?

I know a lot more about you,
where you come from.

Did the jazz man ever tell you
what happened to your parents?

How you came to be his boy?

Well, I blew your daddy away.

Your mother,
I was debating what to do with her,

until the jazz man shows up,
bullets start flying.

Next thing you know, she's dead.

You know what? It was all because of me.

You shoot that gun, and we all die.

That's cool.

I plan on taking my time with you.

In life, it's all about the flow.

Find your rhythm.

Get the hell away from him!

No.

Shit.

Are you all right?

We're out of here.

You got to leave.
No, no. I don't want to go.

You've got to leave now.
No, I'm not leaving without you.

Listen to me!
I'm not going to go without you, no!

Angel!
No! No!

You saved me in more ways
than you'll ever know.

Thank you.

There's nobody in here
but a squirrel trying to get a nut!

Who are you?

A musician.

I'm here to play my last tune.

Put the gun down.

Put my weapon down? Nigga, please.

For the love of God, man,
put the gun down!

Man,

what does God got to do with it?

No! No!

No!

Angel! Angel! Angel!

Angel! Angel!

Angel, this is for you.
You have 2 minutes.

I'll be right there.

Angel! Angel! Angel!

Okay.

I'm glad it's going to be you.

Sorry, son.

Chance Templeton is dead.

What are you talking about?

When I found you,

I thought you'd been given a second chance.
Now I've got mine.

I have always handled our business.

I'll take care of this.

Now get your ass out of here.

I'm right behind you.

I've always been right behind you.

We have you surrounded.
