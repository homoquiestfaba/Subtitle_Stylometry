[Overlapping chatter
in many languages]

Class, ready?

Joey, hold the turkey
real high when you come out.

Everybody, remember,
smile. Smile. Good.

Woman reporter:
Governor Rhodes!

Governor Rhodes,
people say

you're punishing
the underprivileged.

How do you
respond to that?

Governor, do you have
anything to say

in your defense?

Welcome to our
Thanksgiving feast.

We come in peace.

We have brought you
our bounty.

Thank you
for your kindness.

Please join us
for our feast.

Governor: I was voted in
by the people of this state

who are tired
of preferential treatment.

I believe all Californians
should be treated equally.

Thank you. I'm gonna
get back to my office.

Oh, my God.
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

Shit!

Shit!

Let's go.
Come on! Get in!

[Tires squeal]

I'll find 'em.

Governor: I don't
know how they got through.

Reporter:
Somebody give me a mike.

Open up the trunk,
would you, please?

Reporter: Governor!
Governor Rhodes!

[Reporters shouting]

And we pray for who?

Future progress,

Harmony,

and so that we
can all get along. Amen.


Man: Oh, you sorry?

You scared, now,
ain't you?

You wanna run like a punk?

Go on, then, bitch.

Bee-atch.

Run.

Thanks.

Hyah!

Man: Gary!
I need you out here!

[Telephone rings]

[Ring ring]

Woman: I'll get it, dad.

[Ring ring]

Hello, Video Exchange.

Man: Yo, Jenny,
what's up?

Why haven't you
called back, Jimmy?

Mom's really pissed off.

What now?

Jenny: Well,
your stupid brother

got suspended from school.

He stole a test.

Let me talk to mom.

No, she's not here.

Well, can you tell her
to call me?

Look, I'm only gonna be
in the dorm

for another half hour,
all right?

All right,
but you better wait for her.

See you tomorrow.

Bye, Jenny.

Shit.

We're not gonna have
enough chairs.

It's fine.

With your sister
and your brother-in-law,

we're only nine.
We'll manage.

Herbie,
I want you not to worry.

I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

I don't--I didn't
even mention her.

How much--
how much are these?

4.99
at your checkstand.

Spend over $100
and get a free turkey.

Come on, Herb,
let's go.

Spend over $100,
you get a free turkey.

Got to find this polenta
for Sarah.

Girl: Mommy,
I want this one.

Let's get
this big fat one.

Oh, no, honey.

I don't want
a big fatty butt turkey.

Come on.
Let's pick an organic one.

Get down. Move.

23 pounds.

Do you think
it's gonna be big enough?

Oh, it's big enough.

[Speaking Spanish]

What else?

Oh, Bobo's got
the hiccups.

What else?

Pobre chica.

Let's see.
We need cereal--

Oh!

Dad.

Â¡Hola!

Â¡Hola! Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡?

Hola, Linda.

Wow.
She's gotten so big.

Wow, que Linda.

How you doing?

Good. Good.

You alone?

Yeah, um...

Getting a few things
for turkey day, you know?

Where are you,
um, going tomorrow?

Like I said,
I'm alone now. So...

I--I guess you could
come over to our house.

Nah, I don't know how happy
your mom would be about that

right now.

It'll be fine.

I know that she would
want you to come, right?

You sure?
I mean, maybe.

Yeah.

Well, you know, we gotta

get the rest of
the stuff, so...

All right.
I'll...

OK, all right.

Uh...I-I'll see you guys.

Bye, dad.
Ok, bye-bye.

You're in deep shit.

It's fine.
It's Thanksgiving.

No. You should have
asked her.

[Laughter and kisses]

[Telephone rings]


Hello.

Gina: Hi, mom.

Oh, Gina, hi.
How are you, sweetie?

I'm fine.
How are you?

I-I'm good. I'm OK.

Everything's ok
here.

Yeah, listen. Don't do
all the work tonight

'cause I want to be
there when you're doing it.

OK, I promise.

And tell Anthony to
get off his flabby butt

and help you out.

OK, I will. He...
Everything,

he'll be good. He's fine.
He's trying very hard.

Listen, I'm very glad,
I'm very glad

you're bringing your
boyfriend with you.

You're going to
really like him, mom.

Yeah. One more
thing.

Um...There's a lot
of traffic tomorrow,

so drive safely, OK?

Well, listen.
The change is running out,

so I'm gonna get going.

And don't work too hard.

Bye.

OK. Love you.

Shit.

[Telephone rings]

I want my walkman back.

Hello.

Jimmy, when are you
coming back?

Hi, mom. I'm sorry.

I've been real busy
with school.

When are you coming?

Your brother's in trouble.

I know. Jenny told me.

Look, mom, I just found out
my schedule for mid-terms.

I don't think I'll be able
to come home.

The family will understand.

Study is the most important
thing, huh?

Mom, I'd better get back
to class. I gotta...

I'm going to be late.

Just say "hi"
to everyone, OK?

Ok. Don't forget
to eat, huh?

Don't forget to
take a break, OK?

OK, bye.
Bye, mom.

Jenny, let's go
shopping.

Sorry, mom. I've got
to go to the library.

Duc...

Rachel: All right, then.
Here's your bag.

Carla: You're all set.

Woman: Well, thank you
for looking after me.

OK.
You're welcome.

Now, you sisters
have a nice holiday.

Thank you.
Bye, now.

Bye.
Oh...

Happy Thanksgiving.

Happy Thanksgiving to you.

Take care.
Thank you. Bye!

La, la, la...
So should we get a cab?

No, let's take
the shuttle.

A cab will be faster.

I'm not exactly
in a hurry...sis.


I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Come on, sweetie.

We gotta go upstairs.

We are so late.

Oh, God! There's
your grandmama.

Hi, grandma!

Come over here, girl, and
give your grandmama some sugar.

You've gotten so big!

Hi, Grace.

You're so skinny.
Ain't you been eating?

I eat.

Is Ronnie in the car?

Well, no. He's so sorry, but
he got caught up at work.

Oh...And Michael?

Michael is so busy
at college,

he probably won't be able
to come this weekend.

What do you mean he may not
be able to come this weekend?

It's Thanksgiving!

What do you have
in here? Goodness!

Well, I wanted to make sure
I had enough clothes.

Tony: Wait till you see this,
mom. Come check this out!

Sofia: My feet
are killing me.

Tony: Sorry.

Hey, Gordito.

23 pounds. I'm talking about
some fat sandwiches for me.

Hey, Gordo, come here.

Are you sure one will
be big enough?

Yeah, definitely.

I suppose so without
your father here.

Actually, without
your father here,

we'll probably
have leftovers

for the first time.

Hey, Joey!

Hi, Mrs. Avila!

Dad, this is
my teacher.

Hi.

Hello.

Oh, it's nice to meet you.

How do you like
the neighborhood?

Your signal's still on.

Huh?

Your signal's on!

I know.

And why am I not going
to get to see Michael?

Well, maybe we'll come
out over Christmas.

Yeah! Can we, mommy? Can we
go see grandma in Chicago?

If I had a dollar for
every time Ronald said

y'all was comin',
I'd be as rich as Oprah.

Ah...

Hi.
Hi.

Hi, mom.

Come here.
Oh, look at you!

Let me look at you.

Good to see you.

Hi, nice to see you again.

Hi.

We could have picked you up
at the airport.

Hi, really good
to see you.

Say hello to Marty.

Hi, Marty.

So Michael couldn't come

for just a little while
tomorrow?

You want something
to drink?

Oh, sure.

Your brother got me a
brand-new cappuccino maker,

and it makes, it makes
the puffy...The foam

is really great. The milk
foam's really great.

Do you want some cookies?

How about a mallomar?

Herb: It's Rachel's
room.

All right.

[Speaking Vietnamese]

It would be so nice
to see you tomorrow.

Hi.
Hey.

I am so tired.

Jenny.

Come in here.

Jenny: What?

What's wrong?

Where have you been?

Studying.


Why do you have this?

They gave them
out at school.

At school?

Why do schools
give my daughter this?

The nurses give
them to everybody.

I don't have any
use for them.

Look at yourself.

All right, Jenny,
go to your room.

No sense of modesty.

Well, look,
ask the school

if you don't
believe me!

Go to your room! Now!

I swear, you never
listen to me.

Did I really raise this?

Fine.

Is it a drug?

No! No! No!

Listen, listen to me.

Listen to me, and really
hear me this time.

He left.

And as hard
as it is for you,

it's better this way.

I like it like this.

Well, it's too late,
because I've asked him now.

No. No.

You're just going
to have to un-ask him.

Un-ask him. That's it!

How--

Don't!

Did you enjoy
it, Carla?

Oh, it was wonderful.
Thank you very much.

You're welcome.

Do you cook much?

You know, I...I don't
have much time to cook,

and besides, Rachel never
lets me in the kitchen.

Oh, now Art's
wife, Sarah...

She's a really
great cook.

But, you know, she,
with the twins

and everything, she
doesn't get to cook much.

Oh, they must be
getting so big.

Aw, they're great.
They're great.

Hannah, she eats two 
mashed bananas at a time.

And Jessie,
I swear to God,

yesterday she said,
"I love you, grandpa.

"I love you." She
doesn't say "grandpa,"

she says "brandpa."
"I love you, brandpa."

She's too young
to talk.

But he buys them
toys wherever we go.

Oh.

I mean, art's afraid
he's going to spoil them.

It's nice.

It's nice the way
you fuss over them.

They come, every
Tuesday they come,

and by the time
they leave,

I'm completely
exhausted.

I'm on my back.

You should see your father
in the garden with them.

Oh, he's 20 years younger.

Rachel, you should

spend some more time
with the twins.

You're going to miss
them growing up.

Aw, it's the best time,
it's the best time.

Here, let me take that.

We'll go in
the living room.

Oh, by the way,
Sarah gave me

a recipe from her
brother Jerry.

Yeah, Marty, boy.
It's my Marty!

You know, the tall
vegetarian one.

I'm making
roast polenta.

You want some
cake, girls?

Coffee, Herb?

I'll have a coffee.

Oh, my God. That dog

is going to get
so fat.

Is that my baby boy?

Is that my mama?

Oh, honey! It's
so good to see you.

How you doing?

Great.

Oh! Oh!

I come all this way,
and you can't even

pick up your own
mama at the airport.

I'm sorry, mama.

I've just been
swamped with work.

Well, I see you
living all right.

You got your
daddy's belly on you.

Oh, boy. I got no time
to work it off.

Um, listen. Is everything
all right with Audrey?

She's been putting
all those labels

on all those bowls
for tomorrow.

Now, I may be wrong,
but something

just don't seem
quite right, son.

Everything's
all right, mama.

We've just been
working hard.

We need a break.

And why isn't
Michael coming?

Now, his grandma
ain't gonna be around

too much longer.

And I don't know
how many trips to L.A.

I got in me.

Don't be crazy, mama.

You're just
getting started.

You should get
some sleep.

You've got
to be tired.

Go ahead
and get some rest.

Then good night,
Ronald.

Good night, mama.

I can't believe we
still have to do this

every time we come.

I like it.
It makes me feel like

I'm doing
something naughty.

Oh, God.

Hey, honey-pie...

Oh, my God.

Can we talk about
what this "disco sucks"

T-shirt means?

Oh, my gosh,
do I look awful?

No, you look gorgeous,
but who's the slut?

That's Amy.

I was 12.

She was a little whore.

We must have done
something wrong.

Oh, don't be
ridiculous, Herb.


Maybe it was that
kibbutz we sent her to.

With all the girls...

Is anything
wrong, honey?

Oh, sweetie.

They're doing their
best, you know?

Maybe they don't even
think about it anymore.

Both: Yeah, they do.

They think about it
all the time.

Now, honey, what
if they separate?

I think the house
is in Carla's name.

Why doesn't Jimmy want
to come home anymore?

For what?

What's happening
to my children

in this country?

Jimmy doesn't want
to come home.

Gary gets thrown
out of school.

My daughter
is disrespectful.

And Joey will grow up
just the same.

Why do you want
to make the turkey

taste like everything
else we eat?

Why do you want
everything

to taste
like McDonald's?

Get the door, Jenny.
Get the oven door.

OK, OK.

Whoa.

Oy. Turkey,
turkey, turkey.

Get that dog
away from here.

Go, go, go.

Oh, it's beautiful.

Take the vegetables
and you put them

right into roast.

Mm-hmm.

And you use your
hands like that?

Use your hands.
Get your hands dirty.

Why not? That's
half the fun of it.

Because this--

My nails.

This makes the
gravy incredible.

Tony? Come here
and help me

get this turkey
in the oven

before Abuela
gets here.

Good morning,
Grace.

Good morning.

Did you sleep OK?

Oh! Oh, yes,
I slept fine.

Well, that's it.
It's ready to go in.

You sure that's
big enough?

Mm-hmm.

When the kids
were growing up,

we used to get
three turkeys.

'Cause they'd
all be fighting

over the white meat.

How did you
ever manage?

Thanksgiving is the
easiest meal to make.

Just take that turkey,

throw it in the oven,

and the rest
will cook itself.

Excuse me.

Where's Ronnie?

He's where
he always is.

He's at work.

That's terrible!
It's Thanksgiving!

The governor
had a photo op

at the Hollywood
Presbyterian,

passing out turkey
dinners to the homeless.

He's at church?

Well, that's
all right then.

All right.

That's all right.

Got any whipped
cream for my coffee?

TV Commentator:
Right behind him,

it's Garfield!

Yeah.

Oh, Gary!
What a pig!

This is so disgusting.

Let's get this stuff.

Eww!

[Grandmother
speaking Vietnamese]

It's a cat.

Duc: Oh, Jenny.
Can you, uh...

Open up the store?

I'll be along in
a little while.

It won't be busy.

TV Commentator:
Oh! Oh!

Here we have our big
caterpillar coming up.

I believe he's about
55 feet long.

That's one of the
biggest balloon

in the parade,
I understand.

What's with you?
Where the hell--

Ruth: Shhh!

Where the hell
you going?

Ruth! Ruth!

They can come out
for breakfast!

Herbie, please.

Shhh.

Ruth: Rachel, honey.

Coffee.

Rachel,
it's your mom.

Oh, forget it.
Get back.

Get back here.
It's OK.

Ohhh.

Come in, mom.

Hi.

Hi.

Um, I--I brought you
some cappuccinos.

Thanks.

And, um, the turkey's
almost ready

to go in the oven.
OK?

OK.

Oy.

Oh...God,

I can't believe that.

I know.

I'm in the crack again.

All night I was
in the crack.


Well, what--
what do you expect?

Please, Herbie,
please.

What are you doing?
They could've had

breakfast out here.

Please, just eat
your bagel, would ya?

[Loud chatter]


Don't worry,
don't worry.

Voice inside:
Go Pittsburgh!

That's a nice
looking tree.

I know.

She's really
into gardening.

Oh, baby!

Oh!

Oh! [Kiss]
Let me look at you.

Mama,
this is Jimmy.

Hello, hello.
Welcome.

Oh, it's good to
finally meet you.

Come in, come in!

Welcome to
the testosterone club.

Anthony,
get over here.

How's my little sister?

Damn. What are you
eating at Berkeley?

You're getting
heavy.

Shut up, Tony.
Tony, Jimmy.

Jimmy, Tony.

Hey, Jimmy,
how you doing?

Elizabeth:
Come on in.

Abuela's here. She just
came in the door

and went
right to the kitchen.

Hey, is that
Gina's boyfriend?

Yeah, why?

I didn't know he was
gonna be Chinese and shit.

Neither did I.

Now shut up
and watch the game.

Gina:
Come, here, baby!

You know you have to

bring her back
though, right?

Bye, Maria!

And then I put
the pepper...

Heh heh heh!

Jimmy, can I get you
something to drink?

Water would be great.

Oh, mama,
sit down.

I'll get it.
Here, take her.

Oh, don't worry,
don't worry.


[Women cooing]

So where are
you from, Jimmy?

Uh, I was born
in Vietnam.

Oh, no, that's
not what I mean.

I mean, Gina told me

that your family
lives in L.A.

Oh, yeah. They live
in Westminster.

Ah.

Hey, would you two
like to take a nap

or a shower or something?
Freshen up?

Oh, bring the baby back.

Ok, and then get Jimmy

a couple of towels,
all right?

Get the nice ones!

Thank you,
Mrs. Avila.

Hi, I need
to talk to you.

No, no, no, no.

No, I'm not,
I'm not.

Um, just--
just come soon, OK?


What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

Your cousins
and mom are outside.

They're busy.

Listen,
listen to me.

[Knock at door]

Gina?

I knew it.
I trusted you.

Would either of you

like something
to eat?

Jimmy: Uh, that's--

That's OK, Mrs. Avila.

We had some bagels
on the way down here.

Ok, well,

just let me know

if you need
anything.


That was funny.

Not as funny
as this!

You know, they haven't
spoken in over a year?

It's terrible.
That's it, Carla.

Just make sure
it goes

all the way
in the back.

Mmm, that's
my favorite part.

I mean, our
only grandson

not circumcised yet.

It's a shanda.

A-and they spoke
to that moyel

in Beverly Hills
about the bris

and everything.

But it's up
to his parents.

No, no, it's tradition.

Yeah, you
invited them

because you feel
sorry for them.

I invited them

because everyone
who lives

in that
retirement home

has no place to go
during the holidays,

and so we couldn't
do that to them.

Still,
you should not

be talking
to their kids.

Oh, well, your father's
side of the family

have never ever been
good listeners.

All right, Carla?

Could you please
get the oven?

Sure.

All right,
let's put it in.

Here we go.

All right,
on 1, 2, 3.

Ok, I got it.

Oh, my God,
it's heavy.

It's very hot.

Easy!

Oy, oy, oy.

There we go.

Looks pretty,
huh?

It's about, uh...

It's about
100 degrees now.

I like to usually
keep it

around 104, 105.

We have a jacuzzi
at my gym, but I never--

I go in
every night. I--

It's good
for the circulation,

but you can't
stay in too long

because
it's not good

for the kidneys.

You know
Michael Landon

from, uh,
from Bonanza?

Uh-huh?

He was Jewish.

The whole Cartwright
family was Jewish.

Oyster and shiitake
mushroom dressing?

Hmm. Never heard
of that before.

These friends
of yours...

Don't they
have families

to be with today?

James' parents
are passed on, OK?

Paula's family
is in Montana.

Well, isn't Michael
gonna at least call?

Or do you just
talk to each other

on the e-mail now?

We'll call him
in a while.

Mommy, when the Turkey
gonna be ready?

It's almost done.
What are you doing?

You know, I could
whip up a batch

of macaroni
and cheese.

You know,
every once in a while

it's good to try
something brand new.

Well...

I hope you put
enough cinnamon

on that
apple pie.

Ronald: Mm-mmm!

Something really
smells good

coming out
of that kitchen.

Daddy's home, grandma.

Hi, daddy.

That's it, ladies.
You got me

for the rest
of the weekend.

Hi, darling.

Hello,
baby, baby.

Daddy, I helped grandma
peel the potatoes.

Excuse me, you need
to get ready.

I gotta go.

Well, I hope

you're not
expecting

cornbread
stuffing

and macaroni
and cheese.

You know whatever
you ladies come up with

will be fine with me.

Yeah, shiitake
mushroom dressing

or something
like that.

I cannot
do this.

What's wrong, honey?

I cannot do this
all alone.

Look, I'm sorry.
The photo shoot went over.

She keeps going on
and on about Michael.

I'm running out
of things to say to her.

Well, what do you
want me to do, Audrey?

Well, it's your fault
he's not coming, Ronald.

What can I do?

Your mother thinks
you shit ice cream.

Yeah.

No.

Look, baby--

What?

I resent you putting
me in this position.

I resent it,

and today I'm really
feeling it.

Look, I will
take care of my mother

from here on out, OK?

I will tell her
something.

Come on, come on,
this is Thanksgiving.

We'll get through this.

OK?

Look,
just hang in there.

I'm gonna go get changed.
I'll be right back.

[Wipeout playing]

There we go.

Audrey: Watch this.
Look at this.

No, Gordo!

Grace: You loved it
when you were

a little boy,
I'll tell you.

Ow!

Jimmy: Mrs. Avila,
do you mean up here?

Yeah, the ones
in the back.

Uh, those.
Thank you, sweetheart.

[Women laughing]

It's true.
It's true.

Thank you,
Jimmy.

Oh, you!

Get out
of my kitchen!

You guys
want a beer?

You better not
be a 49ers fan.

No, no, no!
He was out.

It's incomplete.
He was out!

Watch! It was
incomplete.

Come here
for sec.

No, no, no, no.

Watch, right now,
right now.

See? Yes, told you!

Yes, yes, look it!

No, no, no no!

Ha ha ha!

What's up?

Tell me
the truth, Tony.

How's mom been?

She seems fine.

Yeah, but do you
think she's OK?

Well, she looks

a lot better
than dad.

You saw dad?

Yesterday
at the supermarket.

He looks like shit.

It's over
with auntie Rosa.

He knows
he screwed up,

all right, Gina?

Yeah, well, screwing up
is one thing,

but not with
your wife's cousin.

I mean, that shit's
beyond screwed up, Tony.

Well, I kind of
invited him

over today.

What?!

You know, it's over,

and he has
no place to go,

so I thought--

How could you be
so stupid, Tony?

Hey, mom's already
freaked out

and yelled
at me, OK?

Well, did you tell him
not to come?

Yeah.

I left a message
on his machine.

OK? Happy?

[Men arguing]

Carla:
Good. Good!

Yeah, Rachel
sends her love.

No, it's beautiful
and sunny here.

What? It's
already snowing?

How's the leg, mom?

Ok, just don't
overdo it.

It's nice she gets on
so well with her mother.

Oh, she's lovely.

We don't get
to see her enough,

but I'd really
like you

to meet her someday.

You know...

All my life

all I ever wanted
for you was...

To be happy.

To meet somebody special

and--and just
have a family.

Oh, mom, I am happy.

Carla makes me
very, very happy.

James:
Wait a minute.

Come on, Monica.

I am coming!

Don't talk to Paula
like that.

Hi, Audrey,
happy Thanksgiving.

You remember
Monica, don't you?

Yes, hi, Monica.

Sorry, Audrey.

We would've
told you sooner,

but Monica
just arrived.

Oh, nonsense!
Monica, welcome.

Your father
doesn't bring you

often enough.

He mother dropped her
off this morning.

They had another
falling out.

She has been
a pain in the ass.

She can sit next to
my mother-in-law.

Presenting
seÃ±or turkey!

All: Ooh!

Is it cooked?

Looks good
to me.

Eh, could go
back in, maybe.

Let's be on
the safe side.

Let me baste it again.
We'll put it back in

just for
a few minutes.

Anthony: You want
another beer?

Jimmy: No,
that's it.

So, do you have
a big family?

I have, you know,
two little brothers

and a sister.

My grandparents
live with us, too.

Yeah?

Are you guys tight?

Yeah.

Should we go inside
and give 'em a hand?

Yeah.

Do you like
Jackie Chan?

Yeah, sure.

That boy
is hell of a crazy,

jumping off
of helicopters, buses,

hanging from poles.

Yeah,
he's pretty bad.

Yeah, but he's
not as bad as Bruce.

Bruce Lee
is the baddest.

Right?

Yeah?

No one
can touch Bruce.

Uh-uh.

Sophie!

Sweetie, can I
have another beer?

Sophie: Why don't you
get it yourself?

You tell Audrey
about Michael?

No.

She worries about
him enough as it is.

She's still mad,
then?

It's gettin' better.

Yeah?

Just wish Michael
would grow up, though.



You know Michael's
not coming?

I was afraid to ask.

They're still
not speaking, huh?

No.

Well, I guess you can't
call yourself a family

if someone isn't
speaking to someone else.

Ha.

Do you want to play
Thanksgiving with us?

I can't think of anything
I'd rather do less.

Now you be the mommy,
and I'll be the daddy.

Wow. This is sick.

You guys are really
twisted, you know that?

Grace: Kristen.

What are y'all
playin', honey?

Play with us,
grandma.

We're playing
Thanksgiving.

Oh, how nice.

Yeah.
She's the mommy,

she's the daddy,

and I'm the alcoholic,
cult-worshipping,

Satanic stepmother.

Oh.

[Door opens]

Mmm. Hi.

Hi.

Are you OK?

Well, I made it
through your dad's

dissertation
on hot tubs.

Oh.

Ha ha ha.

Mom sends her best.
How are you doing?

I almost told her.

What happened?

She burst into tears
about something.

She doesn't want my aunt
and uncle to know about us.

The uncle who's
having the affair

with the mistress.

Yes.

Oh, God.

Mmm.

Please, don't--
don't let them

pull you
into an argument

and don't sit
next to my Uncle David,

because he doesn't
chew his food properly,

and it drips all down his...
It's disgusting.

[Doorbell rings]

Show time.

You'll be fine.

We'll have fun.

OK.
Come on.

Woman: Oh, hi!

Rach, come on.

Come on.

Woman: It's
good to see you.

Herb:
How was the traffic?

Was the traffic bad,
or...

OK.

I know you like
my kishke.

Hi.

Oh, Rachel, honey.

You look great.

Oh, thank you.

Doesn't she
look beautiful?

Just like
a movie star.

Thank you.

Good
to see you.

Hello.

Is this
your roommate?

This is Carla,
yeah.

Oh, Carla.
Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet
you, too.

Ha ha ha!

I'll take this.

Why don't you have
a little nosh?

David,
take off your hat.

Now, listen.

I have someone
coming over...

Just for dessert,
a friend,

so I need you to set
a place right next to me.

OK, good.
Who is she?

He. His name
is Daniel.

All right, mama.

When did
this happen?

How long have you
been hiding this?

I've known him
for a couple of years.

He's a teacher
at the school.

[Doorbell rings]

Excuse me. The door.

[All greeting each other]

Yeah.

You got her?

Yeah.

Ok, Jerry, can you
get the door?

Ok.


You're gonna go see
your grandpa and grandma.

Ooh, we're
very excited.

Your first
Thanksgiving.

And lots of food.

And your aunt,

and your aunt's
friend. Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Oh, that's my girls!

Oh! Ho ho ho!

Look at this
little girl.

Hi.

Look at her.

[Baby cries]

Oh, ho ho.
You scared her, David.

You scared her.

Come here, sweetheart.

[All talking]

Ruth: Everybody, this is
Sarah's brother Jerry.

How are you?

I'll get some
more chairs.

David, you're
scaring her.

You're scaring her.

Your face
is very frightening...

Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!
To a little kid.

My mom
has a boyfriend.

How am I supposed
to talk to him?

Like normal. Just...

Just be normal.

What would you do

if your mom
got a new boyfriend?

Ha ha ha ha!

It could happen.

Yeah.
You never know.

Right now my mom
will be cooking two meals--

one for my grandparents,
and one for the kids.

You know, you can
go over for dessert.

I'd rather be with you.

Well, I can
go with you.

I could be a friend

who gave you
a ride down.

I can't be myself
with them.

Gina, sweetheart.

Would you go and
get me some more butter?

'Cause I used all of it
on the mashed potatoes,

and on the way,
would you return this?

It's probably
closed, mom.

Just put it
in the slot.

Thanks, bye.

[Shop bell jingles]

Jenny, what's wrong?

Come here.

Jenny, what's wrong?
Come on.

I got a million
things to do.

What's wrong?


What?

What's wrong?
Come on.

You're freakin'
me out.

What's wrong?

What?

Here. Open this.

Gently, gently.

Be careful.

Holy shit!

What are you
doin' with a gun?

It's not mine!

I found it under
my brother's bed, OK?

I don't know
what to do.

Jen, Jen.

Don't!
Don't touch it.

It's too hot, ma.

I'll do it.

Check the salad,
please.

Duc, can you
get Jenny?

We need some help in
the kitchen, yeah?

[Telephone rings]

Duc: OK.
Hey, touchdown?

Hello?

Is Gary there?

I'm coming
to close the store.

Your mom needs you
in the kitchen.

Can you please
get Gary for me?

Gary.

Yeah.
Jenny.

Why?

I don't know.

Yeah, what's up?

Gary, I found
something in your room.

What are you
talking about?

Why do you
have a gun, Gary?

What'd you do with it?

It's not mine,
all right?

I'm just lookin'
after it for somebody.

Have you used it?

Look, I told--

I told you
it's not mine.

You better not
say nothin', Jen.

I'm gonna have to
give it back.

Trinh: Can you
get Jenny, please?

Yeah.

Look, mom wants you.

Don't screw around,
Jenny. All right?

Now, I'm gonna come
over and get this.

Hurry up.

All right.

Come here. What, what,
what, what, what, what?

Oh, shit. Dad.

Duc: Stop it now!
You, please.

Jenny, get in the car!
Come on!

Let's go! Outside!

Jenny: Wait! Wait!

What do you think
you're doing?

Come on,
get in the car!

Hurry up! Hurry up!

Duc: Get in the car!

Jenny: I don't
want to go with you.

Jenny, I said
get in the car now!

No!

You, get out
of here right now.

Boy: I want
to talk to you.

Duc: Get in the car.

Get in the car.
Let's go.

You don't understand.
We're not doing anything.

I don't care.
Do what I say.

Get in the car! Now!

No! Get away from me!

You! Get away from here,
or I'll call the police!

Jen, just tell him, OK?

Stay away from us!

Just tell him.

She was
with a white guy?

I told you, she
was with some guy.

She looked like
she had been crying.

Did she look like
she was in trouble?

No. She probably
just got in a fight

with her boyfriend
or something.

Boyfriend?

Who is he?!

Who was he, Jenny?

Look,
it doesn't matter!

You shouldn't
have thrown him out!

Don't you under--

Is that why
you have condoms?

Is that why your daughter
have condoms?

Unh!

So you can sleep
with everybody?

You are a shame,
you know.

You don't know
how good I am!

I don't know what?

You don't know
what--

[Screaming
incoherently]

Is that how you
repay your family?!

Huh? You ungrateful
beast, you.


You ungrateful--

Is that how
you give thanks, huh?

You don't
understand!

I don't understand?

What I don't understand?

Now what don't I understand?

You don't
understand me!

You don't
understand anything.

You never
listen to me!

OK. All right.

All right.
It's finished for now.

It's finished for now.
You go.

Finished for now!
Fine!

[Slams door]

We don't know anything
about our children.

We don't know anything
about our children.

It's all right.

[Knock on door]

[Grandmother
speaking Vietnamese]

[Door opens]

Jenny, Jenny,
come on.

[Speaking Vietnamese]

You don't understand,
grandma.


No, I'm not eating.

Well, then why don't
they tell me that?

All they ever
talk about is Jimmy.

Bea and David sort of
fouled things up today.

Me, too.

There's
always Hanukkah.

So, um, how have they
been with you two?

Well, mom brought us
cappuccinos

in bed this morning.

[Telephone rings]


Gary: I got it.

I got it.

Hello.

Hey, Jimmy.
How are you?

It's Jimmy.

Is everything all right?

Fine. Listen, how's
everything at school?

Everything's good.

I was just thinking
about you guys is all.

Um, I'm sorry I couldn't
come home today.

School's just been crazy.

Oh, you're
a good boy, Jimmy.

Listen, your mom
wants to talk to you.

Jimmy.

Mom, hey.
Happy Thanksgiving.

Oh, Jimmy, you have
to talk to Jenny.

She has disgraced
the family.

What's going on?

Jimmy...

Do they give condoms
out to girls?

Herb: Gordo, no!

I don't know, mom.
Let me talk to her.

Trinh: Jenny! Jenny!

Jimmy wants
to talk to you.

You see? She doesn't
listen to us.

You have to
talk to her.

[Smoke alarm beeping]

Oh, my God!

Mom. Ma.

Hi, Jimmy.
Happy Thanksgiving.

Joey, let me
talk to mom.

Joey!

[Speaking Vietnamese]

It's too hot.

Isn't that gorgeous?

Yes, it's stunning.

Just let's get it
out of the oven.

Clear me a space.

God, it's beautiful.

I think that needs
a little more time, honey.

Oh, it's done.

The thermometer
says it's done.

It might say that,

but I can tell
it ain't ready.

Uh...Grace,
it's done.

Don't poke
my turkey.

It's still pink.

That's not done.

It's--it's
turkey.

It's supposed
to be pink.

People get ill
that way.

Grace, I've been
cookin' the turkey

for 20 years.

I think I know when
the turkey's done.


I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

Ok, well,
it's all right.

You do it your way.

Just put my helping
in the microwave.

Oh...My God.

Huh? See how
that cuts?

Man: Get over here.
Get over here!

Your children broke
a plate on the patio.

Jose, if you run,
it's gonna be worse.

[Doorbell rings]

I'll get it.

Javier: Hola, Gina.

Happy Thanksgiving.

[Speaking Spanish]

Man: Hey, bro.

Mom, I left a message.
I swear.

I just wanted us
all to be together.

That's all.

I brought you these.

Thank you.

Gordito. [Kissing]

[Speaking Spanish]

Gordito, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡?

Hey, Mrs. Williams.

Here. Sit down.

I've been kicked out
of the kitchen.

I guess
I can't keep up.

She's taking
the turkey's temperature.

Well, join us out here.

It's a beautiful day.

Can I get you something
to drink, mom?

I'll get it.

I should check in
inside, anyway.

What can I get for you,
Mrs. Williams?

Nothing, thank you.

Thanks, James.

Your wife
yelled at me.

[Sliding door closes]

Lighten up on
Audrey, all right?

She's under
a lot of stress.

Please don't do that

in front
of the company.

Friends are one thing.

When's the last time
y'all saw any family?

Talkin' on computers.

That ain't
the same thing.

Oh, mama,
let's not start, ok?

He's comin' back.

Are you
embarrassed by us?

All my life I had to
put up with white people

lookin' at me funny,

and now my own son's gonna
do the same thing, too?

Oh, mama, please
don't be crazy.

I mean, I've
just been busy.

That's all.

Maybe if you spent
more time with our family,

Michael would think he was
part of something bigger.

I got it.
I got it.

You got it?
Oh, Audrey.

Oh, Audrey,
it's so beautiful.

It's just perfect.

Gorgeous!

It's nothing.

Are those
yams Diana?

Yes!

Incredible.
Look at this woman.

Hey, come on,
you guys.

Oh, the stuffing
has oysters in it.

I'm gonna die.

James: Delicious!

Look at this
fruit compote.

This woman, truly...

Can you get over how
gorgeous this is?

Excuse me, sweetie.

Dad, you know I'm
a vegetarian, right?

Monica, why didn't you
say something before?

We have plenty
of veggies.

Yes, that's right.
You'll be fine.

Take
your places.

James, Paula,
Monica--

Aah! Aah!

Paula: No, no,
no. It's OK.

Sweetie, it's
gonna be OK.

Move this. Get this
out of the way.

It's OK. It didn't
hit the floor.

Easy, easy.

Oh, my God. Aah!

It'll be ok, hon.
It'll be OK.

I got it.
I got it.

You can rinse 'em.

Here we go.

We can rinse it.

The bird didn't hit.

I got it.
I got it.

Here, you little ones,
come here.

Take this bread.

Got it.

Take the bread for mommy.

Go find a plate
in the kitchen.

It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK.

Think we can
rinse 'em.

Paula: Monica, go with them.
Get us another plate.

Honey, look,
this turkey is fine.

Paula: You know what?
It's fine.

It's just gonna be fine.

Grace: It's
gonna be great.

What about
the vegetables?

We can
rinse 'em.

Paula: That's all right.
We've got...

Ronald: The bird is safe.

James: We're OK.

Monica: Dad, dad.

What?

Here, sweetie.
Take this for mom.

Very careful,
to the kitchen.

Ugh!

Paula: Give your mommy
a hug, you.

Yeah.

Somebody get
a clean plate.

Grace:
We can rinse 'em.

We can rinse 'em.
It's still good.

It's still good.

The turkey's great.

The turkey didn't
even hit the floor.

Happy Thanksgiving,
sweetheart.

Oh, don't be funny.

All right. All right.

What are we missing?

I've got more
cranberries.

I've got more
cranberries.

You're not gonna
do another thing.

It's fine. We're
gonna clean this up.

Everybody
just calm down.

Aah!

Just calm down.
It's OK.

Just be grateful
we have...

Here it is, everyone.

All: Ooh, ah!

I made this dish
especially for Jerry.

Nice.

All: Ooh!

Man: That looks good.

Wow. Doesn't
that look delicious?

Oh, Gina.

Audrey, we've lost
a little in presentation,

but it's gonna
be delicious,

absolutely.

â™ª Uh-huh,
oh, yeah â™ª

Kentucky
Fried Chicken!

â™ª Uh-huh,
uh-huh â™ª

â™ª Uh-huh,
uh-huh â™ª

Whoo!

Dear God, thank you for
bringing us all together

on this
very special day...

And for allowing
our children to be happy

in whatever way
they choose to be.

We ask that others

be as understanding

and as tolerant
as you are.

And for the food

we're about
to receive.

We thank you
for allowing us

to come together
today.

And for
our happiness.

I am thankful that the spirit
of my late husband

could be here with us today
to celebrate your goodness.

[Cell phone music]

Audrey: Uh,
no, don't, please.

It's the same
at our house.

Grace, go ahead.

I'm thankful
for our happiness.

I'm thankful for the food
we're about to receive.

Joey: And we pray for
a whole future progress,

Harmony, and allow us, so
that we can all get along,

and please help
the Raiders win the game

so they can
make the playoffs,

and please give me
some Christmas presents,

like a telescope,

and please watch over
my brother Jimmy in college.

Amen.

Amen.

All: Amen.

Ruth: Let's eat!

Abuela,
the tamales....

Adrian, give me some
dark meat.

You know, Audrey, this
shiitake mushroom stuffing is--

It's different.

[Overlapping chatter]

Hey, Audrey, is there
any animal fat in here?

Audrey: Oh, no.
Not at all.

That's Moroccan
fruit compote.

That's fruit.
It would be kind of

out of place
in a fruit compote.

Oh, OK.

I need some bread.

Audrey: Do you
do cheese, Monica?

I like the little Chinese
chicken salad this year.

Nice touch.

Herb: What are we
having for dessert?

[All laugh]

Mom, thank you very much.
It's delicious.

Mmm. Very good, Lizzy.
Delicious.

To all the women
in my life, thank you.

Can I please
have some bread?

Ronald: Very good.

James: This stuffing's
delicious.

Now, that little tragedy
seems like it happened

last year, doesn't it?
Everything is just perfect.

Gary: How's
the chicken, Joey?

Really good.

Audrey: Do you
like the bread?

My favorite part
about Thanksgiving

is knowing I can
eat this tomorrow.

Hush up, everybody.
Hush. Hush. Everybody.

I know this is an
old-fashioned tradition,

but my late husband
always insisted

that we go
around the table

and say the one thing
we're thankful for.

I remember this.

Audrey, you're first, OK?

Well, let's see--

[Doorbell rings]

Who could that be?
Huh?

Are we thankful
for this?

It could be the governor.

Yeah. He can't get the
paint out of his hair.

If he can't
get you on the phone,

he gets in his car.
He's done it before.

Paula: No. I'm not joking.
I won't tell you when.


Ronald: Honey.

Kristen: It's Michael!

My God, you came!
My sweetie. [Laughs]

Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone.

[Audrey laughs]

Hey, how's
my baby sister?

How you doing?
You're getting so heavy.

Look at you.

Michael: Hey, grandma.

Oh, hi, honey. It's
so good to see you. Oh!

Oh, great. Ronnie,
get him another chair.

I want
my handsome grandson

sitting right here
next to me.

There's a chair
right there.

Grace: I knew you weren't
gonna let me go home

without seeing you.

Michael: You know that.


Michael, you remember
Paula, James.

Audrey: This is Monica,
James' daughter.

How you doing?

Here you are, sweetie.

Thank you, mom.

Give him plenty
of turkey.

This boy looks
like he needs

a little
home cooking.

You're crazy.

Dark meat.

So you changed your mind?

You should've called.
Let us know you were coming.

Nonsense. Ronald, he doesn't
need to call to come home.

[Chuckles quietly]

Would you like some
macaroni and cheese?

Grandma, you made
the macaroni and cheese?

Yeah, baby.
Yeah.

Michael: Looks good.

This is Moroccan fruit
compote, sweetie. Oops. Ha!

Thanks, ma.

Ah, it is good.

I knew you made it,
grandma.

Yeah.

[Javier speaking Spanish]

Javier: Jimmy.

[Imitates Bruce Lee]

Hey, Julio Lee.


You know who
that was, right?

You know who
I'm doing, right?

That's pretty good.

Yeah.


Here's to Bruce.

Yeah.


Sarah, can I help you
with the baby?

We're fine.

All right, everybody.
Here. Take seconds.

Ruth: Don't be shy.

I want to know
everything about you.

Where were you born?

And then, where were
you living after that?

And don't you just
love Los Angeles?

Um, is this
your first time?

No. Actually, I've
been here once before.

I like it. I just don't
think I could live here.

Everything's
so spread out.

It used to be
in L.A.,

everything was
20 minutes away.

Now it's 24-hours-
a-day traffic.

Must be really hard
to meet people.

People don't even know
who their neighbors are.

Well, how did you and
Rachel become roommates?

Are you school friends?

Carla: Uh, no.
We met at work.

Yeah. Carla started
with the company

3 weeks before I did.

She actually owns
the house that we live in.

Oh.

Jerry--

So you also work in
the San Francisco area?

Mm-hmm.

Jerry, did you
enjoy the polenta?

It's delicious.
Thanks.

Why don't you
have some more?

I'll take some more.
That'd be great.

Is that what that is?
I thought it was jell-o.

Ruth: Bea.


It kind of looks
like Jell-o.

Herb: Bea...
Ha ha ha.

And, Paula,
now it's your turn.

Oh, well, I guess
I'm most thankful

that we're all healthy--

Hear, hear.

That nothing terrible
has happened to any of us,

and that we have good
friends who invited us over,

so I didn't have to spend
the last three days cooking.

[All laugh]

Ronnie?

Well, I'm thankful

for having the best
mother and wife

and children
in the world.

Grace: Michael?

I'm just glad to be home.

Grace: And--

Monica: Monica.

You're last.

I'd like to thank
our fellow Native Americans

who gave us this land
in exchange for measles,

reservations, and casinos,

so we could have all this
food to celebrate it with.

Monica, please.

More like thanks-taking,
don't you think?

OK. Very good.

Paula: OK.

So, Michael, what have
you been up to lately?

I'm keeping busy.

He's my first grandson
to go to college, you know.

Uh, grandma. Um,
I'm taking some time off.

Grace: What? You quit?

No. I didn't quit.

Why didn't somebody
tell me?

Grace, a lot of kids
take the semester off

to decide
what they want to do.

Well, I thought you
were doing so well.

I am.

Ronald: Well,
you did register

for the spring
semester, right?

Dad, you know
I'm not going back.

Honey, you're taking
time off, and that's OK.

Ronald: You know,
UC Santa Barbara

has a well-respected
business school.

Dad, there's
no black people there.

You tell me what you're
gonna do with a degree

in African-American
studies, young man. Hmm?

Ronald.

Ronald: What?

Can we talk
about it later?

So, Ronald, did you watch
the news last night?

All three stations led
with the paint thing.

I have strict
orders from my wife

not to talk
about work.

He deserves it.

Thank you, Monica.

So, Michael,

how do you feel about
the whole ebonics thing?


I like you.

I mean, why did they throw
paint on his nice suit?

Didn't Rhodes
grow up around here?

Sure he did. His father
used to own a store

around the corner
from us.

You know
what I like about him?

He says what he thinks,

and he doesn't care
what anybody else says.

Oh, come on, dad.

Bea: I was born
and raised in Fairfax,

and now, I'm afraid
to come home.

It was never
like that before.

His entire campaign was
playing on people's fears.

David: You know
what I think?

I think someone
should speak up

for the ordinary
people.

I mean,
there's a limit

to how many
foreigners

this country
can accommodate.

Um--

Don't.

Well, you know
what I like about him?

He's an honest man.

He's not like every
other politician.

They're all
exactly the same.

Some are just
a little more

dangerous
than others.

Now, if we don't have
some strong leadership

in this state,

it's gonna
collapse on itself.

You know what makes me mad?
The graffiti.

It makes everything
look so ugly. I just--

Dad, don't you think
he's a little extreme?

Herb: Well, he should
do whatever it takes

to stop what's going on.

I mean, there's so many
people on welfare now.

There's drugs, the gangs,
come on!

It's got to be stopped.

But he's a racist,
anti-gay bigot.

I didn't even ask Jimmy
what he was eating today.

I wonder if the cafeteria
would be open?

Elizabeth:
Thank you, sweetie.

So, Jimmy,
what's your family do?

They own a video store.

Oh. Have they met Gina yet?

I'm gonna meet
them at Christmas.

I remember when I met
your mother's family.

Remember, grandma?

I was so afraid of grandpa
that I couldn't eat,

and Lizzy,

she fixed me a little
care package to take home

so I wouldn't go to bed
without eating.

Remember that?

Mm-hmm.

[Grandma Avila
speaks Spanish]

If grandpa
were alive...

Lizzy, look.
That's over now, all right?

I made a big mistake.
That's all.

You're glad
I've come, right?

Javier,

it was Anthony who
invited you, not I.

He did it for us.

They want us
to be together now.

I miss you so much.

Could you take these out
before they get cold?

Sure.

You still take
my breath away.

[Doorbell rings]

Anthony: I'll get it.

Anthony: Hi.
Can I help you?

Daniel: Yeah.
Is Elizabeth here?

Anthony: Mom.

Hey.

Pies.

Thank you.

Would you take these
in the kitchen, please?

Feeling strong?

Yeah.

Good.

Elizabeth: Everyone,

I'd like you to meet Daniel.

Hi, everyone.

Elizabeth: Come.
Sit over here by me.

Daniel: Hi.

Elizabeth:
Come on over here.

Anthony, would you
bring a chair?

I need another cushion

for that awful,
awful orange chair.

Daniel: Thanks.

Elizabeth:
Will that be all right?

Daniel: Oh, it'll be fine.

Elizabeth: Oh! All right.

Is there any more wine
on the table?

No. Anthony, would you go
in and get some more wine

and also a glass
for Daniel? Thank you.

This is my son
Anthony.

Hey. How you doing, man?

And this is my
daughter Gina.

Hi, Gina.

And this is

my daughter's
boyfriend Jimmy.

And I'm Javier,
her husband. Who are you?

I'm a teacher at
Elizabeth's school.

Michael.
Hmm?

Please do not push
your father's buttons today.

No politics, all right?

All right.

So what are you
doing now, Michael?

I'm working as a teacher's
aide in Inglewood,

saving up to go to Howard.

Isn't that all
the way in D.C.?

Yep.

You think Howard's
gonna accept someone

who doesn't finish
what they start?

Why do you want to go

clear across the country
to isolate yourself

at an all-black school,
anyway?

Why are you always so
critical of anything black?

You're working for a man who
sold out affirmative action.

He is saying the same
thing that I am saying.

Do for yourself.

Don't expect anybody
else to do it for you.

Oh, come on, dad.

There's always been
preferential treatment.

It just depends on who you
know and where you come from.

See, what I'm talking
about here is access.

But you don't think
your mother and I

worked for all this?

I'll tell you this.

If it wasn't for
"affirmative action,"

you wouldn't have
your boy Colin Powell now,

now would you?

Michael, what
Mr. Rhodes is saying

has nothing to do
with being a black

or white or democrat
or republican.

It has to do

with taking
responsibility

for your own action.

Like the way
you walked out on mom?

Paula: Monica.

Well, it's true,
isn't it?

Monica, please.

This is not the time
or the place.

How could you be
such a hypocrite, dad?

Michael, don't talk to
your father like that.

No, no, no, no.
That's all right.

He's just got
no respect anymore.

Why don't you tell

everybody what you did
yesterday, Michael? Hmm?

If I wasn't there, you'd
be in jail right now.

Michael.

What did he do?

Oh, he was the one that threw
the paint on Governor Rhodes.

All right!

Monica, for
God's sake, please!

Michael, that's
not right, honey.

Your daddy works so hard
for all of you all.

Yeah? Well, ask him
why he's always working.

Michael,
that is enough.

Yeah.
Ask him who Lisa is.

What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

Excuse me.

Michael:
Mom, I'm sorry.

Ronald:
You happy now?

Mom, I am so sorry.

It's time
for dessert.

I shouldn't have
said that. I'm sorry.

Somebody,
please tell me.

Mom found out that dad had
been seeing a woman at work.

Oh, I knew you were keeping
something from me, honey.

It's over.

I just--oh, my Lord, honey.
You can't get a divorce.

The affair
is over.

Yeah, right.

Ron! Boy!

Mom, you don't
have to stay with him.

What is wrong with you?

Why you acting like this?
You're acting so weak.

Weak? Trying to hold this
family together is weak?

Sometimes I think it's
never the fucking shit

I have to put up with,

but you and Kristen mean
more to me than that.

Tell me how I'm weak.

Grace: Shame on you!

You're leaving.

I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, mom.

Just gonna eat?


Mrs. Williams.

Ronald Williams, how could
you have done this, son?

Mama, God knows

how sorry I am
for betraying them.

Sorry is one thing. How
you planning on fixing it?

I don't know.

I've been trying.

I know I've hurt
them very badly.

I mean, Michael's

already given up on
me, and I'm scared

Audrey's
gonna go next.

Think about why
she's still here.

Give her
that much respect.

Well, I must say,

Hannah and Jessica are
absolutely beautiful.

Thank you.

When is
the next one coming?

Well, we have
our hands full

till these two
are 18,

and then, it
doesn't even

stop there
with daughters,

does it, dad?

Yeah. Pass me
a toothpick,

will you, Artie?

Rachel, honey,

I can hear the clock
going tick-tock, tick-tock.

Meaning?

Bea: Meaning we're
all tired of waiting

for your Mr. Right
to come along.

Well, stranger
things have happened.

Bea, please stop
pestering her, please.

Bea: Rachel, honey, you look
a lot slimmer this year.

Is there someone
new in your life

that you're keeping from us?

Nope. Nobody new.

Well, maybe it would help if
you changed your hairstyle.

I got a little
turkey here.

I got a
little turkey.

Will you
stop interrupting me

so I can
give your daughter

some wonderful advice?

You've been wearing it
this way for years,

and it looks lovely,

but I think that you ought
to try something different,

maybe a little
more glamorous.

I really like it
like this.

Bea: You do? Oh.

Ruth: Oh, Bea.

Some more wine?

Sure. Why not?

Just keep pouring.

Artie: Here.
Take the bottle.

Thanks.

[Talking and laughing]

That should be
in the center,

and the fruit--
very good.

Don't want to
count no calories.


Mom, you didn't tell me
you invited someone.

Well, I did, and
I didn't want to

make a big deal
of it.

Well,
you should have--

It's OK. I'll leave.

Obviously,
I'm in the way here.

If this is too hard,
I don't mind--

No, no, no, no.
Daniel, please.

Javier,

Anthony
wants you here.

Everyone wants
you here.

Please stay.

Jimmy, what would you
like for dessert?

Would you like
some flan, some pie,

or some arroz con leche?

Flan, please.

Flan. Very good.

Doesn't that
look delicious?

Delores made that.

Daniel, what
would you like?

Uh, some pumpkin
would be great.

Pumpkin. Could we
have the pumpkin

down here, please?

Thank you.

That looks so pretty
with the flower.

Javier,
what would you like?

Hmm?

I want my wife
and children back.

Elizabeth: Javier,
this is not the time.

Would you like some pie?

How long have you
known my wife?

A few years.
A few years.

We've known each other
for a few years.

We work together
at the school.

Daniel has been for me
a... compadre.

What about me?

Dad, you're
the one who left.

Javier: No. She--

Rosa threw herself at
dad last Christmas, OK?

Oh, please, Anthony. Are you
really gonna bail on Sofia

if some slut
walks in right now?

He better not,

or I'm gonna cut
his huev off.

No, no, no, no.
It's not right,

my wife dating...
[Speaking Spanish]

Shut up, Javier!

Can't you see
she's happy now?

Dad!
Javier!

You see?

[Speaking Spanish]

Man, he's got
some nerve.

Anthony:
What are they saying?

She's gonna take him
back. She's got to.

No, she doesn't.

Elizabeth: Javier.

I'm so embarrassed.

I mean, you could have
told me somebody was coming.

Javier, I didn't know
you were coming.

I didn't
ask you to come.

Look. Look, I'm sorry.
Look, I didn't realize

what I was doing, OK?

I mean, it didn't
mean anything.

I should have
never left, ok?

Look, Javier.

What do you
want me to do, hmm?

What do you
expect me to do?

The whole time
you were gone,

you never once said
you were sorry to me,

you never once said

you were sorry
to the children.

What did you think
we were thinking?

OK.

Or feeling?

All right. OK.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I love you.

Don't let this one thing
destroy the family.

No one in this
family is destroyed.

Will you give me
a second chance?

I'm sorry.

Fine.

Anthony: Javier!

Javier!

Javier!

Javier!

[Door slams shut]

[Car engine starts]

It's ok.

Where's Anthony?

Mom...I'm sorry.

[Car tires squeal]

It's gonna
be all right.

All you working women,
you earn big salaries,

but before you know it,
your face falls,

your body drops,
and it's too late.

What good is a big house
and vacations

if you don't have
someone to share?

Art: Anybody want
some more ice cream?

Ruth: Nowadays, they all
have good friends

who are just like family.

You want cool whip,
or you want ice cream?

Is it low-fat?

No, it's not.
Have the cool whip.

Rachel: Sorry, mom.

I have something that
I want to tell you all,

and--and--and I've been meaning
to say it for a while,

but I haven't been able
to quite figure out how, so--

Rachel.

But I figure that since...

Since you're gonna know
soon enough,

I might as well tell you.

Rachel.

Art: D-dad,
shh.

This is something that
I really, really want.

Rachel.
I'm...

Art: Dad, no.

I'm pregnant.

What?

I'm having a baby.

Oh, mazel tov!
Oh, it's wonderful!

Isn't that great, dad?

But you're
a lesbian.

What?
What did he say?

Art: Dad, come on.

Rachel is a lesbian.
You know, like Ellen.

Who's the father?

It doesn't matter
who the father is.

Herb: Who's
the father?

Ellen Lieberman?
The butcher's wife?

Rachel: It doesn't matter
who the father is.

Herb: Of course it matters
who the father is.

It doesn't matter.

How are you gonna bring up
a child without a father?

Bea: Herb, Ruth.

Everybody just be quiet
and calm down

because the twins
are getting upset.

Listen, dad. It's very
common these days.

And Rachel and Carla are
gonna be great parents.

Herb: I just wanna--

I'm questioning what's
right for the child.

All that--dad.
Daddy.

All that matters is that
I have a baby inside of me.

And I--and I don't even know
what it's gonna look like.

I mean, we don't know.

We think it's gonna be a boy,
but we're not sure.

But I--I try to imagine
what he's gonna look like

in our home
with Carla in it,

and what his life
is gonna be like

and...Whether or not

you're even gonna
want to know him.

All I want to know
is who the father is.

It doesn't matter.

Dad, haven't you
been listening?

Was it an accident?

Did you have some
kind of affair?

Herbie, please. You're gonna
have a heart attack.

Was it
an accident?

It wasn't.
I had a donor.

Some anonymous man?

Well, what if he had

some disease
or something?

He doesn't!

How do you know?
You don't know that.

Because I know.

Herb:
You don't know!

He doesn't have any disease.

I know because it's Jerry.

But he's gay!

Sarah's brother,
he's a faggela?

Look, dad.
That doesn't matter, OK?

The point is, this baby is
gonna be part of our family.

That's what matters.

Bea: So, is the baby
Jewish?

[Knock on door]

Oh, don't worry
about it, dad.

I think
it's for me.

Wait--

What's up?
Is Gary here?

Don, don't worry about it.
I got all--

No! He'll call you
later.

Jen!

Gary, stop it!

Gary's in
serious trouble.

Don't let him go
after those kids.

Gary,
go sit down.

What the heck, Jenny?
He's just my friend.

Come on!

Gary, sit down!

Joey, got to talk
to mom and dad, OK?

What about the pumpkin pie?
We gotta have that next.

Just go play
in your room, OK?

OK.

No! No!

Jenny:
Make Gary stay!

Gary, sit down!

What's the matter
with you?

Tell us, Gary.
What is it?

Here. I found it
under his bed.

Trinh:
Where did you get this?

Where did you get this?

Look, it's not mine, ok?
I promise.

Well, whose is it?

My friend asked me to
hold onto it, all right?

He was afraid of
these guys at school.

It doesn't matter, Gary!

How can you bring a gun
into the house, huh?

I-It's not a toy, you know.
It's not like the movies!

How do you think
your mom and I would feel

if we came home
and found you dead, huh?

Gary...

Are you in a gang?

Gary.
Gary!

Where are
you going?

Come back here!

Gary, no!

Stop! Stop it,
all right?

Gary, I was only
trying to help.

Why'd you have
to tell them?

I told you it wasn't mine!

If you don't say anything,
we can't help you!

Are you in a gang, Gary?

No!

I'm not that stupid,
all right?

Why do you have a gun
in our house?

Is it Don's?

Wh-why does don
have a gun?

Some guys jumped him
and took his jacket.

He started cussing
him out,

and now they're
after him.

What the--what am I
supposed to do?

Huh?

He's my best friend!

Gary:
Dad, I gotta back him up.

Why didn't you tell
a teacher?

'Cause teachers
can't do shit!

They can't protect us
after school.

We don't want to read about you
in the newspapers, huh?

We came here to
get away from guns,

and you play with them
like toys.

Grandpa, this is not
Vietnam, all right?

You don't know what
it's like outside.

I'm afraid to go
to school.

I don't want to die.

I don't--I don't want to
be scared all the time.

What? I only found it
this morning,

and that's why I
was talking to Luke.

You talked to a stranger?
And you didn't tell us?

Yeah. Because we
don't talk about stuff

like other families do.


Aah!

What the hell
was that?

Kristen, sit.
Get her, Grace.

Oh, my God.

I think that came
from your house.

Is anyone hurt?

Should I call
an ambulance?

What happened?

The little boy
in that house

is one of
my students.

Rachel!

Rachel, come on
in the house!

I guess they'll call an
ambulance if they need it.

It's none of your
business. Come on.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm coming.

Hold on, kid.
Hold on.

Just a second.

I wanna make sure
everyone's all right.

Hey, you guys
know what happened?

Where did it come from?

It sounded like
a car backfiring.

That's what
I thought it was.

I thought
it was a car.

It's definitely a shot.
Look at the window.

They just moved into
the neighborhood.

[Overlapping comments]

Yo. Come here
and help me.

[Indistinct chatter]

You stay in there,
Jose, right now!

Why do they have to keep
a gun in the house?

I'm telling you, ruthy,
before you know it,

you're gonna have
a triad war

in this neighborhood.
Triad war.

Ruth.

Ruth: Yes.

I just can't
understand.

Is the father
still the father,

or is somebody else
gonna be the father?

Good night.
Good night, Bea.

Good night, David.

Gina, you think I should
go and help them out?

No. They're probably fine
on their own.

All right.

Come on, honey.

Ok, babe. We can go.

Gina...

I met his father at
the store yesterday.

He is a good man.

I think
it would be ok.

â™ª Wouldn't it be nice
if we were older? â™ª

â™ª Then we wouldn't have
to wait so long â™ª

â™ª And wouldn't it be nice
to live together â™ª

â™ª In the kind of world
where we belong? â™ª

Hey, Jimmy.

â™ª You know it's gonna make it
that much better â™ª

â™ª When we can say good night
and stay together â™ª

â™ª Wouldn't it be nice
if we could wake up â™ª

â™ª In the morning
when the day is new? â™ª

â™ª And after having spent
the day together â™ª

â™ª Hold each other close
the whole night through? â™ª

â™ª Happy times together
we've been spending â™ª

â™ª I wish that every kiss
was neverending â™ª

â™ª Wouldn't it be nice?

Oh, please forgive me.

â™ª You know it seems
the more we talk about it â™ª

â™ª It only makes it worse
to live without it â™ª

â™ª But let's talk about it

It's really nice
to meet you all.

Please.

Dad: Jimmy.


Looks good, mom.

Another good
Thanksgiving dinner.

Joey, I heard you were
in a Thanksgiving play.

How'd it go?

Joey: It was good.

I held the big, fat turkey.

Duc: You were a turkey?

Joey: No!

[All chuckle]

â™ª Ba, ba ba ba,
ba ba ba â™ª

â™ª Doo doo da

â™ª Ba, ba ba ba,
ba ba ba â™ª

â™ª Doo doo da

Oh, Michael, I just
want to tell you

I understand what
you're going through.

But I'm telling you,

life's gonna be real hard
without an education.

I know.

I just want you to know,
from me, from my heart,

I support any decision
you make.

He's not over it,
is he?

He is.
He is.

â™ª You know it seems
the more we talk about it â™ª

â™ª It only makes it worse
to live without it â™ª

â™ª But let's talk about it

I don't think we should
get the blue tiles.

I always wanted,
what do you call it?

A natural stone,

what do you call it?

Hey, mom, do you
need some help?

Who wants a cappuccino?

Dad, can you move over?
You're blocking the jets.

Oh, there's plenty
of dessert left over.

â™ª Wouldn't it be nice?

â™ª Ba, ba ba ba,
ba ba ba â™ª

â™ª Good night, baby

â™ª Sleep tight, baby

â™ª Good night, baby

â™ª Sleep tight, baby

â™ª Good night, baby

â™ª Sleep tight, baby
