Hallelujah!

Yes!

Yes!

Whoo!

Whoo!

Whoo!
Good morning, mount bethel!

-Good morning!
-Good morning!

I feel the spirit of the lord
in this place this morning!

-Oh, let the church say amen?
-Amen!

-Come on, say amen again!
-Amen.

-Hallelujah, hallelujah!
-Hallelujah.

Now, today, we honor
a true servant of god.

A young woman
who has committed herself

to the service of people
here at bethel.

Everything from preaching
in my absence,

to organizing ministries.
She is your assistant pastor.


I'm so proud to announce
that Olivia will be leaving us

to pastor her very own church
in greenwood, Texas!

Won't he do it?

I said, won't he do it?


hallelujah!

Won't he do it?

<i> â™ª what a friend we have</i>
<i> in Jesus... â™ª</i>

Texas!

My own church?
When were you gonna tell me?

Sweetheart, we've been talking
about this for years.

I'm not ready, mom, there's
still so much I have to learn...

Livi, Livi, stop, stop.

God has prepared you for this.

Your father and I have given you
everything that you need.

Trust and believe in you.

I'm not sure if I can.

Then trust in god.

And believe in your mama,
I got your back.

Listen, listen, it's a small
church in a small town.

God has given you the gift
of leadership and service.

Go serve the king.

Besides, that's in your blood.

Going all the way back
to your great-great-grandfather.

Okay.

What's the name of the church?

-You ready?
-No.


genesis baptist church.

-New beginnings.
-Mm-hmm.

I like that.

Wait, how did you even find out
about the position?

Miss Corrine, a friend of mine
from my spelman days.

She and I got to chatting
about a few things,

and one thing lead to another.

And here we are.

Okay. When do I leave?

-Two days.
-Two days?

I'm gonna miss Christmas!

I know.

Daddy, how am I supposed
to pack up my entire life

in two days?

Just take what you need,
and we'll send the rest later.

Livi, talk to me, sweetheart.

-What's going on?
-I'm so used to assisting mom.

Not actually being her.

Hm, that's the thing,
you are not her, you're you.

And this church
will love you for you.

-[door shuts]
-who's hungry?

I bought someone's favorite.

I know that smell a mile away.

Yes! Thank you!

Livi...

I have something
very special just for you.

The family bible.

This bible has been passed down

to each pastor in our family
for generations.

Your grandpa Wesley
gave me this bible

when I first started
preaching and singing,

and now I'm giving it to you.

The next singing-pastor in line!

Can we just stick to pastor?

Livi, stop denying your roots.

You can't let one moment
stronghold you

for the rest of your life.

It was a very traumatic moment,
mom.

Then go tell it, livi.

Let it set you free.

But you are a singing pastor.

bigger than your fears."

ah, Hebrews 13:6.

Actually, mom,
I think the scripture reads,

"the lord is my helper,
I will not be afraid."

it's the essence
of the scripture.

See, you were born to lead.

Always remember that.
And sing.

-Mom.
-Unh-uh. Mm-mm.

Bring it in, come on.

Bring it in, hug your mama.

-I love you.
-I love you more, baby girl.

[airplane droning]

<i> â™ª tell 'em he's our healer â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª I want you to go â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª go tell 'em that Jesus... â™ª</i>

I got this.

<i> â™ª is â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª tell 'em that Jesus Christ</i>
<i> is born â™ª</i>

don't be scared, livi.

Let your faith be bigger than
your fears.

You got this.

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

<i> â™ª tell he's our savior â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª I want you to go â™ª</i>

-oh! I'm so sorry.
-Whoa!

-I am so sorry.
-It's okay.

Here, let me help you.
Um, I'm Olivia.

Uh, I am pastor Olivia Richard.

Oh, you're pastor Richard,
I've been waiting on you.

Uh, the church, the church
has been waiting on you.

Wow, where did that come from?


I'm gonna run these
to the cleaners.

It was a pleasure meeting you.

You, too.

Pastor Richard!

Welcome to genesis!

-Hello, you must be...
-Dorothea deeds.

But everybody calls me miss dee.

Let me be the first to welcome
you to greenwood, Texas.

We're small, but mighty!

-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Uh-hmm.

The decorations are fantastic!

That just warms my heart,
pastor.

-You did this?
-Yes, ma'am.

Not only am I the
administrative assistant,

but I'm also
the resident decorator.

I wear a lot of hats
around here, pastor.

Luke 12:48...

-"too whom much is given..."
-"much is required."

amen, pastor.

You'll get the hang of things
around here soon enough.

Now, let me show you
to your office.

Okay.

Well, normally, I handle
the day-to-day operations

so that you can just focus
on the ministries

and grow our church.

Well, that was the agreement

between pastor Byrd and me.

It's totally okay
if you wanna change it.

Oh, no, no.
In the spirit of pastor Byrd,

let's, let's just keep it
the way it is.

Do miss that man.
He was a great pastor.

Big shoes to fill.

But you'll be all right.

Here's your office, pastor.

Oh.


welcome to your new office,
pastor.

I got a little fun and free
back here.

It's, it's so festive.

Thank you, pastor! I was so
proud of the way it turned out.

I had to put it
on the social medias.

It's just a little more
than I anticipated.

I-I'm more simple,

modest, clean lines, you know.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, don't worry about that,

brother Carl is working
on your name plate.

That's pastor Byrd.
I'm so sorry.

-I'll take it out immediately.
-It's okay.

-And this?
-That's the winter jamboree.

It's the highlight of
greenwood's Christmas season.

Every Christmas eve,
genesis opens up the festival.

-It's tradition!
-I love tradition.

Gonna miss mine this year.

Well, who said you couldn't
bring your tradition

to greenwood, pastor?
What's your favorite tradition?

-The Christmas party.
-Oh, I love a good party.

We're gonna circle back
around to that.

Okay. Did pastor Byrd
direct the choir?

Oh, pastor, our choir was fire!

Pastor Byrd took great pride
in it.

Next to the almighty himself,
music was his true love.

-A singing pastor.
-Oh, he did it all.

But I know you got this!


-You say something, pastor?
-U-um, uh-hmm.

-The parsonage?
-Oh, yes! Well... No.

There was no saving
the parsonage.

So until we find you a place,
you're staying with me.

-Oh, no, um, miss, miss...
-no, ma'am.

It's settled.

Oh, what has momma done.

[bell rings]

[indistinct chatter]

welcome to Selah's.
What can I do you for?

Well, I hear you have
the best burger in town.

-And you heard right.
-Nice.

-With or without cheese?
-Without.

Coming right up. Uh...

Your money's no good here,
pastor.

Word travels quick.

It'll be up in a minute.
Find yourself a seat.

Thank you.

Pastor Olivia?


Sure.

[instrumental music]

I didn't expect to see you again
so soon.

I wasn't looking for you,
I'm-I'm just saying...

Y-you... Yeah.

Well, this is a small town,

I'll probably see you
two more times

by the end of the night.

Really?

-Stella, this is...
-pastor Olivia.

Come on, Ashton, catch up!

-Now, you two, enjoy.
-Thank you.

-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

Oh, so you... You gonna eat that
with a knife and fork?

It's a burger.
You're supposed to pick it up

with your hands
and bite into it.

Ooh, look at the...
You have a...

-It's supposed to be messy.
-Uh-huh.

I would prefer to keep my sauce
on my burger.


whatever.

I can get you a knife and fork
if you really want.

Uh, no, thank you.

-You're somethin' else.
-Oh...


I was just like...

Oh, my god.

I didn't realize
how much time had passed.

I'm sure miss dee
is worried about me.

-You at dee's?
-Yeah.

That's right around the corner.
I'll walk you.

-Okay.
-Okay.

So, what brings you
to greenwood?

-[sighs] my mother.
-Mm.

Yeah, she got to talking with
her old spelman friend,

miss Corrine and, uh,

the two of them devised this
plan to get me here.

Wow, so your mother
and miss Corrine

ain't give you an option?

-Nope.
-I know.

-No, no, no option there.
-No.

[instrumental music]

my mother does it
so effortlessly.

How am I supposed to be like
her? Or pastor Byrd?

Just, just some
huge shoes to fill.

Well, maybe you're just supposed
to be like you.

I'm all too familiar with trying
to be something I'm not.

Oh. And what was that?

Well, lookie here,
we have arrived.

Pastor, it has been my pleasure
spending my afternoon with you.

Please just call me Olivia.

And the pleasure was all mine.

-Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?
-It's a small town.


-Have a good evening.
-You, too.

[instrumental music]

-pastor.
-[Olivia] j-just a moment!

Just making sure
you're comfortable.

-You need anything?
-No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

Okay. So, Ashton. A fan fav?

-Miss dee!
-Oh, I'm not in your business.

I'm just nosey.


hey, you rest well, pastor.

-I zhuzh'd it up a little.
-You did.

Oh. And don't forget your
leadership meeting tomorrow.

-9:00 a.M., sharp.
-Got it.

-Goodnight.
-Night, pastor.

[instrumental music]

father, I come before you
as your daughter

lost in her wilderness,
and seeking your guidance.

Teach me to lead like my mom.

Your humble servant. Amen.

Sorry, mom.
The day got away from me.

Uh, but things are good,

Um, the town is small.

-But the people seem friendly.
<i> -Oh, the people seem friendly.</i>

<i>Hm. Make sure you meet Corrine.</i>

<i> -Oh, and she has a son...</i>
-my leadership meeting!

I gotta go. I love you.

[instrumental music]

-she'll be right...
-oh, sorry, I'm late.

-Oh, there she is!
-Good morning, everyone!

A good morning would've been
if you were on time,

but you're late.
And you have coffee?

-I, I...
-Sister ida, behave.

She got that coffee
from my house.

Oh, she's staying with you.

Well, you were on time.

Look, let me just say my piece.

My dearly departed brother

dedicated his life
to this ministry.

-Sister ida...
-un-uh-uh-uh!

And ain't no fancy
mega-church assistant pastor

gonna come up in here and undo
all the good that he has done.

Sister ida, I am here to support
and to grow...

you think you know
the first thing

about running a church,
assistant pastor?

-I'm here to try.
-Oh.

We ain't got no time to try.

Things need your attention.

This is the Christmas season,

everybody looks to the church
for leadership.

There's the wrap it up,
toy wrapping party,

the ho-ho-ho Santa
can food drive...

Could you start over?
I just want to...

there's the three wisemen's
mobile meals...

The winter jamboree!

I was about to say that, Stella!

And the winter jamboree, which
is our premiere Christmas event.

Oh, and don't forget the
paperwork, assistant pastor.

The jamboree's in five weeks.

You fail the jamboree,
you fail the church.

And remember,
this is your trial period.

You ain't got the job yet.

We'll determine that
by the new year.

Oh, and the "sent from an angel"
holiday cards.

-Holiday cards?
-For our sick and shut-in.


I'm working on that name plate,
pastor. Okay?

Brother Carl, her husband.

Thank you. Thank you.

Don't pay ida any mind.

-She's grieving.
-I'm on a trial period?

Yes. All new pastors
have a short trial period.

Make sure we're a good fit,
is all.

You'll win sister ida over.

You got this.

Thank you.

Do I?

[instrumental music]


Well, why don't we just let
nature take its course?

-[chuckles] uh-hmm.
-[door opens]

ooh, got to go.

Pastor Olivia Richard!

If you aren't
the spitting image of Etta!

Miss Corrine?

So, how you liking
old greenwood?

I'm adjusting. It's cute.

It's really small.

Honey, I can't wait to hear you
bring a word on Sunday.

Hmm, I know you're gonna be
just as strong

and powerful as your mother.

Hmm, and ain't nothing like
a singing pastor.

-Singing?
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

The church wanted
another singing pastor.

And if you can sing
anything like your mother,

we gonna be all right.

Yes. Yes.

So, I hear you are
looking for a place?

-I am.
-Mom?

-Ashton?
-Oh!

So you're the reason

my son has been so smitten?

Ashton, pastor Olivia
is looking for a place to stay.

I'll see you in church
on Sunday, pastor.

Yes, ma'am.

Mother?

Okay, so you are a man
of many hats.

Man of many hats
at your service.

I have a few to show you.

[instrumental music]

Etta...

I have to sing
to keep my job, mom.

<i> -Well, hello to you too, livi.</i>
-Why would you do that?

Why would you send me here
knowing I don't sing?

<i> Livi, you do sing.</i>
<i> You come from a long line of...</i>

yeah, mom, I don't wanna
hear that, okay?

I'm not you. No one can be
the great pastor Etta Richard.

Besides, they want to hear you
sing, not me!

<i> No, they don't.</i>

<i> They wanna hear you sing.</i>
<i> Now, you, you may not like</i>

<i> how I got you to greenwood,</i>

<i> but you're gonna have to face</i>
<i> this trauma.</i>

<i> You're gonna have to</i>
<i> look it in the eye.</i>

<i> You're gonna have to call it</i>
<i> out and rebuke it.</i>

<i> Sweetheart, you're hiding your</i>
<i> gift from the world.</i>

I love you,
but right now, I just...

I gotta go.

I did not put my best foot
forward today.

My mother has never been late
for a leadership meeting.

She always says, "the church is
a direct reflection

of its leadership,
inadequate Shepard, lost sheep."

your mother is a
powerful preacher.

You've heard my mom preach?

Corrine dragged me to Chicago
a few times to hear her.

Now, your momma
can bring the word. And sing.

I can't wait to hear
that voice on you!

-I don't sing.
-Well, sure, you do.

-I heard you.
-I don't... I don't sing.

<i> â™ª jingle bells jingle bells â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª jingle all the way... â™ª</i>

help me out.

So, um...

I've been thinking
about that list

sister ida was rattling off,

and it's intimidating.

I don't wanna fail the church.
And god knows,

I-I cannot fail my mom.

Look, you're right,

it's intimidating.

But you got a calling, pastor.

So, we'll take it
one step at a time.

-"we?"
-yes.

I'm with you all the way.

And don't think pastor Byrd
had it all together.

His first year was a mess.
Girl, he almost quit.

Now, back to that list.

On Friday, brother Carl's
gonna drop off

the box of Christmas cards.

And the Christmas committee
has already organized

"the wrap it up"
toy wrapping party.

-That's next Saturday.
-Next Saturday. Okay.

-Just show up. Oh, on time.
-Mm-hmm.


now, tell me about the sermon
you're preparing for Sunday.

Well...

It's about turning...

-Let the church say, amen!
-Amen.

Amen, amen!
Before we begin,

I want to take a moment
to thank miss dee...

you're welcome, pastor.

Thank you so much, miss dee.

I understand
it is tradition for her

to do the decorations
around the holidays.

I also understand it is
tradition to count down

to the glorious jamboree!


hallelujah! Now on that note,

the word says to "make a joyful
noise unto the lord."


it says to serve
the lord with...

-Gladness!
-Hallelu...

It says to come before his
presence with singing.

Come on, choir,
bless us through song.

-All right, praise Jesus.
-Praise Jesus.

Yes, god!

Hallelujah!

what on god's green earth
are you doing?

-Here, let me help you.
-Ooh.

Just thought I would get a jump
on things and help pastor out.

Sister ida gonna scare her off
before she can get started good.

-Sister ida is grieving.
-No.

Sister ida is mean.

And somebody should tell her.

Oh, no, honey, god's got to a
special angel for that one.

And he knows my heart
and I ain't it.

I thought pastor was gonna sing
during her sermon.

She will.
In god's time, not in our time.

Well, it's nice having
a female leader.

Is she gonna be okay?
Make it to the new year?

Yeah, just give her some time.

Just give her some time.
The Grinch need time, too.

Sister ida.


[instrumental music]

wait a minute.

Oh, my, that is beautiful.

[keys clacking]

yes!

Oh, this house looks
even better in person.

Let me help you up these stairs.

Thank you.

Wow.

Wait until you see inside.



[piano music]

sold.

But you haven't even seen
the rest of the house yet.

No need.
I saw it all on zillow.

But seriously,
walk through the house.

Take it all in.

Let's see what this old piano
can do.

[piano music]

<i> â™ª they've taken Christ</i>
<i> from Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª filled it with earthly joys â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª like frosty and Rudolph â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª even a drummer boy â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª they need to know â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª that Christ is Christmas â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª they need to know â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª that Christ is Christmas â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª sent down to save</i>

<i> â™ª that's why he came</i>

<i> â™ª that's why he came</i>
<i> my friend â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª they really need to know â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª they really â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª need to know â™ª</i>


-Oh. I play a little.
-A little?

You should be sharing this gift
with the world.

Well, I should be. But maybe
god saw it differently.

-That didn't work out.
-Oh, I can't believe that.

So, why didn't it work out?

What didn't work out?
The singing? The playing?

Because your gift...

are you trying to pastor me
right now?

-Please don't.
-No, I-I...

I wasn't trying to pastor you.

I was genuinely interested.

I'm sorry.

You didn't deserve that.

I failed as a musician.

My motto is
"you gotta be all in."

'cause that's how you
gotta live life.

So, I moved to Houston,
and connected

with some of auntie ida's
old band members

and started gigging.

Everything was going great.

We were making money,
packing the house,

working on a record deal.

And then the bottom fell out.

The deal just disappeared.

So, I turned to what I know,
real estate.

And I stayed in Houston
until I finally got that call,

"your father is ready to retire,
turn the business over to you."

so started packing,
and now I'm here.

I'm not mad to be home...

'cause dope things
can happen anywhere.

You just got to be open to it.

You didn't fail.

-You should play with us.
-Play with who?

You should play for the church.

Yeah, the-the church needs
a choir director,

you need to be making music,
and I need somebody

to whip that choir into shape.
Come on!

I have not played
in that church in years.

Help me get ready
for the jamboree

and get me one up on sister ida.

Who is your aunt!

You kept that close
to the chest there.

I feel like you owe me.

Where's your Christmas spirit?
Come on!

Please?

Please? Please?

All in,
'cause that's how we gotta be.

Of course.

[indistinct chatter]

hello! Woo-hoo!

This is not working.
Excuse me?

[piano music]

thank you.

Brother Carl,
would you please do the honors?

[clears throat]
uh, yes.

We got to talking and decided
it would be ideal

if brother Ashton would take
over as the choir director.


thankfully, I'm going to retire

back to the tenor section
where I belong.

[woman 1] amen!

[indistinct chatter]

okay, then I guess
you got it from here.

Godspeed. You have about three
weeks, but no pressure.

You got this!

Well, I thought we'd start off
with an old hymn.

-Knock knock! Howdy, pastor?
-How's the choir?

-Here you go.
-Oh, wait, you...

You were supposed to deliver
those last Friday.

-It's Tuesday.
-I'm late.

-Whoa, whoa, what're you doing?
-Oh.

Sister ida wants this box back.
Sorry, pastor.

How many sick and shut-in
do we have?

-Pastor.
-What?

There's a deluge
in the women's restroom.

-A what? No!
-A flood. A flood.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

[instrumental music]

god, this cannot be happening.

The Christmas toy wrapping party
is on Saturday, and I can't...

You tired of playing pastor,
yet, assistant pastor?

[instrumental music]

pastor, I am so glad
you decided to move

this toy wrapping party
to the community center.

It's so refreshing
for the community to see...

The church doing such good work.

I can't believe the church
donated all of these toys.

Hey, each year it keeps growing
bigger and bigger.

It's crazy, just five years ago
auntie ida started this drive.

Wait, sister ida
started the toy drive?

Yep, a little girl
walked up to her,

asked her for some change
for her family.

Auntie says she looked around,
realized

she was in the middle
of a homeless encampment.

There was a small Christmas tree
and nativity scene.

And right then she just knew.

-Sister ida?
-Mm-hmm!

Yeah, she just bought up
a bunch of toys,

gave some to the little girl and
started passing out the rest

to the church members in need.

yeah, kinda of became a thing.

We...

We're talking about that,
that one,

that sister ida started this?

-She's grieving.
-She's grieving.

Okay, sister ida.

Excuse me, everyone,
if I could have your attention

for a moment?

When I found out
that the toy wrapping party

was a genesis tradition,
it warmed my heart.

And it really made me miss the
Christmas traditions from home.

Miss dee said I didn't have to
leave my traditions in Chicago,

she said I could
bring them here.

So, at mount bethel,

we have the giving wreath.

It does come with one rule,
in order to take something,

you must leave something.

A token, a small handmade
something, a card.

Anything that will allow it
to continue to give

throughout the advent season.

Just a special way to continue
to celebrate each other.

So, please enjoy the wreath
that keeps on giving!


-oh, I'm going first!
-No.


well, that is so great.

Yeah, my dad loves Christmas.

He made up this tradition.

He wanted the church to give
back to the community more,

during the season.

Okay, well, since
we're sharing traditions,

how about I introduce you
to greenwood's

annual cookie hop
tomorrow night?

A cookie hop?

-Sounds fun.
-It is.

So it's a date?

Ah, saved you a piece
of Christmas pie.

Yes!

tomorrow night.

I should've known
you were listening.

Oh, pastor, it's not my fault
your business

is the talk of the town.

The town?

Aww, don't be embarrassed.
What else we gone talk about?

It's the juiciest thing
we got going on.

And the cookie hop, such a
public and festive evening out.

-Everybody's gonna be there?
-Oh, everybody, pastor.

So, what are we wearing?

Well, I-I was thinking this,
but in a different color.

Pastor, it's a date,
not a baptismal.

Show a little shoulder.

Oh, now, come on, grab that
wreath and the hot glue gun.

-Okay.
-And let's talk cookie hop.

[both laughing]

-Ashton?
-Oh, wow.

beautiful.

Your hand, please.

I got us wrist bands so we can
sample all the cookies.

Mm-hmm?
Now what is a cookie hop?

Okay. So every Christmas,

all the bakers, professional
or not, they all compete

for the "best cookie in town"
title.

Oh. See, we don't have that
in Chicago,

so this is gonna be fun.

Uh, come on.

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chatter]

wait, so let's talk about
that perfect chord you

hit the other day.

I don't know
what you talking about.

-Yes, you do.
-Unh-unh.

-So you play a little?
-A little.

I come from a family
of musicians and singers.

My mother, grandfather,
great-grandfather.

-All singing pastors.
-Wait, so you sing.

-Let's hear it!
-Nope. My mother sings.

-I listen.
-Mm, come on, let me hear you.

I don't sing. I don't.
Plus, we're at a cookie hop.

Nah, I'm with you.

-So tell me why you don't sing.
-Ashton, come on.

Fine.

Being a preacher's kid is a lot,

but being a pk under
my mother's shadow,

even now,
it's a ton of pressure.

-And?
-And...


it was my first solo.

It's kind of a rite of passage
in our family.

I had to be like 15 or 16.

And there I was
shaking like a leaf.

And I did it
and I was so proud of myself,

until the room got quiet.

I open my eyes and the choir
director comes to me and says,

"you're supposed to be
pastor Richard's daughter

and that's all you got."

wow.

I just stood there ashamed
and in disbelief.

I'm sorry to hear that.

-Church hurt is real.
-Yeah.

But I still wanna hear you sing.

-Boy!
-I'm just saying.

I mean, look,
this is all we got.

-You gotta be all in.
-All in.

-Yes, I know your motto.
-Right. Yup, all the time.

Wait, hold up.
Did she keep her job?

Did she... No, no!

-She was gone the next day.
-All right.

All right.

You got a little...

[instrumental music]

with all your heart

and do not lean
on your own understanding.

[cellphone chimes]


[indistinct chatter]

sister ida, it would be nice
to hear some good news from you.

Dee, don't you use that tone
with me, little girl.

I know your mama.
I'm just sayin',

I got strong numbers on that
board ready to vote her out.

We're looking
for a singing pastor. A leader.

Ashton, play my song. I need a
little holiday joy up in here.

Yes!

[applause and cheering]

you know the fresh air
is good for you.


I didn't mean to scare you.

What's wrong?

You can tell?

I pay very close
attention to you.

I'm not sure my mother made the
right decision sending me here.

As assistant pastor, it never
all fell on my shoulders.

And trying to take care
of everyone, it's just...

How about
taking care of Olivia?

Give yourself a break
and just have some fun.

<i> â™ª let's go â™ª</i>

[applause continues]

choir...
That choir sang today.

Yeah, choir did its part,

it's time for me to
bring this word. Amen!

-[all] amen!
-[Olivia] amen! Turn with me...


turn with me to
Hebrews 13:6. Amen.

-[indistinct chatter]
-[Olivia] Whoo!

[instrumental music]

one candy cane freeze for me,

and one coco-la-da Christmas
milkshake for you.

-Hah!
-[Ashton chuckling]

how did you know
this is my favorite?

A little birdie told me.

-Thank you. Uh-hmm.
-[both chuckle]

I miss Chicago.

My mom, dad...

But this town is
starting to feel like home.

[Olivia chuckles]

so, they build this every year?

Yep. One of my favorite things
to do every Christmas holiday.

Guess you can call it
my tradition.

[both chuckle]

so, Olivia, who is no longer
pastor for tonight.

Right.

-Shall we play?
-Oh, we shall.

-Hah.
-[Ashton chuckling]

come on. Come on.

All right.
I'm hats, you're bells.

See, you're cheating,
there's clearly two pieces

already on the board.

You snooze, you lose.

Oh, you ain't right.

ah! Nice move.

Ah!

You know...

I'm starting to like
being just Olivia.

-Tic-tac-toe! I win!
-Wh... What?

[both laugh]

I like just Olivia.

"in his glorious name...

Pastor Olivia."

[chuckles softly]
they may not be on time,

but they are in god's time.

-You want me to help?
-No, no.

Pastor Byrd did it, so can I.

A little secret,
I helped him.


-[sighs] I'm gonna head out.
-Okay.

Want me to pick you up
a coco-lada shake?

-Yes, please.
-See you in a bit.

Bye.

Okay.

-Yes...
-They're late.

Yes.

They will be late this year,

but they'll get there.

I'm starting to get
a handle on things.

-Mm-hm.
-Did you hear the choir Sunday?

Oh, they sounded amazing.

they're going to be ready.

You think they're going to be
ready for exactly what?

The winter jamboree.

Ah, the same winter jamboree
that I told you

it was imperative to
turn in the paperwork.

-That winter jamboree?
-Yes.

Then where in god's name
is the church on this flyer?

Surely, not the headlining act.

No, it can't be, be...

This can't be, because I-I
definitely turned it in.

-I know I did...
-[ida] oh.

handling things?

Well, I'm gonna call an
emergency leadership meeting.

I think we need to seriously
discuss your trial period.

Why do you hate me?

I don't hate you.

You, you don't belong here.

And you're not a leader
like my brother.

Your brother was a
great man of god...

And you better never forget.

[indistinct chatter]

<i> â™ª a few days to December â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª it's a time to remember â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª all the joys and the one</i>

<i> â™ª go outside... â™ª</i>

some flyers together

for distribution real quick,
please?

-Uh-huh. Sure.
-Thank you very much.

Councilman hanks.

Well, ho-ho-ho.
Happy holidays!

Welcome to our little workshop.
You must be here to volunteer.

Oh, no. No.
I'm Olivia.

I'm the new pastor
over at genesis.

-Oh, yes! Yes. Hi.
-Hi.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear
about pastor Byrd.

That man had a heart for giving.

And his choir, oh!
You know, it's a shame

they won't be participating
this year.

Actually, that's what I'm
wanting to discuss.

We want to participate.

Oh, pastor, I'm sorry.

That paperwork had to be
in a week ago.

I mean, normally pastor Byrd
would've had it

in a month in advance,
and since I didn't hear anything

from the church, I had to
book another act.

Mr. Hanks, I need a win here.
Okay?

I-I can't go back to that choir
and tell them that

all of this hard work they've
been doing is for naught.

I forgot to turn in
the paperwork,

that's on me, not them.
Please just...

In the spirit of Christmas,
let them perform.

Pastor, I wish I could, but the
lineup's already booked.

There just isn't any room.

Just like with Mary and Joseph.

But this is the season
for miracles.

Thank you, councilman.

-Oh, excuse me.
-Sure.

anyone else was here.

You've been hiding that voice?

It's so, so powerful.

-Stop, just...
-[Ashton] no, seriously.

It's like you told me, you,

you got to share this
with the world.

Uh-uh. No.
What are you doing here?

You talked to your auntie.

keep that to herself.

I cannot believe I forgot
to turn in the paperwork.

I don't understand how my mother
juggles this responsibility.

Why didn't you
just ask for help?

[Olivia chuckles] uh-uh. No.

And give sister ida, your
auntie, more ammunition?

You know how she loves pointing
at my grave mistakes.

Oh. Come on, Olivia, no.

-She's...
-She's grieving. I know.

But I think I have an idea.

Come up, I'll show you.


So I found the band on the
flyer that's headlining.

It's a rock band,
but it's gonna work. Trust me.

I trust you,
but is it gonna work?

I've done my research.
Come on, where's my support?

We got this.

[upbeat music]

right.
So, what do you think?

-They sound great.
-I know.

Do you think they'll be
down to play gospel?

Oh, ye of little faith. Red.

-Hey. What's up?
-Hey. Hi, I'm Olivia.

-And this is... Ashton.
-Wassup?

-[chuckles]
-right.

And you were looking for a
band to play at your church?

Not exactly.
I wanted to pitch an idea.

So, you know the choir that
normally opens the jamboree?

Oh, yeah.
Their sound is sweet.

Yeah. It is.

I'm actually kind of nervous
that, ah, we're replacing them,

'cause we don't sing,
and you know,

people want to hear singing.

Well, you know, since you
don't sing and we do,

how about we perform together?

Do what now?

Look, I'm the new pastor
at genesis and I...

I forgot to submit
the paperwork.

-[chuckles]
-I know. Yes, that's on me.

But I figured
it was worth a shot

to see if we could collaborate.

Ah, but it's one week.

Plus, I don't know.
Rock and gospel?

Yeah. I'm hearing a whole
other sound all together.

Yeah, and we don't sing,
so voices could be cool.

And you said yourself,
people want to hear singing.

-[laughing] I did say that.
-That's the "gotcha."


yeah.


Assistant pastor,
is this is your solution?

Now, wait a minute, ida.
Give her a chance to explain.

Yes. It is my solution.

Look, I know
I failed the church.

But god has given us an
opportunity for the choir

to perform and for us
to minister.

I'm not gonna
turn my back on that.

Besides, I believe pastor Byrd
would be honored.

Don't bring my brother
into this.

He is this.

He is the embodiment of
the Christmas spirit.

He was the servant for the king,
he loved the people

and the people loved him. And I
think this is a beautiful way

to celebrate his legacy.

Well, you may be on to something
there. But rock-n-roll?

Ain't nothing wrong with a
little prince for the prince.

[Stella chuckling]
yeah, sister ida.

I mean, kirk Franklin
had a rock song.

Well, you know I love me
some kirk. He's a bad boy.

But don't you all be bringing
the prince up in here,

'cause the only dove that's
going to be crying in here

is the prince of peace.

Aww, bunny, you know you like
a little controversy.


What'd I tell you about
calling me "bunny" in public?

Let us never discuss that.

-[Stella] okay.
-Agreed.

this is going to be epic!

You on to something, pastor.

your mother would be so proud.

Proud.

Thank you.

[indistinct chatter]

all right, everybody,
let's have a seat.

Now let's talk about
this jamboree.

We goin' to put a little funk
in<i> o come all ye faithful!</i>

[Stella giggling]

-so sorry. Proceed.
-Stella is correct.

We're going to collaborate with
red and his rock band.

And Stella's going
to sing the lead.

-Really?
-Come on, y'all.

Pastor just forgot to turn in
the jamboree paperwork.

-Oh!
-What?

Yes... I...
Okay. Yes, I did.

I did. But god led me to ask
red if we could collaborate.

Not only in memory
of pastor Byrd,

but in the spirit of Christmas,
and he said yes.

We got our own
Christmas miracle.

So on that note, let's jump
on this rehearsal.

Y'all, this is gonna be epic.
I can feel it.

That's right.

Aw, thanks, mom.

Yeah, I feel...
I'm feeling much better.

Uh, oh, I-I got dad's new
golf clubs for Christmas,

and I know every year I ask you
what you want,

but I figured that
I would just gotta...

-[laughing] look at me.
-This is what you bought?

All right, all right, all right.


I'm sorry, mom.
What'd you say?

Yeah, it's gonna be great.

[dramatic music]

hey.

-Hey.
-You look busy.

-Very.
-You okay?

Look, maybe we rushed into this
whole dating thing.

This "all in,
be in the moment" thing.

Whoa, whoa.
Where is this coming from?

I have a lot going on,
and you have the jamboree.

And I really just don't have any
space for more disappointment.

-Disappointment?
-[Olivia] I'm failing here.

This whole trial period thing
is stressing me out.

And dealing with you and another
woman on top of it all...

-Another woman?
-I don't want to talk about it.

I just, I would really
like for you to leave.

-You should let me explain.
-I don't want to hear it.

Everybody is trying
to explain stuff,

and I just really need quiet.

Please.

Okay.

Okay.

<i> â™ª the stars are</i>

Wow! She's beautiful.

You didn't tell me

And this outfit is everything.

-Okay. I see you, big bro.

I see you. [chuckles]

-Excuse me, y'all. Ma!

-[laughing]

Happy holidays.

-Destiny.
-Yeah.

My little sis. She's in town
visiting for the holidays.

That's what I was
trying to tell you.

Yeah...

I'm so sorry.

Um, I'm glad you came.

-I got this for you.
-Thank you.

Oh. Ah, wh-where are my manners?

Please, um, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

-Eat, play, enjoy.
-Uh-hmm. All right, all right.

[miss dee sighs]

-well?
-It was his sister.

-That's the other woman?
-Yes.

I thought you knew
his sister was in town.

I didn't know
his mother was his mother.

I didn't know
sister ida was his aunt.

I did not know
he had a sister.

-[laughing]
-it's not funny.

Olivia, that man is
crazy about you.

Can't you see that?

Before you arrived, no one
could get him to play.

-And believe me, we tried.
-[laughs]

but you opened him up again.

miss dee, livi. Come on.

Pastor, come on.

Oh. No, thanks. I got it.

You didn't open it.

-Oh. Right now? [laughs]
-mm-hm.

Okay.

It's gorgeous.

My grandmother thought that
every Christmas tree

should be topped
with a black angel.

Said it was the ancestors
watching over us.

She's beautiful.

I should go.

Yeah, I-I'm pretty exhausted.

So... Oh.

You were amazing tonight.


[door closes]

if this ain't
the silliest get up.


Jesus is the reason.

Ah. Look who is
in the Christmas spirit.

Where are the other two
of the three wise men?

Oh, they already left.

You know, pastor, thank you
for asking me to help you.

Lord knows I needed a
break from ida.

but, no, truthfully.

It's been really nice
spending some time with you,

just to get to know you.

You good people.

Now, how many of these meals
we deliver in this season?

-Uh, about 300.
-Aw, now, that's good, pastor.

That's 50 more than last year.

Pastor Byrd would be proud.

Mm-hm.

Yes!

I got it.

I did it! I did it!

Olivia. [laughs]

-yes.
-Yeah. We won't discuss that.

What? I can bust a move.

-No. [chuckles]
-boy.

-Are you free tonight?
-Yes.

All right.

-You saw all of that?
-All of that.

-[Olivia] da... [grunts]
-[Ashton laughing]

[instrumental music]

my dad brought my mom here
on their first date.

He was low on cash
and didn't want her to know,

so he packed a nice little
dinner and brought her here.

She thought he was
such a romantic.

Fell in love with him
that night.

Now, that's a love story.

Speaking of love stories...

Would you care to join me?

[both chuckle softly]

come on.


It's absolutely stunning.

You did all this?

I got them skills.

-[chuckles]
-no, this event company did it.

I figured I'd kick it up a
notch... 'cause I ain't broke.



You believed in me.

Reignited my passion for music.

For that, thank you.

I know you're a woman of god.

A pastor, you need to be
out front leading,

and I'm with that.

But I want to be on this
journey with you...

Standing right beside you,
making you laugh.

My mother fell in love
with my father because...

He saw Etta, not a pastor.

She said...

"if you fall in love,
make sure he sees you."

I do.

-[cellphone ringing]
-oh.

Hey, mom.

How...

Wait, what happened?

Slow down.

Oh, no.

All right.
I'll be right there.

-Gosh.
-Everything okay?

No, it's not.

we need to get to the theatre.

the commotion about?

Stella done lost her voice.

what happened.

We tried giving her
tea and honey, mints.

-[Carl] nothing worked.
-Okay, okay. Nobody panic.

I'm not panicking,
so no one needs to panic.

-[Olivia] right.
-All right?

-A-are you panicking?
-No.

Does-does anyone else
know her solo?

Nobody can hit those high notes
like Stella.

I know her solo.
I can do it.

-Oh, lord...
-[sighs]

I'd rather hear a distressed
billy goat cry.

Brother Carl!

Oh, you will know the truth,

and the truth will set you free.

Okay, son, what are we gonna do?

The jamboree is tomorrow.

It's tomorrow.

[instrumental music]

I know where this is going,
and it's a hard no.

-Pastor...
-[Olivia] no.

-The congregation needs you.
-Okay, don't do this.

-Look, you got to go on.
-Stop it.

-[Olivia] just stop it, okay?
-Now's the time to lead.

Please, stop asking me.
Don't ask me again.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

-What the...
-You wanted that.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey, hey.

-I didn't mean to upset you.
-Yeah, well, you did.

And you embarrassed me.

Don't you think I want to be
there for the church?

-Save my job?
-Livi...

That's what they want, right?
A singing pastor.

I-I... I don't sing.

-Yes, you do.
-I cannot be "all in" like you.

-I'm not wired that way.
-Yes, you are.

What do you say to the
congregation every Sunday?

"let your faith be bigger
than your fears."

-not now, Ashton.
-Absolutely now, livi.

Look, that choir,
they need you.

I need you.

Now I'm sorry that choir
director embarrassed you,

hurt you, but now, you get to
stand up to her.

And I told you
I've got your back.

Even if it means
giving you a push.

A push?

Yes, out of your comfort zone,

and into your greatness.

"all in." remember?

Come on, let's sing.

Look how wonderful
this event looks.

Yes. My Christmas joy
just went up a notch.

uh...

I don't, I don't see livi.
Should we try calling her?

No, she's probably backstage
praying over the choir.

Plus, I want it to be a surprise
when she sees us.

Yes. Well, come on.
Let's grab our seats.

-[Corrine] any news?
-No.

She's not answering
her phone either.

Did you go by the house?

I think we should just
give her some space.

She will show up.

Hey, guys.
They say we're on.

All right, everybody,
I know we are nervous,

but we didn't come this far
to turn back now.

Let your faith be bigger
than your fears.

-Let's sing tonight, choir!

Come on, sister ida,
let's go find our seats.

Don't you mess this up
for Jesus.

yeah!
Yes! Yes!

That was electrifying! I knew
you had your mama's voice!

Oh, we were a hit, honey.

And you knew about this voice?

Uh, my god. My god.

Pastor, girl, you are right
with me. You are right with me.

And, pastor, we'll see you
in the new year.

You were amazing!

Your voice!

Oh, yeah. About that.

I may have lied.

When I overheard you at the
church, I knew you had to sing.

-I cannot believe you.
-[Stella chuckles]

-you better sing!
-Oh!

-Livi!
-Sweetheart!

When did you get here? Hi.

Oh, my goodness!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

My singing pastor!
I knew you had it!

I knew you could do it, too,
baby girl.

-Mom, dad, this is...
-Ashton.

I'm so glad to finally meet you.

[Ashton chuckling]

young man, you did a fantastic
job with this choir.

Thank you.

And those voices,
they need to go on the road.

You know, I was thinking
the same thing.

-First stop, Chicago.
-Absolutely.

Uh, do you mind if I have a word
with Olivia?

Yeah, sure.
Go ahead, son.

Thank you. Excuse us.


The church needed me.
I couldn't let them down.

You needed me.
I couldn't let you down.

You know, you got to be
"all in."

-oh. [chuckles]
-[laughing]
