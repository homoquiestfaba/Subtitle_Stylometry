After the bombing of Pearl Harbor
on the 7th of December 1941

The imperial Japanese navy steamed south.
unleashing their fire on Darwin.

A city in the northern
territory of Australia.

The territory' was a land of crocodiles,
cattle barons and warrior chiefs where

Adventure and romance was a way of life.

It was also a place where
Aboriginal children of mixed-race

Were taken by force from their families
and trained for service in white society.

These children became known as
the stolen generations.

Make me into white fellow.

But they not coppers.

And the first time, I saw her.

That Mrs. Boss.

The strangest woman I've ever seen.

She's not from this land.

This land...my people
got many names for it.

But white fellows called it...

Australia.

But this story not begin that day.

This story begin a little while ago.

In a land far far away.

That land called England.

My husband must
sell Faraway downs.

But the offer from this
cattle king of Mr. Carney -

Is only 1/6 what
it once worth.

We need
the money, Ramsden.

Maitland is just about
to muster the pets.

What?

they be getting big cows
ready for market.

Ramsden. You and I both know
there is only one reason...

My husband spend so
much time Down under.

And did has absolutely
nothing to do with cows.

At least not
the animal variety.

Lady Ashley i, i do
Think that bit harsh.

Oh Ramsden
drink your tea.

Lady Ashley.

What do you
intend to do?

I intend to travel
to this cattle station.

Sell it.

And bring Maitland
home to myself.

But Lady Ashley...

It`s Australia.

Darling Sarah employ
you do not travel.

Outbreak of war
imminent. Stop.

Maitland, your concern
regarding war truly noted. Stop.

Have plan concerning cattle, sale

Lady Sarah Ashley..

Genuine aristocrat..

Living right here in Darwin.

Administrator.
we are at war.

As the officer in charge of livestock
Purchases for the armed forces.

She's Quite a looker.

I failed to see.

What Lady Sarah Ashley-

Has to do with Carneys Strangle
hold of the beast industry.

Her husband Lord Ashley
Claims his mustering fats.

At faraway downs.

Faraway downs?

Faraway downs.
The only cattle station.

In the whole of the north,

not owned by Leslie King Carney.

Lord Maitland Ashley is
mustering on Faraway downs.

Isn't quite what we
had in mind isn't Neil?

No,i hear you.

Now his missus has
arrived on a flying boat.

Does not Look like they're gonna
sell Faraway downs to me, Neil.

No she won't last.

Delicate English rose
withers in the outback.

Are You with me?

If you must know
im be to met.

By my husband's
trusted man Mr. Drover.

The bloody Drover.

Bring it , yes.

Move this.

Look at my wife and daughter.
Down there given the royal welcome.

My fiance' Neil Fletcher
manages Faraway downs.

Good day.

Bit pale.

Not Bad looking Sheila but
whats the story on the luggage.

Wants to settle down in
the outback does she?

If she stays and Lord actually manage
to get his cattle down on that wharf there,

Then we've got a competitor
for the army contract Neil.

Carney's control of every
cattle station in the north.

Jeopardizes the supplie
of beef to our troops.

But it's a poor war that doesn't
make a decent patriot get rich.

So... I don't want
a single beast.

From Faraway downs
to set a hoof.

On that wharf.

You with me, Neil?

Yeah. nature wiill take its course.

What about the misses?

Now I've have arranged someone
special to give the old scenic route.

Give her a taste of the outback.

Who's taking her?

The Drover.

The Drover?

Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.

I'm Sarah Ashley.

My husband Lord Ashley has
sent a trusted man to collect me.

Mr. Drover.

It seems if he
been way late.

We call her Mrs. Boss

Why would Fletcher
block the water pump?

I don't know,all crasy.
Why fair,all crasy.

Mr. Flynn?

My lady.
Don't get up.

The truth, Mr. Flynn.

This ledger...

which Fletcher had me

keep for the Benefit of your husband..

Is a tale of decline and ruin..

recelent of great gibbon.

There is however another.

kept for benefit of mr Carney..

in which is recorded all the unbranded...

Fat cattle,siphoned
off cross the river.

and into his herd.

And the boy.

he is Fletcher son.

Isn't he?

as with all the things Fletcher
It's impossible to prove anything.

Still, if Carneys
good Christian wife.

Ever come same
conclusion as youself.

Fletcher chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

im going to authorities
and I will been telling them.

Carney is the authority here.

Are you suggesting I
let him steel my cattle.

and buy my property for
fraction what it is worth.

I'm suggesting..

that you continue do
what your husband set out to do.

Drove...

Drove to the Cattle to Darwin.

Would you mind?

I need a drink.
My lady.

Drove, drove the cattle to Darwin...

Sell them to the army,
you break Carney's monopoly...

Use, profits to put
faraway downsback on its feet's.

You go back to London.

You are sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

That was Maitland
said he was doing.

And there no reason
why you can't do the same.

There is just one small problem.

Having dismissed Fletcher
there is no one muscle the cattle.

Drover!

Drover!

Yeah, Drover!

Mr. Drover!
just get bloody brumbys in there..

Hey Drover, you got to
teach me break them horses.

Mr. Drover, I need to speak to you.

Where the hell all the
bloody stockmen, eyh?

That what I need to
speak with you about.

Where's Fletcher!

We disagreed and I
just dismissed him.

Dismissed?
Yes.

What about the cattle`?

it beckys believe, that as he was leaving
you deliberately let the cows out of the...

I don't know what every
you call it and they run off!

Damn!

Do you realize woman
what you have done.

Mr. Drover do not take that tone
with me, thank you very much!

Not take that tone with you, huh?
No

I'm asking woman do you
know what you have done.

I won't get another drove this late into
the season, right. you cost my living.

Can you just round them up.
Round them up, hah,round them up,yeah.

yes, Just go get them.
Fifteen hundred head cattle...

Scattered over million acres,
with just me and two men.

That's a great idea,stupid cow.

Mr. Drover, I was right to dismiss,
Mr. Fletcher on Morale ground.

morale grounds, you are that
again, are you, oh let me guess.

He want to exploit you
did he, fancy you did he.

Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you.

Mr. Fletcher is
working for Mr. Carney

They were pushing the best
of unbranded cattle-

Across the river on to
Mr. Carneys property.

They were stealing!.

There a no surprised there.

No, his a bad man!

Alright, alright.

Look, you can't prove it,  Alright...
Well...

you can't. and you can't
win against Carney.

So just...

take my
advice lady.

Grab king Carney's offering.

And go to hell
back to England

As quickly as possible that way
you make everybody happy.

Especially me.

So you just going
to walk away?

I learned long time ago not
to fight Other people's wars.

Wait! wait! wait!

Mr. Drover, wait! Please, please!
Mr. Drover, please!

Please, please wait!

Listen you said that your
dream was to breed.

Thorough-bred with
with a bush brumby.

If you agree
to help me, I...

I will give you
my Capricornia.

How we going do a drove with
just me and two of my men, huh?

Crikey.

Mom was drovers boy for Fetcher.

Bandy was drovers boy long time ago.

Some white stockmen like to have a aboriginal
woman on the drove to keep them company at night.

They shave their heads make them look like boys
workem like any other stockmen doing a day.

That's a what you call it?

Exploiting them.
Exploiting, yes.
