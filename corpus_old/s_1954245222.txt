SCIENTIST (O.S.): What's
going on in there?

John own memories are
intruding. He's
having a seizure.

Marjorie! Get in there! Now!

<i>REPORTER (V.O.): Senator</i>
<i>Rockford has been identified</i>
<i>as the target...</i>

<i>of an FBI investigation,</i>
<i>involving embezzlement and</i>
<i>accusations of blackmail.</i>

Senator!

I wholeheartedly and
emphatically deny any and all
allegations leveled against me.

<i>REPORTER (V.O.): His attorney</i>
<i>has secured the services</i>
<i>of Mindscape...</i>

the world's top memory
detective agency...

<i>to gather information about his</i>
<i>past and help the FBI with</i>
<i>the investigation.</i>

<i>Memory detectives, as they're</i>
<i>commonly known...</i>

<i>have experienced a resurgence</i>
<i>in recent years...</i>

<i>thanks to the growing number of</i>
<i>cases solved using the remote</i>
<i>viewing technique.</i>

<i>In the early 70 s, the Defense</i>
<i>Intelligence Agency</i>

<i>began conducting top secret</i>
<i>experiments with people with</i>
<i>psychic abilities</i>

<i>to help gather intelligence</i>
<i>for modern warfare.</i>

<i>They came across a</i>
<i>group of ESP's...</i>

<i>that had the ability to access</i>
<i>people's memories</i>

<i>and observe them as they were</i>
<i>experienced in the past</i>
<i>by the subjects.</i>

<i>The findings of memory</i>
<i>detectives do not yet carry</i>
<i>the same weight...</i>

<i>as DNA evidence in court...</i>

<i>but currently prove more</i>
<i>reliable than polygraph tests.</i>

<i>They say, remote viewing is</i>
<i>nothing more than an</i>
<i>elaborate scam...</i>

<i>but the reality is, remote</i>
<i>viewers have been</i>
<i>solving cases...</i>

<i>that have been cold for years.</i>

<i>Most recently, the murder of</i>
<i>child actress Kate Henderson...</i>

<i>was solved by memory</i>
<i>detective John Washington.</i>

( PHONE VIBRATES, RINGS )

Shit.

Hello?

<i>CALLER (ON PHONE) Ah, hello!</i>
<i>Good Morning!</i>

I'm calling about the
house for sale.

No... no... we're not selling
the house anymore, I'm sorry.

Well... the agency listing says
it's still active.

Yeah, I know it's still listed
at the agency, but we're not
selling it, okay?

Mr. Washington's own
traumatic memories...

<i>were blending in with his</i>
<i>clients memories...</i>

<i>which impaired his ability to</i>
<i>focus during sessions.</i>

And thank you.

<i>Now it seems, Senator Rockford</i>
<i>is betting his political</i>
<i>career on Mindscape...</i>

<i>the prime memory detective</i>
<i>agency in the world.</i>

<i>The rumors that the Mindscape</i>
<i>program is dangerous,</i>
<i>are unfounded.</i>

( MUSIC FADES UP )

John is here.

John... how are you?

I'm great.

You're still taking
the medication?

No, I'm done with all that.

Well, you're lucky the
stroke was mild.

You could be relearning your
abc's right now.

That's true.

Yes?

Uh... I'm good.

Nice.

You met anybody recently?

You know, John, maybe it's time
to get back in the running.

I'm not there yet.

It's been two years.

You should move on from what
happened to your wife.

And you know it
wasn't your fault.

Yeah, well--

( PIECES DROPPING ) Oh, shit!
Shit! Sorry.

Ah, don't worry about it.
Don't worry!

I'm so sorry. Don't
worry about it.

I'm sorry.

Here... sit down! Sorry.

I heard Senator Rockford on...
TV...

talking about the possibility
of hiring a memory detective.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Peter Lundgren
is already working on the case.

Rockford hired him. Lundgren?

C mon! I was better than him
on my worst day!

Yeah, but gifts like yours
need to be used.

You've been out of the
game for months.

And Lundgrens' success nowadays
is close to 100 percent.

( GROANS )

What's the matter ?

To be honest, I'm
running out of money.

You still have the beach house?

Yeah.

Go ahead. Sell it.

I'm not ready to sell it yet.

What I was wondering was
whether I could do
something for Mindscape.

As it happens, I, uh...

I might have something you're
right for, perfect actually.

Her name is Anna.

Oh, you're kidding.

Forget about the name, right?

She used to be my patient
when she was little.

Very special girl...

she's a teenager now, but I
don't think a... a
doctor can help.

Maybe a viewer can.

Well, what's her problem?

She's on a hunger strike. All
you have to do is
get her to eat.

Just tell the parents to hide
the fashion magazines.

John...

You know, it could be a quick
one for you, if you didn't
wanna sell the beach house.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

( VOICEMAIL BEEPS )

<i>SEBASTIAN (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi</i>
<i>John, I'm so happy you're</i>
<i>back in the saddle.</i>

<i>Anna's still refusing to eat,</i>
<i>trying to pressure them...</i>

into letting her out
of the house.

She's very fragile, so
tread carefully.

<i>Try to find a trauma for her</i>
<i>therapist to work on... bye.</i>

<i>( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

( MUSIC FADES UP )

Thank you so much for
working on Anna's case.

I'm Michelle. John.

And this is Anna's stepfather,
Robert.

Sebastian speaks very
highly of you.

Even as a baby, Anna
was unusual.

She didn't smile when you
smiled at her, but she didn't
cry much, either.

I would say she was unusually
focused for a child,
always calm.

She looked at things as if she
already knew what they were.

Later, of course, we took her
to a specialist, and her IQ
score came back off the charts.

When was the last time she ate?

She stopped eating
one week ago.

She's taking vitamins and
drinking water, but
nothing else.

In my opinion, she should be...
in a place that can provide
the proper care.

I'm sure Anna can get
better here.

Mr. Washington, ah... as I'm
sure you can appreciate...

this is a matter that requires
great discretion.

I will need you to sign a
non-disclosure contract...

that anything revealed in
Anna's memories can't be
disseminated beyond
Michelle and myself.

Of course.

Anna is so special, she's so
many talents, she's...

Gifted.

Yes, gifted.

I think there are
better words for it.

Such as?

I would say haunted.

What happened to
Anna's real father?

He died... when I was pregnant.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Does Anna get along
with Robert?

Not well, lately... but he's
tried to do his best for her.

I see. This way.

Is there any specific reason
why Anna is refusing to eat?

She wants to go back to school,
but that's impossible.

I'm sure Sebastian told you
about her cutting herself.

We've had to remove all sharp
objects from her room.

We need to protect her.

From what?

To protect her, from herself.

<i>( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

Sweetie. This is John...

the gentleman I told you was
coming to visit.

Aren't you late for your
AA meeting, Mom?

( DOOR CLOSES )

Can I have a seat? Can
I have a seat?

Do you mind? Do you mind?

We won't guess the next one for
sure, so go ahead, make
yourself comfortable.

That's quite the party
trick you have there.

( BEAR DOLL SQUEAKS )

What's the metronome for?

I like the rhythm when I draw.
It's soothing.

Better?

Much.

Anna, you know what
catabolysis is?

If you don't eat, your
organs are gonna fail.

John, do you know what "prana"
is?

It's sanskrit, it
means vital life.

There are Yogis in India
who rarely eat.

They get all their energy or
"prana" from the air
and the sun.

Is that what you're doing?

Are you a doctor?

No, but I do have to ask
you some questions.

I would like you to tell me
what expression you see.

What am I getting in exchange
for making you earn some of
Robert's money?

Well, you might get to know
yourself better.

What do you see?

Malice.

I'm kidding.

He's expressing happiness,
maybe even affection.

What about this guy?

That guy's pissed off.

Uh-huh.

What about her?

I think her husband's out late,
and she's wondering
where he is.

She's worried he's with someone
else, but she's also glad to
have the down time...

'cause he's a loser.

Right.

I'm gonna tell you a story...

and then I'm gonna ask you
a question. Okay?

There's this girl about your
age at her mother's funeral.

At the funeral, she sees this
guy she's never seen before.

She gets to meet him, briefly.

And she thinks he's amazing.
He's everything she's
ever wanted.

She falls in love with him,
right there and then.

But, in the crowds at the
funeral, she gets separated...

from him before she has a
chance to ask for his number.

And two days later... this
girl... kills her own sister.

What's her motive for
killing her sister?

Her motive is she wants to
meet the guy again.

Did I get it right?

Huh? Oh, there's no
right answer.

Depends on what
you're looking for.

Why is that?

You're testing me to see if I
think like a sociopath.

Sociopaths sometimes have
trouble reading
facial expressions.

With the second test, I gave
you the answer you were
looking for...

but, the fact is, that story
has a flawed set up.

The more logical outcome would
be for the girl to
kill her father.

Why?

If the girl didn't know the
man, it's unlikely her
sister would.

And it was her mother's funeral
where she met this guy...

so it would make more sense for
her to kill her father.

There would be a higher
probability that the...

the mystery stud would attend
her father's funeral.

That's probably true.

I'm not a sociopath, just smart
enough to think like one.

Can I see what you're drawing?

If you're not a doctor,
then what are you?

I take people to
their memories.

She's monitored all the time?

24-7.

If you need anything while
you're here, you can ask me or
Ralph, we both watch Anna.

I'm John.

Oh, I'm Judith...
this is my cell.

Call me, if you can't
make a session.

I will.

( SHIP HORN SOUNDS )

You were right about her,
she's smart.

Special kid, lots of problems.

What do you think are the
underlying issues?

Depression, bipolar disorder
with deep-seeded narcissism.

I'm gonna need her full file to
know what memories to target.

Parents don't want
full disclosure.

What? Why? I signed
an agreement!

She's been in and out of
boarding schools, involved in
some incidents...

but you don't need to
get into that.

Just let her take the lead,
you know?

I mean... a few memories where
the parents screw up.

As you know, usually, the
dramatic experience of actually
going back into memories...

affects people, gives them
perspective on their
present lives...

to stop overeating, stop
smoking... whatever.

Make her eat. Simple case.

Will I know I'm in a memory?

It should feel like it's
happening for the first time...

but it'll be different from
the original event.

Because your unconscious mind
will know that you've
been there before.

Also...

me being there makes
it different.

The equipment is useful to
record the session.

( DEVICE WHIRRING )

I will be watching you for
the whole time.

If anything happens, I can
bring you back, right away.
Okay?

Now, you may see me in the
distance, but you won't
know that it's me.

If I'm next to you, you won't
be able to see me at all...

unless I call you back.

Understand?

Yes.

Please put these in your ears.

They conceal a tone, hidden
in white noise.

It enables the brain to go
into a theta state.

Can we use my metronome.
as well?

Uh... sure.

Where are we going?

Focus on your first memory.

The further back we can go,
the better.

Give me your hands.

Relax.

Think about that first memory.

At first, your memories will
jump around, but that's okay.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

When you're ready...

close your eyes.

Let's begin...

now.

I like you being
here with us...

We all know you like girls.

She's just a girl
for god sakes!

We have a responsibility!

Let me out!

She needs to be in an
institution!

She's my daughter!

This old man, he played three.

He played
knick-knack on my knee.

With a knick-knack
paddy whack...

give a dog a bone...

( DOOR OPENS ) this old man
came rolling home.

( CLOCK CHIMING )

What game are you playing,
honey?

Can I play with you?

You have to be quiet.

What are you up to?

( RETCHING )

Mommy's not feeling well today.

You can't do that! You
can't just...

We have to think about Anna.
Anna is the focus of
the attention.

Don't you think I'm
thinking about her?

We have a responsibility! We
are not the right people!

This is not the place for her,
Michelle!

Come with me, young lady! Dad!
Let me down!

( SCREAMS )

I'll let you out when you
realize that spying on
people is wrong.

For god's sakes,
She's only a girl!

She's different, Michelle.

She's not like other children,
she needs to be in an
institution.

Well, why isn't it here, then?
Because I put it in here.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

She's my daughter.

She tried to stab you, for
Christ's sakes!

Mom!

And coming back... now.

( GASPS )

Ow.

Are you okay?

You were there?

I was right next to you.

Spooky.

Can we do more?

Next time.

Self-involved, emotionally
stunted retards is what one
hopes for in parents.

Did you see the letter opener?

I did.

Maybe my stepdad is the one you
should be testing for
personality disorders.

Is he why you're on a
hunger strike?

So you married?

I was.

What was her name?

Same as yours.

I like her already.

Show me a picture.

I don't carry one anymore.

C'mon, John.

A guy like you always has a
picture in his wallet.

I'll show you a picture...

if you agree to eat something.

You wanna see her?

It's up to you.

Robert desperately wants
to put me away.

And something like LSD in my
food would make me act crazy.

Well then, let's flip
out together.

If I start hallucinating,
you'll demand a drug test...

before they lock me away in a
padded room, right?

I swear.

C mon, let's eat!

She's pretty.

<i>Eat slowly so you don't</i>
<i>make yourself sick.</i>

Why do you wanna see this
antique letter opener?

I like to confirm memories,
just to be sure.

I cut her accidentally.

It's always haunted me.

Is your husband here? Mm-hm.

Can I talk to you both?

Why?

Anna just started to eat.

JUDITH (O.S.): So, will I see
you at 7:00 to celebrate?

Okay, shall I pick you up then?

Sure, why not?

But only one drink.

( ENGINE STARTS )

So you like being a nurse?

I like helping people.

You take your job quite
seriously, huh?

Well, if you can't do what you
love, then at least make sure
you love what you do.

Isn't that what they say?

They do say that, that is
absolutely true.

I think you're doing a
great job with Anna.

Thank you for your confidence.

Sometimes I don't think I'm
gonna be able to help her.

Why?

My wife and I had a baby boy...

who died a few months
after he was born.

My wife kept wanting to go back
to the time when he was
still alive, and...

eventually the time
came when...

she wasn't happy unless she
was in the memory.

She became obsessed.

So, I refused to take her to
the past anymore.

She... spiraled downward,
she... became depressed
and I lost her.

I couldn't help her.

I tried to keep her in the
house, but you can't
lock someone up...

just because of your own fears.

I had a great time.

Me, too.

I hope I didn't talk too much.
Oh, you did...

but I liked it.

Thank you.

So, you're not even gonna try
to come up, so I can say no?

Uh...

I gotta go.

Safe home.

GIRL (WHISPERING): It's not
your fault, John!

GIRL (WHISPERING): It's not
your fault, John!

<i>( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

I'm telling you, Sebastian, I
saw her last night.

SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE):
That's impossible.

<i>She's under lock and key, never</i>
<i>allowed to leave her room.</i>

I know, but I... I
know what I saw.

<i>Do you, John? Is</i>
<i>everything all right?</i>

Everything's fine.

( DOOR OPENS )

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

We may have one, because
there are blind spots.

What's happened?

Anna pushed Judith
down the stairs.

Judith is in the hospital with
multiple fractures.

Look at this.

Oh, my god!

There's no other angle at the
top of the stairs?

Blind spot.

On Monday, Anna will be
confined to an institution...

that can properly
address her needs.

Fortunately, as a family
friend, Judith will not be
pressing any charges.

I didn't do it, John.

Then why would Judith
say you did?

Judith always sneaks back
in late at night.

Mom's knocked-out on sleeping
pills, and that's when
they have sex.

Who? Robert and Judith?

He always sleeps with the
good looking help.

Just ask Jaime.

I mean, you saw what she was
doing with Robert in
the library.

I don't believe you.

When she first came here,
Judith had tried to make
friends with me.

And she was all like, "I have
no luck with men".

Well, my stepfather
moved right in.

You know, maybe-- maybe they
had a fight, it got violent...

and now they're trying to cover
it up by blaming it on
the sick girl.

Or maybe Robert just
cold-bloodedly pushed her,
okay?

This is exactly the kind of
thing he's been hoping
for to lock me up.

Oh, c'mon, Anna.

Open your eyes, John!

My mother's family is one of
the richest in America.

And Robert's on an allowance.

If I die, the money goes to a
charitable trust and
he gets zilch.

But if I'm committed...

I get the money, but I
have no rights.

Robert controls every penny.

And I'm sure Judith knows this.

Maybe he was afraid that she
was gonna tell you and that
you'd find out his
secret plans.

And I'm sure he told you, only
moments ago, that they send me
to an institution on Monday.

Am I right?

Please, John, you have to help
me prove that I'm innocent.

You're the only person
they're gonna trust.

I-- I can't get send away to a
mental institution.

I won't survive that.

I know-- I know I'm different,
not like other girls...

but doesn't mean
I'm a murderer.

I don't even-- I don't even
think of doing half the things
they're accusing me of!

Please, John!

Help me figure out what the
hell's going on with me.

I mean, you're all I have.

( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )

John.

How do you feel?

Pretty out of it.

Judith, did you see... Anna
push you down the stairs?

Are you here for
Anna or for me?

I'm here for you.

But I need to know
what happened.

I know I went to bring
her some food.

I thought I locked the door.

Why don't you go to my memory?

Ah... doesn't work like that.

How do you know it
wasn't Robert?

Robert?

Judith, I know.

Know what?

I know about you and Robert.

Did he hit on me?

Whatever, doesn't matter.

There's nothing going on
between me and Robert.

Look, I...

I hope you get better soon.

I can't believe that Anna
would hurt Judith.

Can you help my daughter, John?

I believe I can, Mrs. Greene.

I can take her to her traumatic
memories, help her
understand her behavior.

( DOOR OPENS )

And I wanna find out the truth.

My husband wants to send her to
a professional care facility.

I don't want that, but he's
already paid the
registration fee...

and they're expecting
her in a week.

As soon as I see that file,
I'll know what I should
be looking for.

I'll have Sebastian's assistant
send it to you right away.

Sebastian has it?

( THUNDER ROLLING )

<i>SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE): You'll</i>
<i>see why the family didn't want</i>
<i>you to see the file.</i>

<i>It's strong stuff, John.</i>

You said this was a
simple case.

<i>And it should have been, John.</i>

Maybe you're not ready
to come back.

Look... they're gonna put Anna
in an institution.

If you'd sent me the file
earlier, maybe I could have
prevented all this.

<i>Are you sure you want to</i>
<i>continue with the case?</i>

I'm Anna's best hope right now.

I'll call you in a
couple of days.

<i>( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

<i>Do you know why you're here,</i>
<i>Anna?</i>

That's pretty obvious.

<i>For just one day, can we talk</i>
<i>about something other than me?</i>

<i>What made you try to</i>
<i>kill yourself?</i>

Red...

<i>it's such a dark, rich color.</i>

<i>Particular shade, it's</i>
<i>hard to come by.</i>

<i>Blood... it's red.</i>

It's kind of beautiful.

<i>Can you tell me about your</i>
<i>relationship with your parents?</i>

<i>My mother's trying harder, I</i>
<i>suppose, but it's still</i>
<i>pretty pathetic.</i>

<i>Her heart's like... one of</i>
<i>those fancy ice sculptures</i>
<i>they have at parties.</i>

<i>Do you really want to know</i>
<i>the answer? Please.</i>

It's my parents who are
crazy... not me.

<i>Did you have feelings for your</i>
<i>teacher? Mr. Tatum?</i>

<i>That school was depressing.</i>
<i>He was nice.</i>

Did he take pictures of you?

<i>MR. ORTEGA (V.O.): Would you</i>
<i>mind if I take a</i>
<i>picture of you?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>What kind of pictures?</i>

Artistic photos.

( CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING )

It was like a Jackson
Pollock painting...

where the blood sprayed
across the floor.

I can still see the exact
pattern when I close my eyes.

<i>Do you want to die, Anna?</i>

Don't we all die in the end?

It's kind of a freedom.

There are other
ways to be free.

Not if you're not
allowed to have it.

Then what do you do?

Will you lift your chin a bit?

How do you feel when you draw?

Like the whole
world disappears.

Like nothing else matters.

All right, finished.

Can I see it?

Not yet.

Can I have your bag?

Promise me you'll look at it
when you get home?

I promise.

Are we even now?

Can we start the session?

Yeah, we can.

( HIGH-PITCHED TONE )

Mousey? It's
extremely dangerous.

My real name is Megan Scanlon.

Who you raping ', bitch?

( BELL RINGS ) ( GIRL SCREAMS )

Hi, I'm Mousey.

Mousey? That's
really your name?

It's what the people
here call me.

My real name is Megan,
Megan Scanlon.

So Susan Merricks
your roommate.

What's she really like?

I heard she was training for
the Olympics, had a
nervous breakdown...

( DOOR OPENS ) beat up a
horse or something.

Oh, great! Frigid and
Mousey are here.

Look, just because I've been
assigned to watch over you...

doesn't mean you have to be in
the room all the time, Frigid.

Name's Anna.

Capital A, N, N, A.

Leave.

Now.

Or maybe the reason you won't
go is because you wanna
watch me changing.

Right, Frigid?

What are you doing? No! No! No!
Please don't!

No! No! No! Stop!

( SCREAMS )

Cameras will be locked up, and
can only be signed out for
a day at a time.

The chemicals you will be using
could be harmful...

and any misuses, however
slight, will end your
art privileges.

Now, who here has experience
with the art of photography?

Anna.

Someone broke into the
principal's house and stole
all the alcohol.

Do you know who might
have done this?

House Mother, you're
talking to someone...

who takes the harmful effects
of alcohol very seriously.

Drinking is the Devil's
calling card.

( BELL RINGS )

Hey, Anna, look.

I'm so, so sorry about
the closet. I--

Oh, don't worry about it.

Some friends are coming over to
tea tomorrow. Do you
want to join us?

Can Megan come?

What, Mousey? She's
such a retard.

Yeah, she is.

Do you copy your roses from the
rose bushes out there?

Roses don't grow
during the winter.

Sometimes we remember things
the way we want to, rather than
the way they really were.

I didn't do anything to those
girls, if that's what
you're implying.

False memories can have a... a
rushed feeling to them...

a lack of detail.

The windows won't have views or
none of the clocks will work.

Well, if you ever find me, ah,
particularly attractive
in a memory...

it's probably because I'm
making it up, too.

I wouldn't picture myself
having a bad skin day if I
knew you'd be around.

Hey, I'm not kidding, okay?

I can accept we don't exactly
know what we're looking for...

but your memories
have to be real!

You have to be very careful!

Has something told you I've
been making them up?

Yeah, I saw a clock on the
wall, the hands weren't moving.

The one in the dorm hallway,
right?

Yeah.

That one never worked.

We used to call our gym
teacher, Mr. Pierce "The
Clock", because he didn't work,
either.

You never leave the house,
right?

Not anymore.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

( MUSIC CHANGES )

You've got 20 minutes.

Mr. Ortega?

So, what are you? Some
kind of therapist?

Do you know what a
memory detective is?

Somebody who takes rich
people's money.

Well, that's me.

Has Anna's family hired you to
find out if she has a soul?

I'm just here to find
out the truth.

That family is a nightmare.

You dig too deep, better
watch your step.

You're lucky you didn't get 20
years for seducing a minor.

I'm not saying I wasn't at
fault, but that girl...

that girl was everywhere I
turned... flirting...

finding ways to get us alone.

I've lost everything.

My job, my fiance,
my freedom...

my entire fucking life,
because of her.

Anna's family throws money
around like confetti.

They can get to anybody.

Cops, district attorneys...

They've covered up all the bad
stuff Anna's done.

Then, had me thrown in here for
something I didn't do.

I'm sure that they even covered
it up when she tried to kill...

those three girls at school
that same year.

Anna blamed it all on
another girl, Mousey...

but no one could find
out who she was.

Not even Susan Merrick s family
was able to take Anna to court.

I'd love that family to finally
get what's coming to them.

Susan Merrick?

My name is John Washington. Can
I ask you a few questions
about Anna Greene?

Are you a cop?

No, I'm not a cop, Ms. Merrick.

What? Has she died
or something?

No... not at all.

I just want to find out what
happened, what really happened
at the Whitten Academy.

You think Anna was responsible.

Of course, she was a
total psycho.

There were a lot of other girls
there with problems. Could
have been anyone.

I got on with everyone.

Did you have a girl named
Mousey at your school?

No... I don't think so.

Now, I'm sorry, but
I have to go.

Miss Merrick, I know what
you've been through.

I know it must have been
extremely painful.

I really need your help.

Do you have any specific memory
of Anna you think I
should know?

Yeah... sure I do.

<i>( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

Anna seriously has balls. She
was like "drinking is the
Devil's calling card".

It was awesome.

Hey, Anna, do you want a cup?

No, thanks.

You sure?

Yeah.

I like you being here with us.

And coming back... now.

ANNA (O.S.): You saw Mousey,
right? She did it.

So you didn't poison
those girls?

Of course, not.

Your prints were all
over the teapot.

Because I picked it up
once or twice.

And why would I wipe the poison
clean, but leave my
prints on the teapot?

Not to mention hiding the
poison under my bed.

Maybe you're too smart
for your own good.

If you'd wiped the pot, that
would point to you.

Maybe you just didn't have time
to hide the poison.

It was Megan, John.

Why didn't you go to the cops?

What, and tell them that Megan
was obsessed and that she
smirked at me as I
was led away?

Why not?

You're forgetting what it's
like to be a teenager.

Adults telling you what to do,
having opinion about what you
say, before you even say it.

There's no Mousey, Anna. What?

What are you talking about?

There's no Megan at the school.

Oh, you don't believe me?
Do you blame me?

Megan transferred in during the
second semester and left right
after I got expelled.

You know, who the hell do
you think I am?

Please tell me, John!

What... what, you think I'm
some psychopath?

What? This is the second day in
a row you've called me a liar!

I want to know why you're
suddenly turning on me!

Here! My yearbook!

ANNA (O.S.): Asshole.

You won't mind if I hang on to
this for a couple of days?

Sleep with it under your
pillow, for all I care.

We don't have much time.

I want you to think about all
the key moments in your
life by tomorrow.

Can you do that for me?

Fine.

What are you doing in here?

You know, Mr. Greene, it really
isn't necessary to
have me followed.

I had you extensively looked
into before you were hired.

I don't have anyone
following you now.

And now, if you'd be so kind,
your work in this
house is upstairs.

( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )

Very nice, Anna.

Not just yet.

( MUSIC FADES UP )

Glad you're back from
zombie land.

You okay, want some water?

Aren't they great? Better than
what you had before.

How did you do that?

I just downloaded it.

No, how did you leave me
alone in the memory?

I don't know.

Suddenly I was back here, and
our hands were separated, but
you were still under.

I wasn't sure what to do.

You looked cute while you
were sleeping.

Anna, do you know what
transference is?

I do.

Then you'll know it's
perfectly natural to--

To what? Have strong feelings
for your therapist?

I just simply said I liked
watching you sleep.

Your teacher was a lot older
than you, he took advantage.

He was encouraging... that
place was so depressing.

What about the photos?

He said they were for art, and
at first they were artistic.

<i>( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

You okay? You don't
look too good.

I'm having trouble
staying grounded.

Side-effects from the sessions?
Hallucinations?

Yeah... terrible headaches.

I can't sleep... nightmares.

Plus the guy they've hired
to follow me...

he's... he is everywhere I go.

Maybe events have made this
case far bigger than you were
ready for when you started.

Maybe we should ask
Lundgren to take over.

No! No way, no. I
can handle it.

Did you ever treat Anna
at their house?

No.

Did you ever have reason to
suspect abuse
within the family?

Nothing with the stepfather?

Highly unlikely. I mean, look,
Robert's a prominent guy.

I wouldn't go down that road
based on a hunch.

Tom Ortega told me Anna's
parents set him up for--

You went to see Tom Ortega?

That lowlife took dirty
pictures of Anna.

You should be focusing on the
sessions, not investigating
in the real world.

You need to be objective, John.

There is something going on
there behind the scenes...

I need to find out what it is.

You need to consider that this
job is too big and
too complex...

and that you are becoming too
personally involved.

Whatever it is, I'm gonna
find out the truth.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

Do you know where
you want to go?

I went through all the photos
and one of them made me
feel something.

Don't tell me.

Don't corrupt the memory,
just go there.

When you're ready,
close your eyes.

Let's begin... now.

My parents brought him to me.
Who?

I don't remember his name.

( CLOCK CHIMES )

This old man, he played three.

He played
knick-knack on my knee.

With a knick-knack paddy whack,
give a dog a bone.

This old man came rolling home.

<i>( OMINOUS MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

( WOOD BLOCKS CLANKING )

What are you doing over there,
Anna?

Why don't you come here...
next to me.

Come here, sweetheart.

Don't be afraid.

( BREATHING HEAVILY )

I won't hurt you.

And coming back... now!

Anna?

( STEPS APPROACHING ) ( DOOR

( DOOR OPENS, STEPS

You're okay, you fainted.

RALPH (O.S.): What happened?

Can you get some water.
She's okay.

RALPH (O.S.): Yeah, sure.

Take this.

What is it?

It's a bit of one of your mom's
sedatives. It'll
help you sleep.

So, what happens now?

Now... you get better.

( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )

This is the key to the house my
parents lived in
when I was born.

I always felt safe there.

So many times in my life
people have been unkind.

I can't thank you enough, John.

Will you keep this with
you at all times?

If I know you have it, then at
least I know that there's
someone out there...

who's on my side.

I might not be going to
an institution...

but I still feel trapped.

Sure.

( THUNDER ROLLING )

Hey! Hey!

John? What are you doing here?

You should have called, I've
got dinner guests.

Why Sebastian?

Christ! She was just a child.

What's going on? You've
been drinking?

These were in Anna's memories.

Have you been in my office?

I've seen you with her, in the
library, in one of
the memories.

Oh, I might have been there
once, I forgot!

What's this all about?

You said you never treated her
at the house, but
you were there!

Are you trying to say I did
something to her?

Think this through, John.

Why would I ask you to take on
a case, if I was guilty
of something?

Think about what it is you're
accusing me of...

then, think about who it is
you're accusing.

They wanted to hire
Peter Lundgren.

You brought me in, because I
was down, and I was weak...

and I was easy to manipulate.
Right?

And you wouldn't let me see
that file until you
absolutely had to.

You said they didn't want me to
see it, but you had it
the whole time!

I never told you I didn't
have the file!

I said the family
wanted privacy.

What about the other day? Ah?
You wanted me to drop the case.

I said that because--

Now... I know what you didn't
want me to find out.

I said that because I was
worried about you!

Oh, c'mon, John!

You've been drinking alone.
Having hallucinations for days!

You're ignoring me again,
Uncle Sebastian

Hi, sweetheart.

Sorry. John--

Don't you ever go near Anna
again! You hear me?

John!

John!

JOHN (O.S.): Due to Anna's
early overt sexualization...

she has a need for control...

which manifests itself in a
variety of disorders.

She has... significant
difficulty...

in forming and maintaining
long-term
relationships with others.

Basically, she has developed a
protective shell...

Do you like it? which keeps
out the pain...

and keeps out everything else.
It's great.

She interacts with the world in
a completely different way
than the way we do.

Locking her up is the worst
possible thing you could do.

Thank you so much, Mr.
Washington.

Good luck.

up, Mr. Washington!

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

DETECTIVE (O.S.): You're
suspected of murder, Mr.
Washington.

We found hundreds of pictures
featuring underage girls...

in your computer.

She set me up.

A 16 year-old girl.

Look. We know the parents were
constantly threatening to send
the girl to an institution...

and that you... strongly
disagreed with that.

So the way I see it, you got
too close to the girl.

You drugged the parents, so you
could take her away...

but she refused to go and you
end up doing something you'd
never think you
were capable of.

The parents are okay?

Yeah... we found the mother's
sleeping pills in the kitchen,
John.

And I'd be willing to bet that
your fingerprints are all over
that prescription bottle.

We found a letter opener,
covered in blood...

in the forest, where you were.

I can explain every peace of
evidence you think you have.

We're carefully going through
the tapes of you chasing Anna.

Now obviously you disabled a
number of the cameras...

and then turned the power off
to cover your tracks.

I was locked inside the
surveillance room!

Recognize this?

Anna gave me that.

It's the key to the
surveillance room.

You panicked,
needed an alibi...

so you damaged the interior of
the door, but you forgot...

that you had the key
in your pocket.

Do the right thing, John...

and tell me what you did
with the girl.

I went to the house, I was
looking for her.

And you got locked in the
surveillance room.

Exactly. And when I got out,
it was too late.

And there was blood on the
floor in the hallway, I
followed the trail
to the forest!

And that's how you got the
blood on your shoes? Yes.

By following the trail of blood
from a 16 year-old... in a
massive forest.

Yes, and... she came
out of nowhere.

She... she grabbed my hands, my
hands had blood on them.

She ran away.

And was this before or after
she called 911 on her cell...

screaming and crying that you
were chasing her through the
house, trying to kill her?

There is plenty of evidence
to convict you.

There was someone else there.

You're gonna die in jail.

( CLOCK TICKING )

And coming back... now.

<i>( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

<i>ANNOUNCER (V.O.): End of move,</i>
<i>end of move!</i>

Okay, that's it.

We visited all the necessary
memories together...

through every aspect of your
involvement in Anna's case.

I should have realized
what she was doing.

It's not your fault, John.

Anna was able to study our
protocols during your
time with her...

and she eventually became
strong enough to control and
manipulate the sessions.

She was even able to figure out
that water triggered the
memories of your
wife's suicide.

She needed you to be
responsible for her death.

If she just ran away, her
parents would just keep
searching for her.

Did you find anything?

I'll submit our sessions
to the judge...

specifically highlighting the
time you were locked in the
surveillance room...

and when you spoke to her
in the forest...

but as you know, our sessions
don't yet carry the
same weight...

as eye witness
testimony in court.

The only irrefutable evidence
you could have is proving
Anna's still out there...

but... that's something
beyond my capabilities.

( STEPS APPROACHING )

Mr. Lundgren?

( SOFT MUSIC FADES UP )

( DOOR BUZZES )

I'm so sorry.

I don't know how she made
me believe her.

She had me completely fooled.

It's all good, John.

You've been under a lot of
pressure lately.

Thank you.

The judge is gonna consider
Peter's testimony for sure...

but since you both work
for Mindscape...

there are some legal issues we
need to get over and
that'll take time.

I know.

Now... the sooner you get rid
of the house the better.

It won't take long before the
bail will be granted.

But don't worry, John,
you're not alone.

I'm gonna do everything in my
power to help you get
clear of this.
