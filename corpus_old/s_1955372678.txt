Are you following me?

Um... no?

Um, what are you doing?

I live here.

No. I live here.

No. 3715.

Really?

See?

Um, excuse me?

Uh...

This is my house.

No.
Listen this is<i> my</i> house.

We know each other.

Oh.

I don't know you.

We must have lost our memories.

Well...

I wonder how we're gonna get
those back.

Well... obviously,
we should have sex

and just hope for the best.

Wait.
What?

What if we're brother
and sister?

You're ruining this.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm gonna go to bed.

Okay.
I'll be in in a little bit.

No, come now.

Okay.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Hey.

Hmm?

I really do.

Good.

Hey, will you grab the light?

Hey, babe?

Man on TV:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

<i>This team doesn't care
about winning.</i>

<i>They're thinking about one thing</i>

<i>and that is the draft.</i>

<i>I'm not saying they're tanking,</i>

<i>but the last thing
they want is a win.</i>

<i>This team's hope for the future</i>

<i>is on draft day.</i>

Hey, babe.
Where are you?

I don't remember what you said
you were doing today,

but call me, okay?

All right.
Love you.

Hi, Darcy?

Listen, have you spoken
with Claire today?

Okay.

No, no, everything's fine.

I just don't know where she is.

I'm sure she told me
and I'm just forgetting.

<i>And, hey, listen,
if you hear from her,</i>

<i>could you... okay, great.</i>

<i>Thanks, see ya.</i>

<i>Hey, Mr. York, sorry.</i>

It's David, Claire's boyfriend?

Is she working today?

She works tomorrow, not today.

All right.
And you haven't seen her?

<i>No.</i>

Claire?
Hey, what the fuck?

Sorry, I'm looking for Claire.
Have you seen her?

You ruined my prints, man!
Have you seen her?

<i>No!</i>

Shit.

Man: <i>Did you guys have a
fight before she left?</i>

No, everything was fine.
And what about recently?

Did you guys have
any disagreements?

David:
<i>No.</i>

Man: <i>Have you...
Have you called her parents?</i>

Claire?

David: <i>She doesn't have
any family, actually.</i>

Man: <i>Okay. And you've
spoken to her friends?</i>

Yes, I've spoken to her friends.

Because sometimes people
don't even realize

something was wrong.
Nothing was was wrong, all right?

<i>- We're happy, so...
Okay.</i>

David: <i>Okay, well,
what... what should I do?</i>

Man:
<i>Anything helps.</i>

<i>You know, reach out to people
that know her.</i>

<i>If this isn't resolved
in a few days,</i>

<i>we'll get you a printout
of the report.</i>

A lot of people like to flyer
the neighborhood,

you know, telephone poles
and everything.

Whoa, wait, wait.
Flyer the neighborhood?

<i>That's it?
Listen, hopefully,</i> it won't come to that.

<i>Okay, I promise you, we're
gonna do everything we can.</i>

Are you following me?

What?

No.

Of course not.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You live here?

Uh, yeah.

Oh, that's embarrassing.

I'm sorry.

Don't worry about it.

You know,
it's just that for a second,

I thought
you were gonna kill me.

Wow, well,

I definitely would not do that.

I know,
you're probably like a...

Like a school teacher
or something.

No, I'm not a school teacher.

But... I like to think
I'm a pretty good guy.

Yeah, I can see that<i> now.</i>

I'm Claire.

David.

Hi, David,
I just moved into 103.

The twisted sister fan.

Oh.

I'm in 203, right above you.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I can make it up to you.

I can get you a gift
or something.

Oh, really?
Yeah!

No, listen,
I'm kidding, seriously.

I mean, you can get me gifts,
by all means,

but don't worry about it.

Welcome to the building, Claire.

Hey, David.
Hi, Colleen.

How you doin'?

I'm... I'm good.

Well, I really hate
to do this to you,

but I really can't wait
any longer.

I'm so sorry.

It's, you know,
if it were up to me...

I understand.

Okay.

All right, see ya.

Hello?

Sorry for dropping in
without any warning.

I didn't think I was gonna be
here more than an hour.

Don't worry about it.
It's good to see you.

It's nice to actually talk
to someone who really knew her.

It's...
It's been too long.

I know, I know.
I'm sorry about that.

How have you been doing?

Just the same, you know?

It's just... it...

It's too brutal, man, you know?

It's... it's unreal.

Yeah, you know,
best-case scenario

is that she just left.

And cops said that happens.

That's the easiest thing
for me to imagine.

I mean, the...
You know, the least painful.

'Cause it's either that
or she...

Was killed, or she was taken.

Shit.
Yeah.

So, there were never
any leads or anything?

No.

Do you think
it's possible that...

You know, that she was unhappy?

Fuck, man.

I mean, she was the happiest
I'd ever seen her with you.

You're a good match.

And with Claire?

I don't think that
was an easy thing to find.

To Claire.

Thanks for lettin' me crash,
man.

Yeah.

So, where are you
off to tomorrow?

I'm going to the French alps,
man.

Friend of mine has an
adventure-guide service thing.

Take rich tourists climbing,

<i>camping, make it feel dangerous.</i>

<i>I'm gonna do a few trips
with him,</i>

<i>make some money, and then...</i>

Hey, what are you doing?

You think I can make it?

<i>Not without breaking your neck,</i>

<i>come on.</i>

Hey! Hey!

What?
You don't think I'll do it?

You're being an idiot.

Now, come on
before someone see you.

Dare me.

<i>Dare me.</i>

I dare you.

Jesus.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

<i>My leg.</i>

Is it broken?

Aw, Jesus.

Come on, man.

Come on, let's get you home.

Let's get you home.

Now, come on.
There you go.

I got you.

Shit.

There he is.
How you feeling?

Hey, um...

Sorry about last night.

I was just...
You know, I was just drunk.

No shit.
You all right?

Yeah, I'm just a little,
you know, bruised up,

but I'll be fine.

Okay.

Okay.

So, what's your plan today?

My flight's
not until 4:00.

Oh, um...

You know, actually,

I have a bunch of errands
to run.

I don't think I'll be back
before then.

But, you know,
you can stay as you want.

Just... you can just lock the
door when you leave, you know?

Awesome, man.
Thanks.

<i>- Yeah, no problem.</i>
Yeah.

Hi.

Hello.

Are you busy?

No, not really.

Do you wanna eat?

I kinda owe you.

Come on.

Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry about the mess.

No, i... I like your place.

Really? Do you want
a beer or something?

Sure. Thank you.

So, um...

What do you do, Claire?

Well... I'm currently pursuing
a career in dry cleaning.

Doing what?

I work at a dry cleaners.

Oh.

Did you take these?

Yeah, it's a... it's a hobby
of mine.

Oh.
I really like them.

Where is that?

I... Vancouver.

What do you do?

Graphic design sort of stuff.

Nothing too exciting, but...

Cool.

What is that you got there?

Dinner,
and it should be ready in,

ooh, three and a half minutes.

My god, that's not long.

Claire, that's not food.

Sure, it is.

You've been eating stuff
like that?

Yeah, I mean...
Put that down.

Okay, i... I know
a little thing about food.

Do you wanna come with me?
Can I make you something?

Come here.

End of the line, son.

Can I just stay on for a while?

What, this ain't a shelter,
buddy.

It's for gettin'
where you need to go, huh?

Hey! Hey!

What the fuck?

Oh...

<i>You're home early.</i>

<i>You said you'd be gone all day.</i>

What are you doing?

Oh, man. David.

I'm sorry.

What the fuck is this?

I'm just looking for something.

That's all.
I can't find it.

You weren't supposed
to come home.

I don't understand.

Yeah, Boulder
really wasn't for me.

Kind of ski bum,
beer pong situation.

I didn't make a ton of friends.

Mmm, my god, this is so good.

So, where did you grow up?

Salt lake city.
Pretty happening spot.

Yeah.
Birthplace of jazz.

Hmm?

Nothing.
Never mind.

Your family still there?

Family's not really part
of the picture.

Where are you from?

San Jose, California.

And your parents,
they still live there?

My, uh, my mom does, but my dad,

he actually died
when I was a kid.

Which is a hilarious thing
to talk about.

But long story short, my mom,

after he died, she, uh,

she found, Jesus.

Mmm.

I'm... I'm aware of him.

Yeah, well, apparently,
he was in San Jose,

of all places,
and now, you know,

she... she collects these
little baby figurines.

Yeah, like...

Like, you know, anything baby,

like little baby sculptures.

Anyways, now the house is filled

with millions
of little babies everywhere.

Like, little angel babies.

Yeah, it's, uh, it's a little...

It's a little creepy.

Also the whole place
is kind of, um,

kind of depressing,
not just my...

Not just my house,
but San Jose in general.

I don't...

It's a boring place.
I don't really like it there.

You know, it's, uh...

I go there sometimes, you know.

Not as often as I should.

But, yeah.

I wanted to do that.

That's, uh, that's okay.

Oh, jeez.

I'm still chewing my food.

That's... no, wait,
that's disgusting.

His name is buck Cameron.

So, he's a friend?

A friend of my girlfriend's
from college.

Is your girlfriend here?
Can I speak with her?

No, she's not here.

She, um...

She disappeared
a little over a year ago.

<i>She's missing.</i>

Hey, David.

Hey.
Detective Sloan.

I heard what happened.
You all right?

Oh, yeah.
My head hurts.

Yeah, I bet.

Doc said the cat scan
looks fine,

gave me some medicine
for the pain, so.

Good, look,
the reason why I'm here

is I figured
rather than letting you

get the runaround
from god knows who,

I'd take a look for you.

Your pal buck never
flew out yesterday,

not under that name at least.

What do you mean
under that name?

You said he went
to the university of Colorado

in Boulder, is that right?

Yes,
that's where Claire met him.

There's no record of him there.

That's gotta be a mistake.

I don't think it is, David.

On a hunch, I checked.
Claire didn't go there, either.

Wait, wait.

What do you...
What do you mean?

Listen, David,
you can tell me honestly.

Do you know
what he was looking for?

No.

So, you don't know
if he found it either.

Sloan: <i>Do you know what
he was looking for?</i>

You found me.

Wow, this place is cool.

Yeah.

What's this?

Oh, I made you some lunch.

That's so sweet.

Yeah, there's a little
something inside.

So, what have you been
working on?

Ugh, I've been looking
at it all day.

Well, I haven't.
Let me see.

You can see it when I do
something good, okay?

Fine.

When I'm done.
Okay?

Excuse me.

Hey, sorry, uh, sorry
to bother you, but, um...

Have you seen this girl?

Do you recognize her?
No?

Jesus.
You're not allowed back here.

This is off-limits.

I'm sorry,
I was just looking around.

Get out of here now.

Man:<i> What is going on?</i>
Nothing.

<i>Who is this?</i>

<i>This is no one.
He is confused.</i>

Come on, let's go.
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

Is there something
that we can help you with?

Yeah, have you, um...

Have you seen this girl?

Do you recognize her?

Fisnik, let go of the poor boy.

This girl, how do you know her?

Well, she's my girlfriend.

She<i> was</i> my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

I see.

That is very sad.

Do you...
Do you know her?

No.

Why would I know her?

Look, I-i don't know.
I just..

Why do you come here looking
for this girl, huh?

Uh...

I was just
looking everywhere for her.

But...
But why do you come<i> here?</i>

Uh... hey.

She just spent
a lot of time in this...

In this area,
so I thought maybe...

Ah, ah.
W-w-what is your name?

My name's David.

Now you have a problem, David.

What do you mean?
What's... what's my problem?

I don't believe you.

Hey, wait, I think we just have

a bit of a misunderstan...
Wait a minute.

David, David.
Look at me.

You have to convince me now.

I'm telling you the truth.

Look, maybe...
Let me just go home, okay?

I'll just go home.

What do you do, David?
What... what is your job?

I, uh...
I do graphic design.

I design for websites.

Ah.

I believe that.

Sit down.

All right.

Now... the truth.

I don't...

I don't know what to say.

Don't pay attention to him.
Pay attention to me.

What do you want?

Why did you come here?

I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

I am starting
to lose Patience, David.

I know that you are
looking for this lady.

Why here?

I'm looking everywhere.

<i>Hey, hey, hey...</i>

So?

Uh...

I saw this address
written down. Okay?

It was written on a piece
of paper in her handwriting.

You know, I was just
cleaning out her things and...

You know,
I thought I'd just come here.

I was just...
Just hoping that maybe...

What is her name?

Her name is Claire.

Claire.

Maybe it would be better for you

if you stopped looking for her.

Maybe you don't like
what you find.

David:
<i>Detective Sloan?</i>

Yeah, um...

I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

I was hoping you could check
on a few things for me.

Can I ask you a question?

Sure.

You always change the subject

whenever I ask you about
your family or anything.

That's not a question.

Why can't we talk about it?

Why are you so interested in it?

Well, I don't know, because...

I'm in love with you.

You are?

Yeah.

I mean, should I not be?

Well, it's kind of
out of my control, so...

What is it that you want?

What are you after?

You.

Oh, shit.

Does, uh, does your head hurt?

You want some of these?

<i>It helps.</i>

I want you to answer
a few questions first,

and then I'll give it to you.

<i>Why did you come here?</i>

I'm not gonna talk to you.

Okay.

All right.

You're not gonna use that.

How do you know?

Just a feeling you get.

<i>What feeling?</i>

Fear.

<i>And you're not afraid right now?</i>

No.

<i>What about now?</i>

<i>Do you know how much this hurts?</i>

Yeah, well, I do.

Why did you come here?

For information.

<i>What information?</i>

Anything I could find.

Or get out of you.

I don't know anything.

<i>You'd be surprised
what you know.</i>

Do you know what happened
to Claire?

Huh?

Did you do something to her?

You think I know something?

We're the same, David.

We're both looking
for the same thing.

Yeah? What?

Her.

Hey, David.

Hey.

Can I come in?

Yeah, uh...

Jesus Christ.

Yeah.
Sorry about... the mess.

I did some digging around
like you asked.

Called in some favors.

Why don't you sit down?

She was lying to you.

Okay.

She didn't go to school
in Boulder.

She didn't grow up
in salt lake city, either.

Found no record
of her parents there.

Why would Claire lie about that?

I mean, I'm looking into it,

but listen,
this girl's fucked up.

You know, she was clearly
a part of something

or she just wasn't
who you thought she was.

No, not really.

No, I paid for a lot of things,

but, you know,
she just didn't make that much.

Right.

Look, I think the best thing
for you to do

is to put her out
of your head, move on.

Fuckin' cats.

It's just clumsy.

Hey, you know,
thanks for your help.

Look, if anything else pops up,

I'll let you know.

Hey, hey, hey.

Come on.

All right.

How do you know Claire?

I don't know her.

Why are you looking for her?

Open my shirt.

What?

Open my shirt.

You want to know why,
open my shirt.

Pull it open.

There's two more in my stomach.

She didn't expect me to live.

No.

No, that's not right.

Claire couldn't...

Claire?

Eve is what she call herself.

It was my brother she was after.

He wasn't as lucky I was.

They met in a bar in Chicago.

He pick her up.

The hotel Marlaina.

You know it?

<i>Yeah.
It's nice.</i>

<i>Also a good place to go</i>

<i>if you're looking to pick up
high-end whore.</i>

<i>And he was.</i>

<i>Not my brother's
typical taste, but...</i>

She put a knife in him.

Do you have any brothers?

What would you do
if you found her?

What would you do?

My people are going to come
looking for me soon.

Good.
Then they can cut you loose.

Oh. How much is this?

<i>They're not going to be happy
with what you've done.</i>

Well, maybe you can
put in a good word for me.

All right.
What's your name?

Aleksander.

Aleksander.

I'm David.

Let's hope we never meet again.

One ticket to Vancouver, please.

Here we are.
Lots of light.

Mm.
Just painted.

Yeah, it's...
It's wonderful.

<i>All these houses
were built in the '20s.</i>

<i>This one's 1916.</i>

<i>Bought this place
and the one next door</i>

<i>about ten years ago,
fixed 'em up.</i>

<i>Please, take a look around.</i>

David:
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

Claire:
<i>I like it.</i>

What are you doing?
Here.

I'm just showing you
how to do it right.

I like how I do it.

Yeah, but it's wrong.

It's not gonna look as good.

I know how to paint.

Mmm, I don't know if you do.

Oh?
Gonna be an asshole?

Hey, I'm never an asshole.

Right now you are.

Mmm, not really.

I'm just kinda, you know,
being normal.

Well, agree to disagree,
I guess.

Baby,
we just have so much to do,

and the ceiling
is gonna take forever.

You know what?
I'll do the ceiling.

You just relax.

You're not
going to do the ceiling.

Why not?

Because it's gonna be
all messy and bad.

Like your wall,
which... sucks.

You know what?

I'm gonna do the ceiling
right now,

and it's gonna be incredible.

Okay.
If you say so.

Yeah. Maybe you should go
have a beer.

You're getting very worked up
about the paint job.

Hey.

Word. Great.

I'm all about that.

Yeah, yeah.

<i>David, I'm done.</i>

Wow.

That's, uh, that's beautiful.

You mind?

David: <i>This is gonna
be hell to paint over.</i>

Tomorrow.

Okay.

Gimme your hand.

I don't get it.

"Sarah?"

It's a joke.

Isn't Sarah the name
of the waitress

that you like
at what's-it-called?

What? Sophie's?

Is her name Sarah?

Yeah, right?

It's a joke.

Ah, it's incredibly hilarious.

Much better.

Yeah.

David: <i>So I got
sort of a strange question.</i>

Do you, uh...

Recognize this guy?

You know who he is?

What's this about?

Well, I, um, I got these photos

off an old camera that I bought,

and I thought maybe

I could get them back
to their rightful owner.

Any ideas?

That's Mr. Garan.

Mr. Garan.
Does he work here?

<i>He used to.</i>

<i>Mr. Garan passed
five years ago.</i>

<i>He was a good man.</i>

All right.

Well, I'm sorry to...
Sorry to hear that.

Thank you.

Do you know, was he married?

David: <i>Hello.
My name is David.</i>

Are you a reporter?

No, no, absolutely not.

Look, this is a little
hard to explain, but, um...

My... my girlfriend,
she disappeared

a little over a year ago,
and ever since then,

I, um...
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

I just know that she spent a lot

of time here in Vancouver

before I knew her,
and I know that she

was really interested
in your... in your husband.

Look, I'm just grasping
at straws here,

and I just...

Do you...
Do you recognize her?

I met a lot of people
with Richard.

I'm sorry.
Well, her name was...

I don't know her.

I'm very sorry.
Good luck.

Agh! Aah!

Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

No, stop! Stop!
Please!

Oh...

Stop!

No, please! Help me!

Help me!
No, no, no! Please!

Don't move!
Get down on your knees!

Down on your knees!

Where are we going?

<i>Get out.</i>

David, how do you do?
John hall.

Thanks, guys.

I apologize,
we must have frightened you.

What do you want?

I wanna talk to you.

And who the fuck are you?

I work for the government.
Defense.

I tell ya...

I don't usually go in for this
nature shit, but god damn.

This is something, huh?

Take a look at that.

Makes your heart go.

Yeah, you're looking
for your ex-girlfriend.

You knew her, I guess?

Yes.

I'm here to answer
a few of your questions.

The ones I can, at least.
Give you some closure.

But none of this
is gonna be easy, David.

Okay?

Claire worked for us
in a variety of capacities.

Like what?

Mmm, it was required that she
establish a cover, a life,

one that would allow
for a great deal of travel,

one that wouldn't draw
a lot of attention.

So, where is she?

July of last year, she was
called in for an assignment.

She was killed in action
36 hours later.

I'm sorry, David.

No.

See, you're lying.
That doesn't make sense.

I really am sorry to tell you.

Okay.

Okay, well, do you have any...

Any proof, huh?

Of any of this?

I mean, you're so interested
in giving me closure.

Open this if you have to,
but I've seen what's inside,

and I wouldn't, if I were you.

I mean it.

We need you to stop digging
around her past, David.

She handled sensitive material.

Sensitive situations
that don't need stirring

by your inexpert hands.

It's dangerous.
For you, for all of us.

Just let it go, okay?

You're still on the outside.
Stay there.

<i>I can't guarantee
your safety otherwise.</i>

<i>Take your time.</i>

Hey!

Babe!

Hey.

Hey, Claire.

Babe.

Babe. Let me in.

What's wrong?

Claire.

Answer me.

Claire, open the door.

- Claire,
open the door, please?

Cl... Claire!

Claire!

Hey. Hey, hey.

Oh... ah, Jesus Christ.
Oh, my god, what happened?

I got mugged.

I was stupid,
I... I tried to fight back.

No, no, no, no.

Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

Come here.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

David:
<i>So, what was her name?</i>

Was it Claire?

Can I ask you a question?

What brought you
to Garan's house?

Just photos.

Old photos she had
before I knew her.

Regular Philip Marlowe,
am I right?

So, who was he?

<i>You tell me.</i>

Some rich venture capitalist?

That's right.

Weekends, he liked to put
on a red hood,

convince discontented teens
to join the cause

of white supremacy.

<i>He put enough cash
in the right pockets</i>

<i>to keep that fact secret.</i>

So what, you just...
Had him killed?

Richard Garan
died of a heart attack.

Oh, yeah.

I had a run in with
some Columbian mercenaries

a couple years back.

More metal than man
at this point.

That must've been
a long recovery.

Oof. Two years
physical therapy

before I stopped

walking like a zombie
from those bad movies.

<i>What, were you, like,
on crutches</i>

<i>for a while or something?</i>

A cane.

You said you have those photos
on your computer?

<i>You mind if I take a look?</i>

Did I say that?

Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?

No, um...

Thanks.

Hmm.

<i>I'm asking myself, "why is he
so interested in my rehab?"</i>

But I realized,

you haven't been completely
honest with me, have you?

<i>David...</i>

Where are the negatives?

No. Really?

Son of a bitch.

It's amazing how things
change so quick.

What was it,
a minute ago, 80 seconds tops,

you made that comment about
my leg and tipped your hand.

<i>You were gonna go home,
live a life,</i>

<i>meet a girl probably,
have a couple kids.</i>

She's still alive.

Hmm?

She's alive.
Isn't she?

She's dead.

Take this left.

Where'd you get that?

Let me out.

Here.
Pull over!

No, don't...
Don't pull over, Michael.

What a mess.

<i>Nothing's gone as I intended,
not one thing.</i>

Hey.

Hey.

I tried you
at the... the darkroom.

I had my headphones on.

<i>Mmm. How was it?</i>

It was fine.

Did you bring anything back?

<i>No.</i>

There wasn't anything
good enough to save.

Is something wrong?

I'm just tired.

And that's the end of it.

Just tired, David.

What, you wanna have a whole
conversation about that?

I just haven't seen you all day.

<i>I was working.</i>

No, I, uh, I know.

You've been working every night

for the past three weeks.

<i>I haven't seen you.</i>

<i>I'm sorry that I wanna have
a conversation with you</i>

<i>when I do.</i>
Yeah, well, I'm sorry that I wanna sleep when I'm tired.

Wow, you're... you're being
such a bitch right now.

What?

Fuck you.

<i>Hey.</i>

Hey, does this have to do
with what... happened?

What are you talking about?
Does what have to do with it?

The fact
that you won't speak to me,

that you're a million miles away

and I can't bring you back.

Don't be such a drama queen.

I'm right<i> here.</i>

Then why does it feel like
as close as I get to you,

I'm not even...
<i>I don't know, David.</i>

Maybe I'm broken that way.
Maybe it's impossible.

It sure fucking seems like it,
Claire.

<i>Yeah, well...</i>

I'm glad
that we figured that out.

I'm gonna go to sleep.

All right.

Good night.

Can I help you?

Hi, um...

I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute.

Okay.

It's about Dana.

Have a... have a seat.

Thanks.

Oh, did you get married?

Yeah. Elise.

Year ago next week.

So...

So... you and Dana.

She went missing five years ago?

Yeah.

Vanished.

You two were happy?

I don't know.

I thought we were.

What are you getting at?

I'm sorry.

I met her...

About four years ago.

Where?

Los Angeles.

Is she, uh...

She's gone.

It was a bad car accident.

It was about a year ago.

And ever since then, I...

Started looking into her past,
which led me to you.

And I just thought
that you'd want to know,

just so you could stop
looking...

In case you were.

Yeah.

Fuck, I'm...

Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

I didn't expect to be
thinking about this today.

She talk about me?

She didn't tell me much
about her past.

Sounds like her.

I did look for her for a while,

but who walks out like that?

May... maybe I was an asshole?
I think about it.

I think maybe i... maybe I was
a little too hard on her.

She just... you know,
we just weren't a good match.

Doesn't mean you walk out,
though.

You don't let a person wonder,

even if she hated me.

She didn't.

I'm certain she loved you.

You can't fake that.

Well, this is all I have.

Dana took those.

Well, listen,
I appreciate you coming,

but I should get to work.

Of course, yeah.

Hey, Charlie.

This guy here.

That's Kyle.

<i>That's Dana's friend
from... from home.</i>

<i>That's Kyle.</i>

You two stay in touch?

<i>I mean,
not really since she left.</i>

<i>We talked a few times,
but you know.</i>

You got a number for him?
I'd like to reach out.

David: <i>Hey, Kyle. Or buck.</i>

Or whatever
the fuck your name is.

This is David Larraine.

Yeah, I got your number,
fuckshit, and, hey, listen,

you know that thing you were
looking for at my place?

<i>Well, guess what?
I have it.</i>

<i>If you want it,
you're gonna meet me</i>

<i>on the southwest corner
of Blake and Van nuys</i>

<i>the morning of the sixth,
3:00 A.M.</i>

<i>Come alone, and, I don't know,</i>

<i>bring a million dollars
with you.</i>

<i>If not, these pictures
are going everywhere,</i>

<i>and I have a feeling
if that happens,</i>

<i>you're gonna wind up
in a ditch someplace.</i>

<i>Am I right?</i>

<i>See you Friday.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Hey, Aleksander.
This is David Larraine.

If you wanna know where Eve is,

I'm meeting her
at 3:00 A.M.

She'll be in a black SUV
parked in a lot

on the south side of Van nuys
just east of Blake.

She's all yours.

What the fuck is this?

Shit.

Man:
<i>Where is she?</i>

Buck:<i> David?</i>
Throw your phone in the gutter

and head up Van nuys,
enter the parking structure.

<i>On the left,
there'll be a car parked</i>

<i>with its door open.</i>

Get in.

I want to be left alone.
Okay?

I will go away,

and you will never hear
from me again.

I have what you're looking for,

but you're never gonna find it.

If I die, everybody finds it.

That's not how this works.

How does it work?

You are just a scared guy

who threw me in the back
of a blacked-out beemer.

We're something else.

We're a different category
of person.

You wanna keep those pictures
as an insurance policy?

People like I work for can't
live with that in this world.

If I die, they get out.

To who, David?
Hmm?

You haven't thought
this through.

<i>The New York times?</i>

They won't know
what the fuck they are.

I'm sorry, David.

Sarah was a threat.
You are just a loose end.

And there is a bullet
coming your way right now.

It is cutting
through this world,

and it can only end up
in one place.

No.

I'll find a way.

You underestimate me, buck.

You have every step of the way.

Mm, no, not this time.

Smart, blacking out the windows,

no one can see in.

Trouble is,
you can't see out, either.

You have no idea what's coming.

Out of the car! Get out of the car!
Hand in the air!

One the ground!
Don't move! Don't fucking...

Are you mad?

Come here.

Have I really been
a million miles away?

Mm-hmm.

I got lost.

It happens now and then.

Okay.

But you can't leave me
out there, though.

You gotta bring me back.

I always will.

Promise?

No matter what.

David.
We meet again.

Where's the film?

I'm not going to tell you.

Okay. That's what
I thought you'd say.

I'm gonna send a man in here.

It's his job to get information

from reluctant sources.

Usually he's working
with trained operatives

who've been prepared
for such treatment

and who believe if they
give up the information,

it will cost many of their
countrymen their lives,

not to mention compromise their
own place in the afterlife.

You, on the other hand,

are protecting the whereabouts

of a roll of film,

the significance of which
you don't understand,

for a dead girl who lied to you,

<i>used you,
and made a fool of you.</i>

Anyway, I'm gonna walk out.

He's gonna come in,
and in a few minutes,

he's gonna leave
with what he came for.

<i>Or</i> you could tell me now,
spare yourself the discomfort.

All right.

You're very brave, David.

I admire that.
Truly.

Thanks for coming.

David?

My name's David.

Where's the film?

I don't... I don't have it.

Where's the film?

I don't have it.
I don't have it. I don't...

Please, please, stop!

Stop! Stop!

Where's the film?

Stop! St...

What's going on?

Do not move!

David.

What did he do to you?

Where have you been?

Why did they do this?

I came looking for you.

I just got so close.

How?

The film in the garden.

Your film.

Where is it?

Home.

It's at our home.

We have to...
Have to get out of here.

Wait, wait.

David, there's no time for that.

We gotta go.

You can use one of these?
Come on.

Are you all right?
Yeah.

Come on.

David:
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

Damn it. Shit.

We gotta get out of here.
Get out!

Shit.

Stay here.

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

Get off the bike!
Off the bike!

Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go!

Claire: <i>Where is it, David?
The film?</i>

In the mail.

Well, that's not good.

What is it?

It's proof
that hall had been turned.

It was...

This was my only protection.

Claire...
We have to get out of here.

Claire. Wait. Stop.

They'll be looking for us...
Stop.

I haven't seen you.

Are you hurt?

Where? David?

David. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

Who are you?

I'm a lot of different people.

I looked for you.

I know.

I didn't think you'd understand.

I was wrong.
I'm sorry.

If you come with me...

We can never, ever come back.

Stay here.

Claire:
<i>Shit.</i>

What?
<i>We're surrounded.</i>

So, what do we do now?

We fight.

<i>Hey. Look at that.</i>

I didn't know
you could still see it.

<i>Me neither.</i>

Hey.
Where we gonna go?

Anywhere you want.

Well, I wanna go someplace warm,

somewhere I've never been.

Far away?

Yeah.

When?

Let's go right now.

Hall's men are out back.
Aleksander's are out front.

<i>What do you think
our best chances are?</i>

Not good either way.

All right.

You choose.

<i>No, you.</i>

Okay, fine.

South America?

Are we really gonna do this?

Yes.

We have to.

Okay.

Ready?

On three.

Hey, babe?

I love you.

Hey.

Let's live.

Yeah.

Okay.
Ready?

Both:
One, two, three.
