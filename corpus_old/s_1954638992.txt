         News reporter:
    <i> In the summer of 2013,</i>

   <i> a deadly virus had been</i>
     <i> accidently released</i>

      <i> from a scientific</i>
       <i> research center</i>

          <i> and killed</i>
     <i> thousands of people.</i>

    <i> The authorities denied</i>
<i> the existence of such virus,</i>

      <i> in order to avoid</i>
  <i> a massive panic situation.</i>

    <i> But a few days later,</i>
      <i> the virus mutated</i>

  <i> and the corpses started to</i>
           <i> rise up.</i>

  <i> A single physical contact</i>
       <i> from an infected</i>

      <i> will turn you into</i>
         <i> one of them.</i>

     <i> The virus took over</i>
      <i> in the West Coast</i>

 <i> and spread towards the east</i>
<i> and nothing seems to stop it.</i>

     Ladies and gentlemen,

 to bring you a special report.

             I am--

 Oh, sweet mother, have mercy.

      -I've been bit, Bob.
          -Bob:<i> Shit.</i>

      Bob, I've been bit.

-Keep the camera rolling, Bob.

        Keep it rolling.

      I've been reporting
        the nightly news

     for the last 20 years.

      And I'm not about to
           let these

     zombie sons of bitches

     Ladies and gentlemen,

           (growling)

         I said, stay--

          (TV static)

      It was sadness that
    I report to you tonight

   that this zombie epidemic
    has not been contained.

     Ladies and gentlemen,

         the human race
        has had its day.

       Now, we are living
        in Zombieworld.

   As researchers desperately
  scour their expansive heads

   trying to find clues as to
      what may have caused

    the zombie apocalypse...

...some are turning to the past.

 We take you now, to the place
     where the first clash

     between the living and
       the dead occurred,

   more than 2000 years ago.

      Zombies didn't stand
     a chance against him.

     May he be with us now
      in our darkest hour.

          -Right, Bob?
  -Bob:<i> Amen to that, brother.</i>

   Yes, Bob. Are you afraid?

  <i> Fucking freaking out man!</i>

        Good Bob, good.

       Keep rolling, Bob.
   At all cost, keep rolling.

    Mother fucking zombies.

     Ladies and gentlemen,
       stay tuned to KPRS

  for minute by minute reports
          and updates

       on how to survive
        in Zombieworld.

    And now, a public safety
         announcement.

     Announcer:<i> Have people</i>
 <i> around you began to change?</i>

    <i> Do they seem strange?</i>
   <i> Produce strange sounds?</i>

       <i> Oh, and want to</i>
       <i> eat your brain?</i>

   <i> Welcome to Zombieworld.</i>

        <i> How to survive</i>
     <i> a zombie apocalypse.</i>

           (whispers)
   <i> This can save your life.</i>

        (brakes screech)

   <i> The most important thing</i>
       <i> is not to panic.</i>

  <i> You are gonna have to kill</i>
        <i> some zombies.</i>

     <i> So, let's get to it.</i>

          <i> Thoroughly</i>
     <i> study the situation.</i>

    <i> Then, arm yourself.</i>

 <i> The zombies are pretty slow</i>
  <i> and unintelligent beings.</i>

 <i> But for some strange reason,</i>
        <i> in many cases,</i>

  <i> they catch their victims.</i>

<i> So be extremely careful.</i>

   <i> How to identify zombies,</i>
           <i> you ask?</i>

           <i> Usually,</i>
  <i> they are stumbling around</i>

   <i> holding a piece of limb.</i>

    <i> They are missing parts</i>
        <i> of their head,</i>

    <i> have sunken eyes, and</i>
 <i> produce a sound like this...</i>

        (groaning sound)

      <i> You can kill them</i>
  <i> by destroying their brain</i>

      <i> or blowing a hole</i>
         in their head.

      <i> If you use a gun,</i>
    <i> it is better to wait</i>

<i>until they get a little closer,</i>
      <i> to make sure that</i>

   <i> you will hit the target.</i>

   <i> But don't get too close.</i>

   <i> Shoot them in the head!</i>

       <i> And, as always,</i>
   <i> watch your surroundings,</i>

    <i> because zombies travel</i>
          <i> in packs.</i>

           (gunfire)

      <i> If you notice that</i>
        <i> zombies emerge</i>

   <i> from several directions</i>

    <i> the safest thing to do</i>
   <i> is to find a safe place</i>

    to assess the situation.

       <i> After assessing</i>
        <i> their number,</i>

    <i> quickly and thoroughly</i>
    <i> eliminate the threat.</i>

           (gunshot)

     <i> And one more thing:</i>

        <i> this requires</i>
        <i> serious music.</i>

 <i> If the city is overrun with</i>
           <i> zombies,</i>

    <i> there's a good chance</i>
     <i> that the government</i>

 <i> will order the sterilization</i>
        <i> of that city.</i>

       <i> See what I mean?</i>

<i>Good evening, I'm Marvin Gloatt</i>
      <i> and this is KPRS.</i>

       <i> The only station</i>
     <i> you will ever need.</i>

 <i> The only station you've got.</i>

  We are reporting on day nine
   of the zombie apocalypse.

       And we won't stop.

    Ladies and gentlemen,
    we are receiving reports

  that the freeways are jammed

     with people trying to
          leave town.

         This is a bad,
     I repeat, a bad idea.

        As I've already
      exclusively reported

    in my exclusive reports,
      this appears to be a

        global epidemic,
       and not contained

  only to a few cities in the
   United States of America.

  Please, remain indoors until
  the situation is contained.

     Please keep doors and
        windows bolted

  until instructed otherwise.

     -KPRS will continue--
    <i> -</i> Bob:<i> Oh, my God, no!</i>

 <i> -Marvin, he got in. Marvin!</i>
           -Damn it!

  <i> I want to stay here. He is</i>
   <i> here, I got him. No, no!</i>

        <i> No, oh again!</i>
        <i> Oh no, Marvin!</i>

        (stabing sounds)

      <i> Marvin, I got him!</i>
      <i> I'm done with him!</i>

   <i> I'm done with him! See!</i>
             <i> See!</i>

            -(gasps)
           -(groans)

          <i> Marvin...</i>
    <i> Marvin, are you okay?</i>

           I got it.

  <i> Marvin! Oh my God, Marvin!</i>

       Keep rolling, Bob!

          <i> -Rolling.</i>
     -Don't leave me, Bob.

 <i> I'm with you until the end,</i>
           <i> brother.</i>

     I've got an axe, Bob.

    I've got a very big axe!

    <i> You got them, Marvin!</i>

  We take you now to Ireland,

      where zombie attacks
       are being reported

     on that Emerald Isle.

           (growling)

            (pants)

             Steve?

    I'm back from shopping.

 You won't believe the trouble.

              Oh.

  Craig from down the road...
           he's dead.

     So, I guess that's it.
We're the last two alive.

    They left the door open.

  Jesus, Steve, what happened?

       Well, obviously...

     Oh Christ, believe me,
   I don't want to be alone.

      I'm alone aren't I?

      There are no zombies
          in the flat.

        -(Steve murmurs)
           -Oh great!

         I'm all alone.

         I'm all alone.

     It's like last summer
 when you all went to Majorca,

    and I couldn't afford to
     so I had to stay home.

     I had all these things
            planned.

  Things I wanted to tell you.

      I was going to start
         with all the--

       all the bad stuff,
  just get it out of the way,

      get it off my chest.

      There was a time...

        ...atUniversity,
     just before we met...

  Do you remember when we met?

            Standing
      in the dinner queue,

        we were the only
   two English people there.

      And then we ended up
 going to that meet and greet,

 only to find it was a bunch of
       God squaders. Huh!

     Me, you and a bunch of
          Christians.

 Hey, I'd love to see the look
    on their faces now, eh,

   what with all the zombies.

             I know
    they are always going on

     about the apocalypse,

but that's when God let all the
   good ones into the heaven

     and sent the bad ones
         down to hell.

 Maybe the whole world is bad.

          If you take
    the Ten Commandments

    as like the literal Word
      of God then, yeah...

   ...the whole world is bad.

    Maybe the bible bashers
      were right, I mean,

     you have broken a few.

           So have I.

        (exhales)

      It was on a Sunday,
      so that's one down.

I probably said, "Jesus Christ",
     while I was doing it.

  I don't remember worshipping
          a false god,

        but I can't say
      I definitely didn't.

  What classes as a false god
      these days, anyway?

 I mean I worship "the pussy".

  You know what I mean, but...

Oh, yes. Yes, "the pussy".

 But yes, it is not like it is
    a false god or anything,

       it is just like...
       well, "the pussy".

    So, its not a false god,

        it is just like
      an alternative one.

        (creaking)

 That will be the undead again.

    Hey, they'll not get in,
        don't you worry.

            (laughs)

          (door opens)

      Oh shit, I have left
    the door open. One sec.

             Idiot!

      Hey, this reminds me
         of that time,

      remember that party,

      when I put dog shit
      on the door handle?

      Ooh, that was funny.

       Not for the people
       with shitty hands.

         Or dysentery.

      But man, I laughed.

 I remember, everyone thinking
    I was really rude,

  for not shaking their hands,
        but I knew best.

    Ho ho, man, did I know.

   Anyway, that's when I told
       Dave about your...

  ...your thing. what was it?
          That secret?

      I remember it being
    really important to you,

     but I don't know why.

  Maybe that's why I told him.

i know you never liked Dave.

         -(spluttering)
       -But I was wasted,

      and I was on a high
  from the dog shit gag, so...

           (coughing)

         (spluttering)

           I guess...

  ...the band is not going to
         take off now.

  As soon as the zombies came,

           I knew...
     I knew it wouldn't...

        Well, as long as
  you were there, I thought...

 I thought I'd have an audience
           at least.

       I know you thought
 I was talentless, little kid,

       but you listened.

      You even didn't mind
         when I played

 on your first date with Katie.
          She is dead.

      I used to fancy her.

       I spied on you two
        having sex once.

  Oh... she had awesome tits.

        (sighs) I wish,
     I had filmed that now.

     It would have given me
       something to watch

     during the apocalypse.

      I never had anyone.

     Tried to find a girl,
  but I always scared them off

    because I was too keen.

      All I wanted was...
    was someone to like me,

         to notice me.

      Who will laugh at my
       stupid jokes now?

       I guess I've been
    a bit of a shit friend.

       Maybe I should've
        apologized early

   when you could understand.

   Where is my rounder's bat?

   It better not be your room
         again, you...

        Oh, it's there.

     I can't do this alone.
     I want my friend back.

   I need someone to tell me
           to grow up

     and stop being a dick.

       Someone to show me
      how all this works.

            Yeah...

      I know I annoyed you
        sometimes, mate

         and sometimes
        you annoyed me.

    You were always going on
   about how good your job is

  and how much better in life
     you do than me, but...

      ...I didn't mind...
 I didn't mind, mate because...

          What's this?

      What's this? A note?

       "Chris"... For me?

          "Dear Chris,
    this is my suicide note.

       I'd rather become
       one of the undead

      than spend the rest
      of my life with you

    and your stupid guitar.
          I hate you.

     And hope the zombie me
           eats you.

            Steve."

          (screaming)

         It looks like
    you're not only the one

     who does best in life
      after all, you dick!

             (thud)

 -They just started biting him.

 Reporting to you on day seven
   of the zombie apocalypse.

     Ladies and gentlemen,
 we continue to receive reports

     from around the globe
 of the undead indiscriminately

    attacking and devouring
          the living.

 Mothers eating their children.

        Husbands gorging
        on their wives.

   Even domesticated animals
have gotten in on the act.

  We are receiving reports of
          undead cows

  going on rampages attacking
   and devouring the living.

         Oh, the irony!

   Scientists report finding
     cow patties containing

   undigested human remains.

        Teeth, digits...
      even wedding bands.

      The world has indeed
       gone topsy-turvy.

We take you now to Australia...

    ...where that continent
      has been overrun...

    ...by flesh eating scum.

     Ladies and gentlemen,
       before we go on...

...may I take a moment to honor
 the brave KPRS men and women,

   who have given their lives
  in the service of reporting

   this great global tragedy.

     Steve, the weatherman.

   How is it looking, Steve?

     Cindy, the sports gal.

         Just ask Cindy
       what the score is.

      Riva, the mail lady.

     She always delivered.

     Foreign correspondent,
    Ramudajab Punjawalesifu.

        And the intern.

      You know, that guy.

    And now, a public safety
     announcement from our

       KPRS affiliate in
         Washington DC.

 Announcer:<i> So, you have killed</i>
        <i> a few zombies.</i>

   <i> But you ran out of Ammo.</i>

      <i> And now there is a</i>
     new breed of zombies.

 <i> And they are so</i> (beep)<i> fast.</i>
         <i> Don't panic.</i>

    <i> Here we have some guy</i>
     <i> who is not a zombie.</i>

       <i> And that guy...</i>
  (whispers)<i> that's a zombie.</i>

       (heavy breathing)

           <i> You see,</i>
    <i> zombies are like cars.</i>

    <i> The more they fill up,</i>
      <i> the more they go.</i>

     <i> Take this beady-eyed</i>
        <i> little creep.</i>

       <i> Look at him go.</i>

 <i> But like many speeding cars,</i>
   <i> this can also end up...</i>

             (thud)

       <i> ...with a crash.</i>

           (growling)

       <i> Have to survive</i>
  <i> at the zombie apocalypse.</i>

           <i> Sequel.</i>

    <i> A new breed of zombies</i>
           <i> is born.</i>

<i> Faster, stronger, and smarter.</i>

   <i> For their kind, anyway.</i>

    <i> From where you stand,</i>
     <i> they just look like</i>

     <i> your average drunken</i>
      <i> beady-eyed bugger.</i>

          (screaming)

       <i> You better watch</i>
          <i> your back.</i>

       <i> See what I mean?</i>

  <i> Take advantage of zombie's</i>
    <i> animal like instincts</i>

      <i> to surprise them.</i>

   <i> Stab them in their head</i>
   <i> with a... bicycle seat?</i>

             <i> Hm,</i>
 <i> didn't see that one coming.</i>

       <i> Oh, there it is,</i>
      <i> our super zombie.</i>

  <i> Yeah, still looks a little</i>
     <i> wobbly on his feet.</i>

        <i> But trust me,</i>
       <i> he is bad news.</i>

   <i> Who would've thought of</i>
       <i> a bicycle seat?</i>

       -(heavy breathing)
<i> -Oh, and if someone is bitten,</i>

          <i> kill him!</i>

   <i> You don't want one more</i>
  <i> zombie chasing you later.</i>

            (grunts)

       <i> In Zombieworld,</i>

   <i> you don't have much time</i>
       <i> to take a break.</i>

  <i> But when you do, remember</i>
 <i> to enjoy the little things.</i>

   <i> And when you got to go,</i>
        <i> you got to go.</i>

          (trickling)

            (farts)

<i> But back to our super zombie.</i>

     <i> Now he is after you.</i>

   <i> Put your thing away man.</i>
         <i> Put it away.</i>

  <i> Too late. He is too fast.</i>
         <i> Too hungry.</i>

          <i> Too super.</i>

<i> Thank God, you have a partner</i>
    <i> who has got your back.</i>

  <i> Who... forgot his weapons.</i>

    <i> Oh, he came back.</i>

 <i> He throws away his cigarette</i>
 <i> and smacks the super zombie.</i>

            (thuds)

          <i> Bat. Kick!</i>

          <i> Bike seat!</i>

         -(squelching)
    -Whack. Good one. Spear.

    <i> Bike seat throw. Kick!</i>

            <i> Nice.</i>

      <i> Before you leave,</i>
    <i> make sure he is dead.</i>

      (zombie spluttering)

             (thud)

   <i> Fun is a rare commodity</i>
       <i> in Zombieworld.</i>

    <i> But feel free to have</i>
       <i> a victory dance</i>

<i> after killing so many zombies,</i>
         <i> and-- What?</i>

       <i> Our heroes spot</i>
          <i> something.</i>

        <i> It is a hand.</i>

     <i> Is it a zombie hand?</i>

         <i> No, indeed.</i>
     <i> We know those legs.</i>

     <i> That's not a zombie.</i>
  <i> It is our sexy chick from</i>

           <i> Homerun!</i>

 <i> If your friend is bitten...</i>

  <i> ...he will try to hide it</i>

  <i> But it's kind of obvious.</i>

   <i> Even he knows, you know.</i>

        <i> But he is your</i>

      DARK CRYPT OF HORROR

 ASHLEY SAPPLETON, CHAPMANVILLE
        WEST VIRGINIA 29

        (birds chirping)

      (ringing door bell)
       (knocking on door)

            -Hello?
      -Oh, good day miss.

 I have a certified letter for
        Mrs. Sappleton.

    Postman is here for you,
             aunty!

   <i> Where are your manners,</i>
         <i> young lady?</i>

    <i> Get the man something</i>
           <i> to drink</i>

   <i> and I'll be right there.</i>

      Please, do come in.

       Perhaps it's best
    if I just stay out here.

        Don't be silly.

    Our old postman used to
   always come in for a soda.

      Aren't you thirsty?

Well, it sure is awful hot out.

     I'm not that thirsty.

       Expecting guests?

            Guests?

   That would be a blessing.

  Every day for the last year,

    she's been making me set
           these out.

   She just can't accept that
         they are gone.

          So, you are
     not expecting guests?

           A year ago

          on a day...
     just like this one...

        Her husband and
  his younger brother were...

      working at the mine.

 Just like they did every day.

  They were deep underground,

        working the lead
       on a new tunnel...

   when something went wrong.

        One of the men,
    his hands wet with sweat

     dropped his pick axe.

        When it landed,
    the steel from the blade

hit the tiniest piece of flint,

      hidden under a rock.

    The spark from the flint
      hit a bit of hay...

   thrown down to absorb oil
     from a broken lantern.

    It quickly caught ablaze
         and burned...

   in a straight line towards
   a nearby box of dynamite.

         It took weeks
        to dig them out.

     And when their twisted

      and lifeless bodies
      were finally found,

   they were so badly mangled

      that my uncle could
       only be recognized

      by his wedding ring.

           Sometimes,
     when I see the drinks

   sitting there, I forget...

      I expect to see them
          walking up,

        hear them laugh,

    have them tease me about
         my duck feet.

        Oh, I'm so sorry
   to have kept you waiting.

  I needed to freshen up a bit

       before my husband
          comes home.

    He and his brother work
  the early shift at the mine.

       Are you to be our
    new postman, Mister...?

            Nuddle.
    Frank Nuddle, yes ma'am.

    If I could just get your
     signature right here.

          Oh I see...

       this is addressed
         to my husband.

      His name is Ashley.
    Often causes confusion.

 If you could just wait a bit,
    he will be home shortly.

             Yes...

          yes, indeed.

           You know,
    I think it would be okay

      if you sign for him
being as you're married and all.

 If I could get your signature
          right here,

      I will be on my way.

 I still have a few more houses
           to visit.

          -(laughing)
     -(dog barking outside)

      Oh, here he is now.

          (screaming)

         Hi sweetheart.

    Who was that odd fellow?

   That was our new postman.

          I don't know
       what got into him.

          One minute,
he was asking me for a signature

      and the next he ran
   screaming from the house.

              Hmm.

     (dog barking outside)

 I... I suppose it was the dog.

      He said he has had a
      horror of them ever

 since the Battle of the Bulge

     trapped in the middle
          of the night

        in the Ardennes,
      10 feet up the tree.

   Surrounded by the pack of
       vicious beasts...

     sure that any moment,
      their barking would

      bring the Nazis and
 that moment would be his last.

     Enough to make anyone
       lose their nerve.

      <i> A zombie pandemic</i>

      <i> To save yourself,</i>
        <i> we suggest you</i>

       <i> Let's go back to</i>
     <i> the very beginning.</i>

     <i> Whoa! Not that far!</i>

      <i> So, yes, watch our</i>
       <i> special reports.</i>

  <i> We interrupt this program</i>
    <i> to give you a report.</i>

    <i> Listen to your radio.</i>

  <i> ...reports of mass-murder</i>
   <i> from all over the state.</i>

      <i> Check the internet</i>
          <i> or simply</i>

    <i> look out your window.</i>

  <i> Run as fast as you can to</i>
  <i> some less populated area.</i>

       <i> But keep in mind</i>
    <i> that while the zombies</i>

<i> are trying to take your life,</i>

     <i> the living will take</i>
       <i> everything else.</i>

     <i> That car was stolen</i>
        <i> by this girl.</i>

    <i> Who became this zombie</i>

 <i> who was killed by that guy,</i>
      <i> who actually is...</i>

         <i> ...this guy!</i>
    <i> That's Karma for you.</i>

      <i> Yep, still exists</i>
  <i> in the zombie apocalypse.</i>

 <i> When you are left all alone,</i>
      <i> paranoia kicks in.</i>

       <i> Questions like:</i>
   <i> Who started all of this?</i>

    <i> Was it the government,</i>
          <i> aliens...</i>

    <i> We like to believe in</i>
       <i> that old saying.</i>

  <i> When there's no more room</i>
          <i> in hell...</i>

         <i> -The dead...</i>
     -<i> Will walk the Earth.</i>

<i> After killing a lot of zombies</i>

   <i> and losing some friends</i>
        <i> along the way</i>

     <i> you might feel down,</i>
       <i> a bit lonely...</i>

      <i> But don't give up.</i>

 <i> -Happiness might be just...</i>
