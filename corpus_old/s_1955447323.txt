Bloodsport!

Bloodsport!

Bloodsport!

Woman: come on, keller, get up!

[Crowd chanting "kill"]

[chanting dies down]

woman: rip his head off!

Man: take him out!

No.

I will not kill.

This man fought with
skill and dignity,

and you would have
me destroy that integrity.

And why?

To satisfy your lust for death.

There was a time when
kumite meant honor.

But i see now that
kumite here is dead.

It has become nothing
more than a blood sport.

I want him.

But he won't kill,

so what good is he to you?

When he is mine...

i'll make him kill.

You know, i don't get you, keller.

You compete in these
underground cockfights,

and then you're surprised
when things turn ugly.

Hey, i compete to stay sharp.

Fine, i can respect that.

Just don't expect the
paying audience

to share your high ideals
on skill and courage.

You know, blaire, you're the
best partner i ever had.

But you're a pain in the ass.

Same to you, tough guy.

Jesus!

These fights get me all tense.

Hey, don't people say
excuse me anymore?

Why don't you just break down
and get a new pen, rita?

Oh, no way. This is my lucky pen.

It was a christmas
present from my kids.

Let's go for a drink.

Ok, i'll buy for you.

No, i'll buy.

No, i'll buy you a drink.
I'll buy you.

[Dance music playing]

where's the fucking money?

[Woman screams]

no!

Man: what the hell are you doing?

Everybody down!

I'll blow your fucking brains out!

Why are all policewomen so obstinate?

Because we can be.

I'm a police officer.
Release the girl!

Ow!

Aah! Aah!

Oh, my god.

Drop the gun! Release the girl!

Woman on police radio: all
units, a 2-11 in progress

be advised, shots fired at
1100 south robertson.

Suspect is a white male...

let's go, blaire.

[Siren blares]

get back, blaire.

Watch your ass, keller.

What's up, asshole?

I thought you were dead, asshole.

You thought wrong.

You were on death row.

You were supposed to
have been executed.

Jesus christ, keller,

take the shot. You've got him.

Go ahead, take the fucking shot.

Ok, schrek, this can be win-win.

Lower your gun,

and we all walkout of here alive.


ahhh!

Blaire!

I'm unarmed, officer.

Backup's outside. It's over.

Assume the position, asshole.

Whatever you say... babe.

Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-should've
taken the shot.

Blaire: schrek's en route.

Commander anderson also called.

He's stopping by, wants
to be in on this one.

I put schrek's ass away6
years ago for murder.

He was supposed to be executed.

I read the file.

Look... in retrospect,

it wouldn't have mattered

if you'd taken the shot.

He'd have killed the girl anyway.

Bullshit.

I let that girl die.

I need 5 minutes.

Alone.

Keller...

commander anderson wants a 2-man
guard on him until he arrives.

Gentlemen, why don't
you go take a piss

and give us some breathing
room here?

You, too.

Ah, come on, keller.

Your record is clean.

I want to keep it that way.

Out.

Out!

I sure hope you know
what you're doing.

Should've taken the shot, man.

Foreplay.

I'm diggin' it.

Where's keller?

Oh, great. He's
alone with that psycho?

I need him alive and able to talk.

He's in lockup, sir,
safe as a baby.

How the hell did
you get out of fuego?

What the hell are you doing?

Put down the goddamn gun, john.

Get him out of here.

Ehh, let's go!

John...

you know i'm a man of
strong beliefs.

And one of my strongest beliefs

is that when a
commander gives an order,

it's to be followed to
the goddamn letter!

It's my fault, commander.

Agent keller... save it!

You'll have my official
resignation in the morning.

John... hold on.

You want another crack at schrek?

'Cause it's clear to me, john,

you have a hard-on for that psycho.

I have a problem with
cold-blooded killers,

especially cop killers.

Could just be me.

Ok.

He's yours.

But... this is
not unconditional love, john.

There's a catch.

What?

My attitude?

No vigilante bullshit, john.

You're still a cop.

We work together on this.

Clear?

Clear.

Blaire?

Yeah.

Schrek was being transferred

to a state facility somewhere
outside of yuma

when the van blew a tire.

He killed 3 guards and a driver.

Where was the transport
heading when schrek escaped?

We don't know exactly,

and no record sindicate a transfer.

Schrek was officially executed
one month ago.

Now he turns up alive and
lethal in my jurisdiction,

and that pisses me off.

Well, now we know why.

We can't confirm any bodies.

The warden at fuego says that schrek

was being transferred to
a state facility

for psychiatrice valuation.

4 other prisons are experiencing

the same disappearances.

No bodies, no records?

Zip.

That's right.

Corpus disappear us.

So here's the deal, john:

i want you to go deep
cover into fuego.

Find out what the
fuck's going on down there.

What's my cover?

Can we talk?

Look, you go in there,

you aren't coming out.

Is that what you want?

Now, listen.

I want to know what's
going on in that prison.

Fuck you, captain ahab.

You're going after moby dick

for hurting you.

Just remember one thing...

what was that?

Revenge.

And at the end of the day,

revenge emerged victorious.

Hey, asshole.

Gun down! Freeze!

Blaire: drop the gun, keller.

What the hell have you done?

Order! Order in the court!

This court finds you
guilty, john keller,

for the aggravated and
unprovoked murders

of 2 law enforcement officers.

I'm recommending a life-term
sentence without parole.

You'll be remanded

to the
maximum-security penitentiary,

fuego penal.

John keller... a decorated
s.w.a.t. officer for this city,

now a convicted murderer...

is to serve out the rest
of his life in prison.

An isolated tragedy

or an early warning to
high-stress law enforcement agencies

that other such incidents are...

th-there he is!

Mr. Keller!

Do you feel like you
got a fair trial?

Keller, do you feel the
sentence was fair?

Right here, sir.

Preston here.

Man on telephone:
he's heading your way.

Uh, yes, i... i just read the paper.

What do we know about him?

My sources tell
me keller's case is legit.

Don't screw this up.

My bet?

He's dead by morning.

Keller is one of the
world's greatest fighters.

He is rare.

I want him.

Well, i... [dial tone]

welcome to my universe.



welcome, gentlemen, to fuego penal,

a place where you will live out

your miserable, worthless
existences indefinitely.

I'm files. Think of me as god.

Screw with me, and by
sweet, sunny jesus,

i will use your prostates

as goddamn trampolines.

Preston: hello, girls.

I'm the warden.

I have one rule in my prison.

There are no rules.

Move it, keller.

Inmate: john matthew keller,

hero of the people.

Holy shit.

Sound like you know the
man, winston.

Only what i read on the net.

Hey, billings,

wasn't keller the guy who nailed you

for armed robbery a few years back?

Yeah.

* And now i know

* there's a living god *

praise jesus.

Keller has been delivered to me.

Howdy.

Name's winston,
as in churchill.

Man with a marvelousth rift
of language.

I like that.

Yes, i do, indeed.

Shows character,
shows innate wisdom.

Shows, um... shut up.

Shows shut up. I can do that.

Hey, listen, i'm a guy that
you need to know and like.

Why?

I get things for people:

drugs, cigarettes,
good book,

even women.

I got contacts.

Well, just thought you'd
like to know.

Hey, officer keller,

meet the famous dr. Rosenbloom.

Killed his father and
mother with a corkscrew.

But don't hold that against him.

Deep down, he's a real sweetheart.

John keller.

You look much larger on television.

The first one... is free.

It's for all the pain.

Don't look now, keller,

there's a couple of good old boys

coming your way with orders to kill.

How do you know?

Got contacts, like i said.

I just did you a favor...

you owe me one.

Well...

our new playboy is
definitely a player.

Heh.

Did he... disappoint?

Absolutely not, sir.

I saw him fight once.

He was masterful.

However...

we don't want to move too quickly,

after the schrek incident.

We'll keep it simple, mr. Caesar.

Conventional indoctrination,
as per policy.

One last thing, warden.

About schrek...

how did things go so wrong?

U-uh... bad luck, sir.

The transport that was
moving schrek blew a tire.

Schrek acted quickly,

killed the guards,

escaped within minutes.

It garneredunnecessary attention.

S-s-s-such an incident

will not happen again, sir.

Good.

Keep me apprised on
keller's progress.

Files...

bring in our new guest.

[Shackles clanking]

mr. Keller.

Very impressive performance

in the kitchen this morning.

I was told they were
ordered to kill me.

Who told you that?

Heh heh.

In any case, it's probably true.

You're an ex-cop, mr. Keller.

Not a lot of people around here

have warm, fuzzy feelings for you.

However, i could
make your stay

a little more tolerable.

Interested?

If it allows me to pursue a life

of religious and
spiritual fulfilment,

of course.

I appreciate a good fighter,
mr. Keller.

Sarcasm from some
shit-fuck cop killer,

however, is something i
simply will not tolerate.

I'm prepared to make you an offer.

Listening?

I asked you a question.

Are we listening?

Yeah, i'm listening.

Good.

Pray, gentlemen, a word with you.

Apparently, some of you have
requested religious counseling.

Well, we aim to please,

so the holy sisters of mercy

have come in answer of your prayers.

Now, mind your
manners and play nice...

or i'll reach my fist so
far up your asses

i'll pull out your lungs.

Clear?

Dr. Rosenbloom:
they're all penguins!

They're all penguins! It's a
conspiracy! A conspiracy!


sister, i must talk with you.

I have sinned.

I am hereto listen to
your troubles, my son.

I can only imagine the
sick fantasies

rolling around in
your head right now.

Now that you mention it,

the outfit is kind of kinky.

Eat me.

I'm glad to see you're alive.

You got anything yet?

Nothing yet.

However, the warden runs a
small-time black-market cockfight.

He wants me to fight.

What are you gonna do?

You guys got anything yet?

Negative.

There is something, though...
what?

U.s. marshals office has a
man in here, deep cover.

Been here about a month
working on the same case.

He's their top mole,
real performer.

I'll keep an eye out for him.

When do you come back?

One week.

Same place.

Hey... what?

What kind of meat do priests eat?

Nun.

Stay safe, keller.

Hate to lose my best partner yet.

Happy trails.

Gentlemen!

One rule, and
only one rule:

there are no rules!

Billings.

Agent keller.

Long time.

What are you doing here?

I'm your corner man.

I volunteered for the job.

Any particular reason?

Because nobody's gonna
kill you but me.

When we gets quared off one day,

i'm taking you out.

Praise jesus.

That's ivan.

And looky who his corner man is.

Round one.


crowd: yeah, come on!

Man: looks like your boy's losing!

Yeah? Don't bet on it.

Crowd: come on. Go, go!

Get him, keller.

Nail him!

Get him.

Man: get off of the
rope, you idiot!

Stand up and fight!

[Bell rings]

i don't care how the fuck you do it.

Tear this motherfucker's
head off, you understand?

Break his fucking neck.

[Bell rings]

man: let's go, let's go.

Get some now, ivan. Come on!

Take him down! Take him down!

You fucking finish it,
you son of a bitch!

You finish it now!

You kill him!

Keller, you kill him!

It's over.

Goddamn you, son of a bitch!

You will!

You think you're king, are you?

I'll come down there and
get you myself!

I'll rip your skin off!

I'll kill you!

It's only a game. It's ok.

[Neck cracks]

[clock ticks]

preston: h-hello.

He... m-mr. Caesar?

Uh, hello? Hello, sir?

H-hello?

Hello? Mr. Caesar?

Goddamn phone.

Hello?!

What?

Did you see the video
of the keller fight?

Of course.

The son of a bitch refused
to go for the kill.

Have you been
monitoring his behavior?

He's been watched morning,
noon, and night.

Nothing suspicious.

Still... before
you implement.

Mr. Keller's execution...

perhaps there is a way

to erase all our doubt.

I'd like to be certain, but i...

[dial tone]


anderson: yeah, i'm sorry
to hear that, marshal.

Thanks for the tip.

Good-bye.


bad news.

They made the marshal's inside guy.

Is he still alive?

Unknown.

Their mole said he was a dead man.

They nailed them all.

They'll nail keller next.

I think we should pull him.

We can't, blaire.

Keller is now our only
link to the inside.

Commander...

keller volunteered for
this operation.

He knew the risks.

I understand your
relationship with keller.

You're a good team.

But you're still cops.

Don't forget that.

You meet with keller in a
couple of days, right?

Yep.

Well, if at that time, he
gives us any indication

his position's compromised,

we pull him.

Agreed?

Agreed.


ohh.

Contusions.

A concussion.

And, uh, subcutaneous hepatoma.

Hey, hey. Speak
english, rosenbloom.

How's he doing?

Well, basically, he's
pretty fucked up.

Ha ha ha ha.

Ohhh.

Ohhhh.

Unh.

Rosenbloom: you'll be all right.

Hey, doctor, why don't you keep

the good guard company for a while?

Paging dr. Rosenbloom.

Keller, are you clear
enough to understand me?

Yeah.

All right, listen carefully.

In another day or two,

you are going to have a visitor,

a woman, a spy.

A spy from whom?

The warden.

He suspects you of being a
deep-cover agent.

Where does the woman fit in?

Well, she's gonna keep you company

in a cell that's wired for sound.

It's an opportunity for you
to convince the warden

of your genuineness.

You're the mole.

U.s. marshal.

I've been nailed.

My days are numbered.

I understand that you are
the last line of defense.

Have you been tapped?

How could you manage this?

Well, the good dr. Rosenbloom and i

have quite a little company going.

At any rate, the warden
doesn't know who the mole is.

Not yet, anyway.

You got to get out of here.

Ha ha ha ha.

Well, if i'm still alive
in a few days,

we'll talk.

Hey.

2 days, remember.

And, keller, be convincing.

Whatever it takes, stud.

Hey, rosenbloom!

[Cell door slams]

blaire?

Where am i?

In a room.

I'm regina.

I'm your...
reward from the warden

for winning your first fight.

Well, that's very
thoughtful of the warden.

And all this time, i thought he was

a sick, twisted,
sadistic bastard...

who likes watching men sweat.

Prick.

And i was afraid you
would be too sick.

Never too sick for that.

Ow!

Ahhh.

Ohhh.


ohhh!

Ohhh.

[Regina moans]

what happened, keller?

I lost my mind.

Suddenly the gun was in my hand,

and i was firing it.

Bang, bang, and they were all dead.

That's so sad.

You don't look like a killer.

I have killed,

and i will kill again.

Would you kill me?

If you give me a reason,

i will kill you.

Promise?

Promise.


preston here.

Caesar: don't preston me.

Inform me.

He's clean.

I know you have an agent there.

Find him.

Kill him.

Make it look accidental.

We begin in 7 days.

Understood.

Sir, if i may make a suggest...

[dial tone]


[dogs barking]

winston: listen up. I
know all about your cover.

Your commander anderson communicated

to my section chief,
who then leaked

the intel down to me.

How?

Through our head guard mr. Files.

Files? But...

he knows nothing about it.

Rosenbloom and i have
got him hooked up

on a pcp-cocaine combo.

You see, files knows that rosenbloom

needs outside constituents.

So i make out my grocery
order list to my contact,

and then files hooks up
with him on the outside,

and the shit comes down
to us via single flower.

The flower's encrypted?

Acetylene?

Bingo.

Water, a little lemon juice, voila!

Invisible ink.

My plastic homing pigeon
to the outside world.

What do you know about the
missing inmates?

not much.

Men are executed on a regular basis,

ostensibly by orders of the state.

But when, uh, family or friends come

to collect the remains,

zip, nada, nothing.

This corpse-snatching, it
doesn't make any sense.

I've pressed all my sources,

but i can't figure it out.

There's no rhyme or reason

to steal dead cons.

That's about it for now.

Meet you at the mess in 20.

Aah!

Guard: go get him! Grab his arms!

Easy! Easy!

Thanks.

Like i said,
you're mine.

Only on my terms,
no one else's.

[Door opens]

hey.

What are you working on, blaire?

Oh, trying to construct a pattern

that needs a little old-fashioned
extrapolation.

5 prison facilities,

including fuego,

all within 300 miles of each other.

Connect the dots,

you have some
what of a circle.

Schrek's transport was disabled

on interstate 62 going
west out of fuego.

So somewhere within here
is our answer, huh?

Ha.

Yeah, wonderful.

Only, that leaves about
1,000 square miles

of mountain and
desert as possibilities,

and, uh, we don't even know for sure

if schrek is connected to
the missing bodies

of executed inmates.

Hmm.

Well, let's hope keller comes up

with some more useful information.

Yeah.

Have your report on my
desk in the morning.

You got it.

Go left, right.

That's it. Go, turn, turn.

Hands up. Here you go, come on.

That's it. Go, go.

That's it. Go. Left roundhouse.

Come on. Come on.

Stay back. Go back, go back.

Ok.

That's it. Stand up.

You ain't showing him right, man.

See, it's the element of surprise

that throws the enemies off.

Isn't it right, keller?

Man: this is it, man.

Watch this, boys.

I see your point.

1, 2... 3!

You picked a fine
day to die, keller.

Man: quit dancing, boys. Let's go.

Breathe, keller, breathe!

Crowd: go, go, go!

Get him!

Crowd: go, go, go! Get him!

The secret is...

one more blow, and you
snap his windpipe.

Yeah.

I... i see.

Suffocate him! Yeah!

Rosenbloom: get my glasses.

Look. See him suffocate.

Rosenbloom.

See him suffocate.

Hey, hey, hey!

Calm.

Calm, calm.easy.

You missed a
great opportunity, keller.

I just return eda favor.

I don't like debts.

Next time.

Next time, you die.


files: all right, break it up.

Break this up.

What the hell is going on?

Order just came down

from the governor, billings.

Tonight you hold
hands with jesus.

Guards: come on, let's go!

Come on, get up!

Come on, pick it up. Pick it up.

Keller!

Keller.

What?

Keller, they're coming for you.

They're coming for you.

Who?

The warden and his men.

I know what they're gonna do to you.

Just like the others.

Files: schrek first!

Save keller for last.

Do me a favor, doc.

Ha ha ha.

Time to check out, keller.

What's up, warden?

Well, that's a
good question, keller.

Here's the answer.

Tonight, you die.

Keller.

What the hell is going on?

Your execution's been
moved up, cop killer.

No reprieve, do not pass go,

do not collect $200.

I want to see a
governmental approval.

Take my word for it?

Stay back! I can break his neck.

Stay back!

This will help you relax.

Eh?

Priest: "though i walk through the
valley of the shadow of death",

i will fear no evil."

By special penal order 456.1,

john keller, i hereby authorize

your formal execution.

I have the right to an...

you have no rights, mr. Keller.

Parting is such sweet sorrow.

Priest: "be with me all
the days of my life."

[Medical equipment beeps]

[camera clicks]

no, you can't do this.


keller: no, you can't do this!

No!

You can't do this!

No!


what is it?

John's dead.

No.

It's a mistake.

It's over, christy.

It's over.

He's not dead.

He's not dead.

I know keller.

He is the most
unstoppables on of a bitch

on the planet.

Nobody's unstoppable, christy.

Not even john fucking keller.

I'm staying on this.

You're too close to this.

Go home. That's an order.

It's company policy.

Oh, don't give me that company
policy bullshit, anderson.

You sent him in.

You're on indefinite leave

until further notice, agent blaire.

Screw you.

I'd like to speak with
john keller's cellmate.


you're keller's sister friend.

This poor troubled soul over there

would like to speak with me.

Move closer to the glass.

Move closer.

I can't see you.

Move... closer.

Move closer.

Where is he?

Move closer.

Please, move closer.

Move closer.

Look into my eyes.

Can you see my soul? Ha ha ha.

Creep!

Ahh. I have something for you...

from john keller.

Guard: all right, time's up.

Let's go.

I know where he is.

Let's go.

Where is he?

The gates of heaven.

People talk when they're
flying high.


rosenbloom: bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Mmph.

Preston: welcome, gentlemen.

[Medical equipment beeps]

keller: where am i?

Winston: it ain't club
med, i can tell you that.

What's up, warden?

Ever the inquisitive one,

aren't you, keller?

Well, don't worry.

Everything will be made
clear soon enough.

In the meanwhile...
get some rest.

Preston: oh, and by the way...

no quarreling.

If any of you even thinks of
stepping out of line,

the punishment is simple...

death by slow torture.

Get some rest, ladies.

Hi, keller.

Hey.

Happy you could join the party.

Well, at least we're getting
closer to solving our mystery

of missing corpses, huh?

Let's hope we find out

before we end up corpses ourselves.

[Blaire sniffs]



[dogs whimpering]

welcome, john keller.

Why am i here?

Why, mr. Keller?

To do what you do best:

fight.

You are the only one of your kind,

so we had to have you.

So what's your excuse?

I guess we have something in common.

Mr. Keller.

A great honor.

I'm justin caesar.

This is my humble, little home.

Amenities completed.

Mr. Keller, now...

down to business.

Mr. Keller...

you are here to participate

in an ancient ritual,

the ritual of kumite.

Kumite?

Ahhh.

You know of it.

Keller: the origin of
kumite are japanese,

second dynasty.

It's a thousand years old.

It's the most sacred event

for the ancient samurai warriors.

Hmmm.

Very good.

Only, this kumite
is to the death.

What do you want from me?

I need your spirit

and your dedication to survival.

You brought us here to
murder one another.

Mr. Keller, you misunderstand caesar.

You see, he's actually performing

a service to you and
these other men.

Is that how you see it?

You will fight.

If you win,

you'll be granted your freedom...

and one million
dollars with plane fare

out of the country.

If you lose...

well... if you lose,

you'll not need plane fare
where you'll be going.

Bring in the next man.

I love you.




ha ha!

[Quick music beat plays]

ladies and gentlemen...
friends,

welcome to kumite.

As you are aware,

this will be our final performance.

But i guarantee you,

it will be an
experience of a lifetime.

Inside these pens,

we have the finest selection of
warriors we have ever assembled:

masters of savate...

mui thai, judo, jujitsu, boxing,

wrestling, and, uh...
let's not forget

about the eclectic.

They are here...
for you.

So without any further ado,

your host... justin caesar.

Hail, caesar! Hail, caesar!

Ladies and gentlemen,

as the romans of yesteryear

once heralded before such events,

let me now say...

let the games... begin!


[cheering and screaming]

ladies and gentlemen, we
start this evening's feast

with a tasty appetizer.

I have a revelation, my dear...

that mr. Keller is an...

undercover agent.

How could he, then,
kill an associate?

A pity.
