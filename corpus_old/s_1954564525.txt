    YOU'RE LOOKING AT GARY,     
        INDIANA, U.S.A.,        

    A CITY WITH THE HIGHEST     
    MURDER RATE IN AMERICA,     

        MAYBE THE WORLD.        

    A FACTORY TOWN THAT SOMEHOW 
        BECAME A GANG TOWN.     

    BACK IN THE FIFTIES,        

    THE COMMUNITY WAS SUPPORTED 
    BY THE U.S. STEEL MILL.     

    IT WAS DAMN HARD WORK,      

    BUT PEOPLE RAISED           
    THEIR FAMILIES WELL.        

    THEN JUST 20 YEARS LATER,   
        WITHOUT WARNING,        

    US STEEL SHUT DOWN          
    70% OF THE MILL.            

AT FIRST, THE WORKERS THOUGHT   
    IT WAS TEMPORARY,           

        BUT IT WASN'T.          

    THEIR SAVINGS WENT,         
    UNEMPLOYMENT RAN OUT,       

        AND SLOWLY,             
    THE FORMER STEELWORKERS     

    LOST THE LAST TWO THINGS    
        THEY HAD LEFT--         

    THEIR PRIDE AND THEIR HOPE. 

    AND THAT HAS BEEN           
    THE INHERITANCE             

    OF THE CHILDREN OF GARY.    

    THIS WAS THE PALACE         
        MOVIE THEATER.          

     THE LAST MOVIE THAT PLAYED 
         HERE WAS <i>STAR WARS.</i>    

    THAT'S THE BAKERY.          

        IT USED TO MAKE         
        THE BEST DAMN           

    GLAZED AND CHOCOLATE        
    DOUGHNUTS IN TOWN.          

        THAT'S WHERE            
HAYNES' RESTAURANT ONCE STOOD.  

    THEY HAD THE BEST           
    BARBECUED RIBS.             

            THIS IS             
    THE MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM--   

        HOME OF TWO STATE       
    BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS.   

    MORE THAN 350,000 BACK THEN.

        NOW THERE'S             
    ONLY 150,000 LEFT           

    THAT STILL CALL GARY        
        THEIR HOME.             

    THIS ABANDONED STEEL MILL   
        IS NOW HEADQUARTERS     

        TO A GANG CALLED        
        THE DIABLOS.            

    AND THE OLD TRAIN DEPOT     
IS A HANGOUT FOR THEIR RIVALS-- 

        THE REBELS.             

HEY, PUNK!                      

                FUCK HIM, MAN!  

WHAT'S UP, PUNK?                
YOU READY FOR THE BALL?         

                I WANT IT.      
                YOU GOT IT?     

YO, SHUT UP!                    

    HE'LL KNOCK YOUR ASS OUT!   

SHUT UP! SHOOT! SHOOT!          

        OH! THAT'S SHIT!        

I DON'T KNOW WHERE              
THE BROTHER'S FROM,             

BUT THAT SHIT                   
IS NOT RIGHT.                   

    YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE. 

            GRAMS.              

        COME HERE, MAN.         

                NICE GAME, MAN. 

GET THE FUCK

                WHAT'S UP, MAN? 

    YOU DID GOOD OUT THERE.     

                THANKS, MAN.    
                APPRECIATE IT.  

    WHERE YOU LEARN             
    TO PLAY LIKE THAT?          

                JUST A LITTLE   
                SOMETHING       

                I PICKED UP     
                ON THE STREET,  
                THAT'S ALL.     

    GOING TO COME BACK,         
    GIVE US A CHANCE            

        TO WIN SOME OF          
        THAT PAPER BACK?        

                I GOT A LITTLE  
                TRIP TO TAKE    
                OUT OF TOWN,

                AT EVERYBODY.

    YEAH, GIVE                  
    THE MAN HIS DUE.            

                THANKS, MAN.    

        IF IT WERE UP TO ME,    
        YOU WOULDN'T GET SHIT.  

                I'M JUST HERE   
                TO PLAY, MAN,   
                THAT'S ALL.     

                EXCUSE ME.      

YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE       
OF THAT PUNK HUSTLER, RIGHT?    

    YEAH, YOU KNOW I AM.

    KAYO.

                    I GOT THAT. 

I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUT         
THAT BOOKMAN STORE.

I BELIEVE                       
IN THE HONOR SYSTEM.            

        OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

    YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?         

        YES, IT IS.             

        IF THEY KNOW            
        WE MADE THE CAR,        

        THEY KNOW WHERE         
        WE GOT THE INFORMATION. 

THE MONEY'S STILL               
IN THE TILL.                    

GO ON AND GET IT.               

                IT AIN'T

            WHY WOULD YOU DO    
            THAT?               

            WE AIN'T NEVER

                HE WAS SHOT     
                IN THE SHOULDER,

                BUT THE DOCTOR  
                SAID HE'D LIVE. 

    AND HOW YOU HOLDING UP?     

            I'M DOING FINE NOW. 

        SIS.

            WELL...             

        I'M NOT GOING           
        INTO THE STORE TODAY.   

    I SHOULD'VE MADE YOU        
    LEAVE HERE A LONG TIME AGO. 

        WHEN IS THE LAST TIME   
        ANYBODY MADE HIM DO     
        ANYTHING?               

    POPS, THIS PLACE            
    IS JUST NOT RIGHT--         

                THIS PLACE WAS  
                A GOOD PLACE.   

                I COME HERE     
                WITH NOTHING.   

                GOT A JOB       
                AT U.S. STEEL.  

YEAH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.         

THE DAY THE WAR ENDED           

YOU QUIT THE MILL               
WITH $9,500 IN THE BANK.        

            MARRIED YOUR MOTHER,

            BOUGHT THE STORE.   

        IF I STAYED IN THE MILL,

        I MIGHT'VE MADE FOREMAN,

            BUT I'D BE          
            OUT OF WORK BY NOW. 

            MAYBE LIVING

            AND WIND UP SLEEPING
            IN A CARDBOARD BOX  
            IN A DOORWAY.       

            IS IT ANY WONDER

    STAR.                       

        THAT'S THE PROBLEM.     

        THEY GOT THE MONEY.     
        THEY GOT THE POWER.     

        THEY RUN THE STREETS.   

        THAT'S NOT EVEN         
        WHAT IT'S ABOUT.        

I REMEMBER                      
IT USED TO BE                   
ABOUT GETTING OUT.              

        NOT THIS BUNCH.         
        THEY DON'T WANT         
        TO GET OUT.             

        THERE'S NO PLACE        
        FOR THEM TO GO.         

        THERE'S NOTHING         
        OUT THERE FOR THEM.     

        THEY'RE MORE SCARED     
        OF LIVING THAN DYING.   

        THEY DON'T CRY.         
        THEY DON'T MOURN.       

        THEY JUST KILL          
        EACH OTHER!             

        THAT'S THE DESTINY      
        OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE.   

        I JUST DIDN'T THINK     
        IT WOULD HAPPEN         
        TO KENNY.               

WHAT'S HAPPENING                
TO OUR CITY, HUH?               

        IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME   
        SINCE WE OWNED          
        THE STREETS.            

    ¶ THERE'S A HUSTLER         
        ON THE RISE ¶           

    ¶ GOT TO GET BY ¶           

        ¶ GET BY ¶

¶ THERE'S A HUSTLER             
ON THE RISE ¶                   

¶ OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ¶        

    ¶ THE SITUATION IS SUCH ¶   

    ¶ THAT MY OCCUPATION        
        IS BIG TIME ¶           

        OH, FUCK THAT, DALE!    

        TALKING ALL THAT        
        GOOFY SHIT.             

        LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

YEAH, YEAH.                     

        HEY, STEP ON OUT, MAN.  

        ALL RIGHT, BASE.        

WHAT'S UP,                      
DELIVERY BOY?                   

WHAT THE FUCK                   
YOU DOING HERE?                 

    SOMEBODY PLACE A ORDER      
    AROUND THIS MOTHERFUCKER?   

            HUH?                

GIVE ME THIS                    
MOTHERFUCKING BALL.             

                ALL RIGHT, KAYO.

SEE YOU LATER, SUCKER.          

                WHAT THE FUCK   
                YOU WANT, MAN?  

                WHAT THE FUCK   
                YOU WANT?       

I WAS JUST WATCHING.            

        TAKE YOUR ASS           
        ON OVER THERE AND WATCH.

    ¶ WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL ¶  

    ¶ COME ON, COME ON          
    COME ON, COME ON ¶          

        ¶ OH OOH... ¶           

HEY!                            
HEY, JOHNNY!                    

HEY, MAN, I DON'T WANT          
YOUR DAMN AUTOGRAPH.            

IT'S ME, MAN.                   

WHAT, YOU COME BACK HERE        

LOOKING FOR A FRESH MARK        
TO HUSTLE OR WHAT?              

            BUBBA, IS THAT YOU, 
            MAN?                

IT'S ME.                        
STILL HERE.                     

I'VE AGED A LITTLE BIT,         

BUT SO HAVE YOU.                

YOU BETTER                      
SUCK THAT GUT IN.               

            TELL ME.            
            HOW IS UNCLE BENNY? 

WELL, UNCLE BENNY               
CLOSED HIS CANDY STORE          
A WHILE BACK                    

AND DIED A FEW WEEKS LATER,     

I GUESS,                        
OF NOTHING TO DO.               

                WOW, I'M SORRY. 

DIDN'T YOUR FOLKS               
WRITE YOU ABOUT IT?             

        I DON'T KNOW, MAN.      
        THEY COULD HAVE.        

        I JUST DON'T REMEMBER.  
        THAT'S ALL.             

OH, I SEE. WELL...              

I AIN'T SEEN YOU                
BACK HERE AT ALL, MAN.          

                NO, NO,         
                I'VE BEEN BACK. 

A QUICKIE                       
TO SEE YOUR PARENTS?            

YOU KNOW, FLYING IN             
IN THE MORNING                  

AND LEAVING                     
RIGHT BACK OUT AT NIGHT?        

THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE         
TO RUN INTO US, RIGHT?          

            WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

            I'M HERE, ALL RIGHT?

YEAH, YOU HERE.                 

WELL, LOOK.                     

DID YOU THINK IT WAS            
GOING TO BE LIKE IT WAS?        

I MEAN, YOU AND US REBELS       
RUNNING AROUND DRINKING,        

SCREWING ALL AROUND             
THE PLACE?                      

YOU THOUGHT IT WAS              
GOING TO BE LIKE THAT?          

IT AIN'T, 'CAUSE                
ALL YOU ALL LEFT.               

WE AIN'T GOT ENOUGH             
PEOPLE LEFT HERE                

TO TAKE CARE                    
OF THIS PLACE.                  

NOT EVEN.                       

YOU SHOULD'VE COME BACK         
ONCE IN A WHILE, JOHNNY.        

        I DON'T GET IT.         
        WHAT'S HERE FOR YOU?    

        IF YOU HAD ANY SENSE,   
        YOU'D GET OUT, TOO.     

OH, MAN.                        

YOU GOING BACK AGAIN            
TOMORROW,                       

AND FRANKLY,                    
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK             
WHAT YOU THINK.                 

FUCK YOU, MOTHERFUCKER.         

        ¶ SHOUT IT ¶            

    ¶ ON THE STREETS ¶          

OUR GUEST TODAY                 
IS JOHNNY BOOKMAN,              

LOCAL STAR                      
AT NORTHWESTERN,                

ALL-AMERICAN,                   
AND NFL STAR.                   

HEY, JOHN, THANKS               
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY.        

        THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME  
        THE TIME.               

            SPY, GET THE HELL   
            OVER HERE!          

    BE COOL, BABY.              

 JOHN, EVERYONE                 
 AT THE STATION WAS SORRY       

 TO HEAR ABOUT THE ASSAULT      
 AND ROBBERY ON YOUR FATHER.    

         <i>FIRST OF ALL,</i>          

         <i>LET ME SET</i>             
         <i>THE RECORD STRAIGHT.</i>   

         <i>THERE WAS</i>              
         <i>A GANG SHOOTING</i>        
         <i>IN FRONT OF HIS STORE.</i> 

    DAMN, HE AIN'T              
    A BAD-LOOKING OLD MAN.      

             <i>THE POLICE FAILED</i>  
             <i>TO GIVE HIM</i>        
             <i>PROPER PROTECTION.</i> 

 <i>ALL THE REPORTS WERE</i>           
 <i>HE WAS ROBBED.</i>                 

         <i>THEY CAME IN HIS STORE</i> 
         <i>JUST TO KILL HIM.</i>      

         <i>THEY UNDERESTIMATED</i>    
         <i>HIS SPIRIT.</i>            

                UNDERESTIMATE   
                HIS SPIRIT!     

I THOUGHT BOOKMAN'S             
FATHER WAS DEAD!                

BOBBY WAS SUPPOSED              
TO HAVE KILLED HIM.             

        SHOULD'VE LET ME        
        HAVE HIM.               

    I COULD'VE DONE BETTER.     

                 <i>HE REPORTED</i>    
                 <i>WHAT HE SAW.</i>   

                 <i>ISN'T THAT WHAT</i>
                 <i>WE SHOULD DO?</i>  

    NOW, NOW, THAT'S SNITCHING  
        RIGHT THERE.            

YOUR FAMILY'S GONE.             

                HE DESERVED     
                THAT SHIT.      

     <i>PISSED OFF AT MAYOR RITTER,</i>

         <i>WHO RAN ON</i>             
     <i>THE LAW AND ORDER TICKET.</i>  

     <i>HE'S TURNING HIS BACK</i>      
     <i>ON THE PEOPLE...</i>           

            CROOKED-ASS MOUTH!  

    DAMN.                       

         <i>I WANT TO SAY THIS</i>     
         <i>TO THOSE PUNKS</i>         

         <i>WHO DID THIS</i>           
         <i>TO MY FATHER.</i>          

     <i>YOU'LL HAVE TO MEET UP</i>     
     <i>WITH ME REAL SOON.</i>         

WE'RE GOING TO GET              
THAT ASS JOHN BOOKMAN.          

THANKS FOR BEING                
ON THE SHOW, JOHN.              

THERE'S A PHONE CALL            
FOR YOU--                       
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.             

                NO SHIT.        

                WHAT TOOK HIM   
                SO LONG?        

            SO TELL ME,         

            WHAT ARE YOU        
            GOING TO DO         
            ABOUT THESE GANGS?  

    FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,     

        YOU USED TO BE          
        A GANG MEMBER,          

        A FOUNDING MEMBER       
        OF THE REBS.            

            YEAH, THAT'S TRUE...

            BUT WE DIDN'T       
            KILL PEOPLE.        

YES, BUT, UH...                 

YOU STARTED SOMETHING,          

AND IT'S OUT                    
OF CONTROL NOW.                 

            BECAUSE YOU LET IT. 

DON'T LAY                       
THIS SHIT ON ME!                

YOU ARE PISSED OFF              
BECAUSE YOU'VE                  
BECOME A VICTIM                 

OF SOMETHING                    
YOU STARTED YOURSELF.           

    YOU SEE, MR. BOOKMAN,       

    I'M AFRAID THAT IS          
    YOUR LEGACY TO GARY.        

    SO DON'T BE COMING IN HERE  

    WAVING THAT LITTLE CIGAR    
    AROUND, BLAMING US.         

MY OWN FATHER WORKED            
IN THE STEEL MILLS              

AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED          
ON THE JOB.                     

THE COMPANY SETTLEMENT          
PUT ME THROUGH LAW SCHOOL.      

I CAME BACK.                    
WHERE WERE YOU                  
ALL THESE YEARS?                

        LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT ME.

        LET'S TALK              
        ABOUT THE LOUSY JOB     
        YOU'VE DONE.            

            SO YOU THINK        
            IF WE GO OUT        

            AND FOCUS           
            ON THIS AREA,       

            CRIME IS GOING      
            TO DRY UP.          

    LIGHTEN UP, HUH?            

    CALM DOWN.                  

                    ALL RIGHT,  
                    ALL RIGHT.  

    NOW, OUR MAIN CONCERN HERE  

        IS THE SAFETY           
        OF YOUR FAMILY.         

    THEREFORE, I SUGGEST        
    WE SET UP A MEETING         

    WITH REVEREND DORSEY        
    AT THE CHRISTIAN CHAPEL.    

SO WHAT'S REVEREND DORSEY       
GOING TO DO?                    

            THE REVEREND SERVES 
            AS AN INTERMEDIARY  

            BETWEEN THE GANGS.  

WHAT ARE YOU                    
TELLING ME?                     

YOU'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE       
WITH THESE PUNKS?               

    THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.       

    UNLESS, OF COURSE,          
        MR. BOOKMAN,            

        YOU HAVE                
    A BETTER SUGGESTION.        

            MICHAEL, THAT'S     
            A HELL OF AN IDEA.  

        THANK YOU, SIR.         
        THANK YOU.              

    YEAH.                       

RIGHT. O.K.                     

SET IT UP.                      

                    GOOD.       

AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,         

LIKE YOU SAID, MR. MAYOR,       

I STARTED THE REBELS.           
I CAN TERMINATE THEM.           

    I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU  
        FOR COMING.             

    I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED     

    ABOUT THE VIOLENCE          
        IN OUR CITY.            

    I JUST HAD A LONG TALK      
        WITH THE MAYOR.         

                WHAT EXACTLY    
                DID YOU DISCUSS?

    WHAT HE HAS TO DO.          

        HE'LL DO THEM           
    OR FIND A NEW MAYOR.        

         <i>¶ WHEN I DIE</i>           
         <i> HALLELUJAH,</i>

            THE CHOIR CAN TAKE  
            A 10-MINUTE BREAK.  

    REVEREND, ARE YOU GOING     
        TO BE ALL RIGHT?        

I'LL BE FINE.                   
Y'ALL JUST GET SOME AIR.        

    AHEM!                       

                YOU REQUESTED   
                OUR PRESENCE?   

YES. THE MAYOR                  
CALLED ME TODAY.                

    AND HOW IS OUR FRIEND       
        THE MAYOR?              

VERY UPSET.                     

ESPECIALLY OVER THIS            
GROCERY STORE BUSINESS.         

            OH, YEAH.           
            I HEARD SOMETHING   
            ABOUT THAT.         

            I HEARD THE OLD MAN 
            HAD A CHATTERY SIDE.

NOW, MARVIN BOOKMAN             
IS AN OLD MAN.                  

YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES         
OLD MEN MAKE MISTAKES.          

    OLD MEN BETTER LEARN,       
        REVEREND.               

WELL, SOMETIMES                 
WE HAVE TO REACH                
DEEP WITHIN OURSELVES           

TO FIND FORGIVENESS.            

PERHAPS I SHOULD                
ALSO MENTION                    

THAT JOHNNY BOOKMAN IS          
A VERY HIGH-PROFILE PERSON.     

            I MET THE GREAT MAN.

            I WASN'T IMPRESSED. 

THE MEDIA, BROTHERS.            

IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD      

DOING BUSINESS                  
IN A GOLDFISH BOWL.             

THE MAYOR CAN'T LOOK            
THE OTHER WAY FOREVER.          

            SO SHINE HIM ON.    

            GET BOOKMAN         
            ON A PLANE OUT.     

            IS THAT YOUR SERMON 
            OF THE DAY?         

LOOK...                         

I'M JUST TRYING                 
TO KEEP PEACE                   
IN THE COMMUNITY.               

            AS ALWAYS,          
            YOU MAKE GOOD SENSE,
            REVEREND.           

            THE REBS WILL TALK  
            TO THE FAMILY.      

            WHAT ELSE YOU GET   
            OUT OF THIS?        

WELL, I AM NEGOTIATING          

FOR AN EXPANSION                
OF MY HOMELESS SHELTER.         

PERHAPS A GESTURE               
OF BROTHERLY LOVE

I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, MAN.      

I WAS HOME                      
WATCHING TV ONE NIGHT.          

I WAS WATCHING                  
PAY-PER-VIEW.                   

I SAW YOUR BOY FIGHT.           

THIS GUY WENT PLUNK!            

            OH, MAN,            
            DON'T GO THERE.     

            I GAVE THE KID      
            HIS SHOT.           

            HE GOT KNOCKED DOWN 
            IN TWO ROUNDS.      
            SO WHAT?            

YEAH, RIGHT.                    
TELL ME SOMETHING,              

YOU STILL                       
IN CLEVELAND, RIGHT?            

            YEAH, MAN,          
            I'M IN CLEVELAND    

            TRAINING            
            SOME NEW TALENT.    

            YOU KNOW, JOHNNY,   
            THESE KIDS ARE      
            NOT LIKE US.        

            THEY DON'T WANT     
            TO WORK.            

            ALL THEY WANT       
            IS MONEY.           

            I GOT 20 YEARS      
            ON MOST OF THESE    
            SUCKERS.            

            I CAN STILL         
            KICK THEIR BUTTS!   

WHOA, WHOA!                     

CHILL OUT, BROTHER.             

LOOK, I KNOW WHERE              
YOU'RE COMING FROM, MAN,        

BUT I KNOW YOU DIDN'T           
COME ALL THE WAY TO GARY        

TO HELP ME                      
IN SOME STREET FIGHT.           

                I CAME BACK     
                TO BURY KENNY.  

LAURIE'S SON?                   

                    OUR SON.    

A SON?                          

DAMN, I'M SORRY, JAKE.          

            I NEVER KNEW HIM,   
            JOHNNY.             

            HEARD HE WAS        
            A GREAT ATHLETE.    

WHAT HAPPENED                   
BETWEEN YOU AND LAURIE?         

        IT WAS OVER BETWEEN US  

        WHEN SHE FOUND OUT      
        SHE WAS PREGNANT.       

        YOU KNOW LAURIE--       
        STRONG, BLACK WOMAN.    

        SHE MADE IT CLEAR       
        SHE WANTED THE BABY,    
        BUT NOT ME.             

DID HE KNOW                     
YOU WERE THE FATHER?            

        YEAH, SHE TOLD HIM      
        WHEN HE WAS 9 YEARS OLD.

        LOOK, I SENT MONEY.     
        I DID EVERYTHING.       

        SHE NEVER               
        CASHED MY CHECKS.       

        I DID THE BEST          
        I COULD DO.             

        SHE WANTED ME TO KNOW   
        THEY DIDN'T NEED ME.    

THERE'S LOTS                    
WE'D BOTH LIKE                  
TO LEAVE IN THE PAST.

                    YEAH.       

THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.            

NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT

IT ISN'T ABOUT                  
ROCKS AND BOTTLES

ALL RIGHT.

        THAT'S WHAT             
        YOU'RE TELLING ME?      

NO, WHAT I'M TRYING             
TO TELL YOU IS                  

THEY DIDN'T KILL HIM            
OVER THE MONEY.                 

THEY KILLED HIM                 
BECAUSE HE WAS                  
HUSTLING THEM.                  

IT AIN'T ABOUT                  
BREAKING FINGERS ANYMORE.

                THEN I'LL TAKE  
                CARE OF THIS.

WAIT A MINUTE.                  

I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU

I DON'T KNOW WHAT               
YOU GUYS ARE UP TO,             

BUT I'LL BET                    
THERE'LL BE CHANGES             
IN THIS TOWN.

JOHNNY WENT ON                  
SOME TV SHOWS,                  

AND SOME NEWSPAPERS             
PICKED UP THE STORY.            

I READ IT SOMEWHERE.            

YOU KNOW,                       
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED ME.        

            I JUST DIDN'T WANT  
            ANY MORE KILLING.   

WHAT DO YOU THINK               
I'LL DO,                        

JUST FORGET WHAT                
THEY DID TO KENNY?              

        IT WON'T BE FOR KENNY.  

        IT'LL BE                
        FOR JAKE TREVOR,        

        WHO'S ALWAYS            
        LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.    

        WHO'S ALWAYS            
        GOT TO HIT SOMEBODY,    

        EVEN IF IT MAKES        
        EVERYTHING WORSE!       

        GIVE ME THAT!           

WHAT'S UP, JAKE?                

            OH, MAN.            

        I FOUND OUT WHY         
        THEY KILLED KENNY, MAN. 

        THE REBELS HAD          
        A B-BALL RACKET GOING.  

        KENNY MADE A SLICK MOVE 
        ON THEM.                

DOES LAURIE                     
KNOW ABOUT THIS?                

            NO, SHE DON'T KNOW  
            ABOUT IT YET.       

        THAT'S THE WAY          
        I WANT TO KEEP IT, MAN. 

            YOU READY TO MAKE   
            THIS HIT WITH ME?   

HEY, MAN, SLOW DOWN.            

I GOT A MEETING TOMORROW        
WITH THE REBELS                 

AT THE CHURCH                   
ON 35th STREET.                 

                    WHAT FOR?   

SET UP A TRUCE.                 
START A DIALOG.                 

            YOU MUST BE         
            OUT OF YOUR MIND.   

            I NEVER THOUGHT     
            YOU'D SELL OUT!     

HEY, HEY.  COME ON, JAKE.       
THIS IS ME YOU TALKIN' TO !     

        IT AIN'T GOING          
        TO COME DOWN THAT WAY!  

BULLSHIT! YOU KNOW              
AS WELL I KNOW                  

YOU GOT TO HAVE POWER           
TO MAKE A TRUCE.                

WHERE'S YOUR POWER,             
JOHNNY?                         

                    ALL YOU WANT
                    IS REVENGE? 

DAMN RIGHT,                     
I WANT REVENGE!                 

    WHAT I WANT HERE            
    IS A LITTLE RESPECT!        

            TAKE THIS OUT       
            TO THE STREET!      

HAVE YOU HEARD?                 

OUR GOOD FRIEND JOHNNY          
WANTS TO MAKE A TRUCE           

WITH THE PEOPLE                 
THAT KILLED OUR SON.            

            AND LET THEM        
            OFF THE HOOK?       

    NO, I WANT THEM ARRESTED    
        AND PUT ON TRIAL.       

            IT WON'T            
            HAPPEN THAT FAST.   

            THEY GOT A LOCK     
            ON THE POLITICIANS. 

            WE GOT              
            TO NEGOTIATE.       

            WE DON'T LIKE       
            WHAT THEY SAY,      
            WE GO ANOTHER WAY.  

    I WANT TO BE THERE.         

            I WAS HOPING        
            YOU'D BOTH BE THERE.

YEAH, WELL,                     
YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT.           

LET ME TELL                     
BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING.          

I KNOW                          
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.              

                AW, JAKE, MAN.  

                COME ON.        
                HEY, JAKE!

         OH, <i>THOSE</i> BOOKMANS!    

        YOU FUCK WITH THEM?     

    HELL, NO. I WANT TO         
    BURN THEIR SHIT DOWN.       

            THEY DON'T EVEN     
            ACCEPT FOOD STAMPS. 

COME ON, MAN!                   
WHY WE NEED ALL THIS?           

IT AIN'T COOL

HEY, FUCK THE BOOKMANS!         

            GET UP OUTTA HERE!  

THIS THE MAN                    
THAT SHOT YOU?                  

FOUND HIM TODAY.                

                THAT'S HIM.     

    HMM.                        

            HE SAID HE WAS GOD, 

            THAT HE COULDN'T    
            BRING HIMSELF       
            TO KILL ME.         

    AND THE GUN CHECKS OUT.     

    LOOKS LIKE YOU WIN          
    THIS ONE, COACH.            

NO, NO, NOT YET.                

        YOU GOT WHAT YOU        
        NEGOTIATED FOR.         

        THEY GAVE YOU           
        THIS KID BOBBY.         

        LAW OF THE JUNGLE.      
        LIFE FOR A LIFE.        

BUT SUPPOSE                     
I WANT MORE?                    

SUPPOSE I WANT                  
ALL OF THEM,                    

DAMIEN, SPYRO,                  
INCLUDED?                       

        I'D WALK AWAY A WINNER  
        IF I WERE YOU, COACH.   

        THEY MADE THE GESTURE.  

        I SAY ACCEPT IT         
        AND WALK AWAY.          

A KID WAS MURDERED,             
EXECUTED.                       

DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?        

            WE COULDN'T DO      
            BETTER THAN THAT.   

            BOOKMAN, YOU GOT    
            A CONVICTION,       
            A SENTENCE,         

            AND AN EXECUTION.   

            WHAT IS             
            YOUR PROBLEM?       

MY PROBLEM IS,                  
YOU'RE IN MY FATHER'S ROOM.     

YOU WANT TO GET OUT?            

    [ANGRY MURMURING]           

    HOLD IT!                    

WE'RE STILL                     
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.            

I WANT YOU                      
TO REMEMBER THAT.               

I TALKED TO JOHNNY              
AND GRACIE.                     

YOU KNOW THEM.                  

THEY'RE JUST AS UPSET           
AS YOU ARE.                     

                THEY BROUGHT IT 
                ON THEMSELVES.  

NO! NO, DON'T SAY THAT.         

THEY DIDN'T BRING IT            
ON THEMSELVES.                  

        WE GOT TO MAKE 'EM GO   
        FOR OUR OWN SAKE!       

ANNIE, HOW CAN YOU,             
OF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM,        
SAY THAT?                       

YOU LOST TWO SONS               
TO DRIVE-BYS.                   

    JOHN.                       

MY FAMILY REGRETS THE PROBLEMS  
    THAT YOU'RE HAVING.         

    BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS,    

        TO SURVIVE--            
    IS THAT ALL YOU WANT?       

    YOU WANT EVERYTHING         
    TO BE ALL RIGHT.            

    WELL, EVERYTHING            
    WON'T BE ALL RIGHT          

    BECAUSE ONCE                
    THE GANGS FIND OUT          

    THAT THEY CAN RUN US OUT,   

    YOUR LIFE IS GOING          
    TO BE A LIVING HELL.        

            YOU SURE CAN        
            TALK THE TALK.      

            YOU MEAN YOU WANT US
            TO SHOOT IT OUT     
            WITH THE REBS?      

    MRS. JONES, I'M PROBABLY    
    A VERY LUCKY PERSON         

    BECAUSE I CAN AFFORD        
    TO TAKE MY FAMILY           
    OUT OF HERE.                

    IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,    
    THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.        

    BUT IT'S UP TO YOU          
        TO DECIDE               

    WHETHER YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD'S 
        WORTH FIGHTING FOR.     

                    HOW WE GONNA
                    DO THAT?    

                YEAH, TELL US   
                SOMETHING.      

        LOOK.                   

    THEIR POWER LIES            
    IN THEIR UNITY.             

    A GANG WORKS TOGETHER       
    AS A TEAM.                  

THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.      

WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER        
LIKE A TEAM.                    

IF THEY FIGHT ONE OF US,        

THEY FIGHT ALL OF US.           

    EVERY NOW AND THEN,         

        GOD TESTS US.           

    NOT IN OUR FAITH IN HIM,    

    BUT IN OUR INNER COURAGE,   

    WHETHER WE'RE WILLING TO PUT
    OUR BODIES ON THE LINE.     

        NOW, I THINK            
    MR. BOOKMAN IS RIGHT,       

        SO I'M WILLING          
        TO FOLLOW HIM.          

        AND I PRAY              
    THAT YOU WILL, TOO.

                FOR A FUCKIN'   
                $300 HUSTLE?    

                WAS THAT GOOD   
                FOR BUSINESS?   

    LOOK, THE MEDIA COVERAGE IS 
    SCARING OUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS.

    THEY CUTTING BACK           
    ON THE HIGH-GRADE SHIT.     

YOU LET THEM KNOW               
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.     

            YOUR ACTIONS        
            ARE SCARING PEOPLE  
            ON MY STREETS.      

            WE HAVE PEOPLE      
            WITH FAMILIES THERE.

WE'RE NOT BEHIND YOU            
ON THIS.                        

YOU CROSS OVER

            WELL, I HOPE YOU DO,

O.K., REVEREND,                 
LAY IT OUT FOR US.              

    THE RED IS THE EL DIABLOS,  
        THE REBS ARE GRAY,      

        AND THE YELLOW          
    IS THE RANGERS' TERRITORY.  

            WHAT'S TO STOP THEM 
            FROM JOINING FORCES?

    THE RANGERS                 
    AND THE DIABLOS?            

    I DON'T THINK SO.           

            WHAT IF THE REBS    
            THINK THEY ARE?     

            WE GOT TO PIT       
            ALL THREE GANGS     
            AGAINST EACH OTHER. 

            BREAK THE TRUCE.    

            THEN THEY'LL        
            KNOCK EACH OTHER OFF
            FOR US.             

        [REVEREND]              
    WHAT IF THEY CATCH ON?      

        WILL WE FIGHT           
        ALL THREE GANGS         
        TOGETHER ALONE?         

WAIT A MINUTE.                  

THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.             

WE GOT TO GET SOMEBODY          
ON THE INSIDE                   

THAT CAN SET THEM UP.           

                THAT'LL WORK.   

AND, REVEREND...                

WE NEED SOMEBODY                
THAT THE GANGS TRUST.           

            [CREAK]             

                    WHO IS IT?  

I DON'T KNOW,                   
BUT TAKE THE BACK WAY OUT.      

            I THINK I BETTER.   

WHERE DO YOU THINK              
YOU'RE GOING?                   

            GET OFF ME!         

            NOW SIT DOWN.       

        WHAT'LL WE DO           
        WITH THIS LITTLE PUNK?  

MAYBE WE OUGHT                  
TO JUST KILL HIM.               

            I WAS THINKING ABOUT
            SHOOTING HIM MYSELF.

WE CAN'T SHOOT HIM              
IN A COMMUNITY REC CENTER.      

BESIDES, WE GOT TO              
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE               
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.               

    YOU DON'T SCARE ME.         
        I'M A REB.              

            MAN,                
            YOU AIN'T NO REB.   

            THEY WOULDN'T LET   
            SQUIRTS IN THE REBS.

WE KNOW BECAUSE                 
WE STARTED THEM.                

    YEAH, WHEN THERE WERE       
    STILL DINOSAURS.            

            YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH.

YOU DON'T KNOW                  
NOTHING, MAN.                   

                    AND YOU KNOW
                    EVERYTHING. 

        I KNOW YOU'LL DIE       
    WITH THAT DUMB-ASS PLAN.    

DON'T YOU BE                    
TALKIN' ABOUT                   
NOBODY DYING.                   

JUST TAKE IT EASY.              

SO A LITTLE WAR                 
WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?            

    I AIN'T GOT NO LOVE         
        FOR ANYONE.             

    I'M A BUSINESSMAN.          

    IT'S ALL FAIR.              

            THEN WHY NOT HELP US
            BE MORE FAIR?       

I MIGHT BE INTERESTED           
FOR A PRICE.                    

        O.K., THEN.             
        HOW ABOUT SOME GUNS,    
        AMMUNITION, EXPLOSIVES, 

        THAT KIND OF THING?     

    A MAN WHO EARNS             
    WHAT YOU DO                 
    CAN AFFORD THE BEST.        

        I KNOW WHERE            
    TO GET YOU THE BEST.        

YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM.            

        YES, YOU CAN.           

        SURE, YOU CAN.          

HE'S GOING                      
TO SELL YOU OUT.                

        WAIT. NOW JUST          
        HEAR ME OUT.            

    I DID SOMETHING             
    I WISH I HADN'T HAVE.       

    I HEARD THAT COP SAYING     

    HE HAD A LICENSE NUMBER     
    HE GOT FROM YOUR FATHER.    

        I WAS THE ONE           
    WHO RATTED HIM TO SPYRO.    

            A MINUTE            
    AFTER I OPENED MY MOUTH,    

    I WISH I HADN'T HAVE.       

    I'M SORRY, MAN.             
    I WANT TO MAKE IT UP.       

            ALL RIGHT. CHILL.   

    STILL GONNA COST YOU,

            WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,
            I CAN AFFORD IT.    

    IT'LL TAKE A FEW HOURS      
    TO SET UP THIS BUY,         

    BUT I'M TALKING 12, 15 Gs,  

        NOW, CASH,              
        ALL IN HUNDREDS.        

    10% OF THAT STICKS TO ME.   

        MY COMMISSION.          

            ALL RIGHT,

            AN ENFORCEABLE ONE. 

    IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE.       

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

    THE CHEST AREA?             

        DON'T HIT

    HIT SOMETHING THAT BREAKS,  

        LIKE THE FACE           
        OR THE RIBS             

        OR THE KNEECAPS.

A VERY SPECIAL PRICE--          

ONLY $18,000.

        AND ALL,                

        UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. 

    YEAH.                       

YOU MISSED A LOT,               
NOT KNOWING KENNY.

FULL OF HIS OWN WAYS            
ABOUT THINGS.                   

BASKETBALL WAS HIS LIFE.        

HE WAS GOING TO BE              
A BIG STAR.                     

HE HAD A PLAN,                  
JUST LIKE YOU.                  

            I WAS GOING TO BE

AND I KNEW                      
YOU COULD DO IT.                

NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.            

        YOU NEVER LET ME KNOW.  

THAT'S WHY                      
I HAD TO LET YOU GO.

                COME ON, LAURIE.

I DIDN'T WANT TO GET            
IN THE WAY OF YOUR DREAMS.      

YOU WOULD'VE NEVER              
FORGIVEN ME FOR IT.             

IT WOULD'VE KILLED              
WHATEVER WE HAD.                

            THAT'S JUST LIKE ME,
            KILLING THINGS.     

I READ ABOUT THAT.              
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

        IT WAS NEVER THE SAME   
        AFTER THAT.

        FROM WHAT?              

        I WAS A FAILURE,

        I FAILED MYSELF,        
        I FAILED YOU.           

        I COULDN'T EVEN         
        FACE UP TO YOU.         

        ESPECIALLY...

        SENT ME AWAY.

HE LOVED YOU.                   

I MADE SURE OF THAT.

                HIS ASS HAD     
                $1,500 ON HIM.  

    THAT MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT.

        THAT'S WHAT             
    I'M TALKING ABOUT.          

THIS IS                         
VERY DISAPPOINTING.             

WE'VE SHOWN YOU                 
NOTHING BUT LOVE, DINK...

        LITTLE WORD MAN.        

    JOHN BOOKMAN THOUGHT        

    THAT HE COULD TAKE THIS TOWN
        BACK FROM US.           

        HE WAS WRONG.           

    JOHN BOOKMAN TRIED TO       
    CROSS US WITH THE DIABLOS.  

    HE WAS WRONG AGAIN.         

YEAH!                           
                        RIGHT!  

    NOW WE WILL BURN THIS WHOLE 
    FUCKIN' BLOCK TO THE GROUND.

            [SIRENS]            

THIS IS A REAL TRAGEDY          
HERE, REVEREND.                 

ALL THESE PEOPLE                
LOSING THEIR HOMES.             

            I SURE HOPE         
            THEY GOT INSURANCE.

            BROUGHT THIS DOWN.  

        AND THIS IS             
    JUST THE BEGINNING.         

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?      

            BOOKMAN BOUGHT SOME 
            AUTOMATIC WEAPONS,  

            HIT THE DIABLOS,    
            MADE IT LOOK LIKE   
            IT WAS US.          

    WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE       
    THESE WEAPONS ARE.          

I DON'T KNOW.                   
THEY MOVE THEM AROUND.          

        NEXT TIME THEY DO,      
        WE'RE GONNA BE THERE.   

        YOU SEE TO IT,          
        OR MORE PLAGUES

        HE WAS ONLY             
        14 YEARS OLD.           

THAT'S THEIR WAY                
OF DELIVERING                   
A MESSAGE TO US.

            HOME. MOVE!         

                GET UP!         

            DAMN SHAME IT HAD   
            TO COME TO THIS,    
            ISN'T IT?           

ALL RIGHT.                      

    SURE YOU'RE HAND'S O.K.?    

YEAH. IT'S COOL.                

DAMN. IT'S ABOUT TIME.          

BUBBA, YOU'RE LOOKING           
GOOD, MY MAN.                   

    NEVER FELT BETTER.          

            IT SURE FEELS GOOD, 
            ALL US REBELS       
            TOGETHER AGAIN,     

            BUT, DAMN,          
            WHO'S GOING FIRST?  

                    WE ALL ARE. 

WHAT?                           

                ALL RIGHT.      
                LET'S GO!       

ALL RIGHT.                      

        I'LL BE BACK!           

        I PROMISE YOU!          
        I'M NOT DONE YET!       

GET TO THE OLD                  
STEEL MILL, FAST!               

THE FACT                        
THAT JOHN BOOKMAN               

USED ALL THOSE                  
HEAVY WEAPONS ON US             

IS PROOF IN ITSELF              

THAT HE WAS THE ONE             
THAT RAIDED THE DIABLOS.        

        LET'S HOPE BLOOD AGREES.

HEY, KID, WHAT                  
ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?         

            NOBODY HAD ROOM     
            FOR ME IN THE CAR.  

                WHERE THE HELL  
                IS SPYRO        
                AND DAMIEN?     

                I DON'T KNOW.   

    THEY YELLED SOMETHING ABOUT 
    GOING TO THE OLD STEEL MILL.

JOHN, YOU REMEMBER              
THE SHORTCUT?                   

        YEAH. I SHOULD.         

        I WORKED THERE          
        FIVE YEARS.             

        HAVE THE COPS           
        MEET US AT THE MILL.    

I GUESS WE                      
BETTER MOP UP.                  

    YOU GOING TO BE             
    ALL RIGHT, LAURIE?          

                YEAH. I'M GOING 
                TO FIND MARCUS. 

    YOU GOT IT. LET'S GO.       

I'VE KNOWN BLOOD                
ALL OF HIS LIFE.                

THERE SHOULD HAVE               
NEVER BEEN TROUBLE              
BETWEEN US.                     

        THINGS AIN'T NEVER GOING
        TO BE LIKE THEY WERE.   

                WE GOT TO GET   
                TO BLOOD FIRST. 

SPEED UP!                       

THIS ISN'T THE SHORTCUT         
I WAS THINKING ABOUT.           

            NO. YOU DONE FORGOT.

OH, MAN!                        

                MARCUS, MARCUS! 

                I'LL GET YOU    
                SOME HELP.      

                DON'T MOVE.     

                I'LL GET YOU    
                SOME HELP.      

                    DON'T MOVE. 

JUST STAY THERE.                
JUST STAY THERE.                

                        AAH!

YOU MUST NOT HAVE TALKED        
TO YOUR FAMILY ABOUT ME YET.    

I OFFED                         
YOUR PUNK-ASS SON!              

DO I HAVE TO DO                 
YOUR BITCH ASS, TOO?            

                    YOU DID IT?

        THAT MOTHERFUCKER       

        AIN'T GOING TO          
        BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE?   

WELL, LET'S FIND OUT.           

WOMAN'S INTUITION.              

    HYAH!

        I DIDN'T KNOW HIM,      

        BUT, YOU SEE,           
        I'M YOUR SON.           

        YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM.  

        YOU CREATED ME. NOW     
        YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME?

            HUH? UHH!

                DAMIEN'S DEAD,  

                DOESN'T MEAN    
                YOU CAN MOVE IN.

                THAT FAR AWAY.
