(Bagpipes play)

(Dramatic, fast-paced music)

(Door slams)

(Breathes heavily)

(Footsteps approach)

What's wrong with you, girl?

I just came to say goodnight.

No, you didn't.

Well.

Well, well, well.

You know.

Don't you?

You know.

Your fucking bitch of mother,

Must've passed out drunk.

Every time I come over.

Well...

It's gotta go somewhere.

It's man's nature.

Man cannot change

His nature.


Fuck off.

Ain't no junkies that
deal through here.

What you want, Vine?

Status quo.

No dead little girls
in the basement,

No building crawling with cops.

Dead girl, what the
fuck you talking about?

Well I figure
when she stabs you

With that large nail
she has in her hand,

You'll do one of two things:

You'll either beat her so
bad she needs an ambulance,

Or kill her.

Either way it's just not
good for business, so...

You know.

You'll have to kill
her somewhere else.

You tripping, man.

Girl ran off.

I just came to get her.
That's it.

Andre.

Patron Saint of lost children.

(Quiet dramatic music
building in volume)

(Sirens wail in distance)
(men shout on street)

(woman screams)

(Alarm wails)

are signs everywhere.

A floating leaf,
a sound, a shadow.

It's not the sign, but the
meaning that concerns us.


Talk to Big Wayne.

Do you understand these
are signs of deception?


he's cheating on you.

(Maria sighs)

Infidelity is also a sign

We must seek further meaning.

He don't love me.

That's the meaning.

That's why he go
with that whore!

(Speaks foreign language)

(Spooky, spiritual whooshing)

Madam Cornelia?

What should I do?

Well, let's see what
the cards tell us, next.

(Glass cracks)
(dramatic music)

These old cards,
they rip so easily.

Cristo.


Esta negro.

It changed to black glass.

And you can see that?

understand, Madam Cornelia.

You will, Maria, briefly.

I'm sorry.

(Dramatic music)

(Maria gasps for breath)

(Knocks on door)

Dooley.

(Cell phone key pad clicks)

(Demonic whispers)


The new Interpreter arrives.


is not in the UK,

If in fact she is a she.

Right, who's got it?


But the card is not blue.


What do you mean, it's not blue?

It's always blue.

The most incomparable blue.

The most azure blue.


(Disembodied voices
speaks foreign languages)


[Voiceover] You can see...
[Voiceover] I see.

was this not foreseen?

What is the meaning?


(Voices fade)

What comes?

(Footsteps approach)

Interpreter.

Ah, now you're sure
she saw the card

Before you pierced her?

It's a small thing to kill
somebody over, you know?

None of us happens, Adam.

Ever.

Obsidian is a sign
that a new Interpreter

Has come to the world.

But it is always blue.

Humans do not see into our world

Without being touched.

Yeah, well...

You touched her.

I can help you with the body.

Not really sure
what else I can do.

Keep your eyes open.

Something has come
into our plane.

If it is not Fortune
seeking a new Interpreter,

It may be something else.

Look for anything unusual.

(Vine sighs)

"Unusual."



Hit me again, Frank.

I'm telling you,

Fucking put it down.

(Pan thwacks)
(Frank grunts)

(Body falls)

evening, America.

Welcome to the show.

(Voice drowned out
by tense music)

(Audience laughs on television)

(Audience applauds
on television)

(Water drips)

Vine.

What the fuck you doing?

Eavesdropping.

You got my money?

Tripp and Helo just
went to the bank.

Yeah, you don't have a bank.

Sure we do.

Snatch and Grab Trust.

See?

Here they come.

Have a little faith, Vine.


Tripp.

Madam.

Fuck you, you
fucking procurer.

Do your job and bring
us something to eat.

Helo!

I speak for us.

I do.

He's hungry.

Yeah, well they
were beating the shit

Out of each other next
door a minute ago.

Have 'em take a
snort of that, huh?

You know how it is, Vine.

Same thing day in, day
out, it gets tedious.

But that's why we like
your product so much.

Variety is the spice of life.

So they say.

Pay me tomorrow, no later.

You let him get
away with too much.

You don't tear off the
hand that feeds you, Helo.

The minute he stops feeding us,

I'll rip his heart out.

[Man on street] Fuck you!

Come here, bitch.

I said come here, motherfucker!

(Siren wails in distance)


(Dramatic music)

Got any ice?

(Man yells)

I'll kill myself!

I swear to Christ.

Please!
(glass shatters)

(Flesh squishes)

(Dramatic music intensifies)

(Music plays from
within apartment)

Oh, my God.

Beautiful.

You're fricking beautiful.

(Amber moans)
(man grunts)

(Dramatic music)

Oh, shit.

I didn't realize
how strong this was.

Hey, uh, what happened?


We'll just call
this one a freebie.

I just started my period.

Oh, shit, really?

(Electronic tones)

(Electronic tones)

(Creature screams)

(Voice drones on
television in background)

(Sara breathes quietly)

That's unusual.


What are you doing down here?

I'm running away.

Ah.

I hate to break it to you, kid,

But the basement
ain't exactly "away."

I came to get Penny.

I dropped her, before.

Look, kid.

I wouldn't run away.

There's bad things out there.

There's bad things here.

Oh, yeah?

Should I take that personally?

You deal drugs.

And you scare people.

You have a gun.

Yeah.

And you don't care about

Somebody who needs help.

You're worse than Andre.

Hm, pretty tough, huh?

No fear.

(Dramatic music)
I can make you afraid.

Just trying to prove a point.

Relax.

I saved your ass, before.

You should be thanking me.

You told him to kill me.

Yeah, well, he didn't, did he?

He will.

I can't stop him.

But you could.

You have a gun.

No thanks.

Why not?

Why won't you help me?

Status quo, kid.

What's that?

Hunger.

Everybody's hungry
for something.

You know, they can't control it,

And they can't ignore it.

Sometimes you're the mouth

And sometimes you're the meal.

It's just the way it is.

Sara!

What the hell's this, huh?

Nothing, lady.

I was just looking for Dooley.

Where do you think
you're going, huh?

Where you going?

This place ain't
good enough for you?

Is that it, baby? Huh?

You gonna go out and
find a little house,

With a Mommy and Daddy,

And a little puppy?

Hm?
(hand slaps)

Didn't happen for me, it's
not happening for you.

Pick it up!

Come on, let's go.


I hate you!

Kids, right?

They're the worst.

Go!

God damn humans.

(Door bangs)

Dooley.

(Wings flap)

(Suspenseful music)

(Door bangs)

(Sara screams)

(Doorknob rattles)

(Sara cries)

No use fighting this, girl.

(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

(Vine grunts and
breathes heavily)

(Sara laughs)

You got your books,
got your homework.

You got your lunch money.

Good. Good girl.

So what other things you got?

Only things you really need.

What's in here,
and what's in here.

Now give me some.

(Both laugh)

See you when you get home.

(Wayne laughs)
Hey.

Hey, Andre.

Looking sharp.

good to see you.

Looking for work today,

Thought I'd dress up a little.

Good luck, man.

I'll let you know if
I hear of anything.

Hey, thank you, man.

Much appreciate it.

Good morning, Mister Vine.

Sorry about last night,

I was uh, sick.

But I'm better now.

Hopefully you can forgive me.

Um...

Sure.

Thank you.

I gotta get going.

Have a good day, Mister Vine.

Goodbye.

(Lisa yells)

(Lisa murmurs and laughs)

Sorry.

Oh, shit, dude!

I'm sorry.

You don't smell sorry.

Yeah, um...

Okay.
(both laugh)

I'm Frank.

Vine.

Vine.

Cool name, dude.

This is Lisa.


What happened?

Oh, uh...

I hit myself with a bottle.

I...

I was massively inebriated and,

I think I just wanted
her to open the door.

I locked myself
in the bedroom.

I was messed up.

Like...

Bad, but it wasn't the booze.

I wasn't well.

But you're better, now.

Yes.

(Lisa laughs)
Yes I am.

We both are.

You just woke up and
everything was better?

I can't explain it, I...

I just feel totally different.

You know, not physically...

I mean, my head hurts
like a motherfucker.

But...

This is gonna sound kinda dumb,

But psychologically.

Spiritually.

I just feel really, really good.

You feel it too,
don't you, Vine?

Well, we'd better go.

We're visiting my mom.

It's been like, a year.

Take care, bro.

Bye.

(Steady, mysterious music)

(Door creaks open)

What the hell's
going on, Vine?

It's the entire building.

Every floor.

The humans have changed.

Something has
come into our plane.


Helo!

Sorry, Interpreter.

He doesn't know
his place, lately.

What do you see?

Disease has come,

From another plane.

Another world,
infecting the humans.

Well, what do we do?

You must stay in your rooms,

While the Interpretee
look for a cure.

No one leaves.

So, you wanna tell me what's

Really going on, Cornelia?

Because this ain't a disease

I've ever heard of.

This is a powerful
method of Divination.

Yeah.

I'm uh, I'm familiar
with oracle bones.

I've never seen one
with a human bone.

Is that the real
reason you killed her?

The sign is a circle
that doesn't close.

See?

And here, converging
lines that do not meet.

Shapes that are almost shapes,

Symbols that are almost symbols.

Disease has come across.

Yeah.

Well show me a disease

That can rip a man in half.

(Wings flap)

I'm talking about the humans.

Not a bunch of fucking drales!

Are you feeding,
is what I'm asking?


[Television announcer] A
small town is in shock, today.

The deaths of two
newborn babies...


[Television announcer]
At Saint Joseph's Hospital,

Have been ruled homicides,

[Television announcer]
by investigators.

The families have
asked for privacy

As they mourn the
loss of the infants.

There's plenty of
misery out there.

Let's go get some.

Feed in the wild?

It's too dangerous.

You never know whose
territory you're in,

And when you find
out, it's too late.

I won't let you
starve, brother.

I found blood at the
bottom of the stairs,

But it wasn't Dooley's.

It was weird.

Not quite human, but
not demon, either.

I'm thinking maybe he
got one good shot in

Before he was killed.

If you were asking for
something unusual, that's it.

Show me.


Gone?

Yeah, well.

I kinda got knocked out,

And when I came to...

Wait a minute, there's
something in there.

Does this have any meaning?

Everything has meaning.

Not everything means
something that matters.

You're more than welcome
to chase bird feathers

And disappearing blood, Adam,

But I've got work to do.

What are you gonna do?

Find a cure for the humans.

(Laughs softly)

That's funny.

Because every human I talked to

Said they already found one.

(Low, mysterious music)

(Liquid boils)

Luck.

More luck.

(Knocking at door)

Hey, Ford.

What is it, Vine?

Did the humans change back?

No, no, I don't think so.

I have a question.

You know a thing or two
about demon science, right?


Is it true?

Can you conjure a demon
if you know its true name?

what signifies the demon,

Not just the name.

Unlikely to find one,

Nearly impossible to find both.

Why?

It's a demon.

A powerful one.

He's influencing
the humans, Ford.

Oh, my God.

all you need to know,

Now get the hell outta here,

Before you bring me more bad
luck than you already have.

(Footsteps approach)

I'm building a bookcase,

Just getting a little
construction advice.

The Interpretee
need your help.

You need to leave the building.

get Ford or Amber?

They're hungrier than I am.

We're worried
about what happens

If you don't find anything.

Not if you do.

Your lack of hunger
and your lack of fear

Make you the obvious choice.

You're the strongest
of us, Adam.

Just go around the block.

Shouldn't take long.

I'll make a debt.

I've had enough of those
outstanding, already.

Cost you more to keep track
of then they're worth.

(Traffic whooshes)

(fist thunks)

(Electronic music)

(Electronic music with a beat)

Is this gonna hurt much?

Man, you gotta watch this.

With any luck.

I hear people
freak the fuck out.

Sheer terror.

Next time just ask
me to get in the car.

I'll say yes.

My apologies, Mister Vine,

But my instructions from
Mister Granville were...

Explicit.

Yeah, and what exactly
were your instructions?

Well he told me to
make you hit the canvas,

Which means, "to render
unconscious, or knock out"

In the parlance.

Yeah, I got it.

This way.

(Demon growls)

Ghoul, huh?

Moving up in the world, Tarqus.

Success has its perks.

Yeah, so...

To what do I owe the honor

Of getting my head knocked in?

We've been getting calls

About the situation
in your building.

There's no situation
in my building.

You've been misinformed.

People without
shame, fear, or misery.

We need to know if this is true.

"We"?

Now what would the Clades care

About a run-down tenement

Full of alcoholics
and wife-beaters?

The Clades are a
trade organization.

The Clades are
our way of life.

Every demon benefits from

Representation in
the market place.

Even a freelance misery
peddler like yourself.

Ah.

But not the Interpretee.

I mean, an Interpreter pretty
much renounces his kind,

When he assumes the role.

Offid, Rilk, Vorling,

Even a Moloch like you.

The Interpretee
have no allegiance

To anyone but themselves.

And that's a problem, isn't it?

Are you asking if what happened
in my building is true?

Or if some plan you put
in motion actually worked?

So...

Something is happening.

What is this, Vine?

A new drug?

Doesn't look like it.

We have to have
a long, long talk

About all the things
you're not telling me.

(Raucous laughter)

(Dramatic music)

Stop it! Stop it!

They'll shut u s down.

What do the Clades
have to do with this?


I know you wanna take down
the Interpretee, Tarqus.

Too many demons
believe in them, now.

Yes, but does this look
like a master plan, to you?

(Demons growl)
(humans yell)

You...

She sent you.

Everything was fine
till you showed up.

(Tarqus grunts)

(Vine yells)

(Wings flap)

Hey, wait.

I'm Vine.

Pleased to meet you, I'm Ron.

How uh, how you
doing today, Ron?

Fine.

Yeah? I mean, uh,

How are you doing
today as opposed to...

I don't know, say,
say yesterday.

Um, about the same.

Got here 4:30am, I uh...

Came down, opened up the doors,

Worked the morning rush.

Cleaned the grill, prepped
for the lunch rush.

Same as yesterday.

Fascinating, huh?

Oh...

I don't feel like killing
every living thing

On the face of the
earth anymore, though.

Felt that way this morning,

Yesterday morning.

About every day before that.

But not now.

What came over you?

I don't know.

Suddenly just uh, had a thought.

Maybe all these people
are just like me?

They've hit a bit of trouble,

Or things didn't work out the
way they'd hoped they would.

They're confused, they're angry.

But really they're,
they're afraid.

When did this thought kick in?

Just a little bit ago.

'Bout the same time you came in,

Come to think of it.

Hey, you want a slice of pie?

On the house.

No, no.

I'm getting you one, anyway.

Nothing changed.

Nothing changed
until I showed up.

And not just at Tarqus',

But at the diner, too, on
the other side of town.

You shouldn't have gone there.

There's a game, and I
don't know what it is.

But somebody's moving
the pieces around,

And I don't know who
the fuck they are.

And all I know is I'm
one of the pieces.

And I don't like it.

Not one fucking bit, Cornelia.

Calm down, Adam.

Why not go to the diner?

You told me to find
some misery, right?

I could've gone anywhere.

Unless you knew I
wouldn't make it

Three steps outside the door.

You called Tarqus.

We can see nothing, now.

You have no concept
of what it's like

To be blind in this way.

Are the Clades working
with the Interpretee?

No.

We needed information,
that's all.

So you sent me to find
out if I would infect them!

And a kiss just in case I
didn't make it back, huh?

Well I am really
flattered, honey.

You must really like me.

I do like you, Adam.

I've made that very clear.

I don't give a damn.

I won't be a dupe for
you or anybody else.

I'm sorry.

We needed to know,
and now we do.

What do you know?

not come to the humans.

It's come to us.

I know what that is.

That's Darvatian,
get away from it.

(Ford yells)

There's a protection on it!

A protection.

We're trapped.

(Cornelia screams
in very high pitch)

Silence!

We're all contagious.

We will not be allowed to
leave until this is resolved,

Or we are dead.

She sent me to a ghoul club.

After I arrived, they changed.

Stopped suffering.

When the demons couldn't
feed, they slaughtered them.

So what?

Humans are terminal from birth.

What about us?

So far, the plan is
we starve to death.

Each of you must pay a visit
to a human in the building.

Find some shred of misery,
suffering, anything.

No matter how content
they may seem,

They have a weakness.

Find it.

(Smooth jazz music
plays on radio)

(Knocking at door)

Hi, I'm Amber.

I uh, live down the hall.

Uh, my name's Ford.

Of course you are.


Come on in.

I made cookies.

Cookies!

I fucking told
you, I told you!

Calm down.

"One more day, let's
wait one more day."

Now look where we are!

Calm. Down.

We have to think
this thing through.

We can't let the
hunger get to us.

If that happens,
we're fucking done.

You understand?

Should we test the humans,
like the Interpreter said?

Fuck what the
Interpreter said.

That will only make us weaker.

We stay.

We think.

We figure it out.

Figure what out?

How to break the protection.

(Keys clank)

[Ford Voiceover] You've gotta
draw a seven-legged scarab.

Then you'll need mercury.

Sulfur, and salt.

Put them on the body of
the scarab close together,

But don't let them touch.

They'll be picking you off
the ceiling if that happens.

Place the feather on top,

So that it touches all three.

Then light it on fire as you
speak the demon's true name.

(Vine whispers)
(flame hisses)

Peronga Ola Vakayah.

(Ingredients explode)

Shit.

(Smooth jazz plays on radio)

I used to hate this place,

But all it needs is really
just a little sprucing up.

Sprucing up?

You gave this place
a full makeover.

She has real talent.

She's signing up for
school in the fall.

So, what do you do, Amber?

("Like You" by Andrew
Kapner and Landon Newsom)

(Female singer vocalizes)

* Frustration

* I'm in a place of no escape

* Dive in your
hate, can't liberate

* Don't wanna live,
going on this way

* I don't wanna be
just another fake

* Can't stand the
ways you manipulate

* Just to be safe I isolate

* Don't tell me this is a fey

* When I turn around
it'll dissipate

* You can stay a princess

* But I won't be your witness

Amber?

(Amber sighs)

* Aggression

* Excuses

(Vocalist continues
singing in low, even voice)

(Chair bangs on floor)

Ugh, what's wrong
with you people?

You don't need to
show us any more, Amber.

I think we understand.

Don't we, Frank?

Sure, it's like,

Prostitution or performance
art, or something.

I'll make my own damn luck.

(Electronic tones)
(Ford laughs)

Finally!

(Dramatic music)

What do you want?

I said, what the
hell do you want?

This is my luck, clear out!

Ah!

(Demon yells)
(glass breaks)

You're starving.

It fucks with you.

Don't let it, you'll
get used to it.

After a while it feels normal.

(Amber hisses)

(Vine growls)

Make love to me, Vine.

Okay.

(Fast-paced, dramatic music)
(demon growling)

Do you trust the Interpreter?

Not entirely.

But I don't trust
anyone, entirely.

You know...

I knew an Interpreter
once, a long time ago.

They can't be killed.

Everything on this earth
can be killed, Amber.

No, they have to
kill themselves.

Fortune belongs to them.

We're all gonna starve, and
she'll find her way out.

She won't even mean
to, but she will.

I need you to find
me a way out, Vine.

(Door rattles)

[Vine] It won't open.
[Amber] Break it in.

(Ford groans)


What happened, Ford?

What happened?


So dark.

What?

He's starving to death.

What?

Why is this so soon?

Just die, you stupid Vorlich!

Look at me.


Stay with me.

Hey, Ford.


(Amber hisses)

What's wrong with you, Vine?

You know he's never gonna pay.

Come on!

Act like a demon.

Take what you want.

You did with the Sephling.

That ugly whore.

I know you crave me, Adam.

I can smell it on you.

I smell your lust,
your violence.

Do it.

Why do you hesitate?

Do it!

Tear me limb from limb.

How can I?

You can't be killed,
unless you kill yourself.

What of our long kisses?

What are you and your
friends up to, huh?

Some experiment
with the balance?

You wanna know if we'll start

Killing humans when
we're starving?

The answer's yes.

I've already seen it.


We cure ourselves, or we die.

All of us!

There is no cure, because
there is no disease.

A demon is behind
this, Cornelia.

And I'm going to prove it.

Veralka Veedan Tadas.

(Ingredients explode)

(Glass shatters)

(Low, suspenseful music)


evening, good to see you.

How's it going?

(Knocks on door)

Oh, hi.

We're just about, um...

Come on in.

You know...

My father used to say,

"Andre, folks'll tell
you, clothes make the man."

"But don't listen to 'em."

"The man makes himself."

"And cloth doesn't come cheap."

I just remembered
that the other day.

(Jane laughs)

My dad said TV
rots your brain.

said that, too.

(Andre and Jane laugh)

I like TV.


Gotta have balance, is all.

Wake up!

We are awake, silly.

We can see you're
upset, Mister Vine.

Is there anything we can do?

Don't you find it the
least bit disturbing

What happened in the
basement last week?

Oh, I was sick.

You understand, right pumpkin?

Of course.

And you just magically,

Magically got better, hm?

Oh, no, not
magic, Mister Vine.

Miracle.

By God, himself.

God.

And what did he look like?

I didn't see him, but
well, who else could it be?

asking, Mister Vine?

Andre was going
to forcibly rape

Your 11 year old daughter, Sara.

Now surely on some level,

As a mother, you are
deeply and fundamentally

Horrified by this, aren't you?

I was a terrible mother.

Neglectful, abusive.

And thinking about it now,

I might "feel a deep,
fundamental horror," as you say.

Maybe I would feel shame,
or guilt, or sorrow.

But my question to you is this,

What purpose would that serve?

Would it change what happened?

Would it protect
Sara in the future?

Would it show Andre
and I how wrong it was?

Horror, fear, regret, shame...

Maybe once long ago,
they were necessary.

When we lived in
caves like animals.

We don't need those
feelings anymore.

We've evolved.

We've had knowledge
and reason for

Thousands of years,
it's time we used them.

It's time we became truly human.

I got a second job
interview tomorrow.

That fellow Wayne?

Put in a good word.

That's great.

Isn't that great?

Yeah.

Yeah.

(Demons breathe shallowly)

(Mace yells)

You said you would
rip his heart out

The moment he
stopped feeding us!

fault, for Christ's sake.

You said you
wouldn't let us starve!

We haven't yet, have we?

I don't see you with any ideas.

It's been a week.

The humans aren't
gonna change back.

So we gotta change them back.

The balance.

Fuck Vine, fuck the balance!

And this one I call Penny.

She's Native American.

(Both laugh)

Where's your family?

I don't have a family.

Do you have friends?

I have a type.

I'm a Taryn.

It's hard to explain.

Explain it to me.

I'm a pretty good listener.

My teacher says so.

Why not?

I had a dream.

We don't dream, but I had one.

And I'm wondering if
it's still happening.

Then it doesn't
matter, does it?

Anything you do in
a dream isn't real.

(Orchestral music)

You're a bird man.

It's not bad.

I mean, it's cool.

Really.

Don't be sad.

Can you fly?

Yes.


No, people can't unless
they've been pierced.

It has something to do
with the body, somehow.

Or the weight of the world
doesn't let them see us.

When we fly, they see a bird,

Or something else that
makes sense to them.

If it doesn't make sense, they
don't see anything at all.

I think I understand.

Maybe it'll all work
differently one day.

It'll all make
sense to everybody.

And everybody will
see everybody else

The way they really are.

(Vine laughs very quietly)

Did she come with this?

No, I put it there.

Where did you get it?

From a bird.

You saw it?

In the basement.

The same night I saw you.

The night I was
going to run away.

A little red bird.

Hang on.

Did it look like this?

No, not exactly.

How about that?

Almost, but the
wings weren't black,

It was all red.

That's it!

What does it mean?

It's the status quo, kid.

(Men grunting)

What is it?

Stay here.

(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

(Demons yell)
(fists punch)

What's wrong?

Hunger.

It's made them crazy.

I speak for us!

Not any more.

Mace!

(Flesh smacks repeatedly)

(Neck cracks)


Does he?

(Flesh rips)

I speak for us.

I speak for us.

I speak for us!

It's like this with our kind.

(fist smacks)

Okay, Perembra.

Rubra.

(Wings flap)

(Wings flap)
(dramatic, eerie music)

Show yourself!

(Demon growls)

Please.

Please!

Show yourself!

(Demonic whispers)
(angelic music)

Wait...

(Power whines)

Wait, no!

Stop!

(High-pitched whine
grows very loud)

Stop!


(Breathes shakily)

(Door creaks)

I saw him.

He was right here.

It's not a disease, Cornelia.

I know.

This card represents you.

The physician
represents disease.

Illness, death.

Also healing, and cure.

But above all, it
represents compassion.

You have done what no
demon has done before.

You have changed your
fundamental nature.

You care for them.

You have compassion
for the humans.

It is you that brought
this into our world!

(Vine growls)
(Cornelia hisses)

Not me.

Deny that you care for them.

Do it.

Lie to my face!

Nature abhors a vacuum, Adam.

Your compassion is a bright
hole, in your black heart.

And nature has
filled it with death,

For you and everyone around you.

You must repair your
heart, yourself.

You must kill the girl.

Hey...

Ford.

I need you to look at something.

(Ford breathes heavily)


I said it was a debt.

It's time to pay.

This was lead, when I
shot it into a demon.

A demon made of darkness.

Okay?

What is it now?

Aurum.

It's gold.

What kind of
demon can do that?

Any kind of demon.

Any kind of demon could do that.

(Ford laughs)

You impotent fool.

You false prophet.

You're gonna die, Vine.

Just like me.

We're immortal.

We're all going to...

I've been looking
for you everywhere.

Why are you hiding?

I'm not hiding.

I'm thinking.

There's a difference.

What are you thinking about?

A dream I had.

But you can't dream.

Only humans can dream.

I did.

Are you going to kill her?

Are you going to kill the girl?

Sure.

You're lying!

You're gonna choose her,

Over your own kind!

Is it because you think
that she's beautiful?

And that we're monsters.

We are monsters, Amber.

(Dramatic music)

(Vine grunts)
(Amber yells)

(Vine growls)

(Amber yells)

I don't wanna kill you.

Please...

(Vine yells)

(Cheerful music)
Oh, man!

Whoo!

To your new job.

Oh, no, baby...

To us.

Oh yeah.

Hey, everybody,
thanks for coming.

(Group cheers)

(Cheerful music is muffled
playing through wall)

Found you a way out.

("Surf's Up" by The Surfonics)

(Knocks on door)

(Door creaks open)

(Gun clicks)

Hello, Vine.

Look, Penny lost
one of her eyes.

You're gonna kill me, Vine.

I don't want you to.

But if you have
to, I understand.

You do?

Status quo.

It's about killing.

You have to kill
things to stay alive.

That's what you meant, isn't it?

(Dramatic music)

(Shocking music)
(Cornelia cries out)

sign was corrupt.

But Fortune found him anyway.

He dreamed.

Vine is the Interpreter.

He will kill us all.

I will have my share.

You okay?

All right, I want you to
stay outta the building

Until you see the cops.

A lot of...
(mysterious, low squeal)

Come on, let's go.

where are we going?

you some place safe.

Yeah, over here.


(Knocks on door)

(Door squeaks open)


No matter what you hear,

You don't come out till I
come back for you, okay?


I'm not afraid.


Wait a second.

(Door squeaks open)
This isn't right.

(Door slams)

I can see you again.

(Dramatic orchestral music)

Where are we?

I don't feel right.

I feel...

(Eerie voice whispers)

[Sara] I'm scared, Vine.
[Vine] Shh.


Kill her...



Kill her...

Vine...


(Suspenseful music)

(Shocking music)

There's nowhere to go, Vine.

(Vine yells)


Vine!

(Vine growls)

(Fist smacks)

(Bone crunches)


(Multiple gunshots)

(Vine breathes heavily)

(Chains rattle)

Safe here.

That's enough.

Just a little more.

I'm so hungry.

So...

Hungry!

No, no, no, no!


(Vine growls)

(Fists smack)

Vine!

(Helo yells)

(Fists smack)

(Neck crunches)

(Blood drips)
(Vine breathes heavily)

Kill her, Interpreter!

The sign was corrupt,
but it was correct.

Fortune found you.

You dreamed.

You have been chosen to
join the Interpretee.

Fortune has a test
for each of us.

This is yours.

Kill the girl, end this famine,

And begin your training.

(Vine yells)

No!

(Vine grunts)

We are the disease.

We don't belong here, Cornelia.

Of course we belong here!

We see everything.

We know everything,
we live forever.

We are perfect!

We're freaks!

Freaks!

We have wings, and
claws, and horns.

Like animals.

And even then, no one sees us.

She...

Is beautiful.

She's perfect.

The world belongs to her.

Maybe there's some
world we belong.

But not this one.

There is no other world, Adam.

There's no where
else for us to go.

As above, so below.

As below, so above.

(Speaks foreign language)

No, no, no, no!

(Cornelia gasps)

(Heart beats)

(Cornelia yells)

Vine!

What did you
dream, Interpreter?

That I saved her.

(Bone crunches)
(Cornelia gaps)

Sara?

Sara!

(Zipper rasps)

(Low, orchestral music)

(Vine sobs)

Oh, my God.

(Vine sobs)
Oh, my God.

(Wings flap)

Where are you?

Answer me!

Hello, Vine.

No.

Why would you do this?

Because I had to be sure.

I looked for you.

I rode on the back of Fortune,

Through many worlds.

And there you were.

Obedient. Resigned.

About to become an Interpreter.

Do you remember the dream?

That I saved her.

A demon with a conscience.

Who knew?

And you killed her.

Not me.

Andre kills her.

"Kills"?

Kills, kill, killed.

Will have killed, will kill.

It's all the same to me.

She's running away.

She thinks he's
asleep, but he's not.

(Belt jingles)

It was her blood.

(Belt jingles)

But it wasn't human.

Of course not.

She's not a human,
she's a child.

She's innocent.

Do you want me to tell
you what he does to her
before he kills her?

No.

You're something else, demon.

I will have to adjust, as
I have always adjusted.

Doing something
she shouldn't have,

Before it brought luck that
would've worked against me.

It won't make a
difference in the end.

My plan's already in motion.

No, don't.

Please.

Please, don't.

Don't destroy them.

They are flawed.

I know, but they are
perfectly flawed!

It's us who don't belong.

None of you belong.

It's okay, Vine.

The experiment's over.

You're free to go.

No.

Bring her back.

Bring her back!

Bring them all back!

You can.

I know you can.

I know your true name.

Is that right?

Tell me.

You are the one thing.

Ray...

Enough!

They must be whole.

It has stripped the
body, as you said.

So...

What do I call you?

(Demonic whispers)


Shoulda ran while you
had the chance, girl.

That doll ain't gonna save you.

Ain't nothing
gonna save us, now.

(Belt jingles)

(Fists smack)
(Andre grunts repeatedly)

Let me go, let me go!


Sara, Sara, wait.

It's really good to see you.

Shh, look, it's okay.

Sara, everything's gonna
be okay from now on.

I promise.

You told him to kill me.

And that was a mistake.

Okay, a really big mistake.

I won't make it again.

You promise?

I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

You're safe.

Okay?

Now go on back up.

Tell your mom Andre
won't be back for awhile.

He's got a few
things to work out.

Thank you.

(Belt jingles)

Hey Vine...

I just woke up in
the goddamn basement.

What the hell is going on?

[Television announcer]
Officers have released the name

Of the gang member
who brutally murdered

Four tenants in his building.

The 24 year old going
by the name Helo

Was identified as Jason Miller.

His victims are said to be two
of his fellow gang members,

An elderly resident,
Cornelia Coranza,

And the building's
manager, Patrick Dooley.

In other news, a city-wide

The police have

Wood Lake, is
that close to here?

No, no, nothing
like that's close.

Not to you.

(Knocking at door)

Hi.

Thanks for taking
care of her, Vine.

I wish you'd let me pay you.

Nah, when you get settled.

How was the meeting?

Um, it was good.

It's tough but good.

I hear Andre left town.

Yeah?

I don't know, maybe
I should've given
him a second chance.

Well, maybe.

But you only get so many
chances in this world.

Hey kiddo.

Come on, let's get dinner.


going out for a while.


Just over to Wood Lake.

I'm gonna check something out.

(Hands smack)

Thank you.

signs everywhere.

A floating leaf, a sound...

A shadow.

It's not the meaning, but
the sign that concerns us.

(Dramatic orchestral music)

Understand?
