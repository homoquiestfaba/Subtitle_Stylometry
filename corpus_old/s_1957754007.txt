<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

<i>I'll dry the tears</i>
<i>from your eyes</i>

<i>Let's don't let</i>
<i>a good thing die</i>

<i>Snowman's coming</i>

<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

<i>He'll take you by the hand</i>

<i>He'll say one, two, three</i>

<i>And you will be...</i>

<i>In cotton candy land</i>

<i>For those of you</i>
<i>who are wondering,</i>

<i>who this fella here is,</i>

<i>I am the legendary</i>
<i>Colonel Tom Parker.</i>

<i>Colonel Tom Parker,</i>
<i>legendary manager</i>

<i>of Elvis Presley, has been</i>
<i>rushed to Valley Hospital.</i>

<i>I am the man who</i>
<i>gave the world Elvis Presley.</i>

<i>Without me, there would be</i>
<i>no Elvis Presley.</i>

<i>And yet, there are some</i>

<i>who'd make me out</i>
<i>to be the villain</i>

<i>of this here story.</i>

<i>Colonel Tom Parker</i>
<i>was a liar, a cheat, a con man.</i>

<i>A shocking new book</i>
<i>accuses Colonel Tom Parker</i>

<i>of massive fraud</i>
<i>and mis-management.</i>

Parker received as much
as 50% of Elvis' income.

<i>He worked Elvis like a mule,</i>

<i>to support his own</i>
<i>gambling addiction.</i>

<i>The court finds</i>
<i>that the compensation received</i>

<i>by Colonel Parker</i>
<i>was excessive,</i>

<i>and shocked the conscience</i>
<i>of the court.</i>

<i>Many believe</i>
<i>that Colonel Tom Parker</i>

<i>was responsible for the death</i>
<i>of Elvis Presley.</i>

Now, you listen to me.

The only thing that matters
is that that man

gets up on that stage tonight.

<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

<i>His truth is marching on</i>

<i>His truth is marching on</i>

<i>Tom Parker killed him!</i>

No! That's not true.

No, no, I didn't kill him.

I made Elvis Presley.

<i>Nothing all those muckrakers</i>
<i>said in their books was true.</i>

Me and Elvis, we was partners.

It was Elvis the Showman
and the Colonel the Snowman.

<i>This is the lying Dutchman.</i>

<i>I always knew I was</i>
<i>destined for greatness.</i>

<i>As an orphan,</i>
<i>I ran away to the carnival,</i>

<i>where I learned the art</i>
<i>of the "snow job,"</i>

<i>of emptying a rube's wallet</i>
<i>while leaving them with nothing</i>

<i>but a smile on their face.</i>

<i>But a carnival act</i>
<i>that would get you</i>

<i>the most money, the most snow,</i>

<i>had great costumes</i>
<i>and a unique trick,</i>

<i>that gave the audience feelings</i>

<i>they weren't sure</i>
<i>they should enjoy.</i>

<i>But they do.</i>

<i>And I knew if I could</i>
<i>find such an act,</i>

<i>I could create the greatest...</i>

<i>show...</i>

<i>on...</i>

<i>earth.</i>

<i>After the carnival, I moved</i>
<i>into the music business...</i>

<i>the country music business.</i>

<i>I partnered with one of its</i>
<i>biggest stars, Hank Snow.</i>

<i>Pardon me</i>
<i>if I'm sentimental</i>

<i>When we say goodbye</i>

<i>And his hapless son,</i>
<i>Jimmie Rodgers Snow.</i>

Hot-diggity-dog, Billy.

-I got one.
-Oh, yeah.

Can't believe it.
Blow their socks off.

Security. Security, Diskin!

Tell the mayors of these towns
that we need a police escort

for Hank when he arrives.

In Baton Rouge, we are going
to have a carny wedding

at the top of the Ferris Wheel,

so, Zina, pick out
your next husband.

In New Orleans, we're gonna
use the loudspeaker

to announce you, Hank.
Oh, sure.

...you are going to march
in the parade.

Am I gonna be riding
on an elephant, too?

A man on an elephant
looks important.

And taller.

We still need to get
a novelty act

-to bring in the young folk.
-Well, yes, yes,

that's why you have
a meeting with
the Duke of Paducah tonight.

If we can book "the Funniest
Mouth in the South,"

we'll have the greatest show
of the season.

Hey, Jimmie,
turn that record off.

Y'all have to hear this.

Kids all over town
are playing it everywhere I go.

I hear Negro rhythms.

But with a country flavor.

Sun Records?
That's Sam Phillips' label.

Oh, yeah, Phillips.

He makes all those race records
with the colored singers.

Well, this fella's
on the Hayride tonight,

after me in the newcomer spot.

In Shreveport?

No, they are not putting
a colored boy on the Hayride.

That's the thing. He's white.

He's...

He's white?

<i>What do you think,</i>
<i>Texarkana?</i>

<i>Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

<i>Well, that's all right,</i>
<i>mama</i>

<i>That's all right for you</i>

<i>Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

<i>Everybody's talkin' 'bout</i>
<i>this new Presley kid</i>

<i>That's all right...</i>

<i>That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right...</i>

He's white?

<i>But it don't matter</i>
<i>if you do ten stupid things,</i>

<i>as long as you do</i>
<i>one smart one.</i>

<i>Welcome y'all</i>
<i>to the Louisiana Hayride,</i>

<i>broadcasting live</i>
<i>to 26 of these United States.</i>

<i>How do you think I feel</i>

<i>I know your love's not real</i>

Well, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

Where is the Colonel?

You have the fella that's
singing the "All Right, Mama,"

that new record that's
on the Sun label, eh?

-The pop jocks
keep playing him.
-Yeah.

Country DJs, too.

Even the colored kids,
they're buyin' his record.

The colored ki-- Well, where
would I find such an act?

The dressing room.

Oh. Howdy.
Hey, Elvis Presley?

-Blue Moon Boys?
-Yeah.

-You're up next.
-Oh, sh--

Excuse me. Bill, go time!

I know, I know.

Hi!
How's his stomach?

I thought I'd grab him a Pepsi,

but poor thing's still shaking
like a leaf.

I'll get him on the stage.
Come on. Let's go.

Here.

It'll settle your stomach.

What if I forget
the words on live radio?

All we gotta do out there's
just a bit of clownin' around.

That's how we got this thing
started in the first place.

Scotty and Bill are right,
Elvis.

You're not out there
on your own.

You boys are a band.
That's right.

The Lord gave us music
to bring people together.

We're like a family,

and family is the most
important thing of all.

Amen.

Come on now, Booby.
Jesse's shining bright tonight.

Shining down his strength
upon you.

<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>

<i>Jesse, Elvis's twin</i>
<i>brother, who died at birth.</i>

<i>Tragic.</i>

<i>Vernon, come quick!</i>
<i>It's another child!</i>

<i>My darling,</i>
<i>you'll have</i>
<i>the strength of two men.</i>

<i>But when</i>
<i>my boy's daddy</i>
<i>passed a bad check</i>

<i>and got carted off</i>
<i>to prison...</i>

<i>...the boy and his mama had</i>
<i>to take one of the houses</i>

<i>for white folks</i>
<i>in a colored neighborhood.</i>

<i>New boy! Come over!</i>

<i>But that boy</i>
<i>had a big imagination.</i>

<i>He really believed</i>
<i>he was the hero</i>

<i>in one of them comic books.</i>

<i>He was going to bust</i>
<i>his daddy out of the hoosegow</i>

<i>and fly him</i>
<i>to the Rock of Eternity!</i>

Then he buys
his mama a pink Cadillac.

Pink Cadillac?
What are you talking about?

Hey, fools! Whoo!

<i>Ohh</i>

<i>Black snake</i>
<i>crawlin' in my room</i>

Come on, Doc, let's go.

<i>Them comic book heroes</i>
<i>all have them super powers.</i>

<i>His was music.</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

<i>Ohh...</i>
<i>Black snake crawlin'</i>
<i>in my room</i>

Move, man. Hey, it's my turn.

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>
<i>Oh, Glory</i>

<i>I'll fly away</i>

<i>When I die</i>

<i>When I die</i>
<i>Hallelujah, by and by</i>

What you doin'?

<i>I'll fly away</i>

<i>-No more preachin', no more</i>
<i>-I'll fly away</i>

<i>-No more pain, no more</i>
<i>-I'll fly away</i>

<i>I'll fly away</i>

<i>No more preachin', I'll fly</i>

<i>No more pain, I'll fly</i>

<i>I'll fly away</i>

Hey, fool, come back.

No. He's with the spirit!

It's all right.

<i>Ohh</i>

<i>Black snake</i>
<i>crawlin' in my room</i>

Whoo!

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>Anyway you choose</i>

<i>I'll fly away, oh, Glory</i>

<i>I'll fly away</i>

<i>Oh, away</i>

<i>-Black snake crawling</i>
<i>in my room</i>
<i>-Hallelujah, by and by</i>

<i>- Ohhh</i>
<i>- I'll fly away</i>

Elvis. Come on,
you gotta get on in.

They've already announced you
on the radio.

Folks are real excited.

<i>At Sun Records,</i>
<i>Sam Phillips was on a mission</i>

<i>to save the world</i>
<i>by recording Black music.</i>

<i>But it didn't sell.</i>

<i>So to pay his bills,</i>

<i>he needed to find a new singer</i>
<i>for his country act.</i>

I don't know what it is
you see in this boy.

I just think he's different.

How do you know
"Big Boy" Crudup?

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right for you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

<i>That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

He's a young singer
from Memphis, Tennessee.

Got a song out
on the Sun label.
It's all over the radio.

Give him a warm Hayride welcome
to a Mr. Elvis Presley.

Elvis,
how are you this evening?

Just fine, how you, sir?

<i>Greasy hair,</i>
<i>girly makeup.</i>

<i>I cannot overstate</i>
<i>how strange he looked.</i>

Are you all geared up
with your band there to...

-I'm all geared up.
-...let us hear your songs?

Uh... well, I'd like to say how
happy we are to be down here.

It's a real honor
for us to be...

Get a chance to appear
on the Louisiana Hayride.

We're gonna do a song for you
we got out on Sun Records.

Uh...

You got anything else
to say, sir?

No. I'm ready.

It goes...

It goes something like this.

<i>Oh, baby, baby,</i>

<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

Get a haircut, fairy!

<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>in a flash of lightning,</i>

<i>I watched that skinny boy</i>
<i>in the pink suit</i>

<i>transform into a superhero.</i>

<i>Well, you may go to college</i>
<i>You may go to school</i>

<i>You may have a pink Cadillac</i>
<i>But don't you be</i>
<i>nobody's fool</i>

<i>Now, baby</i>
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

<i>Well, listen and</i>
<i>I'll tell you, baby</i>

<i>What I'm talking about</i>

<i>Come on back to me,</i>
<i>little girl</i>
<i>So we can play some house</i>

<i>Baby, come back, baby, come</i>

<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

<i>Wanna play house!</i>

-What are they hollerin' at?
-The wiggle!

The what?

Them girls
wanna see you wiggle.

Move, man!

-Do more!
-Much more!

Man!

Do it again.

<i>Well, this is one thing, baby</i>
<i>That I want you to know</i>

<i>Come on back</i>
<i>Let's play a little house</i>

<i>And we can do</i>
<i>what we did before</i>

<i>Now, baby</i>

Sit down!

<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

<i>Come back, baby, come</i>
<i>Come back, baby</i>

What in God's sweet name
am I looking at?

Hit it!

What were you thinking,
Jimmie?

I don't know what I'm thinking.

Please, Lord,
don't let 'em hurt my baby.

Hurt him?
Looks like they wanna--

<i>Baby, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>baby</i>

<i>Now, I don't</i>
<i>know nothin' about music...</i>

<i>...but I could see</i>
<i>in that girl's eyes,</i>

<i>that she was having feelings</i>

<i>she wasn't sure</i>
<i>she should enjoy.</i>

<i>Black snake crawlin' in my room</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>He was a taste</i>
<i>of forbidden fruit.</i>

<i>She could've eaten him alive.</i>

Why are you trying
to kill my son?

<i>It was the greatest</i>
<i>carnival attraction</i>

<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

<i>He was my destiny.</i>

<i>Right under my nose...</i>
<i>In Memphis.</i>

<i>Top of the morning</i>
<i>to you, friends,</i>

<i>from the home of colorful,</i>
<i>old Beale Street.</i>

<i>The place where the blues began</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

<i>Where you see pretty browns</i>
<i>dressed in beautiful gowns,</i>

<i>along with tailor-mades</i>
<i>and hand-me-downs.</i>

<i>Where you see honest men</i>
<i>and pickpockets skilled,</i>

<i>and business never closes</i>
<i>till somebody gets killed.</i>

<i>Now, just kidding.</i>

<i>But there's a lot goin' down</i>
<i>on Beale Street tonight,</i>

<i>and nowhere more-so</i>
<i>than at the Club Handy.</i>

<i>Come around if you wanna see</i>
<i>Big Mama Thornton,</i>

<i>layin' down her newest hit.</i>

<i>Get it, get it</i>

Get it! Come on!

<i>Oh, let's do it</i>

<i>Now, listen up,</i>
<i>while Brown America speaks.</i>

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

<i>Quit snoopin'</i>
<i>'round my door</i>

<i>Just why</i>
<i>a truck driver</i>
<i>from Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

<i>liked to hang out</i>
<i>on Beale Street, I do not know.</i>

<i>You told me</i>
<i>you was high class</i>
<i>But I could see through that...</i>

<i>But it did him no favors,</i>

<i>fitting into them</i>
<i>white housing projects.</i>

Hey, squirrel. Nice shoes.

<i>And, Daddy, I know</i>
<i>That you ain't</i>
<i>no real cool cat</i>

Hey, Elvis!

<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

<i>That's that boy whose record</i>
<i>everybody's talkin' about.</i>

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

<i>Hey, sideburns.</i>
<i>Where's the Negro suit today?</i>

<i>He was crazy</i>
<i>for that Beale Street music.</i>

<i>Beale Street style.</i>

<i>He had Beale Street stars</i>
<i>in his eyes.</i>

What do you think, Tony? Huh?

B.B. King.

<i>No, I didn't take my boy away</i>
<i>from nothin'.</i>

<i>He was runnin'</i>
<i>from the day he was born.</i>

<i>I just opened the door</i>
<i>to our destiny.</i>

<i>So without so much as</i>
<i>a word to your daddy and me,</i>

<i>you quit your job</i>
<i>to go traveling</i>

<i>all the way to Florida</i>
<i>with this Colonel fellow</i>

<i>that we have never met.</i>

Mama, it's only four days.

Yeah, four days.
And then what?

I knew a fella once,
got his record on the radio.

It was all over in a flash.

Mama, I'm just trying
to take care of you and Daddy.

That's all I have
ever cared about.

I ain't ever gonna let us
get back to a place again

where Daddy gets in trouble
with the law

-to put food on the table.
-Elvis!

How dare you?

As the good Lord warns us,

do not wear yourself out
to get rich.

Do not trust your own
goddamn cleverness!

Elvis, you've upset your mama.

You know, Mama,
I was thinkin',

maybe I'll buy you one of them
pink Cadillacs

like you saw back when
you was working
at the hospital.

I don't need no pink Cadillac.

Satnin, I just gotta be making

the most of this thing
while I can.

It's like Daddy says, this
could all be over in a flash.

I'm not fearful
of it being over, Booby.

I don't know how to explain it.

But I saw it
in that girl's eyes.

It's something beyond us,
but I know that whatever it is,

it's something that...

It's something
that can come between us.

Oh, no, Mama, no. Hey.

Ain't nothing ever
gonna do that.

You're my girl. My Satnin.

You'll always be
my bestest girl.

Hey.

-Yeah.
-Yeah?

I will call you every night.

Will you promise me, Booby?

I promise.

I promise. I promise,
I promise.

-All right. I love you.
-Bye, baby.

<i>Nothing but nothing...</i>

I love you.

<i>...is gonna come between us.</i>

Let's go!
Bye, Booby!

See you soon!

Wanna bet?

<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

<i>But stay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

<i>Well, you can knock me down</i>
<i>Step in my face</i>

<i>Your attention, please.</i>

<i>I have some good news.</i>

<i>Our next four nights</i>
<i>are sold out...</i>

<i>...thanks to the dazzling</i>
<i>performances</i>

<i>of our tremendous showman,</i>
<i>Hank Snow.</i>

<i>Pardon me if I'm sentimental</i>
<i>When we say goodbye</i>

<i>And I've noticed</i>
<i>a mild interest</i>

<i>in our newest act,</i>
<i>Elvis Presley.</i>

Hi.

Yeah, Dixie, I'll be back
before prom.

<i>Well you can burn my house</i>
<i>Steal my car</i>

<i>Drink my liquor</i>
<i>From an old fruit jar</i>

<i>Do anything</i>
<i>that you want to do</i>

Colonel,
what is that boy
doing on our tour?

Well, I told you
all about him.

And he wants to record
one of your songs.

Oh? Which one?

All of them.

Well, you warn him plenty.

None of those lewd gyrations
or sudden, jerky movements.

Let's go!

Let's rock!

Is that a pair
of young ladies' intimates

I see upon the stage?

Yes, I believe it is, Hank.

Best not happen
when he sings one of my songs.

I'm sure it won't.

<i>Elvis, the papers say</i>
<i>there are girls</i>

<i>around your hotel</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

<i>I don't even go out, Mama.</i>
<i>I stay in.</i>

<i>You know, it gets lonesome.</i>

<i>I tell you, this</i>
<i>new sensation, Elvis Presley,</i>

<i>he's breaking hearts</i>
<i>all over the South.</i>

Quit knocking at my door,
Scotty.

<i>Are you sorry</i>
<i>We drifted apart?</i>

<i>Never know</i>
<i>How much I love you</i>

<i>Never know how much I care</i>

<i>When you put your arms</i>
<i>around me</i>

<i>Oh, come on, E.P.</i>

Life on the road ain't
the concern of folks back home.

<i>Fever</i>

Why don't you try
one of these?

Put the pep back
into your step.

<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

<i>Well, shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

<i>I said shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>

<i>Well, you won't do right</i>

Whoo!

<i>To save your doggone soul</i>

You're really
something else, man!

I promise,
I'll put my heart in--

I wanna be just like you!

Okay. Yeah, thank you.

I can no longer,
in good conscience,

go on stage with that boy.

Yes, a conundrum. A conundrum.

Please welcome
to the stage, Hank Snow!

After I perform, I shall
spend the night in prayer.

And I will do
what needs to be done.

Come on, Jimmie!

<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

<i>Oh, baby</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

<i>That night,</i>
<i>I happened to see him.</i>

<i>Alone.</i>

<i>Lost.</i>

<i>A snowman is only as good...</i>

<i>as his attraction.</i>

Elvis!

-Come on, man.
-Elvis, come on! Hurry up!

<i>It was all,</i>
<i>or nothing.</i>

Elvis, we're going
to the hall of mirrors!

Wait up!

Screw the hall
of mirrors. That's boring.

Right, hang on.
Here we go.

Hold on.

All right, fellas. Come on.

Oh.
Lost, my boy?

Colonel Parker, sir.

You look lost.

-I guess I am.
-Ah, yes.

The roar of the crowd.
The life on the road.

And then calling home
to your loved ones,

pretending nothing has changed,

when everything has.

Yeah. Lost.

I'm sorry, sir. I... I meant
I don't know the way out.

Yeah, that is precisely
what I am saying.

I... I saw you.
Apart from all the others.

Burdened.

Like you don't know
how to get out of this.

But I do.

<i>Snowman's coming</i>

Allow me to show you.

<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

<i>Take his magic hand</i>

Creatures of the carnival.

And I am one myself.

It's where I learned the art
of the snow job.

Snow job?
Yes.

It's like the trick
you do with the wiggling,

getting all the girls
hyped up,

empty their wallets
and leave them

with nothing but the smiles
on their faces.

I'm no trickster.

Oh, yes, you are.

All showmen are snowmen.

It's a wonderful place.

Nobody on the aerio.

Your future, Mr. Presley,
blazing before you.

Recording contracts,
television, even Hollywood.

You're great, Colonel.

You are the best person
I could ever hope to work with.

You know, this is something
I ain't never

said to nobody before...

But I believe
I can be great, too.

Oh, no doubt.

But we could be
even greater together.

But to achieve this, I need
to represent you exclusively.

Exclusively?
Sir, I... I don't follow.

What about Hank Snow?

Hank. Yes...

He sent me here to fire you.

Hank wants you off the tour.

So I will have to leave Hank.

We will both have to
make sacrifices.

We will need a record label
with national distribution.

RCA?

RCA.

Sam Phillips... discovered me.

I know, but we have a way
to help Sam understand

that it would be foolish of him
to hold you back.

Every man has his price.

RCA does have
the distribution.

I just need to know
that you'll

still be with me as friends.

Don't doubt that,
we're not going anywhere.

Marion and I just don't want to
stand in your way, that's all.

The world needs
to hear you sing, Elvis.

<i>Elvis Presley's</i>
<i>contract sold to RCA today</i>

<i>for the highest price</i>
<i>in music history.</i>

<i>Quite the payday</i>
<i>for Sun Records.</i>

It's just business.
Show business.

To achieve truly great things,

one must make
truly great sacrifices.

You will have to be free
of any entanglements.

You see, my boy,
show business is snow business.

<i>And the fans need to believe</i>
<i>that you are always available.</i>

The Colonel says
that with all the publicity

that's gonna be coming,

he might have to
put it out there that...

That...

I don't have a girl.

Then we will need
your parents' legal commitment.

They may need a bit
of convincing themselves.

Sam Phillips
is a good man we can trust.

We don't know this Colonel
from a nail in a wall.

Is there a lawyer
representing the family?

Oh, unnecessary.

I am of the firm opinion

that family is the most
important thing in the world.

In mind of that,
I have taken the liberty

of making these contracts out

in the name
of Elvis Presley Enterprises.

A family business.

And I was thinking,
Vernon Presley:

Business Manager.

What do you think,
Daddy?

Uh... Well, uh...

I like it very much, son.
Ah!

Mrs. Presley,
your son has a unique gift.

It's as though
he has the strength

of two men inside of him.

<i>You know, Colonel,</i>
<i>I would do anything</i>

<i>to make sure my mama and daddy</i>
<i>never have to live</i>

<i>in no poverty ever again.</i>

Mama, it's gonna turn out
so, so good.

Mm.

Colonel, I wasn't fooling
when I told those other kids

I was gonna buy 'em
a Cadillac one day.

My boy, with me, you will
buy them two Cadillacs.

Two?

A hundred?

Two hundred.

-A thousand.
-A million.

An aeroplane.

How about a rocket ship?

Well, maybe not a rocket ship.
My mama don't like me to fly.

But me, I've always
wanted to fly. Fast.

Faster than the speed of light
to the Rock of Eternity.

What? To the Rock of Eternity?

Captain Marvel, Jr.

He's my favorite
comic book hero.

He flies.

Well, what about you,
Mr. Presley?

Are you ready to fly?

Yes, sir. I'm ready.

Ready to fly.

<i>Uh, Mr. Presley,</i>

<i>try not to move around</i>
<i>so much during the takes.</i>

If I can't move,
I can't sing.

<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

<i>What is he doing?</i>
<i>We paid for this?</i>

<i>It's down at the end of</i>
<i>Lonely Street at...</i>

<i>It's a suicide song.</i>

<i>...Heartbreak Hotel</i>

<i>Them know-it-alls</i>
<i>said I'd backed</i>
<i>the wrong horse.</i>

<i>But my boy knew teenagers.</i>

<i>And that first record</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

<i>Well, it's so very hard to have</i>
<i>To leave the one you love</i>

<i>And you get more lonely</i>
<i>With each passing day</i>

<i>It's so lonely just sitting</i>
<i>And dreaming of...</i>

<i>In a few short months,</i>

<i>Elvis Presley has popped</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

<i>Everywhere he goes,</i>
<i>he causes riots,</i>

<i>mountains of press</i>
<i>and rivers of money.</i>

<i>It's another</i>
<i>gold record for Elvis Presley.</i>

<i>This one giving him his first</i>
<i>worldwide hit.</i>

Mrs. Presley, look!

Come on, Mrs. Presley,
let me show you
how to use this.

Come on, hens! Come on, hens!
Come on!

Come on! Outside!
Out of my house!

Come on, this way!
Come on, babies!

Dodger!

Go, Billy boy!
Ya-hoo-hoo!

<i>I took</i>
<i>my boy's wiggling</i>

<i>and put it in the movies.</i>

<i>I took his name and face,</i>

<i>and put it on all sorts of toys</i>

<i>and knick-knacks,</i>
<i>and called it...</i>

"Merchandise."

Your face on every
conceivable object,

including teddy bear, perfume,
plaster busts...

Of questionable likeness.

"The Elvis Presley Game."

Something so everyone
can show their love.

Grandma Dodger,
what is that behind your ear?

"I hate Elvis."

Huh?

Yes. I hate Elvis.

In my way of thinking,
"I love Elvis,"

that's an easy sell.

Those who hate your son
will do so

whether we profit
from it or not.

After all, what is hate worth
if it's free?

Oh, yeah. I get it.

Snowman strikes again.

Merchandise, promotion.
 Diskin, what else do we have?

Necklaces.
Necklaces.

Scarves.
Oh, scarves. Yes...

<i>Mr. Presley</i>
<i>and Mr. King...</i>

regular peas in a pod,

relieving me
of my finest threads.

Must be some occasion.

Mr. Lansky, it's Milton Berle.

The whole of America'll
be watching.

I don't watch television.

So what's it gonna be?

How you gonna
blow their wigs off?

Well, the network
wants me to do a ballad.

But I'm thinking about
cuttin' it up with "Hound Dog."

Whoo!

Elvis Presley, "Hound Dog,"
and Uncle Miltie.

Strange things
are happening every day.

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog, hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

<i>And you ain't</i>
<i>no friend of mine</i>

<i>When they said</i>
<i>You was high classed</i>

<i>Well, that was just a lie</i>

<i>Yeah, they said</i>
<i>You were high classed</i>

Behold, tomorrow,
all of America

will be talking
about Elvis Presley.

<i>My wiggling boy.</i>

Even as a little one,
he made me laugh so.

He's so funny!

<i>You never caught a rabbit</i>
<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog,</i>
<i>a hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

And, Senator,
for the next leg

of your racial integrity tour,

we booked the Overton
Park Shell in Memphis.

What are they laughing about?

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

Who the hell is that?

It's that boy from Memphis.

Elvis Presley.

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

A white boy from Memphis,
moving like a goddamn--

<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain</i>

<i>Shall I come back...</i>

<i>The obscenity and vulgarity</i>
<i>of this rock and roll music</i>

<i>is obviously a means by which</i>
<i>the white man and his children</i>

<i>can be driven to the level</i>
<i>of the Negro.</i>

<i>The colored folks have</i>
<i>been singing and playing it</i>

<i>just like</i>
<i>I'm doing it now, man,</i>
<i>more years than I know.</i>

Colonel Parker,
we called you in here

to talk about this act
of yours.

<i>A petition</i>
<i>has begun circulating</i>

<i>to bar Elvis Presley</i>
<i>from television.</i>

<i>We've set up a committee</i>

<i>to keep an eye on this vulgar,</i>
<i>animalistic rock and roll bum.</i>

<i>Your style</i>
<i>of gyrating while you sing</i>

<i>has been bitterly criticized...</i>

I don't feel I'm doing
anything wrong.

<i>We simply will not</i>
<i>advertise on any station</i>

<i>that puts this delinquent</i>
<i>on television.</i>

Colonel, you put an end
to your boy's animal behavior,

<i>or we will.</i>

<i>Don't worry, Senator,</i>
<i>my boy does what he's told.</i>

<i>Tell me, dear</i>

<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

"Elvis the Pelvis."

That's one of the most childish
expressions I've ever heard

coming from an adult.

Is Mr. Allen gonna cancel me
from the show?

Yes.

Yes, he is.

He is replacing you with one of
the country's greatest singers.

Mario Lanza?

Someone greater.

The new Elvis Presley!

Yeah, I snowed 'em!

You just have to put on
one of these tails here,

can sing the "Hound Dog,"

and it's a light-hearted,
sophisticated family show.

I can't move in one of these.

And that is the point.

Mr. Allen agreed only as long

as there is no wiggling
of those hips.

I can't figure it out. My own
mother approves of what I do.

Mmm.

You have read the papers,
my boy?

Yeah, I read the papers.

The papers say that I shot
my mother and smoke marijuana.

Your movement's
in the style of a Black man,

and you have broken
the segregation laws.

So let's follow the plan.
It's a good plan.

You do the <i>Allen Show,</i>
family style,

and then tomorrow
we go back to Memphis and

we snow them on the July 4th
Children's Charitable Concert.

And we put this whole
unfortunate misstep behind us.

Now, do you want
to go into politics?

Or shall we stay
in show business?

<i>We want to do</i>
<i>a show the whole family</i>

<i>can watch and enjoy,</i>
<i>and we always do.</i>

<i>And at this time, it gives me</i>
<i>extreme pleasure to introduce</i>

<i>the new Elvis Presley!</i>

<i>He used to be so hip.</i>

<i>He looked so silly.</i>

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he looked like a butler.</i>

<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he agreed to sing to a dog.</i>

God damn it!

He could've given us
some warning.

I know how to do a skit,
I could've made it funny!

The most stupid, embarrassing,
humiliating thing I ever did.

Well, what the hell
do you want me to do about it?

We're musicians!

<i>It's just embarrassing.</i>

<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

<i>She just went on</i>
<i>and on about the damn dog.</i>

And I said, "Neighbors
shouldn't speak like that."

And then she said...

I like the bit with the dog.

It was the most embarrassing
performance of my life, Daddy.

She wasn't the only one
who said it.

-All the neighbors did.
-Oh, God.

Those New York people
were using you

to poke fun at the whole South.

Getting a laugh out of putting
a hillbilly in a tailcoat

and singing to a dog.

God damn it, Mama, it was
either that or I get canceled.

Then that's it for television.

Colonel says I'm running out
of states that I'm welcome in.

And they don't pay
unless I can perform.

So Colonel says I play the
charity concert tomorrow night,

as the new family style,

then everybody calms down
and we get back on track.

Someone's got to think about
keeping a roof over our heads.

Roof over our head?

We've always managed to keep
a roof over our head, Vernon.

Mama, Daddy is
business manager.
It's his job.

That's right.

We was doing just fine
before that man came along.

Colonel has got us all of this.

I don't want all this!
You're unhappy!

I am not!

You're losing yourself, Booby!

Oh, hell, Mama, I--

Satnin knows.

The way you sing
and move...

it's God-given.

So there can't be nothing
wrong with it.

Hey, I'm gonna ask cousin
about the movie.

Hey, E.P., E.P.!

Can we close down
the movie house

and watch <i>Godzilla</i> tonight?

Don't tramp mud
in the house, Billy!

But you said
we could watch the movie!

Get out! Get out of my
goddamn house!

You said you'd take us!
 -Tramping mud in my house

and doing my damn head in.

Mama, you ain't never happy.

No matter what I do,
no matter how much I give you,

it ain't never enough.

And, I wish you would not drink
so goddamn much.

It's not good for you.

Baby!

-Put that back in the shed!
-Elvis, wait!

Elvis! Elvis, come on!
Elvis!

<i>Here's Elvis Presley.</i>

<i>This is</i>
<i>Rufus Thomas here from WDIA.</i>

<i>You can catch B.B. King tonight</i>
<i>at Club Handy,</i>

<i>with Sister Rosetta Tharpe.</i>

Hello.

E.P.!

B.B.! Hey!
Get over here!

Have a good night.

Thank you. Have a good night.

Hello.

Hey!

Get him! Get him in here!
E.P.! E.P.!

All right, all right.
Thank you.

<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop</i>
<i>Ba-lop, bom, bom</i>

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

Got my mama going on
about the "Hound Dog,"

and the Colonel's
got me wearing tails,

and everybody wants
something different.

Hey, listen, man.

If you're sad
and you want to be sad,

you're at the right place.

If you're happy and you want
to be happy, guess what?

You're at the right place.

So just do me a favor...

Let it all hang out.

Let it all hang out, E.P.!

Let it all hang out, baby.

<i>She rocks to the east</i>
<i>She rocks to the west</i>

<i>But she's the girl that</i>
<i>I love best</i>

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty, uh!</i>

Hey, man.

<i>Tutti frutti,</i>
<i>oh rooty, whoo!</i>

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

<i>Tutti frutti,</i>
<i>oh rooty</i>

<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop--</i>

Whoo! Man, he's cuttin' it!

Sister Rosetta found this kid
in the backwaters of Georgia.

They should get the Colonel
to book him on Steve Allen.

They would love his moves.

<i>Got a girl named Daisy</i>

<i>She almost drives me crazy</i>

<i>Got a girl named Daisy</i>

Whoo!

<i>She almost drives me crazy</i>

<i>She knows how to love me</i>
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

<i>Boy, you don't know</i>
<i>What she do to me</i>

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

Man, he sings the hell
out of that song!

I would love to record that.

If you do, you'll make
a whole lot more money

than that kid
could ever dream of.

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop,</i>
<i>Ba-lop, bom, bom</i>

<i>I'm a-workin'</i>
<i>on the building</i>

<i>Workin'</i>
<i>on the building</i>

<i>It's the new foundation</i>

<i>The new foundation</i>

<i>I'm goin' to heaven</i>

Yeah!

<i>Goin' to heaven</i>

<i>To get my reward</i>

<i>Get my reward</i>

Whoo!

Ha-ha! That's all right.

That's a nice ride
you rode up in tonight.

It ain't like your ol'
big B.B. King bus.

Big Red.

Yeah, well, I can go where
I want, play what I want,

and if they don't like it,
I can go someplace else.

You've got to be
in control, man.

You should have your own label,
like me.

You don't do the business,
the business will do you.

Man, I just leave all that
to the Colonel.

So it's, um...

It's his idea, this new Elvis?

Listen, I don't get it, man.

Cats buy your records
because they like what you do,

not because you're dressed up
like some... like some butler.

You really think those kids
want to see Elvis the butler

at the Russwood Park
gig tomorrow?

Man, I ain't wearing no tails.

I just...
gotta lay off the moves,
is all.

Colonel says if I don't,
they're gonna put me in jail.

Come on, man.

They're not gonna
put you in jail.

They might put me in jail
for walking across the street,

but you're a famous white boy.

Too many people are making
too much money off of you

to put you in jail.

You think so?

I know so.

Colonel's a smart man.
There's gotta be
another reason.

<i>Every day, yes</i>

<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

Hey, Elvis, B.B.!
Give us a smile.

<i>Every day</i>

<i>You promised us</i>
<i>a new Elvis, Colonel.</i>

Yet, here he is with this
B.B. King at Club Handy,

jiggling and wiggling
with Billy Ward, and here,

on Colored Night
at the Memphis Fairgrounds.

We've been poking
into your background,

and we've found your records.

"Unfit for military duty."

"Acute psychopathic state."

Well... I was pretending
to be crazy. I wanted out.

I was just a boy
from Huntington, West Virginia.

Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

<i>Every day, yeah</i>

<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

<i>Every day</i>
<i>Are so strange</i>

<i>Every day</i>
<i>People are stealing the planes</i>

<i>Oh! There are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

<i>Every day</i>
<i>Oh, ain't that</i>
<i>strange, every day</i>

<i>Every day, yes</i>

<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

<i>While 10,000 screaming</i>
<i>fans were cramming in</i>

<i>to see our show,</i>
<i>Senator Eastland was holding</i>

<i>a segregationist rally</i>
<i>just three miles away.</i>

The mayor loved you
on the <i>Steve Allen Show.</i>

All the important people did.

What song are you going
to sing tonight?

I've made no decision.

I'll feel it.

Pay no mind
to all the cameras.

Those are our friends
in the vice squad.

They don't mean nothing.
Ain't that right, chief?

As long as you don't
so much as wiggle a finger.

Oh, yes, sir,
good people!

A big thank you
to Shorty Morgan's Dixie Dolls!

But I know some of
the young people

are very excited
about this next act!

Jesse's with us tonight, baby.

Play it smart out there, yeah?

<i>Well, stop talking about it</i>
<i>We're talking</i>
<i>about everything</i>

<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

Elvis Presley!

<i>Strange things happening</i>
<i>Every day</i>

Just sing the nice song.
Smile the nice smile.

No wiggling.

Then we can get back
to our show business.

And have fun, my boy! Fun!

<i>Oh, we want peace!</i>

<i>We want peace!</i>

<i>We oughta stop</i>
<i>talkin' about it</i>
<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

<i>Oh, there are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

<i>Every day</i>

There's been a lot of talk
about the new Elvis.

And of course, that other guy.

<i>You ain't</i>
<i>Nothin' but a hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

<i>...at his</i>
<i>command, both civil and other,</i>

<i>to maintain public order,</i>
<i>and prevent crime and riots.</i>

<i>He can use those forces...</i>

to prevent the racial
integration of schools,

if this is necessary, under the
police powers of that state...

There's a lot of people
saying a lot of things.

<i>...in fact, it is his duty...</i>

Of course you gotta listen
to the people that you love.

<i>...and prevent</i>
<i>turmoil</i>
<i>and strife within the state.</i>

But in the end,
you gotta listen to yourself.

So I want you to know,
those New York people

ain't gonna change me none.

<i>...the subversives who own...</i>

...control and dominate
the entertainment industry...

"Trouble."
<i>... are determined...</i>

...to spread
Africanized culture...

I'm gonna show you what
the real Elvis is like tonight!

<i>...influencing your children...</i>

to accept the Negroes.

<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

-No.
-What's going on?

<i>You came to the right place</i>

<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

<i>Just look right in my face</i>

<i>I was born standing up</i>

<i>And talking back</i>

<i>My daddy was a green-eyed</i>
<i>Mountain jack</i>

<i>Because I'm evil</i>

<i>My middle name is misery</i>

<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

<i>So don't you mess</i>
<i>around with me</i>

<i>I've never looked</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

<i>But I never ran</i>

<i>I don't take no orders</i>

<i>From no kind of man</i>

<i>I'm only made out</i>

<i>Of flesh, blood and bone</i>

<i>But if you're gonna</i>
<i>Start a rumble</i>

<i>Don't you try it on alone</i>

<i>Because I'm evil</i>

<i>My middle name is misery</i>

Elvis!

<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

<i>So don't you</i>
<i>mess around with me</i>

<i>I'm evil, evil</i>
<i>evil as can be</i>

<i>I'm evil</i>
<i>evil, evil as can be</i>

<i>So don't mess around</i>

<i>Don't mess around with me</i>

<i>I'm evil</i>

<i>I'm evil</i>

<i>Evil, evil</i>

Uh, now would be a good time
to get back into the car.

<i>I'm evil</i>

<i>Evil</i>

<i>Evil</i>

Our friends at RCA
are not gonna
be happy when they see this.

<i>He didn't listen</i>
<i>to me.</i>

<i>Why?</i>

<i>Why didn't he listen to me?</i>

<i>I'm evil</i>

Get my boy off that stage!

<i>...with me</i>

Get your hands
off him. Hey!

Hey, Elvis!

Elvis!

Go look after the merchandise.
Look after the merchandise!

Elvis, come on!

Get off of me!
Mama, you get in the car!

Get in the car!

You're gonna get us in trouble.

He's all right, come on.

Elvis!
Scotty, come on.

Let's go.

<i>My dear boy</i>
<i>had chosen.</i>

<i>You, his audience, his fans.</i>

<i>He had no idea</i>
<i>what he had done</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

<i>We warned you, Colonel.</i>

<i>You've lost control</i>
<i>of this act of yours.</i>

<i>And he's dividing this nation.</i>

<i>There are a lot of people</i>
<i>who want to see him in jail.</i>

<i>I had to find</i>
<i>a way out.</i>

<i>A way to save him.</i>

<i>Crawfish</i>

<i>Crawfish</i>

No. There's no way my baby's
going to Germany for two years.

It is either the army or jail.

There is something else.

Vernon, they are poking
into your background.

We don't have nothin'
to be ashamed of!

Now, my daddy is a good man.

Yes, yes.
But your papa did go to jail.

You know them,
and their flashy headlines.

"Elvis, The Draft Dodger."
"A Family of Delinquents."

<i>There was no moon</i>

We may never
book another date,
or sell another record again.

And my way of thinking,

the army could be
a brand new start
for all of us.

<i>Let them cut your hair.</i>

Prove to the world that you are
a clean-cut, all-American boy.

<i>You do your two years, and when</i>
<i>you come back, I promise you</i>

<i>I will have done</i>
<i>everything I can</i>

<i>to make you the biggest</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood.</i>

You will choose
your own pictures.

It's gonna be okay, Mama.

<i>And I pulled Mr. Crawfish</i>
<i>out of his hole</i>

<i>Young Mr. Presley,</i>
<i>a rock and roller no more.</i>

<i>He'll do six months'</i>
<i>basic training at Fort Chaffee</i>

<i>before shipping off to Germany.</i>

<i>Since the day</i>
<i>he was born,</i>

<i>she had feared</i>
<i>losing her second son.</i>

<i>While he was</i>
<i>in basic training...</i>

<i>she worried and drank...</i>

<i>Worried...</i>

<i>and drank.</i>

Hey...

Alberta!

Oh, no...

No!

There are some fine folks
from the press waiting outside.

A few questions, pictures,
and they will leave us alone.

I can't get him to do anything.

He trusted her
like nobody else,

and now she's gone
and who does he have now?

Well...

He trusts you.

Can you talk to him?

Oh, no.

It's not my place...

Can you do it, Colonel?

We need your help now.

Your daddy is doing
the best he knows how,

but he is overwhelmed.

He needs your help out there.

I can't go out there.
I just wanna stay here forever.

Oh, my boy.

No one could never
replace her.

But you listen to me.

From this moment on,
anything she would have done...

I will carry out, in her name.

When you are overseas,
I will stay here at home.

And I will work,
and I will worry.

Trust me.

Now, you go and you stand
by your papa.

You comfort him.

You comfort him.

Comfort your friends
and your family,

and even your fans. Hmm?

Because if you don't do that...

all that your mama
has sacrificed for you

will be for nothing.

No matter what happens,

you stay with me
through thick and thin, okay?

You're like a...
like a father to me.

<i>I needed</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

<i>Even from himself.</i>

<i>My plan, Elvis Presley</i>
<i>would return</i>

<i>a clean-cut, all-American boy.</i>

<i>But...</i>

<i>...I did not consider</i>

<i>the most dangerous thing</i>
<i>of all.</i>

<i>Love.</i>

<i>Priscilla,</i>
<i>the pretty teenage daughter</i>

<i>of a United States</i>
<i>Air Force officer.</i>

And then he said to me...

"You know what, Priscilla?

You gotta listen to me,
sweetie,

because this guy, he's got
girls all over the world, okay?

He's got girls waiting
outside of his house

and girls writing him
endless fan mail."

And then Mommy decides
to pitch in and go,

"Ooh, what could he possibly
see in you, okay?

What do you two do
up there all night?"

And--

And I just said, "Mom, Dad...

we talk and we listen
to music, okay? That's all."

And then they were going on
and on about that photo of you

and Natalie Wood riding around
on that bike in Memphis,

and...
and then what I said...

And I said this really calmly,
I said, "Listen, okay?

He's just really lonely.
And quite frankly, so am I."

And then
they didn't really know
what to say after that,

so I went upstairs
and I went to bed.

Never met anyone like you.

Well, I hope not.

So... what
is Natalie Wood like?

She's nice, you know.

She's been writing me
about acting.

I've been asking her
stories about...

working with James Dean and...

God, I just hope to one day
be as good as him, you know?

Mmm.

Colonel's promised me
that when I get back

he's gonna set me up
in Hollywood
to be a serious actor.

That's really what I dream of.

Hey, E.P., E.P.,
now, you promised the captain

that you'd get her home
by 7:00.

Hey, Charlie.
What's that behind you?

What? No...

He don't boss me around.

You know, I think
if you dream it, you'll do it.

You do?

Yeah.

<i>Shall I stay?</i>

<i>Would it be a sin</i>

<i>If I can't help</i>

<i>Falling in love with you?</i>

<i>You no longer</i>
<i>want to sing in your films,</i>

<i>is that right?</i>
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>a dramatic actor.</i>

<i>Well, sir, that's</i>
<i>my big ambition now.</i>

<i>It takes a lot of time,</i>
<i>a lot of experience.</i>

<i>He was</i>
<i>as good as Brando.</i>

<i>But you didn't want to see him</i>
<i>in movies where he didn't sing.</i>

<i>A little less conversation</i>

<i>A little more action</i>

<i>All this aggravation</i>
<i>Ain't satisfactioning me</i>

<i>Thanks to me, his life</i>
<i>became one big Hollywood movie!</i>

<i>Starring Priscilla...</i>

<i>Bright light city</i>
<i>gonna set my soul</i>

<i>Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

<i>And a cast</i>
<i>of his "buddies" and "cousins."</i>

<i>His Memphis Mafia.</i>

<i>So get those stakes</i>
<i>up higher</i>

<i>There's a thousand</i>
<i>pretty women</i>
<i>Waitin' out there</i>

<i>And they're all livin'</i>
<i>The devil may care</i>

<i>And I'm just the devil</i>
<i>With love to spare, so</i>

<i>Viva, Las Vegas</i>

<i>There was that</i>
<i>fairytale wedding.</i>

<i>And the honeymoon</i>
<i>on Frank Sinatra's jet.</i>

<i>And introducing</i>
<i>Baby Lisa Marie.</i>

<i>I made him the highest paid</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood history.</i>

<i>We had a lot of fun!</i>

<i>But Elvis was a young man,</i>

<i>and of course,</i>
<i>he got distracted.</i>

<i>So we made them faster</i>
<i>and cheaper.</i>

<i>Beatlemania sweeps America,</i>

<i>as teens turn their attention</i>
<i>to the teenage rockers.</i>

<i>Is it my fault</i>
<i>the world changed?</i>

<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,</i>

<i>the apostle of non-violence</i>
<i>in the Civil Rights movement,</i>

<i>has been shot to death</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

<i>New Elvis stinker</i>
<i>bombs, another flop.</i>

<i>There's no more appetite</i>
<i>for Presley pictures.</i>

<i>It don't matter</i>
<i>how hard I worked,</i>

<i>how many snow jobs</i>
<i>I came up with,</i>

<i>how much snow I made them.</i>

<i>My boy loved to spend.</i>

<i>And with them hillbillies</i>
<i>around him,</i>

<i>the money would just melt away.</i>

With the sale of the ranch
and the horses,

that's gonna cover the payroll,

but as for the security
at Graceland...

<i>Officers also reportedly chased</i>

<i>Dr. King was standing</i>

Elvis Presley's
<i>Wonderful World of Christmas.</i>

Brought to you by

the Singer Sewing Machine
Company,

to every television set
in America.

It only takes three days
to tape,

and there's no audience.

<i>Violence breeds violence,</i>

<i>- repression breeds retaliation.</i>
...Christmas sweater.

Made on the new Singer,
home knitting apparatus.

-Memphis is burning.
<i>-...and to fear his brother.</i>

<i>When you teach</i>
<i>that he is a lesser man</i>

<i>because of his color</i>
<i>or his beliefs...</i>

...dreaming
of a white Christmas,

because, oh,
it's definitely going to snow.

Christmas special.

Is this the best we can do,
Admiral?

Well, we took
the Hollywood phonies

for every nickel they had

and now it is time
for us to pack up our tents

and move on
to even greener pastures.

We've seen "Elvis the Rebel,"

we've seen
"Elvis the Movie Star."

Now we will see
"Elvis the Family Entertainer."

And appliance salesman?

What did you say?

Listen, Jerry,
I don't need you to question me

about how I support my family
and every goddamn person here.

You understand me?

If you don't like it,
you can go back to Memphis.

Laugh it up, assholes.

<i>What</i>
<i>a beautiful rendition</i>

<i>...made right at home</i>
<i>on the Singer Sewer</i>
<i>SK155 home knitter.</i>

<i>And now, here's Elvis!</i>

Can I watch the memorial
with you?

Yeah, baby.

I'm so tired of playing
Elvis Presley.

Too many people rely on me.

I love you.

And your daughter loves you.

We don't care about the money
or anything else.

We just want you to be happy.

<i>Lord, hold my hand</i>

<i>And don't let me fall</i>

You're only really happy when
you sing the music you love.

<i>Oh</i>

<i>Take my hand</i>

Mahalia Jackson.

I used to hear her sing
at East Street Church.

<i>Got a feelin' in my body</i>

That's the music
that makes me happy.

<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

So when things are too
dangerous to say... sing!

<i>When Moses walked the children</i>
<i>out of Egypt land</i>

<i>He said "Now don't you worry</i>
<i>we're in the lord's hands"</i>

<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

<i>We'll be released</i>
<i>from all our sorrow</i>

<i>Leave it layin' along the way</i>

<i>You gotta meet these</i>
<i>Binder and Bones guys, E.P.</i>

<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>that put James Brown,</i>

<i>the Rolling Stones onstage.</i>

<i>They're doing some</i>
<i>cutting edge stuff.</i>

Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe...
thanks for coming.

When I first came
to Hollywood, I'd come up here

and sit for hours.

Right over there,
the observatory...

that's where they shot
<i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

Man, I used to dream of being
a great actor like Jimmy Dean.

This sign was beautiful then.

And now...

Feels as though lots of things
are like that these days.

Broke down, beat up.

Rotten.

I really like
what you guys did,

putting James Brown
and the Stones together.

We're, uh...
big fans of yours, too.

It's just that, Mr. Presley,
we don't usually--

Oh, Elvis.

Elvis, uh...

Christmas specials
aren't really our thing.

I know.

Tell me, honestly...

where do you boys
think my career's at right now?

Well, it's...

It's in the toilet, Elvis.

You hear that, Jerry?

Oh, Lord. I knew you were
the right guys for this job.

You know,
back when I was starting out,

some people wanted
to put me in jail,

even kill me,
'cause of the way I was moving.

So they cut my hair,

they put me in uniform
and they sent me away.

That killed my mother.

And ever since then...

I've been lost.

And when you're lost,
people take advantage.

I need you fellas to help me
get back to who I really am.

And who are you, Elvis?

I sure as hell ain't somebody
who sings Christmas songs

by a fireplace for an hour.

And what
does the Colonel think?

I don't give a damn
what the Colonel thinks.

For this television special,

we've got this Bindle fella,
number one hotshot director.

Elvis will be humoring him by
doing a few of his fresh ideas.

Ah, the sweater!

To Mr. Presley's
dressing room, please.

We are going to sing three
spectacular Christmas songs

in that very sweater.

Now, when that sign lights up,
what do you do?

Applause.

"Silent is the Night"
and "Deck the Halls,"

and, uh...
"Whose Child Is This?"

<i>You think</i>
<i>we can do some gospel?</i>

Well, if you want
to find yourself,

first thing you do is go home.

Metaphorically, you know.
Get back to who you really are.

And what is the boy that--

-Oh, "The Little Drummer Boy"?
-Yes, "The Little
Drumming Boy."

Oh, the... with the...

<i>We get your old band</i>
<i>back together.</i>

But we are going to start with
"Here Comes Santa Claus,"

isn't that right, Mr. Bindle?

Uh, the Christmas specials
come later in the show.

Can you bring up two?

<i>A leather jacket.</i>
<i>Raw, dirty.</i>

Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
this is television, not radio,

so when that goes up
and you clap,

let's see it
on your faces as well.

<i>But you need</i>
<i>an audience.</i>

<i>Audience?</i>

Bring it over to one.
<i>- At any second now,</i>

Elvis is gonna walk onto this
stage and perform just for you.

<i>I ain't sang in front</i>
<i>of an audience in a long time.</i>

<i>That's my point.</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Elvis Presley!

<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

<i>Well, it's down at the end</i>
<i>Of Lonely Street</i>

<i>At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

<i>Where I'll be</i>
<i>I'll be so lonely, baby</i>

<i>I'll be so lonely</i>

<i>I'll be so lonely</i>
<i>I could die</i>

<i>Well, the bellhop's tears</i>
<i>Keep flowin'</i>

<i>And the desk clerk's</i>
<i>Dressed in black</i>

<i>Well, they've been so long</i>
<i>On Lonely Street</i>

<i>Well, they'll never</i>
<i>They'll never look back</i>

<i>They'll be so lonely, baby</i>

<i>They'll be so lonely</i>

<i>They'll be so lonely</i>
<i>They could die</i>

Well, that was... energetic.

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

<i>Snoopin' at my door</i>

<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

Come on!

Colonel...

Is "Here Comes
Santa Claus" next?

Absolutely.

I see no reason why not.

He's not in the swe-- he's not
even wearing the sweater.

<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

I do not know
what is going on.

Singing "Hound Dog"?

What does that have to do
with Christmas?

<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Baby</i>

<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

<i>Blue, blue</i>
<i>blue suede shoes</i>

<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

<i>But lay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

Young man, you tell them

it's time for "Here Comes
Santa Claus." I said so. Now!

All right. First positions!

<i>Warden threw a party</i>
<i>In the county jail</i>

<i>The prison band was there</i>
<i>And they began to wail</i>

<i>The band was jumping</i>
<i>And the joint began to swing</i>

<i>You shoulda heard</i>
<i>Those knocked out</i>
<i>jailbirds sing</i>

<i>Let's rock</i>
<i>All right, everybody,</i>
<i>let's rock</i>

<i>Everybody in the whole</i>
<i>Cell block</i>

<i>Was dancing to the</i>
<i>Jailhouse Rock</i>

<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

<i>They were dancin'</i>

<i>Well, they were dancin'</i>

<i>To the Jailhouse Rock</i>

Hah!

All right.

It's been a long time, baby.

A long time.

<i>Well, I like a lot</i>
<i>of the new groups,</i>

<i>you know, the Beatles</i>
<i>and the Byrds, but,</i>

a lot of it is basically--

rock and roll music
is basically, uh...

gospel or rhythm and blues.

Well, that's one thing about
this TV special that I'm doing,

<i>they're gonna let me do</i>
<i>what I want to do.</i>

<i>Sing the music that I want.</i>

Music that I love.

Music that makes me happy.

<i>Those know-it-all</i>
<i>hippies had brainwashed Elvis,</i>

<i>acting like he was</i>
<i>one of them radicals,</i>

<i>throwing his career away</i>
<i>to sing spirituals</i>

<i>with a bunch of longhairs.</i>

Bindle...

-Cue the gospel number now. Go.
-"Here Comes Santa Claus."

<i>Up above my head</i>

<i>There is music in the air</i>

No.

<i>Up above my head</i>

All right, none of this
will be in the special.

Can you make a note that
that should be in the special?

Okay, now let's segue straight
into the whorehouse dancers.
Go!

Whorehouse? No.

Now bring in
the kung fu spectacular.

What? Kung fu?

<i>If you ever take a trip</i>
<i>Down to the ocean</i>

<i>Find yourself down</i>
<i>around Mobile</i>

This has nothing
to do with Christmas!

You'll be hearing
from our lawyers.

But, we still have
"Here Comes Santa Claus"!

Santa Claus is bringing you
a lawsuit!

<i>Digging the finest</i>
<i>Little five-piece group</i>

<i>Up and down the</i>
<i>Gulf of Mexico</i>

<i>Guess who's leading</i>
<i>That five-piece band</i>

<i>Well, wouldn't you know</i>

<i>It's that swinging little</i>
<i>Guitar man</i>

<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

<i>Just put your arms around me</i>
<i>Real tight</i>

<i>We'll be released</i>
<i>From all our sorrow</i>

<i>Leave it layin'</i>
<i>along the way</i>

<i>Well, I'm the king</i>
<i>of the jungle</i>
<i>They call me the Tiger Man</i>

<i>I got a--</i>
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

Bobby Kennedy been shot!

Bobby Kennedy's
been shot, everybody!

<i>Senator Kennedy</i>
<i>has been shot.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Senator Kennedy has been shot.</i>

<i>Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

<i>Take a hold of his thumb</i>
<i>and break it if you have to!</i>

<i>Get his gun!</i>

We're ready on set.

Oh, my God.

<i>...Senator Kennedy</i>
<i>was involved in a shooting,</i>

<i>that a newsman was involved,</i>

<i>and that one other man</i>
<i>was involved.</i>

<i>There are now three doctors</i>
<i>back there caring for them.</i>

Steve, we gotta
get back to work.

Work?

<i>...amount of blood on the floor</i>
<i>of this anteroom.</i>

<i>Ice is now being, uh, brought--</i>

Listen, I, uh...

I just want to say that...

...that this nation is hurting.

It's lost. You know? It...

It needs a voice right now
to help it heal.

We have to say something.

You...

have to make
a statement, E.P.

Mr. Presley does not
make statements.

He sings
"Here Comes Santa Claus"

and wishes everyone,

"Merry Christmas
and good night."

<i>...Senator Kennedy's</i>
<i>press secretary</i>

<i>was made roughly an hour</i>
<i>and a half ago.</i>

<i>Some five to ten minutes later,</i>
<i>the operation began.</i>

<i>The six-man team</i>
<i>of neurosurgeons</i>

<i>probing for the bullet</i>
<i>that had lodged</i>

<i>in Senator Kennedy's brain.</i>

<i>No report yet</i>
<i>as to how that operation...</i>

Poor Mrs. Kennedy.

This tragedy...

A tragedy.

But it has nothing
to do with us.

<i>The White House</i>
<i>has reacted to the shooting...</i>

It has everything
to do with us.

No, I just do not think

we should be making speeches
about politics and religion.

Dr. King was shot
eight miles from Graceland

while I was out here
singing to turtles.

And now this, and all you can
think about is how many

goddamn sweaters I can sell?

I am a promoter.
That is what I do.

And I'm Elvis Presley.
That's what I do.

Well, Mr. Bindle has really
gotten inside your head

with all of his hippie friends.

You actually think that
you singing your old songs

dressed in black leather,

sweating, mumbling incoherently
to the audience

was a good show?

Colonel, I know when
I've excited an audience.

That was not a real audience,
my boy.

There was a sign
flashing "applaud,"

telling them
when to clap for you.

This entire jamboree
is an embarrassment.

You have embarrassed
the sponsors,

you have embarrassed yourself,

you have embarrassed me.

Now, you can sing
whatever songs

you and Mr. Bindle choose
for 55 minutes,

but at the end of the show,
there will be a Christmas song.

Or else we will be sued.

No, you will be sued
for breach of contract,

because I will no longer be
the promoter of your career.

I will have to leave you.

Hmm.

Mmm-hmm.

Now, I have convinced
our friends

at Singer Sewing Machines
to come back tomorrow

for "Here Comes Santa Claus."

I will see you in the morning,
Mr. Presley.

Oh, and as I recall,

Dr. King said
rock and roll music

contributed
to juvenile delinquency.

<i>It would be wrong,</i>

<i>it would be self-deceptive</i>

<i>to ignore the connection</i>

<i>between that lawlessness</i>
<i>and hatred</i>

<i>and this act of violence.</i>

<i>It would be just as wrong</i>

<i>and just as self-deceptive</i>
<i>to conclude from this act</i>

<i>that our country</i>
<i>itself is sick,</i>

<i>that it's lost its balance,</i>

<i>that it's lost its sense</i>
<i>of direction,</i>

<i>even its common decency.</i>

<i>200 million Americans</i>

<i>did not strike down</i>
<i>Robert Kennedy last night,</i>

<i>any more than they struck down</i>

<i>President John F. Kennedy</i>
<i>in 1963,</i>

<i>or Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>in April of this year.</i>

<i>My fellow citizens, we cannot,</i>

<i>we just must not tolerate</i>
<i>the sway</i>

<i>of violent men among us.</i>

<i>We must not permit men</i>
<i>that are filled with hate--</i>

<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

<i>Right down Santa Claus...</i>

We're pretty set for the number
tomorrow, right, E.P.?

<i>It's pretty familiar territory,</i>
<i>right?</i>

A reverend once told me...

"When things are too dangerous
to say...

sing."

<i>There must be lights</i>
<i>Burning brighter somewhere</i>

<i>Got to be birds</i>
<i>flying higher</i>

<i>In a sky more blue</i>

Standing by.
We're seconds away, folks.

We're just waiting on upstairs.

We're gonna get a rehearsal
going very shortly.

Let's go, let's go, people!
First positions!

Here we go, from the top.

Mrs. Presley is quite
the homemaker, Priscilla is,

and I'm sure
she would love to have

one of the SK551 machines
so she can knit Elvis's--

-They were in there all night.
-Doing what?

He's working on a new song.
He says he's singing it.

New song? Whoa, hey!

It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas. Yes!

Gentlemen, take your seats.

Now, that's
a winter wonderland.

Mr. Bindle.

You and I are
on the same page at last.

Bring up the lights
on the sign.

Okay, yeah. Let's go.

Dancers, stop.
Dancers, stop. Stop!

Turn about. Turn about.

You've got to get some roll.
I got action on the right side.

<i>Turn around. Come on,</i>
<i>through, through, through!</i>

<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

<i>With too much rain</i>

<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

<i>He can redeem</i>
<i>his soul and fly</i>

<i>Deep in my heart</i>
<i>There's a trembling question</i>

<i>Still, I am sure</i>
<i>That the answer's</i>

<i>Answer's gonna come</i>
<i>somehow</i>

<i>Out there in the dark</i>

<i>There's a beckoning candle,</i>
<i>yeah</i>

<i>And while I can think</i>
<i>While I can talk</i>

<i>While I can stand</i>
<i>While I can walk</i>

<i>While I can dream</i>

<i>Oh, please let my dream</i>

<i>Come true, oh</i>

<i>Right now</i>

<i>Let it come true right now</i>

<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

<i>I was always said,</i>
<i>when it came to music,</i>

<i>my boy knows best.</i>

<i>But the special was my idea.</i>
<i>It was a tremendous hit.</i>

<i>We was back on top.</i>

<i>But some people were</i>
<i>putting ideas into his head</i>

<i>that he didn't need me no more.</i>

Whoo-hoo!

<i>It's working.</i>

<i>London, Germany,</i>
<i>Japan...</i>

<i>Hulett here has got it</i>
<i>all lined up.</i>

Air Presley's new wings.

You know, when you
play stadiums, it's like...

you do a week of shows
in just one night.

And when it's done,
you get on the plane...

You go where you want,
you play where you want,

and if they don't like it,
you go someplace else.

You know who told me that?
B.B. King.

Well, B.B. knows, man.

And the someplace else
you should be going
is overseas.

I like that.

You know, I heard last year
alone, you had two offers.

Germany and Japan,

for a million bucks
for one night.

I mean, why the Colonel
would turn that down,

I have no idea, man.

Well, if you figure it out,
can you let us know?

Yeah.

Well, screw him.
You've got the plane now.

You should use it.

Yeah, come to Daddy.

Maybe we should call it
the "Lisa Marie."

That's a beautiful name.

Right?

Hit me. Hit me.

Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn
would like to see you.

Colonel Parker. Hit me.

I can't, sorry.

<i>You've run up</i>
<i>quite a tab, Colonel.</i>

And we hear your boy's working
with new people.

You've lost your meal ticket.

It's time to settle up,

before we have
to make things...

Uncomfortable.

Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

No passport, no residency.

You were never a colonel.
Never a Tom.

You weren't even a Parker.

Why did you flee Holland,
Andreas van Kuijk?

I don't know why

you can't just let
the lawyers take care of it.

I have to see him
in Vegas.

He's in the hospital.
It's the right thing to do.

-Yeah, well...
-He's frail right now.

You know what he's like, baby.

Hey! Watch it.

You know what he's like.
The second that
you're near him,

you'll be under ten feet
of snow before you know
what's happened.

My mind's made up.
Business is business.

He and I are done.

But I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

Well, just make sure he
doesn't clip your wings, honey.

He won't!

I am gonna go
see him in Vegas.

I'm gonna look him in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell him...

Watch my hair.
I'm gonna tell him...

-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

...it's over.

<i>You break it, you burn it</i>

<i>Drag it all around</i>

You twist it and turn it

<i>You cannot tear it down</i>

<i>'Cause every minute,</i>
<i>every hour you'll be shaken</i>

<i>By the strength</i>
<i>and mighty power of my love</i>

Colonel doesn't want you
making a fuss.

-Colonel?
-Mmm?

Elvis is here.

Oh...

Oh. My boy.

Admiral. How are you?

Oh, my boy, I should have
come down to see you.

But I'm a little
laid up, you know.

You've just
had a heart attack.

You're not meant
to get out of bed.

Heart attack?
Colonel, you said your back--

My heart just stopped is all,
and I fell. It's--

I put my back out.

There you go.

It was all the excitement about
the Christmas special, you see.

I should never have worried,

because you came through
like you always do.

Nobody can sell "show"
to an audience like you.

I admit it. I was wrong.

Colonel, I--

I wanted to tell you in person.

Um...

As far as business
is concerned...

I think we need to go
our separate ways.

Well, you may be right.

Maybe it is time for me
to retire.

Oh, come on, Colonel,
quit snowin' me.

You ain't retiring.

I will miss the circus. I will.

But I cannot keep up
with these young fellas,

like your Mr. Hulett,

who wants to put together
a new show

for an international tour,

for you to play stadiums.

These international tours
are very, very expensive.

And the costs
cut into the artist's profits.

I worry that the financial risk

would put a strain
on your daddy.

But I cannot help but think,

as your former
technical advisor

and as an old friend,
what if...

the next Elvis Presley show
did not cost you a red cent?

I wonder if your daddy would
not like the sound of that.

The brand-new
International Hotel.

It's a mighty big stage.

The biggest in Las Vegas.

You could get lost
in a place like this.

My boy, you performed
that comeback special

on a tiny square,
inside a studio,

and the fans loved it.

In a room this size,

you could give them
the greatest show on earth.

Nothing less
than Elvis Presley.

I've been experimenting
with a new, big sound.

Good. Good, my boy.

Because you can fill up
this entire stage

with every musical idea
that is inside that head.

No, it would cost.

Yes, that's the beauty of it.

You see, this here
International Hotel--

This International Hotel...

Mmm-hmm.

...needs a major drawing card

to pull in all the rubes
and put it on the map.

So they will cover
all of the costs

of putting together your show.

And you just play here
for six weeks,

and then off you go,

to tour around the world

with no financial risk
to Elvis Presley Enterprises.

None.

Well, goddamn.

Snowman strikes again.
Oh, yeah.

We're going to make it snow.
It will snow.

<i>First of all,</i>
<i>we're gonna need</i>
<i>the Sweet Inspirations.</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

<i>And the Imperials.</i>

<i>We're caught</i>
<i>in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>And a 30-piece orchestra.</i>

<i>You know,</i>
<i>the first thing</i>
<i>that I ever recorded,</i>

<i>the very first thing,</i>

<i>was an old, uh, rhythm</i>
<i>and blues-type song</i>

<i>called "That's All Right,</i>
<i>Little Mama."</i>

<i>And back then we only had</i>

<i>two or three instruments</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

<i>But this ain't</i>
<i>no nostalgia show.</i>

<i>We're gonna do something</i>
<i>different.</i>

I, uh...
I wanna try something new.

All right, Glen, you're gonna
start us off, okay?

Take the intro here.

All right, bring that
bass up, Jerry.

Keep playing.

Whoo!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

Boys...

<i>That's all right</i>

With me.

<i>Any way you do</i>

All right.

<i>James, you ready?</i>

Oh!

Flames, man!

Flames are coming
out of that guitar.

I got that. Ronnie.

I'll get back to that.

Horns, you ready?

<i>Ba-da-bom! Ba-da-bom!</i>

Let's up the octave!

Yeah! Goddamn!

All right, 'bones.
On a one, three, four...

Ronnie,
you know what to do, man.

Do it to me, come on.
Take us home.

Huh, huh, huh, huh
Hah! Hah! Hah!

Come on.
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

Colonel, nice to see you.
 -Oh, here you are.

Yeah. Here you go.

-How 'bout a hound dog?
-Cool.

I'll fix you with
some food and drink.

Thank you.

All right, let's go.

<i>Well, that's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Just any way you do</i>

<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do, yeah</i>

<i>Well, my mama,</i>
<i>she done told me</i>
<i>Papa told me too</i>

<i>"The life you're livin, son</i>
<i>Now, women be</i>
<i>the death of you"</i>

<i>Now, that's all right</i>

<i>That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

<i>That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right</i>

<i>Any way you do</i>

<i>Da, da-da, dee, dee, dee</i>
<i>Dee, dee, dee-dee</i>

<i>Dee, dee, dee-dee</i>
<i>Dee-dee, dee-dee, dee-dee, do</i>

<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

Ain't nobody gonna do
a better show than that.

I tell ya, if I was you,

I would book him
for a hundred years.

Well, no better time
than the present.

But we hear Hulett has him
doing a world tour.

Well, well, well, uh,
I think Mr. Presley

could be persuaded to make
the International his home,

provided he was paid
pretty well.

What did you have in mind?

I'd like to introduce to you
a couple of people tonight,

one of which being
my beautiful wife, Priscilla.

Would you stand up, honey?

For an attraction as tremendous
as Mr. Presley...

We love you,
Priscilla!

Also, this man over here,
I wouldn't be here without,

my manager of many years,
Colonel Sanders.

Parker. Parker.

Well, we're gonna do a new song
for you tonight.

It's called "Suspicious Minds."

"Suspicious Minds."

<i>We're caught in a trap</i>

<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

<i>Why can't you see</i>

<i>Oh, what you're doin' to me</i>

<i>Oh, when you don't believe</i>
<i>A word I'm sayin'?</i>

<i>We can't go on together</i>
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

<i>On suspicious minds</i>

<i>So, if an old friend I know</i>
<i>Shove it up your nose</i>

<i>Stops by to say hello</i>

<i>Would I still see suspicion</i>
<i>in your eyes?</i>

That is what my boy
would expect.

Now...

What are you going to pay me?

<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

Colonel, your sideshow
is the jackpot.

If you bring him back
every year,

I'll make it worth your while.

<i>Oh, I've never...</i>

<i>Lied to you</i>

<i>Caught in a trap</i>

<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>...good thing die</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Now, don't you know</i>

<i>Caught in a trap</i>

<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>Because I love you too much</i>

<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>Because I love you too much</i>

<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>Because I love you too much</i>

<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

<i>Oh, don't you know</i>
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

Of course, I will reserve
the right to sell calendars,

pictures and such?

You do whatever
you want, Colonel,

as long as that boy
stays on that stage.

<i>My boy's light</i>
<i>burned brighter</i>

<i>than even 15 years before.</i>

Hi, darlin'.

<i>I saw in her face</i>
<i>that night</i>

<i>what I had always known.</i>

<i>She could never compete</i>
<i>with the love he felt from you.</i>

I'm sorry I couldn't
make it up there, man.

<i>Take my... take my hand</i>

<i>Take my whole...</i>
<i>whole life too</i>

<i>For I... for I...</i>
<i>I can't help</i>

Hey, guys. Time to go back.

<i>Falling in love with you</i>

<i>Oh, oh, for I...</i>
<i>For I can't help</i>

<i>Falling in love</i>

<i>With you</i>

Thank you very much.

Thank you! Thank you.

Such a fine show.

Yeah, baby! Yeah.

Wow, great show.
Thank you. Thank you, all.

Goddamn, Elvis.
That was great.

That was fantastic.

There she is.

Oh, God. I don't know
who that was out there.

You were... You...

You were incredible.
You were...

You were everything.

Thank you, baby. Thank you.

Mr. Elvis Presley,

I guess that's your
new manager over there, hmm?

-Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to him,
all right?

-Okay.
-You okay to get upstairs?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

Tremendous...
tremendous triumph.

The greatest show on earth.

My dear boy, this brainchild
came from you and me,

but you alone
rose above it all,
and it worked with your talent,

and your dedication.

We did it. We did it!

We did it.
We did.

Come on.

I can't wait to show the world
what you and I can do.

The world will see this show.

Whatever it takes,
I guarantee it.

Whatever I have to do.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>of the press,</i>

the King of Rock and Roll,
Elvis Presley!

No, I'm not the king.

Hey, Fats. Mr. Fats Domino,
ladies and gentlemen.

This is the real king
of rock and roll.

Yeah, I'm somethin' else.

Any plans
to take this show on tour?

There's so many places
I haven't been yet, you know.

I'd like to go to Europe.
I'd like to go to Japan.

I've never been
out of the country,

<i>except in the service.</i>

What are you lookin' at
back there?

Oh, Mr. Diskin.

Have we discussed
with Mr. Hulett,

pertaining
to the death threats?

The death threats?

Precisely. Death threats!

<i>Down in Louisiana</i>

<i>Where the alligators</i>
<i>Grow so mean</i>

<i>Lived a girl that I swear</i>
<i>To the world</i>

<i>Made the alligators</i>
<i>look tame</i>

<i>Polk salad Annie</i>

<i>Colonel,</i>
<i>once we finish the season,</i>

<i>Elvis wants</i>
<i>to take the tour overseas.</i>

Overseas? Have you thought
about security, Jerry?

<i>Of course I have.</i>

<i>This is Elvis Presley,</i>

<i>the most famous man</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

<i>Straight-razor totin' woman</i>

<i>Lord, have mercy</i>

<i>The crazies</i>
<i>in those countries...</i>

They're a hundred times
more dangerous.

Am I the only one
who thinks about security?

<i>Sock a little polk salad</i>

<i>You know I need it</i>

There is nothing more important
than security!

Am I the only one who ever
thinks about Elvis' security!

Get him out of here!

<i>Those guys</i>
<i>turned out to be</i>

<i>some over-excited fans</i>
<i>from Peru.</i>

<i>But the death threats</i>
<i>were real.</i>

I'm going back on.

I'll rip his goddamn tongue out
by the roots.

<i>It started</i>
<i>to take its toll.</i>

Here at Baptist Memorial
Hospital in Midtown Memphis,

Elvis Presley has apparently
checked in to a private suite,

suffering from exhaustion.

A sign that Elvis
is in fact here

is the aluminum foil
that covers his windows
to deflect the sun.

<i>Shock around the nation today</i>

<i>as a free rock concert</i>
<i>at the Altamont Speedway</i>

<i>by English band</i>
<i>The Rolling Stones,</i>

<i>ended with four deaths.</i>

<i>One resulting from a stabbing,</i>
<i>allegedly committed...</i>

Elvis,
Dr. Nick is here.

Such a lovely girl,
Ms. Tate.

What has happened to law
and order in this country?

Hippies and radicals,

threatening and killing
popular entertainers.

The IRA blowing up England?
Planes exploding in mid-air?

Has the world gone mad?

Hulett's security
is not what it needs to be.

And he knows it.

An international tour now
is out of the question.

What are you talking about,
Colonel?

I ain't gonna let these sons of
bitches push me off the stage.

Precisely.

You are not one of Hulett's
long-hair Zeppelins,

you are Elvis Presley.

You are beloved.

And I told him I have to
look Priscilla in the eye,

and I have to promise her
that little Lisa Marie's daddy

will be safe while
he's away from home.

We're taking the show
to the world, Colonel.

I ain't gonna disappoint
those fans.

Well...

If you want to book more dates,
we could do an American tour,

15 cities in 15 days,

while Mr. Hulett
straightens out his security
problems overseas.

I'd like that
very much, son.

How is that gonna be any safer?

Because staying
in this country,

I can handle every aspect
of security.

And then we go international?

Yeah, sure, around the world.
Wherever you want.

But in the meantime,
here in America,

we put on a great show.

And what will we do, Charlie?

And have a lot of fun.

Taking care of business.

Taking care of business.

<i>I'll get guarantees</i>
<i>from every mayor.</i>

<i>We'll double</i>
<i>the police presence.</i>

<i>You'll have more security</i>
<i>than the President.</i>

<i>Lord Almighty</i>
<i>I feel my temperature rising</i>

<i>Higher, higher</i>
<i>It's burning through</i>
<i>to my soul</i>

<i>Girl, girl, girl</i>
<i>You're gonna set me on fire</i>

<i>My brain is flaming</i>
<i>I don't know which way to go</i>

<i>And when</i>
<i>the show is done,</i>

<i>the boys will hustle you</i>
<i>to the motorcade.</i>

Elvis has left the building.

<i>Once you're in the air,</i>
<i>Dr. Nick will ensure your rest.</i>

<i>Burnin' love</i>

<i>Land in the next city,</i>
<i>then we do it all again.</i>

<i>Fifteen times!</i>

<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

<i>It was life</i>
<i>on the road,</i>
<i>just like the old days.</i>

<i>We were making so much snow,</i>
<i>we did it again.</i>

<i>And again.</i>

<i>And again.</i>

<i>All in the safety</i>
<i>of the US of A.</i>

<i>Eventually, he lost interest</i>
<i>in going overseas.</i>

<i>Why would you?</i>

<i>But I still kept my promise.</i>
<i>I brought the world to him.</i>

<i>I invented the world's</i>
<i>first ever satellite concert.</i>

<i>1.5 billion people in</i>
<i>one night, for a single artist.</i>

<i>Nothing like it before,</i>
<i>nothing like it since.</i>

<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

<i>He was addicted to the love</i>
<i>he felt from you onstage.</i>

<i>Ordinary love</i>
<i>just didn't compare.</i>

<i>So, in the lonely moments</i>
<i>between shows,</i>

<i>he turned to them pills.</i>

Priscilla, I want you to
do something for me, will you?

You give my baby girl
a big hug for me, okay?

<i>The roar of the crowd.</i>

<i>The life on the road.</i>

<i>Calling home</i>
<i>to your loved ones,</i>
<i>pretending nothing has changed,</i>

<i>when everything has.</i>

<i>Lost.</i>

What was that?

Ain't no one
gonna walk around

sayin' they killed
Elvis Presley.

-What did you say?
-Nothing, baby.

<i>Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>has been shot</i>

<i>in downtown Memphis,</i>
<i>Tennessee...</i>

<i>Sharon Tate was the last</i>
<i>to die.</i>

Is that you, doll?

I'm leaving you,
and I'm taking Lisa with me.

Uh, 'Cilla, is this about
what happens on the road?

About the what?

Is this about what happens
on the road?

The girls? You think
I give a shit about the girls

that you sneak in
through the side door?

No. I couldn't care less
about whoever it is

you sneak through
the side door.

It's about this, Elvis.

-And this.
-Hey. Whoa.

And these goddamn pills
those leeches

and has-beens feed
down your throat!

God damn it.

-Like you're strung out.
-Strung out?

Goddamn, I'm in the best
shape of my life.

Best shape of your life.

The only time you're happy
is when you're on that stage.

And in between that,
you're a ghost.

'Cilla, I give you everything
you could want.

What I want is a husband.

I am your wife.
I am your wife!

And Lisa is your daughter.
She needs a father.

I am her father!

Do you remember the last time

that we laughed together?

Do you remember the last time
that the three of us

sat down and had
dinner together?

You won't even make love
to me anymore.

I gift you my life, and I have
nothing left in me to give you.

Do you still love me?

When you're 40 and I'm 50,
we'll be back together.

You'll see.

I have to go.

Will you please stay?

I have to go. Okay?
If I stay, I'll never leave.

-Please...
-You have to let me go.

-Please, Priscilla.
-You have to let me go.

<i>Fifty thousand</i>
<i>people gathered</i>

<i>in New Orleans earlier today</i>
<i>to mourn the passing</i>

<i>of gospel legend,</i>
<i>Mahalia Jackson.</i>

<i>Will you</i>
<i>come to Mississippi</i>

<i>and sing with us, Mr. Presley?</i>

Why, B.B. King will be there.
Perhaps even
the Rolling Stones.

<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.</i>

<i>The Colonel, he...</i>
<i>he won't allow it.</i>

<i>You are a man,</i>
<i>Mr. Presley.</i>

And a man don't
make up his own mind

about matters of conscience.

<i>Come on, Diskin.</i>
<i>Elvis needs a challenge</i>

<i>to get back on track.</i>

Why won't the Colonel
let him go overseas?

-Security, Jerry.
You know that.
-Bullshit!

The Colonel's killing
his greatest asset
without a reason.

So what is the reason?

Colonel always has his reasons.

<i>I'm not at liberty to divulge</i>

<i>personal information</i>
<i>about Mr. Parker.</i>

<i>He lied.</i>

There wasn't gonna be
an international tour

'cause he can't leave
the country.

He's got no citizenship,
no official identity.

He doesn't exist.

There never was
a Colonel Tom Parker.

What are you
talking about, Jerry?

Hey, whoa, whoa!

Get him
an ice bucket!

Colonel's a smart man.

There's got to be
another reason.

Come on, man!

I will
stay here at home,

and I will work
and I will worry.

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>why the Colonel</i>
<i>kept turning them down,</i>

I have no idea, man.

Get out of the way!

Now, you listen to me.
The only thing that matters...

is that that man
gets up on that stage tonight.

If he was my son,
I'd put him in a hospital.

Well, of course, this is
a Presley Enterprises decision.

Vernon?

Well... um...

Well, what can you...

What can you do for him,
Dr. Nick?

<i>His truth is marching on</i>

<i>His truth is marching on</i>

Thank you. Thank you.

Now he's gonna ask the house
lights to be brought up,

'cause we've been
looking at him.

He wants to look at us now.
He loves this.

I'd like to turn
the house lights up,

-ladies and gentlemen.
-Eh?

'Cause now that you've seen me,
I'd like to take a look at you.

Oh, you're beautiful.
Thank you.

He'll mention the VIPs
that are here.

We've got some high-rollers
in here tonight.

Get ready for the spotlight.

Mr. International Hotel
himself.

-Thank you.
-Ah, there you go.

And right next to him,

is my so-called manager,
Colonel Tom Parker.

There he is.
Come on.

But I hear rumors
that Colonel is an alien.

Got here on my rocket ship.

Oh.

Somebody call the FBI

and tell 'em that
he has abducted me,

that he has locked me
in this golden cage,

to keep me here forever
with you, ladies and gentlemen.

<i>So I'm caught in a trap</i>

<i>I can't get out</i>

'Cause Colonel's got some
big debts, baby.

Excuse me.

Well, this is the last show
I'm ever playing here.

I'm gonna get on my jet plane,
the Lisa Marie...

It's named after my, uh...
my beautiful daughter.

And I'm gonna fly away.

No, no, no...

You know, I'm gonna fly away.

Stop the show.
Stop this show!

Come on,
get this curtain down.

Fuck the International.

Mr. Schilling, what the devil
is happening here?

And Las Vegas.

That's what
he wants to know.

Ain't no one
gonna stop me, man.

Oh! Security.

Security!

Security, security! Security!

800 shows!

You don't have
a goddamn passport,
you son of a bitch!

You are fired!

You are fired!

You're fired!

You're fired.

E., I--

Colonel, I gotta--
I'll talk him down.

This is Colonel Tom Parker.
I wish it to be known

that Dr. Nick's services
are no longer required.

Thank you.

Hmm.

Well, Diskin...

if the boy wants to set out
on his own,

it's all right by me,
but Presley Enterprises

is going to cough up
what it owes.

-Are you ready?
-Ready.

Gasoline for the first trip
to the Hayride...

one dollar and 25 cents.

Un-recouped promotional costs

pertaining to souvenir
calendars, $100.

Collectible trading cards,
$100.

Posters, flyers and programs,
$100.

<i>Balloons, $50...</i>

What's the hold-up?

Sorry, E.P. Your daddy
won't come down.

Daddy.

What is this?

Well, that is what we owe
the Colonel.

We're broke.

Daddy, I've been playing this
mausoleum for a hundred years.

How could we be broke?

You spend
so much money.

You know, you got the cars
and the girls and the clothes,

and all the...
you know, new airplane.

Daddy, you are
my business manager.

You're supposed
to be taking care of business.

I don't know what to tell you,
son, we're broke!

We're plain broke.

Gotta take the Colonel back.

I am not taking him back.

We're gonna lose Graceland.

I am not taking him back!

He takes everything from me.

He takes 50%
of everything that I make!

And now he wants
to take the home

that we bought for Mama!

Listen to me, Daddy.

That old bastard
can sue if he wants,

but I am flying away.

With or without you.

Oh, you bloodsucking,
old vampire.

You bled me dry
and you still want more?

I'm not an uncaring man,
Mr. Presley.

Don't you "Mr. Presley" me,
you toad.

If you are so determined
to get out of our contract--

You're goddamn right
I want out.

Well, I will personally
loan you the money

that you owe
to Jamboree Attractions.

Yeah, you'll still have
your claws in me.

You'll still have me
working here

like a goddamn slave
in a salt mine,

you phony, no-good
piece of trash!

I oughta shoot you in your fat,
goddamn face!

Who are you?

I am you. And you are me.

Cut the horseshit!

Everything I've ever known
about you has been a lie.

E.P., you all good?

My past is the least
of your problems, my boy.

Everyone else
you associate with
lives from you, Mr. Presley.

Even Vernon.

That's right,
even your own daddy

has looked after himself
before he's looked after you.

Yes, I have lived
from you, too,
but the difference is

you have also lived from me.

We have supported each other.
Because we shared a dream.

We are the same, you and I.

We are two odd,
lonely children,
reaching for eternity.

Maybe you should fly away,
my boy.

Away from all of this.

But if you do choose
to leave...

then I, for one,
will be very lonely.

So would your father.

But I think you may
be lonely, too.

Oh, you see, my boy, the...

truth about
the Rock of Eternity...

It is forever
just beyond our reach.

<i>Do the chairs</i>
<i>in your parlor</i>

<i>Seem empty and bare?</i>

<i>Do you gaze</i>
<i>at your doorstep</i>

<i>Picture me there?</i>

<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

<i>Tell me, dear</i>

<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

<i>Tell me, dear</i>

<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

Son, I know...
I know, I...

I wanna try and...

I wanna try and fix this.
You know...

Daddy...

Tell that son of a bitch...

I want things to go back
to the way they were.

And, Daddy...

Tell the Colonel
to send up Dr. Nick.

<i>It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>in Las Vegas,</i>

<i>with lots going on</i>
<i>this weekend.</i>

<i>Those teen sensations,</i>
<i>The Jacksons,</i>

<i>are causing a lot of excitement</i>

<i>with their residency</i>
<i>at the MGM Grand.</i>

<i>And for the older crowd,</i>
<i>Elvis is back for a fifth year.</i>

<i>And don't we love him.</i>

<i>In Entertainment News today,</i>

<i>Elvis Presley is in talks to</i>
<i>play opposite Barbra Streisand</i>

<i>in a remake</i>
<i>of</i> A Star is Born.

<i>These days,</i>
<i>when he's not slurring</i>

<i>on stage in Vegas or playing</i>

<i>the same old</i>
<i>domestic concert circuit,</i>

<i>the singer spends weeks</i>
<i>at a time in his bedroom,</i>

<i>tormented by his</i>
<i>growing waistline.</i>

<i>Sounds like it won't be</i>
<i>much of a stretch for him</i>

<i>to play the role</i>
<i>of a washed-up singer.</i>

Oh, look, here they come.

Are you all right?
Yep.

All right, Daddy loves you.

Bye, baby.
Come on, baby.

-Bye, Papa.
-Good girl.

Bye, baby.
Give me your hand.

Hi!

Here she is.
Hi, baby. How you doing?

Want to say goodbye to Daddy?

Bye, Daddy.
You're so good.

Hi. How are you?
How you doing?

We're okay.

Hey.

Hi.

Hmm.

How are you doing?

Honey, there's this place
in San Diego

that you can go to rest.

To heal.

After the show, you can fly
directly and be in a clinic

before anyone knows.

It's all been arranged.

I'm gonna be 40 soon, 'Cilla.

Forty.

And nobody's gonna remember me.

I never did anything lasting.

I never made that classic film
that I could be proud of.

But what about <i>A Star is Born?</i>

Uh...

Barbra... the Colonel...

Please go.

For Lisa?

If you dream it,
you can do it, baby.

I'm all out of dreams.

Promise me.

I... will always... love you.

Hi, baby.

<i>Did you know</i>
<i>there's a kind of bird</i>

<i>that doesn't have any legs?</i>

<i>So it can't land on nothing.</i>

<i>It lives its whole life</i>
<i>on the wing.</i>

When it gets tired,
it just spreads its wings

and sleeps on the wind.

<i>If it ever does land,</i>
<i>even but one time...</i>

<i>so it dies.</i>

<i>Good evening.</i>

<i>Elvis Presley died today.</i>
<i>He was 42.</i>

<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>it was a heart attack.</i>

<i>He was found in his home</i>
<i>in Memphis...</i>

<i>President Carter</i>
<i>has just made a statement...</i>

<i>Elvis Presley's death</i>

<i>deprives our country</i>
<i>of a part of itself.</i>

<i>He was unique</i>
<i>and irreplaceable.</i>

<i>Thousands</i>
<i>of mourners have gathered</i>

<i>outside the gates</i>
<i>of Graceland...</i>

<i>Using the styles</i>
<i>of white country</i>

<i>and Black rhythm and blues,</i>

<i>permanently changed the face</i>
<i>of American popular culture.</i>

<i>The outpouring</i>
<i>of grief can be seen</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

<i>He was a symbol</i>
<i>to people the world over,</i>

<i>of the vitality,</i>
<i>rebelliousness...</i>

<i>What killed my boy?</i>

<i>Them doctors say</i>
<i>it was his heart.</i>

<i>Others, the pills.</i>

<i>Some say it was me.</i>

<i>No. I'll tell you</i>
<i>what killed him.</i>

<i>It was love.</i>

<i>His love for you.</i>

<i>You know, a few weeks</i>
<i>before he died,</i>

<i>I saw him sing</i>
<i>for the very last time.</i>

<i>He could barely stand up.</i>

"Unchained Melody."

From an album called
<i>Unchained Melody.</i>

Makes a lot of sense. Okay.

<i>But that night,</i>
<i>he sang as he always did.</i>

<i>With all his heart and soul.</i>

How you like it so far?

<i>That old voice</i>
<i>rang out,</i>

<i>and he sang with all his life.</i>

<i>Oh, my love</i>

<i>My darling</i>

<i>I've hungered</i>
<i>for your touch</i>

<i>A long, lonely time</i>

<i>Time goes by</i>

<i>So slowly</i>

<i>And time can do so much</i>

<i>Are you</i>

<i>Still mine?</i>

<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

<i>I need your love</i>

<i>God speed your love</i>

<i>To me</i>

<i>Lonely rivers flow to the sea</i>
<i>To the sea</i>

<i>To the open arms of the sea</i>

<i>Lonely rivers cry</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>

<i>I'll be coming home</i>

<i>Wait for me</i>

<i>My love, my darling</i>

<i>I've hungered for your kiss</i>

<i>A long, lonely time</i>

<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>I was a dreamer.</i>
<i>I read comic books</i>

<i>and I was the hero</i>
<i>of the comic book.</i>

<i>I saw movies and I was</i>
<i>the hero in the movie.</i>

<i>So every dream</i>
<i>that I ever dreamed</i>

has come true
a hundred times.

<i>Are you still mine?</i>

<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

I learned very early
in life that...

"Without a song,
the day would never end,

without a song,
a man ain't got a friend,

without a song,
the road would never bend,

without a song."

So I keep singing a song.

<i>To...</i>

<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

<i>Ooh</i>

<i>Me</i>

<i>Elvis has left the building.</i>

<i>As the snow flies</i>

<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

<i>A poor little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

<i>In the ghetto</i>

<i>And his mama cries</i>

<i>'Cause if there's one thing</i>
<i>that she don't need</i>

<i>Is another hungry mouth</i>
<i>to feed</i>

<i>In the ghetto</i>

<i>People, don't you understand</i>

<i>The child needs a helping hand</i>

<i>Or he'll grow to be</i>
<i>an angry young man some day</i>

<i>Take a look at you and me</i>

<i>Are we too blind to see?</i>

<i>Do we simply turn our heads</i>
<i>And look the other way</i>

<i>Well, the world turns...</i>

<i>"You never</i>
<i>stood in that man's shoes</i>

<i>Or saw things through his eyes</i>

<i>Or stood and watched</i>
<i>with helpless hands</i>

<i>While the heart inside you dies</i>

<i>So help your brother</i>
<i>along the way</i>

<i>No matter where he starts</i>

<i>For the same God that made you</i>
<i>Made him, too</i>

<i>These men with broken hearts"</i>

<i>And his mama cries</i>

<i>And a hungry, little boy</i>
<i>with a runny nose</i>

<i>Plays in the street</i>
<i>as the cold wind blows</i>

<i>In the ghetto</i>

<i>And his hunger burns</i>

<i>So he starts to roam</i>
<i>the streets at night</i>

<i>And he learns how to steal</i>
<i>And he learns how to fight</i>

<i>In the ghetto</i>

<i>Then one night in desperation</i>
<i>The young man breaks away</i>

<i>He buys a gun, steals a car</i>

<i>Tries to run,</i>
<i>but he don't get far</i>

<i>And his mama cries</i>

<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

<i>Another little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

<i>In the ghetto</i>

<i>And his mama cries</i>

<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

<i>That was what she gave to me</i>

<i>Never thought</i>
<i>I'd travel all alone</i>

<i>The trail of memories</i>

<i>Don't tiptoe, stomp my ground</i>

<i>Gotta let 'em know</i>
<i>we're comin'</i>

<i>Just stay there, woman</i>

<i>Engine still runnin'</i>

<i>Get dressed</i>
<i>Like the whole world watchin'</i>

<i>God bless</i>
<i>Gotta leave 'em shooken</i>

<i>Girls goin' wild, too cray</i>

<i>Look at what you made</i>

<i>Always come correct</i>
<i>There's no turnin' back</i>

<i>Takin' bigger steps</i>

<i>That's all I can do</i>

<i>That's all for the moment</i>
<i>If that's all right with you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>That's all right with you</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>Anyway you do, that's all right</i>

<i>That's all right</i>

<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

<i>We can't go on together</i>

<i>With suspicious minds</i>

<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

<i>On suspicious minds</i>

<i>There must be peace</i>
<i>and understanding sometime</i>

<i>Strong winds of promise</i>

<i>That will blow away</i>
<i>the doubt and fear</i>

<i>If I can dream of a warmer sun</i>

<i>Where hope keeps shining</i>
<i>on everyone</i>

<i>Tell me why, oh, why,</i>

<i>Oh, why won't that sun appear</i>

<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

<i>With too much rain</i>

<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

<i>He can redeem his soul and fly</i>

<i>Oh...</i>

<i>Deep in my heart,</i>
<i>there's a trembling question</i>

<i>Still I am sure</i>
<i>that the answers</i>

<i>The answers gonna come somehow</i>

<i>Out there in the dark,</i>
<i>there's a beckoning candle</i>

<i>And while I can think,</i>
<i>while I can talk</i>

<i>While I can stand,</i>
<i>while I can walk</i>

<i>While I can dream</i>

<i>Please let my dream</i>

<i>Come true</i>

<i>Right now</i>

<i>Let it come true right now</i>

<i>Oh, yeah</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>You're fantastic.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
