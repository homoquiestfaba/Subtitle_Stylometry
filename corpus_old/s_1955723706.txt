<i>LEO: Dear man in prison,</i>

<i>my name is Leopold Bloom,</i>

<i>and my life began long before I was born.</i>

<i>Mother said I was the seal of her sin,</i>

<i>and my aunt just said I was
a quiet little man who spoke with my eyes.</i>

GIL: You just gonna stand there?

I know they've given you the whole spiel
and all about staying clean,

but for every two of you I take out,
I take one back in.

No, there ain't nothing worse for me
than going back on this road.

You won't be going back
on this road with me.

Yeah?

That's what each of you says.

You just do your work,

stay clean, and do what Vic says.

GIL: Don't you have anything to say?

You're a free man now.

Ever get tired of the name
people call you by?

What? Gil?
Mmm-hmm.

No.

Been called Gil my whole life.

My place has simple rules,

which I expect you to honour 24/7,
no matter what.

You're to be on time,

which means that your uniform is on
when your shift begins.

Don't argue with me,

and don't ever even think about
stealing from me,

because I will find you
and send you back to where you come from.

Now, you get two breaks a day

and a Bible for them.

I expect you to read that.

If you're sick,
you'd better be bleeding to death.

And let's get something straight.

I hire you 'cause you're cheap.

It ain't charity, it's business.

You're gonna be living under my eyes now,
and believe me, they see everything.

Caroline!

Caroline, get Gil
some shepherd's pie, would you?

GIL: You're not still serving that, are you?
Oh, yeah.

Best recipe in the land. Here.
Shit.

Is he mute or something?

No. He just don't say all that much.

How long has he been in for?
Fifteen years.

Murder?
Mmm-hmm.

Swell.

Well, it looks to me like we're running
a fucking charity over here.

Why don't we just get them
a bunch of whores

and give them a goddamn vacation,
all these fucking maggots?

Now, that's an idea.
GIL: Yeah.

There you go, bud.
Thanks, Caroline.

You don't look like no murderer.

What you call yourself?

Stephen.

Well, this here ain't much,

but it's yours.

Thanks.

I'm Louis.

My room is just down there. Next to Vic's.

<i>WOMAN 1 ON RADIO:
You need to be together.</i>

<i>You need to create some special time.</i>

<i>Maybe you do something
that you want to do together.</i>

<i>Go to the park, maybe go to the movies,
whatever it is,</i>

<i>- but spend some time talking to each other.
WOMAN 2: Yeah.</i>

<i>WOMAN 1: If you're gonna stay together
for the sake of the kids,</i>

<i>then truly this can be worked out.</i>

(GLASS BREAKING)

(ISABELLE CRYING)

Isabelle?

Honey, what did you do?

It's okay, it's okay.
Everything all right?

Yeah, it's fine.

Here, I'll take her if you wanna
get something to clean that up with.

Oh...

RYAN: Hello.
Thank you.

Oh, she's a pretty one.

A natural heartbreaker, just like her mama.

Yes, you are.
I'll be right back.

RYAN: No hurry.

Natural heartbreaker.

I'll see you all tomorrow.

Bye.
Take care.

BEN: Rose, huh?

What?
You picked rose for Izzy's room.

Yeah.

I like it.
Good.

The English department is
having their faculty party this Friday.

I know.

Is that all right with you?
It always is.

It's not that bad.

I never said it was.

Hey, Mary!
Hi.

RUTH: Look at this sweet little girl.

Hi there.

Well, Mary, we missed you
the other night at Theresa's.

Well, everybody was wondering
why you and Ben didn't show up.

Well, you're not gonna be able to avoid
those dinners

once Ben's head of the department.

What did you get?

Well, Susan had
some lovely blouses on sale.

Yes, well, summer's just around the corner,
and that's all the excuse I need.

Besides, everything I have is just so old.

I know the feeling.

Well, Mary,
you and I should go shopping sometime.

I'd like that.

I'm really looking forward to spending
more time with the two of you.

Oh...

Well, tell Ben we said hello.
Yes.

I will, I will.

Good to see you.
Good to see you. Bye.

Bye.

It's starting to look nice.

Yeah, well, it didn't really look
too bad before.

Yeah.

Are you gonna share that with me?
Yes, I brought it for you.

That's a nice lady.

Thank you.

How's your book?
What?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I noticed you were
reading it all morning in the kitchen.

You're like a big reader.

Yeah. Well, when Isabelle's quiet
I have to take advantage.

Are you a... You a professor, too?

No. No.

How come you said it like that?

Well, I was going to be, but I...

I started graduate school, and then
it didn't really work out the way I'd hoped.

How come?

Someone had to decide
the colour of the nursery.

Yeah. Well, that's too bad.
You could have trusted me with that.

I got fine taste.
I'm sure you do.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello.
Hey, old friend, it's me.

<i>Hey! Been hoping I'd hear from you.</i>

I know you didn't want me
to come down there to see you,

but I heard everything went smoothly.

It's just like you to keep tabs on me.

<i>When can I come and see you?</i>

Not yet, but soon.

Listen, Tom, you've been getting
all my packages, right?

Yeah, of course.

I've been meaning to ask you
what you wanted me to do with them.

Just hold on to them.

<i>I read what was inside.</i>

Yeah, well, I figured you would.
I think other people should read them.

They're pretty damn good.

<i>I think publishers should see these,
they're really...</i>

They're not finished yet.
I'm still writing the last book.

The series won't make sense without it.

Oh, yeah? Why's that?
What happens in the last book?

It ends.

Fair enough.

<i>- Hey, Tom?</i>
Yeah.

Thanks.

Hey, how're you doing?

I seen you dropped off by the state limo.

I hope you enjoyed the ride.

(HORACE LAUGHING)

Just so you know,

we keep up the same kind of standards
over here.

Can I get me one of them triple, non-fat,

medium lattes with the foam on the top
and that chocolate sugar.

Hey, now. You know that
I'm against the coffee franchise

as much as anybody else.

'Cause I like exactly what we got here.

What do you think, Caroline? Hmm?

Think I can get me some?

JACK: Make that two.

(JACK BURPS)

Hold the cream.

I'm gonna be up all night tonight,

so let's make it black.

Hey, pick a number between one and 20.

Why?

PowerPick.

Twelve.

My lucky number.

You're not scared of Horace, huh?
No.

Not as much as he is of himself.

Why is he here all the time?
Well, it's kind of his place.

He sort of bought into it
back when we got into some trouble, so...

You know.

This is Horace's place?

Sure is. Comes in every day
and drinks himself into believing

he's got a claim on this place
and everything in it.

HORACE: Where's Caroline?

Well, I'd better get back in there.

Here. He's gonna be needing more coffee.

<i>STEPHEN: Stories never begin
where you think they do,</i>

<i>neither do lives.</i>

<i>Behind each tale and the person
who may or may not have lived it</i>

<i>is a history.</i>

<i>And just as the word for history holds story,</i>

<i>so, too, does the thing itself.</i>

<i>And your history, young friend,</i>

<i>really is a nightmare
from which you are trying to awake.</i>

<i>Here's to that awakening or escape.</i>

(DOORBELL RINGING)

MARY: Just a second. I'll be right there.

Hi, Mary.
Hi, Ruth.

I just made some custard.
I thought I'd drop some off.

Thank you.

Oh, my! How little Isabelle is blooming.

MARY: Can I get you a drink?

I'd love an iced tea.
My God, it is hot out there.

Make yourself at home.
Okay.

Are you having work done on the house?
Yeah, mainly Isabelle's room.

Thanks.

You look great.
Thank you. So do you.

Thanks.
How's Paul?

Fine, fine. We'll try and get away
at the end of the month.

Mmm-hmm. That's good.
Mmm-hmm.

(RUTH LAUGHS)

Isn't this precious!

How's Ben?

He's fine.
He works all of the time, but he's fine.

Well...

They sure are committed to their students.
I'm gonna tell you that.

I know. Ben's got them calling
all hours of the night.

Yes.

And how are you, Mary?

I'm fine.

It's okay if you don't wanna talk about it.

Talk about what?

Oh. Nothing. No, no, nothing.

Talking never seemed
to be such a challenge for you.

I'm sorry, Mary.

Joanne told me she was sure you knew.

Knew what?

Well, Paul's been seeing Ben
with one of his students.

Carrying on.

But, really,
I suppose they just could be working

during all that time they spend together.

I'm so embarrassed, Mary.
This really isn't any of my business.

No, it's not any of your business.

I'm sure there must be some kind
of explanation, though.

Yes, I must be mistaken.

It doesn't sound like Ben.
No. No, I don't think so.

Well, I should get going.

Okay. I will see you.
Bye. Bye.

GIRL: Do not say a word.

Mary. Hi.

It's good to see you.
Diane! It's good to see you.

Ben told me that you're teaching this term.
Yeah, I am.

That's so good.

So, how are things with you?
They're good.

How old is your daughter now?
She's two.

That's a great age.

Or is it?

I wouldn't even know.

It's fine. It's not really an age yet,
but it's great. It's fine.

It's good to see you, Mary.
It's really good to see you.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

I don't know, but I'll deal with it tomorrow.
I will. I promise.

Why do you feel the need
to call me at home?

<i>STEPHEN: This is finally my own story,
the story of now.</i>

<i>And I think it's fitting
that I'm telling it to you,</i>

<i>for, in the end, you will find my beginning</i>

<i>and maybe even your own.</i>

<i>Everything you've ever done
adds up to everything you'll ever do.</i>

<i>That's just the way it goes.</i>


Goddamn son of a bitch!


RYAN: Mrs Bloom.

Mrs Bloom!
Yes!

Is everything okay?
It's fine!

You sure about that?
I am sure about that.

If you're so sure, why are you knocking
books off the shelves?

Hey! Hey!
'Cause it feels good.

Hey, come on, come on.
Calm down, calm down.

No! Let go!

I'll let go when you calm down.

Whatever's happened,
you don't deserve to be feeling like this.

I don't deserve this.
Neither do your books.

(ISABELLE CRYING)

I'll let go if you... If you calm down.

Do you want me to go get her?

Okay, I'm gonna put you back down,
all right?

I'm sorry about...

I'm sorry you had to be here
to watch me attack the bookcase.

That's no big deal.
I've never done anything like that before.

Shit, I throw shit all the time.

It feels good to hit things.
I know.


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's all right.

MARY: (CRYING)
I never wanted to come here.

Where you wanna be?
I never wanted to come here.

Oh, God!
Come here.

RYAN: It's all right.

It's okay.

(MARY MOANING)

(MARY MOANING)


What the hell are you trying to do,
startle me to death?

Where were you?
I was at work.

Where else would I have been?

I don't know, Ben.
Where would you have been?

Have you been drinking?

Ruth Livingston stopped by the other day.

She told me all about you
and whatever the hell her name is.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about the girl you're fucking.


You're not serious, are you, Mary?

Oh, my God! You actually are.

Mary, I swear there's nothing going on.

I'm supposed to believe that?
Yes, you are.

Paul saw you.
He saw you, you son of a bitch!

Is Isabelle asleep?
Yes, she's asleep.

Did you forget what kind of a mother I am?
Then get up!

I said get up.

Get out of the car, Mary.
Get out of the damn car.

Get out!

Ben.

Evening, Paul.

Mary.

What's going on?

I'm here to see Ruth.

Is everything all right?
No. No, it's not.

Ruth! Ruth, come on down here.

Hello, Ben. How are you?

Ruth, did you tell my wife
I was cheating on her?

No.

BEN: Ruth.

Yes, but...
BEN: You lied, Ruth.

Is that what you wanted to do?

What did you say to her, Ruth?
Nothing.

BEN: Yes, yes, you did.

You've got shame written all over your face.

Paul, I'm sorry we woke you.

It's okay. You just lost faith in me, that's all.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.
It's not okay.


(MAN EXCLAIMING)

(DOOR SLAMMING)

BEN: How's he doing?

MARY: He!

It's bad luck to wish for one over the other.

I'm not wishing for one over the other.
I'll be happy if he's a girl, too.

What?

I've been offered a teaching fellowship
in London for a year,

before they make me
head of the department.

Wow, that's great. When?

This winter.

What do you think?

I think you should go.

When we get back, you can finish your PhD.

You really want me to do that?

I never didn't want you to do that.

This is going to feel much better.
There you go.

What's wrong?
She has a really bad sunburn.

Here, I'll put some cold cream on her.
Where is it?

We don't have any.
We don't have any cold cream?

No, we don't have any cold cream.

I'm supposed to have everything here
just in case we may need it?

Okay, all right. I'll go get some.
I'm sorry. I'm just tired. The baby...

Could you take Izzy with you?
Sure.

Okay, the drive will be good for her.

Come on, pumpkin. Okay.

See you in a bit.
Okay.

MARY: Thank you.

BEN: M-I...
ISABELLE: M-I...

...S-S-I...
...S-S-I...

...S-S-I...

...S-S-I...

...P-P-I.
...P-P-I.

Mississippi.
Mississippi.

M-I...
M-I...

...S-S-I...
...S-S-I...

...S-S-I.

(HORN BLARING)

Yes?

Mrs Bloom?

What?

There's been an accident.

Your husband and your daughter.

They didn't make it.
No.

No, there must be some mistake.
They just went...

They just went...

No!

Mrs Bloom.

(MOANING SOFTLY)

Hey.

Hey, sis. You're up.

What happened to the baby?

You had a... You had a little boy.

He didn't come out right, did he?

He did, he...

Well, his lungs weren't fully formed yet,

so the doctors are helping him.
He's gonna be fine.

I did this.

I did this to them. I did this to them.

It was an accident.

That baby's a sign of what I did.

Nothing you could have done
made this happen. I mean...

There are no reasons
when something like this happens.

There are reasons for everything.

He's a... He's a beautiful little boy.

He has the tiniest little hands.

I don't want to see him.

I don't want to see him.
I don't want to see him.

<i>STEPHEN: Before you can write some things,
you have to live them.</i>

<i>To you, young friend,</i>

<i>I would like to be able to write of something
dignified that I did, heroic even.</i>

<i>As that may never happen,
I'll be satisfied if I can save just one person</i>

<i>in the way you've helped to save me.</i>

<i>There is a woman here
who reminds me of someone</i>

<i>I forever desperately wanted to save.</i>

<i>If I can help her,</i>

<i>I know I can say goodbye
to what came before once and finally.</i>

<i>And then I may finish my books</i>

<i>by writing of a time less plagued
by the pains of the past.</i>

<i>In the meanwhile, you remain with me,
helping me as you always have.</i>

BRYNNE: Look, I know
you don't want to deal with this now,

but you're going to have to name him.

Maybe you should just see him.

I'll call him Leopold.

Leopold Bloom.

<i>MINISTER: Our thoughts and our prayers</i>

are going to be with those
who Ben and Isabelle left behind.

What we have left is a family.

<i>- BRYNNE: I know that name from somewhere.</i>
For in their death there was a birth.

<i>- Who is he?</i>
May we hope and pray that this boy

grows up to be the great man
his father was...

<i>MARY: He's a man in a book
I read a long time ago.</i>

...and loves and cares for his mother

as she undoubtedly will for him.
<i>- BRYNNE: I like that.</i>

<i>- Mom and Dad would have liked that.</i>
God bless their souls,

<i>- and God help them bear the days ahead.</i>
Leopold Bloom.

(HORACE LAUGHING)

HORACE: Don't blame the car
if you can't drive, Jack. God damn it!

Ain't this a fine fucking sight?

Where's Caroline?

I want my food.

I'll get it for you.

I don't want you getting my fucking food.
That's Caroline's job.

You hear me, you piece of shit?

(HORACE CHUCKLES)

I don't even know
why the fuck you're talking to me.

JACK: Horace, ask him.

Ask him.
Oh, yeah.

Right.

When you were in the house,
were you a pitcher or a catcher?

(JACK LAUGHING)

You know, did you take it,
or did you give it?

Why you want to know?

'Cause we like to know if we've got
some bitches running around amongst us.

Oh, I'd say you do.

I don't fucking like you.

I don't like one goddamn thing about you.

I look at you and I see
a thousand different ways I can end you.

And I don't even need a reason.

Now, you just keep talking.
You just keep it up.

Now, get out of my way,
you scrawny little fucking weed.

Horace.
I want Caroline.

Horace.
Hey, Vic. How you doing?

What you need is
some fresh shepherd's pie.

HORACE: Excellent.

Stephen, did you read that Bible I gave you?

Yes, sir.

Well, then, you know who
the greatest shepherd of all was, don't you?

Jesus himself.

You know, the thing I love
about shepherd's pie

is that it's not only delicious,

but it's a pious meal.

Well, I like to add a little sin to it.

You know, sin makes everything interesting,
don't you think?

Goddamn reckon it does.

Give me a little of that sin. Damn right I do.

Gonna put a lot on Jack's.
Hey, hey, hey, Horace, God damn it!

HORACE: Listen, you gonna keep that boy
around here?

Prison boy. You put some gloves on him
if he's going to be handling food.

MARY: Leo, what's wrong?

Why aren't you eating your food?
'Cause I don't like raisins.

Well, I don't care. I want you to eat it.

Don't you dare cry. You hear me?

You know, your sister cried for hours
the night she died.

If she cried that much
when she had a sunburn,

I wonder how much she cried when...

I still hear her crying every night.

You know, Leo,
when you were little and you'd cry,

I'd still hear her.

I don't think I've ever heard you cry.

Your mother never heard you cry.

Eat your food.

Where's the boy?

He's asleep.

Come on.

Come on, you want some. Come on.
Ryan, it's really late.

I'm just...

I'm just not up for your shit tonight.
Come on. Come on.

I want you to leave.
Don't you ever fucking tell me to leave.

Don't fucking tell me to leave. You got that?

Fucking leave!
Don't you ever fucking tell me to leave.

What's your fucking problem?
Come on. You're such a big boy.

I am a big boy. You shut the fuck up.
Come on. Come on.

Come on.
You fucking bitch.

I said get out of here!
Who do you think you're telling to leave?

What part of it is not clear?
Are you turning me away?

I will tell you when to leave, you mother...

I am not asking you to leave,
I am telling you to leave.

(MARY AND RYAN ARGUING)

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?
<i>- BRYNNE: Is this the birthday boy?</i>

Hi, Aunt Brynne.

Hi, how you doing down there?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

<i>- How's school?</i>
It's okay.

Is your mom doing anything special
for you today?

No, not yet.

<i>Is... Is your mom around?</i>

LEO: She's asleep.

It's the middle of the day.

Yeah. She didn't sleep so well last night.

Well, just tell her I called, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

<i>- And see you this weekend.</i>
Thanks.

All right,
we are going to write some letters today.

Now, they have to be honest,
and they have to be interesting, and...

CHARLES:
Who are we supposed to write them to?

Whoever you want.

People who you think
might want to read them.

Well, how long do they have to be?

An hour long, which translates
to at least a paragraph from each of you.

Mr Jenkins, can we be mean
so long as we're being honest?

No. Now, shut up, Charles.

All right, let's get started.

<i>LEO: Dear man in prison,</i>

<i>my name is Leopold Bloom,</i>

<i>and my life began long before I was born.</i>

<i>Mother said I was the seal of her sin,</i>

<i>and my aunt just said I was
a quiet little man who spoke with my eyes.</i>

Take time with your words, Leo.

<i>I live alone with my mother, Mary,
in Oxford, Mississippi.</i>

<i>My father and my sister died
the day I was born.</i>

<i>There's not much else to tell you
about myself, I guess.</i>

<i>I don't exactly know who you are,
but I think I know how you must feel.</i>

<i>I don't really have any friends,
and I don't know where to go to find them.</i>

<i>I guess we both feel like we can't get out</i>

<i>or maybe wonder
what it's like on the other side.</i>

<i>In either case,
most people are uncomfortable with me,</i>

<i>but not as much as
because of something I did,</i>

<i>as much of because of how I am.</i>

<i>At least, in your case, you know
what you did that got you locked up.</i>

<i>I guess knowing that we will never meet
makes it easy to write to you.</i>

<i>If you want, you can write me back.</i>

<i>My best wishes for a quick end
to your time there or a good escape.</i>

<i>It was nice talking to you.
Sincerely, Leopold Bloom.</i>

Hi, Mom.

Hey.

Don't you have any friends
you can play with, Leo?

Can't you find some?

You shouldn't smoke, Mom.

We just learnt at school
how bad it is for you.

It's bad for me?

It could kill you if you do it too much.

Why don't you let me decide
what's bad for me?

Did they tell you how bad it is for a woman
to smoke when she's pregnant?

I think I smoked
when I was pregnant with you.

(LEO WHEEZING)

Maybe that's why you can't run
without running out of air.

(DOOR OPENING)

Mrs Bloom.

I'm Mr Jenkins, Leo's teacher.
Yes, I know that.

Is there something wrong?
No, nothing's wrong.

I just really need to talk to you about Leo.
What would you like to talk about?

Well, I really would like to enrol him
at Ole Miss,

in some classes this summer.

His level of reading and writing is
beyond any of his other classmates,

and, quite frankly,
our school's curriculum just doesn't...

I told you I don't want him at the university.

I know.
I don't feel that it would be better for him.

I know, and I respect that,
but I think it would be.

I know it wouldn't be.
How would you know that

before I've even told you
our course of study?

Mrs Bloom.

I can't pretend to understand the level
of suffering and loss, but...

Then don't.

I hate to be rude. I was just in the middle
of something in the kitchen and...

Appreciate you stopping by.

I know, but Leo, he...

<i>LEO: "I take Mary there
to try to calm her and myself.</i>

<i>"I don't know what it does except
manage to put us on the same bank,</i>

<i>"the same side of things for a while.</i>

<i>"It was right about the river
being a strong brown God,</i>

<i>"but those sullen untamed waters don't just
remind us of what we want to forget.</i>

<i>"Sometimes, they make us
forget those things</i>

<i>"we wish we didn't have to remember."</i>

MARY: Leo, you're gonna go blind
one of these days.

What? Another one
of your silent treatments?

All right, don't talk to me.

It's okay.

<i>STEPHEN: Dear kid, I got your letter,</i>

<i>and I don't just mean
that I received it, either.</i>

<i>I mean I understood it.</i>

<i>I'm writing back
because it would have meant something</i>

<i>for someone to write to me
when I was your age.</i>

<i>I thought I'd tell you a few truths
right off the bat.</i>

<i>Your mother loves you,</i>

<i>even if it's only in some part of herself
that she never shares with you.</i>

<i>If people are uncomfortable with you,
then forgive them.</i>

<i>It's probably because they're uncomfortable
with themselves.</i>

<i>And even if you never knew
your father or your sister,</i>

<i>it's okay for you to think of them
and miss them.</i>

<i>Keep writing, kid,
and I don't just mean to me.</i>

<i>Best regards. Stephen.</i>

Do you hate me, Leo?

No, I don't.

You should.

Do you know who I named you after?

No.

A character in a book called <i>Ulysses.</i>

I read it in college.

He reminded me of everything I was,

everything I never wanted to be.

Can I read the book?

Well, you've read every goddamn book
in the house.

You'll regret that later.


What the hell are you looking at, Leo?

I'm just wondering why you never talk to me
when you come over.

Well, what do you want to talk about?

You pick a topic.

Well, we don't have a lot in common,

unless you want to talk about painting.

'Cause I paint pretty much every day,

and I don't think that interests you much,
does it?

Sure.

Let's talk about painting.

What do you like about painting, Ryan?


To be honest with you,
not a whole fucking lot.

Next topic.
What do you like?

I'm tired, Leo. I'm fucking tired.

Do you like my mom?

You got a lot of balls
asking all these questions, Leo.

Yeah.

Well, one should know these things.

So, do you like my mom or not?

Sure I do.

I like her a whole lot.

LOUIS: Vic put that up there about...
About five years ago.

Did that the day after he thought
he found Jesus.

In the stock room.
The stock room?


LOUIS: Hey, Stephen.

There's been something on my mind,
something kind of eating on me.

STEPHEN: What's that?

LOUIS: Last few weeks,
I've been seeing the lights on in your room.

All night, and I mean all night.

And you, you just been
sitting there, writing.

I mean, writing like a preacher
working on a Sunday sermon.

Man, what are you working on?

A book, letters, but mostly letters.

I've been writing letters to a boy
who wrote me when I was in prison.

A boy?
Mmm-hmm.

LOUIS: Well, how's that working out for you?

He's like me before I went to prison,

and I want things
to end up differently for him.

So I write stories to him,
and it helps me, too.

'Cause, you know, some days,

shepherd's pie, as good as it is,
doesn't cut it.

Man, you're learning, man. You're learning.

LOUIS: Hey, Stephen.

Did you know that kid
before you went to prison?

No. It started when I was in there.

You ever see the kid?

No.

But I'm fixing to.

Soon.

I believe you will, Stephen.

Yes, I believe you will.

(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

KID 1: Come on, Mark.
KID 2: Batter, swing!

Hey.

Hey.

You allowed to play?

Yeah.

What position do you want?

I want to be catcher.
Catcher?

Why do you want to play that?

You don't run, and you've gotta sit
on your knees the whole time.

That's fine by me. I'm sick of being catcher.

Let him do it.

(KIDS CHEERING)

MARK: All right, Bloom!

KID 1: Come on, Leo!

Come on, Leo! Come on, Leo!

Come on, Leo! Come on, Leo!

Come on, Leo!

KID 2: Go to it, Leo!

KID 1: Go on, Leo!

KID 2: He clobbered it!

KID 3: Go on, Leo! Go on! You can do it!

Run! Run!

Go on, Leo. Run!

KID 1: Leo!

KID 1: Yeah, all right, Leo!

Nice job, Leo.

KID 1: All right.
KID 2: Well done, Leo.

All right! That was an awesome hit!
Great hit!

Leo!
KID 4: Well done, Leo.

MARY: Come on. It's time to come inside.

That was great.

See you, Leo.
See you soon.

Rise and shine!

Wake up!

Wake up! Wake the fuck up!

I'm a low-down dirty dog.

Wake up!

You wake the fuck up! Do you hear me?

Get up!

Open the fucking door!

Mary.

Open the fucking door.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Come on out here, baby. Open the door!

What's a guy gotta do
to get laid around here?

How's this for a fucking charge?

Shit.

I'll be back.

You're gonna pay me.

(ENGINE STARTING)

(HORACE SHOUTING)


(HORACE AND CAROLINE SHOUTING)


You keep them open. Keep them open.

Who do you owe?
I know.

Who do you owe?
I owe you.

Okay.
I know I owe you.

You owe me big time, bitch.

You like that?
Yes, I like that.

You like that, don't you?
Yeah.

Spread! Okay, you just keep them open,
keep them open.

Hey.

What's going on?

Absolutely nothing.


Who owns this egg?
It's my egg, like you're my egg.

Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?

Yeah, you just sit there.

There! Now look at you, huh? Look at you!

STEPHEN: Where's Vic?

Louis, where's Vic?
I haven't seen him in a couple of days.

There's blinds drawn.

Doesn't he get hungry in there?
JACK: Not where he goes.

HORACE: Keep them open!
Where's Caroline?

Look at that, skimming tips from me.
"I owe you."

Didn't I tell you to keep your legs open?

Where is she?

HORACE: Keep them open!

Stephen, leave it be. Stay on that side
of the counter for your own good.

Out of my way, Jack!

JACK: You really ought to stay out of that.

Who said you could put that...
Keep them open.

Stop it. Stop it.

HORACE: Shit.

Never in my life have I ever seen
anybody as fucking stupid as you, boy.

I'm gonna have to kill you now.

Stupid? Stupid?

How stupid is this?

Or this?

Or this?

I get stupider by the minute, don't I?

What?

What?

Do you think this is the first time
I've seen a rape?

I'm not stupid.

But what was your credo again?

You sackless piece of shit.

Well,

I don't need a reason either.

You know what I don't like about you?

You smell like something should
have been dead a long time ago.

If you take my silence for fear,
you're mistaken.

The last time I saw a man hurt a woman,

I killed him.

And I swear on my life,

the last thing he thought
was how a man so quiet

could hit so hard.

I'm only playing, you know?

I mean, she should clean herself up.
Clean yourself up now.

We was just playing here.
Just clean yourself up now.

I don't need this shit, you know?

Playing with her, that's all.

All right, now.

I'm sorry. He's not usually this bad.

Sure he is.

But he won't be for a while,
at least not tonight.

You never know with him.

But you're still gonna
have to get out of here

'cause he will come back for you.

What about you?
Yeah, where am I gonna go?

Anywhere would be better than here.

Sometimes I think...

I don't know, part of me is afraid to think,

but I don't know anywhere but here.

Here is just a place, not a fate.

Where you gonna go?

The Mississippi.

What you gonna go fishing for down there?

Nothing.

I just never seen it before.
Yes, you have.

No, never have.

I took a detour to prison on my way there.

Anyway,

no one's ever done
what you did for me today.

I know you didn't need to do that.

Yeah, well,

I've needed to be able to do that all my life.

Took me 18 years
to get the nerve to do it once,

only to make a mess of it
when I finally tried.

Are you still pissed about last night?
I was drunk, for Christ's sake.

Besides, it never would have happened
if you'd let me in

instead of locking
all the goddamn fucking doors.

Shit, Mary. What about all them wonderful,
beautiful times we had together? Huh?

What good times, Ryan?
What the fuck has gotten into you?

Today marks the 18th anniversary
of my demise as a person.

What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you that dumb?

I always wondered
if you were as stupid as you looked.

Leo's birthday. Fuck!
I hate you.

How the fuck can you say that to me?
It's so easy.

How about all them times
when fucking me was the best thing

in that miserable little fucking life of yours?

Fucking you was always
the worst thing in my life.

You keep this shit up,
and I swear to God, Mary,

I will kick your fucking ass.

Come on. Come on, big boy, beat me up.
Beat me!

It's not going to change the fact
that I know that you know.

What the hell are you talking about?

What did you think?
What did you think when I was pregnant

right after that first time together?

Did you think because he was quiet
you didn't have to look at him?

That he didn't look like you?

RYAN: What the fuck are you talking about?

MARY: 'Cause he was good,
he wasn't yours?

It's not fucking true. It isn't true.

It is true.

That kid is not mine.

MARY: He's yours.
He's yours, you fucking loser.

Don't go trying to find a father
and pinning the fucking blame on me.

You hear me?

You've gone way too fucking far
this time, Mary, way too fucking far!

See this? See what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna fucking cut your head off.

Do you hear me?
Do it!

I'm gonna cut your fucking head off.
Do it!

Leave her alone!

Leave her!
MARY: Stop!

Leave her! Stop it!
MARY: No. Why did you do that?

MARY: (CRYING) Why did you stop him?

Ever get tired of the name
people call you by?

What? Gil?
Mmm-hmm.

No.

Been called Gil my whole life.

Well, I'd like to change mine.

What to?
Stephen.

Why Stephen?

Well, there's two men in this one book.

Stephen is the young one,
and Leopold is the older one.

One believes, and the other
spends his entire life doubting.

I feel like I've been old my whole life,

and I'm done doubting.

KINGSLEY: Mrs Bloom,

will you describe for the court
as precisely as you can, please,

the events that led up to Mr Eames's death?

MARY: Well, we were talking in the kitchen.

I know our voices were raised.

And I think Leo came home
in the middle of it.

And the next thing I knew,

Leo had a skillet over his head.

I couldn't stop it.

Mrs Bloom,

is it not true that Ryan Eames was about
to stab you when your son walked in

and saved you from what was sure to
be imminent bodily harm?

PROSECUTOR: Objection! Counsel is leading
the witness, Your Honour.

JUDGE: Objection sustained. Counsel,
ask your question, don't answer it yourself.

KINGSLEY: Was Ryan Eames about
to stab you when your son walked in?

He had a knife.

But he had had a knife before. I...

I wouldn't have known whether
he would have stabbed me.

KINGSLEY: Was Ryan Eames beating you
that afternoon?

Mrs Bloom?

How do you explain the multiple bruises
on your body that day?

I want the court to instruct her to answer.
Mrs Bloom, answer the question.

I have bruises all over my body.

Ryan and I drank and things got rough.
Well, did things get rough that day?

No more than usual.

I'm sorry?
No more than usual.

KINGSLEY: How would you describe
your relationship with your son?

PROSECUTOR: Objection, Your Honour.
That's not relevant here.

Oh, please, can I ask about intent?

JUDGE: Overruled. Answer the question.

As complicated as any
between a mother and a son.

KINGSLEY: Would you say
that you resented your son

for who you thought his father was?

PROSECUTOR: Objection, he's leading
the witness again, Your Honour. Please.

JUDGE: Overruled.
Did you?

No.

No, I didn't.

KINGSLEY: And I suppose it wouldn't matter
to know that Ryan Eames wasn't his father.

That's not possible.

Leo has always been like his father.
KINGSLEY: Yes, I suppose he has.

Because the people that I spoke to
say that Leo's father was a good man.

Blood tests show Ryan Eames to be sterile,
Mrs Bloom,

whether or not you ever cared to know.

I have no further questions for this witness.

JUDGE: Prosecution
have any further questions?

PROSECUTOR:
Nothing further, Your Honour.

JUDGE: The witness is excused.

The court will take a 30-minute recess.

I'm gonna put you on the stand.
No. No, you're not.

The jury.

Get up.

They don't want to believe her.
We have to have them hear your side of it.

No, I don't think so.

Hey, Leo,
it is 15 to 20 years we are talking about.

Why won't you tell them
how it really happened?

I took his life.

She took mine.

There's two reasons for you right there.

Hey! I don't understand that.

Yeah, well,

you don't have to.

What did you just do in there?

Do you realise what you did?

You hung him.

<i>What would it have cost you
to tell them why he did it?</i>

He did it for you.

He was defending you.

<i>Look at you.
I don't even know who you are any more.</i>

Could you look at me?

(GAVEL POUNDING)

In the count of first degree murder,

we, the jury, find the defendant,
Leopold Bloom,

guilty as charged.

I came to say goodbye.

You already did that on the stand,
didn't you?

I guess it's my turn to say goodbye.

That's why you're here, right?

Was it worth it?

Was what worth it?
Killing Ryan.

Was being in here worth killing him?

You mean, were you worth it?

I don't know.

I don't know what you ever expected of me.

I expected you to be someone that

I would love.

And from the first time I saw you, you were.

You thought it was your fault
they went away.

And mine, too.

I always thought
that it had to have been mine.

The way you were born, the day.

I never knew that you were Ben's.

And now that you do
it's okay that I'm your son?

No.

You killed me.

And I killed him.

And now we can be done with all of it.

Leo, no.


I'm so sorry.

Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't...

Don't leave me.

<i>STEPHEN: Dear Tom, I have finished at last.</i>

<i>I'm sending you the last book,
and as for any other bits and pieces,</i>

<i>I trust they will find their way
to wherever it is they are meant to be.</i>

<i>Thanks for everything, old friend.</i>

<i>VIC: "He could look down gravely
for however long he wanted to</i>

<i>"while the silence decided to declare itself.</i>

<i>"What was it I was thinking?</i>

<i>"And he could keep his mouth so still,</i>

<i>"and dedicate it to the pain.</i>

<i>"He could sit in a grey room long enough
and quiet enough</i>

<i>"to try to figure out what colour the air was.</i>

<i>"And he could gently lift a green rolled
ticket to his mouth</i>

<i>"and close his eyes
to divine the destination,</i>

<i>"waiting silently to be sure
he could hear the answer</i>

<i>"when it finally came blowing out.</i>

<i>"I declined to accept the end.</i>

<i>"He could look at his pant legs
for hours before he moved,</i>

<i>"following the crease in them
with his finger,</i>

<i>"so he could feel the flesh
they housed inside.</i>

<i>"Can we even bear it?</i>

<i>"And he could lean back
to be able to blend in with the wood.</i>

<i>"It could swallow his sluggishness,
which it was anchored in firmly."</i>

Hey, asshole!
Why do you look so surprised?

Were you dumb enough to think that
that was it, huh? Yeah!

Horace, come on.
You said you were just gonna scare him.

Shut the fuck up, Jack.

What is this? Huh, motherfucker?
You going on a little trip, were you?

Were you going
without saying goodbye to me? Huh?

What have we got here? What are you,
a fucking writer or something?

We got us a fucking little
Ernest Hemingway here.

Didn't he die with a goddamn fucking
shotgun in his mouth, pal?

Horace!
Huh?

Well, what's going on here?
Nothing, Vic.

You go and get me my breakfast, huh?
I'll be there in a minute.

Louis is taking care of your breakfast.

Well, why don't you mind your own
fucking business?

Go back to your room
and light up one of them hangers,

or whatever the fuck you do. Now go on!

This is my fucking business.
Oh, God!

My legs, my goddamn knees.

VIC: You want some of it?
HORACE: God damn you!

I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch.

You'd have to be able to get up first
to do that, wouldn't you?

Come on, get out of here!
Come on! Come on!

HORACE: I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch!

VIC: He ain't gonna kill you now.

I never would have let him.
Well, you're welcome, anyhow.

You'd better get the hell out of here
before he sends Jack out for you,

or in case someone
up and moves the Mississippi.

Ah.

I love this.

You smell that?

That's why I could never leave the South.

You better leave, though.

Go on, get out of here.

Good luck with that kid, now.

Thanks.

I will.

STEPHEN: Why...
Why are you running so hard?

Have to get a message to someone.
Have to go.

Well, I'm tired, so why don't you
sit down with me for a minute?

I can't. I gotta... I gotta tell him.

Tell who?

I just...

I gotta tell him.
Tell him what?

Tell him not to hit so hard.

Why?

Because bad things will happen
and everything will change.

Sit down. Bad things won't happen.

Sit down. You're out of breath.

I'm not supposed to run that hard.

What will happen
if I don't get the message in time?

You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

See, you don't know this,
but good things will happen up here,

and you'll write about them,
and when people see them, they'll smile

in a way your mama never could.

I'm gonna be all right, then?
Yeah, you'll be all right.

I know you're afraid,
but there's no reason to be, there never was.

You see, at the end of all of it, is this.

What have you been doing all this time?

Looking for you,

one way or another.

It's all I've been doing
since the day I was born.

Looking for you.

At least I found you.

<i>STEPHEN: This is finally my own story.</i>

<i>Each person has his own, and with that fact,</i>

<i>I am like everyone else.</i>

<i>STEPHEN AND LEO: Mr Jenkins always
told me to take time with my words,</i>

<i>so I suppose I'll try to do that now,
even though that was in the fifth grade.</i>

<i>STEPHEN: You see, I used to have
this problem where I saw too much</i>

<i>but never managed to find my way
to the right words</i>

<i>that would let me speak aloud on any of it.</i>

<i>I suppose it was like that
for a reason, though,</i>

<i>because what my eyes saw
didn't seem to me to be the things</i>

<i>that other people's ears
had any business hearing.</i>

<i>But I think of all that differently now,
so I will begin my story.</i>

<i>STEPHEN AND LEO:
My name is Leopold Bloom,</i>

<i>and my life began long before I was born.</i>

<i>LEO: Mother said I was the seal of her sin
and a sign of the grief she would face.</i>

<i>My aunt just said I was a quiet
little man who spoke with my eyes.</i>

<i>I was named after some man in a book</i>

<i>my mom read when she was in college
called</i> Ulysses.

<i>So, for a while, I thought I was named
after somebody great, a hero even,</i>

<i>STEPHEN AND LEO: but I was actually
named after a lost, tired man.</i>

<i>STEPHEN: I like the other man
in the book more,</i>

<i>but then, our last name wasn't Daedalus
and things like that can't really be helped,</i>

<i>just like with the books people like
and the names they give their children.</i>

<i>I learnt a lot from my mother
on the afternoon she told me about</i> Ulysses.

<i>I learnt what it was
that made dying and killing so easy for her.</i>

<i>I learnt where my name came from,
and I learnt later, to my own surprise,</i>

<i>that I had been named after a great man.</i>

<i>He may have been tired,
but he was never really lost,</i>

<i>at least not for long.</i>

<i>And neither am I, any more.</i>
