<i>REMY: What do I remember?</i>

<i>I remember reading about a scientist.</i>

<i>He had a thing for cats and boxes.</i>

<i>What he'd do
is take a cat and lock it in a box.</i>

<i>And then, just to make things interesting,</i>

<i>he'd also put this machine in there
that released poison gas.</i>

<i>Now, the scientist didn't actually know
when the machine would release the poison</i>

<i>and when it wouldn't.</i>

<i>The only way he could tell for sure
was to look inside the box.</i>

<i>Here's the science bit.</i>

<i>Until he opened it up,
he figured the cat had to be alive</i>

<i>and dead.</i>

<i>See, if either one was possible,</i>

<i>then both had to be possible, too.</i>

<i>Ever since I read about that cat,
I can't get the story out of my head.</i>

<i>Don't get me wrong, I don't give a fuck
about the plight of small, furry animals.</i>

<i>I just don't understand.</i>

<i>How can anything be alive and dead
at the same time?</i>

Affordability. It's only natural.

First of all, let me just reassure you

Eighteen hosts. 32 forgs.

Thirty-two and a half!

-Little people. Please, I have a cousin.

We found a boat heading out of port.
Look at these.

Two of them had scanning jammers.
We pinged them, they read free and clear.

I opened them anyway.
They had three forgs each.

What do you think, man?
What do you think, buddy?

Forget it.

Actually, Frank, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

-(CLEARS THROAT) Something...
-Yeah. Forget that.

Find somebody else.
Just get us our pink sheets.

FRANK: Suit yourself.

Okay, look. Can I just ask you something?
-Mmm-hmm.

What do you think

keeps a world like this's shit together?

It's not magic. It's not.

It's rules.

It's people abiding by the terms of the deals
that they sign themselves.

It's rules.

You know what's more important
than the rules, though?

It's the enforcement of those rules.

I mean, we got a responsibility, you and me.

I mean, what we do,

I mean, maybe it's small, I don't know,

but it matters.

It matters.


I'd actually work less hours.

You're sure about this?

A job's a job, right?

A job's a job.

Just make sure that they give you hazard pay.

You'll be sitting next to Frank,
in some booth,

telling some cancer-riddled prick,

"You owe it to your family.
You owe it to yourself."

There's a good chance
you'll choke on your own vomit.

You should go finish that T-Bone job.
-Yeah.

It'll be your last hurrah.

Get Carol a chance to blow off some steam
at the same time.

-JAKE: You got hit pretty hard.

All you got is scar tissue in there right now.

'Cause the unit's already doing its work.

Fuck!

We're supposed to be partners.

And you're just fucking up our shit.
You know that?

You're fucking up everything.

Don't you see that?

We've always been lucky here.

The metal graveyard's
a fucking treasure chest.

Thirty minutes,
you're going to be back on top.

You're gonna see, all right?

REMY: It's a black hole.

That's all it is.

(SCANNER BEEPING)

There it is, on a platter.
Esophagus. Five months over.

Okay, no, you're not ready to do a kid.

Fine, fine.

JAKE: Hey, hey, where are you going?


Liver and kidneys.

You want me to start?

All right, Jake.


You've done this a thousand times!

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You stay right here

until you get this done.

Then you find another one.

You find another one.
You get as many as you can.

I want you to get over this hump.

You do this.

<i>I may not be making the best use of my time.</i>

(BETH VOMITS)

<i>Two days of withdrawal.</i>

<i>It's not like I can't see the dirt or the scars

<i>I should leave.</i>

<i>But for some reason, I can't.</i>


<i>I saw an interview with a serial killer once.</i>

<i>Said it took him six years
to work up to his first kill.</i>

<i>The second, a year. The third, just a week.</i>

<i>Once that dam broke, it was a flood.</i>

<i>Making people die,
it had become second nature.</i>

<i>Apparently, it also works
the other way round.</i>

How you feeling?

Stop!

Stop! Stop it!

(CURSING IN SPANISH)

I didn't ask for your help!


What did you want me to do,
leave you on the street?

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

You're as fucked as me.



REMY: <i>It took me</i> a <i>while,

<i>He was trying to tell us something.</i>

<i>We're all alive.</i>

<i>We're all dead.</i>

<i>We're all that cat.</i>

<i>But we have to make a choice.</i>

<i>We either purr and lick ourselves

<i>or we scream and scratch and claw our way

You get nine hearts when I wasn't looking?

My uncle was a bank robber.
I ever tell you that?

Made a mess of the west coast,
knocking over savings and loans, you know.

And he was good at it.

Nobody ever knew a damn thing.

He thought he was home free.

He woke up in the morning,
went to work at the auto shop.

But every once in a while,

he'd skip out for lunch,
pull on a ski mask, rob a bank.

Then one day,
the cops came knocking at his door.

Let me guess.

He was relieved.


No, he was fucking pissed.

He went soft.

He was off his game. And he knew it.

Who do you think
Frank's gonna send after me? Ray?

Probably Ray.

I don't know.

Maybe me.


Mmm.

A job's a job.

You still believe that?

REMYI (WHISPERING) <i>Peter?</i>

-(SLEEPILY) Dad?
-Yeah.

Hey, listen, I'm going away for a while.

<i>It means I won't be able to pick you up

<i>But I'll think about you

BETH: What happened?

We got to leave.
-What?

I got caught trying to clear your forgs.

Now they'll want to know
where the rest of them are.

BETH: You're clear.

You can leave me here.
I'll be fine on my own. It's okay.

I did yours first. I didn't get to mine.

Are you coming?

<i>REMY: The thing is, I have an artificial heart,</i>

<i>and she has an artificial everything else.</i>

<i>Maybe we're two parts of the same puzzle.</i>

<i>Maybe it's not just her I'm trying to save.</i>

Why you giving this to me?

I figured you'd want the option.

Was I wrong?

Give it to somebody else.

You want it?

Didn't your eyes used to be brown?

Opticor 202, with kaleidoscope enhancement.

How do you keep track of all those things
you've got in there?

Let's see.

Pancreas and kidneys from the diabetes.

One went bad outside warranty.
I had to go black market on the replacement.

Liver, stomach and lungs, thanks to Q habit.

Knee from the car accident.

Upgrades. I've got eyes, ears, voice box.

Jackson Reproductive Replacement System,
release 5.3.

Lady Mystique model.
Comes in six sparkling colors.

Stop.

Flexor Dura-Joints. Billion step warranty.

Stop.

Ask me about my lips.

What brand are your lips?


Happy birthday.

It's not my birthday.

I guarantee, you'll run out of Repo Men

Great, great. This is just great.

Do you have any idea

One of my own guys jumping credit, huh?

Yeah.

Now take me out of the system.

Fine. Give me your heart.

I said take me out of the system.
-And I said give me your goddamn heart.

There is no way out of the system!

You screwed that up when you

Yeah! That's right, Einstein!

They pulled all the local scanners!

Now every artiforg reclaim

<i>With the M.5 Neural Net,
yesterday's dreams are today's reality.</i>

<i>Imagine your loved ones
living out the rest of their natural lives</i>

<i>in a world where they are always happy,
always content,</i>

<i>and always taken care of.</i>

You owe it to your family.
You owe it to yourself.

A little fruit for the fruit?

Why not?

Cheers.
