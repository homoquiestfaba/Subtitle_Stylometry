CARTMAN: Why did we
choose this life?

[thunder rumbles]

Why did we become superheroes?

We dedicate our lives to
fighting crime for one reason.

To make a billion dollars
on a superhero franchise.

Superheroes and video
games-- there's a lot of stuff

to take the piss out of you.
-Yeah.

There just is.

[epic theme music playing]

[phone ringing]

Hello, South Park.

TREY PARKER: We learned so
much from "Stick of Truth"

that we decided,
let's do another one

and take everything we've
learned and make it better.

MATT STONE: We did learn a
lot and I think this game is

going to be much, much better.

And now it's going to be worse
because I just said that.

Yeah.
Because you said that.

TREY PARKER: There's
"The Stick of Truth,"

and this literally happens
the next day in town.

Your superpowers
are not match for me.

Everybody switch games.

We're playing superheroes now.

TREY PARKER: And you're
still that same character.

You're still that kid that did
all that stuff with the stick.

This dork, like,
wearing a little crown?

And now something new
is happening in town.

And so, even though you've
really risen to prominence

in "The Stick of Truth"
game, they're all like, well,

you can't play this with us.

You're nobody again.

Does this look like
a superhero to you?

Just seems like a
perfect RPG thing of like,

you're this big, powerful
person and now you're nothing

and you've got to
work your way back.

FRANK C. AGNONE II: Matt
and Trey are both gamers.

They've really invested
a lot of time and effort

into this project,
and working closely

with Jason and his team,
to make sure that they

nail this process perfectly.

Even as we're first starting
to figure out the first ideas

of what it could be, we brought
everyone from Ubisoft down

and had them in those meetings.

We have this big fight
where the kids split up.

And that's basically back story.

How come I have to
have the Netflix series?

I want a move, too.

Do I get my own movie?

Not everyone gets
their own movie.

Maybe we'll just go and
do our own franchise.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Oh, you want civil war?

Is that what you want?
-Yeah, dude.

It's civil war. [beep] you.

Oh, [beep] you.

Get out my house.

Oh, it'd be so
cool for them to be

in a fight on opposite sides.



Mom, Kenny hit me
right in the face.

Our goal, what we said
from the beginning,

was we still want that feeling
that everyone had of putting

their underwear on the
outside of their pants

and running around with
a cape and being like,

I'm going to save the town.

KYLE: But then
we're just rehashing

the same old material.

There's nothing wrong with
doing the exact same movie

to start a franchise.

How's it going, brother?

My name's [squeals].

I started going back
and watching PewDiePie

play "Stick of Truth."

This game's really detailed.

You got to appreciate
it for that, man.

And it was just the best
material I could have.

Because it was
like I was watching

an audience member
play it and what

they were thinking about it.

They're all kind of similar--
the attacks or whatever.

I hear him going,
well, this part's lame.

And I'm like, OK.

That part's lame.

It was just great to
have that as a resource.

Dude, what the [beep]?

Who let this ordinary
citizen into the coon lair?

KIMBERLY WEIGEND:
There are RPG elements.

You can level up your character.

There are certain
powers that you

can equip to your character.

CARTMAN: Speedster.

Ah, yes.

Like the Flash or Quicksilver.

I like it.

KIMBERLY WEIGEND: You have
a team of buddies that

join you in all of your combat.

And they'll have their unique
personalities and powers,

as well.

WARREN PRICE: It is an
outrageous tactical RPG--

Bring in the thunder.

[electrical shock sounds]

WARREN PRICE: --in
a superhero suit.

This time, it's serious.

KIMBERLY WEIGEND:
Game development

is different from the way that
Matt and Trey run the show.

We are very familiar with
their process over there.

They do a six-day turn
around, from nothing to making

an actual episode for the show.

And we do have to elongate
that a little bit for our game

development process.

JASON SCHROEDER: One
of the challenges

that we knew we'd face
is that Trey wants

to try stuff and change stuff.

And we need to be as fast
as the show, or at least,

try to get somewhere close.

The process begins-- it comes
out of the writers' room,

where we start with a script.

GREG POSTMA: Trey
will give us a draft.

And the majority of
the artwork and design

work that's going into this game
is designed by our department.

Part of the fun
of the first game

was that you get to pick
what type of character

you are, what costumes
you get to wear.

Part of this game is going to
have that, too, where you get

to dress your character up
based on your superpower

or based on what type of
superhero that you are.

These are some concepts that we
created to get an idea of what

these kids would look like.

There's a very specific
style to South Park.

Not everyone can just
simply animate and make

it look like South Park.

There are a lot of little
nuances that I've had to learn.

It is much more complex than
some of the more high-graphic

games that I've
worked on, simply

because it's so hand-drawn
and it's a unique style.

There's a lot of attention
to detail on this show.

If you look at a tree, none of
the trees are exactly the same.

They have different
lines because everything

is hand drawn.

I think the hardest feature
that we've had to developed

so far has been combat.

The combat stuff is
definitely the most intense

technical gameplay part of it.

We knew we wanted to
keep it turn-based.

CARTMAN: We were hurt, yes.

But the intruder had
made a critical mistake--

he pissed you off.

Because that works really
well for timing and comedy

and allows us the
conceit of the boys

playing a game within a game.


CARTMAN: (CHUCKLING) Nice.

But we definitely wanted
it to be a Version 2.0.

I think we can all
agree that this kid

shows a lot of potential.

We're expanding
upon the combat,

moving from more
traditional JRPG

turnstile to something that's
a little more tactically based.

And that, pretty much,
allows our players

to have a lot more
flexibility, in terms

of how they attack combat.

Car.

Car.

Stay out of the
street, damn kids.


It's civil war, dick.

Being able to pick which
heroes they want at their sides,

combining powers and
abilities, and positioning

their characters adeptly.

You're actually having
to think a little bit more

about your next move and maybe
even two or three moves ahead.

TREY PARKER: You want
it to be complex enough

to be fun and challenging
and have strategies,

but you also want it
to be simple enough

that it looks like South Park
and it is just still fun.

MATT STONE: We established,
in "Stick of Truth,"

that you have a
magical butt hole.

And so this goes to the
next level, where you get--

TREY PARKER: We were
like, how can we

make your farts more
powerful than what

it was in "Stick of Truth"?

And we're like, we could
start to bend time.

Yeah.

If you make us think,
it really rips a hole

in the space time continuum.

You really rip one.

MATT STONE: Yeah, you
can really rip one,

which again, was
one of those things,

like oh, that's a great idea.

But then, when you start to put
it into a video game system,

it's really hard to figure out.

So I think we
figured out a good--

Yeah.

I think we figured out
a good time fart system.

[fart sounds]


TREY PARKER: A game is such
a different animal than a TV

show or a movie or anything.

I don't want just a movie
where I press x a lot.

MATT STONE: What I'm psyched
about with "Fracture" is that I

just like the fact that there's
something that we're doing

that we couldn't do in a show.

And there's a way to experience
the town and jokes in a way

that you couldn't
do in the show.

There are going to be those
moments where you're going

to look and go, oh, my god.

That was really cool.

We're really excited.

We're excited to tell
this particular story.

Hood rats.

Go.

[epic orchestral music playing]

CARTMAN: South Park.

The Fractured but Whole.


TREY PARKER: It was originally
called the Butt Hole of Time.

MATT STONE: Yeah.

TREY PARKER: They ran
it past the whatever

and they said you can't
put butt hole in the title.

The retailers won't
put butt hole--

The retailers
won't put it there.

--on a shelf.

So I just sat there at my desk
for hours going, butt hole--

How do I get past this?

Butt hole, butt hole,
butt-- butt hole.

Butt hole.

Butt hole.

Why did we choose this life?

[thunder rumbling]

Why did we become superheroes?

We dedicate our lives to
fighting crime for one reason--

to make $1 billion on
a superhero franchise.

Now let's go through
the plan one more time.

First, we start
with the coon movie.

Then we do the Supercraig movie.

Then Supercraig and Coon
will join forces in the Human

Kite movie, just
as we start ramping

up Kenny's Netflix series.

How come I have to
have the Netflix series?

I want a movie, too.

You have a movie, Mysterion.

You're in the third Coon
and Friends United movie,

after your Netflix series.

Yeah, but he's saying he
doesn't ever get his own movie.

Do I get my own movie?

Not everyone gets
their own movie.

This franchise plan sucks.

If we want to make
billions of dollars,

then I think we should start
with the Tupperware movie.

Right, start with
a black superhero.

Marvel is making a
black superhero movie.

Yeah, now.

They waited years
to get to that.

We follow their plan.

We do all the real people first,
then we sneak the black guy

in in phase three.

How about we just do
movies starring all of us,

like all the time?

But then we're just rehashing
the same old material.

There's nothing wrong with
doing the exact same movie

to start a franchise.

OK, JJ Abrams.

OK.

Oh, OK, so you're
on Cartman's side?

He just likes this
plan because he

gets two movies in phase one.

Guys!

We have to just
go with this plan.

We don't even have
one movie yet!

How did it get to this?

How did we grow so far apart?

You go with the plan.

Maybe we'll just go and
do our own franchise.

-Yeah.
-Yeah!

Oh!

You want civil war,
is that what you want?

Yeah, dude, it's civil war.

Fuck you.

Oh, fuck you, get
out of my house.

We'll make way more
money on our franchise.

Go ahead.

I bet you don't even get
halfway through phase one

on your franchise, DC Comics.

[door shutting]

I thought civil
war wasn't supposed

to happen until phase three.

Shut up, Supercraig.

[dramatic music]

I didn't want to
have to do this,

but you leave me no choice.

Did I just hear someone
use a micro-aggression?
