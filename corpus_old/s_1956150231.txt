BEWARE THE DOG KILLER

WHO ARE... JESUS AND THE BRIDES OF DRACULA?

Your rent is seriously overdue.
You have 5 days to pay or be evicted.

Hey, mom.
<i>Hi, honey. How are you?</i>

I'm okay.
<i>Good.</i>

<i>Good. Are you at work?</i>
Uh, yeah, it's kind of a busy day.

<i>Oh, I wanted to tell you this:
7th Heaven is playing on TCM tonight.</i>

Mom, I don't have cable.
<i>Aw, shoot, that's too bad.</i>

<i>It's a great Janet Gaynor movie from 1927.</i>

She's one of your favorites, right?
<i>Janet Gaynor? Yes!</i>

<i>Since I was a little girl, I've always admired her.</i>

<i>She's so talented and beautiful...</i>
Yeah. Well...

I better get back to work.
<i>Okay.</i>

<i>I'm giving you a big hug over the phone.</i>
Thanks.

Love you.
<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Have a good week, honey.</i>
Bye.

<i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

Come on, my little sweety pup.

It's swimming time.

<i>Hey!</i>

Hey, could you please turn your music down?

It's quiet as it gets.

Thanks, all right.

Come here, Coca Cola. Oh, we love this song, don't we?

Mmm, we love this song.

Fuck!

Hey.
Hi.

Good to see you, um...

It's... for the role.
Oh, cool.

Uh, come in, come in.
Oh, thanks.

So, weirdly, I had an audition around the corner,
and I thought you might wanna've lunch together.

You like sushi, right?

Yeah. Wow. Thanks.

Thanks.

What's that smell?

Well...

There're a lot of skunks around here...
Oh.

...in the woods by the golf course. So...

always spraying. Can't do anything about it.
Oh.

I love your poster.
Thanks.

I actually saw him perform in a concert,
believe it or not.

Wow. Is it signed?
Yeah. Recently and actually,

I know a girl who knows his daughter.
So I have his signature.

It's really cool.

<i>We're reporting live outside the Hollywood Estate
of Billionaire Mogul Jefferson Sevence.</i>

<i>Sevence has apparently gone missing after a
late night fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island.</i>

<i>Witnesses claim...</i>
Unbelievable.

<i>...they have seen him returning to the mainland,</i>

<i>and his car, a 1935 Duesenberg, has yet to be located.</i>

<i>Jeff, I love you.</i>

<i>Your family loves you.</i>

<i>- We love you, dad.
We love you, daddy.</i>

Aw.

<i>I know we're gonna see you again soon.</i>

<i>I know you're alive. I can feel it.</i>

<i>We're offering a $ 2 million reward for any
information that helps us find my husband.</i>

<i>I beg you for your help.</i>

<i>Please, bring daddy home.</i>

What is that?

It's the neighbors, they've a parrot.
Oh.

What's it saying?
I'm not sure.

"Not a friend"?

Maybe.

Hard to say.
Hm.

My favorite issue.

Why this one?

Oh... I found it in my, uh...

in my dad's tool box when I was really young.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Did you steal it?
Hm-mm.

I, um...

The girl on the cover was the first I ever masturbated to.

Hm-mmm.

She's pretty.
I know, huh.

The first thing I ever masturbated to

was probably a rerun of Charles in Charge.

Oh, my god, that's awesome.

Yep, I'm pretty cool.

What are these?

Hey, no, don't. Oh...

No, don't. Don't. I'll wrap it up.

Okay.

Sorry. I, uh...

<i>Come on. Go on.</i>

<i>Good dog.</i>

"Rotterdam"?

I don't think so.

<i>Come on.</i>

What you're looking at?

That damn bird.

"Only I know the secrets of Silver Lake.

"In time I will reveal the truth behind the
mysterious crimes, murders and disappearances

"within this cursed community.

"I have the answers.

"I will reveal all...

under the Silver Lake."

Jesus.
Yeah.

You know who writes that?

Yeah, a local guy.

Strange, but nice.

Did he come in here ever?

Sure. I've seen him.

I give you, like, 5 bucks,
if you pass my number on to him.

I don't know.

Come on. I like his working.

I'd like to meet him.

You're just passing on a number, it's not...

Okay, sure, but I don't need your 5 dollars.

Hello.

Hey.

Hm, look at that, Coca Cola,
this nice man bought you a treat.

Will you say thank you?

His name is Coca Cola?
Yeah. Dependable as sunshine.

Is that a coke's lady?
Yeah.

An old one, I think.

My great-great-grandma used to say
that she was a pretty smart lady.

What kind of dog do you have?

Oh, um...

my dog died recently.

Oh.

I'm so sorry.

Thanks.

Well, it was nice meeting you.

Yeah.

Yeah, I liked meeting you.
Um...

Do you want to come in for a moment, have a drink?

What?

I saw you spying on me earlier.

No, I was not...

At the pool.

Were you masturbating?
No!

No.

It's not that strange. I masturbate.
Me too, but...

Doesn't everyone?
Yeah, but...

I was just looking.

Okay.

I believe you.

You wanna get stoned?

Yeah. Sure, yeah.

<i>I think this is it, kids.</i>

<i>A great big room full of nothing
but rich millionaires and us.</i>

That's pretty. What is that? Is there an engraving there?

Yeah, from an old boyfriend.
Mmm.

Old boyfriend?

Hm-mm.
Hm.

Do you like my tattoo?

Is that real?
No, just temporary. Came with a pack of gum.

Thank God, it's temporary.

<i>- You like that, monsieur?
Comme ci, comme Ã§a.</i>

<i>- That guy's really the end of the line.
Still think he's kind of cute.</i>

<i>Who is he?</i>

I know you think it's gross.

Like, when I was sick in day school...

I ate my saltines and not my chicken noodles,

and with orange juice it was delicious.

It's like I've discovered an...

unknown combination...

that no one should die without trying.

<i>Sarah, were home...</i>

and we brought somebody.
Okay!

Don't you wanna go to a bar or anything?

I should probably call it a night.

Oh. Really?

Yeah.

I just want a drink.
I mean I don't wanna go home right now.

Um, not tonight. But, come over tomorrow.
Actually, we can lay here.

Look.

<i>What do you think?</i>

That's weird.

A little late in the summer to do fireworks, isn't it?

The leftovers, I guess.

Yeah.

Okay.

Good night.
Good night.

See you tomorrow?

Okay.

Better.

Fuck.

Fuck!

<i>That one's for you.</i>

<i>I write my name on this car.</i>

<i>I like this.</i>

<i>It is so hard, you could not erase.</i>

<i>Oh, man.</i>

Hey, come on, let's go!

What the hell, man?!

<i>Everyone in L.A. is wondering, where is Jefferson Sevence?</i>

<i>This man had literally been the face
of the city for decades,</i>

<i>with his charity work, his death defying daredevil antics,</i>

<i>his Hollywood production company,</i>

<i>the New York Eve's telecast, his public appearances
and award shows, the Rose Parade...</i>

<i>and that list just goes on and on.</i>

"Silver Lake and the east side of Los Angeles...

"were originally built around the silent films studios.

"Back then the area was known as Edendale.

"In 1978 a Silverlake resident discovered a
can of film in his basement.

"In the movie a young man holds a note
in front of the camera.

"It reads: 'No one will ever be happy here
until all the dogs are dead.'

"He then shoots himself in the head with a pistol.

"The man was an aspiring actor
who saw himself as the next Douglas Fairbanks.

"He was said to have been jealous of animals,

"specifically citing a deep contempt
for Teddy the Wonder Dog.

"He resented the dog's success
and blamed all dogs for his failed life.

"This author believes the suicide
of this obscure and failed actor

"might be the origin or impetus
for the modern day dog killer.

"Is Edendale cursed?

"For now the answers remain hidden...

"deep below the surface...

under the Silver Lake."

"Under the Silver Lake."

<i>What if the owner don't show up?</i>

<i>- Then I think they'll gas 'em.
Huh?!</i>

<i>You can take them to the dog home, are you, pa?</i>

They moved out.

How does that not make sense?

Who moves out in the middle of the night?

They wanted to leave.

They've forfeited their deposit, paid the lease,

they moved out. Nothing strange about it.

I don't understand why she didn't tell me.

I don't know. Maybe she didn't like you.

Maybe she knows your poor and haven't paid your rent.

Maybe she doesn't want to date a homeless man.

Speaking of rent: This isn't personal,

but I want you to know you'll be forcibly removed
if you can't pay in the next 4 days.

Yeah, I couldn't even find her online.

Huh.

That's weird, huh?
I know.

What you're gonna do?
I'm not sure.

Have you heard about these dog killers?

Um... Are there more than one?

Who knows? It's just...

It's creepy.

I mean it's bad enough to get mugged,
but that someone stabs your dog...

in front of your eyes, it's traumatizing.
Yeah, totally, huh?

Ow.

LOST DOG

15 YEARS OLD - COOKIE - REWARD

BOAT RENTALS

Fuck.

Welcome to purgatory.

Good to be here.

Yeah, sometimes I think about things.
Use it wisely.

All these holy trinities of women,
thriving like plants under the heat...

of the cities male gaze.
Three, three, three... three, three...

Jesus, we love you!

Is Jesus still here, or did he leave already?
I'm not sure.

He's with one of the brides, I think.
Romantically? - Probably.

He sure does seem to be making us
await for our hour with him.

One bride at a time.
He's a romantic.

You don't become a bride without fucking Jesus.

If he wasn't so handsome he'd never get around with it.

Blessed by the Holy Father, I guess.

Hey, do you know this girl?

Do you know where she is?

Hey! Fuck you! Seriously!

Get the fuck out of here! It's the ladies room.

Piece of shit! Asshole!

Why we won't name ourselves
"Jesus and the brides of Frankenstein".

Because there is so much aphorism and pop-culture,
we were worried the whole thing might tire someone.

Yeah, I can see why you were worried.

What you're doing here?
Hey, Allen.

Nice to see you.

Is that a woman's blouse?
I guess so. - Guess?!

What you're doing? Working?
Yes, of course. How about you?

Yeah... working... thinking about things... a lot.
How does the world work?

Why we're swimming on roof tops
when there's an ocean right over there?

Uh, I don't have the answers.
Who does? Nobody does.

Hey, do you know a red-haired, a blonde and a brunette...

that drive a white convertible rabbit?
No, but I'm looking forward to meeting them.

I gonna see if I can track them down.

I like that dress. Hi.
Hi. Thanks, Allen.

Oh, my god. Take a look.

Isn't that Millicent Sevence?
I think it is.

What is she doing here?
Isn't her dad kidnapped or something?

It's not, like, a classy move.
Well, hard to know, uh, hard to know

what a person might do when they're in pain.

I'm doing a secret solo show tomorrow at
Hollywood Forever. If you wanna come...

Yes. I'd love to.

This is your ticket.

Don't eat or break it. If it's missing anything,
even a crumb, they won't let you in.

Thank you.

I'm doing a secret solo show tomorrow...

Oh, my god.
What?

Looks like they've found Millicent's dad.
Hm? Really?

His body was burned or something.

He's dead?

Yeah.

Does she know?

Hello?

<i>Hi. One of the guys of the bookstore gave me your number.
You said you wanted to talk to me?</i>

Oh, sure. Yeah. Hi. Uh...

Yeah, I read your magazine and I wanted
to ask you some more questions about it.

Is there a good time for us to meet?

<i>Sure, of course. I'm actually writing all day tomorrow.
I'm finishing a new issue of "Under the Silver Lake".</i>

<i>But you're welcome to stop at the house.</i>

Uh, well, can you text me your address?
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

Okay, great. I'll see you then.

<i>Bye.</i>
Okay. Bye.

Fuck.

<i>We're looking at the footage
of the crime scene discovered earlier tonight.</i>

<i>The burning car, a 1935 Duesenberg, was spotted
by a resident who immediately called the authorities.</i>

<i>Now, it's hard to believe that the L.A. police chief has
confirmed that the remains are those of Jefferson Sevence.</i>

<i>As reported earlier, Sevence was found dead in his car</i>

<i>with the bodies of three women, believed to be prostitutes.</i>

<i>In addition, some unnamed sources have leaked
a very odd detail about the case.</i>

<i>Apparently the remains of a dog,</i>

<i>a breed known as Bichon Frise,</i>

<i>were found in the purse of one of the victims.</i>

<i>This has officially become a very grizzling
and puzzling murder investigation.</i>

<i>I'm joined now by...</i>

Fuck.

Who is the Owl's Kiss?

<i>The Owl's Kiss is a lost legend of folklore.</i>

<i>Just as terrifying as the Wolfman
or Frankenstein's Monster.</i>

<i>She is a woman who arrives in the night,
through windows and locked doors,</i>

<i>naked except for her mask of taxidermied owl skin.</i>

<i>She seduces men and women alike,
killing them in their sleep.</i>

<i>This beautiful spectre is responsible for
dozens of deaths within the Los Angeles basin,</i>

<i>though she has yet to be mentioned by mainstream media.</i>

<i>Theories abound as to her motives.</i>

<i>This author believes she may be a member of a longstanding
American cult with origins in trade and finance.</i>

<i>It's the unlucky soul who finds himself
the recipient of an owl's kiss.</i>

What a bunch of bullshit.

I can't believe Jefferson Sevence is dead.

It looks like every year more and more celebrities
decease. People I grew up with just die.

Dick Clark, Elizabeth Taylor, Johnny Carson...

Everybody dies.

Even those people that you think would be here forever.

What were those pages on your nightstand?

The ones with the scribbles on it.
Aw, it was nothing.

Come on, tell me, I wanna know.

Well, have you ever heard about, um, old

record albums having satanic messages on 'em
if you play them backwards?

Sure.

Well, I was watching Wheel of Fortune,
and I noticed that Vanna White did this...

a little pattern of glance that I saw of her.

She looked straight ahead, to the right,
to the left, and then back again.

I was wondering: Is that random?
Is there a reason, like a pattern behind it?

And if there is, maybe there's something new
in that pattern, so...

I started taking notes while it happened.

Passed seven month that I keep record.

I've just be thinking:

Why do we just assume that all this

infrastructure and entertainment
and open information and this beaming

all over the place, all the time,
and every single home on the planet

is exactly what we're told it is?

Maybe there're people out there who are more important
than us, more powerful and wealthier than us,

that are communicating things and seeing things in the
world that are meant only for them, and not for us?

I think it's fucking ridiculous to assume
that media has just purpose, right?

Hm, yeah.

Oh, you think that's weird.

A little.
Okay.

Don't you ever think that maybe rich people
know something that you and I don't?

A good restaurant... maybe.

Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but you smell so bad...

Yeah.
...and I... I think I should get going.

Don't you want thanks for the juice?
I'll be back when the smell goes away.

<i>Now Vanna White. Vanna is from Atlanta,</i>

<i>and she is...</i>

<i>a professional model.</i>

Come on in! The water is still refreshing.

MOVIE AUDITIONS

Christ!
Ough!

It's truly creepy, huh?
Yeah.

I don't even walk my dog anymore.

We use a litter box.
Hell.

What's that smell?

Oh! I don't know.

I smell it, too.
Oh, god! Aw!

Fuck!

Hey, that's my car!

Hey, don't! You can't take my car! Please!
It's my job, man.

You can't keep it if you can't make the payments.

I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW

Hey.
Hey.

Come on in.

Thanks.
You want a beer?

Yeah, please.
Hot day and a cold beer.

What are these masks?

They're life masks.

What's a life mask?

Um, it's a resin casting of famous people's faces.

Th... They're all real, and truly life
representations of these amazing people.

Most of them are from film productions, some were cast
by a sculpture or statue construction, like, um, Lincoln's.

That's his real face?

And this is, um...

Johnny Depp next to...

Grace Kelly.

Hm.

I really need to get a family.

So that I have somebody to leave this to, right?

These people, they...

they need to be remembered.

Stay quiet.

What?
It means "stay quiet".

It's, uh, a hobo-code.

Really?
Yeah.

Hobos and rail riders used it a lot in the 1930's.

Here.

Take a look.

They used it to let people know who was cool, who wasn't...

what houses offered food, if there was a doctor in town
that might be sympathetic to travelers. That sort of thing.

Okay. So why is it in Sarah's room?

And...

who they're telling to be quiet?
I don't know.

Maybe you.

There's been this rash of

lost and found signs

for dogs,

humans,

musical instruments...

All over the past 2 years.

Something really big is going on.

I know it.

And you think any of this could be connected to Sarah?
Of course.

It could be a lot of things. Um...

sex and drug trafficking, the cult of whale,

the dog killer... I don't know.

Lately, I just assume that

the Owl's Kiss has something to do with everything.

Mmm, I'm not so sure about that.

Do you have a dollar bill on you?

I might.

Here.

Take a look.

That's the sign from the Owl's Kiss. Right there,

on every dollar bill in this country.

With every transaction we're interact by her law.

Any household that eats, lives or trades under
her eyes is subject to her jurisdiction.

Our world is filled with codes, pacts,

user agreements, subliminal messages...

Here.

Here. Here.

Words and symbols, hidden in printed advertising,
sexual innuendo connected to corporations.

Ideologies used when we're adapted to free will,
but are actually a result of hidden messages.

Okay. So if there're messages that aren't subliminal

but that are meant only for certain people?

Of course.

That's as common as tits and hamburgers.

What's with all the cameras?
I'm trying to protect myself.

Do you know how many people have died from the Owl's Kiss?

No, I don't.

I got the place all wired up.

Nobody gets in here without me knowing, right?

Here it is. Here it is.

I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

I bought this from another collector 5 years ago.

I'm convinced that map

is the key to everything I've been searching for
my whole life.

Seriously?

Seriously.

Well, I think all you have to do

is mark now where the characters are hiding

and then send them this contest card right here.

No, it's not about this piece of toy.
It's the map. It's geographically the scale

from Silver Lake to the Hollywood Hills.

It is guiding me somewhere important.

And one of these days I will crack it.

<i>Hey, man.</i>

<i>Where is your car?</i>

Oh, it's in the shop.

It'll be painted over all the graffiti.

I told you.

That's what you get for driving a cart model.

I like my car.

And I like my cock, but I don't have to compensate for it.

Where the hell do you get something like that?
You can get everything. Amazon.

Check it out, man.

Silver Lake from above.

How is it going?

I'm, like, scaring out these houses.

I think to god this chick used to be, like, a lingerie
model or something. Insane body.

I mean, you know, you gotta be patient.

Dude, I feel like you've fucked up some very long time ago

and that you lead a wrong life, like a bad version of

the life you was supposed to have.
Come on, that wouldn't be fine.

I used to think that I was gonna be someone that, like...

that people cared about.

Like, maybe do something...

really important.

God, man.

Everyone thinks that.

That's narcissism and entitlement one on one.

I feel like somebody is following me.

Yeah, probably.

Let's say, who's not being followed these days?

What I meant, I'm getting that a lot lately,
like, hm, even before all this craziness.

That's the modern persecution complex.

Who needs witches and werewolves anymore, right?
Now we have... computers.

I swear to god, if they're released

the entire population is suffering from mild paranoia.

See, our little monkey brains,

they're comfortable knowing that we're all interlinked
and routed together now in some kind of

all-knowing alien mind hive.

And that shit is, as a straight-up says,
a pit for delusion, for fear...

Oh!

Looks like somebody's home.

â™ª Come with me â™ª

â™ª And you'll be â™ª

â™ª In a world of pure imagination â™ª
You're sick.

I'm gonna take off. See you soon.
Yeah, be careful out there, buddy.

<i>I think it would've gone further, but here mom came home.</i>

<i>She realized that I had a boy in the living room,</i>

<i>so she actually closed the doors to the den
to give us some privacy.</i>

<i>Then did anything happen?</i>

<i>I finally gave up, and we just watched cartoons.</i>

<i>Can I have one?</i>

<i>No.</i>

I say dumb her.

You're just a dumb rat.
Can we just shut up and try to watch the movie?

Yeah, I want to see my close-up.

Wow, there it is. I'm impressed!

<i>I have never seen such a big forehead.</i>

<i>All right, one cigarette. Then you got to go.</i>

<i>It looks like 20 meters high.</i>

Shhh.
Film stars.

Yes.
Yeah, on the big screen and boom.

Hey, are you the girls in the movie?

Yeah. Yeah, that's us.
Oh.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Do you like the movie?
Um, I just got here, so I...

But it seems like a nice movie.

Do you smell that?

Smells like skunk.
And pot.

There're a lot of skunks in Los Angeles.

Especially on the east side.

We have to go. Let's go.
Nice to meet you.

Go. Go.
Bye. Nice meeting you.

Easy, easy.
I'll get that ass. You know I'll get that ass. Come here!

You've to take a bite before I can let you in.

SUMMERTIME SECRET SHOW

Thank you everyone for coming.

I'd like to dedicate this first song

to the man who taught me everything I know.

This song is for Jesus.

â™ª Those good old days â™ª

â™ª Of tidying tense â™ª

â™ª And biting nails are gone â™ª

â™ª But in my mind â™ª

â™ª I know they will last forever â™ª

Record.

Record.

Record?

Record.

Record?

Thank you.

Record.

Record.

Hi!
<i>Record.</i>

How you're doing?
Work is good. I'm just floating on.

Hm. Yeah, I get it. Jack and Coke, please.

Hey, did you find those girls you're looking for?

Uh, no. Not yet.
Hm-mm. I'll keep an eye on it.

Three hot girls in a Rabbit.
Yeah.

Hey, have you noticed anything... like, um...
strange happening with this group of friends?

Well, that's... that's kind of a everyday scene, right?
Something out of the ordinary?

Right, yeah, but I'm just... I mean...
I guess I mean, like extra strange.

Last week I hooked up with this chick. She was...
Thank you.

...fucked up out of her mind. But she said
some weird stuff about Jesus and the Brides.

Like what?

That there's a message in the music.

A secret message?

Hm-mm.

So what does it say?
I've no clue, dude.

Who's the girl?
She's one of the many.

All right.
Crazy makes for good sex. Remember that.

I liked your dance last night. It was great.

You saw me?
Uh-hum.

Would you buy me one?

Uh-hum. Can I get one more, please?

Sure.
Thank you.

Thanks.
Yeah. Um...

Hey, can I ask you a...

question...

Yes.

Um... Have you ever seen her around?

That's Sarah.

Yeah. You know what happened to her?

Come with me.

Come on.
Where are we going? - To the basement.

<i>Record.</i>

Come on.

It's old music night in the Crypt Club.

I don't know her very well, but she was around.

Soirees, parties, and shows and stuff.

I don't know what happened to her, but I can tell you
that it nothing to do with my friends.

We're just enjoying our world.

Enjoying our bodies, enjoying our music.

I heard there's some type of code, like, secret message

in their music.

I'm pretty sure that's not true.

Jesus wouldn't hide a message in a message.

There is nothing to solve, you know.

It's silly wasting your energy
on something that doesn't matter.

We have this tiny little window

where we can have fun,

fuck,

be free.

Life is too short, right?

I wanna dance to this.

Come on.
I don't know this song.

Come on!

We should fuck!

Yeah!

What? What's wrong? What's wrong?

I'm... I'm feeling really strange.

Jesus.

How much of that cookie did you eat?

All of it.

Shit. Oh, fuck.

Sorry.

Fuck.

Hey.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait!

Hey! Hey.

Wait!

Wait!

Wait!

Hey!

Hi, mom.

<i>Hello! I'm so glad you picked up.</i>

<i>I have good news.</i>

<i>Remember I told you about that Janet Gaynor movie?</i>

Uh-hum.

<i>Well, I taped it for you,
and I'm gonna send it in the mail,</i>

<i>but I wanted to make sure you had a VCR.</i>

Oh, yeah.

I... got a machine. It's just not hooked up.

But if you send me the tape, I can watch it.

<i>Oh, good!</i>

<i>I just thought it would be something nice to share.</i>

<i>She's so lovely.</i>

<i>I... I feel connected to here. Is that silly?</i>

No, mom, it's not silly.

<i>Well...</i>

<i>I won't keep you. I know how busy you are. But I love you.</i>

Love you.

<i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW

Hey, man, do you really you gonna find
a hidden message in a pop song?

I don't know.

I just remember being in my room when I was, like, ten,

and created all this weird little codes
and secret languages.

This entire generation of men is obsessed
with video games, secret codes...

Yeah.
...space aliens...

Fuck!

It used to be a hundred years ago...

you know, any moron could wander through the woods and

look behind a rock or some shit
and discover some cool new thing.

Not anymore.

Where's the mystery that make everything worthwhile?

We crave mysteries, because there's none left.

YOU, ALL ALONE, YOU AND I, THE TWO OF US,
TURNING LIKE TEETH, SIGH, OH, DEAR

Fuck.

Okay.

JEFFERSON SEVENCE DEAD. WHY IS HE GONE?

ENJOY THE COMPANY OF HOLLYWOOD'S
UP AND CUMMING INGENIOUS! TONIGHT.

CALL NOW!

Hey, it's you.

Hey.

What do you do?

Nothing.

I meant your work.

Oh, god. All I'm ever hearing is:

What do I do for work? Do you have work?
Where you work? Working good? Working hard?

People have to work.
What about you? You're in a movie. Why you're...

doing this?

It was only one movie and... I didn't earn a penny.

Do you know how expensive it is here?
Yeah, I do.

Do you want a blow-job from the supporting actress
Academy Award nominee from last year?

Call Shooting Star.

Or do you want to do it with girlfriend
of the lead in the biggest sitcom?

Call Shooting Star.

You wanna fuck an It-Girl? It's not that hard.

You are a patron for the arts and I can pay my bill.

You pay me with credit card, right?
Uh...

Can I ask you something?
Sure.

I was wondering...

last night at the cemetery, who was
that paranoid looking guy in the limo?

No idea.

You don't know his name?

No, he's anonymous.

You don't know anything about him?

Okay.

Do you have anything to eat?

I know this girl.

Really?
Uh-hum.

How'd you know her?
Sex, a party a few years ago.

Oh, yeah?
Hm-mm.

Did you talk to her?
No, that was not possible.

Why?
Um...

She was on this glass cube

in the middle of the living room.
It was like some pop performance, I guess.

And she was just sitting there
wearing a dalmatian fur bathing suit,

not moving nor making eye contact.

All these drunk old men were tapping on the glass,

but she didn't move.

Who took you there?

Some nasty producer.
He brought me and some girls as dates.

What is his name?

I don't remember.

He makes these big action films
based on household cleaning products.

Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

Yeah. So, we get there,

we get through the gate,

they check our IDs,

and...

then we're just free to go wherever we want
in that luxury neighborhood.

We just can go in any house we want, any room we want.

There's food everywhere, and music,

dancing, craziness...

Just a big open party like than ones that Gatsby gave.

So, who's place was it?
Nobody really said. That was weird.

But...

there's this one house,

the biggest house of the block, this big stone mansion.

And we were not allowed to go there.
It was the only place off limits.

I heard some girls in the bathroom talking about

how it belonged to some songwriter.

Must've been a famous song.

Hm, no shit.

Okay.

YOU... 1, 2, 3.

ALL... 1, 2, 3.

ALONE... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

YOU... 1, 2, 3. Three.

AND... 1, 2, 3.

I... 1.

TURNING... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven.

LIKE... 4.

TEETH... 5.

â™ª You, all alone, and I â™ª

â™ª The to of us â™ª

"T"... "O" and "N"...

The end.

"Rub Deans head now... aitnder Newton."

"Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."

"Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."

"Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."

Okay. "Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."
What the fuck does that mean?

Dean Martin, Harry Dean Stanton,
Dean Koontz, Richard Dean Anderson,

Dean of Admissions, Dean Stockwell, James Dean.

Rub Deans head... Rub Deans head...

James Dean's head. Huh.

Huh!

Rub Deans head.

Copernicus.

Galileo.

Kepler.

Where are you?

Newton. Okay. Rub Deans head and wait under Newton.

Okay.

I saw you...

rubbing the statue's head.

Uh-huh.

Here. Put that over your eyes.

I'll take you where you're looking to go.

Who are you?

I'm a homeless king.

Really?

Yes.

Where we're going?

Just concentrate on walking, okay?

Some people don't realize the smell about themselves,

but you...

don't have a good smell about you.

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday, dear Nathan â™ª

Is that a dog?

It's a coyote.

But it won't gonna bite me, right?

No.

Coyotes are... blessed creatures.

If you ever find yourself alone with a coyote,

you don't run away.

You follow it, see where it takes you.

People say that we own land.

The streets,

the gardens, the hills,

the houses and the caves...

everything belongs to the coyotes.

They just let us use it.

Where are we?

You know I can't tell you that.

Sure. Of course.

Okay, though.

This way?

Fuck.

It's a fucking bomb shelter.

<i>Dear customers, the discounted cleaning products
are located in aisle 2.</i>

<i>I need the price of 5 hamburgers, ma'am.</i>

Can I help you?
What's going on?

You're a friend with the family?

I just know him, but not very well.

The neighbor found him.

Committed suicide.

God.

He didn't seem suicidal.

Yeah. I spent two hours in the man's house.

There's something's wrong about him.

Okay.

TREASURE HUNT!

Okay.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck!

Allen.
<i>Hey, sir, how are you?</i>

Hey. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

Um, I were wondering if you might know
how I can get in touch with Jesus?

<i>I'm the wrong guy to ask.</i>
All right. I mean the lead singer in the band.

<i>Yeah, I'm fucking with you, man.</i>

<i>What are you doing right now?</i>
Walking home.

<i>Can you play chess?</i>
Not really.

That'll work. I'll be at your place in ten minutes.

This is an cable TV actor who likes to have people around,
so he throws these chess parties

with hot chicks and guys who like to play chess.

Hm, that is... a terrible move.

I'll be right back.
You sure you wanna do that? - Yeah.

What the fuck, man! I'm taking a shit!

Just let go off me!

Why did you put a code in the song?
What you're talking about?

What are the tunnels for?
What?

Why are you beating me?
You understand "Turning Teeth".

The fuck you coded. I need to know why you
put it there and what the fuck it means!

Help!

Fucking tell me!
I don't know anything about a code.

How could you not know? You wrote the fucking song.
No, I didn't.

I wrote most of them, but not that one.
Bullshit.

Honestly! The label gave me a few songs to record.

And the rest are all mine.

Which songs they gave you?

"Turning Teeth", "Wire Mountain", and
"Waltz of the Christian Shit Farmers".

That's all of your hits.
There's no reason to belittle me.

All right. So, who wrote the songs?
I don't know. There're delivered anonymously.

I got a call from someone of the label.

They said not to ask any questions, but if I didnâ€™t
record the songs I would lose my contract.

Are you telling me you don't know
who wrote your own hit songs?

He didnâ€™t give a name! No!

He just said it was an important piece of music
by the songwriter.

The songwriter?

Yeah! The songwriter!

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.
Hm, what is it?

Uh, you remember that party you told me about?

A place in a neighborhood owned by some songwriter.

Can you take me there?

Okay.

How do you all know each other?

We're roommates.

We work together.

We're all Shooting Stars.

You too?
Yeah.

I didn't know you're an actress.

I was on a soap opera between
the ages of five to six months.

Come in, son.

Did you write the song "Turning Teeth"
for Jesus and the Brides of Dracula?

And the codes in the music?

I found the tunnels and the bomb shelter.

Okay.

So, what does that all mean?

Come and sit down. Here.

Is that...

Is that Kurt Cobain's Fender Mustang guitar?

Well, I don't know. Probably. I don't remember.

I have so many things.

Can I pick it up?

I don't always worry what the message is.
I just pass it along.

I slip it between the notes.

I hide it away from people who know it's there.

You said you've done this before?

Codes?

I wrote the music your dad grew up to.

Half of what you're singing along to as a kid,
and I'm still good.

And these teenagers are dancing to my music.

â™ª I want it that way â™ª

â™ª Tell me why â™ª
You're telling me there's...

hidden messages in old pop songs?

In movies, television shows,

everything you know.

Why?

That's pop culture, isn't it?

You throw it away like tissue paper.

When I blow my nose,

I find a used Kleenex, I recycle it,

and there is your wedding song.

Here it comes.

â™ª I don't know what love is â™ª

â™ª And I want you to show me â™ª

What are the tunnels for? Is there gonna be a war?

Aw, hell, I don't know.

I'm just trying to make a living

and earn a few dollars.

Well, you have everything.

No.

You know this girl?

Well, isn't she pretty.

â™ª Earth Angel â™ª

â™ª Earth Angel â™ª

She was killed...
â™ª Why won't you be mine? â™ª

...along with Jefferson Sevence' murder.

I think you already knew that, huh?
No, I did not.

But I don't care what's fashion or cool.

It's all silly and it's all meaningless.

I created so many of the things that you care about.

The songs that give your life purpose and joy.

When you were 15 and rebelling,
you were rebelling to my music.

Uh-oh.

That one you know.

That song was not written on a distorted guitar.

No, I wrote it.

Here, on this piano, somewhere between
a blow-job and an omelet.

There is no rebellion.

There's only me earning a paycheck.

I don't believe you.
Oh, good.

Because the real message was not meant for you.
So, it's better if you just smile, and you dance,

and you enjoy the melody,
because this ugly old man... me...

I am the voice of your generation.

Your grandparents, your parents,
and all the young people that follow you.

â™ª I love rock and roll â™ª

â™ª Drop another dime in the jukebox, baby â™ª

Aw, look at you.

Everything that you hoped for, that you dreamed about
being a part of, is a fabrication.

Your art,

your writing,

your culture...

is the shell of other men's ambitions.

Ambitions beyond what you will ever understand.

That's funny to you?
That's a little bit funny. Don't you think?

Because I wrote this!

And I wrote this!

And I wrote this.

Stop it.
And I wrote this, too!

Stop it!

Who's paying you to write these songs?

Who's paying you to write these songs?

Oh, shit!

<i>Look! You fools, you're in danger!
Can't you see? They're after you!</i>

<i>They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!</i>

<i>They're here already! You're next!</i>

Fuck.

Hi.

I here to inform you that you have
to evacuate the premises immediately.

Is it about my rent?
Yeah. You haven't paid. It's...

...criminally overdue, it's what it is.

Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

Ca... Can I please just get a couple more days?
No, I don't think so.

Please. I haven't anywhere else to go, and I'm really,
really, close to getting the money. I promise.

Listen.

I don't like this either. Worst part of my job. Okay?

Yeah, I understand.

I can give you one more day. But that is it.
Thank you.

If you can't pay, I will not be
the nice guy you see right now.

No. No. I want him out... now!
Hey.

I'm handling this. Don't be greedy.

I like your shirt.
<i>Yeah, think about it.</i>

<i>No duties. I mean it is...</i>

<i>- ...like I want. That will on the highest south.
Hm, can you bring me along?</i>

<i>I'd love that. You could make the photos.</i>

<i>Okay, that girl is the youngest one to ever write, produce,
direct and sound design her own network's sitcom.</i>

<i>How old is she?</i>

<i>She's 12, but she's really an old soul.
Honestly. She really captures the Zeitgeist.</i>

<i>I don't think there's any adult that could ever express that
kind of deep understanding that she has over her material.</i>

Hey.

How are you?

Go... Good.

I'm glad to hear that.

Um...

This is my fiance.

Hi. How are you?
Hehehe.

Congratulations.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Yeah, thank you.

So, how is work?
Great.

Good.

I saw your billboard.

Cool. Which one?

You've more than one?

I only was aware of Los Feliz, right near the Bigfoot.

You know, I'm glad it's getting out there.

You know... I'm working hard.

Just... I gotta keep trying.

Yeah. I mean... same here.

Well, it was really great seeing you.

You, too.

It's beautiful, isn't it?

Yeah, it is.

Do you know who painted it?
No.

Gaynor.

It's Janet Gaynor, the actress.

Wow.

My mom likes her.

Yeah, I like her, too.

Do you know who I am?

Yeah.

I was friends with one of the girls who was with your dad.

She was really a nice person.

Huh.

I'm trying to find out what happened to her.

Really?

What, do you know anything?

So, what do you think it all means?

I'm not sure, yet.

I can't... I can't quite see it, but I'm close, I think.

Oh, god.

I don't think we should be walking around here at night.

I think we're safe. We don't have a dog with us.

GOD WILL JUDGE YOU, DOG KILLER!

Yeah, but anybody who could kill a dog
wouldn't think twice about killing a person.

I'm not sure if that's true.

Say, are you a cat person or a dog person?

It's hard to say. I got bit by my grandparents
terrier when I was a kid, so I...

I guess I'm a little afraid of them.
Oh, god, that's awful.

Do you have a little change?

No. No.

No. Sorry.
No money to spare, huh?

Does your lady know you're cheap?

Fuck you!

Ugly piece of shit! Worthless twack! Motherfucker!

You're more broke than I am! Fuck you!

Come back here and sit down next to papa!
I'll shit in your mouth!

Asshole! Fucking dick twat!

I know it's not okay if I say this,
but I fucking hate the homeless.

Everybody says we've to take care of them,
but I think they're fucking bullies.

Poltergeists.

You mean ghosts?
Yeah. Yeah.

All they do is just...

float around on the edges of the peripheries
and watch people

eating delicious food, drinking beer, and falling in love.

They can't participate, feeling jealous,
and then they harass us.

Why don't you just give him a dollar next time?

Have you ever been in there?

What?

In the reservoir?
Yeah.

Come on.

I think someone's been following me.

Are you kidding?

I wanted it to look like a creative screw.

We will not?

I found this hidden in my dad's office.

H6 to G4. Like a chess move?

Your dad played chess?
Yeah, he did.

Get down. Get down!

H6 to G4.

What the fuck are you saying?

H6 to G4. H... 6... to G... 4.

NPM 1: 35 to 37.

NPM. What the fuck does NPM mean?

NPM. NPM.

NPM. NPM.

NPM.

What does NPM stand for?

NPM.

NPM.

NPM.

NPM. NPM. NPM. NPM.

NPM 1.

Nintendo Power Magazine, issue 1.

Page 35 to page 37. 35 to 37.

Okay. Page 35. 35, 36, 37.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I...

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Okay.

H6 G4, H6 G4. H6...

Calm down. Calm down.

H6.

To G...

1, 2, 3, 4.

G4.

H6 to G4.

What the fuck should I do with that?

Marco!
Polo!

Marco!
Polo!

SECRET MAP INSIDE EVERY BOX!

Fuck. He has it.

Wow. Oh, my god. You were right.

You were right.

H6... to G4.

So, that's the reservoir, and that's Mount Hollywood.

SATELLITE IMAGE UNAVAILABLE

What the fuck is in there?

THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE

Hello.

Can I help you?

Yeah.

My friend Sarah was killed.

These three girls know something about it.

Why do you assume that?

I don't assume it.

I saw her

taking things

from Sarah's apartment,

and I found a... a hidden code in their friend's music,

and I've been in the tunnels.

All right.

Please, sit down.

Have some tea.

I found... a shelter down there.

Some... some kind of bunker,

in case of a nuclear war.

It's not a shelter.

So, what is it?

A tomb.

Was it ours?

They're tombs for kings

like me

and Jefferson Sevence.

Why would Jefferson Sevence need a tomb
underneath the city?

Is the cemetery not good enough for him?

It's not about a burial.

It's about ascension.

We're not dying, we'll be transported to
another world, somewhere better than this.

Are you talking about heaven?
No.

I'm talking about something

exclusive

and real.

Our souls are gonna be pulled from our bodies

and carried through this unfathomable amniotic sac.

We will be beyond this universe,
living together like kings, without limitation.

The pharaohs did it.

Great men throughout the history have done the same.

Are you dying?

Not, but I'll be sealed in a tomb with my beautiful brides

and all with my worldly possessions,

and we are going to have delicious meals,

and wine, and television, and sex,

enough to last six months.

And then you die?
No.

We wait to be ascended.

Only the richest of men can afford this ceremony.

It's expensive

to build a tunnel system and keep it hidden.

But it costs much more

to murder people without being harassed about it.

Did you kill Sarah?

No one will find our chambers for a thousand years.

In the future men will understand

that we were modern kings.

Rulers without statues or effigies.

She was here?

Oh, fuck.

Is Sarah alive?

She may have ascended already. I don't know.

She's down there in one of those things, those tombs?

With Jefferson Sevence?
Yes.

They found his body.

They found another man's bones
mixed with most of Jefferson's teeth,

some of his skin,

and all the organs that he can live without.

Ow, such an angry thing to do.

What are you upset about?

I just wanna see Sarah.

Well...

Why don't we see if we can get her on the phone.

Do you have a phone?

Incoming calls only. We had trouble in the past.

People getting scared and try to get out.

She's trapped down there?

You don't wanna lose out on eternal life

just because we might have a normal physical aversion
to being buried underneath the earth.

That's only human.

Fuck.

Hello.

How're you?

Uh-huh.

Okay. Good.

Do you mind if I put you on videophone?

A friend of yours is here. He wants to see you. Great.

<i>Hello?</i>

Sarah, can you... can you hear me?
<i>Yeah.</i>

I... I've been looking for you.

<i>Really?</i>

<i>You hardly know me.</i>

Yeah, I know, uh...

Are you annoyed at me, or angry?

Did I sound angry?

Oh.

<i>Well, no, I just wanted to know what happened to you.</i>

Oh.

<i>Uh, you really wanna be down there?</i>

Yeah.

You're go... You're gonna die down there. Um...

Is that what you want?

<i>I'm gonna take this in the other room.
Will you hang it up when I get in there?</i>

<i>Sure.</i>

<i>Their chamber was covered in a mountain of concrete.</i>

<i>It can't be opened.</i>

There's no reason to upset that girl.

Please, be kind.

<i>Got it!</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Do you think I've made a mistake</i>

<i>coming down here?</i>

May... maybe.

<i>Well...</i>

<i>there's no getting out now,
so I may as well make the best of it.</i>

Yeah.

Same here.

<i>So...</i>

<i>how're you?</i>

Not great.

<i>Have you thought about getting a new dog?</i>

No.

<i>Maybe it'd be good for you.</i>

<i>An unconditional love.</i>

Yeah, I'll think about it.

Well, I better get going.
I said I'd make dinner tonight and

I've a million things to do.

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Well, enjoy... your dinner.</i>

Take care.

Bye.

Last night...

I had a vision of us making love beneath the earth.

And we were swimming together, naked, in a dark pool.

And that's when it happens.

Our bodies dissolved into light.

And every beautiful thought we've ever had
roams around us,

and carries our souls through space

into another world.

And we're all just

laughing the whole time because we know

that nothing can ever be wrong again.

I wish you were coming with us.

This isn't a world that anyone with any sense stays in

or spends much time worrying about.

You're living a carnival,

throwing little plastic rings at oversized pop bottles

hoping to win a price.

What are you gonna win?

A two week vacation?

A new car?

A little money to retire on?

It's all just a

shitty sawdust filled rabbit.

The things you care about

are useless where we're going.

Why have I come to this horrible place?

How did you know I was here?

We smell you.

Huh.

Ah, fuck.

What happened to that man and those girls?

They were waking up right now in their ascension chamber.

Are you gonna kill me?

Do you know what you did wrong?

No.

We found these in your pocket.

Why do you have dog biscuits in your pocket?

I used to...

I liked a girl who had a dog.

When was that?

A long time ago.

Did she stop loving you?

Yeah.

Why do you have dog biscuits in your pocket?

Because I was waiting for her to take me back.

I wanted to give the dog a treat and rub its ears.

Just the way I used to, and then
everything would be good again.

You can go now.

Really?

Yeah.

You're not...

not gonna kill me?

I don't think so. We might. I'm not sure, yet.

But, obviously, don't mention any of this to anyone.

I won't.

Okay.

Dag.

Bye.

I CAN SEE C... HAMBURGERS ARE LOVE

I'M NOT USED TO BEING HAPPY...

IT'S FUNNY... IT HURTS.

I'M AFRAID!

NEVER LOOK DOWN... ALWAYS LOOK UP!

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

Is that patchouli?

No.

Hm.

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

What's that bird saying?

I don't know.

Honestly I always wondered, but I have no idea.

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>Hollywood!</i>

<i>I mean, look at this shit.</i>

<i>That all over here had to be taken out
to clear the apartment...</i>

<i>God damn it! Look what he painted there!
What is that?</i>
