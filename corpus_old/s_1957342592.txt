Candace.

Dude, it's me.

I know, Sam,
but them's the rules.

Dude, it's like
a tiny, teeny poster.

No one is even
gonna notice.

Dave will be here tomorrow.
Why don't you come back then?

Tomorrow's the show.
It's too late.

Dude.

That's fucking lame, man.

Come on. When did you
become like
a corporate shill?

What is this?

Yes, that's me.

Selling my soul here
at Bop Street Records.

Well, that's how
it starts, man.
That's all I'm saying.

Check yourself.

Check yourself.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

All right.

Thank you, guys.

Thanks for coming out
 on a Tuesday night.
 We're The Effort.

On your way out,
 please stop by

and see Amy
 at the merch table.

Amy, you wanna
 wave to the crowd?

Which one?

(SAM LAUGHS)

Which one, yeah.

She's a comedian.
 That's a joke about, uh...

Yeah. That's really funny.
 Thank you. Um...

Anyway, thanks
 for coming, guys.
 I'll see you next time.

Why do you have
to act that way?

What way?

Why do you have to
shit on me in front
of the whole band?

The whole
fucking audience?

Oh, you mean
all six of them?

You see?
That's what
I'm talking about.

Little fucking, conniving,
undermining, like,

stabbing-me-with-
a-toothpick bullshit.

Why do you do that?

I was making a joke.

I don't think it's funny.
All right?

You take yourself
too seriously.

You know,
it's not about that.

It's about basic respect,
Amy. All right?

You just, like, wake up,
and just like,

"Hey, let's just
fuck with Sam today!"

Where's my cheese?

That shit
is not cheese.

Well, thank you,
cheese guru,

but where is it?

I threw it away.

You threw it away?

Well, thank you
very much.

Why did you do that?

It's my fridge.

It's my cheese.
I bought it with
my own money.

I want you to move out.

Huh?

Uh...

What?

Like now?

Whenever
you wanna go.

Uh...

Okay. Um...

All right. I'm going
to go now, then.

Be my guest.

Okay.

I will pick up
my records later.

If... Is this
like a money thing?

'Cause, like, I
deposited a check,
and, I mean...

Sam, is this
really a surprise?

WOMAN: You guys
sound familiar.

Do you guys play
a lot of shows around?

Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, we played at
The Funhouse,
fucking rocked that shit out.

Sold it out.
It was awesome.
Nice.

And, uh,
Calamity Records
has our demo, so...

Oh, really?

You know them?

That's awesome. Sure.
Yeah. Yeah, so,

keeping our
fingers crossed.
Yeah.

Good luck.

Thanks.

You see, you're, like,

cute, sweet, nice.

Why do women
start that way

and then just turn into

passive-aggressive,
conniving

assholes?

I mean, you know
what I'm talking about.

Just tell me straight.

'Cause I know you know.

Excuse me.

What?

Dude, I was just
kidding around...

(BEER BOTTLE BREAKS)
Fuck!

Shit.

Fuck off.

Oh, yeah,
you're badass.

Is that the size of your penis
or your fucking IQ,

you asshole.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

MAN: Hang on, man!

Oh, Jesus, dude.

What the fuck happened
to you?

I got a, um...

Couch?
Yeah.

Don't worry about it.

Whoa.

Sorry.



MAN: Down, down.
Ow!

Down.
Jesus.

Sorry, man.

Who are you?

I don't even know
anymore, man,
I'm so fucking tired.

We picked up this shit

from Devon's brother
at the Circle Jerks show

and we've been
flying crazy

for, like,
36 fucking hours, man.

If I even see
the inside of
that van again,

I'm gonna freak out!

No fucking joke.

I really, really,
really, really

need some Q-tips.


SAM: Just to be clear,
 like, I'd just be
 sleeping there.

Like, I'm super busy
days and stuff, like...

Okay.

See you at practice.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)


Hey, it's your
favorite nephew!

SHARON: So, let me guess.

You need a place to crash.

All right.

Technically,
I do, I just...

Like, so small
amount of time...

Sam.

Sharon, I know.

You're 34, man.
I just...

I got my shit
together this time.
I swear to you.

Totally different.

You working?

Yeah.

I mean, it's not
like a jobby-job
thing or whatever,

but it's like...

Some potentially
really cool shit
brewing with the band.

Does it pay?

Yeah. It pays,
sometimes.

I mean, you know,
it's not, like,

set in stone or whatever,
but, like,

there's this cool
record label called
Calamity Records,

and they have
our demo, and

we're just, like,
waiting to hear back
and stuff, so...


Dude...

Why are you looking
at me like that?

Like what?

Like I'm
full of shit.

Are you?
No.

Not this time,
I'm serious. I...

Legit, straight up.

Of course
you can stay with us.

But Sam,

get a fucking day job.

I'm on it.

(INDIE ROCK SONG PLAYING)


SHARON: Hey, honey.

Hey.

Oh, here.

Sign.

What'd you do now?

I threw a squid.

We need to talk.

What?

Your father can't go
camping this weekend.

A work thing came up
in Denver suddenly
and he can't get out of it.

He feels
absolutely terrible.

But listen...

Listen!

I talked to my boss,
he gave me the
weekend off,

and so I can
take you guys.
Hey, Oliver!

Ollie!
Why would I
wanna go with you?

Oliver.


(DOORBELL RINGING)

SHARON: He promised,
Sam.

Told him how much
he was looking forward
to it. Blah blah blah.

Yeah, well,
surprise surprise.

How often does he see
the kid? Twice a year,
for Christ's sake?

Sharon,
guy's an asshole.

Big shocker.
Oh, big shocker.

So is Oliver upset?

He's heartbroken.

Of course,
it's all my fault.

Everything's
my fault these days.

He's 14,
all right? He's...

He's in his crazy
little bastard phase.

I remember when
you were in that phase.

(INDIE ROCK SONG PLAYING)

SAM: Yo!

Hey! How's the
job search going?

Really good, actually.

You got something?

Uh, nothing solid,
but, like,

I mean, ton of leads.

What's up, dude?
What's up?

Hi, I'm Jake.

Sam.

JAKE: So, I hear
you're a musician.

You hear correctly.

Going through a bit
of a jazz phase.

I prefer Ella
to Billie.

In general.

Hey.
SHARON: Hey.

Hey, Sam.

What would you
say to, uh,

taking the boys
camping this weekend?

Really?

Uh, yeah.
I mean...

I don't know.
I guess I...

You know what?
Actually...

Fuck. I can't.

Well, why not?

They would love to
go with you. I'll throw
some cash your way.

Yeah, I know. I just feel
like it's more of a
father-son bonding thing.

Well, it doesn't
have to be.

Well, I don't know.
I'm not, like,
a camper guy,

you know, and I have
a show this weekend.
It's just...

Well, couldn't you
just reschedule that?

Sharon, it doesn't
really work that way.

How does it work?

Sharon.

Fine.
Forget I mentioned it.

Dude, I would
if I could.

I'm sure you would,
Sam, you're such
a selfless person.

Oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

Just forget it.

Now you're
all pissed at me.

Well, Jesus Christ, Sam,
I bail your ass out
on a regular basis...

No, you don't.
...and the one time...

Yes, I do.
And the one time,

the one time I
ask you for anything,

you act like I'm
sawing your arm off.

Oh, well, I'm sure sorry
that I'm such a
fucking burden.

You're not a burden, Sam.

You know what?
Forget it.
I will leave. Fine.

Sam.

(DOOR SHUTS)

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

You asshole.

OLIVER: Hey.
Hey.

Sucks about camping.

Yeah.

Hey, dude.
Come check this out.

(WOMEN MOANING)

Turn it down.

(VOLUME LOWERS)

Don't stand so close.

I'm not.

WOMAN: Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

(BANGING ON DOOR)
OLIVER: Uh...

Just a second.

Hi.

What do you want?

Just came up to hang.

What's going on?

Nothing.

Are you sure?

Yeah. Why?

Yeah.

You guys

weren't looking
at porn or anything,
were you?

No.
No. That's repulsive.

Yeah.
That's repulsive.

You little horndogs!

BOTH: We weren't.

Swear on your
mother's grave.

Come on, dude.

Pervert!
Shouldn't you be
looking for a job?

Shouldn't you be
looking for a job?

You know,

it's perfectly normal for you
little whippersnappers
to be interested in sex.

If I had the Internet
when I was your age,

I woulda never left
the frigging house.

But you gotta stay away from
sick shit like donkey fucking
and diaper fetishes.

Oh, and do not
start chatting online

with anyone who says
they're a
"14-year-old girl,"

'cause it's probably some
fat 50-year-old dude

who's gonna ass-rape you
and leave you for dead.

I'm serious, dude,
I saw it on Dateline.


Oh. By the way,

guess who's taking you
camping this weekend?

You gotta be
kidding.

Do I look like
the kidding type?

We leave the day
after tomorrow.

What if we don't
want to go
camping with you?

Hmm. Then I'd say,
"Tough shit,

"'cause we're going,
and it's gonna be
fucking fun."

Is my mom
making you
do this?

No.

I heard your
previous chaperone
fell through,

and I volunteered,
'cause I'm a nice guy.

Come on, dudes.

Camping action?
Men vs. nature?

Just don't be a dick
the whole time,
all right?

Moi?

A "D"?

So, you've got a cell phone
and warm clothes.

It gets really
cold out there.

Ollie, did you
pack your warm stuff?

Yes.
All right,
just checking.

And, Sam, you've got
all the maps, all my
telephone numbers,

water bottles...

What?

You're like a
frazzled soccer mom,
Sharon.

Stop, I'm just checking
so you guys
don't have to worry, huh?

Oh, thank you so much
for doing it.

It's fine. My show
got canceled,
so whatever.

Yeah. I knew you'd
see the light.

All right, dudes.
Let's hit it!

Oliver.

Be nice, huh?
I will.

Gentlemen.

Happy trails.

Bye.

(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

You guys keeping up
with the Mariners?

BOTH: No.

Right on.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)

Can we listen to
something else?

It lives! Thank God
you're alive. Wow!

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

"Slacknut"?
What the fuck,
is this shit?

It's hard-core
rock and roll. Just put it in.
You'll like it.

Jesus.

All right, Slacknut.

(HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Aw, fuck! Ew!


Shut up!
Gladly.

(MUSIC STOPS)
Jesus.

What are you...
Dude, that's my CD!
Listen!

That's my CD!

That shit
was not music.

That's your opinion,
you can't just...
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

Listen to me. I'm gonna
play you some real music.

And if you like it,
I will buy you the CD.

And if you don't like it.
I'm gonna have your
fucking head examined.

And if you still
don't like it
after that,

then I will buy you every
piece of shit fucking
Slacknut CD.

I will buy you the
monster box set.

Of course,
I will have to write you off
as a human being.

But I will replace
your CD. Deal?
Fine.

All right.

Now, first lesson, The Sonics.
Buckle your seat belt, dudes.

These guys paved
the fucking rock highway.

You're a psychopath.

Love you!
Shut up!

Love you!

SAM: Whoo-hoo!
 (BOSS HOSS PLAYING)

SAM: All right. I'm
gonna have the ham
and cheese omelet.

I will do rye toast and
a coffee, please, ma'am.

Okay, darling.

Thank you.
WAITRESS: You got it.

(DRUMMING ON TABLE)

Can I help you?

Why'd you order breakfast?
It's dinner.

Well, because I like breakfast
for dinner and that's
my thing. What's your thing?

My thing?

Yeah, what's your thing?
Like, what's your story?

What's your deal?
What are you into?

Is this some sort
of interrogation?

Uh, yeah.
You have a girlfriend?

No.

Yeah, you do.
Kaley McDowd.
Shut up.

Is she cute?

She's not my girlfriend.
She's in the Special Ed class.

You love Kaley McDowd.
No, I don't, Oliver.
And you know it.

Jake, dude, don't be ashamed,
man. I mean, we're all into
different things, you know.

Blondes, brunettes,
alterna-chicks...

I don't...
...bondage, fatties,
grannies...

I do not...
...midgets, barely legal.
Don't be ashamed of your love.

I don't love Kaley McDowd!
Everyone just says that

because I'm a class helper
in the Special Ed room.

Yeah, you like
to help Kaley McDowd
with anal sex.

No, I don't! I hate
Kaley McDowd!
She's handicapped!

Jake, don't be racist.

And, Oliver, we do not
talk about anal sex
at the dinner table, okay?

Hi.
WAITRESS: Okay.
Here are your drinks.

SAM: Thank you much.
Enjoy.

Do you have a girlfriend?

No.

She dumped him.

Uh, excuse me.
No, she did not dump me.

The relationship came to
its natural conclusion.

Dumped him. Kicked him out
of her apartment.

If it weren't for us,
he'd be a homeless
crack addict.

You know what?

Either shut up, or stick to a
conversation topic you
actually know something about,

like, uh, jerking off,

after-school detention,
whacking off,
masturbating your penis,

chocking the chicken,
slapping the clown...

You're so funny.
Oh, I'm so funny!
Yes, I'm so funny.

Oh, my God, stop!
You guy are
driving me nuts!

I know, he's driving me nuts!
God! Guy's crazy!

All right, dudes,
itinerary time.
Here we go.

Tonight, poker night
at the Ocean Spray Inn.

Hope you little dipshits
are excited, it's going to
fucking rule.

Tomorrow morning, we're up at
the ass-crack of dawn.
We drive up to the trailhead,

we unpack the car.
We hike down to the beach.
Set up camp.

Wake up the next morning.
Full day of hiking,
beachcombing,

all that other horseshit.
And then one more night
under the stars.

Assuming it's not, like,
pissing down raining.

And then we hike back
to the car. And drive
back to civilization.

Boo-ya!

Sounds boring.

Excuse me?
Yeah, I mean,

what are gonna
actually, like, do?

Did you not hear a word
of what I just said?
Are you deaf?

Walking around
on the beach and sleeping.
Sounds like fun.

You ungrateful
little bitches.

That's us.

(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

All right. So, the first thing
about poker is the hands.

(WATER SPLASHING)
You gotta know what beats what
in order to play, obviously.

But then once you get
the hands down,

it's all about mind-fucking
the other players. Oliver?

Oliver.
Huh?

Dude, you gotta listen
if this is gonna work.

I wanna go in the hot tub.

Yeah, me too.

Dudes, what the hell?

Just for a little while,
then we'll come
and play poker.

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

Ow, stop! God,
you're so, like, violent.
Shut up!

She's totally violent.

My friend's
a serial killer.
Shut up.

He murdered two little girls
in a hot tub last night.
And now he's on the run.

Oh, my God. Freaks.

God damn it.

(CHATTERING OUTSIDE)

Little players!

So, I threw it,
and it nailed her
in the face.

Gross!
And she had squid juice
all over her.

Oh, my God.
That's so mean.

Oh, did I hurt you guys?
I can't believe
you just did that.

Ow! Don't pinch me.
What are you doing?

Pinching me
like this.

I'm getting away from them.
They're crazy.

I can totally relate.
He's so impulsive.

What?

Nothing.

Hold out your hands.
But you can't look.

You can't look.
Put your head down.

You ready?

You can't look.
Put your head down.

SAM: What's up, studs?

Oh, hot shitballs!

SAM: So, how's it hanging?

Heard this party's
off the chain.

This is my cousin.

Hi. How's it going?

So, what's going on?
Are we doing truth or dare?

Seven minutes in heaven
or something?

I'm gonna go in the pool.
Yeah, me too.

Yeah.

I was kidding!

It was a joke!
Hello?

You can't take a joke?

All right, guys.
Chop, chop.

Poker time.

C'mon, let's hit it.

Guys.

Oliver Mitchell and
Jake whatever the fuck
your name is.

Guys!

Dude, you're gonna wake
the whole place up.

Well, you know, we got an
early morning tomorrow. And
if you want to play poker...

Okay, we'll be in
in a little bit.

I'm serious, 10 minutes.
Okay, Mother!

(SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)



Hey, it's Amy.
 Leave me a message
 after the beep. Thanks.

OLIVER: Sam.

Come on, wake up.
We have to go.


Come on,
let's go!


We slept late.
It's 9:00.
Come on.


Fuck off!

Let's go, dude.
Ow!

So, how far is
the trailhead from here?

An hour?

Two hours?

Five hours?

It's about five hours from
what the fuck do you care?

What?

You don't give a shit about
anyone but Oliver Mitchell.

So, what the fuck do you care
how far the trailhead is?

What's his problem?

Nothing, you guys just totally
ditched me last night.

We were getting
some action.

That and you were totally
cockblocking us.

Yeah.

Cockblocker.

Excuse me, but I kind of
thought we had a whole
poker night planned out.

Plans changed.

You're fucking weak, man,
that's all I'm saying.

I just think
you're jealous.

Hardly, okay?

I'm glad you guys had a
great time with the little
fucking girls in the pool.


But you know what?

From now on,

we're a team.

Please.

No, I'm serious.
I'm dead fucking serious.

This is a safety issue.

You got it?

Oliver.
Fine!

Jake.

We're a team.

Yay!

That's right.

Be quiet.

What are we
doing here?

Camping supplies.

I don't
like M-80s.

Don't be gay, Jake.
Yeah, don't be gay.

I'm not, I just
don't like them.

Greetings, ma'am.

We need Roman candles,

we need bottle rockets,
we need exploding shit.

We also need some
little granny sparklers for
our little gay friend here.

Shut up!

(ROCK SONG PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)

Hey, Jake, you got
a CD you wanna play?

I'm not gay 'cause
I don't like M-80s.

I know, dude,
I was just kidding.

SAM: I'm obviously safe
because I'm already
in my 30s,

but it's fucking creepy.
There's this plague that
hits them all in their 20s.

Like Jim Morrison, 27,
in the frigging tub.

Kurt Cobain, 27.

Um, let me see.

Jimi Hendrix, 26.

Janis Joplin, 27.

John Bonham. I think
he was, like, 30.

Um...
OLIVER: John Bonham was from
Led Zeppelin, right?

Yes. A-plus for you.

All right. Looking good,
gentlemen.

Aren't you
gonna wear
your hiking boots?

These are
my hiking boots.

Follow me, gentlemen.
I know the way.

SAM: You guys aware of

proper
shitting-in-the-woods
technique?

BOYS: What?

SAM: Are you aware of proper
shitting-in-the-woods
technique?

OLIVER: You gotta be kidding.

SAM: I'm not kidding,
I looked it up online.

Dude!

Let me hear it.
Do you know how to do it?

OLIVER: Do you get
any girls at all?

SAM: What do you think?
'Cause you act like a pig.

OLIVER: Seriously.

I don't get girls.

OLIVER: I know you don't.
I get women.

No, you don't.
You get girls. I get women.

JAKE: Oh, really?
SAM: Big difference.

So, is that why
you had to move
into Oliver's house?

JAKE: So, what base
did you get to?

With Ashley.

I touched her boob
when we were frenching.

What base is that?

Second, I think.

I touched
Cara's boob too.

Mostly by accident.

Ashley was hotter.

No, she wasn't.

Her boobs were bigger.

So what?

There's more to a woman
than her boobs.

How would you know?
You've never even
had a girlfriend.

Girls prefer gentlemen.

My sister told me.

So, why don't you go
have sex with your sister?

Don't be sick.

You're gonna have sex with
your sister and then your
penis is gonna fall off.

And then she's gonna put
your penis in a pickle jar
for a midnight snack.

Excuse me.

For your mom, dude.

All right, all right.
I got it.

Whoa! Whoa!
(OLIVER LAUGHING)

Uh, Jake...
Shut up!

Trail's over here if
you wanna get some...

Just shut up
and help me up.
Dude...

Roll over on your stomach
and push yourself up.

I can't!
Dude, yes you can. Come on.

No, I can't.
Now, will you just
help me up?

Oh, Jesus, you need to work
on your ruggedness, my man.

Don't touch me.

Dude, that was hilarious.

F you!

Whoa, Jake! Language!

You guys always gang up
on me and pick on me.

We do not!

Yes, you do.
And I'm sick of it!

Jake, where are you going?

Back to the car.

Will you stop being
such a drama queen?

I'm not being
a drama queen.

I've just had it with
you two Neanderthals.

Jake, we're sorry,
all right.

Just tell him you're sorry.
Dude, I didn't even
do anything.

Just tell him you're...

All right, Jake,
I'm sorry, dude.

Come back, man, we'll party,
it'll rule.

Seriously.

Don't leave me alone
with this little
dick breath, all right?

Dude.

Yeah, don't leave me with this
bastard shithead asshole.

Dickhead prick.

Fart licker.

He licks farts, Jake.

Yeah, I do.

SAM: (CLAPPING) Yeah! Jakey!

That's right, my boy.
Come on back.

SAM: I knew you had it
in you, soldier.

Come on.

Put 'em up, dog.

Right here.

Right there?
Right here.

Gimme a little something.

Come on.

You want to.

OLIVER: Don't be mad.
Well, that's cool.

You don't have to
do that 'cause, you can...
Oh, love it, Jakey.

(MAKING KISSING NOISES)

I love it! Kiss me!

How you guys doing?

You guys getting
any blisters or anything?

No, I'm good.
I'm good too.

You sure?
BOTH: Yeah.

All right.

You start to get tired,
let me know, and I'll tell
you to grow some balls.

OLIVER: Come on, Sam,
are we almost there?

SAM: Dude, I'm, like,
twice your age.
You're already tired?

OLIVER: I feel like
we've been walking forever.

SAM: We've been walking
for, like, 20 minutes.

Wuss! Wuss!
OLIVER: Shut up!

(INSECT BUZZING)

(INSECT BUZZING)

Come here.
Let's check the water.

Come on!

Yeah, I don't wanna
say anything like,
"I told you so."

Shit!

What?

Little chilly.
Not a problem.

JAKE: What are you doing?

Going in.

In your underwear?

No.

No way.

What?

You can't skinny dip here.
Why not?

I mean, it's the middle of
the day and
it's a public beach.

There's no one here.
Hello!

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

What, you guys
aren't going in?
Dude, it's freezing!

Jake.

Thank you. I'd rather not.

Fucking chicken shits, man.

Yes!

Love the smell
of the ocean, boys!

(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Whoa!

How's that for reception?

Hello?

Hey, Sam, it's JR.

Dude, what do you want?

Well, the short story
 is that Richard Kline

from Calamity Records is
 interested in meeting...
(LINE BREAKING)

Wait! Wait! What? What?

Richard Kline...
Wait! What?
JR! Hold on.

Hello?
I can't hear you.

Can you hear me?
Dude, I'm on a fucking beach,
I can't... Hello?

Hello?
I'm losing you. Hold on!

Sam?

Hello? JR!

Dudes! I just
got a record deal!

That's great.

Congratulations.
No, I'm serious, dude.

JR just called,
and Calamity called
and, like...

I didn't hear
the whole thing but, like,
I think I got it.

I'm serious.
Sweet.

Fuck. We gotta go back!

We just got here.

Ok, hold on. I'm just,
like, processing.

Fuck, I'm having
a heart attack.

Okay.

Dudes. This is it.

This is it, dude.
It's the moment.

The moment is here!

Yes!

See ya!

Wouldn't wanna be ya!

Boo-ya!

OLIVER: So, are you
gonna be on MTV?

Maybe, if they ever start
playing frigging music again.

Be pretty fucking cool,
though, right?

I admit that
would be
really cool.

(OWL HOOTS)

What was that?

SAM: A serial killer.

Shut up.

It's just an owl, dude.

But, you know, actually,
Washington State is famous
for its serial killers.

Ted Bundy, we've got
the Green River Killer,

we've got the
Hillside Strangler, who
was caught up in Bellingham.

So?

So, I'm just a little
concerned, that's all.

Concerned about what?

Uh, just all that shit that
happened here last March.

What happened here in March?

Oh, whatever. Come on,
you guys know, right?

No, I don't.

You're joking.
Oliver, you know, right?
Shut the hell up.

I'm serious, whatever.

We're sitting
around a campfire,

he's telling us a
scary story to
get us freaked out.

We're not
complete idiots.

Dude, if you don't want
to believe it, that's
totally fine with me.

Makes no difference.
OLIVER: Whatever.

Probably better
if you don't know.

Tell us.

Dude, it's no big deal,
all right, there was a family,

and they came up here to
go camping last March.

And they didn't come back.
Blah, blah, blah.
That whole thing.

What happened?
What? The murder
weapon or what?

They were murdered?
Yeah, brutally.

Yeah, it was a whole family.
It was a mom and dad,
and, uh,

two boys and a girl.
And they were murdered
and mutilated.

It's weird, actually, when
the police found their bodies,
the killer, had, like,

sliced open their cheeks from
mouth to ear and kind of,
like, pulled their faces up

in like a frozen scream.

Sick!
Yeah, totally sick.

Did they catch the killer?

No, I don't think so.

But it's not like
the murders were right here.

It was two or three miles
up the beach, so...

That's still pretty close.

Yeah. Guess it's
all relative.

That's bullshit, dude.

Dude, I'm just reporting
the facts as they are.

Come on, if it was true,
we would have heard
about it in the news

or something, or read it
in the papers.
I read tons of stuff about it.

How else would I know
so many details?

Mmm.
Yummy.

(OWL HOOTS)

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

(SAM SCREAMS)

(BOYS SCREAM)

Oh, no, guys. It's me.
It's just Sam. I was
just fucking around.

I didn't see...
I'm sorry, okay.

SAM: I didn't see anything!

Get off me, fag!

Where are you going?

Fuck you.

Jake!



Jake!

Oliver!

Guys!

If you can hear me,
meet me at the tent!

Oh, what the fuck, man?
Where have you been?
Where's Jake?

I don't know.

You don't know?
That's great!

You know, for once I would
appreciate it if you guys
could be, like, mature adults

instead of these
itty-bitty
fucking babies.

I gotta change
your diapers
every five minutes.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about you and
your little boyfriend.

He's not my boyfriend.

Well, whatever, all right.
But you know,
he's a fucking baby.

You played a
stupid joke on him!

Me? This is my fault?
Yes!

Oh! Oh! I'm sure sorry
I forced you guys to have

a little gay make-out party
last night. What the fuck
was I thinking?

Look, I'm sorry. Oliver...
You're a prick.

I'm sorry, all right.
I'm stressed out.
Just leave me alone.

Dude, I can't leave you alone.
I'm in charge of you, okay?

You're not in charge
of anything.
You're a fucking loser.

What?
You are a loser!

You know what?
Why don't you go rendezvous
with your little lover boy?

Fuck you!
Well, fuck you more,
you spoiled little shit!

All right. (SIGHS)
I'm worried.

I think we should
go look for him.

Maybe he got mad,
and, like,

tried to walk to the car
or something.
I don't know, but...

All right,
do what you want,
but I'm going.

Good call.

Jake!

Jake!

Jake!


Hey, check it out.

Oh, shit.
What's wrong?

Hippies.
Stay close.

SAM: Hi.

Hey.
'Sup, man?

Hey, um, we're looking
for a friend of ours.

He's, like, a curly-haired,
14-year-old skinny kid. Yeah.

He's got, like,
a blue shirt on, shorts.

Um, I'm...

I, um...
I don't know...

Have you seen
anybody today?

Yeah.
You have?

Think I saw
somebody moving

to the left.

Yeah.
Back there?

Like, on a... Like,
when you say to the left,
like, he turned...

On the trail,
onto another little trail.

That way?
Where you came from?

Yeah.
Are you sure
you didn't. I mean...

I'm wearing a blue T-shirt.

Are you sure it wasn't me?
I'm not. I'm not sure.

Okay, do you remember by
any chance, what trail it was?
It's kind of important

'cause he's missing, and
he may be lost.
So, we're trying to find him.

If you could help us...

MAN: Um...

We're trying to
let things go while
we're here on this trail.

Or...
You know what?

If you see him, will you
just not let him out of
your sight for me?

Maybe.

MAN: It's hard not to...
Let's go.

Yeah.
Okay, thank you.

Yeah, brother.
See you guys later.

See you.

Good luck.
SAM: Thank you.

OLIVER: Maybe
they did see him.
SAM: Maybe they did.

That's the problem
with hippies.
Unreliable fucking witnesses.

Well, I know Jake
brought a blue shirt.

Here we go. Side trail.
Now what do we do?

I don't know.
Yeah, well, neither do I.

Thank you,
hippie assholes!
Fuck!

SAM: Well, this sucks.

OLIVER: This super-sucks.

Kinda sucks worse
than being stung in
the eyeball by a bee.

This sucks worse than
drinking a dog shit milkshake.

than walrus sodomy.

This sucks worse
than making out
with a razorblade.

sucks worse than falling off
the Empire State Building

and getting your scrotum
caught on a rusty nail.

Yeah, no.
That sucks more.

I don't know, dude.
This sucks pretty
fucking bad.

Are we lost?

Uh, we are lost-ish.

Oliver, wait up.
What the fuck?

We're in the...
We're, like, fucking nowhere.
What is this shit?

Jake! Jake!
Where the fuck
are you?

Oh, what the fuck?

Oh, shit.

Why'd you get
so many sparklers?

Got them for
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

Why do you hate Jake?
I don't hate him.

Then why are you
always so mean to him?

He's just one
of those kids.
Easy target.

Do you think
he's gay?
I don't know.

Are you homophobic?
No.

I think you are.

Why did you
just say that?

'Cause I think
you're homophobic.

Well, that's funny because
I think you're homophobic.
Maybe I am.

Well, maybe you're an asshole.
Maybe I am.

Well, then, maybe you
should feel real proud.
I do.

You know, you used
to be, like, this sweet kid.

When did you become this,
like, aggro frat boy?

What are you gonna do?
Kick my...
Oliver!

Oliver! Get back here!
Oliver!
Don't touch me!

Get back here,
Oliver!

Ow! Fuck!

You just hit me!

Fuck!

Yay. The river.
Fucking again. Whoo!

Wanna just move here?
We can go down this way.

It's not that steep.
I don't know about that.

Oh, fuck!
Oliver!

Shit! You okay?
Yeah.

Shit. Okay.

Let me help you up.
Come here. Give me this.

Here.

Here. Put your knee up.
So you can stand.
Hold on.

I can't use my ankle!
Okay, okay. All right.

All right.

All right, dude,
you're gonna be fine.
It's fine.

All right. Plan "B,"
dude. Here.

Oliver?

Sam?

Guys? Hello?

Ow, ow, ow.
Wait, hold on.

What?
Fuck this. Dude,
I'm just gonna carry you.

I'm way too heavy.
Oliver, it's getting dark.
It's cold.

I'm too heavy, Sam!
Oliver! Put this on.

Give me your arm.

Hop on and shut up.

All right.
Light as a feather.

WOMAN: Come here, Oscar!

Sorry, brother.

Hey, brother,
mind if we join you?

Sure.

Hey, have you guys
seen a man and
a kid around here?

No, man. I mean,
that's kinda
hard to say.

Did you say
a man and a kid?

Yeah.

Like, a taller dude
and a little dude.

Yeah.

Everything is coming
together right now.

How cold does it get
out here?

Cold. Don't worry about it.

What if we
freeze to death?

Oliver, we're not
going to freeze to death.
Shut up with the freaky shit.

All right?

OLIVER: Should we build
a fire here?
SAM: No way.

Don't they say if you're
lost in the woods to stay put?

I don't know.
I've never been
lost in the woods.

We're screwed.

Oliver, we're
not screwed.
Yes, we are.

Look, I have a plan.

We're gonna forge
a bow and arrow
out of that tree,

and kill us up
a good-sized Sasquatch.
Suck on the meat.

We'll wrap ourselves up
in the bloody hide
for warmth. All good.

We're definitely screwed.

Look, I'm gonna get us
back to the campsite.
That's all there is to it.

So, just shut up.

We're not gonna sit here
twiddling out thumbs
around a campfire

while Jake's
missing, either.

What do you mean,
Spaceship Earth?

I mean, this is
a vessel, man.
That's all.

And you and me,
we're just passengers.

Do you know about
the seven states
of consciousness?

Ow!

Wanna rest?

Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.


Oh, fuck.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

You cold?
Yeah, it's fucking freezing.

Let's talk about
something else.

Uh, so, what
instruments
do you play?

Uh, guitar, bass,
little bit of drums,

shitty piano,

bad-ass tambourine,
definitely.

You know how
to play anything?

Nothing.

No shit.

Dude, you gotta play
a little guitar or something.

Nah, I don't.

It will get you laid.
Kind of important.

Um, not a music guy.

I could teach you.
No, it's okay.

Listen, I'm sorry about
that shit I said
about you and Jake today.

It was really
fucking stupid.

It's okay.

No, it's not.

I'm an asshole.
And it's not okay.

Sometimes.

You're a good friend to Jake.

He's been my
best friend since

third grade.

I don't know
what's wrong with me.

It's not your fault.

Yeah, um, it is.

All right.
We should get a move on.

You ready?
Yeah.

Fucking freezing.
All right.


(OLIVER COUGHING)

(SAM GRUNTING)

Uh, shit.
That's our last one.

All right.

Go as far as I can.

We're on the
edge of the Earth.

And us,

we're pioneers, man.

We're on a waterbed.

Well, that's exactly
what we're on.

We're on a waterbed.

SAM: Ah, shit. All right.
I should've worn
fucking hiking boots.

Got it.

Get the whole thing.

All right.
We're gonna take
a little rest.

Dad.

No, it's Sam.

I was dreaming.

All right.
Go to sleep.
It's okay.


Oh, fuck.
Okay. All right.

Oliver.
Yeah.

Okay, you ready?
You ready?


Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

Here we go.

(HUMMING IRON MAN)

* Has he lost his mind?

* Can he see or is he blind?


* Can he walk and talk?

Fuck it!

* Can he see or is...

* He blind?

* Can he walk and talk

All right. Come on.
Come on, here we go.
Come on up.

Come on.
Here we go.
Here we go.

Fuck! (GRUNTS)


I can't.

I can't do it.
I can't do it.

I'm sorry.


(WAVES CRASHING)

(SEAGULLS CALLING)

You hear that?

Oliver, check it.
Listen.

(PLAYING DIDGERIDOO)

Sorry.

Wasn't me.


Gross.

Hey, I'm sorry
I called you a fag.

Nice.
Hey.

Yo.

Are you gonna tell
my mom what happened?

Uh, let's see.

You went for
a walk on the beach.

I went looking for you,
I got everybody lost.

And...

I don't know.
That's pretty much
what happened, right?

I guess.

So, you know,
the whole, like,

girls or boys thing,
it's, like,

totally normal.

You're gonna
iron it out.

(INDIE FOLK SONG PLAYING)

Look, I know, all right.
I know. You don't have
to say anything.

What is there to say?

I'm just grateful
no one's dead.

Yeah, it's not
for lack of trying.

You know, Sam. Actually,
it sounds to me like you
might have saved his life.

That's a very generous
spin on things, but...

Yo! What's up, dudes?
MAN: Hey, Sam.

How's it going?
Hey, guys. How you doing?
It's good.

So, uh, here's the deal.
Okay.

Before we get
all into that stuff.
I just want to take a second.

Kinda just want to apologize
to you guys for my behavior

as of late.
I haven't really been,
like, a team player.

And like, I know that, and
I just want to say I'm sorry.

You know.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, okay, um...

What we didn't tell you is
that Marcel and Chad and I

have been working
on a side project
for about a year now.

Wait, what?
Yeah, and we didn't...

We didn't tell you
because we didn't want to
freak you out needlessly,

but that's the demo that
Kline's calling about.

It's a totally
different direction.

Fleetwood Mac, kinda,
you know, coke pop, Tusk.

And the vibe hasn't
been great lately.

You know?

Just not
feeling it, man.

Just not
feeling it, man.

OLIVER: Where are
you going?

Think I'm gonna stay with
my friend Casey for a bit.

Did you get
a record deal?

No. They kicked me
out of the band.

Yeah.

But it's...
It's cool, I...

Yeah.

You could start a new band.

Yeah, maybe.

I don't know.
In the long run, though,

I might be more like
a music fan than like
a musician, you know.

You could work
in a record shop.

definitely not for me.

It was just
a suggestion.

So, I don't know what kind
of plans you have this summer
or whatever, but,

you know, if you wanna,
like, hang or something.

Yeah.

Uh, see you around?

Definitely.

Um...

I have something
stupid for you.

Found this on the beach.

It's a sea urchin.

There was a bunch of
shitty broken ones, um,

but this one was, like,

whole.

Well, all right, duder.

I'll see you
'round the bend.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Bye.

Bye.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: Action!

These are my hiking boots.

Fuck hiking boots.

Where we're going,
we don't need hiking boots.

Oh, these are my hiking boots.

These are my hiking boots.

Who the fuck
needs hiking boots?

MAN: (LAUGHING) Cut! Cut!
