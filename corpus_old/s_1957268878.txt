[Veronica] <i>Get your hands off the radio!</i>
[Junior chuckling] <i>What?</i>

[Veronica] <i>I want to play something. Stop! No!
Oh, God, no.</i>

[Veronica] <i>I want to turn it up. Please!
It's my radio!</i>

[Junior chuckling]
<i>God, you're such a shit!</i>

watch the road! Watch the road!</i>

[Junior] <i>Stop! Wait!</i>
[horn blaring]

[screaming] <i>No!</i>
[tires screeching]

[loud crashing]

[radio continues playing]

<i>Veronica...</i>

<i>Veronica?</i>

[blinkers ticking]

[Junior sobbing]
<i>Veronica!</i>

["Uh Oh!"
by Super Water Sympathy playing]

Morning, V.

Today...

I'm a three.

Which is good,
yesterday was like a six.

<i>â™ª In comes the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lift up the flight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Swallow the key â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do not know why â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Solar flares now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Holy war rounds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Polar shift pounds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No more good towns â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll sound alarms â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The warning sign â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The signal flare â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Chasing the lights â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Send the ship south â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In the storm clouds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From a beach locked
in a dark town â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! This town's on fire â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hello, I hear the choir â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I build your funeral pyre â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whisper to me something
that your heart desires â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

[dial tone]

[phone rings]

Hey.
[Junior] <i>Hey, Care Bear.</i>

Can we do a quick
packing check, please?


<i>Clothes?</i>
Check.

Toothbrush? Bathroom stuff?

That is very vague, but check.

Meds?
Check.

Everything you need
for Portland?

Check.
Sounds like you've got everything.

That's the worst
packing check ever.

Do you have all
of your diabetic accoutrements?

Of course.
What about your paperwork for South Dakota?

Uh, yeah. Junior,
it's fine. Don't worry.

I'm just preparing.
I know, Polar Bear.

Just... get in the shower and
I'll be there in a bit, okay?

Okay, bye.

<i>â™ª ...that your heart desires â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>
[Mads] Thanks, Sam.

<i>â™ª Soon we will be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh oh! Oh no! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Soon we will be expired â™ª</i>

Uh, hey, hon.
Mm-hmm.

I thought we talked
about downsizing?

I did... [chuckles]

You seriously just
going to watch me?

I don't want to waste
my arms on this.

If you want me
to drive too, I can't.

Alright, what else
do you need in the back seat?

Hmm, the record player?
You got your keys?

Okay.
[keys jangle]

[upbeat rock music]

[horn honking]

Okay, okay. We have been on the road now for two hours...
[radio switches off]

...and I haven't heard
any of Veronica's songs!

Okay, only because
it's Veronica's stuff.

["You Us Hey"
by Super Water Sympathy playing]

See?
[chuckles]

I mean, I like that smile on your face.
[chuckles]

That's pretty dope.

It's good, it's...
[chuckles]

[singing along] <i>â™ª I sit and watch these people go to see â™ª</i>
[chuckles]

<i>â™ª A love that's soulless
not for us, we don't care â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make it work, polarize

<i>â™ª Keep it cool, you us hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll keep your ring

<i>â™ª Take off my clothes

<i>â™ª Market shares

<i>â™ª We don't care, stay up late
all the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We don't tire, you us hey â™ª</i>

What is that?
I don't know! [chuckles]

<i>It's a little poppy for me.</i>

<i>Don't give me diabetes again
with your music.</i>

So, I'm sorry,
how does diabetes work?

Sh... should I just
turn the car around?

fall asleep when you started...

[snores]
...but, no, I'm really interested.

Why don't you just
get it renewed online?

I don't know! Just the way
I've always done it.

Well, why don't you have
a California driver's license?

Because it seems like
a lot of paperwork?

I think I'd be embarrassed to have
a South Dakota driver's license.

Just saying!
Aw, that's really sweet.

Hey, what are you doing?
You're driving. Go!

Ugh!
Go!

[phone rings]
Wait, hold on. Just give me a second, okay?

Hey, what's up?
[Miles] <i>Hey.</i>

Did you talk to her?
<i>No, but...</i>

No, dude, don't... don't call me...
<i>I just want...</i>

...unless you actually talk to her, okay?
<i>Alright, fine.</i>

<i>Alright, talk to you later.</i>
Alright.

Alright, you ready?
Yeah.

Alright, let's go!

Who you talking to?
[Mads] Uh... I was just talking to my brother.

So, I... I found the ice,

and I could barely
touch the bottom,

and... I hit
my head on something,

so I don't really
remember what happened,

but... somehow
my friend pulled me out.

So, I guess I died...

But I guess it just never really occurred
to me to tell my parents about it.

Isn't it weird how things just aren't a
big deal, if you don't acknowledge it?

Like when a kid hits its head and you
laugh so it doesn't cry and freak out.

Yes, exactly. Exactly.

You know, I think I was kind
of that way after my surgery,

I was, like,
in so much physical pain,

but I was just completely casual
about how I was suffering.

It was like
the mental anguish was enough,

that I didn't know how to...

like, deal
with my physical pain,

so I just, like, didn't
acknowledge it. [chuckles]

I just put it in a box,
put it to the side,

didn't think about it,
said, "I'll talk to you later."

You can deal with pain for, like, 30 seconds.
Yeah.

Like anyone, any kind of pain.

But then 30 seconds
becomes 30 minutes,

and then... 30 minutes
becomes a month,

and then a month becomes...
years later.

I have no idea why we started
talking about my pain.

I'm sorry.
Dude, don't apologize.

I mean, look at you.
You're driving.

Your pain can suck it.

Yeah, suck it.
[chuckles]

I never told my parents I knew they
weren't in love with each other.

Shit, woman.

[blows raspberry] If that's not
the first line of your memoir.

["Sirens" by Hydrogen Child]

Alright, let me go over, assholes. You have to get over.
I'm trying!

[Junior] <i>Get over!</i>
<i>God, stop yelling at me...</i>

I'm not...
...you're like the worst fucking nav system ever.

Let me over, dick cheese.
Stop it, can you...

No, hold on!
[Mads] No, you hold on.

Jesus Christ!
[Junior] Fuck!

[horn blaring]
[Mads] Shut up, shut up, shut up.

You're from LA, I thought
you were a better driver.

I'm just highly aggressive.

That's the LA driving way.

Did you ever see that movie <i>Leaving
Las Vegas,</i> with Nicolas Cage?

The one where he gets, like,
blackout drunk the whole time?

It's a little... more nuanced
than that, but yeah.

I just think we shouldn't do
a Nicolas Cage in Vegas.

worse than, like, hungover driving.

We have to find
a perfect balance, okay?

Of, uh,
dulling all of these senses

and still being able
to get in this vehicle tomorrow,

drive and not throw up everywhere.
[laughs] Yeah!

I can do that.
Well, guess what? You are in luck,

because I am the expert at that.
[gasps]

How?
I took a class.

road trip we planned,</i>

Vegas scares me the most.
Isn't that depressing?

Even more than Portland?

I think Portland is going to be,
like, mental pain, I guess,

but physical pain.
[chuckles]

You know, it's...
it's electric, it's alive.

The lights, the money,
the people.

All my nerves,
they start going like that.

You know, there's other hotels.
We don't have to stay here.

Oh, I didn't say
I wanted to skip it.

It was just letting you know.
Alright, well,

let's get to dulling
those senses then!

[Junior] Oh!
<i>â™ª Bring on the sirens â™ª</i>

Truth, dare. Truth, dare.

Truth, dare.
Dare to... dare, truth!

Okay, if all of this
can't handle all of that,

then we just come back and we
enjoy the pretty lights, deal?

Deal.
Seal it with a drink.

[gasps] Oh! Oh!
Oh!

[gargles]
Don't chug it, jeez!

[intense techno music]

I'm from LA!
[man] What?

I have a chronic pain disorder.

Totally.


You can't see my pain.
It makes me really lonely.

[man] Sagittarius.
[chuckles]

[music dies down]

[light moaning]

I have diabetes!

A-bada-deesh-ada-bam!

Humm ashabe!

[Junior chuckles]
<i>Bye, Sagittarius!</i>

[Junior and Mads laugh]

Oh, my God!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Alright.

Uh, truth or dare? [chuckles]

Dare.
You always pick dare!

Duh...
Okay, fine!

How about...

I dare you to piss in the sink.

[both laugh]

Okay!
No, dude!

So gross!
I mean, I got to pee, so...

I already said I could do it,
you're not supposed to do it!

[laughing hysterically]
Oh, my God!

Yep. Watch this. Oh!

Oh!
Oh, Jun, are you okay?

I have a romper on!
Well, that's part of why I dared you!

Is because I could say, "Hers was a dare!"
You say... [laughs]

[both laugh]

I can't feel pain!
[laughs hysterically]

[soft trickling]

I can't feel pain.

Is this... is this what...

is this what other
people feel like?

And their lives, like,
all the time, pain-free?

Okay... yeah...

Your turn, truth or dare?

Truth, because I don't want to move.
[groans]

Tell me a secret.

Okay, what are we, five?

Yes.
[laughs]

Ugh, okay.

A secret.

Okay, I...

I don't think that my mom left
because I got sick.

I think she left
because I was never going to be

Miss Teen Supreme, pageant...

I think that I got sick,
and that was, like,

the final straw that broke
the camel's back or something.

I don't know.
You really think that?

Does it really matter? Stop!
I'm sorry.

What... stop! No, don't pet me! Stop!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Stop! [chuckles]
You're so fucking sad.

Yeah, okay. Truth or dare?

I'm sorry your mom was dumb.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Truth or dare?

Truth.
Alright, okay.

The big spoon.
Make it a really good one.

Mm.
Okay!

It's going to be
a really intense truth.

Are you ready?
Yeah.

It's so super deep.
Mm-hmm.

Did you ever truly believe in unicorns?
[chuckles]


[horns honking]

Fuck.

Oh, my God.

[traffic humming]

Oh, f... shit.

We did not just fall asleep...

Fucking tub.

Oh, God.
[bones cracking]

[groans]
Oh...

Oh, Junior...
Oh, balls.

Oh, my God.

Oh, you have to call a crane.

they have that service here.

No, I don't want to.

[retching and coughing]

I'm still drunk! [chuckles]

<i>To the Salt Flats.</i>

<i>What the hell are Salt Flats?</i>

<i>Really? It's a Veronica stop.</i>

Are we growing?

We're always growing.

I used to think that.

I feel stagnant.

Alright, well, maybe you're
not growing right this minute,

but that's because you're
hungover with your face in salt.

Ah... Fuck.

Oh, God.


Why do we keep
hurting ourselves?

Because it feels
really good at the time.

What else is there
but feeling good at the time?

Well, I don't know
about you, but...

I feel pretty good right now.

Apart from being
super dehydrated.





Cheers, V.

Ready?
Mm-hmm.

Okay.

[background chattering]

Oh, there we go. Okay.
Oh, I need that bed.

But... I like to be
near the bathroom.

I can't be by the air.

Oh, that's right. Okay.

Thanks.
No, it's no problem.

I like all the large homeless men to
be able to see me. I need to get some.

I think maybe you should
close the blinds.

Oh, no. It takes all the fun out of it.
Okay.

Oh, holy shit.
Oh, my God. What?

You know it's
a classy-ass establishment,

when the name is on the towel.
[laughs]

You take me to all the best places.
Oh, you know it, sugar.

[chuckles]
I'm so lucky.

Alright, I am ordering pizza.

Really?
Oh, it's fine.

I'll just tell
my robot pancreas to suck it.

Okay.

Hi! Yeah, can I get, um,

a medium pepperoni pizza,
with extra cheese?

Yeah, we are at the,
uh, Lazy Lodge.

Alright, thanks. Bye.

Thirty minutes.
Cool.

So, when was the last time
you were actually home?

Uh... four years?

Four years, so you mean...

the last time you needed
a driver's license renewed?

Oh, look at you. You're quick.

[chuckles]
Mama didn't raise no dummy here.

Hey, Care Bear.
Hey, hey.

You okay?
Yeah, that pizza was just too much,

so I got to get the insulin

Regulate.
[chuckles] Yeah.

Text me if you need me, okay?

Thanks. I'll be in in a bit.

Yeah, I'm going to be

[birds chirping]


High? Higher? Highest?

[Mads chuckles]
High-ish.

[beeping]
[Junior] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Does that hurt?

It feels like a really
thick exfoliant on a sunburn.

Oh, God!
Yeah.

Hey, so listen. I printed out some maps...
Ooh. You printed out maps?

Of course I did. We may not
always have phones, and...

Uh... [chuckles]

We'll be fine, okay? [chuckles]

I mean, I'm sure we will be, but it could happen, you know?
Okay!

And so anyway,
I marked points of interest,

because I really want to go to
the library in Salt Lake City.

They have these huge windows and all...
No, hold on, look. Okay.

Is this a Veronica stop?

I mean, not specifically.

Well, then no, dude!

Your arms
can handle more than that.

They just handled Vegas!

You can handle
more than libraries.

<i>More Than Libraries,</i>
that's the name of my next album.

Ooh! Besides, if we're
going through Salt Lake,

we have to see
the victim of the beast.

That sounds very dangerous.
It is.

[sighs] Did you take it?
Have to act more dead.

[camera shutter clicks]

Got it.
[both laugh]

Veronica would have
liked this stop.

[birds chirping]

Wah! [laughs]
[screams]

[breathes deeply]
Good.

I'm going to get you,
Emily Rose.

Oh, I'd like to see you try,
Linda Blair.

[Junior] Oh, God.
[chuckles]

[engine rumbles]

what's with the shot glasses?</i>

When Veronica was on tour,
she thought it was this cool idea,

to leave just this little piece of her everywhere she went.
Hmm.

So, I thought I could carry that tradition on for her.
Cool, I like that.

What song...

would you play at your funeral?

"Life Is a Cabaret."
[blows raspberry]

That actually doesn't shock me at all about you.
Yeah?

You're like a drag queen
on the inside.

[gasps] That's the best compliment I've ever got.
[laughs]

I do feel like there's a drag queen inside me.
It's a good compliment!

It is a good compliment.
You're like an inner showgirl.

I can see you, like, in your casket
with, like, a boa around you...

Pshaw!
...with, like, glitter. [chuckles] I love it.

Can I ask
that same question to you?

Uh, "Feelin' Alright"
by Joe Cocker.

[chuckles] I mean, but...
Irony. I'm dead.

But you're not feel... I mean, I would think...
I'm not feeling anything.

Which is feeling alright to me.

Alright, a way to take it down there, Junior.
[chuckles] Oh.

I think we're going to have the best funerals ever.
Right?

Well, let's not get dead today, okay?
Yeah, no, no, no, not today.

I'll drive safe,
I'll drive safe.

Okay. Now, remember, we need
sustenance, and we're on a budget.

Yes, Mom, but I'm going to go pee first.
Have fun!

[checkout printer buzzes]

Now, do here.

[packets crinkling]
You pay?

There.
Thank you.



[phone buzzes]


Thank you.
You need anything else?

No, I'm good.
Okay!

[blows raspberry]

Who put the fucking toilet
so far away

from the goddamn trash can?



Oh... [groans]

Fuck, fucking hands.

Okay.

[sighs loudly]


[music intensifies]

[stutters nervously] Did it.

[phone buzzes]

Hey!

What did you find out?

Yeah.

Okay. Well, I mean,
do it, I guess.

I mean, what choice do we have?

Yeah... Hey, I got to go.

I'm sorry. I...
I just... I got to go.

Alright. Bye.

Hey!

What you doing?
Just work stuff.

Thanks for tampon.
[chuckles] No problem.

[Mads laughing]
It's just so stupid!

it's the perfect time!

[stereo plays]

No, dude. You take my good mood,
and this is what you do with it?

One more time!
Ugh, fine.

I think we can get it.
I think I can get it this time.

Alright. [stutters] Sh... show me.
If I get it, will you get...

If I get it right,
can I have an ice cream cone?

You want a drink?

Cousins or, like, uncles?

No, no.
What?

to get that on this trip,

okay? This isn't
the kind of thing,

where you're going to meet,
like, 12 cousins and uncles

and see, like, baby bath pictures
when I was five. It's just my grandma.

God, I don't know what it's like
to be unchained from family.

Not that I need chains to be
with my family, they're great,

but it must feel bizarre to
feel not responsible to anyone.

But you're not responsible.
You don't have any kids.

I have parents, old parents.

Yeah, but you're
not responsible for them.

But I am. They took care of me.

I mean, after the accident,
I had to move back in with my parents,

and I was almost 30 years old.

They were mourning
the loss of their daughter,

and their other daughter.

[mellow background music]

I was a grown-ass woman,
they didn't have to take care of me.

But they did.

They were really great.
And when the doctors

didn't believe my pain,
they did.

They said, "Junior, don't worry.
We'll find you another doctor."

And they never gave up.

And yet I still
have the weirdest fear

of not being believed.

Because existing in that space
of not knowing fucking sucks.

Yeah.

Well, your parents are
very different from my parents.

I want to be a little honest about something.
Shoot.

I'm kind of jealous of you...
[chuckles]

...because you have
this recognizable disease.

I know it's really gross to say.
No, no, no.

It's the alcohol.
I get it. I get it.

Human nature, grass is always greener, all that.
Yeah.

But, hey, at least you
didn't do that to yourself.

I mean...
Now, this...

That I think I did to myself.
Mm-mm.

Pretty sure
this isn't helping me.

Hell, no.

Fuck positivity!

Cheers to that.
Cheers.

Another round, Doran.
You bet, coming up.

[birds chirping]

you can see, like, on my finger,

like, little tiny pinpricks.
It's like a little...

little, uh, pin cushion.

My stomach's a big pin cushion,

and my fingers are
like little pin cushions, but...

That's a heck of a routine.

Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

What's your routine?
I have to take my pills.

And it's... there's a lot of them.
Yeah.

[pillbox rattles]

Shit, girl.
That's... that's my daily pills.

They're huge.
Thank you.

And I'm going to have to take some pain pills too.
Ah, jeez.

I'm going to need
some breakfast,

or I'm going to throw
all of these pills up.

It's a good idea. I'll go get you an omelet.
Yeah.

to get to the school bus.</i>

<i>That's what I had to do.</i>
[Junior] <i>Oh, my God.</i>

[Mads] <i>You want to know the weird part?
What?</i>

left and my dad died,</i>

<i>I used to live with my grandma,
and I kind of missed it.</i>

<i>Weird thought, maybe you just missed your family?</i>
[Mads scoffs] <i>Maybe.</i>

[birds chirping]

[car beeps]

Hate to break it to you, hon,
but I think we're walking from here.

Come on.

Yay!
[chuckles] Yeah.

I love walking.
"Yay" is right.

I need to get my stuff. Hold on.
Alright.

[chain rattles]

[birds chirping]

[water lapping]

[Junior] You can tell this place used to be pretty.
[chuckles]

Please don't make this
another metaphor for your body.

It's a close fit.
[chuckles]


Over there, that's where
my brother used to take me

in his revved up Camaro
and we did doughnuts.

Oh, I loved it!


I look forward to meeting him.


being back here.

[birds chirping]

This is where you almost died?

Yeah, it's...

so much bigger than I remember.

I mean, it used to be a creek,
and... and when it was frozen,

you could barely
see underneath it.

Man, if I were you, I would have so
made out with that boy that saved me.

Scary.

It's definitely pleasant.

I think it's the definition of the word "pleasant."
That it is.

I don't think I could do it
all the time, though.

I definitely couldn't live here.

The way people don't want
to live in California

because of the constant sun.

Too much of a good thing...
...is a better thing.

Uh-huh.

I'm the same age now
as my mom was when she left.

Shit.

Time is dumb. I mean,
according to social norms,

I should have a kid
in high school by now.

Instead, I can barely
hold a toothbrush.

[birds chirping]

My body hurts.

I need a fucking joint.

I don't really want to get high.

I just want the pain to go away.

Well, hey, enjoy it.
I have to pee.

Alright.
Enjoy nature and shit.

[crickets chirping]

Bet you never thought
you'd see South Dakota.

Miss you.

[grass rustles]

[grass rustles]

[grass rustles]

[soft thud]

[soft thud]

[box rattles]

What you doing?

I buried this
when I was a teenager.

Can't believe it's still here.

I can't believe you remembered
where you buried it.

A watch?

A watch my mom gave me.

Oh... I...

Alright, let's motor.

[grass rustles]

[Junior sighs] <i>Oh,
I got to get in the back seat.</i>

<i>I got to stretch out.</i>
[Mads] <i>Dude, just wait till we stop.</i>

[Junior] <i>No, it hurts now. It hurts now.</i>
[Mads] <i>That's not safe.</i>

Is that a cow?
Is that a cow? It's brown!

I thought cows
were black and white.

Well, that's racist.

I've only seen them on my plate,
and they're delicious.

Hey, did I ever tell you
the cow story?

What cow story?
Oh, one minute it was, like, getting dark,

and my mom was driving,
and there was just a cow

standing
in the middle of the road.

I was really young and there
was, like, six of us in the car.

I think we were coming back
from, like, a movie or something.

And she hit it, right?
And it goes right up on the windshield.

And I go under the dash
and break my arm,

and she goes under the windshield
and she's pulling out, like,

shards of glass for the next
two years, it was crazy.

That's the most Midwestern story
I've ever heard in my life.

tell me about it.

[engine rumbles]

[door unlocks]

Okay, here we are.

I love that they have keys.
[chuckles]

I have to lay down.

Okay.
All that farm walking.

My knee hurts.
Alright, lay down.

I'll go get
the rest of the stuff.

[mechanical clunking]

[phone rings]

Hey, Miles.
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

What happened?
<i>I called the number back.</i>

Yeah?
<i>It was a Vermont number.</i>

Vermont?

That doesn't make any sense.

<i>I know.</i>
Okay?

<i>I found Mom.</i>

Shit.

<i>I booked us
flights from Portland,</i>

<i>so hurry up and get here, okay?</i>

Okay.

Okay, I know your period

but what's your number?


Number seven.
I cannot make it to Grandma's.

How late did you stay up after
I went to sleep last night?

[groans and mumbles]

So, you just decided
to keep drinking?

No.

I don't need your judgment.

I just needed
the pain to stop, okay?

No, I'm not judging.
It just... [sighs]

It just seems
counterproductive, is all.

Well, you're one to talk, pizza bitch.
Hey!

There's no need to name-call.
I'm just trying to get us going.

God.

o'clock to walk 13 blocks to church,

and then I walk home
17 blocks to my apartment.

And then the rest of the day,
we go to a movie

or just do some shopping,
or we go out to eat.

I'm glad you're staying active.
I have to be busy.

Yeah. So, uh...

I went
to the old farm yesterday.

Been so many years.
I... it has been.

You know,
when Mom left, she, uh...

She left me something of yours.

And I hid it.

I don't know why I just...

I just did and, um...

I, uh... back
when I was at the farm, I...

I dug it up.

I'm just... I think
you should have it back.

This is from my mother...

for my birthday, one year.

Sorry, grandma.

So good to have it back.

I've been thinking about
this watch for so long, and...

I don't need it anymore
because...

Miles found Mom.

And I think
I want to go see her.

I miss my daughter.

I hope she's nice to you,
and I hope she realizes

what a precious gift she has,

because you are
just a precious gift.

And look, you were...

more than a mom to me,
in the few years that you took care of me.

I just need to know why.
I need to know what happened,

what she was thinking.

I just... I just
need to understand.

[soft melancholic music]

I love you, grandma.

Thank you.


Thank you for everything.

I love you so much.

[door opens]

Hey.
Hey.

How was grandma's?
Uh, it... it was fine.

It was fine. Uh...
Good.

Alright, you ready?
Yes.

Let's get it over with.
Yeah, DMV.

Okay... [chuckles]
Then Portland.

Portland! Yeah.
Yeah.

Okay.

I got it, bitch!

Good!
Let's go to Portland!

Portland!
Yes! [shrieks]

[Miles] Hey!

There she is!
How have you been? What is this situation?

Um, well, I shaved it off, um...
Oh, God!

Look at you.
Ugh...

This is Junior.
Hi.

Junior, nice
to finally meet you.

Oh, I can't really shake,
but a hug?

That's right. Yeah,
I forgot about the... the arms.

I heard all about them.
Yeah, I have arms.

No, I mean,
she told me all about the...

Issues?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's not uncomfortable.
[chuckles]

I have complex regional
pain syndrome, type two.

Yeah.

Congratulations? [chuckles]

Thank you.
Yeah.

Mads has diabetes.

I do?

Yeah.
[sighs] This is huge!

Alright. Make yourself at home.
Whatever you guys want, um...

Throw your stuff anywhere.

Drinks?

Fuck, man. I can't believe
you live in this place.

I mean, you are adulting
so good. Like, too good.

What is it you do for a living?

Software engineer.

Oh.

What about you?
What do you do, Junior?

I survive.
[chuckles]

Okay, she's being dramatic.

She writes greeting cards.

[Miles] Oh, neat.
[Junior] Mm.

I'm a struggling writer
with the funk hands.

How poetic.
Indeed... [sighs]

I mean, what is life
without some struggle?

No... [chuckles]
Oh, so they're nihilistic greeting cards.

It's a big market for that.

It's huge. It's huge,
I'm really rich.


Hey, thanks
for letting us stay here.

This is a really bitching place.

You guys are always welcome.

Plus, I would do anything in the
world for this little water egg.


I'm not so little anymore.

[soft rumbling]

I think she cried herself
to sleep last night.

I don't know how I can look her in the eye
and tell her, she's going to be heartbroken.

You two are honest
with each other, right?

Mostly.

What have you told her?

Nothing.
Mads...

I know, I know.
You know what? You're avoiding.

I'm avoiding, I get it.
Thank you.

I mean, I'm just...

I mean, she's only heard me
bitch about Mom, you know?

Like that, "My mom left me,
so she's worse than your mom."

All that stuff.

I don't think she's going to get
why I need to see her.

Okay, what's the story
with the arms?

Alright.

She and her sister were taking, like,
a road trip from LA to Portland.

Like a sister vacation thing.

And... they got into a car
accident, and her sister died.

And Junior,
she broke a bunch of bones

and had to have
surgery on her arms,

and... [sighs]

...that resulted in this
chronic pain disorder and...

chronic pain, something,
something syndrome.

She... she calls it CRPS.

Fuck.
Yeah.

[door creaks]

I was also driving that car.

Uh, morning! I just... I was
telling Miles about your arms.

You know, that's weird brunch conversation.
Yeah, yeah.

Do you want
some death with your eggs?

Maybe some chronic pain?
Just coffee.

Oof, I like coffee.

You got it.
Thanks.

So, how did you sleep?

Surprisingly well.
On the floor?

I know, weird.
Body hurts a little bit,

but I don't know.

You have good floors.
I'm sure you say that to all the boys.

Ah, it's like
he knows me already.

So anyway... [chuckles]
I know there's a lot of things

you want to do in Portland,
uh, but I have to grab a shower.

[rolls tongue]
Wash this messy hair, so...

[sighs] Thank God.
[chuckles] Yeah.

So, Portland.
How long have you lived here?

The city's been good to me.

What about you?
Your first visit?

Technically, yes. That... that whole car
wreck thing she was telling you about.

My sister and I
were on our way to Portland.

She was really obsessed with
this city and wanted to see it.

We didn't quite make it.

I'm kind of here for her.

Wait, that wasn't
your question, um...

To answer your question, yes.
This is my first time here.

Yeah.

I'm sorry about your sister.

I can't imagine losing Mads.

Yeah, Mads is special.
She's been a really good friend to me.

You raised her right.
Oh, we raised each other.

I'm only five years older.
Only?

Veronica and I were
five years apart. I was older.

We had great parents and
I still feel like I raised her.

You know, I think it's just
this older sibling thing.

You know what I mean?
Yeah. Yeah.

Responsibility's kind
of driven into us, huh?

Exactly.

Hey, um, Junior?

You aren't even
in the shower yet!

Yeah, I know. Um, can I talk
to you in the bedroom?

Tampon situation?
No! That's all you, babe.

Excuse me.

What's up, Care Bear?

Well... [sighs]

Okay, um...


Oh...

I didn't know you were looking for her.
Miles did the looking.

Where is she?
Vermont.

Vermont? Why is she in Vermont?
I don't know.

Do you have family in Vermont?
I don't know.

[exhales deeply]
Miles thinks that I need to face her.

And so, he... he booked
a plane ticket, and...

I'm going to go see her.

Wow. M... Mads, that's huge.

When are you going?

Tomorrow, at noon.

What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

Junior, I'm sorry.
We're 1,000 miles from LA, Mads!

Junior, I know that.
I know that. I'm so sorry.

I just... [stutters]
Why can't you wait till we get back to LA,

then go to Vermont?
I get it. But look, I know you think my jobs are stupid.

Okay? But...
but I need them to pay my bills,

and I can't get
any more time off.

that's bullshit, but...

[tense music]

It's now or never.
Okay? Because...

if I don't do it now,
I never will.

And I need to know why,
okay? It...

It's the same as this trip for you and
Veronica. You know, you have to heal...

It is not the same!
Yes, it is! Okay? It doesn't matter

the catalyst for hurting,
the healing is the same.

Ugh, I don't want your fortune cookie
shit, save it for your mommy.

Oh, Junior, come on! Stop!
I know this sucks,

but why are you
so mad at me about this?

Because you're abandoning me,
when I need you the most!

This whole trip
has been about you!

I didn't even go to the library,
because of you!

What library?
In Salt Lake City.

Oh... [stutters] I... I didn't get
that that meant so much to you,

I'm sorry.
Whatever. You're just like everybody else.

Everybody who? Who else?
And you can't say your parents.

Oh, you're one to talk, little girl.
[stutters and sighs]

Look, Junior. I think that you use
me as a crutch. You don't need me.

I didn't know Veronica,
and maybe...

and maybe it makes more sense
that you do this alone.

I can't believe you're turning this around
like, "Oh, it's a great idea to do it alone."

It has nothing to do with your selfish agenda!
My selfish agenda?

This has to do with my mom,
who's alive, by the way.

Bring it back in, Mads.
No, don't.

She's acting like a child.
So are you.

Whose side are you on?

Don't do that, alright?
You sound like Mom right now.

Are you just going to swing from left to
right on the pendulum, just like that?

Look, I think
you should apologize, okay?

Don't you?
[sighs]

No, Junior, just stop. Stop, okay? Wait.
Nope.

[door shuts]
What, you're just going to let her leave?

Obviously she needs to cool off.

If I go after her,

we're just going to yell
at each other.

She just...
needs her alone time.

Yeah, don't we all.

[music fades]

I never even got a phone call.

Why aren't you
more angry about that?

Because I don't care.

Alright? She left me
when I was a grown-ass man.

I wasn't a teenager like you.

I knew from the moment
that she put us in that car

that one night,
to go chase after, uh...

What was his n... the guy with the... Tony.
The guy... Tony.

With that ugly red hat he wears around.
[stutters] Yes!

Oh, my God. What did it say?
It had something about, like...

[laughing] Konkey Donk on it or something.
I... it was some bar, or some...

I don't know.
Oh, God. Oh, I hated that hat.

Yeah, I knew way back then that
she would never put us first.

It was always going to be her.

I'm glad you decided to do this.

Just... be prepared
to be disappointed.


She's not texting me back.

I assume this is
your biggest fight ever, huh?

Yeah.

It'll be okay.

I hope so.
[door unlocks]

Junior, I... I am so sorry.
Uh-uh.

I have a question.

O... okay.


Shoot.


Did you know in South Dakota?

How could you know
in South Dakota?

How could you travel
1,200 miles with me,

just sitting next to me,
knowing you were about to dump me?

It's not like that, okay?
It's not... like I said,

I didn't know that that Miles
was going to go look for her.

I didn't know that he was going to find her and...
I just thought our friendship,

and our relationship
as friends was past you lying.

I don't know who you are.
Okay, at the beginning of the trip,

I didn't know any of this
was going to happen, okay?

But now that it has,
I have to try.

I need... I need
to look her in the eyes, okay?

I need to ask her why,
and I need to just...

I need to yell at her.
I need to get out of this...

this in-between place between
being a teenager, an adult

and wherever I am, okay?

that space that you were in,

where...
when you were being diagnosed,

those two years where you had
all those unanswered questions.

I haven't seen
this woman for ten years,

and I've had ten years
of unanswered questions.

I can't believe you're going to
minimize my own pain and suffering,

just to justify your own. That's gross!
No...

No, that's... [groans] I don't...
that's not what I'm saying, okay?

That's not... I'm get...
this is coming out all wrong.

I don't mean to minimize
what you're going through, okay?

I just... [sighs]

I wouldn't have been able to
do this three years ago, okay?

I wouldn't have been able to even
talk to that woman, much less see her.

Okay? I can't imagine
what you go through,

and you have to be
so strong to do what you do

on a day-to-day basis, and...

have been able to do this without you.

Mads...

I don't want
to stand in your way.

I just don't know
why you have to abandon me.

I'm not abandoning you.

You don't need me.

I know that you think you do,
but you don't.

You're right.


You're just a kid.

Wow.

Okay.

[soft melancholic music]

[door slams]



I don't want to get in
the middle of this thing, but...

I just know that Mads is trying.

Alright? This isn't
an easy decision for her and...

And to be honest,
I pushed her to make it.

So if you're going to be mad at
someone, don't just be mad at her.

Why does it have to happen now?

I went to South Dakota,
South Dakota!

She promised me that drive home.

You realize now I have to drive
that road where my sister died.

I have to do that alone.

And you're scared?
Of course I am.

So is she.

Can you not see that?

Has Mads ever talked to you
about her fear of not being seen?

It started after she got sick.
She said to me, "I'm invisible.

This disease
makes people not see me."

Yeah, I know that feeling.

And then her mom left.

And ever since, Mads has been
spending her life trying to be seen,

but stay invisible
at the same time.

She can't stay there anymore.

Does that makes sense?

Of course, it does.

Guess it's time
for us both to grow up.

I don't... I don't
want to be rude, um...

I really have to lay down.
Yeah.

Uh, all the arguing,
the walking,

it really makes
my pain levels go up.

If you wouldn't mind to.
Yeah.

Thanks.



Do you want some pot
or something?

Yeah. Yeah.

Yes. Yes.
[chuckles]

Yes!

I don't fault you for that.

I just wish
you hadn't lied to me.

No, I know. I...

I don't know why I did,
I guess...

I was just scared.

I don't know,
maybe you're right.

Maybe I don't need you.

Maybe I'm too dependent on you.

I think I used you
as an excuse to do this trip,

instead of Veronica
being the whole reason.

Okay, so are we good? Or...

I don't know, Mads.
I think I need some time.

What does that mean?
It means I need time.

I got to go.
Got a long way to drive.

I'll see you later, Mads.

Bye, Junior.

<i>â™ª I used to wander around â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like autumn leaves
rustling on the ground â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Trying to find my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Through this empty place â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like thunder crashing
without a sound â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know it's hard to say
I know I lost my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And, oh, it's such a shame it
took so long to feel this way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I didn't believe
just where I could be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I'd only seen that
you were right in front of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes you have
to close your eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To find your way back home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes you have
to close the blinds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To see just where to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you're alone
on the road â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Falling down just move
along â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes when love
is on your mind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You have to close your eyes â™ª</i>

[waves crashing]

<i>â™ª The stars above
are never gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Even as the night</i>
<i>loses light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Into the dawn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And all the shapes
of the moon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They can change
they can move â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the sun always shines
in the dead of the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know it's hard to say
I know I lost my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And, oh, it's such a shame it
took so long to feel this way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I didn't believe
just where I could be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I'd only seen that
you were right in front of me â™ª</i>

Hi, Polar Bear.

Hey, Care Bear.

<i>I'm here.</i>

<i>â™ª Falling down just move along â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes you have

<i>â™ª To find your way back home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes you have
to close the blinds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To see just where to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you're alone
on the road â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Falling down
just move along â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sometimes when love
is on your mind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You have to close your eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª St. Lucia â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, I am the beach â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So keep your cool
on the rain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll scream "Goodbye" to you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As I say "Hello" to the moon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You smell so sweet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where your ears
and your shoulders meet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You smell so sweet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where your ears
and your shoulders, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let me sink my teeth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where they meet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll scream "Goodbye" to you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As I say "Hello" to the moon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You smell so sweet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where your ears
and your shoulders meet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You smell so sweet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where your ears
and your shoulders, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Meet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where they meet â™ª</i>
