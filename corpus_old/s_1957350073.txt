Radio Announcer: 
At the pips,

the local time 
will be 12:00 noon.

[ beeping ]

This is the Bahamas 
Radio Network,

Saturday, 
September the 12th.

[ sniffs ]

NO!

GOOD MORNING,
MRS. DRISCOLL.

I NEED ANOTHER PATCH-UP.

YOU'RE TROUBLE, ARNO.

COQUINA.

HELLO, ARNO.

MY GOD.
LOOK AT YOU,

WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

YOU JUST DISAPPEARED
3 YEARS AGO.

THAT'LL BE $3.00
UP FRONT.

I WAS SENT
TO MY UNCLE'S SAIL SHOP

ON WISHBONE CAY.

TO GROW UP BEFORE
SHE WENT FURTHER

WITH
THE LIKES OF YOU.

10 YEARS OLDER.
HUMPH.

WHO SELLS
BEACH JUNK.

I'M JUST
A RUGGED CAPITALIST.

THERE ARE PLENTY
OF YOUNG MEN HERE

WHO WOULD--
BORE YOU TO DEATH.

STILL
THE JOKER.

HOW'S DOROTHY?

JEALOUS AS EVER.

AND YOU?

STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT KISS.

COQUINA, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE CHEMIST'S

BEFORE HE CLOSES.

WANT TO WALK
WITH ME?

I HAVE TO GET
HER LAUDANUM,

OR ELSE
SHE CAN'T SLEEP.

$3.00, ARNO.

WE DON'T TAKE IOUs.

GRANDMA DRISCOLL

DOESN'T
LIKE ME MUCH.

AFRAID NOT.

WHY NOT?

I'M A MAN
OF SUCH CHARM,

IMAGINATION,
SELF-RELIANCE.

A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
BEACHCOMBER.

Man:
GOOD DAY TO YOU,
COQUINA.

HELLO, THOMAS.

ARNO.

HOW'S THE HOUSE
COMING ALONG?

OH, FINE AND DANDY,
THANKS.

ROOF'S ALMOST DONE.

DO YOU WANT 
TO GO WITH ME?

SURE.

Arno:
GRANDMA'S
KIND OF GUY.

"A FINE UPSTANDING
SHOPKEEPER

WHO CAN TAKE OVER
THE SAIL BUSINESS."

SHE'S LOOKING OUT
FOR ME.

I'M THE ONLY FAMILY
SHE'S GOT.

SO YOU STAY
FOR GRANDMA'S SAKE?

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THERE'S NO PLACE BETTER.

THAT'S BECAUSE

YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
ANYPLACE ELSE.

YOU HAVE,
AND YET YOU STAY.

WHY?

TO AVOID MONEY,

POSSESSIONS,

PREDATORY WOMEN.

AH, BUT WHAT IF

I SHOULD FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU?

OH, ARNO.
YOU HARDLY KNOW ME...

OR ME, YOU.

WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

MORE THAN GLAD.

SEE YOU AGAIN?

ALL RIGHT.

Man:
HEY! ARNO!

HELLO, JEAN-PIERRE.

COME ABOARD HERE.

THERE'S SOMEONE
LOOKING FOR YOU.

CAN'T. DOROTHY'S AT HOME
WAITING FOR ME.

ARNO.
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.

BIG MONEY.

BIG SURPRISES,
LIKE LAST TIME?

NO, NO. HEY, AMIGO,

WE TOOK CARE OF THAT
FOR YOU, EH?

NO. THIS TIME,
GUARANTEED.

NO BAD SURPRISES.

I THOUGHT JEAN-PIERRE
DID YOUR ERRANDS FOR YOU.

I HAVE A CHARTER.

ANOTHER RICH BITCH 
FROM MIAMI?

NOBODY KNOWS THE WATERS
OFF OF CUBA LIKE YOU.

CUBA?!

NO, THANKS.

HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
COME ON. WHOA, WHOA.

LISTEN.
YOU NEED MONEY, RIGHT?

$500 UP FRONT.

MONEY? ME? THE MAN
WHO'S GOT EVERYTHING?

COME ON. DON'T MAKE
ME LAUGH, EH?

LISTEN.
WITH ME, YOU GET.

WHAT I GET IS MY ASS
IN A WRINGER, LIKE LAST TIME.

ARNO. PLEASE.

LISTEN TO ME.

I DON'T LIKE ANYBODY
TURNING ME DOWN.

I DON'T LIKE DIRTY JOBS
OR DIRTY MONEY.

MATTER OF FACT,

I'M NOT TOO CRAZY
ABOUT YOU, EITHER.

BUT-- HEY!

I TAKE CARE OF HIM?

NO, NO, NO. I NEED
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

CACA'SGOT
A SHALLOW DRAFT.

ARNO'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS THE WATERS

AROUND MORRO CASTLE.

I'LL FIND A WAY.

[ people chattering ]

YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
ARNO?

YOU'VE GOT STYLE.

YEAH?

HOW SO?

WELL, YOU GAVE ME
THE PRESENT AFTER,

NOT BEFORE.

[ laughs ]

WELL,
MAYBE IT'S A MEMENTO.

ALL THE BETTER.

ISN'T IT NICE
THAT YOU HAVE ME

FOR YOUR LOVE LIFE?

OH, YOU'RE
NOT MY LOVE LIFE.

YOU'RE MY SEX LIFE.

AND YOUR LOVE LIFE?

JANINE...

WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET IT TOGETHER.

MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

MY SEX LIFE'S
GOTTA GO.

WHAT?

LET'S END IT PRETTY.

SO IT'S GOODBYE...

JUST LIKE THAT?

YOU'D DO THE SAME THING
TO ME IN TIME.

I WAS JUST SOMETHING
THAT WASHED UP ON THE BEACH?

YEAH.

A PIECE OF TREASURE
FROM JEAN PIERRE'S BOAT.

NOW I'M RETURNING IT.

SCAVENGER.

[ music and singing ]

HIYA, WILLIE.

HOW ARE THE NOTES
FALLING?

Woman:
HEY, ARNO.

HEARD THAT PRETTY BIRD'S
FLEW BACK.

OH, WORD TRAVELS PRETTY
DAMN FAST, DON'T IT?

MAMA GETS IT FASTER
THAN WESTERN UNION.

SAME AS ALWAYS?

YEAH.

THANK GOD I WON'T 
HAVE TO HEAR YOU

MOANING ABOUT THAT GIRL
NO MORE.

I GOT ANY MAIL,
MAMA?

I GOT YOUR BAR BILL.

ANY WAY I CAN GET
A COUPLE MORE WEEKS?

HMM.

ON THE HOUSE.

WELL, I MAY STILL
BE MOANING, MAMA.

SEE, THEY DON'T GO
FOR US PELICANS

OVER ON PIRATE CAYE.

OH, YOU'LL HANDLE
THEM, ARNO.

JUST LIKE YOU'LL
HANDLE MY BAR BILL.

GOTTA GO.

NICE WATCH.

MY OLD MAN'S.

HE HAD GOOD TASTE.

GOOD TASTE AND BAD LUCK.

SET ONE UP ON MY TAB.

WELL,
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

LICK THE SALT,
DOWN THE TEQUILA,

SQUEEZE THE LIME,
AND ENJOY THE DAY.

JIM.

I NEED THIS PELICAN ARNO
TO SNEAK INTO MORRO CASTLE

AND GET ME THREE GUYS
THAT HAVE NO PAPERS.

SO?

SO HE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO.

SO NA--

NAIL HIM ON SOMETHING
AND MAKE HIM GO.

AH, AND FOR MY TROUBLE?

WELL, THESE GUYS
ARE GOOD PAY.

UH, WE COULD, UH...

SPLIT FIVE THOU.

WHY NOT TEN?

OKAY.

HOW YOU GONNA DO IT?

WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME
I CALLED IN A MARKER, EH?

Arno:
DOROTHY?

I'M HOME.

MISS ME?

[ bird squawks ]

COME HERE,
YOU LITTLE CRYBABY.

AH, I BROUGHT YOU
A BISCUIT.

[ bird squawks ]

SO, DOROTHY,

I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS--

YOU LISTENING?

DOES SHE LOVE ME?

HMM? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

HMM?

YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

[ organ playing ]

[ church bell ringing ]

Thomas:
WELL, IF IT AIN'T
ARNO.

GETTING TO BE
QUITE A VISITOR.

[ church bell continues ]

Man:
TELL US-- ON THOSE
DESERTED CAYS--

YOU EVER FIND
A MERMAID?

Man #2:
HEY, ARNO, HOW DO YOU
DO IT WITH A MERMAID?

[ laughing ]

TELL YOU WHAT, ARNO.

WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK
DOWN ONTO YOUR BOAT THERE

AND FIND YOURSELF
A MERMAID?

WELL, I'LL TELL YOU HOW
I DO IT WITH A MERMAID.

I GO RIGHT UP TO HER
AND I SAY,

"HONEY, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
FLIPPER.

WHY, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A PRETTIER FLIPPER THAN THAT."

UNH--!

[ Thomas coughing
and sputtering ]

Man #1:
TOM... ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

GET OFF ME!

Arno:
SO WHY WOULD
A BLOODTHIRSTY PIRATE

LIKE DEAD-EYE DRISCOLL
SETTLE DOWN HERE ANYWAY?

THE WOMAN WHO OWNED
THE SAIL SHOP TAMED HIM.

AND THAT WOULD BE
YOUR, WHAT?

GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-
GREAT-GREAT--

[ laughs ]
YES.

IS THE SAIL SHOP
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

THERE ARE OTHER PLACES
WHERE THERE'S MORE TO LIFE.

LIKE?

LIKE PARIS,
FOR INSTANCE.

WHAT WOULD I DO THERE?

OH, TAKE A CARRIAGE RIDE
THROUGH THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE

WHEN THE CHESTNUT TREES
ARE IN BLOOM.

SLEEP AT THE RITZ
AND WAKE UP TO THE SMELL

OF CROISSANTS
AND CAFE AU LAIT
IN THE MORNING.

YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT?

NO.
I KNOW ABOUT IT.

I THOUGHT YOU
WERE HAPPY HERE.

AH...

I DON'T THINK
THE WELCOME MAT
WILL EVER BE OUT

FOR A PELICAN LIKE ME.

MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON.

MY MOTHER
LOVED IT HERE.

MY FATHER HATED IT.

HE EVER COMING BACK?

NO.

HE WANTED MORE
OUT OF LIFE...

TO TRAVEL
AND SEE THINGS...

MONEY.

HIS PIRATE BLOOD,
I GUESS.

ANY IN YOU?

MAYBE.

LET ME SEE.

PIRATE BLOOD,
ALL RIGHT.

[ engine cranks ]

[ engine starts ]

[ ship's horn sounds ]

AHOY THERE!

WANT TO MAKE
A SMALL RUN?

DEPENDS.

IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

MR. GAVOTTE
WANTS TO SEE YOU.

LOUIE GAVOTTE?

YES, SIR.

PRIDE OF CHICAGO,
ALL RIGHT.

OH, MALCOLM.

I NEED SOME OF MY BIG STUFF
FOR TONIGHT'S BASH.

IS MRS. OFANSKI
WEARING HER DIAMONDS?

YES, MADAM.

THEN I'LL DO
MY EMERALDS.

YES, MADAM.
IN A MOMENT, MADAM.

WHO ARE YOU?

THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS
PAST, MADAM.

HMM.

YOU GOING TO BIMINI?

YEAH.

GUY NAMED ROY MALONE,
BARCLAY'S BANK,

GIVE HIM THIS.

TELL HIM LOUIE LEAVES
FOR JAMAICA TOMORROW

AND HE WANTS THE STUFF.

LOUIE PAYS ON DELIVERY.

GOT THAT?

YEAH.

MALCOLM, HAVE HIM
WRITE IT DOWN.

I SAID, I GOT IT.

BETTER HAVE.

KNOCKIN' WITH TWO.

OH!OH!

[ chuckles ]

ONE OTHER THING.

MRS. GAVOTTE
HAS SOMETHING.

[ door opens ]

[ knock on door frame ]

COME IN, MALCOLM.

HERE'S SOMEONE WHO WILL
MAKE THE RUN, MADAM.

YOU'RE GOING TO BIMINI?

YES, MA'AM.

WILL YOU BRING SOMETHING
FROM THERE FOR ME?

IT'S JUST A PACKET 
OF MEDICATION.

I HAVE PAIN.

WHEN DO
YOU NEED IT?

TONIGHT.

WHERE WILL WE BE,
MALCOLM?

OFF MORGAN CAY,
I THINK, MADAM.

IT'S QUITE--

IT'S QUITE LIVELY HERE
AT NIGHT.

THERE'S CHAMPAGNE
AND MUSIC.

THE CHEF IS
FROM THE LIBERTE.

THANKS, BUT, UH, I DON'T
THINK I HAVE THE WARDROBE.

PLEASE.

ALL RIGHT.

JUST CALL-- CALL
THAT NUMBER AND--

EXCUSE ME.

YOU WILL BRING MY PACKET,
WON'T YOU?

IF I SAY I'LL BRING IT,
I'LL BRING IT.

I'M SORRY.

I'M JUST SO UNUSED
TO PEOPLE KEEPING THEIR WORD.

[ thunder ]

LOOKS LIKE
WEATHER TONIGHT.

AFTER MIDNIGHT,
THEY SAY.

GOOD DAY.

HELLO, MALCOLM HERE.

THIS SHOULD SQUARE US.

I GOT THAT PELICAN ARNO
ABOARD, ALL RIGHT.

WELL DONE, MALCOLM.

THAT MAKES US EVEN...

JUST ABOUT.

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

YOU HAVE A PACKAGE
FOR MRS. GAVOTTE?

NICE TALKING TO YOU.

[ engine starts ]

[ gun clicks ]

WHAT WOULD A NICE
PELICAN LIKE YOU

BE DOING IN
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

GIVE ME THE PACKAGE.

IT'S FOR A SICK WOMAN.

GIVE IT TO ME!

DAMN, AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

LUCKY I SAW HIM COMING.

NASTY PART OF TOWN
FOR A MAN TO BE ALONE.

[ dog barking ]

NEXT TIME YOU COME
IN MY TERRITORY,

LET ME KNOW.

OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

WORD WAS
THE ARMY KILLED YOU.

MY FRIENDS GAVE ME
A VERY NICE FUNERAL.

THE ARMY
STOPPED LOOKING.

THAT GUY BELONGS
TO SERGEANT MAJOR JIM.

YEAH.

GOOD OLD JIM.

YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP
HIM IN FRONT OF YOU.

HE DO ENJOY SHOOTIN'
PEOPLE IN THE BACK.

YEAH, WELL,
RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE

I'M BEING LINED UP
FOR TARGET PRACTICE.

[ thunder ]

BETTER GET UNDER COVER.

YEAH.

ARNO.

[ band plays fast foxtrot ]

â™ª YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB,
YOU'RE FACIN' JAIL â™ª

â™ª YOUR MONEY'S GONE,
YOU CAN'T MAKE BAIL... â™ª

[ thunder ]

â™ª YOUR BANK ACCOUNT'S
GONE UP IN SMOKE... â™ª

Janine:
I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE
WANTS TO DANCE WITH YOU.

REALLY?

TELL ME, DARLING,

DO YOU EVER GET
TIRED OF THE CHASE?

ONE CONQUEST
AFTER ANOTHER?

HMM.

Jean-Pierre:
AND YOU, MY SWEET?

WHAT ABOUT ME?

THIS BRACELET
ON YOUR WRIST.

I DON'T RECALL
SEEING THIS.

LADIES LIKE TO RECEIVE
PRESENTS.

NOT THAT YOU WOULD KNOW.

MMM. NO.

THESE LADIES 
GET ME, HMM?

HMM?

THIS IS MORE
THAN ENOUGH.

â™ª ...YOUR PULSE IS LOW,
YOUR PRESSURE'S HIGH â™ª

â™ª AND AS DISASTERS
MULTIPLY â™ª

â™ª WHY PULL THE COVERS UP
AND HIDE IN BED? â™ª

[ thunder, heavy rainfall ]

SCOTCH, SODA.

[ thunder ]

ARNO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

Arno:
THERE'S A STORM
BREWING OUTSIDE.

NO, IT WAS
MORE THAN A STORM.

YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW, MY DEAR.

Janine:
OH, ARNO,

YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
FOR A LADY'S EGO.

WOULD YOU EXCUSE US,
SEÃ‘ORA?

LAST CHANCE, 
ARNO.

$2,000.
$1,000 NOW...

$1,000 WHEN YOU
COME BACK.

THE ANSWER'S
STILL NO.

WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU?
YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY?

I LIKE MONEY FINE.

I JUST DON'T LIKE
YOUR MONEY.

SO IF I KISS THE EAR
OF THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE,

WILL SHE SCREAM?

YES.

â™ª WHEN THINGS
UPSET YOU â™ª

â™ª DRESS UP
AND GO TO TOWN â™ª

â™ª WHEN YOU'VE GOT
TROUBLE... â™ª

Jean-Pierre:
NO, DON'T SCREAM.

[ music stops,
Governor's wife gasps ]

[ Jean-Pierre laughs ]

Bandleader:
2... 3... 4...
[ music resumes ]

â™ª DON'T LET IT GET YOU â™ª

â™ª DON'T LET IT
GET YOU DOWN â™ª

â™ª WHEN THINGS UPSET YOU

â™ª DRESS UP
AND GO TO TOWN â™ª

â™ª WHEN YOU'VE
GOT TROUBLES â™ª

â™ª YOU CAN'T
WORRY THEM AWAY â™ª

[ thunder ]

â™ª WHY BREAK OUT
IN A SWEAT? â™ª

â™ª JUST TELL THEM
WITH REGRET... â™ª

Sergeant Major Jim:
ARNO, MY FRIEND,
A WORD.

SO SORRY, JANINE.

I'LL HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT BOX, IF YOU PLEASE.

YOU'LL HAVE TO
TAKE IT FROM ME.

NOW THIS LOOKS
LIKE HEROIN.

OH, ARNO, YOU ARE
IN POSSESSION

OF A HIGHLY ILLEGAL
SUBSTANCE.

YOU'RE IN DEEP
TROUBLE, MY FRIEND.

Ortega:
NO, NO, NO, NO.

PLEASE.
ALLOW ME, PLEASE.

ONE MOMENT.

ARNO, I WANT TO BE YOUR
FRIEND IN THIS TROUBLE.

I WILL PAY YOUR BAIL.

DO YOU A FAVOR.

SURE. THEN I'D DO YOU
A LITTLE FAVOR...

IN CUBA, RIGHT?

WHAT YOU WANT?

A LOT OF JAIL TIME,
OR A--

[ whispering ]
A LITTLE BOAT TRIP?

[ music stops ]

Woman:
OH! THERE'S A KNIFE!

AAH!

JEFE! JEFE!

JEFE! JEFE!

Woman:
HE'S DEAD!

Man:
HE'S DEAD.

[ thunder ]

[ engine starts ]

[ gunshots ]

AW...

DAMN IT.

UNH! UNH!

[ coughing ]

[ squawks ]

Radio Announcer: 
The Fidelity Insurance Company

has begun to search 
for "The Pride of Chicago."

Fidelity has 
a $10-million policy

on the luxury yacht 
and its contents,

which include 
$1 million in gold,

in addition to a collection 
of fine art and antiques.

The ship is equipped 
with a holding safe,

made to Fidelity's 
specifications.

IF YOU FOUND THE GOLD
ON THAT SHIP...

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO MAKE LOVE

WITH ALL THOSE
CHARTER LADIES.

I DON'T MAKE LOVE
WITH THEM.

I MAKE BUSINESS
WITH THEM.

I GIVE THEM
MY SERVICE.

[ laughing ]

"BUSINESS"? 
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT.

[ music plays on radio ]

MMM.

I DON'T KISS
ANYONE LIKE THIS...

[ continues in French ]

Hmm?
[ chuckles ]

[ church bell tolls ]

[ sighs ] 
OUI...

MMM!

[ crying ]

[ Bahamian dance music plays ]

YOU KNOW THAT HOUSE
I'M FIXING?

MM-HMM.

MY FATHER SAYS
IT CAN BE MINE.

THAT'S NICE.

WHEN I TAKE A WIFE.

I'M HUNGRY.

SHH.

I NEED YOUR HELP.

WHAT?

I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING,

BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

I HAVE TO GET
SOME THINGS--

A CROWBAR,
A SLEDGEHAMMER,

A DIVE SUIT,
AIR PUMP.

WHAT FOR?

I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

IT'S IMPORTANT.
REALLY IMPORTANT.

YOU GOTTA HELP ME,
COQUINA.

I DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

I'M STARVING.
COME ON.

[ music continues ]

Coquina:
THIS IS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

THIS IS THE RICHARDSONS'.

WE'LL BRING
THE STUFF BACK.

[ door creaks open ]

ANYBODY THERE?

DAD, ARE YOU THERE?

WHO'S THERE?

THOMAS...

I WONDERED
WHERE YOU HAD GONE.

I-- GONE? I DIDN'T
GO ANYWHERE.

I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

W-WELL, W-WELL,
I THOUGHT YOU HAD LEFT

AND THAT IT MIGHT
BE NICE

FOR US TO BE ALONE.

OH, YEAH,
RIGHT, UH...

PEOPLE AROUND.

IT'S JUST
YOU'VE BEEN

WITH THAT ARNO
FELLA SO MUCH,

I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK THAT...

MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT ME...

THOMAS.

THE WAY THAT
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

BUT THEN, UH...

HERE YOU ARE.

IT'S NICE
AND COZY HERE.

THOMAS--

MIGHT HAVE US
A LITTLE BANG.

THOMAS, NO--
AAH! AAH!

HEY! UNH!

Arno:
BANG, BANG.

[ Thomas groans ]

LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

[ Thomas moans ]

YOU COULD JUST
GO DOWN THERE

AND TAKE WHAT YOU WANT?

IT'S SALVAGE. FIRST ONE
GETS TO HER, STRIPS HER.

WHY NOT ME?

STRIPPING THE DEAD.

HEY, I DIDN'T KILL 'EM.

LOOK, IT'S A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY.

THE ONLY CHANCE I GOT.

[ Jean-Pierre laughing ]

I HAVE IT.

Ortega:
JEAN-PIERRE.

MON DIEU.

IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
ONE MOMENT,

MADEMOISELLE,

I, UH, MUST ATTEND
TO SOMETHING.

MY GOD, I DON'T BELIEVE 
YOU'RE STANDING HERE.

HOW YOU DO THIS?

I GOT A JOB
FOR YOU.

YEAH, I HAVE
THE CHARTER.

I GOT A BETTER ONE.

THAT DRISCOLL GIRL,
COQUINA,

WAS INVOLVED IN A ROBBERY
LAST NIGHT. PIRATE CAYE.

SOME DIVING STUFF IS MISSING,
AND NOW SO IS SHE.

YOU KNOW WHO SHE'S BEEN
HANGING AROUND WITH?

ARNO, YEAH.

STINKING TUB OF HIS
PROBABLY SANK.

FIND HIM.
NOBODY CUTS ORTEGA

AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.

THERE'S BIG MONEY
ON HIS HEAD.

HOW BIG?

WHATEVER THAT LADY PAYS,
I'LL DOUBLE IT. GET GOING.

MADEMOISELLE,
EVIDENTLY

THERE IS A CONDITION
IN THE HARBOR.

[ gasping ]

[ gasping ]

[ coughing ]

[ coughing ]

THEY'LL BE 
COMING SOON,

AND THE HELL OF IT IS,

I CAN'T GET IN,
AND I CAN'T GET AWAY.

[ coughing ]

GIVE IT UP, JEAN-PIERRE.

THERE ARE 300 OF THESE
STUPID ISLANDS.

THEN WE'LL DO 300, HMM?

TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOU
REALLY UP TO?

MY OLD MAN CAME TO AMERICA.

HE WORKED HARD
AND SAVED HIS MONEY.

PUT ME THROUGH COLLEGE.

I EVEN GOT ENOUGH EDUCATION 
TO MAKE ME STUPID.

[ laughs ]
SEE, I CONVINCED MY FATHER

TO INVEST EVERYTHING
HE HAD IN STOCKS,

THEN THE MARKET CRASHED.

HE LOST IT ALL.

HE HANGED HIMSELF
IN THE BASEMENT

OF THE HOUSE
HE NO LONGER OWNED.

MY MOTHER DIED 
SOON AFTER.

AFTER ALL THAT,
I JUST TOOK OFF.

TOOK THE FIRST PLANE
GOING ANYWHERE.

THE ONLY THING 
I BROUGHT WITH ME...

HIS WATCH.

IT'S FUNNY. I DROVE
AN AMBULANCE IN THE WAR,

SAVED PEOPLE'S LIVES
EVERY DAY.

I COULDN'T SAVE 
MY OWN FAMILY.

THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH A WORLD

THAT COULD
DO THAT TO A MAN.

THEN WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

WELL, MAYBE I'VE OVERCOME
EVERYTHING EXCEPT TEMPTATION.

YOU CAN HOOK A MARLIN

OR HOOK A FEW DIAMONDS
AND EMERALDS.

IT'S ALL FAIR GAME.

LET'S GO, ARNO.

LET'S JUST REPORT THIS
AND LEAVE IT ALONE.

IT'S NOT RIGHT.

LISTEN, I HAD
NOTHING TO DO

WITH THE DEATH
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

NOW SOMEONE'S
GONNA COME ALONG

AND STRIP
WHAT'S ON HER.

AND THAT SOMEONE'S
GONNA BE ME... US.

US?

US.

JANINE...

COME...

QUICKLY, MY SWEET.

THIS IS HIS BOAT, 
THECACA?

LOOKS LIKE IT.
SO WHAT?

SO, WE PAY HIM A VISIT.

FOR THE RANSOM MONEY?

NO, MY SWEET.
SOMETHING MUCH MORE.

Janine:
EVEN IF HE'S FOUND IT,

DO YOU REALLY THINK

ARNO'S GOING 
TO LET YOU IN ON IT?

Jean-Pierre:
WHY NOT?

YOU KNOW ME.

OH, YES, 
I KNOW YOU...

AND I KNOW ARNO.

SO...

SO.

[ laughs ]

AH!

HERE.

UNH!

[ coughs ]

[ Arno coughs ]

I'M GLAD I FIND YOU.

YEAH? YOU LOOKING
FOR THE REWARD?

A REWARD?

YOU KILL A GUY AND RUN,
THERE'S A REWARD.

AH!

[ anchor splashes ]

Jean-Pierre:
I DON'T COME
FOR THIS REWARD.

I SEE THERE WAS 
A BIGGER PRIZE.

I THINK MAYBE YOU FOUND
SOMETHING HERE. HAVE YOU?

LIKE WHAT?

I DON'T KNOW.

WHAT MAKES
YOUR NOSE BLEED?

THIS? HA...

I GOT CAUGHT WITH
THE BUTT OF MY ROD.

AH. WELL, WHATEVER
IT IS, ARNO,

SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YOU DON'T DO ALONE.

DO WHAT ALONE, J-P?
I THINK THE SUN'S GOT TO YOU.

YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT
THE RADIO SAYS,

I THINK WE COULD
BOTH HAVE PLENTY.

WHY-- WHY BE GREEDY?

WELL, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL.
SHOVE OFF.

I CAME TO BE ALONE
WITH MY GIRL.

LET ME TELL YOU 
WHY YOU NEED ME

FOR A PARTNER,
OKAY?

NUMBER ONE, THERE IS
A BIG SEARCH HERE NOW,

AS YOU MUST KNOW.

THERE ARE BOATS.
THERE ARE PLANES.

SO YOU HAVE NO TIME.

NUMBER TWO,
THEY LOOK FOR YOU.

HOW COULD YOU SHOW
YOUR FACE?

ORTEGA WAS BURIED TODAY
IN HIS GRAVE, HUH?

A BIG, SAD FUNERAL, 
MY FRIEND.

COME, COME, COME,
YOU NEED EQUIPMENT

TO GET DOWN THERE
TO GET WHAT'S THERE,

I HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED.

ARNO, THIS IS THE DEAL.
YOU TELL ME WHERE HERE,

I SHOW YOU HOW.
WE SPLIT 50-50, HUH?

ANOTHER THING,
DEAL OR NO DEAL,

WHEREVER YOUR BOAT GOES,
MINE GOES.

ARNO...

I THINK THERE WOULD BE
TWO RICH MEN HERE

INSTEAD OF ONE, HUH? 
D'ACCORD.

YOU GOT A DIVE SUIT?

IN THE FORWARD HOLD,
OF COURSE.

JANINE...

HOW ABOUT A COMPRESSOR? 
MINE KICKED THE BUCKET.

YOU KNOW, YOU FORGET
I AM HIRED FOR SALVAGE.

HOW IS THIS?

THIS IS COQUINA.

A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

I REMEMBER HER.

SHE WAS NOT
SO GROWN-UP.

OR SO BEAUTIFUL.

SO, COME CLEAN,
ARNO, WHERE IS IT?

DEAD CENTER.

SHE MUST HAVE GOT CAUGHT 
IN THE EYE OF THE STORM.

HUNG HERSELF UP
ON THE REEF THERE.

LET'S GO
TO WORK, HUH?

I BUSTED MY EARDRUM
DIVING,

OR I WOULD BE DOWN THERE
WITH YOU.

SURE YOU WOULD.

[ gasps ]

Arno:
ALMOST LOST AN ARM
FOR THIS.

[ Coquina gasps ]
MY GOD.

Janine:
LOOK AT THIS.

[ airplane approaches ]

Jean-Pierre:
SEARCH PLANES, HUH?

THEY GET CLOSER.

THEY LOOK FOR YOU.

EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOUR BOAT.

COME.

Jean-Pierre:
YOU KNOW,

I THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE SOME INSURANCE

AGAINST UNEXPECTED
DEPARTURES.

I TOOK THIS OFF
YOUR ENGINE.

FINE BY ME.

I TOOK THIS OFF YOURS.

[ laughs ]
TOUCHE.

Jean-Pierre:
OKAY, LET'S TAKE
THIS NECKLACE, THEN,

FOR THESE TWO BRACELETS
AND THESE TWO RINGS.

Arno:
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

WHY?

WILL YOU TAKE
WHAT YOU GIVE?

NO, I JUST HAVE A USE
FOR THIS NECKLACE.

WHAT? TO WEAR WITH
YOUR EVENING GOWNS?

[ both laugh ]

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 
HERE...

I THROW IN
TWO MORE RINGS.

COME ON,
I'VE BEEN COUNTING.

THERE ARE MORE DIAMONDS
IN ONE STRAND OF THAT NECKLACE

THAN IN ALL THE OTHER
STUFF COMBINED.

NO, NO. THE QUALITY
OF THE DIAMONDS

IN THESE RINGS
IS GREATER, HUH?

MY GOD, LOOK AT THEM.

LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL
THAT IS.

THEN YOU TAKE 'EM.

THAT'S NOT THE IDEA.
I DESERVE THE CHOICE.

I HAVE TO RUN THE RISK
OF FENCING THOSE, HUH?

YOU CAN'T EVEN 
BE SEEN.

I FOUND THE WRECK.

I DEFINITELY WANT
THE NECKLACE.

SO DO I.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE DO HERE

TO DECIDE THINGS?

IF YOU CHOOSE THE SHELL
WITH THE KERNEL...

THE NECKLACE IS YOURS.

TRY IT.

OKAY, DO IT ONCE AGAIN,
PLEASE. LET'S SEE THIS.

NOT THAT ONE!

EH, DAMN IT.

YOUR TURN.

THIS IS CRAP.

TAKE THAT.

Coquina:
I HAVE A LITTLE
PRESENT FOR YOU.

WHAT?

WHAT? YOU MEAN ALL
THREE SHELLS WERE EMPTY?

IT'S A TRICK
WE LEARNED AS CHILDREN.

YOU KNOW,
IT OCCURRED TO ME...

WHAT?

THE MORE I BRING UP,
THE LESS I'M NEEDED.

WHAT A THING TO SAY.

OH, NO,
THINK ABOUT IT.

WHAT'S TO STOP
JEAN-PIERRE

FROM TAKING OFF...

OR CALLING
THE SERGEANT MAJOR

OR CUTTING OFF
MY AIR SUPPLY, EVEN?

ARNO--

WELL, IT'S TRUE.

I NEED YOU.

YOU DO?

YES, I DO...

SO, YOU'LL BE SAFE.

Arno:
I'M GONNA TRY
TO GET INSIDE THE WRECK,

IF THAT RESIDENT SHARK 
WILL LET ME.

Coquina:
ARNO, WE HAVE ENOUGH.

THE RISK IS TOO GREAT.

I'LL BE OKAY.

WE WANT ALL THE JEWELRY,
DON'T WE?

LET'S PAY ATTENTION
TO THESE AIR LINES,

TO THESE ROPES.

GOT TO BE ABLE
TO PULL YOU FREE, HMM?

BE CAREFUL.

MERDE.

ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE HEADED THIS WAY.

LET'S PULL HIM UP NOW.

HELP ME.

BUT THE ROPE.

GO INSIDE. NOW.
NOW.

PLEASE GO.

PLEASE GO INSIDE.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

JUST LET THEM PASS.

Coquina:
HIS AIR!

[ labored breathing ]

[ plane passes overhead ]

THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

NOT YET.

[ labored breathing ]

[ plane passes ]

UNH!

[ Jean-Pierre laughs ]

[ panting ]

AHH.

WHAT?!

YOU SAVED MY LIFE AGAIN,
LADY PIRATE.

YOU'RE MAKING ME
BREAK MY RULE.

WHAT RULE?

NOT WANT ANYTHING.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

TO LEAVE HERE...

WITH YOU.

THEN LET'S LEAVE.

WHAT, NOW?

IT'S GETTING DANGEROUS.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN

HOW JEAN-PIERRE WAS
LOOKING AT YOU TODAY.

HE MIGHT TURN YOU IN
FOR THE PRICE ON YOUR HEAD.

LISTEN, YOU LET ME WORRY
ABOUT JEAN-PIERRE.

I'M SCARED TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, ARNO.

YOU SAY YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WORLDLY THINGS,

BUT YOU'RE RISKING
YOUR LIFE FOR JEWELS.

WELL, IT'S
WITH THOSE JEWELS

THAT I HOPE TO GIVE
YOU A BETTER LIFE.

BUT HOW MUCH DO WE NEED?

WE COULD START OUR LIFE NOW
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.

COULDN'T WE?

LET'S LEAVE WHILE WE CAN,
BEFORE THERE'S TROUBLE.

PLEASE.

OH...

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

TO SETTLE A MURDER RAP.

[ blues music ]

I WANT TO MAKE BAIL.

DO YOU?

ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
THAT MIGHT BE?

WELL, I KNOW THAT KILLING
IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE.

WAY BEYOND YOU.

THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

OF COURSE, WE WILL HAVE
TO REDUCE THE OFFENSE.

CHINO, MERIMAC!
COME HERE.

SHUT THE DOOR.
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

NOW, YOU BOTH SAW THE FIGHT
BETWEEN ARNO AND ORTEGA,

AND YOU BOTH DO
SOLEMNLY SWEAR

THAT YOU SAW ORTEGA
COME AT ARNO WITH AN AX,

AND ARNO WOUNDED HIM
IN SELF-DEFENSE, YES?

YES. 
YES, SIR.

GOOD LADS.
THAT'S FOR YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, SIR. 
YES, SIR.

AND THAT'S THAT.

WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

YOU SAID, "WOUNDED."

YES, IN THE SHOULDER,
A FLESH WOUND.

YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

I'D HAVE THOUGHT

JEAN-PIERRE
WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

FUTURE BAIL.

GET ME ORTEGA.

Arno:
THAT FROG BASTARD,
JEAN-PIERRE.

HE KNEW ABOUT ORTEGA.

THOSE JEWELS YOU GAVE
THE SERGEANT MAJOR,

THEY WEREN'T
PART OF THE SPLIT

WITH JEAN-PIERRE,
WERE THEY?

THEY WERE
PART OF THE SPLIT

WHILE I WAS
UNDER WATER.

I RISKED MY LIFE SO THAT
HE COULD STEAL THE LOOT

AND COME ON BACK HERE
TO BIMINI.

HE KNEW THAT
AS LONG AS I THOUGHT

I WAS A MURDERER,
I WOULD STAY AWAY.

WELL, I'M GONNA
GIVE HIM A TASTE

OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

ARE YOU WITH ME?

YOU DON'T TRUST
ANYBODY.

YOU KNOW MY MOTTO?

"YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS
IN YOUR POCKETS,

YOUR FLANKS COVERED,

AND YOU DON'T SLEEP
IN STRANGE BEDS."

SO, YOU COMIN'?

WHERE?

TO GET YOUR THINGS.

AND GRANDMA DRISCOLL'S
LAUDANUM.

ORTEGA, A LITTLE BEE HAS
JUST BUZZED THROUGH HERE.

I THINK IT'S TIME
TO LOOK FOR THE HIVE.

I SHOULD THINK YOU'LL FIND
JEAN-PIERRE IN THE HONEY.

[ plane flies overhead ]

TIME TO CLOSE
IT DOWN, HUH?

YEAH.

WELL,
WE WORK AT NIGHT.

SO THERE ARE NO PLANES,
HUH?

THEN I CAN PACK UP,
ESCAPE THE MURDER RAP.

WHY NOT?
TAKE YOUR SHARE,
MY FRIEND.

WHY WOULD I DO THAT, J-P?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

ORTEGA'S A WALKING CORPSE,
ISN'T HE?

WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT?

YOU AND YOUR DIRTY FRIENDS.
HE'S ALIVE...

AND YOU KNEW.

WHERE YOU HEAR THIS?

RIGHT FROM
THE SERGEANT MAJOR'S MOUTH.

YOU WENT 
TO THE POLICE?

LAST NIGHT,
ON YOUR SKIFF.

YOU ARE A FOOL.

YOU ARE TOTALLY CRAZY.

DON'T YOU SEE 
THEY FOLLOW YOU NOW?

SO WHAT IF THEY DO?

BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WHERE WE ARE!

ORTEGA, EVERYONE!
JESUS CHRIST.

I'M A DEAD MAN HERE.

NOW YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS,
YOU FILTHY LIAR.

WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

I CALLED YOU
A FILTHY LIAR.

LIAR?!

[ grunts ]

HELP!

HELP!

MY EAR!
[ coughs ]

MY EAR!

WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.

GOD DAMN IT!
MY EAR!

ARNO, LISTEN TO ME.
THERE IS GOLD.

WHAT?

IN THE SAFE
ABOARD THIS BOAT...

THERE IS GOLD.

ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR DIRTY SECRETS.

[ coughing ]

JUST TRUST ME.

PLEASE.

OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH, ARNO.

HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

Jean-Pierre:
SO, HOW MUCH
IS ARNO GIVING YOU?

GIVING ME?

WHAT SHARE
OF THE SPLIT?

I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE TOGETHER.

YOU'RE TOGETHER?

YOU COULD WIND UP
WITH NOTHING.

Jean-Pierre:
WHERE DOES HE HIDE
HIS STUFF, DO YOU KNOW?

Coquina:
NO.

YOU DON'T KNOW?

I THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD FIND OUT.

Jean-Pierre:
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

YOU FIND OUT, I'LL SPLIT IT 
WITH YOU, HALF AND HALF.

I MEAN,
WHAT THE HELL?

AT LEAST THIS WAY
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET.

BUT PLEASE, MY DARLING,
FOR YOUR SAKE, HUH?

FIND OUT.

Coquina:
I TRUST ARNO.

Jean-Pierre:
WELL, THERE MAY BE
COMPLICATIONS

FOR YOU ABOUT ARNO 
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

LIKE WHAT?

LIKE MAYBE HE TAKES UP
AGAIN WITH MY WIFE.

YOU GET NOTHING...

AND I MEAN JUST THAT.

NOTHING.

[ breathing hard ]

Jean-Pierre:
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IF THIS COMPRESSOR

WERE TO CONK OUT,

ARNO WOULD NEVER
COME UP.

HIS SHARE WOULD BE
ALL OURS, NO?

[ laughs ]

ALL OURS.

[ compressor sputters out ]

NO. NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

NO, NO, NO!
DON'T TOUCH--

IT'S AN OLD COMPRESSOR.
YOU'LL BREAK IT.

[ muffled grunts ]

Jean-Pierre:
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

HE DID SOMETHING.

I DID NOTHING.

GET IT STARTED, JEAN-PIERRE.
NONE OF YOUR DIRTY TRICKS.

[ gasping ]

Coquina:
ARNO WILL DIE!

WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?!

NOTHING! 
RIEN, JE TE DIS!

[ speaking French ]

HE'S ON THE ROPE!

[ labored breathing ]

LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S DROWNING.

HELP ME.

FASTER.

PULL ME UP!

[ grunts ]

Arno:
I'M LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE.

YOU LOSE THE SUIT,
THE HELMET.

WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?!

WE CAN FIX IT.

IN A MONTH,
YOU FIX THIS!

NO USE CRYIN' ABOUT IT.
WE GOTTA BLOW THE SAFE.

NOW YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO DO IT WITH?

HOW CAN WE DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT THE SUIT?

WITHOUT THE HELMET?

"DO WE HAVE ANYTHING"?!

WELL, I GUESS
IT'S UP TO ME.

HMM.

Janine, whispering:
ARNO...?

ARNO.

HE'S OUT OF CONTROL,

BUT WE CAN BEAT HIM.

WE CAN DO IT.
TOGETHER.

DON'T WORRY.
I'M A STEP AHEAD OF HIM.

OH, DON'T BE SO SURE.

I'M SURE.

[ boat motor ]

SO WHAT'S HIS NAME?

ORTHWELL.

DO YOU TRUST HIM?

HELL OF A LOT MORE
THAN I TRUST YOU.

YOU NEVER SAW SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

WELL, VOILA!

THE WOMEN WHO COME HERE
NEVER LOOK LIKE THIS.

THEY ONLY DRESS THIS WAY
IN CIVILIZED PLACES

LIKE PARIS, NEW YORK,

LONDON.

YOU WANT TO TRY ONE?

HEY.

HELLO, ARNO.

GOT SOMEBODY
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

OH, YEAH?

HE'S OKAY.

HEH.

JEAN-PIERRE,
ORTHWELL.

ALL RIGHT.

BROUGHT YOU A BOX

OF YOUR FAVORITE
BABY CORONAS, MINUS ONE.

HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

THANKS.

MY TOBACCO SUPPLY
AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.

DO YOU LIKE ARNO?

OF COURSE.

A LOT?

OF COURSE.

WE NEED SOME
UNDERWATER BANG,

HEAVY ENOUGH
TO BLOW STEEL.

YOU REMEMBER
HOW TO USE THIS STUFF?

YEAH,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

OKAY. I'VE GOT IT,
BUT IT'LL COST.

J-P HERE IS LOADED.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT, J-P?

START COUNTIN'.

IT'S NOT FOR ME, 
YOU UNDERSTAND.

IT'S FOR
THE ORGANIZATION.

HEH.

THIS IS FABULOUS
ON YOU.

BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN COLD.

OH, NO.

FOR COLD, A WOMAN
COULD WEAR A BLANKET.

THIS KIND OF FUR
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COLD.

IT HAS TO DO
WITH PERFUME...

AND SILK AND JEWELS.

THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

I DIDN'T THINK
JEAN-PIERRE WAS SO GENEROUS.

JEAN-PIERRE?
HUMPH.

THAT NICKEL-SQUEEZER?

NO. THESE ARE FROM
MY FIRST HUSBAND...

A JERK,

BUT A SPENDER.

IT'S ALL I CAN DO

TO KEEP JEAN-PIERRE'S
HANDS OFF

WHAT MONEY I HAVE.

WELL...

I'LL TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET.

10 MINUTES AFTER
WE SPLIT THIS STUFF,

I SPLIT FROM 
JEAN-PIERRE,

AND YOU GO
WITH ARNO?

YES.

WELL, 
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU...

BUT GET YOUR SHARE.

TAKE IT FROM ME.

DON'T TRUST 
ANYTHING

YOU CAN'T PUT 
ON YOUR BACK

OR AROUND 
YOUR NECK.

BECAUSE, MY DEAR,

YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS
BE SO YOUNG...

OR SO BEAUTIFUL.

WHAT ABOUT DIVING GEAR?
WE LOST OURS.

YOU MEAN, HARD HAT
AND ALL THAT?

NOTHING.

BUT I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT
WE USED TO USE FOR SPONGING.

YOU FIT THE AIR LINES
IN HERE.

AND AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
THE AIR COMING IN,

THAT'LL KEEP
THE WATER OUT.

SO THIS IS A BREATHING
STATION, HMM?

SO TO SPEAK.

WELL?

[ plane engine ]

Arno:
HOW MANY?

ONE WORKING NORTH,

ONE OVER THERE.

ANY BOATS?

YEAH, THERE IS ONE
OVER THERE TO THE EAST.

Jean-Pierre:
I WOULD SAY TONIGHT

IS OUR LAST CHANCE 
AT THE GOLD, HUH?

WE'D BETTER LAY LOW TODAY,
GET OUR REST.

D'ACCORD.

Arno:
HERE, TRY THIS.

MORE SUGAR.

ARNO...

MMM?

ARE YOU AND JANINE IN LOVE?

WHAT?

JEAN-PIERRE SAYS
YOU'LL RUN AWAY WITH HER.

WELL, A MAN WILL SAY
ANYTHING FOR GOLD,

ESPECIALLY A FRENCHMAN.

HE WANTS ME TO JOIN HIM
AND STEAL YOUR JEWELS.

REALLY?

GOOD IDEA.
YOU DO THAT.

LET'S TURN THE TABLES
ON HIM.

FIND OUT WHERE 
HE KEEPS HIS STASH.

WE'LL STEAL HISSTUFF.

YOU GO AHEAD AND PLAY
JEAN-PIERRE'S GAME.

THIS IS GETTING
VERY COMPLICATED.

THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

I GO WITH ARNO.

WHAT?

WELL, IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN...

WITH ANYTHING.

YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THAT?

YES!

I CAN HELP 
STEADY THE DRUM.

IT'S BIG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

Jean-Pierre:
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD
IDEA.

SHE CAN MAKE SURE

YOU DON'T HIDE ANY
FOR YOURSELF, HUH?

COQUINA CAN
STAY ON BOARD,

AND KEEP AN EYE ON YOU
AND THE COMPRESSOR.

THAT IS, OF COURSE,

UNLESS YOU WANT
TO COME DOWN

AND KEEP AN EYE
ON ME YOURSELF.

WERE IT NOT
FOR MY EAR, I WOULD.

LISTEN, WE CAN MAKE
A KILLING, YOU AND I.

I KNOW WHERE HE'S
HIDDEN HIS STASH.

WHY DON'T WE SPLIT,
TONIGHT?

JUST THE TWO OF US.

WHERE DOES HE HIDE IT?

I COME WITH
THE STASH, ARNO.

ALL RIGHT.

MEET ME ON THE BEACH
AT MIDNIGHT.

YOU BRING HIS LOOT,
I'LL BRING MINE. OKAY?

AND WE LEAVE?
JUST THE TWO OF US?

YEAH.

Jean-Pierre:
SO, COQUINA...

WHY DON'T WE
TAKE CARE OF US?

WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

IT'S NOT THERE.

WHAT?!

THE SHARK.
IT MUST HAVE ESCAPED.

HERE. TAKE THIS.

DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONE.

[ laughs ]

OH!

IT'S ALL SET.

OKAY.

HEH.

YOU WANT TO DO
THE HONORS?

ALL RIGHT.

[ muffled explosion ]

OH!

BULL'S-EYE!

[ laughs ]

TAKE THAT.

OKAY.

Jean-Pierre:
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

THE HELL WITH IT.

[ clicks off compressor ]

LET'S LEAVE IT DOWN THERE.

HUH? OH, GOD.

WE COME BACK, HUH? 
YOU AND I...

SOME OTHER TIME.

[ compressor starts ]

UHH... UH...

WHO ARE YOU WITH?
YOU WITH HIM?

OR ARE YOU WITH ME?

I DON'T KNOW.

OH!

WHAT'S WRONG?

IT'S NOT OPEN.

WE'VE ONLY GOT
ONE CHARGE LEFT.

IF THIS DOESN'T
BLOW IT,

THEN IT'S
BYE-BYE, GOLD.

OH!

UH!

Jean-Pierre:
LOOK, I BRING
THEM UP.

ON THE BEACH AT MIDNIGHT,
WE MEET, HUH?

YOU BRING 
ARNO'S STASH.

IF YOU BRING YOURS.

I'LL GO SEE
WHAT'S WRONG.

ALL RIGHT.

[ thump ]
AAH!

OHH!

ARNO--!

AAH!

[ screaming ]

AAH!

SHARK!

WHERE IS JANINE?

NO, ARNO, NO!

NO!

ARNO!

ARNO!

OH, MY GOD!

JANINE!
JANINE!

Coquina:
I DON'T SEE HER.

JANINE!

Coquina:
OH, GOD!

Arno:
JANINE!

Coquina:
NO!

All:
JANINE!

SHE COULD HAVE BEEN
A MILLIONAIRE.

AND YOU MAKE HER GO DOWN
IN A STUPID DRUM.

YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO LET HER GO.

WHAT?

YOU HEARD HER.

YOU TRIED TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF US.

LET'S GO.

COQUINA...

YOU COMIN'?

I DON'T KNOW.

WHAT?

YOU AND JANINE.

WHAT ABOUT ME AND JANINE?

I RISKED MY LIFE 
FOR ALL OF US!

AND THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SHOW FOR IT?

PART OF THIS IS YOURS.

I ONLY WANT
THE NECKLACE...

AS A MEMENTO.

I'LL GET IT.

[ sighs ]

WE TAKE HIM
FOR EVERYTHING.

JEWELS.

COURTESY OF GRANDMA,

HE'LL HAVE
A NICE, LONG SLEEP.

AND WE'LL HAVE
THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

YOU REALLY HAD ME
GOIN' THERE, LADY PIRATE.

Jean-Pierre:
COQUINA!

YES! HE THINKS
I'M LEAVING WITH HIM.

SALUD.

TO JANINE.

TO JANINE.

TO JANINE.

I LEARNED FROM HER.

[ thump ]

HO HO HO, LOOK.

WHAT ARE WE HAVING,
A LITTLE CELEBRACION?

[ laughs ]

OH, LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT'S THIS, HUH?

THIS LOOKS LIKE GOLD.

DOESN'T THAT LOOK LIKE 
GOLD TO YOU, JUANITO?

AHH...
FRISK THEM.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
COME ON, YOU.

I THOUGHT 
WE WERE FRIENDS.

YEAH, THAT WAS
BEFORE YOU TRIED

TO DOUBLE-CROSS ME.

YOU'LL BE GETTING
YOUR SHARE, HMM?

Arno:
NOT MY SHARE.

ARNO, I THOUGHT
WE WERE PALS, HUH?

SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE.

YOU CUT ME...

I CUT YOU!

ORTEGA, HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

JUST TAKE IT!

PLEASE, JUST TAKE 
THE DAMN GOLD!

I SAID, HIS SHARE,
NOT MY SHARE!

SHUT UP!

YOU HEAR THAT, JUANITO?

DON'T TAKE ANY GOLD

THAT HAS ARNO'S NAME 
ON IT.

WHERE'S THE REST?

WHERE IS WHAT?

THE JEWELRY.

I HAVE IT. HERE.

TAKE IT. HERE.

HERE. TAKE IT!

Ortega:
AND THE REST?

[ laughs ]

YOU WANT IT?

GO AHEAD,
TAKE ALL OF IT.

TAKE ALL OF IT.
ALL RIGHT?

TAKE IT!

TAKE IT.

[ gunshots ]

[ Coquina whimpering ]

THANKS, ARNO.

JANINE.

I WOULD HAVE SPLIT
EVERYTHING WITH YOU.

HONESTLY, I WOULD.

HONESTLY.

TO US.

ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO ME.

I'M GONNA DROP YOU OFF
AT PIRATE CAYE.

IF ANYBODY ASKS,

I TOOK OFF ON MY OWN.

I'M GONNA HIDE OUT
AT ORTHWELL'S

FOR A FEW DAYS.
THEN I'M GONNA COME BY

TO PICK YOU UP LATER,
ALL RIGHT?

THERE'S AN OLD RUIN
OF A CHAPEL BEHIND
OUR HOUSE.

I CAN HIDE
THE JEWELS THERE.

NO, NO, I THINK IT'S
BETTER AT ORTHWELL'S.

TRUST ME.

ALL RIGHT.

IT'S ALL OURS.
IMAGINE THAT?

ALL OF IT.

HA, AND I AM ALL YOURS.

WE CAN GO
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

TELL ME AGAIN
ABOUT PARIS.

HUH. HEH HEH.

WELL, WE'RE RIDING
ON A CARRIAGE...

BOIS DE BOULOGNE,

CHESTNUT TREES
ARE IN BLOSSOM.

MMM...

[ seagull calling ]

ALL RIGHT!

WHERE IS IT?

WHERE'S WHAT?

YOU KNOW DAMN WELL!

KNOW WHAT?

GET UP!

UNH!

MY TAKE!
COUGH IT UP!

COQUINA.

WHAT?!

WHERE DID SHE GO?!

EAST... WEST...

TAKE YOUR PICK.

GOD DAMN IT.

WELL, LET'S
FIND HER, ARNO!

OKAY, JEAN-PIERRE,
YOU WANT TO FIND HER?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

LOADED WITH 
DIAMONDS AND GOLD,

WHERE SHOULD 
WE START, HUH?

JEAN-PIERRE! 
ARNO!

YOU'RE BOTH
UNDER ARREST!

PRAY TELL, SERGEANT MAJOR,
WHATEVER FOR?

POSSESSION
OF STOLEN PROPERTY!

HEH.

Sergeant Major:
$1 MILLION IN GOLD!

[ laughs ]

ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?

NO, SERGEANT MAJOR, NO.

THE JOKE IS ON US.

[ laughing ]

MERDE.

GOD DAMN IT.

[ torch song plays ]

HEY, ARNO.

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR A LONG TIME, MAN.

I GOT A PACKAGE 
FOR YOU.

OH, YEAH?

WHAT TIME
YOU GOT, MAMA?

3:45.

[ ticking ]

SHE FIXED IT.

AND YOU BE MOANING
TO MAMA AGAIN?

YOU'LL BE LISTENIN'?

SQUEEZE THE LIMES,
HONEY.
