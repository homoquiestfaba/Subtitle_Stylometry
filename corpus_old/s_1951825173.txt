Bon soir, s'il vous plait, je voudrais
un verre de lait au chocolat

et soupe d'oignons
et sandwich avec...

How do you say 'grilled cheese'?

<i>Un toast au fromage.</i>

Merci, exactement.

Merci beaucoup.

Hallo.

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>I'm on my way from the airport and the front
desk won't get me your room number.</i>

<i>What's your room number?</i>

403.

<i>See you in half an hour.</i>

Wait a second.
<i>- What?</i>

Where are you?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

I didn't say you could come here.

<i>Can I come there?</i>

OK.

<i>I'll see you in half an hour.</i>

What's this music?

How did you find me?

It wasn't actually that hard.

Are you going to take a bath?

It's for you.

What got you here?

Bar in the lobby.

What the fuck is going on?

How long have you had
this hotel room?

I don't know.

More than a week?

More than a week.

More than a month?

More than a month.

How much does it cost?

I think around 750 million euros
or something.

How long are you gonna stay?

How long do you wanna stay?

I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

I think it's time for you to go home.

Probably.

Are you running away from me?

I thought I already did.

Would you get me
a bloody mary, please?

Two bloody maries, please.

Have you slept with anyone?

No. Have you?

No.

That was a long pause.

I guess it doesn't really matter.
No,it doesn't.

You got bruises on your body.

Whatever happens, man, I don't
wanna lose you as my friend.

I promise, I will never
be your friend.

No matter what... ever.

We fuck and I will
feel like shit tomorrow.

That's ok with me.

I love you.

I never hurt you on purpose.

I don't care.

Wanna see my view of Paris?

OK.
