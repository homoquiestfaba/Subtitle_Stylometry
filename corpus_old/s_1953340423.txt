The fight to control

illegal immigration isn't just

on our borders... Lawmakers in Arizona

passed a sweeping overhaul...

In a few months, president
Obama will push

legislation to legalize the

nation's 12 million illegal immigrants.

...I feel bad when the bus is leaving--

And I know that he's there.

<i>Illegal immigration...</i>

<i>America's 21st century dilemma.</i>

<i>It's estimated that more than</i>

<i>a million illegal immigrants</i>

<i>enter the U.S. every year.</i>

<i>They face countless dangers.</i>

<i>Some succumb to dehydration</i>

<i>and exposure.</i>

<i>Some fall victim to human</i>

<i>traffickers and warring</i>

<i>drug cartels.</i>

<i>And others...</i>

<i>Simply disappear.</i>

<i>Why do they risk their lives?</i>

<i>Because the American dream's</i>

<i>still so powerful.</i>

<i>Hey, Spielberg.</i>

<i>We get it. Come on, man.</i>

<i>Got a headache.</i>

<i>Dude, dude, guys, check out</i>

<i>the bullet holes in that sign.</i>

<i>I feel like a bear took a</i>

<i>shit in my head.</i>

<i>Hey, Brad, can you pull over,</i>

<i>brother?</i>

<i>Brad.</i>

<i>Brad.</i>

<i>Brad, pull... Brad.</i>

<i>Brad.</i>

<i>Brad.</i>

<i>Hey, we do need to shoot some</i>

<i>b-roll on that.</i>

<i>Pull the shit over, Bradley.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

<i>We're already late.</i>

<i>How do you be late?</i>

<i>We're in Mexico.</i>

<i>Jim.</i>

<i>What? I'm sor--, I had a big</i>

<i>night last night, O.K.?</i>

<i>I slept in.</i>

<i>Because... Sake bombs.</i>

Where were you, by the way?
Uh, you didn't invite me,

douchebag.

Right.

Next time.
Next time, definitely... maybe.

What's up, kid?

Guys... I think that
kid took my wallet.

What are you drinking there?

Electrolytes, bro.

You look like shit. Mmm.

I love being around creative people

like you guys; You're so, like,

in the moment.

So... Brad.

Where are you from again?

Uh, well, I was actually born in Dallas.

And, and, and how long did

you live in London?

I was in London for about a year.

A whole year?

Travis, don't you...
Have anything to do?

Keep yourself busy?

No, this is all I got to do

right now, actually.

It works out nice.

Babe, babe, I can handle

myself, all right?

Yeah, west Texas boys could be

quite rambunctious.

How do you say "suck my cock"

in an English accent?

Suck on my cock.

Suck on my cock.

Suck, suck on my cock.

Suck on my cock.

Cock, cock, cock... Suck on my cock.

I'm the queen of england.

I suck cock... With Brad.

You know what's really funny?

She actually hates London.

Didn't you say that?

You, you hated...? No, I
just hated London with you.

Ooh... get a little e.C.U.
On that one.

Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker.

No comment.

What's your response to the

allegations you ran a sweatshop

of illegal immigrants?

I run a family business.

A family business.

That's very noble of you, sir.

Does a family business threaten

and intimidate their employees?

Does it deny their workers

safety equipment?

Does it fire them when they're

injured on the job?

Whoops.

Get that camera out of my face!

Mr. Whitaker, what about

Miguel Gonzales, the man that

you crippled?

Was he family?

Would you apologize to him?

Car troubles?

I have a Mexican friend,
he can fix that.

He's a citizen though, is that

gonna be an issue?

Did you get that?

Tell me you got that.

...all right, let's get going.

Got everything.

O.K., I'll ping you.

All right.

That sound good?

Sorry.

Be safe.

See you back in Austin, babe.

Really?

Uh-huh.

Bye, babe.

Hey, later Brad.

Let's hang out.

Yeah? No.

<i>Si.</i>

<i>Guys, guys, this is my cousin</i>

<i>No, you told me 200</i>

<i>each-- that's one thousand</i>

<i>dollars, comprendo?</i>

<i>Would you tell him that?</i>

<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

<i>Would you stop filming,</i>

<i>I stopped.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Como esta...</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>You all set?</i>

<i>Behind me, two dozen men, women</i>

<i>and children have sacrificed</i>

<i>everything for this moment.</i>

<i>They're about to cross over 300
miles of treacherous terrain for</i>

<i>Miles of treacherous terrain for</i>

<i>the promise of a better life.</i>

<i>We're gonna join them.
How was that?</i>

<i>Patronizing.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Jim!</i>

<i>Let's go, man. What are you doing?</i>

<i>O.K., coming!</i>

<i>Sorry, bro.</i>

<i>Had to take care of some</i>

<i>business.</i>

<i>You're trying to get</i>

<i>some bud?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>I get nauseous on long</i>

<i>car rides.</i>

<i>When I found about out
what happened to Miguel, I cried.</i>

<i>...probably for the first time</i>

<i>since my daughter Claudia</i>

<i>was born.</i>

<i>Family is the most important</i>

<i>thing to me, supporting them and</i>

<i>when I found out, I had to do</i>

<i>something.</i>

<i>Boo!</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>I'm doing an interview, silly.</i>

<i>Good, O.K.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>I can't disclose our exact</i>

<i>The border fence is just past</i>

<i>United States. Got that shit? Good.</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, go, go!</i>

<i>Hey, dude, you O.K.?</i>

<i>Hey, what did we say?</i>

<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

<i>What? Are you kidding me? We're done.</i>

<i>We're done.</i>

<i>We did not sign up for this.</i>

<i>I know, this is a thousand
times better.</i>

<i>You think that was better?</i>

<i>How was that better, Travis?</i>

<i>Somebody died back there.</i>

<i>That is not better.</i>

<i>Put your phones--</i>

<i>Listen to me, O.K.?</i>

<i>This trip, this whole thing

<i>Thirsty, you want some water?</i>

<i>Everyone seems to be in good spirits.</i>

<i>If you look around, the tension</i>

<i>has died.</i>

<i>There's a stillness to the</i>

<i>Seems like it's gonna be a</i>

<i>pretty tight fit.</i>

<i>Shit, grab your shit.</i>

<i>Grab your shit, come on,</i>

<i>go, go, go.</i>

<i>Are you getting this, filming?</i>

<i>Wait-- no, no, no,</i>

<i>Fuck!</i>

<i>O. K., it's working.</i>

<i>Selina, selina, come here.</i>

<i>Wanna do shadow puppets? It

<i>That's a very good one.</i>

<i>It's very cramped in here.</i>

<i>We're about a hundred Miles away</i>

<i>The air is tense. Let's go
talk to some of our travelers.</i>

<i>Como? </i>

<i>Yes, officer?</i>

<i>Ah! Ow!</i>

<i>You feel that?</i>

<i>What do I have to do? What, what do I have

<i>Uh.
Hold on, just gimme a second.</i>

<i>My crew and I have been detained</i>

<i>by a group... Of patriots.</i>

<i>They promised, they said that</i>

<i>Is that good, is that it or no?</i>

<i>Is that O.K.?</i>

<i>Over here.</i>

<i>Come closer.</i>

<i>Illegal immigration is a plague</i>

<i>that threatens to overtake the</i>

<i>United States of America.</i>

<i>We are sick and tired of these</i>

<i>vermin pouring in over</i>

<i>our borders...</i>

<i>Crawling up on our shores...</i>

<i>Bleeding this country dry.</i>

<i>We are slowly losing our</i>

<i>country, but we are determined</i>

<i>to take it back.</i>

<i>Well, as you will see,</i>

<i>Is that clear?</i>

<i>Is that clear?</i>

<i>Good.</i>

<i>Let's roll. You there, not too close.
That's enough.</i>

<i>This charming fellow forces</i>

<i>women to cross our border</i>

<i>as drug mules.</i>

<i>They have to swallow condoms</i>

<i>filled with cocaine.</i>

<i>It's about</i>

<i>the only time you ever hear of</i>

<i>Mexicans using condoms. If they
refuse, a family member gets shot.</i>

<i>He said "fuck your mother." He
said "fuck my mother"? Youmother.</i>

I got this.

<i>Open up, come here, open up.</i>

<i>Open up! Open up!</i>

<i>She's sick.</i>

<i>I'm taking her to the infirmary.</i>

<i>You don't have</i>

<i>So, let's start over.</i>

<i>Get to know each other.</i>

<i>Jim.</i>

<i>I'm hungry.</i>

<i>Marta is a fantastic cook.</i>

<i>What about you?</i>

<i>Are you on a diet?</i>

<i>Here.</i>

<i>I don't want it.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Let's see.</i>

<i>These gates right here,</i>

<i>they're meant for,</i>

<i>originally for cattle.</i>

<i>But they work real good</i>

<i>on the Mexicans.</i>

<i>And it just keeps them</i>

<i>right in line.</i>

<i>And then if you look down,</i>

<i>there's, we painted this</i>

<i>orange line here because some</i>

<i>of them...</i>

<i>Some of them aren't,</i>

<i>aren't real smart.</i>

<i>So you paint the line and then</i>

<i>they just follow right along.</i>

<i>And it's like, it makes it</i>

<i>really, really easy.</i>

<i>Just on this side, that's where</i>

<i>the artist's room is.</i>

<i>He's got all kinds of stuff</i>

<i>in there.</i>

<i>And my room is just on</i>

<i>the other side.</i>

<i>And then a whole, this is all,</i>

<i>this is like right in the middle</i>

<i>of everything.</i>

<i>And that's the, um,</i>

<i>the infirmary is over here.</i>

<i>Where's that pregnant</i>

<i>girl that you guys were supposed</i>

<i>to bring here?</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>And then just supplies.</i>

<i>Lamb?</i>

<i>See?</i>

<i>Here, this is the women's room.</i>

<i>We keep all the women</i>

<i>Everybody say hi.</i>

<i>They're real shy.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Must be, must be that time</i>

<i>Hey, hey!</i>

I'm a God damn American citizen.</i>

<i>Get his wife.</i>

<i>You and your wife have</i>

<i>been granted a rare opportunity</i>

<i>to gain entry into the united</i>

<i>states of America.</i>

<i>This is the official</i>

<i>citizenship test.</i>

<i>Take it away, Remy.</i>

<i>O. K., I'ma give you</i>

<i>the rules now.</i>

<i>O. K., we're gonna ask</i>

<i>you some questions.</i>

<i>And for every one that you get</i>

<i>right, we're gonna undo one of</i>

<i>her wrists, so we're making it</i>

<i>real easy on you.</i>

<i>Question one. How many representatives
are there in congress?</i>

<i>How many representatives
are there in congress?</i>

<i>Oh yeah, no, it's not a</i>

<i>English question,</i>

<i>it's a math question.</i>

<i>You know math?</i>

<i>435, you're wrong.</i>

<i>O.K., question two. Who
wrote the star-spangled banner?</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Que?</i>

<i>Now that is very close.
Francis Scott key.</i>

<i>It's not que, it's key!</i>

Francis Scott key.

Stop, stop it!

Please!

Please stop.

When I applied for my

citizenship, I had to take this test.

And I was proud.

I studied very hard.

But you're defending a man who

entered a country he
doesn't even respect!

He doesn't understand
what you're saying.

When it comes to fucking food

stamps, these people understand

English perfectly well!

O.K., question three.

How many stripes are there in

the U.S. flag?

Hey, hey, hey! Cheating. No cheating.

Ten.

Eleven.

Twelve.

Twelve?

No, no, thirteen.

Thirteen.

Ah!

Thirteen, thirteen.

Correct.

Thirteen!

Undo! Undo her wrist.

Good job.

Keep up the good work.

Question number four.

O.K.

O.K. Hey, hey, no, you, no. No, no, no.

O.K.

Who said, "give me liberty or

give me death?"

Please.

<i>No.</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Thomas Jefferson.</i>

<i>Thomas Jefferson.</i>

<i>Thomas Jefferson.</i>

<i>What is that?</i>

<i>This is one of the most famous</i>

<i>quotes in American history.</i>

<i>And it defines the</i>

<i>American spirit.</i>

<i>Give me liberty or give me...</i>

<i>Oh my God!</i>

<i>I thought we had</i>

<i>an agreement... huh?</i>

<i>We talk, you film.</i>

<i>Pick up the camera.</i>

<i>Toma... Je-Jeff... Huh?</i>

<i>Je-Jeffrey...?</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>He's very close.</i>

<i>Now, the answer is</i>

<i>Patrick Henry... hmm.</i>

<i>Put him on the rack and bring</i>

<i>in another wetback.</i>

<i>Wait, wait.</i>

<i>No, no, stop, stop.</i>

<i>We need him.</i>

<i>We need another cameraman.</i>

<i>Davie can't do this shit</i>

<i>by himself.</i>

<i>Well, she seems to be</i>

<i>handling herself perfectly well.</i>

<i>She's a producer.</i>

<i>She doesn't know shit.</i>

<i>She's never held a camera in her</i>

<i>entire life, please.</i>

<i>Alberto told me</i>

<i>on the truck he knows how to use a camera.
We need him.</i>

<i>You're not gonna get
an illegal immigrant</i>

<i>when there are Americans
who can do the job.</i>

<i>You have marta.</i>

<i>- Hey, hey, hey.</i>- <i>O.K.</i>

<i>Let's continue filming.</i>

<i>Get him off the chair,
get her out of here.</i>

<i>Bien.</i>

<i>Bien.</i>

<i>They're leaving.</i>

<i>I couldn't see how many,</i>

<i>I don't know, three or four.</i>

<i>But they got in their truck</i>

<i>and they're leaving.</i>

<i>Are you sure?</i>

<i>No, I mean I'm not</i>

<i>"sure sure", but yeah, there's a</i>

<i>truck leaving.</i>

<i>Yeah, it's gone.</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Liz?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Trying to get out.</i>

<i>Liz.</i>

<i>Liz.</i>

<i>Don't break, don't break.</i>

<i>It's unbreakable.</i>

<i>We tried that last night.</i>

<i>Does anybody have a</i>

<i>screwdriver or something? To try and get
What the fuck?</i>

<i>Wait.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

<i>Let me see, let me see.</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

<i>You're smarter than this,</i>

<i>listen to me.</i>

<i>I'm not listening to you, I</i>

<i>listened to you... shh, shh!</i>

<i>...anymore with you!</i>

<i>I'm not gonna calm down!</i>

<i>Maria is dead.</i>

<i>- And William is dead!
Hey, hey.</i>

<i>- I am not gonna be the next one!
Sorry.</i>

Hey, hey.

Sorry.

You all right?

Why do you think they

left that door unlocked?

We are fucking mice.

It doesn't matter,

man, listen, the door's open,

they're gone.

We've gotta take a shot.

Sorry, listen.

I just need you to think
about this, O.K.?

There's a right way,
there's a wrong way.

We use precision.

We have some strategy, we have

our tapes, we have our points

of entry, exit.

We're not just gonna

go blindly into the dark.

Wait a minute.

Jesus.

He's right.

O.K., we think about it for a

second, O.K.?

Listen to me.

We can help them.

We can.

Please.

We can't stay here.

O.K.

O.K., good.

All right.

Give me a flashlight.

No, no, no flashlight.

O.K., be quiet.

O.K.

Why are you bringing the tapes?

It's for the police. Someone's
gotta shut these fuckers down.

Alberto.

O.K.
Here, here-- take, take this.

What if they see the lights?

They can't, it's night vision.

Travis, I can't see.

Just follow us.
We got night vision.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

They make them sleep like this.
Hey.

Shh!

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, where is it?

Oh, oh shit.

What is it?

Hold the fence.

Travis, what the fuck

are you doing? Get down!

Travis, what are you doing?

All right, this is taking too

long, we gotta go.

Take this. O.K., O.K.

Easy, easy.

Oh shit.

Fuck, fuck.

Can't see shit.

Fuck, where's Alberto? We gotta go!
Hey!

Shh.

Alberto.

Come on, Alberto, back up.
What's going on?

We gotta go, now.

O.K. Which way?
Which way?

I still can't
see, I can't see.

It's all barbed wire.

What is that?
Oh God.

Shh.

Oh shit, run, run!

Help me! Help me!

Ahh!

I'm coming back.

I'm coming back.

Liz!

[Shouts in pain,

Ah, get him off!

Get him off! Help!

Pancakes.

Thank you, marta.

Good bacon. No, not him.
He's not eating.

I'm not hungry.

I must say.

I'm a little bit disappointed in you.

You said you'd let the kids go.

And we did.

No, you didn't.

Because we saw his daughter

there and there were dogs and

razor wire and-- they were given clear

instructions, but his daughter

didn't listen.

She took off in another direction.

But there's a lesson to be learned here.

Don't fuck with me.

The only way you're going

home is to do exactly what I tell you.

There's a few more things I'd

like to get on camera.

And if you challenge me again,

I'm gonna fucking kill you.

Could you please pass me the syrup?

Thank you, Travis.

You'll have to excuse the mess.

Marta and the maids aren't

allowed in here, and...

I don't get too many visitors.

Sorry about that.

I've been wondering something.

When you came in through the

drug tunnel, what did you think

of my work?

I mean the, the, you know,

the body in the tunnel.

Did it frighten anyone away?

Yeah.

One, I think.

One.

That's, that's a problem.

You see, I'm not here to build

a better mousetrap.

I'm here to build a better scarecrow.

The hell does that mean?

I'm glad you asked that.

Think about that body you saw.

All these videos that you're

shooting right now, when we send

them to the Mexican media,

it'll put the stopper on.

It'll say, "stay where
the fuck you are."

The right image can make all

the difference in the world.

I mean, that's why you're here.

That's the point of this video.

And to do that, the message

needs to be stronger.

Jesus!

"Jesus."

Oh, that's interesting.

"Jesus."

You know when the guy comes to

school and he wants somebody

from the audience, it's just like that.

I just want you to come upstage.

It's hard because she's lying

flat and she's all stiff.

I, I need somebody upright.

Well, you're a botticelli now.

But if I let you rot in the sun

a few days, you'll be rubenesque.

I'm gonna take a bone saw to her

skull, right below the hairline.

Right here.

Skull cap comes off.

Remove her brain, her eyes,

all the soft tissues.

Then, I'm gonna run electrical

wiring through her sinus

cavities to a hundred-watt bulb

at the back of her brain pan.

It'll look like a glowing, white halo.

Like an angel.

Imagine.

Our sweet, innocent girl here,

naked at the end of a tunnel.

Cradling her baby like the

Paints
quite a picture, doesn't he?

What's the surprise?

Gonna lecture again while you

kill someone?

On the contrary.

El toro screens the blood of

everyone who comes here.

And if they're clean, we'll make

a donation on their behalf.

And this man has been matched...

For a kidney.

The equation is very

simple-- by saving an American

life, we will spare his.

Hey.

We're not doing it for the money.

We're doing it for our country.

Hey, Remy, want to play spic-tac-toe?

Can I go first?
You can be "x" s.

Help me or get out.

Is he really a surgeon?

'Course he's a surgeon.

Ugh.

Gallo, you're a bleeder.

You know, he's the first

one to graduate from high school

in his family.

And then he just kept going

right through med school.

And then in his third year of

residency, on his way back from

the hospital, a gang of illegal

immigrants approached him.

All right, let's

clamp off the blood vessels.

O.K., get the cooler, let's go.

He gave them everything

he had in his pockets.

No, no, that wasn't enough.

Shh, he's a real good doctor.

Know what they did?

They fucking cut his throat.

Gotta sew him up.

Doesn't make it right.

What was that?

It doesn't make it right.

Would you say the same thing?

Hey! Shut the fuck up.

Fuck you.

Just film this.

If someone came up to you

with a fucking box cutter and

just did this to you.

Hey, z.

I'd like to remove his corneas.

What do you think?

As long as he lives!

Take whatever fits in the cooler.

Jim-- shit!

Jim, Jim.

Hey, come back!

It's all right...
I got her.

You O.K.?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm fine, no, don't worry about it.

Worry about Jim.

Worry about Jim.

Worry about Jim.

Fuck, I don't know.

I don't know where he is.

I don't know.

They're playing with us.

They're never gonna let us go. Hey, don't.
They have no reason to.

We just need to find some leverage.

Somehow we just, we gotta find

something, there's gotta be...

All right, get up, come on. Bring the
cameras, let's go. Not until we see Jim.

I want you to record that

we're taking really good care of him.
Continue filming.

Hey.

Hey.

How you feeling?

Feel really good.

Yeah?

Good.

I want you to hang in there,

O.K., because we're gonna get

you home really soon.

Feel good.

Good, good.

Listen, man.

About last night, that was
just, I didn't, I was...

Don't worry about it, t.

All right.

Visitation's over!

Wait a minute.

Can we have five more minutes?

No.

Got a documentary to shoot.

Come on.

You know what?

All right, you want a documentary?

We'll have a documentary.

Over here.

Why are you doing this?

Why am I doing this?

Isn't that obvious by now?

Oh no I, I, I completely get it.

Illegal aliens cause crime.

They carry diseases.

So does everyone else.

This is all just racism posing

as patriotism.

I bet you rehearsed that all morning.

<i>You want to know what</i>

<i>I think?
I'm thinking you're targeting</i>

<i>Oh, she can think now!
People like him and the people</i>

I'm thinking you're targeting

people like him and the people

outside because they're

undocumented, and you get to do

your sick things on them and

think you can get away with it.

Your propaganda, your patriotic

front is bullshit.

You're not a patriot.

You're fucking insane.

Don't take it!

No, no.

You feel that?

Now that's what the brain of

an idiot feels like.

You want to be an idiot?

Leave her the fuck alone!

This is how it ends.

Continue filming.

It's not coming off.

Yeah, don't worry, it'll come off.

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, what's that?

Shh, shh, shh. Shit, is that a truck?
Oh, shit.

Where is it?

Hold it, hold it.

There it is.

There it is.

Oh, God, come on.

Come on, come on, come on.

Come on-- fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Shit.

Oh, oh, God, fuck.

Lizzie.

Lizzie, Liz, get up.

See? I told you, a truck.

Oh, my God.

Hey!

A truck, come on.

Liz, Liz, a truck.

Just please help us!

Please, call, call the police.

We've been kidnapped.

They're trying to kill us.

Be quiet, keep quiet.

Oh, shit, he's right behind you-- run!

Where the fuck have you been, man?

Had to change a tire.

Fuck.

Jesus. Fuck.

I thought I made myself

perfectly clear, huh?

No, no.

You chose not to listen.

Me and my men have shown you

a lot of hospitality.

And a lot of respect.

What do we get in return?

We're sorry.

Yes-- no!

It was, it wasn't like that.

We're sorry.

Huh?

Fucking respect.

Bring 'em in.

I have to say, your tapes

<i>were very informative.</i>

<i>Tia!</i>

<i>Oh, fuck, please, man.</i>

<i>Maybe from now on,</i>

<i>we'll have your attention.</i>

<i>Tia!</i>

<i>Tia! Tia!</i>

<i>Fucking shit! Hey, hey. You
fucking drop your knife.</i>

<i>You fucking drop your knife.</i>

<i>Drop that fucking knife.
Drop that fucker right now.</i>

<i>Don't do this.</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>

<i>Davie, you're making</i>

<i>a big mistake.</i>

<i>Give me the fucking keys now,</i>

<i>retard.</i>

<i>Give me your fucking keys.</i>

<i>Drop your gun.</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>

<i>You shut the fuck up!</i>

<i>Davie!</i>

<i>Davie!</i>

<i>Davie!</i>

<i>Fucking Christ!</i>

<i>No, davie! Please!</i>

<i>Are you happy now?</i>

<i>Fuck... Are you happy now?</i>

<i>Motherfucker.</i>

<i>Fuck you.</i>

<i>I'm gonna break your fucking</i>

<i>face off.</i>

<i>Mr. director, are you</i>

<i>happy now?</i>

<i>Please just... </i>

<i>Now, Travis, tell me.</i>

<i>Why did you make this</i>

<i>documentary?</i>

<i>Those people you killed.</i>

<i>They were davie's cousins.</i>

<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

<i>Davie was my best friend.</i>

<i>This was important to him.</i>

<i>We were trying to stop the</i>

<i>people that hurt his family.</i>

<i>I'm really glad</i>

<i>you told me that, Travis.</i>

<i>Really am.</i>

<i>Do you mind if we talk some economics?</i>

<i>Travis, I want you to meet...</i>

<i>Supply.</i>

<i>And demand.</i>

<i>Go ahead. Interview them.</i>

<i>English, please?</i>

<i>That is one of the biggest</i>

<i>suppliers of illegal immigrants.</i>

<i>What the fuck is the matter with you?
Have it your way.</i>

<i>My dear Travis, I hope</i>

<i>your second interview will be</i>

<i>a little more in-depth. Please,
guys, don't fucking kill me.</i>

<i>I know you.</i>

<i>I know you.</i>

<i>You're that fuck-- what the fuck</i>

<i>is this about, man?</i>

<i>Mr. Whitaker, what is your</i>

<i>response to the allegations that</i>

<i>you ran a sweatshop...</i>

<i>What do you want, huh?</i>

<i>...for illegal immigrants?</i>

<i>You want money?</i>

<i>I'll get you money, I'll get you</i>

<i>anything you want, just fucking</i>

<i>tell me.</i>

<i>Just listen to me, just</i>

<i>answer the question, O.K.?</i>

<i>Just answer the question.</i>

<i>Just concentrate.</i>

<i>Say you're sorry.</i>

<i>Just apologize.</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>

<i>Just fucking, just please.</i>

<i>O. K.</i>

<i>O. K., o. K.</i>

<i>Just say you're sorry. I'm sorry...</i>

<i>Too much.
Too little, too late.</i>

<i>He said he was sorry.</i>

<i>Before you go, we would</i>

<i>like to leave you with a small</i>

<i>reminder of our time together.</i>

<i>El toro has prepared something</i>

<i>to dull the pain.</i>

<i>Would you like the injection</i>

<i>now or after?</i>

<i>Now.</i>

<i>I really have to commend</i>

<i>you, Travis.</i>

<i>You're a fast learner,</i>

<i>a survivor.</i>

<i>If only the rest of the group</i>

<i>would have followed your</i>

<i>example.</i>

<i>What about you?</i>

<i>You want an injection?
Now, that's my type of girl.</i>

<i>Give it a couple of days,</i>

<i>goldilocks, you'll be fine.</i>

<i>What did you...</i>

<i>What did, what did you give me?</i>

<i>You like it, huh?</i>

<i>Hey, come on.</i>

<i>O. K.</i>

<i>It smells.</i>

<i>Give me the camera.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>We couldn't send you off without</i>

<i>a real wrap party, huh?</i>

<i>El toro... Musica!</i>

<i>Yes!</i>

<i>It's a party! Do it right.</i>

<i>Ahh... â™ª come over.</i>

<i>Travis, no.</i>

<i>No-no-no!</i>

<i>Hold it up.</i>

<i>Travis, no.</i>

<i>There we go.</i>

<i>There's someone in there.</i>

<i>Travis, there's someone</i>

<i>in there.</i>

<i>One more!</i>

<i>It's Jim.</i>

<i>One more!</i>

<i>No, Travis, no, no, no!</i>

<i>It's Jim!</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, no, no...</i>

<i>No, let me go!</i>

<i>Liz!</i>

<i>So close.</i>

<i>Ay-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi.</i>

<i>There you go.</i>

Gracias. Take it easy.</i>

<i>...what did I do?</i>

<i>What did I do?</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Shh.</i>

<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

<i>I so fucked up.</i>

<i>Shh... I did.</i>

<i>I fucked up.</i>

<i>No, it's O.K.</i>

<i>It's all right.</i>

<i>You did everything you could.</i>

<i>I know, I know. No.</i>

<i>Z wants to see you.</i>

<i>Just her.</i>

<i>I said...</i>

<i>Mother... fucker!</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>

<i>Fuck you.</i>

<i>Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!</i>

<i>Fuck you, you fucker!</i>

<i>Travis, grab the keys.</i>

<i>Grab the keys.</i>

<i>What the hell happened?</i>

<i>What happened?</i>

<i>I'm unloading the truck, I hear</i>

<i>shit going down.</i>

<i>Klaus is out cold, and they</i>

<i>- Idiot!</i>- <i>You wanna go home?</i>

<i>Casa?</i>

<i>You want to go home, casa?</i>

<i>Where they hiding?</i>

<i>Just point.</i>

<i>You can see your family.</i>

<i>- You want to go home?
We're wasting time!</i>

<i>Ninos, you want to see...</i>

We're wasting time! Lock the exits.

Come on, run.

Which one of them shot you?

He did.

Rip your fucking jaw off!

If you catch them, don't fuck up

that bitch's face, man.

I need it for that thing.

I just want him. I
want them both dead.

Go, go, go, go.

You got it?

Yeah, I got it.

There we go.

Where the fuck were you?

Shit.

Hurry up, what the fuck you doing?

Come on.

<i>Oh, shit. All right, look at me.
Ven aqui.</i>

<i>Go, go, go, fuck.</i>

<i>It's O.K.</i>

<i>It's O.K. I got-- come on.
Ugh, fuck, go.</i>

<i>Hey, Remy,</i>

<i>make sure that the South gate's</i>

<i>locked up.</i>

<i>Fuck.</i>

<i>Shit!</i>

<i>They're over here, Remy! </i>

<i>Get in the car.</i>

<i>Go.</i>

<i>Shit!</i>

<i>Travis, he's coming!</i>

<i>Holy motherfucker!</i>

<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

<i>This was unfortunate.</i>

<i>You'll have to, uh, excuse</i>

<i>this prerecorded message.</i>

<i>There are matters elsewhere that</i>

<i>require our attention.</i>

<i>By the way, I hope you don't</i>

<i>mind, we kept some of the</i>

<i>footage for ourselves...</i>

<i>As recruiting videos.</i>

<i>America may be a nation of</i>

<i>immigrants, but it's not</i>

<i>a landfill.</i>

<i>Give us your tired, your poor,</i>

<i>your huddled masses yearning to</i>

<i>breathe free. And we'll give
'em back to you. In pieces.</i>

<i>The fight to control</i>

<i>illegal immigration isn't just</i>

<i>on our border.</i>

<i>In a few months,</i>

<i>president Obama will push</i>

<i>legislation to legalize the</i>

<i>nation's 12-million ill--</i>

<i>Too often in law</i>

<i>enforcement we see individuals</i>

<i>that are getting arrested for</i>
