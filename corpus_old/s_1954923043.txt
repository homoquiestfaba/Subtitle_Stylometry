What's up, dog?

What up?

You bring the money?

Hell yeah.

I got three bucks.

We have five bucks.

That's not enough for
a six-pack.

Six pack?

Damn, Beetle, you so fancy.
You want to drink it

from a glass slipper,
too? Or, how about

I serve it to you on a nice,
velvet pillow?

Shut up, Joker.

I don't like that nasty-ass
malt liquor you drink.

Dude, two 40s we'll be cool.
It's enough, too, man, I

thought you wanted to catch a
buzz.

All right, whatever.
Whatever, whatever.

Go ask that guy right there.

Man quit being a wussy
and go ask him shy boy.

I'm not gonna
ask him, you ask him.

Come on, he's leaving.

Well go talk to him then, quick.

Never mind, it's too late.

I'll ask the next
person that comes by.

Hey, Sharky.

What's up, Sharky?

What's up, suckers?

How much we got, fools?

This.

Joker says he's gonna ask
the next person that comes by.

And that's you, Sharky.
You right on point, dog.

Sheesh. Leave
it to the master, fools.

Look at that...
You fools just watch.

Cup check.

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoooooo!

I'll ask anything
from anyone, any time.

That's how I get what I want.
Not like you fools

standing there holding your
nuts.

Oh, shit. It's Coach.

Go ask him, Sharky.

It's summer vacation,
he's got no authority over us now.

Nah man, but camp
starts in a few days.

Nah, just be cool, be cool.

Rodriguez. Hope you
take care of that arm.

You're gonna need it this
season.

You know it, Coach. I feel good.

Good, good, son.
What are you guys up to?

Just hanging out, Coach.

Just hanging out?

Yup, hanging out.

Yeah, just chillin.

Chillin, huh?

Chilly-chill. Chilled out.
Just chillin' like a cold beer...

which I don't drink.
We don't drink beer...

Come on, guys. I know
what you guys are up to.

I was your age once.
You want someone to

score you some beer that has ID?

What? Oh, beer? Nooo!
No Coach, we're under age!

Give me the money. Give
me the money, I'll get the beer.

You serious?

You want the beer or not?

What, do you think I'm running
an undercover sting operation?

NERVOUS LAUGHTER

Just give me the money.

All right, here you go.

So you guys want,
a 12-pack or something?

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
a 12-pack would be cool.

Did that just happen?

Can you believe that, ay?

The man is buying us some beer.

Oh, yeah.

This is gonna
be the best summer ever.

Oh, shit.

Cool, just be cool man.
Just be cool.

We're just, we're waiting for
our ride, all right...

we're just waiting for our ride.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Don't look at him.

He's looking right at us.

I'm texting.

Don't look at him.

Don't look suspicious.

Texting's not suspicious.

He's looking right at us.

JOKER;
Bro, don't move. Stop moving.

Oh my God he's got a big gun.
That's a big gun.

Woah!

Oh man! You got scared!

No! You got scared!
Bro, I was looking -

Yo, both of you got scared.

I was just stretching, man.

Man, I went like this.
I went like this.

Sir... Man I was pitching!
I was just stretching my arm out.

You know? Whoosh!

Whatever, you were sketch.

Scared, dude!

Hey, here comes your
Coach, here comes Coach.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.

Here comes, here comes.

One for me, and this
one's for you gentlemen.

Got you my favorite brand.

All right thanks Coach!
Good looking out!

Sharky, this
is non-alcoholic beer.

What? For real? Oh,
hell, no, that's not cool.

Man, this is
the last of our money.

I thought he was being cool.
He's culero. Forget what I said.

Coach we hate your guts!
We think you suck!

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, Coach, whassup?
Why you gotta do us like that?

Rodriguez, I'm doing you a favor.
You're a good athlete.

But you're smarter than that.
You could be somebody.

Hang out with these 2 clowns,
trying to score beer,

you're not gonna get anywhere.

Yo, first of all coach,
those 2 clowns over there -

those are my homies, right?
And I'll tell you right now

I am somebody and I don't need
your pinche validation or your

stupid-ass non-alcoholic beer.

Don't you understand
it, just control yourself!

Man, get off me! Psssh!

That's it. You're
cut from the team.

Yo, have fun
with that magazine, huh?

Don't even worry
about coming to camp, son.

Freeze!

SHRIEKING

You once had a
wet dream about Mr. T.

And that's true and you know it.

Bullshit.

Remember that time we went
on a class field trip to Yosemite?

When we were, like, 12?

That's right. Remember,
you woke up screaming one night,

saying Mr. T. was gonna get you
from behind cabron.

I remember. No,
no, that was a nightmare.

I had a dream that I stole
Mr. T's van and he was

gonna put the hurt on me.

But anyway, moron, that's
not what a wet dream means.

Whatever you say
puto I guess Mr. T.

Was just putting

a hurting on you.

My god, can you
both of you just shut up?

Look, I just got
kicked off the team.

I lost my bat, my glove. You ask
me, both of y'all are gay.

I've never seen either
one of you with a girl.

Either that or
you're both virgins.

Shit no, I ain't no virgin!

I got laid last
summer in church camp.

Humping your Mayor McCheese
pillow doesn't count, Joker.

Look, fool, there's Felicia.

All right, cool, Beetle,
she ain't gonna bite you.

She ain't no Mr. T, but you got
to give girls a try sometime.

Is that Beetle?

Yeah. Hey, Beetle. What's up?

She sees you. She's
waving, wave back, fool.

Hi, Felicia.

MUSIC OUT

Oh my god.

Are you all right, Beetle?

What's up, man?

I'll survive.

Direct hit.

We're gonna be over there.

Oh, my god, are you okay?

Yeah. Ow.

You have... let me see.

What happened?

I got a boo-boo.

Damn, Beetle.
You got really banged up.

I'm okay, it only hurts
when I move any part of my body.

I'm serious. Beetle.
I'm worried about you.

Why would you
be worried about me?

Beetle, I've known
you since like first grade.

And you're always
so nice and so smart.

And you probably
don't know this,

but I used to copy your answers
in Mr. Gamba's class.

I knew it.

Hahahaha.

Having you lean over my
left shoulder was the best thing

that ever happened to me in
the 5th grade.

Oh, ow.

Careful. Where does it hurt?

Oh, not there, a little lower.

Here?

Not there, a
little to the right.

Here?

No, just a little bit lower.

Ow.

Beetle, you're such a dog.

I'm just playing.
Help me up. Ow.

So what are you and your friends
doing for the rest of the day?

FELICIA We're going to my
house, we're gonna to swimming.

You got a pool?

Hm? You guys should come over.
My parents are out of town so...

Yeah, ok, yeah, sure.
We, yeah, we can come over.

You want us to bring anything?

You think you can
score some Booze Farms?

Yeah, of course I can.

Ok, well, we took a
collection, so get some drinks and then

we'll see you at my
house in like about an hour?

Ok. All right. Sounds good.
All right. Bye, Felicia.

Yo, Sharky, Joker.

End Barrio Warfare. End
Barrio Warfare, End Barrio Warfare.

This guy.

End Barrio Warfare.
Oh, whassup, little homies?

Watcha.

We're having a picnic
at the park coming up.

It's for End Barrio Warfare
project. You guys should

swing by, check it out. You

Yeah, sure.

I'm a lover, not a fighter.

Orale, that's what
I like to hear, esse.

Hey, big homie.

What's that?

Hey, if we promise
to stay out of gangs,

you think you can do a
little something for us?

Oh, yeah? What's
that, little homie?

Yo hey, could
you score us some booze?

Are you vatos out
of your pinches minds?

Don't you know
alcohol kills you?

That'll shrivel your liver.
Shrink your dick.

Make you do things
you regret forever.

One minute you're
doing drive-bys,

and the next you're making
out with vatos in a van.

And no one knows how
that shit got started.

No one.

So that's... give me this!
Give me my flyers back.

MUSIC UP

Oh, damn. Guys, I
think I forgot something,

I got to go do some shopping.

Yeah, shopping. Come
on, Beetle, let's go shopping.

Ok.

MUSIC OUT

Damn, she's hot.

I don't know, she
might be out of our league.

Oh, hell, no, not for Sharky.

Sharky's a man, he gets

more poontang than
Ellen De Generous.

All right, I'm going in.

If you're making a
salad, may I make a suggestion?

A suggestion?
Sure, babe, what is it?

You should try
the fresh zucchini,

rather than the cucumber.
It's an aphrodisiac.

Oh really? You
know, I really love zucchini.

Oh, now do you?

Do you know
what I like to do with a big,

fat, juicy zucchini
just like this one?

Oh... What's that?

I like to take it in my hands.

Oh, that's nice.

And then I
take a big, nice, knife.

What, a knife?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, whatcha
gonna do with the knife?

I'm gonna slice it up,

sautee it in butter, I
never thought about using a

zucchini in a salad before.

Hold on. If
I didn't know any better,

I'd think you were
coming on to me.

What? Me? Come on to you? No.

Oh, excuse me.

No, no. I'm just, no,
I'm saying, I was just gonna

ask a favor of you. Um.

Me and my friends were
trying to score some booze,

and I lost my ID.

You lost your ID?

Yeah. That's it.

How old are you, kid?

Oh, I'm of age. I promise you.

I mean, normally I wouldn't
even make a big deal about

something like this.

My friend, Beetle's
shipping off to Iraq

tomorrow, and you
know, it's just uh.

It's crazy.

Oh, dear. He is?
Where are your friends now?

Beetle. Joker.
They're over there.

Yeah, yeah, the big one's
Joker and the skinny one's.

Beetle.

Hi.

Hi.

We're just getting some apples.

So we... to go

Mmm hmm, I see.

Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.

Hey, not so fast, mister.

If I agree to get
your booze for you,

you have to carry my
groceries home for me. Deal?

Yeah. Deal.

Ok. And I'll take
the zucchini, uh, suggestion.

I'm telling you,
you won't regret it.

Oh. Yes, yes, yes.

Just put the stuff over there.

And uh you boys can just help
yourself to whatever you want

in the refrigerator.

And you. You can come with me.

Big old titties!

What the hell? This
Build a Bear workshop or something?

Hmmm.

So, what's up?

Uhm, uh ya know, I'm old

We'll see about that.
Oh, you have a nice body.

Why don't you

Oh, wait oh, those feel nice.

Wait, what about my friends?

You mean the
one that's going to Iraq?

Uhm yeah, that one.

Uh-huh. Well,

I'll take care of them later.
I want you all to myself.

Well-

Mmmmmmm.

I'll be right back.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

If you're gonna go out there,
give this to them to put on.

Come right back.

Ok.

Ok?

Um.

Dude. Hey, I bet Sharky's
banging that MILF right now.

You think so, man?

Oh, yeah.

Hey, hey Joker.

Check this out.

Oh yea!

Grab my ears!
Oh yeah what's my name?

Oh yeah!

Finish me! Finish me!

What are you idiots doing?
Put that shit down man.

This lady's hot for us.

She's all over me, man.

Oh, and check this out.

She wants all of us to do her.

What?

Oh, this is it, Beetle.

You ready?

Well, what are we waiting for?

Let's go bone her already, Bro.

I'm ready for action.

Oh, no, just cool your jets,

Joker, look. I'm gonna go in

my business. I'm gonna come
back out, get you guys,

but you got to be ready. All
right? So take your clothes off

I'm ready.

Are you serious? What is this?

She wants you

You ready to be a man?

Yeah. Hell, yeah. Yes.

All right, good, stop
acting like a little bitch.

I know, Beetle.

Oh, hey, and if she asks,

off to Iraq tomorrow.

Cool?

Sir, yes sir.

Private Joker
reporting for duty sir.

Take off your clothes, Beetle.

I'm going, man.

Come on, just put your
legs through it, hurry up.

Like this? What the hell?

Oooh.

It's not like that, like this.

Close the door. Come on in.

That's right. Come to Mommy.
I won't bite.

Unless you want me to.

Come on.

Mmm, you're gonna be a lot of
fun to play with...

Mmm-hmm!

MUSIC OUT

Take your clothes off, sweetie.

Oh shit, he's gonna
get some sweet pupusa pie.

You'd better wear this.

I don't think so.

Sharky's a freeballer.
What a daredevil.

I thought you and
your friends wanted to have fun?

I guess I'll just have
to put my clothes back on.

Sharky, just put on the condom.

No, no, no wait.
Here, let me put it on.

YES!

Ooooo, it feels so good. Damn.

We're definitely
going to get laid!

MOANS CAN BE HEARD

MUSIC UP

Honey? You ok?

SCREAMS!

COP Dammit, Nadine.
Not the bunny suit.

Stop or I'll shoot.

GUNFIRE IS HEARD.

MUSIC OUT

GIRLS PERVERTS!

Hell, no. This
ain't that kind of party.

Wait Felicia.

We're running for
our lives right now.

What are you talking about?

He's gonna kill us.

Who's gonna kill you?

Don't listen to them. These
guys are way out of line, Felicia.

It was the Mafiosos. They
tried to jack us but we got away.

Is that what those shots were?

Oh my god Beetle, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

Yeah, but I
could use some pants.

I'll get you my dad's pants.
All right.

Nice bunny suit.

Wanna stroke
my leg for good luck?

Put them on.

I'm gonna find you. Trying
to screw my wife when i'm at work!

Get out.

BEETLE Wait.

All three of you.

Get out of here Beetle!

Get out...

Can I at least get a hot dog?
Ok. Ow.

Can't believe it.

Damn, the sidewalk's hot.

Damn, the foil
is roasting my nuts.

You guys realize that
once the story gets out,

I don't have to worry
about my senior year,

'cos I won't be getting
laid 'til I'm a senior citizen.

You're just being dramatic.
Hey, where you going?

That's a good idea, Beetle.

I don't want to be a fricking
virgin for the rest of my life.

Look, relax, Beetle.
I got an idea.

All right, let's just get
off the street before anybody

else sees us. Catch you guys
later, all right?

Damn homie, you need
an extra-large, homes.

Mrs. Ortiz? I'm
looking for your son.

Is this your son?

COP Oh.

Ma'am. I need you
to understand me.

I'm looking for your son.

Your son is in big trouble.
He's a sexual predator.

Sexo?

Yes. Sexo, sexo.

I caught him and his buddies
trying to screw my wife.

He's a pervert.
Perverso, perverso.

COP No. No badge number. I'm
not looking for any trouble.

Just let your son know
that I'm looking for him.

Suck a key to you too, lady.

Benjamin?

Yes, Mommy.

I was working out.

No, Mom, stop.

Told you, I was out working out.
I'm trying out for wrestling

next year, and I got to
make the weight.

The cops came here?

No, Mom, no problems.
Why did they come?

Huh. Mom, why
are you wearing that?

How many times have I told
you, if you can't read English,

don't wear these shirts.

That's probably what
the cop was talking about, Mom.

Oh.

Dang, I cant
play in these boots.

That's H-O-R for you, son.

Always knew
you were a big whore.

Screw you, buddy boy.

You ruined Easter
for me forever.

Hey, that cop
really go to your pad?

Yeah. I guess he found
my ID in my pants or something.

Just a matter of time
before he busts me.

Busts you for what
that his wife's a nympho.

Worst thing he'll probably
do is whoop your ass.

Thanks, man.

The worst thing is that
those are my best pants.

I know, and my shoes?

Look at these raggedy-ass kicks.

How'm I suppose to
find girls wearing these?

Yo, relax.

Didn't I tell you
guys I got a plan?

Your last plan
almost got us shot.

You know what, never mind, then.

You guys are too immature
for this, anyway.

What are you talking about,
I could grow a mustache in 3 days.

He gets it from his mother.

Whatever, dude.

You're just mad 'cos
you're hung like a toddler.

Shut up, puto, it's your shot.

Hey, and don't blame your
Banda boots this time.

Ha-ha.

Damn!

Look if we pull this off,
we're guaranteed to get laid, 100%.

One hundred
percent - even Joker.

Even Joker.

Even me?

Hell, yeah.

Man, I hope you're
not talking about a hooker.

No, I'm not talking
about some common streetwalkers.

I'm talking about classy ladies
who know how to treat a man.

And where are we
supposed to find them?

You ever heard of a
place called Lola's Love Shack?

Man, that place ain't real.

Yeah, I heard they closed
that place down years ago.

Not true, my brothers, not true.
The place went underground, but

it's still around. We just got to
figure out where they moved to.

And how we supposed to do that?

You know you guys
sound like a bunch of pussies right now?

Look, I'm telling you the place
is real, and it's

just waiting for us.

We just need some fake ID's and
we will be treated like kings.

Like kings?

Well, in your case,
like a dirty little princess.

Oh, you got me on
that one, Cotton Tail.

Well, how'd you
find out about this place?

You know, my brother
used to tell me about it.

Before he got sent
up to the Pinta.

You know, but all the old
men in the neighborhood here?

They know about it, but
they keep it hush-hush,

'cos they know it's
some sweet shit.

Look, I'm telling you virgins,
you want to become men?

This is the best way. But if you
want to keep playing pocket pool

and dreaming about Felicia, then
go right ahead.

Ha-ha-ha.

All right. I'm down with it.

I'm in, too. Ok, guys,
this right here is for the ladies.

HORSE!

Oh, wait wait wait, Mafiosos.

Mafiosos. Here comes Trouble.

Oh man, yo guys, just be cool,
all right I'm gonna handle this.

Hey, whassup, Trouble?

What's going on, little vatos.

Whatchu looking at?

Nothing.

Let me talk to you
over here, little homie.

All right.

I like your tattoo, man.

Man shut up, ain't
nobody talking to you. Shut up.

Yo, whassup, Trouble?

Why you hang around
with these fools anyway?

Oh, man, those
guys are like my brothers.

Your brothers? Look,
your brother was one of us,

all right, your real brother.
I heard you got jumped today.

What? No, man,
I didn't get jumped.

Oh, really? I heard
you got your ass handed to you,

and don't be insulting my
intelligence, all right?

Who got your back? We do.
And if you ever need anything,

you give me a call, all right?
We got you.

Oh man that's cool. You
know but everything's handled man.

I'm straight.

Oh, really? Is that why you
got caught in your chonies today?

You know, it's real dangerous
out there, homie.

You better think about it.

Yeah. I mean,
yeah, you're right.

I am right. You take
care of yourself, all right?

Cool.

Stay away from them clowns, man.
They ain't no good.

Yeah, aight.

They're no good.

Hey, homies,
let's roll out of here.

What'd they want?

Oh, nothing, man.

They just... they just think
'cos my brother got jumped

into their gang, that I
will, too.

We got your back, bro.

Yeah, ok. All right, look.

So tomorrow, we get our
fake IDs if we're gonna

accomplish this mission.

They're gonna be $50 each. Cool?

Give me a sweet
poon-tang on three.

Three.

Sweet poon-tang.

You're late for rehearsal, Mijo.

I know, I'm sorry Pop.

And you're wearing your
Banda boots outside the house!

You know they're
strictly for competition.

Now go get dressed, Mijo.

We got a big show at the swap
meet coming up.

It's about time. Ok, places
everyone.

Remember, focus. Smile.
Ok, how many counts was that?

5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8.

Turn.

And again.

MUSIC CONTINUES

PHONE RINGS

Oh, shit. Felicia.

Hey, Beetle.

Hey.

Beetle, I am so sorry. I
just wanted to call to apologize.

What?

Sharky told me what you did.

He did?

Yep.

I think it's pretty cool.

And you're a good friend
to risk your life like that.

I am?

Yeah. He told me how you
waited outside when they went in, and

how you even tackled the cop
when he tried to shoot Sharky.

Sharky told you this?

Yeah. Why didn't you tell me?

I didn't want to brag about it.

Anyhow, I, I
just wanted to apologize.

Is there any way I
can make it up to you?

I don't know. It's pretty
jacked up, sending us out there wrapped

in foil like that.

I know. I'm so sorry.

Well, what are
you doing tomorrow?

Nothing.

You want to meet
up at the park tomorrow,

like you can bring
your friends if you want.

Ok.

Uhhh... 3:30?

Ok. See you there.

Ok. Bye, Felicia.

Yes. Mom!

I need you to iron my
clothes real quick.

Ah, Vieja, You make
the best chili rellenos.

They're delicious, Mom.

Im glad you like them. Octavio?

You barely touched your food!
Is something wrong?

Well, I kind of have a problem.

What is it?

Well, I don't have any money.
I need like $50.

What do you need $50 for?

For a date.

$50 for a date?
What is wrong with you?

Can't you just take
her for a walk

around the block or something?

A walk?

Calmate Viejo.

Girls, girls, girls.
When are you gonna learn?

Banda first, and the
girls will follow.

How do you think I
got your mother?

Oye, Octavio.

I earned this money
on the lottery ticket.

I was gonna put this money in
the jar for our gazebo fund.

This is just one step closer
to building a gazebo in our

backyard, so we can play our
Banda music and have parties.

You know, great fun
for the whole family.

But if you think it's more
important to spend this money

on some girl, then you can be
selfish and take this money

for your date.

Son of a...

Damn, that sucked.

Man, I can't believe
you trusted that cholo.

He took the last of my bus fare.

We're screwed now.

Maybe we're just not
meant to have fake IDs.

Maybe we just have to rely
on our natural abilities

in order to compete in
the sexual food chain.

Man, you watch
so much nature channel.

Boys!

'Sup?

'Sup Paletas?

You know, I've been
watching you boys for a while now.

Let me ask you something.

Why are you guys so desperate to
get these IDs, huh?

It's a long story.

Our friend,
Beetle, here is a virgin.

Oh, I see.

And we need to take
him to Lola's Love Shack to

get his old sour cherry popped.

Lola's Love Shack.
Yup. That's where I found my 1st amor.

Yeah, she gave me
the gift of love.

But anyway, that's
what the doctor said.

Lola's is just
a dream for us now.

Let me see, now. I
hate to see three fine young boys like

you guys go out without love.
You know what?

I'm gonna hook you guys up.

Hook us up with what?

Fake ID's, stupid.
What do you think-I sell ice cream?

Pendejo

I got to make a living somehow,
buddy. You know what I mean?

All right, first, we
need to get some pictures.

Wait, we just got robbed,
though, we don't have any money.

Hey, y'all hold up, Beetle.

I like to keep my money where
no one will look for it.

But I thought
he got your wallet?

No, man, I just keep a
couple of bucks in there as a decoy.

But I like to keep my big
piggy bank tucked

right underneath my ball sac.

It's a little sweaty, but
it's just the top layer.

Boy, that is disgusting.

Lucky for you, I'm a romantic.

So I'll take the cash
for the pictures.

Hell yeah.

Back up, back up. All right.

Just gonna get some
pictures over here.

Who's first?

Beetle.

All right, buddy.

Uh, listen, don't look so
serious,

you look like a refugee.

Smile a little bit.
There you go.

Damn, these look real.

Mine says Chase P. Nocha.

What name did you use?

Oliver Coochie, coz
that's all I'm gonna settle for.

And I'm Sal T. Huevos.

That means I got the cojones.

Sounds more like you
gotta air out your nuts.

Man, look who's talking!

I can't believe that
guy even took your money.

You nasty.

Guys, will these IDs even work?

There's only
one way to find out.

Hey, there's Lucy Loose Lips.

I heard they call her
that 'cos she talks so much.

Dude, you're an idiot.

They call her that because she
blew the entire wrestling team.

Dumb ass.

What do we do, Sharky?

All right, Beetle,
looks like you're up to bat.

Go see if she wants to
have some drinks with us.

Hey, why do you
always send this fool first?

I got more game than him.

Not even, fool.

Dude, he's never gotten any.

You said you ain't a virgin.

Oh, yeah.

Let the virgin go first.

Hey, Sharky.

Yo, what's up?

What does it
feel like to get laid?

You, too, huh?

I knew it, fool.

Watch and learn.

Jonas Brothers,
they're pretty good.

Are you into them or what?

All right, you know what?

Forget you, then.

The Jonas Brothers...

they should be called The Bone
Us Brothers, 'cos they

look like they want it up the
butt from an escaped convict.

Sorry, I couldn't hear.
Were you saying something?

Oh, the Jonas Brothers.

I'm nuts for them,
like an escaped convict,

I love them.

Oh, yeah? I love, love,
love the Jonas Brothers.

Lucy, I'm
Beetle, and I was just.

You know my name?

Yeah, we go to
the same high school.

We do?

Yeah, it's cool. I mean,
well, I was just wondering

if you wanted to have a drink
with me and my friends?

You guys can score?

Hell, yeah. I've got an ID.

My god, can you
get me Booze Farms?

Yeah, sure.

I love Booze Farms.
Once, I drank a whole bottle

and totally passed out.

And I wasn't even
hung over the next day.

I'm impressed. That's awesome.

I think it's
because we mixed it.

They got cranberry, mixed it
with grape. They call it crape.

But you don't have to get both,
just grape is fine.

Ok.

Do you like grape?

Yeah. I'll be right back, ok?

Ok.

All right.

Hey. It was really
good running into you.

Yeah.

I'm gonna need to see some ID.

Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Here you go.

Oliver Coochie?

It's pronounced Kee-yoo-chee.

Ky-oochie?

Q-Chee.

Coo-Chee.

Q-cheeee.

Coochie.

Coochie.

Coochie.

Yeah, that's it. Kewchi.

Coochie.

That'll be twelve dollars.

It should all be in there.

Thank you.

Have a good day, Mr. Coochie.

Yeah, you too.

If you guys want
to have sex with me,

you have to wear a rubber.

And one at a time, ok?
I'm not a skank.

Huddle.

I don't know, guys.
I wouldn't touch it.

If I were you, I wouldn't
touch it either.

Yeah, I'm gonna
wait 'til Felicia gets here.

Oh, she's coming here man?
She bringing her friends?

I don't give a damn. I'm
gonna go for it right now,.

Damn, fool, you
don't even have a condom.

What you think I'm an idiot?

Dumb ass, this is a wet nap.

Come on you guys, are
we gonna screw or what?

Hold on one second.

I don't care,
I'm going for it. Move.

Come here. Show me
what you're working with.

No, you take off your top first.

Ok.

Don't be shy Joker.

Just go to sleep.

Awwwe...

My head it spinning.

You all right?

Oh.

Screwed up with the coach, man.

So what, man? Screw that guy.

Yeah, screw him, Screw
me, screw everybody. I'm screwed.

Ah Sharky, it's just a game man,

It's just a game, buddy.

Man, get off me, man.

Just a game.

Hey, what time is it?

It's like 3:30.

Oh shit, she's
gonna be here, soon, dude.

Right on, dog.

Hey, what about Joker?

Well, what about him? Leave him.

Yo man, we got to stop him.

No, man.

I gotta stop him, man.

He's cool, man, he's cool.

Wait. Joker, you better
rethink this, man. Joker, Joker. Hey.

Hey, you better put your
pants on, big boy.

Your date's passed out.

What are you doing, dick head?

You trying to pull my pants on,
I'll pull your pants down.

I'm trying to put
your pants back on, look.

Your date's passed out, and
you're about to bone her

with a wet nap.

Oh, shit, Beetle. You saved me.

I love you. You're my favorite
homie.

Yeah, I'm your favorite?

Oh, you saved me from
making a terrible mistake,

Beetle. My chorizo could
have dried up,

shriveled away or something.

Yeah. You need
to get up, though.

No, no.

You should get dressed, man.

My pants are down.

Oh, my god.

You are a pervert.
Have fun with your tramp.

Wait, Felicia. It's not
what it looks like, I promise you.

I'm just tired of your stories.

You're just a complete dog.

Oh. Beetle.

Well, I guess that does it.
Felicia will never

ever talk to me again.

Forget about Felicia.

Forget about Felicia.

I don't want to.

There's plenty of
ho's out there, Beetle.

Look, at least our ID's worked.

Now we can get into Lola's.

How are we gonna
get the money for that?

I don't know. But
we're gonna roll up in style.

Hey guys, I feel better now,

I puked it all out.
I feel great.

Your breath
smells like Lucy's ass.

So what, your breath
smells like Hobo Dick.

Ok, ladies. I got
something to show you.

Check it out.

Damn, this is nice.

That is bad ass, Sharky.

Yeah, it's my brother's.
I mean, he ain't using it.

Needs a little work.

Yeah, we fix this up, we're
gonna get the royal treatment.

I'm sorry I
ever doubted you, man.

This is bad-ass. We're gonna
get laid for sure now.

So. The faith is back?

Hell yeah. Hey,
I just got an idea.

I know how we can get the
money to fix up the car

and go to Lola's Love Shack.

How we gonna get
that kind of money?

What are you
talking about dumb ass?

This is the land of opportunity.

In this country, if you want
something, you get it.

Doesn't matter if you're short,

fat, skinny, white,
brown, black.

Legal or illegal.

If you want something,
you get it.

You want to get laid?
No, we will get laid.

We will go to Lola's
Love Shack tomorrow.

Are you serious?

You guys should be
at my place at 5AM tomorrow,

bring some work clothes.

Get ready to live
the American Dream.

This ain't no American dream.

It's more like a
Mexican nightmare.

Hey, hey. Whatever
buys a dream, buddy. Right?

Simone.

All right.

Right. Right here, right
here, right here.

Hey, guys. I need ten
guys, fifty bucks a day,

anybody here speak English?

I do, Senior.
Me speak-a the English.

All right. Do me a favor, ask
these guys if any of them have

any experience with
demolition and clean-up?

Ok, yeah, yeah.

So sorry Senior.

What's he saying?

He needs higher wages.

Higher wages?
Are you shitting me?

All right, I'll tell you
what, tell 'em $70

is as high as I can go.

He wants a hundred.

A hundred?

Senior, trust me.
We work twice as hard.

We get the job done.

All right, load 'em up.

All right, everyone's getting
their seat belts on?

MUSIC OUT

All right, man, great job today.
You really earned this.

Here you are.

Thank you, sir.

Good work.

Thank you.

Great job.

Got to hand it to you, Beetle.
You're a clever man.

I think I'll be a sports agent

and negotiate your
contracts for you.

Sh, you're hired, homie.

Now I can afford
a new silk shirt.

Now you can afford
to get some boxers and shit.

Get rid of those
banana hammocks.

So what? At least
I can fill them up.

You can't fill
up a peanut shell.

Shut up, fool.

No, no, no it's all good.

Thank you friend, thank you.

Hey man. You
know what you did for us?

Any time you need
us, you call me, ok?

Ok.

Gracias. Gracias.

That guy likes you.

Lola's Love Shack, here we go.

Oh, let's roll.

I'm gonna go to her
and tell her like this.

I want you to go
down on me, girl.

I want you to do me right.

Then, I'm gonna put it in
her grill and I'm like oh,

yeah, oh, yeah.

Oh God, I'm coming, I'm
coming. Oh.

Hey, you morons stop playing
around while I'm down there?

All right, well, that's it.
Beetle, fire it up.

Hey. Let's go tonight.

How much we got?

This much.

Ok, that won't get us
a midget's nipple at Lola's.

You know what, guys?
You guys stepped up.

So now it's time for me to step
it up, too. Trust me, guys.

I know where to get the money.

Tomorrow, we'll be Don Juans,

because we're gonna do it
'til they don juan no more.

All right, just
don't say that to the girls,

all right, man? Hey, man.
I'm just telling you.

All right, ladies.

So go home, get some
rest, for tomorrow,

you will be men.

Sweet poon-tang on
three right here.

Three.

Sweet Poon-tang.

Sharky. Whassup, doggie?

'Sup, dog?

What are you all dressed up for?

I want to look presentable.

You look like
you're going to a funeral.

Ha-ha, looks like Los Tigres
Del Norte puked on your shirt.

The women love this look.
It's silk, see how soft it is?

Get off me. That is pretty soft.

Ok, you ladies look
very pretty tonight. Let's roll.

Let's represent, Homies.

Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

Woo hoo! Here we come!

Looks like there's nothing here.

Are you sure you
got the right directions?

Look, it's underground.
It's not supposed to be seen.

The guy said it was around here.

Look. Door. Beetle. Knock.

I'm not gonna knock.
You go knock.

Joker, knock.

Wait, and what do I say?

Just tell him like
the man said, you got a

message for Lola, right?

All right, here goes nothing.

Who is it?

I got a message for Lola?

Yeah, what's the message?

I got to tell her personally.

Go away kid,
there's no Lola here.

Oop, she's not here, let's go.

Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.
We worked way too hard to get here.

We can't just leave now.

It's the wrong place.

Good night, Mr. Morales.

See you tomorrow night, Joey.

Hey, it's Paletas. Hey Paletas!

MR, RALPH: Hey, hey, who's that?

What's up? Remember us?
You told us about this place.

Oh my god.
It's the blue balls crew!

How are you, boys?

Hey, congratulations.
You found the place, huh?

Yeah, we found it,
but he won't let us in.

Well, did you tell him
that you had a message for Lola?

Yeah, I told him that.

And did you mention
that Benjamin Franklin

wanted to talk to her?

No.

MR, RALPH: Pandejos. Boys.
A little money goes a long way, huh?

Come on, snap out of it.
Look, I got to go.

Lola doesn't like crowds hanging
around the place, hey?

Good luck. Get laid.

Thanks, man.

All right. You heard the man.
Let's get inside.

Knock, buey.

You again?

Yeah, we have
a message for Lola.

From Benjamin Franklin.

Well, what is it?

I got a boner
that needs your guidance.

You little punk.
I'm gonna bash your face in.

Hey, what he meant to
say is that he wants to tip you.

Generously.

You better cool
it with the smart-ass shit.

You got me? Come on.
Ok, this is how it's gonna go.

You're gonna go up there through
those doors and see Lola.

You do exactly what
she tells you to do.

She will introduce - don't touch
that. Don't touch anything.

All right. And then she'll
introduce you to the girls.

You boys are over 18, right?

Of course we are.

Yeah, yeah,
show me your ID, my man.

I'm 23, though.

Uh, yeah, I'm
gonna hang onto these.

You can pick 'em
up on the way out.

You got it, boss.

Go upstairs. Go.

Don't touch nothing,
you little shits.

This is weird.

This is not how I imagined it.

Where are the girls?

Somebody has a message for me?

Yeah. I have a boner
that needs your guidance.

Well, you boys got money?

Sure do.

Put it on the table.
What do you want?

We want to meet
some of your girls.

Well, you found the place.
And you got in.

But I mean, I don't
know who sent you.

So I'm gonna have to
do a test. Drop your pants.

I don't know lady, we
put the money on the table.

We just want to meet the girls.

You either drop your pants,
or you go back home to your mamas.

All right. Fine.
Let's just do it, guys.

Oh, ok. Not bad.

That tickles.

Oh, very impressive.

Thank you.

And even a haircut.

Thank you.

Can you lift up your stomach?

What do you think you're
gonna do with that?

I'm a grower, not a show-er.

I'm sorry, sonny.
Even my girls have standards.

Come on, lady. We didn't
come here to get insulted.

We just want to meet
some of your girls.

All right. Buddy.
You got it. Chicas.

Sharky, what do you want to do?

I don't know, pick one.

All right. Uhm I'll
take that one on the right.

That's the one I wanted.

Fine, I'll pick another one.

Well, we can share
if you want, Beetle.

Get off of me.

I want to remember
this as a good time,

not be scarred for life.

Fine, then which
one do you choose?

I'll take her.

I don't know which one to pick.
My leg's shaking. Uhm.

We're gonna have a
two-for-one special tonight.

Now, these girls are identical
in every way. Except one.

Two for one? Oh my God I
love this place. I'll take them.

Hey, Mina, Cherry, twins,
show these men to the back room.

Can I ask you a question?

Sure.

Do you like my boobs?

I think it's cute how they
point in different directions.

Do they feel natural?

They feel great.

Oh. So cute.

Hmmm. Oh, ladies, I'm
going to do things to you

you've never had done before.

Oh, you mean you're gonna.

Um. No. Not that.

You mean you're
gonna pay us double?

Not that, either... Yeah...

You're beautiful.

Oh, thanks. I
really like your shirt.

It's so soft.

Look. I got you something.

Oh. What?

It comes from a clam.

I think you mean oyster.

Really?

Thanks. But you shouldn't have.

Sharky said you'll
love a pearl necklace.

Oh. You're so cute.
But you really shouldn't be here.

No, I really like you. It's just
you really should be going.

It's Lola.

What was that?

That means we gotta go.

But we'll be right back.
So get ready for us, ok?

Ok, I'm ready.

Oh, man, I get two of them.

Oh, my God, she loves my shirt.
She gave me her number.

I'm starting
to get nervous, guys.

What, nervous? What for?

Just do whatever comes natural.

Whassup, homie?
Whoa. Hey, man, get off me.

And I better not catch
you jag-offs back here again.

Man, open this door.

Come on, man,
let's get out of here.

Man, get off me, man.
Open this door. Get off me!

I'll burn this place down.

Come on.

Mina.

Come on.

Man, I'm never
gonna see Mina again.

Man, that was some bullshit.

You know, she never would
have played us like that if

we were rolling
with the Mafiosos.

What a dumb ass move, man.
Can't believe I even listen to you.

Well, maybe I'm not
as smart as you, Beetle.

Get off me.

Oh, shit, here
comes your stepdad.

Where the hell
did you go tonight?

What's it to you?

What's it to me?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

You think you can just go out
and do what you want, huh?

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, and now that
you fixed your brother's car,

you can go out cruising
and be like him?

I'm not like him, John.

You're a liar, Danny.
Your mother got a call today.

They said that you were kicked
off the team for drinking.

You're a loser.

You're gonna end up
in prison like Hector.

Why don't you shut your mouth?

Oh, you think you're
bad now, huh? You think -

Come on! Come on!

You little punk.

Mr. Alba? You think
we could get a ride home now?

Octavio, get
over here right now.

Where is the gazebo money?

Somebody stole it?

I found this in his pocket.

You're kidding me? You spent
the gazebo fund on hookers?

How do you know it's hookers?

Never mind how I know.
This is about Octavio.

Look how upset you made
your mother. Now sit down.

That's Sharky's.

Que cochino, Octavio.

Yeah, you like hookers.
You're a cochino.

Shut up.

Go to your room.

The entire family
is disappointed in you.

You have been
selfish and thoughtless.

And a cochino.

And a cochino.

We are seriously considering
putting you up for adoption.

Now get out of our
faces and get to your room.

You are officially
out of the Banda.

Hey, Felicia. Hello, Felicia.
Hello. Hi. Yo. Yo, Felicia.

Look, about this pervert stuff.

Hi, Felicia. You know I'm not
really a pervert, right?

I am not a pervert, Felicia.
I am not a pervert.

Oh
My god baby, it feels so good!

Oh my god, It's so big.

I know.

It scares me.

No way.

What the hell? Beetle.
What's wrong with you?

Wait a minute, I
came here today to apologize,

and you're all watching a porno.
I'm the pervert?

Would it be fair if I called
y'all a bunch of sluts?

You're not
gonna come into my house

and call me a slut.

You must be tripping.

Felicia, you just gonna
let him get away with it?

Wait a minute.
Let's hear him out.

Look, Felicia. I
know the way things are don't

make me look too good.

These are for you. Please.
Felicia. Honestly,

all I ever wanted was to
get to know you better.

You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever known,

and I swear if you
give me just one,

just one more chance, I'll
never do you wrong again.

What about Lucy Loose Lips?

What about Lucy?
Joker' the one that wanted her.

I was just trying to stop
him before you got there.

I never wanted to touch Lucy.

I wanted - I wanted to touch
you.

I, I'm sorry. I just.

Beetle, stop.

You had me at you're
a bunch of sluts.

And they let you stay?

Yep. I ended up watching
porn with them for 3 hours, dude.

It was hot.

That's crazy.

Hey, man, you
didn't mean what you were

saying about those Mafiosos,
did you?

Hell yeah, I did.

Dude, we can try
to talk to the coach.

I mean, maybe he'll
give you another chance or

something.

Camp started today.

And I'm not there.

I'm off the team, I got nothing.

What are you talking about?

I ain't getting outta the hood.

Baseball was my only shot.

You can still
fix this, Sharky...

what can we do?

We got to think about something.

Well, Beetle, what
do you know about my shit?

You get good grades.

You can go to any
college you want.

You have no

idea what I have
to go through, man.

You don't even know this but.

I'm not even a citizen.

What?

Bullshit, man.

You're an illegal?

Yeah, right.

I've known you
since the first grade.

Mom brought
me here when I was 2.

Damn.

You're a pinche mojado
and nobody ever knew it.

Yeah, I can't let
that stop me, though.

I don't got
time for that right now.

You better get out of here.

Are they coming to jump you in?

Yo, get outta here, Beetle.

Yo, Beetle, get outta here, man.

So, today's
the day, little Sharky.

You're gonna be made a Mafioso.

Let's get ready to do this.

On three.

Hold up, let me tie my shoe.

No, it's too
late to turn back now.

One. Two.

Hey! Let go of Sharky.

Hey, get out of here, Beetle.
Ain't nobody

trying to talk to you. Come on
homies, let's do this.

Oh yeah? Well, I got
somebody that wants to talk to you.

Is that right?

Who's that?

What the hell is this?

Hermano, it's time
for us to have a talk man.

Hey. Where y'all going?

Look at me, just look at me.

My walk, this
ain't no pimp walk.

I got shot in the ass by
my own homie, man.

My own homie shot me in the ass,

friendly fire.

Do you have an Abuelita?
Yeah, I know you do.

What if I went to your
grandma's house and jumped

her ass into my gang?
How would you feel?

How would you feel?

You're a natural warrior,
a natural leader of men.

And the more you realize that,

the less you'e gonna
kick and stab people.

Why you so low, brother?

You don't understand.

I like kicking and stabbing.

Come on, come on. Let
the healing begin, brother,

let the healing begin.

Let's get out of here, bro.

Oh, Mina, how I miss you.
You are my everything.

You're just like a flower.

Whassup, fool?

Cheer up, man. Your
parents will get over it.

No, man, my whole
family's pissed at me.

If I don't pay
back the gazebo fund,

they'll never gonna
let me back in the Banda.

Thought you hated
doing that shit anyway.

No, man. I actually love it, ok.
I love the music, the outfits,

the girls. And now
it's all gone.

So we got to get even with Lola.

And get your money back.

Why are you so bent
out of shape about it?

I mean, we all got burned,
but you're taking it extra hard.

Yeah, for real man, what's up?

You guys don't get it, do you?

Get what?

She didn't just
cheat us out of our money.

She cheated us
out of our manhood.

What?

She cheated me and
Joker out of our manhood.

You... shut up. You, too? No.

Yeah, I'm a virgin, too.

Shut up, no you're not.

No way. That can't be true.
What about those cheerleaders?

Lies.

That hoochie from La Puente?

Stories.

Wow. You know, you
told me that one night.

No, no, no. I never said I did.
I just never denied the stories.

Wow.

Oh, Sharky.

So all three of us are virgins?

I guess so.

But the hell if I'm gonna
let Lola get the last laugh.

You still got that
girl, Mina's number?

Yeah, I actually
memorized her number before

my dad took the matchbook.
She still wants to see me.

All right, call her up.

Ok.

Tell her to meet
us at my pad in one hour.

I just got an idea.

All right. Cool.
All right, you guys.

So we come up the alley.
Mina, you open the back door.

Wait.
Mina, what's this symbol right here?

I drew a little booty
to represent the back door.

Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

Now, these back
stairs are reserved for VIP.

But they're usually empty.

Now, they're gonna lead
all the way up to the office

that's located above the club.

And that's Lola's room.

You mean this room
with the devil lady in it?

That's funny, Mina.

So the
stairs do go up to the roof?

Yeah. And you see
where this lipstick is?

That's where the cabinet
is with the little metal box.

That's where Lola stores all her
money that she steals.

Don't worry, Mina.
We'll get your money back.

And when my family's
gazebo is finished,

you can come over and
I'll sing to you.

Guys, wait a minute.
What about all those bouncers?

Is there like a plan B in case
we can't get out that way?

Of course there is.
Trust me, Beetle. We can't lose.

Famous last words, Bro.

Yeah. Let's roll, Puto.

Mina, it's me, Joker.

Ok, the roof is that way.
Good luck, guys. Be careful.

Shhh.

There's a lot of things I
do, I think about baseball a lot.

I am going to Swing away,
swinging until my time is up.

Oh, shit, that's the Coach.

So what? Let's go.

Because the batter's up.
The batter is up.

You can make this happen.
This is totally, I'm down and

ready for you.

All right. Here it is.

Here, Joker, hold this. All
right, Beetle, get down there.

What? Why do I have to go down?

Well, you're the skinniest.

Go ahead, Beetle.

I can't hold on, Sharky.

Go, come on. You can do it.

I can't.

Sharky, catch.

Throw it higher.

You throw like a girl.

Come on, guys, this isn't funny.

Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

Robbery. Robbery. Robbery.

Let's get the hell out of here.

Oh, base hit!
Oh, yeah, round second.

Oh. Go to third.

I'm around third, oh. Slide.
I gotta slide. Go home.

Slide! Slide! What the hell?

What's up, Coach?

I'm a little busy here, fellas.

Yeah, looks like
she's doing all the work.

Yup. You're a lazy lover, Coach.

What's the principal
gonna think about this, Coach?

Hey fellas, can't we just uh.
Let's make a d -

Let's cut the crap. Is
Sharky back on the team or what?

Shark - oh, Rodriguez?

Yeah.

Yeah. Of course. No
hard feelings, right, buddy?

Yeah. See you at practice.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now
get the hell outta the room.

Make me proud, Coach.

Now, where were we?

Sorry, your time's up.

No extra innings?
Oh, oh, foul, foul ball.

We can't lose, huh?

Relax, I got an
emergency back-up plan.

Emergency what?
Not the Mafiosos man!

Now, let's be real cool, man.
Real cool. Oh.

Wait. Before you handle
these idiots, I want to know.

You actually thought that you
could steal from Lola?

Oh, we're gonna
shut you down, Lola.

Tell your goons to back off.

Did you hear that?
Kid says he's gonna shut me down.

The only thing that you're gonna
do is tell me how you got in.

Who helped you?

Screw you.

Who helped you?

We did it ourselves, Bitch.

Ok, hero boy. You tell me.
Who got you in here?

<i>LOUD RUMBLING.</i>

What was that?

Turns out, we're not
the only ones you screwed over.

Women of Lola's
run, you are free!

Girls, we're free! Let's go!

Damn, fool, you
don't even care that she used to

work at Lola's, huh?

No, I don't. It's just
like that movie, Pretty Woman.

That's crazy. What you gonna
do, you gonna pimp her out now?

Not even. I got her a job
that's gonna help her forget her past.

Where at?

She's a cone jockey
down at the Icee Freeze.

Oh, shit, it's the cop dude. I
can't get in trouble again. Oh.

Well, well, well.

If it isn't Peter Rabbit
and his bunny boys.

Looks like it's my lucky day.

Are you gonna
kill us or arrest us?

Kill ya? I want to thank you.
You guys opened my eyes.

I'm getting a divorce
and couldn't be happier.

As you guys know,
my wife is a slut.

I knew that.

Actually, I owe a
debt of gratitude to my

friend Benjamin here.

For what?

Because of this young man,

I was able to put a sting on
the most notorious brothel

that ever poisoned the
streets of our city.

Yeah, Beetle?

You really shut things
up at headquarters for me, kid.

Thanks.

Yeah, no problem, Officer.
That means we're cool, right?

Actually, I did a little
research on you, Benjamin.

And I found out you weren't
born in this country.

That you're actually
here illegaly.

So I need you to turn around
and put your hands on your-

Hey, you can't do that!

That's not cool.

You guys are rich.
Can't you take a joke? Come on.

I'm not gonna arrest ya.
However, whatever happened

to that bunny suit? I need it
back. You guys have that?

Actually, Officer, the
bunny suit was lost in action.

Oh.

Yeah.

Yeah, we're
really sorry about that.

But I can invite you
to some party punch.

My Tia's secret recipe.

Nah, I think I'm gonna
have to pass on that, guys.

Her secret's Tequila.

You talked me into it.

Viola.

All right. Thanks.
You guys be good.

All right.

What the hell?

Diana. Octavio.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Damas e Caballeros,

welcome to our first
annual Gazebo Banda Party.

Ok. Now we are
ready to Rock la casa.

Hey. You made it.

Yeah.

How are you?

What's the cop doing here?
I thought he was after you?

Felicia, there's something
I have to explain to you.

I used to think that losing
my virginity would make me a

man, but I know it's stupid.

And trying to get laid,
acting like a big shot

doesn't make you
man, it makes you a jerk.

So, what are you saying?

I'm saying that I, I don't
know if I'm ready to be a man.

But I really want to
be your boyfriend.

Wow. That actually sounded
pretty mature, Beetle.

But a deal is not a deal unless
it's sealed with a kiss.
