[machine beeping]

[door squeaking]

[machine beeping]

[serious music]

are you doin' in here?

Oh it's you again.

I thought I told you
never to come back here.

[machine beeping rapidly]

[speaking foreign language]

[continuous beeping]

[quiet music]

â™ª Love writes a letter â™ª

â™ª And sends it to hate â™ª


it means that I am dead.

Sorry about that.

The events the past few days

have been an adventure
to say the least.

â™ª The weather was fine
and the ocean was great â™ª

â™ª And I can't wait
to see you again â™ª

that nothing has changed,

my mind hasn't changed.

I will never be normal.

You need normal.

I know in my heart that this
world is too big for me.

â™ª No one here cares â™ª


While I walk amongst the living

I have never truly felt alive.

I won't get all cliche and
ask for your forgiveness

or even your understanding.

I only ask that you
accept why I have to go.

â™ª I Barely even noticed
that you were away â™ª

â™ª I'll see you or
I won't, whatever â™ª

world and you in better shape.

â™ª Hate keeps his head up and
walks through the street â™ª

you haven't had it easy.

â™ª Every stranger and
drifter he greets â™ª

â™ª And shakes hands with
every loner he meets â™ª

â™ª With a serious
look on his face â™ª


[phone ringing]

suck at "Goodbyes,"

I'll just say,

â™ª Gone for so long â™ª


â™ª I'm yours and that's it â™ª

[Woman On Answering
Machine] Hi this Cheryl Coons

with Attorney Abe
Berkman's office.

I'm trying to reach Casey
Dombrosky. [giggles awkwardly]

I'm calling about
an urgent matter

[Casey gasping]
regarding a probate issue

Mr. Berkman would like
to speak to you about.

If you could give me a call back

I sure would appreciate it.

You can reach me at
216-555-2192, okay?

[metallic cracking]


Have a nice day.


[typewriter clacking]
[quiet music]

Mr. Berkman will
be with you shortly.

Thanks.
[quiet music]

You Dombrosky?

Yeah.
[typewriter clacking]

Cheryl, would you get
me the Huffnagle file?

And for Christ's sake
get this kid some water.

He looks like
shit, come on back.

Come on! [sighs]

Thanks Cheryl.
[tray clattering]

Not bad huh?

I'm sorry?
Cheryl.

Not bad lookin'.

I guess not.

Would you believe she
posed for Playboy in the 70s?

79 I think, maybe 78.

Anyway she was a
looker in her day.

Well I'm sure she was.

So, I bet you're wondering

what all this is about?

I'm a little curious.

Does the name Edna Huffnagle
mean anything to you?

I think my mom
had an Aunt Edna.

My grandmother's sister I think.

That's the one.

Unfortunately Casey, Ms.
Huffnagle passed away last month.

Wow, that's too bad.

I didn't really know her.

I mean, I don't think I saw
her after I was five or six.

Well I'm not sure
if you know it not,

but Ms. Huffnagle never married

and never had any
children of her own.

In addition to that she had
amassed a considerable estate,

specifically from the royalties

of a patent she held
and licensed out.

Oh, good for her.

Ever hear of the
Pocket Blaster?

No, what, is it a
tool or something?

In a sense, it's a

how do I put this?

It's a woman's personal
massage device.

Oh?
Your Aunt Edna

invented it, quite a
remarkable little device.

Well at any rate, I was
Ms. Huffnagle's attorney

for about the last
10 years or so.

I'm also the
executor of her will.

Well what does that mean?

Well it means that
she appointed me

to see that all of her
estate is dealt with.

Specifically I'm
responsible for the division

of all of her assets according

to her very explicit
instructions.

Okay, and sorry,

what does that
have to do with me?

Aside from a few
charitable organizations

you are Ms. Huffnagle's
sole beneficiary.

You mean she left
me all her money?

Bingo!
[clock ticking]

Why would she do that?

Casey did you know anything
about your Aunt Edna?

No, like I said I
didn't really know her.

I mean, after she disappeared

I just assumed she was dead

and nobody ever talked
about her after that.

Casey, the reason your
aunt never officially married

and never had any children

was because she was a lesbian.

Oh, wow.
[clock ticking]

I didn't know.
Well that's probably

because in those days

it was much less
accepted than is today.

And when she finally
decided to come out

her family, your family,

essentially disowned her.

And she lived the rest
of her life ostracized.

Wow, I didn't
know any of that.

Nobody ever said anything.

That's really shitty.

I suspect your aunt
knew you'd feel that way

and perhaps that's why she
named you as beneficiary.

Let me read to you the
pertinent part of Edna's will.

Let's see, I got it, all right.

"Casey, you were always a
well behaved and polite boy.

"And although I have not
seen you for many years,

"it was obvious to me,
even at an early age,

"that you would
share in my struggle

"as you progressed through life.

"Please know that no one
should ever make you feel

"like less of a person
because of who you are

"or whom you choose to love.

"It is for this reason
I bequeath the sum

"of $248,000 to my
great-nephew, Casey Dombrosky,

"if he survives me.

"It is my hope that this money

"will make it possible for him

"to announce to the world
who he is and to be proud."

Um I'm sorry, I'm confused.

Your great-aunt left you a
quarter of a million dollars,

minus taxes, and
fees, and what not.

Why?
Your aunt

wanted you to have that money

because you shared
in her struggle.

That's where I'm
confused, what struggle?

Well I suppose
your aunt recognized,

even at an early age,

that you were also homosexual.

What?
[clock ticking]

I'm not gay.
It's okay Casey.

I'm not here to judge you.

Your Aunt Edna just wants you

to be proud of who you are.

Hopefully this money
will make that easier.

No, no, that's
all well and good,

but I'm not gay.

Really?
No.

Not even a little?

Sorry.
Oh boy.

That could be a problem.

Why?
Well, Ms. Huffnagle

added this codicil to her will

specifically because she
thought you were a homosexual.

So if I'm straight

I don't get the money?
Precisely.

Well then I
don't get the money

'cause I'm not gay.

Now hold on.

Let me think about this a sec.

[finger tapping]

If you can make an
oath to me right now

that you are in fact gay,

I can say that the
condition was met.

I don't know Mr. Berkman

that doesn't sound kosher.

Okay, I got it.

Would you be willing to blow me?

No I'm not,

you're not?
[Abe laughing]

I'm just messing with you.

You don't need to say anything

or even be gay, just
get with Cheryl,

sign a few documents,

and she'll cut you a check.

You should have seen
the look on your face.

[Abe laughing]

[alarm ringing]

[serious music]

[children laughing]

[gun shot]

on, you gotta get up.

[cartridge clinking]


[door squeaking]



[clock ticking]

Jules are you ready
to start talking now?

Your mother tells me
you're not sleeping.

Is that true?

I sleep.
Oh?

Because your mother,
I sleep!

Okay, fair enough.

Are you still having
the nightmares?

No.
Is that true?

No.
When was the last one?

I don't know.

A couple nights ago maybe.


Sometimes it varies.

Which part?

Sometimes I wake up
before he shoots me

and sometimes I won't.

Do you ever see his face?

No, not really.

you know why that is?

Enlighten me.

I'd like to know
what you think.

Aren't you being
paid to fix me?

I don't think you're broken.

No, you don't think

I'm in a persistent
negative emotional state

with significant impairments

in both social and
academic functioning?

Hmm?
[clock ticking]

Where did you hear that?


Jules, sometimes
adults use fancy words

to say that they think that
you're a very sensitive girl.

Sensitive?
Yes.

I think that you're
trying to make sense

of all these tragedies
on a subconscious level.

I'm 11, I don't have
a subconscious level.

Sure you do, everyone does.

And you're a very normal girl.

Well now I know
you're full of it.

[motorcycles rumbling]

[quiet music]

â™ª Waiting so long
to get with you â™ª

I can take this
whenever, no rush.

Oh thanks.

Sad about Mrs. Abergast.

Excuse me?
Mrs. Abergast, in 409?

She died last night.

I'm sorry I don't,

Shit, I'm sorry we live
in the same building.

Oh, of course, sorry.

Right, Mrs....
Abergast.

Wow you've really don't
remember me do you?

We've talked a few
times in the elevator.

You unclogged by toilet once.

I'm sorry, my
mind's somewhere else.

She had sex with Milton Berle.

Who did?
Mrs. Abergast.

She was an actress in
Hollywood in the 50s.

Well who really knows
if it was true or not.

She did have dementia.

But I like to think it was true.

I didn't know that.

Apparently he
had a huge penis,

like legendary.

Jess, can you
come into my office?

In a minute!
Not in a minute, now!

Like I said, no rush.

You know what?
Jesus!

I don't appreciate your
fuckin' attitude all right.

Yeah, I was with
Get in

the fuckin' back, now!
A customer!

All right?
Yeah, whatever, Jesus.

â™ª I'll be only
what I'll ever be â™ª

[cricket chirping]
[siren wailing]


[door slamming]

Everything okay?
What?

Yeah, everything is
just hunky-dorry.

[Casey scoffs]
Did I say something funny?

No sorry.
Seriously.

What do you find so funny?

Is it my shit for brains boss

who won't let me have
my kid's birthday off?

Or maybe it's that
I'm two seconds away

from having my gas
shut off, again.

Or maybe it's the general
fucked up-ed-ness of my life?

No, it was, you
said hunky-dorry.

My dad used to say that.

Yeah, that's hilarious.

It's actually the
last thing he said to me

before he died.

Oh, now I feel
like a horses ass.

I'm Casey.

So formal.
Yeah sorry.

People just call me Jess.

Hey.

You work at my
daughter's school.

I've seen you.

Yeah?
You really need

to pay more attention
to your surroundings.

That's a good tip.

So what are you a
teacher or something?

No, not exactly.

I'm a Lunch Lady.

No seriously, what do you do?

That's it, I'm a Lunch Lady.

Oh, well that's cool.

No it's really not.

Whatever man,
look where I work.

Whatever pays the rent.

So what is that anyway?

I saw you starring at it inside.

What is it, your
paycheck or something?

Not exactly.

It must be important.

You barely took your eyes
off it the whole night.

My aunt just died and
this is what she left me.

What like an
inheritance or something?

Exactly like an inheritance.

Lucky you. [laughs]

I mean not that your aunt died.

I mean I'm sorry that
was really shitty.


I barely knew her.

Nice, I haven't had
two 20s to rub together

in forever and
you get free money

from a stranger.

I'm sorry, man [sighs]

I'm just a ray a
sunshine tonight.

That's cool.

So why did she
leave it to you?

If you didn't know her?

She said we were
kindred spirits.

What the fuck does that mean?

I don't know.

So is it a lot?

Here.
[paper crinkling]

Holy fucking
shit, is this real?

I hope so.

This is a lot of money!

Yeah.
What are you

going to do with it?

I don't know.

I can't think of anything.

I can think of
a million things

off the top of my head.

Hey Blondie, I don't
pay you to smoke.

Barely pay me at all.

The shitter's clogged.

So unclog it!
Now!

It's not my fucking job.

Get Sean to do it.

You know you're job

is to do whatever I
tell you to, got it?

Now get your boney ass inside
and unclog that commode

or you can take the day off

and go to your
kid's birthday party

and then the next
day, and the next day,

and every day after that.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Would you show the
lady a little respect?

You're using that term
"lady" a little loosely

don't ya think?

There you go again.

That's not nice.

You know what, why don't you
stay out of this all right?

It ain't got nothing
to do with you.

I think it does.

How'd you feel if I said
something about your mother?

What's that about my mother?

It's cool, I'm coming.

You better tell your boyfriend

to watch his mouth.

He's not my boyfriend.

He's just a customer.

may look doable,

but she ain't worth the trouble.

Well you've got a big mouth.

Oh yeah, you gonna
shut it for me, huh?

Maybe.
Trust me

this bitch ain't worth it.

Hey man, fuck you!

Be cool!
No, no, no, no.

She doesn't need this
fucking job Randy!

Oh is that right?
Yeah I do.

No she doesn't, that is right.

So apologize to the lady

or stick it up your ass!

You know what, fuck you pal.

[Randy thudding to ground]

Shit, what did you do?

I don't know.

It was an accident.

Ugh, fuck!

I'm so sorry man.

Ugh, you know what?

You want her, you can have her.

You're fired!
What?

You can pick up your
last paycheck on Friday.

Ya happy, shit! [groaning]

Okay, what the
hell just happened?

I don't know.

Did you just get me fired?

I think so.

Asshole, I need
this fucking job!

Not matter how much a
douchebag my boss is!

I don't have the
grandmas leaving me

a bajillion dollars.

It was my aunt actually.

What?
It was

my Great-aunt Edna.

I don't give a
flip who she was.

She didn't leave me a dime!

Fuck, I gotta go.

Good luck with your
new found fortune.

Hey Jess?
What now man?

You wanna call social services

and take my kid away too?

Can I get a ride?

Seriously, you
just got me fired!

You know that right?

And you have the balls to
ask me for a ride home?

Well see the last bus
came by a minute ago

and so I'm kinda stuck.

Get in.

[elevator bell rings]

Oh, this is my floor.

I'm really, really sorry.

I feel terrible.

Whatever man,
it was just a job.

Okay, well good night.

[Jess sighs]

You live on this floor?

No shit Sherlock!

[door slams]

I'm gonna make it up to you.


[door squeaks]
[serious music]

Somebody in here?

If someone's in here

I'm gonna bash your head in!


Arg!

Who the fuck are you?

Ryder.
What are

you doing here?

with my trucks?

How did you get in here?

[toilet flushing]

Hey, watch your
fucking language

around your nephew.

Missy what the hell?

I almost bashed
this kid's head off!

Well that's no
way to treat family.

How the hell did
you get in here?

Mom gave me your spare key.

Great, now I've got
the change the locks.

Not that I can afford it.

That's not what I hear.

What is that supposed to mean?

Cut the shit Casey.

I know about the money.

Oh, I was wondering how long

it would take till you
came slithering in.

What's wrong, husband
number three's

not paying your rent anymore?

No, he left Ryder and
me a few months ago.

But that's not the point.

Oh there's a point?

Come on Casey, we're family.

You don't turn your
back on family.

Oh we're family now?

Okay where was
family what dad died

and mom went off her meds

and didn't feed
me for four days?

Oh that's right,
you split, right?

Family my ass!

That's not fair Casey.

You're not the only
one who had to put up

with mom's shit!

How much do you need?

Half!
Half?

Yeah, my share.

Your share?

The fucking balls on you!

Everything about you it's just,

it's just ugly.

You're right I'm
sorry, forgive me.

I know I've been
a shitty sister.

And right now, I could
really use your help.

So what do ya say?

Can you help your big sis out?

I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

I will think about it.

How much do ya need
just to get by?

Half.
Get out.

What?
I cant' believe

for a second I
fucking fell for that.

I lost my mind.

For a second I actually thought

you might have a sincere
bone in your body.

Okay, I could give you money

but that's just like
pissing it away.

Because you'll either
snort it or smoke it,

whatever the fuck
you're into now.

Screw you and your high
and mighty moral authority!

This is just like you Casey.

You think you're so perfect!

God's gift to the fucking world!

Well if you're so
god damn special

why did you drop
out of college, huh?

Because I had to take care

of our train wreck of a mother

while you banged your way
though the whitepages,

you're welcome by the way.

Yeah, well if you're
such an amazing son,

did you even know
that your mother

is missing again?

Missing, what do you mean?

Missing, like all
the other times!

Shit, how long?

What am I, her parole officer?

She'll turn up, all right?

She always does.

Whatever, you can't keep
me from that money Casey.

It's just as much
mine as it yours.

Get out, and take your
shitty kid with you.

Fine, but you know what?

I'm gonna call my own lawyer

and I'll get my share!

And you know what else?

I hope you choke on
all the lobster dinners

you buy with my money asshole!

Suck dick and die!

Classy as always.

[door slams]

What the fuck?


Sorry you had to
hear all that kid.

It's okay, she
yells at everybody.

Sorry I called you shitty.

You seem pretty cool.

Hey, don't
fuckin' talk to son.

Let's go Ryder!

Let's go!


[door slams]

[Casey sighs]

[quiet music]

Like I was sayin'
darling your job is kinda...

Whoa, whoa, I don't
want any trouble man.

No, no trouble,
I just wanna talk.

We ain't got
nothin' to talk about.

Yeah we do, Jess.

I want you to give her

her job back.

See I knew you
were boning her.

I'm not boning her.

Okay, I just feel shitty

about gettin' her fired.

If you wanna get
pissed at someone

be pissed at me, but not Jess.

She's got a kid to feed.

Well she should have
thought about that

before she went and sicced
her crazy boyfriend on me.

What is your malfunction?

I'm not her boyfriend.

Okay, I'm just
sayin' guy to guy,

do the right thing.

You really got it
for her don't ya?

I don't know.

What if I do?

Ah, see I knew it, still no.

Why not?

Look man, I just hired
a new girl all right?

And a fine lookin' one at that.

Look, I'll make
it worth your while.

Dude I don't fuckin'
swing that way bro!

No, I mean...

Why the fuck does
everyone think I'm gay?

I'm talking about money.

I'll give you money.

Oh yeah, how much we talkin'?

Name your price.

Well it's gonna cost you.

I mean after all the
shit she put me through?

Okay.
I have damages you know,

emotionally and
punitively and what not.

How much?

Five.
Five, come one

that's a little steep.

I'll give you two.

You asked me my price.

That's my price.

Okay, five, come on

that's highway robbery.

I'll give you three.

Hey, you're supposed
to be the big shot here.

If you can't swing $500 then

I got three words
for your girlfriend.

Whoa, whoa, you said 500?

Did I stutter?

Okay, all right you
drive a hard bargain.

But all right five.

Paid in full.

See that's what
I'm talkin' about.

All right so you'll call Jess

and tell her she can come back?

Yeah, just as
soon as you leave.

Okay, thank you Randy.

I appreciate it.

Yeah, yeah, pleasure
doin' business with ya.

Sucker.

See that?

Respect.
Yeah.


[knocking on door]

Hey.
Hey.

What's up?

So sorry about
the other night.

I was kind of a bitch.

No I had it coming.

Yeah you did actually.

But Randy called, said I
could come back to work.

Oh yeah?

Well that's cool.

Cut the shit, he
told me you came by.

It was no big deal.

I don't know what
you said to him

but thanks.

He was actually really cool.

Its the least I could do.

It was kinda my
fault you got fired.

No it was 100% your fault.

What did you say to him anyway?

Nothing really.

He was a pretty reasonable guy.

Now I know you're
a fucking liar.

Anyway I owe you one.

So if there's anything
I can do for you

just let me know.

Now that you mention it?

That was fast.

There is something I
could use your help with.

Well what are you waiting for?

I don't know.

You look terrified.

I am.
Why?

what I might find inside.

[Casey sighs]

[knocks on door]
Ma?

Ma open the door it's me.


[rattles door]

Ma?

Do you see anything?


That could be her body
inside on the floor.

Body, whoa time out!

You think there might
be a dead body in there?

Your mom's dead body?

It's possible.

Okay, I'm tagging out.

I'll be in the car.

Why?
You didn't say

anything about a dead body!

To be fair I didn't say
that there wouldn't be one.

Right.
C'mon

think of it as an adventure.


[serious music]

Is that a foot?

[serious music]

That seems to
be the situation.

Oh man, oh man.

Oh thank god.

Wait is your mom an amputee?

No. [sighs]

Then why does she
have a prosthetic leg?

I don't know.


What is that?

Wait you don't know
what's in there.

Well only one way to find out.


[dog barking]
Sammie!

Hey buddy!

[kibble rattling]

it must be starving.

What kind of person leaves a dog

locked up with no food or water?

The kind of person
that doesn't remember

she has a dog.

What do you mean?

My mom is a little special.

Special how?

She has trouble coping
with life sometimes.

Don't we all?

Not like Dorthy.

Well what makes
her so special,

besides her
impressive collection

of celebrity gossip rags?

My mother's psychotic.

join the club.

My mom can be a real bitch too.

My mom's tried to kill me.

I'm sure,
11 times.

What?

She suffers from
paranoid schizophrenia

and bipolar disorder.

multiple personalities?

No, she sees and
hears things sometimes.

Like ghosts?

No, like she thinks
things are happening

or going to happen to her.

This one time when I was 13,

there was this commercial

with the starving kids?

You know the one
for 50 cents a day,

you too can feed the children?

Anyway she thought the
guy in the commercial

was talking directly to her.

And he was telling her that
is wasn't fair for her,

or us, to eat when there were
children dying of hunger.

So one time we
didn't eat for days.

Shit.
Yeah.

Then one day I came
home from school

and the pantry, which had been
completely empty for days,

was suddenly stocked
with more food

than we've ever had in there.

I thought, "Great, she'd
come to her senses."

So I start makin' myself a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich

and she comes into
the kitchen screaming

about how the food
is for the children.

And I'm like, "I
am your children."

[scary music]

And she grabs a butcher knife,

[scary music]

and she stabs me
right in the forearm.

That's messed up.

Just another day in paradise.

So what happened
with your mom?

She just snapped out of it?

The neighbors
heard all the yelling

and called the cops.

They issued a 5150.

It's a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

They took her to the nut house

and pumped her full of lithium

so she was mom again.

At least for a little while.

And that was the first time

something like that happened?


That was the fifth
time she was committed.

But is was the first time

I ever saw someone tase my mom.


you come at the cops

with a bloody butcher knife.

I guess I'm lucky they
just didn't shoot her.

[child's distorted laughter]

So what now, should we
call the cops or something?

No, she'll turn up.

She always does.

[cassette tape clacking]

[quiet music]

How come I don't see any
pictures of you in here?

Shit I just realized I don't
even know your last name.

Dombrosky.
Dombrosky.


Is this your prom photo?

You must have been
the bell of the ball.

Really so beautiful.
All right give me that.

No, no, no.

All right look you philistine

I was in the
Shakespeare theater club

and we were traditionalists

so we did it like he
did back in his days.

So all the parts by women

were played by men.

Nerd alert!

Oh my god, did you
have to make out

with this guy on stage?

You did didn't you?

No, there was no
making out, homophobe.

It was "Twelfth Night."

I was Viola and that's my
twin brother Sebastian.

And just so you know Viola
spends most of the time

in disguise as a man.

So really was just
playing a man.

What are you doing?

Just looking up "Twelfth
Night," on Wikipedia.

Why?
Just checking something.

What?

Ha, I knew it.

"The play ends in a
declaration of marriage

"between Duke Orsino and Viola."

You totally made out
with a dude on stage.

It was a quick kiss.

I'll have you know
the school paper

gave us a glowing review.

Glowing, it was
four stars in fact.

Yeah?
Yeah.

And how much of that
for you frenching a dude?

Bet it was hot.

Wouldn't you like to know.
Maybe.

What's the matter?

I just realized
you're the first girl

I've ever had in here.

Get out, I'm the first girl

you've had in your room?

Yeah.

Liar.

Guess I never wanted to bring
a girl around this madness.

My mom anyway.

Man she really
fucked you up huh?

I guess so.

Is that why you
tried to kill yourself?

What?

You have...

I don't,
It's okay.

This is a judgment free zone.

So why'd yo do it?

I don't know.

You don't why you
tried to kill yourself?

It's complicated.

Are you depressed?

Not exactly.

A girl, it's always a girl.

It wasn't a girl.
A guy?

No, nothing like that.

Well why?

You're nosy.

Yeah, so?

I'm not happy.

And?

And that's it.

You're not happy?

Not really no.

Well who the fuck is,
George Clooney maybe?

That's no reason to
cash in your chips.

more than that.

I don't even know you, why
am I telling you all this?

Spit it out.


Stalling.

I'm incapable of
experiencing joy.

Those things that
make people happy,

sex, money, drugs, career,

I feel nothing.

And after a lifetime
of feeling vacant

and numb I just,

I just couldn't do it anymore.

Add that to the fact that I get

a front-row seat at my
own future psychosis

every time I see my mother,

I just can't.

I didn't think anyone
would miss me so.

I would have missed you.

didn't know me three days ago.

Still, I know I would have.

Thanks I guess.

You probably think
I'm a head case.

No I don't.

Look I get it, I do.

Life is hard and

things are never what you
think they're going to be.

I'd be lying if I said I
hadn't thought about it myself.

What stopped you?

My daughter, Jules.

She needs me.

She's really messed
up right now.

Messed up how?

She's just more sensitive
than other kids her age.

She fixates on things.

She's a worrier.

But it pisses me off
that she has to grow up

in this Fox News,
24-hour news cycle,

scare the shit out of everyone

on an hourly basis world.

Sorry am I rambling?

No, I asked.

[jaunty carousel music]

was a little girl

my dad would take me to
this park in our town

and there was this carousel,

you know with brightly
painted horses,

and organ music.

And you could ride
it for 25 cents.

So no matter how little
money your folks made

they could always
afford to take you

to ride the merry-go-round.

[serious music]

Sounds idyllic.

It was, it was a big, big part

of my childhood.

And then they tore it down.

Why?
The economy

went into the shitter.

It was a two-factory town

and after the last one shut down

everything went to hell.

The town's money dried up.

They closed the
park and hauled off

that carousel piece by piece.

And it was like they were
hauling away my childhood.

Like the world lost
all of its innocence.

Now I really
wanna kill myself.

Shut up. [giggles]

Shit what time is it?

It's almost three.

I gotta go.

I told Randy I would
pick up a shift.

We can go.

Fuck, I'm not gonna have time

to pick up Jules and then
get to the diner on time!

I can pick her up if you want.

I couldn't.

It's no biggie.

Are you sure, she's
kind of a handful.

How bad can she be?

Jules?
Yeah?

Who are you?

I'm Casey, I live
in your building.

I'm a friend of you mom's.

Okay, well where is my mom?

She's at work.

Yah-huh.
No, she got fired

yesterday.
No, she had to work today.

Are you going to get in?

Did you kill my mother?

Why the fuck would
you ask me that?

'Cause you're driving her car.

I don't know what to tell you

other than the fact I
didn't kill your mom.

Frankly I'm a little
hurt you even asked.

You gonna get in or not?

Raise your right hand then.

Why?
Would you just do it?

Do you solemnly swear that
you won't sodomize me?

Where'd you even
learn that word, Jesus!

"Law and Order."

I swear I won't
sodomize you, Christ!

Okay.

Wait, is she in the trunk?

Is who in the trunk?

My mother.

No, don't be ridiculous.

Prove it.

How?
Open the trunk.

Seriously?
Completely.

You darklin' kid.

[Jules sighs]
There, happy?

Yeah.

I trust you.

[car engine revs]

[meat sizzling]
[upbeat music]

Welcome to Happy Burger,

the happiest place on earth.

Can I take your order?

This is the happiest
place on earth?

Can I just take
your order dude?

Fine, can I have
the number one

with extra pickles
and a large coke?

And whatever she wants.

Hey they've got a kiddie meal,

you want that?

Hey, hey, space cadet.

What do you want to eat?

Someone in this
room has a gun.

What, where, did you
see someone with a gun?

No.
Then why

do you think they have a gun?

Because it's a numbers game.

Statistically speaking

one in 38 people in this state

have a conceal and carry permit.

There are 38 people
in this room,

so somebody's gotta be packing.

I'm sorry her imagination's
a little crazy sometimes.

I'm not crazy.

Facts are facts, since
1983 there have been

78 mass shootings
claiming the lives

of 547 people and injuring 476.

Should I be worried?

No, no, everything's fine.

Look, everything is fine, okay.

Nobody goes into a restaurant

and just shoots people
for no good reason, okay?

Look the kids' meal has an
inappropriately dressed doll.

Okay that's not true.

Take the 1984 massacre

in a San Diego McDonald's
by James Huberty.

He shot and killed 21 people

including five children
before being fatally shot

by a S.W.A.T. team sniper.

What's your point?

One minute those people

were enjoying their Big Macs

and the next ka-blamo, dead!

All of them were dead.

Just give her a kids meal.

Extra pickles for me.

[cash register beeping]

Can you switch me seats?

Why?


You've got to give me
a better reason than that

if you want me to
switch after the stunt

you just pulled.

Please?
Nope.


Give me a good reason.

I can't, you'll
think I'm crazy.

I got news for you kid

I all ready think you're nuts.

Fine.

Eat your food.

[Casey scoffs]

Fine see if I care.

I'll tell my mom you
made me starve to death.

I'll tell your mom that
you're a mental patient

and almost made that
poor girl at the counter

piss her pants.

I'm not a mental patient.

Studies show that the
number of homicides

at fast food restaurants

is more than double
that of sit-down places.

Is that a fact?
Yes.

Why do you think
that is smarty pants?

Fast food restaurants
are easy targets

for robbery because they
carry a lot of cash on hand.

Plus they're usually
near major highways

making for an easy getaway.

Where do you get this stuff?

The internet.

Okay why don't
you talk to your mom

about monitoring your
internet activity?

Shouldn't you be worrying
like which Kardashians

dating which NBA player
or something like that?

Ew, fuck that!

Hey, hey, language, Jesus.

care about that stuff.

Well you should.

At your age you
shouldn't be thinkin'

of messed up things like that.

What else is there
to think about?

I don't know, unicorns
and rainbows and shit.

I'm not four.

Yeah but you're not 40, okay?

So you shouldn't be
thinkin' about that stuff.

Trust me, you've got enough time

to worry about death
when you're older.

By the way, that Huberty
guy in San Diego?

It wasn't a robbery.

He suffered from mental illness.

How did you know that?

'Cause I was six
when it happened.

Scared the shit out of me too.

Really?
Yeah.

Didn't go to McDonald's
for a long time after that.

So then what did you do?

Nothing, I just
kept on being a kid

and eventually I got over it.

And it's what you should do.

Just be a kid and stop fixating

on all that dark stuff.

But what if I can't?

Well, it's off the
nut house with you.

want a Super Colossal Burger!

Good enough.
Spencer Alexander Lanning

you watch your mouth.

Now you march over to that table

and you eat what's
on your tray, now.

No!
[tray clattering]

What's happening?


[Jules screams]


It's okay, you're okay.

[Jules screams]
Hey!

Everything's okay, all right?

You're fine.

Come on, it's okay.

You're okay, everything is fine.

[Jules sobs]

All right, Jesus Christ.

You scared the shit out of me.

I'm sorry.
It's all right.

Let's get you home, come on.

It's okay, nothing to see here.

We're fine, it's
all good, thank you.

Holy shit.


it cost them the arms race

destroyed all hope of victory.

Germany's cities are in,

she been like this?

A couple years.

Ever since Sandy Hook she's
been preparing herself.

For what?

The inevitable, or at least
what she thinks that is.

Like everyone else she
watched it unfold on TV

and ever since
she's been convinced

it's only a matter of time
before it happens to her.

She's had it under
control lately,

relatively speaking.

Yeah you didn't see
her in the restaurant.

I almost had a heart attack.

Oh I've seen it.

The doctor says she has symptoms

like post traumatic
stress disorder.

Like the guys coming
back from combat?

Pretty much, it
started with nightmares

and then she couldn't
leave the house for a week.

And her obsession with
guns and legislation.

Can you imagine an 11 year-old

who should be having slumber
parties with her friends

spends her free time
looking at websites

about mass murder and gun laws.

Does she still go to therapy?

I took her to
a couple sessions

but I don't have
health insurance

working at the diner.

So we just can't afford it.

[phone ringing]

Oh excuse me.

Missy, now I have
the change my locks

and my phone number.

Wait, wait, wait,

wait, slow down.

What?
[chatter on the phone]

Shit!
What?

They found my mom.

[machines beeping]
[indistinct chatter]

Missy where is she?

Hello to you too.

Come on, I really
don't have time

for your shit right now.

Just tell me exactly
what happened.

I don't know.

They won't let me see her.

They have her in
a room somewhere.


What am I speaking Spanish?

They won't let me see her.

So no I haven't spoken to her.

Fuck!
We'll hang back

just do what you gotta do.

Thanks, excuse me.

I need to see my mom
Dorthy Dombrosky.

Are you the son?
Yeah.

You have my mom in here,
locked away somewhere?

Yeah, well we had to.

The bitch is crazy.

Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

Missy I'll handle this.

Better watch it lady.
Missy!

For the love of god will
you shut the fuck up

and go sit down, please?

Just do what you do best

and sit this one out.
Fine.

But I'll be right over there.
Great!

Look I'm sorry.

Obviously the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

Tell me exactly what she did.

Hi Mr. Dombrosky,
I'm Rachel Calahan

with adult protective services.

And I was on call
when the incident

happened.
Okay.

What incident, please
will you just stop

with the ambiguity

and tell me exactly
what happened?

Your crazy ass mother
sucker punched me.

Thank you Rita.

I believe I can
handle it from here.

Okay, [speaking
foreign language]

I don't know
what she's saying.

Mr. Dombrosky I understand

your concern about your mother.

And she's okay.

I just need you to know

this situation is very serious.

We had to sedate her.

Okay?

You don't seem very surprised.

It's par for the course.

[machine beeping]
[serious music]

Espinoza found your mom

in the room of oncology patient

by the name of Jeff Timlin.

Do you know who that is?

No.
Could he be

and acquaintance of your mom's?

I don't think so.

I don't know.

Well what does that have
to do with anything?


Ms. Espinoza
confronted your mother

in Mr. Timlin's room
while she was attempting

to administer a lethal
dose of morphine

into the patient's IV.
[machine beeping]

Shit.
She's very disoriented.

She was rambling about
someone named Jerry?

My father's name was Jerry.

Where is he?

He passed away.
I'm sorry.

It's fine, it's
a long time ago.

Mr. Dombrosky does your mother

have a history of
mental illness?

Does she?

Yeah, she's the poster child

for fucking mental illness.

What was her diagnosis?

She bipolar.
Is she under

a doctor's care?

She was obviously,

but now, look I don't know.

We've drifted apart.

Will you just tell
me what happens next?

Can I take her home?

I'm afraid that
will not be possible.

Why not?

Mr. Dombrosky your mother
tried to kill a patient

in this hospital.

And she assaulted
a staff member.

She's harmless.

All right, she's bat shit crazy

but she's harmless.

Be that as it may

you just need to know this
is a serious situation.

There's a chance that
she may be charged

and you might want
to get a lawyer.

is very serious.

If convicted your mother
could go away for long time.

Convicted?

I told you she didn't
try to kill anyone.

That's not the way
it looks on our end.

Now look there's still
a lot of moving parts.

But once I turn this report
over to the prosecutor

it's very likely your
mother would be charged

with attempted murder.

You're going to
send her to prison?

Not necessarily.

Your mom appears to have a case

for what's known as
diminished mental capacity.

And basically what that is

is she lacks the ability

to differentiate
between right and wrong.

Okay.
So if the court

finds that she lacks
criminal responsibility

then she could possibly
be civilly committed

instead of going to prison.

A hospital?
A state psychiatric

facility.
Fine.

However it could take awhile

to process everything and
your mom would not be getting

the treatment that
needs in the interim.

My department gets involved

when someone with
diminished mental capacity

becomes a threat to themselves

or to those around them

and I believe in this case

your mom falls
into that category.


What I think is we may be able

to have your mom
involuntarily committed now

instead of going through
the criminal process.

Meaning?
I think

that your mom requires
residential treatment

for an extended period of time

because there is a
substantial likelihood

that she's gonna hurt herself

or someone else if she's
not committed immediately.

Okay, but how does that
keep her out of jail?

If the judge commits her prior

to my report being submitted

the prosecution will wait

to charge her until
they determine

what the diagnosis and
treatment plan are.

If that's going to
keep her outta jail

then let's do it.

it's not the simple.

Of course it isn't.

Your mom receives
SSI disability

and there are costs associated

with having someone
civilly committed,

substantial costs.

Okay?

However if your mom does go
through the criminal process

and she is found lacking
criminal responsibility

then all of her treatment

and commitment would be
covered by the state.

Let me get this straight,

just so I'm clear.

If I pay a substantial
amount of money

then my mom gets the help

she needs now.

If I don't, she
rots in a jail cell

until a judge decides
she needs help?

In a nut shell.

That's fucked!

The system isn't perfect.

Can I see her?

Hey, I'm so sorry.

It's okay, how's your mom?

It's not good.

Would you excuse
me for one minute

I have one more
thing to take care of

and I swear we can go.

Do what you gotta do.
Okay.

Oh hey little bro.

Hey.
This is Antonio.

Nice to meet you.

He's a paramedic.

I see that.

Antonio is it?

Could you give me a moment

alone with my sister?

Sure, I gotta run anyway.

I have your number.

I'll call you sometime.


Hey.
What's up?

What's up?

How the fuck can you be
so casual about this?

You know they might send
mom to jail forever?

Does that even
resonate with you?

Relax, she's always
getting into little SNAFUs.

Everything's gonna be fine.

SNAFU, is that what you
call attempted murder?

Listen Missy, here's the deal,

you want half of
Aunt Edna's money?

You got it.
Really?

Yeah, but with it
comes some strings.

What kind of strings?

Great big fucking strings.

I'm listening.

You get the money,
but then I'm out.

What does that
mean, "you're out?"

It means I'm done.

I'm done, you get the money

but with it comes
the responsibility.

All of it.

You take care of
mom from now on.

I can't do it.

Okay, I have too
many of my own issues

and I just can't.

So can you do that?

Can you do the right thing
for once in your life?

I don't know Casey.

Don't give me that shit.

You want the money?

This is how you get it.

I don't know if I can.

I'm not like you.

Casey you're strong, I'm weak.

You'll figure it out.

You always do.

This is the deal.

Do we have a deal?

Yeah.

Say it.

We have a deal.

Okay, I'm going to
say goodbye to Dorthy.

[quiet music]

â™ª I'll play a simple chord â™ª

â™ª What she climbed
was a big night â™ª

â™ª And hang around
the moon and stars â™ª

â™ª Without gravity it pulls
me to powdered light â™ª

â™ª I'll steal a kiss
of left behind â™ª

â™ª But all this singing â™ª

Okay let's get out of here.

Hey.
â™ª So I emptied out â™ª

â™ª The jars and I counted out â™ª

â™ª All the possibilities â™ª

â™ª Go an see did you forget me â™ª

â™ª All I see is the
bottom of your feet â™ª

â™ª Don't walk away from me â™ª

You okay?
Yeah I'm golden.

Liar.

No really

I'm good, right
now is fucked up.

But I'm actually
pretty relieved.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I mean this way at least

I know Dorthy's not
gonna kill herself

or some poor bastard.

I know where she is.

I know she's getting
the help she needs.

Maybe Missy will
actually surprise me

and step up and do the
right thing for once.

Maybe not, but either way.

[quiet music]


What?
Stop the car!

Why?
Listen to me!

What's going on

are you sick?
Stop the car!


Stop the car!

Okay, okay, we're stopped.

What the hell has
gotten into you?

Did you not see the sign?

What sign?
The exit sign back there

didn't you see what it said?

No Jules I didn't
what did it say?

We have to go back there.

I don't understand, why?

Please?

It happened here.

What happened?

October 22nd, 2011.

Andrew Langston, aged
20, shot and killed

six people and himself

at Scared Heart
Elementary School.

That's in Marinette.

Oh shit.
First he killed his mother

and little brother before
driving to the school

with four guns, a Bushmaster
223 caliber rifle,

a Glock 10 millimeter hand gun,

a Sig Sauer nine
millimeter hand gun

and an Izhmash 12 gage shotgun.

He killed four
third grade children

and one teacher.

That's messed up.

Four others were injured

including the principal,

the guidance councilor

and nine year-old fourth
grader Emily Richmond.

According to a corner's report

all the of the victims were
shot between three and 11 times.

Where did you get
a corner's report?

The Department of
Public Records website.

They just let kids read
those online for free?

That's messed up.

Of course not, I had
to pay of it first.

With what money?

You never log out of
your PayPal account.

Why would you do that?

To learn, I don't want
to be another statistic.

This is really messed up.

Jules,
We have to go there.

I have to see her.

See who?
Emily.

The one who survived.

can't just go there.

Why not?
We don't even know

where she lives.

But I need to see her

and tell her,
Tell her what?

Jules this has got to stop.

You are fixated on this stuff.

It's not healthy.

Mom.
No that's the end of it.

Discussion over.

That's bullshit.

Watch your mouth.

Okay, I could take her.

Casey we can't.

It obviously means
a lot to her, right?

This is a bad idea.

Yeah, maybe.

[birds chirping]

I feel weird about this.

I'm sure it's fine.

We'll knock, they'll answer

and we'll ask,
"Hey by any chance

"was your daughter
shot by a maniac?"

Jules we don't have to do this

we can just drive away.

No, I want to.

She wants to, let's do it.

It's all you kid.


[doorbell ringing]

Hello?

Hi, I'm Jessica and
this my daughter Julie.

And this is my friend Casey.

Jules, say hello.

Hi.
Hello.

How can I help you?

I know this is
going to sound weird,

but my daughter has something

she'd like to ask you and
you can totally say "no."

Okay.

It was school picture day.

We fought over how she
was going to wear her hair

Emily wanted to wear
it in a pony tail.

I wanted her to wear it down.

She has such pretty hair.

But she started
playing volleyball

and all the girls

were going to wear their
hair up for pictures.

It's so stupid.

Silly things we think
are worth fighting over.

After it was over and,

[serious music]

we were at the hospital

and we had not idea of
Emily was alive or dead.

There was a lot on confusion

because a lot of the
girls had head wounds

and they couldn't
tell who was who

if it wasn't for the numbers.

The numbers?

On their uniforms.

Oh god.
I was lucky.

I was hit in the back.

And that's what
caused the paralysis?

Yeah.
A CT scan revealed

the bullet fragmented,

fracturing the first
lumbar vertebra

lodging between the
right vertebral body

and aorta, I read.

It's kind of what she does.

We were just about
to have dinner.

You're welcome to stay.

We couldn't we've
already imposed enough.

It's no trouble, really.

I could eat.

Emily why don't you
show Julie your room

while your mother gets
supper on the table?

Okay.
By the way

you can call me Jules.

Everyone calls me Jules.

you go to school?

I go to Lincoln.


Um, a couple hours from here.

You came all
that way to see me?

Yeah, well also Casey's mom,

she got arrested for murder.

Well I guess it
wasn't really murder

but like attempted murder.

I don't know I didn't
really hear all the details.

Is he your dad?

He's my mom's friend.

But I really like him.

He seems nice.

You know he is.

[crickets chirping]

[door creaking]
Hey.

Weird day huh?

That's the
understatement of the year.

Still I feel at peace.

Like today was important.

For Jules?

For everyone.

Looks like we
had the same idea.

Connie won't let me
smoke in the house.

I just wanna say thanks

for the dinner and for
letting Jules meet Emily.

You guys are way too kind.

Yeah we've inconvenienced
you enough for one lifetime.

So we'll be heading out.

Aw, nonsense, it's too
late to head out now.

You'll stay the night.

Oh no we can't, really.

It's no trouble.

Besides I think it'll
do Emily some good

to have Jules spend the night.

A lot of the kids don't
come around as much anymore.

It's good that Jules
isn't afraid of her.

Why would they
be afraid of her.

Who knows, kids are kids.

Maybe they think she's fragile.

Maybe she reminds them of
what they're tryin' to forget.

Whatever the reason,
I'm glad you came.

We're glad you came.

Well at least let me
help with the dishes.

I already loaded
up the dishwasher.

So it's settled you'll
head out in the morning.

You're strong people.

You're much stronger
than I could be.

You'd be surprised.

We're no stronger
than anyone else.

We just decided that
we aren't gonna let

that one moment define
who we were as a family.

We were gonna be
bigger than the moment.

Do you have kids?

No.

You'll see.

They make you stronger than
you ever thought you could be.

I believe that.

Hey do you think I
could ask you a question?

Sure.

That boy,

Andrew, the one that shot you,

you knew him?

Yeah, he used to mow our lawn.

Did you see him
when he shot you?

I mean did you see
him pull the trigger?

No, I was running away.

But I saw him shoot my
friend Katie in the head.

I'm just so sorry
he did this to you.

It's okay, I forgive him.

Really?

Why?

I guess if that's
the worst thing

that's happened to me,

I'm pretty lucky.

I can't imagine anything
worse happening to me.

And I survived.

And I met you.

Yeah.

Good night.

Good night.

It's funny about these photos.

Yeah, how so?

They're smiling.

They had no idea the shit storm

that was coming their way.

Bad things happen
to good people.

That's just it,

even after all that happened,

they don't seem any different.

They still smile.

They still just keep living

like nothing's changed.

Well what else can they do?

They can get angry.

What?

Nothing.

There's one bed huh?

Yeah, that seems
to be the situation.

How do you wanna do it?

Sleeping arrangements,

I can sleep on the floor or,
No it's okay.

We can share the bed.

You sure?
Yeah.

I don't bite.

Okay.

Okay, can I just say

that was pretty amazing.

What?
This.

This entire day.

Well not the stuff
with your mom.

But everything after
that, with Jules.

I think this is gonna
be really good for her.

I hope so.

I just wanna say thank you.

For what?
For doing this.

For making me do this.

I didn't make you do anything.

You're a great mom.

And I know you'd do
anything for Jules.

Well I couldn't have done
it without you, really.

Maybe you needed a push

from a crazy person?

Maybe, not that you're crazy.

But yeah.

Don't mention it.

Casey?

Hm?

I like you.

You're a pretty
cool person yourself.

No, I mean

I really like you.

Really?

Do you like, like me, like me?

Be serious.

I don't know who you are

or really much about you at all.

But yeah, I like you.

I think you might know me

better than anybody in
the world right now.

That's sad.

Why is it sad?

Because I've known
you for four days.

It was a pretty
eventful four days

don't you think?

What about your family?

Your mom, they know you?

Maybe when I was a little kid,

before my dad died, but not now.

I don't even know
if my mom knows

she has a son now.

It has to feel like
nobody knows who I am.

I don't even know
who I am anymore.

Well I feel like
I know who you are.

I mean on one hand I
don't know you at all

but in a way

I feel like I've
always known you.

You're a pretty amazing person.

Really I'm not.

In the few days I've known you

you've got me my job back,

Which I got you fired from

to begin with.

Yeah there was that.

But still you didn't
have to do what you did.

But you did it anyway.

Any guy would have done that.

No actually most
guys wouldn't have.

At least not the ones I know.

And you're here now,

sleeping in a complete
stranger's bed

because you cared about the
feelings of a little girl

you barely know.

I mean who does that?

I don't know.

Wait, what are you doing?

What does it look like?

It looks like you
had an emotional day

and you're about to do something

you're going to regret.

I'm a big girl.

I'll decide what
mistakes I make.

Yeah this seems
like a big one.

Why don't you like yourself?

What's there to like?

I can think of a few things.

Jess, you're like the
coolest chic I ever met.

You're smart and you're funny

and Jules is awesome.

And you are sexy as hell.

But...
But

but I'm a disaster right now.

Hi I'm Jessica, have we met?

I was hanging from a rope

a few days ago.

Do you get the enormity of that?

I know but you didn't die.

You're alive.
Am I?

I'm breathing but I
haven't felt alive

since I don't know when.

So now you get
a second chance.

A second chance at what?

Life, love, the
pursuit of happiness.

I don't know what
any of that means.

Just because a fucking
ceiling fan broke

doesn't meant I magically
changed my mind.

Nothing has changed.

It hasn't changed anything.

It changed everything.

How?

You met me, that's
pretty awesome.

You're rich now,
couldn't say that before.

That's the beauty of life.

One minute you're world
can be at its darkest

and then the sun rises

and you see the world
in a whole new light.

It's a shitty world.

It's the same shitty world

where I look at my mother
and I see my future.

Yeah but now it's a
world with me in it.

And you said it
yourself, I'm awesome.

Actually I said
Jules was awesome.

I said you were sexy.

Either way.

And you don't know for sure

what the future holds.

Yeah you could end
up like your mom

or maybe you won't.

But I think I wanna be
there to find out with you.

And if that means
being your friend

or your girlfriend, or whatever.

You don't have to go
through any of it alone.

Why would you want to
be a part of any of that?

Because something really
amazing is happening

right in front of our faces

and I don't know
exactly what it is

but I wanna find out.

And yeah, life sucks sometimes.

And your mother is a mental case

and your sister is
catastrophe waiting to happen.

But you're not.

You are not a fucking disaster.

Even if you are,

let's be one big,
fucking tornado together.

You're nuts.
Yeah.

Well fuck it.

[serious music]
[lips smacking]

[fingers tapping]

[Jules clears throat]

Morning.
Morning?

Hey, uh,
[Jess groans]

Morning sexy man.

Uh, Jules.
Jules!

What are you doing in here?

Did you guys have intercourse?

Jules what did I tell you

about coming into my room

when I have someone over?

To not.
You have a lot

of men over?

Define a lot.

Enough that you have
to remind your daughter

not to come in when
someone's over?

So what if I do?

I wanna go home now.

Is everything okay?

Actually, yeah.

It's just time.
[upbeat music]

Okay, well get dressed

and then say good bye to Emily.

Emily had to go to school.

Shit, school!

You have school today!

[upbeat music]

How you doin' Jellybean?

I'm okay, a
little hungry maybe.

She wasn't talking to you.

Then who was she talking to?

Me stupid, guys
aren't called Jellybean.

Jokes on you dumb
ass 'cause in college,

my nickname happened
to be Jellybean.

Not-ah.
Yeah-huh.

You're such an ignoramus.

Takes one to know one.

[both blow raspberries]

Okay who wants pancakes?

[car engine revving]


[elevator bell rings]

[upbeat music]

Hey.
Mm-hm?

Here, you go on in

and I'll be right there.

Okay, later Jellybean.

are you goin' so fast?

Oh I was just gonna lie
down for about a week.

A crazy couple of days.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah I just
need to clear my head

and maybe grab a shower.

Okay, do you wanna
come over later?

I can fix us dinner.

I make a really
crappy tuna casserole.

How can I turn that down?

Okay then.
[lips smacking]

I'll see you tonight.

[quiet music]

[upbeat music]

[Casey sighs]

â™ª No more loss somehow â™ª

â™ª No more heartbreakin' â™ª

â™ª Goin' nowhere â™ª

â™ª I'm gone, I'm gone â™ª

â™ª Love in slow motion â™ª

â™ª Feelin's left over â™ª

â™ª Holding' on, we're gone â™ª

â™ª We're gone â™ª

[Casey sighs]

[knocking on door]

Hey, diner's not ready yet

but come on in.

Can I borrow your car?

Right now?
Yeah,

there's something I
need to take care of

and it's kinda important.

Yeah, sure.

Here, when will you back?

I have to work at seven.

Shit, I forgot.

You know I can do
it another time.

No, no do what you gotta do.

I can take the bus to the diner.

Are you sure?

Yeah, yeah, just pick
me up tonight after?

Rain check on dinner.
Definitely.

I'm gonna hold you to that.

[elevator bell rings]

[quiet music]

[bus engine rumbling]

â™ª All I want is nothing more â™ª

â™ª To hear you
knockin' at my door â™ª

Casey, are you in there?

â™ª Because if I could
see your face â™ª

â™ª Once more â™ª
[insistent knocking on door]

Casey!
â™ª I could die a happy man â™ª

â™ª I'm sure â™ª

â™ª When you said
your last goodbye â™ª

â™ª I died a little inside â™ª

â™ª I lay in tears
in bed all night â™ª


The events of the past few days

have been an adventure
to say the least.

I think I've learned more

about humanity in last 48 hours

than I have in
the last 30 years.

And I have to say I'm impressed.

Nevertheless, if
you're reading this

it means that I am dead.

Sorry about that.

I know in my heart
that this world

is too big for me.

It always has been.

While I walk amongst the living

I've never truly felt alive.

That is until I met you.
â™ª Find somebody â™ª

â™ª I'll find somebody â™ª

â™ª And you are all â™ª

Well let me start by saying

that I'm very sorry
for your loss.

I can't imagine how
difficult it must be

for you to have to
go through this.

It's always tragic when a
young life is cut short.

But even more so in
situations like this.

I wish we were meeting under
more pleasant circumstances

but the situation
being what it is

let's get right to it.

Can I get you water or anything?

I'm fine.
I can't say to you

that I knew Casey very well.

But from what I did know of him

he seemed to be a good, decent

and kind person.

And he obviously thought
the world of you.

So on to the sliver lining?

I'm not sure if you are aware

but in the past few weeks,

Mr. Dombrosky accumulated
some fairly lucrative assets.

Why would I be aware?

Right, well, in
addition to the money

he received from his inheritance

Casey was also the heir
to his late great-aunt's

patent royalties which earn
approximately 8,000 per month.

And after his mother was ordered
into residential treatment

he was appointed
conservator of her estate.

He gained ownership of her home.

[Jess scoffs]

What a waste.
[quiet music]

So what now, all that money
just goes to the state?

To the contrary,
it goes to you.

I'm sorry?

Ms. Magee, it was
Casey's final wish

that you and your
daughter be the designees

of those assets, the
money, the home is yours.

So he thinks,

thought

that is was okay to make
someone have feelings

for someone else
and then just leave?

So what is this, like some
sort of conciliation prize?

I know this is hard.

And I can't say that I blame
you for having feelings

of resentment, even anger.

But if any good has
come out of this

this is it,

a fresh start for you
and your daughter.

Whatever.

Well then.

I have some paperwork
that you'll need to sign.

Let me just grab those
forms from my secretary

and you can be on your
way lickety split.

Why would he do this?

Love makes people
do crazy things.

â™ª But if you loved me â™ª

â™ª Why did you leave me â™ª

know that you had nothing

to do with my decision.

I told you before that
nothing has changed.

My mind hasn't changed.

And even though you and
Jules changed my heart,

I'll never be normal.

Jess you need normal.

You need stability.

Hopefully I can provide that

or at least help you
get on the right track.

You are truly amazing.

And Jules is one in a million.

[quiet music]

â™ª Whoa-oh, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª Whoa-oh, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª

some arrangements

and gotten a little help

from an unlikely
source so that maybe,

just maybe Jules can
take back her innocence.

And in some small way,
maybe you can too.

â™ª Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª
[upbeat music]

suck at goodbyes

I'll just say,

"fuck it."

Your friend, Casey.

[upbeat music]

â™ª If you loved me â™ª

â™ª Why'd you leave me â™ª

â™ª Take my body â™ª

â™ª Take my body â™ª

â™ª All I wanted â™ª

â™ª And all I needed â™ª

â™ª To find somebody â™ª

â™ª I'll find somebody â™ª

â™ª Like you, whoa-oh, oh â™ª

[quiet music]

â™ª I'll play a simple chord â™ª

â™ª While she climbed
was a big night â™ª

â™ª I'll hang around
the moon and stars â™ª

â™ª Without gravity â™ª

â™ª It pulls me to
the powdered light â™ª

â™ª A sea of cares
I've left behind â™ª

â™ª But all you've seen â™ª

â™ª And it seems like
running towards â™ª

â™ª Promises you made to me â™ª

â™ª So I emptied out the jars â™ª

â™ª And I counted out
all the possibilities â™ª

â™ª Go and see â™ª

â™ª Did you forget me â™ª

â™ª All I see â™ª

â™ª Is the bottom of your feet â™ª

â™ª Don't walk away from me â™ª

â™ª The pounding of my feet â™ª

â™ª Sets the rhythm
to the rising sun â™ª

â™ª Your curtains all
have come undone â™ª

â™ª And as the sunbeams gleam â™ª

â™ª Heavy in your dusty room â™ª

â™ª Is showin' a part
of an empty frame â™ª

â™ª But we're always running â™ª

â™ª It seems like singin' songs â™ª

â™ª Meant to lull you to sleep â™ª

â™ª So I strum this guitar â™ª

â™ª And start hummin' 'bout
all the possibilities â™ª

â™ª All I see is you forgave me â™ª

â™ª All I see is the
bottom of your feet â™ª

â™ª Can you see â™ª

â™ª You belong to me â™ª

â™ª Please oh please â™ª

â™ª Don't give up on me â™ª

â™ª Don't give up on me â™ª

â™ª Don't give up on me â™ª
