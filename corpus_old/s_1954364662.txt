Stay with him, he's your

Mic: Follow me.
(muttering, breathing)
Stay with me guys!

Mic: Incoming! This way.
Follow me, follow me!

Tank: Recover north!
On our way!

Mic: Stay with me guys!
Ahh! Ah!

Mic: There's something down
there, I tripped over something.
Check it out!

Mic: Check around, there must
be something with that pipe.

Incoming!
Get them down,
get them down!

Mic: Right around where I was.
(overlapping chatter)

Mic: It's coming, it's coming
fast.

Perimeter, people!
give me a perimeter!

(overlapping chatter)

Big Guy: It's some
kind of tunnel.
Mic: Tank, come here.

What the fuck?




General X: At 0300, I received
a Code 455.

This was one of two
of the last remaining,

non-infected, virus free
women on the planet.

At 0200, her life ended.

A victim of the OVT virus.

This...

...is the last non-infected,

virus free, fertile woman
alive.

She is your Package.

This female is to be shipped
off planet immediately.

At 1700 tonight,
along with the Package,

you will board the Oklahoma.

At 1800 you will be cryoslept

for a seven month travel.

Your 10-TSA
destination...

Earth Two.

The rumors are true.

We have been preparing a planet
for inhabitation.

Four years'
projected completion.

The Oklahoma will
land adjacent to a heavily
wooded area.

You will secure the Package
off the ship.

Walk the Package
200 feet to a transport.

Secure the Package
on the transport.

Our nation has asked
for the best unit.

A unit that has never
lost a single Package.

You are that unit.

Let me be crystal,

should a situation arise.

Her pain, strain,
cries or demands

are of no significance.

Not to me,
not to you.

This Package gets delivered.

Thank you, Tank.

(alien noises)


(alien chirping)


Mic: Ahhhh!

(roaring continues)

What the fuck is that?

How you wanna play this, chief?

(click, beeps)


Sniper: Get down!

Down!



Tank: Doc.

Tank: Doc!


Tank: Snoop!

Snoop: Oh, Jesus.

Snoop, go get the Doc.

Yeah.

Sniper: Did we stop it?
Tank: Just be still, man.

Snoop: Doc, we need you.
Let's go.

Doc: I'm not,
I'm not leaving her.

Snoop: We're not leaving her.
Come on, you come with me.

Doc: Can you move your legs
or your feet?

Doc: The knife.

Doc: Can you feel that?
Sniper: No.

Doc: Can you feel that?

Sniper: Feel what?

Doc: He's intact.
Back's not broke.

Doc: Could wear-- (dirt
falling)

(muffled digging)

Tank: Snoop!
Snoop: I'm on it!

Sniper: Snoop, talk to me.

Snoop: I'm working on it,
I don't see anything yet,
I'm not through.

Doc: We have to move

Snoop: Few more seconds.

Sniper: You got eyes?
Snoop: No, not yet.

Doc: Can we at least
move away from this?

Snoop: Just give me time.

Sniper: Come on man,
this is taking too long.

Doc: I wanna get out of here.
I-I wanna go, I wanna leave.

Sniper: We definitely have
company in here.

Sniper: Ah, fuck.
Okay, the order.

Protocol.
Tank leads.

Then Package.
Doc, go.

Doc: I'm gonna leave,
Doc: I'm gonna get outta here.
Tank: You bring him Snoop!

Sniper: Go!
Tank: Move!

Sniper: Snoop.

Snoop: I-I'm looking I don't --

Snoop: Give me a minute,
I-I've gotta find it.

Sniper: We don't have
a fucking minute!

Sniper: Talk to me, come on --

Sniper: -- keep talking to me!
Snoop: I-I don't see anything --

Snoop: Hol-hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

Sniper: Can't see nothing?!
Snoop: Let me move it around,
hold on, hold on!

(frantic breathing)

Doc: Can one of you
tell me what the hell
just happened up there?

Doc: I thought this planet was
classified blue?

Tank: (breathing heavily)
It was blue.
It was, I --

Sniper: Gimme a minute, I-I can
see this through my goggles,
there's nothing --

Sniper: Well, stick your ear
to the hole.
Snoop: I'm --

(Frantic breathing)

(lock clicks)

Snoop: There's nothing there.
Shit.

Tank: When I say,
you're gonna pull this lever.

Tank: As soon as it opens, you
gotta turn this,

and you're gonna
yank the door open.

Tank: As soon as it opens,
you get behind it and stay back!

Sniper: Jesus Christ.

(heavy breathing)

Tank: Now!

(hatch door clicks, opens)

Sniper: Snoop?

(flashlight thud echoes
in tunnel)

(growling, loud thud,
dirt falling)
Sniper: Snoop!

(long roar)

Snoop: Tank!

Snoop: Tank!

Tank: Crawl!
We gotta crawl!

Snoop: We gotta what?!

Tank: (Yelling)
We have to, craw --!

Doc: How do you know
those things aren't in there?

Tank: Doc...

Tank: Rifle.

(tunnel creaking)

Snoop: Go, we gotta
get outta here.

Sniper: Ah, ah, ugh.
Snoop: Come on, come on.


Snoop: Come on, man.
Hold tight.
Sniper: Ah! Ah!

Tank: Let's go!

Snoop: Okay, hold on.

Snoop: Grab the gear,
and get us the hell outta here.


Snoop: I'm gonna get up
in this hole,
and I'll pull you up.

Snoop: Hold tight Snipe.

(heavy breathing)

Tank: Okay --

Tank: Rest for minute,
but stay to the side
and stay down.

(heavy breathing)

(hatch door clicks, latches)

Snoop: The door's closed.

Snoop: Snipe.

Snoop: (muffled) Hey!
The door's closed!

Snoop: (muffled)
Damn.

Snoop: What the? Snipe!

Snoop: (muffled)

(earth moving)


Sniper: Come on, come on!

(gunshots, earth moving)

Come on.
I got you.


Snoop: Fuck!

(muffled growling and screaming)

Doc: Tank --

Tank: Doc --

Package: You don't think it
stopped it, do you?

Package: Tank?

Tank: Be quiet, okay?

I need to hear this thing
because if I can't hear it,

I don't hear it coming.
All right?

Tank: Come on.


(breathing, tunnel creaking)

Tank: Okay, let's move.

(distant banging)

(more distant banging)

Doc: Anybody hear that?

(distant banging)

Tank: Get to the side.

(distant banging)

Tank: Doc, get your light
down there.

(distant banging)

Tank: Lean back.
Back!

Tank: Doc, come here.

Doc: Why, why am I going
up there?

Tank: Shh! You handle a gun?

Doc: No.

Tank: It's easy.
Point. Shoot.

Tank: I need you in the front.

Doc: I lost my glasses.
I can't see anything.

Tank: Don't worry
about your glasses --

Doc: I need my glasses --
Tank: Just get up here, Doc!

Tank: I need you to stay
in the front,

and keep your gun
down the tunnel.

Doc: When you will you be back?
Tank: Look at me!

Tank: You keep your gun
down the tunnel,
and you keep quiet.

Tank: If you see anything,
you let me know, okay?

Doc: All right, yeah.

Tank: Move.
Package: Tank.

Tank: Shh. Move.

Doc: When are you, when are --
Tank: Move Doc!

Tank: Package,
I need you up here.
Come on move!

(Distant banging - louder)

Tank: Move!

(distant banging)

(distant hatch door creaking)

(distant banging - louder)


Tank: Package, go.

Tank: Come on, go.

Tank: Wait! Be quiet!

Tank: Snoop!

Snoop: Hail! Hail!
Tank: Snoop!

Tank: Where's Snipe?

Snoop: He didn't make it.

Snoop: What are you doing
back here?

Tank: I got Doc up front.

Snoop: Doc?

I need you up there,
get your damn head
in the game!

You need to get up front now!

Snoop: Tank.

Snoop: She's the only thing
that matters now.

Tank: Get to the side!
Snoop: Let her through.

Snoop: Doc I need you to do
everything Tank tells you,
to the tee!

Snoop:Let me know
what you see.

Tank: All right, keep close.

Tank: Come on.

Tank: Wait, wait!
Hold up!

Snoop: (whispered)
What do you see, Tank?

Tank: (whispered) It's a room.

Snoop: Let's go.
Is it clear?

Tank: The tunnel
keeps going, but --

Tank: -- but there's
a room here.

Tank: It's clear, come on!
Get back here!

Snoop: Package, you follow!

Snoop: Let's go people, we
gotta move!

Tank: Can't see shit.

Snoop: Package, Doc,
opposite corners.

Doc: If we could stay
here a while,
it'd be good for her to rest.

She's gonna need --

Snoop: Five minutes,
then we move.

Doc: I know you're in charge.

Doc: I understand that,
and agree with that.

Doc: The human body can regain
almost all it needs --
30 minutes of sleep.

Doc: Thirty minutes,
she's as good as new.

Doc: Without it, in about
an hour we're dragging her.

Snoop: Can't afford to make
a mistake on this.

Snoop: What ever the hell
this thing is,

it's been ripping through
us like paper mache.

Tank: Snoop, she does
look pretty beat.
Package: I can go.

Snoop: Listen, you got
fifteen minutes.

Snoop: And that's it!
Doc: Thank you.

Snoop: Let's just hope you're
thanking me if --

(roaring, screeching
and gurgling)

Package: (screams)
(roaring, screeching continues)

Tank: Get in the tunnel!

Snoop: (screams)

Snoop: (distant) Tank...

Tank...

(growling, devouring sounds)

Snoop: (screams)

Doc: What was that?
What was that?!

Tank: Move!

Tank: What is your problem?

Package: He's -- he's not good
in tight spaces.

Tank: You're not good
in tight spaces?

Doc: I'm not.

Tank: You get your ass
down that tunnel
or I'm leaving you here!

Tank: Get the gun and move!

Tank: Get up here, get up here.

Tank: Doc, keep going.

Tank: Move!

Doc: Maybe we should stop?
Tank: Doc, if you don't move --

(overlapping arguments)

Tank: Let's go.
Go.

Doc: Stop! Stop!
Tank: (whispers) What?

Doc: There's something up here.

Tank: (whispers)
Get to the side.

Tank: Shh!

Tank: Come on.

(tunnel creaking)

(distant banging)

Tank: Do what you can,
but we're not staying long.

Tank: Calm down, I'll tell you
when I'm needing the bathroom.

Tank: Take these, rip 'em.
Wrap her hands and her knees.

Package: (coughing)

Tank: I got a plan.

Tank: Doc, get that gun.
I need you to cover the tunnel.

Tank: Package,
you stay down.

Doc: Where are you going?

(tunnel creaking)

(tunnel creaking)

(slow breathing)

Doc: I don't like this.

Tank: Ok, alright.

(loud metal clang)

Tank: (whispered) Ok, come on.

Tank: Come on.

Doc: This plan is not
about how we all three
are getting up there, is it?

Tank: If it moves over
those lights,
we're gonna see it.

Tank: And maybe if I can get
one shot into this thing
we can kill it.

Doc: Wait, we're waiting
for this thing?

Doc: Not once, not once
have we been able
to stop this thing.

Tank: Not once have
we gotten a clean shot.

Doc: Everybody trying to kill
this thing is dead.

Tank: Look, you cover
that tunnel, Doc.
Now I think we can kill it!

Doc: We're not waiting
for this thing to come
down here and eat us!

Doc: I don't like this.
I'd rather run.

Tank: We got thirty feet.
If I don't stop it,
if I can't stop it,

we'll know in plenty of time,
and you guys get in that tunnel.

Package: How are gonna get up
without help?

Tank: I can climb anything.
I can!

(tunnel creaking)

(gun clicks)
Doc: Did you stop it?
Tank: I don't know, go!

Tank: Go!
Doc: She doesn't stand a chance
with me.

Doc: Not a chance.
You go.

Doc: Soon we're gonna
run out of water,
and it doesn't matter anyway.

Tank: (heavy breathing)
All right, all right.

Tank: You got a full clip, okay?

Tank: I don't know, maybe
there's a weak point.

Tank: Okay?
Doc: I'll be fine. I'll be
fine.

Doc: Go.

Tank: Package!

Tank: (grunts)

Tank: We gotta keep moving.
Come on, come on!


(faint wind)

Package: (whispered)
Do you hear that?
What is it?

(distant roar and growling)

(tunnel creaking)

Tank: Okay.

Tank: I want you to stay here
until I say, okay?
Package: Okay.

Tank: If you hear anything,
you call me, you got it?

Tank: Don't move until I say.

Tank: All right.

(louder wind sound)

(lighter clicks)
Tank: Come on.

(wind whistling)

Tank: Fu...
God.

Tank: Please, please.

Tank: Ok, come on!
Come on!

Tank: Get up.

Tank: Get in the corner,
come on.


(distant growling)

Tank: Fuck!

(tunnel creaking)



Tank: You have a choice now.

Tank: We can stay here...

And fight this thing.

I can't --

I will fight it...

As hard as I can.


Tank: Or...

I can end this for you now.

Before it gets...

Messy...

And painful.

Because it will.

(metal creaking)


Tank: Or...

I can take you down that tunnel.

Maybe to the end, but...

All the air was coming
from that pipe.

That tunnel's dead.


(metal creaking)
Tank: That's all I can
offer you.

A choice.
A choice.

But it's yours.


Package: Tank...

Package: I don't wanna die.


Tank: Fuck.

(metal creaking)

Tank: Then let's get the fuck
outta here!


Tank: Okay.
drink this.

Package: (coughing)
Tank: Put this on.

Tank: Okay, hold that.

Tank: I'll go in first,
and you stay close
behind me, all right?

Tank: When you can't crawl
anymore, I'll drag you.
Package: Thank you.

Soldier: Is the Package safe?

Tank: No.

(muffled roar)

Tank: That thing is down there.

Tank: Hey, that thing.

Soldier: We know that thing's
still down there.

Soldier: You probably figured
out your bullets won't kill 'em,
but we know what will.

Soldier: Fire.

Soldier: We got a torch crew
who's been coming around
and burning them out for us.

We've been looking
down these holes,
looking for you guys.

We'll contact them,
they'll be here.

Tank: Fire?

Tank: Fire kills it?

Soldier: Seems to be
the only thing that does.

(muffled growling)

Tank: Get back.


Soldier: Stand back.



(muffled screeching)

Tank: How far is the base?

Soldier: It's two miles
from here.

(footsteps squishing in the mud)

Soldier 1: Not even
a thank you.
What a bitch.

Soldier 2: Yeah she may be
a bitch,

but that's probably one

Soldier 1: What's her name?

Soldier 2: Her name?
