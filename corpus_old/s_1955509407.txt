      (echoing footsteps)       

    - Where'd you come from?    

      What are you doing?       

     - [Tall Hat] Waiting.      

          - For what?           

     - [Tall Hat] Waiting.      

          - [Tall Hat]          
    For somethin' to happen.    

     - I'm not supposed to      
    talk to strangers so...     

     - [Tall Hat] Sensible.     

     - I'm not supposed to      
    talk to strangers so...     

          That's Dee.           

        And that's John.        

           I'm Wyeth.           

Now that we know each other,    
we're no longer strangers.      

           I'm Wyeth.           

That's a hell of a scar, Jake,

           I'm Wyeth.           

       how'd you get it?        

           I'm Wyeth.           

How do you know my name?      

           I'm Wyeth.           

     - What were you doing      
        when you got it?        

           I'm Wyeth.           

     - [John] Maybe she was     
    running, maybe she fell.    

           I'm Wyeth.           

Why were you running, Jake?   

           I'm Wyeth.           

To get help from my Grandpa,  

           I'm Wyeth.           

      Sheriff Waterhouse.       

           I'm Wyeth.           

             - Why?             

    - [John] I bet you miss     
    your brother, don't you?    

             - Why?             

     - Of course she does.      

             - Why?             

You like magic, right, Jake?    

        (ominous music)         

You like magic, right, Jake?    

         - [Jake] Sure.         

You like magic, right, Jake?    

       - Well, what sorta       
    trick do you wanna see?     

You like magic, right, Jake?    

She wants her brother back.   

You like magic, right, Jake?    

      - That's impossible.      
     - You sure about that?     

       - Slow down, John.       

      - That's impossible.      
     - You sure about that?     

You seem pretty sure about that.

          Is it empty?          

            - Yeah.             

        - Give it here.         

            - Yeah.

        (ominous music)         

We got a lot to talk about.     

          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

         [Mom arguing]          

          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

        [Dad] I told her        
        to wait for me!         

          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

        (fire crackling)        

       Come closer, child.      

There's no reason you can't     
have your brother back, Jake.   

     - I don't understand.      

            (thud)              

     - I don't understand.      

Go on, don't be afraid.       

     - I don't understand.      

           (laughing)           

           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

        The rules of the        
     game are not as fixed      

           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

as you think they are, Jake.    

           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

       But nothin' comes        
       for nothin', right?      

           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

     We all want somethin'.     

           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

       We can bring your        
      brother back to life,     

        but somebody has        
       to take his place.       

       We can bring your        
      brother back to life,     

          - Like who?           

What about your little        
boyfriend Willie Proctor?       

          - Like who?           

    - He's not my boyfriend.    
           - Exactly.           

          - Like who?           

       If he were to take       
      your brother's place      

          - Like who?           

you could have Sean back.       

          - Like who?           

       - Well what do you       
     guys want with Willie?     

          - Like who?           

     - Nobody'll miss him.      

      Everybody at school       
       makes fun of him,        

     - Nobody'll miss him.      

     he's fucked up, right?     

     - Nobody'll miss him.      

So what's the big deal?       

You make Willie disappear and   
your family's happy again.      

So what's the big deal?       

       - Yeah, maybe your       
     mama won't be so sad.      

So what's the big deal?       

       - What do you say?       

      Now you bring Willie      
     Proctor to the quarry.     

When he goes off the ledge      
you'll get your brother back.   

      Now you bring Willie      
     Proctor to the quarry.     

     Should we shake on it?     

        (ominous music)         

         - We got her.          

[Byron] Copy that, Sheriff.   

         - We got her.          

         - [Isabel] Oh!         
       Oh, we missed you.       

         - We got her.          

        - [Dad] Honey we        
       love you so much.        

         - We got her.          

       - [Isabel] You're        
       sure you're okay?        

         - We got her.          

   - [Dad] Hey I told you to    
          wait for me.          

         - We got her.          

    - Just leave her alone.     
          - Hey, hey.           

         - We got her.          

             Easy.              

         - We got her.          

 Jake, why don't you come over  
here and tell me what happened. 

         - We got her.          

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

        and then I just         
      decided to walk home,     

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

     and when I was walking     
       through the woods        

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

       I saw this man in        
     the old train tunnel.      

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

         - [Dad] What?          

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

       - Go ahead, go on.       

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

There were like three men,    

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

      but I can't remember      
          their names.          

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

     - These three men, did     
    they do anything to you?    

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

       - They just showed       
         me this trick.         

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

            - Jesus.            

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

           - A trick?           

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

       What kind of trick       
       did they show ya?        

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

Just some stupid magic trick. 

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

       I'd seen it before,      
        it was nothing.         

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

Could you identify these men? 

Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

    - Yeah, maybe. Probably     
      not, I don't know...      

Okay, so I was waiting for

Did you find that girl?

            - What?             

       Do you know, um...       

I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

     straight up. Willie's      
     granddaddy called me,      

I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

and he doesn't want you         
going anywhere near Willie,     

I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

       so just stay away.       

I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

        I hate like hell        
        to tell ya that.        

I know you're fond of him.      

And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

but you know, everything's      
gonna be alright, I promise you.

And I know that your

        - Looks like you        
       could use a hand.        

Didn't mean to scare you.

      - What'd you think?       

            (crying)            

Sorry to hear about your mom. 

Anything we can do to help?

Our offer still stands, child.

You know where to find us.      

        (chain jingles)         

            (crying)            

         - (muttering)          

      (projector whirring)      

         - (muttering)          

Your grandma sent this to me

         - (muttering)          

I've been wanting you to see it.

         - (muttering)          

      Seemed like tonight       
       was a good night.        

         - (muttering)

         - (muttering)          

      sent me, so I traded      
       the projectionist        

         - (muttering)          

     a bottle of whiskey,

         - (muttering)          

         (gentle music)         

         - (muttering)          

     The men went bananas.      

He showed it four times before  
they'd let the feature start.   

     The men went bananas.      

It reminded them of their own.  

Their own families,             
their own wives and kids.       

       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

he tracked me down and he       
said hey I need that film back  

       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies

       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

    and he said well the men    
    have demanded to see it,    

       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

    they demanded to see it.

They want to see it next Sunday

      You know your mother      
        and your grandma        

      and Ingrid Bergman.       

      You know your mother      
        and your grandma        

They'd like to wear it out

     I had to steal it back     
    the last time (laughs).     

They'd like to wear it out

     with my granddaughter?     

What the hell is going on?

        here I see you.         

    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

       - These men aren't       
     who they say they are.     

    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

Their intentions are ungodly.   

           (cock rifles)        

Their intentions are ungodly.   

     These are marked men.      

What makes you think I

Go on, get it over with.      

     - [Wyeth] Nah, not yet.    

  - You hurt my granddaughter,  
  I swear...                    

I wouldn't hurt a single

  - You hurt my granddaughter,  
  I swear...

        do it right now.        

    If it's any consolation,    

      she'll probably get       
       away with murder.        

    If it's any consolation,    

     But she'll be haunted      
      the rest of her life      

    If it's any consolation,    

        by what she did.

somebody has to take his place. 

        When you go on a

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

and that is no man's all good,  

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

no man's all bad neither.       

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

     There are no cowards,      
      there are no heroes,      

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

        there's only the        
      living and the dead.      

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

I don't believe in hell neither,
otherwise I'd be there.         

        - I learned one         
      thing during the war,     

    It's hard to know what's    
       right or wrong...        

  unless you're sitting on the  
      outside lookin' in.       

See there isn't a day that      
goes by that I don't regret     

what happened to that woman     
and that I could've stopped it. 

See there isn't a day that      
goes by that I don't regret     

       I did one good--         

well, actually two good         
things, but only one is worth   

       I did one good--         

      a good goddamn, and       
      that is I came home       

       I did one good--         

to my wife and my daughter.     

       I did one good--         

            - Jake!             

             Jake.
