How is that sentence? Today is
the first day of the rest of my life.

Good-bye, Cleveland.

All told me that I didn't leave,
that it didn't pursue my dream... 

 ... but I should leave of here.

Because I think of my mother
and in that I can end up as her... 

He/she would prefer to be dead.

I have dreamt of this
all my life.

I will toss to all of less,
but I should go... 

 ... because if not, I will always wonder
what it had happened.

And although it fails,
at least I will have attempted it.

But I won't fail.

This will be worth something some day.

A million dollars.

Yes.

<i > Awake!</i>

<i > he/she Hears. He/she hears.
Are you awake?</i>

Do you have a cigarette for me?

I sit down it. I no longer smoke.

Do you have fire?

Well... 

This strategy
you do usually work?

Do you want me to leave?

Do you want to leave?

No, but I understand how it shines.

I suppose that your parents
they noticed you of the strangers.

Are you a stranger?

I don't believe it.

Are you me afraid?

Should he/she fear you?

No.

But you should fear him/her
to what I am thinking.

I believe that we will be
one in the life of the other one.

Seriously?

<i > Because you don't have it.</i>

And although you had it...

You not even know me.
Not you know my name.

How do you call yourself?

Clever, we already know each other.

Not I wanted to get scared.

It is that I had that premonition
when I saw you.

<i > as if... </i>

 ... there was a connection.

I suppose that he/she could attempt
to invite you to go out with me... 

 ... to take coffee or something.

<i > AND to wait to the best moment
to tell you that, but... </i>

I believe that he/she is direct better being.

I already said it.

And if I ate up a shark
later or something?

Then never he/she had told it to you.

That would be very sad.

And if I don't sit down
the same connection that you?

I sit down it.
I seem surely a lunatic.

Yes, it is certain.

If it continues in foot that of the coffee... 

 ... I will accept the invitation
before he/she eats you the shark.

I sit down it.

He/she opens the eyes, girl.

He/she hears.

We know that you don't have
anything why to get up.

Don't remind it to me.

<i > you Believe that some of your friends... </i>

<i >... want to go out with me... </i>

<i >... want to come with you
or to leave?</i>

No, I speak seriously.

Very well. Very well.

He/she spoke the subject with the Russian accent.

<i > Excellent.</i>

You are really excellent.

He/she was afraid.

Of what?

Of what he/she will say you if... 

It was bad.

But that was astonishing.

It is a good song.

As I said, it is not only the song.

Do you want browner?

No!

Only promise me that not... 
Is the chicken salad good?

Yes.

Promise me that they won't sign

<i >... until we speak.
Because I know how they are these things.</i>

Believe me.
If they go with mistaken people... 

 ... and they make a bad decision,
they will ruin everything.

<i > they will End up in an insignificant employment
winning the minimum salary.</i>

I believe that I will order
the chicken salad.

But I believe that I will break up with him.

But although he/she doesn't make it,

He was very poor all their life.

But he/she told me that when I was born... 

 ... he was very afraid... 

 ... of not being able to take care to itself
neither to me... 

 ... and that for that reason Will, "desire" called me.

Because he/she knew that if he/she had a desire... 

 ... he/she would always have... 

A what an one?
An exit.

Correct.

Do you want to drug yourself or what?

Not we have money.

I know it, but we have a desire.

<i >... he/she doesn't help you to improve your situation
social or economic.</i>

Are you an applicant to actress?
Model?

I am cantautora.

And do you make money with that?

Even not.

I suppose that you were born
in the center-west.

In Cleveland.

You believed that you would be a great success... 

<i >... but you were

<i > AND now you are waiting,
thinking in how to continue.</i>

I will achieve it.

Of what do you speak?

Mine, tell him/her of what I speak.

We assist to movie stars,
athletes, managers of studies... 

 ... musical producers.

<i > I have just bought a house
in Hollywood Hills.</i>

I drive a 500 CO.LTD.,
I make purchases in the street Rodeo.

I am a damned rock star.

Allow me to see if I understand.

You say that I will never be successful... 

 ... so I should open him/her the legs
to the best bidder.

And if I am lucky,
one of my clients... 

 ... if this way the flames,
it will be a musical producer... 

 ... that he/she will give me the opportunity
that I really want.

<i > Affection, I don't want to insult you.</i>

<i > you should be an excellent music.</i>

<i > I reacted equally, Hope.</i>

<i > But there is a quantity
of determined time... </i>

 ... in the life of a woman
in which the stars favor it.

You should consider it.

<i > you Have my card.</i>

<i > If you want that we see each other
to take coffee... </i>

<i >... we could speak... </i>

<i >... on an opportunity of businesses
very lucrative.</i>

All sell something.

<i > Not you wait
until it is too much afternoon.</i>

<i > Not I know what they want.</i>

<i > I gave Them everything, my heart,
my mind, everything... </i>

They still reject me.

An imbecile said that only
the losers renounce.

To the devil with that.
I can no longer make it.

<i > Carrie, Carrie.</i>

<i > I am Vince.
He/she answers if you are there!</i>

Give me that.
Curse!

The last time that you made this,
three of your former fiancés called me... 

 ... and they told me: You called "me
at 3:00" o'clock. Not be this way.

What does it happen?

I went to the bathroom... 

<i >... and this imbecile takes my telephone
and he/she begins to make calls... </i>

Can you be quiet for one second?

Do they know something of the fellow?

No.

He/she will call us.

Do you have some contact?

He/she calls to this number... 

 ... and tell him/her that you know me... 

 ... and he/she will bring them what you/they want.
Tell him/her that he/she brings me the usual thing.

<i > I Believed that you no longer consumed.
Do you consume another time?</i>

No, it is not for me,
it is for a friend.

<i > Hello.</i>

Skies, you scared me.

I sit down it.

Why do you work at night?

It is November 2.

And what with that?

What?

Anything.

Keith said that you were a good music.

<i > How does that go?</i>

You what you believe?

I believe that anything well.

Yes.

<i > What does it stop you?</i>

Why nobody never
does he/she want to be where it is?

It is bad that he/she wants to be
more than a waiter... 

 ... in this hell
for the rest of my life?

No.

<i > I sit down It, but I went by things
very bad in the past.</i>

And I try to accommodate my life.

Not I need you to bother me.

Do you fear to the death?

What?

If you fear to the death.

What devils does it happen tonight?

I sit down as if it was
among crazy.

It is well,
it was only a question.

Why do you ask it?

For curiosity.

And you?

No. No, I don't fear him/her.

Perhaps you don't fear him/her... 

 ... because you believe that you don't have
anything why to live.

different from the one that was... </i>

 ... trying to be somebody different.

But you can sit down
for one second?

Don't give my back!

<i > Friend, do you have some problem?</i>

So that they can negotiate
a treatment?

So that they use their psychology?
Maybe call to my mother... 

 ... and they make it come to speak to me for
last time. What do you believe, Hope?

They will ask me him to leave free
to some people.

I know the game. They will leave me
to think that I have the control...

No, thank you. No.

Tell them that they forget it. And tell them that

But it is never known
what could happen today.

It is in the bathroom.
He/she has an overdose.

Thomas will take out it of here.

Did he/she return with those fellows?
I don't like them.

Damned Hope.

Do you have money? Yes, I imagined it.

Where do you take me?

He/she neglects, you will be well.
Only relax you.

I made the same thing, you know.

He/she ran in circles... 

 ... looking for something that I was filled.

I realized that
it only escaped from myself.

Not I want to return to where I was.

He/she looks.

If you are as me and you want to live... 

 ... the only place
in the one that you can be... 

 ... it is right here.

Right now.

Why did you help me?
