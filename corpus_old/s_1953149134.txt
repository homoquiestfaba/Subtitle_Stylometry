'' NOAH'S ARK ''

Gomorrah! Gomorrah!

Sodom! Sodom!

Come!

The people of Sodom!

People of Gomorrah!

'' And God said to Noah:

' I decided to give cable
of all the meat ...

because the Earth is full
the violence of men.

Behold I will perish
along with the Earth '.

Lot! Lot!

Noah!

What happened?

-A coward stabbed me back here.
-Back where?

I will not be able to sit down.

And you, Mica?

I'm finished, Noah!
That leaves me to death and darkness.

Don't step on a spectrum.
Throw me in the nearest trench!

-Over.
-But who won?

And who lost?

-Sodom! Sodom!
-We Will! Kill him!

Sodom! Sodom!

-Feels better, Lot?
-More happy!

We survived.

Come on, can beat!

Death is far!
I still have years ahead!

Celebrate Noah!
We're alive!

This is the best part of war!
Wine, women ...

-Shut up!
-... and music.

Dismiss the song
If you have enough women and wine!

It is not for the orgy?

This all disgusts me!
I just hope God understands ...

It is my duty as a citizen
help my hometown.

-That God is this?
-The God of us all.

Not the God of Sodom and Gomorrah.

No, unfortunately.

Where is he?
Where he lives?

For me, he is on Earth ...

at sea, in the air we breathe.
It is all around us, Lot.

Although no one can see it.

-Truth.
-Or hear it.

Maybe, Yes.

It is very convenient. As it came
to know that your God?

I do not know.

Noah ...

you are my oldest friend,
and I love him like a brother.

But is every day more strange.
So, comment that is crazy.

But you have a good heart.

I must warn his wife
You will arrive soon?

Yes, tell him that I needed to rest.
I'm hurt.

Know that always take
along with me.

It's better than having
that kiss her to leave.

You two are like cat and mouse.

Come with me.
Come with me.

Not joking!

-Take care, buddy.
-You too.

Wait! Wait for me!

Where it goes?
This is the best part of the war.

Makes it all worthwhile!
It is very weird.

He is the best man
you know.

Critique it again,
and I tear off your heart!

Can talk! Speak!

You're drunk again?

Beautiful killing!
Wanted to have participated.

Would have killed one or two, you can believe.

Now arrasaremos Gomorrah!

Save them.
They will make good slaves.

What a beautiful booty! Valuable!

Naama!

Are you okay?
Is injured?

I'm fine, honey.

We learned that won
a great battle.

We Won.

It was terrible?

Is a duty or not ...

I never do that. Swear.

Are you okay
that's what matters.

I'll call children.

Boys!
See who has arrived! Come!

-No!
-Father! How was it?

Daddy!

-Daddy!
-Fast!

-Brought us something?
-I missed.

-Father! How many killed?
-Cam.

How was it? Conte!

-Afraid?
-You danced and sang ...

... when he won, father?
-Must have killed hundreds!

-Not killed anyone.
-Brought us something?

A keepsake sword?

-Or the ear of an enemy?
-Or a nose?

Nobody has a nose of Gomorrah!
We would put on sideboard!

Boys, his father traveled a lot.
Is tired.

-Let him rest.
-Sure, MOM.

We'll talk later.

-Thank to back it.
-We Will.

Rest, dad.

Sleep well.

So much killing and destruction!

They all think that is right.
Only I think is wrong?

No, you're not wrong.

Who said this?
Who said this?

I am the Lord God,
creator of heaven and Earth.

It's really the Lord God?

-IS IT?
-Yes. It's me, Noah.

But talks with my voice!

Of Course. I am the creator.
His voice is mine.

My voice is in everything.
Listen carefully.

We have little time. Humanity
became poor and forgotten how to listen.

Only you, Noah, remained
pure enough ...

Therefore, you can still hear me.
I want you to go ...

... to the top of Mount Veovis.
-Monte Veovis?

-Why?
-I'll be waiting for you ...

... on top of Mount Veovis.
-Can you explain to my wife ...

I follow Your orders?
I just got back, you know?

-She'll understand.
-But ...

Trust me, have faith. Because
you, Noah, was chosen by me.

I?

But, Sir ...

-Monte Veovis.
-Mr?

I talked with God.

Yes?

I talked with God,
and He answered me.

What he said?

Had me go up Mount Veovis
to speak with him again.

He sent, is it?

Naama ... God spoke to me.

It is true!

Still not told us about the war
and the killing, father.

As we boast?

Kill is not subject
to brag, son.

-Doesn't like to kill, father?
-The Lord God does not approve.

-But everyone kills.
-So he is bravo.

-He told you this, father?
-No, but I know.

-Knows a lot about God, isn't it?
-Almost nothing.

But I know more than the others.
We will work.

Should feel proud, father.

Remember the story of the boy who,
so proud ...

turned into a bee,
whizzing, whizzing ...

There I go!

Stops!

-Gotcha!
-Just.

Comes to play.
Let's get back to work.

-Noah, Lot's wife is here.
-Where is my husband?

He will return with the army.

Why not back with you?

He was injured.

Injured? Ah, '' injured ''!
I know, I know.

He invents all
not to go home.

When summoned the army,
He was the first to offer.

All it took was the official say:
'' We want you ''. And he said: '' Yes ''!

And ran out the door!

And I know very well that you
is the best friend of his ...

... and you guys are together!
-Does not need to be aggressive.

Aggressive?

I'm never aggressive!

I have strong temperament,
but I do not fight.

Mother, that is why Lot
don't want to go back?

Close your eyes!

I'll leave to the monte Veovis today.

And before I go,
sooner I come back.

Will not discuss?

When the subject is the Lord,
I decided not to discuss.

You always discusses.
Mr or non-Lord.

Yes. Because I love you.

Boys, come here!

I'll be out five days ago. Want
take care of his mother and they are good.

-In what order, father?
-Do both at the same time.

I'm breathless.
I ate too much.

Naama is good wife,
but a terrible Cook.

Unable to burn water.
Remember the pooch that she ate.

And not fled. Could barely walk!

But, even after so many years,
a look it me flood the soul!

Hello! Mr!

It's me, Noah. I arrived.

I am here!

Mr?

Mr?

I came from afar.

Noah? I am here.

-Mr.
-I'm here ...

patiently waiting.
As you said it would be.

Why asked me to come here?

I have shocking news for you.

Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed.

Sodom and Gomorrah?

By fire and brimstone ...

because they have become
an abomination.

My creation, Noah.
That I loved.

And all ...

will perish?

All ...

least you, Noah.
You must pick up your family ...

and out of Sodom immediately.

-But Sodom is our home!
-tap her right away!

But how will I know that the Lord
is who is telling it is?

Maybe it's too early
to ask you to have faith.

Need a sign, Noah?

Wouldn't hurt.

Get off the mountain.
Now. Now!

I'm going!

The signal was enough, Noah?

-Up too, Mr.
-Exit with his family from Sodom.

Fast, there is little time.

-There is no way to save it, Sir?
-Save it?

-Is my homeland.
-Nothing would give me more pleasure.

Could cite fifty people
well who live there?

Fifty?

Could be ten?

Very well. Get quote
ten Honorable people ...

Sodom is saved.

Thank You, Mr.

Beware!

See where pisa, Noah.

Fifty? Of Sodom?

Get lower to ten.

We need to make a list
ten Honorable people.

Well, Lot is a.

I wouldn't say that Lot is honored.

But he is a good friend.

And is cousin of your worthless
brother Obadia, then it is relative.

-Very far.
-And his wife?

She has a tongue so ferina
as your mood.

She is very spiteful.
I guess I never helped anyone.

But it is his wife.

-Okay, are two.
-Great.

And the ...

Nataniel?

That old goat sleeps with
very young! Very very young.

Better choose Jerome.

Jerome sleeps with boys.
And Jeremiah?

Jeremiah is sleeping
with the wife of Joshua.

Ah, no. You must know some
virtuous woman in Sodom.

Ah, Yes ...

Has the ...

Not. Ah, you have the ...

No, she ... She serves no purpose.

What about ...?

No, does not pay.

Sorry.

I Am Sorry,
I don't know any.

I'm sorry.

We both need to think.

We already have two to
to recommend to the Lord.

We need to find out eight more.

So, who do we have?

Lot and his wife.

So the Lord
Let me cite ten.

He knew that would not give, fifty
without cheating.

And if I trapaceasse,
He would know.

Bedtime, Naama.

Doesn't take too long, my well.

I found ten Honorable people
to quote, Lord, without cheating ...

except Lot and his wife.

And I am not happy with them.

So Sodom and Gomorrah
will end up?

They are already marked in my book.

You should start from tomorrow,
before noon ...

and neither do you, or your family
must look back.

-Why not, Sir?
-Will be tempted to come back ...

and to help those condemned to death.

lgnorem their cries for help.

Nothing can do for them.

-The city will be destroyed this evening.
-What?

You will be saved,
breaking with his wife.

-Do not want to leave.
-Don't look back.

-Noah? Who told you that?
-God.

-God ...
-There is no time to explain.

But I never lied to you.
Get out of here.

-Noah?
-And don't look back!

What that fool wanted?

What Noah came to do
here so early?

-He's my best friend!
-Why? I never understood that.

-Have nothing in common!
-Noah is my only friend ...

that is happy
Whenever I'm happy.

Your friend happy
threw me into a bucket of dye!

So what?

'' So what? ''
Is everything you know say?

So what?

I married you
because it was love at first sight.

If I looked right,
I would have fled running!

His problem was that you said
to be yourself!

-I will.
-Will? Going?

Great. Prior had already gone!

-Goes where?
-Noah spoke ...

that Sodom is destroyed
This night.

You can stay if you want.

I will though!

I get!

-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!

-We Will! Let's go!
-Skirt!

-What are you doing?
-Do not want us to steal!

-There is nothing of value.
-Who is to blame?

You're a do-it-all
that does nothing!

MOM said that you
was going to start at the bottom ...

... and down even more!
-His mother ...

has a mouth so large that account
secret in the ear!

The discussion is particularly
or open to everyone?

Where are you going?

My husband thinks that Sodom
will be destroyed tonight!

-You drank, Lot?
-Not. Lot only drink to calm down.

Sometimes, it is so quiet
that can't move.

Can mock ...

What a shame!

Be mocked
for people of this ilk!

I cannot more cycling head
erected in society! Never again!

Release me!
This is repulsive!

-Where we are going, Dad?
-I do not know.

Let's not get wandering
around without a home.

The Lord is our guiding star
and will show us the way.

It's almost time.

God will destroy everyone now?

Don't look back!
I do not look!

They will look, if not do something.

Sales!

Cam, come here.

-What will happen, MOM?
-I'm afraid.

-Me too.
-Hang on in cart.

steady.

Hang on in cart.

Why can't I look back?

Why can't I look back?
that is madness!

Not that I was seeing
our House here. It's so tiny!

Thanks to you, we went from obscurity
to oblivion!

I didn't know what it was happiness
until I marry you.

Now it's too late. Pronto.

You don't deserve it!

I had sweat malignant,
also without merit! Listen!

Learned to live one day at a time. AND
envision that today is a special day.

Hopefully. After so much effort!

It is now.

Cam?

Help, please!

Let's ride!
Is happening!

Is happening!
Exactly how Noah spoke!

He hit, once in a lifetime!
I ask forgiveness! I Will Ask!

Will the South side of the city
is being destroyed?

Where are the wealthy houses?
They neither spoke with us!

Nose always prancing!
I need to look!

-Do not look!
-I need to see this, Lot!

All those people in snubbing!

Laughing hidden.
Mica and wife mocking us.

Now they are not mocking!
Are burning!

They are burning!

-I need to look!
-No!

You never let me do anything.
I can never enjoy myself.

I want to have fun!

Ah, my dear ...

I warned you.

Continue pushing.
Continue!

Continue walking.

We are going to generate.
Lies between Kadesh and Shur.

And what we'll do there?

We are farmers.

What do you mean farm?

Anything.
We are in the hands of the Lord!

Lahey? Lahey? Why?
We are marketers.

What we understand of the plantation?
Goats and cabbages, that's all.

Generate!

Good day, friend.

-Came the Canyon?
-Come, friend.

You heard, Morab?
We may pass.

Don't shake your head at me.
We go to Sodom.

Our harvest
has been scarce here, friends.

Few farmers
they don't buy anything!

Now we will go to Sodom.
Is where the money is!

Sodom ended.

-Is destroyed. Dead.
-Became smoke.

Bang! Poof!

Life is full of sadness and pain.

Sometimes, I think ...

It was better not to have been born.

Ever met someone
lucky in life?

How it happened?

God destroyed them
because they were bad.

A religious issue?

that only confirms ... Do not stir
with religion. It's not worth it.

I always focused on ...
profit.

I believe ...

that all evil in the world
derives from the fact ...

God has not created money
enough, for starters.

There is something pure and decent
in the money.

Well, but ...

would be interested
in something?

Everything your hearts and hands
wish! Ribbons, trinkets!

Pots, pans, toys!
Hats.

Hats for the family!
Hats!

-Boys!
-Makes a lot of heat in generate.

It doesn't rain for months.

Need hats
because of the Sun.

No, thank you.

Gorgeous.

-How beautiful!
It is here that God ...

... the Lord of the worlds, wants us to.
-Give me that! Is mine!

We will climb the mountain!

TEN YEARS DEPOlS ...

lmpossível create beauty
without good raw material.

They will make the cut.
Want to be beautiful.

Are very elegant, guys.

Care. No confusion.
Do not let the acuem.

Talk of neighbors,
not women.

-We don't want turmoil, father.
-Does not happen anything.

They fear us.
We are different.

And are the same.

Can go.

Is a temple to Mole,
the rain God.

These people have a God
for each thing.

And no successful.
Look at this.

Our God is different.
Unique. Only a God.

I think this makes it easier. Pray
for a God, instead of hundreds.

And of course top
This bunch of losers.

In fact, Noah,
everything is a miracle and a prodigy.

A miracle and a prodigy. You
always finds the right words.

And you think the words behind
of the words, the more blurred ...

and, behind them, the silence.

Is shaking, dear.

Is fear. Always fear by the boys
When they go to the village.

They are hated there. The staff
can do something against them.

Where is everyone?

The Ester ...?

-Who is it?
-Another person.

-Who is it?
-Is Without!

Don't get stopped there.
Between!

What's happening?

Ruth?

Ruth?

My little girl ...

What happened?
Where is Ruth?

-Where is Ruth?
-They took my daughter.

-Who?
-The priests of the temple.

Stay there.

Never again will I see it!

-There will be struggle.
-Need help.

-Call the father.
-I will not wait.

He will know that we need it.

Soft! Soft! Soft!

I forgot what we
make this night.

You will sacrifice a Virgin
for Mole, the rain God.

-For what?
-To have rain!

-He is gaga.
-We will have to elect another.

Rain?
Ah, Yes. Of course, rain!

This is not a small Ruth?
Why we euthanize it?

Was the only Virgin
We think that hurry!

-If there were more time ...
-Even so, it would be difficult.

-They go rare!
-But I know Ruth ...

Since she was little.

Sacrifice chickens, sheep,
Bulls, and it didn't work.

-Hello, Darling. How will your mother?
-Don't do it!

Want to be the first to choke you!

This young will kindly
sacrificing himself to save us.

With all reverence, we will
offer it to the great God Mole!

He rewards his followers
with the vital waters of the heavens!

-Sacrifice-in!
-Kill it!

Ruth!

Get It!
Come on, let's go!

Pick Up!

-Ruth?
-Kill the girl!

And others!
They are foreigners. And crazy!

And you're the craziest,
After his father.

As says this?
I'm courting his daughter Esther!

I'm your future son-in-law.

Dad?

Kill him!

Knock it off!

Since domei my hate,
I keep it saved.

But, when it is necessary, I use.

And I will use it now!
Drop them! Go away from here!

-Or, what will you do?
-You came to take our land!

-And our women!
-Your crop grows, our no!

-He is a wizard!
-Kill it too.

And she!

Kill Noah!
He is just a man.

I have the Lord's army
by my side!

-Is a lie!
-That good. Hold it!

Mr? It's your turn.

What the Lord has done with Sodom
and Gomorrah, he will be with you.

-Only worse.
-What would he do worse?

Not got me!

Where is the light?
Where is the Moon?

What said?
Don't listen to anything. Nothing!

-Can't see!
-I'm deaf!

Why it took so much?

Noah, I have a task for you.
You build me an Ark.

-300 cubits in length.
-Build what?

-Wood.
-Wooden? I am not a constructor.

You also not farmer
but thrived!

But 300 cubits in length
gives a 50 wide, and is very high!

I think big.
I made the world in six days.

But how do I ...?

Is seeing one branch there?

Yes, this same. Grab it.

Now draw.

What is this?

-Something that I need to build.
-What?

-An Ark.
-A what?

An Ark.

What is this?

Is a boat.

-For that you need a boat?
-Is for the Lord.

Mr?
We need to talk.

Yes? I'm listening to.

-When you want the Ark ready?
-tap her right away. Or rather, up.

My family and I cannot
do alone. We are only four.

Stop drinking.

Will produce more.

Don't drink when I'm working.

Then hire helpers.

I tried. I tried.

All I think ...

... crazy.
-Know.

I'll have to help him again, Noah.

We thank you. After All,
We are acting in good faith.

Without knowing what to do,
or why we do. Or not ...

Noah, you have been very clear.
Now go to sleep.

Will have a heavy day tomorrow.

Sure, Sir.

-Good night.
-Good evening, Noah.

Good night.

You're snoring!

How has this happened?

Don't ask.

What are these numbers
and mysterious signs?

Is to help build the Ark.

-But what do they mean?
-We do not know the code.

I know. Know where each piece
wood fits.

When he learned this, father?

Last night. Muttered, he snorted,
muttered, he snorted, muttered ...

He was learning
How to build the Ark.

Hands to work.

We want food.

Japheth? Take the bread.
We give what we have.

-Want more.
-Don't even know how much give.

How do you want more?

-We always want more.
-Noah!

Noah!

Doesn't recognize me? I'm A Lot.

-Your old friend! Of Sodom.
-Lot! Lot! Mother is the Lot!

Nunca te thanked
for having saved me.

Hello, Lot.

-Where is your wife?
-Dead, deceased, was already.

-I'm sorry.
-The world is like that.

What happened to her?

She always found the salt of the Earth,
and finally it happened.

She became a statue
of salt. Look at her finger.

What are we waiting for?
Let's steal everything, kill them ...

raping women.
Or vice versa.

-You will die trying.
-So what?

-Cannot be worse than living.
-Rufus, they are my friends.

If you have disgust,
We kill for you.

No, Rufus,
I don't care about killing.

This I did not expect.

I was mistaken.
You caught me off guard.

I want to tell you something
on my last breath.

-What is it?
-É...

-What?
-É...

-É...
-Yes?

You took too long, Rufus.
Carry-in, guys.

The boots are mine.

Lot?

Why become
a killer?

For a living.

The Lord has saved you
instead of others.

Thank you, Noah.

Yes, He saved me.

But I got no job, money.
It would be better I have died in Sodom!

Because being poor is like being dead,
just that you breathe.

Not. I tried to take a correct life,
but I was starving.

And, like everyone else,
disgusted by being poor.

You were a decent man.
If is now so ...

and the rest of humanity?

Or want to know.

You are the only decent man
I found that is going well.

The world is beautiful, Noah,
When we continue good.

But nobody can.

And see just how much gloom.

Making a new House?

Is an Ark.

-A boat.
-Boat?

-The Lord.
-The Lord.

All call you crazy
because the hear. But I know.

You are the only man are
What remained. Know ...

I also would love it if It
do not make the rules so strict!

I confirm.
He is really Almighty!

Right, let's get ready.
Let's go!

Mount! Prepare! Naama!

Shem, Ham, Japheth!
Good luck. Noah?

It was good to review it. The next
time to talk with the Lord ...

Thank you for saving me. AND ...

say that I regret not having been
worthy of salvation.

We will though.
Let's go. Let's go.

Wake Up, Noah. You are
sleepwalker. Yes, there she is.

Saw?

Admire. The Ark.

-The Lord is over!
-Yes.

-The time has come.
-What, Sir?

Sodom and Gomorrah was an alert,
but they haven't changed.

Now, instead of fire and brimstone ...

afogarei the world in my tears.
Weep for 40 days and 40 nights.

I will flood the world,
and nothing will survive!

Oh, no ...

Mr?

I do not understand.

Why when we created
left us free to Sin?

It was some big mistake?

I had hope. I found that
see the difference between good and evil ...

and choose wisely!

I expected it to turn
a nation of prophets.

Pity, Mr.
Give another chance to mankind.

She does not deserve to be swept
from the face of the Earth.

Whatever they did ...

The sins of mankind
are too big.

-There is nothing ...?
-They started to hate.

And now they all hate.
Are destroying the world again.

I'll finish with everything
and start again.

The Lord did not finish
the service, father.

There is no rudder.

Every boat has to have
a rudder, isn't it?

God said that the Ark
should not have.

He wants to guide us on the waters.
Let's wander ... here and there.

Here and there.

Heard, manos?

We'll wander
here and there.

Here and there!

Here and there?

No joke.
Get back to work.

-Dad, why the Ark is so great?
-We'll have company.

Animals Creepers.

Someone we know?

Animals. Many animals.

God is choosing them now.

What a beautiful dirt they'll do!

Who will catch everything?

Certainly, you have not thought
about it when he had this idea!

It picks a couple of each
species. They are already on the way.

Noah, the end of the world
starts tomorrow.

I inundarei the whole earth,
washing the sins forever.

Was Noah who did stop raining!

And it was Noah who brought the animals!

Kills! Kills! Kills! Kills!

Who brought all this?

The dad must have spoken
'' up there ''.

He lives saying
that the Lord will provide.

I see that he also
provided the shovels.

Noah! Noah! Let's kill him!

We'll kill him!

Kill him!

Cam! No, where is the father?

Father?

-I know! Noah is behind this!
-Kill him!

-What's the problem?
-Their animals have passed through the village!

They have not gone '' by '',
they spent '' about ''.

We regret.
My husband will speak with them.

They trampled everything,
and we pisotearemos you!

Ora! Who's afraid
a tiger a rod?

But two lions sarnentos?

It is not fair to bring
the animals here ...

destroying our homes,
fields and crops!

-That the plantation?
-I do not understand.

-What these critters are here?
-They go to the Ark.

Are all madmen!
The animals too!

They know that they will be saved
When the rain comes.

That rain? It doesn't rain for years!

Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

-She's coming.
-There is not a cloud!

Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

Where's the rain?

She didn't wet!
She burns like fire!

Is burning me!

She burns ...

Is burning me!

Noah? When God makes it rain,
as he knows how much should last?

He knows.
It will last for 40 days and 40 nights.

So, we need to
be ready to leave.

Think '' sail ''
is the expression.

Let's take someone more, father?

I spoke with the Lord ...

and we'll only take
Thompson, Ruth and Esther.

-Nobody else!
-I liked it!

-Fast! Pick up girls!
-Hurry! Let's go!

-I will not without my mother!
-I wanted to, but my dad said no.

Damn you your father and you!

-We go from now!
-I'll stay!

-Take it, Cam!
-I won't!

Anda!

Fast!

What happened?

What happened to you?

Without! Without!

Help me!

Ruth! Ruth!

Let's lift. Lift!

Hold it.

-Can leave.
-You are late!

I know.

Raise the ramp, guys!

Lord, is this the end?

Is not even the beginning of the end.

For more that has learned,
This is still the first page!

The flood is not yet strong
enough to flood the world ...

and do you see the strength
God Almighty!

Drug!

No More!

Japheth always had problem
with the work.

How does not work,
He does not know when to stop.

Japheth! Come here to help us.

Let's go!

-I hate dirty work.
-Is, and this is dirty.

It was for this that the Lord
saved us?

Clean?

I got scared.

With the door locked,
could not enter.

Not?

I speak of the storm.

-Where the girls are?
-Cooking.

As they passed the night?

No I thought comfort
Ruth last night.

I thought the same about Mani,
but the door was locked.

The work of father.

Hello, Ginger.

Hello.

-Find me on deck tonight.
-His father was not going to like it.

If he doesn't know,
will not be hurt.

He would not like, nor do I!

No!

And the Fox lay down
with the lamb.

Hopefully she doesn't want to
Lamb for dinner.

See how are affectionate
with one another.

Why God does not make another land,
with other people ...

If he does not like this?

If we had hair ...

as the critters,
instead of skin ...

... wouldn't have to wear clothes.
-Wouldn't have to wear clothes.

Hello!

Father! Mom!

-Hello!
-Hello.

-Ruth!
-Hello!

-Hello!
-Hello!

-Hello!
-Hello!

What a beautiful boat that yours!

Yes, Yes. He is.

Need something?
Pots, pans, knives sharp.

Dresses for the ladies.
And has the offer of the week ...

The Wonderful Elixir Marigold.

We have already seen before, Muscat!

-Already?
-We met.

And we bought Cookware.
And hats. Remember?

Hats.
For the whole family.

Ora! Another satisfied customer.

With me, your money
will always be well spent ...

my products have
lifetime warranty.

I will ascend the Board, if you will allow me.
Only for the purpose of Exchange.

Stay where you are.
We'll go down.

Give It A Try.

A SIP, and become
in a new man.

Maybe two new men.

-Good, huh!
-Smooth.

IS ...

strictly medicinal?

Oh, of course!
Strictly, no doubt!

Go by me:
take a couple of boxes.

What I would like in return?
We don't have any money.

No one has. Is useless.

This shows the State they arrived
things currently.

The money lost its value.
Is horrible. Horrible.

Before, the money
define who we were.

I was ...
I was a merchant.

Now do I ... bartering.
Change one thing for another.

-That decadence!
-What do you want in place of money?

Food! Water!

Has a lot of water out there,
only that is getting salty.

Food and drinking water.

Closed.

Percy, for you have nothing!

I'll find one thing
for our little friend.

Very well.

-Picked up everything?
-Already got everything?

Careful not to fall into the water.

Goodbye.

-Thanks, Muscat.
-Take care!

-Up to see.
-Right!

-Goodbye.
-Good sales!

Take care!

-Goodbye!
-Thank you.

Goodbye!

We will have difficulty
to keep them at Bay.

Is natural.

Natural or not, God imposed
certain rules for this trip.

One of them is: no sex
or procreation ...

among animals or humans.

As we go
control animals?

We do not need. God took care of that,
eliminating the instinct of them.

And our instincts?

We'll have to control them ...

by the way.

God created us, then he should
know that it will not be easy.

We have to take care of them,
Dear.

Of the boys?

But ...

and we? How are ...

How are our instincts?

We are mature enough to
control them when necessary.

And I think it will be.

-What are you drinking?
-Wonderful Elixir Marigold.

Strictly medicinal.

This trip will be long?

Too long.

Wow life!

Attack!

-Why the rush?
-It took my daughter.

She is all I have in the world
now that his holy mother is gone!

Moreover, look at the size of it!

With this boat, we will dominate
the rest of the world! Attack!

The captain will not like.

I don't care what that
Junk of people like!

-Leave it to me!
-Call the captain!

Attack!

Prepare yourselves!

Maybe they are peaceful.

Kill him!
Kill it already!

Stop it!

I always took it all!

This I could have won!

Attack.

Attack ...

It Takes!

What they want?

Noah! Is Lot!
His old friend Lot!

-Lot?
-He joined the rabble.

Naama is talking bad about me?

More or less.

She nailed it! I progressed
a lot since Sodom.

Was a total decay,
and I loved every minute!

I'll take your boat, Noah.

Why?

So when you ask me
What did the flood, I will say:

'' I survived! ''

This boat is ours!

It belongs to the village!
You stole.

-We build!
-Truth! We build.

-And he stole!
-Your thief!

Surrender yourself, Noah, and nobody
will hurt, I promise.

The Lord will not allow.

So risk, old friend.

In that case ...

do your worst.

Take the boat!

Leave the front! Outside!

Give me that! Get Out!

Climb here!

Take all! Pick Up!

What is shooting?

The buns I did yesterday.

I'm sore!

Not over, Noah!

We have to live.

We will stir up the animals.
Use fire!

Fire!

Fire!

Fire!

Fire!

Fire, brothers!

The army of the Lord
is on our side!

Fast!

Mr?

Mr?

God!

Left someone ...

Besides us, Sir?

Anyone?

It will be so difficult!

Destroy humanity as well
It has not been easy for me.

If humanity
It's so bad, Mr ...

Why not populated
the world with Angels?

The problem of the Angels is that,
Although they decay ...

they are not perfect.
Humans, however ...

can decay ...

Yes, but they enhance.
Only it didn't.

I won't make the same mistake
again. So, maybe I do ...

... a total cleaning.
-lnclusive us?

I'm afraid so.

But, Lord, I follow
with my heart and my soul.

At least save Naama and young people.

Take me, Lord. Take me.

To me, it's all or nothing, Noah.

It is not fair.
-Not always the life is.

But I haven't decided.
I'll reflect carefully.

I'll be unavailable
for a while.

And we will be ...

Alone. Will have to go
so without me.

Mr?

Mr!

Come here!

Tell me yourself
something in this fog.

We cannot divert?

We Could,
If we had the Government.

But, to have Government, we need
have a rudder, and we do not have.

Hate this silence!

-Hello!
-Hello!

-Hello!
-Hello!

In recent weeks,
I have had a horrible thought.

I have hundreds.

I think we are
walking in circles.

How can you find it?
Everything looks the same!

-So where are we?
-Up the river without a rudder.

If we had markers!

What about this?

If we look at this again, we will know
We're giving away rounds.

We should have a rudder.
We are going in circles.

-Daddy know I'm smart.
-I also know.

Remember the time you wanted to convince you
the buy me a dress ...

and you almost convinced me
taking what I wore?

I wanted to have a conversation
serious, can it be?

Daddy should hear me.

But he only listens to God.

What do you think?

-You do not need to do this.
-I believe in sharing task.

I wanted to share another thing.

Look!

Saw what you made me do?
Could you have fallen!

No, look!

-Look!
-There! Over there!

Noah, Noah? Look!

We arrived on Earth!

That beautiful!

Is the paradise!

That dirty cheating
cheat as well!

Maybe it's some joke.

Nobody laughed.

It was horrible to make us feel
We had arrived at Earth.

My back.

Is this water.
Soak your bones.

The young people were bored.
You should try to cheer them.

Cheer them as?
With music and dancing?

-Some juggling?
-Why not?

You know to be funny.
In the latest Gale, you said ...

that got so much that was
taking the lists of zebras.

This was good.

-They do not know that your side.
-I am the captain.

Must have a severe air.
Especially now ...

the Lord walks out.

Naama?

Do you believe in the Lord?

Yes.

He saved us. But, sometimes,
I wonder why.

And our children?

-Believe In Him?
-I hope so.

But, if you do not believe,
just because you believe.

You have not answered
to my question.

That question, dear?

God was thinking about what?

If we destroy or not.

Cam! Without!

Come!

What is that?

-Another mirage. Is the Sun.
-But it's cloudy!

May be someone
calling our attention.

-Ali! There! There!
-What? What is it?

There!

Who played my drink
in the sea?

We, father.

Weeks ago.

Thanks to his stupidity,
We are going in circles!

In circles!

What are you doing?

What should have done since
the beginning! A rudder!

Fixarei this mast at the door.

-We will help you.
-His father will not allow.

We will not be going round
the rest of your life!

Has reason.

Without rudder!

I'm wet.

Should be ashamed, Noah,
fighting as a brat!

He would build a rudder,
contrary to the Lord!

Lord, long ago
not talking.

But there is no reason
for us to forget.

My children are challenging
my authority.

And that means your authority.
I can't afford.

But it is hard. I understand
Why are they against me.

We don't progress,
just give laps. We are fools!

There is a deeper purpose?

Talk to me, Mr. Say something.

Even though it is goodbye.

-I'm a dreamer.
-Only you?

So the common people
love us.

We take a bit of joy
grey to their lives.

If I cram my nose so ...

I'll be with double chin
in the neck?

Are getting crazy.

Have to wake up early
to deceive me.

Yes, at noon.

The only thing that sticks
at their head is hair.

Not know how to count up to twenty
without taking off your shoes!

You need to stay out of each other
to get an idea.

If you don't respect me,
I devour you.

If you had more judgement,
would already be an asshole.

Children, we are here
to clarify some things.

Her father wants
say a few words.

I thought in my
old friend.

If he were alive today,
It would be very rich. Don't make noise.

Noah, what was?

I feel like if you tried to run
with legs tied.

What do you think, Japheth?

-Nothing.
-So it was good.

I think that would not live without you,
but just think.

Noah, my well
you are beside themselves.

So, who am I?
Don't make noise!

-Best you rest.
-Drop the keel ...

Download the candle and stand clamp
principal. All on deck!

I'm going to establish the dividing line.
It's up here, and ready!

The sky!

Is bleeding!

Is bleeding!

I won! I won!
Crown me with leaves!

-Put sauerkraut on my hair!
-I'll take care of it.

Guys, you take care of the Ark.

Cam, you're the oldest.
Will be responsible.

I will not disappoint her.

Have a boat to operate.

Has a young man at helm station now.

New blood.
new ldéias.

-Lead us! We are with the Lord.
-Exact! Has our support.

-Take us home, Captain!
-We will not be more without rudders.

-Arrives to wander aimlessly.
-steady! He is our man!

-Sail for home!
-Take us, Lord. Is our captain.

Is our leader.

The orders, Captain.

-At orders!
-Take us home, Captain!

Damn sight!
that is a riot!

Has monsters under the bed.
I will though!

Who burned toadstool?
I will not tolerate!

Silence when talking
with the captain!

Old fool!
No one is listening.

See if it dies!

Your time has passed.
Go eat grass.

You're old!

Rest in peace!

Rest in peace!

Rest in peace!

I'll see you dead, ungrateful children
and daughters of perdition!

I deserdo!

Throw it overboard!

-I'm ready!
-Know recognize a riot!

-Take its carcass of my boat!
-I'm not crazy to think.

Show your strength. Let's go.

Make mincemeat of you.
Come.

Let's go.

The Lord Almighty ...

has 1 .60 m tall.
It is softly! I saw him.

Naama?

-What are you doing?
-I wouldn't call Naama.

I am the Lord's will.

We will, we will, we will ...

everything, everything, everything, everything ... until we
burst, burst, burst.

Mom! You need to rest.

What do I need ...

is two birds and a stone.
And, remember ...

never cry on
the milk protected.

Thank You, Pegasus.

Two legs are not enough
to support a woman like me.

Go to your room now.

What shall we do?

-We'll shoot it.
-With what?

Throw away that damn fruit!

We will, we will, we will
everything, everything, everything that we, we ...

We have to stop this cantoria.
Is horrible!

Naama?

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

-Got it!
-Calm. Calm. Take it down.

No! No! Run!
Attempt to save!

-Put it on the bed.
-Are the little monsters!

Calm. Slowly.

Are the little monsters!

God, we need more
What ever of the Lord!

Still,
left us adrift!

We need a signal.
Give us a sign.

-How's MOM?
-Better.

-But can barely speak.
-Like all of us.

-What shall we do?
-What can we do ...

until the Lord give us a sign?

What about making a rudder?

I'm not so old for not having
learned certain lessons.

I won't stop you,
If you think that will advance.

Will not.

We can go anywhere,
North, South, East or West ...

will make no difference.

There is nothing but water.

We die here.

Ghosts, a Ghost ship.

I asked the Lord
to send us a signal.

Go Search land!

Pronto.
Is already at home again.

Mr? How long
We met?

Enough time
so I can say ...

This is the way to govern
your world?

Dealing with us without mercy
and going crazy?

Tell me, what do I do
This your land?

I silence always
for a good reason.

Is the Lord?

-Yes!
-Long time no talk.

Have you decided what to do
with us, Sir?

It was a tough decision.
I wanted to get a second opinion.

But from whom? I am sorry, Noah.

I decided to end it all.

Came out all wrong from the beginning,
When Adam sinned in paradise.

The men created a world
without salvation, full of blood ...

where good and evil become one.
The Ark, and all aboard her ...

will be sucked by oblivion.

In the end, this is little thing.
Is going through the portal ...

to the paradise.

And so Noah?

No requests for mercy?
Nothing tears? Or cries?

What you're doing, Noah?

Noah?

I am not worthy to offer
my tears. So, I whistle.

Only that.

Whistle?

Whistle ...

Ah, Noah ...

Ah, Noah ...

Noah!

Noah! You was tender
my heart once more.

Spare you and your world.
A last chance, Noah.

-A last chance.
-Thank you, thank you, Sir ...

by Grace granted me.

Tomorrow I'll give you a signal.
Send a bird.

I sent.
I sent a Raven.

Crows are agourentos!
Noah, send a dove.

Will not try the business
the bird again, will you?

The Lord came to us.

-Didn't notice that He had departed.
-He had.

Why we suffer
of madness and despair.

-Keep in despair.
-All of us! I'm not like that.

-I am always very happy.
-Will change. Trust me.

Father, once you gave me
two Councils.

Said: '' never sleep with a woman
more problematic that you. ''

And '' Never trust a man
that say ' trust me '.

I do not remember. But trust me,
as I trust in the Lord God.

Mom?

-Should not have raised.
-I wanted to breathe fresh air.

Feels like, MOM?

I feel much better.

Good. The Lord sent me
drop this Dove ...

to see if it brings some signal.

So don't be talking about.
Drop it.

What do you guys think?

Worse is impossible.

What harm do?

Noah? MOM is right.
Drop it!

Go!

She returned.

She returned!

Ruth!

Father! Father! Everyone!

She returned!

Stay there. Stay there. Cute little bird!
Cute ...

Leave me, leave me.

Will ...

I'd pick. Why do I hurt?
Yes, you hurt me.

Thank You.

I picked it up.

Saw?

She found the Earth.

Look!

Look at it!

They are very happy
to see it well, dear.

Also I missed you.

Isn't it wonderful the Lord
have decided to spare us?

-It will no longer destroy us.
-But of course not.

You seem to have received
the news quietly.

It seems that already knew.

But I knew.

Saw something?

Anything.

Cam, think you have some
something there that there before?

Yes. Hope.

-But has Earth?
-If you have ...

We'll meet.

This is what I always liked you.

So like me
for some reason.

You are always so confident ...

even when it is wrong.

Japheth?

Without!

What is that?

The Lord has saved us,
as said that would save.

We should thank him.
Come. Come.

No, father, there is no time.

Not?

Run!

Run!

-Back! Behind!
-Run! Let's go!

We arrived on Earth.

We arrived on Earth!

We arrived on Earth!

Hello!

Hello!

'' The Lord said:
' Multiply! '' '

Cam? You have something
to tell us?

They want to go.

Doesn't mean we don't love them.
We love.

But it's time to fly the nest.

Is natural.

Were all, father.

-Anybody else?
-Anybody else? Over?

Wake Up!

Hardly any.

I think we let go everyone.

-Empty.
-Not. Waiting.

You almost lost to time!

Will the animals
will continue our friends?

Yes, if we treat as friends.

Your sleepers!

There are no priests or men
of God here, just me.

Then, as captain, celebrate
the wedding ceremony.

How is the ceremony, father?

I don't know, I just ...

Make equal to ours, Noah.

For many years.
Let me see...

I think I remember party
more important.

Great.

Sons and daughters ...

You will behave
with decency and honor?

Will respect one another?

Will love joy ...

and in sorrow?

Yes.

Very well. Over?

I think the Lord
do not oppose this.

Take care of it.

Without.

Will they be OK?

They are young.
Is an adventure.

Noah?

I was ...

thinking of everything
What happened, Mr.

Yes.

There are parts that can be counted
with words ...

other ...

only with silence.

I may have exceeded me.

I am single, eternal, perfect.

But I can fool me.

Don't ask me to explain, Noah.

Saw humanity destroyed,
and I know that this is not the way.

Need of man, as he me.
We have completed.

So, there needs to be a Pact
between us. With one another.

Do not raise my hand ...

Even though the Earth
stay in the hands of the bad guys?

I'll be in silence.
And I will not destroy it.

Thank You, Mr.

Humanity is able to
shredding-if alone, Noah.

She don't need
my help.
