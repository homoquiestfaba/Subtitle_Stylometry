No, I'm sorry.

No, no,

Yes.

It's human nature.
''We'll do this to avoid that.''

This is not the Romans.

There's a company
you did the books for
on Lipowa Street.

Made what ?
Pots and pans ?

By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

A good company,
you think ?
Modestly successful.

I know nothing
about enamelware.
Do you ?

I was just
the accountant.

Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think ?

Change the machines around,
whatever you do,

you could make other
things, couldn't you ?

Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now
it's great.

You can make a fortune,
don't you think ?

I think most people right now
have other priorities.

Like what ?
[ Sighs ]

I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

Oh, well, I can get
the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.

Finding the money
to buy the company,
that's hard.

You don't have
any money ?

Not that kind of money.
You know anybody ?

[ Closes Case ]
Jews, yeah.

Investors. You must
have contacts...

in theJewish
business community
working here.

What community ?
Jews can no longer
own businesses.

That's why this one's
in receivership.
But they
wouldn't own it.

I'd own it.
I'd pay them back in
product-- pots and pans.

Pots and pans.
Something
they can use.

Something they can
feel in their hands.

They can trade it
on the black market,
do whatever they want.

Everybody's happy.

If you want, you could
run the company for me.

Let me understand.

They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do ?

I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

The presentation.

I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

anything in the ghetto.

Did I call
this meeting ?

You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

Fair would be

The standard SS rate for
Jewish skilled labor
is seven marks a day,

five for unskilled
and women.

This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

TheJews themselves
receive nothing.

Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get
a little more.

Are you
listening ?
What was that about the SS ?

The rate ? The what ?

TheJewish worker's salary--
you pay it directly to
the SS, not to the worker.

He gets nothing.
But it's less.

It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.
It's less.

That's the point
I'm trying to make.

Poles cost more.

[ Sniffs ]
Why should I hire Poles ?

An enamelware factory
over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

It, uh, it, um--
It's owned by a German.

But it's outside
the ghetto, so you can
barter for extra goods--

for eggs, I don't know
what you need--

with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the--
I am healthy.

You need to convince them
you have a trade, something
valuable to the war effort.

Like what ?
What if you don't ?
I'm a musician.

Your name goes
on a list.
And they put you on trucks--

No, no, no,
that's not true.
You're a musician ?

<i>Yeah.
I'd find a good

I'm not going to hide
like some animal.
There are places to hide.

Not essential ?
I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

Oskar.

My father, at the height

I've got 3 50.

with one purpose.

To make money.
For me.

Does anyone
ask about me ?

Back home ?
Everybody.

All the time.

Hmm.

They won't soon forget
the name Schindler here,
I can tell you that.

''Oskar Schindler,''
they'll say.

''Everybody
remembers him.

''He did something
extraordinary.

''He did something
no one else did.

''He came here
with nothing--

''a suitcase--

''and built a bankrupt
company into a major

''And left with

Hmm.

It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

You're wrong, Emilie.
[ Kissing Sound ]

There's no way I could have
known this before,

but there was always
something missing.

In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me
that failed.

Something was missing.

Even if I'd known what it
was, there's nothing I could
have done about it...

because you can't
create this thing.

And it makes all
the difference in the world
between success and failure.

Luck ?

War.

Should I stay ?

It's a beautiful city.

I asked you

I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker
for Oskar Schindler.

A one-armed Jew ?
Twice as useless !
Yes, yes.

I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

<i>[ Lowenstein ]
I work for Oskar Schindler.</i>

Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow.
Look at the snow !

[ Gunshot ]

I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

File a grievance
with the Economic Office.
It's your right.

Would it do
any good ?
Of course not.

[ Chuckles ]

A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office
came to lunch...

<i>and he told us that to believe
theJewish skilled worker
had a place...</i>

<i>in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.</i>

A one-armed machinist, Oskar ?

He was
a metal press operator.

Quite skilled.

[ Moaning ]

<i>[ Panting, Moaning ]</i>

<i>Herr Direktor?</i>

Shit.
I don't believe it.

Stern, is that you ?

No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

<i>[ Soldier ]
Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

<i>Clearly label it.</i>

<i>Given name first,
then your surname.</i>

<i>Do not bring
your baggage with you.</i>

It will follow you later.

Leave your luggage
on the platform.

Clearly label it.

<i>[ Loudspeaker ]
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck
am Bahnsteig.</i>

Stern ?

He's on the list.
He is ?

Well, let's find him.
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.

He's on the list.
If he were an essential worker,
he would not be on the list.

I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name ?

Sir, the list
is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list.

I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.

Tauber.

<i>Hauptscharfuehrer,
this gentleman thinks
a mistake's been made.</i>

My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

<i>[ Loudspeaker ]
Achtung, dieser Zug
faehrt jetzt ab.</i>

Is he on the list ?
Yes, sir.
Itzhak Stern.

Well, the list
is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

<i>What is your name ?
[ Loudspeaker ]
Close and secure all doors.</i>

<i>My name ?
My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.</i>

<i>Kunder.
Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.</i>

K-U-N-D-E-R.
And what's yours ?

Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

<i>[ Conductor ]

Stern !
Stern !

Itzhak Stern !

[ Train Whistle Blowing ]

Stern !
Itzhak Stern !

<i>[ Kunder, Tauber ]
Stern.! Stern.!
Itzhak Stern.!</i>

Stern !

Sir ?

<i>Stern !
Herr Direktor.</i>

[ Coughing ]
My apologies.

Stop the train !
He's here !
I apologize.

Stop the train !
Stop the train ! Stop it !

<i>Sign here.
Initial there.
[ Whistle Blowing ]</i>

Makes no difference
to us, you understand.
This one, that one.

<i>[ Train Whistle Blowing ]
It's the inconvenience
to the list.</i>

It's the paperwork.
I somehow left
my work card at home.

I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but--

I'm sorry, it was stupid !
What if I got here
five minutes later ?

Then where would I be ?

<i>Shechel.</i>

<i>Sacrean,
sacrean end tzukeer.</i>

<i>Tzukeer end sacrean.</i>

I woke up from a dream
this morning.

I was broke and sharing a room
with 1 2 people I didn't know,

only to discover
I was broke and sharing a room
with 1 2 people I didn't know.

[ Chuckling ]

You laugh about it ?
I have to laugh.

You are living
behind walls.

<i>The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions
to my life I'm tired of.</i>

<i>Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.</i>

I like it here.
There's a kind of,
I don't know,

ancestral squalor
to it all.

<i>You are a slave
to these people.
No one envies us anymore.</i>

I'm smart.
Oh, yes,
you're smart.

You're
a real genius.
You had your chance.

Today,
today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

I can't remember
the last time I did that.

When's the last time
we did this ?

When's the last time
we stood around and talked ?

No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

No one took my business
away from me.

You don't really have
a business to take.

There's nowhere
down from here.

This is it.
This is the bottom.

The ghetto is... liberty.

This street
divides the ghetto
just about in half.

Right side, Ghetto A:
civil employees,

industrial workers
and so on.

Left side, Ghetto B:
surplus labor,

the elderly
and infirm mostly.

<i>Which is where you'll
want to start, huh ?</i>

<i>Do you have any
questions, sir?</i>

<i>Ja, why is the top down ?
I'm fucking freezing.</i>

[ Wilhelm Kunde ]
We expect a labor force
of 25,000 to 30,000.

Segregated, of course.
The men in the barracks
near the quarry.

The women on the other
side of the wire.

[ Goeth ]
My place is where ?
There, sir.

There ?
You call that a villa ?
Yes, the villa.

Their synagogue,
can you see it ?
That's not a villa.

We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.
It's a house.

[ Goeth ]
What's that over there ?

[ Kunde ]
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

And we have
a dentist, shoemaker,
practical physicians.

[ Guard ]
There they are, sir.

[ Goeth Sniffs ]
Hmm.

One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

There is an opening
for a job,

away from all this...
backbreaking work,

at my new villa.
[ Sniffs ]

Uh, which of you has...

domestic experience ?

<i>Ja, on second thought,
I don't really want
someone else's maid.</i>

All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

[ Chuckles ]
I don't want
to give you my cold.

Uh, what's your name ?

Helen Hirsch.
What ?

[ Coughing ]
Helen Hirsch.

What ?
I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.

<i>Ja.
[ Woman ]
Take it all down.!</i>

<i>[ Officer Blows Whistle ]
To work.!</i>

<i>[ Woman Arguing ]
Take it down.!
It is not safe.!</i>

She says
the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.

I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch !

<i>Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...</i>

has to be torn down
and repoured.

If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

at the southern end
of the barracks.

Subsidence,
and then collapse.

And you are
an engineer ?
Yes.

My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

<i>Unterscharfuehrer.!
Jawohl?</i>

Shoot her.
What ?

<i>[ Gasps ]
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.</i>

<i>Ja, I'm doing mine.</i>

But, sir,
she's foreman
of construction.

We are not going
to have arguments
with these people.

Okay.

No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

<i>It will take
more than that.</i>

<i>[ Goeth ]
I'm sure you're right.</i>

Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

We have more to see,
but we have only one more
hour of light.

** [ Humming ]

<i>[ Goeth ]
Today is history.</i>

<i>Today will be remembered.</i>

Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder...

about this day.

Today is history,
and you are part of it.

Six hundred years ago...

** [ Singing
Morning Prayer]

<i>when elsewhere they were footing
the blame for the Black Death,
Kazimierz the Great, so-called,</i>

<i>*Ke laolam chasedo *
told theJews
they could come to Krakow.</i>

<i>Chaja, bread.
[ Goeth Continues ]
They came.</i>

<i>Not that fat. No, less.
They trundled their belongings
into the city.</i>

<i>Yes, a bit less.
They settled.</i>

<i>They took hold.
They prospered...</i>

<i>in business, science,
education, the arts.</i>

<i>They came here with nothing.</i>

<i>**[ Praying Continues ]
Nothing.</i>

<i>And they flourished.</i>

<i>For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.</i>

<i>Think about that.</i>

<i>By this evening,</i>

<i>those six centuries
are a rumor.</i>

They never happened.

Today is history.

<i>Absitzen und in Zweierreihen

<i>[ Whistle Blowing,

I think we will start...
with Ghetto B.

<i>Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp.!</i>

<i>[ Dogs Barking ]</i>

All right ?
Start from
both sides ?

I would like you
to start there.
The right side ?

The right side, yeah.
And then move around.
Okay.

Yes, you can.
