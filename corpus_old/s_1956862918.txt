{\an8}[Elle] <i>Considering where we left off,</i>

{\an8}<i>I'm guessing
you might have a few questions.</i>

{\an8}<i>Well, from the moment I told Noah...</i>

{\an8}I love you.

{\an8}<i>...till the moment when he finally left,</i>

{\an8}<i>a whole lot of stuff happened.</i>

<i>- Let me bring you up to speed...</i>
[laughs]

{\an8}<i>As soon as school ended,
the Flynns opened up their beach house.</i>

{\an8}<i>Noah and I spent the whole summer there.</i>

{\an8}Oh, my gosh!

{\an8}<i>- Got an awesome gift...</i>
[shouting]

{\an8}<i>Played board games
till three in the morning.</i>

{\an8}<i>Made sparks fly. This time on the beach.</i>

{\an8}<i>Said hi to an old friend,
watched a gorgeous sunset...</i>

{\an8}[bird squawks]

{\an8}<i>...watched Noah sleep,</i>

{\an8}<i>-watched Noah try to rollerblade,</i>
-[laughing]

{\an8}<i>watched the sun come up
in my favorite way,</i>

<i>and then, just like that,</i>

<i>exactly 27 days ago, my heart flew away.</i>

{\an8}<i>After Noah left, it was hard.</i>

{\an8}<i>He said he wanted
to make long-distance work,</i>

{\an8}<i>but I decided to be a grown-up
about things and to give Noah his space.</i>

<i>I guess that's the kind of maturity
that comes from being a senior.</i>

<i>In other words, I was okay.</i>

{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, I did everything I could
to keep my mind off the fact</i>

{\an8}- [sighs]
<i>- That Noah was 3,000 miles away.</i>

<i>Like I started working
on my college essay,</i>

{\an8}<i>started a podcast
about video games with Lee.</i>

{\an8}- [both] <i>Game On!</i>
[Elle]<i> Already got subscribers,</i>

{\an8}<i>- thank you very much.</i>
Foreign Danger!

{\an8}<i>And finally dominated
my nemesis on Xbox...</i>


<i>Watched Ultimate Frisbee
at the beach house,</i>

{\an8}<i>watched '80s movies with Lee and Rachel,</i>

{\an8}<i>watched Lee fall completely in love,</i>

{\an8}<i>-watched Lee get a super buff bod,</i>
-Ooh!

{\an8}<i>Watched girls watching
Lee's super buff bod,</i>

{\an8}<i>applied for a passport,
applied for a credit card,</i>

{\an8}<i>even applied with Lee
to our dream college.</i>

<i>Rule number 19: always go
to the same school as your bestie.</i>

{\an8}<i>And for us, when it comes to college,</i>

{\an8}<i>that means
the University of California at Berkeley.</i>

{\an8}<i>UC Berkeley is this totally dope,</i>

{\an8}<i>completely amazing school
in Northern California.</i>

{\an8}<i>Lee and I have dreamed of going there</i>

{\an8}<i>ever since we found out
that's where our moms became besties.</i>

{\an8}<i>It has a really cool tower,
hill rolling for good luck,</i>

{\an8}<i>famous Insta squirrels,
and a cool meme page.</i>

<i>This one's for you, Mom.</i>

{\an8}[shouting]

{\an8}<i>Took Brad to the arcade,
took Lee and Rachel hiking,</i>

{\an8}<i>-took a naughty photo for Noah,</i>
-[camera shutter clicks]

{\an8}<i>chickened out about sending it though.</i>

<i>And the last thing I took was
one final moment all to myself.</i>

{\an8}<i>By the end of the summer,</i>

{\an8}<i>I was feeling pretty sorted out
about things with Noah.</i>

<i>He was where he was supposed to be,
and I was where I was supposed to be.</i>

<i>And if it works out for us, great!</i>

<i>But if not, that would be okay too.</i>

[sighs]
<i>Like I said, I was okay...</i>

<i>mostly.</i>

{\an8}<i>And here I am
getting ready for my first day of school,</i>

<i>and everything seems... different somehow.</i>

[horn honks]

["More" by the Eiffels playing]

[horn continues honking]


Last first day! I gotta go.

Mmm! Love you. Love you.

Love you more.
All right, I'm gonna...

[horn honks]
[Elle shouting]


What up?

[both whooping]

Oh, what is this?

Open it.

Okay!


Very funny.

Oh, what can I say?

I thought you might need a pair
of those back-up back-ups this time.


You should try those on, though.
I think they would look quite slimming.

[Elle shouts]

<i>â™ª Maybe we can be more... â™ª</i>

Hey, uh... where are you...
Where are you going? School's that way.

Going to get Rachel.

Oh. Gotcha.

<i>â™ª Maybe we can be more... â™ª</i>

What's up, foxy lady?

Yeah, right. As if.


Oh, okay.

Let's do it, y'all.

What?

I'm just thinking
about how insanely lucky I am.


Let's go! Senior year!
[all shouting]

[Lee shouts]

<i>â™ª Maybe we can, hey! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Maybe we can be more
We could be more â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]

Hey!

[indistinct whispering]



[phone chimes]

What is going on?
I have no idea...

<i>about senior year.</i>

<i>That is until
everybody was looking at me</i>

[gasps]
<i>- Like my dog just died.</i>

[Tuppen] Hey, Elle.
Hey, Tuppen.

Just heard about you and Noah breaking up.

I was really hoping...
No, we didn't break up.

I'm sorry. I thought you guys were
really great together.

I just...
That's not... We didn't... um...

[Tuppen] Was it your decision or his?
[sighs] Never mind.

[Elle] <i>Ugh! Sometimes I hate high school.</i>
[bell rings]

<i>Los Angeles Country Day.</i>

<i>We hope you all had
the very best of summers</i>

and are ready
for another outstanding school year.

Any clubs wanting to present
fall fundraiser ideas to student council

<i>must do so today at three p.m. sharp.</i>
[gasps] We forgot about the presentation

for the kissing booth!

Oh, my God.
Get busy!

And our quote of the day:

<i>"The best thing
to hold on to in life is each other."</i>

[cell phone dings]

Beautiful words from an iconic film star,
Audrey Hepburn.


Have a fantastic day.Â [laughs]


let's all take out
our summer reading material.

That was so good. I was so surprised.
[groans]

{\an8}[laughing]

Oh, and here we go.

Oh, my God, Ellen, how are you?

So many beautiful girls at Harvard.

Experienced girls.
And long distance is tough.

Totally explains why you guys aren't
posting on social anymore.

Oh, actually Noah and I decided
to keep it low-key on social,

so we wouldn't feel pressured by it.

That is so smart. Breakups are brutal.

So brutal.

We didn't break up, though.

With different zip codes,
breakups are basically automatic.

Automatic.
Oh, well. Gotta go.

I wanna take a peek at the new snack
that just transferred in.

Saw him in homeroom. His name's Marco,
and he is seriously luscious.

Ooh! I'm sorry about you and Flynn.

Um, okay.

Thanks. Bye.

[girls chattering indistinctly]

[phone vibrates]


Elle Evans, there's aÂ phone call for you
in the office.

It's your father.

He said it's urgent.

The phone's over there, honey.
Okay.

Gosh. I hope it's nothing too serious.
Hello?

What's going on with you?

What? Uh...


Why aren't you texting me back?

Well... what?

Um... oh, my God!

That's horrible, horrible news
about Aunt, um...

Rose.

Is everything okay?

No.
Uh...

Could I please have a moment in private?
Sure.

Just give me a second.

I'm stepping into the office
to take a second to process this.

Why are you pretending to be my dad?

It was the only way I could think
to get you on the phone.

Oh, that is not true.


No, it is true.
You barely call, and when you text,

you send
these weird two-word text messages

like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon."
[sighs]

Are you breaking up with me?

What? No, no, no, no! The opposite.

Then what? Why?
Why are you ignoring me?

I... I don't know, I...

I guess I'm just...

I'm trying to be mature and not come off
like some clingy girlfriend.

Elle, I told you
that I wanted to make this work.

I know, but people always say that
when they leave.

I just wanted to give you space

so that you could figure out
if this is really what you want.

Space. Space. I don't...
I don't want space.

<i>Space is not what I want, I told you.</i>

I don't want space. I want you.

I want you around me all the time.

I want you with me right now, actually.

I just... I just want you, okay?
[chuckles]

Text me, call me,

send me a messenger pigeon,
whatever it is, okay?

Whatever it is,
just don't give me space, okay?

Okay.

Okay.

[clears throat]
First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited
about this year's fundraiser

and the opportunity before us.

Based on the earnings from last year,
we believe that it would be beneficial...

Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing
a kissing booth again for the fundraiser,

please signify by saying "Aye."
[all] Aye.

[all] Aye.
All those against, say "Nay."

Nay.

Wait, no, I don't actually know
why I just said that.

Let the record show the Ayes have it.

The kissing booth is approved.

[cheering]
[laughing]

Whoo!

And now that that's settled,
what we're all actually curious about is

who you've selected
for the lineup of kissers this time.

Because without Flynn as a headliner
to draw in business,

the booth may not do so well this year.

Uh, that's a good point.
Last year is gonna be hard to top.

We...
So hard.

Quite true. Thoughts?

Well, actually,
the thoughts we're having...

Right. Right.
That's a good point. Great point.

Well, you know, we have decided to keep
this year's list a secret. Yeah.

But do not worry because I know
who a lot of you are already thinking of,

and the answer is yes.

They will be there.

[all cheering]

Whoo! Thank you!

So, we didn't actually get anyone yet,
did we?

That is correct, yes.
Okay.

[Noah] <i>So how's Aunt Rose?</i>
Oh, come on.

You can stop smirking now.
[laughs]

I miss you, jerk.

I miss you more.

So, you Big Man on Campus yet?


It's kinda different here.

What do you mean?

Well, uh...

What's wrong?

Nothing! No, nothing's wrong.
Just... doesn't matter.


I'm... I'm fine. I'm... seriously,
I'm fine. It's just, you know...

What about you? How about you?
Have you applied to any more schools?

Don't even get me started on Berkeley!

If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm...

Don't tell me you've only applied
to one school, Elle.

I know,

but it's literally the only school
we've ever talked about going to.

Well...

you know what you could do?

[Elle] <i>My God. Is he about to ask me to...</i>
Apply here.


that you could apply to in Boston.

<i>And your point being that at leastÂ one
of them would accept my sorry ass?</i>

that if you don't get into Berkeley...

maybe you can come to school here.

<i>With me.</i>

I'd like that.

<i>but my heart just did a backflip.</i>

Um...

Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that.

Maybe you'll think about it.

<i>- Okay, you can just think about it.</i>
[chuckles]

<i>You know, all the books you have to read
if you go here, seriously...</i>

[Elle sighs] <i>I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>about rule number 19,</i>

<i>but here's the thing.</i>

<i>Who knows if I'dÂ even get accepted
into a Boston school?</i>

<i>And if I didn't,</i>

<i>what would be the point in telling Lee now
and getting him upset over nothing?</i>

<i>Right?</i>


great test scores, soccer, Dance Club.

And I also have a podcast
about video games.

Oh! So you're an influencer.

How many subscribers?

Thirty-seven.

Thirty-seven thousand!

We can work with that.
No, no, no, um...

Thirty-seven.


Oh. Well, uh...Â [clears throat]

To get into top-tier colleges
like UC Berkeley and Harvard,

you really need to wow them
with your personal essay.

And yours is...

How shall I put this?Â [snores]

Really? I thought I killed it.
Hmm? What? No.

You didn't even wound it.


Apparently it sucks.

Oh! New level!
[video game music playing]

Wonder if mine sucks.
I should probably look into that.

Don't want that keeping usÂ out
of Berkeley.

Um, yeah. Definitely.

So, have you seen the new kid Marco yet?

Yeah. Devastatingly handsome.

Some are even saying
he's hotter than Noah.

Really? What?
Yeah.

That's crazy!

[beeping]
Oh, Lee! New level, Lee!

Lee? Lee! No! Lee!
[game beeps]

We discussed this.
I need a regular feeding regimen

during my hands-free
<i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> experience.

What the hell is that?

Top score is "MVP"?

"Most Valuable Player"? Well,
somebody thinks highly of themselves.

I kind of always just figured
we'd be number one forever.

Look at me.

We are going to need slushies, churros
and an ass-load of quarters.


[man chatters]
[all] Surprise!

[party favors honk]


Hey, Evans. Come here.

What's up?

That new guy Marco, someone snagged
a video of him working out.

[scoffs] Oh, come on.
[feedback whining]

How hot can this guy actually be?

He can't be that hot.


[laughs]
He's just a guy... whoa! Sweet mercy!

Jeez! Hello!

God! The OMGs were right!

<i>- This guy is a snack indeed!</i>
[all laughing]

Maybe anÂ entrÃ©e!
Maybe he's also the dessert too!

Tell me more!

No, no, no.

Maybe he's the after-after dessert!
He's a big meal that we're having now!

[Lee] Oh, shit! Sorry.
[grunts]

[girl] Oh!!
Sorry about that. Whoa! Oh!

He could bench you,
us together at the same time!

Yeah, definitely.

Whoa!

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah,
Do you want some of this... â™ª</i>

I'm confused. DoÂ I need glasses?

Am I looking at a tray of ice cubes
or a six-pack?

<i>- Am I right? It's incredible!</i>
Shit!

It's like his sweat produces
its own glitter!


<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I get a yeah... â™ª</i>


<i>to the gun show, please?</i>

Because are those arms or cannons?

<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
[laughing]

It's not funny, everybody!
Whoa!


<i>â™ª Do you want some of this... â™ª</i>

-If those abs had Instagram,
-[both laugh]

one million followers all day!
Wow!

[laughing]
[grunts, groans]

I'm not really a butt person,

<i>but, like, now I understand
people who are!</i>

I don't know whether to lick it,
smack it, bite it...

Bite it? Ugh!
I wanna do all three of those things.

Oof! Oh!

Dude, I'm so sorry.

Just call me an earthquake,
because I am legit shook right now!

Whoa!

What is his name again?



Marco! Marco!

Marco.
Marco.

Lee?

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it â™ª</i>

[grunts, sighs]
[feedback whines]

Oh, my God!
[gasps]


You're cool.



Hello, Miss Evans.

Happy birthday!
[bell rings]


[cheering, laughing]
Baby, baby!

Gosh! [groans]

I bet everybody forgets by tomorrow.

Well, that doesn't matter

because I'm still transferring
to a school on the moon.


I'm sorry. Was my description
not vivid enough?

I literally described
a hundred different waysÂ Marco can get it!

[both laugh]


I take itÂ you're the one
from the intercom?

Mm-hmm, yeah.

But they're, you know, already calling me
the Get it Girl, but I go by Elle.

I don't know.
Get it Girl has a nice ring to it.

Cool.

So is that, like, your thing?

Carry around a guitar and remind girls
of horrible moments in their life?

I... I didn't mean it like that.

To be honest, everyone was yelling
and cheering so loud, I could barely hear

what you were saying.
That is great news.

Don't be embarrassed.

Embarrassed?

Get a load of this guy!

I am not embarrassed. No, no, no. I...

<i>You </i>should be embarrassed. That's right.

And I should be apologizing to you
for your embarrassment.

Well, I wasn't embarrassed either.

That's a relief, for me, even though
you said you couldn't hear anything.

Exactly.
So, yeah.

Anyway, nice to meet you,
but I'm a little hungry, so...

I'm gonna go get myself a <i>snack.</i>

[Lee laughs]



Damn it.


What's going on over there?


It looks like you got nominated
for Homecoming King.

What?

Who the hell put your name on the ballot?

I did.

[Tuppen] Nice work, Tiny Flynn.
[Elle] Oh, you look so cute!

Hey, pretty lady!
Hey. Oh, I'm glad you're here.

A package arrived today
with your name on it from Boston.

What? Oh, my gosh!


Oh, I love it!

Ooh, there's a card!

[Elle chuckles]

<i>to keep you warm for your trip to Boston.</i>

<i>If you're up for it.</i>

Wait, what?

Oh, my God, it's a ticket to Boston!

You're gonna love it there!
Oh!

So, can you make it?

Ta-da!
[laughs]

So, my answer is a firm yes!Â [laughs]

Yeah, okay.
I think that's the responsible choice.

Well, I guess you're right,
because how else would I be able

to do all my college interviews?
Wait, you're applying to schools here?

I already sent out applications
to Boston University,

Tufts, Boston College...

And Harvard?

Yes, and Harvard.

[man] Noah, come on!
Brilliant!

We're going.
[clamoring]

Shit, I'm so sorry. I forgot, I've got
some karaoke today. Gotta get ready.

<i>Guys, yo, say hello to Elle.</i>

<i>- Oh.</i>
[all]<i> Hi, Elle!</i>

Hi!

<i>- Hello, boys!
Chloe, how are you?</i>


Yes? Oh, my God. Get dressed, naked boy.

<i>Scandalous!</i>


Hey, babe, I'm sorry. This is, uh...
This is great news,

<i>but I gotta go,
so we can talk about this tomorrow?</i>

Okay, sure...

<i>- All right, bye.</i>
I can't wait to meet...

everyone.


<i>I know I'm gonna regret this.</i>

<i>"Chloe Winthrop."</i>

<i>Oh, just your run-of-the-mill,
breathtaking supermodel goddess.</i>

<i>No worries there.</i>

<i>Not sure I even wanna see this...</i>

<i>Holy crap! That's a lot of money.</i>

<i>Oh, boy.</i>

<i>"The best thing to hold on to in life...</i>

<i>is each other."</i>

<i>to hold on to Noah.</i>

Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

Could I talk to you for a second?

Yeah, sure. Shoot.
[sighs]

[inhales, exhales]

Um, it's just about school.

I just want to know how much we, like...
Figure out, what do we, like, have to...

How much money we have for tuition.

Yeah, um...

I kinda think I need to know.

You know, I...

I thought you wanted to go to UC Berkeley.

No, I do, I do. It's just...

you know, I think it's smart to apply
to some backup schools too.

And some of those schools are private.

Mm-hmm.

You know, without some sort
of financial aid and your help,

I'm not so sure we can afford
a more expensive college.

Don't forget I still have to pay
for Brad's school.

Oh... I didn't think of that.

I'm sorry, Elle. You know, if I could...
Look, Dad,

I totally understand. It's not a problem.

Okay.

[sighs]
[Elle] <i>This is definitely a problem.</i>


<i>Please report to the parking lot
to pick your teams.</i>

Let's see... Okay, Ollie...

All right, I am thinking we go
for poundageÂ on this one, right?

Like, Tuppen would just be so...

I feel you,
but can you trust me on this one?

Miles is phenomenal at volleyball.

Student Council President Miles?


Let's go, Evans, come on.
Who's it gonna be?

Trust me.
[coach] Let's go! Come on.

Uh, we're gonna go with Miles!

[coach] Okay, Miles, you're up.
Me?

[Elle and Ollie] Yeah, you.

Whoo! Here's a team shirt, my dude.

Let's do it.
And, Marco, who's it gonna be?

We'll take the big guy.

Whoo! [cackles]

Tuppen. They've got Tuppen.

Good luck, Capt. Evans.

We're fine. We're good.


Elle, your shoe's untied.

What? Oh, thanks.


[Elle] <i>Did I actually just fall for that?</i>
[shouting]

Oh!


[laughing]
One, two, three, toss!


Unh-unh-unh!




What!

Oh, my God! Pull!

[shouting continues]
[boy] Marco Polo!



Pull!
[shouting]

[chattering]
[Marco grunts]

[wolf whistling]
Oh, my gosh!

Whoa!

Oh!
No, focus!

Oh, ho-ho-ho!
[Elle] Focus!

[Elle screams]


Yeah, yeah!

[grunts]
Oh, whoa, whoa!

All right, he's good. Whoo! Let's go!
[cheering]


Yes, yes, yes, yes!



[boy] Come on, Elle!
[grunting]

Need a hand?

Oh! Hell no!

Have it your way.
See you at the finish line!

[boy] You can do it! Come on!
[cheering]

[shouts]
[cheering]

[grunts, gasps]

Oh!
[gasping]





[Elle and Rachel chattering, laughing]


should we maybe go by that place
with the thingy?

Oh, my God! Of course. Rule number 21.

Should we do rule number 2?
[Elle laughs]

But also rule number 4.
But also, hey! Rule number 18!

Exactly! Oh, my God! Exactly!
Whoo!

Hey, you know what?
I think I'll head home.

Really? Is everything okay?

Yeah, I'm just not feeling well.

[Lee] Oh, okay, yeah.
[kisses]

Bye.

Feel better.

Thanks.

Hey, are you guys okay?

Uh, yeah, I... I think so.

I'd better just give her a call later.

Yeah.

You know, Elle,

assuming I'm the dumbest person ever.
You used to never be good at this.

What's the capital of Pennsylvania?

[laughs]
Wait a second.

Is that Marco?

<i>â™ª Tell me all the things
That I wanna hear â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª 'Cause it's true â™ª
â™ª What I like about you... â™ª</i>

Come on.
<i>- â™ª It's what I like about you</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª What I like about you â™ª</i>

[singing in Spanish]


<i>â™ª Hey! â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Hey! Hey! Hey! â™ª</i>

[trills lips] <i>â™ª Hey! â™ª</i>

[crowd cheering]

All right, let's go.

Hey, guys! Hold up!


I'm impressed.
[Marco] Thanks.

What'd you think, Elle?

Oh, you know, my opinion doesn't <i>really</i>
matter. I'm sure you're impressed

with yourself enough for the both of us.
[chuckles] Oh!

Your friend doesn't like me very much.

She's still upset
about losing on Field Day.

Oh!
Anyways,

so, is this how you spend your Fridays?

Just wooing the women of Santa Monica
with your fancy guitar?

Any requests?

Kissing booth...
Know what?

That's a shame that we have made plans.

But we wouldn't wanna pull you away
from your adoring fans,

so we'll see you later, Marco.

Don't do that to me! Come on!Â [mumbles]

I'm not asking Marco to do the booth.

I don't want to.
I'm telling you.

You know, give it a rest, man.
I'm not doing it.

No.

Oh, son of a bitch!

[rock music playing]

<i>â™ª Here it comes again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm losing my mind
In all this commotion â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Round and around
That's the way it goes â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª I got the feeling
That you got the feeling â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Round and around
That's the way it goes â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª I've been believing
That you've got the feeling â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Round and around
That's the way it goes â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª I've got the feeling
That you've got the feeling â™ª</i>


[both sigh loudly]
Come on. Come on, baby.


Ooh! That might do it!

Yes! We still got it!
Whew!

I love the smell of victory!
[sighs]

Oh, my goodness!
Wait! Do I smell?

[sniffs] No, you're good.
Cool.


<i>A way to make a boatload of money</i>

<i>that could help cover the cost
of school in Boston.</i>

<i>The money was real
and could make things easier for Dad,</i>

<i>no matter which school
I ended up getting into.</i>

Wait,
you're not actually thinking we could...

Uh, win the freestyle category?

That's exactly what I'm thinking.

Well, actually,
we are pretty good at this, aren't we?

Pretty good?
We've had the top score for four years.

Ooh-ooh-ooh!
We could even make team T-shirts.

Yes! Team T-shirts! Why not?
Sure! I love it!

But if we're gonna do it,
we have to do thisÂ right, okay?

Training starts tomorrow
at seven a.m. sharp.

Wait. Training?

<i>in five years?"</i>

<i>Is a difficult question to answer</i>

<i>because as soon as I start to figure out
one thing,</i>

<i>something or someone changes
and makes me question everything.</i>

<i>And if I'm not sure what I am right now,</i>

<i>how could I possibly know
what I want to be in five years?</i>

Hey, you!

Hey, I'm sorry.
Some of the guys were over studying.

<i>That's why I didn't call sooner.</i>

No worries.
I'm glad you're making friends out there.

<i>And in two more sleeps,</i>

I get to come see you
and meet all of them.

Yeah, but we don't have to spend
the entire weekend with them though.

No, I want to get to know them.

<i>Well, one of them, at least.</i>

[Elle] Five, six, seven, eight.

and five, six, seven, eight.

And one and two and three and four

and five, six... whoa!
Ugh, sorry!

God! We should take a break!

Come on, I just want
to get in one more hour of practice

before I leave for Boston tomorrow.

to get ready!

Do you think that you're maybe just taking
this, like, a little bit too seriously?

It is serious!


I didn't want to say anything before,
but...


I really need the money for school.

Let's do it.

Oh, God! Look who's here.

Ooh! This is perfect.
We need a headliner for the booth.

No!
Everyone's obsessed with him!

Why?

You promised the hottest kissers.
[huffs]

Like last year, you get him,
everyone else will just fall in line.


Fine.
Come on.Â [grumbles]

[chattering]
[Elle] Hey!

You two do go everywhere together.

Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.

Anyway, uh, I... sorry.

<i>We </i>wanted to, uh, ask you something.

We do this kissing booth
at the Homecoming fundraiser,

and we were wondering if you'd be one
of our kissers this year.

No.

No.

Why no?

I have my reasons.
[Lee] Come on, dude!

It's the most popular booth!

And it'sÂ for charity.

Don't you believe in charity?

I'm standing here talking to you.
Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

That was a good... one.


Okay.

I'll make you a deal.

I'll play you any game here for it.


You win, I do the booth.

I win,

you babysit my sister for free.

Let me talk with my colleague.

[Elle clears throat]

Okay. Fine.

Uh... any game.

<i>And now to set the trap.</i>

Any game except... that one.

No, no, no. I said any game.
Okay, but that one's...

Well, yeah, but that one's so hard.

<i>Bingo!</i>

Okay, all right. Fine.

Your choice.
Sweet!

Oh, my God!
We got him right where we want him!

[Lee sighs] All righty.

{\an8}[both panting]

[Lee] Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

[Lee and Elle hooting]

[Elle] Yes!
Oh, my gosh! Yes!

Is this how you spend your Friday nights?
Conning people on the DDM machine?

See you at the booth, MVP! Oh, and, um...

you can leave the guitar at home.


See ya!

Oh, my gosh, that was crazy!

We got Marco!
<i>- You</i> got Marco.

And we have the OMGs.
Definitely.

And you think Rachel would do it?
Oh, shit! Rachel!

[Elle] What?
[Lee] No, no, no!

No, no, I was supposed to hang out
with Rachel tonight.

I have to leave right now! Bye!
Yeah, go, go!


I was practicing with Elle.

Look, Lee.

I know that Elle is your best friend,
but this has gotta stop.

I mean, ever since Noah left...
She's always around.

Exactly! You gotta say something to her.

I know, and I'm sorry,
but please don't blame her for this, okay?

I'm the one who forgot.

But it's not just tonight.

She's always inviting herself
or just showing up.

She's lonely! I can't tell her
we don't want her hanging out with us.

But you can leave me standing
at the movie theater

for 45 minutes just fine?

Listen, Lee. If you...

if you can't make
your best friend understand

that this relationship is important,

then I don't think we have a relationship.

Rachel, I can't just tell her...
Just figure out your priorities, Lee.

If I'm one of them,
then go and tell Elle that I am.

Good night.

I can't believe she got that mad
about you being late one time.

Well...

it's a little bit more complicated
than that.

[huffs]
You okay?

I'm just a little nervous about Boston.

Don't worry about it.

It's just Noah.

Yeah.

[Lee] I love you.
[grunts]

I love you.
See you when you're back, yeah?

Yep. Bye.
Bye.

<i>since you've seen someone,</i>

<i>you do worry.</i>

<i>You worry you've let your guard down.</i>

<i>You worry they don't miss you.</i>

<i>And if it's been a while,</i>

<i>you even worry you forgot how
to kiss them.</i>

<i>You worry about everything.</i>


<i>But now,</i>

<i>I'm not worried about a damn thing.</i>

[Elle shouts]
Hi!

You ready for Boston?

[Elle] <i>Noah Flynn, you have no idea.</i>

I just keep thinking about how different
my life is right now.

You know what I mean?

And if I even think about my interviews,
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

Elle, stop.

You're gonna blow 'em away. Okay?

Well, thank you, but we'll see about that.

[both chuckle]

Um.. can I be honest real quickly?

Mm-hmm.

Like, later, when we leave here,

I was thinking, like,
if it's okay with you,

I'm going to treat you
like my own personal jungle gym.


Check!





I love this girl.

So, just before we get in there,

these guys are cool,

but they are a little intense.


Okay?
Yes! Come on!

Okay,
that's not what that case was at all.

Oh, Citizens United was a classic example
of judicial activism, right?

[man] True. Correct.
After conservatives bellyached for years

about the liberal Supremes.
[man] Same thing.

You are a hypocrite at its finest.
Told you they were intense!


<i>to meet isn't here.</i>

One word and an acronym!


Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
Look who's here.


[speaking Italian]


She knows virtually everybody in here!

She knows how to work a room.

So I hear you got something special
for us tonight? I'm excited.

Hello, hello, hello!
[man] Hey! How are you?

[Chloe] You look so good! So dashing!
[man laughs] Nice to see you!


So good to see you.
You look beautiful.

Thank you!Â [laughs]

[man] Come, join us!
[man 2] Thanks for answering my call.

So, where were you?
[Chloe] I actually have no excuse,

but I'll make it up to you tonight
on the dance floor.Â [laughs]

Oh, my God. Wait, no, is this Elle?
Yeah.


I have heard so much about you.
Seriously. My God, you're gorgeous.

You...

You're gorgeous. [chuckles]

I love her already.
[both laugh]

Too bad this one here's so ugly,
though, isn't it?

[all laughing]

Oh!
[man] Burn!

But he does do as he's told,
so I keep him around.Â [laughs]

[man] Oh! Oh, Noah.
[Elle] <i>I bet you do.</i>


The sculptor dropped out...

So, I'm in Zimbabwe, ten years old.

My mom was doing a research paper
on the Ndebele tribe,

and we're gliding down the Zambezi River,

and suddenly, we realize we're
in the middle of a mother hippo

and a baby hippo, and suddenly,
this mouth opens up...

[man] Get out of here!
Out of nowhere and bam!

Bit off the front of the boat!
So, the boat starts sinking,

and everyone is swimming to the side,
and my mother's like,

"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, are you okay?"

I open my eyes and I'm like...

[gasps, laughs] "Can we go again?"
[man] No way! You are insane.

All right! Shots! [bangs table]


You know, we actually... we need to go.

No! So early?

No. Elle's got college interviews
tomorrow, so...

Well, in that case,

here's to Elle kicking ass
at her interviews tomorrow.

[man] Let's do it.
To Elle.

[all] To Elle!
[Chloe] You're welcome.

<i>Tell you whose ass I'd like to kick.</i>

Well, Miss Evans,
that seems to be about it.

Thank you for coming in today
to meet with us.

Thank you for having me.
It was a pleasure.

Elle.
Yeah.

Do you mind
if I give you a piece of advice?

I had the feeling that you were searching

for the perfect answer
to a lot of my questions.

You should know that we're less interested
in meeting the person

you think we want you to be

and far more interested in getting to know
the person you really are.

Thank you.

[shower running]

[cell phone chimes]
[sighs]


What's going on?

[zips bag]
Is everything okay?

Gotta get to the airport.

Talk to me. What's up?

If you wanna talk to someone,
just check your phone.

Elle! Elle!


<i>You think it's moving one way,</i>

<i>and suddenly realize it's heading back
in the opposite direction.</i>

<i>So it's difficult to know what you'll want
in five years.</i>

<i>When that curve comes flying at you</i>

<i>and you're not sure
whether you should try to hit it,</i>

<i>catch it, or just step out of the way.</i>

<i>Dad, I just wanted to explore my options,
okay?</i>

Elle, it's not about any of that.

It's about you asking yourself

if you think a relationship
with Noah's gonna last

and if it's worth changingÂ all
of your plans for him.

[Elle sighs]

Do you?

I'm not sure.

[cell phone ringing]


[ringing continues]

Hey.


I figured that we should talk.

Why were you so upset when you left?

Well, um...

I guess I was looking at this whole life
that you have out there without me

<i>and I'm...</i>

I'm definitely not used to seeing you
around all those college girls.

Elle, I told you, Chloe's just a friend.


Okay.

You don't sound convinced.

I wanna believe you.

Well, there's no reason you shouldn't.


If you're telling me
thatnothing has happened...

then I believe you.

Good.

You know I love you.

I love you too.

I'm really glad we talked.

<i>- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?</i>
Okay.

[phone dings]

[phone rings]

Hey.

Oh, hello, handsome.
I'm outside. Buzz me up?


Uh... what is this?
You, my dear,

have been a magnificent bore
since Elle left,

so I'm taking you out for some fun.

I think you're good for me.

Tell me something I don't know.Â [chuckles]

[winces]
Damn it! I'm so sorry, Elle!

That's okay. All right.

I just can't get this!
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

I know you will.
I know how much this means to you.

I hate that I'm letting you down.

Hey, Lee, hey! Look at me.
[sighs]

You have literally been letting me down
your entire life.



So, how was it with Noah?

I think he might be...

<i>I wanted to tell Lee everything
about Noah,</i>

<i>the earring, even my interviews,</i>

<i>but honestly,
I didn't even know where to begin.</i>

It was so fun. Yeah,
we had a really good time. [chuckles]

Okay.
How about Rachel? How's that?

Uh, pretty much the same
as before you left.

I'm sorry. Don't worry, though.

You'll come up with something
to make her come around.

Yeah.

Yeah, I will.

Wanna practice?

Let's do it!
Okay, cool.

And then drop you.
When do I not drop you?

Oh, that's right. Ever.
That part where you don't drop me.

[dance music playing]
Five, six, seven, eight.

five, six, seven, eight.

<i>â™ª You belong out here with me
You belong out here... â™ª</i>

[Lee grunts, wincing]

Oh, my God, are you okay?

Ow!
Whoa! Are you okay?

My ankle!
Let me get you some ice.

Damn it!



How's that feel?

Better.
Okay.

Listen, Elle,
I am so sorry about the competition.

It's okay.

Wait, actually...

you know who could totally replace me?

No, no, no!

Yeah, yes! MVP! Come on! He's perfect!

No!

Don't you still need the money for school?

Yeah, but...

Well, he's better than me,
and we both know it.

With him, you could actually win.


Well, he's not gonna wanna do it.
I'll <i>get </i>him to do it.

There's no way I'm gonna do it.

Why not?

I'm already doing your kissing booth,
which I didn't want to do, and now this?

I'm only asking 'cause of my ankle.

I can't believe she'd want me to do it.
No, she does.

She knows how good you are.

And she really wants you to.
Really?



So what is it?
He'll do it.

What?
He's totally on board.

What did you have to do?
Nothing! He really wanted to.

Really?

There you are.

I'm here.

Great.

First of all, I just wanted to say

thank you for filling in for Lee.

So I thought we could start
with the step patterns.

Yeah, I mean,
I guess we could start there.

What?

Well, I just thought it might be better
to get theÂ choreography down

and then focus on the step accuracy.

Listen, I've watched hours
of these competitions,

and the winners always have
near-perfect footwork.

But in freestyle,
the step accuracy is a given.

It's the choreography
that wins over the judges.

Yeah, exactly, which is why we're
going to start with the step patterns

and then go to choreography, okay?

Okay.

Great.

If that's the way you wanna do it.

<i>- Give it back! Don't, Lee!</i>
[Lee] <i>Sorry. I'm sorry. Vivian!</i>

Give that back!
I'm sorry. Vivian, please, please!

<i>I'm sorry. I just need a second.</i>

Thank you.
[feedback whines]

Hey, Rachel, it's me, Lee. Lee Flynn.

Look, I'm uh...
I am totally getting detention for this,

but it's worth it because I really
just needed to talk to you.

I am so, so sorry
about everything that happened,

I wanted you to know something.

I never told you this before, but...

I love you, Rachel.

And I'm really hoping
that you love me too.

So would you please text me
a smiley face emoji for yes

and a poop emoji for no, please?

[students laughing]

All right, Mr. Flynn. The show's over.

Ahh.
Let's go. Time for detention.

[outgoing message swooshes]

[man] Let's go.
Okay.

Come on. Let's go.

[cell phone dings]
Yes! Whoo-hoo! I got a smiley face!

Yeah! Whoo!
[all cheering]

I got a smiley face! There's no poop!
Ha ha ha!

There's no poop here!Â [shouts]


<i>Guess Lee doesn't tell me everything.</i>

Well, I'm just glad you finally said it.

So, what we talked about,

Elle always being around,

did you speak to her?

Don't worry. I took care of everything.

She will be giving us plenty of space.

[Rachel chuckles]

Oh, my God,
loved your speech yesterday, Lee.

It was hot.

Thank you. I was driven by love.

And Rachel is so sweet.

And you, I'd be devastated.
So devastated!

About what?

You mean you haven't seen the Insta photos
of Flynn's new supermodel?

Bye, Lee.
[Lee laughs]

<i>so stuck in your head,</i>

<i>that there's only one way to get them out.</i>


[cell phone ringing]
[grunts, exhales]

Hey, I'm at the gym. Can I call you back?

Um, I kinda need to talk to you now,

<i>actually.</i>

Okay. What's up?


Um...

part of the reason I was so upset...

<i>when I left Boston</i>

was because I found something
in your room.

Okay, what'd you find?

An earring,

<i>under your bed,</i>

and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe.

Elle, I promise you,

I have absolutely no idea
how an earring got in my room.

That may be so, but... it was there...

Okay, I know what you thought.

All right.
But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay?

I promise you. It could have been there
before I moved in.

It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's.
There's countless reasons.

It's just that knowing your past,
it's hard not to think...

That's not fair. At all.

Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?

No.

Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me.

Please.

<i>to hear Noah talk this way,</i>

<i>and I knew everything for us depended
on what I said next.</i>

All right.

I believe you.

Okay.

I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but...

I'm glad you told me.

<i>where you stand,</i>

<i>sometimes a leap of faith
is the only move you can make.</i>

[dance music playing]

Okay, okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
You're missing all the steps.

How can we fix that?

Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that.
The precision will come.

What we need is something
that'll really blow the judges away.

We can't even get this routine right,

and you want to make it more complicated?
I want to make it more fun!

That's what the audience wants.

Something like this.

[dance music playing]

[Marco grunting]

[gasps]
[Elle] <i>Holy shit!</i>


Oh!


[gasps, sighs]
Busted.

Walking pretty well, aren't we?

I'm sorry. Okay?
You had a better shot with Marco,

and I knew you wouldn't kick me
off the team, so I did it for you.

Are you mad?


Oh, let's go.
Okay.

[winces, laughs]
Oh, shut up! I'll show you a hurt ankle.


It is just fine.
Really?

No. Don't even ask.

Oh! By the way, so I know we were gonna go
as s'mores for the Halloween dance...

I think we have a winner!
[cheering]

But I have a different idea
for our Halloween costume

that I wanted to run by you.

Check my bag.Â [chuckles]


Uh, yeah!

Right?
Oh, my gosh!

Should we do it?
Obviously!

Knew you'd love it,
I know you so frickin' well!

This is a winner.
I knew you'd love it.

[Lee] Love it!
[Elle laughs]

[sighs]
[ringing]


Uh, hi.

Is, uh... is Noah around?

I think he went to a concert.
I guess he left his phone here.

Oh, um...

Any idea who he might have gone with?

I think he went with Chloe.

Oh. Uh...

okay, uh, thanks.

<i>All right. Bye.</i>

[dance music playing]


Seriously?

What is the big deal?

Oh, my God! The big deal is that
the competition is literally in four weeks

and the routine is a complete nightmare!
I think you're exaggerating.

No, listen, if you don't want to take this
seriously, we shouldÂ just call it off.

Okay, time out.

So I'm using every free hour I have,

practicing into the night
for this competition

that you asked me to help you with,

just so I could screw things up for you?

No.

No, I'm sorry.

I'm just kinda going through some stuff
right now.

Look, you have to trust me.

If we can't have fun, it's gonna show
in our scores with the judges.

I'm having fun.

Sure about that?

Watch yourself. I recorded us.

[dance music playing]
[Marco] Here.

Oh, my God.

You're just thinking too much.
[sighs]

You just gotta let go, feel the music.

Why did you and Lee start doing this
in the first place?


'Cause it was fun.


I'm sorry I've been giving you
so much shit.

Ah, it's okay.

I'm starting to think I really need
to work on my footwork.

[laughing] Shut up!
Look at this!

You hungry?

[riders screaming]

[Elle] I'm so glad we took a break.
[Marco] Yeah, for once.

[chuckles] I can be a little obsessive.
You put a lot of pressure on yourself.

Yeah, well how else
are you gonna get what you want?

I don't know.

I don't like making plans.
I just kinda roll with things.

Yeah, but...

what do you wanna do?

Not sure.

Be happy, I guess.

But I gotta say, you inspire me.

Me?

You know what you want,
and you go after it.

No.

No, no.
That is the wrong impression of me.

I have no idea what I want to do
with my life.

You make things happen.

I admire it.

Well, I was gonna say that I...

admire <i>you</i> for just wanting to be happy.

I really am grateful for your help,
by the way.

I'm not exactly rich,
so this is is kinda like my moonshot

to pick where I wanna go to school.

What do you mean?

It's like something amazing
that you want really badly,

but it's not super likely to happen.

Like winning the DDM tournament.

No pressure.

Hmm.

"Moonshot."

Feels like pressure.

Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure.
[both laughing]


and I mean...

I don't need to get into all the details,
but there's this girl...

And you think he's involved with her?

I don't know. I mean...

I mean, he says he's not.

It's funny 'cause when he left,
I kinda had just assumed

that he would meet someone else

and then it would just be over for us,
you know?

Do you think
you and Noah were meant to be together?

I always thought we were.

But now...

I don't know.

It's like I'm trying so hard
to hold on to this...

thing, and it just feels
like it's slipping away.

I don't know Flynn,

but if I found someone who I loved,

that was smart and funny

and liked the same stuff I liked,

I'd never make her feel like that.

Wouldn't let her get away, huh?

I don't see it like that.

You can't really hold on to someone.

'Cause the tighter you hold on to them,
the more they wanna slip away.

All you can do is love them...

and make sure they know
that you're never gonna slip away.

if I'm saying that right.

No, you're... saying it perfectly.

So are you gonna go
to the Halloween dance?

I don't know yet.

Oh, right. Sorry, no plans. My bad.
[laughs] Exactly.

[sighs]

Hey.

Hey, listen, I'm sorry I didn't get
to call you last night.

I went out,
and I just left my phone at home.

That's okay. Uh, did you have fun?

Yeah, it was nice.
We saw this pretty great band.

<i>It was great.</i>

Cool.

Uh, who'd you go with?

Uh, just some of the guys.

Oh, um...

<i>The difference

Sounds like a lot of fun.

Yeah.

What do you think?
[Rachel scoffs]

What? That's so unfair!
[Lee] Oh!

I didn't know we were, like, doing...
Hi, Elle.


Look at my stupid pumpkin,
compared to his.

Lee, I thought we were carving pumpkins
today together.

I can't even make this better.

Ah, yeah, sorry.
Elle and I kinda got carried away.

Okay, well, I guess we can just go, then.

Cool, where we all going?

Uh...

Hey, Lee, let's go for a walk.


[Rachel laughs] Yeah! It'll be fun!

[indistinct chattering]

<i>â™ª I just wanna sleep instead... â™ª</i>

How's it going?

Oh, yeah, good.

Really?

Yeah.

Why? What do you mean?

Well, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but, um...

What's going on with you and Miles?

What do you mean?
There's nothing going on!

Oh! Okay, sorry. My bad.

Hey, I'm sorry.

No, no, I was wrong.
It's none of my business.

Yeah, but...

you're not wrong.

So you're into him?

I don't know. I don't know what I am.
I just...

I like him.

I'm not even sure why.
I mean, look at him. He's like...

Oof!

He's a total dork, right?

I don't know. He's kind of adorable.

And he's really smart.

And those dimples definitely don't hurt.

Yeah. [chuckles]

So what are you gonna do?

Nothing, probably.

Please don't say anything to anybody.

I would never, no.

But, Ollie,

you really shouldn't care
what the guys think.

And you definitely
shouldn't let it stop you

from being with someone that you like.

Believe me,
I know all about that, and it sucks.

would you like to dance?

Yeah, that would be really nice.

What's going on?
I'm not in the mood, Elle.

about the costume mix-up.

I had Lee switch it at the very last...

You just couldn't do as you were asked,
could you?

What? Rachel.

I'm sorry. Rachel, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

Did I do something?
Something?

Did you do <i>some thing?</i>

You crashed my prom.
You ruined bowling nights.

You wasted all of Lee's time
with your stupid dance game.

My God, Elle, with you around,

I literally can't spend a moment alone
with my own boyfriend!

Rachel, I had no idea
that you were feeling this way...

How can you stand there and say that
when we both know it's a lie?

I'm leaving now, and I'm going to my house
because that's the only way

that I can spend time with Lee...

Rachel.
Without you!

[all murmuring]

Rachel...

a friggin' marshmallow in the first place!

What happened?
Lee, are you coming?

Go, go, go. I'll find a ride...

[Marco chuckles]


Hello! I'm Toni.
I'm one of your judges tonight

and a professor
at the University of Southern California's

Interactive Media
and Video Gaming Department.

It's so exciting to be a part of the event
this year.

This has been
our fiercest competition yet.

I'm proud to announce that this year's
winners of the DDM West Coast Jam are...

Drum roll, please.

Elle Evans and MarcoÂ PeÃ±a!



<i>what they'll be in five years confronts
one undeniable fact.</i>

<i>Just as a great writer once said,</i>

<i>"Perhaps the Earth was made round</i>

<i>so that we would not see
too far down the road."</i>

<i>We set out on journeys full of hopes
and expectations, but when we arrive,</i>

<i>the destination never ends up looking
exactly the way we had hoped it would.</i>

Elle, wait. Please, stop!

with this right now.

So you're just gonna ignore
what's happening between us?

I'm really sorry. Can we just please
talk about this later? Please.


Congratulations.

<i>Noah still wasn't answering my texts.</i>

<i>And for some reason, neither was Lee.</i>

[Mrs. Flynn] Hey! The Evans clan arrives!
Hi!

<i>Thanksgiving dinner at the Flynns</i>

<i>would take care of both problems.</i>



Rachel, I've been trying to text you!


I know that you're upset, but...
Seriously, Elle.

Seriously, can you just talk to me?
Like, I don't know what's going on.

[Lee] Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.
[woman] Happy Thanksgiving, Lee!

Rachel's still so pissed at me.

Yeah, well, that would make two of us.

Why are you mad?

Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the answer is in here.

[papers slam]

Shit!

Gosh, wait, Lee.Â Listen to me. I'm...

[Noah] We're back!
[Mr. Flynn] Hey!

Ah, Chloe! Good to finally meet you.
Well, it's lovely to meet you too.

Yeah. Come inside.
Ooh! Wow.

Oh, and Elle, you are here!

Yeah, and so are you.

that you would be.

Really? Is that what he said?

Dinner's ready!

Careful with those yams.


Lee, do you wanna go talk for a second?

Not really, no.

Can we please just go talk?

Talking. I always feel like talking's
better when it's face-to-face.

[sighs] Lee.
So, Chloe, I hear Boston sucks.

I'm not really sure how to answer that.

It's fine if that's where people want
to live, but you shouldn't lie about it.

Lying. Lying is an interesting topic
of conversation.

Of course, people aren't always
making decisions alone.

You know, sometimes they need convincing
to do the really stupid shit.

Lee!
You need to shut your mouth.

You need to leave Lee out of this.

Why are you acting like I'm the one
that did something wrong?

Noah, you...

you don't wanna go there right now.

And, Lee, listen.

I am actually really sorry about applying
to schools in Boston, and, Rachel,

I don't even know
why you're mad at me right now.

So you're just gonna pretend
that Lee never told you

that we needed space
from you constantly hanging around us?

What?


Lee, you never...

Lee, you never said that.
Yes, he did! Lee, tell her.


[silverware clatters]

I tried to, but...

Rach. Rach.

Oh, my... I am so...
Rach.

Thank you for the invitation. I just...

Rachel.
[Lee] Rachel.

Rachel.

Rachel. Rachel, please!

She's my best friend.

You lied to me!

And you let me sayÂ all
of those horrible things to her.

I heard what you said
at your birthday party when Elle ran out.


I followed you two.


But being my best friend

doesn't give you the right to tell me
who I can love.

It's like with Rachel.

What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

I guess I'd break up with her.
[Elle] No, you see,

you shouldn't have to do that

<i>just because I didn't want you
to be with her.</i>

But you don't have to break up with me

because I can't be in a relationship
with you and Elle anymore.

It's just too much.

Rachel. [exhales]

I am grateful for family,

uh...

my new friend,

and...

my motorcycle.

Um, okay. Elle...

Oh.

Wow, what a tough act to follow.

Let's see.

I'm thankful for my family,

for that I just, you know,
won some money for school,

and... oh, yeah, oh, my God,

I am super-duper thankful

that, um, that I found Chloe's earring.

Oh, my God. Where did you find it?

Under Noah's bed.

But what I'm most thankful for is
that I found the earring...

before I did anything crazy,
like rearrange my whole life for someone.

You know, it kind of looked to me
like you'd already rearrangedÂ your life.

I think that maybe we should just...

You know what? This has been lovely.
Chloe, always a pleasure,

but I think it's time
for me to head out too. So...

[Elle sniffling]

[Mr. Evans] Elle.

Where are you going?

To fix something
that's actually worth saving.

And with Noah gone,
I was just... lonely, you know?

I didn't realize that I was even...
Cock-blocking?

Not sure if I would have phrased it
like that, but, yeah, I guess.

[chuckles, sobs]

The idea that I had something to do
with you guys breaking up,

I feel so...
No. Lee did this.

And he'd do it again
because that's how much you mean to him.

Rachel, he loves you so much.

And now that I know the problem,

I can absolutely fix...
[sighs] Elle!

It's rule number 16.

You know?

{\an8}[Elle] <i>Rule number 16: when
your bestie needs you there,</i>

{\an8}<i>you need to be there for your bestie.</i>

You know what I can't figure out though?

How did your earring get under my bed
in the first place?

Okay, about that...

Um, don't get pissy,

but when you were out of town
for a football game, I...

sort of crashed at your place
after getting into a fight with Jason

and the earring must have
just fallen off then.

Why wouldn't you tell me that?

That's just...
I said <i>don't </i>get pissy.

Now that we know what's happened,
we can fix this.

Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna fix it.

You know,
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

I can't believe that she thought
that I'd actually cheat on her, you know?

That's the reason I was lying
about us hanging out in the first place.

I was trying to avoid
this whole situation.

Listen to me.

Just to give you things
from Elle's point of view,

you used to have
quite the reputation, right?

And Elle has no idea that I am one
of the few women on the planet

immune to the charms of Noah Flynn.

And then she finds my earring,
which couldn't have been very helpful

to a woman who's missing her guy

all the way on the other side
of the country.

I don't like it when you're right.

Well, I do sleep where I'm not supposed to
from time to time,

but overall,

I'm a very talented individual.
[both laughing]

<i>â™ª These are the best days, days, days
Days, days â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª These are the best days, days... â™ª</i>


Can I help you before I go? Just...
[Mrs. Flynn] No, no, no.

I'll take care of this mess.

You go take care of yours.
[scoffs]

But, Elle, before you go,
I just want to say this afternoon,

I noticed the three of you doing
a lot of talking

and maybe not as much listening.

I just want to tell you make sure

that you really listen
to what the other person has to say.

Just hear them out, okay?

Okay.

Okay.

Oh! I almost forgot.

There's a thing I wanna take with me.

<i>â™ª A deer in the headlights

<i>â™ª Tongue-tied, she was dumbstruck

<i>â™ª The shadow... â™ª</i>


You should have told me
about applying to Harvard.

I know.

I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted to go to Berkeley.

I do.

It's just...[exhales]

Like, being away from NoahÂ was so much
harder than I thought it was gonna be.

And you should have told me
about how Rachel was feeling.

I was going to, but I just...

saw how lonely you were when Noah left.

You know that I would have understood.

Well, I guess the real reason
I didn't tell you was...

because I didn't want to.

I just always want you around.

[sighs] Lee.
But then I couldn't say no to Rachel,

pretended to hurt myself so that you'd be
busy practicing with Marco,

and then I would have time to hang out
with Rachel.

Just... God!

Now you know how I felt last year.
[sighs]

I didn't want to choose either,

but I had to make a choice.

Hey, one more thing.

Rule number 5.

You did not bring it with you.


What am I, a rookie?

{\an8}<i>Rule number 5:</i>

{\an8}<i>Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone
with your bestie.</i>

{\an8}Okay.

Here's wishing
that Rachel will give me a second chance.

So much for that.


All right, I'm giving us 48 hours
to feel sorry for ourselves.

Then we have Homecoming
and a kissing booth to do.

I don't know
if I should text her still.


[man chuckles] You ought to be proud,
let's be honest!

Tell your brother congratulations.

What did you say?
I said congratulations.


You have no business talking to me.


Someone says congratulations,
and you're ready to fight him.

You do have a problem.

No, the only problem I have
right now is you.

And you didn't come over here
to say congratulations, so just admit it.

Okay, let's go, Noah.

Noah.

Noah!

Let's go.

Good night.

I missed you too.

[Rachel gasps]

I am so sorry for ever making you feel

like anything less
than the most important person

in my life.

If you give me another chance,

I promise I will never...

make you feel that way ever again.

I love you so much.

And I don't wanna lose you.

You're not going to.

Everyone in this entire airport can see
that you are absolutely miserable.

You obviously want Elle.

So, as your friend, I have to demand
that you do something about it.

What's the point?

Look at me.

Do you love her?

I'm not talking to you
about this in an airport.

No. Stop it.

Do you love her?

Yeah.


because not telling her is just stupid.

And you are arrogant

and stubborn

and a pain in the ass,

â™ª <i>'Cause you don't have to go alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause I know we'll get
Through the storm... â™ª</i>


[Ollie exhales]
[crowd gasping, cheering]


Whoo! [chuckles]

[cheering]
[shouting]

Oh, my God!

<i>â™ª I will carry you... â™ª</i>

[laughs, cheers]

Oh, my God!


<i>â™ª I will be your guiding light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will carry you â™ª</i>

[Elle laughing] Whoa!

[cheering]
[Elle] Okay.



Kissin'! Here we go!Â [clicks tongue]

Okay.

Hello. [chuckles]

Sorry, I didn't realize I was gonna be
this nervous again! Oh, my goodness!

But don't worry. I've had, like,
three or four breath mints, so we are...

We are good to go
in that department.Â [laughs]



I was kinda just hoping
my ticket is worth a minute of your time.

Hi.

I should've called you. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry about the other night with Noah.
It was... it was stupid.

But you can't deny
there's something real between us.

I don't know what it is.

Maybe we just got caught up
in the moment or something,

'cause I... there's...
Please... please don't... do that.

We felt something.

I know it.

Don't be afraid of how you feel.

I know how being afraid can hold you back
from getting what you really want.

Why do you think I joined the council?

You're right.

I do have feelings for you.

When we kissed...

there was something there.

But you're not the one.

I really didn't mean to hurt you.

But you're not the one
that I'm lying to myself about.

And that's why I have to go,
and I have to find him

and find out what really happened.

I have to hear him out...

and make sure that he knows

I'm not slipping away.

[Elle shudders]

Goodbye, Marco.

[Marco sighs]

[rock music playing]

Sorry! Excuse me! Sorry! Sorry!

<i>â™ª Beginners in the house of love â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Like bulls in a china shop â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let me cast out
I'm moving way too fast â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And a dotted line</i>
<i>Was connected at last</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Without a clue, without a map â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We just never bothered to ask â™ª</i>

Excuse me!

<i>â™ª And if you wanna run away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll be running right after you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This thing is bigger than us
And I just can't get close enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So let's get crazy... â™ª</i>


Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

You look so much like my...
Elle?

What are you doing here?

Where's... where's Noah?

He left. He went looking for you.

Wait, what?

Look, that earring was nothing.

You've got to believe me, there is nothing
going on between Noah and me.

Do you know why he brought me home
for Thanksgiving?

He just wanted me there
so that we could become friends.

Oh, God.

I feel so stupid.
So does he.

But he is crazy about you.

You must know that.
[cell phone dings]

[Elle gasps]
[Chloe] Is that him?

Yeah.

What did he say?

He's at the kissing booth.
[both laugh]

Well, what are you waiting for?

Thank you, Chloe.

Good luck.

<i>â™ª I'll be running right after you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This thing is bigger than us
And I just can't get close enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I just can't get close enough
To you â™ª</i>

[Elle giggles]
[both laughing]

Hey, I really need to talk to you.

You don't even have to say anything.
No, Elle, please.

I need to say this.

When I started this school year,

I was pretty lonely,

and I wasn't really doing so well
in my classes.

Why didn't you say anything?

'Cause I was embarrassed.

Then I met, uh, Chloe,

and she showed me around,
introduced me to her friends and...

And...

I know we used to make fun of you and Lee
and your rules,

but I see what you guys have.

I guess a part of me just kinda wanted
to have the same thing with her.

Noah.

So then when you didn't believe
that her and I could just be friends,

it reminded me of what you used to think
about me...


And I didn't like that.

That was...

that was less about you and more just...

I just compared myself to her.

And when you left, I just kind of figured
that we would end,

so when I found the earring,

I made that the thing that would end it,
you know?

I know,
I wanted to stop you feeling jealous,

so I stopped telling you things.

I was so scared
you were gonna get on that plane...

before I could tell you
that I really didn't want you to go.

I thought I was leaving because of Marco.

[Elle scoffs]

I don't care that you kissed him,

but I need you to tell me...

do you love him?


Please try to remember
what I'm about to say, okay?

It's you, Noah.


It's always been you.


<i>in five years?</i>

<i>Well, to be perfectly honest,</i>

<i>I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

<i>Most kids my age, whether they'd admit it
in a college essay or not,</i>

<i>are still trying to figure that out.</i>

<i>And maybe it's because</i>
<i>it's less about </i>what <i>I want to be</i>

<i>and more about </i>who <i>I want to be.</i>

<i>Because I can tell you this:</i>

<i>in five years,
I want to beÂ my brother's joy.</i>

<i>I want to be my dad's love...</i>

[laughing]
<i>- And my mom's warmth.</i>

<i>In five years,
I want to be Rachel's kindness.</i>

I guess I'm next.


I'm telling you that I love you.

<i>And his mom's wisdom.</i>

<i>But most of all...</i>


<i>- I wanna be my best friend's laughter.</i>
[laughing]

<i>All those things together is
who I wanna be in five years.</i>


I leave you now with one final quote.

"I love to see a young girl go out
and grab the world by the lapels.

Life's a bitch.

[scattered laughter]
You have to go out and kick ass!"

Maya Angelou.


<i>to beÂ in five years.</i>

<i>And anything else beyond that,</i>

<i>well, I might have to wait until I get
where I'm going to figure that out.</i>



Oh, so have you heard from Berkeley yet?

Yeah.
And?

Um...

No, Lee first.

I got in!Â [shouts]
Oh, my God!

I have no idea. [laughs]

That's my boy! I knew you would!

All right, bro.
What's up?

So? What about you?

Um...

I, uh...

I...

I got wait-listed. Everywhere.

Berkeley

and Harvard.

I'm sorry, Rochelle.

Thanks, babe.


Come on, bro. She's not worth it.
[Lee] I'm sure one of them will pan out.

No, I know. You're right.

See you later.

[Lee] Don't worry.
Yeah.

Yes, she is.

Ooh! Let's just forget
about that right now. [chuckles]

I wanna do something fun.

What do you want to do?

["Good Vibrations" playing]
<i>- â™ª I... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I love the colorful clothes she wears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the way the sunlight
Plays upon her hair â™ª</i>

Okay.
Get 'em!

<i>â™ª I hear the sound of a gentle word â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On the wind that lifts her perfume
Through the air... â™ª</i>

Oh, hey! You want to race?

Oh, get ready to eat my dust!
[laughs]


Whoo!
[engine accelerating]

Whoo!
[laughs]

<i>â™ª Good vibrations, she's giving me...</i> â™ª

<i>and a long way from knowing everything.</i>

<i>But I do know enough
to want to be the very best parts</i>

<i>of the people I love best.</i>

<i>I only hope that someday I will be.</i>

<i>â™ª I'm picking up good vibrations â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She's giving me excitations</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Good, good, good, good vibrations â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She's giving me excitations â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª I'm picking up good vibrations â™ª</i>

Okay, remember, leave it to me
this time, all right? And no jokes.

Okay. You got it, boss.

Ooh.

[floor squeaks]

{\an8}[laughing]

{\an8}- [Elle] Oh, shit!
Yeah!

{\an8}Oh! Whoa!Â [laughs]

{\an8}Can you move that pickle to my bite?

You got scratches all over your face,
and you're kind of blurry.

Hey, wait a minute.

Let's hold on so I can take the time
to move a [bleeps] pickle.



Shoot!

<i>â™ª You got it all... â™ª</i>

You got it.
[laughing]

<i>â™ª Speeding through time never slowing down

Damn, girl.

[both shout]

Whoo! Daddy!

Oh, Lord!

[grunts]
[laughing]

Who you've selected
for this year's kissing lineup.

Sorry, I [bleeps] up that line.

God, I love her voice.

Sounds like sunshine.

[man] I can see right in your shirt.
[scattered laughter]

I'm sorry, by the way, for being an idiot,
getting my line wrong.

[laughing]
Let's start again.

[Lee] Why not?
Dude, I'm already...


[notes playing]
[man] Is there music?

Yeah, yeah. It's me.
I'm playing a slideshow.

Just gettin' in my emotions part of me,
everybody. [chuckles]

My Aunt Rose was just hit by a bus.

No.

On a gambling trip in Germany.

I have you... have mercy. Have mercy! No!
[growls]

Come on, Dad. Like, what the... [bleeps]

God! You always do this
when I'm in school.Â Shit!

[Elle yelps]
[cackling]

Okay, we'll take it from here?

[drawn out] Are you speaking
really slowly?


Hello, camera.

You guys sound amazing.
Lucky, Marco was available, huh?

Yeah, I was actually really surprised
when he called yesterday

to ask if he could play with us.

Yeah, it's literally falling off.
It's actually ridiculous.

Uh, Brad. It's time for a shower, bud.

But I showered two days ago.
And I'm about to do the ramp jump.

You have literally never made
that ramp jump in your life.

Hey!

[crowd cheering]
[laughs]

It's the John Travolta.
[crew laughs]

[snaps]
No way...

she's gonna give you a second chance, bae.


But in freestyle... but in... oh, my God.

[snaps fingers]

But in... freestyle.
Freestyle.

Today's the difference.

[imitating bird cries]
[trilling]

[both laughing]

that broke his [bleeps] right off.

Oh, my God.Â It literally worked.

Hello, there. Uh, I'm Lee Flynn.
[Lee] And I'm Elle Evans.

We are your hosts of...
[both] <i>Game On!</i>


[cheering]
I called that shit.

[snorts]
[cheering]

[shouts]
This is stupid.


[Lee] Yearbook!
[all shout]

I'm sorry. I'd like to take that again,

'cause I smacked an extra.

[Vivian chuckles]
So when will Marco be getting here?

Marco's actually not working
with usÂ anymore.

Babes, that was not...
It's on your head now. What's she done?

It's my line. I'm sorry. [laughs]

He's, like, the most cool person ever.
Wouldn't [bleep] marry me.

[laughing]
[indistinct]

I thought we were... shit!

Hey, how come I never wear sunglasses
to school?

I don't know.
'Cause we drive a convertible.
