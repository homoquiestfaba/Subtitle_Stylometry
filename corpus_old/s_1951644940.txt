GOYA'S GHOSTS

HOLY OFFICE OF THE INQUISITION

And these are actually for sale
in the bookshops?

And in the streets as well,
Father.

And in Toledo?
In Toledo. In Salamanca,

Sevilla.

And in the Port of Cádiz.

So these prints
are sent abroad?

These are sold in Rome.

Even as far as Mexico.

This is how the world sees us.

This,
this is how the world is seeing us.

What is the name of the artist?

Francisco Goya.

Isn't he the man you commissioned
to paint your portrait?

He is, Father.

Why did you choose him?

In all humility, Father,

I chose him for the same reason
our King and the Queen

have appointed him
to be the Court painter.

They consider him the greatest
painter in Spain.

These prints are quite disturbing,
I must say.

Disturbing?

Yes, yes, of course they are.

But, Father, these prints

show us
the true face of our world.

Maybe your world,
Brother Lorenzo.

How can you call
these hideous images

"the true face of our world"?

There is but one world, Brother,

and it is neither yours, nor mine.
It is the Lord's.

Have you lost your sight,
Brother?

Do you not see what demonic filth
and degradation

this Goya is selling?

He's an agent
of the darkest powers!

Granted that he's decorated
chapels.

He's painted angels, yes,

but when your mother raises her
eyes to pray to God

whom do you think she sees?

Whom do you think Goya
is using as models

for his angels?

Harlots!

Those are whores smiling down
at your mother from the ceiling!

I assert

before all of you

that Goya is a valuable
member of the Church.

How so?

Father, I have met women

who cannot recite
a single prayer.

It's them...

We have to seek them out,

but what is our response?

Condemn this great
Spanish artist instead?

Or do you think,
by burning Goya's canvases

the evil this artist
has depicted

will go up in flames?

Why don't we look at ourselves?

What have we accomplished

in the last 50 years?

How many heretics
have we sent to the stake?

I will tell you exactly how many,
Father. Eight.

Eight burned at the stake.

Are you proposing we show

greater severity?

Yes, Father, yes.
We have to return to the old ways.

I'm talking about the God- fearing
ways of the past.

Are you prepared
to join this battle?

Never mind join,

grant me the wisdom to lead it,
Father.

Why doesn't that painting
have a face?

Because he's a ghost.

No, he is not!

Have you ever seen a ghost?

No.

But I have seen a witch.

Oh, did you?
Yes, but she had a face.

What did she look like?

She was all bent and creepy,

and she stank... Phew!

That's interesting.
Because the witch that I know

she's young, very lovely,

and she smells of jasmine.

She does?
She does.

And I'm working on her portrait
right now.

I'm no witch!

How do you know?

Am I allowed to say something?

Please.
I know that face.

She would not be
one of your angels

in the Florida chapel, would she?

Yes, she is.
You're dangerously perceptive.

This is probably a very naive

but I am a man of the cloth.

Do you...?

Do you painters not become very
intimate with your models?

It must be very...

tempting...

when you spend hours
and hours alone with,

not only beautiful,

but young girl.

Would you like me to include
your hands in the portrait?

I'll leave that up to you.
No, it's up to you to decide.

Hands are not easy to paint

and not everybody will spend
the extra money.

Well, what is the difference?

One hand, two thousand reales.
Two hands, three thousand.

Why did you agree to paint
my portrait?

Why not?

You have the reputation of mocking
the men of cloth in your work.

And harshly, I must say.

Do I?

Are you aware of how many powerful
enemies you have, Goya?

Fortunately, I also have
a few very powerful friends.

How have you been, dear Goya?

As always, Your Majesty
So don't complain.

I endeavor not to, Your Majesty.

Is this the wild steed

that I am to conquer today?

Oh, dear!

So how do you want me to ride?

How do you want history to perceive
you, madam?

The way I am,

young and beautiful.

Which one do you wish for supper,
my dear?

Maybe...

the vulture.

May I stay

and watch you work for a while?

Why, if I may have any say
in the matter, Your Majesty,

I'd prefer no- one see the work
before it's finished.

Am I intruding?

Yes,

you are, my dear.

Oh, I see.

As you wish,

as you will,

whatever is your pleasure.

How long do I have to sit up here?

For as long as I may need you there,
Your Majesty.

See what I am carrying?

I must be a pious man, right?

But look at what
is really inside this.

Voltaire!

Voltaire!

The Dark Prince
of the darkest principles!

Devious. Devious.

Be vigilant, use your ears.

People talk.

You might hear somebody
claiming that matter

consists of very small elements,
called atoms.

Get his name.

He's a heretic

spreading these diabolical ideas

to poison the souls
of God- fearing people.

If you hear somebody talking
about 'The Temple',

instead of 'The Church',

he is either a Judaiser,
or, even worse, a Protestant.

Get his name.

If you are in a public place
and see a man

hiding his penis with his hand
while urinating

the man is probably circumcised.

And he's a Judaiser!

I am giving you
just a few examples

of what to look for,
whom to identify.

Bring their names to the attention
of Holy Office.

Your eyes, your ears,
your brain.

They are the servants of God.

Come on, Inés.
Taste it, it's good.

Come on.

Hey, where are you going?
Oh, she's going to the dwarf.

What did you do?

Inés, wipe your mouth.
No.

You have received a summons
from the Holy Office.

Do you have any idea
what it might be about?

No.

Where did you go with your brothers
last night?

The Tavern.

Think!

Did you say something sacrilegious?

No.

Was there an incident
they could hold against her?

She kissed the feet of a dwarf.

You did?
She did.

Everyone did!
You know, they can summon her

just to testify
against someone else?

Someone else?

Is there someone you know
they might be interested in?

I don't know.

No!

Do not worry, my child.

My child.

In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

Sit down, please.

Are you Inés Bilbatua,

begat by one
Tomás Pio Bilbatua

and his wife María Isabel?

Yes, I am.
We have only a few questions

and we expect you
to answer truthfully.

I will.

Is it true that on Wednesday,
the 16th of this month

you dined at the inn
of Dona Julia?

Yes, it is.

What were you served that evening?

For dinner?
Oh, yes.

You actually want to know
what we ate?

For dinner.

I had chicken.

Onions,

chickpeas.

Chickpeas.

And?

Potatoes.

Green peppers.

Were you served pork?

Yes, but I didn't have any.

Why not?
I don't like the taste.

Are you prepared to swear
on the Holy Cross

that you're telling the truth?

About the pork?

Are you?

I swear on Jesus's sacred wounds,
I'm telling you the truth.

And I suppose
that you would not object

if we gave you an opportunity
to prove it?

No, I would be grateful.

How would you like me to prove it?

Did you tell us the truth?

Yes! Yes, I did!

We have reason
to suspect otherwise.

Why?

We suspect the reason you avoid pork
is because you are secret Judaiser.

What?

Are you?
What is that?

You practice Jewish rituals.

No, I do not!

You have something to confess.
Do it now.

But I...
What do you want me to confess?

The truth.

But I did!

Tell me what the truth is!

Tell me what the truth is!

Hey, Tomás, how wonderful
to see you, my friend.

How are you, Francisco?
Come in, come in.

Can I offer you anything?
No, nothing, thank you.

Are we alone?

Yes.

I need to speak with this man,
Francisco.

Why?

My daughter Inés has been summoned
by the Holy Office.

Inés?
Yes.

That's preposterous.

She went in this morning
and she hasn't come out yet.

And we haven't heard
a word, either.

Do you know why they
wanted to talk to her?

No. That's why I would like
to speak with this man.

Francisco, I'm very sorry
to have to ask you this,

but is there any way
you can arrange it?

But I'm in no position to curry
favors from the Inquisition...

No, no favors.
I'm simply trying to learn

if there is anything at all
I can do to help my daughter.

I wish I...

No! I cannot talk
to the Holy Office

about any matter

that does not pertain directly
to me.

I'm sorry.

I beg you, Francisco.

Father Lorenzo.

Come in.

This way.

If I were to meet this man
on the street,

I would never recognize myself
in him.

One has such a different idea
of oneself.

You think you might like him?

I know I like the painting of him.

Yes, yes...

I'm very pleased
with it, Francisco.

Shall I choose a frame for it?
Yes, please, do.

And there's no need to send money.
What do you mean?

Somebody's paying for it.
Who's paying for it?

His name is Tomás Bilbatua.

He's a very rich merchant.

He also intends to underwrite

the reconstruction of the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

He's also asked me to paint
frescos throughout the Convent,

which is a very welcome
commission, I must admit.

What is his name?
Bilbatua.

What does Senor Bilbatua want
from me?

He's the father of...

You recall seeing her face on the
ceiling in the Florida chapel?

Yes?

She's been arrested
by the Holy Office.

I know him quite well.
He's a very honorable man.

Don't be afraid.

Inés Bilbatua?
Yes.

I am hereto see if I can...

possibly be of some assistance.

May I go home now?

I don't have the power
to decide that, Inés.

I wanna go home.

Do not fear, my child.

I can deliver a message
to your family...

Do you want me to?

Please.

Will you tell them
that I love them?

I love them so much.

And please,

tell them that always,

when I shut my eyes

and I pray to God

I beseech Him
to let me see my mother

and my father

and my brothers,

when I open my eyes...

Do you want me to pray with you?
Yes, please.

<i>Glory to God on high.</i>

<i>And on earth peace
to men of good will.</i>

<i>We praise You, we bless You,
we adore You, we glorify You.</i>

<i>We give You thanks
for Your great Glory.</i>

<i>O Lord God, heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty.</i>

<i>O Lord Jesus Christ,
the only- begotten Son.</i>

<i>O Lord Jesus Christ, Lord God,
Lamb of God...</i>

Very good, Inés.

I'll take care of you.

It's all right, it's all right.

Hello! Welcome.
Tomás!

<i>- Gracias, Padre.
Thank you, Jose.</i>

How are you, Francisco?
I'm very well, thank you.

Father Lorenzo.

It's a great honor for me to welcome
you in my house, Father Lorenzo.

This way, please.
These are my sons.

Ángel... and Álvaro.

Hello, Ángel.

And this is my dear wife...

María Isabel.

Father Lorenzo,

welcome to our house.

Thank you.
Please.

Francisco, thank you.

The time has come for me
to repay

the Lord
for all his kindness

by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

You know,
Tomás being my own name,

I'm very sorry that my daughter
cannot dine with us tonight.

A most...

a most marvelous work indeed,
Goya.

Thank you.

As I was saying,

the time has come for me to repay
the Lord for all His kindness

by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

<i>Bless us, o Lord,</i>

<i>and your gifts,</i>

<i>which from your bounty we are about
to receive through Christ our Lord.</i>

Amen.

To the successful restoration
of the Convent of Saint Tomás.

This wine is excellent.

It was aged on a ship that has gone
twice around the world.

It takes constant motion

to bring out the flavor
in this particular wine.

I didn't know that.

And these are anchovies
from Santoña.

I presume that you're anxious
to have some news of your daughter.

Oh, yes,

extremely so.

She has never ever been away.
Did you see her?

Yes, I did.

How is she?

She's in fine spirits

and sends her love
to all of you.

When can we expect her home?

I couldn't say.
She must first stand trial.

Stand trial?

Why?

For what she has confessed.

What did she confess?

That she had secretly practiced

the Jewish rituals
of her forbears.

But that's impossible.

We are an old Christian family.

Correct me if I'm wrong

but the Brothers in charge
of the archives...

informed me that your
grandmother's great- grandfather

converted from Judaism to
Christianity when he came to Spain

from Amsterdam in 1624.

Is that true?

Yes.

But I am the only person
in the family who knows that.

Then why has your daughter
confessed to it?

Inés couldn't possibly confess to
something she has no knowledge of.

Excuse me,

was my sister put
to 'The Question'?

Yes, she was.

My daughter was tortured?

She was put to 'The Question'.

I thought that kind
of 'investigation'

had been abandoned years ago.

Yes, it was,

but now
in these troubled times,

in its quest for the truth,
the Church is bringing it back.

So...

you maintain that a confession
obtained by the means of

as you call it 'The Question'
is valid proof of anything?

This is not an opinion
of one simple monk, sir.

It is a tenet of Church
teaching that a confession

attained by 'The Question'
constitutes ultimate proof.

I'm sorry, Lorenzo,

but how can this sort
of confession be an ultimate proof?

If I were tortured, I'd confess
to anything.

I'd confess
I was the Turkish sultan.

No, you wouldn't.

I would confess to anything
to avoid pain.

No, you wouldn't.

You're a God- fearing man, Goya,
aren't you?

Of course I am.

So, your fear of God would prevent
you from making a false confession.

But what ifthe pain obscured
my senses?

What if my fear of pain
became bigger

than my fear of God?

If you are innocent of the charge,
God will give you the strength

to withstand the pain.

Are you sure of that?
Yes.

Forgive me, Father Lorenzo,

but have you ever been
put to the...

to 'The Question' yourself?

Have I ever been?
Yes.

Have you ever been subjected
to 'The Question'?

Of course not.

Do you think that if you were

and they asked you to confess

something grotesquely absurd,

say...

say you were told to confess that
you are really a monke...

are you sure that God

would grant you the fortitude
to deny it?

Or would you rather confess
to being a monkey

to avoid the pain?

I know I would.

I know you would.
So would I.

Would you?

What is this? Are you playing some
sort of silly game with your guest?

Nobody would ever ask Father Lorenzo
to confess something so absurd.

I would.

Is he serious?
Oh, I'm sure he's not.

Álvaro, go get your father.

Sometimes I don't understand
his humor.

Nobody does.

Because my father doesn't have
a sense of humor.

Oh, yes, he does.

More wine?
No, thank you.

Francisco?

"I, Lorenzo Casamares,

hereby confess that, contrary
to my human appearance,

am, in fact,

the bastard son of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan

and I have schemed
to join the Church in order

to do harm to the Holy Office."

Sign it.

This is a joke, Tomás, right?

Sign it.

Ángel, block the door.

Francisco, escort me out
of this house.

Stop Senor Goya.

Are you crazy?
Francisco, please stay out of this.

Let us go.
You can go.

What do you mean I can go?
And Father Lorenzo?

Did he let my daughter go?

Did you let my innocent daughter
go?

Did he?

Keep him here.
Let Senor Goya go.

Release him!

<i>Escort Señor Goya out.</i>

Tomás!

Take your hands off me!
This is outrageous.

Are you ready to sign
the confession?

María Isabel.

Bring him here.

Sign it.

Tie his hands.

Will you sign?

All right.

Let's find out if God will give
you the strength

to resist 'The Question'.

Lift him up.

I will burn this paper

the moment
my daughter returns home.

But I won't wait forever.

You must understand that.

All right, you are free to go now.

Father Lorenzo?

You're forgetting something.

This might be of great help
to both of us.

This is a very generous
contribution, indeed.

We are grateful for your efforts,

Brother Lorenzo.

There is a request, Father.

There usually is.

Let us hear the particulars.

The merchant

would like
to have his daughter back.

Is she with us?
Yes, Father. Yes.

What is her status?
A Judaiser.

How did you respond
to this request?

I promised
to plead for her release.

On what grounds?
I took into consideration...

the size of the endowment as well
as the fact

that she is very young.

Did she confess?

Yes, Father.

She was put to 'The Question'.

We shall accept
this magnanimous gift

with humble gratitude.

We shall also carve the name
of the donor

in the Convent in stone
to commemorate

his generosity forever.

As for the daughter,

I will pray to the Lord He may
bestow His mercy on her.

Of course, releasing her would
contradict

the basic principles
of our faith,

because it would suggest
that the Church

doubts the power
of 'The Question'.

We are concluded.

Did you see my parents?
Yes, I did, I did.

They are doing everything
they can to get you out.

And?

And...

they love you very much, Inés.

Shall we pray together, Inés?

I can't believe it.

"I am, in fact,
the bastard son

of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan...

Can you believe this idiot?

He's crazy.

Your Majesty,

I am a desperate father

and this was done only to prove
that, if put to 'The Question'

even the most innocent man
of cloth

will confess to the most
preposterous absurdities.

Yes.

We beg you, Your Majesty,
please use your authority

to restore our daughter to us.

Yes,
I will see what I can do for her.

I had a good look at the signature.

There can be no mistake?
It is Lorenzo's.

Where is Brother Lorenzo?

All the brothers are looking
for him, Father).

Yes?
Francisco Goya y Lucientes?

At your service.

We have been told
that you are painting

a portrait
of Lorenzo Casamares.

Yes, please come in.

It's already finished.
This way.

I hope Father Lorenzo

is pleased with the frame
we've chosen for it.

Lorenzo Casamares
disgraced himself

and he is now a fugitive.

A fugitive?

I see.

We're here to confiscate
the portrait.

Yes, of course.

If he were to contact you,

we would like
to be notified immediately.

Well, certainly.

Oh, incidentally,

I have not yet been paid
for the painting.

If we find him,
we'll remind him.

As the image of the man

vanishes into thin air...

may his name forever vanish

from all memory.

Whosoever pronounces his name

may he burn in the fires

of eternal damnation.

She will like this frame.
You've done beautiful work.

I've never been this close
to our Queen.

But... is she really that ugly?

What's your point?
It's a beautiful painting.

Yes, but that does not make
a Queen beautiful.

<i>Don Francisco,</i>

Her Majesty wishes for you
to go to His Majesty's chamber.

Please, sit.

Sit, please.

Please, sit

How did you like it?

Very much, Your Majesty.
Very much.

Are you telling me the truth?
I am, I am. I was very...

moved, Your Majesty.

Not now.

Do you know
who composed that piece?

No, not really, sire.

Mozart, maybe? No.

Händel?

I did.
Really?

Congratulations, Your Majesty.

Excellent and beautifully
performed. performed.

So much for art.
Now, sire,

I wonder if I could have
your opinion on my...

All right, come in.

Your Majesty...
I have come from Paris.

The French rabble

has decapitated the King
of France.

The King of France?

Yes, Your Majesty.
King Louis.

He was guillotined
in a public execution

six days ago.

My cousin Louis?

Yes, sire.

15 YEARS LATER

Our soldiers must comprehend
the noble purpose of their mission.

They carry a personal message
from me, Napoleon Bonaparte,

that I will not stand by
and watch our Spanish neighbors

continue to suffer the tyranny

of corrupt and decadent kings,

repressive clergy
and foreign imposters.

Yes, the King of Spain
is not even Spanish.

He is French.
And the Queen of Spain...

She is Italian!

No wonder the Spanish people
hate the Royal Family

as much as they hate
the Inquisition.

You have never fought

an easier campaign, soldiers!

The common folk will greet you
with flowers and kisses

on the streets of Madrid!

The Spaniard cannot wait
to break his chains

and become a free man.

Long live Napoleon.

<i>I can see these explosions
but I can't hear them.</i>

<i>I'm deaf.</i>

<i>I am completely deaf now,
but every morning</i>

<i>I thank the Lord that
He hasn't taken my sight away</i>

<i>that I've been able to witness</i>

<i>and record
what has been happening here.</i>

<i>These are French soldiers.</i>

<i>The Mamelukes.</i>

<i>Special cavalry recruited
from Egypt by Napoleon</i>

<i>to help liberate Spain.</i>

<i>To bring us the noble ideas
of the French Revolution.</i>

<i>Liberty,</i>

<i>equality,</i>

<i>brotherhood.</i>

<i>Then to defend the ideas
of the Revolution</i>

<i>Napoleon, this scourge of royalty,</i>

<i>made his own brother,
Joseph, the King of Spain.</i>

<i>But to my fellow Spaniard,</i>

<i>Napoleon's armies are nothing
but foreign invaders,</i>

<i>occupiers.</i>

Who is in command
of this place?

God

is in command of this

and every other place
on this earth, my son.

In the name of Emperor Napoleon...
Continue.

...and by the letter
of the Rights...

Brother? Brother?

Brothers, give him air,
let him breathe here.
