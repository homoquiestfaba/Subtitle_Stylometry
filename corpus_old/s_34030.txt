( Sonar Pings)



Man: 13 meters. You should see it.



( Sonar Pings)



Okay ,  take her up  
and over the bow rail.

( Over Radio): 
Okay ,  Mir2 , we're going over the bow.

Stay with us.



( Sonar Pings)



( Mechanical Whirring)



Okay ,  quiet. We're rolling.

Seeing her coming out of 
 the darkness like a ghost ship

still gets me every time--

To see the sad ruin 
 of the great ship sitting here

where she landed at 2:30 
 in the morning of April 1 5 ,  1 91 2

after her long fall 
 from the world above.

( Man Snickers) 
 You are so full of shit ,  boss.

( Giggles) 
 - ( Mechanical Whirring)

( Sonar Pinging)



Man: Dive six-- Here we are again 
 on the deck of Titanic

2 1/2 miles down

3 , 821 meters.



The pressure outside is 
 3 1/2 tons per square inch.

These windows are nine inches thick 
 and if they go

it's sayonara 
 in two microseconds.

All right ,  enough 
 of that bullshit.



( Mechanical Whirring)

Just put her down on the roof of 
 the officer's quarters like yesterday.

Man: Sure. 
 - Man ( Over Radio): Okay ,  Mir 2.

We have landed right on the grand 
 stair case. You guys set to launch?

Yeah ,  Brock-- Launching Dunkin now. 
 Go ,  Charlie.



All right ,  tether out. 
 - Man: Tether out.

Man ( Over Radio): Okay ,  Brock ,  
 we're dropping down along the hull.



Roger that. Okay ,  drop down and go 
 into the first-class gangway door.



I want you guys working the D deck 
 reception area and the dining saloon.

Man ( Over Radio): 
 Copy that.



Tether out. 
 - Man: Tether out.

Now left ,  left. 
 - I'm coming left.



Brock: 
 Snoop Dog is on the move.

We're headed down the stairwell.



Okay ,  Lewis ,  drop down to B deck. 
 A deck.

Lewis: 
 Give me some rope ,  Captain.

B deck-- get in there ,  
 get in there.



Brock: Watch the door frame. 
 Watch the door frame.

I see it. I got it. 
 - ( Bang)

( Mechanical Whirring)

( Cracking) 
 - We're good. Just chill ,  boss.



Brock: 
 Make your turn. Come around.

Lewis: Cable out ,  Captain. 
 - Make your turn. Watch the wall.

Yeah ,  Brock ,  
 we're at the piano ,  you copy?

Brock: 
 Okay ,  copy that.



Brock: Okay ,  right there. 
 Right there. That's it!

That's the bedroom door. 
 - I see it. I see it.



We're in! 
 We're in ,  baby. We're there!



Brock: That's Hockley's bed. 
 That's where the son of a bitch slept.



Lewis: 
 Oops ,  somebody left the water running.

Hey ,  hold it just a second. 
 Go back to the right.



That wardrobe door-- 
 get closer.

You smelling something ,  boss? 
 - I want to see what's under it.

Give me my hands ,  man. 
 - ( Mechanical Whirring)



All right.

Take it easy ,  it might come apart. 
 - Okay.

Go ,  go ,  go ,  go. 
 Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.

Keep going ,  go ,  go ,  go. 
 Okay ,  drop it.



Oh ,  baby ,  baby ,  
 are you seeing this ,  boss?



It's payday ,  boys.



(Man Speaking Over Loud speaker)



( Cheering)

( Imitates Cash Register): 
 Ka-ching!

We did it ,  Bobby. 
 - Lewis: Oh , yeah. Who's the man?

Who's the best ,  baby? 
 Say it. Say it.

You are ,  Lewis.

( Saw Buzzing Loudly)

Bobby ,  my cigar. 
 - Bobby: Right here.

( Cheering)



Brock: 
 Okay ,  crack her open.



( Man Speaking Over Loud speaker)



Shit.

No diamond.

You know ,  boss ,  this same thing 
 happened to Geraldo

and his career never recovered.



Turn the camera off.

Bobby: Brock ,  the partners 
 would like to know how it's going.

Hey ,  Dave ,  Barry ,  hi. 
 Look ,  it wasn't in the safe

but hey ,  hey ,  
 don't worry about it.

There's still plenty 
 of places it could be.

Hell yes! Floor debris in the suite ,  the 
 mother's room ,  purser's safe on C deck.

Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. 
 Brock: A dozen other places.

Guys ,  look , you've just got to trust 
 my instincts. I know we're close.

We just got to go through 
 a little process of elimination.

Hang on a second.



Let me see that. 
 - We might have something here ,  guys.



Where's the photograph 
 of the necklace?



We'll call you right back.



I'll be goddamned.



Reporter: Treasure hunter Brock Lovett 
 is best known for finding Spanish gold.

It's okay. 
 I'll feed you in a minute.



Now he has chartered 
 Russian subs to reach

the most famous ship wreck 
 of all: the Titanic.

He is with us live 
 via satellite

from the research ship Keldysh 
 in the North Atlantic.

Hello ,  Brock. 
 - Brock: Hello ,  Tracy.

Everyone knows the familiar 
 stories of Titanic--

the nobility ,  the band playing 
 till the very end and all that.

But what I'm interested in 
 are the untold stories

the secrets locked deep 
 inside the hull of Titanic.

We're out here using 
 robot technology

to go further into the wreck 
 than anybody's ever done before.

Your expedition is at the center 
 of a storm of controversy

over salvage rights 
 and even ethics.

Many are calling you 
 a grave robber.

Nobody called the recovery of artifacts 
 of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."

Woman: What is it? 
 - Turn that up ,  dear.

I have museum-trained experts 
 out here making sure

that these relics are preserved 
 and catalogued properly.



Take a look at this drawing 
 that we found just today:

A piece of paper that's been 
 under water for 84 years

and my team were able 
 to preserve it intact.

Should this have remained unseen at 
 the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

I'll be goddamned.

Man (Over Loud speaker): 
 Vnimanye ,  vnimanye...

Bobby: Brock! 
 There's a satellite call for you.

Bobby ,  we're launching. You see 
 these submersibles going in the water?

Trust me ,  buddy. 
 You want to take this call.



This better be good.



You got to speak up. 
 She's kind of old.

Great. This Brock Lovett.



How can I help you ,  Mrs.-- 
 - Calvert. Rose Calvert.

Mrs. Calvert?

I was just wondering if you had found 
 the Heart of the Ocean yet ,  Mr. Lovett.



Told you you wanted 
 to take the call.



All right , you have 
 my attention ,  Rose.



Can you tell us who the woman 
 in the picture is?

Oh , yes. 
 The woman in the picture is me.



( Yelling Over Engine Noise): 
 She's a goddamned liar--



Some nut case seeking 
 money or publicity.

God only knows why ,  like that 
 Russian babe ,  Anesthesia.

They're inbound!



Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic 
 when she was 1 7 ,  right?

That's right. 
 - If she had lived ,  she'd be over 1 00.

101 next month.

Okay ,  so she's a very old 
 goddamned liar.



Look ,  I've already done 
 the background on this woman

all the way back to the '20s 
 when she was working as an actress.

An actress! There's 
 your first clue ,  Sherlock.

Her name was Rose Dawson back then. 
 Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

They move to Cedar Rapids 
 and she punches out a couple of kids.

Now ,  Calvert's dead ,  and from what 
 I hear ,  Cedar Rapids is dead.

And everybody who 
 knows about the diamond

is supposed to be dead 
 or on this boat ,  but she knows.



Doesn't exactly 
 travel light ,  does she?



Mrs. Calvert ,  I'm Brock Lovett. 
 Welcome to the Keldysh.



Okay ,  let's get her 
 inside there.

Hi ,  Ms. Calvert. 
 - Hi.

Welcome to the Keldysh.

Man: 
 Hey. Hey!



( Knocking) 
 - Rose: Yes?

Are your staterooms all right? 
 - Rose: Oh , yes ,  very nice.

Have you met 
 my grand daughter Lizzie?

She takes care of me.

We met just 
 a few minutes ago.

Remember ,  Nana ,  up on deck?

There ,  that's nice.

Have to have my pictures 
 when I travel.

Can I get you anything? 
 Is there anything you'd like?



Yes.

I would like to see my drawing.



Brock: 
 Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

that was called 
 the Blue Diamond of the Crown

which disappeared in 1 792

about the same time old Louis 
 lost everything from the neck up.

The theory goes that 
 the crown diamond was chopped ,  too

recut into a heart-like shape that 
 became known as "Heart of the Ocean."

Today it would be worth more 
 than the Hope Diamond.

It was a dreadful ,  heavy thing. 
 I only wore it this once.

Lizzie: 
 You actually think this is you ,  Nana?

It is me ,  dear. 
 Wasn't I a dish?



I tracked it down 
 through insurance records--

An old claim that was settled 
 under terms of absolute secrecy.



Can you tell me 
 who the claimant was ,  Rose?

I should imagine 
 someone named Hockley.

Brock: Nathan Hockley ,  that's right. 
 Pittsburgh steel tycoon.



Claim was for 
 a diamond necklace



his son Caledon 
 bought his fianc√©e--you

a week before 
 he sailed on Titanic.

It was filed right 
 after the sinking

so the diamond had to have 
 gone down with the ship.



You see the date?

"April 1 4 ,  1 91 2."

Which means if your grandmother is 
 who she says she is

she was wearing the diamond 
 the day the Titanic sank.

And that makes you 
 my new best friend.

These are some of the things 
 we recovered from your stateroom.



This was mine.

How extraordinary!

And it looks the same as it did 
 the last time I saw it.



The reflection 
 has changed a bit.



( Gasps Quietly)



Are you ready to go 
 back to Titanic?



Lewis: Okay ,  here we go. She hits 
 the berg on the starboard side ,  right?

She kind of bumps along punching holes 
 like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--

along the side ,  
 below the waterline.

Then the forward compartments 
 start to flood.

Now as the water level rises ,  it 
 spills over the watertight bulkheads

which unfortunately 
 don't go any higher than E deck.

So now as the bow goes down ,  
 the stern rises up

slow at first ,  then faster 
 and faster until finally

she's got her whole ass is sticking 
 up in the air and that's a big ass.

We're talking 
 20 , 000 ,  30 , 000 tons ,  okay?

And the hull's not designed to deal 
 with that pressure ,  so what happens?

She splits ,  
 right down to the keel



and the stern 
 falls back level.

Then as the bow sinks ,  it pulls the 
 stern vertical and finally detaches.

Now ,  the stern section just 
 kind of bobs there like a cork

for a couple of minutes ,  floods and 
 finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

two hours and 40 minutes 
 after the collision.

The bow section planes away 
 landing about a half a mile away

going 20 ,  30 knots when 
 it hits the ocean floor.

( imitates Crashing)

Pretty cool ,  huh?

Thank you for that fine 
 forensic analysis ,  Mr. Bodine.

Of course ,  
 the experience of it was

somewhat different.

Will you share it with us?



( Music Playing)



( Crying)

I'm taking her to rest. 
 - No.

Come on ,  Nana. 
 - No!



Tape recorder.



Tell us ,  Rose.



It's been 84 years.

It's okay. Just try to remember 
 anything-- anything at all.

Do you want to hear this 
 or not ,  Mr. Lovett?



It's been 84 years...

and I can still smell 
 the fresh paint.



The china had never been used.

The sheets had never 
 been slept in.



Titanic was called 
 "The Ship of Dreams"

and it was ,  it really was.



Man: All third-class passengers 
 with a forward berth

this way ,  please ,  this queue.



Right here.  - Big boat ,  huh? 

Daddy ,  it's a ship. 
 - You're right.

( Car Horn Tooting)



I don't see what 
 all the fuss is about.

It doesn't look any bigger 
 than the Mauritania.

You can be blas√© about some things ,  
 Rose ,  but not about Titanic.

It's over 1 00 feet longer than 
 Mauritania and far more luxurious.

Your daughter is far too difficult 
 to impress ,  Ruth.

So this is the ship 
 they say is unsinkable.

It is unsinkable. 
 God Him self could not sink this ship.

Sir ,  you have to check 
 your baggage through the main terminal.

It's round that way ,  sir. 
 - I put my faith in you ,  good sir.

Now ,  kindly see my man. 
 - Yes ,  sir ,  my pleasure ,  sir.

If I can do anything at all. 
 - Oh ,  yes ,  right.

All the trunks 
 from that car there

12 from here ,  and the safe...

to the parlor suite ,  
 rooms B-52 ,  54 ,  56.

( Whistle Blowing) 
 - Ladies...

better hurry.

( People Saying Good-byes)

My coat? 
 - Woman: I have it.

Man: All third-class passengers 
 due here for a health inspection.

All third-class passengers 
 due here for health inspection.

Head up.



Welcome aboard ,  ma'am. 
 Welcome to Titanic.

Rose: It was the Ship of Dreams 
 to everyone else.

To me it was a slave ship

taking me back to America 
 in chains.

Outwardly ,  I was everything 
 a well-brought-up girl should be.

Inside ,  I was screaming.

( Steam Whistle Blows Loudly)



( Speaking Swedish)



Jack ,  you are pazzo. 
 You bet everything we have.

When you got nothing 
 you got nothing to lose.



Sven?



All right ,  moment of truth.

Somebody's life's about to change. 
 Fabrizio?



-Niente. 
 -Niente.



Olaf? 
 - Nothing.

Sven?



Uh-oh. Two pair.

I'm sorry ,  Fabrizio.

Che "sorry?" Ma vaffanculo! 
 You bet all the money.



I'm sorry ,  you're not going to see 
 your mom again for a long time

because we're going to America.

Full house ,  boys. 
 - Whoa!

Yeah! 
 -Dio mio ,  grazie!



( Cursingln Swedish)



Come on. 
 - Figlio diputtana!

I'm going home! 
 - ( Cursing In Swedish)

I'm going home. 
 - I go to America.

Man: No ,  mate. Titanic 
 go to America in five minutes.



Come on. Come on. Here. 
 - Fabrizio: Andiamo.

We're riding in high style now. 
 We're a couple of regular swells.

We're practically goddamn royalty ,  
 ragazzo mio.

Fabrizio: 
 You see ,  it's my destino!

Like I told you ,  
 I go to America to be milionario.

Driver: Whoa ,  whoa! 
 - Bastardo!

You're pazzo! 
 - Maybe ,  but I've got the tickets.



Come on ,  I thought you were fast. 
 - Aspetta!

Wait ,  wait! Hey ,  wait!



We're passengers. Passengers.



Have you been through 
 the inspection queue?

Of course. 
 Anyway ,  we don't have any lice.

We're Americans ,  both of us. 
 - Right ,  come aboard.



We're the luckiest sons of bitches 
 in the world ,  you know that?

( Ship's Horn Blares)



Good-bye!



You know somebody? 
 - Of course not. That's not the point.

Good-bye! I'll miss you!

Good-bye! I'm going 
 to never forget you.

( Crowd Cheering)



All the way ,  darling.



360 ,  360.

Excuse me ,  ma'am.



Oh ,  right here. 
 Hey ,  how you doing?

Jack. Nice to meet you.

I'm Jack Dawson. 
 Nice to meet you.

How you doing? 
 Who says you get the top bunk?



( Speaking Swedish)



This is your private 
 promenade deck ,  sir.

Would you be 
 requiring anything?

Hmm. 
 - Excuse me.

Woman: This one? 
 - Rose: No. It had a lot of faces on it.

This is the one.



Would you like 
 all of them out ,  miss?

Yes ,  we need a little color 
 in this room.



Put it in there ,  
 in the wardrobe.



God ,  not those finger paintings again. 
 They certainly were a waste of money.



The difference between Cal's taste 
 in art and mine is that I have some.

They're fascinating ,  like being 
 inside a dream or something.

There's truth ,  but no logic. 
 - What's the artist's name?

Something Picasso. 
 - "Something Picasso."

He won't amount to a thing. 
 He won't ,  trust me.

Put the Degas in the bedroom. 
 - At least they were cheap.

Ah ,  put it in the wardrobe.



At Cherbourg ,  a woman came 
 aboard named Margaret Brown.

We all called her Molly.

History would call her 
 "the Unsinkable Molly Brown. "

Well ,  I wasn't about to wait 
 all day for you ,  sonny.

Here ,  you think you can manage?

Her husband had struck gold 
 some place out West

and she was what mother called 
 "new money. "

By the next afternoon ,  we were steaming 
 west from the coast of Ireland

with nothing out ahead of us 
 but ocean.



Take her to sea ,  Mr. Murdoch.



Let's stretch her legs. 
 - Yes ,  sir.



All ahead full ,  Mr. Moody. 
 - Very good ,  sir.

( Bells Ringing) 
 - ( Bell Rings)



All ahead full. 
 - Man ( Shouting): All ahead full!

Come on ,  lads. Get moving.



What's the reading?

( Crew Talking And Shouting)



All right ,  
 let's stoke them right up!

We're going full ahead!



21 knots ,  sir.



Hey ,  look ,  look ,  look! 
 Look ,  look!



See it?



There's another one. See him?



Look at that one. 
 Look at him jump!



Whoo-hoo!



Whoo!

I can see the 
 Statue of Liberty already!

Very small ,  of course.



I'm the king of the world!

( Whooping And Yelling)



( Whooping)



Man: She's the largest 
 moving object ever made

by the hand of man 
 in all history.

And our master ship builder ,  
 Mr. Andrews here

designed her 
 from the keel plates up.

Well ,  I may have 
 knocked her together

but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

He envisioned a steamer so grand 
 in scale and so luxurious

in its appointments that its 
 supremacy would never be challenged.

And here she is 
 willed in to solid reality.

Man: 
 Hear ,  hear.



You know I don't 
 like that ,  Rose.



She knows.



We'll both have the lamb ,  rare ,  
 with very little mint sauce.

Hmm ,  you like lamb ,  
 right ,  sweet pea?



Are you going to cut her meat 
 for her ,  too ,  there ,  Cal?



Hey ,  uh ,  who thought 
 of the name "Titanic"?

Was it you ,  Bruce? 
 - Well ,  yes ,  actually.

I wanted to convey sheer size 
 and the size means stability

Luxury ,  and above all ,  
 strength.



Do you know of Dr. Freud ,  
 Mr. Ismay?

His ideas about the male 
 preoccupation with size



might be of particular 
 interest to you.

What's gotten into you? 
 - Excuse me.



I do apologize. 
 - She's a pistol ,  Cal.

Hope you can handle her. 
 - Well ,  I may have to start minding...

what she reads from now on ,  
 won't I ,  Mrs. Brown?

Freud-- Who is he? 
 Is he a passenger?



( Man Explaining Propeller 
 To Little Girl)



It makes these waves ,  
 makes them spin.



Fabrizio: 
 The ship is nice ,  huh?

Yeah ,  it's an Irish ship. 
 - Is English ,  no?

No ,  it was built in Ireland. 
 15 , 000 Irishmen built this ship.

Solid as a rock. 
 Big Irish hands.

That's typical. First-class dogs 
 come down here to take a shit.

Uh ,  it lets us know where we rank 
 in the scheme of things.

Like we could forget?

I'm Tommy Ryan. 
 -Jack Dawson.

Hello. 
 - Fabrizio.

Hi. Do you make any money 
 with your drawings?



Oh ,  forget it ,  boyo. You'd as like 
 have angels fly out your ass

as get next 
 to the likes of her.



( Laughs)



Do you mind? 
 - I hope you're proud of this.



I saw my whole life 
 as if I'd already lived it--

an endless parade 
 of parties and cotillions



yachts and polo matches

always the same narrow people ,  
 the same mind less chatter.

I felt like I was standing 
 at a great precipice

with no one to pull me back



no one who cared 
 or even noticed.



( Woman Grunts) 
 - ( Rose Sobbing)



( Running Feet And Sobbing)



( Taking Short ,  
 Anxious Breaths)

Don't do it.

Stay back.



Don't come any closer.

Come on. Just give me your hand. 
 I'll pull you back over.

No! Stay where you are. 
 I mean it.

I'll let go.



No ,  you won't.

What do you mean ,  no ,  I won't?

Don't presume to tell me what I will 
 and will not do. You don't know me.

Well ,  you would have 
 done it already.

You're distracting me. 
 Go away.

I can't. I'm involved now.

You let go and I'm going to have to 
 jump in there after you. 



Don't be absurd. 
 You'll be killed.

I'm a good swimmer. 
 - The fall alone would kill you.



It would hurt. 
 - I'm not saying it wouldn't.

To tell you the truth 
 I'm a lot more concerned

about that water being so cold.

( Shoe Drops To Deck)



How cold? 
 - Freezing.

Maybe a couple degrees over.



You ever ,  uh...

ever been to Wisconsin?



What?

Well ,  they have some 
 of the coldest winters around.

I grew up there 
 near Chippewa Falls.

I remember when I was a kid ,  
 me and my father ,  we went ice fishing



out on Lake Wissota.



Ice fishing is ,  you know ,  
 where you--

( Angrily): 
 I know what ice fishing is!

Sorry.

You just seem like ,  you know ,  
 kind of an indoor girl.

Anyway ,  I ,  uh... 

I fell through some thin ice

and I'm telling you...

water that cold ,  
 like right down there

it hits you like a thousand knives 
 stabbing you all over your body.

You can't breathe ,  
 you can't think--



at least not about anything 
 but the pain.



Which is why I'm not looking forward 
 to jumping in there after you.

Like I said...

I don't have a choice.



I guess I'm kind of hoping 
 you'll come back over the rail

and get me off the hook here.

You're crazy.

That's what everybody says ,  
 but with all due respect ,  miss

I'm not the one hanging off 
 the back of a ship here.



Come on.

Come on ,  give me your hand. 
 You don't want to do this.



Whew!

I'm Jack Dawson.



Rose Dewitt Bukater.

I'm going to have to get you 
 to write that one down.



Come on.

( Screams) 
 - ( Grunting)

I got you! Come on.

Come on!



( Screams) 
 Help! Please!



Help! Please!



Please get me! 
 - Listen. Listen to me.

I've got you. I won't let go. 
 Now pull yourself up. Come on.

( Grunts)

Come on. That's right.

You can do it.



I got you.



What's all this?



You stand back! 
 And don't move an inch!

Fetch the master-at-arms! 
 - Care for a brandy?

Cal: This is completely unacceptable! 
 What made you think

that you could put your hands 
 on my fianc√©e?



Look at me ,  you filth! 
 - Cal...

What do you think you were doing? 
 - Cal ,  stop.



It was an accident. 
 - An accident?

It was. Stupid really.

I was leaning over ,  
 and I slipped.



I was leaning far over 
 to see the ,  uh...

uh... uh... 
 the ,  uh... uh...

Propellers? 
 - propellers and I slipped.

And I would have gone overboard 
 but Mr. Dawson here saved me

and almost went over himself.

You wanted to see... 
 She wanted to see the propellers.

Like I said ,  
 women and machinery do not mix.

Was that the way of it?



Yeah. Yeah ,  
 that was pretty much it.

Well ,  the boy's a hero then. 
 Good for you ,  son. Well done.

So it's all's well 
 and back to our brandy ,  eh?

Look at you. You must be freezing. 
 Let's get you inside.

Perhaps a little something 
 for the boy.



Of course. Mr. Lovejoy ,  
 I think a 20 should do it.

Is that the going rate 
 for saving the woman you love?



Rose is displeased. 
 What to do?



I know.



Perhaps you could join us 
 for dinner tomorrow evening

to regale our group 
 with...your heroic tale.



Sure ,  count me in.

Good. Settled then.

This should be interesting. Mmm.



( Whistles)



Can l ,  uh... bum a smoke?



You'll want to tie those.



It's interesting.

The young lady slips so suddenly 
 and you still had time

to remove your jacket 
 and your shoes.



( Music Box Playing Tune) 
 - ( Knock At Door)

( Door Opens)



I know you've been melancholy.

I don't pretend to know why.



I intended to save this

until the engagement gala

next week.

But I thought tonight.



Good gracious.

Perhaps as a reminder 
 of my feelings for you.

Is it a... 
 - Diamond? Yes.



56 carats to be exact.



It was worn by Louis XVI

and they called it 
 "Le Coeur De La Mer. "

Both: 
 The Heart of the Ocean.

Yes.



It's overwhelming.

Well ,  it's for royalty.

We are royalty ,  Rose.



You know ,  there's nothing 
 I couldn't give you.

There's nothing I'd deny you

if you would not deny me.



Now open your heart 
 to me ,  Rose.



Jack: Well ,  I've been on my own since 
 I was 1 5 since my folks died.



And I had no 
 brothers or sisters

or close kin in that part 
 of the country.

So I lit on out of there 
 and I haven't been back since.

You could just call me 
 a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.



Well ,  Rose...

we've walked about a mile 
 around this boat deck

and chewed over how great 
 the weather's been and how I grew up

but I reckon that's not why 
 you came to talk to me ,  is it?



Mr. Dawson ,  l-- 
 -Jack.

Jack...

I want to thank you 
 for what you did.

Not just for... for pulling me back 
 but for your discretion.



You're welcome.

Look ,  I know 
 what you must be thinking.

Poor little rich girl. 
 What does she know about misery?

No. No ,  that's not what 
 I was thinking.



What I was thinking was 
 what could have happened to this girl

to make her think 
 she had no way out?



Well ,  l--

It was everything.

It was my whole world 
 and all the people in it

and the inertia of my life 
 plunging ahead

and me ,  powerless to stop it.

God! Look at that thing.

You would have gone 
 straight to the bottom.



500 invitations have gone out.

All of Philadelphia society 
 will be there

and all the while 
 I feel I'm...

standing in the middle 
 of a crowded room

screaming at the top of my lungs 
 and no one even looks up.



Do you love him?

Pardon me? 
 - Do you love him?

You're being very rude. 
 You shouldn't be asking me this.

Well ,  it's a simple question. 
 Do you love the guy or not?



This is not 
 a suitable conversation.

-Why can't you just answer the question? 
 -( Nervous Laughter)

This is absurd. You don't know me ,  
 and I don't know you

and we are not having 
 this conversation at all.

You are rude and uncouth 
 and presumptuous and I am leaving now.



Jack. Mr. Dawson ,  
 it's been a pleasure.

I sought you out to thank you 
 and now I have thanked you...

And you've insulted me. 
 - Well ,  you deserved it.

Right. 
 - Right.



I thought you were leaving. 
 - I am.



You are so annoying.

( Chuckles) 
 - Wait.

I don't have to leave. 
 This is my part of the ship. You leave.

Oh-ho-ho ,  
 well ,  well ,  well.

Now who's being rude?



What is this stupid thing 
 you're carrying around?



So what are you ,  
 an artist or something?



Well ,  these are rather good.



They're ,  uh-- 
 They're very good actually.



Jack ,  this is exquisite work.

They didn't think too much 
 of them in old Paree.

Paris! You do get around 
 for a poor--



Well ,  uh ,  uh ,  a person 
 of limited means.

Go on ,  a poor guy ,  
 you can say it.



Well ,  well ,  well.



And these were drawn from life?



Well ,  that's one 
 of the good things about Paris--



Lots of girls willing 
 to take their clothes off.



You liked this woman.

You used her several times.

Well ,  she had beautiful hands ,  
 you see?



I think you must have had 
 a love affair with her.

No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no. 
 Just with her hands.



She was a one-legged prostitute.

See?



( Aghast): Oh! 
 - ( Both Chuckle)

Ah ,  she had a good sense 
 of humor ,  though.



Oh ,  and this lady...

she used to sit 
 at this bar every night



wearing every piece 
 of jewelry she owned

just waiting 
 for her long-lost love.



Called her Madame Bijou.

See how her clothes 
 are all moth-eaten?

Well ,  you have a gift ,  Jack.

You do. You see people.

I see you.



And?

You wouldn't have jumped.



But the purpose of university 
 is to find a suitable husband.

Rose has already done that.

Look ,  here comes 
 that vulgar Brown woman.

Quickly ,  get up 
 before she sits with us.

Hello ,  girls. I was hoping 
 I'd catch you at tea.

We're awfully sorry 
 you missed it.

The countess and I were just off 
 to take the air on the boat deck.

What a lovely idea. 
 I need to catch up on my gossip.



Molly: 
 Countess.

So you've not yet 
 lit the last four boilers?

No ,  I don't see the need. 
 We are making excellent time.

The press knows 
 the size of Titanic.

Now I want them to marvel 
 at her speed.

We must give them 
 something new to print.



This maiden voyage of Titanic 
 must make headlines.

Mr. Ismay ,  I would prefer 
 not to push the engines

until they've been 
 properly run in.

Of course 
 I'm just a passenger.

I leave it to your good offices 
 to decide what's best.

But what a glorious end 
 to your final crossing

if we were to get into New York 
 on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

Make the morning papers. 
 Retire with a bang ,  eh ,  E.J.?



Good man.

Well ,  after that I worked on 
 a squid boat in Monterey.

Then I went down to Los Angeles 
 to the pier in Santa Monica

and started doing portraits there 
 for ten cents a piece.

Why can't I be like you ,  Jack-- 
 just head out for the horizon

whenever I feel like it?

Say we'll go there 
 sometime to that pier

even if we only 
 ever just talk about it.

No ,  we'll do it.

We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride 
 on the roller coaster till we throw up.

Then we'll ride horses on the beach 
 right in the surf.

But you'll have to do it like a real 
 cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.

You mean ,  one leg on each side? 
 - Yeah.

Can you show me? 
 - Sure... if you like.



Teach me to ride like a man. 
 - And chew tobacco like a man.

And spit like a man.

They didn't teach you that 
 in finishing school?

No. 
 - Well ,  come on ,  I'll show you.

Let's do it. 
 I'll show you how. Come on.

Jack ,  no! Jack ,  no!

Wait ,  Jack. No ,  Jack. 
 I couldn't possibly ,  Jack.

Watch closely.



That's disgusting! 
 - All right ,  your turn.



That was pitiful!

Come on ,  you really got 
 to hawk it back ,  you know?

Get some leverage to it. 
 Use your arms ,  arc your neck.

( Hawks)

See the range on that thing? 
 - Mm-hmm.

( Rose Hawking) 
 -Jack: Okay ,  go.

( Hawks)



-That was better. You got to work on it. 
 -Really?

Really try and hawk it up 
 and get some body to it ,  you know?

You got to... 
 ( Snorting)



( Swallows)

Mother.



May I introduce Jack Dawson?

Charmed ,  I'm sure.



The others were gracious 
 and curious

about the man 
 who had saved my life

but m ymother looked at him 
 like an insect--

a dangerous insect 
 which must be squashed quickly.

Well ,  Jack ,  sounds like you're a good 
 man to have around in a sticky spot.

( Trumpet Playing Fanfare)

Why do they always insist on announcing 
 dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

( Laughs) 
 - Shall we go to dress ,  Mother?

See you at dinner ,  Jack.



Uh ,  son? Son!

Do you have the slightest comprehension 
 what you're doing?

Not really.

Well ,  you're about to go 
 into the snake pit.



What are you planning to wear?



I figured. Come on.



I was right.

You and my son 
 are just about the same size.

Pretty close.



( Whistles) 
 - You shine up like a new penny.

( Laughs)



Good evening ,  sir.



( Orchestra Playing 
 "On The Beautiful Blue Danube")



Good evening.



Man: 
 Hello.



Cal: Do you know that there are 
 several thousand tons

of Hockley steel 
 in this very ship?

Ruth: Hmm. Which part? 
 - Cal: All the right ones ,  of course.

Then we'll know who to hold 
 accountable if there's a problem.

Where's my daughter? 
 - Oh ,  she'll be along.

There is the countess. 
 - Hello ,  my dear.

Good evening ,  Cal. 
 - Cal: So good to see you.



I saw that in a nickelodeon once 
 and I always wanted to do it.



( Snickers)



Ruth: 
 I'll see you at dinner.

Darling? Surely 
 you remember Mr. Dawson.

Dawson? 
 ( Chuckles)

Well ,  it's amazing. 
 You could almost pass for a gentleman.

Almost. 
 - Extraordinary.



Ruth: 
 My dear ,  it's delightful to see you.

What a remarkable 
 voyage this is.

It's mad ,  isn't it? 
 - Ruth: I love your perfume.

There's the Countess of Rothes.



And ,  um ,  that's John Jacob Astor-- 
 the richest man on the ship.

His little wife there ,  Madeleine ,  
 is my age and in delicate condition.

See how she's 
 trying to hide it?

Quite the scandal. 
 - Hmm.

And that's Benjamin Guggenheim 
 and his mistress Madame Aubert.

Mrs. Guggenheim is at home 
 with the children ,  of course.

And over here we have 
 Sir Cosmo and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

She designs naughty lingerie ,  
 among her many talents.

Very popular with the royals.

Congratulations ,  Hockley. 
 She's splendid.

Why ,  thank you.

Care to escort a lady to dinner? 
 - Certainly.

( Chuckling) 
 - Sweat pea?

Cal: Sweet pea. 
 - Ain't nothin' to it ,  is there ,  Jack?

Remember ,  they love money ,  so just 
 pretend like you own a gold mine...

and you're in the club.



Hey ,  Astor! 
 - Well ,  hello ,  Molly. Nice to see you.

J.J. Madeleine ,  
 I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

How Do you do? 
 - Pleasure.

Hello ,  Jack. 
 Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons ,  
 actually.

Oh ,  yes. Yes.



He must have been nervous ,  
 but he never faltered.

They assumed 
 he was one of them--

Heir to a rail road fortune ,  
 perhaps.

New money ,  obviously ,  
 but still a member of the club.

Mother ,  of course ,  
 could always be counted upon.

Tell us of the accommodations 
 in steerage ,  Mr. Dawson.

I hear they're quite good 
 on this ship.

The best I've seen ,  ma'am. 
 Hardly any rats.

( Laughter)

Mr. Dawson is joining us 
 from the third class.

He was of some assistance 
 to my fianc√©e last night.

It turns out that Mr. Dawson 
 is quite a fine artist.

He was kind enough to show me 
 some of his work today.

Rose and I differ somewhat 
 in our definition off art.

Not to impugn your work ,  sir.



( Clears Throat)



Ismay: 
 She may be mine on paper

but in the eyes of God ,  
 she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

( Whispering): 
 Are these all for me?

Just start from the outside 
 and work your way in.

He knows every rivet 
 in her ,  don't you ,  Thomas?

Your ship is a wonder ,  truly. 
 - Thank you ,  Rose.



And how Do you take your caviar ,  sir? 
 - No caviar for me ,  thanks.

Never did like it much.



And where ,  exactly ,  
 Do you live ,  Mr. Dawson?

Well ,  right now ,  my address 
 is the R.M.S. Titanic.

After that ,  
 I'm on God's good humor.



And how is it 
 you have means to travel?

I work my way 
 from place to place--

You know ,  
 tramp steamers and such.

But I won my ticket 
 on Titanic here

at a lucky hand at poker.

A very lucky hand.

All life is a game of luck. 
 - Mmm.

A real man makes 
 his own luck ,  Archie.

Right ,  Dawson? 
 - Mmm.

And you find that sort of 
 rootless existence appealing ,  Do you?



Well ,  yes ,  ma'am ,  I do.

I mean ,  got everything I need 
 right here with me.

Got air in my lungs 
 and a few blank sheets of paper.

I mean ,  I love waking up in the morning 
 not knowing what's going to happen

or who I'm going to meet ,  
 where I'm going to wind up.

Just the other night ,  I was sleeping 
 under a bridge ,  and now here I am

on the grandest ship in the world 
 having champagne with you fine people.

( Laughter) 
 - I'll take some more of that.

I figure life's a gift ,  
 and I don't intend on wasting it.

You never know what hand 
 you're going to get dealt next.

You learn to take life 
 as it comes at you. Here you go ,  Cal.

To make each day count.

Well said ,  Jack. 
 - Hear ,  hear!

To making it count.



All: To making it count. 
 - Archie: Bravo.



( Molly Laughing)

Mr. Brown had no idea 
 I'd hidden the money in the stove.

( Laughter)

So he comes home drunk as a pig ,  
 celebrating and he lights a fire.

( Laughter)

( Softly): Next it'll be 
 brandies in the smoking room.

Archie: 
 Well ,  join me in a brandy ,  gentlemen?

( Men Agree)

Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke 
 and congratulate each other

on being masters of the universe.

Ladies ,  thank you for 
 the pleasure of your company.

Rose ,  may I escort you 
 back to the cabin?

No ,  I'll stay here. 
 - Here you go ,  Molly.



Archie: 
 Joining us ,  Dawson?

You don't want to stay out here 
 with the women ,  Do you?

No ,  thanks. 
 I've got to be heading back.

Ah. 
 - Probably best.

It'll be all business 
 and politics ,  that sort of thing--

Wouldn't interest you.

But Dawson ,  good of you to come.



Jack ,  must you go?

Time for me to go row 
 with the other slaves.



Good night ,  Rose.



( Clock Begins Chiming)

( Sighs)



So you want to go 
 to a real party?

( Drums Pounding ,  Men Whooping) 
 - ( Playing Lively Tune)



Is okay I put my hand here? Okay.



Tal la frikken svenska? 
 - What?

( Repeats Phrase)

I can't understand you.



( Glass Shatters)



Hey! Bravo ,  bravo!

Thank you. Come on ,  guys. 
 - Let's go!

I'm going to dance 
 with her now ,  all right?

Come on. 
 - What?



Come with me. 
 - What? Jack--Jack ,  wait!

( Band Playing At Fast Tempo) 
 - I can't do this.

We're going to have to 
 get a little bit closer.

Like this.

( Pipes And Drums Playing Dance Tune) 
 - You're still my best girl ,  Cora.



I don't know the steps. 
 - Neither do l.

Just go with it. 
 Don't think.

( Laughing) 
 - Hey.



( Rose Squealing With Delight)



Wait ,  Jack ,  Jack! 
 Wait! Stop ,  Jack!



Ba-ba-ba. 
 - ( Dancers Whooping)



Rose: Wait! 
 - Hey! Hey!



( Whooping)



-Jack: Yeah! 
 -Jack ,  no!

Whaaa!



( Squeals ,  Giggling)



...jurisdiction of the Sherman Act 
 so my lawyers will argue.



That's what Rockefeller said ,  but 
 the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

( Men Shouting And Cheering ,  
 Drums And Pipes Playing)



What? You think 
 a first-class girl can't drink?



( Squeals) 
 - Get out of here.



You all right? 
 - ( Laughing)

I'm fine. 
 - ( Growls)

Two out of three ,  
 two out of three.

So...

you think you're 
 big ,  tough men?

Let's see you do this.



Hold this for me ,  Jack. 
 Hold it up.



Ow! 
 ( Laughing)

-Jesus ,  Mary and Joseph! 
 - You all right?

I haven't done that in years.



Go see Maggie ,  lads. 
 Give her the holley! Let's go!

Musicians: 
 Ho!



Coffee ,  sir?



I had hoped you would 
 come to me last night.



I was tired.



Your exertions below decks 
 were no doubt exhausting.



I see you had that undertaker 
 of a manservant follow me. How typical.

You will never behave like that 
 again ,  Rose. Do you understand?



I'm not a foreman in one 
 of your mills that you can command.

I'm your fianc√©e.



My fianc√©e? 
 My fianc√©e?!!

Yes ,  you are ,  and my wife!



My wife in practice if not yet by law ,  
 so you will honor me.

You will honor me the way a wife 
 is required to honor a husband.

Because I will not be 
 made out a fool ,  Rose.

Is this in anyway unclear?

No. 
 - Good.

Excuse me.



Miss Rose!



We had a little... accident. 
 - That's all right ,  Miss Rose.

That's all right. 
 - I'm sorry ,  Trudy.

Let me help you. 
 It's all right ,  miss.



It's all right ,  miss.



Tea ,  Trudy. 
 - Yes ,  ma'am.



You're not to see that boy again ,  
 Do you understand me?

Rose ,  I forbid it. 
 - Oh ,  stop it ,  Mother.

You'll give yourself 
 a nosebleed.

This is not a game.

Our situation is precarious. 
 You know the money's gone.

Of course I know it's gone.

You remind me every day.

Your father left us nothing but a legacy 
 of bad debts hidden by a good name.

That name is the only card 
 we have to play.

I don't understand you. 
 It is a fine match with Hockley.

It will ensure our survival. 
 - How can you put this on my shoulders?



Why are you being so selfish? 
 - I'm being selfish?

 

Do you want to see me 
 working as a seamstress?



Is that what you want?



To see our fine things 
 sold at auction?



Our memories 
 scattered to the winds?



( Sighs) 
 It's so unfair.



Of course it's unfair.

We're women.



Our choices are never easy.



Hmm?



Congregation: 
 ** Protect them by Thy guardian hand **

** From every peril 
 on the land. **

** O spirit ,

**To spread across

** O wind of heaven ,

** Save all who dare

**And keep them

Hello ,  Mr. Andrews. 
 - Hello ,  Jack.



Sir. 
 - I need to talk to somebody for a sec.

You're not supposed 
 to be in here.

** ...fire and foe 
 Protect them... **

I was just here last night. 
 You don't remember me?

No ,  I'm afraid I don't. 
 Now you're going to have to turn around.

He'll tell you. 
 I just-- I just need--

Mr. Hockley 
 and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

continue to be appreciative 
 of your assistance.

They asked me to ,  uh... 
 give you this in gratitude.

I don't want your money. Please ,  l-- 
 - And also to remind you...

that you hold 
 a third-class ticket

and that your presence here 
 is no longer appropriate.

Please ,  I just want 
 to speak to Rose for--

Gentlemen ,  will you please see that 
 Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

and that he stays there?

Yes ,  sir. 
 Come along ,  you.



** Oh ,  hear us 
 when we cry to Thee **

** For those in peril 
 on the sea. **

Ruth: And why Do you have 
 two steering wheels?

We really only use 
 this near shore.

Excuse me ,  sir. Another ice warning. 
 This one's from the Noordam.



Thank you ,  Sparks.



Oh ,  not to worry. 
 Quite normal for this time of year.

In fact ,  we're speeding up.

I've just ordered 
 the last boilers lit.



Man: Okay ,  son ,  
 wind it up tight like I showed you.

Okay ,  now ,  let it go.



Was good ,  wasn't it? 
 - Quite nice.

That's excellent ,  son.



Rose: 
 Mr. Andrews ,  forgive me...

I did the sum in my head 
 and with the number of lifeboats

times the capacity you mentioned

forgive me ,  but it seems that there 
 are not enough for everyone aboard.

About half ,  actually.

Rose ,  you miss nothing ,  Do you? 
 In fact ,  I put in these new type davits

which can take an extra row 
 of boats inside this one



but it was thought by some 
 that the deck would look too cluttered

so I was overruled.

Waste of deck space as it is 
 on an unsinkable ship.

Sleep soundly ,  young Rose. I have built 
 you a good ship ,  strong and true.

She's all the lifeboat you need.

Just keep heading aft. 
 The next stop will be the engine room.

Come on.



Jack ,  this is impossible. 
 I can't see you.

I need to talk to you. 
 - No ,  Jack ,  no.

Jack ,  I'm engaged.

I'm marrying Cal. 
 I love Cal.



Rose ,  you're no picnic.

All right ,  you're a spoiled 
 little brat ,  even

but under that you're the most 
 amazingly astounding



wonderful girl-- woman-- 
 that I've ever known and...

-Jack ,  l... 
 - No ,  let me try and get this out.

You're , you're ama--

I'm not an idiot. 
 I know how the world works.



I've got ten bucks 
 in my pocket.



I have nothing to offer you 
 and I know that.

I understand.

But I'm too involved now. 
 You jump ,  I jump ,  remember?

I can't turn away 
 without knowing you'll be all right.

That's all that I want.

Well ,  I'm fine.

I'll be fine ,  really.

Really?



I don't think so. 
 They've got you trapped ,  Rose



and you're going to die 
 if you don't break free--

Maybe not right away 
 because you're strong ,  but

sooner or later that fire 
 that I love about you ,  Rose...

that fire is going to burn out.



It's not up to you 
 to save me , Jack.



You're right. 
 Only you can do that.



I'm going back. 
 Leave me alone.



Countess: Tell Lucille about the 
 disaster you had with the stationer's.

Well ,  of course ,  the invitations 
 had to be sent back twice.

Oh ,  my dear! 
 - And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

Let me tell you what an odyssey 
 that has been.

Rose decided 
 she wanted lavender.

She knows I detest the color ,  
 so she did it only to spite me.

Lucille: 
 If only you'd come to me sooner.

Ruth saw some of my designs 
 in "La Mode Illustree."

They were for Trousseau of the Duchess 
 of Malborough's youngest daughter.

Theyw ere quite charming ,  but I think 
 you'll agree ,  my dear ,  that together

we've created something of a phoenix 
 from the ashes.

( Women Laugh Politely)



Hello , Jack.



I changed my mind.



They said you might be-- 
 - Shh.



Give me your hand.



Now close your eyes.

Go on.



Step up.



Now hold on to the railing.

Keep your eyes closed ,  don't peek. 
 - I'm not.



Step up onto the rail.



Hold on. Hold on. 
 Keep your eyes closed.

( Giggles) 
 - Do you trust me?

I trust you.



All right ,  open your eyes.



I'm flying! Jack!



( Softly): 
 ** Come , Josephine ,  my flying machine **

** Going up ,  she goes **

** Up ,  she goes... **



That was the last time Titanic 
 ever saw daylight.

So we're up to dusk 
 the night of the sinking.

Six hours to go. 
 - Incredible.

There's Smith and he's standing there 
 and he's got the iceberg warning...

in his fucking hand-- excuse me-- 
 his hand ,  and he's ordering more speed.

26years of experience 
 working against him.

He figures anything big enough 
 to sink the ship

they're going to see 
 in time to turn

but the ship's too big 
 with too small a rudder.

Doesn't corner worth a damn.

Everything he knows is wrong.



( Laughing) 
 It's quite proper ,  I assure you.

This is the sitting room.

Will this light do? 
 - What?

Don't artists need good light?

( In French Accent): 
 That is true

but I'm not used to working 
 in such horrible conditions.

Monet!

Do you know his work? 
 - Of course.

Look at his use of color here. 
 Isn't he great?

I know ,  it's extraordinary.



Cal insists on carting 
 this hideous thing everywhere.

Should we be expecting him 
 anytime soon?

Not as long as the cigars 
 and brandy hold out.



That's nice. 
 - What is it ,  a sapphire?

A diamond ,  
 a very rare diamond.



Jack ,  I want you to draw me like one 
 of your French girls... wearing this.

All right.

Wearing only this.



The last thing I need 
 is another picture of me

Looking like a porcelain doll.



As a paying customer...



I expect to get what I want.



Over on the bed-- 
 the couch.



Go... Lie down.



Tell me when it looks right. 
 - Put your arm back the way it was.

Right.

Put that other arm up ,  
 that hand right by your face there.



Right.



Now ,  head down.



Eyes to me ,  
 keep them on me.



And try to stay still.



( Exhales)



So serious.



I believe you are blushing ,  
 Mr. Big Artiste.



I can't imagine 
 Monsieur Monet blushing.

He does landscapes. 
 Just relax your face.

Sorry. 
 - No laughing.

( Exhales)



My heart was pounding 
 the whole time.

It was the most erotic moment 
 of my life.



Up until then ,  at least.

So what happened next? 
 - You mean ,  did we do it?



Sorry ,  to disappoint you ,  
 Mr. Bodine.

Jack was very professional.



Thank you.



( Rose Laughing)



What you doing?

Will you put this back 
 in the safe for me?



Mm-hmm.



Would you excuse me?



None of the stewards have seen her. 
 - This is absurd.

It's a ship ,  there's only 
 so many places she could be.

Lovejoy ,  find her.



Clear. 
 - Yes.

I don't think I've ever seen 
 such a flat calm.

Like a mill pond. 
 Not a breath of wind.

It will make the bergs 
 harder to see

with no breaking water 
 at the base.

Hmm.



Well ,  I'm off. Maintain speed 
 and heading ,  Mr. Lightoller.

Yes ,  sir.



It's getting cold. 
 You look nice.

( Knock At Door) 
 - Lovejoy: Miss Rose?

My drawings!



( Door Closes)



Come on!



No ,  wait ,  wait! 
 - Wait ,  wait ,  wait!

Go ,  go! Down ,  down!

Rose: 
 Quickly ,  quickly!



( Giggling) 
 Bye!



Sorry! 
 - ( Giggling)



It's all right! 
 - ( Laughing)



Pretty tough for a valet ,  
 this fellow.

Seems more like a cop. 
 - I think he was.

-Jack: Oh ,  shit. 
 - ( Rose Screams)



No ,  over here!

Quick!



( Boiler Blasting)

Now what?! 
 - What?!



Hold up! What're you two 
 doing down here?

You shouldn't be down here! 
 It could be dangerous!



Jack: Carry on! Don't mind us. 
 You're doing a great job!

Keep up the good work!



Ah ,  look what 
 we have here ,  huh?



( Rose Clears Throat)



Thank you.



( Honks Horn) 
 - Where to ,  miss?

To the stars.



You nervous?



No.



Put your hands on me , Jack.



Crewman: 
 God ,  it's bloody cold.

You know ,  I can smell ice ,  
 you know ,  when it's near.

Bollocks. 
 - But I can ,  all right!

Murdoch: Did you ever find 
 those binoculars for the lookouts?

Haven't seen them 
 since Southampton.

Well ,  I'll be on my rounds. 
 Cheerio.



You're trembling.



Don't worry. 
 I'll be all right.



They ran down there. 
 - Right.



Lovejoy: 
 Anything missing?



I've got a better idea.



Gotcha!



( Rose Laughing)



( Laughing)

Did you see those guys' faces?

Did you see the...



When the ship docks...

I'm getting off with you.

This is crazy.

I know. 
 It doesn't make any sense.



That's why I trust it.



( Quietly): 
 Oh , yes. Here ,  look at this.



Oh ,  look at that ,  would you?

They're a bit warmer than we are. 
 - Well ,  if that's what it takes

for us to get warmer I'd rather not ,  
 if it's all the same to you.



Bugger me! 
 - ( Alarm Bell Clanging)



( Phone Rings) 
 - Pick up , you bastards!

( Phone Ringing)

Is there anyone there? 
 - Yes ,  what Do you see?

Iceberg! Right ahead! 
 - Thank you.

Iceberg! Right ahead! 
 Hard to starboard!

Crewman: 
 Hard to starboard!



( Ringing) 
 - Crewman: Turn ,  turn! Steady!



( Ringing) 
 - ( Bell Clangs )

Full astern!



Hard over. 
 - Helm's hard over ,  sir.



( Ringing) 
 - Go ,  lads! Go!



( Men Yelling Out Orders)



Shut all the dampers! 
 Shut them!

( Dampers Slamming)



Hold it.

Hold it!

Now ,  engage 
 the reversing engine!



( Engine Stops)



( Engine Restarts)



Why aren't they turning?!

Is it hard over?! 
 - Crewman: It is , yes ,  sir ,  hard over!



( Softly): 
 Come on ,  come on ,  come on.

Turn.



Yes.



It's going to hit!



Jesus Christ.



( Glass Tinkling)



( Softly):Jesus. 
 - Hard to port!

Crewman: 
 Hard to port!



( Men Screaming)



Get back!



( Screaming)



( Hissing) 
 - ( Screams)



( Metal Doors Closing) 
 - Come on ,  let's go!

Get out the door! 
 They're closing the doors! Get out!

Get out! Get out! Get out!



Get out the door! Go on!

Go on! Come on ,  lads! 
 Go ,  lads ,  go!



Get out!



( Screams)

( Doors Slamming)



( Softly): Oh ,  my God. 
 That was a close shave ,  weren't it?

Smell ice ,  can you? 
 Bleeding Christ.



Note the time 
 and enter it in the log.



What was that ,  Mr. Murdoch?

An iceberg ,  sir. 
 I put her hard to starboard

and ran the engines full astern 
 but it was too close.

I tried to port round it 
 but she hit and the...



Close the watertight doors. 
 - Murdoch: The doors are closed ,  sir.



All stop. 
 - Crewman: Aye ,  sir!



( Ringing)



Find the carpenter. 
 Get him to sound the ship.

Yes ,  sir!



Fabrizio: 
 Porcaputtana!

Che cazzo e?



Come on ,  let's get the hell 
 out of here! Come on ,  hurry up.



Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped? 
 I felt a shudder.

I shouldn't worry ,  madam. 
 We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

That's the shudder you felt. 
 May I bring you anything?

No ,  thank you.



Man: 
 Did you see anything?

Man: 
 I don't see anything now ,  Do you?

( Commotion)

If this is the direction the rats 
 are going that's good enough for me.



Crewman: Please ,  sir ,  please. 
 Everything's under control.



You there. 
 - Sir ,  there is no emergency.

Yes ,  there is ,  I have been robbed. 
 - Get the master-at-arms.

Now , you moron! 
 - Yes ,  sir.

( Men Laughing)



Hey , you're going to miss the fun. 
 Did you see what happened?

No ,  I missed it. 
 Apparently ,  it hit over there.

Crewman: Boiler room six 
 is flooded eight feet above the plate.

And the mail hold is worse. She's 
 all buckled in in the forward hold.

Can you shore up? 
 - Not unless the pumps get ahead.

Have you seen the damage 
 in the mail hold?

No ,  she's already underwater. 
 - This is bad.



We should tell 
 Mother and Cal.



I think they're very good ,  sir.



Don't touch anything. 
 I want the entire room photographed.

Rose: 
 Just keep holding my hand.



We've been looking 
 for you ,  miss.



Rose ( Sighs): 
 Well ,  here we go.



Something serious has happened.

Yes ,  it has.



Indeed. Two things dear to me 
 have disappeared this evening.

Now that one is back I have a pretty 
 good idea where to find the other.

Search him. 
 - Take your coat off ,  sir.

Now what? 
 - Come on.

Cal ,  what are you doing? We're in the 
 middle of an emergency. What's going on?

Is this it? 
 - That's it.

This is horse shit!

Don't you believe it ,  Rose. Don't! 
 - He couldn't have.

Of course he could. 
 It's easy enough for a professional.

But I was with him the whole time. 
 This is absurd.



Perhaps he did it while you were putting 
 your clothes back on ,  dear.

Real slick ,  Cal. 
 Rose ,  they put it in my pocket.



Shut up. 
 - It isn't even your pocket ,  is it ,  son?

Property of A. L. Ryerson.



That was reported stolen today. 
 - I just borrowed it.

I was going to return it. 
 - We have an honest thief here ,  do we?

You know I didn't do this ,  Rose. 
 You know it.

Don't you believe them ,  Rose. 
 You know I didn't do it.

Come on ,  let's go. 
 - You know I didn't do it ,  Rose. Rose!

Come on ,  son. 
 There's a good lad.

Come on. 
 - You know I didn't do it! You know me!



Ismay: 
 Most unfortunate ,  Captain.



Water... 1 4 feet above 
 the keel in ten minutes--

In the fore peak ,  in all three holds 
 and in the boiler room six.

That's right ,  sir. 
 - When can we get underway ,  damn it?

That's five compartments.



She can stay afloat with the first 
 four compartments breached

but not five-- not five.

As she goes down by the head 
 the water

will spill over the tops of bulkheads 
 at E deck from one to the next.

Back and back. 
 There's no stopping it.

The pumps-- 
 If we opened the doors--

The pumps buy you time ,  
 but minutes only.

From this moment ,  
 no matter what we do

Titanic will founder.



But this ship can't sink.

She's made of iron ,  sir. 
 I assure you ,  she can...

and she will.

It is a mathematical certainty.



How much time?



An hour. Two at most.



And how many aboard ,  
 Mr. Murdoch?

2 , 200 souls on board ,  sir.



Well ,  I believe you may get 
 your headlines ,  Mr. Ismay.



Oh ,  it is a little slut ,  isn't it? Will 
 you look at me when I'm talking to you.

( Knock A tDoor)

Mr. Hockley? 
 - Not now ,  we're busy.

Sir ,  I've been told to ask you to please 
 put on your life belts and come up to--

I said not now.

I'm sorry to inconvenience you ,  
 Mr. Hockley ,  but it's Captain's orders.

Now ,  please ,  dress warmly. 
 It's quite cold out tonight.

Now ,  may I suggest 
 topcoats and hats.

This is ridiculous. 
 - Not to worry ,  miss.

I am sure 
 it's just a precaution.

Everybody up! 
 Life belts on!

( Men Screaming Orders) 
 - What's he yelling about?



Everybody up! 
 Put your life belts on!



What's the ruckus? 
 -Just put your life belts on!

Crewman: 
 C.QD.?

Sir?



That's right-- C.Q D. 
 The distress call.

That's our position.



( Sighs)

Tell whoever responds 
 that we're going down by the head.

We need immediate assistance.



Blimey.



Keep lowering! 
 Keep lowering!



( Crewman Yelling Out Orders)



Mr. Wilde! Mr. Wilde ,  
 where are the passengers?

We moved them back inside. 
 It's too damn cold and noisy for them.

You there! 
 (Blows Whistle)

Get down here and 
 help with these lines.

( Orchestra Playing 
 "Alexander's Ragtime Band")



( People Conversing)



Care for a drink ,  sir?



Crewman: Please put your life belts on. 
 - Hey ,  sonny ,  what's doing?

You got us all trussed up here 
 and now we're cooling our heels.

Sorry ,  ma'am. 
 Let me go and find out.



I don't think anybody knows 
 what the hell's going on around here.

It's the goddamned English 
 doing everything by the book.

There's no need for language ,  
 Mr. Hockley.

Go back and turn 
 the heaters on in our rooms.

I'd like a cup of tea 
 when I return.

Yes ,  ma'am.



Mr. Andrews.



I saw the iceberg 
 and I see it in your eyes.

Please tell me the truth.



The ship will sink.

You're certain. 
 - Yes ,  in an hour or so....

all this will be 
 at the bottom of the Atlantic.

What? 
 - Please ,  tell only who you must?

I don't want to 
 be responsible for a panic

and get to a boat quickly ,  
 don't wait.

You remember what I told you 
 about the boats?



Yes.



I understand.



Over here ,  sir.

Sir ,  they need you 
 up in the second-class purser's office.

There's a big mob up there. 
 - Go on ,  I'll keep an eye on him.

Aye ,  right.



Sir! Carpathia says 
 they're making 1 7 knots.

Full steam for them ,  sir.



She's the only one responding?



The only one close ,  sir. 
 She says they can be here in four hours.

Four hours?



Thank you ,  Bride.



( Softly): 
 My God.

( Crewmen Yelling Out Orders)



Sir! We are swung out 
 and ready ,  sir.



Hadn't we better get the women 
 and children into the boat ,  sir?



Yes ,  we do. 
 - Sir?



Women and children first. Yes.

Yes ,  sir.



Crewman ( Yelling): Ladies 
 and gentlemen , your attention please!



Step this way ,  please. 
 That's right.

Come towards me.

Thank you. Good.

For the time being ,  I shall require 
 only women and children.

Man: 
 Right here.



All right ,  boys ,  
 like the captain said

nice and cheery 
 so there's no panic.

"Wedding Dance."

( Orchestra Begins Playing)



Life belts on! 
 Here ,  put your life belts on.

Put your life belts on. 
 Here ,  put your life belt on.

Here ,  come on ,  here.



( Commotion)

Crewman: It isn't time 
 to go up to the boats yet.

Please stay calm.

Look ,  please ,  make sure ,  everybody ,  
 you've got your life belts on

and gentlemen ,  allow the women 
 and children through to the front.

What are we doing ,  Mommy? 
 - We're just waiting ,  dear.



When they're finished putting 
 the first-class people in the boats...

they'll start with us and 
 we'll want to be all ready ,  won't we?

( Men Arguing)



Go and get some help.

Lower away! 
 Left and right together!

Steady! Both sides together.

Steady! Steady!

Steady!

Stop! Stop!



( Screaming) 
 - Hold the left side! Right side only!

Right side only! 
 Right side only!

Hold the left side! 
 Right side down!

Lower away together!



Steady ,  lads!



( Explosion)

( Passengers Gasp)



You know ,  I do believe 
 this ship may sink.

I've been asked to give you

this small token 
 of our appreciation.



Compliments of 
 Mr. Caledon Hockley.



Come on ,  sister , you heard 
 the man-- into the boat.

Any room for a gentleman ,  
 gentlemen?

Crewman: 
 Only women at this time ,  sir.



Will the lifeboats be seated 
 according to class?



I hope they're 
 not too crowded.

Oh ,  Mother ,  shut up!

Don't you understand? The water is 
 freezing and there aren't enough boats.

Not enough by half. Half the people 
 on this ship are going to die.

Not the better half.



Come on ,  Ruth ,  get in the boat. 
 First-class seats are right up here.

You know ,  it's a pity 
 I didn't keep that drawing.

It'll be worth 
 a lot more by morning.



You unimaginable bastard.



Molly: Come on ,  Rose ,  darling. 
 There's plenty of room for you.

Come on ,  Rose. 
 You're next ,  darling.

Come into the boat ,  Rose.



Come. 
 - Rose ,  get into the boat.

Rose.

Good-bye ,  Mother.



Rose! Rose ,  come back here!

Where are you going? 
 To him?

To be a whore to a gutter rat?

I'd rather be his whore 
 than your wife.



No. No!



I said no! 
 - ( Hawking)

Ruth: 
 Rose! Please stop!

Crewman: 
 And lower away!



No ,  wait! 
 - Lower away!

Rose! 
 - Lower together!



Help!

Can anybody hear me?

( Banging Pipe) 
 Hello ,  help me!

( Distantly): 
 Help me!

Can anybody hear me?

Somebody help me ,  please!

Rose: 
 Mr. Andrews?



Steward ,  check the starboard corridor. 
 - Yes ,  Mr. Andrews.

Madam ,  please put on a life belt. 
 Get to the boat deck immediately.

Lucy ,  for God's sake ,  
 put on your life belt.

Set a good example. 
 - Yes ,  sir.

Anyone in here? 
 - Mr. Andrews? Mr. Andrews ,  thank God.

Where would the master-at-arms 
 take someone under arrest? 

What? You have to get 
 to a boat right away.

No! I'm doing this with or without your 
 help ,  sir ,  but without will take longer.



Take the elevator to the bottom. Go 
 to the left down the crewman's passage.

Then go right and left again at the 
 stairs. You'll come to a long corridor.



This could be bad. 
 - (Water Gurgling)



Oh ,  shit. Oh ,  shit!



( Struggling)

Excuse me ,  thank you. 
 - Crewman: The lifts are closed.

Woman: I do not care... 
 - The lifts are--

I'm sorry ,  miss ,  
 but the lifts are closed.

I'm through being polite ,  goddamn it! 
 Now take me down!

E deck.



Come on. Oh ,  come on.



( Yells)



( Screams)

I'm going back up! 
 - No!

No ,  no!



Come back! 
 I'm going back up.



I'm going back up!

Jack?!

 - Rose!

Jack?!

Rose ,  I'm in here! 
 I'm in here.

-Jack?! 
 - I'm in here.



-Jack?! 
 - Rose!



Jack! Jack! I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.



That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. 
 - I know ,  I know ,  I know ,  I know.

Listen ,  Rose , you're going to have 
 to find a spare key ,  all right?

Look in that cabinet 
 right there.

It's a little 
 silver one ,  Rose.

Silver.

These are all brass ones! 
 - Check right here ,  Rose.



Rose...

how did you find out 
 I didn't do it?

I didn't.

I just realized I already knew.



Keep looking. 
 - Oh.



No key. There's no key!

All right ,  Rose ,  listen. You're going 
 to have to go find some help.

It'll be all right.



I'll be right back.



I'll just wait here.



Hello ,  is there anyone here?



Hello? Is there anybody 
 down here?



We need help! Hello!

Damn it.



Can anybody hear me? 
 Please ,  hello! Hello!



Oh ,  thank God. 
 Wait ,  please ,  I need your help.

There's a man back here and-- 
 Wait!



Hello?



( Loud Rumbling)

( Rose Breathing Hard)



Hello? 
 - Ah ,  miss , you shouldn't be here now.

Please ,  I need your help. 
 - This way ,  quickly.

There is a man down here 
 and he is trapped. Please.

There's no need to panic. 
 - No ,  I'm not panicking.

You're going the wrong way!

Let go of me ,  listen!



To hell with you. 
 - Oh!

( Ship Creaking)



( Softly): 
 Oh ,  my God...



( Explosion) 
 - ( Crackling)



( Gasping)



( Loud Rumbling)



-Jack! 
 - Rose!

Will this work? 
 - I guess we'll find out.

Come on.



Wait ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait. Try a couple 
 of practice swings over there.

All right.



Good ,  now try to hit 
 the same mark again ,  Rose.

You can do it.



Okay ,  that's enough practice.

Come on ,  Rose ,  
 you can do it. Listen.

Just hit it really hard 
 and really fast.



Wait ,  open your hands up 
 a little more.

Like that? 
 - Right.

Listen ,  Rose ,  I trust you.



Go!

-( Clang) 
 -( Gasps)

( Screaming And Laughing)

You did it! 
 Come on ,  let's go.

Oh ,  shit ,  this is cold. 
 Oh ,  shit!

Shit ,  shit.



This is the way out. 
 - We have to find another way. Come on.

Tiller: Pull. 
 - (Orchestra Playing)

Pull! 
 Put your backs into it ,  pull!

( Distant Shouting)

Pull!

Now ,  there's something 
 you don't see every day.

Pull!

Crewman: 
 What's this luggage doing here?

Get rid of it ,  we need the room. 
 - (Crewman Giving Orders)

( Crying)

Keep calm.

No!



-Lovejoy. 
 -She's not on the starboard side either.

We're running out of time 
 and this strutting martinet

isn't letting 
 any men on at all.

There's one on the other side 
 letting men on.

Well ,  then ,  that's our play. We'll need 
 some insurance first. Come on.

( Pounding) 
 - This way.

All the way down here. 
 - (Jack Yelling)

Steward: 
 Here! What Do you think you're doing?

You'll have to pay for that , you know. 
 That's White Star Line property.

Both: 
 Shut up!

Will you hold the boat a moment? 
 I just have to run back to my room--

Sit down! She's the last. 
 All right to lower.

Mr. Lightoller ,  why are the boats 
 being launched half full?

Not now ,  Mr. Andrews. 
 - There ,  look ,  20 or so

in a boat built for 65 ,  
 and I saw one boat with only 1 2-- 1 2!

Well ,  we weren't sure of the weight ,  
 Mr. Andrews. These boats may buckle.

Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast 
 with the weight of70 men!

Now ,  fill these boats ,  
 Mr. Lightoller ,  for God's sake ,  man!



Please ,  I need more women 
 and children ,  please.



Crewman: Get back in there. 
 This is not an exit.



Get back in there. 
 This is not an exit.



You can't keep us locked in here like 
 animals. The ship's bloody sinking!

Bring forward the women! 
 Unlock the gates.



Women only! No men!

( Shouting)



Get back!



Lock the gates!

Get them back 
 from those gates!

Don't touch the gates!



For God's sake ,  man ,  there are 
 women and children down here!

Let us up so we 
 can have a chance!

Get back!



-Jack! 
 - Tommy!

Can we get out? 
 - It's hopeless that way!

Whatever we do ,  
 we've got to do it fast.

-Jack! 
 - Fabrizio!

The boats are all gone. 
 - The whole place is flooding.

There is niente this way. 
 - All right.

Let's go this way ,  
 all right? Come on.



I make my own luck. 
 - So do l.



Come on! 
 - No ,  come on. Let's go this way.



(Crying) 
 - (Speaking Arabic)



This way. 
 - Steward: Just go back

to the main stairwell 
 and everything will be sorted out there.

Man: 
 Hell ,  it will.

It will all get sorted out back there. 
 Go back to the main stairwell.

Open the gate. 
 - Go back down the main stair.

Open the gate right now! 
 - Go back down the main stair...

Like I told you.

Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! 
 - Stop that.

Man: 
 Open the damn gate! Open it!



Fabri ,  Tommy ,  
 give me a hand here!

Rose: 
 Move aside. Move aside. Come on ,  pull!

Pull! Pull!



Move aside! 
 - Steward: Put that down.

Move aside! 
 - One! Two!

Stop that! 
 - Three!

( Screaming)

Again! 
 ( Screaming)

Jack: 
 Let's go!

-Jack: Let's go ,  Rose. 
 - You can't go up there.



You can't do this!



Lightoller: 
 Keep order here. Back ,  back ,  back.



( Screaming)



Hold on to her!

Pull her in! 
 Get back I say

or I'll shoot you all like dogs.



Keep order here! 

Keep order ,  I say.

Mr. Lowe ,  man this boat.



Lowe: 
 Right ,  is everybody all right?

Nobody panic.



Crewman: Stay back! 
 - We're too late.

There are more boats 
 down the front.

Stay with this one-- Murdoch. 
 He seems to be quite practical.

( Women Screaming)



Lowe: 
 Sit down!

Stay back , you lot. 
 Stay back!

Stay back ,  the lot of you! 
 Stay back!

( Gunshots) 
 - It's starting to fall apart.

We don't have much time.



Mr. Murdoch? 
 - Mr. Hockley.



You two ,  with me ,  now.



I'm a businessman ,  as you know and I 
 have a business proposition for you.



Crewman: 
 Easy now. All together.

Lower away ,  lower away.

Jack: 
 Come on ,  Rose.



The boats are gone!



Colonel ,  are there 
 any boats on that side?

No ,  miss ,  but there are a couple 
 of boats all the way forward.

This way ,  I'll lead you.



( Playing Final Chord)

What's the use? 
 Nobody's listening to us anyway.

Well ,  they don't listen to us 
 at dinner either.



Come on ,  let's play. Keep us warm. 
 "Orpheus."

( Playing Fast Music From 
 "Orpheus In The Underworld")

Music to drown by. 
 Now I know I'm in first class.



Where is everyone? 
 - They're all still aft ,  sir.



We have an understanding then ,  
 Mr. Murdoch?



( Everyone Shouting)



( Gunshots)

Women and children only! 
 Get back!

Step back ,  sir. Come through ,  madam. 
 This way. Step back ,  sir.



You'd better check 
 the other side. Go!



Crewman: Any more women and children? 
 Any children?

I found her on the other side 
 waiting for a boat... with him.



Any more women and children? 
 - They're all aboard ,  Mr. Murdoch.

Anyone else ,  then?

Anyone else? Hurry along.



Stand by the falls.

( Softly): 
 Oh ,  goddamn it all to hell.



Shit. 
 - Fire!

Sir! Sir , you can't 
 go through here.

Sir , you can't go through.



Yes , yes ,  splendid.



Right.

Murdoch: 
 Prepare to lower!



Ready on the left.



Take them down.



Keep it steady.



Both sides together ,  steady.

Keep it steady.

Give her to me. 
 - Girl: Daddy.

Man: It'll be fine ,  darling. 
 Don't you worry.

It's good-bye for a little while. 
 Only for a little while.

There'll be another boat 
 for the daddies.

This boat's for the mummies 
 and the children.

You hold Mummy's hand 
 and be a good little girl.

I'm not going without you. 
 - No , you have to go... now!

No , Jack. 
 - Get in the boat ,  Rose!

No , Jack. 
 - Yes ,  get on the boat.

Yes ,  get on the boat ,  Rose.



My God ,  look at you. 
 You look a fright.

Here.



Put this on. Come.



Go on ,  I'll get the next one. 
 - No ,  not without you.

Jack: I'll be all right. 
 Listen ,  I'll be fine.

I'm a survivor ,  all right? 
 Don't worry about me.

-Jack: Now go on ,  get on. 
 - I have an arrangement with an officer

on the other side 
 of the ship.

Jack and I can get off safely ,  
 both of us.

See? Got my own boat to catch.

Cal: 
 Now ,  hurry. They're almost full.



Step aboard ,  miss. 
 - Cal: Come on ,  hurry.

Step aboard ,  please. 
 - Man: Be Daddy's good girl.

Step lively. 
 - Crewman: Keep back ,  keep back ,  I say.



Clear the row ,  please.

Lower away!

( Passengers Gasp)

Crewman: 
 Slowly. Keep going. Keep going.

And lower away evenly ,  lads.

Easy. Lower away.

You're a good liar. 
 - Almost as good as you.

Crewman: 
 Easy now... and lower away.



There's no ,  uh-- 
 There's no arrangement ,  is there?



No ,  there is.

Not that you'll 
 benefit much from it.

one way or another.

 Easy. Even ,  lads.

Keep going ,  keep going.

Stop her! 
 -Jack: Rose ,  what are you doing?

Cal: Stop her! 
 - No!



Rose.



You're so stupid. 
 Why'd you do that?

You're so stupid ,  Rose.

Why did you do that? Why?

You jump ,  I jump ,  right?

Right.



Oh ,  God ,  I couldn't go.

I couldn't go , Jack.



It's all right. 
 We'll think of something else.

Oh ,  Rose.



Won't you even 
 make a try for it?



I'm sorry that I didn't build you 
 a stronger ship , young Rose.

It's going fast. 
 We have to move.

Wait.



Good luck to you ,  Rose.



And toyou.



Mr. Guggenheim. 
 These are for you ,  Mr. Guggenheim.

No ,  thank you.

 And He shall dwell with them

and they shall be His people

and God Himself 
 shall be with them...



Jack ,  this is where we first met.



And God shall wipe away 
 all the tears from their eyes

and there shall be 
 no more death.

Neither shall there 
 be sorrow or crying.

Neither shall there be 
 any more pain

 has passed away.

 You're scaring me.

 Grab an oar ,  let's go!

Man: Are you out of your mind? We're 
 in the middle of the North Atlantic!

Now ,  Do you people want to live 
 or Do you want to die?



I don't understand a one of you.



What's the matter with you? 
 It's your men out there!

( Crying) 
 - There's plenty of room for more.

And there'll be one less on this boat if 
 you don't shut that hole in yourface!

 Come back!

 Here ,  take this one.

 and tie these two boats together.



Now make sure that's tied up

Right ,  listen to me ,  men ,  
 we have to go back.

 from this boat

into that boat right now

to the White Star Line 
 about all this.

Don't you do that.

Don't you say your good-byes. 
 Not yet.

Do you understand me?

I'm so cold.

Listen ,  Rose...

you're going 
 to get out of here.



You're going to go on

and you're going 
 to make lots of babies

and you're going 
 to watch them grow.

You're going to die an old... 
 an old lady warm in her bed.



Not here. Not this night.

Not like this. 
 Do you understand me?



I can't feel my body.



Winning that ticket ,  Rose ,  was 
 the best thing that ever happened to me.

and I'm thankful for that ,  Rose.

I'm thankful.

You must-- You must--



You must do me this honor--



You must promise me 
 that you'll survive

that you won't give up

no matter what happens



no matter how hopeless.



Promise me now ,  Rose



and never let go 
 of that promise.

I promise.



Never let go.



I will never let go , Jack.

I'll never let go.

 Right ahead ,  sir.

 Oars!

Do you see any moving?

No ,  sir. 
 None moving ,  sir.

Check them.

Bring that oar up here.



Check them ,  make sure.

These are dead ,  sir.

Now give way. Ahead easy.



Careful with your oars. 
 Don't hit them.



( Shouts): 
 Is there anyone alive out there?

( Faint And Echoing):

Is there anyone alive out there?

1  , 500 people went into the sea

when Titanic sank from under us.



There were 20 boats 
 floating nearby

and only one came back.

One.



Six were saved 
 from the water

myself included.

Six... out of 1  , 500.



Afterward ,  the 700 people 
 in the boats



had nothing to do but wait--



wait to die ,  wait to live...



wait for an absolution 
 that would never come.



Oh ,  sir ,  I don't think you'll find 
 any of your people down here.

It's all steerage.



Woman: 
 His hair is reddish brown.

Reddish brown. 
 Reddish brown and a white beard.

Woman: 
 Isn't there another passenger list?

There's no other list. 
 - Perhaps he's on another ship.

We're doing all we can ,  ma'am. 
 - There's got to be another list!



That's the last time 
 I ever saw him.

He married ,  of course ,  
 and inherited his millions

but the crash of'29 
 hit his interests hard



and he put a pistol 
 in his mouth that year

or so I read.

( Rain Drizzling)



Can I take 
 your name please ,  love?



Dawson.



Rose Dawson.



Thank you.



We never found anything on Jack. 
 There's no record of him at all.



No ,  there wouldn't be ,  
 would there?

And I've never 
 spoken of him until now.

Not to anyone ,  
 not even your grandfather.

A woman's heart 
 is a deep ocean of secrets.

But now you know there was 
 a man named Jack Dawson

and that he saved me

in every way 
 that a person can be saved.



I don't even have 
 a picture of him.



He exists now only in my memory.



Man: Keldysh ,  Keldysh ,  Mir2 
 on our way to the surface.



Brock: You know I was saving this 
 for when I found the diamond.



( Man Giving Instructions 
 Over P.A. )



I'm sorry.



Three years

I've thought of nothing 
 except Titanic

but I never got it.



I never let it in.



** Every night in my dreams **

** I see you **



** I feel you **

**That is how I know **

**You go on **



** Far across the distance **

**And spaces between us **

**You have come to show **

**You go on **



** Near**

** Far**

**Wherever you are **

** I believe that **

**The heart does go on **

** Once more **

**You open the door**

**And you're here in my heart **

**And my heart will **

** Go on and on **

** Love can touch just one time **

**And last for a lifetime **

**And never let go **

**Till we're gone **



** Love was when I loved you **

** One true time I hold to **

** In my life we'll always **

** Go on **

** Near**

** Far**

**Wherever you are **

** I believe that **

**The heart does go on **

** Once more **

**You open the door**



**And you're here in my heart **

**And my heart will **

** Go on and on **



**You're here **

**There's nothing I fear**

**And I know that **

** My heart will go on **

**We'll stay**

** Forever this way**



**You are safe in my heart **

**And my heart will **

** Go on and on **
