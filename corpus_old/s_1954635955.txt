911. What is your emergency?

911. What is your
current location?

Are you okay?
Oh!

Turn around.

Turn around!

God! Sorry. I thought
you were dead.

No. I'm not dead!

I was sleeping.

Oh, God. Oh.

You want me to call a paramedic?
No!

Just... God!
Just back off!

Stop helping.

Butt out!

Creep!

Asshole!

Hi.

Hi. Hey. Sorry.

Um... where is this?

Excuse me?

I-I just... My car broke down
and my cell phone's dead,

so I just need to call...

What town is this?

New Smyrna Beach.

What?

Hey. Hey. What can I get ya?

Um, do you have a cell
phone charger I could use?

Everything okay?

Yeah, yeah. I just need
to use a phone.

Well, I don't bring my charger
to work, but you can use mine.

Thanks.

Actually, you know,
could I get a glass of water?

Yeah.

Do you have anything
for a headache?

Sorry.

Hello?
Hey, Dad?

Gracie.
Hey, it's me.

Oh, my God, Gracie. Where are you?
Are you okay?

Yes, I am fine. Why does
everybody keep asking me that?

It's her
 Where is she?

Listen, Dad, um, you're
not gonna believe this,

but the car got towed,

and I just need a few hundred
dollars to get it back.

Gracie, where are you?
Tell her to stay put.

I'm in Fort Lauderdale.

No, Gracie, you're not.
You're not.

I know where you are.
You're in New Smyrna Beach.

We arrived yesterday. So please, stop
lying and tell me where you are.

It's a coffee shop.
Where?

What's the place called?
Where is it?

I don't kn...
Then ask somebody.

Now!

What's this place called?
Nichols' Surf CafÃ©.

Um, Nichols' Surf CafÃ©.

Where?
Nichols'.

Okay. Got it.
I...

Stay where you are. Stay where you are.
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

Okay.
I mean it, Gracie.

I'll get the car.
Okay!

Dad.

What?

Sit.

You didn't even tell us
you were leaving town.

When... When...
When did you leave New York?

Can you even remember anything?

Dad, I just... forgot where
I parked the car, you know?

You crashed the car, Gracie.
I do not want to talk to you!

Enough!

We had two police officers
show up at the house...

in the middle of the night...

to tell us that your car was
wrecked two miles from here...

and you were missing.

Can you even begin to imagine
what that feels like?

Why can't you just support me instead
of always kicking me when I'm down?

We have supported you.

Oh, not you.
I'm not talking to you.

I don't care if you don't
wanna talk to me.

Your father has spent thousands
of dollars on you, Gracie.

It's not your money!
Why do you care?

You flunked out of college, you
wrecked cars... - She's still talking.

Why is she talking? Why is she here?
That's plural, Gracie.

It has nothing to do with me or
your father why you are a drunk.

Not me and not your father.
This is your mess.

And your mother's death
is just an excuse for you.

Do not talk about her. You
want to talk about betrayal?

Do not talk about my mom.
You are using her and her death...

to stop people
from holding you accountable.

You are an alcoholic, Gracie.

You are just like your mother.
Do not talk about her!

Tell her to shut up!

Come on. Come on.
I know. I know.

All right.

This is it, okay?
I just, um...

I just need, like,
a couple days,

like a couple hundred
dollars, that's it.

I cannot go through this
with you again.

I can't do it. I can't...
No. Listen to what I'm saying.

I just need, like...
I'm sorry, Gracie.

No, no, no, Daddy.
Please listen to me.

Please stop talking. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

I'll get help. I will.

I will. I'll get help.

I will!
I'll get help.

Just please... please
don't do this to me.

No. No. Daddy, please
don't do this...

No. Not right now.
Please, Daddy.

Please, please, please.
I can't!

I love you, Gracie,
but no more money,

no more cars,
no more car loans,

no more unfinished college
courses, no more bailouts.

No more. No more.

God, Mom would be
so... ashamed of you.

You ever think about her?

Can you look at her?

No. No, no, no.
What?

No. No.

No, no, no, no, no, no.
No!

Where is it?
Where is it?

They left about an hour ago.

I'll live.

You mind if I sit down?
I don't own the place.

I'm Sonia.

What's your name?

Gracie.
All right. Pleased to meet you, Gracie.

I haven't had a drink
in 11 years,

but I used to drink.

A lot.

I used to run from town
to town and guy to guy,

and I was always swearing that the next
one wasn't gonna be like the last.

And every new town, every
new start, every new guy...

They always went real bad
real fast.

Real fast.

No matter how many
promises I made...

even to myself...

it always ended up the same.

That sound familiar?

The question is, are you ready
to try something different?

Thanks.

Yeah, 1972. "Sweet
Caroline." It's a classic.

Hi.
Hey.

What are you having?
Um...

Whatever he's having.

You look like
you're enjoying yours.

Supposed to be
on vacation, right?

Um, you know,
can I, uh, open a tab?

I'm probably gonna have a few.

Sure, if you'd like to
put a card behind the bar.

Yeah, of course.

Where is...

Oh... man.

Sucks.

You know what? I think I, um,
forgot my wallet in the car.

So... just the one,
I guess.

Don't worry.
It's on me.

Thanks.

Well, hello!

Cheers.
Cheers.

I'm Gracie.

I'm Chris. Mmm.
Nice to meet you.

Mmm.

So you on vacation too?

Moved here when I retired
three years ago.

Retired?

What... What are you,
like, 40?

Come on.
You're good.

"Forty."

So what is there to do
in this town?

Depends on what
you're in the mood for.

Well, cheers to that.

Cheers to that.

I'll have another.

I... No! No, let go!

She wants you to feel her...
Come on.

Get your drunk girlfriend
out of here!

I'm just saying, that's a fake...
Hey!

Oi!

Clean that up. - It's fake. It's
just nobody wants to acknowledge that!

That's it. Get out. - She's not causing
a problem. She needs another beer.

I'm serious!
Get out, now!

You get out!

Babe, come on. I'm gonna give
you a ride. - Don't touch me.

Aw, come on, babe.
Where's Chris?

You get out!
Bitch!

Asshole! Come on. Don't
worry about him.

What are the Popsicles called
with the red, white and the blue?

The rocket ones?

Leave him alone. You clean...
You clean that up!

Stay in there!
Come on!

People like telling me
what to do.

Hey! Yeah!
Clean that up!

So you said they're coming
home for the summer? Hey! Hey!

Yeah!

Come on, get on. Get on.

Oh, yeah!
Is that a dog?

Oh, my God. He's so cute.
Wait, no!

He jumped off.

Elaine, can you hold that for me?
Don't leave me!

I'll be right back.

He left me.

Oh.
Oh, look at that.

Feels like a comfy...

Oh, yeah.

So how we doin'?

Oh, no, don't...
Are you here for him?

No. 'Cause he's... he's
a really good dog.

He's a really good dog.
Where are you staying, miss?

Where are you staying at?
Hmm?

I'm staying with you.
You are?

You wanna come sit with me? 'Cause
it's really comf... It's really comfy.

Come sit with me.
I'm good.

Come sit with me and my dog.

I'll stand here.
Why?

Are you staying in town?

Yeah. We...

Didn't you...

With your friend?
Yes!

It's Chris's son...

Wait, I'll show you... Miss, miss,
could you stay down, please?

Hey! Get off! Get off of me!
Okay. Okay.

It's all right.

Just tryin' to
show you my friend.

Right. Miss, please, could you please...
Do not touch... me!

All right. Okay.
Okay! Okay!

No! That's how it's gonna be?

What are you doing?

Rape!

It's okay. She was kidding.
She didn't mean it.

This is Officer Parsons, requesting
10-16 at Flagler Tavern.

10-4.

You've reached James Turner.

Please leave your name
and number at the tone.

Dad?

I know you're mad at me, okay,
but I really need your help.

So can you please
pick up the phone?

Okay, Dad,
I'm in jail, and it's...

this stupid misunderstanding.

It's nothing. It's just
that they're telling me...

that I can't get to court
until Monday.

So I really need
your help, Daddy.

I really need you to get
me out of here because,

um, it's really scary
in here, Daddy.

I love you...

and, um,

I'm sorry.

And I'll be good. I will be
good if you just help me.

I just really need help. I just
really need you right now, Dad.

So can you please
just get me out of here?

Okay, I love you. Bye.

Shit.

Okay. Here's the deal.

The public prosecutor wanted to
send you to jail for six months.

What? Why?
But I...

Wait. I was just drunk!
What is this, Saudi Arabia?

No, no, no. Listen.
Stop, stop, stop. Listen.

I said he wanted you to go to jail
for six months. I got us a deal.

It's a plea bargain.

They're gonna drop the
assault charge on the cop...

if you plead guilty
to the public drunkenness.

Okay. Okay.
What do I have to do?

Well, you're gonna have to attend 90
meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.

In 90 days.

Is that it?

Pretty much. Okay? Except...
Except... Yeah.

If you re offend, if you
fail to attend the

meetings, you're gonna
find yourself back here.

Yeah, yeah. And I know this prosecutor,
and he'll go to this judge,

and he'll want to try you
on that assault charge.

That would not be good. Okay? I'm good.
I'm good. I can do that.

So that's great.
Let's just... Let's do that.

You're gonna have to carry out the
sentence here, but there will be...

Wait. Did you just say "here"?
There are going to be...

What do you mean, "here"?
There are going to be drug testings.

Stop doing that for a second.
Did you just say "here"?

Like, this town?
New Smyrna Beach?

No, no, no. Anywhere
in Volusia County.

No. No, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.

I... I cannot stay here.

So...

I don't live here.
I live in New York.

Why can't I just do it
in New York? That's...

I don't... have any money.
I don't have any place to stay.

I don't have a job.
What kind of idiot are you?

That's not how it works.

That's not how it works.

All right? The prosecutor
pulled your file.

You've got a DUI, you've got three
misdemeanors. They all involve alcohol.

Now we're talking about
an assault on a police officer.

They're not gonna let you leave
unless they're comfortable.

All right. You know what?

That is fine. I will go back to
them, and I will tell them no.

Of course, the constitution will
guarantee that you get a fair trial...

by a jury of your peers.

Of course, I don't think you're
doing so great for bail money,

so they're probably going to remand
you until they set a trial date.

Okay.
I'll do it, okay?

This is bullshit.

No, Miss Turner.
It's consequences.

And that was the end
of that relationship.

Last I heard, he married the bitch
somewhere up in New Jersey.

But I pray for her every day.

I say, "God, please let her
get shot in a drive-by."

Just kidding.

Not really.

"Where there is hatred,
let me sow love,

where there is injury,
pardon."

That's a great prayer
if you don't know it.

Saint Francis
of, uh, somewhere.

Anyway, that's all
the wisdom I've got.

Thanks.
Thanks, Jessie.

Before we move on, I notice
that we have a new face.

Hi. Is this
your first meeting?

Yeah. Can somebody
sign my form?

Um, sure. Sure.

Just see me
at the end of the meeting.

What was your name?
Gracie.

Gracie.
Well, welcome, Gracie.

Hi, Gracie.

Okay. Who's next?

Well, I'll keep
the ball rollin'.

Uh, my name's Pat.
I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Pat.
Hi, everybody.

Just to fill you in on
what's going on with me...

I had a really bad day
yesterday.

Um, you know, I've been out
of work for a long time.

I had two job interviews
yesterday.

And I was really excited
about it.

I really thought that I was gonna get
one of these jobs, and I didn't get it.

I really wanted to go drink for
the first time in a long time.

But I didn't do that.

That's one of the things I've learned in
here... that's just like what life is.

It's just one thing
after the other and...

Like I said, I'm really glad
to be here today.

Glad to see
all you guys here too.

Thanks, everybody.

Thanks, Pat.

Okay. Are there
any other announcements?

I do. I'm Rosemarie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Rosemarie.

The annual Sober Dance
is this Saturday night.

Whoo!
Yeah!

And for anyone who hasn't been
to one of our Sober Dances,

they're always a lot of fun,

and chances are you won't
wake up somewhere...

or with someone you don't know.

That's all.

Okay, I asked Bill here
to hand out our chips.

Bill?

Well, my name is Bill,
and I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Bill.

We give out chips here at our group
to recognize periods of sobriety.

The first one
is most important.

It's white.

If you're new,
this one's for you.

Any takers?

All right.
Now we've got three months.

Anybody here
celebrating three months?

All right, Reef!

Reef!
Reef!

My man!
Hey.

Mwah! Oh, yeah.

Phew.

Now we got six months.

Any takers for six months?

Now we're down to nine months.

Anyone here celebrating nine months?
You know what?

Um, actually,
I'll take a white chip.

Well done, Gracie!

Hey!

All right. Yay!

Here. Come on!

Good job!

Good, good, good.

Gee.
Good job!

Anybody... Anybody want
this nine-month chip?

Yes!
Yeah?

Oh, my God!
Thank you!

Ah.

There you go.
Oh.

Yeah, Jessie!

All right, finally,
anybody got a year,

or multiples of a year?

All right. Well, let's hear
it for the chips we hold!

Good job, guys.
Good job.

Hey.

There you go.
Thanks.

Why don't you, um, hang out?

Hi. Sorry.
I'm Pickles.

Gracie.
Hi. Sorry.

Hey.

Hey.

Look, I know you're not here 'cause you
wanna be, but I'm glad to see you.

Yeah.

Are you hungry?

What?

What do you want from me?
So I'm a loser. Next?

Do you need a job?

Yeah.

Do you have a place to stay?

All right.
Here's the deal.

I can offer you a couple of
shifts a week at the coffee shop,

and you can stay at my place
for a while if you want.

But you gotta stay sober, and
you gotta give me no trouble.

And...

that's it.

Why would you do that for me?

Because I probably know more
about you than you think.

Oh, man, when you
attacked that cop...

I was right across the street.

And that took me back to 1993,

when I was being cuffed
by a Wayne County sheriff,

who was trying to shove me
into the back of a cruiser.

Domestic abuse. I'd had a fight with my
boyfriend, and I stabbed him with a pencil.

Mmm.
Yeah, apparently.

Um... Yeah.

Anyway, that cop, he was
trying to shove me in there,

and I managed
to turn around somehow...

and kick him like a mule,
square in the nuts.

Wow, look. You do smile.

So what happened?

Well, I told everybody it's
'cause he grabbed my breasts.

But you wanna know the
real reason that I did it?

No idea.

I was drunk off my ass.

Couldn't remember a thing.

Grace.

Your family will
come around eventually.

You're just gonna have
to change a few things.

Like what?

Everything.

All right.

Here is your room.

And the shower is over there.

There are towels.

Come on in.
Don't be shy.

Hey, do you have anything else
besides what you're wearing?

Um, I might have
some stuff in my car,

but I don't know
where that is, so...

Right. Okay.

Uh, let's see what I can find.

Um...

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Gracie!

Hey! Uh...

Pickles?

I-I saw you last night
at the, uh... the meeting?

Oh. Right.
Yeah.

Hi.
Hi.

Hi. I'm Karleigh.

Hi. Hey, uh, can I
get you, like, a...

a "sodee"?

Um, no, no.
Sure?

Hey, do you... Why don't you...
Here. Come on.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Jump up.

I'm good. Thanks.

Oh-ho-ho, man.
Oh, God, he ate it, man.

Didn't I see him picking up a
three-month chip last night?

Yes.
Is that him?

That's huge.

So, um, how long
have you... been sober?

About, like, uh...
like 45 minutes.

I-I don't really
have a problem.

I just... I go to meetings
'cause they have, uh, doughnuts.

Mmm.

And I get to, like, look at all
the cute drunk girls. - Hey!

And, uh... No, no.
I'm just... I'm just kidding.

Uh... Like four years.

Yeah, clean and sober.

Do you want to, um,
like, hang out today?

I think we're gonna go see a
movie later, right? Yeah, sure.

I think he's coming too.

What's up, yo?
What up, man?

Totally got merked
on that last wave.

Yeah, you got, like,
totally shut down.

Yeah. Whoo.

What's up?

You surf?

You wanna try?

She's gonna come with us
to the movies later.

Sweet.

I won't have to worry about
her talking the whole time.

Please.

The ocean calls.

Later, Gracie.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what time it is?

Oh, my God.
I get off at 6:30.

Come pick me up?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, Dolphin Inn?
Okay.

Do you know where it is?
No. But I'll find it.

It's a small town.
Can't be that hard.

Hi.

Hi.

What? I made it.
Right?

It's always good
to be a little early.

So you're gonna have to teach me
how to use one of these.

All in good time. First you
gotta learn the mail room.

Now, you like a half caff
double latte, right?

Yes.
Okay, great.

Hey.

You and I are gonna cut out early.
Got a surprise for ya.

Don't worry.
You're gonna like it.

How long have you worked here?

Um, two months.

So... what's her story?

Oh, what's to tell?

Um, she was in a band
in Detroit.

Wannabe rock star and all that.

Uh, she drank a lot,

took pills, got pregnant.

Her life fell apart,
and her daughter OD'd at 19.

And I think that's probably
one of her T-shirts.

What's up?

Nothing.

Okay.

How did you like your massage?

It's nice. It's...
They're so great here.

The best ever, right?
Amen.

Oh, I wouldn't know.
That was my first one.

Where are you from, Gracie?

New York.
Wow!

Have you ever been
to a Broadway show?

I'm not actually from the city.

My dad works there,
but I don't go there very much.

I'd love to see a Broadway show.
What does he do?

I don't know.
He wears a suit.

Aw, that's okay, honey. More
importantly, what do you do?

Besides getting drunk
and crashing cars?

Oh! Sorry I'm late!

Oh! I completely forgot.

Menopause.

Would you like something to drink?
Oh, yes.

Vodka and orange.

Mmm, better not. I always
end up in the wrong bed.

So, how's the newcomer?

Have they told you
not to date boys...

Jess!
Or make any other big decisions yet?

Just ignore her, Gracie.
Okay, okay.

I think this girl needs
to have some real fun.

What do ya say, Gracie?

I met the love of my life
when I was 21 years old.

Met him in a bar, of course.

Oh, he was a great surfer.

I didn't really even
like him much...

in the beginning.

But as time went by,

he slowly took over my life.

First time he hit me,

we were at a drive-through
on our way to a party.

I ordered the wrong drink,

and he banged my head
off the car window.

Oh, my God.

I threatened to leave him
if he ever touched me again,

as I did every time
it happened after that.

But I went back.

I went back again
and again and again.

Why?
Because I'm an addict.

I always go back.

When I finally got sober,
he just found another victim.

That sucks.

I'm sorry. That's
a really shitty story.

That's okay.
I got married to Tom.

He's a nice guy.

It hurts being like us, Gracie.

I never felt comfortable
in my own skin.

So I drank to be sexy.

I did cocaine to be thin.

I tortured myself
with plastic surgery...

to... to look young
and be beautiful.

And for what?

I manufactured a woman...

that I don't even like.

You know, I... I don't know the
first thing about being sober.

But I hope
you find your way out.

Gotta go.

Do you want a ride?
No, it's okay. I'll walk.

Good-bye, Gracie.

Bye.

Hey!

I thought you weren't gonna show.
Yeah.

Hi, Gracie!
Hi.

What's up, girl?

Yo. What time's
the movie?

7:30.
7:30?

You can just hang out here.

7:30?
I... I... I can't go.

Why not?

Um, I have to go to a meeting.

You... have to go?

Yeah, yeah. She got a court order.
She hit a cop.

Yeah.
I did not hit a cop.

Aw!
It was an accident.

Oh, yes.
An accident, for sure.

Oh, my God. Is there anything
secret in this town?

Uh... no.
No.

Definitely not.
All right.

Well...
Hey, I'll come with you.

Can always use
another meeting, you know.

Well, I thought we were... Can't
we go to, like, the 9:00?

Dude. Catch up with you later.
Yeah?

Totally.
Yeah?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cool.

Bye.
Bye.

I gotta go.
See ya.

Okay, everybody.
Let's start our meeting, huh?

Guys wanna start a meeting?
Yeah.

Yeah? Yeah? Good.

All right.
Hello, everyone.

Welcome to "We Are Not a Glum Lot"
meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.

My name is David,
and I am an alcoholic.

Hi, David.

Uh, can somebody read the blue card?
Who'd I give that to?

Oh. That was me.
Ah. Marijane. Excellent.

Hi, I'm Marijane,
and I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Marijane.

"This is an open meeting
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

We are glad you are all here,
especially newcomers.

In keeping with our singleness of
purpose and our third tradition,

which states that the only
requirement for AA membership...

is a desire to stop drinking,

we ask that all
who participate..."

It reminded me
of when we were married.

He always reacted to
everything by screaming

and yelling, and
it was just awful.

And I reacted by drinking.

You holding out on me?
A bottle of wine, rum, whatever it was.

Thank you, guys, for all
your help and your support.

You've been a wonder for me. Thank
you so much for everything.

Okay, uh, who's next?

I'm Rosemarie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Rosemarie.

Um, I didn't have
a drink today,

so I'm
a rip-roaring success.

But, uh, I can't stay sober
unless I get sober.

Ninety-nine percent of my problems
go away when I don't drink.

But abstinence is not sobriety.

No one ever forced
a drink down my throat.

I drank because, um,

I liked the effect
produced by alcohol.

Alcohol suppressed my growth.

It, um,

prevented me from having
adult relationships...

because it was easier
to get drunk than to grow.

I escaped my problems,
but at the same time...

I ignored my responsibilities.

I had to learn to grow up.

That's all.

Okay, who's next?

Um...
Gracie.

Yeah. Told you that
last night.

Sorry.
Remember?

Yeah, I'm Gracie, and I'm, um,

here, I guess...

Um...

I mean, I was
court-ordered to be here,

so I guess I wouldn't choose
to be here if I had a choice.

But I don't. Um...

No, you know why
I'm actually here?

I'm actually here because my
dad turned his back on me.

He also abandoned my mom 15 years
ago and let her die alone,

so I guess I shouldn't
really be holding out

for any kind of big
daddy reconciliation.

I mean, people
are selfish, right?

You really wanna tell me
to "grow up"?

What, you don't like the way I am?
I don't care!

This is a free country.
Right?

Why won't anybody just leave me
alone to do what I want to do?

I mean, this is my life!
If I want to get

wasted, why is that
anybody else's business?

Oh, no.
My name is Jessie.

And... I need
to tell you the truth.

And you're not gonna
stop me, Marijane.

Jessie, why don't you come in and sit
down with us? - I don't wanna sit down!

And I don't wanna
talk to you, Rosemarie!

And I don't wanna talk
to you, Saint Sonia!

I don't want you...

to tell me to accept it.

I don't want to be sober.

It hurts too much.
The pain is too great.

We love you, Jessie.
I don't want you to love me.

But we do.
We love you, baby.

You're all a bunch of phonies.

You are. You're all a bunch of...
a bunch of liars.

None of you are sober.

I hate this place.
I hate these rooms!

Jessie? Jessie, come on.

No, Jessie! Jessie, no!
I've gotta pee!

I've got to pee!
I know.

We're not gonna do that here. We're
gonna go home. I'm gonna get you home.

Marijane, you're no fun.
I know, I know.

I'm a big ol' fuddy-duddy,
but that's the way it is.

Here we go.
Get her in.

Let's go party!

Let's go party!

We're gonna go party
at your house, baby.

Got a seat?
Hi.

Oh, Marijane! Oh, my God.
What happened?

Rosemarie's gonna drive you.
She got wasted.

But that's nobody else's
business, is it?

Party! Party!
Let's go party!

You wanna get out of here?

Come on.

God.

Crazy.

So you're all
just lying, right?

What?

Does anybody
actually like being sober?

I mean, I'm on day two,
and it sucks already.

I mean, it gets better.
Jessie didn't think so.

Well, some people
just... never get it.

I don't get it.

I don't.

I mean,
why did you stop partying?

Well, I mean, I...
Don't bullshit me.

I want the truth.
Why'd you stop partying?

Well...

I lost a music scholarship
after my second DUI.

First they just kinda
counted it as a bad day.

Second one meant
that I had a bad habit.

So now, instead of cuttin'
waves between class in Malibu,

I'm cuttin' grass
between waves...

here.

You know, I hung out with her today
and she was actually really cool.

She's a chronic relapser.

She'll be back.

If she ever
gets over the shame.

Oh.
Yeah.

I can't even...

That was a little...

What brought you
to New Smyrna Beach?

Mommy?

Oh, I see.

She's got secrets.

Get off of me!
I hate you so much!

I hate you!
Do not do this!

Mommy
Leave me alone!

I came here once
when I was a kid.

Before my mom died.

How'd she die?

How do you think?

You know what?

Wait right here.

Where are you going?

Don't move!

I got a surprise for you
back in the truck!

Seriously?

Does it look like I'm joking?
No.

Surf'll be good tomorrow.

Always is after a full moon.

Did you know...

that all the tides of the
earth come from the moon?

Right now, all of this...

the entire ocean...

is being lifted by the moon.

That's pretty amazing, huh?

So do you actually play?

Do I play?

Have a feeling it might be...
be in a different tune...

You don't have to
do this right now.

I do have another 88 days here,
so if you need to practice...

Don't throw me under the bus just yet.
Come on.

Hi.

I did your laundry.

Thanks.

Are you okay?

Are you upset about Jessie?

Do you have any idea what the chances
are for you actually getting sober?

Especially with
your mother's history?

That wasn't hard to pick up on
at the coffee house.

It was pretty clear
that whole thing was messed up.

Yeah. - But right now you
need to be paying attention...

to the people in the rooms instead of
distracting yourself with some guy.

Come on. We were just... - I don't know
if your mother ever tried to get help.

But there are worse things
than dying from this disease,

and you need to be respectful
of the people...

that are actually living with
the damage that it caused.

Chill out, okay?
I don't feel like a lecture.

Do you feel?

What would you feel like if I told you
there was a woman in there tonight...

who killed her husband
and her child...

when she crashed her car
when she was drunk,

and she's spent the last 20
years trying to live with that?

I don't even know what you're
talking about. - Yes, you do.

No, I don't! - You do, because
you and Reef laughed in her face.

Rosemarie?

I shouldn't have told you.
That's not my story to tell.

But I cannot keep my mouth shut if
you're not gonna take this seriously.

And Reef,
he should know better.

Alcoholism is a disease,
and it is fueled by obsession.

I'm not obsessive.
Oh.

Did you see Jessie in there?

Yeah. I saw.
Wh...

I'm not like her.

You are if you get into a relationship
before you really get sober.

If he treats you good, you feel good.
If he treats you bad, you feel bad.

He becomes the center
of your world.

It's the same old story. I've
seen it time and time again.

Wow. I didn't know you were gonna
tell me who I could hang out with...

when you said
I could stay here.

It's good to know.

I'm going to bed.

If that's okay with you.

Whoa!
Oh, sh...

I'm sorry.

What are you doing?

Get your ass down here,
Gracie. Surf's up.

What time is it?

Surfin' time!

Okay, I need five minutes.

You got two minutes.
Five!

Okay, you got three minutes.

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Can you see that?
Oh, my God.

Whoa.

It's really bad.

Oh, my God.
Nice.

My legs are all wobbly.

Well, for being the most
graceful wipeout queen,

got this guy for you.

Oh, my God.
You like it?

Yeah!

It's so beautiful.

You wanna come
to a party tonight?

Maybe.

Where is it?

Just sent you the address.

It's at my place.

My parents are out of town.

It's just a few people.

Who's coming?
Just you and me.

Oh, it's that kind of party.

Well, it's on the beach.

Outdoor shower.
Skinny-dippin'.

Mm-hmm.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Maybe I'll come after.

"After"?
After what?

The Sober Dance.
Sober Dance.

I promised Sonia I would go.

Of course you're going
to the Sober Dance.

Are you not going?
Sober Dance?

Not good for Reef.

Oh, my God. You're gonna
make me go alone?

Mm-hmm.
God!

I thought you liked me. You
wanna hang out right now?

We'll go to St. Augustine.
Right now.

I can't.
Yes, you...

I'm working.
"Working"?

You work at a coffee shop.

It's not like
you're saving babies.

Come on.

I have to go.

No, you don't.
I do.

Come on.
I do.

But I will see you later,
right?

At the Sober Dance?

Maybe.

I'll see you later.
Yeah?

Run along.

Don't be late.

Hi.

You're early.
Mm-hmm.

So, where do you want me to start?
Kitchen? Bathrooms? Sewers?

Oh! Uh...

Mmm.

Really good.

This is the best.

All right.

Okay.

You look really cute.
Mmm.

I've always loved that dress.
Yeah?

Is it yours?

No.

It's not the prom.
Okay.

Hi... Oh.
Hey. "Oh"?

Oh. Sorry. I-I just
thought you were, uh...

Yeah.
No, I know.

Where is he? Is he... Is he here?
Uh, I don't know.

But, um, I know he's coming.
Uh-huh.

Can I buy you a drink?

Like a...
drink drink?

Like a drink...

drink.

Yeah. Come on.

Did he stand you up?

No.

Does that change
when you get sober?

Uh, no, it does not.

But at least
you make better choices.

Okay, sorry. I'll stop. But I would like to
help you avoid the same mistakes I made.

I'm trying. Okay?

Okay. Fine.
I will... back off.

I'm... I'm so sorry. You're gonna
have so much fun without me.

I promise.
What?

When are you gonna be home?

You okay?
Yeah! I'm fine, yeah.

She just got, like,
called into work.

I don't know, somebody
didn't, um, show up, so...

Oh.

You don't think it was my dancing or
anything that, like, drove her off?

No!
No?

No, your dancing is...
No, it's not!

Oh, no! Uh...

I don't know. It might've
been my whole ensemble.

No! No, I think you look
like P... like Pocahontas.

That's, like,
the worst compliment ever.

I'm so sorry.
It is. Uh...

Hmm.

Oh. Hold on.

What's up?

Seriously?

What's up?

Nothing. It's...

Hey, you wanna dance?

Like now? Yeah!
Yeah?

Yeah.

Completely sober,
I'm much better.

You're good!

Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm...

You know what? I'm gonna take off.
Oh, yeah, sure.

Do you want, um... Do you want a ride?
No, it's not far. I'll walk.

Oh, yeah. Sleep well. Thanks!

Good night, Pocahontas.

Grace.
Yeah?

Are you leaving?

Yeah, I just... I got tired,
so I'm just gonna go home.

Really.

He didn't show, so you're gonna humiliate
yourself by trying to find him?

Please. Okay?
I can't do this now.

Honey, do not make this
about abandonment.

You've only known him
for, what, two days?

Oh, my God!
I'm going to bed!

Do you know what it feels like
to be lied to?

I don't know. Do you
know what it feels like

to be dressed in your
dead daughter's clothes?

I'm sorry.
That...

I didn't m...

I wouldn't say mean things if
people would just get off my case.

Right. Do you know what you're
really addicted to, Grace?

Your story.

But you're right.
It is none of my business.

I'm sorry.

Hey! I gotta go.

Where you goin'? I
have to go to work!

Work?
Come on.

Come here. Come on. - I can't. I
don't have time to do it again.

You don't have to go to work.
Yes, I have to go to work.

You work in a restaurant.
Come on.

It's not like
you're saving babies.

I'm gonna kill you! I will kill you!
Pickles, stop it!

I will kill you!
Pickles, stop! Stop!

What are you trying to do?
What the hell, bro?

Don't! Don't. Don't.
Don't! Don't! Stop!

What the hell, man? - How could
you do this to me? Oh, my God, man.

Gracie!

Gracie, wait!
Gracie! Wait!

Wait!

Hey!

I used to run around,
guy to guy.

Every new start. Every new town.
It always ended up the same.

That sound familiar?
Gracie!

Gracie!
Where you going...

Asshole!
I'm sorry!

Sorry.
I hate you!

I'm sorry!
I hate you!

Gracie, calm down!
Calm down! No!

Gracie!

Gracie.

Grace?

What's wrong?
No. Stop.

I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna
hear it. I don't wanna hear it.

What happened?

Like you care what happened!

What do you mean? Of course I care!
Where are you going?

Somewhere!
Anywhere!

If you run, you're just gonna take the
problem with you. You know that, don't you?

So you're not gonna have to deal with it,
are you? That's not the point, Grace.

You don't even want me here.
What are you talking about?

You know what? You just wanna run.
Stop!

You want the same action, you're
gonna get the same result.

Don't! Don't give me advice.
Okay?

I was fine before I met you.

Grace, calm down. I was!
I was fine!

You are not fine.
You need to calm down.

Think about this. You've got a home here.
You have a job.

Stop! What is wrong...
Why do you...

Stop!
Get out of my way!

Is this about some guy
who doesn't even want you?

No! Leave me alone!

Just leave me alone!

Gracie!

Get away from me!
I hate you!

Get away!

Get off me!
Get off me!

You promised! Don't do this!
Get away from me!

I hate you!
No, you don't. Look what you're doing.

You're scaring her.

Mommy?

No. No. No.
I won't leave you alone.

No, I won't leave you alone!
I hate you!

Get away from me!

I hate you.

Come on, Mommy.

Why did you leave me, Mom?

Why did you do it?

Wasn't I worth being well for?

Why didn't you take care of me?

Because she was ill, Gracie.

And if I could change the
past for you, I would do it.

I would.

But we can't change the past.

If I could, I would've
done it 11 years ago...

when my daughter died
of that overdose.

And every night since then
I go to sleep,

and I imagine
how I could've stopped it.

But I was too ill.

I hate her.

Oh, God, no.

Don't say that, Gracie.

How do I not hate her?

She missed everything
I needed her for.

She missed everything
that mattered.

I needed her.

I had no one...

to talk to when I got lost.

Yeah.

I do.

I hate her.

I don't trust anybody.

And it's because of her.

Grace.

Where are you gonna go?
Grace?

Sonia?

Sonia!

Gracie!
Where's Sonia?

Why?
What's going on?

Sonia!
It's Jessie!

Come on!

Let's go!

Wait!

She crashed her car
up by 1-95.

They took her into surgery a
couple of hours ago. Was it bad?

Where's Tom? He went to get a
cup of coffee a while ago.

Oh, here he is.
Tom? Hey.

She's been drunk
since yesterday.

They said she was doing 90 miles
an hour when she lost control.

I'm sure the doctors
are gonna do every...

We did what we could.
Oh, my God!

I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

[ Dispatcher, Indistinct ]

Thank you.

It is my great pleasure...

to introduce
tonight's speaker, Gracie.

Whoo!

Hi. I'm Gracie.
I'm an alcoholic.

Hi, Gracie!
Hi.

I think I know all of you and have gotten
to know all of you over the years.

I don't know why all of you,
especially my family,

put up with the person I was
when I landed here.

All I know for sure is that a
community of strangers loved me...

until I could love myself.

This disease has claimed
so many lives,

including my mom and...

our Jessie.

I-I am just so grateful
to all of you...

for guiding me
into this new way of life.
