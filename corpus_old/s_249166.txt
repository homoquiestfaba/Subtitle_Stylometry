Bearing three-niner-five.
Approaching target, over.

Confirm vector for ground elevation.

We are go for housekeeping.

Raptor standing by
on your coordinates.

Roger, understood.

Al I rig ht, this is it.
Secure those rafts.

Let's go, go, go!

It was another day.
Another mission.

Marines were flushing the rebels off
the beach and up to the mountains...

... where my team
was going to catch them.

A classic tac-ops mission.

Flying fast and low.

Five hundred feet over a valley
we blasted the night before.

My team...

... was ready.

Cooper, take out that gunner!

Go, go, go!

We got two cover teams in position.

Possibility of bunkers.

Need ATPD on grid,
7. 1 degrees north.

Get down!

Move out!

Move, move, move!

What I can tell you is,
as of 0650 today...

...our joint forces engaged rebels...

...known to be harboring
foreign fighters...

...from the AKD.

Are you specifically targeting...

...Abubakar Al Hassan,
who fought in Afghanistan?

This is a serious game,
and we are pursuing AKD leaders.

And we'll catch them,
that's all there is to it.

While our forces will be
driving the rebels west...

...General Bondoc's army...

...will be pushing
the AKD brigade into the valley.

As Captain Escalona
is fond of saying...

...we know more about where the
rebels are than they do themselves.

I see how all this helps
with their rebel problem here...

...but how are we doing
in the war against the AKD?

Certain factions of the rebels...

-...are AKD.
-Right, but...

...the Mindanao rebels have fought
the government...

...for more than 30 years.

Now suddenly,
you've decided they're AKD?

-Why?
-We believe that their...

...withdrawal from
the peace negotiations...

...and the recent surge
in bombings and kidnappings...

...are directly related to AKD.

The Philippine government
is certain of this.

Absolutely.

Scout Two for Flight Control. Over.

Go ahead, Scout Two.

Control, we have visual
confirming fire teams...

...have cleared the beach. Over.

Copy Scout Two.
And the rebels? Over.

Still searching for the camp.
We'll report on contact. Over.

Roger that. Control out.

Flight Control to Eagle One. Over.

This is Eagle One.
Go ahead, Control.

Advance scouts report
no rebel contact in the inland valley.

Looks like a clean ride for you
up to the drop point. Over.

That's good to hear, Control.

Any word on Abubakar? Over.

Early reports have rebels moving over
the mountains. But no specific word...

... on Abubakar Al Hassan
or the other leaders.

Copy. We've Just cleared
the second waypoint. Over.

They're still on schedule
to set the trap at the Alpha drop.

Proceed to your
next waypoint. Over.

Roger that, Flight Control.
Eagle One out.

Captain, any news on the target?

Amphibious has Just landed.
Still no word on Al Hassan.

But lntel says
we have a clear flight path...

...so we're going to
insert you as quickly as we can.

They say that
it's good luck to be a--

T o have a woman to
bring them to battle.

-Yeah, right.
-Kindly tell Diaz that he gets...

...an F on his luck,
and to go do himself.

The AKD has been sending
money and weapons...

...to these rebels for years now.

New intelligence tells us that
top AKD leaders are in Mindanao...

...and they are planning
a maJor strike...

-...against the West.
-The West?

Does that include
our allies in the lraq war?

Is Australia the target?

Bruce, you know
I can't comment on that.

Gentlemen, ladies...

...thank you for your patience,
that's all for now.

No more questions.

At the top level, are we expecting
another World Trade Center?

Please excuse us.

Captain Escalona will answer
any further questions.

-How big, general, would you say?
-How big, what's the scale?

-Later.
-Gentlemen, this way, please.

You are clear to insert
the strike team at the Alpha drop.

Over.

Roger that, Flight Control,
Eagle One out.

Alex, they say that we're
cleared for the Alpha drop.

MaJor, lntel says that the rebels
are still holding tight...

...on the beach, but there's
still no word on our target.

Abubakar knows he can't
take us in a straight fight.

I'm hit.

We're taking heavy fire.

Eagle One to Flight Ops.
We are taking heavy AA ground fire.

Flight Control to Eagle One.
Garbled. Repeat. Over.

Eagle One hit. Section Delta Five.
Delta Five. Over.

We're losing it.

-We're going down.
-Hang on.

This is it. Hang on.

Hold tight.

Eagle One, respond. Over.

I lost their beacon. Check on 48.3.

Tac Com, get me
505th Rescue.

We need a recovery team,
we've got a bird down.

-Chopper down?
-Yes, sir.

Who was on it?

MaJor Aginaldo's strike team...

...and two Americans.

Eagle One down.

Eagle One down. Over.

Eagle One to Flight Control.

Alex.

Alex.

Oh, my God.

Lieutenant Pierce?

Can you move it?

Can you move it?

Oh, Just barely.

You should go.

The rebels who shot us
down can't be far.

I'm not gonna leave you here.

I'm gonna get the
medical kit and we're gonna...

...patch your leg up. And then
we're gonna move out.

The rifles must have
fallen out with the crash.

Maybe you should go.

You don't know
what the rebels do to women.

Can't be any worse than
what they did to your men.

Let's put a splint on that.

The rebels are coming.

Leave me.

Leave me. I'll do this.

Do you hear that?

We're not leaving anybody behind.

You good to go?

-Yeah.
-Okay, I'm gonna go pop some smoke.

Flight Control, this is Rescue One.

Entering sector Delta Five, over.

Copy that, Rescue One.

We've got signal smoke.
Confirmed signal smoke.

Secure for extraction. Over.

Copy that,
Rescue One. Commencing.

Rescue One, we've got
a blip on infrared.

Roger that.

-Chopper down, chopper down.
-Do you hear that?

Y eah.

There's only one plane left.
We better move.

Flight Control, we've lost
Rescue Two. Send backup.

We are returning fire.

We gotta go. Move. Move.

Parker.

You stay here. You count to five...

...and hit them with a grenade.

-All right, sir.
-Start counting.

Move out.

Get down. Get down.

Cooper. Sniper. You got him?

Hundred yards up.

He's ten o'clock high.

Jackson, up front. Stay low.

We got a sniper. Ten o'clock high.

I got him.

-Parker, you all right?
-Yes, sir.

Move out.

Roll over and show me your hands.

Parker. Parker.

Roll over and show me your hands.

Alpha squad, sound off!

Jackson, check.

I know it hurts.

Come on. A little bit further.

We Just gotta go up to the--

Set me down here.
Set me down here.

I'm slowing you down too much.

Marines never leave their own behind.
I'm staying with you.

I outrank you, captain.
This isn't advice.

It's an order.

I know what these rebels are like.

It's better for both of us
if you go on ahead.

They'll Just hold me for ransom.

You're an American.

You know, I'm gonna have
to change these dressings.

-I'll take care of it.
-No, I can do this.

You Just keep going
back the way we came in.

2nd Army's flushing
the rebels to the south.

Our amphibious assault
is pushing Abubakar's men...

...off the beach. This whole place is
about to be surrounded with bogeys.

-MaJor you can't--
-There's good cover here.

-You can't Just--
-I'll be fine. Captain, keep going north.

Just keep going north.

-Go.
-Yes, sir.

Here. You take care.

-Just bring back the cavalry.
-I will.

Any sign of Abubakar?

-That's a negative, sir.
-Okay, secure the site.

Roger that. Alpha out.

Found a claymore
and took care of it, sir.

Good. Forward observers spotted...

...al-Qaeda leadership moving
toward the mountains.

MaJor Golez and the reinforcement
company are going after them.

-And what about us, sir?
-Finish securing the camp.

We rest here tonight. We lead
MaJor Golez tomorrow morning.

Army. Give up or we kill him.

We want ransom.
Don't make us kill you.

Hands.

His leg is broken.
You have to pick him up.

Then you carry him.

MaJor, come on.

Three. One...

...two...

...three.

-You got it?
-Yeah.

We walked for hours.

To a little village
in the middle of nowhere.

The major needed help.

But this was not the place to get it.

Go inside.

Okay.

He needs a doctor.

You take care of him.

Let me see this.

I' m sorry.

Can't get a body count on this one,
and there's no sign of survivors.

Recon Six saw signal smoke.

Any draw fire?

They launched two Stingers.

At the recon plane.

General Lewis, sir, the Pentagon.

If they launch missiles...

...on a plane that is that far out...

...the AKD must have
bought them a lot of ammo.

General Lewis, here.

Congratulations, general.

Your special ops team was shot
down before they got near the target.

You lost two rescue choppers.

And apparently, the survivors
were taken hostage.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

What was that?

I said we have a bad line, sir.

This is a total command failure.

Embarrassing.

We believed our
intelligence to be good.

We based our strategy on it.

The enemy doesn't always do
what you want them to do.

They have a choice too.

Damn right. And what do you think
they're gonna do...

... to captured American soldiers?

How do you think the American public
is going to react to a video of....

-Who 's the captain?
-Jennings.

Okay. Jennings, begging for life.

You think that's going
to help recruitment?

We' ll get her out, sir.

Good. They're your stars.

Y es, sir.

How do we find Jennings?

Can't risk another rescue chopper.

Daniels and Montalvo.

If there are any survivors, they're
the ones who can get them back.

Patrol Three. Confirm orders to
circle back and return to base.

Copy that. We got nothing out here.

Back home, my daddy used to say...

...in order to find north, you look for
the side of the tree with the moss on it.

Out here in this Jungle,
you got moss everywhere.

-Yeah, there is.
-Yeah.

What are you
gonna teach your kids?

Oh, I don't have any kids.

Not now, but....

-Do you have a husband?
-Not that I've met.

-Smart, fine woman like you?
-Thank you.

I wouldn't want my wife
to be in a mess like this.

Well...

...maybe that's why
I haven't found him yet.

Yeah.

You know...

...it was really brave of you
to come back for me.

Thanks.

When the opportunity
presents itself...

...you have to escape.

I'm in no shape to go with you.

All right.

Don't you wanna
get some sleep, sir?

I Just wanna get these done.

Get them back to the families.

Lieutenant Montalvo's looking
for you. Says we got new orders.

When we heard the choppers...

...I knew I had a chance to escape.

But then I met Abubakar.

The man we were sent to catch.

All right.

Rebels shot down three of our
helicopters in less then one hour.

Flyboys can't get in there,
so they're calling in the grunts.

High altitude recon shows
nothing left of the team...

...so we're looking for
survivors from Eagle One.

That's the Ranger squad
under MaJor Diego Aginaldo.

And two Americans. Special ops
coordinator Lieutenant Mark Pierce...

...and Captain Amy Jennings,
pilot out of 3rd Tactical.

The main force will be
pursuing rebel leadership.

But they're going
the same place we are.

So we're gonna take the river.

Get up ahead of them,
deep in rebel territory.

General Bondoc's 2nd Army
is pushing a group of rebels...

...up from the south.
That means we've got...

...two prongs...

...squeezing a whole bunch of
rebels right where we're going.

Our Job is to get there first...

...and get our Marines back.

Brief your fire teams.
We move out in ten mikes.

Lieutenant.

What were they doing out here?

Who's that?

The Rangers and that chick pilot.

That pilot is a Marine aviator
and a superior officer.

No offense, sir...

...but I won't even let
my old lady drive my car.

She was a counterinsurgency
specialist.

HQ sent them out here to capture
one of the rebel leaders.

Abubakar Al Hassan...

...al-Qaeda's number two
in Southeast Asia.

Let's get the men ashore.

Take cover.

Lieutenant Daniels.
Lieutenant Reyes, Philippine army.

We were two days
ahead of schedule...

-...until they started hitting our flank.
-Sounds like a trap.

The rest of the air support
and divisions...

...are tied up about 5 klicks back.
What about you guys?

Looking for a Huey that went down
in Delta Five.

That's Just the other side
of this mess.

Damn, they've got the range.

How about the back side?

It's mined.

Jackson.

Get up here.

Got a minefield. Can you clear it?

I'm not packing that kind of gear.

How about if we
drop a coconut tree?

-That'll work.
-Good, get on it.

Roger that, sir.

They won't be expecting us.

Jackson, go.

Move out.

Go, go.

Two-oh-three!

Two-oh-three!

Jackson, I'm in.

Clear.

Clear.

All clear.

Jackson, you all right?

Here comes the cavalry.

I didn't know why I was still alive.

But as they took me deeper
into rebel territory...

...it was clear
they wanted something.

She says they left the village.

Did they have any prisoners?

She says they have
a woman prisoner.

They have Captain Jennings.

-Abaya, radio.
-Yes, sir.

HQ, HQ, this is Alpha Squad.
Come in.

Alpha Squad, HQ. We copy.
Go ahead, identify.

This is Lieutenant Daniels, sir.

We're in the village
with Lieutenant Reyes.

You got a 20 on Captain Jennings?
Has she been injured?

That's negative.
We don't know if she's been inJured.

This search has to go
down fast. You copy that?

Yes, sir.

I want you to keep me informed.

Roger that, sir. Alpha Squad out.

Lieutenant.

Any trace of MaJor Aginaldo?

No.

Gear up. Get the men out.

You think you are so powerful.

That is your destruction.

The death of America.

It is Allah's Justice.

Soon, your lnfidel cities will die.

And so will you.

-Abaya.
-Sir.

Radio Lieutenant Reyes
back at the village.

Tell him we found
MaJor Aginaldo's body.

Yes, sir.

Cooper, move out.

Don't wanna think about what
they're doing to Captain Jennings.

Neither do l.

Abubakar wanted me to talk.

Not for what I knew,
but for what I could say.

Government...

...and American soldier...

...must leave Mindanao.

Say it.

Captain Amy Jennings...

...United States Marine Corps.

Service number 571 84337.

God bless Ameri--

Government and
American soldiers...

...must leave Mindanao.

Say it now.

Captain Amy Jennings...

...United States Marine Corps--

Say it.

No.

Roger that. Alpha out.

Intel doesn't have a damn clue.

Jackson, what do you have
up there?

Looks like it gets pretty thick.

Coop, what about you?

I got a road leading up.

What do you think?

I think straight up.

We'll try to get a view
from a high point.

If we can't see anything...

...at least we've got a defensible
bivouac for the night.

All right. All right, we're going up.
Move out.

What do you mean
he's not in HQ?

-He's not here, sir.
-Can you find him?

-No.
-No?

Well, then, where is the general?

That's classified information, sir.

Roger that. Alpha out.

Worthless.

They rolled up HQ.

Is this operation over?

Last we heard, Abubakar was
taking her in that direction.

We're not out here
to let her slip away.

That bastard. He's got her.

Until we get other orders...

...we've got a soldier to save.

Let's pack it up. Move it out.

Looks like one of ours.

It's a dray.

Cooper, go.

Go, go.

Moving out.

Damn, looks like they've got
a lot of firepower out here.

They must have moved up
the assault.

Jackson, talk to a supply sergeant.

-See if we can get more ammo.
-Yes, sir.

-Coop, you and the men take 1 0.
-Roger that, sir.

-How are you doing, sir?
-Hey.

General Lewis, sir?
Roger that. This way, sir.

-Gentlemen.
-Sir.

I'm sorry I can't do more
for you right now.

We cannot hold off the assault.

This war is getting bigger than we...

...planned for.

Mission first.

Marine always.

You're doing a good Job, lieutenant.

Keep it up.

Yes, sir.

I know the Army's coming.

Where is to come?

When will they attack?

Where is to come?

Where will they attack?

T ell me.

I said tell me.

I don't know.

I don't know.

-Hey, Jackson.
-What's up?

You think they get football
on that thing?

Right now I'd settle for some cartoons
and some real breakfast, Coop.

Roger that.

All right, guys, rally up.

-Sir, where are those troops going?
-Same place we are, Coop.

All right.

This is it. The place they're holding
Captain Jennings.

Right here.

It's heavily fortified and
crawling with bogeys.

General Al Fatwa's training camp.

There's only one road into it...

...and General Panlilo's
taking the main force right up it.

Air support is committed to a rebel
reinforcement column...

...moving down the back side
of these mountains.

Until the main force gets there,
it's Just us and a whole lot of them.

This is General Rashid Al Fatwa.

He runs the camp.

And lntel's latest photo of
our old buddy Abubakar.

They've got Captain Jennings.

We're gonna get her out.

Intel says Abubakar's
made an alliance...

...with the remnants
of another rebel group.

That leaves us the hills to the south.

Impassable for trucks and
heavy armor. So we're hoofing it.

General says the main force
is moving out at zero-nine...

...so we're gonna have to haul ass to
get to that camp. Any questions?

Make sure you guys chow down,
have some water...

...move out in five mikes.

Let's go get our Marine back.

Who's leading the column?

Twenty-three, APC.
They move in five minutes.

If they move in five minutes,
we'll give...

...Daniels and Montalvo a 1 5-minute
head start, at the most.

What if we delay the artillery?

Save you a few good men.

Orders are orders, general, but...

...the Pentagon can kiss my ass.

-There's a watchtower.
-Good eyes, Cooper.

All right.

Let's try to get through that.
Cut to the right.

-Right here, single file.
-Roger that, sir.

The main force should be
moving already.

Means the base is on the other side.

Let's see if we can
get over there undetected.

Where is to come?

When will be attack?

No.

Don't.

Please?

I don't know.

-When will be attack?
-I don't know.

-T ell me.
-I don't know.

T ell me.

The main force is late.

Maybe the general's
bought us some time.

We've gotta hurry
before the artillery drops on us.

Unless we wanna take some
shrapnel up the backside.

Guys, pick up and move out.

Cooper.

Let's move out.

Move. Go.

Move out.

Go.

Go, go. Go, go, go.

Cooper, with me.
We've gotta get some eyes on.

-Coordinates, three-five-zero.
-On my command.

Let's move out.

Go, go.

Go, go, go.

We gotta get inside that building.
Coop, check it out.

There's a guy with a video camera.

That's it.

Probably gonna tape it
for propaganda.

What's going on?

Couple of guys arguing.

Let me take a look.

The guy in black's Abubakar.

You want me to take him out?

Not yet.

If he's here, he might lead us
to Captain Jennings.

I think the guy with the video camera
is entering the building.

-You ready for this?
-Roger that.

Let's move out, Coop.

Where is the camp?

When will they attack?

Where is the camp?

When will they attack?

Lanyard one, fire.

Jackson, move.

-Two down.
-Center's clear!

Jackson, door.

Fire.

We're a go for second wave.
Over.

Man down right. Left clear.

-Right clear.
-I'm at the door.

Captain Jennings.
Lieutenant Daniels, USMC.

-Can you walk?
-Yes.

Round one.

-Good to go?
-I'm good.

I need a new gun.

I'm unarmed.

I got a flank behind me.

Come on, let's go.

Aim for the hole.

Who wants me?

Stay with me.

Jackson, you're the last man in.

Cooper, Jackson, let's go.

-Now. Move.
-Let's go, Jackson. Let's go.

-We're clear. We're clear.
-Move out.

-Two down. Two down.
-Keep moving. Keep moving.

We have no word from Daniels.
Assault full ahead. Over.

-You okay?
-I'm good.

All right. Perimeter's
about a hundred meters south.

-Let's move.
-Wait, lieutenant.

They've got anthrax,
a biochemical lab...

...Abubakar tried
to get me to make a tape.

He's gonna kill
a whole lot of people.

The lab is the last door on the left,
southeast side.

Look, we've gotta burn that anthrax
before they use it.

I've got an incendiary.

That'll do. Let's move.

Coop, with me.

Move. Move.

Let's move it. Let's go.

Go. Go. Go.

Go. Let's go. Come on.

Move, move, move.

Montalvo, Jennings.

These incendiaries burn
at 2400 degrees.

I'm gonna make sure
that shit's dead.

Are you sure we won't spread it?

Gotta trust my demo guy.

-It's set.
-All right. Grab your gear. Let's move.

Get down.

Fall back. Fall back.

All my men, fall back.

Go, go.

Move, move, move. Pull back.

Move, move, move.

Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

Go. Go.

Pull back.

Pull back. Go.

Get down.

Sound off.

-Cooper's down, Jackson.
-Check.

Montalvo here.

-Jennings, you all right?
-Jennings, check.

Friendlies to the left.

-Good to see you.
-You okay?

Fine, thank you. There was a
biological lab inside. It's pretty nasty.

-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

Thank you.

Always, sir.

-Johnson.
-Good work, sir.

-Good work.
-Good work.

-Yeah.
-Good work, good work.

-You saved my punk ass.
-You saved my life again.

Thank you, lieutenant.

Marines don't leave
their own behind.

Lieutenant Daniels got me out alive.

I got to thank him in person.

But not the men who didn't make it.

God, it's still hard to lose them.

You didn't lose anyone, Daniels.

We trained them well.

And we fought hard.

You didn't lose anyone.

The rebels took them.

Al-Qaeda took them.
