dddd [ Woman Vocalizing ]

dddd [ Vocalizing Continues ]

It's snowing in summer?
It's not snow.
It's more like ashes.

Hey, hey, hey!

[ Man Groaning, Mumbling ]

Get your own!

[ Screaming ]

[ Sinister Laughter ]

Hercules, it's a clay wall.

It doesn't have to
be perfect.

It's better to do it right
the first time...

than to have to do it
all over again
when it falls down.

But if it takes forever
to do it the first time,
what's the point?

Oh, I know.
You're doing it for your mom.
[ Chuckles ]

Hercules?
Hmm?

A messenger
just came for you
from Queen Leda.

I'm afraid it's bad news.
Did something happen
to Tyndareus?

No, no, no,
the king is fine.

But their daughter ran away
and got married,

and Leda's afraid
he's gonna start a war
because of it.

Oh, Tyndareus.
Another word for "hothead."

He's a good man.
He'll come to his senses.

He's been making offerings
to Ares and raising an army.

Ares. Terrific.
Just what we need.
[ Chuckles ]

I promise my next visit
will be longer.

That'll give me something
to look forward to.
Yeah.

[ Woman ]
Welcome home, Callisto.

Hope.

Why?

It's over.

Leave me alone.

Your work's
not finished, Callisto.

[ Chuckles ]

I've done all I can.

Not yet.

Your biggest challenge
is ahead.

And what would that be?

To rid the world
of its greatest hero--

Hercules.

[ Man Narrating ]
This is the story
of a time long ago,

a time of myth and legend,

when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

Only one man dared
to challenge their power--

Hercules.

Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

But wherever
there was evil,

wherever an innocent
would suffer,

there would be... Hercules.

[ Screeching ]
[ Roaring ]

Hail!

You were right
to come to me, Tyndareus.
A thing of beauty, isn't it?

Forged by Hephaestus,
worthy of a god.

It feels... alive.

[ Snaps Fingers ]

The fit. The finish.

The balance.

Feel the power.

See how it draws,
smooth and sure.

Be one with the arrow.

[ Whoops ]
Call him
"Tyndareus the Terrible!"

Now, all this
could be yours.

Your army will
slaughter its enemies.

Thousands, no. Tens of thousands
will die by your hand!

But I only want
my daughter back.

That poor,
sweet, innocent girl.

When I think of
her being deceived--

tricked into
that marriage, I--

You are doing
the right thing.

Any good father
would do as much.

You're absolutely right,
of course.

I appreciate what
you're doing for me, but--

Eh, no guts,
no glory, King.

Hey,Iam
trying to help you here.

I could give these weapons
to your enemies.

It really makes no difference
to mewhoslaughterswhom.

But you'd never see
Daddy's girl again.

You're right.

I'll kill him
with my own bare hands!

That's the ticket!

And the great thing is,
it's gonna cost you nothing.

[ Hercules ]
Only your soul.

Who invited him
to the party?

I wanna talk
to my brother, Tyndareus.

You go with Iolaus.

But Ares has agreed
to help me get my daughter.

King.

Don't you have any scruples?

Huh?
Any what?

You took advantage
of that man's desperation.

He had potential.

No matter.
I'll find someone else.

Not with these toys,
you won't.

[ Gasps ]

No!

Oh, the horror!

There. That's better.

It took Hephaestus months
to forge those weapons!

Well, Hephaestus
needs a new hobby,
like, maybe, knitting.

Eh? Eh.
[ Yelling ]

[ Yelling Continues ]

[ Screams, Gasping ]

You don't suppose Zeus
has lifted that pesky little...

"No gods kill another god"
rule, do you?
[ Chuckles ]

And the day started so well.
[ Grunts ]

Yeah. Well, bye, guys.
It's... been fun.

Eh--
Get up and act like
  a god, you worm.

[ Groaning ]

Okay.

You've changed, Hope.

I hardly recognized you.

Things change.
 Things stay the same.

I am who I always was.

Yeah.

And you want to kill Hercules.
It's been tried.

I can't believe you
have disturbed me for this.

The two of us
will do it together.

To refuse would be a mistake.

Oh, yeah? And, uh,
what exactly are you
gonna do if I don't, huh?

You gonna kill me? 'Cause I'm
a goddess now, sweet cheeks,
and goddesses don't die.

Your life is empty.

You need a purpose.

My life--
 My life will never end,

and it was over years ago
in Cirra.

There is nothing
you can do for me, Hope,

so you go away!

I can redeem your life--

rid you of your demons--
in a way you
never thought possible.

I appreciate your intentions,
but it's my daughter's
future at stake.

And not your
fatherly pride?

Certainly not.

Do you know the guy
she's marrying?
Yes, I know him.

So, what's wrong with him?
He's not good enough
for her, that's what.

Why? Because she's a princess?
Well, it's not that.

He comes from
a royal family too.
It's just that, uh--

It's just that...
she's your daughter.

She deserves better.
Have you talked to her
  about this?

Yes, I did.
I forbade her to see him,
let alone marry him.

Then she did
the obvious thing
and ran away and did it.

Tyndareus, I've known you
for a long time.

I know how much
you and your daughter
love each other.

Don't let this
  come between you.
I couldn't live if it did.

Well, then,
throw them a wedding feast.

Your daughter's in love.
You should be celebrating.

You're right.

Won't you both join us?

Hey, is the world supported
on the back of four
giant elephants?

Good.
Well, that's settled then.
I'll expect you.

He's a hothead,
but a nice guy.

Hmm. I thought
the world was round.

[ Scoffs ]
Really?
[ Laughs ]

I needed that war
to reinforce my position
on Olympus.

Those old fools
can't see what's coming,
but I can.

I know.

And you!
You're a worthless
excuse for a god.

He makes a fool of you
time and time again!

Hey, hey, hey,
I'm not the only one
who's afraid of crossing Zeus.

I still don't see Herc's head
on your belt,
Mr. Big, Bad God Of--

[ Screams ]

[ Callisto ]
Hit him again.
He deserves it.

Callisto.

Lookin' better than ever.

Immortal and a newborn goddess.

I'm flattered, Ares.

I really wasn't quite sure
what kind of reception
I would get as myself,

considering
the last time we met,
I was in Xena's body.

Ooh, I remember.

Callisto?
She's a twisted sister.

Next to her,
the Furies are, uh, mellow.

[ Laughing ]
Shut up, Strife.

[ Screaming ]

Whoa. Nice technique.

Yeah. Well, I love fire.

It's always been a part of me
since Xena's army
burned my home.

And that fire
turned my family to ashes.

And everybody died that day.

I love it when
you talk like that.

[ Clicks Tongue ]
Such delicious carnage.

Xena would have laid waste
to the entire mortal world
if Hercules hadn't interfered.

What has he got
against fun, huh?

Don't trust her, Unc.

You know, she may be a god,
but she's not one of us.

Shut up, Strife.
[ Groaning ]

I admire your technique too.

It's like a hammer
to an anvil.

You know, some people
are just begging
to get pounded.

I didn't think you noticed.
[ Groaning ]

I was talking
about Hercules.

Sooner or later,
he's gonna go too far,

and I might not be able
to restrain myself.

Oh, well,
that is a problem,
isn't it?

What would Zeus do
if that were ever to happen?

Huh?

What's an eternal life...
without the occasional risk?

You know what
your problem is? Huh?

You're always trying
to kill Hercules.

What if you just...
got rid of him in a way
that Zeus never knew about?

Then we'd really
have some fun, huh?

I'll show you carnage
like you never dreamed of--

a landscape littered
with body parts.

Unc, can't you see?
She's playing you like a lyre.
She's jerking your strings!

[ Together ]
Shut up, Strife!

[ Yelling ]

He's right about you,
isn't he?

But you wanna know more,
don't you?
I'm all ears.

Well, maybe notallears.

Okay, I like it.

But there's no need to rush.

Damn!

Ah, this is the place.

I'm ready if you are.

Oh, yeah.
I'm ready.

Was it good for you?
Not yet.

I'm back.

So, you're the Sovereign.

Gotta tell you,
love the beard.

Ares, the God of Love,
in basic black.

I approve.

Hey! You're not
in Neverland now, pal.
You're in my yard.

And Priestess Callisto.

You must be
my "welcome home" present.

[ Chuckles ]
Please, I really don't
wanna hear about it.

Just fork over the pendant,
sunshine.

This? Huh?
I don't think so.

Come to Papa.

[ Shouting ]

[ Chuckles ]

Wait a minute.

This isn't my world.

Disappointed!

As a fashion statement,
it, uh, comes in
a little short,

but since it's
filled with the blood
of the golden hind--

I think I'll keep this.

Hind's blood
is nasty stuff.

[ Laughs ]
It's the only thing
that will kill a god!

And the god who has it
is top gun!

Now, where were we?

Oh, yes.

Are you ready to consummate
our relationship
and move ahead with the plan?

Ah-ah-ah-ah.
One thing at a time.

First, we consummate.

Ares, I don't think
you trust me.

No.
All right.
What do I have to do
to convince you?

I don't trust her, Unc.
Dump her now.

It's what she deserves.
You pathetic little weasel!

[ Snorting ]
No, no, no, no.

[ Shouting, Screaming ]

Sometimes he can be
such an embarrassment.

Okay. Okay.

You made your point.

But, uh,
what do we do now?

How do we get Hercules
where we want him, hmm?

That is the beauty
of unleashing the Sovereign,
you nitwit.

My brother is such
a predictable do-gooder.

Soon he'll have his hands full
with his own bad self.

[ Sighs ]

Yes, and while he's busy
with the Sovereign,

that leaves us with our own
fun and games, doesn't it?

Hercules, we're going to this
wedding feast, aren't we?
Hmm?

It should be good.
Food, wine, dancing girls.
Dancing girls.

I wouldn't wanna
let you down.

Besides, I wanna see
how he handles having
a son-in-law under his roof.

Yeah.
And dancing girls.
Whoa! Big guy. Sorry.

My fault.
It's okay.

How'd you get here so fast?
Shaved.

New clothes.
How'd you do that?

I think it's
the drink talking.
Uh-huh.

Whatever works.
Just don't get him mad.

I've seen what he can do,
and I don't want
to see it again.

What do you think I did?

Arcadia. This morning.
You tore the place up.

Of course, it needed it.
Not a problem.

Are you sure it was him?
Sure I'm sure.

Of course, he had the beard,
that black leather outfit.
But it was your friend here.

[ Together ]
The Sovereign.

Let's get to Arcadia.
Yeah.

Thanks.
Thanks.

Whatever you say.

Hiya, Hercules.

Beautiful day,
isn't it?

What did you call me?

[ Shouting ]

You people should fear me!

-[ Man ] Look out!
Hide from me!

[ Both Shouting ]

Tremble at the sight of me!

[ Shouting ]

All I get...

are happy faces!

I hate happy!

Nice to see
  he's mellowed out.
[ Grunts ]

[ Iolaus ]
I'd hate to see him
when he gets really mad.

Hercules, he's the same
strength as you.
This could take forever.

Maybe not.

So, how's
your throwing arm?
Okay.

[ Laughs ]

[ Screaming ]
That's enough!

Nobody talks
to me like that!

Behave yourself,
  and stop acting like a child.
You.

[ Screaming ]

You trapped me
in that place.

But I'm out now,
and I'm not going back.

Oh, you're going back,
one way or another.

Really?

[ Laughs ]
Okay.

Oh!
[ Crowd Gasping, Clamoring ]

Oh, yeah.
  This is gonna be good.
Now, Iolaus!

[ Chuckles ]
You. I've been thinking
about you too.

Every night,
I've been dreaming
of snapping your...

[ Yawning ]
puny little neck.

Yeah? Well, I think
you're all talk.

What... did you do?

That's narcolepsis dust.

I recommend just a pinch
for a good night's sleep.

[ Laughs ]

Nighty-night.

You know, Herc,
something tells me he didn't
get out of there on his own.

I have a good idea
who it was too.
Yeah.

But first,
we gotta put him back--
this time for good.

[ Yawning ]
Wait a minute.

Where's the hind's blood?

It's not on him.
Whoever freed him
has it now.

[ Sighs ]
Great. Wake up, Iolaus.
Come on.

Well, here we are, but--

It's here, all right.
We just can't see it.

Now, how are we
gonna open it up?

-We'd be glad to help.
Callisto.

And Ares.

Hercules, there it is--
the hind's blood.
I knew it would be.

Well, how so, brother?
Well, who else would feel
  a need for it? Only you.

It's... mine!

Give it back,
or I'll tear it off your
rotting corpse!

I like your style.

Too bad you won't be
stickin' around long enough
for us to get acquainted.

All right,
cut the chitchat.
Let's just do it.

Do what?
It.

No, I'm not going back!

No!

[ Shouting ]
Hercules!

[ Screaming ]

Hercules, look out!

Oh, no, you don't!

[ Screaming ]

[ Shouting ]

No! Hercules!

Well, I think this calls
for a celebration.

Oh, just great!

Welcome to my nightmare!

It's not so bad.

Tell me the cup is half full,
and so help me--

There's gotta be a way
out of here.
Where's this road go to?

That road?
It's an endless circle.

See, it leads
right back to here.

I should know.
I've-- I've tried it
enough times!

This is unbelievable!

I finally escape,
and where do I end up?
Right back where I started--

trapped in this place
between worlds,

thanks to you.

Let go.

What, are you crazy?
If I die, you'll die too!

I don't care
about dying anymore!

I kill you. You kill me.
It doesn't matter.

Either way, it ends now.

[ Shouting ]

Bye-bye.

Hercules,
I don't know what to do.

To victory.
To a world without Hercules.

There's no
stopping us now.

"Us"?
You obsequious toad.
 You weren't even there.

Far be it for me
to steal your thunder.

You're the man with the plan.
 You're the mistress of mean.

I'm just proud
to be on the team.
[ Crying ]

[ Clears Throat ]
Does this brazen brownnosing
actually work with you?

What can I say?
A little... stroking
never hurt anyone.

No, no, no. Ah--

You can look,
but don't touch.

I want it.
I figured you did.

Come and get it,
if you think you can.

Oh, I know I can.
I was just hoping
you'd put up a fight.

[ Crash ]
[ Callisto Yelling ]

Ares!
[ Crash ]

[ Ares Yells ]

[ Yelling ]

Let's get mad!

[ Screaming ]

[ Whooping ]

Not exactly my idea of foreplay,
but it'll do.

[ Shouts ]

Oh, you're good, girlie.
But when it comes to physical
punishment, I invented the art.

[ Shouts ] Teach her a lesson!
I got your lesson, punk!

[ Screaming ]

Oh, that was low.

Well, I guess that was too,
but oh, well.

[ Laughs ]

Get up, Callisto.
Your work's not done.

[ Groaning ]

[ Yelling ]

Oh!
[ Yells ]

You're finished, Ares.

You're washed up
and wrung out.

Everything'll
be different now.

The last thing
anybody wants...

is a has-been god
like you!

Let me tell you
a little secret.

Just the idea,
the mere idea of you
touching me makes my skin crawl.

Come to Mama!

Strife, what are
you waiting for?

Do something!

Stop her.
Get that pendant back
before it's too late.

Now!
Um--

Now, no hard feelings,
okay?

I mean, you--
you got the chops,
and that's a fact.

If there's one thing
that us gods of aggression
appreciate,

it's a good show
of strong, brute force.

You know, no mercy.
[ Chuckles ]

So, uh, let me be the first
to welcome you to the club.

But I wouldn't wanna
be in a club that'd
have me for a member.

[ Shouts ]
[ Groaning ]

[ Rumbling ]

[ Chuckling ]

[ Roaring ]

What in Tartarus--

Something terrible
has happened.

Oh, what have you done?

He's dead.
Dead?

He can't be dead!
He's a god!

Well, at least we know
the stuff really works, huh?

Callisto.

He wasn't so bad.

He tried hard. He--

He was just
no good at his job.

You didn't
have to do this!

You know, Callisto
didn't do this by herself.

The one great evil
is here--

it's part of that creature
that was with her,

and we sensed him.

Everyone on Olympus has.
This--

This force of darkness
spells the end of all of us,

gods and man alike.

Then we've gotta stop her!
Stop her?

Didn't you
see what happened?
She can't be stopped!

If we got Hercules back,
maybe she can.
What can he do that I can't?

Think about it.

Whatever Callisto
and this evil are up to,

they had to get rid
of Hercules first.

It's him they're afraid of,
not you.

You know what?

I'm gonna go to Zeus.
We're gonna get the gods--
No, that's stupid.

He's gonna blame me
for getting Strife killed
right here!

Forget Zeus.
It's Callisto
we have to worry about.

She's killed one god.
Maybe you're next!
Shut up! I cannot think!

Ares, she played you for a sap,
and then she kicked your butt!

Enough!
[ Groaning ]

But maybe you're right.

Let's get the witch.

It's time.
The first part's finished.

Hercules is gone,
and you move on.

I'll do this for you,
and then it's my turn.

Your pain will be gone.

It'll be like
it was never there.

The promise stands.

You'll live
with a free heart.
But first, this.

Do it.

The ability
to cross time is yours.

All gods can do it.
You'll master the gift
eventually,

but for now,
you'll be shown the way.

Well, if all gods can do it--
They won't interfere...

as long as you
have the hind's blood.

Callisto!
You're too late.

It's too late
for all of you.
Where did she go?

She's gone back in time--
It can't be.

to stop Hercules
from ever being born.

Alcmene.

She's gone to kill
Hercules' mother.

You're a god.
You can go back in time.

Why don't you just
go back and get her?

I can't go chasing
after Callisto.
I got responsibilities here.

Strife is gone.
Someone's gotta
look after things.

Admit it, Ares.
You're scared.

[ Shouts ]

Okay. Send me back.
I'll go.

All right.
It's your funeral.

You can follow Callisto
wherever she goes,
but only where she goes.

And you can
come back to the present,
but that's it.

Make the most of it.
[ Coughs ]

[ Woman ]
Did you hear?
[ Woman #2 ] What?

The magistrate's wife
is having a little fling
with a stable boy.

Oh!
Why, she's old enough
to be his mother!

That's terrible!

Uh, excuse me.

This looks like... Corinth.

Well, it is Corinth.
Good. Good.

Uh, look, um,
I wonder if you
could help me.

I'm looking for someone.
She's, uh, tall, blonde,
bad-tempered.

A woman. Uh--

I don't know if she's
been here already or if
she's going to appear later.

Haven't seen her.
Have you been drinking?

No! No, no, no, no.
Not yet.

Uh, what about Hercules?
You know him?

Never heard of him.

Okay, uh, Alcmene.
How about her?

Oh, we know her all too well,
the harlot.

"Harlot."

Okay. Are we talking
about the same Alcmene?
Her husband's Amphitryon.

Her husband's dead.
He went off to war.

But Alcmene couldn't
be bothered to wait.

She's with child.

What do you think?

This is getting us nowhere!

I told you it wouldn't!

Now, listen to me.
If we work together,
we can find a way out of here!

For you, you mean.
Even if I did help you,
and we found a way out of here,

you would still try
to leave me in here.

Fine. Then I'll
do it on my own.

Sure! Go ahead,
for all the good it'll do you.

[ Scoffs ]
You're an idiot, you know that?

You know nothing about me.
Oh, yes, I do.

[ Laughs ]
Oh, yeah. See,
I've watched you in here.

You should make people
worship you,

tremble in fear.

But what do you do?

Oh, you help them out.

You solve
their puny problems.

You're pathetic.

Maybe you're the one
who's pathetic.

You ever think about that?

Are you so happy
with your own life?

Forget it!
Wait!

You said you watched me
in here. How?

I was thinking about you
putting me in this place,

and a window popped up
in that pool,

and there you were.

I tried to reach through it
to... strangle you.

Callisto and Ares didn't
put us in here on their own.

They had help
of some evil force.

I saw him.

Now Iolaus is alone
back there with what--
[ Water Sloshing ]

whatever it is.

Iolaus?

Get used to it.
It's torture.

We can see the outside world,
but we can't get back to it.

There has to be a way.

There's always a way.

There must be.

[ Chuckles ]
The baby kicked again.

He's so strong.

Our baby, Amphitryon,
no matter what anyone says.

I know it was you in
my bed that night,

even though they say
it's not possible.

They say you were killed
before the night
you came to me.

If that's true,
I have to believe,

because our love was so strong,
that you came to me
in spirit.

I know it was you.

I'll always love you.

Alcmene!

Um, uh,
you don't know me.

Uh, I'm a friend.

Iolaus.

Tell me, have you seen
any strangers around here?
A woman?

No. Just you.

What about Iphicles,
your son?
Is he inside?

No, no,
he's away with friends.

Who are you?
What do you want?

We haven't
got time for this.
He's with my mother.

I'll tell you in a moment.
We gotta get out of here.

Come on.
It's dangerous.

What are you doing?
Come on. I told you.
I'm a friend!

I'm not going
anywhere with you.

But wait!
  You don't understand!
[ Gasps ]

Callisto.
Hello. Can I help you?

Yes.

N-- No!
