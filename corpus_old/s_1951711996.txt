It was a lot of traffic

Liam Liu

Profile

So, you know Kung Fu?

Err...

What kind of art are you?

Err...

I, I don't have a ...

Oh, you know what I love?
I love suspenders

You don't know Martial Arts?

No

It says so on your resume
that you know Martial Art

Is there Martial Art in this commercial?

I thought it was for toothpaste

Where are you from?

New York City

Queens, actually

But I went to Dolton, so

I retain the same leader's arrogance
No, I mean what's your ethnicity?

I'm Chinese

Speak Chinese?

Not fluently

It says here speaks Chinese fluently

I'm sorry, is there Chinese in this commercial?

I thought it was like

OK, thank you very much for coming, Liam

What? That's it?

I didn't even get to read yet

Well, we are looking for Japanese, actually

~~~SHANGHAI KISS~~~
Trasscript and Subtitle by

Don't be sad

What

You look sad, don't be.

It's my car

You know I just got told

because of a few parking tickets

which is why I guess I'm here utilizing L.A's
fabulous public transportation system

Well, somebody told me, I don't know who?

Whenever you're sad and blue.

And you are feeling all alone and left behind

Just take a look inside you, and you'll find

You gotta hold on, hold on through the night

Hang on, things will be all right

Even when it's dark, and not a bit of sparkling

Sing-song sunshine from above

Spraying rays of sunny love

Hey, that's...

'Rays of sunny love' is great

But I still don't have my car

Well, think of it on the bright side

What side?

You never would have got to meet me so if you use

Do you wanna get a cup of coffee with me?

You see if I go home now, that I'm going home alone

And it's a little scary

How old are you?

Why? Is it illegal to share
a caffeinated beverage with a minor?

I really shouldn't

I mean, just wouldn't be logical

What if I'm the one?

The wine?

If I am then you'll feel pretty stupid
not having a cup of coffee with me

I guess so

I mean I'm not saying I am the one

There's just always the possibility, you know

And isn't that what life's about, possibilities

I really shouldn't.

You can do anything you want to

It's the beauty of living

Wow

Every time I go out for something, Jo

It's always for some Kung Fu
Deli Store, Computer, Chinese...

You are a little Chinese guy

You are gonna go out for roles for little Chinese guys

I was born in New York

How about a role for somebody born in New York

Nobody asked you to quit college

And try your hand on deluquative(?) world

Of motion picture and tele-magnetic

What am I gonna do with the degree

I'm gonna spend 8 hours a day

Trapped in a little cubical

raking one of those desktop Zen Garden

Hey I prefer that over spend all you time
with some Malibu Barbie

Her name is Adelaide

She is a really sweet girl

You haven't even given her a chance

She is 16 years old

She is applying to Stanford

Everybody can apply to Stanford

You want some of that?
At least I'm going online to meet girls

I tell you now

God invented match.com for a reason

And that reason was me

Look, one even applied to me last night

You wouldn't like her though

Why?

She is Asian

Ah

No, but, I'm happy for you

I hope she love you long time

Thank you

Look, I gotta go

It's late, I gotta try to write something

It still blocked, you know

Most of the writers have to write something first

Before getting blocked

You can't be impotent without first being potent

And what the hell was that?

What?

I know that that's your dad calling

Because you got that stupid little ring

So that you know it's your dad calling

And by the way

He knows you sending him to voice mail

He doesn't know shit

Yes he does

Because you pushed end

You can push the end

It only rings twice and goes to voice mail

You're gonna let him go all the way to...

I don't wanna talk to him

Why?
He's the one who support you headiness to...

My dad's a drunk

My dad's insane

You don't know my dad

Forget about your dad

And forget about Malibu Addy

Check out this blonde at the bar

She's gorgeous.

Which one?

The one with the pink...

Sucking on that straw

She knows what she's doing

She is one like 8.9, at least

8.9?
Yeah

Let me tell you something, my friend

This girl represents everything

that was wrong with the society

From a fake tits to a fake nose

That fake fucking smiles

You see that?

It's a fake fucking doll bag

How do you know her bag is fake

You know what's the worst part?

She gets away with that

She gets away without having anything
close enough to resembling a real personality

The bag looks real to me

Let me guess

Capricorn?

Libra

Close enough, you wanna buy me a drink?

What makes think you deserve a drink?

Er, because I'm a good person

By Hollywood standards

Anyway, by normal standards

I'm a fucking asshole

D'you, you think I'm a good person?

Well, I don't even know you

Well, the truth is I think you are really cute

And I was compelled to meet you

And normally I wouldn't surcome to my compulsion so easily

But I'm trying to embrace a new philosophy of life

That involves surcoming

And I mean if I have to surcome

I'm glad I'm surcoming on you

Hey

Think of this drink as...

as an investment for the possibility

of mutual growth in this potential relationship

Any years from now

When our daughter

Jumps to your laps, and asks you

Oh, how did mommy and daddy meet?

You can look at this drink

as the best investment you've ever made

But I gotta know if you're really committed

to continuing this conversation

before I waste my time

I just go, like nothing happens

I'm Georgia, by the way

What a coincident!

That's my favorite confederate state

This is Liam

I'm not here right now, leave a message

This is Mark Liu

Your father

Where are you anyway

It's 2 am

You should be at home

It's dangerous out there you know

so many FPD

I don't want you get hepatitis another time

I hate talking to meet you

You wanna call him?

Sorry

You're not a very rich guy, are you?

What gave that away, the generic brain cooler?

You don't get a lot of stuff

So maybe, maybe I'm not materialistic

Did Jesus have a lot of stuff?

No, but Jesus was poor

So, what do you do for fun?

This is pretty fun

I mean, what do you do for excitement?

Good night

Are you OK?

Yeah, I just, I just have allergies, you know

Are you crying? Your face's wet

No, I'm OK. Just go to sleep

Wake up, wake up

You have to go

What?

Wake up

You have to go

I'm late

Why?

Because I'm late

Why?

Because I'm late

I feel like I'm talking to Helen Keller(deaf writer) here

I promised me breakfast

There's a bagel in the fridge

Knock yourself out

I made you something

What

I love brownies

I know you're silly with them

That's why I made them for you last night

Thanks, you're so sweet

Oh what can I say I'm a sweetie pie

I'm good

What's that?

What's that?

I'm applying to an art school in Paris

What about Stanford

Ah, Stanford is boring
What?

That's what you wanna to for the rest of your life

is paint fruit and people dancing at tea parties?

I mean you're a bright girl

You know you need real education

Shouldn't you do what you're passionate about?

Yes, yes, that all sounds great now

You're doing what you're love

You're doing what you're passionate about

But in 15 years, it won't be so great

When you're selling kind of candy

On Santa Monica prominent

So it's about money

I just don't want you to regret this

I don't know where to go

I have something important to ask you

You're in high school, what's important?

You know canonization is not the way to a girl's heart

I'm sorry

What do you wanna ask me?

I'm sorry, I'm SO SORRY

Oh my goodness

I know, I'm sorry
I can't do it like you can. What?

I was going to ask you

If you want to come to the junior prom with me?

The junior prom. Wow

I'm sorry Addy
I can't go to the junior prom with you

Why not?

Why didn't you go with, with, Alex, Bowta, or Whorethorn

Or whatever they named them nowadays

'Cause I don't love them, Liam

All righty

Out of my car, Kiddo

Who're you calling kiddo? Boss

You know what

You better be careful
'Cause one day you'll gonna lose me.

And it's gonna break your heart into a million little pieces

I could be the best thing
that'll ever happen to you and you'll regret it.

Maybe not today, maybe not tommorrow
But soon, and for the rest of your life.

Now if you excuse me

I have an algebra test to attend to

You're going to prison for roughly 20 years

And I'm not talking about cobber-sins

It's not that, it's not about hooking up

You're the cool older guy right now

Just take her to school in the morning, that's it

Talk to her

That's ridiculous

Why is that ridiculous?

Are you kidding?

Don't you think it's a little psycho
to just walking up to some girl?

You know, the architecture

Very modern

OK

Hi

Hi

I'm Liam

Mickey

You speak English?

You speak German?

Why would I speak German? We're not in Germany

Why would I speak English? We're not in England

Because everybody speaks English

If that's true, then why even ask me in the first place?

Let me guess

You're an American

And you think the world revolves surround you

You probably don't speak any other languages beside English

That doesn't true
I speak Ethiopian

!@#$%^&*()
That means, em, armchair

Well, why don't you speak Chinese?

Because I'm an American

You're not an American

Your face is Chinese

Your hair is Chinese

Your eyes are Chinese

Your skin is Chinese

But you probably don't know anything about your culture

It's a pity you don't even speak the language

I know more than you think

Here is your drink

Yes, I can see you're very wise

Thanks

Thank you

So what are you that you're so culture
the polaties(?) instructor?

What's that?

Never mind

Hey, you wanna get outa here?

This conversation's depressing me

Eat your drink first

So beautiful

I never realized how beautiful Shanghai is

Most of these building were developed in the Opium Wars

Refresh my memory
Robert Donnie Junior won the Opium Wars, right?

Who that?

Never mind

You're so cute, and so funny

Yeah, but you don't laugh at like most of my jokes

You're still funny

Are all American so funny?

You should know
You've been there 3 years, right?

Use sense of humor as defensive mechanism of nervous

That's what my analyst says

You're in analysis?

Yeah
Ever since the second grade

When I asked out Aaron McGrath

She called me the dudie head and
pulled down my pant during recess

That's horrible

I can't really blame her

Because I was quite empirically a dudie head

But then I got very self-conscious about my penis size

Err, I mean, were small, but I was 7

I think for a 7-year-old

It was decent size, I think

Are you nervous?

Yeah a little bit

Do I intimidate you?

You have no idea

How was that?

I'd say let's go back to my place
but I don't know where it is.

Let me get this

Hello?

I wrote you a poem, you wanna hear it?

Yeah, sure

I woke up lonely the day I died.

The sun never sang to me so bright

The songs of heaven that dance inside my eyes

Watching a seagull's flying

And time stands still

As I paint the penguin red and I turned blue

I thought of you and only you.

In the darkness you'll come

And drive my tears and rescue me

From the plastic cups and empty faces

My Shanghai Kid
My One and Only

For you I wait
Only God can stop me

Now if it totally sucks, you can tell me
I really didn't write for 5 seconds anyway

No. I like it

Em, you know, I got to get off the bus

Can I call you later?

Yeah

Bye Addy

What was that?

Your girlfriend?

No, she's just a friend

Just a friend

Give me a break, she's 16

Why are you friends with a 16-year-old?

I don't know

Excuse me

(You make me disgusting)
(You make me puke)

(You make me sick)
(You make me fucking...)

What's that?

Tea egg

Tea egg

Egg?

Egg

Egg, Let's get some
I'm hungry

Hey, tea egg

Hello, hello, hello

Wake up, back to work

Hello, hello, hello
Ni Hao

How much?

1 yuan!

1?
1 yuan?

That's like 12 cents

I want twelve

So, how do you say twelve?

Twelve

(Shi Er)

Is this good?

Wait, hold on

Taste time

Why are you buying so many eggs?

I may not be a smart man

But I know a good bargain when I see one

Wow!

What?

In this light, you're stunning

You're a stunner

I'm actually physically stunned

Well you're not the ugliest guy I met either

OK, OK relax

So, why would you sell a house
that's been in your family for 100 years?

What am I gonna do? Move to China?

Why not?

You're Chinese, aren't you?

Why don't I do anything that makes any sense?

Why did I drop out Columbia and moved L.A.
to being an inspiring alcoholic?

Why is that the the only girl that
I can stand being sober with for more than an hour

present company excluded

happens to be 16?

Why can't I look my father in the face?

You're right!

I spent my entire life
running away from anything Chinese

including my father.

But I come here

And I feel like I belong here

Here I'm not a Chinese guy

I'm just a guy

Don't move here just for me

Do you wanna see me again?

Of course!

Would you miss if I left?

Would you miss me?

You are the most amazing girl I've ever met!

Hey!

Chou Yun Fat?

Hey! We both fat

No no no, I'm sorry
it's not him

It's the guy from Roman Noodle package

And you're the noodle

So, how is the People's Republic

It's amazing

It's so beautiful there, Jo

It really is

And I met a girl

What? I like a Chinese girl?

I met a Chinese girl!

No way! Really?

Yeah
Really?

What's her name?

Her name is Mickey

That doesn't sound Chinese

She is beautiful

She's smart, sophisticated, funny

And she's with you?

It's a shame you had to leave

Actually I'm gonna move there

What?

I'm moving to Shanghai

When?

Next week!

I just, I came back to get some things

Say good bye

It's pilot season

There are no Asian guys on television

You know that

So, did you tell your father?

Does Addy know? Anybody?

No, not yet

You figured how to tell them?

No, I will

Your father's gonna be a little surprised

I don't give a shit what he thinks

Listen to yourself, man!

You're moving to Shanghai for a girl

A Chinese girl, for God sakes

This is not just about the girl

Then what is

It just, it feels right

I'm Chinese, I gotta go back to my roots

Slowdown, Kuta Kinsei(?)

You don't even speak Chinese

What the hell are you gonna do

What, drive a Rig Shark(?)?

I can learn Chinese

Learn Chinese? Liam, you barely speak English

Don't call me Liam, Liam is my slave name

Cute

Wait
Come here, come here

What?

That's her

Wow

She sure likes any other Asian girl in Monterey Park

You wanna move somewhere

Move to Monterey Park, it's lovely

I'm miss you too

Come on, get in

Give me 5 bucks for parking

So you came back early

You know the sell fails, sweetie

Oh, you didn't sell your house?

No

What're you going to do now, baby?

Well, please don't call me baby

Baby baby baby baby BA~BY~

I have something to tell you

Good news?

In a way.

Let me guess

You're pregnant

No, that's the last one

It got it aborted

Oh, that's too bad
I always wanna be a father

So what's this news?

This is hard to say

Oh, spill it, bust it, come on!

Well, I think that we should stop

Oh Sugar salad

Give me those please

Yeah, sure

You're the bestest boyfriend...

Yeah, OK Addy
you're a great girl, you're beautiful, smart, strong

And you shouldn't be hanging arround with me

You should be with the guy at your own age

I'm gonna be 17 like 2 weeks

What are you?
like 8 years older than me?

12!

Big deal

I look like a dwarf
I'm even, almost taller than you

Look, It's not my fault that my
a'pophysial plate feels immaturely

Apo'physial!
Apo'physial!

Did you drink milk?
Yes, I drank milk

Whole 100 percent?

Did you drink fat flavor?

What percent milk I drink is not the point

The point is I can drive and drink alcoholic beverages

Not at the same time

What's your point?

Woody Allen was with a woman 35 years younger than him

Woody has 3 Academy awards

When I get 3 Academy awards
I can date 12-year-olds if I want

I met some one

Really?

Yeah

Is it a girl?

No, it's an squirrel, actually

Of course it's a girl

I don't know, you're barely natural

It's a Chinese girl, I met her in China

What can I get for you?

We're gonna take a sugar salad

You're gone, for like 3 days

3 days!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry

I don't know what you want me to say

I feel so shady now

You don't have to feel shady

Let's go have the sugar salads

Fuck the sugar salad

Fuck her in the sugary ass

You're dumping me for some Chinese girl?

We were never really together

Oh, right. I forgot, I'm only 16

How are you gonna maintain the relationship
with some 7-thousands-miles-away?

I'm moving to Shanghai

What?

I'm moving there

To Shanghai?

Who moves to Shanghai?
No one does that

No moves to Shanghai
I don't know, lots of people

I don't know. It just feels right

You'll just leave me here to rot?

Leave you here to rot?

You live in Beverly Hills for Christ

I wish I live where you lived

Please just go see this movie, please

I'm gonna get you a sugar salad

Don't you have any feelings at all?

You have your grandmother died
Don't you feel sad about that?

Don't you feel sad about anything?
You're like a fucking robot

Now you're going to China for
some girl you've only known for 2 days

Do you really think that you'll gonna find
what you looking for out there?

You need to calm down
I'm going nuts

Wait, just wait

I like you, Addy, I really do
It scares me how much I like you

Why you are leaving

Because I feel empty here

It's like I'm pissing my life away.

L.A. is a cold and desertly place
It really is

It's like sucking my life right out of me

Maybe it's you Liam
Did you ever think of that?

Maybe it's you sucking the life outa yourself

You're just a just a kid. Addy

Go home

Don't go to Shanghai, please

It'll be a mistake, you know it'll be a mistake.

Fell in love, with a girl

Lost my hold on this whole world

Sad to say, it's about truth

There's nothing more that we could do

But Love just don't quit

So hard to see from where we sit

Love just don't quit

It's not a box there ain't no live

Holidays, time of year

Call them close and hold them near

Some souls comes, some don't show

Round and round and round and goes

But Love just don't quit

So hard to see from where we sit

Love just don't quit

It's not a box there ain't no live

Some years past, in a day

Somethings's changing something's faint

Some day seems like nothing's new

You have me and I have you

'Cause Love just don't quit

Hard to see from where we we sit

Love just don't quit

It's not a box there ain't no live

Give it out and let it end

(Check!)

Excuse me, Mister

Do you speak English?

I need an umbrella

Raining, raining

(Excuse me)

(Where to)



The umbrellas right there

Thank you thank you

(raining? raining?)

It's good, you should try it

It's so shiny

I'm gonna get blinded by it

No it's a desert
You'll like it

Let's go to Mc'Donnald
This food is scaring me

That stuff would kill you faster than poison

Somewhere out there is a bunch of angry feet of chicken

Didn't your mother ever told you not play with your food

I don't know I have no mother

Everybody has a mother

You OK?

Yeah, I'm fine, It's just

I don't really remember her

I mean I have memories, but

I don't know which ones are real and
which ones I created because I needed them

We don't have to talk about this

No, no, it's good to talk about it

Well it was my birthday

I was 6

And we were coming home from dinner

We didn't have much money then

So going out to eat was special

So I wanted to order something special

And after looking over the menu for 30 minutes

I saw that they have turtle soap

And I thought, wow
Wouldn't it be cool to go to school on monday

And tell everyone that I had turtle

But on the way to the bathroom

I saw the life turtle
in the Kitchen

And I started crying

I could never eat such a good animal

And so I burst into the kitchen

like a knight rescuing princess

I grab the turtle and I burst out

And after my parents come down the kitchen

My mom said that I could keep the turtle

As a birthday present

So it was sitting on my lap
in the car my father was driving

He may have been drunk

I'm not sure, but they started arguing in Chinese

Every time they argue in Chinese
I know something's wrong

The rest is a blur
The next thing I know

the car is flipped upside down on the side of the road

There's a shart-of-class jetting from my mother's neck

Bloods dripping down her white blouse

I never did find out what happened to the turtle

You wanna go see a movie

You have movies here, right?

Of course

Let me go to the man's room
then we can go see a movie

I can't watch this

Why not?

Because the Rock sounds like Richard Simons
That's why not

Who is Richard Simons?

Never mind

Who's the Rock?

I'm gonna get something to drink
I'll be right back

Hi, you reach Addy
She's not here right now to take your call

I know
'Cause I'm her

Get in the car!

Did you say get in the car?

Why would I get in the car?

(Beat him)

Get in the car? OK? OK?

You hit me

Yes, very good, very smart

People always complaining about American education system

What do you want?

Where are you from?

Here and there, I get around

Where are you from?!

I'm from Los Angeles

California!

It's beautiful there isn't it

It's OK

Beautiful women too

I've never been myself

But I watch Hollywood movies

Like, em, Charlie's Angels

You've seen Charlie's Angels?

It's not one of my favorites

I found the plot to be lack...

Plot?!

Who needs plot when you have
crazy American women running around

Right?

There's something doesn't make sense to me

You see you have Charlie's Angels

And crazy American girls

Yet you still feel the need to come here
and steal our women

I don't know what you're talking about

I'm talking about my girlfriend

Mickey

Lately she's been acting very strange

Always busy

You know what she's doing everyday

I have no idea

Who do you think you are

You American think you can take anything you want?

I don't think that

You don't think that?

Who discovered America?
Who discovered America?!

Christopher Columbus?

I forget

That's want you learned in school, right?

But I want to find out

How he can DISCOVERY a country

with already more than 40,000,000 native Americans

Where are they now?

They welcomed you with open arms

And you killed them all

I guess we have different text book, huh?

Look, I'm Chinese

My parent went to America as Immigrants

You'll never be Chinese

You were raised on cheese burgers and pizza

You may think you have discovered China

But we have been here for thousands of years

And I'm not gonna stand around
watch you take what's right for me

(Stop the car)

Hi, you have a phone that I can use?

Telephone I can use?

You have a...

Hi, you have phone?

(phone?)
(phone?)

Sir
Do you have a phone?

Hey!
Hey!

Ma'm
Ma'm

Can I use your phone?

please, please please

Here, look, look

I give you this

You let me use that?

OK? Can I use that?

I'll give you money?

Look!
Look!

(I'm not gonna sell you my phone)

This is all I have
Take it

(borrow?)

I'll give it right back
I'll be right here

(My long-distance is expensive)

Ma'm, please

Thank you, see, good, happy

Thank you

Mickey!

I wanted to tell you

I really did

But Jai Lee is not the most reasonable man

He gets violent

To beat you?

Who is this guy?

We're to be married

That's terrific

Congratulations

Am I invited to the wedding?

You have to understand
(Sir, what can I do for you?)

A bowl of huntuns please

(I'm sorry, I don't understand)

Huntuns?

(A bowl of huntun)
Yes, thank you

What don't I understand?

Do you love him?

It's not about love

Then what?

I used to work as a waitress

In about a year ago
Jai Lee comes in, throwing his money around

Telling me how beautiful I am
And how he wants to take care of me

So this is all about money

See, that's why you would never understand

What don't I understand?

You are what we call a gold digger

How many siblings do you have?

I don't have any

I have 5

3 sisters and 2 brothers

How much does the average American make?

I don't know

Maybe 35,000

I make 1200 a year

My family, all seven of us

Lived in a one bedroom apartment

My father died years ago

Leaving my mother to raise all of us
All by herself

So no, this is not about love

I'm with Jai Lee to ensure my family have a better life

You are gonna stay in a loveless and
abusive marriage for the rest of your life?

Trust me

There are worse things

(Sir, it's your huntun)

Thank you

You're hungry

Getting the shit beat out of me

Spending the night in a ditch
can be pretty consuming

But on the up side
it did my cardy over the week

Go back to America

What about you?

I'm be fine

(Welcome back here)

(Sorry for last time)

(I've discussed with my cousin...)

Have you ever seen Sinatra concert?

What about Billy Holiday?

How old do you think I am?

Well, my favorite is Nat King Cole

You listen to Nat King Cole?

My mommy used to play a lot of old records
when I was little

She used to sing to me alot

You're still little

What's wrong?

Just miss her, that's all

Just unfair

I mean how can someone die from lung cancer
when they never even smoked

I know what you mean

How?

Em, I don't know
I don't, I guess

Do you talk to you mom a lot?

Every night

Really?

Yeah, right before I go to sleep

You're a good son

Hey Liam

Liam?

Just sign this
And you are all set!

I can't

(The thing is)

(We don't want to sell now)

(Not selling?)

(My cousin come from Amercia)

(He thinks different than us)

(He may have other use for the house)

OK, this was fun

Call me the next time you want to do this

Hey, can you help to transfer the deed to someone else?

I can not accept this

Geese Louise
If you learn anything in life

Learn that when some one gives you a house
You don't say I cannot accept this

You say fuck yeah!

Yeah try it

Fuck yeah!

Alright, we'll work on that

No one has ever done anything like this for me before

All I know is if you marry Jai Lee

You're gonna regret it

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow

But soon, and for the rest of your life

Oh, can you do me a favor?

Before you kicked me out of your house

Any thing

Can you read one of these letters to me?

Of course

This is from your father

My Xiaoyin

I have missed you these past few months

And I regret that I cannot be with you
during this venerable time

I hope that my mother is taking good care of you

Because she is so exited to become a grandmother

I am working hard in Suzhou

To save enough money

For us to go to America

I hope to make enough money

So that we can go before you give birth

I want our son to be born there

So he can become the president of the United States one day

Please know, you'll always be with me

Liu Yi

Wow

Yeah, I'll say

Thanks

Thank you

Thank you for everything

Dad?

Dad?

Dad?

Dad?

Hey

I loved her

I know

I'm sorry

You forgive me?

You look skinny

I'll take you to lunch
No, I'll take you to lunch

I have a job now

I'm paddling Cappuccinos at Starbucks

My son

I cannot believe it

You work for the man

Working for the man

Like kids want to say

Nobody says that dad

Are you sure?

You've been away to long

A kid down the street, say it all the time

Damn, I miss that taste

How about this girl?

Over there, the blonde

Like a 7.6, 7.7?

What do you think?

She's OK

OK?

You don't wanna play anymore?

Jo, did you ever think assigning women
to numeric value between 1 to 10

based on artificial quality is kind of superficial

Liam, if you don't think she's cute

Just say you don't think she's cute

You know what I think

I made a big mistake with Addy

You can come up with a list of
hundreds of qualities that you think are important

in another person

But in the end
The heart wants what it wants

You spend you entire life fighting that

Oh my God

You just you go crazy

Yeah, I'm sorta gone crazy just listening to you

Sorry

So, you could ramble on about it with me

for the rest of the day

Or, or

You could call her

You know what, I'm not gonna call her

I'm gonna go over there

I got it
Thanks

How you're gonna get there?

You've sold your car

I'll walk, I'll run, I'll fly over there

Catch you later

Nobody walks in L.A.

(Excuse me, I'm sorry)
(You see that guy over there...)

Hi
Hi

I made some bad decisions

and I'm trying to get them right

I chopped them where to live in

and stored them out of sight

I've gone reputational

running from a fight

When the situation

is out my hands

Sometimes you've got to go to stay

Let the eastest fades for where it may

Drop the masquerade like a life could make

Give it all away

We had a conversation

it was more than what we've sad

we had a destination

we could see it up ahead

To my imagination run

winds around up my head

Trying not to face that

Slipping away

Sometimes you've got to go to stay

Let the eastest fades for where it may

Drop the masquerade like a life could make

Give it all away

What're you doing here?

I came to see you

And I know
I'm probably the last person you want to see right now

I wouldn't blame you if you slam the door in my face

And I deserve it

I get the door slammed

Who is it, sweetie?

Just, Chinese

Great

Go to Paris

What

I want you to go to Paris

I want you to see the world

I want you to do what you're passionate about

When I was in Shanghai

I had a lot of time to think

Nobody spoke English

And the movies there suck

But, I realized how badly I treated you.

I mean you have so much heart

You can sing to the world

And I always made it seem like you needed me.

You don't, you never did

I'm the one who needed you.

And I was scared

Scared of you growing up

Scared of you wake up one morning

and realizing that you didn't need me

Scared of you going off to Paris

seeing the whole world out there without me.

But I'm not scared anymore.

And I love enough to let you go

You dumped me

And then you have this epiphany in Shanghai

And now you're standing here
basically giving me permission to live my life?

And by the way, news flash

I'm already going to Paris

You are?

Next week

Great

Perfect

That's what I wanted to hear.

You are gonna learn so much

Your are gonna meet so many interesting people

If you are running into Gerard Depardieu
Tell him that I loved him in Green Card

Why do you make it so hard for me to hate you?

God, I'm starving

So, do you need some cash, bunny?

I'm gonna found out?

OK

So where is the food?

I left it at the restaurant

So, this is goodbye?

More like, see you later

I'll just...

That was weird

You read the copy?

Yeah, sure

Just start whenever you're ready

OK

Right into the camera

Do you have genital herpes?

It's just...

Lately...

I've been feeling iching and burning
around in my genital area

And how did this happen to me

I ask myself

Is that girl in Puerto Rico?

I knew she wasn't a virgin.

But will I ever be able to love again?

Will anyone love me?

Am I supposed to spend my entire life alone?

Because of one drunken night?

This is what I felt

Before I tried Provium

Provium daily suppressive therapy can help
reduce the frequency of outbreaks

Make the most out of your life

Ask your doctor if Provium is right for you.

Wow, that was amazing

You know, I really believed you have genital herpes

Do you?

No, I don't

Well I don't think we need to see anyone else

Sorry

I'll miss you!

Go to Paris?!
Stupid!

God damn it

So stupid

Hey

Either you came to see me
or you've ordered a mail-order bridge

I saw you're with that guy.

He is one of my instructors
And he scales like a pineapple

You still remember me?

Bunny, you are my every other memory

How do you know I was coming in?

I called your dad.

God, you're like obsessed with me or something.

I'm more than obsessed
I'm daffy about you

Daffy like a duck?

Daffy like a duck!

Quack! Quack!

Oh these are...these are for you.

Thanks

So you think we have a chance?

Anything is possible

It's the beauty of living.

Moonlight is raining down

And I chose a blazing road

Shining like a pawning tree

The city close a massive rose

Swinging on a high trapeze

Far above the crowds I see

All I need is Love

Spinning around the circus grounds

Take me and bring me home again

I see everything in front of me

It's love and only love can bring us home

Fires burn from sea to sea

Warming me and I am free

Open doors in front of me

Only time knows where they lead

Everything I'll ever need

Standing there in front of me

All I see is love

Spinning around the circus grounds

Take me and bring me home again

I see everything in front of me

It's love and only love can bring us home

Only love, only love

Love, spinning around the circus grounds

Take me and bring me home again

I see everything in front of me

It's love and only love can bring us home

~THE END~
