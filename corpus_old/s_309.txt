We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit, -

there's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

No scripts, no cue cards.

lt isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. lt's a life.

l'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

No way, mister.

You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

You're crazy, you know that?

For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

lt's a noble life.
lt is ... a truly blessed life.

Tell me something l don't know.

All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

lf l die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

You're gross.

lt's all real.

Nothing you see on the show is fake.
lt's merely controlled.

Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

Maybe just your love handles.

l have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

Truman, you're gonna be late.
Okay!

Good morning!
Good morning!

And in case l don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

Morning, Truman.
Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

He won't hurt you.
l know. lt's just me.

Come on, Pluto.

What is it?

An aircraft began shedding parts
as it flew over Seahaven -

a few moments ago.
Luckily, no one was hurt.

How do you feel today .. ?
That's good.

Thinking offlying somewhere?
Nope.

This is classical Klyne.
Forget about the perils offlying -

and let this music calm you down.

''Dog Fancy'', please.
Thank you very much.

Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

That be all for you, Truman?
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

Hank!
Good morning, Truman.

Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

How's your lovely wife?
Good. Yours?

Couldn't be better.

Nice talking to you.
You too. Think about that policy.

Two for one. That's a good deal.
Doppelg√§nger special.

Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

Go ahead.
l'm not that anxious to get there.

Could l have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji lslands.

Truman, did you see this?

l'm sorry, ma'am. lf he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

Nothing listed ...

Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

Nothing ...
Okay, thank you.

Lawrence.
l've got a prospect in Wells Park.

Wells Park?
On ... Harbour lsland?

You know another one?
l can't. l have an appointment.

Dentist, or ... yeah.

You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

They're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

Thanks.

Hello. Ferry's still here, huh?
Thought l might have missed it.

One way or return?
Return.

There you go, sir.

Do you need any help, sir?
You go ahead, l'll be fine.

Hi, honey.

Look what l got free at
the checkout. lt's a ''Chef's Pal''.

lt's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

Wow ... that's amazing.

Truman ... you missed a spot.

That is a beer.

l'm thinking about getting out.
Yeah? Out of what?

Out of my job. Out of Seahaven.
Off this island. Out.

What the hell's wrong with your job?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

l'd kill for a desk job.

You should try stocking vending
machines. Now there's excitement.

Don't you ever get antsy?
Where's there to go?

Fiji.
Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

See here? This is us ...

And all the way
around here ... Fiji.

You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

So when are you gonna go?

lt's not that simple.

lt takes money, planning ...

You can't just up and go.
Right.

l'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

Bonus time
is just around the corner.

Are you coming for a drink?
No, l can't tonight.

l don't like that weather, son.
We should head back.

Just a bit farther. Please?

Okay.
Yes!

Daddy!

You're soaked.
Where have you been?

We can scrape together 8,000 ...
You and Marlon ...

We can bum around the world.
And then what?

You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe l feel like a teenager.

We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

lt would be an adventure.
We were going to try for a baby.

lsn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait.

l want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

You want to be an explorer ...

This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

''Dog Fancy'', please.
Thank you.

Paper, Earl, please.

l might as well get one of these.

For the wife?
She's got to have them.

Anything else, Truman?
That's the whole ball of wax.

Dad?

Hey, what are you doing?

Get out of the way!

Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

lt doesn't sound insane at all.

l see him ten times a week.

l almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon ...

lt was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

lt's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

They never found Dad's body.

lf it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

Just like you.

Sweetie ... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

You sailing off into that storm ...

But l've never blamed you.
And l don't blame you now.

Truman ..?

What are you doing down here?

Fixing the mower.

l saw my father today.
l know.

Your mother called.

You shouldn't upset her like that.

What did you want?
l made macaroni.

l'm not hungry.
You know ...

We ought to throw out that mower.

Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

What's he doing?

They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

Are you okay?
Excuse me. Sorry l fell on you.

l've been such a klutz all day.
l must have sprained this ankle.

l'm so sorry to fall on you.
Don't worry about it.

l'm Meryl.
Hi, l'm Truman.

Truman, you've studied enough.
l've got to commit this to memory.

Come on, an ice-cold brewsky.

You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

You're a better person than l am.

See you later.
Bye.

See you later, loser.

Hi.

Konnichi-wa.
What?

You take Japanese.
Oh, yes ...

Lauren, right?

lt's on the ...
Lauren, right.

l'm Truman Burbank.
Yeah, l know.

l'm not allowed to talk to you.
Really?

l'm a pretty dangerous character.
l'm sorry. lt's not up to me.

Girls have got to be careful.

You have a boyfriend, right?
lt's not that.

Was it Meryl, the girl l was with?
We're not ... We're just friends.

lt's nothing like that.
lt's how l look? Not your type?

No.

l was wondering that myself.

Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

Like, Friday? Saturday?
l can't.

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

We have finals tomorrow.
Yeah, l know.

lf we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

So what do you want to do?

Please keep your hands
inside the car!

This is my favourite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

We have so little time.
They'll be here any minute.

They don't want me talking to you.
Then don't talk.

They're here.

What do they want?
Listen to me.

Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending. Understand?

My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

Who are you?
Her father.

l've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

Everything l've told you
is the truth.

lt's fake. lt's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

l want to know what's going on.
Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

Hypnotism, shock therapy ...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

She brings all her boys down here.
Truman, he's lying!

Get out of here. Come and find me.

l'll see you in school.
We're moving to Fiji.

Sylvia! Hey!

Why didn't he just follow her?
His mother got really sick.

He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

l can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

Close, but no cigar.

Another beautiful day in paradise.
But don't forget to buckle up.

He's heading west on Stuart.
Stand by, all extras.

He's turning onto Lancaster Square.

My God, he nearly hit her! Something
is wrong. Change frequencies.

Sorry about that, folks. l guess
we picked up a police frequency.

lt's classical Klyne, and we've
still got some great music ahead.

But buckle up. Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

Can l help?
l have an appointment.

What's happening?
Nothing.

Just tell me what's happening.
We're remodelling.

lt's none of your business.
Tell me, or l'll report you!

You're trespassing.

Marlon!
Truman, what are you doing here?

l've got to talk to you.
l'm on to something big!

You look like shit.
l think l'm mixed up in something.

A lot of strange things
have been happening.

The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it ...

And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything l'm doing.

This is one of your fantasies.
l think this is about my dad.

l think he's alive. l'll tell you
about it later. l'm being followed.

Who?

lt's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

How about those two?
Could be.

lt's when l'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't ...

Anything happen ..?
We have to get out of here.

You ready to go?
l can't.

You're gonna get us both fired.
Okay then, let's do it.

Whatever you say, l'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

Maybe l'm being set up
for something.

You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

No.

When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

l went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

Look at that sunset. lt's perfect.

That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

Just between you and me, Marlon ...

l'm going away for a while.
Really?

Little Angel.

My little clown ...
Old carrot-top.

The best photos ...

We should be getting you home.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

lt looks so small.
Things do, when you look back.

Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne ...
Doesn't she look beautiful?

Well, she still does.

There's room for baby photos. l want
to hold a grandchild before l go.

We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

Your favourite show is coming on.
And we have something to discuss.

A certain person's birthday.
Oh, l see.

There'll be another ''Lucy'' tomorrow.
Now it's time for Golden Oldies.

Tonight we present the classic:
''Show Me the Way to Go Home''.

You don't have to leave home to
discover what the world is about.

We learn that no one is poor
who has friends.

Full oflaughter, love, pain,
sadness, but ultimately, redemption.

The cherry scene will have you
splitting your sides with laughter.

There'll be tears, too, when
David and Jennifer are reunited.

Let'sjoin the Abbotts
in Camden Village.

Thank you, Sweetie.

l need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

l'd love to, but l'm really late.
What's your rush?

There was that elevator disaster.
lt was on the news.

The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

Anyway, l have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

She's very young. lt's sad.
Wish me luck.

l'll cross my fingers for you.

Excuse me. May l help you?

l'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. lt's very important.

That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

Sure ... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

l had to go to Fiji.
l'll call when l get there.

When you get to Fiji?
You got it.

Fine. l'll tell her.
Thank you so much.

Sorry.

Let me help you with that.

He's here.

Scalpel.

l'm now making
my primary incision, -

just above the right knee.

Nicely done.
Unless you're family ...

lt's just a beautiful job.
l'll let someone else tidy up.

l'm sorry to keep you.
That's okay.

How can l help?
l'd like a flight to Fiji.

When would you like to leave?
Today.

l'm sorry. l don't have anything
for at least a month.

lt's the busy season.

Do you want to book the flight?

l'll make other arrangements.

Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

Thank you.

Windy City, here we come.

Hi!

Hello ...

Mom, isn't that you know you?
Face the front.

Everybody off, we've got a problem.

l'm sorry, son.

Wasn't his father from Chicago?
His father was from Des Moines.

Why does he want to go to Chicago?
He's not going anywhere.

Truman?

Honey, are you okay?
Get in.

Truman ...
Look.

l predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

Truman, please ...
Look!

Lady ...

Flowers ...

And ..?
And ...

Truman, this is silly.
There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

You know how l did that?
They're on a loop.

They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

l invited Marlon to barbecue ...
l won't be here.

We need more charcoal.

Are you listening
to a word l'm saying?

You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

Okay, go.

l think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

l'm going to take a shower.

Let's go now.
l'm ready. Why wait?

Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

Truman, what are you doing?

Truman ...
Where shall we go?

Truman, where are we going?
l guess l'm being spontaneous.

Somebody help me!
l'm being spontaneous!

Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

What about Atlantic City?
No, you hate to gamble.

That's right, l do.
But l never have.

And that's why people go places.

l think l'm going to throw up.
Me, too.

Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronised, don't you think?

You're blaming me for the traffic?
Should l?

Truman, let's go home.

You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

lt'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

l'm sorry.
l don't know what got into me.

Can you please slow down?
Yes, l can.

That's our turn-off.
l changed my mind.

What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
lt's magic.

Let me out. lf you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

l think l'd like a little company.

Oh, Truman ...
You knew this would happen.

You know you can't drive over water.

Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

Give me your hand ...
You drive!
