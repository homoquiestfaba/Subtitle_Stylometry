[ringtone playing]

[grunts softly]

[phone beeps] [sighs]

[inhales sharply]


Dinner's almost ready.

Wha... What...

Where... Where am I?

How did I get here?
Where's... my phone?

Where's my phone?
Where are my glasses?

Shh, shh, shh.

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Calm down.

[tense music continues]

[bell jingling]
[indistinct chatter]

Hi, Isaac. [Isaac]
You're late.

And you broke the
Freezy machine.

It's on the fritz!

[machine squealing, sputtering]

I haven't touched
it. Yeah, you did.

If you hadn't, it wouldn't be
on the fritz, now, would it?

Okay. I'll take a look.

Hey.

Let's checky-check that
gloomy mug at the door, huh?

Better not be
greeting my customers

with that sad-sack shit.


You smell like... failure.


After you're done with
the Freezy machine,

clean up whatever happened
in the bathroom, okay?

Devereaux!

I'm watching you.

[door opens, bell jingles]

[engine starts, revs]

[hard rock music plays
over vehicle stereo]

[tires squeal, vehicle departs]

[panicked whimpering][man]
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, sorry. Hold on.

Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. Shh.

Hold on.

Ch-Charlie? Charlie?

Hi, beautiful.

[woman whimpering]

give you another chance</i>

<i>to remember what
we are together.</i>

[humming along to
"Walkin' After Midnight"]

â™ª <i>I go out walkin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>After midnight...</i> â™ª

<i>Stop.</i> [Charlie chuckles]

<i>How long have you
been filming me?</i>

business. Keep going.</i>

<i>No.</i>

Taste-test the sauce,</i>

<i>and if it's the best
Bolognese you've ever had,</i>

<i>you give me a song.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

gonna love this.</i>

<i>Okay. All right.</i>

<i>Oh, my G... Ah.</i>


<i>maybe a little
too much tarragon.</i>


You owe me a song.
<i>You owe me a song.</i>

<i>You're right. It's
amazing again.</i>

[woman on video] â™ª
<i>I go out walkin'</i> â™ª

Untie me, Charlie.

â™ª <i>After midnight</i> â™ª

Untie me. â™ª
<i>Searching for you</i> â™ª



Charlie, what are you
even trying to do?

I decided to forgive
you for humiliating me.

Breaking up with me days after

my father threw me
off the board was

revealing of your character.

Now, I know I used a little
too much tarragon last time.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, hey, hey,
hey. There you go.

Hi. As I was saying,

I, uh, know I used a little
too much tarragon last time,

but, uh, this time, I
practiced restraint.

What is wrong with you?

Might be the best batch yet.

Seriously?

Please? Mm-mm.

Come on. Come
here. Oh, no, no.

Open.

There you go. There you go.

There you go.



[pained gasping]

You should know I'm not willing
to live the rest of my life

wondering what your
life is like without me.

What? The only way...

that I can move
on... [blade rings]


You know, I hated my
father's hunting trips.

Every year, being dragged
to some English countryside

to trudge acres
of dreary terrain.


I grew an admiration
for hunters.

The patience and precision
it takes to make a kill.


Even though taking a life
at a distance lacks...

a level of intimacy,
don't you think?

I mean, the butchering
process comes close

if you do it right away.



in between the warmth of
another creature's organs.


I only know one other
time I've ever been inside

another's body.


Oh.

No.

I wouldn't end you with
such a barbaric tool.

No.

This is for after.

Because we both know

the most intimate way to
end a life requires...

skin to skin,

heartbeat...

[shuddering breaths]

to heartbeat...

[shuddering breaths continue]

touch.


You can still change your
mind and sing for me.

[humming "Walkin'
After Midnight" melody]

Come on. Sing for me.


[continues humming]

Sing for me!


Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm sorry.

I just, uh... I'm
still a little woozy

from whatever you gave me.

Um, could I have
my glasses, please?

Please?

Can I see you?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving

when things were hard. I...

And you-you didn't tell me why.

I did.

No, you-you didn't.
You just left.

Okay. You're right.
And I'm sorry.

I've just been so stressed with
work at the hospital, you know?

But, um, maybe if-if we talk,

if we go to therapy.

I mean, yeah, that's-that's...
that's all I want.

Okay, okay. Yeah.

Yeah, willing to try.

It's been really hard for me.

I know.

I know, Charlie.

Um, can I please look
at you in the eyes?

Please?

[knife blade scrapes on table]

[sets down knife]



[inhales deeply]


Here.

Thank you.

I just want to
see you, you know?

Will you sing for me?

Uh-huh. Yeah.

[alarm blaring]
[Charlie groaning]

[both grunting]

[suspenseful music plays]



[both grunting, yelling]


[grunting fiercely]

[tense music plays]

[Charlie moaning]

[glass crunching]

Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.



[tense music continues]


[smooth rock music plays]

[music stops]

[bluesy rock music plays]

No, no, you make the
caterers get to the boat

two hours before the
guests. No later.

Gas grades aren't clear.

They're not clear?

They're not clear. I just
pumped 87 into my Beemer

because the markings are
all fucked-up and faded.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

than an inconvenience.

That is a European

luxury vehicle over there.

It should only sip 91 gas.

I want a full refund.

The gas is already in your car.

That is because
you are not running

a professional
business establishment.

I'm sorry, ma'am.

I can't give you a refund
for wrongly pumped gas.

"Wrongly pumped gas"?

That's what you're going with?

What is that smell?

Oh, my God.

This place is
fucking disgusting.

There is no way this
place is up to code.

I am calling the
Better Business Bureau.

I'm gonna have this redneck
shithole place shut down.

What'd you say your name was?

I'll give you a refund.

That's what I thought.


It's gonna take two to
three business days.

three business days."

With an attitude like
that, that's gonna

get you a one-way ticket
to fucking nowhere.

Is it okay if I just...

Few of these? Oh, and...

[blows raspberry]

[door opens, bell jingles]

[door closes]

[tense, atmospheric music plays]

[inhales sharply]

[groaning quietly]


[jarring, tense music plays]

[grunts, yelps]

Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

Please.



Okay.

Oh, shit.


[line ringing]
Come on, come on.

[line ringing]


Please pick up. Please pick
up. Please. Please pick...

is your emergency?</i>

Oh, thank God.

Okay, my name is Emily Kasahara.

I've been drugged and kidnapped
by my ex, Charlie Bellwick.

I don't know where I am, but
I'm somewhere in the forest,

and I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses.

<i>Okay. Where is
the kidnapper now?</i>

I don't know, but I heard him
yell my name, so he's close.

<i>Okay. Well, we're gonna
figure out where you are</i>

<i>and get you help ASAP.</i>

<i>Are location services
enabled on your phone?</i>

No. I thought that
he was using them

to track me, so I
turned them off.

<i>That's okay. I have
your number, so we can</i>

<i>work with your carrier to
determine your location.</i>

Okay. How long until
the police get here?

<i>I won't know until we
locate your exact position,</i>

<i>but it can take up to an hour
to work with your carrier</i>

<i>and local dispatch.</i> What?

Can't you go any faster?

<i>We'll go as fast
as we can, Emily.</i>

Okay, well, I
can't see anything.

Could you video-call me and
guide me to somewhere safe?

<i>Unfortunately, we do not
have video capabilities,</i>

<i>and it's against regulations
to use our personal devices.</i>

Against regulations?
Are you kidding me?

I'm about to get killed.

<i>Emily, can you feel
around for a hiding place?</i>

I can't stay in one place,
or he's gonna find...

[yelps, grunts]
[phone beeping]


Oh... oh, no. No, no, no.

No.

No, no, no. No.

Please, please work.
Please, please, please.

Okay.

Um...

Uh...

[line ringing]

[ringtone playing]

clanking, whirring]


[machine rattles, then stops]

[ringtone continues]

Hello? [Emily] <i>Hello?</i>

<i>Who is this?</i>

It's Sam. Who's this?

<i>Are you 911?</i>

No. Uh...

Oh, sh... I'm... I think...
I think maybe I, um,

accidentally dialed you earlier.

[leaves rustling] [gasps]

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

What?

Shh!

[quiet, tense music plays]


[soft, gasping breaths]

[cell phone buzzes]


Hello?



Oh, my God.

<i>I think it was an animal.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i> I'm gonna go.

No, no, no, no. Wait.

<i>Wait. Can...</i>

Can you do video calls, Sam?

Uh, yeah. Why?

Okay. Listen.

My name is Emily, and
I have been kidnapped.

<i>I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses,</i>

<i>and all that I know is that
I am in the woods somewhere</i>

<i>and my ex is coming to kill me.</i>

What?

Look, I just... I need
you to be my eyes for me.

C-Can you... can you do that?

Is this a scam or
something? 'Cause...

<i>No. I promise you that
this is very real.</i>

If I can't get away from
him, he's going to kill me.


<i>Look, I know that this sounds
like nonsense, but please.</i>

Please, will you call me back?

Why-why don't I
call 911 for you?

<i>Because I already called them,
and their fucking regulations</i>

<i>won't let them video-call me.</i>

<i>They're working to find
my location, but, um,</i>

<i>it's gonna take a while,
so I just... I have to...</i>

I-I don't think that...

My phone screen
is really broken.

If you hang up,

<i>I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to make another call.</i>

I-I don't think I'm the person
to do this for you. I...

<i>All you need to do is be
my eyes for me. That's it.</i>

Please. Look, I need
to keep running.

<i>I need to, and I
can't do it alone.</i>

<i>If I don't...</i>

<i>If I don't, I...</i>

Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay, thank you.

So, um,

<i>just-just video-call me back.</i>

Yeah. Uh, I-I'm...

I'm gonna hang up now.

<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>


[tense, atmospheric music plays]

[deep, shuddering breaths]

Damn it. [sighs]

[pulsing, suspenseful
music plays]

[phone chimes]

<i>Oh, thank God. I got worried.</i>

Sorry. I, um, just
needed a second.

<i>All right, I need to figure out</i>

which way to go, so can
you tell me what you see?

Trees. Yeah. Trees.
You're in a forest.

Okay. Uh, is there a
clearing in any direction?

Uh, uh, yeah, uh, to your left.

Uh, maybe it'll be
faster without the trees.

<i>Great. All right, now, I
need you to look behind me</i>

<i>and make sure he's
not there, okay?</i>

Okay. Uh...

Wait. Stop.


I thought I saw something move.

[door opens, bell jingles]

I-I guess it was nothing.

<i>It was nothing.
It's just, um...</i>

Okay, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I, um... I should... I
should... I should probably call

someone else for you, because
I just... I just can't.

I can't. <i>No.
You're doing great.</i>

<i>Sam, I'm gonna need you to take
a deep breath for me, okay?</i>

<i>In... and out.</i>
[takes deep breath]

<i>Look, I-I know
that this is a lot,</i>

<i>but it's a miracle I got you.</i>

Miracle?

<i>Yes.</i>

A miracle.

Okay.

<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

Yes, I can.

<i>Which way, Sam? Which way?</i>

<i>Okay, stop.</i>

The clearing's to your right.

<i>Right. Okay. Any obstructions?</i>

Um, yeah, there's a-a
tree. Step to your left.

Good?

Uh, yeah. Yeah.

<i>Okay, you're at the field now.</i>

Great. What do you see?

Is there a house?
Um, a landmark?

<i>A road anywhere?</i> Uh...

<i>Um... stop.</i>

I think I see a-a
path across the field.

Great. Okay, let's go. Let's go.

<i>Um, there hasn't
been any sign of him</i>

<i>for a while, which
is good, but, um...</i>

<i>I'll keep doing 360s in case,</i>

<i>and if you see him,
you just have to</i>

<i>give me a shout, okay, and
I'll just start running.</i>

Oh, it sparkles.

<i>And just make sure that
I don't trip on anything.</i>

Hey, um, are you sure I can't

<i>call, uh, family or friend,</i>

<i>have them call you back?</i> What?

<i>No. I haven't memorized a
number since middle school.</i>

<i>Uh, it's just I'm at
work, and-and I am...</i>

I'm so not good
under stress, like...

<i>Can you see your own hands, Sam?</i>

Yeah.

Then you are
better-equipped than me.

Right, uh...

Please, listen. Um...

God, I'm so jealous.

<i>Uh, I-I've had shit
eyes since I was a kid.</i>

<i>Do you know what they used
to called me back then?</i>

Four Eyes?

Nope. They would scream
"Missu Golightulee" at me.

What's that?

Bullshit in <i>Breakfast
at Tiffany's.</i>

You never saw it?

White actor in yellow face
with the taped-back eyes

and, lucky for me, glasses.

Yeah, yeah. I saw
clips on YouTube.

It's-it's horrible.

Yeah, I begged my mom for
LASIK, but I was too young.

Then when I got older,
I chose not to get it,

thinking that
people would take me

more seriously as a doctor

if I had glasses on.

Pretty stupid decision
in hindsight, huh?

You know, when I was little,

the kids playing Power Rangers,

they would make me
be Rita Repulsa.

Oh, wait, is that the
evil lady with the staff?

Yeah, and the nickname stuck
all the way through high school.

Repulsa was written all
over my senior yearbook.

God, kids can be such shit.

Yeah.

But hey, uh, Rita
was, like, a...

a badass space witch, right?

Yeah. I guess.

[yells in pain]

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just, uh...

Are we near the path yet?

Oh, no.

What?

<i>I'm so sorry, Emily.</i>

What is it?

<i>It's not a path.</i>

It's just a fallen tree.

Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

How could I have thought
that that was a path?

<i>What is... what is wrong
with me? I'm so sorry.</i>

is wrong with you.

Okay? It's fine.
Let's just keep going.

Okay, but what if... what if I
missed sending you a better way?

<i>You didn't lead me back</i>

to the cabin, did you?

No, no, but I...

Hey, it's okay. [sighs]

[Emily groans] What is it?

My wrists are, uh, zip-tied,
and I'm losing circulation.

I got to get 'em off.

Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

And I didn't... I
didn't even realize.

Okay. Uh, hold on.

Let me see.

<i>Okay, I'm gonna stop for a
sec here, so you just have to</i>

check behind me to make sure
that he's not here, okay?

<i>Oh, no.</i> What?


<i>Did you see him?</i> What? Oh, no.

No, it's just my-my battery's
low, but don't worry.

<i>Okay? I have a charger.</i>
Jesus. You scared me.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

<i>My phone was fully charged</i>

<i>when I left for my
run this morning,</i>

<i>but I have no idea how
much I have left now.</i>


Maybe if you find me,
like, a rock or something,

I could, uh...

[man speaking
Russian over phone]

Is that Russian?

Uh, I think so. It's a video.

[bird cawing] [sighs]

[cawing continues]

I never imagined
getting murdered

would feel so absurd.

Hey, okay?

No one is getting
murdered today.

Now, Sergei says

you need to use your teeth
to tighten the zip ties.


Yeah. The tighter they are,
the easier they'll snap.

Now, bring your hands
down to your knee

as you bring your knee up.

You should probably
put the phone down.

Okay.

Okay. Yeah.

Ready?

One. Two. Three.


[scream echoes]
[growls softly]


Hold on. Hold
on. <i>Are you okay?</i>

<i>I will be, as long
as he didn't hear me.</i>

<i>Did the ties come off?</i>

Yep.

Yes! Sergei for the win.

<i>Hey, but are-are you okay?</i>

Uh, it cut me up, but there are

no major blood vessels
here, so we're good.

<i>Oh, no. You sure it's okay?</i>

Yep. Perks of
being an ER doctor.

Okay.

Okay, let's go.


<i>around here that
looks promising?</i>


I don't know. I-I
don't... It just...

It all... it all looks the same.

[bell jingles]

[bluesy rock music playing]

[man breathing heavily]

Hey. Uh, if you got
lost in the woods

on one of your hunting
trips, what would you do?

I wouldn't get lost.


Hey, we-we got to go. Come on.

One sec. Uh...

Wouldn't happen.

Right, but just...
just humor me, dude.

I guess my best bet would be

to find a stream, river.

Chances are it'll lead
me to civilization,

if there's any around.


In my belly.

Hello?

<i>One sec.</i>

Four sixty-five.

Four sixty-five for a dog?
That's highway robbery.

Someone might've
left their card.

[cash register beeping]

Keep the change.

[door opens, bell jingles]

[door closes]

Please don't come back.


Okay, did you hear
that? About the water?

Yeah, I heard, but, uh, I
left my divining rod at home.

How do we find a stream, Sam?

<i>Hold on.</i> [sighs]

Okay, it says that birds
can lead you to water.

That, uh, "in the
evenings especially,

following the flight path of
birds could lead you to H2O."

Wait. I heard a flock of birds
fly above me a few minutes ago.

Okay, great. Uh,
which way did they go?

[contemplative music plays]
[birds cawing in distance]

I think it's this way.

<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

[tense music plays]


<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

No sign of him.

I think we might be
safe for a little bit.

Just keep-keep walking, okay?


Damn.

It's starting to get
chilly. <i>Where are you?</i>

<i>It's lukewarm and humid here.</i>

<i>You want to trade?</i> Yeah.

<i>Come on over, Sam.
Take my place.</i>

Um, I'm in Michigan, I-I think.

Unless he crossed state lines.

<i>Where are you?</i>

[machine squeaks, burbles]

Uh, Florida.

Oh, man.

Florida, beaches.Shit.

Do you live near the ocean?

No, uh, Tallahassee is a
few hours from the ocean.

Used to, though.

Uh, Jacksonville's a couple
minutes from the water.

I loved it.

Why did you move away?

A lot of things.

Yeah.

I can't believe you're a doctor.

You look so young.

Yeah, it's the bane
of my existence, Sam.

Even interns make Doogie
Howser jokes at me.

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

Oh, it's okay. When
I'm 70, I'll look 40,

and no one will
force me to retire.

Can I, um... can I
ask you a question?

Sure.

What pushed you to be a doctor?

My mom is an ER nurse, and
she worked crazy hours, too.

So when I was little,
I made this vow

that I'd become a doctor

<i>so that I could be
in the hospital, too,</i>

<i>and we could spend
more time together.</i>

<i>It didn't exactly turn
out that way, but, uh,</i>

now I just... I want
to work really hard

so that I can give her
an easier life, you know?

That's really nice.

Yeah, uh, but...

you know, she...

she hates flying alone, and...

<i>and she kept asking me when I'd
be able to take time off work</i>

<i>so that I could go with her
to visit my grandma in Japan.</i>

But I never did. I
never did, and, uh...

<i>You know, it's, like, the
only thing that my mom,</i>

<i>like, ever asked of
me ever, and now...</i>

I don't know...

I don't know if I'm gonna, uh...

No. Okay? No.

Um, you're...

you're gonna buy tickets
just as soon as you get back.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

[Emily sighs]

<i>You said you were a cashier?</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah, at this-this</i>

really weird
gator-themed gas station.

<i>It's a dream career.</i> Hey,
well, at least it's...

No. Uh-uh.

No, don't try and make
it something it's not.

<i>Okay? It's what was available.</i>

Well, they need
cashiers everywhere.

<i>You could go back
to Jacksonville,</i>

<i>work at a gas station
near the beach.</i>

[toy squeaks] Uh,
yeah, yeah, I just, um,

got to take care of
a few things first.

<i>How long have you worked there?</i>

Um, few years.

I, uh... I moved
back to help my mom.

And then she had
some health issues.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Well, how's she doing now?

She's not. She...

She passed, so...

Oh, I'm so sorry, Sam.

But hey, you know,
that-that is admirable

that you stopped your
life to help her. I mean,

<i>I'm sure she's really grateful</i>

<i>that you were there
for her, you know?</i>

Yeah.

Maybe, yeah.

<i>Wait. Do you hear that?</i>

I hear water.

<i>Can you see anything?</i>

Uh, not yet.

Just keep going, okay?

Okay.

[quiet, tense music plays]


[thunder crashes]

found a lot of water

but not the kind
we're looking for.


<i>See anything?</i>

Uh, not yet.

Wait, wait.

<i>I see it. Okay, there's...</i>

<i>There's a river down below.</i>

Oh, great work, Sam. Yes. Okay.

<i>All right, let's
get me down there.</i>


Hey, oh, um, careful.

It's a drop-off.

Um, let's just find
an easier spot,

uh, for you to climb
down. [machine grinding]

Okay, okay.

Tell me when you
see something, okay?

Son of a bitch.

[phone beeps] <i>What?</i>

No, no, no, no, no.

Sam, Sam, is it still too steep?

<i>Hey, Sam, Sam, is it
still too steep here?</i>

Um, just-just hold
on, okay? Just...

<i>Yeah?</i>

Um, shit. Just hold
on one second, okay?

[Emily screams]

<i>Ah, shit!</i>

Shit. [Emily yelping]

[Emily grunts]

Emily, are you there?
Emily, I can't see you.


Emily, are you okay?

Oh, God. [Emily groans]

Ah, shit.

Thank God. I can't see you.

<i>I have my earbud, but
I dropped my phone.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i> Okay. Okay.

Where are you, Sam?

<i>Um, I'm...</i>

I'm looking away from the
river, uh, towards the forest.


Okay, um... God, I'm sorry.

Okay, I was distracted. Okay.

<i>I think I'm going away
from the river. Hold on.</i>

[machine burbling] [muttering]

Stay.

me yet? <i>No, not yet.</i>

Can you see any movement?

No.

I think I see some
grass or, um...

There's a forest.

I don't quite know.

[grunting, panting]

[machine creaking,
sputtering] No, come on.

Maybe if I just...

[machine powers down] [sighs]

Okay.

[music playing in
distance] [gasps]

Wait.

[vehicle driving nearby]
I hear an engine.

That's great. That's great.
Okay, let's go find 'em.

I think he's here.


Oh, no, no, no, no. I see him.

<i>You're okay.</i>

<i>To your left, to your left.</i>

<i>Yeah, right there.
No. Shh, shh, shh.</i>

[engine idling]

â™ª <i>I go out walkin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>After midnight</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Out in the moonlight</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Just hopin' you may be</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Somewhere out walkin'</i> â™ª
[vehicle door opens, closes]

â™ª <i>After midnight...</i> â™ª


He's right above you.

â™ª <i>Miles along the highway</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Well, that's just my way</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Of saying I love you...</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Searching for you...</i> â™ª

[suspenseful music plays]

â™ª <i>I go out walkin'
After midnight...</i> â™ª

Okay, he's walking
away. He's walking away.

<i>Okay, he walked past the truck.</i>

<i>Uh, I think that he's just,
like, going into the woods.</i>

<i>Um, I think it's safe</i>

to just-just go-go... go
straight in front of you.

<i>Okay? Go straight
in front of you,</i>

<i>and then reach out, okay?</i>

â™ª <i>Of saying I love you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm always walkin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>After midnight</i> â™ª
<i>Careful.</i>

â™ª <i>Searching for you...</i> â™ª
<i>You're almost there.</i>

<i>You're almost there.</i>

Now just keep going,
okay? Just keep going.

You're gonna...
you're gonna find me.

[Emily grunting]

<i>Ca-Can you see me?</i>

Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I see you.

Thank God. God,
Emily, I'm so sorry.

<i>Oh, God, I'm so sorry.</i>

It's okay. It's okay, Sam.

But we got to go.

He's still really
close to us, okay?

Okay, so, um... okay,
now go to your-your right

<i>and head downriver.</i> Right.

<i>Yes. Just keep
going.</i> Okay. Okay.

<i>Uh, c-careful.</i>

<i>Careful.</i> [grunts, gasps]

â™ª <i>I go out walkin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>After midnight...</i> â™ª

What's... what's that sound?


It's a video of me he took
when we were together.

It's playing from his car.

Why?

Oh, that's Charlie for you.

Always fucking
theatrical. [panting]

â™ª <i>I walk for miles</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Along the highway</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Well, that's just my way</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Of saying I love you...</i> â™ª

<i>Do you see him?</i> Uh...

<i>No, I don't see
him near the car.</i>

<i>He's gone. I don't
know where he is.</i>

<i>Just head downriver, okay?</i>

That's a good way to
go. [hisses in pain]

<i>No.</i>

What?

We're going back up.

<i>No, just keep going downriver.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i> Nope, we're
gonna get his car.

<i>What? No, we can't drive a car.</i>

We have to. <i>Emily!</i>



I'm up. I'm up.

Where's his car?

<i>Are you sure about this? Okay.</i>

He could be back
at-at any minute,

and then we should
just keep heading

<i>downriver, just...</i> We
can't outrun him, Sam.

Yeah, but there's...
there-there is...

there's no way that I'm gonna
be able to-to help you drive.

You know, just, what if...

Sam, where is his car?


Right.

Go right.

Okay, you're headed
towards the driver's side.

Just keep walking.

Turn left for the door.

Reach out.

Did he leave his
key in the ignition?

Yeah.

Yes! What a fucking fool.

He's here.

He's here. Duck.

Start the engine. Go. <i>Wait.</i>

<i>Is he coming towards
us from the front?</i>

Yeah, yeah. Start the car.

Tell me when he's back
right in front of us.

What? Why?

If something happens, I don't
want him coming after me again.

We have the advantage now.

Let's just... let's
just stop him for good.

What are you gonna do? Are you
gonna try and run him over?

No, let's just go, okay?

Tell me when he's here.

Oh, my God, Emily.

<i>Is he there?</i>

Not yet.

<i>Now?</i> No.

[tense music plays]

<i>Now!</i>

[engine starts]

[energetic, suspenseful
music plays]

<i>Oh, my God, you got him!</i> Yes!

<i>Wait. Stop. Brake! Brake!</i>

[tires squeal]

Emily!


[steam hissing]

[Emily groaning, panting]

[neck cracks]
<i>Emily, are you okay?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

We got him, right?

<i>Yeah. Yeah. Are you okay?</i>

I mean, I'm alive.

fractured.</i> Okay.

<i>Where are you?</i>

Uh, uh, it flew onto the floor.

<i>To your right. To your right.</i>


I don't know.

<i>Here, look.</i>

I can't see him.

<i>I can't... I... Let's go.</i>

<i>Emily!</i> Okay, okay.

<i>We got to go.</i> [engine starts]

Sam.

It-it's stuck, Sam.
It's... Fuck, it's stuck!

<i>Shit!</i> What's stuck?
What's stuck?

Sam, the car, the car is stuck.

What do we do? <i>Oh, no.</i>

<i>Shit. I don't know.</i>


[engine shuts off]

<i>What-what's going on?</i>

<i>Sam, do you see anything sharp?</i>

Uh...

No? <i>Uh, no.</i>

How about here?

Uh...

I don't... I don't see
anything. Oh, wait, there.

There's, uh, a piece of
mirror on the ground.

Tell me when you see it.

<i>It's right there,
right in front of you.</i>

<i>Reach out. Be careful.
Careful, it's sharp.</i>

You got it? <i>Yeah.</i>

Why-why... What are you...

Do you see him?

<i>Um... um...</i>

Uh, uh...

Just keep going around the car.

<i>Do you see him
now?</i> He's there.

There, on your left.

Um, he's on the ground.

Direct me to him, Sam.

Emily, what are you doing?

Let's go, okay?

<i>Just go.</i> I need to
know if he's dead.

[tense, atmospheric music plays]

He's still breathing.


<i>I'm gonna end this now.</i>

Emily, what are you doing?

You have no idea what this
man has put me through, Sam.

Emily, this isn't you, okay?

No, I don't... I don't know,
but let's just go, okay?

If he just left me alone, none
of this would've happened.

<i>No, but don't do it, Emily.</i>

<i>Whatever you do,
don't do it. Just...</i>

<i>I can get you out of
here. I got you, okay?</i>

<i>Let's just get out
of here. Emily...</i>

Emily, he's moving. Please.

<i>Emily, Emily.</i>

<i>Emily, please. Emily.</i>
[Charlie groaning]

[Emily panting]

<i>Emily, he's moving. Please!</i>

Okay.

Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


<i>But I'm keeping this
just in case, okay?</i>

Okay. Okay. <i>Now...</i>

Which way? Which way?

Um, uh, let me see.

Okay, let's, um...

<i>T-To your right, okay?
Just keep going straight.</i>

<i>It's clear for a while.
We'll just... we'll walk</i>

<i>above the river, okay?</i> Okay.

<i>He looked really hurt.
We're safe for now.</i>

<i>Just keep going.</i>


[phone dings]

Fuck.

Oh, fuck.

<i>What did you say?</i>

Emily, uh...

Emily, I'm gonna have to, uh...

<i>What?</i> Ah, shit.

Uh, I'm gonna have to
start making some calls.

To do... to do what, Sam?

<i>To find another phone.</i>

<i>I broke mine. I can't
charge it anymore.</i>

What do you mean,
you broke your phone?

<i>It snapped. I...</i> When?

Earlier. You fell,
and then he...

So, why didn't you
tell me earlier?

Why didn't you tell
me when I fell?

Emily, the charger
broke off on the phone,

and now it-it's stuck, okay?

How could that even happen?

<i>I... I don't know. Oh.</i>

Oh, shit, there's a stump.

<i>Step.</i>

Okay.

Is there somebody at your
work who can lend you a phone?

Uh, no. No, I'm alone.

<i>A friend that can bring you one?</i>

Shit. No, let me think.

Let me think. Let me think.

Oh, fuck.

Um...

No, no. [vehicle approaching]

[rock music plays on car stereo]

â™ª <i>She'll put you
Under her spell</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause she's
Batshit crazy...</i> â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

Shit.

[tense, atmospheric music plays]

[inhales sharply]


â™ª <i>She'll send you
Straight to hell...</i> â™ª

Shit.

[rock music continues
over car stereo]

Hey, uh, Emily.

Okay, quick, give
me your number.

Did you get a phone?

I will in a sec, okay,
but if my phone dies,

I need your number. <i>Okay.</i>

Eight, one, zero,
one, four, seven,

<i>zero, one, eight, five.</i>

Eight, five. Okay.

All right. Got it.

Okay. My eyes might
have to leave you

for a second, okay,
so be careful.

I'm gonna try and borrow
this woman's phone.

<i>Oh, no, Sam, Sam.</i> What?

Sam, I hear footsteps.

He's already caught up.

No. Already? Okay, show me.

No. Not the '98.

He was saving that
for the mayor's gala.

The '03 ChÃ¢teau Margaux.

I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

You were so rude earlier
that I left my Amex.

Um, just give me a moment, okay?

Absolutely not.

I am missing my <i>fÃªte de yacht</i>

because of you, because
of how rude you were.

You probably don't speak French,
but that means "yacht party."

Okay, just give me
one second, okay?

There is a woman who is
about to get murdered.

What kind of crack
are you smoking?

Shit!

Shit, Emily! He's headed
straight for you, okay?

<i>Turn around! Go!
Go! He has a gun!</i>

headed straight for you!</i>

Excuse me. Turn around!
Turn around! Go!

Excuse me. Excuse me. Go!
He's got a gun, Emily!

Straight. Straight. Yeah,
stop. Excuse me. Excuse me.

Excuse me, I'm standing
in front of you.


A paying customer.
No. No, no. No, no.

No! What could
be more important

than what... Hey!
No! Emily, no!

Sam?

Sam, Sam, Sam.

[footsteps nearby]


[snaps fingers]

Hey. Go get my card.

Hey. Can-can-can I use
your phone, please?

You think I'm gonna let
you touch this? Ew. No.

Please. There...
there is a woman.

I answered her call today...

All of this, I don't
give a shit about, okay?

Just scurry back into your
cage and get me my card.

[ringtone plays] What now?

Please.

Please. [snaps fingers] Go.

Well, just slow down.

Oh, that... that is bullshit.

Oh, fuck wind speed.
You tell that driver

he is not weaseling out of
this just to keep our deposit.

[speaks French, scoffs]

You're a... [speaks French]

Do you know what that means?
That's "shithead" in French.

Cut off some of the
Williams Sonoma cheese,

but don't eat any

until I get back.

I'll be there in ten.

[Carol yelps]

Little bitch! Fucking...



Fucking trailer trash cunt!

Give that back to me now!

Eat all the Williams
Sonoma cheese you want.

[Carol panting] [phone beeps]

[tense, atmospheric music plays]


[footsteps continue]

You know, in the wild,

there are these,
uh, pack hunters.

Animals that rely
on others to live.

But, you see, I have
always seen myself...

Shut up!

Shut the fuck up!

I am so sick of your blah,

blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah!

No one wants to hear
you talk, Charlie.

I mean, you think of yourself as

this modern-day alpha
male philosopher?

Well, you're just a spoiled,

rich trust-fund kid that
parrots back bad TED Talks.

Yeah! They're bad!

I called 911.

They have your name.

They're tracking my location,

and they're on
their way right now.

What, are you still gonna
go through with this?

You're gonna get
caught, Charlie.

Sure.

But there's a difference
between getting caught

and being convicted.

You don't get to do this to me

and get away with it.

[Emily gasps]

[tense music plays]

Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

I don't care, Charlie.

I don't care.

Kill me if you want, but you,

you do not get to murder
me and play the victim.

I am the victim.

Are you kidding me?

No, the victim of
your abandonment.

Neglect. My...

After I gave you everything.

The romantic surprises,

the trips, the
emotional support.

Are you forgetting the jealousy?

Are you forgetting the stalking?

The holes in my
wall? The bruises?

Well, you pushed me there.

Look, how am I supposed to feel

when you would rather
spend 100-hour weeks

with disgusting sick
people than with me?

But you're so addicted
to the validation

that you get at
work... I am not.

What you will never
understand, Charlie,

is that some people do things

for other things
besides validation.

I work my fucking ass
off so that my mom

can have a better
life. Your mom?

It's not for your mom!

God, how many times did I
see you ignore her calls?

You see, the truth is, Em...

Do not call me that.

You've convinced yourself
that you work so much

to be a good daughter,

but it actually makes you
a fucking horrible one.

A horrible daughter

and a completely
neglectful partner to me.

what you do, Charlie.

You find what hurts in people,

and then... and then...

and then you use
it like a weapon.

Doesn't mean I'm wrong.



[Charlie growling] [gasping]

[both grunting]

Stop.

No! Stop!



Fuck!

Hey, fuck. I want my fucking
phone back, you bitch.

For the last time,
it's an emergency.

Whose fucking emergency is it?

It's not my emergency.

My emergency is that you
took my fucking phone!

I'm not afraid of you.

All right.

You want a fucking war?

You got one.

You better start
fucking praying.

[bell jingles]
[wind whistling]


Okay.

Fuck. I thought it
was in this one.

No, no, no, no, no.


[tense, pulsing music plays]


Nobody does this to me.


[bell jingles]

[tense, rhythmic music plays]

Where are you, you gator fuck?

[trembling breaths]

Come out, come out.

You hiding from
me? Shit. Shit.

Got a little surprise
for you. Okay.

Don't shoot, okay?

I can't afford to get shot.
I don't have insurance.

You deserve a bullet for putting
your filthy hands on my phone.

That case costs more
than you make in a year.

It's 24-karat gold.
Now, hand it over.

Okay. Now!

No, not on the f...

You fuck! [groans]

[lock clicks]


Okay.

What? What does it say?

[gun fires] [yelps]

[shuddering breaths]

[tense, building music plays]

[music crescendos]


[bell jingles]

Call Hubby Wubby.

Fuck. Okay.

[panting, muttering]

[whimpers, grunts]

[coughing, gasping]


[sharp, gasping breaths]


[phone beeps] [automated
voice] <i>We're sorry.</i>

<i>Your call cannot
be completed.</i> Okay.

Eight, one, zero,

one, four, seven,
zero, one, five, five.

[line ringing] Okay. Uh...

[fax machine answer
tone blaring]

Man, what the hell? Okay, um...

Three, eight. Three, eight.

Okay. Okay.

Call. Okay. [line ringing]

Okay. Okay. [phone clicks]

[man on phone] <i>Yello?</i>


Eight, five.

[line ringing]

Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

[Emily panting softly]

[ringtone playing
quietly] [gasps softly]


[phone chimes] [Sam] <i>Emily?</i>

<i>Sam?</i> [relieved chuckle]

<i>You found a phone.</i>

Thank God. Are you
okay? <i>Not great.</i>

<i>I lost my earbud.</i>

Um, can you get up?
Okay, we got to go.

We got to do the 360, okay?

It's dark.

<i>Now we both can't see.</i>

Yeah, I can... I can...

I can still spot his
flashlight, though, right?

I'm just gonna lay
here until he finds me.

No, your phone, it
has a flashlight.

I can walk you through,
uh, turning it on, okay?

You're just gonna...

That would just make it
easier for him to spot me.

Okay. Okay.

So, um... so, what
are we gonna do?

Hey.

Sam? Yeah?

None of this is
your fault, okay?

I asked you to do a
pretty impossible thing.

And I'm sorry.

No, Emily. No, no, no,
no, you can't, okay?

I need you to call
someone for me.

Can you do that, Sam?
No. No, let's just...

Let's keep going,
right? Let's keep going.

Call the landline and
put it on speaker.

No, let's just go.
Okay? Let's just go.

The number is...

eight, one, zero, one, two, six,

zero, one, nine, seven.

Hey. I thought you hadn't
memorized any numbers

since middle school.

<i>Yeah, well,
sometimes it's easier</i>

<i>to show a stranger how
much you fucked up.</i>

Please...

don't make me ask you again.

[line ringing]

[woman on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

[Emily sighs]

<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

number you're calling from?</i>

My friend's phone.
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

[voice breaking] I'm sorry.

<i>For what?</i> I...

You were right, and I
should've listened to you,

and I'm... I'm sorry
that I got mad at you.

<i>What has he done to you?</i>

I think that I knew</i>

that you were right,
but I indulged anyway.


didn't come see you more.</i>

<i>That I didn't take off work.</i>

[Emily sobbing]

<i>I always made excuses.</i>


<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

you so much, Mom.

<i>Tell me where you are, Em.</i>


<i>Thank you for everything.
Thank you for...</i>

<i>for making me strong,
and I'm sorry.</i>

me what's going on.</i>

<i>This is probably the last
time that we're gonna...</i>

A light.

Emily.

<i>Emily, there's a light.</i>

<i>A light went on
behind you, okay?</i>

<i>It could be a house.</i>


it. It's not far.</i>


Just get up, okay?

Just get up.

<i>I can barely stand now, Sam.</i>

Emily.

You know how... [sighs]

You know how you said
that you're sure...

you're so sure that
my mom was happy

I was there with
her when she passed?

Yeah.

I wasn't there.

Okay, I needed...
I needed a break.

I needed a break from her
and from her sickness,

and so I went out
and I got drunk,

and I left and...

By the time I got
back home, I...

Shit.

I left her, and she...

<i>died, okay?</i>

<i>And I wanted to leave
you tonight, too,</i>

<i>so bad, okay?</i>

<i>I was... scared.</i>

But you, you asked me to stay.

Okay? So I stayed, right?

And now what? What?

You're just gonna...
you're gonna give up?

No, no. No, you are
not allowed, okay?

<i>You, you are not
allowed to give up.</i>


[sniffles, chuckles]

It's Sam, Mom.

<i>Who's Sam?</i> She's my friend.

<i>Oh. Then listen to Sam.</i>

<i>Goddamn it, get up. Em, get up!</i>

Just get up.


Get up.

<i>Emily, you can do it.</i>

He's gonna find me
no matter what I do.

He's gonna... he's
gonna find me.

I'm not gonna leave you.</i>

<i>Just get up.</i> [mom]
<i>Come on, honey. Get up.</i>

Okay, you just... you
just have to get up.

<i>Okay? I am right
here. I didn't leave.</i>

I'm right here.

Okay? Go. Just get up.

<i>Just get up, please.</i>

Is there really
a light? [crying]

Yes, yes, yes. [mom]
<i>You can do this, okay?</i>

<i>Listen to your friend.
She's gonna help you.</i>

<i>Just come home.</i>

I think maybe I see it.

Okay, trust me.</i>

Okay.

Okay, Sam.

Lead me to the light.


<i>You can do it.</i>

[Emily groaning]

[pained grunting]

[tense music plays]


there. Just keep going.</i>

<i>I see it. Right up ahead.</i>

What is it? <i>It's a barn.</i>

<i>Okay, let's see if there's
a house nearby. Scan.</i>

Okay.

Shit.

I see his flashlight.
Turn around.

Get in the barn.

<i>Straight. It's in front of you.</i>

[panicked gasping]

All right, what do you see?

I need a weapon.

Uh, I see hay, shelves,

some-some sort of chemicals,

um, uh, uh, stairs going up.

What, no pitchfork? Axe? Gun?

No. No, not yet.

God. What else is there?

[rousing classical
music playing outside]

What is that?

[classical music continues]

What the fuck?

[classical music fades]

[ominous music plays]


Sam.

He's close.

<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

Sam, are you there? Hello?

Shit.

Okay. You need to hide. <i>Okay.</i>

All right, which way?
Anything look good?

<i>Um, go to your...
go to your right.</i>

<i>Your right, behind that shelf.</i>

[door banging]

<i>Sam? Hello?</i>

<i>Is there anything here?</i>

<i>Hello? Sam.</i>

Holy shit. What?

[tense music plays]

Oh, God. <i>What happened?
What happened?</i>


[grunts, pants]

Let us in, little bitch.

Go away!

Sam, what is
happening over there?

Open this fucking door!

There-there is a couple here,

and, well, they...
they have guns.

What do you... what do
you mean, they have guns?

I took this woman's phone

to call you, and... Let us in!

Her and her husband,
well, they are not

happy about it, okay?

You ruined my <i>fÃªte de yacht!</i>

Oh, my God. [Carol]
You will pay for that!

you have to call the police.</i>

No, no, no, no. I really...
I really did steal the phone,

so, um, you know, if,
uh... if I call the police,

they're gonna come
and they're gonna...

<i>they would take it away from me.</i>

<i>I need you safe first.</i>

Move back. Okay, baby.

[alarm blaring] Oh, shit.

Sam.

What happened? What happened?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

I just, um... Uh,
why don't you, uh,

keep showing me
the shelves, okay?

Just show me the shelves.

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Okay. Anything here?</i>

No, no, no. Nothing.

Give me the phone.

Give her the phone
back! Give us the phone!

You want to catch one
right between the eyes?

[laughing, indistinct
chatter over phone]

fucking phone back!</i>


fucking ugly piece of shit!

Sam.

What is this?

Uh... [man] Give me the phone.

bitch? Give him the phone!


I have an idea.
[tires squealing]

[heavy metal music

[muffled shouting inside]

fuck is going on here?

Hey! [indistinct shouting]

I own this establishment,
you sons of... Whoa.


Your cunt employee

snagged my new phone,
and I want it back now!

Uh, uh, m-my deepest apologies.

N-N-N-Now! Get up!

Yes, ma'am. [whimpers]

She's been nothing
but a nuisance.

I never should've hired her.

Now!

Yes. [chuckles nervously]


Devereaux!

Open up now.

<i>Ready?</i>

I think so.

Devereaux! [Carol]
Stupid redneck.

You can't even
control one employee?

I'm so sorry, ma'am. Let's go!

Okay. All right. Hey,
Devereaux, I'm calling the cops.

Your ass is going to jail!

Come on! [Isaac] Hello?

I got some trash

<i>that needs taking out.</i>

he's gonna hear

all the noise coming
from over there.

Hey, ball sack, let's go!

Sam, you got to stop the
noise. Open up. Open up now!

You better get in
there right now!

I want this bitch!


Let's go!

He's gonna hear.

<i>I know, I know, okay?</i>

I got to think. I got to

What the... Come on, asshole.

Get in there. Okay.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.


Okay, okay. Okay.

Yeah, yeah. Okay.

I can mute myself. What?

But-but how will I
know when it's time?

No, no, no. I will send you
a text when he's in the spot.

You'll hear a ping.

But what if he doesn't
go to the spot, Sam?

I can't know what's happening

if you can't talk to me. Hey,
hey. We just have to trust

that it's gonna
work. But-but-but...

Just, I have to
mute myself, okay?


No.This is gonna work.

It's gonna work, okay?

He is not gonna beat us.

Open the fuck up!

Push him! Harder! Push him!


No! No!

Emily. Emily.

That's the bitch. That's

Yes.

you please get Emily</i>

<i>to fold her clothes
a little faster</i>

<i>so we don't miss our flight?</i>


<i>Anyway, what's up?</i>

Um, so I wanted to tell you

I'm gonna try and
go back to school.

<i>Hell yes, Sam.</i>

<i>That is what I'm
talking about. Yes!</i>

Yeah, it's, um,
terrifying, but I'm...

I'm excited.

And I was just wondering, um,

could I take you
up on your offer

to help me with my application?

Look over my essay?

<i>Oh, my God, of course.</i>

<i>I would love to.</i>

<i>Yeah, just send it to me
whenever you're ready.</i>

Okay. I will.

<i>Oh, I've been
meaning to ask you,</i>

<i>who were you trying to
call last month, anyway?</i>

I was just trying to
order a pizza, I think.

<i>Pizza? Really?</i>

<i>Wow. Love that a wrong
pizza number saved my life.</i>

Me, too. [phone chimes]

<i>Oh, oh, Lyft is
here. Lyft is here.</i>

<i>Okay, we got to go.</i>
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

<i>Thank you. And hey, I am coming
to visit you after, okay?</i>

Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that.

Okay. Bye. <i>Bye.</i>

â™ª <i>Give them hell</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Get your hands off of me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'll scream so loud</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Your eardrums will
Rattle for days</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Of course you'd have a gun</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You creep, you wouldn't</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Last in a fight
Any other way</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I had so many plans</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And none of them had
Anything to do with you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Gonna fight With
all that I've got</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Because I have
Nothing else to lose</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm fighting for my life</i> â™ª
[voices muted]

â™ª <i>We are fighting
For our rights</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Fought so hard,
I was all tied up</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Eyes blindfolded
With duct tape</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Still threw myself
Out the window</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Because fuck you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You won't get away with it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Give them hell</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Give them hell</i> â™ª

handsome face</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>They said his smile looked
Just like a movie star</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Don't be a bitch, girls</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Learn to be polite</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause that's what
Will get you far</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It's such a
beautiful place</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>How could anything So
horrible happen here?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Perfect time to remind you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>That this shit happens
All the time everywhere</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>We're gonna
give them hell!</i> â™ª
