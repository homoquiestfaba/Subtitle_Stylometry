Father!
Mary!

Papa!

I know you have little for yourself, Father.

Promise me you'll take care of Nello?

Do you still have my drawings?

Yes.

Please give them to my boy...

...to help him remember me.

Even when I'm gone...

...I'll be watching over you...

...my little masterpiece.

God has so much planned for you.

I love you.

I love you, Nello.

I'll always be with you.

Can you hear your mother?

You must listen with your heart.

She talks through your God-given talent.
You even make me look good!

Come on! I'll race you to the village.

Come on!

I'll beat you, Grandpa!
Look at him go.

I'll beat you!

Here you are, Nello.
Thank you.

Good day.

Good morning, madam.
Hello. And good day to you, sir.

What have you been up to now?

Have you forgotten how old you are?

Oh, yeah.

I prefer to think of my spirit as ageless.

Here.
No, no. The boy, the boy.

Thank you, sir.

If you please.

Thank you, ma'am.

Just a moment.

That's for you.

If you please.

Thank you, ma'am.
And this too.

Move!

Move!

You know what, Nello?

I think tonight we'll have veal stew.
Minus the veal, of course.

Grandpa, look.

Is he alive?

Barely.

Who could do such a thing?

Some men have no respect for life.

This is a dog of Flanders.

A hardworking breed of dog.

We can't just leave him here.
Can we keep him?

He can share my food.

He's not hungry.

Well, it takes energy to eat.

Leave it.

Maybe later.

What else can we do?

A little broth and a lot of love.

He's starved for both.

I love you so much. So you'll have to
get better, okay?

It's a magic necklace. It'll heal you.

What's that?

You should draw what you hope to see.

It's too sad, Nello.

That's better.

Grandpa, he's drinking it!
He's getting better.

Well, I'm going to get me
one of those magic necklaces!

That's the spirit.

So, what do you think?

Never underestimate the power of love,
my boy.

He needs a name.

Patrasche.

Your mother's middle name.

Then they'll both be watching over me.

Grandfather, maybe you should
see a doctor.

For him to tell me something I already
know, that I'm old and tired?

I know that.

Grandfather...

...you're never going to die
and leave me like Mother, are you?

Why don't you take Patrasche and
introduce him to Aloise?

No, I'd rather stay here with you.

Come on. Go. Have fun.

You're becoming an old man, like me.

Now we meet Aloise, my best friend.

Don't worry.
She's not a dog. She's just a girl.

Hi, Aloise.

Hi, Nello.

Whose dog is it?

Mine. Aloise, meet Patrasche,
my new best friend.

I thought I was your best friend.

I mean my best dog friend. Just like
Posche is your best horse friend.

Okay, sounds reasonable.

Nello, how come you never go to school?

I don't know.

Is it because you have to help
your grandfather?

I like helping Grandpa.

Besides, who cares about books anyway?

Grandpa?

I seem to be more trouble than help
these days.

You're no trouble.

You just need a magic necklace too.
I got you a present.

I got you a present too.

This was your mother's.

She wanted you to have it
so you would always remember her.

Look at this.

Seems like yesterday I was walking
along the canal with your mother.

This was your mother's favorite place.

Yes, God gave your mother
a wonderful talent.

Just like you.

That looks like the statue of the man
by the cathedral.

It's Peter Paul Rubens.
Your mother's hero.

This was your grandmother, Rosa.

Influenza took her from me.

But, that is my favorite picture.

Your mother drew that for my birthday.

I wish I could've known Mother.

Well...
Why did she leave the village?

Well...

She fell in love. She met your father.

Did you know him well? My father?
Well, your mother was...

She was very secretive about her love.
You know, she had her own mind.

She never told me who your father was,
but...

...well, she loved him dearly. Yes.

But were they in love?

Of course.

Of course they were in love.

Why would you think they weren't?

Of course.

And, you know, she told me that
he was... He was a very good man.

Not feeling too well again, Jehan?

Just a touch of gout.

I'll be fine.
Good.

Now, where's my rent?

I have most of it, Master Stephens.

This is all?

We'll pay you, Master Stephens.
We always do.

You better had.
Sadly, patience is one virtue...

...I do not possess.

Good evening, gentlemen.

I hate him.
No, you never hate.

Never lower yourself to the level
of people like that.

Yes, Grandpa.

<i>Cheer up, Nello</i>

<i>Give me a smile</i>

<i>Where's that smile</i>

<i>I used to know</i>

<i>Soon skies are going to clear up, Nello</i>

<i>Cheer up, Nello</i>

<i>Just be</i>

<i>Glad you're you</i>

Cut it out.

What is it?

Crazy dog!

He wants to help.
That's his nature.

That is a dog's dog.

Don't worry, Grandfather. You rest.
We'll do the milk run today.

A boy and a dog.

I don't stand a chance.

There you go.

Nothing like milk in the morning.

He's healed up real nice.

You did a good job with him.

What's your name, dog?
Patrasche.

If you're going to be seen with Nello Daas
and bear his dear mother's birth name...

...this rope will never do.
Leave him with old William for a while.

Go on. Go draw me a nice picture of Aloise.

I don't work for free, you know?
We'll fix you right up here.

Just think...

...my mother once sat right here.

Just like me.

She was going to become a famous artist,
but then she got sick.

I'm glad my mom never gets sick.
I don't know what I'd do without her.

Come back. You're supposed to be modeling.

Well, models are supposed to get paid,
you know.

Not if they don't sit still.

Aloise, sit...

Thank you, William. It's wonderful.

Such soft leather.

Where did you get it?
Where'd you get it, William?

Your apron!
Oh, no!

Look at your faces!
What have you been doing?

Your father will blame me for sure.

Aloise, your mother's been looking for you.

Coming, Papa.

Look at you.
Who's been painting your face?

Hello, Master Cogez.
Nello, William.

Say, "Bye-bye, Nello. "

Say, "Bye-bye, William. "

Look at you.

Lucky man, Baas Cogez, huh?

Get that milk to town before you
lose your customers.

Clean your face on the way.

Thank you, William.
All right.

Children! Children! Sit down.
Hi, Aloise.

There's a great painting
inside that cathedral.

Grandpa says Mother once saw it.

Wish I could see it too.

Are you an admirer of Rubens as well?
Yes, sir. He's my hero.

I'm sure the great master is happy to
see bright new eyes looking up at him.

I want to meet him.

Rubens passed away many years ago.

Of course, his art lives on.

Great men and their deeds
always do live on.

And that's a comfort.

Please, sir.

Tell me more. I want to become
a great artist too.

You do?

Well, you've made a proper start.

Rubens was a master of every aspect of art.

Composition, light...

...movement.

But he had to study.
He studied down there, around the corner.

Right here in this city?
He was a great teacher as well.

But what made him really great
was that he was interested...

...and excited about everything.

I'm like that.

I'm sure you are.

Michel!

Milk?

Artists of our caliber
should only drink cognac.

Let's see what these characters
are up to, shall we?

Robert Kessler...

...may I present
Master Michel La Grande.

I've studied your painting
in the town hall, sir.

I believe you know his father,
our esteemed mayor.

Of course.

Robert's been studying in London's
Royal Conservatory of Art.

As you can see, he has a lot of potential.
You always had an eye for potential.

Let me introduce you to my friend.

Master Steerns. Robert.

I don't suppose I know his father.
Do I?

Dietrich, please.

Yes, well...

I was prepared to show Robert Rubens'
greatest work, if you care to join us.

I was just on my way,
with my friend, Nello.

Can Patrasche come too?

The priest doesn't allow dogs.

He barely tolerates humans
unless they have...

...potential.

So tie up your friend and then join us.
Okay.

Come, Patrasche.

I'm starting a little salon on Tuesdays.
You should drop by for schnapps.

I'm afraid I'll be busy for the next...

...four or five years.

That, my boy, is what we call
a brushoff.

Not at all. I'm going off to Rome
to paint some murals.

A new commission from the Church.

Really?

Does his Holiness pay well?

I myself would pay to paint
in the city of Michelangelo.

Well, to each his own.

This is the painting, behind the drape.

Now, where's the priest?

Father! We've come to see the Rubens.

Does light hurt the painting?

On the contrary, young Robert.
It's light that brings a painting to life.

So why does he keep it covered?

It wasn't Rubens' idea. His paintings
were meant to be enjoyed by everyone.

As if the masses were interested in art.

Father.

Robert, you surely have a silver franc.

Bless you.

This is the house of God!

Patrasche, no! Come!
You!

You thief! Thief!
Nello.

Little sinner!

If you worried so much about souls
as you do silver...

...there'd be no sinners in this city!

It's all right!

I was going to see Rubens'
greatest painting.

You found my darling dog.

Your dog? I found him by the side
of the road. He was almost dead.

Either way, he is mine.

He doesn't like you.

As long as he obeys me, boy.

Now, one way or another...

...I am taking my animal back.

Understand me, boy?

You understand me?!

Run, Patrasche, run!

You try to run from me?
Stop!

I'll teach you better than that!

This dog is mine!

It's my dog.

You stole him from me!

Now, get away or I'll cut your damn
heart out!

No, Patrasche is mine!
You left him to die!

Let that dog be! Leave him alone!
Get behind me! Get back behind me!

You want trouble, peddler?
You've got it!

Come on!

Are you insane?!

Nello, are you all right?

Look out!

It's over.

It's done.

Nello, come with me.

You're a brave dog, Patrasche.

When can I take my bandage off?

Keep it on for a while.
Keeps the dirt from the cut.

Are you a great artist, sir?

I strive to be, Nello.

But perhaps not.

I think you're great, sir.

I thank you.

But Rubens was the best, though, right?
Rubens was a genius.

Is that greater than great?
Genius is a greatness...

...that burns like an eternal flame.

That's you. I like that one.

You have good taste.

A very gifted student drew that for me.

Did he become great?

She could've been.

But as you know, Nello...

...in our society, no one lets you forget
what station you're from.

Especially for a woman.

She was from a poor family.

She was young.

I was foolish.

I let her get away.

Master La Grande?

I have a friend, Aloise.

She models for me.

Would you like to see her picture?
Of course.

You drew this?
Is it any good?

It's exceptional.

Especially for a boy your age.

Perspective is off here and there,
but that comes with study.

Do you ever give lessons
in exchange for work?

I'd be so honored, but I'm off to Rome.

What about your friend?
Does she give lessons?

She went away. I never saw her again.

But, anyway, you don't need lessons
right now.

The main thing is to keep drawing
from your heart the way you do.

Examine, look at things.

The greater part of drawing comes
before you touch the paper.

Ask questions, find out
what things are made of.

Store information for the inner eye,
the eye of the intuition.

Is that how Rubens did it?
I want to become like him.

That's good. Always reach for the stars.

You could be great, Nello. Why not?

Do you believe you could be great?

Maybe.

Good.

Slow down!

I don't believe this.

Aloise, we talked about you racing
through the fields. There's work to be done.

Nello says when he's a great artist,
I'll never push a cart again.

Down you get.

Most artists would be happy to settle
for enough to eat. Did he tell you that?

Peter Paul Rubens was great and rich.
Nello knows all about him.

Nello can't even read or write.

So I'll teach him, and he'll use me
as his model to paint.

He's such a good artist, Papa.

I don't want Nello filling
your mind with nonsense.

No more riding. You've got work to do.
He'll have to find another model.

Come on.

Your father just wants what's best.
All fathers do.

Why doesn't he like Nello?
He likes Nello.

He just remembers what it was like
when he was poor.

How hard life can be.

Money doesn't make people happy.

Nello and his grandfather,
they're poor and they're happy.

You are so smart.

I don't know who you take after.

Nello will be great. I know he will.

Of course he will.
He has you to believe in him.

Is that you?

Master La Grande.

You're home.

Yes and no. I must return to Rome.

But not for long. The bishop wants
a smaller nose, that's all.

But look at you. I barely recognized you.

Of course, I recognized your friend,
Patrasche.

And your model hasn't changed a bit.
Master Rubens.

But let's see.

Let's see how you are doing.

Your eye has grown clear
and your hand strong.

You've cared wisely for your talent.

Perhaps it's time to graduate to painting.

Painting?

Perhaps it's time.

Good.

This is for you as well.
I was all prepared, you see.

And the brushes.

You'll need many brushes.

Those are all for me?

Tools of the trade for a fellow artist.

Early Christmas present.

I've never seen so many
beautiful things before.

Those pigments are very strong.
Here...

...try one color at a time.

Place it next to other colors...

...mix them, fall in love with the colors.

And then look at nature...

...and your surroundings.

See how these colors are reflected.

How many colors, for instance,
in your blouse?

Let's see. Blue, of course.

There's white.

But it has other colors as well.

But, also, a little green will bring it
to that shade exactly.

Experiment.

Here.

Sometimes at the end of a day
I have 30 colors...

...in my palette, different shades.

Now for a box for you.

What?

The city fathers...

...sponsor a Rubens Junior Art Contest
each Christmas.

You must enter it.

I could never win.

What's that?

Is that my pupil speaking?

How could I?

The first step to winning
is believing you can win.

Of course you can win, Nello.

It's too late for me.

There's plenty of time before Christmas.
You can do it.

I mean it's too late for me
to start my art studies.

Nonsense.

Rubens himself was older than you
when he started.

Really?
Really.

And did I forget to mention...

...that the winner gets 1000 silver francs...

...and a scholarship to art school?

Did you hear that, Patrasche?

One thousand silver francs.

And he's going to win it, Patrasche.
He's going to win it.

Hi, Nello. I made you some cookies.

They're not that good, though.
Mother says I ride better than I cook.

Papa thought the heart-shaped
cookie was for him.

And this one's for Patrasche.

Thanks, but...

...they're too pretty to eat.

I've got something for you too.

It's beautiful.

What is it?
It's what it will be that matters.

<i>I'll call it Portrait of a Princess.</i>

It's beautiful.

I feel so small when I look up at the sky.

Really?

Why are some people born rich,
some poor...

...some healthy...

...some real sick?

It just isn't fair.

I really hadn't thought much about that yet.

Ever since my mother died...

...I've wondered where she went.

Maybe she's one of those real bright
stars that come out every night.

I hope so.

It wouldn't be right if the spirit
of a great man like Rubens...

...and good people like my mother
just didn't go on after they died.

I'm sure you're right, Nello.

God's too smart for that.

I'd better go.
It's time to go, Aloise.

Meet me here tomorrow night,
and I'll finish your sketch.

All right, Nello.

You're going to be a great artist,
just like Rubens.

Listen.

Can you hear it?

Yes.

Music.

It's the circus.

I saw them pass earlier
on the way to the city.

Papa says circus people stuff little
girls in sacks and sell them.

Like grain? That's silly.

They travel and play games
and make people happy.

How could they be bad?

I don't know.

I better get you home first.

Nello Daas, if you're not afraid,
I'm not afraid.

Maybe we should go back.

Are you kidding? This is great.

Come on, Nello.

You will be great one day, little one.

Your life and love will touch many.

Your stars are crossed.

Your hearts beat as one.

You have known each other before.

In this life, you will finally
find true happiness.

Where are you?
Can you hear me?

Answer me!

Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right.

I'm sorry, Papa. I fell asleep.

Master Cogez, it was all my fault.
I wanted to draw her picture.

Do you have any idea how worried
we've been? Any idea at all?

It was my fault.
I'll deal with you later.

You're thoughtless and irresponsible.

Aloise is our life. I won't let you
jeopardize that. Do you understand me?

Millie, take Aloise inside, please.

Nello, would you come here?

That picture you did of Aloise.

The painting is foolish, but it does
look like her, and my wife likes it.

I'll buy it from you.

It's not for sale.

So be it.

Fetch the boy's picture.
Master Cogez.

It's a present.

I want you to stay away from my daughter.

But Aloise is my friend.
You're not welcome here anymore.

Because of last night?

No.

Because it's for the best.

Best for who, sir?

I could've seen the Rubens
with that silver franc.

I couldn't sell her picture.

One day when we're great, Patrasche...

...Aloise's drawing will be worth its
weight in silver.

Don't cry. I'll talk to him.

You're right to be upset with them,
but you've gone too far.

She'll get over it.

Nello's like a brother to her.
Brother? Anna, come on!

You know where this is going.
Lf it did come to pass...

...would that be so terrible?
Nello is a fine, hardworking boy...

He's an orphan.

No girl can do better than to be happy.

Even if it means marrying a tinker's son,
like you were.

I married you for love.
I went against my father's wishes.

And I didn't judge you because you
were poor and had dreams.

I had ambitions.
This boy dreams of being an artist.

What kind of future is that?

I turned your father's simple farm
into a prosperous mill.

Is it so wrong for a father
to want more for his daughter?

But this mill will provide for Aloise, always.

You forget.
I know what it's like to be poor.

It's Aloise's birthday soon.

I made her something.

I'm not going this year.

Master Cogez is a strong man...

...but you know there is good there.

He just wants the best for Aloise.

Master Cogez thinks that money
is all that's important.

Poor, my boy.

Being poor is hard on you.

We've lots. We've Patrasche and each other.

I don't care what he thinks.

A little more food would not be
disagreeable, though, would it?

One day we will all be with God
and realize this was just a dream.

Just one big dream.

Sometimes good, sometimes bad.

Will we really all be together again
after we die?

Of course!

Our real home is with God.

And he will not be happy
until we all come back to him.

Then I will see Mother again?

But remember:

She's here now.

Always with you, even though
you can't see her.

Here she is, the birthday girl.

Thank you for the lovely gift for Aloise.

And so then I threw the old fool out...

...and then I bought her house for nothing.

Sir?
Thank you, Millie.

Thank you.

You look very beautiful tonight, Millie.

Olga, thank you very much for coming.

Sweetheart, you go on ahead.
I have business to discuss with Nicholas.

Business tonight?
Discuss something tonight?

I won't have my wits about me.
Not after this much ale.

Exactly, my friend! Exactly.

Because you are too sly for me
when you are sober.

You've had enough.

I know when I have had enough.

Don't you ever tell me how to do
my business, woman!

Now you go on home.

Happy birthday, Aloise.

How pretty. I love it.

It's hard not seeing you anymore.
I know. For me too.

After the art contest,
everything will be different.

I pray every night for God to let you win.

Then I can't lose, Aloise.

Fire!

Fire!

Oh, dear God!

Oh, dear God!

The house and the barn could go next!

Everybody get in a line!

Get to the stream! Get the buckets!

Millie, get the buckets! Get the buckets!

Help!
I'm trying!

Grandfather!

What are you doing?

These old bones can still help a neighbor.

Someone!

Someone!

I'm going to lose everything!
Someone!

Stephens! Get on the pump!

More!

More!

Water?
Yes.

Thank you, William.

I owe you, William. Without your help,
we'd have lost the barn too.

Are you all right, Grandfather?

A little winded.

Don't you find it mysterious?

I looked. I found no broken lantern.

How could fresh, stored grain
burst into flames all by itself?

You mean someone started the fire
deliberately?

Does anybody have any idea who may have
visited here after Aloise's party?

You always see the worst in things.
Accidents happen.

This was no accident.

Come here, boy.

Come here!

You were looking for revenge,
weren't you, boy?

For Master Cogez not allowing you
to see Aloise.

Was Nello here last night?

What are you holding?

Where did you get that?

Where did she get that?

Did you see my daughter last night?

I don't believe this.
Are you responsible for this fire?

Do you really think that Nello
could do such a thing?

People will go to any lengths for
revenge.

I was in bed when the fire started!

You started the fire.
Nello could never have done such a thing.

Wait a minute, Anna. Stephens is right.

The boy started the fire
because he was angry with me.

I did not!
You're a liar!

On what grounds do you attack my grandson?

A birthday present?

I brought the puppet, but that was all.

Proof! There you have it! There is your proof.

But I didn't do it! I didn't start that fire!

Please believe me!

No one will do business with me.

I know, lad.

Stephens' man was already here.
He's taken over your milk run.

So that's who's been doing my deliveries.

I have some chairs. You and Patrasche
can deliver them for me.

I'll give you money. Let's get rid of
your cans. You can leave them here.

Why don't you ask Stephens' helper?

Well...

...since I decided to quit drinking milk
this morning...

...Stephens and I aren't on speaking terms.

Of course, we were never very close.

Come on.

Rosa!

After your mother died, a part of your
grandfather died too.

And some of me.

Your mother was a very special person.

What was she like?

Always smiling.

A hard life. Devil knows what she had to
smile about, but...

...oh, she could light up a room.

I wish I could have known her.

If you know yourself, you know her.

When I win the art contest...

...everybody will know Nello Daas...

...son of Mary...

...grandson of Jehan.

Everyone.
Everyone.

Grandpa left this to me.

It's from your mother.

"Dearest Father:

How long I've wanted to write you
but could not find the words.

I had to leave. "

<i>I hope you'll understand.</i>

<i>I did not want to hurt you or cause
anyone disgrace.</i>

<i>God has his reasons...</i>

<i>...of that I am sure.</i>

<i>The birth of my son was the most joyful
day of my life.</i>

<i>It proves to me that real happiness
comes not from our possessions...</i>

<i>...or our positions, but from within.</i>

<i>Father, I so look forward to sitting
with you again by the water...</i>

<i>...watching the boats pass, with your
beautiful grandson on your lap.</i>

<i>I heard Anna had a daughter named Aloise.</i>

<i>Please give them my love.</i>

"Did Nicholas Cogez start building
his windmill?

Well, for now I must go.

Give everyone my very best wishes
for a happy, healthy Christmas.

Love always, your daughter, Mary.

P.S. His name is Nello. "

Why not come back to the shop
and have a bite?

You could stay the night.

I could use the company.

Thank you...

...but I've something very important to do.

Please, sir! Here's my painting
for the Rubens Art Contest.

I'm sorry, the deadline passed
three minutes ago.

No, but I must win.

Perhaps next year.

I have to win this year! It's my only hope.

I'm sorry. I'm late and my family is waiting.

Please, sir.

This is...

...very good.

This is...

...really good.

I'll take it.

Thank you, sir.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

Good luck.

You're late again on the rent, boy.

How many times have I warned you?
I still have to pay off Grandfather's funeral.

I am not interested in your troubles.

You will have to leave.

As for this month's, I'll settle for the dog.

No! He's my best friend.

You can't afford to feed yourself.

When I win, we'll have
all the money we need.

You are a dreamer. Just like your mother.
My mother was a great woman.

Keep the dog. I'll take this.

And you leave me every miserable scrap
that you own.

I want you out of here by the morning.

But I've no place to go, sir.
You are not my responsibility!

Don't blame me for your miserable life, boy.
Blame your mother.

Out of here by the morning.

Why not wait until after Christmas
to rebuild?

Because with what we lost in the fire,
I have to work the mill twice as much.

Besides, I have nowhere to store the grain.

I should never have let you borrow on
the farm to build that damn windmill.

Really? Well, you like your city-bought
party dresses well enough.

I liked our simple life.

I liked the man I married.

You've become just like Stephens,
driven by the money instead of your heart.

My duty is to provide for my family.

It takes more than money to provide
for your family, Nicholas.

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

Every Christmas, nothing gives me
more pleasure...

Well, let's say, almost nothing...

Than the Peter Paul Rubens
Young People's Art Competition.

For without Rubens, what would our city be?

It would be like a Christmas without...

...roasted pheasant, plum pudding,
fine wine.

Cold ale! Hail ale!

Moving right along, with our
esteemed judges...

...Masters Steerns, Van Wyck...

...and, rejoining our fair city
after a long absence...

...Michel La Grande.

Please, Master La Grande, say a few words
and announce the winner, please.

Mayor Kessler.

Perhaps it's better if Master Steerns speaks.

Nonsense!

"Wisdom before beauty," or whatever.

Go on.

It has been written:

"All nations...

...closely should you treasure
your great men...

...for by them alone
will the future know you. "

In this our city has been wise.

She glorified her greatest son
during his life...

...and magnified his name after his death.

Indeed, what would this city be...

...as the mayor said...

...but a sad bundle of stones
without his art to spark its citizens.

As we who teach art know...

...technique can be acquired...

...but real, true talent...

...is a gift...

...only from God.

This year my vote went to the most
talented boy...

...I've ever come across.

His dynamic painting exhibited vision...

...and a comprehension
way beyond his years.

He means me.

But I am just a single vote, and this boy...

Yes, well, it is getting late...

...and I believe that what Master La Grande
means to say...

...is...

...that the winner...

...is a young artist whose potential
is immense.

Master Robert Kessler.

Good work!

It's over, Patrasche.

It's over.

It's all over.

We've got nowhere to go.

No one wants us anymore.

Come on. It's cold.

What is it, Patrasche? What is it?

It's a wallet.

Look at all this money.

Come in, you poor dears.

Something terrible has happened.

Millie, make up a big bag of food for them.

Is Master Cogez here?

No, he's out looking for the...
This?

Dear God, Nello! You found it.

It was Patrasche.

It's a Christmas miracle! Thank you.
Thank you, Patrasche.

Look. Isn't it wonderful?

We won't need that food. We'll eat together,
and you can give the wallet yourself.

Dinner is almost ready.
Okay.

Come on, Nello. There's butter cookies.

Can you please give Patrasche
some warm milk?

Come on, Patrasche. Come on.

Good boy.

Madame...

...please tell Master Cogez it was Patrasche
who found the money.

He won't deny an old dog a roof
over his head, will he?

Nicholas will be back very soon...

...and you and I will tell him together.

You know what? I have something for you.

Sit by the fire. I'll be back in a moment.

Where did Nello go?
I don't know.

Maybe he went home.

It's Nicholas. He's home.

We're ruined. Everything's gone.
All those years of work.

Listen!
I've looked everywhere...

...and I can't find it.

What is that damn dog doing here?
I want him out.

Here! Here's your money. Take it.

Nello may never amount to much.
But you're lucky he's such an honest boy.

And that "damn dog" found it for you.

And don't worry.
There's not one franc missing.

Sir?

Madam?

You should eat something, Aloise.

There's something I must tell you, sir.

Master Stephens told me that if I told you,
I'd lose my job.

I like the job.

I like your family.

I don't care.

When I think about Nello outside alone...

What are you talking about, Millie?

He didn't do it, sir.

Nello didn't cause the fire.

How would you know?

Because I was there, sir.

It was Master Stephens, sir.

<i>It was an accident,
but he did it all the same.</i>

<i>He was drunk.</i>

He...

He...

He lit up his pipe in the shed.

I'm sorry.

Nicholas, what are you going to do?

I'm going to find Nello.

I've done that boy a terrible wrong, Anna.

Nello, where are you?
Answer me, boy!

Find him!

What are you doing here?

This has been the coldest Christmas ever.

But it hasn't chilled the hearts of our
parishioners. The Lord has been bountiful.

Are you ready, Patrasche?

Oh, Patrasche, not enough light.

I can't see it.

It's even colder in here than it is outside.

Must be the stones.

It isn't long till the sun rises, Patrasche.

Once we see his masterpiece...

...we can join Mother...

...and Grandfather.

The only people who still love us.

Look.

That's it. I'm sure Nello
went to see the Rubens.

Look.

Master Rubens?

So, what do you think?

It's...

It's magnificent.

I quite liked your circus painting too.

You saw my painting?

I've taken a strong interest
in your artistic career, Nello.

But...

...why didn't I win the art contest?

You didn't want to just win, did you?

No. And I can't blame you.

You want to be accepted.

To feel loved.

What you want, all men seek.

In 200 years from now, when people
will admire our paintings...

...you really think anyone will remember
that silly contest?

Will I be a great artist?

People will be inspired by you
for years to come.

I know how you feel.

I left home once...

...went to Italy for eight years.

Then my mother got sick.

By the time I came back here,
she was dead.

My mother's dead too.

You were her hero.

Mary Daas. She's a very fine artist.

You knew my mother?
Of course.

Why do you think I've taken
such a strong interest in you?

Master?
Yes?

If it's all right, Patrasche and I
would like to come with you.

No one cares.

Do you really think you're not loved?

Then you've yet to learn to see
like a true artist:

With your heart.

My son.

My son.

My beautiful son.

"The Lord is my shepherd.

I shall not be in want.

He makes me lie down in green pastures.

He leads me beside quiet waters.

He restores my soul.

He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

I went to find the boy...

...who truly deserved to win the contest...

...but I was too late.

We were all too late, sir.

Are you his mother?

His mother lies there.

And his grandfather lies there.

The boy had no other family.

Where is his father?

Most people believe that Nello's father
lived in another city...

...and that he died after Nello was born.

And what do you believe, madam?

I believe what his mother confided in me.

That she had been in love...

...with a prominent artist from this city.

I want to live my life.

But I don't want to leave you,
Grandfather, or you, Mama.

Sweetheart.

<i>You are loved, my son.</i>

<i>I'll always be here waiting for you.</i>

Nello, we're coming for you!

Oh, no, Papa! Is he dead?

Nello, I thought you were dead.
Aloise!

I saw my own funeral.

All of you were there.

Just like I see you now.

Rubens was with me...

...my mother and Grandfather.

Forgive me, Nello, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me.

I have something.

This was given to me when I was your age.

I knew you'd come.

Just like in my dream.

Did you know you taught my mother
to paint?

Your mother?

Mary Daas, your gifted student.

Mary...

Mary never told us...

...who you were.

She was afraid of the disgrace
that it would bring, and...

...she was afraid that the scandal
would ruin you.

She loved you so much.

My son.

My son.

Father.

Dear God, thank you.
