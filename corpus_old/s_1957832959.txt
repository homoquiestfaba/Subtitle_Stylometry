Good morning
and happy November 1st.

Developing story out of
Rabbit Hash, Ohio today

as authorities are seeking
information regarding

several missing persons,

including a large number
of children that has

left locals panicking.

We have all the coverage
here at WKLB in the morning.

Detective
McKinney to forensics, please.

Detective McKinney
to forensics, please.

Deputy Harper, you're
needed on level one.

Deputy Harper to
level one, please.

I just got off the
phone with their parents.

They're on the way.

Have you got anything
out of 'em yet?

Nothing in a while.

The youngest seems out of it.

Probably still in shock.

We still can't find
those missing kids.

I think we're up
to about 13 now.

What happened to them two?

Well, we picked them up
wandering aimlessly down the road.

The only thing we could
get out of 'em was

some evil lady in a hat
and some Halloween ghouls

took their friends.

What's with the board?

That I don't know about.

But, mmm, probably a
favorite toy or something.

Well, let's get going.

These missing kids aren't
gonna find themselves.

This time of year is the
worst. I hate Halloween.

Right. Trick or treat.

No one believes us.

We have to make sure
what happened to us

never happens again.

How?

By keeping this board out
of someone else's hands.

We closed the portal.

The gateway is sealed.

What if she comes back?

She can't come back.

They can't come back.

Let's keep it that way.

When you're a kid,
Halloween is about dressing up

in costumes, getting candy,

pulling pranks,

and celebrating the spooky.

You think the scary stuff
around you is all for fun

and that nothing can harm you.

The reality is that's not true.

â™ª She's a know better â™ª

â™ª I don't wanna show better â™ª

â™ª Not a go-getter â™ª

â™ª Just another gold getter â™ª

â™ª She's a know better â™ª

â™ª I don't wanna show better â™ª

â™ª She's a go-getter â™ª

â™ª Just another gold getter â™ª

Where you goin'?

Nowhere, Benny.

Absolutely nowhere.

You goin' somewhere?

Yes, unfortunately.

I've been called in to work.

One of the flight
attendants I guess quit,

so I'm gonna need for you
to watch your brothers.

Hard pass.

Miah.

Mom.

Mom, I have no life outside
of babysitting them.

Stokely is 15,
for Christ's sake.

Did you have plans or
something for tonight?

No, I never have plans.

That's not the point.

Then what is the point?

Look, help me out
a little here. Hmm?

I can't skip work.

I need you to understand.

You are now the
man of the house.

I don't want to be
the man of the house.

I just wanna be Miah.

I know it has been hard
since we lost your dad.

We didn't lose.

He ran off to Cancun
with his secretary.

Same thing.

And for all I care, I hope
he gets eaten by a shark.

Well, this blows, so.

Miah, please, please.

Fine. Fine.

Thank you.

Hey.
Are you, uh, leaving?

I am. I've been called in.

I need you to listen
to your brother.

I need you to behave.

Okay.
Please.

Thank you.

Guys, I'm runnin' late.

I love you all.

Love you, too.

Take care of them.

I will.

Bye.
Bye.

Well, what do you wanna do?

Come on, anus.

Yeah? Who is it?

It's Miah. Open up.

What's the password?

Eat shit and die.

Lucky guess.

Cool.

Whoa! What's this, Stokely?

There's boobs?

Yeah, it's a double version
of "Die, Die Babe Masker 4."

Do you have parts
one, two and three?

What do you mean?
Of course I do.

I own the whole series.

And you're not
watching any of them.

What? Why not?

I mean, Mom's gone, and it may
do the little guy some good.

You know?

Because.

No, no.
What? Why not?

Come on. We're
going into town.

We're gonna rent us some
movies or something.

What?

Hopefully with
less crappy acting.

This is good acting.

Nope.

Hey, oh, can we stop by Mabry's?

There's something I
wanna show you guys.

Whatever.
Just hurry up.

Hey.

I'll show you later.
Just don't tell Miah.

Ooh. Hey!

Guess who I saw the other day.

I don't know, Stoke. Who?

It was one Cammy Belanger.

Did you talk to her?

Oh yeah. I talked
to her for hours.

Talked about, let's see, school.

Uh, her bra size.
There it is.

Whether she prefers to wear
underwear or go commando.

And, wait for this one,

your super creepy
infatuation of her.

You're not funny, ass.

Is that the girl whose picture
you're always staring at?

Shut up, Benny!
Dude, it totally is.

I don't see why you haven't
asked her out already.

I don't know. Stoke.

Maybe it's that she's
way outta my league.

Ah.

Maybe it's her
dick of a boyfriend.

Man, screw Billy Masterson.

He's an idiot meat head.

Idiot meat head with
a car and a license.

Star running back that could
pummel us into oblivion.

Man, who cares
what he does to hide

his fragile, little ego.

And plus, you and Cam
have history, bro.

Stokley, the class in the
fourth grade is not history.

End of conversation.

Have it your way.

He's your brother, not mine.

Lookie, lookie.

What have we got here?

Check out the nerd herd.

You might wanna be
careful on these little bikes.

It could be dangerous.

Stop. Let's go.

What? I'm just giving
these diaper stains

some friendly advice.

No, you're not. You're
being a douche bag.

Are you guys okay?

I mean, I'm not.

That piece of trash
almost hit me, man.

What did you just call my car?

You heard me. I called
it a piece of trash.

No, I didn't quite
catch that, shit smear.

I think you know what I said.

That's what I thought.

Enough.

Oh, shit!

Are you about to
do something, Mia?

Muzzle your little bitch
brother before I do.

Okay, Billy. Stop.

Come on.

Fine. Have it your way.

Next time, dick wad.

Come on, sweet tits.

Boop.

See, the best way to
handle Billy, just kick-

Just shut the hell up, Stokely.

I was just gonna say kick
him in the dick, I mean.

Welcome back
to our creature feature film.

Hey, man.

I was just, hey.

Is that weed?

It's medicinal.
Right.

Got a PTSD thing.

I was just gonna show
my two lame brothers

all the cool stuff he got here.

Yeah, man, go ahead.

Just, you know, you
break it, you buy it.

All right.

Now I see why you
like this place so much.

Will you shut up?

God.

There it is.

What is it?

It's right there.

Okay, but what is it?

Somethin' catch your eye, guys?

Oh, no.

I was just showing them
your collection here.

Stokely.

I caught you staring at that
board several times this week.

What did I tell you last time?

It's not for sale.
Right.

Now if you guys are into
the weird macabre shit,

I've got plenty of other
stuff you can check out.

What is this supposed to be?

Those symbols look
Halloween-related or somethin'.

Yeah.

It's, uh, it's called
the board of Zawan.

In ancient times,
you know, Halloween,

Zawan was a time
that the boundaries

between dimensions
was the thinnest

and creatures could cross over

from one dimension to the next,

and that, that's what
they used that for.

You ever hear of
the Narnia Chronicles?

In those it's a
wardrobe that opens.

Narnia, seriously?
What is wrong with you?

Guys, this thing's cursed.

All right, in fact
there's not much in here

that isn't cursed or haunted
or tainted or somethin'.

You ever thought about
seeing what the bad boy can do?

I'm sure you guys have
heard of the 13 kids

that went missing
here 30 years ago.

Well, yeah.

All of them had
contact with that board.

All right?

Screw with that thing,
it never ends well.

Leave it alone.

Okay.

We gotta get that thing.

Nope.
Come on.

Guys, I'm all for
having a good time,

but do we really wanna do this?

Dude, where is your
sense of adventure?

I don't know, Stoke.

Maybe my common sense
is obscuring it.

Aren't you just a bit curious?

Curious of what?

If we can get away
with burglary?

No, what the hell it does.

If it works.

I mean, Mabry said
that thing was tied

to all those disappearances,

and that's like the only
thing this place is known for.

All the more reason
not to mess with it.

Hello.

"Hell raiser," "Evil Dead,"
"Jumanji," "The Ring."

All good movies.

There's obviously a good
reason it's not for sale.

Come on, Miah.

We don't get to do
anything fun anymore.

You guys are gonna get us
into so much shit over this.

So, uh, you in?

I'm not stealin' anything.

I'll keep watch or
whatever, but I refuse-

What are you guys doing?

Hey, Cammy.

You guys look like
you're plotting something

or scheming or whatever.

What are you doing?

No, we, no, we, um.

We're trying to get
something from the store.

So go buy it.

Wow, Paris, you're
like a genius.

If it were only that simple.

See, the thing we're
after, he's not selling.

We're going for a one,
two, five-finger discount.

So what is it?

It's this stupid
spirit port thing.

It's dumb.

Spirit port? Cool.

Gross.

Cool?
Yeah, totally.

I love stuff like that.

You do?

We'll help.
No, we won't.

You, mmm-hmm. Okay.

Um, you don't have to do this.

I was just going through
with it for my brothers.

If we get caught, we're
gonna be in deep shit.

Yeah, it's exactly
why I wanna do it.

And besides, we all have
to live a little, right?

Touche.

Mabry.

Why do you always have your
nose in that witchy book?

It doesn't hurt to be prepared.

Prepared for what?

What are we fighting now?

Werewolves? Vampires?

Wee little leprechauns?

Have you forgotten
what tonight is?

No, I haven't forgotten.

This is how I deal
with things, Mabry,

with my unbridled charm and wit.

And wit.
And wit.

Wit, Maybry, wit.

I'm gonna go back in
the back and repackage

some shrunken heads.

You do that, please.
Get drunk.

You're just upset that I
got the looks in the family.

That's all.

Yeah, crushed over it.

You seriously didn't
have to do this.

It's probably one
of these stupidest-

No. I wanted to.

Plus it gives me a chance
to apologize for earlier.

So why are you?

What?

You know.

I'm just curious what you
see in a guy like Billy.

I mean, it's not like
we're engaged or anything.

I'm technically not
even dating officially.

I mean, Billy's a jerk,
but he can be sweet.

Billy Masterson's sweet?

Yeah. It sounds crazy.

But I mean, it's true.

I mean,

no one else has really
shown any interest.

Right.

I, I don't think we should be

doing this, Stokes.

Dude, put your big boy pants
on and take off your diaper.

What is wrong with you?

Stop it!

Sorry.
Mmm!

Oh my god, Miah! Are you okay?

All right over there, Sanders?

Ah, gee, Mr. King,
we are so sorry.

I guess Miah here wasn't
paying attention to the signs.

Signs? There were signs?

Come on. Let's go.

It's all right.

I'll go get you a
band aid or something.

No!

No.

It's just a scratch!

Right, Miah?

Right, Miah?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

So sorry for the
inconvenience, Mr. King.

Hell and yes, we pulled it off!

Are you sure you're okay?

I mean, they were
about to get caught.

It's the only thing
I could think of.

No harm, no foul, right?

All right, we helped
your little dweeb friends.

Can we go now?
Yeah, just a second.

I'm gonna call Jared.
Have him come get us, okay?

Okay. Do that.

Cammy, are you kidding me?

I'm right behind you.

Damn! Call me later.

Piss off, Stokely.

So now that you have the board,

what do you plan to do with it?

Figure out what
it does, obviously.

Do you wanna come?

It would be wrong not
to include you since you

kind of made this all possible.

Yeah. Hell yeah, I wanna come.

I just gotta catch up to
Paris and calm her down,

but what time and where?

The fork, 9:00pm.

It's right up the
street from our house.

Cool.

Yeah, I'll see you guys there.

Maybe we could hang at
your place afterwards?

Okay. Sure.

Okay. Don't start
to party without me.

Dude, I sense an
ulterior motive here.

There. I restocked
the holy water.

I did not pee in it this time.

I actually got it
from the church.

They tried to make
me pay for it.

So I ran, broke
the glass. Sorry.

Have you seen my book?

Yeah, like every day
for the past 30 years.

Here's a better question.

Did you eat? Did you sleep?

I'm serious, Parker.
It was just here.

You're like this every year.

And you know what? Now
you're upsetting Pickles.

So, you're fine. I'm fine.

Pickles is fine. We're all fine!

Hey, we should get started, bro.

It's getting pretty late.

It's not nine yet.
She still has time.

Okay.

Hey.

Sorry that took me so long.

This is really out here.

Yeah, it is way out.

Yeah, I didn't want
you to think I was

like standing you
up or something.

No, no, no. It's totally fine.

Yeah. Glad you're here.

Let's get started,
eh? Chop, chop.

Bah!

Sorry, I was to
lighten the mood.

What's the hold up, numb nuts?

Will you shut up?

I'm trying to make
sure I do this right.

Doesn't really come with
an instruction manual.

I'm kind of making
it up as I go.

What if we all
put our hands on it?

Like, like a ouija
board, you know?

Worth a shot.

Oh, shit. It glows?

Do you guys feel that?

Wha, what's it doin', Stokes?

How am I supposed know, man?

Oh, here are the words.

Wait!
Someone do something!

Miah! Miah!

Snap out of it!

Miah!

Miah! Miah!

What's happening?

Miah! Miah!

Miah!

Oh, no, no. Is he
dead? Is he dead?

I mean, it looks like it.

Miah?

Are you okay?

Think so.

What just happened?

You good, B?

I'm good. You?

Yeah, I think I'm fine.

You gotta be kiddin' me.

Cool. The board
sends assholes.

Paris told me that
you've been super friendly

to this little sack of shit!

I mean, it's almost
like you're fond of him.

Had to find out for
myself and I come here

see you all cut up in
the woods playin' some

fuckin' board game?

Billy, seriously.
No, no, no.

Stop!

Shh! No!

Don't say anything more
to me, you little slut.

Oh ho! Shit!

Nice hit, little spitfire.

Miah!

I want you to know somethin'.

I really want you to
use your imagination

when I tell you this.

Your hand?

It's most definitely
not the first thing

that she's put her lips on.

Oh!

Come on.

Billy, you asshole!

Whatever, bitch.

Oh, shit.

Do you even know
how to use that thing?

Only one way to find out.

Of course he doesn't.

Now, piss off.

Come on. Let's just go, babe.

You're dead, little boy.

You got brass balls, kid.

Bigger than your brother's.

Benny.

Benny, give me the gun.

Ben.
Benny!

It's all right. Let's go.

What the hell are
those pussies doing, huh?

Fuckin' some ghost or something?

I just can't believe Cammy.

I mean, do you think she's
at his house right now?

Nobody screws me like that
and lives to talk about it.

Just forget 'em, all right?

She chose them and not us.

I wonder what Steve's
doing right now.

He's probably in the
fucking car masturbating

his little dick.

Hey, we're about to go up there.

We're gonna teach these
little pansies a lesson.

What's this twinker doin'?

I don't know.
What is she doin'?

She's standin' there.

Hey, asshole!

I don't have time for this shit!

Billy, over here.

What the fuck is this?

Oh, no.

Slow, slow.

Should we call Mom?

No, Benny, we
shouldn't call Mom.

Use your fucking head.

I'm sorry.

Another stupid idea on a
day full of stupid ideas.

I-

I mean, what were you thinking?

A gun? Seriously?

Where did you find it?

Mom keeps her guns in the
barn so I won't find them.

Yeah, stupid.

Well, I'm sorry
for saving your ass!

You could've killed someone!

Oh, hey, at least we
still got the board.

Enough with the board, Stokely!

Just calm down.
Miah.

No, stop. Just let me.

Miah.

Miah.

I'm so sick of that asshole.

Why won't he just
leave us alone?

It's my fault. None of
this would've happened-

No. No, it's not.

He shouldn't have said any
of that shit about you.

How bad is it?

I'm fine.

Let me see.

Oh, he really did
a number on you.

I feel awful.

I guess I just wanted
to see you again.

Here's Stokely!

Seriously?

Fine. I had to.

How you doin'?

I'm fine.

Miah may have thought
you made a mistake,

but, uh, I think you're
just a regular bad ass.

Yeah, right.

No, seriously.

Balls of steel, little bro.

And here I thought they
hadn't even dropped yet.

Shut up.

Hey, want some
Nancy Summer shit?

You gonna make me cover my eyes?

Nah, I think you
deserve somethin'.

Come on.

So, uh, board thing
was kinda cool, right?

Yeah.

All right, got the chains.

I'm gonna pick up some grub.

What do ya want?

Why don't you swing by Brady's

and get us some Jungle Juice?

I like where your head is at.

Nothin' I like more on
this holiday than I hate

other than to be drunk.

Oh!

You picked the wrong
fight, Pinocchio!

You all right there, buddy?

I'm drunk.

Yeah, you are.

No better place than here.

On this dirty side of the road?

You love it when I play dirty.

I don't know. It's creepy.

And it's Halloween.

Come on, babe.

I wanna stab you
with my pitchfork.

Come on.

What did you break?

Oh, shit.

The board.

Dammit!

You are so beautiful.

Sorry, sorry.

It's really late.

Yeah, I really
hope it's not my mom.

Shit!

Oh my god.

Whoa.

What the hell?

No fucking clue.

Look, look. Yeah!

Thanks.

So, what do you wanna do?

Haven't shown you my room yet.

No, you haven't.

I got a pretty big bed.

Well, that's good, I suppose.

What the hell is that?

Miah.

Hello?

Hello?

All right, whoever's out
here, could you please not be?

That'd be great.

I'm callin' the cops!

Guys, what's goin' on?

Jesus.

Billy and his goons are back.

Great.

Is anyone else's phone
connected to the WiFi?

Mine says disconnected.

Mine, too.

There's no service this
far out without WiFi.

Jesus, I'm so
fucking sick of that.

Shit, shit, shit, shit.

Billy? I'll handle this.

I don't think
that's a good idea.

I'm not afraid of them.

All right, fine.
I'll go with you.

No, you're in
absolutely no shape to.

Just stay here
with your brothers.

No, I'm fine!

Miah, I'm serious.

What if they hurt you?

He's not gonna hurt me.

Wait.

It's dangerous to
go alone. Take this.

Don't worry. I got this.

Seriously, guys?

All right, Billy.

You've had your fun.

Now grow the hell
up and go home.

Hey, hey.

Did you seal the deal?

What do you mean, Stokely?

Did you seal the deal?

No, we just made out.

Do you feel like you
would've sealed the deal-

All right, will
you shut up, please?

I'm just saying.

I mean, seriously!

I don't know what your issue is.

You beat up Miah.

You go get these costumes
and come back here?

For what?

And Paris.

I guess I expected
more of you having been

my friend forever, but I
guess you're just as bad

as these two lowlifes.

I wonder what
she's saying to them.

Who knows?

That was super hot though
how she stormed outside

with the bat.

I'm getting serious Sarah
Connor vibes from her.

Who's Sarah Connor?

Dude!

I mean, come on, you guys.

You can cut the shit and
take the stupid masks off.

No, dear.

It's anything but pointless.

You have something of mine.

I'm here to collect.

You're not...

Paris?

Oh.

Oh, I see you two
know each other.

Cammy.

Shit!

Help! Help me!

Please! Please!

God, I'm bleeding!

What did I do to him!

Please! No! Please!

I can't! What the fuck?

Hey, Cammy, Cammy, Cammy.

So tragic.

Miah! Miah!

Come on, we gotta go.

Let's go!

Gentlemen!

You summoned us.

Here we are.

Holy shit, holy shit,
holy fucking shit!

We're so fucking dead!

I don't see them!

Shit.
Where'd they go?

C-Cammy?

Miah.

Miah, what are we gonna do?

He's cracked, Stokes.

Miah, did you lock the back
door when you came back in?

Shit!

Fuck.

Not cool!

No! Stop it!

This isn't happening.

This isn't fucking happening.

They killed her.

Was it Billy?

Dammit, Miah, was it Billy?

No, no, no.

Billy, Billy was dead.

What?

So this isn't Billy
and his goons?

No.

It's the board.

Enough with the board.

No, he's right.

I can't explain it, but
something happened tonight,

Miah, and you know it.

Can we please focus
on getting out of here?

How are we supposed
to do that, Einstein?

What about our bikes?

We'll never make
it on our bikes.

But Cammy drove here.

Her car's parked out back.

If we can make it to her car,

we can get the hell out of here.

What about her keys?

Do we just leave her body?

You're gonna pack
the car, Benny?

'Cause I'm not.

We can't.

Our only problem is
gonna be making sure

we get out of here
without running into them.

I only saw three.

Could there be more?

You're forgetting about
the one not in the mask.

So, four.

But how do we know there's
not more out there?

And who's the
creepy Elvira chick?

No idea, but we can't
stay and find out. Come on.

We're so screwed.

Shut up.

Come on, come on.

Pull the trigger, Miah.

Now would be a good
time to kill that.

Like now.

Should've done it
like 10 seconds ago,

but you've still
got redemption time.

Stop it for one
second in your life.

Shut up.
Shoot it.

Okay, we're out of the barn.

No!

You do it.

Back off, slip knot.

Should've stayed down, clown.

You, you have no idea
what you've done!

Get your asses up and
back in that house now

before another one of
those things shows up.

Come on!

Nice shot.

I am to please.

Can we quit clownin' around now?

Clownin', right,
'cause it's a clown.

We got a ghoulie at 12 o'clock.

Like my 12 or your 12?

'Cause this is my
12. That's your 12.

Who cares? He's right there.

Yeah, okay.

You know what? You get that one.

I'll get the next one.

I'm gonna get the next one.

It's like last time, right?

Yeah, I was, I was seven.

Yeah, unfortunately,
like the last time.

Okay, move, move.
Get set.

Move, move!

Look, Mabry, I can explain.

I don't want any of this-

What the hell?

Sit down, good hair.

You three have
royally screwed up.

You don't know what you're
dealing with out there.

Okay, what are we dealing with?

There's a reason that
this board wasn't for sale!

The board?

Yes, the board.
It works like a key.

A gateway to the
other dimensions.

Those things out
there, you summoned.

Wait. Things?

I mean, not like humans.

More like demons
or tortured souls

connected to the board.

He calls 'em ghoulies.

Like the movie?

Yes?

Well, what about the creepy,
semi-attractive lady killer

with the rack?

Samael.

A dark necromancer.

She feeds on innocence.

Oh.

How exactly do the off-brand
Winchesters know all this?

Because when we
were young and stupid,

we used the board.

And those things came for us,

and they took our friends
and they almost got us, too,

but I managed to close the gate.

But it screwed us up for life.

Especially Parker.

That much is obvious.

Oh, you're a little
twat, aren't ya?

Eh.

I'm gonna shoot 'em.

I'm gonna, right in the foot.

What I was able to
learn, and it's not much,

is they can only be
summoned on Halloween.

And they use that to hide
what they really are.

For what?

Do you listen to
nothing that I say?

Halloween. It's the
one time of year

that the veil between the
dimensions is the thinnest.

You screw with the darkness
and it tends to screw back,

without a happy ending.

Now.

One of those things attacked
me at my shop earlier,

so we don't know how many
of those are out there.

But as long as the gate is open,

they're gonna keep
coming through.

It's gonna keep getting worse.

So how do we close it?

It's more like how
do you three close it,

or whichever one of you
recited the incantation.

I don't like the sound of that.

Here's the thing about fear.

It seasons the meat.

From all the way out
here I can smell it

pulsing through your veins,

and I can't wait to feast

on your putrid, innocent flesh.

Especially you!

â™ª Benny boy, Benny boy â™ª

How does she know my name?

Jeremiah!

What say you and I
make a deal, a bargain.

Quid pro quo, tit for tat.

You give me your brother

and I'll let you live.

Humans.

They always do
everything the hard way.

My friends, the stage is yours.

Oh, no, no, no.
This is not good.

What are we gonna do?

We gotta go.

Basement.

Get your asses downstairs now!

Goodbye!

I'm out of here!

Gotta get out of here.

Is there a way out?

Hey, snap out of it.

Is there a way out of here?

Yeah, go this way. Come on.

Go.

Get the next one.

Oh now! What and
call me a biscuit.

If it isn't the
little King boys.

You're grown up, I see.

Hi, boys.

Samael.

You haven't changed at all.

Still a soul-suckin',
Hot Topic, Stevie Nicks

out of hell's trailer park.

Would love to stay and catch up,

but we've got shit to do, so.

Get in. And you watch my seats!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Old friends,
all those years ago.

Hey, why does this always
happen in this situation?

Always?

She's been through
a lot, smart mouth.

Give her a break.

Dude, those things are
gonna give us a break, okay?

Hey, let's go. We need
to leave, dude, now.

Okay, baby, just now start.

Now is a great time.

Start the car, start the car.

Yeah, hey, we need to go.

Whoa! Oh!

Mabry.
I'm trying!

Shit! Come on!

He's right there.

Come on, come on! Dammit!

Hit the gas and run her over!

Now!

We'll stall 'em.

Tell me you're not
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'.

Go, go, go!

Run. Run!

All right, one of you
maggots do something to my car.

This is gonna be so much fun.

Not as much fun
as sending you back

into your little hellhole.

Mabry, Mabry, Mabry.

You have always had a such
a limited imagination.

How?

It's a kiddie pool.

It's a baby step to
where we're from.

Now, I congratulate you. I do.

All those years ago, you won.

You shut the door.

Yeah, I did.

That's not happening tonight.

I will have those kids.

I'm so sorry you won't
be alive to see it.

Maybe not.

But.

Follow the idiots.

Julian Jitters.

The kids have opened the
book, but they got away.

Every moment they
live we are at risk.

Don't let history repeat itself.

Okay, so now that the
dude came to save us,

he's probably worm food.

We need to find some help.

What about Mom?

Hey, this is Ellie Sanders.

I'm sorry I'm over the
Atlantic right now.

I can't take your call-

The sheriff's station.

It's about 15-20 minutes
that way, if we're lucky.

Guys.

All right.

I don't want to be a
negative Nancy or anything,

but we kind of suck
at rescue missions.

We kick ass at rescue missions.

We suck at babysitting.

Fine. Game plan?

We find the Three
Stooges and close the gate.

Right now I need
something sweet.

My sugar's crashin'.

Excellent. I am parched.

Please go inside.

Exactly, exactly what happened.

Trick or treat, boys.

Can we help you?

I need 20 in gas and, um.

Hello, everyone.

This is Channel 7 news,
where the news matters.

You feel all right, fellas?

You're lookin' a little
green around the gills.

You guys seen three
teenagers come in here?

Lanky, long-haired
chick-lookin' dudes.

Real mouthy.

Besides, the teenagers
hang here all night.

Amateur night.

It's good to see the kids
enjoying this time of year.

You know, things
were a little sketchy

there for awhile with
that trunk or treating.

Kids walking around the
gym pickin' out candy

instead of trick or treating.

Stupid shit.

Stupid shit.

Breaks my heart
driving down the street.

No children out.

Bunch of fuckin'
uptight assholes

sayin' it's not safe for
the kids to be out anymore.

She's definitely got a point.

Hey.
Sorry.

What?

What, no, I'm just
saying every Halloween,

trick or treat, monster
mash, all that stuff.

Can we go now, please?

Hey, thought you
looked familiar.

You own that oddity
shop in town, don't ya?

Yeah, that's me.

Got any of them back scratchers
made from alligator claws?

Always wanted one of those.

No.

You two come with someone?

You have a gun
back there, old man?

Gun?

What on earth for?

'Cause you're gonna need it.

Need it for what?

You'll see.

Come on.

Stay here, Janie.

Let me go out an see what's.

What are we doin'?

Oh, probably nothin', huh?

Stay sharp, all right?

What in the hell
is goin' on here?

Oh!

You wanna? I'll go. Yup.

Whah-ha!

Okay.

We're good? We're
good. That's good.

You're fine? You okay?

Y'all find everything?
Ah!

You shot Greg!

Shit.

Janie!

Sorry, Greg.

What are you?

What are you, fuckle head?

Huh? What are you?

I've killed bigger rats
in Brooklyn than you.

I buried three husbands,
you think I'm afr...

Fuck you and your mother!

Ah!

Janie.

Ah!

Ah!

I had him.

Dude, I gotta take
a break for a second.

Call our mother or somethin'.

My lungs feel like
I got Covid again.

We are so dead, so dead.

All right, let's take a break.

Try to get on the platform.

If you see anyone, yell.

Miah, you heard Mabry.

You're the only one who
can close that gate.

Can't close the gate,
Stokely, without the board.

Mabry had it in his bag and he-

Yeah, why didn't
you grab it, man?

Seriously?

None of this shit would've
happened had you not

stolen the board
in the first place.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

I'm not the one who went
all Hogwarts spell casting

and opened the
gate to hell world.

You're such a fucking skeez!

Really, Miah?

Oh, you're gonna get all...

Miah, hit it!

Shit. It's locked.

What are we gonna do?

Let's go around
the back, come on.

Hey, officers, officers.

We need your help.

These, uh, these
things are after us.

All right, all right,
is this some sort of prank

or something, 'cause we've
had enough of that tonight.

No, no, this is
definitely not a prank.

People have been
killed, mutilated.

We really need your help.

All right, all right, all right.

Let's just calm down, okay?

What do these guys look like?

They're not people.

They're wearing
masks. Costumes.

And so is everybody
else tonight.

Like, we just can't
go around arresting

and talking to everybody
wearing a mask.

You know it's Halloween, right?

Okay, look.

Why don't you guys
just go on in.

We'll get a statement and
we'll get this written down.

A fucking statement?

Yes.

Oh, shit. It's too late.

Come on, come on, come on.

Calm down now.

Hey.
Whoa-ho-ho.

We said stop right there.

All right?

I wouldn't, I swear to
God I wouldn't do that.

Come on, let's get some help.

Ah, why didn't I get an invite?

Hey, hey.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

This just will not do.

Everyone is supposed
to be in costume.

Wait, don't tell me.

Oh my god, Stefan
just walked in.

Is he looking? Is he looking?

Don't look! Don't
look! Is he looking?

Is he looking?

'Cause he so wants
to get with this.

Oh my god, Stefan!

It's Stefan. I gotta go.

TTFN. Ta ta for now.

What the hell was that?

No idea.

You look like a good time.

You smell like booze
and bad decisions.

Maybe a tad.

So what do you say?

You wanna unwrap that Clark Bar

and put it in my candy bowl?

Oh.

Nope. Can't say I do.

I just threw up a little
in my mouth.

Best party ever.

Shit!

We're trapped.

Dammit! Can't catch a break!

Oh, before we
die, can I just say

I don't wanna die a virgin?

Chill out, Stokely.
No one's dying.

Benny, stick behind us.
Okay.

For Narnia!

Oh, shit!

Miah!

Batter up.

Holy shit!

I give it a two out of four.

What the hell
are you talkin' about?

I cut his head clean off!

I mean, the one-liner
needed a little bit of work.

Like, welcome to
my world, bitch.

Like "Freddy Vs.
Jason." You know?

Miah!

Stokely!

Oh.

Shh. Shh.

This one, uh, this
one looks tasty.

Benny.

Take me.

Benny.

Happy Halloween.

No, no, no! Miah!

Please!

Miah. Miah! Miah!

Miah. Hey, hey!

Where's Benny?

They took him. They took him.

Let's go get him.

You two look like shit.

Get in the car.

We thought you
were already dead.

So did we.

I have to get to Benny.

And close the gate.

Okay, sure. But first Ben.

I hate to level it
with you, Sanders,

but you need to accept
the fact that your brother

is probably already gone.

Don't say that.

Like there was
already a good chance

you were already dead, too.

That's different.
How?

Because I'm kind of
a badass, all right?

This whole monster
hunting thing?

It's sort of my jam, okay?

Now I hate to piss
in your Cheerios,

but the truth is, there's
a very real chance

that your brother is gone,
just like our friends.

What are you saying?

I'm saying that there
is a chance that your-

Okay, well don't say it.

Stop fucking say that!

You wanna get
pushy with me, kid?

I am not in the
mood to take your-

Screw you, Mabry!

You listen to me, kid!

Whose fault is this, huh?

Who opened the gate?

You! You did!

All right, I am out here
trying to save your skinny ass.

You've got spunk,
I'll give you that,

but you're gonna need it
'cause those things out there,

they're gonna chew you
up and spit you out

if you're not prepared!

Okay.

I'm sorry, kid.

I really am.

This is the price we pay
for messin' with that board.

You opened Pandora's box.

You thought you were just
gonna walk away free.

There's still time.

Wait.

You and your brother
managed to escape, so.

Yeah. Barely.

We barely got out of the
pit before lady death

pulled me down into the abyss,
but he closed the portal.

Yeah, but she didn't.

He saved you.

He did.

So that means
we can still save Ben.

Maybe, maybe not.

Either way, that portal
has to be closed.

Mabry, we can still save him.

I made a promise to protect
my brothers, and I didn't.

I fucking failed.

I will help you end this,
but Benny is my top priority.

Please help me save him!

We don't have much time.

All right, we've killed
a lot of those things,

but as long as the gate's open.

That's too much, princess.

Too much.

Thought it was cute.

Well, can't go into
battle empty-handed.

Great. All right.

So where did you happy
mills mess with the board?

Indian Fork Park.

Let's end this.

Hell, yeah!

I'm gonna shoot that one.

You look terrified.

You should be.

What do you plan to do with me?

Oh, just drain
you of your essence,

indulge ourselves
on your innocence.

Lady, in English.

We're going to eat you.

It's gonna hurt.

This night never would've
happened if you hadn't come.

Yo, Elvira!

Fancy meeting you here, eh?

Did you really think you
can save your little brother?

You know, today has probably
been the worst Halloween

of my life.

First, I make the grave
mistake of messing

with that board,
which causes all this.

And now I had to kill them.

And now I smell like roadkill.

And now I gotta kick
you in your lady parts,

get a Xanax, and
definitely a therapist.

Little boy.
Little?

Please. Nothing on me is little.

My pirate name is Long
Dong Silver, bitch.

Kill the noisy one.

Please.

Do you do everything
Hagzilla tells you to?

She probably keeps your balls
in a jar on her nightstand.

Guys. Guys. What's
the safe word?

Demons cannot own us.

All who oppose
me die by my hand.

Keep sweet talkin' me, lady.

Only I get to kill that one.

Welcome to my world, witch.

I get to go kill your brother.

Oh, shit. Holy shit! Oh, shit!

No!

Mabry.

No!

No!

Oh, no.

Benny?

No!

Ah, no! You little! Ah!

Mabry, Mabry, she's in!

How do I close it?

The passage.

Recite the passage three times.

Miah!

Mabry! We gotta open it.

Open the gate!

We gotta get him back!

Please.

I'm sorry, kid.

Mabry, open the fucking gate!

We can't.

If we open the gate back
up, they come back through,

and it all starts over again.

I'm sorry, kid.

I am so sorry.

Please.

I'll fix this, Miah.

When you're a kid,
Halloween is about dressing up

in costumes, getting candy,

pulling pranks,

celebrating the spooky.

You think that the scary
stuff around you is

all for fun and
nothing can harm you.

A year ago we learned
the reality is

that's not true.

Happy Halloween.

Oh, Mother Ferris, not again.
