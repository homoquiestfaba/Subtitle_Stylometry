<i>In his infinite wisdom,
the Lord has summoned Corrine...</i>

<i>to join Him and her loving parents
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</i>

<i>Loving wife of Troy,
loyal friend to all who knew her.</i>

She is now amongst the angels...

sitting at His side.

-Amen.
-Amen.

<i>Your support means so much
in this time of grief and sorrow.</i>

Joyce and Troy invite you to
the house for further reflection...

and a little nosh.

I got rid of the couch.

You are so strong.

Just like at your father's service.
You didn't cry then either.

I was two.

Well, children are keenly
aware of death.

You were my own little
John-John Kennedy.

-What is she doing here?
-Who?

Your aunt.

Troy. Please!
She'll ruin everything.

How do you ruin a funeral?

I wasn't sure whether or not
you were coming.

Of course. I loved that girl.

Just didn't wanna waste
such a beautiful day...

listening to a bunch
of medieval mumbo-jumbo.

Actually, you know,
the service was pretty nice.

Please! The last time you two were
in church was the day you got married.

And you only did that
to appease Morticia.

Hilda.

-What are you doing?
-I'm planting a testimonial.

-It's a cactus.
-They were all out of eternal flames.

Troy, I'm very overwhelmed
right now.

I will see you inside in a minute.
Let me...

When isn't she very overwhelmed?

Come on inside...

when you're finished.

Just remember, Troy:
peace I leave with you.

Let not your heart be troubled.

So said John.

John who?

Bible John.

Right. Yeah. He was cool.

So, how're you doing?

-I'm okay.
-Good.

Good. Good.

So listen, I was thinking.
We should take a trip. Maybe Vegas.

We've been talking
about going since college.

-No, man. I need to work.
-Come on, man. Just for the weekend.

It, it's good to take a trip
after a loss.

So what are you supposed
to do after a win?

So this is dreary.

-Anybody have a good story?
-Story about what?

We're supposed to be celebrating
Corrine, aren't we?

Hello! Everybody, hello?
Hi.

I'd like to say some stuff
about Corrine.

About a year ago,
she came out for a visit and...

I took her out to my clinic
on the reservation.

And there was this
little girl there, Olivia...

who had terrible stomach cramps.

And she was so shy
that I couldn't, you know...

get her to explain to me
really what was going on.

I couldn't get a sense of it.
So Corrine sat with her.

And suddenly
I hear this gigantic burp.

Corrine.

And then she burped again.
And then Olivia burped.

And then they were going back
and forth like a couple of sailors!

And problem solved.

If you've got a belly full of gas,
it's gotta go somewhere, right?

I'll never forget it. I mean...

Corrine was so special.

Excuse me.

I've been trying to for years.

-Troy, you remember the Tollivers?
-Certainly.

-We met at the viewing.
-Barbaric ritual.

I thought she never
looked more lovely.

Of course she did.
I mean, she was alive.

Hilda!
When you are in my house...

you will treat the dead
with proper respect.

You know, I've never met anyone
who was so happy being so miserable.

-Walk me out?
-Yeah.

Just wait a second.

I thought the viewing was nice.

You know, you really should get away
from all this sanctimonious bullshit.

Give yourself some room to breathe.

My desert's beautiful
this time of year.

I'll think about it.

-Can't ask for more than that.
-Nope.

She wanted me to give this to you.

Okay.

Troy.

Troy!

Mr. Hutchinson. Hi.

Well, I was just wondering
how you were feeling.

Thank you, sir.
I'm gonna be okay.

Maybe you would like
to take a few days off.

-You know, too rest.
-No, really, sir. I'm okay.

I actually feel really good just,
you know, being back at work.

There's nothing like good, hard work
to take a man's mind off his troubles.

So, how is the Boyle project
coming along?

Well, sir, yeah.
Very, very well.

Well, it's crunch-time on that one.
We present in a week, so...

Alright.
So where are we going to lunch?

You're going to lunch.
I'm staying here.

Come on, sushi place down the street.
I'll buy the sake.

No, man. I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

You're gonna make me beg,
aren't ya?

Alright, fine.
Look, there's a cute waitress there.

I can't do it by myself.
You know how I get.

Well, I think you're probably
gonna be okay by yourself.

But I got like a week on this thing
and I don't...

-You're not gonna eat for a week?
-Not what I said.

Didn't say I wasn't gonna eat
for a week. I'm not feeling hungry.

Willy, I said no.
Okay? I said no.

I'm gonna...

-Alright, Mexican. There's a cute...
-Can you give me a break on this one?

I'm not hungry, I got work to do.
I don't...

Alright.

I don't eat Mexican...

food.

Fine.

Hey, honey, I'm home.

I hope you're hungry 'cause
I am in the mood to cook.

And no, you can't help.

I'm gonna make that salmon thing
we had at that restaurant...

near the place where
we almost bought the puppy.

You know, I never told you this,
but I...

almost went back the next day
and bought it anyway.

I know they trash the house
and pee on everything...

but it'd be good practice
for when we decide to have...

Why so glum?

We will have none of that
in my house.

Besides, whatever it is,
it's nothing that can't be fixed...

by a long, hot bath
with your favorite wife.

I'll wash your front.

<i>"My love</i>.

<i>Right now you're sleeping</i>
<i>beside me</i>...

<i>in a torturous hospital chair</i>
<i>drooling adorably down your shirt</i>.

<i>Since you insist</i>
<i>on denying the inevitable</i>...

<i>I decided to write this foryou</i>
<i>for after I'm gone</i>.

<i>I hate to say I told you so, but</i>...

<i>First, you need to know</i>
<i>how happy I was with you</i>.

<i>You made me feel safe and loved</i>

<i>And that thing you did with</i>

<i>You were my love at first sight</i>

<i>I know it sounds weird</i>,
<i>but I promised her we'd do it</i>...

<i>a long time ago and we never did</i>.

<i>Besides, you two have a lot more</i>

<i>Corrine."</i>

-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

-No, here.
-Thank you.

Top'er off?

-How was the pot pie?
-It's fine. Thank you.

Could you tell me how far away
Happy Valley is?

About 150 miles.

Somebody die?

Excuse me?

Only time young people go out to Happy
Valley is when somebody's dead.

Nobody died.

Can't get any reception here.
Is there a pay phone?

Sure. Out by the jerky.

Thank you.

Oh, my. My, my, my.

You okay?

Oh, my God!

-Let me get you a doctor...
-No! Just help me.

Oh, my God.

Okay.

What do you want me to do?

What do you want me to do?

-I don't know!
-Okay, okay, okay.

All right, well,
you just breathe, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!
You are really doing this.

You really are doing this.
Okay. Okay.

Look at me.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

That's it.
Okay, give me my hand.

That's it. Oh, my God!

We have a head!

Okay. Okay.
Look at me. Look at me.

Give me a push.
Give me a push.

That's it. Okay.
That's it. One more.

That's it.

Oh, my God!

It's unbelievable!

Oh, my God.

It's a little girl.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
It's a little girl.

Oh, man.

-She's a little girl.
-Is there a problem?

It's a girl.

What do you know about that!

Thank you.
You did so good.

You did good.
Real good.

Son, you gonna let us
get outta here?

That kid's gonna be talking
before I can get her to a doctor.

Bye-bye.

-Who is it?
-Hey, it's me.

-Who's me?
-I'm sorry. It's Troy.

Troy!

Hi, I'm sorry. I tried calling you
a couple of times...

but you don't have a machine, so...

Oh, yeah. Usually if it's important
they call back or they just show up.

-Where's your stuff?
-It's all in the car.

You know, I'll get it later.

You know, I thought
about what you said...

about getting away and everything.

Stop shoveling.
It was Corrine's letter.

Don't worry. I don't take things
as personally as most people.

Did you read the letter?

She wrote it to you.

This is the guest room and...
clean towels in the closet.

My God. You're never gonna guess
what happened to me on the way here.

I might.

Let me sleep on it.
Good night.

Excuse me.

You know where the pool is?

Excuse me.

Do you know where the pool is?

I'm not deaf, son.
I just wasn't paying any attention.

I'm sorry, man, I...

Better to keep your mouth shut
and look stupid...

than open it and remove all doubt.

Okay. I'm supposed to meet
my aunt at the pool.

Who's your aunt?

Hilda Limberlost.

Robert. Walden.
Call me Bobby.

-I'm Troy Harper.
-The nephew.

Yeah. I came out here
to build my aunt a porch.

Corrine come with you?

I met her the last time
she was out here.

Sharp girl. I always wanted
to meet the guy she picked.

She died.

I'm truly sorry to hear that.

Yeah, me too.

I'm sorry.
Where did you say the pool was?

I didn't.

It's up the street to the right.

Yeah, they're doing their
morning water works thing.

Thank you.

Okay, jumping jacks!
Come on, all together!

You can do it.

Okay. Let's do the resistance.
Forward and back.

Do you feel it? Yes.
It gets to the triceps.

Forward and back.

Hey, Hilda, this him?

Hey, everybody.
This is my nephew, Troy.

Hi, Troy!

Hi.

He's so handsome!

Even more than his pictures.

-So what are you doing?
-Water aerobics.

It keeps the muscles toned.

And it's good for the digestion, too.
Come on in.

Norma!

He doesn't wanna get in a pool
with a bunch of old ladies.

How do you know?
Maybe that's his thing.

I don't have a suit.

Skinny dip.
I will if you will.

Norma!

Well, it isn't like it's something
that every one of us hasn't seen.

-Except maybe you.
-Perhaps another time.

We're here every morning.

Hilda, I just came to tell you,
I'm gonna get started on the porch.

What porch?

You don't remember?

My wife promised you
she was gonna build you a porch.

That'll be nice.
Okay, see you later.

Bye.

See you later!

Do you feel resistance?
Doesn't that feel good?

-No.
-Yes, it does.

A little unwieldy?

Supplies for the deck?

Yeah. The porch.

Hang on a second, will you?

Man, hardware stores, huh?

You gonna be okay here?

You know, I remember
when I was a kid.

A hardware store?

I mean, it was this magical place
your dad took you to, you know?

It was kind of like the ballpark.

You'd spend hours and hours
in there...

just learning every tool
on the God's green Earth.

-This you?
-Yeah.

Now you spend hours in there...

just trying to find somebody
who can help you.

And you finally find a live one,
they don't know the difference...

between an Allen wrench
and Allen frickin' Ginsberg.

That would have hurt, dude.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

You wanna grab it in the center.
Use your hip for leverage.

And then just swing, baby.

I don't know if you realize this,
but a porch is a pretty big project.

-I'd be glad to help you out.
-I'm fine.

Oh, well. Suit yourself.

You know, it's a shame, really.

A person's death is more
the survivor's affair than their own.

Well, I got succulents to over-feed.

Hey, Troy!

Just remember:
takes a big man to cry.

And even a bigger one
to laugh at him.

Corrine took one of those
home with her.

Had a hell of a time
getting it in the car.

Yeah. I had a hell of a time
getting it in the house.

-Here.
-Thank you.

So, how're you doing?

Well, I think I'm gonna be finished
digging the footings...

No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

I'm fine.

Fine.

Yeah.

Well, if it ever comes up,
I'm pretty good at listening.

Okay.

I better go get changed.

The girls are coming over
for Bingo tonight.

Relax. You don't have to come.

Looks like the cat
had another busy day.

That's Juvie. Juventus.
For the Roman goddess of youth.

You must have had her a long time.

Don't bury her yet. Put that feline
within ten feet of a lizard...

she'll make you a belt and a handbag
before you can say Christmas.

I didn't know you had a tattoo.

Yeah. I got it a long time ago.
Thought it was cool.

Turns out it was dumb.

Did you see the sunflower
at the front door this morning?

Oh, yeah. I called the shop.
They delivered it by mistake.

Some of the girls are allergic.

Hello, hello!

Troy, meet the poster girls
at Happy Valley.

Tina Kazawa and
Agnes Clearborn Delta Mercer.

Your auntie just likes to hear
herself talk. You call me Lulu.

This is for you.

We signed it.

So when we're big-time models,
you can sell it for a lot of money.

When I moved here...

the broker said this was
a culturally diverse community.

Turns out, Tina and I
are as diverse as it gets.

So they use us in all the brochures.
We are bait.

Hello, everyone!
Sorry we're late.

Where's the boy?

This is Norma Augenot
and Phyllis Watt.

Now, you are Russian
before you go to the bathroom.

You are American
when you come out of the bathroom.

What are you
when you're in the bathroom?

European!

Let me look at you.

You are so handsome!

I'll tell you. If you were just
a few years younger...

we could leave these old farts
and go paint the town!

Norma, this is Happy Valley.
There's nothing to paint.

Phyllis!

Your hearing aids. Fix'em!

Pardon me. Sorry.

Can you believe this?

That sound could kill mice,
but she can't even hear it.

If you wouldn't call attention to it,
no one would even notice.

Then why is everybody's
ears bleeding?

That sound goes off
in the middle of the night.

It scares the pee out of me.

I'm gonna have to start
wearing those adult diapers.

Norma!

I take it that you two live together.

-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

We have to. I can't see worth
a damn. She can't hear.

But together,
we have all the senses covered.

Except maybe common.

Hilda, you could at least
invite another man...

so Troy wouldn't feel
so out-numbered.

-I know one who'd gladly come.
-Troy's not coming with us tonight.

No. I got a big project for work.

But Bingo's fun! And you can win
all sorts of great prizes.

Why, just last week,
Norma won a food dehydrator.

I was going for the dildo.

-Norma!
-Well.

-It was a personal massager.
-According to you.

While he's with us, he doesn't have
to do anything he doesn't wanna do.

Why don't you come to dinner with us
tomorrow night at the Cow House?

Yeah, sure.
That sounds great.

You'll love it! Best Mexican food
south of Vancouver.

And the best music.

I hope you like to dance
as much as your wife did.

-God rest her.
-We took her when she was here.

She made the mistake of dancing
with some old man.

Every old geezer in the joint
had her out on the floor.

It's true. It's true.

-They still talk about it.
-I thought it was funny.

-Bingo anyone?
-Mildred!

Well, what's with that get-up?

Well, I think I haven't
been winning...

because I haven't been taking
the game seriously enough.

These are for you.

I baked homemade this morning,
but they didn't make it.

So, are we going
or should I sit down?

-If I sit, we'll be here awhile.
-Let's go.

I wanna get a good seat.

Troy's going to the Cow House
with us tomorrow night.

Wonderful!

Be sure and save me a rumba.

Oh, Troy.

What makes fifty blue-haired old
ladies all say shit at the same time?

Have the fifty-first say Bingo.

-Are you drinking a lot of water?
-My God!

'Cause you know you can sweat off
like a quart an hour in this heat.

Yeah, I'll be okay. Thank you.

I brought you my screw gun.

Kill yourself trying to do
this whole thing with a hammer.

I'm pretty good with a hammer.

I'm just saying, man, I just don't
wanna see you hurt yourself or nothin'.

Well, I'll be fine. Thanks.

Boy, your aunt must be pretty stoked,
get herself a new deck, huh?

Porch. Yeah. I guess so.

So how's she doing?
I don't see her at all anymore.

-What, she rejoin the Peace Corps?
-She's fine.

Well, good. Good.

-We have to get going soon.
-Where?

The Cow House, remember?

Yeah, do you mind if I take
a rain check on that?

We don't have much rain around here.

Look, I got a whole lot of work
to do tonight.

Yeah, the girls are all excited
to see you.

I understand that.

Well, nobody asked you
to give your word.

I'm just asking you to keep it.

-Hey, Dawn, remember this one?
-I love this one, Don.

-Why don't we sing it for them, baby?
-Let's do it.

<i>When I'm alone</i>

<i>Feels like my darkest day</i>

<i>When you come home</i>

Here, Troy. Try this.

Cactus jelly. It's delicious.

Only if you like eating
Vicks Vapor Rub.

Hot stuff.

Oh, my God.

This should get you started, ladies!

Here we go. Pass'em out.

Who is the handsome gentleman?

My nephew, Troy.

-The husband from Corrine?
-Yeah.

Oh, you are a lucky man.
She is a wonderful lady. Wonderful!

She broke all the old men's hearts
when she was here.

Be careful, Troy.

These ladies can really
put down some margaritas.

I'd like to make a toast.

First, to Troy's porch.
Long may it stand.

And... and to Corrine.

I miss her smile.

I know it hurts now.
And that may never pass.

But one day you'll wake up
and you'll be all right.

I promise.

Thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you!

What a great crowd!
Guys, I gotta tell you something.

Last week my horoscope said,
don't pull all your eggs in one basket.

So I'm in the supermarket.
I'm wheeling twelve shopping carts.

Thank you very much.

Right now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to take this opportunity...

to introduce a very
beautiful young lady...

to come up here
and do a number with us.

She's got a voice like a hundred carat
diamond ring and a soul to match.

Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the lovely and talented...

Miss Lulu Mercer!

You're gonna love this!

Hey, Lulu!

This is an old tune...

dedicated to everyone
who's ever been in love.

<i>in the night</i>

<i>When we're apart</i>

<i>There's a ghost of you</i>

<i>Within my haunted heart</i>

<i>Ghost of you</i>

<i>My lost romance</i>

<i>Lips that laugh</i>

<i>Eyes that dance</i>

<i>Haunted heart</i>

<i>Won't let me hear</i>

<i>Dreams repeat a sweet and lonely</i>

<i>Song to me</i>

<i>Dreams are dust</i>,
<i>it's you who must</i>

<i>Belong to me</i>

<i>And thrill</i>
<i>My haunted heart</i>

<i>Be still</i>

<i>My haunted heart</i>

<i>My haunted heart</i>

Every time you sing that
my insides get all mushy.

It makes me wanna drag one of those
cute busboys down to the woodshed.

Hey, that's Howard Dietz
and Arthur Schwartz, right?

-Wow!
-Yeah.

You know, it used to be on
this jukebox...

back at this old college bar
I used to go to.

-They had the Jo Stafford version.
-She did it best.

I don't know, I would have said that
until about five minutes ago, but you...

-You ever sing professionally?
-No. I messed around a bit.

So. Low down and funky...
seasons the soul...

but bliss is the yeast
that makes it rise.

Go on now
before you make me blush.

You're looking
very natty tonight, Bobby.

But you better be careful.

One of these old vultures
is gonna kidnap you.

-It's okay. I'm packing.
-I bet he is.

Have you met Hilda's nephew, Troy?

I have. Bet you're looking forward
to relaxing on that new porch, huh?

Yeah. I am.

Well. I just wanted to say hey.

Good seeing y'all.

-Hilda.
-Don't start, Lulu.

That there is the nicest man
in Happy Valley.

He used to be a cop.

He fixed my toilet for me
once for free.

He wants to give it to your auntie.

-Norma!
-Well, it's true.

It's not true. If you will just all
mind your own business? Please?

All the time
I've known your auntie...

it's the only thing
she gets all ruffled up about.

I'm not ruffled! I'm not ruffled.
I just don't like the man.

Now, who wants to go dancing?

Are you coming, Troy?

I will wait for the food.

I'll dip ya.

Next time.

Troy. Bobby wanted me
to give you this.

So what happened between
you and that Bobby guy?

Nothing. When he first moved here,
he kept asking me out...

and wouldn't take no for an answer.

So why didn't you go out with him?

He irritates me.
What are you doing?

I am trying to write
some thank you notes.

-Sympathy cards?
-Yeah.

What are you thanking them for?
Putting a card in an envelope?

No, Mom and I thought
it might be nice, you know.

"May it help you to know
your loved one is in a better place...

far away from the turmoil
of the human race.

And someday, far beyond the pain
that fills your troubled heart..."

Oh, God!

-Give me that one.
-I better answer this one for you.

"Dear Bob and Gloria...

thank you so much for your sincere
and heartfelt note.

It really captured
the essence of Corrine...

and helped me put her death
into perspective.

Looking forward to seeing you
at our next funeral."

-You are so unbelievable.
-Does this mean anything to you?

Not necessarily.
That's not the point.

If they're not honest with you,
at least you be honest with yourself.

I am.

Oh, right.
And you're also just fine.

You know, you don't owe anything
to anybody, especially now.

I mean, if someone were to take
the time to write you a real note...

that meant something to you,
then great, fine. Answer away.

But, to me anyway, you know,
life's too short.

It's way too short.

Hey, Troy!
Wanna take a ride in an airplane?

-A what?
-Wings. You know.

And a propeller. Little knobs.
Gauges.

Guy I was gonna
go with had to cancel.

So I paid for the plane.
I figured I'd ask you.

You're a pilot.

No, I just woke up today and I said,
what the heck, I'm gonna fly a plane!

Are you in or not?

But thanks, man,
I gotta finish work, man.

-How far did you get?
-I just finished the footings.

You can't do anything else
'til the cement dries, dude.

Come on!

Come on, man.

Look. I told Corrine I was gonna
take her up. I never got around to it.

What do you say?

Yes.

What the hell did you do
to this thing?

I got tired of getting stuck behind
all the blue-haired ladies...

so I gave it a little... you know.
I had it up to 63 once with a tailwind.

What do you think of our desert, man?

It's kind of desolate.

We're wide-eyed when
contemplating the possibility...

of life on other planets
yet we wear blinders...

for the beauty right in front of us.

Who said that?

Coulter Bradley,
the guy I was gonna fly with today.

I don't know
who said it before him.

Where's Coulter Bradley today?

Man. His wife's heart gave out.

She was playing golf yesterday.
Talk about having a bad round, man.

What is wrong with you people?

You people?

I mean, you and my aunt
and her friends, you know...

you act like when somebody dies
that it doesn't even matter to you!

It's unbelievable!
You act like you don't even care.

"Talk about having a bad round"!

Maybe if you lost somebody close,
you'd show a little more respect.

What's happening?

-What is happening to the plane?
-It's just a stall, man.

It happens sometimes.

-Can you start it again?
-It usually corrects itself.

-What if it doesn't start up by itself?
-The landing can be a little rough.

Let me ask you a question.

How long were you married?

-What are you...?
-How long were you married?

-Two years. Bobby!
-I was married to the same woman...

twenty-three years.

I had a kid with her.
I lost another.

She taught me how to cook and
I helped her get her college degree.

Bobby! Bobby, we gotta
talk about this plane!

And even though
she's not around anymore...

I still respect the hell out of her.

What are you talking about?

I know you're going through
a rough time right now, son.

-My God!
-And you will come out if it.

If you let yourself.

-Oh, my God!
-But do me a favor.

Don't compare scars.
You're not gonna win.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

She didn't die, by the way.

Who didn't die? Who?

Bradley's wife, the golfer.
She's just in the hospital.

You wanna fly this thing
for awhile?

I've never flown anything in my life.

With the possible exception of the
equator, everything starts somewhere.

You just put your hands
on the wheel...

put your feet on the pedals
and just hold her steady, man.

You wanna come in for a beer?

No, I better not.

Man, tell me something.
What happened between you guys?

I mean, was it just'cause
you were bugging her for a date?

-Is that what she said?
-Yeah.

Well, you can't blame
a guy for trying, man.

That's too bad.

Well, thank you.
I take that as a compliment.

Listen, man. I'm sorry too
about what I said to you before.

That was way out of line.

Man begins cutting
his wisdom teeth...

first time he bites off
more than he can chew.

Where do you get all that stuff?

Life, my boy. Life!

Hi.
We've been waiting for you.

Lulu's selling cosmetics.

It's like a Tupperware party,
but for the face.

-She's taking us to the cleaners.
-Oh, don't listen to them.

Everything is very reasonably priced.

I got great products for the men.

Help get rid of those
dark circles under the eyes.

We're going to the Arts Council
meeting. Mildred's on the Board.

They're deciding the first play
of the new season.

They want to do "Duchess of Malfi".

It's a thousand years old
and boring, boring, boring.

We want to do something
more contemporary.

"La Cage aux Folles".

So, how do we look?

Tell us straight.
It's important we look just right.

You look ridiculous.

We'll show those high falutin'
old biddies a thing or two about art.

That's right!

You bet.

The other night when
we were going out to Bingo...

Phyllis ran a red light.

I said, Phyllis,
do you know you ran a red light?

You know what she said?

"Oh, am I driving?"

She, she did!
Hi, sweetie. Yeah.

I want you to come to the reservation
with me tomorrow.

No, I got a lot of work to do
on the porch.

No, that, that can wait.
There's something I wanna show you.

Right. So what happened to me having
to do anything I didn't wanna do?

We leave at 5:30.

In the morning?

You awake?

You should be awake.

It's great.

Before dawn while
the whole world's asleep.

<i>One of the things I love about</i>
<i>the ancient native culture is</i>...

<i>they nevertake anything</i>
<i>in the naturalworld for granted</i>.

<i>Just nothing</i>.

<i>I mean, plants, rocks</i>,
<i>clouds, dusk, sunrise</i>.

<i>Never for granted</i>.

<i>I love that</i>.

This is my favorite spot.

It kinda makes you know...

God hasn't taken his ball
and gone home.

It's funny to hear you
talk about God.

Why is that?

You called it a bunch
of medieval mumbo-jumbo.

No, I love God. It's his groupies
I have trouble with.

-They named it after you!
-Don't sound so surprised.

So how long have you
been doing this?

A little over five years.

I still fly off here and there,
you know, for a few months.

-Hey, Hilda.
-Hi, Dave.

You know, it's pretty much
my steady gig.

-You know, I just had no idea.
-Yeah, it's coming along.

I'd kill for an X-ray machine
and a sterilizer...

and it'd be nice to find a doctor who
could come more than twice a month.

What do you do when
there's no doctor around?

-You're looking at it.
-Yeah?

Yeah, the nearest hospital's
three hours away.

It's a long way to go
for a few stitches.

-You give stitches?
-I've been sewing up people forever.

You were in the Peace Corps
or something, right?

Yeah, most of the others,
Red Cross, UNICEF, you name it.

But you never married.

Yeah, I never found anyone
who could keep up.

What are we doing?

Linda, Troy.

-Oh, my God!
-Good to see you again.

-How is the baby?
-She's great.

Do you guys wanna
come in and see her?

You know, the clinic calls.
I better go.

Okay. Well, come in.

You should have seen the look
on your face when you found me.

You had some pretty interesting
looks on your face, too.

Yeah. I'm sure I did.

I still can't believe this.

What were you doing
out there anyway?

Well, I'd gone to visit my doctor.

And she told me
I had two weeks left to go.

So much for modern medicine.

-You got her?
-Yeah, I got her.

There you go.

Look at that.

Okay, now, this is alcohol.

I always like the way that feels,
don't you? It's so nice and cool.

And now, look.
You've had shots before, right?

And this is a syringe.
And this is what makes you well.

So I need your help. You'll have
to count to three with me, okay?

-Yeah.
-Okay.

One, two, three.

How'bout that?

-You didn't even feel it, did you?
-No.

You're so brave.

Oh, my...!

You can use the front door,
you know.

I had a little run-in with a hammer.

Man oh man. Nothing centers a guy
like a little pain, huh?

-Think I could use that screw gun?
-Yeah, well, there is a small price.

-What price is that?
-Just a little bit of your time.

I just acquired a small modicum
of fine domestic beer.

And, well, I hate to drink alone,
particularly before three.

When you retire, you gotta have
a garden. It's in the handbook.

And, there ain't that much
that grows out here, so...

voilà!

-Kinda big.
-Yeah. That's what I'm going for.

Just for the hell of it, you know.

I did the same thing
when I was a kid with goldfish.

You know, I used to feed'em,
like, five times a day.

I had'em up
to the size of a salmon.

-I had one explode on me.
-A goldfish?

No.

No, not a goldfish.

Anyway, I'm sitting
right here one day.

And I hear this sound, you know.

It's like the sound
of a fat lady in a tube top...

bending over to tie her shoes,
you know.

And just at that moment
I turn and...

I had cactus juice all over me.

But the upside, the upside is
I haven't had a sunburn since.

You were saying?

I went out to the reservation
with Hilda yesterday.

Did you know that they
named the clinic after her?

Really?

Yeah. I mean, they've still got a few
kinks to iron out and everything.

They need an X-ray machine and a
bunch of medical equipment and stuff.

But it's pretty amazing.

So what was it like being a cop?

-Who told you I was a cop?
-Lulu.

Lulu the Lip.

It ain't like it is on television,
I'll tell you that much.

I do miss the donuts though.

How would you like to see the seedy
underbelly of Happy Valley?

I thought we were sitting in it.

Have you ever been in a bar...

where you knew that somewhere
in that bar there was a guy...

that had killed another guy?

What's going on, man?

Hey, Bobby.

What's up, pal?
How're you doing?

Hey, man. I like the earring.
Nice touch.

Hey, old man.
Let's see some I.D.

Get outta here, man!
Guy was gonna card me.

-Excuse me.
-Come on, Troy. Stop messing around.

-Just put your collar down.
-Thank you.

See this guy behind you?

He was a human soap dish
in the showers at Leavenworth.

Seven to ten years.

This guy over here.

Don't look. Don't look.

Don't know what he's doing here.

He drives a moped
and lives with his mom.

I think I got a live one.
Let me do all the talking.

Excuse me. Miss?

-Bobby.
-Hey, miss!

-What are you doing?
-No, no. The one behind you.

Lady! Can you come over here
for a second, sweetheart?

-I wanna ask you something.
-Bobby.

Atta boy. Atta boy.

Well, actually it's more
my friend over here.

He was checking you out.

He thinks you're kinda hot.

Is that right?

Well. I think
he's kinda hot himself.

Okay, that's nice...

Hack, say hello to Troy.
Troy, Hack.

He owns the joint.

Good to know you.

So, how's that old lady of yours?
She throw you out on your ass yet?

Not so far today.

But we're still fighting
like asses and elephants.

Hack here is suffering from
a bad case of love at first sight.

Tell him about it, Hack.

Well, the way I see it,
there's two kinds of love.

There's true love
and love at first sight.

Now, true love's the healthy kind.

That's where you meet somebody,
you get to know'em, fall in love...

and you get married, have kids.
Live happily ever after.

Now, you find that, you're lucky.
Hold onto it for dear life.

Now, love at first sight,
that only happens once in a lifetime.

Maybe twice. But when that happens,
you're screwed, man.

You are sucked into a vortex,
there's no getting out.

And you don't even have
to like the person.

'Cause neither your mind
nor your heart...

nor your Johnson
is in any kind of control.

You'll be in control from a place
you didn't even know you had.

That's me.

-That's him.
-Unfortunately...

love at first site's usually too
top heavy for most mere mortals...

and just crashes and burns.

But if you can manage to find
some sorta equilibrium...

some balance...

then you're there.
Quintessence.

You know,
I just realized something.

You're much deeper than you look.

Well, I gotta go buy my wife
some pantyhose.

Good idea.

Do not let this guy get you into
politics, Troy. He will never shut up!

Everything's on the house tonight,
right, Hack?

For you? No!

My buddy.

He's amazing.

He's just a big windbag.
You big windbag!

Did you ever talk to my wife
about this stuff?

I don't recall.

Listen to this.

It says, "you were my love
at first sight".

You know, I don't remember
her ever talking like that before.

Far out, man.

There's something else
I don't understand.

She said maybe I'd figure out
how to "uncross the stars".

Know what means?

I saw you the other night,
actually...

you were checking out
the stars on your roof.

-One star, actually.
-Which star?

Alright. Don't laugh at me, alright?
It's kinda weird.

But shortly after
my old lady died...

I noticed that every time I looked up,
I saw this one certain star.

And what was weird about it was
it wasn't the brightest...

it wasn't the biggest,
it wasn't distinguished in any way.

It's just that it was always there
in the same spot, even if I did, like...

there it was.

And I finally figured it out.

It was my old lady.

It was Suki. Just kinda hanging
around and keeping her eye on me.

That's really beautiful.

You wanna meet her?
Maybe she knows Corrine.

It'd be nice.

-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

The stars are so many
they seem to overlap.

They always like this?

You gotta learn to see
what's in front of you, boy.

The beginning of wisdom is having
a firm grasp on the obvious.

There she is.

Right there.

I can't tell which one is her.

No, I guess you can't.

How'd you meet her, man?

I was a P.O.W. in Nam.

And I was busted up pretty good.

And she was a nurse
and a spy for the S.V.A.

She saved my life
and then she asked me...

if I could help get her
out of the country.

I mean, they'd have killed her
if I left her there.

We spent three weeks in a swamp,
but we made it.

When we got to Saigon...

well, the only way to get her out
of there was if I married her.

Was it true love
or was it love at first sight?

It was neither, man.
It was just the right thing to do.

But it ended up being true.

Have you ever had
love at first sight?

Man, you ask a lot of questions.

Jesus!

Maybe once.

What happened?

Didn't work out.

So...

anything?

Well, she'll be around.

When you're ready to see her.

I'm ready now.

Yeah.
She'll be the judge of that.

Hey, guys.

What's wrong?

It's Lulu.

When I come to the end of the road,
and the sun has set for me...

I want no rites
in a gloom-filled room.

Why cry for a soul set free?

When you are lonely and
sick of heart, go to the friends...

you know.

And bury your sorrow
in doing good.

Miss me, but let me go.

For heaven's sakes!

As many of you know...

I like to tell a joke
now and then.

And this,
this one was Lulu's favorite.

This old man and this old woman,
they were sitting at a bar...

and looking and eyeing
each other up and down.

And finally the old man,
he shuffles over to her and says...

"You wanna do it?"

The old woman shrugs and says,
"Your place or mine?"

The old man looks at her, says...

"Well, if you're gonna argue
about it, let's forget all about it!"

I know I can't do Lulu
justice to this...

but it was the best thing
she ever gave me.

<i>In the night</i>

<i>Though we're apart</i>

<i>There's a ghost of you</i>

<i>Within my haunted heart</i>

<i>Ghost of you</i>

<i>My lost romance</i>

<i>Lips that laugh</i>
<i>Eyes that dance</i>

I don't know what the hell
I'm doing here.

What am I doing here?
I should be gone like...

It's alright, it's okay.
You're allowed to cry.

-No, I'm not allowed to cry.
-Yes, of course you are.

Not for someone I've known
for four days. I can't do that!

What's that have to do with anything?
If you need to cry, do it. It's okay.

I haven't cried for my wife.

I haven't, I haven't cried for...

It's been almost a month
and I haven't cried for my wife.

What is wrong with me?

It doesn't mean you don't love her. It
means you haven't broken through yet.

You have no idea
what you're talking...

Do you love her?

Do I love her?

I love her more than anything
else in the world.

-Of course I love her!
-Then that's all that matters.

I just, I can't see anything.

Do you know what I mean?
Like I can't see anything...

all I can see is my wife's body and
she's lying on the kitchen floor.

Do you understand how that feels?

Like all day, all day,
every day, that's all I see!

She never spoke to me about this,
about the sickness...

she never talked to me about
headaches, about any of this stuff.

I mean, what kind of a husband
doesn't know his wife is sick?

I shouldn't have taken her
to the hospital...

I shouldn't have taken her.
I shouldn't...

Of course you should have.

-Of course you should.
-I made a mistake.

No, you didn't make a mistake.

No, it's not your fault.

It's not your fault.

Just let it go.

I'm not good.
I'm not a good man.

-Yes, you are.
-I'm not. I'm not a good man.

Yes, you are.

It's okay. It's good.

This is good.

I always spent
too much time at work.

I should have played
more with her.

She worked, too.

Yeah, but, you know, she laughed
so much more than I did.

Well, she's more evolved
than you are.

You know there's something
I still can't figure out.

Why did she have me come out
here to build the porch?

I can't figure that out.

I don't know. She never
mentioned any porch to me.

She set it up. That little...!

Corrine set this whole thing up.

I think that's the first time
I've heard you say her name...

since you've been here.

You know, when I first met her
I thought her name was Karen.

We went out to this party...

her friends thought
I was the biggest idiot.

I kept calling her Karen
all night long.

I thought she was never
gonna wanna see me again.

She turned up at my apartment
the next day.

Next, yeah. I mean,
it was like she already knew.

She just came in, then she started
redecorating everything.

And she hated my couch.

Hey, Troy.

-Hang on a sec.
-What's that?

-Hang on.
-Yeah.

Six and a half.

-Is that your mark?
-Yeah.

Try that on for size, will you?

Thank you.

That's one good-looking deck.
Even if I do say so myself.

It's a porch.

Thanks, man.

Check this out.

I may have a bead
on some medical equipment.

-You sly dog.
-Dude.

Buddy of mine has a buddy who runs
the evidence room at the local P.D.

He confiscated all this stuff
from this Medicare scam.

Says he's gonna
let me have it cheap.

Troy, I want...

Hey! What do you think
of the deck?

Bobby gave me a hand.

Bobby.

Hey, wait. Wait a second!

Bobby. Bobby!

Bobby, wait!

B-1.

B-1.

G-51.

I need to talk with you guys.

You're kidding.

-Wait, everybody. Hey, guys.
-What?

I need to talk
to y'all outside, alright?

Can't it wait a minute? All I need
is I-18 and I win the Thigh Master!

Outside. Right now.

I-18.

-Bingo!
-Shit!

-I need to talk.
-What about?

I need to know what the story
is between Hilda and Bobby.

Come on!

Something's going on. Nobody's
talking to me about it. What is it?

-We have to tell him.
-But we promised.

We never should have.
This has gone on long enough.

They used to be engaged.

They were just kids then.

And he was sent to Vietnam
before they could get married.

When he came back here...

Hilda went to see him
at the V.A. Hospital.

His wife was there.

Right. Because he had to marry
Suki to get her out of Vietnam.

-Did he explain that to Hilda?
-No chance.

She joined the Red Cross
and left the next day.

Even if he had explained,
he was still married.

After Bobby's wife died,
he tracked Hilda down here.

He did everything he could,
but she wouldn't forgive him.

He bought that house up the street
hoping he'd wear her down.

He even leaves her
a sunflower every day.

-That's from Bobby?
-Isn't it so romantic?

He even has a tattoo
of one on his shoulder.

I just can't believe her.
She is such a hypocrite.

No, she's not!

She has a man living down the street
from her who's loved her since...

I mean, since I was born at least.
And she can't even talk to the guy.

Sometimes the hardest person
to give advice to is yourself.

Thank you for that.
Trite and cliché.

I'm getting outta here.

Don't give up on her, Troy.
Please!

Corrine wouldn't want you to.

My wife knew about this?

Sure. She called them
the "Star-Crossed Lovers".

I've got something to show you.
Come on. Hey, girls!

-Hi, Bobby.
-Nice to see you.

-So what is it?
-It's an X-ray machine.

Your buddy's buddy didn't
wanna give it to us at first...

but I gotta say our girls
could be pretty persuasive.

-I hope it gets put to good use.
-Wait a second, Bobby.

I want you to take this out
to the reservation with us.

Come on, Bobby. I know what
happened between you and Hilda.

What's the one thing in the world that
means more to Hilda than anything?

It's her clinic, right?

Let's just forget the head.
Let's go for the heart.

Bobby, I know you love her!

Never argue with an idiot, Bobby.

They'll drag you down to their level.
They'll beat you with experience!

That was pretty good.

Did you like that?
I felt like I mixed up the metaphors.

No, you did, but you more than
made up for it with your delivery.

-Thank you.
-You've got potential, kid.

I mean, you're no Buddy Hackett,
but I'll work with you.

I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

I'm gonna have you writing
fortune cookies before it's all over.

-Just get in the truck.
-Why don't you get in the truck?

You get in the truck.

She was very lucky
she didn't break anything.

I'm gonna give you some
of this gauze. You take it home...

and every time it gets dirty...

probably by the time you
get home, you'll need to redo it.

-And every time it gets wet...
-And don't spoil the surprise.

Keep the surprise.
You're not...

-What's all this?
-We have a surprise for you.

-I'm a little busy.
-No, come on.

Get your butt outta here.
Come on!

Five seconds. Just give us
five seconds. Come on.

-Where? What?
-Straight ahead. Straight.

Right, to the right.

We found an X-ray machine.

There's a blood analyzer
and an instrument sterilizer.

-How on earth did you find this?
-From a friend of ours.

He heard what great work you're
doing out here and wanted to help.

Who is it?

Thank you very much.

You're welcome, Hilda.

That's okay.
Wait a second.

-What are you doing?
-I'm getting the hell outta here.

Look, I know what happened
between you and Bobby.

What do you think you know?
You don't know anything.

You know what it feels like
to spend a year of your life...

not knowing if the person
you love is dead or alive...

or being tortured? Do you?

Do you know what it felt like
to finally find out he's safe...

and go to the hospital room
and there he is with his... wife.

Do you know how that felt with his
engagement ring on my finger? Do you?

She saved his life, alright?
He had to marry her to save hers.

He didn't have to stay with her.

He didn't have
to have a child with her.

Hey, you disappeared. What the hell
was this guy supposed to do?

Look, I told you how I felt about
him when you first got here.

You should have left it alone.

I told you how I felt when I first got
here and you didn't leave that alone.

-That's different.
-Why?

Why is it different?
Why is it different?

You've wasted the first half
of your life because of this stuff.

Do you think it's wise
to waste the rest of it too?

What do you expect me to do?
Just pretend it didn't happen?

I can't believe you, you know?
I can't believe you!

You're such an expert
at giving other people advice.

You're a real idiot when it comes
to yourself, do you know that?

You know, how dare you?

How dare you waste this chance?

Hey, baby.

It's me.

Guess you know that, right?

So, what do you think of the deck?

Porch. This thing, whatever.

We're gonna finish it tomorrow.

Not that that's why you had me
come out here, but...

I did it anyway, so there.

Me and Bobby.

I think you probably
planned that, too.

Sweetheart, I'm sorry I couldn't
figure out how to uncross the stars.

Man, she's so stubborn!

You know, if she could see
what she was missing.

Damn it, I'd give anything in the
world to have a second chance.

But it's not gonna happen.

That's okay.

You know something?

I think I might have
figured out why...

I haven't been able
to find your star yet.

And it's not 'cause you've been
hiding from me, you know.

I've been hiding from you.

I'm not sure, I think maybe I was
just ashamed to admit that...

to admit that I can go on...
That I can go on without you.

<i>It's just</i>...

<i>There's so much</i>
<i>I've gotta do here, baby</i>.

<i>Down here in the world</i>.
<i>And I</i>...

<i>and I'm gonna need you</i>.
<i>I need you</i>.

<i>I love you so much, baby</i>.

You're my love at first sight.

Bobby?

Hey, Bobby!

Hey, man.
Hey.

You sleep in today?
No, I had a really long night.

Listen. I'm really sorry
about what happened yesterday.

-I should have left that alone.
-Man, that's cool.

No, it's not cool. You know what?
You're a great guy...

you deserve a whole lot
better than that.

She... I thought
she was different, man.

I guess it's easier to do as I say
than to do as I do though, right?

You're right.

Come look what this guy's
been wasting his time on.

I told you he was crazy.

Okay, well...

I'm probably not necessary
at this moment in time...

so I think I might just...

Thank you.
