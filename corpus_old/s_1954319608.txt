You need to drown in the well.

Or to bury

Everybody's happy except you.

I wanted to stay longer.
This is

You forget something.

If not for me, this place
would be just a fishing village.

You played a poor friend.

You signed all letters of credit.

I've already inquired.

I do not disparage, Dumont.

If not for me,
would not be sitting at this desk!

Were not you the one
who lost influence and wealth?

I'll break your head!
Stop it!

You do not understand.
No longer has any power.

You are no longer bourgeois.
Already a none.

I'm sorry your dad.

Maxim!

I see a man.
It should not be ignored.

He brings great news.

News? Good or bad?
You'll know when downloading maps.

You want to please me, Astrid?

Tell me something nice.

I look at the cards.
I can not lie.

Monsieur de Bofremon.

For several months looking for Maxim.

And I came across his old father.
I do not know you.

You are?
Perdyugas. At your service.

Your son owes me a large sum,

Now you will fix the bill.
And all will be forgotten.

My son is not a gambler!

Give them a drink
to leave us alone.

He has the beggars.

Do not you dare, Perdyugas.

You know me.

Leave the man alone.

All right.

And you, come quickly behind the bar.

Come on.

Courage you, but I will not leave you.
Get out!

<i>On the way home,</i>

<i>trader struggled with the wind
cold and grief.</i>

<i>imagining him how wander alone in the dark
or even worse,</i>

<i>lying in the dust with his throat cut.</i>

<i>He clutching the reins of his horse,</i>

<i>hurry to go home,
hoping that his son was there.</i>

I can not wear.

Forgive me.

House.

I did it!

But this is not it.

Is anyone there?

I've lost my way.

It was open.

Who's there?

Rave.

Or am I dead
and I am in heaven?

No, apparently I live.

And I'm hungry.

I would like to get something from the table.

Dresses.

Scarves.

Powders.

Incredibly, there is everything.

Well, almost everything.

Who's better?

I see that you do not reach the treasures.
He wanted to steal my dearest.

Do not let me call
thief or coward.

I'm a man of my word and honor.

Who picked this rose?

For my youngest daughter.
I love her more than anything in the world.

Then I will give you one day
to say goodbye to their loved ones.

And remember the words:
"More than anything in the world. "

I'll whisper your horse
and he will bring you here.

I will not return.
Yes, it will come back.

Otherwise it will kill you
all your children. One after another.

And finished first with a small,
because your favorite.

Remember that.

A Life for a rose.

Here it is! That's it!

That story Rose is a strange beast.

Fables.
A gift from where?

No money for them.

"More than anything in the world?"

And as if by magic horse will find his way?
It's all our fault.

But do not ask rose.
It's not anybody's!

Shut up.

I can not tell you who this beast

but because I stole this rose,
Tomorrow should be returned to him.

What will you do?
I do not know Tristan.

Said - a life for a rose.

And if you do not go?
Then you will die.

Everyone.

Do not say anything.
I know what you all think.

Mom died when I was born.
I do not understand what the connection is.

I do not want to die for me!

<i>Bell! Bell!</i>

<i>Bell!</i>

Do not forget me.

<i>Bell!</i>

<i>Bell! Bell!</i>

Bell!
No, Daddy!

Take me to the castle with the beast.

As quickly as possible.

<i>A Life for a rose.</i>

<i>When finally heard shots
clock, Bell was ready to die.</i>

<i>But she found the castle of the Beast</i>

<i>a noise, stronger and more beautiful
by bell,</i>

<i>that is crawling.</i>

<i>It was the rhythm of his heart.</i>

My name is Bell.

I came
to replace his father's life.

Sit down.

Eat.

When you regain strength,

you can walk everywhere.

But when night falls,
I forbid you to go out of the castle.

If I must die, let it be now.

Bolder than his father.

Every night at this hour
should not be here.

Do not even think about running.

Forest will devour.

Should I stop reading?
No, I want to hear the rest.

It is so sad. Itself is nice.
Yeah, she's all alone.

When climbing the ladder
Bell again realized

that throughout his life
will have its own night.

What we did not know

<i>was that her room to the bed
waiting for her "tadomi",</i>

<i>small creatures
inhabitants of the castle,</i>

<i>who were to become
her best friends.</i>

Am I beautiful?
Beautiful, smart, gentle...

Most desirable.
It will appear and your prince.

Then... you'll have to deal with my brother.

Here it came.

I always knew that my true.

And now I'll eat you.

Get your filthy hands!
Yes, my friend, without effort,

no reward.

Will you never leave her?
For years, eludes me.

But I know I will hit my hour.
This will be my biggest trophy.

After you.

Look what I gave him.
Gold, as the skin of a deer.

Come on. My throat was dry.

I need a drink.

He could still come to me.

Wait what?

You smell like a beast.

Love,
I want to ask you something.

Anything?
I want to give up on this deer.

Why?
With days was hunting her.

I feel terribly lonely here without you.

All right.

But I have a condition.

Grant me a son.

<i>Bell left the room,
hoping Beast is not close.</i>

<i>There sights
which attracts her more.</i>

<i>She wanted to open her own
and to examine the limits of his prison.</i>

Princess.

<i>So Bell realized
that many years ago,</i>

<i>and, perhaps,
even centuries ago,</i>

<i>another woman lived, loved...
and died in that damned castle.</i>

"Why are you so sad?"
She asked statue.

"What is your secret?"

Subject to sorrow,
Bell ran to his room,

we wait
for her meeting with the Beast.

Late.

Do you like the new dress?
I do not come to my room.

Do whatever you want.
With me going to happen.

Do not look at me. Eat!

And you do not you eat?
No.

Not in front of you.

Can you talk
or be silent as a child?

You are a child. Daring and naughty.

I love me think
a little fool.

So...
You talk too much.

I'm sure you like
to fill the void.

Whose is this castle?
Everything here is mine.

You sound like all men.
It's pretty annoying.

Do you really frustrating
my love?

What do not you like me?

Why are you silent?

Wait a few weeks
your sentence.

Play with me
like a cat with a mouse.

If you accept to be my,
I will fulfill all your desires.

Think beast like you
can have a woman like me?

Looked! Do not look at me!

I know who I am!

PUSH as you like

But it will be mine!

Eat! Do not look at me!
Doing so makes way!

I will teach him good manners!

What's this?

But that's me!

My hidden portrait.

What a wonderful gift!

I wonder which of you
made this beautiful doll?

Where are you hiding?

Exit will not eat you.

I'll leave you here.
This will always be with me.

Today is a big day.

Our kingdom finally
will get a successor.

And you, madam?

Do you want to make

For starters, you do Kingdom.
Hopefully not like his father.

What do you think?
For the first time we met.

To the river.

You get close to the shore
and pretended to undress.

It seemed to me like you're drowning.

Swim better than you.

What if we go back to our room?

Do not forget your promise.

What?

Golden deer.

<i>woke up
Bell decided to examine the castle.</i>

<i>She was determined to solve
the secret of the Beast.</i>

<i>She was lost in the beautiful corridors</i>

<i>feeling that is always followed.</i>

I apologize for last night.

You're right.
Without you here too deserted.

Do you like my gifts?

Why are you silent?
I miss my family.

Forget them.
They no longer exist.

I wish I was like you
not to think about the past.

But I can not give up.
I have nothing.

Nothing. You are right.

I suggest you deal.

A few hours with my family.
Against what?

A dance.

In return I want to see them.

I will not transgress his word.

And so. Here we go.

Are not you afraid to dance with me?

Do not get distracted.

Do you love me?

We had a deal.
Hold your promise.

For a long time I did not promise
anybody anything.

Walk with clothes prince

You think you.
But it turned violent and lonely beast.

I try to spell,
but disgust me.

Never have me!

Now you know who I am.

Tell me again that they detest.
Tell me!

I'll let you see your family
last time.

Really? Will you allow me?

I'll give you one day.

No more. Dress.

Give me your hand.
Which one?

I do not know. Does not matter. Left.

I'll ring you put it?
Still, at least for a while.

Listen.

You know the power of this water.

In order not to hurt yourself.

If anything happens.
Nothing will happen.

Must be prepared.

Bell, if you do not come back...
I will kill everyone.

No. Die.

I'll come tomorrow. At this time.

Who's there?
Hold on target!

Bell!

Everywhere in disarray.

What do you do with these weapons?
Ask Maxim.

Shut up and go back to his post.
Go back?

For your general you think?
Enough, enough.

There you go again?
Do not defend him.

All day hiding in fear.
Me, I'm scared?

Stop it! Stop it!
What is it?

Just look at what waist.

And we you. Just thinking about you.

She forbade me to go to your room.
What have you done?
