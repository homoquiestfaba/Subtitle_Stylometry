I will present, thank you.

The money is better there too.

That no expenditure
everything is easy.

But whatever you do, do not
tell the old Brutus, who know me.

Something that was annoying
when I was a little rushed.

There was one incident, my working,
an earth remover machine in

the work site.

Some friends of mine ... they were stupid,
and turn the machine.

And leave it in neutral and that was it.

Dropped in front of the site
construction.

Do not let the detained
nobody told me that.

So we finally leave, and
thing was over the construction,

we could not stop it,
we tried everything

Broken wire retention.

There were big sparks.

The machine was, above all, low
the hill and ended up in the water.

Perhaps it was 100 thousand dollars in equipment,
lost 4 or 5 seconds.

But I could not blame.

I went ...

Timetables for trains.

Good night baby

Wake up.

Miss.

Can not sleep here.

Can not sleep here
is not allowed.

Okay.

Well, I'm going.

My car does not prendre.

Back to the street.

We will have to push it.

Well, rises.

It is usually where I go.
Thanks.

Stay there.

Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

It's cool.

Do not bother anyone, right?

And return.

I think we forgot something.

Let go.

I think that something.
Let go.

Miss I have to ask

Sit here please.

What is going Andy?

The customer refused to pay
for some products.

I saw everything.

I saw her from entering the store.

No, sorry.
That is not correct.

What are we talking about here?

Sorry

Lord, had not yet
finished buying.

Walked out the door by accident, without paying for those
cans, that was going to see my dog, who is tied up outside.

Mr Hayden, it is obvious that
is happening here.

Lord ...

the employee has the wrong idea.

Rules are applied
to all equally.

If a person can not afford
Dog food should not have dogs.

Sir, just made a mistake,
and I am very sorry.

This does not happen again.

The food is not the problem.

It is setting an example, right?

I am not from here, sir,
I can not be an example.

We have a lady.

Hi, I'm Andy Muni
Jack's La Tieng.

Sir, my dog is
attached to the front.

Lord my dog tied up outside.
Just relax.

Of the face.

Now your left.

I can give my backpack?

Not yet.

This machine will kill me.

We must do this again ...

$ 50.

Excuse me?

You can pay your deposit now,
or you can return in 2 weeks,

for a trial on the judge, and there will pay
50 dollars, plus court costs.

I do not live here, I'm just passing through.

If the stop in another state,
terminates here.

You can use a credit card.

Cash.

Have not seen a dog?

Excuse me, does anyone have a dog?

Was attached to the front this morning.

Brownish yellow.

How a German shepherd?

Medium-sized

Have you seen my dog?

Not since I saw you.

That opens garage ever?

Almost every day, yes.

Is there a kennel for
here? There should be close.

Not very far.

Are you pretty well?

Yes, you have to go
to the kennel.

That's easy.

Just take the street here in defrente,
until the end of the road.

Then get there, turn to the right,
be a 3 miles.

Did you miss your dog, right?

If.

That seems.

My heart
¿Near here?

TRAVEL TIMES OF THE BALSADERO

FISHERY NOROESTE

Good morning.

Good.

Arrive early.

Want some coffee?

I think the first is finished.

From Indiana.

You're far from home.

And I have a long journey, too.

Well the type was well on rioja
belt.

That ruined everything.

It's just a matter of time
you leave the car.

Yes, that's what they say.

Not bad but not
well.

The belt does not cerpentina
sale.

But that is not why
the car will not start.

Do you have milky oil.

Not asked to review the oil.

Only I say.

Do not let the piston works.

In fact it will fall
first.

And probably when you are in
bad time.

This fluid can not compress
then there is this ending

what we call hidrolap.

And if you want your car back
running.

You'll have to rebuild the entire engine.

I honestly do not think that queira
do.

Costs more than the car.

If.

I could not go yesterday.

Can you call back more
late?

Ok.

Adios.

Are you sure?

If.

In question.

How much?

To fix it?

2 000.

At least 2 000.

As I said most of the auto
no good.

A new car is better.

Look, I know this is bad news.

It's something that nobody wants to hear.

You see the thing is that the car
is back and that takes up space

I need to know what to do with it.

I'll say that, leave $ 30 for the hopper
careful.

And we will take care of everything
others and that would be everything.

We can not leave your car
