Did you just see yourself right now?

You look like you
just had a lobotomy.

What's wrong with you?

This is reality.
Reality my ass. So I've made up

May I ask you this? Huh.

How many times on this show
have you seen the cops arrests

you know, killers and rapists?
Or something like that

How many times did they slap the cuffs
on some crooked CEO fuck?

What can I get you?
Beer.

Bottle or draft?
Uh, Draft.

What you see is I'm always catching drug
users and johns -- You know people...

...just hurtin', just lookin' for a
little pleasure in life. Three dollars.

What have you got against cops?
I'm nothin' against cops

Jeez.

I'd tell you what I got some against

I got something against stupidity.
Good ol'

stupidity. That's why I
got somethin against.

There you go.
Keep it.

Thanks.

You comin' or goin'?
Passing through, kind of.

I swear to god, a fly can go in your mouth
and you would've even know it

You just swallow it, cos it's like
the only protein you've ever had.

It's a good beer.
Huh?

Good beer.
Yeah.

It's from Pennsylvania.

How long have you had this place?
Too long.

It's real homey.

You think so?

Where the hell do you live?
New Hampshire. Portsmouth.

Home of the Navy prison.
Yeah, I know the place.

You don't remember me, do you?

Wait a minute.

That can't be.

To be
No way.

Sweet Jesus, Doc!

Well, Doc,
nobody's calling me that for a long time

Fuck me, Doc.
You made it.

Wow. Hey O'Toole. Look in here
He's my old buddy from 'Nam.

I saved his life once.
He never saved my life.

Didn't think so.

You gotta excuse me, Doc.
I'm shit for names.

Shepherd. Larry Shepherd.

Shep. That's right.
Nineteen year-old kid. Navy corpsman.

Once.
Yeah, well, we were all something once.

Now we're something else.

So you do remember me?
'Course I remember you.

You heard, I got busted down to EOne?
Yeah.

Most unfair.

The green weenie -
they broke it off in you.

How long was it? Was it like...
What? Three years?

Ended up about two,
with good behavior.

Oh. I see, It's not so bad.

It was pretty bad.
It was a long time ago.

BCD?

Yeah, but at some point instead
of calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,

I started calling
it a better career decision.

Fuckin-A.

How did you find my lonesome ass?
It was easy.

The Internet. You can find anybody
on the internet these days.

Well that is really fucked.

So Portsmouth,
what do you do for a living there?

Stocking clerk, at the Navy Exchange.

You're gotta be shitting me.

That's alright.

Don't you go someplace when you close?

Like where?

I don't know, home?

It'll be there tomorrow.

Hey. It's the last slice of pizza.

Do you want it?

That's it. Once this is gone,
there's no more pizza.

Sure? Going once. Going twice.
Gone.

I love cold pizza.

Do you want a beer?

You sure?

It always works for me.

Fuck

I'm feeling a little fucked up from last
night if you want to know the truth

I'm getting too old for this shit, frankly.

What's the deal with the grill
part of Sal's Bar & Grill?

Well. Gone to rust is the deal.

I guess people just lost their
taste for an honest burger.

Why? You hungry?
No. Just curious.

Hey. You know what?

We got Mexicans here now,
so we can get some chorizo con huevos.

Hell, we qualify for menudo.
You got the balls for that?

No thanks.

You want a bite?

There's something I'd like to show you,
though, if you're up for it.

Sure. I'm always up for it.

You got a car?

Of course I got a car.
I'm a fucking businessman.

We'll go now?

Yeah, whatever.

I just fuckin' love it, you know?

It's priceless.

What is?
The Navy.

They put the cock to you, then they
let you work at the Navy Exchange.

I got five people under me.

You're a fuckin' inspiration.

You know what amazes me about you?

Could be anything.
I'm a pretty amazing guy.

You turn the keys of your bar over the guy
who's sleeping under pool table

and the you jumped in your car,
and you drive me to hell and gone,

and you don't even
know where we're going.

I didn't think it would
take so fuckin' long.

Take this left up here.
Right here?

That's going in to a church.

Oh no. What are you doing?

No, you gonna love this.
I promise.

I don't know,
Doc, you seen one, you seen them all.

It's going to be good.

Jeez. What you get me into here?

See, us Christians. Brothers and Sisters.

We have choices.

We can choose to lay down our will.

...and follow God's will.

The question is, are you
willing to do that?

...Now are you ready?
But are you willing?

Oh. My. Fucking. God.

You see cos if you're willing...

...If you are willing, you
can trust and believe...

Is that's him?
I told you you'd like this.

...that God will take care of the rest...

...Yes it will.

...It's a powerful thing.
What's he doing?

...when you surrender to
God's will and you take...

Excuse me.

A Powerful thing!

When you begin to...

...take that moment to look deep
inside yourself and ask to the question.

Am I willing to
surrender to God?

Do you know what is
called when God answers?

When God answers, it is
called that you're having a God moment.

You see, when we stop to
ask our, my choices...

Are the Christ-like choices?

The dude was a first-class

drinker, gambler and cocksman.
Shh.

Shut up.

Most likely a speed freak.

How the hell did you find this place?
The Internet.

Son of a bitch.

Where people are counting on
your Christ like character.

Are trusting that you will demonstrate
Christ like integrity.

I see we have some visitors among us today.

Welcome to our Sunday services.

Would you care to stand
and perhaps introduce yourselves?

Alright.

My name is Sal. Salvatore Nealon.

U.S. M.C. Sergeant. Retired.

Come on.
Guess who this lad is?

It's Doc!

Doc. Also known as
Larry Shepherd.

We were in service
together with you Pastor.

Bless my soul.

Praise God!

Thank you for joining us on
our fellowship this Sunday.

Man, oh, man, southern ham.

Thank you, ma'am.

Listen up, Ruth.

I'm hoping that this
old man appreciates you.

Oh, I think he does.
'Cause if ever he don't,

You pack a bag and you come live with Sal.

You don't have a wife?
No, ma'am.

Neither chick nor child.

I do have a lady friend,

but she don't cook worth a damn.

She has other talents,
if you know what I mean.

What about you, Mr. Shepherd?
Are you single or married?

I married a wonderful woman, Mrs. Mueller.

The light of my life, my Mary.

A heart as big as... anything.

A real pretty girl, with a great big smile.

Nice.

She...

She had a little... slowness...
because of a thing when she was born.

What's that mean, she's retarded?

No, she could do anything
anybody else could,

she was just a little delayed.

A great mom, a great wife.
What does she do?

Oh, no... I'm sorry.

I lost Mary in January from breast cancer.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry, Doc.

You know me, I didn't mean nothin'.

We pay for what we say, Salvatore.

Well, put it in my tab.
It's ok. You didn't know.

Your tab is long overdue, I suspect.

Do you have any children, Doc?

Just one, a son. Larry Junior.

Richard and I, we have a girl and boy,
and we have four grandchildren.

Praise God.
Is it Richard?

Honey, do we have some
coffee or pie or something

for our guests before we
send them on their way?

Richard.

Yes. I have a peach cobbler for dessert.

Oh. Peach cobbler...
Now we're livin'.

You've married up, Richard.

I'm glad to see you prevailing
over your hardships, Doc

I do my best.

You, at least, seem to have
turned out to be a decent man.

I'm tryin' to be.

So do I.
Me too.

I...

I regret any role I played in all that

foolishness that happened back in Vietnam.

It's okay.

What the hell happened
with Mueller the Mauler, huh?

I mean...
Shit...

What... you'd put him in the
witness protection program?

You got him hiding under
the couch or somethin'?

Jeez.

I grew up, Sal, and I found my
life's purpose along the way.

Good for you.

What about you?

I always figured you for
a lifer in the Marine

Corps. Is that the
way things shook up?

Yeah...

I re-upped, sure.

I was expectin' all the dominoes to
fall, like they said they would.

I was ready to kill me some commies in
San Diego, but they never showed up -

Can you believe this?

People go to Vietnam on fuckin' vacation?

They paid good money
there to pictures taken

fifty-two thousand young
Americans took their last dump.

Fuck me.

So you mustered out on principle.

I mustered out with a plate in my head
and one-hundred percent disability.

And that's the good news.

I wonder how the hell happened.

It's a good story.

If I could remember it.

I believe drink was involved.

Yes. Yes. I'm sure of it.

Speaking of drink,
this is the best water I ever had.

You see, Ruth. I was on the shy side
of insubordination most of the time,

but I could get away with it, on account of
my dashing good looks and my boyish charm.

I guess we should all be
just grateful that we are still alive.

Amen.

Praise God. I told myself that.

Doc, You not gonna eat that?

I don't want it to go wasted.

Are you okay, Doc?

Whatever it is that's troubling you

then it's probably best to talk about it.

My son...

because of my son.
I came here

Found you guys.

Maybe I shouldn't have
Your son?

Larry Junior.

A year ago he joined the corps.

But two days ago they came
and told me he had been killed.

It was in Baghdad, his
convoy got him ambushed.

They told me that he
unloaded his weapon on

them and he died with his
bayonet in his hand.

Jeez.

He's coming home tonight.

He's gonna be buried in Arlington.

Full honors. Hero.

And I was wondering if
you guys could come with me?

I can promise you this, Doc.
You will meet your

wife and your son again,
in a better place,

Oh come on.

Like a moment of momentary separation.

Oh come on.

What better place did they go to?
Las Vegas? Miami Beach?

Doc knows the place on which I speaks out.

Well, then show him.
He's got a map.

Or maybe he can look it up
on the world wide internet.

One only knows it
when one sees it.

The far as your concerns, Sergeant,
it's odds-on you shall never ever see it.

Then I guess I won't miss it.
Oh, you will miss it.

You will miss it dearly,

each and every sweet moment of eternity.

Do you know even know
how long eternity is?

Yeah.

It ain't going to matter.
Let me ask you somethin'

With all the billions of people
floatin' around in your heaven,

how come none of them ever got
the word back to the rest of us?

One of them did.

Oh right, that guy.

It's sketchy on the
details, if you ask me.

I'm not asking you.

Okay, Doc. Listen up.

I'm really sorry for your loss,

but I ain't gonna blow a
bunch of smoke up your ass.

The worst thing that can happen to anybody

has landed on you,

and now you just got to deal with it.

Lord have mercy.
What?

You were a hazard when you were younger,
and now you're just an old fool.

What the hell you talkin' about?
I got your hazard dangling in here.

I'm going to ask you to watch
your language in my house.

What language is that?

Man, listen

Guys, guys, I don't want
to cost any trouble.

Okay.

Doc.

I'm gonna help you bury your boy.

I may not be able to get
you up into heaven,

but I can sure as hell
get you to Arlington.

Mueller?

I'd certainly would like to help you
Doc, but... But he has to stay here.

And pray for you,
which will be very helpful.

Richard, could I see you for a moment?

Of course, dear.
Mueller, please.

I don't get around so
well, as you can see.

It's just in the car.

I know, but I do not think so.

No, no. It is impossible.

He's comin' with. That's affirmative.
He said he wasn't comin'.

Don't matter what he said.
I guarantee his old lady is shaming him.

She's in there right now saying,

"Richard, you have to go with
that poor man". He needs you.

He'll have qualified people to counsel him.

Yes, but who will protect him
from that Sal person?

Oh Lord, that's right.

I should always go to
sideways when Sal is around.

Richard, what in the world has
happened to your vocabulary?

I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry

It just kinda slipped out. I'm sorry.

You can't refuse friends
in a time of need.

Friends?

I haven't seen these
men in decades.

You can't refuse anybody.
You're a preacher.

They represent a dark period
in my life, Ruth. Very dark.

And you represent God.

The man lost his son, Richard.

That's all I need to say.

I turned on the radio,
but it's broken.

You got a boombox or something?

Hey Doc, you can move you chair back.

Seperate. They individually controlled.

Just underneath. Front there.
That's better. Ain't it?

So, Richard.

What is the story with the collar?

You got to wear that, is
that a tracking system,

so God knows where you
are on all times?

You always have to wear that thing?
Can you relax?

I am relaxed.
Really? No, it don't seem that way.

If you say so.

I never knew your name was Richard.
In the years we were together.

I mean, it was always Mueller, Richard.

When you was a kid,
did you go by Richie or Rich?

Dick? You like Dick?

I just never knew
brothers name is Richard,

you know. I didn't know
they named him that.

Richard Pryor.
Oh yeah.

Richard Wright.

Richie Havens.

Dick Gregory.
I stand corrected.

Little Richard...

Now he likes dick.

A big dick.

What the fuck?
Look at this guy he's on my ass.

What is he doing on my ass?
Change lanes.

I'm not gonna change lane. It's my lane.
This is my lane. Get the fuck off my ass

Get out of the way. Just move over.
Come on. Just get out the way. Let him by.

Ok, fuckhead, you want
to play, Let's play.

What are you doing?
Settle down.

Want to play? Ok, just hold on.
You tryna have an accident out here?

Hold on. I'm gonna
jackknife this motherfucker!

What is wrong with you?

Wanna play? Hey.
Hey move. Move over. Let the goddam by

Alright. Alright. Shit. Jesus
You tryna get me killed out here?

Fuck you asshole!

I'm talking to you jack-off.
You fucking asshole.

You fucking get me heard out here, I will
bury you fucking ass on a Saturday road.

You hear me? You understand?

Keep your eye on the road, man
Mueller has arrived.

Fuck around I got a wife and a congregation
to get back to. Fucking drive, man.

I'm driving.
I'm driving.

I thought you were lost forever.
I really did.

Where're we supposed to go, Doc?

Dover Air Force Base.

That's in fuckin Delaware.

Right. Dover, Delaware.

So, what are we doing here?

I don't know.

You said Arlington.

That's what they said.
That's what they told me.

But now you're saying Dover.

Yeah, I guess, they have to fly in some
place first, so they fly in to Dover.

I'm sorry.
No, no. It's alright.

It's ok.
Dover, it is.

Do you want me to drive?

Yeah.
Ok.

What if something is wrong?

No, he's just a guard of the gate.
He don't know nothing.

Wonder if there'll be an
honor guard and all that?

There'll be something

It'll be respectful. You know.

It's just not public - there's a blackout
on all that stuff this time around.

Yeah, no pictures of coffins,
no reminders to the public.

It's all bullshit.

The body is in transit.
The plane's not due 'til 0800 tomorrow.

Come back then and you'll
can wait in the hangar.

Ok. Thank you.

In transit. Everybody is always in transit.

Even when you're dead.
Come on, Sal.

It is okay.
Sorry.

How much is it, ma'am?
It's $35 even.

Whoa... what's with the wad?

They took up a collection at
the Exchange, when they heard.

See? You got lots of friends.

They felt bad.
They just wanted to do something.

Here's your key.
Thank you.

You guys aren't watching this?
Watching what?

They got him!
Who?

That sumbitch Saddam!

They got him in a spider hole!

The Iraqi's in Baghdad celebrated it.

Some with guns, some with cheers.

The capture of Saddam Hussain
begins a new era for Iraq.

It is expected that the detention
of Sadam Hussain will be regarded

Fuck.

I can't blow smoke rings for shit now.

Used to good at it.

Something happened with me.

Doc's out.

Look at this fuckin' guy.

Fuck me.
One day he is the head of the country.

Next day, he's just some fuck
hiding on a spider hole.

Scared to death.

He told me not to worry.

Mr. Shepherd.

Mr. Shepherd, I'm Colonel Willits.

The President of the United States
has asked me to express his deep regret

that your son was killed in action.

Thank you.

He died a hero in the
service of his country.

He was an inspiration
to his fellow Marines.

Can I see him?
Sir, that would be ill-advised.

Trust me on this.
You do not want to see him like that.

Is it against the rules?
No.

But the Lance Corporal was hit
in the back of head.

I assure you he felt no pain...

but the exit wound in such
a case is devastating...

to the face.

They were behind him?
They shot him from behind?

Take the Colonel's advice, Doc.

Best to remember him as he was.

I'd have to see him, but that's me.

The thing is,

you don't have to listen to
no colonels no more.

Those days are gone.

I'd like to...

I'd like to see my son.

What you see
you will not be able to un-see.

I feel... like I have to.

As you wish, Sir.

Lance Corporal Washington, escort these
two gentlemen to the coffee mess.

Yes, sir.

Mr. Shepherd, come with me.

Hey kid.

Stand at ease will you,
you're givin' me a fuckin' stiff neck.

I've never heard anyone talk
to the Colonel like that.

Colonels don't scare me.
Never have, never will.

You a Marine?

I thought so.

I got more time in the chow line
than you got in the corps.

You too?

Semper Fi, do or die.
How do you think I got this cane?

Hey kid. The fuck's
wrong your ear?

Baghdad boil.
Say what?

Baghdad boil.

Everybody's got one.

You get bit by a teeny sand fly.

Fuckin' Franken ear.

They say it'll go away.
In a year or two.

You can count on that.

That's one fucking ugly ear.

This is a big mistake.

Big mistake. Hold on.

It's not like you can
do nothin' about it now.

Unless you're gonna go over there
and just out-tough a colonel.

I don't want nothing.

I'm just along for the ride.
Oh yeah.

So you two were in 'Nam with Larry's dad?
We were.

You know what happened back then?
Naw...

we were just pullin'
triggers, killin' gooks.

His dad wound up doing brig time behind it.

That's all in the past.

What do you know about that?

Sounded like he fucked up some dudes...
or some dudes fucked him up.

You them dudes?

What exactly did he tell you?

Only some bad shit went down.

I was Larry's best friend.
No one else knew anything about it.

You were with him during the ambush?

Ambush?
The ambush and a fire fight, they said.

Okay.
Okay?

Ok, what the fuck is that?

If that's what they're saying it was,
then that's what it was.

Hey. Come on, you're his friend.
You were there, right?

What happened?

Come on, kid. Don't stoned wall us.
He ain't lookin' at ya.

Come on.
It's just us, Marine to Marine.

Jarhead to Jarhead.

It was fucked.

Me and Shepherd and three other dudes
were all day humping school supplies.

Tablets, pencils, some new books.

It was our last run.

Anyway, we was always stoppin' at this
little store we called Abdul's Haji Mart

for Haji Cokes.

It was my turn to make the run
but Shep said he'd do it.

So he gets out and we're bullshitting.
Then this raghead comes up, shouts out

Ala Akbar or whatever the fuck,

'God is great'.

Puts a cap in Shep's head.

Jeez.

What happened next?

Shit man, we went off.

Lit 'em all up -

that raghead, Abdul, and damn
near the whole fuckin' hood.

We carried Larry back to
the Hummer and went home.

The kid's supposed to get
the Bronze Star behind this.

Yeah, he'll get the Star.

The more Stars the better, right?
Yeah.

We can't tell him about this.
We can't?

No. Let him have his Bronze Star.

Let him have his burial at Arlington
with full honors.

Let him have his hero.

Lord knows the man he had
little enough in his life.

You mean, let him have the lie?

Think about it, Sal.
What's more important?

I don't know,
but it's never the lie.

Sal.

Sal.

I'm sorry sir, but there is always
a sound reason for my recommendations.

Sal... he doesn't have a face anymore.

Gotta be a man now.

Hey mister.
Sal.

How'd this boy wind up dead?
I beg your pardon?

I mean. It's a pretty simple question.

What happened?

The Lance Corporal acquitted himself with
dignity and honor, and he died a hero.

Yeah, well, they're all heroes,
ain't they?

That they are, sir.

All heroes, no question.

How did it happen that this boy was shot in
the back of his head, like a fuckin' dog?

He was a brave Marine,
a credit to the corps,

and he served his country well.

Yes, he did. So did we all -

Everyone of us here.

And we do it again if we have the chance.
What's going on, Sal?

I don't know.
That's why I'm askin'.

Shouldn't we be making funeral
arrangements. Isn't that why we're here?

One second.

Were you there, when this happened?
No, I wasn't.

Where were you?

With all due respect sir,
that's none of your business.

Oh, I see. With all due respect,

Doc here ought to get to talk
to somebody who was there.

You weren't.

Alright.

Were you?

Yes sir. I was there.

Very well.

Lance Corporal Washington,
tell them what happened.

So. Where are we with this?

Pretty much where we were before.

Doc wants his son's face back.

You can't blame him for that.

I called my wife.
I'm going home.

I'll be taking the bus.

So. You quittin'?

Quitting what?

Why don't we find out.

So. Doc?

What are we gonna do here?

I can't bury him in Arlington. Not now.

He qualifies and he deserves that honor.
Here, this is what he looked like.

Can I see?

A handsome boy.

The high school girls
were crazy about him.

My handsome boy.

I'm taking Larry home.
I can assure you that is a bad decision

and you will come to regret it.

Sir?

Please stop, sir.

The Marines will transport the body for you
at no cost, anywhere you choose.

I cannot release the
Lance Corporal's body

to anyone, except to a
licensed mortician...

Or to a clergyman,

Isn't that so, Colonel?

Correct.

It looks like...

...that will be me.

Lance.

It's not gonna fit.

How do you get him home now?

What you gonna do, Sal?
Strap the coffin to the roof of your car.

We could do that.
Just need little help liftin' it up.

Maybe we can get that
kid with a fucked up ear.

Don't be ridiculous.

Why not? You know a better way to be.

You wish you could be ridiculous,
but it's too late now.

Doc, you gotta let the
government transport the

body. I mean. It's kinda
thing they're good at.

I don't like the government right now.

You don't have to.
I don't trust it any more.

You know what? We can rent a truck.
You know what? Let's do that.

You take the car, we'll stay here.

Go find a truck. Pay for it out of that.

One truck, comin' up.

I'm comin' with you, Sal. You
can drop me at the bus station.

I think I'll gotta be
gettin' back home now, Doc.

I understand, Mueller. I'm sorry for
dragging you all the way up here.

I really thought I could be of some help.
I thought we were going to a funeral.

We are going to a funeral,
it just looks like

it's going to take a little
longer to get there.

It's ok.

I'm just glad I got a chance
to see you again.

I'm very happy I got to see you again, Doc.

God bless you, Doc.

I'll keep you on my prayers.

And bless you to then.

Let me ask you something,
man to man.

Have you ever wonder -

What would have happened,
way back then, if we hadn't... you know?

Doc wouldn't have ended up doing
two years in the brig, that's for sure.

And you and me, we wouldn't
have had to see what we did.

What was that?

Are you shittin' me?

You tell me you don't remember?
I remember a lot of shit.

What are you talking about?

A certain platoon buddy, shot,

writhing around on the ground dying,

With nothin' to give him to ease his pain
cause we'd already taken all the morphine

God rest his soul.

It was nothing we could do at that point.
And we did nothin'.

Sometimes you ought to do a little more.

I have a van that would work for you,

but I think you might be happier with a
truck that's got a hydraulic tail lift.

Hydraulic lift. I like that.

What will you be hauling?

Your truck with the lift'll handle it.

Will you be dropping it off back here
or at another location?

Don'tcha know?

I guess I'm gonna be
droppin' it off here.

And when will that be?

What are you looking at me for?
How many days?

You don't know how long you'll need it?
No, I don't know how long I'll need it.

Give me a week.
Oh yeah, a week.

Mueller, come on, it's
outta your hands alright.

Why don't you just sit
down and take a load off,

Let the mountain come to Muhammad alright.

Chill.

I need to see your driver's license.

Yeah, here you go.

These are free, right?

Norfolk, Virginia?
Gotta live somewhere.

Will you be the only driver?
No, I'll have some help.

Then I'll need to see the
other driver's license.

Is it this gentleman here?

His holiness, no.

His holiness can hardly walk, -

let alone handle a big rig
with a hydraulic lift.

Whoever, I'll need their license.

What are you doing with the bouncing?
What is that

I'm speaking a psalm.

A psalm?

As in OPsalm Bin Laden?

Are you the only driver?
Yes, ma'am.

How will you be paying?

Take it out of this.

Sixteen or sixty, put a
dude behind the wheel

of a big rig, got to
feel like hot shit.

It's a rented U-Haul with
an automatic transmission.

Bigger than anything
you ever handled.

Look Sal, Doc's boy is dead.
Try not to forget that.

I haven't forgotten that.

Jeez.

But we're still alive, right?
With time tickin' fast away.

Praise God.

If there's one minute comes up
that's not too terrible,

I'd like to try to enjoy it.
Alright.

You used to be up for some fun.
I still am. Oh yeah.

As long as it is right in God's eyes.

'God's eyes?'
God don't have no eyes.

Oh yes, he does.
God has eyes and he has ears.

He hears every insult you send His way.

You believe me when I tell you, Sergeant.
There will be a reckoning.

Oh, a reckoning?

God is my witness,
I can assure you that.

Great, then - because I reckon that I would
take that opportunity to stand at attention

and say to God, "Hey, where were You

when they were rapin' children
and the genocide and all that?

Where were You when they flew
airplanes into buildings,

killin' thousands of
people just goin' to work,

Where were You when Doc's kid was just

buyin' Cokes with his buddies and some
raghead come up and shoot his face off?"

Where were You?

You see, I am not gonna stand
there and try to explain

myself to him, I'm gonna make
God explain Himself to me!

And I think, by the end of that hill say

"He-hey, come on. Get in here"

"You're my kind of dude!
You get me one of these"

Good luck with that.
I'll be prayin' for you.

I'll be open for the same thing.

But boy, if He's a tight-ass God,
then I am fucked.

I think it's time for that lube job
on that plate in your head.

Stay the fuck away with my plate.
I'm pickin' up WOR from New York.

I'm homesick.

Hey, wait a minute, maybe...

Oh no, turn that shit off.

So you know about this stuff right?
Man.

Now, I've been known
to get in a face or two,

but even I'm offended by this stuff.
I mean it's damn hard to dance to...

That is one thing that
we can finally agree on.

There you go.

Aren't you a little ashamed
to being an African American?

No, not really. Why should I?

Because being a dignified
gentleman such as yourself,

you who'd be the first to agree
that this is so far away from white Motown.

I have nothing to be ashamed of
I mean, this dude is white.

White?
That's affirmative.

White is right.
This guy is white.

Word to God

This is coming out of a white mouth?
A white sewer mouth.

Bullshit.
Nope. Bullshit you not.

Fuck me.

Well then, I ought to be a little ashamed.

Only I never really identify
with the white race.

Oh, really?
No.

Now I'm curious.

What race do you identify with?

Green.

Green?
Yeah.

The Corps.

Okay.

It's really the only culture ever
really thought made any sense.

Alright.

Let me ask you something.
Hmm.

You ever miss it?
Not for one blessed minute.

I don't believe you.
It's alright.

You don't believe in God either.

Trust him believe, he believes in you.

No problems?
No, no problems.

Not unless being trap on a bus for
the next seven hours is a problem.

Busses are real nice now.

Recliners, a shitter in the back.

Maybe you'll meet some poor redneck
and save his soul.

You get extra points for that?

Does it work like a point system?

I'll tell you when I get there.

I'm just hoping I can sleep.
I didn't sleep so good last night.

Not me neither.

These will keep you awake.
You want?

No, I don't want having that on my teeth.

Do you remember when we could
sleep in a hole in the ground,

with bullets zinging just overhead?

You can't go back, Sal.
Who'd want to?

We can't redo the choices
we made back then.

The best we can do is learn from them
and try to do better in the future.

But you're still gonna do it anyway, huh.

You're gonna take Doc and his
dead boy back to Portsmouth

and try to make it fun.

You ought to come with.

Come on.

Well, I'd better get back.

I still can't believe it,

you of all people, a preacher.

That's Goddam right.
Ohh.

Do you ever think that we might
bump into each other again?

From time to time

I don't know.

He moves in mysterious ways.

That He does.

All right, bud. Take care of yourself.
I'll see you on Sunday.

Bless you.

Why did I sneeze?

I got you.

Alright.

Ready, Doc?
One two Three.

You know. Keep wondering

What your kid would've wanted?

Drink beer with his friends.

To chase girls.

He was only twenty-one,
he wasn't thinking about dying.

Doc. You can make this
a lot easier on yourself.

I don't want to make it easier on myself.

You're right.

Guys like us, we take all
the shit 'til it's disaster,

and then we're cool,

the worst has happened,
like we knew it would.

They sent him to a God-forsaken desert...
Why?

Who knows?

It wasn't to protect America.

It's like that jungle they sent us to.

It wasn't a threat to us.

And then they sent him back to me in this,
with more lies...

a hero, honors, Arlington.

I am not going to bury a Marine.

I just gotta bury a son.

Yeah.

Taking a bus today?
Yes, to Richmond. And you?

Richmond, huh. That home for you?

No, but close. Why?

You're the one they call the Mullah?

The what?
Mullah.

I'm waiting for a bus to Richmond,

minding my business,
reading the scriptures.

The Bible.

Checking out the competition?

Who are you two? What
do you want from me?

That depends.

We're from Homeland Security.
What?!

Some rig, huh?

Hold it right there.

It used to mean something.
Esprit de corps.

A unity, a well-earned pride,
some goddamn common sense.

I don't know what it means anymore.
Fuck them.

Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em all.

I spent the best years of my life
defendin' this country.

Think your best years
are still ahead of you.

Fuck off.

No, it's true.

Look at me Doc, my future is behind me.

I got a scrambled brain
held together with a steel plate.

And they look at me and what do they see?
A fuckin' terrorist!

An apology would have been nice.

They're sorry, all right.
Sorry they didn't smoke our asses.

Don't get it.

Doc?

Oh shit. Did you forget your toothbrush?

I had to call my wife.

From the police station.

You hear me?

From the police station!

What happened?

After they ID'd me as
Reverend Richard Mueller.

And found that I'm not a
Muslim radical nor a Mullah.

"Mullah the Mauler".

Oh fuck. It's all over in it.
Our country is fucked.

Was Ruth upset?
Oh, she was very upset.

Wanted me to come home right away.
But I said no, no, no, no honey.

There are times that demand that even
old men should become threats.

Fuckin' A right. It's like
during the pinko scare

I thought I was talking

I told my wife I am not coming home

Not until we were done here.

Where's your boy?
They've got him again.

Tomorrow we go and get him back

and then we will take him home.

Atten hut.

Gentlemen. Good morning.

Colonel, whatever your name is -

Where's Larry?
Willits, it's Colonel Willits.

I've been briefed on yesterday's snafu.

Apparently, the U-Haul
agent went off the deep

end, but there it is and
what's done is done.

I hope, given further time for reflection,

you can see that
Arlington is a resting

place that should not
be refused in anger.

There lie heroes.

The details of the Lance
Corporal's death are what

they are, but make no mistake:
his death was heroic.

He was in a foreign and hostile land
doing the decent thing.

He deserves to lie beneath the
sacred soil of Arlington.

He would want that.
And I urge you to choose that for him.

Thank you. I'm going to take my son home
and bury him in New Hampshire.

Not in his uniform. I'm going to
bury him in his graduation suit.

As you wish.

Your government will fly the coffin,
at no cost to you, to Portsmouth

and to a funeral director of your choice.

No, we're taking him with us today.

With all due respect sir, you're cutting
off your nose to spite your face.

Hey. Colonel.

Did you look at these faces?

They've already been spited. So why should
we give a fuck about your opinions.

With all due respect.

We're gonna take the train.

Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

Lance Corporal Washington here
will be going with you.

This is Willits. I need you to
make some things happen asap.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Willits
Stand by.

We don't need no babysitter.

I wasn't implying that you did.
Washington's on TDY, escort duty.

You don't want him,
he goes right back to Baghdad.

Guys?

We could use the help.

Does he pull per diem?
Of course.

Then fall in, Washington!
But he takes his orders from us.

He takes his orders from me.

But, he will accommodate you
in any reasonable way you ask,

because I just ordered him to.
Is that clear?

Very clear.
Colonel.

Boy, you're a fuckin' force of nature?

I would've love to run into you
in the field in my younger days.

You really think so?

One of us woulda been fragged.

I don't give a fuck what they say.
You understand me?

Yes, sir.

The Lance Corporal is ours. He's a
Marine until he goes into the ground,

and remains a Marine for the period
he is under the ground,

plus one hundred years.
Is that clear?

I will not have three over-the-hill
veterans pissing on my corps.

You're a Marine, and your mission
is to see your brother home.

You're in charge, and when in charge,
you take charge. Understood?

Yes, sir!

There's going to be a mortuary affairs
detail at every step of the way.

You will protect the dignity
of that dead Marine,

and you will see to it that
he is buried with honors in his uniform.

Not in some cock sucking motherfucking
pussy civilian graduation suit!

Clear?
Yes, sir!

And don't let that Sal
fucktard outflank you.

He's old but he's dangerous.
Do not let that happen -

Kill him first.
Sir?

That is not an order.
Yes, sir.

And just because that crippled preacher
reminds you of your father,

Don't trust him.
I never knew my father, sir.

Lance Corporal, do you have
some kind of personal problem?

No, sir!

Then get on it.
Yes, sir!

Washington said you served?
Yes, the army.

Did you see some shit?
Yes, it was my first time.

Right, right.
You came back.

Yes.

I'm not pissin' blood and
my babies are all okay.

That's good.

John Redman.
Larry Shepherd.

Don't worry - I'll look after your boy.

Thank you.

Whenever you're ready.

Okay.

Hey, Eddie is watching them.

I have a question for ya.

When did you get so old?

I think it was over the last
thirty years. Same as you.

Me? No, I categorically deny it.

Deny it all you want.
It will not stop the clock

Nor will it turn back time.

What'd you think of that grunt, Washington?

What about him?

I don't know, he don't
say much, him and his

Baghdad boil... that's
some gnarly shit.

What do you want to know about him?
I don't want to know nothin' about him.

Sounds like he is an
individual heavy on your mind.

Ain't nothing to have him on my mind.
Just wonderin'.

Then go back and talk to him,
if he's such a mystery to you.

Everything is a mystery to me...
except you.

Please.

I think I'll go back and talk to him.
I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

Tell him he should come up here
and sit with us.

I'll extend an invitation.

Here we go.

It's bleak.

You're welcome.
What for?

Are you on a train in Baghdad?
No, you're not.

I guess not.

TDY. Sometimes it's fun,

sometimes it's a bitch.
I don't mind.

He was my best friend.

You didn't hang with the brothers?

What the fuck is that?
I saw it on MTV.

It's not a rule.
No, I'm not saying it's a rule.

Liked the dude.
He had my back and I had his.

He was honest, said what he thought.

Simple, in a good way.
He never had an attitude.

Sounds a lot like his father.

Are you on the honest part?

Doc?
Doc is not a dishonest man.

What about that brig time?

Fuck that. It could
happen to any one of us.

He got fucked.

Doc was a lot younger than us.
He was a kid.

Technically, he was in the Navy.

He wanted to be our friend and

we took advantage of it.

We'd done him a favor and now
he was doing one for us.

All the shit went down and
someone had to take the fall.

It was Doc.

Look. Why don't you come up with us
for a while.

Redman will look after your buddy.
No problem.

That's all right.

Come on. You got to get outta here.
It's cold out of here like an eskimo pussy.

I don't mind. Really

Look.

I want you to come up and
talk to Larry's father.

Say something nice.
I don't know what I would say.

You'll think yourself.

Come on.

Boy oh boy. Look at that.

Jeez.

All the shit they bought.
They don't have a clue.

They're just regular people out
doing their Christmas shopping, Sal.

Fuckin' sheep is what they are.

I wouldn't mind
being one of them.

Well, yeah, it's better
than being shot at.

Rather be fighting them over there
than in our own backyard.

Sound familiar?
Oh yeah.

See, we fought the commies
in 'Nam so we wouldn't

have to fight them on
the beaches of Malibu.

Guess it worked.

I guess it did.

Marine's gotta be
willing to die on order.

Semper Fi, do or die.

Yeah - that's always been the mission.

It's a bunch of crap.
You gotta have a reason.

To warn that you are getting in
the fight in the first place.

What are they telling us this time?
That we are on imminent danger.

Stockpiling of weapons
for mass destruction...

a possible mushroom cloud.

Its' lies.

It's the same old
shit: stay the course,

if we pull out now,
our heroes will have died in vain...

You'd like to have a little faith in
your leaders, in your country, I mean.

I love this country. I think we're
good country. Are we a good country?

We are a good country, but if you
catch your government lying to you,

It changes everything.

How is it to live over there?
It's all right.

But they sure fucking hate us over there.
Sound familiar.

I swear to God, we gotta
be the only occupying

force in history that
expects them to like us.

When you go out,
you never know what's to expect.

But being from Oakland,
I'm used to people dying all of a sudden.

Really?

In high school, one of my best friends
was shot by a stray bullet.

My father was robbed on the street,
and they put one in him.

I didn't even know who he
was 'til he turned up dead.

Jesus, kid. Lord. Have mercy on him.
I'm only sayin'...

So you joined the Marines to get
away from all that in Oakland?

No, I didn't have much else to do.

I wanted to strengthen my character.

It was that way with Larry too.
We wanted to test ourselves,

We felt the same thing.

Every generation has their war.

Men make the wars, and wars make the men...

It never ends.

Maybe one day, we try something different.

When he was little, Larry used to
like to play with toy soldiers.

He dug trenches for them.
He put them through basic training.

Mr. Shepherd, Larry was where
he wanted to be.

He hated it.
We all hate it.

But he gets sent over there, and stops
being about what you want or the war even.

Either for your brothers.

That's all that really matters.

He must have been embarrassed -

me sitting out the last part
of our war in the brig...

No, sir.

He wasn't embarrassed at all.

The thing that made Larry different
from rest of us in the unit?

He had a happy childhood.
He said that?

He had a mother and father
who loved him, loved each other.

Nice house to live in. Good food to eat.

School, football, nice friends...

And he loved you.

Mr. Shepherd, it was my
turn to get the Cokes.

That was my bullet, not Larry's.

No no...

A gray car pulled up to the house.

A Marine Lieutenant and a Navy chaplain.

Shiny brass belt buckles.

I kept staring at those shiny buckles.

The President has asked me
to express his deep regret..."

Killed in action.

In action -

nothing about shot in the back of
the head getting Cokes for his buddies.

Nothing about killed while...

delivering supplies
to Baghdad school system.

There we go.

Thirsty?

That went down awfully fast.

Well I'm drinking for two, now
that you've got all old and boring.

Might be you're an alcoholic.
You think?

I am.
Really?

I recognized that

and owned up to it.
That was the first step.

Why don't you take ownership of this beer

Don't...

I'm very good right now.

With this coffee, I'm fine.

At least we're not drug addicts.
Thank God. Not anymore.

Not anymore.

We never were.
We took the shit, Sal.

We needed the shit.

If we needed it the corps
would have issued it to us.

Yeah. In a way they did.

That shit was meant for pain.
All drugs are.

So what's wrong with takin 'em then?
Morphine? It's addictive.

So is pain.

We weren't the ones who
were in pain, though.

The fuck we weren't.

That's a different kind of pain.

Pain is pain.

When we get to the next stop,
I gotta call Ruth.

You know what you need? You need
one of those mobile telephones.

You could be talking to Ruth right now.
Even on this train you could be talking.

Say what?
Ten year-old kids have 'em.

They've practically stop making pay phones.

We ended up in Disneyland -

to resuscitate Doc, who was
metaphorically drowning.

Stick to the story.

Let me follow.
There's a Disneyland in Vietnam?

Yes, young blood.

That's what they called
the whore houses and

the bars that spring
out around the base.

And it was the company
fucking commander's doing!

He's the one who told us
to take a few of days off

and get Doc's ass to Disneyland
before he had a total meltdown.

I was having some problems.
He sure as shit was.

And the number one
problem he was having is

that was time for him to
get his cherry busted.

So yes.
How old were you, first time?

Thirteen.
Good Lord.

I rest my case.

Doc was eighteen.
I was nineteen.

One year worse than eighteen.

It was time.
No...

The right time was when I met Mary,
and we committed to each other.

Come on.

I just want to say that I think that
thirteen is still way too young.

Anyway, we were in Disneyland,
we're lookin' at this Tomorrowland.

And then we found one of the
most beautiful whore houses

I have ever seen.

I don't know.
What?

Paying for sex. Whores and pimps...
it's kind of disgusting.

Actually, it wasn't that bad.

There's my guy.

That was okay. That was nice.

Truth be told. Our Lord and savior Jesus
Christ did not yet entered my heart.

And so, I yielded to bad impulses.
Yielded. You heard that? He yielded.

I'll tell you what he did with impulses.

He drank impulses. He smoked impulses...

...and he fucked impulses.

Do you know what his nickname is?

"Mueller the Mauler". He was famous for
the five dollars, five minute special.

He was like a jackrabbit.

I don't want to spend any more money.

It's my bad leg!
Man, It's my bad leg!

You son of a bitch!

I was also famous for whipping
this motherfuckers ass

Listen.

It all seems very funny right now.

It was funny.

Well it was pure, dereliction of duty,
pure and simple. Remember that.

Actually, It was like going
to a friend's house.

And then you had sex with your friend.

Then what?
And then...

You give him money.

And you pay a friend.

I gotta tell you. We did
get tired of listening to

him talking about that
beautiful Asian whore of his.

He was so proud.

He said he had a hard-on so big,
felt like he was in a full body cast.

Nothing can move, he couldn't blink.
He couldn't even move his fingers.

It's not true.

I miss those days.

When you had a boner, you
could hang a towel on.

I used to have a Johnson that
will stand up and watch me shave.

Like this.

How was your day so far?

Now it watches me pull up my socks.

When it' goes, it goes.

Don't encourage him.

However, it can be used.

His penis...

...helps him pick up with socks.

I just want to see what it looked like.

At home! New York.

Let's not wander too far.

No, just far enough to find
the first Blarney Stone.

I believe, it's this way.

Take that in. Take a deep breath.

What? You'd do it?

What do you smell?
This thing smell. What is it?

Urine.

I love it.
Its' like the official scent of the city.

Barkeep, I will have one more drink.

And then, one more after that.

See, this is what we call a
man with a drinking problem.

No, no... I got no problem.
I got this mess.

Born in pain, live
in fear, die lonely.

Could you be any more Irish right now?

Could you possibly be any
more Irish right now?

No, I do not think I can be.

Although, I will confess to you
that my mother is actually half-Italian.

I lost one, he lost two.

Yeah, guess he thought he was worth it.

It's not worth it to me.

Would it be worth his daughters?
He's got twins, right?

Who? The cheerleader?

He was a cheerleader in college
before he was a President.

Would it be worth their lives?
Even one of 'em?

Doc.

Look here, Doc.

There's no answers in that.

The answers you looking for, can be
found in petition and prayer.

You guys ready for an adventure?

Let's go. Let's hit it

Where are we going?
It is a secret.

You'll find out when we get there,
just like heaven.

How many minutes do I get again?
On this plan, five hundred.

Every month?
Yes.

Is it enough?
Enough?

How can anybody talk for
more than five hundred

minutes a month on a
fuckin' telephone?

Good point.

We're going to miss our train, sure as
God made little green apples.

Calm down.

And if you call people with the same plan,
It doesn't count of your minutes.

That's, that's one hell of a plan.

What do you care who's on the plan?
You don't know anybody on the plan.

I know you two fuckers.
Come on. Let's get some phones.

I don't want one. I don't need one.
Thanks.

I wouldn't mind having one,
to tell you the truth.

I've often thought about it.

Barkeep, a round of phones
for my partners here.

So he and I can talk to each other anytime,

even though he's in
Norfolk and I'm in New

Hampshire and it don't
cost us anything?

That's the deal.

I don't believe it.
Oh my god, Mueller.

With three-way calling and all
we can talk to each other at the same time.

Yeah, but are we talking to each
other at the same time right now?

It will be on phone.

What if I don't like it?

We got stuck with a contract
for what a year, two years?

Just two years.
Two years.

What if you fall down?
Have you thought of that?

With your gimpy legs there's
a real possibility.

What if you fell
into a ditch and you

can't get up and
nobody can see you.

I mean, it is. "Adios Padre."

But with your mobile phone.

You get it out and if you can
see the numbers with your glasses.

"Oh I can't see, help me"

"I fall in and I can't get up"

9-1-1 calls don't count
against your minutes either.

That's. Come on.
All right. All right.

If I say yes, will you shut the
hell up so we can get our train.

I shut up.
Okay.

Hello?
This is God.

Who's this?
God.

You're not gonna get into heaven after all.

I'm very displeased with
the way you're talking...

Who's this?

Who is it?
This is God.

Hey! Sal!
This is not Sal. This is God.

You spare enough of my minutes
with your foolishness.

You should call John Redman on the train.

This will be my second official call.

By the way, when you call God,
it doesn't cost you any minutes.

He told me.

Hey, John Redman?
Guess who this is?

Yes, how'd you know?

I'm calling you from my brand
new mobile cellular cordless telephone

As you didn't know how to use.

I will gonna give you my number.

How do you already have it?
It comes up on his.

That's what he said.

Can you believe this?

Ok. Listen up. We are on...
Huh?

Okay.

Yeah okay.

What's going on?

They are on their way to Boston.

The train's left without us?
Yeah. Outstanding.

Outstanding.

I warned you, didn't I?
Why does it matter?

We miss the train, will take the next one,
ok? There's a million train to Boston.

You know what, you worry too much.
That's why your hair went so gray.

You worry too much.

We are all set.
We are on the express train to Boston.

When?
7 a.m.

We are in the city that never sleeps.
Why should we?

Come on. Let's have some fun.

Now, you take the fade-away jump shot

It's a beautiful thing of beauty.

Free throws are what win or lose the game.
Oh fuck. That is so boring.

It is true.
But boring.

They stopped all the action all the time.

And there's way too many
of those fuckin' things..

You're not supposed to go in then bangin'
around with those guys bangin' all the time.

Fouls, serious fouls

should be...

...shameful.

But there is no fuckin' shame anywhere.

Look who's talking.

Have you ever been ashamed about
anything you ever done in your life? Ever?

Once.

Why are you looking at me like that?
You know what.

Because you remember that
Boston was where he was from.

I remember he was from Boston.

I've been lookin' into, seeing if I could
find, maybe he still has some family there.

Why?

Because he's drunk.
What does that have to do with it?

You get like this every time you drink?
Pretty much.

Then you shouldn't drink.
It's what I got instead of God.

I see.

I got God, Doc did his time.

You got drunk.

And maybe he got the better of the deal.
He was gonna die anyway, Sal.

He didn't have to suffer. Not like that.

But he did.
Jimmy Hightower.

We can't even say his name.

We all feel guilty about how
he suffered as he was dying,

but did it ever occur to you that
maybe nobody would have been shot,

and everybody would still be alive if we'd all
been doing our jobs instead of fuckin' around?

Boarding call for
Amtrak Express in

2150 to Boston with
no intermediate...

Sal?

Sal?

Sal, we're gonna go.

We gotta go. We got to get at our train.

Time to go.

Can I ask you a personal question?
No.

Thank you.

Why is it that you marry a black woman?

What?

It's like you never had
a white woman before.

I know better. It was in the 70's.

Which If I remember rightly,

was when you white dudes admitted
to having a thing for black women.

I'm gaga for the sisters. They dig me too.

Couple of them... for a time.

First of all, Sal.

Who I'm married is
none of your business.

That is why I've been
so polite about it.

Ok, I'll tell you.

God told me to.

Did God told you to
marry a black woman?

No. God told me to marry Ruth.

How come God don't talk to me?

Cause you don't listen.
My hearing is just fine.

They're just fine but you don't listen.

You listen, and that's why he talks to you.

That's not what I said. I said
that "God told me to marry Ruth".

"To be a good man and
to preach the words."

So he does talk to you?

He touched my heart.

Maybe it was Ruth who touched your heart.
Yes.

It was God through her.

I was down and out, recovering
alcoholic with shot up legs.

Then one day I found Jesus...

Where? Where did you find him?
On the street corner?

No, in my heart, Sal.
the only place you can truly find Him.

I went deep inside my own heart like it was
some scary cave, some unexplored place.

Which it was.

Went down alone and afraid,
came back up fearless and

with Jesus by my side.

The very next Sunday I
took myself to church...

There was Ruth.
There was Ruth.

Everything fell into place.

That's a beautiful story.

Sorry the fuck I asked.

If God exists...

...would it kill Him to just tap me on the
shoulder or shake my hand like a man?

And while he's at it...

...if he can deliver a nice black girl
with a great ass, so much the better.

Hey, hey, hey. Me askin' another question.

When Ruth was a child,
was she a baby Ruth?

Did you get it?

No Christmas is for me.
A Doc call it a day.

That is good Doc.

Yeah, that's the one we want.

What do you think he's up to?
Wheeling and dealing

Mr. Cellular Phone.

We've got an errand to run.
We got enough time?

We got plenty of time. I'm on with Redman. He
and Washington are already in New Hampshire.

We'll see 'em there.

I don't know. How do
live without this thing?

She's been living with it all these years.
What good's it gonna do her?

We're long overdue, the way I figure.

She ought to know the truth and we
ought to be men enough to say it.

How'd you even find her?
I got O'Toole to call his granddaughter

and have her look it up for us on the world wide web.
What can we possibly say to her?

We say the truth.

Couple more on the left there.

There it is.

This red...
Yeah, that's it.

Maybe she's not here.

We didn't come all this way...

Ms. Hightower?
Yeah.

I'm Reverend Richard Mueller, I served
with your son in Vietnam.

One moment please.

Welcome.
Thank you.

Come on in.
Hi, my name is Sal.

Hi, Larry Shepherd.
Glad that you could come.

I'm gonna show you some pictures.

This one...

That's the last one we ever got from Jimmy.
Look at him.

Do you remember the smile?
Oh, a handsome man.

Lord, have mercy.

And this is his little
girl all grown up now.

My Lord.

How old was she when he died?

Four months.

Her mom eventually remarried
and they moved to San Diego.

And this...

Here's my great-grandkids.

Look at that.

He'd be grandfather.

I have saw them in person, but they called.

So you three were with my Jimmy?

Yes ma'am. Third Marine Division.

We're very tight unit.

Ma'am.

We'd already fought us a good long year,

and most of us were still breathing.

But the extension...

that four more months they added on...

...that was bad.

Some of us couldn't handle it,

and I think that...

What was it for?

What was it all for?

Right well. They said they knew,
and we just believed them.

But now...

Ms. Hightower.

We came here to tell you what happened.

Were you...?

Were you some of the men he saved?

Were you some of the men...

...whose life Jimmy save?

They told me that he saved three
or four of his buddies, before...

Are you?

Were you?

Yes ma'am, that was us.

Jimmy was a great guy.

Yeah, we've never forgotten him.

That's why we're here, ma'am.

We feel we owe him.

We just wanted to come
by and pay our respects.

Let you know that he's
always been in our hearts.

God bless you.

I can never thank you enough.

Ms. Hightower, very glad to have met you.

Me too, son
Thank you ma'am.

Take care.

God bless you, Ms. Hightower

Looks like they used to make things here.
Used to.

That's the? Of word
"Used to".

Jeez, I got to piss.

Hey Mueller?

Now I see God.

If you had any more manners,
you would be a dog.

You gonna want to stay on here, alone?

I haven't really thought much about it.

Portsmouth?

With The brig right there.

You might want to try another place.

A fresh start.

But Larry would be here. Mary, too.

You could always visit.

You got close friends here?

Not too many.

Not too close.

Move to Norfolk.
You could work in my bar.

I don't know anything
about working in bar so..

Trust me - you don't need to know much.

Your bar don't seem all that busy.

But That's my fault.

It needs new blood.

We could get the grill part going again.

I need a partner.
A partner?

The bar'd be half yours,

and when I bite it, it'll be all yours.
you don't owe me nothing.

This ain't nothin' to do
with paying off no debt.

Trust me.

I really do need a partner.

You can stay with me for a while, -

but then you'd have to get your own place, 'cause
I like to pursue the ladies if you what I mean.

And quite frankly, no offense,
but you'd cramp my style.

You thinkin' about it?

I am. I'm picturing it.

It's kinda funny.

Might be time for a new BCD in your life.
Better career decision.

And if nothing else,
I guarantee it...

...we'd have some fun.

What's wrong with that?

You are in love with that thing.

I'm tryin' to get that
fucker O'Toole to answer.

The whole place could be
burned down for all I know.

Come on. You dick.

Here is Larry's graduation suit.

Well, it's nice.

Looks a little small.

Do you think?
Yes sir.

Larry bulked up. That's might
be a little tight on him now.

I guess I could go down to Penny's
and get him something new.

We still got his dress blues.

Oh my word.

The dress blue uniform. Remember how
we used to call it, the tuxedo?

By law you wear to any formal function.

Not that we ever got invited to one...
or would have gone if we had.

Still, it was nice to know you were
always dressed for any occasion.

That's true.

Not a man ever forgets the first
time he puts on that uniform -

Then just standing in front of the
mirror lookin' at yourself, right?

I'm in the United States Marine Corps,
and I look pretty fuckin' good.

I remember loving that feeling.

Yes, sir. I'm glad to
know that never changes.

I bet Larry looked sharp in his.
Didn't he?

He did. He was proud
as a peacock in it.

I know that for a fact, sir.

You know, That's the point, Doc.
It's about pride.

That is not a sin.
Not that kind of pride.

I guess I could bury him in his uniform...

...even if.
Yeah.

It means you did something.

Fuck what the politicians did, you served.

You didn't try weasel out of it. You
didn't think it was somebody else's job.

You took it on, man, and
you looked sharp doing it.

Like a man.

I'm gonna. I'm gonna
bury him in his uniform.

That's good, Doc.

Never regret it, sir.

Hey. Washington?

Do you ever relax?
I want you to sit down.

That's it huh?

Yeah. Much better.

Why're you looking at me like that?

I'm sizin' you up.

You know what?

I'm gonna get you a new suit of clothes.

Say what?

I'm gonna dress you up for the occasion.

May I ask why?

Because I love you.

First of all, I don't need
a new suit of clothes.

Second of all, you're the one who
could really use some grooming.

And third of all, Neither one of us is dressed
properly, or we're gonna be. You watch.

The things that come into your head and out of your mouth.
Scary, right?

Do you know what I think?

I think that "I love you" thing
rattled you, didn't it, old man?

Deeply disturbing.

Doc, I don't know how
grateful the nation is...

...or how much the
President regrets your loss.

But here it is.

Your country's flag.

Thank you.

Put that somewhere and let it remind
you of what's in your son's heart.

Well, once you're a marine,
you're always a marine.

Even though I'm no longer on active duty

But if I was, I ask you, you
see a man in this uniform huh?

Could you resist all this?

No, I don't think I could.

Is the uniform or the man in the uniform?
It's a killer combination.

Kind of seductive.

Thank you. You are a very
perceptive young lady.

We all wrote one.

I gave mine to Larry, he gave his to me.

What does it say?

I don't know, Mr. Shepherd.

Okay.

I'm just saying when you think about it,
a young man is struggling out on a date.

Goes out a date, he has to borrow his dad's
car, needs to borrow a couple of bucks

Whereas an older, established gentlemen.
He does not have to do anything of that.

Sal? I need you to come with me
Can't you see, I'm a little busy.

I'm gonna have to borrow him for a moment.

Does it have to happen right now?
Right now. Doc needs us.

I'll be right back, we'll pick this up.

Bye, Sarge.

You got to open it, Doc.

He wanted you to have it.

"Dear Dad. If you are reading
this, then you've been notified."

"I was always prepared to sacrifice
my life for my country."

"You have to be ready to die
defending what you love."

"I need you to understand that I
am honored to die in this way."

"Don't feel bad that my life was so short.
It was a good life."

"I know you never wanted
me to join the Marines,

but you supported me even so."

"I had the greatest father and I love you."

"Now I am with mom. We
will both watch over you."

"Dad, I want you to bury me
in my uniform, next to Mom."

"Your loving son, Larry."
