[exotic music]

[chimes tinkle]

Ready, Leah?
Ready.

This is going to be
my longest jump ever.

You guys ready?
Never been readier.

Be careful, Leah.

Okay, here I go.

One...two...three.

Whoo-hoo!
[chimes tinkling]

That was great.
Let's do it again.

Yeah.
I'll push.

One...two...three.

Whoo!
Got ya!

Whoa!
Farthest one yet.

[enchanting music]

* *

Let's see.
This goes here.

That goes there.

And this gear connects to that.

There.
That should do it.

Ow!

A necklace?
Where did that come from?

That's strange.

Good morning, Cog.

Eh, if you say so.

You know what'll
make you feel better?

Digging.
Digging makes everything better.

Not for me.
I don't like digging.

[all gasp]

Did he say
he doesn't like to dig?

Who doesn't like to dig?

What do you mean
you don't like digging?

We're grunts.
All grunts love to dig.

Digging is the best.

Digging is a waste of time.

This machine could dig a tunnel
in half the time

it take you to do it
with your shovels.

I don't know.
Looks pretty complicated.

Complicated?

No way!

It's easy.

All you have to do is
pull this lever.

Wait, no.
Yeah, that's not it.

Maybe you need to push this.

Or this.

Ah, why won't this thing work?

[engine rumbles]
Huh? Whoa!


[all gasp]
Yay!

Hooray!
All right!

both: More digging!

Sorry, Cog,

but I think we'll stick to
old-fashioned digging.

You should try it.
It's just plain fun!

Why, I'll show those grunts.

My inventions are
way better than digging.

I wish this machine
really did work.

[chimes tinkling]

[both giggling]
One more.

Huh?

Boom Zahramay!
First wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

[chimes tinkling]

Whoa.
[engine sputtering]

What's happening?

[machinery whirring]

Huh?

It's working!

My digging machine is working!

I'm not sure how, but it is.

Now I'll show everyone

that my machine is better
than digging by hand.

Now, let's see
if we can speed things up.

Whoa!

Whoa!

That was strange.
I just granted a wish.

But I didn't hear you
make a wish, Leah.

That's because I didn't.

But that's impossible.

You're the only person
that can make a wish,

because you always wear
your magic genie bottle

around your...

Uh-oh.

[gasps]
My necklace!

It's gone!

It must've fallen off
while I was swinging.

Someone must've found
your necklace,

and is making wishes with it.

Well, whoever it is
must be around here somewhere.

Come on,
we'll find your necklace.

Thanks, guys.

Whoever found it just used
the first wish of the day.

I wonder who has my necklace.

[distant rumbling]

Do you guys hear that?

Sounds like
it's coming from underground.

Hmm, could be a grunt.

A grunt?
What's that?

They're little creatures
who live underground.

They don't have any magic,

but they're really, really,
really good at digging.

Yeah, but they hardly ever
come above ground.

[screams]

Well, what do you know?
There's a grunt.

And he's driving.

And he's wearing my necklace.

all: After him!

[exciting music]

* Gotta move really fast

* Gotta hurry and catch up

* Out of the way

* We've no time to waste *

* We're hot on the trail *

* Going faster and faster

* We're up
 and runnin', runnin' *

* Here come the chase

* Let's go,
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

* Hey!
 Let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

* Hey! Let's go,
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

* Hey!
 Let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh *

* Oh-oh-oh-oh, let's go *

He went back underground.

Come on!

I'm getting the hang of this!

Hey, Mr. Grunt!
Wait up!

Genies?
Uh, why are genies following me?

Excuse me, you're wearing
my magic necklace.

Magic necklace?
This thing is magic?

Well, finders keepers!

I'm never gonna give this back,

so you should just give up!

Sorry, Mr. Grunt,
we don't do "give up."

*

Aah!
They're getting closer.

Oh, I wish I could
get away from them.

[chimes tinkle]
Uh-oh.

Boom Zahramay!
Second wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

[chimes tinkling]

Hey, a wall!

I got away from those genies
just like I wanted.

This necklace really is magic.


Shimmer, you made a wall.

Sorry, but a wish is a wish.

At least I made the wall pretty.

Gotta admit,
that's a good-looking wall.

Maybe one of
these other tunnels

will help us
catch up to that grunt.

Good idea, Leah.

[carpet whooshes]

Hmm...
Nope.

Not that way.

This might take
a little longer than we thought.

[cheery music]

Stop digging, everybody.
I have something to show you!

Another one of
your complicated machines?

[laughs]
No.

I have something that's
even better than machines,

and better than
your precious digging.

It's a magic necklace!

Now watch this!

Oh, magic necklace, put a stop
to all digging forever!

[all gasp]
all: He wouldn't.

all: He couldn't!

Swish, swish, swish!

Whoo-hoo!
The spell didn't work.

We can still dig!

All right, everybody,
back to digging.

*

I don't understand.
Why didn't you work?

I know.
Maybe there's a magic word.

Hocus-pocus!

Fiddley-fee!

Zippity zop!
Doodly dee?

Come on, Cog, help us out.

I don't want to help.

I'm gonna use my magic

so that I never
have to dig again!

[sighs]
Suit yourself.

Magic start!

Magic begin!

Magic go!

Swish, swish, swish!

Swish, swish, swish!

Maybe this way.

Look, the city
where the grunts live.

Wow,
this place is Zahramazing.

Yeah.

Those grunts
sure know how to dig.

Look, there's the grunt
with your necklace.

[groans]
Oh...

I wish I knew
how this thing worked.

Boom Zahramay!
Third wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

[chimes tinkling]

To make
the genie necklace work,

all you have to do
is say, "I wish."

* *

[gasps]
I wish!

Of course!

All I have to do is say,
"I wish."

I wish everyone
would stop digging.

I wish I were
king of the grunts.

I wish I could keep
this necklace forever.

Huh?

I said, "I wish,"
but nothing happened.

Magic necklace, this is Cog.

Hey, I'm talking to you!

Excuse me?
Cog?

Oh, it's you.

Not now.

I'm trying to figure out
why this thing won't work.

I wish you genies
would disappear.

Still here.

Good thing he's out of wishes.

[groans]
Ah!

Why won't this thing work?

[engine rumbling]

Uh-oh.

Oh, no!
Ow, my toe!

Ouch!
Look out!

Here it comes!

Oh, no,
we have to stop that machine.

Help!
And help those grunts.

Come on.

Uh-oh!
Run!

Everyone, grab a grunt!

Yeah!
Thank you!

Here it comes!
Uh-oh!

Run!
This is bad!

Oh, no!
Look out!

Help!

Got ya.

That was a close one.

Look, over there!
Help!

And over there!
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
It's Cog!

Come back here!

Quick, you guys save them,
and I'll save Cog.

Okay!
both: Help!

Got ya!
I wish this thing would stop.

I wish this thing would stop!

I'm coming, Cog!

Whoa!
Shimmer, Shine, help Cog!

[chimes tinkling]
Whoa!

Whoa--oh, ah.

[tires screech]
Hooray, we're saved!

And now we have
lots of digging to do!

Hooray!
I love to dig!

Yay!
[giggling]

I don't get it.

Why did the magic in
the magic necklace stop working?

The necklace
only gives you three wishes,

and you already made
your three wishes.

Only three wishes?

What good is a magic necklace

is it only gives you
three lousy wishes?

Three wishes a day.

A day?

You mean you get
three more wishes tomorrow?

Uh-huh.

Okay, could you
give me that back?

Sorry, Cog, it's not yours,

but I think this is.

Come on, we'll help you dig.
[groans]


Great digging, Cog.

And after you finish this hole,

you can dig another
and another and another!

[sighs]

[giggles] Sounds like
we'd better get started.

Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

All right!
[all giggle]

Hey, you know what?
Digging is kind of fun.

[all giggle]

[exotic music]

* *

Yeah!
[giggles]

Whoo-hoo!
These pogo sticks

were the best, best,
best first wish ever, Zac!

And I think Tala, Nahal,
and Parisa will agree

that this polka-dot pasta was
the tastiest second wish ever.

all: Uh-huh.

Zahramay Falls is awesome!

[all chatter]

Where else can you bounce off
a pogo stick

and land in a giant bowl
of polka-dot noodles?

I wish I could
live here forever.

all: No!
No, no, no, no.

Boom Zahramay.
Third wish of the day.

With some flash and pizzazz,
wish granted by Kaz.

[chimes tinkling]

Uh, what just happened?

You just wished
you could live here forever

with your last wish of the day.

I'm so sorry, Zac.
I didn't want to grant it,

but you said, "Wish,"
and I just had to.

Oh, well.

I guess living in Zahramay Falls
forever isn't so bad.

I like it here.
Mmm.

Plenty of polka-dot noodles
to go around.

But these could
definitely use some mustard.

Do you guys have some
in your kitchen?

Actually, we don't have
mustard in Zahramay Falls.

[gasps]
No mu-mustard?

No!

I have to find a way
to get back home

where there's mustard.

Couldn't I just use
one of my wishes

to wish that Zac could go home?

Sorry, Leah.
Wish magic is so powerful,

one wish can't be used
to change another one.

There must be
something we can do.

What about
the Wishy Washy Genie?

The Wishy who now?
The Wishy Washy Genie.

He's a genie who has the power
to wash away one wish.

He can get rid of
your wish to never leave,

and make it like
you never wished it.

And that means
I'll totally be able to go home.

Awesome!
But Kaz...

the Wishy Washy Genie
is just a legend.

He doesn't really exist.

Are you kidding?
Of course he does.

So...where do we find him?

Well, legend says he lives in
the Zahramay Forest,

but no one knows where exactly.

Because he doesn't exist.

Or he's just shy.

Maybe I can use
a wish to find him.

Do it, Leah, please!

I'm already starting to forget
what mustard tastes like.

[giggles]
Don't worry, Zac.

I wish we could find
the Wishy Washy Genie.

Boom Zahramay!
First wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

Which way do I go?

Which way do I go?

Hmm...

Look! That must be
the Wishy Washy Genie!

He's real?

[chuckles]
Of course I'm real.

Uh, but how do you know
who I am?

I'm a huge fan of your work.

When you washed away the wish

that caused the great
Rainbow Waters flood

in the marketplace
all those years ago?

That was epic!
It was?

Oh, why--why, thank you!

What are you doing
standing out here anyway?

I am trying to
figure out where to go.

Should I go to the beach?
Yes.

Or the Ice Palace?
The jungle!

Oh, there's just
so many places to choose.

Don't you agree, uh--um...?

I'm Kaz,
and these are my friends,

Shimmer, Shine, Leah, and Zac.

Please, Wishy Washy Genie,
you gotta help me.

The mustard!
The mustard!

Mustard?

Zac isn't really a genie,
and he accidentally wished that

he could live in
Zahramay Falls forever.

Now he's stuck here
with no way of getting home.

I told them all about
your legendary power

to wash away a wish,

and we were wondering
if you'd be able to help Zac.

Sure!
But should I?

What if I wash away a wish

and something
really bad happens?

Or what if I don't wash a wish

and something
really bad happens?

Oh, I just can't decide.

This is so hard.

Looks like the Wishy Washy
Genie really is wishy washy.

You're right.

He can't make up his mind
about anything.

And even if
I were to help you,

I'd need to perform
my Wishy Washy Spell,

and for that,
I need my Wishy Washy Staff.

Great, where is it?

Oh, that's easy.
I left it at, uh...

No...yes!

Nura Valley!

Well then,
I wish we were at Nura Valley.

Boom Zahramay!
Second wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

[chimes tinkling]

Ah, Nura Valley.

But I don't see your staff.

[playful music]

Uh-oh.

Hmm,
maybe I left it over here.

No, no, maybe over there.

Ah-ha!
I just remembered.

I was going to leave the staff
at Nura Valley,

but then I changed my mind,

because what if a bird
flew away with it?

So I thought maybe I should
leave it in the Zahramay Forest,

but then I changed my mind,

because what if
a giant lizard ate it?

So I thought maybe I should
leave it by the Rainbow River.

So...
your staff's by the river?

No, I just left it at home
where I always leave it.

Isn't he great?

Okay, well,
where's your house?

There, at the top
of that mountain

on the other side of the forest.

Maybe we better save
my last wish and walk there,

just in case he forgot
where he really left

his Wishy Washy Staff.
both: Good idea!

Lead the way,
Mr. Wishy Washy Genie.

Right this way!

[cheery music]

Ah, here we are.

Now...this one or that one?

So which bridge do we take,
Mr. Wishy Washy Genie sir?

Um...this one.

Oh, no, that one.

We could do both.

Oh!
I don't know.

This decision is too hard.

What if we take the one
and we're attacked by bees?

But then,
if we take the other one

and there are snakes
on the bridge?

But then if we go on
the other other one

and there are snakes
who can fly like bees!

Oh, I can't decide.
It's too hard to choose.

Mr. Wishy Washy, you're right.

Making choices can be hard,

and sometimes, you don't know
what will happen,

so you just have to choose
and stick to it.

Do what you decided to do,
and then see what happens.

Well, I never really
thought of that before.

Hmm, okay, this way.

See?
That wasn't so hard.

*

Um, did you notice
how high up we are?

Don't worry, Kaz,

we're almost to the other side.

[tense music]

Whoa!
Um, what just happened?

The ropes are ripping!

Everyone, hang on.

all: Whoa!

We...

Got this.

But if you could please hurry.

This is really heavy.

[chuckles]
Oh, wait, I forgot.

I can fly.
I've got you.

[cheery music]

Uh, sorry, everyone.

None of this would've happened
if I hadn't picked that bridge.

Um, I'm not so sure the other
bridge would've been better.

*


And besides,
we all made it safe and sound.

True, and now
we're almost to my home.

Follow me!

All aboard!
These carts will lead us

right to the top
of the mountain.

Wow!
Great!

And now...

[chimes tinkling]


Ready?

Oh, we need safety bars.


Just in case.

Hang on!

[upbeat music]

* We're all about teamwork *

* That's how the dream works *

* Together, me and you, hey!

* Put up your hands
 and Zahara slam 'em *

* Nothing
 we can't work through *

* If we try

* With our friends
 by our side *

* You and I

* Yeah,
 we're gonna get it right *

* Oh, na-na-na-na,
 we're gonna work it out *

*

* Oh, na-na-na-na,
 all in together now *

* Hey, hey, hey, hey

* Oh, na-na-na-na,
 we're gonna work it out *

* *

* Oh, na-na-na-na,
 that's what it's all about *

* Hey, hey, hey, hey

* Oh, na-na-na-na,
 that's what it's all about *

The track!
It's ending!

Use a wish, Leah.
Hurry!

I wish we had more track.

Boom Zahramay!
Third wish of the day!

Shimmer and Shine!
Wish granted divine!

[exciting music]

Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

Yeah!
[all cheering]

Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

Whoo-hoo!
Aah!


That was the best ride ever!

[groans]
Are we there yet?

We are!
Welcome to my home.

Wow!
both: Zahramazing!

Now, let me see.

Where did that
Wishy Washy Staff get to?

Ah!
Here it is.

Great, now that you have
your Wishy Washy Staff,

you can wash away Zac's wish
and he can go home.

Yep.
Oh, but should I?

What if I perform
my Wishy Washy Spell

and it doesn't work?
Or it works too well

and you can never
come back here?

Or you wind up
stuck inside a bottle?

Or accidentally get sent to
the center of a volcano?

Or turned into a giant kitten?

Aww, a Zac-kitten.

Oh, I can't make a decision.

But Mr. Wishy Washy Genie,

you have been
making decisions all along.

Leah's right.

You decided
which bridge to take.

And which track to take.

You're right.

I guess I have been
making decisions all along.

Zac, let's wash away your wish.

Oh, yeah!
Mustard, here I come!

Wishy Wash, wash away!

[chimes tinkling]
Your wish is gone!

There, your wish
has been washed away.

You can now go back
to your home.

Thank you, Wishy Washy Genie!

I should be thanking you.

From now on,

I won't be afraid to make
a choice and stick to it.

Good-bye, everyone.

Now, which door
should I use to go inside?

How about this one?

Now I'm gonna go
through this door!

[all giggling]

Now this one!

Oh, no!
This one!

Oh, my!
