Duckett! Answer your phone.

My messages are delivering,

so I know
you're fuckin' seeing 'em.

Yo. Seen Duckett?

Uh, yeah, he's inside.
He's fucking off his head.

Bro, he's definitely
on something, eh?

Hey, is Duckett up there?

Who the fuck
is Duckett?

Oi! Any of you seen Duckett?

No, I haven't!

Oi. Oi, seen Duckett?

Cole! Get your brother
under control.

-Where is he?
-He's in Jayden's room. Go.

Dude, what's your
brother's deal?

Duckett!

Open the door, man!
I'm not screwing around.

Mate, I'm this close
to calling the cops.

Duckett, open the door
or I'll break it down.

What?

Dude, what the hell?

You're gonna break
my mum's door!

Nah, fuck this!

Cole's breaking my fuckin'...
Duckett.

Can you see them?
They're in here.

I'm gonna take you home.
Okay, bro?

Pop said you're gonna
hurt a lot of people.

Pop's dead, Duckett.

You're not him.

What are you talking about?

Bro, look at Duckett.
He's fucked!

Are you serious?

Put your phones down!

Put your fuckin' phones away!

Hey, hey, bro...

Everyone fuck off!

It's a knife!

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

<i>Mum!</i>

Sorry.

No, I am.

I just needed a moment.

Your aunty
wants to talk to you.

Yeah, okay.

<i>I've still got</i>
<i>her name in Contacts.</i>

You know... I should...
I should take her out,

but I just can't do it.

Yeah, me neither.

You thought about
what you're gonna do

when you finish school?

Hmm...

Work with your dad?

You getting a cold, Mi?

What?

You getting a cold?

Uh, yeah, I think so.

How was today for you?

What?

How was today for you?

Fine.

Hey.
<i>- Hey, Mia.</i>

<i>-Can you come pick me up?</i>
-Oh, okay, now?

-Where'd you go?
-I was on the phone.

My sister was meant
to be picking me up.

My fat mum's
meant to pick me up.

She's probably off
eating dick somewhere.

Is that Alex?

Yeah, his Snapchats
are so cringe.

He looks like my mum
in half of 'em.

-He looks elvish.
-What's elvish?

You know,
like the fantasy elves.

Shut up.

I swear he stole
one of my cigarettes.

You smoke now?

Nah, I just sell 'em. I sold,
like, two to him today.

He's such a tryhard.

He invited me
to his house to hang.

I thought you hated him.

Eh.

Do you reckon they give you
cancer straightaway?

I don't know. Don't smoke it?

Don't tell me what to do.

Here you go.

Nah.

I hate the smell.

You're a fuckin' fetus.

I need a new best mate.

Riley!

You little feral. Cigarettes?

We weren't actually
smoking them.

He's lying, Mia. He's already
had half a packet.

Need a lift anywhere?

Nah, Mum's gonna get
here soon. Thanks, though.

All right.
Well, just call Riley

-if she doesn't rock up.
-All right, thanks.

Yeah, and have fun
with your cancer.

See ya, Mia. See ya, fetus!

<i>â™ª I'm gonna swing</i>

<i>â™ª From the chandelier</i>

<i>â™ª From the chandelier</i>

<i>â™ª I'm</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna live</i>

<i>â™ª Like tomorrow doesn't exist</i>

<i>â™ª Like it doesn't... â™ª</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

<i>â™ª I'm</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna fly like a... â™ª</i>

Um... Stay in the car, okay?

Oh, shit.

You poor thing.
What do we do?

Do we call a vet?

That's not gonna help, Riley.
I mean, look at it.

Well, we can't just
leave it like that.

Can you at least
put it out of its misery?

Okay.

Mia, no,
we can't leave it like this.

Another car will come.

Mia, it's crying.

Oh!

Hey!

What the hell? Love it
when you rock up uninvited.

Love it when you forget
to pick up Riley.

Ow!

I'm sorry. I had you on mute.

Ah, cool story.
I'm telling Mum.

No, you're not!
Yes, I am!

Thanks for picking him up, Mi.

All good. Come on, Cookie.

Oh, God, you stink!

Oh, you're a smelly girl!

Saw a dying kangaroo.

What?

On the side of the road.
It was in so much pain.

Why didn't you call the RSPCA?

I dunno.

It was almost dead.

I wanted to put it
out of its misery.

Thanks for ignoring my calls,
by the way.

I haven't been ignoring
your calls. I've been busy.

Uh, yeah, busy ignoring me.

-No, Jade, don't. Don't!
-What?

Don't answer it!
I let a kangaroo suffer.

-Daniel...
-I need consoling!

<i>Is that Mia?</i>

-I'll call you back, yeah?
<i>-Okay, sure.</i>

Okay, bye.

Bye! Bye, Daniel! Bye!

Oh! All right.
I'm consoling you.

Have you seen the group chat?

You mean the one
I invited you to?

It's Hayley's video.

They're doing it
again tonight.

-No, Mia.
-I want to see if it's real!

No, not tonight, Mia. I can't.

It was Mum's two years.

That was today?

Yeah.

I just want to
forget about it.

And...

I need Daniel to come give
my gucci some attention.

Oh! Daniel's not touching
your gucci, Mia!

Hey, he was my boyfriend
before he was yours.

You guys held hands
once three years ago.

-That doesn't mean anything.
-Jade.

It's my mum's remembrance day.
Please?

Daniel can come, too, yeah?

If he's touching
my gucci, yes.

Stop!

Can you give me five minutes?

What am I gonna do
for five minutes?

Oh, I don't know.
Wash Cookie or something!

I don't wanna
wash Cookie!

Oh, fine! I will babysit
Riley, the better sibling.

Do not talk about your gucci
with Riley, please.

He has got to learn!
The boy's got to learn!

-Bye.
-Miss you already. Bye.

Love you.

"Can I help?"

"Yes, Riley,
thank you for asking."

Need a hand?

I'm sorry I couldn't get to
your mum's thing.

I couldn't get off work.

No, it's fine.

How's your dad?

Oh, hey...

You can be honest.

I hate being around him.

He's so depressing.

I'm a bad person, Sue.
Can you fix me?

You're not broken, Mia.

Whoa. Okay.

Ugh, God, I'm dying.

It's just a cold.
You'll kick it.

Thank you.

Riley, get your shit
off the table.

Did you hear me?

Yes, Mum, I'm coming.
Okay.

Mum? You going to bed?

-You sneaking out?
-Why do you always think

I'm sneaking out
or I'm sleeping around?

Because you only ask
if I'm going to bed

when you're sneaking out.

Is it to see Daniel?

You know, even if it was,
he's ultra-Christian.

-He doesn't do anything ever.
-He's still got a dick, Jade.

Is it him
you're sneaking out to see?

I'm not sneaking out!

Okay.

God. Night.

Lock the door on your way out.

-Are we sneaking out now?
-Shh!

Bye, Mia.
Oh, God!

I didn't tell on you.

What? I didn't do anything.

What are you doing?

Mia said I could come.

How could I say no to him?

You're not coming.

All right, then,
I'll tell Mum.

Yeah, well, she pretty much
already knows.

What, about you
not picking me up?

Whatever.

Yo, check this out.

-I swear it's fake.
-Mm, I don't know.

It's 1,000% a trick.

How would Hayley
fake that? Why would they?

Why would they?
They're an attention whore.

They're trying to get everyone
to go to their house

and talk about them
and you've fallen for it.

Sorry for ruining
your phone date.

Apology not accepted.

You're gonna be pregnant
by next month, I swear.

Pregnant?
He hasn't even kissed me yet.

What? You guys have been going
out for, like, three months.

-What is that?
-Even I've kissed Jazzie.

The girl
with the horse mouth?

You shouldn't be kissing
horses, Riley.

<i>â™ª Jay or the Drake</i>
<i>of my city</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck what they say</i>
<i>They won't say that shit to me</i>

<i>â™ª I'm in downtown</i>
<i>All my brothers is with me â™ª</i>

Only an hour late. Great.

Been waiting
for Mum to sleep.

Oh, and we are
babysitting too, apparently.

Fuck me.

<i>â™ª Drive through the hood</i>

Yo. What's up?

Just chillin'.

Cool.

Sick house, Joss.

Yeah.

Oh... Nah, it'll pick up soon,
I'm sure.

How you doin', man?

Boop!

You all good?

Yeah, just...

being weird.

You're not being weird.
You just need to loosen up.

Brr!

Yeah, just do that.
It looks incredibly normal.

Brr!

Just do that. Brr!

Hey, Mia, brr!
Fuck, I love you.

-Jade!
-Daniel!

Finally.

Um, hi, ex-boyfriend!

Group hug.
Hold me, ex-boyfriend.

I am lonely.
I am so, so lonely!

You right there, woman?

I'm sorry
for dragging you out.

Nah. I wasn't doing anything.

I actually wanted to get
out of the house for a bit.

Wanna come grab a drink?

I don't wanna do it.

-They want you to do it.
-I don't wanna do it.

How you been?

Dude, why'd you
have to bring her?

How you going, man?

-Good. You?
-Yeah, good, thanks.

First, uh, big boys' party,
huh?

I don't really
know anyone.

You're gonna
know everyone

by the end of the night.

Oh, good.

-She's fine.
-No, she's not fine.

She irritates
the fuck out of me.

She's literally done nothing
to you.

She's so clingy, man.
It's fucking depressing.

Oh! Now she's flirting
with your boy.

They're friends, Hayley.

You keep
telling yourself that.

All right, let's do this!

Yeah,
let's fake another video.

Oh, I've been waiting
for this shit!

Be pretty sick
to hook the kid up.

He's not doing anything, Joss.

Ah, come on, Jade.
Imagine it, though.

Joss, I said no.

All right. More for me.

Thank you so much.

I guess, uh,
I'll go first and...

Nah, man,
you always go first.

Well, it's my house.
It's my fuckin' hand.

Duckett gave it to me.

Joss,
you're a fucking hog!

Look, does anyone else
want to volunteer?

I'll do it.

You wanna do it?
Mm-hmm.

-Wanna do it?
-Yeah.

Do you wanna do it?

Sit down, Mia.

Better her than me.
Tie her.

Yes, sir. Hands up.

Mm, kinky.

What are we playing?

It's nothing, Riley.
Hayley's tricked everyone.

All right,
somebody time it.

As soon as she lets it in,

it cannot go
for more than 90 seconds.

Am I clear?

What happens after 90 seconds?

They'll want to stay.

And if you die
while they're in you,

well, they'll have you
forever.

So lame.

Hey, I'm just relaying
what I've been told, okay?

Oh! Fuck, dude!

Trust me...
It's gotta be tight.

Candles?

Light the candle
to open the door.

Blow it out to close it.

Okay, Mia.

Ah...

Put your hand on it.

No, like, hold it.

Now say...

"Talk to me."

Talk to me.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God, what the fuck?

Who the fuck was that?

Who was that?

I dunno, man. It's different
every time.

Hey, you signed up.
Where'd he go?

Mia, stop.

No, you didn't do it right.
You gotta say, "I let you in."

No, I'm flipping out.

Seriously, Mia, shut up.

No, someone was sitting there,
I swear to fuck.

Okay, I'm proving it.

Attagirl, prove it!

Prove it.
That's right, say it.

Do it. Do it.

Do it. Do it.

Do it.

Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

Okay! Okay. Okay.

Talk to me.

Hey, hey,
don't let go, Mia.

-Do not let go.
-I can't look at it!

You don't have to look at it!
You don't have to look at it!

-Just say it.
-I can't!

Say it!

I let you in.
I let you in.

I let you in.

Someone timing it?
Got it.

There you are.

Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh.

There he is.

They like you.

What?

Oh, shit! Not you, though.

Whoa.

Yeah, Mia!

He's behind you now.

He'll split ya, pretty boy.

He'll split ya!

83 seconds.
Joss, get it off her.

He'll split ya!

-All right, you've had enough.
-He'll split ya.

He'll split ya.
He'll split ya.

Run. Run.

Run. Run. Run.

Run. Run.

Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

-Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
-90 seconds, for fuck sake!

Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

Run!

Hey. Hey. You okay?

We went a bit over.

Hey.

That was...

amazing!

That was the best one yet!

Jade.
Jade, are you up?

You're not sleeping in here.

I didn't even ask that.

Isn't that what you want?

No. I'm just bored.

Look, Riley, you're not nine
anymore, all right?

Goodnight.

Can you shut the door?

Shut the door!

Sook!

What a bitch.

Can I hang with you?

It's your house, bro.

Did the hand thing scare you?

A bit.

You gonna have nightmares,
Riley?

I don't get nightmares.

I do.

Like what?

I have this
reoccurring nightmare...

where...

I'm looking in the mirror
and my reflection is gone.

Like I don't exist.

What did the hand feel like?

Hmm...

It felt amazing.

I felt like I was glowing.

I could hear and see
and feel everything.

But I was
in the passenger seat.

It felt incredible.

Hmm.

How did your mum die?

You know.

Only bits.

She, uh...

took too many sleeping pills.

By accident.

Dad was sleeping on the couch.

In the morning,
he couldn't open the door.

Hmm.

Why?

Mum was on the other side.

And there were scratches
on the door

and wood under her nails.

She tried to get help,
but she couldn't.

Jade said
you got depression after.

I was just feeling alone.

No, you can't ever be alone

'cause you'll always have
me and Jade.

Yeah.

It's okay,
I don't feel alone anymore.

<i>Wait. Oh, my God...</i>

<i>-Is it being constipated?</i>
<i>-Are you fuckin'...</i>

<i>He's won a million pounds!</i>

-You busy tonight?
-You want a turn, eh?

No. Daniel does.

What's in it for me?

My company.

That's pretty cool, I reckon.

No, we can't go to Joss's.

His place is trashed.
He's pissed.

My house, then.

I've got a party later.
I've gotta be gone by 11:00.

Mum leaves at 9:00, so...
See ya at 10:00.

Jog on.

Yes?
Yes!

Hi. Is Jade home?

-Why is Daniel at the door?
-Mum, can you let him in?

You'd better not be having
a party, Jade, I swear to God.

It's two friends.
Can you let him in?

What time's
everyone getting here?

-Getting here for what?
-The party.

-Is there a party tonight?
-Don't bullshit me.

I'm... I'm sorry...

Have you got alcohol
in your car?

Oh, no. I don't drink, so...

You're good.

What time's the party again?

What party?
The party.

Jade told me. It's okay.
What time?

Mum, I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

The party tonight.
What time is it?

There's no party, Mum.

You are not drinking tonight.

On God,
I will punch you in the face.

Are you drunk?

James.

If there's a party,
I'm definitely drinking at it.

Is that Cookie or you, James?
Will you crack a window?

Jesus, Mum. Knock much?

Mia, if there is
a party tonight,

you are banned
from this house,

effective immediately.

Okay...

So, what, you're just here

third-wheeling for the night,
are you?

Well, it's really humiliating
when you put it that way.

You'd better not be getting
stoned again, Mia.

Oh, my God! Why does your mum
have to know everything?

I know everything.
I tried weed one time.

You.

My daughter's vagina...
prohibited.

Oh, my God, Mum! Leave the
room before I kill everyone.

The neighbors
tell me everything.

Oh, my God...
Watch it!

Shut the door. Mum!

I'm leaving it open!

I'm so sorry.

Ooh. That's embarrassing.

<i>â™ª I saw your face</i>

<i>â™ª Displayed upon</i>
<i>a crescent moon</i>

<i>â™ª That wavers up and down</i>
<i>depending how the petals bloom</i>

<i>â™ª Doomed always destitute</i>
<i>Fused through infected roots</i>

<i>â™ª Searching for a message</i>

<i>â™ª But there's nowhere left</i>
<i>to exit to... â™ª</i>

Riley!

Mia!
Mm! You keen?

I said don't smoke
in my house.

Mm!

Hmm... Nice place.

That's an ugly fuckin' dog.

Excuse me.

I'm thirsty.

So, where'd you get it from,
anyway?

I'll tell you
what it is, right?

It's the hand of a psychic.

Got cut off and embalmed.
Legit.

It's a medium, Joss.
Not a psychic.

Yeah, this isn't
an embalmed hand.

Yes, it is, Danny boy.

See, look. The ceramic shit
is put over it.

But if you smash it, there's
an actual hand in there.

You're full of shit.
I'm serious.

Apparently, it was
the hand of someone

who could connect
with the dead, right,

so everyone
around him thought,

let's just cut his hand off.

White people shit, man,
I tell ya.

Oi, I heard it was
the hand of a Satanist.

The other hand's
just out there somewhere.

Out where?

Shut up, all right?

Fuckin' make me!
You just talk shit.

All right.

Where'd you buy it?

Oh, nah,
I didn't buy it.

A friend gave it to a friend
and... yeah.

-Who?
-What do you want, Daniel?

You want a fuckin' spreadsheet

with a transaction history
or what?

Just hold the hand,
say "Talk to me"

and ask the spirit your
fuckin' questions, all right?

This is such bullshit.

Oi, Riley, get the lights.

Film me?

Yep.
Oi, time it.

Okay, champ.

You know the drill.

Say it.

Talk to me.

Whoa!

Oh, what?

No way!

-Mate, I don't have all day.
-No. No...

What is it?

Okay. Okay.

Okay.

Okay, come on.

Okay, come on.

I let you in.

Hayley, he's choking.

Hold it.

Hayley, fucking stop it,
he's choking!

Hold it.

There we go.

He hates it
when you touch him.

You make him soft.

Yo, this spirit's a cunt.

Oh, fuck!

Oh, shit.

Oh!

Oh, no! I can't watch!

Oh, fuck!
You okay?

Untie me.

Untie me, come on.

I am, I am. You all right?

Delete it.

Delete it, come on!

Yeah, nuh!

Hayley, please. Hayley...

Post that shit.

Post that shit.

Daniel.

Guys.

Oh, yeah, that was, uh...
That was pretty heavy, eh?

Yeah. You up for it?

Can I have a go?

Sorry...
After that?

Just get your thot dog out
and no cameras.

Hey!

Let's fucking go!

Mia! Mia!

Time's up, time's up!

<i>â™ª Et la joie eclaboussee</i>
<i>par son sourire</i>

<i>â™ª Me transperce et rejaillit</i>
<i>au fond de moi</i>

<i>â™ª Mais soudain je pousse</i>
<i>un cri parmi les rires</i>

<i>â™ª Quand la foule vient</i>

<i>â™ª L'arracher d'entre</i>
<i>mes bras... â™ª</i>

Talk to me! Talk to me!

What the fuck?

Oh, fuck, yeah.
This shit never gets old.

Let's go!

I need a shot.
Me, too.

No way.
Come on, Jade.

You're not my mum.
You're not even 18.

And you're not even 15.

So what?

Jade, please.
Riley, I said no.

Fuck sakes.

What if we did it
for, like, 60 seconds?

-Mia, stop.
-60 seconds, Jade.

You don't have to be a bitch
about all things Riley.

Yeah, Jade.

You're just so busy
trying to suck Daniel's dick,

you don't give a shit
about anybody else.

Damn.
Okay, no.

Why do you want to do it
so much? To impress James?

To come into my room
crying that you're scared

like last time?

Did you tell
your little friend that?

I hate you.

Like you're my favorite
person in the world.

Can't help you, bro.
Your sister's fuckin' boring.

Oh, shit, oh...

-We should go.
-Yeah.

60 seconds. Please.

I dunno,
maybe it's not a good idea.

I actually thought you were
gonna be on my side for once.

Hey... I'm on both
of your sides.

-Obviously not.
-Riley...

Sixty seconds. Please.

Please.

Okay.

What about 50?

Okay. 50.

Fifty seconds?

-Yeah, just get it over with.
-Sign the form, baby!

Let's go!
Yeah, boy!

Okay, hold up, hold up.

Hands up.

You all right, kiddo?

Yeah.

Okay. Let's do this.

Riley... gettin' crazy!

You know what to say, boy.

You better not cry
after 20 seconds.

I'll time it.

Talk to me.

What the fuck?

Riley.

It's okay.

Just say it.

I let you in.

Oh, shit.

I'm so sorry.

I didn't mean to hurt you.

I'd never want to hurt you.

I miss you so...

so much, Mi.

I don't want you to hate me.

Mum?

Hey, that's 50 seconds.

No, no.
Please don't close it off.

Mia...
It's my mum. Please.

I love you both, baby.

I love you, too, Mum.

I'm so proud of you.

And I got...

got... got... got...

...got, got, got...

got, got, got, got,

got, got, got, got...

Oh, my God.

No! No, no, Riley!

Riley, stop!

Joss, fucking help me!

Get it off him, Joss!

Oh, my God.

Riley! Riley!

Fucking help me!

Oi, help, help, help!

Okay, I'm gonna untie him...

Get him on his side...

Daniel,
call an ambulance!

No, no, no,
no, no, no!

James, James,
get the fuckin' bag! Hurry up!

Where are you going?
We gotta bounce.

No, we can't bounce.

We've gotta get
out of here.

The police are already suss
about the Duckett stabbing.

They're gonna pin this on us.

We let them both
do the hand, Joss.

We can't just pretend
we weren't here.

We're fucked.

We're fucked if...

We just gotta get
our story straight

and make sure everyone
sticks to it, all right?

Don't bring up the hand.

Excuse me.
We need to talk now, please.

<i>Mum, Riley's in hospital.</i>

<i>What?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

<i>He smashed</i>
<i>his face really bad.</i>

<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about,</i>

<i>"smashed his face"?</i>
<i>How did he smash his face?</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I wasn't in the room!</i>

<i>Stop crying</i>
<i>and tell me what happened.</i>

Three or four minutes, maybe?
<i>- I'm sorry, Mum.</i>

<i>Jade!</i>
<i>Jade, frickin' answer me!</i>

Can we talk about this?

Mia.

Dad, I just want
to go to sleep.

Can you tell me one thing?

We didn't give him anything.

What happened, then?

I dunno.

I wish you'd just
be honest with me.

Right, because you've been
so honest with me.

What's that supposed to mean?

It means there's something
you haven't told me about Mum.

Isn't there?

Right.

Tell me he's okay.

No offence, I don't want
you here right now.

Wait, Jade. Come on.

Mia.

Sue, I...

Don't!

What are you doing here?

I just... I just came to see
how he was.

He's bad, Mia.
He's really fucking bad.

-Did you give him something?
-No.

Come on. I know you've done
shit before. What was it?

Nothing, I swear.

Look at his face.

What did my son
ever do to you?

I... I didn't hurt him.

Go home. Now.

No, please,
can I just see him?

You come back here,
I'm gonna call the police.

Sue...

-Jade.
-Just go home.

No, Jade, I'm so sorry...

Mi...

Mum?

Mum, is that you?

Help me!
Mum?

Mum?

Mum?

Mum!
Mia!

Mia.

What's wrong?

Are you okay?

Was your dad pissed?

Yeah.

I'm 18, so the police
didn't call mine.

They can't know.

Where do they think
you are?

Cousin's.

I can't go home.

They'll know something's up.

You can stay at mine.

Just 'cause of me and Jade.

It might be...

weird.

Yeah, but...

we're just friends.

It's not like it's illegal
or anything.

I just...

I don't want to be alone.

Okay.

I can't believe
I spoke to her.

I don't think
that was your mum, Mia.

No, it was at first.

She used to call me "Mi"
all the time.

I mean, how would the spirits
know that?

I feel like they read
what we think. You know?

I mean...

they were in us.

They could know
everything about us.

Or maybe...

Mum was there because
she was trying to reach out.

We could check.

No.

I'm never doing it again, Mia.

Sorry.

Forgot about that.

-I was such a loser.
-You were cute.

Remember when we held hands?

Yeah.

I could feel
your heart beating

through your fingertips.

Yeah, you paid me out

'cause your hands
were bigger than mine.

And they probably still are.
No way.

It is.
You have the tiniest hands.

Yeah, I...
I didn't do puberty right.

<i>No, wait, Jade, Jade...</i>

<i>Mum.</i>

<i>What's your message</i>
<i>to the haters?</i>

<i>Suck my arse! Mm-hmm!</i>

<i>Mum!</i>

<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

<i>Who's the cutest?</i>

<i>- Me. Me.</i>
<i>- Me.</i>

<i>-Who's the hottest?</i>
<i>-Me.</i>

<i>- Who's the best?</i>
<i>- Me!</i>

<i>- Who's the funniest?</i>
<i>- Me.</i>

<i>You suck!</i>

<i>You suck!</i>

<i>Fuck the haters!</i>

Please...
No. No, Rhea...

Rhea...

Daniel?

Daniel! Daniel, wake up!

Daniel, wake up!

Daniel!

Wake up!

Oh, what the... Mia!

Stop!

Where is she?
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

Oh, my God, they followed us.

Whoever we contacted,
they followed us.

-What are you talking about?
-She was sucking your foot!

You were sucking my feet, Mia.
You had my foot in your mouth!

What? No, I didn't.

-I'm gonna go.
-Wait, Daniel...

-Mia, stop!
-No, don't leave me!

No, I'm going.
Stay with me.

Mum?

Please, please, Mum.

Talk to me.

Mum.

Did you...

Did you kill yourself?

No.

Not on purpose, Mi.

Is that the truth?

I'd never want to leave you.

Ever.

I'm here.

Always.

Mia.

Riley needs help.

Oh, your father. Unbelievable.

Can you stay
with him, Jade?

Riley.

Riley, please say something.

Riley?

Riley.

Mum! Mum!

No, Riley, stop! Riley, stop!

Stop! Stop!

Stop!

Stop!

Riley!

Oh, shit!

Stop! Nurse!

Please stop him!
Please stop him!

Riley, fucking stop now!

Fucking stop him!
Do something!

It was you
who took it.

You could've fucking said
something, Mia.

Who showed
the police the video?

Think it was James.

At least it proves
we didn't touch him.

Police said there's not
a lot they can do

about a kid hitting himself.

Has it ever
lasted this long?

No.

But we've never been over
90 seconds before Mia, so...

How is he?

Every time he comes to,
he tries to kill himself.

They wanna keep him.
What?

The guy who gave Duckett
the hand said

that if you die while they're
in you, they have you forever.

Have any of you guys...
still been seeing stuff?

What the fuck you mean,
"seeing stuff"?

I saw my mum at the hospital.

And another one
attacked Daniel at my house.

Did you see something?
Uh... Not exactly.

What's that
supposed to mean, Daniel?

I woke up and Mia was...

I dunno...

Sucking my feet.

The fuck?

Jade.

What do you mean,
"woke up with Mia"?

What do you mean,
"sucking your feet"?

It wasn't me,
I swear to God.

I couldn't go home.

Look, none of us have
been seeing shit, all right?

And we all did it.
We were all there.

So, why would you be seeing
your mum?

You didn't even let her in.

Wait, didn't Duckett
say they could imitate people?

Wait, who's Duckett?

I got the hand off him.
He, uh...

I met him twice
at some parties and...

Yeah, we did the hand shit,

and I asked if
I could borrow it

and he said I could keep it.

He said he was seeing them
without it.

And then
he went full skitz.

Stabbed his brother,
then killed himself.

The brother.
Can we talk to him?

What's up, bruz?

What are you doing here?

We gotta talk about Duckett.

Yeah.

Do you know what
the shit thing is?

He actually thought
he had friends.

You guys always
inviting him to shit,

acting like you cared.

-But you were using him.
-We weren't using him, Cole.

A real friend would've seen
it was fucking him up.

But you didn't.

Look, bruz, I know it's
a shit time for you right now,

but we need your help.

Nah, man, I'm out.

Cole.

I know how much it hurts
to lose someone that close.

The people he let in
messed up his head.

If he'd just stopped doing
that fucking thing,

they would've left.

My little brother's
in hospital. He went way over.

You let a kid do it?

His body should kick 'em out.

They get weaker
the longer they're in.

It hasn't.
Give it time.

They're killing him.

Maybe it's time

you stop fucking up
people's lives, Joss.

What do you reckon?

Jade!

Jade, just wait! Jade!

You shouldn't have
let him do it, Mia!

We all decided it'd be okay.

We didn't
decide anything.

We did. We all said...

We didn't say shit, Mia.
That was just you.

And then you let it go
for two fucking minutes.

-Jade--
-And then

you sleep with my boyfriend.

What the fuck is
wrong with you?

-Jade, it wasn't like that.
-Oh, of course,

you're gonna take her side.

Jesus...

I wish that you didn't force
yourself into my family, Mia.

Um...

Did we blow the candle out?

I don't remember.

What if we opened the door
but we didn't shut it?

What are you saying?

I'm saying we do it again
with Riley

but blow out the candle
this time.

You want him to do it again?

The thing that put him
in hospital?

-You wanna save him?
-Don't fucking ask me that.

Well, we have to do
something, Jade!

I'll give it back after, okay?

Just burn the fuckin' thing.

Hey, good luck.

Mum's back in, like,
an hour.

We'll be quick.

Oh, my God.

Come on, Riley.
Come on, please.

Talk to him.

Okay, yeah, blow it out.

Anything?

I don't know. Um...

Maybe if we just try it again.

Mia...
Just try it again.

Talk to him.

It's not working.

Okay. Um...

What if I use the hand
to speak to him?

No.
What? He's not dead, Mi.

No, but what if his spirit is

disconnected from his body
or something?

I thought these spirits
were in limbo.

Yeah, well, maybe
that's where Riley is.

Might not be him.

-Well, what if it is?
-And what if it isn't?

Yeah, this is
a bad idea, Mia.

Mia.

Mia, don't.

Riley, talk to me.

Hi.

Is it him?
Shh.

Is there a boy here?

Him.

Do you know where he is?

Please.

I can take you to him.

Okay.

I let you in.

Help!

Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

No! Don't touch me!

Don't touch me!

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey.

It's just us.

It's just me and Daniel.

What happened?

I saw him.

They're hurting him, Jade.

They're not gonna stop.

They're never gonna stop.

Mia.

I haven't been
completely honest with you.

But I want to be.

Your mother...

Before she passed,
she left us something.

Something I've been
scared to show you.

Which is...
Which is wrong of me.

Because it's... It's just as
much as yours as it is mine.

Can I read it to you?

"Dear Max and Mia.

"It is Tuesday today

"and it's raining.

"It's the first time
in a long time,

"I haven't felt hopeless."

"In fact...

"I am full of hope.

"I hope you live
beyond your years

"and find absolute happiness.

"I hope you... I hope you
don't hate me for this."

"I hope you find it
in your heart to forgive me.

"I hope you can find
some peace in knowing

"I am no longer in pain."

I'm sorry, Mi.

-It's hers, Mia.
-No.

Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
It's okay.

No, she didn't do it.

She didn't do it,
because she told me, Dad.

She didn't do it,
because she told me.

She told me.
She told me.

Mia.

Mia. Come here.

Sweetheart.

She's gone.

I'm sorry I kept it from you.

I didn't want you
blaming yourself.

<i>It's not true.</i>

I'll be back.

What?

-I'll be back, I promise.
-Mi...

I promise. I just...
I just gotta go.

I'll be back, Dad.
I'll be back.

<i>Mi.</i>

<i>He's lying.</i>

Then why did you write it?
I didn't.

Sweetheart.

That's not your dad.

What?

Mia?

That's not Max.

Mia?

They're imitating him.

He's going to hurt you.

Mia, open the door!

Riley can't stay there.

Mia?
He's suffering, Mi.

What... What do I do?

He needs to die.

What?
Mia?

You have to put him
out of his misery.

No, Mum, I, I, I can't. I can't.

They're never gonna
let him go.

No, Mum, please, no...

I'll look after him, Mi.

Open the damn door!

Help him, Mia.

Let me in!

Help him, Mia!

No, just leave me alone!

Mia!

-Mia!
-Help me!

I'm trying!

Mia!

Oh, my God.

<i>Hey.</i>

Jade?

<i>You okay?</i>

I know what to do.

We can save him.

You know, I actually think
he's getting better.

He woke up for a second.

It's like he was
himself again.

I've seen him, Jade.

He's in pain.

And every second
is agony for him.

Just come to mine.

<i>And I'll show you.</i>

Show me what?

<i>You just have to</i>
<i>be here, Jade.</i>

<i>Please.</i>

<i>- Just trust me.</i>
Oh, shit.

Okay. I'll be there in ten.

Mia.

I'm... sorry.

No, it's okay. Sit.

I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

You haven't come.

You told me not to.

Yeah. I know. I was mad.

You had every right to be.

Still do.

No, I don't.

There were no drugs, Mia.

He had a breakdown.
I just... I just...

couldn't face that.

I'm so sorry
that I blamed you.

I know that you wouldn't
do anything to hurt him.

I love you guys.

You're not Riley's friend,
Mia, you're his family.

It'd mean so much to him
that you were here.

Can I have a minute
with him?

Alone.

Of course.

I'm so sorry.

Found me.

Mia!

I am ending this!

You... can't take him.

He's ours.

Where is he?

You saw.

Why don't you...

touch me?

I want to feel you.

Max?

Jade. Where are you?

<i>At Mia's. She's not here.</i>

<i>-Max needs an ambulance.</i>
-What... No, Mia's here.

What's wrong? What's happened?

<i>- She's there?</i>
Yeah, she's with Riley.

<i>Mum, she's dangerous!</i>

Mia?

Riley!

Hey! Where's my son?
He was in this room.

Well, he should be here.
He was just here.

Well, where the fuck is he?

Mia!

Mia! Riley.

Mia!

Mia!

Riley!

Mia, stop!

Mia!

I'm so proud of you.

Take him, my darling girl.

You're doing the right thing.

Mm-hmm.

Show him the way.

I can protect him.

We'll have him forever.

Riley!

<i>â™ª I've seen</i>

<i>â™ª The look in her eyes... â™ª</i>

Oh...

Did you see
what happened?

Riley?

I'm gonna be so far behind.

Don't worry about it.

Dad?

Dad!

Wait, Dad!

Jade? Sue?

Dad?

Dad!

Dad, wait!

Oh, Dad!

Dad, wait!

Don't leave me!

Please!

I let you in.
