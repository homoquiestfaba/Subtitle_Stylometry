Hey, it's me. Did I wake you up?

No.

You said on your message
to give you a caII, so...

Okay, here's the deaI.

Both of our victims
were informants.

CouId be something there, right?
COP: Yeah, couId be.

Nice work.

CICERO:
Okay, I need you to foIIow up on it.

I gotta be in court,
but I reaIIy think we're getting cIose.

<i>It's gotta have something to do</i>
<i>with how they got set up.</i>

Did you hear about that stabbing
in Henderson?

Yeah, yeah, what about it?
I got a hunch it might be our guy.

It's not his m.o.
Our guy's a shooter,
not a stabber.

Like I said, I got a hunch.
Yeah, so did Quasimodo.

Look where it got him.
<i>I'm gonna go ask a few questions.</i>

After you do the foIIow-up, right?

Got it cIeared with the Henderson IC.
I'm headed up there now.

I have to be in court aII day.
I am asking you to do this.
It's my case.

MOTHER:
How Iong you been out?

CoupIe of days.

And why are you here?

Came here to kiII the oId man.

Why?

Because he set us up.

What makes you think that?

Gary went to him for advice
on the bank job
and he wanted fuII share.

Gary wouIdn't give it to him.

So do you think
the oId man was capabIe
of murdering his own son?

Yeah.
No.

Mm-mm.

Nope.

He couIdn't have.

What makes you so sure?

I just... I just know.

TeII me.

Say it.

Mom.

Because...

he Ioved your brother too much.

I'm sorry.

And that's the truth
and that's not your fauIt.

It wasn't Iike
I couId pretend you were his.

He was reminded of that
every time he Iooked at you.

You never stood a chance.

Sorry that I couIdn't...

That I didn't protect you.

The beatings and...


Gary was the onIy one
who ever cared for me.

Why'd he puII you in on that job?

You were never a part
of what they did.

When his driver feII out,
I voIunteered.

Why?

He owed the wrong peopIe
a Iot of money.

And he needed me.

If it wasn't the oId man,
then who set us up?

I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

You've been the subject
of many of my sermons
these past few days.

I heard.

You heard.
But did you Iisten?

Everything okay,
baby?

Everything's just fine,
honey.

I was just catching up with

an oId acquaintance.

You go on home now.

Let's take a waIk.

[???]

Was that your son?
Adopted.

One of five.

Wayward boys.

Not unIike me or you
at that age.

You turned your Iife around.

Doesn't change
what you did.

I wouIdn't want it to.

I know it sounds coId,

but every good I've done
hinged on the eviI I did.

Who set us up?
I don't know.

I never did find out
how they knew about
your safe house.

When I got the caII,
''Easy money,'' they said.

AII I had to do
was guard the door,
be the Iookout.

I was in a dark pIace
in my Iife.

Numb to the chaos and--
Right here.

But when they cut
that boy's throat...

Oh, Jesus, man. No.

That boy they kiIIed was my brother.

I can't bring him back.

And in my heart I'm sorry.

I stiII took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.

Ended up in prison.

But it was there
that I found my caIIing.

To save and heIp boys Iike me.

And Iike you.

It was there
that I gave my Iife to God.

God can't save you from me.

But maybe he couId save you
from yourseIf.

I know there's good--
You don't know me.

I know the deviI
got your heart twisted

with vengeance and hate.

The Lord is mercifuI.
He sees in your souI.

FragiIe, ain't it?

That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.

Sermon's over.

Can you at Ieast find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?

I can't.

That's aII right.

That's aII right.

Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.

I'm starting to think you don't

What do you want from me?

Drop the gun.

Don't move.

SIowIy.

Put the gun down.

No.
Put the goddamn gun down.

No! This is my job!

I finish my job.

How you gonna finish this
when you're dead?

So you're the guy that hired me.

You shouIdn't
have done that.

I had to finish what I started.

Why'd you hire me then?

I didn't think I was up to it.

After you missed him,
I figured I shouId get invoIved

before he came gunning for me.

He didn't even know about you.

I figured that out when
he didn't finish me off
at the hospitaI.

His brother's girIfriend
was my informant down in L.A.

She toId me about the job.

<i>Hired some more of my informants</i>

Now?

Hey.

I forgot to pay you.
