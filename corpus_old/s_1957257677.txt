[thunder rumbling]

I bet the monster's done it.

The ones under my bed.

Did it, not done it.

And no, they didn't.

There's nothing under
your bed, baby doll,

just a couple of quilts.

I hear him under
there at night.

Scraps could hear him too.

Hush now.

We're going back to the house.

Okay.

Shoo.

[crow cawing]

Keep Goldie in the house.

I'm gonna take care of it.

[sinister music]
[crows cawing]

[ominous music]

[thunder rumbling]
[lightning crackling]

[melancholy music]

[thunder crashing]

[thunder crashing]

[crickets chirping]

[door creaking]

[somber music]

[chair creaking]

I think that chair's
on its last leg.

That makes two of us.

What are you
looking for out there?

Ghosts, I reckon.

[child giggling]

I think I found one.

Who's under there? [laughs]

Did I scare you?

Yes.

Are you ready for bed?

No.

Why not?

Will you check?

There's no monsters
under there, Junebug.

Please?

Okay.

It's all clear.

You know what?

A long time ago,

an Indian medicine
woman gave me this.

She told me

that it would protect
the wearer from darkness.

[gentle music]

Is it really true?

It's really true she said it.

Listen, I'll tell you
something I know is true.

If any monster ever
tries to hurt you,

it's gonna find out real quick,

your daddy's the scariest
thing in the dark.

Very scariest thing, okay?

Go to sleep.

[somber music]

You're doing it again.


Warming up your
trigger finger.

You do that whenever you're
thinking of mischief.

Maybe you better
find something else

to occupy my mind then.

Well, maybe I'll
just find a better way

to warm up your finger.

[both laughing]

[gentle music]

[sinister music]

[explosion booming]
[men screaming]

[kettle whistling]

[slow suspenseful music]

Turmoil and seething.

As if this earth,
in fast, fit pants

were breathing a
mighty fountain.

He was forced.

Men whose swift path.

Fragments, like rebounding hail

or chaffy grain beneath
the threshers flail.

Christ almighty.

That's pretty.

[slow suspenseful music]

Well howdy, captain!

[gun thudding]

[slow suspenseful music]

[gun firing]

[guns firing]

[suspenseful music]
[gun firing]

[crows cawing]

[suspenseful music]

[arrow whooshing]
[man groaning]

[tense music]

[slow suspenseful music]

[boards thudding]

He give us the slip?

Think he gave us the shaft.

[gun fires]

Dammit!

Drop the pistol.

[Chancho speaking
in foreign language]

Drop the pistol.

Who the hell are you?

Allow me to answer your
question with a question.

Dropped the pistol?

[gun fires]

Son of a bitch.

Salvador Guevara,

we are sworn officers
of the court.

We have a warrant
for your arrest.

[gun fires]

Drop the pistol, Chancho,

before you do something
you're gonna regret.

He's already done that.

I swallowed my chaw.

Negotiations are fucking over.

You going in?

He's coming out.

Like hell he is.

He's hold up in there
tighter than a nuns nasties.

Well I gave him high
marks for holding up.

I have to sorely fault him
for his choice of hole.

You know, it's a shame
somebody with your talents

couldn't have applied himself
in a more positive direction.

Instead of just causing chaos,

you could've served
some real purpose.

Well, that's where we have
to agree to disagree, Captain.

The way I see it,

causing chaos is my purpose.

[suspenseful music]

[flame whooshing]

[explosion booming]

[men coughing]

Well, he dropped the pistol.

He sure held fast to
this though, didn't he.

[suspenseful music]

Don't look like
$5,000, don't he?

One man's trash.

What about that?

What about it?

Is it gold?

Tastes like it.

So?

So we turn it
into the marshal,

along with this
smoking sack of shit.

We're bastards, gentlemen.

We don't need to
be greedy bastards.

[lively music]
[group chattering]

Hey. [clicks tongues]

on you, cow puncher.

I surrender.

Am I wanted man?

Very wanted.

Deeply wanted.

There was a time I had
a $3,000 price on my head.

Your head's not even
your most valuable part.

Come inside and dance with me?

I'm a respectable young woman.

I can't be seen dancing
with a desperate outlaw.

Afraid people will
get the right idea?

[lively music]
[group chattering]

[lively music]
[group chattering]

What were you doing
out here anyway?

I needed to tell
you something.

Tell me something?

Been rolling around the
hay with somebody else?

We're both rolling around
the hay with somebody else.

[lively music]

Everybody!

Next round's on me.

[group cheers]

[lively music]

[door clanging]

Well, well, well.

Looks like we
captured some savages.

Just one small step
from the jungle

to the zoo, eh, boys?

Captain Potter,

Sergeant Lexington,

and Mr. Ninekiller.

Where were you
three last evening?

Oh, I don't know.

Where are we now?

Take a guess.

Well, the whole place
is empty of charm,

full of old fools,

and it, damn, smells like piss.

I'm gonna have to say
either a convalescent home

or Fort Blue.

Deep in the
bowels of Fort Blue.

Exactly where a couple of
troublesome turds like you belong.

That'll do, major.

Major?

That's right.

See the star?

Makes me a major.

of course it is,

just like sticking feathers
up my ass makes me a chicken.

Enough.

Rumor has it the Wolf Hounds
were entertaining last night.

We're always
entertaining, Colonel.

Last night we were
positively enthralling.

Over near Catches Hollow?

Because the town folks
tell me they saw you

in the area last evening.

If they remember last night,

then trust me,
they weren't there.

You like this flask, Sergeant?

We found it in the
charred heaping ashes

of the Gregor coal
mining concern,

what's left of it.

It reminds me of you,

not just because it's
battered all to hell,

and leaking combustible fluids.

But because it's got your
goddamn name etched on it.

Horse shit.

Yeah, the guy that
you captured, Guevara,

well, he was in the area

to give information
to a Union spy.

But he managed to
get himself detonated

before he could do that.

You're welcome.

Did he have anything on him?

Old locker colt,

turned it into the marshal.

Anything else?

Like what?

Like a golden
necklace, an amulet,

about yay big.

Nope, nothing like that.

Why?

300 years ago,

the Spanish laid waste to
the Aztec and Incan empires.

They carted off tons
of gold and jewelry,

but a rumor persisted

of another empire
far to the North,

older and richer,

with cities made of gold,

and a vast fortune buried
underground and a sacred vault.

You see, legend says that
the treasure was buried

as part of an offering
for an underworld deity.

Snake god named Supai.

Apparently the high priest
that did the offering

fashioned a map in the
form of a golden amulet.

The centerpiece had
three interlocking pieces

representing earth,
heaven, and hell.

After that, he broke
it into three parts,

scattered it so that nobody

could find the treasure

unless they were worthy.

Chancho reportedly
had the first.

The second it's
lost in the wind,

but the third and final piece,

the Union says they
know where it is,

and they've sent a full
company to recover it.

So where is it?

La Mojarra.

Jesus Christ.

As I recall, you boys
tried that once before,

13th cavalry.

It was a dead end.

Yeah.

In more ways than one.

New information says there's
some sort of secret passage

at the base of the canyon,

hidden doorway to a cave

locals call Boca del Inferno.

The hell's mouth.

[slow suspenseful music]

We need a small
team of marauders

to get there ahead of the Union,

find the three pieces

and bring 'em back here.

Well, it sounds
like a hell of a team.

Sure hope you find them.

Would you be so kind
as to have the valet

fetch our personal effects?

Your personal effects
are being held here,

as are you.

What weapon you got

you think you can
accomplish that?

This one.

Seems that in light of
last night's incident,

the general is revoking
all special privileges,

contingent upon your
assistance with this matter.

The answer's no.

I wasn't asking a question,

and neither was the general.

You wolf hounds have
spent the last three years

racking up a list of crimes
that would make the devil blush.

Now we've been willing
to look past it

because of your assistance
with the Confederacy.

But if you three refuse now,

you'll be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

Your free ride is over.

Now there's the case,

and there's the door.

It's a package deal.

[slow suspenseful music]

This is nice.

Can we break out of this?
[drums rolling]

No, if we break out,

we're just gonna have 600
regulars out looking for us.

No 600 regulars who can't
find their own assholes.

Some assholes
are hard to miss.

Touche.

Is there another
way out of this cell?

Yeah, sure.

Chancho's way.

[drum rolling]

[dramatic music]

[birds chirping]

One week, gentlemen,

to find all three
pieces of the puzzle

and bring 'em back
here in seven days.

Don't sweat it, Colonel.

Hell, the good Lord made
the entire earth in six.

[suspenseful music]


without Chancho's
godforsaken necklace.

We'll just have to find it.

Good luck with that.

The marshal has it,

it's halfway up
the coast by now.

Some horse tits.

Well I'll check the coast.

I'll check the tits.

[soft music]

And every minute we
spend trying to find it

is time we can't afford to lose

if the union's is
headed to La Mojarra.

We can move a hell of a lot
faster than a full company.

What I need right
now is a bed, a bath,

and a bordello,

no particular order.

You know, it sort of
looks like you, Lex.

Why's that?

'Cause we're both
hung like this?

Come here, you beautiful bitch.

Did I or did I not
stand here yesterday

and say let's not
be greedy bastards?

Sorry, captain.

Something about
the sight of blood,

it just brings out
the parasite in me.

Who's thirsty?

[lively music]
[group chattering]

Don't look like a map to me.

Barely even looks
like a necklace.

It's a start.

Be ready in the morning, boys.

Where you headed?

We ain't home just yet.

Like hell we ain't.

We gotta try.

Stay out of jail.

We're leaving at sun up.

[man speaking in
foreign language]

No.

No gracias. [speaks
in foreign language]

[soft instrumental music]

[ominous music]

[flame whooshing]

I knew this fella in Toledo,

such a smooth pickpocket.

We used to call
her sticky fingers.

Now you're no sticky
fingers cupcake,

but I got to tell you,

that was pretty god dang smooth.

Were the mariachis in on it,

or was that just sort
of like serendipity?

Know what, don't tell me.

I like not knowing.

This doesn't belong to you.

Well, unless you're a
serpent god from the underworld

I don't expect your name's
written on it either.

So I guess we'll
just have to say

that possession is nine tenths.

Strong words from a man
who doesn't posses it.

I'm what you call an optimist.

[slow suspenseful music]

You know, if you're
playing the odds

that I've got some
sense of chivalry,

that's a bad bet.

Oh no, I'm doing a man's work.

I expect to earn a man's wages.

That a girl.

I'm counting to three.

I'm counting to one.

[glass shattering]
[dramatic music]

[woman coughing]

Didn't catch that.

They were...

[dramatic music]

I warned you boys,

when you shoot at the king,

you better kill the king.

[man speaking in
foreign language]

As a general rule,

I try not to draw down any
less than five at a time

but I'll tell you what,

if it makes you feel any better,

I can draw
left-handed. [chuckles]

Truth be told,

I'd kind of like to keep
my right hand free anyway,

for your sisters.

[dramatic music]

[gun firing]

[dogs barking]

[dramatic music]

Dadgummit!

[dramatic music]

[woman coughing]

Three.

Don't.

You need me.
Why?

Is there a sudden shortage
of treacherous whores?

Chancho was my husband.

My condolences.

So fucking what?

So I'm the only person alive

who knows where to find
the other two pieces

of that amulet.

And you'll help us what?

Out of the kindness
of your heart?

No.

But I'll help you for

$10,000.

That's what I call
a high dollar hooker.

It's twice the
price you collected

for my husband's head,

you fucking cabron.

[tense music]

[slow suspenseful music]

You a ghost?

Beg your pardon?

Only people that walk around

in the middle of the
night in a graveyard

are gravediggers, grave
robbers, and ghosts.

Looking for a friend of mine,

used to live around here.

Captain Benjamin Cook.

Ole Captain Cook.

Yeah, you know where
I might find him?

Yep.

About 20 yards that way.

Six feet down.

He's dead.

He died about four years ago.

He a friend of yours?

Well tell you the truth,

he was an ornery old cunt,

and nobody much liked him.

You know, there was a time

I would knock you to
the ground for that.

There was a time you
could've done it too.

How you been, Captain?

Busy.

What do you want?

Came out here looking for you.

Right here, right
where I've been every day

for the past six years.

You're right.

There's six years between us.

I don't know how to bridge that.

You just have
to treat the river

like it's a puddle and skip
over it, you know, small talk.

Okay.

How's your day?

I buried my dog.

How was yours?

Woke up in jail.

We need smaller
talking than this.

Well, I'll drink to that.

[light tense music]

Have a seat.

What are these?

Some of the rich folks

are buried with pull cords

in case they're buried alive.

Shit.

I'm putting together a crew

and I want you to come with me.

You want me to come with you?

Where to?

La Mojarra.

[slow suspenseful music]

I'd offer you another drink,

but I think you've had enough.

You must have more
goddamn spirits in you

than the church yard.

I'm prepared to pay you.

Ain't enough cash
money in all the world.

We need a guide, Cook.

You need a miracle.

Hundred men left on
that raid six years ago.

You're the only
one to come back.

And to quite the
hero's welcome too, huh?

They threw me in jail,

took away my rank.

Man's more than a rank, Cook.

Oh, is that a fact,

Captain Potter?

Fact is, you used to be

the deadliest son of
a bitch I ever met.

You were a wolf
hound, goddammit.

Yeah.

But you fled the
field of battle.

You abandoned your
brothers in arms.

The only reason you
could give for it

was all sorts of nonsense

about monsters and darklings.

All sorts of nonsense,

just happened to be the truth.

Doesn't matter.

You came under attack
and you ran from it.

The whole 13th
Calvary ran from it.

I just ran fastest.

Imagine if all the
evil in the world

has come shambling
out of the darkness,

grim reaper himself.

What would you do?

I'd show him how
a wolf can fight.

[mysterious music]

I missed you Sully.

I'm sorry.

It took me six years
to make this walk.

I'm sorry you had to
make it for nothing,

'cause I'm not
going on any raid,

not to La Mojarra.

Still haven't heard my offer.

Go on back to
Fort Blue, Captain.

There ain't nothing
you can offer me

to change my mind.

I can get you your land back.

[mysterious music]

What?

I can have you
reinstated as an officer

and get your land
returned to you.

Ole Dutch Taverson
owns this land now.

Taverson owned it yesterday.

I own it today.

Tomorrow it could be yours.

You mean you'd give
me my old life back,

just like that, for nothing?

No, not for nothing,

in exchange for your
help on this mission.

Don't do this.

You can't do this.

I can work for it for
as long as you want,

but you can't ask
me to go back there.

That's not fair.

You lost your
land and your rank

on a failed mission
to La Mojarra.

You can get them both
back on a successful one.

That couldn't be any
more fair, that's,

hell, that's fucking circular.

I need some time
to think on it.

Time's a luxury I ain't got.

We're leaving tomorrow
morning at sun up.

The old haunted wishing
well at Raven's Roost.

You'll be there or you won't.

[soft music]

A wolf don't beg.

[intense music]

All right, you
got two bedrolls,

and a can of tuna.


= You break it, pecker
wood, and you bought it.

Add it to my bill.

Now you can break
it all you want.

Why do we say, Gabriel?

Thank you.

Welcome.

We're about to be
on our way, folks.

You like us, Mister?

Going looking for gold?

In a manner of speaking.

I reckon these men
deal mostly in cash, son.

Head on out to the wagon now.

Keep your ma safe out there.

Don't need to
worry about that.

I can shoot the eye out
of a hawk at 500 yard.

Damn useful if they
get attacked by hawks.

[dogs barking]

[metal clanging]

Lex, you son of a bitch.

[mysterious music]

[crow cawing]


happened to you last night?


Took in a local band.


the widow Guevara

and our new business partner.

We waiting on anybody else?


Let's go.

Come on.

[mysterious music]

[crow cawing]

[soft music]

That's a secret of
relic of my people

you're defiling with your spit.

What's your name?

Dolorosa.

Well shut up, Dolorosa.

And if it's so god dang sacred,

then why were you and Chancho

trying to sell it off
in the first place?

My people are starving.

So you decided to
sell your birthright

for a mess of pottage, huh?

That's a shame.

doesn't know shame.

[soft tense music]

In the bottom of
his case of whiskey.

[Lex laughs]

Make it in places I need
three mirrors to even see.

[slow suspenseful music]

Jesus.

A Tonco wouldn't do this.

Nobody would.

[slow suspenseful music]

Anybody else
find the freshness

of that blood a
might unsettling?

What were they doing
way the hell out here?

Hunting wolves.

From the look at those pelts,

they took a few skins.

Yep,

and something took theirs.

[slow suspenseful music]

Those symbols mean
anything to you?

It means we need
to keep moving.

Come on.

[mysterious music]

looking for something

the Spanish buried here,

how the hell old
is this graveyard?

Your white settlers
built a cemetery

on top of an ancient
burial mound of my people.

And an alter to your new god,

on top of a temple
to a much older one.

[thunder crashes]

[mysterious music]

[shovel thudding]

[fist thudding]

[dramatic music]

Christ!

Only take the amulet.

Don't disturb the other pieces.

[slow suspenseful music]

Pass it up.

Throw the rope down.

[thunder rumbling]

[mysterious music]

[body thudding]
[tense music]

Well, well, well,

just the big, bad wolf hounds.

Keller?

Or is it the
three little pigs?

This might be cold comfort,

but for what it's worth,

I did try to spare you this.

I assured the Colonel he
didn't need to hire marauders,

he already had the
perfect tool for the job.

You're a perfect
tool, all right.

Huffing and
puffing to the end.

This isn't the end, Keller.

You got one piece.

You planning to come down here

and take the other one?

As appealing as that
sounds, little pig,

I haven't the time to roll
around in the mud with you.

Afraid you'll get your
hands a little dirty?

No, it's just been
enough mudslinging

for one day, Captain.

You've already
lost enough ground.

Don't you think?

[mysterious music]

Son of a bitch!

And with that,

I must bid the three
of you a fond ado,

or adios, as the case might be.

[mysterious music]

Something about this place,

spookin' the horses.

Can't say I blame them.

Stay here with Lyles and Nunley.

When we're safely gone,

put a bullet in
those raiders' heads.

Cover the grave up, no traces.

Yes sir.

[mysterious music]

Ever think you'd end
up in a place like this?

A graveyard?

Yeah.

[wolves howling]

I told you, those are
not to be disturbed.

Can't a fella at least
die doing what he loves?

Captain Potter.

I had the honor of fighting
along side you at Red Bow.

[dramatic music]

I'll make it a clean death.

What a tribute.

[wolf growling]

You kill the woman.

[dramatic music]
[man screaming]

[gun fires]
[wolves growling]

[gun firing]

[wolves howling]

[slow suspenseful music]

[wolf howling]
[wolves snarling]

[wolf growling]

Fuck this.

[slow suspenseful music]

[dirt clattering]

We getting bigger or is
this grave getting smaller?

Walls are closing in.

Go.

Go, go, go, go.

Go, go, go.

[dramatic music]

[animals howling]

What are they?

Skin walkers.

[dramatic music]

[wolf growling]

[gun fires]

[wolf softly growling]

You're late.

I thought you meant the other

haunted wishing well
at Raider's Roost.

What'd I miss?

Digging up buried treasure,

fighting werewolves,

business as usual.

Welcome aboard, captain.

Sergeant.

Cook.

Well, at least them calvary boys

was nice enough to leave
their horses behind for us.

And a shit load of TNT.

What were they gonna do?

Blast their way
into Hell's mouth?

Doesn't matter.

They don't need it.

They have both
pieces of the amulet.

Yeah, and while we're standing
around holding our dicks,

they're getting further
away ever minute.

No, not with this storm
coming in, they ain't.

We'll hold up here.

Get started in the morning.

What the hell lit a fire in
your ass all of a sudden?

Somebody went to a
God awful lot of trouble

to bury that peace
and keep it safe.

And they're using this
for window dressing.

Now it seems to me

that maybe we should
entertain the possibility

that this serpent God's treasure

ain't just a fairy tale.

And if it is,

maybe we're looking for
one hell of a happy ending.

You're making the
conquistadors' mistake.

Presuming that my ancestors
share your value system.

That real treasure must mean
something you can touch,

is something you can spend.

Well, what the hell
else would it mean?

There is no happy ending.

Those two pieces were the
only way to La Mojarra,

and the amulet,

the only safe talisman
against the darkness of Supai.

You're all arrogant pups

who think this is
some sort of game.

Well the game is over.

We ain't pups, sweetheart.

We're wolf hounds.

Game ain't over till we win it.

I'm not taking you
one step further.

You wanna head on
home without pay?

And straight through the
middle of Indian territory?

Go on, be my guest.

I ain't crawling
back to Fort Blue

with my tail tucked
between my legs.

How do you expect to go
forward without the guide?

Got us a guide.

Captain Cook.

You think you can get us
to where X marks the spot?

Yo ho.

[slow suspenseful music]

[horse neighs]

[soft music]

Lex, Cook, you're with me.

Ninekiller, stay with the woman.

[slow suspenseful music]

[somber music]

War party?

Strange they killed the boy.

Normally, they take
the young ones to sell.

He got in the way.

He was trying to protect her.

Which way are they headed?

South.

Saddle up.

Captain, maybe we want to
stick to the task at hand,

patrolling Indian
trails, that's what they

overpay the rangers for.

This ain't really our job.

It is today.

[mysterious music]

[woman humming]

afraid my rabbit stew

would attract wolves.

Peace to the camp, ma'am.

We ain't wolves.

We just a couple of strays

who happened to be down
wind from your cook fire.

Strays with sharp teeth.

I'm afraid there's an Indian
war party out in these woods.

Think they crossed the
river back at the shallows

a mile from here.

You out here all by yourself?

Not anymore.

I got two strong
men to protect me.

You should know

that strong men
with drawn pistols

may not have any of my stew.

I think that a strong
man is a drawn pistol

will get as much
stew as he wanted.

Captain, I think
you're scaring the lady.

No I ain't.

Now the question
is, why I ain't.

I just said there's an Indian
war party in these woods,

and she's sitting there,
cool as a mountain spring.

Where's your husband?

I don't have one.

Your left hand says you do.

My left hand
isn't that bright.

I wear this ring to
discourage suitors.

My only husband is
an imaginary one.

Your imaginary husband
cut that firewood?

Does he wear them boots?

Those boots are mine.

My, my, what
big feet you have.

I was worried
about drawing wolves,

but it seems I
caught a fox instead.

I ain't caught
just yet, sweetheart.

Like hell you ain't.

[gun cocks]

Now everybody stay airish.

Christ on a cracker, Potter,

is that you?

It's me.

Well, this here's John
Sullivan Potter boys,

me and him's been through
the mill together.

The hell brings
you to my fireside?

Following the smoke.

Wagon train full of
women and children

got waylaid a ways back.

Well now that's a shame.

Ain't it just.

Injuns, I expect.

Nope.

Some cowards sure done it
to make it look that way.

And the big bugs at Ford Blue

got you boys mission aid now.

Is that it?

Passin' through the
highways and the hedges

looking for poor sinners.

I used to know,

he'd make an unlikely
evangelist in that quarter.

You must have had some winter.

You had quite a fall.

Christ, Grady, what
kind of monster are you?

The patient kind.

My patience done run out.

Now you tell your boys

to slip their fingers
off them triggers,

and you all boom the fuck along.

[soft tense music]

[jukebox music]

That's as pretty as
she's getting, Potter.

It's airy that,

are this Mexican standoff.

[gun cocks]
[slow suspenseful music]

in the mood for Mexican.

Lex.

Grady.

Still quiet as
a damn door mouse.

Yeah, and you're
still dumb as one.

He's smart enough
to count, bushwhacker.

You're still outgunned.

Well, only if you're
counting men of low caliber.

See Captain, the buckle
bunny behind you,

he's got a .25 to the
back of your head,

which for close quarters,

it ain't a bad choice.

As the .25 has enough force
to penetrate the skull,

but not enough
sufficient velocity

to cleanly egress
the other side,

causing the bullet to ricochet,

it'll scramble your
brains like an egg.

But this this .45
on the other hand,

well that's another
matter entire.

[slow suspenseful music]

Pop.
[guns firing]

[horses neighing]

Jesus.

Is everybody all right?

Yeah.

Found an arrowhead.

[Sully groaning]

It's a warrior.

The head will be barbed.

We can't pull it out.

Okay, then what
do you recommend?

Quit getting hit by arrows.

Noted.

Look, if we're
not able to pull,

we're gonna have to push.

You want something
to bite down on?

Just do it.

Ready.

[Sully breathing heavily]

[Sully groaning]

[mysterious music]

[crickets chirping]

They get deep?


When'd you get that?

To the victors
belong the spoils.

Uh uh.

How is he?

Lucky.

Is he gonna be able to ride?

I know I wouldn't but,

I mean he's Captain
by God Potter, so.

Captain Potter ain't
exactly Captain Potter lately.

I mean I know ain't
nobody asking me,

but that blonde haired
gal back in the world,

he's got his head
on back to front.

You're right.

No one's asking you.

Well, going on
fighting now anyways, so.

Yeah, till somebody comes along

and decides to stick their
spoon in our rabbit stew.

No, Grady's an old fuck.

He's an old fuck with a point.

I ain't got no stones to throw.

Captain's sleeping.

So should we.

I'll take the first watch.

How far to La Mojarra?

40 mile,

as the crow flies.

be some hard miles.

I just don't want
to get boxed in

'cause them Comanche
gonna treat us

like we're fish in a barrel.

You won't have to
worry about the Comanche.

The way to La Mojarra is cursed.

And they won't come near it.

To even speak its name is
considered bad medicine.

Darker things than the
Comanche live in those canyons.

Well,

sweet dreams.

[animal crying]

My grandmother
lived a hundred years

in these mountains.

She used to tell me that
was the cry of la Llorona,

the ghost of a long dead mother

looking for her lost children.

That's fascinating.

And your grandmother
lived to a hundred years

and she never heard
of a mountain lion.

Well. [chuckles]

There's not much room in your
world for wonder, is there?

If by wonder you mean
superstitious horse shit,

no, I expect not.

Do you ever go to
sleep with one arm

dangling over the
side of your bed?

And why not?

Deep in our hearts,

no matter how old we get,

we still know there are monsters

in the dark places of the world.

My ancestors just
called them gods.

Your ancestors probably
should have sent a few prayers

in some other directions too,

'cause when the end came,

it sure wasn't shiploads
of monsters what done it.

Was it not?

That look in your eye.

Yeah?

What look is that?

It's the look
of every white man

as if you own anything
you can stick a flag into,

as if it's your natural right
to fuck the whole world.

Not the whole world, cupcake.

Just certain dark
little crevices of it.

I'm a grieving widow.

I don't care.

Maybe that makes me a
wicked son of a bitch,

but you know what?

I don't really care
about that either.

You gonna fight me?

Would fighting stop you?

[mysterious music]

[Sully breathing heavily]

[disembodied screaming]
[Sully breathing heavily]

[Sully grunting]

[Lex grunting]

I will see you
buried for this.

You better find some
big fucking mariachis.

What the fuck is your problem?

What's wrong with me?

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Go back to your
tent, sleep it off.

[tense music]

You know, I'm getting
real sick of your shit.

What'd you say, sergeant?

I'm sorry.

I'm getting real sick
of your shit, sir.

You know,

I'm glad you got
a home sweet home

waiting for you
back in the world.

But I frankly don't
understand why the rest of us

have got to walk the
straight and narrow

just because you found Jesus

between some farm girls' thighs.

[fists thudding]

That's enough.

This ain't your fight, coward.

Wolf hound, my ass.

[suspenseful music]
[gun cocks]

I'm about to wolf
hound your ass.

I'm about to wear
you like a damn boot.

God damn.

That there,

that's the Cook I remember.

Now put that prissy little
thing back in its holster.

And the derringer too. [laughs]

[Sully groans]

I may have
misspoken when I said

you are all arrogant pups.

I may have misspoken
when I said we weren't.

Where are we?

It's only been a few hours.

We're still at camp.

Where were you?

On a farm.

What kind of farm?

Potatoes or some damn thing.

I might try that after the war.

See if I can

make something
live for a change.

I'm sorry for Lex.

So is his behavior
is unexpected then?

Out of character?

You travel with a
pack of rabid dogs

and apologize when they bite.

You think they
picked us for this

'cause we're heroes?

They picked us 'cause we ain't.

[soft music]

I know this treasure is
sacred to your people,

and legends about the gods,
that's a holy thing for you.

Me and Lex, we...

If there was a
righteous god in heaven

he never would've
made men like us.

[soft music]

Tell me more about this farm.

[ominous music]

That's interesting.

hell on navigation.

iron deposit in the rocks.


take the old Indian trails.

[slow suspenseful music]

[horse neighing]
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

[slow suspenseful music]

What is all this?

13th Calvary,

the final stand.

Looks like them Union fellas

beat us here after all.

Race ain't always to
a swift though, is it?

[slow suspenseful music]

They were firing
in all directions.

Looks like they shot
each other to pieces.

Let's scout ahead.

I don't want complications.

Then you're gonna hate this.

Keller.

How many?


[slow suspenseful music]

[door rumbling]
[dramatic music]

The Hell's Mouth.

Post a guard here
and call the others.

We're going in.

[slow suspenseful music]

So what now, oh
fearless leader?

What happened with the 13th?

We got to the door and
couldn't get through it.

Sun went down, the
creatures came.

Things come out to feed.

You got any plans
up your sleeve,

now's the time.

He's right.

Whatever we do, we
must do it quickly.

Under no circumstances
can we be in this place

when the sun sets.

That's less than an hour.

[creatures growling]

Here comes that
sinking feeling.

Should we evacuate?

I think I just did.

What are your orders, Captain?

Sully?
We should go, Captain.

It's just another dead end.

Door's open.

Yeah, with a full
hostile company inside,

plus whatever the hell did that.

Door like that's
worse than a wall.

He's right.

Staying out here's suicide.

We should get out of here.

I'm not going anywhere.

I've been down that path before.

I know where it leads.

And when the sun goes down
and those creatures come,

what do you plan to do then?

I plan on showing them
how a wolf can fight.

All right.

I guess we all get
to leave this world

the same way we came into it,

surrounded by large unknown
creatures and screaming.

got all that TNT?

Yeah.

Why?

If we can't pull,
we gotta push.

[ominous music]

[tense music]

[dramatic music]

Here, get these placed.

You can get down there and
get us to the third piece?

Okay.

All right.

Keller's riding blind.

He thinks we're dead and buried.

That and Dolorosa,
only advantages we got.

So we get in there,
we get the piece,

we run like hell.

Cook.

Cook.

You be out here.

You'll have your hand
on this detonator.

As soon as we're
out that cave mouth,

you blow it straight to hell.

You bring this whole
goddamn mountain down.

We'll show Keller what
buried looks like.

Captain, this only works
if we can outrun them.

He's right.

You'll slow us down.

And we're burning daylight.

Four of us go in.

[ominous music]

Hold the door.

[ominous music continues]

[eerie music]

They went the wrong way.

Follow me.

Smells like a damn tomb.

[eerie music]

[bat squeaking]

[ominous music]

[intense music]

Fucking eureka.

Well, well, well.

You ever get the
feeling of deja vu?

Didn't you just say that?

I'm surprised to see you here.

Well, I'm surprised
you're surprised.

Long dark tunnels are
right up my alley.

Then we'll just bury
you deeper this time.

[ominous music]
[creatures snarling]

I believe that's my exit music,

final bow for the rest of you.

If the ruins are to be believed,

I'm afraid this
amulet's the only thing

that can keep one safe

from the curse of
the Aztec gold.

Wonder how it fares
against Kentucky led?

[gun cocks]

[gun firing]

[shot echoing]
[body thudding]

[guns firing]

[creatures screeching]
[dramatic music]

Get behind me.

What the hell are you doing?

Something stupid.

[dramatic music]

Well, there's your creatures.

Damn Indian trick.

War cry have us
jumping at shadows.

Let's get the
fuck out of here.

Where's the woman?


What happened?

Do it.
Where are the others?

They're dead.

What happened?

They're dead.

Those [indistinct] are coming.

They're coming.

Here.

Go.

Go!

[slow suspenseful music]

No!

[bomb booming]

[rocks thudding]

[kettle whistling]

Welcome.

[ominous music]

What's your name, little one?

Goldie.

Well, of course it is.

Yep.

What else would King
Midas call his daughter?

You don't need to be
scared of us, Goldilocks.

Yeah, your pappy and
us, we go way back.

We're thick as
thieves, you might say.

Just keep them hands
flat on the table

for me there, Captain.

You know, we used to work
together down in Mexico way

doing, well, I don't even
know what you'd call it.

House cleaning, maybe.

How'd you find this
place without the map?

We didn't need
to find the map.

We just needed to find you.

It's like you say, Captain,

some assholes are hard to miss.

Military type, heading out
of Monroe six years ago,

blonde haired lass in tow.

Some trails are too cold.

Some are too hot.

Finally we found us one.

It was just right.

[ominous music]

I swear to God,
I thought you died.

Well, we did.

Yeah.

We actually dug ourselves
out of that hell

when you left us in,

we got picked up at the border.

Federales threw
us in this little

five by five hole,

and buried in the
waters of baptism,

now raised to walk
in newness of life.

There's no gold here.

The serpent god's treasure,

you can see that.

Just look outside.

There's nothing out there
but damn wheat fields.

Miles of caves underneath.

I dug for weeks.

Well, you're gonna dig
just a little bit more.

You're gonna walk out
in that moonlight,

just as naked as the
day you were born.

You're gonna dig three graves.

Please.

Please. [cries]

[dramatic music]

You're all three going into
the ground tonight, Captain.

Now, whether they get
it quick and painless,

or real slow, like you,

that's your call.

But you've scattered your
seed among the thorns

and tonight you're
gonna reap it.

You're gonna reap it in spades.

You do what you want to to me,

you leave my family out of this.

Hurting them, that ain't fair.

You buried the
three of us alive.

Cook, I didn't know you-

You buried us alive!

Now we're gonna bury you.

Couldn't get more fair.

Fucking circular.

[slow suspenseful music]

Did you kill my dog?

[Lex snickers]

That dog ain't the
only bitch of yours

we're gonna be
putting down tonight.

[dramatic music]

[tense music]

[gun fires]
[Lex yelling]

[dramatic music]
[fists thudding]

[kid crying]

[gun firing]

Come on, come on.

No.

[hand slapping]

[glass shattering]

[slow suspenseful music]

[gun cocks]

You're right
about them monsters

under your bed, Goldilocks.

You're not the
monster I heard.

[ominous music]

[monster snarling]

[Lex screaming]

[dramatic music]

[monster growling]

Told you.
