My goals are to excel

in my field of study
and become the best...

no, the greatest,

no, no, the best.

To excel and become the best...

<i>The best at...</i>

<i>I don't know,
that doesn't sound right.</i>

<i>To excel and become...</i>

<i>A viable asset to my family</i>

<i>and the community.</i>

<i>Ah, is that lame?</i>

All right,
listen up, here it is!

This one here.

I'm looking for
what is the value

of a times b in this equation.

This is a good one, who wants to
take a crack at this bad boy?

Someone other than Alex?

Chris!

What do you think?

Eh...

I don't know, eight?

No, no, not eight.

I'm looking for 12 team, 12.

Okay?
This is not rocket science.

Yet.

Okay Alex.

Tell us what we're all missing.

Well, if you want
the value to be 12,

then I think you'd have to
change the exponent from 1/4

to 1/2.

You are correct.

Very good.
Score one more for Alex.

Ok, that's it,

have a great weekend!

You may want to open your books,

you'll find some
amazing things inside.

Letters and numbers.

I'm should be there at six.
Oh really?

Yeah, I may just take the bus.

Hey Alex,
can I have a word with you?

Yeah sure, I'll catch up
with you right now.

Yup.

I've been hearing
some good things.

Very good things indeed Alex.

Wow, that's... that's awesome.

Thanks Mr. Tillison,
to be honest,

I was getting kinda worried.

What?

What are you worried about?
You've got the goods.

You're the kind of kid
they're looking for.

You have nothing to worry about.

I don't know how
you manage to resist the urge

to do some of that stupid stuff
Mike was talking about.

You know, the stuff
that kids our age do.

Yeah I guess some of it
is fun, right?

Some of it
is pretty stupid though.

Like, I've heard of these kids

were drinking hand sanitizer
because of the alcohol content.

That is definitely not bright.

You're gonna go do
those runs for your ma'?

Yeah, mhm.

She must be proud of you, huh?

Yeah, I guess so.

What do you mean you guess?

Yes, she's proud.

I mean,

she didn't really
graduate high school,

so I'd be the first one in the
family to go to college.

Oh.

Well, what are you doing later?
Me and Marcy

are going to the mall.

Ah, cool, cool. Well, I'll shoot
you a call then?

Alright.
Bye

and my goal is to pursue
<i>the dual majors of math</i>

<i>and physics.</i>

<i>- My...
Where are you going homeboy?</i>

I don't want any problems man.
Who said anything about problems?

We're just talking,
you know what I'm saying?

So where are you headed to,
church boy?

I'm just going home, man.

I like your bike.

Yeah, I like it too. -Oh so,
you're a smart ass, huh?

I never did like your punk ass.

What's up Alex?
Hey.

Stop messing with him, man.

I said let it go.

Keep hitting them books, Alex.

Why are you always backing
that chump up, dog?

Because he's smart,
unlike your dumb ass.

<i>I've been in love with
mathematics since I was a child.</i>

<i>My dad gave me an abacus
for a birthday present</i>

<i>when I was four.</i>

<i>And ever since then...</i>

<i>I intend to dedicate my time...</i>

<i>intellect and energy
to the pursuit of um...</i>

<i>The pursuit of what? Of...</i>

<i>The pursuit of uh...</i>

Mom, what is she saying?

She wants to pair you up
with her niece.

Oh.

Um...

Well, I dropped the gowns off
at Ms. Mendoza's.

Can I get 20 bucks?

For a book, I need a book.

Another book?

Yeah mom, another book.
I like books.

Thanks.
And now go.

Go okay? Because
I have lots of work to do.

Okay.

I know, that was so cool.

I know...

Shit, I have to go.
Flora.

Flora open the door.

Flora open the damn door!

What are you doing?

You know? I pride myself
a pretty smart guy.

But when it comes to you, these
days

I have no clue
what you're doing.

You know?
We don't ask you to do much!

The day you make your own money
is when you call your own shots!

But until then
you're under my roof!

This is the ultimate low!

He's just telling me to do...
Look at it!

Shores, to pick up
after my brother, to pick up...

Go on, look at it!
To be home by 11...

You chose...

<i>God, he is so annoying,
I just hate hearing his voice.</i>

To put the
family's private affairs online

so everybody can comment on it!

He never listens to me,
he just tells me

to do stupid shit!

You don't have any idea
how serious this is, do you?

I'm talking to you, flora!

I hear you, I hear you.

Well, then say something.
I ain't got nothing to say.

That's the best you can do?

We've given you
everything you want.

And you thank us by putting
this crap

on the Internet.

I don't understand you.

Yeah, I know, you don't

and the drugs.

If I catch you coming home
wasted,

one more time...

You're grounded flora.

Have fun spending the next
few days without these.

Hey.
Hey.

Got anything else?
I'm ready to party.

Uh!
Are we ready for this?

Yeah - let's do this thing.

His ways are not our ways.

His thoughts are not our
thoughts.

But as the heavens are above us

his wisdom is high.

And his will at the end is
always

full of goodness and grace.

Joseph, the son of Jacob
in the old testament reading,

had to suffer for a long time

as a slave in a foreign land.

He had to wait for god to decide for
him to be the second man of Egypt.

He had to wait

to understand.

His wisdom.

At times,

we can only discover and
appreciate

his boundless wisdom and love

through the gift of hindsight.

This is the word of the lord.

Amen.

Hey

good to see you again.

Hey, how is it going?
Good, good.

How many did we serve today?

168. I'll double check though,
if you want.

Wow, we just keep getting

more and more people
every week, don't we?

Yeah.

We're going to have to ask god
to figure out

how to expand this program,
I think.

So, how's the college hunt
going?

So far so good. Yeah.

I'm just waiting on my letter to
confirm my interview to Cal tech.

That's really fantastic.
Yeah.

Cal tech would be be
a great school for you.

I mean, it should have
been here by now, but...

I'm just going to...
Oh come on, be patient.

Your dad would be very proud
of you.

I know your mom is.
Yeah, I think she is.

Well, if you need anything more
from me, you know,

like another letter of
recommendation.

Anything.
Thanks father.

I think this looks good.

Mrs. Rosa,

oh my goodness.

This is so beautiful,
I don't even know what to say.

Oh, you're welcome.

Thank you, thank you so much.

You and Alex are going to
look just perfect.

You need to look good for your
prom.

But maybe fix this a little bit.

There, so it doesn't fall off.

Mom, guys. Guys it came!

Hey knock.
I'm sorry.

There's a young lady
getting undress here.

I'm sorry. I'm just a little
excited.

It came.
Ok, now you could look.

The letter. It came,
the interview letter, I got it.

Oh, that took forever.

It did.

I wasn't that nervous...

You were too, you were
terrified.

Ok.

All right, I was slightly
terrified.

That's it.

Wow, Cal tech.

You're gonna be...
You're gonna be really busy.

I probably won't even see
you much once you enroll.

No, not at all,

I'm sure I'll be down every
weekend.

It's a big week for you next
week.

Yes it is.

I'm looking forward to every
minute of it.

I know you are.

My dad should be here for this,
you know?

He was just a poor
construction worker.

He worked so hard
for everything that he had.

I want to be more like him,
you know?

It would be great
if he was here, that's all.

Hey.

He is here, Alex.

That's my sister.

Alright.
Ok.

I'll talk to you later, all right?
Yeah.

Congrats again.
Thanks.

Ok, ok.

Damn it Lacey!

This better not be...
Raj, what's up bro?

Hi.

What are you doing in Denver?

Just came to camp out for
a few days on our way to L.A.

What?

Yeah, you heard me.
Me and the crew

stopped here to pay you
a visit. It is ok, right?

Let me talk to you a minute.
I'll be right back.

This is nuts.

Man, I'm so hungry.
Me too and I have to pee.

I'm so fucking exhausted. -God,
hype better not fuck this up.

This is complete bull shit.

Alright look, we are allowed
here for a few days

but I mean,
we got to keep quiet.

They got a new kid and...
Fuck that, I've got to pee.

I'm hungry.

I'm hungry too.

<i>This I believe is
an opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

<i>And I intend to make
the most of it.</i>

And finally
I'd like to state that my

academic interests
are foremost in my mind.

My desire is to dedicate
everything I have

to the pursuit of a doctorate
in the field of physics.

Thank you.

It was a very impressive
presentation Mr. Reyes.

Thank you sir.

Do you have any more
questions for Mr. Reyes?

I have a couple of questions.

Your father's occupation is...

He's deceased.

He was in um... development.

Construction.

Architecture.
I see.

Sorry for your loss,
and your mother?

She's in the fashion industry.

Thank you.

Mr. Reyes! Mr. Reyes!

Mr. Reyes.

Mr. Reyes. I am so glad
I caught up with you.

Is there a problem?
No, no problem.

We just need one more thing
for your application.

Okay, what's that?

Proof of U.S. citizenship,

a birth certificate, a passport?

Either one.

Eh, ok, I'll get that to you.

Yes, just send me an email

and by the way,
you did great in there.

It's looking really good.

I have to go.
Ok.

It went well.

I am so proud of you.

I know.

This is supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.

Mom, they want us
to get proof of citizenship.

They need to see a birth
certificate.

Do I have one?

Because I've never seen it.

I knew this day would come.

What day mom?
What are you talking about?

Your father and I,

we brought you when you were
just a couple of months old.

Alex, I prayed for you everyday.

I prayed that this
won't get in your way.

Don't cry mom, please.

English mom, English.

His company, they were
going to sponsor him and us.

And then he just died so
suddenly

and it just never happened.

It's going to be alright mom.

I'll think of something.

A birth certificate?

Mom...

I'll get around all of it, ok?

It's just frustrating when you
think one thing the entire time...

Calm down.
I'm calm, aren't I?

Look, this birth certificate
issue

could become a major roadblock.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

Immigration,

being undocumented,
birth certificates

it's all I've thought about
for the past 24 hours now.

I just assumed that I was born
here.

Now finding out
that none of us are legal.

We're going to have to
figure out your options.

They're offering me a full ride.

I told them that my father
was an architectural engineer.

That my mom was a...

Designer in the fashion
industry. You know my parents.

I do.

And your father was a proud
construction worker

who loved you.

And Rosa, your mom is a...

Proud seamstress?

I was going to say "Saint".

I lied about who my parents are.

That's how bad that I wanted
this thing.

Don't ever do that again.

Ok?

Yes sir.

Hi.

Do you guys have any
spare change?

We're just trying
to get some food.

Thank you so much.
Thank you, have a good one.

How come they keep
giving you money?

Girl, it's the innocent face.

Alright, let's call it a day,
I'm tired

alright.

God, I hate this begging shit.

It's what we gotta do?

I'm just saying, it was a lot
easier when I was back home.

Duh!

I like you flora.
How old are you?

18 April third.

No shit, really?

I thought you were like 20 or
21.

Not yet.

What about you Gloria?
I just turned 23.

How long have you been living
in Venice beach?

Just a year.

It's alright most of the time.

Before that I was in east L.A.

But I'm from a small town
outside Jalisco, Mexico.

I have never been to Mexico.

I wish I could go sometimes.

I really miss
my grandmother's cooking.

It sounds like an adventure.

We've got an adventure right
here.

I don't know.

Sure, California it's warm
and the beaches are beautiful

but we're not doing anything.

What is there to do

I mean, we hang,
we party, we get loaded.

That's what we do.

I don't know.

Yo.

Where's all the food?

We need more supplies,
we're running short.

No shit, anybody got any money?

No.

No, we're broke.

Get more beer

lots of beer.

My sister says she will gladly
drive us wherever we want to go.

It's prom night,
she knows what that means.

And she thinks you're cool.

She does?

Yes silly.

We like smart guys over here.

So, I guess I'll be seeing you
at 7:00 tonight?

Yeah, I just have to pick up
your corsage and I'll be there.

Ok, great.

We're going to look so cool.

Yeah, I can't wait.

Alright, see you tonight.

What's up Alex?

It's my bike man, someone took
it.

What happened?

I went in the house for 2
seconds and my bike got jacked.

I don't know man, I wasn't gone
for more than five seconds.

We'll get your bike back.

You think so? You can do that?

Maybe.

I need to ask you a favor, man.

I'm supposed to pick up
a corsage at the flower shop

down on central, before they
close.

I was going to take the bike,
but...

Corsage?
Yeah, tonight's my prom.

Oh yeah, prom night.

Yeah man, you should've
told me. Come on in.

Thanks, I'll be right back.

Got it.
Alright, you ready?

Yeah man.
I appreciate this so much.

Don't worry about it.

How's your mom?

She's good.

She must be really proud of you.

Everybody keeps saying that, man
I...

I'm just trying to make,
the best of myself, you know?

Give me a second. Hello?

What's up dawg?

Yeah actually, you know what?
I'm pretty close.

Ah okay. Yeah, don't trip.

Yeah, that's cool.

Hey um, I'm going to make
a quick pit stop.

It's on the way.
Yeah, no problem.

Alright.

I'll be right back.
Alright.

Sorry for the delay, dawg.
That's all good.

I'll get you back home
in no time, just a few minutes.

Why do you think those guys
always pick on me, man?

You know what?
You know what it is?

I think they're jealous of you,
Alex.

I think they're envious.

I think they hate what they
can't be, you know what I mean?

Maybe they wish they were
as smart as you.

Deep inside, you know?

It just sucks, man.
Yeah, you know.

It's part of growing up.

Oh shit.

That's all? Check this.

Let's go.

Detective, I promise.
I had no idea about any drugs.

I was getting a ride
to the florist for prom and...

and that's it. -We've been
through that already Mr. Reyes.

The fact is that the car

you were driving
contained drugs.

Okay? And that makes you
an accessory.

I'm sorry to say.

I was just getting a lift.

Yeah, so you say.

Actually your buddy, Jose.

Jose Quintero, right?

He backs up your story.

He said that you had no knowledge
of the drugs and that they were his

and that he was giving you
a ride to the flower shop.

It appears that we have

a bit of a problem
in our hands Mr. Reyes.

See, you're not showing up
in any of our data bases.

Is almost as if you don't exist.

On paper, anyways.

They, that can't be right, eh...

What does that mean?

That means we're going to be holding
you over for immigration services.

What? That's not fair.

Yeah, I'm sorry kid. You won't
be getting out tonight.

Gloria Hernandez.

Gloria Hernandez.

That's you right?
Yeah, that's me.

Up!

Am I getting out?

This way.
Where are we going?

This officer is from
immigration.

Immigration? -You're now
remanded to their custody.

Have a good day.
No, there has been a mistake.

You're Gloria Hernandez, right?

Wait, wait, there has just been
a huge mix-up.

Come on, let's go.
There is a huge mistake.

Have a good day.
Come on, let's go.

No, please.

Hello.

Alex?

Slow down Alex,
just slow down, slow down.

Tell me that again.

<i>I was arrested
for possession of drugs.</i>

I was just getting a ride
from this guy that I know.

<i>I had no idea about
any drugs, I swear to you.</i>

I believe you.

They're give me
to immigration services today.

I don't know what to do.
Father, I'm scared.

<i>We're going to get through
this together, okay?</i>

Please let my mom know
that I'm alright.

And I'll see her soon.

I hope.

You will

<i>you will see her soon,
I promise you that.</i>

Don't let her come see me
either, because...

well they could take her too.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.

Thank you father.

Sit down.

Listen to me.

We're trying to help you,

we want what's going to work out
best for both of us.

Read the form before you sign
it.

You can read it, right?

No, I'm not going to sign this.

I can't voluntarily deport
myself, there's no way.

You don't have a choice!

You were caught with a substantial
quantity of narcotics.

I keep telling you guys,
they were not mine!

You were in the car with drugs!

They may as well
have been in your pockets.

Listen, we don't have a lot of
time to screw around with this.

You're either going to be
incarcerated here,

or walk free in Mexico.

Your home.

This is my home.

Not anymore pal.

I want a lawyer then.

You want a trial?

We're gonna you a speedy one.
Get him out of here.

Here your honor.
Thank you Julie.

Excuse me.

Are Mr. James Epian?
Yes sir.

Sir, I'm father Roberts... -You're
gonna need to step behind...

I understand that, I was told to talk
to you in regards of Alejandro Reyes.

He had a 2:00 hearing.
I'm sorry, you're late.

He has been deported.

He's been what?

Mr. James, please take your
conversation out into the hall.

Yes, your honor.
Let's step outside.

Alejandro Reyes

had a 2:00 hearing.

That's 40 minutes from now.

So, let me get this straight.
You're telling me that

for some unexplainable reason
his hearing got moved up?

And for some
other unexplainable reason

he is now on
a deportation bus to Mexico?

Do I have that right?

That is correct.

That's all you have to say?

Mr. James,
how the hell did this happen?

Shit happens, padre.

Our docket's overbooked.

Work load is crazy. There's...

Too few people here
doing too many things.

So?

So, sometimes things
slip through the cracks.

Which is what happened
with your Mr. Reyes.

Sorry, we're not dealing
with the perfect system here.

Slipped through the cracks?

Ok, the fact remains, this kid,
this very good, very loving kid

is right now on a bus to Mexico.

A country he's never been to,
by the way.

Without having any due process,
without having a lawyer!

You're the a.D.A. Mr. James! What the
hell are you going to do about it?

I'm going to go back into that
court room and do my job.

Sorry about the screw up, padre.

Don't you walk away from me.
Get your hands off me.

You don't want
an assault charge, do you?

Look, getting mad at me is not
going to solve your problem.

You have a lawyer?

Yes, we do now.

Well I suggest you file an
appeal.

We will.
Well good luck with that.

Look father, your job is saving
souls.

Mine is deporting people.

So far I think I'm winning on
points.

And by the way, this was a drug
case.

Your guy got off easy.

Yeah, I'll pray for your soul
Mr. James!

Have a nice day!

Watch your step.

<i>Hi, you know what to do...</i>

Hype, call me back,
I'm in fucking Mexico

and this shit is not cool!

Hey, my name is Alex.

We were on the
same bus together.

Lucky you.

I just heard you speaking
English.

It was nice to hear,
my Spanish is horrible.

Yeah, so is mine.

Well, what's your name?

My name is Gloria, what's up?

What are you doing down here?

It's a long story,
and I'd love to tell you

but I'm trying to get up out of
here.

So, bye.

Eh...

Alex Reyes.

Alex Reyes.

I'm sorry, I don't speak
Spanish.

Okay.

The dormitory is at the end.

We serve two meals for three
days.

After three days, you're on
your own.

You cannot stay here.

I don't speak...

Hey, how's it going?

Oh just wonderful. How
do you think I'm doing?

Stuck here in hell.
Woah.

It's a question, alright?

Forget it.

Wait.

It's just been a rough day.

What's up?

Not much.

I'm just going to get some money
exchanged so I can call my mom.

What about you?

My friends are coming for me,
though.

That's great.

I'm not worried.

Okay, maybe I'll see you later
then.

What?
That guy, he...

is making trouble to you?

Oh no.

Good.

What's your name.

Glo.
Glo?

Beautiful name Glo.

Hey.

You wanna go hang out
with my friends?

Sure.

Come on mom, pick up.

Come on, pick up mom.

Mom, it's me.

I'm in Mexico. I'm ok though.

Don't worry, ok?

Hello? Hello?

<i>- Mom?
Alex!</i>

Alex, how are you?

I'm ok.

Where are you Alex?

<i>I'm staying in a shelter.</i>

A shelter?
I'm alright, ok?

No mom, not at all.

I want you to go
and stay with my sister.

Your sister?

Your Tia Perlita.
Remember I told you about her?

She lives in Juarez, I want you
to go and stay with her.

No, I should be ok here.
No, no.

You won't be ok, I want you to
go and stay with Tia Perla...

Mom, a bus ride to Juarez...

It's a long way.

I don't have much money, so...

I'll send you the money.
<i>I'll send you her address</i>

and the money in western union,
<i>ok?</i>

It will make me feel much
better.

Stop worrying about me, ok?
I can take care of myself.

I miss you so much.

I want you to let
father Roberts and the attorney

take care of everything.

Alright?

Just stay out of it
as much as possible, ok?

I love you too.

Thank you.-

<i>this is the worst place
in the world, it's horrible.</i>

Father, I'm loosing it out here.

I understand son.

No, I don't think you do, okay?

You're not the one getting jumped out
here in the middle of the street.

I'm...

I'm sorry.

<i>I've got a top notch immigration
attorney</i> working on this.

He's a...
He feels pretty good about it.

<i>A lot of grandstanding</i>

but again, he feels confident.

Father, there's something else.

<i>I'm going to need a couple of
bucks</i>

<i>to go to my aunt's house
in Juarez.</i>

<i>Of course.
I'll send you some tonight.</i>

Thank you father.

I got to ask, what
the hell are you doing here?

It's kind of a long story.
Aren't they all?

Did you get into a fight there Rambo?
It wasn't much of a fight.

They got me coming out
of the western union building.

It figures.

They spot you guys a mile away,
huh?

You're lucky they just took
your money.

So, tell me Marron.
My name is Alex,

so, tell me Alex.

What are you going to do?

I think I'm going to stay with my
mom's sister in Juarez, but...

Juarez? No cabron.
That's even worse.

When you're down here in Mexico,

you have to be extra careful
to everything you do here.

Unfortunately it's being overrun
right now by

evil dangerous people who will kill you
just for stepping on their shadow.

And they're not fucking around.
Listen,

I've seen kids from the states
come down here and get stuck

chewed up, spit out in a matter
of days.

Be very careful Alex.
I will.

Hi, is Perla Ortiz, does she
live here?

I'm looking for my aunt Perla
Ortiz.

She moved out.

So, do you know where she lives
now?

Thank you.

I was just visiting my aunt.

That's all I have.

I don't understand what you're
saying.

I was just in Juarez to visit
my aunt.

Excuse me, can I stay here
tonight?

We're all filled up tonight,
man.

I don't have any
other place to go, though.

Lo siento Marron, but that's how
it is tonight, can't help you man.

Mira, come back tomorrow.

I'll see what we can do, but
I'm not making any promises.

Ok?

Thank you sir.
Rudy.

Call me Rudy.

What?

Hey, you didn't
come to kill us, did you?

No.

Get in man, it's cold here.
Come on, sit down.

Sit down, sit down.

Good you don't come to kill us
because I'm just too tired

to deal with life and the
struggles tonight, yeah.

But I had to ask you, you know?

Yeah.

Here, this will take the chill
down.

So,

did you get lost or something?

I guess you could say that.

Relax, huh? We don't get
too many visitors here.

Yeah.

We were just talking about
going across the border.

Just to kill a vato.

Let me guess, you're hungry,
huh?

Thank you.

So, Alex.

How the hell did you end up
down here with us?

I was on my way to my senior
prom,

next thing you know
I'm getting deported.

Well,

being deported

is a peach.

I know about that first hand.

I just got to get back home.

I've been across three times.

Three times, really?

I crossed over in a train once.

In a train? How?

The trains that go out of
Nogales,

they've got these sleeve-like
things,

in the undercarriage, right?

A man can squeeze himself
into that thing.

And take a 35-mile ride
into the U.S.A.

Woosh.

Is it dangerous?

Is it dangerous?

Damn right it's dangerous.

If you slip, just one tiny
little bit.

You can...

You can kiss your ass goodbye.

I wouldn't recommend it.

I don't even look
like the same guy anymore.

That's because you're a
different guy.

No, I don't drink.

I think you're doing a lot
of things you never did before.

Come on.

Welcome to the club, kid.

Hey.

Thanks for being...

Just friendly and nice.

Why not?

All the rough.

This world's a rough place.

No need for everyone
to be an asshole.

You should get some rest, kid.

You've got lot ahead of you.

I used to work in a kitchen
in California.

Yeah, yeah, what else?
Well, you're shorthanded

I can help out where you need
it.

I don't have any money,
I cannot pay you.

I just need a place to crash
for a few more days.

It's free labor,
I'll help out both meals

take some pressure off of you.

I don't have to be on the count

I'll sleep in the closet
if that's what you need.

Ok, look, we'll talk later.

Ok?
Ok, I'll be back.

Oh, I know you will.

So, you're still here?

It looks like it.

So are you.
Yeah.

Hey, what happened to you?
Why are you judging me?

No, I'm not. I was just...

What do you or anybody else
care about what happens to me?

Look, I'm sorry ok?
If you think I offended you,

but I care alright? I do care.

You like me,
we don't belong in this place.

We could die at any minute and
no one

this side of the border
would give a damn, ok?

Look I got jumped last time that
I saw you.

Alright?

I just thought that maybe...

We watch each other's back so...

How are you going to watch my
back?

You can't even
look after yourself.

I'm just saying...
Look.

I don't need you or anybody
else worrying about me.

I can take care of myself.

Thank you.

Save your breath, Marron.

A girl like her,

she has all the answers.

You know?

I've seen it over and over
before.

Worry about yourself. Worry
about yourself.

Alright.

We're at the court house now.

So how does it look?

The president signed
a new executive order

<i>we got a petition, we've got
your academic records,</i>

<i>we got the letter
of intent from Cal tech.</i>

So how soon do we think?

I don't know kid.

<i>The government is really
playing hard ball here.</i>

They uh, they seem to think you're
some kind of a career criminal

they're acting like we're crazy
cuz we're standing up for you.

I just don't know what to do.

<i>Look, just know that we are
doing</i>

everything that we possibly can
to bring you home.

I know, I know.

Look, Paul Tillison is here
speaking on your behalf,

he'd like to...
He'd like to talk to you.

Ok?

Here he is.
<i>- Hey Alex.</i>

<i>So sorry this is happening to
you.</i>

You, I just want you to know
that we're all pulling for you.

The petition has almost
400 names on it so far, so...

That's great.

Yeah, uh...
You know, don't give up.

Hang in there.

Welcome home. Next!

Hi, I came down here with a couple
friends last week to party and...

We got separated and they ended
up coming back without me.

People that I was staying with
stole my wallet or something

so I don't even have my ID on
me, but I live in Los Angeles

and I'm gonna graduate
in a couple of weeks or so...

What's your name?
Alex Reyes.

I thought you had crossed
back over or something,

not yet.

I'm working on it, though.

Man you...

you look like you've been...

through it, huh?

Yeah, I have.

I tried to cross and ended up
in the detention center.

I was able to take a couple
showers,

toothpaste and deodorant.

The one thing that...

food here at the shelter
is way better than over there.

I find that hard to believe,
huh?

No, seriously.

Do you think that I may
be able to work in the kitchen?

Sure, why not. Come on in.

Now don't touch anything, I know
where everything is at, ok?

Ok.

You can sleep over there.

Thanks Rudy, I appreciate this.

No problem, kid.

Oh, you know that girl you were
having the argument with?

We're not arguing.

No cabron,
you were arguing. Anyway

she's been staying at the
shelter for the past few nights.

Really?

I think Mexico is beginning
to wear her ass out.

That's not good.

The kitchen opens in two hours.

Yeah, I'll be there.

Hey Rudy.
Yeah.

How do you speak English so
well?

I'm from Tijuana, cabron.

Take that and bring some
tortillas.

Take that and come back soon.

You did alright today, huh?

Everything moved just perfect.

Eh, and the line...

the line moved fast.
You were right.

Oh no.

Oh...

I think that was the first cigarette
I've had since I was like 12.

Ah?

My mom caught me,
she made me eat it.

What?

Yeah, it was disgusting.

Oh cabron, my mother

my mother would give me
cigarettes

so she wouldn't have
to smoke alone.

She did?

She was like that, you know?
Oh man.

And then,

with the Tequila shots.

No...

That's too much.

I think that's the first time
I've laughed in 2 weeks.

I just hope I don't get stuck
here forever, you know?

You won't.

Good morning.
Oh, hi.

So we're both still here.
It looks that way.

Talk to you later.
Yeah.

Got you some water.
Thanks.

Hey...

I'm sorry about the other night,

I didn't mean to bother you.

That's alright.

I thought you were working on a
scheme to get you back home.

No.

No, I...

Tried to cross the border,

they didn't buy it.

Bummer.

Yeah.

How about you? And your people?

No.

What are you going to do?

I don't know.

What are you going to do?
Something.

I've got to get out of here.

Your folks miss you, huh?

My mom does.

My dad passed away
when I was pretty small.

It's been me and my mom
for a while.

And you?
I bet your family misses you.

I don't know, I guess.

Can we talk about something else

yeah, sure.

I didn't mean to pry.

Alex, we need to set up for
dinner.

Are you going
to stay here tonight?

Okay.

I better get back to work, ok?

<i>You have reached</i>

<i>father Roberts' voicemail</i>

<i>he's not available
to take your call right now</i>

<i>please leave a message</i>

<i>and he'll return your call
as soon as possible.</i>

I want you to go inside
and meet this guy.

I don't want to go inside.

I take care of you
all this time, now go inside!

Nogales is another one of those
puertas that is out of control.

The cartel has got
that place by the huevos.

There is a lot of killing
going on over there.

I'm not going down there
to mess up with the cartel

i...
You asked for my advice.

I think your scheme is crazy
and is going to get you killed.

If that's what you have to do...

Eh?

Think about it very carefully
before you jump.

Hey Rudy.

Can I get one more cigarette?

You should've killed me.

I'm so sorry.

It's my fault.

No.

This is all my fault.

My name's not Gloria.

It's flora.

I was born in Missouri.

I'm an American citizen.

Why?

You're really a citizen?

I just want to go home.

I just really,
really want to go home.

Please, I just want to go home. I
just really, really want to go home.

Let's get you home.

<i>- Hello?
Mr. Hendrix?</i>

<i>- Flora's father?
Yes, who's this?</i>

<i>My name is Alex, I'm calling
you from Tijuana, Mexico.</i>
