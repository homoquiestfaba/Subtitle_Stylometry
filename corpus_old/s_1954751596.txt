At that age,

I was almost too
short to look outside.

Through one of my
windows, all I could see

was a cloud, an ocean of ash.

It suffocated everything.

Out the other window, I
saw the people in town.

Out both, I saw darkness.

Dad had always said,
the job of dam keeper

is to keep the darkness away.

But by then, I was
doing it alone.

I was the dam keeper.

Ugh.

Ugh.

Dad had always

said the job of a dam keeper
is to keep the darkness away.

But he never told me what
to do when it surrounds you.

His mask protected
me from the cloud.

But nothing I had protected
me from the people.
