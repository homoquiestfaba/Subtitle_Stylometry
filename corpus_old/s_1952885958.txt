Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!

Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.

Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.

What's Twilight doing?
She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.

Where are the others? It's getting late.

Hold your horses, girl. We're here.

Perfect! I'm ready.

For what?

All right, Spike.

An apple! Are we having pie?

Shh! Watch!

*Oh! Wow! Lovely!*

Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Yes.

Will they be safe, Twilight?

You have my word.

Ta-da!

Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.

Opalescence, no!

Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?

What ever shall we do?

Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?

Oh. Yeah. Right.

Come on, you guys. Let me in!

Sure thing, Spike.

Heavens no! We're getting dressed.

Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.

I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.

I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our home town, Twilight!

And best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!

Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.

We'll just have to see.

We're gonna be a mite busy.

Busy having fun!

Oh. Okay.

Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.

Great!

Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels. And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.

Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Excuse me?

Um... I...
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Huh.

Wow!

You all look... amazing!

I can't believe we're finally here! With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this the best night ever!

At the Gala (at the Gala)

At the Gala, in the garden

I'm going to see them all

all the creatures, I'll befriend them at the Gala! (at the Gala)

All the birdies and the critters

They will love me big and small

We'll become good friends forever

Right here at the Gala!
(All our dreams will come true right here at the Gala, at the Gala!)

At the Gala (it's amazing), I will sell them (better hurry)

All my appletastic treats (yummy, yummy)

Hungry ponies (they'll be snacking), they will buy them (bringing money)

Caramel apples, apple sweets! (gimme some)

And I'll earn a lot of money for the Apple family!
(All our dreams and our hopes from now until hereafter)

(All that we've been wishing for will happen at the Gala, at the Gala!)

At the Gala, all the royals

They will meet fair Rarity

They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala! (at the Gala)

I will find him, my Prince Charming,

and how gallant he will be,

he will treat me like a lady, tonight at the Gala!
(This is what we've waited for, to have the best night ever)

(Each of us will live our dreams, tonight at the Gala, at the Gala!)

I've been dreaming, I've been waiting

To fly with those brave ponies

The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks

Spinning 'round and having kicks

Perform for crowds of thousands

They'll shower us with diamonds

The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala!
(All we've come for, all we've dreamed, our happy ever after)

(Finally they'll all come true, right here at the Grand Gala, at the Gala!)

I am here at the Grand Gala, for it is the best party

But the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie

For I am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree

Ponies playing, ponies dancing, with me at the Grand Gala!
(Happiness and laughter at the Gala, at the Gala!)

At the gala (at the gala), with the princess (with the princess)

Is where I'm going to be (she will be)

We will talk all about magic and what I've learned and seen (she will see)

It is going to be so special as she takes time just for me!
(This will be the best night ever!)

(Into the Gala we must go, we're ready now, we're all aglow)

(Into the Gala, let's go in and have the best night ever)

(Into the Gala, now's the time, we're ready and we look divine)

(Into the Gala) meet new friends

(Into the Gala) sell some apples

(Into the Gala) find my prince

(Prove I'm great) as a Wonderbolt is

To meet

To sell

To find

To prove

To whoop

To talk

(Into the Gala, into the Gala!) x2

(And we'll have the best night ever!)

(At the Gala!)

Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever. You know why?

Cause we're all gonna spend time at the Gala to--

--gether. Or not.

Princess Celestia!

Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.

Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.

Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.

That's just what I was hoping you'd say.

Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... WAIT!

Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined!

Even better than I imagined.

Oh my! A meadowlark!

I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for!

Howdy, partner! You hungry?

As a horse!

Well, what's you're hungering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?

I'll take that big apple pie!

Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yeehaw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soaren?

Heh. Yeah!

My pie!

You saved it! Thanks...

Hey, no prob.

Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale in one The Best Flyer Competition.

Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.

Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, at least they saved Soaren's apple pie.

Wanna come hang out with us?
Sure! Why not?

I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!

The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!

Gotta dance!

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala x2

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!

It's all I ever dreamed! x2
Youhou!

It's all I ever dreamed!
Yippee!

I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!

It's all I've ever... dreamed?

Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood.

I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
You mean... this rose?

Thank you. It goes with my eyes.

My little meadowlark is right around this bend!

Was that you?
Yep!

I love whistlin' while I work.

Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.

Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?

Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.

Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?

You ever swerved past lightning? It's awesome!

Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.

Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh good evening!

Welcome to the Gala.

Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again.

Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.

First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales.

This ain't what I expected at all.

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.

This isn't at all what I imagined.

This isn't what I hoped.

This isn't hanging out.

This isn't what I wished for.

No!

I waited all my life...

... for this moment.

And I'm not going to...

... let it slip by.

If it's the last thing I do...

... I'm gonna make this...

... the best night ever!

I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.

I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!

Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your...

friend?
Mmm, sounds good to me.

Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.

Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
Miss Rarity! Stop!

Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.

One would hate to slip.

Yes. "One" certainly would.

One's cloak should take care of the problem.

Oh, of course it will.

C'mon everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!

You reach your right hoof in

You reach your right hoof out

You reach your right hoof in

And you shake it all about

You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout

That's what I'm talking about

You step your left hoof in

You pull it right back out

You step your left hoof in

But you better help him out

You do the Pony Pokey but you'd find a different route

That's what it's all about

You kick your back leg in

You pull your back leg out

You reach your back leg in

Just be brave and have no doubt

You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout

That's what I'm singing about

You tilt your head in

You tilt your head out

You tilt your head it all about

You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout

You're better off without

You stomp your whole self in

You stomp your whole self out

You stomp your whole self in

And you stomp yourself about

You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout

COME OUT!

That's what I'm talking about.

You do the Pony Pokey x3

And that's what it's all about... Yeah!

Young lady, this is not 'that' kind of party.

Ooooooh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaarteeey!

Two apple fritters, please.

Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.

Ahem.
Ahem.

Ahem.
AHEM.

I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?

It's okay, Rariry. I got you covered.

Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.

Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!

I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres.

Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles.

Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.

I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be MINE! MINE!!

Come on, everypony! You wanted a partey? Now it's paaarteeey! 

Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! 

Yeah, woohoo!

Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.

STAGE DIVE!

You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! Seems like the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!

Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!

Afraid to get dirty?! 

This is my chance! 

Yes! Whoa!

Well... it can't get any worse.

You're... going to LOVE ME!!!

Run. 

Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you. 

No! Ugh! Let's go! 

Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.

Don't you think you've had enough?

Another donut! Extra sprinkles!

Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see.

Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever? 

That sound like the worst night ever!
It was!

I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset at us for ruining the Gala.

That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!

Princess Celestia?!

Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.

Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.
It is?

That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. 

And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.

You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.

Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
Talking!

Laughing!

You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
Yeah, Spike. You were right.

As horrible as our night was...

...being together here has made it all better.

In fact, it's made it...

...the best night ever!
