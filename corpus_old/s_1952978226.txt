If you could be anywhere in
the world where would you be?

Anywhere in the world?

Yes, anywhere.

A place where you could sing

and I'll be your manager.

Everyone dismissed except
Miss Shireen Arshadi.

Please stay to speak
with the headmaster.

I'll come with you.
No.

Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

We have a biology exam today.

I'm her lab partner,
so I'll just wait for her.

You've been busy all month.

I can arrange for plenty
of free time...

At your service, ma'am.

We usually don't let people
like you into our school.

Do you know why?

No, ma'am.

Because their character
is questionable.

You're late again
with this semester's tuition.

Sorry, Madam Teacher,
it's my fault.

I borrowed some money
from Shireen, but...

Take it back.

Bring it to my office later.

Get to class.

"Your character is questionable."

Cello suites,

Bach.

More specific.

The cellist, the key, the movement.

Pablo Casals.

Minuet in D Minor.

Cello suites, Bach.

Mehran!

The student has beaten his teacher.

The prodigal son.

Welcome home.
Are you well?

Mom has made one
of her special cakes.

God help us.

Eat it for your mother's sake.

Azar!

How about this one?

Mehran.

Here he is,
as good as new.

You've gotten so thin.

Are you feeling better?

Mehran, I ran into Professor Jamshid

at the University yesterday.

There might be an opening
in the music department.

Music isn't for me
anymore, Father.

What are you saying?

I'm sorry, Father.

Mehran, you've worked so hard...

What, are you scared?

I told my uncle that I'd be home.

Come on, I'll make you
a respectable girl yet.

So, what's your name?

Let's see if you earn
the privilege to know my name.

Vanak Square.

What's your rush?

We're having fun.

Turn it up!
This song is orgasmic.

Who is it?

We're here for the sewing class.

Let me introduce you
to my friend.

Salaam.
Salaam.

This is my cousin, Hossein,
who's coming from America.

America.

I'm gonna go dance.

Don't worry.
Tonight, I'm your professor.

Shireen,

Ho-bag.

Ho-bag, Shireen.

Protection's in the drawer.

Ho-bag?

Don't worry about it.

I can't hear you.

Let's go somewhere we can talk.

Can I ask you a question?

Does it make you jealous?

Why would I be jealous?

Isn't he your boyfriend?

Boy, that's how it's done.

I knew you weren't such a good girl.

Open your mouth.

Hey, check this out.

Beautiful sparkles.

Pour moi?

Pour toi, madame.

This isn't necessary anymore.

Dad, I'm not going to fuck up again.

I'm sorry.

This is your weekly allowance.

I need all your receipts.

Kids, I have to get to work.

Mehran, I have to
tell you something.

You'll die of laughter.

Hello.

Mehran, are you OK?
Leave me be.

Why can't you understand,
I'm better.

I was just...

I know exactly what the fuck
you were trying to do.

Can you help a brother?

Could you help a brother?

Here, brother.

Take this food.

My wife made it.

If you want help, I know a place
that can help you.

Those addicts won't even
leave the mosque in peace.

The mosque is a place for everyone.

God is compassionate.

I'm only here
because of God's mercy.

Seeing young believers
like yourself gives one hope.

I'm Mohammad Mehdi.

Your name, sir?

Pardon me.
My name is Mehran.

So dear Mehran,
what do you do?

What's your profession?

A true Muslim needs to work
and provide for a family.

God has not willed it yet.

Believe in God's plan.
He will provide.

Good morning, mother.

Morning, son.

Shireen, put on some clothes.
You have a suitor.

Yusef, please have a seat.

Shireen! Bring the tea.

Yusef, I present
my niece, Shireen.

Did something happen?

It's nothing.

What a heavy surgery.

My back and feet are killing me.

I'm not that scary.
Tell me if something is wrong, OK?

Mehran...

Tomorrow, we're all
going to the seaside.

Be ready at 7 A.M.

Is that all, Dad?

That's all.

Seems like yesterday,
they were children.

Seems like yesterday,
we were young.

Little devil.

Dad, let's go swimming.

You're all sweaty.
Go in the water.

One day we can all go in
together.

Mommy.

I'm scared.

It's nothing.
You're just a bit sick.

I love you.

I know.

I want to tell you something.

You don't need to,
I already know.

Really?

Let's run away to Dubai.

You'll sing and
I'll be your manager.

You're delirious.

In Dubai,
anything is possible.

It's cold.

Scared?

Dad, pull over.

Are you sick?

It is time for my prayers.

You're joking.

No, it's not a joke.

Atafeh and Mr. Hakimi
will be here soon.

I'll bring tea.

Just wait a second...

This system is hopeless.

Wait, it will get fixed.

1, 2, 3.

I haven't attached the cord
and you're testing.

Can I help?

With the will of God.

I'm grateful.

How I love this song!

I know it's a bit late.

But I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

Thanks.
It was three weeks ago.

One day I'll win it.

The young can dream.

Let's go abroad.

A place we can be free.

We'll go to clubs.

We'll have fun.

Sweet!

Do you feel embarrassed?

A little.

You know what this dork
wants to do here?

Tell us.

Dub "Milk" into Persian.

In the film where Sean Penn is gay?

Milk's non-violent protests
led to a movement.

We'd be like Che.

Here they make Che
into a God-fearing man.

But they can't co-opt a gay figure.

Yes, they can.

They're experts.

They'll make Milk
lead the anti-gay movement.

Exactly.

Don't you want to
change your circumstances?

President Hossein Obama!

Change has come our way.

Hey, don't make fun of Obama.

Don't you see?

What they were doing to the gays
30 years ago,

they're doing to you now.

We'll rock the country with this film.

We'll pour into the streets.

We're united together,
we are gay together.

We knew you were gay.

Don't worry, Atie.

I'll take the role of Milk.

You play his lover,
Diego Luna.

Does that mean I can fuck you?

Yes, please.
Sweet!

This film is not about fucking.

It's about human rights.

Fucking is a human's right.

I swear it's a human's right.

Listen.

We dub "Milk" in the day

for your subversive politics.

And "Sex and the City"
for mainstream subversion.

Isn't that a porn film?

It's always the same with you, Joey.
You're really sick.

"Sex and the City"
will sell like crazy.

And we'll throw "Milk"
on the same DVD.

I want to create serious dialogue.

Sweetie, here anything illegal

becomes politically subversive.

Political acts aren't
that romantic, Atafeh.

With the parents that you had,

subversion and naughtiness
is in your blood.

Shut up, Joey.

I can defend myself.

What did I say?

What did I say?

Do you mind if I play music?

No, it's a nice song.

Very relaxing.

We can go somewhere relaxing.

Excuse me?

Don't be coy.

You're mistaken.
What do you take me for?

What do you think you are?

Sir, please stop the car.

Don't think the clothes fool me.

Stop. I want to get out.

No matter how you dress
yourself, trash is trash.

How about we go
to the police station?

I have some friends there.

Give me your foot.

Excuse me?

I just want your foot.

You think I'm hot?

Like it?

Feels good?

Go to hell.

Mehran!

We've missed you, man.

There is a killer afterparty.

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Shireen! Get down!

Oh, my God, are you okay?

Hossein, let's dub those scenes.

That was awesome.

Fuck the mothers of all the mullahs

who shit all over this country.
