Hey, I wasn't done yet!

Hello?

Cheap bastards!

a Jordan Galland Film

God, I wish I could yell at someone

I am listening

Who let the grim reaper in here?

My dear, I own this entire theater

Well, I've more fifteen minutes left

Fifteen more minutes of that insufferable rehearsal

And I was likely to be strangled by the news of boredom

So, you didn't like it?

A dancer should dance the dance of her life

Toothfairy versus candyland is authobiographical

I had a lot of cavities as a kid

But you're not a kid anymore

You're a woman

Very beautiful woman

And you should be dancing the dance of a beautiful woman

Really?

Sometimes I don't really feel beautiful

Oh

But you are beautiful

Give it a moment to sink in

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead

Ring ring

Hello

Hey, did you just wake up?

No, hi, no. I am ... I am just back from the gym

But you promised to pick up my dress this morning

Great, Why, why don't you just send your boyfriend's right hand to do that

Would you just bring it to Bobby's

Please

I am going to casting and I don't have time

Anna, I don't think that's such a good idea

Mobsters don't generally like ex-boyfriends

He doesn't know who I've used to date

Please, Julsie

No smoking here

You've no job and nothing to do whole day

You really need to grow up

Thank for reminding me

Do you have some young hossie in bed with ya?

No ... no, no

Allright, I've got to go, I am here

Wish me luck

Yeah, ok, bye

You're not gonna need the paper back, ok?

So what do you think is wrong with me, doctor?

Well, this is a sample, and I think it will help with your strange symptoms

It's vague

You're gonna be fine, yeah

Ahh, look, the cat just dragged in

I am allergic to cats

Hey

Uhm ...

This is my dad

And ehm, that's Hugo Pepper

Hugo, What's wrong with you today?

Eeh, sunspots, dizziness, tremors

He's always here

I thought you lived alone

I, I do live in there alone

and my dad works in here ... alone

Can you come and talk to me, Julian?

Yeah

So, I will call you

Hm, you don't have my number

I can find ya, ok?

eh

Aaaaa

eee

You know, it is really hard for me to see you like this, Julian

You look terrible

You've got all these girls who are coming and going

you could've put a revolving door in there and make it easier for them

Dad, I am just fighting off some demons, that's all

I've got just a thing for that

A prescription for fighting demons?

No, this is a prescription for getting a job

Off Broadway production of Hamlet seeks young controllable human theater director

Sounds pretty stupid

Yeah, ok, the interview is in thirty minutes, get going!

No, no, no. I am not gonna get going, dad

I am not a theater director anymore

I've got used to it, I suggest you do the same

Hey, it's either that or you move out of my office

That's fine with me

Wait, like pa ... pay my own rent?

Yeah, well, most people of your age do

Zifromax?

Look, these symptoms are serious, ok?

You're dizzy, you've got fatigue, you're achy

Dad, it's a hangover

Was that blonde a model?

Job interview with a vampire

Eh, Hi

E ... excuse me, hi

My name is Julian Marsh

I saw your ad, in the paper

I requested an aryan body builder

Do you know, where ... where I'd go about the theater directing position?

Oooh

That ad

Oh

Haha

Excuse the dead flowers, the master loves them so

Ok

Come and meet the others

This is Leyuba and Zadeska

They will be doing costumes and make up

They will be also doing some acting

and I will be taking a few rows myself

He's yummy

A real renaissance man and women

It's a real renaissance fair here

The renaissance was a flee market

compared to the glory of Ancient Rome

This is Theo Horace, our writer

Tell me, what do you know about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?

Eh, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, they are two idiots

hired to spy on Hamlet. They ... ehm

They died at the end

Very good, you know your stuff

This is the same theater, where the dancer Lauren Lamont

she was murdered here, right?

Please

Don't interrupt!

We start rehearsals next week

Next week ... ok

well I've the perfect actor in line for Hamlet

Really, really

Oh good, good, good, good

yes, good, yes, I know

Why don't we have him out for a drink, later

I love them Lindlife

Theo never hires anyone he can't party with

It's this thing

I demand an undying devotion to the play

Yeah, of course

One last question

Do you suffer from any blood vessel abnormality

iron inefficiencies, vitamin B deficiencies

and or intravenous drug usage?

No

Oh, you're too good to be true

Ah

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead

Are we interested to see how Shakespeare and zombies go together?

Not zombies!

Vampires!

How?

Yeah, right. That makes way more sense

Girls!

Escort mister Marsh to the door

Good day Julian. Nice to meet you

Come with us

He's perfect

He's young and controllable

and he's human

I am glad I am your friend. Be honest with me

Don't get me wrong man. I love Anna

I am a big Anna fan

I totally miss being your guy's third wheel

some of the best days of my life

But, look, crown Jules ...

you have gotta stop your girlfriend suck life out of you

yeah, you can pick up her dress and soho

you can cure cancer

you can rescue a burning orphanage full of kittens

but trust me

one things girls never forget

is when you cheat on them with a stripper

Really don't ...

dont' do guys that mistake ...

... in college?

Yes, yes they do

absolutely

Your mistake was telling her the truth

after lying to her

and then thinking she will forgive you for it

You're right

that was ...

... stupid

It smells so good in here

It smells great, you know what that's called?

Extreme peace

It's extremely nice

Drives the ladies crazy

Are you out of your mind?

Bobby Bianchi's house?

Do you know, who Bobby Bianchi is?

No, no, no, no, no

no, no, crazy!

You know karate, right?

I know karate, yeah

I've got white belt in karate

Do you know what that means?

I can like

chudo cha

And you know what, by the way

I think this red is maybe the wrong colour for Anna's hair

There's lot of dresses in this place ...

What you just said?

I said, don't think this red ...

No, no, it's not what you said

but how you said

With your hand like, say it like that

Don't you think this red is a wrong colour

I am a genious

Why?

Bobby can't forget on us if he thinks we're gay

You see, this is why you're a director

and this's why I am an actor, right?

Cause I am doing this

It's kind of like, you know: Scorcese and the Nero strike again, bitches!

I am just saying, if it were me

I'll be a shaking little baby

it's just kind of a scary thing, in a theater with a murdered girl

You're not making me feel any better

Can you hold this

I can't have a pink shirt and hold a red dress

Well, you see, in the night you feel the breath of the ghost on your neck

and hear the: whaaa whuu

Right, so I guess you don't want play Hamlet then

No, I didn't said, I am an actor

Well, then stop trying to scare me

Oh, my god

Can I have your autograph?

Shit

Yeah

Shit

Don't be jealous, it's a fan

You are really good as the bumblebee at the comercial

You have a picture of me?

Make it up to Shelley Florence, that's me

That's flattering

I mean, that's weird, but it's flattering

You keep that pen, if you're ever in the play

involing the Hamlet and the vampires

you call the number on that pen

You are in danger

Ok

Ble, bleh

You're in danger

You're loosing your goddamned mind, crazy bat

Who's afraid of Bobby Bianchi?

Are you sick of feeling like a janitor?

Or a cleaning lady?

Get ready to whack some germs

with my new Germ-o-whack

You guys are late

Sorry

Oh my god, what happened to my dress?

I am sorry, this homeless woman came out of nowhere

It's always something coming out of nowhere

I mean shit from nowhere, and what happened to my dress

With my new design, a man can clean his hands

and still feel like a male

not a female

Hey, is that the bumblebee guy from the serial comercial

I can't believe it, in my fucking house?

Ehey!

Hello, je m'appelle Vince, enchante

Very wonderful to be in your domain

When you were grownup, did you ever think

I wanna be all that I can be?

Get it?

Yes, it's very funny. He's very funny

No, with all the honesty, I was always deadly serious about being a hesbian

it's very common for someone who's as gay as I am

Hesbian?

How about you

Totally gay

That's good for you two guys

because I usually like it, when

you know, the goodlooking guys are gay

Me too

Hm, not that I think you two are goodlooking or anything

Hey, listen, have a drink, I gotta go back to my promo conference

Excuse me, I am sorry

Germ-o-whack!

Clean your hands like a male man

What is this have to do with you working for the post office

No, no, it's like being a male but being a man

Isn't it basically just like a water gun

Forget it, forget it, obviously, with rack like that

you don't know what I am talking about, right

Hey, bumblebee, bumbee, help me out with the tagline

need some quick, snap

Idea's are Julian's department

Ah

Allright, allright, give me some, some good

It really sell itself

Come one, hook me up

Germ-o-whack!

It' a mean clean whacking machine

I like that, I am gonna use that

Hey honey, come here, come here

Look hot, baby

Oh, man, I can't watch this

Makes me natious seeing them together

I don't know what she sees in this guy

He gonna be as ... rich and attractive

Where does a girl get a drink in this place?

Waiter, chardonay

I am Vince

Hi Cookie

Hey, you know, I saw you

and I thought - that's a girl who's not afraid to get controversial

You know I really liked - forever people's engines

Absolutely, vrum

Sorry to interrupt, you two love birds

They're taking pictures and her hair is just not quite working for me

I could fix it

Aye, sure kid, you can use my bedroom

as long you keep it nice and clean

Let me see your hands

It's on me

Well, I mean, it's on you, but ...

... it's on me

Do you have to do this every time we get together?

Ok, what the fuck is this?

Bobby is little quirky, he likes to get into mood

Does the mood include puking?

You hate me, don't you?

No, no I don't

I am the opposite of hate you

I heart you

Eew!

You're my soulmate

Double eew!

Did you googled cheesy things to say before you got here?

No, my internet's down

you're, yours everything to me

I, I care about you so much

You still can't say "I love you"

I passion you, I adore you, you're

You're a looser, you live in your dad's office and you have no job!

Well, I do have a job actually, I am directing Hamlet

It's a weird adaptation

Well,

did you cast Ophelia yet?

We do have someone in mind for the role

But, ehm, maybe one of the smaller parts get you audition

Thanks

Come on, let's go nancy boy

Easy, thank you

What's my sexy music doing on?

It was an accident, baby

It was an accident I caught this guy feeling up Cookie Lambet's tits?

I thought he was a queer

Allright, she has breast implants

and she asked me to examine them to see if they felt real

and I tell you what

not bad, really not bad at all, you'd be surprised

Girls like gay men giving them advice

because it's honest and it's not sexually motivated

That's actually true

No, I don't buy it, you guys are out of here

No, you know what, (blabla) you're out of here

You're lucky there's no bullets in this Germ-o-whack, you understand me?

I tell you what, that is one lucky man

one look and two more seconds I would have his ass, Jules

I would have just

Oh, shit, dude, we gotta go back

I forgot my skateboard

No, what, are you kidding me?

That guy is fucking crazy, forget about it

I don't know why we went there at the first place

Not so bad, in the end did get the feel of that girl's tits

think I kinda like being gay

Hey, you gotta tell me about meet this guy by the way

It's not the emotional demands of playing Hamlet that I am concerned about

but there is a physical demand that requires very specific

state of

fitness

Do you suffer from any ...

bone marrow problems?

Ehm ...

No

Vince will do

What just happened, what he say?

Vince will do

So you got it?

Vince will do for Hamlet my friend

Salut

Oh, I got the job, but I am telling you

can't change the name of the play to Hamlette

Enough business

Ladies, tell me the story

What do you do?

Whatever Theo tells us to do

We're his slaves

We are slaves

That's cool man, I can dig that

Jules, did you see that?

you seek the control that this man has over these women

it's unbelievable!

He's a fucking visionary or something

and he can dance

Fellows, I need that table

What's up?

Do me a favor, both of you get up

no no no no no

We're here with Theo

Theo who, I don't see Theo

No, he's here, he's right behing you, he's dancing

You're talking back

I am not talking back ...

Now you're getting loud

No, I am crying over the music

It's very loud in here

Get the fuck up!

I'll open the can, buddy, I will open the can, I will open the ... ah

Ok, allright, ok, hey, you know

I will take this guy outside, I will handle him outside

Ok, hey, hey, ok, easy

I'll tell you what, you're on thin ice, my friend

Son of the bitch!

What the fuck?

Oh, shit!

Hey, look, look , look

What am I looking at?

Oh my god, what the hell is going on?

I feel like I am loosing my goddamned mind

I stood I saw

Theo and those two girls from dance floor

and then there was this other girl and they were like eating her or something

Put this on, we should get your head checked out

No, we should get out of here, that's what we should do

You got hit?

Of course I got hit, it was a fucking fight!

Grave new world

Harry, parry, thrust

Harry, parry, thrust

Dude, I am so psyched about this play inside of play, bro

man, dude, it's like ... we're gonna rock, dog

There is my Rosencrantz and my Guildenstern

Wait, which one am I again?

You're the one who can't read

Put this around your waist

I can read dude, periodicals

Put this on

He means magazines

Great, I don't remember this from the script

Maybe we signed up for the wrong game, bro!

Any play for you would be the wrong game, Carlo

You see guys, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were touched to hip

metaphorically, so ... we're gonna, literally, tie you guys together

and see if we can learn something about the characters

Ok, I get the literal metaphore, but don't you think it's little heavy handed?

I mean I can act without rope

I am trained

I hope so, I have never ..

... never found actors on the internet before

There is a lot of great people on the internet

I've been trained, classically in combat and improvisation

Ok, I'll take that into consideration

Perhaps we should use this to hang Carlo, and cast someone else

That's funny that you're joking around

I hope that means, you guys are completely off book than

Without lines?

Ok, guys, I want everyone here to just close their eyes for one moment

I am serious, close

No peeking mister Liden!

If you're peeking you're only cheating yourself of the experience

Now everyone close your eyes

I want you all to take a moment and think about your characters

How are you like them, how are you not like them

And now I want you to imagine

you're sitting in a field

leaning against an apple tree

and you're little hungry and in front of you is

the most delicious, juicy apple

Ok, now, reach out for it

Say, Jully

What Vince

I got question for you

Make it quick, what?

Help a brother out with the color

Are we talking about red apple, are we talking about green apple, what?

Maybe a pear

It makes no difference

Of course it makes a difference!

Allright, mister Lidon

Look at Theo guys!

Everyone look at Theo!

This is what I am talking about

This is acting!

There is no separation between him and his character

He is his character

Don't look at me!

Ok, stop looking at Theo!

It's good work Theo, it's really good work

One should only eat what one hungers for

That's my philosophy

There are more things in heaven and Earth that are dreamt of your philosophy, Horatio

You should learn to enjoy the gift that I gave you, Hamlet

What gift? I want a gift too

Rosencrantz is a simple mind, prince Hamlet

Forgive him

Jules, is that work with two fingers like that?

Do I need to get my thumb envolved somehow

or prong him?

I just want to devastate him!

I don't really like any of it

It's good that you have learned your lines, finally

Maybe we ... we could try acting a little bit more

Since we are talking about the play, right

like, I was thinking, we could do this modernizations, bro

Instead of Rosencrantz and Guildensterns

Do you think we can be like ...

Rosenbros and Guildendude

or what about like - Dudencrantz and Dogenstern?

Stupid idea

Or like Rosenbros and Goldenhose

Carl, stop!

What do you talking about?

Quick note

There's still time to combine this into one character

Agh, well aimed Horatio

Your arrows have outrageous fortune

Meow

You may be good with arrows and bows, myself I am good with ribbons and bows

Who designed your clothing? That outfit just screams

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark!

Is that a Roman toga?

It's got to go!

To go? What? What is that? That's not on the script

I like it!

We're modernizing!

Hello

Let's continue

Ah, just nothing, play. What do you doing?

You go. All the bloodwork looks greats, so I don't see a problem there

What was the deal with the grapes?

Ate four pounds for dinner last night

Ok, I think, maybe you want to cut back, Ok? Because that's ...

Hey Hugo, you are still sick?

I wouldn't be, if a certain doctor could help me

Hi doctor Marsh

Hey, Anna, I would call him before you go in there

Jesus

Yeah, I wish you could keep him out of trouble

That's not my job anymore

Hello

Do you have some young hossie in bed with ya?

No, no, ehm

I ... I am just getting back from the gym

Just getting back from the gym

Very unlikely

Yeah, I was ... you know, mostly cardiovascular today

You've been blowing me up for two weeks now

and amount such a bedroom with my headshot

I am coming in

Anna, don't, Anna, it's not a good time!

I will, call you

Asshole!

I wasn't so growsed that I might feel little depressed

Yeah, well, you know ... I am impressed

You're going out with the sleaziest guy in the New York City

With him the sleaziness is more like confidence

And he buys me flowers

That's such a predictable thing for you to say

I have to go to the theater

Where I am directing Hamlet ... sort of

I don't know what you're doing

I am coming with you I gotta job of my headshot

The theater is not a democracy

It's a dictatorship and I am the boss here

Hey, Theo, what's up?

She is my Ophelia!

We ... We are already rehearsing with Daisy

She even smells like the real Ophelia

How could you even know?

You tell your miss Daisy she's clearly too old for the role

Get her into wardrobe!

Well, that really worked out well

He's creepy

I think I like him

A street car named Ophelia

Tis now the very witching time of night

when churchyard's yawn hell itself breeds out contagion into this world

Now I could drink hot blood

Oh, with it's noble mind it's here overthrown

Guys, stage left, or my left

Left

How did you know, that I was a vampire, fair Ophelia?

Look at you. Hell is your shirt

Your knees knocking each other

You don't like the shirt? It's my new design. Sheep's feather

I do not understand your hunger for blood

Why you turn those you love into the vampires

Oh but you will understand!

I would ... rather ... die!

Nooo!

Ophelia! Nooo!

Ok, ehh

Theo! We got it more dramatic and maybe we can just

turn it down a little

I know of a potion that will help you

if drunk from the Holy Grail

Your soul will be restored and the vampire's curse shall be lifted

I see what ... what you're trying to do there

The only thing is ... I am not

I am not really sure vampire's gonna cry that much

All I am saying is this

sometimes I feel like you care more about what Theo has to say

than what Julian, the director, has to say

You know, I know, actors think tears make great acting, but

it kinda makes some look like a huge pussy

I think you have us mistaken for someone else

We are not Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

We are Rosencrutz ...

and Goldenstone

yes

Fucking pantaloons

If you let us go, we will share a great and powerful secret with you

Actually what he refers to, is the location of the Holy Grail

This play is really confusing

Let's talk later

Rosencrutz and Goldenstern are dead

Ah, where are their skeletons?

They burst into flames and dissappeared

Wait

Do you know of any good playwrights?

To be, or not to be ...

That is the ...

dilema?

It's good guys, we'll get there

eventually

The Grail's hiding place is in this passage from scripture

Take Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to help you find it

Great guys, that was good

So, that's where you kiss

Why are you interrupting?

Dude

Great over here, Vince great

Theo, I don't think that's how vampire would really do it

Hm?

You know on, on the day I remember, you're gonna have fangs

You know, like ... homework assigment

Go to a costume store , buy some cheap fangs, they'll be like couple bucks

and just for whole day walk around with these things in your mouth

like you're vampire

Argh

You're a killer. You know

You're giving me chills, Theo

You'll do it like that, you'll gonna knock them fucking dead

Yeah, I ... I've believed it

Dial S for Shakespiracy

Brrrraa, ma ma maa

Now I could drink hot blood

Now I could drink hot ...

... blood

Now I could drink hot blood?

Hot blood?

If you were ever in the play with the vampires and Hamlet

You call the number on the side of this pen

You are in danger!

Hello, Rosencrucians and Goldenstone, how may I help you

Hi, yeah

I am in a play with Hamlet and vampires

Vampires and Hamlet, I'll patch you through

An apple a day keeps the demons away

Oh my god, it's you

What, what is this, what's with this, I thought you were supposed to be a homeless

That was a disguise, I work for a secret society

Yes, yes, no, hey, look, that's great

They could be watching me right now, so we don't have a lot of time

The story we're speaking, the vampire puts on the play to trap a large group of victims

and feed on them

Oh, fuck not, that's great

Are they gonna feed on me?

No, every actor in the play will be turned into a vampire

to save on the costs of special effects

and a torso gives the play an authenticity

Charlotte, I can't die, this is terrible timing for me

I am in the prime of my life, I am playing Hamlet right now

Hamlet!

On the lonely seas, you shall find prince Hamlet

and bring him back to me

Theo cannot know that you know, if he asks you questions,

don't answer. Repeat what he says as if you don't understand, with a question mark

What with a question mark?

Oh, that's perfect

A paper is not safe if I am captured

*Pirates threat*

You two cowards, come here quickly

Closer, closer

That's great, that's just great, I knew it

I am gonna have to quit the play

I am gonna have to quit the play!

It's too late for that

You and your friends are as good as undead

I am feeling all tingly inside

unless you follow my instructions exactly

The vampires hate garlic, it's one of the many random rules

Aye, aye. I said to get some pizza ...

with some garlic

Nextime you want to break for lunch, you ask first

and then we'll all break at the same time

I hope you bought enough for everyone

Yeah, yeah

Ok, so tell me this, genious, if Theo is a vampire

how come the sunlight doesn't bother him?

Many have mutated, garlic is one of the only things

that still repels them

Whooh. What's a pizza without garlic

You know, that's my mother used to say

Put it in your food, you must always be eating garlic

Hmm, hmm hm hmm

That's good

Why, why you're helping me?

I work for a secret society, that deals with your cult

Demons, spares, everlasting life, et cetera

Allright, if you want me, vile wenches of the depths

then take me now

Look how easily the prince gives up

How weird he's never been in a fight

Me thinks he's never had his arms cut off

Great, don't fix it, if it's not broken

I don't work with him, until he brushes his teeth or something

His breath is so disgusting he deserves to die

Hey, Zadeska, that's a little bit harsh, don't you think?

Ok, come on

Oh, Jesus man, you stink

I know, I know, can I talk to you for one second, please?

Thank you, great. Fuck it

Ehm, I ... yeah, I know

I think that Theo, is a real Horatio

I know, he's a really good actor, it's actually pretty inspiring

No, no, no, no

You really stink

I know I stink! I have to eat garlic

We had to quit the play

What?

We ...

We have to quit ... the play!

What do you talking about?

We have to quit the play!

We have to quit the play!

Hey, hey, get it together man. You gonna blow this for us

Jules

Try to remember that the best acting is not acting

Why, was I overacting?

As I lay undying

Oh, Horatio, you don't care about life

Naive you are, you just want to destroy the Grail,

but I have hidden it

I have hidden the paper that tells of its location with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

whom you shall never find

Now, die!

Wha, ha, silly prince!

one vampire cannot kill another

since we are both cut from the same evil demon

Goddamned, you know who's gonna get cutted, paleface

You! Cause I know Theo, I know what you are!

No, no, no, Zadeska

Allright, Zadesca that's

No, no, what are you doing?

Horatio had turned Hamlet into vampire in earlier scene

Zadeska, did you read this play?

No, no, oh what?

I

said

no!

Are you ok?

We don't treat actresses like that!

She was being disobidient

I thought that was what you're wanted

I was only trying to protect you, master

Hey, I think you might be getting a little bit into the character

He's not breathing!

What?

Come on, Vince, open your eyes. I know that you're there

If you were to been may deceased by this unfortunate mishap

well well then oh well,

but I know that's not the case!

I can feel you

I can feel you!

Did I do good, master?

No, you did not do good!

It's taken too long, now everyone thinks he's dead

he can't be in the play

We've already have all these posters made

Doctor said it was just a spider bite

Seems so weird

Well, that must have been a really big spider, dog

Like what a?

I don't think he was married bro

Damn, dude, like, fuck, dog

He's still very upset about Vince

Something else's been bothering me too

Does my beard working for my character?

I mean I looked it up all night, it's very shakespearian

But, you know, I am not married to it

What I am saying?

Can we talk about this later?

Yeah, let's table this till maybe after the funeral?

Anna, I want you to know, that even in these darkest of times

Your heavenly presence could make even the dead feel alive

Thank you Theo

Easy buddy, she's with me

Of course

That's just the way I act around the gorgeous woman

Yeah, well, act a little smaller, ok, powder face

Unless you want to play part of the corpse

And Anna, I hope that you won't let this unfortunate incident prevent you

from fullfilling your role as Ophelia

No, I won't quit

You happy now, fancy pance

My name is Charlotte Lawrence

I am part of the secret society, that needs your help

Hm?

I know what happened to Vince

You're in the middle of the two thousand years old conspiracy

If you have any question, watch this DVD

Meet me at the central, first thing tomorow morning

If anyone asks where you're going, you must lie to them

I am not very good liar

Just! Ok

Tell them you have dentist appoitment or something

We don't have much time

Rosencrucians and Goldenstone

What did the priest say?

Oh, ah. Nothing really, you know she just said a few Hail Marys and Our Fathers kind of thing

She?

He! You know, she like the religious she

Listen, Julian, there's no way to recast the play this late date

unfortunately you'll have to play Hamlet now

Thanks for the kind words, Theo

That Theo guy, he's pretty creepy, hm?

I think he's probably a hesbian too. What do you think?

You don't know what hesbian means, do you?

You're flirting with him

You attracted to him?

What do you want me to say?

You suppose to say "I wasn't flirting with him, you idiot!"

I wasn't flirting with him, you idiot!

It does not work now!

Hey, honey, just thought, you know

we could, unwine, what do you say baby, come on

Not after Vince's funeral

Hey, I liked him too, but he was a liar

I had to do a background check

And you know what, I was right

He wasn't even gay

You did a background check on him?

Hey

That's demented

What, I did that with everybody

Vince, just think of the afterlife as an audition

You got the part, man. You gonna be great in the role

Hey, you know, you're not the only one around here with depressing news, you know that?!

I just found out, that my shipment of ten thousand Germ-o-Whacks has got returned, ok?

That insult!

Was a no brainer!

What is that?

What, that, ai ey ... it's a, er, espresso machine

Have you've been filming us having sex?

Come on. So what?

So what? And you think Theo's a creep?

Honey

Wait, ok. Honey, that is important

Harvy, hold on, hold on

Listen, honey, let me talk. Hold on, hold on a second

Let me talk to you

I don't wanna hold on any more

I am leaving you

Hey, if you're going out, could you bring back some soya milk?

And a ... a. Just some soya milk

Harvy, I need you to do some research on this guy

His name is Theo Horace. Some kind of vampire fanatic

Please, don't turn the TV on. It hurts my eyes

Then don't watch it

It's for my job, sorry

Hello, you are being initiated into level one of Rosencrucianism and Goldenstoness

What is this?

Psh

The first written evedence of our secret society

is the rosencrucian and goldenstonian manifesto published in 1615

The author claims that he was inspired by an encounter with two vampires

named Rosencrutz and Goldenstone

They described a four hundred year old duel over the Holy Grail

between a master Vampire named Horatio and his nemesis

the former vampire

prince Hamlet

Who drunk from the Holy Grail curing himself of the vampire curse

then traveled around the world erasing much of Horatio's legacy

curing another vampires of their curse, turning them back into humans

while still retaining his own everlasting life

Today, a vampire Horatio is known as playwright, Theo Horace

Who always hires young, controllable human to direct his plays

and turns every actress in his play

into a vampire bride

We believe, that Hamlet resigned himself for giving Horatio one last chance

to save his soul and that on opening night of Horatio's latest play

Hamlet will confront Horatio and his crusade will end

giving our society a chance at long last to gain possesion of the Holy Grail

Thanks and have a nice day

Is this some form of experimental treatment?

Hi, guys

Anna

Hugo, please

Hi

Hey

Hey

I'm really sad

You look really beautiful

I think that's making me more sad

What happened to Vince was ... made me think differently about everything

That is so weird

I wish we could live forever

together

but we can't

All we have is this moment

Hi, Vince

Hi, Vince

Vince's transformation took far too long

I am going to send Liden with you tonight to kill him

You must learn to do it more quickly

Maybe one of us is going to be promoted to play Hamlet, dog?

Well that is definitely me

Eh, why is it definitely you?

Because, I am pretty sure Hamlet wasn't some sort of spanish male whore

We're going to try a little ...

... exercise

Relax, close your eyes, lie down

More practices, dog?

Yes, dog

Theo, I was thinking, since we're doing an extra reherseal

perhaps we could get an extra scale payment

No!

Ok

But, you're going to enjoy this

Straddle them

This is like kind of kinky, dog

Now, girls, it's imperative that you send to your thoughts

and focus on your objective

Dig in

Now let your blood mingle, as you feel the beat

two, three, four

Let your blood mingle, three four

passion, not emotion, three four

one, two, three, four

Crescendo!

Release!

Good

That was fast

The importance of being honest

This is a weird place for dentist office

Yeah, it's the only place that takes my insurance

What's a Rosicrucian and Goldenstone?

Oh, eh, it's probably like old english for

root canal and gold crown

I'll be like ten minutes

It takes ten minutes?

Yeah, everything's premade here

it's another cool thing about this place

Thank you for coming, Julian

I ain't come here for thank yous

I wanna know why my best friend is dead

I am sorry, but the truth is that everyone involved in a vampire's play dies

or becomes a vampire themselves

Except the director

Tea?

Me?

We, yes, like could make more hot water

No, I mean, me the director? Why?

There are certain rules, that exists between heaven and hell that can't be broken

Just as a vampire cannot enter your home without being invited

he cannot put on a vampire play

unless it is introduced by a human whose blood has not yet been tainted

I know, we're making a vampire play

Theo's play is authobiographical

Shit!

Doesn't anyone make anything up anymore

You need this wooden stake to protect yourself

because after opening night they'll have no use for you

Well, I take an offense there, I don't thinks that's true

We work very hard at the theater

Theo will make your exgirlfriend his bride

He's gonna propose to her?

Fine, she'll say no

She will be immortal like him, they will live forever

Are you trying to make me jealous right now, because it's kind of working

If jealousy motivates you, then let it fuel your fire

You lied about the dentist

Anna, just calm down, hey look, I'll buy you flowers

You're not supposed to tell me first

Hi Theo, wanna take a walk or grab a milkshake

That would be the best milksshake of my life

Wouldn't ... you're lactose intolerant

I almost forgot, this is for you

Oh, give me a break

Thank you

I love roses

She loves roses, Julian

Theo's a vampire

A vampire!

You mean Horatio, don't you?

He's been working too hard, boy, boy

Leyuba

I have been working really hard

Why ... why'd you stop?

Julian

Hey

Get in the car

I ... yeah, that's cool. I think I just gonna walk

Get in the car ... now!

This feels a little, like I've seen from the Godfather

No offense, I don't even know why I said that

Just relax, I am not gonna hurt you

I just need talk to you somewhere in private

There's no way I am getting in that car

Do you love Anna?

Ah, mister Bianchi, I am sure I don't know what that means

Do you care for Anna enough to risk your life to save her?

that's what I'm asking ya

Mister, mister Bianchi ... don Bianchi

ah ... I thought you said you weren't gonna hurt me

I am not gonna hurt you. I know you lied to me about being gay

but I am pass that, I know you were scared of me

Sometimes I speak and I don't think about it first

Whatever

I don't mean any disrespect

I mean ...

Let's whack some fucking vampires!

Yes, let's. What do you talking about?

And I got holding water in it

Holy water

And some other surprises ... do you ... do you know anything about how to kill these things?

Eh ... from what I've been told, I think you can kill them with a stake

They can drink all that raw blood, but they can't handle a stake?

No, no, no, not that kind of stake

This kind of stake

Whoa, yes, yes, see that, that's sick

That is sick, man, that is nasty!

My new invention is gonna come in handy, finally

How is that gonna do anything, it's just a watergun

Fuck, I'll break your, fuck

Break your fucking head open!

I am sorry, it's clearly so much more than just a watergun

Long day's journey into fright

Steady now

Weird, isn't it

Art imitates life

In your case - death

I always loved Alice in wonderland when I was young

So weird that the most famous children story was written by a pedophile

Tis true. The most best books are written by sinners

and the most romantic by men who

cannot actually love

This is so eerie. I forgot how much cemetaries creep me out

You're a vampire, Zadeska. Creepines is sort of part of the job

Would you let me focus?!

Somewhere over here?

What ... what happened to Vince's body?

My private detective said Vince got out

What does it even mean, Vince got out?

You know what I mean

Vince is a freaking vampire, you dipshit

Like, what you're saying, he just pushes his coffin out of the ground?

Where the hell's Harvy?

He's being digested

Stay close, they can't hurt me

They can't hurt the director of play

Hey, I think you've got a delusions of grandier there, kiddo

Get out your Germ-o-Whack!

I was in love once

... with Ophelia

I was in love with Charles and Charge, so ...

No, Anna

the real Ophelia, the one who died seven hundred years ago

All this time, I've been searching for her

Anna. You are the key that could free me from this cage

But you're not in a cage

Without your love

All the world is a cage

Why is nothing happening?

I thought you said there was holy water in it

I can't believe that priest lied to me

I'll kill him

Hm, you don't like crucifix, hey, crazy bitch

Bobby, the stake!

Where is it?

It's on your left

Shit, I got it!

You like to attack on my friend?

Right back at you!

We should go

Don't fight it

You're mine now

It is our fate

Holy shit, wow

I've never killed anybody before

But ... I guess she was dead already, right?

I thought ... I thought you were in the mafia

What? Just because I am Italian American wealthy, you think I am in Mafia?

It's always the same fucking stereotype

you people make me sick!

Where the fuck the other one go?

I am going home to get some rest

Hey, kitty. What? Neighbour throw you out?

Hey, you can keep me company at night?

Could use a little company

The cats like soya milk?

There you go

Somebody misses their girlfriend?

Oh shit!

Vampires are not allowed in somebody's house unless they're invited

You've just invited me in

Fucking cat!

Goddamn it!

How does it feel?

Hello

Hey, Anna, it's me, ok, please don't hang up

I am really sorry I lied to you yesterday

I wanna tell you the truth, ok?

No, no. It's me. I was being a bitch, I am so sorry

Something was really eating away at me

You were kind of being a bitch

Ehm, look. It doesn't matter. I totally forgive you

Just ... I need you to meet me at Vince's grave like as fast you can get there

Ok

Ok, wow. That was easy

Miss you, I'll talk to you later

Ok, bye

Wake up!

Wake up!

Wake up!

What the hell?

I tied you up and drugged you, but I don't wanna hurt you

I am standing outside Bobby Bianchi's home

with the forty old ...

I've been waiting for an hour and half

this hat has to protect my brain from radiowaves

Bobby Bianchi?

... inside sources reveal, that ...

Bobby Bianchi's dead?

... wooden stake bears the fingerprints of this young man,

Julian Marsh

Holy fucking shit!

It's you!

The motive appears to be, a love triangle

She killed him?

No

I can't breathe

No, I didn't kill anybody

Shh, quiet, relax! Noone's gonna get hurt

Aye, mate

The police are outside

I need you to meet me in one hour at my headquaters

Don't shoot him

We're gonna time up

The policeman cometh

I am not saying I liked Bobby Bianchi, you know

He ... he was criminal

and ... ehm, you know, he was murdered

and now that's, my point really is

the man was murdered and murder is still illegal

Officers, I will be ... right with you

This patient is having seizures

and needs to be rushed to the hospital immediately

Like, could you please get the door, officer

and I will meet you at the hospital

So we're looking for doctor Marsh

I am doctor Marsh

Ok, great, well

I am detective Wimbly

We're here, we have a search warrant for the premises ...

revealing, voila

And we would like to ask you some questions about your son, Julian

Right, I will be ... right with you in a moment

but I need to attend to another seriously ill patient

Julian's room is over here

Ok

So anyway, what I was saying

the real question just to wrap that, that little conversation up ...

is ... was Bobby Bianchi bad enough

so that it's good thing that he's dead or ...

was he good enough that it's bad that he's now dead?

Wait ... no

Ya, that's what I meant, so?

Do ... you know, I mean

You know what, just, could you go get us some evidence?

So I can put this sick fuck away

Gastro intestinal leakage

Holy shit, fuck man!

Are you a fucking ninja?!

Walking through walls now, it really scared me, man

Oh, look at this, good job

Wow, look at that, wow, he's a lunatic

Officers?

Hey, doc, you know what. Sorry, one minute

A side note here, what's the deal with this stomach leakage?

Is that, I didn't know there was possibility

Is this like, something I should be worried

Nah, I had him on warm milk for two weeks and it cleared up

Thanks

Ok, so your son is crazy, as you probably know

and we have enough evidence here to plead insanity

if he turns himself in or

if you tell us where we can find him

Unit two-three-four-one

Julian Marsh has been spotted on Malberry street headed towards the cemetary

Oops, too late. We'll be in touch

I need you to cooperate and come with me quietly

I know that your son is innocent

Aye, he certainly ain't innocent

but you sure as hell aren't

Perhaps I didn't make myself clear

Just because I don't want to hurt you

doesn't mean that I won't

Ah, Anna, you scared me!

Hi baby

Listen, I am sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but

this is crazy, but Vince is a vamp ...

Oh my god, what is she ...

what is she doing here?

Get the fuck away from me

Guys!

Hold it right there!

You're under arrest for the murder of Bobby Bianchi

I've been framed?

Yeah, ok, you've been framed

You're gonna tell me next, you've been framed for evident

freaky threesome in the graveyard, right?

Cause that's a little too intense

that's a thing that I was home you

about being a big city cop

you've gotta be able to pick up crazy immediately, you know

Whoa, ok, girls

Seriously!

We're policemen, ladies!

Two officers down

Call a medic immediately

So I told him, "Horses don't know what a crucifix is"

That's so hillarious. You have beautiful hair and teeth

Why is my dad tied up?

Guess, we just got to talking

I am so tied up!

Why don't we untie him?

Oh right

You're son is insane

He took me to a cemetary. To meet some strippers

I think they were hookers

There was an orgy. And then they attacked the cops

Wait a second

I can breath without a mask. I can see without the glasses

There's no more sunspots

It's a miracle

Thank you. I am cured

Yeah, that's no problem, Hugo

Can I get some bread?

I don't think I can get through this anymore

It does not matter if I introduce the play or not

The girl I love is vampire

With your help, Julian, we will hopefully recover the Grail

and once we have it, you can cure Anna

It doesn't matter, it's over

Hugo, why are you tapping me?

Well, as someone who witnessed your healing powers today

I think you're on a role

And as a girl

I can tell you that girls tend to get properly turned on

when a boy saves their soul from eternal damnation

Come on, Jules, what's the worst thing that can happen?

I don't know, dad. Maybe that I die

or become a vampire

Have you seen him? Have you seen Julian?

Have you seen him? Is he here?

He's not here yet

If he doesn't show, I ... I ... could get some coffee already

Boss!

Julian ...

Julian, yes, yes, I know, I am looking for Julian. He's not here

Julian

Spit it out!

He's here

He's here?

He's here

Hello ladies and gentlemen

Lidon, have a good show

My best friend Vince once told me

an actor goes where he's needed

Well, Vince was needed in the big theater in the sky

so ... I'll be filling in form as Hamlet

There's something you all should know

All the vampires in this play are real

There's a good chance they're gonna try to feed on you

or maybe even make you a vampire too

as soon as the play ends, run for your life

Another thing that is real

is the love that Hamlet feels for Ophelia

Hamlet loves Ophelia

So if anyone has the Holy Grail

I could really use it right now

Does anyone in the audience have the Holy Grail?

Raise your hand and I sure will come to get it from you

Ok, well. Enjoy the show and remember:

Run for your life

Death of a pale man

Dilema, no?

Question. What do you think about question?

I don't care, mister Spakesheare

I am not asking you to write The merchant of Venice part two

I only need you to get a clear message to Hamlet

That those two idiotic vampires he thought might help him ...

... are dead

I have to hide this vampire nonsense under the dialog

because I don't feel like being burned at the stake this month

and if the play is no good

then the review will be horrible

and this Hamlet person, whoever he is

won't show up!

Don't! Yell! At me!

I only ask you to write these words:

Rosencrantz

and Guildenstern

are dead

You've said Hamlet really loves Ophelia

What is that mean?

I am gonna try to find the Grail, cure this curse

Anna, you're on stage! In thirty seconds

Ok

But it's not a curse, it's a gift

And with it you never have to grow up

I thought you wanna me to grow up

Women ...

Rosencrantz

This meeting likes me much

We have not met since we were babies

I have come in hopes that I may claim once more my baby love

Oh, what the hell is this?

Come on, come on!

What do you doing?

This play that's Horatio wrote with Shakespeare

makes us look like idiots!

So I found this guy, W. S. Gilbert

to write the play where we are the heroes

This cool, no?

No, it's not cool

Horatio will still think we are alive

We gotta find way out of this mess

Think, Guildenstern, think

We could write a newer play and call it

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead

or something

You idiot!

You imbecile!

You ...

... genious!

I think it will work

Now, can we get Tom Stoppard to write it?

I hope you don't mind if I just ...

At last

The Grail is mine

You're under arrest for the murder of Bobby Bianchi

Ok, I ... I give up

What, no. Not you kid

This girl, she ... this crazy ... she bit me

You know you're off the hook actually

We've found Bobby's collection of homemade porn

you got to see this stuff

very ... well, it's not bad actually, very ...

... organic

Anyway, she can be seen, right there on the video

sucking his blood, after she stabbed him

really crazy!

She's obviously unbalanced, but

we cracked the case

didn't have to do

Case closed

What the?

Whoa

What, what, did ...

What did you ... What happened?

I think this is something that we don't file or report on

I think this is something that we forget about and we just pretend ...

just pretend this didn't happen if that's ...

you're OK with that

I am OK with that

OK

You'll clean up the ...

No, I am just gonna say this, cause this is right time

I need you to talk to me

Ok, though I feel like a real woman saying that, but I need your support

We're police officers and we've got partners for a reason

Ok, why don't I just ...

.. buy you a beer?

I like that

I like that

The Grail is mine

Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there!

Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there!

Be there!

Grrr!

Of course it would be empty

Hamlet got here first!

Oh Hamlet!

Hamlet!

Ladies and gentleman

I knew that Hamlet

wouldn't miss it for the world

and I was right

It's Hamlet, the real Hamlet

My play is turning out awesome

I suppose

that this is my entrance

I ... I don't know

I've actually never been on stage before

For every entrance there must be an exit somewhere

I just got here

Next it from what, Horatio, I am confused

Oh, from life, perhaps

Not a day goes by, that I don't dispise you

for giving up a gift which I gave you

The only one you should dispise is whomever dresses you!

My god, Horatio, for reals

Look at yourself, Hamlet

you've got the vitality and energy of a custard

Is that what you get from sipping on a Holy Grail?

No! That's what you get when you have a great workout routine

and you stick to it!

Oh god. Oh, thanks for showing up

now that I thought I just got a vampire by myself

I've got to secure the Grail

You had to change outfits to secure the Grail?

Coming in, mister Liden

Charlotte, I have visual confirmation on Hamlet

Retrieve the Grail!

Mister Lidon's with you guys?

Why doesn't anybody tell me anything?

I turned you into a vampire!

Also, by having Shakespeare write that epic tragedy

I turned you into a god

The only tragedy here is who in the hell

is Rosencrantz's and Guildenstern's acting couch!

I mean, right, people, am I right?

They're awful, just terrible!

Now is this a soliloquy or ... an asidethat I am doing?

Now you know, why I have to kill him

Kill him!

Must ... eat ... Hamlet

Eat or die, dog

Bony

In the Hamlet, you made me look like a lunatic

in this play ...

Well, it's actually quite close

Don't you think? I thought so

What do you, guys?

I thought so too

Me too

I love you

Bravo

Kiss me

But you're my sister

Listen to me, Hamlet

A vampire is the most graceful

majestic and powerful of creatures

You would throw that away?

God, your breath stinks

The smell of blood was once sweet to you, Hamlet!

Yes, and now it just tastes like ...

... blood

Horatio

You must choose

either death

or

cleanse thyself by sipping

from the Holy ...

Grail! Repeat. Visual confirmation on the Grail!

You must choose

But choose wisely

You choose death then

You battled to the end there, Horatio

Thank you

Charlotte!

I have the Grail, repeat, I have the Grail

Thank you, thank you

Yes, yes, give it to me

What do you doing, I need the Grail to cure Anna

There's no time

The only way to save Anna now is to kill her

Kill her? What do you talking about? Kill her?

You just ... you lied to me then. You used me

Take a bow?

Yes, just like you used all this leading ladies

Hey, that was absolutely wonderful

Great special effects

Thank you very much

Thank you. Bravo me, yes I know. Thank you, thank you

You know, I do a little bit of acting myself

Really?

Yes, there is my number

Thank you

Yes, I know I was excellent. Thank you

I will give you a call

Yes

Call me, ok?

Call me too

Oh, Julian, that was by far the best production I've seen in my life

since Missis Doubtfire, perhaps

Thank you so much, prince Hamlet

Please, call me mister Hamlet, Julian

Julian ...

Julian, ha, three hundred years ago

I slept with a man, accidentaly, named Julian

Oh, Horatio

How many years I've dreamt of holding your skull in my hands

Here, give this to your prop guy

I am off to find that hot piece of ass from the second row

Charlotte?

Shit

Hey

Hi

I've talked to Charlotte Lawrence

and she said that the only way

that I can save your soul is to kill you

But this is your chance to win me back

But you're already un ...

unbelievably attracted to you

I was gonna say undead

Exactly

Which is why we can be together forever

You want that, don't you, Julian?

Yeah

And?

And?

I love you

Breakfast is Tiffany

Hello

Did you just wake up?

Eehm, no, no. I am trying out a new workout

It's called lying down

Do you have some young hossie in bed with you?

Actually, yes

Aye ... we'll will be there in ten minutes

We? Who's ... who's we?

Who is this? I want to suck your balls

Vince!

Guess what I am doing right now

I am looking at review of a certain someone's little play

and I tell you what, it's so goddamn good

that I need a promise that I can be in a next one

That's all there is to it

Yeah, right, listen Vince

Crazy how life works

How ironic is it that I told you

your exgirlfriend was sucking life out of you

when as it turns out

lady's in honest to got vampire

Dude, I am so happy that you're ok, man

I would have given anything just to hear your voice one more time

Hey, man

Could you put Anna back on the phone?

Yeah

Jules

Anna, hey, before I forget to tell you

I found Charlotte Lawrence again

I tracked her down and

so we can sip from the Grail

and not have our souls

be

forever damned or whatever

But a vampire doesn't need to save her soul when ...

When, when what?

When she has a soulmate

Aaah, babe

You're my soulmate too

Allright, bye

Sorry, that was

that was my girlfriend

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are undead
