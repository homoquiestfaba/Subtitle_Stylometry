Everybody, shut up!

All mothers out!

Georgie, Georgie!
I don't want 'em in the wings.

I don't want 'em in the theater,
I want 'em out!

It's a pleasure,
okay, mothers! Move!

Out!

All right, kids,

Let's get in a straight line.

Come on, here.

Come forward one at a time.

The doors open at 7:00,

And Uncle Jocko doesn't
have time to rehearse

each of your darling acts.

Um, you-- you-- you wait

right over here, girlie-girl.

Gus, hit this doll
with a surprise pink when
she does her turn.

Uncle Jocko promised
the wee bairn would be
a winner, and she will.

Yeah, there.

A chip off her
sister's block.

You ought to see
them balloons.

Okay, who's the
first wee laddie

in Uncle Jocko's
kiddie show today?

Take each of them from the top
and then cut to the last eight.

Every Friday night...

â™ª Ya-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da

Uncle Jocko didn't
ken there were so many

talented bairns right
here in Seattle--

And the rest of that crap.

"Clarence and his
classic clarinet."

â™ªâ™ª

Georgie, that's what's going
to kill vaudeville.

Okay, Clarence,
cut to the end.

The end, kiddo.
The end, professor.

And who does Uncle
Jocko have here?

Who the hell does
he have here?

Baby June and company?

Half the song,
half the dance, and out.

Gotcha.

â™ª May we entertain you?

â™ª May we see you smile?

â™ª I will do some kicks oh!

â™ª I will do some tricks

Sing out, Louise, sing out!

â™ª I'll tell you a story

Who said that?

â™ª I'll dance when...

You're behind, Louise!

Catch up, baby, catch up!

Who let in one
of their mothers?

Hold it, please, hold it.

Save your strength, June.

Louise, dear,
if you don't count--

Madam, do you realize
you are absolutely--

Oh, I do, Uncle Jocko.

But I want to save your very
valuable time for you.

When I saw your sensitive face
at the Odd Fellows hall--

You know, my first husband
was an Odd Fellow.

I am not an Odd Fellow.I meant the Knights of Pythias.

My second husband was
a Knight of Pythias.

I'm not a Knight of Pythias.

Well, where did you
catch our act?At the Elks.

My father was an Elk.

I have his tooth
in here someplace.

Will you just hold
Chowsie for me?

That's short for chow mein.

Mommy just loves chow mein,
doesn't she, Chowsie wowsie?

Louise, stop sucking your thumb.

Professor, ahh!

I just marvel how you can make
a performer into an artiste.

Now if you could just help my
little girls by giving them

a good loud...
â™ª Dee-dee-da da-da-da

What is going on here?

God helps him
who helps himself.

Oh, Mr. Zipser, Mr. Zipser!

When the girls do their
specialty, could you
please ad lick it?

Thank you.
Show 'em, girls!

Oh, Gus, Gus!
Would you please slap

Baby June with something pink?

She's the star.

Smile, baby, dear.

I have seen all kinds
of mothers--

Don't hang on the baby's dress.
You'll rumple it up.

Do you know a really
good agent who could book
a professional act like ours?

Professional? Hey, Georgie,
Get a load of this.

Don't you laugh.

Don't you dare laugh.

That child is
gonna be a star.

That's what they all say.

All right?

But we're not finished.

You are, as far
as I'm concerned.

Because you're trying
to play favorites.What?

How dare you let that rotten,
untalented, fat balloon

block up my babies?

I won't leave the stage
until she does.

That child--Have you no loyalty
to the Elks?

I'm not an Elk!

Well, the editor
of "The Gazette" is.

And I happen to know
because, the last meeting,

he showed my father a letter
he got complaining

that some contest was fixed.

I guess desperate people
do desperate things.

â™ª Da-da-dee da-da-da

â™ª May we entertain you?

â™ª May we see you smile?

Thank you, Professor.

Thank you, Uncle Jocko.

Thank you, Gus!

Thank you, Mr. Zipser.

Smile, girls, smile.

How do you like that?
That rotten little Uncle Jocko.

He's as cheap as your grandpa.

10 bucks for a talent
like yours!

Well, we're through
with kiddie shows

and with your grandpa's
lodge hall.

Time we were moving on anyway.

I'm gonna get us an agent
to book the act
on the Orpheum circuit.

That's dog food, Mama.

That's what he thinks.
I'm hungry.

Then why didn't you eat some of
our chow mein after the show?

'Cause you two did the work and
we've got to save every cent.

I had a dream last night.

I dreamt a whole new act
for you.

"Baby June and her Newsboys."

How are you gonna
get the boys, Mama?

Louise can be a boy.

And I'll find three others.

Well, how are you
gonna pay them?

The experience
will be their pay.

I got just enough saved up
for scenery and costumes.

If I can just squeeze a couple
more bucks out of Grandpa,

we can head for Los Angeles
and the Orpheum circuit.

Good night, Mama.

Good night, Grandpa.

You ought to be ashamed.

Fooling your kids
with those dreams.

They're real dreams,
and I'm gonna make them
come real for my kids.

What are you, Rose,
a crazy woman?

God put you down right here

because he meant for
you to stay right here.

God's like me, Pop.

We both need
outside assistance.

Huh, you've squeezed
the last penny out of me

that you're ever gonna get.

It ain't for me.
It's for my girls!

It's too late for me.

It ain't too late for you to
get a husband to support you.

After three husbands,
I want to enjoy myself.

I want the girls to enjoy
themselves and travel...

Like Mama does.

And you'll leave them just
like your mother left you.

Never!

Why aren't you ready
for bed, Louise?

June says you said she can
sleep with you tonight.

You know how high-strung the
baby is after a performance.

I performed.

It ain't the same.

Now say good night
and go to bed.

Good night, Grandpa.

Good night, Louise.
You're a good girl.

You are a good girl, and I was
proud of you tonight.

Mama...

How come I have three fathers?

'Cause you're lucky.
You were born with a caul.

That means you have the powers
to read palms and tell fortunes

and wonderful things
are gonna happen to you.

Why do you fill her
with such bunk?

It ain't bunk.

Nothing wonderful
is going to happen to her

or to June or to you.

Maybe not to me, but they're
gonna have a marvelous time.

I'll be damned if I'll let
them sit their lives away

like I did or like you
do with only that calendar

on the wall to tell
you one day from the next

or that plaque from your
rotten railroad company

to say, "congratulations.

For 50 years you did the same
dull thing every dull day."

That plaque
is a great tribute....

It's solid gold.

How much could
you get for it?

Rose, if you ever--

Well, what good's it
doing sitting up there?

That plaque belongs there
like you belong home!

Oh, anybody that
stays home is dead.

If I die, it won't
be from sitting.

It will be from fighting
to get up and get out!

â™ª Some people can get a thrill

â™ª Knitting sweaters

â™ª And sitting still

â™ª That's okay
for some people â™ª

â™ª Who don't know they're alive

â™ª Some people

â™ª Can thrive and bloom

â™ª Living life

â™ª In the living room

â™ª That's perfect

â™ª For some people

â™ª Of 105

â™ª But I

â™ª At least gotta try

â™ª When I think of all the sights
that I gotta see â™ª

â™ª And all the places
I gotta play â™ª

â™ª All the things that I gotta
be yet come on, Papa â™ª

â™ª What do you say?

â™ª Some people can be content

â™ª Playing bingo

â™ª And paying rent

â™ª That's peachy

â™ª For some people

â™ª For some humdrum people

â™ª To be

â™ª But some people ain't me

â™ª I had a dream

â™ª A wonderful dream, Papa

â™ª All about June
in the Orpheum circuit â™ª

â™ª Give me a chance
and I know I can work it â™ª

â™ª I had a dream

â™ª Just as real
as can be, Papa â™ª

â™ª There I was
in Mr. Orpheum's office â™ª

â™ª And he was saying to me

â™ª Rose, get yourself
some new orchestrations â™ª

â™ª New routines
and red velvet curtains â™ª

â™ª Get a feathered hat
for the baby â™ª

â™ª Photographs in front
of the theater â™ª

â™ª Get an agent
and in jig time â™ª

â™ª You'll be being booked

â™ª In the big time

â™ª Oh, what a dream

â™ª A wonderful dream, Papa

â™ª And all that I need

â™ª Is 88 bucks, Papa

â™ª That's what he said, Papa

â™ª Only 88 bucks...

You ain't getting 88 cents
from me, Rose.

Well, I'll get it someplace
else, but I'll get it!

And get my kids out!

â™ª Goodbye

â™ª To blueberry pie

â™ª Good riddance to all the
socials I had to go to â™ª

â™ª All the lodges
I had to play â™ª

â™ª All the Shriners
I said hello to â™ª

â™ª Hey, L.A.
I'm coming your way â™ª

â™ª Some people

â™ª Sit on their butts

â™ª Got the dream, yeah

â™ª But not the guts

â™ª That's living

â™ª For some people

â™ª For some humdrum people

â™ª I suppose

â™ª Well, they can stay and rot

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª But not Rose â™ª

No, Madam Rose, no.

Mr. Weber, you don't know
how to run your theater.

Your business is slipping.

You need youth!
Fresh young talent!

Madam Rose, I told
you this morning,

I told you this afternoon,
and I'm telling you now.

If there is anything
I hate worse than kids,

it's kids onstage!Shh!

Children, go play
in the alley.

Mr. Weber, that was
a rotten remark.

And if you were a gentleman,
you would apologize

and book my act.

I am not a gentleman.

Yes, you are!
Deep down you are.

Herbie, I've been looking
all over for you to get
your opinion of the show.

I doubled your Crackerjack
order, Ed.

That bad?

Except for a couple of acts.

I left a memo on your desk.

Mr. Weber, you left me
in the middle of a sentence.

Madam Rose, you're always
in the middle of a sentence.

But if your show is as rotten as
this intelligent gentleman says,

you could certainly
try my act for a couple
of nights, couldn't he?

Yeah, he could.
You could, Ed.

What?

Your theater gets
a family audience.

They love kids.

And my kids are great.

They sure are.

How do
you know?I've seen 'em.

Where?In Seattle.

It would give your
show a lift, Ed.

Well...Listen--

Stop pushing.
Let me think it over.

Oh, gee...

It's hard for me
to say thanks.

You just said it.

Why'd he listen to you?

Everybody in show business
listens to anybody.

Besides, I used to book acts
into this theater.

Are you an agent?

I was, but I'm in
the candy business now.

I sell to vaudeville houses
all over the West.

How could you ever
leave show business?

When the acts I handled

had too little talent, I got
sick to my stomach-- ulcers.

Oh, you're too sympathetic.

Also, I went bust.

I was always giving
them my commission

and telling them
they got a raise.

The good Lord says
charity begins at home.

Well, I don't have a home.

You're not married?

I had five sisters
and the ugly one

didn't get married
until a year ago.

Why did you
help me just now?

I love kids.

Oh.

Also, I've seen
you before.Where?

Waiting outside
Weber's office.

You looked like a pioneer
woman without a frontier.

Hmm.

I, uh, I don't suppose you'd
consider being an agent again.

Would you consider
marrying again?

How do you know
I'm not married now?

I asked your kids about you.

Oh.

Well, after three husbands,

it takes a lot of butter to
get you back in the frying pan.

After 20 years
in show business,

you kind of breathe
better in the real world.

Funny.

What?Us.

I like you...

But I don't want marriage.

You like me...

But you don't want
show business.

That seems to leave
you there and me here.

That all depends on
how you look at it.

You look at what
we don't have.

I look at what
we do have.

â™ª You're a stranger

â™ª Who's come here

Well, I'm not gonna
pay 'em much money.

Oh, you'll have to talk
about money to Herbie.

Are you handling her act?

No, I can't--
but I can't--

Yeah, I guess I am.

I'll be in the office.

â™ª We have

â™ª So much in common

â™ª It's a phenomenon

â™ª We could

â™ª Pool our resources

â™ª From now on...

Rose, is this act
of yours any good?

Good? It's great.
And June is sensational.

Wait till you see it.

Baby June!

Hello, everybody!

My name is June.

What's yours?!

â™ª Let me entertain you

â™ª Let me make you smile

â™ª Let me
do a few tricks â™ª

â™ª Some old and then

â™ª We'll have a real good

â™ª Time

Oh!

Oh!

Okay, now go ahead.

Whew.

Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

You're very kind.

You know,
everyone has someone

to thank for their success.

Usually it's their mother.

And sometimes
it's their father.

But tonight, I would
like you all to join me

in giving thanks

to an uncle of mine

and an uncle of yours--

the greatest
uncle of them all,

our Uncle Sam!

â™ªâ™ª

Yah!

â™ªâ™ª

Yah!

â™ªâ™ª

Yah!

â™ªâ™ª

Mr. Conductor, if you please.

["The Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing]

Oh!

Oh!

All right,
all right.

We're up,
Madam Rose.

It ain't even 10:00 yet,
turn it off.

Louise, Louise,
turn it off, Louise.

I was having
the loveliest dream

about a special day.

My dream book says that you have
a dream like that because--

We wanna sleep!

Well, I just wanted
to say that maybe--

Shh!

How can you all sleep
on such a beautiful day?

You woke up mother.

I didn't mean to.

It's just that today is my...
Well, you know.

Today is the one day when
we don't have to travel

and we don't
have to rehearse.

Which means
we could sleep.

Is Mama mad?

She's in the bathroom
making coffee.

She says as long
as she's up,

everybody come
have breakfast.

Thanks a lot, Louise.

Well, I said I'm sorry.

Mama?

Mama?

Happy Birthday!

Surprise!

â™ª Happy birthday to you

â™ª Happy birthday to you

â™ª Happy birthday,
dear Louise â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to â™ª You

Yay!

Make a wish.
Go on, make a wish.

I wish...

Oh, Mama, I wish--

Oh, that rotten monkey ate
a piece out of the cake.

Gigolo! Bad gigolo,
bad, bad.

I wish--Make a wish.

One, two, three.

I wish--

Say, that'd make
a good coat.

Yay!

Hey, there's only
10 candles on this cake.

What do you care?
You ain't gonna
eat candles.

But she only had
10 candles last year.

And the year
before that.

Come to think of it
she's had 10 candles--

Stop right there!

As long as we
have this act,

nobody's over 10
and you all know it,

except of course me and--

Where's Herbie?
I had a dream.

Tulsa, go across the hall
and see what's keeping Herbie.

The rest of you can
give Louise her presents

while I go see if the
chow mein is warmed up.

Chow mein?

It's my birthday.

But chow mein
for breakfast?

Why not?
There's egg roll,
ain't there?

If Madam Rose paid us
a salary, we could have
bought you presents, Louise.

But it's more fun to clip
from the five-and-dime.

A catcher's mitt and
a big-league baseball.

Oh, thank you, Yonkers.

Here's a
real stuffed cat.

I love it, Kansas.

And I clipped
a goldfish bowl.

I'll give you
the fish for lent.

Thanks, L.A.

Oh, what a beautiful
package, June.

It's a complete sewing set
in a velvet-lined basket.

I should have wrapped them.

Oh, you don't have
to wrap books.

Well, happy birthday,
Louise.

Happy birthday, Tulsa.

I mean, you're welcome.

I mean, thank you.

All right, one egg roll
apiece and no more.

Herbie wasn't in his
room, Madam Rose. No.He wasn't?

Where could he be?

Mama, can I see my
present from you now?

It's from Herbie and me.

it's not from Herbie,
he's an agent.

It's from you.

well, I picked it out,
but Herbie paid for it

with his commission
for a whole month.

Old Herbie makes the same
salary we do.

Inside, you, and
get the coffee.

Here I am, busting to tell
Herbie about the dream I had.

Mama--

It's really in your honor
coming on the very

evening of your birthday.

Oh, baby, you'll love it.

Children, you'll all love it.

It's a new act.

Ohh...

In this dream I saw June singing
a song in, like, a barnyard.

And then a cow came onstage.

A cow?

Hey, that's
pretty sexy.

Not a real cow.

A kind of a dancing cow
with a great big smile.

And that cow-- that cow
leaned right over my bed

and spoke to me.

What did the cow say?

Madam Rose!

I'm not cooking in here,
Mr. Kringelein! That--

Open this door!

I'm dressing. That cow--

Madam Rose!

I'll call you tomorrow
when I'm finished!

Ah!

That dear, fat cow looked me
right in the eye and said,

"Rose, if you want to get
on the Orpheum circuit,
put me in your act."

Children, you know
what I'm gonna go?

You're gonna pay that
crummy cow and not us.

I ain't paying anybody.

But I'm gonna take
the cow's advice.

I'm gonna call the new act

"Dainty June and Her Farm Boys."

I'm gonna get more boys.

I'm gonna put the cow in the act
and Chowsie and the monkey

and Louise's present,
if you don't mind, honey.

But, Mama, I don't even
know what my present is.

No cooking, Madam Rose?

How dare you enter a lady's
boudoir without even knocking?

Vere is your hot plate?

"Vere" is your search warrant?Plan B!

Never in all my years
of running a theatrical
hotel, have I ever--

If you don't leave,
I'm gonna scream!

But you know the rules!

No cooking, no electrical
appliances...

No dogs, no cats,

No pets of any kind.

Happy birthday, darling.Oh, Mama.

It's a damn zoo.

Profanity in front
of my babies.

June, get the bible.
Get the bible!

You pack up this dirty
menagerie and get out!

You'll have to throw me out,
you rotten animal hater.

That's what he is.
Send for the S.P.C.A.

Send for the police.

I rented these two rooms
to one adult and three children.

And now I find one adult,
five pets,

and one, two, three, four--

You counted him twice!

A simple little birthday
party for my baby.

One, two, three--
Stand still!

Chow mein, I'd offer you some,
but there's only one egg roll.

How many people are
sleeping in that room?

What room, Mr. Kringelein?

This room, madam, this room.

There isn't a soul in this
room, Mr. Kringelein.

No, but I mean--Except you and me.

Argh! Mr. Kringelein!Stop it!

What are you trying to do?

Stop! Help! Help! Rape!

My babies! My babies!

Monster!

Oh!

Madam Rose, are you okay?

Thank you

A little birthday party--
chow mein, a tiny little cake.

Rose, Rose,
are you all right?

Rose, what's happened?
Are you okay, honey?

Sure, where have you been?
Ooh, Herbie, Mr. Kringelein,

the hotel manager--
he tried-- he tried to--

Again?

Well, I had to do something.

Herbie, don't you dare
apologize to him.

Where's Louise?

Fat lot you care.
Child has her birthday.

Does she like her present?I'm surprised you remembered.

Where have you been?
That's what I want to know.

Rose, this is
Mr. Goldstone.

I ask you, Mr. Goldstone--

Child has a birthday
once a year.

We plan a nice little party.

Sorry the cake is so small.

Mr. Goldstone is
from the Orpheum circuit.

There's only one egg roll apiece
and some fried rice and--

The act is booked on the
Orpheum circuit, Rose.

June, hand me
Louise's plate.

Mother...

We're paying for it,
ain't we?

You'll get an ulcer
like Herbie.

Besides, what the dogs
won't eat, we will.

Rose, did it ever occur to
you there might be somebody

in this world who
doesn't like Chinese food?

Don't be silly.
Who?

Don't you
like it, Herbie?

Sure, Rose,
I love it.

Did she?Yes, Mama.

That's a healthy-wealthy
lady-wadie.

Oh, God.Herbie's angry.

Herbie's never angry.
It's bad for his stomach.

Come on, girls, beddie-bye.It's so early.

But you have to audition
for Mr. T.T. Grantziger at
his Palace Theater tomorrow.

You have to look young.

Can I wear a dress?

You'd look old in a dress.

Besides, you
haven't got one.

Good night,
Uncle Herbie.

'Night, June.

Good night, Louise.

Good night,
Herbie.

I'll cold-cream their faces
and be right back.

Rose, the hotel
is two doors away.

Honestly, you behave as
though those girls-- Rose!

We need new silverware.

Herbie...

Herbie, how long is it gonna
take you to get used to me?

How long did it take me
to get used to those coats?

What's the matter with them?
They're very stylish!

Louise is very handy
with a needle.

As the good Lord says,
"an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth,"

and it serves them right
for overcharging.

They can skip the cold
cream for one night.

All this time
we've been together,

and you still stand up for me.

Instead of standing
up to you.

Well, I wanted to have
dinner, just the two of us,

but what was I gonna
do with the girls?

They're just babies.

Rose, no matter
how you dress them,

no matter how you smother
them, they're big girls.

They're almost young women.

They're not and they
never will be.

I'm embarrassed
in front of them.

When are you gonna
you marry me, Rose?

Don't forget our scrapbooks
to Mr. Grantziger's tomorrow.

When are you gonna
quit stalling?

Honey, don't you know
there's a depression?

Of course I know.
I read "Variety."

Don't you know what
it's doing to vaudeville?

Don't you know what the talkies
are doing to vaudeville?

Don't you know I love you?

Do you think I'd
be unfaithful to my
husbands if you didn't?

But I have to think of my
girls and their happiness.

Louise is very happy being
the front end of a cow.

It's better than
being the rear end.

Anyway, she loves animals.

She and June should
both be in school.

And be like other girls--
cook and clean and sit and die.

Honey, could I have
a spoon to stir my tea?

I promised June she'd be
a star and she will be.

I promised her I'd get her on
the Pantages circuit and I did.

I promised I'd get her on the
Orpheum circuit and I did.

I did.

And you promised me that
after I did, you'd marry me.

I promised her she'd
headline on Broadway.

Didn't you hear what I said?

Yes, but I'm ignoring it.

Thanks, honey.

It isn't very polite
of a gentleman to remind
a lady that she welched.

There was no date
on that promise.

Rose, stop handing
me that bull!

Your stomach.
Oh, Herbie...

Why don't you get angry
on the outside instead

of letting it settle
in your stomach?

I'm afraid.

Of me?

Of me.

What do you mean?

if I ever let loose,
it'll end with me

picking up and walking.

Only around the block.

No.

Don't say that.

â™ª You'll

â™ª Never get away from me

â™ª You can climb
the tallest tree â™ª

â™ª I'll be there somehow

â™ª True, you could say

â™ª Hey, here's your hat

â™ª But a little thing like that

â™ª Couldn't stop me now

â™ª I

â™ª Couldn't get away from you

â™ª Even if you told me to

â™ª So go on and try

â™ª Just try

â™ª And you're gonna see

â™ª How you're gonna
not at all â™ª

â™ª Get away

â™ª From me

Rose, what do you want?

There are better agents.

Not for me.

Even weaker men.

Not for me.

Then what?

You.

Herbie, just keep helping me
like you've been helping.

Just let me get June's
name up in lights so big,

it'll last my whole life.

Rose, what you expect...I'll get!

And after I get it,
I promise I'll marry you.

I even promise
to keep my promise.

Oh, Herbie, I don't want
to upset anything before
the audition tomorrow,

including your stomach.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Rose, I love you

â™ª But don't count
your chickens â™ª

â™ª Come dance with me

â™ª I warn you

â™ª That I'm no boy scout

â™ª Relax awhile
Come dance with me â™ª

â™ª So don't think

â™ª That I'm easy pickings

â™ª The music's so nice

â™ª Rose, 'cause I just
may someday â™ª

â™ª Pick up and pack out

â™ª Oh, no, you won't
no, not a chance â™ª

â™ª No arguments
shut up and dance â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª You'll

â™ª Never get away from me

â™ª You can climb
the tallest tree â™ª

â™ª I'll be there somehow

â™ª True, you could say

â™ª Hey, here's your hat

â™ª But a little thing
like that â™ª

â™ª Couldn't stop me now

â™ª I

â™ª Couldn't get away from you

â™ª Even if I wanted to

â™ª Well, go on and try

â™ª Just try â™ª Ah, Rose

â™ª And you're gonna see â™ª Ah, Rose

â™ª How you're gonna
not at all â™ª

â™ª Get away

â™ª From

â™ª Me â™ª

Yes, Mr. Grantziger.

Yes, I know,
but they're having

a little difficulty
with their scenery.

Well, wait till you see it.

Now keep the tempo up.
Keep it bright.

That's the mother.

No, I have told her.

Hello, Mr. Grantziger.

Where is he?

He's in his office at
the top of the theater.

Hi!

it's a pleasure to audition
for you, Mr. Grantziger.

You're gonna love us!

That's the agent, he's nice.

We're ready now.

Oh, they're ready now,
Mr. Grantziger.

Good luck.Thank you.

June!

Hello, everybody.

My name is June.

What's yours?

â™ª I have a moo cow

â™ª A new cow, a true cow

â™ª Named Caroline â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª She's an extra-special
friend of mine â™ª

â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª I like everything
about her fine â™ª

â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª She likes to moo

â™ª In the moonlight

â™ª When the moody moon appears

â™ª And when she moos

â™ª In the moonlight

â™ª Gosh, it's moosic to my ears

â™ª She's so moosical

â™ª She loves a man cow, a tan cow
who can cow her â™ª

â™ª With a glance â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª When he winks at her
she starts to dance â™ª

â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª It's what grown-ups call
a real romance â™ª

â™ª Moo moo moo moo

â™ª But if we mooved
to the city â™ª

â™ª Or we settled by the shore

â™ª She'd make the moove

â™ª 'Cause she loves me more

â™ªâ™ª

Yes, Mr. Grantziger.

Dainty June, will you
come out for a minute?

Face front, dear.

Profile.

Thank you very much, that's all.

But we have a great
dramatic finish.

I'm sure,

But, Mr. Grantziger--Ah, hit it!

Stop that music!â™ª Broadway

â™ª Broadway

â™ª We miss it so

â™ª We're leaving soon

â™ª I've got my act

â™ª So all aboard, come on,
let's go â™ª

Let's go!

Bye! Bye! Bye!

Watch this!
It's a train!

Whoo whoo!

Goodbye, Caroline.

Don't forget to write.

Bye!

Goodbye, Caroline.

Goodbye.

Goodbye!

â™ªâ™ª

Wait.

Stop the train.

Stop everything.

I can't go to
Broadway with you.

Why not, Dainty June?

Because...

everything in life
that really matters

is right here.

What care I for tinsel

or glamour

when I have friendship

and true love?

I'm staying here with Caroline!

Yay!

â™ªâ™ª

Yes, Mr. Grantziger.

What?

He liked it.

Yes, sir, if that's
what you want.

If you and your tribe will
follow me up to the office,

I'll make out the contracts.

You won't be sorry,
Mr. Grantziger!

This is gonna make ya!

Yes?

No, Mr. Grantziger's busy.
He's gone down to the stage.

Your mother and your
agent are still reading
over the contracts.

They won't be much longer.

She's got to eat sometime.

Say, woman to woman...

How old are you?Nine.

Nine what?

Nine, going on 10.

How long has that
been going on?

Miss Cratchitt, I think
Mr. Grantziger made
a mistake in this contract.

So do I.

Happy, girls?

Yes, Mama.No!

We auditioned for
Grantziger's Palace.

This is for
Grantziger's Variety.

That's right.

But the Variety's way
down on 14th street.

He'll give you
a visa to get there.

Yes?

I'd like to talk
to Mr. Grantziger.

No, I told you he's gone
down to the stage.

Then I'm going down
to the stage.

Wait a minute, you
can't disturb him

while he's holding
auditions.

Then I'll wait.

Listen, friend,
strictly between us,

if I were you,
I'd sign that contract.

There's only one item in that
act of yours the boss likes--

Dainty little June.

He thinks she can
be an actress.

He's right.

Can be if...

If what?

If she goes to school
for a solid year

and takes acting lessons.

He's ready to pay for
everything...

On one condition.

You stay away.

Stay away? I'm her mother.

You said it, I didn't.

What about the act?

One week at the Variety.

But June is the act.

How is it supposed to go
on without her?

How are Louise and
I supposed to live?

You might get a job, dear.

I have a job, dear,
and I do it damn well.

My daughters are my job,
and I got two of them.

Mama, if June has--

June is my baby.
I'm her mother.

Don't you dare answer that
phone when I'm yelling at you.

Nobody knows June like I do.

And no one can do
for her what I can.

Mama, this is my chance
to be an actress.

Mr. Grantziger can
make me a star.

You are a star!

And I made you one!

Who's got clippings
like she does?

Look, the book's full of 'em.

She don't need lessons
any more than she needs
Mr. T.T. Grantziger.

There isn't a person
in show business who doesn't
need Mr. Grantziger.

Then take a good
look at this person.

Rose!

Oh, they're so smart
in New York.

New York is the center of--

New York is the center
of New York!

There's a whole country full of
people who know people,

who know what a mother
means to her daughter.

It's hicks like you
that don't know.

And I'll tell you
something else.

Grantziger's a hick.
He'll get no place!

Rose!

He's trying to take
my baby away from me!

That's what
he's trying to do.

Well, over my dead body he will.

Rose, come on now.Just a minute!

Just wait one minute.

No!

Mama's just talking big, June.

She won't really--Yes, she will.

Well, Maybe
Mr. Grantziger will--

No, he won't.

Well, that's show business.

Aren't you happy that someone
like Mr. T .T. Grantziger

thinks that you can be a star?

You're funny.

Why?

Well, you're never jealous.

Oh, well, I don't
have any talent.

I don't mind, really,

except Mama would
like it better if I did.

Guess that's what
she likes about me.

Mama's no fool.

I'm not a star.

Oh, you are.I'm not!

Mr. Grantziger can make me one.

Mama can make
you a star, too.

Mama can do one thing:

she can make herself believe
anything she makes up,

like with that rhinestone finale
dress that you sewed for me.

Mama wants publicity,
so she makes up a story

that three nuns went blind
sewing it.

And now she believes it.

She even believes
the act is good.

Isn't it?

It's a terrible act
and I hate it.

I've hated it from
the beginning.

And I hate it even more now.

I hate pretending
like I'm two years old.

I hate singing those
same awful songs,

doing those same awful dances,

wearing these
same awful costumes.

Well, I didn't mean it
about the costumes.

No, you just meant that
you're too big for them now.

Did you ever feel like
you didn't have a sister?

Sometimes.

It's Mama's fault!

You can't blame
everything on Mama.

Well, you can't maybe.

I wish she'd marry Herbie
and let me alone.

Herbie doesn't want marry her.

All he cares about is the act.

Oh, honest, Louise.

Well, he's an agent.

Your mother isn't
feeling well.

I'll take her back
to the hotel.

Don't worry, June.

I'll get you a good booking.

I wish Mama would
marry a plain man,

so we could all be together.

â™ª If Mama was married
we'd live in a house â™ª

â™ª As private as private can be

â™ª Just Mama, three ducks,
five canaries, a mouse â™ª

â™ª Two monkeys, one father

â™ª Six turtles and me

â™ª If Mama was married

â™ª If Mama was married
I'd jump in the air â™ª

â™ª And give all
my toe shoes to you â™ª

â™ª I'd get all those
hair ribbons out of my hair â™ª

â™ª And once and for all

â™ª I'd get Mama out, too

â™ª If Mama was married

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Mama

â™ª Get out your white dress

â™ª You've done it before

â™ª Without much success

â™ª Mama

â™ª Godspeed and God bless

â™ª We're not keeping score

â™ª What's one more or less?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Oh, Mama, say yes

â™ª And waltz down the aisle
while you may â™ª

â™ª I'll gladly support you

â™ª I'll even escort you

â™ª And I'll gladly
give you away â™ª

â™ª Oh, Mama

â™ª Get married today

â™ª If Mama was married

â™ª There wouldn't be any more

â™ª Let me entertain you

â™ª Let me make you smile

â™ª I will do some kicks

â™ª I will do some tricks Sing out, Louise!

Smile, baby.

â™ª Mama

â™ª Please take our advice

â™ª We aren't the Lunts

â™ª I'm not Fanny Brice

â™ª Mama
we'll buy you the rice â™ª

â™ª If only this once

â™ª You wouldn't think twice

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª It could be so nice

â™ª If Mama got married

â™ª To stay

â™ª But Mama gets married

â™ª And â™ª Married

â™ª And Married â™ª

â™ª And never gets
carried away â™ª

â™ª Oh, Mama

â™ª Oh, Mama

â™ª Oh, Mama

â™ª Get married today

That's pretty fancy
footwork, Tulsa.

Why don't you show
it to Madam Rose?

I'm not that good, Herbie.
I'm just fooling around.

Tulsa, you started fooling
around about three months ago,

right after Mr. Grantziger
canceled our booking.

Well, I

He's just had more
time, that's all,

like that two-week
layoff in Albany.

And the layoff in Rochester.

And the layoff
in Niagara Falls.Sure, Herbie.

I thought you were maybe
worried about the act.

Oh, no, Herbie.

because the way things
are picking up,

why, I wouldn't be surprised
if you kids got paid.

Matter of fact,

they're good enough right
now for me to treat you

to an ice cream soda.

No, thank you.

Chow mein?

Mama doesn't like us
to eat before a show.

Louise, there's one
thing your mama knows.

I wish you did.

I like her.

Herbie.

Uh... uh...

Nothing.

Tulsa, if you or the boys
have any problems,

you bring them to me.

Sure, Herbie.

You didn't tell
him anything, did you?

I mean, that you're
rehearsing
a dance

How'd you know I was
rehearsing an act?

I saw you practicing on
Monday after the matinee

with a broom for your partner.
I was up in the flies.

Louise, please, just--Oh, I won't tell
anybody, Tulsa.

I promise.

I'm very secretive, like you.

That's what this means,
here in your palm.

And this means that you
make up dreams, like me.

What do you make
up dreams about?

People.

Oh, I do that, too.

You, but yours are about
a partner for your act.

She's gonna be more
than a partner, I hope.

I mean, I dream
that one day...

Well, you know.

What would she have
to be like, Tulsa?

A wonderful singer
and dancer, I guess.

No, I'm gonna do
most of that myself.

I don't mean I'm gonna
hog it all, but...

But they always look
at the girl in a dance team,

especially if she's pretty.

Oh, makeup can
help and costumes.

I've got the costumes
all figured out.

I'll sew them for you.Okay!

Hey, thanks!

Well, you see, I pretend

I'm at home getting
ready for a date.

I take a comb, comb my hair,

take a flower, smell it,

put it in my lapel,

and I spot the audience.

â™ª Once my clothes were shabby

â™ª Tailors called me "cabby"

â™ª So I took a vow

â™ª Said this bum'll be
Beau Brummel â™ª

â™ª Now I'm smooth and snappy

â™ª Now my tailor's happy

â™ª I'm the cat's meow

â™ª My wardrobe is a wow

â™ª Paris silk

â™ª Harris tweed

â™ª There's only
one thing I need â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Got my tweed pressed

â™ª Got my best vest

â™ª All I need now

â™ª Is the girl

â™ª Got my striped tie

â™ª Got my hopes high

â™ª Got the time and the place
and I got rhythm â™ª

â™ª Now all I need's
the girl to go with them â™ª

â™ª If she'll just appear

â™ª We'll take this big town

â™ª For a whirl

â™ª And if she'll say

â™ª "My darling, I'm yours"
I'll throw away â™ª

â™ª My striped tie

â™ª And my best-pressed tweed

â™ª All I really need

â™ª Is the girl

I start easy, see?

Now I'm more debonair.

Break.

And I sell it here.

I start this step.

Build it, double it!

And she appears,
all in white.

I take her hand...

kiss it,

and lead her on the floor.

This step's good
for the costume.

Astaire bit.

â™ª Now we waltz

â™ª Strings come in...

And I lift her.

Again.

Once more.

Now the tempo changes

and all the lights come up,

and I build for the finale!

Hey, that's it, Louise.
Do it over here.

Follow me.

Faster.

Charleston... again!

Once more.

Give me your hands.

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, come on.

[Herbie speaking,
distant train whistle]

Don't lower yourself
to argue, Herbie.

If them rats want to quit,
then let them quit.

They want their
train tickets back--

give them their
bus tickets back.

What's keeping those girls?

There's plenty of time, Rose.

And you say they're old enough
to take care of themselves.

Look, fellows, I know
we've had a couple of layoffs.

It ain't that, Herbie.Then what is it?

We're too old.

Would you be too old
if Madam Rose and I

could see our way clear
to increasing your salary?

Increase what salary?

Herbie's been paying us.Moron.

Herbie.

How long is it gonna take you
to get used to me, Rose?

Button your coat.

Ingrates.

You take the bread
out of this man's mouth

and spit it right in his face.

Well, as the good Lord said,
good riddance to bad rubbish.

Give them their tickets, Herbie.

They were both
rotten in the act anyway.

Okay.

Thanks, Herbie.

We'd like tickets
for all the fellas.

All the fellas?They asked us.

You're all leaving?Yes, sir, Herbie.

Something's funny.

Something's very funny here.

Why, Yonkers?

What's this all about?

Okay, if you're all going,
you're all going, but why

Where have you been?
Where's June?

Louise, where's June?

Don't give me
any of your poems to read now.

Answer me.

June wrote this, to you.

What for?

What's she writing me for?

Mama, read it.

She eloped.
She didn't elope, stupid.

They got married
three weeks ago.

Who got married?

June and Tulsa.
June?

Only they had to wait until
their act was ready

before they took off.

It's a keen act,
ain't it, Louise?

I've never seen it.

We ain't rats, Herbie.

We just know that
without June--

Where'd they go
Well, first they got

a club date in Kansas.
Big mouth.

Can we have
the tickets now?

Please, Herbie.
We've got to get moving.

See, we fixed up an act--Here.

Get moving.

Don't be sore, Herbie.

It ain't our fault
the act's all washed up.

Hey, fellas,

Good luck.

Thanks, Herbie.
Good luck to you.

Good luck, Louise.

Good luck.

Good luck, Madam Rose.

Come on, L.A.

Rose,

honey, even if we--

Honey, listen, I can go back
in the candy business.

It's steady.

52 weeks,
all year, every year,

I'll work my fingers
to the bone.

I'll do twice what I did before,
and I was pretty fair.

See, I could be
a district manager

and we can stay put
in one place.

Louise can go to school.

Rose?

Rose, honey,
you still got Herbie.

You can marry me,
and I promise you,

you won't have one single worry
the rest of your life.

Don't you want that?

Yes.

Oh, mama, say yes.

Herbie.

You read palms.
I read minds.

Okay, honey.

Honey, it's gonna be fine.

Everything happens for the best.

Okay, so the act's finished,

but you and me
and our daughter--

we're gonna have a home.

Say, we even got a cow
for the backyard.

Why, we are gonna be
the best damn family ever was.

I'm used to people
walking out.

When my own mother did it,
I cried for a week.

Your father did it.

Then the man I married after him
did it.

And, well,

this time I ain't crying.

This time I'm apologizing

to you.

I pushed you aside for her.

I made everything
just for her.

No, Mama.

Now she says I can't make her
an actress

like she wants to be.

The boys walked because
they think the act is finished.

They think we're nothing
without her.

She's nothing without me.

I'm her mother,
and I made her.

And I can make you now.

I'm gonna make it up to you

for all the years
I pushed you in the back.

And I will, my baby,
I swear I will.

I'm gonna make you a star.

I'm gonna build a whole new act
all around you.

It's gonna be better than
anything we ever did before,

better than anything
we've even dreamed.

Rose, listen--You're right, Herbie.

It is for the best.

The old act
was getting stale and tired,

but the new one--

Look at the new star.

She's gonna be beautiful.
She is beautiful.

Finished? We're just beginning,

and there's no stopping us
this time.

â™ª I had a dream

â™ª A dream about you, baby

â™ª It's gonna come true, baby

â™ª They think that
we're through â™ª

â™ª But, baby

â™ª You'll be swell

â™ª You'll be great

â™ª Gonna have the whole world
on a plate â™ª

â™ª Starting here
starting now â™ª

â™ª Honey, everything's

â™ª Coming up Roses

â™ª Clear the decks

â™ª Clear the tracks

â™ª You've got nothing to do
but relax â™ª

â™ª Blow a kiss
take a bow â™ª

â™ª Honey, everything's

â™ª Coming up Roses

â™ª Now's your inning

â™ª Stand the world
on its ear â™ª

â™ª Set it spinning

â™ª That'll be
just the beginning â™ª

I talk about is due â™ª

â™ª Honey, everything's

â™ª We can do it

â™ª Mama is gonna see to it

â™ª Curtain up

â™ª We got nothing to hit
but the heights â™ª

â™ª I can tell

â™ª Wait and see

â™ª There's the bell

â™ª Follow me

â™ª And nothing's gonna stop us
till we're through â™ª

â™ª Honey, everything's
coming up Roses and daffodils â™ª

â™ª Everything's coming up
sunshine and Santa Claus â™ª

â™ª Everything's gonna be
bright lights and lollipops â™ª

â™ª Everything's coming up Roses

â™ª For me
and for you... â™ªâ™ª

Are you ready, Louise?

Yes, mama.

Ready, girls?

Yes, Madam Rose.

Now, don't let the past
discourage you.

Remember, you are
artistes of the theater.

Madam Rose's Toreadorables.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Extra! Extra!

â™ª Hey, look at the headline

â™ª Historical news
is being made â™ª

â™ª Extra! Extra!

â™ª They're drawing a red line

â™ª Around the biggest scoop
of the decade â™ª

â™ª A barrel of charm

â™ª A fabulous thrill

â™ª The biggest little headline
in Vaudeville... â™ª

Now sell it.
Sell it.

Presenting

in person

that 5'4" bundle of dynamite,

Senorita

Louise!

Come on, Louise.
Come on.

OlÃ©,everybody.

My name is Louise.

What's yours?

Well, it's coming along.

Mama, I'm just no good at it.

Don't be silly.
Let's try the finale.

If you have a good,
strong finish,

they'll forgive you
for anything.

You're late.

Come on now, girls.

Make it stirring.

â™ªâ™ª

Pick your feet up, Louise.

Pick them up.

â™ªâ™ª

They're tired.

You'd better go on up
to the tent, girls,

and get ready for bed.

Good night, Madam Rose.

Good night, Madam Rose.

Good night, Louise.

Don't forget to write your
mothers for money.

How'd you make out in town?

Not even a lodge hall.

They're too damn un-American
down here,

that's the trouble.

We'd better talk about
heading up north

after I tell them
their bedtime story.

Once upon a time there was
a prince named Ziegfeld.

It could happen.

Anyway, everybody needs
something impossible
to hope for.

Rose, why do you make Louise
wear that wig in the act?

It makes her look more like--

Makes her look
more like a star.

Why do we keep that cow?

Herbie, if that cow goes,
I go.

Oh, the act can be fixed.

If I was doing it for June,
it would be all set.

But you're not.

And I'm not June.

Now, Louise,
nobody expects you to--

Mama, I love you so much,

and I've tried
as hard as I could,

but the act is rotten
and I'm rotten in it.

How do you like that?
Typical of a kid.

Mama, I've been--Always impatient.

A few break-in dates
don't go so hot--

Mama, I am not June,
and I am not a blonde.

I can't do what she did.She isn't asking you to.

Maybe you want to stay
in show business--

Maybe?Well, I thought--

That's our whole life.

What have we been working for
ever since you were a baby?

That's a foolish remark
from a foolish girl.

I promised my girl
she'd be a star,
and she will be.

Baby, I've been on the wrong
track with you and the material,

but as the good lord says,

"You gotta take the rough
with the smooth," baby.

And like I always say,

you're lucky, because you don't
have to take it alone.

Right, Herbie?

Right.

We got Herbie for brains.

We got you for talent.

And you both got me
to yell at.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Wherever we go

â™ª Whatever we do

â™ª We're gonna go through it

â™ª Together

â™ª We may not go far

â™ª But sure as a star

â™ª Wherever we are

â™ª It's together

â™ª Wherever I go

â™ª I know he goes

â™ª Wherever I go

â™ª I know she goes

â™ª No fits, no fights

â™ª No feuds
and no egos â™ª

â™ª Amigos

â™ª Together

â™ª Through thick
and through thin â™ª

â™ª All out or all in

â™ª And whether it's win
place or show â™ª

â™ª With you for me
and me for you â™ª

â™ª We'll muddle through
whatever we do â™ª

â™ª Together

â™ª Wherever we go

â™ª Wherever we go

â™ª Whatever we do

â™ª We're gonna go through it

â™ª Together

â™ª Wherever we sleep

â™ª If prices are steep

â™ª We'll always sleep
cheaper together â™ª

â™ª Whatever the boat I row
you row â™ª

â™ª A duo

â™ª Whatever the row I hoe
you hoe â™ª

â™ª A trio

â™ª And any I.O.U. I owe
you owe â™ª

â™ª Who, me owe?
No, you owe â™ª

â™ª No, we owe

â™ª Together

â™ª We all take the bow

â™ª Including the cow

â™ª Though business is lousy
and slow â™ª

â™ª With Herbie's vim

â™ª Louise's verve

â™ª Now all we need

â™ª Is someone with nerve

â™ª Together

â™ª Together

â™ª Wherever

â™ª Wherever

â™ª Together

â™ª Wherever

â™ª Together wherever we go

Here are the letters,
Madam Rose.

That's a good girl.
Now go to bed, Agnes.

Now that I'm an actress,
it's Amanda.

Whatever it is, go to bed.

Can I ask Herbie
a question first?

Sure.

Herbie, do you think
we'll ever work again?

Of course we will.I'll get us a booking, Amanda.

Thank you, Herbert.

Louise, your hair.

It's yours if you want it.

Gee, I always wanted to be
a blonde.

Then get some peroxide
and a toothbrush.

Wigs are expensive.

Say, we could get a good refund
on this,

if we ever pay for it.

How about getting
a gallon of peroxide

and a carton of toothbrushes?

What for?Make them all blondes.

I was only joking, Herbie.

So was I, honey.Yes, but why not do it?

They're children, Louise.

They're young girls, mama.

And with blonde hair, they could
be pretty young girls.

It'd sure jazz up the act
and make it easier to sell.

We could call it "Madam Rose
and Her Blonde Babies ."

"Baby Blondes."Nothing with babies.

"Hollywood Blondes."
Yes.

All blondes except you,
because you're the star.

If I'm the star,

then it should be

"Louise...

and Her Hollywood Blondes ."

"Rose-Louise

and Her Hollywood Blondes."

Okay.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª We go in a group

â™ª We tour in a troupe

â™ª We land in the soup
but we know â™ª

â™ª The things we do
we do by threes â™ª

â™ª A perfect team
No, this way, Louise â™ª

â™ª Together

â™ª Together

â™ª Wherever

â™ª Wherever

â™ª Together wherever we go â™ª

It's a real live theater.

With a real live stage.

Oh, Marjorie May,
we've arrived at last.

Louise, look!A real live theater.

Kill that flood.

It's just like opening day
rehearsals used to be.

Mama's gonna love it.

Will you kill that flood?

Will you shut your hole?

She isn't gonna love that.

Or that.

â™ªâ™ª

What kind of an act
is that?

Okay, jailbait.
You the Hollywood Blondes?

Yes--You're late.

Our car broke down--Skip it.

Now some of you dogs
can use this dressing room.

The rest-- the one up there.

This one you share with
Tessie Tura the Texas Twirler.

My mother doesn't--That one with Mazeppa,

Revolution in Dance.

Shake it up.

Oh...

So you're the act that's
supposed to keep the cops out?

You must be lousy.

It's a real live theater,
all right.

He reminds me
of my brother.

Oh, Amanda, don't start
sniveling now.

Come on, grab the cow

and anything else
you can carry and go in there.

Marjorie May, why don't you take
the other girls

into the second room
and start unpacking?

All right, come on,
let's wrap this rehearsal.

Ooh.

Look at this.

That Tessie Tura must be
a very fancy lady.

She must also be a pig.

Louise.I'm here, Mama.

Here, let me help you.

Louise, we're back
in a theater, a real theater.

Mama, where's Herbie?

He went out front
to check the billing.

Good morning.

Oh, no, no, no.

Oh, it ain't weighted right,
damn it.

It scratches the hell out of me

and it just don't bump
when I do.

Maybe there's something wrong
with your bumper.

Big joke.

I'm out there bumping
my brains off with no action,

and she's being witty.

Hey, you with the neck.

I paid six bucks
for that g-string.

Now back where you found it.

Yes, ma'am.

Get the bags.

Get the props.
Get the cow.

Now, mama--

You don't know what kind
of people these are.

You don't know
what kind of a theater this is.

Yes, I do. It's a house
of burlesque.

A house of burlesque.
Do you know what that is?

Filth, that's what.

I tell you when your friend
Herbie shows his face--

Mama, I'm sure
Herbie didn't know.

Not much, he didn't.
Agnes!

He did the booking
over the telephone.
Agnes!

Mama, we were all so happy.Agnes, damn it.

Madam Rose, you know
my name isn't Agnes anymore.

...Agnes, I want you
and the rest of those girls

out of this hellhole
in two seconds flat.

But, Madam Rose--March!

Yes, ma'am.

Wait in the other room.

I'll take the front end
of the cow, you take the rear.

And what bags we can't carry,
your friend Herbie can

damn well pick up
and carry by himself.

Now you listen to me, Louise.

Just because you think
your friend Herbie--

This has nothing
to do with Herbie.

You don't know
what burlesque is.

Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

No daughter of mine is ever
working in burlesque,

and no daughter
of any woman I know.

Then, Mama, where are we
going to work?

I'd rather starve.

Mama, how much money
do we have?

Including what's left
of their allowances,

how much do we have?

Something will turn up.Well, something has turned up,

and this is it.

Mama, we're flat broke.

We've got to take this job.

Even if you wanted to quit
and go home right now,

we'd have to take this job.

I had a dream.

Mama.

Oh, you'll like this one.

I had it over a week ago,
only I didn't want to tell.

I was home in Seattle

and the cow came into my room.

Only this time she wasn't
dancing and smiling.

She was wheezing and sadlike.

She came right over to my bed,
looked at me, and said,

"Rose, move over."

I'm sorry, Mama.

Why?

She didn't ask you
to move over.

No, I mean I'm sorry I'm not
good enough

in the act.

Oh, it's the act
that ain't good enough, baby.

Rose?In here, Herbie.

Rose, I didn't know,
believe me.

I do, honey.

What the hell?

It's only two weeks.
The money is good.

Maybe by that time
something will turn up, right?

Right.You're a nice girl, Rose.

Thank you.That's show business.

One good thing-- I bet
we got top billing.

No. We're featured, though.

Second?

Actually they had us
lost in the middle.

I thought last was better,
and so it says,

"and Rose-Louise and
Her Hollywood Blondes."

and I'm making them
put a box around it.

They'll use a lot of pictures.

Forget the box, Herbie.
Forget the pictures.

But, Mama, if--You don't know what they say
in the business,

but Herbie does.

They say once a Vaudeville act
plays in burlesque,

that means it's all washed up.

Nothing's gonna turn up for us,
is it, Herbie?

No.

I guess it is
a pretty rotten act.

It ain't the act, honey.

I've been telling you,
Vaudeville's dead,

stone-cold dead.

Well, we sure as hell tried.We sure as hell did.

Nobody can say we didn't last
right up to the very end.

Sure as hell can't.Right?

Right.

Well, I'd better get
the cues ready.

Herbie...

...how about marrying me?

Sure.

I love you, you know.

I know.

Do it today.

Not while we're in burlesque.

The day we close.

It's a deal.

Oh, Herbie.
I do, honey, I do.

So do I, Rose.Hey, Rose-Louise,

where the hell is your music
and light cues?

Be right with you.You Rose

Yeah, I'm Rose-Louise.Things are looking up.

Well, I got a show to open,
Rose-Louise, so move your ass.

Listen, you little punk,
for the next two weeks

you're gonna speak like
a Sunday school teacher.

You got something
in this theater

you've never seen before--
a lady.

Look at her.
That is a lady.

That is also a lady.

Every girl in this damn act

is a lady, you understand?Yes, sir.

Now go onstage and I'll give you
those cues when I'm ready.

Yes, sir.
Excuse me, ma'am.

Oh, sir.

Won't you give me
your protection?

I'm a lady, too.

Hey, the damn thing worked!

Well, if you ladies
will excuse me...

We're very busy.

In my dressing room.

In your dress--
Mama.

You're damn right it is.

And I don't like sharing it
any more than you do,

particularly with a troupe
of professional virgins.

We are not--
All right.

So you're acrobats.

We happen to be headliners
from the Orpheum circuit.

We were booked into this theater
by mistake.

Weren't we all?

Say, who made that?
I did.

I make all our costumes.

Will you look at them ladylike
little stitches?

That miserable broad
who's been making my gowns

must be using a fishhook.

What do you pay her?

25 bucks a gown
and I provide the material.

30.But she's new in the business.

30.
Who are you?
Her mother?

Yes.
30.

I'll get the material
after the matinee.

It's a deal.

Where's your toreador costume?The girls must have it in--

God knows what else they've got
in that dressing room with them.

You know,

from the way that dame walks,

she would have made a damn good
stripper in her day.

Hey, Tessie, I'm short
a talking woman.

Tough titty.

Tessie, the new comic
won't use a chorus girl.

Let him use Mazeppa.
Everyone else has.

Now, you know Mazeppa's got
a gladiator ballet

just before his spot.

Then cut the ballet.
It stinks anyway.

Oh, be a sport.
I'm in a bind.

You're always in a bind
in this flee-bitten trap.

I'm a strip woman, slob.

I don't do no scenes.
Now screw.

Have you ever heard of
a first-class strip woman

playing scenes?

Well, you play stock
in a dump like this,

you gotta expect to be insulted.

The work's steady,
ain't it?

Yeah, but you bring in a new
star for each show, don't you?

Tessie, it's just a few lines.

Fat boy,

save your bad breath.

I'll give you
10 bucks extra.
Nah.

Excuse me.

I can read lines.And who are you?

Rose-Louise of Rose-Louise
and Her Hollywood Blondes.

Wait a minute.

What kind of lines?

You in her act?

Not exactly.

Shut up.
How are your legs?

Great, and I'll learn her
the scenes.

Okay, 10 bucks.

It's money, Mama.

What's she going to be saying
out there on that stage?

The same burlesque crap that's
been said since the year one.

Say, where have you been
all your life?

Playing Vaudeville.

Where

You name a big city
and we've played it.

My grandfather says
we've covered the country
like gypsies.

Well, you may be a gypsy,
Rose-Louise--

Say, that ain't a bad name
if you ever take up stripping.

She won't.

No, but you let her feed lines
to a bum comic

for a lousy 10 bucks.

That's training.

She's going to be an actress.

This is only temporary.

As soon as she finishes here,

she goes right back
to Vaudeville.

Back to Vaudeville, my eye.

There ain't any Vaudeville left
except burlesque.

We know.

You know?

You better wise her up.

She's wise.

She's a damn sight wiser
than any of you.

Like mother, like daughter.

Okay.

It's okay, baby.

Say,

whose feelings did I hurt?

Yours or hers?

Neither.

We'll both be fine.

That's good, because sharing
a dressing room

is like sleeping together.

If you don't get along with
one another--

Miss Tura!

Miss Tura.

I will thank you not to give
the boss any notion

that I would ever play scenes.

One more disparaging remark
about my ballet

will find this bugle
right up your--

Please.

There is a lady present.

Where?

Open your eyes
instead of your mouth.

Gypsy,

meet Miss Mazeppa
and Miss Electra.

Say, you're even younger
than I was

when I began stripping.

Oh, I'm not going to strip.

Something wrong
with stripping?

No, I just meant that
I don't have any talent.

You think they have?

I myself, of course,
was a ballerina.

But take it from me,
to be a stripper,

all you need to have
is no talent.

You'll pardon me,

but to have no talent
is not enough.

What you need to have
is an idea

that makes your strip special.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª You can pull
all the stops out â™ª

â™ª Till they call the cops out

â™ª Grind your behind
till you're banned â™ª

â™ª But you got to get a gimmick

â™ª If you want to get a hand

â™ª You can sacrifice your sacro

â™ª Working in the back row

â™ª Bump in a dump
till you're dead â™ª

â™ª Kid, you got to get
a gimmick â™ª

â™ª If you want to get ahead

â™ª You can uh

â™ª You can uh

â™ª You can uh uh uh

â™ª That's how burlesque
was born â™ª

â™ª So I uh

â™ª And I uh

â™ª And I uh uh uh

â™ª But I do it
with a horn... â™ª

â™ª Once I was a schlepper

â™ª Now I'm Miss Mazeppa

â™ª With my revolution
in dance â™ª

â™ª You got to have a gimmick

â™ª If you want to have
a chance â™ª

â™ª She can uh

â™ª She can uh

â™ª She can uh uh uh

â™ª They'll never make her rich

â™ª Me, I ooh

â™ª And I ooh

â™ª And I ooh ooh ooh

â™ª But I do it

â™ª With a switch...

Ooh!

â™ª I'm electrifyin'

â™ª And I ain't even tryin'

â™ª I never have to sweat
to get paid â™ª

â™ª 'Cause if you got a gimmick

â™ª Gypsy, girl
you've got it made â™ª

â™ª All them ooh

â™ª And them ooh

â™ª And them ooh ooh ooh

â™ª Ain't gonna spell success

â™ª Me, I hmm

â™ª And I hmm

â™ª And I hmm hmm hmm

â™ª But I do it with finesse...

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Dressy Tessie Tura

â™ª Is so much more demurer

â™ª Than all them other ladies
because â™ª

â™ª You got to get a gimmick

â™ª If you want
to get applause â™ª

â™ª Do something special

â™ª Anything that's fresh'll

â™ª Earn you
a big fat cigar â™ª

â™ª Earn you a big fat cigar

â™ª Earn you a big fat cigar

â™ª You're more
than just a mimic â™ª

â™ª When you've got a gimmick

â™ª Take a look
how different we are â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª If you want to make it

â™ª Twinkle while you shake it

â™ª If you want to grind it

â™ª Wait till you've refined it

â™ª If you want to bump it

â™ª Bump it with a trumpet

â™ª Get yourself a gimmick
and you too â™ª

â™ª Can be a star â™ª

Go to flood
and bring in number four.

I told you we ain't using
number four in this show,

you pinhead.Hey, you seen Amanda?

She must be packing.

Ain't your act through today?

You bet it is--
through, finished, over.

Hey, I've been hunting
all over for you.

Here.

Oh, Herbie.

It's like for a funeral.

It's for the wedding.

Madam Rose and I want you to be
bridesmaid, Amanda.

No, it's Agnes again.

You'll be happier
as Agnes, Amanda.

Oh, you're leaving?

Yeah, I have to go home
and let my hair grow out.

Oh, you poor kid.

Come on, Tessie.

Shake it up.

Well, for the last time--

â™ª Meet you
around the corner... â™ª

â™ª In a half hour â™ª

Oh...

Tessie!Tessie.

I'm coming, you creep.

And now, Miss Tessie Tura.

Why aren't you nervous?

I've never been so nervous
in my whole life.

You've never been
married before.

Well, your mother's never been
married before

like she's gonna be this time--

for keeps and forever, to me.

Honey, ain't you
a little bit nervous?
Sure.

I don't know why the hell
I stay in this business.

If it ain't one damn headache,
it's another.

Shh, they can hear you
out front.

It's my theater,
ain't it?
Let 'em.

Last show, no talking woman.

The show before that--
no second banana.

If that crazy broad wasn't here,

why did you start
the performance?

She don't go on
till next to closing.

She said she was only going
next door to the drugstore.

What was she arrested for?
Shoplifting?

No, soliciting.

She always was greedy.
Cut the spot.

Do you think we ought to
invite the minister out

for a drink after?

It's the star strip.

Cut it.

They'll yell murder
if it's the same act

they've been seeing
for the past eight weeks.

The star's the novelty.

And what do you want
I should do?

Let you strip?

My daughter can do it.

Rose-Louise.
Since when?

Ever since she's been here to
see how little there is to it.

She didn't look bad
in them scenes.

She'll look great
in her own gowns.

What's the gimmick?

She's young.

And you got any better ideas?

Well, she'd better get ready
right damn quick.

It's the star spot.

You're telling me?

That means the star salary.

If we keep her.

You will.

She's gonna be wonderful.

I knew something would turn up.

Where's that dress
you were gonna make for Tessie?

It will work perfect for you.

Well, come on,
get your makeup on.

There ain't much time.

Oh, silly,

you ain't really gonna strip.

All you'll do is walk around
the stage in time to the music

and drop a shoulder strap
at the end.

You're a lady,
like Herbie says you are.

You'll just parade so grand,

they'll think
you're doing them a big favor

if you even show them your knee.

Louise, it's the star spot.

I always promised my daughter
we'd be a star.

Baby,

it's all right to walk out
when they want you,

but you can't walk out now

when after all these rotten
years we're still a flop.

That's quitting.

We can't quit
because we're a flop.

Louise, don't be like June.

Just do this so we can--

we walk away proud
because we made it--

maybe only in burlesque,

maybe only a second-rate
burlesque at that--

but let's walk away...

a star.

There ain't enough time
to finish the dress,

but we can pin it.

Hey, here's some material
for extra panels.

Didn't I tell you
you were born lucky?

You can unpin them and drop them
every once in a while

so they think
you're taking something off.

Not too much makeup, baby--
young and girlish, pure.

Don't smear that junk all over
your face like they do.

You keep your mouth
the way the lord made it.

No rouge, no beauty marks.

You be a lady--

grand, elegant,

with a classy,
ladylike walk.

Shoes.

Oh, my god, shoes.

Well, you could wear these--

these old silver ones
I borrowed from Tessie.

They'll do for this performance.

Come on, get into them.

Oh, no, your hair's all wrong.

You can't let it just hang there
like spaghetti.

Put it up.

It's got to have class.

Fluff it up
in the front.

Thank God the Lord gave us
good color

and that you
washed it this morning.

Say, maybe we should put in
a couple of feathers, huh?

No, that's what they all do.

Jewelry, jewelry.

No, let Tessie and the others

wear all the vulgar junk
they want.

She almost ready?
She goes on in five minutes.

She'll be there.
She'll be there.

Come on.
Get into the dress.

What are these?

Oh.

My wedding present
from Tessie.

Good for a lady.
Yeah, wear them.

Let's see, what else?

Music!

Hmm, Spanish, cow,
military-- no.

Say--

Say, you can do June's
"Let Me Entertain You" number.

I'll mark it for the conductor
to repeat two choruses slow--

No, 2 1/2 choruses.

And sing out, Louise.

You just walk and dip.
My girl's a lady.

Make them beg for more
and then don't give it to 'em.

Let's see, anything else?

Where you been?
Out front?

No, I got sick to my stomach
and threw up.

But you feel better now?

No.

Herbie, I had to.

That's why I'm leaving.

I apologize.

No, let me,

for my resemblance
to a mouse--

no, to a worm, the way
I've crawled after you.

No more, Rose.
I won't.

I was even going to
crawl away from you

because my stomach
started to turn over at the idea

of coming back and telling you
we're finished.

Tell me tomorrow after
we're married.

We're never getting married.

Sure, we are, first thing
in the morning.

Never! Not if you got down
on your knees and begged.

Oh, I still love you,

but all the vows
from here to doomsday--

they couldn't make you a wife.

I want a wife.

I'm gonna be a man
if it kills me.

So you're killing me.

Nobody can kill you.

You're jealous,

just like every man
I've ever known,

jealous because
my girls come first.

Well, they always did
and they always will.

Then why did June leave?I don't wanna hear her name.

She didn't want the act
any more than Louise wants this.

Louise does.

She'll leave like June did.

Never.

She's gonna be a star.

She's gonna be a star
if it kills you and her.

She's gonna be a star someplace.

Where are you gonna be
when she gets married?

She won't be getting married
for years.

She's a baby.

Sure.

Anyway, her career
will always come first.

That's right.

That is right.

Herbie...

why does everybody walk out?

Maybe Louise won't.

Don't leave, Herbie.

I need you.

What for?

A million things.

Just one would be better.

Goodbye, honey.

Be a good girl.

You go to hell.

Come on, get her music
to the conductor.

And you'd better
stand by me for the light cues.

I just hope you know
what you're doing.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Lucky

â™ª You're a man
who likes children â™ª

â™ª That's an important sign

â™ª Lucky

â™ª I'm a woman

â™ª Funny

â™ª Small

â™ª And funny â™ª

I'll take this to the conductor.

Just remember you're a lady...

...and you are going to be
a star.

Mama, I'm pretty.

I'm a pretty girl, Mama.

She's pretty.

You look beautiful.

Good luck, honey.

Are you nervous?

What?

I said,
are you nervous, baby?

No, Mother.

Wichita's one and only
burlesque theater presents...

Mama?

Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!

Louise.

Go on, baby!

Let's go, honey.

â™ª Let me entertain you...

We can't hear you!

â™ª Let me make you smile...

Sing out, Louise.

â™ª Let me do a few tricks

â™ª Some old and then
some new tricks â™ª

â™ª I'm very versatile

Oh, yeah, but can you dance?

â™ª And if you're real good

â™ª I'll make you feel good

â™ª I want your spirits
to climb â™ª

â™ª So let me

â™ª Entertain you...

Let's see some skin.

â™ª And we'll have
a real good time â™ª

â™ª Yes, sir

â™ª We'll have

â™ª A real good time...

Well, do something.

Dip.

Take something off.

Mama?

Where are you going, honey?

A glove.

Well, say something.

Hello.

Hello.

Come on, cutie.Well?

Everybody...

my name is...

Gypsy...

Rose...

Lee.

What's yours?

Barney.

Sir.

Mr. Conductor, if you please.

â™ª So let me

â™ª Entertain you

â™ª And we'll have
a real good time â™ª

â™ª Yes, sir

â™ª We'll have

â™ª A real good time â™ª

The Alhambra Theater
of Philadelphia

brings you
our featured attraction--

Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Let me

â™ª Entertain you

â™ª Let me

â™ª Make you smile

I'm beginning to like this.

My mother,

who got me into this business...

always told me,

"Make them beg for more

and then don't give it to them."

But I'm not my mother.

So if you beg for more,

I'll give it to you.

â™ª And we'll have
a real good... â™ª

Beg.

The Diamond Burlesque
of Detroit

presents another jewel
in our glittering crown--

Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!

The Old Howard Theater
of Boston

invites all you
floundering fathers

to the most spectacular event--

Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!

What am I going to do
when big hats go out?

Use mine!

And now, Minsky's
World-Famous Burlesque

presents the queen
of the striptease,

the incomparable
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee

in our salute
to the Garden of Eden.

â™ªâ™ª

Pack up your petals, girls,

and back to the garden.

Bonsoir, messieurs

et messieurs.

Je m'appelle

Gypsy

Rose

Lee.

And that concludes my entire
performance in French.

I've been too busy learning...

Greek.

Where were you last night?

Some man accused me

of being
an ecdysiast.

Do you know what that means?

No.

Do you?

No.

Do you
No.

You do.

No.

He's embarrassed.

Don't be embarrassed.

I like men
without hair.

An ecdysiast...

is one who...

or that which...

sheds its skin.

In vulgar parlance...

a stripper.

But I'm not a stripper.

At these prices,

I'm an ecdysiast.

â™ª And if you're real good

â™ª I'll make you
feel good â™ª

â™ª I want your spirits

â™ª To climb

â™ª Let me entertain you

â™ª And we'll

â™ª Have

â™ª A real good
time... â™ªâ™ª

Bravo.

Bravo.

Bravo.

Sure, I saw that sign. Huh!

If I can read the fine print
in our contracts,

I can certainly read letters
two-feet high.

"The mother
of Miss Gypsy Rose Lee

is not allowed backstage
at this theater." Huh!

You want to know
what I did with that sign?

I tore it off the wall,
spread it out on the floor,

and I set Chowsie III
down on it.

That dog's a trouper.
She knew what to do.

It'd take more than signs
to keep me out of a theater.

That comes down.

You need something to remind
you that your goal

was to be a great actress,

not cheap stripper.

June's the actress, Mother.

And I'm not
a cheap stripper.

I'm the highest-paid
in the business.

You won't be ready
when vaudeville comes back.

No, I'll be dead.

Renee, tell Sam he can lock
the animals up for the night.

I'll tell him.Mother, please.

And, Renee, bring in my press
agent as soon as he gets here.

Oui, Madam.

Aren't you going to
take your bath?

Yes, Mother.

Then why are you
fixing your face?

A photographer's coming.

Where's he gonna photograph you?
In the tub?

Eventually.

Louise.

It's for "Vogue."

Louise. Well, I'd better
get out our scrapbooks.

Phil's taken care
of all that.

Phil-- ugh, he's
a rotten press agent.

He never tells them we
headlined the Morpheum Circuit.

I've got it.

Hello.

Hello.

It's difficult right now.

I'm not leaving.

I'll see you at the party.

I promise.

A bientot.

A bienwhat?

I guess I'm being a little
much, but, Mama, I love it.

All right.

Who's giving the party?

Some friends.

In the old days,

I was always invited first.

Well, I wouldn't go even
if I did have something to wear.

I've got more
important things to do,

like thinking up an idea
for a new strip for us.

Mother, we're still stuck with
that wind machine you bought

to blow my clothes off.

Actually, I'm putting in
a new number on Saturday.

What is it?

You'll see.

I'll see?

Let me surprise you.

These days you're just one
big surprise after another.

Well, we have
to go shopping tomorrow

for the material
for the gown.

I've got a French
lesson tomorrow.

Oh, well, I'll go alone.

Any particular color
you have in mind?

Mother, I've already started
making the gown.

Oh.

Well, uh-- hm.

Well, I'd better
run your bath.

You don't have to.
That's what I've got a maid for.

Let me do
something, damn it.

What, Mother?

A million things.

A million things.
I'm not a baby.

Neither am I.

Don't you take
that tone to me.

Your sister used to get
that edge to her voice.

I am not June.

You're not
Louise either.

Neither are you.Oh, yes, I am.

More than you,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee,

with your dirty pictures
for "Vogue"...

Mother, that's--And your maids
and your press agents

and your fancy friends
with their fancy parties.

They happen to be

They laugh at her.

They don't laugh at--They do!

And don't think I don't know
that's one reason

why you don't
want me backstage--

so I won't hear
them laugh.

Well, that's them you ought
to keep out, not me,

because they're
laughing at you, too,

you, the burlesque queen
who speaks lousy French

and reads book reviews
like they was books.

Turn it off, Mother.You know what you are
to them?

A circus freak,
this year's novelty act.

And when the bill
is changed--

I said turn it off.

Nobody laughs at me,
because I laugh first...

at me--

me from Seattle,

me with no education,

me with no talent,

as you've kept reminding me
my whole life.

Well, look at me now--

a star.

Look at how I live.

Look at my friends.

Look at where I'm going.

I'm not staying
in burlesque.

I'm moving.

Maybe up, maybe down,

but wherever it is,
I'm enjoying it.

Mama, I'm having
the time of my life

because for the first time
it is my life.

And I love it.

I love every second of it.

And I'll be damned if you're
going to take it away from me.

I am Gypsy Rose Lee.

And I love her.

And if you don't,
you can clear out right now.

Madam,your press agent is
here with a photographer.

Tell him I'll be ready
in a minute.

Oui, Madam.

Mama, we can't
go shouting

seven performances
of this a week.

The whole family shouts.

It comes from our living
so near the railroad tracks.

I'm getting an ulcer.

You think I'm not?

Yes, I think you're not.

And if you want an ulcer, Mama,
get one of your own.

You can't have mine.

Everybody's got stomach
trouble but me.

Louise, let's forget it.

No, Mama, let's finish it.

I gotta go feed Chowsie.

Mama, you fought
your whole life.

I wish you
could relax now.

You need more mascara
on your left eye.

Mama, you've got to
let go of me.

Let go?

I'll give you
anything you want.

You need me.

A house,
a farm, a school--

a dramatic school
for kids.

You were always
great with kids.

I am a pro,

not an old workhorse
you can turn out to pasture

just 'cause you think you're
riding high on your own.

Mama, no kid does it
all on his own.

But I'm not a kid anymore.

From now on, even if I flop,
I flop on my own.

Hey, Gyps,

what do you say?

"So long, Rose."

That's what she says.

"Don't slam the door
as you leave."

Hello, Rose.

Gyps, baby,

may I present
Monsieur Bougeron

Enchante, Monsieur.

Enchante, Mademoiselle.

Let's make with
the oiseau,kiddies.

Hmm?

One before the plunge.

Fine.

All right, Miss.

Just one thing
I want to know--

all the working and pushing

and finagling,

all the scheming and scrimping,

all the lying
in bed nights

figuring how we're gonna get
from one town to the next,

how do we
all eat on a buck,

how do I make an act
out of nothing--

what did I do it for?

You say I fought
my whole life.

I fought your
whole life.

So tell me now,

what did I do it for?

I thought you did it
for me, Mama.

Come on, smile, Gyps.

Show us your talent.

That's it.

â™ªâ™ª

I thought you did it
for me, Mama.

I thought
you did it for me, Mama.

I thought you made
a no-talent ox into a star

because you like doing things
the hard way, Mama.

And you haven't any talent--

not what I call talent.

Talent for the deaf, dumb,
and blind,maybe!

Not an ounce of it,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.

I made you!

And you want to know why?

You want to know
what I did it for?

Because I was born too soon
and started too late.

That's why.
With what I got in me,

I could have been better
than any of you.

What I got in me,
what I've been holding down

inside of me--

Oh, if I ever let it out,

there wouldn't be signs
big enough.

There wouldn't be
lights bright enough.

Here she is, boys.
Here she is, world.

Here's Rose!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Curtain up

â™ª Light the lights...

Play it, boys.

â™ª You either got it

â™ª Or you ain't

â™ª And, boys, I got it...

You like it?

Yeah!

Well, I got it.

â™ª Some people got it

â™ª And make it pay

â™ª Some people can't even

â™ª Give it away

â™ª This people's got it

â™ª And this people's

â™ª Spreadin' it around

â™ª You either have it

â™ª Or you've had it...

Hello, everybody.

My name is Rose.

What's yours?

How do you like
them egg rolls,

Mr. Goldstone?

â™ª Hold your hats
and hallelujah â™ª

â™ª Mama's gonna
show it to ya â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Ready or not, shh

â™ª Here comes Mama

â™ª Mama's talkin' loud

â™ª Mama's doin' fine

â™ª Mama's gettin' hot

â™ª Mama's goin' strong

â™ª Mama's movin' on

â™ª Mama's all alone

â™ª Mama doesn't care

â™ª Mama's lettin' loose

â™ª Mama's got the stuff

â™ª Mama's lettin' go...

Mama.

â™ª Mama's got the stuff

â™ª Mama's got to move

â™ª Mama's got to go...

Mama.

Mama.

â™ª Mama's got to let go...

â™ª Why did I do it?

â™ª What did it get me?

â™ª Scrapbooks full
of me in the background

â™ª Give 'em love
and what does it get you? â™ª

â™ª What does it get you?
One quick look as each
of 'em leaves you â™ª

â™ª All your life
and what does it get you? â™ª

â™ª "Thanks a lot"
And out with the garbage â™ª

â™ª They take bows
and you're batting zero â™ª

â™ª I had a dream

â™ª I dreamed it for you, June

â™ª It wasn't
for me, Herbie â™ª

â™ª And if it wasn't for me

â™ª Then where
would you be â™ª

â™ª Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?

â™ª Well, someone tell me
when is it my turn? â™ª

â™ª Don't I get a dream
for myself? â™ª

â™ª Starting now
it's gonna be my turn â™ª

â™ª Gangway, world,
get off of my runway â™ª

â™ª Starting now
I bat a thousand â™ª

â™ª This time, boys,
I'm taking the bows and... â™ª

â™ª Everything's
coming up Rose â™ª

â™ª Yeah, everything's
coming up roses â™ª

â™ª Everything's coming up roses
this time for me â™ª

â™ª For me

â™ª For me

â™ª For me

For me!

For me!

â™ª For me...

â™ª Yes â™ª

Just-- just
trying out a new--

a few ideas you might
want to use.

You really would have been
something, Mother.

Think so?

If you had had someone
to push you, like I had.

If I could've been,
I would've been,

and that's show business.

I guess I did
do it for me.

Why, Mama?

Just wanted to be noticed.

Like I wanted you
to notice me.

I still do, Mama.

It's okay, Mama.

It's okay, Rose.

Say...

You look like
you should speak French.

You're coming
to that party with me.

No.Come on.

No.
Like this?

You can wear my fur.

I've got a stole
in the box office.

Well, maybe just
for an hour or two.

Say, this looks better
on me than it does on you.

Funny how we can both
wear the same size.

Especially in mink.

You know,
I had a dream last night.

It was a big poster
of a mother and daughter--

like the cover of that
ladies' magazine.

Yes, Mother.Only it was you and me

wearing exactly
the same gown.

It was an ad for Minsky.

And the headline said,

"Madam Rose...

...and her daughter Gypsy"!

â™ªâ™ª
