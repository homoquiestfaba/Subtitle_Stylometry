I can't believe we're actually
staying with Cameron Hunter.

This is a dream come true

I've seen every one of your movies
at least five times

I'm sorry ...

I mean, you can have any girl you want.

True.

I want you.

And you.

and them

and them

Hold on.

Cameron!

Cameron!

Cameron!

Ah! Morning Cheeky

Morning Boss! Bright eyed and
bushy tailed this morning aren't we?

I want a drink.

You know there's some ... uh ...
guests up in the master bedroom.

Do you think they could be
gone by, uh, noon?

Of course.

Are there any messages?

On the machine? Um, your publicist
left one to catch your photograph.

You have a tasting at 1 for tonight,
a sit down with props at 2,

haircut 3:45, you get to meet
the wife of your banker at 6, and

don' t forget the training at 8.
OK?

Is there any way I could get out of it?

Oh, and, Lou called wondering where you are.

Shit, I forgot, could you
call him and tell him ...

you'll be late... I did.

you did good.

I'll bring the car around,
you check the messages, OK?

You have fourteen messages.

How you doing, kid?

You look great.

All right.

What's up Lou?
Great news.

Mystique has "Space Buddies 2"
in mind with you.

no more sequels.

Right!

We'll just tell them "No Thanks".

I'm serious.

I want to do something else.

I want to do this.

man, there's a chill.

It's an art film.

done by some kids, just out of film school.

It's deep.

It's dark.

It's edgy.

there's not even dialogue
for the first half hour.

Gee, sounds great.

Doesn't it!

You're kidding me, right?

This is going to be a move,
where I can get the respect I deserve.

Respect!

I'll tell you what people respect.

An actor who gets 3 million a picture.

That's what people respect.

You know how many people
out there would kill to be you?

Right now, in this city,

there's probably some young
schmuck out there thinking,

I wish I were Cameron Hunter.

You know, I can't get arrested
in this town as an actor,

and that guy made
20 million dollars a picture.

It's not fair.

You know what, I'm sure
something will come up eventually

Yeah, I gotta get a job.

Oh hey, my buddy just called.

You can work at a place in Beverly Hills.

Delivering pizzas you can
get $300 a day in tips

the number's on there
if you're interested.

I can't, I want to be available
for auditions.

I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but you're not getting any auditions.

That's because of Cameron Hunter.

I can't get arrested in this town
because I look too like him.

Why don't you go back to your music?

You used to love that stuff.
Look at these trophies and stuff

they loved you.

you looked happier there.

Yeah, what happened to your ambition?

You know, I thought you were going to be
a great big famous screenwriter.

I am

I just can't write now,
it's all in a mess.

You know what?

Screw this

I'm going surfing,

I'm tired of talking about this crap.

You coming?

It will do you some good.

No, I'm good.

Yeah, no, it's gonna be good

Yeah, I know, it's here early.

see you when you get here.

the blonde...
all right.

who's the other one?
No, no, not the little one

we still got ...

Hey, when you get over here ...

Uh, I got to go. Bye.

Hi. Hi Karen.
what are you doing here?

Well, I was on my way to do
something at a Shakespeare festival,

and I thought I would surprise you.

You did.

Come in.

Hi.
Hi.

So, what's going on here?
You, um, having a party or something?

Kind of. It's like a Friday
night thing, you know?

A bunch of people
come over, party,

It's whether I want it or not
they're going to come over, so...

Hmm, you have quite a
social life, don't you?

Every time I see you out, you're usually
with this girl, or that girl...

You know that's all for the press.

You are the only one I love.

You know that.

Then why don't you live in the
market with me?

You know I can't do that.

Why don't you just stay here?

oh, Hollywood isn't me.

Besides, where I live
I could be chairman in 4 more years.

You want to know what's on the ????

No, later.
I want to know what time your flight s.

It's in a few hours. Why?

I was just thinking

that doesn't give us a lot of time.

Time for what?

Karen

Don't stay away too long.

I need you.

I mean, this is a great time.

It's so much better with you here.

Cameron, things come so easy for you.

I think you need to challenge yourself.

Find something that

that you can use your heart at.

Otherwise, all this
success is going to ruin you.

I'm going to make you proud of me.

Hello!

Hello Cameron. Are you sitting down?

What?

Listen to this.

I got Kaufman to come to 22 five
in Space Buddies 2.

All you gotta do is the usual and
show up for the role.

Great, yeah but,
you know what I think?

I think I am going to slip
away somewhere

Somewhere like a cabin away where
I can't be bothered by this sort of call.

Really getting tired of this.

I'm going to lose... 50 pounds.

Listen slick.

When life hands you a glass of lemonade,
don't make lemons.

We worked hard on this.

Don't blow it.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Yeah, yeah.

I got pizza!

Happy boy!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, pizza

Can I help you?

Yeah, uh, who's gonna pay for the pizza?

Here why don't you meet me
at the bottom of the stairs.

On the... OK.

Oh, I don't believe this.

That's pretty fucking amazing.

Yeah.

What is this some pay you
to look like that?

No, no, I'm just delivering pizza.

You like that job?

No. No.

Look you know, I'm sorry if
I caused any trouble

Pizza comes to $22.50.

Why don't you have a slice on me. I might
have a little better proposition for you.

Let's say that you disappeared from
the face of the earth for.. 30 days.

Do you think anyone might notice?

Probably not.

You know, you could help me.
How?

You could pretend to be me.

You could be Cameron Hunter.

I mean, that way I could get out of here,
go where I want to go.

You really think that anyone
would be fooled by that?

Oh Yeah!
People believe what they see.

All you have to do is just stay here.

Hang out for a while.

You go do some clothes,

Hang out with some girls

Do what's your thing

You can drive my Porsche.

You have a Porsche?

I'll give you my credit card

Hell, I could pay you,
like, 50 grand.

Do you know what,
do you really need these?

No, I only wear them so
I don't look like you.

That is really amazing.

Yeah, you know what, this isn't gonna work

I don't think I can do it.

Oh sure you will.

50 grand?

But, you can't tell anybody.

Alright? You can't tell my manager,
not my assistant Jenkins

Don't have any contact with
Sue or Jenkins,

sign contracts or autographs,
anything like that.

So what do you say?

excuse me

Oh, hey boss.

You're Jenkins?

What?

Nothing.

Rough night?

Yeah, kind of.

Jesus, what is this?

Oh, uh, we ran out of garlic so,
I used pepper.

Yeah, that gives it a kick.

I got your message and put
Tom Hicks on for today,

Do you want me to stick around here
and field calls for you?

No, I don't.

Is everything OK?

yeah.

Listen, why don't you just
take the day off?

OK, now I know there's something wrong.
I'm calling your internist.

No, no, no everything is alright
it's just

I'm just taking a bit of time off.

That's all. Look, I'll call
you if I need you.

You're sure?
Yeah.

OK.

Ok, I'm going to leave my cell phone
on if you change your mind.

Lou called twice, and a
reporter called also.

Have a fun day.

Alright. Enjoy yourself.

I would like to thank all the
little people who made me the

people's favourite this year,
Cameron Hunter.

Sam, dude, you gotta get up here.
you're not going to believe where I am.

Come here, come here, look.

full entertainment system, 5 player CDs,
that's awesome right there.

Look at this. Beer

look, look, look, look.
my own refrigerator.

it's got two doors.

It's like all of a sudden I'm famous.

I always wanted to be the best friend
of a star.

Holy!

get naked!

This is gonna be so much fun!
Yeah, look at that.

We gotta meet them.
We have to. Yeah.

OK. Remember, I'm Cameron.

Oh, hi. Sorry for using your pool,
it's a hot day.

Please don't call the police.
We so wanted to meet you.

No that's uh, fine, you know.
It's always a pleasure to meet my public.

Would you like to come in?

That's funny, because we were just
thinking about going swimming.

who are you?

Whoa, excuse me. I'm Tim's friend.

And who is Tim?

Cameron, Cameron, yeah Cameron's friend.

What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.

No, it's all cool.

Cameron's down by the pool,
we're just having some brews.

Sorry about the flash.
You must be Jenkins.

Tell Cameron that I will be doing things
in his office, alright?

Do you want a beer?
No thanks.

Love that skirt!

oh good.
Oh, I could live like this.

very nice.
Hi!

that's happening!

ooh, that's bad.
What are these, imported? Agh.

yeah, it said they're from Cuba.
Agh.

Sticking to beer.
Yeah, right on.

Hey! 2 drinks.

15 bucks each.

I told him to put it on the tab.
Oh yeah!

Have you seen anyone in here?
yeah I took a loop around.

Really? Yeah you wouldn't believe it.

I just ... I didn't mean ...
Isn't that your assistant?

That girl over there ...
That one right there?

Dude, every girl wants to fuck
Cameron Hunter.

Hello.

You're not supposed to answer the phone.

Cameron?

Hey look, I don't have long to talk
before this cell phone dies.

I just wanted to let you know
that I'm in a cabin.

You know what, I've even got
a mosquito bite.

Do you know how long its been since
I've had a mosquito bite?

No.
Hey, uh, that Jenkins...

Uh, do I do her too?

No, no, not her, ok,
this is business.

You even try to do her you'll get
arrested, alright?

Ok. Hey, your agent's been calling.

Alright, well don't talk to him. If he talks
to you, you make no decisions, ok?

Ok, will do.

Ok, talk to you later.
Ok.

Hi, may I help you?

Cameron, it's me. from Stanford.
We have an interview today.

We do? Yeah. My editor helped
me come up with 200 questions.

We'll finally get to the bottom
of Cameron Hunter.

Oh, no, no we're not, you see, I mean,

I've been sick, I've been throwing up all day, and

maybe, you could come back
in a couple weeks.

A couple of weeks?

Yeah, you know,
Sam can show you out.

Can you do that?
Um... door.

Bye.

So, you're a friend of Cameron's.

Well, would you mind helping
me to get into Cameron?

If he decides to do what
ever things I'm into.

It would really help me out.

I don't know.

It's my job to get close to a star.

And if that happens to mean
close to their friend

then I don't mind.
I'm more than willing. - Really?

Are you sure you're not interested
in helping me out?

I'll make it worth your while.

Well, ... maybe.

So, what do you know about ...

So you're gonna help me?

yeah, I guess.

So, what good gossip are you going to
come up with now we're partners?

Well, I told you everything I know.

really I don't know him too well.

But you said you would help me out.

No, I never said that.
Beer?

You bastard!
Wait a second, I had fun didn't you?

Thanks for coming.

Get it? thanks for coming.

I love being a movie star.

Get the phone.

I thought you weren't supposed
to answer the phone.

What's the fun of being Cameron Hunter if
you can't actually be Cameron Hunter?

See, let it ring for a couple.

Cameron Hunter.

What!

Yeah!
Hold it.

Ok, give me the number.

Ok, got it.
OK, I'll call you back.

Hey, hey!

That was Steven Kaufman for us.

The Steven Kaufman?

Yeah, he wants me to go in and audition
for his film "Space Buddies 2".

No, he wants Cameron Hunter to
go and audition.

What's the difference?

Might be fun to screw around with
Steven Kaufman. What do you think?

I think you need to get out of the pool.
I need another beer, you want one?

Uh, yeah, Steven Kaufman please.

Space Buddies did what, ah,
200 million?

We're gonna double that, you and me.
You believe that?

If you say so.
I do say so.

Listen, the effects that we got lined up
for Space Buddies 2 are a must-see.

That and the signings.
I swear, a true story.

Alright, listen.

Come on. This isn't an audition.
You're Cameron Hunter.

You can do this part in your sleep.
Ok?

I just want to hear you're in with
Jennifer Parkin, that's all.

Jennifer Parkin?

Yeah. You didn't hear?

Aw, man, you are gonna love this
sweet sweet role.

Yeah, send her in.

Mmm. It's all good Cameron.

Hello everyone.

Jennifer, how are you?

Hi.
Thanks for coming down.

Lou Spiro. marketing.

Love your work. Love it.

You should have gotten a statue
for your work on Night Tales, definitely.

That's a real sweet thing to say. Thankyou.

yeah well, let's just jump in, you know?
See where we're at.

Please have a seat.

Cameron.

You're Mark McCoy. Space pirate.

Jennifer. You are a Federation spy with
a heart of gold.

Now.

Make me feel the long living human love.

Make me feel the vastness of space.

and. action.

what are you doing up here?

Starbase regulations,
all passengers in the back.

I'm not a passenger, remember?

I'm a stowaway.

I remember. and just as soon as we get back
to the bend, your ass is going back.

there's a hefty reward for fugitives.

Is that all that I am to you?
Just reward money?

You and I had something more.

Listen, lady. Or whatever you are.

As far as I'm concerned, you're cargo.

I've got a spaceship to fly.

Not for long if you don't watch
for that asteroid!

It's Ok, sister.
I can do this.

I've been flying in space since
I was 14 years old.

You know, I'm sorry, I'm having a
time with this dialogue, it's tough.

I mean, maybe he just doesn't want it,
out of a growing awareness of the shades.

Kind of adds a whole new level of interest.

Yeah. yeah, um...

No.

No. you know, what we have
here is an action picture.

Ok?

Alright?

Lou, back me up here. I mean, let me
just show you, in the climax here

your character, Mark McCoy,

blasts into hyperdrive.
and what does he do?

he shoots right into the middle
of this planet

I mean, right into it. What happens?
What happens?

There is an explosion!

the biggest, most amazing explosion
ever to be seen on the big screen.

Ok?

This planet, you gotta see what we do
with this planet, is unbelievable.

it's so incredible.

the audience is gonna be sitting there going
Oh my God, look how beautiful, and

boom, it's all gone, I want to look
and I can't look.

You got to see it, you will you get it,
you see, you have the means.

So that's about it.

I was just living where, deep in
the character you know.

yeah, absolutely, I am all up for
suggestions.

hah, we should get that out of the way.

Ok, indulge me,

give me that Cameron Hunter laugh

Just once, come on.

No, no.
Come on.

I couldn't.

Please

Uh, I have a sore throat.
It hurts.

Oh gosh, thank God.

Lou, you're scaring me.

Alright, there's plenty of time to save
that, right? Right.

Well, I have to go everybody. I have a
function I am late for.

Jenny, thank you so much for coming in.
We'll be in touch.

I'll walk you out.

So, that went well.
Please have a seat.

I am prepared to offer you the role,
right now.

You're kidding.

No, no, you're prepared to offer Cameron
Hunter the role, right now, right?

yeah, what do you need, an interpreter?

Yes, that's right. yes.

Look, I got a deal ready right here.
I want you to sign that.

You can play today, or the studio's
gonna make me go with the second choice.

Hold on, Cameron, we've got some
problems, don't you remember?

Wow, what's this?

yeah, uh, well we got some ideas we thought
would strengthen the story.

You do have you?

and uh, Cameron doesn't sign until
you take a look at this story.

Well, I don't know about that.

yeah, yeah. I'll sign, only if you agree to
hire Sam to do a rewrite.

What is, what is this you come in here
and lay this on me?

No, you don't come to my office and
tell me how to run my picture, ok?

hey, did you believe me?

that was good.

Kinda got you on that.

You're good. You got balls kid.
So I'm gonna agree to see your first draft.

and that's it.

and also, you agree to sign on, today.

Now I'm not trying to cut you off in this,
we're doing business.

Two weeks from now, what are
you going to be saying?

I fucked up.

Don't let that happen.

Ok, but can we wait, can we wait a few
more minutes and tell Lou about it?

Absolutely.

Just sign.

What were you thinking dude?

What, what’s wrong, I got you some work.

Yeah you also signed Cameron Hunter
up for a movie.

yeah but its Space Buddies part 2.

I'm sure he'll like it.

and look what Jennifer gave me.

It says call me.
Nice.

Its Jennifer Parkin.

hook me up man, you think she has a friend?

I don't know.

Well, movie star, I'm outta here.
I gotta start writing.

Yeah, and I got to see Jennifer tonight,
and I don’t know what to do.

Oh, take her some place you'll feel good.
Don't forget that you are Cameron Hunter.

I mean, look at that.

And don't forget the laugh.

I'll see you tomorrow.

What a darling little place.

Whose place is this?

Oh, uh, this is where I lived when I first
moved to Los Angeles.

I keep it as a way of remembering
the years of struggle.

It's a wonderful idea.

Do you have a bottle of water?

no. no.

You know, you're more beautiful in person
than you are on television.

that's so sweet.

would you like to take my clothes off?

and go slow 'cause, I'm a little bit shy.

really?

sit down.

That's it. I've now fallen into bed with
a fabulous guy worth over 23 million.

That's what this was all about?

Oh don't tell me you're offended.

You seemed to be enjoying yourself.

Ok, let's go over the ground zero.

There's always a bunch of photographers
right out front

and when they see us together

it will make all the magazine covers
for a month.

I thought maybe we could stay in.

go over the script, run some lines
and stuff?

Please, I don't do that shit unless
I'm getting paid for it.

So, let's go on, come on.

No, no, I think I'm gonna stay here tonight.

now wait a minute honey.

You say no to Jennifer Parkin,
she doesn't ask again.

Are you gonna go?

No?

Suit yourself.

Oh, no, thanks.

I was wondering how long it would take
for you

to stop pretending that you like this stuff.

What do you mean pretending?

Is there something you want to tell me?

What do you mean?

About the fact that

Cameron Hunter hates orange juice.

and he happens to be left handed.

Hey, hey,
what did you do with Cameron?

my name is Tim Bennet.

Cameron hired me to replace him
for a few weeks.

Do you believe me?

Well, I, I wouldn't normally, but...

it sounds like something Cameron would do.

My God, the resemblance is remarkable.

yeah.

Listen, he didn't want anybody to know.

and I promised him I would
leave his life as I found it.

So, nobody knows.

No, I mean, I even fooled Steven Kaufman.

wait, when did you talk to Steven Kaufman?

He called me for an audition.

Ok don't go. Cameron doesn't want anything
to do with that Space Buddies sequel.

He doesn't?

No, nothing.

The best thing you can do is just stay away
from Kaufman, from Lou, from anyone.

I'll cover for you.

I don't want you making any messes
that he can't clean up.

Wait, here's my card.

You call me if you need anything.

and do not use that phone.

Right. Ok.

Cameron, you there, the studio tells
me you added a condition to Space Buddies.

Hello.- Cameron.
Yeah.

Hello, uh, I've changed my mind
about Space Buddies.

Don't start that nonsense again.

You want to get sued for breach?

You want to be the most hated in town?

But Lou.

I told them we'd meet about it.

Ah, yeah, sure.

That's my boy.

Jesus.

Look, it's Cameron Hunter!

Hello.

Cameron?

Excuse me,

What the hell are you doing in here?

Hi honey, want to wash my back?

No!

You what, this is getting out of hand.

You can't break in to someone's
house like this.

You know you're lucky I don't bop you.
You want to bop me?

No, I'm serious. You gotta get out of there.

You mean get out like this?

No, uh, hello, uh, no.

Come in!

What are you..

Love, Cameron.

Shit!

Hello.

Sam, it's me, listen. Cameron's girlfriend
just came on to me.

What do you mean, came on?
You didn't do anything?

No. No, of course not.

No but I looked right at her.

Well, just stay away from her, alright?

Right, stay away from her. Bye.

Hey uh, I'm gonna go out for a few days,
so I'll see you later.

a few days?

You know what, I've got a lot of stuff to
do, so I'll call you in a couple of weeks.

How about we eat?

The Shakespeare festival was so great.

I met these people doing a regional
theatre company in town

and they want me to consult on
their production

and they're gonna pay me.

so guess what?

I'm gonna be here for the whole week.

Great.

Have you given any thought to what we talked
about before?

what were we talking about?

Cameron come on.

You know Karen, I got to say something.

I've got a million things to do. Maybe you
could stay at a hotel for a few days?

What is wrong with you?

Nothing.

I promise, you'll just have to
trust me on this.

I don't want to stay at a hotel.

I've been in a hotel all week.

I hate hotels.

Ok, well, I gotta run and see Jenkins.

What is wrong with you?

Nothing.

Everything is going to be fine
in a few days.

OK.

Let's make love first.

Oh, no, no.

I mean, uh,

I'm trying to stay pure right now.

yeah, I'm preparing for this
really intense role,

what role?

the uh, space buddies 2.

whatever.

why don't you give me Jenkins address.

and I'll call you when you're making
some sense.

20 million dollars for this?

what's the difference

life has no meaning.

Life - has no point.

Life has no point.

this script has no point

it's awful, so bad.

Hey!

God, don't you ever wear clothes?

Maybe if you called first I wouldn't
be stuck.

Now I have to put something nice on.

Wait, can you give this to Cameron?

Do you think you could
take a look at this?

Oh God, don't tell me you're a
screenwriter too?

If you could just have a look,
I won't tell, for Cameron.

If I have time,
Ok?

Love that blouse.

Hi there.

How did you get through the gate?

I know your secret.

I know everything.

How long did you think the two of you could
keep something like this from me?

Not long, I guess.

You can invite me in?

and uh,

we could talk about it.

I hope you understand that you
can't write this story.

It's too big to sit on it.

"Cameron Hunter agrees to Space Buddies 2."

But you can't

write

Oh, the big sequel.

Yeah, but you see, it hasn't

officially been signed yet.

A little bird told me you signed a deal
with Kaufman.

Lisa, you can't print this story yet.

and what do I get for not printing it?

I uh, what do you want?

You know what I want.

Oh, fuck, holy, holy

Karen, Karen!

Get out of the way!

Friend of yours?

You have to leave.

Now, this interview is over.

So uh, I can run the story then.

No. Please just leave me alone.

What are you doing here?

Karen, I know this is gonna sound dumb,
but will you please let me explain.

I have a better idea. Why don't I close
the door and you go away.

I can't. I don't have anywhere to go to.

Come in.

You mean everything to me.

You're a better actor than I thought.

I'm serious.

Listen, that reporter wanted to write
a story about me

and I didn't want her to write it.

I tried to be nice to her

but she took it the wrong way.

and?

I've been reading your letters

I mean, re-reading them.

and it's amazing.

I mean, the way that you
are about acting.

and talk about life.

It's like I always had those feelings

but didn't have the words for them.

I've never met a woman like you before.

Do you mean that?

Of course I do.

Do you think

maybe we could

go back to the way that we were?

well, it...

well, we could get something
to eat and talk about it.

Coming!

Well, hello there.

Jesus you're dangling.

Come on, I was just taking a nap

and just rubbing my shoulder,
Come on in.

Um, I had a look at, to see your script

Aw, thanks.

So, what did you think?

You wrote that in a week?
Yeah.

You came up with all those characters,
and the house and a plot,

and all of this
in a week?

yeah, does it show?

It's amazing.

It's the smartest thing I've read in months.

great!

You know, I tried to write there was
something there but I wasn't sure, so

I really appreciate this

Oh, you're welcome.

So

You know what, I know you think
I'm a hard ass.

Come on.

No, it's ok,
I don't mind it.

I take my work seriously.

and that scares guys off sometimes.

But when I'm not at work

I can be just as playful as any girl.

Um, I'm sure you can.

and,

I know that I'm not usual for you

so um,

I hope you don't mind me asking

are you doing anything tonight?

You know, like I say, I was just
working this knot out of my shoulder.

Right.

Well, um,

do you need any help?

I hope you like this place
I know its a surprise.

No, it's fine.

What are you looking at
me like that for?

You are so beautiful.

I don't know if I can ever get enough.

So, tell me about the theatre.

Nah, you don't want to hear about it.

No, I do, I do, really.

yeah?

ok.

Well, this fall we're gonna have, um

Ibsen.

and I'm gonna direct.

and

open this whole Mamet series

It's gonna be great.

You should come and see it

I really miss working in theatre,
it's the best

I mean, working with people in their craft

and watching people make a connection
with an audience

What do you know about real theatre?

Oh, I've done a lot.

I mean it was

it was before I met you though.

You never told me that.

You know, you never talk about yourself.

why are you being so honest now?

I think it's you.

something about you makes me

want to be better.

Cameron

that is the sweetest thing you've
ever said to me.

Ah, hold on to that.

Now,

If the old Cameron comes back

you still have to like him.

Why would the old Cameron come back?

I'm just saying hypothetical if he did,
but it didn't sound right

and you want to be around Cameron

Make love to me.

You know that wouldn't be a bad idea, but

Have you ever got naked and made love to me?

You have never made love to me
like that before.

Was it ok?

Of course, it was wonderful.

Where did you learn that,
thing with your hips you do?

Oh, I just made that up

Well, that may be a first for us after all.

It is really.
Yeah?

Do you, do you love me?

I mean, more than the old Cameron?

yes, I do.

Would you love me if I wasn't
rich and famous?

Of course I would.

It's on the inside that's what counts.

you know that.

I'm gonna take a shower

then I'm going to make us some breakfast.

so nice.

Jesus.

Tim

what?

you can't do this.

do what?

falling in love with Karen.

Maybe all this was supposed to happen.

I mean, she's unlike any girl I've ever
met before.

but

you made a promise to Cameron

that you would

leave his life the way you found it.

How would Karen feel if she found out

that you were some other guy
who's been misleading her?

She's not yours, Tim.

I guess you're right.

Listen will you do me a favour?

Would you tell Karen

I had to go out of town, on
an emergency. or something

Cameron will be back in a few days,

and everything will be Ok.

and I guess I'll just

live my life.

Sorry Tim.

Yeah this is Lou.

Lou, I feel like I’m 90 here.

Cameron.

Hey I got the feeling this is absolutely

the best contract with Kaufman

what?

I think it's crazy on the news already

Cameron.

Lou. hold on. I'll be right back

I am not believing this thing about you.

me too.

I thought you were going to be leaving town?

I was, but I'm back.

you know I've got Lou on the phone.

but I'll deal with that later

right now I want to take you upstairs.

do that thing you do.

what?

that thing that you do with your hips

You know what I mean.

Come on, don't tease me.

Oh, you know what, I just forgot,
be right back, I'll do it.

Lou

yeah, Lou Sperling

Lou, hey, Les is still on the old time,
right?

Jesus, Cameron, listen, I got Kaufman
on the other line.

You can't say no.

Perfect, great. Come over in the morning
with the contract, we'll sign, alright?

Cameron

are you coming back to bed?

OK, does someone want to tell me
what is going on?

Alright, I can explain.

Maybe I should. It might be easiest.

Well, I just want to know how

I just want to know how long
this has been going on?

and which one of you have I been
sleeping with?

Who is responsible for this prank?

Well?

Are you not going to speak?

You slept with my girl?

I didn't mean to.

It was her idea.

I didn't want to blow your cover.

Well, you better go and explain it.

I think I've done enough already.

I don't want to go.

Hi Karen.

It's uh,

I guess we haven't been properly introduced.

My name is Tim

I'm sorry about this.

Please don't blame Cameron.

It wasn't his fault.

I had no business doing what we did.

No, you didn't.

Well, the thing is, just

well, I, fell in love with you.

You know it's a pretty easy thing to do.

and you're beautiful.

smart.

kind.

You're wonderful, you know.

Everything I said last night was true.

That was you?

You know I started imagining what my life
would be like with a girl like you in it.

and I liked it.

But then I realized I didn't deserve you.

not after lying to you the way I did.

So I just came up to tell you I'm sorry.

and goodbye.

Baby!

It's me.

It's the real me.

Aw, baby you're not going
to be mad at me, are you?

Come on.

I didn't mean for you to find out.

You know what? I really liked it
while I was gone.

I know it's a lot for you to advance your
career and everything but

honey, we could find a way for
you to fit in.

what do you say?

I say you both get out of here.

why should I leave for a loser?

You know, I fell in love with a man.

and I'm not going to throw that all away

just because of some stupid prank.

That's right

Right

This is the man I fell in love with.

Wait a minute, that's not me, I'm me.

And I'm me Cameron.

You have to accept that we're
never gonna change.

what do you mean?

I don't belong here.

I'm sorry.

Come with me.

I'm going to have to work in Portland

are you coming with me?

You want me to come?

Well, you're obviously a good actor.

the regional theatre could use an
actor like you.

I could, too.

I just, just, this matter with Cameron.

Well, Cameron and I have obviously
outgrown each other.

I'll miss this.

I'll be Ok.

Yeah, what about Cameron?

He'll be Ok too.

He's Cameron Hunter.
