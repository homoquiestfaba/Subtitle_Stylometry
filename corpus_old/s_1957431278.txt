["Little Saint Nick"
by The Beach Boys playing]

<i>â™ª Ooh
Merry Christmas Saint Nick â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Christmas comes this time each year â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well way up North
Where the air gets cold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's a tale about Christmas
That you've all been told â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And a realâ€¦ â™ª</i>

<i>according to Greek mythology,</i>

<i>humans were originally created
with four arms, four legs,</i>

<i>and a head with two faces.</i>

<i>But fearing their power,
Zeus split them into two separate parts,</i>

<i>condemning humans
to spend the rest of their lives</i>

<i>searching for their other half,
their soul's equal.</i>

<i>â™ª She's candy apple red
With a ski for a wheel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And when Santa hits the gas
Man, just watch her peel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's the little Saint Nickâ€¦ â™ª</i>


<i>then Zeus is an asshole.</i>

<i>â™ª Little Saint Nick â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Run run reindeer â™ª</i>

<i>never really been easy,</i>

<i>but modern dating online is even harder.</i>

<i>I keep thinking my perfect match
has to be out there, just one click away.</i>

<i>- Someone kind, and honest, and ideallyâ€¦</i>
[man] Honey?

<i>have a wife. Am I right?</i>

<i>â™ª â€¦with Rudy to lead â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He's got to wear his gogglesâ€¦ â™ª</i>

<i>that maybe I should give up altogether,</i>

<i>along comes Ted, a Libra who likes puppies</i>

<i>and offers to take me on a sunset sail</i>

<i>until he ghosts me.</i>

<i>But on a positive note,</i>

<i>I've turned my horrible love life
into a successful online writing career.</i>

<i>For years,
I've been chronicling my disaster dates</i>

<i>under the pseudonym "Always a Bridesmaid."</i>

<i>And people seem to love
that I can't find love.</i>

<i>But honestly, I'm not sure
how much longer I can do this.</i>

<i>How is it that everyone
has found the one, and I haven't?</i>

<i>Either I'm the unluckiest woman
in the world,</i>

<i>or my picker is broken.</i>

It's both.

What's the one common denominator
in all of these dates?

It's you.

I beg your pardon?

The common denominator
is that it's a bunch of LA assholes.

That's your other problem.
You're only looking local.

I had to import Mark from Ohio,
for God's sakes.

You gotta think bigger.

Jesus, Nat! You only have
your dating radius set to five miles.

You gotta look outside West Hollywood.

Gas is so expensive.

I mean, it'd be 40 bucks to get
to Glendale, and that's only one way.

It's cheaper to do cocaine
and then run everywhere.

[chuckles]
Okay. Fixed it.

I'm gonna get a juice. Want something?

Ooh yeah, uh, grab me a Green Latifah
with an extra shot of wheatgrass.

Oh, but no kiwi because I'm...
Iâ€¦ I know, you're allergic. No kiwi.

Sorry. Habit.

The last time an intern forgot,
I almost died.

Natalie, where's my next story?
I'm assuming your next date is lined up.

I was thinking for the next one,
maybe we'll try something different. Likeâ€¦

Something a little bit more upbeat?

Why the hell would you do that?

So I don't spend another evening

with a guy who was featured
on an episode of <i>Hoarders.</i>

It's making me miserable.
Oh, I'm sorry. [sucks in air]

Everyone's miserable, though.

But that's why Soash Media exists

to either distract people
from their own lives,

or to show them that things could be,
you know, so, so much worse.

Remember, a disaster for you
is a hit for me. Okay?

Got food in your teeth.
You might wannaâ€¦ [clicks tongue]

Get it to me!

<i>Worst Christmas movie ever!</i>


<i>So how do you really feel about
my favorite Christmas movie?</i>

<i>falling in love based on how they look.</i>

<i>about the triumph of love over reality.</i>

I can work with that.

["Everyday" by Ada Pasternak playing]

<i>favorite Christmas movie?</i>

<i>Hands down, </i>Die Hard.

Die Hard <i>is a Christmas movie?</i>



<i>Okay.</i>

<i>seven reasons, to be exact.</i>


<i>during a Christmas party.</i>

[Josh] <i>Doesn't make it a Christmas movie!</i>
[Natalie] <i>I have more evidence.</i>

<i>Two, it snows at the end.
Number three, there are presents involved.</i>

<i>in most movies ever made!</i>

<i>You know what? I'm willing
to reconsider this. I might actually...</i>

["Everyday" by Ada Pasternak continues]

Holy shit!
I mean, this guy is, like,Â friggin' hot.

He knows the difference betweenÂ <i>there</i>
and <i>they are,</i> which you'd be surprised by.

{\an8}He's Asian-American
and speaks three languages.

He's a world traveler but hasn't been
to any places on the watch list.

So really there's only one con.
What?

You've never seen him.

Come on. [chuckles]
There's six pictures on his profile.

That means nothing. Remember the last guy
you met up with in public?

Yeah.
Yeah.

He ended up being
20 years older than his photos.

This guy could be old.
He could be a waiter from the Last Supper.

What?
Look at me.Â Look at me.

You do not trust anybody
unless he sends you a photo

holding today's newspaper
with the date on it. Okay? Yeah.

Oh yeah, that's what we're gonna do.
I'm calling him to get a photo.

No! No.
Yeah. What?

I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry.
[phone ringing]

I'm a large woman.
No.

You cannot get this phone.
No.

Yeah, try me. Oh! Okay, fine!
No. Oh!

[woman laughing]
[Josh] <i>Hello?</i>

Josh!
[Josh] <i>Hey, Natalie.</i>

[mouthing] I'm sorry.
Hi!

Hey.
[woman] Mm-hmm.

Iâ€¦ I actually didn't mean to call you.
I was, um, hiking andâ€¦

I tripped and accidentally hit "Call."
What the fuck are you saying?

[Josh] <i>Glad you're still alive.</i>
What?

<i>your emergency contact,</i>

<i>even with the three-hour time difference.</i>

[whispering] I'm sorry.
Nope. Nope. I'm still alive.

So anyway, Iâ€¦ I better get back to it.

Sorry to bother you. Bye.
[disconnects]

I'm gonna kill you.

[laughing] I'm sorry!
[text tone]

What?

What?
Are you satisfied?


Yeah, she's satisfied. Oh my God.

[squeals]
He is so cute!

[sighs] Oh.
What isâ€¦ likeâ€¦ what is this?

I meanâ€¦

<i>in the tub, that's when we'll worry.</i>


You know, when I first saw your profile,
I thought you'd just be another guy

who's really hot
and has a dick pic on standby.

<i>- Well, what makes you think I'm not?</i>
[text tone]


[text tone]

Ah.
<i>- Your turn! Tit for tat, Nat.</i>

<i>You would've loved her.</i>


<i>â™ª You don't roll no more â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I dreamt last night â™ª</i>

Honestly, I'm so over eating out.
I prefer to just stay in and cook.

[Josh] <i>Oh! YouÂ cook?</i>
Oh yeah. All the time.

Tonight I'll be assisted in the kitchen

by Chef Boyardee
and my good friends Ben and Jerry.

<i>â™ª Roll on babe â™ª</i>

[text tone]

<i>â™ª Oh girl
I don't know all the reasons why â™ª</i>

[sighs deeply]

Natalie. My office, now.

Where's my next Disaster Date story?

Umâ€¦ Could you just pause for a second?
It's a little distracting.

Now, where's my next story?

Here's the thing.

I met someone. [exhales]
Mm-hmm.

I think this might be the real deal.

[man] Oh boy. Here we go.
I'd like to write about that instead.

I'm not buying it.

Just go out with some Tinder tool
and complain about him, please.

I don't complain.

Why'd you dump the guy
with the guinea pigs?

They freaked me out.

And the guy who smiled all the time?

You could never tell
if he was actually happy.

How about the guy who kept calling
your relationship a collab?

Do I really need to explain?


[breathing heavily] Natalie,
here's the deal, okay?

Your dating life is a disaster.

But you should be thankful
because it's why you have a job.

[weights rattling]

What if I write a piece

about a girl on the verge
of completely giving upÂ on love

when sheÂ comes to find
that the perfect guy might actually exist?

So she risks it all.

Her sanity, her common sense,

her ability to ever be on <i>The Bachelor,</i>

and it's worth it
because they fall in love

just in time for Christmas.

[man] Ooh, I like it.
[chuckles]

I just don't think
you're the one to write it.

You gotta leave the serious stuff
to the real journalists, like Steve.

Screw Steve.

I did.Â Hastag don't tell HR. Low-key.

You know what?

As of this moment right now,
my disaster dating days are over.

I'm gonna fly to Lake Placid, New York.

I'm gonna surprise Josh,
and I'm gonna get my happy ending.

I'm sorry.
So, you haven't even met this dude yet?

Well, notâ€¦ not in person, but...
Oh, I take it all back.

No, I take everything back.
You should write about this.

You should fly across the country

and surprise a virtual stranger
for the holidays.

This is gonna be
your most epic Disaster Date yet.

Uh-oh. Who's doing the dance?

You're wrong, Lee, and I'm gonna show you.

Because this is going to be
the most epic love story

that you have ever read.

Now, if you'll please excuse me,
I have bags to pack.

<i>- â™ª Keep on, keep moving on â™ª</i>
[exhales] Okay.

<i>â™ª You will not be happyâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Is this insane? It's kind of insane.

Am I insane? I'm insane. What am I doing?
No, no, no, no.

Hey. Insanity is doing the same thing
over and over again

and expecting different results.

You, my friend,
are about to fly 3,000 miles

to meet up with a guy
who is literally the polar opposite

of anybody you've ever dated before, so...

Oh my God. The mother of all ironies is

this might be
the most sane thing you've ever done.

How could you possibly know that?

Josh Lin is an old buddy of mine,

and given the stuff we used to smoke
in his basement after school,

that's not exactly an address you forget.

Okay. Can you please
just turn the radio off? [scoffs]

It's a great song and a classic.
["Baby, It's Cold Outside" playing]

Yeah. It's been putting the hip

Uh. He's not here right now,

Uh, why don't you come inside and wait?

Oh. Um. Sure.

Oh my goodness. Um.

I wasn't expecting company, uh, tonight.
I'm Barb. I'm Josh's mom.

Nice to meet you.
Hi. You too.

So, you and Josh are friends?

Yeah. Yeah.
I guess you could say that. [chuckles]

For the last time, we're not converting!


It's a friend of Josh's!

He does that every single, solitary time,
even Halloween.

Every time it rang one year,
he was like, "Is that the Mormons?"

Here is Bob.

This is Josh's Dad.
And this is his Grandmother, June.

Hello, dear!
Hi. Oh.


How do you know Josh?
Ah, they're friends, Grandma June.

We're maybe
just a little bit more than just friends.

Oh my God. Are youâ€¦ are you his "G Word"?

Geisha?
No.

Oh, you're his girlfriend?

I mean maybe. There's no titles yet.

Oh my! Thisâ€¦ this is just off the charts.
Look at you!

[Natalie] Thanks. It's a new lip gloss.
Josh has a girlfriend?

Well, I meanâ€¦ noâ€¦

Do we have something special? Yes.

Did I fly from LA
to surprise him for Christmas?

Mm-hmm. Sure did. Here I am. Am I crazy?
A little.

Uh, yeah, maybe a little.
You are... This is just so romantic.




That's him. Josh!

Someone's here to see you!

The UPS guy's not here to see me.
Just sign for the package!

It's not UPS! [laughing]

Just come up!

[breathing heavily] I don't understand.

We talked. [gulps]
I made sure... Theâ€¦ the photo!

It had my name on it.
You wrote, "Bye, Natalie!"

I'm pretty good at Photoshop.

Don't. Don't. No, no, no, no.

and then starts a fake
relationship online?


flies across the country
and shows up on somebody's front lawn?

You said, and I quote, "I wish
you were here with me for Christmas."

That's just something people say.
Like, "Your baby's so cute"

or "My diet starts tomorrow."

Everybody knows that.
[groans]


Are you implying that this is my fault?

Nobody is blaming anybody, okay?
[Natalie] Oh!

Maybe, maybe I get it, you never dated
a Chinese guy before, and you're in shock!

Yes, I have. He was born in Beijing,
and he was amazing in bed.

How could you lie to me?
I really liked you.

I'm sorry. Iâ€¦ I never meant
for it to go this far. Okay?

Can weâ€¦ can we go back inside and...
No, I'm not going inside!

I'm not going anywhere with you.

I never want to see you again. Okay?

[door closes]


So, you met the real Tag tonight, huh?
Mm-hmm.

Did you really think
sexy karaoke was going to work?

This is not LA, and Tag is not an LA guy.

Hot girls hit on him here all the time,
and they're all the same.

If you want him to notice you,
do something different.

Oh, he noticed me tonight.

Honestly, your face was so swollen,
you looked more like Chucky.

I doubt he'll recognize you.

I don't know anything about this guy.
But I do.

Not only were Tag and I
best friends until 8th grade,

I have been pretending to be him
for the last two weeks.

So what?

So, I know Tag
better than he knows himself.

I can help you get him.

Why would you do that?

Well, maybe if I'm helping
you with something,

maybe you can do
something for me in return.

I am not having sex with you.

No! That's not what I'm saying at all.

I was thinking maybe you can, um, pretend
to be my girlfriend until Christmas.

Um.

Why?

Did you see how my parents
looked at me tonight

when they thought you were my girlfriend?

Okay, you're crazy.

Being seen with you?
That would be a huge win.

I mean, you know,

look at you.

All I'm asking for is a week.

Then we'll stage a breakup,
and you'll be free from me forever.

[text tone]

[sighs deeply]

[cats meowing]

You're gonnaÂ set me up with Tag?

Yes! You guys will be in love
by New Year's.

Have a baby by next Thanksgiving.

By the way, do you have insurance?
They were asking me.

[dogs barking]

Well, welcome to my crib.

This is where the magic happens.

That's just something people say.
Not a lot of magic has happened at all.

Uhâ€¦ but got a mini-fridge
with all kinds of soda.

There's laundry, bathroom,
foosball table if you want to play.

with the place.

Well, it's still,
you know, it's pretty much temporary.

My apartment is still under renovation.
It sustained a little smoke damage, soâ€¦

[sighs]
Well, good night.

Just make yourself comfortable.
[clears throat, chuckles] Uh. No.

You, on the floor. Now.

This is the only Tempur-Pedic
in the house, and I have a bad back.

I don't care if this bed is the only thing
keeping you from complete paralysis.

We ain't sharing.

What if we put pillows in the middle?
No.

Okay. What if we do like head to toe?
Mm. It's always gonna be no. So, yeah.

We should probably address
the, uh, catfish in the room.

You do realize that at some point,
you were going to have to meet me.

Well, I didn't set out to catfish you.
It just kind of happened.

It kind of happened?

I had my profile up for a year,
and guess how many matches I got.

Three.

And one of them
was my old English teacher.

She's 70 now, and she has a pacemaker.

Having sex with her
would literally kill her.

So just as an experiment,

I thought I could use a picture
of a standard hot guy

and see what would happen.
I got 85 matches in five minutes.

So, apparently, there's plenty
of girls out there.

They just didn't want to date me.

Are you seriously
looking for sympathy right now?

There are no words for what you did.

Well, I would...
No words!

But a deal's a deal.
So let's just move on.

Okay.

to write the words on your hand.

[Josh laughing]
He keeps taking his glove off.

His hands are freezing.

Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I thought your finger
was gonna fall off, Dad, for sure!

Natalie!
Oh.

Come on in, come on.
Join us for breakfast. We just sat down.

Um, I actually should probably go shower.

Oh, I'm sure you look
absolutely beautiful.

But full disclosure, I can't see shit.

[all laughing]

Please, sit.

Wow, this all looks so delicious.

Oh, please, help yourself to anything.

Oh, bacon?

Oh, she's a vegetarian.
I'm a vegetarian.

But thank you, Mr. Lin.

So where did you lovebirds
rush off to last night?

Oh, we went to McGregor's for karaoke.
Mm-hmm.


Oh.
It was, uhâ€¦

Swell? Right, Natalie?

Well, I want to hear
all about how you two met.

Oh, it's just an online dating app.

Not much to it.
[scoffs]

Just text, text, send.

Next thing you know,
she's right next to me.

Here I am.
[Josh, Natalie chuckle]

What nonsense.

People used to fall in and out of love
based solely upon the written word.

The pen is mightier than the penis.

[chokes]
Grandma, let's... We have company.

Let's eat our eggs before they get cold.

So, Natalie, what was it about Josh
that first caught your eye?

Gee, I mean, umâ€¦

I don't even know where to start.

There was just so many
unbelievable things in his profile.

His photos. I took one look at that hair,
that unique physique.

Uh, I mean, that jawline. [scoffs]

I thought to myself,
"It's too good to be true."

Oh no, it's true.

He's gotten more chiseled
in the last couple of years.

Oh, but it wasn't just the photos
that ensnared me.

His bio. He's passionate about life,

loves all things outdoors.

Oh hey. He mentioned the store.
[Josh chuckles]

50 years ago.

I run it now,
but Josh is one of the salesmen.

We don't have to talk shop at breakfast.
Oh, but it's so fascinating.

And all the travel that it must involve.

Well, if you count
lunch runs to Applebee's,

then Josh travels every day.


Applebee's!

Applebee's.

You know, I've been thinking about joining
one of those dating sites.

My friend Darlene

down at Shimmering Pines,
she joined one called Gray Play,

and she has seen more ass
than a church pew.

Okay, June!Â Seriously.
[Josh] Mom.


I could use your expertise
in setting up <i>my</i> profile.

Oh. Umâ€¦
Yeah.

Okay.
Sure.

May I see yours?
And can you show me Josh's?

I didn't bring my phone. It's downstairs.
Maybe later, Grams.

Yeah. Natalie and I have to head out.

Uh, I'm gonna show her a grand tour
of Lake Placid and the store.

Oh. That's a great idea. Fun.
[Josh] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[Barb] Take your toast.
[Bob] Drive carefully.

Oh. Yeah.

Mmm. So good!
She loves her toast!

["Counting the Days"
by the Crystalairs playing]

<i>â™ª Counting the days
Been waiting since last year â™ª</i>

Okay. The first thing
you need to know about Tag

is he likes outdoorsy, adventurous women.

Not Instagram models who count carbs.

I don't count carbs.

I monitor them.

Sure. Whatever you say.
So, uh, what size are you?

what's wrong with what I'm wearing?

You wanna look relaxed,
like you don't care.

So go put these on
because Tag is gonna be here any minute.

What?

Yeah, he's got an order come in.
I told him to swing by at 11:00.

Oh, also, take this.
Uh. [sighs]

<i>Walden?</i> Are you kidding me?
Thoreau was an asshole.

Pretend you like it
because that's Tag's favorite book.

Also! When you're talking to him,
throw in some rock climbing lingo.

He loves that shit.

[store patrons chattering]


<i>â™ª Have a holly jolly Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's the best time of the year â™ª</i>

[door chimes]

[Josh] What's up, Tag?
[Tag] Hey, buddy, how's it going?


[Bob] Is that Tag? Captain America!
How's it going?

<i>- â™ª Have a holly jolly Christmas â™ª</i>
[Bob laughs]

Ooh! Solid as a rock!
Thank you. It's good to see you, Mr. Lin.

I hear you got some carabiners for me?
[Bob] Sure do. They're in the back.

I want you to meet someone today.
[Tag] Oh? Okay.


[Tag] Nice stuff. Get some new duds in?
[Josh] Always.

Tag, I want you to meet my cousin Natalie.

And Natalie, I want you to meet
my old friend Tag.

You two are cousins?

Yeah. Uh. Weâ€¦ Well...

From my stepmom's side, so that would
technically make us step-cousins.

Oh.

A distinction that only really matters
if you're from Alabama.

She's such a joker.

Yeah.

<i>Walden?</i>

Oh.

That's my favorite book.
I reread it every year.

Really? Wow.
[Tag] Yeah.

No way!
[chuckles] Yeah.

Isn't Thoreau the best?

Well, some people find him
a self-obsessed narcissist,

fanatical about self-control,
not to mention a total hypocrite,

but personally, I find him so inspiring.

"Rather than love, than money,

than fame,

give me truth."



If anyone gets it, it's me.

God.

Have we met before?

Because you look so familiar.
Iâ€¦ I just can't put my finger on it.

Unlikely. Natalie just flew in
from California this morning.

This morning.

I actually teach a survival course
in Yosemite every summer.

Savage! [clears throat]

I guess you could say that, yeah.
I love Yosemite.

It's, uh, I mean, there's some gnar...
Like, gnarly climbing there.

You climb?

Me? [scoffs] Do I climb?
I'll climb anything that moves.

I'm an aggro.

Aggro?
Yeah, like aggressive. Aggro. [growls]

An aggressive climber.
I climb all kinds of things like

ladders, um, houses, um, trees,

laddersâ€¦

Mostly ladders. [chuckles]

That's cool.

Um, a few of us are climbing
at Rock Ventures tomorrow.

Wanna join?

Hell yeah! Let's do it.

Great.
Mm-hmm.

10:00 a.m.?
Perfect.

Um. Well, hey, it was nice
to meet you, Natalie.

I'll see you guys at 10:00 a.m.
See you, bro.

Climb you later! [chuckles]

Savage?

Gnarly?

Aggro?

You're the one who told me
to look up the lingo!

Yeah. Real words like
"rappel" and "harness."

You sound like
you got Millennial Tourette's!

Well, you know what?
We've got bigger problems.

I once broke my toe climbing out of bed.
How am I gonna climb a wall?

I can teach you right here.
I mean, how bad could you possibly be?


[Josh] All right. Come down!
[panting] I can't hold on!

[laughing] Here. Here. Come on.
[Natalie whimpering]

[exhales deeply] Sweet baby Jesus.

The key is to not focus on the wall,
but to focus on your first move.

Here, look at this.

And then, your second. Okay?

Onto your third.

See, great things are done by a series
of small things brought together.

[Natalie] Hmm?
Whew.

That's actually very insightful.

Van Gogh.
Feel free to use it on Tag sometime.

Any questions?

What was he like in high school?

Exactly what you'd expect.

Class president, prom king,
star of the football team.

Why did you stop being friends?


And you?

Didn't.

[door chimes]

Go ahead, come on.
[clears throat]


I was kind of a late bloomer too. [grunts]

I find that very hard to believe.

Yeah, well,
If it wasn't for Invisalign and Accutane,

you would not have swiped on me. [grunts]

Well, if it wasn't for Tag's photos,
you wouldn't have swiped on me.


You're actually doing great.
Yeah?

Yeah.
[gasps, screams]

[up-beat pop playing]

[Natalie] Do you have a hamper?
[Josh] It's over by the closet.

[clears throat]

Is this how you boil your victims?

Careful! Careful! Careful!
That's a wax warmer for candle-making.

It's very expensive.

Okay.

Grandma June makes candles?

Yes, it's one of her hobbies.

Josh Lin?

All right, fine, they're mine.

Guys can do things
besides hunt and pay for everything, okay?

Plus, I see this more
as a business than a hobby.

All right.
Wait, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

Let's see what you got. [grunts]
Come on!


Oh.

You see, candles
are solely marketed to women.

They all smell like flowers and candy

with names like "Sweet Caresses"
or "Shooting Star."

No self-respecting man's gonna buy those,

even if his apartment
smells like bong water.

So, I created my own line
of masculine candles

that captures the essence of a dude.

Yeah, I don't see "Compulsive Liar,"

"Left The Toilet Seat Up,"
or "Won't Ask For Directions" in here.

Make all the jokes you want,

but 50 percent of the US candle market
is underserved.

So, then why don't you serve them?

Because a business costs money.

Then ask your dad for a loan.
I feel like he's the target customer.

Have you met him?
Yeah.

The old Asian man upstairs?
Oh yeah.

manly things.

Plus, he and my brother
would just tease me about it.

[Natalie] You have a brother?
[man] Prodigal son has returned!

["Macho Man" playing]

Owen's here! Now it's Christmas!

[Barb] Owen! [laughing]
Mom! Mm!

[Barb] Merry Christmas, honey.

Merry Christmas. Look at what I got you.

[Barb] It's so good to see you!
[Bob] Honey! Wow!

Wow! Look at you!
[Chelsea] Merry Christmas!

You've been lifting those weights
I bought you. Huh? Yeah!

You've been so busy with the new house!
Okay. Game face.

Hey, Joshy!

What's going on, bro?
What's up, Owen?

Merry Christmas, man. [winces]
[Owen laughing]

[Josh laughing]
[Bob] Wow!

Oh, and, uh, who do we have here?

Oh, this is Natalie.

Oh, is she Grandma's new nurse?

No.
Ah! She must be in Mom's new book club.

No, she is...
[Owen] Oh shit. Shit. Uhâ€¦

Is this another intervention?

No, honey.
Natalie is your brother's girlfriend.


Oh, you'reâ€¦ you'reâ€¦ you're serious.

Really?

Really.
[Josh] Mm-hmm.

Oh! Well, that is awesome.

Yeah, we... You know,
we were just saying in the car, right?

We were just talking about it.
We talked about this for hours.

[Chelsea] Yeah. Yeah.
[Owen] How is Joshy still single?

Yeah, I mean, granted,
he still lives at home,

and the glasses
aren't doing him any favors.

No, they're not.

I am so pumped about this. Aren't you?
I'm so pumped.

Oh, we... This is a Christmas miracle.

Thank you so much, Natasha.


You know what?
The pleasure's all mine, Oren.

[Barb gasps] Oh, look at my little guy.

[Owen] Look at junior jumbo Josh.
Oh no.

We don't have to...
[Owen] Yes! You remember this one?

That is my favorite ornament of all time.

God, you were such a cutie, Josh.
Look at that rat tail. Do you see that?

He was such a cutie!

Those chubby little cheekies! [chuckles]
He was eight.

You know, I'm actually super grateful
for my awkward teenage years.

They helped me develop
resilience, empathy.

If it wasn't for that, I'd be,

I put it up every year.

It's, like, a tradition sort of thing.
It's no big deal.

Actually, I was thinking maybe
Natalie could put it up this year

since it's her first time here,
and she's our guest and all.

Uh, yeah, well, sure. Sure.

[smacks lips]

Thanks.
Yeah.

I think she cut me.
It's okay, baby. I think she did too.

Oh, I got her.

[Josh] Just right on top there.

I'm gonna help her.

No, I'm serious. Steal it back.

We gotta go. Don't want to be late.

Tag is fanatically punctual.

So, is the, uh, wall that we're climbing
like the one we climbed at your store?

Yeah. Pretty much.
Okay.

Natalie! You coming or what?

Yup. Definitely. Be right there.

You didn't tell me he was Tom Cruise.
Oh, I thought you were an aggro.

I can't do this.

Yes, you can.
Get this off me.

Get this off.
Don't undo that, come on.

Off! Off! Off! Off! Get this off me. No!
Just stop. Stop.

Stop. You got this, okay?

May I have everyone's attention, please?

May Iâ€¦ may I have
everyone's attention, please?

Owen and Chelsea,
I just wanna say congratulations.

Seeing you guys so happy in love
and now pregnant. [chuckles]

I mean, it's aâ€¦ it's a dream come true.

It's a dream
I never dared to have for myself.

Finding someone
to spend the rest of my life with.

It just didn't really seem
to be in the cardsâ€¦

Until I met Natalie.

Hmm?

[Barb gasps]
[Owen] Oh no.

[neighbors gasp]

What are you doing?

Get up.

Natalie. Iâ€¦ I know we haven't known
each other for that long...

No, we haven't. We really haven't.

But you know what they say.
When you know, you know.

[laughing nervously] I'm serious.

Natalie Bauer.

Stop it. Get up.

Will you marry me?
[Barb gasps]

Stop...

He doesn't even have a ring.

Yeah, you don't have a ring.

Just say yes. Just say it.

Jesus Christ.

You can take mine.
I don't have to be buried with it.

Oh, thank you, Grandma.

You're the best!

[chuckles nervously]

Natalie.

Will you?

Everybody's looking at us.

Say yes!
Yes! Yes!

[Josh whispering] Everyone's looking.
Just say yes.

We're not getting any younger, dear.

Yes.

She said yes!


Oh my God.
[Barb] Oh my goodness!

Oh, it fits perfect!

Oh!

You're making me the happiest boy...
We're the happiest family in town!

[Josh] Oh, thank you, Grandma.

Oh!
[Owen] It's crazy!

Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

[door closes]
Okay. Iâ€¦ I know you're mad,

but you told me to stand up for myself,
andâ€¦ and it worked!

I told you to stand up,
not get down on one knee!

This was not part of the plan.

I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry.
I got carried away in the moment.

But if you think about it,
nothing's changed.

Nothing's changed?

Your grandma gave me her ring


Still, we just gotta
make it through Christmas.

When you get back to LA,
I just tell them we didn't work out.

And then I look like the asshole?
Your family is gonna be crushed.

Don't worry. They're very used
to me disappointing them.

What about Tag?
I have a date with him tomorrow.

What if he finds out
I'm engaged to my cousin?

He won't. I promise you that. Okay?

Everything will be fine. Just trust me.

Trâ€¦ trust you? [scoffs]

That is literally
the one thing that I cannot do!


You wanted me to wear a hat.
You're like, "It's cute." It's dumb!

[door opens] Now I'm apparently
getting married! [door slams]

[sighs deeply]
[Owen] <i>I don't know about this Natalie.</i>

If she wants to be in our family,
I need to know who she is.

And I've been,

for like an hour and nothing.

[clicks tongue] Not being Google-able
is the modern equivalent

of driving a white,
windowless van by a playground.

I went to prom in a white windowless van.

Huh?

I think you should just let it go.

I mean, she's not that bad,
and Josh seems really into her.

Oh. Heyâ€¦ hey, Nat. Sweetie, I love you,
but I gotta go. My sponsor's calling.

Bye, sweetie. Love you.

Hey.

Kerry?



[Bob grunts]

Is everything okay?

Oh, uh, Natalie,
can you please hand me myâ€¦ my wrench?

[clicks tongue] Uh, yeah.

Here.
[Bob] Thanks.

No problem.


Whew.

Damn flue always gets stuck.

[Bob exhales]

Oh, would you like
to help me with kindling?

Sure.

[Bob grunts]

Just roll it lightly and scrunch.

[Bob chuckles]

Yeah, my dad didn't set fires unless
there was an insurance claim involved.

Who's that?

Oh.

Oh, that's my dad.

Yeah. He passed a few years ago.

Oh, I'mâ€¦

[Bob] Oh.
I'm sorry.

You know,
that man loved two things in this world,

his family and Christmas.

He used to climb up on the roof
every Christmas Eve and stomp around

so the boys knew Santa had arrived.

He fell off one year and broke his arm.
[gasps]

But he told the boys he broke it,
protecting their presents from the Grinch.

[both laugh]

He sounds like a great guy.

Yeah.

Hey, listen, umâ€¦

I just wanted you to know that

we're really happy
to have you joining the family.

[exhales deeply]

Okay. Well, enough of that. [chuckles]

Ready to give this bad boy a go?

Sure.

[Bob chuckles]

Oh. Okay. All right.

[birds squawking]

I've ever been on.


I used to come here every day
with my golden retriever, Chewy.

He passed away last year, actually.

I miss him every day.
Mm.

He would've liked this hike a lotâ€¦

Mm.

â€¦and you.


This has been nice.
I haven't been on a hike date in years.

Oh, this is not the date.
It's just a warm-up.

You ever been bobsledding before?
[rumbling]

<i>I'm not good at this kind of stuff, Josh.</i>

Okay. You just have to relax.

Relax? I can't relax. The tension
is the only thing holding me together.

Put in your AirPods,
and put on some music.

I don't know if I have them.

Actually, I think I have
something even better.

Oh, um, E-Rock says "pass the dutch."

E-Rock?

When did he get out of jail?

[Tag whooping]


[continues whooping]

How are you feeling back there, Natalie?

[Natalie spacey] Flying high back here.

[Tag whooping]

[door closes]

[footsteps approaching]
[Natalie humming]

[Natalie sighs happily]


Oh! I've never felt more alive!

Not only did Tag ask me to dinner
tomorrow night,

but I'm pretty sure I qualified for
the winter Olympics in Beijing. [chuckles]

Oh!


For the first time,

I met someone who's as perfect in person

as they are on paper. [chuckles, moans]

I hate to break it to you, but Tag
is actually far from being perfect.

In first grade, he had a lazy eye
and needed to wear an eye patch.


I'm just trying to point out
that in some cultures,

height and facial symmetry are repulsive.

[smacks lips] It's a good thing
I'm not part of those cultures.

Whatcha doin' over here?

Just mixing some new scents.


Smells like freshly cut grass.

Well, that one's called Lawn Mower.
[Natalie] Mm.

[inhales deeply]

Mmm.

Getting a feeling.

Bear with me. Umâ€¦ [sniffs]

It's like a... You know those [chuckles]
blue-collar mechanics guys

with the tight shirts,
that put in a hard day's work?

Jiffy Lube is what I'm calling it.

[smacks lips] You might want to rethink
the names, but you did nail the scents.

Oh, sorry, that's just for me.

Ooh. Yeah, well, looks like now
it's just for me.


Eucalyptus. I love eucalyptus.

And Old Spice.

And there's, like,
a tiny little tinge of, hmmâ€¦ gasoline?

What is this one?

Grandpa.

I started making candles
because of him in the first place.

You know they say a scent
can make a memory come alive.

So I made one of him.

It's lame, I know.

No.

It's not lame.

[soft piano music playing]

It's actually really sweet.

[panting] He's gone.
Are you sure?

I'm pretty sure that paperboy
is gonna get fired over this.

I'll give him a job at the store.
Oh, well, I hope he likes to travel.

That's an upgrade, I'd say.
[chuckles]

I think we got all of it.

Oh my God. [laughing]

I mean, Iâ€¦ I look like a deer
in the headlights in this photo.

[Josh] No, you don't. [breathing heavily]
Yes, I do.

It's a pretty decent photo of you, though.

Look at that.

Probably the only one in existence.


I know a lot of girls
who'd be very into you.

Well, they're definitely not
on FlirtAlert.

Do you still have
your original profile photos?

Oh my God, you do.
No.

Come on, show me.

I deleted the whole thing.
[Natalie] No, you didn't.

Please?

No. No.
I know you. I know you.

Okay. Okay.
Show me the photos!

[Josh exhales, sighs]


Dude. You're holding an ax.
You literally look like an ax murderer.

I was going for, like, a rugged look.

Okay.

[Natalie chuckles]

What? Who doesn't like a bathroom selfie?
I looked kind of cut that day. Look.

No one loves a bathroom selfie!
Also, why are you holding a wrench?

I was fixing the toilet downstairs.
Girls like guys who fix things.

[Natalie snickers]


Okay, okay. Come here. Come here.

Let's recap for a second. You're holding
a wrench, an ax, and some rope.

Were you actually trying
to find a girlfriend

or the person who murdered Colonel Mustard
in the library?

No wonder you only got three matches.
You were hiding your strengths.

And what strengths are those?

Well. [clears throat]

For one, you have very nice eyes.

You gotta show those puppies off.

And those teeth.

You have really straight teeth.

They're freakishly straight.

Well, five years of braces.

So then smile more!
[touching music playing]


There you go. [chuckles]

[laughing]
There it is.

I'm kidding. [giggles]

But more importantly,
you're a good guy, Josh.

Well, I don't know how
to show that in a photo.

Well, for starters,
you have to believe that it's true.

And then, once you do,

trust me,

it'll show.

[touching music continues]

Promise me that when this is all over,

you'll put up an honest profile
with real photos

that show the real you.

I promise.

[knocking on window]
I know you're in there, you mofos.

I can see the steam!

Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Sure you don't want to stay the night?
We're making a gingerbread house.

I'd meet him at eight.

Hmm.


What do you think?

Wow.

I know. I... It's the best
I could find in your mom's closet.

But I did have to make a couple
of alterations. I hope she doesn't mind.

No. You lookâ€¦

Perfect.


No need to oversell it.

So, where are you guys going tonight?
[smacks lips] Umâ€¦ Abbott's, I think.

You know that's a steakhouse, right?
Yeah. His parents own it.

Right, and you're vegetarian,

but Tag's a real
meat-and-potatoes type of guy,

and he likes his girls the same way.

Okay, so I'll eat a potato.

Worst case, maybe I'll have a little meat.

Yeah, don't you think
this is going a little too far?

No.

Okay. Pretending to like rock climbing
or a book, that's one thing.

But now you're compromising your beliefs.

Okay, relax. It's not like
I'm opening up a slaughterhouse.

Well, it's meat today, but then
what are you going to lie about tomorrow?

I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry. [scoffs] Lie?

Let's not forget the only reason I'm here
is because you lied.

I lied about a photo.
[Natalie] No.

You hid behind a photo.
You lied about your identity.

But it was still me.

Every conversation we had,
every text we exchanged,

every laugh we shared.

It was me.

You liked <i>me.</i>

And you like me so much,

you flew across the country
to surprise me for Christmas.

You're right. I liked you.

But you were a lie.

A piece of fiction.


[soft music playing]

Good evening. Any questions on the menu?

I will have the porterhouse.

And how would you like that cooked?

You know me. So rare,
a good vet could bring it back to life.

[laughing uncomfortably]

couldn't be with us tonight.

Where is she?

Uh, Abbott's.


Uh, she's justâ€¦ uhâ€¦ uhâ€¦ sampling
the menu, uh, for the wedding meal.

[Grandma, Barb] Mm.

Isn't that something you do together?

No, it doesn't matter what I like.

You know,
as long as she's happy, I'm happy.

Ah crap. I'm out of Twizzlers.

How can I build my beautiful roof
without Twizzlers?

I'm gonna head to the store real quick.

Uh, and I'll be right back.
Anyone need anything? No? No? Okay.

So, um, what do you think of the place?

[smacks lips, sighs]
It's really something.

You can see Bambi
without actually going to Disney World.

You know, I shot that one, actually.

Wow.
Yeah.

[Tag] What else do you like?

[smacks lips] Movies.

Specifically, <i>Die Hard.</i>

It is <i>the </i>greatest Christmas movie
of all time.

Well, cheers to that.


but Santa's actually kind of creepy
when you think about it.

He sees you when you're sleeping.
He knows when you're awake.

He always makes you sit on his lap.

Yep. Totally agree.

I mean, that guy is everything
that's wrong with Christmas.

It's pretty much why I don't celebrate it.


Oh, you're serious?
You don't celebrate Christmas?

No.

Stopped three years ago.

Why?
Because it's a total scam.

Okay.

Really? [softly] Okay.

to the house.

Everyone's sleeping.
[Tag] Okay.

but your car is a little loud.

[Tag scoffs]

Okay.

Well, I had a really nice evening.

I did too.

Thank you.

Thank you. Umâ€¦

Good night.

Good night.

[door closes]

[engine revving]


[soft guitar strumming]

[Natalie groaning]

There's cereal in there.

Hey, Josh, listen.
About what I said last night, I...

Look, you don't have to say anything.

No, I want to.

[Grandma] Hey, kids.
I shouldn't have...

I need your help.
Go get dressed, and meet me at the car.

Where are we going?

Shimmering Pines.

Come on, Grandma. Just ask Mom to help.
Okay? She loves that place.

I don't need your mom. I need you.


We're starting now.
We're going to start now, everyone.

We're going to be starting now.

Many of you've expressed
interest in online dating.

Well, I've brought you two experts.

My grandson, Josh,
and his fiancÃ©e Natalie.


They actually met online
and now are engaged.

[group exclaiming]

and talk to you about

the dos and don'ts of online dating?

Any questions?

How do I make it clear

that I'm not looking
for anything long-term?


Umâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I think that might be implied.

Do I have to mention my Parkinson's?

I think being honest
is always a good idea.

[woman] Oh.
What if I spruce it up just a little bit?

Instead of "has Parkinson's,"

I go with, uh,

"Always on the move."

[group chuckling]
Ooh, that's a good idea! I like that.

I want to avoid mentioning
that I'm in a wheelchair.

Then just change it.
Say, "I enjoy rolling with my homies."

Yeah! That's good.
Oh, that sounds really good!

Guys, Iâ€¦ I think you guys
got the wrong idea.

And will the fact that I live
in a nursing home turn off a lot of men?

[Josh] Uh.
Not necessarily.

Just say, "Into the group thing."

[group exclaiming]

And then Hank there
would prefer staying in over going out.

[group laughing, chattering]

Stop. Stop.

[group quiets]


Iâ€¦ I really, really do.

You wanna put your best foot forward.

You lived a full, vibrant life,
and you're a good person.

Traveled the world, fought in a war.

And Gladys, you met Sinatra.

I heard about your night at the Flamingo.


But then the insecurities creep in,
and you start with a slight exaggeration.

Still you, just a shinier version.

Butâ€¦ you like it.

So you tweak it just a little more

until the real you, which was probably
pretty great to begin with,

is unrecognizable.

[somber music playing]

But here's the thing.

You're not just fooling yourself.

There's someone else
on the other side of that lie

falling in love with a version of you
that doesn't exist.

And that's not fair

because the only way it ends for them
is disappointment.

And the only way it ends for you

is heartbreak.

If I've learned anything,

it's that love doesn't have to be perfect.

It just has to be honest.

Is "curvy" spelled with a Y or an EY?
[man] There's no E.

[indistinct chattering]

I guess I never realized.
I was so busy being mad at you

that Iâ€¦ I never stopped to think
about why you actually did it.

Look. Natalie,

theâ€¦ the why doesn't even matter anymore.

It was wrong. I shouldn't have asked you
to lie in the first place.

And I'm just gonna go to my family
and come clean with everything.

Wait, what? No.
No, no, no, no. You can't do that.

Josh, this isn't all your fault. I meanâ€¦

Besides, a deal's a deal.
We've made it this far.

It's only two days till Christmas.
Let's stage a breakup like we planned.

Don't worry, I'll sell it.

I don't know. Itâ€¦ it doesn't feel right.

Grandma, the car's that way!

Grandma! That's the wrong way!

Wait up!

Grandma, where are you going?

[woman whispers] Here they come.
[all] Surprise!


Oh, we are so excited
to have you join the family!


Your parents threw us
a surprise engagement party? Here?

Yeah. Not ideal.


Hi.
Hey.

What are you doing here?

Your aunt asked if we could throw
a surprise engagement party for Josh here.

I figured it's the least I could do.
Oh.

Where's the bride-to-be anyway?
I haven't met her yet.

She's doing the rounds.

Congratulations, dear.
Thank you. You look hungry.

Why did he just congratulate you?

Oh. You didn't hear?
Uh-uh.

I was the millionth customer
at the Supermart. Hmm.

Huh?
Free non-perishables for life.

Wow!
Yeah, lucky me!

I know a great charity that...
Do you know where the coat check is?

Yeah. Oh, okay. Uh-huh.
Do you mind taking that for me?

Thank you so much.
Youâ€¦ you look great, by the way.

Thanks. [sighs]

Hors d'oeuvres?


E-Rock! My mom really did invite
everybody in town. Huh?

Well, actually, I was just dropping off
your, uh, your lady's suitcase.

There's so much nice underwear in there.
You're a lucky guy.

I gotta say I'm surprised. [clears throat]

I didn't think it was gonna work out.

Duh, first class, honey.
I'm not a peasant.

No, Iâ€¦ I mean, um...

He never says anything
about his girlfriends, soâ€¦

Dad, come on.

Girlfriend. Wow.
It'sâ€¦ it's so, so nice to meet you.

go use the ladies' room.

Hey, not so fast. We need to talk.

I'm kind of busy, Owen.
Oh, talking to your lover, Tag?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw you two
here last night looking pretty damn cozy.

Okay, it's notâ€¦ it's not what you think.

Ah, that's funny,
because I didn't know what to think

until I spoke to your boss
a few seconds ago,

and now it all makes sense.

Okay, look, Iâ€¦ I can explain.

So the thing is...
La-la-la-laâ€¦

I don't want to hear it. I just want you
to stop this charade with my brother.

Two glasses of Veuve, please.

Tag, [burps] what's going on, bro?
What's up, E?

Can you believe
that J-Dog is getting married?

Chick's pretty cool too.
I haven't met her yet.

Well, she's right there.

Dude, that's his cousin.

I don't judge. You love who you love.

No. You know wh...

Why should I believe
what comes out of your mouth?

Are you serious...
Hey! Everything okay here?

No!
Yes.

Natalie, she didn't come to New York
for love. She came here for a story.

She's been playing you since day one, bro.

She's a writer for a Disaster Date column,
and you're not her fiancÃ©.

You are her subject.

Don't...
Wait. What? Nat.

What is he talking about?



I'm not one for speeches,
so I'll keep this quick.

Uhâ€¦

Josh.

I know we haven't always seen
eye-to-eye on things,

but you're a good kid with a big heart,

and after spending, uh, the last week
with your beautiful bride-to-be,

I think the whole family agrees
that you've picked a winner!

I couldn't be happier for you, son.

So let's all raise a glass
to future Mr. and Mrs. Lin,

Josh and...
No!

Not yet. Umâ€¦

Uhâ€¦

before all the speeches are done.

I mean, I'd like to add
to your beautiful, beautiful speech

with my own speech.

about, um, love, and, uh, Josh,

andâ€¦

Because that's what I've been,

dishonest

with Josh, and the Lins,

Tag,

everyone, really. I...

[Natalie sighs]


I met a guy online.

He was smart, funny, sweet,
and he looked like him.

So, I decided to come here
and surprise him for Christmas.

But when I got here,
I realized that the guy

I was really talking to was him.

I got catfished,

and I was furious.

But Josh told me
that he would help get me Tag

if I pretended to be his girlfriend
for the holidays.

And I honestly just...

Iâ€¦ I thought
that my perfect match was here,

so I agreed, and I pretended
to be someone that I'm not, butâ€¦



Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I can't lie.

I just can't, I'm sorry. Iâ€¦

I'm so sorry.

Do you even climb?

What about Thoreau?

I hate him.

Bobsledding?

I literally had to get stoned
to get through it.


for catfishing you,

and then you go
and do the exact same thing to me.

[breath trembling]

Congratulations.

Andâ€¦ and by the way,

<i>Die Hard </i>is not a Christmas movie.

[gasps]
[Tag] Yeah.

[crowd murmuring]

[door opens]

Okay, all right, show's over.
Nothing to see here, all right?

Okay? All right?

All right. Time to go home.
Stop looking at my brother.

<i>and maybe that's been the problem
all along. I mean...</i>

<i>I've been so focused
on other people's dishonesty</i>

<i>that I never really stopped
to look at my own.</i>

<i>And maybe if I did, I'd finally see
what's right in front of me,</i>

the ending to my story could beâ€¦</i>

It's the Mormons.

we're not converting!

["Curls" by Bibio playing]

{\an8}<i>â™ª To see within
Is to feel without a light â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Who'd have thought
That we'd break the things we like? â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª To find a stone
Just to bounce across the pond â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Is the path it makes
That's a clue to other songs â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Her hair, it curls
In the depth of the night â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª The scent recalls
Like a photograph with life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her hair, it curls
In the depth of the night â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª The scent recalls
Like a photograph with life â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª To live without
Is to live under a spell â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Who'd have thought
That we'd turn our home to hell? â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª To find a bone
And to float it down the stream â™ª</i>

So, what do we do now?

Kiss her, you idiot!
[Josh laughs]

<i>â™ª Her hair curls
In the damp of the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The scent recalls
Like a photograph with life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her woolen coat
Under yellow sodium lights â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Records the air like a memory of night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her hair, it curls
In the damp of the night â™ª</i>

<i>3,000 miles to see how my story ended.</i>

<i>And instead, I found out how it begins.</i>

<i>â™ª Records the air like a memory of night â™ª</i>

[Bob] Come over. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, this is not mine. This is Josh.

Owen! Owen!

[indistinct chattering]


I gotta warn you,

my family is pretty intense
when it comes to Christmas presents.

[Natalie scoffs]

You don't say.


Hey, you two.

Quick question. What's a dick pic?

Umâ€¦
[Chelsea] Ew!


[chuckles]
You want to take this one maybe?
