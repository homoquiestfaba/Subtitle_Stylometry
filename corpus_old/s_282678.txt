On the set of BATTLE ROYALE

Director Kinji Fukasaku
turns 70 years old.

Battle Royale is the 60th
film Fukasaku has directed.

OK, one more time.

Kick the second chair over there,
to the left of the window.

Tsukamoto,

look a bit more surprised,

because he’s aiming
the gun at you.

There was no tension the second time.

Should we shoot the second part?

The second part is exactly the same,
as the character's reaction.

If the second part comes in between

can we get the cut?
Is there already a difference?

It’s about the character's reaction,
not about the chair.

It’s got to be snappy...

we see the commotion
and crash, bang...

otherwise the cut is wrong.

Wait a second...

OK, once more!

Here you show no reaction.

Only on the other side.

Please show me a reaction.

OK, from here.

42 ninth-graders must fight
to the death in BATTLE ROYALE.

Cut! Put out the fire!

Over there are my classmates.

I’m in a film with Takeshi Kitano
directed by Fukasaku.

Is everything OK?

Sorry... everything’s fine.

Watch out for your elbow...

Tatsuya Fujiwara
as
Shuya Nanahara

What are you doing?!

The BATTLE part means
that we’re fighting each other.

Like the title says.
But what does the ROYALE mean?

How should the audience
understand that at first?

How come you have
so many wounds?

I won the Battle Royale.

The winner is a girl?

You all know the BR-Law?

Ai Iwamura
as
last year's winner

We killed our classmates,
until only I survived.

Today you will begin
killing each other.

Until only one of you survives.
There are no rules.

Don’t whisper,
you piece of shit!

Aki Maeda
as
Noriko Nakagawa

I used to be crazy about horror.

Killing each other,
it’s really horrible.

How was it when you turned 15?

Oh well...

I’ve forgotten.
That was over 50 years ago.

Right after the war?
-even before that.

Excuse me.
-Yes, after war.

What?
-No, nothing.

Hello, everyone in Class 9-B
from the Shiroiwa school!

You are the lucky class chosen
for this year's Battle Royale!

Congratulations!

You are on a deserted island
that looks like this!

Hachijou-kojima

Was this island inhabited?
-Yes.

People wandered over here,

but they left when there
was a water shortage.

Now the goats that they
left behind run wild.

That's not where he should be.

His position is farther up.
Ok, now move!

Noriko is behind him.

Noriko falls down.

Fujiwara notices her,
is surprised... now run!

I can’t really see where she fell.

Move Noriko's position
3 meters forward!

Back, back. 2 meters is better!

Noriko, please stay right there!

Please fall again!
Noriko, fall down right there!

Is that place OK?

Everybody listen!
Please stop fighting!

Please hear us out!

We found a way out of this,

if we all just meet here!

We don’t want to fight!

''We are really your friends''...

That sounded too much
like normal conversation.

''We are really your friends!''

Let’s put our head together!
-That was too fast.

It’s hard to understand
you from this far away!

We are really your friends!
-Even slower!

Friends!

More!

Let’s try to work together!

That last part was too fast.
Give a quiet pause!

''Don’t be stupid!
Don’t kill!''

''Let’s try to survive together!''

Here we are! Please come here!

Come over here!

It’s getting too late.

We’re finished for today.

Mr. Fukasaku seems young.

He just strolls up these high mountains.

You saw that?
-Ya. I thought, is that him?

He’s not sitting under the monitor?

Yukko always had Nanahara...
-No, Yumi!

''Please stop!''

As I read the script,

I thought, if there was a part,

that fit me, it was Kiriyamas role.

In Mr. Fukasaku’s film
it was decided,

how many people were
going to be killed.

A day before the script was bought,
Mr. Fukasaku suddenly wanted

the main character to brutally
kill a bunch of people.

I knew he was unpredictable
and so I was annoyed.

Who should brutally kill people?
Kiriyama? -Yes.

He said:
''I like the abnormal.''

I think Kiriyama is
fascinated by murder.

and enjoys playing the game.

What did I do?!

It wouldn’t be right...

to tell this story...

without showing the violence...

This opinion of censoring violence...

I do not agree with such an opinion.

During the student’s movement
we had no weapons.

We were unarmed

and helpless when the
police hit us with clubs.

In those days,
when the batons came out

I thought, ''Shit!''
It was very unfortunate.

Why didn't we remember
to bring weapons?

It was very regrettable.

Why didn’t we have batons?

''Stop whispering!''

Then throw the chalk.

Is that okay?
-But we get to choose it.

Is everybody ready?
-Yes.

Ready...! And action!

This country is at an end!

The reason is...
Don’t whisper!

The chalk really hit me.

He said it was a prop,
but it was real.

I could only smile bitterly.

An actor must be able to
obey instructions well.

If the director says it’s OK,
it’s OK.

An actor must only do,
what he is required to do.

The mental part of acting is hard

Precise concentration.

I act the way I am, because
that’s the way he wants it.

I didn’t understand it at first.

But he said,
the teacher has my image,

so I try to play it as
naturally as possible.

Sit down!

I finally died.

But it was an honor for me,
because Mr. Kitano killed me.

The island is about
10 square kilometers.

Fujiyoshi!

Don’t whisper!

Move, out of the way...

Sorry, it’s against the rules
for me to kill you.

Would I really play the game?

I would probably kill myself.

Why? -Because I wouldn’t be
able to kill anyone else.

Osamu Onishi
as
Yoji Kuramoto

How should kids act?

Nice to others and gut.

Also sensible. Normal.

If his friend stepped on an ant,
he should say:

''Stop! That’s a living being too.''

Still a little bit lower.

The branches are still swinging...
too much movement.

Ya... I don’t know...

Very difficult... hard...

Whether I’d do it?

Some would flee,
others would kill themselves.

I wouldn’t kill myself.

I’d look for a way out.

Why did you do that?

It’s your fault.

You disrespected adults.
You’ll be quiet now.

But don’t forget:
Life is a game.

So fight to survive
and find out

exactly what you’re worth.

ACTION!

A bit open!
The eyes are good.

Ryo Nitta
as
Kyouichi Motobuchi

...Square minus 4 ac...

You want to fight?
You will see!

I’m going to survive!

The second face of the
class representative.

Since the beginning of the year
I continuously hurt myself.

First I got hit by a car.

And after everything healed,

I fell down the steps
at the train station.

Shin Kusaka
as
Yoshio Akamatsu

I don’t have to roll down anymore...

There should be a mat.
-No, there's nothing.

So, we’re rolling.

And... Action!

Let’s do it once more.
It could always be better.

Are you okay? - Yes!

Daredevil!

No!
Why are you all like that?!

What did I do to you?

Think about it, what did
you all did this whole time?

I always hated you.
I’m gonna kill you!

You are all sad that your friends
have died. Heads high!

The sound was deafening.
I didn’t want to react,

but it was so awful,

going off repeatedly in my face.

That was not acting,
that was real.

Yutaka Shimada
as
Yutaka Seto

Mr. Fukasaku acts so young!

He’s still wide awake,
and it’s almost midnight!

My grandmother is already asleep.

Attention! And action...

Scornful sneer...

You must exaggerate
and then suddenly stop.

Otherwise you miss the effect.

Ya, like that...

You thought,

you good-for-nothing could
join the class trip?

That’s a good start.

Basically okay.

Once more.

It really hurt after a while.

Kotohiki, is that you?

Kotohiki, answer me!

Takayo Mimura
as
Kayoko Kotohiki

Let me take it.

Why are you following me?

How embarrassing...

Say it already!
-I can’t do that...

I have a crush on you.

I have a crush on Kotohiki.

The hanging scene...

Tomomi Shimaki
as
Sakura Ogawa

Yauomi Sano
as
Kazuhiko Yamamoto

I don’t want to play the game.

No, that that won't work!

At the cut your left foot
must come right here.

Yes, like that.

And take the bag
at the right time.

That wasn’t good.

I thought it was good.

I want to grab it faster.

Fujiwara surprised me.

Me too. The rage he plays
is very cool. I thought,

it was great to look good.

But he not only looks good,
he's a good actor too.

He is really good.

I’m bad.
-I don’t think so.

I was bad. –When?

When we were in the lighthouse.
-I wasn’t good there either.

You act very well,
you have no worries acting.

Is this your first leading role?

I’ve acted in too much theater.

If you only do theater,

you tend to overact your
gestures and facial expressions.

That’s embarrassing.

When I only show a small reaction,

the director says, I should
show more, like Sugimura.

Then my reaction is exaggerated.

What should I do,
if everyone says:

''Her acting is so corny?''

I always tell myself ''So what''
as I watch it.

Watching is easy,
but acting is totally different.

''Look, she’s making herself cry''
or something.

Yesterday in a scene,

it was really hard for me to cry.

Tears just flow for Kotohiki.
But for me... nothing.

I asked Ando,
how he cries.

He said, he doesn’t believe,

that you can just ''act''if
you want to cry convincingly.

Really?

Some people cry all day,
all the time,

while others suppress it.

But both types of people
are still sad, right?

So you don’t express all of
your sadness when you’re alone.

That’s what he said,
and it really touched me.

Is this film just between us?

But everyone should see it.

Really? Is that because
the film is too gruesome?

It would be awful,
if schoolkids copied it,

like, throwing a knife,

but everyone should see it.

You’re saying the film is
worth seeing?  -Yes?

I like the film, because...

besides the fighting...

there’s love...

the core feelings
humans can experience.

People should relate to the theme
of harassment in the schools

because they can imagine
themselves as the victim.

It would be cool,

if the film makes people
look back and reflect on it.

We can fight each other,

or we can stop and work together.
I like that about the film.

To die...

for the one you love,
transcends age.

Even kids...

can express love like that...
wholeheartedly, right?

Ya.

Even students can
express mature love.

We love each other passionately!

We have an ax,

a knife, a gun,
a sword, an icepick...

Did you fall in love right away?

No, I didn’t.

Or, ya.

Yes, you did? -Ya.

How long did it take?
Are you now in love?

Is that a serious question?

My dream...

is to lead a happy life.

I want to have a job that I enjoy,

even if I don’t make much money.

I want to concentrate
more on basketball.

I should have gone
to the championship,

but right before the game

I hurt my foot

and I couldn’t play
in the final match.

That is too slow...
too slow...

Are you in love? –In love?
That’s my little secret.

Is it someone in the cast?

I’m not interested in anybody here.

What a shame!
-Or maybe I’m kidding?

Fall the right way,
or we’ll be shooting forever.

Good job.
It is now 5 o’clock...

We often talk to each other

about what we would all do,

if we had to fight in
this death match for real.

I would probably hide.

And shoot anyone!

Anyone who got in the way.
-That’s mean. That would be mean.

Anything to survive.
-But that’s definitely a way to do it.

I probably couldn’t save
anyone from being killed.

Not even a friend.

The ''Battle'' begins!

I will avenge Nobu.

Instead of him...

I’ll have to protect you to the end.
-Thank you, Nanahara.

That performance was lifeless,
you two.

Too sentimental.

You shouldn’t show any
feelings at the end.

The audience doesn’t feel that.

What should we do about the ship?

Let it sink!

The lead part that Tatsuya plays,
is also a person,

who is torn between
justice and friendship

and nothing can be done.

I think, in terms of violence...

He’s only hanging around.

He doesn’t embody heroism,
like in the novel.

Like a very naïve person

he drags himself around against
his own will in such a way

and at the end, he asks himself,

why he did it.

We do not find an answer.

We leave the question open,

about what type of
protagonist Nanahara is.

Are you OK?
Ya. Send Nakagawa over here!

Take care of it yourself.

You’ll begin on Mr. Noro’s signal

when we do the real take.

Don’t use the big ones.

A Camera... B Camera... ready?

Ready up there?
Then let’s go.

Mark!

Everything’s fine?
-Yes, everything’s OK.

Are camera A and B both OK?
-Ya!

What...?

It first came to my attention

because I’m the oldest.

I decided,

to make a nice circle
and I suggested,

that we go to a café
near the studio.

But the girls were apprehensive.

So only the guys
ended up in the café.

Later, the girls told me,

that they had thought
I was being a playboy.

What’s that all about?

What, you?

Great big reaction.

That’s great.
-Lots of blood, tons.

I was shot 20 or 30 times.

Did you die?
-Ya.

How many? -About 4 or 5.

4 or 5...

Not many til now.

Even the girls are fighting each other.
-Times are changing.

Even the girls are fighting.
Equal rights.

Even a girl attacked you?
-Ya.

And she tried to kill you?
-Ya.

I think Mitsuko is strong enough,

to fight in the ''Battle Royale''

Who’s there?

Ya... It’s OK?

Your weapon.
Was it already used?

Yoshimi and Kuramoto are next door.
They’re both dead.

They’re hanging all cozy next
to each other. But not me!

I won't end up like that!

Beautiful day today!

The color won’t go away.

I’ve already betrayed my friends.
-How come?

It’s a secret.
-A secret?

Yup, my secret.

I’ll only take so much bullying.

Really? -Ya.

I didn’t see the scene.

Can you tell me what happened?

I was threatened with a knife

and ran away.
But Chigusa ran after me.

And then something awful happened?
-Ya.

I was stabbed here twice,
and also twice here.

Wait, should she grab here?

Show me a new Chiaki Kuriyama.

Ya, do it like that.

Just a close-up of the knife?
-No, the whole thing is good.

I agree.

Always blaming someone else!

That's why I hate your guts.

I'll resist you
with my whole body!

What if this was real?

I think,

I’d be scared and hide.

I wouldn’t know if
I could trust my friends

or whether I would stay
together with them.

I would stay by myself.

It’s easier to be alone.

Is that on?

An interview ...

Why do you think Kawada
can kill so many people?

Good question... I don’t kill
senselessly. I’m defending myself.

Oh ya, sure, whatever.
-It’s self-defense.

Besides, why did you kill?
I didn’t kill anyone.

I didn’t have to murder.

I didn’t kill anyone.

I didn’t have a weapon
-What’s your weapon?

What’s your weapon?
-A gun.

Mine’s poison.
-Oh, so you’re the one...

the mass murderer!

I’m innocent!
-Guilty!

What did you do?
-I only cooked the stew.

How terrible. And you?
-I did the dishes.

What’s wrong?

Who, who was it?
-Satomi, no!

We're the only ones here! Chisato!
you cooked it, right?! -Haruka too!

You think I killed her?!

Cut it out!
Satomi, lower that gun!

You're suspicious yourself!

Haruka!

You didn't sleep at all the
last 2 nights, did you?

It just means you don't trust us
-I forgot my sleeping pills...

Insomina at your age?! -Cut it out!
Satomi, lower that gun!

''Shut the fuck up!'' Bang!

''Shut the fuck up!''

Shut the fuck up!

Sorry...

Even if the soup sprays you,
stay in character!

Shut the fuck up!
Cut the leadership crap!

Chisato...
-You screwed up the poisoning!

How can you say that?!

You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

Hold it higher.
Once more!

Not like that... Like this!

I hope you can do it.

Shut up! Cut the leadership crap!
Chisato...

You screwed up the poisoning!
-How can you say that?!

You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

Sayaka Kamiya
as
Satomi Noda

Excuse me.

Was it you?
-''Was it you?!''

Ya, like that.

Can you remember to hold it
like that... along this line?

I think it’s stupid to
betray your friends.

I would run away.
I couldn’t kill anyone.

In reality it’d be different.
-She’d really kill.

In this situation...

I’d save myself first.

I think there isn’t a choice.

I would figure out how to react

and if I needed to be deceptive.

You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

Thanks.

Attention everybody, stay there!
We’re gonna take a photo!

The ninth grade

has a special meaning for me.

The war in the pacific ended
with the surrender of Japan,

when I was in the ninth grade.

About a month before
the end of the war

the US troops started bombing us.

It was hopeless to run away or hide.
It was all around us.

We were all turned around...

About thirty people

were killed.

The dispossal

of the corpses was assigned us,
the ninth graders.

We had to collect the
dismembered limbs.

Only one will survive.

During every air raid,
every bombing,

we sought shelter under
our friends’ bodys.

I thought it was better to die,

than to always live in fear,

but when the time came,
I’d hide myself again.

When it was all over,
we didn’t feel shame

but we were silent

and we’d lick our wounds.

Today I would like...

Ouch! It hurts...!

I'm bleeding, dammit!

Look who's talking?!

Shut the fuck up!
You tried to steal the gun,

so you're guilty!
Take this!

Once more.
-There are no rules.

What’s so funny?

''Hey, what’s going on, lzumi?''

''Open the door!''

I can’t take any more.
I probably pulled a muscle.

15 years old, Summer

The battle continues

Some people protect,
others murder.

Some kill themselves.

Nanahara lets the others
kill themselves.

It was an interesting
Century for me.

Thinking back to the end of the
war, it would be interesting,

if everything was burned up
and the Earth was totally flattened.

That would be interesting.

Takeshi Kitano
as ''Teacher Kitano''

What’s the main reason
you are in this film?

The producer came to me and said,
the teacher is just like me.

I said, he’s like ME?

The director is Fukasaku.

And when he asked me,
I really wanted to be in his film.

Then I found out that the
teacher’s name was ''Kitano''

That was a shock to me.

I not only had the role,
but I was playing myself.

What was the intention of the director,
to let you play yourself?

Even the written symbol was the same.
-The Kanji character?

Ya. The teacher shared my identity!

Even the foreign spelling
was the same way I spell it.

So it really meant
I was playing myself.

Still, Fukasaku gave me very detailed
directions about the character.

Ya, in that last short scene
he gave you so many instructions.

He’s definitely the most energetic.
-Ya, really.

All the others drop from exhaustion.
But not Fukasaku.

Everyone else is tired, but he’s fit,

even though he’s the oldest.
-Ya, exactly.

I think it’s his passion.

His feeling for the film.
Everyone’s in awe of him.

Really it’s just an image.

I play up my image,

that I’ve created
through film and TV.

But that’s not how I really am.

I thought,

I should act like I normally do.

Since he rarely objects,
I’d probably be OK with that.

Compared to the character in the novel,
you play the teacher very seriously.

How should I explain it...

He wanted me to play it this way.

Oh, ya?

Ya. Trying it out during
rehearsals we had different takes.

He’d say: ''Do it like this'',
I’d think, OK.

There’s also a funny side to you,

the comic ''Beat'' Takeshi?

During a scene,
he’d look at the monitor,

and ask me,
how I should act.

I’d die laughing. But not
at the beginning of the film.

What do you think, as a director,
about the themes of violence and death?

The meaning of the film...

But I'm just an actor in this film.

I won’t try to explain the meaning...

or think about the production.

I don’t want to interfere
with the director.

''Shouldn’t that come earlier?''
That would be rude.

I act like he says.

I only grasp the general
meaning of the film.

I don’t think about the big picture.

In one scene you throw
chalk at the students,

and then a knife,
killing a student.

Did you act heartlessly?

The teacher loses it gradually.

In the beginning, only the
students are out of control

and the teacher endures
them with firm patience.

But under certain circumstances

even the adults get pissed off.

I think that’s how it
is in this film.

When something like that happens,
then adults get cruel.

Now about Teacher Kitano

Yesterday, I acted
like I was stabbed

by a poor kid with a knife.

This makes the teacher
a multi-faceted character.

Yes, indeed...

A man, who is dangerous and
lovable at the same time.

The scene in the river
bed is a good example.

Yes that scene...

Here he dreams about,
how it should be. The ideal.

Ya.

Basically...
the teacher is always like that.

Whether it’s then or now.
Even this teacher is that way.

Internally, he’s always thinking
about his students.

And I believe...

He breaks out of
that unintentionally.

That’s how I fell.

How was it, when
you were 15 years old?

From second to sixth grade,

I always had the same teacher.

Her name was Mrs. Fujisaki

and I was totally in love with her.

And then...

by the ninth grade, I didn’t
care about school any more.

It meant a lot to me...

that the school system...

was closed.
School should be a place,

where students can study safely.

Talented students were
especially supported,

and the rest of the
students were troublemakers.

A smart group
and a stupid group.

I was in the stupid group
and made trouble for the teachers.

But in my opinion...

it’s worse today than
it was back then.

Back then, there were 60 students
in a middleschool class.

16 classes with 1000 students.

Ya, that’s right!

That was the era of
the baby boomers.

After every exam...

they’d hang up the names
of over 900 students.

The best and worst scores
were always the same.

The best student went on to
the University of Tokyo,

the most renowned in Japan.

The worst student, the crazy idiot,
is in a nut house these days

and not still in school.

So altogether about 1000 students?

The worst were pure evil.

Sometimes even Yakuza bosses.
There was everything.

There was a difference,
but also much more energy.

Back then the teachers didn’t
know all of the students.

I’m often visited by old classmates

and if I ask which class,
they’ll say, ''class 15''.

I don’t him,
I was in class 2.

We only remember the
best and the worst.

''If we’re struck by a former student,
then we will show them more affection.''

Do you build you performance
upon your own experiences?

Ya... back then, violence was...

a kind of connection...

or communication, you know?

Nowadays violence is only
punishing the body. And so...

The teacher gave the kids
a slap on the head

in order to communicate a point.
Not as punishment.

That’s the big difference.

But the worst are people,
who just watch violence.

Ya, passive viewers,

who watch objectively from above,

you know, really watch,

they’re the most powerful.

They commit the strongest violence.

Violence is always there anyway.

You hit or you don’t.
But just watching is dangerous.

Those who let others hit.

Were you trying to be funny
when you fell in the water?

Sure... I meant to fall down there.

Slip or what?
-And fall.

That will probably be cut out.
-Probably.

How was it to work with
another generation?

Oh... actually the students
and I are together over here,

and the director is up here.

I only act according to
his direction.

It’s really hard for
the students though.

They’re getting a lot of
instructions, every time.

Also the long rehearsals...

But that is the world
of the director Fukasaku.

What is your impression
Fukasaku as a director?

The energy.

He has more energy than me,
even though he’s older.

Also his pacing.

I make pauses twice as long
as he does between lines.

He often said: ''Mr. Takeshi,
please act twice as fast.''

I think his perception of time
is twice as fast as mine.

I had to make the pauses between
sentences extremely short.

It was almost impossible,

to act slowly and methodically.

All of his films are like that.
His rhythm is faster.

Always more text in less time.

I take a lot of time,
sometimes even too much.

There are different
points of view.

I don’t know,
whose idea it was,

to give the director a monitor.

Now he sees it in the monitor
instead of through the camera.

Before he’d only see the picture
and say OK.

But now he can pays attention to
the tiniest little things.

He watches the actors,

the moment they aren’t speaking.

Then he’d say:
''Why are you making that face?''

Or: ''Go over there...''
He is now very precise.

My cameraman will soon be
working with Fukasaku.

I asked him, why he brought that stand.
For the monitor, he says.

I say: ''Then it takes longer.''
And it does.

On a shoot with 40 people,
I’ve already lost interest.

I say, if it’s not in the picture,
then it’s not important.

But not everyone agrees.

Kurosawa and other directors
all did it the same way.

They are insanely precise.

Press Conference

Welcome to this press conference.

Filming began on July 20.

The production has gone
very well so far,

and shooting is scheduled to be
completed by the end of August.

We will be in Warsaw Poland
on October 4th, 5th, and 6th,

to record the film score

with the Warsaw Philharmonic.
On October 29 the film will be finished.

We are happy that the
production company,

and the studio could arrange
this press conference.

Thank you for your patience...
Now let’s invite the cast and crew

of Battle Royale to please join us.

Please come on in!

Coming in first, is the director,
Mr. Fukasaku. Many thanks.

Followed by the actors
and the author of the novel.

They’re all here so you
can take your photos now.

The film BATTLE ROYALE
from Toei, Amu Associates,

Kobi, Nihon Shuppan Hanbai,

Wow Wow and
Gyaga Communications

is a joint production
of these seven companies.

Let’s first talk to the author,
Koshun Takami, about the original novel.

The book was a bestseller.
It sold over 300,000 copies,

and it sparked a lot of
controversy. Welcome Mr.Takami.

I’m really a first-time writer.

It’s bit surreal to be sitting
on a panel next to Mr. Fukasaku

and these famous stars.
It truly is unreal.

I’m thankful,

to work with them on this film.

Thank you all for being here today.

The director is Mr. Fukasaku,

an icon of Japanese film.
This is his sixtieth film.

Welcome Mr. Fukasaku.

Thank you all for coming today,
despite this terrible heat.

''You can’t turn back time.''

This is my guiding philosophy.

Sometimes I think to myself:
'' Don’t think about your age!''

Oh well... recently,

I have been thinking
about my own life.

When I read this book,

that deals with 42 students
murdering each other,

it was really quite a shock.

These kids lives were very similar,
and yet so different...

to my own personal experiences,

as a student during the war.

My experiences and the book
came together like that.

I knew I had to make
the book into a film.

Still my own experiences
are quite different from those

of these young actors,

and we had to communicate
those differences to each other...

That was something I
always had to consider.

I must admit,

they acted wonderfully.

I think it’s interesting

that Mr. Takeshi and I

almost crossed career paths
ten years ago.

I regret that we wasted
so much time between then and now.

But I’m glad that
we finally met again

and that this time we were able
to work together. Thanks.

Thank you very much.
That was Mr. Fukasaku.

He was supposed to direct the film
''Violent Cop'' ten years ago,

but he fell ill so the film’s star,
Takeshi Kitano, directed it instead.

Mr. Fukasaku said from then on,

they were both very determined
to work together on a film

and this was their first chance.

Let’s now pass the microphone
to the actor Tatsuya Fujiwara

who played the character Shuya
Nanahara without a stuntman!

I cried the first time
I read the book.

And I cried again,

when I read the script.

It’s just so emotionally moving.

I hope a lot of people
will go see the film.

I hope every Japanese person
gets a chance to see it.

I think,

this team of filmmakers was
so enthusiastic and devoted.

My impression of the director,
Mr. Fukasaku, is...

He’s more lively than us
and he has so much energy.

His energy rubs off on us.

If we were dead tired,
his vigor would wake us up.

During breaks between shots,
I’d feel tired,

but I’d look over at the director...

and his energy would jumpstart me.

That kept me going
until the next morning.

Miss Aki Maeda
plays Noriko Nakagawa,

who is secretly in love
with Fujiwara.

I play Noriko Nakagawa.

She’s a stubborn girl,
who always goes against the flow.

She has her own set of values.

As the story plays out...

her friends have
all killed each other,

and none of the other students know

if they can depend on each other.

She’s scared of being alone,

but she doesn’t trust anyone else.

In this situation...

she can only believe in the boy
that she has a crush on.

She does things her own way.

I think she’s a very strong girl.

Director Fukasaku

was always wide awake,

even though we shot
all day, every day.

Since I arrived on the set,

I could feel his energy
boost me up. Thank you.

And now Taro Yamamoto,
who plays Shugo Kawada.

Thanks. I’m Taro Yamamoto.

When I first went to the audition,

I heard that the lead role
was a ninth-grader.

So I thought,

I’d be playing a
PE teacher or something.

But then they asked me,

to read for the part of the ninth-grader.
I thought, this is crazy.

But I did it anyway, and I figured: ''There’s no way I'll get this part.''

During the audition,
we rehearsed the different lines

and the director had already
given detailed instructions

about how we should act
even during the audition.

I thought the audition went pretty well
but I didn’t expect much.

They told us they’d decide that night,

and we’d find out the next day
if we got the part or not.

But a few weeks passed before
I found out that I got the role

of a ninth-grader even though
I was already 25 years old.

I thought, Fukasaku must be crazy.

Sorry about that...

What really inspired me though,

Fukasaku was using a cane
at the time of the audition.

And when rehearsals started,

he still had the cane,

but at some point,
he just dropped the cane

and started running around.
He could run so fast,

and I thought, is he crazy?

I’d see that and think,
something’s gotten into him.

Even though he’s 70 years old,

he still works so passionately.

I’d love to be like him.
I really mean that!

Next is Masanobu Ando,
who plays Kazuo Kiriyama.

This time I was playing a
character that was even younger
than my very first role,

so I was a bit hesitant...

But I accepted the part anyway.

I realized, it was probably the
first and only chance I’d get

to wear a school uniform in a film.
And I figured I’d enjoy it.

I think there’s something beautiful
about being able to live

and do whatever you want.

Ya, really, it’s not so bad to be older.

And finally let’s greet
Takeshi ''Beat'' Kitano,

who plays a teacher,
also named ''Kitano''.

He makes the 42 students
kill each other.

Good afternoon.

The title of the film is
BATTLE ROYALE

which is a fight to the death.

If you came to the set
of a Fukasaku film,

you’ll see for yourself
what we mean by ''Battle Royale''.

The director’s assistant ran away,

The entire crew has
collapsed from exhaustion.

I thought,

is anyone here gonna make
it out in one piece?

I was only there a
few times this month.

But when I came back yesterday,

the whole crew had aged so much...

like almost 20 years it seemed.

Only the director, Fukasaku
is still energetic.

Apparently all that
Philopon (Chinese meth)
he’s been taking works really well.

Seriously, he’s a
fantastic director.

He really is unbelievable.

He’d asked me if I
would be in the film.

I knew about the book,
and I knew the character of the teacher.

He said he wanted me for the role
and I accepted it.

Then he said he wanted to use

my name for the teacher’s character.

I thought, great,
now I’m playing myself.

But even the Katakana
was the same as my real name.

As we began filming

I realized that it was a good thing,

that we hadn’t worked
together ten years ago.

I wouldn’t have started
my own career as a film director,

if he had been able to
direct that film.

Isn’t it great how it worked out?

He really is very energetic
and it shows in everything he does.

It’s especially visible
in his films.

They’re always exciting.

Thank you very much. Mr Takeshi
is on the set four days this month

and tomorrow, August 17th
is his last day of shooting.

We wish you all the best of luck.

Thank you very much.
