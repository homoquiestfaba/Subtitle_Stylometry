(calm and serene music)

How often do you
come out here?

Whenever I can't handle
my mom anymore.

I bet that happens a lot.

Thanks for coming.

Sure.

Seems like a cool place.

(calm and relaxing music)

So you're the kind of kid who
hangs out in places like this?

Nah, I'm not like
creepy or anything.

Relax dude, I was
just kidding.

Simon.

Simon?

Where are you?

Simon.

(Simon yells loudly)
(girl shrieks)

You are a freak!

Sorry, I thought it
would be funny.

(girl giggles)

Is this how you get
all your girlfriends?

What do you mean?

You know, you take him
out to a spooky house,

then they think you're
all dark and interesting?

No, I've never taken
anyone here before.

Never know with guys like you.

What are guys like me?

I don't know,

mysterious.

Or maybe just a normal nerd.

Haven't decided.

(exhales forcefully)
I wish I was mysterious.

At least I'd be a little
more interesting.

What do you do?

What?

How do you get guys
to fall for you?

Who do you think I am?

Um.

(girl giggles)

So,

what if I really did bring
you here to impress you?

I figured.

It's cool.

Consider me impressed.

We should hang out more.

Yeah, I hope.

My mom doesn't like me
going out very much.

Ah,

she's one of those.
(chuckles softly)

No my dad died a year ago so

she likes to keep me close.

Oh.

Sorry.

No, you don't have
to be sorry.

I kinda sorta wish
we can get out

of this stupid neighborhood.

Yeah.

I'd just go to my uncle's.

He has a farm and everything.

Sounds nice.

You should go then. I would.

No, I can't just leave my mom.

She hates my uncle.

You're sweet.

It's a shame.

(gun fires loudly)

[Man] Get back here!
You're dead!

I thought you said no
one came here.

Yeah, we should go.

(girl giggles)

I'll see you later.

(calm but somber music)

Simon?

Hello Simon.

Where were you this morning?

[Simon] Just went for a walk.

Did you check the mail yet?

What's that?

Nothing.

Let me see.

Mom! Stop!

Oh.

Mom, that was mine!

Why would you even want this?

Because he sent it to me!

Your uncle doesn't
care about you.

Yeah, at least we'd
have food there.

I'll handle the
shop today Simon.

Take the rest of the day off.

I'm sorry.

Mom!

(calm but foreboding music)

So, how it go with Jen?

Alright I guess.

Bet she thinks
you're a weirdo.

What you mean?

You know,

taking her first thing
in the morning

to a creepy ass house.

Sounds rapey to me.

I thought I had work
later, it make sense.

No it doesn't.

She definitely thinks
you're a creep.

We haven't had a
customer in two weeks.

How come?

I don't know.

Guess people don't wanna pay
us to fix their stuff anymore.

Sucks man.

That's why I'm leaving.

This place is done.

Are you sure your
brother's is gonna be better?

I just assumed it would

but I don't know really.

I remember you telling me
you didn't have much space

but if me and mom can
help you guys out.

Dude, I told you.

I'd bring you if I could.

You won't even know I'm there.

You eat, don't you?

Take showers?

Sorry man, it's not
gonna happen.

Why don't you move in
with your uncle?

We should.

You know I'd help if I could.

Yeah, I know.

(thunder roars loudly)

(soft and gentle piano music)

[Simon's Mom] Simon!

Get in the basement!

(moves into still and
foreboding music)

(object smashes wood)

(people mumble angrily)

(loud smashing)

(calm but somber music)

What are you doing?

I'm tired.

I'm gonna go take a nap,

from there we're gonna
get back to work.

Get back to what?

We have a shop to run.

Mom there is no shop!
You saw it!

We've had this family
business for years,

I am not giving up yet!

Yeah, well,

maybe it's time.

You know, we're
almost out of food.

How do you expect to
pay for anything else?

We've always gotten by.

Well, maybe we can't
control that anymore.

And Roberto has room for us.

He abandoned us.

We're his family and he left.

How are we a family?

It's just the two of us.

There's no one here

and no one cares.

You really wanna go,
don't you?

I don't wanna be here anymore.

Well, maybe you
should go then.

What are you talking about?

This place has
nothing to offer you,

maybe you should just go.

Mom,

please don't talk like that.

You hate it here.

I don't hate it here.

Yes you do.

You haven't been the
same since your father.

Yeah, but neither than you.

You're right.

Look Simon, I can't
provide for you.

Mom, don't talk like that.

We can go together and
find something.

It doesn't have to be
a Roberto's.

You don't understand.
I don't want to.

I'm done.

I'm not living my life as
a burden to you.

Mom, you're not a
burden to me.

I love you.

I love you too, Simon.

What are you gonna do?

I'll be here.

I've been here my whole life.

I'm not going anywhere.

But that doesn't mean
that you should stay.

You could make
something of yourself.

(serene but foreboding music)

(fist knocks softly on door)

Uh hey, what's up?

Can I talk to you?

Yeah, sure.

What's going on?

Do you wanna leave?

Now?

My uncle needs help
at his farm,

we can go together.

What are you talking about?

He says it's awesome out there

and there's tons of food
and places to sleep.

Is something going on?

I know it sounds crazy,
but I think it could work.

Simon, I can't just
leave with you.

Why not?

This is my home

and I've only known you
for a couple of days.

So what?
We like each other, right?

I've liked plenty of people,

but that doesn't mean I'd
abandon my life

and run away with them.

What?

Did you think we're
together or something?

I don't know, I.

Simon.

Honestly, you're nice.

You got this stuff
with your mom and

I just don't think you
and me are gonna work out.

I see.

I'm not trying to be
mean or anything but

you need to think
things through.

You aren't being rational.

Okay.

Wait, are you really going?

Do you any idea how bad
it is out there?

I guess I'll find out.

(calm and serene music)

(soft and somber song
plays over intercom)

Excuse me.

Can I help you?

Yeah I was wondering if
you knew of any places around

where I could sleep?

Are you gonna buy anything?

No sir, I don't
have any money.

Neither do most people.

Get the fuck out of my store.

[Man] Alright, try it.

(engine whirls and whines)

Nope.

Darn it! God! (mumbles)

Hey! Hey you!

Yeah you, come here.

Hey, give me a hand with this.

Can you please hold
this for just a second?

[Simon] Yeah.

Alright. Here we go.

This is it.

One more time, one more time.

Alright, try it now.

(engine whirls and whines)

Damn it!
Still nothing.

I thought you said you
knew what you were doing.

Do you wanna give it a try?

Well maybe we'd be
better off if I did.

[Simon] Well I think you
have a loose connection.

What?

Here, hold this for me please?

I think you have a
loose connection

between the battery
and the starter.

Now one sec.

Here, try now?

(engine revs and turns)

(man chuckles)

Nice!
Awesome! (chuckles)

We'd probably been
stuck here all week

if it weren't for you.

Oh. (laughs sarcastically)

My dad was a mechanic,

so he used to bring me
in all the time.

Cool.

Well, uh,

well where you headed?

Uh.

We're going down in
the 10th village

if you need a lift maybe?

Yeah.
Yeah, that would be awesome.

Thank you.

Cool.

Well, I'm Andrew.

And that's Jessie.

Simon.

Nice to meet you.

You too.

(serene and joyous music)

(Andrew yells excitedly)

(tool clicks)

Thank you guys for the food.

Sure, it's no problem.

You fixed our car, it's
the least we can do.

Did you lock the car?

Yeah.

So Simon,

you out here just all alone?

Yeah, it looks that way.

Well, more power to you.

Sometimes I wish I
could travel alone.

(Andrew chuckles)

You wouldn't last one
week without me.

Probably not.

So where you headed?

Oh, well I was trying
to get to Blackstone.

Whoa, uh.
Yeah.

That's a hike, son.

Yeah.

Do you guys know the best
way to get there from here?

Is it near Richmond?

Um, yeah.

Yeah, I think it is.

Okay, um,

head southeast,

probably follow 522.

See? Jessie's good at maps.

That's basically why I
keep her around.

Sure.

It was nice meeting you, Simon.

'Night, princess!

What a catch. (laughs)

You guys seem happy together.

(Andrew chuckles)

No, um, it's not like that.

She's like
practically my sister.

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

Sorry.

It's okay.

Where you guys headed?

[Man] Andrew!

Issac!

Hey man! Holy shit!

Hey, we didn't think we'd
see you until tomorrow!

Eh, well,

you know I wanted to
run for a long time so,

you know, made the trip
a lot faster.

Nice.

Yeah.

Who's this?

He is cute.

(Andrew laughs)

Oh, uh, wait. Hi.

Stay right there.

What?

Right (camera shutter
clicks) there.

Oh wait a minute, are you two?

No! No, no.

Look, we just picked him
up on the side of the road.

Simon, this is Issac.

He's an old friend.

His dad is gonna get
us work in his company

and we really appreciate that.

Well, I'm gonna get
some sleep so.

[Andrew] Yeah. Yeah.

It's nice meeting you Issac.

Dude, what the fuck is
wrong with you?

You need any help?

That's okay.

I'm just gonna get some sleep.

Oh, okay.

Good luck with everything.

Thank you. You too.

[Andrew] Dude, you
gotta let this go.

Please, it's not--

[Issac] I know you, Andrew.

I know what you're doing.

I'm not doing anything,

You can't--
I just met the kid.

I don't wanna hear it, man.

You know what?

I'm done. Fuck you.

Issac.
No, I'm done.

Issac!

(still but calm music)

Hey man, I'm sorry about Issac.

It's fine.

Where you sleeping tonight?

I don't know, I
don't have a tent.

Come on, you can
sleep in our tent.

Okay.

Dude, I swear to God.

If it wasn't for him taking
us to that coal mine,

I wish I would never
see him again.

Coal mine?

Yeah, we're supposed to
go there to work with him.

He's a good guy really

when he's not being
such a fucking asshole.

Jessie. Jessie.

Hey, hey, Simon's gonna
sleep in the tent tonight,

if that's okay.

Yeah, that's fine.

Where's Issac?

I don't know.
He's off somewhere.

He'll be fine.

(men shout in the distance)

(low, suspenseful music)
(woman screams)

(group makes a ruckus)

Guys!

Wake up!

There's some people
robbing the tents,

I think they have guns.
What?

[Andrew] Get your bag.

(guns fire haphazardly)

No!

[Simon] Just run!
Grab your stuff!

Where you think you're going?

(moves into intense and
suspenseful music)

(still and foreboding music)

[Jessie] Does Issac
know to meet us here?

How would he know to do that?

Sorry, just asking.

We'll meet him back
at camp in half a hour.

They should be gone by then.

What are you doing.

I think I'm gonna
head back with you guys.

I think I left some
stuff back at the camp.

Sure.

It doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

Yes it does.

He wouldn't have
left without it.

You okay?

Were you guys close?

Issac and Andrew--

He was my boyfriend.

Can we still get to the mine?

No.

What if we head back
up towards Pennsylvania?

Why?

What's gonna be up there now

that wasn't there before?

I have a place we can go.

What?

My uncle,

he owns a farms and
other families go there.

We could go together.

Why would you do that?

What do you mean?

You barely know us.

Honestly,

you guys know a lot
better than I do

about how to survive
out here and

I wouldn't mind traveling
with someone else.

It's near Blackstone?

That's almost 200
miles from here.

(calm and serene music)

Yeah, let's do it.

Based on what I've heard,

I don't think there's
gonna be anything better

anywhere closer to here.

We should scour the
area for food.

Did you guys find anything?

Not really.

Fine. Let's go.

Hey!

Why isn't anybody stopping?

[Andrew] Probably
because they think

we're going to rob them.

[Jessie] Come on.

(calm and serene music)

Come on.

We can get a little
further before dark.

I can take watch for the
first part of the night.

[Andrew] Alright.

I can take one too if
you guys need it.

Aww. No, that's okay Simon.

No, we got it.

Thanks though.

(moves into serene but
somber music)

Morning, sunshine.

Breakfast?

Once we start walking.

You just suck on it?

Yeah.

Doesn't do much to stave
off hunger but

keeps the saliva flowing.

Okay.

(men grunt and struggle)

Just keep your eyes down.

Keep walking.

(men grunt and pant)

(ponytailed man catcalls)

Hey baby!

You sure you don't
wanna come play with me?

Oh, no?
Think you're too good for me?

Yeah? Well fuck you, bitch!

What's your problem, dude?

(still and suspenseful music)

Simon, don't worry about it.

No. No, no, no.

Let the man speak for himself.

He's got a problem with me,

I'd love to hear it.

You shouldn't talk to
people like that.

(ponytailed man chuckles)

Oh you're a gentleman,
ain't you?

Just let him alone.

Yeah, and I said let
him speak for himself.

(moves into low and
bassy, suspenseful music)

You guys look like shit.

You see these cans?

They're mine.

You beat me in a fight,

they're yours.

So what do you say,

gentlemen?

Simon, you don't
have to do this.

(fat man chuckles)

[Fat Man] Ooh! (chuckles)

(coughs) Okay?

Alright man!

What's that?

Oh! Woo!

Eyes tearing up a little bit?

That what it is? Come on.

(Simon grunts in pain)

Ooh, now you can't
breathe can you?

Why's your head down?

You upset?

What about you, sweetheart?

Isn't this supposed
to be your man?

Your knight in
shining-- (grunts)

Come on.

Come on, baby. Come on!


Good fight, kid!

Let's go.

(Simon pants)

For what it's worth,

you almost look like a badass.

Thank you.

Almost.

(calm and serene music)

You look like shit, you know?

(Simon chuckles softly)

Does that hurt?

No.

Oh really?

Yeah, it's fine.

Admitting you're in pain

won't make me think you're
any less of a badass.

How's that?

Well,

you already proved otherwise
by getting your ass kicked.

(Simon chuckles softly)

Hey, I think I
lasted pretty well,

all things considered, so.

Sure!
Keep telling yourself that.

Some people would say it
was pretty cool

how I just volunteered and all.

Then let me help you.

Fine.

You know,

you can go to sleep,

I don't mind being lookout.

That's okay.

(moves into calm but
distorted and worrying music)

Psst, hey.

Can I talk to you?

(Andrew gags softly)

(Andrew grunts softly)

(serene but somber music)

(Andrew and Jessie mumble)

We were just looking
for some more plants.

Nothing but poisonous mushrooms.

How you holding up?

I'll be okay.

Alright.

Well just let me know if
you need a break.

(moves into soft and
serene piano music)

(sighs) I gotta sit down.

Yeah, me too.

How much further?

I don't know.

I just know we're going
in the right direction.

(Andrew laughs)

We're fucked.

We're gonna die out here.

We're not gonna die.

We barely even know
where we're going.

Okay.
Listen, I know it's south.

Okay, so once we hit Virginia,

I should be able to identify it.

We shouldn't even be out here.

We shouldn't be
following some kid.

Come on.

Fuck it.

Yeah, let's do it.

(soft and still music)

(Andrew chuckles happily)

(moves into calm and
mellow music)

(group splash around)

(group laugh softly)

[Andrew] No you don't! Oh no!

(Jessie giggles)

You're next, buddy!

(Andrew growls playfully)

(happy ragtime music)
(cartoon monkey laughs)

[Cartoon Monkey]
We'll find you.

(cartoon monkey laughs)

(cartoon monkey laughs happily)

How come cartoons
are so morbid?

It's not that morbid.

Like every scene
in this thing,

the character's about to
get dismembered or murdered

or something crazy.

It'll all end happy though.

(Jessie laughs softly)

Well yeah, but that's
not the point.

You are getting way too
profound for me, sister.

Yeah but

when did you think we realize

that this is just bullshit?

What do you mean?

Well there's gotta
be some point

where we just stop believing
in this stuff, right?

Just part of growing up,
I guess.

Yeah, I guess so.

Why did you leave?

Well there was just
nothing for me, is all.

Why'd you leave?

I screwed everything up.

I was raised by a foster dad,

he was a really good guy.

But I ruined it.

Is he still alive?

Yeah, but I can't
go back there.

Well you still have
Andrew though, right?

(Jessie chuckles)

I don't know,

I think he could probably
find himself another pet.

You're not a pet,
Andrew cares about you.

I care about you too.

Well that doesn't
count, you barely know me.

I know you enough.

Thank you.

It means a lot.

(giggles) What are you doing?

What? I.

Simon, you're a kid.
How old are you?

I'm 16! How am I a kid?

I've been running my family
business since I was 12.

You're young, you got
a lot left to learn.

Right.

Simon.

(sliding door squeaks open)

(calm and gentle music)

(car doors click
open and closed)

(calm but suspenseful music)

Hey!

The hell are you doing up there?

(door knob and keys
jingle intensely)

(sliding door squeaks open)

Jessie!

Jessie, wake up.

Jessie! Jessie!

The owners are back!

Did they see you?

I guess!
I was looking outside!

You what?

What's going on?

[Simon] The owners are back.

What?

Where are they?

Did they see you?

Andrew, let's go dude!

(shotgun cocks loudly)

Alright, let's see
those hands!

(shotgun fires)

Where's Andrew?

[Jessie] Andrew!

Talk to me.

(Andrew mumbles)

You'll be fine.

[Andrew] You idiot!

[Jessie] Don't blame him.

(pants) Why not?

You think they wouldn't see
you fell asleep on the porch?

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

Relax.

Let me look at your leg.

(Andrew screams)

I could've got us
some more food

if it wasn't for you!

Yelling at Simon
isn't gonna help.

Simon, grab his arm.

We need to take him to
the hospital.

We don't need him!

Andrew, calm down.

We need him

and he needs us.
No we don't.

We have the address.

We know where the farm is.

You think they're gonna
turn down free work?

Andrew, please don't
talk like that.

Why not, Simon?

Jessie, listen. Listen.

You know that he is a liability.

We don't even need him.

We don't even know if his
farm even fucking exist!

You're not being rational.

Maybe not.

But I rather risk
dying out there

than guaranteeing it with him.

You can come with me
if you want.

Your choice.

Jessie please don't leave
me out here by myself.

I'm sorry.

(Simon pants panicky)

(calm and relaxing music)

(wind howls and echoes)

(metal squeaks)

Uh, hi.

I'm sorry. I'm trying
to get to Blackstone.

Blackstone?

Yeah, I'm trying to get to,
uh--

Oh there's no place
called Blackstone.

I think it's near Dresden?

Dresden, is that near
the fish market?

Um, I'm really not sure.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here's what you do.

You got down that way
about a half a mile,

turn right on Riverside,
and you can't miss it.

Awesome.

Thank you very much, I
really appreciate it.

Guess I can't sell
you anything,

you look like shit.

Thank you.

That's not a complement.

(calm and serene music)

(moves into calm but
somber music)

Roberto?

[Man] Hey!

(moves into calm but
suspenseful music)

Who are you?

Roberto?

It's Simon.

Simon!

It's so good to see you.

I had no idea you were coming.

I didn't know how
to reach you.

How'd you get here?

Did you come here all alone?

Uh, no.
I came with two others.

Well where are they?

Uh, we split up a
little ways back.

I'm sorry to hear that.

But they're really
gonna miss out

on what I'm about to show you.

Come on.

We have a number of fields

with a variety of crops
growing this year.

Wow, that's awesome.

So, you did all this?

With a little bit of help.

We actually have three families

and a couple of individuals
who work here everyday.

Matter of fact,

a couple of young people
just showed up this morning.

And if you're willing to work,

this can be your home, Simon.

And this is our meeting room.

We come together as a
community once--

Oh, sorry for barging in.

This is my nephew, Simon.

He'll be staying with you
guys upstairs.

It's nice to meet you, Simon.

Nice to meet you too.

Well hey,

there's some toiletries
down the hallway

and some clothes you can
grab for yourself as well.

And there's some
showers out back,

get you cleaned up.

Yeah, I need one.

Yeah you do. (chuckles softly)

You look hungry, look.

Dinner'll be ready downstairs
in just a few minutes,

and I'll see you guys
in a little bit, okay?

Alright.

This is so good.

It's fresh from the farm.

It's incredible.

So you guys are ready
to work tomorrow?

Andrew?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Good.

I only ask you're ready to work

and do your fair share.

Understood?

Good.

Meet me out back of the
field at six.

I'll give you your jobs.

You're leaving?

Well we start pretty early

and I'm getting old.

You know, life here is better
than you can possibly imagine.

Where are you going?

Hey, Roberto.

Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

Sure. What's going on?

I did some not so
great things to get here,

some things I probably
wouldn't have done otherwise.

That's okay.

Well, don't you want
me to tell you about it?

No.

What matters now is you're here.

Well, I just don't
wanna be a bad person.

Simon.

I've known you since
you were a little boy.

You're a good person.

My mom told me she didn't
want me to turn out like you but

why would she say
something like that?

Your mom, she, uh,

she, uh, never
really forgave me.

Well how's that fair?

Simon, you can't
change people's feelings.

I did what I did,

and sometimes I regret it.

And sometimes it keeps
me up at night.

But I can't change past.

What happened?

Years ago when things
started taking their turn,

I was seeing this young woman.

Turns out she gets pregnant.

And I tried to tell her that
I would take care of her,

but she wasn't having
any part of that.

She said I could never
be a provider so she left

and took my child.

I'm sorry.

My mom didn't know?

She never knew she
even existed.

Anyway,

I could stay there anymore.

I felt so alone.

So I left and I came here.

I had no idea what I was doing,

I thought I was gonna
die in my field.

But I didn't.

I just kept working

and then crops started to grow

and people started to come.

I made it my mission that

no one would ever go hungry.

Simon, I never meant to
abandon you and your mother.

But I can't look back.

What good would that do?

No, I don't think
you did anything wrong.

Let me show you something.

What is it?

It's a lotus flower.

I remember reading years ago

about some Chinese scholar.

He used to say that I
love the lotus flower

because it grows in mud

but it always emerges beautiful.

What do you think he
meant by that?

Not really sure,

but it reminds me that it
doesn't matter

where you come from.

It only matters where you
are and where you're going.

You can't change the past,
Simon.

Look Simon.

I can't let myself get
stained by the mud,

and neither can you.

This place is gonna break you.

What?

Your mind, man.
You don't understand.

Most newbies don't make
it through the first week.

Roberto boots their asses.

Naw, Roberto wouldn't
do that to me,

I'm his family.

He'll replace anybody
in a heartbeat,

even family.

No one gives a shit about you.

That's not how it works here.

Well,

thanks for the heads up.

Always looking out
for newbies.

(calm but sharp music)

Hey guys!

(moves into calm and
relaxing music)

Good morning.

Ready to get started?

Good. Let's go.

Well, your job this time
of year is pretty simple.

Pick fruit and vegetables,

do the weeding, and
water the crops.

Any questions?

Nope.

Alright well, I'ma get going.

Dinner's at my house tonight,
okay?

Thanks Roberto.

For everything.

Anytime Simon.

How you know Roberto?

His farming.

Oh. Great.

I'm gonna have you work
on the outskirts here

digging the new fields.

Dig up the top 12
inches of soil.

Keep going until this
whole area's done.

Here's your shovel.

How long is this
supposed to take me?

Listen,

you're gonna go until
the sun starts to set.

And you're gonna bring
the shovel back.

When the sun rise tomorrow,

you're gonna come back
and do it again.

And the next day, again
and again and again.

And once this area is done,

you start another.

I can give you some advice,
if you want.

No, I'm cool.

Look, if we're gonna be
here together,

we may as well be on
speaking terms,

you know?

I'm sorry about the way
things turned out.

No, we all got here, right?

I was just really freaked
out about everything, you know?

Yeah.

Alright, I'll leave you to it.

You feel alright?

Yeah.

Yeah, just some blisters.

How was your day?

[Jessie] Pretty good.

Got to pick
vegetables with Simon.

Ah, I see.

So you guys are working
together, huh?

Yeah.

Who's in charge?

Excuse me?

Who are you and what are
you doing on my land?

Joseph. Hi.

I just need food for me
and my children.

I was wondering if you could--

You expect me to
give you my food?

I would appreciate it if
you could spare something.

Can you work?

Not like I used to,

but I noticed that you got
a fine garden out there,

I can help.

We need people to work
in the fields.

I can't stand for
long, it hurts my knees.

But I can help you sow
those vegetables.

I'm sorry.
I don't need you here.

Just let him help, Robert.

Simon!

Let me handle this.

He's gonna die out there!

Please, just let me help.

I said I don't need you here.

It's time for you to go.

I'm tired.
Could we just stay the night?

If I were you, I'd
leave right now.

You see that guy who came in?

Yeah, what about him?

I don't know.

I think what Roberto did
was kinda wrong.

You kidding?

I would've done the same thing.

He's just some lowlife
looking for a handout.

He can't help anyone here.

Hey, he's still a
person though.

Man, if that type of
shit bothers you,

then you really don't
belong here.

Pricks like that show
up all the time.

Want us to give them our stuff.

He's not a prick!
The guy was crippled!

I'd shoot him if they let me.

Might have to pretty soon
if that jerk comes back.

Hey Simon.

Hey.

I gotta talk to you for
a minute, man.

Look, I know you're not very
happy with me right now,

but I need to ask you a favor.

Yeah, what's that?

(sighs) I need you to not
tell people about my leg.

It's gotten a lot worse

and if they find out,
they're gonna kick me out.

I don't know what to say.

Look man,

I did what I had to do.

Alright?
You would've done

the same thing.

I wouldn't have just
left my friend

in the middle of nowhere.

Friend?

We only knew each
other a few days.

When we first met Issac, you
told me you were using him.

That's not what I meant!

Yeah, but that's how you've
always seen me, isn't it?

Sure. Okay when we
first got together, maybe.

But then something happened,
alright?

Maybe we became friends,

maybe I'm just a fucking idiot,

but you do what you gotta
do to survive.

Don't worry, I
won't tell anyone.

Thanks man.

Hey.

I just wanted to thank you.

For what?
I didn't do anything.

You did what you could.

I was wondering if I
could get some of those?

I can't just give you
these, I'd get in trouble.

Oh come on kid.

Well you know what it's
like out here.

We all gotta work together,
right?

(still and concerning music)

Thank you.

Yeah they sell these in town,
they're just so expensive.

What do you think
you're doing?

He's hungry and we
have more than enough.

You thought you could
just come back here?

Just take whatever you wanted?

(pants) I'm sorry.

You didn't earn these.

I'm sorry.

I said I would work for them,
please.

Please, please.

I hope for your sake

I never see you here again.

Get out!

You can't do that to people!

Stay out of it Simon!

What happened to you?

You broke the rules.

No dinner tonight or
breakfast in the morning.

Now get back to work!

Do you wanna make it four meals?

No sir.

(Andrew grunts and pants)

(Andrew grunts in pain)

(still and calm music)

We got you something.

I know it's not much but

I thought you could use it.

Where'd you get this?

We snuck it out of
the dining hall.

Yeah.

Wasn't that hard really.

It's not like they have armed
guards at all the exits.

Thank you.

I know we don't deserve it but

I hope you can not hate us.

Well, I did get you shot.

You didn't get me shot.

We can make it work here,
I know it.

Anyway, good night guys.

(Andrew grunts in discomfort)

There's something wrong
with this place.

You and Jessie need to get
out as soon as you can.

(moves into calm but
concerning music)

Why wouldn't you come with us?

I can't get
anywhere on this leg.

Simon, listen to me.

I love her.

I want her to go with
somebody that I can trust.

Thank you for the food.

You're welcome.

Now get some rest.

(Simon sighs)

Where's Thomas?

I don't know.

Roberto called him over
to the southern fields

a few minutes ago.

(still and calm music)

Simon? What are you doing?

Roberto, what are you doing?

When your friend arrived,

he failed to mention
his infected leg.

He's neglected his
injuries to the point

that soon he won't be
able to contribute.

So what, you're not
gonna help him?

We don't have the resources.

This community is built
upon able bodies.

It only works when
people contribute.

I can't keep somebody that
doesn't have a purpose.

Just can't allow it.

So you're just
gonna let him die?

Do you have any idea

how many people are
dying out there?

It's not my job to help them!

It's my job to protect
the life that we built.

Our survival.

I'm not about to sabotage
this community

with the life of some
worthless freeloader.

[Jessie] Andrew!

Simon!

Get back to your field
and get to work.

No.

Don't be ridiculous.

For the first time in months,

you have a home, food,

people that care about you,
purpose.

You can't just throw
that all away!

Simon look. I love you.

Okay? We're family.

We gotta stick together.

I'm all you got!

Simon!

Simon.

I'm sorry.

For what?

None of this would've
happened if it wasn't for me.

You know, I didn't think things
would turn out like this.

We never should have
abandoned you.

You're a good kid.

You and Andrew are all I have.

What're we gonna do?

I don't know.

(calm but foreboding
and somber music)

(Andrew grunts weakly)

(moves into calm and
peaceful music)

(people mumble in the distance)

(peaceful yet somber music)
