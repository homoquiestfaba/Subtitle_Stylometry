"'who is like unto me" said

The cub, 'but thee?' Pride of

His earliest kill.

The jungle is large, and the

Cubby is small.

"Let him think and be still."

Do you hunt, Mr. Miller?

No.

Well, you ought to.

That quote was baloo teaching

Mowgli the law of the jungle.

Thank you for meeting,

Mr. Carson.

It was a pleasant surprise.

I wanted to meet the young

Man who, uh, took these

Pictures.

I'm very, uh, keen on emerging

Artists.

Collecting art is a...

Hobby of mine.

Well, I take it very

Seriously.

I'm glad you like them.

I do, but they confirm my

Suspicions.

There's a fire sale happening.

A going-out-of-business sale for

The baby-boom generation.

You know, I-i don't quite know

How we fucked up.

Maybe it was when we started

Giving you ribbons for

Participation or drugging you

Up at the least sign of

Discontent.

All you're qualified for is to

Live at home, keep a blog...

And persuade the rest of your

Entitled friends that your

Whimsical social commentaries

Are interesting.

These pictures don't...

Represent the rise of a new

Generation.

To me, you see, they perfectly

Capture its decline!

Recent data from the

Census bureau says that the

Income of the U.S. middle class

Is on the rise, although

Pollsters are telling the

Presidential candidates they

Could still use some help.

Senator mccain talked about an

Economic plan that would

Restore bottom-up economic

Growth, and senator Obama

Talked about economic growth

Designed from the ground up.

Thanks again.

It was his time.

Thank you.

Thanks.

I'll see you back at the house.

Thanks for coming, taking

Your time out of the office.

We'll see each other at the

House.

I'll see you back there,

Okay?

Thanks so much.

Take care.

You know, we'll... we'll come

As much as we can, you know,

We'll make a great donation, and

We'll support the temple as much

As we can.

So sorry.

You know, I'm a busy guy.

Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you for coming.

Every, um, new beginning.

Some time now.

Yeah, I guess so.


This is Kate's cousin, ira's

Kid, fisher.

This is Mr. and Mrs. Goodman.

Oh, right, yeah.

Sorry about your gramps.


You all right?

Mm-hmm.

See you in the limo.

I thought the rabbi did a great

Job.

The service was beautiful.

Where was Kate at the

Funeral?

She was with her friends.

You'll see her back at the

House.

I was wondering if I could

Maybe stay with you two a little

Longer after ira leaves.


You know, I'm actually thinking

About transferring to a school

In the city, so it'd be really

Good to be close by.

Hmm?

I think Kate would enjoy

That.

Huh.

Huh.


You call your father "ira"?


Stay as long as you want,

Fisher.

You will have a lot more fun at

Our place than you will at that

Miserable ithaca.


Thank you, yeah.

How is your mom and your

Little brother?

She must be [Inhales deeply]

Well, she must be much happier

Nowadays.

You don't have to tip-toe

Around him.

Renee and I are still best

Friends.


Do me a favor, ira.

Let's not make this your

Coming-out party.

We all know you're gay.


Guess we should talk about

Dad's will.

Take a year to get the audit

Done on the estate.

Great, let's go from one

Awkward conversation to the

Next.

Hey!

You watch yourself, smartass!

Your grandfather's gonna finance

An entire education you want!

[Birds chirping]

Hey, honey.

Hi.

How are you?

I'm good. Thanks.

Um, dad?

Hmm?

Can you return these for me

In the city?

No, because I have a job.

I go to an office, and I do

Something every day.

I need a dress for Dylan's

Party.

Okay, you will return them or

Give them to goodwill.

Mom...

I need a photographer for my

Modeling book.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Mary!

I'm sorry.

Spill!


Maybe fisher could take your

Head shots.

You know, he's really good.

Listen, I'm... this is my

Fault.

I-I can take care of it.

He can take care of it, Mary.

It's all right, fisher.

Really, let me take care of

It.

Mary, the shake... can you

Split it for Kate and I?

Yes.

Can you hand me the plate?

Thank you.

Sure.

Mary, it's okay.

I don't want it.

No, bring the shake, Mary.

Hey, hollow out that bagel and

Go ligh on the cream cheese.

Relax.

And, Katherine, w-what'd we

Say about these machines on the

Table?

Now, we're a family.

We don't have the berries and

The iPods and the tweeters and

The...

Dad, you're not funny by

Saying "Berry," okay?

And it's iPhone, and it's not a

Machine.

Take the phone off the table!

Phil.

Can we all just relax?

[Birds chirping]


Take it down.

Let's get going.

You're gonna help me go through

Grandpa's stuff.

Um, I was thinking about

Going into the city with Phil

Today.

There's a, um, Professor there

That I'd really like to meet.

I thought you of all people

Would want to go through his

Things.

I'm...

Well, we all grieve

Differently, ira, okay?

Your son's a go-getter, wants to

Make something of himself.

This kid's got a future.

He is a real Miller.

Okay.

Just don't forget to see what

Type of campus jobs are

Available, fisher.

I'd hate for you to have to beg

Phil for money.

What the hell is that

Supposed to mean?

Hey, listen, I-i apologize

For what I said to your dad, and

I don't want you to hear that

Stuff.

You know, I-i adore your father,

But sometimes he goes off at the

Mouth.

He doesn't know what he's

Talking about.

I understand.

It's a sibling thing.

Before I forget, spend a

Little time with your cousin,

Okay?

You're staying at the house.

Maybe earn your keep a little

Bit.

I don't think she wants me

Around.

Katherine doesn't know what

The fuck she wants, okay?

My daughter likes to walk around

Malls a-and buy shoes.

Yeah, hi.

Yes, I was on the subway.

What's allianz at?

Buy it at 19, 20, whatever,

Okay?

And, uh, g.E.?

It's a piece of shit.

Legg Mason? Short it.

Good, good.

And vanguard... just short the

Shit out of it, okay?

I want to make some money.

Because I'm in the fucking

Business of making money.

That's why.

God damn it.

Jesus Christ.

Come on, fisher, let's go.

Hey, Phil!

Hey, Rafael!

How you doing, you son of a

Bitch?!

How'd you get away with that?!

He's an asshole.


Listen, I've been thinking

About this, art school, LA, LA,

LA, but what you really want to

Do... you want to go to business

School.

It's the smart thing.

Grandpa thought I should

Pursue photography.


Grandpa didn't know what the

Fuck he was talking about, okay?

And he was a numbers guy.

You have some very powerful

Images in here.

Much stronger than the portfolio

You e-mailed.

Thank you.

So, uh, listen, I have to ask

You.

Do you think I have a shot?

I wish I could say it's not

Up to me or my department.

Yeah, what I mean is, um...

You think you could put in a

Good word for me with

Admissions?

Keep shooting.

My classes will be every

Thursday afternoon at 3:00 this

Fall semester.

You can audit the class, and

I'll look at your work.

[Birds chirping]

I have to hit the road.

Here.

It was grandpa's.


[Chirping continues]

Here.


Look, your mom and I are gonna

Be fine.

And so are you.

Yeah. Thanks.

And don't worry about Phil

And me fighting.

It won't have any affect on your

Staying here.

They love you.

Just go easy on the sarcasm,

Okay?

[Chuckles softly]

Yeah.

[Chirping continues]

Drive safe, okay?

Mm-hmm.

[Chirping continues]

[Engine turns over]

You should've never dumped

Dylan.

You googled his stepfather?

Yeah.

He's loaded.

His mom scored.

I heard he's, like, this

British billionaire.

[Chuckles softly]


What are you wearing tonight?

I don't know.

It's a white party, right?

Um...

Wear something white?

But I think you can cheat it

A little bit.

I mean... who's that guy?

That's my cousin.

From new Hampshire.

He's really annoying.

What's up?

Hello.

This is Jody.

You're from new Hampshire?

No, I'm from ithaca.

He's from ithaca.


Is it cool if I smoke weed

Back here?

You're smoking already.


You know, Kate, I can take those

Head shots for you if you want.

No.

Dude, pass that Marley.

You are such a pothead.

Mm-hmm.

My friend's brother grows it.

Thanks.

So I got a nice supply.

What? It's just pot.

So, there's no sun in ithaca?

[Both laugh]


Fisher, this is my boyfriend,

Todd.

Hey, man.

So, I hear you're trying to get

Into my school.

Yeah, I am.

You should come here.

You're kind of stoned, Jody.

Hell, I'd suck his dick if he

Could get me more of this weed.

Ew!


It's, um, $60 an 1/8.

Deal.

So, you coming with us tonight?

No.

Where am I not going?


You can be my plus one.

Yeah.


No, you have nothing to wear.

No.

Well, why don't you just take

Him shopping?

Todd.

Cousin's about to make a lot

Of money.

Todd.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Nice.

Champagne?

Absolutely.

Where is everybody?

Party's out back.

Follow the music.

[Cheering in distance]

Sooner we get fucked, the

Better.

Where's Matt?

Champagne?

Thanks.

[Mid-tempo music playing]

[Indistinct talking]

Do you have any words for the

Host?


Awesome party, Dylan.

This party sucks, babe.

Cut. Cut.

Why would you say that?


No, stop!


Come on.

[Both laughing]

[Piano music playing]

[Inhales deeply]

Want to go home with me?

Come on, what are you doing?


I want to go home.

Sorry, d-didn't see you guys.

[Piano music continues]

Yo, what up, long island?

Make some noise tonight in here!

We're having fun!

[Up-tempo music playing]

My man Dylan paid a lot to have

Me here tonight.

Well, make some noise for the

Host with the most, my man Dylan

Himself!

[Cheers and applause]

Thank you, thank you, thank

You.

It was worth every single penny

To have you here tonight, man.

Give it up for Dylan and his

Mom, ladies and gentlemen!

[Cheers and applause]

Whoo!

[Up-tempo music continues]

Show me what you got, ithaca.

Mnh-mnh.

No, no, I'm not a dancer.


Did you bring me pot?

Did I bring you what?

Pot!

No.

Come on.

Oh!

This is such a waste!

I mean, whoever threw this

Party has no taste.

You're funny, Dylan.

Dylan Carson.

Oh.

I'm... I'm sorry.

I-I-i didn't...

I...

Sorry.

To think that you two share

The same gene pool.

[Up-tempo music continues]

How do you know that we're

Related?

Dylan. Dylan.

There's some important people I

Want you to meet.

Tuck your shirt in.

Yes, mother.

[Up-tempo music continues]

Thank you.

Hey!

Yo!

What's going on, man?

You have amazing shit!

Thank you.

Taste it.

[Cheers and applause]

Whoo!

[Up-tempo music continues]

[Cheers and applause]

[Up-tempo music continues]

Hey!


Okay, now.

I'm sorry.

Just trying to get us out of

This.

Well, that was awesome, man.

Oh, my God, the music was so

Good.

You shouldn't be wearing

Those heels, babe.


Should we draw on her face?

No.

[Snoring continues]

She has a summer job in the

Morning... how annoying.

[Snoring continues]

She has a perfect body.

Ew!

You're such a perv.

I-I'm not a perv.

[Chuckles softly]

I'm a beauty enthusiast.

And a drug dealer.


Ah, that's why I'm not in school

This semester.


But somehow, my dad managed

To keep me from getting

Expelled.



M-my heart's beating really

Fast.

In a good way?

No.



I think I'm having a heart

Attack.


No, it's not funny.

Don't laugh at me.


I'm not laughing at you.

You're just bugging out a little

Bit.

You're fine.

Hey...

Relax.

Lay down, breathe.

You'll be good in like 10

Minutes.

I never smoked pot before.

Seriously?

Wow.

I'm having a reaction.

You're okay.

Just breathe.


Don't act so cool.

I remember you were a geek.

[Chuckles softly]

Yeah, I remember.

And you used to have grandpa's

Magnifying glass.

And you used to call yourself...

Both: Sherlock Holmes.

Yeah. [Chuckles softly]

I remember.

You know, my therapist said that

Was a defense mechanism.

All the clues and trying to

Figure stuff out.

'Cause my parents are so messed

Up.


[Both laugh]

[Birds chirping]

[Snoring softly]

[Chirping continues]

Sorry to hear about your

Grandfather.

Thanks, man.

Am I sitting in your spot or

Something?


It's a public park.

That's not the point.

So?

The point is, why did you

Think my party was such a waste?

I, uh...

I don't know.

I just... I've never really been

To a party like that before.

Resentment is not superior to

Earning money.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

You're interesting.

I want to take you somewhere.

Not now.

Right now.

Um, i... I'm sorry.

Are you trying to invite me

Somewhere?

Is that what that is?

This is fantastic.

Hey, I got something for you.


Thanks.

[Door closes]

Mind if I take a picture of you?

Yeah, sure.

So, tell me about your

Cousin.

Do you think Todd makes her

Happy?


I don't think Kate has a lot to

Complain about.

Girls like Kate, they always

Want something better.


Guy like you could have any girl

He wants.

No, I'm talking about Kate.

Fisher, help me win her heart.

I'm not ask you to sell me weed.

S... what? How do you...

I also know that you want to

Get transferred to a certain

School out here.

My stepfather happens to be a

Trustee.

I can get you an interview there

If you want.

I'm not gonna be here for

Very long, so, I-i...

I can change that.

But I need your help.

Look, I-i think we should

Probably head back to shore.

Yeah.


[Engine turns over]

[Engine revving]

[Birds chirping]

[Indistinct talking]

[Chirping continues]

Another round for team

Kazanoff.

Watch your game, flinches.

Dad, stop.

Seriously, come on.

Let's go check out this

Property in sands point I think

You can flip.

Then if your son's lucky, he'll

Cruise town in my new Aston for

Young tail.

Matt.

Maybe grab beluga steak.

Must be annoying not to have

A place to let it rip, Jack.

You think I worry about a

Speeding ticket at this point in

My life?

Is this the guy?

Yeah.

Listen, school's starting,

And we need... we need a lot.

I can do that.

Hurry up, Matt, or we'll

Ditch you!


[Sniffs deeply]

I can work with that.

Bring him by the pad sometime,

Goodman.

All right.

You know who his dad is, right?

You want to.

He knows everyone in the city.

Just leave your bike.

[Indistinct talking]


Stop doing that.

Look what I got for you,

Baby.

Oh, oh.


How about that back table?

Um, that's reserved for

Dylan Carson.

For Carson?

Mm-hmm.

Me and fish were at his

Labor day event.

Why didn't you take me?

I had to take my boyfriend.

Todd, you know, for someone

Who's not gay, you sure say a

Lot of homoerotic things.


Shut up.

I like him.


Yeah, he's great.

Um, please.


You give Carson a table and

Put me here?

Sorry, Todd.

We'll make it up to you.

Stay for dessert.


Wow.

How's everything over here?

Dude, she fucks like you

Think a Latin chick would fuck.


But don't tell Kate, all right?

It's just between us.

Yeah.

Watch it, dick.


Hey, Jody.

Hey, ithaca.


So, do you think he'll show?


Fish, just say you like to get

Baked and make some quick cash.

Having something people want...

Best way to make friends.

I'm not a drug dealer,

Though.

I just like hooking people up.


[Up-tempo music playing]

Talking about hooking people

Up, have you thought about what

We discussed?

Yeah.

I'm cool with all of it, but you

Got to promise me something.

Okay.

You can't hurt her.

Of course.

[Birds chirping]

Hey. What's going on, guys?

Didn't know you two were

Friends.

Yeah, of course we're good

Friends.

Yeah, we're friends.


What are you doing here,

Dylan?

Uh, I came to see you.

Fisher here said he was

Preparing to shot you two

Beautiful ladies.

Can you help me with my

Camera stuff?

[Chirping continues]

Uh, um...

D-did you have a good time at my

Party?

Yeah.

Your house is beautiful.

You're beautiful.

Dylan.

The hell are you doing?

I'm not doing anything.

You, uh, you want to go

Inside?

Yeah.

Sure.

Need help?

I'm so blazed.


Your pot is so good.

Uh, what do you think he sees

In her?

I don't know.

They have history.

Hey, Kate...

Um...

Do you remember that, uh,

Thanksgiving when, um...

We were biking and I fell off

And you played nurse for like

Two hours?

[Both laugh]

Yes.

I've just been thinking about

That a lot.

Oh, I'm so excited for this

Photo shoot.

That looks pretty good.

Thanks.

You're insane.

I've kind of missed you.

I missed you, too.

Should we leave them

Downstairs for a while?

I'm really not sure who this

Guy is.

His mom married some

Investment-banker guy,

Andrew Carson.

Goes from Dylan nobody to

Dylan Carson.



This is exactly...



Oh! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

Hey, look at me. Come on.

I can't hear you.

Look at me, look at me.

Yeah.

[Camera shutter clicks]

Don't smile.

More intense.

Um, just play with the water a

Little.

Yeah, exactly.

Take in the fountain.

That's good. Enjoy it.

Just sit down on the bench.

Okay.

Just keep giving me that

Gold.

That gold.

Okay, it feels a little static.

Jody, you look beautiful.

Um...

Why don't you get in this?

All right.

Liven them up.

Okay, this looks a bit like a

Family portrait... a little

Awkward.

Come around, come around.

Sit in between them on the

Bench.

Put your sunglasses on.

Look out.

You're... you're king, right?

This is your house.

Fuck, you look so good.

Holy fuck.

He didn't live like that when we

Dated.

Dylan is so mysterious.

Yeah, he's a pretty eccentric

Kid.

So are you.

Shh! Fisher.

Gotcha!

No? [Laughs]

You ran in here. I heard you.

Shut up.

Are these from today?

Yeah.

Is that Carson's house?

You look bloated.


Asshole!

All right, I need your

Fashion advice.

My mom's a mess.

What do you think?

Turn.

Mm-hmm.

You look like your dad.

So do you, faggot.

Todd.

I'm kidding.

What do... unbuttoned or

Buttoned?

Uh, top unbuttoned.

Yeah?

Very handsome.

Would you buy a house from

Me?

Yes.

Really?

Yes.

Come on, flinches, we got a

Meeting!

Shit, that's my dad.

God, check that pimple.

Follow me.

Love you.


[Birds chirping]

So, my friends are very, very

Happy.

I want you to make it a full

Ounce next time.

Okay.

Hello, handsome.

Hey, bunny.

Hey, dad, can I drive?

I don't know. Can you?


Sure.

When you can afford an

Aston Martin...

You work your whole lifetime

For.

Hmm.

Yeah.

Come on, hop in.

Yeah.

See you, fisher.

See you.

Your mom called.

She's excited for her wedding.

You should call her back.

[Engine turns over, revs]

I hear you have grass.

Uh...

Relax.

Phil's not home.

Come on.

[Sniffs, coughing]


You ever go swimming in this

Pool?

[Birds chirping]

No. No one ever does.


You should try it.

It's really nice.

How long have you been

Smoking weed?

Um, oh, for a while.

Beginning or middle of high

School.

That's not a while, kid.


Do you ever wake and bake?

I used to love getting stoned in

The morning.

Yeah, occasionally.


Your parents know you smoke?

They know I smoke.

I know they smoke. [Chuckles]

We never talk about it, though.

I think my mom really likes

Smoking.

Mm.

My dad probably just got

Stoned so he could have sex with

A woman.



Oh.

Fisher, I'm sorry.

God.

I used to love getting stoned

With your mom.


Thought you two hated each

Other.

Oh, we do but not always.


We went to Cornell together.


We used to party.


Does Kate smoke pot?


Definitely not.

I don't think so. [Blows]

She's pretty involved with her

Boyfriends.



Oh, great!

Great.

What?

Funny, darling.

Did you see the credit-card bill

This month?

We need to talk about Mary's

Salary, and when you sober up...

Phil, let's not do this right

Now.


Must be nice...

Not having a job.

[Clears throat] I'm sorry.

What did you say?

Are we gonna have this

Conversation again?

Who made this house?

Who keeps this house nice for

You 365 days of the year?

You don't think that's work?

I'm sorry, fisher. I'm sorry.

That's okay.

It's that promise that's

Always set this country apart,

That through hard work and

Sacrifice, each of us can

Pursue our individual dreams

But still come together as one

American family to ensure...

Who cares?

That the next generation

Can pursue their dreams, as

Well.

That's why I stand here

Tonight...


Because for 232 years at

Each moment when that

Promise...

Give me Dylan Carson.


Students and soldiers,

Farmers and teachers,

Nurses and janitors...

You're, uh, practically

Naked.


Does that make you

Uncomfortable?

We meet at one of those

Defining moments...

I wonder what Kate's doing

Now, do you think she's blown

Him yet?

Our economy is in

Turmoil...

She blew Todd on their first

Date.

That's my little cousin.

Tonight, more Americans...

Do you think that I should

Blow you yet?

More of you have lost your

Homes, and even more are

Watching your home values

Plummet.

More of you have cars you can't

Afford to drive, credit cards,

Bills you can't afford to pay,

And tuition that's beyond your

Reach.


Shit. Jesus fucking...


These challenges are not all

Of the government's making.

Oh, my God.

It's not fucking funny, all

Right?!

Just go jerk off on your

Cousin's bed, you fucking freak!

Shit.

Of the broken politics in

Washington...


[Door slams]

And the failed policies of

George w...

Can I just compliment you on

Your product?

It makes me go blind.

Yeah, it's really fresh.

It's, uh, from upstate New York,

Where I'm from.



Pack it up again.

We've got to get some pussy

Here.

I got a good stripper friend

We could call if you want.

Goodman!

You got a guest!

Is he all right?

Oh, yeah, he's good.

You sure?


Okay.

Now he will be... again.


Eh.

It's not bad.

Here, add to it.

No, I'm good.

Add to it.

I'm okay.

Add to it.

Okay.

Boys, here, man.

We're throwing a big bash

Here next week, fisher.


Bring more weed.



Pissed at you now!


[Bell chimes]

Camera's broken.

They can't fix it.

Well, tell me you didn't lose

My head shots.

No, I didn't lose your head

Shots.

They were able to retrieve the

Roll.


You're welcome, Kate.

I look amazing in these.

Yeah, you do, but you

Overshadow Jody.

We need to find fish a new

Bitch.

No, every stupid college girl

Is gonna want a piece of your

Cousin with something green to

Offer them.

Yeah, speaking of college,

You really need to set up that

Interview.

What's interview?

You don't need a college

Degree to make your first

Million, fisher.

Eh, you still got a leg up

With a college degree.

That is just your dad

Talking.

Excuse me, miss?

Yes, Mr. Carson?

Uh, come sit down here a

Second.

My, uh, my cousin here has

Something to say to you.

Uh, yeah, he has a present

For you, actually.

Don't you, fisher?

Uh, yeah, right.

How could I forget? [Chuckles]


Oh. [Chuckles]

I remember you.

Yeah.

Yeah, she, uh, she was really

Bummed that you didn't invite

Her to the, uh, labor day party.

Yeah, I hear you have a

Beautiful, beautiful home,

Mr. Carson.


Yeah, yeah, I do.

Guess whose birthday we're

Celebrating tonight?

Really? Ooh!

Feliz cumpleaÃ±os! [Smooch]

Yeah, thank you.



I actually speak a little

Spanish.

You do?

I don't think you do.

What my cute cousin here is

Trying to say is that he would

Love for you to be his special

Guest tonight back in

Kings point at our mansion.

Ah!

Now, that is what they call a

10-out-of-10 olympic dive.

4 out of 10?

4 out of 10.

Well, I want to get a 10.

10 out of 10.

Well, more like 100 out of

10.

That's better.

Basically.

[Cicadas chirping]


Is it, like...

Really your birthday?


Feels like my birthday.


[Cicadas chirping]


How does that feel, huh?



Stop looking!


[Speaking Spanish]

Muy, muy, muy, muy privilegiada.

I have no idea what that

Means.


It means...

You live a charmed life,

Fisher...

Carson.

[Chirping continues]

Wake up!

Fisher, wake up!

I left you some gifts on the

Table.

Meet me outside.

[Birds chirping in distance]

So, did you have fun last

Night?

Yeah.

[Birds chirping]

Oh, shit.

Wow.

All right, for that, get in

Goal.

Where?

Yeah, right there.

Trees.

That was awful.


[Chirping continues]

All right, fisher, you're

Going down.

Is that a joke?

Warm-up?

No, it's not a warming up.

Is that really the best you got?

All right, you ready, fisher?

Mm-hmm.


The ball sucks.


It's not funny.

You're bringing me down to your

Level.

You can see it's a French

Style.

Ah.

Really quite unique and

Beautiful.

The property has 18 perfectly

Manicured acres.

Yeah, 18 acres.

[Speaking foreign language]

Who let you in?!

I have the gate code.

[Speaking foreign language]

My dad's agency has the listing.

I'm showing Mr. and Mrs. abady

Around.

Hey, how are you?

I'd like to meet your dad.

Uh, if we like what we see, uh,

You tell him we make good deal.

We pay all in cash.

This house is not for sale.

Uh...

Like it or not, this house is

Going up for sale, Dylan, and

It's gonna do quick, so why

Don't you go back in the garden

And play with your boyfriend

While we look around?

There's lots of rumors going

About.

There's one in particular about

Your cokehead son, Navid.

[Speaks foreign language]

What is he talking about?

[Indistinct talking]

What they talking about?

Excuse me.

I-I would like to speak to your

Father right away... right away.

Abs... yes, absolutely.

I'm sorry. Yes.

Watch your mouth.

Be nice to the natives.

[Indistinct talking]

He's just a child.

Hey.

[Talking continues]

What's going on?

Is your family moving again?

I made love to Kate last

Night.

She loves me.

[Mid-tempo music playing]

So, you want to practice

Parallel parking here?


Not a fan.

Well, you need it to pass

Your test.

No, I'm not gonna spend the

Last day before school starts

Learning.

Check it.

I could work with that.


But we are not smoking in

Your dad's car.

[Music stops]

Okay, we'll smoke outside...

Doesn't matter.

All right.

[Door ajar beeps]

Details.

No.

Why?!

I set that shit up!

I deserve to know!

I don't kiss and tell.

You kissed her?

Yeah, you're very intuitive.

You're such an asshole.

You know that Todd was at,

Uh, Carson estate this morning,

Right?

No. Why?

You can relax.

He doesn't know anything.


Okay, well, why was he there?

He was showing Navid and his

Parents the estate.

Dylan's not moving.

He would've said something to

Me.

[Coughs, chuckles]

You're gonna laugh?

Not funny.

What?

I... look, Kate, I don't

Understand.

Why are you so concerned about

It?

You're with both of them.

Like, w-what difference does it

Make?

Well, Todd didn't call me

Last night.

He didn't text me this morning.

Oh, my God.

I'm checking my phone.

Okay.


Want me to try?


Like this?


[Laughing continues]

Eye on the ball.


Hold this drink. Excuse me.

Enough.

[Clears throat]

What are you up to, mister?

That's Todd's dad.

What are you up to?

Don't judge me, fisher.

I'm not judging you.

Really?

Really.

You know what?

News flash... fuck you.

I want you out of my house

Tomorrow.

You want me out of your

House?

Mm-hmm.

Are you kidding me?

Do I look like I'm kidding?

Okay.

I think Kate would probably

Really enjoy these pictures,

Don't you?

Give me that.

Get the fuck off of me!

Play with people your own

Age.

Yeah, fuck you, bunny.

Fuck you.

Kate, let's get out of here!

No, no, I-I'm driving.

You're not driving.

[Birds chirping]

[Car doors close]

Fisher.

My dad just fired Mary.

I've known her my whole life.

I know.

She used to work for grandma and

Grandpa.

I'm really sorry.

It's pretty fucked up.

[Zipper whirs]

Are you leaving?

Your parents have been so

Generous letting me stay here

For so long.

I, uh...

I'm not leaving town, though.

I'm just crashing at Dylan's.

Lucky you.


Lucky me.

Probably gonna have to get a

Part-time job soon.

Living in the city is gonna be

Very expensive.

Will you do this for me?

Uh-huh.

Can I ask you something?

Yeah.

What if you don't get in?

What do you do?


Um...

I don't know.

This is really difficult.


You just clip it.

I guess I'll...

Probably get a job with your dad

Or something in the finance

Industry.

Mm.

Well...

He could hook that up, right?

You seriously can't clip it?

[Door opens]

I got it.

Good.

Hey.


Hello.

Hey, have you, um, talked to

Your stepdad?

'Cause that would be really

Helpful.

Relax, I'm on it.

Dylan?

You want to come up?


Hurry up.

Uh [Chuckles softly] go throw

Yourself in my car, and we'll

Get you set up later.

[Keys jingle]

[Footsteps pattering]

[Keys jingle]


* get down for me

* I'll show you how to be

* all

* the people

* gather around them

* all

I can't listen to this shit.

You know why you smoke so

Much marijuana?

It all comes down to what kind

Of fish you are, fisher.

Yeah, you, my friend, you're

Like a...

You're like a dolphin.

See, you're way too smart for

The world.

School's too slow, so you smoke

Weed to slow yourself down, but

What you need to do... you need

To become a shark.


Like a fucking shark!

Kate, watch... stop!

[Tires screech]

Oh, my God!

Jesus Christ!

Is everyone all right?

Fuck! My eye!

Are you all right?

Shit.

No!

Oh, my God, I'm bleeding!

Let me see.

Oh, my!

Oh, put this on it.

Keep pressure on it.

Fuck.

Fisher, call the police!

Kate's hurt!

Call the police!

No, no, no, no, no!

No, I don't have a license!

No shit.

I know how to drive, okay?!


I just didn't get permission.

Permission?

Kate, it's a fucking

Government-issued license!

What are you talking...

Do not yell at her!

Put that out before I kick you

Out!

Now!

All right, dude.

She just almost got us k...

Kate, get over.

I'm gonna drive.

It's ridiculous.

She almost got us killed.

It's your fucking fault,

Fisher!

Right.

No, it's not funny!

I w... i wouldn't have been...

I'm not laughing, okay?!

Should've just been watching the

Road.

You're gonna be all right.

I wouldn't have been

Speeding!

You got me stoned from

Secondhand smoke!

U.S. stocks could open lower

By 300 points.

This is all because we're

Waking up to two fewer

Investment banks on

Wall street.

Lehman brothers has filed for

Bankruptcy, and

Bank of America's taking over

Merrill lynch in...



With my husband on the

Phone.

Well, what would you have me

Tell him?

Dylan?

Fuck, like, what am I

Supposed to tell him?

Oh.


Our lawyers found a way, okay?

[Cellphone ringing]

Guys, I'm getting ready to

Leave.

I want to get out of here.

[Ringing continues]


Hello?

I've been trying to get ahold

Of you for days.

Yeah, I-i-i know. I'm sorry.

What... what's up?

Phil told me about the

Accident.

Is Kate all right?

She's fine.

How's great neck?

Um, yeah, it's, uh...

It's actually pretty nice.

Huh.

Have you heard any news about

The application?

Uh, no.

I wanted to remind you about

Your mom's wedding coming up.

Look, I-i-i don't know how

Many times I'm gonna have to say

This.

It's not my wedding.

I'm not going.

It's not about you.


Um, I'll think about it, okay?

I got to go.

Bye.

Mr. Carson.

[Birds chirping]

Hey. Uncle Phil.

Hey.

So, Katherine has 18 stitches

Above her eye.

And you were smoking pot while

You were driving!

Fisher...

What are you thinking?!

W-what happened to

Responsibility?!

I don't know.

You don't know?!

I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry.

I know I messed up, and I'm

Sorry.

She's not gonna go to the

First week of school.

Fisher...

Why aren't you at work?

[Chirping continues]

Your aunt bunny and I are

Gonna...

Have a separation.

You know, i...

I do everything I can to make

Her happy.

Be living in a...

Guest room.

I'm...


I'm sorry. [Sighs]

No, no, it's fine.

I'm sorry.

Do you know how much a div...

Can you imagine?!

Can you imagine me with a

Divorce?!

You know how much money we're

Talking about?!

It's 50% in this state... boom!

It's 30% for Katherine!

It's 50% of my pension gone!

There's health benefits!

There's everything!

I'm gonna have nothing!

I-I'm watching my portfolio

Dribble down!

[Horn honks in distance]

Just d-don't tell your father.

Okay?

You do me a favor, and... you

Know, I got a lot of money tied

Up in the market, and it's...

It's all I got right now, and I

Don't need to hear his bullshit.

You got it.

You know, the "told you so."

I understand.

I won't say anything.

Okay?

Yeah.

And you know what?

You be what you want to be.

You want to be... you want... i

Don't... you want to be a

Gardener?

You be a gardener.

You want to be a-a photographer,

You be a photographer.

You take the best pictures in

The world!

Okay, you enjoy it!

There's no guarantees in life!

This week's assignment

Explores photography and

Politics.

In this year's historic

Presidential race, a single

Image can sway public opinion or

Bring about change.

These generations try to change

The world.

Did they succeed?

All right, that's it for today.

Emma, pick up everyone's

Assignments.

Fisher, I'd like a word.

Thank you for letting me sit

In on the class.

I really enjoyed it.

Your work with 35 is great.

Thanks.

Honest, raw.

I like it.

So, uh, you think maybe you

Could put in that good word

Then?


I already have.

I can't speak for admissions,

But I am rooting for you,

Mr. Miller.

[Chuckles softly]

Thanks.

[Birds chirping]

We don't want!

Your blood money!

We don't need!

Your blood money!

We don't need!

Your blood money!

No blood for oil!

Your blood money!

We don't want!

Your blood money!

We don't need!

Your blood money!

We don't need!

Your blood money!

[Up-tempo music playing]

[Indistinct talking]

* you walk with me when I'm

Burning bright *

What?

* you're with me in the

That's amazing.

That's amazing?

Yeah.

* and you see me when I'm

Look at the chandelier.

Oh, you like that chandelier?

Yeah, it's pretty nice.


You should see the one in the

Dining room.

It's even bigger.

Yeah, we should get you

Something maybe a little bigger.

I could totally get used to

This.

You like that?

Yeah, bigger's always better.

Hey.

This is America.

Hey, what are you doing here?

What are you talking about?

The only reason you're here

Is because of me.

Kate.

What... what's going on?

Fucking back off,

Housekeeper!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Hey, you two.

Can you keep her under control?

Hey does this bitch work with

You, Jody?

Sorry.

My cousin's had a bit too much

To drink.

No!

Hey. Unh-unh.

No, I haven't.

Okay, so they're both your

Cousins?

You rich people do some really

Kinky shit.


You're fucking desperate.

For what?

For what?

Dylan.

For what?

Yeah.

Did you think he was gonna

Help you get a green card?

Don't touch me!

Whoa, whoa.

Don't... okay.

Fucking bitch!

Are you just gonna let her

Talk to me like that?

I don't know what you want

From me here, okay?

This is my cousin.

Stop it!

Stop it! Okay?

You're gonna let her slap me

In the face?!

You're gonna let...

Okay, can you...

Let her hit me?

I don't even know what I'm

Doing here.

What are you talking...

You're right!

Leave!

Kate, all right, it's enough!

You're a child.

I don't even care about you.

I'm a child.

I don't even care about you.

That's great! Fine!

Then I'll see you later!

No, you won't see her later!

Shut up!

Okay?!

It's en...

I don't... i don't want to see

You right now.

Come on, let's go to my room,

Kate.

All right?


Stop, Dylan.

Navid, take us home now.

Now!

Wait! Hold on!

The party isn't over.

Navid!

No, Kate!

Kate, please, wait!

What?!

What do you want from me?!

I want everyone to have a

Good time, especially you.

I'm having a great time,

Dylan.

Shut the fuck up, and stop

Whining.

Maybe Kate wouldn't even care if

She knew your daddy warbucks was

Going to prison.

You weren't gonna tell her?

My family mistakenly invested in

Your dad's bullshit.

You got two seconds to get

The thing around your neck and

Yourself out of my house.

I'll see you later.

Get out.

Don't fucking cry, by the

Way.

Get out!

I'm leaving.

Turn this song off!

It sucks!

Fisher, turn this song off!

[Dance music plays]

These are not normal

Circumstances.

The market is not functioning

Properly.

Where's the recycling?

There's been a widespread

Loss of confidence, and major

Sectors of America's financial

System are at risk of shutting

Down.

The government's top

Economic...

Dylan?

Warn that, without

Immediate action by congress,

Amer...

[TV turns off]

Isn't it funny that the

Federal government, which is

Technically bankrupt,

Administers the bankruptcy laws?

Yeah.

You're very enlightened.

You sound like my dad.

Smart man.

I'm telling you... people are

Gonna rise up like a bunch of

Barbarians.

They're gonna pound on these

Gates, looking for a piece of

The pie.

They're not gonna get it.

That's what you need to

Photograph.


What do people say about me

Behind my back?

About you?

Nothing.

Everyone likes you.


Oh, by the way, my, uh... my

Stepfather said he'll meet you

Friday morning.

All right?

Don't mess it up.

[TV turns on]

Sorry.

Can we do another one?

You ready?

Awesome party, Dylan.

I can't wait for senior year.

All right. You got it.

That was great. Let's go.

Lock it up.

You're embarrassing yourself.

Wait for senior year.

All right. You got it.

That was great. Let's go.

I can't wait for senior year.

All right.

Dylan.

I can't wait for senior year.

[Jazz music plays]

[Rap music plays in distance]

Put your bra back on.

You bring the weed?

No?

Yeah. I, um...

Party's full.

I wasn't able to get any pot.

Sorry.

[Girls giggling]

Ladies.

Nice feather.

That'll be good on ecstasy.

[Giggling continues]

Hey.

Hi, handsome.

Nice robe.

Hi.


Did he leave?

He left.


Yo, fish!

He's just fucking with you,

Dude.

Time to meet Molly.

Take your pants off.

Let me see what you got there.

Come here.

Uh-huh.

Hey, drink up.

Yeah.

[Rap music continues]

That's good.

[Indistinct conversations]


Hey, man.

Here. I poured this for you.



The fuck is this?

It's piss!


Fucking even, bitch.

I got it. I got it for you.

Don't worry, fisher.

I got it.

Okay?

Don't worry.

You got it, right?

I got it.

How was it?

[Rap music plays]





Do you ever go to class?

What do we need school for?

Man, you learn from every single

Person you meet.

Mm.

You meet a stupid person...

They teach you not to be stupid.

You, my friend... you taught me

A very valuable lesson.


What is that?

Is that on the Internet?


Ohh.

Let me... let me see that.

My reputation's ruined.


All right. I'm kidding.

I'm kidding.

You know I think you're

Talented.

I saw some of your pictures, by

The way.

I sent them off to my stepdad.

He, uh... he really likes

Photography.

You like that one?

You like it?

Why don't you ask to try it on?

Hey, Kate.

What do you think about this

Ring?


It's an engagement ring.

No, I know, but do you like

It?

Yeah. I like it.

Uh, just find me another one...

Bigger.

Hey. What are you doing?

Oh, relax.

You're living with him next

Year.

W-what?

Did he say that?

Yeah.

Hey, fisher.

Shoot this.

The camera loves Kate, and I

Love Kate.


I've always loved you.

And I want to spend the rest of

My life taking care of you.

Will you marry me, Kate?

Dylan, your mother call on

Telephone.

She put freeze on her store

Account.

Uh, um...

Here.


So, where do you want these?

My room.

Honey, uh, we've got some bad

News.

Jack had a heart attack.

My dad... he's dead.

Kate, who gave you that ring?

It's nothing.

Goodness... so sorry.

It's okay.



I love you, too.

Looking out into this audience,

It's quite clear how popular my

Dad really was in our small

Community.


I know that he would have loved

That you all are here for one

Last party.


Uh...

Pathetic.

We love you, dad.

Tired of being around and

Feeling sorry for me, okay?

Hey, man.

Hey.

I'm so sorry.

Prick.

Is it too late to hit the

Back nine?

Sure.

Why don't you go stand in front

Of the fucking driving range so

I can knock your head off?

I can't deal with this guy.

Todd, I'm sorry.

Please give my condolences to

Your mother.

This course reminds me of

St Andrews... just not as nice.

Remember dad used to take me

To st Andrews every spring?

He used to take me everywhere,

Man.

My old man and I go in

November.

It's a flock of sea gulls, but

I'll take birds over tourists

Any day.

It's closed in November every

Year for remodeling.

You suddenly seem motivated.

I like that.

Perhaps let's play a game right

Now.

Happily, dude.

He was kidding.

Be careful of the wind, Todd!

Isn't my first time, dude!


Hey.

Listen.

Please don't do this.

Hold these.

I love you.


Onward.

Good luck! Don't choke!

No problem.

You're full of confidence,

Goodman.

Yep.

Let's up the ante... a wager.

Or do you not want to piss away

Your daddy's inheritance?

What did you just say?

You know exactly what I said.

I said, "does your daddy not"

Want you to piss away his

"Inheritance?"

Watch your mouth.

What are you gonna do about

It?

Stop it!

[Both grunting]

Hey!

Leave them alone!

Jesus!

Dylan!

Stop!

Both of you... Todd!

Let them fight over you!

Fuck.


Jesus Christ.

Fisher, do something!

Guys, stop it!

Get off of me!

You think I feel threatened by

Your little, juvenile,

Fairy-tale fascination with my

Girlfriend?

It's real, Todd!

That's what you can't get!

It's real!

Right, Kate?! Tell him!

Let's go, Kate.

Kate! Tell him!

Kate, come on!

Kate, get in!

Kate!

I'm leaving, fish.

Fisher!

It's been less than 72 hours

Since we listened to the

Chairman of the federal reserve

Tell us that we were only a

Matter of perhaps days from the

Beginning of a major economic

Collapse, the free fall of our

Financial markets, and the

Beginnings of a severe and

Protracted recession...

Shocking.

That could cost businesses

Going out of business...

You think this is funny?

Savings being wiped out.

This is a joke?

You think I fucked up?

You think I made this happen?

Everybody fucked up.


So, the sense of urg...

[TV turns off]

These are the fucking

Smartest guys in the room...

Fucking Goldman sachs and

Lehman brothers, bear stearns,

Merrill lynch.

The only fucking difference is

They get a golden parachute!

Your Uncle got shit!

The couch you're on, the fucking

Lamp, the table... all this crap

Is gone!

It's gone!

All this accoutrement, all the

Beauty is fucking gone!

Do you fucking understand what's

Going on?!

There's no fucking money in this

Family!

You're not mooching off of me!

I haven't got a fucking dime!

We're done!

We're fucking done, okay?!

The bank owns it all!

[Door opens]


You're so bad.

What are you doing?


Hey, whoa... hold... wait,

What's... what is this?

You're drunk?

You went to a funeral, and you

Drank?

Are you kidding me?

Are you...

Katherine, go upstairs.

Go upstairs.

Come over here, bunny.

You'd better talk to me.

Here's a fucking toast to your

Fucking Jack!

May his fucking rotting corpse

Rest in fucking peace!

Are... are you done?

Are you done here?

Jesus Christ.

I want you and you out of my

Fucking house!

Ha!

That's a fucking joke!

Out of your fucking house?!

You got our daughter drunk!

You got my daughter drunk!

You got my nephew stoned!

Oh, she's your daughter now?

She's your daughter?

When she's a problem, she's my

Daughter, but now she's your

Daughter?

I didn't get her drunk.

She got drunk all by herself.

You got no fucking

Responsibility!

I am so sick of looking at

Your face.

I'm sick of yours, baby!

I'm done!

I want a fucking divorce!

Well, you fucking got it!

I want you out of my fucking

House!

Okay?

You do shit!

You're gonna have to get a

Fucking job!

You're gonna get your shit out

Of m fucking house!

[Door slams]

Is Kate okay?

Did Todd hurt her?

Dylan?

What are you doing here, man?

Is she all right?

I swear to God, if Todd...

She's all right.

She's okay, man.

It's just not a good time for

You to be here right now, all

Right?

I'm sorry.

I know you're upset.

Everybody's upset.

Stop.

You really think you need

This?

Stop.

You really think this is

Important to you?

You think that she is worth all

This?

Stop, fisher.

No, listen to me, okay?

You're better than her.

You don't need her.

Stop.

I'm not gonna stop.

You need to go home, okay?

I don't have a home.

Don't have a fucking family.

No.

My head.

Oh, my God, it's like it's about

To explode.

I can see a little fucking train

Running through it just fucking

Kicking my head.

[Inhales, exhales shakily]

Kate.

Kate.

No.

Kate. I need Kate.

You don't.

Kate.

No, just come on.

Just go.

Fisher, stop.

I need Kate!

Dylan.

Kate!

Kate?

Kate, I can fix this!

Kate, I know you can hear me!

Please?

Kate?

Please?

I'll give you everything...

Anything you want!

Kate!

[Voice breaking] Kate.

Please...

Fisher, stop.


Kate, I'm the one for you.

Kate!

Fuck.

Fuck!

Dylan.

Fuck!

Just open the door, bunny!

I can't do it anymore!

[Indistinct muffled shouting]

I'm happy! You're happy!

Just listen to me for five

Minutes!

Let me talk to you!

[Shouting continues]

Sorry about your stash.

Todd will pay you back.

Don't... don't worry about

It.


What's up?

You know, I'm not the selfish

Girl that you're making me out

To be.

Open the door!

[Shouting continues]

Why didn't you come to

Grandpa's funeral?


I don't know.

I can't do this anymore!

[Pounding on door]

Open the fucking door!!

Please?!

You think you and I will be

Better parents?

[Shouting continues]

You know, my folks weren't

That bad, actually.


I think we'd make the best...

Couple if we weren't related.

[Shouting continues]


It's gonna be okay, Kate.

"Let him think and be still."

Do you hunt, Mr. Miller?

No.

Well, you ought to.

That quote was baloo teaching

Mowgli the law of the jungle.

It's a jungle out there, mowgli.

You know, I can't speak for

My entire generation, but...

What's the point of making all

Of this money if you can't

Connect with the people that you

Love?

You really should take up

Hunting.

Yes, you've reached

Dylan Carson, and, yes, I'm

Having a lot more fun than you

Right now, so you just leave a

Message.

[Thunder rumbles]

[Thunder crashes]

[Door closes]

Dylan?

Dylan?


[Thunder crashes]

Dylan!

Hello?!

[Rain pattering]

Shit!

Dylan!

Dylan!

[Voice breaking] Jesus.

Oh, my God.


God fucking damn it!

We're probably gonna have to

Ask you some more questions,

Son.

So, where were his parents in

All this... his other friends?

I don't know.


Knowing Dylan, would you

Classify this as an accident or

A suicide?

It was an accident.

Here.

Thanks.

Shake it.

We use the four elements...

The earth...

All: The earth.

The wind...

All: The wind.

The rain...

All: The rain.

The fire...

All: The fire.

To provide a sacredness to

Their vows, to honor the God

Above us, the God below us, and

The God within us.

Who has the rings?

I do.

I now pronounce you husband

And wife.

You may kiss.

[Cheers and applause]

I hope our ceremony will be

More traditional.

What about you, fisher?

Get in here.

Come on.

Yeah, fisher. Come on.

Okay.

Excuse me?

Oh, yeah?

Would you mind, uh, taking a

Picture of us?

Sure. Sure.

Hold this, please.

Just hit this button right

Here.

Okay. You got it.


Congratulations, all.

Thanks.

Thanks.

Everyone, smile.

Ah, beautiful.

Beautiful family.


Wait. One more.

Everyone, just keep that smile.

[Fun.'S "carry on" plays]

* if you're lost and alone,

Or you're sinking like a stone *

* carry o-o-o-n

* may your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground *

* carry o-o-o-n

* carry on, carry on

* so I met up with some friends

At the edge of the night

At a bar off 75 *

* and we talked and talked

About how our parents will die *

* all our neighbors and wives

* but I'd like to think

I can cheat it all *

* to make up for the times

I've been cheated on *

* and it's nice to know,

When I was left for dead,

I was found, and now

I don't roam the streets *

* I am not the ghost

You want of me *

* if you're lost and alone,

Or you're sinking like a stone *

* carry o-o-o-n

* may your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground *

* carry o-o-o-n

* whoa-a-a-a

* my head is on fire,

But my legs are fine *

* after all, they are mine

* lay your clothes

Down on the floor *

* close the door

* hold the phones

* show me how no one's

Ever gonna stop us tonight *

* because we are,

We are shining stars *

* we are invincible

* we are who we are

* on our darkest day,

When we're Miles away *

* so we will come

* we will find our way home

* if you're lost and alone,

Or you're sinking like a stone *

* carry o-o-o-n

* may your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground *

* carry o-o-o-n

* oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

* oh, whoa, whoa

* whoa, oh

* whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

* whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

* no one's ever gonna

Stop us now *

* no one's ever,

No one's ever... *

[Soft piano music plays]

* ode to the beautiful,

Desperate days *

* to the beauty borne

Of ash and flame *

* where truth and hope

Rise again *

* no way to know

That where we are now

Is where we should be *

* no way to know

If the things that were done

Were done willingly *

* but when the truth

Becomes a lie,

And the rays of your hope

Has flickered and died *

* these are the times

When you might sing *

* an ode to those beautiful,

Desperate days *

* to a beauty borne

Of ash and flame *

* where the truth and hope

Rise again *

* oh, those beautiful,

Desperate days *

* all the beauty borne

Of ash and flame *

* where truth and hope

Rise again *

* when you overcome doubt

* when you overcome fear

* on this you can count

* that's it's owed

To those beautiful,

Beautiful days *

* to the beauty borne

Of ash and flame *

* where truth and hope

Rise again *

* all those beautiful,

Beautiful days *

* all the beauty borne

Of ash and flame *

* where truth and hope

Rise again *

* rise again
