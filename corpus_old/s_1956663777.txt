<i>â™ª He looked kinda nice
And so I said I might take a chance â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I didn't know just what to do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I whispered, "I love you" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me â™ª</i>

<i>Adventures in Babysitting?</i>

Seriously, Lara Jean?

Now is not the time to be fantasizing
about living in an '80s movie.

Except for today, it's different
because it's not a fantasy.

This is my real life.

Don't I look different to you?

Um...

No.

Yeah, I don't see it.

How?

Like someone that has a boyfriend
would look.

You look like he's gonna be here soon
and you haven't started getting ready.

Have you even showered?

Get out.

How do I look?

Perfect.

You look fantastic, honey.

Okay.

[music swells]

Hi.

Hey.

What's up?

Nothing much.
No?

Got you something.

Oh, thank you.
Oh, hey, Kitty.

This is for you.

Gerbera daisies are my favorite.

Dr. Covey.

What restaurant did you pick?
'Cause I know some of the best.

Okay, Dad... here.
Put these in water. Go.

Say it out loud. Eleven o'clock?

Eleven o'clock.

Okay, have fun.

Not too much fun.

Bye.

[Lara Jean] This is good. Yeah!

[Lara Jean] It's so beautiful.

[both chuckling]

For the <i>signorina.</i>
Thank you.

And the <i>signor.
Grazie.</i>

Wow, they have big menus here.

The bigger the menu, the fancier
the restaurant. Everybody knows that.

It's actually a two-fork restaurant.

They give you the second one just in case
you knock the first one off the table.

No, that's not... that's not it.

That's what it is.
No, it's not.

Watch. You ready?

Peter, stop. That's so embarrassing.
[Peter] Oh, my God. What's happening?

[fork clattering]
Peter.

It's a good thing I have my backup.

Uh-huh.


This is my first date.

I've never been a girlfriend before.

I hope I'm good at it.

That's not a wish.
What do you mean?

It's not a wish. It's happening right now,
so it can't be a wish.

What?
What?

What's up?

I just don't want this to end.

You're thinking about <i>us </i>ending right now?

that popped in my head, okay? Just...

Well, tell that thought
to get out of your head!

You can't think about us
breaking up on our first date.

I just don't want us
to break each other's hearts.

I promise I am not going
to break your heart.

I promise not to break your heart.

[kisses]
Ooh.

Do you love it?
I do.

Look at that! That's awesome.
You have really great handwriting.

We can do it.

[Peter] You got it. Yes!
Whoo!

[both laughing]

Let it fill up.

That's cool.

Oh, my gosh!
[Peter] There it goes.

We did it. It's so beautiful.

You can still see our initials.
Mm-hmm.

[Lara Jean giggling]

I don't think I'm ever going to get used
to how deep your car is.

[Peter laughing] It's a bit...
It's so tall.

It is a pretty, pretty tall wagon.

When I get down, I feel like I'm falling.

Then you should wait. I'll come around
and catch you on the other side.

What?
So...

how was your first date?

And tell me like it wasn't me
who took you.

It was...

perfect.

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Okay, good night.

Okay. Good night.

That doesn't mean
you have to stay single forever.

[Lara Jean] <i>My dad says
it's important for us</i>

<i>to keep our Korean heritage alive.</i>

<i>But I know the real reason
we make such a big effort on the holidays</i>

<i>is because being around her family
makes him feel closer to my mom.</i>

So you have a boyfriend?

No offense or anything,

but I always thought you were
a "no dating till college" type girl.

His name is Peter, and he wouldn't be
dating Lara Jean if it wasn't for me,

'cause he didn't even know she existed,

but I mailed a secret love letter
that she wrote for him...

Well, technically, she wrote five.

Anyway, they started fake dating
to make his ex-girlfriend jealous,

and to cover up her real crush,

but everything got weird
and they started real dating,

and now they're real boyfriend
and real girlfriend and they are <i>adorable.</i>

Cute story.

A little PG-13, but cute.

Show Haven a picture of him.

Shut up. This is your boyfriend?

Yeah, why?

Dude, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

but I saw a video of him and some girl
doing it in a hot tub.

<i>For weeks, I prayed John Ambrose's letter
had gotten lost in the mail.</i>

<i>And when I never heard anything back,
I thought the nightmare was over.</i>

<i>But, I guess it wasn't.</i>

[John Ambrose]<i> Dear Lara Jean,</i>

<i>I couldn't believe when I opened that
letter and it was from you.</i> [chuckles]

<i>Wow. It's been, what, five years
since we've seen each other?</i>

<i>Not that I'm mad or anything.
I was so happy to get it.</i>

<i>I can't believe how mature you were at 11.</i>

<i>God, when I was 11, my mom was still
putting out snacks for me after school,</i>

that we both got locked out after school.</i>

[wind chime jingling]

was so much more than that.</i>

<i>I just have one question:
Why send it now?</i>

<i>Whatever the reason,
I'm really glad I got to read it.</i>

<i>Yours, John Ambrose.</i>

[Lara Jean] <i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>John Ambrose McClaren

<i>Wait, does this mean
he liked me in sixth grade, too?</i>


<i>Does he like me now?</i>

<i>Okay. Calm down.</i>

<i>It's not a spontaneous love letter

<i>It's more like a thank-you card.</i>

<i>There's no need to respond.</i>

<i>But... wouldn't it be rude not to respond?</i>

<i>It would definitely be inconsiderate,
so I respond.</i>

<i>But, in a friendly way.

<i>Thank him for his letter and move on.</i>

<i>I hope this letter finds you well.</i>

<i>Have you continued your interest

<i>I'm sure you're even more smart,
considerate, and adorable...</i>

<i>I can't say that.</i>

<i>Dear John Ambrose,</i>

<i>What lovely penmanship you have.</i>

<i>When I saw your name on the envelope,

<i>Dear John Ambrose,</i>

<i>First of all,
thank you for writing me back.</i>

<i>It's nice to be in touch after so long.</i>

<i>I do remember that day in the treehouse

I dunno. Maybe from...

didn't know what was going on between us.

That's not what's going on now, I hope.

Do you remember
when Kitty sent out my love letters?

Is that a serious question?

But...

who got the other ones,

and I said the last one
went to someone from Model UN?

Mm-hmm.

It was John Ambrose McClaren.
No shit.

McClaren? That was my boy.

Well, he wrote me back.

He wrote you... Like, an actual...
Like, an actual letter? Or an email? Or...

Yeah, like a real letter in the mail.

Huh.

He say anything about me?

Like what?
I dunno.

Like, "Um, how's Kavinsky?
How's he doing?"


Did you write him back?

Not yet.

Oh, so you're, like... you're, like,
going to, planning on it?

I probably should.

Why?
Because it'd be rude not to.

Then, I don't know why
you're telling me all this.

Are you asking for my permission or...

No, I just thought it was gonna be strange

Please choose
your service commitments wisely.

Yo, bro, so check it out.

We already snagged six spots

Everybody's in, done deal.

Come on.
Covey, let us sign you up.

Oakwood?
Yes.

I kinda thought we'd volunteer
at Belleview together.

Okay, I'm out. Uh, enjoy your fight.

Come on, let me sign you up. It'll be fun.


And, besides, Belleview looks better
on college applications.

I dunno, it was just the guys...
We kind of decided that

we were gonna do Oakwood
when training started. But, um...

You should go.
I'm gonna sign up for Belleview.

Are you sure
Mm-hmm.

Go sign up. Seriously.

Okay, well, let me make it up to you.

Let's meet after practice for coffee.

Five o'clock.

Sounds good.

It's epic.

Right. Because Dad,

Sounds a bit delusional, Kitty.

You also thought I was delusional

And, um, how did that one work out?

They just need a little shove.

Kitty.

Leave Dad and Mrs. Rothschild alone.

And, I'm gonna need that letter back.

Why?

Oh, you know, I just...
I wrote it a long time ago,

and I don't necessarily remember
what I said, so,

I guess I just wanna know
how mortified I should be.

Okay, okay. I will...

I'll bring you the letter
on one condition.

Okay, you have to return it
after you read it.

I just, I need proof that someone
actually liked me in middle school.

Are you kidding?

Everyone liked you in middle school.

Uh, I don't...
I don't really think that's true.

You know? But even if it was, I...

I didn't really care about everyone.


How's the patient?

Uh, she's... she's good.
She's embarrassed, but okay.

Don't want to get sued again.

You couldn't have liked us all the same.

Oh, and, uh, here is your card.

I love it.

One more thing.

Okay.

"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

of beautiful Lara Jean.

And stars never rise,
but I feel the bright eyes

of beautiful Lara Jean."

Do you like it?

Oh, my God. No one has ever
written me a poem before.

Like, seriously, this is
the most romantic thing ever. I...

Hey, Chris? Why are we in woodshop
for our Valentine's Subway tradition?

Woodshop is the only place
on campus I can stomach today.

Mmm.
I get ear bleeds from a cappella.

Did Kavinsky sic them on you?

Ah, no, he got me something better.

Nice! Boy's got game.

And, I got you a little V-Day gift
of my own.

Oh, Chris, that's so sweet...
It's advice.

Okay. [chuckles]

Before you go too far with Kavinsky,

make sure you are 100 percent...

No, 1000 percent sure...
That it's something that I want. I know.

Trust me, I'm not...
Actually, I was gonna say something else.

I am trying to make sure you know
how to rev your own engine

before you let anyone under the hood.

Chris, we all know
you can't wink. It's okay.

I'm just saying! Make sure you know
how to look after you!

Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it, thank you.


Mm-hmm.

Are you sure there's no other reason why
you wanted to eat in the woodshop today?

We both like the smell of sawdust
and that is not a crime.

I'm gonna go.

I think this is yours.

Thanks.


Shut up.

Oh! John Ambrose, good to see you again!
Hi, Mrs. Glick.

Oh, hi, John.

Today's gonna be a fun day.
I have an exciting project for you two.

Our annual Belleview garden party
is coming up.

Last year we got rained out,
so we decided to move it indoors.

So we're gonna do
the garden party in here?

Yup! Put out some potted ferns,
cheese platter.

I dunno, some twinkle lights?
It'll be fine.

But, I need you two
to clear out this space.

It's become a bit of a junk room.
Wow.

What is this?

Mr. Sawoski's failed green thumb attempt

and belongings of residents who passed.

Alone. With no family members
to claim them.

Make two piles, okay? Trash and donations.

When I heard "garden party,"
I imagined art deco elegance.

Not a couple potted plants
and a cheese plate.

Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of depressing.

Yeah.

Look at this.

Oh. Old love letters
from someone stationed in Italy.

He sent her his photo
with a note on the back.

"My darling Linda..."

Oh, this seems personal.
I feel a little funny reading this.

[John Ambrose] Wanna read this instead?

Remember, it's only a loan.

That it is.


Mm. Okay...

<i>"Dear John Ambrose,</i>

<i>do you remember the Halloween party
at Matt Kaplan's barn?</i>

<i>I planned my costume for weeks.
I was so excited.</i>

<i>I didn't tell anyone what I was gonna be.</i>

<i>And then, I got there.</i>

<i>It's like everyone except me
got the cool kid memo that</i>

<i>no one really dresses up
for Halloween anymore.</i>

<i>I felt so lame.</i>

<i>Like I didn't fit in.</i>

<i>And then, you walked in as a deviled egg.</i>

<i>And I realized...
maybe I'm lame in a cool way.</i>

<i>And that's when I knew.</i>

<i>I knew it all the way down
to my candy red sneakers.</i>

<i>I love you, John Ambrose.
I really love you.</i>

<i>Why, oh, why do you have to move away?</i>

<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again,
and you'll never know I felt any of this.</i>

<i>But, I'll know.</i>

<i>I'll always know that once upon a time,</i>

<i>my heart was yours."</i>

<i>I cannot believe I wrote that.</i>

<i>I cannot believe he read that.</i>

<i>I cannot believe he's downstairs knowing
I just read what he read that I wrote.</i>

[door closing]


I don't know.

Come into my room.

No woman should be out in public
with that look on her face.

"Maybe one day, we'll meet again.

I'll always know that once upon a time,

my heart was yours.

Love, Lara Jean."

Why?

Why did I write these stupid love letters?

I think it's exciting.

You predicted that you'd meet again.

And here you are.

I have a boyfriend.

So? Almost every one of my love affairs
overlapped with another one.

Well, this is different.

Peter and I promised
not to break each other's hearts.

Oh, honey, you're always
breaking someone's heart,

or they're breaking yours.

Well, isn't there a way
to both get out unscathed?

Not if you're doing it right.

I think it's time we both had a drink.

Stormy.

I'm 16.

Suit yourself.

More for me.

I'll just get you some soda.

When I was young, the drinking age was 18,

and you're not far from that.

That's about when I met my first husband.

How did you meet?

Oh, he was our neighbor.

And he was a songwriter.

And I can remember sitting around
our living room, listening to him sing.

And then one day,

I discovered that the song was about me.

If a man ever writes you a song,

then you know for sure
that he's got it bad.

What about a poem?

Well, yeah. Sure. Same thing.

A poem is just a song
without the music part.

For Valentine's Day,
Peter wrote me the most beautiful poem.

I bet you know it, too.


"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

of beautiful Lara Jean.

And the stars never rise..."

"But I feel the bright eyes

of beautiful Annabel Lee."

Uh, how did you...

Your young man has very good taste.
I'll give him that.

But I'm sorry to tell you
that the author of that particular poem

is Edgar Allen Poe.

You want to rethink that drink option?


[indistinct chatter and music]

Ah!

[laughter]
Oh, wait, come on. What was that?

Let's go, I ain't stopping!
[Gen] Let's take one for Insta.

Hi, Mom.
[camera clicks]

Now one for the real Insta.


The secret ingredient is...

Whipped cream?
That's why it's the...

Yeah, I think you should...

What?
Yeah.


Anywho, last ice cream sandwich.
You wanna split it?

Thanks.

Dude! Every time!

Not into flip cup, huh?
Like, ever.

Don't hate the player. Hate the game.

I just said I hate the game.

Okay. Spill it.

I just need a break.

From the contortions
of being someone's girlfriend.

Oh, no, what is he doing to you?

It's, like, mentally.

All right. Go on.
It's like this.

We're here and we're sharing
an ice cream sandwich.

And it's great.

But if Peter was here
and we were sharing an ice cream sandwich,

I don't know, I'd be thinking about...

has Peter shared an ice cream
sandwich with someone before?

And if he has, was it with Gen?

Does he think that I'm a prude

if I just wanna share
an ice cream sandwich?

Maybe it's me.

Maybe I'm the one who wants to do more
than just share an ice cream sandwich.

So the answer to all of those questions...

is... is I don't know.

Is this what happens in a girl's mind?

That's what goes on in this girl's mind.
Well, I am glad I am not you.

And not your ice cream.

So, back up.


Hey, Lucas?
Mm-hmm.

Do you remember John Ambrose McClaren?
Yeah.

Of course.

I was like obsessed with him
in the fifth grade.

Well, him and Michael B. Jordan in <i>Creed.</i>


I was obsessed with him in sixth grade.

He's volunteering at Belleview with me.

Not that it means anything.

I'm perfectly happy
in my relationship with Peter.

It's just like the stuff that I was
telling you about, like the overthinking,

that doesn't happen
when I'm with John Ambrose.

It's, like, easy.

But that's probably because
we're just friends, right?

You're lucky, LJ.

Lucky how?
You have options.

There's like, what, two gay dudes
at our school?

I'm sorry.

I've been thinking about my own problems
and not even...

thinking about what you're going through.


Listen,

sooner than we think,

we're gonna be out of high school
and we're gonna be in the real world,

and guys are gonna be lining up for you.

And what makes you so sure?

'Cause before I knew you were gay,

I was first in line.

Well, that was one hell of a speech
just to get another bite.

[Lara Jean chuckles]

[call phone chimes]

Wait, hold up. Are you guys texting
each other when he's just 20 feet away?

Hey.

Wanna go?

Okay.

Bye, Lucas.

Mm-hmm.

Good night, you two.

Yes, yes!
[laughing]

I didn't know you were friends.
[Chris] No.

Nothing to see here.
Mm-mm.

[Trevor] Leave.
[Chris] Bye, LJ.

Hey.

You okay?

Just, you were a little quiet tonight.

Can I ask you something?

Yeah. Of course.

the poem you wrote me.

I never said that <i>I...</i>

wrote... wrote it.

I'm sorry. Look, you were so happy

when I read it to you, that I...
I mean, I wished that I had written it,

and that I could actually write something
like that for you. I...

But you're the writer.

Are you mad?

No.

I love it.

That's good because
even if I didn't write it,

it's still how I feel about you.

Beautiful Lara Jean.

[Lara Jean] <i>Wow.</i>

<i>He's really good at this.</i>

<i>How is he so good at this?</i>

<i>And how does he know
how to do that so easily?</i>

How do you think?

You know what else he's really good at?

with you right now.

Oh.

That's all right. I... I wasn't...

I wasn't trying to have sex
with you right now.

I just... I want to put it out there.
Okay.

Just in case...

Give me some credit, Covey.
I don't want to rush you.

Especially not in a parked car
in front of your house.

[both laugh]

Did you feel like I'm rushing you?

No. Uh... it's just...

Remember that story about me and Peter
upstairs at last year's graduation party?

No, it's just...

You and Gen used to do it a lot, right?

Can we... can we not...

talk about Gen?

Oh, it's not about Gen, it's, um...

Do you miss sex?

Is there a void in your life?

Is there a void? No.

No.

No, not... not at all.


Okay, think of it like this. Um...

You've been base jumping before.

And I've never,
I've never been base jumping,

so obviously, I would ask you about it
in case it's something that

I would ever want to... do.

I promise if you ever decide
to go base jumping

that I would love to go with you.

It's just a... It's a big decision...

to jump off a cliff, so...

remember that.

Yes.

Okay.

I'm gonna walk you to your door.

Okay.
Okay.

[John Ambrose]
Okay, are we all comfortable?

Everyone good?

Yup,
All right.

We have a very big prize this week.

It is a wheel of aged gouda

donated by Mrs. Glick's son.
Thank you so much.

[applause]
Draw already!


First number is...

B-4.

Don't think I've forgotten
you haven't returned my letter.

[Lara Jean] O-62.

John Ambrose, you're not getting
that back. Too embarrassing.

[John Ambrose] B-11.

You want embarrassing?

Try navigating sixth grade Shakespeare
with a stutter.

I don't remember that.

N-32.

G-48.

Fine. But even with a mild stutter,
you were still a hot commodity.

At sleepovers, girls used to say,
"Are you Team Peter or Team John?"

G-60!

Yeah, that's just the thing.

Girls pretended to like me

because I was friends with Peter.

I-24.

You remember the sixth grade
graduation dance?

I couldn't believe when Sabrina Fox
asked me to go with her.

Couldn't believe it.

But then she tried to dance with Peter
the whole night.

Even during the slow songs,
when I couldn't pretend

like we were just dancing in a group.


Cut the chitchat.

Call the numbers.

[John Ambrose] I-25.

I can't wait to be at an age

where I'm not expected to think
that flip cup is fun.

Yeah, I mean, why do you think
we're both volunteering

and hanging out with the senior citizens
on a Saturday?

N-40.

Are we lame?

We might be a little bit. I-30.

But, lame in a cool way.

Totally lame in a cool way.

Yeah.
Are you kidding?


Whoo! I got BINGO.

[all groaning]

Suck it. [laughs]

[gasps softly]


So, um, speaking of Peter Kavinsky,

he told me to tell you
he says hi.

Oh, cool.

You guys still hang out.

We do, actually.

Is he... is he still like he was
in middle school?

What does that mean?

I mean like, okay, at parties and stuff,
he would always

take the last slice of pizza.

And then whenever you tried
to call him out on it,

he'd be like, "I'm an athlete."


And that one time, it was my birthday
and you made me those amazing

peanut butter chocolate cupcakes,
remember those?

Mm-hmm.
So good.

And he took the last one of those, too.

But we never even got mad at him,
'cause he's so...

Peter Kavinsky, you know?

Yeah. I do know. Um...

And...
Are he and Gen still together?

Huh?
I mean, they must be,

since you all still hang out.

No, actually Gen and I
aren't really friends anymore

and she and Peter broke up.

Huh.

That makes sense. No one really
stays together in high school, anyway.

Right. And on that note,

I think I should tell you...
[Dorothy] Oh!

What a wonderful team you make.

But this is wrong.

All of the bingo stuff
goes in the basement.

This needs to be cleared out
for the garden party.

I have to go make some prune daiquiris.

Hey, Dorothy!
Dorothy?

Did you know there's a basement?

[John Ambrose] Whoa.

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, there's a bust of Mozart over here.
I love his new album.


Hey.

Look.

Forget the stupid garden party
and the potted ferns. Like...

I think we should give the people
what they want.

An excuse to dress up
and dance like they used to.

Yeah?

I think we should bring back
the Star Ball.

I think it's crazy that people think
all old people wanna do is play bingo.

Yeah, totally.

I think it's a great idea.

Cool. [chuckles]
Although...

to be fair, I do think that old people
just really love bingo for some reason.


Yeah.

Do you know what all this reminds me of?
Hmm?

Uh, the time capsule.

Do you remember when we buried it?

Uh, yeah, it was during
one of our pizza parties at the treehouse.

The pizza parties...

Man, we had such good times
at that treehouse.

Just hanging, you know?

Reading.

There's something I need to tell you.

What's up?

Um... they are tearing the treehouse down.

Why?

The Robertsons are moving out

and the new couple,
they don't have kids, so...

The time capsule.

We should dig it up.

And rob future generations
of the discovery?

Future generations are gonna have their
hands full with deforestation.

Urban overcrowding.

And we'll probably be living underwater
at that point, right? [chuckles]

But it could be fun for us.

What do you think?

Yeah, um, that's a great idea.

And we can invite the other people
that were there when we buried it.

Yeah.

Yeah, totally. We'll...
We can invite everybody.

It'd be great.

I'll bring the pizza.

Maybe you can make those

peanut butter chocolate cupcakes?

What makes the octopus's
pulmonary system unique

is it has not one, but three hearts.

Make an incision underneath the ocellus

and you will see the branchial heart.

The octopus is a mollusk
and we will get to see one of those

during next week's visit
to the Portland Aquarium.

Mm-mmm.
Okay, here. I got this.

So what are you doing
this Friday? Are you free?

Uh, I'm not sure.

Um, why?

Do you remember the time capsule
that we buried in middle school?

Mm-hmm.
We should dig it up.

Just us?

Uh, no, the other people that...
that we buried it with.

So, Gen?
No.

I'm not inviting Gen.
She posted that video of us.

Well, we don't know for sure
that she did that anyway, right?

Well, I don't even think she'd come
even if we invited her, so...

It would be me, you, Chris,

Trevor, and John Ambrose.

So you... you, um. wrote him back.

Funny story, um...

we're actually volunteering
at Belleview together.

No way.
Yeah.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

Did you ask him to volunteer with you?

No, I didn't even write him back.
Huh.

Jeez, Covey, for a girl
who's never had a boyfriend,

you sure know how to mess with a guy.

[chuckles softly] Excuse me?

Time capsule.
Yeah, let's do it, what the hell?

We don't know what we'll find, right?

Cool.

Watch.

No, no.
Watch it.

Please, I...
Watch it.

Jesus...

["It Hurts" by Bad Bad Hats playing]


Peter prefers salted caramel.


[John Ambrose] Lara Jean.

[Lara Jean] Hey.

Two pepperoni pizzas!
That's probably enough, right?

Well, well, well,
if it isn't Johnny McClaren!

[John Ambrose] Peter Kavinsky.

Hey, man.

Good to see you.
Good to see you.

How you doing?
Good, you get pizzas?

What kind?
Yeah, pepperoni, just two pepperoni.

It's the safest.

[Lara Jean]<i> I didn't realize until
I saw them standing next to one another</i>

<i>what a spectacularly bad idea this was.</i>

Yo! You guys ordered 'za?

God, I am so hungry!

John!
Yeah.

You made it.
Yeah.

Dude, I can't believe you made it, man.

It's been so long!

Yeah, well, I mean, LJ and I
planned the thing, so...

Glad you could come.
Now we're just waiting for Chris.

So I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail?

Oh, my God. It's Gen and Peter!
Just like old times.

We doin' this or... or what?

Why are you, uh, comin' from the river?

I just buried a dead body.

Yeah, you're next!

Whoa, okay, calm down, Chris.
[Chris laughing]

Let me take this. You got it.
Oh, thank you.

My shovel.
I don't trust you with this thing.

Remember where we buried this thing?
Um, you need some help?

No, we're good, dude. Thank you.


[metal clanks]


She ate it from the bottom up.

She's saving the best for last!

That's the way to do it.

[laughter]
It just felt right.

Hey. Why didn't you ask me
to bring the pizza?

All right, let's bust this bad boy open!

Starting with yours truly.

La, la, la... Oh.

Who put this in?
I did.

It's just a bracelet.

It's not just a bracelet, I mean,

that piece of string was
the most valuable thing in your life.

I guess.

Baseball.

I am guessing you put that in.
Yeah, that was me.

This is when I hit a home run
at Claremont Park.

Wait, I remember that!
You came running off the field

and then you kissed me
in front of your mom. Remember that?

Uh, no. No, I don't remember that.


Ah, yes, the Linkin Park concert
at the Crystal Ballroom.

[Chris scoffs] Linkin Park? Nerd.
What?

Linkin Park slaps.

Oof.

Hey, McClaren, remember this? This is when
you hopped on the bandwagon,

and wore this hat every single day.
Oh, my God.

Wait, Lara Jean, didn't you get
a Seahawks T-shirt

'cause you were trying to impress John?

Uh, no.

If that's true,
that's really cute. [chuckles]

Hey, uh, McClaren,
remember when you had that stutter?

[Trevor coughs]

No... I just, I noticed you
don't have it anymore.

Yeah, well, dude, thank you.
Appreciate it.

I'm sure that my speech therapist

would love to know that her methods
were successful. [chuckling]

It's all good.

This is to future Chris.

Well, that's me. [laughs]

Whoa. Ha!

Genius then...

genius now.

Uh...

I don't know about that. I think a genius
would know the time value of money.

You know how like a 20 dollar bill now
is actually worth less

than it was six years ago.

You really got me.
I know.

Mm-hmm. You're the last one left.
What's inside?

Um, well, it's empty.

Impossible. You put something in there.
We all did.

Well, I don't really know what to tell you
because there's nothing in there.

Uh, does anyone want the last slice?

Too slow.

What?
It's getting too crowded in here.

[Trevor] Same.
Yeah, I'm out.

I can stick around and help you
clean up if you want.

I got it.
[John Ambrose] Oh, dude,

it's cool. I mean, I kinda helped make
the mess. But it's fine, I don't mind...

No, man. I think I can handle
helping my girlfriend clean up.

Thank you, though.

I'll go down. You wanna hand me stuff?

Okay.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Sure.

Why didn't you tell McClaren
that you and I are together?

Well, I wanted to. I tried to.
There just was never a good time.

Yeah, there's usually not,
when you're flirting.

Well, we weren't flirting. So...

Well, next time you need pizza,
just ask me. I'll get it for you.

What is it with you and pizza?

It's not about pizza.

If he brings the pizza then it looks like
you two threw the party.

It sort of was.

You can't do that, Lara Jean.

Not when you have a boyfriend.
Doesn't look right.

Oh, right.

So, like, inviting your ex-girlfriend
to your current girlfriend's party.

I did not invite her!
Like, officially. I...

I might've mentioned it.
Oh, yeah? When?

I don't know.

Why does it matter?
You're the one who arranged the pizza.

Okay, we're going around in circles.
Well, it's not supposed to be like this.

Then, how's it supposed to be?
I don't know. Not like this though.

Does that mean you wanna break up?

Wait, what? No! Why would you say that?

I don't know.

Is that why you didn't tell John about us?
So you'd keep your options open?

No! That's not the reason at all.

Okay, fine! Ever since we started dating
for real, I don't know how to act.

I didn't read the girlfriend's handbook.

Girlfriend's handbook?
Uh... what does that mean?

Like, little stuff. Like I remember Gen
used to dress up for your games.

Am I supposed to do that?
It's not just Gen.

Okay, all the girlfriends do that.

Okay, so, do you want me to?

I mean, no, not if you don't want to.

It would be nice,
it would show that you care.

Oh, like sending a serenade to someone
on Valentine's Day, maybe?

I... I didn't think that was your style.
I mean... [sighs]

Well, it's not my style.

Okay, so...

Let's never fight again, okay?


I got this.

This way.

[piano playing faintly]

[playing soulful song]

You have quite the ability
to remain sneakily silent.

I know I should've told you
about me and Peter.

It's okay.

Lara Jean, I...

I was just embarrassed.

'Cause I... I read it all wrong.


It's totally my fault.

I'm sorry.

Since we're, um...
Since we're coming clean

about stuff...

You know how you call me John Ambrose?

Everyone calls you that.

I know.

It's because of you.

What?

Before sixth grade, pretty much everybody
called me John.

And then I met you,
and you called me John Ambrose

and said how it was cool that we both
went by our first and middle names.

I didn't wanna correct you,

I liked how we had something in common.

So I started telling people
to call me John Ambrose.

Wow.

I don't know what to say.

Are we good, John...

Ambrose?

[chuckles softly]

We've always been good.

Lara...

Jean.

[plays quicker]


[Lara Jean]
Are we doing Brussels sprouts this year?

Ah, nobody really ate them last year.

Kitty says Fakesgiving's
all about the potatoes anyway.

Okay. Then, I think we're good.

On second thought,
I'll get us some Brussels.

Hi.
What you doing?


making a soup.

What you got there?
[giggles]

Ah, these are good.
Yes, yeah, those are... those...

[Lara Jean]
<i>I'd never seen my dad with a crush.</i>

<i>But, there he was,</i>

<i>laughing nervously with his hands
in his pockets.</i>

<i>He looks a little...</i>

<i>hopeless.</i>

Hi.
Hi.

I was supposed to get some
Brussels sprouts but I got distracted...

uh... for our...
Ah. I see.

Fakesgiving.
Fakesgiving.

It's like regular Thanksgiving,
but it's in March,

it's a family tradition.

Oh, my God, that's so fun.

You should come.


Oh, well, I-I don't wanna...

You don't wanna wait
till November for turkey.



Yeah, count me in.
Okay.

I'll, uh, I'll text ya the deets.


No one says that.
That's some nice lingo. [clears throat]

I'm glad you're coming.
Me too.

But there's something
that I should tell you.

You know that valentine that Dad sent you?

Kitty made that.

Wait, so you're telling me
that the valentine

that was addressed to Mrs. Rothschild
in glitter glue...


...wasn't from your Dad?

Well, that is a plot twist.


Wait, did Dad get Brussels sprouts?

He did not get the Brussels sprouts.

[Lara Jean] Dad.


Get more.
Okay.

That's not enough.
Okay.

[indistinct chatter]



Is something wrong with the green beans?

Uh, they're just a little un-Covey.

No? I mean everything else
on the table looks like it could be

in one of my mom's
food and wine magazines.

He noticed.
[Dan] He's got a good eye.

It's silly, we do a little thing
where I get a can of green beans.

No, it's symbolic.
I mean, it's kind of, um, for Mom.

Okay, it sounds like there's
a story there.

Is there a story?

Oh, when I was in college, I got invited
to a Thanksgiving party in a dorm room.

But the weird thing is,
it was the middle of March,

and the girl hosting it
was the coolest girl I ever saw.

Evie, their mom.

And she thought it was unfair
that the two best holidays of the year

were at the end of the year,
right on top of each other and

we should just spread the love
a little bit

and have a potluck for good ol' March.

Right, and at that potluck,
when everyone made homemade goods,

Dad brought

canned green beans.
Canned green beans.

Right.
[all chuckling]

And she made fun of him the entire night.

She made so much fun of me,
I thought she was really mad at me.

But after, her roommate told you that
that's just how she flirts, right?

See, she teases you.

Is that...
Nope.

Uh...


All right, well that is
a really sweet tradition.

Thanks for sharing that story.
Yeah, thanks.

Oh, there's one other tradition.

Yes. Newcomers have to eat the beans.

Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
Oh, it is very necessary.

Mom made you eat them,
and Margot made Josh, so...

Oh, well then, yeah. [clears throat]
That sounds pretty set in stone.

Okay.

Bottoms up.

I don't mind. I like canned goods.

That makes so much sense.
[laughs]

To Eve.

Evie.

Huh?

Nice?

You know what? It's not terrible.

Right?
There you have it.

[Trina] That's what that is.
Can you pass the cranberry sauce?

I'll cut some turkey.
Will you take this, hon?

Yeah, of course.
Okay.

[Trina sighs]


You've done this before, right?
Dad, that's not totally necessary.

[crowd cheering]

Yeah, yeah, whoo!

That last one hurt.

LJ! Like your look. Pete's gonna love it!

Dude, hey. Um...

What?

I don't know how to tell you this.

Well, just say it.

I just saw Peter and Gen together.

They seemed close.

Close like, um, how close?

Hi.

Were you with Gen today?

Uh, yeah. Yeah.

Here we go again.

Listen, she was upset
because there's some

things happening with her mom and her dad

and she just wanted to talk to someone
who understands.

That's it.
That's it?

Kavinsky! Let's go!

Peter, that is everything.

She is trying to prove that no matter
what is going on in your life,

when she calls, you come running.

And when push comes to shove,
you pick her,

you pick her every single time.

That's bullshit.

Okay? I pick you.

Lara Jean, when there was
an actual choice, I picked you.

An actual choice?
Like, what does that even mean?

She took that video, I told her that if
she ever hurt you again then we were done.

So you knew?
Yeah, Lara Jean...

You denied it.

Because you guys already have
so much bad blood between you two.

I didn't... Look, I was just trying to...

To protect her. Like always.

No. To protect you.

[Trevor] Peter.
Covey.

Seriously. Let's go.

Sorry, LJ, but, yeah.

Can we please talk about this later?

How did she know?

What?
That night.

I said I was going to bed. And Gen knew
exactly where you were. How did she know?

[bus engine starting]

You were waiting at the hot tub
for her, weren't you?


You and I weren't, like,
really together yet.

And that's why she took the video.

And if I hadn't come down to find you,

you and Gen would be together,
and you and I would've never happened.

Maybe that's how it should be.

Don't say that. You don't mean that.

You should go.

D-Don't do this, Covey.
Go.

No, we promised that we were not going
to break each other's hearts.

Yeah, well, I think that we both
made promises we couldn't keep.


Right.

[bus door closes]

[bus drives off]

I miss you, Mom.

I wish you could tell me what to do.

[light knocking at door]


It's a quarter to eight.

I know.

[Lara Jean] <i>I thought that

[ladder creaking]

Wondering why I've got this life â™ª</i>

[footsteps approaching on ladder]

Hey.

Hey.

I guess you know Peter and I broke up.

Yup, I heard something about that.

Part of the reason was
because when he was with me,

I always thought
he was thinking about you.

And that I would never be good enough.

I was convinced that he was never
really gonna get over you.

And then I realized that

the person who couldn't get over you...

was me.

You probably don't remember this, but...

I put this in the time capsule
because it's our friendship bracelet.


You know, you're way off about Peter.

He's crazy about you.

He tells me that himself.

And the reason that I call him
is not to hurt you.

Just...

Um...

My parents are splitting up right now,

and it's just really confusing.

Peter's been through it, you know?

I hid this over there because

I didn't want you to know
that I put the same thing in.

[Lara Jean] <i>There's a Korean word

<i>It's called </i>jung.

in your heart for them.</i>

Oh, there you are. Come in, sweetie.


You look amazing.

And you look like a girl
not ready for the ball.

Yeah, well, I'm just a volunteer.

It'd be weird if I dressed up.

Ah. Oh, well...

I guess you won't be needing this, then.

Sort of a shame
that you don't want to dress up.

Gosh, this would just...

look so lovely on you.

But, there you go.

Stormy.

Give me the dress.

How do I look?

The way you look

should be against the law.

<i>â™ª Tonight â™ª</i>

Wow.

Hi.

<i>â™ª So Iâ€™m crashing here tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, Iâ€™m crashing here tonight â™ª</i>

Thanks.

I'm glad I decided to dress up.

Oh, great.

Yes.
Yeah.

It seems as though
they want us to dance.

give the people what they want.

We're finally dancing.
Mm-hmm.

I...

wanted to ask you
to the sixth grade dance.

Yeah.

I actually went to your house.

I gathered up a whole bunch of sticks,

and I arranged them in the letters
D-A-N-C-E,

with a little question mark at the end.
Yeah. Right outside your window.


And then your dad came home.

I'm pretty sure he...

Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he thought that I was

cleaning people's yards.


So he gave me ten bucks,

and I just, I got super nervous.

So I went home.

I can't believe that.

Yeah.

It's actually...
It's kind of embarrassing now.

<i>â™ª 'Cause I'm young as I'll ever be â™ª</i>

probably melt by morning.

Okay. Okay.
No.

You know where this is going, right?
No! No, no, no. No!

What are you doing?

[John Ambrose] Snow angels.


Are you cold?

Yeah, I'm freezing.
Okay.

[both laughing]

Come on.

It's Peter.

I'm sorry.

[panting softly]

Lara Jean.

Are you all right, honey?

We kissed.

But, I...

I wanted him to be someone else.



And now I feel like I ruined everything.

No, no. You're too hard on yourself.

Sometimes you have to kiss the wrong man

to know what's right.

I have.

More times than a lady should admit.

But what if it's too late?
I mean, Peter and I, we broke up.

So what? Unbreak it.

If that's what you want.

And if he doesn't?

If he doesn't what?

Want me.

Well...

that will hurt like hell.


Okay. Uh, Stormy?

Mm-hmm.

Can I bring you back your dress tomorrow?

No.

Because it's yours.

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

I have... I have to go.

Go.
