[Crowd humming
"The Battle Hymn of Republic"]

[Tambourine playing]

MAN: I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

and to the Republic for which it stands,

one nation under God
with liberty and justice for all?

My name is Jimmy Carter,
and I'm running for president.

[Cheers and applause]

1976 will not be a year
of politics as usual.

Yes!

It can be a year
of inspiration and hope.

And it will be a year of concern...

Hey, Jimmy, check this out, man.

And sober reassessment
of our nation's character and purpose,

a year when voters have
already confounded the experts.

And I guarantee you
that it will be the year

when we give the government
of this country

back to the people of this country.

[Cheers and applause]

WOMAN: Honey, is that for me?
What is it?

MAN: For you.

Honey, you didn't wrap this yourself.

You know I did.

Gary!

It's beautiful.

I mean, it's too much.

No. McMillan's leaving.

So it's definite.

It's my case now.

Oh!


-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

And I want you to handle it.

Are you sure?

Because I can be difficult.

Hey, thanks a lot.
Drive safe.

Make a left up on Sheldon.

That'll take you right back
to where you're going.

Got everything?

All right, be safe.

[Siren wails in distance]

Be safe, all right?

[Piano playing slow gospel music]

WOMAN:
? Oh, Jesus, please ?

? Accept my prayer ?

? Oh, without your guidance ?

? I can't find peace anywhere ?

? The love I have for you ?

? Is like no other love
I've ever known ?

[Singing continues faintly]

MAN: I didn't think you'd show up.

This is Asheema.

A'salaam alaikum, sister.

This is Marcus.

My brother.

Come on, boy!

Iris!
Do you want to make a dollar?

-Two.
-$1.25.

$1.50.

So listen...

I got a new contract out in Pottstown.

Try to get me at least
1 0 pounds more next time.

I'll see what I can do.

Hey! Hey, hey, hey, Harrison!

Where's the rest?
Rates keep dropping, Jim.

Guys like us are taking the hit.

[Door closes]

[Engine starts]

You, bastard.

[Siren wailing in distance]

Guy pop hired doing a shitty job.

Everybody's heading over
to the funeral home.

You coming?

How much is he charging you?

Why?

I could do it for you.

For free.

Put a little money
back in your pocket.

Already got a buyer.

But, um, if you want
to clean up around here,

you could stay a few days.

He left you the house.

Well, no one's heard
from you for four years,

so, yeah, he left me the house.

We ain't even got him
in the ground yet,

and you got a buyer?

It's just the way things worked out.

And I changed it back.

The ?ible verse?
I put it back the way it was.

Surprised you still care.

Genesis 42:21 is what he wanted.

It's your world, Bos.

Can I get through?

What's that say?

I know the owners.

It says I can take
what I want when I want it.

Leave the cart, kid, and take off
before you get yourself in trouble.

I got business to run, man.

You don't listen too good,
do you, kid?

I said get outta here.

Asshole.

What did you call me?

Hey!

What did you call me?!
Come over here!

Come here.

Come on, Frank. It's lunch.

Kid's got a mouth.
I got a right to know my charges.

And he's still talking.

So I talked to Judge Thomas
about my cousin Jimmy's case.

They want to hold him
till he pays the full fine.

The court charged him with what?

Verbal assault.

And awarded the city... mm-hmm.

$400?

Thank you, Bean.


So I want to try
to get him out tonight.

And you know I wouldn't ask
unless I had to.

Well, you know, a couple days
in county might not be so bad.

I mean, it might straighten him out.

Or he might not survive it.

Thank you.

Thank you, Bean.

I can't, Patricia.

Not this time.

I don't know how much more
of this I have in me, Jimmy.

I can't keep doing this for you,
you know?

I can't just bail you out.

It's not like I have it in me
to keep showing up,

making it okay
when you screw up!

This is stupid shit, Jimmy!

It's really stupid shit!

[Radio playing indistinctly]

[Shouting indistinctly]

[Door closes]

[Gospel music playing on radio]

-Ma?
-Hmm?

Who's this?

CARTER: Our people are searching
for new voices and new ideas...

Were you in my office?

No.

What's his name?

Marcus.

Daddy's friend?

Go brush your teeth.

How come we never
can talk about dad?

We just talked about him.

-No, we didn't.
-Iris.

He was here, you know.

-Who?
-Guy in the picture.

You know,
I don't like when you lie.

Not lying.
He was out there in the street.

I know it was him.

Was he a Panther?

Yeah.

...realists who still know
the old dreams of justice and liberty

of country and our community.

Was wondering when you'd show up.

Here I am, baby.

What can I do for you, Dwayne?

Oh, that's how it's gonna be?

That's your name, ain't it?

I got a message from the brothers.

They sent you?

Things done changed, Snitch.

I'm in charge now.

Same old Dwayne.

Got everybody fooled, huh?

Look, I'm only here for a week.
Then I'll be gone.

Oh, you think that changes things?

Go home... Dwayne.

Call me that again.
Go ahead, say it again.

See what happens.

You're not even gonna
see it coming, Snitch.

One day the light just gonna go out.

Pop.

Nobody's forgotten
what you did to Neal.

[R&B music playing]

Hey.


Wasn't expecting anybody.

[Click, music stops]

I'm sorry about the Reverend.

Things are good?

Yes.

You know.

You?

She's a curious one, isn't she?

What, 8? 9?

No, no.
You might offend her.

She almost 10.

[Both chuckle]

She looks just like him, Pattie.

Nobody calls me Pattie anymore.

I don't know you as anything else.

Iris?

It's time to say good-bye.

Find anything interesting?

No.

I have this box of comics
I was gonna throw away.

But if you want it...

-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

REPORTER: FBI director
J. Edgar Hoover today

asserted the hostile black
extremist group

the Black Panthers represent

the greatest internal threat
to the nation....

MAN: Are you listening, people,
to what I'm saying?

'Cause it sure looks to me
like them niggers ain't playing.

WOMAN: Them niggers ain't playing.

MAN: America taught
the black people to be violent.

We will use that violence...

[Crowd cheering and shouting]

[Crowd noise fades]

[Telephone rings]

Hello?

It's Patricia.

So we're having a potluck tomorrow.

If you don't have plans,
you should come by.

It's a fundraiser for one
of my cases that can't make bail.

I will. Thanks.

A-and it was good seeing you, Pattie.

Take care.

[Indistinct conversations]

[Disco music playing]

Where you off to?

Haven't decided
if I'm gonna leave yet.

I can talk to them
if you want me to.

They listen to me.

I can take care of myself.

Let me, uh...

[Indistinct conversations]

[Spray can rattles]

[Spray can sprays, man hoots]

Motherfucker.

[Tires screech]

Where's DoRight?

He ain't here.

If I was you, I'd get outta here.

I'm right here, T.
You don't know who that is?

We are in the presence of royalty.

You know, Neal was the pretty one,

but this nigger,
this nigger was the workhorse.

Stay away.
I'm asking you nice.

What?
You want to start some shit?

Wanna start some shit...

We can get it on.

My daddy loved that car.


Come here.

What the fuck is going on here?

Nothing, I got 'em lined up.

What the fuck you talking about,
they lined up?

You got 'em on the curb without
their fucking shirts and shit?

Undressed? Strip-searched?
What the fuck are you doing?

I'm doing my job.

Don't you fucking walk away from me.
Step here.

You better step back, motherfucker.

You cannot do this shit.

We got some constitutional
issues here, motherfucker.

God damn it, let 'em go.

Get up! You heard him! Up!

All of 'em.

Come on, fellas.
You can go.

Come on, man.

I can't make it on this!

What, you think I can?

I'm paying you a quarter
above market rate, Jim.

Aw!

What are you doing?

Today's the last day
you're gonna cheat me.

Cheat you?
What do you mean cheat you?

I can take my shit over
to Freddie up on Wayne Avenue!

Guy's a thief.
He'll pay you half what I pay you.

From now on, I only do business
with the brothers.

Why y'all just standing there?!

He's one stupid-ass nigger.

You look thin.

How long you been back?

Come on, Marcus.


I'm not the enemy.

In fact, I came here to tell you
you still got a friend.

Can I go?

If I was you,
I'd stay away from that bar.

DoRight's a criminal.

He's putting guns
in the hands of children.

And Pattie?


You two used to be tight, right?

Well, now...

She's getting DoRight
and his crew off on technicalities.

They have lost their way.

You finished?

I asked you to clean up.
That's it.

This is not your house.

You don't get to come in here
and do what you want.

Put it back the way it was.

You're out of your mind.

-Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?!
-This is not your house!

You don't come in here
and make decisions!

You don't get a say!

Run.

It's all you ever
been good at anyway.

I now it was hard
for you when I left, Bos.

But it wasn't my fault.

I had to go.
You understand that?

I didn't have a choice.

And now?

Whose fault is it now?

Stop asking me questions.
Sit down.

-Hello, my sister--
-Where is he?

Where's the boss?

DoRight?! Where you at?

You know why I'm here, right?

Are you serious?

Yeah, I mean it.

Stay away from him.

Motherfucker comes into my place,
you come laying this shit on me?

You went after him.
I know you, Dwayne.

You've never liked him.

Why you taking up for this guy?

'Cause that's what I do.
For all of you.

Are you with him?
I'm just asking.

Look, you know he always
had something for you.

Do you have something for him?

It's always the same shit with you.

You're paranoid.

The feds own him.

He's their inside man, their boy.

So you bought the same bullshit story
everybody else did.

No, I know! I know!

Tell me what you think you know.

I know that he sold Neal to the feds.

I know they pumped
1 6 bullets into my best friend

in your living room
on his information, I know that.

It wasn't Marcus.

Okay, so, then,
who was it, then, huh?

Maybe it was you.

You know what?

No one is gonna lay a hand
on that brother's head.

You satisfied?

But let's be clear,

do not come back in here
asking for any favors.


She didn't say anything
about my case, did she?

-T.T., are you serious?
-Just checking.

What are you doing here?

Did Bostic kick you out?

We have an extra room.

No, thanks.

So you're just gonna continue
sleeping in your car?

-I've done it before.
-Then why would you do it again?

I'm fine, Pattie. Thanks.

[Scoffs, chuckles]

[Car door opens, closes]

[Engine starts]

There's too many pigs, man.
There's too many pigs.

Jimmy, right?

Peace, brother.

Right on.

Come on, Colin.

BOY: All right, guys, see you later.

All right, see you later.

You again.

Iris.

That work?

Sometimes.

Ma's in the kitchen feeding
the whole neighborhood.


PATRICIA: Amy, you need
to slow down while you eat.

You don't need to stuff
your face like that.

A lion!

A tiger!

That was my--

I like--I like tigers.

And a jaguar.

And monkeys.

And chimpanzees.

I like a ferret.

[Indistinct conversations]

Okay, all right, celery and carrots,
and who wants some fruit?

-Me!
-I do.

Well, come on and get a bowl, then.

Didn't I tell you to finish your milk
before you have any more sweets?

What are you doing?

There's something very
f-f-fishy about this ship.



[Click, cartoon soundtrack]


I won't tell if you won't.

How you learn to do that?

Been on the road awhile.
Learn a few things.

It's what you do for a living?

This and that.

-Odds and ends?
-Yeah, odds and ends.

That means you do nothing.

Yeah? Is that what it means?

It true you were in prison?

Yes, it is.

What'd you do?

I sold guns.

I got caught.

My father sell guns, too?

Sometimes, yes.

-You're lying.
-I don't lie.

-Did he get caught?
-No, he was smarter than I was.

What was he like?

Well...

You look just like him,
but you act like your mom.

I want to know how he died.

What did your mama tell you?

She won't talk about it.

She probably has good reason.

She keeps secrets, you know.

That's what mom-mom
and pop-pop used to say.

One time, I heard them
call her a communist

like it was a dirty word.

Then they started following us.

Who's they?

The F?I.
They follow us home sometimes.

Then they started
tapping our phones.

Still do.

See? Hear that?

[Dial tone]

If you listen for a long time,

you can hear it goes like,
click... click... pop.

Can't you hear it?

He was killed here, you know.

Ma thinks I don't know.

It was in here in the living room.

Jimmy says he shot 50 cops
before they got him.

-He has nowhere to go.
-Could you put us first for once?

That's not fair.

No, what's not fair
are those grubby kids

who steal my change
when I'm not looking.

Gary!

Or your cousin Jimmy who lived
on the third floor for over a year

so we can never have sex.

Is that what you want now?

-No, that's not what I want.
-Then, prove it.

You could, uh, you could
always move in with me.

No.

No, I live here.
This is my home.

I have roots here.

You're living in the past, Patricia.

This house... this neighborhood...

You're all fighting imaginary enemies.

He loves you, Iris,
and that's not gonna change.

No, he doesn't,
and I'm glad he's gone.

You're the one who's upset.

I'm upset because I care about him,
and I think you do, too.

No, I don't.
You're lying. You always lie.

Hey. Look at me.

Look at me!

Have a little respect.

Now how are we supposed
to pay the electric bill?

Go get ready for bed.

[Engine idles, stops]

[Chatter over police radio]

What you doing?

Marcus...

Somebody's watching the house.

Feds aren't interested
in us anymore, Pattie.

It's Gordon.
He's out there because of me.

But if you wanted to get me
alone in the dark...

...all you had to do was ask.


I don't have to ask you anything.

Hm.

Ma!

Did you brush?

I brushed,
and I'm ready for bed.

I'll be up in a minute.

What are you looking at?

Well, we don't have a lot
of rules around here.

But we don't talk about the past.

It's too painful.

For her or for you?

For both of us.

Thank you, comrade.

[Clears throat]

Good night, Marcus.

Come on, man,
leave him alone, man.

-He ain't do nothing wrong.
-Just gimme my bicycle.

You don't think I didn't
see you yesterday?

-That was my cousin's bike.
-Whose bike is this?

My bike.
I just told you it's my bike.

Can I just have my bike back?

I'm not lying to you.
That's my bike.

-Got any drugs on you?
-No. Why would I have drugs?

I got a little girl crying,
saying it's her bike and you stole it.

-What little girl?
-Little girl up the street.

-Whose bike did you have yesterday?
-That was my cousin's bike.

Come on, man,
leave him alone, man.

-He ain't do nothing wrong.
-Just gimme my bicycle.

You don't think I didn't
see you yesterday?

-That was my cousin's bike.
-Whose bike is this?

My bike.
I just told you it's my bike.

Can I just have my bike back?

I'm not lying to you.
That's my bike.

-Got any drugs on you?
-No. Why would I have drugs?

I got a little girl crying,
saying it's her bike and you stole it.

-What little girl?
-Little girl up the street.

-Whose bike did you have yesterday?
-That was my cousin's bike.

You hear that, pig?!

Don't come back
to our neighborhood!

The vanguard has declared
all-out war on your ass!

Get down!

Let's go! Come on! Let's go!


? The revolution has come ?

? Stop the pigs! ?

? It's time to pick up a gun ?

? Stop the pigs! ?

? It's time to pick up a gun... ?

I let her go to the corner store
with me today and...

Jimmy got into it with a few cops.

Some cats drove by
and shot out their back window.

She's fine.
Everybody was fine.

I just wanted to tell you.

I didn't think it'd be right
if I didn't tell you.

Thank you.

Jimmy...

...is crazy, Pattie.

He's got a brick between his ears.

And that's putting it nicely.


Kid's walking around
talking about the vanguard,

calling cops pigs like he knows
what he's talking about.

I don't think you should let
Iris work with him anymore.

She could really benefit
from having you around.

She's never had that before,
you know? A man.

I, uh...

I work night court on Wednesdays,
but, otherwise, I'm home by 6:00,

and I could pay you--

I can't take your money.

What about Jimmy?

I'll take care of it.

How are you gonna do that?

[Clears throat]
Don't worry about it.

JIMMY: Look at that. Wow.

Man, the Panthers,
they were like my family, man.

I mean, our family, you know?


They defended us against the pigs.

They didn't want us to have nothing,
didn't want us to live.

Pigs ruin everything.

How old are you now, Jim?

18? 19?

-It's just you and your brother, right?
-Yeah. So?

Your old man,
what happened to him?

Wayne?
That was his name, right?

Used to run the body shop
down on Germantown Avenue?

Go on outside.
I'll meet you out there.

Go outside.

Don't talk to him.

He'll be out when we done.

So you knew the old drunk.

Are we supposed to be friends now?

We ain't friends, Jim.

Don't come back here.

And stay away from Iris.

-You don't scare me, Marcus.
-I ain't trying to scare you.

I don't give a damn
who you used to be.

I don't give a damn
about any of you.

Got my own plans.

-Plans.
-Big plans.

That comic, where'd you get it?

I took it. So what?

Give it back.

This ain't your house, man.

You know why I loved Neal?

'Cause he killed some cops.

He went out like a man.
And what'd you do?

I survived.

Surviving ain't worth much
if it's in another man's blood.

You don't know shit!

I know you a snitch.

I know you a chump.

I'm a chump?

The feds printed these comics
for people just like you.

Now you call me a snitch again.

You don't know shit.

[Footsteps approach]

Where do you get off
threatening him?

I talked to him.

I told you
I would handle that, right?

You think you can make him
act nice when you want to?

A kid like that
with so much to prove?

Iris is all you have.
Nothing else should matter.

Stop trying to tell me
how to raise my kid!

Then stop
acting like Mother Theresa

every time an orphan
walks through the door!

You, of all people,
lecturing me on commitment.

Where you been, Marcus?

All this time.

Where did you go?

It must be nice... to just...

...come in and out...

Pack only what you can take in
that little black bag of yours.

If you want to have a say
about how things go around here,

that's available,
but you have to stay.

Are you ready for that?!

-I'm done waiting.
-Pattie--

Stop calling me "Pattie"!
That is not my name!

What should I call you, then?

Hm?

I'm sorry.


Oh, God!

Aah!


Jimmy can't come here
anymore, Patricia.

Pattie.


-Ma?
-Hmm?

How come we never move?

What do you mean?

Ever since dad died,
how come we stayed here?

It's complicated.
A lot of reasons, I guess.

It's strange, though.
I mean, it's not normal.

Ma?

Okay, Iris, I just--
give me a second.

I need to finish this, okay?

[Siren wailing in distance]

[Men shouting, gunfire]

[Indistinct radio chatter]

[Helicopter whirs]

[Crowd shouts]

[Siren wails]

The year you were born...

...two Panthers
were killed by the police.

And your father... was outraged.

So he and some other
Panther members,

they decided they were gonna
kill a police officer.

And I tried to convince him not to.

We all did, Marcus and uncle DoRight.

But he wouldn't listen.

Did he do it?

But that's not who we were.
That's not what we did.

Your father became angry.

Disillusioned maybe.

You were 8 months old,
and nobody was safe.

I didn't know how I was gonna
keep this family together.

The night they caught me,
we were taking you to my parents.

We?

Me and Marcus.

I loved your father so much.

They were going to send me
to prison, baby.

And you would have been put
in the system,

and I couldn't lose you, so I--

So I gave him up.

I told the cops... he was the one.

That was the deal.

Neal...

...for you and your mom.

I didn't know they were
gonna kill him, Iris.

Iris.

They're all around us.

Ghosts.

They're everywhere.

[Siren approaching]

Down on the ground.

Okay, [grunts] all right.
[Handcuffs click]

Aw, fuck.

Hello, Marcus.

Get the fuck off me!

Fuck.

Now, this is what we gonna do.

DoRight and his crew
shot up a patrol car.

They going after cops now.

I'm gonna bust 'em,
and you gonna help me.

Plant this piece behind the bar.

Fuck you.
You plant it yourself.

Okay, now, who do you think
you're talking to, boy?

I own you.

So do what you're told,
or I'm gonna make sure

everybody knows
that she's the real snitch.

Huh?


Yeah.

She and the kid
are gonna be run out of town.

There's gonna be
a big bull's-eye on her back.

And maybe just one of these
young bucks with a lot to prove

is gonna put a bullet
in her head one night.

You gonna place this piece
behind the bar.

And we gonna keep
our little secrets.

Ah, that's right. Wipe it down.

Now, you took the blame
for something you didn't do.

Now, what kind of man does that

for a woman who's carrying
a torch for somebody else?

Fuck you.

You plant that piece, boy.

[Indistinct conversations]

You know what I think, T.T.?

I think he just misses me.

Are you here to set me up?

Son of a bitch!
T.T.!

Come here!

-Are you wearing a wire?
-No!

I threw it in the gutter
before I came in here.

-The wire?
-A gun.

They wanted me to bring it in here
so they could set you up.

I knew it.

I knew it!

Get out of here.

What?

Go, go. Go on.

[Door closes]

Why didn't you go through with it?

[Exhales sharply]

[Woman screams]

MAN: Oh, shit!

MAN: We need everybody
to clear out of this area.

[Siren wailing,
indistinct conversations]

Iris!

What did mama tell you
to do right now?

When face to face
with a policeman,

I should keep my mouth shut,
say nothing unless asked,

answer questions
with "yes, sir, no, sir,"

unless they violate
my civil rights.

Then put my hands on my hand
where they can clearly see them

and ask for a lawyer
and never make sudden moves

and never get angry.

What were you doing in the kitchen?
What were you doing in the kitchen?!

Marcus! Move!

What are you doing here?
What did you do? What did you do?

You gotta get out.
You gotta go out the back door, go.

-Mom, please--
-No, shh!

-Where am I supposed to go?
-I don't know!

[Pounding on door]
You're supposed to help me!

-Please, Ma!
-No! Stop! Shit!

Wait, wait! Wait, wait!

[Pounding continues]

Shit!

Pattie?

Okay, after this,
I do not ever want to see you again.

Go.

[Pounding continues]

Pattie!

I need to search your house, Pattie.

It's just me and Iris.

Look, I want to find out
who's responsible for this.

Responsible for what?

A cop is dead!

This is fucking critical!

I'm very sorry
about your police officer,

but I don't know
anything about it.

So unless we're under martial law,

you're gonna need a warrant
to get in here.

What the fuck you looking at?

Fuck you!
I ain't gotta answer to you!

Fuck you!

[Siren wailing, indistinct
chatter on police radio]

MAN: Hey, ?en! Gordon!
We need you over here now!

I'll be back.

WOMAN: Harassing us again.
Get out of our neighborhood!

I want you to go out that back door
and don't come back.

[Sirens wailing]

Iris, Iris, come here.

-Police! Police! Open the door!
-It's gonna be okay.

-Let's get this over with.
-Police!

Police, open up!

[Shotgun cocking]

Open up!

[Thudding on door]
Stand back!

You stay close to me,
you don't say a word.

Police! Open up!

[All shouting]

Get down, baby, shh.

[Shouting continues]
Get down! Get down!

Get your hands in the air, now!

Shh, shh, it's okay.

Get down on the ground now!

[Handcuffs click, Marcus groans]

Ohh! Aah! Agh!

[Siren wailing in distance]

[Indistinct chatter on police radio]

[Tires screech]

[Gunshots, thud]


[Patricia crying]

-Job came up.
-Hmm.

It's a good job.

I was gonna tell you.

I told the guy if it came through,
I'd come back.

It came through.

Probably should have
told you before,

but I'd like it if you and Iris
could come with me.

We're never gonna
be happy here, are we?

I can't go with you.

I can't stay.

'Cause this is not the life
you want to live.

Because I want more.

For both of us.

But all you have to do
is call me, Pattie.

Whenever you're ready.

See you later.

What about your TV?

Keep it. It's yours.

You sure?

Why not?

Good-bye, Marcus.
