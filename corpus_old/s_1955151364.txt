<i> Don't listen to</i>
<i> the haters, norm.</i>

<i> You're a polar bear.</i>
<i> You got this.</i>

<i> I mean,</i>
<i> look at those paws.</i>

<i> You're an animal--</i>
<i> literally.</i>

<i> It's all-you-can-eat</i>
<i> seal buffet.</i>

<i> Go fill your plate.</i>

Read 'em
and weep, boys.

Cari-boo-yah!
Full house.

I'd bet antlers
he fails again.

Ah, he looks
hungry.

I'm giving ten-to-one odds
he catches the poor pinniped.

They say I can't hunt.

Huh?

Oy, phooey!
How can I be king
if I can't hunt?

Norm:
Ooh-ooh!

Uh-uh-uh!

This is
gonna hurt.

Oh!

That wasn't so bad.

Oy, that was bad.

They say he doesn't
have any focus.

Huh?
Hi, Elizabeth.

Hi.

Ugh!

Jeez, it's like
pure ice up here.

An accident waiting
to happen, you know?

I mean, somebody should really
do something about this, huh?

Ahem.
Lemmings.

Anyway, I really
should get goin' now.

I've got a seal to go
catch and eat and i--

anyway, I uh--
see ya, gotta go.

Bye now.
Catch ya later,
Elizabeth.

Babe, look!
A hunt!

This trip
is finally payin' off.

Any last words
before I eat you?

Oh, come on.
Don't say that.

You always know exactly
what to say to get to me.

Eat him. Eat him!

Yeah! Eat him.
Eat him!

You wanna know
why I'm not gonna
eat you?

You got a minute?
Well, maybe an hour.

It all started
when I turned 13.

Norm:
<i> In health class they told us</i>
<i> how our growl would change,</i>

<i> how we'd start getting</i>
<i> more fur on our bodies.</i>

<i> But they didn't say anything</i>
<i> about speaking to humans.</i>

I want one! I want one!
I want one! I want one!

Aren't they supposed to stay
50 yards away?

If this little brat
takes one more step,
I'm gonna pounce.

Keep it up, kid.

The only thing you're
gonna get is a mauling.

Can't ya see we're
wild animals here?

Did you just
talk to me?

Wait.
You can speak bear?

No, dummy, you're
speaking human.

Norm: I didn't
know what to do.

No other bear seemed to
be able to speak human.

And certainly
no other bear had these
weird feelings that I had.

So I went to go
see the wisest bear
in the world.

The king
of the arctic,

who conveniently
was also my grandpa.

Norm:
I don't know what to do.
I didn't ask for this.

What is wrong
with me?

Nothing is wrong
with you, norm.
You're special.

Yeah, a real
one of a kind.

Actually, more like
two of a kind.

I share the same trait.

I, too, can speak
to our human visitors.

You can talk
to them, too?

I can.

Polar bears are icons
of the arctic, norm.

And an icon with a voice
can be very powerful indeed.

Our land
is vulnerable

and we're
responsible.

For now, just know
that what you and I have

is a great gift.

One day you'll
truly understand.

But when
will I understand?

Norm:
<i> But if didn't end there.</i>

<i> Human tendencies</i>
<i> had taken over my body.</i>

<i> That's when I started doing</i>
<i> the arctic shake.</i>

Norm:
<i> I put the "soul"</i>
<i> in winter solstice.</i>

These days, I'm pretty glad
i have these feelings,

but I just don't know
what to do with them.

And that brings me
to the other day.

Why don't you
take a picture?
It'll last longer.

I knew he wouldn't
kill the seal.

Pay up.
Fine, here.

You're lucky
these things
grow back.

I'm a bear who can't hunt.
I'm soft and frozen yogurt.

Who needs a bear
with too much care

and not enough scare?

Norm!
What is that,
a haiku?

What did dad tell you
about writing poetry?

I know, I know.
"Leave the poetry
to the panda bears."

What's up, Sam?

I only caught
the tail end of it--

but I made some
money off your failed
hunt today, big bro.

I wish I'd caught
the tail end of my hunt.

Let me give you
some advice, bro.

Act with your stomach
and not your heart.

- Huh?

Oh, my 5:00 is here.
Excuse me, normie.

I don't know why you spend
so much time and energy

on these tourists.
They're ruining it up here.

<i> Au contraire,</i>
<i> mon frÃ¨re. </i>

As dad always said,
"if humans come to our
land and clap,

they can't come
to our land and crap."

"Give them a scene..."

"The arctic
stays clean."

Thanks, Stan, I got it.
But grandpa always said--

enough
about grandpa, norm.
He left us, remember?

He's not here.
We are.

The humans won't destroy
something they love.

And they love...

Us.

Let's give these
people what they came
a thousand miles to see.

A show!

And go!

Whoa!

You ain't seen
nothin' yet.

Whales, I need whales.

How many times
do I have to tell you?
This ain't Orlando.

Act real.

Oh, not that real.

Oh, that's
the fourth time
this month.

Norm, I need you
for the finale.

I'm desperate.
A whale just ate
my actor.

This is
my nightmare.

Oh, please.

No, the arctic shake was
for your bachelor party.

I'd never do that
for the human tourists.

Never, never, never.

He doesn't
belong in the arctic,
he belongs on Broadway.

Man:<i> Right?</i>

Man:
<i> Can you do</i>
<i> the Charleston?</i>

Socrates!
Oh, wisest of the winged.

Brainiest
of the beaked.

Norm, grab a seat.

Be with you in a minute.
Just finishing up.

Norm:
And the next thing
you know, I'm twerking

in front of a boatload
of human tourists.

Twerking!
Have some self-respect,
norm.

I just
don't know why
everyone wants to be

so nice to
these intruders.

They've never done
anything for us

except to come to
our land uninvited.

Ah, your grandfather
had a saying--

<i> "panem et circenses." </i>
"Bread and circuses."

He meant it's easier
to distract ourselves

with food
and entertainment,

than think about
the real problems.

What happened
to grandpa, socrates?

Did he really
just disappear?

The theories
are plentiful.

Some believe he is on
a vision quest.

Some people think he simply
went to search for fish.

While others think
he went to follow
the band...

Phish.

Me, I think
your grandpa knew
something was happening,

and tried
to fight it.

And it looks like that
something<i> is</i> happening.

Holy icicle.
Is that a human house?

It's a model home.

A sales tool.

Just arrived, literally,
fresh on the boat.

It means
more of these houses
are gonna be coming.

Humans are moving here?
To live?

It starts
with the tourists,

then someone says,
"i could do this year round."

It happened to my buddy,
Freddy the flamingo.

He was in Florida,
minding his own
business.

A couple
of tourists show up.

Next thing you know,
there are plastic
statues of Freddy

on everyone's lawn!

We gotta talk
to the king.

King:
<i> Norm, that house</i>
<i> has nothing to do</i>

with why
grandpa vanished.

Norm:
Dad, you're not listening,
there's more.

There's a human house
right here on grandpa's land.

<i> Humans are</i>
<i> moving here now.</i>

Ah, norm,
you always did have

such an imagination,
now, didn't you?

First with the poetry--
I swear it's true.

Socrates and I snuck in.
And look--

from Florida.

Norm, you are
not to go anywhere
near there.

Do you hear me?

Grandpa's land
is off limits.
Understood?

"Snuck in."

Norm, you shouldn't
go onto property

that doesn't
belong to you.
You should know better.

Besides,
I'm sure the house
you're referring to

is simply
a research hut.

<i> Look, son,</i>
<i> you wanna be king?</i>

A future king
isn't supposed to
get so emotional.

We hunt, we lead,
and we sleep.
Simple!

Now there
is plenty of ice
to go around.

Just stay away
from<i> there! </i>
Far away.

And for
the love of salmon,
no more talking human!

You got me?
Yes, dad.

Did you see that?
He wants to give away
the arctic.

That's it.
We're done.

Norm, it all points
to the same thing.

Humans are invading
our land.

And you are a polar bear
who can speak to humans.

You're the only one
who can do something
about this.

Socrates,
i can't even hunt.

Norm, your grandpa
once told me,

"norm's the only bear
that has the potential

to be king
of the arctic.

<i> He feels</i>
<i> the arctic's pain.</i>

And if he
feels it enough,

he'll stand
for us."

I can't even stand
for myself.

Elizabeth:
<i> Norm, don't</i>
<i> listen to them.</i>

They're just furry robots
sitting in their ice
cubicles

obeying the rules,

pretending nothing bad's
ever gonna happen.

But<i> you</i> can
change the rules.

You're seeing the future.
They're just living
in the past.

You can find
a new way.

Don't just dance
for the humans.

Fight for our home
instead.

Okay.
I won't let you down.

Socrates!
- Cranberries!

Surprise is
the number-one
cause of death

in the elderly,
you know.

We have to do
something.

I have to do
something.

Ah, number one
or number two?

We gotta take some--
man:<i> Action!</i>

Norm:<i> What the heck</i>
<i> is that? </i>
Caw.

That is proof
of why you should
stay in school.

First you're cutting class,
next you're dressing up
in a bear suit

<i> doing twirls</i>
<i> for a real estate commercial.</i>

The seals
would kill<i> him. </i>
Cut!

Who said that?

I'm the only one
who yells, "cut!"

I'm the director.

I'm not just going to be
a furry robot

sitting
in an ice cubicle.

We have to
point that director
in a new direction.

Oh, great.
A suit coming
to give me

creative notes
on my masterpiece!

Hmm.

But I'll need soldiers
on the ground.

Invisible soldiers.

Those little guys?
They'll get crushed.

Trust me,
they're indestructible.

Ayah, ayah, ah-ah-ah!

Norm: What's he doing?
He wants you to stomp
on him.

He wants to prove
how tough he is.

Could he sign
a release first?

I'm gonna get,
like, lemming juice
everywhere.

Do it.

Ow.
I killed him.

If I go down,
socrates, I'm taking
you down with me!

Wait for it.
Wait for it.

Ta-da!
You're invincible.

You guys got Springs
for bones.

Hmm.

Can you see this, honey?
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

It's beautiful, mom,
but what will it look like

when you and Mr. Greene
build all those houses there?

You're changing the arctic.
Change isn't always good.

Olympia,
if this campaign works,
and the houses sell,

<i> that means</i>
<i> great things for us.</i>

<i> But it really is</i>
<i> amazing up here.</i>

<i> Oh--!</i>

Olympia, I'll
call you right back.

Hi. Vera brightly,

head of marketing
for Mr. Greene.

The commercial
is a masterpiece!
I deserve an Oscar!

Wow, you
can't win an Oscar
for a commercial,

but as long as
it can sell condos,

we've done our job.

Ah. Can you
smell that?

The air
is so fresh here.

It's completely
unpolluted.

Caw! Whoa, whoa!

Holy Hitchcock!
That bird just pooped on me.

I think that's good luck,
isn't it?

Wagh-hh!

Who forgot to secure
the lights?

I swear
i secured them.

Wah-hh!

Caw!

Is that bird
aiming for us?

Oh, poop.

Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

Vera, we're fine.

I still have
the background lights.

Wait for it.
Wait for it.

Don't tell me those
were the background
lights.

Don't worry, Vera.

I've already shot
most of the commercial,

and it's on this reel.

We'll fix
the rest in post.

Anything can be
fixed in post.

In one of my movies,
i wrote the plot in post.

Uh excuse me,
Nigel.

Vera, a director
always delivers
and never quits.

There goes
the footage.

Agh!
I quit! I quit!

You can't quit.
We have a one-day
film permit,

and the house goes back
to New York tonight.

Au revoir,
as they say
in France

and some parts
of Canada!

Ah...

Good job today, lemmings,
but let's not get
too comfortable.

Yup, there's
one more down there.
Oh, sorry about that.

You guys gotta
speak up, seriously.

If you're gonna
go to the bottom,
tell somebody.

Let's not
completely relax

<i> until "pretty in pink"</i>
<i> heads back to America.</i>

Okay, Vera, you're
a problem solver.

When you're faced
with a problem,

what do you usually do?

You solve it!

If only I had some seals
and ice, and...

Are there
penguins up here?

Sea lion! Hi!
Please come back.

<i> I need your help</i>
<i> with this shot. Please?</i>

It's a seal,
you generalist.

Humans think all animals
look the same.

Ouch!
Cracked driveway.

Not a good selling point.

Hey, the arctic
comes as is.

Who said that?

Mommy.

Sorry, honey.
Mommy couldn't
call you back.

I was busy
putting out a fire.

The arctic is on fire?!

Wait, so you're
melting it now?

No, no, not real fires.
Everything is fine, sweetie.

I'm totally fine.

Whoa! Oh, no!

Move it, lady!

Oh, no.
A polar bear!

Really?
Oh, they're amazing.
<i> Ursus maritimus.</i>

I think he's charging me.
Is that bad?

Look it up
on the Internet.

It says, "when confronted
with a polar bear,

assert dominance
and stand your ground."

I don't think
it's working.

Let me call you back,
honey.

Mommy has an idea.
Love you.

<i> Tired of suburbia?</i>

Come to the arctic,
where every day is a safari
in the snow.

<i> All you need to do is step</i>
<i> outside your front door,</i>
<i> literally.</i>

Waterfront property
now available.

Hmm.

You're welcome.

Mr. Greene, we've had
some problems up here.

Oh, Vera, my dear-a,
there are no problems,

only messages
from the universe.

Om...

Say it with me, Vera.
Om...

Om...

Mr. Greene,
the director quit!

What!

I knew you shouldn't have
hired that overpaid,
pretentious--

okay, how are you
gonna fix this?

How are you gonna fix
your fault? Hmm?

Well, I've been filming
all day,

and I got some
really great footage
of a polar bear

that almost
attacked me.

You've been filming?
That is so cute.

I'm sure you think
you're a regular
scorsese.

All right,
i need something
people might actually

wanna watch.

Wait a tick.
I love it.

<i> I love it. I love it!</i>

<i> This bear is a star.</i>

"Safari
in the snow."

Genius of me.

This will definitely get me
approval from the polar council.

I can't believe it.

Oh, I'm gonna be so rich.

Condos, shopping malls,
Volvo dealerships.

Oh, god, you name it.
It's going to be Dubai on ice.

<i> Bell rings ) </i>

Bring the commercial
and the model back home
to New York

and I'll see you
tomorrow, maÃ±ana.

That means "morning,"
i think.

<i> Remember,</i>
<i> we have one week</i>
<i> to get this approved.</i>

Actually, Mr. Greene,
while I have you,

any word back
from your Alma mater,

the magister mundi
academy?

It's Olympia's dream
to go there,

but as you know,
it's impossible to get in

without an alumni
recommendation.

Yeah, but she ain't
gettin' in

until the condos get in.

I won't let you down,
i promise.

<i> Vera, scrap</i>
<i> the campaign.</i>

Greene:
We need a real
symbol of the arctic

who can talk
to these people

and convince
these morons
to buy my homes.

<i> Find an actor who looks</i>
<i> just like that bear.</i>

Let's use the arctic
to sell the arctic.

Boo-yah!

An actor that looks
just like that bear?

Oh, brother.

You heard them,
norm.

They want an actor
who can use the arctic

to sell the arctic.

If that actor
is you,

we can use the arctic
to<i> save</i> the arctic.

You need to go
to New York,

and stop these houses
from ever getting here.

I hear they have good pizza
in New York.

Come on.

Wow, what can a bear like me
do in a city like this?

Lemmings, I have a feeling
this journey

might not be as smooth
as we hoped.

Just got to remember
to stay-- oh--!

Grounded.

Whoa!

Olympia:
This place is
so amazing, mom.

Did you know
that their Latin
department is so good,

they single-handedly
resuscitated the language?

It's no longer dead.
Vera: Well, it's
a school for only

the gifted and talented
geniuses, like you.
It really is perfect.

But try not to fall
in love just yet, okay?

This is only a tour.

We still need
Mr. Greene's help and--

mom, you're putting
too much pressure
on yourself.

We don't need
Greene's help.

I can get in
on my own.

I know it.

Just have
fun in there,
sweetheart.

It's the most
amazing thing.

I gotta tell
all my seal buddies.

You press the lever,
the water goes up.

Ooh! Whoo!

Both:
Huh?

Um, oh, hey, guys.
Come on in.

Um, help yourself to some
fur balls in the fridge.

Another
talking bear?

We gotta tell
Mr. Greene.

Wait.
What do you mean,
"another talking bear"?

Oh!

Bring the
tranquilizer guns.
Over.

Yah!

Whoa!

Greene house company,
where art thou?

The king of the arctic
has come to greet you.

Well, it's not MacBeth,
but it's a job.

Okay, bad costume,
but he knows the way
to Greene.

Man:
There he is!

Come on, lemmings.

Hey! Hah-ha-hah!

Yes, I am the king
of the arctic,

and the king
is hungry!

Sustenance!

Hark! Seal,
hark, I say!

Hey, you!

Man: Huh?
Huh?

Mmm.

Hey!

There he is!
I think we can take him.

A real polar bear
always does his own stunts.

Come here and feel
my arctic wrath.

Jenga!

Jeez, they don't call
this place a "concrete
jungle" for nothing.

Whoa, yes!

Ya!

Hi-ya!

Yee-ee... ah!

It was just
a misunderstanding.

We thought you was
a<i> real</i> talking bear.

Thank you.
That's a fantastic
compliment.

Mad rats! Mad rats!

Yes! Run, cowards!

Get back here, lemmings!

So you're here for the
Greene homes audition?

"King of the arctic,"
i take it.

Yeah. Use the arctic
to sell the arctic.

It makes sense.

Well, you certainly look
the part of a bear.

That costume
is exquisite.

Just a little
something I threw
together.

Yes. I thought I had
this role locked up,

but now my bear suit
is ruined.

Oh, I'll never
get this one.

Look, when you were
attacking those men,

you really had me
convinced you were
a bear.

Yes, I<i> am </i>
a phenomenal actor,

but I can't
compete with you.

Such authenticity.

You even smell
like a polar bear.

Me, I smell
like macaroni
and sweet vermouth.

Now go and get
that part!

Woman:
Mr. Greene,
let me be frank.

Condos in the arctic
is a ludicrous idea.

Now, condos in the Bahamas,
that people can understand.

Until we can see public support,
we will not approve this.

Polar council, please.

I do this all
over the world.

I know where people want
to live before they do.

Our homes
are very deluxe,

and you
would love them,
councilwoman.

People aren't interested
in living in the arctic.

Know how I know?
Because that graph shows

you're currently
at a 3% approval
rating.

<i> Until that number</i>
<i> gets above 85%,</i>

not approved.

Hi, everyone.

Sign in and wait
over there, Travolta.

Hey, guys.
Toilet's right there.
Help yourselves.

Ugh!

Whatever.

Oh, yeah. Looks like we're
real close to approval, Vera.

Great work.
We need to get
to 85%,

and we're at what,
2.8?

Vera, where is my bear?

Mr. Greene, I've got
bear actors from Broadway

and the big screen
coming right now.

Well, I hope so.
Because if you fail,

<i> you can kiss</i>
<i> your daughter's chances</i>

<i> of getting into</i>
<i> my Alma mater goodbye.</i>

Know what else
you can kiss goodbye?
Yo' job!

'Cause I promise you,
it will vanish,

just like
those condos we built
in the Bermuda triangle.

Woman on intercom:
<i> Mr. Greene, I have the</i>
<i> investors on Skype for you.</i>

Oh, great.
The arctic condo
investors.

And no approval
for arctic condos!

Thank you all for coming.
Okay, we're looking for real.

Let me have it!

Okay, I'm not quite getting
"king of the arctic."

It's more like
"queen of the prom."

Bear, bear, bear, bear.

I need real.
I need something
to save my--

you, come with me.

Only if I can
bring my lemmings.

We're with
the same agency.

Cute.
And very marketable.
Bring 'em.

Mr. Greene, meet
norm of the north.

Hmm.

Yeah, he's pretty.

And I feel scared.
Ooh, ah.

But can Norma play
"king of the arctic"?

It's norm.

Help! Help!
I'm being mugged!

Just take the watch,
take my wallet.

Just don't touch
my ponytail.

That's where-- that's where
i keep all my powers.

Vera, Vera,
throw me my mace!
And my wet wipes!

Sorry, Mr. Greene.
I was just...
Keepin' it real.

You know, trying to
use the arctic to sell
the arctic, you know.

Norm is just
a consummate actor.
He certainly looks the part.

And he even brought
arctic lemmings.

Janet! The rats are back!
Call pest control,

because the fire department
doesn't show up on time!

Huh?

Om... gonna die.

Mr. Greene, you said
authentic sells,

and no one
does authentic better
than norm of the north.

Well, he's too
authentic.

I mean,
we need a bear
that is happy,

that makes people
feel warm and safe.

You know, fake!

You're fired, norm.
Get out of my office.
Om...

You want happy bear?
You got happy bear.

This is great.

Add three more dancers
and we got a boy band.

Norm,
i take it back.
You're hired.

Vera,
take our newest
star out to lunch.

Come on, norm.
We'll go to kozawa Sushi
just upstairs.

It's the freshest
fish in town.

Kozawa's pricey.

Uh, okay-- Vera,
can you come here
for a second?

Just no lobster, Kobe,
or tipping, okay?

By the way, norm, if
you like mixed drinks,

you must try the flat
and sparkling water.

Wow, that actor
actually smells like a bear.

I haven't smelled anything
that foul since--

wait a minute.

Has he spoken again?

Uh, nope.

Something felt a little
too real with that bear.

The only thing
that looks like a bear,
sounds like a bear,

and smells as bad
as a bear is a bear.

I knew it!

You think
you're real slick,
don't you, old bear?

You thought
you could send one
of your bear operatives

to take me out?

Well, I got news
for you, gramps.

No way I'm goin'
down that easy.

Norm of the north
is finished.

I've got a bear assassin
to get rid of.

Norm?

He's an actor.
Never takes off his costume.

Huh?

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

I usually sit on the
ground at home anyway.

Um... for an entrÃ©e,
you want to do chef's choice.

He can always read
what his guests want.

Sure.

This should be
interesting.

Sorry we couldn't
bring the lemmings.

A little
health code thing.

Do you think
they're okay down in
the office by themselves?

Uh, I needed this.
You have no idea.

This day has been
something else.

Both the bridge
and the tunnel were
closed this morning

so traffic, was a nightmare,
and Tony was yellin' at me

like it was my fault
or something.

He's just mad
because he's short.

No offense.

So... Greene homes
up in the arctic?

Crazy, huh?

I'll take you to see
an exact mock-up of one.

It's actually a few floors
down from our offices.

You'll see, they practically
sell themselves.

If that's even
a good thing.

What's--
what's that?

Nothing, nothing.
Just, after having been up
in the arctic myself

and seeing how
beautiful it is,

I wonder if it's even good
to have houses up there.

That sounds silly,
doesn't it?

Not at all.

I know exactly
what you mean.

Oh, I gotta take this.
It's my daughter.

Hi, Olympia.
How did the tour go?

Are you loving
the new school?

Well, it was just a tour,
but I'm happy you love it.

I'll talk to Mr. Greene
again and--

no. Okay, honey.
I have to go.

See you tonight.
Love you.

A lot goin' on?
Yeah, sorry about that.

Olympia is,
well, brilliant,

but it's-- it's complicated.
Good schools are important.

Yes. Really, really,
really important.

Mmm.

Oh, thanks, chef kozawa.
That certainly looks<i> fresh.</i>

- Do you want to play rough?

Okay.

Don't worry patrons,
it's just a tranquilizer gun.

It's only sometimes
lethal on humans.

I don't know who sent you,
but the party's over, pal.

Mr. Greene,
what are you doing?

You smell like
a wild animal, norm.

Mr. Greene,
just because I haven't bathed,
you're gonna shoot me?

Jeez, I heard new yorkers
could be hostile, but this
is a little much.

I'm warning you!

Ah, is there
a sharp pain

in everyone's
bottom?

<i> Or is it just me?</i>

I'm feeling it.

Norm-San,
you are my guest
anytime.

-<i> Arigato. </i>
-<i> Do itashi,</i> bro.

Norm of the north, everyone.

Greene:
<i> Where am I?</i>
<i> What happened?</i>

Somebody shoot
that bear!

Mr. Greene,
please relax.

I think you might
want to see this.

Man:<i> And in other news... </i>
The local news caught
your outburst

at kozawa's today
and norm's heroism.

Everyone's talking
about norm,

and look at
our approval ratings.

Hah! Oh, my goodness.
We are rising faster
than the oceans.

Norm, uh, buddy. I--

I thought he was
a real bear.

I mean, I was
confused because
he smells

just like
that other polar--

huh?

Vortex.
That storm brought

all the smells of winter
right to our doorsteps.

"Real bear," huh?

You know what?
Just forget the
whole thing.

Some guy from a cola
company approached me
at kozawa's.

Said they
needed a bear
for a holiday thing.

Because of me,
your ratings
just jumped 20%.

Imagine what I could do
for a real company.

Norm, wait.

If you let him
walk out that door,
we are back to square one.

Norm, norm, norm.
Um, I am so sorry
i shot at you.

Hug?

Awkward.

Well, normie has
to look for a new job
and a place to live.

Not all of us can afford
a fancy Greene condo,

which I hear is fully
furnished and uninhabited,

and I will probably
sleep in the park<i> alone.</i>

Norm, wait.

Vera, he can stay
in the model home.

Ah! I<i> am</i> brilliant!

Hmm.
Perfect.

So close to work,
no commute and so homey.

Right, lemmings?

Hey hey-hey-hey,
careful.

Those are
the finest leather
hides from Italy.

Are they housetrained?
Oh, definitely.

They've peed
in tons of houses.

Well, I guess
we'll settle in.

Okay, we'll work
on getting you out
on the campaign trail

for Greene homes.

Get some rest,
and there's a minibar
with some food in it.

I'll give you
a 3% discount.

Vera, you work
on settin' up the
marketing.

I'll take care
of the rest.

Okay, boys, we gotta
find grandpa,

stop these condos from gettin'
built and get home.

And on top of all that,
Mr. Greene is watching us,

so act natural.

Not that natural.

Okay--

okay, look--

okay, look, we need someone
to provide cover

while I go investigate
that shelf that smelled
like grandpa.

I think I know
just the guy.

Look, all
you have to do

is go up there
and pretend to be me.

The lemmings
will let you in.

There's plenty
of salmon in the minibar,
so help yourself.

Brilliant.
Thank you, kind bear.

We'll leave
the lights on for you.

Okay, it's just
like an iceberg--

an iceberg with hundreds of
witnesses to watch me climb.

Hmm.

I just got it.
That's our norm, huh?

I'll start booking talk shows
first thing in the morning.

Lemmings: Eh...?

I have councilwoman klubeck
ready for the call.

Janet, you're the best
at being the worst.

Knock next time.

Whatever.

You just woke me up,
so this better be good.

Sorry to wake you,
but I found an actor

who plays a polar bear
perfectly.

He even smells
like a bear.

The public will fall
for him for sure.

Smart.
They'll love him,

especially
all those extra tourists

we let in the arctic.
Just for you, Greene.

On that note,
the floor plans for
your condo in the Bahamas

are already on the way.

It's so gigantic it's bigger
than my ego.

And we got those deluxe
showerheads--

oh, it'll wash
that guilt right off.

I don't have any guilt.
You want 10 miles of ice,

we still have
five million more.

<i> Just get the people</i>
<i> behind this.</i>

I need that to push
this through.

Well done, Greene.
As usual.

Oh!

That smells
like my grandpa.

Okay, think.
If you were a
slightly creepy,

one-note villain,
where would you keep
stuff hidden?

Right.
This guy's got
security cameras everywhere.

I'll be too obvious.

You guys
go check it out first.

If grandpa's
actually in there,

tell him norm
has come to the rescue.

Ooh!

If you guys had bones,
I'd be worried about ya.

Voice on TV:
<i> ...Can't you see</i>
<i> I'm busy?</i>

Lemmings!
Is norm with you?

So he was down there?

Well, we need to
get him out right now.

Grandpa says
it'll blow my cover
if I break him out?

He wants me
to build an ark?

Oh, no, no.

He wants me
to focus on the arctic,
saving the arctic.

I got it.
It all makes sense.

I'll save the arctic first,
and then I'll save grandpa.

And then,
if I have time,
I'll build an ark.

Woman:<i> Makeup! </i>

Hey, norm.
Norm, this is
my daughter, Olympia.

Olympia,
this is the great actor
i was telling you about.

Great to
meet you, norm.

Quite a costume
you found yourself.

Yes, hi, Mr. Greene.
Sorry I didn't
pick up before.

Your mom is very good
at her job, Olympia.

You must be proud.
I know.

Sometimes
i wish she wasn't
so good at her job,

if it meant
she got to spend
more time with me.

Oh! You have lemmings.
Mm-hmm.

The smallest animals
in the arctic.

Can I?

They're very instinctive.
They know a good person.

Hmm, so let's see.

You're approximately
500 kilograms,

exact skull
and nose proportions.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I only weigh 194 pounds,

just like the average
American male.

Please, I know exactly
what you're doing, norm.

You're saving
the arctic, your home.

So I'm thinking,
maybe we can work together.

And you can
save<i> my</i> home
in the process.

He can't talk
like you and me.
I tell ya!

There's nothing to--

be honest.
What's your plan here?

Well, Mr. Greene
wants to use me
to sell the arctic,

and I'm gonna use
the arctic to save it.

Exactly.
You have to rally
the public

so that they love you,
wait for your moment

and turn them
against Greene.

<i> Use his own plan</i>
<i> to defeat him.</i>

But the key
is to make sure

you time your moment
just right,

when the public
loves you the most.

The approval rating!
I'll get it as high
as possible,

and then I'll strike.
Olympia, you really
are a genius.

My mom's not the only one
who studied marketing.

- So ladies and gentlemen,

we have an unusual
guest today who is here

to tell us about
his home, the arctic,

and how you can make it
your home, too.

Without further ado,
norm of the north!

Ooh!

Whoo!
So, norm,

you're here for
a very special mission.

Would you like to
tell us what it is?

I-- I, uh--

ladies and gentlemen,
i think our furry friend's
a little nervous.

Well, let's loosen him up

with a clip
of some of his most
recent heroics.

I'm warning you.

- You know, if we're
not helping each other,

I mean, what are
we here for, you know?

"What are we here for?"
We're here to sell condos!

Talk about
Greene homes!

Man:<i> What a jerk. </i>
Ahem.

Tamecia:
<i> What can I say?</i>
<i> Norm, the public loves you.</i>

Hey, tamecia.
What do you say we take
this party to a bigger stage?

Now?
Not yet.

Crowd:
Norm! Norm! Norm!

<i> 85%!</i>

Look at norm!
He's famous!

Norm's fame has
helped our cause,

but it isn't
enough, Greene.

I can't get this through
until norm publically says,

"norm of the north
supports Greene homes
in the arctic."

Make sure he does it
or you're done.

This is it, norm.
You did it.

The public loves you.
And you know what
that means?

You're right, Olympia.
It's time to save our homes.

How long can it take
to get into a costume?

I don't think
he liked the outfit.

Norm, can you
please come out?

I think I just did.

Okay, lemmings.
We got one shot at this.

It's showtime.
We do this, and then
we go get grandpa.

Yay, norm!

Ahem.
So someone somewhere
thought it was a good idea

to build in the arctic.

That someone
is our "friend,"
Mr. Greene.

I just wanted to let you
all know the truth

about what this would mean
for my home.

Recording:
<i> Norm of the north supports</i>

<i> Greene homes</i>
<i> in the arctic. </i>

Norm! Norm! Norm!

Norm, we did it.

I'm on with
my architect.

We're figuring out
where to put the first

arctic frozen yogurt shop.

Your announcement
has been reposted
a million times!

No,<i> your</i> announcement was
reposted a million times.

I had something
i needed to say.
Greene:<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

Four homes pre-sold,
and already built.

Mr. Greene, you can't
sell the homes yet.

We don't have approval
from the council.
It's illegal.

Aw, "I'm wittle vee-wa.
I'm scared of the po-weece."

Guess what, toots,
I'm above the law.

Welcome to
the cold, hard world
of big bid-ness.

You sound just like
the investors.

"Uh, duh, it has to be
done correctly, Greene,

with integrity."

Please, wake up
and smell the profits.

Not to mention that
after norm of the north's
announcement today,

approval is a guarantee.

Norm, come back!
Don't be a diva.

Ahem.

Vera, get my lawyer.

We're gonna
copyright that roar
and make it a ringtone.

Hey, it's
norm of the north!

You're the king!

I'm norm of the north,
king of nothing.

I came to save my home.
I ended up destroying it.

Norm, your
grandpa once told me,

"norm's the only bear
that has the potential

to be king
of the arctic."

Hey, norm. Norm.
Why don't you come
over for dinner?

I'd rather be alone
right now, Vera.

Please,
just leave me be.

Norm,
why are you so down?
You were great!

The campaign
was a success.

Everyone loves you.
Don't you get it, Vera?

Because of me,
Mr. Greene is gonna
destroy my home.

I think you're
taking this polar bear act
a little too far, norm.

Come on.
Olympia would love it
if you came over.

Olympia...?
Dinner with a genius?
Mmm, I'm in.

You wouldn't happen
to know where I can get
some ice water, huh?

You know, so I can
freshen up a little bit?
For dinner.

Ugh.
You okay?

Ah--!

Ah--!

It's humble,
but it's home.

You should see my place.
No furniture,

but I do
get year-round
air conditioning.

Olympia:
<i> Thanks, Mrs. soo.</i>

Mommy,
you're home early.

How was
school today?

Scintillating,
as usual.

Olympia's just
not really challenged
at her current school.

That's why magister mundi
will be so great.

All the students
are like Olympia.

I actually think
Olympia and myself
are a lot alike.

We're both special.
We have great gifts.

Two peas in a pod.

Besties.

Anyway, mommy,
i was researching
the effects

of human activity
in the arctic,

and the research
is irrefutable.

It will
destroy the arctic
and possibly

the rest of the earth
as we know it.

Olympia, Greene homes
will bring awareness
to the arctic.

Olympia, let's
you and I go hang out

on that
comfortable-looking sofa.

Mr. Greene:
<i> Vera, it's official.</i>
<i> Just got word.</i>

<i> The polar council</i>
<i> is a yes!</i>

Oh, okay.

<i> Make the</i>
<i> announcement tomorrow.</i>
<i> Time to go public.</i>

We're in.
We got approval.

Well, don't all
scream at once.

It's not over yet, norm.
You can still do something.

Shake it up.
Hit Mr. Greene
where it hurts--

his wallet.

Hmm.

Where do you think
the investors are
right now?

<i> Great job, everyone.</i>
<i> Great job.</i>

Amazing day.

Oh, thanks, guys!

I've got to get
Pablo and the investors
to uninvest in Greene.

Norm!

Hi, guys.

I'm sorry
for just dropping in
on you like this, but--

you're a real bear?
Uh-huh.

Who can speak?
Yeah, who would
have thought?

But I need to come clean
about who I really am

and what I'm
really doing here.

We know exactly
who you are.

You're norm
of the north.

I am Pablo, and this
is my investment group.

Pablo,
building in the arctic
will destroy my home.

That's where I live
but the polar council,

well, they are very
aware of the impact.

You mean<i> this</i> council?

On that note,
the floor plans for
your condo in the Bahamas

are already
on the way.

<i> And we got those deluxe</i>
<i> showerheads--</i>

oh, it'll wash
that guilt right off.

How did you
get this?

I had some very small
hairy associates

relieve Mr. Greene
of this flash drive.

You're corrupt!
You took our money
under false pretense,

and you're as fake
as that ponytail clip-on.

It doesn't matter
if I'm corrupt,

because a deal's a deal.
The first four homes
are built,

and once they land
in the arctic,

you're contractually
obligated to fund the rest.

If I know Greene,

he'll have the homes
transported tonight.

Yeah, and if i
know Mr. Greene,
he'll dispose of anything

that reminds him
of the arctic.

You promise to take care
of Vera and Olympia?

I never got a chance
to say goodbye.

Norm,
you have my word.

Now get me
out of this deal.

We need to get the homes
down to the river.

That old bear? No!

We need to get
rid of him before he
can cause any trouble.

Commence
"operation kill that bear."

Norm:
<i> Just as Pablo predicted.</i>

<i> And just like I predicted.</i>

I bet grandpa
is in that last one.

Whoa!

Ow!

Grandpa!

What now?

Norm!
Grandpa!

Everyone back home
thought you abandoned us,

but socrates and i
always knew that
something happened.

Oh, it's good
to see you.

You know, sometimes
when you stick up
to "the man,"

you get stuck with
a tranquilizer dart.

Were you able
to stop Greene?
Not yet.

The houses are
being transported
tonight.

If we can stop them,
maybe we can stop
this whole operation.

Then what the heck
are you doing<i> here?</i>

Norm, don't worry about me.
It's your time now.

Leave me. Go!
Save the arctic!
Save our homes.

You<i> are</i> the arctic,
grandpa.

Hmm. I must have
weakened them for you.

What do you say
we go save our home?

What?

The arctic rats?

What?

What do you mean the bear
broke out of the cage?

It's impossible.
He's like, 80.

It would have taken
two bears to--

<i> what?</i>
<i> That isn't norm!</i>

Get the chopper
and find two polar bears!

How long until
the ship leaves?

I don't care if they're
predicting a storm.

Leave now!

Norm: The houses are on
the way to the arctic!

We gotta get to them!

Where are we
headed?

Same place
where I came in.

Huh?

Norm:
<i> There they are!</i>

Get ready, grandpa.
There's our ride home.

Agh-hh!

Ow!

No!

Eh...?

Norm:
<i> If we don't get down there,</i>
<i> it's gonna be</i>

a long swim
to the arctic.

Oh-hh. Hey!

Just shoot
those bears.

Greene said to put them
out of their misery

and dump 'em
in the ocean.
Wait! Wait!

You guys think
we're bears?

You hear that,
grandpa?

Talking polar bears
in Manhattan?
Now, come on, guys.

Yeah, maybe our friend
the easter bunny's
around here, too.

Are you sure
they're bears?

<i> They sound</i>
<i> like humans to me.</i>

<i> I didn't sign up</i>
<i> to shoot real people. </i>

Hmm.

Norm, no matter
what happens,

just know that
I'm proud of you.

You've come
a long way.

You might think
you're not a hunter,
but you are.

<i> Your way of hunting</i>
<i> is just different</i>
<i> than everyone else.</i>

You're going to make
a great king one day.

I know it.

What's wrong?

We're gonna
get this, norm.

No, sorry.
It's not about that.

I-- I'm just worried.
In saving our own home,

I may have ruined
someone else's.

I'm just hoping
Vera and Olympia
will be okay.

Olympia's voice:
<i> It's beautiful, mom,</i>

<i> but what will it look like</i>
<i> when you and Mr. Greene</i>

<i> build all those</i>
<i> houses there?</i>

"Mr. Greene, I'm sorry,

but I cannot help you
destroy somebody's home

in order to build
houses no one needs.

I quit."

Okay, every office
around the world

is ready to feed this.
Are you sure, Pablo?

Yes.
Send it now.

Norm:
We have to dislodge
this barge

so we can flip
these houses.

These condos
must never reach
the arctic.

Buckle up, guys.
This could get bumpy.

We have to
do this, now.

It won't dislodge,
it's too rough.

The swells keep
pushing it back.

Welcome to the real
north shore!

See you
on the other side--
whichever one we get to.

But remember,
whatever happens,

a king always fights
for his home!

Come on, lemmings!

Grandpa's voice:
<i> A king always fights</i>
<i> for his home.</i>

Le--

lemmings! Grandpa!

Talk to me.

What the--
they never got there?

Then where are my condos?

The bottom of the ocean?

Is that
some kinda joke?

Two polar bears?

<i> "Greene homes</i>
<i> and polar council</i>
<i> under investigation</i>

for bribery charges?

<i> Beloved norm</i>
<i> helps reveal sham"?</i>

These condos
weren't for any
of you peasants anyway.

They were for the one percent.
The one percent!

Huh, would you look at that?
I'm late for yoga.

Namaste, everybody.

Janet?
Whatever.

<i> Janet!</i>

<i> Help me, you peasants!</i>
<i> Help me!</i>

<i> Don't you know</i>
<i> who I am? Huh?</i>

<i> Rats! They're crawling on me!</i>
<i> This is Italian!</i>

Look who's out
of hibernation.

Son.

Every time I see you,
you've fallen on your butt.

I march to the beat
of my own drum.
You know that.

When everyone else
stands, I sit.

<i> Ta-da!</i>

Lemmings!
You made it!

Where's grandpa?
Did he--?

We've searched
everywhere, norm.

No.

Norm, you saved
our home.

I'm sorry
i didn't realize
until now,

but we are
so proud of you.

The lemmings told us
what you've done.

You used your gift
and you risked your life

to protect ours.

And on behalf
of all of us...

Thank you.

Ahem.
Remember what
we discussed?

King:
<i> A new day dawns upon us.</i>

We need a leader who feels
for the arctic,

speaks for the arctic,
and always fights for our home.

<i> Norm, I crown you--</i>

now just a New York minute.

You can't do this
without me.

Grandpa!

They all said
you drowned.

I was 80% sure
you were gonna make it.

Now<i> that's</i> what I call
a grand entrance.

The tide took me
all the way
to Greenland,

but I hitched a ride
with an orca.

He said
he was coming back
to audition for Stan.

You need therapy.

I have an opening
tomorrow afternoon.
Book yourself in.

Son, please
continue.

Norm,
i crown you king.

That's my brother! Yeah!

If the clouds clear
and the barometric pressure

is just right--

wow.
I see magister mundi
is teaching you

all these fancy
new terms already.

I told you I could
do it on my own,
without Greene.

Aren't you liking it
without Mr. Greene
in your life, too?

Pablo seems like
a much better boss.

Well, norm gave me
a great recommendation.

Oh, my gosh!
I can see it.

I can finally
see it.

He even
looks like norm.
I miss him, mom.

Me, too.
But I know
he made it home.

I bet he has
his own family now.

Isn't it pretty?

Yeah. I wonder
if Vera and Olympia
can see this, too.

-<i> Whoa! </i>
-<i> They're beautiful!</i>

Norm:
<i> Wait for it. Wait for it...</i>

Yah!
Ta-da!
