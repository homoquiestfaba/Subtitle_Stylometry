[ENGINE STARTS UP]

I fled him down the
nights and down the days.

I fled him down the
arches of the years.

I fled him down the labyrinthine
ways of my own mind.

And in the mist of tears,
I hid from him,

and under running laughter.

[ENERGETIC POP MUSIC]

Come on Darcy!

Come on babe, let's go for it!
Go for it mom, go for it!

Is she hot or what?
For an older chick, I mean.

You talk too much.

What can I get for you?

So, what's up with the
advertising genius?

We got our first client last week.

Wonderful!
[GASPING]

Yeah, it's the biggest car
dealership in Cleveland.

They, they want a new approach.
Something that skews younger, so...

You waited all night to tell us this?
I'm sorry.

Ben, wonderful!

That's amazing.
That's amazing, you two kids...

I mean three kids.

Just coming all this way just to
party with the old folks. It's just...

Mom, are you okay?

I'm sorry, just, I think I do need
to go powder my nose after all.


You're the best. You're so lucky.

Got a good man, good...

couple of kids, and you
even still got your figure.

Oh, your figure is fine, Betty.
Bob certainly noticed.

My mother would say,
"Count your blessings, babe"

Oh, I do. I do.

You know that guy Beadie?
Over in New Hampshire?

He got another one.
A gay divorcee, like me.

What do you mean? The um...
Yeah.

The news anchor on channel eight?
You know, the really cute one?

He said it makes it an even dozen.

She was tortured.

I don't know what I'm talking about.

I'm drunk.
That's okay.

Go back to your family.
Okay, are you okay?

Yeah. I just need a little
more time by myself.

Alright, I'll see you later.
Mhmm.

Okay.

I was going to save
this until later, but...

Happy anniversary Mrs. Anderson.

Oh...
You're a Pisces.

Oh, my God, Bobby, they're beautiful!

They're beautiful, thank you.

Oh...

Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, cut it out.

Come on! What?
For later.

Mm.
Save it for later.

Oh...

Let me try them on.


There.

Now, how do they look?

They were made for you, hon.


Would you hold that?
Yes.

And we'd better get back in there.
They're gonna think we got a room.


Honestly speaking, I wouldn't mind.

[TAPPING GLASS WITH A SPOON]

Alright, la-uh, l-ladies and
germs, what we have here is

the best accountant
in our little company.


In the same vein...

Best damn accountant in the US of A!

And you want to know why?
You want to know why?

Because he's careful... Okay,
because he checks his work...

And look out IRS, because when
he has to, he covers his tracks.


Enjoy!
[APPLAUSE]

Thank you for this.

Hi. I just wanted to thank
everybody for coming tonight,

and um... just take a
minute of your time.

Uh, when Donnie and I decided
to have this party,

it was really as a way of saying
thank you to our parents.

For your love and support and for putting
up with us for the past 25 years.


Um, but really, to thank
them for their love

and their respect and their
devotion to each other.

Through hard work and a
little help from their kids...

and lots of love.

My parents have created something
very rare. A good marriage.


We love you guys.

Well, got the house to ourselves.
Heh, yes.

Mmm.
We do.


Hmm, am I gonna get lucky tonight?

Well, if you bring me some fizzy water...
Uh-huh.

To settle my stomach a little.
Mm.

You just might.

Oh, want you to be on top.
[LAUGHS] Well, we'll see.

[PEACEFUL MUSIC]

Here I come, ready or not!

Yeah, well hopefully we both will.

Hmm!
[WHISTLES]

Oh, thank you.

Oh, thank you.

[LAUGHING SOUND OUTSIDE]

[INDISTINCT SPEECH]

Bob...
Hmm? Mm.

Are you my bad, bad girl?

Oh, are you my naughty boy?

I am. I can't help it.

I'm powerless over my nature.

I hope you're not powerless
over the long list of honeydews

I have for year 26, Mr. Anderson.
Mm.


Come on over here,
you naughty little boy.

[FOLK MUSIC]

<i>â™ª ...tombstone every mile â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Count 'em all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There'd be a tombstone every mile â™ª</i>



Ahh.

That was terrific.

Good.

Happy anniversary
you naughty little boy.

Yay!

<i>â™ª ...with potatoes,
and you're headed down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Down the woods to
get to a Boston town â™ª</i>

Okay.

A 1955 double-dye wheat penny.

Robert Anderson's great white whale.

Christ.
Mhmm.

Is that uncirculated?
Hmm, no, but better than good.

I'd call it VG. I found it on
yesterday's pennies from heaven blog.

The guy who owns it has it listed for like,
I dunno, $15,000, which is ridiculous,

but I think I could get it for 9.

Let me buy it for you. Let me,
an anniversary present.

Like your fish earrings.
No...

No, no, no, no.
Yes!

Those fish earrings didn't cost $9,000.
No, I know, but I want to.

Oh, no...

It's not the, look, hm, look,
if I find it, then it's...

Then it's fate, it's karma.
I know, I know, but...

I just thought, you know, it's our
anniversary, and it's special...

But maybe.... going once,
going twice....

I'm sure that one day...

I will find one in my change.
Until then...

Yes, you enjoy the hunt.
Yes, I enjoy the hunt.

Okay. Alright.

[SIGHS]
[DOG BARKING]

Oh, great. They're home.
Oh, you're such a mom.

I know I am. I'm just
powerless over my nature.

Mm.


Does an accountant ever
eat a good breakfast?

Ooh, good shot Ma.

Ugh, don't say "Ma."
It sounds so ignorant.

Ma!

Ma Ray, Ma Barker, Ma Jug,
you went out last night Ma!

Okay.
Ew!

Ugh!
Always blame the woman!

Well, as James Jones says
in "from here to eternity,

"God dealt women all
the best the cards.

Right between the legs."
Sexist crap!

Daddy, I can't believe you said that!

Daddy, it sounds so ignorant!

Bad dad.
Stop it, stop it.

So when will you be back?
Eh, it depends on the traffic.

I have to drop in on the famous
Mr. Gaines before I leave.

You're not crazy about my secondary
career as a kingpin collector...


But I am the best
accountant in the firm.

Yeah, no conceit in our family.
No.

Don't forget to thank him
for the tasteful toilet seat.

Will do. Right after I ask him for a
corner office with an ocean view.

Oh, you're bad. You're bad. Goodbye.
Bye.

You take good care of my baby.
Oh, you bet I will, Ma.

Love you.
I love you.

Drive safe.
I will, I always do.

Don't miss your flight.

Bye!

Call me!

Bye sweetie.
Bye.

[MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC]

(VOICE ON TV) ...and although
police refuse to comment,

sources close to the investigation confirm
that elements of the crime suggest

that it was the work of the notorious
serial killer who calls himself "Beadie."

Yes, that's right Dave.

Marjorie Duvall moved here to the
picturesque town of South Gansett,

New Hampshire after her
divorce five years ago.

Co-workers reported her
missing last Wednesday

after she failed to show up for work.

Ms. Duvall's body was discovered
early this morning by a jogger

in this remote area of the abandoned
South Gansett railway station.

If this was, in fact the work
of the notorious serial killer,

police can soon expect to receive
Ms. Duvall's identification cards,

along with a taunting note
from Beadie in the mail.

About a dozen downtown businesses
were boarded up Wednesday,

and glass littered sidewalks
following two nights of protests

over the police shooting
of an unarmed black man.

There were few people on the
streets as the arch diocese

cancelled classes in two
inner-city Roman catholic schools.

Police urged curiosity seekers
to stay out of the...


(VOICE ON TV) And me and mine
have cleared a straight path for you.


Aim here.

For the center.

Oh, no. No.

Oh, come on.

Oh, ugh, oh, poop!


Oh!

Yes, he goes, but he
never really leaves.

Let's see here...

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]


[EERIE MUSIC]

Ow!


These are mine!
I was looking for these.

Male expiration.

Shit. Shit!

That makes an even dozen.

She was tortured.


Oh, my God.

Oh...

Fuck, fuck, fuck!



[PHONE RINGING]


[PHONE RINGS]

[ELECTRONIC BEEPS]

(VOICE FROM ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hi, this is Darcy.

And this is Bob. We're not able
to come to the phone right now,

but leave a message if you want to.

And if it's about collectible coins,
make sure you leave a message.

Remember, change comes from within!
[ELECTRONIC BEEP]

If that's you handsome, uh,

get your tight little buns over here.
My, my husband's out of town.

Ha-ha-ha, very funny.
I tried you before.

Uh, I-I-I was on the phone with Pets.

You know, she got home fine, and,
and Donnie did too. It's just, and she's...

Just going crazy over those,
uh, bridesmaid's dresses.

You okay?

Um, well, to quote the
famous Robert Anderson I'm...

upright and sniffing the air.
How did it go today?

Ah, well I picked up 17 lady
liberties at a good....

Uh... no, at a great price.

As for that idiot's taxes,
the less said the better.

Oh, dear.

Your voice sounds thick.
You haven't been crying have you?

Well, I just, you know...

After I talked with Pets, I just...
I started thinking about my, my sister.

You know, she was a year younger...

than Pets when she died.

Um...

Well honey, if I jump in the car and
turn around, I can be home in no time.

No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

I, after the day you've
put in, it's just a...

I'd be worried you'd fall
asleep behind the wheel.

Are you sure?

Yeah, I'm sure. In fact, um...

did I, um, since you're
in Vermont anyway,

Did I, did I mention that, uh,
estate sale in Rutland?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I checked
it online back at the motel.

Lot 75 steel pennies.

I mean... Look,

if you're okay and I can square it with
Gaines, do you mind if I stay another day?

More time for me and the pool boy.
[CHUCKLING]

Well, lock up tight.
Always.

I know you loved your sister, honey.

Yes. Yes, I did.

And I love you.
I love you.

[SCREAMING ON TV]


[EERIE MUSIC]


(VOICE ON TV)
Incredible as it may seem,

Beadie has been living on this suburban
Cleaves Mills street since the late 1980s,

with his wife of 25 years and two
children, who are just now finding out...

that they have grown up under the shadow
of New England's most notorious killer.

Or so they claim. Many are asking
how much Darcelene Anderson knew...

about her husband's
other life as Beadie.

She knew nothing!

Ask yourself if you really
need one of these tonight.

Yeah, well, I think tonight I do.

You just had had to
fucking look, didn't you?


Any more coffee darling?

Yeah, sure. Just a half a cup.

You know what,
forget about that coffee.

It'll just keep me up anyway.
Just the check please.

Comin' up.

A slut reading a slutty novel.

Hm.

[EERIE MUSIC]

No...

[DOG BARKING]

Hi.
[SCREAMS]

You've been cheating at the candy again.
Oh, my...

Jesus, you scared the life out of me.

As Moses said to the
children of Israel,

"what goeth in the mouth today,
is showeth in the butt tomorrow."

Bob...

What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Vermont.

We need to talk.
What?

You come sneaking in here at 3:30 in
the morning because we need to talk?

I lay for a while in
that stupid motel.

After we talked.

And then I went out for
something to eat,

all the while trying to
convince myself that...

what I was thinking wasn't true.

But I didn't get to where I
got by dodging the truth, so,

I jumped in the blazer
and I hit the road.

Really? Gosh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

I really, I just don't have a clue.
It's um, and as for the candy,

you know people in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones.

Well, there you go with your passive
aggressive stuff again. You never change.

I can read you like a book, honey.

You're upset.

And it's my fault.

And I'm sorry from the
bottom of my heart.

You found my secret hiding
place in the garage.

I really have n-absolutely no idea.
I don't know what you're talking about.

You did a great job putting
everything back where it belonged,

except the box was a little to the
left of where I usually put it.

And I love that box, because,
you know, Petra, Petra gave it to me.

And there was a rubber band missing.

Beadie always uses two rubber bands.

Belt and suspender rule.

But, I found it.

Under your car. Which, by the way, needs
an oil change, which you always forget.

Sometimes you can be so smart
about about some things.

And so dumb about others.

Like clearing the search history.

You always forget to do it.

What?
The search history.

It's the first thing I checked
when I came in. And...

Okay, I admit it.

I had a pudding cup. So I guess I am
a person that lives in a glass house.

Really, you checked my computer?
You dirty sneak!

Oh...

Darc, I've been doing it for years.

I have a very bad friend
that does very bad things,

and when you're a man
in that position...

You have to stay current
on those closest to you.

And since the kids left home,
that would be you.

And you haven't just been
checking on Marjorie Duvall.

You've been checking
on all of them. Whoops!


Who's... bad friend?
What.... what bad friend?

The kid I chummed around
in junior high with.

I told you about him
after we were married.

Yeah, but he's d...
Dead, yeah.

Got hit by a truck chasing a baseball
onto the street. Poor old Brian.

You're not making sense, Bob.

Ahh.

I guess you'd have to be there.

There were these girls that
snooted us in the 8th grade.

Diane Ramage.

Laurie Svensen.
And a couple of others.

Anyway, Brian came up with this idea
that we would catch one of them alone.

Well, maybe two. One for each of us.

We were going to say to them...

that if they fucked us real good like they
fucked their boyfriends on Saturday night,

we'd let them live.

And this was um...

This was all your
friend Brian's idea?

Well...

Look, those girls were snoots.

Like, like, like Betty next door.

Did you see the way that she was running
her tits all over me at the party?

Well, yeah, she was drunk.

Yeah.

But Darcy, you have
to realize that...

I didn't kill those women.

Not really.

It was another person inside my head.

I fought it for years, the voice.

And then I just...

I just thought, I'll do it, once.

Get it out of my head.
If I get caught, I get caught.

At least, at least it won't
be in my head anymore.

Won't have to think about it,
wonder what it would be like.

All these years,
you've been fighting him.

Is that right? The Beadie inside you?

Yeah, yeah. I have, and I
could fight him forever if,

if I thought that there
was a future for us.

If there was some way that
we could, you know, just...

turn the page.

Well, if I don't...

I suppose that I
become Beadie's next.

Oh, Darcy come on.

Honey, this is not some, some
movie where the psycho husband

chases the screaming
wife around the house.

I would never let Beadie hurt you.

You know that, don't you?

Anyway...

Even if you were to turn me in,

I wouldn't lift a finger.

But...

But?

You have to think about the kids.

And you have to think
about yourself, Darcy.

Honey, you have to
think about yourself!

Who is going to believe that you lived with
me for all these years and you didn't know?

Didn't even suspect.
I didn't...

I didn't, I didn't,
I didn't, not once.

You know, and then you
would have to move,

and the Anderson coin and collectable
company would be blackballed,

I can promise you that.

And, you know, then there's the kids.

They have to live with the
shame and the humiliation and...

Stop it, stop it, don't say that! Don't
talk about them when you talk about this!

Don't ever, just don't do it!
Okay, okay. Can we, can we, look...

Can we just put it behind us, honey?

Oh, God. I don't know.

Hm?
Okay.

Just let me think about it, Bob.

Let me think about it.
Sure, sure.

It's okay I, I... I understand.

I'm really tired.

It was a long drive.
It was exhausting.

Could you turn out
the light honey, huh?

Would you mind?

Stupid bitch!

Did you really think I was
going to let you live?

Did you really think I was
going to let you live, huh?

Did you really think that
I was gonna let you live?

Did you? Huh? Huh?

Bob?

Bob?

Bob?

[APPLIANCE HISSING]

[WATER DRIPPING]

(BOB, IN VOICEOVER) I didn't
kill those women. Not really.

It was another person inside my head.

Bob?

(BOB, IN VOICEOVER)
I just thought, I'll do it, once.

Get it out of my head.
If I get caught, I get caught.

At least I won't have to think
about it, wonder what it'd be like.

[IMPACT SOUND]
[GASPING]

[TENSE STRING MUSIC]

Darcy!

Darcy, I'm home!

Darc...

Pizza.

I didn't feel like cooking.

Yeah, but what about your acid reflux?
I took a zantac.

Okay.

Well, since we're gonna be bad, uh,
what do you say we have a little wine?

I'll take that as a yes.

I'll have another.


Wow, you took a couple
of zantacs didn't you?

That's the one you left
upstairs on the little table.

Did I? Hm.

Must've forgot that
I had it in my hand.

I was going to cut myself an apple,
but I, I forgot the apple too.

You know what it's like when you get tired.
You forget stuff. Hm, it's mushroom.

You have to promise me.
What?

You have to promise me
that you're going to stop.

Yes, honey, whatever you say.
The most solemn...

"Never go back on it" promise.

I do. I told you that yesterday.

And we could never
talk about this again.

I get that.

And you're not to send...

the Duvall woman's ID to the police.

I need more than promises, Bobby.
You dig a hole in the woods...

somewhere, and you bury
that woman's ID in it.

If I do that... Heh.

Are we good?

Of course we are.

You're good.
I am good.

You're going to stay that way, aren't you?
I am.

Mhmm. Good, that's settled.
Go ahead and eat your pizza then.

O-oh, my God!

That's hot!

Don't take such big bites and
you won't burn your mouth.

Mother knows best.


Mm, oh! Mm.

[WHISTLING IDLY]

[WHISTLING IDLY]

And mom, I'm still waiting on 20 RSVPs.
And, and they're all his relatives!

And he says that they're coming,
but how am I supposed to know that?

Why wouldn't they RSVP?
Relax honey. Take a deep breath.

The wedding is still
weeks away, okay?

Mom, I think it would've been
easier if we had just eloped.

Now that would've broken my heart.
And your dad's, of course.

How is the old fella?
Oh, you know dad.

He's upright and sniffing the air.

Hey, have you talked to Donnie? Are
you sure that he's cleared his schedule,

because, um, he's become this
damn success story and, just...

Pets, your brother will
be there with bells on.

And if he's not, your dad will...
Kill him? God, I hope so.

Something like that.

Alright, I love you mom.
I love you too.

And um, stop obsessing?
Alright, I'll try.

That's a plea.
Okay.

Thanks, mom.
Bye.

[GAME SHOW NOISE FROM THE TV]

Our champion, Sable.

Sable, and where are you from?

Sable's from Harlem!
Isn't that wonderful?

[MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC]

Any luck finding the
great lost penny?

No, not yet.

But you know, all good things
come to those who wait.

This is nice.
Yeah.

It's... How long has it been since
we've had a... a girl-girl afternoon?

Oh, I don't know, a couple of months?

I guess?
Mm.

That's right, because you
and Bob are so tight.

Yeah.
I don't know how you do it, Darc.

Honestly.
Yeah, neither do I.

Oh, he's on the road, yeah?
Uh, yeah, yeah. He's just in Portsmouth.

Um, some little stationary company got
their taxes all snarled up, you know,

and, and there's a coin show tomorrow and,
but, you know, he'll be back tomorrow.

Oh, with him, it's always a coin show.
I know, I know.

Does he actually have
any other hobbies?

Just let me clear these for you here.
No, I'm not finished.

That's, that's alright.
I'm not done!

Sorry.
Right.

Darc?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, you know it's just the wedding.
Petra keeps calling every night,

and every night there seems
to be a new problem and...

Shit just rolls downhill and...

That's it, that's it.
Yeah.

Exactly. And uh, you know I just...

I worry when Bob's on the road.
You know, when he's away.

How about dessert? Enough. [LAUGHS]

You're right Bob. I can do it.

(VOICE ON TV) ....friends have no knowledge
of the missing funds. In other news...

a Portsmouth woman was found murdered
in her apartment late this morning.

Mikaela Blake, age 42,
had been shot three times.

Police have taken Ms. Blake's
common-law husband into custody,

and sources close to the
investigation say he's confessed.

Of course, if the
next one is Beadie's,

she belongs to you, Darcy.


There's a fix-it muffler four
blocks down on Rayburn Avenue.

Maybe you missed it, huh? You only go
past it every day when you go to work.

Yeah, well, you know.

They fix the problem, charge you
three times what it's worth,

and then point out six other things.

And then, uh, some big snooty
guy looks at you and says...

"Hey, I'm just telling you,
it's your decision."

Can you hand me the
adjustable wrench?

Darcy?

You okay Darc?

Um...

I saw you looking at Betty.

Yeah, well... that skirt
was pretty short.

It's hard not to look.

Well then you're going to have
to try harder, aren't you?

It's a big week next week, huh?

Petra's big week.

You want to hand me the adjustable?
I want to get out of here.

Thank you honey.
You're welcome.

Honey, limo's here.
I'll be down in a couple of minutes!

I brought you some fizzy water.
Oh, thanks.

Oh, my God.
What? What's wrong?

You look gorgeous.
Oh...


No, no, no. None of that. I'm going to
have to fix my mouth all over again.

Hm?
[LAUGHS]

But... Thank you. Thank you.
You're very sweet.

So go on. I'll be down
in just a couple minutes.

[BELL TOLLING]


Daddy...

Congratulations.

Quick, get a picture.


Brian, get over here. Come here!
Donnie, alright!



Folks, ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for the father and daughter dance.

Let's get 'em out here. Let's see
them move, give them some room.

Hi, I, I'm just rehearsing my toast.
Oh.

[LAUGHING]
You'll be fine.

Honey, this is a beautiful wedding.
I'm so happy for you!

Thank you Betty. Thank you.

Um...

Bob...

I think he, he might have
a little thing for me.

Betty...

Yes, on a, a few occasions I have
suggested that he put his eyes...

back into his head. Okay.

I just want you to know that I have
never encouraged it and I never would.

Because you're my best friend.

I know that, honey.

You are such a peach. [GIGGLES]

I know.

You deserve every good thing
that's happened to you.

I'll see you later.
Okay.

Bob, what's wrong?
Nothing.

Nothing, everything is finally right.

Oh, honey...

If I was a poet,

I could tell you how grateful
I am for this second chance.

To be here, to see
all of this, but...

I'm just a lousy,
coin collecting accountant.

So all I can say is thank you.

Thank you so much.

Come on.

We need to get back in there.
Yeah.

[PEACEFUL PIANO MUSIC]

[WIND CHIMES]

Mrs. Moore? Mrs. Moore?

Are you alright?


Petra?
Darcy!

Darcy! Darcy!

Darcy.


Darcy! Darcy! Darcy!

What?
Darcy, you're never going to believe it?

What?
You're never going to believe it.

You're scaring the Jesus out of me, what?
Pick a hand.

What? I don't want to
play games, Bob, what...

Come on, come on, come on,
pick, pick, pick, pick!

You read my mind. But
you always could.


Found it in the change bear.

Y-you just found this? Let me see this.
I was just going through the change.

Oh, my gosh. How many years have
you been searching for this?

Since I was 14 years old.
Oh!

Isn't it great?
I know. I'm so happy for you.

So, what do you think? Is it fine
or very fine? You're the expert?

Eh, I'd love to say VF, but...
I know, I know, I know.

But it's better than VG.
Oh, definitely better than VG.

Definitely. You know what,
if your dad was here,

he would be cracking open a bottle
of champagne. I just know it.

Well, I will take care of that
tonight at pearl of the shore.

Oh, Bob. I, I don't know.

Come on, come on.
Put on your prettiest dress...

I will buy as much champagne
as you can drink.


Well, okay. How about as much
champagne as you can drink,

and I'll drive home?
It's your find, after all.

Deal.

Oh!

[SLOW SMOOTH JAZZ]

[BOB MUMBLING]

Woo!

Alright, one more time!

Whoa!
Yes!

Am I going to get to
be a naughty boy, huh?

Oh, you might, you might.


[BOB MUMBLING]

Come here, come here...

Oh, I'm going to go upstairs and
I'm going to get out of this dress.

And if you bring me some fizzy
water and a wedge of lime,

you just might get lucky mister.

But...

It will cost you.
How much?

For you? Just a penny.

Wait...

Mhmm.
Oh!


For safekeeping.

I want you on top, alright?
Yes. With the mirror. [GIGGLES]

Hey, now, hurry up,
hurry up, you naughty boy.


[SINGING IDLY]

Here I come, ready or not!

Are you my bad bad girl?
Are you my naughty boy?


[BOB GROANING]

W... Why did you push me?

Maybe it was female exploration.

I so hoped that the
fall would kill you.

I knew it might not.

Agh!


Yeah, here I am, Bobby!
Oh, I'm on top.

Just the way you like it, right?

Right?


[HEAVY BREATHING]

[TENSE MUSIC]

Okay. That's fine.

That's fine. That's fine. I'm fine.

9-1-1, what's your emergency?

Hello, this is Darcelene Anderson
calling from 24 Sugar Mill Lane.

My husband just fell down the stairs and
I just, I think I might, he might be dead.

Ma'am, I'm going to need you to go over
and check to see if he's breathing.

I already have help on the way.

For I am the resurrection
and the life.

And he who believeth
on me, even if he die,

yet shall he live.

So we commit thy servant,

Robert Anderson, to the ground.

In the sure belief that the
good works of his honest life

will recommend him to thee
on the day of judgment.

Hang in mom. Almost finished.

Would the family like to approach?

Rest in peace, pop.

Miss you, dad.

They were very special to me.

Then why didn't you
put them in the coffin?

I forgot, Pets. But, hush.

May the lord bless you and keep you.

May the lord raise up
his face upon you.

Nice dress. If it was any
shorter you could see her a...

Don't you, ever.

Ever!

She's just upset.
Boy, is she ever.

Do you think there's any booze
in that limo? I could use a drink.

Yeah, I'm buying.

Thank you so much
Mrs. Anderson. God bless you.

Mhmm, you too father.
You're very welcome.

Some good comes of
our greatest losses.

If you say so.

Hello.

Mrs. Anderson.

Yes. Can I help you?

Yeah, I...
Whoops.

Oh. Well, thank you.

Holt Ramsey. I'm with...

the office of the state's
Attorney General.

Does RET mean you're retired?

Heh, well, I'm an old dog. They toss
me a bone now and then, I chew on it.

Oh. I think I've seen you.

Have you been here before?
According to the Hindus, we all have.


Um, what can I do for you Mr. Ramsey?

Inside would be better.

Oh...

My, this is...

a lovely home you have
here missus. Look...

a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

My wife would have approved.

How I miss her.

Just the way I imagine
I miss your husband.

Yes. Um...

What may I do for you, Mr. Ramsey?
I'm sorry, or is it Detective Ramsey?

Heh, donkey ears since
anyone called me "detective."

No, you go straight to Holt.
That'll do me just fine.

But, the thing is, I get bored,
just the TV for company, so...

I thought to myself...

"I'll, what the hell, I'll take that
drive down to Cleaves Mills

and I'll just ask a few
of my little questions."

Here.

Have a look.

Turn it over.

Oh, I see you do know my name.
Indeed I do. Both your names.

Uh, Bob, Darcy. BD. Beadie.

Look at you. Look at you both.

Rubbing our noses in it the
whole time, weren't you?


There are twelve women
who are dead missus...

I'm surprised you can laugh at that.

Um, sit down right there,
and just be quiet.

Troublesome man.

Never touch that stuff.
You know you're crazy.

Could be.

But I noticed you haven't
asked me to leave yet.

I mean...

Agh, I probably don't have
much of a case, you know that.

Mm, you have no case.

Doesn't matter, missus.

There are ways, and there are ways.

Once I come upon this
fella, way far upstate.

Killed his wife, two kiddies.

Tried to make it look
like home invasion.

I chewed on that old bone.
Got a taste for it.

Chewed that bone 'til the
fella got nervous and he ran.

Mhmm? And what happened to him.

I chased him. Right up into the
Haynesville Woods. You know?

Where the song says there's
a tombstone every mile.

Well, he crashed. And I crashed right
after him, and that's how I got this leg,

not to mention this steel
rod that I got in my neck.

Mm, I can tell you when
it's going to rain.

And the kid that you were chasing?
What did he get?

He got death.

Burned to death in his car.

Saved the state... 40-50 years
room and board in Shawshank.

You are quite the hound of
heaven, aren't you Mr. Ramsey?

"I fled him down the
night and down the day."

"I fled him down the
arches and veers."

"I fled him down the
labyrinthine ways."

And so on.
Did you learn that in school?

Methodist youth fellowship.
Oh.

I won't let you ruin
my children's lives.

Well, if you think about it missus,

it wasn't me put ruin in their way.

You think about it.

[HORN BLARING]

[EERIE MUSIC]

Go ahead if you want to, but...

I don't think you'll get
away with it twice.

What's the worst thing
that you ever did?

Come on. It's just the two of us.

And you know what they say: Two can
keep a secret if one of them is dead.

And you'll be dead soon
enough, won't you?

Huh.

You recall that fella
I told you about?

The one who killed his wife and kids?
Mm.

Well, after he wrapped his
mustang around a tree, I...

I just sat and I
listened to the screams.

For quite a while.

Finally they stopped.

And then I called it in.

And who else knows?

Only you.

Because...

people wouldn't
understand, would they?

Tell me something...

Just what was it that you...

threw into the grave.

They were the earrings
that my husband...

gave me for my 25th anniversary.

They were fish earrings because
I was a Pisces, he said.

And they belonged
to Marjorie Duvall.

He raped her. And he murdered her.

And stole her earrings,
and gave them to me.

And I thought, "Oh, he's
just so thoughtful."

Marjorie Duvall's ID...

was, uh, in this box.

The box that his daughter
made him for a school project.

He promised to stop.

Did you believe him?

No.

But I needed time to,
uh, to think, and um...

I wanted to spare my children.

You didn't come here to kill me.

You never would've
brought this if you had.

There's one thing that
I can't quite get by.

The initials. B-D.

Beadie.

Beadie was something else.

When my husband was a boy,

he had a friend who
was killed in an accident.

It was a boy with... fantasies.

His name was Brian Delahanty.

I guess he didn't like his first
name very much, because...

when my husband was a kid,

he used to call him...
BD...

Would you have caught him?

Oh, yeah.

It's blurred,

like it's two pennies.

Yeah.

Some people are that way too.

I'll go now. And uh...

You'll do what you have to do.

Missus.

The only thing I have to do...

is pay my taxes.

It's not for me to punish you.

You know your kids are gonna...

talk about how much they
miss dear old... Dad.

And tell their grandkids about
what a fine fella grandpa was.

You're just going to sit there
and listen. Nod, smile...

once in a while,

even have to talk about
the good old days.

Mm.

I can live with that.

Darcy.

Come over here, close to me.

You did the right thing.

Now would you mind putting
my music on for me?
