WGTO-FM New York.

At 10 AM, it's 93 degrees,
and it's only gonna go up.

Be warned, New York,

the hottest day of the year
it is gonna be.

So stay cool and think hard
of that ocean breeze,

'cause you're not gonna get
any of that breeze.

What you're gonna get is hot,
humid, and stormy.

Take heed, New Yorkers,

from a man
who knows the condition,

the tempted condition
of man and woman

under the tropical latitudes:

Mr. C.C. Adcock
of Lafayette, Louisiana,

and his newly recorded song.

Hi.
Hey.

Sorry, I should've called.

Equations, equations, equations.

I thought you did anthropology?

I do,huh?

I haven't seen you in a while, I guess.

21 months.

My sister's graduation.
Right.

How are your parents?

Freaking out.

It's my SATs.

Heard you had
a lot of girlfriends.

Who told you that?

My sister.

Can I tell you something?

Yeah.

I'm still a virgin.

That's...interesting.

No, it's not.

It's not at all.

I want to do it.

With you.

Well...

do you agree?

What do you think?

I think that you should be thinking
about it a lot more.

I have. For years.

For years?

Do you know
what they used to say in Babylon?

That it wasn't done
for a man to reject a woman

who freely gave herself.

In Babylon?

Wasn't honorable.

And it was bad luck.

Okay, then, let's see.

Are you...

free on Saturday?

What about today?

<i>Oh, uh, no.</i>

Today's the perfect day.

What?

You think I don't mean it?

You think I couldn't
find somebody else today?

I would.

I'm not scared, you know.

Wait a second.

Take one.

Tie it.

You're into Kabbalah, Julie?

I'm not.
You're not?

No. I just--I thought it'd be nice.

Your turn.

The left. It's the receiving hand.

You don't have to keep it,
you know.

But you shouldn't cut it.

Oh, one last thing. Can I ask?

We put on a piece a music,

and we don't kiss until it's over.

And then what?

And then we do it.

All right.

Try again.

I'm not gonna do that.

I don't believe in it.

No, I think it's ridiculous.

That's her official title, psychic?

Does she have a degree in that?

Okay. So you've--yes--

you've gone to this woman yourself?

Cut, with your left hand.

Does it have to be my left?

It's a tradition.

It's a sacred tradition,
for lack of a better word.

Up to you
if you want to fuck with that.

Listen, I don't think
that I'm a good candidate for this.

I'm sort of skeptical.

When you're involved
with scientific research,

whether it's hard sciences

or social sciences or both--

You're free to leave if you want.

You have to understand,

we're not here
to deal with personalities.

Ego is the first thing
that goes out the window

as far as I'm concerned.

So, do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

Yeah, I'll stay.

Okay. Good.

Tell me
when they're not making sense.

You said you
were writing a book.

What's it about?

It's pretty technical
and theoretic.

What kind of theory?

It's a new equation.

It's a systemic equation.

Can we do without the cards?

You like to fight, don't you?

And conquer,
whatever that means.

Power, diplomas,
publicity, women.

You like to conquer
with your sword?

You saw that in the cards?

Let me tell you something
about the cards, okay?

The cards are here to help you.

They're here to stage
something in your imagination.

What I see,
I see without the cards.

Do you understand?

Do you know
why you came here today?

Curiosity.

Something else, more specific?

Something struck your sword?

Your power?

Is that what happened?

Are you into Kabbalah, Adam?

No, that's just a gift.

And curses?

Do you believe in curses?
I don't.

I can't.

Actually, I don't know,
I don't know.

Do you?

It depends.

You think you might, um...

know a way
to deal with that problem?

I might,

but it would involve you engaging

with a part of yourself
that you don't really know.

Are you willing to try?

Use this on your entire body.

I think your soul is feeling

trapped right now in your book.

You need to know
what your book really is about.

I do.

Anyway, that doesn't
have anything to do

with my private life.

Oh, God,
maybe I should see a priest.

Calm down. You're Jewish.

It doesn't work that way.

All right, that's enough.

Rinse.

Careful with these.

Only on your penis,
your testicles,

your scrotum,
and your anus.

Hold it.

If you believe
in the existence of the soul,

it's not so difficult
to believe in previous lives

and in the possibility

that two souls have met before.

Hold it.

Same souls, different bodies,
different incarnations.

And...

rinse.

God.

Everything is connected.

Your sexual predicament
is the connection

that led you to finding me.

Finding me again.

Now...close your eyes.

Now picture me
doing something sexual.

Not something mild,
something really sexual.

Good.

Was what you just
thought about

what I think you thought about?

Because
that was really creative.

Good morning.

You're early.

What's wrong with you guys?

Can't you
ever get your timing right?

I'm sorry.

Please, don't even start
getting polite on me, Diego.

I can't take it, not today.

Maybe you've
changed your mind.

It's okay.
It's okay to change your mind.

I'm fine with that.

What, you want
to run away on me?

Already?

All right, okay.

We don't have to do this.

You know, I don't think
it would ever work anyway,

not with the BC rules.

What's that?

Don't tell me you haven't
heard of booty call, Diego.

That's what this is, isn't it?

No strings attached,

no dating, no relationship?

Fuck buddies, okay?

Yes.

Yes to what it means,

or yes to the rules?

Both.

I don't think you could even
stick to the rules, Diego.

"Rule number one:
no meeting in public."

"Rule number two
no forward plans."

Right.

"Rule number three:

"no cuddling
and no pillow talk.

"Number four:
no sleeping over.

Get out before sunrise."

That's right.

"Rule number five:
not more than once a month."

Well, that one sucks.

Yeah.
All right, fuck the rules.

They were probably
made by men anyway.

Most rules are made by men.

You know what?

You're the only woman I know
who gets even more beautiful

when she gets more angry.

What you just said, Diego,

do you really mean that?

Yeah.

Well, what do--

What do you want to do now?

Don't even pretend
with me, Diego.

You know exactly
what we're gonna do.

There's something
I'd like to tell you.

Yeah?

I think...

I'm in love.

You are?
Yeah.

I mean, not with you.

Don't worry,
I know what you said.

Only booty, right?

Yeah.

And today,
it was really good booty.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Well, I don't know what to do,

'cause I've never talked to her.

You haven't talked to her.

What makes you think
it's really love?

I don't know.

I think about her a lot.

I wrote her a poem.
Can I read it to you?

Sure.

"Three times you raised
your eyes, my love."

"And what was free
and loose and lost in me

became your prisoner."

"I'll never need
to know your name, my love,

"or to know your story.

"Your name
is Joy, Grace, and Beauty,

"since that day,
that sacred moment

when three times you raised
your eyes, my love."

You think I should give it to her?

Well...

What makes you think
she feels the same about you?

It takes two to tango,
you know?

Well, she did
look at me three times.

That's it.

And where was that?

At the center
where I do capoeira.

She does yoga.

I don't--

Why do you think
she won't talk to me?

Maybe she's mute.

No.

Next time you see her,

bring her three blue roses

and a small lemon.

She'll talk to you.

Blue roses, not red?

And a small lemon? Why?

She'll talk to you,

and she'll be your lover.

Bring her three blue roses
and a small lemon.

She'll talk to you,
and she'll be your lover.

Is that for me,
or is that for you?

Why are you following me?

It's a very serious crime...

stalking.

No, wait, I didn't do stalking.

What exactly is it that you want?

Is it...me?

Yes.

I mean, not in a bad way.

Excuse me.

So what's your name?

Diego.

It used be Fidel back in Cuba.

You can sit down.
Thank you.

It was better to change it.

Listen, Fidel,

I'm not normal.

I can't make love normally.

Nobody does.

Yeah, but I can't have pleasure.

Not anymore.

I had surgery.

Heart surgery...

three times.

They turned me
into some kind of a freak.

You don't look like one.

I don't know what I look like.

I look like a big scar.

You know what I think?

I think scars are okay.

I think scars are good.

They show
you did something special.

I didn't.

The doctors did.

If you let me love you,

I'm pretty sure I can help.

There are many ways.

There's capoiera.
I do capoiera.

I don't know why,

but I feel like I could
be naked in front of you.

Okay.

How are you feeling this week,
Laura?

I was okay until today,

but, um, then...

Why don't
you come around here?

I'll take a look at you.

Just stand right here for me.

You need a dynamic.

What?

Does it hurt?

Only if you're tense.

All right, let's give it a go.

Put you head forward
look at your toes.

Relax, relax.

Okay, just relax.

Yeah?

I'll stop, I'll stop.

Don't stop. I'll keep it down.

Next one not here yet?

Don't look at me like that.

We can't do this.

You being naked like this
means that I'm...

I'm molesting you, so...

How much do you know
about what is called transference?

What you think you feel for me

is not really what you feel.

What you feel are
projected redirected feelings

that you shouldn't
feel like feelings,

not real feelings.

They're feelings from your past

that you are transferencering--

transferen--transferencing...to me,

on me, onto me,

but not onto the real me,

onto some idea
that you have of me.

An interesting contradiction.

It's all about
the fluidity of sexual energy and...

and self-control.

Are you done?

I'm done.

"I, Laura Lee,

"fully aware of the concept of

trans...ference..."

"consent to engage..."

"in a sexual relationship

"with Dr. Matt Roberts

on June 1, 2009."

All right, you can't
control me with a piece of paper.

Damn, you are manipulative
in a really weird way.

You can
really be quite perverse.

Maybe I am.

But at least I'm in touch

with my instincts
and my impulses.

And that's what they tell me--

that we do it right here.

But your instincts, your imp--

Right now!

Your impulses, they, um...

They play tricks on you.

Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

I'm really excited about going
to the Hamptons this weekend.

If you're free,
why don't we head down tonight?

I'm coming down to your part
of town right now.

All right, I'll see you soon.

Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

I'm looking forward
to the Hamptons this weekend.

Let me try to meet
you later for drinks.

Give me a call, tell me
where you're at, and, um...

Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

I'd love to meet for a drink later.

Morning, Kim.

It's Matt.

Hello.

Are we still on?

What are we on for?
What was it again?

Uh, Hamptons, Montauk.

I got the car.
I'm around the corner.

Come up, fourth floor.

All right.

Hi, guys.

Hi.

Hey.

You really want
to drive all that way?

Yeah.

It'll clear up.

Yeah.

Pretty wild stuff.

It was fun last night.
You should've come.

Yeah, well...

You missed something.

Is that you there?

So...

you're 93)'-

I don't think so.

I slept with you.

Did you sleep with her?

Sleep like sleep, or sleep like sex?

Come on.

She's a model.

She didn't have a place to stay.

What does that mean?

It doesn't count
if it's with a model?

It doesn't mean anything.

She's from Somalia,
and she speaks French,

pretty good French.

It means you're bisexual.

I'm not bisexual.

I just slept with that girl.

Come on.

Pack your bags.

So those other guys here, uh...

one of them was
your ex-boyfriend, wasn't he?

Yeah, Fabrizio. He's cool.

Do you still sleep with him?

He's got his own bed.

Anyway, he's too rough.

Hey, listen,

I'm not that easy, you know.

Okay, you've got yourself a girlfriend
for the weekend.

Wait.

What?

Fuck the Hamptons.

Okay.

Fuck the Hamptons.

So what exactly happened
last night?

Was that the first time?

What first time?
With that girl.

Was it the first time
you slept with her?

What about with other girls?

What do you think?

Why are you asking?

I'm just curious.

Really, curious?

Are you curious,
or you're jealous?

I'm curious.

So what?
How did it start?

Who made
the first move physically?

Was it you or...?

What was the first move?

Hey, please,

don't start getting
jealous and possessive on me.

It's not about being jealous.

It's about our true instincts.

There's nothing wrong
with having, uh,

boundaries and certain territories.

Oh, yeah.

They're also a part of our instincts.

Well, actually,
when you're acting,

of course, it's different.

It can even be interesting

how far you go,

how far you're allowed to go.

Yeah.

How far would you want to go

for a love scene?

Have you done any?

Nothing really bold, no.

Well, how far would you go'?

I don't know.

Would you go all the way
if they asked you to?

What kind of all the way?

Taking all my clothes off?

Would you?

It depends.

Would you go all the way
with another guy?

What if I did?

Of course I wouldn't
do it...darling.

Not unless they gave me
$10 million.

And then?

And then I'd be rich.

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy.

It is the green-ey'd monster,
which doth mock...

the meat it feeds on.

The Waverly, good morning.

Hi, Kim.

It is you, Kim, isn't it?

What can we do for you, sir?

Ah, good.

I only ask because, um,

it was someone else
last night and this morning.

Do you need
a wake-up call, Mr. Barron?

Yes, please, 6:30.

Very well, sir. Good night.

Wait, listen.

Tomorrow is my last day here.

I need to see you.

I don't think so, Mr. Barron.

I tell you what,

give me sixty seconds, okay?

Just one minute.

Your one minute turned
into 100 the other night.

Yes, well,
we were doing your lines.

Shakespeare counts triple.

I, uh...

bought a copy of the play

if you want to do it again.

Are you still there?

Yeah.

Ah, good,
now imagine if you will

your faithful insomniac
in his lonely pajamas,

slipping into the lean, mean,
infamous skin of Macbeth.

What, uh...
What's the scene number?

I'm not doing "Macbeth" anymore.

I'm doing "Othello."

I can do "Othello."

Well, thanks, Mr. Barron,
but you know,

I've got the switchboard
down here.

Oh, yes, the switchboard.

There is
something poetic about that.

Poetic? What's your definition?

Something with possibilities.

Anything with possibilities.

Anything? Wow.

Probabilities
are not so interesting,

and certainties
are not at all, but...

Well, it's like your call
in the morning,

the tone, the timbre,
the rhythm of your voice.

It has possibilities.

I'll set the automated call,
Mr. Barron.

You need a little bit of sleep.

Oh, no,
I won't be able to sleep.

I'll keep thinking that we
should've read Shakespeare.

Come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts,

unsex me here,

and fill me from the crown
to the toe topful

of direst cruelty.

Hold on one second.

Where were we at?

You don't to have to say yes,
just say maybe.

A possibility.

I don't do blind dates.

It wouldn't be a blind date.
You know plenty about me.

Including
how many girlfriends you have.

Don't forget, Mr. Barron,

this is a switchboard down here.

You should be
more careful, actually,

if you want to be senator one day.

Oh, no, I'll never be a senator.

I don't look the part.

Besides,
you have to be a perfect citizen

in order to be a senator,

or at least pretend
like you're one,

which is even worse.

So what do you think?
Will I see you tomorrow?

No.

I'll be at the Belcourt at 5:00.

I'll be wearing, uh...

I'll be wearing a hat.

And?

And maybe you'll come.

Kim?

Thank you.

I'm actually
very interested to know

about this all-female version
of "Othello"?

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

I'm Claire.

Julian.
It's nice to meet you, Claire.

Nice, nice.

Well, uh, have a nice drink.

I need to get going.

Maybe you shouldn't
have left your chaperon.

And maybe you would agree

to take your entrance scene
again from the top...

Claire?

Maybe.

How did you find out?

I recognized your voice.

Are you telling me the truth?

Why would I lie?

People lie all the time.

Especially about those things.

I'd lie to you
if I had good reason to.

Maybe you do.

I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

I just finished
the Phoenix speech.

I'm gonna need 36 hours
for the Boston one.

We just pulled up.

Are you sure
that your guy can find us

in the middle
of this fucking mess?

I guess he has.

I'm gonna walk.

I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman,
I'm gonna lose reception now.

I'll be back
in Washington tomorrow.

So you got more
of your conceptual shit.

It's so painfully trendy, Alice.

You should come to the sales.

I've got seats for Christie's,
you know.

You shouldn't grace
their dry little benches

with the moistness
of your magnificent pussy.

No dinner then?

Oh, this restaurant thing.

It's a fetish for snobs.

I don't get it.

Of course, you don't get it.

You're my only client
who doesn't act like a real man.

You don't have what it takes.

I do.

I'll show you.

Stop doing that.

Have we started?

We have.

You know we have.

This doesn't stay in the system?

Of course, it does.

I thought you were
giving me a discount.

Why should I?

I'm not a shoe shop.

You can still change your mind.

Take me to Starbucks,
and we'll call it quits.

You are allowed to flip-flop.

Liberals do it all the time.

I am not a liberal.

Don't even
think about that room.

Do it.

It doesn't stop you
from sleeping?

It's supposed to.

Julian?

What?

This was our last time.
I'm retiring.

What are you talking about?

You're too successful to retire.

You're the best.

Are you getting married?

No.

I'm opening a gallery.

Oh, Alice,

you're gonna make far less money.

You could actually lose money.

The art market
is incredibly unreliable.

No, this is ridiculous.

Why are you doing this to me?

To you?

You can't do this.

People count on you.
I count on you.

Oh, shit,
you're not taking this seriously.

I have signed the lease.

What about doing both?

I would have a PR problem.

You're gonna have a PR problem.

You can't keep this a secret.

I am not going to.

I'm gonna use this...

as PR, as my past.

I was thinking
about writing a book.

Maybe we can do it together.

Oh, fuck.

There is something else.

I want to have a child.

No.

I don't want a husband.

I wouldn't know
what to do with a husband.

I just want to raise a child
on my own,

and I'm looking
for a good genetic father.

And?

You.

Wow, Alice, that's...

That's really advanced societally.

No, that's really progressive.

You should think
about cloning yourself.

You could raise
little mistress triplets.

That's even more progressive.

I'm serious.

I think you'd be the best.

Why?

I'm short, I'm shortsighted,

I have allergies, um...

I like the way you write.

Can I ask you, um,

would you mind awfully
if I borrowed your goggles?

Mine have broken.

Thank you.

It's a bit hot.

Would you mind if I joined you?

Would you mind?

I'm really sorry.

Please, accept my apologies.

I'd feel really embarrassed
if you left.

Really embarrassed.

By the way, I'm Dominique.

Sean.

Nice to meet you, Sean.

Is it a good book?

Can you read me a bit?

Just, you know,

a sentence at random.

It works.

At random?

At random.

Okay.

Third line
from the top of page 99.

"When analytic thought, the knife,

"is applied to experience,

"something is always killed
in the process."

See? It works.

Yeah.

So, you just move
into the building?

No, I'm here for the weekend.

Yeah? Is it
your first time in New York?

What's your first impression?

Good.

Great.

Unpredictable.

Maybe it's not even the city.

Maybe we're all

less predictable in new places.

Routine is the enemy.

Come on, go for it.

<i>Relax. Lighten up</i>

I guess some routines aren't bad.

You know,
like swimming every day.

Or meditating like the Dalai Lama.

Not getting much better.

<i>We've got to change gear.</i>

Have you ever read
"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying"?

<i>Shit, it's getting worse.</i>

<i>What if I took
my swimming suit off?</i>

I mean, it's great.

<i>What the fuck
am I talking about?</i>

<i>I need to lighten up</i>

Or maybe not.

<i>Maybe she is interested.</i>

<i>No, I can't take it off</i>

<i>It'll freak him out.</i>

<i>I'll just change position.</i>

<i>Shit. She's doing stretches now.</i>

<i>She's getting bored.</i>

<i>Fuck, I think I'm getting hard.</i>

<i>I got to get out of here.</i>

Anyway, it was great
to meet you, Dominique.

I'll see you around.

Sean?

Was there a lot of blood?

It does that. It's okay.

He doesn't look worried.

It's just a cut.

So, it's Dominique, right?

Right. It's coming back?

Yeah. How long was I out?

Not long. How are you feeling?

Stupid.

Does it hurt?

No, not much.

It should, shouldn't it?

See? Your brain is coming back.

In fact,
you're a bit smarter than before.

Wait a minute,
so what happened?

You slipped.

I slipped?

Did you see me?

I was there.

Wait. You were there?

I was there.
Hey, don't do that.

I slipped?

Wait, did--

Did we go all the way?

Well, how was it?

Your father just arrived.

You know my father?

I found his number
in your phone,

and I called him.

How was it?

It was good.

Not bad at all.

Hold that cab!

Thank you.

You coming home with me?

They said it was okay
if I walked.

I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

I'll see you at home.

Okay, bye. I love you.

I love you too, Dad.

What are you listening to?

Don't worry about it.

Come on. What?

So what happened to you?

You disappeared.

I was actually at the hospital.

Had to get some stitches.

Show me.

Whoa, dude.

And they made
you stay there for three days?

Yeah, doing
scans or tests or whatever.

I mean, it's all fine, though.

What happened?

Anything interesting?

Tell me.

Nothing.
I slipped at the pool.

Okay.
Well, I got something to tell.

I'm not a virgin anymore.

I thought you didn't
want to do it with Jack.

I didn't.

It wasn't him.

Wow.
Yeah.

Does he know?

No.

You think I should tell him?

Unless you stay
very strictly abstinent.

So, what are you, like...

You in love with this new guy?

I thought I was, kind of.

But I'm not. It's weird.

Maybe you're ready
for something different.

You know,
maybe you ought to try with me.

You're kidding, right?

Sean.
No, I can't do it with you.

You're my best friend.

So'?

No, Sean.

Everybody knows you can't
do it with your best friend.

It fucks everything up.

Can you imagine you and me
in some horrible sex position?

Come on, Sean, stop.

No. It'd be
a really stupid thing to do.

Okay. It was just an idea.

I've been thinking
about what you said yesterday.

About what?

About you...

and me...

doing it together.

Listen, I'm sorry.

It was a dumb idea.

I was just sort of jerking around.

Well, I changed my mind.

I think you're right.

I think we should try.

No, you're the one that's right.

When you're friends,
it just fucks everything up.

No, listen,
I've been thinking about it.

It'd be your first time.

No, it wouldn't.
Yes, it would.

I know that it would.

What, did it happen
when you were at the hospital?

I think it's really cool to do it

with your best friend
for the first time.

It's the time you remember
for the rest of your life.

You don't want to remember me
for the rest of your life?

Stop it. I told you, okay?

It wouldn't be my first time.
Yeah, okay.

We can't do it, Julie.

It'd be too weird.

It'd be like...

It'd be like between
brother and sister.

Only we're not.

We're best friends, okay?

That's not the same
as being in love.

Yeah, but that's just the point.

If we were in love,
it would have to be serious.

It wouldn't
just be for the experience.

When you're not in love,
it's different.

It's cool.
