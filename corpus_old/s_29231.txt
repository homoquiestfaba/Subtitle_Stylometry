-What about the kid who rings the bell?
-What kid? What bell?

The kid. After the mine caves in,
he rings the bell to alert the town.

-Is that in the script?
-What if we gave the kid a disease?

-A disease?
-Braces on the leg, that sort of thing.

-But he runs.
-He could hobble.

A How Green Was My Valley thing.
Is that McDowall kid available?

-Too old. Plus, he’s English.
-So?

-The script’s set in Tennessee.
-Did I get that page?

Forget the disease. Nobody wants it.
It’s depressing.

-Boss is right. Who needs disease?
-It’s horrible.

-I hate disease.
-Box-office poison.

Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

What if we give the character--
What’s his name?

-Floyd.
-Terrible name. Change it.

-Say we give no-name a dog.
-A dog?

A dog. No-name’s faithful companion.

Toils at his master’s side
in the coal mine.

Cave-in happens,
only the dog gets out.

‘Cause dogs are smaller, usually.

And it’s the dog that runs
up the hill and rings the bell.

Holy crap, that’s beautiful.

-I’m choked up.
-I got goose bumps.

Lassie pictures always gross high.

Instead of a disease,
we give the kid a dog?

-There is no kid. The kid’s a dog.
-Could be just what the movie needs.

Let’s ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

Wow. That’s just...

...amazing.

Of course, it’s not
like the postcards say it is.

It’s not glamour everywhere you look.

I should know. I live here.

This is my town.

It seems like everyone here’s
from someplace else.

The reason? Movies.

Everybody loves the movies...

... which makes Hollywood
everybody’s town.

They come here by the busload.

The next show will be starting
in five minutes.

Please step up
to purchase your tickets....

Candy.

Treats.

-Bonbons.
-There you go.

For most, Grauman’s Chinese Theater...

...is the most exciting place
on the planet.

For me, it’s that and more.

It’s the theater playing
my first film credit.

No, not that one.

I wish.

No, I’m the B movie tonight.
Sand Pirates of the Sahara.

Not a bad picture, if I say so myself.

You gotta start somewhere.

God, I love seeing my name
on a poster.

Four years ago, in film land’s
darkest hour...

...the so-called Hollywood 10...

...testified before the House Committee
on Un-American Activities...

...investigating the Communist menace
in Hollywood.

Have you ever been a member
of the Communist Party?

Communism is not related to this.

Refusing to answer questions...

...the 10 writers dared
Congress to come after them.

After years of wrangling,
it’s time to pay the piper.

It’s off to jail.
The charge: contempt of Congress.

A new round of hearings
begins this fall.

The mandate: Get the Reds
out of Hollywood!

-Miss me?
-Every second.

That’s my girlfriend, Sandra Sinclair.
This is her town too.

She’s from Cleveland.
She came out here to be an actress.

And that’s what she’s doing.

The first picture
she ever appeared in...

... was the first picture I ever wrote.

The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

-Hands off, Khalid!
-Roland!

-You! I thought you were dead.
-You thought wrong.

-Let her go.
-I find your persistence tiresome.

I get that a lot.

Roland, look out!

This time I’ll make sure
you’re dead.

Taste my steel, you dog.

Taste my steel, you dog.

We were young, we were in love...

...and we were working
in the pictures. Life was good.

Louise, what gives?

They gave everyone the day off.

-What about my pages? Are they typed?
-Pages?

I’m on a deadline, I need my pages.

-Those men took them.
-What men? Those pages aren’t ready.

Pete, I’m not even supposed
to be talking to you.

They say you attended those meetings
while in college.

Who’s they?

Congress, FBI, Red Channels.
It doesn’t matter.

They know who they are,
that’s enough. Answer the question.

Meetings, meetings.
How the hell should I know?

It was a long time ago.
I went to college on the G.I. Bill.

The Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

They were Communists?
What do I know?

I couldn’t figure out
what they were saying.

-Why did you go, Peter?
-There was this girl.

You consorted with Communists
for a girl?

I went to poetry readings too.
That doesn’t make me Carl Sandburg.

Leo, you know me. I’m non-political.

Republicans, Democrats, Communists.
They all look alike to me.

As legal counsel for this studio...

...I strongly advise you
to watch what you say.

Leo, put your agent hat on.

-There must be an angle you can work.
-I’m out of angles.

We’re in the middle of negotiating
my new contract.

The studio suspended
negotiations this morning.

I’ve been blacklisted?
I’ve been goddamn blacklisted?

-There is no blacklist.
-Right. No blacklist.

Studio just doesn’t wanna know you
with this hanging over your head.

I can’t leave.
We’re shooting in three weeks.

Ashes to Ashes has been pulled.

-You believe it?
-I’m sorry, Peter.

So, what does this mean?
I have to testify?

Assuming they let you.

The least they can do
is let me defend myself.

The studio will lobby on your behalf.
That’s all I can promise you.

No guarantees.

-You up for testifying?
-What choice do I have?

They feed on names.
You’ll have to give them some.

I’m a writer.
I’ll make up names if I have to.

We’re talking about my career,
my life.

Christ, I’ll give them anything
they want.

Come on, toast with me.

To the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

Hey, Pete.
Think maybe you’ve had enough?

Tell me something, Jerry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

I wouldn’t know Hoover if he walked
in here wearing a dress.

Too bad. He says I’m a Communist.

In fact, at this very moment
some grey little FBI guy...

...in a grey little FBI suit...

...is hunched over my screenplay,
checking it, line by line...

...for the poisonous Marxist
propaganda which surely lurks therein.

Hope they check for spelling.

-I can always use help with that.
-You’re babbling.

Ashes to Ashes, my movie!

Could’ve been good.
Even with the stupid dog.

My Grapes of Wrath.

My shot at doing something
really good, something....

Something.

-What’s it about?
-Pain, nobility.

The human condition.

Truth.

It was my chance to get out
of B movies and onto the A list.

Go home. Why don’t I call
that gal of yours, Sandy?

Can’t, she dumped me.

Don’t you worry about me.

Hey, I’m gonna give you
a little extra something...

...because you took a big chance
talking to me.

Pete, you’re not gonna drive
in this condition, are you?

I can’t take this constant nagging.
I’m leaving you, Jerry.

I’m leaving, and I’m taking
the monkey with me.

Hey, I got a "what if."

What if you and me
just drive up the coast...

...till the sun comes up
or the gas runs out?

We change our names,
start new lives...

...never come back.

Sound good?
Oh, you’re just saying that.

I’m talking to the monkey.

Oh, my God! Okay. Okay, come on.

It’s okay. It’ll be fine.

It’s gonna be fine.
It’s gonna be fine.

It’s gonna be...

...fine. Oh, shit!

Come on. Come on!

We got it. We got it.

Jesus, no! God! Oh, God!

Come on. What the hell?! Let me out!

Help!

Teddy, what you got there? Hey, Teddy.
I Knock it off! Get out of there!

What in God’s name--?

What in the hell happened to you, son?

-I’m not exactly sure.
-You think you can sit up?

I could try.

Easy. Easy.

Easy. All right. Oh, my God.

Wait a minute.
Maybe you shouldn’t stand.

Do you wanna try it? Great God.

Lordy, lordy, lordy.

What in the hell--?

The town is a fair piece down there.

Do you wanna try walking?

-Okay.
-You sure?

All right, take it easy.
Now, just go slow.

Go slow, damn it.

Oh, easy. Easy. Here, here.

-Use that. I think it’s clean.
-Thank you.

You know, you seem an odd bit
familiar to me.

Do I know you?

I don’t know. Do you?

-It’s so quiet.
-Yeah, well, it’s early yet.

Most folks are just waking up.
It’s usually pretty quiet even then.

That’s Ernie Cole’s place.
He’s our druggist and mayor.

Lost two boys in the war.

Joe at Anzio and Willy at Bastogne.

-They were good boys, both of them.
-There’s so many.

All told, this town gave 62...

...of its young men to the war.

More than our share.
17 of them at Normandy alone.

Even got a letter from Roosevelt.

They commissioned this town
a war memorial.

Been in the basement of the town hall
for years now.

Folks never had the heart
to put it up.

Mabel over at that diner...

...her husband Max was killed
in action on Okinawa.

Say, son?
The woman does wonders with an egg.

-You hungry?
-Yes. Very.

Doc Stanton pops in every morning
on his way to the office.

Let’s have breakfast while we wait.

Morning, Mabel.

-My gosh.
-Doc been by yet?

He should be along any moment.
Has there been an accident?

I found him down by the wash. He was
lying there like a landed trout.

Who is he?

We’re still working on that.
The boy could use a meal.

Are those eggs spoken for?

-Harry, you mind?
-No, not at all. I can wait.

You trying to set a record?

-It’s good.
-Like you could tell.

-Have you ever been in here before?
-I’d remember these eggs.

-It’s just that you look sort of--
-Familiar? I said the same thing.

Hello, Stan. Mabel.
My bear claw ready to go?

There’s someone you should
say hello to.

Hello, son.

-How’d that happen?
-I have no idea.

Perhaps you better come along with me.
Let me take a closer look at you.

-On my tab?
-Of course.

Food was wonderful. Thank you.

My pleasure.

Come again.

Watch your step, son.

Follow my finger. Just with your eyes.

That’s it.

Muriel, call the sheriff.
Tell him we could use him.

-Yes, doctor.
-So? Doc?

What do you think?

-I think he looks strangely--
-Familiar?

-I’m getting that a lot lately.
-That’s what Mabel and I said.

-Vexing, isn’t it?
-Aside from vexing, how am I?

You took a pretty good knock
on the head.

Good news is, you’ll live.

Go ahead and put your shirt--

Better yet-- Excuse me, Stan.

Take one of mine.

Big, but it’s clean.

That’s very kind. Thank you.

-She’s very pretty.
-That’s my daughter, Adele.

My pride and joy.

Charms the fish right
out of the river, she does.

Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.

It’s just that your face
really does seem familiar.

Wish I could say the same thing.

Cecil! Cecil, listen to me.

Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack
right here?

-There’s a young man--
-I know, I’m here to investigate.

Anything interesting
will be in the paper--

Listen to me! It’s Luke.

You have no recollection
prior to waking up on our beach?

No idea who you are
or how you got here?

I remember a dog licking my face.

Before that...

...blank.

There’s someone who might be able
to shed light on this.

-Is it okay if I bring him in?
-Please.

It is you.

It is.

Oh, Luke. I never gave up hoping.

You’re alive! My boy! God!

My son.

Break it to her gently.

Sir?

-What did you say your name was?
-Harry.

Harry Trimble. And you’re Luke.

Everybody’s called you Luke
since you were a baby.

Where exactly are we going?

Where do you think, son?
I’m taking you home.

You fellas have a good rest
of the day.

-If you need anything, call me.
-Bless you, Cecil, for everything.

What are we doing here?

This is it.

"Hem Jesti."

The Majestic.

A few of the letters are missing.

We live in a movie theater?

No. In the apartment above it.

Harry?

How long have I been gone?

Nine and a half years.

Nine and a half years?

That was high school.

You ran 11 touchdowns that season.

My mother?

You remember?

Just a guess.

-She’s beautiful.
-Yes, she was, rest her soul.

I’m sorry. It’s so much to take in.

Me blathering away like a fool.

Why don’t I make some coffee?

Harry, why did you close The Majestic?

After the war, people here just
didn’t feel like going to the movies.

Some moved away. Los Angeles...

...Sacramento, San Francisco.

You still take cream, no sugar?

Luke?

Just us, son.

-How long have I been asleep?
-Since yesterday.

You slept through the night
and most of this morning.

I’d like to reintroduce you
to the staff of The Majestic.

-Irene Terwilliger, our candy lady.
-So glad to have you back, Luke.

He’s even more handsome now.

This is Emmett Smith,
our head usher and fix-it man.

Tell him about the watch.

One step at a time.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

Luke....

Fact is, we’ve been talking it over
while you slept, and....

Well, good news, son.

Now that you’re back,
we’ve decided to reopen.

Reopen?

How hard can it be?
We fix the place up, sell tickets.

Harry. Look around.

-It’s a dump.
-Told you so.

I am looking around,
and all I see is potential.

The place is ready to fall down. All
you’d have to do is give it a shove.

You’re wrong. You are. I know
she doesn’t look like much now...

...but once--
Once, this place was like a palace.

-Palace.
-That’s why we called her Majestic.

Any man, woman, child could buy
a ticket, walk in.

Here they’d be, here we’d be.
Yes, sir. Yes, ma’am. Enjoy the show.

In they’d come, entering a palace.
Like a dream. Like in heaven.

Maybe you had worries and problems,
but once you came in...

...they didn’t matter anymore.
And you know why?

Chaplin, that’s why.
And Keaton, and Lloyd.

Garbo, Gable, and Lombard.
And Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Cagney.

Fred and Ginger. They were gods!

And they lived up there.

That was Olympus.

We felt so lucky just to be here.

To have the privilege
of watching them.

This TV thing, why stay
home and watch a box?

Convenience? You don’t have
to dress up, you can sit there?

You call that entertainment?
Alone in your living room?

Where’s the other people?
Where’s the audience?

Where’s the magic?

I’ll tell you. In a place like this,
the magic is all around you.

The trick is to see it.

Luke...

...I think you loved The Majestic
even more than I did.

-You’ve got to remember that.
-I don’t.

It sounds crazy, but I promise
we can make this place like it was!

I don’t know how it was.
Don’t you get that?

-None of this means anything to me!
-It used to mean so much.

It doesn’t. How can it?
Harry, I don’t even know who I am.

No.

No.

Come with me.

Bobby Rilke. Red hair and freckles.

Always charging up and down the street
on his bike, screaming.

Scaring the crap out
of the old ladies.

Brad Hendersen.

Virgil Toynbee. And Patrick Vitger.
He was on the football team with you.

Stevie Wardlow.

His old man was a drinker,
used to beat him.

You’d bring him home,
we’d give him a hot meal.

Kid practically lived with us
for a few years.

He died on Saipan.
Silver Star for bravery.

Teddy Parker.

Jimmy Trask.

And this boy over here...

...bright kid. Honour student.

Joined up right after Pearl Harbor.

Parachuted into France on D-Day,
June 6th, 1944.

Three days later, his platoon
got pinned down by German artillery.

They were nearly wiped out. Most boys
dead or wounded, torn up by the shells.

But this fella here...

...carried the injured back
to safety, one by one.

Always going back till
all men were accounted for.

He never wavered. He just kept doing
what he had to do...

...until it got done.

He was reported missing
in action a month later.

His body was never found.

Congress gave him the Medal of Honor
for saving the lives of eight men...

...without thought to himself.

His name...

...was Albert Lucas Trimble.

We called him Luke. He was my son.

That’s who you are.

-Well, I’ll be!
-Morning, Ernie.

I heard about it, couldn’t believe it.
I had to come see for myself.

There he stands.
I still can’t believe it!

-It’s really him.
-I can see that!

My God, Luke, it sure is good
to see you again.

-Luke, this is Ernie Cole, our mayor.
-Mayor Cole.

You don’t have to go that far, son.
You can just call me Ernie.

-Care to join us at Mabel’s for lunch?
-I’d love it.

Good.

Oh, my God!

Watch your step.

-I missed you.
-Not as much as I missed you.

-Well? How did it go?
-Not so bad. I think I passed.

-That’s my girl! What about the....
-Hiccups? Not a trace, thank goodness.

Who wants an attorney who hiccups
when she’s nervous?

Like I always said, honey,
it’s all up here.

It’s so good to be home.

Dad, what is it?

-Oh, my God. Did somebody die?
-Well...

...somewhat the opposite, actually.

Look at you! Look at you!

Great to have you back, son!

Luke! Remember the time, you and me,
we were playing with firecrackers?

One of them went off too soon
and singed all the hair off my head?

No. What happened?

Well, all the hair
got singed off my head.

It was pretty funny.

You really don’t remember?

I’m sorry.

Heck, that’s okay. It’s good
to have you back, that’s all.

Ain’t that right, Bob?

Luke, you remember my cousin Bob?
You two joined up the same day.

Bob, nice to meet you.

Welcome back.

Thank you.

-More coffee?
-No, I’m fine.

-What are your plans?
-We’re gonna reopen The Majestic.

-Is that right?
-We were discussing it.

That’s the spirit, fellas!
We need a little more of that.

Where is Spencer Wyatt?

-Spence?
-Spencer!

-There he is.
-Come here.

-Hey, Luke.
-Hi, Spencer.

-Is your big band ready to play?
-Yes, sir.

What are you thinking?

This town has had a blessing of good
fortune after a long dry spell.

I’m thinking that we ought
to celebrate.

So, what do you say?
Saturday night, out at the point...

...a big welcome-home celebration
for Luke.

No, it’s too much.

Luke?

Adele?

I saw your picture.

Do you remember me?

No, but I’ll sure try.

-Adele?
-Yes?

It may just be my imagination...

...but I feel like we’re not alone.

Go about your business.
He’s not going anywhere.

It’s okay, folks. Go ahead home.
And thanks for the welcome.

You two have a lot
to catch up on, I expect.

I think we’d better--
Go on.

You handled that well.

Thanks.

So, where to?

Town hall?

Come on.

You first.

Why me?

In case the vicious guard dogs
haven’t been fed.

So you can be a gentleman
and help me down.

Careful.

There you go.

I got you.

Big, gloomy basement.

Nice.

It was a lot roomier before they put
the monument down here.

The gift from Roosevelt.
Stan Keller told me about it.

Your name’s on there.

So are the others.

I knew all these guys?

We both did.

We went to school with most of them.
You really don’t remember?

I’m sorry.

We used to sneak in here
when we were kids.

This was our secret place.

You, me, Stevie Wardlow...

...Tully Wentworth.

-That’s why you brought me here?
-It’s a stroll down memory lane.

Dad said if I took you places
we used to go...

...and showed you things only we knew
about, it might help you remember.

So we’re here for...

...purely medical reasons?

Not entirely.

I’m trying to make up my own mind
about you being Luke.

Join the club.

So, what do you think?

The jury’s still out.

Fair enough.

Any other secret places
I should know about?

-Really, it fueled my dream.
-That can’t be true.

I’m serious.

You’ll have to start making sense
sometime soon.

You wanted to be a lawyer because
of The Majestic?

We used to go
to the movies all the time.

Once, when I was 11, the movie playing
was The Life of Emile Zola.

About the Dreyfus affair.
Great picture.

You remember movies,
but you don’t remember your life?

Yeah.

-Weird, huh?
-It’s unbelievable.

In the movie, Zola stood up in court
and accused the French government...

...of forfeiting its honor
for wrongly accusing an innocent man.

Zola wasn’t a lawyer, of course,
but the way he spoke....

I decided right then
that’s what I wanted to be.

-Just from that?
-Just? Come on, it was great!

"In the presence of this tribunal,
the representative of human justice...

...before you, gentlemen of the jury,
before France, before the world...

...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent!

By all I’ve won, all I’ve written
to spread the spirit of France...

...I swear, Dreyfus is innocent."

"May all that melt away, may my name
perish if Dreyfus not be innocent."

"He is innocent."

It’s pretty good stuff, huh?

Not bad at all.

The sun’s going. Come on.

Watch your eyes.

-Is this another secret place?
-Our special one.

We used to come up here all the time
to watch the sunset.

And that’s what made it special?

This is also where we had
our first kiss.

We were 14.

That is special.

Wish I could remember that.

Me too.

We were in love, weren’t we?

Yeah.

-What was that?
-Nothing.

-I’m fine. Really.
-You don’t sound fine.

Just ignore it. It’s going away.

So were we gonna be married?

When you got back from overseas.

We were engaged
just before you shipped out.

Anything I can do
to help you with that?

Yeah. But it’s something
that only we knew about.

-Tell me.
-No. I think I’d rather die first.

Your father said any little thing
could jog my memory.

It still works.

-Found me.
-Sorry. I didn’t know who was here.

Just me and the dog.

-What’s his name?
-Dog.

-Simple. I like it.
-Come on in.

-Is that you? In the first World War?
-Yeah. 1917, thereabouts.

-It’s okay with you that I live here?
-Why wouldn’t it be?

Just checking.
Think I’ll get me a watch?

Right, the watch. What’s that for?

So I make sure the shows always start
on time. That’s important.

-I’ll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

I had me a nice watch once.

The pocket watch kind, with a chain.

Kept good time until it broke.

Never had the money to get it fixed.

By then, the theater closed down,
I didn’t think I needed it.

I put it away somewhere
for safekeeping.

But that was years ago...

...and I can’t remember where.

Lost me a medal for bravery once too,
back during the Great War.

Lost it in the hospital, I think.

I forget things sometimes...

...since the war.

Yeah...

...me too.

Trash. Vile, despicable trash.

It’s about the West Virginia
coal miners’ strike of 1920.

The plight of the downtrodden worker
and all that.

-Communist propaganda, start to end.
-That bad?

There’s a dog in it I like,
but aside from that....

-Tell me about Appleton.
-His agent reported him missing.

He’s been gone four or five days.

Four or five days? Gentlemen, we may
be onto something here.

What kind of man hides
after being implicated?

Not an innocent one. What if Appleton
is more than he seems?

Not just another schmuck, but an
important Communist operative.

One with lots of secrets to spill.

The Reds would do anything
to keep him out of our hands.

We have one of two scenarios here.

Number one: His Communist friends
killed him to shut him up.

Number two: They’re trying to get him
out of the country as we speak.

I don’t intend
to open a copy of Pravda...

...and see him get a hero’s welcome
in Red Square.

-What shall we tell Mr. Hoover?
-Tell him this has top priority.

You find him. Living or dead.

Whatever it takes.

His trail will lead us
to a nest of Communists...

...that will make the Rosenbergs look
like Ma and Pa Kettle.

Adele!

Got it!

Hi.

-Do I have a stain? What?
-Nothing.

Seeing you there gave me
a weird feeling.

-You wore that when we last went out.
-I could go change it.

-Don’t be silly. It still fits.
-You kids ready?

Shall we?

-Good evening.
-How are you?

-Hi.
-Good evening.

Smells good. I caught it from here.

Luke’s here!

Here he comes! Here he comes!

I’ll be right back.

Hey, buddy. We’ll take it from here.

I’ll get you for that.

I think Luke and Adele should lead
the first dance, don’t you?

Care to dance?

I think we’d better.

You’re pretty good.

Thanks.

You too.

When did you learn to dance?

That was nerve-racking.

I’d kill that Spencer kid,
except he’s really good.

-Looks like your investment paid off.
-Investment?

In high school,
you saved up for a clarinet.

You wanted to be Benny Goodman
in the worst way.

-And?
-You were Benny Goodman...

...in the worst way.

You gave the clarinet to Spencer.

He used to drive you crazy, following
you around like a lost puppy.

I gave him the clarinet. He started
practicing and left me alone.

-Did you remember that, or...?
-Just filling in the blanks.

Aren’t they a sight?

So they are, Harry.

Something wrong?

Something is troubling me.

What could trouble you
on a night like this?

Just look. Your daughter,
dancing with my son.

Everything the way it should be.
God’s in his heaven, Ben.

Still, I can’t help wondering,
where has Luke been all this time?

-I mean, 9 1/2 years!
-What’s it matter? He’s home now.

He went missing during the war, right?

So he must have been injured overseas,
lost his memory then.

So, what happened when he came back,
not knowing who he was?

Did he start a new life for himself?
Career?

What if Luke spent the last decade
actually thinking he’s somebody else?

I don’t care.
I care about his life here.

But don’t you see?
He might have people looking for him.

People who care about him.
Maybe even a wife and family.

You could be a grandfather
and not even know it.

I’m not trying to step on your joy.
My joy too.

But what happens
if his memory does come back?

Which life will he remember?

Which would he choose?

-So are you proud of your boy, Avery?
-What?

Oh, yeah!
I couldn’t be any more proud, Ernie.

I think Spencer’s got a big future
ahead of him. What do you say?

You know, folks, here in Lawson...

...we gave a lot to our country.
A lot.

And we never complained.

And we never faltered.

And we never forgot.

We never forgot.

And so, when one of our own...

...came back to us,
it was like a miracle.

Luke...

...seeing you walk down the street,
it was....

It was kind of like seeing one
of my own boys alive again.

I think I speak for all of us here
when I say...

...that not a day goes by...

...that we don’t keep
our boys’ memories alive.

But, Luke, having you back among us...

...that helps us keep
their spirits alive too.

God bless you, son. God bless you.

Now, on a lighter note...

...we’ve had a special request
from one of Lawson’s luminaries...

...Irene Terwilliger.
Irene, come up here.

There you are.

I’ve tutored music in this town...

...for more years than I care to say.

In fact, many of you here tonight have
been my students through the years.

And as talented as you all were...

...the most talented pupil
I ever taught...

...was Luke Trimble.

Luke, you played the piano
like an angel.

It would do my heart a world of good
to hear you play again.

Won’t you come up?

-Yes, come up!
-Come on!

Come.

-You never told me about the piano.
-Go. Anything could jog your memory.

That’s right.

I’m not sure I remember ever playing.

Music is in the soul, Luke.
Just put your fingers on the keys...

...and let it all come back to you.

Franz Liszt. Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

Like this. Follow me.

Now you.

Really, Luke! That’s no way
to treat Mr. Liszt. Stop that!

Stop it, I say!

Who taught you to play like that?
I demand to know!

Where did you learn
to play such a thing?

I taught him that!
When you weren’t looking.

-I think Spencer was loopy.
-No.

He was blowing some bad notes
there at the end.

Good night.

Good night.

Bob?

Bob Leffert.
You work for Mabel at the diner.

That’s who I am.
Question is, who are you?

-I’m not sure what you mean.
-I knew Luke Trimble.

I didn’t like him much.

Not saying he’s bad,
just rubbed me the wrong way.

You know the feeling? Someone rubs you
the wrong way, you can’t explain why?

You kind of rub me that way.
Not that that makes you Luke.

What I want to know is, what game
are you running? Who are you?

Just a guy
trying to figure things out.

This town’s had enough heartbreak.

Too much.

Me, I think you’re setting
everybody up for more.

I hope I’m wrong.

I haven’t had to kill anybody
since the war.

Why didn’t you dance with her?

Excuse me?

Mabel. Why didn’t you dance with her?

Seems to me, a pretty girl asks you
to dance and you say no...

...you came home more crippled
than you thought.

Hero.

Welcome home, Luke.

This was the first movie
we ever showed here.

Your mother loved it.
I bought the print.

Cost us our first month’s profits.

That was back in 1925.

Before sound.
You were just a little kid then.

Dad, I...

What?

That’s the first time you’ve called me
Dad since you’ve been back.

You know--

Harry.

Dad.

Wake up.

-What time is it?
-6:30.

I thought we’d get an early start.

Candy counter.

Display wiring needs help.

Should have stayed in bed.
