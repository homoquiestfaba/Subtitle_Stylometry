(potato chips crunching)

(crunching continues)

Um, yeah, as you know,
I'm a heavy drinker.

Yeah. Yeah, I heard.
But the Norwegians put me
to shame.

Yeah.
They said the food was good,
but I don't remember anything.

Well... (laughs)
But...

Mmm...
Anyway, we missed you.

Aw, man, I know.
But, uh, you know,

I gotta save my air miles,
and Oslo's fucking expensive,

everybody's getting
married in far-off places,

like, it's just--
and Annie wants to go
to Mexico this year, so...

I see how it is.
Soon, I'll be flying
to your wedding.

That's the idea.
Hey, baby.

Annie:
Hey, babe.
I'm talking to Chad.

Oh, fun!

Hey, Chad. How you doing?

Annie, I love your turban.
Thank you.
It's just for you.

How was that wedding
that you were at?

The wedding was beautiful.

A wonderful expression of love.
Mm...

And, uh, another one
bites the dust.

Aren't you coming
next week to Dinah's?

Mm-hm. Yeah, uh, Chad's
gonna crash with us, baby.

Oh, get out.
That's so fun.

Wait, I thought you
were gonna stay at the
little FIT girl's house?

The little anorexic one.
Nope.

We had a bit
of a falling out, let's say,

when she came
to visit me in Phnom Penh.
Mm...

Yeah. She's immature.
So...

Well, yeah, you're obviously
welcome here at all times.

Yeah.
We're just so boring.

We're gonna have a great time.
Yeah.

It's gonna be a good time.
Yeah, actually, I have
to get ready for work now,

but I guess I'll
see you next week.

Annie, great to see you.
Good to see you, Chad.

(Kabir laughs) Okay, man.
I'll-- I'll see you later.

I'll talk to you soon,
all right?

Kabir, thank you
for waking up early

to talk to me
over the Internet.

Ah, I've been up for an hour.
Annie: Kabir!

You left fucking crumbs
on the bed again!

Man on radio:
I would not have spent
New Year's Eve...

Chad:
You didn't hang up.

Oh, shit, Kabir, still?
(air mattress pump whirring)

Do you remember
that time after Dillo Day

he ate that whole baked ham?
With the dipping sauces!

Kabir: Yes, yes.

Yeah! And you were like,
"Who ate my ham?"

You did!
We were watching you!

Oh, that was so cute!

We have to put alarms
on the kitchen cabinets again.

Little baby locks.
Little baby locks.
I never-- that's--

Stop. I'm not baby locks.

Um, why don't we go out
and get a night cap?

I got to be
at the hospital, like, 9:00.

Look, I'm, like, eight hours
ahead right now, so I'm awake.

I mean, I have
to be up super early.
I would otherwise.

I met up with Berit
before I boarded the plane.
Oh, shit.

The hot 43-year-old?
Baby! Come on.

We had an interesting time.
Kabir:
Yeah, I know what that is.

We had three
interesting times.

That's our cue
to go to bed.
Yeah, we, uh...

We, like, need
a serious eight hours.

Oh, I heard
about people like that.

And that's a joke,
Annie, and I like you.

Um, can I get the keys?

What's your name?
Rachel.

What's your name?
Sh! Chad.

(Chad, Rachel moaning)

(air mattress pump whirring)

Kabir:
I know, I know, all right?

The hospital was crazy,
but I'll be five minutes.

It's fine. Don't worry. Just
the car is coming in 20 minutes.

So can you wake him up?
What? Chad, dude.

Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Dinah's wedding!

He can take his own car.
Dinah's wedding!
Fifteen minutes!

He can take his own car.
Kabir: He's not gonna
take his own car.

It's snowing!

Thank you so much,
Dinah's cousin. (coughs)

There.

It's Isabelle.

And no problem.

You want some, dude?
No.

Yeah. Yeah.

Annie:
Kabir! What are you doing?

Can we get out of here, please?

Hey.

Yo, I think we might
stay out a little while.

Yeah.
Um, can I get your keys?

Yeah, okay.
Annie: Kabir!

Okay.
Annie: It's really cold.

Thank you.
Bye!

Hurry home.

(both laugh)
So on which side
are you cousins? Of Dinah?

Isabelle: My mom.
I mean, the mom. Moms.

The mom. The mother.
Moms are sisters.
Sister-moms.

(Chad, Isabelle moaning)
Isabelle: Yeah.

(Kabir snores)

Isabelle:
Oh my god. Stop.

Looks like my flight's
been canceled.

(electric pump whirring)

Whoo!
Yeah!

Well, well, well!

Under-arm, please, Annie.

I have my own style, Chad.
Okay?

Chad:
Well, it's illegal
in this game.

I mean, are we keeping
track of rules? They're fine.

Chad: Kabi, this spring
do you wanna do the
Mont Blanc trail with me?

Whoo!
There you go!
Her style works.

Kabir:
Like, climbing a mountain?

It's not all climbing.
Sometimes you descend and--

you in?
Oh, yeah?

Uh, you know, we gotta--

We actually have
been planning the Mexico trip

for a whole year now, so...

Yeah, we're gonna
go to Mexico.

Yeah.

Nice!

Okay.

Mystery of the ages.

So... ta-da!
That's for you.

So is this, like,
some pickup-artist shit?

Uh, no, I don't do that.
I'm a proud asexual.

Huh.
Yeah, I just love magic.

Wow. I don't think
I've ever met an asexual.

You definitely have.
We're all over the place.

(phone chirps)
Very interesting.

Yeah. Psst!
Hold on one second.

Hi, Isabelle.
Here's some literature.

Isabelle: Hey, dude.
I'm not at home.
Thank you.

Can you come
to my friend's house?

Yeah, I'll come out there.

The Guy:
Dude, whatever you are making

smells fucking amazing, man.

Oh, thanks.
It's just root vegetables

in the pressure cooker.

That's just root vegetables?
That's it.

I'm making a soup.
Why don't you stick around?

I'm making more
than we could eat.
Oh, no, no.

Why? You totally should stay!

You should totally stay.
Stay. Why not?

Come on.
You have somewhere else to be?

Yeah, where do you have to be?
Stay. Totally stay.

Why not?
You must stay.

Okay, fuck it, dude!
I'll stay.

I'm making a chocolate
cardamom space cake

for dessert.
Delicious.

Is he inviting
this guy to dinner?

Yeah, I think it
sounds like that.

He's, like, a pot dealer.

Hey, baby?
Mm-hm?

What's up?
Are you happy?

Am I happy?
With us?

Yeah, I'm super happy.
Aren't you happy?

I'm really happy.
I love you.
I'm incredibly happy.

I love you.
What's this about?
I just--

I don't know, I just feel
like we don't go out anymore.

We haven't had sex
in, like, a month.

I've been trying.
You're always--

Look, things have been crazy,
okay, with work
and with your LSATs.

And, you know,
we've got a plan. That's...

All right. Well,
I just want you to know that

if you want to go
on the long trail

in Mont Blanc,
I want you to go.

I don't wanna go.
Okay, good.

I didn't want you to go anyway.
Of course not.

But if you want to go,
you can go.
We're going to Mexico.

I want to go
to Mexico with you.

Holy shit, dude.
That was fucking delicious.

Fucking delicious.
Thank you.

Who's ready for some
chocolate cardamom space cake?

Dude, I'm so stoned.
That would just put me to sleep.

Chad, I wanna vomit just so I
can taste your food again, man.


Yeah, that's a weird thing.
I'm gonna go there.

I said a weird thing.
That's okay.

I'm gonna leave this place.

Thank you so much. Isabelle,

please call me again.

I will.
Guys, nice to meet you.

See you guys!
All: Bye!

Annie, I'm assuming you're
a big "no" on the space cake.

You're psychic, Chad.
But, uh, Kabir?

No, man. I'm on call
tomorrow, so I can't.

Do you want just a puff?
No, because I'm on call, so...

You guys hear that Dinah's
family spent $60,000
on that wedding?

Yeah.
Chad: I think
that's disgusting.

$60,000?
Kabir:
Yeah.

That's insane.
That's a lot.

When I got married,
we just went to City Hall,

and then had a barbecue
in the park,

and it was only $400,
and it was awesome.

Wait, so you're currently
married, or you were married?

She's in an open marriage.
Present day.

She's in an open marriage.
Oh...

Don't even think about it.
Whoa. Don't.

You don't need to look at me.
You're smiling.

Well, you know, it's--
uh, it's interesting.

I think it's beautiful.
Annie: You would think
that's beautiful, Chad.

I would, and I do.

So, like, your husband
knows that you're here,

and he's fine?
Isabelle: Oh, yeah, yeah.

He's on the Coachella Cruise

with our really
good friend Chloe right now.

They're having a blast.

So, like, you don't ever

feel, like, a little jealous
or resentful?

You're making it negative.

Kabir: No, she's not--
I'm not jealous.

Annie: I'm entitled
to my own opinion, Chad.

Of course. Of course.
Negative opinion.

People ask a lot of questions,

and that's
totally valid and fair,

but it's really lovely.
We mostly just date our friends.

It's just like--
it's all love, you know?

That kind of thing.

I mean, you guys used to fuck,
and that's not a problem?
No.

Kabir: What?
No.

No?

What's she talking about?

Is she--
is she fucking serious?
(Chad clears throat)

(knock on door)

I'll get the door.

Kabir:
Wait, is she serious?

When? When did you
used to fuck?

Annie: Baby.
It was sophomore year,

and I thought someone
would have told you.
Annie: I honestly forgot.

Kabir: Someone didn't tell me.
Yeah.

Chad: I thought she
would have told you by now.

Hey, guys, I forgot
about the money... (laughs)

Oh, shit.
So, uh...

Sorry, man. Kabir,
I'll get you back for this.

What the--

(phone rings, buzzing,
speaks indiscernibly)

(computerized voice)
Fuck. Hello?

(woman on phone)
Dr. Kahn?
Yeah? Uh, yes? No.

Woman: Dr. Brenner's
trying to locate you.

Did you receive our page?
Well, y-- yeah.

Woman: Can we let him
know you're on your way?

Yeah, yeah, I am. Yes, yes.

Of course.
Woman: He said to let you
know that it's urgent.

Woman: Everything okay?

I was-- okay.

I'm, uh, on my way.
I'm on my way.

Woman:
Very good. We'll let him know.

Fuck!

Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

(door opens, closes)

Kabir:
Oh, shit.

(rock music plays)
