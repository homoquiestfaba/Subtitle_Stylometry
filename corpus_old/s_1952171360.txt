Unfortunately,
I can't make this delivery myself.

I have a reputation
with certain customs officials.

But I'll be along later in the week.

I don't think you'll have problems at all.
Not with Rasputin along.

The United States Government is trying
very hard to get its hand on these.

The most perfect plates ever created
for $100 bills.

I'm sorry, ma'am, they are not ready yet.

Mr. O'Hanlon, you promised me
the shoes would be ready by tonight.

I should have taken them
to a more reliable repairman.

That you should have, ma'am.
Because I'm not a shoe repairman.

I'm a cobbler, an expert craftsman,
that cannot be rushed in his work.

I came here because my granddaughter
insisted you needed the business.

I need nothing from the likes of you,
especially it being so close to Christmas.

Give me my shoes back.
Take them and be gone.

Come on, Lisa.

Wait, Grandma.

I can't hear. I can't hear anything.

No tricks tonight, Lisa.
What?

I can't hear you. Really.

All right. Let's have a look.

No wonder you couldn't hear anything.
You had a coin in your ear.

Go on with you.
And keep that money out of your ear.

Good night, Pat.
Good night, my darling.

A shoe repairman indeed.

What're you doing?

No, I'm not going in there.
No! I'm not getting in there.

Let's go.

It's a poor cobbler you're kidnapping.
Don't you know that?

Who's kidnapping?
All we want is your gold.

Gold? I haven't got any gold.

A friend of ours told us differently.
Who might that be?

Just hang on, my lad.
You'll be finding out soon enough.

That's not bad.
You ought to try out for The Gong Show.

What the...

He's disappeared.
He's gone. I don't believe it.

Where did he go?
How do I know?

United British Airways
flight number seven from New York...

is now arriving at gate number 22.

Passenger Richard Alexander...

Flight to Washington.

...Richard Alexander...

please report to New Continental Airlines
flight desk.

Last call for Trans European
flight number 10...

now boarding at gate number 16.

American International flight number four
from San Francisco...

is now arriving at gate number 31.

United British Airways flight number...

Your travels are over, Charlie.

Where are the plates?
They're on the dog.

In the vest.
But you are too late, Wonder Woman.

I can't believe some runt of an old man
got the best of you.

We can't believe it either, Mr. Bonelli.

He just disappeared.

The next time...

you better be more careful. Got that?

Listen, why don't we
forget about O'Hanlon?

He's just a poor old shoemaker anyway.

That poor old shoemaker
has got a hoard of gold somewhere.

And I need all the gold I can get
to buy those counterfeit plates.

$1,500,000 worth.

We've only got until Wednesday.

If we blow this deal with Thackery...

we'll all gonna be getting funerals
for Christmas.

Okay. So what do you want us
to do about it?

We hit O'Hanlon again.
And this time we make it good.

In two days...

I'm gonna be the guy dishing out
the funerals, and making people sweat.

No one's gonna stop me
from getting those plates.

Especially not some stupid old shoemaker.

Lisa, you gave me a fright.
You mustn't sneak up on me like that.

I'm sorry.

Is this a new game?

I've got to go away, darling.
There's some bad men who're after me.

Do they want your gold?

You're never to mention my gold again.
You hear me?

You had no business...

peeking in the basement of my shop
like you did.

It was a mistake
you ever found out about my gold.

I didn't mean to see it.
And I'm really sorry, Pat.

I want your solemn word
you'll never mention my gold again.

I promised before.
I won't tell anyone. Ever.

All right, fine. Now, be gone.
I've got work to do.

Hey, Pat...

I can't hear anything.
No, I have no time, Lisa.

Aren't you gonna check my ears?
Lisa, I don't have time.

Okay. Goodbye, Pat.

Lisa, darling.

Thackery pulled a switch on me, Steve.

I caught up with Courier, but not before
he got the plates on the plane.

What flight?
Global Air, Flight 183.

Arrives in Washington at 10:25 a. m.

183, we'll be there.

Yeah, there's one more thing, Steve.
The plates are on a dog.

On a...

A dog?

One of Thackery's attack dogs.

Easy, boy, easy now.

Seal off all the exits.

Mr. Bonelli, I presume?

That's right.
Welcome to Washington, Mr. Thackery.

This really is a nifty idea.

It doesn't do to be too far from
one's point of departure.

Good thinking. The boys and I have taken
accommodation just down the road.

Nice.

His Majesty's Light Horse Brigade.
I saw the movie.

Cannons to the right. Cannons to the left.

You collect these?

In a manner of speaking.

Only, when mine reach London
they won't be lead...

they'll be gold.

I get it.

You're gonna melt the gold down,
and pass it through as toy soldiers.

That's fantastic.

Mr. Bonelli...

they told me in London
that you weren't a really big operator.

You had no leverage, you couldn't handle
a really big job. True?

Let's wait and see how this operation
works out first. Okay, Mr. Thackery?

You want the gold and I want the plates.
It's that simple.

We're to meet Wednesday
for the exchange.

The quicker this business is over,
the better for me.

There is one thing, though.
I need another 24 hours.

It would make things a lot easier
if we can deliver it on Thursday.

Are you saying you don't have the gold?

No. I have access to it.

It's just that it'd make things easier
if I can deliver it on Thursday.

Mr. Bonelli,
as these gentlemen will attest...

I've gone to great risk
in coming to this country.

I didn't do so to be lied to
or trifled with.

You've got it all wrong, Mr. Thackery.
Everything's ready.

Wednesday, Mr. Bonelli.

Okay. You've got it. Wednesday.

Very good.

Hush and be done with you.
"Where're my shoes, Mr. O'Hanlon?

"Why aren't you working today,
Mr. O'Hanlon?

"An irresponsible old man,
that's what you are, Mr. O'Hanlon. "

I can't stand here
listening to that sound any longer.

I won't be caged up with that.

Going somewhere, Mr. O'Hanlon?

First, it's kidnapping.
Now it's breaking and entering, is it?

You'll be getting coal in your stockings
this Christmas.

Your gold, old man.

Send help here right away, please.

Like he said, the gold, old man.

Why do you think I've got any gold?

We hit a very prominent
gold exchange outfit.

And your name,
followed by several five-digit numbers...

was on their preferred-customers list.

You can't have my gold.
You'll have to take my life first.

Maxwell, take him in the back
and use the silencer.

And you, start tearing this place apart.

No, wait.

I'll take you to the gold.

No tricks, old man.

I'm not taking my eyes,
or this gun, off you...

till we see that gold.

No tricks. It's at my shop.
In the basement.

Jackpot. Okay, gentlemen, bring it up.

I never look a gift horse in the mouth,
old man.

That's why I'm not gonna ask you
how in the world you acquired all this.

Or why in the world you haven't spent it?

Let's go. Bring it up.

We'll take this upstairs
and wait for you, Mr. B.

Please. Can I get out of here now, too?

What's the matter, old man?
Don't you like my company?

It's the basement I don't like.

Dark and secluded places
never did sit well with me.

That's just too bad.

Because I don't know
what else I can do with you...

except leave you down here.

Please, Mr. Bonelli, don't do that.

Use your gun, anything,
but please don't lock me up.

I'm back.
You look beat.

I know. I am.

I'll never make a jet setter, Steve.

What's the latest on Thackery?

Immigration says he's
still in the country.

I've got something
that's gonna lead us to him.

Great. What is it?
Gold robberies...

about a dozen of them in the past month...

apparently done by
the same person or persons.

I get it.

Thackery never negotiates for currency,
only precious metals or jewels.

Whoever's been stealing the gold
plans to buy the counterfeit plates.

Find the gold thief,
chances are you'll find Thackery.

It sounds good on paper, Steve...

but do you think this person or persons
will try it again?

It's a long shot,
but we've arranged for a decoy.

A jewelry corporation is transferring
a small amount of gold...

this afternoon at 4:30.

Our people made sure
the news got on the grapevine.

Midland Security Transports.

What's a few more hours without sleep?

Thanks.
Welcome.

Have a good time.
I will.

Yeah, that's right. Like I said before
I want no foul-ups on your end.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah. We got it.

They're working a run as scheduled.

You got the uniforms?
Yeah. But why the extra job?

I thought all we needed to pay Thackery
was the Irishman's gold.

Deal with Thackery,
you've gotta be adaptable.

Raucher, you ready?
It'll be as good as the real thing, Mr. B.

Figure it out for yourself, Maxwell.

In two weeks, tonight's gold
won't be worth what it was yesterday.

I don't get it.

Thackery's discounting our gold.

You two guys get the doors, let's go.

As soon as you finish with that,
you better get changed.

You guys have got less than an hour.
Pick it up.

Just can't get over it.
What's that?

A woman being an agent with the AIDC.
It's the IADC.

What? You don't approve?
Sure.

It's just gonna take some time
to get used to it.

Don't take too much time, Gino.
Why not?

You might get replaced. By a woman.

That's one of our trucks. We better stop.

You have problem here?
You do.

Hold it, sweetheart. Come on out.

Right back there. Move.

Open the door.

Let's go.

Now get in.

Okay, let's go.

You're gonna do exactly as we say...

or your family's gonna have
a very unmerry Christmas this year.

Thieves! They're stealing the gold!
Stop them!

Halt!

Come on!

Now, back up.

Move it!

Come back.

He won't get out of the way.
Run him down.

Are you all right?
What did you do that for?

I just saved your life.
You let them get away is what you did.

Interfering women.

Thank you very much, miss.

May I come in?
No.

Mr. O'Hanlon.

Look, miss, I told the police
and Wonder Woman everything I know.

You didn't tell her what you were doing
in the back of that truck.

I was going to rent the truck
and I accidentally locked myself in...

How would you know
what I told Wonder Woman?

Pat, you're back.
Lisa, my darling.

Hi.

So, you know nothing about those men?

Like I said-
Those men didn't catch you after all.

What men?
Well...

It's just a little game we play.
Isn't it, Lisa? Not now, darling.

Yeah, Pat's right.
I was just playing our little game.

Yeah. Listen, why don't you run along.
I'll talk to you later.

Missy, thank you very much for the ride.

Yes.
Goodbye.

Lisa, are you really good friends
with Pat?

Oh, yes.

I like to think so.

But I'm sometimes not sure about him.

If you really care about him, you'll tell me
about those men who wanted to hurt him.

But I promised not to.

You don't want to see Pat get hurt,
do you?

Are you a policeman?
I mean, policeperson?

Well, sort of.

Some men tried to take Pat's gold.

How much gold does he have?
A lot.

He has a big old-fashioned pot of it,
filled to the brim.

I saw it by mistake once.

I shouldn't tell you this, but...

I think Pat's a leprechaun.
They always have a pot of gold.

A leprechaun?

Forget it. I was just playing
another little dumb game.

You won't tell Pat I said that, will you?

No, I won't say a thing.

And I promise,
I won't let anyone hurt him, either.

Okay?

Patrick O'Hanlon has a shoe shop where?
Eighty-first.

I'd like a full rundown on him
first thing in the morning, Ira.

As you wish, Diana Prince.

You think O'Hanlon's hiding something?
Yeah.

A pot of gold.
A what?

Steve, what do you know
about leprechauns?

The wee people.
My grandmother told me all about them.

It's an old Irish myth.

Magical little men
who've been given a pot of gold to guard.

Ifyou capture one,
he must give up his gold.

And he has to get it back all by himself.

But if you take your eyes off him,
the leprechaun will disappear.

Why do you ask?

There's a little girl
who thinks that O'Hanlon's a leprechaun.

Pure fantasy.

As much fantasy, perhaps,
as Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor.

Right.

Gold's crated, all ready to roll,
Mr. Bonelli. But that old man-

He must've hid in the truck
while we were here.

He knows where we are.
I'm not worried about O'Hanlon.

He's got something to hide or he would've
gone to the police long before this.

But if he shows up again kill him.

You just let us know where
you want the transaction to take place.

Fine, we're on our way.

All right, go on, back up, the both of you.

You're making one big mistake, O'Hanlon.
Not me, boy-o.

I'm not the one making the mistake,
you are, tangling with the likes of me.

I'll just take what's mine and be gone.

I don't think Mr. Raucher is going
to let you do that.

Aren't you the sly one?

I'm not as big a fool as you think.

I lost O'Hanlon.

One minute his car was right in front
of me, the next minute it was gone.

You'd better put out an all-points bulletin.

That's not good news, Diana.
Right now we need any lead we can get.

Thackery's apparently made arrangements
to leave the country tonight.

Tonight?

Which means he'll be passing
those counterfeit plates off today.

And must have figured out a clever way
of moving the gold back to England.

It's rumored that there is a cheap hood
named Vincent Bonelli...

who's negotiating a gold deal
that's going to put him in the big time.

Bonelli?

He started out as a trigger boy in Philly.

I should think a deal with Thackery
would put him in way over his head.

In any case, if a hood like that gets a hold
of those plates, we're in big trouble.

Say no more.
I'll keep looking for Mr. O'Hanlon.

Nail it up tight,
I don't want this guy getting out.

All right, now get him up, let's go.
Straight back.

Straight back to the door.

There you go. Come on.

All right, open that door now,
and lock him in.

Yeah, that's it.

That will get you out of my hair
and keep you out, old man.

Anybody comes looking for you,
and opens that door...

you're gonna meet with
a very unfortunate accident.

Hey, what is this? Hello!
Where in the devil...

Help! Get me out of here.

Help! Somebody help me.
Get me out of here.

Would you be looking for someone,
Miss Wonder Woman?

As a matter of fact
I was looking for you, Mr. O'Hanlon.

You thought I was one place
when actually I was somewhere else.

A common enough mistake. That thief,
Bonelli, thought the same thing.

What are you doing in here?
Getting my gold.

If you had cooperated
with Diana Prince before...

she might have been able to help you.

Don't you bandy words with me,
Wonder Woman.

You, of all people, should know the rules
under which I must operate.

Do you have any idea where they went?

If I knew that
do you think I'd be standing here?

Mr. O'Hanlon, this is the center
of Bonelli's operations, isn't it?

It is that. Would you care for a tour?
Follow me, ma'am.

Here's where he conducted his business.

I think I might have an idea
where Mr. Thackery is conducting his.

Where's that?

If we're lucky, it's near here,
and that's where the gold is headed.

And so are we.

By we I mean the IADC and
several squad cars, Mr. O'Hanlon.

'Cause I'd like for you to call Steve Trevor
at the IADC, and...

Rasputin.

Pretty soon we'll be in possession
of over $1,500,000 worth of gold.

As well as the counterfeit plates.

He's late.
No, not likely, Bonelli.

Because of you
it's I who am behind schedule.

So let's see what you have. Get on with it.

The doors, come on.

This could take hours.

Bonelli could be meeting Thackery
any place in the airport.

Maybe we'd better split up.

That's a good idea, I'll go with them.

Steve.

Let's go.

It's all there.

The question is, where are the plates?

The plates?

Why, they're where they've always been,
there in Rasputin's vest.

Go get him, Raucher.

What are you trying to pull, Thackery?

It seems to me as if Rasputin doesn't
want to give up the plates.

I can't say I blame him.

Shoot the dog.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Your two friends will load this gold
into that helicopter. Now.

You there, old man. Stop.

Hold it. Nobody moves.

Everybody, drop your weapons.

Pat, it's all right. Get down from there.

I could've handled it myself, missy.
You're my witness.

Hold it there, Thackery.

Move very carefully. And very slowly.

Come on now, old man,
get in here quickly.

Quickly.

Come on, let's get out of here.

Get out!

Will you put me down?

I'd just as soon not make it a habit
of saving your life.

Let's get out of here.

What's going on? Get us out of here.

Get out of here.

Get us out of here.

Rasputin, attack.

Come on, old fellow.

You know better than that. Sit.

Charming puppy.

Mr. O'Hanlon, how did you do that?

We all have our little secrets,
don't we, Miss Wonder Woman?
