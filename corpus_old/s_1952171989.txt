I thought all it needed
was the antenna.

Oh, no. No, lady,
that was just part of it.

Your oscillator variation
control is out.

Your audio analyser is burned and
that TV filter, well, that's all shredded.

It's gonna be a job. Big job.
Can I use your phone?

Yes, of course. It's in the kitchen.
Thanks.

Yeah, I put the antenna up.
Then I stripped down the set.

Ought to be worth about 40 bucks
to put it back together again.

How did you...?

Nail file.

They're putting a new train in service.
Leaves the city at 10 p.m.

How about that?
Don't tell me.

That's a gentle way of saying
you have to work nights again.

Nothing like it. My evenings with you
are worth more than success or gold.

I should think Larry would want you
to save your strength.

He'd go out of business
if you got sick.

Samantha. I have to speak to you.

What's the matter?
I can't talk in front of him.

It's extremely urgent.

There is nothing you can't say to me
that you can't say in front of Darrin.

Well, get rid of him! And hurry up,
it's cold in here.

What did you say, dear?
I said it was sweet of you to say so.

Say what?

About my being more important
to you than gold.

I like the thought.
Sincerely said and honestly felt.

Samantha, I advise you
to listen to me.

What is it, Mother?

It's your father.
He's coming to see you.

Father?
What did you say, honey?

Nothing, darling.

That's funny.

You know, for a moment there I thought
you were talking to the dishes.

Father's coming here?
Yes, he is, tonight.

And he knows you're married.
Well, why so secretive?

Don't you realise what that means,
Samantha?

Of course. Oh, it'll be wonderful
seeing him again, and...

Oh, no.
Exactly.

How are you going to explain Duncan?
Darrin.

His name will be mud when
your father finds out he's human.

Maybe we'd just as well face it now.

I'm married, and there's
nothing he can do about it.

I shudder to think how many things
he can and probably will do about it.

What am I going to do?

Your father?
Yes.

He knows I'm married
and he's coming to see me tonight.

When did you find out about this?
Just now.

You were talking to the dishes.

I was talking to Mother.
She was trying to be unobtrusive.

Well, so your father's coming.
I'd like to meet him.

Father doesn't approve
of mixed marriages.

Well, neither does your mother,
but we worked that out. Sort of.

But Father's different.
He's got a terrible temper.

Honey, it's time he faced the fact.

You're married to me,
what can he do about it?

That's what he can do about it.

You're kidding.
No, Darrin, I'm not kidding.

I know my father. And I better
break the news to him alone.

Okay. Okay, but I'm coming home
right afterwards.

Darrin.

Darrin, look these over, will you?
Yeah, sure, Larry.

Get on it this afternoon,
we'll talk about it on the train.

I forgot to tell you, Larry.
I won't be going home tonight.

Oh, really?

Oh, really. Come on now, Larry. I'm
going to stay in town and have dinner.

Trouble with Samantha?
No, of course not.

Then why can't you go home?

My father-in-law
is coming over tonight...

...and Samantha hasn't told him
about me.

So what? He should be proud to have
the finest account executive...

...of McMann & Tate
for a son-in-law.

I'm afraid that wouldn't
impress him very much.

You're a fine human being, Darrin.
What more does he want?

If I told you, you'd never believe me.

I've got to be strong with Daddy.
After all, I'm not a child anymore.

Better be careful
or you won't be a bride anymore.

It's not fair. No one tells him
how to run his life.

Well, first of all, your father doesn't
run his life. He choreographs it.

Well, I don't care what he does.

When he gets here,
I'm going to stand right up to him.

Father.

Samantha, of course it is.

You've got to be my daughter.
You're positively gorgeous.

Well, what about yourself,
you look marvellous.

Yes, I suppose I do.

All right, Charles,
I shan't be needing you anymore.

Endora.

My love, nice to see you.

Oh, it's nice to see you too, Maurice.
How are you?

In excellent health, thank you.
You wouldn't have it any other way.

Of course not. Close your eyes
and reach in my pocket.

You brought me something?
Haven't I always?

Oh, Father. It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

It's the most beautiful thing
anyone has ever seen.

Endora, a little something for you.
Oh, thank you, Maurice.

Oh, how very thoughtful of you.

From that charming little shop
in Zürich, remember?

Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. Is that
disagreeable little clerk still there?

Oh, yes, he's there.
And still disagreeable.

But very, very little.
Oh, Maurice, you shouldn't have.

It was nothing.
Oh, not the gift, the clerk.

I haven't brought anything
for the man at the house...

...but then what can you create
for a man who has everything?

What's his name?
Darrell? Denny? Dinny?

Donald.
Darrin.

Darrin. Darrin, that's a good name.
It's got a good sound to it.

Darrin. Darrin what?

Stephens.
Stephens?

I don't think I've ever flown into them.
Massachusetts, very old stock.

Good. Are you happy?
Yes, I am.

That's all that's important.
That's what I've always wanted for you.

You really mean that, Father?
Of course I do.

Then I have something to tell you.
Marry the right man, you'll be happy.

The right man?
Haven't I always said that?

Find the man of whom I approve,
and he'll make you happy.

Do you remember
my telling you that?

Yes, now that you mention it.

Doesn't make sense. Why should he
be against your marriage?

He just doesn't approve
of mixed marriages.

Oh, I didn't know you were mixed.

Oh, yes. I'm English
and she's Norwegian.

That's a mixed marriage?
To her father it is.

What is he, a Viking?
Worse.

Well, where is he?
When am I going to get a look at him?

Well, he's not here. Is he, Mother?
I hope not.

What do you mean?
Well, I mean, if he was here...

...he wouldn't be
where he was supposed to be.

Isn't that right, Samantha?

Yes. Yes, Mother, that's right. And
he's supposed to be in Washington.

What do you think of him, Endora?
Well, I...

I think he'll surprise you.

Good.

Good.

Look, Darrin, you love Samantha,
don't you?

Certainly.
Well, then you have to fight for her.

Stand up to the old man.
What can he do to you?

Point a finger at you and blow you up
like you were made of glass?

It's a shame I'm not going to see
that young man of yours.

Yes, well, it's too bad
you can't stay longer.

Darrin should be home in a few days.

He's been working so hard lately.

Well, aren't you going to answer it?

The telephone?
Yes.

Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

Hello?

Oh, hello, Darrin. How are you?
I'm in a bar, getting drunk.

You're so far away,
I can hardly hear you.

He's so far away,
I can hardly hear him.

You won't be home for a week.
Why not?

Oh, that's a shame. You see,
my father dropped in tonight...

...and I was hoping
the two of you would meet.

If you think I'll spend a week
in this bar, you're out of your mind.

Oh, no. No, of course not.
Just a moment.

I think I better take this
in the other room. You understand.

Of course. Go ahead, darling.

She's turned into quite a girl.
Chip off the old block, eh?

If you say so, Maurice.

Chanson du Mer '59.

Quite like old times. Brussels.

Remember I'épaule de mouton?
What a weekend that was.

We were never in
Brussels together, Maurice.

Of course we were,
I remember distinctly. You were...

No, no, perhaps you're right.

You always did have a memory
like a steel trap, Endora.

Chanson du Mer '59,
'53 was much better.

No '53.

Oh, well, probably only
half a dozen bottles left.

Darrin, you can't!
I don't care, Sam. I'm coming home.

I beg of you, Darrin. Please don't
come home. Please listen to me.

I'm through listening. Goodbye.

Hello? Hello, Darrin?

Please understand I'm doing this
for your own good.

Larry!

Larry, get me out of here!

What's the matter?
What do you mean, what's the matter?

I'm stuck in here.
Oh, come on, pull on it. Pull.

What's wrong with this door?

There's Darrin.
We were on our honeymoon.

Nice-Iooking boy.

What's this?

That's Darrin when he was a lieutenant.

Well, what's he doing in the service?
Everybody goes into the service.

Everybody, perhaps, but not us.

Well, you see,
it's really very simple. He's...

He's what?

He's patriotic.
He's always been patriotic.

I have pictures of him in World War I,
the Spanish-American War...

...and the War of 1812.
Before that, I have paintings.

Well, come on, fellas.
Easy. Down easy.

Easy does it.

Yeah, we'll have you out
in a few minutes, Darrin.

Okay.
Did you talk to her?

You bet your life I did.
What did she say?

She said not to come home,
but I said I had enough.

I'm coming home right now.
Want me to drive you?

No, it's too far, but there's
a new train in service, Larry...

...but I don't know
what time it leaves.

Have you got a dime?
Yeah.

Here you are.

Thanks, Larry.

I have in this hand a certificate...

...testifying to the birth of
a male child named Stephens...

...first name Darrin...

...mother, Phyllis, father, Frank.
Would you care to explain?

Yes. Yes, I would.

It's a front to fool the neighbours.
I tried that. It almost worked.

Almost?

I also found this.

"Darrin Stephens.
One capsule after each meal.

Two before bedtime." Does the front
to fool the neighbours...

...extend to the bathroom
medicine cabinet?

No, of course not.

Then why would a warlock
be needing medicine...

...unless, of course,
he's not a warlock at all?

Can you tell me when the last train
leaves for Morning Glory Circle?

Thank you.

Twenty minutes. Larry, can you
have me out of here by then?

Don't worry. If we can't,
we'll ship you railroad express.

Is he or isn't he?
Father, please.

Just tell me the truth.
Is my son-in-law a warlock or not?

You won't get angry?
I reserve that privilege.

Father, please sit down.

It's true.

Darrin is mortal.

You're not angry, are you?

Father, please.

Maurice, control yourself.

Father, your temper.

Stop carrying on.

Stop acting like a child.

Oh, Maurice, you're being ridiculous.

And you, I turn my back
and what happens?

She marries a common,
ordinary mortal.

Darrin is neither common
nor ordinary.

I am not talking to you.
Times have changed, Maurice.

This happens in the best of families.
It does not happen in my family.

Well, it has. It's over and done with.
I'm married.

And I am going to annul the marriage,
Samantha, forever.

Washington, eh?
Father. Mother.

Very good, Endora.

What have you done with him?
Wouldn't you like to know.

Endora.

Perhaps you frighten
Samantha, Maurice...

...but you certainly
don't frighten me.

Where is he?

You're getting stronger, Endora.

You're getting older, dear.
I'll find him.

Wouldn't you like to bring in
the evening paper, dear?

A flower, a bird, a tree.
What do you think, Samantha?

What's that you have there?
Just the evening paper.

I can't understand it.

A girl of your background, your
breeding. I can't understand.

Yes, I can.

It shows a complete lack of respect.
Please!

You young people are all the same:

No feeling for tradition,
no sense of history.

It's a disgrace.

Are you all right, darling?
Yes. Yes, I'm all right.

Excuse me, sweetheart.

Now, look, you. So far
I've been locked in a phone booth...

...turned into a newspaper,
I've been banged on one end...

...and burned on the other.
I may be a source of amusement...

...but I'm also married to your
daughter. She loves me and I love her.

We're gonna stay married whether
you like it or not. Is that clear?

I have to admit, he has courage.

You certainly picked a good one.
I told you, Father.

It's a shame I have to do this.

Father!

Father, how could you?

I did it for your own good, Samantha.
Maurice, you have no right.

You keep out of this, Endora.
Bring him back.

Father, please bring him back.
Someday you'll thank me for this.

Thank you?

I never want to see you again.

You don't really mean that,
you're excited.

How dare you speak like that
to your father?

Maurice...

...I'm not overly fond
of that boy either...

...but I won't have a human being
on my conscience. Bring him back.

I'm sorry, Endora.
What's done is done.

You bring him back,
or I'll make your life miserable for you.

And you know I can do it.

I'll move in with you.

Father, if you love me,
please bring him back.

Does it really mean
that much to you?

I love him. With all my heart,
I love him.

Please don't take him away from me.

Very well.

I'll try.

What do you mean, try?

I'm sorry, Endora.
I gave him a terrible jolt.

Don't waste time, do something.

Well?
I'm trying.

Please, Father, I know you can do it.

He's doing it. You're doing it!
Where's the rest of him?

That's it. That's it, Maurice.
You have it in you. I know you have.

Keep it up, keep it up.
Oh, go to it, Maurice. Go to it.

Oh, look at that technique.

Please try harder, Daddy.

He did it! He did it!

Oh, Darrin.
Very good. Very good indeed.

Is that all of him?
Yes. That's all of him.

You all right, Darrin?

Well...

...here we are.
Just one big, happy family.

Of course, we haven't
discussed it much...

...but I'm partial to large families.
Oh, yes, so am I. Four or five, at least.

Grandchildren might be a good idea.
What do you think, Endora?

There's no need to rush
on my account.

Oh, no. No, of course not.
We have plenty of time.

But there's something
I should tell you.

Lf the first one's a boy...
Now, none of the silly sentimentality.

You don't have to name
the baby after me.

Oh, well, I'm glad you feel
that way, Daddy...

...because Darrin promised his father
that we'd name the first boy after him.

Oh, well, I suppose
some people need that.

Well, I must fly.

But before I go, I want to propose
a toast, Chanson du Mer '59.

Fifty-nine? For this family?
Nothing doing.

How about '53?

Chanson du Mer '53.

Chanson du Mer '53.

Are you...?

Are you sure he's not one of us?
It isn't chilled though.

He's not one of us.

It's chilled, my boy.

Perfect.

Although I take a dim view
of most mortals...

...you've made
a favourable impression, Donald.

Darwin.
Darrin.

After a century or two...

...I might get to like you
as well as I like this champagne.

Too bad you won't be
around that long.

Happiness, darling.

Delightful to see you again, my love.

One and all, auf Wiedersehen.

Goodbye, Daddy.
Yes, goodbye, Mr... Daddy.

Au rev oir, Maurice.

He always was very big on exits.
