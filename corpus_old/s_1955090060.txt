Keep your eyes on the road,
or pull over and I'll drive.

All nurses to the
nurses' station.

Paging Dr. Battaglia.

Call extension 198.
Dr. Battaglia, extension 198.

I heard the other female

in the car with
her may not make it.

We have to move quickly.

She's going into shock.
We're losing her.

You got some more drugs today?

Just a couple. Not much,
no more than that.

Ok. Did you bring me some?

You know I did.

Appreciate that. See
you later on, all right?

See you tonight.

-Ok.
-All right.

Phaedra!

Phaedra! Phaedra!

Phaedra, do you not
hear me calling you?

Say what? God!

Do you not hear me
calling you, girl?

I said, what?

You don't smell that?

I cannot wait to move
out of these apartments.

The smell is driving me crazy.

I don't smell anything.

-You don't smell that?
-No.

Little boys down there smoking

their stinking mess seeping
up through the cracks,

you don't smell it?

No,?

There's a single's meet and
greet tonight at the church

and I was gonna ask
you if you wanted to go,

but I don't have anybody
to watch Mikayla, so...

And you still don't,
because I have plans.

What? Another party?

If you must know, yes.

Nice shot. You don't
do anything anyway.

All you sit around here and do

every day is nothing. Nothing.

And?

And you're a grown
woman without a job,

that don't bother you?

No, 'cause I got money.

Which I'm sure's running thin,

since all you do every weekend

behind another no-good man.

Is that your sanctified
way of calling me a ho?

What? Did I call you that?

Did I say that to you?

No, but you're over here
dropping bombs like I'm stupid.

I know what you're
trying to say, Tammy.

What am I trying to say, Phae?

What am I trying to say?

That I don't do
nothing with my life.

You don't. That's not a lie.

Ok, that's what's up.

I won't be here much longer.

I'm not pushing you out,
all I'm telling you to do,

slow your roll, stop
living in the past

and running behind
these no good men.

And look at you, going
to church to find a man.

I hope you get a good
one tonight, Tammy.

Somebody to be Mikayla's daddy

so you can stop
asking me to watch her.

Church ho.

Wow, Phae, really?
Was that necessary?

Well then, stop popping
off, talking about what I do.

Look.

I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings.

Will you forgive me?

You didn't hurt my
feelings, I'm cool.

Well, good. Then you can
sit here and watch Mikayla.

I'm gonna go get
dressed. Appreciate it.

Black design. I
do like what I see.

Mr. Owens? Mrs.
Owens is on the line.

She said it was urgent.

Malaina, what is this emergency?

Chris, can you
please just come home

before the fashion show tonight?

No, I can't, it's too hectic.

Please. I need you here,
just for a little while.

This pain is unbearable.

Malaina.

I said I can't, ok?

I'll call you, or
I'll have Tiffany

call you to check on you later.

Are you mad at me or something?

No I'm not, I'm not mad.

I'm just tired.

I'm sorry. If you can't
come, I understand.

Well, I love you.

Yeah, me too.

So, what did you
get for number five?

I got two times 22, which was...

How does Mommy look, good?

Do you want me to add something?

I'll call you back, Adriana.

Jewelry, makeup?

Too much cleavage.

What? That was intentional,
why'd you do that?

You're going to church.

I know, but I don't
wanna come home

without a number, at least.

It's rather desperate.

Whatever. Your
Mama has needs too.

Mom, I don't wanna hear
about old people's needs.

Correction, honey. I'm not old.

I just need someone to
talk to that's my age.

There's only so
much I can talk to

my 13 year old daughter about.

Sorry, Mom, but my conversations
are quite stimulating.

What? Little girl, please.

Phae! I'm leaving. I'm gonna
do something to your hair.

How long you gonna be gone?

It's over at ten, but
if I meet somebody,

don't wait up.

Wait, Mom, what's
that supposed to mean?

It just means that,

I might go for drinks and
conversation afterwards.

That's it. Conversation.

But I thought they
were serving dinner

and drinks at the church.

They are.

I haven't met anybody
and you're already

opposed to me having
a conversation?

Goodness! Just saying.

Come over here and
give Mom a kiss.

Yeah, right.

What's that supposed to mean?

Girl, you ain't had
none in what, 12 years?

Girl, when a man
touch your mama tonight

and you gonna hear
singing soprano by 10:15.

That's not a bad thing.

Aunty, that's not funny.

Mom. -What?

Can you please be
back here by 10:30?

Honey, even if I am,

you won't know,
'cause you won't be up.

Don't let her stay up late.

And off that phone 10 o'clock.

-10?
-10 o'clock. Not playing

with you. 10 o'clock.

It's the weekend.
She's not a baby.

Whatever, I can't
expect you to understand.

You ain't a mom. Phae, Phae.

I wasn't thinking
when I said that.

I'm sorry. Phae?
Look, I'm sorry.

Move. Come on, do
you some good. Bye.

Lord, Jesus. Help us, Jesus.

All right, I'm gonna go.

Come lock this door, ok.

I love you.

Yeah, I love you too.

Remember what I said.
Off that phone by 10. 10!

Ok, Mom.

You can do this.

Hello?

Mrs. Owens? Hi. This is Tiffany.

Mr. Owens asked me
to give you a call.

Are you all right?

Tiffany.

Yes, I'll be all right.

Are you sure? I called earlier,
but there was no answer.

I'm actually at the door.

Are you?

I'm sorry, Tiffany. Hold on.

Just give me a minute.
I'll be at the door.

I'm sorry.

The medicine I take for pain
completely knocks me out.

I'm sorry you had to come
all the way over here.

It was no problem, Mrs. Owens.

To be honest, I was
glad to get out of there.

Too much going on.

I was actually getting dressed.

I wanted to surprise
Chris, but I took that pill

and it just knocked me out.

You still can go.

If you miss the show,
there's still a party afterwards.

Ok. Let me get my clothes on.

But it takes me a
while to get dressed.

Yeah, do you mind if
I get dressed here?

Make yourself at home.

Thanks.

Malaina.

My God, Gail!

How are you, darling?

Good.

Where's Chris been
keeping you these days?

Done working on a new project.

Are you modeling again?

No, not me.

No?

No, you know Tiffany Martin.

Chris's assistant.

Hi, Tiffany.

This is Gail Stewart,
one of the top

fashion consultants
in the business.

I've met her before,
seen her before.

She's a doll.
Great on the runway.

Yes, she is. And Freddrick.

Where is he, is he here?

Yeah, he was just here.

I'm looking for my Chris, too.

Have you seen him tonight?

Yes, but not lately.

But if you stick around,
you'll probably see him.

If not, I'll let him know
you're looking for him.

Ok, well, thanks, Gail.

It was wonderful
to see you again.

You too.

And I'll see you in
New York tomorrow night?

With Chris?

Not sure.

Guess that slipped Chris's mind.

Nice to meet you.

There he is. We'll talk soon.

Bye.

Hey, Tammy.
Uncle Nate.

Hey listen, I'll be in
town in a couple of weeks.

I'm gonna drop by and see you.

Yeah, yeah.

Tell your sister I said
I'll see her in two weeks.

Ok. Love you too. Love you too.

All right.

Aunty?

Mikayla, get out of my room!

All right, y'all,
we're slowing it down.

Find that special one
you've been eyeing all night.

Ladies, let your Boaz find you.

That was so much fun.
I had a good time.

Well, the night's still young.

We're grown. -What?

No, I mean, I can
do for some coffee.

I don't know, I kind
of have to get home.

So, maybe another time.

Ok, I understand.

Wait, don't give up so easily.

You're right, we're grown.

And I could use a drink.

A coffee. So, sure.

Well, this is kind of fun.

Not too many churches do this
type of thing for singles.

Yeah, I almost didn't come.

Why not? I had so much fun.

Well, I didn't wanna seem
desperate or anything.

That I can understand.

Just nervous about dating again.

Well, it's been a
while for me too.

Like 12 years.

Whoa, 12 years?

Really? Yeah, 12 years.

It was just me and
my baby for a while.

So I wanted to
give her everything

and dating didn't fit into that.

Ok. I understand that.

One of my buddies talked
me into doing this.

Really?

I wasn't interested
in dating again.

Well you can tell this buddy

thank you for me.

Wanna sit?

Yeah.

Ok.

So why didn't you wanna date?

You don't have like a
stalker ex-girlfriend

out there, do you?

Watching us right now.

No...

I lost my wife in a car accident

a year and a half ago.

I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

It's all right.

Car full of teenagers.
Smoking and drinking.

Enjoying life.

One of them said the driver
swerved right into my wife.

Killed her and my unborn son.

Phaedra, slow down!

Baby girl, I got this.

Slow your butt down
and quit playing.

Will you tell your
mama to stop worrying?

Aunty gonna get us home safely.

Keep your eyes on the road,

or pull over and I'll drive.

Oops. My bad, let
me stop playing.

You ok?

-Yeah, I gotta go.
I'm so sorry. I just...

Wait. Was it something I said?

No, it's not you, trust me.

I just have to go.

Great.

Dang, Tam, dang, Tammy.

My gosh, don't mess this up.

Don't, get it, Tammy,
get it together.

Get it together. ok. ok. ok.

Ok. And I didn't
even get his number.

I've got to. Come on, Tammy.

Excuse me, miss, excuse me.

Are you all right?

No, the car just stopped.

I don't know what's
wrong with it.

Well, pop the hood, let me
check it out for you, ok?

Looks like it's running hot.

Let me go inside and get
some coolant for you, ok?

Hey. Do you need
any help or anything,

are you ok?

Yes. No. I have someone coming.

Well, do you want me to
wait with you till they come?

I mean, you just look like

you could use a friend.

And to be honest,
I could use one too.

Your wine, ma'am.

Thank you.

Slow down. You're not gonna
find your answers in there.

Then where?

My life is falling apart.

I'm sick, and it's
ruining my life.

My husband's cheating. My
car's stopped out of nowhere.

Give me some answers, then.

Everything happens
for a reason, Malaina.

Everything.

That's the best that
you can come up with?

No, look, listen.

God, He uses our experiences to

build our character
and our faith in Him.

You're one of them.

What is that?

Like my grandma.

I don't even care about
that stuff anymore.

I get it.

Your struggle is internal.

You're not gonna find it
on the outside, sweetheart.

Do you know how to pray?

Pray?

Yeah, pray.

I haven't prayed since
I was a little girl.

I used to pray with my grandma

and my grandpa about school,

or my binky, or for
my mom to get well.

I think I understand
what's going on here.

I believe that God is
using your experiences

to get you talking to Him again.

He hasn't forgotten about you.

He created you. He
loves you, Malaina.

It's gon' be ok.
I promise.

Let me pray for you.

Dear Father. In
the name of Jesus,

I thank you for who You are.

Malaina.

Malaina!

We need to talk.

Look, Chris.

I don't wanna fight tonight.

Let's talk tomorrow.
I don't feel good

and I just wanna lie down.

You see, that's my problem.

Right there.

You're always too
tired or sleepy,

and I can't touch you
anymore or have sex

because you never
know when you're gonna

have another episode.

We can't go out
in public no more

because you're always
rushing off to a bathroom.

Now your near misses,
you're puking all the time,

this is embarrassing.

It's obviously nothing working.

Doctors, surgeries, medicine.

It's insufferable.

And you can't be
so naive to think

that another woman
wouldn't be in the picture.

It's obvious, Malaina.

It ain't working
out for you, me.

I want a divorce.

I knew I'd find you here.

Mikkey.

You not talking, now?

Listen, I know I hurt
your feelings the other day

and I didn't mean
to yell at you.

I'm sorry. You forgive Aunty?

I have nothing to say to you.

You use drugs and
you know better.

I'm 13, and everywhere I go

there's somebody smoking
weed, popping pills,

or mixing pills and alcohol,
trying to get higher.

Kids my age and younger.

Teenage boys on
the steps smoking

over at Adriana's house.

Now in my own house?

Is life that bad that's
the only alternative?

I'm not mad at you. I hate you.

Mikayla.

Mikkey. Look.

I didn't know you were
that passionate about it.

I promise, I'm sorry,
I won't smoke anymore.

Yeah, whatever.

Mikayla. You are my niece.

I love you more than
anything in this world.

There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you.

I promise, I'll quit.

Really, Aunty?
I'll hold you to it.

How did I get such
a responsible niece?

This is embarrassing.
I want a divorce.

It's obviously nothing working.

Doctors, surgeries, medicine.

It's insufferable.

This is embarrassing.
I want a divorce.

It's obviously nothing
working. It's insufferable.

Shut up!

God, if you're still
there, I need you.

Malaina?

Miss Malaina?

Malaina!

Malaina?

Tiffany?

Malaina.

You scared me. What
are you doing here?

I called your
phone several times,

but you didn't answer.

So I came by.

I can't stay. I heard about
the party and your car.

So I wanted to check on you.

Thanks, Tiffany, but I
didn't call you today.

It may have been Mr. Owens.

Probably. It doesn't matter.

Either way, I'm just glad
you came when you did.

Why? You ok?

Yeah. I will be.

Can I share something with you?

Yeah.

In confidence?

Sure.

My marriage is over.

Chris told me last
night he wants a divorce.

I had to say it out loud.

I've been feeling like
I'm trapped in a nightmare.

I try to voice what's
going on inside me,

try to get a sense of reality,

like a sense of power,

like I have control back.

A sense of freedom?

Exactly.

Just a moment
ago, I was about to

completely give up.

I felt so...

so useless.

Ever been in a store,
suddenly you have to go

and you rush as fast as you can

to end up not making it in time?

You have a accident
right on your clothes.

What do you do?

Who can you call in
a situation like that?

You have to walk out in
whatever didn't get soiled.

And whatever shred
of dignity you had

is left behind the stall doors.

Miss Malaina, I'm sorry.

I didn't know.

No, don't apologize.

Like I said, speaking about it

gives me power over it.

You are a strong,
phenomenal woman.

You've always
been so kind to me.

I was hired when you
first started getting sick.

And you never let it change

how you treated
people around you.

You were my silent mentor.

I'm glad you were there.

Tiffany, you're my angel.

Thank you. It means so much.

Wow. I feel like a big sister.

You're welcome.

Mr. Owens loves you.
He will see that.

Hopefully sooner than later.

I'd better go.

Yeah. Right.

With Chris out of town,

I don't know what to
do in this big house.

When people come over, I don't
know how to let 'em leave.

By the way, you look beautiful.

What's the occasion?

I told you. You inspire me.

So I just had my
first photo shoot.

Congratulations! With who?

An agency I met at the party.

I'll call you with
the details later.

Because...

I'm meeting with my
boyfriend right now.

Ok, well call, I wanna
hear all about it.

And about that
boyfriend stuff too.

Ok, I'll call you later.

Hey Phae, baby, you're looking
real good in that outfit.

Where you about to go?

What you doing here?

I've been calling and you ain't

answering none of my calls.

You know what, I lost my phone.

But what's up?

You. Still ain't got paid
for what I gave you yesterday.

It's like that?

How much I owe you?

I don't want your money.

We can talk about what
you owe me upstairs.

Dude, you're drunk. Move.

Man, you're playing games.

One minute you're all over me,

now you're acting
like you don't know

what's about to go down.

-Dude, you're drunk...

Don't you ever put
your hands on me

like that disrespecting
me, you understand?

What's up, y'all?

Phaedra, you ok?

She all right, man,
this don't concern you.

I'm not talking to
you, I'm talking to her.

Phaedra, you ok?

Tell the man. You're ok, right?

No. He just tried to choke me.

-Get over here...

Where did you go?

I went to go downstairs
and talk to Officer Thomas.

You ok?

Yeah, I just kinda,
you know, feel weird.

Wanna lay down.

Did he hurt you?

No, baby, I'm ok.

Look, I need to talk to you.

-Ok.
-Go.

I'm glad you're all right.

Thank you, Mikkey. Good night.

-Good night.
-Good night, baby.

What's up?

Look.

I just need to talk
to you because I

honestly I can't keep
this bottled up any more.

I know I'm not
perfect, and I know that

I've made mistakes
when I was younger.

And I should have been an
example for you but I wasn't.

I messed that up.

But I can't watch you
hurt another day, Phae.

Tammy, not another
one of your lectures

about my lifestyle
and what I do,

who I date and all of that,
I mean going to church.

I'm not you, Tammy,
I'm not ready.

I'm not, I promise you
I'm not lecturing you.

I just wanna talk to you...

-You know, can we
talk tomorrow, 'cause...

Ok, Phae.

Good night.

Good night.

Jesus, please.

I didn't even notice
he locked up everything.

Really? That's wonderful.

Maybe we can go out tonight.

Drinks on me.!

I don't drink.

What? Since when?

This morning.

Child, please.

I'm serious.

You really gonna stop this time?

You said that so
many times before,

and you always wound
up drinking again.

I don't wanna drink anymore.

Thanks for the vote of
confidence, but yes, I am.

Where are you?

Calm down. I'm outside.

I'm hanging up.

I mean, what was he thinking?

If you had an emergency,
how would you get around?

I mean, I thought Chris
was one of the good ones.

I guess he said you
ain't taking nothing

while he's gone.

I'm not stealing it.
We're still married.

I just need some
transportation while he's gone.

Let mine lock me out.

He'll come back and
the house will be gone.

Stop it.

Ok, so how are you
getting in here?

This don't make no sense.

Look at all this opulence.

And you don't have
a key to nothing?

I'm not leaving him. The
keys are in the garage.

It feels like hellfire out here.

I'm going in.

Hold on, I got an idea.

Give me your shoe. Come on.

You what? For what?

Just give me the freaking shoe.

Dang!

Now that's Christian
Louis Vuitton in your hand.

Now don't...

do nothing stupid.

I tell you. Life
throws you curves.

You can be intimidated
by the spin or the speed

and foul out like a wuss,

or brace yourself.

Watch it closely, and
whack it out of the park.

It's too late, I already
told her I want a divorce.

You told your
sick, depressed wife

of seven years
you want a divorce?

Yeah.

Pazzo!

I tell you something.

I have cancer. Gail is
at every appointment,

treatment or surgery.

Sometimes, I feel like
I'm holding her back.

She is beautiful
and full of life.

But I wake up, and
see her every morning.

And I'm so grateful
she is there.

I tell you, this.
Malaina loves you.

This chasing skirts is for the.

The decision is yours.

Why'd you leave?

I wasn't much in a
social mood tonight.

Is there something I can do?

What, are you not
in the mood for me?

This ain't gonna happen.

What now?

This ain't what I want.

When did you decide that?

Why am I here?

You're right. I'm gonna
get you another room.

I thought we were
gonna be together.

You need to decide who you want.

I have.

You stay away from me.

You hear me? You
stay away from me.

? Jesus

? Bless that wonderful name of

? Jesus

? No other name I know

? Yes, there's
joy in the name of

? Name of Jesus

? Yes, there's
joy in the name of

Hallelujah.

Someone be set free.

Father God, that someone
be redeemed and delivered.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah,
become a saved child,

son of God.

Father God, we thank
You for salvation today.

We thank You Lord
Jehovah that You, Lord,

given us a mind to
wanna seek You, Lord.

Praise you and
glorify Your name.

To live this life
with joy in your life.

So we find that
that's why some people

are having a hard time trying

to come to reality of what
life is offering them right now.

But Jesus has a way
for you this day.

He has a way for you this day.

Through everything,
through everything.

All that we're doing and
all that we're going through,

Jesus has that way for us.

Just hear Him.

He has not allowed any
trial to come upon us

that, temptation to come

that there is not
a way to escape.

He won't let no more come
upon you than you can bear.

He won't let no more come
upon you than you can bear.

And if it's there,

then God has a way in your trial

for you to get out.

He has a way in your
trial for you to get out.

And so it's up to us today

to realize I wanna come to God.

I wanna bring everything to God.

In order for you to do that,

you have to learn to forgive

and ask forgiveness.

Ask for forgiveness, ask God

to forgive you of your sin,

ask God to change the
way you're thinking,

and then forgive yourself.

See, forgive yourself.

Excuse me, Tammy?

Hey, Sherrod.

Boy, I'm so sorry for running
out on you the other night.

That was completely rude of me.

Was it something I said or did?

No, no, no, it.

Trust me, it has
nothing to do with you.

It's all me.

But maybe we could talk
about this another time.

Yes, please. Here's my card.

Ok, well, I will definitely
be giving you a call.

Ok. Can I walk you to your car?

No, we're right outside
the door, but thank you.

Such a gentleman.

All right. Well,
we'll be talking later?

Indeed we will. Bye.

Bye.

What was that?

Nosy! That's the
man I met on Friday.

Phae, you ok?
You need anything?

No.

Hey. I saw Thomas downstairs.

He told me what happened.

Are you all right?

That bastard tried to rape me.

But he didn't.
And he tried twice.

But to no avail
was he successful.

Sis, you can't really think

God's not looking out for you.

You were right about one thing.

I've really made
a mess of my life.

No, Phae. We all make mistakes.

Hear me when I say that.

Don't beat yourself
up over this.

It's not worth it.

That's easy for you to say.

You got a good
life, a great house,

a good job, and Mikkey.

You got somebody that you love

that loves you back.

And you have us. And
we love you, Phaedra.

Now stop. Get up, let's
get out of here, ok?

Come on. It's too
stuffy in here.

I'll be out in a minute.

Ok.

You should have
been at Bible study.

Pastor Jakes was on it,
girl, about forgiveness.

Broke some chains, girl...

-Tammy.
-What?

You know I don't buy into
that forgiveness crap.

It's a bunch of bullcrap.

I ain't gon' ever forgive Vern

for the stuff he
did to me today.

And he is back in jail,
where he belongs, Phae.

Don't let that man
rob you of a happy life

because of that one incident.

One incident?

What about the man
that killed my baby,

should I forgive
him, too, Tammy?

Listen, you can go on about this

forgiveness mumbo jumbo,
you got your child.

I was young, I know,
but I would have

taken care of my baby.

I would have done right by mine.

-Phae, you
really need to let...

No, Tammy, you
need to go to hell

and take forgiveness with you.

Ok. Well I'm gonna
go pray for us both.

Ok, do that.

Some Spirit's dwindling in here.

Make yourself comfortable.

I love your home, Malaina.

The light fixtures are gorgeous.

Thank you.

I pray I can have one
like this of my own soon.

You will. Just keep praying.

You can have anything if
you just believe in it.

Well look at you, on the
Jesus bandwagon, girl.

Hallelujah!

Tammy, I feel so much peace now.

I'm not worried or afraid.

I've been reading and praying.

I just know that by
His stripes I'm healed,

and my life is in His hands.

I wish I could get my
sister to believe that.

I've been praying on
peace for both of us,

and it's, and the pastor
was talking about secrets

and finding freedom from them,

and then I was watching
Oprah on some show,

and she had Bishop TD Jakes

talking about forgiveness.

Forgiveness?

Yes. Honey, how you
have to let go of it,

or deprive you of a happy life,

and bitterness becoming
like a cancer if you let it.

It's really hitting a little
too close to heart for me,

and I don't know what to do or

how I'm gonna handle it.

Is there anything that I can do?

No. Thank you, but no.

It's something I
gotta do on my own.

No, you need to pray about it.

And if there's
anything you need,

any help or anything,
just let me know.

I will. But you,

need to pray and talk
about it with your husband.

You and Chris need to pray
about it, and talk about it.

Just another little
bump in the road.

Y'all be fine.

I know.

Y'all be fine.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
Glad we met, honey.

Me too.

Thank you, Jesus.

Sorry, excuse me.

Uncle Nate!

My God, baby girl! Look at you!

You are so beautiful
and all grown up!

Thanks.

I guess your mother
cut back on the salt

and started using fertilizer?

You all right? -Yeah, I'm fine.

-You ok? You sure?
-Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah. I'm gonna tell you
about it in just a minute.

Excuse me, Miss Richards.
We're pretty much done here.

If you or your sister
have any questions

going forward, here's my card.

Ok. I'll definitely
have Phaedra call you

if there's any problems.

Thank you, Detective...

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

Detective? What's going on here?

I'll fill you in about
it later, Uncle Nate.

Thank you for stopping by.

Thank you.
Have a good night.

Long story, Uncle Nate.
And it's Phaedra. Not me.

So they haven't
arrested this punk yet?

I mean, they did, but
he got out and came back.

Yeah? Well, I wish he
comes around while I'm here.

Uncle Nate...

What's wrong, baby?

You know what, when
you were a little girl

you would always drop
your head just like that

when you had something to say

and you didn't know
quite how to say it.

So I know something's wrong.

Unc,

you're the only person
I could tell this to.

Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Am I going to need a drink?

I'm kidding, baby,
you all right?

Listen, this is
something serious, right?

You need to tell me.

Do you remember when
Phae and I were teens

and we got in that car accident?

Well...

I did something bad.

Mom, I'm home.

Ok, baby, I'm in the kitchen.

I'm hungry. Can I get a snack?

Yeah. Did you have
a good day, baby?

Mom, we have a project
for Black History.

I need some family photos.

They say whoever brings
in the oldest photo

gets a day off from homework.

Can I get the photo
album out of your room?

Hello, Mom?

What, baby, I said
you could have a snack

nothing too heavy, 'cause
you won't eat dinner.

And we're having a guest later,

so make sure you hurry up
and finish your homework

so you can straighten up.

Mom.

What?

Can I ask you a question?

Not right now, baby, I'm
trying to finish dinner.

Real quick.

What, baby, what is it?

Who is Jonathan Anthony Walker?

And why's my name...

Phaedra, slow down!

Baby girl, I've got this.

Slow your butt down
and quit playing.

Will you tell your
mama to stop worrying?

Aunty gon' get us home safe.

Keep your eyes on the road

or pull over and I'll drive.

My bad. Let me stop.

God, what am I gonna do?

I'm trying so hard.

God, God, please,
please, please God.

Mom. Mama?

Yeah. Hold on, Mikayla.

What's up, babe?

Mom, are you ok?

Yeah.

Mommy's fine. I'm fine.

Ok.

It's not, it's not
something I can talk

to you about right now, but...

Why, what's wrong?

You know Mommy loves you, right?

Very, very, very much

I would do anything
for you, Mikayla.

Let's just talk about
it another time, ok?

Ok.

Go finish your homework.

I love you.

Hey stinky.

Hey, Aunty.

What's going on? Why...

Why'd you call
me to pick you up?

Well...

I got suspended off the bus.

Does your mama know?
She gon' kill you.

I know, that's why I called you.

What is that supposed to mean?

You'll just yell for a bit,

but Mama, she'll just
take it overboard.

Well, that's true.

So what happened, why'd you
get suspended off the bus?

'Cause the bus driver's
just such a liar.

Girl, watch your mouth.

You know not to disrespect
your elders like that.

What did he do?

Well...

This girl Carrisa
has a fight with me

every day on the bus.

I told him, but he
didn't do anything.

So today, I sat at
the back of the bus

and she told on me,
he told the principal

that I sat back
just so I could sit

by this boy named Devonte,
so I called him a l...

a storyteller, so
they wrote me up.

I'm a veteran.
Don't try to play me.

You really went back there

to sit with that little
boy Devonte, didn't you?

I did, but...

he don't like her.

-See, I told you I couldn't two
-step.

You sure did a good job stepping

all over my feet.

You ok?

Yeah. Yeah.

I'm glad I met you.

I finally feel like
I'm living my life

and not someone else's
when I'm with you.

And it's nice. It's really nice.

-Maybe we...

Yeah. We should clear this up.

Sorry.

Did I do something wrong?

No, it's not you, it's me.

I'm so sorry. I just...

Please don't leave like that.

Ok. Sit down. I...

I have something to tell you.

So, Aunty, my name is Mikayla
Dejounay Walker, right?

Yeah. Walker's your last name.

That's your dad's last name

and then your first
name is Mikayla,

which is in honor of
my daughter that died

in a car accident.

She would have
been about your age.

So then why on my
birth certificate

it says Mikayla Dejounay Craig,

and on the death certificate,

it says Charlotte
Anthony Walker?

Who is that?

What? Mikayla, where did
you find these certificates?

In Mama's photo album.

Where's the photo album, Tammy?

But...

Where's the photo album?

What's going on?

This ain't got
nothing to do with you.

Phaedra, calm down,
let me explain.

Know what, you a low down, lying

church-going baby stealer?

What a hypocrite!

13 years you let me believe

my baby died in that accident?

I'm sorry.

And the insurance money, Tammy?

-I'm sorry...

-You swapped my baby!
-It wasn't like that!

What was it like?

You were in a coma, Phae.

I took her out of the hospital
and they gave her to me.

They didn't know you
were gonna make it...

But I did. I'm here!

And by then, Phae, I'd had
her for six months Phae!

I loved her and
she loved me back.

She was mine now, I
couldn't just give her up.

But you let me cry
thinking my baby was dead,

like it was my fault I
killed my own child, Tammy?

You killed mine.

My baby died that night.

It was my baby.

I told you to slow down
and you didn't listen, Phae.

You took my child from me.

So, right, I took yours.

I didn't kill your baby.

That man that hit
us killed your child,

the one you keep
telling me to forgive.

That's not true.

So you forgive him
now, church lady.

Mikayla, let's go.

No, you're not taking my baby.

You're not taking...

No, Mikayla!

No, please don't take my baby!

Mikkey, you all right?

Look, I know this is
crazy for you, and,

I want you to understand
this is crazy for me, too.

I'm gonna go in
and take a shower.

You can go to the
vending machine

and get you something
to eat if you want

and then we can talk
it out, all right?

Don't be too long, ok?

Ok.

Now who is that on
my door like that?

Where she at?

-Who?
-Mikayla.

She's not here.

Don't play dumb with me, Tammy.

-If I find out
she's here, I swear...

-Girl, I...

Mikkey? Mikayla.

Mikayla. Mikkey.

Mikayla? Mikkey?

Mikayla, what are
you doing out here?

I don't know what to do.

My mama's my aunt,
and my aunty is my mom.

This is too crazy.

I love you both, but my mom,
I cannot stop loving her.

I know, Mikayla, but this...

this isn't for you to work out.

It's between me and your mo...

your aunt Tammy.

Is she gonna get in trouble?

I haven't told anybody
what's going on.

I'm still trying to sort
it all out in my head.

But Mikkey, no matter
what, you're loved.

We're gonna figure
all of this out.

And running away, it's
not solving anything.

Come on, we need
to go, it's cold.

What you doing here, Kay?

Straight mom gonna kill you.

Yeah, I meant to ask you,

like what's up with you
and your mama problem?

Why does everybody
keep bringing that up?

I'm sick and tired
of hearing it.

I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

Ok, my bad, I just
heard a lot of stuff

and I just wanted to see
if you wanted to talk.

Man, they have female trauma?

I know, I heard
about her two mamas.

Two mamas are just sisters,

so you need to
calm down with that.

I'll bet.

Yeah, I bet, you need to chill.

Why you always kissing
up to her anyway?

Why you always gotta start
stuff, what you got a problem?

Mikayla, don't worry about it.

I like that.

It's cool.

Grab it.

You gonna smoke or stare at it?

Know what I'm sayin'
get off my back.

Mikayla, where you gonna go?

I said I can't do this stuff.

She always thinkin'
she better than us.

Let that heifer go.

Say that to me one more time.

I am going to beat your...

By His stripes, I am healed.

Am I interrupting something?

No, you're fine.

Well, thank you, I try.

No, it's just a
little doctor humor.

I'm Dr. Moses Buwie.

I'm the
gastroentorologist on call.

Let me check your
breathing here real quick.

If you could lean
forward for me.

Give me a deep breath.

Another one.

All right. If you could
lean back a little bit,

just lie back.

Are you having any
abdominal pains whatsoever?

Not at the moment.

Right, right. Good. ok.

You can sit up.

I had a moment to
go over your charts.

I do have a few concerns, ok?

We're gonna get you out of here

as soon as possible, though,
just sit tight. Right?

Good evening.

Hello?

Am I dying? You came to
read me my last rites?

No, I'm a minister and
I'm here to pray with you.

Me along with some
other ministers,

we visit patients
in the hospital,

and we offer prayer
for those that want it.

'cause I thought...

well, never mind.

Well since you're here,
can I ask you a question?

Hope I can answer it.

Why are people so sick nowadays?

All these different
diseases popping up.

Where's God in all of this?

Why does He allow it?

That's a good question.

If you had a son, would
you allow him to be beat,

and put to death for
something you caused?

No.

Good answer.

Well, it's Satan.

The Bible says he is
the author of confusion.

That's the reason
for drug abuse,

depression, the list goes on.

But this God, He
came to give us life.

He came to give us life.

Really?

Yes. Jesus tells of
a story in the Bible

of a man who was born blind.

And the disciples,
they wondered,

well, whose fault is it
that this man is born blind?

Is it his fault, or is it
the fault of his parents?

And Jesus said, neither
he or his parents' fault.

But that the will of
God may be made manifest

in his condition.

See, when Satan
comes in to attack us,

we can counterattack
with prayer and faith.

Those are our weapons.

And that's what Jesus used.

And he got good results.

The man, well,
he was made whole.

So let's pray.

Let's pray. Can
I take your hand?

Dear Father, I thank You
for this precious child,

this daughter of Yours, God.

You are omniscient,
You're omnipresent.

You know all and You're
here with us right now.

I don't know what
her condition is,

but You know.

And Father, I lift
her up before You.

I ask You to give her peace,

I ask You to give her strength,

more important I ask
You to heal her body.

Touch her from
the top of her head

to the tips of her toes.

Make her well again.

Make her whole again.

Give her life, and
give her joy and peace.

This in Christ's
name we pray. Amen.

Amen.

Well, thank you.

Remember, we'll be
praying with you.

God bless you.

Thank you so much.

You're more than welcome.

You're more than welcome.

I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

No, come on in. I
was just praying.

You know, my foster
mother used to

pray for people in the hospital.

You never told me that.

I never even seen you pray.

Well, just because
you never see me pray

don't mean I don't.

What's the secret about praying?

No secret, it's just...

I've never seen you
pray, so I didn't know

if you'd had a problem
with me praying.

I didn't know that.

I used to pray all the
time with my grandmother.

But after she died, I didn't
wanna talk to God anymore.

You know my foster
mother used to say

that even when you stop
praying with your mouth,

He's still listening
to your heart.

Old wisdom.

Yeah.

I wish I had met her.

Me too. You'd like her.
She's a lot like you.

Hello?

Mrs. Owens.

Yes?

Hey, this is Dr.
Buwie, how are you?

I'm good, how are you?

Good, good.

Well, I don't normally do this,

but I found these
circumstances to be unique,

so the test that you took
when you first arrived

showed what our Doctor
believed was Crohns disease.

Yes, I was diagnosed
with it two years ago.

After looking at these results,

I don't see any
evidence of inflammation

in your intestines whatsoever.

But I did find in another test

that you are almost
two months pregnant.

My God!

Yes.

Well, congratulations, guys.

Thank you so much.

-Ok. Bye
-bye.

Bye.

My God! Baby!

Yes!

My God!

Look, Phae, I know
you don't want me here,

but it's about Mikayla.

So, her school called me today

and informed me that
she's missed four days

in the past two weeks.

Not to mention when I
get home from work today,

she's in the corridor
with several kids.

What's going on?

Mikayla, go to your room.

Why? Are there any more
secrets I have to know about?

Like is Mr. Thomas my daddy?

Don't ever disrespect
your mother like that.

Do you understand
me? Now, apologize.

Girl?

I'm sorry, Ma.

Little girl,

I know I've only been your mama

for a couple weeks, but

I've been your aunty
your whole life.

You try that mess with me again,

and I promise you it'll
be the last word you speak.

Do you understand
me? Go to your room.

-She's just acting
out. You know, she...

Listen, let's get
something straight.

I don't like you and I
don't want you in my house.

So don't come over
here and try to play

that sister sister
crap with me, Tammy.

Look, I know what it's
like to lose a child,

so I understand the pain
you're having to revisit,

in addition to losing this one.

But Mikayla is my child.

I'm not going to
separate you from her,

but as far as me and you?

I'm gonna have to work
on that forgiveness thing

and I'm not ready, so
you can see yourself out.

Girl, I guess she
thought I wasn't

gonna ever find out...

Phaedra! How are you doing?

Hi, Kim!

What a coincidence, I
just seen your sister.

Just seen Tammy.

Yeah, please don't let
my sister know where I am.

Why? What's going on?

Girl, Tammy has lost her mind.

I don't wanna have
nothing to do with her,

let alone talk about her.

Well, that's your sister.

It couldn't be that bad.

Not that bad?

Has your sister ever told you

your baby died while
you were in a coma,

paid you the settlement money
for the death of your child,

all the while raising
the child as her own

right in front of your nose?

Are you serious?

I can't even begin to
understand how you feel.

But let's focus on Tammy.

Have you sat down and thought

what made her go through
such drastic measures?

I don't give a...

Excuse me, I don't
mean to disrespect you,

I know you're a minister, Kim,

but I don't really
care what made

Tammy do the things she did.

It's ridiculous.

You know what?

There was a story in the
Bible that was similar to this.

And what we have to do
is focus on the child.

Let's put our thoughts
and our anger aside,

and let's think about the child.

A real mother will
make the right decision.

Yeah, whatever.

You know what? God
gonna forgive you.

And you keep trusting Him.

Put all this mess
aside, and you trust God.

And He's gonna forgive you,

He will restore you
guys' relationship.

I believe it. All right?

Whatever, ok.

Well, I'm gonna leave you alone.

But you give me a call
if you need me, love.

Ok.

I'll be here for you.

Thanks, honey. Appreciate you.

Good seeing you.

If you need me, just
give me a call, ok, love?

All right.

Bye.

Phaedra, I know...

I miss you, Phae.

I know you don't
wanna talk to me sis,

but please call me back, please.

I'm going crazy, and I...

I just need to talk to you.

I love you. Bye.

Hey, Phae.

Hey, Tammy.

I'm not trying to waste
any of your time or nothing.

I just...

I just wanna say I'm
sorry for lying to you

and...

betraying you like...

I'm sorry.

I just miss my sister.

Look, Tammy, I...

I know you always drilling
Jesus, Jesus to me, and

you know, I'm not
quite there, but

I am willing to give this whole

forgiveness thing a try, 'cause

I can't raise Mikayla
without you, I can't.

I can't do life without you.

You're all I got.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I love you.

I love you too.

What you think?

He burns food. He
does not cook it.

It's well done.

No that, my friend, is burnt.

It...

No, eat it, it's fine
man, that ain't burnt.

No, put it down.

No, no, no, no.

What you think?

Burnt.

Wasn't that fun?

It was.

That food was so good.

Glad you invited me.

Tammy, you do not
have to do that.

-No problem.
-Thanks so much for coming.

Thank you for having me.

Let me introduce you
to my sister Phaedra.

-Hi.
-We met briefly.

Thank you so much for coming.

Tammy told me so much about you.

Tammy?

It wasn't bad, I promise.

No, it wasn't
anything bad, trust me.

Good.

When are you due?

Any day now.

What are you having?

A boy, but my husband doesn't
know anything about it.

What? How did you
keep that a secret?

What are you naming him?

Ian Christopher. Ian
means gift of God.

-So great!
-Thank you.

So happy for you, I really am.

You're just
glowing, and floating

on ice and water, girl,

I want what you got.

I am. I can't
imagine a better life

than the one I have now.

I wish I could
imagine that life.

It ain't my time yet.

Malaina, your house
is so beautiful.

It's too big.

Too big. Not for long,
Jesus, with these kids.

She just popping out one, two,

and three coming, five.

We are gonna take
it slow this time.

I don't even know what
to do with this one.

I know someone that

can help. -Who?

She did an amazing
job with hers.

We did an amazing job,
I didn't do it by myself.

Tammy, you know, I
never did thank you.

It's Ok. I never did say
thank you for forgiving me.

So, thank you for that.

I'm really happy
to have you back.

You know, I couldn't stay mad.

-I know, I'm too awesome.
-I love you.

I love you too, sis.

-What's wrong?
-Are you ok? What's wrong?

My water just broke!

I think it did, too.

Chris!

God, it's nasty.
