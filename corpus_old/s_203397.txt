So is everybody this lonely
when they're in love?

They embrace a pain that's
deeper than the shadows?

It's all to make us shine,
I just know it...

I loveyou, I loveyou,

I gaze atyou with my heart...

I believe in you, I believe in you,

even on the coldest ofnights.

I call out toyou with my tears,

but I don't need any promises...

That's the precious strength
you've given to me...

Van! Snap out ofit, Van!

What's wrong, Hitomi?

Van's in trouble!

Van! Open your eyes!

Van!

Van, snap out ofit!

Stop! You might not
be able to come back,

just like that time
with the Doppelganger!

Hitomi!

Ifwe don't do
something, Van's gonna...

We're gonna lose Van!

No!

Hitomi...

Van, where areyou?!

Van!

Van, wait!

Van!

It stopped!

This isn't Heaven, I guess...

Van, let's go back.

Everybody's waiting.

Van?

What?

Van! Snap out ofit!

It's already been three miets.

We have to bring at least
<i>Hitomi</i> around, or they'll both...

No!

Hey, you dumb broad!
Don't give up!

Getyour act together and
bring Van back here!

Hey! Areyou listening to me?!

Lord Van!

Merle?

Lord Van! Come back!

Merle!

Van!

Van! <i>Fly!</i>

Van!

He's alive!

Lord Van...!

Merle...

It's all because ofyou...

Thanks!

You're all incompetent.

Guimel... Dallet... Shesta...
Gatty... Viole...

Where's the glory in dying
in a fight like that?

<i>Don'tleavemealone!</i>

<i>Don'tleavemealone!</i>

Alone...

<i>With the conquestofFreid,</i>
<i>the PowerSpotis ours.</i>

<i>However...</i>

The dragon, Lord?

<i>Indeed.</i>

<i>The fate ofthe dragonisshrouded</i>
<i>inmist, growingeverdimmer.</i>

Leave it to me, Majesty.
My next plan is already in motion.

<i>Capture the dragon!</i>

Why?

Why does my hand shake
when I hold my sword?

Van...

Allen?

Don't worry about Van.

But he's been like that
ever since the fight.

This is a trial that must be overcome
by all who would be swordsmen.

I speak from experience.

Vanity and arrogance draw
you into a haze offear.

Areyou the boywho's been picking
fights with swordsmen lately?

Ifyou're scared offighting me,
leave all your money and get lost!

Ifyou do, I'll spareyour life.

You seem to have some skill.
What's your name?

Allen Schezar.

Come on!

Your technique is excellent.

But...

I see no promise in a swordsman
who thinks only oftechnique.

Kill me!

Kill me, damn it!

Why areyou in such a hurry to die?

I have no family and no home.
My sword is all I have.

How can I go on living ifI lost?!

Swordsmanship isn't about
strength. Or technique.

What's important comes from within.

It's <i>yourself</i>thatyou must hone!

That was how I met
Balgus. My master.

He showed me the light
when I was all but lost.

Mastering the sword means
mastering yourself.

But I still haven't come close
to matching his skill.

I...

That's not true.

You're amazing and you're strong.
And you're nice, too.

I...

I don't know anything about
swords orwhatever,

and I don't think he'd listen
to anything I said...

But I'm sure he'd listen toyou.

You're terrific, and
everybody looks up toyou.

And I likeyou.

Anyway, ifyou could help
Van, that'd be great!

You like me, huh?

Sometimes you're quite
the little fiend, Hitomi.

The mysterious power of Hitomi,
the girl from the Mystic Moon...

Van, in whose veins flows
The blood of Draconians...

Escaflowne...

And Zaibach, which is
after the Power Spot...

Strange occurrences
happening one after another...

This is driving me nuts!
I know I almost have it!

Um... Dryden? Thankyou.

Forwhat?

Spare me the pleasantries.

It doesn't costyou anything to bow.

What areyou getting at?

I came to apologize for my poor manners
because I was wrong aboutyou!

Yeah, that's moreyour style!

I have ulterior motives, ofcourse.
I'll do anything to get a girl's attention.

But I...

Allen, right? I don't mind.

I always get what I want.

<i>Anyway...</i> Instead ofthat, maybe
you could do something for me.

This is my father's final logbook.
The one from his study.

This is it!

Is something like that really useful?

It sure is!

This may solve the mystery
that's at the heart ofall this.

Mystery?

Atlantis.

Atlantis?

My old man used to tell me
about howyour father...

...was searching for the
secret treasure ofAtlantis.

I'm gonna borrow this for a bit.

The man's a <i>celebrity...</i>

He's embarrassing me,
even out in this frontier.

It's a bargain compared to what
he paid to repair Escaflowne.

You're right, ofcourse.

Why did I have to
go and say that?

Now he must think I'm some
kind ofgroupie or something...

Hitomi?

Millerna?

Um, I was wondering ifI could ask
your opinion about a friend ofmine.

Sure.

She has a boyfriend,

but she found out that he's really a
playboy, and he even fathered a child.

What ajerk!

just listen until I'm through.

Sorry.

But this girl met another man
who's rich and seems really nice...

...and even told her
that he loved her.

Talk about obvious... Moron.

And?

What doyou think she should do?

What she should <i>do?</i>

IfI found out that he had a kid
while I was going out with him,

I'd never talk to him again.

Why not?

Well, he's a disgrace
to men everywhere.

It's like he'd go out with <i>anybody.</i>

But he's a wonderful man...

Isn't the other guy, too?

I guess he's pretty good looking.

And he'd give her love
and money, right?

Then I'd say she should go with <i>him.</i>

But that's so calculated...

What ifshe did what the guy is doing
and went out with both ofthem?

That's so immoral!

Or she could give up on both.
She could be the tragic heroine!

You'rejoking!
Don't make fun of--

Anyway, what about the feelings
she already has for one ofthem?

Yeah, I guess that's a problem

I guess it's most natural
to go with your feelings.

Your feelings...

I could do a reading.

You know, to see which
one is best for her.

I'm pretty accurate when
it's for somebody else.

Areyou stupid or something?
Who cares aboutyour readings?

Beforeyou do a reading
for somebody else,

try sorting outyour
<i>own</i> feelings first!

My own feelings?

Who doyou like?
Van orAllen?

Who's it gonna be?

Allen's... the one that I like.

I'm just... worried... about Van.

<i>"Worried"?Is thatreallyall?</i>

Then stay away from Van!

Allen's out ofyour league.

I don't get it.

That's it, isn't it, Sister?

I can't believe we
ran into them here...

Must be our luck.

Let's go introduce ourselves and
get a present for Lord Folken.

Sounds good.

...but then my old lady found us.

just wasn'tyour day, I guess.

<i>There'sa Guymelefcalled</i>
<i>"Escaflowne"here, right?</i>

Send it out.

<i>Ifyoudon'tdo asyou're told...</i>

...you're all dead.

Boss! It's Zaibach!
Zaibach's Guymelefs are here!

What?!

Van!

Don't! You shouldn't
try to pilot ityet!

Lord Van!

Here goes...

Van went out?

There it is.

Let's take it out.

A woman?

His stomach's wide open!

What's with him?

He's scared.

Dilandau's group got
taken out by <i>this</i> guy?

<i>He'sbeenareal</i>
<i>disappointment to LordFolken.</i>

<i>Let's finishhim off..</i>

I won't letyou kill him!

I won't letyou kill Lord Van!

Merle...

<i>Whatapartypooper.</i>

<i>Iknow whatyoumean.</i>
<i>Butstill, she</i> is <i>a cat.</i>

<i>That's enough fortoday.</i>

Merle!

Merle.

Lord Van...

Lord Van!

Thank goodness you're safe!
Thank goodness, Lord Van...

Merle...

<i>Merle.</i>

I've got it! I've <i>got</i> it!

just as I thought, all the mysteries
lie in the Mystic Valley!

The Mystic Valley?

The legendary place where the
Draconians are said to live.

Blue searchlights meet
beyond the Moon...

Yeah, my angel who came
flying down, who areyou?

The doors ofdestiny are
opening before us,

<i>solet'sjustfallin love.</i>

I can't break free ofthis moment
that's making my heart flutter...
