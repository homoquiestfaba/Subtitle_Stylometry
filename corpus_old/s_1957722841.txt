The future.

What's the future gonna be?

[girl 1] <i>Freedom.</i>

[window opening]

Oh, y'all in here kissing again, huh?

[girl 2] Shut up, Abe.

[girl 1] I told you
to stop climbing through my window,

'cause if Mommy catch you,
I'mma get a beating.

You're the only one she ain't gonna beat.

Mommy slapped
the shit out of me last week.


It's 'cause you told her to go to hell.
You deserved it.

[girl 2] She tells your father
to go to hell all the time.

She's grown. She can do that.

Beauty's grown too.

As long as we live in this house,
we children.

And children must honor...


It's in the Bible. You gotta do it.

If we did everything the Bible say,
we'd live in a pretty messed-up world.

Bible is kinda fucked-up.


Hey, Beauty, your voice.

Mmm, I'll be fine.

Switch with me.

Why you always want what I got?

'Cause my nerves are bad.

[Abel chuckles]

What?

[girl 2] I don't know why,
you don't do shit.

She ain't never had
a hard day's work in her life.


Mommy makes me practice
for six hours a day,

and she yells at me the whole time.

That's work.

That ain't shit.

[Abel, girl 2 chuckle]

Both of y'all can shut the fuck up.

[girl 2] You know you love us.

[gospel music playing in the background]

Right now, I don't.

Beauty! Abel!

Get your asses down here right now!
Your father's home!


Jas, you could come.

She ain't call my name.
[Abel] Don't worry. I'll protect you.

You always say that,

and when she starts giving me
the evil eye, you don't do shit.

I was about to drop your ass.

Shut your dumb ass up.

Nigga, you wasn't about to do shit.

I don't worship no devil.
You don't worship God.

I wouldn't touch that thing

Do you?

Then I'mma talk to her myself.

You can't make

I'mma ask the woman in

Yes, she does. You taught her well.

Let the woman talk.

The torch has to be passed to someone,

and I believe
that someone is your daughter.

[Mother scoffs]

That's the same thing
she said to me ten years ago.

And I was telling the truth.

It's just that
I think you were ahead of your time.

And Beauty's not?

No. Beauty is right on schedule.

It's easy.

<i>A blind man could tell you

<i>It takes somebody who knows what to do...</i>

<i>I can promise you you're never gonnaÂ have

You want
what's best for your bank account.

Don't make me smack you
in front of this white woman.

Should I step out?

Give you two a minute?

Please.

What can I do

to make you know that I have
Beauty's best interests at heart?

You can wait.

A few more years.

I'm ready now.

You don't know what's out there.

The... the record industry is the devil,

and he's just waiting to swallow you up.


what they do to stars, huh?

They build you up

Can't nobody tear me down, Mommy.

You taught me to keep my head high

and to put God first.

Go to your damn room.

Why?

Go to your room or be dragged.

It's your choice.

Listen to your mama.

Go!

Go on, now.

She ain't ready.

Trust me.

She's ready.

[jazz music continues]

No.

I am not sending her out in the world

'Cause she came out of my body.

Okay.

That's gonna work. [chuckles]

That's gonna work.

Yeah.

Hey, Daddy.
[chuckles] Hey, daughter.

Can you hand me that rag over there?


What you doing up so early?

I couldn't sleep.

Ah.

For sure, you got a lot on your mind.

Hey, get in the car. Try to turn it on.

I just wish I could hold on to you

I'm not going anywhere.

When you sign that contract,
everything's gonna change.

Watching you sign that contract

probably be
the hardest thing I ever have to do.

It's not easy for a father... [inhales]

into the world.

Maybe I shouldn't sign it.

<i>â™ª And I want you to come on... â™ª</i>

You will.

Jasmine and I were talking...

She's not your family.

I am.

You don't sign that contract,

You live your life, and I'll live mine.

You really think you can trust him?

Of course I can.

He's my father.

You gonna sign the contract or not?

I think so.

I'm scared.

Of what?

What's gonna happen to us?

Your life's gonna get real big real fast.

It's gonna be like
a freight train you can't stop.

Yeah, but you'll be on that train with me.

What if I want my own train?

My train will be a lot nicer.

Whatever.

It's not about you being careful.

Okay?

It's about you

You will end up

Hmm?

Folk gon' wanna know

And that ain't how none of this work.

What did you say?

Nothing.


You are sheltered, and you're spoiled.

Spoiled?

We ain't got no money.

We have spent our whole lives

When you walk out on that stage,
we can't come with you.

I don't want you to.

So who gonna do it, then?

Jasmine?

Yeah.


The world ain't ready for that.

Ready for what?

We're friends. That's it.

That's because God's your only friend.

I didn't say that.

Why didn't you say it back?

'Cause I want you to leave.

[song fades out]


[both chuckle]

What do you say

to the criticism you've been getting
from your Black audience?


Well, some people say
that you're pandering to a white audience

and that you don't want
your music to sound too

"soulful."

Is that your plan?

[woman whispers] Stay in character.
No, I'm asking you a question.

Is that your plan?

No.

Oh no.

No, we... we are gonna first appeal
to the urban audience.

What you mean "first"?


that Black women are going to love.

Also, that white teenage girls
are gonna go crazy over

and play over and over and over again.

That way,
you'll get both sides of the market.

And if you do that,

you will be an icon.

Trust me.

Now, I'd like you
to answer the question that I ask you,

and I'd like you
to do it in proper English.

I... I don't know how
to sing in Black, white...

I just know how to sing,
because that's what I like to do.

Good.

All right.

[clears throat]

You have
a lot of love songs on your album.

When you're singing those songs,

who are you singing them to?

Everybody.

[woman sighs]

Let's just go with the answer we prepared.

Why do I have to do this?

Because you cannot just be a singing star.

You, Beauty, have to be the whole package.

There are a lot of little...

little girls

who need someone to look up to.


If you wanna be a star...

you're gonna have to wear a mask.

Okay.

Yeah.

Let's answer the question
as it was prepared.

Okay?

Okay.

I haven't found that special someone yet.

Okay.

But when I'm singing those love songs,

I'm thinking about what <i>he</i> could be.

Great.

Really.

Really, it was great.

Okay?

It was great.

["Get Down" byÂ Gene Chandler playing]


This is it.

Yeah, this is the one.

[blow-dryer whirring]

<i>â™ª We are, mama, gonna snake and boogie... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, get on down... â™ª</i>

You look beautiful, babe.

Um, please don't say that in public.

Just wait for when we're
at the house, okay?

This is all still
a lot for us to get used to.

<i>â™ª Get on down
Get down, baby... â™ª</i>

I don't care what you do at home.

Just when we're out and about,
we have a certain image to maintain.

We or me?

I just want what's best for you.

I know what's best for me.

[woman sighs]

Why don't you try on
one of the long, black, flowing ones?

Why can't I just rock my own hair?


that little Black girls
like long, flowing hair.

Maybe that's because people like you

always tell them that's the only way
they can be beautiful.

I don't make the rules.

Yes, you do.

You sure you don't wanna try a long one?

<i>â™ª Get down, baby bubba
Baby, get down â™ª</i>

[blow-dryer whirring]


No. Actually, I like the short, curly one.


and let's take a look at it first.

Ooh, ah, ah, ah, let's go.

And a... [scats]

Turn around.

And dip the hip. Ah!

Turn and dip and move that hip. Okay!

One more time. Let's go. And...



Turn around, and...


Oh, okay. You know what?

Let's take five.

Good? Let's take five.

[choreographer sighs]

I never met a Black person
who couldn't dance before.

What she gotta dance for?

Every pop star dances.

She ain't every pop star.
Just keep the steps simple.

She can join up for some of those,
and then the complicated stuff,

she can be out front
doing one of her long runs.

I'm down if she is.

She will be.

Trust me, she hates this shit.

["Sudden Inspiration"
by Mohammad Reza Mortazavi playing]


She's like a racehorse.



I don't give a fuck what it is.
Don't be calling my girl no horse.

[man] Okay.
I like the music here.


Do we have the words to give you?
Can we do that on the stand?

It's right here. I just...
[woman] Okay.

It's my brain.

but is there a way...

No, I'm good.

[indistinct chattering]


[euphoric music playing]

I need some amazing vocalists behind her.

Yeah.
[man] Um...

Who do you have in mind?

[whispers indistinctly]
No.


Okay.

A mirror.

And I see your...

I see your change.

Okay. That's not good.
[chuckles] No.

Okay.

Wrong side.

Just play the song.

can you turn it down, please?

People trying to sleep.

I'm sorry.

I've been living here two whole years.
Been quiet as shit.

Teenagers move in,
and I haven't had a peaceful night since.

You motherfuckers always playing
music loud, giggling and shit.

I'm not a teenager.
[scoffs]

Well, you sure do look like one.

That's because
you haven't seen me with my clothes off.

[gentle music playing]


Listen, just, uh...
just try to keep it down, okay?

I'll try.


Who was that?

Who was at the door?

Some guy.

You were talking to him a long time.

Relax, he just wanted me
to turn the music down.

I'm surprised you didn't cuss his ass out.

I wasn't in the mood to cuss his ass out.

You always in the mood
to cuss somebody out.

I'm trying to be nice.

Nice? Since when?

singing someone else's song.

I wanna sing my own music.

what you're singing.

What they care about
is that you are a young, beautiful woman

with a voice of an angel.


"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

I don't wanna sing that.

Trust me.

That song is wholesome,
and Irv's audience knows that.

You mean white people know it.

Fine.

Okay.

Well, why don't you take this?

See if you can learn something.

Take these and see

[Cain sighs]


Daddy's sick.

What you mean?

He had a heart attack.

How come Mommy didn't call me?

She tried.

You ain't been home.

Where is he now?

He's at Saint Michael's
on the fifth floor.

He's been asking for you.

[elevator dings]


[Father breathing raggedly]

Hey, daughter.

How you feeling?

Hey, I've been better.

You know,

I'm sorry
I didn't come earlier to visit you. I...

I didn't know you were sick.

How's the album coming?

Really good.

[groans softly]

[Father breathes deeply]

They said they have to open me up,

work on my heart.

What's wrong with it?

Not getting enough blood or something.

That's from eating all that pork.
[chuckles]

I know you ain't talking.

You eat worse than me.

But I'm young. I can do all that.

[Father chuckles]

If I don't make it outta here...
Don't... don't say that.

Let me speak my piece, okay?

I've always been an ambitious man.

I got that from my father.

He had a hard life.

I think that's why I was so determined
to make something of myself.

I wanted my life to have meaning.

But after a while...

[chuckles softly]

...I realize I... have to settle

for just being the head of my house.

Shit.

I wasn't even good at that.

That's why it was so important

to me that you make it.

I thought, if you went far,

I would too.

I know.

for me to say this...

but I need you to give me my cut.

Cut of what?

that contract for you.

You know what? I'm not doing this.

a new apartment downtown.

[Father inhales]

I even heard
you bought your little girlfriend a car.

Yeah, and where'd you hear that?

You can't keep nothing from me.

Is that why you wanted to see me?

for you to pay me what you owe.

I don't owe you shit.

You owe me your whole life.

I used to think that.

But I don't anymore.


Just look at ya.

the business was gonna change you,

but you up in here acting all crazy,
and you ain't even had a hit record yet.

But one day, I will.

I'mma have a whole bunch of 'em.

And while I'm celebrating,
drinking champagne,

everybody will be there...

except for you.

Those the last words
you wanna say to your father?

Is that how you want me to remember you?

I have a gift.

See you after the show.

[Irv talking indistinctly]
[woman laughs]

[audience laughing]

Why is he here?

Relax.
No. Don't tell me to relax.

I just wanted him
to come and hear me sing.

Why?

'Cause I told him I was a good singer,
and he didn't believe me.

Is that the only reason you invited him?

Yes.

When this is all over...

I wanna hear applauding is you.

I would applaud for you
