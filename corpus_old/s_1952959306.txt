Christmas decorations.     

Sentimental.           

Good, you found her.       

Wait, don't take her out yet.           

Wait for me.           

Ok, but I get to put       
the wings on this year.    

Oh, no.            

She's much too delicate.    

Delicate.           

<i>I was ten that year,</i>      

<i>And never before had</i>      
<i>Christmas come so slowly.</i>     

<i>My dream was that Santa</i>    
<i>would bring me a bicycle.</i>     

Hey, mom, I'll be back in a while.        

Bobby said I can ride his bike.         

<i>My parents had insisted</i>    

<i>That I could not have</i>     
<i>one until I was 10,</i>       

<i>Old enough to ride</i>        
<i>safely, they said.</i>        

<i>And here I was,</i>        
<i>months past 10,</i>        

<i>And still no bike.</i>        

Jerry, wait!           

We're taking the        
bike to get it fixed!      

<i>But with a bicycle,</i>       

<i>I'd pointed out many</i>      
<i>times to my parents,</i>      

<i>I could get a paper</i>       
<i>route of my own.</i>       

The problem is, the chain   
comes off and you can't stop.  

Happens all the time.      

<i>If I could get such a route</i>   
<i>and build it up, I told them,</i> 

<i>I could make</i>          
<i>$10 or $12 a week.</i>        

<i>Big money for an</i>       
<i>11-year-old in Thomasville.</i>   

[ gasp ]            

[ crash ]           

Ahh!               

[ breaking glass ]         

Jerry!             

Are you all right?         

Jerry.             

<i>1950 was also the first time</i>  
<i>that I saw Jimmy black,</i>    

<i>Soon to be called Whitey by us</i>       

<i>Because of his hair.</i>      

<i>Whitey was new to Thomasville.</i>        

<i>He lived in a shabby</i>      
<i>rental house next to</i>      
<i>some railroad tracks</i>      

<i>With his mom</i>          
<i>and sister Sandy.</i>         

<i>Mrs. Barnes was the den </i>        
<i>mother of cub scout pack 101.</i>       

<i>She had a sweet smile,</i>    
<i>a good disposition,</i>       

<i>And a powerful hankering</i>   
<i>to perform good deeds.</i>    

[ knocking ]           

Hello.             


Oh, look. The cub scouts.   

We thought you might
need some things.       

Oh...              

Well that was very         
thoughtful of you.         

Jimmy, come out here       
and help your mama.        

Don't y'all look cute in your uniforms.       

[ laughing ]           

Aren't they cute?       

Jimmy, look.           

Aren't they nice?       

They brought us some things.   

Hello, sweetheart.         

What's your name?       

Sandy.             

Oh, that's a pretty name.   

She's a little shy.        

Thank you.             

Brought you some books.    

Look there.            

It's an Angel book.        

What do you say        
to the nice lady?       

Thank you.             

You're welcome.        

Would y'all like a         
cookie or something?       

No, we've got to be going.           

We've got a lot of         
other stops to make.       

Ok. Well bye-bye.       

Let's go read our new book.          

<i>Whitey's shame, humiliation and </i>        
<i>resentment was so obvious,</i>        

<i>That I knew instantly that</i>    
<i>if I ever felt the urge</i>    
<i>to commit Charity again,</i>   

<i>It would be from a distance...</i>

<i>And anonymously.</i>       

<i>I didn't see Whitey very much</i>       
<i>until later that spring</i>         

<i>When he showed up at the</i>   
<i>tribune looking for a job.</i>    

Show him how to do inserts.    

Don't do that again.       

Do what?            

You know what.         

Keep it moving, boys.      

I didn't do nothin'.       

Hey! Hey!           

Stop it! Stop it!       

What's your problem?       

We're not going to have    
any fighting around here.   

Well he started it.        

I did not.             

What is this all about?    

He hit me.             

I didn't either.        

Don't look at me.       

We are not going to have any of
that rowdy stuff around here.  

You two boys need to       
apologize to each other.    

Go ahead.           

[ mumbling ]           

What?              

Sorry. Sorry. 

Now shake hands.        

Do it.             

That's better.         

Now I want to tell         
you boys something.        

Next week,             

I'm going to have an opening
on a paper route here.       

And if you two think       
you can get along,         

I'd consider letting you share it.          

What do you think of that?         

Sure, I can get along with him.        

Me, too.            

Good.              

Now y'all get back to work.          

You, too.           

How about we make a bet?            

If I make it back it back here first,        

You have to give me        
that baseball glove.       

[ laughs ]             

Ain't no way you're        
getting this glove.        

[ spits ]           

All right, then what do we bet?        

Hum...             

Whoever makes it back last     

owes the other one a       
cheerwine at Roudabush's.   

Deal.              

[ horns blow ]         

Ahh. Same bet tomorrow?    

I don't know.          

How come?           

Well, I got nine more houses
on my route than you do.           

Then you should have plenty    
of money to by me another   
cheerwine tomorrow.        

Where you goin'?        

I got things to do.        

What kind of things?       

Like, none of your         
dern business things.      

For a hard workin' paper boy.  

On the house.          

Thank you.             

[ laughing ]
you're welcome.   

[ radio: ] Well, binky, it seems   
like that old buzzard Chonkey  
is going to jail after all.    

Well, binky, it seems like     
that old buzzard Chonkey    
is going to jail after all.    

Mom, could you tell        
him to shut up?        

He ruins it every time.    

[ radio: ] Get you in a heap    
of trouble this time.      

Get you in a heap of       
trouble this time.         

I think it's cute.         

[ gun noises ]         

Dad.               

Boys, please. I'm trying to read.        

[ gun noises ]         

[ gun noises ]         

Oh.                

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

[ loud thump ]         

[ man and woman arguing ]   

Jimmy, look what I found.   

Isn't she beautiful?       

Hey, this is just       
like your new book.        

I've got an idea.       

There we go.           

Now she can look over      
you when I'm not here.     

Jimmy, would you do        
one more thing for me?     

Sure.              

Once upon a time - oh      
many, many years ago       

As time is calculated by men - 

But which was only yesterday   

In the celestial calendar of Heaven,        

there was, in paradise,    

a most miserable,       
thoroughly unhappy,        

and utterly dejected cherub    

who was known throughout Heaven

as The Littlest Angel.     

He was exactly four years,     

six months, five days,     

seven hours and        
42 minutes of age       

when he presented himself   
to the venerable gatekeeper    

and waited for admittance   

to the glorious kingdom of God.        

[ bee buzzing ]        

[ burp ]            

[ laughing ]           

<i>It was full-blown Summer now</i>

<i>hot as blazes during the day</i>         

<i>and just perfect at night.</i>    

<i>Whitey and I became</i>       
<i>best friends,</i>         

<i>and every day after we</i>    
<i>finished our paper route,</i>     

<i>we'd meet Randy and Let and</i>   
<i>Billy down at the fort.</i>    

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

[ car engine rumbles ]     

[ boys laughing and talking ]  

Oh, that was really        
fun last night.        

Yeah.              

Uh, who's there?        

Is that you, boy?       

Who's this?            

This is just my friend, Jerry. 

We was just going       
back to my room.        

Y'all don't make no noise.     

Who was that?          

My mama's boyfriend.       

I hate being here alone when   
he's the only one in the house.

Think you can stay         
'til my mom gets back?     

Sure.              

What's it like         
living with that man.      

You sure do ask a       
lot of questions.       

He's a drunk, and he's mean.         

What else is there?        

Where's your real daddy?    

Oh, I'm sorry.         

You don't have         
to talk about it.       

Hey, captain America.      
He's my favorite.       

He's dead.             

Huh?               

Dead.              

My daddy's dead.        

How'd he die?          

Mama says it was a car     
crash when I was 6.        

Do you remember him at all?            

A little.           

All I know is we weren't    
so poor back then.         

I saw him...           

One time.           

You mean, like a        
ghost or something?        

Well, it was sort       
of like a dream.        

He came to me and told me
everything was gonna be all right,        

With mom and all.       

Was it scary?          

No, he's my dad.        

The only thing that        
is scary about it is...    

I ain't never seen him again.        

It's kinda hard for        
me to talk about it.       

Come on. I want to         
show you something.        

Where is she?          

Mama probably took her to the  
county health department.   

Sandy isn't feelin' too good.  

What's wrong?          

Different things.       


That's one of the reasons   
why we left South Carolina.    

She loves angels.       

I've noticed.          

She likes for me to read    
this to her all the time.   

We checked out every       
single book on angels      
down at the library,       

But this one's her favorite.   

[ woman's voice ] <i>it took</i>   
<i>us two hours before we</i>    
<i>could even see a doctor.</i>   

You know, I better be going.         

Oh, I didn't know       
you were home.         

Mom, this is           
my friend Jerry.        

Hi Mrs. Black.         

Hi Jerry. This is Sandy.
Can you say hey?    

Hey.               

Did y'all have fun last night?        

Yeah. I did.           

Yeah.              

Good.              

Well y'all hungry?         

You want me to fix         
you something to eat?      

I better be going.         

Mom's probably wondering    
where I am by now.         

See you at the paper.      

Ok.                

Bye.               

Blessing.           

Lord, make us truly grateful   
for all thy many blessings.    

For Christ's sake. Amen.    

Amen.              

Pass me that yard buzzard.     

I'm ready for some cookies.    

Not until you've eaten     
everything on your plate.   

How was your campout       
last night, honey?         

Fine.              

What'd you do?         

Nothing.            

Did you stay up late?      

I don't know.          

Well, what'd you talk about?   

All kinds of stuff.        

Like what?             

Like Randy Clark said he's     
getting a Schwann black phantom.

Daddy, I really, really want one.        

Son, I make $45 a week!    

With that, I've gotta pay for  

All the food on this table,    

Clothes on your back,      

And keep your mama         
in the lap of luxury.      

Now I don't know how much   
one of them bikes costs,    

But I know it's too much.   

It can't be!           

Money don't grow on trees.     

Now I don't wanna hear no   
more about no dadgum bike!     

Daddy, all them army trucks... 

All those army trucks.     

All those army trucks,     
where are they going?      

I think they're setting up some
sort of camp outside of town.  

Nobody really knows.       

Probably just routine maneuvers.         

There's something goin'    
around, isn't there?       

They're here because       
people are gettin' sick.    

Everything's gonna         
be just fine.          

The school sent        
home a letter today        

Saying they're gonna have   
a new trial vaccine        

For the kids to        
try out this fall.         

Does that mean I've        
gotta take a shot?         

I ain't takin' no shot.    

You'll eat your supper,    

And you'll take a shot     
if I say you take a shot,   

Or else you'll end up like     
them boys in lake hickory.     

Jack!              

Sorry.             

Eat up.            

You can't even put food    
on the table anymore,      

And you're drinking up     
what little we do have!    

You're lucky what       
I do give you!         

You give me nothing,       

And you're nothing!        

You're a bum!          

And you made us all sick!   

I want you out of here!    

Get out! Get out        
     and leave us alone!        

Leave us in peace!         

Just leave us be!       

Look at all this candy.    

Want some?             

Your daddy gonna catch you.    

Not if I...            

See all you gotta do       
is open up the flap.       

There they are,        
ready for taking.       

Nobody will ever miss one.     

You're the luckiest kid I know.

Movie:             
Ladies and gentlemen,      

This is the third year that you
have allowed me to bring here,       

Into your theater,         
for a moment's visit,      

Some of the children you    
are helping in their fight     

Against that dreaded       
enemy of happy childhood,   

Infantile paralysis.       

I should like to show you   
that, without your help,    

Hundreds of children would     
be helpless cripples today.    

In the western part        
of North Carolina,         

Right near the great smokeys,  

 Lies the little        
town of hickory.        

Last June...           

Ladies and gentlemen...    

Hey, what about us?        

I'm sorry,             

But I've just been         
informed by the authorities    

That the movie theater's now   
closed until further notice.   

What?              

How come you're        
getting shut down?         

All I can say is        
that the authorities       

Have said no large         
gatherings in Thomasville...   

And that includes       
the movie theater.         

I'm sorry.             

Man, the show was       
just getting' good.        

I wonder what's going on.   

Maybe the guy hasn't       
paid his rent?         

Maybe the place has got rats.  

Hey!               

I bet it's got something to    
do with all that army action.  

You think so?          

I don't know, but       
something sure is going on.    

He's right.            
This ain't normal.         

Maybe Martians are         
about to invade us.        

Whoa.              

Maybe we're about to       
be invaded by commies.     

Commies?                        

Commies?

Only one way to find out.   

Man, this is great.        

Who's on my team?       

Not me.            

Ok, go on over to that tent,   

And Billy and Let       
have to go over there.     

Oh, man, that's way        
on the other side.         

Yeah.              

Ok, we'll take that one.    

What happens if we get caught? 

It's the army. What        
are they gonna do?         

Let's go.           

Besides, we're with the paper. 

Ok.                

All right, now meet us back    
here after you get the flag.   

Ok, go, go, go.        

Sergeant, can I get your    
signature on these papers?     

Sure, here you go.         

Whitey.            

Whitey.            

The kid from           
the football team...       

The Sagersons' kid?        

Yeah, the sick         
one, the older one.        

The one who's not gonna    
make it if he coughs       
again without that mask.    

We took it off         
because of the heat...     

[ gasping ]            

[ talking ]            

Now ladies and gentlemen, if I 
may have your attention please.

We are at the beginning    
stages of what might become    
a serious polio epidemic.   

Is it contagious?       

No ma'am, as far as        
we know it is not.         

As far as you know?        

Ma'am, could you        
please take a seat?        

Shouldn't you quarantine    
this camp of yours?        

Or the whole county?       

Please ladies, one at a time.  

This is not yet a       
quarantine situation.      

Why?               

Because nobody,        

Not even the best       
doctors in the country,    

Know exactly how this      
disease is spread.         

So to start a massive quarantine
right now would be futile.     

We'd have to           
quarantine everybody,      

And then, by definition, it    
would no longer be a quarantine.

Now, this camp has been    
set up to deal with this    
emergency situation,       

And to handle the overflow     
from area hospitals that    
are badly overcrowded.     

But Colonel Brandeis, if it's  
not dangerous, then why are    
you keeping it such a secret?  

Crowd jeers.           

Excuse me, we had a        
well-coordinated plan      

To inform the community about  
exactly what was going on   

Until that plan was        
derailed this afternoon.    

Well I want to know why we     
weren't told about this earlier.

Because these things have to   
be handled carefully, ma'am.   

I've seen situations like   
this turn into an unnecessary  

Generalized panic, and     
that was our only concern.     

Concern? You don't seem very   
concerned about my family.     

Rose! Sit down and be quiet.   

Well, I will.          

But it's going to be       
far away from him.         

His sister's got the polio     
so bad she can't even walk.    

It's true!             

I don't want my        
children around it.        

We don't know anything     
about this disease.        

How it's spread. Come on!   

Whitey says not        
everybody can get it.      

You have to be         
suspecticle to it.         

[ laughing ]           

Ladies and gentlemen,      
we have informational      
pamphlets for each of you.     

If we have             
additional information,    

We will broadcast it over   
your local radio stations.     

That is all.           

Listen, mom wants to see if    
you could start delivering     
the paper to our house now.    

That's Whitey's route.     

I know.            

He ain't doing a good job?     

No, his sister's got the polio,

Which means...         

Ain't nothing wrong with Whitey.           

Which means he's        
touching the newspapers    
that end up in our house.   

So?                

You should see it. Mom doesn't 
even open them anymore.    

She picks 'em up with      
the fireplace tongs        

And throws the darn        
things into the fire.      

That's crazy.          

Why is that crazy?         

Do you know how        
polio's spread?        

Well, do you?          

Not exactly.           

Mamma says it's a       
hot weather disease.       

You're safe in the winter.     

But come summertime...     

I would watch out.         

What else did she say?     

She said it comes from     
flies, spoiled food        

and dirty bathrooms.       

Stuff like that.        

You ever been          
to Let's house?        

No.                

I'd watch out for him,     
too, if I was you.         

Come on.            

Come on nothing.        

Just because you can't see     
there ain't nothing wrong with 
him don't mean he ain't got it.

Get out.            

Do you know what        
polio does to you?         

Yeah.              

Liar.              

What does it do?        

Um, well, um...        

Contact.            

It's like a germ.       

You can get it if you touch    
someone who's got the polio,   

Or if you kiss them,       

Or if they sneeze on you.   

Swimming holes?        

You don't catch me going into  
any pools, creeks or ponds.    

What about drinking a      
drink after somebody?      

Absolutely.            

Probably just breathing the    
same air they're breathing.    

Let me tell you, this      
germ gets in you, and it    
goes straight to work.     

It's like a snake.         

It gets in your spine...    

And it crawls up        
to your brain.         

It's a hungry snake.       

It starts eating your brain.   

Soon you get bad headaches.    

Then you can't walk,       

And then you find yourself     
flat on your back...       

Paralyzed.             

Last but not least,        
you can't breathe.         

Wanna know what happens next?  

Look, Randy, I gotta go.    

I'm running late.       

All right, but talk Whitey     
into swapping paper routes.    

I'll tell ya, mom       
is scared to death.        

Going down. Going...       

Army one, I'm going        
down! I'm going down!      

[ radio changing stations ]    

Jimmy, I forgot a lot      
of this fraction stuff,    

But I think you're supposed    
to get a common denominator?   

Is that it?            

Yeah. It says          
something about that...    

[ glass breaking ]         

[ car engine ]         

Who was that?          

Otis?              

Mean people.           
Just mean people.       

Let's get ready        
for bed now, ok?        

Don't you worry about      
Otis, all right?        

He's gone. He's gone       
for good. He ain't never    
coming back in here.       

All right?             

What are we gonna do mama?     

I don't know.          

I don't know, but I ain't   
leavin' here again.        

And they can throw every    
rock in the county         
through that window,       

But we ain't leavin'.      

But what about Sandy?      

She don't know         
nothin' about it.       

Besides, she won't have to put 
up with anything much longer.  

What does that mean?       

Is somethin' else the matter?  

You go on now and       
read to your sister.       

Ok?                

Mama just needs        
a little time.         

I just need            
a little time alone.       

Mama..             

You're always alone.       

[ cries ]           

Hey boys, it says       
here Santa's gonna come    
ridin' into Thomasville    

On top of the new fire truck.  

What do y'all think of that?   

Oh great.           

Wow.               

I already know what        
I'm getting'           
everybody for Christmas.    

Do y'all?           

Yeah, what are you getting'    
your sister, Whitey?       

I don't know.          

She wants an Angel doll,    

But I can't find one nowhere.  

Did you try Belks?         

Yeah, Belks should have one.   

Nope, they don't.       

Get out.            

[ groaning ]           

You boys quit yakkin'      
and get back to work.      

After your route, me and    
Jerry will help you find one.

Here you go.           

Here you go.           

Here you go.           

No, I'm saving up for      
a Christmas present.       

That's a good idea. Good.   

It hardly makes any sense.     

It's Christmastime.        

You'd think at least one store 
would have an Angel doll.   

We looked at every shop in     
town for that dang thing,   

And I don't know        
what else we can do.       

I ain't givin' up.         

That's all I know.         

How about that weird       
little antique store       
way down on hill street?    

That's a good idea.        

We'll check that out next.     

Hey, uh, can I         
have a sip of that?        

No, you know, I have a     
sore throat comin' on.     

I wouldn't want you to     
catch it or anything.      

I don't care. Just         
give me some.          

Thanks.            

Y'all hear that the Holly   
festival Queen is gonna be in  
 the parade again this year?    

Whew.              

Good.              

Now, wait a minute.        
Wait just minute.       

It's a pretty big deal to   
have the Holly festival Queen  
ride in our Christmas parade.  

Sure it is.            

Who cares?             

If you guys are        
so smart, how come you     
can't find an Angel doll?   

Ever occur to you to buy a     
regular doll and fix it up     
to look like an Angel doll?    

Now there's an idea.       

You're dern tootin'        
there's an idea.        

That's great, Mr. Roudabush.   

Come on y'all. Let's go.    

Come on Jerry.         

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

[ cheering and whistling ]     

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

The phantom!           

Will you hurry up?         

There she is.          

What?              

That's Sandy's Angel doll.     

Where?             

That... That big one.       

I see it.           

Mr. Roudabush was right.    

She's not an Angel doll    
yet, but she will be.      

â™ª â™ª oh what fun it is to ride â™ª â™ª        

â™ª â™ª in a one horse open sleigh. â™ª â™ª         

Mom, we've got         
something to ask you.      

What is it, son?        

Y'all can come         
up on the porch.        

They don't bite.        

That's ok son.         

What can I do for you?     

Go ahead scardy cat.       

See, I always read this    
book to my sister Sandy,    
"The Littlest Angel."      

She loves angels, and I looked 
in the sears catalog and they  
didn't have one either,    

So I figured nobody        
had one in town,        

And then at the parade we   
went to Belks, and they    
didn't have one either,    

And they have trinkets,    
pictures, ornaments, you    
know, stuff I didn't want,     

You know, even pictures.    

But Sandy wants this       
doll, and she's sick,      

And sears didn't have one,     
and Let and Jerry helped me,   

And then on the way back    
by the five and dime,      

She was there with         
all these other dolls.     

I mean, it was her,        
but only it wasn't her,    

You know, it was        
her but not exactly,       

Because she didn't have    
anything like wings        

Or anything like        
a halo or anything.        

But it was her.        
I found her.           

The Angel doll at       
the five and dime.         

What he's trying to say    

Is can you help him        
make an Angel doll         

Out of this regular doll    
we saw in the window       
at the five and dime?      

No, what he wants       
to know is,            

Will you make          
a doll for Sandy?       

Well I don't see        
why we couldn't.        

Well great. Great.         
Sandy's got her doll. See?     

But, wait a minute.        

 What would you charge me?   

Well, the money's not the   
important thing here.      

I want to pay.         

Ok, we can             
work something out.        

Thanks Mrs. Pearl.         

I can't thank you enough.   

Come on y'all. Let's go in.    

We've got some cookies.    

So, you finally        
decided to come home?      

Well, I've just gotta go    
back to my room for a minute.  

Then we've gotta go finish     
collecting from our route,     

And I've just got a couple of  
other things I need to do.     

Well, I need you to be doing   
some things around here, too.  

Mom, I've got to do        
this. I can do whatever    
you want me to do later.    

Aren't we the busy beaver?     

Could you not          
watch me please?        

Please?            

Face the door, and         
close your eyes.        

Are your eyes closed?      

Yes.               

Ok, good.           

Ok, you can            
turn around now.        

Thanks a lot.          

My best friend         
doesn't even trust me.     

How much is that?       

Ten dollars.           

Is that enough?        

More. The doll costs $8.99,    

And with tax, it's only $9.18.        

You ready?             

Yeah. Come on, let's go.           

You know what...        

Maybe you might want       
to go on in there       

And tell your sister a little bit
about he parade, huh?        

I'll wait outside.         

Bye.               

She's asleep.          

She ain't gettin'       
no better, is she?         

Can't wait 'til baseball season.        

Me, too.            

Come on, Let.          

[ laughing ]           

Here he comes.         

Boys, we've got a lot      
of papers to fold.         

Whitey!            

Whitey, what's the matter?     

I lost my money.        

 What money?            

You know, the money        
I had in my glove.         

The money I was gonna      
use to get that doll.      

Maybe we can still find it.    

But I've looked everywhere.    

Ok, how did you lose it then?  

I don't know. It just      
fell out, I guess.         

I reached in to check on    
it, and it wasn't there.    

Well then where were       
you when it happened?      

I was leaving          
Mrs. Bell's house.         

Well that's where       
we've gotta start.         

Come on, let's         
retrace every step.        

[ thunder ]            

Hey, Whitey!           

I'm sorry.             

I won't be able to         
get that doll now.         

And that means Sandy...    

Don't worry. It'll turn up.    

Whitey, it's getting dark soon.             

My mom's probably       
wondering where I am.      

We better call         
it a day, ok?          

[ sigh ]            

Look, you heard        
what everybody said.       

If they found it,       
they'll let you know.      

They promised.         

I need a flashlight.       

My daddy's got a couple.    

Come on, boys. Let's go.    

Come on Whitey.        

I'm stayin'.           

I'll work my way back home,    
but I ain't givin' up yet.     

Tell you what,         

I'll make another pass by   
here in about 30 minutes.   

If you're still here,      
I'm taking you home.       

Ok. Good night.        

Is he gonna be all right?   

Yeah.              

Whitey, he's a tough kid.   

One way or another,        

It'll all work out for the best.       

Let's go home.         

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  

Where do you           
think you're going?        

Oh, I told Mr. Parker I'd   
help him deliver and stack     
firewood this afternoon.    

Oh no you don't.        

I don't want           
you going anywhere.        

But mama, I told        
him I'd help him.       

No!                

Why not?            

Because I need you         
here to help me.        

I'm tired.             

Mama...            

Mama nothin'!          

I've got to do this.       

I've got to earn some      
extra money so I can get    
Sandy that Angel doll.     

That ain't important.      

Now you do what I say.     

Yes ma'am. I'll just       
tell him I can't make it.   

That's right.          

They cut it off yesterday.     

That's fine.           

Hey.               

What you writing?       

I'm supposed to do a paper     
for Mrs. Jenna's class     
about president Roosevelt.     

Oh, really?            

You know, he had polio.    

Look what he did.       

Hey mom?            

Mmm hmm?            

How come Randy Clark       
is gettin' so mean?        

Mean?              

What makes you say that?    

Well, he's just not very    
nice to Whitey or Let.     

Is he mean to you?         

No, he thinks I'm his friend.  

Are you?            

I'm not sure anymore.      

Why not?            

I don't now. It's just...   

He's so much like his mom.     

They're both always        
complaining about everything.  

Well, like a lot of people     
right now, she's scared.    

About the polio?        

Yep.               

She's scared of Let?       

That's different.       

How come?           

Honey, there's a difference    
between being scared       

And just not...        

Understanding.         

What's the difference?     

Ok...              

When people come        
from different places      
or backgrounds...       

Sometimes...           

They just don't understand.    

Sometimes they just        
don't want to understand.   

But when people are sick,   

Especially with        
something like polio,      

That we don't know         
anything about,        

It's easy to get scared.    

 But he's mean to Let, too.     

And Let's not sick.        

Nobody in his          
family has polio.       

Uh, let me try to       
explain it this way.       

You know your uncle Bill?   

Says all them bad       
words you don't like.      

Yes, all those bad words.   

Well, he's like Mrs. Clark.    

On the other           
hand, your daddy...        

He don't cuss.         

Right, he doesn't cuss.    

He chooses not to.         

So the difference is...    

Daddy chooses not       
to be scared.          

Exactly!            

Your daddy ain't...        

Oh...              

Isn't scared.          

So then I don't need to    
be scared about playing    
with Whitey and Let?       

They're your           
friends, aren't they?      

Yes ma'am.             

Well there's your answer then. 

Hey, mom?           

Mmm hmm?            

You ain't scared neither?   

Not a lick.            

Now eat your sandwich.     

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

[ door opens ]         

<i>I'll take her.</i>        

[ knocking ]           

I found it! I found it!    

What in blue blazes is that?   

I found it!            

Oh, Whitey, that's wonderful!  

Well, where on earth       
did you find it?        

It was really strange.     

You now, sometimes         
when I can't sleep,        

I like to play catch.      

When I was putting my glove    
on, there was something in it. 

I have no idea         
how it got there.       

I mean, it was the         
last time I saw it,        

And then it was gone,      

And suddenly it came back.     

It was almost like         
somebody...Like an Angel or    
something put it in there.     

Where is it now?        

It's right here.        

You don't have a hole      
in that pocket, do you?    

No ma'am. I checked.       

Why don't you sit down     
and have some oatmeal?     

Oh, no, I'm fine. I can't   
eat. I'm too excited.      
I gotta go get that doll.   

Just sit down, let Jerry    
finish his breakfast,      

And then in a minute,      
y'all can go down       
to the five and dime.      

Yeah, sit down, Whitey.    

Come on Jerry.         

Thanks anyway, Mrs. Barlow.    

Oh!                

[ humming ]            

Uh, excuse me.         

Yes?               

There was a doll in the    
window the other day.      

It had on a pink dress.    

Yes, that was the only     
one we had like that.      

Oh, did somebody buy it?    

I'm not sure.          

See, a lady came by yesterday  
morning to look at it,     

And we took it out of      
the window for her.        

I thought she might        
come back for it,       

So I stuck it          
under the counter.         

But I didn't           
work last night,        

So I don't know if         
she came or not.        

You know, somebody         
else might have got it.    

Well, could you look?      

Sure.              

I want to buy it.       

She's expensive.        

Oh, don't worry.        
I've got the money.        

She sure is a pretty thing.    

Somebody's gonna be awfully    
happy this Christmas.      

I know she is.         

Here you go.           

[ cash register ringing ]   

Hey y'all.             

You know, you          
could say hey.         

Hey.               

[ laughing ]           

Here comes trouble.        

Where y'all been?       

We just dropped the        
doll off at Let's house.    

That's great.          

I know everybody's         
gonna be happy.        

Whitey, y'all got yourself     
a Christmas tree yet?      

No, not yet.           

I don't know what my       
mama was planning to do.    

You wanna come with us?    

Yeah, we're going right now.   

Ok. Sure.           

All right. Watch your fingers.          

Hey Larry! Let's go,       
cowboy. We're moving out.   

Hon, we'll see you         
in a couple shakes.        

<i>Bye.</i>              

<i>Bye, mom.</i>             

[ engine starts]        

Everybody in?          

[ knocking ]           

[ knocking ]           

Hello?             

Can I help you.        

 Oh, hi.            

Yeah, hi.           

I'm...Mary Barlow.         

Jerry's mom.           

I'm Fronia.            

It's nice to meet you.     

Nice to meet you.       

I... I'm sorry.         

Would you like to come in?            

Thank you.             

Here, sit down.        

Ok.                

Thanks.            

Can I get you something    
hot to drink?          

No, no, I'm fine.       

Do you have any idea       
where the boys are?        

Oh, they're with Jack.     

He's my husband.        

They went out in the country   
to find some Christmas trees.  

That's nice.           

I hope he's not in the way.    

Oh heavens no. No!         

Jerry and Jack         
wanted him to go.       

I bet he'll bring you a    
Christmas tree to boot.    

Jerry's a good boy.        

He's a real good friend.    

We really enjoy Whitey.    

And he told us         
all about Sandy.        

Would you like         
to meet her?           

I'd love to.           

Come on.            

She's in here.         

Sandy...            

Oh, she's sleepin'.        

She is so Precious.        

Look at all her angels.    

They bring her Joy.        

Well, in fact, that's      
really why I'm here.       

Jerry talked our choir     
director into changing the     
Christmas pageant this year.   

So...              

Instead of doing the nativity, 

They're gonna do        
The Littlest Angel.        

Oh.                

The littlest Angel?        

Mmm hmm.            

And, uh, we would like to   
invite you and your family     
to come and see it with us.    

We'd love to go.        

Well, great!           

So, uh, we'll...We'll      
pick you up at         
4 o'clock on the 24th.     

Ok.                

Uh...              

Sandy's really beautiful.   

Thank you for thinking of us.        

 Yeah.              

Bye.               

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

Mama!              

[ knocking ]           

Come in.            

Oh hi, boys.           

Hi Mrs. Pearl.         

Wow!               

It looks just like an Angel.         

Oh, so I didn't do         
so bad after all?       

Oh no ma'am. You did fine.     

She's beautiful.        

How much do I owe you?     

Well, let's see.        

It didn't take much time    
after I figured out what to do 
with the halo and the wings.   

So, oh I don't know...     

19 dollars.            

[ laughing ]           

Whitey, child,         
you need to relax.         

One dollar. One dollar     
will cover my expenses.    

Is that too much?       

No, no ma'am.          
One dollar's fine.         

Are you sure that's enough?    

That's plenty.         

Could you do one more      
huge favor for me?         

Talk to me.            

Do you think you could keep    
her 'til Christmas morning?    

I want this to be a        
big surprise for Sandy.    

Are you kidding? I wouldn't    
mind keeping her at all.    

As a matter of fact,       
I've gotten used        
to having her around.      

Me, too.            

I'll be back with the drinks.        

There she is.          

They ain't coming.         

Thank you.             

Come here.             

Oh.                

Look how handsome you look.    

Why don't you go?       

I just wanted          
all of us to go.        

Oh, I know.            

Sandy's sick, sweetheart,   
and mommy's gotta stay     
here and take care of her.     

I just thought Sandy       
would really enjoy         
seeing the pageant.        

She...             

She wants you to go.       

I want you to go.       

Please.            

Would you go for both of us?        

Ok.                

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

Mama...            

The littlest Angel, he's the   
same age as me, isn't he?   

Yes he is, sweetheart.     

Want mommy to read to you?     

[ clapping ]           

Good evening.          

I want to thank you all for    
coming this Christmas Eve.     

We have what I think will be        

An event filled with       
Joy and the hope of        
the Christmas season.      

Now when little Jerry      
Barlow came to me,         

I was at first worried     
that changing the pageant   
wouldn't be possible.      

But after hearing the story,   

I knew it was the       
right thing to do.         

So, without further ado,    
I'd like to invite the     
first Methodist church     

To watch The Littlest Angel.   

[ clapping ]           

This time, I'm gonna       
tell you a story mama.     

Ok, baby.           

Once upon a time - oh      
many, many years ago, time     
is calculated by men -     

There was in paradise,     
a most miserable,       

Thoroughly unhappy         

And utterly dejected cherub,   

Who was known throughout    
Heaven as The Littlest Angel.  

He was exactly four        
years, six months,         

Five days, seven hours     
and 42 minutes of age      

When he presented himself   
to the venerable gatekeeper    

And waited for admittance to   
the glorious kingdom of God.   

And waited for admittance to   
the glorious kingdom of God!   

[ crowd laughs ]        

The littlest Angel         
soon became the despair    
of all heavenly hosts.     

Yes, and on top of that,    

He inevitably and       
vociferously sang off key   

At the singing practices    
of the heavenly choir.     

<i>[ boys sings off key ]</i>    
<i>â™ª â™ª once in royal</i>        
<i>David's city â™ª â™ª</i>        

<i>â™ª â™ª stood a lowly cattle shed â™ª â™ª</i> 

<i>â™ª â™ª where a mother â™ª â™ª</i>        

<i>â™ª â™ª laid her baby â™ª â™ª</i>         

<i>â™ª â™ª in a manager for his bed â™ª â™ª</i>  

<i>[ laughing ]</i>          

<i>â™ª â™ª Mary was the mother mild â™ª â™ª</i>  

<i>â™ª â™ª Jesus Christ â™ª â™ª</i>       

<i>%% her little child. %%</i>     

<i>â™ª â™ª he came down to</i>         
<i>earth from Heaven, â™ª â™ª</i>      

<i>â™ª â™ª who is God</i>          
<i>and Lord of all â™ª â™ª</i>         

The time came that         
Jesus, the son of God,     

Was to be born of       
Mary in Bethlehem.         

The angels and archangels,     

The seraphim and cherubim,     

The gatekeeper, the wingmaker, 

And yes, even the halosmith,   

Put aside their usual tasks    

To prepare their gifts     
for the blessed Infant.    

What could he give that    
would be most acceptable    
to the son of God?         

What, oh what,         

Could a small Angel give    

That would please       
the holy Infant?        

<i>â™ª â™ª he was little,</i>       
<i>weak and helpless, â™ª â™ª</i>      

<i>â™ª â™ª tears and smiles</i>        
<i>like us he knew â™ª â™ª</i>         

What would you give him?    

I would give...        

My life for you.        

My baseball glove.         

What would you give him?    

My book.            

There was a breathless pause,       

And then, the          
rough unsightly box of the     
littlest Angel began to glow   

With a bright, unearthly light.

Earthly eyes, blinded      
too by its splendor,       

Could never know that      
the lowly gift         
of The Littlest Angel      

Was what all men        
would call forever         

The shining star of Bethlehem. 

Mama, will I be a Angel?            

You already are one.       

<i>â™ª â™ª amen. â™ª â™ª</i>             

[ clapping ]           

[ whistling ]          

Shhhhh.            

Present for Santa.         

Merry Christmas.        

Merry Christmas to you.    

Hey Larry.             

Shut up, Jerry. Go to sleep.   

Larry.             

What do you want?       

I don't think I'm gettin' it.  

What?              

The bike, I don't       
think I'm gettin' it.      

How come?           

Well, I'm usually pretty    
good at finding        
mom and dad's presents,    

But not this year.         

See a bike is too big      
to fit inside the house,    

And I checked the       
trunk of the car,       

And dad's truck is full.    

I don't know where they    
might've hidden it.        

Which can only         
mean one thing...       

I'm not gettin'        
a bike this year.       

I guess a bike is       
pretty expensive.       

Do you know how much a     
Schwann Black Phantom costs?   

No.                

Neither do I, but       
I know it's a lot.         

Maybe I should         
get another job.        

If I was real careful      
about what I spent         
and saved my money,        

Maybe then I'd get to buy   
myself a bike by next Summer.  

A used one, of course.     

I could fix it up and things.  

Think I should         
get another job?        

Larry?             

Jerry!             

Wake up.            

He's been! He's been!      

Come on!            

Look! I got            
a lone ranger set!         

Shhh.              

You got it. You got it!    

Is a J.C. Higgins       
the same thing as a        
Schwinn Black Phantom?     

No, a Schwinn is        
built by Schwinn,       

And J.C. Higgins        
is built by sears.         

But didn't you want a      
Schwinn Black Phantom.     

It doesn't matter. This    
is perfect, just perfect.   

Isn't she a beauty?        

Yeah.              

<i>You boys get back to bed.</i>     

[ shooting sounds ]        

Come here cowboy.       

Stick 'em up.          

Make sure you put       
that jacket on.        

Where are you going?       

You haven't even opened    
your grandma's present.    

You can open it, Larry.    

It's just some socks.      

Be careful!            

Hey Randy!             

Dang it, Jerry, you scared    
the dickens out of me.     

You know, I can't say      
for sure about         
everything you told me,    

But you were dead wrong    
about Whitey and Let.      

They are both my friends,   
and always will be.        

And you know something else?   

You are not big enough     
to get on that bike.       

[ crash ]           

Is Whitey home?        

He's not here.         

Do you know where he is?    

Son, this ain't a good day.    

He ran off a while ago.    

We ain't seen him since.    

I bet I know where he is.           

Don't worry.           
I'll find him.         

If you find him,        
send him home.         

His mama's worried         
sick about him.        

Hey, Whitey!           

Hey, Whitey!           

[ door squeaks open ]      

Whitey, what's wrong?      

Sandy died.            

When?              

Last night.            

We took her            
to the hospital,        

But they couldn't       
do nothing.            

She told me,           

The angels was comin'.     

She could see 'em.         

She said, "look, Jimmy. Look."       

But I couldn't see nothin'.           

And then,           

After a little while, he just...            

Breathed away.         

Her book's gone.        

I searched all over,       
but I can't find it.       

I wanted to take it to     
the funeral home, but      

It's not in            
the house no more.         

Hey,               

I... I got a bike.       

Do you wanna ride it?      

No...              

I'm just gonna walk for    
a little bit right now.    

I've gotta try to help     
mama after a while.        

She's not doin' too good.   

[ door shuts ]         

Tell Let's mama she        
can take that doll and     

Give it to whoever can use it.        

And you might wanna        
tell her to put them       
old clothes back on her.    

Nobody else'll probably    
want a dumb old Angel.     

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

[ whistle blows ]       

Well, you got your wish.    
Your own paper route.      

What do you mean        
my own paper route?        

Whitey ain't comin' back, son.       

What do you mean?       

I mean, he's gone.         

He's left town.        

Him and his mama took      
off for South Carolina.    

To bury the little girl, I reckon.        

Sooner or later,        

Everybody loses a       
friend in their life.      

See you tomorrow.       

<i>If Whitey had ever</i>        
<i>come back,</i>            

<i>He didn't</i>             
<i>let anybody know.</i>         

<i>I kept thinking I'd hear</i>   
<i>from him somehow.</i>         

<i>A letter, something.</i>      

<i>But I never did.</i>       

<i>[ thump ]</i>             

<i>Nobody would've guessed it,</i>           

<i>But I went out</i>        
<i>into the world</i>        

<i>And became a</i>          
<i>successful writer.</i>        

<i>When I published</i>       
<i>my first book,</i>        

<i>Some relatives and</i>        
<i>a few friends</i>         

<i>Showed up at a book signing.</i>        

<i>In the small</i>          
<i>crowd was a lady</i>       

<i>Whose face was</i>        
<i>vaguely familiar.</i>         

Mrs. Pearl?            

[ laughs ]             

Everybody in town       
is so proud of you.        

How are you?           

How's Joe and Let?         

Oh, Joe died some years ago.        

But Let's still        
over at the factory.       

He's a foreman now.        

I'm mostly alone except for    
Let and my grandchildren.   

Well please tell Let I     
said hello, would you?     

I certainly will.       

I've got something for you.    

It's a present.        

Excuse me.             

For me?            

Whitey never came back for it.           

I kept thinking that       
he would, but he never did.    

I never could find out where they
moved so I could send it to him.      

I've kept it all these years.        

Never opened it.        

Never.             

Except right here in this box.           

Nearly drove Let crazy...   

But it just didn't seem right      
to open, I don't think.         

I thought you would want it.         

Thank you.             

<i>My son Kyle was 10 then.</i>   

<i>He got his first</i>       
<i>bike that year,</i>        

<i>And we started what is</i>    
<i>now a yearly tradition...</i>     

<i>Placing the Angel</i>         
<i>doll next to our tree.</i>    

<i>Recently, while away</i>      
<i>at a conference,</i>       

<i>A young couple came in and</i>    
<i>sat at a table near me.</i>    

<i>They had their</i>        
<i>daughter with them.</i>       

<i>She was four or five.</i>     

We need to get to ST.      
Jude's by about 10 o'clock.    

Thank you.             

<i>Anyway, I hadn't paid any</i>     
<i>attention to them,</i>        

<i>When I noticed the little</i>     
<i>girl was clinging to a doll.</i>  

<i>It was smaller,</i>        

<i>But as I looked,</i>       

<i>I saw it was a perfect</i>    
<i>replica of the doll I knew.</i>   

<i>I feel better now.</i>        

<i>I think the doctors are gonna</i> 
<i>take really good care of her.</i> 

<i>The doctors and my Angel.</i>     

<i>That's right.</i>         

<i>You're my little</i>       
<i>Angel, aren't you?</i>        

[ â™ª â™ª ]              

Excuse me.             

The dolls, where        
do they come from?         

I wish I could tell you, but we
don't have the faintest idea.  

It's been going on for years,  
even before I came here.    

Somebody just sends        
them every December        

With instructions to give one  
to every child who wants one.  

And you know, we        
always have enough.        

Thank you.             

I think I know         
who that might be.         

Hi.                             

Hi.

That's a pretty doll.      

Thanks.            

Hi.                             

Hey.

She looks just like me.    

She sure does.         

<i>I even try finding</i>        
<i>Whitey sometimes.</i>         

<i>In a given town, I'll</i>     
<i>search the phone directory</i>    
<i>for anyone named black,</i>    

<i>And even call a few.</i>      

<i>But none acknowledge ever</i>     
<i>living in Thomasville.</i>    

<i>I soon realized that</i>      
<i>even if I find Whitey,</i>    

<i>I wouldn't know</i>        
<i>what to say.</i>          

<i>I feel that it's enough to</i>    
<i>know that he's out there,</i>     

<i>And that' he's</i>        
<i>obviously doing well,</i>     

<i>And that he, as I,</i>        

<i>Learned from our</i>       
<i>experience so long ago,</i>    

<i>That the gift of Christmas</i>    
<i>is the gift of love.</i>      

<i>And every year since then,</i>    

<i>My family gathers</i>         
<i>to open presents and</i>      
<i>experience the Miracle...</i>     

The littlest Angel...      

<i>And if it's ever looked</i>    
<i>upon as an ordeal,</i>        

<i>We have all tolerated it for</i>  
<i>the sake of a foolish and</i>     
<i>softhearted man named Jerry.</i>  

<i>So every year after I call</i>    
<i>the hospital and find out</i>     
<i>that the dolls have arrived,</i>  

<i>I know it's time</i>       
<i>to fetch the tree</i>         

<i>And bring down the box marked</i> 
<i>"Christmas, sentimental."</i>     

<i>Linda finishes her work,</i>   

<i>I put the doll</i>        
<i>beside the tree,</i>       

<i>And we offer</i>          
<i>this little wish:</i>         

<i>"Merry Christmas,</i>         
<i>Whitey old friend.</i>        

<i>Some day I may come</i>       
<i>looking for you.</i>       

<i>But in the mean time, may</i>     
<i>she ever bring you love.</i>
