Every so often I dream of
my brother's face on fire.

In that darkness,
I'm eleven again.

An age before I knew
the color of money.

Before I learned to lie and cheat.

And before I learned how to win.

Back then, my life was
school, food and games.

Oat.

Where's your brother?
Probably outside.

Go get him.
It's time to eat.

After our dad died,
his sister became our new guardian.

To help out, my brother quit
school and started working.

Hey, Oat.
What's up, Jai?

What do you want?

Auntie said to come eat.

Damn it.

Don't touch my bike.

It's my bike, too.

It's yours when you learn to ride it.

I can't learn if you never teach me.

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

Want to stay for dinner?
Sure.

Jai was Ek's boyfriend.

They'd been together since high school.

Jai was richer.

Taller.

And whiter.

He was everything Ek wasn't.

They lived in different worlds.

What Ek saw as white,
Jai saw as black.

What Ek heard as music.

Jai felt as noise.

I think that's what kept
them together for so long.

Despite what others said.

Oat, stop it.
What?

Hello, Auntie.
Can Jai stay for dinner?

Thank you.

Only vegetables again?

You're more than welcome
to bring in your own food.

This arrived for you today.

Draft Lottery Notification

Ow, Kwan!

You act like you're four years old.

If you're gonna play with your food
then don't eat.

Oat, where are you going?

I'm not hungry.

My poor baby.
Are you hurt?

Our father didn't leave us much.

Just debt on this house
and the old bike.

Hurry up, son.

My mom died before
I got to know her.

Luckily, my dad was
always there for us.

Dad, I want to try that one.

Try your luck at fish scooping.

Here you go.
5 tries for 20 baht.

Take it easy, kid.

That's too bad.

That's okay.
Here's a new one.

Let your Dad try one time.

Catch a lot.
Hand me that bucket.

Watch this.

The trick is to let it float first.

Dad, get the big one.

That one.

The blue one.
That's the big one.

A construction worker fell from
the 22nd floor of a construction site.

The site is a new condominium
right in the heart of Bangkok.

Hungry?

Not really.

Want to play checkers?

Okay. Where's Jai?

Went home.

Ek. You going out tonight?

Why do you care?
Can I go?

No way.

But last time you promised.

I said, I'd take you out if you beat me.
You got to win first.

Hurry up.

Hold on.

Here's good.

Thank you.

I win, again.

We never heard Kwan come or go.

She just appeared
and then was gone.

What the hell?

Ek didn't masturbate for weeks after that.

Clean this up.

But I didn't do it!

I don't care.
Clean it up.

Stupid chicken.

Ek did his best to take care of me.

For my birthday,
he knew exactly what I wanted.

You hungry?

Welcome to Big Burger.

One hamburger set, please.

Double cheese set.

What?
Double cheese set.

The double cheese set, please.

One double cheese set.
That'll be 169 baht.

You're not ordering anything?
I ate already.

Hey.

That's Thung.
But everyone called him Junior.

His father ran the black market.

The black market lottery,
the Muay Thai fights,

The black market everything.

Junior's dad owned everything
in the neighborhood.

He owned the buildings,
the restaurants, the shops.

He even owned our house.

Excuse me,
your double cheeseburger is ready.

Your double cheeseburger is ready.

Welcome to Big Burger.

Want some?
I can't eat this by myself.

Eat up, kid.
It's your birthday.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

That was the first time I tasted cheese.

I remember it smelling like a dead fish.

Rotting in the garbage.

Oh, you pussy.

Dude blew some chunks.

I'm sorry.
Come on. Get up!

That's the last time I'm taking you out.

The draft is next week.

Are you ready for it?

Auntie, it's a lottery.
How can I prepare for a lottery?

You prepare your mind and you pray.

Pray for what?

Pray for black.

Auntie was probably
the most superstitious person I knew.

She released fish every
week for good karma.

It never really seemed to help her though.

Oh my God!

I'm serious.
What if you get drafted?

You'll be gone for two years.
Who will take care of Oat?

I can't take care of two kids myself.

Well, what do you want me to do?

Why don't you go talk with Junior's dad?

Maybe he can help you.

Why would he help me?
All I do is work at his bar.

Then show him how valuable you are.

You hear Jong is
volunteering for the draft?

Dumbass.

At least he can go home early.
It's going to be so long.

Think of all the guys that'll be there.

How many numbers do you think I'll get?

Hey.
Haven't you already had enough?

Kitty was not your average girl.

She wasn't your average boy either.

Hi, Kitty.

Hi, Kitty.

You slut.

You're just jealous
I get all the guys.

That's because you like getting fucked.

Some guys ask to be fucked, too.

Can you imagine Kitty with a rifle?

Actually, I can.
What's so funny?

Jai!
Yes?

Can you come down here?
Okay.

Can I play?
No.

Hey.

Where are you going?

What, I can't go to the bathroom?

We have always depended
on your good graces.

I'll take care of it.

I have a son so I know how you feel.

You have nothing to worry about.
Just have Jai show up at the lottery.

It's not a lot, but please accept this.

Your son, there are so many
other useful things he can do.

Okay, please excuse me.

At 11:40am, there was an explosion
on the road in the South.

One solider was killed in the incident.

Police found three explosive devices
at the scene.

Ek?
Yeah?

Did you talk to Junior's dad about the draft?

Why do you care?
I'm just asking.

I heard if you bribe him,
he'll help you out.

Well, even if it were true,

We ain't got no money
to bribe him with.

Ready?
No.

Let's go.
I'm not ready.

Stop it.
I'm not ready!

I told you I wasn't ready!

You want some?

A new method of making methamphetamine
is becoming more popular.

Hey, look who it is.

Come here.

Give me that.

Want some?
No.

Just try it.

No!
Your brother does it all the time.

I don't want to.

Want more?

Hey! Oat?

Junior.
Leave him alone.

We were just playing.

Playing, my ass.

Come on, Oat.

Where're you going?

You bitch.

Fuck off!

Before you get fucked in the ass.

I think she likes me.

Are you hurt?
No.

What were you doing there anyways?

It's a shortcut home.

Shortcut?

Well, don't come here alone anymore.
It's dangerous.

You understand?

Are you going to tell Ek?

Not if you don't want me to.

Then I won't.

Let's go.

Oat.

Can you watch Kwan
for a couple of hours?

I have to go clean a house.

Why do I have to watch her?

Why do I have to watch you?

Kwan, be a good girl.
Mommy will be right back.

Bye bye.

Go! Go! Go!

Oat! Kwan!

What are you doing?

We're releasing animals for...

You brat!

Look at the house!

I've been cleaning houses all day.

And now I come home
to clean another one.

Breaking that statue
will give us bad luck.

Get inside.
Now!

Where did you get this?

Do you know how dangerous drugs are?

It's not a drug.
It's just a popper.

You think I'm stupid?

Tell me where you got it.

It's not mine.
It's Jai's.

I knew it.

You knew what?

Ek.

You can date any guy you want.

But trust me.

Relationships like you
and Jai don't work out.

You're only going to get hurt.

Remember when we first came here?

Yeah, and you tried to kiss me?

No, you tried to kiss me.

That was so long ago.
We were still in school.

You think we'll still be together,
if one of us gets drafted?

Of course.
Why would that matter?

What if I get red?

What's going to happen to Oat?

If you pick red,
and get drafted,

I can take care of him.

Yeah, but what if you get red.

And get drafted, too.

How to Win at Checkers
(Every Time)

In the game of checkers,
every move counts.

To win, you must always be
two steps ahead of your opponent.

Let's start with the first rule of checkers.

Rule #1: Look before you leap.

Give it back!

Stop it!

Rule #2: The best defense
is a good offense.

You know my dad's on my back.

You better be glad I came here
instead of my dad.

Understand?

Junior, you don't have to do that.

How long do you need then?

Just give me a few more days.

Rule #3: If you at first
don't succeed, try, try again.

Oat?
What are you doing in there?

Go give this to Auntie.

What's wrong?
Were you crying again?

No, dust got into my eyes.

Why are you so sensitive?

I said I wasn't crying.

What's that?

I brought it for you.

Grilled chicken?

Help me pass these out.

Who is it?

Come in.

Afternoon, sir.
Hey, sport.

What is it?

Can you help my brother?

Who?

Ekkachai Rattanaram.
He works for you.

Ekkachai?
Oh yeah.

The bartender boy?

How can I help him?

Can you help him in the draft?

Where did you get this?

My Aunt told me to give it to you.

Do you know what I do to
people who steal from me?

Do you know what I do to
people who steal from me?

No, please.
I only did it for Ek.

What do you mean
you did it for Ek?

You think saying sorry is enough?

What are you going to do about this?

If you were me,
what would you do?

From now on,
you go work upstairs.

Get out.

What happened?

It's taken care of.
Nice work, bro.

Damn it.

Don't do that again.

I was doing this for you.

Who asked you?

Stealing isn't going to
get you anywhere in life.

It'll only cause more problems.
You understand?

Are you still angry at him?

He's just a kid.
Exactly.

He needs to grow up.

But if it you were him,
wouldn't you try to do something, too?

No, I wouldn't.

But you said yourself,
you were worried about him.

What does that have to do with bribing?

Come back here.

What did I do wrong?

Just come here.
What for?

Try to start it up.

Really?

Look here.

Just like that.

Let's go for a ride.

Okay.

Now shift up to second gear.

Pull the clutch.

I said shift up.

Come on.

Got it?
Now speed it up.

Okay, slow it down.

That's enough, stop.

What's wrong?

You can't go out there.
Where would you go?

This is stupid.

You know what's stupid?

You can't even start the bike
and you want to go out?

Move.

Get up.
Jai's here already.

Wear these.
And this watch, too.

What is this?
I borrowed it from a friend.

It's fake.
But don't tell anybody that.

Do I have to wear it?

Today's an important day.
It's better if you look good.

Auntie.
No one else is going to dress up.

Wear it.
Just listen to me.

Ek.

Be sure to give this to them.

"Death certificate:
Mr. And Mrs. Rattanaram"

Stop it!
I'll do it myself.

I'll be at the temple by noon.

And take Oat with you.

Oat.
Let's go.

Bye, Auntie.

Think black.
That's what we want.

Go sit over there.

Hey Ek.

Hey Kitty.

Sexy.
You, too.

Please stand for the national anthem.

Thailand unites its people
with flesh and blood.

Land of Thailand belongs to the Thais.

It has long maintained its sovereignty.

For the Thais seek love and unity.

Thai are peace-loving,
but fight with courage.

No tyrant can take away their freedoms.

Sacrificing every drop of blood for the nation.

Long last the nation's pride and victory.

Good morning, everybody.

By law, every male turning twenty-one
must participate in the draft lottery.

The registration will begin soon.
So wait for your name to be called.

Hey. Want to go celebrate after this?

What did Junior want?
Nothing.

Let's wait over there.

Number 158.

What's this?
Just give me your ID.

Number 159.

Number 160.

95-98.
Pass.

Number 137.

182 cm.

99.
Pass.

Number 293.

178 cm.

90-93.
Pass.

Everyone take off your shirts.

Stand up.

Palms up.

Fatso!

Squat down.

Stand up.

You...

No need to draw.
You can go home.

Next line, take off your shirts.

Stand up.

Take a step closer.

Did you have your operation already?
Not yet.

What about hormone pills?
Two years.

Okay, go over to line two.

I don't need to draw?
No need.

Palms up.

Excuse me.
Sorry, excuse me.

Where is Ek?

Today, we've been performing
our duty as individuals.

There are a total of 120 cards.

35 of them are red.

Whether you draw red or black.

Totally depends on your luck and nothing else.

But those who pick red,
are actually the luckiest ones.

Lucky, my ass.

Because you can serve your country.

When I call your name,
step up to the front.

Open your hand in the air before you pick.

Then wait until we read out the card.

Everyone understand?
Yes sir.

Okay, we will now start the lottery.

Rattawut Lapcharoensap.

Red! Red! Red!

Black!

Siwakorn Rodcheow.

The Navy welcomes the new recruit.

It's red!

Phummitad Lertrungwichien.

Red! Red! Red!

Black!

Brother Atipat Kwanjan.

Red, little buddy!

Black!

Sarawut Pitak.

Black!

Porramet Shumnuan.

Black!

Ekkachai Rattanaram.

Red!
To the army!

The rest of the lottery was
like a dream to me now.

I don't remember much at all.

It's going to be okay.

When the boys in the back
of the line went to the front,

They pulled out black card.

After black card.

Nuttawut Yuyingchareon.

Like magicians pulling rabbits out of a hat.

Black!

Lerd Ritkajorn Sombat.

Black!

Ek, wait up.

Ek, please.

I promise I won't bother you.
I'll sit in the corner by myself.

Come on, please?

Go set up the checkers board.

Ek, go!

Hold on.

That was dumb.

Did you learn anything from that book?

That's called the
"Stupid Buffalo" trap.

Damn.

Oat.
Yes

Come up here.
Okay.

I won.
Winning, my ass.

Oat.

While Ek is in the army,
you better not eat any meat.

Why?

You have no respect for the gods.

Auntie.
He can eat whatever he wants.

I'm going to take him out with me tonight.

Really?

To where?

Ice-skating.

Oh right, ice-skating.
I love ice-skating.

Go get ready.

When you get back we need to talk.

About what to do while
you're in the army.

I'll send you money, don't worry.

Like your army paycheck
will make a difference.

Oat! Stop that!

Give me that.
Go get ready.

Ice-skating, I love ice-skating.

Eat shit, Ek.

Do you want to go or not?
Just hurry up.

I can't believe I beat you!

You didn't win.
I still had one piece left.

This is where you work?

Feel free to go home.

You go home.

Then stop complaining.

Hey. You came.

Kitty, what are you doing here?

I work here.
What are you doing here?

Hey, what's with the babysitting?

I couldn't leave him home alone.

Hey kid. You hungry?

Want a cheeseburger?

No, thanks.

Just pretend he's not here.

Can you keep your eyes to yourself?

Hey, little buddy.

Tell you something.

Be careful where you put your dick.

The AIDS might eat it up.

He's got no clue.

Who's the handsome boy?

My virgin brother.

That makes two of us.

It's getting to that time of the night.

Leaving already?

Don't worry.
I'll be back.

To give you what you want.

You stay here.
No, I'm coming with you.

Remember you lost.

Who's shaking it?

I shook it last time.

Want to shake it for us?

Give it to me.

That's enough.

Ek.

Stop it.
It's gonna explode.

Stop it.
It's going to explode.

See, it's done.

Out of all the desperate things
I would later learn to do,

I wonder why it's that dream

That haunts me over and over again.

Hey there, handsome.

That's my brother.

I know.
You told me already.

He's a little high.

I can see that.
What about you?

Nope.
Ever been?

Of course.
Plenty of times.

Hey!
Since when did you smoke?

Back when you were still a man.

That was cruel.

Good evening.

Hello.

Can we help you?

How much for him?

He's not working today.
How about another boy?

Art.
Come over here.

I don't want another boy.
I saw him working here last night.

How much for this one?

I like this one.

5,000 for the kid.

There's 5,000.

5,000?

5,000?
Okay, let's go.

That was just a joke.

If you aren't going to pay
then leave.

Fine.

Let's go.

Ek, what about Oat?

He'll be fine.

Right?
Yeah. I'm not a baby anymore.

You don't have to act
so tough all the time.

Tell you what,

I'm going to go upstairs for a bit.

Then I'll take you home.

Who's the kid?

Ek's little brother.

Oh, the one who broke
into Junior's dad's car?

Nice one.
You got some balls man.

Isn't that why Ek
started working upstairs?

Be quiet.

What?
What did I say?

Shut up.

I'm going to the bathroom.

What the hell you doing here?

I should kill you for being here.
Snap your fucking head off.

Ek! Ek!

Hey!

Let go of him.

Get him out of here.

You know he can't be up here.

Just go down!

You, okay?

Why are you doing this?

Is it because of me?

Not everything is about you, kid.

You'll understand when you grow up.

Alright, buddy?

See.
I told you he was working upstairs.

Jai.

What do you want?

It's not what you think.

How do you know what I'm thinking?

You had to do what you had to do.

So did I.

We live in different worlds.

I told you.

If you got drafted,

I'd take care of Oat.

No thanks.

Come on, Oat.

Let's go home.

Ek, wait up.

Going home already?

Let's put your kid brother in the dump.

Maybe next time.
What next time?

You drive.

Are you serious?
It's yours now.

If you say so.

Can you even start it up?

Are you sleeping, Ek?

Keep your eyes on the road.

Speed up.
What?

I said go faster.

Good. You've got it.

That was the first and last time
my brother took me out.

After Ek was drafted,
he was sent to the South on patrol.

They say that
when death comes for you,

There's nothing you can do to stop it.

A soldier was killed this
morning in the South.

This is the 7th fatal shooting this year.

At the funeral, the general told me,

I should be proud of Ek.

That he died serving our country.

That he had paid the ultimate sacrifice.

For the nation,

For religion,

And for the monarchy.

After Ek died, I threw
away all his things.

They reminded me of the fate
that was to become my own.

You hungry?

I told you I wasn't ready!

You want some?

That's called the
"Stupid Buffalo" trap.

Damn.

Take it easy.

Not everything is about you, kid.

You'll understand when you grow up.

Alright, buddy?

I learned at a very young age
how adults do business in this world.

Rule #4: Do whatever it takes to win.

Even if it means
someone else has to lose.

Black!

Urupong Rattanaram.

Black!
