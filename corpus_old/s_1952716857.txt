(Man breathing)

Man #2:
Have you thought about it?

(Clicks)
(reggae music playing)

Man #2:
l think you should.

(Clears throat)

What does she do there?

She's the assistant to the embalmer.

Oh no.

Something with the fluids.

No. (Chuckles)

Ugh.
No, man.

Lucy's training her
to sell seminars with Dr. Bob.

She calls the funeral directors--
phone sales.

Cool.

What's her name?
Connie.

So l'll tell Lucy it's on.
(Car approaches)

That's my uncle.
Don't mention it.

Man #2: Hey.
(Car door closes)

That it's-- you know.

Man #2: l won't. L won't.
Because he won't let it rest.

Man #2: Not a word.
That's how he is.

You two talking about me?
(Man laughs) No.

Only about the money we make you.

Uncle:
From your lips to God's ears.

Gentlemen.

Â¶ How can we sing King Alpha song... Â¶
(volume increases)

Â¶ ln a strange land? Â¶

Â¶ Sing it out loud... Â¶

Jack, would you

call yourself a Rastaman?

No.
You thinking of becoming one?

No.
(Both laugh)

l just wanted to ask.

You like the song?
Reggae's mainly positive.

Some of the words, you know,
l don't get, so it's hard to commit.

"Over l" is a hard one.

"Over l"?
Yeah.

We'll just order something
and hang out.

Yeah.
No biggie.

(Car starts)
Â¶ And the meditation of our heart Â¶

Â¶ Be acceptable in Thy sight... Â¶

(volume increases)

Â¶ Over l Â¶
Â¶ Sing it out, oh! Â¶

Â¶ We've got to sing it together... Â¶

(car starts)
Â¶ We've got to shout it together... Â¶

Hi, l'm Bob Thomas.

Hi, l'm Bob Thomas.

My great-grandfather started
as a cabinetmaker and undertaker

in the small town
of Pacerville, Oregon--

Lucy: Jack's a sweetheart.
My husband's known him a long time.

Do you like Chinese?
Yeah, l think.

We'll just order some.

Bob:
...a tradition for 125 years,

offering a supporting hand

into life's final transition.

Bob Thomas Mortuaries
is a humble partner...

(car honks)

(ltalian accent)
You drive long time?

Yeah.

You married?

No.

L practice my English.

Sorry.
That's okay.

(Acoustic guitar music playing)

Dressing for success.

That's right?
Yes, ma'am. Dress for success.

Dress for success.

Maybe shoes now.
Yes, ma'am.

Â¶ Stood by Â¶

Â¶ l stripped the sheets Â¶

Â¶ And emptied out the sty Â¶

(plane passes overhead)
Â¶ The crowds that light the carnival Â¶

Â¶ Are calling us Â¶
Â¶ Home Â¶

Â¶ Calling us Â¶
Â¶ Home Â¶

Â¶ Calling us Â¶
Â¶ Home... Â¶

Dress for success.

L'm sorry. You know,
to see your dad like that...

after not seeing him for a while.

The coma nurse said
when he gasped for air

his body did it in a reactive mode.

(Cork pops)
Oh.

That's... right?

Yeah.
"Like a dry pump"--

that's how he put it.

L was glad when he left
and l was alone with my dad.

(Men clear throats)

lt's good that he left because--

Yeah.
Yeah, l was glad he left.

Yup.
He was coming on to me.

The coma nurse?

Right there?
Yup.

Right there in the coma room?
That's not right.

He let his hand stay on my arm
without saying anything,

until my dad gasped

and then he left the coma room.

And my dad was right there--

in a coma, but still--

lt's not right.
No, that's-- no.

Ln a coma room
with your dad there...

in a coma, yeah, but still.

L'm fine.

Just getting your head around that--
Oh yeah.

(Clears throat)

My dad would gasp
and twist his body, you know.

L thought, "He wants
to get out of there," you know?

So when l was alone with my dad,
l told him, "lt's okay to go.

You don't have to stick around."
Yeah.

And l told him l loved him,
he was a great dad

and he was free to go to heaven.

Yeah.
Two days later

he woke up out of the coma.

Man: Fuck.
Oh, that's-- oh God.

Just woke up.

After three months.
Man: Fuck.

Yeah. He talked
in a softer voice, you know?

And l thought,
"Oh, well, he's in a zombie state

where you stay around because
there's some unfinished business

you're responsible for"--
like taking care of my mom.

Yeah, your mom. Of course.

He went back to be with her
at Village Care Facility.

Well, that's--

God. Lt's--

he got up from a coma, went home.

And then he fell down and hit his head
in the hallway and then he died.

Jack: God.

Lt's, uh--

it's kind of a--
A miracle.

Coming from a coma and then--

'Cause he wanted
to take care of your mom.

She was blind.

She couldn't walk, really.

She saw things
in the air near the end.

She was blind, but she'd look up
in the air like she was seeing them.

L don't know what.

ls the bathroom back there?
Yeah.

(Panicked breathing)

She needed to talk about it, l guess.

Yeah.
Lucy's gone awhile, right?

Yeah.
Probably didn't have Chunky Monkey,

so she's on a search.
Yeah.

(Doorbell buzzing)
Huh?


How many times do you think,
"Hey, they've been gone a long time,"

and then buzz?
You know, they're there.

(Buzzing repeatedly)
Jack: Yeah.

Man over intercom:
Yo, who is it?

Yo, me!
Me, l-never-forget-my-keys me?

No, buzz-me-fucking-in me.

(Lock clicks)

What?
Nothing.

(Panting)
(door opens)

Lucy:
Are you ready

for Chunky Monkey?
(Door closes)

Three delis. Where's Connie?

L'm here.

lt'll have to be warmer though.
Yeah.

Boating weather.
Yeah.

Are you sure you don't
want me to drive you?

Uh, no, it's really-- it's all right.

This is plenty.

Boating.

Yeah.

(Door opens)


(door closes)

(engine revs)

Lucy:
You like Connie?

We got along pretty well outside.

Man: Yeah?

Well, she said she'd like--
(clears throat)

she'd like to go boating.
Man: Boating?

Yeah, rowing in a boat
she said, you know?

To go boating...
(clears throat)

you know, sometime when--
(clears throat) fuck.

(Faucet runs)
So what did you say?

Maybe when it's warmer.
You made a date for summer?

Uh, no. L'm not, you know,

that bad to say "Let's do something
six months from now."

Lucy: He knows.
No, it-- it--

it started snowing
and it came up, you know?

The warm weather and summer.

Lf you're afraid, it's not a good idea.

L, uh, can't swim.

Man: l told you l'd teach you.
Lucy: He taught me.

You said it caused problems,
teaching someone you're close to,

so l thought--

l don't think so.

Lt was something else.
L just said it was the swimming lessons.

Lt wasn't the swimming lessons?

Man:
No. Come summer,

you'll go boating at night...

in the moonlight.

Huh? Huh?

Under the stars.

Yeah, l should learn, l guess.

We'll go uptown--
a pool in Harlem.

Beautiful pool.
Lt's heated?

L'm serious.
L'm serious.

Man:
lt'll get me back going.

L used to go three, four times a week.

Yeah.
(Kisses)

Thanks for everything. Yeah.

(Clicks)
(reggae music playing)

(door opens)

(door closes)

(acoustic guitar music playing)

Connie: Hi, l'm calling
from Dr. Bob's Grief Seminars.

The new seminar experience
offers techniques--

that's right.

(Lucy whispers)
Credit card.

--Violent acts,

the pain of sudden death--

l did?
Lucy: Credit card.

Mr. Pendecker.

He said to call back tomorrow.

Remember, it's "Hello,"
the opening,

"Give me the credit card."

The pitch,
"Give me the credit card."

Lt's a mantra.
Dr. Bob: Maybe another peek

at the website will help
with the calls, hmm?

Get you more familiar
with what we do here.

Okay.
Call me.

Give me the credit card.

Let's go a little deeper.
Deeper?

You'll still touch.
A little deeper.

Lt's getting deep.

A little more.

Lt's pretty deep.
Okay, try it now.


Ugh.

That's good, but--
Jack, that's good, but go under.

Make the bubbles under the water,

then come up.
Take a breath, then go under.

Bubbles, come up.
Get a rhythm going.

We'll do it together.
Are you ready?

But it's good. Are you ready?

Breath.
(Both inhale deeply)

Under.

You can keep your eyes open.

My goggles leak.

They should suck around
your eyes a little bit.

How do they feel?
Okay.

L want you to visualize.

Visualize?
Lt's a technique.

Close your eyes.
L thought you said open them?

When you do it, yeah.
But now

it's something you can do at home--
visualization--

when you're not actually in the water.
L want you to close your eyes.

Okay.
See yourself going under,

blowing bubbles, coming up.

Okay.
Try it. See yourself do it.

Okay.

(Breathing slows)

Man: Jack.

Jack.
Yeah?

You visualized?
Yeah.

Your eyes were open?
You said close them.

No, to visualize.

Yeah, when we do it, yeah.

But when you visualized you went under,
your eyes were open?

(Both laugh)

Yeah, l think.

Try it again.

Yeah, open.

Good. Okay.

Look at me when we do it.

We'll do it now, together.
Are you ready?

Yeah.
(Both inhale deeply)

You're doing good.

L can do better.

You're doing good.
L can do better.

(Both laugh)

This fucking guy.

L just need the application.
We're closed.

Just the application.

Fuck you.

Lucy: lt's a sales job.
That's the bottom line.

Lf you don't close, you don't last.
L was on the phone with Jack.

L was talking to you.
L was listening.

What did l say?
You have to fire Connie.

When do you go in?
Tonight. Why?

So what's up with Jack?

He was upset
about a guy at the MTA office.

Wouldn't give him an application
because he was a minute late.

He needs to hook up. Lt's time.

Shit. L'm running late.

Jack's got me,
you and the limo job-- that's it.

That's it for me. L've got you...

(door closes)
...Jack's a friend and l drive a limo.

You take business classes at City.
He's talking about the MTA.

Look, l love Jack, but Jack's--
l don't know what it is to call it.

What would you say?
L don't know what it is

you don't know what to call.
Lt's something.

Maybe it's nothing.
Connie might be good for him.

Lt'd be easier to help it along
if she were working there,

but l don't know.

L'll call.

(Jazz music playing)

(Lucy coughing)

Connie:
lf he's there, we can conference.

No, l'll hold.

Lucy:
You're early.

L want to talk to you
when you're done.

Dr. Bob wanted to be here.
(Connie coughs)

Jesus! Fuck. What happened to you?
L was attacked.

No.
Yeah, on the subway, a man.

L'm fine. L'm all right.
Give me the phone.

L'm gonna close Curtis-Lopez!
Get off the phone!

Please! L'm gonna close!
Get off!

Mr. Curtis? Hi, Mr. Lopez.

Let's start by getting
your credit card reservation.

L need an ambulance.
AmEx, sure. The number?

A woman was attacked.
She's coughing up blood.

(Coughs)
Blood. Coughing.

3-- yes-- 9-6-9--
She was attacked on the subway.

--Okay-- 1-1-1.
And the expiration date, please.

Hurry.
4/12.

Ls she all right?
Thanks for coming.

Lucky l caught some time.
The roads are no picnic.

Hi, Mr. Kendal.
Thanks for calling back.

No, l'll wait. Sure, l'll wait.

Are you okay?
You sounded pretty worried.

L thought it was internal bleeding,

but it was blood from her nose
that bled backward.

Backward? That's weird.
Yeah, backward into your stomach,

like a lot-- a ruptured dorsal
or something.

She has a couple of fractured ribs.
(Cell phone vibrates)

Are you there?

Third floor?
(Car alarm beeps)

What do you have?
A koala bear.

Authentic koala bear.
But she's okay?

Lt's terrible, huh?
She's okay though?

They said she'll be fine.
He got her a koala.

Think she'll like it?
Sure, it's cute.

(Cell phone rings)
l'll go see if l can learn anything.

Classic Limousine Service.

The hospital.
So how's the gal?

She's okay.

Dorsal something broke.

So what did you get her?
You got her something, right?

Uh, l got her a koala bear.

A stuffed bear.

Koala.
They live in Australia.

Okay. Yeah, roger that.

(Clears throat)

Just-- you know.
Yeah.

Lucy: We can say hello now.
Okay.

(Cell phone rings)
Hang on.

Dr. Bob, you got my message.

No, before l could tell her.

L've gotta take this. 10 minutes.
(Cell phone vibrates)

She closed Lopez.
Clyde: Classic Limousine Service.

Okay. No, l can. L'm on my way.

Plaza client wants
to take his kid to Serendipity

for the hot-chocolate sundae.
L hear they're good there.

Yeah. Where's Lucy?

She said to go in.
We can go in?

She's on the phone with her boss.
L gotta go.

Down the hall, room 302.

L brought a friend.

(Connie chuckles)

Oh, this is so sweet.
Koala bear from Australia.

Connie: Oh.

Shouldn't you be working?

Uh, air-- airport's closed--

you know,
blizzard conditions, so--

You've got to be careful driving.

Yeah.

L look forward
to when winter's over.

Lt's not summer for a while.

We could do something
before summer,

you know, when you feel better.

Okay.

Maybe--
l don't know-- dinner.

You know, when you feel up to it.

You know, a big feast.

Just-- just have too much
of everything.

No one has ever
done that for me before.

L hope you're a good eater.
No one has ever cooked for me before.

Cooked?
No one has before.

Well...

cooking.

That'd be nice.
Yeah, no one's ever cooked for you?

My mom, yeah.

Your ma. L only have
a basement at my uncle's.

Kind of a--

a hotplate.

Oh. Oh no, it's-- it's okay.

No no.

You know,
Clyde and Lucy have a kitchen,

so l'm gonna cook for you.

A dinner party?

No.

Yeah.

Small.

So do you feel okay?

L think l'm on drugs.
Yeah, probably.

(Clears throat)

Someone was

pressing up against me.

L could feel he was--

you know?

He was rubbing against me.

Oh shit.

No, that's--
lt wasn't out.

L shouldn't have told you.

You'll think of it
when you look at me.

No. Lt's not your fault.

(Clears throat)

Do you--

do you think you might wanna--

listen to this song?

Lt's a positive vibe.


There.

Some of the words are
hard to get at first so...

you have to listen a few times.

(Reggae music playing)

Clyde:
You wanna cook for Connie?

Yeah.
This is something you want to do?

Yeah.

The problem is
you don't know how to cook.

Yeah.
(Both laugh)

l don't know how to cook.
Lucy doesn't cook.

Plenty of people don't know.
Yeah, and l don't know.

Thanks.
So what's the solution?

L need another beer.
Mmm.

The solution is to have the Cannoli
teach you how to cook a meal.

Who?
Someone Lucy knows.

He's the head pastry cook
at the Waldorf-Astoria--

desserts,
but he can cook food too.

He can write out a recipe
and teach you how to cook it.

He'll do it?
He'll do it for Lucy.

What do you think
you want to make?

lt's French-- French Bordeaux.

L saw Clyde.
Yeah, he's out working up an appetite.

Yeah, he wants
to out-eat everyone, l think.

He's okay, right?
Yeah. He's...

Yeah, he smiled
and said "Hot to trot."

Yeah, he went for a walk.

(Clears throat)
"Hot to trot"?

Um, like a compliment, you know?

But he seemed--

l don't know--
a little upset first, maybe.

Yeah, he went to get out, l think,

you know,
get in a more positive vibe.

Yeah yeah yeah.
He gave me a hug even.

A regular hug, right?
L mean you're not saying--

Oh yeah, regular.

He's had a little wine l think so--

Connie: Oh.

Yeah, he just said,
"Nice cha-chas,"

gave me a hug
and said he'd see me in a minute.

Yeah.

Yeah, he's okay.

Wine coming up.
(Connie whispers) Okay.

(Wine sloshing)

Here.
Okay.

(Both chuckle)
(folk music playing)

Â¶ See what l have. Â¶

Yeah. Wow.

A hookah.
Connie: l've never tried a hookah.

First time for everything,
right, Jack?

A special night for special people.

Connie's having wine.
Would you like a glass?

Not yet.

You look really pretty.
Doesn't she, Jack?

Sexy.

Yeah.

Wow.

Â¶ You will lift his body
from the shore... Â¶

ls it time to take a check on things?

Â¶ Oliver James washed in the rain Â¶

Â¶ No longer... Â¶

Black hashish.

Â¶ Oliver James washed
in the rain... Â¶

l used to get high
with a bagpipe player from Scotland.

He could really take a puff.

Â¶ On the kitchen table Â¶

Â¶ That your grandfather did make Â¶

Â¶ You and your delicate way Â¶

Â¶ Will slowly clean his fate Â¶

Â¶ Oliver James washed
in the rain... Â¶

The au gratin is turning

the required amber hue--

the critical juncture.
(Door opens)

Clyde: Hey hey!
(Door closes)

Yo yo.

Whoa! Look at my foxy lady.
Jack: Everything's almost ready so--

(folk music playing)
Some after-dinner brandy

that l had to sample to make sure
it was worthy of your fine cuisine.

Okay. Great. Yeah.

Uh, just mellow.

(Both laugh)

You're my best friend.

Yeah.
L love you.

L want to say something.
Jack: Uh, maybe later. Lemme just--

For you and for Connie.
Let me say something.

Look at this. This is beautiful.

Let's smoke a toast

from this beautiful hookah

that my foxy lady got special
for this special night.

To you.

Come on. A toast.

To Jack and to Connie.

Yeah.

(All laugh)
(Lucy silent)

(music continuing)

Â¶ Where is my love? Â¶

Beautiful.

Beautiful together.

Both of you.


Let's smoke a toast to all of us.

(All laugh)
(Lucy silent)


Â¶ ln my arms finally... Â¶

Connie: Ooh.

Ooh! (Laughs)

Oh.
Connie: Wow.

(Clyde laughs)
(laughs) Oh.

(Connie coughing)

Â¶ Where is my love? Â¶

Clyde: Oh, man.

Â¶ Horses Â¶

Â¶ Galloping... Â¶
(distorted laughter)

Clyde: Whoa.

Â¶ Bringing him Â¶

Â¶ To me... Â¶
Yeah, this is--

Â¶ Where is my love? Â¶
(Jack and Connie laugh)

Clyde: So... (snickering)
(Connie laughing)

Â¶ Where is... Â¶

Cool...
Â¶ My love? Â¶

...that Lucy would get this.

Lt's so perfect.
Â¶ Horses Â¶

Â¶ Running free Â¶

Â¶ Carrying Â¶

Â¶ You and me... Â¶
(all laughing)

Â¶ Where is my love? Â¶
(Sings)

(smoke alarm beeping)

Â¶ Where is my love? Â¶

What's that?

What?
Something's burning.

Burning?
What?

Oh oh oh!

Oh! Oh no!

Shit! Fuck!

Oh, God damn!
Clyde!

Hurry!
Jack: Fuck!

(Pans clattering)
Calm fucking down.

Well, fuck it. What about this?
Yeah, what about this?

Just fucking stop!
Stop it. Whoa.

Stop it!
(Whispering) Ah!

Oh fuck!

Jack.

Jack:
Not now!

Fucking--
(beeping continues)

Clyde: Fucking--
(alarm clatters)

Shut the fuck up!
(Beeping stops)

Fucking bitch!
L'd like to talk to you.

l just need a minute!

Connie: Jack.
Just a minute!

(Footsteps)
Clyde: Jack.

This always happens.
What?

Jack: Whenever there's
anything good, it fucks up!

Lt fucked up, but, you know,

it fucked up because we forgot.
No, you fucked it up,

because you made a fucking toast!

Clyde:
Because l love you.

We all love you.

You forgot the food
because you were being loved.

That's the important thing
to remember.

We can get by this.
Everything's ruined.

That's fucked up,
but we can get by this.


(tape player clicks)

(reggae music playing)

Ah.

Clyde:
"Positive vibes."

Who said that?

Â¶ The rivers of Babylon! Â¶

Tape: Â¶ By the rivers of Babylon Â¶
Â¶ We sat down there! Â¶

No, it's "Where he sat down."

Tape: Â¶ Where he sat down Â¶
Â¶ Where we sat down Â¶

Â¶ And there we wept Â¶

Â¶ When we remembered Zion Â¶

Â¶ But the wicked carried us away Â¶

Â¶ ln captivity Â¶

Â¶ Required from us a song Â¶

Â¶ How can we sing
King Alpha song Â¶

Â¶ ln a strange land? Â¶

Â¶ Sing it out loud... Â¶
Yeah yeah.

(Lucy vocalizing)
Â¶ Sing a song of love, sister Â¶

Â¶ Sing a song of love, sister... Â¶

Clyde: Forget it, man!
(Connie and Lucy vocalizing)

Come on, Jack!

Â¶ So let the words of our heart Â¶

Â¶ And the meditation
of our heart Â¶

Â¶ Be acceptable in Thy sight Â¶

Â¶ Over l... Â¶
Fuck it!

Tape:
Â¶ Me got a feeling, shorty... Â¶

Clyde:
All right. The man.

Man of men. My man Jack!
(Music stops)

No one ever cooked for you.

You cooked for me.

You're gonna cook,
row in a boat-- everything.

Everything. Right, Connie?

She's okay.

Yeah yeah yeah,

Clyde:
Yeah, pink flake he said. Pure.

Wow. This is mine too, right? Pink?

Forget it. They'll go away.

Fucking paranoid moment.

(Knocking on door)

No.
Fucking let me go. L want to see.

Okay.

Oh!

Sorry.

Federic! Federic!

Federic.
We'll talk later.

Put the lights on.

Put the fucking lights back on!
(Music stops)

(clears throat)

Lucy:
You wanted to totally fuck up

Clyde: l was gonna be okay with it.
...to totally embarrassed me.

Asshole.
No, because l've grown.

L wanted to show l've grown.
You are so fucked up!

Okay. Okay, forget it.

L'm sorry.
You're right. L fucked up.

Forget it, okay? Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

Lucy:
This didn't happen, okay?

Just forget it. Asshole.
Clyde: l wanted to be normal.

L just wanted to be normal
with the Cannoli.

You'll look for some other life
with some other person,

like the death guy.
Don't embarrass yourself.

You think l'm nothing.
You're fucking nothing!

That's what you want?!
You're fucking nothing!

L fucking try, okay?

L fucking try!
You love l fucked someone,

Lt makes you feel so moral.

Your bullshit night school.

You'll be driving a limo
when you're 100.

You love l fucked someone else,

so you can feel superior.
You're a baby!

Clyde: l never lied to you.
N-- he, uh--

What, Jack? What is it you want
to say about your asshole friend?

L told you what l did

and you couldn't stop wanting
to fuck me all night.

L never lied to you.
And l never told you everything.

You're right.
You're fucking nothing!

You'll always be nothing! Nothing!

Â¶ And turn the white snow Â¶

Â¶ Red as strawberries
