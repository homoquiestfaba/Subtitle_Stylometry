[water flowing]

What are you doing?
[gasps]

[breathing heavily]

Violet Markey?

Oh, my God.

Please go.

Well, I don't think that's very...
Just go!


I asked you first.


This is higher than I thought.

Hey.

Hey, look.

Look what I can do.

Stop. Stop!

Hey, Violet.

[breathing shakily]

["The Mountaintop"
by PaintSmooke playing]

[indistinct chattering]

Hey. Do you have plans this weekend?
My parents are gonna be out of town.

I was thinking about having a party
or something.

Violet?

You OK?


"Everything" is a really big word.

Let's start with...
[boy] Do you mean physically?

Emotionally?
Those both could encompass "everything."

Or is "everything" encompassed
by both things?

Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything?

If "everything" is encompassed
by both things,

are they a part of our reality,
or are they somewhere else?

This isn't funny, Theodore.

Finch.

I need you
to take these meetings seriously.

I get it.

OK, do you "get"
that you're on probation,

and in danger of not graduating?

You've already missed
two weeks of school this year.

Yeah, um...

my grandma...
Stop one second.

I just wanna clarify real quickly.

Is this the grandma who's died four times
over the past three years?

Five times, actually.

This is the fifth.

She's our miracle.

I really wanna help you,
but you've gotta take this seriously.

I mean, you agreed to these terms,
these weekly counseling sessions,

maintaining a B-average,
extracurricular participation.

And I am loving pottery.

Come on, man.

Look, I get it.

If I screw anything up, I'm out.

We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch.

You just need to show up.

because I missed early admissions,

but it's not like that matters, anyway.

I mean, I know I'm gonna get in.

Did you apply anywhere yet?

Hey.
Hi.

So, you going to Amanda's party?


So I've heard.

It couldn't hurt
to have a little fun, right?

Yo, do you think it'd be weird
if I named my kid after a famous person?

Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue,

do you...
do you think he'd be mad about it?

Is "DeVito" the middle name?

Yeah.

Follow-up question:
how high are you right now?


On the scale,
I'd probably say very... this way.

[Finch] On the scale...
[boy] Yeah?

What are you looking at?

Just admiring the social norms
of teenage angst.

Are you looking at Violet Markey?
Yep.

Her, um...

her sister died, right?

Yeah, dude.

Hm.

Why ask about her all of a sudden?

I'm intrigued.
A guy can't be intrigued?

Well, a guy can be intrigued.
You being intrigued is weird.

[boy] Definitely weird.
No, I don't think it's weird.

I wouldn't say "weird."

Wait, if you don't think you're weird,
well...

Yeah, that's true. Very true.
[boy] She has a point.

[tires screech]

[woman] Your guidance counselor called.
Embryo?


[Finch chuckles]

His name's Embry. I call him Embryo.
It's the little things, Kate.

Did you do something
I should be worried about?

I'm genuinely offended
by that supposition.

Finch.
No.

It's fine. I'll deal with it.

[Kate] I hate when you say that.
Why?

Because what you really mean is
that I'm gonna have to deal with it.

Did you cut class again?

No! For fuck's sake,

just go hang out with Tina
or whatever it is you do.

I'm fine.

OK. I'm gonna be home late.
There's food in the fridge.

Mm-hmm.
Real food, Finch.

Where's Mom?

She had to go to Chicago for business.
Remember?

Oh, yeah, right. Cool.
Love you.


Love you.
Love you.


I'm gonna get the dessert.

that today couldn't have been easy.

And it wasn't easy for us either.

I feel an obligation to make sure
you see the wondrous sights of Indiana

while you can.

To wander them, if you will.

For your class project, you must report
on two or more wonders of Indiana.

You will write about them,

explain their significance
to you and to Indiana,

and why you chose to visit them.

I want you to take time
on this assignment.

Be thoughtful.

[students laughing]


What just happened?

That was so weird.

What?
[teacher] All right, settle.

Violet, are you OK?

All right, let's take our seats.
Let's focus up.

If you're done, Mr. Finch?

Yes, I am done, and can I just say you
are doing a fine job teaching this class.

My young brain is plump with knowledge.

[teacher] Thank you, Mr. Finch.
You're welcome.


you'll be taking photos,
doing some drawings, capturing detail.

You will be doing this in teams of two.

Can we choose our partners?

Yes, Mr. Finch.

Hey.

So, um...

do you think that there's such a thing
as a perfect day?

I'm the last person you should be asking.

[microwave pings]


this teacher wants us to do this project
with a partner,

and I just don't wanna do it.

Well, did you ask
for an alternate project?

Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen.

Well, maybe it's time
to get back out there.

That's the same thing he said.

I know it's hard.

But you just don't go out anymore.
That's not true.

When's the last time you hung out
with your friends?

I think it would be really good
if you'd spend some time with them.

So, if I hung out with my friends,
you'd get me outta this assignment?

Yeah.

I Googled you.

You <i>Googled </i>me?

Yeah, what's with that...

with your sister?

Had.

I read some of your stuff.
It's really good.

I don't write anymore.

So, you moved here from California.

How was that?

California to Indiana?

Must've been different.

Yeah.

I didn't know that it happened there.

At the bridge.

I'm not, you know...

Suicidal?

You can say it.

Well, I'm not.

Whatever you are, I saved your life.

No, you didn't.

You're making a big deal out of nothing.

Mm... kinda looked like somethin'.

What do you want from me?

I was just thinkin' that
we should be partners.

For the wandering project.

I think it would be good for you
to get out.

Maybe I don't wanna get out.

Maybe I'm sick of people.

Yeah, people are stupid.

But the tiniest few
might actually mean well.

Why do you wanna do this with me, anyway?

Because there are places
that need to be seen.

Maybe even the smallest of places

can mean something.

At the very least,

maybe they can mean something to us.

Not an "us."

Maybe they can mean something
to you and me.

Jesus, they call <i>me </i>anti-social.

Two wanders. That's all.

We can do more if you end up loving it.

I won't.



Oh, I found another quote for you.

"I feel a thousand capacities
spring up in me."

<i>The Waves. </i>It's from <i>The Waves.</i>

You've got at least
a thousand capacities in you.

Even if you don't think so.

You can keep that one.

You know people call you
"The Freak," right?

Yeah.

Sometimes I say and do things
without thinking, and...

people don't like that,
people like labels.

They like putting you in a box.

They want you to be
who they want you to be.

People don't like messy.

Or different.

My parents are calling Hudson
to get me outta the project,

so you need to find another partner.

OK.

Good night, Violet Markey.

Good night...

["Waking Up" by Mr Little Jeans playing]

Hey, where you going?

Home.

How'd it go with Hudson?

Not great.

Yeah.

you have to figure out another way

I'd be pissed.

Hm.

This is the lamest thing
I think I've ever seen.

[both laugh loudly]

It's OK, you know?
You're not going to hell for laughing.


It was my sister's birthday.

She would've been 19.

That's why I was at the bridge.

Why were you there?

I like to run.

It's pretty early to run.

Yeah.

Let's jump.

All right, on three.

She only liked this Italian poet,

she always said that.

You're not mad that
I'm doing that project with Roamer, right?

No.

OK, cool.
'Cause it's, like, it's not a thing.

No, it's fine. I'm doing it with Finch.

With Finch?

Yeah.

You know that he's, like, kinda dangerous?

No, he's not.

He freaked out last year
and threw a chair at Roamer,

like, in the middle of class.

He did?

but he's seriously fucked up.

the Shoe Tree or the abandoned drive-in,

depending on whatever you're feeling.

you're gonna have to get back
into the world all by yourself.

I was only gonna do two, so...

I prefer Private Violet to...

Public Violet.

Can you put her on?

I'll wait.

give her some space.

is an act. I know it's real.

Of course it is.

How are things?

Just your average teenage melodrama.

Come on. You gotta give me more than that.

People are always telling me what I am.

A freak.

I get it.

Doesn't mean
it doesn't piss me off sometimes.

[Mr. Embry] Well, that must be hard.

Come on, man.

Come on. Help me out here.
Come on. Help me out.

Maybe if...

you got a fainting couch,

you could put it right over there.

It would really give me the <i>mise en scÃ¨ne</i>

It's called Fresh Approach...
Ooh!

...and it is confidential,

so you can say whatever you want

Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch.

Little early, don't you think, Theodore?
Yes. Yes, it is early.

That is a fair observation.

But you see, I'm your daughter's partner
for the school project,

and we really need to get to this place.

Basically, I need her to get into the car.

That car.

That is extremely safe, insured,

gotten so much as a speeding ticket.

it's Violet's decision to make, but...

maybe not a bad idea.

You think she's coming back?

Hey, your guess is as good as ours.

No, wait. No.

OK. If I were keys, where would I hide?

we are nearing D-Day, people.

I'm going to be asking each group
to do a presentation to the whole class.

But today, we're talking about
the five themes of geography:

location, place...

[bird chirping]

No, but honestly,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

This is just what Finch does.
[girl] Yeah.

I've texted him for the past couple days,
and he hasn't responded.

I mean, this is... [girl sighs]

...I mean, sometimes he's gone for a day,
like, maybe two, but he always turns up.

that he was gone for like a week.

Oh, my God.
He came back and said he went camping,

and he had all these poison ivy spots
on him...

Covered in spots.
...itching, it was like... yeah.

It was bad. It was so bad.

I think it's pretty fucked up.

It's easy to pick up your phone
and respond.

It's... that's just something
you have to deal with

if you wanna be close with him, you know?

It just makes me mad.

Yeah. So, we've been to a lot
of really interesting places so far.

[Violet's dad] Do you have an actual plan,

or you've just kind of been shooting
from the hip?

Honestly? I'm just trying to distract her
into spending as much time with me

as she can. [chuckles]

[Violet's dad]
And has it been going OK, or...

Yeah, I think so. I've been really...

[Violet's mom] Look who stopped by.

Hey.

Did you lose your phone?
I've been texting. I've been calling.

Look, let me just show
you this really fast. Hold on.

You could've taken a second to respond...
I know.

...so I knew you were OK.
I had to take care of a couple things.



In the '50s,
a group of boys went swimming here,

and they disappeared.

No one ever found their bodies.



maybe.

Or maybe they found the other side.

They say there's a force in the middle
that sucks you into an underground river

and leads you to another world.

You're not going in?

Oh, of course I am.

It'll be freezing.

It'll be fine.

You should come in.

No, I'm good.
What are you afraid of?

It's cold.
Serious question:

what are you most afraid of?

Dying.

I don't believe that.

Being ordinary.


[Finch continues removing clothes]

[Violet chuckles lightly]

Uh...


I don't know. I guess losing my sister.

My mom's gone a lot.

My dad left a while ago.

New town, new family.

So, Kate's basically all I have.

How'd you get that?

I'm going in search of the bottom.

Finch!

Finch!

What?



Hey, Violet. Violet, I'm sorry!

Violet, I'm sorry.

Violet!


[Violet pants]

I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry.

I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.

Well, you did.

That was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

Where do you go when you disappear?

[Violet pants]

Tell me something real about you.

Or I'm leaving.

OK.

Sometimes I have to go to places
that make me feel like myself.

I need to do things that remind me
that I'm in control.

My dad used to...

get in these dark moods.

Did he do that to you?

I used to be a lot smaller.

I used to not know
how to get out of the way.

<i>â™ª What's going on
Inside that pretty head? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I met you standin' on a ledge â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why don't you come talk to me instead? â™ª</i>

[Violet giggles] And then it goes...
There's the bridge.


Yeah. No, you got it.
OK.

[both singing]<i> â™ª I met you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I met you</i> â™ª

[thunder rumbling]
[Finch chuckles]

[gentle instrumental music playing]


Finch, wake up. We gotta go.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My phone died.

Violet, inside.

Finch, just... you should go home.
[Finch] Don't blame her.

If I could explain. Please...
It's not his fault!

Just get in the house.

We'll talk about it later.
I lost track of time.

Finch!
If I could...

I'm so... I'm so sorry.

It was my fault. I fucked up.

Please, just don't blame her. Please.
I'm sorry.

Just... go home.

[message alert pings]

[message alert pings]

[Finch sighs]

[breathing heavily]


what horrible situations we had you in,
in our heads?

You have to understand how that felt,

your dad and I not knowing where you were.

I said I was sorry.

But you didn't have to treat Finch
like that.

Well, he's the boy
that kept our daughter out all night.

I kept him out all night, too, Mom.

["November" by Babeheaven playing]

[music continues]

Hey.

Hey, V. Hey, what's up?

How are you?

Fine.
It's been a minute. What's been going on?

I can't deal with you right now.

Is everything OK?

Honestly, I don't know.

I'm not tryin' to be an asshole,

but you should know
what you're getting into.

I do.
No, you don't.

He...
Let's go.

Where've you been?
You know why she's hangin' out with you?

She's tryin' to fix you.

Shut up, Roamer! Just...

who he really is, do you? He's a freak!

Call me a freak one more time.
You're a fuckin' freak.

[students gasping, exclaiming]


Finch!


Finch!

Finch! Yo, let him go, man. Get off him.

Finch, stop! Stop!

[Roamer gasping for breath]

[girl 1] Oh, my God!

[girl 2] What the hell?
He almost killed him.

[students muttering]


Fuck!

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Anything?

Guess he's gone again.

I've been friends with the guy
since minute one,

and I haven't waited
for his call in years.

He just...

gets in this mood sometimes, and...

it's hard, you know?

He's not easy,

and everybody who gets close to him
gets burned out.

So, why do you stick around?

[he sighs]

Because...

'cause I love him.

He thinks everybody leaves him
and I won't do that.

This is what we do.

I'm gonna get mad,
he's gonna come back and apologize,

and it'll be like it never even happened.

Hey.

Is... is Finch here?

Did something happen?



Um... I'm OCD and just got diagnosed
with a social anxiety disorder,

so being here with everyone
is not intimidating at all.

[scattered chuckling]

Last year, I started cutting myself.

I still deal with it, but I'm here.

I'm so sorry.

No worries. Have a seat.


Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

Yeah. [chuckles]

Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

Yeah, my week's been OK.

I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

and that's been helping a lot, so...

Good.

Hi. Welcome.

Um...

I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

No labels.

Not really sure why I'm here.
[chuckles lightly]

Uh...

I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

like,

I was there, but I wasn't there.

I was watchin' myself, and...

uh...

I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

I run... a lot.

Sometimes that helps.

Kind of.

I don't know. Is that enough?

Sure.

Thanks. Glad you're here.

Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

I'm Amanda.

I'm bulimic.

I've tried to kill myself twice.

I think about it almost every day.

[footsteps approaching]


No.
[Kate sighs] OK.

I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

Why does he keep doing this?

I don't know.

Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

Yeah.

[Kate] Bye.
Bye.

[footsteps receding]

<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

People are always gonna talk.

It's their specialty.

Are you OK?

I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

Does this work?

It's better than the alternative.

[knocking on door]

about you.</i>

She's been at the house all afternoon.

What's going on?

I don't... really remember...

Dad that well.

And everything I do...

remember is... is bad.

Are there any...

good memories you have of him?

[Kate sighs]

Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

kind of negated all the good times.

But why was he like that?

Was he like that because of us? Was he...

like that because of Mom?

He was like that
because he was a shitty person.


Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

Something or...

someone could make him better, right?

I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

Why are you asking me about Dad?

What's going on, Finch?

Come on. You can talk to me, man.

Nothing, Kate.

Sorry. Nothing.

I'm good.

Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

but I can find someone to cover me.
I'm good. [chuckles]

You know I love you, right, Theo?

I know.

[door opens]

[footsteps approaching]

You scared me.

What is all of this?



On staying awake.

I don't understand what that means.

Sometimes I...

go blank.

I... get into these dark moods.

I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

and then it's like...

all my thoughts are gone at once.

And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

focus and slow down, but...

I can't right now. I can't.

OK.


Maybe there's too much clutter.

I can fix it. I just...

I just need time to figure this out.

[Violet] I'm trying to help you.
I don't need your help!

This is on me! This isn't about you!

You need to tell me what's wrong.

You don't get it.


You're right.

I don't get it.

Don't you know, Violet?

I'm "The Freak."

I'm fucked up!

I need you to leave.

Go!

[footsteps receding]

[door opens]

[door closes]

[birds chirping]

[indistinct chattering]

[brakes squeak]

[ringing tone]

<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

[Violet sobbing]
[voicemail beeps]

Hey, Finch. Um... [sobs]

I'm sorry.

I'm just sorry that I pushed.

And... I...

just need you to come back.

I just really need you to come back, OK?

[breathing heavily]

Hey, kiddo.

Hey.

Dad?

Yeah?

On Eleanor's birthday...

I...

I wasn't really thinking.

I found myself at the bridge.

I was standing on a ledge.

That's how I met Finch.

He found me there.

He saved me.

You... you weren't gonna...

I'm OK.

I was...

confused.

I was sad.

I'm OK.

I'm better now.

Wow.

Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

Me too.


Well...

you two have been a lot of places.

Is there any place else he might go?

Finch!

Finch!

Finch.

[panicked breathing]

[Violet sobbing]

Marco!

[somber instrumental music playing]

[strained sobbing]


I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

who will be incredibly missed
because he has been so dearly loved.

The events of these past few days...

[mournful instrumental music playing]

[indistinct reading]

I'm gonna say bye.

OK, we'll wait for you.


I should've been there.

I miss him.

Just so fucked.


Sorry that I wasn't there for you.

It's OK.

I didn't know how to tell you.

I would miss you.

Yeah, I know you would. [chuckles]

created as a sanctuary

for the weary travelers
to stop and rest along their way.

It was built in memoriam to those

who have lost their lives
in auto accidents...

and as a place for healing.

We remember those who are no longer here,

who were taken from us too soon,

and who we will always keep
in our hearts."

[chuckles lightly]

[sad chuckle]

about everything.</i>

<i>Things that seemed meaningful...</i>

were actually meaningless.

I worried about life.

I worried about what would happen
if I let myself feel again.

I thought I didn't deserve to.

Then...

without really knowing...

I changed.

I wasn't worried
about what would happen if I lived.

I was worried about
what would happen if I didn't.

What I would miss.

I worried about not remembering.

Not remembering all of the moments...

all of the places... [chuckles]

...and that's because of Finch.

Because he taught me to wander.

[breathes shakily]

that you don't have to climb a mountain</i>

<i>to stand on top of the world.</i>

<i>That even the ugliest of places
can be beautiful,</i>

<i>as long as you take the time to look.</i>

<i>That it's OK to get lost...</i>

<i>as long as you find your way back.</i>

<i>But in learning all of that,</i>

<i>I missed seeing
something more important...</i>

<i>seeing Finch.</i>

<i>I missed that he was in pain.</i>

<i>I missed that he was teaching me
all along</i>

<i>how to move on.</i>

<i>Finch was a dreamer.</i>

<i>He dreamt while he was awake.</i>

<i>He dreamt of all the beauty in the world,
and he made it come to life.</i>

Finch taught me that there's beauty
in the most unexpected of places.

And that there are bright places,

even in dark times.

And that if there isn't...

you can be that bright place...

with infinite capacities.
