<i>Hello, Sidney.</i>

Uh, hi, who is this?

<i>You tell me.</i>

Well, I-I have no idea.

<i>Scary night, isn't it?</i>

<i>With the murders and all,</i>

<i>it's like right out of a
horror movie or something.</i>

Randy, you gave yourself away.

Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

<i>Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?</i>

I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

<i>What's your favourite
scary movie?</i>

Oh, come on. You know
I don't watch that shit.

<i>Why not? Too scared?</i>

No, no. It's just, what's
the point? They're all the same.

Some stupid killer stalking some
big-breasted girl who can't act...

...who's always
running up the stairs...

...when she should be going out
the front door. It's insulting.

<i>Are you alone in the house?</i>

Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

<i>Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.</i>

So, who are you?

<i>The question isn't
"Who am I?"</i>

<i>The question is
"Where am I?"</i>

S- S-So, where are you?

<i>Your front porch.</i>

Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

<i>That's the original part.</i>

Oh, yeah?

Well, I call your bluff.

So, where are you?

<i>Right here.</i>

Can you see me right now?

<i>Uh-huh.</i>

Uh-huh. Okay.

What am I doin'? Huh?

Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum
to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

<i>If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!</i>

<i>Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.</i>

Fuck you, you cretin!

No!
