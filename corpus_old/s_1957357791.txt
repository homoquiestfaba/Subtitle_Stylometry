[female radio host]
<i>It's 75 degrees in sunny San Diego</i>,

<i>and the number one song of the day
is still "Blush" by Koop.</i>

[upbeat pop song playing]

<i>â™ª I feel your eyes on me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You should know better... â™ª</i>

Whoo!

<i>â™ª You put on the pressure â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Something tells me I,
I should not let go... â™ª</i>

Whoo! It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

<i>â™ª I've been working hard... â™ª</i>

Whoo! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!

Yeah! Whoo!

<i>â™ª Girl, you make me blush... â™ª</i>


It's an impromptu dance party
with my best friend since first grade!

Because it's your birthday!
[both screaming]


Go, go. Work, work. Drop it low. Oh.

[both exclaim, laugh]

I love this song, but I'm very hungry.

Okay, I need your help.

Question. What do you think?
Quarter-life chic? Or quarter-life crisis?

Huh. Well, right now,
you're matching the lamp, so...

Would a hat help?
[chuckles] No.

Rude!

Here.
Thank you.

Okay, for my Cassie-palooza kickoff night,
we are gonna start off at the club

where I've spent all afternoon
decorating the VIP area.

Hey, I have this crazy idea.
[mouth full] I'm listening.

Instead of going out for your birthday,
what if we just stay home,

and we put on our stretchy pants,
and we puzzle like we used to,

and we order more noodles?

No, no. We're not staying in.
It's my birthday week.

I have to ring in 25 with style!

You've rung in the past four years
with style. One night in won't kill you.

Besides, we haven't puzzled in weeks.
I mean, look at Mona.

She is missing her smile,
and it's kind of depressing.

I'm not bailing on my kickoff party.
It is tradition. My friends expect this.

Well, your best friend
has a huge week ahead of her.

I was just added
as one of the junior research assistants

on a team studying marsupial fossil teeth.

I don't fully understand what that means,
but congratulations! [squeals]

I'm one of three assistants,
so it's really not a big...

No, no! It is a big deal.
You should celebrate.

Because guess what?
Tonight is... [singsong]...a celebration!

Okay. I'm gonna go change. Again.

So should you.
Tonight'll be fun, I promise.

We leave in an hour-ish.

Love you, my bestie since we were six!

Okay.

Whoo! Did I tell you how cute you look
by the way?

Uh, yeah, I think you did,
like, 19 times. Got it.

Good. I meant it every single time.
You look adorable.

I love this dress on you.
Thank you. So, who's coming tonight?

Okay. So Kayla's coming.Â Maddie's coming.

Moving in?

Oh, hi.

Of course you're moving in.
I don't know why I just said that.

Hi, we're your neighbors.

I'm Cassie, and my quiet
but highly intelligent roommate is...

Lisa. Lisa.

Um, I'm around dinosaur bones all day,

so I'm not really
used to talking to people that much.

Right.
Works in the Museum of Natural History.

Oh wow! Yeah,
I compose music for video games all day,

so not a lot of human interaction
for me either.

Oh.

Sorry, I'm Max, by the way.

Ordinarily, I'd shake your hand,
but I'd almost certainly drop this,

um, and I desperately need these dishes.

Oh! Here. Let me open the door for you.
Brilliant. Cool.

Cool.

Okay, we've gotta go,
but, um, welcome to the neighborhood, Max.

Yeah, thanks. See ya.
Yeah. Yeah.

[car horn honking]

Oh, don't give me that look.
What look? I wasn't giving a look.

You wanna play matchmaker?
I didn't say that.

Since you mentioned it,
I did notice a spark.

There was a spark?
Mm!

No, there was no spark.

I'm... I'm really focused on work right now,
and I can't have any distractions.

Not even in the form of our new neighbor
and his cute accent?

I'm not like you.

Okay.
No, no!

I just mean you can juggle a social life.
That's not me.

Yeah, well, I'm a party planner.
It's built into the job.

Well, I'm on a path here.

Nail this junior research position,
get promoted to field researcher,

and then work alongside
my paleontologist hero.

Hey, I wanna introduce you
to my friend Fun.

I don't know if you two have ever met.

[both laugh]

all of this stuff first, okay?


Ugh.

Downward Dad is out of control.
He posts a different pose every day.

[chuckles] I liked his flying crow.
Okay, do not encourage him.

What? Wait. It's not just me. Do you see
how many people like his yoga studio?

Oh, I know. I've heard from everyone
how amazing his classes are.

We should take one.

No, I'm good.

I got enough secondhand yoga from him
growing up that I am centered for life.

I think it's sweet
that he's on social media.

It's like he's trying to connect with you.

Yeah, I love him,
but he's my dad, not my buddy.

I'm fine with our lives being separate.

Okay. Well, if you just left one comment,
it would probably make his day.

Fine. I'll throw him a like,
but no comment.

You happy?
Mm-hmm.

[dance music playing muffled]

our 19th Cassie-palooza kickoff.


Hey, Bob.

Good evening, Cassie.

Thank you.
Ladies, welcome.

She's my favorite person.
I love her so much.


Wow. This is actually really pretty.
Hi!


[woman] Happy birthday, Cassie!
[Cassie] Whoo!

[man 2] Happy birthday!
It's so good to see you.

It's not my birthday, Jeremy.
Not my birthday.

You are the best!


Cheers!


[cheering, clapping]

["Blush" by Koop playing]
[gasps] It's our song.

It's Koop!
Yeah.

We have to dance!
[Lisa] Okay.

Come on! Come on!

[Cassie screams]

<i>â™ª Something tells me I,
I should not let go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Something tells me I don't know</i>...<i> â™ª</i>

Whoo!

Go, girl! Go, girl! Go, go!
Break it down.Â Break it down.

Go, Lisa!Â Go, Lisa!


[all whooping]

<i>â™ª It's almost too much sometimes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The way your body just goes with mine... â™ª</i>

[all cheering, whooping]

<i>â™ª Girl, it makes me blush sometimes â™ª</i>

Yeah!

[woman 2] Yes, Cassie!

<i>â™ª Something tells me I,
I should not let go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Something tells me I don't know</i>...<i> â™ª</i>

I'm flying!

<i>â™ª Just what you do to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Girl, you make me blush, all right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's almost too much sometimes... â™ª</i>

Careful! You're gonna get hurt.

[crowd chanting] Drink!Â Drink!
Here! It's your birthday!

Should I do it? Should I do it? Okay.

[all cheering]
[screaming]

Yeah! Whoo!

[crowd chanting] More! More!Â More!Â More!
Oh yeah!

[all cheering]

[Cassie] So much fun! You!
[woman] You kept drinking shots.

Because you kept handing them to me!

You're crazy! You're...
I can't keep up with you.

Okay, you guys,
next stop is Roddy's house.

I rented a waterslide
that goes from the roof into his pool!

[all cheering]
[man] Let's go!

What's wrong?

Ugh.

You're bailing, aren't you?

I bet you no one would notice
if we snuck back home right now.

I would notice!

You know
that these people are terrible, right?

They're just trying to have a good time,
which is exactly what you should be doing!

Come on.
I like having a good time too.

Only I wanna do it

with people who'd actually care
if something happened to me,

or who would like me even if I didn't rent
a very dangerous waterslide.

Don't tell me you're jealous.

I am not jealous
of people who look filtered 24/7.

[under breath] I don't know!
Kinda sounds like you're jealous to me!

[woman] Come on, Cassie, let's go!
[laughing] Okay, one second!

You know,
you're different when you're with them.


It's like you think you aren't
worth anything if you aren't seen.

Well, at least I'm out making friends,
and I'm not hiding at my desk.

Because I think
that there is more to life than partying

or knowing
all the names of bartenders in town.

Here we go! My life isn't as important
because it's social.

Just because
I'm not one of your science friends

doesn't mean I don't work hard.

I didn't say that!
But you meant it!

I see how you only pretend
to be interested

when I tell you about some event I planned

or your offhanded comments
about how I'm never home.

Like you don't pretend
to understand my life?


Tell me what I do.

You work at the museum.

But what do I do there?

I don't know.
I don't understand that stuff.

And I don't understand your stuff.

[scoffs, chuckles wryly] Classic.

We never hang out anymore.

Just the two of us.

We're busy. We'll just have to get better
at making time for each other.

I don't know, Cassie. I don't think
being friends should feel like work.

I don't think it does, Lisa.

[emotional music playing]

But I can tell from your face that you do.

It's fine.

I don't wanna stay best friends
out of habit anyway.

I'm a habit?

Th... That's it?

You're just gonnaÂ say something like that
and walk away?

Maybe it's time we both admit
that we've outgrown each other.

[Cassie] Who's ready to go to Roddy's?
[friends cheering]

[Cassie laughs] Let's do it.
Sorry about that, guys.

[door lock clicks]




[breathes deeply]


Aw.

Mona's missing her smile.

Hmm.

Here's one.

Put this here.


That'll fix it.

Oh no.

No, no, no, no.

No. No, no, no.

So stupid.



[knocking at door]

[knocking continues]

[sighs deeply]

Ow! [grunts]



[exhales sharply]

[exhales sharply]

[pensive music playing]

[music fades]

[gasps, sniffs]

Ugh.



[pensive music continues]



Ow! [winces, sighs]

[exhales sharply]



[toilet playing "Ring Around the Rosy"]

[song ends]


[distorted chatter]

[ethereal music playing]

[inhales sharply]


Ugh.

[ethereal music continues]

[chattering on video]

Uh, hi.

[video rewinding]

[clears throat]

Excuse me?

[brooding music playing]
[thud]

Did that go viral?

Oh, you're awake!

Welcome. Welcome.

No, no, don't worry.
No, it's research. It's not gone viral.

I'm Val.

I'll be your handler
through this transition.

Well, it's nice to finally meet you,
Miss Cassandra Adeline Garcia.

Now, according to my notes,
you go by Cassie. You're 25...

In a few days.
Huh?

Parents, Howie and Sofia, divorced.

Born May 31st, died May 25th.

Died?

Oh, I'm sorry. Died May 26th.


Who... who are you?

I'm Val. Otherwise known
as your temporary guardian angel.


You don't look like a guardian angel.
Shouldn't you have a halo?

Oh, special occasions only.
Okay, what about wings?

Oh, no, we phased those out years ago.

Okay.
This... this can't really be happening.

I was... I was just with my friends.

Oh! I know!

I... I had...
I had champagne with gold flakes in it,

and sometimes it makes you hallucinate.


Oh, this... this part's always hard.

How can I put this?

Yeah, um, you died.

Stop saying that!
I mean, you saw it yourself, so...

I died in the bathroom?
Yeah.

Oh! Oh, this keeps getting worse!


And the good news is that
the worst is over now that you're d...

No longer living.

You don't have to deal
with all of those human annoyances,

you know, like heartbreak or PMS.

Just think of the afterlife
as one long spa day.

And if you're one of the lucky ones,
it could last for an eternity.

So, I went up?

[inhales] Well...
Is this down? I went down?

You're in the middle.

We call this the In-Between.

So like general admission?

Sure. This is your personal waiting room.

It's your safe space.

It's designed specifically to your taste

to make your transition
more... [inhales]...comfortable.

So everyone who dies is in the In-Between?

Oh no. No, no, no.
Maybe I should give you a pamphlet.

No, no!
I don't need a pamphlet. Just tell me.

It can't be crazier
than anything that's happening.

Well, the In-Between
is for those who have unfinished business

back on Earth,

like yourself.

What unfinished business?

Well, you get a second chance
to make things right

with a select list of people,

you know, and if you succeed,
you get sent to the Above.

And if you don't, well, you know, it's...

it's just, it's... Yeah, it's, you know...

It's... Yeah.
It...

Yeah.

But I thought it was for murderers
and people who don't like BeyoncÃ©.

I'm a proud member of theÂ Beyhive.
[chuckles] Yeah.

No, no, it's a tiered system. Yeah.

You want the Above. Trust me.

You ready to meet your list?

Now? No. I'm not ready! Oh!

[Cassie screaming]

[Cassie grunts, pants]

Oh!

That was like riding a roller coaster
backwards and blindfolded.


Wait, we're at my dad's house.


[gasps, exhales sharply]

[TV plays indistinctly]
[exhales sharply]

Hey, Dad!

Hey.

Hey!


He can't see or hear you.

No one can.

What? No, that can't be right.

Well, we can't risk
scaring people on Earth.

They're so fragile.


It's me! It's Cassie,
your favorite and only child.

[melancholy music playing]

He never let me eat junk food.

What is goin' on?

And why is this house such a mess?

This... this is not like him.

He's Downward Dad.
He's all about healthy living,

and he even makes his own kombucha.

[Val sighs]

How long have I been gone?

Val, how long?

A year.
A year?

It feels like a day.

Well, time works differently up there.

Maybe I should've taken a pamphlet.


was when my mom left.

After you passed,

he gave up.

When was the last time you saw him?

I... I don't know. I...

I kept meaning to visit,
but there were all these events.

I liked one of his posts. Does that count?

Mmm.

Yeah.

Is that why he's on my list?

He's in mourning.

He needs a reason to feel hopeful again.

Tell me what I should do.

You should see the rest of your list.

[whooshing]
[grunts]

[exhales sharply]

Lisa? Really, Val? No. Pass. Hard pass.

There is no hard pass.

There isn't even a regular pass.

What about if I kill it with my dad?
Not kill kill. You know what I mean.

Can we pretend Lisa isn't on the list?

Why are you so afraid
of seeing your best friend again?

My former BFF, and I'm not.
Mm.

There's too much history between us.

Besides, I don't know if I want to.
Some friendships just end, you know?

Shouldn't I have a say
in who's on my list?

This is my afterlife we're talking about.

[inhales sharply] She's been hiding
in her work ever since you left.

Last one out. It's the same every day.

How about we skip Lisa
and move to the next name?

I'll take it. No complaints. Pinky swear.
No. I don't do that.

But I will show you
who's next on your list.

Please be Koop.
Please be Koop. Please be Koop.

[whooshing]
[Cassie gasps]

How are you doing that?

Oh, you can do it too.
It's all part of your basic angel package.

You just focus on where you want to go,
give a little snap or a nod.

One angel I know likes to wink.


Just make it your own.
And then you're there.

So, I can go anywhere?

Oh, no, not anywhere.

Your teleporting is limited
to places that you're needed only.

No detours.

Got it.
Right.

Now, back to the list.

Ugh. I don't know if I'm ready for more.
[woman] Morgan, slow down!

Wait for Mommy!
[Morgan giggles]

[woman speaks Spanish]

[in English] Hi, you're so fast.

That's...
[Val] Your mother.

I haven't called her that
since the day she moved out.

She's Sofia to me.
[Sofia speaks indistinctly]

[Morgan giggling]


I've never met her.

[Morgan laughing]
[Sofia kisses]

So, you do have
some unfinished business, then.

[Sofia laughs]

[Sofia speaks indistinctly, laughs]

Can we go now, please?


[emotional music playing]


Not easy ones.


I believe in you.
That makes one of us.

You have the five Earth days leading up
to your birthday to complete this list.

Wait, five days?

Oh. [laughs]

Sure. Why not? Hey, you know what?
Why don't we make it two days?

Or better yet,
we can just cram it all into one!

Well, just think of it as Cassie-palooza,
the afterlife edition.


It's... it's like Cassie...

No. No, you're right. Yeah.

Okay, right.

Right, so a name will disappear

each time
it's deemed that you have closure.

How am I supposed to do this
if I can't communicate?

Well, you'll find a way.

Can I text? Tweet? TikTok?

No, no, and definitely negatory.

Do I at least get cool superpowers,
like mind control or something?

It's guardian-angel level only.

This is about you learning
to really connect

with the people closest to you.

Yeah, and what if I can't?

Well, I'll be here if you need me.

Except between noon and 4:00. [chuckles]


Look, I'm always going to be here for you.

Now,
is there anything else before go time?

Well,

actually, I, um...

I was wondering...

Yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking.

And, uh, yes,

you do get a wardrobe change.


Yeah, yeah. You just close your eyes
and envision what you want to wear.

But just so you know, you only get
one wardrobe change a day,

so make it count.

[rock music playing]
[exhales sharply]


[yelps, gasps]

It's so sparkly.
[rock music fades]

I think this might be
my favorite part about being here.

[Val clears throat]

Oh.

I guess it really is time.





[ethereal music playing]

Somebody call Marie Kondo
because joy is <i>not </i>sparking here.


Lisa first.

Great.

Guess I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.

Okay.

What would Val do?

[inhales, exhales sharply]


[music swells]


I did it.
[whimsical music playing]


[snoring continues]

What the gamer geek?

[snoring continues]

Who are you,
and what did you do to my room?

[door opens in distance]

[sighs, inhales sharply]


Hey.

[sniffles]
Oh.

Oh, the cute neighbor still lives here.
Are you two in love yet?

Hey, you.
Hey. Morning.

Are you just getting home now?
Yeah.

I'm, uh, in the process
of scoring this game

about, uh, post-apocalyptic,
motorcycle-riding zombie Vikings.

Whoa.
Yeah.

It sounds lame now I'm saying it out loud,
but it's pretty dope

if post-apocalyptic, motorcycle-riding
zombie Vikings are your thing.


You're heading to work early.
Oh, no watch.

Yeah, yeah, I, um...

I like getting to work
before everybody else, you know?

The calm is... is, um...

Calming.

Exactly.
Yeah.

You get it.
Yeah, I do.

[Max chuckles]
Yeah.

Cool, well, hopefully one day,
when our schedules can align,

um, we can properly hang out? Me and you?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Yeah, okay. Okay. Yes, yes.
Yeah.

Yeah, I would... I would like that.
Brilliant.

Okay, well, um, I'm gonna go.
Yeah.

Cool. Well, have a good day.
Thank you. You too.

Good seeing you. Bye.
Bye.

It's been a year,
and you still haven't gone out with him?

It is a good thing I'm back.

So the way we ended things...
Talk about bad timing!

Are you still mad at me?

I know I should still be mad at you,
but it doesn't feel right anymore.

When did this place open?
[Lisa laughs]

Ugh! I hate being so out of touch!

Morning, Emme. How are you?

Hi. I've got your order waiting.

Oh my... Emme, you spoil me.

Who is Emme? I know all your friends,
and I don't know her.

[Lisa] Okay.
Ta-da!

Oh. Ooh. What is that smell?

I'm working on a new brownie recipe.
They're just out of the oven. Wanna try?

I will always be your guinea pig.

[Emme laughs]

So, um, how has everything been?
Are you feeling a little bit more settled?


Haven't seen much of the town yet.
I should probably get out more.

Baked goods
aren't the best conversationalists.

Well, neither are bones.

[Emme, Lisa chuckle]

I am thinking of throwing
a one-year anniversary party for the shop.

That would be so cool.

Careful. It's hot.

Oh!
[Lisa] Okay.

I miss brownies. Why couldn't
I have had death by chocolate?

Wow. Wow.
I mean, this is... this is incredible.

Oh, it's made with love. And agave.

I need to go to work, but thank you.
I'll see you later, okay?

Ciao for now.
Bye!

Bye.

[uplifting music playing]

So, how's your list coming along?

The quiet type, huh?

[echoing growling]

[pensive music playing]

[Cassie sighs]

So...

this is your life now.



Okay.



You beat me to work. Again.
[gasps, exhales]

Oh, jumpy.

Are you on something?

Next time,
bring enough for the whole class! [laughs]


Yeah.

What do you want, Raj?
[Raj] Did you hear?

Uh, hear what?

Dr. Redding's leading a dig
at Hell's Creek this summer,

and she's looking
for a junior field researcher to join.

Wait, Dr. Marion Redding?
Are you messing with me?

Not only that, the GOAT herself
is coming into the office

to hold interviews.
I'm about to go sign up over at the...

break room.

[whimsical music playing]


How retro. But I dig it.

What are you waiting for?
Just write your name.

L-I...

[Raj] Pretty competitive, huh?
[groans]

And she's only picking one person.

I think we all know who that'll be.

R-A-J.

B-R-I-T-T-O.

Ooh.


Don't listen. He's trying to psych you out
in the lamest way possible.

I'm gonna sign up later.

I have a lot of work to do,

so I can't really think
about this kind of thing rightÂ now.

Sure.

You're giving up?

In the bag, Britto.

What's so important?

I left a farmer in his barn-themed
waiting room for you. Are you okay?

It... it's Lisa. She's so stubborn.

You know,
I don't think this is gonna work.

She doesn't seem to miss me.
There's no trace of me anywhere.

Oh, and get this. I've been replaced
by this roommate who is full-on dark web.

Why aren't you saying anything?
You're saying enough for the both of us.

Look, I know going back is hard,

but you aren't forgotten.

Oh, I don't know about that.

Well, maybe if we cut out
all the "I"s and "me"s and look harder,

you'll find
that she actually does need you.

Whoa!


[exhales sharply]



Why are you sleeping?

There is a whole world out there,
and you are missing it.

Lisa. Lisa, wake up.

I need to talk to you.

Lisa, wake up!

Wake up!Â Wake up!Â Wake up!

Wake up!Â Wake up!


Come on, Val. This isn't fair.

How am I supposed to do this
if my best friend can't see or hear me?

I need a little help here, please!



[humming "Blush"]


[humming "Blush"]

Trying to sleep.

[humming loudly]

Why won't you let me sleep?
[humming continues]

[tinkling]
[humming continues]

[both screaming]

[both gasping, screaming]

What's happening?
[splutters] I don't know.

Oh, but it worked!

You can't be... you can't be here. No.

Oh, you can see me?

This is a dream. Maybe a nightmare.

Work... work... work has been stressful.

You can hear me too?

This isn't supposed to be happening.

This is awesome,
and crazy, but mostly awesome.

You aren't here. Nope. You died.

Yeah, that sucked.

[breathing heavily]

I don't believe in whatever you are.

I'm nothing scary!
I'm like a junior guardian angel.

Well, not officially.
I don't know if that's a thing,

but that's how I make sense of it.
Titles aren't important right now.

Oh.

I'll be back.

Not... not in an ominous way! In a good way.

It's really nice
to be able to talk to you again.

[Lisa hyperventilating]


[breathes heavily]

[exhales sharply]

Sorry for interrupting, but you'll never
believe what happened. Lisa...

Can see and hear you. Yep. Yep.
Everyone knows. You're trending.

I've heard rumors of this,
but I've never experienced it.

Making contact used to be fairly common,

but now, with all the distractions,
it's practically non-existent.

Well, it happened.

You never forget the first time
your friend looks at you in sheer terror.

[reverential music playing]

[angels whispering]

Everyone's staring at me
like I'm a unicorn.

This is the Angels' Den.

It's the central command
of the In-Between.

Unicorns are in a different area.



A book? Really?

Yes. Don't you just love books?

Okay.

Mm. Here.

Yep, yep, yep. There we are.

Okay. It's quite rare.

"Said In-Betweener can only affect
the physical world

once visible to subject."

"It mainly happens in cases

where the people involved
were extraordinarily connected."

"Some call it soul mates
or kindred spirits."


So,

it might be a fluke in the system,

or it's just you and Lisa.

We should test it.
Okay.

[snaps]
[whooshing]

[indistinct chattering]
[jazz music playing]

Go on, then. Start talking to someone.
Let's see what happens.

Okay. Hey! What's up?

Go on.

Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

[men speaking indistinctly]

Hello?

Hey, ladies!
Ooh! I like your shoes. [chuckles]

[women speaking indistinctly]
No? Nothing?

Okay. No one's responding.

I'm usually the center of the party,
not on the sidelines. This feels odd.

You seem strangely cheerful for someone
trying to solve a fluke in the system.

There's just so much energy.

Isn't it beautiful?

You know the saying
"angel on your shoulder"?

That's who I want to be.

A guardian angel who's there
through all of these stages of life.

Not just at the end.

So why don't you?

It's not my decision to make.


[barking]
Oh.

[barking continues]

Is this dog barking at me?


Yeah. Animals are more open
to the spiritual world.

Some kids are too.

No, poppet, we're working.
Go back to your owner.



So we can talk to animals?

Not we. I can.
Yeah, it's above your power grade.

Oh.
Sorry.

Right, so nothing from strangers.

Nope.
That's good, actually. Less cleanup.

We should try someone close to you.


[emotional music playing]

Not much to report
since I talked to you last.

Is he trying to talk to me?

I stopped seeing
that woman I told you about, Maria.

She's nice. I'm just not ready yet.

He's been doing this since you left.
Brings him comfort.

This whole room does.

The yoga studio's doing fine.

I'm still more focused on running it
than teaching.

There's been requests for me to teach
my sunrise class again. I probably should.

I just feel so guilty going on like normal
when you can't.

I miss you, kiddo.

[emotional music continues]

All I ever wanted was to protect you,
and I couldn't even do that.

Oh, Dad, but you did.

Remember that song I used to sing to you
when you were little?

I don't remember.

Try. Maybe I will.

[humming "God Only Knows"
by The Beach Boys]




That was a long time ago.

I'm sorry for not visiting much.

For making fun of your Downward Dad posts.

I'm gonna let you know I'm okay.

Somehow.

We can try your mum.

I'm not ready for her yet.

[exhales sharply]

I'm going back to Lisa. I wanna fix this.

It'll be day two, so make it count.

I'm clearly just having a stroke.

Wait, Lisa, wait!

You felt that too?
[whispering] This isn't happening.

Let me explain, okay? Or at least try.

Uh, there's this list. And for me
to get to the big party in the sky...


A door? Really?


Let's analyze some fossils. Whoo!

I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.


Okay. If you don't wanna talk right now,
then we don't have to. Fine.

But I'm not going anywhere until we do.

[Cassie humming]


Because I'm working hard,
it could cause the visions.

Okay. I'm sick! So sick. I'm sick.

Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.
Maybe not, but it's happening.

Don't be shy. Come and try.

Why wait till it's too late?

Uh-oh. You look like you could do with
a caramel mocha pretzel bite.


Or two.

Let's get you inside.

This place has so much potential,
but what is with all the doilies?

Would you like a calming tea or...


I need an exorcist.



this is the one-year anniversary
of my best friend's death.

I think it's making me a little crazy.
Your flatmate, the one you told me about?

You told her about me?
Yeah, Cassie.

This is gonna sound really weird, but, um,

she talks to me, and... [breathes heavily]

...I can see her.

That doesn't sound weird at all.
She was your best mate. She's part of you.

Thank you for letting me lay this on you.
[Emme laughs]

I just...Â I really, really needed
to talk to someone.

Is she here now?

Boo!
Uh-huh.

Yeah. Yeah. She, uh...
[Emme] Oh.

...she thinks your store needs a makeover.

Oh! Well, I'm open to anything
that will encourage people to hang out.

See? She agrees with me.
I'm starting to like this Emme.

in their own way.

It's a compliment when they come back.
This doesn't feel like a compliment.

Would your friend like an eclair?
Don't... don't encourage her, please.

Thank you for understanding, Emme.
Thank you. I just...

I think that I need to go and be by myself
for a while. I'm just gonna do that.

Who turns down a free eclair?
I can't eat, and I'd still take it.

just give me a little bit of space?

Okay.


[keys jingling]

[whimsical music playing]

[sighs]
How was your walk?

Okay, that's it. I'm Googling therapists.

I didn't mean to scare you. Okay?

to make sense of everything.

Look, is this happening
because of that fight we had?

If I had known that was the last time
we would see each other, I...

I would have done things differently too.

Is that why you're here?
Be... because of what I said?

According to...

Do you mean God?
Val.

A woman? I knew it.

Val's my handler.
She's like my temp guardian angel.

In order for me to move up,
fingers crossed,

I'm supposed to help you,
my dad, and my mom for some reason.

Well, I don't need help.

Look, I didn't make the list.

I wanna show you something.

I found it under your bed.

Your dad took the rest of your stuff.

Um... [smacks lips]
You wouldn't recognize your room.

Oh, I saw.
Huh.

Something told me I should keep it.

I thought you'd forgotten about me.
What?

We've been in each other's lives
for as long as I can remember.

How... how could you think that?

Being dead
brings up a lot of insecurities.

[both chuckle]

[Cassie sighs]



Postcards from all the amazing places
she visited after she left us.

[emotional music playing]

Hey, uh,

would you... [chuckles]

...maybe wanna puzzle?

You still have it.

might be missing.

I found it on the floor that morning.

Can't leave Mona without her smile
this time.

Look, I don't know what's happening,
and I probably need to schedule an MRI,

but it is really, really nice
to have you back.

It's really nice to be back.

[front door opens]

Hi, Piper.

Are you okay?

No.

[bedroom door opens, closes]

What do you think she does in there?
Money laundering, hacking.

Basic roommate stuff.


This almost feels like old times.
Almost.

You know what'd make it better?
Your boyfriend Koop's music?

I can't help who I love!

You forget
that I introduced you to his greatness.

He's my soul mate.
Do you know he has a new song?

More like a whole album.
Are you serious? I've missed so much.

Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Google, play "Drive" by Koop.

<i>â™ª I wanna drive... â™ª</i>

Whoo!
[laughing]

<i>â™ª Say you love me, if you don't... â™ª</i>

Impromptu dance party!
Impromptu dance party!

[both laugh]

I knew you'd love it!


Hey, hey.

I'm gonna bring it low again.
I'm gonna bring it low again.

She's goin'. She's goin'.
She's goin', goin', goin'.

Whoo!

I like this!
[Lisa laughing]


You got good moves.

<i>â™ª I wanna drive... â™ª</i>

There you are.
I don't need food anymore.

Yeah.

Sorry.
That's okay.

I can't imagine
a world without cold noodles.

I think I had more dinners at your house
than at my own.

Especially during my dad's
cooking learning curve. Remember that?

You know my parents love you.
I love them.

Look, I know that you thought
your dad was overprotective.

Smothering.

But he did the best he could, Cassie.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm starting to realize that.
["Drive" ends]

[video game music playing]
[Cassie] Is that next door?

Doesn't that get annoying?

I don't find it annoying.

No, no, no! He's just super talented
and cute and smart.

Oh, you still have a crush!

What'll you do about this year-long crush?

Absolutely nothing.

We're fine the way we are. I...

I don't wanna mess things up.
What's to mess up?

If you don't go after what you want,
how will you get it?

Like that job interview.

You know you want it,
but you didn't even sign up.

How do you know about that?
I am everywhere. Duh.

For someone who studies bones,
you need to get some in your back.

How long have you waited to say that?
When did you declare your major again?

[both laugh]

Since you were digging dirt
in your backyard,

you knew what you wanted,
and I have always admired that.

Really? 'Cause you used to tease me
pretty hard about being so work-focused.

Okay. Well, that was alive me,
and she was so very wrong.

[sighs]
[video game music continues loudly]

That's it.

This is why I'm here.

I'm going to get you together
with Dreamy Max!

I am sureÂ that there are
more substantial reasons why you're here.

No! Shush. Okay, this is my warm-up.

Okay, if we can hear his music,
then he can hear ours.

And since you aren't going to go to him,
it's time for him to come to you.

Hey, Google, replay Koop.


Um, I'm not sure she speaks angel.

A little help, please?

Hey, Google, replay Koop.

["Drive" playing]

Tell her to go louder. We want it to sound
like you're having the best time ever.

Curiosity will hit, and he won't be able
to stay away. It's science.

Hey, Google, highest volume, please.

[volume increases]

<i>â™ª It messed me up... â™ª</i>

Yes.

Whoo!

Okay. What do we do now?
Wait for it.

Three,

two...

<i>â™ª I wanna drive... â™ª</i>

What happened to one?

Huh. He's shyer than I thought.

What are you doing?
Going old school. Knocking on his door.

What? No!
Yeah. I'm doing it!

Cassie! So embarrassing!

Oh.

Hi. Hey. Um, I heard you playing music,
and I was gonna knock,

but then I didn't wanna disturb,
so I didn't yet.

[both laugh]

Are you having a party in here?
Who, me? No.


I'm just rockin' out.

Oh.

Hey, is it too loud?
'Cause I can turn it down.

Hey, hey, Google, turn it off.

No, you didn't have to do that
on my account. It's a great song though.

Oh, I can turn it back on.
No, not if you don't want to.

Sorry. Look, you know how we were saying
that we wanted to hang out?

Well, uh, Koop's actually
shooting a music video tomorrow.

What?
My friend's directing it.

He wanted to know
if I wanted to visit the set.

So, uh, I thought maybe...
He's chickening out. Invite him in.

Stop it.
Stop what?

I didn't say anything.
Did you say something?


Do you wanna come in?
I think I have some wine.

Sure. Yeah. No, I'd... I'd love that.

[Max chuckles]

[exhales sharply]

Okay, okay. Cool shoes.


Mmm. You smell clean. A good start.

Yeah, this is pretty much
exactly like walking into my place.

Except a lot bigger and a lot less stuff.

A little obvious, Max.
My friend is a genius. You can do better.

Shut up. You're a puzzler?

I'm a puzzler.

Yeah. I can lose myself for days
doing one of those.

I just started up again.
No way.

My best friend Cassie and I,
we used to puzzle all the time.

Oh, here.
I found it in the back of the fridge,

so I'm not sure if it's good.

Vintage. Nice.

Only the best for you, neighbor.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Have you ever been arrested?
How is your credit?

[spits]
Oh, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Wow.

It's disgusting. [laughs]

Bottoms up.

Well, now we're in it together, right?

[laughs]
[coughs, laughs]

Aw, he's adorable.

So it must've, um, been hard,
you losing your friend like that.

How long's it been? A year?
This week, yeah.


I'm sorry.
Thanks.

Though sometimes I just feel like
she's actually hovering right over me.

I'm in the way. Hint taken.
I'll be in your room if you need me.

How are those dinosaurs of yours?
They still extinct?

Yeah. That happened.

Um, yeah, I... I mostly work with fossils.

I just find something so comforting
in... in holding history in your hands.

Yeah, I get that.

The tangible
is easier to believe in, right?

Exactly. Yeah, I've always thought that.

On a scale of one to ten...
Mm-hmm.

...how big of aÂ <i>Jurassic Park </i>fan are you?

No, like a 20.
[Cassie] Twenty!

She watched it all the time!

All the time.

I... I, um, I watched it a lot.

And <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

[Max chuckles]

I blame my geekiness
on those movies actually.

I like your geekiness.

Late. It's getting late.

Um... I...

I have to work tomorrow.

Yeah, no. Yeah, of course.

Um, well, look,

thanks for having me. [chuckles]

And for the questionable wine.

[Lisa laughs]
That was great.

And I'll see you soon. Yeah?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cool.
Cool.

Okay.
Okay.

Bye.
Bye.

[door locks]
[sighs]

That was a good-ish start. Now you
have to learn how to stick the landing.

I think I really like him.

Well, then it's good you kicked him out.

Okay. I need to go to bed.

And don't watch me sleep tonight.

It's creepy.

Aye, aye, Captain.

Proud of you!


What was I even thinking?


Why did I kick him out?


I totally blew it.

So stupid.


"Thanks for the wine"? Who says that?
Like she's my waiter for the evening.

For God's sake, why can't I just
ask her out like a normal human being?

I had the chance, and I blew it.

Oh, what was I thinking?


It was like I was leaving a wake.
They really are made for each other.

Oh. "I like your geekiness"?
I mean, who says that?

"Hi. I'm Max, your weird neighbor,
and you'll never speak to me again."

Cool. Nice one, dude.
Brilliant. Brilliant. What a corker.


[Lisa groans]

[Lisa groans]


[whimsical music playing]

[whimsical music continues]

Um...

Hmm.

Oh, so cute. [kisses]


I'm late!

[inhales, groans]

Right.


What? Seriously?
I don't have time for this, Cassie!


[door slams shut]
[footsteps pattering]

[door slams shut]


["Blush" playing loudly]
Codswallop!

<i>â™ª I feel your eyes on me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You should know better... â™ª</i>

<i>- </i>Oh.
Oh.

Hey.
Hey, sorry. I... I didn't see you there.

I'm a bit of a mess right now.
I'm late for work, and I...

It's okay.
I'm on my way, um, to get some coffee.

Cool.
This is a coincidence.

Yeah, that's... that's one word for it.

Listen, I really should have asked this
last night,

but would you wanna go
to that Koop music video thing with me?

I thought it'd be cool
to see what goes on behind...

Yeah. Yes.

Cool. Well, I can pick you up at 4:00,
if that works?

4:00?

I'm not exactly a leave-work-early
kinda gal, but, yeah, why not?

Yeah. Yeah, 4:00 is great.

Don't be late.
[both laugh]

What about your coffee?

Right. Yeah, no. Sorry.

I... I forgot I'm actually in the throes
of a pretty vicious eBay bidding war

over the original VHS
of David Bowie's the<i> Labyrinth</i>,

and I really should get back to that.

No rest for the wicked and all that.
But I will see you later. Yeah?

Okay. Yeah, I'll see you later too.
Bye.

Bye.


Thanks, fairy godmother.

[uplifting music swells]


[indistinct chattering]

[distant giggling]

[Sofia] Am I doing it wrong?
[Morgan] Yes.

[Sofia laughing]

[Sofia] Do I got it now?
[Morgan] Yes.

[Sofia laughs, chatters indistinctly]

[emotional music swells]

[whooshing]
[gasps]

Oh. All right. Time to start
Project Get Dad Out of his Funk.

What to do first?

[whimsical music playing]


[whimsical music continues]

[whimsical music subsides]

Come on, Dad.
You know you're tempted to try this out.

[emotional music playing]

That's it? Not even a downward dog?

Your yoga-avoiding daughter
is trying to connect here.


I can take a hint, universe.

Or Cassie.

[heartwarming music playing]

[breathes deeply]

[indistinct chattering]

Ooh, that looks good.
Oh, she always...

Wear a bell or something.
[scoffs]

Are you trying to shut me out?

I don't want people to think
that I'm talking to myself.

Oh. Look around.

Everybody looks
like they're talking to themselves.

It's talking to each other
we have trouble with.

Oh, that's surprisingly deep.
I have my moments.

It's been one of those days.

Well, luckily, your best friend is here,
even if she is wearing EarPods.

I'm trying to help my dad.

You should see his house. It's a mess.
And he stopped doing yoga.

Wait, seriously?
Yeah.

That is so unlike him.
[sighs]

Although you know what?
He hasn't posted in a while.

Yeah. We can't communicate like you and I,
so I'm trying to get creative.

Yeah.

I, uh, I also saw Sofia.

She was with her daughter.

My half sister, Morgan.

They were playing at the park.

She came to your service.

I wanna be happy for her. I do.

But seeing her so carefree,
you know, it hurts,

and I get angry, and it's just...

It's not a very angelic reaction, huh?

I mean, I wouldn't know, but, uh,

it does sound like a pretty human one.

I don't know how I'll make things right
before my time is up.

[phone chimes]

A little buzz here. Let's see what it is.


Wait! Downward Dad is back!

Whatever you're doing, it's working!
[gasps, laughs]

So...

So?

Are you ready for your big date?
Date? What date?


Are you kidding me? I'm freaking out!
Why do you think I'm stress eating?

Oh, you're so lucky I came back.

I know.

It's okay, right?

This is what you wear when you're sick,
and you go to CVS for more cough medicine.

Okay. Hey, now,

we don't all have your never-ending supply
of brand-new clothes.

Um...

Ah! Ooh!

Love this one.


Okay, don't push it.
Pink lip?

Fine.
[squeals]

Uh, wait!

The pink lip.
The pink lip.

Let's see.

Yeah. Yeah, I like it. I li...
I don't know. Is it... is it me?

You look perfect.
Really?

That cutie composer
won't know what hit him. Come here.

[knocking at door]
He's here!Â He's here!

Ah! Wait, wait, wait!
Okay, come on. Let's go!

Wait! One last thing. Hold on.
[spraying]

Turn.
Stop spraying me! Stop it! He's here.


You look...

Wow. [chuckles]

You look wow yourself.


After you.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thanks.

Mmm. And he has manners.

What are you doing here?

Like I'd miss a chance
to see Koop live and in person.

Don't worry. You won't know I'm here.
Cassie!

[car door opens]

Hey.
Hey.

[Max] You all right?
Great.

["One Look" playing]

Way to angel block, Val.

I know you like him,
but he's not on your list.

Can we add him, please?
He was right there. I couldn't resist.

Please stop glaring.
Your disappointed look is weirding me out.

Need I remind you that
you're still on the clock, young lady?

You have just two days left,
and no one has been marked off your list.

I'm working on it, okay?
This is harder than I thought.

You're on track.

Just stay focused.

Open your heart.

["I Only Have Eyes for You"

Uh, to regret.

To regret.

Cheers.

Mmm.

[all exclaim]

Seriously?
Sorry, are we not...

I'm... Sorry.
Are you okay?

My knee cramped up.

I can't believe the terrible timing
for a pain like that. It's...

I thought this was... Are we not a thing,
or am I just confused?

Max, no, I'm so sorry.

I'm just... I'm a little nervous and edgy,
and I've got a lot going on.

Full confession.

I...

I haveÂ liked you
since the first time we met.

Yeah?

Yeah.
Oh.

Well...

Full confession.
I've liked you since then too.

And I may regret
saying this out loud, but...

I still have this overwhelming desire
to kiss you.

[song fades]
[door opens]


You have that good-date glow.

He wants to go back out again.
[exclaims]


Sorry for crashing.
[sighs]

I was, uh,
non-living vicariously through you.

It's okay. Just... just do me a favor

and maybe don't come
on any of our other dates.

No chaperone.

[clicks tongue] Got it.

[Lisa sighs]

I'm glad it went well.
Oh, it really did.

We spent the entire night just talking.

He's so interesting.

He knows all of these obscure bands.

Plus, um, he even got me this blanket
before I said I was cold.

Oh, and he smells really, really good.

Like pine and pizza.
[laughs]

You're falling for him.
Yeah, I am.

Hey.

Why are you crying?

These aren't sad tears.

Yeah, but they're still tears.
This is your time. It's not about me.

It's just...


I guess it's starting to hit me that
I'm never gonna have a first kiss again,

or go on an amazing date,
or go on a bad date.

But worst of all,

I'm not gonna be here
to watch all your career successes.

I won't be here
to watch you walk down the aisle

and become a mother.

And, oh,
you're gonna be an amazing mom, Lis.

Thanks.

[voice cracking] Your kids
are always gonna know they're loved.

Plus, they're gonna... [sighs deeply]

...dominate the science fair.

Oh, they will, won't they?
[chuckles] Yeah.

Sorry, maybe these are sad tears. [laughs]

This isn't fair.

No one should have to die young.

I have to believe there's a reason for it.

Even if I don't know what it is yet.

This is all my fault.
No!

If I'd just stayed there
with you that night,

then none of thisÂ would've even happened.

No. This was gonna happen
no matter what you did. It was my time.

When... when you were a kid,
and your parents would fight,

I was the one
who would distract you with a puzzle.

Yeah, and you had extra PJs for me
whenever I didn't wanna go home.

You've always been there for me.
But that night, I wasn't.

I mean,
I heard you coming to my door, and I...

I have been mad at myself ever since.

Hey.
[sniffs]

Don't be.

In a weird way,
what happened is a good thing.

Now... now you get to live your own life

and don't have to worry
about taking care of me anymore.

You don't mean that.

I can't lie. I'm almost an angel.



Well,

I'd like to be there for you
one last time.

I don't know
why I'm supposed to care about her.

She left me, you know?

[inhales sharply]

But she's on my list, so... [exhales]

Well, hey, if you don't care,
then why keep her postcards?

How can I help you with your mom?

[Cassie scoffs]

I can't believe she lives here.

This is exactly what she ran away from.

Hi.
Hi. I was so glad you called.

Come in.

Thanks.

[emotional music playing]

I, um, thought
we could catch up on the patio.

I made lemonade.
Would you like some? I have tea.

I have one of thoseÂ Jarritos.
You used to love those.


Um, I think water is fine. Thanks.

[Sofia] How are you, Lisa?
Good.

[Sofia] Still working at the museum?
Yeah.

but it's been really good.

[Sofia] Good.
How are you?


This is Morgan.
Oh, let me see.

Oh, she's so cute!
She's like Cassie in a lot of ways.

Yeah, look,
she's got that same mischievous grin.

They would've liked each other.
I always wanted to introduce them,

but I wanted Cassie and I
to be okay first.

I'd like to get started.

So,

I found these
in Cassie's box of keepsakes.


She kept them?

It was my only way to know you.
Tell her that, please.

Yeah. I think
they made her feel closer to you.

I used to read her <i>Mary Poppins</i>. [laughs]

She always wanted to see London.
Did she ever go?

No, I didn't go anywhere.
I was hoping you would come back to me.

No, she didn't.

Too bad. She would have loved it.

Mmm. Her first crush, actually, was
this guy who moved here from England.

Ian.
[Lisa] Ian.

It's one of the many things we have...
had in common.

I missed so much of her life.

It must have been confusing for her,
dealing with boys and dating.

Yeah, but my mom was there for both of us
to answer some of the tough questions, so...

Ask her why she left.

[breathes deeply]

I'm sure that this is, like,
really hard to talk about, but, um...

Cassie always wanted to know why you left.

There's not one reason.

What did I do to make you leave?

Was it something Cassie did?

No, never.

Cassie, she was an angel.

It was all me.

I...

I was young.

And I thought I knew more
than anyone around me.

Sounds like Cassie.

I, uh, had this romantic idea

of what I thought
being a wife and mother was like.


But in reality,

I wasn't ready
to be responsible for anyone.

Looking back at it,
I see how patient and loving Howie was,

but at the time,

I found that suffocating.

I said the same thing.

For a while, Howie used to send me

pictures and letters,

telling me about her.

I never knew that.

But I was too ashamed to respond,
so he stopped.

I convinced myself that postcards
were an adequate placeholder,

and one day I'd be able to explain it all,
and we'd actually laugh about it.


Sounds so ridiculous
when I say it out loud.

I... I let her down.

The last time I saw her
was college graduation,

and we were like strangers.

I remember.

Now it's too late to make it right.

And I'll never forgive myself for that.

Okay, I've heard enough.
[clears throat] I need to go.

If Cassie was here right now,

what would you say to her?

What are you doing? I didn't ask that.

That I regret not taking her to London.

I should have been there

to help her with her homework,

hold her when she had a nightmare.

I made a lot of selfish decisions.

But one thing that never changed...


One thing that never changed
was my love for her. [clears throat]

If Cassie were here...

I would tell her that the day she was born

was one of the brightest moments
of my life.

And running away,

it was my worst.

I just hope she knows how sorry I am.

She does.

She knows.

Are you okay?


[engine starting]

[emotional music playing]

[door lock clicks]


Hey.

How are we supposed to we finish this
if we don't have all the pieces?

God, this is so frustrating.
Why did you even choose this puzzle?

Uh, you sure
you wanna talk about the puzzle?

Do you know how hard it was

not being able
to say everything I wanted to her?

I really don't.


I have years of questions.

Yet standing next to her, I found
that I just wanted to yell or run away.

Like mother, like daughter.

Yeah, but you didn't,
and that's a really good thing.

Would you have translated if I did?

It upset me
that you took the conversation over.

No, no. I didn't take anything over.

I could tell
that she needed to talk to you,

and you needed to hear
what she had to say.

That was for me to decide!

I'm on your side, Cassie.
Ugh.

I could tell she needed to talk.
You needed to hear what she had to say!

You don't get it!

How could you?

You have a perfect life, a perfect future.
I have none of those.

Okay, okay. You're mad at your mom.
That's totally understandable, but...

You know what? It's... [sighs]

It's not okay
for you to take it out on me.

Sorry. Does my messy non-life
make you uncomfortable?

Here we go again. Classic.

I died before I ever got a chance to live!

Well, I'm hurt too!
Did you think about that, huh?

God, after our fight,

after you left, I had to carry around
the guilt of our fight.

I had to pick up the pieces,
put my life back together without you.

Well, you did a great job.
Look around! There's nothing left of me!

I've been reduced to a box of knickknacks!

[both sob]

After everything that's happened,
I can't believe we're back to arguing.

Yeah.

Well, I'm dead,

so you don't have to worry
about arguing with me ever again.


[melancholy music playing]


You cannot bring that anger in here.

Look, I... I met with my mom.
I got Lisa a boyfriend.

I've been talking to my dad
even though he can't hear me.

Isn't that enough? Do I have to go back?

Well, not if you don't want to.

Thank you.

Well, then, why don't I just walk you
over to the elevator?

When you get there, hit "B" for Below.

Very funny. I get it.
No, you don't.

Why would you risk throwing away
everything you've worked toward?

And over an argument?

You were doing so well.

You think I'm doing well?
Yes, I do. Don't you?

I don't know. Maybe.

I hoped I wouldn't have to tell you this,
but here we are.

If you really want this to end now,
I can make that happen.

But just know,
if you leave the list unfinished,

then all the good you've been doing
will be undone.

Poof.

Everything?

Lisa?

My dad?

Everything.

Oh, that's... that's terrible.


I can't... I can't do that to them.

[exhales sharply]
So, you've made your decision?



Dad, I really need to talk...

What isÂ she doing here?
More tea?

Please.

I still can't believe
you left your accounting practice

to open a yoga studio.

You always joked about it,
but I never thought you'd actually do it.

becoming a drummer in an '80s cover band.

[chuckles] I remember that one.
This was a better lifestyle choice.


You might not have said that
a few days ago.

This past year has been a challenge.


I know this may sound nutty.

During that visit, it...

it was almost as though
Cassie were standing right beside me.

I know what you mean.

She was a lot like you though.

Fearless, independent.

She'd dive headfirst
into... [chuckles]...any situation.

But more than anything,

she was this force of energy
who lit up every room she entered.

After Lisa left, I, um...

I had this overwhelming urge to see you.

I just need you to know
how deeply sorry I am for walking out.

It wasn't how I saw life going,
that's for sure.

Your leaving forced me to become
a better man, a better parent,

even when she didn't want me to,

and I hope that in some way I was able
to minimize whatever scars she had.

Yeah, I know you did.

[clears throat]
Look, I've kept you long enough.

Thanks for this. [chuckles]

You know, I don't know
if it's the palo santo in the air

or this dandelion tea talking,

but I feel as though Cassie,
wherever she is...

Brought us back together.

[emotional music playing]


[emotional music continues]


I forgive you.

[engine starting]


[whooshing]
[sighs]

So proud of you.

That felt good.

I can tell. I mean, you seem lighter.

Hey, so, um...

I need a favor.
It's for a good cause, I swear!

No swearing.

I didn't actually swear!

There's this bakery, and the owner
seems like a really thoughtful person.

I know she's not on my list,Â but I think
I can help her and help my dad.

We're not running
a matchmaking service here.

I know, but they could both use
a kind person in their life.

This could also be a thank-you to Emme

for being such a good friend to Lisa
since I've been gone.

[Val scoffs]

I've never had anyone
want to <i>add </i>to their list before.

I've also never had
anyone like you before.

[clicks tongue] I'll allow it.

[exclaiming] Thank you!
Oh!

You're the best! Thank you! Thank you!

Yeah, but you're
still on the same timeline.

Tomorrow is your last day, Cassie.

I got this. [sighs]


Perfect.

[whimsical music playing]

I can't leave it like this.
It's a bakery, not Grandma's basement.

[uplifting music playing]

[whimsical music playing]

[door closes]

Are you behind this too, Cassie?

I like your faith in me, Dad.


[TV playing indistinctly]

[woman on TV] <i>...and has traveled the world
searching for the perfect dessert...</i>


[in Spanish]
We're leaving in five minutes.

[in English] We don't wanna be late again.

[emotional music playing]

Would you like some tea?

You can see me?

I saw you at the park too.

Aren't you scared?

You're my guardian angel.

Ask your mom to read this to you.

I will.

This is our secret, okay?

[emotional music continues]

[woman whispers] Dr. Redding.

[upbeat music playing]

[exhales sharply]

[pensive music playing]

I wish Cassie was here.


Hey.

Hey.

I do have a piece of you.

It's from our very first puzzle.
Yeah.

It's, uh, it's kinda like my lucky charm.

I thought you were done with me.

There are no grudges in the afterlife.

Are there any here?

No. No, no. I do not wanna lose
any more time with you.

[sobs] Neither do I.
[whispering] No, no, no!

I don't think I can explain an air hug.
Good point.

Yeah.

Okay, so what's the problem?
Why are you hesitating?

This is yours to lose.

Yeah, exactly.

Cassie, what if I don't get it? What then?

You'll survive, and you'll go on
to something even better.

No. No.


Yeah.
Are you the best person for this job?


I'm not buying that yeah.
You gotta try again.

Are you the best person for this?

Yeah! I am the best person for this!

Yes! There's my strong friend!
Life is too short to be fearful.

Yeah, Cassie,
I eat, I sleep, I drink this job.

If I got this job, I'd crush it so hard,
they'd name a freaking fossil after me.

I would...
Use that energy and go sign up!

Right! Sign up first. Dominate second.

Yes.
[exhales sharply, grunts]

Oh, I've created a monster.

I love it.

Phew. Bam, bam. Good luck.


Hi. [chuckles]

I've heard nice things about you, Lisa.

Thanks.
I'm glad you decided to interview.

And last too.

That's a bold move.

Shows the competition
you're not worried about who came before.

Oh, um, I didn't plan that...

Modesty's a myth
that was sold to women a long time ago.

Be proud of your work.

Why paleontology?

I love digging in dirt,

and I hated when people told me
that it wasn't a proper career for a lady.

But, uh, mostly, I found it comforting
studying what is real.

With fossils, it's like this tangible
connection to the past, you know?

But, uh, now I've...

I've started learning from what I...

I can't see.

Bye.
Bye.

Bye.
See you.

Cassie?

I got it! I got it!
[screaming]

I got the job! I got it!
You got it! [squeals]

Thank you so much for the push.
I couldn't have done it without you.

It was all you.
No, I can't even believe I did it.

Um, I can!
This is, like, the best day of my life.

So proud of you!
Thank you.

So, are you gonna come to Emme's tonight?
I'm bringing Max.

I wouldn't miss it.

[both chuckle]

[emotional music playing]

You made it!


Excuse me. Hello.

I think I'm in the right place?

If you're here for the party,
then yes, you are. I'm Emme.

Would you like a homemade fortune cookie?

Don't mind if I do.
[Emme chuckles]

"You don't need to look any further."
[Emme] Oh.

I guess this is the right place.

How did you hear about my little soiree?

Honestly,
my home was filled with your fliers.

No explanation. I have my suspicions,
but no one would believe them.

Well, since we're being honest,

my shop didn't lookÂ like this
when I closed up last night.

I woke up this morning, and voilÃ .

I've got my suspicions too.

Someone's either looking out for us,
or we need to get our locks changed.

[both laugh]

Can I get you a green tea?

I've got sencha, matcha...
Matcha?

Of course.

What did you say your name was again?
Howard.

Some people call me Howie.
Howard.

It means "strong heart."

Well, that went better than expected.

[indistinct chattering]
[Max] Wow.

It is fascinating the many ways
that people can make a living, isn't it?

Look at that.
Come on.

[both chuckle]

Okay.

gluten and dairy-free.

That's a new development.

Come on. I'll introduce you.


Hi, Mr. Garcia.
Lisa!

Hi.
Oh!

What are you doing here?
I could ask you the same.

Welcome to the party.
Hi, Emme! Hi!

She's one of my regulars. And I suspect
is some of the reason I had this makeover.

If only I knew how you got in here.

Well, I'll never tell.

So this is Max. He's, um,

my...


Uh, wait, sorry. Is that cool?
One hundred percent.

And how do you two know each other?

Lisa and my daughter were best friends.

What? Are you Cassie's dad?
Yeah.


[indistinct chattering]

Um, I just have to make a call.
I'll be right back.

All right.
Okay.

Someone has been busy.
Are you still playing Cupid?

Can I help it if their paths crossed?

You still can't talk to him, huh?

No.

It's my last day. But he seems happier,
and that's what's important.

Huh.

What's with the "huh"?

You can go anywhere I can go, right?

I mean, if I'm needed. Why?

After this party,
I need you to find me. No questions asked.

What are you up to?
You're not the only one with surprises.

You have to find me after
and not before, okay?

Okay.
Okay.



I wanna thank you so very much for coming.

We're obviously here
because of our beloved Cassie,

um, who left us a year ago this week,
but, um,

I really don't want this to be about loss

because this is also the week
that she came into our lives.

One thing we know about our Cassie
is that her joyous life was a party.


Especially the week of her birthday,
or as she called it...

Cassie-palooza.
Cassie-palooza.

[smacks lips] So, these wish lanterns
that you're holding

will carry whatever you wanna say to her.

And as they float across the water,

your thoughts will be sent to her.

why don't you go first? Okay?

Hey.

Hey. This entire time, I thought
I was the one helping all of you, but...

all this has me realizing that...

you were the ones helping me.

I'm not... I'm not ready to lose you again.

We got a second chance.
Not everyone can say that.

I want you to know
you're more than just my best friend

and my puzzle partner, okay?

You're my family.


I couldn't imagine going through this life
or any other without you.


<i>â™ª I may not always love you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But as long as there are... â™ª</i>

Wait, that's it.

That's the song
he would always sing to me as a kid.

<i>â™ª You never need to doubt it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll make you so sure about it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause God only knows
What I'd be without you â™ª</i>

He can't hear me.

Hey, we'll do this together, okay?

<i>â™ª If you should ever leave me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Though life would still go on
Believe me â™ª</i>

[Lisa and Cassie]
<i>â™ª The world could show nothing to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So what good would living do me? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause God only knows
What I'd be without you â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª God only knows what I'd be without you â™ª</i>

[exhales sharply]

I'm not afraid to go anymore, Dad.


I love you, pumpkin.

I love you too, Dad.

[emotional music playing]

I gotta go.


Bye.

Bye.




You're cutting it a bitÂ close.

I always like
to be the last one to leave a party.

Wait, please.
I have to find one last thing.

We have to be back before time runs out.
You don't want to tempt fate.

It's important. It's for Lisa.
Cassie!

[Cassie gasps] There it is!

I found it!
The final piece. The list is complete.

[echoing thump]

What's that look?
Your time is up.

[emotional music playing]

[door opens]

[door closes]

Happy birthday, Cassie.

What did they decide?
Well, you missed your deadline.

There's no getting around that.

We also broke the rules
by going off the list.

However,
you did those things in good faith.

The fact you'd risk your afterlife
to help someone not on your list

and take full responsibility
to protect me,

well, I mean, it's just...

it's beyond selfless.

So you're not in trouble?

Even better.

Thanks to your testimony,

I've been promoted.


I know! [laughs]

Yeah.

[both breathe deeply]

I'm afraid to ask, but...

what about me?

It's time to find out.

[emotional music playing]

And for my last job...



The world is a better place
with you watching over it.

I was your favorite, wasn't I?

Cassie,

you know I don't pick favorites.


[chimes]
[both exclaim]

[both laughing]

We did it!
No, you did it.

[breathes deeply, chuckles]

The Above is waiting.

[breathes deeply]


[Muzak version of "One Look" playing]

[elevator doors open]

Going up?

Okay, I have to address
the elephant in the elevator.

Muzak, really?
You're Kooper Keene!


I think it's meant as a compliment
since we're both in here together.

We're here together?

Like, how can this be real?
Is this real? Are you real?


It's nice to meet you, Cassie.

You know my name? [laughs]

How? Why?

Funny story.

I was volunteering
in a disaster relief area

when disaster struck again.

I was able to save a few people,
but I didn't make it.

I am so sorry.

There's worse ways to go.

Yeah, there sure are.

Val was in the angel committee
that sent me straight up.

She said that we were supposed to meet.

This is gonna sound really weird,

um, but I feel like I've always known you.

So do I. [chuckles]

[birds chirping]

[uplifting music playing]


What now?

I don't know.

I've never been dead before.

Shall we do this?



<i>â™ª I know regrets
