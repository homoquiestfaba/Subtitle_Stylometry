Hi, Mom.
Hello, Madeline. What are you doing?

Uh, homework.

Over spring break?

You're not climbing,
are you?

'Cause you know l don't
want you to be climbing.
No, Mom.

l'm not climbing.

Mrs. Phillips,
they've been waiting for you.

l'm sorry.
Just one second.

Sweetie, l'm gonna be late,
so l'm gonna need you to--

Pick up Max from day care.
Surprise.

Yeah. lt's not gonna be
forever, sweetheart.

lt's just until l finish
this project.

All right. l'll be right down.
Down?

Over.
You know what l mean.

Okay. l'll see you a little later.
l love you.

<i>[ Phone Beeps Off]</i>

<i>Good afternoon, Mrs. Phillips.</i>
<i>Nice of you tojoin us.</i>

Are you aware that your security company's
deadline for getting my bank online...

was 23 hours ago?

Uh, Mr. Brisbane...

l did inform you that,
due to the age of the building--

The primary shareholders will be here
for the opening of the bank...

next Friday night.

As l have said, the system will not have been
tested, and l cannot, in good conscience--

That party will take place, Mrs. Phillips,
with or without your consent.

This is one of the most
complex installs--

Hartmann, don't tell me
how to run my bank. All right?

<i>You work for me. Remember?</i>

Now, when l turn around...

both of you will be gone.

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ]</i>
<i>And the race is underway.!</i>

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ]</i>
<i>Lap masters, secure the roadway.</i>

<i>Number 1 6</i>--
<i>[ P.A. Announcer Continues, lndistinct ]</i>

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ]</i>
<i>Number 1 1, Bad Chad, is into the pits...</i>

<i>as we go into</i>
<i>turn number one.</i>

<i>##[ Rapping Continues ]</i>

Hey, retard,
l'm losing the race...

'cause you don't know
what you're doing!

l can't believe Mom made me
hire you as my lead mechanic.

<i>[ Chad ] Damn.!</i>
Done!

<i>[ P.A. Announcer Continues,</i>
<i>lndistinct ]</i>

You'd better pray this works.

[ Engine Starts, Revving ]

<i>[ Boys Shouting ]</i>

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ] Number 1 1, Bad Chad,</i>
<i>is finally out of the pits.</i>

<i>##[ Rapping Continues ]</i>

<i>[ P.A. Announcer Continues,</i>

Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ] Chris the Clutch pulling</i>
<i>tight, giving Bad Chad reason to worry.</i>

[ Engine Sputtering,

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ]</i>
<i>Looks like that front end may have gone out.!</i>

<i>Number 1 1, Bad Chad,</i>
<i>is out of the race.</i>

Good job, dorkus!

Dumb, stupid--

Gus!

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ]</i>
<i>He's got his own problems.</i>

<i>His crews are out there cleaning up.</i>
<i>We got ourselves a yellow flag.</i>

<i>##[ Man Singing ]</i>

<i>##[ Continues ]</i>

<i>There she is.</i>
<i>My leading lady, my star.</i>

Sound, speed and...
action!

Maddy!

<i>Maddy.!</i>

Whoa!

Hey! Fart knocker!

l'm gonna kill you!

Stop it!

Cut it out!
Cut it out! Aah!

Not so tight!
Let go!

Hi.
Oh, come on!

Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?
Ah, climber girl.

Go contaminate someone else.

<i>Oh, look.!</i>
<i>Here come Captain Cool.!</i>

Loser number three.
[ Laughs ]

Look, l'm having a barbecue at my house,
if you guys wanna come over.

Definitely.
Definitely.

<i>Hey, l don't know</i>
<i>if you heard...</i>

but Bad Chad picked up a shift
at your mama's bank.

<i>l'll be working with Lieutenant Ferrell</i>
<i>in security.</i>

One step closer
to being a cop.

Don't worry. Ferrell won't let Bad Chad
carry a weapon. He's an intern!

Trainee, butt munch!

Sorry. He's training to be a butt munch.
Doing a good job, too!

<i>l'm gonna brain you.! Get over here.!</i>
<i>[ Gus ] l'm gonna tell Mom.!</i>

<i>[ Chad ]</i>
<i>You are so dead.!</i>

<i>When l catch you, l'm gonna</i>
<i>give you a purple nurple</i>--
So immature!

lsn't he?

<i>[ P.A. Announcer ] Okay, folks,</i>
<i>race number three will start in five minutes.</i>

<i>So let's get ready to...</i>

step on the gas
and let's kick some... butt!

lt's race time!

[ Cheering ]

""Butt''?

""Butt'' what?

Hi, Dad.
Hey, kiddo. What's up?

Mom needs me to pick up Max
from day care again.

[ Sighs ]
lt won't be forever, sweetie.

All right,
now you sound like Mom.

That's so terrible?

You okay?

ls this a new style
that the kids are sporting?

Dad, don't freak out.
When do l ever freak out, Madeline?

lt's just that there are
a thousand other sports...
<i>[ Shaking Tablet Bottle ]</i>

that don't involve falling
a hundred feet to your death.

Dad, you said standing on top of
Mount Everest was the best day of your life.

No, l said it was
<i>one</i> of the best days of my life.

[ Growls ]
Look.

<i>See, l even wore</i>
<i>the hat you gave me.</i>

l just don't understand what the problem is
with me trying to be like you.

[ Sighs ]
Do we have to discuss this every day?

Just till l turn 1 8.

[ Grunts ]

Okay, race fans,
here we are.

The last race of the day!

<i>Drivers,</i>
<i>get in position.</i>

[ Sizzling ]
Hey, Mr. P, can l ask you
a very serious question?

Only if you want
a very serious answer.

Do ladies like guys who build stuff
with their hands?

Or do they go for the nerds who
play computer games and stuff?

Yo, what he means is...

<i>do women prefer</i>
<i>a low-l.Q. Ã¼ber-male...</i>

<i>who only knows stuff</i>
<i>about spark plugs...</i>

or do they prefer
a true artist...

<i>who has both sensitivity</i>
<i>and a brain?</i>

<i>That's a very difficult</i>
<i>question, boys...</i>

but l'm afraid
l'm not the one to ask.

Hey, Madeline Rose--
[ Both ] No, no, no, no, no!

Dad, don't call me that.

What are you doing?

Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

[ Sizzle ]
Ow, ow, ow! Ow!

Aah! Aah!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

lt's an old
climber's trick.

[ Groaning ]

Dude, you're gonna have a scar.
Why do you get all the cool stuff?

<i>lt's true. Women love scars.</i>
<i>This drives Maddy's mom crazy. Check it out.</i>

Whoa!
That's gross!

You can touch it if you want.
-<i>ls that from when you fell?</i>

Yep. Hundred-foot free-fall.

Okay, okay. Okay.
Stop touching.

Bad touch. Okay.

<i>##[ Radio:Pop, Faint ]</i>

Hey, stranger.

Not you too.

Now, <i>this... is a nutritious dinner.</i>
Please.

Don't give me
a hard time.

We just miss you.

Especially Maddy.

And l don't wanna have to set my alarm
for the middle of the night...

just so l can have
a date with my wife.

<i>##[ Radio: Continues ]</i>

Would you like to go dancing?
[ Laughs ]

## [ Humming ]
[ Continues Laughing ]

l have to go back to work. l can't-- l really--
You have to do this first, okay?

<i>##[ Continues ]</i>
[ Chuckles, Gasps ]

Tom, come on. Quit messing around.
l can't hold you up.

l can't--
[ Grunts ]

Tom?
What's going on?

l can't feel my legs.

What--
Where does it hurt?

<i>Tom?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

<i>Tom? Tom.!</i>

<i>[ Woman ] The injury probably occurred</i>
<i>during his climbing accident.</i>

There must be something
you can do.

l mean, isn't there any kind
of emergency surgery or anything?

There's nothing
we can do here.

There is a private medical facility in Denmark
that has done testing on this injury.

Okay, then let's go, then.

lt's considered experimental.

Even though it's been highly successful--
We'll try anything.

<i>Your insurance</i>
<i>won't cover it.</i>

How much?
What?

How much does the surgery cost?
We'll pay for it.

Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Okay, w-we'll pay it.
Mom, tell--

<i>Mom, tell her</i>
<i>we'll pay it.</i>

<i>Mom, we</i>-- <i>we can</i>--
<i>we can pay it.</i>

[ Sobbing ]
Mom, tell her we'll pay it. Please.

<i>[ Gus ] Two hundred</i>
<i>and fifty thousand dollars?</i>
Please tell her we'll pay it.

What happens if your dad
doesn't get the operation?

We'll go door to door.

Everyone loves your dad.
They'll give us money.

l could sell
my camera.

<i>lt's $250,000,you guys.</i>

You know how much money
that is?

l have a coin collection.

They're rare.

R--

Well, what if l--
what if l borrow half?

And then l can make--

No, it doesn't exceed that.

Personal collateral?

Uh, we own a go-cart track.

Let's cut to the chase,
shall we, Mrs. Phillips?

You're not qualified
for a personal loan of this size.

l understand, but, uh,
my husband is sick and l was hoping--

Yes. Yes, l'm aware
of that, Mrs. Phillips.

Doesn't it mean anything
that l work for the bank?

But you're freelance, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.

From a security company.

A security company which,
under your guidance...

<i>has been unable</i>
<i>to provide my bank...</i>

<i>with a fully operational security system</i>
<i>in the allotted time...</i>

stated in the contract.

<i>[ Mrs. Phillips Whispers ]</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

Come on, sweetie.

Don't you have a heart?

This is not an emotional issue,
Mrs. Phillips.

A bank has no heart.

<i>Only paper in a vault.</i>

<i>Strange not being able to move.</i>

l've been staring at the same spot
on the ceiling for the past three hours.

Mom can't come up
with the money, Dad.

l escaped death
on that climb, Maddy.

Twenty feet from the summit,
my gear stuck...

but there was this perfect crack
all the way up to the top.

You free-climbed it?

<i>lt was so easy,</i>
<i>l lost concentration and l fell.</i>

<i>But somebody or something was looking out</i>
<i>for me so l could go home...</i>

see you, get to know
what a great girl you are.

ln a way, that fall was the best thing
that could've happened to me.

You know
l'd do anything for you.

Dad, we'll come up with the money.
l promise.

[ Narrator] And lined it
with a 200-foot-high steel chamber...

which houses
the Lion Safe.

The system combines
the best of new technology...

and old tried-and-true
security methods...

making Harderbach Financial
the most secure a bank can be.

The entire system is run
on a tri-motor generator...

making power loss
a virtual impossibility...

<i>meaning the system will remain safe</i>
<i>even in the event of a citywide blackout.</i>

The project began
in the fall of 2000...

and is the largest, most technologically
advanced security install to date...

for any bank
in North America.

The halls are lined with hundreds
of motion-sensitive cameras...

whose images are fed back
to a state-of-the-art security booth.

Until the system
has been fully tested...

the halls will be patrolled after hours
by highly trained attack dogs.

This all leads
to the Lion Safe.

The safe is suspended nearly
1 00 feet off the ground...

and is equipped to hold over $25 million
in cash and gold bullion.

Safety deposit boxes
line the walls of this chamber.

<i>Slated to be finished in April of 2004</i>--
<i>[ Gus ] Are you crazy?</i>

We can't rob a bank.

We'll pay them back.

How?
<i>l don't know. l'll work.</i>

l'll do anything.

You understand what happens
if we get caught, right? We go to jail forever.

Like, until we're 21 .

No one will ever suspect us.

Adults treat us like we're five years old anyway.
How hard could it be?

<i>Tomorrow l'll go to work with my mom</i>
<i>and check out the bank.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, Gus,you need to find out</i>
<i>who the architect is of the bank...</i>

<i>and see if you can get</i>
<i>a floor plan or a model.</i>

<i>And Austin</i>--
<i>Austin'll take care of the dogs.</i>

What dogs?
The Rottweilers.

Vicious killing dogs.

<i>Gus, come on.</i>
<i>This is serious.</i>

<i>Tomorrow, at the bank, l'll try to check out</i>
<i>my mom's security system.</i>

<i>[ Man ] Good morning.</i>
<i>Who's in the car with you today?</i>
<i>My daughter.</i>

<i>[ Maddy ]</i>
<i>l'll take as many pictures as l can.</i>

You guys,
l really need you.

<i>All right. For Mr. P.</i>

For your dad.

<i>[ Mrs. Phillips ]</i>
<i>Okay, Maddy, here we go.</i>

<i>Maddy?</i>

[ Click ]

[ Click ]

[ Sniffs ]

Do you have any idea how fast
you were goin'? Save it, pal.

License and registration.

[ Knuckles Crack ]

<i>[ Club Slams On Desk ]</i>

That... <i>is the eye</i>
<i>of God, Chad.</i>

Do you see these people?
These are not people.

These are snakes in paradise,
waiting for your weakest moment...

<i>any chance you give them.</i>

<i>These people?</i>
<i>Not to be trusted.</i>

<i>Oh.! My sweethearts.</i>

[ Dogs Whimpering ]

<i>Maddy, l love that you wanted to come</i>
<i>to work with me today, sweetheart...</i>

but l have a lot of work to do,
so l need you to keep up.

Can l see the safe?
That's just the old safe.

The real one's upstairs.
What are those?

That's a motion detector.
Can l see the new safe?

<i>And if Miss Fancy-pants Phillips</i>
<i>would have listened to me...</i>

we wouldn't need all this
high-tech flim-flammery.

[ Yells ]
The dogs--

The dogs would have done
all the work.

The dogs and my black belt,
that is.

[ Karate Yell ]

[ Crunch ]
Aaah!

Back to the monitor,
maggot!

Your office is upstairs?

Yeah. l need to be
near the safe.

Whoa. That thing
looks like it's alive.

<i>lt's got a built-in</i>
<i>motion detector...</i>

The guards can't watch all 1 00 cameras
at the same time...

so when the camera picks up movement,
the light goes on and they can see us.

Watch.
Just stay completely still.

Ah. Climber girl.

That's pretty cool.
<i>[ Elevator Bell Dings ]</i>

<i>They'd better fix the l.S.P., because</i>
<i>that whole side of the building is S.O.L.</i>

<i>Molly?</i>
Oh.

l didn't think you were
coming in today.

The party is Friday, so l wanted to make sure
the system is as close as possible.

Yeah. Listen, l spoke with Brisbane
about the loan, and he just wouldn't budge.

<i>l'm really sorry.</i>
<i>Oh, God. We'll have to</i>
<i>figure out some other way.</i>

Would you like a tour?
-<i>Oh, Alan, that's really</i>--

Yeah! That'd be awesome.
Well, great.

We'll start this way.
Don't worry. l'll take good care of her.

Now, we're gonna begin--

<i>l paid that phone bill.!</i>
<i>l paid that phone bill last week.!</i>

Hi. My name's Austin--

Easy.

My name's Austin,
and, uh, l make movies. Director.

Really?
How may l help you?

l got this dog for my birthday, and l was
hoping l could use him as a stunt dog--

What kind of dog
do you have?

A Budweiser?
Rottweiler?

Yeah.
l just happen to be a Rottweiler expert.

There is a really nice
boy here...

who's going to write an essay
about the design of the...

<i>Harderbach Financial building...</i>

and he needs a floor plan drawing
that he can use...

as a visual aid
for his essay.

Are you freakin' nuts?

You can't give bank floor plans to a kid!
You're just--

Normally he's very nice.

<i>But it's a little more difficult</i>
<i>with banks.</i>

l mean, imagine if you were a bank robber--
[ Laughing ]

lt's just that last time
l got a ""C'' on my essay...

because l didn't have
any visual aids.

And my stepdad, he--
Well, he gets a little--

[ Gasps ]
Oh!

Just stay here.

[ Chuckles ]

<i>You can't see it now, but by the party</i>
<i>we are hoping it's</i> primo.

Down here is the security room--
ultra high-tech and cool.

<i>Your mom designed that too.</i>
[ Chuckles ]

<i>Notice the key pads, which are</i>
<i>designed to keep people out of</i>
<i>the important areas of the bank.</i>

Who has the codes
to all these?

Oh, they're different
from room to room.

But l have a code that is
good for the whole building.
Cool.

Come on.

""D-E-N-l-R-O.''

<i>[ Click ]</i>
[ Whispers ] De Niro.

Oh, look at that view.

This is the coolest office
in the building.

<i>lt belongs to the big cheese,</i>
<i>Mr. Brisbane.</i>

Check this out.

Huh?

<i>Huh?</i>
<i>And get this.</i>

Your mom has rigged it so you can control
all the cameras from right here.

You talkin' to me? Huh?

Are you talkin' to me?
[ Chuckling ]

lt's De Niro.

<i>l still do some acting.</i>
<i>This bank manager thing is just temporary.</i>

Come on. You try it.

l don't know
what to say.

Say anything.

Hi.
Disgusting.

Good!

<i>Haah.!</i>

Ooh.

<i>ln this room there's a tunnel</i>
<i>that leads to the safe.</i>

<i>l can only tell you</i>
<i>a little bit about the safe.</i>

<i>Only your mom understands the whole thing.</i>
<i>After all, she designed it.</i>

[ Barking ]
Oh! No! My God!

[ Sighs ]

l can't wait until we get rid of these things.
They get me every time.

<i>Down.! Shh.!</i>

[ Shouting ] Rottweilers respond
to German commands only!

<i>Ausfahrt,</i> Killer.
<i>Ausfahrt.!</i>

Say <i>"Ausfahrt, Killer. '"</i>
Do it, or he'll rip your throat out!

Ass fart!
-<i>Ausfahrt.!</i>

<i>You must show them respect.!</i>

Ouch fart!
<i>[ lmitates Buzzer ]</i>

Wrong answer.

<i>[ Barking ]</i>
Ass fart! Ass fart!

[ Chuckling ]
-<i>No.! Go away.! Ass fart.!</i>

<i>##[ Pop ]</i>

<i>##[ Man Singing ]</i>

Get outta here, kid,
before l turn him loose on you!

<i>No respect.!</i>

Come on! [ Barks ]
<i>##[ Man Continues ]</i>

<i>##[ Woman Joins Man Singing ]</i>

Don't ever tell anybody
where you got it.

l would never.
Thank you.

They're gonna send out a search party for me
if l don't get back to work.

Can you find your way back
to your mom's office?
Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Hartmann.

Okay. Bye.
We'll see you tomorrow.

Mr. Hartmann?
Hmm?

l think you'd make
a really good actor.

Thanks.

<i>[ Maddy ] The party's in two days.</i>
<i>That's when we'll hit the bank.</i>

<i>Austin, how'd it go with the dogs?</i>
The dogs are under control.

<i>[ Maddy ]</i>
<i>Gus, the model looks pretty cool.</i>

<i>[ Gus ] Piece of cake.</i>
<i>l thought that secretary was gonna adopt me.</i>

[ Laughs ]

<i>Do you guys think we can do it?</i>
<i>Do you really think we can get the money?</i>

Are you kidding? Of course.
Yeah. Of course.

l mean, you're, like, the best climber
in the whole state.

<i>Yeah, and Austin's, like,</i>
<i>some freak of nature computer genius.</i>

Yeah, and Gus is--
[ Loud Burps ]

[ Laughs ]

Gus is disgusting.

<i>[ Maddy ] Austin, this should be</i>
<i>exactly the height of the gate at the bank.</i>

<i>Watch carefully, okay?</i>

Okay, Austin, your turn.

<i>The cart</i>
<i>doesn't control you.</i>

You control the cart.

<i>Go.</i>
l got it!

Whoa-- Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

Yikes!

No! Aaah!

ls there any way you can make him
quieter and faster?

<i>Do you want a window</i>
<i>or an aisle?</i>

<i>##[ Man Rapping ]</i>

<i>##[ Continues ]</i>

A hundred P.S.l.

Okay, work for your daddy.

[ Engine Accelerating ]

lt worked!
l'm a genius!

But how am l gonna stop?
Maybe l'm not a genius!

Aaaaah!

<i>[ Maddy ]</i>
<i>Mr. Hartmann's a really nice guy.</i>

<i>Do you have your script?</i>
<i>[ Austin ] l'm the director.</i>
<i>l'm always prepared.</i>

<i>[ Gus, Mocking ]</i>
<i>""l'm always prepared. '"</i>

<i>[ Maddy ] Austin,you just have to get him</i>
<i>to say to turn the alarm</i>--

<i>[ Austin ]</i>
<i>Off.l know, l know.</i>

Come on. Hurry up.
l'm coming.

Wait for me!

<i>Take it easy. Take it easy.!</i>
<i>Take it easy.</i>

All right, here.

Maddy's playing the girl
who's home alone and scared of the dark.

<i>You play her dad,</i>
<i>who walks in just as the alarm blares.</i>

Wh-Wh-What do l do
for a living?

l'm glad you asked.

You work for a specialized branch
of the C.l.A.

Ohh, l like that.
l've always wanted to play an assassin.

Well,
here's your chance.

You are a C.l.A. assassin.

[ Exhales ]
Um, can l get a water, please?

Can l talk to you
for a second? Over here.

Um, okay.

Which is stronger...

hair... or no hair?

l-- l think hair.
Okay.

-<i>Six slick Schick super shavers.</i>
And we're ready.

[ Yawning Noises ]

Okay, this is scene one,
take one.

Sound, speed and...

action.

Dad, is that you?
Hey, take it easy. lt's only me.

You were really good today, Austin.
Seriously. Really good.

l just try to stay out of the way of my actors
and let the magic happen.

Gus, what are you doing?
We have to go over the plan.

Go over the plan
with your boyfriend.

What are you talking about?
He's not my boyfriend.

Oh, so you'd rather go out with Gus.
l never said that--

Are all boys this stupid?
l don't wanna go out with either of you!

lf we're so stupid, then why don't you
just rob the bank yourself?

Fine! l will!
Good luck rigging your go-cart.

Yeah, and have a good time hacking
into the bank's computer by yourself.

This whole bank idea
sucks!

<i>Dad, l have to</i>
<i>talk to you.</i>

<i>l'm gonna steal $250,000</i>
<i>from Mom's bank.</i>

l have to climb a hundred feet
to get to the safe.

Way higher than l've ever,
ever climbed before.

And l have to lie to my two best friends
to get 'em to do it with me.

Well, Maddy...

a hundred feet
is too dangerous.

You know,
that's how far l fell.

Yeah, l know, Dad.

Plus, it's illegal
to steal money.

You know Mom'll get fired
if anyone ever found out.

l thought about
all that, but--

but wouldn't it be worth it if
it means you could get better?

Yeah, Maddy...

it probably would be.

l've been thinking
since yesterday, and...

l love you.

Here. Um,
l have the other half.

Please say all that again.
Stop. Come on.

Promise to help
with the mission?

Yeah.

Just don't tell Gus, 'cause we need him,
and he wouldn't do it if he knew.

He'd be devastated.

What about Austin?
You're much cuter.

l've actually liked you
the whole time.

Yes! l knew it!

Uh, here.

<i>l have the other half.</i>

Promise to help
with the mission?

Okay.
Cool.

<i>[ Maddy ] Okay, guys,</i>
<i>let's go over the plan one last time.</i>

So, l took Maddy's pictures from the bank,
the model that Gus brought home...

and l scanned them
into the computer.

<i>Using those elements,</i>
<i>l created a digital blueprint of the building.</i>

Check it out.

VoilÃ .

Whoa!
That is awesome!

l mean, it's okay...

if you like
that kind of stuff.

Wow.

Here's where
the party's gonna be.

<i>lt'll be mostly contained</i>
<i>in the lobby of the bank.</i>

<i>lt's gonna be pretty fancy,</i>
<i>so we're gonna need to blend in.</i>

<i>Security's on the second floor, so we'll</i>
<i>have to get past your brother and Ferrell...</i>

<i>to get to the elevator that accesses</i>
<i>the ninth floor where the safe is.</i>

Okay, and Austin, you'll hack into the bank's
camera system from Brisbane's office.

Gus, were gonna
make our way to the safe.

<i>lt's suspended a hundred feet</i>
<i>off the ground...</i>

<i>so the only way to get to it</i>
<i>is to climb.</i>

Wow.

<i>Maddy, are you sure you're gonna be able</i>
<i>to make this climb?</i>

<i>l mean, it's double the size</i>
<i>of the water tower.</i>

You guys take care of your jobs.
l'll take care of mine.

<i>They're gonna be doing a lot of tests</i>
<i>on your father tonight at the hospital...</i>

so l wanna be there for that.

l'm gonna need you to look after Max
while l'm gone.

Mom, l can't. l'm going out
with Gus and Austin.

<i>You never think about me.</i>
lf you're not gonna come
to the hospital, then you're--

Mom, l can't, l--
Maddy.

You're gonna babysit
Max tonight. Okay?

That's it.

Oh, one more thing.

l do think about you,
Madeline.

<i>Every day.</i>
<i>All the time.</i>

Nice bandana.

Nice turtleneck.

What's he doing here?
l have to babysit him.

But he's gonna completely ruin
everything we just worked for.

<i>He hasn't made a sound his whole life.</i>
<i>l don't think he's gonna start now.</i>

What if we mess up?

We're my dad's only chance.

You ready?
Let's hit it.

Ooh! Gross!

Mom, Bart was taking
a picture of his butt!

Like l'm really gonna

[ Marge ] Stop it, you two.

Since it's just the four of us

Yay!

Only four of us? Who escaped?

<i>##[ Funk Rock ]</i>

<i>You know, that part?</i>

Aren't those marvelous?
Please let me show you.

<i>These are really quite extraordinary.</i>
<i>The lighting, in particular</i>--

Well, you know--

The, uh, uh--

lt's all clear.

Here you go,
Maddy.

Okay, when l get up there...

l'll try to disable the motion sensors
so you guys can just come up the stairs.

Careful, Maddy.

[ Motor Whirring ]
Maddy! Camera!

Careful.
-<i>[ Whirring Continues ]</i>

<i>[ Man Yelling ]</i>

[ Yelling Continues ]

[ Gus ]
Don't worry. We got it covered.

And strike, and strike,

<i>Aaah.!</i>
<i>[ Shrieking ]</i>

Haah! Hoo!
Oh!

Lieuten--
Ohh!

Lesson one, Chad.

Never take your eyes
off the enemy.

<i>[ Gus On Radio ]</i>
<i>Take this for a test drive.</i>

[ Groans ]

Dude, the way your feet smell,
it's just--

it's not normal.

Whoo!

God, Gus!
[ Groans ]

Oh, my God.

<i>[ Female Computer Voice ]</i>
<i>Motion detected, north staircase.</i>

Check the monitors.
Check the monitors!

l don't see anything.
[ Exhales ]

That's when your enemy is their most
dangerous-- when you can't see them.

This is a test.
l just know it.

l'll go downstairs,
make a round.

[ Exhales ]
You stay here...

and take care
of your... privates.

[ Groans ]

You stay in this booth!

Okay, it worked.

<i>Well, sort of</i>-- <i>Ferrell's gone. But now</i>
<i>Bad Chad's alone in the security booth.</i>

[ Austin ]
Just hold on. We'll think of something.

[ Exhales ]

[ Farts ]

<i>[ Maddy ]</i>
<i>l got it.</i>

l'm gonna distract him.

When l give the signal,

<i>Hey, Maddy,</i>
<i>what's the signal?</i>

[ Radio: Static ]
Maddy!

Get away from Chad!
He's a lunatic!

<i>My brother's crazy. He really thinks</i>
<i>he's a cop. This wasn't part of the plan.</i>

<i>Maddy, don't go in there.!</i>

Hi.

What are you doing here?

l was at the party.
l was totally bored.

What are you doing?

[ Exhales ]
Just my job.

You look different.

Why are you such a jerk
to your brother all the time?
[ Chuckles ] Well--

You know
he completely idolizes you.

Gus?
Yeah.

<i>To him,you're like</i>
<i>Yao Ming or Shaq.</i>

Well, which one?
There's a big difference.

Yao Ming.

Definitely Shaq.
You think?

Yeah, l think so.
[ Chuckles ] Sweet.

He thinks you're gonna be a great cop.
He told me.

Come downstairs with me. The police chief
is here to check on Mom's security system.

<i>You could show him how serious</i>
<i>you are about yourjob.</i>

Ferrell told me not to
leave the booth, but--

l just came from the party.
Don't worry. He's not down there.

[ Both, Simultaneously ]
She winked at me.

-<i>So Gus really thinks l'm cool?</i>
Yeah.

Maybe that's the signal.
Go.

Where's the chief?

<i>[ Ferrell Laughs ]</i>

Well, l like to come up to Mr. Brisbane's

She's not listening to me.

She's climbing up this stupid wall, and--
Austin, maybe she'll listen to you.

<i>Harderbach robbery suspects on the loose.</i>
Alan!

did they get away with?
[ Man ] Who's this?

Uh, she's the head
of security.

Three suspects.
They got away on go-carts.

<i>They hit you for $250,000.</i>

Go-carts?
Yeah. We also found this in the vault room.

They used it to climb
up to the safe.

Do you have the perpetrators in custody?
<i>Not yet.</i>

What l want to know is, why would someone
break into a safe with $25 million...

<i>and steal only $250,000?</i>

Excuse me! There she is! She's our so-called
head of security. This is all her fault!

Actually, Mr. Brisbane, l did--
Uh, Mr. Brisbane, with all due respect...

Molly did tell you that the security system
had not been tested.
<i>Really?</i>

Well, you just got your walking papers.
Didn't you, Hartmann?

Are you talkin' to me?

[ Louder]
Are you talkin' to me?

Well, you must be talkin' to me, 'cause there's
nobody else here. So you must be talkin' to me!

Excuse me.

Monsieur Nuffaut,
l must apologize...

for this strange debacle.

l assure you--
lt's not me you owe an apology to, Brisbane.

[ Speaking ln French ]
lf the head of security told you...

<i>the system is not ready,</i>
<i>then it seems like a</i>--<i>how do you say</i>--

a knucklehead move
to go ahead with this soiree.

<i>On y va, chÃ©rie.</i>

Oh, FranÃ§ois!

Mom, l have--
l have the money. We can go.

[ Sighs ]

Molly, what is--
what is this?

l warned him...

<i>that the system</i>
<i>wasn't online yet.</i>

l know.

And to prove to everyone...

just how vulnerable
the bank was...

l had my daughter and her two friends--
three kids-- rob the bank.

<i>And l think if you look</i>
<i>in my contract,you will see...</i>

<i>that l have a license</i>
<i>to perform undisclosed tests to the system...</i>

until such date as the system
is deemed fully operable.

<i>Are you buying</i>
<i>any of this?</i>

Yeah.

<i>Molly was authorized</i>
<i>to hire consultants...</i>

<i>to test the system.</i>

This was all a plan--

<i>a brilliant plan.</i>

All right.
Could you step back, please?

[ Shutters Clicking ]

<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Mrs. Phillips</i>-- <i>Mrs. Phillips, is it true...</i>

<i>your daughter is a leading suspect</i>
<i>in the robbery?</i>

<i>[ Man ] Sir?</i>
<i>Mrs. Phillips, please?</i>

Ready? We understand three children
were involved in the high-speed pursuit...

ending up here
at Community Wide Hospital.

Details are sketchy,
but it appears the children...

have robbed Harderbach Financial
of nearly a quarter-million--

And a source inside the bank
is saying the robbery...

was actually some type of plot
to test the bank's security--

<i>Now, stories are swirling,</i>
<i>but this reporter has learned...</i>

that one of the children has a father
in desperate need of an operation.

The child
has not been identified...

but her father is registered
in the hospital as Tom Phillips.

<i>Now, Mr. Phillips runs a local go-cart track,</i>
<i>and is expected to return home tomorrow...</i>

since insurance will not cover his operation.
Maddy?

l'm Maria Quiban,
Channel 1 0 News.

[ Sighs ]
You know what you did was wrong.

Yeah, l know.
And l know l haven't really been there for you.

But that's gonna change. Okay?

l love you.
l love you too, Maddy.

You have such a big heart.

You guys gotta come down the track.
You're not gonna believe this.

They're coming.
[ Cheering, Applauding ]

What are they doing?

Waiting to buy tickets.
Come on. Let's go.

Hey, Maddy.
Hey.

Skip, the tickets
are only three bucks.

Keep the change. Tell your dad to feel better.
Thanks.

That's three dollars.
Well, here's a hundred from my parents.

Thank you.
Wait. Here's your ticket.

Six dollars. Here you go.
Tell Mr. P, ""Feel better.''

Ho-ho.

<i>[ Mrs. Phillips ] How much?</i>
400.

[ Keystrokes ]

Here's two here.
[ Quietly ] Wait. Plus--

Well?

<i>Even with the donations</i>
<i>from the news station, we're still short.</i>

<i>[ Knocking On Door ]</i>
Molly?

Mr. Hartmann.
You forgot something--

<i>the consultant fee for the company</i>
<i>you hired to pull off the robbery.</i>

[ Chuckles ]

Holy--
$50,000?

<i>Ah. The hair.</i>
<i>The hair.</i>

Well, that should
get you pretty close.

And the president of the bank has authorized
any personal loan to cover the difference.

Mr. Brisbane
already said that--

l'm afraid he's not with the bank anymore,
so call me for whatever you need.

[ Sighs ] Thank you so much.
<i>You're welcome.</i>
