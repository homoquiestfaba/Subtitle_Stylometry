Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

Man down! Cease fire!

Stupid motherfucker!

<i>Sí.</i>

What's up, Sylvia?

Cute little outfit.

You look nice.

Mike's in
the bedroom.

Yeah?

Man, I said
you look nice.

I have a court
appearance, Jim.

Well, you just
give 'em hell.

Hey.

Spiffy duds, huh?

You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

I have two filings
and a deposition today.

Play nice, kids.

What up, dog?

Nothing. Just got back.
Cool. Cool.

How was Mexico, dog?

Oh, it was a dream, man.

Loving my woman.
Right.

That's it.
I'm out of here.

Those are copies
of your resumé.

Pass them out like candy.

'Cause I can always
print up more.

And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

And no drinking.

Come on, baby, be cool.

Honey, I'm serious.

No drinking. Okay?

I love you.
I love you, too.

Good luck.

Your suit's fine, okay?

Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

She's pissed.

Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

and a pack of GPCs.

Caught a buzz
and watched

my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

That's on you, homie.

We didn't even
hang yesterday.

I was out of the country.

So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

Huh? Huh? Hmm?

Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

and find my ass
some employment.

It's cool you driving me around?

Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

<i>Here, asshole.</i>

Breakfast.

Oh... ho, ho...

Dog.

No <i>pisto</i> for me, dude.

Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

Good. More for me.

Fuck it.

<i>Salud.</i>
<i>Salud.</i>

Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

I can't pay my rent.

Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

The tax-free shit?

Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

I guess we drank
up the rest.

Dumb ass.

Cops better start
paying you, dude.

You spend enough
fucking time with them.

They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

Another test, another two weeks.

Fuck.

Shit gets real,

you be hating life.

Party time will be over.

Dude, you don't know how much

I'm looking forward
to this shit.

You know, I'll be super recruit.

I was jumping
out of choppers

in the mountains,
taking down

hard motherfuckers,
you know?

I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

Shit, they're
gonna love me.

Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

Ah, fuck you.

I'm going to love my old lady.

I'm gonna marry homegirl.

Import her ass.

Oh, come on, man.

Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

You're fucking up the plan.

I've been thinking, you know?

Love's about sacrifice.

Only true measure of it.

What would you do for Sylvia?

Get a job.

Mm...
Nine to fucking five.

Yeah.

That's love.

Hey.

Good morning.

So when do you officially

hand your ass over to the Man?

"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

I had two beers, right?

Yeah.

Going fucking
blind or something.

Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

What the fuck does that mean?

Come on, dude.

"no longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

They pulled the plug, dude.

No, no...

Why?

Oh, man, I'll bet you...

I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

I am fucked.

I got to get married.

Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

unless I got employment.

I promised her.

This fucks up my plan.

This is fucking bullshit, okay?

This... these fucking
assholes...

These fucking assholes!

What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

I mean you're trippin', dude.

Hey, what the fuck

are you looking at, asshole?!

Fucking dick.

Yo, yo,

Jim, Jim...

I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

You fucking want some?

Jim, Jim, dude.

Kick back, dude.

The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

Man, fuck.
You're going to catch

a case doing that shit, man.

What the fuck were you doing?

Fuck the LAPD, man.

What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

L.A. City's the shit.

Hey, Sheriff's Department.

It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

They make you work
the jails the first two years

or something.

I could be cracking heads

up at the Honor Ranch.

I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

Yeah.

That's right.

Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

Quit trippin', dude.

Shit.

Hey, you know what
I want to do?

What?

I want to get fucked up.

Me, too, man.

I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

Come on.

Bye, Nicole.
Bye.

Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

Sorry, you buy whole pack.

Be cool, dude.

If I buy a whole pack

I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

City give me $1,500 ticket.

No more.

Asshole.

Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

Oh, shit.

That fucking gangster, man.

Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

You think we'll be able
to go back there?

I hate that shit.

Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

We totally look like cops.

He said he got fined
for that shit.

He was just being cautious.

Well, we got <i>pisto</i>,
we got <i>frajos</i>.

Only one thing missin'.

Be-at-ches.

Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

<i>Yesca?</i>
Mm-hmm.

Bingo.

I need to feel
some reefer madness.

You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

Fuck this purity bullshit.

Yeah... fuck purity.

Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

Stupid-ass cholo.

Look at that.

That dude's slangin', dog.

Want to get
a dime?

No, I want it all.

Go for the stash, man.

Whoa, go, go, go.

Hey, hey, yo, yo.

That's my shit!

Fuck.

Outstanding.

Out-fucking-standing.

That shit was slick.

That motherfucker
just got schooled.

Bitch-ass cholo.

Check this shit out, huh?
Yeah.

Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

Mm. It's not laced either.

Smell that shit.

Smell that motherfucking shit.

We just burned my car.

We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

Yeah, no shit.

Man, bust that light.

Roll that shit up.

Yeah, yeah, Cool.

Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

Then we'll smoke out, dude.

Some resumés.

Yeah.

Ah, man, fresh air.

Look.

Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

You fucking asshole, man.

I got to get
a fucking job, man.

What's your problem, man?

What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

Yo, Mike, first day looking--

nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

I got to get a job for sure.

This is your job, man.

So act like a fucking
professional,

spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

It's harsh. It's good, though.

You okay?

How are those lungs, baby?

There it is.

That magic feeling.

Damn, look at that bitch.

Oh, damn.

Fuck, yeah.

She's fucking good.

I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

You just saw your woman.

Only hit her once, man.

We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

Lock and key.

Fuck, I want to get laid.

Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

Online, pornmeister.

Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

How much you want to bet
I hit it.

She won't, dog.
How much you want to bet?

She won't give you shit, dog.

You big time
fucked her over.

Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

I got that mind control, man.

How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

20 bucks?

You ain't got 20 bucks.

So, neither do you, man.

Come on, shake on that shit.

Come on.

What the fuck, let's go.

I got it.

What's up, Patty?

<i>Y tu hermana?</i>
She ain't here.

<i>Y sabes que?</i>

You're not welcome
in this house.

Sure, Patty.

I'd love to come in.

Thank you.

Are they here?

You're looking fine,
as fuck, <i>chulas</i>.

Don't... don't touch
me, please.

Hey, hey.

You got to get out of here.

Letty...

I just wanted
to see you again.

Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a <i>pisto</i> or something?

I ain't grabbing you shit.

Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

Laters. I'm going to my room.

You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

Baby.

Let's sit down.

No, no, no.

So, um...

You a cop yet?

I'm working on it.

<i>Y tu?</i>

<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

It's good you're doing
positive shit.

What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

Oh, come on, come here.

Yeah.

Don't.

Jim, I got a boyfriend.

Who?

Flaco.

You're back with that

piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

You're not fucking him, are you?

Please tell me no.

Yes. So... just go.

'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

See?

Okay?

I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

You're too good for that.

You gotta go.

Go. Please!

Let me talk to them.

No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

Okay? <i>Largate.</i> Just go.

I guess it's later days.

<i>Largate.</i> Just go!

Flaco, the <i>pinchi guero</i>'s here!

<i>Apuarte,</i> Jim!
Hurry up!

Leave him alone!

Pop the fucking trunk!

Jim!

Oh, you fucked up!

Get your fucking knees

Get the fuck

Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

What's your problem, Flaco?

Motherfucker!

Fucking knees on the curb, man!

That's right!

Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

You deaf fuck!

Yo, Mike.

Yeah?

Do up their ride.

Freeze, bitch!

I'm going to take that big ass

hit it for a minute, you know?

Fuck off!

Now you got it.

Yo, relax, homie.

You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

Fuck!

Hey, <i>haina</i>.

Whoo!

Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

What you got down here?

Oh...

Liking that.

Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

Lucky you got little bitch feet,

Fuck you, <i>puto</i>.
Huh?

Yeah. Fuck you.
Yes?

You fucking stay still!

Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

<i>ese</i>, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.

Not fucking shit!

Hey, later, Patty!

I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

you wanted me to blow in you.

Fuck you!

Bye, Letty!

<i>Salud.</i>

Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

I know I got more than that.

Yeah. Here we go.

Shit.

That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

Homeboy uses extra large.

Man, that's it?
Next time,

jack someone with a job.

Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

Check it out.

Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

14, plus one in the chamber.

It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

It's brand-new.

It's a BB gun.

Yeah. Cool.

Here you go, dog.

About time you got a <i>cohete</i>.

No. I don't want it.

Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

That's a good reason. Sell it.

How much you think
we can get for the gun?

Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

You sure?

It's cool, dude.

50-50.

Good BB gun though.

Shoot some birds and shit.

Hey, put that shit away.

Looks real as hell.

Not a bad day's work.

Get down to business though.

I know you didn't get any.

So pay up, motherfucker.

Dick.

Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

We have reviewed your resumé,

and would like
to make an appointment

for later in the week.

Please call me at your

earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Huh? That's good.

One more? This is fun.

Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

No, no, no. no.
That's it, dude. That's it.

I get too many callbacks,

Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

Not if she
recognizes your voice.

Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

Come on.
I'm cool.

I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

Come on, bro. One brew.

All right, but hey,

I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

to be looking
for work, man.

Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

I got to find a job, too.

Hello.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir. That is correct.

Six years.

Honorably discharged.

Yes, sir.

I would love to.

Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

Tomorrow

is not a problem.

Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

Good-bye, sir.

That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

sir, sir."

Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

The Federal man!

Department of
Homeland Security

wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

Oh, shit!

Fucking A, my brother!

That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

It's on, homie!

Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

I got to take a piss test.

If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

Yeah! Oh!

Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

Oh, shit!

You fucked up, man.

Oh, fuck.

I fucked up.

Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

Fuck! Oh...

You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

And they will burn me

with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

Shit!

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

Right? Relax, dude.
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

I'll pass that shit.

Hell, yeah. Yeah.

Of course
you will, dude!

Later, loco.

Don't fucking trip, dude.

All right.

Shit.

Eat.

Come in, dumb ass!

What's up, dog?

What up, dog...

Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

Sure.

Want some eggs?
There's extra.

Yes, ma'am. Please.

I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

Sorry about that.

I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

Yea. Me, too.

Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

You know, you being a cop.

Tell her what's up, dude.

Well, I applied

to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

They want me to come in today
and start testing.

Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

Well, I got a urinalysis today.

If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

and then I could
be out of here next month.

You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

Yeah, sure.
Yeah, bro.

Three callbacks.

Damn! Good!

We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

Got more.

Yeah!
Yeah!

Well, you have
to keep trying

until something happens.

Finding a job <i>is</i> a job, right?

Lunch money.

Thank you.

And good
luck today.

Thank you.

Love you.
I love you, too.

Good luck.

And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

I hope you studied.

I'm going to
cram for it.

Man, that's freaky.

She was in
a good mood.

Breakfast
and beer money?

Yeah, dude.

She heard the
messages last night.

She got me a sixer.

I slammed two last night.

Out-fuckin'-standing!

Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

Yeah.

Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

Dude, you <i>had</i> a good job,

with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

Had, dude. <i>Had.</i>

All right? All that
shit's in India now.

Want a cold one?
No, later.

You got any vinegar?

Vinegar? What for?

Ah...

Oh...

Damn, dude!

Ah...!

Man!
That is fuckin' sick, man.

What'd you do that for?

Shuts down the old kidneys.
Ooh.

Come on, let's roll.

Grab me that bag, dude.

Little trick I learned
in the service.

Aw, that's sick, dude.

You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

Quit looking, faggot.

You wish.

Oh, man.

Fuckin'...

shit, dude.

Oh, fuckin' shit...

Aw...

Aw, motherfucker!

Whew!

Ah...

That was...

unpleasant.

Man...

Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

You know, my teeth are floating.

Oh...

You get those
in the military, dog?

I was a Ranger.

Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

Hey!

Let's play nice,

boys.

I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

and dated, am I right?

Yes, sir.

Good. I'm Agent Richards.

Jackets off.

I will now administer
the easiest test

Homeland Security
will ever give you,

the whizz quiz.

Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

Wiggle your fingers.

Let me see
both sides.

Beautifully done.

Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

Detweiler, is it?

You're with me.

Fucker.

Next!

Name?

Davis, Jim.

Ah, the Ranger.

Yes, sir.

You serve?
101st.

High speed.
All right.

Think you can fill that, son?

I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

Yes, sir.

Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

I don't want my head
blown off

just when I'm getting
it straight.

Pop! What's it like

to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

You tell me.

You were busting heads
for the military.

I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

But I will tell you one
thing-- you point and shoot,

pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

you move the fuck on.

You do not stop
and <i>think</i> about it.

It's not a big deal.
So if it's nothing,

then what you getting
all mad for?

I'm not getting mad.

I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
Then what were they?

You know what they were--
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

terrorists, the bad guys.

Did you like it?
Oh, shit.

Did you dig it?

You bust a nut?

Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

You're killing my buzz, dude.

Aw, kick back, stress case.

Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

Hell, yeah.

Let's sell this
fuckin' piece.

Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

Pop! Pop! Pop!

Yo, Darrel!

Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

Fucked his shit up, you know?

Quick as shit, too.
That crack-crack!

Turned that <i>vato</i> into
a fountain of blood.

Why the fuck

That shit could have been

Money, drugs, bitches,
respect, whatever.

That homie, straight-up pimp.

You know, maybe he turned out
that dude's daughter.

Looney tunes and shit,

in his fuckin' neck.

Did you see all that fuckin'
blood over there?!

Yeah, man, the human body's

She had that proper thickness.

Look at me, dog.

Look at me.

I'm fuckin' traumatized

Yo, homie, that shit

Oh, man,

Trashcanistan.

My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

He didn't want to, but he did.

I got to face my woman.

How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

Man, you'll do it, player.

Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

Yeah. Where have you been?

Oh, Jim's pad.

You been drinking?

Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

A few?
Yeah.

You look wasted.

Don't trip, girl.

I've been working
all day.

I've been looking
for work all day.

I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

You know what?

When I'm working,
you can lounge.

I'll fix this place up,

get you nice clothes
and stuff...

Mike, Mike, Mike.

It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

Come here.

Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

Hey, it's not
about stuff.

It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

Right.

Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

and I'm gonna always

owe you for that.
Right.

Now everything's flipped

and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

I mean, you sneak
around like one.

Oh-ho!

Look... Wow, dude.

I'm sorry.

Be cool, baby girl,

I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

and this black guy,
he was the office manager

and he's fuckin' hella cool,

you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

Did you, did you
check the messages?

Four messages.

Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

Honey, this is great!

Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

You better call him
first thing in the morning.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

You just stood there

and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

You should be
the lawyer.

How could you just do that?

How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

I'm sorry.

I'd rather you hit me.

I'm your clown.

I'm your fucking clown.

And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

No, it's not...

No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

Go cook up more lies.

You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

Dude, how could you say
that shit?

I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

Yeah, right, right.

I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

Right now your word
is less than shit.

Maybe you should go.

Just fuckin' go.

Just fuckin'... just go, right?

Fuck it.
I'll fuckin' go!

Please, go. Go!

Fuck it then!
I'll fuckin' go!

Then go, Mike!

I'm serious!
I'll fuckin' go

except I won't fuckin'
come back!

You want me to fuckin' go?!

Fuckin' go, Mike!

I'll fuckin' go then!

I'll fuckin' go!

Get the fuck outta here!

Hello?

Speaking.

Of course, sir. Absolutely.

Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

Thank you, sir.

Who was that?

That was the feds,
my friend.

I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

and they would like me
to go in this morning

to start formal testing.

Fuck yeah, dude.

I'll be there all day,

so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

Let's go.

Oh, shit!

Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

I slept like a baby.

I heard screaming.

What kind of tests?

Psychological tests.

Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

Don't answer that shit
honestly.

Hell no.

They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

to detect deception.

They ask the same shit

six different ways.
It's lame.

You'll ace it.

Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

All I needed was a shot.

Gotta play the system.

Like a piano.

You done
with that crap, son?

Yes, sir.

Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

Bring that with you.

I see dumb people.

We reviewed
your LAPD package.

Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

we're going with
their paper.

Navy sucks.
Army swallows.

Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

from their people.

They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

Move it, dirt bag.

Why'd they drop me?

Someone here make a call?

Nope.

They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

You blew
their profiles.
