(instrumental
theme music plays)

(inmates yelling, jeering)

(jeering continues)

Inmate's voice: Looking back on
it now, I should've seen it coming.

I thought we had it
all figured out...

we had the money...

we had the connections.

This deal, we were
going to be players.

What are you
tripping on, Paulie?

I ain't tripping.

What the fuck
you mean, "tripping"?

You're looking tense.
Don't worry about it.

Everything's going
to be cool.

I know, man.
I'm fucking cool.

Tell me about these guys.

Don't worry about that.

These guys are major league.

Just make sure
your people are cool,

because these dudes
do not fuck around.

(metal rattles)

Fucking rat.

Are you sure you're okay?

I'm fucking cool. Why?

You got the money, right?

Yeah. Yeah.

Rooster's got it...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who? What?

Rooster? That psycho fuck?
Calm down, Slim.

You know I don't like dealing
with that psycho fuck.

Don't worry.
Bullshit, "Don't worry."

He's going to be here
any second.

All right?
Where the fuck is he?!

Any second.

Well, he better be,
because it's down time.


Hey, Tay.
What's up, Slim?

What up with your boy?
I don't like meeting new niggas.

Maybe I don't want
to fucking meet this toad.

I'm the fucking money
in this, man.

What the fuck do you think
you're pointing at?

I'm the fucking man
that makes it happen.

Tay: We don't get down
like that, man.

You'll have
to excuse my partner.

He has a nasty habit
of talking out of his asshole.

What the fuck, Slim?

You ever get my product?

Tay: Mm-hmm.
Slim: Mm-hmm.

You know how we do it.
Slim: This is the shit.

Nothing but A-1.

So, check it out.
Where's the money at?

Well...

What's up, playboy?
Where's the money at?

It's gonna be here
in a second, man.

The guy's gonna...
Aw, shit.

Listen, I thought the money
was going to be here too,

but there's been
a little bit of a glitch.

But don't worry.
It's gonna be here any second.

The fucking guy...

I've known the guy
all my life.

He's gonna be here.
Just be cool.

I'll stake my life
on it, man.

The guy's...
You just did.

Slim: Come on, why don't
we just settle down, guys?

(knocking)
Get the door, Paulie.

Get the fucking door!

It's Rooster. All right?
You got it, right?

What did I say?
My boy Rooster comes through.

Freeze! Hey!
Freeze, don't move!

Slim's voice:
This was big.

Bigger than all of us.

And I was going down.

(inmates yelling)

What do we got here, Jack?

Jack: We got
a regular cowboy here.

This one's a serious operator.

A real fucking Einstein, huh?

Yeah, I've wanted to take
this punk down for a while.

I'll get with the D.A. And see
how he wants to handle this.

All right.
I'll catch up with you later.

One more like him, Jack,
and you'll be bucking for captain.

I'm just doing my job.
You know how it is.

It looks like "Einstein"
is in for a real ride.

All right, cowboy,
get the fuck up.

Then they stick me in this room
with this DEA creepy fuck,

trying to grill me.

Like I was going
to break weak with this fool.

He was clueless.

They had no idea
what really went down.

Agent: Come on, Williams,
make it easy for yourself.

Slim: They kept trying to get me
to confess to something.

I got nothing to say
to you guys.

You aren't looking
so good, Williams.

What's wrong?
Feeling sick, huh?

I bet you're starting to feel

like you want a little dope
right about now, huh?

We can take care of that.

Fuck you.

You think you're real tough,
don't you?

You ain't gonna be so tough when
some nigger is going up your ass.

Get out of here.
You make me sick.

(screams, sobbing)

(inmates yelling)

Guards! Guards!

You better get this sick
motherfucker out of my cell!

Aw, motherfucker!

Get the fuck up!

You better get this asshole
out of here before I kill him!

Slim: I was so sick
I could barely walk.

It seemed like forever
before I reached my cell.

It was only when I stood
in front of that cell door

that I realized my situation.

In that moment,
the sickness left me...

and the void was filled
with fear.

It is truly amazing
how sobering fear can be.

I was sick for weeks.
But I kept it to myself.

I didn't want anybody
thinking I was weak.

The whole time
I was jonesing,

just thinking about how
this nightmare came down.

Me, Gina and Paulie
were going to be players.

But Paulie had fucked up
the biggest deal of our lives.

The more I thought about it,

the more I realized Paulie
was always a rat.

It was just the first time
I got bit.

I've been playing
this game so long,

I was playing it
when you were in diapers,

sucking on
your mama's titties.

Come on. Show me
what you got, bro'.

Show me what you got.

Yeah. Come with it.

I've been playing
this game so damn long,

I got the instructions
from Moses.

Damn!

Fuckers were playing
with wood.

Let me show you
how to work it.

Show me what you got.

Damn!

(vocalizing rhythm)

Damn!

Uh-huh. Yeah.

Get to that.


What are you doing
back there in that corner?

Go on, say it loud.
(banging continues)

Been in there far too long.
Far too long.

You know what they say...

"More than three shakes,
you're playing with yourself."


What's up?

Billy:
You done broke the law again.

Sounds like one of you boys
would like to be shaking it for me.

Excuse me, sir,
you dropped your dick.


On account of your mama ain't here,
I thought you might help out.

You got a mama?

Big man: He got a mama.
I just got up off her.

Hey, that's how motherfuckers
get their ass stuffed.

I watch violence
day in and day out.

People don't realize
that everyday civility

we all take for granted...
it's a joke.

I mean, you put men
in a cage...

all that civility goes
out the window.

What you got left
is a bunch of fucking animals.

Break the bread, brother.

Hey, man!

Jump his ass!
Stomp him!

White bread.

I mean, it gets to you.

It's bad enough when some
little punk gets fucked off,

but when a big corn-fed motherfucker
starts squealing like a pig,

it does something to you, man.

It fucks with your head.

'Cause you know
if they can do him like that,

what are they going to do
to your little dope-sick ass?

It's just a matter
of time, right?

(gates banging)

One night,
the gates racked.

A new guy was brought down
the tier.

I knew this big fuck
was gonna be trouble.

He was a predator.

I could tell he was sizing up
the situation.

He was just trying to decide
who he was gonna take down.

This is how it always works.

They just yell, "Man down."

The guards come in
and cart them away.

No questions asked.

Man:
Look who they let out.

They bring in
a crazy motherfucker like that,

it brings up the pressure
in the tank.

This guy
was straight "5150."

He was freaking
everybody out.

I could tell he was just
trying to size me up

to see if I was weak.

By that time I'd been there
quite a while.

I had what they called
the "Cadillac bunk."

I think he was trying
to figure out

if anybody was gonna
back my play.

After dinner,
he made his move.


Guard: Doors!

What up, 'wood?

I ain't your 'wood.
You're gonna be my bitch

is what you're gonna be.
And I'm gonna take your shit.

What the fuck
are you gonna do, huh?

Do whatever you're going
to do, I guess.

(inmates cheering)

Inmate:
Fuck him up, Slim!

When it happens,

when you take him down...

oh man.

Something inside you...

it's like you get this...
it's fucking amazing,

you get this feeling
of exhilaration.

You feel dominant.

You feel powerful.

It's almost erotic.

After that,
things went pretty smooth.

I got some respect.

Oh, that sweet,
sweet scent.

I can smell...
the doctor.

You got something
there for me?

Fredrickson?

I know you got something
in there for me.

Murphy!

A little something
for my... throbbing.

Furlough!

Something in there
for me...

Guard: Get back. Get your meds,
get the hell away from the bar.

Sorry, ma'am,
they're freaking animals.

It's okay. I don't pay them
any attention.

I'll give you my big bone.

Damn.

I knew he was going to have a
hard time the first time I saw him.

He's what they call
"chicken"...

fresh meat.

And I could tell they were
particularly excited about him.

Pough:
Hey, baby. Hey, baby!

Come on with that shit.
Hey, baby.

Hey, baby!

Mary had a little lamb...

Find out what he did.

So, whitey,
what are you in for?

Stealing somebody's
lunch money, or what?

I don't really...

Huh?
What did you say?

Murder...
I'm in for murder.

Murder!

All:
Oh, no!

We have us a regular
serial killer.


You can see
he's scared shitless.

Billy, what's up? You want him
for your bitch or what?

You've been down too long.
I've been down?

I'm gonna have him down here
in a little while.

That's what I'm gonna
have down for a long time.

Long time!
Yeah! Come on!

Come on out, baby.
We ain't gonna hurt you.

We'll be nice to you.
Come on.

Pough:
Tear that ass up!

Billy ain't gonna babysit
your ass too long.

You can run,
but you can't hide.

Word, Billy.
That's right!

Uh-huh.
I know.

So what's up?

Want to play?

What?

You talking to me?

Who do you think
I'm talking to?

Yeah, I'll play.
What are you guys playing?

Hearts.

I know how to play that.


I don't think you do.

Sit down and we'll show you
how the game is played.

Cool.

So what's your name?
Johnny.

So, "Johnny Boy"...

who the fuck did you kill,
your babysitter?


Man, that's cold.

Johnny, murder's a pretty
heavy rap. What happened?

I was at the drive-in
with a buddy of mine,

we were in his truck,

and he had the stereo
cranked up real loud.

We were all fucked up,
you know?

And this big guy
just came out,

told my friend to turn it down,
and he wouldn't.

Then suddenly it was like
this guy snapped, you know?

And he just started beating
my friend right in the face.

Just whaling on him
over and over and over.

And I had my blade,
you know,

and I just wanted
to scare him.

I didn't mean to...

L-I didn't mean to do it.

Shut up!

Motherfucker's dead.

That's it, and that's all.

Save that crying shit
for the judge,

or I'll kick your...
Knock it off, man.

Pough: Don't be hurting
my baby down there.

Johnny, listen up.

You're in here now.

You're gonna have to start
dealing with this shit.

Now, pay attention.

You don't have to do
nothing with Daddy.

Dude, you need
to put the "ugly" on.

What's that?
The motherfucking ugly.

You need to get an attitude or
your ass is going to get tore up.

That's right.

Guns, motherfucker!

Big guns!

I'm not into working out.

(laughter)
Well, that may be,

but it's better
than some sick bastard

rooting around
up in your guts,

if you know what I'm
talking about?

All right.
Let's play.

When they did
the evening count...

he begged the guard to move him
to another cell block.

I smell my little
white tender.


(inmates yelling)

How you doing?
Johnny Boy!

I told you, you're gonna
get it up in your ass!

Let's do it!
Right here!

The inevitable happened.

Inside, all things
take their course.

(Johnny howling)

I can't describe the feelings that
went through me at that moment...

but I do remember thinking,
"Better him than me."


When Johnny-boy
took himself out like that,

I started thinking about
the precious things in life.

I started thinking
about Gina.

(rock music plays)

Bitch.
Williams, you have a visitor.

Yeah, you idiot,
I'm talking to you.

What the fuck
is his problem?

It can't be a girlfriend.
It must be your mom.


This sucks

This sucks

This sucks!

This sucks

This sucks, this sucks
this sucks

This sucks

This sucks, this sucks

This sucks.

This sucks

This sucks

This sucks

This sucks.

They first came at me
with this deal for 20 years.

I'm thinking to myself,
"What kind of deal is that?"

I mean, they were trying
to break me.

I knew it.

They knew that I knew
that they knew it.

You know.

So the only option
was to wait them out.

I told them that they
were gonna have to come at me

with something better
than that,

or I'm gonna go to trial.

It's all part of the game.

Pough:
What are you tripping on?

Man, I'm thinking
about my family.

Mose: Oh, damn.
I'm thinking about my wife...

Don't go there, Billy.
Don't go there, bro'.

I'm thinking
about my boy.

You got a boy, Billy?
Oh, yeah, I got a boy.

And I was thinking about the smile
that he gets on his face...

Come on, man.
Let's go to sleep. Shit.

Billy: Beautiful smile.
How you gonna go there?

You got to think...
You can't do that, Billy.

I'm thinking about
these motherfuckers...

Watching my back. Every damn day.
Every day.

While you're in here...
you got to think about them.

You can't forget them.

Mose: No, you can't do that.
I can't do that, man.

Tell me about your family.

Billy, you tripping.

I got three kids,
beautiful fucking wife.

Blessed, man!
Woman will follow me to the fire.

But I got to live
in this motherfucker.

I can't go there.

I can't go there and survive
in this motherfucker.

I'll tell you where
I'm gonna go, though.

I'm gonna take
my motherfucking ass to sleep.

Mose:
Fuck that shit, dude.

I'm telling you, man, I'll never
forget this as long as I live.

Me and my buddy, right,
we're in Washington D.C.

We are tripping
our brains out,

and we're being walked in the
central cell block... two white boys.

They walk us into this cell...
it's me, my buddy

and about 30 black guys on
the other side of the cell, right?

When we walk in there,
the biggest,

ugliest motherfucker of them
all looks across at us and says,

"Oh, fresh, white meat."

I about shit my pants
right then.

But my buddy,
he don't miss a beat.

He looks right at him
and says,

"Fuck y'all niggers!

I don't pack shit... ain't none
of y'all niggers packing mine!"

Man, I thought
we were dead meat right there.


Is today Tuesday?
It's Wednesday, huh?

What the fuck does it
matter what day it is?

If it's Wednesday,
it's "shit on a shingle" day.

I can't believe
you guys eat that shit.

Oh, man, "shit on a shingle"
is the fucking best.

All right!
It is Wednesday!

"Shit on a shingle."
Check it out.

Slim: Shit.

What's the matter,
you don't want yours?

Slide it right on down.

I still can't believe
you eat that shit.

What are you
talking about, man?

"Shit on a shingle"
is damn good.

You don't want it?
Kick it on over here.

Knock yourself out.

Don't you know
"shit on a shingle" is brain food?

Yeah, it gives you
shit for brains.

Man, you're fucking crazy.
"Shit on a shingle..."

that's the shit.

They finally came at me
with a deal.

Eight years.

I knew it wasn't going
to get any better than that,

so I took it.

I was just happy to get out
of the madness of county jail.

Go to prison,
get on with doing my time.

Man: Whores.

Those fucking whores.

They all laughed at me.

Those wicked little sinners.

Thought they were
too good for me.

I showed them...

didn't I?

I took it...

and I made them like it.

You're not laughing now,
are you?

I killed you dead.

I cut that nasty little cunt
up into pieces...

Into little
bite-sized pieces.

Hey.

They think they can stop me.

But they're fools.

These walls...

these walls can't...

stop me.

You want to know why?

God loves me.

God came and spoke to me.

I do God's work.

He made me who I am.

Son, do you know God?

Fuck you! Get the fuck
out of my face!

Take God into your heart
and He will set you free.

Get the fuck out of my face.
He set you free, didn't he?

So you can go out
and kill those women.

Now get the fuck
away from me.

Freak!

It was bad enough
having to deal

with the heat and smell
of my own stink,

but those motherfuckers put me
in a holding cell with a maniac.

This freak was a straight
serial killer.

Hey, you know those women?

The ones we've been
talking about?

Those whores?

God sent me down here
to deliver them from their sins.

To rain righteousness
upon them.

I'm sick of hearing you
muttering that shit.

You're a real big man,
aren't you?

Think you're a big man
'cause you killed them women?

I ought to stomp
your ass right now.

The Lord calleth me
to do His work.

The Lord calleth me
to do His work.

You shut the fuck up.
You close your mouth.

Hey, buddy,
you play cards?

The big day
had finally arrived.

I was being transferred
to prison.

I'd been in that cell
so long...

I figured anything had to be
better than staying there.

What are you in for?

Drugs.

What happened?

I don't know.

One moment I was
flying high as a kite,

next moment, I was in here.

I don't know what
I'm going to do now.

I guess a lot of time.

So, what's your name?

Joe.

My name is John.

Let's go.

Corner pocket.

Okay, you two gentlemen
over in the corner.

Okay, let's go.

Go ahead down to the van.

Guard:
Let's go, you guys.

Hey, homes, what's up with you
talking to that "toad," man?

I don't know.
He's cool.

You ever been to the pen before?
No.

How much time you bring?
Eight years.

Man, if you want to be a "reg"
or a "lop," it's on you.

Those stand-up peckerwoods
are going to smoke,

eat, drink, talk
after the "toad."

I see.
That nigger's...

Man, fuck you,
motherfucker!

I got your "nigger" over here,
motherfucker!

I'll see you on the mainline.

We'll see.

(inmates jeering)

Come on!

"Sammytown" basically
gave me his blessing.

He knew I was a stand-up
white dude.

That made things a hell of a lot
easier right off the bat.

Once I got to prison,
it was all about doing time...

how to work the clock.

I always wonder why they got
a plant in a smut magazine.

It don't even match the upholstery,
you know what I'm saying?

Slim: That is a nice plant, though.
I got to give her that.

She's looking at him, she don't
even seem like she's enjoying him.

Where do you get those magazines?
Same place your mother does.

Don't talk about my mother.

This guy looks a little bit
like John Wayne

if you look at him
a certain way.

That kind of reminds me...
the Duke is on Tv tonight.

How many times
have you watched that show?

I don't know.
20, at least.

It seems to come on Tv
about five times a year.

I'm down about a nickel now.

Man, I thought I'd been
down a long time. Shit.

You know, the Duke
is the best, man.

He's got style.
He's all-American, is what he is.

Slim: Oh, yeah.
Don't you think so?

"All-American" what?

So you was into smack
on the street?

Oh, yeah.

Big time.

What kind of dope
they be doing in California?

Are they into that
"Mexican Tar" stuff?

No, I bet they're into
that Chinese shit, huh?

You know, the kind
that light a match

and knock you on your ass.
Is that it?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'd like to try
that stuff sometime.

I was into it all...
mostly Persian, though.

"Persian"? What the fuck is that?
Dope from l-ran.

If it comes from Iran,
why do they call it "Persian"?

'Cause Iran
used to be "Persia."

So? It ain't now,
is it?

I don't know.
I guess it just sounds cooler.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah, I heard
of that shit.

Yeah, the "A-rabs"
be having that shit.

And I think I knew
a couple of cats

down in New Orleans
who was into that shit.

They don't have that shit
over there.

Yeah, they had that shit.
You don't think I'm connected?

What the fuck...?

I was the man.
Everybody had to come to me.

You don't believe me, do you?
I believe you.

You don't believe me
now, do you?

I believe you.
I'm gonna show you.

I believe you.

Yeah?
Yeah, I believe you.

I'm gonna come up with that shit.
What do you think about that?

Yeah.
Yeah?

You don't think
I can do it, do you?

I can pull a few strings
and arrange a few things

and have a few things
coming in here.

We'll see.
You'll find out.

Like a Mississippi gambler...
I got my hand in everything.

You'll find out.
We'll see about that.

I got the mud
under my fingernails

I've been so close
to the Mississippi...

Okay, all right.
Fuck it.

We'll see. Proof is
in the pudding. Show me.

What the fuck you talking
about "pudding" for?

Shit... tapioca motherfucker.

Slim: I was starting
to get used to the joint.

I tell you, though,
it took a while

to get over the shock
of being locked up.

I remember walking
the tier one day

thinking to myself,
"How the fuck did I get here?"

But you get used to it,

once you learn
how to play the game.

And the game...
is cards.

All right,
y'all in or not?

I'm in this. Don't get
your drawers in a bunch.

He don't wear no drawers.
You know how hillbillies are.

Fuck you, who you calling hillbilly,
coon-ass motherfucker?

You, stupid.
I may be stupid,

but at least I'm happy.

Yeah? Maybe you
should write a book...

"How to be happy
but stupid."

(all laugh)

Is it true what they say
about you guys,

like y'all are inbred
and fucking your sisters?

Of course it is. Have you ever
seen a more inbred Mongoloid...

Fuck you, Eddie!

I thought you were from Kentucky.
Isn't "Mongoloid" in China?

It means he's retarded, Mario.

That explains that
stupid-ass grin on his face.

He's fucking retarded.

I don't know who the fuck
you talking about, Eddie.

Your coon-ass is
as inbred as mine is.

You probably be mixing it up with
them 'gators down in them swamps.

I've seen you in the visiting room
with that girl.

I heard she's your sister.

Come on, you can tell
"Uncle Mario" the truth.

Damn, she's your sister?
Man, that's fucked up.

You were all up on her, too.
She ain't my sister.

That kid she has is yours.

How could you go up
in your sister like that?

That bitch ain't my sister.
That's not what I heard.

I heard she's on the family visiting
list and your ass ain't married.

Everybody be knowing
the only people

that get on that
visiting list

have to be a relative
or kinfolk.

Come on, man...
she ain't my sister, okay?

If she ain't your sister, who
is she? Your homie here just said...

Coon-ass son of a bitch
ain't no homie of mine.

Can we play
the fucking game?

Hell, no... you ain't getting off
the hook that easy. Who is she?

We ain't gonna play the fucking game
till you tell us who she is.

All right, y'all really want
to know? She's my cousin. Okay?

She's your cousin?

She's my fucking cousin!
Can we play the fucking game?

Oh, yeah, we can play
the fucking game, now.

Assholes.

(all laughing)
Fuck you guys.

Yo, Mario.
Slim, what's up?

I can take care of that.
Slim: Cool.

Make it a deuce.
No problem.

Catch you guys later.

Are you going
to play cards with us?

You don't want
to play cards with me.

I'll just take
all your money.

Listen to him.
Just sit down here.

We'll show you
who's going to take who.

I'd love to help you,
but I'm on a mission.

All right.
See you guys later.

Get your money
and come back, all right?

Mario: So, Hillbilly, what's up
with you and them banks?

How many did you say
you robbed?

24.

What do you mean,
"What's up with me and them banks?"

You ain't exactly
no John Dillinger.

How did you convince anybody
to give up the money?

Anybody will give up the money
if you stick a gun in their face.

No, man, you don't need
a fucking gun. It's in the attitude.

With your skinny ass,
you're lucky

the bitch didn't laugh you out
of the bank.

No man, I just give her
the old "skunk eye."

The what?

The skunk eye. Ain't you never
heard of the skunk eye?

No, why don't you hip us
to the "skunk eye"?

What I'd do,

I'd stroll into the bank
real cool-like,

slide up to the teller,
hand the bitch a note.

What did the note say?

I'd write the same thing
on it every time.

And what's that?

"This is a bank robbery.
Don't make it a murder."

That'll work.

Then I'd go up and give her
the old skunk eye.

(all laughing)

Mario: That's pretty good.
Let me try that.

"Hey, this is a bank robbery.
Don't make it a murder."


That's pretty good, man.

And the beauty of it is,
it works every fucking time.

Mario: You a crazy-ass
peckerwood, Hillbilly.

"The old skunk eye"!

So what are you doing here?

Can't a guy visit
his old partner?

Ex-partner.
Come on, man.

I saw Gina
and she says, "Hey."

That's real nice, you're
taking care of my girlfriend.

Ex-girlfriend.

Hey...

you know I'll hook you up
when you get out, bro'.

You know I'm good for it.

Well, I don't need any help.
I can find my own women.

Not for a while, though.

I'm just kidding.

Don't go get
all bitter, Slim.

What the fuck
is this visit all about?

I don't want any visitors.

You know what it's about.

You had the money.

And all I want is my share,

and I'll set up the deals.

I'll give you your share
when you get out.

You like to hold on to my stuff,
don't you, Paulie?

You know you have it, Slim.

I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

The cops got it
when I got busted.

They didn't mention anything

about no 300 Gs in the trial.

Maybe they didn't want
to report it to the IRS.

You know these cops
are all corrupt.

Yeah, I know about that.

I know how you are, bro'.

You're like me.

I'm a con, you know?

You wouldn't do that
to your old partner, would you?

Like you wouldn't testify
against me, would you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Listen, man,
I gotta go.

Yeah, good fucking idea.
Get the fuck out of here!

It was good to see Paulie

'cause I was worried
about the money.

But he made it clear
he didn't know jack.

Thank you, shorty.

Chingas tu madre, cabrón.

(train rumbles)

(train rumbles)

(whistle whines)

It's insidious how that shit
creeps back into your life.

All the old excuses
come back.

How quick you forget all the misery
it puts you through.

You know what's
fucked up, Mario?

No, Slim,
what's fucked up?

I'm tripping on this shit.

These days,
a fucking drug dealer

gets more time
than a murderer.

I mean, what kind
of shit is that?

Tell me about it.

My uncle killed his wife...
he served two years.

You're kidding.
For murder?

Yeah.

Two years...
'cause after that

they fried his ass
in the electric chair.

(all laugh)

Yo, man,
you got any smokes?

Fuck, Mario, you've got
a whole pack there.

What the hell are you
begging me for?

That's my money.
I don't fuck with my money.

I see how it is. I'm sitting
on these generic-ass smokes

while you be sitting
fat on them humps.

You can just suck my dick.

Your ass don't be
smoking, no way.

You just be chewing
on that nasty-ass shit.

What's it matter to you
what I smoke or don't smoke?

I ain't the one begging.
I ain't begging, fool,

I just thought we were cool.
Here... I'll see you.

I must be out of my fucking mind
to ask your tightwad ass for shit.

Fuck you, Mario.

Would you two
shut the fuck up?

Here, man, let's play.

Thank you.

Hey, Eddie?

I hear you got some more of them
books you've been getting in.

No, I have the same old
tired books.

You've been holding out on me?
You sly devil.

He's holding out on us, Mario!

The son of a bitch
is holding out.

You act like you've never
seen no fuck book before,

let alone some real pussy.

Oh, yeah?
What about his sister?

Fuck it, man. I told you guys
she's not my sister.

If it wasn't for your sister
giving you some,

you'd be getting
no pussy at all.

Didn't they teach you
how to come up with the ladies?

No. See, Hillbilly's
from the boondocks.

In them hollers they ain't got
no real women.

All they got
is their relatives.

These dudes come up fucking
farm animals and shit.

The first pussy ol' Kenny ever got
was a goddamn Holstein.

Me? What about you?

Why don't you tell these guys
what you told me

about them chickens
up at your uncle's place?

You two are serious
about this shit?

You're a couple of sick
motherfuckers, you know that?

Y'all never been
on a "heifer hunt."

Nah, man.
What's that?

I believe that is where
the whole crew goes out

and they get real drunk
and then they go out

and bag the ugliest bitch
in the bar, isn't that it?

No.
A real heifer hunt.

Y'all never been on one?

No, man, what the fuck
is a "heifer hunt"?

Well, it's when you
and your buddies...

Hold up. This ain't about me.
This is about you.

We don't be doing this shit in
Chicago like you backward-ass fucks.

Eddie: Let him finish.
That's all right.

We may be all backward
and all down there,

but at least I ain't in here
for murdering some old lady.

Shut the fuck up before
I go up in your skinny ass.

That was an accident,
you motherfucker.

Just finish the story,
Hillbilly.

Okay.

What we do, is we all gather
up in my pop's Dodge

and head down
to the old McNilly place.

You got to make sure to bring along
one of them baby sledgehammers...

What's the hammer for?
Eddie: Shh.

Now you got to do this shit
around midnight.

'Cause that ol' bastard McNilly,
he be having a gauge.

Y'all ever been hit with a buckshot?
Check this out, man.

Come on.
Just tell the story.

All right, man,
it ain't no big thing.

You guys all act like
you never done this before.

So what you got to do,
is you got to go up to them pens

where they be keeping
them little calves penned up.

You know them calves...

they don't be having
no teeth.

All you got to do
is whip it out...

and goddamn, if them things
don't give the best head

in the state of Kentucky!


What's the hammer for?
God damn it, is you stupid?

That little thing thinks you're
the tit on its mama's udder.

Shit man, It be trying
to suck your thing right off.

You got to hit him pretty good
if you want to get him off.

Sometimes he just be sucking
and sucking.

You keep on hitting
and hitting it...

I can't believe
this shit.

...it doesn't
want to let go.

I heard of some sick shit
in my life,

but that takes
the fucking cake.

Don't knock it
till you try it.

I haven't tried
suicide either, but...

I'll help you out
with that.

(Spanish music playing)

What's up, man?
What's up?

We got some shit coming in.

You guys in?

Is it pure?
Yeah, just like last time.

When is it coming?
It'll be here soon.

As soon as it gets here,
I'll send it down.

All right.
All right.

Hey... you going to ask me
about my visit?

Fuck your visit. Got the shit?
Yeah, man.

You know how it is. My old lady
come through like gangbusters.

The shit, bro.'
Okay, man. Hold your horses.

I have to get it out first.

Ooh, that feels good.

You're a sick fuck, man.

K.C. Pulled a major
dope fiend move...

put the hit
on the Brotherhood shit.

I never seen a fool
make a bigger mistake.

Eddie: Dang, man,
did you eat some of that

nasty "chuck and cluck"
for dinner?


Frank: You are one
lying motherfucker.

Kenny: That is one of them
"stealth" motherfuckers...

silent but deadly.
It just creeps up on you.

Eddie:
Goddamn it, Frankie. Damn.

Fuck the both of you.
What the fuck is this?

Are you guys playing
or what?

I ain't calling you
a liar, Frank,

but that was
a garlic-smelling one.

You're the only garlic-eating
motherfucker around here.

Kiss my garlic ass,
Hillbilly.

You are one stanky
motherfucker.

"Stanky-Frankie."

What the fuck is this?
Are you guys in or out?

OI' wop-ass Frank
must have a good hand.

Who the fuck is this guy?

Who the fuck you calling
a goddamn wop, you little shit?

Come on, "dago-boy,"
you're the only

Mussolini-looking
motherfucker around here.


Mussolini
was bald, man.

No, no, I think Mussolini
was a breakfast cereal.

No, man, Mussolini
was a wop.

Wasn't he
a big fat, greasy...

Motherfucker,
give a little respect...!

You understand?
Frank!

He's just a stupid, goddamn
hillbilly. It ain't worth it.


Goddamn it, Hillbilly,
you're one dumbass motherfucker.

What are you trying
to do, kill me?

If I was trying to kill
your ass, you'd be dead.

Are you guys finished?

Yeah, we're finished.
All right. Let's play.

(rapid clicking)

Fuck, Hillbilly!
Damn it, man, stop crying.

You sound like my bitch.
Who you calling "bitch"?

Just hold still.
Hold still.

So, K.C.,

you're coming in
on a violation, huh?

I'm always back in
on a violation.

I'm starting to look at
my release dates like furloughs.

Ever since I was 14 years old,

the longest I've ever been out
is 18... 18 months.

So what did you do
on your last "furlough"?

I broke the record, man.
16 hours.

Damn, what happened?

I went over to my old lady's house
to see my kid...

she's been hanging out with this
fucking "new age" wuss motherfucker.

I pull up and he comes out
on the porch

and he says I can't
come into my house...

like he's gonna stand
in the way of my kid.

Yeah?
What did you do, homes?

What the fuck you think
I did, man?

I broke his jaw
in three places.


So did you get a chance
to see your kid?

No, man. The bitch
called "the man" on me.

They were down on me
like white on rice.

I was back in the joint
since that night.

Goddamn it, man.

You mean to tell me you didn't get
any pussy while you were out there?

Shit...

it wasn't
in the cards, man.

Besides, who needs pussy
when I got punks like you in here?

I got your "punk" right here.

You didn't even get any dope
while you were out there.

That's the sad part
about it.

Me, I'd be
out the gate at 8:00,

and in the spoon by noon.

Yeah, "Shakespeare," you'd also
be in the pen by 10:00.

(needle stops)
Fuck, man!

Sorry, man.
It's getting jammed up on me.

Slim: Well, it looks like
you're "in the car" now.

What are you
talking about, dude?

Word has it
that you're holding.

Who tells you this shit?

Anybody that would tell you
shit like that is a liar, man.

Ain't got shit.

(needle stops)
Ow! Damn it, Hillbilly!

Damn, I'm sorry, man.
We're gonna have to stop.

This thing is getting
jammed up on me.

All right,
let's put it away.

How's your lady doing?
She's doing cool.

Get your pictures
of your daughter?

Yep. Sent them.
Oh, yeah?

Them at the new pad
and shit.

That's cool, man. I'm expecting
some pictures, too.

Oh, yeah?

Got something for you.

Thanks, man.
All right.

(speaking Spanish)

Shoot this out to everybody, man.
V ato: Hell, yeah.

Gonna handle some business.
That's right, make some money.

It better be good.

I'll check it out right now.

Okay, Jamerson, get up.

What's up, Dudley?
Why you want to shake me down?

We got the word on you.

Just get up and shut up.

I can't believe this.

Well... look
what we have here.

You know the routine.

That's my partner.
How many points we got?

Let's just put it this way...
we are kicking ass.

Frank: That's a temporary setback.
Just play your cards.

Goddamn it, Frankie,
what's up?

You're supposed to be
the big fucking master and all.

I'm already in the hole
for two cartons.

Jesus Christ
on a motherfucking ladder.

All you can do is play
the hand you're dealt.

That's right.

Where is he?
Where is Eddie?

Is he scared to come by
since we beat him last time?

No, he's on the phone sweating
that dope, trying to get a visit.


No one's gonna visit
that punk.

Shit, you know
when he left the street

them bitches
were having a party.

He's says he's the man.

"The King of New Orleans."
"The Great Cajun Pimp."

Frank: Word's out that somebody
did snitch on Todd

in that "unfortunate incident."

Everybody knew
the motherfucker was holding.

All these petty-ass
punks up in here,

I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

I understand the dope
belonged to the Brotherhood.

That means somebody's
gonna get fucked up.

Yo te mato, yo te mato

Yo te mato traficando

Yo te mato, yo te mato

Yo te mato traficando

Yo te mato, yo te mato

Yo te mato traficando

Yo te mato, yo te mato

Yo te mato traficando...

What's up, man?
What's up?

You think
I'm some kind of clown?

What are you talking about?

That dope was bad, homes.

If it was bad, I'll take care of it.
Don't come off crazy.

I come as crazy
as I want, homeboy.

You want me to take care of it
or you wanna have a problem?

Take care of it.
All right.

You know my word is good.
I'm not going to fuck you over.

If it's bunk, we'll handle it.

If the dude who bought it is bunk,
I'll handle him too.

Don't worry about it.
You better handle him.

(inmates' voices yelling)

It's like you guys thought...
it ain't no good.

It's bunk.
Let's go handle it.

Hey, man, we got to do something if
these fools don't put in that work.

I know he said
he was going to do it,

but he better do something,
'cause this shit ain't right.

That shit was bunk.
I know.

Can't let them disrespect us.

But like he said, he said
he was going to check that fool.

If he don't, we're going
to find out who it was.

V ato #1: Check that fool.
Handle business, bro'.

Carnales are disappointed
about what's happening.

I know, man,
but check it out.

Got a little bit longer.
I'm short-timing anyway.

Sammytown ain't going
to be about nada.

Tú sabes, I get out
in a few months,

my tio's out of Federal,
be back in Michoacan.

That's all I got to say...
Michoacan.

You know it's pure.
Open up the whole clientele.

Hell, yeah.

Let's do this clown.

(rock music playing)

Check it out, Slim.
Word's out on K.C.

He's going down.
Stay away from that guy.

That guy's no fucking good.
Don't even go sit next to him.

It'll be nice and short.
You watch your back.

All right?
I appreciate it.

What's up with that
piece of shit, K.C.?

Fuck if I know.

Ain't you and him
road dogs?

He ain't my road dog.

That punk is going down.

If we find out you're "in the car,"
you're going down with him.

What did that dude want?

I don't know, but he was
tripping on some shit.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

I heard some weird shit went down
with that dope that Todd had.

Like what?
I don't know.

But something ain't right.

You in the car yet?

I'm in for my visit, yeah.

I thought you were supposed
to get a visit last week.

Or was it the week
before that?

You're laughing at me now,

but when I get mine, you're all
gonna be coming to me.

Huh?

I'm going to be
sitting fat just like K.C.

You think he's got the shit?

I know it. He thinks nobody knows,
but he ain't fooling me.

I know he's got that shit.

Yeah, but that dope belongs
to the Brotherhood.

You don't think
he'd be crazy enough

to fuck with their shit,
do you?

I don't know.

But he's got somebody's dope.

And he ain't
kicking down to nobody.

That's all right,

'cause I'm going to be
hooked up in a minute.

Yeah, I ain't holding
my breath.

Well, you keep on
breathing, then.

What are we going
to do about K.C.?

I don't know. If we let K.C.
Get away with it,

every "lop" will want
to get over.

We got those youngsters
that rolled in from State.

Let them earn their bones.

Sounds good to me, dawg.

(voices talking loudly)

(inmates cheering)

Slim: Everybody could feel
the tension in the place.

It was going down
and nobody was gonna stop it.

Hating breeds your disease

Gave me a number

And took away my name

Dying, dying

In the city of pain

The emptiness...
tortured nights

Sands of stone...
got no rights

Sharpened knives

Pools of blood

No way out,
forgotten son

Gave me a number

And took away my name

Dying, dying...




Slim: Sammytown went off.

Once the killing started,

he wasn't stopping at K.C.

He was going for old scores.

We were all locked down
for about a week after that.

It gave me time to think
about what had happened.

It all came crashing down
on me like a ton of bricks...

the realization that I'd been
chasing the bag my entire life.

And all it ever brought me
and everyone around me was pain.

That's when I started
thinking I was done.

Frank: The cards
are beautiful tonight.

Yeah, yeah. You're having
your streak, I'll give you that.

But the cards are bound
to come my way.

Looky here.

Man, that's fucked up,
what happened to K.C.

That motherfucker shouldn't
have gotten greedy.

What do you mean?

I don't know what went down
between him and Todd,

but word is that Todd
is coming out of the hole

on the account of that dope
came up negative.

The brothers around here
are saying K.C. Was living large.

He might have put the hit
before Todd got out of the hole.

Slim:
Shit, for all we know

K.C. Was probably the one who
snitched him off in the first place.

Might have been.

I knew that guy was stupid.
I didn't believe he was that stupid.

I don't give a fuck about that
Nazi-ass bastard. He's dead now.

All I give a shit about is that
he owed me two cartons for a tattoo.

Frank:
Get paid up front next time.

You got that right.

Well, if it ain't
the big Cajun pimp.

How's your "quest
to slumberland" going?

I'm gonna get
a visit tomorrow.

(loud laughter)

Eddie, when are you
going to give it up?

Nobody gives a shit
about your coon-ass.

You'll see.

(mocking laughter)

I have to go now, huh?

I'm telling you,
when I make my big score,

you'll all be trying
to get in the car.

You'll see.
All right, Eddie.

Good luck, Eddie.
Eddie, we believe.

Fucking Eddie.

Eddie: What's up?
Not much, man.

Just working the clock.

Check it out, Slim.

It's the Rolls Royce.

It's the Cadillac.

It's the fucking motherlode.

Damn, Eddie.

You finally came through,
didn't you?

That's right.
You thought I wouldn't?

I'm going to be
living large now.

Fuck.
That is the shit.

Come on, man, let's do some.
Let's do some.


That's all right.

What are you fucking
talking about?

I mean, I don't want
to do any.

I've been trying to come up
with that for three months.

Now you're telling me
you don't want none?

Are you fucking crazy?

I'm done with that shit, man.

Are you getting
a little soft in the head?

I see how it is.

I see how it is, yeah.

Fuck it, then.

Hey, Hillbilly, wait up.
I got something for you.

That poor ol' Eddie.
He must have had buzzard's luck.

'Cause after he and Hillbilly
fired up the smack...

the next morning,
they call him down

to the lieutenant's office
for a random piss test.

He stayed in the hole
for the rest of my time.

You getting short,
huh, Slim?

Oh, yeah.

Listen, Slim... you hit the street
and keep on running,

and don't look back because
this place ain't no good for you.

Yeah, Pops, I know.

I'm done with this
tired fucking place.

There's got to be
more happening in life

than coming back
to this shithole.

Okay, Williams,
roll it up.

Huh?
You're going home.

Yes!

Once I hit the outside world,

all I wanted to do is get as far
from my old haunts as possible.


But old ghosts
are hard to shake.

Hey.
What do you want?

I just came by to see you.

So what?

I missed you, Slim.

I've been thinking
about you.

Can I come in?

So, what have you been up to?

Just denting the couch.

Can I have a cigarette?

Thanks.


For a minute there,
I thought you were sincere.

Slim, it's...
You just came to see me, right?

Come on in, Paulie.

Long time no see.

Yeah, it has been a while.

Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it has.


I guess this is
where you take me out.

It doesn't have
to be like that, man.

Just give me the money.

Fuck you!

Just give him...
And fuck you, too!

Slim, just give me
the money, all right?

Paulie, you got no balls.

Put your toy away before
you hurt yourself, all right?

You think I'm fucking stupid?

Me, stupid, you smart, huh?

Just give him the money.
You're gonna let this go on?

Just give him the money.
Give me the money.

Fuck both of you!

You think I'm not
going to shoot you?

All right?
Just give him the money.

I'm not going
to shoot you, right?

What the fuck
are you doing, Paulie?

Who's fucking smart now?

Huh? Look at that!

Look at that!

Who's fucking smart now?
Paulie!

Who's fucking smart now?

Paulie, stop it!
You stop this right now!

Bit by fucking bit,
I'll take you out...

Just like that...!

(gun clicks)

Here's your fucking end.

Everything wasn't
exactly going to plan.

I had two bodies
in my living room,

a bullet in my shoulder,
and I was on the run.

(train horn blasts)

It was looking like
my luck was running out.

It was nine hours
to the border.

All I knew was,
I'm not going down again.

I'd rather bleed to death.

(crossing bells ringing)

(loud horn blasts)

I was driving all night...

bleeding bad.

I finally crossed the border,
looking for the nearest hotel.

I probably wouldn't
have noticed this place

if you hadn't caught my eye.

All that I've been through...

it's nice just to talk
to someone...

(bills rustling)

Even though I have to pay you
just to sit here,

and you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying.

(door closes)

Someday I'll be on
the radio

A Latin music star

Maybe I'll be like

Jose Feliciano

Everyone
will sing my song

Everyone
won't stop dancing

Maybe I'll change
my name...

Quizá cambiaré
mi nombre

El pasado
es el pasado

Eso no es
importante...

But the future
looks very good

Llama a mi jefe

I won't be in today

Got too much to do

I've got too much to do

Someday I'll be on Tv

En Telemundo

I'll have a show like

Don Francisco

Everyone
will like me

Niños will
look up to me

Maybe I'll change
my name

Quizá cambiaré
mi nombre

El pasado
es el pasado

Eso no es
importante...

But the future
looks very good

Llama a mi jefe

I won't be in today

I've got too much to do

I've got too much to do.

(music break)

(music continues)
