Excuse me, ma'am.

Excuse me?

Why are you going to the
Attorney General's office?

Because I need
help with my kids.

My son's father works
for the Post Office,

making 28 dollars an hour.

I need some help.

I have to walk to work,

I can't even afford bus fair.

Hi
there, excuse me ma'am,

where's your kids' father?

I don't know where
he lives, but...

I do know he hasn't
help me financially.

I mean not that I need it,

but,

he hasn't seen his
son in six months.

What
would like to say

to your kids' father?

While you're out there
living with your girlfriend,

our son needs your health
insurance and benefits.

I need some help,

please.

My name is David Lee.

I'm a patent attorney for
Wallace and Wallace law firm.

Although the hours are long,

it's a very rewarding career.

I'm also a single father of
a little girl named Mary.

My daughter is my
heart and soul,

and I would lay down
my life for her,

no questions asked.

Even though it's hard
getting out of bed,

how do you make
it through the day

not knowing when you
will see your child?

I am truly lost without her.

Kelly?

You up?

I am.

All right, well
get up and get dressed baby.

Breakfast is ready.

Okay mom.

My name
is Monica Sosa.

I'm a nurse assistant
in the Medical Center.

And, unfortunately I
work the night shift.

What makes my job so
hard is the walking.

and I walk at least
30 miles a week.

But, walking
through Hermann Park

gives me a peace of mind
of how things used to be.

Ricky and I used to
bring Travis here.

I would watch him play baseball,

and I would just read my books.

Oh my God,

I really do miss my family.

Ricky started changing
right before my eyes.

He started buying new clothes,

and coming home late, and later,

until he just moved out.

Susan Martinez,
she's my coworker,

said I should go to the
child support office

and they would make him pay.

Well, today's the day
I will finally do it.

Ricky is out of control, and I
have to face a harsh reality.

My husband is with
another woman,

and he's not coming home.

The forecast,

plenty of sunshine through today
with seasonal temperatures.

We should reach our normal high

of about 82 degrees
by this afternoon.

Clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

Increasing cloudiness tomorrow,

sticky and humid
with a high of 96,

with the winds out of the east

at 14 miles per hour,

it's currently 75 degrees.

Jason.

Jason, get up.

Damn it!

What the hell?

Jason, Jason wake up,
it's time to go to school.

Boy, I know you hear me.

Get up.

Jason, get your ass up now.

I'm up mom, I'm up.

Get dressed and
come get some breakfast.

I don't want no more oatmeal,
it makes my stomach hurt.

Boy, I ain't got time to
argue with you right now.

Just like your father.

Get dressed.

All you do is eat and sleep.

I gotta fight with
you to get out of bed.

I have to call in to work today,

and now my paycheck
is gonna be short.

We're about to get kicked out

and I get no help from your dad.

Wow,
what a spectacular view.

You know I've lived
in these apartments

for the last three years.

This city is my home.

This day started
like any other day.

Cold breakfast, hot shower,

then I head to work.

My life was pretty
simple back then.

However, that all
changed when I separated

from my daughter's mother.

I thought breaking up was easy.

I thought moving on
was a piece of cake.

Boy, was I wrong.

David, this is John.

I just wanted to
congratulate you

on an excellent job
on our client case.

Because of your hard work,

we reached settlement
of 12 million dollars.

David, it's attorneys
like you that we need

in our executive administration,

and we'd like to promote to
vice president of Wallace firm.

Let's talk about it
over lunch today.

John
Wallace, that's my boss,

and the CEO of Wallace
and Wallace Law Firm.

He's a good man,
and a fair boss.

Now where was I?

Oh yeah, Stephanie,
my daugher's mother.

We separated about
six months ago,

and it's a very
complicated breakup.

If you have children
with your ex-spouses,

please understand,

this will be on of
the most trying times

in your life,

and for your children.

Thanks for the food
mom, it's really good.

Sure honey, I know
it's your favorite.

I wanted to do something
special for you today.

Thanks.

So, you ready for
your game today?

Yeah, I am.

I am so excited about this team.

You should be.

It's been 25 years
since our team

went to the district
championship.

What's wrong honey?

Nothing.

Are you sure?

I really need dad
to be at my game.

Can you please make
sure he's there,

please?

Yeah, sure Kelly.

I'll reach out to your dad
and see if he can come.

But, you know he
works late sometimes.

Okay.

Well, if you're finished
with your breakfast,

let's get to school.

Okay, let me go
grab my backpack.

Okay.

Hey mom.

How are you?

I'm fine.

How are you?

I'm okay, just taking a break.

I'm heading to the
child support office.

I just can't keep doing
this anymore, mom.

Ricky's gonna have to pay,

and he's gonna have
a huge surprise

when his wages are
garnished for child support.

Monica, you
don't need his money.

Why don't you just
move back to Austin?

Mom, come on you know that
Travis is in school here.

And he's settled in Houston.

Plus, it's time I take
charge of my life,

and that's starting today.

You know, I may not
have a car right now,

but in a few weeks I'm gonna
have money for bus fare,

and that's just gonna
be such a huge help.

I just don't
like to see you struggle.

Travis is my only grandson,

and he would be better off

living here with
his grandparents,

until you establish yourself.

Mom, it's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna be okay,
Travis is gonna be okay.

Ricky just met this woman
and completely changed.

But it's gonna be fine,
it's gonna be okay.

Listen, they are so slow at
the child support office,

and I want to be
first in line so,

can I call you later?

Okay.

Be careful.

I will mom.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Come on.

Please leave
a message after the tone.

Stephanie, it's David.

Stephanie, why aren't you
picking up my phone calls?

We both made mistakes
in this relationship.

I just think it's unfair.

Can you at least let me
hear her voice, please?

Call me.

No mom, alimony is not enough.

He needs to pay
child support, too.

And he's the one
who cheated on me.

Hold on.

Kelly, let's go.

You don't want to
be late for school.

Okay, mom.

Okay mom, I'll call you later

and let you know how it goes.

Okay, bye.

Ready?

Mm-hmm.

Let's go.

Come on
Jason, hurry up,

I can't be late today.

Uh, Mom.

Coach Thomas said
I need 180 dollars

for new football equipment.

Jason, I don't have it.

I don't even have
money for groceries.

Coach Thomas is just
gonna have to understand.

But mom if I don't have it,
I get kicked off the team.

Man, we don't never
have any money.

Boy, what did I say?

I don't have it.

I got too much going on
right now, I don't have it.

Yes ma'am.

I guess I'll just get
kicked off the team.

Boy, what'd you say?

Man finish your
breakfast, we gotta go.

Jason, what are you doing?

Mom!

Stop messing around.

Let's go.

Dave, it's Taylor.

Come on in man,
the door is open.

What's going on my brother?

Have a seat man.

Can I get you anything,
water, orange juice?

Orange juice be good.

All right,
coming up my brother.

Hey thanks.

Absolutely man.

All right Taylor, you said
you wanted to talk to me.

What's on your mind?

Dave, I'm worried about you.

How you doing?

Ugh!

How am I doing?

I'm not doing very well, man.

I'm still dealing
with this breakup.

It's been six
months since you guys

went your separate ways.

That woman definitely
has it out for you.

Why can't she just move on?

You know what?

It's because she keeps
talking about counseling,

and therapy, like we're
getting married or something.

You know what I
don't like Taylor,

is when parents break up,

they put their
kids in the middle

of all of their foolishness.

Mary has two parents,

but since we went
our separate ways,

I don't get to see her.

Dave, that's crazy.

From my perspective,

I can tell that this woman
knows this is hurting you.

If you were one of
those deadbeat dads,

she'd be throwing
Mary all in your face.

Yeah, but I'm
not a deadbeat dad.

You know that, and I know that.

And you know what?

She knows that.

No one loves Mary
more than I do.

I'm my daughter's biggest fan.

I hear you, I hear you man.

It's just wrong.

I don't know how you
can go six months

without seeing your kid.

If it were me, that would
tear my apart inside.

And what about Mary, how's
she dealing with this?

I can't believe there
are women out there

that would use their kids
as leverage against you,

a good father.

But you know what, man?

I'm gonna be honest with you.

I really believe she
loves our daughter.

She's a good mother.

But I am starting to second
guess her level of integrity.

Taylor, why am I
not seeing Mary?

Why is she avoiding
my phone calls, man?

I don't get to see her.

Her grandparents
haven't seen her

Hell man, nobody from
my side of the family

gets to see Mary.

Well, you know what they say,

hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

There is no one
angrier than a woman

that's been rejected in love.

Damn man, I wasn't trying
to go through this, man.

Ugh!

Child support office been
staring me in my face.

However, I cannot
avoid the inevitable.

Dude, I have to let you go man.

Work is piling up my brother.

So see yourself out man.
Got to call into to work.

I'm not going in today.

Well, we still on for tonight?

If Houston doesn't
win this game,

they're not gonna
make the playoffs.

Man, the last thing
on my mind right now

is hangin' at
Sammy's Sports Grill,

and nursin' a couple
of beers with you.

Man, why don't you just
give me a call tonight,

and let's just see
where my head is, dude.

You know I always got your back.

Hey man, I appreciate you man.

All right

I'll talk to you man.

Okay.

All right.

It's disgusting.

It's really that bad?

I don't even
know why I drink this mess.

Mm.

This coffee is terrible.

Yeah, Rhonda made it.

Rhonda?

Yeah,
tell me about it.

I freakin' hate this place.

Well, I love it, you know why?

Why?

Because I always put
some magic in my coffee.

What, that's not
a good idea. What?

It works, yeah.

Jesus Christ.

Rhonda supplies it.

Hey y'all know I'm security
right, that's not good.

You don't even have a gun.

But I have a whistle.

I know how to blow.

Lunch
break you know,

you know we get our party on.

She loves to party.

You haven't seen her.

You all party together?

What kind of place
am I workin' at?

Jesus Christ.

Don't ask me.

I mean I love it.

See why I'm so
friendly by the end of the day?

I just thought that
you was a perky person.

Jessica Bradley, line two.

Jessica Bradley, line two.

Well guys, it's
about that time.

Please don't tell me we

Okay, now that was weird.

Fellas, don't think because you

that you deserve
a pat on the back.

News flash, there's no
homecoming for being

responsible for your children.

Daja

That's my daughter's name.

Really?

Yeah.

Ma'am, you have a
beautiful daughter.

Thank you.

Absolutely.

Ever had a person

that didn't like you
for whatever reason?

They just picked on you,

for every little thing.

Well this my friend,
is a hot mess.

Excuse me?

Yes?

How ya doin'?

I'm good.

I don't mean to be rude and
all up in your damn business,

but did I hear you
say you came here

to file child
support on yourself?

Yes, I did, and I do
think you're being rude.

But if you must ask,

I'm no longer with
my daughter's mother,

and I'm just here to take care

of my financial
responsibilities.

Do you mind?

What the hell?

Here this man come to file
child support on himself,

and me, I can't find my
kid's sorry ass father.

What, what's
going on over there?

Everything good?

I'm fine, thank you.

I got my eye on you.

Michael Johnson?

It's about damn time.

Come on back.

Does it always take this long?

This has been horrible.

I just can't believe this.

Come on
in and have a seat.

laughing

Oh great!

Surprise!

What is this,
some kind of ambush?

What the hell is
Michelle doing here?

Michael, I'm not
here to argue with you.

Here, you want my wallet?

Mister Johnson?

She legally does have
a right to be here.

Fine, fine here.

Here are my pay stubs.

Here's my ID.

You can have a quart of
blood too, if you need it.

Thank you, Mister Johnson.

God,
this is ridiculous.

God!

What are you doing here, anyway?

Really?

I'm gonna stay one
step ahead of you, buddy.

They
are trying to screw you, man.

Jessica Bradley, line two.

Jessica Bradley, line two.

That's a lot of clicking,

as long as it's under 500
bucks, I should be okay.

So, Miss Bradley?

How much is it, what's
the amount gonna be?

I mean, don't put me
in the poor house.

Please let me explain.

All right.

Here it comes.

So, because you owe
back child support,

we divide into five years,
at 280 dollars a month.

So that's in addition
to your monthly payment

of 1000 dollars per month.

What?

So, your garnished wages
is 1,280 dollars a month,

based on your
Oh my God.

current salary.

No, this is unacceptable.

I can't pay that,
I can't pay that.

I'm sorry sir,

that is the amount--
No, this is unacceptable.

Based on
your current salary.

It's unacceptable,
I can't pay this.

This is ridiculous.

1,280 bucks a month!

Are you out of your mind?

Are you out of your mind?

Are you kidding me?

Oh my God, really?

You took it all, I don't
have anything left.

How am I supposed to live?

I'm broke now.

Oh my God, really?

Oh Michael.
Fine.

Just pay it.

Don't even bother.

So, your baby mama didn't
make you come up here?

Unbelievable.

Are you a doctor?

Lawyer?

Are you gay?

'Cause I ain't ever heard of
this type of stuff before.

You know what?

You really need to back up,

'cause you all up in
my personal space.

Can a brother breathe?

Just to answer your question,

and to let you know, there's
a first time for everything.

I'm just here to
do the right thing.

Damn, I was just
asking a question.

Man, you know what?

I'm not about to
sit here and let you

make my blood pressure come up.

Man, whatever.

Gay ass.

This sister's trippin' man.

What the hell is going
on up in here, man?

Damn it, Michelle.

She's
your daughter, too.

You
just took it all.

You had to take everything!

I have nothing!

Nothing!

All my damn money,
1200 bucks a month.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

What do you want?

How much did you say?

1200 bucks, they're gonna
take all my damn money.

Yeah I'd be mad too,

but you gotta take
that outside, brother.

Take it out, take it out.

You're next bro.

Don't let them screw you
out of all your money.

I'm gonna be eatin'
frickin' jelly sandwiches

for the rest of my life.

God!

I'll be back.

David Lee?

Thank God.

What a hot mess.

I gotta get the
hell out of here.

Please have a seat.

Thank you.

You know,

I have been here
for eight years,

and you are the first
man who has volunteered

with no court order.

Most men have to be pushed
and dragged to come here.

You know, you are rare,

and I heard you stirred
up my lobby quite a bit.

In all honesty,
your lobby is a zoo.

Thank you for saving me.

Now look, if I may say this,

this place is like a torture
chamber for the average man.

You can take away his food,

he could lose his girlfriend,

break his new sports car.

However, my mother always says,

a man's finances is his
most prized possession.

So many cases just go to court,

because fathers don't feel

they need to be financially
responsible for their children,

regardless of the relationship
status with the mother.

So, it is a really
good thing to know,

that there's still
good fathers out there.

Ma'am, please allow me to say,

I believe money is important
to everyone, not just mothers,

but fathers as well.

I mean, we have bills,
we have to live too.

But jail, that's not
an option for me.

Okay, my parents taught me

to be responsible
for my daughter.

That's why I'm here.

You know, I
completely understand.

Let's just start all over.

My name is Jessica Bradley.

I'm the Senior Child
Support Officer.

How may I help you?

Miss Bradley, let
me be honest with you.

I have not seen or heard
from my daughter in months.

Her mother will not
pick up my phone calls.

I'm desperate, and
I'm out of options.

That's why I'm here
in your office.

I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

Money doesn't matter to me.

I broke up with my
daughter's mother.

I never intended to break
up with my daughter.

And I'm hoping when my
daughter becomes an adult,

that she will
learn to appreciate

how hard I fought to
keep her in my life.

After all, she is my priority.

So, here is my application,

and here's my identification.

Tameka Williams?

Boy, what do you
think you're doing?

You know, you know better.

Take it to your room.

Man.

Hello my dear,
how's my little man?

He's doing his homework.

Well, did you go?

Yes ma'am, I did.

I can't stand the
child support office,

they are so damn slow.

Well, I'm
just glad you went.

Now you can finally
catch up on your bills.

Yeah, but I'm not counting
on James to come through.

Okay, well
you did the right thing,

by filing child
support on his ass.

Mom, you won't believe
what happened in there today.

There's a man that walked
into the child support office,

and guess why?

Court's order?

No, he came in there to
file child support on himself.

What?

I can't believe that.

I was so mean to him.

All I could think about
was Jason and James.

I cursed him out bad.

Tameka, don't hate
every man because of James.

This man should be
praised for understanding

that mothers need their help
to raise their children.

I guess you're right.

Let me go start dinner.

Jason be way to quiet
in his room right now,

and he's gettin' so big.

I'll talk to you later.

Yeah, yeah, walk along lady.

Yeah, listen to your
headphones lady.

Yeah, happy day isn't it?

Happy day.

$900 dollars,
that's unbelievable.

Let's go.

Come on, let's go.

It's a green light
lady, come on.

Come on.

Where is she?

Come on, come on man.

Come on, you're not
supposed to yield right now.

Hurry up.

I can't believe this.

My AC doesn't even work,

but yet she wants
900 dollars from me?

Come on, pick up the phone.

Pick up your phone!

Yeah come on, she has
to be here somewhere.

She has to be here somewhere.

Yeah, enjoy the art show lady.

Yeah, probably on
your husband's dime.

That's why she's jealous,

she's jealous because
Veronica is independent,

and she's not, she
never has been.

How am I?

I have to pay to see my son?

I have to pay to see my son?

Oh, I wish it were that easy.

I wish I could just
sign on the dotted line

and see my son.

Unbelievable.

It's too easy.

Where is she?

There she is.

Monica!

Monica!

Monica!

Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

Answer your phone Monica.

Monica?

Monica?

Monica, I know you
hear me, Monica.

God damn it, Monica!

Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

Answer your phone, Monica.

Monica, I see you, Monica.

Monica!

Hey, I know you hear me.

What?

What the hell is going on?

What do you want?

I go to my office, my
boss hands me this letter.

What did you do?

Huh?

I filed child support on you.

Of course you filed
child support on me.

You know what?

That's exactly why I left you.

Ricky, I'm not about to
have this argument with you.

I walk to work every day,

and you never once
offered to give me a ride.

Not once.

You getting to work
is none of my concern.

I don't care how you get there.

Really? Uh huh.

And is Travis none
of your concern?

'Cause when he gets sick,

now I have to take
him to the clinic,

'cause you took him
off your insurance.

It's wrong, and you know it.

You know Brian, Brian was
right what he said about you.

Look at you, you're
just a gold digger.

Oh yeah, okay, a gold digger.

Really?

You know what?

Veronica's got your
mind so twisted,

you don't even know
up from down anymore.

Oh my God, that woman
has three children.

Three, and they get the
benefit of your entire salary,

while Travis struggles?

I won't have it.

There she goes
about Veronica again.

Well her three kids are
none of your concern.

But 20% of my damn paycheck.

That's almost 900
dollars a month.

And don't forget back child
support for nine months.

You know I think I
just figured it out.

You're jealous, that's what
this whole thing stems from.

Yep, I'm jealous.

You know what?

Miss Veronica can have you.

Sooner or later, she's gonna
figure out who you really are.

You have no idea what
you're talking about.

Whatever Ricky, you heard me.

I mean I am tired of
you and your lies.

I'm moving on, and I'm
gonna be strong for Travis.

So you can go
ahead with Veronica

and this new family
of yours or whatever,

but I'm gonna raise
Travis to be a strong man,

who's responsible for his kids,

unlike his sorry-ass father.

Hey, god damn it.

Get off of me.

You all see that?

You know what, he's my son too.

And I'm not paying it.

I'm not paying it.

Anybody see that, she hit me.

How's my little man?

I'm just finishing
my math homework.

Jason,

I wanted to apologize about
my attitude this morning.

I just want you to have all
the things

that I didn't have as a kid.

Mom, I know dad's not
helping you with money.

That's why we eat
so much oatmeal.

But I still love you.

And I still love dad.

Okay Jason.

Finish up your homework

and I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

Okay mom.

Look at this.

I have no food in the house.

We have nothing to eat.

I can't keep doing this.

I can't keep doing this.

I can't keep doing this!

I hate you, James!

I hate you!

Mom!

Mom!

It'll be okay.

Don't cry, don't cry, okay.

It'll be okay.

It's going to be okay.

I never thought

I could hate my son's father.

I can still hear
Ricky screaming.

My God, why is he so angry?

I stink.

I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower,

then do my homework in my room.

I thought I smelled a
little something in the car.

It's just a little bit worse

than when your dad goes fishing.

Wow, really mom?

I'm just kidding.

You played really hard today.

Why don't you go on up?

I'll come up and check
on you in a little bit.

Okay.

Oh Micheal,

look what you're
doing to our daughter.

You should be
ashamed of yourself.

Let me call mom.

Hey, what's going on John?

David, I
didn't see you today.

Is everything okay?

I'm okay sir.

I just had some
personal business

I needed to attend to today.

It's not like
you to just disappear.

Is your daughter okay?

My daughter is fine.

I'll tell you what, John.

First thing in the morning
I will come to your office,

and we can talk about it.

Sure thing Dave.

Okay, have a good evening, sir.

No mom, I'm outside.

She's upstairs
doing her homework.

She can't hear me.

You shouldn't
treat her father like that.

Mom, why are you
taking up for him?

I'm not
taking up for him.

Michelle, why are you trying
to make him to be a bad father?

He's not.

I'm so sick of you and Michael.

You need to go upstairs and
tell my granddaughter the truth.

Kelly thinks her
father is coming home.

Stop procrastinating,
stop blaming Michael,

and go talk to your daughter.

Now, I love you, and I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

Okay mom, I love you too.

Bye.

Michael,
of all people, why Karen?

What do
you mean, why Karen?

Really?

You left me.

I can't do this anymore.

Oh great, all
you do is nag nag nag anyway.

Every time you open your mouth.

What the hell is
wrong with you, woman?

You
need to move out of the house.

I'm out of here.

Michael, I'm done.

I want a divorce.

Good,
that's fine with me.

I don't need you.

I've been waiting for
that, that's just fine.

You're gonna regret this.

I'll talk to my lawyer tomorrow.

I'm glad you asked for it first.

I'm gonna get everything.

You watch, I'm out of here.

I don't need you.

Oh
my God, what a long day.

I'm just glad to be home.

You ever had a day

that you were so excited about,

then at the end of that day,

everything that could go wrong,

did go wrong.

What happened?

Why do I feel so empty inside?

Am I really all alone?

Oh boy, I really need a drink.

You know, I thought by filing
child support on myself

was the right thing to do.

After all, I'm no longer
with my daughter's mother.

I would have never
thought in a million years

a father would be
criticized, and laughed at,

for being financially
responsible for his child.

What really is the message my
parents taught me as a kid?

Ladies and gentlemen,
when your relationship

with your spouse is over,

in order to move on,

one must not
procrastinate the end.

You cannot move
on with your life,

until you've legalized
your separation.

She
took my money, my money.

She took it all.

She took all of it.

Damn it!

I should have known.

I should have known!

God she's been,

She's been planning this.

How could I be so stupid?

God, she took my money.

I don't know,
something's gonna happen.

Something's gonna happen.

She failed me every time.

What comes around, goes around.

I'm gonna get mine, too.

I'm gonna get mine.

I don't!

You're not gonna get
away with this, ever.

â™ª I want it all

â™ª Yeah, I want everything

â™ª You know it ain't worth living
if you're dreaming small. â™ª

â™ª I want it all

â™ª I want it all

Took my money,

took my huntin' trips,

and you took my
damn season tickets.

I work 60 hours a frickin' week.

This is my money.

â™ª I want it all

My money!

Damn you, Michelle.

God!

Hello sir, welcome to
Sammy's Sports Grill.

What?
How many?

How many, you can't
see it's just me?

Really?

What do they pay you?

It's too much.
Excuse me.

Who hired
that woman anyway?

I can't believe she has a job.

Ignorance running rampant.

Hi sir, what can I get you?

Case in point, who are you?

Don't you have a curfew?

Sir, you don't have
to talk to me like this.

Whatever, go find your
parents, they're lookin for ya

Go text on your cell phone.

Go find a toilet to clean.

What's your problem, man?

You, move along little girl.

Watchin' the game here.

Yeah yeah yeah, I heard you.

God, Mike.

What?

Chill out.

She is new.

Okay, I'm working
on it, I had a...

You would not believe
the day I had today.

Okay, so how's it going?

How's it going?

It's going horrible,
that's how it's going.

The worst frickin'
day of my life.

God.

You have no idea.

Mike, calm down.

Okay?

What happened?

My wife, Michelle,
that's what happened.

This woman.

She took it to a
whole new level today.

You know, when I
told her I was sorry,

I said those words, they
came out of my mouth.

I'm sorry, but did
she remember that?

No!

Oh no.

We were separated, okay,

before I even
started seeing Karen.

It was over.

It was over, I wouldn't
cheat on my wife.

I wouldn't cheat on my wife.

I wouldn't do that.

God!

Kelly?

Hey mom.

Hey baby, oh you're
smelling good now.

Yeah, I really needed it.

Do you have a minute?

Yeah.

So,

I wanted to talk to you

about what's going on
with me and your dad.

Yeah, I know.

He hasn't been answering
any of my calls.

What's going on?

You know your father's
going through a lot right now,

but I think he's gonna be okay.

Let's just give him a
little more time to adjust.

More time?

Mom, is dad mad at me?

Is that why he
hasn't been answering

any of my text messages
or calling me back?

No baby, your father
is not upset with you.

Okay?

Maybe a little bit with me,

especially after today.

But, you know I'm
starting to just think

that your father's
upset with himself.

Mom, I don't understand.

Mom, please don't tell
me you're leaving daddy.

Kelly please, let me explain.

Mom, are you and
dad getting a divorce?

Kelly, please,

try to understand

what I'm gonna
explain to you, okay?

Your father, he loves
you very, very much,

and he's always been
a good dad to you.

But your father will no
longer be living with us.

Mom, no please.

We all make mistakes, that's
what you tell me all the time,

is to forgive my
friends at school.

I know, I know Kelly.

And I know this is gonna
be really hard for you.

But, your father and I
are getting a divorce.

No, Mom please, whatever
dad did, I know he can fix it.

Come here.

I'm sorry.

Mom, please,

please mom, don't give up.

I know we can fix this together.

It's gonna be okay.

Okay?

We're all gonna be okay.

Sorry.

My daughter's room.

I really try to avoid
this part of the house

as much as possible.

However, I cannot
resist the temptation

of coming in here.

Every time I step
into Mary's room,

time stands still for me.

One time, I was in here for
two days without eating.

Why is Stephanie
doing this to me?

I even thought about
getting back together.

Then I realized, Mary
will grow up one day,

and life is hard enough.

People, never be in a
relationship for your kids.

Love is truly an
unconditional choice.

The relationship will not work,

and you're just
avoiding the inevitable.

Here, here it comes,
lets wave at him.

Let's wave at him Mary.

Look at them.

Okay Mary, come here Mary

You're asleep.

Come on baby.

Come on, I know you're
tired, it's late.

Come on, daddy got you.

Come here baby, daddy got you.

Come here, oh my baby
girl is gettin' big.

Come here, daddy got you.

Daddy got you.

Whoa, whoa.

You'd better hold on.

You'd better hold on.

Cause see, I can do
it with one hand.

See, I got do it with one hand.

I'm so late.

Is he gone?

I think so.

Crazy ass.

How am I
supposed to live?

900 bucks a month.

That's more than my rent.

That is more than my rent,

how am I supposed
to afford a house?

How am I supposed to
afford a house for Travis?

This is supposed to be in the
best interest of the child.

How is this in
his best interest?

I can't even save.

I can't even save
for a house payment.

I can't even save
for a down payment,

and now she wants 900 dollars?

Oh my God,

that woman has three children.

Three, and they get the
benefit of your entire salary,

while Travis struggles?

I won't have it.

What's up
baby, need a ride?

You know
what, he's my son too.

I'm not paying it,
I'm not paying it.

Did anybody see that?

She hit me.

You're always callin' me.

Always calls me
when she needs me.

When I need her now.

When I need her now,
she's nowhere to be found.

Hey, how's it goin'?

How's it goin'?

Not so good right now.

Rough day at the office?

Dude, my life sucks
right now, okay?

It sucks.

Any more questions?

Geez, no, it's all fine.

You sure?

What's his problem?

What?

You say something?

No, nothin', don't
worry about it.

It's all good.

Sure?

I'll
be right with you.

Thanks.

Watchin' the game here.

Yeah, I heard
you the first time.

Ah, take it
to the laundry mat.

I'm gonna hit that guy.

Hey girl.

Hey!

How are you?

I'm good, good, how are you?

You look great,
come on, sit sit.

What's wrong with him?

Don't look over
there girl, he's crazy.

This fool done came up
in here raisin' hell.

Wow.

His wife
done left him.

She took the house,
the kids, and the dog.

Your friend's been
waiting for you.

What can I get you?

Anything you want.

Just water, please.

Water, okay.
Me too.

Sure, I'll be right back.

Oh my gosh.

Let's take a picture.

Awesome.

Oh look, it looks so good.

Look at us being happy.

I think I'm gonna throw up.

What's going on?

Girl, nothing much,
this place is a zoo.

Oh my God.

Don't look over there girl.

He crazy, I'm telling you.

Mike?

Mike.

You're a good father, she
can't take that away from you.

I wouldn't doubt it.

That needs to be
your only focus now.

And I'm sorry to say,

but I believe your
marriage is over.

So you just need
to snap out of it.

I know you're right,

and my focus does need
to be my daughter.

In fact, I blew it today.

I was supposed to
be at her game,

I told her I would be
there, I didn't show up.

I'm just so distracted
by all of this,

with the, with that
woman, she's just.

God.

I owe my daughter an apology.

I was supposed to be
there and I didn't go.

Wait a minute.

I can't believe I missed this.

What the?

What, what's up?

My wife, Michelle.

What the hell was she doin'
at the child support office

before it even opened?

Well, it sounds like she had
this planned a long time ago.

Yeah, yeah it does.

God, I can't believe
I missed that.

Yeah, she's gonna back-charge
me child support, too.

Do you believe that?

We agreed that I would leave
the house, we agreed on that.

1280 dollars a month,

for five frickin' years.

No more boat, no more tickets.

Oh God.

I'm gonna blow a gasket,
I'm just gonna chill out,

and think about how
my life is gonna suck

for the next five
frickin' years.

That is a lot of money.

What can I get you?

How about a bandaid
for my wallet?

And a suppository, I'm
gonna need one of those.

Seriously, what can I get you?

Just, just give me my usual,
the Parmesan garlic wings,

and you know what?

Give me a soda.

Soda?

No beer?

No.

No beer, in fact, no more beer.

My focus is gonna be on Kelly.

I'm gonna stay sober for her.

There's gonna be
some change comin',

and it starts tonight.

Calm Mike.

Calm
Mike, I like that.

Sounds like a new beginning.

What's up, Taylor?

Dude, where are you?

Everybody's here at the bar
tonight, watching the game.

This place is gonna be packed.

Man, I'm not
feelin' it tonight.

After talkin' to
you this morning,

man I had to take care of
some personal business.

What, come on man.

We've been waitin' for
Houston to get on the map

for like 10 years now.

What happened?

You turned off your phone

and everything went
straight to voicemail.

What's up with the
thousand questions, man?

I'm good, I'm just gonna stay
home and chill for the night.

So, I'm not comin'
to the bar, man.

Dude, you're killin' me.

What happened?

Did you go to the child
support office today?

Yes, I did go to
the child support office.

You know what, man?

I'm good.

Dude, are you sure?

Yes I'm sure.

Stacy's here man,
I gotta let you go.

All right well, I'll
talk to you later, man.

Good luck.

I'll holler at you.

Hey baby.

Hey, what's goin' on?

I thought you were gonna watch

the game with Taylor tonight.

Yeah, I was, but I just
decided to stay home and chill.

Besides, it's a beautiful night.

Yes, it is.

What's goin' on with you?

Oh my God, I'm so excited.

So, we got the funding to
build a new youth center,

and guess who's in charge
of the entire project.

Baby tell me it's you.

Yes.

Congratulations.

Thank you, baby.

But that's enough about me.

How was it today?

Not very good.

Taylor was here earlier
today, and we were talking.

In my opinion, the
Attorney General's office,

it's a goddamn zoo.

The more I think about it baby,

I don't think I should
have gone there.

I really think I made a mistake.

What are you talking about?

David, what you did
today, was noble and rare.

This is why I was
so attracted to you.

Remember our first date?

You know I won't
let you forget it.

Yes.

And what you talked
about the entire time?

It was a little something like,

Mary, Mary,

oh and some more Mary.

Come on baby, this is
silly, and it's chilly.

David, don't beat yourself
to death about this.

Look, I'm not a mother yet,

but I know that you're

one of the bravest
men I've ever known.

What woman in her right mind

would not want you to be
the father of her child?

Stephanie's hurting
because of the breakup,

but she knows that
you love Mary,

and she knows that
you are a good father.

Baby I don't think so.

I just got my ass
chewed out today

by a bunch of angry
single mothers.

Why?

Is it because I wear a
goddamn tailored suit?

Is it because I'm not
thugged out from the hood?

I had a woman today that
called me a gay ass.

A gay ass!

In the child support office.

Baby, I'm just trying to get
legal rights to see Mary.

I'm just trying to get
some type of justice.

I'm a goddamn attorney,
I can't even help myself.

What the hell is goin' on?

David, baby, look
I know you're upset,

and I know you miss Mary.

I miss Mary too, and
I never even met her.

But you still have to believe

that what you did
today was right,

and all you want is equal
justice as a father.

Like you said, that
place is a zoo.

It's not made for
real men like you.

It's made for deadbeat dads

that look at their
children like some type

of financial responsibility
they want to run away from.

That's not you.

David, you are a good man.

And you want to know
why that's the truth?

Why is that?

Because I'm always right.

Yes, yes, you're always right.

Baby, people
break up every day,

but children still need to
be fed and taken care of.

You know this, and I thank God

that your parents raised you

to be such a responsible man.

Baby, I know you're right.

It's just that,

I'm dealing with a pain,

that I cannot describe.

I spend so much time
in her room now.

Baby, I'm missing
holidays, birthdays.

I know baby.

Even school programs.

Still, I thank God for you.

I don't know what I
would do without you.

Girl, where you
been all my life?

Gettin' ready for you.

Is that right?

You better believe it.

Now, I've got one job for you.

What's happenin'?

Sit down.

Hold on baby.
Uh uh uh uh.

No, I didn't say ask
questions, I said, sit down.

I want you to put the game on.

I can do that.

And now, I'm gonna
go make dinner.

No no no no, baby.

You don't have to do that.

I was just gonna
order us a pizza.

No no no no no, baby.

My man is not havin'
pizza tonight.

Okay.

That's right, I'm
making your favorite.

Okay mamacita, you go
on with your bad self.

You better
believe I will.

I'm gonna tell my mom.

Oh, and can you also tell her

that I want the recipe for
her red beans and rice please,

for the third time.

Yes ma'am.

Thank you big daddy.

Excuse me?

Hi, weren't you at the child
support office this morning?

Yeah, I was there
tryin' to get some help.

Look, it's pretty dark.

Can I give you a ride somewhere?

No, thank you.

Where are you headed?

Just two miles that way.

It's really okay, I walk
this every day I work.

Look, I'm just here to help
as many mothers as possible.

It's my job, and I really
do care about the children.

Are you sure?

Thank you.

So you think Houston's
gonna do it tonight?

I hope so man,

we've been waiting for
this for a long time.

Yeah we have.

I couldn't help but
hear your friend

isn't gonna make it tonight.

No, he's got a lot
goin' on, he's busy.

I'm Mike.

Go ahead and shake it.

I'm not gonna bite
your head off, again.

Taylor, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

Hey, what can I get you?

Can I get a draft beer please?

You got it.

I also owe you an apology.

I kind of took your
head off earlier,

and I really didn't
have a right to do that.

I'm having some struggles
with my wife lately.

I took it out on
you, and I apologize.

Man, it's all good.

We all go through stuff.

Thanks.

Well,

here's to Dave.

Good luck to him.

And congratulations.

So, this weather
we're having in Houston

sure is crazy, right?

I mean, one day it's hot,
the next day it's cold.

Oh, and then we get hit
by Hurricane Harvey.

And then it snowed.

I mean when was the last
time it snowed in Houston?

I'm Jessica Bradly, by the way.

I'm Senior Child Support Officer
at our downtown location.

Monica, that's my name.

So Monica, how many
kids do you have?

Just one.

My son, Travis.

Ah, he's a
good-lookin' young man.

So Monica, where do you work?

In the Medical Center.

I'm a nurse assistant,

currently on the night shift,

trying to get on the day.

And the hours are long and
the pay's really crappy.

Ugh.

Hey Monica, do you have

any clerical experience
by any chance?

Yeah, I can type
like 90 words a minute.

Wow, that's pretty great,

because we actually do need

a child support
officer in my office.

You should go online and apply.

But I don't have
any experience.

Don't worry about all that.

We'll help you pay
for the training,

and we'll help you
get your license too.

So when's your next day off?

Thursday.

All right, tell you what.

Why don't you spin by my
office, say around four?

We can talk all about it then.

Yeah okay, I'll be there.

Well great.

Hello?

Who is this?

Hello?

Is anyone there?

I can't hear you.

Hello?

Hello?

Hi daddy,
how was your day?

Mary!

Stacy, it's Mary.

It's Mary.

Oh my God, it's Mary.

My baby girl, oh God,
it's my baby girl.

My baby girl.

Oh God, it's Mary.

Mommy,

daddy's crying.

What if
I told you there's a man

in the Attorney General's
office right now,

filing child support on
himself, without a court order?

That's a first.

Good for his kids.

But I'm sorry, I'm
late, I've gotta go.

Hi there, ma'am.

Excuse me, you
look pretty happy.

What happened in there?

Well, they finally
found his cheating ass.

I just got 1280 a month.

Michael, it's over between us.

I just need you to
take care of Kelly now.

Bye.

Excuse me, sir?
Excuse me.

What?

Are you just coming

from the Attorney
General's office?

Because you look really mad.

Bro, I'm about
ready to blow up.

They got me for
1280 bucks, a month!

No more hunting, no
more season tickets.

I'm gonna get six
frickin' jobs to eat.

I'm pissed!

Get out of my face.

What the hell
are you doin' home?

You dropping that damn top,
like five times.

But I'm five percent?

Excuse me?

Yes?

How you doin'?

What's up?

That's good.

Movie magic.

We got the sound man under
the coffee table.

That's the only way
we're gonna be able

to get a perfect
picture without a glare.

Shiny balls, will
never be out of style.

Summer, Winter, Fall.

Any season really. Shiny
balls.

Go ahead
and it into position.

Shiny balls all the time.

Sorry.

Okay, you shall go straight,

and you shall turn
left at the light.

All right, all right captain.

800 dollars a month.

800 dollars a month.
