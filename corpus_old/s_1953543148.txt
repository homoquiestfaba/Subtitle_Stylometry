?

Hurry, Yoli.

(loud music)

<i>Mari, I'm hungry.</i>

<i>Ok, I'm coming, but you're</i>
<i>missing out on my moves.</i>

Whoa, shit!

(School bell rings)

Why'd you leave, girl?

It got good.

I stayed for a little bit.

It was tight, huh?

It was sick!

So then let's go again today?

Again...It's Tuesday.

Everyday's a Friday for her.

Everyday is like beans
without salt for her, ok?

You know what? That's not cool.

Is that my lipgloss?

It'd better not be my lipgloss.

Mom gave it to me...
Mom gave it to me.

How many times do I have
to tell you! It's mine!

Stop lying, it's mine!

I don't want you
going through my stuff.

I can sweep, mop,
and break down boxes.

Young lady, I don't need
help right now.

I'm only asking for
twenty a day.

Twenty for me goes a long way.
You don't believe me?

<i>Good day, Don Pedro!</i>

Dona Herlinda!

<i>What's new?</i>

(Don Pedro) You want produce?

Or gossip?

(Dona Herlinda) Both.

He's looking.

<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

What is your friend's name?

Yolanda, what is
your friend's name?

She's not my friend, Don Pedro.

Damn it.

Olivia!

Olivia!

(Students chattering)

I was just talking about
alternate angles.

Interior, exterior. Ok?
They're all congruent.

Mr. G!

I'll be right with you.

We're going to go over it.

Mr. G!

It looks great, Yolanda.

Let's keep looking
at these over here.

You do understand this, right?

Yes?
Yes.

Yes?

Ok, Mari Rodriguez...
You're gonna have to share

until I get a copy
of the textbook.

Yolanda, can you share
your textbook with her

and help her catch up?

And you're going to have
to turn that over.

It's off.

<i>(Students Ooh and Ahh)</i>

Ok, ok, relax.

Just make it disappear, ok?

What?

Nothing, you're my neighbor
is all.

And?

Do I owe you something?

I'm just saying.

You look like a little fly.

Pinche mosquita.

<i>I'm working on getting</i>
<i>your homework posted online.</i>

Tomorrow, I do not want to hear,
"What was the homework, Mr. G?"

<i>I love the excitement.</i>

Wait, Cuata. I'm putting it
on my left eye.

That means you got to
put it on your right.

So did you guys
check out the new girl?

What's up with
that freakin' attitude?

Trying to act all tough and shit
in front of everyone.

Please. I think she's trouble.

You don't even know her, Vicky.

Just saying. It must suck being
new at a big ass school.

People can be rude and stuff.

Here you go again with that
holy santita bullshit.

It's getting real old.
I left that back in junior high.

I'm just saying.

Well, get over it.
That's what I'm saying.

Don't trip off her girl.
She's just feeling off and shit.

Yeah, I guess.

(School bell rings)

She's just bitchy right now

cuz she started her period
and I didn't.

(School bell rings)

What's up with Mr. G?

Why does he always
give us a lot of homework?

I don't know, man.
I don't know what's up.

This is geometry.
He has to calm down.

Shit, you're smoking
a joint, Yoli?

Right, Cuata?

Dude, it smells like weed.

Maybe that's how
her number two smells.

You're so stupid!

<i>Hey!</i>

What the hell?

You think you're
some kind of hot shit?

I am hot shit, dumbass.

Crazy bitch!

<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

Alright, who's got it?

Hey, don't look at me.

We don't know either.

Let's just see
what the office knows.

Mari.

Thank you.

Thanks for pushing me
out in time.

My parents would have
freaked out

over something like this.

So what'd the Dean say?

I flushed that roach
down the toilet

so all they could do is warn me;
next time I'm out.

Yeah. They said I could
make it easier on myself

if I just drop out
and get my GED.

They're stupid.

It's not that crazy.

But what about college?

It's a waste of time.

It's not a waste of time.

It is for me.

Look, after school
we can meet up.

We'll go through
my Geometry book

and go over
whatever other stuff.

History, English...

Weekdays are good.
Weekends too.

One of that.

Thank you.

I don't know about studying
on the weekends.

You know, if you do good,
it's like the biggest...

Even if you don't go to college,
just imagine having the chance

to shove those grades
in their faces.

They'd feel so stupid.

I have all the homework.
We can start today.

You know you don't
owe me shit, right?

I know.

Mama!

Can I go to my friend's house?

She lives across the street.

Please? We have classes together
and we're going to study.

Ok, but don't be too late.

(Music plays from the TV)

(TV turns off)

After homework.

Please Mari?

Nope!

We should play some Ska
while doing our homework.

You won't be able to focus.

Yeah, but it'll make it fun.

Hello, my daughter.

Hello.

We're offering cereal
to our guests?

Well, it's not like
we have steak to offer.

Here, steak doesn't last.

You'll have to come real
early before it's all gone.

Can I talk to you
for a second, Mari?

While I was working all day,

you couldn't find it in you
to unpack a few boxes.

I'm tired.

What's that?

What's what?

That smell. Are you smoking?

No. Damn!

You ok?

I found it in my mom's drawer.

You look nice, Mari.

Yeah?

Yeah.

<i>Mari! Mom wants you</i>
<i>to move some boxes.</i>

Mom's calling you.

How did it go
at the neighbor's house?

I asked, how was your time
at the neighbor's?

Fine.

Let's break up into groups.
You three, Chapter 10.

You three in the middle,
Chapter 11.

Chapter 10 on the outside.

You three also Chapter 11
and Chapter 10.

Oops.

Douche!

Skank!

She's calling you.

Hop on already!

Hold on.

But not too tight.
Just like that.

Alright.

No, no, no, no, no!
Wait! My turn, my turn!

You better not drop me!
I'm not! I'm not!

Promise.
I promise.

I hope you end up
liking Huntington Park.

Why wouldn't I?

Cuz sometimes the air
smells like pan dulche

and others say
it smells like chemicals.

Or like the Las Cuatas say,
"It smells like ass."

Holy...

Are you okay?

What did I say!

Alright, that's enough.

Oh, shit. It's open.

We should go, Mari.

Come on, Mosquita.

"I love Chuy."

"Hydo Y Rusbi por vida."

"Guera Y Chaparra
friends forever."

"Mosquita y Mari."

Fuck the rest.

Whenever anybody
gets on our nerves,

this'll be our
"kick it" spot.

This is private property, Mari.

We can't just make it our own.

It's not like anybody's gonna
come here anytime soon.

"Smurf is my man.
All bitches stay away."

Yeah, you fight for your
little blue man, dumbass.

I bet you that guy Smurf
got his name

from wearing his
ugly-ass shorts.

What?

Nothing.

Smurfette.

Oh, hell, no!

Gotcha.

Look, you can do the recording

and me and Vera
can do the rest. Ok?

We're going to be doing
a random survey. Right, Cuata?

Yeah, random survey.

But what kinda survey?

Just press this button
to record, ok?

questioning your long-term
friends about shit?

So here we are
at my high school.

And we're gonna be
doing a random survey

where we're get
to ask guys

if they've ever
popped a boner in school.

Ay, Cuata.

What? It's just a question!

Anyways, we get to talk
to some cute-ass guys.

Or what? You don't
want to talk to them?

I never said that.

Well, then record me.

Hey! Have you guys ever
popped a boner in school?

No.

Whatever. Liars!

I don't know.
Maybe once or twice?

I don't know.

And how did you hide it?

Come on. Can you stop
asking me that?

Hey, have you ever
popped a boner in school?

Yeah, when I saw your mom.

Your mom, bitch.

I'll probably just block it
with these books. Like this.

Wouldn't it hurt?

Uh, I don't think so.

What about, like
if you need to stand up,

like, the teacher tells you to
write something on the board?

I'll carry my books like this.

Oh, my god, I know him!

Go ask him, Yoli!

I'm not gonna ask him!
Go ask him!

Dude, stop acting
like that again.

Hey, she has something
she wants to tell you.

Well...

What?

Have you ever
popped a boner at school?

Yeah.

How about right now?

Vicky, just turn it off already!
It's getting boring.

I was going to anyway. Damn!

I'm sorry. That was stupid.

When two angles
and a side of a triangle

are congruent to two angles
and a side of a second triangle,

what does that prove?

I didn't get that far
in the book.

Just remember "ass,"
like in culo,

but spelled A-A-S.

It stands for Angle-Angle-Side.

Easy, huh?

The culo theorem. Got it.

Look, stupid.

Those sissies
suppose to inspire us?

It's better than,

"Smurf is my man,
all bitches stay away."

I'll go with
the little blue man.

It's not that bad.

Olivia, do you want
something to eat?

Yes!

There's a pot in here.

Should I take it out?

Know what they called her?

Guadalupe la frutera.

Don't move
or you will end up

like your father
on our wedding day.

You used to cut Dad's hair?

But he wasn't the first.

I grabbed the scissors
when I was 10.

And later, I got my
cosmetology certificate

to help people look
even more beautiful.

And?

And things change.

But why did they change?

Because that's how it is.

I'll do it.

The grading scale
is on the board.

Mari...

Forget this shit.

It just means we have
to work a little harder.

I'll meet you at the shop
so don't even trip.

We can't meet up?

I have some stuff to take care
of for my mom, you know.

Maybe later.

Yeah, ok.

Hey.
Hey.

How long you going to be
doing that on Pacific?

As long as it takes.

Why you getting like
all gloomy and shit?

Not even. Stupid.

Stupid.

We're gonna meet
at the shop tomorrow?

Yeah, don't worry.
I'll make it work.

I'm just saying...

I know, Yoli.
But it's not all I'm about.

(TV plays in the background)

And your homework?

I'm going to do it right now.

That's good.

Ok, stop.

Stop! Stop!

Stop.

First tell me what
you're thinking about.

Nothing...

Just about my parents.

What about them?

I was remembering this one day,
awhile back.

My dad put on this CD he bought
off this guy on Pacific.

He put it on then went and
pulled out this old cowboy hat

I've never seen him in.

Then he approached my mom

and then they waltzed
around the room...

Not caring about their usual,

resting up for work
the next day.

It was like they were
somewhere else for that moment.

It was kinda beautiful.

You think too much.

Come on, scaredy-cat.

What about your father?

He died.
Some sort of accident...

He used to drive one of those
big-ass 18-wheelers

up, down,
and all around this place.

Did he ever take you for a ride?

No...

He was always just too
happy to be home with us.

At least everyday
was different for him.

Different like today.

(siren wails)

(both singing)
They started to play...

To play...

Dancing with death!

I got to go...

Here.

Some guy who flyers
keeps eyeballing my shit.

This?

Fool, that's a classic.

(Music plays from the Walkman)

?

<i>Yolanda!</i>

<i>Yolanda!</i>

What are you doing?

You went into
your father's closet.

And those?

They let me borrow it.

Let me see.

(Music plays from the Walkman)

Shall we dance?

What, Mom?

Return it
to your father's closet.

What was it like
when you met Dad?

When you danced
for the first time?

What are you talking about?

You know...

Life stuff.

We've made it perfectly clear

that the only thing you
need to worry about is school.

Concentrate on that.

I'm not busting my ass all day
so you can throw it away.

I was just asking a question.

Photos and videos.

Photos for passports.

Thank you.

You making something
good for dinner?

They let us out early
from the factory.

I think there was a spill.

Gives me a chance
to cook for my two girls.

You must have your
hands full with two girls.

By any chance, do you
know of a job around here?

Not off hand, but I can
keep an eye out.

Or you can ask your eldest.
She seems to know.

You have something to tell me
about my daughter?

Well, only what I've heard.

I heard she's been flyering
for one of the local stores.

Sometimes till late.

There's nothing wrong
with helping her family,

you understand me?

That was my story
when I was young

and you never know to
what extent you have to go.

You understand me?

Must be another girl.

Thank you, Don Pedro.

Where did you find
your father's medallion?

In one of your drawers.

Under a bunch of crap.

Your father would be
disappointed in you...

In the streets as if you
didn't have a mother.

Maybe he's proud of me
because I'm making sure

we have a chance,
like how he wanted.

Give me a break, Mari.

You barely make enough
for rent, and now we got it.

Your father and I
wanted you to get school.

Having a green card
gets you an education.

I already figured that out.

I made them find one.
Sorry it took so long, Mari.

Cool.

I never thought I'd hear you
say that about a textbook.

Cool for when I can't
meet up with you.

You know, makes it easier.

We're going to meet up at
the shop today, aren't we?

Nah, I got that other stuff
to do, remember?

I'll go with you.

Why not?

Crazy! That's not you.

How do you know that's not me?

I ain't playing, Yoli.

I can do my work at home.
Don't trip.

Don't even trip, girl.
We got your back.

We got plans for us to kick it
after school and just have fun.

(Chattering, gossiping)

So are you like a freshman,
a junior, a sophomore?

No, I'm a sophomore.

I remember when I
used to be a sophomore.


So you're a junior?

Yeah.

Oh, that's cool.

Yeah, you like it?

Yeah, so far.

I like your braid!

It's really long.
Who did it for you?

I can braid it
for you sometime.

That's be cool!

So who was that?

My best friend.

Need to talk to her
or something?

Are you sure?

Yeah.

So you want to come?

No, I'm ok.

Come with us, Yoli!
You'll have fun.

No, I'm ok.

Giving up the studies to hang
out with your little boyfriend?

He's not my boyfriend.

Yeah, he's probably a faggot.

He's just someone me and
Las Cuatas know from school.

Why do you care?

Please.

If you want to hang out
with the twiddle-dums

and the rest of them,
that's on you, stupid.

Stupid you.

Yeah, whatever.

Yeah, whatever.

Photos and videos.

Photos for passports.

The Walkman.
You told me to hold onto it

so that guy
doesn't eyeball it.

Go play with your little
boyfriend or something.

Boo!

Come on, let's go!

Am I speaking Chinese
or something? Come on!

This ain't even
a real video game, Mari.

Yeah, it's a piece of shit!

Dude, not even!
I'm not on your lane!

Old lady.

You drive like my grandma.

Oh, is that right?

Oh, look at me!
I'm coming up in second.

That's right. Touch it now!

That's what I thought!


I don't have anymore change.

Mosquita!

(Music plays from the Walkman)

It's my jam right here!

(Both singing to song)

I didn't see you on Pacific.

I was flyering the cars along
the side streets.

Thank you.

Mrs. Rodriguez, how are things
with you and Mari?

Don't worry about us, Don Pedro.

Everything is good.

Let me introduce myself.

I'm Cruz Olveros
and this is my husband.

Thank you for
letting your daughter

help my daughter
with her schoolwork.

It's always nice to
have Mari in the house.

Such a good kid.

You all should talk more often.

Raising two
15-year-old girls is not easy.

In this day and age with the
youth and who they are

and the things
that happen sometimes.

What do you want to say
about our daughters?

It's not like I want
to gossip or anything--

Just spit it out.

Someone told me
that one of the girls

got into a car with someone.

You know what can happen
when someone gets in a car.

I don't see what's so unusual
about getting into a car.

Stepping into a car isn't,
but getting into a car is.

With all due respect,
that's all ridiculous.

Well, I had two kids
because I got into a car.

Mari doesn't have time
to get into cars with boys.

Or maybe she's finding the time.

My daughter is too smart to
be getting into cars with boys.

As you can see, not that smart.

I'm sure they're referring
to some other girls.

Not our daughters.

Excuse us.

I agree.

Maybe I should
get my driver's license.

I can get one
now that I'm 15.

For that, you need a permit.

What?

Is he giving you money?

What?

The boy you're spending
all your time with.

Is he giving you money?

Is that how
we've been paying rent?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Playing dumb
isn't your strong suit.

They have you
working too hard over there.

I asked you a question!

There is no boy!

Mom, what are you
doing in there?

How was school?

Fine.

And on your walks back home?

The same.

The same?

Yes, Mom, the same.

Ok.

Don't you usually
walk with Mari?

It would be nice if you did.
Walk to school together.

Ok, Mom.

To school and back.

Together.

Ok, Mom.

Go on and finish showering.

Tell me something...

Something you never told anyone.

I was five when we left
my grandma to come here.

My dad wanted her to
come with us, but she refused.

I still remember how
everyone was afraid of her

because she took care
of hers no matter what.

But she would always take me
on these walks to this river,

and we'd make tortas
with beans and cheese.

And we'd eat until we
couldn't take it anymore.

And we'd just lay there
and watch the birds fly.

She said if I really wanted to,

I could hear the wind
going through their feathers

as they flapped by.

And I swear to you,
for a moment, I could.

Ten years from now,
I'm gonna save up

and visit my grandma
in Xalapa Mexico.

By then, who cares
if I can't make it back?

Ten years from now,
I want to--

Be a doctor or lawyer.

I don't even know.

Maybe a truck driver?

Are you gonna ride with me?

You can take me
to my grandma's.

You can stay if you want.

Yeah, I could see that.

Yoli.

Hello.

You gotta get back
to your homework!

Yoli! Yoli!

Yoli!

Yolanda!

Come on! I'm ready.

Put a streak on each side,

and these are going to
look real cute, ok?

Yolanda?

Are those permanent?

Mr. Galvez wants to see us.

Why?

Why haven't we seen
any of your latest tests

posted on the refrigerator?

We'll see.

Yolanda is one of
my best students.

That's why I am
a bit concerned

that her grades
have been declining.

Maybe you've been preoccupied
helping out your friend Mari.

Is there something happening
to you here at school?

No.

Is someone harassing you?

No.

Lately you've had
your head in the clouds.

Thank you very much, professor,
for letting us know.

Thank you for coming.

Anything else,
please let us know.

Of course.

Thank you.

Yolanda...

Look, um. I've got
these college pamphlets

and I was thinking maybe
you could take a look at them.

And we could talk about how
to get you a tour to visit them.

You know? Maybe one weekend?

That sound exciting?

Yeah.
Ok.

We don't have to
return to Mexico

to be reminded of
what poverty looks like.

It's just a few blocks
away from us.

Your mother and I
work very hard

to make sure your future
is far from this.

What we endure everyday
at work for years

isn't enough for you
to get it?

But I never said
I wasn't going to college.

Any obstacle
that gets in your way,

you can just move aside.

And that includes any boy.
What?

Don't play
the deaf one, Yolanda.

This isn't the moment for that.

Your future is too important for
you to have this attitude.

Ok Dad, I know.

It doesn't appear that way.

Don't lose sight
of what you have

right in front of you.

Yeah, like you.

What was that?

Nothing.

You listening to me, Yolanda?

Yes.

I won't lose sight.

Mari?

Yeah?

No chocolate.
Peanut butter and jelly ok?

Yeah.

Alright.

It looks nice.

Come on.

We just want one picture.
Is that ok?

Yes, that's ok.

Thank you.

Oh, come on.
Not like this.

Like this.

See! That's what
I'm talking about.

That says, "I'm here!"

No... "We're here."

Yeah, it's me and you for life.

Your parents?

Don Pedro's.

(Music plays from the stereo)

Just for a little bit.
I'm cold, Mari.

Ok, but just for a little bit.

You're probably going to go
far way for college, huh?

Wherever they accept us -
here, somewhere else.

Us?

I'm not helping you for nothing.

I can't afford it.

We'll figure it out.

Yeah?

We'll get into school.
We'll get away.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Hi, girls!

Hi, girls.

Excuse me, I have to go
take care of my sister.

What's going on with her?

Yolanda, I'm talking to you.
What's going on with her?

What were you two up to?

Studying for our finals.

And how did it go?

We'll be ready for them.

That's what I like to hear.

It's the end of the month.

Please give me a chance
to make more than this.

I'm sorry, Mari.

It's just been too slow.

The flyering
hasn't given me results.

I have to let you go.

Do you need any help
in the store?

No?

Excuse me, but do you need help
with something by any chance?

In anything? No?

<i>How much will you</i>
<i>give me for this?</i>

<i>We'll give you fifteen.</i>

Only fifteen?

They're hard to find.
It's a classic.

Fifteen.

I got a booger on my face
or something?

Stupid.

Then?

Yesterday, was kinda...
I don't know.

You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

Ok.

You can be
so annoying sometimes.

You know that guy
from the other day?

Las Cuatas' friend...

Well, he asked me
to be his girlfriend.

He's more stupider
than I thought.

Well, maybe I should say yes.

Why not?

If you don't want me to,
I won't.

I already told you what I think.

Yeah, but--

Who cares? Just say yes.

I got real things
to be thinking about.

Not that dumb kid shit.

Mari!
What!

Don't forget about
the final on Monday.

Flyering going ok?

Yes.

I have a co-worker...

She said she turned
her garage into a studio.

And it came out really nice.

Even though it's a little
crowded for three.

They pay me
in a couple of days.

You don't have
to get all dramatic.

I'm sorry.

Forget about it.

Ok! All your books, notes,
backpacks under your desks.

Nothing but pens, pencils,
and calculators out.

Just relax. You'll all do great.

Ok! Everyone with a test,
you may begin!

You may begin.

Good luck.

You too.

(Students chattering)

Come on Saturdays,

ladies get in free
before midnight!

Hi, how are you?
Every Saturday night...

I can help you flyer.

I'm not flyering. I'm promoting.

Doesn't matter.
I can still help you.

You're too young
to be doing this.

Come on, man. Hurry up.

You need money, don't you?

Yes, but it's not for sale.

Then, what is?

Perv.

Join us every Saturday night.

Mari!

Hey!

<i>That's enough!</i>

Hey!

What the hell's
going on with you?

I'm sure that boy is
the cause of this nonsense.

[knocking on door]

Everything ok?

Are you ok?

We'll leave you alone.

(School bell rings)

Mr. G, can I take
Mari's final to her?

Sorry, Yolanda. Not a final.

She's gonna have
to come get it herself.

Thanks, Mr. G.

Good work!

Have you seen Mari?

Who the hell is she?

My best friend.

Are you playing
elementary school games?

No!

You know what, go to hell.

Wait!

We made a deal.

?

What's wrong?

I'm tired, Mom.

My love.

(loud music plays,
kids laughing)

Scoot over, Yoli.

I like this song!

Yoli, you're gonna
start again

with that
holy santita bullshit?

No, I've done it before.

Well, then hit it!

What's wrong?

Stop the car. Stop the car!

What the hell, Yoli!

Look, stop!

It's ok, dude. Ok?
Just on a trip.

Just get back in the car.
You'll feel much better!

Just shut up, Cuata!
I'm walking home.

Yoli, don't be like that.

Alright, then go!
I will!

You know, it's not like
we give a shit!

Good! Cuz I don't
give a shit either!

Let's just go, Cuata.
