Hey, sexy, let's go.

Yo, Chu Chu...

No, I'm out, man. He's coming.

It's a rap. He's coming!

No, he's coming.

Tell Smoke his punk-ass

was supposed to be here
30 minutes ago.

Instead he out there hiding.

Instead of coming
and facing me like a man.

Listen, Chu Chu,
he'll be here.

No, that's bullshit.
I'm out.

He'll be here.

I want my money.

Listen, if you ask me,

he's just waiting
to make an entrance.

Look out,
little girl.

All right, I'll give him
five minutes.

No, make it one.

Black Knights!

Hear ye! Hear ye!
Gather 'round!

Black Knights in town.

And all you mere mortals
need to bow that ass down!

If you have never seen Smoke
do his thing on a motorcycle

then you have never seen

a brother on a motorcycle
do his thing.

Oh, glory be to God,

y'all, 'cause you know
He had a vision.

He put Arthur Ashe on the clay,

Jackie Robinson on the diamond,

Muhammad Ali in the ring
and my man, Smoke,

on the two wheels!

So don't be s-s-stuttering
and standing your ass around.

Get down on your knees
and bow that ass down.

Word!

He's still gonna lose.

Slick Will.

Right on, brother.

What up, Kid?

Hey.

<i>Long as I can remember,</i>

<i>my dad and Smoke</i>
<i>were best friends.</i>

<i>As long as anyone can remember,</i>
<i>Smoke was known</i>

<i>as "The King of Cali."</i>

<i>But if anyone outraced him,</i>
<i>they could win his crown.</i>

203 races.

I ain't found nobody with enough
ride to take this from me.

Let's make it a lot better.
Two grand.

Sound like money
in the bank to me.

Cha-ching.

<i>The deal was,</i>
<i>a lot of people had dreams</i>

<i>of one day winning that crown.</i>

You all right?

Yeah, I just needed
more acceleration.

Yeah, and you would've
fallen on your behind

a lot faster.

Come on, let's get this.

All right, Dad.

Here we go.
One, two, three.

Go help get Smoke's ride
off the truck, all right?

Damn!

Damn!

Damn.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

You're sort of in my path.

I like the way you put that.

Put what?

You could've said
I was in your way.

But you said I
was in your path.

You know, it's like
me and your paths

are meant to cross.

Feel what I'm saying?

No.

Anyway, my name is Kid.

You want a medal
for that or something?

I just want some
conversation, that's all.

Just a little conversation.

Hmm.

Well, there's
only one problem, Kid.

What's that, beautiful?

I don't converse
with prospects.

Excuse me.

<i>A prospect.</i>

<i>I was at the bottom.</i>

<i>I wanted to be recognized</i>
<i>as a true rider.</i>

<i>Especially from my dad.</i>

Dad. Dad!

What?

When do I get my colors?

What?

I'm saying,
this prospect thing...

I can't roll
like this no more.

That's Smoke's call, boy.

Good, man. Good.

Damn, Will,
she is tight.

<i>The way I saw it,</i>
<i>my concerns were not his.</i>

<i>Being Smoke's mechanic,</i>
<i>there was only one rider</i>

<i>my dad seemed to care about.</i>

Nice work, Will.

Hey, thanks, baby.

You, too, Kid.

Hey, Smoke, listen, man.

Burn rubber,
not your soul, baby.

Burn rubber, not your soul.

I don't see why we stay up
all night fixing his bike

while he takin'
all the bows.

First of all, "we" didn't
stay up all night, I did.

You fell asleep, remember?

Second of all, you know,
Smoke always tells me

that when he lines
his bike up for a race,

he doesn't see anything,
he doesn't hear anything.

Just a finish line.

A cat like that gets in the
zone... that's a gift from God.

Sound like bullshit to me.

Well, you should wish
you could be half as good.

<i>My dad once said the difference</i>
<i>between men and boys</i>

<i>is the lessons they learn.</i>

<i>Well, my father</i>
<i>taught me plenty.</i>

Is that nitrous I smell

up underneath that
bike, Chu Chu?

What you smell is your ass,
which I'm about to take.

No, what I'm smellin'
is victory, brother,

'cause, by the time you get
to second gear to kick it in,

I'll be across the finish line

and all you gonna smell
is my smoke.

And that's when you gonna
wake up and realize

the only reason you smoked
so much ass up in Fresno

is because I wasn't in it.

I bet a G on Smoke.

You take Chu Chu.

Chu Chu? Aw, hell, no.
Not Chu Chu, man.

See, Slick Will is almost
as good a mechanic as me.

Almost.

You gon' have
to take Chu Chu.

You must be crazy.

Brothers,
when the green light turns red.

Smoke, Chu Chu.

All right.

Let me tell you something.

Bottom line: I don't want
to hear all of this.

Somebody ain't got my money.

Why it got to be like that?

Let's go, baby!
Come on!

Go! Go!

Yes!

Yeah!

Oh!

Will!

Come on, hurry up, man!

Will! Will!

Hey, get an ambulance!

My God!

Breathe!
Now, breathe!

Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!

Don't nobody touch him.

...thank you for the life
of William Alex Crooms.

If it's all
right with you,

we'd like this
buried with him.

Everybody has signed it.

He'd be proud to have this.

Look, Nita, if you need
anything, money, anything,

come to me first,
I got you.

You all right?

Just got to get
out of here, man.

Jalil, you know I don't want him
playing those violent games.

It's not that violent,
is it, Willie?

Nope, it ain't
that violent.

Okay, that's it.

You go to bed

brush your teeth

and take them little
cruddy shoes with you.

Hey, hey.

Five more minutes

on that phone,
then I want you off.

We're going over homework.

Oh, I was not born
yesterday, Miss Thing.

Five minutes.

All right, scrub,
move on over.

Oh, yeah, let Mama
give that baby

a little spanking,
come on.

Okay.

Let's see what
you're working with.

You're the scrub.

Honey, your mama
got skills.

Ooh.
That must've hurt.

Boy, you still alive?

Go on, lay down and die.

You're injured?

Let me just finish
you off... here you go.

Ooh!

Hey!

Man!

That's all right, baby.

I'll give you a rematch.

It is all right.

Yeah, I know it's okay.

I'm gonna go get me
something to eat.

Boy, you just ate dinner
an hour ago.

Stop tripping.

Jalil...

you be careful.

Don't worry about me.

I usually only get
gunned down once a night.

Cee Cee! Cee Cee!

Off the phone now!

Donny!

Yo, Donny, come on,
I'm calling you out!

Donny!

Go on. Ten dollars.
Have your cash ready.

Donny, come on out!

Yo, what's up, Jerome?

Kid? Oh, shit, Kid!

Yo, dawg!
Put me down, man!

Hey, where the hell
you been, brother?!

Man, ain't nobody
seen you since...

Any-anyway, man, it's good
to see you again, dawg!

Yeah.

I have $500 that says
I'm gonna take your helmet.

That's a funny dude.

I'm gonna go bust
his fool ass.

Now, hold on.
Is Donny here yet?

Yeah, he's here.

I mean, if you want me to,
I'll tell Donny what's up.

Have Donny bust that fool,
feel me?

Donny.

Yeah.

Yo, Kid, don't be such a
stranger, man, come on.

Whoo! Looks good.

Yeah, you hooked
this one up.

It looks real good.

You're gonna have
to keep this on here

for another day
at least, though.

Mm-hmm.

Yo, I need you
to hook me up.

I got this new girl
who want to get a tattoo, right?

Uh-huh.

She want to put my name
on her cheek.

I take it you don't
mean on her face.

Mm-mm. 

Uh-uh.

You know how I do...
I got to brand my women.

Uh-uh.
Right on their ass.

Yo, what's up, Donny?

Who the hell are you?

Yo, yo, yo

that's Slick
Will's son.

Okay. Wassup?

You too big to
pay respects, Kid?

How you doing,
Queenie?

I'm a'ight.

How you doing?

Guess I'm all right.

Yo, I thought
you might

want to know... some drunk fool

calling you out.

That fool?

I beat him last week
for 200 bucks.

Oh, you know, man,
he talking about 500

and your lid.

What?!

You set that up, for real.

</i>

So what the hell
you doing?

Getting ready to race you.

Without a lid?

You're not just drunk,
you crazy.

Just consider it a reminder
in case you glance at me.

Reminder of what?

That your lid's
about to become mine.

Yeah, right!

What's happening?
Girl, what's happening now?

Whoa, lookit,
the queen has came out.

Hey, Queenie,
you up next?

Donny!

What's happening, T.J.?

Got us
a race here, huh?

Oh, yeah.
We about to get

into this boy ass
right here.

Whoa.

Where'd you get your bike, boy?
Off eBay?

Good luck to you.

Hey, how you doing?

Yeah!

Kick some ass.

Keep the wheels down, boys.

Hey, doll, wassup?
Wassup, wassup?

Kid!

I don't know
what the hell

your fool ass
was trying to prove...

but whatever it was,
you proved it.

I-I think I just won.

Yeah, you did.

Fill it up.

You get any
of my messages?

I've been kind of busy.

Talk to you
for a second?

I see you got your bike
running kind of right.

Oh, you think?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Shit.

I'm almost impressed, Kid.

You could've got hurt
real bad out there, man.

I could've got hurt
getting out of the bed.

True that, but we
got rules on the set.

You can't just roll
up through here

with no colors on,
pulling tricks, man.

People cutting you
some slack

'cause of your old man,
I'm tellin' ya.

Look, Kid, if you don't want
any problems, a'ight...

What? You act like you're
about to do something.

Oh, I forgot.

I'm supposed to jump
when you say "jump"?

I'm not my father,
all right?

And what's that
supposed to mean?

It means I'm not
kissing your ass

the way he did.

Before he died

he said I should wish
to be as good as you are.

Well, he was wrong...

'cause I'm better.

Now would be a good time
for you to get on your bike

and take your ass home.

I can't do that, Smoke.

I'm calling your ass out!

Figured you'd bitch up.

One race...

and you talking shit? Hmm?

You want a piece of me,
Kid? Huh?

You want a piece of me?

Get you some colors,

you win you
some legit races,

and then,
maybe you'll get your shot.

When you step to me, Kid,
you better come correct.

Hey, Smoke.

Why don't you let me
handle this?

Some happy boy
comes through

messing up one of my events,
we got ways of dealing with him.

It's all right, T.J.

Kid was just
breaking out, y'all.

Ain't that right, Kid?

Oh, no doubt.

Come on, baby.

T.All right.

Let's get back to partying.

Drinks on the house
for another hour.

If you were gonna pull
some shit like that,

you could've let
a brother know.

Hey, man, it just happened.

No, no!

Racing against
me doesn't

just happen... no, man, that's...
I mean...

We got paid, man.

What can I get you?

I'll have a Coke.

Anything else?

Yeah, I'll take a Coke
myself, sweetheart

and a cheeseburger.

I'm starving, yo!

Wassup, Kid?

So, how you been,
Stuntman?

Who are you?

Oh, my name's Primo.

Dawgs, that was some gansta-ass
riding you did tonight, man!

Though I wonder
what Donny would think

if he knew the white boy
was your friend.

We ain't friends.

Oh, no?

Nah, we just like to
eat at the same place.

It's a
coincidence.

You know,
that's funny

'cause I know a little something
about coincidences.

Is that so?

Yeah. You'll
like this one.

Two months ago, some
brother rolls through

Los Vaqueros' annual
dance in Oaktown.

It's not unusual
for a black guy

to roll through
every now and then,

but what is unusual

is for this black guy
to tell Los Vaqueros

that a drunk white
boy wants to race?!

One who races
with no lid.

Man.

See, the guy who the white boy
happened to beat was my cousin.

That's a
coincidence.

Yeah, it is
a coincidence.

Look, man, y'all worked
y'all's game in Northern Cali,

and now you're gonna
squeeze out L.A.,

and I'm saying,
do your thing.

I feel that.

But I think y'all a little
too close to home, man,

to be using
that same-ass M.O.

Thank you for
the advice, Primer...

or Primo, whatever.

Look, man, if you had
a third guy, for example,

and ran a totally
different hustle...

Oh, oh.

...it'd keep people
off your ass.

I mean, shit,
all anyone has to do

is figure out where
the annual dance is,

and there you are.

Look, man,
we're not hustling no more.

Really?

Really.

We're going legit.

We are?

You're going after
Smoke's crown, aren't you?

Oh, yeah, that's
what we're doing.

C-Can you tell this guy
he's crazy

so we can eat
in peace?

Yeah, tell me I'm crazy, Kid.

Tell me I'm crazy.

Look, man

Smoke doesn't have
to chase any more wallets.

He's got the crown.

He's the King of Cali.

Yeah, and...

And he told me
to step to him correctly,

so that's what
I'm doing.

I'm stepping
to him correctly.

Yeah, but the
only damn way

to step to
him correctly

is to join one of
the clubs on set.

Actually, actually, actually...

actually...
there's another way.

We could start our own club.

"We"? "We"?

Yeah.

Yo, it takes three
to be official

and think about
how much money we can make

if we joined up together.

A lot more than $500
a race, believe me.

Well, believe this.

We can always find
a third head.

That's true, but you're
not gonna find nobody

as fast as me, Kid.

Come on, baby.

Well, maybe
if you can keep up,

then we have something
we can talk about.

Keep up.

Hey, oh, nah...

Step up or
step off, son.

Step up or step off.
Step up or step off.

Yo, Stunt, let's show him
how to do it, baby.

Oh!

Come on, Primo!

You got blocks!
Keep up, son!

Come on, baby, let's go now!

Whoo!

Whoo!

My name's Primo.

You ain't gonna forget
that name.

What you think, Kid?

He got skills.

Way to step
up, son!

Ha, ha! Come on.

Yeah.

Hey, man!

Whoo!
Ow!

Ow.

Baby-girl, now you got
to make sure

that the, uh, "D"
is nice and straight.

Oh!

I mean, it's looking
a little crooked right here.

Wood? Move.

What? I'm saying
you got to...

Move!

All right.
Look, here.

Hurry up.

I got to get back
to the shop, you know?

I'm still on
the clock.

Hey, sweetie,
I told you my sister

was a pro, right?

Uh-huh.

She's gonna take care
of you. Mmm! Mmm.

Oh, baby?

Hmm?

You're gonna put my name
on yours, too, right?

What?

Well...

Uh, yeah, baby-boo.

I got you.
You know.

It hurts?

Yeah.

You can take
the pain.

You say you
like the look.

Wow. What's up, baby?

How did you...?

What-what in the hell
are you doing here?

Came to get me a tattoo.

Okay, look, you
can't just stop by.

You have to make
an appointment.

You see me race
the other day?

Yeah. I saw you race.

I think you're crazy.

Well, I think
some people like crazy.

Look, I'm kind of busy,
so, um... um...

if you want to make
an appointment...

here.

You can call
my voice mail.

Your voice mail?

My voice mail.

A'ight.

Anything else?

Yeah, um...

I wasn't trying to cause static
at the dance.

I was just trying
to show off my bike.

Things got out of control,
so, I apologize to you, T.J.

I understand that.

But, you see,
I ain't the only one

you should be apologizing to.

I apologize.

Word is you've
been kicking it

with that white boy
that raced Donny.

There a law against that?

No. Just wondering
if you met him

before the race or after.

After.

'Cause we got a strict code
about hustling.

You either deal straight up,
or not at all.

I'm just as straight up as you.

So, you're taking

college classes
and fixing bikes part-time?

That's right.

Following in your
father's footsteps?

In some things.

All right, if we agree
to vote you in,

your club will
be recognized.

But if you're
not voted in

you can come again
before us in a year.

I understand that.

Good for you.

All those in favor of Kid's club
being recognized...

acknowledge.

So what y'all going
to call yourself?

You okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

Okay.

'Cause, um... I just thought

it might hurt a little.

No. It's all good.

It kind of helps
if you breathe a little bit.

Just...

Breathe.

You know, Tina...

I'm really feeling you.

Feeling me?

Yeah.

You know, I mean,
I like you a lot.

Kid, how would you know that?

You hardly even know me.

I just know.

That's all, you know?

So, what does this mean?

Oh... uh...

It's something my dad,
uh... used to say.

It means, uh, whatever,
whoever steps to you...

just remember who you are.

You know... keep it real.

I know about
what happened to him.

I'm sorry.

Can't imagine how
you're dealing with it.

Life's jacked up.

You know, just, uh...

learn how to deal
with it, you know?

I guess so.

Yeah.

Oh... I forgot to thank you
for my flowers.

Thank you.

You know, I never flowed
like that before.

Never... you know,
bought flowers

for a girl.

Yeah, I could tell.

Yeah?

Um...

Picked them out myself.

I can tell that, too.

Come here.

Come here.

Think of
the sexiest girl

Think of
the sexiest girl

you ever seen
in your life...

the sexiest...
and I'm telling you

Shorty was sexier
than that.

And she was checking you out?

No, she was drooling
all over me, son.

So, you know, I start
talking to Shorty, right?

She telling me
she been racing

for, like, two years,

and she want to race me
for 500 beans.

Now, that sound
like easy money.

Yo, as fine as she is,

I'm thinking
the same thing.

Only she ain't
got no money.

So, she says if I win,
I get whatever I want.

Whoa.

So, did you win?

What you think?

So, I takes her back
to the motel

to settle our debt, right?

And Shorty starts
kissing on me...

You know what
I'm saying?

Starts twirling
her tongue in my ear

and I'm saying, son,
that's my spot.

Don't twirl the tongue
in my ear.

No, that's a little more
than I need to know.

Hold up; you took her
back to the motel

and you only got
a ear job?

Hee-hee-hee, shut up.

That ain't funny.

Anyway, so before I could
tell Shorty to chill,

she got me handcuffed
to the headboard like... blah!

Oh...
Nice.

Next thing I know, five
of her friends come storming in.

Oh...
Nice.

No, see,
you're not hearing me, man.

It's not coming
through your head.

This ain't no
S & M bruise.

They beat the shit out of me,

stole my money,
stole my clothes...

and I had to ride home
butt-naked, yo.

And there was like this
big-ass traffic jam,

'cause everybody
got out they car

to laugh at me.

I nearly burned my nuts off
on the way home.

Yo, man...

Yo, we a motorcycle club, right?

We supposed to stick together
at times like this, right?

You're just going to
laugh at me like that?

Huh? At least help me
get my money back, man.

That's messed up, man.

That's mad messed up.

On behalf of all
the club presidents,

we want to thank you
for coming out.

This is our fourth annual
Bikini Bike Wash.

And every dime

raised here today
goes towards purchasing

schoolbooks for kids
in our community.

So, if you got a dirty bike,

this is where you want to be.

And if you got a clean bike,
this is where you want to be.

Now, please, give a warm welcome

to our motorcycle
sanitation engineers!

Come on.

Damn.

Come on. Come on.

Hang on, hang on, hang on!

Before all you sisters
get too salty,

please say hello to Turbo.

Oh...!

No, no, no, no!

What?

Yo, man, that's what
I'm talking about.

Do they come any tighter,
them shorts he got on?

I ain't feeling that
right there.

All they need
is the Train, baby!

All you need is the
chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a...

Soul Train!

I think, um, you
need to cool off.

Hey, you... I see you.

If there's one bike out here

that doesn't need
to be cleaned, it's yours.

Well, it's for charity.

Ah... charity.

Speaking of charity,
where's, um...

uh... Donny?

I really wouldn't know.

Well, ain't
y'all involved?

Brothers and commitment.

You know about that one,
don't you?

That again.

Mmm. I suppose
it didn't help matters

that I beat him in a race.

You could've let him win.

Like I let you win?

Like you let me win?

Don't let me keep you, huh?

Wouldn't want you
to feel "smothered."

I'm up next.

Hey, yo, Kid!

These guys want
to talk to you.

Hey, Kid, I'm Philly.

What's up, man?

And I'm Flip.
What's going on?

Yo, we saw you race
Donny a while back.

Yo, we saw you beat
Big Gee a week ago.

Your flow was
off the chain.

Off the heezy.

Yo, now that you got
your own crew and all,

we was hoping to join up.

What?

I mean, we know
that we got to be

prospects for a while,

but whatever it takes to become
Biker Boyz, we'll do it.

Whatever it takes?
No doubt.

Don't jump, Smoke.

It can't be that bad.

Well, if it ain't Dogg...

"man's best friend."

Hey! Hey! Fetch!

Why don't you hang it up?

You haven't raced
anybody credible

since the accident.

Oh, that's 'cause
you think

you're the only one
who's credible.

Think?

Only reason you beat me
up in Fresno

is 'cause my piston
got jacked up.

That shit
ain't happening again.

Good. You need to get in
line and wait your turn

like everybody else.

Ain't nobody else,

except you.

I been watching you...
riding safe, careful...

not taking any chances.

You ain't got the heart
to be King of Cali.

Not no more.

I can see that
in your eyes.

You sure that's
what you see?

Look again.

I'll tell you what
you see, you mutt.

You see somebody who's
got everything you want.

Somebody who's
got three Gs

that says you ain't got
the heart to take it.

Three Gs?

How about five?

How about five?

Five, baby.

Wait up!

You see that?
You see that?

Go! Come on! Yeah!

Baby, that's what
I'm talking about.

Ooh! Ooh!

That's right.
Give it up.

Get your little ass
on over there, homeboy.

Where there's smoke,
there's fire!

Fire!
Fire!

Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

Say something for the people
at home, baby.

Get out of my face
with that camera!

Yo, Dogg, now that's
what I call a race.

Couldn't get no closer.

Yo, baby, say something
for the folks at home, man.

Let them know
what's going on, Dogg.

Just a little something
for them, baby.

Damn, Kamera Man.

You next, fool.

You next.

You got smoked, baby.

Don't even sweat that, man.

Don't even sweat it.

Soul Train?

Yes, sir?

How much does that doggy
in the window owe me?

His life, Smoke.

He owe you his life.

That's a good Dogg.

Hey, ain't you
forgetting something?

Come on, boy.

Come on, you
can do it, boy.

Come on, boy.

Here, boy! Here, boy!

Come on.

That's a good Dogg.

That's a good Dogg.

Come on!

Why don't you fetch that?

Bad Dogg.

That ain't no dog, Smoke.

That's a bitch.

That's a doggone shame.

We gonna tell you
a little story here.

You want to hear that?

Tell you a little story
about a boy named Dogg.

Quarter mile race,
need to be up on a hog.

Then one day
he came against the Smoke.

Got to the line
and all he did was choke.

Smoked, that is.

Black Knight!

That's right. Keep going.

I thought you were
supposed to race before me.

We were.

I guess you're
not the only one

who likes to make
an entrance.

T.J.

Let's ride.

Can't do it.

Can't hold the bridge
any longer.

What?

Maybe next time you'll
leave out the halftime show.

Maybe next time
you'll take some notes.

We racing?

Or you making upan excuse?
