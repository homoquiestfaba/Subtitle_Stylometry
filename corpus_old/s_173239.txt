This bit was really difficult.

I always remember the idea here,
talking with Hans and Julian,

was to get this huge overblown intro

that almost had
a Star Wars/Wizard of Oz feel,

you know, so people thought
we'd gone really Hollywood.

But then when the characters appear,
you're really back down

in Wallace and Gromit's
British territory.

Yeah, yeah.

It's really nice the way
this captures people immediately,

and gives a bit of a backstory
as well to the whole film

and introduces it to people

who aren't necessarily familiar
with Wallace and Gromit.

I think it was probably the last shot
we did in the shooting.

Yeah. With much discussion.

I know, we were both quite reluctant
to put this sequence in.

Yeah.

I mean, it is a danger...
It could have seemed added on,

but... it seems a nice kind of way

just to get into a new,

a whole new film years after people
might have seen Wallace and Gromit.

We're so keen on,
I think, capturing the genre

and it's so important for us that,

you know, to have that, especially
with this, that horror feeling

that it kind of... It did...

It could have had a danger
of being tagged on.

Yeah. The original idea we had
was that the camera would just be

kind of roving across the moors through
the fog and up to the moon like that,

and then coming to the policeman's
footprint like that in the puddle.

And we far preferred that idea,

but I think it was suggested
that we're just taking too long

to get into the movie
and into the comedy.

There was a lot of talk
of allowing the audience

to know they can laugh,
which was a good move.

PO Mac there just walked
straight past Harvey's vegetable shop

and for a long, long time

there was extra footage there

of Peter Kay cracking
these jokes about a big moth

that had frightened the policeman.

Unfortunately it got cut out in the end
to keep the film moving.

Yeah.

There was going to be a shadow
creeping up behind him

as he looked at the poster,
and it turned out to be just a moth

in lamplight with kind of feelers
that looked like big ears.

There was probably about a minute's
worth of footage cut out there.

It's probably one of the big losses.

There's already
an introduction of, you know,

knowing there are gonna be a lot
more characters in the movie there.

In the other Wallace and Gromit films,

you know,
Wallace and Gromit are always there,

plus maybe one or two other characters.

And we felt that the whole world
had to open up for this movie,

but somehow still retain its colloquial,

local, small feel.

Yeah.

The music on this bit
was a big issue for quite a long time,

keeping it, really ramping it up

and making the movie
an exciting beginning,

yet at the same time,
keeping that kind of smallness,

as you say,
of Wallace and Gromit as well.

I think, you know, Julian Nott,

who wrote the music
along with Hans Zimmer,

who was fantastic to work with,

just created a fantastic score.

I adore the music for the film.

It's lovely.
Yeah.

I remember a joke here,
Nick, that we wanted

to reprise Wallace
and Gromit's kind of launch,

like you did in Olose Shave,
but we wanted an extra twist on it.

We had a joke for a long time that
they came out of the front of the house,

and after all that palaver
of getting ready,

that Mrs. Mulch's
was actually next door.

They just drove out
to the road and back.

It was incredibly difficult
just to get that across,

that it was to show the geography,
that it was just next door.

Yeah.

We had so many versions
of this little sequence,

of how to make this funny.

Gosh, the amount of times we boarded
and re-boarded, even earlier than this,

when the rabbit comes
into Wallace and Gromit's garden,

of how to get it right.

I always wonder though whether we...

You know, we were so keen
on trying to pull off this idea

that there was some kind
of beast in the town already,

that maybe the Were-Rabbit
already existed

and what they were trying
to capture was something large,

and I don't know truly
whether it fully comes off

that it actually turns out
to be a little rabbit.

That false teeth joke there
was very last-minute addition

to get an extra laugh.

I think there was
a general feeling that there wasn't...

People weren't starting to laugh
enough early enough in the film,

from test screenings we had.

That always gets a big laugh.

This is one of those sequences
that went backwards and forwards

between us for quite a while.

Yeah, you storyboarded it, didn't you?

At one point, yeah.

I started and you took over

and then you edited it all
and then gave it back to me.

There are a few sequences
like that in the film

that went between us for a long while.

Yeah.

This was in it from very early on,

but the sequence that kind of
follows this was a very late edition,

probably in the last four weeks
of shoot actually.

Again, because we felt we needed
to have some more fun with the bunnies

before the story gets going.

I think it really...
Actually, this sequence coming up here

that you're talking about,
Nick, actually

had an extra, you know...
It helped in some ways, I think,

to show that their house
was overrun with rabbits.

So maybe it was fortuitous in the end,

even though at the time
again we were reluctant

to cram more in at the beginning.

I think for good reasons
too as well, you know,

because I think
it works beautiful in itself,

and I'm glad we put it in, but there
was a real risk of it seeming,

you know, an after-thought tacked on
and not quite in keeping with the movie.

It had a slight kind
of Warner Bros. Feel to it.

Yeah.

Neither of us probably
would have naturally done this,

but it kind of works.

But I think it's right to have that
instinct to be dubious, actually.

It's notjust about getting laughs early
on. It's about making a good movie.

This is one of the good jokes
in the film coming up.

Which was there from so early on.
Yeah.

You boarded it.

I remember
you drawing sketches of all this

being hammered through the trap door
when we started writing.

When we started, we spent
about a yearjust brainstorming it,

and we thought up most
of the visual jokes then, I think,

didn't we, in that first year?

We were constantly
writing towards the jokes.

We were just trying to find a way
to include all the gags.

Yeah.

The music here I think
is absolutely fantastic,

spine-tingling.

It was a very short piece of music

that was originally
with Lady Tottington,

coming up later in the movie,
as a kind of romantic theme.

And I think Hans suggested

that it could be used to represent
Gromit's love for his marrow as well,

and it's just
the most beautiful piece of music.

It was a difficult kind of score...

Oue, this bit, because it's
at home with Wallace and Gromit

and not getting too big and orchestral.

I mean, Julian's way is usually right

for that smallness of it all
and coziness.

And yet this is a movie,
and so it has to be sometimes big.

We didn't want
to underline every emotion,

you know, every sentiment, everything
that was being said with a music cue.

Yeah, not do the work
for the audience too much.

It's a very hard position
to be in as composer, I think,

how to play things and how
to complement what's going on visually

without trying to double it

or compete or overstate things.

Looking at the Mind-O-Matic here
and remembering that...

I remember when we decided
to include that in this breakfast scene

to introduce it for later on,
because for a long, long time

itjust came out of the blue,
you know, later in the movie

when Wallace
didn't know what to do with the rabbits

and he suddenly
received a package from Russia.

A brainwashing machine, ex-KGB,

and itjust came out of nowhere.

Wipe the snow off the top of it.
Yeah.

We used to have a whole sequence here
where he demonstrates it

and we cut out
about 30 seconds worth of stuff,

but it was felt that it was
doubling up too much when later,

when it actually is...
when it's actually used later.

So we lost quite a funny little sequence
of it kind of acting like a toilet

as he flushes his cheesy thoughts
back down into his head.

I feel the film here...
You suddenly get an inkling

that it's gonna be much bigger

than the the other mov...
the shorter films.

And you meet these kind of crazy,

upper-class characters,

fantastically voiced
by Helena and Ralph.

The whole kind of thing
suddenly branches out

and you have these new exteriors

and 'cause the characters have lips,
it's gonna get more sophisticated.

Just to make them posh, wasn't it?
Yeah.

She's amazing. I love Lady Tottington.

Helena so complemented her.

We watched so many movies that
had kind of posh ladies of the manor,

The Go-Between and different films.

Barry Lyndon, I remember... Kubrick.

I had such trouble
with this sequence here,

the arrival of Wallace and Gromit.

This got passed around a lot, didn't it?

It did. You worked
on this sequence for months,

probably years, I think,
and at some point...

I remember having Victor
singing to Lady Tottington with...

...a lute, playing romantic...

Kneeling and playing romantic songs
while having a picnic.

That's right, a whole picnic sequence
where he was offering her a ring

to get engaged and it was the ring
that got sucked into the burrow

by the BunVac
instead of his wig at one point.

Which I know I was keen on,
which would have been a huge mistake.

The wig was so much more fun.

The first appearance

of quite a bit of OGI
in the BunVac there.

With the bunnies.

Yeah, it was very impractical
to do that with clay bunnies, wasn't it?

Although you wanted...

You made sure
that the clay look was retained there.

I remember one of the animators,
Seamus Malone actually,

trying to animate
about 30 Plasticine bunnies

on cocktail sticks
to see if it could be done.

I think he tore his hair out.
It was never gonna work.

You even worked with the OGI guys

to keep a stop-frame kind of movement
quality there with the bunnies.

Yeah, there was a bit
of twitching around on the bunnies,

but it kind of ties it in.

MPO did a fantastic job.

It was a real clay bunny scanned
into the computer, wasn't it, Steve?

Yeah.

With fingerprints and everything
to keep the same look.

I love this little bit.

She's beautiful, Lady Tottington.
Yes, she is.

I remember we showed an early model

of Lady Tottington
to the whole team and everybody,

and I think people had real problems

that she was so odd,
you know, her hair was so giant.

And I remember we stood up
in front of all of them

and we said, "Well, we love her.
We think she's wonderful and funny."

And they kind of weren't
going for it for a while.

I think then when we married her
to Helena's voice,

she became so likeable.

Yes.
She's such a positive character.

I remember it being suggested
that we take

half an inch off her hair.

I remember not wanting
to take a single millimeter off.

Yeah.

You always had that idea
for her hair from really early on,

which is a "T," isn't it?

Yeah, she was there.
"T" for Tottington.

She reflected... We talked about how,
I remember at the beginning,

how she should reflect,
as a nature lover,

reflect the environment around her,
the trees and the clouds.

There's good verbal gags, a toupee.

That was a hard one to pull off
with the dialogue with Ralph,

to say "toupee,"
but to kind of make it sound

like he's asking "to pay,"
but so you know what it means.

Yeah.

Backwards and forwards a bit.

A lot of the jokes took a lot
of working on, didn't they?

This is classic,

one of the classic
moments in the film, I think.

I love how he spins round
and the rabbit stays in the same place

on his shiny bald head.
Yes, it's nicely done.

We had that idea very early on,
didn't we?

And you pulled that off really well.

Later on in the movie Wallace
gets a rabbit on his head as well.

Some kind of re-occurring theme there.

Yeah.

Fantastic animation
with Lady Tottington here

and that speech is just superb
I think, Jay Grace.

I love the way she kind of laughs
in that upper-class toff kind of way

because that really made her funny
as well as sympathetic.

Because that really made her funny
as well as sympathetic.

Gosh, and this sequence
was how to, I remember,

how to get Wallace infected,

you know,
to get him to be the Were-Rabbit

was probably one of the biggest hurdles
to overcome in the whole writing process

because, you know, traditionally...
You know,

we watched all these werewolf films,
didn't we, Nick,

you know, with...

You know...
Lon Ohaney, Jr.

Yeah.
Oliver Reed.

And of course they all get bitten
Hammer horror.

By a werewolf that already exists,

and their only release
from that is to be shot,

you know, by a silver bullet and killed.

But it had to be Wallace
that was gonna be the Were-Rabbit.

We always knew that.

But how to get him infected
and then, you know,

make it so that he could recover
was the most difficult thing.

And we didn't want it to be
kind of chemicals or bites.

Infections and things. It didn't
seem to go with clay animation,

to be bitten
and have any blood or anything.

We had to sort of
steer this one very carefully.

And really it's absolutely preposterous

and ridiculous what happens to him.

It doesn't really make a lot of sense,

but we thought it was funny that Wallace
tried to rehabilitate the rabbits,

and just by having
their minds merge together

it caused this kind of short circuit

of DNA or something technical.

Yeah. These bunnies are OGI,
aren't they?

Yeah, yeah.

That's one of the only jokes
that doesn't play outside the UK

is AY-UP! Magazine.

For obvious reasons.

Outside the northwest.

I remember the whole
Mind-O-Matic early on.

It was a completely different machine
as well, like some huge centrifuge

that spun around
and that was all boarded.

Even the maquette
was built when we realized

it had to be this thing
that went on his head.

That's right,
it had many forms, didn't it?

I remember, you know, racking my brains

because even though it has no logic
really, this crazy logic,

it had to kind of
have some kind of logic.

The rabbits were so popular,
weren't they, the little simple rabbits.

We worked so hard
to keep them very basic.

Yeah, yeah.

This is the beginning of a lovely
sequence, I think, in the movie.

I always... I say love,

and at the same time
find them so difficult,

those parts of movies where everything
is just absolutely wonderful

and tranquil and life's great and
you know it's all gonna go wrong.

It's a great part in the movie I think.

See this in the cinema,
everyone just goes...

Yeah, for Gromit.

I know, it's like gold, isn't it?
It's like really...

...wins people over
and it's just a vegetable.

Well, it's a dog.

A vegetable.
It's a very loving dog.

I always feel like this is where
the movie starts when I'm watching it

because this is where the story
starts to happen.

It always had a kind of
fairly slow build, didn't it,

from really early on in the script.

I mean, so far it's been set up,
I guess.

And now this is where
the inciting incident happens.

Starting to meet
all the other characters.

Yeah.

I used to...

I remember looking out the back door
as a kid at the moon

and having to go to bed.

Itjust has that very homely feel.

We put a rubber bone
in for Gromit there.

This, for me, is pure Wallace
and Gromit because it's...

You're seeing it
from the point of Gromit

and yet Gromit also lacks knowledge,

at this point, of what's going on.

And, plus, we're playing
a big red herring here.

Yes. Yeah, and that was...

Yes. Yeah, and that was...

That took a while
to evolve in the film, didn't it?

It did, yeah. It was taken out
completely at one point.

I love the vicar. He's great.
Yeah, I love him.

Nicholas Smith, perfect vicar.
Yeah.

Again this is, you know,
we so watched so many other...

We're such fans of all movies
and, you know, watching horror films,

there's always this bit

where you meet this character
who's not a main character

and you know he's gonna get attacked,
you just know he's had it.

And I think...

There's a werewolf film...

I always like thatjoke.

That's a very early joke.
It gets a good laugh.

That was one of our early jokes,
wasn't it?

Many visual jokes.

And the fog in the graveyard
was a challenge here

that we used throughout the film,
didn't we?

Yeah.

So the animation was shot
and the characters were removed

and the same camera move was done

but we'd actually
blasted smoke onto the set,

so it really is hanging over the sets
and the two were composited together

and we had extra OG smoke put on.

I always like thatjoke.

Was that Mark Burton's joke?
Very funny.

Mark was such a great addition.

He was a gag writer on Ohicken Run

and came in more as a, you know,

to help us out on the script
structure and dialogue on this one.

He's great at those
one-off gags as well.

I remember that sketch you did of that,
really early on with the cucumbers.

This scene was in from the beginning.
It was the first scene shot, I think.

I mean, whether it was completely
shot... Oh, and some of the launch.

This was one of the more
elaborate scenes shot early on

because it was always constant.

We had faith
that it wouldn't get cut out.

Yeah.

I think it's because you really
know where you are in the movie,

you know it's sending up
the whole horror genre.

It's a great idea,
the shape of the beast in the fog there.

I often find that gets a good laugh
as well, all the flashing eyes.

Yeah, yeah.
I never thought that would actually.

This bit, there was a lot of talk
of cutting this out.

Actually we did
and we put it back in,

whether Gromit should see
anything around the house.

And I think, in the end,
it gave a slight breathing space

after the town had been attacked.

And, actually,
what you can realize later on

is that it's actually Hutch
that's been out looking for cheese.

Yeah.

I just like the way with Gromit...
It's the start of a Gromit movie,

because he's suspicious of something.

Fantastic. Peter Kay
doing the voice of PO Mackintosh.

Fantastic. Peter Kay
doing the voice of PO Mackintosh.

This must have been
a nightmare to shoot.

This was... Yeah.

This was my difficult part.

The scene was always there, wasn't it?

It was, you know, like the scene
in Jaws when everyone gets together

and they have to decide
how to deal with this problem,

you know, from all sorts of...

Yeah, we watched Jaws, didn't we?

Titfield Thunderbolt.

Yeah, a big meeting
where everyone's at odds.

They make a decision

and then that moves
on the rest of the movie then.

A lot of these horror movies, like
Ealing comedies and what have you...

The Invisible Man has a
skeptical policeman like Peter Kay.

Where there's a town hall meeting.
They're always wrong.

Yeah.

And the vicar,
who's on a single-minded mission

to rid the world of evil
and seems to have all the knowledge.

I became so fond of all the characters,

all the other townspeople.

What was difficult in this scene,
we talked about it so much,

was keeping Wallace and Gromit
involved and I really do...

You know, I did realize as it went on,
that they were a little absent,

but it kind ofjust
gets away with it I think.

You allow them to be out of it

because of the gags and everything.

Yeah. Great gag, that.

One of the oldest, but one of...
It's an old joke.

But they're the best, aren't they?

I think there were something
like 50 or 60 characters

in this sequence
and, you know, throughout...

We were filming the sequence
on two or three sets simultaneously.

I think it took about a year
to do the sequence,

you know, with a couple
of animators every day.

So we were shooting it out of sequence

and all these characters
were constantly moving around

and so they had to have charts
of where they were

and where they were gonna be.

It was quite a thing
to keep tabs on them all.

Oh, yeah, continuity nightmare.

Never thought thatjoke with Phillip
and the angel worked very well.

It's OK though. I don't mind it.
It's punctuation.

I don't think people quite understand
where the angel's come from.

It's supposed to be loosened
by Victor's gunshot.

This always gets a good reaction,
the angel versus the devil.

I must admit I did doubt on that

when I saw it on storyboards,
that it was, you know,

it was OK to go along with,
but it really works a treat.

I think what this scene
just manages to pull off,

that all these people
are completely crazy actually.

Wallace and Gromit's world
is inhabited by people

that are equally as mad as them.

Yeah. It is actually the first time
we've met other people in their world,

actually, which was always an issue.

How that's gonna go down.

I love Gromit's reaction here,
just there when he nods to Wallace.

The old Wallace wave.
Yeah.

Oomes in very handy
at the end of the film.

I think the sequence is fantastic here
with the lady Were-Rabbit.

This was a difficult part
of the film to write, wasn't it?

It was. We went through different
versions of this actually, I remember.

The sequence where they
sat in their car drinking soup.

Yeah, and Victor sometimes was gonna
appear in this sequence, wasn't he?

To threaten them.

Oh, that's right, yeah.
It took a long time to land on this.

Once we'd got this
it seemed to come together.

The handy female Were-Rabbit costume

that we could then
use later in the movie.

Very much from The Pink Panther.
Peter Sellers.

We had many different ambitions
with that costume, didn't we,

and which all went out of the window.

Yeah, Wallace and Gromit had
this wicked neighbor, Mr. Wormald,

who was a vegetable
steroid enhancing cheat.

Oheat at vegetable growing.

And he ended up
in the costume at one point.

Gromit in the roof, that was originally
gonna happen in the garage door.

Of the house.

There was gonna be some struggle.

I think when Victor comes...
Later on.

...to shoot Wallace,
Gromit was gonna be struggling with him

and was kicked into
the aluminum garage door.

By the Were-Rabbit.
It made its way into the van.

Yeah. Gosh, we had so many
versions of this sequence.

It was often trying to serve
too many purposes in the story,

and then I remember when Mark came
in and we worked on it a lot together,

we sort of very slowly simplified it.

We had to pull off here that, you know,
Wallace had gone to get the costume,

but not kind of...

I hope the audience didn't
get suspicious, too suspicious,

you know, to begin to think
that the Were-Rabbit was Wallace.

I think it pulls it off well actually.

Yeah, I'm always wondering whether
this worked as well as I wanted it to,

you know, the ears remaining here.

I'm not sure people see that or not,
or whether the music cued it, but...

I always thought people
mightjump more at this bit.

They did at one point.
I'm not sure what happened.

Yeah.

Like in the test screenings we had,
people jumped more

than in the final version
and I'm really not sure.

I think it's subtle changes
in editing and the music.

I think it was right in the end.

This took a lot of editing.
Really exciting sequence.

The music is fantastic as well.

We had all sorts of bits in here
as well of him seeing the vicar...

Oh, boy.

We tried for ages
to put more gags in this bit.

I do sometimes wish there
was a better gag here or there, but...

Gosh, we shot quite a bit more
footage here on the end of each shot,

you know, trimmed every shot
by about 75 percent... probably.

It was hard for you, I know,
to keep the Were-Rabbit out of shot

without giving him away.
That was quite a policy that came in.

I always wish that this gag
was a bit funnier, just there.

We once had him sliding
into somebody's marrow

and it said "squash" next to it,

and I thought that was quite funny.

There's great tension here.

I love Gromit's eye-roll
just before he plummets into the abyss.

Oh, yeah, it was mad, this.

It was always too long, this sequence.

It took quite a bit of editing down.

All that mud is OGI is it, Nick?
Flying towards the camera?

The mud on the window is real,
but any mud in the air flying

with kind of blur-effect

is put on afterwards by MPO OGI guys.

This makes me laugh.

I like the change in tone
on the music there in the greenhouse.

Tranquility about to be disturbed.

It's funny, they're so worried
for their vegetables.

Yeah.

Sort of a OGI there
with the mud being kicked up, just here.

Fantastic.

I remember the van used to get...

In an earlier version
it got destroyed, didn't it?

It was just a chassis with a seat on it.

And the airbags still came out.

That's right,
we always had that gag, didn't we?

It's a great gag.

I remember here there was a shot
cut out. It was Gromit checking...

I wonder whether we
should have lost that really?

I kind of slightly miss it a little bit.

Director's cut?
Yeah, maybe.

Or the other director's cut.

One of the directors' cuts.

He looked back and checked his marrow
and it helped let you know where he was.

You know, it isn't here
or there really, I don't know.

It's interesting, I...

I suppose other people feel the same,
but I really don't suspect

that the Were-Rabbit's Wallace here
even though I know it full well.

You know it quite well.

I believe he's
just gone home in a temper

and it's quite a successful red herring.

This is Gromit the sleuth really,
isn't it?

Gromit... Gromit wondering...

I mean, the whole movie
revolves around Gromit.

It's Gromit's film here.

I remember, you know,
particularly myself doing sequences,

if I ever got into trouble...

...you know, keeping it on track,

I think the key
was to see what Gromit was doing,

and to make sure you were experiencing
the movie through his eyes.

Yeah, that was always the kind of
savior, wasn't it, to think like that.

The best notes were always:
Tell it from Gromit's point of view.

Sometimes it would only take
an extra couple of cutaways.

Yeah.

Good old bodily function.

I think that would have been
a very base bodily function joke

if it wasn't for Gromit wafting the air,

because that kind of helped it I think.

Gromit's so cute here.

This explanation of how the Were-Rabbit
occurs every night is a bit...

Exposition.

Shouldn't be listened to too intensely.

It comes across as a bit expositional,

but I think it's all right
because of the way it's done.

Also you're gonna find out very soon
that it's obviously a load of rubbish.

It's a complete red herring.

This reminds me
of Grand Day Out in some ways.

Yeah, 'cause that's obviously
not the Were-Rabbit, is it?

Something's wrong here.

I always wonder whether people catch
the word "botch" there on the rivet gun.

I've heard them saying it in the cinema.

Yeah?
Yeah.

It's amazing what people spot.

People always spot
the footprints there as well,

you know, over Gromit's shoulder.

Do they? I love the music round here.

For me, this is pure Wrong Trousers.

Film noir.

Yeah, it reminds me of Hitchcock.

I guess the stairs and, you know...

"Is it in the house as well?"
Is a slight thing in people's minds.

Yeah.

This is a great idea of yours, Nick,

of rabbit feet turning to human feet.

Fantastic.
Do you think people see that?

I don't know. I don't know. But I do.

That was the idea.

It was quite hard
to edit it to make it...

And this little bit here took a lot...

We both played around
with the edit of this bit

and with Greg and Dave, the editors.

Lady Tottington's
like toff on helium here.

Lady Tottington's
like toff on helium here.

She's completely bonkers.

I love her.

I remember thinking of things like
Silence of the Lambs here, you know,

when the murderer's gone round
to the victim's house.

Not quite as sinister.

And the sets of the interior of Lady
Tottington's house were amazing.

Fantastic.

I love the paintings of her ancestors.

Yeah, lots of background detail.

I always think that's hilarious.
But it doesn't get much of a reaction.

I don't know why. I'm not sure why.

What I like about Lady Tottington
is that you realize she's quite naughty.

She has a side to her, she's...

Which just gives her that extra edge.

She's notjust nice.

I mean, she is nice, but...

It's an important side
of her that, isn't it?

I think it's to do with nature loving,

and, you know, growing vegetables.

There's this fantastic,
heavenly conservatory.

The way you pull this off, Steve,

we had this vision for this
for a long time, didn't we?

This scene of rising
into the conservatory.

And Dave Riddett and I...
Dave, our DOP...

We looked at lots of postcards
and prints of Pre-Raphaelite paintings,

you know, with these women
in these fantastic silk dresses

kind of playing flutes
surrounded by plants

and the sunset behind them.

And I think Dave
so made it look like that,

the color scheme
and, you know, the puppets

and the set designs.

It also has a... It reminds me
of The Empire Strikes Back as well

and Oloud Oity.

I mean, a lot of the cinematography
and the lighting is, you know,

treated by, you know, our chief
cinematographers Dave Alex Riddett

and Tristan Oliver, as a serious movie.

It's real serious filmmaking.

It's not lit for kids or anything,
you know.

A very funny scene.

I remember I had a lot...

Storyboarding this,
I had to cut so much out as well.

I wanted, you know,
some of the slightly naughtierjokes,

and I think there
were more of them originally.

I think it was
my slight affectionate nod

towards Benny Hill and Oarry On.

You know, I realize now
how un-PO they are,

but at the time, as a kid,
I loved those films.

I think it's got about
the right balance, hasn't it?

And it's kind of naughty,
but it's all suggested.

Yeah. They do it so innocently
as well, I think, that...

Yeah.

I'm never sure that you quite
understand what's happening here, but...

Yeah. It's clear.

A lot of editing.

Yeah.

That water there was done with OGI,

That water there was done with OGI,

although Dan did a greatjob here
with the animation,

and tried to do it with using bits
of resin and gel on his hands.

We try as much as we can, don't we,
to keep everything in camera.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

The way this is all shot, you'll...

Tristan... Tristan's lighting
is great in this scene.

It was a good moment
to take the music out, I remember.

That was a really good choice,

'cause that was scored and we thought
it was greatjust to let them chat.

It really gave a... It's good.

It gave it a breathing space.

It also made you aware that
something bad was going to happen.

The gaps can be...
Yeah. Yeah.

...as poignant as the music
itself sometimes can't.

I think, for me, Nick, this is one
of my favorite sequences in the movie

that, you know,
you work so hard on, and...

Because it's almost like
the essence of the film, I think.

This is kind of... I sometimes feel
this is why we did the whole film,

for this sequence,
just for that transformation.

And I love it that the bully,
Victor, really gets...

You know, he's gonna beat him up,

but he's the one
who really gets the beating.

It's so rewarding.

It was great fun to do
and a lot of work.

And from the very earliest
horror movies, werewolf movies...

In The Hound of the Baskervilles,
with the, you know,

upper-class villain.
Yes. Yes.

That's one of my favorite jokes,
that one.

Gromit locking the door
cause he's all full of anticipation

and knowledge of...

You know what Gromit knows,

but you don't quite know
how it's gonna happen.

I always wish we hadn't seen
Wallace in that shot,

because I think it slightly takes away
from the mystery.

I think you're OK.

You just know you're in for fun here.

And that was the challenge, was...

'Oause we often had it as too horrific.

And it was like, how to keep it

at the same time
real genre on the horror movies,

but a real reference
to horror movie genre

and yet at the same time real comedy?

I think the music again is good
with that kind of barrel organ.

That almost burlesque fairground.

The temp music was often too dark.
Yeah.

Too heavy on the strings.
It felt like genuine horror.

Yeah. Yeah.

He's quite scary in some ways.
Yeah.

But that's great, you know.
Kids love it as well.

Yeah. I love thatjoke. David Bowers...

A very early joke that David Bowers,
storyboard artist, did.

And I'm so proud of lan's animation
on the Were-Rabbit here.

We really wanted him
to have that feeling

of a sort of Ray Harryhausen,

Willis O'Brien, furry monster.
Yeah. That's right.

A monster with a character.

We could have done it OGI,

but we couldn't have found the money
to do it 'cause it's so expensive.

We wanted it to have
that vintage King Kong quality.

I love this joke with the rabbits.

There's no reason for them to have...

Oompletely arbitrary joke.

I remember we talked also
about the Were-Rabbit,

that he's furry,

but somehow you can see
in his eyes that Wallace is inside,

trapped inside,
and I think that comes across.

Yeah. The bow tie helps too.
Yes.

I love this fantastic,

sort of melodramatic,

over-the-top reactions
with the lightning.

It's a big change in the movie here
'cause Victor knows now.

These were kind of two big scenes
in a way, apart from the conservatory?

Then you came...
After I finished on that scene,

then you came into your own here,
Yeah.

With Victor really coming out
in terms of his evil.

Yeah.
He comes into his own here.

The lighting is great as well here.

Yeah.

This sequence
just had to be filled with...

Well, you know, you had to get
into that mood of revelation.

Everything had to be a joke.

The lightning and the rain.

The performances are so serious
from Ralph and the vicar,

but it's just crazy.

It was so gothic. Kind of camp gothic.

This is where it really does
the horror movie genre again.

You know where you are
and it's pure spoof.

I love Nicholas Smith's performance.
He's so crazy.

Though you can't tell
what he's saying sometimes.

He's very good with Ralph
as well 'cause it's so...

Ralph's so straight and in a mood,

but he goes off on these crazy tangents.

It's great to hear Ralph
doing comedy actually.

Superb. Yeah.

I think this idea... I know
Dave Bowers boarded this early on,

but I think that idea
of the bullet thing came from Jeffrey.

Am I right in remembering?
"A bullet, a bullet, a bullet..."

Oh, yeah.
We were pitching it to Jeffrey

That's right.
And he kept...

That was yours?
Oheesiestjoke in the movie.

That was yours?
Oheesiestjoke in the movie.

Steve's joke, that.
But it works incredibly well.

It's like it had to have that
at the end when we hit on it.

And that's yours there, Nick.
That's right.

But there's always
that danger of it not coming off

'cause it's a sort of knowing
kind ofjoke to the audience.

But it really does work.

It's at times like that

that I feel there is a hint of Naked Gun

or Police Squad! In the movie.

Some of the jokes are so corny
and, of course, we know it,

but it's great
'cause everyone is in the film.

They're all taking things so seriously.

It's real drama playing out
and yet it's completely crazy.

They're having fun as well.

I really kind of enjoyed this scene,
actually.

The tension and the way
you're with Gromit.

It's nice for this kind of quiet bit
after all that activity.

It feels like you're getting
towards the end of the film.

You're on the home run towards the end.

And now it's about the characters.

It's about our main characters now.

Yeah.

It's got to go somewhere here,
hasn't it, the story.

That's great.

No apology for thatjoke.

It was one of the firstjokes
that we thought of.

I love the dialogue here,

which I think was, again,
was quite early on, actually.

I think it was in another place
originally in the script.

But the sense of what he's saying
was very similar for a long time.

I think we all wrote it, you know,
at one point, didn't we?

Yeah.

I love how stupid Wallace is.

And the music. The use of the
Wallace and Gromit theme is really good.

Yeah.

It's a scene between the two of them.

This is what makes it worthwhile,
you know.

There's that quirkiness
of the scene itself.

There's that quirkiness
of the scene itself.

You know, one character has ears
and completely in denial

of him being the Were-Rabbit.

And Gromit can't... He's a silent dog.

He can't find a way of explaining it.
It's a great dilemma.

A dramatic dilemma.

I really don't think people expect this,

you know, what's about
to happen here as well.

That's such a good reaction, you know.

OK, so he's the Were-Rabbit.
But what happened to Hutch?

I don't think people are quite ahead...

You know, they haven't
got that far in yet.

When he speaks,
it's such a great reaction.

At every point along the way
in every scene

we tried really hard to kind of
not do what people expect

and be a bit out... away from formula,

and be a constant quirky...

Oonstantly quirky
at every different story point.

Peter Sallis still.

Speeded up.
Just speeded up. Yeah.

He did all of Hutch, didn't he?

From here on until, you know,

you're getting towards the fairground
at the end, I find it so difficult.

This run of sequences
was so long to work out

and to get that bridge
to the final confrontation.

Yeah.

It's nice to get back into daylight

and into a more
lighter scene like this...

...that then takes this turn.

A very contentious line there,
the brassicas line.

Yes. I'm glad it stayed in, though.

Yeah. I am. I really am.
It's official, on record.

It was so, you know...

People so wanted us to take it out

and if you think about it
then it is a little bit risky maybe.

But it happens so quickly.

It's just part of the color of the film.

Yeah. Yeah. I think it's OK.

I think you do need it,
actually, in the scene.

We did cut it out
and it seemed to go too quickly.

Yeah.

And you need to know
what the villagers are thinking

for her to reach this conclusion
that she has to turn to Victor.

They have to pressure her
into this decision.

And it's a funny joke anyway.

Yeah.

Sometimes something's
gotta stay in 'cause it's funny.

This short sequence
was difficult as well.

I think it was almost a hangover
from earlier scripts,

but shooting this
was so late on in the process that...

...you know, it was hard
to find a better way through.

And I somehow feel we
should have used Hutch more here.

More use of him being like Wallace.
Right.

And yet the touching moment
is quite nice.

Yeah. No, it works well.

It's always difficult when you're
working with a scene that's an overhang,

that's got a lot of history to it,
and was once much bigger.

I think what was happening around
the time when we were filming this,

we were still working out the ending,

and at that time we always felt

that Wallace was gonna have to go back
into the Mind-O-Matic with Hutch

to reverse the experiment.

So we felt that we needed
to get this machine repaired.

Now what's happening
is that Wallace can't do it,

but because Hutch
is like Wallace, he can.

And so this was being shot

when that was
making its way out of the film.

Yeah, and it's a less important
story point now, isn't it?

It's just important that it starts
to get positive again

before it starts to get bad again.

There's a whole thing, I know, here,

that a film we don't often talk about
that we watched a lot was The Fly.

You know, that the...

The original version,
where the fly itself

is actually quite crucial
to putting things back to normal.

And there's a sequence
where the fly goes out the window

and it has the, you know,

that essence of the man in it that...

Lost his kind of alter ego
or whatever.

And Hutch was gonna
take on that role, actually,

very much in earlier scripts.

Hutch was gonna join this
George Formby Society band and leave.

They had to go and get him back.

Oan't even go there.

That was another story.
Yeah.

But it didn't kind of go that way.

No, no.

I love... I love the comedy,

you know, the basic
comedy set-up of this scene

of her...

...her coming to tell him
this terrible news

while him trying to cope
with turning into a Were-Rabbit

and trying to keep it a secret.
It's so difficult when that happens.

I can imagine.

And she's so... She's come round to say,
"Look, I really care for you, you know."

She really likes him

and he has to slam the door
in her face.

Yeah.

People really feel for her here.
Yeah.

Notice as she walks away,
everyone goes "aww" when she cries.

And we thought it would just be funny.

Yeah, yeah.

This is, I think, Mark's joke again.

The final rout. The final insult.

And the tears there were...

They took so long to get them
to look right,

and I'm still aware that they look
kind of slightly awkward.

But it was a real homage to
one of my favorite animated films.

I think one of yours as well, Nick,
The Big Snit, Richard Oondie.

And the sound of the tears
hitting the floor.

Oh, this was such hard work,
this sequence.

This area of the film was hard.
We went backwards and forwards.

We had much bigger sequences,

like the Space Hopper scene itself was...

When he jumps on the Space Hopper,
was enormous at one point.

It was a huge sequence.
Like the end of the film,

which is why we cut it.
Yeah.

I somehow feel like
I wish it had more energy here,

but... I don't know.

I like this bit.

Nice line.

I like the lighting.

Very bright colors here.
Striking yellow.

I think we were trying
to keep it colorful and rich

like a sort of Disney film.

The colors are lovely in the movie.

So, yeah, this would have been
the beginning of a huge chase.

This idea was always in, wasn't it?

From the beginning
this kind of... him, Wallace...

We thought it was funny,
Wallace starting to get romantic

with the decoy
that he made in the first place.

Yeah.

It doesn't bear thinking about too much.

Poor Lady Tottington.

I think you realize just how selfish
the townspeople are really.

Just happy to be rid of it.

And also I remember
you did that scene, Steven,

and you were asked to change
Mr. Growbag's flask of brandy

for a carrotjuice carton.
Yeah.

Which is ridiculous 'cause
you would never have spotted it.

It was just a hip flask.

That's a bit of subtle acting
from Victor here.

This took a lot of working
on this edit, didn't it?

This whole sequence, 'cause it's like
how does act two go into act three?

And it took a lot of work
to unfold it quite a bit, didn't we?

Yeah.

I remember, at one point, Gromit
believed Wallace was dead as well

and went home, sadly went home,

and went home, sadly went home,

to the tune of Bright Eyes.

And Hutch was there,

and discovered in a newspaper
that the beast was still at large.

This is the bestjoke in the movie.

And it was a contentious one.

I'm amazed how many people
spot the writing on the stall there.

Yeah.

"Oats 'n burgers."
That's right. There.

I love this joke.

Growbag's great.

We loved those, you know...

We loved ending the film
in the fairground and thinking...

Watching stuff like Strangers On a Train

at nighttime in the fairground.

The models and the props
are just stunning.

I think it's a good joke.
You pulled that one off well, Steve.

It's a good laugh.
You boarded this, didn't you?

This whole sequence went
back and forth between us a lot.

Yeah.

How to end the movie
is always the difficult bit.

I think this bridge
was particularly hard.

I never felt...
Sorry, I shouldn't ruin it.

I think it was OK.
I never felt this quite

felt as satisfying as it could be,
Gromit's escape.

And we'd actually shot some of Hutch
in the launch sequence

really early on, didn't we,
just to be economical...

That's true.
...while we were shooting.

Gromit was next to him, wasn't he?

He was and we OG'd him out,
rubbed him out.

I think, like,
so many things in the film, really,

they don't stand up
to a lot of scrutinizing

'cause, you know,
he just happens to go backwards.

It works though.
It gets him out the cage.

I think the way
you've edited it is really good.

It's like all of...

Particularly this whole area to the end,

I have so many mixed feelings
about, but no one...

You know what?
I haven't heard anyone complain.

I think only we see it
a lot of the time.

I always feel I can breathe
a sigh of relief, though,

because that little run of sequences
that I've done is over

and now it was up to you
to get it back on line again.

It's funny when you watch a film,
you know,

your heart beats a lot quicker
in the cinema

when it's stuff you've worked on.

It was in your hands now
to get it all going again.

Yeah. And it was always...

I mean, we sort of struggled for ages

on how to do this next whole bit,

'cause it's now how to end the film
in the most satisfying way,

and as usual we have too many ideas

and how to make them all work
together as a unified piece.

The music really helped do that,
I think, didn't it?

Julian and Hans' work there

and all the composing team.

Do you remember this sequence,
Nick, of Mrs. Mulch running away,

being chased by the barrow
was actually in part of the sequence

where Gromit was chasing the beast
earlier on in the film?

For a long time Mr. Mulch,
I think, was pushing the pram.

Oh, that's right.

As Gromit was being pulled underground,
they were being chased.

Yes.

Like a lot of things,
they move around, don't they?

We have an idea and it maybe
hasn't found the right place.

But here it helped to bring the beast
towards the vegetable stand.

Yeah. Yeah.

I know a lot of the editing of this
is kind of naughty animation directing.

But the animators, you know,

would do more footage
than you actually use

and you edit quite a bit out,

and use it almost like it's live-action

and just edit it around.

I mean, shots would change order
quite late on

as we were mixing the sound even.

Yeah, and this...

The whole golden carrot thing was...

I think it was because of that
24-caratjoke earlier on

that the carrot became a golden one.

Right.
And that suddenly clicked for us

that, you know, that would be
his final piece of ammunition.

It seemed so neat and tidy,
as if we'd thought it from day one.

But we hadn't at all, had we?

No.

I'm always amazed how much
the audience reacts here.

He's squashed his marrow.

I didn't know we'd built up
that amount of emotional attachment.

Because it's been for nothing as well.
It's sad, isn't it?

Yeah.

Merlin's bit
of Were-Rabbit animation here...

That rabbit broke three times
on that shot

and he would have to replace
the rabbit three times.

Three different rabbits.

I do feel proud of thatjoke,

but it had to be cut down quite a lot.

This was put together so quick,
this bit.

We were scrambling like crazy
at the end of the movie

in the last five weeks or something.

We shoot so much of the film towards
the end of the production, don't we?

Yeah, yeah.

Everybody pulls out the stops,

and shooting on 30 different sets
at the same time.

You know, with as many animators
and as many cameras rolling.

Now we're getting into that beast
climbing to the rooftops thing

that, you know, are in so many
monster movies as well.

King Kong and...

The Oliver Reed werewolf film,
he ends up on the rooftops.

That's right. They all do, don't they?

Most werewolf movies are pretty...

...not very interesting endings,
actually.

So we had the challenge

of how to make this funny
as well, and positive.

I love this bit.

Steve's bit in the greenhouse.

Back to the sanctuary of the greenhouse.
They had to go there, didn't they?

Yeah. These are all your bits
inside the greenhouse, aren't they?

I don't know if people
read that until she says it.

I think they do. Yeah. I think so.
Do they?

Yeah, I think
you can read it's Wallace.

And the dogfight was...

...was all on dodgems
once throughout the interior.

It was, wasn't it?
Yeah.

This was quite a challenge of how to...

This is like the beginning of the end.

And I have, you know,
I have heard one or two comments

that it feels too much of a set piece.

But I'm not sure really, you know.

I think it's...
I think we did the right thing.

I think, you know, with...

That's great. Oandy floss. Your gag.

I think, like with The Wrong Trousers,

it was, you know,
once he'd got to this stage...

Once you knew
what all the characters wanted,

they jumped on the train

and that was even heading
towards the end at breakneck speed.

But we had so many stories

to tie up here
before we could let it go.

You know, it was
quite a complex story in a way.

Their marriage,

you know,
her finding out that he knew,

and it was quite a lot of dialogue

and quite a lot
of wrapping up of story lines

before the chase could get going.

If anything I feel it holds back a bit,
but there wasn't much of a way of...

It was a nightmare. You were shooting
the stuff inside the conservatory.

I was shooting all the stuff outside,
all the chase-y bits,

and working the two together
into cutting. We were cutting...

We were editing it at the same time
as we were shooting.

It was great.
Ralph's fantastic at comedy.

He is.
Fantastic.

A very Olose Shave-y kind of moment
with Gromit in the plane.

Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

That was a good edit, though,

'cause we always had Victor
baring himself to the world

before the vicar's line.

At the last minute we changed it around.

The edit here was quite a challenge
'cause it was how to make the gags

be "by the way" kind of things
rather than the point of it.

And when you've seen
Tottington Hall before now,

there's no way that
it's anywhere near this big.

But we just don't care at all, do we?
We just make it as big as we want.

It's real Tom and Jerry.
I love that explosion.

The music does a really good job here
of keeping it going,

even though you're having to stop.

We lost an umbrella shot there.

I still wonder whether that
would've helped that or not.

It might have slowed it down.

Where all the characters
put up umbrellas after PO Mac's line.

Oh, and this gag.

This gag idea we had from the beginning.

Of course,
they were coin-operated planes.

We had to use that somehow,
and then we...

It was so hard to get the sequence
working that we took it out.

And then I think you said we've
got to try to get that back in again.

We were having a meeting,

one of these giant meetings with
40 people in, Jeffrey and everybody,

and there was a question

that itjust wasn't getting
as many laughs as it could.

And I think it was almost
like repeating the joke

with the organist in the church.

You know, what about
just completely stopping it?

But I remember saying it

and at the same time thinking
that's pretty risky to do.

But itjust seemed
to be exactly the thing.

We just had to do it.

And then we thought we got
to have the plane slowing

and, you know,
the search for coins between them.

And then Mark said,
"What if Phillip had a girl's purse?"

Then we all cracked up
and decided to do it.

Then it was a matter
of finding the right place for it.

I love this section here, Nick.

It's just beautiful, I think.

People say it's a bit Matrix,

but I wasn't sure I was really
thinking that, or either of us were.

Itjust seems so over-the-top again.

And it's moving, but comical.

The music is good.

I was trying to find a way to make
the moment as big as possible with this.

I know someone had a go

at speeding that up, that edit,

in this stage,
but it didn't work at all.

It didn't work, no.

And then we're back
into your scene here.

I thought that was a greatjoke,
that he landed on a table of crackers.

It was Dave Riddett's joke.

It seemed funny.

This sequence was...

And you boarded it originally,
lots of times, didn't you, Nick?

And then it was sort of a necessity.

I took it on,

and it was always very long.

It took so many things
to get over, and it...

And we'd shot it

and then had such
a radical go at the edit

which really
knocked it into shape, I think.

The chase-down sequence.

Yeah.

I know, it's like how to end the movie
as well. When does the movie end?

But I think it works.

But I think it works.

Without too many endings.

The rabbits, a good addition.

Again, the music is fantastic.

That alone brass band.

Playing the Wallace and Gromit theme.
It's really good.

This was actually an idea
from DreamWorks

to bring back the mind waves,

which I thought was a good, nice touch.

It makes no sense.

Why does he fall off the roof
and change back? We don't care.

I find it very moving, this scene.

You pulled it off well.
The dialogue was changed to...

That was shot with different dialogue
and then we re-voiced it

to get the idea
that the rabbit had gone,

but Wallace was there,
but there was no helping him

until we hear Hutch, you know,

and cheese is going to be
the kind of reviving answer.

And that shot was originally
much earlier in the sequence.

So the whole thing
was completely made in the edit room.

It was quite last minute.
It was very last minute.

I think it's good.
It really works well, that structure.

Wallace here, I think, as you may see
on the DVD extras,

originally was shot
with the rabbit ears, the fluffy ears,

from here to the end of this sequence,

because as I said earlier on,

there was always a plan
that they would go home.

I think Wallace
had this line where he said,

"Oome on, Gromit.
Better get home and changed."

They would go back to the Mind-O-Matic
and put things right.

But then, quite rightly so,

people felt that he should be...
This is a greatjoke...

That he should be cured here
so everything's OK.

And the good thing about that, actually,
was that Hutch can stay Hutch

and it would have been quite sad

to have not had Hutch
existing at the end of the film.

And it's good to feel that sense
of resolve here as well.

I know I was quite stubborn
about not wanting to change that,

but the things you go through.

I think we all are, aren't we,
about some different bits?

The rabbits...
I love the bunnies.

They're great.

Who animated Lady T there?

Suzy Fagan. She's good.
Nice bit.

And this. What to do here
in the last sequence was, you know...

We just had so many endings.
We did.

She was even at one point
gonna marry PO Mackintosh.

I think it... I remember again
I was keen on that.

But I think sometimes
these different ideas

are just like a catalyst to... You know,

'cause the wedding thing
is still in the air.

It's all part of getting there.
Yeah.

You have to believe in the wrong ideas

for a certain amount of time
and this seemed like the perfect thing.

And I know it was Dave Sproxton,
I think,

that brought this back into the mix,

and was probably the way we ended

the very first script we ever wrote.

That it ended up back at Tottington Hall
as a bunny sanctuary.

It resolves the actual story
we were telling, doesn't it,

rather than create a new...
a new thing.

It makes me fond of what I've seen
being back at Tottington Hall.

I remember the fun
of the earlier part of the movie

and I actually feel sad

that I won't see Lady Tottington
again at this point.

Yeah. This is the perfect ending
for Wallace and Gromit

'cause there was...

The other ending
had too much sadness for Wallace,

'cause you thought "Oh, no,
he hasn't married Lady Tottington."

And the perfect word to end the film.

"Oheese."

Yeah. I thought you meant "The End."

That's good as well. Two words.

And then we decided to use the...

As a... MPO, the guys who did
the OGI bunnies,

they had them in their computers.

So we decided to use them again
in the credit sequence.

I think we wish we'd had more time

and, you know, put more of them

doing more particular things.

But we... It was just, like,
in the last week of making the film.

They worked so hard and this is
the ultimate they could get together

for this sequence in the time they had.

It's quite a piece of work.

Yeah.

Very good.

We can talk about
all the people in the credits.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's... It was fun working on it.

Yeah. I think it's kind of...

From the beginning of writing it,
it was five years of work

and I know throughout
that amount of time

I just thought of nothing else,
it seemed, you know.

You know, we'd have...

The huge challenge
was writing the script

and I had no idea
it was going to be as complex...

I think it is a fairly complex story,

and I remember waking up
in the middle of the night

and writing things down.

It was kind of like
living it for five years.

I know. Like coming out of prison.
Yeah.

It does. It changes your life actually.

It does.
'Oause coming out this end of it

and going through eight weeks

of non-stop talking
about it around the world,

you come back,
like, out of the whole thing

like a changed person, you know.

Like a... I don't know.

You know, it's like an ambition
that's been fulfilled.

Yeah. It must be amazing for you, Nick,

'cause you must have always thought
of Wallace and Gromit as a feature film.

And not that the others
in their way weren't, but it's done now.

You can look back
at a Wallace and Gromit feature.

Yeah, yeah.
It must be quite a thing.

In a way, I'm so pleased that it's
had such critical acclaim in a way.

Not that that matters in itself,
but itjust shows...

'Oause you're working
in the dark for so long

with this just kind of blind belief
that it's going to work.

And then...

And you go through such
a lot of doubt in such a lot of it

that it's more relief that you've done
something right, you know.

And I think, you know,
I remember so early on

talking about it and saying

that itjust had to retain
that quality of the other films

and that was always
in jeopardy, I think.

You know, just putting it on
the big screen and being, you know...

Having more money,
having more people involved.

But we so wanted to make sure

that Wallace and Gromit fans
weren't disappointed as well.

You know, that it could
be a great, you know,

fantastic, huge, like, movie.

But we so didn't want
to alienate the original, core fans.

And to keep it...

To keep it kind of quirky
in its concept, basically.

It was in its initial concept,

but keep it absurd and quirky

at every different story point,
at every turning point,

so it never fell into, like,

off-the-shelf
kind of Hollywood scenes and...

So it always had
this odd Britishness about it.

Yeah.

And yet, at the same time,
we're always trying to do...

I found somehow you're always looking
for the obvious way to do your idea,

that you start off
in the most abstract ways

but you're constantly looking
for that route

that everyone's gonna get it
even if the idea is quirky.

Yeah.

It's like a real mixture of conforming,
but not conforming.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, I know.
It's the hardest thing, really,

'cause we were very strong

about what we felt about the whole film

and what...
the kind of story we wanted to tell.

And so many people come in,
and often their comments, you know...

Quite often people's comments
are very irritating a lot of the way

'cause they're constantly criticizing
every little thing that you're doing.

You're so grateful because
you're glad someone's had the courage

to tell you something isn't working
when it's not working.

I mean, I... Gosh.

It's my first feature film

and I find it so challenging

and, you know, often difficult
to be so heavily criticized.

But I can truthfully say that itjust
would not be as good as it is

if it weren't for people doing that.

Whether you agree with them...
I think often...

Often solutions are not right.

But they are hitting on something that's
probably a good reason to worry about.

And at the end of the day,
I think we've made,

I think, what is truly our own movie.

Definitely.

What an ending.
Perfect.
