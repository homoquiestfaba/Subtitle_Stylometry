[Ninea Voiceover] It's not easy running things alone.

A black woman in the 90s.

Young, smart.

Thugs always trying to get next to you.

They wanna ask me out.

(soft tense music)

I need protection everywhere I go.

There's always someone with me,

watching me, guarding me.

I grew up in southwest Philly.

When I was 17, my boyfriend took me to my first drug buy.

He gave me the gun,

said they wouldn't frisk me.

So, we sitting down, he checking out the shit.

All of a sudden, this fool come rushing out the hall,

trying to jam us up.


That turned out to be my first homicide.

I remember how I felt then,

hysterical, crying and screaming

as he dragged me out the spot.

I miss that feeling.

I wish I could go back.

Back to when I was soft and innocent.

We came up after that.

But eventually the cops caught him.

He left his fingerprints on the table.

I served one year for the drugs they found

when they served the warrant.

He pleaded guilty to homicide for me.

Said he felt responsible.

I really think he loved me.

He served nine months of a eight sentence in Rockview.

He was killed there a short time after.

When I got out, I went to the house we used

to live in to get our stash.

It was right where we left it.

It wasn't much, but it was enough

to get me on my feet, though.

For one year in prison, I barely talked

but I listened to everything that was said.

Every story that was told.

By the time I got out,

I was ready for the street.

I knew what I wanted to do

and I knew how to do it.

I did whatever it took to build a nice lay.

I even killed for it.


Now, don't get it twisted, I'm far from rich

and I used to know how to make myself happy.

If I learned one thing in this business,

it's once you get on top. (phone ringing)

The fight to stay up there

is just as difficult as what you did

to get there in the first place.

Yo.

(soft hip hop music)

(reggae rapping)

â™ª It's time to get paid â™ª

(reggae rapping)

â™ª Confiscating bread y'all â™ª

â™ª He grab the set â™ª

â™ª Pull yes in the yeyo â™ª

â™ª 'cause shots when I say so â™ª

â™ª First car in sight â™ª

â™ª Make 'em strip â™ª

â™ª Till his dick hanging â™ª

â™ª Cut his throat â™ª

â™ª Till his tongue swing â™ª

Wake that pussy up.

Oh damn.

(tense music)

Oh!

Don't play stupid with me, motherfucker.

about you jamming up one of my workers?

Ninea, it's just a little misunderstanding.

This is one mistake you're not gonna walk away from.

Fuck that.

[Sammy] Come on now.

We can straighten this out.

Uh uh.

[Sammy] We can straighten this out.

Come on now, I'll stay out of the way with it.

Oh you gonna stay out of it, all right.

Come on, Ninea.

We can work this out.

Just like I said, I'll stay out of your neighborhood.

[Ninea] Spare me the human emotions, nigga.

You asked for this shit.

You know what?

I know how the fuck you are.

So you know what, fuck you.

I don't give a fuck.

I'ma die anyway 'cause I know how stupid your ass is

and I know how your mind is

'cause you know just as crazy as I am

'cause if I get out of this shit,

So you better kill me now

and twice in the back as he answered his front door.

So the fuck what?

I don't read this shit.

Aint a school.

Man has been identified as 24 year old Pat Lewis.

Neighbors say they heard the shots

and ran to the door to find Lewis dead in the hallway

and a car speeding away.

Police say this mafia style hit

was the work of a professional.

Several neighbors reported hearing the shots

but could not shed any light

on who have committed this gruesome crime.

So what?

That was Penn, asshole.

Shit.

I aint know that motherfucker real name.

Get the fuck outta here.

Nigga, what the fuck is you doing?

Just take the fucking paper.

Nigga, I wanna see, too.

Fuck you, motherfucker.

Damn.

Ignorant ass reading over motherfucker's shoulders.

[Dion] Something like that.

He pissed of Ninea Ranks.

He was gonna testify against her in court.

So she had him killed.

Stupid motherfucker!

I told him to lay low.

Dummy.

Well, you know what this means, don't you?

We definitely gonna have to do something about this shit.

So this is what I want you two to do.

I want you to follow her, keep tabs on her.

Where she spends her money,

I'm getting tired of this shit.

This shit comes to a halt soon as possible.

You understand me?

And that's the way it is.

We need to get that motherfucker laid.

Oh that.

It's nothing for you to worry about.

Ninea, I told you a thousand times.

You're not my only client.

Now what you did, it jeopardized my whole career

and I don't like it.

Now don't me wrong, sister,

the money you pay me, it's good

but you cannot afford to buy me a new career.

[Woman] Hi, Julie.

Carla, hi.

The 16th, 10 am, my office.

The light cupcakes. - Okay.

Fucking your shit up was a chance I had to take.

I had to send Dion a message.

Now if you as good as you think you are,

that shouldn't be no thing, right?

Ninea, we had this case beat.

You can't just go around killing everybody.

The DA, they know who you are

and what you do.

And so do I.

(tense hip hop)

It's still early.

I'ma give you a minute to check the tone of your voice.

(tense hip hop)

(phone ringing)

Yeah?

What's in it for me?

I don't know, man.

All right, well I really can't talk right now.

I'm with my lawyer.

I'll swing by the crib later, aight?

All right, later.

(tense hip hop)

Look, I knew the case was beat

but I also knew that Dion was behind this whole thing

in the first place.

And like you said, I pay you good

How's the weather in Madrid?

Yeah, they've been asking about you.

All right, I'll tell 'em.

Been quiet.

No problems.

We did get a new girl, though.

Yeah, I don't know how she gonna work out yet.

We'll see.

When you get back, we'll put you on her.

All right.

Well what time your plane come in?

What gate?

All right, well I'll be there to pick you up.

Yeah.

All right.

I'll see you when you get here.

Later.

(soft hip hop)

So let me get this straight.

While I was out of town,

you called Ninea from jail?

No.

So how'd you get in touch with Ninea?

My brother called her for me.

So how'd your brother get Ninea's number?

[Woman] My brother know Durango.

So.

So let me get this straight.

Your brother called Ninea

to get you out of jail for what,

so you can put in some work?

Yeah, that's right.

Okay.

So um, what you know about drugs?

I used to sell for this girl on north side.

I got popped once.

I used to sell for her.

She was all that.

She was the only girl I know who was slinging.

All the other girls and shit,

they worked for men.

[Woman] So what happened to her?

Man.

She got, she got killed in a car accident.

Gotta love it.

So, what was you in jail for?

Me and my nigga was tearing it up.

I kicked his ass.

Word.

So, is that how you got that black eye?

(low tense music)

(tense music)

So what's up?

We got a problem.

We don't have a problem.

You seem to be the only one with a problem here.

Yeah well why don't you take your shit down south?

I heard the business is great down there.

Well if business so great down there,

why don't you take your bloated ass?

Dog, why you asking these stupid questions?

Ask her why she always wearing those fucked up wigs.

Well you aint going nowhere

and I aint go nowhere.

So what we gonna do about it?

Well, I don't know about you.

But I'm fitting to blast my way out this motherfucker.

(door creaking)

Hey, get up.

I wanna buy something.

(tense music)

Some other time.

â™ª I'm lighting up one â™ª

â™ª Then we heading to the crib â™ª

â™ª So we can tighten up some â™ª

Alright, so you got a little bit of heart.

So, you not worried about that nigga coming back for you?

Hey, T.

[T] What's up?

I finished doing what you wanted me to do.

You ate everything?

[Woman] Yeah, everything.

[T] Moneys on the table.

I'll give you a call later.

Bye.

(soft hip hop)

So, like I was saying.

You aint worried about that nigga coming after you?

Hell yeah I worry about him coming after my ass.

I mean, I know the first thing he do

right after he get out of the hospital

is come straight for me.

That's why I'm here for Ninea's protection.

Okay, well.

So let me tell you something.

I take care of all the girls here.

It's my job to make sure you doing your job.

You do what you're told,

we won't have any problems.

Now, all we sell is weight.

If I catch you on the cornering pimping dime bags,

there's your ass.

All right.

Can I ask you a question?

[T] What?

Is Ninea gay?

Why?

You got a problem with gay people?

I was just wondering because I haven't seen

no men up in here.

Only thing I see was women.

[T] No, Ninea is not gay.

She doesn't trust men, though.

Are you gay?

Why, you interested?

Uh.

[T] Well, anyway.

I have a favor to ask you.

I want you to snort a line of some blow right here.

Nah, that's all right.

I'm cool.

[T] Oh you cool?

I'm all right.

(tense music)

(woman gasping)

What you doing?

When I tell you to do something,

you fucking do it.

I run this fucking shit.

You do what I tell you to do when I say.

Or I will cut you up into fucking pieces

and throw you down the motherfucking sewer.

Now you snort that blow.

You hear me?

Snort the blow!

(woman coughing)

Oh god.

(bell tolling)

We don't know why he did it.

All we wanted to do was come in and question him, you know?

The guy said he had to pee.

He went to the bathroom and he blew his fucking brains out.

[Woman] What?

You mean to tell me he blew his brains out

while you two was still in the house?

Yeah.

Wow.

Do you know if he ever killed that girl or not?

We never got a chance to ask him.

Apparently someone tipped us off and led us to him.

Obviously, he was doing something that we didn't know about.

We tore the house apart

and we found nothing.

Guy did something

and he panicked and he blew his head off.

Wow.

This is so fucking bizarre.

I don't think I can live in your world.

You two got preps blowing their brains out

just because they're under suspicion.

Hey, you should of been there when we told the captain.

I thought his head was gonna fucking explode.

I gotta go.

By y'all.

Look.

What?

Shooting star.

What?

Ninea.

Ranks?

Yeah.

â™ª Where were you last night â™ª

(tires screeching)

(siren wailing)

(soft R&B music)

Oh shit, Ninea.

It's the 5-0.

Man go over to that shopping center

and stash the gun.

(soft R&B music)

â™ª Where were you last night â™ª

â™ª Where were you last night â™ª

â™ª It was all just a dream to me â™ª

â™ª Where were you â™ª

Ninea Ranks.

[Ninea] I want my lawyer.

What?

I haven't even asked you a goddamn question yet.

[Ninea] I know but you will

and I want my lawyer.

Just relax, Ninea.

Stop acting like one of the fucking Ramseys

and get out of the car.

So, it's been awhile.

How was your vacation?

[Cop] You got identification?

Would you like to have another one?

Hands behind your back.

Let's see.

Been three years since I was on the narcotics squad.

I remember arresting your mother

with an eight ball.

Stay right here.

And speaking of law abiding citizens,

how is your dear old lady?

She's dead.

Damn.

And she was a fucking contribution

to your sad ass environment.

Look, I got somewhere to be at.

Oh I know.

I know.

You gotta, you know, keep your little bitches

in check, right?

Look.

I play pokers with the boys in Vice.

You take care of me and I guarantee

that you won't have to spend another time in jail.

[Ninea] What about your partner?

He knows the rules.

He knows how to play the game.

So, do we have a deal or what?

Yeah.

That's good.

Well, you know what.

I think you need to hibernate for today.

I'm sick of looking at ya.

Bitch.

(soft tense music)

Yo man, why your face all twisted the fuck up?

Yo, Penn, what the fuck you keep looking over here for

before I blast your fucking ass.

Better pay attention to this shit man,

Fuck the motherfuckers.

Yo, man, let me ask you a question.

I don't know.

And one thing, them bitches don't be where we be at.

But that's just it, yo.

They don't be on the fucking corner.

How the fuck do they be making they money?

Keisha.

Come here, come here for a minute.

Let me rap at you for a minute.

I'm saying, what I can't get a fucking minute?

Go away, go away.

Fucking chicken head, man.

Yo man, she must be selling weight, though.

Yo, wouldn't it be funny

if Dion bought his stash through Ninea

from two different people?

That shit would be fucked up.

You know that would be funny.

That means Dion basically working for Ninea.


Like Lawrence.

Speaking of Dion, our boss,

How the fuck did he get to be our boss, yo?

Man stop asking stupid ass fucking questions.

Dean, fuck Dion. - You know what though?

You know what though,

But he aint fucking tell it to me like that.

He made it seem like he handled that shit

like a fucking man.

And you telling me this, he bitched the fuck out.

What the fuck, what the fuck is up with that shit?

Nigga.

I'm saying, so now what?

Nigga, if he handle his shit,

But, nigga.

If Dion aint got no mob connections,

we aint got nothing to worry about, baby.

All right, okay, now what if he do?

What if he got some fucking mob connections?

You want them fucking mob Corleone motherfuckers

running around chasing you?

Man, look, let me tell you something, man.

Running from the cops is one thing.

I can handle that shit.

But fucking, yo, man I'm human, man.

Heard you got smoked.

Back in my area.

Nah, I'm still here.

Looking good.

I mean.

Not to disrespect you in front of my brother's grave

and all that, I'm just saying,

you look like you've been taking care of yourself.

How you been?

It was a little rough when I first got out.

I'm straight now.

That's good.

That's good.

Damn, I miss my brother, man.

You never did find out who did it, did you?

Nah, nah.

Prison said it was drug related.

(somber music)

At least that's what the papers say.

That's some fucking bullshit, man.

I hear that.

It was nice seeing you again.

But I gotta go.

Ninea.

Ninea, wait.

Why don't you give me your number

so we can hook up later on.

Nah, that's a bad idea.

I'm not the same person you knew.

I'm not the same person neither.

It's just that right now, I got a lot

of drama happening in my life.

Just being around me is bad for your health.

Aight.

Whatever.

Ninea, everything all right?

Well if it wasn't, you'd be a little late right now,

wouldn't you?

I was up all night with that Jimmy thing.

(phone ringing)

Hello.

[Razor] Hey.

Who's this?

[Razor] Razor.

How the fuck you get my number?

Look, don't worry about how I got your fucking number.

Look, that beef you had with Dion,

that shit don't exist no more, I took care of that.

And what?

You called me just to brag.

Look, bitch.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry I don't mean to disrespect you.

But look, now that Dion no longer in the picture,

I'm saying we squash this beef and come together

and work together, you know what I'm saying?

Lock this city down.

So what's up?

Oh, I get it.

If I'm not with you I'm against you, right?

Yeah.

Hello?

Hello?

Ninea?

You used to like talking to me back in the day.

It's not your fault.

It was his time, Ninea.

Fucking bitch.

That fucking bitch hung up on me.

What happened, bro.

What happened, what happened?

She call you?

What she say?

What she say?

That bitch hung up the phone.

I don't believe that shit.

It's time to send this bitch a fucking message, man.

What the fuck she say?

Fuck.

Man, you aight?

What the fuck she say?

[Razor] Come on man, let's go.

(door creaking)

(tense music)

Look.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

My girls fellas don't need no man power.

I really don't want you here

but Razor got 'em all nervous and what not.

So you have to prove yourself to me.

Really?

You ready to get a little blood on your hands?

Whatever.

Come on.

(tense music)

You see this little hussy right here?

Yeah.

She stole $200 worth of my product.

Word?

And she's been down here two days.

Till I find out what I'm gonna do with her.

She only 14.

And her mommy left her with her step daddy

and he likes to play daddy.

So brother, you'd be doing her a favor.

Ah, look at her.

She's so scared.

Heart beating like thunder.

(tense music)

Fully loaded.

Kill her.

What about the noise?

Don't worry about the noise,

you just point and shoot when I tell you to.

(tense music)

Shoot.

(gun clicking empty)

What's up with the gun?

No firing pin.

How am I supposed to bust a cap

without a firing pin?

You don't.

Look, if you...

My girls are off limit to you, okay?

Call me tomorrow.

On Saturday.

What's up with your girl?

She pissed off.

We had a $200 bet.

She bet that you wouldn't do it.

You were gonna shoot me, weren't you?

Business.

Sure is a feisty one, aint she.

(tense music)


Come on, you want some more?


(tense dramatic music)

(somber music)

(somber music)

[T Voiceover] I take care of the girls here.

(somber music)

I got you something.

(echoing indistinct voiceovers)


(somber music)

So what you wanna do?

I'm gonna kill that motherfucker,

that's what I'm gonna do.

I don't think you should do that.

I think you should wait things out.

Look, I don't,

I don't pay you to think.

I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

Hold on, hold on.

Catch the next elevator.

Back up, man.

Come on, Ninea.

Let's think things out.

I'm gonna kill him.

I done thought about it.

What is there, what?

What, then what?

Kill one of theirs, they kill one of ours

and then what?

Just keep going back and forth?

Then everybody's got to die, okay?

Oh now everybody's got to die?

Everybody gotta die.

Whoever don't want to die

just don't be there.

Listen, I don't want to tell you how to run your shit,

Ninea, but, it aint gonna work out that way.

(somber music)

[Man Voiceover] You know when I got back

from the hospital,

you know how I sound when those fuckers tore me up.
