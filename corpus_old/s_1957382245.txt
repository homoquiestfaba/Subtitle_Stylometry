I totally forgot to tell you this.
I was watching Katie sleep earlier on.

I did that thing
where I fast forward into the future

and I can see
who she's become and whatnot.

And I did it, and it was incredible.
She's a podiatrist.

Our child's a podiatrist?

In Cleveland. Doing really well.
Third biggest in her firm.

She drives a Lexus. Like,
four years old, but it's pretty good.

I... I always thought she'd be like
a... a... a butcher.

A butcher?
[woman] Mm-hmm. A butcher.

A v... a vegan butcher.

You know, so she'd take carrots
and carve little rib eyes,

or her pork chops
that'd really be made from cauliflower.

[both chuckle]

Do you think that we should
put a bird up there?

Uh, birds are tricky.

with them.

[baby crying]
Hello.

Aw! Look who's awake.
Did you have a lovely little nap,Â Katie?

[Katie coos]
Did you?

Would you like to inspect your wall?
[Katie babbles]

Ta-da!
[man] Pretty good.

[Katie coos]

She can tell I'm not a painter.
She's so smart. Mama's little butcher.

Who's daddy's little podiatrist?
[woman] Or mama's little butcher.

Yeah, that's you.

[Katie babbling]
Yeah, it is.

Okay, there.

I can drive to the Superstore

Lilly?


Oh!

Mrs. Oberhoffer.
Those will rot your teeth.

Only if you eat 'em by the dozen.

[Lilly chuckles nervously]

You go inventory something.
Okay.

How's everything, dear?

Everything's good.

How are things with Jack?

He's just great. Yeah. I...
Thanks for asking.

I'll be sure
to tell him that you said hello.

I was talking to the pastor.

And we would like to come over for a visit

and talk with you.

I cannot imagineÂ what you've beenÂ through.

[man on intercom]Â <i>Lilly to

People have been noticing
you're acting sort of funny.

What do you mean, "funny"?

You know,

with that thing, all that's goin'Â on.
You're distracted.

I'm not distracted.

Sweet tiny Jesus.

What the hell is that? Gum selfie?

Everyone is distracted.

Nobody works.
[Lilly] Okay, Travis.

You know that I have to go
to thatÂ meeting in Rosewood tonight.

So maybe we can just pick...
Again?

Well, that's...

It's every Tuesday.
It's gonna be at least once a week.

So...
You see?

That's what I'm talking about.
You're my right-hand man, Lilly.

But your mind's not in the game.

What good's a pro ball QB
without a left tackle?

Ah.
Who's gonna pick up the blitz?

I don't really follow football,Â so...

Well...

get with it.

Okay.


Bubblegum or otherwise. Okay?

We've talked about this.

Yep.

Every week. I'll buzz you in.

[door buzzes]
[door opening]

[indistinct chatter]
Hello.

Hi, everyone.
It's so great to see you tonight.

Hey.
How are you?

[woman] Hi, baby.
I'm doing great.

Yeah?

Yeah.
You look good.

Let's take our seats.

I believe we left off last time

talking about emotional triggers.

Does anyone have any thoughts
or questions about that?

No?
[sucking]


You know me.
I'm a sucker to peer pressure.

[inhales sharply]

Yeah, but you hate thoseÂ things.

[sighs]
They've got all these flavors now.

So, tonight I'd like to talk about trust.

Lilly, let's start with you and Jack.

Okay, sure.

Some families have a hard timeÂ adjusting

after they've been apart
for an extended time.

Seeing how things
are going to be different.

I don't think
that's gonna be aÂ problem for us.

I... I can see that would be
for someÂ people, but...


changes are scary,
but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Scary? We're not...

We're not scared. Right? I mean,Â that's...

[woman] They scared. They scared.
She's fine.

Of course I'm fine. You're fine too.

Is that true, Jack?

Let's just move on, shall we?
Lot of people to get to.

It's just that we...

we haven't actually
talked about it, but I mean, I...

We haven't. I mean...
I mean, look.

If you wanna talk about it,
let's talk about it. By all means.

Great. We should do that. Talk about it.

Let's talk about something
other than vaping.

What's next week? Meth?
[group groaning]

[woman] Really?
Not appropriate.Â Not appropriate, Lilly.

It's just, it's a joke.Â I don't mean that.

Never mind that. She has turned
my only son against me. What about that?

Mother, you know I haven't...

I am not your mother!
Can we talk about something else?

You know, I saw her on TV
with that Dr. Phil.

Velma.
Scheming to have him tie my tubes.

Mama, calm down.
Mother.

I am not your mother!
Velma.

Velma, sit down.
[Velma] Don't you talk to me!

Why do you keep telling me to beÂ calm?
I am calm!

[contemporary music playing]

Lilly.

Lilly!
[Lilly] Ugh.

You got a sec?

Yeah.
[therapist] That didn't go so well.


I don't know. I think Velma
made some real progress tonight.

I deserve that one.

Not what you call a ringing endorsement
for psychiatric care.

[breathes deeply]

How's he doing?

Really?

It's gonna take some time, Lilly.
He's been through a lot.

Yeah. Well, that's the way it looks.

Are youÂ getting back to a normal routine?

Have you done anything
with Katie's things?

What does that have to do withÂ anything?
Emotional triggers like that areÂ tough.

Are you saying
I should get rid of her things?

No. I... I don't know.

How would that make you feel?

I think it's getting late,
and I should get a move on.

Lilly, when you come here...
[sighs]

...do you get anything
out of it for yourself?

Yes, yes, but let's...
let's keep the focus on Jack.

We're doing that.
But are youÂ seeing anyone?

I see people all the time.
I see you right now.


You have to do the work too.

Okay. Well, great.

[door slams loudly]

[engine starting]

to work with that lives down your way.

A therapist.

Maybe you could give him a call.


Like <i>The Three Stooges?</i>

He's a good guy, Lilly.

Someone you could talk to.

Sure thing, Regina.

You know, it'd be nice to see someone,
Lilly, before you have to see someone.

Yeah. Well, I'll see you nextÂ week.

I get this 24 hours a day.

I want his marbles knocked off.

their marblesÂ knocked off, I presume.

Uh, I'm as advertised.

Did you have a question
about an animal or what?

Well, uh, no, I don't.

I... I had gotten a referral for you
from a gal.

A gal?

Regina Miller?

Is she still with the state?

Uh, she's at New Horizons.

Oh.

Oh.

Well, I have taken up enough of your time,

Come.

He doesn't mind.
Don't understand why Regina didÂ that.

I've been out of the mental health field.
I left it ten years ago.

To become a vet?

[Dr. Larry] Mm-hmm.
Isn't that kind of weird?

It's an easy explanation really,
but, uh, let's leave it at weird.

What were you doing at, uh, NewÂ Horizons?

Well, I wasn't. I mean, I was,

but my husband is, you know, there.

Is he getting better?
[Lilly] I guess.

He says he's fine.
Well, that's good.

What about you?
Me? Oh, I'm fine too.

Regina sent you to see me
because you're fine.

Well, it wasn't my idea. [chuckles]

But you're here.
[Lilly] Yeah.

I, uh...

You know,
she said it might help him a little

if I did some work, so...

I also... I also kind of traded in
some of my furniture,

most of my furniture,
for a pleather La-Z-Boy.

Um,

I mean, not all of it, but...

My daughter, our baby, died.

Just over a year ago now, so...

SIDS, that's what they told us.

That's awful.

My husband Jack didn't handle itÂ so good.

[Dr. Larry] And you did?

No. No, I...

No, I'm...

It's a good question.

[Dr. Larry] Okay, well...


I just don't do
this sort of thing anymore.

Well, no offense,
but you can kind of tell.

[Dr. Larry] Maybe Regina can set you up
with someone else.

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay.

Are you familiar with stage three
of the grieving process?

I'm assuming that follows stage two?

Not, uh, necessarily.

But generally.

Uh, it's "bargaining and anger."

Nobody ever talked to you about this?

Nope. What comes after that?

Depression.

Great. I can't wait.

Mmm, you might not have to wait tooÂ long.

Oh no, we talk all the time.

Tends to be a one-sidedÂ conversation
but fine with me.


How's Jack doing?

Good. I guess.
Well, I have to seeÂ him tomorrow.

You have to?

Well, it's Tuesday.
Tuesday nightsÂ are, uh, family night.

So that's what I mean.
I have to go see him 'cause family night.

Don't you want to?
Well, yeah. He's my husband.

[Dr. Larry] Mmm.
I leave work every week early

just so I can be there on time.

But I think I'dÂ go nuts

if I was shut up in that place 24/7, but,

he doesn't seem to mind.


So was it Jack's idea
to be admittedÂ to the hospital?


Sort of?

Is this how it works?
How what works?

This.
[Dr. Larry] Oh, you think...

No, no, no. If we were doing that,
I'd just say,

"Sorry our time is up.Â Take this pill."

Anyway, we're just talking.

You know, sometimes we push people away
just to see if they'll come back.

Yeah?

Maybe it'll be better this time.

You think?

Maybe.

You sure it wasn't a blue jay?

I... I stitched up a cat once
who'd gone a few rounds with a blue jay.

Very aggressive avian, that.

Don't think it was a blue jay.
Oh. What's that?

That's a hawk.
No. It wasn't a hawk.

I know what a hawk is.

You know, they used to be dinosaurs.
Mmm.

Birds did.
Yeah.

You probably knew that
because you're a vet.

I knew that even before I was aÂ vet.

Very territorial.

You won't be able to scare him
away easily. He's too smart for that.

Smart?
Oh, they're brilliant.

They're, uh... [chuckles]
extraordinary mimics.

Mozart had one as a pet.

And, uh, they found in his notebooks

a melody from one of his concertos
that he wrote out, and nextÂ to it,

the melody as the bird sang it,

identical,
except for one or two sharpsÂ or flats.

Yeah. He was, uh, inconsolable
when the bird died.

Even gave it a funeral.

There's an idea.

[Dr. Larry] Two weeks prior to that,

Mozart did not attend
his ownÂ father's funeral.

Apparently, his father was anÂ asshole.

[starling tweets]

[muzak playing]



Yeah, well, here are the traps.

This is really more for a coyote.

I can't sell you this one.
It's illegal... You have a license?

No.

I could rent it to you

if you gotÂ it back to me first thing.

Oh, no. This is just for a little bird.
Oh. Well, you could trap it with this.

But you better release it inÂ Mexico,
or it's just gonna find its way back.

It seems very high.
It's not.

It's my business.

I will tell you this.

Lady came in last month.

Glass eye. Bird attacked her.

Oh my God.
I think it was a sparrow.

[whispering] You serious?
Extremely aggressive.

Never feel a thing.


It's a plague.

[whimsical music playing]



Or a cute little bear cub.

Or, like, a baby koala.

It's a bird feeder. It's tiny.
Nothing's going to get inside of it.

And you know there's no koalas
in North America, right?

Oh yeah. That's true.

I saw a possum shimmy up
a hummingbird water feeder thing one time,

a super skinny one.

I mean, it was bent like a palm tree
in a tropical storm.

Okay. Well, that's not gonna happen here.

Probably not, yeah.

It could, though. You know?

Animals will do anything for a snack.
And sugar water...

Have you tried sugar water?
No, Dickey.

I have not tried hummingbird sugarÂ water.

It's really sweet.

Any animal would go
to great lengths to taste it.

Yeah, it's not sugar water. It's seed.


Mixed with poison seed.

and take it down.

I'll clock you out at 5:00.

[gentle music playing]



[somber music playing]



I'm sorry.

You didn't deserve this.

[psychiatrist] <i>How are you sleeping?</i>
[Jack]<i> Fine.</i>

Are you eating okay?
Fine. Yeah.

Are you feeling depressed?
Okay. We don't have to go through this.

We don't... [chuckles]

So you're ready to leave?
[breathes deeply]

Believe me,

if I thought I could, I would.

Even if it meant pretending.

I already tried to do that.

And I ended up here. So what am I...

What am I supposed to...
I'm just supposed to go back to work?

Do you know what I do for a living?
You know what my job is?

Yes. You are a teacher.

I'm a grade school art teacher.

So...

So you go
and look at those kids every day.

You try doing that.

And what about your wife?
I'm sure she'd like to have youÂ home.

[breathes deeply]

You know, a few years back,


I joined this Frisbee league.

I don't know.

[nostalgic music playing]

And Lilly, my wife,

she felt left out,

so she insisted that
she become our sole cheerleader.

Just to be clear, Frisbee leagues
do not have cheerleaders,

or indeed, spectators.

But there she'd be with her pom-poms.

I'd make out like I was this jock.

this letterman jacket.

And we... [inhales]

It was so dumb.

I don't know how to get back there.

I can't be

who I was for her.

So, what is your plan?

[inhales deeply]

I just need a minute
to figure outÂ what happens next.

So, if you could just...


...write down whatever
you need to write down.


We can...

Can we do that?Â WeÂ just...

It's okay then? [sighs]

It's okay for meÂ to stay?

I believe that's what's best forÂ now.

[whimsical music playing]



[squawking]
[Lilly] Oh!



Where are you? Where'd you go?


Oh. Yeah.

[squawks]
Didn't expect that, did ya?

Look, can we just

kind of clearÂ the air, you know,
for the record that I...

I know what you're thinking.
That I killed her...

Remediated that bird, but...

I mean, I put that... [scoffs]
Forget it. It doesn't matter why.

I put it out. You know why I put itÂ out.

It was really wrong. It was...

bad.

And I shouldn't have done it.

I'm dealing with some pretty heavy shit
right now if you couldn't tell.


'Cause everybody's rolling along,
living their lives like nothing happened,

you know? And I'm saying, "Stop."
'Cause I wanna get off for a little bit.

I mean, it's just...
[tweets]

me talking to you.

Huh?

And you're actually

listening.


Oh, there you go.


Right. Well, good session.

It's my co-pay. [chuckles]

[Dr. Larry] Here you go.

The, uh,Â Naugahyde stains.

Yeah. Thanks.

[Dr. Larry] How did you find me?

Only one "L Fine. DVM" in the directory.

It's a dope rapper name if youÂ ever...
I don't rap.

I just thought a walk would do me good.

In the rain?

How did your visit go last week?
Great. Swimmingly.

Well, that's good. Thanks forÂ coming by.
It's late. I'm gonna go to bed.

I don't know what you want me toÂ say.


This whole thing,

it... it's not about Katie.

You'll talk about her, you know?

It's about Jack and you. Jack and you.

How do you restart?
How do you have a marriage, now?

Why... Why was Jack admitted
to the hospital?

He, um...

He... He was...


[somber music playing]

[door closing]

[music intensifying]

<i>Yeah, he just wanted to go to sleep</i>

and not wake up.

Like Katie.

You must've been pretty angry.

I wasn't angry.

No, he was depressed.

He... He had every reason to be.

So did you,
and you didn't try toÂ end your life

and leave your husband behind.

Alone.

You blame yourself.

Who's to say anybody's to blame?

I do.
Oh, that's shitty, Larry.

Not 'cause it's right or wrong, or good
or bad, but because that's what we do.

We can't stand the idea ofÂ something
so tragic happening for no reason at all.

So... You know, and...
and emotions have to find a way out,

and they always do.
So we kick the cat, or we kick theÂ dog,

or poison a bird.

And worst of all,

we turn on ourselves.

[thunder rumbling]

[gentle music playing]

Does Jack know how you feel?

Bathroom's down the hall to the left.

Talk to him, Lilly.

[screeches]
Come on. [whistles]




You know, is it helping?

Uh...

Yeah.

Yeah, I... I guess.

I thought maybe
we could go upÂ to the lake again,

when you get home.
You know, for theÂ Fourth.

Sure. Yeah.
That's fun, right?

Yeah, it'll be just like it was,
like nothing ever happened.

I didn't say that.

No, I know.
I...

No, but that is why I'm here,
isn't it? I'm...

I'm supposed to just go back
to being my good old self,

and we can all get on with ourÂ lives.

It's just gonna take time, that'sÂ all.
[Jack] Don't, don't, don't. Please.

I mean... You really think

that time is gonna make all ofÂ this okay?
It's gonna make us okay?

I'm not saying that. I'm justÂ saying
that we can't stay here like this.

This is not good.
I know.

But I don't know how I fitÂ anymore.

I don't know how we fit,

how any of it works. [chuckles]

I... I'm... I'm just not like you, Lilly.

You're not like me?

I carried her inside me for nineÂ months.

So why are you here?

Why did I sleep in that morning?
Don't do that!

I could've just gone over
and woken her up.

I could've done something.

But I overslept.

Every morning, when I wake up,
the first thing I hear is our baby crying.

And in that brief moment,

I get to imagine that I just wakeÂ up.

Like I always did.

That precious moment of agony,

it's the highlight of my day.

So please, don't talk to me about time,

because I've got loads of it,Â Lilly.

And I hate it. It never ends.

[whispering] Honey, please.
I wish IÂ knew how to stop.

[sighs]
I wish. I don't.


I got rid of all her things.

[Lilly breathes deeply]

I didn't know what to do.

I just kept staring at her closedÂ door.

I got rid of all of her things.

I just couldn't.

I just wanted...
You should go, I think.

I'm sorry, I...
[Jack] No, I think...

I don't know why I did it. I...

I should've asked you.

Jack?


Jack!

[in Spanish] Poor thing.
She's not doing well.

Maybe it's in the wrong aisle.

[lively piano music playing]

[telephone rings]

[door opening]

Lilly.

They wouldn't buzz me in. I was starting
to think something was wrong. Is he okay?

Why don't we sit down?

Is he okay?
[Regina] Yeah.

He's good.Â Fine.Â It's just that, um...

Why don't we sit down?
I don't want to. I wanna talk to Jack.

Actually, he's requested to not see
any visitors for a while.

I'm not a v... visitor. I'm his wife.

It's not unusual
for a patientÂ to want some space.

Space? Uh, I drive an hour
both ways to get here.

That's all the space he gets.
Legally, he has the right.

Legally, I don't give a shit.
Lilly, please, sit down. That's it.

Fine! God! There!
It's all better now that we'reÂ seated.

Did you look up
that old colleague of mine?

Yes. And maybe you could've mentioned
that he also treats poodles.

He'd never tell you this,

but Larry was on track to run
the whole show at Johns Hopkins.

Yeah, but he didn't, did he?

So he's a quitter like everybodyÂ else.

When do you think
I will be ableÂ to see Jack?

I don't know.

That's up to Jack.

You know what?

Here. Give him that.

I drove an hour. That's what I do.

For us.

And you don't wanna see me.

You think I like driving an hourÂ here
and an hour back?

Yeah?

[bag clatters loudly]
[breathes heavily]

I get it.

I mean, you want your space.

You want space? I'll give youÂ space.
I'll give you an-hour-both-waysÂ space.

[breathes deeply]

about what I did, did you?

Not once!

Not even once!

I feel shit too, Jack!


You don't wanna see me?
You know what? I don't wanna see you!

I don't wanna see you either!

Did you ever once think about that,
that I don't wanna see you?

Get another visitor!

I mean it.

Okay, I will tell him.
Hey. Hey, you hear that?

Hey, hey, no more nachos.

No more corn bread. Huh?

No more corn dogs.
And no more Cheetos. [crying]

Don't look at me like that.
Why are you looking at me?

Your mom really isn't here?
She's coming back to get me later.

Yeah, well, let's wait for her, okay?

I know what you're gonna say.
She gets tired all the time.

My brother says she's getting skinny too.

See, it's, uh...


She's in a lot of pain,

and theÂ quality of her life is...
is... is going to...

I'm talking about the quality of her life.
I'm talking about the quality of life

to a ten-year-old.

I told you. She signed off on it.
She's coming back later.

Okay?
[boy] It's not her fault.

She's not good with these things.

[inhales deeply]

Are you sure there's nothing?

I'm sure.

It's okay.


[telephone ringing]

[door locks]

You've got to stop
with theÂ just-showing-up business.

I need a favor, Larry.

He won't see me,
and they won't even let me talk to him.

Well, that's within his rights.
So I hear.

But I... I... I was thinking that
you couldÂ call Regina or someone.

Doesn't work that way.

But you know how it does work,
and you must have some...

some kind of credentials still, right?

This isn't the best time, Lilly.
Well, no shit, Larry.

I've been scratched off the guestÂ list
in a mental hospital by my own husband.

[drawer slams loudly]
Here's what you do.

Go and talk to Fawn
and make an appointment.

Make an appointment?

Aren't you supposed to be helpingÂ me?
Isn't that what this is?

Non-therapy therapy,

pretend therapy, whatever?
Isn't that what we've been doing?

What, am I on this island all alone?
I'm not a therapist anymore.

And I am certainly not your therapist.

You got that right.

Because you're a shit one.

Maybe that's why you quit.

I mean, what is it that makes

this so much better, huh?

'Cause wha... Is it 'cause
cats don't talk back?


[Dr. Larry] No, they don't.
They do, however, make appointments.

[taps table]

What do you want from me? [stuttering]

You... You want some kind of answer?

You want me to say
everything's gonna be okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, Larry. I...

Answers are good. People wantÂ answers.

I don't have the answers.

I never did. I just talked.

And the moment I figured that out,
I quit and stopped pretending.

You think you can fix Jack?
You think that's the solution?

What am I supposed to do?

I'm supposed to quit?

Like him?

Or like you?

At least quitting is an activeÂ choice.

Why don't we quit?

I'm so sorry.
I never should've started this.

It's my fault.

Let's just agree
to not do thisÂ anymore, okay?

Sure thing, Larry.

I'm depressed. That's why I'mÂ here.



Um, my little girl passed away.

And then I tried to pass myselfÂ away.


That's not funny.
But that is what I tried to do.

And I thought it was because ofÂ Katie.
Uh, that was my...

That is my daughter's name. Katie.

But if I'm being honest withÂ myself,

I have been in and out of this state
since I was in my 20s.

And I don't know how to get out of it.

I, um...

I've been to therapists.
I've taken the medication.

And sometimes, it works.
It does feelÂ a bit better.

And then after a while,

I quit.

Because I don't need that shit.

I can deal with my own life.


Quit on myself so fast.

And then I quit on the people whoÂ love me.

I mean, my wife. [chuckles]

[imitating Borat] "My wife."


My wife wouldn't know how to quit.

Wouldn't know where to start.

She just keeps at it.

Just keeps hoping and believing

and moving around in the world.
And I hate her for it.

[inspirational music playing]

And I love her so much for it
at the same time.

So much that...

I wanna not quit with her.

Not <i>for</i> her.


I wanna not quit with her.


Yeah, so that's my day.

Um...

a happy day.


[Velma sighs]

Jack.


Tissue.

I know.

[crying]
Thanks for sharing, Jack.

Might as well take him home. There's
no point in staying here all night.

What do I do?

Uh, just try to get a couple drops of this

into his throat
every couple of hours if you can.

Will he wake up?

[crickets chirping]

It's hard to say.

What's on his wings?
They're bound so he can't flyÂ away.

You know, even if he does wake up,
I... I might still have to...


If the wound doesn't heal,
he won't be able to protect himself.

It wouldn't be fair to send himÂ out there...

[breathes deeply] ...like this on his own.

Huh.

Funny how that works.

How what works?

Oh, just the idea of this little guy
trying to survive

out there in the cruel world
all by himself.

[inhales deeply]

Starlings are different than otherÂ birds.

When they mate,
they... they build a nest together,

and they protect the nest.

Together.

They even feed the hatchlings together.

They're just not meantÂ toÂ exist
in the world alone,

on their own.

Real subtle stuff, Larry.

[Larry chuckles] I thought so.

[joyful classical music playing]


Okay.

Maybe just a little.


You know you like this.

[Dickey cawing]


I read that if you talk toÂ somebody
in a coma, it can help them heal faster.

[music becomes louder and intensifies]


Come on. Come on.

[cell phone ringing]

[switches off music]

Hello?

[Jack breathing heavily]

[inhales sharply]
[Lilly] <i>I'm a little busy here, Jack,</i>

<i>so I don't really have time toÂ listen
to you breathe.</i>

You know thatÂ you're not the only one
in pain, right?

I mean, ever since Katie left us,
it's been...

And then you did what you did.

Which is not okay, Jack.

<i>I've been holding down
the fort for a year and...</i>

I haven't had five minutes

to think about my own feelings.

We never seem to
get around to that, right?

<i>Which is pretty fucking selfish,
isn't it, Jack?</i>

<i>So when you get back, shit's gonnaÂ change.</i>

Things are gonna be said,

tears are gonna be shed,

and then we're gonna move on and move up.

And we're gonna find a different

but even better life than the oneÂ we had

because I am not interested
in some kind of lateral move.

[soft classical music playing]

And you're gonna say sorry
to me for trying to take you fromÂ me.

You're gonna say it every day. [sniffles]

You're gonna say it every day
for theÂ rest of our lives.

That's gonna be a very long, long time.
[chuckles, sniffles]

<i>'Cause we're gonna live a long life, Jack.</i>

<i>And we're gonna do it together.</i>

[inhales deeply]

So I'm gonna hang up on you now,
because that'd make us even-steven...


Besides, I've gotta go feed...


[line disconnects]
[sighs]

[laughing]
[music becomes louder and more emotive]


[breathes deeply]



You're married, right? I mean,
I'm assuming you're married.


At least? I don't know.

Are birds monogamous?




I don't know how that works.


Here's your tube.

Come on. Come on.

[joyful classical music playing]

Excellent, Sarah. Watch yourÂ fingers.

Oh! Looks like the picture. Very nice.


Velma, what do we have here?

See? You got the switch.

[art therapist] Uh-huh.
It goes right in there.

You turn it on, and it stays up.

[both laugh]

[laughing] Yes! Up!
[laughing] Ooh, it's, yes, creative.

[Velma laughs]

[art therapist clears throat]

I think, um,

you forgot something?

The hole? For the...
Oh! Yeah.


Can I just leave it?

How would it work?

Does it have to work?

No, I guess not.

It's lovely.

Thank you.

Good-lookin' tree.

[psychiatrist] How are you sleeping?
[Jack] Fine.


[Jack] You are a creature of habit.
So you're feeling good.

Yes, I am.

But what if I stop feeling good?
What if it doesn't last?

That's a possibility.

Can I just say I found our timeÂ together
fairly unhelpful overall?

But you've made progress.

I have.

I just don't know
if it was because of you. [chuckles]


There will be good days
and thereÂ will be bad days, Jack.

Gonna miss these gems.

Living is predictable in that way.

Embrace routine.

It's good for you.

Ah yeah, the routine of living.

Make dinner, go to bed,Â wake up,

make your bed, kiss your wife.

But eventually, you'll go back to work.
You'll be around children again.

Maybe you can start planting
in your garden.

And one day,

you will say your daughter's name
without thinking about it.

It will just slip out

in remembrance and not in anguish.

And that'll be that.

[sentimental music playing]

That was actually pretty good.
Thank you.

Maybe there's hope for you yet.

[nostalgic music playing]


[leaves rustling]
[birds chirping]

[starling chirping]


[Lilly whispering] Wow, hello.

Don't, don't, don't, don't do that.


[starling chirps]



It's okay.

[whistles]
[whispering] There we go. [chuckles]

[chuckles softly]

I'm not afraid of you.

You're very small.


My helmet is very close too.


I'm gonna take you outside.

[starling chirping]


I think he was wrong about you.

Maybe I was too.


[joyful music playing]

[triumphant music playing]

Okay. Come on. Fly, fly.
[chittering]



Come on, fly. Please go.

Go, go, go, go!

Fly, fly, fly, come on, fly!

Fly! There you go!

There you go, you son of a bitch!
[chirps]

[triumphant music intensifies]

[starling squawks]


Phew.

that we have a new recliner?


It smells like, a little like beef jerky.

that's a smell I generally like.

[Lilly chuckles]

[soothing music playing]
[Lilly sniffles]

You know, I was thinking, uh,

a sectional sofa would work inÂ that room.

Where?

In the window nook, facing in.

Where Katie used to play.

That'll work.

Oh, shit. I, uh,

I made you something.

Oh, it's lovely.


[chuckling] Does it have a purpose?
Yes. It's a light switch cover.

Oh, well,

there's no hole for the switch.

Does it need a hole to work?

Well, yeah. I mean, you...

you gotta have a hole for theÂ switch,
or you can't turn the light on or off.

And then what?


I'm sorry.

Well, we'll figure it out.
No, no. I'm...

[Jack breathes deeply]
I'm so sorry about it all.

You deserve better.
It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.


I presume that...

this makes up for everything.

[Lilly laughs]


We'll cut a hole in it.

That's smart.

That's smart.

Just cut a hole in it.

Otherwise, you're really...
you're forcing a choice

of being in constant darkness
or constant light.

And that's just nuts.

I mean, no offense.
No, that's fair.

[both chuckle]
