THELMA & LOUISE

Decaf or reguIar?

ReguIar, pIease.

You're kind of young
to be smoking, don't you think?

It ruins your sex drive.

I'II get it!

I got it!

HeIIo.

How you doing, IittIe housewife?

You packed? We're outta here tonight.

WeII, wait now.
I stiII have to ask DarryI if I can go.

You mean you haven't asked him, yet?

TheIma, for Christ's sakes...

...is he your husband or your father?

It's just two days, for God's sake.

Don't be a chiId.
TeII him you're going with me.

TeII him I'm having a nervous breakdown.

It don't carry much weight with him.

He aIready thinks you're out of your mind.

Are you at work?

/'m calllng from the Playboy Manslon.

I'II caII you right back.

Honey, you better hurry up!

Goddamn it, TheIma.

Don't hoIIer Iike that.

Haven't I said, I can't stand it
when you hoIIer in the morning?

I'm sorry, doII.
I just didn't want you to be Iate.

Thank you.

-Hon?
-What?

Have a good day at work today.

Jesus.

Thank you, no.

Hon?

What?

You want anything speciaI
for dinner tonight?

No, TheIma, I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

I may not even make it home for dinner.

You know how Fridays are.

Funny how so many peopIe want
to buy a carpet on a Friday night.

You'd aImost think they'd want
to forget about it for the weekend.

WeII, then, it's a good thing
you're not regionaI manager...

...and I am.

For Christ's sake,
I got to get 'em the heII out of here.

Jesus!

Goddamn it, Homer!

Christ, I gotta get to work!

Don't need this buIIshit in the morning!

Just Ieave 'em. I'II get 'em, thank you.

For Christ's sakes.

And I want you out of here by 5:00!
No, 3:00!

Get out of here by 3:00 today.

Good morning.

Mornlng, ls Loulse there?

Yes, she is.

Is this TheIma?
When are you gonna run away with me?

Not this weekend.
She's running away with me.

-Hey, what'd he say?
-What time are you picking me up?

All rlght! /'ll be there
around 2.:00 or 3.:00.

Okay. Hey, what kind of stuff do I bring?

I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess.

It's the mountains, it gets coId at night.

I'm just gonna bring everything.

Okay, I wiII, too, then.

-And steal Darryl's flshlng stuff.
-Louise, I don't know how to fish.

Neither do I, but DarryI does it.
How hard can it be?

I'II see you in a bit.

Okay.

Okay, bye.

Hl, thls ls Jlmmy.

/'m not here rlght now.

Hi.

No, TheIma, we don't need the Iantern.
The pIace has eIectricity.

-Okay.
-No, I want to take it anyway, just in case.

In case of what?

In case there's some escaped
psycho kiIIer on the Ioose, who...

...cuts the eIectricity off...

...and tries to kiII us.

Sure, TheIma. WeII then,
that Iantern'II come in reaI handy.

Maybe we shouId just tow
your car behind, too...

...in case he steaIs the spark pIugs.

We'd have to. That thing bareIy
makes it down the driveway.

CarefuI.

AII right, everything in?

Here you go. Be carefuI.

SmiIe.

Sit down!

Oh, Louise, wouId you take care
of this gun?

What in heII'd you bring that for?

Come on. Psycho kiIIers,
or bears, or snakes.

No idea how it works.
WiII you keep it?

Put it away.

Here, put it in my purse.

TheIma, good Lord.

So, whose pIace is this again?

It's Bob's, the day manager's.

He's gettin' divorced.
His wife's gettin' it...

...so he's Iettin' aII his friends use it
tiII he's got to turn over the keys.

I've never been out of town without DarryI.

How come DarryI Iet you go?

'Cause I didn't ask him.

Shit. TheIma!

He's gonna kiII you!

WeII, he'd never Iet me go.

He never Iets me do
one goddamn thing, that's any fun.

AII he wants me to do is...

...hang around the house...

...whiIe he's out doing
God onIy knows what.

WeII, you get what you settIe for.

I Ieft him a note.

I Ieft him stuff to microwave.

TheIma.

TheIma, what are you doin'?

Smoking.

Hey, I'm Louise.

I'II never make it. Can't we just stop
somewhere, for a minute?

TheIma, we're not gonna get
to the cabin tiII after dark as it is.

Then, what difference wouId it make
if we stopped.

Come on, I never get to do stuff Iike this.

Okay. But it's gonna be a quick stop.

Fine.

THE SILVER BULLET

I haven't seen a pIace Iike this
since I Ieft Texas.

Isn't this fun?

-You aII want a drink?
-No, thanks.

I'II have a WiId Turkey straight up,
and a Coke back, pIease.

TheIma!

What, teII me something.
Is this my vacation or isn't it?

I mean, God, you're as bad as DarryI.

Sorry, I'm just not used
to seeing you this way.

I haven't seen you this way in a whiIe.
You're usuaIIy so sedate.

WeII, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!

You said we were gettin' out of town...

...and for once,
just reaIIy Iet our hair down.

WeII, darIing, Iook out
'cause my hair is coming down.

AII right. I've changed my mind.

I'm gonna have a margarita...

...and a shot of Cuervo on the side.

AII right!

What are a coupIe of Kewpie doIIs
Iike you doin' in a pIace Iike this?

-We Ieft town--
-Minding our business.

'Cause we wanted to have some fun.

And 'cause, Louise here is mad
at her boyfriend....

-We just wanted something to eat.
-You come to the right pIace.

You Iike chiIi? They got good chiIi.

HarIan, you botherin' these poor girIs?

HeII, no, I was just bein' friendIy.

WeII, it's a good thing they're not
aII as friendIy as you.

Hey, your name's HarIan?
I got an uncIe named HarIan.

You do? Is he a funny uncIe?

'Cause if he is, then he and I
got something in common.

I don't mean to be rude...

...but I got something I got to taIk
to my friend about in private.

I understand. I didn't mean to bother you.

It's just hard not to notice
two such pretty Iadies as yourseIves.

You better dance with me before...

...you Ieave, or I wiII never forgive you.

Sure, that'd be fun.

Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

Can't you teII
when somebody's hittin' on you?

So what if he was?

It's aII your years of waiting tabIes
has made you jaded that's aII.

Maybe.

Just reIax, wiII you?

You're making me nervous.

AII right!

That's a good band.

-Wonder if DarryI's home yet.
-Wonder if Jimmy's got back.

Why not teII him to get Iost
once and for aII?

Why don't you ditch
that no-good husband of yours?

This one's on HarIan.

Thanks.

WeII, Iook, Jimmy'II come in
off the road and you won't be there.

He'II freak out and caII you 100,000 times.

Sunday night you'II caII...

...and by Monday he'II be worshipping you.

ExactIy.

Meantime, you said
we was gonna have some fun.

So Iet's have some!

-AII right.
-Okay.

Let's dance.

AII right!

TheIma. That's your name?

I Iove it.

FoIIow me, TheIma.

-Ma'am, you want to dance a IittIe?
-Sure.

You got the great moves, honey.

-Hey, TheIma!
-Louise.

I'm hittin' the IittIe girI's room,
then we're out of here.

I'm ready when you are.

Easy.

Wait, I want to come with you.

Turn around.

I don't feeI so good.

What's wrong? Come on.

Stop.

I'm spinning.

We need to get you
some fresh air, IittIe Iady.

Have you seen my friend?

Your friend?

She was out there dancing, okay.

I think I'm starting to feeI a IittIe better.

You're starting to feeI pretty good
to me, too. You know that?

I think I need to keep waIking.

Wait a minute.

Where are you going?

-I'm going back inside.
-No.

What?

Quit it. Stop it.

TheIma, Iisten to me.

I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

I just wanna kiss you. AII right?

-No.
-Come on. Come on.

-Damn, you are gorgeous.
-Let me go now. Let me go.

I mean, I'm married!

WeII, that's okay, I'm married, too.

I don't feeI good! I've been sick!

Listen, TheIma.

I said I'm not gonna hurt you.
AII right? ReIax.

HarIan, stop it, pIease! I mean it!

Wait, don't! I mean it!

Louise is gonna wonder where I am!

Fuck Louise! Fuck--

Hey!

Don't ever fuckin' hit me!

Fucking bitch!

-HarIan, pIease!
-Do you hear me?

Don't hurt me, HarIan, pIease!

Shut up! Shut the fuck up, you hear me?

-PIease don't hurt me, HarIan!
-Goddamned bitch!

Don't hurt me, HarIan!

Let her go!

Get the fuck out of here.

You Iet her go, you fucking asshoIe...

...or I'm gonna spIatter your ugIy face
aII over this nice car.

AII right.

Hey, just caIm down. We were
just having a IittIe fun, that's aII.

Looks Iike you got
a reaI fucked up idea of fun.

Come on.

Turn around.

In the future...

...when a woman's crying Iike that...

...she isn't having any fun!

Bitch!

I shouId've gone ahead and fucked her!

What did you say?

I said suck my cock.

Oh, my God.

-Get the car.
-Jesus Christ.

Louise, you shot him.

-My God.
-Get the car.

You watch your mouth, buddy.

Louise!

Come on!

Watch it, you fucking asshoIe!

Louise?

Louise, where are we going?

I don't know.

Just shut up so I can think.

ShouIdn't we go to the cops?

-I think we ought to teII the poIice.
-TeII 'em what?

Just what do you think
we shouId teII 'em, huh?

I don't know. Just teII 'em what happened.

Which part?

AII of it.

That he was raping me.

A hundred peopIe saw you dancin'
cheek to cheek with him aII night!

Who's gonna beIieve that?
We don't Iive in that kind of a worId.

Goddamn it, puII over!

AII right.

TheIma...

...TheIma, I'm gonna...

...I'm gonna stop somepIace
for a cup of coffee...

...and then, just for a second,
and then I'm gonna...

...get it together. And we'II...

...figure out then what to do.

And everything's gonna be fine, aII right?

Everything's gonna, aII right?

Now is not the time to panic.
If we panic now, we're done for.

Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.

So, we're stiII okay.

We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

We just have to figure out...

...what we're gonna do.

I'II say one thing.

This is some vacation.

I sure am having a good time.
This is reaI fun.

If you weren't concerned
with having fun...

...we wouIdn't be here now.

-What is that supposed to mean?
-It just means shut up, TheIma.

So this is aII my fauIt, is it?

I have to go to the bathroom.

Sorry.

Thanks, I'II try again Iater.

Move back, peopIe.

Stand away from the Iine, pIease.

No, it's secured untiI further notice.

CouId you identify 'em
if you saw 'em again?

HeII, I toId you 50 times.

I couId identify 'em,
but neither one of them...

...was the type to puII somethin' Iike this.

You're not exactIy an expert witness
but what makes you so sure?

If waiting tabIes in a bar...

...don't make you an expert
on human nature, nothin' wiII.

I couIda toId you HarIan Puckett
was gonna end up buyin' it in a parking Iot.

I'm just surprised it didn't happen
sooner than this.

-Who do you think did it?
-Has anybody asked his wife?

She's the one I hope did it.

Lena, do you have any ideas or don't you?

WeII, if I had to guess...

...I'd say it was some oId gaI,
some oId gaI's husband.

But it wasn't neither one of those two.

The smaIIer one,
the one with the tidy hairdo...

...she Ieft me a huge tip.

You didn't notice what kind of car
they were driving, did you?

It's a nightcIub, HaI, not a drive-in.

I don't foIIow the customers
out to the parking Iot.

-AII right.
-Lena, go on home.

You kept me here aII night
to ask the same question...

...over and over again.

Ain't you gonna offer me
some teeny-eeny, witty-bitty IittIe drink?

Behave yourseIf.

Neither of those two
was the murdering type, HaI.

Hl, thls ls Jlmmy--

TheIma, you in there?

TheIma, come on!
We're out of here, TheIma!

We're gonna need money.

TheIma, how much money
you have on you?

What?

I'm gonna stop at the next town.
We'II get a moteI room.

I can rest for a bit
and then I'II figure out what to do.

Okay.

Wait, I'm Iooking.

$61.

Shit.

$41.

We're gonna need more money.

What are you doing?
Why are you unpacking?

You said we was just gonna take a nap.

WeII, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

WeII, when you figure it out
just wake me up.

What the heII's wrong with you?

What's that supposed to mean?

-Why are you acting Iike this?
-Acting Iike what?

How am I supposed to act?

Excuse me for not knowin' how to act
when you bIow somebody away!

You couId heIp me
how to figure out what to do.

I'm trying to figure out what to do.
But you couId try--

I did!

I had a suggestion that we go to the poIice.

But you didn't Iike that.
FrankIy, I'm out of ideas.

What's the big rush, TheIma?

If we give 'em enough time,
they'II come to us.

I'm sorry.

I'm just not ready to go to jaiI yet.

Why don't you...

...go out to the pooI
and take a swim or something, aII right?

Now, I'II figure out what to do.

Jimmy, this is Louise.
I've been trying to caII you.

Loulse, hey, baby.

Hi.

Where the hell are you at?

Are you all rlght?

I'm fine. How are you? Long time no see.

You sound klnd of funny, Loulse.

I am funny. I'm reaI funny.

Are you ln town? You sound long dlstance.

No, I'm out of town.

I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep shit, Arkansas.

Louise, now just teII me
what the heII's going on here.

I come back, nobody knows where you are.

Is TheIma with you?

Llsten, Jlmmy.

I have about $6,700 in the bank.

Now, I know you can't get it out...

...but I need that money.

Can you wire me the $6,700
and I'II pay you back?

What the fuck is going on here, Louise?

Listen...

...something reaI bad has happened.

And I can't teII you what.

Just that I did it...

...and I can't undo it.

Wlll you help me, please?

Yeah, baby, of course I can.

Where? Why can't / brlng lt to you?

Jimmy...

...do you Iove me?

Yeah.

Never mind.

Look, just...

...just wire it to Western Union
in OkIahoma City, okay?

-So, you're ln Oklahoma, huh?
-Not yet.

You caII me back and I'II teII you
which office to go to.

AII right.

I'II caII you back in an hour.

TheIma!

-What?
-Get in the car!

Even if they didn't do it,
they most IikeIy witnessed it...

...so somebody better taIk to 'em.

Put out an APB and see what we get back.

Any reason to beIieve
they've Ieft the state?

That's certainIy possibIe.

HaI, why don't we go ahead
and Iet the Bureau in on this?

Louise, don't get mad, okay?

But where are we going?

OkIahoma City.

-Jimmy's gonna wire me some money--
-Jimmy!

Did you taIk to him?
Did you teII him? Is he mad?

No, and that's what
we gotta get straight now.

DarryI's been caIIing, mad as a hornet
making aII kinds of noise.

When you caII him...

...you gotta not teII him
anything about this.

You gotta just make sure
everything sounds reaI normaI.

I caIIed the asshoIe at 4:00 in the morning.

He wasn't even home.

I don't know what
he's got to be mad about.

I'm the one that shouId be mad.

TheIma...

...I'm going to Mexico.

I figure I can make it
in two-and-a-haIf days...

...but I'm gonna have to hauI ass.

Are you up to this? I mean, I gotta know.

This isn't a game.

I'm in deep shit and I gotta know
what you're gonna do.

I don't know...

...I don't know, Louise.

-I don't know what you're asking.
-Don't start fIaking out on me!

Goddamn it, every time that we get
in troubIe you just get bIank or...

...pIead insanity or some such shit.

Not this time. I mean,
this time things have changed.

Everything's changed.

But I'm goin' to Mexico.

I'm goin'.

Louise?

/s that the way you answer the phone?

I was afraid I missed you.

I got it.

I was afraid of cashing
a check on Saturday.

Who did it?

A frlend who owns a club.
Doug Randall.

You didn't teII him what it was for?

I didn't say what it was for.
I toId him I was buyin' a car.

Good. That's reaI good.
Listen, where do I go?

It's a pIace caIIed the Vagabond MoteI.

It's at 1921, North East 23rd.

It's under ''Peaches.''

What?

That's the code word.

I miss you, Peaches.

Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate it.

Ma'am, you sure you wouIdn't rather have
the Iarge economy size?

No, that's okay.

What are you Iookin' at?

I want you to caII DarryI.

CaII him?

TeII him you're having a wonderfuI time
and you'II be home tomorrow night.

WiII I be?

I don't know.

I won't.

The newspaper.

This is DarryI.

-Wlll you accept the charges?
-Why, yes, I wiII, operator.

TheIma, where in the sam hiII are you?

I'm with Louise.

We're in the mountains, fishin'.

Have you Iost your mind? Is that it?

I Ieave for work, and you take
compIete Ieave of your senses?

DarryI, caIm down, pIease.

Don't get so mad. I can expIain, okay?

-You see, Louise--
-HoId on! HoId on!

Now, come on, pick it!

Shit. Go!

We're just gonna stay there,
fish and hang out and stuff and...

...we'II be gone one more day.
We'II be home tomorrow.

No, you won't. You'II be back today.

Now, you get your butt
back here, TheIma, now.

Goddamn it!

DarryI, you're my husband not my father.

That Louise is nothin' but a bad infIuence!

If you're not back here by tonight...

...TheIma...

...weII then, I just don't wanna say.

TheIma?

Go fuck yourseIf.

That's good, that's just sweet.

Shit!

DarIing, you aII right? Are you okay?

-Did I cause that?
-No, I'm sorry.

No? You okay?

AII right. Is there something
I can do for you?

No, it's okay.

Crazy women.

Excuse me, ma'am.

May I ask where you're heading?

I'm trying to get back to schooI.
My ride feII through....

I'm stuck here Iike stink on stink.

So, I was thinking,
if you're goin' my way or...

...if I'm going your way.

I think we're going to OkIahoma City.

But I'm not sure.

Yeah, weII, I'd appreciate it much.

WeII, see, it's reaIIy not up to me.
It's not my car.

We'd have to ask my friend.

But, she'd probabIy say no.

She's a IittIe bit uptight.

Maybe it's not such a good idea.

But, I thank you for your time.

But, you know, I can ask. It wouIdn't hurt.

WeII, no, it wouIdn't hurt.

Hey, Louise.

This young man here's
on his way back to schooI...

...and I thought since we're going
in the same direction...

...we couId give him a ride, huh?

It's probabIy not a good idea.

No, probabIy not, but I appreciate
your time. You aII have a good day.

Drive safe.

Did you see how poIite he is?
He was so sweet.

-TheIma.
-What?

Bye.

FiII 'er up.

Sure wish we couId have
brought him with us.

What did DarryI have to say?

He said, ''Okay, TheIma, I just wanted
to make sure you was aII right.

''Hope you're havin' fun.
You deserve it.

''After aII you've put up with me.
I Iove you honey.''

So, how Iong before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

I just didn't think it wouId hurt
to give somebody a ride.

Did you see his butt?

DarryI don't have a cute butt.

You couId park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood
for company right now.

Here, take this map. I need you to find
aII the secondary roads...

...to Mexico from OkIahoma City.

I think we shouId stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

Looks Iike we couId get
on this Road 81 here...

...and head down towards DaIIas.

No, I don't want to go through Texas.
Find some way we don't have to.

Wait.

What?

You want to go to Mexico
from OkIahoma...

...but you don't want to go through Texas?

You know how I feeI about Texas!
We're not goin' that way!

Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're running for our Iives.

I mean, can't you make an exception?

Look at this map.
The onIy thing between OkIahoma...

-...and Mexico is Texas. Look!
-I'm not gonna taIk about this.

You find another way or give me
the goddamn map and I wiII!

-Do you understand?
-No, Louise, I don't.

Now, how come you never toId me
what happened to you there?

Look, you shoot off a guy's head...

...with his pants down, Texas is not...

...the pIace you wanna get caught.

Now, trust me.

Now, I'm not gonna taIk
about this anymore.

Happy birthday, Iady.

Is the manager in?

Marian, there's a poIice officer here.

AII right, TheIma. AII right.

Okay.

The other night there was a murder
out at the SiIver BuIIet.

A man was shot.

And we have some witnesses
that saw a 1966...

...T-Bird convertibIe Ieaving the scene.

Sort of speeding out of the driveway there.

And that vehicIe is registered
to one, Louise Sawyer.

We have reason to beIieve that your wife
was the other occupant of that car.

What?

Excuse me.

You're standing in your pizza.

Oh! Shit!

TeII me, Ms. TheIma.
Why ain't you got any kids?

I mean, God gives you somethin' speciaI,
I think you ought to pass it on.

-WeII, DarryI, that's my husband--
-DarryI?

Yeah, he says he's not ready yet.

Says he's stiII a kid himseIf.

Kind of prides himseIf on being infantiIe.

-He has a Iot to be proud of.
-Louise and him don't get aIong.

WeII, that's putting it miIdIy.

-She thinks he's a pig.
-I know he's a pig.

Did you get married
reaI young, Ms. TheIma?

WeII, I guess 18's kinda young.

But we'd aIready been going out
for four years when we got married.

-Out for how Iong?
-Four years.

I never been with anybody but DarryI.

Oh, I'm sorry.

If you don't mind me saying so...

...he sounds Iike a reaI asshoIe.

It's okay.

He is an asshoIe.

But most of the time I just Iet it sIide.

You better sIow down there, Ms. Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

Maybe you got
a few too many parking tickets.

We'II take you to OkIahoma City,
then you go your own way.

AII right.

Prints on the trunk of the car
match those of TheIma Dickinson.

I'II be damned. Isn't that strange?

And the husband says a gun is missing.

She took a Iot of stuff.

It Iooks Iike she maybe pIanned
on being gone a whiIe.

The strange thing is...

...her husband said
she wouId never touch that gun.

He got it for her 'cause he's out Iate a Iot...

...but he said she'd never touch it...

...wouIdn't Iearn to shoot it.
Just kept it in a drawer for years.

-What kind of gun was it?
-38.

Right. Where are they?

They were on their way
to some guy's cabin...

...and they never showed up.

AII right. Now I'm gonna go in....

Listen up, you two, I'm going in...

...it's just gonna take a minute.
You two better say your good-byes.

I'm here to pick up a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

There's nothing.

How about ''Peaches''?
CouId you try code word ''Peaches''?

Did I hear somebody say ''Peaches''?

-My God. Jimmy.
-That's the secret word.

Show the Iady what she's won, Don.

What are you doin' here?

I just came to see you, baby.

Can I have another room, pIease?
Put it on my credit card.

TheIma, get your foot down.

Look who's here.

Oh, shit! Jimmy. Hi, stranger.

What on earth are you doin' here?

Ask me no questions
and I'II teII you no Iies.

Good answer. Same goes doubIe for me.

-Who's the cowboy?
-Oh, this here, this is J.D.

He's a student.
We're just giving him a ride to here.

And then he, Louise said
that he wouId have to go, so he's gone...

...I guess that's where he's going to.

He's gone.

-Have a good trip.
-Thank you.

Nice meeting you.

That's him goin'. I Iove watchin' him go.

TheIma kinda took to him.

WeII, we got you a room there, TheIma.

Go on in and take yourseIf
a nice coId shower.

WeII, you know me, Jimmy,
I'm just a wiId woman.

It's our future.

What are you gonna teII him?

Nothin'.

I'm not gonna teII him a thing.

The Ieast I can do is not make him
any more of an accessory than he is.

You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you reaIIy are.

Imagine not wantin' to drag him into this.

I didn't ask him to come.

As I said, he's no different
than any other.

He just Ioves the chase, is aII.

He's sure got his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

TheIma, just put a Iid on it!

Now...

...I want you to just, you guard that money.

Okay.

And if there's any probIem...

...then you caII me in Room 211.

I won't wait up.

-You want a drink?
-No.

Why don't you teII me what's goin' on?

I'm not gonna teII you what's goin' on.

Soon you'II understand why I can't...

...but I'm not goin' to, so don't ask me.

-Can I ask you one thing?
-Maybe.

Are you in Iove with somebody eIse?

Does this have somethin' to do
with another man?

No, it's not anything Iike that.

WeII then, what is it, goddamn it?

Were you just gonna Ieave
for fucking ever?

What, did you fuckin' kiII somebody?

You start this shit, I'm outta here!

I'm sorry.

Come back here and sit down.

I wanna give you somethin'.

-I'm fine right here.
-I wanna give you somethin'.

Give it to me here.

Why don't you try it on?

WeII, you didn't see
that one comin', did you?

Why, Jimmy?

Why, now?

Try not to get too excited, Louise. I just...

...fIew across two states
with that ring in my fuckin' hand and...

...you know I hate to fIy.

You came aII this way...

...because you thought
I was with somebody eIse.

No, that's not why I came.

Because, you know,
I don't want to Iose you.

And I get the feeIing
Iike you're gonna Iike spIit.

-PermanentIy.
-That's not a good reason to get married.

WeII, I thought that's what you wanted.

I did.

But not Iike this.

-Louise?
-No, TheIma, it's me.

Surprise.

I was just out there
and I was just thinking that...

...I know I'm supposed
to be gone and aII but...

...you know.

And I'm not havin' a turd's Iuck
getting a ride out in this rain.

I was just thinkin' about you.

This is crazy.

I'm gonna get out of your hair, aII right?

WeII.

Wait.

Where you goin'?

Ah, I don't know. You know. Nowhere.

You think I'm happy
with pIayin' gigs...

...in Ramada Inn Iounges?

You think it's just you
with dreams that don't happen?

We both got what we settIed for.

I think maybe
you just don't Iove me anymore.

No, I do Iove you.

But I think it's time to just...

...Iet go of the oId mistakes.

Just chaIk it up to...

...bad timin'.

I think it's time to Iet go.

Again.

Come on.

You're too easy. Come on.

AII right, I'II do it.

Come on.

WeII, don't Ieave 'em, just Ieave 'em there.

You see, this is an unfair advantage.
You got too much metaI goin' here.

You want to Iighten the Ioad a IittIe bit?

I think that's better. What do you think?

Yeah, okay.

-Take me, break me, make me mad!
-Watch your head.

-CarefuI.
-Oh, my head's fine.

Who are you, anyway?

I'm the great and powerfuI Oz.
Who do you want to be?

TeII me, I know you're not
just some schooIboy.

-Nobody ever teIIs me shit.
-Oh, I'm just some guy.

Guy whose paroIe officer...

...is probabIy havin'
a shit fit right about now.

What do you mean, paroIe officer?

-What? Are you a criminaI?
-No, not no more, TheIma.

Let's see, besides bustin' paroIe
I haven't done one wrong thing.

-What'd you do?
-I'm a robber.

-You're a bank robber?
-No.

I don't rob no banks. Come on.

What'd you rob?

WeII, Iet's see.

Let's add it up here, I...

...robbed a gas station...

...a coupIe of convenience stores,
Iiquor stores.

Oh, my God.

How?

Come on.

See, first you pick your pIace, aII right?

Then I just sit back
and watch it for a whiIe.

Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

You gotta know it up here...

...that shit cannot be taught. Yeah, then...

-...I don't want to taIk about this.
-Come on. I do.

AII right.

Then I'd...

...waItz right in, yep...

...and I'd just kinda waItz on in and I'd say:

''Ladies. GentIemen.

''Let's see who best keeps their cooI.

''Simon says:
Everybody down on the fIoor.

''Now, nobody Ioses their head,
then nobody Ioses their head.

''You, sir. You do the honors.

''Take that cash and put it in the bag.

''You've got a great story to teII friends.

''If not, weII, you got a tag
on your toe. You decide.''

It's as simpIe as that.

Then I'd just sIip on out.

And, get the heII out of Dodge, yeah.

My goodness.

You were sure gentIemanIy about it.

I've aIways beIieved that done properIy...

...armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totaIIy unpIeasant experience.

What?

You're a reaI Iive outIaw, aren't you?

I may be an outIaw, darIin', but...

...you're the one steaIin' my heart.

Oh, smooth. Oh, you're smooth.

Isn't he?

I sure am.

Keep it that way.

Remember when we first met?

What happened? TeII me what you said.

I said you had a nice pair of eyes.

And what'd I say?

Do you remember?

You shut 'em.

Asked me if I knew what coIor they were.

And what'd you say?

I didn't know.

Jimmy, what coIor are my eyes?

They're brown.

Wait.

You aII want some more coffee?

Thank you.

Look, I don't know what's goin' on
with you, or what happened, or...

...what you aII did...

...but I'm not gonna teII anybody
and I'm not gonna...

...say that I even saw you.

What'd you do? Take some kind of piII?

Makes you say aII the right stuff?

I'm chokin' on it.

You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

I think it's probabIy not
a reaI good idea right now.

But I'II catch up with you Iater.

On down the road.

WeII....

My taxi's here.

Why don't you just keep that?

Thanks.

I just want you to be happy.

I am happy, sweetie.

Happy as I can be.

AII right.

Why don't you give oI' Jimmy
a kiss goodbye?

And, I'II be gettin' out of here.

Come here, IittIe Jimmy.

-I'II be seeing you, Louise.
-I know.

Okay, have a safe trip.

It's a good thing he Ieft when he did.

We thought we were gonna
have to put out a fire.

What happened to your hair?

Nothin'. Got messed up.

TheIma, what's wrong with you?

Nothin'.

Why, do I seem different?

Now that you mention it, yeah...

...you seem Iike you're crazy
or you're on drugs.

I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy!

TheIma, what happened?

-What happened?
-J.D. came back.

Oh, my God, Louise.

-No!
-I can't beIieve....

-I mean I just can't beIieve it.
-No!

Oh, my God, it's Iike....

I now understand
what aII the fuss is about.

Now, it's Iike a whoIe 'nother baII game.

Oh, darIin', I'm so happy for you.

That's great. I reaIIy am.

You finaIIy got Iaid properIy.
That's so sweet.

-Where is he now?
-He's takin' a shower.

TheIma, you Ieft him aIone in the room?

Where's the money?
My God, TheIma, where's the money?

It's on the bed tabIe. It's okay.

It's on the nightstand! It's okay.

Goddamn it!

I've never been Iucky! Not one time!

Shit!

Son of a bitch robbed me.

I don't beIieve it.

Louise...

...you okay?

Louise...

...I'm sorry, I mean it.

Louise, it's okay.

-It's okay.
-No, TheIma, it's not okay.

It's definiteIy not okay.

None of this is okay.

I mean...

...what are we gonna do for money?

Huh?

How we gonna get gas?

I mean, tradin' on our good Iooks?

Goddamn it, TheIma, it's not okay.

Louise, hey, now you Iisten to me.

Don't you worry about it. You hear me?

Come on. Stand up.

Louise, just don't worry about it.

You hear?

Come on.

Come on, baby. Damn it!

Get your stuff and Iet's get out of here.

Move!

Jesus Christ, come on.

Take your damn time.
Come on, here we go.

Damn!

Afraid of a IittIe rain, Max?

WeII, come on in. Wipe your feet.

As you know, we've tapped your phone...

...in the event that she caIIs in.

Is that gonna cost me?

Excuse me, may I?

Live it up. That's what it's there for.

We're going to have someone here,
at the house, on the phones...

...untiI we find them.

The important thing is not to Iet on
that you know anything.

We'II try to find out where they are.

I don't want to get too personaI...

...but do you have
a good reIationship with your wife?

I Iove TheIma.

I don't intend anything by that, sir.

It's just a question I have to ask.
Are you cIose with her?

Yeah. I guess.

I mean...

...I'm about as cIose as I can be
to a nutcase Iike that.

WeII, if she caIIs, just be gentIe.

You know, Iike,
you're reaIIy happy to hear from her.

Like you reaIIy miss her.

Women Iove that shit.

Okay, if you say so.

''Women Iove that shit.''

Sorry it's just....

Oh, cooI. Can I wear these?

Want anything?

Drive, Louise!

Drive! Start the car!

Go!

What happened?

You robbed the store?

-You robbed the goddamned store?
-WeII, we needed the money.

-It's not Iike I kiIIed anybody.
-TheIma!

I'm sorry.

We needed the money, now we have it.

Oh, shit! Oh, shit, TheIma!

-Louise.
-Oh, shit.

Come on, get a grip.
Drive us to Mexico, wiII you?

Okay.

Oh, shit!

WeII, what? How, how'd you,
I mean, what'd you say?

WeII, I just waItzed on in there and I said:

Now stay down on the floor
tlll /'m gone. Have a good day.

Jesus Christ!

Good God.

My Lord.

Hey, Louise. Better sIow down.

I'd just die if we got caught
over a speeding ticket.

You know, for the first time in my Iife
I wish this car wasn't green.

ShouId we drive Iike this?

In broad dayIight and aII?

No, but I want to put
some distance between us...

...and the scene of our Iast goddamn crime!

Oh, man, you wouIdn't have beIieved it.

It was if I'd been doin' it aII my Iife.

I mean, nobody wouId beIieve it.

-Think you found your caIIin'?
-Maybe.

The caII of the wiId!

-You are disturbed!
-Yeah! I beIieve I am.

TheIma. Don't you Iitter.

Wait a minute. Shit.

God, I hate when....

This aIways happens
when you're in a hurry.

Damn.

What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk aII day?

Try to.

Oh, isn't that nice?
Truck drivers are aIways so nice.

Best drivers on the road.

Look.

How originaI.

-Hey, hi.
-Thank you.

Oh, man, that's disgustin'!

Oh! You pig! You pig!
Just a fucking pig! That's gross.

-What's he gotta do that for?
-Oh! I don't know.

They think we Iike it.
They think it turns us on.

Shut up!

James Lennox?

Yeah, who wants to know?

Arkansas State PoIice.

Hi.

TheIma!

What?

I want you to caII DarryI.

What for?

I want you to find out if he knows
anything. If you think he does...

...you gotta hang up....

Means the cops have toId him...

...and the phone's probabIy tapped.

Tapped the phone?

What are you taIkin' about?

Come on, TheIma.
Murder One and armed robbery.

Murder One?

We can't say it was seIf defense?

It wasn't. We were waIkin' away.

Yeah, but they don't know that.
It was just you and me there.

It was rape, you had to shoot.

That's aImost the truth.

-It won't work.
-Why not?

There's no physicaI evidence.
We can't prove he did it.

We can't even probabIy prove by now
that he touched you.

God.

Law is some tricky shit, isn't it?

How do you know about aII this stuff?

Besides, what'II we say about the robbery?

There's no excuse for that.

There's no such thing
as justifiabIe robbery.

AII right, Louise, wiII you?
Where'd you get this?

StoIe it.

Hi.

Hi!

Who's the nut?

That's Mrs. Dickinson's husband.

Shit twice and faII back in it.

God.

Where'd you get the $6,600 in cash?

A friend.

We spoke with a man today
who says he deIivered...

...very cIose to that same amount
to a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

Do you know her, too?

Yes, sir.

I beIieve she was
the woman drivin' the car.

He said he took it to a moteI
in OkIahoma City.

He aIso says that at that time
he met a man.

He identified you
through a series of mug shots.

He aIso toId us that you
and Mrs. Dickinson seemed ''cIose.''

Is that true?

WeII, sir.

You might say
we had a meetin' of the minds, yeah.

Are you aware that Mrs. Dickinson...

...and Ms. Sawyer are wanted
with regards to a murder?

Murder? What, TheIma? Damn!

Did they ever indicate that they might be
on the run from the Iaw?

Now that you mention it...

...they might have seemed
a IittIe bit jumpy.

-You know what?
-What?

You're starting to irritate me.

Me, too.

WeII, that'II happen.

You boys've much in common.

Maybe I shouId just step out
of the room for a sec.

I got a better idea.

Do you mind if I speak to him aIone,
for a minute?

What? What'd I do? Nothin', that's what.

TeII you somethin',
this is just a crock of shit...

...Mr. John fucking Law.

Son, I got a feeIing about something and...

...I just wanna ask your opinion.

You think TheIma Dickinson
wouId've committed armed robbery...

...if you hadn't taken aII their money?

Get your foot off that tabIe.

-Cat got your tongue?
-No, naw.

WeII, how do you know I took it?

How do you know they didn't--

Don't you fucking Iie to me!

There's two girIs out there
that had a chance. They ''had'' a chance.

-And now you've screwed it up for them.
-No.

And now they're in some serious troubIe.

I'm gonna hoId you responsibIe...

...for at Ieast part of it
if anything happens to them.

I got no feeIin' for you.

Now, you're either gonna teII me
every damn thing you know...

...so there's a smaII chance...

...that I can actuaIIy do them some good...

...or I'm gonna be aII over you
Iike a fIy on shit for the rest of your Iife.

Your miseries wiII be
my goddamn mission in Iife.

Yes, sir.

-Okay?
-Yeah. That's right.

-We understand each other?
-Yeah.

Mr. Dickinson?

WouId you just hang on?
I want a word with you.

I Iike your wife.

Hey, come back here!

Come back here, you IittIe shit!

I'II eat you up!

Come here, give it.
I'II, come here! Come here!

Come on! I'II kiII you!

-Let's go home now, DarryI.
-I'II kiII you!

What wiII it be, Iadies?

FiII 'er up.

There you go.

Excuse me, do you have a phone?

Thank you.

TheIma, Iisten up, now.

Even if you think he knows,
even if you're not sure...

...I want you to hang up, you understand?

Yeah.

HeIIo.

DarryI, it's me.

TheIma! HeIIo!

He knows.

I need more time.

What?

AII I said was, ''HeIIo.''

Yeah?

Darryl, thls ls Loulse.
Let me talk to the pollce.

Hey, Louise.

Let me talk to the pollce.

What do you mean?
There's no poIice here.

-Where are you girIs, anyway?
-Just walt, Darryl.

Can / talk to whoever's ln charge there?

How do you know there's--

HeIIo, Ms. Sawyer?

I'm, Investigator HaI SIocombe,
Arkansas State PoIice.

How are you?

WeII, I've been better.

Be careful wlth that gun.

Yes, I know.

You glrls are ln some hot water.
You both okay? Nelther one ofyou hurt?

Oh, yes, sir, we're fine.

-We're both fine.
-Good.

You want to tell me what happened?

Sure, over coffee, sometime. I'II buy.

I want you to know neither one of you
are charged with murder yet.

You're just stiII wanted for questioning.

AIthough now...

...Mrs. Dickinson's wanted
in OkIahoma for armed robbery.

No, kiddin'?

We gotta go. I'II caII you back, aII right?

I don't think you aII
are gonna make it to Mexico.

We should talk. Please.

/ want to help you.

Shit.

That J.D. kid is a IittIe shit.

What?

What?

TheIma, how did they know
we're goin' to Mexico, huh?

How did they know that?

You toId that thievin' IittIe shit
where we were goin'?

I just toId him if he ever got to Mexico,
he shouId Iook us up.

But I didn't. I asked him not to teII...

...I thought he wouId not
teII anybody, you know.

-Why?
-I didn't think he'd teII anybody.

Why? What's he to Iose?
Except my Iife's savings.

Shit!

TheIma, goddamn it!

Look, I'm sorry, I mean--

Oh, goddamn it, TheIma!

Up untiI now we had
onIy two things going for us.

No one knew where we were
or where we were goin'.

Now one of the things goin' for us is gone!

Look, TheIma, you just gotta stop
taIkin' to peopIe.

You gotta stop bein' so open.
We're fugitives now, right?

Let's start behavin' Iike that.

You're right.

-Thank you.
-Okay.

-/ was wonderlng--
-Llsten, llttle boy.

Of course / wantyou to go.

That's what's worrylng you.
Please, don't thlnk--

/ wasn't worrylng about that.

/ knew you'd want me to take thejob--

Sorry.

Let's get marrled.

My God, this is beautifuI.

It sureIy is.

I aIways wanted to traveI.
I just never got the opportunity.

You got it now.

What's going on?

Nothin'.

Shit. WeII, we don't need
the East Coast anymore.

Hey, Iook!

Look who it is, it's that guy.

-I'II be darned.
-Just ignore him.

Oh, baby! I'm your captain muff diver!

Your storm trooper of Iove!

I ignored him.

What?

What?

HarIan.

-What about him?
-Nothin'.

Just the...

...just the Iook on his face when--

What?

He did. He sure wasn't expectin' that.

''Suck my dick.''

TheIma, it's not funny.

I know.

It happened to you, didn't it?

What? What are you taIkin' about?

In Texas.

I mean that's
what happened to you, isn't it?

You was raped.

Hey, TheIma, Iook,
I'm warnin' you. Just drop it.

I'm not gonna taIk about that.

You understand?

-I'm not taIkin' about it.
-Okay.

-You understand?
-Yeah.

Okay, Louise.

It's okay.

Oh, shit! TheIma!

We're getting puIIed over.

Shit!

Shit!

What shaII we do?

I don't know. AII right,
we're just gonna pIay it by ear.

Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe he's just gonna give me a ticket.

God, pIease don't Iet us get caught.

God, pIease, don't Iet us get caught.

AII right, I'm just gonna puII over.

Turn off your engine.

He's putting on his hat.

-My God, he's a Nazi.
-What's he doing?

He's kinda waIking this way.

HeIIo, officer.

Is there a probIem?

You want to Iet me see
your Iicense, pIease?

Right.

Here it is.

Can you take it out of your waIIet, pIease?

AII right.

I toId you to sIow down.
Officer, I toId her to sIow down.

She did. How fast was I goin'?

About 110.

You want to get out of the car?

Yes, sir. Sure.

-Come with me, pIease.
-Yes, sir.

-This your vehicIe?
-Yes, sir, that is.

-You want to get in the car, pIease?
-Yes, sir.

-Front or the back?
-Front.

Do you want to take off

Yes sir.

Am I in troubIe, officer?

As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am,
you're in a Iot of troubIe.

HeIIo, this is 9-8....

You want to step back
and get in your car again, pIease?

Officer.

I am so sorry about this.

WouId you Iet go of that?

Now, I reaIIy apoIogize, but wouId you
put your hands on the steering wheeI?

See, if you get on that radio...

...you'II find out
that we're wanted in two states...

...and probabIy considered armed
and dangerous, at Ieast I am...

...and then our whoIe pIan's
just gonna be aII shot to heII.

Louise, take his gun.

Take his gun, Louise. It's right there.

Right. I'm reaI sorry. Excuse me.

You want to step out of the car, pIease?

I swear, three days ago

...wouId've ever puIIed
a stunt Iike this, but...

...if you was ever to meet my husband,
you'd understand why.

You want to put your hands
on your head, pIease?

Louise.

-What?
-Shoot the radio.

Right.

The poIice radio, Louise.

-Jesus Christ!
-I'm sorry.

Got it.

Okay.

You want to step to the back
of the car, pIease?

Louise, get the keys.

TheIma, what is it? What's wrong?

Air hoIes.

Open the trunk.

Shit, TheIma.

Who'd have thought it?

You want to step into the trunk, pIease?

PIease, I have a wife and kids. PIease.

You do? WeII, you're Iucky.

You be sweet to 'em...

...especiaIIy your wife.

My husband wasn't sweet to me,
Iook how I turned out.

Now, go on. Get in there.

Wait a second. Excuse me.

Wait a minute, officer.

CouId I have your beIt, pIease?

-Extra ammo.
-Good idea.

CouId I trade gIasses with you, maybe?

Thanks.

Okay. Is that it?

Officer, I'm reaI sorry about this.

I apoIogize, aIso.

Go.

-You ready?
-Hit it.

I know it's crazy...

...but I feeI Iike I got a knack for this shit.

I beIieve you do.

Drive Iike heII.

One thing I can't figure out is...

...whether these girIs
are reaI smart or just reaI Iucky.

It don't matter.

Brains'II onIy get you so far
and Iuck aIways runs out.

-Louise, we stiII going to Mexico?
-Yeah.

Then, aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

I figure if you take a state poIiceman...

...his gun, shoot his car,
Iock'im in the trunk...

...it's best to get on out
of the state if you can.

I heard that.

Don't ding my car!

I think I fucked up.

I think I got us in a situation
where we both couId get kiIIed.

I don't know why I just didn't go
to the poIice right away.

You know why. You aIready said.

What'd I say, again?

Nobody'd beIieve us.

We'd stiII get in troubIe,
we'd stiII have our Iives ruined.

-You know what eIse?
-What?

That guy was hurting me.

If you hadn't come when you did,
he wouId've hurt me a Iot worse.

He'd have IikeIy got off free...

...'cause I was seen dancin' with him.

They wouId've made out
Iike I'd asked for it.

My Iife wouId've been ruined
a whoIe Iot worse than it is now.

At Ieast now I'm havin' some fun.

And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch is dead.

I'm just sorry you did it and not me.

Hello.

Let me taIk to SIocombe.

She wants to taIk to you.

-HeIIo, Louise.
-Hey.

-How are thlngs golng out there?
-Weird.

We got some kind of a snowbaII effect
happening here or somethin'.

But you're stiII with us.

Somewhere on the face of the earth?

We're not in the middIe of nowhere,
but we can see it.

I swear.

I aImost feeI Iike I know you.

WeII, you don't.

You're in deeper
every moment you're gone.

WouId you beIieve
this thing was an accident?

I do beIieve you.

That's what I want everybody to beIieve.

TroubIe is, it doesn't Iook Iike an accident.

And you're not here to teII me about it.

I need your heIp here.
Did HarIan Puckett--

-/ don't wanna talk about that.
-You wanna come on in?

Don't thlnk so.

Then, I'm sorry.

We're gonna have to
charge you with murder.

Do you want to come out of thls allve?

You know...

...certain words
keep drifting through my mind.

Things Iike incarceration,
cavity search, death by eIectrocution.

Life imprisonment, shit Iike that.
You know what I mean?

So do I want to come out aIive?

I don't know, I....

I don't know. I think...

...we're gonna have to think about that.

Louise, I'II do anything.

I know what's making you run.

I know what happened to you in Texas.

Come on, Louise.

Don't bIow it.

We got it!

Give it to me.

God! Max. You gotta take me there.

No, HaI, cannot do.

I'm the onIy one she's...

...ever spoken to.

You're no good to me, now.
There's nothing you can do for me.

I don't want anybody Iosing their heads.

You know what happens.

VoIume gets turned way up...

...and the next thing you know
these girIs are gonna get shot!

What?

You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

What do you mean?

You're not gonna make
a deaI with that guy?

I mean...

...I just want to know.

TheIma, I'm not making any deaIs.

I mean, I'd understand
if you was thinkin' about it.

In a way, you got somethin'
to go back for, Jimmy and aII.

Jimmy's not an option.

But...

...I don't know, you know...

...something's Iike crossed over in me.

I can't go back. I mean...

...I just couIdn't Iive.

I know.

I know what you mean.

Anyway, we don't want to end up
on the damned GeraIdo Show.

Yeah.

They're charging us with murder.

Yeah, they say that we gotta figure out...

...if we want to come in dead or aIive.

Gosh.

Did he say anything positive at aII?

You awake?

Guess you couId caII it that.
My eyes are open.

Me, too. I feeI awake.

Good.

Wide awake.

I don't remember ever feeIing this awake.
You know what I mean?

Everything Iooks different.

You feeI Iike that, too, Iike...

...you got something to Iook forward to?

We'II be drinking margaritas
by the sea, Mamasita.

-We couId change our names.
-We couId Iive in a hacienda.

I'm gonna get a job.

I'm gonna work at CIub Med.

Now what kind of a deaI is that cop
gonna have to come up with to beat that?

-Have to be pretty good.
-Have to be pretty damn good.

But / do have some advlce to pass along...

...rlght here ln the words of thls song.

Oh, my God, Louise. Oh, Iook.

See it, that's him.

It's him. It's definiteIy him.

''I want to show you
