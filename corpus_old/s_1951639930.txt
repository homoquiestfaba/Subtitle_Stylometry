Max!

Uh-huh?

Ready to concede?

No!

I thought as it's
your last night here,

it only appropriate that we
open something extra special.

Bandol.

Excellent choice.

Tempier Bandol, 1969.

The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

collapse in a heap

after drinking just a single glass.

Perhaps my knee landing
squarely in his testicles...

...may have been partly to blame.

What was I talking about before?

You said the importance
of a good blue suit

can never be overstated.

Quite right.

A blue suit is the most
versatile of accoutrements.

More important
than the suit itself

is the man who fits it for you.

Once you find a good tailor,

you must never give his name away,

not even under the threat

of bodily harm.

Now, where were we?

-Whose turn is it?
-Mine.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Max, have I told you why I enjoy

-making wine so much?
-You don't

make the wine, Uncle Henry,
that guy Duflot does.

In France,
it's always the landowner

who makes the wine.

Even though he does
nothing more than supervise

with binoculars
from the comfort of his study.

No, I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar

is quite simply incapable of lying.

Picked too early,
picked too late, it matters not.

The wine will always whisper
into your mouth

with complete, unabashed honesty,

every time you take a sip.

Mmm,

delightful.

Now, Maximillian,

now you know why
I love wine so much,

have you anything
you want to tell me?

Yes, I do.

Yes, what is it?

Checkmate.

You little shit.

-Good morning, lab rats.
-Good morning, Max.

Today we're shifting gear.

Today... is Greedy Bastard Day.

The secret to riches, lab rats,

is the same as the secret to comedy...

timing.

-115. 10, Max.

So I thought we should move now.

-Not yet, Alf.
-Boss,

why do you keep calling me Alf?

Because you're an aggressive
little flunky, Kenny.

And as your boss

and genetic superior,

I can call you whatever I want.

Max Skinner's phone.

It's Kimberly.
Is Max there?

Yeah. One moment, please.

It's Kimberly.

-Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
-Where is he?

He and his fiancée

are at their wedding
rehearsal today.

-Their what?
-Do you want me to leave him a message?

No, I don't want
to leave him a message!

Okay.

115. 90...

116...

116. 10.

All right, lab rats, just remember

we're not here for the dental plan.

50 big!
People are buying! Max?

Sell.

That's yours!

I said that's yours!

That miserable sod Skinner's
dumping bonds

-onto the market.
-But he can't do that.

There's a gentleman's agreement
on the exchange.

A gentleman's agreement presupposes

-there's a gentleman involved.
-Amis,

he put out $5 billion
in sell orders-prices are

-crashing through the floor!
-Come on,

people, get off your asses!

Come on, step to it!
Start selling!

-Sell!

They should bury you
face down, Max,

because that's the way you're going.

Free big figures to 113. 50!

Sell! Sell!

Still going down.

Buy.

Fuckin' buy it all back!

Buy it all back immediately!

Buy it all back!
It's yours to buy back!

Don't worry about it!
Buy it all back!

You're a genius, Max!

Filthy bugger,
he's forced down prices.

He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap!

Start buying!

Buying now! Start buying!

-I can!
-I can!

Well done today, lab rats.

Wonderful work.

We all made
a spectacular amount of money.

Today we proved the adage that

winning isn't everything...

It's the only thing!

And there were strange goings-on

on the bond market today.

Prices crashed to 112. 5,
after Lorden Brothers

unloaded $3 billion in sell orders.

Then in an extraordinary
move, the company bought the bonds back

at a substantially reduced price,

making over $77 million

-in the process.
-Blimey.

Cries of foul play were loud

and widespread, with talks
of an inquiry to follow.

Morning, Mr. Skinner.

-Morning, Bert.
-And congratulations.

-Thank you.
-You might've tipped me off,

Mr. Skinner.

I'll give you a tip, Bert:

Never pat a burning dog.

Wanker.

Oh, Henry, bloody hell.

<i>Ready for the fan mail?</i>

Shoot, sunshine.

-"Bastard. "
-Uh-huh.

"Bastard. "

Uh-huh.

-"Burn in hell. "
-Right.

"Rot in hell. "

Oh. Lovely.

"Die. "

Charming.

Maxie?

"Congratulations, you're my hero. "

Who said that?

Your lawyer.

-Oh.
-Maxie, listen,

I just got off the phone
with, uh, Auzet.

That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.

She the one that sent me the letter?

Yeah.

Anyway, listen, uh, it seems that

your Uncle Henry

hasn't updated his will

in over 20 years.

Which is why,
in typical frog fashion,

they take over a month

to notify us.

All right, so what do we do with that?

Is there a reading of the will,

or do we just download

that sort of thing these days?
What happens?

No, that's the point, Max.

Sorry?

There is no legal will.

Really?

You're his closest blood relative,

-so you get everything.
-What, his clothes

and his Edmundo Ross LPs?

The house, you git.

You get to keep his house.

What, the old farmhouse

and the vineyards and
the grapes and everything?

Place like must be worth
a few quid these days.

Hey.

-Hmm.
-Anyway,

I've booked you a flight

and an appointment with Auzet
for 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

Just a few papers to sign.

Come on, I can't go
to France tomorrow.

Gem, I'm the toast of the town.

I need to do a few victory laps

around the city,
show off a little bit,

have a late night or two.
Oh, come on,

you heard the mail-
it's times like this,

when everyone hates you,
that's when it's fun.

Go on, Max-we'll take good care

of the place when you're gone.

No problems.

Right.

-Ken.
-Mm.

Why don't you go and try and find

some small animals to hurt?

I know, find a poodle and
punt it off the balcony.

Hmm?

-Tell me something, Max.
-Yes?

Did you care for him?

Yes, I did.

When was the last time you spoke?

A long time ago.

Why?

Well, I don't know, Gemma.

That's probably got
something to do

with me becoming an asshole.

Okay.

Max!

-Hello, how are you?
-How are you?

-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

I'm looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.

Oh, well, follow me.

-Danny, how are you?
-Congratulations.

-Thank you. Austin.
-Max, congratulations.

Say hello to your dad for me.

Oh, love, mm.
How are you doing?

-Very well. How are you?
-Oh, Lucy.

-Hello.
-I didn't realize that you two knew each other.

Whoops.

He's adorable.

Mm, magnificent bouquet.

Alluring nose.

Honey and spice.

And all things nice.

Inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues

of brick red,
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.

It's a burgundy.

Yes, I knew it's burgundy.

One for you, sir?

I think I shall have an eclipse.

-Thank you.
-Charles, can we get

our minds off the double
frontage with the view

and onto the French real estate?

What do you think it's worth?

Max, barely a day has passed
since you learned

of the long-lost uncle's

departure from this world,

and all you can think of is money.

The very same uncle you're
talking about, Charles, is

the man who taught me every man
needs a fuck-you million.

Okay, when are you gonna
furnish me with the particulars,

because an estate agent
needs something

he can sink his teeth into.

Well, uh, it's been a while

since I've been there,
but from memory,

at least half a dozen
bedrooms, a pool, tennis...

court, a decent-sized kitchen...

-Thanks.
-11 hectares, a vineyard.

Bloody hell, Max, it sounds
like an estate to me, a château.

What's a château go for these days?

Well, we're obviously in the
"F-You" department, aren't we?

-Maybe several.
-Really?

God bless Henry.

I won't count my commission.

I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.

That's why I'm fond of you.

Well, in that case, Max...

here's to you.

Gemma.

<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

-Yeah?
-Kenny,

I want the current ten-year yield,

I want an update on the figures
for nonfarm payrolls,

and I want you to get
your scrawny little backside

out of my chair.

Thank you.

How'd he know that?

Lance Armstrong!

Maxie! Hi. How are you?

Gemma, come on, love,
admit it: This is

because I didn't shag you
at the Christmas party,

-isn't it?
-Listen, I swear on my life,

Max, they didn't have
any other cars.

So, where are we, Max?

Oh, for bollocky's sake!

Right, I've gone
to the end of that road...

Look, they're both the D-3.

I've got Menerbes on my left,
or I've got Cavaillon on my right,

and they're both on the D-3.

-Go! Go!
-Oh... shut up!

Okay, okay, hang on a minute.
I'll help you. Hang on.

I've got a...
I've got a GPS here

-Go! Go!
-With a stutter and a...

quite frankly,
a shitty, froggy attitude!

Okay, listen, you turn left
and that'll take you straight

onto the N-7, and if you
really put your foot on it,

you might even get
to your appointment on time.

-Bollocks! Bugger!

Mission control.

All right, love, please reschedule

my meeting with the notaire

for first thing tomorrow morning.

Okay.

What about the keys, Max?

-Oh, there used to be a stone, you know.
-Uh-huh.

Uh, by the front door. Ask her to put that...
put the keys under the stone,

and I'll, um,
I'll pick them up from there.

Okay, copy that. Copy that.

Huh.

Hello?

Henry?

<i>Come on, you're slower than your Aunt Midge!</i>

<i>-That's it, Maximillian. </i>

-It's not funny.

What are you, a man or a mouse?

Fine, then, I'm a mouse. Squeak, squeak!

Hopeless, you're hopeless.

Oh, stop it!

Match point.

Ace!

Game! Set!

-Match!
-You cannot be serious!

-Hey.

-You have to rub it in?
-Hey...

The point is, Max, why
you aren't celebrating?

Because I lost!

Well, a man should acknowledge

his losses just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.

Come on, give us a jig.

Give your old uncle a jig.

-Oh, yeah, I lost.
-Arms and up and down.

Yeah, great, yeah, I lost! I lost!

-Uncle Henry won!
-Yes.

-Three cheers!
-Dance, don't shimmy like an Italian.

Well done, Uncle Henry.

This is stupid.

You'll come to see

that a man learns
nothing from winning.

The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.

Not least of which is, uh,

how much more enjoyable it is to win.

It's inevitable to lose now and again.

The trick is not
to make a habit of it.

Drink?

Chicken shit.

-Excuse me?

On the roses.

Oh, fertilizer.

Oh, Tati.

Hello.

Duflot?

<i>Oui. </i>

-Max.
-My God.

Haven't you... matured.

<i>Ah, c'est vrai,
the floods of'78, </i>

-Right.
-Mistral of'86,

-fanleaf disease in '93.

-Fanleaf disease.
-In each vintage I've

corked away another
year of my youth.

But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

-Ludivine.
-Yeah.

<i>And my dog...
ah, voila, Tati. </i>

I expect you're hungry, no?

Please, come tonight.

My wife is roasting a lamb-mmm!

To tell the truth,

I haven't had much of an appetite

since I learned of Henry.

Oh, the very last years,
his sight was failing.

But I tended to things
for him, you know?

We became very close.

Almost like... father and son.

Well, I am most appreciative

that someone was here for him.

Well, my wife will
come in the morning

with croissants, okay?

Huh? She will resume her duties.

<i>-Allez! Bon!
-If you insist. </i>

Hmm.

"Welcome. "

Ah.

Don't mind if I do.

Here's to you, Henry.

Devoting your life to the vines...

and bottling the truth.

Hmm...

That was honest.

Jesus, ought to have
a poison sticker on it.

Ah... coffee, coffee.

What's in here?

And that?

Piss off.

Hmm.

Morning, Henry.

Milk.

Hmm.

Maxie!

Madame Duflot!

Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

-Oh...
-Morning.

Morning, Gemma.

Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

Oh, yes, as bereavements go, you know.

This will cheer you up.

You've been busted.

<i>Morning Financial Times headline:</i>

"Lorden Brothers trade
under investigation. "

You don't have to worry
about any of that.

The FSA today launched
an official inquiry

into recent Lorden Brothers
trade activity.

Yes, well, I double-checked
it all through Legal.

I covered our asses, okay?

It's just bollocks to placate
the lucid back.

Oh, he doesn't think so.

-Nigel?
-Sir Nigel.

He wants a meeting with you today,
5:00 this afternoon.

Well, it must be
about something else.

Um, what time is my meeting
with the notaire?

A little over an hour from now.

My time or yours?

Oh, shit.

Oh, Gemma!

Yes?

How's the house, Max?
Is it gorgeous?

Well, to tell you
the truth, Charlie,

it's a little bit shabby.

We don't say shabby, Max.

We say filled with the patina
of a bygone era.

-How's the wine?
-Right.

Uh, bouquet of a wet dog.

Hits the palate like a razor blade

with a finish that hints of awful.

So the house is falling apart

and the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine?

Excellent.

One thing you are going
to need is an oenologue.

All right, what's that?

It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

They take soil samples-bits of
the vine, that sort of thing-

tests them-there must
be a couple near you.

And also, I would need
a couple of sexy snaps

to get the punters clamoring,

and I have an e-mail address for
you to send them to, which is...

Hold on a second.
I'll just put you on speaker.

Okay, shoot.

Provencelistings@

abroadproperties. Inc.

Shit.

<i>-Hello?
-Attention!</i>

-Hello?
-Shit.

-Max?
-All right, go on.

Auzet.

Hello.

Max Skinner.

The vigneron makes the wine

and the estate owner
maintains the property.

Mr. Skinner?

Yes, hmm, right, well, delightful.

This is how your uncle
and Monsieur Duflot

worked for over 20 years.

Naturally, Monsieur Duflot

will be anxious
as to your intentions.

I think I can speed this up.

I have no intention
of becoming a winemaker.

So let Monsieur Duflot
make the wine

and you enjoy the estate
on the weekends.

I'm not sure you understand me.

My life is in London.

I don't do weekends.

I intend to sell La Siroque

as soon as possible.

And what about, uh,

Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

Look, in all cases like this,
it simply

just comes down to a figure.

Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a plane to catch.

Right.

You're selling La Siroque?

There has been a mistake, I think.

News travels fast.

But your uncle,

he meant for you to have it,

not sell it.

Well, I'm sure if he did,

he would have written
that down in a proper will.

He didn't.

You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.

He was a man of secrets,
a man of passion.

He didn't write things down.

You would take me
away from my vines?

My vines, Duflot.

I live in them,

I breathe in them.

They tear my hands.

Look, Francis, when
I sell the property,

I do intend to make you
a handsome settlement.

Do you know, monsieur,
what it is to love something

more than your own life?

To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?

I have only a few vintages left.

<i>Soon my body and spirit will
be defeated by the terroir. </i>

And you would dare come
here and take away

my last few chances of immortality?

Afraid so. Be in touch.

Leaving now.

Oh, good.

'Cause Sir Nigel has made
a special trip, Max.

-Is everything okay?
-Everything's fine.

Good. Oh, did you remember
to take photos for Charlie?

Yes.

-Damn it!

Idiot.

Let's see you then.

One... two...

...and go!

-Yes?
-Get in the car.

Get off my camera.

-Bollocks!

Oh, come on!
Where's the ladder?

Where are you, tosser?

-Hold on!

Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

Hello.

Oh, no, don't worry about me.

I'm... I'm the pool man.

I do this every Thursday.

It's just routine maintenance.

It's been lovely chatting to you.

And, and you are
a spectacular vision.

But any chance for a rope
or a ladder?

Is that your little car?

Uh, yes, I'm the temporary custodian

of the lime green roller skate,

but it's a hired car; it's a rental.

It's not for sale. Sorry?

-Can you swim?
-Well, yes, but...

but not in a foot of cow shit.

Hello?

Will all passengers on Flight...

He's not on the flight.

Right, right.

Okay, roger that.

What is it, Major Lawrence,

that attracts you, personally,
to the desert?

It's clean.

I like it because it's clean.

Great.

You better be in prison, Maxie.

Yes, just tell him I'm sorry.

There was nothing
I could do about it.

Sorry's no good, Max.
He's gone.

Oh, shit.

Um, what time is the first
flight out in the morning?

Oh, there's no point
in rushing back, Max.

You know, the last thing
Sir Nigel did on his way out

-was to suspend you for a week.
-What?

What the f-does he expect me
to do for a week?

Take a holiday?

Christ, he didn't say that, did he?

No, I just did.

Right, Gemma. Never say that.

If anybody calls,

do not say I'm on holiday.

All right?
That's worse than dying.

Now, look.

I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.

-You just make sure
-Okay.

That every man jack
in there is ready.

Set it up so I can
trade in Kenny's name.

What?

Get him a clearance
at the highest level

on Sir Nigel's recommend.

Are you mad, Max?

Who cares? Just do it.

Don't tell anybody, all right?

Especially not that
little shit, Kenny.

Max, is there a problem?

No, I'm having a great time.

-You sure?
-Yes.

-You just be careful, okay? Okay. Ciao.
-Okay.

Bye.

-Oh, shit!

Shit! Scorpion! Scorpion!
Ludivine!

Scorpion!

-Oh! Drop it! Bloody hell!

Get that little bastard!

Of course.

Okay.

Fits very well; beautifully.

Max?

Are you back in Blighty?

On the contrary, chuckles.

I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.

So it's true,
you are getting the sack.

No, I'm not getting
the sack, Charlie.

I'm just exploring my options,
with a view to realizing

the full potential
of my inheritance.

Well, speaking
of your inheritance,

how soon before we can view?

It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say.

Surprising, actually,
how well it's been maintained.

Hmm. So you don't need

a contractor or anything like that?

Uh, no, no, no, no.
Just needs a...

a coat of paint
and a bit of a scrub.

Okay, you sure?

-No problem at all, Charlie.
-Good.

Charlie?

Charlie, can you hear me?

-Yes.

Can you hear me now?

-Yes.
-Look, I wasn't joking before

about what I said
about the wine they make here.

It is not, I repeat,
not first-class.

-Will that affect our price?
-Well, how bad can it be?

Uh, well,
it gives you a blinding headache

-and it makes you angry.
-Ah.

I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.

Well, we'll just have to make sure

our buyers don't know
anything about wine.

We'll concentrate on the Americans.

Just make sure she's match-fit
in 72 hours.

72 hours.

Righto.

A Lamborghini tractor.

<i>Paintbrush...</i>

paintbrush, paintbrush.

Paintbrush!

You old bugger.

Duflot.

I was just about to use
that paintbrush.

It's my paintbrush.

Gee whiz.

This is fun.

Tell you what,

I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.

-Hmm?
-No.

No?

Fifty.

I'll give you a hundred euros
for your paintbrush, Duflot.

I don't care.
What do you want?

When you sell, I stay vigneron.

I keep my vines.

You want to stay with your vines?

-Mm-hmm.
-Fine.

That means you...

must help me... fix the place up-

do the gardens,

paint the house,
clean the pool-and I,

if at all possible,
will attempt to convince

the new owners
of the worth and value

of your services.

<i>D'accord?</i>

A Frenchman's hand

is his word.

An Englishman's word is his bond.

<i>-Concord?
-Deal. </i>

Frog tosspot.

English prick.

No.

Awfully sorry.

Goal of the day.

Bat. Come on.

Here comes the ball!

Champion of the over-unh!

Let's play.

Come on.

All right, I'm 12-none out.

Okay.

It won't last one month.

If things go
according to plan, Francis,

it will be somebody else's problem.

Monsieur Max!

Yes?

There is, um... a person

-at the door.
-A person?

A person.

<i>Bonjour. </i>

<i>Bonjour. </i>

The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.

Oh.

You speak English.

-Like a native.

I'm Christie Roberts.

I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

You lucky devil, you found him.

Impossible.

You're way too young.

You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

I meant too young to be my dad.

Henry Skinner is my father.

She has Henry's nose.

<i>Allez. Allez. </i>

Wow.

This your mum?

<i>In all her Flashdance glory. </i>

So, uh...

is he around?

Oh, bollocks.

Um...

I'm sorry.
I've forgotten your name.

-It's Christie.
-Christie.

You see, Christie, um...

Henry...

He's dead, huh?

A month ago.

Um...

Cup of tea?

Yes?

Madame Duflot.

Well, no, it's more
than a wrinkle, Max.

What if the girl
turns out to be legit?

Oh, come on, she turns up

a couple months after he parks it?

Far too sweet, Charlie;
I'm not buying it.

You need some legal advice, mate,

and you need it fast,
in case the little minx

screws up the whole deal.

Asking price?

Uh, it's seven and a half.

Did you get that?

Right.

Christie, I'm just going
to pop into town.

Oh, no problem-
I booked a youth hostel,

just in case the old man

-was schizo, you know?
-Oh, right.

Oh, you mind dropping me off?

I really got to get
out of these clothes.

Why don't you just get
out of your clothes here?

Got plenty of space, lots of room.

You can clean up, take a shower.

-I'll be back in a jiff.
-You sure?

Absolutely, absolutely.

Madame Duflot?

<i>Voila. </i>

In the French law, there is no difference between

legitimate and illegitimate
children when it comes

to their right to inherit.

That's bloody ridiculous.

She never even met Henry.

She could very well be an impostor.

That is precisely why
she would be required

to produce some form

of documentation.

Photo or even

correspondence-a love letter.

Yes, yes, yes, but what if I just...
sell the property

before she even makes her claim?

No; legally, she could
invalidate the sale

even after the transfer of title.

Bugger.

My advice, Mr. Skinner,

is to treat her
with the utmost respect.

Goes without saying.

And hope she'll be on her way.

...bugger off.

Don't let this... end in court.

<i>Merci. </i>

Joan of Arc?

Oh, Jacques Cousteau.

You tried to drown me.

And you tried to run me
over with your little car.

What are you talking about,
I tried to run you over?

What sort of bollocks is that?

Down the road from La Siroque,

you were driving your
midget car on your phone.

<i>Bonjour. Bonjour. </i>

And I believe

had your head stuck
very far up your ass.

Look at the damage
you have caused me!

You tried to kill me,

I tried to kill you.

My God.

She's fantastic.

Hey, Max.

Look at the view.

It's like Cézanne.

Oh, Tati. Psst.

Francis...

in, uh, in town today,

I was, um,

I was passing by this restaurant...

Her name is Fanny Chenal.

Right.

Many times, I've seen

this same look on your uncle's face.

But you deserve credit.

Why is that?

You are now the town hero
for making her show

her derriere.

She, um...
She grew up around here, didn't she?

Who?

Fanny Chenal.

I believe, yes.

She, um...

She otherwise spoken for?

She was once.

A football player-for Lyon.

He was shit,

just like his left foot.

He treated her very badly, you know.

Since then, it's rumored
