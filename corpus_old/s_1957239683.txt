okay hey steve steve

[ __ ] mother okay

this is uh day one morning

equipment check equipment check tape one

steve monterey biologist with the

washington state parks department

video record of new dear migratory

patterns due to over development

this is a video diary to visually

document my findings

i believe that the recent increase in

predators that we've seen in the

outlying rural areas is due to a

relatively new change in the migratory

patterns of the prey animals

deer and elk i'll follow the traditional

trails of the uh colombian black-tailed

deer through the cascades and

mark here the environment wish me luck

wes are you ready uh nope

we're scheduled to leave in 10 minutes

we have to hit that first valley tonight

talking about it's not going to make it

go any quicker

hey throw the tags on the logs i don't

know wherever you

put them

so this is dr steven monterey i've

exited i-90 around roughly north bend

i'll have to continue on foot from here

but i expect to follow the

exact migration trail of the

black-tailed deer

if you look through the trees here you

can see there are

multiple houses in the area that's to be

expected

so i have found deerskat and vegetation

that's been chewed on

of course this is just the outside areas

of the uh developments but

i expect to find more evidence as i

progress

what the [ __ ] do you mean i you're only

reporting [ __ ] all by yourself like i'm

not even here

so what this [ __ ] camera


this is dr wesley mason and i will be

reporting

our progress from here on out

you happy now yeah i mean i'm okay now

yeah thank you

we've hiked approximately 15 miles along

the easternly heading

increased amounts of predator sign of

which we've seen a lot

damn it damn it wes would you stop that

and help me

okay we should have more to report

tomorrow

stop that you're wasting the battery

come on man just a sec i need to see

what kind of low-light visibility this

thing has

and you didn't test that before we left

i didn't feel tested if that's what you

mean

come on move around or do something

seriously man i need to see what kind of

how this thing works in low light

situations dude okay killing me steve

this ain't no damn reality tv show i

don't wanna be on that camera more than

necessary

okay fine um so this is

this is camp night one um

night visibility test one so here we see

the campfire

great so that's basically

outside edge of the human eyes vision

sense

okay so

there it is all right that's the end of

uh

night vision field test one

i'm just saying budget cuts and layoffs

are gonna happen you know that's why we

have to distinguish ourselves

you know with something published i mean

at least separate ourselves from

everyone else is not doing field

research

and uh how much field research have you

actually done

i don't know i mean i i mean obviously

if you want to include my undergrad you

know

then grad school oh you know i also did

some field reason

we should probably get some sleep

so this is the start of day two we

haven't found nearly as many signs of

deer as we'd hoped

what's even more strange is that not

only we not found any signs of deer we

really haven't found any signs of any

large mammals in the area

it looks like a game show look at rock

slide

those colors for

looks like it's been here for a little

while yeah i'd say at least a week maybe

two well at least that proves that

there's

some type of large predator in the area

well it's something

okay you see the way its neck is twisted

like that his head is almost backwards

and why would a large predator leave so

much of the carcass behind

that's true tainted mate maybe bad from

the start

yeah it's funny yeah i don't know it's

and it's the only thing we've seen what

could survive out here eating

one goat especially


okay it's the end of day two we decided

to set up camp next to this lake here

i've been putting the coordinates into

the gps

we haven't seen any signs of large

mammals in at least the last

eight hours or so of hiking who's that

who is that

weird i didn't think anybody was up here

this time of year

anyway uh that's the first anything

we've

really seen today hopefully we'll find

more tomorrow

this appears to be some sort of juvenile

mammal

we're gonna take some hair samples back

for analysis

good job wes

this camera seems to turn the sound too

did you hear that it's like the whole

world got silent at once

yeah it's it's weird it's like

everything was

hiding from something yeah

that was weird

okay well this is the end of day two on

our video um we've entered in all the

gps coordinates

and we're both hopeful that tomorrow

will bring uh better results

is it awesome yeah good make sure you

get

all of this a few minutes ago heard some

strange noises in the heels

and then a total silence um

but now you can hear it faintly listen

there it is again goddammit listen

this could be the reason for a lack of

deer overpopulation of wolves now i

don't know how many wolves that sound

like that

man what the [ __ ] else could it be i

don't i don't know

look either way we should break out the

bear mates and take watch

i mean if if that's the reason the deer

population is down i don't see why that

wolf or whatever the hell is out there

wouldn't go for a bite of human

and i'm gonna take the first watch i

can't sleep

yeah i can't either

12 15 exactly and we're still hearing

them noises

and it sounded like it's getting closer

oh man

man it's about that time to get going

how where

you want to hike out in the [ __ ] dark

i mean we know that i-90

is five miles in this direction we have

flashlights

you know we have everything let's go

yeah and break a [ __ ] ankle man


that's insane we can't we can't we can't

do that

in the middle of this we hear all this

[ __ ] we don't know what the hell it

could be

just i don't know man but we can't

we should just we should just tough it

out here and take off at first light

i'm getting out of here come on man

that's where are you gonna go

that's stupid we just gotta just remain

calm all right with no way we know what

it is we're [ __ ] biologists jesus

christ man

just stop

what the hell could it be something that

could [ __ ] us both

up we got the bear base we're fine the

[ __ ] is bear mace gonna do on it

on a watts on a wolf

you're killing me steve

use the [ __ ] satellite

we get them out of here i don't think

it's gonna work up here

what's the number one one

wes get me there less


less god

okay um this is uh steve monterey a

biologist hiking in the woods um

uh we're about five miles north of exit

60.

i know that just get it oh my god

oh my god no those aren't wolves oh god

sir sir are you there

okay wait how is the hair is it looking

good

okay now how about the tits are they

popping out as they should be

okay now don't wash wash me out with all

that you know

just just do it perfect okay okay three

two one university campus officials were

stunned today when the washington state

patrol changed the investigation of

eight missing students from missing

persons investigation to a

murder investigation a spokesperson for

the washington state patrol stated that

in light of new

evidence found at what is now considered

the crime scene

all of the missing students are presumed

dead this goes along with the caretaker

as well as the washington state park

ranger

now the spokesperson could not confirm

nor deny any leads that they have at

this moment

the story broke when friends of the

victims visited their social networking

pages and found disturbing video

and pictures of what could only be

described as the victim's last moments

from there it was brought to the

attention of the state patrol

and the search began now this is just

one of many missing person stories that

has plagued this part of the cascade

mountains

a long history of disappearances has

earned this section of the mountain pass

a dubious reputation

tonight i love it

yeah that's exactly what i needed just a

second let me cut the bottle

hey dean remember the last time we were

driving through the pass okay

oh yeah

well the last time that we were driving

up here

we got followed by a ghost hitchhiker to

the woods what

josh we didn't get here we didn't come

here to get scared okay

we're trying

don't worry we'll be back in a second we

better be

all right so here's the story

so josh and i are coming back from this

college visitation back in high school

and we're coming through the past down

on i-90 and he's got this piece of crap

car that starts making all these crazy

noises

it's a japanese car i mean come on what

do you guys expect yeah it's horrible

so anyway it starts making these crazy

noises but we don't want to stop because

neither of us knows anything about cars

so we just keep going but it gets worse

and worse so finally

we start to pull over on this off ramp

and sure enough it dies

and we can't get it started so we're

caught out in the middle of nowhere

actually that was really close to here

yeah i was only like a mile down the

road

anyway it's pitch black we have no cell

phone reception

so we gotta walk so we start walking

down the road trying to find a gas

station or something

we go about 10 minutes and then all of a

sudden

both of us at the same time feel this

really creepy

feeling like the like cold fingers on

the back of our necks

creepy right same time so we look at

each other we start

moving faster finally we see some lights

down the road for this gas station so we

pretty much sprint the rest of the way

to get to a phone wait what was that

what was what

anyway so we get to the gas station

oh this is the good part we get to the

gas station and

the lady we tell her all about you know

we need transportation we need a tow

for the two of us and she's like wait

what

what do you mean two of us i thought you

i saw three of you

and we're like no there's just two of us

she's like no i swear there was a third

person with you

what happened to that tall man in black

which scared the [ __ ] out of us because

we never saw any man in black

oh god oh my god the power cut

oh

hey heather we're going inside now what

were you looking at anyway

yeah i thought i saw something it was

just the lights reflecting off of

his eyes babe you guys stick around for

my story i've heard of that story before

josh come on i'll hold the door for you

lamas

for your cam all right introducing

stephanie miller

you do now

i left the camera on but i was changing

oh

that that might actually be my fault i'm

sorry i was supposed to be up there

changing i forgot

is something else wrong um the fact that

heather came in and accused me of

flirting with dean

i told you i haven't even done anything

yet

it looks like something to me it could

be more subtle

josh has reception i was just uploading

the pictures we took today

is that thing still on ugh

all right listen up we are establishing

a perimeter between exit 60 and 65.

your rescue team leader has the maps of

your search areas

each team is covering 5 to 10 miles

today based upon the terrain you are

covering there are rangers also in the

area

and they'll be assisting in this rescue

effort i don't need to tell you again

that this is a

search and rescue effort and if we don't

find these

kids soon it will become a body recovery

operation

good luck


we've been assigned section d double

check your walkie talkies

gps monitors collet tags and a video

camera among the equipment

uh we're meeting this site right now

this is j roger

probably just bare they're real common

around here

oh okay

what's wrong with the dogs i don't know

they

the start just put them back in the

truck and leave them

all right in the van

yeah this is ron uh send a team to

assist

that jesus closest get your team up

there to assist it's approximately a

quarter mile due south of your location

roger that

what the [ __ ] happened here

that rock it's got some weird markings

on it

all right get a shot of it i'll document

it later let's move up to the cabin

all right uh the rangers have found

their missing vehicle it is directly

east of the lodge about

two uh 2.7 miles jay

sent a team got it check it out

copy that jesus look at those claw marks

we've arrived at the ranger truck

hey you guys this is ranger johnson in

sector seven

have you made any contact with the

rangers we sent your way

no why we've got large animal sightings

up and down our search lines we're going

to pull back before it gets too dark and

bring in

large light

we need everyone to pull back and

rendezvous at the lodge we're not going

to

risk any more people who aren't equipped

for large predators

large what listen up everyone we're

losing the helicopter and air support

you're reporting heavy cloud you're

never moving in so hurry up and get to

your extraction point so we can drive

you all out of there

let's get out of here yeah yeah okay

we'll head back now

how the hell am i supposed to know how

close the lake we are

we're just close we just came by here

four hours ago

i don't believe this we're search and

rescue and we're lost

you got the map you just push this

button back here

it becomes a big flashlight nice at

least something went right


it's like a wolf out but there's random

lights in the forest hold on



listen ron we can't get anybody on the

radio

where where is everybody hey there's cam

there's lights over there

we're closed we don't know


man


hello hello

get out of here


hey you guys did you see that see what

two lights

kind of reddish think it's some of our

party

where hey people are dying out here

man let's get our bus out of here


shauna oh [ __ ]





all right where are we hey

guys this time you get any stories you

want to hear stories

yeah get any good ones

yeah i know a few and i think you want

to hear them

there's a fine line between truth and

fiction

and sometimes it gets blurred

i wouldn't want to scare the ladies

either really

okay there's stories about these

mountains actually

stories of some incomprehensible

presence

no glimpse out of the corner your eye

a glint or a glare darkness

unsettling stories from these hills and

these roads

there's an indian legend it's hundreds

of years old that

speaks about this mountains it's a

universal theme amongst

all the tribes of the west coast

anyway tell the

ancient spirit that comes down from the

mountain every 30 years or so

and some energy around here that draws

them

i don't know if the stories are monsters

the darker tree but

now this area the cascades is reported

more disappearances

in the last 100 years anywhere else

you know add to that the native legends

of evil

and and and the total absence of

native tribes around here and there's

got to be some truth to that myth

so if you walk around at night stay

close to the light

because you never know where the

darkness may come from

so it's just darkness in the mountains

yeah i liked it what's up guys

that's right yeah

all right i need a beer john

you want to hook me up thanks buddy

ah darkness

let's get it on oh

come on guys that was such a good piece

let's see it we're out of beer so cool

the

missing people and dead bodies

you really want to know huh yeah okay

story i told you earlier it's true

i'm a researcher from the university and

i'm trying to find out why the native

tribes avoided these hills

except for one tribe and they went

missing

trying to find artifacts i'm trying to

find something that'll give me some

guide as to

why they went missing or what their life

was like

could you get that bloody camera out of

my face

strange

marcus stones bad luck comes to those

who touch those things

you can be all right man yeah by the way

i want to thank you for voting

this is an unknown archaeology site

no one in the academic community knows

about it this will fund my research

man it's a long cave


ew what

is that well it was a wolf

wait a minute look there's another one

over there

okay let's get back to the lodge

man wicked


come on

man yeah mosquitoes are eating me alive

out here

what is it

come on let's go

i need to double check her pictures why

well because

the symbols that we saw all right they

represent something that i have never

seen before

not in this area native american symbols

that represent a ward

a what

a ward you know a ward against

evil okay they were used around places

of death and misfortune

to contain the evil that occurred in

those places

and keep away those who might stumble

upon them

yeah i've never seen anything around

here like this

steps downstairs

i'm trying to freak her out oh yeah dude

today we went to these caves we just

stumbled upon them there's all these

native american

paintings on the inside we have some

with like big red eyes you know

hieroglyphics if you're into that nice

do you guys think

it's haunted no it's

all right yeah except we found a big

animal tracks by the old campground so

we decided to leave

big animal tracks how big i don't know i

thought they would bear it first

animal tracks yeah how big

i don't know bigger than my two feet uh

john we're out of beer go grab some more

i went last time yeah but you lost the

bed

fine who's got a flashlight it's almost

dark

uh just take this it's got a light on it

get some good shots i want some of the

sunset

the [ __ ] up yeah great sunset

you can't see anything through the trees

ass


damn it what's up man

we came to help you get the beers

i think we should go

have anyone over here fire's kind of

dying down

where is it it's your wood right here

it's outside man that's the last of it

anybody want to go with yeah i will i

need to smoke anyway

all right fine i'll be right back

sure dean i'd love to go in the hot tub

with you

gee dean thanks for bringing me on this

trip hey no problem heather

just want to show you how much i care

about you

no i think josh might have it




guys

heather yeah

it's really funny guys not gonna work

though

seriously josh if that's you i'm going

to beat the hell out of you


holy [ __ ]

ah smooth whoops

it goes down so easy though come on

dean

i'm going in now dean

dean i'm taking the camera

hey i still want to talk you're not

getting out of this

if dean is doing anything with lacy i

swear

that [ __ ]


how long does it take to chop the

firewood beats me why don't you go

outside and see if he needs help


what the hieroglyphics

from the pictures on your friend's

camera they mean

beware the eyes in the dark you mean

the eyes we saw painted on the walls

what are you talking about well yeah but

but you know not a literal translation

you know at first i thought it was a

ward against

evil for the cave you know with all the

religious overtones and the drawings i

thought

you know it was a religious sign but now

i think it was a war against the evil

in the cave

something about an unstoppable evil

coming from the earth

every 360 moons or so

well yeah it says something happening

something happening

after a large storm

and the eyes in the dark that cannot be

seen

for once you do your life is

this coincides with all the

disappearances up here

yeah i found records of the cascade

railroad mining company that i'm going

to put a railroad line through here

they gave up after a whole lot of

unexplained deaths

let's check the camera

we're just having fun with each other

come on not that serious josh isn't that

fun though

what of course is a prank he's just

screwing with you

he's waiting for one of us to go outside

so we can scare the [ __ ] out of us

probably you

damn it dean

red eyes looking at me from the corner

of the woods how much do you have to

drink nothing i swear

something's out there i think you've

been listening to few too many amanda's

stories

what is that oh god

he's still out there oh my gosh

no

it's a trap all right they want us to

open the door

they're using them as bait turn that

turn the camera light on

this is the prank i pray that it is and

that someone will find this

we've been in an attack and we don't

know what it is

we think dean is dead

hieroglyphics refer to them as the eyes

that's all i've

worked out so far


the only ward against the eyes is stone

there's still that one a stone

what stone he fell on one in the cave

and put it away

i think he put it in my room somewhere

oh [ __ ]

okay we need to get that

hey you guys what about josh and seth

oh no okay we are quietly going to go

downstairs

no one break off and we'll go and go

okay oh that'll do it go find that stone

okay give me the kid

we need the light i'll go with her all

right bring that camera along with us

look make it quick okay get back to the

living room when you finish because

that's the safest place here all right

and make it quick

lucy get back upstairs right now no

go

what the hell man

you too get yourself upstairs now get

dressed

now get the hell out of


did you find here oh my god

oh my god


yes


we still even know where heather is

she's gone

or barricaded in a room like us

do you think that they're all dead

john you okay


so what do we do now how long do you

think it's going to keep him out there

all right here's what we know they're

big

they have teeth they're hunting us

anders dead dean's dead josh is dead

heather's probably dead

us instead we know that guns don't hurt

them under shot one it only stopped him

for a little bit

okay so the only thing we think that can

stop them is the idol in dean's room

we can't go in dean's room they're right

outside i can make a break

no what if they get you too

oh my god
