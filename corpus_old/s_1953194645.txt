[MONKEY SCREECHES]

[HIGH-PITCHED GROWLING]

WOMAN: Poor baby.
It's a tough way to start out.

We'll give her 50-50.

What do you think, doc?

I say she'll make it.
Maybe,

with the help
of a future veterinarian.

Once she's off the bottle, of course.
Oh, I know, I know.

So, cub, what's
your name gonna be?

Careful, Val. She can't become a pet.

Mom, give me a little credit.
I'm practically a professional already.

You're practically in love already.

I know that look.

We might as well name her.
She's gonna be here for...

For as short a time as possible.
Until I place her, right, Val?

Well, she still needs a name.

Call her Elsa. What else?

Elsa?


Elsa. Of course.

Elsa.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

Youth, uh... Youth Mark eteer.

Here. Take this. Okay.

Hey. How are you?

[PAPER RUSTLES]

Thanks, Chris.

Come on, you wanna help me?
Help me out. I'm a vet.

WOMAN: Hey, watch it!
Come on.

Please don't touch me.
Come on.

Taxi, taxi.

All I want's a quarter, man.
Come on.

Check this out, man.
Step up to the store.

Check this out.

Hey, Marcus, what are
you selling today?

Hey, little sister, check this out.
I got this yesterday.

I like this gold one.
How much is it?

Hey, check the hot tops.

That's my brother, Rand.
Youth Mark eteer.

That's Wall Street for beginners.

What's for dinner?
I'm starving.

It's Tuesday.
That's you, Rand.

Oh, uh, spaghetti. Gina, give me a hand,
will you? I'll help you out tomorrow.

Yeah, sure.

Tough day?
No. The day was fine.

I just wish for once I could get into a cab without
a bunch of psychotics waiting in line to mug me.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

GINA: Oop, I'll get it.
RAND: You're just being paranoid, Dad.

I would rather be paranoid
than be accosted.

Yeah, uh, speaking of money...
DR. THOMPSON: Do we have to?

Here, Dad. This is for you.

Would you mind if I took
dance lessons three times a week?

Aren't you overdoing it?
GINA: I don't think I'm doing it enough.

Yeah, also if I could borrow, like, $700,
I could do my newsletter right here at home.

DR. THOMPSON: I don't believe this.
RAND: What?

The Rosebrook Research Institute.

That one where you stayed up
for, like, three nights in a row?

Writing the grant proposal.
It just came through.

That's cool, Dad.
Congratulations.

Maybe I can subsidize the extra
lesson with your new grant check.

Yeah, listen, uh, Jerry's newsstand wants to
distribute for me, but I don't think it's necessary-

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you don't understand.

This underwrites my research
for two years.

Is this oregano or thyme?
Oh, that's oregano.

So, which means, boys and girls, we
will be leaving for Africa in two weeks.

Africa?
Africa?

That's where I'm doing the research.

Dad, no.
That's impossible.

Now, wait a minute.
It's only two years.

How many kids do you know
get a chance to go to Africa?

Wait a minute. No, Dad.
Timing here is everything, okay?

You want to go to Africa, that's fine.
You can be my guest.

As for me, I think I'm speaking
for Gina here also,

we got plenty to do right here
in the good old U.S. of A.

There's no way I'm going to Africa.

Rand.

Giraffes.

I've seen giraffes.

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGU AGE]

This is my wife, Frances,
and our son, Nik Nik.

How do you do, Frances? I'm David.
FRANCES: Hi.

Hello, Nik Nik.
NIK NIK: Hello.

This is my daughter, Gina.
Hi.

DR. THOMPSON: Rand?
GINA: Nice to meet you.

That's my son, Rand.

Papa says we're gonna take good care of
you so you don't get into too much trouble.

DR. THOMPSON: Well, thank you
very much, Nik Nik.

FRANCES: I hope you had a good trip.
GINA: It was a long, long way.

Who are you?
I'm, uh, the Easter Bunny.

I don't think so.
No?

I'll show you to your rooms.
Uh, no, thank you.

I think I'm gonna find
my own place to bunk.

By my calculations, that barn over
there is the closest one to America.

Uh, Rand, in that barn-
It's okay. Let him go.

[RAND GROANS]


RAND:
Oh, no.

Okay.

All right. Oh, no.

Easy, easy there.
There you go. All right. Yeah.

Boy, you're big.

There you are.

Sorry. She likes this barn.

That is a lion.
Yes, it is.

It's all right. Elsa's quite tame.

I'm Val Porter. Mother and I live down
the hill. You must be the new neighbors.

Yes. I'm, uh, Dr. Thompson.

These are my children,
Gina and Rand.

It's all right. Nearly everyone's
a little frightened at first.

Lady, it's, uh...
It's gonna take a lot more

than a big pussycat to frighten me.

Obviously.

I think she likes you.

RAND: Who, the ice maiden
or the man-eater?

Where was she?

In the barn, scaring
the new people.

Dr. Thompson wonder
where I was?

He didn't ask about you at all.

There was a daughter and a son,
and for some weird reason,

Elsa got an immediate
crush on the son.

Uh-oh. Jealous?

Elsa can like
whomever she pleases.

I meant the other way around.

Oh, no. He's not my type at all.

Thinks he's something special.
I can't stand that kind of arrogance.


[MUSIC TURNS OFF]

[ANIMAL CRIES]

Got to admit that was cool.

So I guess you were thinking
of settling out here.

Yeah, I'd like to.

Well, I don't know
about this, Rand.

There could be wild animals
or snakes at night.

I'm not bothering
anybody out here,

and I'll keep the place clean.

Well, oh, okay.

I wish you wouldn't separate
yourself from us. That's all.

I'd prefer it out here. If you
tell me to go back inside...

I'm not telling you you have to.
It's not an order, just a wish.

FRANCES: Is something wrong
with American fries?

Oh, no. They're perfect.
They're wonderful.

Could I fix you a sandwich or a salad?
Nope. Not a thing, Frances.

But we'll do better by your food
when we've rested. Promise.

Okay.

It's incredible, isn't it?
Mm.

Mm-hm.

Look, Gina, I know this isn't easy.

Things will get better when
Rand comes around a little.

I don't know
what's gotten into him.

Gina?

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]

[MUSIC DISTORTS, THEN STOPS]

Oh, man.


Hey, pussycat.

How's Winny doing?

She won't eat unless I feed her.
Oh.

Winny would make a nice pet.

Well, I have a pet, on
permanent loan, apparently.

No, Val. You're keeping
a lion for George Luello.

GEORGE: Good morning.
Speaking of whom.

Good morning, George.
Good morning.

Val, I need you to
fill this out, please.

It's the keeper's report.

A summary of Elsa's behavior and
habits while she's been in your care.

You're taking her away?
Not now, Val.

But it's coming.
You know that.

Now comes the hard part.


Good morning.

So, uh...

this is your place? This is your
barn? This is where you live, huh?

Well...

I'm just...

I'm just gonna get dressed.

I'm gonna go in the kitchen...

and have some breakfast.

All right. Just take it easy,
all right? I'll just, uh...

I'll go out this way.

What is the problem?

[GUN SHOOTS]

What?

Good morning.
I see your watchdog alerted you.

You're trying to say that she
was protecting me from that thing?

Egyptian cobra. Very deadly.

What happened?

Is that snake poisonous?
No. Dad, it's fine. Really.

I think you're gonna have to forget
about sleeping in the barn, Rand.

Dad, it's nothing. Forget it-
No, it's okay,

Dr. Thompson, it's all right.

Elsa is the very best protection you
can find. She doesn't miss a thing.

And I don't mind her staying
out here with your son,

since, for some reason,
she likes it.

Good girl.

Stay here. Good girl.

Ready, Nik Nik?
Yeah, I'm ready.

FRANCES: All right.
VAL: Bye.

Bye.
NIK NIK: Bye-bye.

Ah.

I'm from Greystone Academy.
I'm here to see-

I know, I know. Actually, you're here
early. I didn't expect you till tomorrow.

GINA: Greystone Academy?
RAND: What is this, Dad?

Uh, yes, I meant to discuss this with you
earlier, but with everything happening,

I thought we'd settle down a little.
Greystone's is the best school in the country.

Where is it?
It's in the capital.

The capitalâ€™s two hours from here.

You're shipping us off to some
boarding school halfway across Africa?

I am not shipping- Look, this is
the way things are done here.

Greystone's happens to be
the finest school in the country here.

And I think you're awful lucky
to get in.

Do you hear that, Gina?
You feel lucky?

Now wait a minute. Don't start now.
No, well, I certainly feel lucky.

You know, I feel lucky.
I feel very lucky.

We've just been subjected to another
one of Dad's dead-end ultimatums.

"You're going to Africa. "
No discussion.

"You're leaving your friends, your home, everything
you care about for two years. " No discussion.

" Now it's off to some boarding school
you know nothing about. " No discussion.

Now, hold on, Rand. I did mean
to discuss this with you.

You know, the thing is, you haven't discussed
anything with us. That's the problem, okay? Because...

Look, Gina and I want
a chance to be adults.

We wanna have something to say about where we
live, how we live. But no, you treat us like babies.

Why are we in Africa, Dad?
Because we sat down and discussed

the pros and cons
like three equals? No.

We're not equals.
I'm the parent, you're the kid.

Real- Okay, that's good.
That's real good. All right.

Well, all right. I've been arbitrary.

But we're here. There's nothing
we can do about it. We are in Africa.

We are in Africa, Rand. And that's
the most appropriate school.

And that's where I want you to go.
I've thoroughly researched this.

Well, where does Val go?
And Nik Nik?

Where are those kids going?

To Shamba School.
The only one here.

Yes, well, it's not anything
you'd really be accustomed to.

Is it a good school?
Shamba School is a very good school

for Val and Nik Nik.

Well, if it's good enough for Val
and Nik Nik, it's good enough for me.

Count me in.

Where's the school?

Jomo says it's about two miles
that way on the left.

You better get started. You're already
late. I'll be by later to check it out.

Two miles? You could zip us down
there in a minute and a half.

Well, I'm sorry, but I'm late too.
And you could use the exercise.

After all, if it's good enough
for Val and Nik Nik...

You see that? That's right.

You had to throw that in, didn't you? Now we're
gonna be hearing that every time we turn around.

"That's right, if it's good enough
for Val and Nik Nik... "

Look, at least I made something happen
instead of just standing there, complaining.

Okay, you know, um...

Hello.

[SPEAK IN FOREIGN LANGU AGE]

Miss Porter.

Eleanor.

Dr. Thompson.
David.

Actually, I met your daughter.
Twice already.

[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGU AGE]

Uh, this way.

Okay.

ELEANOR: As you can see,
we get by on very little.

On the other hand, you'll be happy to know
we do have a wealth of viruses to study.

[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGU AGE]

Their temperature
stays over 103,

and their surface symptoms,
well, they're all over the map.

I'm going to need
blood samples.

Dr. Thompson, I'm afraid you're gonna be on your
own for a while. I've got to see to my patients.

The lab is just through there.
Such as it is.

[THOMPSON CLEARS THROAT]

Oh, that's the, uh, lab?

Yes.
Uh-huh.

I'm afraid no one had the time
to fix it up for you.

RAND: That's the school?
Oh, neat.

It looks just like play school.

Yeah, be careful. By lunchtime, they'll
have you making lamps and billfolds

out of Popsicle sticks.

Doctor, progress?

Officially the viral samples
are the same,

but around the edges,

there is a difference.

I just can't get a clear view
with this piece of...

antiquity.

Excuse me.

Uh, well, you could try contacting Jim Willery
in the capital. He might dig something up.

There's no money
in the grant for supplies.

Maybe on the strength of your name.
Dr. David Thompson in Africa.

It's been raising eyebrows
everywhere.

I'm a little surprised myself.

No one knew African viruses
were a special interest for you.

A virus...

is a virus.

And as a place
for my family to live,

Africa was very appealing.

Excuse me.

Oh, uh, excuse me.
Could I have one word with you?

That's your domain in there,

and I know it must feel
like I'm invading.

But can I assure you
that's not my intention.

Selena Wilkinson,
born and raised nearby,

had been doing brilliant research
here and in Zaire.

For years, she's been praying for the
kind of grant they simply handed you.

It would have been the
culmination of a lifetime's work,

not just a free safari
for some children.

Miss Porter...

I am sorry about your
friend's disappointment.

I came to Africa to work
and to work hard.

If my having a double motive
disqualifies me in your book, well,

that's going to make it
a little bit tough for both of us,

but that is something that
you will have to live with.

So as Africans, how do you feel?

Do you think the power should lie
with any one nation?

Well, ma'am, it seems to me that no one
country should control nuclear power.

Uh-huh, and how would
you have it be, Neuru?

The way I see it is that
the United Nations should take over

and say where it can be used
and, I suppose, where it can't.

Let's hear from one
of our newcomers.

Rand.

What's your opinion?

Sitting out here in the middle of nowhere,
I don't think you need to be too concerned.

Nobody's gonna waste
a warhead on this place.

You will find, Rand, that out here
in the middle of nowhere,

we don't see ourselves
as third-class. In fact,

we have the same rights and responsibilities
as Americans in the biggest cities.

That's another world, Miss Luello.

Oh, yes. Yes, it is, Rand.

Miss Luello got her MA
at Columbia.

And how long have you been
in Africa for, American boy?

What? One day? And already
you know everything about us?

That's enough, Neuru.
Okay.

I won't waste any more
of your time or mine.

Rand, sit down, please.

Rand.

Sit down.

Dr. Thompson, I'm, uh... I'm finishing
up early. Would you like some help?

Oh, no. No, I'm fine. Thanks.

I'm going to Vailâ€™s, okay?

NIK NIK: Bye.
GIRLS: Bye.

Good. Now it's just us men.

I've got things to do,
okay, Nik Nik?

I'll help you.
Oh, yeah?

How can you help me?

Well, I'll tell you never to stand
on an anthill. They bite.

Oh, no. Okay.
Get them off. Get them off.

Let me help you up.

You see, I'm a good guy
to have around.

RAND: Good guy to have around,
but you can't beat me up the hill.

You want to race?
Wanna go? Good. Come on.




Elsa.

George.

Yes, Magilla.

You know, it's not so smart to
have her hanging around your goats.

Oh, come on, George.
She doesn't hurt them.

Mm-mm. Elsa's a lion.

She doesn't act much like it now,
but one day she will.

Relax, George. She's wonderful.
Yes, Magilla, but she's still a lion.

Still working?

No. I'm... I'm playing chess.

Since when are you
afraid of Elsa?

It's dinnertime. She's hungry,
and I'm little.

Well, I don't have
any food, girl.

What is she doing, Nik Nik?
What does she want?

She likes you.

RAND:
Likes me, really?

You're lucky.

Hey.

Hey there. Yeah.

You're friendly. Hey.

NIK NIK:
Rand! Rand!

Rand!

He's not down there.

Well, we should have left
10 minutes ago.

All right, go on ahead,
and I'll send him down.

RAND: Hey, come on. Show some respect.
That's my friend you're insulting.

Okay, run up there, all right?

One, two, three.

You're a showoff.

You also have four legs.

I thought you were fast.

What happened?


Rand, where have you been?

I, uh, took a hike.
Actually, Elsa took me on a hike.

Actually, you skipped school.
That is unacceptable.

Dad, this school is
a complete waste of time.

Oh, no, no. You could have
gone to Greystone's.

Greystone wouldn't
have been any better.

Nothing would be better
for you right now, Rand.

I know you, and from now on, you will
attend every class unless I excuse you.

Dad, this is not-
No, no.

There is not a negotiation here.

If you skip again,
you'll move back into the house.

I will take away your allowance,
and I will take away that computer.

Oh, really? Okay, you know what? That's
fine with me. Just go ahead and take it.

The freaking batteries are failing. The stupid
African plugs won't fit it. Just go ahead and take it.

You used to be a pretty nice guy
when Mom was still alive.

What was that?
Nothing.

No. I'd like to know
what you said.

I said...

you used to be a pretty nice guy
when Mom was alive.

That's what I said.

RAND:
School, school, school, school.

You know, back home
I liked school. Here?

Well, I learn more fooling around with
you than I would a month in that classroom.

My father and his twisted ideals.
Never knew your father, did you?

Or your mother? No?

My mother...
My mother was something else.

She sure was. She, uh,
treated me like a person.

Elsa, stay!

Why can't she come
to school with us?

She's gotten too big. She gets
into trouble, and she scares people.

Papa says it's time for the zoo.
Please don't discuss that.

Good morning.
Good morning.

We seem to have gotten off on the
wrong foot. I think I said some things

that were unprofessional.

Oh, there's no need to apologize.
I wasn't apologizing.

Miss Porter, I know you resent
my being here.

There's no need
to refer to it any longer.

I am perfectly capable of being civil,
as I hope you are.

There's no reason that we can't
work together. And speaking of work,

I need blood samples of viral patients
every morning and every evening.

And if there are any survivors from
past viral epidemics in this area,

I want to test them, but most of all, somehow,
somewhere, I've got to get a 20th century microscope.

Dr. Thompson, I'm very interested in
your research, and I'm very anxious

to help you in any way I can.
But there's some confusion here.

I am not a part of your grant.
I am not your assistant.

I'm a nurse practitioner,
and my job is to run that clinic.

I think your work is important
and exciting, and I was...

Well, I was hoping to get off
to a fresh start today.

[THUNDER CRASHES]

The end of the 19th century saw a
large expansion in African colonization.

Which of the European powers
held colonies here?

Great Britain.
BO Y: France.

GIRL: Belgium.
Any others?

Rand?
Germany.

Yes. And who were the leaders
of those countries? Anyone?

Queen Victoria in England.

France? Belgium? Germany?

Rand?

Napoleon III in France,
King Leopold in Belgium,

Kaiser Wilhelm I in Germany.
But Bismarck had the real juice.

Thank you. I believe that's lunch.

Rand, could I have
a word with you, please?

I'm glad to have a student
like you with us, Rand.

I just wish you didn't
resent being here.

I answer when you call on me,
and I stay awake.

The minimum. I want more.

You could make
a big contribution if you try.

I'm going back to the States soon.

I've got a lot happening there,
maybe even a job.

What is it that you can do there
that you can't do here?

Oh, oh, uh...

Well, I can hang with my friends.
Take in a band at the Dub Club,

go to the museum, the symphony,
publish The Mark eteer.

The Mark eteer?

Wall Street for my generation. The old guys think the
stock market's some kind of big deal, but it's not.

Well, you make
investments yourself?

Well, Dad says not till I'm 18, so
it's play money. But I'm cleaning up.

I've always hoped
for a school paper.

That's not the same.

Think about it.

That's really good.
Oh, it's just a rough sketch.

I've seen that look
in her eyes a few times.

Yeah. I bet you have.

Listen, Val, I'm not trying to make
her hang out with me or anything.

I know. Thanks.
She's your lion.

No, she's not. No,
she's not mine or anybody's.

But I appreciate the thought.

Oh, here.

No, I don't want it.
You keep it.

Thanks. I will.


Sorry. Was I singing?
And dancing.

Yeah. Nik Nik says you're going
to be a professional.

Well, I said that,
but I changed my mind.

I mean, there's gotta be
more to life than practice, right?

Maybe.
Maybe.

Here. Listen.

This is cool music.

Rand.

Miss Luello tells me that you are
thinking of starting a school paper?

I said I'd think about it.
And have you?

Have I what?
Thought about it?

You see, I'm interested in the school
paper myself. And since it was your idea,

you are in charge.
That's if you are interested.

But if you are not...

[TYPEWRITER TYPING]

Will everyone in school get a copy?
If they want it.

Here, try this paragraph again.
For free?

First issue, yes.
The first issue is always free.

Why are you calling it
The Termite?

That is the function of a good paper,
to eat away rotten, old-age ideas.

Like a termite.

RAND: So come on. Get your copy of
it right here, right now. Here it is.

MISS LUELLO:
The Termite?

I'll admit the title
is a bit corny.

I had something less
controversial in mind.

Oh, well, "controversial"
is Rand's middle name.

Although, I will say he's
outdone himself this time.

You asked me to publish
a school paper.

I asked you to think about it.
I thought about it, and I did it.

All by yourself.

No, I got Neuru involved.
Typing your essays.

No. You see, his stuff was
a bit naive. No offence, Neuru.

His "stuff," as you call it,
is just as valid as yours.

Maybe I misjudged your editorial
abilities or your maturity.

So I guess you'll have
to expel me now.

Mrs. Luello is trying to help you.

I would like you to try again,
but for this next issue-

Next issue? No. No way. I quit.
Come on.

No. No, I mean it. For the next
two years, just count me out.

Hey, hey, Rand.
That's enough. Rand!

Dr. Thompson. Dr. Thompson,
Nik Nik found this on Rand's bed.

"Since it seems that I'm stuck
in Africa for two years,

I would like to make
the best use of my time.

I've read there is a new
anthropological dig on Lake Mizalacausie

that is hiring workers.

I'm going to apply for a job. Will
keep you advised. " Lake Mizalacausie?

Lake Uzelazie. Dr. T, no one hikes
there from here. Rand will be lost.

ELEANOR: Dr. Thompson?
Oh, for God sakes!

ELEANOR: Dr. Thompson?
DR. THOMPSON: Yes, what? What?

Did Rand leave a note?
Yes.

He's gone off to God knows
where. Don't tell me that-

Apparently, Val saw his note.
She thinks that Elsa's followed him.

And now Vailâ€™s gone too.
What are we gonna do?

I'll call George Luello.
He has a big truck. Come.

Let's go.
This is unbelievable.

Okay.

South.

West. Okay.

Elsa!

Elsa!

Elsa!


I know a few places we can look now, but I
don't expect to find anybody before tomorrow.

We'll keep in touch.
DR. THOMPSON: I want to go with you.

I appreciate how you feel,
but we work better on our own.

Too many people will slow us down.
There must be something we can do.

Please, stay here.
We'll find them.

[ENGINE STARTS]

RAND:
Got it going.


Elsa, that better be you.

Hey, how are you?
What are you doing out here?

What are you doing?
Are you out here looking for me?

Oh, God. Oh, come here.

Oh, I've never been so glad
to see anybody in my entire life.

What are you doing here?
Oh, I was following Elsa,

and she was tracking you.
Oh.

You know, this isn't the way people
usually go to Lake Mizalacausie.

I figured that out. It looked
like a shortcut on the map.

You're also walking in a circle,
and it definitely takes longer that way.

Don't feel badly. People get
lost out here all the time.

There's lots of little box canyons
and landmarks that look alike.

So, bwana, do you know
how to get out of here?

I didn't say that.


Elsa!
No, Val, don't go out there.

No.
No. No. She'll be killed.

Val, she's a lion, okay?
She's got instincts too.

VAL:
It's not enough.

I'm sure. Come here.

Come on.

[SQU AWKING]

Elsa's back.

VAL:
Mm-hm. She came in at dawn.

So are you gonna go
to Lake Mizalacausie?

No, I don't think so.

It's different
now that you're here.

What I mean is, they'll probably
be looking for you and Elsa.

Me and Elsa? What about you?
Okay, I started it,

but I just think we should stick
together. Find our way back.

Yeah. I didn't mean
to mess up your plans.

I just couldn't let Elsa
run off like that.

It's fine. It's all right.
I didn't want to go that badly.

I was just angry.

Are you still angry?

Val, can you keep a secret?

I'm starting to like it here.

If this is the Balabi River,

then we're somewhere in here.

And home is that away.

Oh, boy.

Hey, Elsa, come on. Come on in too.
Elsa! Come on.

Come on, girl.
Hey, come on.

Oh, well.

This fire is still warm.
Somebody was here.

Yeah, this could have been Elsa's
spot. Maybe they're together.

If it's them.

Tea leaves. Val took
the Thermos with her.

She always has pepper cupper.
Her dad's a Brit.

Unbelievable. They're having a tea
party while we're sick with worry.

At least they found each other.

Look, their tracks go that way,
and the river's down there.

If they made it to the river,
Val knows how to get home.

Well, that is if Rand
wants to go home.

Difficult days?

Well...

you know. Rand will never forgive me
for taking him away from his friends

and his school and his
newsletter and this and that.

Give him time.

Who wouldn't want to trade
the city in for all this?

Randolph Everett Thompson,
for one. Thank you.

Sounds like a pretty unique fellow.

Val pretends not to like him,
but she talks about him all the time.

Well, no one can tell
Rand what to do.

His mother...

well, she was
much better with him.

I really haven't been able
to reach him lately, since...

You know, he resists just
about every single thing I say.

I'm starting to
second-guess myself.

Makes me think I'm
a pretty lousy father.

Would it make you feel any better if I
told you he sounds like a normal teenager?

Thanks. Look, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to dump all my problems on you.

No, no, no, it has a familiar ring.
Remember, I've got one too.

Oh, God!
What?

I bet they spent
the night together.

Oh, well, Eleanor, if you're suggesting that
my son would take advantage of your daughter...

Please, David. It could have been
the other way around.

Oh, boy.

[VAL SCREAMING]

Go! Go!

Come on. Come on.


[ROAR ECHOING]

DR. THOMPSON: Thank you, Mr. Luello,
and I'm sorry for the trouble.

I'm just glad everyone's back
in one piece.

Thank you, George.
Don't do that again, huh?

Val...

Is that okay if I go to your house?
ELEANOR: Well, sure.

Dad, I'll be at Vailâ€™s, okay?
Just, uh, be home for dinner.

Hold on, Rand.

You and I have to have
a little talk.

Now, could you please
explain to me

why you went off
on this mission from hell?

I was angry, and it was stupid.
And I admit it was dumb.

Yes, it was dumb. It was dumb.
It was reckless and dumb.

You're very lucky
there are no serious injuries.

Very, very lucky.

You've made your point.
Rand, what are you doing?!

I don't understand
why you're behaving this way.

I guess I was wrong to drag you out
here to this terrible, horrible place.

Look at it. Terrible!

I'm sorry.

You're not to leave the grounds
unless I give you permission.

Not even down the hill?

Well, down the hill's okay, I guess.

Thank you.


MAGILLA:
What is it? What's wrong?

Oh.

You again.

No.

Get away! Go away!

Hey!

Hey!


Is Elsa okay?

She ran off as soon as
the shooting started.

The other lion wasn't so lucky.
Sorry, Val, but it's time now.

What are you saying? You're gonna send Elsa to
a zoo because some male lion was pestering her?

She's attracting them.
It's a dangerous situation.

If the goatherd hadn't killed the lion,
the lion might have killed the goatherd.

Now, I can't wait
till somebody gets hurt.

I'm coming by for Elsa before dark.
You see that she's there.

Ondine, sorry for the disruption.

I'm sorry I ever started all this.

I feel like letting every one
of them go right now.

They would die, Val.

They'd die.

What you do for them is important.
You think so?

But it's too hard when it's time
to say goodbye.

Come on, Victor.

Before somebody wants you
for their stupid zoo.

Come on, Elsa. Up you go.

How long untie she goes?

A few days.
Can we come and see her?

Of course.

This doesn't feel right.

Well, do you want to
go see her or not?

I don't know.

It might just make things worse.

It's so weird seeing her
in a cage like this.

Mm.

Wait.

Wait a minute, Val...

RAND: Miss Luello,
what are you doing here?

I live here. George is my brother.
Oh.

I take it you've come to see Elsa?

Uh, no. Actually we've come by
to see Mr. Luello.

We'd like to release Elsa
back into the wild.

Oh. Well, you'd better come in.

The odds are very bad. Isn't it
best for Elsa to live in a zoo?

And what kind of life is that?
Safe, secure.

Like a prison?
She deserves a chance to be free.

And we're willing
to work with her.

Do you two have any idea
what you're getting yourselves into?

Do you know how Elsa got
her name?

Your brother named her
after the original Elsa,

the lion that the lady raised-
Joy Adamson, yes.

Have you read her book?
No.

Before embarking on such a task,
I suggest you do your homework.

And believe me, before asking
Mr. Luello for anything,

you'd best be well-prepared.
Good luck and good reading.

Thanks.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

The answer is no.

And I don't appreciate your stunt
with the book.

It will just give them wild ideas.

At least they can prepare
a proper case.

There is no case. That
situation was one in a million.

This lion cannot survive
in the wild,

and we can't have her
running around loose anymore.

Her only hope is the zoo.

George, how can you be so sure
she won't survive on her own?

Doesn't she at least
deserve a chance?

All this to do about one lion. I'm
responsible for millions of animals, Ondine.

Why are you making such
a fuss about Elsa's future?

It's not Elsa's future
that concerns me.

RAND: Val and I have given this a
lot of careful thought, and we believe

that Elsa has a legitimate chance
of survival in the wild

if she is properly and systematically
introduced to the elements.

Yes. My staff and I cover more
than two million acres of wildlife.

We don't have so much time
for " properly and systematically. "

We're only asking for a minimum
of support from your staff.

Rand and I plan to do
all the training ourselves.

And who's going to train you?

Well, wait a minute. Joy
Adamson wasn't a trained expert.

She loved her Elsa. She did the
best that she could, and it worked.

We have the benefit of her experience. We
don't even have to make all the same mistakes.

No, because you'll be making
plenty new ones of your own. Come.

I want to show you something.

All right. This is Elsa's normal diet,
meat with kibble,

and this is what she'll be eating
in the wild, if she's lucky.

All that proves is that she goes
for the easy stuff first.

She would starve in the wild.

VAL: No. She'd learn from the
other lions, be part of a pride.

More like they'd kill her.
She belongs in a zoo.

Val and I have made scientific observations in the
field that contradict your position, Mr. Luello.

Scientific observations?

While we were lost,

we had a chance to spend some time
with Elsa in a natural environment.

She didn't kill her food.
No, but she did fit in.

And we think she found
a boyfriend.

We see offshoot scientific
implications to this endeavor.

Okay, one, how to influence animal
behavior, heredity versus environment,

conditioning by kindness
or harshness.

Offshoot scientific implications?

Miss Luello said she'd give us credit.
I did?

For special projects.
Uh, yes, I did say that.

You gotta admit,
this is pretty special.

Good try, but the answer is still no.

Well, they are right, you know?
I beg your pardon?

Well, there's no logical reason why
Elsa can't be successfully integrated.

You see, the Adamson's experiment
changed everyone's thinking.

I mean, since then,
there's been countless examples.

Lions, wolves, even condors.

Mr. Luello,
this is obviously your call.

But speaking strictly as a scientist
and based on scientific evidence,

Rand and Val have every reason
to expect success

if they're given a chance.

I'll give them two weeks.
Three. Please.

All right. Three weeks.
Yes. Thank you.

Thanks, Mom.
Yeah, thank you.

Uncommonly bright children.
Yes.

Impressive improvisational skills.

That's one way of putting it.

Like father, like son.

Hi. Hi, girl.
Hey.

Elsa!
Hey, Elsa, come here.

Come here.

VAL:
Hey, girl.

RAND:
Welcome back.

Now comes the hard part.


No, Elsa.

She's hungry.

She's supposed to be hungry.

I think she's starving.

Maybe she is, but tomorrow
she's gonna hunt her own dinner.

Will she know how to do that?

If she's hungry enough,
her natural instincts will take over.

How do you know that?

It's in the book.


VAL: I should have let George
take her when she was still a baby.

You don't mean that. Think
of what you would have missed.

Think what I would have missed.
Fine for us, but all wrong for Elsa.

I think she likes
the life that she's had,

and she'll be okay once she
gets into the real wild country.

She won't be ready.
Val, you're being so negative.

VAL:
I love her. That's all.

JOMO: Bye, everyone.
VAL: Bye.

GINA: See you later.
RAND: Yeah, see you later.

GINA: Good luck.
RAND: You coming, Gina?

Oh, thanks, but I have other plans.
Other plans?

You just- Never mind.

All right.

See you guys tonight, huh?

Bye.
Bye.

ALL: Bye.
RAND: Goodbye.

Bye, guys.

Come on, girl.
Come on.

VAL: Come on, girl.
RAND: Come on. Come on.

VAL:
Good girl.

Good girl.


Why you doing that, Papa?

Something new, Nik Nik.

Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

Yeah! Good girl!
Yes!

She didn't kill it herself, though.

But she stalked it,
and she brought it in.

DR. THOMPSON:
And she is eating it.

GEORGE: True, but Jomo won't be around
with his rifle next time to help her.

DR. THOMPSON: He won't need to be.
I wish we had more time.

Nope. Enough's enough.
She'll be ready.

Saturday.
VAL AND RAND: Saturday.

VAL:
Right, Mr. Luello.


I believe you're looking
for volunteers.

Uh, well...

Your field is virological research?
Yes.

Well, I have some small knowledge
of the field myself.

I'm certainly qualified to take some blood
samples and provide you with assistance.

Dr. Thompson, isn't it?

Yes, and you are?
I'm Selena Wilkinson.

Oh.
Yes.

Yes.
I believe Eleanor has spoken of me.

Yeah.
If you don't want my help,

believe me, I'll understand.

But I wanted to offer it anyway.

You see, I've been sitting
at home for a month,

pouting over your good fortune,

and there's something
wrong with that.

If I were in your shoes and
qualified help were around the corner,

I'd wonder why I
didn't step forward.

Well, I really don't know what to say.

Well, say yes, doctor.

Oh, yes, please.
I mean, of course.

Good. Robert, in here.

This should come in handy.

Yes. Yes, indeed.

That thing suits you.

Well, I wouldn't be caught
dead riding this in the city.

From Future Business
Leaders of America.

Yeah. Let's see.

Yeah.

Collins. Collins Brokerage.

The apprenticeship. I got it.
They want me in the office on Monday.

Wow, an airplane ticket.
This outfit doesn't fool around, huh?

Room and board, a salary.
Dad, this is an incredible opportunity!

Sure sounds like one,
if that's what you want.

It's okay?

Thank you. Thank you.

Hey, uh, what about
your friend there?

Elsa. Well, I'm gonna miss
the final release, of course, but...

Come on, Elsa!
She's gonna be all right.

Dad, this is
an incredible opportunity.

This is a once in a lifetime chance.
Come on, girl!

Geri, I didn't plan it
this way, okay?

I didn't want to come
to Africa in the first place.

Will you come back?

Yeah. Yeah, I'll come back
to see, uh...

You know, to see Dad
and Gina. You.

But not Elsa. She won't be here.

No.

What about Val?

Well, I'll come and see Val too.

No, I mean, have you told her?

It's on my agenda.

Big day for Homer, huh?

His idea of freedom
is the palm of my hand.

Listen, uh, about
tomorrow and Elsa.

Uh...

Something's come up...

and I can't go.

What?

I have...

I have an incredible chance to
intern at a brokerage back home.

They sent me an airplane ticket
and everything.

I guess this is goodbye for now.

I'll write you.

I hope you'll write me and tell me
how things work with Elsa.

Elsa will be
in the Rotterdam Zoo.

RAND:
But it's all set up with George.

You and I were going
to free Elsa together.

I can't believe how wrong
I was about you.

You had me completely fooled.

I thought you really cared...

about Elsa.

I do. I do care, but this is a dream
that I had long before I met you or Elsa.

And if you're suggesting
that I pass this up-

I'm not suggesting anything.

Maybe this is hard for someone
like you to understand.

That's right. It's hard for someone
like me to understand. Goodbye, Rand.

Val.
There's nothing to say.

Just go on home
and have your dream.

I want to forget
I ever knew you.

Rand?

Something wrong?

Yeah, it's Val.

Oh.

She must be upset.

Yeah, she is.

You know...

I've been thinking about this...

and Collins Brokerage is okay.

It's not top of the line
by any means.

And if you're serious about this, I
don't want you settling for second best.

Maybe the timing's wrong.

No, you're right about Collins.

The market is down a little bit.
Yeah, mm-hm.

You can always reapply in summer.
Yeah. I suppose I could sign up.

You know, I hate to go
back on my word, Rand.

But...

I'm going to have to insist
that you pass this up.

If you're insisting, then...

I'm sorry, Rand, but I do.

I understand.

So, uh...

I guess this means that
I'll be here for Elsa's release.

Oh, I guess so.

I, uh...

I don't suppose there's any
chance that you could come with us?

Oh, uh, well, I'll be there.

RAND:
Val. VaI!

Come here.

I'm not gonna go. I made up
my mind. No, I'm gonna stay.

Yeah?
I'm staying.

I'm staying.

Hi, Dad.
Hi.

What are you doing here?
Sure do get involved in your work.

I've been here for two days already.
So have Azizi and Maleaka.

Oh, it's gotta be the uniform. It must
be the uniform. I'm not that oblivious.

Oh, yes. Yes, I'm afraid you are.
It's been very amusing to watch.

Look. Whose idea is this?

This is a clinic. People die here.

I don't think Gina's ready for this.
David, David, look at her.

She has extraordinary
patience and skill.

She is not a little girl anymore.
Or haven't you noticed that either?

So you think you can handle
having me as a coworker?

Absolutely. Actually, this is
something I've been wanting you to do

for some time. Now, maybe
you can get your boss

to give you a couple of days off
to see Elsa set free.

Oh, Dad, I love Elsa,
but duty calls.

Here you go, let me take these.

Well, I don't know
what your schedule is-

I would love to.

Come on.

Come on. Get down.
Elsa, come.

Right over there.

VAL:
Elsa, come on. Come on.

RAND:
It's not gonna work.

RAND:
Come on. There you go.

Oh, boy.

Elsa.

VAL: Go, girl.
RAND: Come on, Elsa.


They're hurting her.

Are you gonna let
them kill her?!

[GUN SHOOTS]

VAL:
Elsa.

Elsa.

Geri.

It's nothing serious.
It's just a few scratches.

They might have torn her to pieces.

I can't believe those runts
were attacking a lion.

She smells of civilization.
They knew she was an easy mark.

No. She wasn't easy.
She put up a good fight untie...

Yeah, but it didn't work,
and it's not going to work.

We go back to Shama tomorrow.

You promised three weeks.

What's the point
of wasting more time?

The point is you promised.
Three weeks is what we agreed on.

We still have 10 days left.
A lot can happen in 10 days.

A deal is a deal.

All right.

I shouldn't have shot the gun.
I wanted to.

Yeah, but you didn't.
George is right.

In a zoo, she'd be safe.

That's the easiest way out
for everybody.

I don't think it's the best for Elsa.

Elsa.

Elsa.

No, Elsa. Elsa!

This is unbearable.
She has to hunt for her own food.

In the meantime,
she's gonna starve to death.

If we feed her,
we're sending her to a zoo.

You remind me of Elsa, Rand.

I miss her.

It's been three days.

Isn't that what we wanted?

Something may have happened.

She was weak from not having eaten.

What if something attacked her?

Or she's just starving.
Okay, let's go look.

There! Just to the left.

It's her.
Let me see, let me see.

Oh, yeah, that's her.

ALL:
Yes!

Oh, man.

We need some symphony music.


Complications.

Uh-oh.

Come on. Come on.

I think she's found
a new home.

She's not the only one.

Let's go.
