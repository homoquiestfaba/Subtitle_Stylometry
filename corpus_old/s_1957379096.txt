CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
HALLMARK HOME ENTERTAINMENT

AHH!

THIS IS GOING
TO BE SO MUCH FUN,

SEEING SERENA AGAIN.

I WONDER IF SHE'S
AS EXCITED AS I AM.

IT'S HER HUSBAND'S
FUNERAL, MAGGIE.

OH, IRA, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

YOU BETTER HURRY UP.

WE GOT A LONG DRIVE.

MAX DIES ON WEDNESDAY.

SHE WAITS
TILL THE LAST THING
FRIDAY NIGHT TO CALL.

NO TIME TO CHECK ROUTES,
NOTIFY CUSTOMERS.

MONDAY'S THE DAY I
SHOULD CLOSE THE SHOP.

WELL, I'M SURE MAX WOULD
HAVE HELD ON LONGER

IF HE'D JUST KNOWN.

I HOPE SERENA
DOESN'T EXPECT ME

TO BE A PALL BEARER.

SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

SHE JUST SAID
SHE NEEDED OUR HELP.

WELL, I THINK SHE MEANT,
YOU KNOW, MORAL SUPPORT.

MAYBE PALL BEARING
IS MORAL SUPPORT.

WOULDN'T THAT BE
PHYSICAL SUPPORT?

MMM. MAYBE.

OH.

ONE SLICE MEDIUM BROWN,
NO BUTTER.

OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

OH.

AHH!

DAISY, YOU
ARE SO ORGANIZED.

I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

SELF PRESERVATION.

I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ALL PACKED.

I'VE BEEN ALL PACKED
FOR A WEEK.

YOU DIDN'T PACK
YOUR TEDDY BEAR.

MOM, I'M
GOING TO COLLEGE,

NOT SOME
SLUMBER PARTY.

I'LL BET YOU WOULDN'T
BE THE ONLY ONE.

MOTHER, PLEASE.

IT JUST SEEMS SO SAD,
YOU KNOW?

I MEAN, DAVE STOOD
BY YOU ALL THESE YEARS

THROUGH THICK AND THIN.

DAISY.

HONEY...

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS DRESS?

IT'S O.K.

SWEETIE, I AM SO SORRY

THAT WE'RE
GOING TO GO OFF

AND LEAVE YOU
BY YOURSELF

ON YOUR
LAST FULL DAY HOME.

THAT WAS WHEN I WAS 13.

AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE YOU
ALL BY OURSELVES TOMORROW

ON THE DRIVE TO COLLEGE.

MMM.

[CLOCK CHIMES]

MMM! OH,
LOOK AT THE TIME.


DAISY...

WOULD YOU CALL JESSE
AND SAY GOOD-BYE?

WHY CAN'T HE COME OUT
OF HIS WAY FOR A CHANGE

AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME?

OH, WELL,
YOU KNOW JESSE.

BARELY.

WHOO! WHOO
WHOO WHOO!

OH, HI, JESSE.

MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE
ALL GUSSIED UP?

YOU RUNNING AWAY
FROM HOME?

I'M LATE. I'M
GOING TO A FUNERAL,

MAX GILL'S,
SERENA GILL'S HUSBAND.

YOU KNOW THEM.

I DO?

YEAH, YEAH.
DEERLICK, PENNSYLVANIA.

YOU'RE WALKING ALL
THE WAY TO DEERLICK,
PENNSYLVANIA?

NO. I'M GOING
TO THE BODY SHOP
FOR THE CAR.

I'D DRIVE YOU,

BUT THESE PIPES WOULD
KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

CAN I BORROW THAT
TV FROM MY OLD ROOM?

OH, WELL,
IT--IT'S BROKEN.

OH, MAN. JUST MY LUCK.

THAT'S THE WAY
YOU RETURNED IT.

I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

YEAH. OH, OH, JESSE.

IF WE DO HAVE TIME,
WE MIGHT GO BY CARTWHEEL

AND SEE FIONA
AND LEROY.

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WANT ME TO TELL THEM?

THE TEMPERATURE TODAY
IN BALTIMORE

IS A WARM 89.

HUMIDITY HOLDING
RIGHT UP THERE AT 94%.

THE ORIOLES
ARE AT HOME TODAY

FOR
A DOUBLE-HEADER WITH
THE CALIFORNIA ANGELS.

REMEMBER IT'S CAP DAY.

ALL FANS UNDER 12
GET A FREE ORIOLES
CAP.

BE SURE
TO BRING YOUR KIDS.

NOW BACK TO...

MORNING, DAD.

DARN EARLY FOR YOU
TO BE PLOWING AROUND
DOWN THERE.

I ALMOST CALLED THE COPS.

WELL, I'M CLOSING UP
SHOP TODAY.

I WAS PUTTING A SIGN
IN THE WINDOW.

HER HIGHNESS
FIND SOMETHING BETTER
FOR YOU TO DO

THAN EARNING A LIVING?

WE'RE GOING
TO A FUNERAL.

A FUNERAL
DON'T TAKE ALL DAY.

I DON'T EXPECT YOU

TO CLOSE UP SHOP
THE WHOLE DAY
WHEN I GO.

YEAH. WE HAVE
TO DRIVE TO DEERLICK,
PENNSYLVANIA.

MORANS HAVE GOT NO KIN
IN DEERLICK, PENNSYLVANIA.

I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

MAX GILL, UH,

HUSBAND OF
MAGGIE'S BEST FRIEND.

AHH, FIGURES.

SO YOU PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF HIM,

BUT YOU GOT TO CLOSE UP
SHOP ON SATURDAY

AND GO THERE,

AND YOU PROBABLY NEVER
HEARD OF HIM.

WE SANG AT
THEIR WEDDING, DAD.

DON'T LET ME KEEP YOU.

DON'T KEEP
THE PRINCESS WAITING.

JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO
TRAIPSE UP AND DOWN STAIRS

IF THE PHONE RINGS.

JUST LET IT RING, AND
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

YOU START CLOSING UP
SHOP ON SATURDAYS,

YOU'LL BE PUTTING
A "FOR SALE" SIGN
IN THE WINDOW,

AND THEN WHERE
WILL YOU BE?

HELLO.

GOOD MORNING,
MRS. MORAN.

UHH!

THANK YOU.

HEH HEH HEH. OOH!

SORRY. I HAD
TO SLIDE IT BACK.

THAT'S O.K. I LIKE IT
ON THE SECOND NOTCH.

PERFECT MATCH.

FOUND THE ORIGINAL
COLOR TRIM.

WHAT'S THAT?

THE PAINT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

OH, IT'S LOVELY.

IT SMELLS JUST LIKE
FRESH NAIL POLISH.

THIS IS MEL SPRUCE.
WELCOME BACK.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
LOVE AND MARRIAGE.

SO YOU'VE OUTGROWN
THE LOVE THING,
IS THAT RIGHT?

NO. I SAID
THE FIRST TIME
I GOT MARRIED,

IT WAS FOR LOVE...

FIONA?

THIS TIME,
I'M GOING FOR SECURITY.

I'VE GOT A 7-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER TO SUPPORT.

FIONA.

LOOK OUT!

MRS. MORAN,
ARE YOU O.K.?

CERTAINLY.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

AREN'T YOU
GOING TO ASK ME
ABOUT THE FENDER?

OH, YOU
NOTICED THAT, TOO.

THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
IRA MORAN.

OH, LOOK,
WAIT A MINUTE.

IT'S YOUR DENT,
BUT IT'S MY FAULT,
RIGHT?

I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

OH, THAT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY EXPECTS OF ME.

MAGGIE ALWAYS
DOES THINGS SO DUMB.

NO. I WAS JUST
LOOKING FORWARD

TO THAT
MAGICAL FIVE MINUTES,

THAT FRESH
OUT-OF-THE-PAINT-SHOP
SPARKLE

WHEN THE OLD GIRL
LOOKS LIKE NEW AGAIN.

IRA, I'M SO SORRY.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

I WAS JUST DRIVING
OUT OF THE SHOP.

SUDDENLY, FIONA
CAME ON THE RADIO

SAYING SHE WAS
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

MY FOOT HIT THE GAS
INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE.

HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

FIONA CAME ON THE RADIO.
I WAS STARTLED.

THE BRAKE
ISN'T SOMETHING

YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.

YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING

SINCE YOU WERE
16 YEARS OLD, MAGGIE!

HOW CAN YOU MIX THE GAS
WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL?

I WAS STARTLED,
AND I JUST DID.

DROP IT.

THE BRAKE
IS A REFLEX.

I'LL PAY FOR IT
OUT OF MY SALARY.

WELL, THAT WILL TAKE
A LITTLE WHILE...

WITH WHAT THEY PAY
AT THE NURSING HOME.

I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD HAVE STOPPED,

BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE YOU STANDING HERE

WONDERING
WHAT BECAME OF ME.

YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN A HIT-AND-RUN
ACCIDENT?

WELL, HE HIT ME,
AND I RAN.

WHAT DOES THAT MAKE IT?

OH, WELL,
NO NEED TO WORRY.

THE BODY SHOP HAS
OUR NAME AND ADDRESS.

THE COPS WILL
BE AT THE HOUSE

WHEN WE GET BACK
FROM THE FUNERAL.

YOU CAN INVITE THEM
ALL IN FOR SUPPER.

YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT
THEIR WIVES AND KIDS
BY DARK.

WELL, I DON'T
SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH BEING FRIENDLY.

I DON'T SEE HOW YOU
FORGOT TO BRING THE MAP.

I DIDN'T FORGET
TO BRING IT.

I REMEMBERED
NOT TO BRING IT.

WHEN WE GET LOST,
REMEMBER THAT.

WELL, WE WON'T GET LOST.

SERENA SAID YOU TAKE
HIGHWAY 10 TURNOFF,

AND THAT TAKES YOU
PRACTICALLY THERE.

I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A TURNOFF FARTHER NORTH.

NO. JUST
TAKE HIGHWAY 10.

DARN, I MEANT
TO CALL MRS. STOLTZ
FROM THE SHOP.

SHE WAS BRINGING IN
ALL HER LATEST
WATERCOLORS TODAY.

THAT'S O.K.
WE'LL CALL JESSE.

HE'LL GO BY THE SHOP,
LOOK UP HER NUMBER,

AND GIVE HER A CALL.

JESSE TOOK THE BELL
OFF HIS TELEPHONE.

THE WHOLE
CIVILIZED WORLD

MOVING
TOWARD TELEPHONES
WITH PICTURES,

AND YOUR SON DOESN'T
HAVE ONE WITH A BELL.

THE THING
I LOVE ABOUT JESSE

IS HE IS SO CAREFREE.

CAREFREE.

ONE OF THE WORLD'S
GREAT ROCK MUSICIANS

SELLING MOTORCYCLES
FOR A LIVING,

THIS WEEK, AT LEAST.

THAT IS JUST
A SOMETIME THING.

LOOK, EVERYTHING WITH
JESSE IS SOMETIMES--

JOBS, MARRIAGE,
FATHERHOOD.

YOU KNOW, IRA,
I WAS THINKING.

WE COULD STOP BY CARTWHEEL
AFTER THE FUNERAL TODAY

AND JUST SAY HELLO TO--
TO FIONA AND LEROY.

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HEARD ON THE RADIO

FIONA WAS
GETTING MARRIED.

GETTING, NOT GOT.

THERE'S STILL TIME.

NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

LOOK, WHAT
IN THE SAM HILL

WAS FIONA DOING
ON THE RADIO

ANNOUNCING
SHE WAS GETTING MARRIED?

SHE WAS ON A.M. BALTIMORE,

YOU KNOW,
THE MEL SPRUCE SHOW?

PEOPLE WERE CALLING IN
TALKING ABOUT WHAT
MAKES A GOOD MARRIAGE.

FIONA STUCKEY MORAN
SURE QUALIFIES
AS AN EXPERT.

WELL, I KNOW...

BUT WE SHOULD STILL
KEEP AN EYE ON LEROY.

YOU NAME A GIRL
"LEROY,"

SHE BETTER DEVELOP
A SENSE OF TAKING
CARE OF HERSELF.

JUST DROP BY
FOR A LITTLE VISIT.

ANN LANDERS
SAYS DROP-IN VISITS
ARE INCONSIDERATE.

IF YOU'D
MARRIED ANN LANDERS,

YOU COULD
HAVE LIVED A LIFE
OF UTTER CORRECTNESS.

"NELL'S CAFE, 1 MILE."

THEY'LL
HAVE A MAP THERE.

I'M STARVED.

YOU CAN GET
SOMETHING TO EAT

WHILE I
LOOK AT THE MAP.

I DON'T WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT.

YOU SAID
YOU WERE STARVING.

I'M ON A DIET.
I JUST WANT A SNACK.

I HATE HOW YOU TRY
TO UNDERMINE MY DIETS.

YOU DON'T NEED TO DIET.

LOOK JUST RIGHT TO ME.

YOU MEAN,
JUST RIGHT CONSIDERING.

UH-OH. HMM.

DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF SALADS?

OH, WE DON'T SERVE
NO SALADS, HON.

ALL'S I CAN OFFER YOU

IS THE LETTUCE AND
TOMATO OFF THE BLTs.

NO. THIS IS FINE.
COFFEE'S FINE.

MMM. YOU KNOW I MIGHT
JUST HAVE A PACKAGE

OF THE TACO CHIPS
ON THE RACK OVER THERE.

OF COURSE
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.

MAGGIE...

THAT'S SHORT FOR
MARGARET, RIGHT?

YES.

JUST PLAIN OLD MABEL.

WHAT YOU SEE
IS WHAT YOU GET.

IT WAS
MY THIRD GRADE TEACHER

STARTED
CALLING ME MAGGIE

'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T CARE
TOO MUCH FOR THE IRISH.

THEN WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
THAT I LIKED IT,

IT REALLY TORE HER UP.

YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED TO LOSE A POUND,

HONEST, MAGGIE.

OH, THAT'S WHAT IRA SAYS.

HE LIKES ME
THE WAY I AM NOW.

MY DOCTOR MADE
ME LOSE 20 POUNDS,

ELSE HE SAID MY FEET
AND MY ANKLES
WOULDN'T HOLD UP.

I WEAR THE BEST
NURSE'S SHOES
I CAN GET,

BUT COME
QUITTING TIME,

I AM NUMB
FROM THE KNEES DOWN.

THAT IS THE HARDEST
WORK THERE IS.

YEAH.

OUR DAUGHTER DAISY
DOES WAITRESSING.

COURSE IT WAS
JUST SUMMER WORK.

SHE'S GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE TOMORROW.

COLLEGE?

A SMARTY, HUH?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW,

BUT SHE DID
GET A FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

WANT SOME OF THESE?

OH, THANK YOU.

ALL'S I HAD IS BOYS.

THEY WAS DUMB AS SHRUBS.

OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T
GIVE FOR A DAUGHTER.

DAUGHTERS CAN HAVE
THEIR DRAWBACKS, TOO.

MINE HAS JUST CHANGED
OUT OF ALL RECOGNITION.

IRA SAYS IT'S JUST
BECAUSE SHE'S GROWING UP,

BUT SEEMS LIKE THAT NOW

EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT WE DO IS WRONG.

YOU KNOW WHAT SHE
SAID THE OTHER DAY?

I WAS TESTING OUT THIS--
THIS TUNA CASSEROLE,

SO I SERVED IT
FOR SUPPER,

AND I SAID TO HER,
"ISN'T THIS DELICIOUS?

NOW, TELL ME HONESTLY
WHAT YOU THINK."

YEAH?

SO DAISY SAID,

"MOM, WAS THERE
A CERTAIN CONSCIOUS POINT
IN YOUR LIFE

WHEN YOU DECIDED TO SETTLE
FOR BEING ORDINARY?"

OH!

FOR GOD'S SAKES,
MAGGIE.

WELL, I'M SORRY.
IT JUST GOT TO ME

BECAUSE TO ME
I AM NOT ORDINARY.

YOU AREN'T.
YOU TELL HER, HONEY.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I SAID TO BOBBY,
OUR OLDEST?

IT WAS OVER A TUNA DISH,
COME TO THINK OF IT.

AIN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE?

WELL, HE ANNOUNCES,
"I AM SICK TO DEATH
OF FOODS

THAT'S MINGLED TOGETHER."

I SAID, "YOU
JUST LEAVE THIS TABLE.

YOU JUST
LEAVE THIS HOUSE."

HE THOUGHT I
WAS RUNNING MY MOUTH.

HE KNEW I WAS SERIOUS

WHEN I PUT HIS CLOTHES
ON HIS CAR'S HOOD.

MMM.

[DOORBELL JINGLES]

I DON'T KNOW.

THINGS JUST--JUST...

CLOSED IN ON ME TODAY.

WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO A FUNERAL.

SOMEBODY YOU THOUGHT
WOULD LIVE FOREVER.

OH, MAGGIE.

WELL, YOU ARE HOLDING UP
VERY WELL, I'D SAY.

THEN I HEARD THAT
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

IS GOING
TO GET REMARRIED.

WELL, HOW
CAN SHE DO THAT?

AHH, IS IT YOUR SON
THAT PASSED ON?

OH, NO, NO, NO.

MY EX-DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,
I SHOULD HAVE SAID.

YOU SEE,
JESSE NEVER, NEVER

WOULD HAVE DROPPED
OUT OF SCHOOL

IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR DUMB BERNAM

WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD
THIS GREAT SINGING TALENT.

OF COURSE
HE JUMPED ON IT

'CAUSE HIS FATHER'S
ALWAYS AFTER HIM
ABOUT HIS SHORTCOMINGS.

[CLINK CLINK]

WELL, YOU
CAN'T BLAME HIM.

HE HAD THIS LONG
FOLLOWING OF GIRLS,
YOU KNOW,

AND THEN FINALLY HE
HAD THIS ONE SPECIAL GIRL.

WE ALL KNOW
WHO THAT WAS, HUH?

AND YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

ANYWAY,
SO HE BROUGHT HER OVER
TO OUR HOUSE TO LIVE

BECAUSE HE WASN'T
MAKING MUCH MONEY
WORKING PART-TIME,

AND THEN I
WAS JUST THRILLED

WHEN THEY HAD
THIS DARLING BABY,

AND THEN FIONA--
HIS WIFE--AND THE BABY

LEFT AFTER
THIS AWFUL SCENE.

SHE JUST--
JUST UP AND LEFT,

AND--AND--AND I SAID,
"IRA, GO AFTER HER.

IT'S YOUR FAULT
SHE WENT."

WELL, HE SAID,
"JUST LET THEM GO.

LET THEM
GO ON AND GO."

ACCORDING TO THIS MAP,

IT'S ABOUT SIX OF ONE,
HALF A DOZEN OF ANOTHER.

OH, IRA,
JUST TAKE HIGHWAY 10

AND SHUT UP
ABOUT IT!

SIX AND A HALF YEARS,
SEVEN NOW,

AND YOU KEEP DRAGGING UP
THAT FIONA BUSINESS,

BLAMING ME
BECAUSE SHE WALKED OUT.

I WAS JUST
STATING THE FACTS.

OH, NOBODY ASKED
FOR THE FACTS.

I KNEW IT WAS COMING

THE MINUTE YOU STARTED
CALLING EACH OTHER

BY YOUR FIRST NAMES.

ALL-KNOWING IRA MORAN.

IF ANYONE GETS CAUGHT
STANDING STILL,

THEY GET A FULL DOSE
OF OUR FAMILY HISTORY.

IF I AM SUCH
AN EMBARRASSMENT,
LET ME OUT.

GLADLY.

I MEAN IT.

I CANNOT BEAR YOUR COMPANY
ONE MORE SECOND.


ARE YOU GOING TO STOP,

OR DO I HAVE TO JUMP
FROM A MOVING VEHICLE?

OH, UH, MAG...

STOP THAT!

[TIRES SQUEAL]

HI, BABE.
WANT A RIDE?

WHY NOT RUN OVER ME
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

COME ON, LITTLE GIRL.

I'LL BUY YOU A PACKAGE
OF FIG NEWTONS.

YOU CAN SAVE
YOUR FIG NEWTONS

FOR YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

BEG YOUR PARDON?

THERE IS
NO EARTHLY REASON

WHY WE SHOULDN'T STOP
AFTER THE FUNERAL

AND SAY HELLO TO YOUR
OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,
LITTLE LEROY.

GET RID OF ALL
THOSE ILL FEELINGS.

IT'D DO YOU
A WORLD OF GOOD.

MAGGIE--AND DON'T
START JUMPING OUT
OF THE CAR AGAIN--

JUST LISTEN.

I THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

TODAY HAS
GOT ENOUGH BAD GOING
FOR IT ALREADY.

BOTH TIMES WE'VE
TRIED VISITING FIONA,

IT TURNED SOUR,
REMEMBER?

YOU KEEP LOOKING
FOR SOME KIND
OF HAPPY ENDING

TO THIS JESSE
AND FIONA BUSINESS.

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
FIND IT IN CARTWHEEL,

NO, MA'AM.

MMM. SOUNDS LIKE
A MAYBE TO ME.

THIS IS DEERLICK,
ISN'T IT?

YEAH. BOTH SIDES
OF THE STREET.

SERENA DID SAY SATURDAY,
DIDN'T SHE?

I DIDN'T KNOW
MAX OWNED A TIE.

HELLO.

HELLO.

I WONDER
IF THEY'VE GOT SIDES,

LIKE AT A WEDDING--

BRIDE'S SIDE,
GROOM'S SIDE.

WEDDING'S HAVE SIDES.

FUNERALS JUST HAVE
FRONT AND BACK.


DID YOU FIND
SOME GRAFFITI?

LISTEN TO THIS.

"IN MEMORY
OF VIVIAN DEWAR,

BELOVED HUSBAND
AND FATHER."

CAN YOU IMAGINE
HAVING A HUSBAND
NAMED VIVIAN?

YOU SHOULD TALK--

FOR SOMEONE WITH
A GRANDDAUGHTER
NAMED LEROY.

IT'S LEROY.

IRA.

FEAR NOT.

ANYONE COMES IN,

I CAN MAKE THESE DISAPPEAR
AS IF BY MAGIC.

YOU'RE AN ADDICT.

TSK.

PUT THE JACK
ON HERE.

BUTT OUT, MAGGIE.

MAGGIE!

SERENA?

MAGGIE, YOU CAME.

OH, SERENA,

I'M SO, SO SORRY.

OH.

I KNOW, BUT I'M
SO, SO EXCITED
TO SEE YOU.

LET'S NOT HAVE
ANY "SORRYS".

IRA.

[KISS KISS]

HOW ARE YOU?

FINE, FINE.

A LITTLE HITCH
HERE AND THERE.

SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT MAX.

I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL
YOU MADE THE DRIVE.

THANK YOU.

OH, SERENA,
YOU JUST LOOK...

WONDERFUL.

I MEAN,
CONSIDERING.

OH, MAGGIE.

BEFORE THE OTHERS
COME...

OH, I JUST MISS OUR
GIRL-TO-GIRL TALKS
SO MUCH.

WE CAME DOWN
HIGHWAY 10
LIKE YOU SAID.

DID I SAY HIGHWAY 10?

I LOVE THAT LIPSTICK
YOU'RE WEARING.

YOU ASKED ME
ON MY WEDDING DAY

HOW I KNEW MAX
WAS THE RIGHT ONE.

YOU SAID YOU KNEW
MAX WAS THE RIGHT ONE

BECAUSE YOU WERE RIGHT
AT THE END OF THE LINE.

YOU WERE NOWHERES NEAR
THE END OF THE LINE.

OH, YEAH, I WAS.

AND YOU ASKED ME
HOW I COULD RESIST IRA,

BECAUSE HE WAS
SO MYSTERIOUS.

HA! MYSTERIOUS?

YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO RESIST HIM,

BECAUSE HE WASN'T
CHASING YOU.

OH, MAGGO, IT SEEMS
LIKE YESTERDAY.

IT'S ALL
COME AND GONE.

I WAS THINKING
LAST NIGHT

THAT LIFE'S BEEN
LIKE A LONG WEEKEND.

WHEN IT'S COMING UP,

YOU THINK
IT'LL GO ON FOREVER.

AND THEN IT'S GONE,

AND YOU'VE
DONE NOTHING.

I WAS TRYING
TO REMEMBER

WHEN WE WERE
JUST GIRLS.

OH, OUR LURID PAST.

I WISH
IT HAD BEEN LURIDER.

I WANTED TO BE
THE KIND OF GIRL

MOTHERS WERE AFRAID
TO HAVE THEIR SONS
AROUND AFTER DARK.

YOU DIDN'T SO BAD.

IT'S A GOOD THING MAX
DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION
TO HIS MOTHER.

I WAS HORRIBLE TO HIM
AT THE LAST.

OH, NO.

YOU DON'T KNOW.

ONE DAY HE WAS OUT
SELLING RADIO ADS.

THE NEXT DAY
HE TURNED YELLOW,

AND HIS UPPER LIP
DISAPPEARED.

THE NEXT THING
I KNEW--

FLAT ON HIS BACK
IN BED.

THE CANCER JUST
SWEPT OVER HIM.

THAT'S AWFUL.

I NAGGED HIM
TO TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF,

BUT, NO.

TO HEAR HIM TELL IT,

JOGGERS WERE
DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

HE WOULD NEVER
EAT ANYTHING

THAT WAS
THE LEAST BIT GREEN,

LIKE LETTUCE
OR BROCCOLI.

I WAS HORRIBLE
TO HIM AT THE END.

WELL, HE SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN--

I'M SURE HE DID--

THAT YOU WERE
BESIDE YOURSELF.

WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO GLOSS
THINGS OVER?

I WAS HORRIBLE
TO HIM.

HE WAS GOING.

HE WAS LEAVING ME
WITH ALL HIS
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

THAT I DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND,

LIKE SOME DUMB
IRS AUDIT FOR $87.

IT'S BEEN HANGING ON
FOR THREE YEARS.

INSURANCE POLICIES
I CAN'T FIND.

HE LET HIS
CAR LICENSE EXPIRE.

OH, I WAS
SO ANGRY AT HIM,

I JUST
RANTED AT HIM,

AND HE JUST...DIED.

I DIDN'T NOTICE
A CASKET OR ANYTHING.

WHERE IS MAX?

AT HOME IN THE CLOSET.

I'M FLINGING HIS ASHES
ON THE CHESAPEAKE
NEXT SUMMER.

THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

I THINK
THAT'S JUST FINE.

NO. I WAS THINKING
LAST NIGHT,

WHY AM I HAVING
THIS FUNERAL ANYWAY?

IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE BURYING HIM.

WHY SHOULD WE SIT
IN THAT CHURCH

LISTENING
TO OLD MRS. PHILBERT

TINKLING OUT
GOSPEL HYMNS
ON THE PIANO,

STUMBLING UP THE PATH
OF RIGHTEOUSNESS?

AND I THOUGHT,

WHY NOT CISSY PARTON
PLAYING MY PRAYER

LIKE AT OUR WEDDING.

I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

WHY NOT ALL OF IT?

JOANNE McDERMOTT
READING FROM
THE PROPHET.

DURWOOD KLEIG
COULD SING

I WANT YOU,
I NEED YOU,
I LOVE YOU.

I DON'T THINK
THEY'D UNDERSTAND

UNLESS THEY'D BEEN
AT THE WEDDING.

JUST LET THEM WONDER.

THE MINISTER DOESN'T
WANT TO TAKE PART,

BUT THE DEACON
WILL PRESIDE.

NOTHING SACRILEGIOUS,
OF COURSE.

I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE LESS STUFFY,

AND, MAGGO,
I WANT YOU AND IRA

TO SING LOVE IS A MANY
SPLENDORED THING

JUST LIKE YOU DID
AT THE WEDDING.

I--I DON'T KNOW, SERENA.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IRA
WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT.

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HUMOR HER.

UNDER NO CONCEIVABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES.

NOR WILL I TAP-DANCE
OR PLAY THE SPOON.

IF SHE WERE
YOUR ABSOLUTE
BEST FRIEND, I--

BEST FRIEND.

OH.

HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THE LYRICS?

"I'M BY YOUR SIDE
AND SATISFIED."

AT A FUNERAL?

MEMORIAL SERVICE.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

THERE IS NO COFFIN
PRESENT.

IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M BY HIS SIDE
IN A COFFIN.

I'M BY HIS SIDE
IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE

IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

WELL, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
FOR A CEREMONY.

OH, THE BARLOW TWINS.

[KISS KISS KISS]

HOW SWEET OF YOU
TO COME.

WELL, HELLO,
STRANGER.

DURWOOD.

SERENA TOLD ME
YOU WERE GOING
TO BE HERE.

YOU REMEMBER IRA.

DURWOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

YOU'RE LOOKING
GREAT, MAGGIE.

EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

SORRY.

DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
I CAN WRITE ON?

SERENA'S ASKED ME
TO SING.

OH, RIGHT.

LET'S SEE.

THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING IN HERE.

COULD YOU HOLD THOSE?

OH, HERE. YES.

IT'S A SHAMPOO COUPON,

BUT YOU CAN
WRITE ON THE BACK.

I WANT IT BACK.

COULD I HAVE YOUR PURSE
TO WRITE ON?

OH, SURE.

HERE.

THERE.

THANKS.

NOW, LET'S SEE.

I WANT YOU...

I NEED YOU...

I LOVE YOU.

WHAT'S THE REST?

GOOD GRIEF.

[PLAYING
MY PRAYER]

IRA, IF YOU WON'T
SING WITH ME,

I'LL HAVE TO SING
BY MYSELF.

I'M NOT GOING
TO DO IT.

YOU GUYS, HELP ME.

I JUST CAN'T SING,
"I'M BY YOUR SIDE
AND SATISFIED."

THERE'S NOT A CASKET
UP THERE OR ANYTHING.

HOW ABOUT
THE GREAT PRETENDER?

DAVY CROCKETT.

THE YELLOW ROSE
OF TEXAS.

YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

THINK OF
A DORIS DAY SONG.

THEY'RE ALWAYS SAFE.

AS DEACON
OF THIS CHURCH,

I CAN ASSURE YOU

THAT THE MEMBERS
OF OUR CONGREGATION

WILL HAVE A WARM PLACE
IN THEIR HEARTS
FOR MAX GILL

AND HIS TIRELESS EFFORTS

AS CHAIRMAN
OF THE FURNACE FUND.

â™ª WHEN I WAS JUST
A LITTLE GIRL â™ª

â™ª I ASKED MY MOTHER
WHAT WILL I BE â™ª

â™ª WILL I BE PRETTY? â™ª

â™ª WILL I BE RICH? â™ª

â™ª HERE'S WHAT
SHE SAID TO ME â™ªâ™ª

â™ª I WANT YOU â™ª

â™ª I NEED YOU â™ª

â™ª I LOVE YOU â™ª

[PLAYING LOVE IS
A MANY SPLENDORED THING]

FOR MAX.

â™ª LOVE IS A MANY
SPLENDORED THING â™ª

â™ª IT'S THE APRIL ROSE
THAT ONLY GROWS â™ª

â™ª IN THE EARLY SPRING â™ª

â™ª LOVE IS NATURE'S WAY
OF GIVING â™ª

â™ª A REASON
TO BE LIVING â™ª

â™ª THE GOLDEN CROWN
THAT MAKES A MAN A KING â™ª

â™ª ONCE ON A HIGH
AND WINDY HILL â™ª

â™ª IN THE MORNING MIST â™ª

â™ª TWO LOVERS KISSED â™ª

â™ª AND THE EARTH
STOOD STILL â™ª

â™ª THEN YOUR FINGERS TOUCHED
MY SHINING HEART â™ª

â™ª AND TAUGHT IT HOW
TO SING â™ª

â™ª YES, TRUE LOVE'S â™ª

â™ª A MANY SPLENDORED THING â™ªâ™ª

I WAS VERY MOVED
WHEN YOU SANG.

OH, IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

I WANTED TO SING
YOU'LL NEVER
WALK ALONE.

MAGGIE, I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME

GET THINGS READY
AT HOME.

IRA, THANKS. YOU SANG
A LITTLE SOFTLY.

WELL, I--
I WARMED TO IT.

SERENA,
I'VE BEEN WONDERING.

ARE YOU MOVING
TO NEW JERSEY?

WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

TO BE NEAR
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN.

OH. WELL, I NEVER FELT

I HAD THAT MUCH TO DO
WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN.

HOW IS
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?

LARUE, ISN'T IT?

LEROY. I'M REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT HER

NOW THAT FIONA'S
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO LET GO.

I DON'T WANT
TO LET GO.

YOU KNOW, NOW
ALL OF A SUDDEN

EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

JESSE DOESN'T LIVE
AT HOME ANYMORE.

DAISY'S GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE.

NOW THEY'RE EVEN THINKING
ABOUT LAYING OFF PEOPLE

FROM THE NURSING HOME.

THAT'S WHAT IT ALL COMES
DOWN TO IN THE END,
ISN'T IT--

PRUNING AND DISPOSING.

A GOOD DAY
IN YOUR LIFE

IS WHEN YOU CAN LOOK
AT YOUR CHILDREN
AND SAY,

IF I DIE TOMORROW,
THEY'D BE ALL RIGHT.

THROW OUT THE TOYS.
MOVE TO A SMALLER HOUSE.

HERE I AM, EVERYONE.

THERE'S PLENTY
OF FOOD AND DRINK.

IF YOU WANT TO USE
THE POWDER ROOM,

YOU'D BETTER
TAKE A NUMBER.

MI CASA ES SU CASA.

DURWOOD, I OWE YOU
THE WORLD

FOR COMING TO MY RESCUE.

MAGGIE, I LOVED IT.

WE KILLED THEM.

OOPS. YOUR COUPON.

OH, OH.

IT'S A LITTLE
WORSE FOR WEAR.

THAT'S FINE.

THE DUMP SALAD
IS MINE.

DUMP SALAD?

IT'S SO EASY.

YOU TAKE A PACKAGE
OF ORANGE GELATIN POWDER,

A CAN OF CRUSHED PINEAPPLE,
AND SOME APPLES,

AND A CARTON OF PREPARED
WHIPPED TOPPING,

AND KAZAM--
YOU'VE GOT DUMP SALAD.

WELL, I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

I'VE GOT A TREAT FOR YOU.

BE SURE--

NO, THAT'S--

DID YOU HAVE
ONE OF THESE?

MUST BE A POUND
OF BUTTER IN THEM.

NO GOOD FOR OUR
LITTLE WAISTLINES.

LISTEN, I HEAR THESE
CHOCOLATE CHIPS
ARE GREAT.

SHOWTIME.

OH, OH. EVERYBODY,
PAY ATTENTION.

PEOPLE, PEOPLE.

HERE'S COMES THE SURPRISE
I PROMISED YOU--

THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE.

I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU

THE MOVIES OF MAX'S
AND MY WEDDING.

OH, I DON'T THINK--

COULD YOU HELP ME
WITH THIS?

OH, VERY GOOD.

OH, MY GOODNESS.

IS HE HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THAT SCREEN?

YOU WANT IT TO GO
ALL THE WAY.

[MOVIE PROJECTOR RUNS]

NOW THERE WE ARE.

SERENA'S GOING
TO SHOW MOVIES
OF THEIR WEDDING...

29 YEARS AGO.

I BET YOU DON'T
REMEMBER THAT,
DO YOU?

YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

IT WAS A SATURDAY.

YOU CAME BY
THE FRAME SHOP
TO PICK ME UP.

YOU WERE WEARING
A BLUE DRESS,

AND YOU WERE CARRYING
YOUR LITTLE HAT
IN YOUR HAND

SO YOU WOULDN'T
MESS YOUR HAIR.

DAD TOOK ONE LOOK
AT YOU AND SAID,

"DON'T GET ANY IDEAS,
MISS DALEY,

"DON'T EVER EXPECT
IRA TO GET MARRIED,

"BECAUSE HE CAN'T.

HE'S GOT RESPONSIBILITIES."

AND I SAID, "I'M GOING
TO MARRY MAGGIE DALEY
REGARDLESS,

SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET USED TO IT."

IT HAPPENED SOONER
THAN HE THOUGHT.

THAT ABOUT COVER IT?

YOU ARE THE MOST
EXASPERATING MAN

ON THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

OH, OH.


SERENA.

MAGGIE, I DO NOT
BELIEVE THIS.

SERENA.

YOU ARE ALWAYS
IMPOSSIBLE,

BUT AT
A FUNERAL GATHERING

IN THE BED I SHARED
WITH MY HUSBAND.

WE WERE JUST SITTING
ON THE EDGE.

GO.

JUST GO.


OH, IRA.

IRA, WHAT
DID WE DO?

SHE'S NEVER GOING
TO FORGIVE ME.

OF COURSE SHE WILL,

BUT RIGHT NOW
SHE'LL THANK US

TO TAKE OFF
OUT THE BACK DOOR.

OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

HERE, LET ME.


OH, I AM
SO SORRY.

AREN'T YOU?

NOT ONE THIMBLEFUL.


I'M GLAD WE'RE
LEAVING EARLY.

WE CAN
STOP BY CARTWHEEL

AND SAY HELLO
TO FIONA AND LEROY.

IT'LL BE DARK BEFORE
WE FIND THE TURNOFF.

THE TURNOFF
IS MOOSEGOW--
HOOSEGOW.

DO YOU REMEMBER
FIVE YEARS AGO?

YOU EVEN CALLED,
AND FIONA WAS GONE?

I SAT ON THAT STOOP
FOR THREE HOURS

HOLDING THAT GIGANTIC
RAGGEDY ANN DOLL

LOOKING LIKE
THE VILLAGE IDIOT.

NO, THANKS. UH-UH.

ARE YOU AFRAID
TO SEE THEM?

HA HA HA.

YOU COULD HAVE
HELPED ME SING,
YOU KNOW.

DURWOOD DID.

WHY, YOU TURN
A FLASHLIGHT
ON DURWOOD KLEIG,

HE'LL SING TO YOU.

â™ª LOVE IS A MANY
SPLENDORED THING â™ªâ™ª

SEE? YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN GREAT.

â™ª DA DA DA
DA-DA DA â™ªâ™ª

I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU REMEMBERED

THAT GREAT BIG OLD
RAGGEDY ANN DOLL

YOU BROUGHT LEROY
WAY BACK THEN.

OF COURSE I DID.

YOU KNOW, IRA,

DON'T YOU THINK SOMEBODY

OUGHT TO OFFER
TO BABYSIT FOR FIONA

WHILE SHE GOES
ON HER HONEYMOON?

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH WHAT'S-HER-NAME,

THE OTHER GRANDMOTHER?

MRS. STUCKEY?

THAT WOMAN HAS BEEN FILLING
OUR GRANDDAUGHTER'S LUNGS

FULL OF SECOND-HAND SMOKE
FOR YEARS.

MAYBE SHE QUIT.

IT WOULD BE
WORTH A TRIP
TO FIND OUT.

WOULDN'T IT SET
YOUR MIND AT EASE
TO KNOW THAT?

YOU'RE PLOTTING
TO HAVE THAT CHILD
COME LIVE WITH US.

NOW THAT DAISY'S
GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE,

YOU'RE SCHEMING
TO HAVE LEROY

COME FILL HER PLACE.

ONCE YOU GET HER HOME,

YOU THINK YOU CAN
HOLD HER HOSTAGE

WITH ALL KINDS
OF GRANDMA MAGIC.

NO. MY IDEA WAS
JUST TO DROP BY

AND TO OFFER
TO BABYSIT,

BECAUSE...FIONA
ISN'T MARRIED AGAIN,

AS YET,

AND I OWE IT TO HER
TO CASUALLY...

OWE IT TO HER?

JUST CASUALLY
REMIND HER

OF SOME
OF THE GOOD TIMES,

AND THEN MAYBE--
OH, IRA--

MAYBE SHE JUST MIGHT
RECONSIDER JESSE
A LITTLE BIT.

MAGGIE, YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP DOING THIS.

DOING WHAT?

YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE LIVING

SOME KIND
OF PRACTICE LIFE,

LIKE YOU CAN PLAY
AROUND WITH IT,

GET SECOND, THIRD CHANCES
TO GET IT RIGHT.

JESSE AND FIONA
ARE A LOST CAUSE.

GET IN THE CAR.

YOU JUST NEVER SAW

THE LOVING SIDE
OF JESSE AND FIONA.

YOU HAD TO LOOK FAST.

WELL, IT'S J-JUST THAT

WHEN ONE OF THEM
MAKES A MOVE
TOWARDS RECONCILING,

THE OTHER ONE
ISN'T LISTENING.

IT'S LIKE
SOME KIND OF AWFUL,

OUT-OF-SYNC DANCE

WHERE THE TWO OF THEM
NEVER CAN JUST GET
IN STEP TOGETHER.

OO-OOPS.

WATCH OUT
ABOUT THAT CAR.

WELL, HONK AT HIM.

I'LL JUST PASS HIM UP.

[HONK HONK]

THE RULE IS THE PERSON
STEERING THE CAR

IS THE ONE
WHO HONKS THE HORN.

WHAT DID I DO?

YOU SCARED THAT FELLA
OUT OF WHAT FEW WITS
HE HAD LEFT.

I WISH YOU'D MANAGE
NOT TO STICK YOUR NOSE

IN WHAT DOESN'T
CONCERN YOU.

IF I DIDN'T,
WHO WOULD?

AND HOW CAN YOU SAY
IT DOESN'T CONCERN ME

WHEN HERE I SIT
IN WHAT'S KNOWN
AS THE DEATH SEAT?

BESIDES, IT WASN'T
MY HONKING THE HORN
THAT CAUSED THE TROUBLE.

IT WAS THAT CRAZY DRIVER

WHO STOPPED UP THERE
WITHOUT ANY REASON.

NOW HURRY UP.
CATCH UP TO HIM.

I WANT TO GET
HIS NUMBER.

DRIVERS LIKE THAT OUGHT TO
BE THROWN OFF THE ROAD.

MAGGIE.

IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST AS MUCH
OUR FAULT

AS IT WAS HIS.

I BET HE INTENDED
FOR YOU TO REAR-END HIM.

HE JUST WANTED
TO GET A NEW CAR

OR A WHIPLASH LAWSUIT.

I READ ABOUT THAT
ALL THE TIME.

I'M GOING
TO GET HIS LICENSE.

MM-HMM. I GOT IT.

YOU PULLED YOUR LAST
FAST ONE, MISTER.

MAGGIE.

WELL, PASS HIM.

PASS HIM.

IT'S DANGEROUS
TO FOLLOW BEHIND

A CRAZY MAN LIKE THAT.

WATCH THIS.

YOUR WHEEL.

YOUR FRONT WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF.

WELL, NOW WHY
DID YOU GO AND DO THAT?

WELL, NOW WHAT?

OH, IRA.

HE DIDN'T MEAN TO
RUN US OFF THE ROAD.

HE PROBABLY
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

DID YOU SEE HIM?

HE HAD THIS KIND
OLD FACE,

AND WHEN I YELLED AT HIM
ABOUT THE WHEEL,

HE LOOKED SCARED.

HE TIPPED HIS HAT,

JUST LIKE
MY GRANDFATHER USED TO.

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

HE THINKS
WE'RE PLAYING A TRICK,

THAT WE'RE RACIST,

AND WE LIED TO HIM.

WE HAVE TO
GO TELL HIM.

THAT NICE FACE
WILL HAUNT ME
IF WE DON'T.

JUST THINK.

ALL UP AND DOWN
THIS HIGHWAY,

OTHER COUPLES ARE OUT
FOR A WEEKEND DRIVE,

TRAVELING FROM
POINT "A" TO POINT "B,"

NO DETOURS,

STOPPING AT SOME
NICE INN FOR LUNCH.

OH, I KNEW
YOU COULDN'T
BE HEARTLESS.

YOU NEED SOME HELP?

IT'S MY WHEEL.

LADY UP THE ROAD
A WAYS POINTED OUT

MY WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF.

OH, THAT WAS ME.

I'M MAGGIE MORAN.

THIS IS MY HUSBAND IRA.

YES. MY...

MY NAME IS
MR. DANIEL OTIS,
MA'AM,

AND I CERTAINLY
WANT TO THANK YOU.

I COULD'VE DROVE
TO MY DEATH.

OH, WELL...

I--I THINK
I MIGHT'VE BEEN MISTAKEN.

IT SEEMS SOLID TO ME.

I THINK IT'S O.K.

OH, WELL,
IT SURELY SEEMS FINE

WHEN THE CAR'S
SITTING STOCK STILL
LIKE IT IS.

I MEAN WHEN YOU WERE
BACK ON THE ROAD.

OH, NO.

NO, I COULD
FEEL IT WOBBLE
ALL RIGHT,

ONCE YOU CALLED
MY ATTENTION TO IT.

YOU COULD?

UH, LOOK.

WHY DON'T I JUST GET IN,

DRIVE IT AHEAD
A FEW FEET

AND YOU TWO
KEEP AN EYE ON IT, HUH?

YOU'LL SEE IT'S O.K.

OH, NO. I DON'T
WANT TO PUT YOU
IN MORTAL DANGER.

UH, NO DANGER.

BELIEVE ME.

YOU SEE,

I HAD THIS KIND OF...

LIKE A...

A MIRAGE...

WHEN WE DROVE
PAST YOUR CAR.

[ENGINE STARTS]

AND I THOUGHT THAT
I SAW YOUR WHEEL WOBBLE

A LITTLE BIT.

BUT THEN
IN THE NEXT INSTANT,

I SAID, "NO,

I THINK
I MUST'VE IMAGINED THAT."

DIDN'T I, IRA?

UH-HUH.

JUST ASK IRA.

THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF EXPLANATIONS

WHY YOU MIGHT'VE
SEEN IT WOBBLE.

OH, YEAH.

OH, YES, CERTAINLY.
CERTAINLY.

THE HEAT...

HEAT WAVES RIPPLING UP
FROM THE PAVEMENT.

UH...

OH, I DON'T KNOW.

MIGHT'VE BEEN
A SIGN, TOO.

A SIGN?

MIGHT'VE BEEN THE LORD

TRYING TO WARN ME.

SOUND AS A DOLLAR TO ME.

WELL, THAT'S...

THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD'VE SWORE
DRIVING HER,

BUT, NOW,
THE LADY'S
RIGHT.

I COULD SEE IT
WOBBLE ALL RIGHT
ENOUGH.

I THINK I SAW IT
WOBBLE A LITTLE BIT,
TOO.

EXCUSE ME?

I CAN'T HELP IT, IRA.

I DID SEE IT WOBBLE.

IT LOOKED
KIND OF SQUASHY, TOO.

NOW, LOOK HERE, MAGGIE--

FOLKS, UH...

I DON'T DESERVE
PROPERTIES

LOOKING OVER ME
LIKE THIS.

YOU PEOPLE

ARE A GODSEND.

I MEAN,
ANYBODY ELSE

WOULD LET ME
JUST DRIVE ON
TO MY DEATH.

PROVIDENCE
AND A GOOD LUG WRENCH

IS ALL WE NEED
IN A CASE LIKE THIS.

WE'LL JUST TIGHTEN UP
THOSE LUG NUTS,

AND YOU'D BE
ON YOUR WAY,
SAFE AND SOUND.

OH, SHOOT.

I...

I JUST REMEMBERED.

SOMEBODY STOLE
THAT LUG WRENCH

OUT OF MY TRUNK
A WHILE BACK.

HOW DID
THEY FIND IT?

DID YOU HEAR THAT?

I SURE ADMIRE A LADY

WHO COULD JEST
IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY.

DON'T YOU?

OH, YEAH.

YEAH.

WELL, I'LL JUST, UH...

GET THE LUG WRENCH
OUT OF OUR CAR.

OH, IRA,
I DON'T THINK SO.

WHAT?

YOU REMEMBER WHEN
I HAD THAT FLAT
LAST MONTH,

AND THAT YOUNG FELLA
WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO CHANGE THE--

BUT HE WASN'T
NICE ENOUGH

TO PUT THE JACK
AND THE LUG WRENCH BACK?

I DROVE RIGHT BACK
THE NEXT MORNING,

BUT THEY WERE GONE.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE VALUABLES
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

WHAT IF I WERE
TO TELL YOU THAT, UH...

WE LIED TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR WHEEL
BACK THERE,

THAT WE WERE
JUST MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU...

WERE DRIVING
ERRATICALLY?

OH.

I UNDERSTAND.

YOU'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH

TO COME BACK
AND WARN ME,

BUT, UH, WHY DON'T
Y'ALL JUST GO ON NOW,

AND I'LL HITCH A RIDE
TO BUFORD?

I GOT A NEPHEW WHO WORKS
IN A GAS STATION.

HE CAN COME BACK
AND FIX ME UP.

GO HOME.

I'LL CATCH ME A RIDE.

YOU'LL DO
NO SUCH THING.

WE'LL--WE'LL
GIVE YOU A RIDE.

WHERE IS BUFORD?

THERE'S ONE IN CANADA,
I THINK.

YOU FOLKS
DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.

HE SAID
LeMONT IS DUE BACK
WITH THE WRECKER

ANY TIME NOW.

A FEW MINUTES
WON'T CHANGE OUR LIVES,

WILL IT, IRA?

WE'LL WAIT WITH YOU.

DO THEY HAVE
A SNACK MACHINE
INSIDE?

YOU MEAN CHIPS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?

YEAH.

OH, YEAH.

I THINK I'D LIKE
SOME PRETZELS.

WHAT CAN I GET
YOU TWO?

WHAT, ON MY DIET?

MR. OTIS,
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING?

YOU KNOW,

I--I WAS
THINKING PRETZELS,

EVEN WHEN I WAS DRIVING.

AIN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE,
THOUGH?

UH, PRETZELS IT IS.

HA HA.

WELL...

SO...

HOW ABOUT WE GO
SET A SPELL?

WERE YOU
ON YOUR WAY HOME

WHEN YOU
HAD THE TROUBLE
WITH THE WHEEL?

NO.

WELL, YOU KNOW,
LIKE I SAID.

I'VE BEEN STAYING
WITH MY SISTER LORENE
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

ME AND MY WIFE DELUTH...

HAD A BIG FALLING OUT.

OHH.

OH, THAT'S A SHAME,
MR. OTIS...

DANIEL.

DANIEL.

YOU KNOW...

SHE GOT MAD AT ME

FOR SOMETHING
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE DONE

IN HER DREAM.

OH, WELL,
I KNOW HOW THAT IS.

YOU KNOW,
YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

AND IT SEEMS
SO REAL.

YEAH, WELL, I GUESS.

SHE WAS MAD ENOUGH
TO KILL ME WHEN I WOKE UP.

SH-SHE SAID
SHE CAUGHT ME

WALKING ON HER
NEEDLEPOINT.

NO.

SHE SAID,
"YOU'RE THE MOST
STUBBORN OLD MAN

I EVER KNEW,
DANIEL OTIS."

50 YEARS MARRIED,

AND THAT WAS
THE MADDEST

I HAVE EVER SEEN HER.

50 YEARS.

CONGRATULATIONS.

MMM.

THANK YOU.

LeMONT...

YOU KNOW,
WHO WE'RE WAITING FOR?

HE'S DIVORCED.

MY SISTER FLORENCE'S
GIRL SALLY,

SHE'S DIVORCED.

I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY EVEN BOTHER
GETTING MARRIED ANYMORE.

MY SON JESSE'S DIVORCED.

OHH.

MAKES YOU SO SAD,
DON'T IT?

OH, IRA...

MR. OTIS' WIFE
IS MAD AT HIM

FOR SOMETHING HE DID
IN HER DREAM.

HE WALKED
ON HER NEEDLEPOINT.

YOU DON'T SAY?

WELL, I THINK
I'M GOING TO GO

AND GET US
ALL A DRINK.

THEY HAVE DIET DRINKS
IN THERE?

BIG OLD REACH-IN COOLER
OUT THERE.

OH.

THANK YOU.

THE MISSIS
WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR SON.

SAD,
THE YOUNG ONES
TODAY.

YES, IT IS.

MMM.

MUSICIAN...

HMM HMM HMM.

SHE SAID.

MUSICIAN WHO CAN'T
CARRY A TUNE.

OH, MY.

NOW, THAT IS
TOO BAD.

OH, I GUESS
I'VE HEARD WORSE
THAN JESSE

WHO GOT PAID
A LOT MORE.

ISN'T THAT A FACT?

YOU KNOW, I HATE TO
TURN ON MY RADIO.

OH, THEY JUST
DON'T MAKE THEM

LIKE NAT KING COLE
NOWADAYS.

NO, THEY SURELY DON'T.

YOU KNOW,

I SHOULD STAY AWAY
FROM THIS SALT,

BUT I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF
AN OCCASION,

AIN'T IT?

WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DO, IRA?

I MEAN,
IF I CAN ASK.

I'M A FRAMER.

OH...
HOUSES AND SUCH.

NO.
PICTURES AND SUCH--

PAINTINGS,

DOCUMENTS.

MMM.

EVEN NEEDLEPOINT.

WHAT IN SAM HILL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

WOBBLY WHEEL.

THESE KIND FOLKS
BROUGHT ME HERE FOR HELP.

WE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE PASSING BY.

IT WAS THE MISSIS
WHO CAUGHT ON TO IT.

SHE LEANED OUT HER WINDOW
AND CALLED,

"YOUR WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF."

I'D OFFER YOU
MY HAND,

BUT THIS SODA
JUST FIZZED
ALL OVER IT.

IT WAS HER WHO
FIRST SAW IT WAS LOOSE.

WELL, IT WASN'T
REALLY LOOSE.

I JUST
MADE THAT UP.

SAY WHAT?

I FIBBED.

YOU MEAN
YOU LIED TO HIM?

LeMONT,
I'LL TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

I DO BELIEVE,
NOW THAT I
THINK BACK ON IT,

THAT WHEEL HASN'T
BEEN ACTING RIGHT

FOR SOME DAYS NOW.

DIDN'T I SAY
YOU OUGHT TO
GIVE UP DRIVING?

DIDN'T FLORENCE BEG YOU
TO TURN IN YOUR LICENSE?

SEE, NOW,
IF YOU STAYED HOME
WITH AUNT DELUTH,

NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE HAPPENING.

I--I DON'T WANT
TO BE ANY TROUBLE--

MAN, SEE,
YOU BEEN MARRIED
50-SOME YEARS,

AND HALF THE TIME,

YOU BOTH FUSSING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

ONE OF YOU
ALWAYS MOVING OUT.

SHOOT, MAN,
THE LAST TIME
YOU BOTH MOVED OUT

AND LEFT THAT
PERFECTLY GOOD HOUSE
STANDING EMPTY.

WELL, AT LEAST
I'M STILL MARRIED,

UNLIKE CERTAIN OTHERS
I COULD NAME.

DRIVING ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY

LIKE SOME OLD HIPPIE
IN THAT OLD CAR.

IF THERE'S ANY EXPENSE--

NO, THERE AIN'T
GOING TO BE
NO EXPENSE.

NOW, LeMONT
IS FAMILY.

AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
LeMONT?

YES, SIR.

COME ON
AND GET IN THE TRUCK.

AS IF I AIN'T GOT
NOTHING ELSE BETTER TO DO
WITH MY TIME.

BOY SURE IS
CRANKY.

I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE TAKE AFTER.

BUT DON'T Y'ALL
PAY HIM NO NEVERMIND.

HE JUST WANTS TO
RANT AND CARRY ON.

I WANT TO THANK
BOTH OF YOU.

WELL...

AND I HOPE
THINGS WORK OUT
WITH DELUTH.

OH, THEY ALWAYS DO...

SOONER OR LATER.

BYE-BYE.

BYE-BYE, NOW.


WELL...

SO ANYHOW...

MAGGIE.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY IT.

SPRUCE GUM.

WHAT?

SPRUCE GUM.

THAT'S THE TURNOFF
TO CARTWHEEL...

ACCORDING TO
DANIEL THERE.

THAT IS, IF YOU
STILL WANT TO SEE
FIONA AND LEROY.

THAT'S IT.

YOU SEE?
THIS WAS MEANT
TO HAPPEN.

OH, IRA.

OH, WAIT.

I GOT LIPSTICK ON YOU.
I BETTER GET IT OFF.

JUST LEAVE IT THERE.

WOULDN'T HURT FIONA
TO SEE THAT
YOU DON'T GET PETRIFIED

JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 30 YEARS.

29.

IT JUST
SEEMS LONGER.

WHAT?

IT WAS A JOKE,
MY DOVE.

THEY HAVE THE NERVE
TO CALL THIS
A BOULEVARD.

WE'RE JUST DROPPING BY
TO SAY HELLO, ALL RIGHT?

NO RAKING OVER THE PAST.

PROMISE ME,
OR I DRIVE RIGHT BY.

THIS WHOLE THING
IS A MISTAKE.

DON'T DRAG IT OUT.

DO I LOOK OLD, IRA?

DO I?
TELL ME.

IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

THANKS A WHOLE HEAP.

WHOA, THERE!

OHH...

LEROY.

OH, THAT SWEET
DEAR LITTLE THING.

IRA, SHE LOOKS
SO UNDERNOURISHED.

SHE LOOKS
PART DOBERMAN TO ME.

OHH.

AHH.

WELL...

I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU REMEMBER ME.

WELL, I'M YOUR GRANDMA.

MY GRANDMA
IS AT THE STORE SHOPPING
THIS VERY MINUTE.

WELL, I'M
YOUR OTHER GRANDMA.

GRANDMA MORAN...

UH, FROM YOUR FATHER'S
SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

AND THIS IS
YOUR GRANDPA.

OH.

OH.

YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE ME, HMM?

WELL...

I WAS STANDING BY
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

AND YOU SPENT
THE FIRST EIGHT
OR NINE MONTHS

OF YOUR LIFE
WITH US.

WHY?

WELL, BECAUSE YOUR MOMMY
AND YOUR DADDY

WERE STAYING WITH US THEN.

AND WE BROUGHT YOU
A KITTEN...

FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY
WHEN YOU WERE 1...

THIS LITTLE
STRIPED KITTEN.

I DON'T REMEMBER.

NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

YOU WERE SO ALLERGIC,
WE HAD TO TAKE IT BACK.

WE TOOK IT TO BALTIMORE.

DO YOU STILL HAVE IT?

I'M NOT
SO ALLERGIC ANYMORE.

NO.

UNFORTUNATELY,

THE POOR
SWEET LITTLE THING
WAS RUN OVER

VERY SHORTLY
THEREAFTER.

THAT'S WHY
I DON'T LIKE
BALTIMORE.

TOO MUCH TRAFFIC.

YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

IS YOUR MOMMY HOME?

MA!

UH...

WELL...

HI.

SURPRISE.

I HEARD YOU
ON THE RADIO
THIS MORNING,

SO WE--

WE THOUGHT
WE'D STOP BY

AND WISH YOU WELL.

WELL...

WELL, ACTUALLY,

WE WERE IN
THIS NECK OF THE WOODS,

UH, FOR
MAX GILL'S FUNERAL.

YOU REMEMBER MAX GILL.

MY FRIEND SERENA'S
HUSBAND MAX.

WELL, ANYWAY,

HE--HE DIED OF CANCER,

SO I SAID
WHY DON'T WE STOP BY
AND VISIT FIONA?

UH, THE RADIO?

UH, A.M. BALTIMORE.

IT FEELS FUNNY
TO SEE YOU.

FUNNY?

I--I MEAN...

UH, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME INSIDE?

OH, YEAH.

WELL, JUST FOR A MINUTE.

WE'VE GOT A MINUTE,
HAVEN'T WE?

UH, YEAH,
JUST ABOUT.

WELL...

WE WERE SO SURPRISED
TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR WEDDING PLANS.

IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE A JOKE?

WELL, I...

I--I COULD'VE SWORN
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT

THIS MORNING
ON THE RADIO.

WPED.

YOU KNOW,

THE MEL SPRUCE
CALL-IN SHOW.

THEY WERE DISCUSSING
WHAT IT TAKES

FOR AN IDEAL MARRIAGE.

WELL, IT SURE
WASN'T ME.

THE ONLY STATION
I LISTEN TO

IS WZBN.

WELL, CAN YOU
IMAGINE THAT?

WELL...

I--I--I
COULD'VE SWORN
IT WAS YOU.

I ALWAYS
THOUGHT YOU HAD
SUCH A NICE VOICE.

I'D HARDLY
SAY THAT.

WELL, SO, UH...

HOW'S LITTLE DAISY?

OH, SHE'S NOT
SO LITTLE ANYMORE.

SHE'S HEADING OFF
TO COLLEGE TOMORROW.

WELL, I'M IN
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL MYSELF

RIGHT NOW.

OH,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL?

ELECTROLYSIS.

OH, I THINK
THAT'S LOVELY.

THE BEAUTY PARLOR
WHERE I WORK

AS A SHAMPOO TECHNICIAN
IS PAYING FOR THE COURSE--

TUITION AND SUPPLIES.

THEY WANT THEIR OWN
LICENSED OPERATOR.

OH, IRA,

ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

I COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE IT.

SHOW THEM
YOUR PRACTICE KIT, MA.

OH, OH, YES.

SHOW ME.

SHOW US.

YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT.

WE DO.

ABSOLUTELY.

WELL, THEN,
WAIT A SEC.

THEY'RE GOING
TO HANG A SIGN
IN THE WINDOW,

PROFESSIONALLY PAINTED
WITH MA'S NAME ON IT.

ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

IT'S GENUINE SCIENCE
MA SAYS.

YOU HAVE TO HAVE
TRAINED EXPERTS

TO TEACH YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

UH, FIRST WE PRACTICE
WITH A DUMMY INSTRUMENT.

AHEM.

WE HAVE TO WORK ON
GETTING THE ANGLE

EXACTLY RIGHT.

AHEM.

SEE, UH...

YOU TRAVEL

INTO THE FOLLICLE...

EASY.

EASY.

OH!

IF THIS WERE
A REAL PERSON,

I WOULD'VE BEEN
LEANING ON HER EYEBALL.

I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SMUSH YOU.

DOES THE SCHOOL
SUPPLY THE SPONGES?

YES, IT'S INCLUDED
IN THE TUITION.

TELL HIM
ABOUT THE SIGN, MA,

WITH YOUR NAME
PROFESSIONALLY
PAINTED ON IT.

WELL...

WHEN I GRADUATE,

I'LL HAVE A SIGN READING,

"FIONA MORAN,

"LICENSED ELECTROLOGIST,

PAINLESS REMOVAL
OF SUPERFLUOUS HAIR."

FIONA MORAN.

I LIKE THAT.

I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS SO MUCH
SUPERFLUOUS HAIR AROUND.

OH, THERE'S A BIG FUTURE
IN THE BUSINESS

THE WAY FASHIONS
ARE GOING TO THE SKIMPY.

THERE'S A SMALL FORTUNE
IN UNWANTED HAIR.

YOU GOT A BALL
TO GO WITH THAT GLOVE?

WHAT DO YOU SAY
LET'S GO OUTSIDE?

I'LL THROW YOU A FEW.

I'LL CHECK
YOUR STUFF OUT.

ISN'T THAT SWEET?

SHE'LL WEAR HIM OUT
AND LEAVE HIM FOR DEAD.

DOES SHE EVER
MENTION HER DADDY?

NO MORE THAN
HE MENTIONS HER,
I'LL BET.

WELL, TELL ME.

DO YOU HAVE
ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
THESE DAYS, FIONA?

OH, SHOOT.

I JUST BARELY
GET TO DATE AT ALL.

THERE WAS
THIS ONE GUY--
MARK DERBY.

I GAVE HIM UP
LIKE LIGHTNING

WHEN HE GOT SO NASTY

JUST 'CAUSE
I BASHED IN HIS CAR.

YOU WERE VERY WISE.

I MEAN,
JUST A LITTLE BASH.

I TOTALED IT.

JESSE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
EITHER, YOU MIGHT SAY.

I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D SAY

HE EVER HAD ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR.

HEY, HOW ABOUT A BEER?

OH, I'D LOVE A BEER.

ONLY THING WE GOT
IS LIGHT.

IS THAT O.K.?

OH, THAT'S PERFECT.

I'M ON A DIET.

OHH.

I WONDER IF
CLAUDINE AND PETER
EVER GOT MARRIED.

WHO?

YOU REMEMBER.

THE--THE SOAP OPERA
WE USED TO WATCH.

HIS SISTER...

NATASHA...

WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO SPLIT THEM UP.

OH, LORD. NATASHA.

SHE WAS ONE MEAN LADY.

THEN YOU LEFT US.

YOU KNOW, AT FIRST
I COULD NOT BELIEVE

YOU WERE GONE
FOR GOOD.

I'D COME HOME FROM WORK
AT THE NURSING HOME,

AND I'D SWITCH ON THE TV

TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO CLAUDINE AND PETER

SO I COULD FILL YOU IN
WHEN YOU GOT BACK.

ARE YOU STILL WORKING
AT THAT, UH...

SOMETHING WILLOW...

MM-HMM.

BUT I--I WORK
SHORT HOURS,

SO, UH, IN...
JUST IN CASE, UH...

LEROY EVER WANTED
TO COME AND STAY,

I'M ALWAYS HOME
BY THE TIME
SCHOOL IS OUT.

RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

LOW, INSIDE.

ARE YOU REALLY
MY GRANDFATHER?

YEP.

MY OTHER
GRANDFATHER'S DEAD.

WELL, THIS ONE AIN'T.

AIN'T NO SUCH WORD
AS AIN'T.

THERE AIN'T?

HOW COME I DON'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE YOU?

AH, TAKES A LONG TIME
TO GET THIS UGLY.

I SPENT HOURS
IN THE BEAUTY PARLOR

GETTING READY
FOR THAT DAY

BECAUSE YOU PROMISED
HE WAS COMING.

TO THIS DAY,
IT MAKES ME JUST BOIL.

WELL, DON'T THINK
I DIDN'T TELL HIM

WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME.

OH, SURE.

HE CALLED ME
BECAUSE HE FELT
SORRY FOR ME

BECAUSE LIKE A FOOL,

I'D GONE TO
SO MUCH TROUBLE

THINKING
I WOULD SEE HIM.

THAT IS THE TROUBLE
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

YOU BOTH HAVE SUCH
WARM FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER,

BUT THEY DON'T
GET TURNED ON
AT THE SAME TIME.

JESSE MORAN?

FEELINGS?

I WISH
YOU COULD'VE SEEN HIM

THE WAY I DID
THAT DAY,

LIKE HE'D LOST THE WORLD.

GOOD.

OH, JESSE IS...

IS DIFFERENT.

SURE.

WELL, HE REMEMBERS.

FIONA...

DO YOU KNOW

THAT HIS MOST
CHERISHED BELONGING

IS THAT LITTLE...

LITTLE TORTOISE-SHELL
SOAP DISH OF YOURS?

MY WHAT?

WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW PEOPLE SAY THAT--
THAT CERTAIN SMELLS

SEEM TO STIR UP
OLD MEMORIES.

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
WITH THAT PRETTY
LITTLE SOAP BOX

BECAUSE HE HAS KEPT IT
ALL THIS TIME.

AND SOMETIMES
I WOULD GO IN
TO MAKE UP HIS BED,

AND I WOULD FIND IT
UNDERNEATH HIS PILLOW...

LIKE HAVING YOU NEARBY,
I GUESS.

WHEN YOU FRAME
THOSE THINGS,

CAN YOU TAKE OUT
THE THUMBTACK HOLES?

YEAH, SURE.

WHY?

WELL,

I DREW THIS CRAYON PICTURE
OF A BOAT ON A LAKE,

AND IT WON FIRST PRIZE
IN THE SECOND GRADE
SCHOOL FAIR.

THEN MA WENT AHEAD
AND PINNED IT UP
IN MY ROOM.

I MEAN, SOMEDAY I WANT
TO PUT IT IN A FRAME,

BUT I DON'T WANT
THE HOLES TO SHOW,

LIKE IT WAS JUST
TORE OUT OF A MAGAZINE.

AN ARTIST
IN THE FAMILY, HUH?

IS MY DAD
AS TALL AS YOU?

NOT QUITE, I GUESS.

DO I LOOK LIKE HIM?

MMM.

YES.

UNFORTUNATELY.

HEH HEH HEH.

I'LL NEVER FORGET
ALL THOSE CLASSES

YOU TRAIPSED ME TO.

SQUAT EXERCISES.

BREATHING LESSONS.

LISTEN,

JUST BE GLAD
YOU HAD THEM.

THE FIRST TIME
I WAS PREGNANT,

THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF THING.

I WAS SO SCARED.

I REMEMBER
LEAVING THE HOSPITAL
WITH JESSE--

AND I STOPPED AND I SAID,
"WAIT A MINUTE,

"ARE THEY GOING TO LET ME
WALK OUT OF HERE WITH HIM?

I DON'T HAVE
A LICENSE TO DO THIS."

IF YOU WANT TO
DRIVE A CAR,

YOU NEED A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO DRIVE A CAR

THAN IT IS TO LIVE
DAY AFTER DAY

WITH A HUSBAND

AND TRY TO RAISE
A BRAND-NEW BABY.

I CAN'T BELIEVE

HE STILL KEEPS
THAT DUMB OLD
SOAPBOX.

IF YOU WANT TO
THROW A CURVE BALL,

GET YOUR FINGERS
RIGHT ACROSS
THOSE SEAMS.

WHEN YOU THROW IT,

IT COMES OUT
LIKE THAT.

YOU DON'T WANT
TO THROW A CURVE

BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

THEY TAKE IT
AND SNAP IT
LIKE THAT.

DOES HE STILL
LOOK THE SAME?

YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

'COURSE, HE'S--

HE'S...KIND OF MORE
GROWN-UP HANDSOME,

YOU MIGHT SAY.

SOMETIMES I THINK
I SHOULD'VE JUST

FIRED OFF
ANOTHER TELEGRAM.

ANOTHER TELEGRAM?

OH, YEAH.

I DON'T SUPPOSE HE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE TELEGRAM.

NO.

WELL,

WHEN HE DIDN'T
NOTICE ME AT FIRST--

HE WAS JUST THIS BOY
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT

AND HE WAS GETTING
THIS BAND TOGETHER--

I SENT HIM A TELEGRAM.

"FIONA STUCKEY WOULD
LIKE TO GO WITH YOU

TO DEEP CREEK LAKE."

I KNEW HE WAS GOING THERE
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

GOSH, CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW CORNY?

IS THAT HOW
THAT HAPPENED?

WELL, IT
CERTAINLY MADE JESSE

SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE.

I DON'T THINK
IT WAS CORNY AT ALL.

IT GOT RESULTS.

SHOOT, THERE HAVE
BEEN TIMES

WHEN I THINK I'LL JUST
FIRE OFF ANOTHER TELEGRAM.

"JESSE," I'D SAY,

"I LOVE YOU STILL...

AND IT BEGINS TO SEEM
I ALWAYS WILL."

OH...

FIONA...

I THINK THAT IS
SIMPLY LOVELY.

MAYBE I SHOULD
RIDE BACK DOWN
WITH YOU.

YES!

WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!

THEN, UH...
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T.

OH, NO. GO WITH
YOUR FIRST IMPULSE.

I SHOULDN'T DRINK
IN THE DAYTIME.

IT MAKES MY HEAD
SO MUZZY.

NO, IT IS
A LOVELY IDEA.

WELL...

MOSTLY FOR LEROY,
OF COURSE.

WE COULD...

TAKE THE BUS BACK
TOMORROW.

SHE'S GOT TO
BE IN SCHOOL MONDAY.

JESSE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO KNOW.

NOT REALLY.

I MEAN...

YOU'RE LEROY'S
GRANDPARENTS.

THAT'S THE POINT.

OH!

I AM SO PLEASED.

OH, WHAT
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

WE HAD NO IDEA.

WE WERE JUST
GOING TO STOP BY.

OH, FIONA.

I AM SO EXCITED!

OH!

OHH.

OH.

WHO'S THAT STRANGER,
LEROY?

THIS IS
MY GRANDFATHER.

MRS. STUCKEY.

OH, MR. MORAN.
MY, MY.

YOU MUST BE LOST, HUH?

LET ME HELP YOU.

NO, NO.

YOU TWO
JUST STAY PUT.

BELIEVE HALF
OF WHAT HE SAYS

AND FORGET
THE OTHER HALF,

YOU'LL COME OUT
AHEAD, LEROY.

OH.

I WAS JUST
TELLING FIONA

HOW NICE IT WAS
WE WERE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

ONE THING I DESPISE

IS THESE NEW-STYLE
PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS

WITH THE HANDLES
THAT CUT YOUR
FINGERS IN HALF.

HOW ARE YOU?

ALSO THEY FALL OVER
IN THE CAR.

I'M ALL RIGHT,
I SUPPOSE.

WE JUST STOPPED BY
FOR A SECOND.

WE'VE BEEN TO A FUNERAL
OVER IN DEERLICK.

MMM.

MMM.

I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TALK FIONA

INTO COMING HOME WITH US
FOR A LITTLE VISIT.

FAT CHANCE OF THAT.

WELL, SHE THINKS
SHE MIGHT DO IT.

ME AND LEROY
MIGHT GO.

JUST FOR
THE WEEKEND.

I'D SOONER SEE YOU
LAYING IN YOUR CASKET.

MA!

THE WEEKEND'S
HALF OVER.

WHERE'S THE HURT?

JESSE MORAN'D BE
NOWHERES ABOUT,
I SUPPOSE.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
JUST ONE SINGLE NIGHT.

YEAH, YEAH.

THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
THE LAST TIME,
AS I REMEMBER.

MA!

FIONA,
USE YOUR HEAD.

I AM USING MY HEAD.

I'M TAKING LEROY
TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH HER GRANDPARENTS.

NOT THOSE GRANDPARENTS.

THEY'RE VERY NICE
PEOPLE.

LOOK WHAT
THEY BROUGHT UP.

JESSE MAY HAVE
CHANGED.

THE DAY JESSE MORAN
CHANGES,

PIGS WILL FLY
AND COWS WILL TALK.


CHICK'S CYCLE SHOP.

MAY I SPEAK TO
JESSE, PLEASE?

JESSE MORAN?

HOLD ON.

JESSE.

IT'S YOUR MOM.

MOM, WHERE ARE YOU?

I'M STANDING
IN FIONA'S BEDROOM.

JESSE,
DON'T HANG UP.

MA.

SHOULD'VE KNOWN
YOU'D PULL SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
MY ONLY SON

TO COME TO SUPPER
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIS SISTER

AND TO SEE HIS
FLESH-AND-BLOOD
DAUGHTER

FOR JUST A LITTLE
OF HIS PRECIOUS TIME?

FIONA WOULD TAKE OFF
IF I SHOW UP,

DRAGGING LEROY WITH HER.

THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW.

FIONA TOLD ME
SHE HAS THOUGHT
OF SENDING YOU

ANOTHER TELEGRAM.

I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST ONE,

WHICH I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT
UNTIL TODAY.

AND SHE HAS BEEN
COMPOSING ANOTHER ONE
IN HER MIND

ALL THIS TIME,

AND IT'S GOING TO SAY,

"JESSE,
I LOVE YOU STILL,

AND IT SEEMS
I ALWAYS WILL."

NEVER GIVE UP,
DO YOU?

YOU THINK I COULD
MAKE THAT UP?

I'M REMEMBERING IT
BECAUSE IT HAS
SUCH A NICE RHYME.

LOOK, IF I SHOW UP,

WHAT TIME DO WE EAT?

UH, UH, 7:30.

JESSE, YOU MAKE ME
SO HAPPY.

THANK YOU.

YOU'RE GOING
TO GO BACK
WITH THAT BOY

AND GET
SNAGGLED UP.

WHO SAID I'M GETTING
ALL SNAGGLED AGAIN?

I'M JUST PAYING
A WEEKEND VISIT.

HE'LL HAVE YOU
RUNNING CIRCLES
AROUND HIM,

SAME AS BEFORE.

I'M 25 YEARS OLD.

I'M NOT THAT SAME
LITTLE SNIPPET

I USED TO BE.

LEROY, YOU BETTER
GET IN HERE

AND TELL ME THE THINGS
YOU WANT TO TAKE WITH YOU.

IF I WERE
TRAVELING ALONE,

I'D MAKE DO WITH
JUST A TOOTHBRUSH,

BUT ONCE
YOU GOT A KID...

PAJAMAS, COMICS.

OH!

AND HER BASEBALL MITT.

SHE HAS TO HAVE
HER BASEBALL MITT.

YOU NEVER KNOW

WHEN YOU MIGHT
RUSTLE UP A GAME,
SHE SAYS.

IT'S TRUE.
YOU NEVER DO.

WHILE YOU WERE
TALKING HER INTO IT

AND SNEAKING
A LONG-DISTANCE CALL
ON THEIR PHONE,

THERE'S ONE THING
YOU SHOULD'VE
REMEMBERED.

IRA, DON'T TRY
TO SPOIL IT.

WE'RE DRIVING
DAISY TO COLLEGE

BRIGHT AND EARLY
TOMORROW MORNING.

OH, THAT.

OH, THAT.

GRANDMA!

SHOULD WE ASK YOUR MOTHER
TO MOVE HER CAR?

I'D RATHER GO
FOR ROOT CANAL

THAN ASK HER
FOR A FAVOR

AT THIS GIVEN MOMENT.

NEVER FEAR. DRIVING
IS IN MY GENES.

BYE.

ARE YOU SURE
I SHOULDN'T ASK HER--

SIT.

YAY!

â™ª OH, SHE'LL BE â™ª

â™ª COMIN' AROUND THE MOUNTAIN
WHEN SHE COMES â™ª

â™ª SHE'LL BE COMIN'
AROUND THE MOUNTAIN â™ª

â™ª WHEN SHE COMES â™ª

â™ª SHE'LL BE
COMIN' AROUND THE MOUNTAIN â™ª

â™ª SHE'LL BE COMIN'
AROUND THE MOUNTAIN â™ª

â™ª SHE'LL BE
COMIN' AROUND THE MOUNTAIN â™ª

â™ª WHEN SHE COMES â™ªâ™ª

I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

MOM!

THINK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

LEROY, WE WILL STOP
AT THE SUPERMARKET

AND GET SOMETHING
FOR SUPPER.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

SHE'D LIVE
ON HOT DOGS
IF YOU LET HER.

YOUR FRIED CHICKEN
IS NICE.

YOU REMEMBERED.

DO YOU LIKE
FRIED CHICKEN?

SHE LOVES
FRIED CHICKEN.

YOUR DADDY LOVES
FRIED CHICKEN.

MAYBE IT'S INHERITED.

99% OF AMERICA
LIKES FRIED CHICKEN.

THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

MA, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM!

I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT
IS HOW BAD IT IS.

WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
BEFORE WE LEFT?

HOW COULD I?

WE TORE OUT OF THERE
LIKE IT WAS A FIRE DRILL.

DON'T ADAPT
THAT TONE OF VOICE
WITH ME.

IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE
THAT THIS
PARTICULAR PROBLEM

IS NEVER SOLVED
BY DEBATE.

FIONA,

WE'RE DRIVING DAISY
TO COLLEGE TOMORROW.

I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF YOU CATCH AN EARLY BUS.

IT'S NOT THAT EARLY.
REALLY.

THIS WHOLE THING
IS STUPID.

NO, IT IS NOT.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

WHAT WAS I THINKING?

THIS WHOLE THING WAS
A BIG INCONVENIENCE

FOR EVERYONE
INVOLVED.

FIONA, IT IS NOT.
I PROMISE YOU.

NOT AT ALL.

GET OUR STUFF
OUT OF THE TRUNK.

NO.
WE'LL CATCH THAT BUS.

HEY, HOLD UP.

TWO MORE FOR CARTWHEEL.

YOU HAD TO DO IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

ALL I DID
WAS MENTION REALITY.

YOU AND REALITY
OUGHT TO GO STEADY.

FIONA, I DIDN'T MEAN
YOU WEREN'T WELCOME.

COME ON, IRA.
HURRY UP.

LEROY, GET YOUR
BASEBALL MITT
OFF THE BACKSEAT.

ALL I DID WAS
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

OH, OF COURSE,
HONEY.

LISTEN, FIONA,

I'VE GOT TO
CONFESS SOMETHING.

WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WOULD COME
FOR A VISIT,

I WENT UPSTAIRS
AND MADE A SNEAK
PHONE CALL TO JESSE

ON YOUR
BEDROOM PHONE.

YOU WHAT?

I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.

I'M SORRY,
AND I'LL PAY FOR IT,

BUT HE PROMISED
HE'D COME TO SUPPER.

BUT THAT ROOM'S
SUCH A MESS.

I DON'T RECALL
IF I MADE MY BED.

IT WAS NEAT
AS A PIN.

WELL, WHAT DID
HIS MAJESTY SAY?

HE SAID, UH...

HE SAID HE WOULDN'T
MISS IT FOR ALL THE...

RICE IN TIMBUKTU.

WELL, THAT
SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

HEY, LADY.

I'M DRIVING
THIS BUS NORTH.

YOU WITH ME OR AGIN ME?

I DON'T THINK
I LIKE YOUR TONE.

THEN YOU SURE AIN'T
GONNA LIKE MY DRIVING.

I DON'T LIKE
HIS TONE EITHER,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

WELL, THAT MAKES
FOUR OF US.

AND IT'S NOT
A BASEBALL MITT.

IT'S A GLOVE.

I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WERE LISTENING.

MY DAD ISN'T GOING
TO BE OFF DOING
A CONCERT, IS HE?

LEROY,

LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING--

IRA, LISTEN!

WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO ON

AND HOP
IN THE CAR

AND DRIVE,
ALL RIGHT?

WE'RE LATE,
ALL RIGHT?

WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE MARKET.

ME AND MA
LIKE DRUMSTICKS,

AND SOMETIMES
ME AND MA EAT THIGHS,

BUT WE DON'T THINK WINGS
ARE WORTH THE BOTHER.

IT'S NOT "ME AND MA."

REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU.

IT'S "MA AND ME."

LOOKS LIKE DAISY
ISN'T HOME YET.

LEROY, THE TV SET
IS BROKEN,

BUT WE HAVE A LOT
OF YOUR DAD'S OLD
RECORD COLLECTION.

O.K.

LOOKS LIKE HE
AIN'T COMING, HUH?

IT'S EARLY.

YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
KNOW THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "EARLY"

IF I REMEMBER.

IF HE PROMISED
HE'LL BE HERE,
HE'LL BE HERE.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
GRANDPA?

OH, YOU CAN
COUNT ON IT.

LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK.

I KNEW HE WASN'T COMING.

I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT
BEFORE WE LEFT.

IT'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES
AFTER 7:30.

YOU KNOW HOW JESSE IS
ABOUT CLOCKS.

IT'S FUNNY HOW MUCH
YOU FORGET.

WELL, HE ALWAYS OPENS
THAT FRONT DOOR

WITH A BANG.

THAT I REMEMBER.

YOU SEE? AHA!

LEROY ASKED ME
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC
HER FATHER PLAYS--

NEW WAVE, PUNK,
OR HEAVY METAL.

I THINK SHE WANTED
TO IMPRESS HER FRIENDS.

I TOLD HER I HAVEN'T
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

BY NOW IT COULD BE
ANYTHING.

[MUSIC PLAYS]

WELL, I THINK
SHE JUST FOUND OUT.

IRA, DID YOU FORGET
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

TO HAVE A KID
IN THE HOUSE?

YEAH. I THOUGHT A PLANE
CRASHED INTO THE ROOF.

STILL MUSIC
TO MY EARS.

I'LL TAKE YOUR BAGS
UPSTAIRS.

OH, NO.

I'LL DO IT.

I SHOULD FRESHEN UP
A LITTLE ANYWAY.

IS THE OLD ROOM
WHERE IT ALWAYS WAS?

OH, YEAH.

IT'S STILL
HOME SWEET HOME.

IRA.

HI.

HI.

YOU LEROY?

I'M YOUR DAD.

I JUST CAME BY
FOR SUPPER.

THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
POSING FOR A JEANS AD
OR SOMETHING.

[MUSIC PLAYS]

YOU LISTEN TO THAT?

WELL...

YOU WANT
SOME BETTER MUSIC
THAN THAT.

THAT ALBUM'S JUST
WAY TOO POPULAR
WITH THE MASSES.

YEAH?

YEAH.

PLAY BALL OR GOT
ONE COLD HAND?

I'M GOING TO BE
THE FIRST
WOMAN MANAGER

OF A MAJOR LEAGUE
TEAM.

WOULDN'T CARE
TO BE ON IT.

DON'T KNOW IF YOU
COULD MAKE IT.

JESSE!

OHH!

JESSE.

GRANDPA.

HIYA, FIONA.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.

IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU, TOO, JESSE.

LEROY'S
GROWN A FOOT.

YOU CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR THAT JUST 'CAUSE--

I WASN'T
BLAMING ANYBODY.

OH, I KNOW.

I'M JUST A LITTLE
SNAPPY TODAY.

IT'S JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES.

I WAS UPSTAIRS
HUNTING MY SOAPBOX.

SOAPBOX?

OH!

YOU REMEMBER
HER SOAPBOX.

I--

I CAN'T SAY
AS I DO.

YOU--YOU KEPT IT
WHEN SHE LEFT.

I SAW YOU WITH IT.

IT WAS A LITTLE SOAPBOX.

IT HAD SOAP IN IT.

THAT KIND
YOU CAN SEE THROUGH.
REMEMBER THAT?

SURE.

YOUR MOTHER SAID
YOU KEPT IT.

YOU KEPT IT
IN THAT OLD
TREASURE DRAWER

'CAUSE IT
REMINDED YOU OF ME.

IT SMELLED LIKE ME.

SHE SAID YOU
CLOSED YOUR EYES

AND HELD IT
TO YOUR NOSE.

MOM...

YOU SAID I SNIFFED
SOAPBOXES?

WELL, I--NO--
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

WHAT DO YOU
TAKE ME FOR,
SOME KIND OF LOSER?

DO YOU THINK I'D COME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

LIKE AN ORDINARY GROUPIE

IF YOUR MOTHER
HADN'T TOLD ME THAT?

SHE SAID YOU WOULDN'T
LET CRYSTAL PACK IT.

I JUST--
MOM!

HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!

JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

LET'S GET
SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

JUST LEAVE MAGGIE
OUT OF THIS.

MAGGIE ONLY WANTS THE BEST
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

SO SHE MADE UP SOME STORY
ABOUT A SOAPBOX.

SO WHAT.

I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEVER.

TROUBLE IS,
IT'S JUST WASTED

ON THE TWO OF YOU.

MAGGIE JUST
BELIEVES THAT...

THE PEOPLE SHE LOVES
ARE BETTER THAN THEY ARE,

AND IF THAT'S A FAULT,
IT'S YOURS,

NOT HERS.

THE TRUTH IS,

JESSE HAS
HIS OWN APARTMENT NOW.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S SLEEPING WITH,

BUT I'M SURE IT ISN'T
ANY SOAPBOX.

YOU HAD TO
SPOIL THINGS.

OH, MAGGIE,
IT'S THE SIMPLE TRUTH

THAT SPOILED THINGS.

CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

AM I WRONG, JESSE?

IF I AM, TELL ME.

YOU JUST DUCKED IN HERE
OUT OF CURIOSITY.

AFTER SUPPER,
YOU'LL DUCK OUT
JUST AS FAST

BEFORE YOUR MOTORCYCLE
EVEN COOLS OFF.

YOU DON'T
KEEP GIRLFRIENDS

ANY LONGER
THAN YOU KEEP JOBS.

ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOUR GIRL TURNS OUT
TO BE A BIMBO

AND YOUR BOSSES,
BY SOME MAGICAL COINCIDENCE,

TURN OUT TO BE JERKS.

I WON'T BE A PARTY

TO YOUR BRINGING
YOUR EX-WIFE AND
DAUGHTER DOWN HERE

UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
I WISHED I WAS WRONG...

IF I'M WRONG, JESSE,
TELL ME.

I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.
WE'D ALL LOVE TO HEAR IT.

OH, YOU, JE--

JE--

OH.

JESSE'S JUST
UPSET, HONEY.

OH, JUST STOP IT!

BOTH OF YOU.

I'M TIRED TO DEATH
OF JESSE MORAN,

AND I'M TIRED
OF THE TWO OF YOU.

THE SAME
DUMB ARGUMENTS
AND BICKERING.

IRA ALWAYS
SO RIGHTEOUS

AND MAGGIE ALWAYS
TRYING TO PATCH,
PATCH, PATCH

SOMETHING THAT'S
BEYOND FIXING.

WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG?

WE'RE ALL JUST
TIRED AND HUNGRY.

WE'LL ALL FEEL BETTER

AFTER WE'VE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT.

JESSE WILL BE BACK.

I PROMISE.

YOU'LL SEE.

EVERYTHING'S READY
BACK THERE.

I'LL JUST GO
AND MAKE SURE
IT ISN'T BURNING.

LEROY!

HONEY, WHAT KIND
OF VEGETABLES DO YOU WANT,

PEAS OR BEANS?

LEROY?

YOO-HOO!

LEROY?

FIONA?

FIONA, LEROY,
ARE YOU UP THERE?

WHAT KIND OF VEGETABLES
DO YOU WANT?

ARE THEY THERE?

THERE'S NOBODY
UP HERE.

LOOK OUT
ON THE PORCH.

OH.

YOU TWO,

YOU OUT HERE?

THEY'VE GONE,
MAGGIE.

THEY CAN'T BE.

THEIR LUGGAGE
IS STILL HERE.

NO, HONEY,
THEY'RE ON FOOT.

IT WAS TOO HEAVY
TO CARRY.

BUT--NO...
ON FOOT.

FIONA'S SISTER LIVES
OVER NEAR BROADWAY.

MAGGIE, NO.

YES, I BET--

FIONA!

LEROY!

FIONA!

LEROY!

LEROY!

MAGGIE, HONEY.

AH...

AH...

LET'S GO HOME.

WHAT?

LET'S GO HOME
IN CASE THEY COME BACK.

THEY WON'T COME BACK.

HONEY, YOU WANT
SOME FROZEN YOGURT?

NO, THANKS.

ALL YOU HAD FOR DINNER
WAS JUST A DRUMSTICK.

I'M NOT HUNGRY.

WHERE ARE ALL
YOUR TEDDY BEARS?

IN THE BIG SUITCASE.

I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

I CHANGED MY MIND.

WELL, IF YOU NEED
ANY HELP, LET ME KNOW.

THANKS, MOM.

CARE FOR SOME
FROZEN YOGURT?

MMM, NO, THANKS.

GUESS I SHOULDN'T
EITHER.

BUT...

TRAVEL IS
SUCH A STRAIN.

I FEEL AS THOUGH
I'VE BURNED OFF

ABOUT
A MILLION CALORIES

JUST SITTING
IN THAT CAR.

LEROY REALLY
TOOK TO YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

I PROMISED I'D FRAME
HER SECOND GRADE

PRIZE-WINNING
CRAYON DRAWING

AND TAKE THE THUMBTACK HOLES
OUT OF THE CORNERS.

CAN YOU DO THAT?

I'M FAMOUS FOR IT.

I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE'LL BE

ALL THAT GLAD
TO SEE US AGAIN.

OH, I THINK
SHE'LL BE EXPECTING US.

SHE FORGOT
HER BASEBALL GLOVE.

NOT REALLY.

SHE LEFT IT ON
THE STEERING WHEEL
OF THE CAR

SO WE COULDN'T MISS IT.

OH.

THAT LITTLE DEVIL.

DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE HER?

NOW BE HONEST.

I LOVE HER GRANDMA.

DOES THAT COUNT?

WASN'T CARTWHEEL DINKY?

HMM.

I FORGOT HOW DINKY.

I'LL BET THEIR SCHOOL
IS DINKY, TOO.

DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE CARTWHEEL SCHOOL

OFFERS
A GOOD EDUCATION?

I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.

WELL, I CAN. I BET
IT'S AT LEAST A YEAR

BEHIND THE
BALTIMORE SCHOOLS.
MAYBE TWO.

THE BALTIMORE SCHOOLS
ARE REALLY SUPERB.

WELL, THEY'RE
CERTAINLY BETTER
THAN CARTWHEEL'S.

YOU KNOW
WHAT WE COULD DO?

WE COULD WRITE TO FIONA

AND ASK HER IF SHE'S
GIVEN ANY THOUGHT

TO LEROY'S EDUCATION.

THEN WE COULD SUGGEST

THAT WE ENROLL HER INTO
THE BALTIMORE SCHOOLS

AND SHE COULD COME
AND STAY WITH US.

NO.

NO.

SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

WITH THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

WE'VE MANAGED
FOR 29 YEARS.

WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

HMM.

OH.

OH.

AH, WHAT--
OH, HERE.

HA HA.

RIGHT?

MM-HMM.

THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.

MMM.

AHA!
