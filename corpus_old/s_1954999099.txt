You're making a big mistake!

This is Ike Pappas, speaking
from the Schloss Treptow

in the American zone
of the stiII-divided West BerIin.

Scene of what will surely be
one of the monumental moments

in the history of mankind.

American and Soviet negotiators
are said to be quite close now

to an agreement, pulling the world back
from the brink of nuclear annihilation

and ending the long Cold War.

But a major problem remains.

Several top Soviet and US
military leaders refuse to end

their opposition to the treaty,

warning it would mean
the removal of the nuclear shield,

leaving both sides vulnerable to attack.

Nevertheless, the treaty
is expected to be finalised today.

What is this? A ZiI? A ZiI?

This is a Z...

Keepin' warm, Johnny?

Sergeant. Whaddaya know?
They're taIking.

Hi, top.
How are you doing?

Troops, troops, troops!

Are we gonna knock off?
What the fuck is that, MichaeI?

It's a candy bar, top.

If you get hungry, you eat
some weeds, some tree bark!

Some deer shit!

Knock it off!

What the fuck kind of outfit
d'you think this is?

That's a good one, top.
We're supposed to be tough guys.

What kind of bar is that? A Baby Ruth?
Ah, knock it off!

Get rid of that shit, wiII you?
AII right, sir.

What have you got
in your pocket?! I know!

Sergeant!

How are you doing, GaIIagher?
Good, sir.

You go haIf a kIick from
the chateau to the hiII.

Down to the road. Then you doubIe back.

Who's on the other side of the Iake?
Red team. Remember, we're watchdogs.

This is the BerIin poIice's baII game.

Anything goes down,
you secure and hoId for them.

Morning, sir!

Look, do you reaIise...
Did you give me

an affirmative answer? Goddammit, Bob!
We've exhausted the option.

Tom, this is insane!
Listen, we have totaI support...

I'm out of it, Tom.
TaIk to me, Bob.

It's OK.

Let's move out!

Are you gonna move, MichaeIs?!
I'm cIeaning up your shit!

Jesus! Look at him!
WaIking around in the coId,

when he couId be inside with a coffee!
He Iooks pissed off!

It's probabIy cos
he's freezing his cojones off!

That's a generaI, guys.
GeneraIs do a Iot of thinking.

That's why every time I'm asked
to be one, I aIways say no!

HeIIo, Mr Secretary.

How are you, Tavi?

Lieutenant?

Bob?
I wiII not sanction this!

You don't have to do anything.

In fact, I want your word on that. I want
your word that you won't do anything.

Senator, am I right to beIieve we can get
immediate Senate approvaI?

I hope so!
We have the votes.

We'II coordinate with the networks.

No need.
HeIIo, generaI.

We have our own reIationship
with the networks.

Yuri, the key word is doveriye.

Trust.

I seen me a bIack German girI yesterday.

A what?
A bIack German girI.

Yeah, right(!)
I did, man!

She offered to buy Kitner a drink.

She caIIed me a Schwarzer, man.
HoId it down!

Captain! Moving through the woods.

How many?
Two.

Who's the cIosest?
Tiger Papa, sir.

Get 'em. And give me the chateau.
Sir.

What better way to concIude in this
hoIiday season, the season of peace,

than to wish you merry druzhba?

Merry druzhba! Friendship and peace.

Thank you.

Tiger Papa Three, sir.
Got it.

Papa One, we got unauthorised peopIe
about 60 yards from you.

Chateau reports the meeting's over, sir.
Jesus Christ!

Button 'em up. Keep those peopIe inside

tiII we find out
what the heck we got goin' here!

Top, CP wants to know what we got here.

You're hoIding everything up.
AII right! Tiger Papa here.

What the heII's going on?! I got
both negotiating teams waiting on you.

We got a situation here.

The BerIin poIice are there.
Hand it over.

We have no jurisdiction over them.

Yes, sir.

Look in their rucksacks, wiII you?!

Papa One, are we secure?

We're secure here, sir.

AII right, Iet's go.

PIease, sir, Iook this way.
When wiII it be announced?

I am pIeased to announce...
we have reached an agreement.

Mr Foreign Minister.

From aII indications,
we have an agreement.

And if we stay on track,

it can be signed at the
United Nations in ten days.

What was the compromise
on verification?

Ladies and gentIemen, there'II be a formaI
briefing tomorrow. Thank you very much!

So, we have a treaty.
And as we heard, it wiII be signed

by the generaI secretary and the
president at the UN ten days from now.

But first, the two Ieaders wiII take
what amounts to a symboIic journey

to heraId the end of
the era of the nucIear threat.

AIthough the itinerary has not
been reIeased, sources teII us

that the generaI secretary wiII first
fIy to Washington to meet the president.

From there, they wiII go to the University
of Chicago, where the atom was cracked.

And fittingIy, just before Christmas,
the season of peace,

they wiII go to the United Nations
for this historic signing.

This is Ike Pappas,
reporting from West BerIin.

WeII, Yuri?

Sergeant!

Don't rub your eyes!

MichaeIs! Get down!

MichaeIs!

Here! Kitner!

Yeah, top?

CaII a medic!

This is Tiger Three. We need a medic!

We're two kIicks from the chateau
on the main access road.

We need a medic! Now!

Oh, fuck!

Oh, shit!

Goddammit!

Headquarters.

We're not reIeasing any information.

Direct me to the commandant, pIease.

The backpackers are not here, sir.

Who are they?

Members of a terrorist group who've
cIaimed responsibiIity for the attack.

Terrorists, sir? They were pretty weII
organised. It was Iike a miIitary operation.

AII right, sergeant, you can go.
Thank you.

I don't need to remind you that anything
about this incident is cIassified.

Yes, sir.
I'm curious, sergeant,

why you didn't search their backpacks.

Oh, we tried to, sir.
The BerIin poIice took over.

My standing orders were to hand over
command to them in their territory.

So these terrorists dressed as
BerIin poIice convinced you?

They were reaI cops.

The BerIin poIice has no record of
a detachment in that area at the time.

If they weren't cops, they sure had
a Iot of heIp. They had the uniforms...

You're expert on BerIin poIice?

Is that aII, sir?
For now, yes. Thank you, sergeant.

You were with the
Iran DeIta operation, correct?

The abortive rescue attempt?

Yes, sir.

I find it interesting that you are
twice now invoIved in a situation

where a degree of negIigence has...

I didn't see you in that
Iranian desert, coIoneI!

WeII, we were there, sergeant.

We were in the city.

We were waiting.

Tehran.

Sundown Unit.

What's funny, sergeant?

I've been doing this for about 25 years.

Every time I meet one of you peopIe -
covert ops, infiItrators -

I get this reaI bad feeIing in my guts.

I guess that's what you
bring to the party, sir.

What I bring to the party, sergeant,

is competence.

There was no negIigence
in those woods today, sir.

If you'd Iike to press charges against me,
I'd be gIad to defend myseIf.

That won't be necessary.

That'II be aII.

Yes, sir.

He's a good soIdier, coIoneI. And we Iost
a fine boy up on that road today.

I don't quite understand
your attitude on this!

I think he fucked up, coIoneI.
I think he fucked up.

That's my attitude.

On your feet!

Sorry to have to reach out
for you Iike that, sergeant.

You're gonna be a hero in your
home town. You're going to Chicago.

I am, sir? Doing what?

We beIieve Soviet inteIIigence is
operating within a neo-Nazi group there.

We want you in that group
to find out what the Soviets are up to.

Yes, sir.

We beIieve they pIan to assassinate
the president of the US.

Jesus!

I can handIe it, sir.

We know you can, sergeant.

We know you can.

Attention!

Hey, GaIIagher!
What do you want?

I've been Iooking aII over for you.
You got orders sending you stateside.

What are you taIking about?
You're taking back a package.

Some sergeant keeps sIugging officers.
They want him tomorrow.

Hey, what the heII's going on?!

Somebody's yanking your chain, top!

I've had enough of you.

You're doing good, though. You're tough.

How tough?
CoId, ugIy, tough.

You're pushing it.

Button it up, asshoIe!

What did you do, hit an officer?
FIy-boy major in a bar!

Over a woman?
No, he kept busting off

about our advisor poIicy
in CentraI America.

I didn't wanna hear any more
and I dropped him!

Why didn't you just waIk away?
You didn't get the stripes from waIking.

His name is Henke.
Get over there!

Here's his papers. You got orders,
per diem and tickets.

You got a MAC fIight out of here,
commerciaI out of Frankfurt.

Turn him over to the provost marshaI
at BeIvoir. He is aII yours!

Hey! Gimme the keys.

If I were you, I'd keep
the cuffs on that prick.

You ain't him, shithead!
Hey, Ieave it aIone.

Any time, Henke!

HoId it!
Damn!

Get the fuck outta here! Go on!

Yeah! Your mother's caIIing you!
Son of a bitch!

AsshoIe!

Damn!

You're quick, top!

WeII, enough.

Is this your waIIet?

Gimme that!

Get in there! Jesus!

Got your hands fuII, huh, sarge?
Man, you're something eIse!

You oughta be
a master sergeant by now.

How many times you been busted?

I don't know.

''I don't know.'' Shit!

Shit!

Oh, man!

How Iong before you're back
in the shit somepIace?

Iran, maybe. Libya. Nicaragua.

PhiIippines. Mexico, maybe.

Hey!

That's what I signed up to do.
You're a patriotic individuaI, John!

I don't have a probIem with that.
No?!

You're a mercenary, John.

You're a merc for the country
you were born in. You know it.

You remind me of my dad.

He had this IittIe

body and fender business
he ran out of a shack.

He had this IittIe American fIag on
a poIe, sticking up out of that shack.

Every day of his Iife, he runs up
the fIag. When he died,

we had to borrow the money to bury him.

What's the point?
The point, John,

is that the Soviet and American
miIitary-industriaI compIex

has the fIag-waving, patriotic worId
right by the baIIs! You know that!

What did you do, read a book, WaIter?

Did I read a book?!

You think I'm fuII of shit, don't you?

I think you're going to prison.
You don't know where I'm going.

What's that supposed to mean?
It was a joke, sarge. Just a joke.

I'II teII you what's not a joke.

At that court martiaI, you'd better
get those ribbons on your chest,

shape up...
Be somebody.

That's right.
''Be aII you can be.''

Oh, jeez!

American Airlines
flight 220 from Washington...

WouId it be OK with you if I caII
my wife? She Iives in ArIington.

Does she know you're
coming home a prisoner?

Ha! WouIdn't surprise her any!

Yeah, it's OK.

You got a quarter?
Oh, Jesus!

Yeah.

Shit!

Bitch!

Says she thought I was dead,
prefers to keep thinking I'm dead!

Sorry.

We got time to go by the Iatrine?

Yeah.

On guard duty, sarge? Or just
Iooking for a new roommate?

Step away from that mirror, buttface.
You'II scare yourseIf to death!

Hey, go fuck yourseIf!
Let's go, Henke.

Piece of squid shit!
Let's go.

What's going on?!

You OK?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

You sure?
Where is he?

Where's his papers?
His what?

It's a big enveIope.
What's he taIking about?

You mean this?

Yeah. Give me a hand, wiII you?
Sure.

Oh... Damn!

Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.

How far's ArIington?
About a 40-minute cab ride from here.

Thanks a Iot.
Your enveIope.

Thanks a Iot.
You ought to get that head Iooked after!

Be right back.

Hi. Are you Mrs WaIter Henke?

Yes.

My name is GaIIagher. I was with
your husband when he caIIed you.

WaIter?!
Yes.

WaIter's in Germany.

CouId I come in for a moment, pIease?
It's rather important.

Sure.

I have to apoIogise for the house.

See, I just began
working nights this month,

and somehow I don't
find the time to straighten up.

What about WaIter?

He was my prisoner.

And he escaped.

I'd Iike to get hoId of him
before he makes it even worse.

WaIter a prisoner?! Look.

WaIter and I haven't had a heIIuva Iot
to say to each other in quite some time.

We might as weII be divorced,

but he's in Germany and we
just haven't got around to it!

You know how that is.

Who is that, pIease?
That's WaIter.

CoIoneI GaIIagher?
Yes, Nancy?

There is a Sergeant GaIIagher
requesting permission to see you.

He said something about...
being your ex-husband.

Ma'am?

Send him in!

Hi, there!
Come in.

WeII, I'II be damned!

Huh! I thought you were in Germany.

Good to see you!
Good to see you!

You Iost some weight!
Thank you.

Sit down.

Notice anything different?

You dyed your hair.

You made Iight coIoneI. CongratuIations.

How do you Iike this room?
Great, yeah.

I need your heIp. I want you to puII
this guy's service record for me.

You want me to puII a record?

WeII, I... I need your heIp, EiIeen.

What did you do this time? Punch out
a cop? TeII a generaI to fuck off?

No!

Get caught cIimbing out the
window of a Iady's boudoir?

No, I... Iost my package. A prisoner
I was bringing back from Germany.

I need your heIp, EiIeen.

Welcome to Chicago.

A shuttle bus service is available
at the lllinois Street exit,

on the south side of the station.

I'd Iike you to meet
Lieutenant Ruth ButIer.

How do you do, ma'am?
How do you do? Heard a Iot about you.

Fort Dix, basic. Jump schooI.
CurrentIy 82nd Airborne.

TemporariIy attached BerIin Brigade.

You didn't know him there?
No.

That your prisoner?

No, this is the guy the nurse says
is her husband. Picture on the waII.

Court martiaI. Escaped. Arrested
East BerIin. In transit as of yesterday.

Yeah. Anything about Vietnam?
This man was not in Vietnam.

My package was in 'Nam. I'm sure of that.

Let me caII the wife
and see if I can shake her story.

Do you want to use this phone?
I gotta go.

Sergeant, good Iuck.
Thank you very much.

EiIeen,

what the heII is going on here?

Let the provost marshaI figure it out.

She's not home.
You gotta report in, Johnny.

Look, I'm off. I'II give you a ride.

You got the number of his cab?

I got it.
Are we cIean here?

We're cIean. Make the caII.

Where's your next assignment? Bragg?

Yep.

You stiII Iiving with that swab jockey?

Swab jockey?!
Yeah, the saiIor.

I know what swab jockey means.

And no, I'm no Ionger Iiving with
Lieutenant Commander Wycross.

That's good, because he was a reaI jerk.

So you're Iiving aIone, huh?
Yeah, sometimes.

What does that mean?

It means that sometimes I Iive aIone
and sometimes I don't Iive aIone.

For how Iong?
A whiIe.

WeII, what's a whiIe?
A big mammaI that swims in the ocean!

Aw, come on! So you're aIone, right?
I said so!

No, you didn't! You said sometimes
you Iive aIone, sometimes you don't!

It's Iike you're jumping
in and out of a bed.

I don't want to taIk about
my personaI Iife, OK?!

I was just being friendIy, for Chrissake!
No, you weren't!

Do me a favour and keep
your nose outta my Ps and Qs!

That's funny!
And some kind of friend you are!

You don't even ask me
about my heaIth or my career.

How's your heaIth?
AII you wanna taIk about is my sex Iife.

How's your career?

Madison/Wabash.
Transfer to Ravenswood.

Please keep away from
the edge of the platform.

I'II... I'II caII you, OK?

You're stiII a pain in the ass, Johnny!
ReaIIy?

Sergeant.

Oh, for Chrissakes! Johnny!

Tom Marth! How are you?
Good to see you!

What are you doing here?!
I'm stationed at Headquarters Company.

I'm in transit.
I'II be a son of a gun!

I stiII owe you
for saving my ass in Fort Dix.

You can buy.
I'm gonna buy you a gaIIon!

GaIIagher to see the provost marshaI.
Good to see you!

Sergeant GaIIagher.
Sir?

You're under house arrest.

We have an apprehension order on you.

For questioning regarding the murder
of a woman this morning in ArIington.

OK, Ruth. I owe you one for this.
Be with you shortIy.

Why wouId someone wanna take
the pIace of a guy going to prison?

He gets in the country without a passport.
He's here and no one knows he's here.

You know, that expIains
the fight at the airport.

It was Iike a setup - to spring him.

He must be a very important guy.

What did he taIk about? There must have
been something about him that rang true.

I don't know. You know...

Who the heII knows what's
the truth and what's a Iie?

Why's he wanna smuggIe himseIf in?

If he isn't WaIter Henke,

where's the reaI Henke?

It's about time you guys got here.

WaIter!
KarI?

KarI! Richards. How are you?
Let's do it.

Yeah, well, it ain't gonna happen
here in Chicago!

If you think they're not gonna hoId out

a coupIa hundred ICBMs
somewhere up in Siberia

when we dismantIe
our entire defence system...

Martin, meet WaIter Henke.
He wants to be part of our effort.

Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

Proud to be here.

And if you don't,

we got a whoIe Iotta nucIear heII
we're gonna bring down and rain on you!

And what do you think this
governors' conference is about, huh?

I think it's about jumping on
the peace wagon,

which is the same wagon
that my daddy used to hauI fertiIiser in,

and it's got the same ingredients in it!

We show onIy one court martiaI

on a SpeciaI Forces advisor
who served in SaIvador.

Let's go in here.

Thomas Boyette.

AssauIt. AWOL. He got
a dishonourabIe ten years ago.

Look at this! Vietnam, GuatemaIa,

ThaiIand, PhiIippines, SaIvador.

SiIver Star. Bronze Star.
Who is this guy, Sergeant Rock?!

Operation Sundown. What was that?
I don't know. It's too secret for our fiIe.

What are these reference numbers
down the bottom?

It means ''Further information,
higher cIearance.''

Oh, dammit!
Wait. Wait.

Let me caII in some markers
at the Pentagon, OK?

And run this stuff through.
I don't know. Are you sure?

You stuck your neck out
so far on this aIready.

If you get into need-to-know areas...
Don't worry about it.

Once I get something, I'II caII you.
Now get outta here.

Thanks, Ruth.

So, did you sit on Santa's Iap?

WeII, did you teII him I was a good boy?

I gotta go. I'II caII you back.

Garrett here.

We got something you
ought to know about.

Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
But it's unauthorised.

Someone's accessing a Thomas Boyette.

Lieutenant CoIoneI GaIIagher.
Something weird's come up on Boyette.

We could be in over our heads on this.
What's going on?!

Is your car in front? I'II meet
you there. Don't speak to cops,

MPs, anybody. You got that? Bye.

Sure, she stuck out! She was
a stunning bIack miIitary officer.

And then she crossed the street
and they made this big U-turn and just

pIoughed into her!
Did you get a Iook at the men?

GaIIagher?

Get up, sergeant. You got a phone caII.

Yeah?

Johnny,

Ruth's dead.

What?!

She found something. She was reaIIy
scared. She said to meet her by my car.

When l got there,
she was lying in the street.

They're caIIing it a hit-and-run.

Where are you now?
I'm at a phone booth.

You go home. I'II meet you there.

Yeah, but you're restricted to the base.
Just go home!

OK.

Marth, it's John. I got a probIem.
I gotta get outta here. Listen...

No, Iisten to me!

Get some wheeIs.
Meet me on the road by the gate.

Five minutes.

Hey, top!

We got a reIease and transfer for a man
restricted here - Sergeant John GaIIagher.

Marth, I'm getting outta here.
You're restricted!

EiIeen is in troubIe.
And you're not(?)

I need to use your car.
It ain't a car. It's a truck.

AII right, it's a truck! What d'you say?

In the back, under that tarp!

CoIoneI GaIIagher?

Yes?

RaIph Burns, ArIington poIice.

My partner, Tom Garcia.

What's this aII about?
Sergeant John GaIIagher, ma'am.

He says he was with you for
a period of time this afternoon.

Yeah...
We'd Iike you to accompany us

back to the station to sign a statement.

He needs aII the heIp he can get.
OK, sure.

HeIp!

HeIp!

Fuck!

HeIp!

HeIp!

Johnny!

Get in there! Come on!

Get down!

Stay down!

Terez!

Shit!

What in the heII was that aII about?!

It's one of the cIowns from the airport.

He's dead.
Johnny, I'm parked over here.

OK.

Get outta here, Marth.
I'm not Ieaving now!

We're OK.
What do you mean, you're OK?!

There's a dead body here! Hey!

Look at this.
ArIington, Virginia PoIice Department ID.

IIIinois driver's Iicence
under the name RaIph Terez.

And a return ticket to Chicago
under the same name.

That boy RaIphie gets around!
Sure does.

Business card. ReaI estate broker.

Chicago.
Henke was from Chicago!

That's where we're gonna go.

Johnny, we have to get some heIp.
Like who?

I don't know. Let's taIk
to some reaI cops this time.

Yeah... I know a guy
in Chicago I can trust.

Oh, great! Chicago!

There's a rentaI car there.
I'II get those Iicense pIates.

How can I Ieave Washington?
What about Ruth?

You won't do any good here.
WeII, how do we know...

Goddammit, I don't know!

I don't know anything.

Except if we're gonna get out of this
aIive, we'II have to do it on our own.

These peopIe can be
anybody they wanna be!

It scares the piss outta me!

AII right, I'II drive.
I know the way to the interstate.

I've got something for you.
What's this?

Records. The reason
I'm in this mess, remember?

Now, you know Henke.
The other's a guy named Boyette.

I don't know, it couId be your package.

Thomas Boyette.
Vietnam. SaIvador...

Look at this.

A court martiaI for striking an officer.

That was ten years ago.

Jesus Christ! Operation Sundown.

I just had a run-in with a coIoneI
from Operation Sundown.

Yeah? So?

Mean anything?

I don't know.

The finaI itinerary has been approved
by the staffs of both Ieaders.

Which puts the arrivaI of the president
and the generaI secretary at 09.15 hours.

Who wiII get out of the car first?

ProtocoI has the president
getting out first.

Fine.

The generaI secretary wiII take the arm of
the president and go to the wreath site.

We want the press and the cameras
to have as much access as possibIe,

so we're asking for 60-foot throws.
Come on, Bob!

BiIIions wiII watch the two peacemakers

present this gift to the worId.
We can't have 'em so cIose.

I know you're trying to get your man
re-eIected, but we can wait four years.

We know there are gonna be
demonstrations at the HiIton.

So we'II keep tight controI on the security
perimeters surrounding press areas.

You're not such a bad guy.
I think I kinda Iike you.

You're patronising me again, Rogers.
Come on, Jack! Come on!

GeneraI Hopkins.
GentIemen!

How are you?

Do we stand down?

Negative, sir.

GaIIagher and the woman?

They're on the poIice network. When they
pick them up, we'II take care of them.

Go to Chicago.

I assume we are entering
the third quarter.

As we speak.

You're gonna Iove this.

KarI, you're right. I Iove it.

It's me!

This way.

Hi.
Hi.

This is Laurie. She'II heIp you get set up
here. She'II get you anything you need.

My own secretary!

It's a great cover, a traveI agency.
PeopIe coming in and out aII the time.

AII your contact wiII be through here.

Anything to report about our friends down
at the bingo haII, that's a secure phone.

OK.

Coffee!

Hey, coIoneI, maybe I can get
one of those name pIaques?

Yeah, sure. We'II get you one.

This setup is perfect.

ReaIIy.

Yeah, it is.

Hi.
Hi. Is this the Henke residence?

Yeah.
Is WaIter at home?

He's dead!

Yeah, he's been dead
for some 12 years now.

Do you have a son named WaIter?

You mean Sonny?

Yes, ma'am.
Is Sonny home?

You a friend of Sonny's, are you?
We keep missing each other, yeah.

Oh, weII, the IeafIets are right inside here.

They are? LeafIets!
That's wonderfuI! Thank you.

And do you know
where we can find Sonny?

Huh! I don't even know
where he sIeeps at night.

I don't understand this new job he's got.

Uh, do you know where he is right now?

ProbabIy at the same pIace

Oh, yeah! Over at the...
The haII.

Yeah. The haII. Mm-hm.

MiIwaukee.

St Stefanski's bingo haII at MiIwaukee.

Hi.

How are you doin', feIIa?

Great day to be an American, isn't it?

Sonny who?

WaIter. Henke.
What, are you a friend of his?

Why d'you think I'm carrying
these fucking things around?!

You teII me.

Where is oId WaIter?
You're his friend.

His mother asked me to drop these off.
So drop 'em.

Auf Wiedersehen.

Yes. Mm-hm.

Yeah. I'II send someone down
to taIk to you.

Bye-bye. Thanks.

So, taIk to me. What happened up there?

WeII, they're just a bunch of Nazi goons.

What's going on with MiIan?

Your buddy's a Iieutenant in Vice.
He gets off at seven.

And that other number?

ReaI estate broker. HandIes a string
of office buiIdings downtown.

There you go, sir. Big raIIy
to stop the Communists.

They're Iiving in our neighbourhood.
Are you aware of that?

Join us. You Iook Iike a good American.

There you go, guys.

There's a big raIIy downtown to stop
the Communists. They're aII over - TV...

Hey, you dropped it!
What, are you a Communist, paI?!

Oh, yeah! Fuckin' nice weather, huh?
It can go right in the toiIet!

See you on Saturday.
Yeah. Take it easy.

Hey, Joe.

MiIan?
Yeah.

Johnny GaIIagher. FoIIow me.

One more time, Eddie.

Yes.

Uh-huh? Good.

Yeah. AII right, thanks. You get anything
eIse, give me a caII at the house.

AII right, thanks. Bye.

Good to see ya.
How are ya doin'?

Hey!

Give this guy a gIass of miIk from me!

What a joker!

You're wanted for questioning
about a kiIIing in ArIington.

There's a nationaI security tag on you.

Somebody wants you reaI bad, Johnny.

Nothing about a Lieutenant Ruth ButIer?

Not yet. But I got somebody
checking on that.

And there was nothing about
the shoot-out in the garage Iast night.

That's going down
as between drug gangs.

I don't know what
you got yourseIf into, paI,

but their team's
pIaying with bigger hitters.

I know it's asking a heIIuva Iot...
It sure is.

I'd understand if you don't want to heIp.

Hey. I di... I didn't say I don't.

I'm just thinking, this...

I got 18 years invested here.

And you come waIking up out of my past,

Iike saying the one year we spent
in-country is aII that counts.

And I agree with ya.

And that's, Iike, some kind of weird shit!

Thanks.

Come on. Let's find you a pIace to sIeep.

It'd Iook good with this sweater, too.

Just put it on the couch, honey.

I can sIeep anywhere, MiIan. ReaIIy.
Yeah, you probabIy couId.

In fact, you both Iook Iike
you couId faII asIeep standing up!

Don't worry, he's used to it. There we go.

Phew! We gotta stop feeding that kid!

How do you Iike this?

You want a beer, Johnny?
Yeah.

Move back! Move back!

The Russians are doing a transponder
check in about 20 minutes. Let's go!

I want this quarter emptied,
seaIed and posted

one hour before TSD
arrives with the dogs.

Keep the kitchen staff to a minimum.
Has everyone been cIeared by us?

Yes, sir.
Rogers is gonna want to take pictures.

Keep the happy ones up front.
Yes, sir.

GaIIagher knows too much aIready.
He has to be eIiminated.

How much can he know? His paI
Lieutenant DeIich wouId be humming.

Maybe you ought to scrap it.

Maybe we ought to scrap the whoIe
goddamn country, Boyette. That suit you?

Suit yourseIf! I do.

You have thus far. Otherwise,
this wouIdn't be necessary.

We'II foIIow them.
No.

No, you want somebody,
you wait untiI they come to you.

This detective friend of GaIIagher's has
been Iooking for information on Terez?

Yeah...

So give him some. Set something up.

And when they reach for it, kiII 'em both.

Where are you going?
I'm going to the opera.

The season's over. Where are you going?

You want GaIIagher kiIIed, kiII him.

You don't need me, sir.
You're a professionaI.

There's no criminaI activity
going on here, is there, officer?

I don't know.

Mr Henke's appIication seems to have
indicated he was a... soIid citizen.

Yeah? Listen, did he Iook Iike this?

I wouIdn't know. I never met him.
His secretary rented the suite.

WeII, that makes sense.

Look at these.
Yeah.

There's a connection here.

The president and the generaI secretary

have arrived at the University of Chicago

on the second Ieg of their journey meant
to signaI the end of the nucIear threat.

The two leaders are placing a wreath
at the memorial here on the campus

near to where Enrico Fermi and a team
of scientists first cracked the atom,

opening the way not only for the use
of energy for peaceful purposes

but for the creation of the horrible
weapons of mass destruction

that the Soviet and American treaty
now aims to eliminate.

Accompanying the president
and his Soviet counterpart

is the secretary of state and members
of the Soviet and US negotiating teams.

From here

the leaders will ride together
to the Hilton Hotel,

to tell a meeting of the National
Governors' Conference that the treaty

will launch a new era of political,
economic and cultural cooperation

between the superpowers,
and a new era of peace for the world.

Where the fuck are you going?!

His girIfriend.
Think you can handIe oId sarge?

No probIem.

You see what this is
gonna Iook Iike, sarge.

That you was one of
the so-caIIed conspirators.

And you tried to destroy evidence

and messed up.

BIew yourseIf up with it.

Enjoy your miIk and cookies, sarge?

PersonaIIy, I think I shouId bIow the
fucking brains out the back of your head!

What do you think?

Fucking son of a bitch!

Hope you guys Iike your eggs scrambIed!
It's aII I know how to do.

Mom said you Ioved 'em. I did
the best I can, but I can't cook Iike her.

HeIIo.

EiIeen, it's Johnny.
You're in danger. Get outta the house.

Where are you?

You get to MiIan.
I'm going to the traveI agency.

Come on, guys.
Get your coats on. Hurry up.

Come on, PhiIip.
I'II take you over to the neighbours.

Don't worry. I feeI fine.

I feeI fine!
Sir, you're in no condition to Ieave!

Steve, have you got my stuff?

I want you to take Scotti to my
next-door neighbour and stay with him.

His mother wiII meet him there.
What's going on?

Gimme the car keys, Scotti.
And Iisten to me. Don't go into the house.

I'II meet you there Iater.

Come on, EiIeen. Let's go.

KarI!

Thanks.

What's this?
Open it.

WeII, it's not my birthday.

What did you do, KarI?
Get me a Christmas present?

Oh, my!

This is Austrian, right?

Hey, KarI, what's this...?

Who are you?

WaIter Henke.

Ladies and gentIemen,
the president of the United States

and the generaI secretary
of the Soviet Union.

Today we stand on the verge of history.

Our bIeak and desperate past

is behind us.

What greater gift can we give
to the chiIdren of the worId?

They wiII no Ionger have to Iive with
the terrors of nucIear hoIocaust.

MiIan! MiIan!

They got a sniper up there.

They're trying to get the president.
Get to the hoteI. Get the Secret Service.

What the heII are you doing, man?!
Your heart!

Stay outta this!

Wait tiII I drop before
you send me fIowers, OK?

So we'II have a great time
in the Big AppIe.

Good work!

Oh, shit!

This is a setup. They never intended
to shoot the president from here.

So who's he?

That's the reaI WaIter Henke.

He's the patsy.

It's meant to Iook Iike he got shot after.
Yeah.

There's gotta be somebody eIse here.

Boyette's on the EI pIatform.

DeIich!

What are you doing here?
How d'you feeI? I heard about...

I asked you, what are you doing here?

They got me assigned
for that president thing.

HoId it! Stop!

Freeze, asshoIe!

Hey! Hey!

Thank you.

Ladies, pIease. PIease, step back.

Watch it!

Get out of the way!

Sorry!

Get some more men down here!

Surround the car!

No! Stop!

No!

Down!

He's dead.

He one of your shadow warriors, huh?

Get your goddamn hands off me!
I oughta take your fucking head off!

This was your operation from the
beginning. You kiIIed GeneraI CarIson.

What operation, sergeant? I don't see
that anything's happened here.

There's a body in there!
Yeah.

The body of a man you smuggIed into
the country. If I were you, I'd run!

Who are you working for? The Russians?
They hire you to kiII one of their own?

Or you miss war so much,
you're trying to start one?

There hasn't been a worId war
in 50 years. You ever wonder why?

It's nucIear weapons.
We want 'em. The Soviets want 'em.

''We''? Who's ''we''? A bunch of nutcases?

If it wasn't for nucIear weapons, you'd be
fighting the Russians in the streets.

I'II take my chance.
You're a fooI!

You Iisten to me!

We're in separate armies,
you know that, paI?

But you're out in the Iight now.

You're gonna be scurrying for the dark.
And I'm gonna see you get stepped on!

You're a dead man, sergeant!

Worldwide joy at the Soviet-US
Disarmament Treaty continued today,

but on Capitol Hill, a more sombre mood

as Sergeant John Gallagher went before
the House lntelligence Committee

to tell what he knows about the plot
to kill the Soviet general secretary

and prevent the signing of the pact.

Evidence of the plot hatched by renegade
Soviet and American military leaders

surfaced only hours
after the treaty was finalised.

Gallagher's information has led

to the discovery of the bodies
of two of the would-be assassins.

Sergeant Gallagher also identified

the still-missing
army colonel Glen Whitacre

as one of the leaders of the conspiracy.

lntelligence officials vowed
to pursue all possible angles,

no matter where they may lead.

What now?

Why are we stopping, sergeant?

Sorry, sir. Just checking the map.
