What you want, when you want.

When you want.
KMBZ to its disposition.

The voice of Kansas City,
in the news.

Sandra Day O'Connor,
the first woman whom she integrated…

… the Supreme Court it presented/displayed
its letter of resignation…

… ending to him its race
in this court.

Let us go to the White House.

Good day.

I have ordered my people
that it compiles information…

… and it recommends, from our optics,
to potential candidates…

… that they interpret faithfully…

… the Constitution and the laws
of our country.

And I create,
that like Christian citizens…

… of this country, we must
to involve to us actively…

… at this moment historical.

GOD BLESSES TO THE U.S.A.

And if in this country, the Church…

… the believers, are united
and they adopt a position…

… I believe that it would produce
a powerful one, powerful impact…

… in this process.

We do not have to fall asleep
at this moment decisive…

… because frankly, the generations
successors depend on us.

Let us say right now so that
the perfect will of God is fulfilled.

Today we are surrounded…

… in which they call
war of the cultures.

We did not initiate…

… but, by grace of God,
we will put aim to him.

And we must say: “Yes…

… we want to recover America
for Christ ".

From the pulpito,
this malintencionado message…

… “we against them”, it is what…

… the right religion
it is doing…

… now in the United States,
it is dividing the country.

Well, we are with Tyry…
Yes.

… in Hillside, Illinois,
that it listens to the WCPT.

What you must to say to us?

I am Christian, I am a Christian
that it believes in the Bible.

Of some way, these types
they do not go with the Christianity…

… nor with which I have learned.

That is to say, there is authoritarianism
in them and…

… there is nothing no gentile,
nor merciful…

… for me, they are not nothing Christian,
that is…

Yes. It is… It is…
It is the other way around.

I mean…
Yes, I am… I always…

… I have been Christian, and I create
that it is probably the thing…

… that angers to me more
of which it is happening.

Nothing of… Yes, nothing of this
it really has sense for me.

Then there is a new type
of religion there outside…

… somehow
the things have changed…

… since Mateo…
uh, wrote… uh…

… it wrote on the sermon
of Jesus in the mount…

… where Jesus said to us
that we are pacificadores.

And now they…
Everything what they do…

… and they say they do it and they say
in name of God.

That we must go
to the war in name of God.

They are saying to us
that George Bush, like no other…

… he is a man santo
that it has been anointed…

… with the task of… of…
to create a Christian society…

… not only in the U.S.A.,
but anywhere in the world.

You know… We know…
You and I know that it is a mistake.

East tangle of policy exists
with religion.

What… what lesson class
she is that for our children?

THE CAMPING DE JESUS

It has never had
a generation like this.

The Earth is filled
of died and dying…

… in body and spirit.

But now it is the moment
so that the glory…

… with the Gentleman the Earth covers
as the water covers the sea.

Now it is the moment.

We prophesied these dry bones.

Elevemonos.
Now it is the moment.

Hablemos the word of the Gentleman!

It did not know how much people would come today here.

CONFERENCE OF INFANTILE ORATION
LEE'S SUMMIT, MISSOURI

They said that the audience to me
it had capacity for 500…

… we are making it enough good,
truth?

Very well, they listen, mothers and papas.

I want to tell some them of the things…

… that we have in the bookstore.

We have the Evangelical School…

… that lamentably,
so much is not sold…

… because people, by some reason…

… they create… seems to me
that they think that is…

… a manual of preaches at home.

And it is not thus.
There is a manual practitioner in the end…

… that teaches to them
to the boys how, eh…

… to initiate a conversation
with its friends…

… and to direct to the lost one.

Another thing that it wanted to announce to them…

… it is that our camping
it will be in August.

Yes.

And that we are going it to happen very well.

There are pamphlets…

… on the camping
waiting for them in the bookstore.

Single they need to choose one
and to begin to pray…

… on if they can arrive
or not there this year.

In agreement? Small and small!

All good seated,
the together hands…

… the smiling faces
watching towards here.

Hay somebody creates here…

… that God can make any thing?

God can do something!
Let us say: “ God, fixes the world”.

How many of you you know
that this it is an old and ill world?

This it is an old and ill world.

Then, we are going to fix it!

That somebody serve its tools…

… and we fix this old world!

Boys, we must change the things.

We have too many Christian adults…

… fat and sluggish.

They do not want to resign to its supper…

… they do not want to ayunar during 3 days…

… or 40 days or what is.

Saben that the Muslims
they train his children…

… from the 5 years of age…

… to ayunar during the month of the Ramadan?

Listen, we have the keys.

We can change the world.

The boys can change the world?

By all means.

By all means!

Pongamonos standing up.
# Aleluya #

I need are taken in serious,
that they take in serious God.

They say: “God…”
God…

“I am here for training to me”.

I am here for training to me.

“I am here for educating to me. ”

I am here for educating to me.

“I am arranged, God. ”
I am arranged, God.

“I will do what you want that does. ”

I will do what you want that does.

“I will say what you want that it says. ”

I will say what you want that it says.

“In the name of Jesus…”
In the name of Jesus…

“Amen”.
Amen.

If they do not open its mouths…

… the Spirit Santo will not speak.

, I want that all very well
raise its hands…

… and we will say in other languages.

Aleluya, we do it.

Oh, we loved to you, Jesus.

Sir.

Spirit Santo, sees.
Spirit Santo!

Feel its power.
Feel its power.

Let us speak a new language.

The Spirit Santo whispers to us
to the ear what to say.

Does not stop! Does not stop!

This it is the hugest day
of its lives…

… the day of your salvation.

It is not in critical moment,
it is not outside control…

… he is very conscious of which it happens.

It is connected the spirit…

… single it is concentrated.

Becky Fischer
he is infantile pentecostal minister.

It organizes conferences and a camping
of annual summer for evangelistas children.

I go to playgrounds
where there are children…

… that does not know anything
on the Christianity…

… I guide them towards the Gentleman
in a matter of…

… very just a short time,
and… and at few moments…

… they are having visions
and listening to the voice of God…

… because they are open.

They are very usable in the Christianity.

If we considered
the population of the world…

… one third part
of 6,700 million people…

… they are young minors of 15 years,
the third part.

Where we must put
our efforts?

In what we would have to be concentrated?

I will say to you in what they are concentrated
our enemies…

… in the children.

They penetrate in the schools.
Veto to Palestine…

… and I can show to you
some Web sites…

… that would shake completely
your foundations…

… and I can show to you
photos of where they take…

… to its children, like us
we took them campings to Biblical…

… they put grenades to them in the hands…

… they teach to them to put themselves
belt-pump…

… they teach to them to use guns…

… they teach to them to use machine guns…

… it is not to be strange,
that with that type of…

… intensive training
and disciplined…

… those young people are
arranged to commit suicide…

… by the cause of the Islam.

I want to see young people
so it jeopardize with the cause…

… of Jesus Christ

like those young people
they are with the Islam.

I want to see give them
its lives of a radical way…

… to the Gospel like…
since they do it in Pakistan…

… in Israel and… and Palestine…

… and in so many other places,
because we have…

… disculpame,
but we have the truth!

I would say that there is surroundings
more cosy now…

… in the United States
towards the Christianity…

… del that has had in all my life…

… and it has to do much,
in recent years…

… it has to do with president Bush.

It has brought true credibility…

… to the Christian faith.
It very has been opened…

… obviously open,
on its faith in God.

Today, exactly now,
a prophecy is being fulfilled.

We must raise to us
and to recover the nation.

Listen,
single it wanted to know them better.

You came with Mark, truth?
Yes.

And he are its shepherd?
But is not relatives of him?

Truth?
No

It will not come
to our east camping summer.

You also come?

To Dakota of the North?
To Dakota of the North.

Yes.
Vienen? Brilliant.

Viene all the family
or single you, small?

I believe that single we.
Wonderful!

With my brother, my twin brother.

I want to know more on you.

How much does that they are Christian?

I became Christian, when she had…

-… to the 5 years they saved to me.
Yes?

Because I tried more of the life.

Yes?
And there was nothing…

… that outside amused…

To the 5 years you thought
that there was nothing no amused?

Yes. To the 5 years.
In serious? Oh, in serious?

How you think that it will be
this camping?

What delays?

What hope that God does by you?

What I hope that God does by me?

Yes, in the camping?
I think… Oh, in the camping!

In the camping,
I believe that God goes to me to, you you know…

… to be used to to me knowing another people…

… because I have difficulties for that.

I do not create it.
I am timid.

You are timid? I cannot believe it.

Except with the things
that they pass in the Spirit Santo.

Yes, in that you are not for anything timid.

No
Oh, you are brilliant.

Esteem much that has come.
It is well.

I am glad to return to see them in summer.

Dame a hug. Very well.

Enchanted of conocerte, Terrene.
Enchanted of conocerte, Levi.

We were already spoken.
Very well.

Very well, good bye, good bye.

The evangelistas create
that to be saved…

… they must “return to be born”
accepting to Jesus like its rescuer.

A 43% of the evangelistas Christians
“they return to be born” before the 13 years.

Encontremonos in my house Sunday
before the party. - God

Moment of creation, garden of the Eden…

… it does about 6000 years approximately.

Was a this explosion?

Venimos from pegote viscous?

Argh! Argh!

I do not create it.

One says that we are
the result of an explosion…

… is this truth? Is scientist?

Or is based single on a belief?

Levi, sees here.

I need that you approach.

It is well, we review some things.

To analyze the creation
with physical sciences

Something frequents that they do
the American politicians…

… it is to remarcar that the summers
in the United States…

… they are hotter
in the last years.

Like result,
the climatic change must be real.

What there is of erroneous
in this reasoning?

That single increased 0.6 degrees.
Ah.

Yes, it is not really
a great problem, no?

No. I do not believe that that
get to harm to us.

It is… It is a great political subject,
the climatic change.

And that is what really
you must…

-… to understand…
The evolution also?

Um, not much. At the most…
The creacionismo?

Um, is becoming now.

What happens if you go to a school
where the teacher says…

… that the creacionismo is stupid…

… and you are stupid if you believe in that?

I believe that they must… Yes.
Well?

Or, what happens if you go to a school…

… where the teacher says
that the evolution is stupid…

… and you are a stupid one
if you believe in that?

It would not matter to me.
It would not matter to you.

If sights the creacionismo…

… it give account you of which it is
the only possible answer…

-… to all the questions.
He is right what papa says.

It is the only answer
possible to all the questions.

Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.

Yes.

Entendiste the part where it says that…

… science nontest nothing? Ja!

And he is very interesting
when it sights of that form.

It is It.
It is It.

Very well!
Very well.

I personally believe that Galileo
he made the correct decision…

… when leaving science by Christ.

75% of the children educated in house
in EE.UU they are Christian evangelical.

God did not say that it had children…

… and one occurred them person to another
during 8 hours to the day.

And if I can teach to them in house…

… as well as it does
the state school…

… so that to send them to another part
8 hours to the day?

Our nation was founded…

… on judeocristianos values.

We know that when the things
they began to change…

… it was let pray in the schools, and…

… ah… the schools
they began to come down.

And now we say:

“Delay a minute,
where it is my country “.

Let us create firmly that…

… there are two types of people
in the world.

Those that they love Jesus and those that no.

And I want that my children grow
saying: “ Sabes what?

“To be Christian he is something good”.

… Matthew Spalding, our guest.

Tomorrow, Glenn Thomas
he will give a direct testimony us…

… of marines
involved Christians…

… in the Operation Freedom for Iraq…

… of its book God Saw Them Through.

Tomorrow he will be very interesting…

… we will see ourselves again here.

… # in center #

So that they teach to the children
that the global heating does not exist?

It is well, so that?
Watch, mistreat this world…

… they violate this earth,
take everything what they want of her…

… because, knows what?
It does not have importance.

We will not be long time here.

Christ will come stops
to take to us of the Earth…

… so they cut the trees,
use all petroleum…

… and they take advantage of everything
what the Earth offers to us.

For that reason one listens to them become jumbled…

… in subjects like
the global heating.

And… and… and… you want to shake them.

And to say to them: “ What… what…

… what is what you do not understand…

… of the foundations of the Christianity?

… By…? How you arrived here “.

Our president continues saying to him
to the Americans…

… that we must teach
creacionismo in the schools.

That we must teach it
at he himself level that the evolution.

I believe that we have become
very complacientes in this…

… and I believe that they are obtaining…

… exactly what they want.

Sabes what it is happening in Kansas?

Yes, I know it. I saw.

They must teach intelligent design…

… on a par of the evolution of Darwin.

Good, we think about that.

It is being lain to 600,000 children.

There is no conflict between both things.

Good, not…
That is religion…

… it is not science.

We have a population,
25% of the population of the U.S.A.…

… now, it is described itself
like evangelista.

Eh… this is near…
80 million people.

They are very perseverantes
and they lay way…

… until positions of being able in the U.S.A.

That is modus operandi
of… of… of a group…

… that…
it jeopardizes, as I say…

… to construct a government
with which they feel comfortable.

In the end it will be like a thief
at night.

They are crushing slowly…

… the separation between the Church
and the State.

“Jesus died, was buried…

… and three days later,
It rose of between deads.

… was not single Jesus a man?
No, Jesus Christ…

… it is All-powerful God ".

Rachael?
Rachael?

Rachael, is your turn.
I know It.

Ahead, Rachael.
We go, Rach, you do a plenary session.

Yes, yes.
Haz a plenary session this time!

Jesus Christ…

… your spirit will help me…

… to that this it is a good shot.

Ball, I order to you in name of Jesus…

… that leaves a good shot to me.

Is well, Rachael!

Of this side, strips.
It is well.

It follows thus. It continues making that curve.

It tries to begin a little more down.

Hello.
Hello.

God finishes saying to me that He…
that you are in his mind…

… and that wants llevarte
and that It wants…

… amarte, and that has plans
special for your life…

… and that It wants…

… that you can follow it
yet your heart.

Mm, thanks.
Don't mention it.

Thanks.
Don't mention it.

You made plenary sessions?

Guau! It dresses her
and right you felt that…

… God said to you that you were.

Yes, I waited for a little,
you know, to be safe…

-… you understand what I say?
You felt It in your heart?

Aha. And later I felt
that it had chosen the indicated person.

Very well. Good work, Rachael.

It tries to be obedient.

I am like a priest of bowling.
Taking that.

When it grows, single I…

… I always thought
that he would be amused to be…

… of those people
that they paint the nails and others…

Rachael
9 years

… because it could have the opportunity
to speak to them on the Gentleman.

That is, calm,
Christian music of bottom…

… already you know, doing it,
you understand what I say?

He would be very relajante…

… and in certain way…

… they would not have so many, so many
walls then, you know…

… and they could accept it, you know?

Several times have made fun of of me…

… and… and I have said myself to same me:

“ The decision of a man? He is not nothing.

The decision of God, is something ".

Creen that I am rare? It is well.

You are not the one who will judge…

… if I must go to the sky or hell.
God will be it.

The important thing is what
He thinks of me…

… It… does not matter what you think.

JESUS WILL COME SOON! THE SIN
IT BRINGS DEATH, GOD BRINGS ETERNAL LIFE.

This is my favorite part.

Guau!

My type of favorite music is like…

… heavy metal,
a rock and roll Christian.

It is centered in its bases…
aiming towards Jesus…

… e, even, some
of the subjects they do not say…

… “Jesus” or “our Gentleman”
or… things thus…

… but they have a Christian base…

… and they are focused towards Him,
and for that reason I like.

Um, and… but as much Britney Spears
like Lindsay Lohan…

… and another people of the sort…

… definitively they do not matter to me…

… because all its songs
they are based mainly…

… or in boys or girls…

… and, um… we,
like Christians, not…

… good, I do not believe in that.

Victory?
Yes?

You must finish in 5 minutes…

-… because you must have lunch.
Yes.

When I dance I must
to assure to me that there it is God…

… because people will realize…

… when single I dance with the body.

And sometimes I do it, I admit it…

MY PAPA IS IN THE ARMY

… and really I need to surpass it.

I am not…
I am not the unique one that does…

People… You are not the unique one…

… that commits that error.

I have to Jesus in the heart

That you want a galletita?
It takes a galletita.

Very well. It is well.

First we say the oration
of loyalty…

… now that we are all…
before continuing.

Jenny? Christian?
Could be stopped, please?

It is well.
It is well.

I promise loyalty
to the Christian fight…

… to El Salvador whose kingdom stays.

Our brotherhood unites to the Christians
in unit and love.

It is well, we touched the Bible.

Right of perpetual ownership loyalty to the Bible…

… to the sagrada word of God.

It will be a lamp for my feet…

… and a light for my way.

I will hide its words in my heart…

… so that it cannot sin
against God.

Very well, all.

I see it I took root, and George also…

… our children
they are a loan of God to us…

… and someday we go
to have to respond before God…

… by the form in which we raised them.

I say: “Sir,
you have given this daughter me…

… and, how one assumes
that I must train it?

What assumes that I must do now “

I bring it to places
where it can learn it…

… of Becky, the Shepherd Carol,
of different people.

But the Gentleman said to me
that what I must train…

… it is its character.

Where you go?

I am going away to stop under rain.

It is well.

Very well, already you stopped yourself under rain.

I still did not get wet.
Well, I do not want…

… that you are soaked.

Victory, dates return
and it enters right now. Thanks.

8, 9, 10. They had to me to fall
10 drops of rain…

-… because I am 10 years old.
You are very graceful.

Guau, we go.

Tori?

Well, we are going to empacar your things, we go.

I do not know how, but we are preparing ourselves
for the camping.

Tori, we must take
stock-market to sleep…

… the Bible, a pen
and a notebook.

The lantern, oh…

The things for the dance
of “they breathe prophesy”.

Yes!

It is well, you found the mesh?

It looks for in your… Yes, it looks for there.

In 2001, the shepherd Becky Fischer
she inaugurated the summer camping…

… “Young to red the alive one” in Devil's Lake,
Dakota of the North.

They attend evangelistas families
of all the country.

We are going to walk in…
between the banks and others…

… and… we will say for the chairs. Yes.

Yes, in the name of Jesus, we prayed by…

… each person who feels
in these chairs during this week…

… and we… Sir, we requested to you…

… that covers the blood to us with Jesus…

… that you open the hearts, Sir,
that you open the hearts.

Father, we prayed by
the electrical system…

… we requested to you that the light
it is not cut in this building…

… in name of Jesus…

… it is by storms
or for some other reason.

Now I am going to request by this equipment…

… by the presentations
in PowerPoint…

… the video projectors…

… and we say: “Demon,
we know what you like to do…

… in meetings like this ".

And we say:
“You will not do it in name of Jesus.

You will not avoid
that this message is transmitted…

… there will be no problems with the microphone
in name of Jesus ".

We say that, in name of Jesus.

Father, we asked to you you,
All-powerful Jesus…

… that this is a little while
decisive in its lives.

Father, I request that Jesus
be glorified in this camping.

You cannot enter there.

Billy, you cannot go there.

It is well. I am so…

This exhausts to me.

Demonos a great one, great applause.

Is well?
Good night.

Vinieron!

What seems to them my hairdo?

And the nails?

The eyebrows?

And what reduces of me.

This week we will speak
of how the devil…

… it uses tactics to destroy
our lives.

The first tactics that use…

… he is tentarte to the sin.

Mainly when he is young…

… because it is indeed
when all these things begin.

When one is young,
the sin does not seem to be…

… something very important.

It seems something attractive, in fact
something likeable, fleecy.

But the sin is planned
for destruirte.

And you feed that baby
during long time…

… and it is growing in your life…

… until you see yourself in hardships…

… and you do not know how arreglartelas…

… and what it seemed to them very innocent…

… now it controls its lives.

The devil goes in search of the young people.

Of that they cannot
to fix them to it single.

For that reason we want to help them…

… we want to warn to them.

And speaking of that…

… I will say to something on Harry Potter to them.

The wizards are enemy of God!

And it does not matter to me what type of heroes is.

They are enemy of God…

… and if there were been
in the Old Testament…

… Potter would have occurred to death to Harry.

Amen!

The wizards are not heroes.

This is a generation
that it will be raised by the purity…

… the rectitud and the sanctity…

… and that will serve the Gentleman
every day of its life.

And we declared
all those things on you.

I believe that I have dedicated all my life…

… to assure to me
of which you obtain it.

Tonight I feel in my heart
what the Gentleman says…

… that are some boys here…

… that claims to be Christian…

… that always goes to the church…

… but that is a thing
when they go to the church…

… and another thing…

… when they are in the school
with its friends…

… they are false and hypocritical.

They make things that would not have to do…

… they are malhablados
just as other boys.

It is the hour to clean its acts.

Come here and you are washed.

Because we cannot have hypocrites
in the army of God.

If that you are, pon the hands here.

Oh, boy, wash your hands.

Father, we finished washing itself
with the water of your word.

We will not say nothing else, Demon.
Nothing else.

Say, boys and girls,
in the name of Jesus.

They know exactly
what they must regret.

Says it! Say it aloud.

Say it,
what they need to be pardoned?

# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

Not more stupidities,
not more hipocresia.

Now you arrived at a place and you say…

… and you begin to feel
repentance here.

# Oh- oh… Oh- oh #

Uh… I… uh…
I do not have much to say.

Single I… wanted
to speak on the belief in God…

… and I have been a long time
doing this and…

… it is quite difficult to do this…

… exactly to believe in God
it is quite difficult…

… because we do not see it,
not… not…

… one does not know much of Him.

Sometimes not even I create
what it is written in the Bible.

It seems to me a lie,
and I feel like culprit…

… and badly because… God always
it has spoken to me on that…

… of how I have rejected it.

Bu!

It is one pretty small house.

Ahhh!

Ah…

Somebody died.
Ah… what fear.

In the dark, dark house
there was the dark, dark corridor.

The dark, dark corridor
it took to the dark, dark quarter.

In the dark, dark quarter
there was the dark, dark stairs.

Ay.

Is all laid down?
I no.

It is well.
I will not do it…

I will not make that history
of ghosts, in agreement?

Some very are amused,
but they do not award honor to God…

… and, uh, already you know,
God says that you concentrate yourself…

… in those things that are…
that they are true…

… and in those things that have beauty.

That you concentrate yourself in the good things
and the things of God, in agreement?

Here we go.
Lights extinguished, boys.

To what time is it the breakfast?
To eight.

I have the hair still wet.

God created the humans…

… that ate of
Tree of the Knowledge.

The good and badly
sin and death were in.

I have something drips blood
here in some place.

There, this is better.

And now I move these letters.

Thus it is better.

This generation in individual…

… it is the generation
of the Vista and the sound…

… and for that reason it is to them very difficult…

… to seat with a book,
a tablet and a pencil…

… and to try to learn of the form
that we have learned.

They learn visually,
by demonstration…

… they learn it…
modeling and all that.

Then, they are ours here
Adam and Eva, is not brilliant?

And like with the dolls
of Ken and Barbie of before…

… we taught to them how
they walked and they spoke…

… in the garden of the Eden with God…

… but when God
it insufflated his breath in the man…

… in its orifices,
the breath of the life…

Then the man
one becomes a living soul.

Now I say to them to the children…

… that if they want to become
in stronger Christians…

… and to have a human spirit
more fort…

… they must make certain things.

If they say to newspaper…

… his spirit will fortify itself.

If they go to the church
and they learn more about God…

… his spirit will fortify itself.

If you do not read the Bible…

We go, will be debilitated.

Ah, a failed globe.

Your spirit will be debilitated.

Then…

For example,
we have a brain mold…

… because one of the sessions
it is going to be…

… to speak on our minds…

… and how they need to nourish itself
of the word of God.

It is amused, because
you can make a mold of gelatin…

… that seems a brain.

And when we say how the things
they stick to our brains…

… and we used these sticky fingers…

… then this will represent
the dirty things…

… this could represent
to oath promises…

… this to things
that we have seen in tele…

… or what outside that we listened,
and one sticks to our minds…

… and soon we must strike them.

In the brain?
Yes.

I do not know if it is a blow…
if one is going away to beat very well…

… but, one is sticking there.

This sticks to the brain
and he is very effective for the children.

That is to say, we have many
different things.

What I do is to give a return…

… by jugueterias…

… and I see something and I think:

“This could be used for… ”.
Then…

… I enter with 20 classes of objects
and prayer by one hour…

… you know, and people…
Other ministers of children say:

“ Rezar during one hour to the children”.

And they feel pity by the children.

It does not have so that
to feel pity by my children.

They know very well, you know…

… they know that are obtaining it,
they are obtaining it.

# I have Jesus, and you?
I have Jesus, and you? #

# I have Jesus, yes,

# I have Jesus, I yes,
I have Jesus, and you? #

# I have Jesus, yes,

We are going to say again.

Very well! God, we are thankful to you
the food this morning.

We requested to you, Father, who you bless it…

… and suplicamos Mr. Jesus, you
your blood on our sins…

… and the sins of our nation.

God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again.

Thanks, Jesus, amen.

Mother, is not looked like Harry Potter?

Mother, he looks itself like Harry Potter.

A little, yes.
Delay a little while.

I cannot see it, because it has witchcrafts.

Yes… My mother does not want that she sees
none of the films…

… for that reason of the witchcraft,
but I see them in the one of my papa.

Becky Fischer.

Becky Fischer,
live and in colors?

It watches my new hairdo.

It will be the cover of number one…

… of Children's Ministry,
that it will leave in April.

It is almost like being
in the cover of Rolling Stones.

There we are.

Until now, the camping
he has been wonderful.

I adore to be in the presence of God.

God is not in all the churches,
that is to say, that…

There are some… There are certain churches…

… the calls dead churches…

… where people feel.

# We venerated to You, God,
we venerated to you, God #

They sing three songs
and soon they listen to a sermon.

The churches to which God wants
that we go they are those where…

… people jump, shouts her name…

… and they say Him to him.
They are not acting…

… they are not quiet…
# To You we venerated #

They are… Aleluya! God!
You already know, and…

… and depending on how…
they invite It…

… it goes to be there or no.

V I c t Or r I To,
this it is the troyano shout military.

V I c t Or r I To,
this it is the troyano shout military.

I have my Bible.

They said to me that it went
to read a sermon tonight.

It enchants to me to read sermons to them to the children.

I have never preached
in front of a group of children…

… that I do not know.

I feel, that is to say, I feel…

… I feel that we are
a key generation, in serious.

I feel that…

that this generation
it is a key generation…

… so that Jesus returns.

This is exactly what I mean.

I do not write the sermon,
God writes the sermon.

I mean, that I feel
sometimes when I am writing…

… I feel it in my arm…

… somebody maintains my arm
when I am writing, truth?

And I feel when I go there
and I begin to preach…

… that the Spirit Santo
he is going to leave me.

And… it is not that it puts to me
to me to preach there…

… but that she is as if not outside I.

We cannot remain
seated all the day…

… because Satan will come to look for to us.

It is not seated either.

If Satan is not seated
you would not have quedarte seated.

Satan will deal with sacarte of your way…

… of your race, your course…

You do not leave does that.

In the name of Jesus,
you do not leave Satan removes to you…

… of the way that God
it has reserved to you.

We are a generation
that it needs to revolt…

… that needs to revolt
and advertirte on the time…

… advertirte with our heart,
yet what we have.

Yes!

Now, who is prepared
in order to amuse itself tonight?

You will not be the same person…

… after this camping…

… you will be a different person…

… you will be radical, you will be to red the alive one.

How many of you you want
to be of that they give…

… its lives by Jesus?

I have my old and sacred one
ghost hammer tonight.

We are going to break some things
in the heights tonight.

We are going to break the power
of the enemy in the government.

They enter your schools and…

… they remove to Jesus from your school…

… but there is something cannot do…

… and it is to remove to Jesus from your heart.

We cannot remain seated
and to accept a corrupt government.

I believe that God wants to put…

… pious and right people in the government.

How many of you
they want to break this glass?

The one of the power of the enemy
in the government.

To break this glass.

Break this thing
in name of Jesus.

The glass of the government just
by a government just.

Sir, sees protect
that government just.

Whenever you break a glass…

… there is a liberation in the spirit.

We break the power of the devil
in this nation.

In name of Jesus, one has gone away.

Strong Griten, shouts strong!
Quiero oirlos!

… we break its bottom.

Fire in the world! In the world!

Jesus!

Tighten, boys, you tighten.

One does not treat like in McDonald's
of how fast raisins…

… by the car service.

If you want something of God…

… you are going to have to cook a little.

You need to leave it in the pot…

… to cook it to untimed fire
in the sacred ghost.

God touched to you tonight,
I want to hear that.

Somebody wine to say to me what happened.

It says, Tori.
It says.

It takes the microphone…

Sir, prayer stops
that he changes our nation…

… and we break the bows
that they have put to us…

… and… and we
we proclaimed to Leon de Judas.

It takes these prophecies…

… and you do what the apostle Pablo
it said, hazles the war.

This means war!

This means war!
This means war!

You are part of that or no?

Excuse, I like to throw stones.
It is well, Levi.

It is well, Levi.

When I know
to somebody nonChristian…

… you know, I always…

… there is always something…

… that does not seem to me correct…

… or there is always something
that… it produces fear to me…

… a disgust sensation, already you know.

In this world, all that
that they give you is sweepings.

It is like darte caramels…

… but I do not want caramels,
I want food.

The Spirit Santo is the food.

A good food, one knows the food
that it needs and the one that is good.

But the caramels become ill to you…

… and there are many people thus
in this world, they are ill.

They are looking for something.

There is an enormous, immense spider, there.

I do not go.
Dejame to see.

Where?
There above.

Muestrame.
You see It?

Ves the great thing
that they seem its bodies?

I know it, is revolting.

I am not created different
to other children…

… because we know Jesus
and we are hungry of Jesus.

Pero you know what?

It would not be different from other children…

… if all followed their call.

This it is the subject with the U.S.A.

The U.S.A. assumed
that it was the nation of God, truth?

Soon the things began to twist.

And now much people in the U.S.A.
she does not follow God.

It is well, we are going to receive
to the gentleman president now.

Let us speak to him. Let us say: “Welcome,
welcome president Bush ".

Welcome, president Bush.

“We are happy that here it is. ”
Happy that here it is.

I want that they give a blessing him.
That they give a blessing him.

Harian that? Raise its hands
and denle a blessing.

Do something on the war.

The war…

It has surrounded itself
of the full people of spirit…

… for that reason we pray by its spirit…

… it is here, came to visit to us.

Yes, Gentleman, thanks, Jesus.

They say to him: “Mr. President…
Mr. President…

… our nation under God ".

Mr. President…

… our nation under God!

The days pass express, truth?
Yes.

Yes, they flew, and this is the great night.

Yes.
Yes, you are ready?

We have some surprises
for you tonight, in agreement?

I want that feel,
with the together hands…

… the smiling faces,
watching towards there.

Hello, boys.

I am very contented tonight,
ground to speak with great people…

… but tonight I must speak to him
perhaps to the most important generation…

… of the history of the U.S.A.

Guau! And it is not a joke.

Where is the young person?
The young person of long hair.

They see here, son.

Parate to my side, how you are called?

I am called Levi.
Levi?

Guau, is a brilliant name, Levi.

They like that name?
Yes.

The subject is this.
Before you were born…

… God already knew you.

He is fantastic.

He said this. He said that you would form
in the belly of your mother.

Noneras a portion of protoplasma…

… or what was.

You are not a portion of weave
in the belly of your mother.

You were created deliberately
by God.

Is not incredible?

God wrote a book on your life
and He wrote:

“Levi, Levi will look for
to God from early age…

… and it will be a voice
that it will move to the U.S.A. ".

Yes!

“And this will not finish
in its adolescence…

… it will go by God in those days…

… and he will be a preacher ".

Yes!
“And to its 20 years…

… it will begin to make things
truely important for God…

… in the nation.

The dream of God, the life
of novel of Levi…

… signed by God ".

What seems to you?

It sounds brilliant.
It sounds brilliant, no?

You are brilliant.

Now escuchenme, boys.

From 1973,
near 50 million babies…

… they have not had the opportunity
to fulfill the dreams…

… that God had for its lives.

It is sad, truth?

A third of its friends…

… it could be here tonight,
but never they did it.

A person is a person,
she does not matter how small is.

God is a sleepy for them
as it has it for you.

You see It? He is amazing, no?
Sight that.

7 weeks of life.

Tonight, I create
that something is beginning…

… that can change the U.S.A.

Really, boys,
I believe that you are the beginning…

… of a movement that raises
the moral protests…

… that can finish with the abortion
in the U.S.A. and to change this.

You would like to be part
of that type of company?

Yes!

Jesus, I spill your blood…

… on my sins
and the sins of my nation.

God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again.

Upper. Jesus, I spill
your blood on my sins…

… and the sins of my nation.

God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again!

Life! Life! We demanded life, Gentleman to You,
in name of Jesus, life!

Satan, in name of Jesus, sueltalos.

You do not have to be able for apoderarte
of the life of the people…

… single God has that power.

Not more, Sir, not more.

Not more! Not more!

Adult, for 32 years
that we protested! Is too much!

Sir, we requested you by
the cuts of the U.S.A.…

… we requested to you because
change the cuts…

… because there are right judges…

… that legislates to favor
del that not yet been born, God!

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

God, is children saying, God.

Listening from the sky,
God, is hour.

Long time, Gentleman.

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

Abortion, God.
Right Judges!

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

Right Judges!
Right Judges!

Right Judges!

They made a pact
with God tonight…

… to say
by the aim of the abortion in the U.S.A.

They do not take that lightly,
they do not break its promises.

They are not the one who break promises,
be hacedores of history.

Creen that knows the U.S.A.?

I mean, creates
that they know its own country?

Well, I must say to them that no.

There is a religious political army…

… of soldiers still on there outside…

… that is being directed
by a political right.

One is not your mind
conspiring things…

… is happening!

This people… you know… are…

They do not seem politicians…

… they do not seem politicians…

… it does not seem that they…

… it seems… that they
they rise the car of anyone.

I mean, are looked like your neighbor.

But… When you put them
to all together ones…

… what ends up happening
it is that they take the control…

… in small slices,
and then……

This is the last stage.
I will say something to them.

They have taken
the White House, the Congress…

… the magistrature
by all a generation.

Together, this people
she forms a powerful one…

… I mean, a powerful one
block of voters.

Watch, George Bush and Karl Robs…

… they must to this people
great, great moments.

Been we have slept in the wheel…

… as this element
conservative, politician…

… fundamentalist…

… it has gained too much control
and to be able in this country.

It is totally
beyond my understanding…

… how somebody can watch
this photo and to say:

“Oh, you know that this… Yes…

“It does not affect to me”.
He is absurd.

It is an honor to announce the nomination…

… to Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr…

… like judge associate…

… of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

Definitively,
if the president treated…

… to replace to O'Connor,
a moderate one by an extremist…

… uh, would be the greatest fight
by the Supreme Court…

… of the history of the U.S.A.

This appointment of judge Alito
it is very important…

… because the Church
it needed to be involved.

He is everything what like Christians
it worries to us…

… because it so is opened
with the subjects of the life…

… and other subjects that are
so important for us.

This he is a little while crucial, crucial.

Judge Alito, our work
of 30 years…

… it is arriving at its culmination,
to the consumation, now.

Let us take to this man, Judge Alito…

… to the Supreme Court of the United States
and we advance a step forwards…

… so that the U.S.A. returns to be
a nation under God.

That God blesses to him.

Church of the New Life,
Colorado Springs

Colorado Springs has…

… the greater concentration of
evangelistas organizations of the U.S.A.

At megaiglesias of the city they arrive
Christian tourists of all the country.

# Your face is the unique thing that I see #

# And your days #

# Will be #

# A treasure #

# And my compensate #

# The only thing, yes,
only reason why alive #

# Oh, what incredible #

# A love beyond the explanation #

# You are beautiful #

We decided
that the Bible is the word of God.

We must not have
a general assembly…

… on which we create.

It is written in the Bible, truth?

For that reason we do not have to debate
on which we must believe…

… on the homosexual activity,
it is written in the Bible.

I believe that I know what you did last night.

If it give 1000 dollars me,
I will not tell it wife to your.

If you use something of this, I will demand to you.

I have a rule of the 10 years
on the pairs.

For that they are married
with somebody 30 years greater…

… I hope that he dies stops
that they can remain with his money.

But…

The point at which I want to arrive
it is that you must be safe…

… in its homes,
to have essential beliefs.

And we, like Americans…

… those that are citizen
of the United States…

… they need to be safe
of which our nation…

… it has an essential belief…

… and that we establish
these philosophies correctly…

… that our freedom
it is guaranteed. Amen?

Let us say together.
Father, in the powerful name…

… of Mr. Jesus,
we said by president Bush…

… because it is choosing a new one
candidate for the Supreme Court.

Damages forces
so that it lasts for always.

Sir, you do not let to us resign,
you do not allow that this struggles.

You do not allow that this negotiates.

Every day is an immense war,
allow that the battle begins.

You are understanding all this?
Yes, it is well.

You need arrepentirte.

He is beautiful.
Yes, he is amazing.

When they ignite all the lights
everything will shine here.

Hello, how are you?
Hello, how you are called?

My name is Levi.
Hello. Levi, Ted Haggard.

I am the main shepherd here.
The main one, yes, I imagined it.

It is well. You imagined it.
Yes.

How you are called?
That was a good sermon.

Was a good sermon?
Yes, it was it.

Dices some sermon?
Yes.

Which is your favorite subject?
My favorite subject?

The one of the faith.
That is my favorite subject.

-, Well fabulous.
Yes, I like much the one of the faith.

It likes people
to listen to your sermon?

It seems to be that all
they pay more attention to him.

“ Of whom it is east sermon”
Is by the content…

… or because you are a boy?

I do not know.
Yes. Good, already we will know it…

I believe that it is…
We will know It when you have 30.

I would say to you, takes advantage of this
of being a pretty boy…

… until you have 30…

… and by then
you will have a good content.

Let us think that
we must make emphasis…

… in people younger than you
so that your church…

… it grows of a healthful form.

The boys are it everything.

They love the evangelical message,
God loves them…

… the Bible is the word of God,
they are gifts of God.

Because while the state school
it says to them that they are animals…

… product of a natural selection…

… we say to them
that God loves them.

God has created them,
it gave an intention them in his life.

The boys adore that.

It is an enormous number of people
and we are growing.

Churches like this…
There is a new church thus…

… every two days in the U.S.A.

This has grown as much…

… that essentially
it influences in each election.

If the evangelistas vote,
they will determine the election.

Is a fabulous life!

#… nothing except
the blood of Jesus #

# What can do to us
absolutely again? #

# Nothing except the blood of Jesus #

# Oh, precious is the current #

# Destroys targets to Us like the snow #

# Is no another source for me #

# Nothing except the blood of Jesus #
We sing for this nation.

# How we can wash
our sins? #

# Nothing except the blood of Jesus #

Amen. Well.

The Bible says that
of the mouth of babies…

… God has ordered to us to say…

… to shut up to the enemy,
to the adversary and the avenger.

God wants to use to smallest
in order to disturb to the wise person…

… that the things that do not matter
they do not annul the things that yes matter.

Viste the great towers…

… the great constructions
and the great men?

God says that the orations of the children
they can make shake to kings.

We go, aleluya.

They are training to us
in order to leave and to train to others…

… to train to others to be the Army
of God and to make the will of God…

… what It wants that you do.

I feel that they are to us
training to be soldiers…

… single that of an amused way.

Not… I do not feel
the fear sensation…

… of which I am going to die in the battle
or something that you would feel…

… when you really go to the war.

There is peace in all this also.

There is excitation and peace at the same time.

He is brilliant.

You know, much people
it dies by God and others…

… and they…
they are not scared.

They do not feel fear of that
nor of no other thing.

And it is like…
my papa said to me…

… when their papas were missionaries…

… it had to go to a place
very dangerous…

… they jumped and shouted:
“ Martyr, martyr”.

He is brilliant.

Parate.

You are a young man, levantate.

I know a powerful soldier for God,
thus it is, son.

You parate there. There you go, Joseph.

Someday you could be
the head of the government…

… who knows, Joseph.
He dreams dreams.

How you are called? Austin?

Lights affluent with that tape in the mouth.

We go. Very well,
here you have, youngster…

… you are very enthusiastic, I love you.

Some liberal ends…

… they would have to watch this
and they would begin to shake in its boots.

The intensity that you see in these children…

… doubt does not fit
of which they would have to watch this…

… and they would say: “Oh, God mine,
it did not know that this was possible.

And how they will be these children
when they grow “.

It is an instinct animal that people
feel envies, you know?

It wants to see intensity…
You want to see children…

… enthusiastic by Christ.
Thus he is this, you know.

And I must believe my heart yet…

… that this is single
the end of iceberg.

I believe that these children
they will have an impact in the sky.

God listens to the weeping of the children.

Uy! It makes me cry.

We are with Becky
in Bismarck, Dakota of the North.

She is shepherd of children
and she directs a summer camping…

… for evangelistas children
there, in Dakota of the North.

Becky, how are you?
I feel well.

So that young? So that one assumes
that they are the new army of God?

So that they use the children
in order to do that?

Whatever it works
with children it knows that…

… the reason by which
you work with children…

… it is because what they learn…

… at the age of 7, 8, 9 years…

… it remains there
by the rest of its lives…

… and there are statistics
that they can investigate…

-… by you yourself…
No, I… I…

I know these statistics,
but it used the term “to learn”.

The word “to learn”
it is different “to indoctrinate”.

God gave a brain us…

… God gave the freedom us to choose…

… and to learn it is part of that election.

And I believe that whenever
the fundamentalist movement, Becky…

… it interferes with that,
we are making damage…

… we are making damage
to the evolution of the humanity.

I do not believe that any boy
arrive at that by election.

Reason why I understood, your question was…

… if it seems to me that it is well
that the fundamentalism…

… it indoctrinates its children
with its beliefs.

I believe, fundamentally, that yes.

Because all the other religions
they are indoctrinating his children.

Hello? I would like to see
more churches indoctrinating.

To the children you can say to them
what is.

As I say,
you can say to him to a boy…

You can turn a boy
in a soldier whom a AK-47 loads.

You can call washed it of brain…

… but I am enthusiastic and radical
in teaching to the children…

… on its responsibility
like Christians…

… as well as the fear of God,
like Americans, if they want to arrive…

Good, Becky,
dejame preguntarte this.

How to ignore that of which
we are not creating suddenly…

… young soldiers
for the Republican Party?

What has to do this…

… with which Christ said…

… on how we must live
our Earth life?

It is… I am not safe…
I do not know of any church…

… that has a political cause.

I… I do not persecute
to my children politically…

… but that, you know… because
at the same time I mean…

… that I do not have any problem
in saying to him to my boys…

… that we are in favor of the life.

I say that God to them
he is observing to us…

… God has… and I…
And God has a very special place…

… for those people
that they damage our children.

It is not a pretty place.
Sabes what?

I am not going to go there, Mike.

Sabes which always did
that this country was special?

What it always differentiated to this country…

… it is that there is something we called…

… the separation between Church and State.

Always there are outstanding for that reason…

… and there are outstanding during 200 years.

This worked.

I concern your right
like fundamentalist…

… to teach to your children
what is that you want to teach to them…

… but you do not leave blood it
stain the public sector.

You do not leave stains
of blood the schools.

I am not in agreement with you,
the Christianity is important.

Let us think that it is the religion
more important in the world…

… because it changes the life of people.

Pero Becky, is a witch potion,
it will be appropriated the democracy.

You know, I I believe that the democracy…

… it is the political system
greater on the Earth…

… but single that,
he is only… the unique one…

… he is the unique thing on the Earth…

… and in last instance it is designed
in order to destroy itself to itself…

… because we must give him
to all the same freedom…

… and in the end that
it will destroy us.

And then the perfect world
it is not going to be perfect…

… until Jesus
be the true Gentleman.

Becky, thanks to be with us.

Don't mention it.

God mine!
I have one more an interview.

At the most I listen on this…

… that is to say, every time
he is more crazy.

58 votes to favor, 42 against.

The nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr…

… of New Jersey
to be judge associate…

… of the Supreme Court
of the United States…

… it is confirmed.

Master America,
master the American style of life.

Master to be part of century XXI.

I wake up every day to me
with desire to make things…

… but at the same time I observe
this old and ill world…

… and I say: “God, sacanos of here”.

Knowing what I know…

… how not to dedicate all my life…

… to help another people,
children, adolescents and adults…

… that comes to save the knowledge
of Jesus Christ?

How it could enjoy the sky…

… being conscious that
that I never said to him to people…

… that as much matters to me
who is Jesus?

That is not a load, is
the greatest joy of my life.

The most religious nation
in the world it is India.

The less religious nation
in the world it is Sweden.

We are a nation of Indians
governed by Swedish.

Like Christians, you are the leaders,
you speak by God.

We worried about our country.
And what I mean it is…

… that we want that it is heard
our message. We can reduce it to…

She said, to reduce…

… your message to simple orations.

I will say some simple orations to you.

Number one, is a new day.

Number two,
liberalism is dead.

Number three, most of
the Americans are preservative.

Number four, has us
in order to show and to speak with clarity.

And number five,
leaves Church it rises!

Thanks, Dr Sutton.
