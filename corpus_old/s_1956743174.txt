Report on unregistered citizens,
assess the situation and report back.

Hello, confirmed availability
unregistered citizens.

Armed with small arms.

00:02:3 6,056 --> 00:02:37,343
We are leaving.

Let's get the hell out of here!
Come on, let's run!

We leave, we leave. Get out of here!
We are running!

Store weapons according to the rules.

Clean weapons are safe weapons.

Subject refuses to respond.

Remove his barcode and enter it
to the dead list.

This is the last one we arrested
at the old missile complex "Sabina".

Raise your hand for identification.

Raise your hand for identification.

She has no barcode.
She is not registered.

What is this costume made of?

The scanner just goes crazy.

Costume.

Some ... metal.
Metal.

Do you have a name

Metal. Costume.

Yes, I'm interested in yours
metal suit.

This is some kind of uniform
your group?

29th
Metal, braid box.

thirty
Do you have any documents?
“No, but there is some property.”

Why do you need these photos?

Is this some kind of code?

They serve as a pass for someone
who is waiting for you?

Why are you carrying these photographs with you?

Photo.

Sub-in.

She is either short-sighted or almost dumb.

Or very smart ...

Subject has no barcode.

Unregistered, signs of mental
deviations, add to the list of deceased.

No, wait a minute.
Let's do it differently.

Send her under surveillance.

Complete psychological and medical
examination. Take off your clothes and carry out analyzes.

And bring her things to the investigation department,
I'm already late.

Her file. She has no barcode,
I need to somehow name the dossier.

“Was she found at the old Sabina complex?”
Yes, sir.

So call it - Sabina.

“It costs money, guys.”
Of money. Are you asking for money for this liquid shit?

Hey baby, check it out. We have a business here.
Oh, thanks, cool.

fifty
How are you?
There will be questions, please contact.

If I promise to read it,
can i buy you a drink?

Sorry, I don’t drink, I have a job.

Well, when will you finish the job?
Maybe ... maybe tomorrow?

Or on Thursday?
Every Thursday I am free.

Or maybe after the day after tomorrow?

This is a seductive offer.

Don't be so busy
could have agreed.

“Only the revolution worries, no entertainment?”
And there is.

Well, if you ever want to become
mother of my children, find me, okay?

Okay.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.558
But, a man who wants children,
should think about the future. If he is a man ...

00:13:52.5 19 --> 00:13:53,927
Why are you doing this?

For the sake of our unborn children.

Dumb kids.

We’d better sit at home,
and don’t give out that shit, right?

00:14:15.8 51 --> 00:14:17,207
Well, maybe that makes sense.

I think no. In my opinion they are
just stupid kids and they need to stay at home.

The disease!

Black clouds, demons from the depths of hell!
Ask questions, gentlemen!

Paramilitary larvae,
come from the void, from the ground!

To devour our glorious society!

Ask questions, maggots!
Ask questions!

Ask questions, good people,
try to change. You should not...

Oh - this is my warlike friend
I remember you last night.

“How are you, buddy.” Do you need something?
Get up.

"Get up."

I already know it. Maybe you’ll come up with something new?
And I will try to remember.

For some reason I have a hunch that you
here not to make me breakfast.

Bring him to your senses. If you still think
that he's funny ... Let me know.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.585
I will not refuse again with him
to do it.

Hello. Speaks information
Bureau of the Central Office.

An anxiety of the first degree is declared.

It’s a good idea to make an escape.
To know more how to get out of here.

It's alright man, I researched this
the place when they brought me. Come on.

Hush, lady, you and I are not enemies.

What are you waiting for, just cut it down
do not pull.

So, I give you one last chance,
or close your mouth, or I will break your neck.
Sa-bina.

At least we know
that she speaks English.

00:20:47.225 --> 00 :20:49.301
Since we are here, we will perish together ...

... let's call each other by name.
I am Danny Girard.

Ah, you're not talkative, are you?

Well, since you know how to get out of here,
maybe you can push a wheelbarrow to us?

Wheelbarrow!

Yes, a car. Well - a car, a car.
Okay, listen ...

We are running - you are running.
We get up - you get up. Clear?

Get out of here.

Yeah, I'm alone against the whole world.
Hold on Go.

I knew this was a reverse.

Most importantly, be on your guard
if real problems begin.

Please stop the car.

Can you explain one thing to me?
What are you doing at all?

This is my territory, I know
what’s what. You follow her.

Wheelbarrow. Car.

Go to her, please.
Get busy.

Okay, here's what I'll do. I will look for my people.
If you two want to act alone, ..

... I will find something to do,
which suits you.

You won’t have to deal with communication issues.
and be part of a battle group. Come on.

On the roof of this building will need
put a sniper.

One more here.
Here, mine the road.

There will be about a hundred and three.
The first wave will go from here.

We will act according to the same plan,
as in the northern sector.

“All communication will be through you.”
I'm listening.

Few people just came up
to the main entrance.

Skip them.
Skip them.

Turn off the lights, close the door.

Okay, okay, easy.

If I have two hundred guys like you -
for a week I would deal with this mess.

Hi, Danny.
Grubert.
“Good to see you again.”

Someone is missing. Come out boy
everything is fine, we are at home.

You have a cozy place.

What the hell are you doing here?

Funny colonel i just
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

You are a useless fool.

Appear when they are not waiting for you
and do not want to see.

From reliable sources, I found out that you were killed
in New York during the food wars of the 98th.

Do not trust the rumors
Colonel Slater.

Forget about the colonel.
Just John Slater.

Wait a minute, but you were always good
government guy, colonel.

“Are you now a rebel?”
Nothing but the form has changed.

And you are the same. You never worried
other people's lives, you are not a team player.

You were not expected here. We have already won.
I just direct them in the right direction.

And this direction you choose, Colonel?
No, not me.

The world was based on brilliant ideas.
People ceased to doubt the leaders - that’s what happened.

World ruled by the military. I just want to,
so that everything becomes as before.

Alright, Colonel. We are leaving.
The girl will stay.

“Until we find out who she is and what she needs.”
She is with me.

It turns out that you spend some time here.

I received a report from the Central Office:
the prisoners fled.

Three prisoners participated in the escape.

None of them are marked
especially important.

Standard Award Details Indicated
for catching the runaways. That's all.

They don't seem to consider your escape
they will not be looking for something important and seriously.

Or maybe they want us to think
that it is not so important.

We are also about information traders
did not hear.

Everything suits me.
Show me where the door is, and I'll leave.

Yes? Where to?

Back to the interrogation room
to turn us in?

Come on, man
if it weren’t for me, I wouldn’t be here.

Or maybe if it weren’t for them - you won’t
would you arrest? Do you know what a setup is?

Yes, this is nonsense!
Nonsense? Well, remember ...

00 :30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,657
You are both right, we cannot trust them.
But you can’t let them go until we find out.

How long does it take?
“Maybe two hours.”

Let's do it. Just in case.

Good morning. Speaks information
Bureau of the Central Office.

Action order entered into force
in conditions of chemical pollution.

Requires a detachment to work in conditions
chemical pollution.

“Good to see you again.”
“Good to see you, sir.”

I think it's worth getting rid
from extra ears.

Hold it, be kind.
Listen up

I only have a few minutes.
Now the army is not what it used to be.

When you were an officer and served with me,
everything was different ...

Now there is one paperwork everywhere.

Politics, calculations.
Lunches, dinners.

We are trying to change the course of history.

“This was not what I expected when I started working.”
“Yes, sir, I can imagine.”

So...

About this escape.

Escape?

Looks like some talker overheard
that you let the three captives escape.

“Sir, I reported it.”
Please let me finish.
Yes, sir.

Have a little check
at first nothing unusual was found.

00:32:21.5 65 --> 00:32:25.339
But the woman ...
a woman interested them.

They began to check further.
“Sir, it was I who sent her for examination.”

The effectiveness of your methods
and your dedication, I never doubted.

But since I'm the head of security,

everything received passes through me
information.

I suspect you have not read the reports
about her physical and mental form?

00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:48.546
“No sir.”
“Did you know that her intelligence is twice as high ...”

... all recorded
in the history of indicators?

Sir, I saw her only during
preliminary interrogation.

How old do you think she is?

A medical examination revealed
that her cells have no signs of aging.

0 0:33:06,617 --> 00:33:10,695
She has a newborn metabolism.

The report also indicates that in her body
no signs of disease were found.

She never got sick, even as a child,
there is not the slightest trace.

And the clothes that were on her?

The material has no analogues known to science.

Humanity has not yet encountered such a thing.
We have a problem.

You let the extremely dangerous
prisoner to escape.

Now you have to find her.

Find out who or what she is.

Find out what she needs ...

So captain, I got access
to the dossier.

Two more passwords and I can ...
get to our lady’s file.

If it is stored with the rest.
If not...

... try to look for him in business
security personnel.

Come on, Gruber, do everything you can.
Why are you silent?

The central government considers you a spy.
Do you know what they do with spies?

Sabina.
She is either short-sighted or almost dumb.

Or very smart.

The girl does not think anything at all.

Since she is now with us,
we have two exits ...

Let them grab her, set her free
or take it with you.

I heard they don’t really stand on ceremony
with runaway prisoners.

At last!

I'm in the dossier of the arrested!

Now I’ll look for the codes of prisoners cards.

00:34:45.779 --> 0 0:34:48.888
Unless, of course, you yourself remember them.

I spent too little time there
to get a card.

And you?
Do you remember what they called your dossier?

Sabina. So call it.
Yes, sir.

We have nothing to lose.
Try entering Sabina.

The secret dossier is open.

Oh shit, it worked!

00:35:11.26 9 --> 00:35:13.022
The dossier was transferred
to the central committee.

What does it mean to put it
human language, slater?

That means she's free
and is of utmost importance.

This information is only available to three
members of the Central Committee.

“So we can't find out who she is?”
Not.

It just won't be that easy.

Times are not easy now.

Rebels are constantly organizing
groupings.

As a percentage, it is noticeable
the number of deserters increased.

Everyone's nerves are on edge, Quinn.

Every day there are new rumors
new questions.

Even my position is vulnerable.
It can affect us all.

Queen, I want you to find this woman.
Wherever and with whoever she is.

Arrest anyone
but I need her alive.

I want to know what she does here
and I know that I can rely on you.

This is extremely important.

Hey, calm down, insolent.

Find out where the headquarters is
rebel Brendt and bring it to me.

Immediately.

People must see.

Welcome to the information
Bureau of the Central Office.

Barcode 537-9654, Level 2 clearance.
Report to prison no. 9.

Expect further directions.

Fire reached a temperature of 1000 degrees
on the celsius scale.

And the result? Nothing!

00:3 8:17,554 --> 00:38:21,792
No burns, not even marks.
Not even hot to the touch.

“The material seems to have absorbed all the heat.”
Good.

It turns out that we have an escaped prisoner,
heat resistant and with the brains of a professor?

“Is that all you say?”
“That's all I will say.”

I'm not here of my own free will, Queen.
And it does not make me happy.

You show me the secret files
which no one knows about. This is even worse.

I feel it will bring
I'm in some kind of trouble.

Queen, lay me everything
what do you know about the upcoming business.

We suspect the woman is an alien.

Yes, you are probably joking.
“There is no other explanation.”

No one knows why she flew in
but she is here.

And the Central Office wants to know
what for.

I was assigned to find her
and I instruct you to do this directly.

“A worthy reward awaits you.”
“Do you know how long this can take?”

“She could be anywhere.”
I do not think so.

She escaped with two other prisoners
one of them is a famous rebel.

Who's that?

00:39:38, 233 --> 00:39:41,931
Judging by the barcode,
it belongs to a can of Chinese mushrooms.

Made in Taiwan, 1987.

There is clearly some kind of mistake.

Release date
www.kosmoaelita.com

Remember, first of all we want
make an accident

... which will show the World Central
management that not everything is in their power.

Kick their asses.
Yes, let's go!

You should take a look at this.

Wait a bit. Hubert received
access to the catalog of files.

What is in your hands is the reason
that her files were transferred to a closed file.

Come on, Slater. Central Office
specially left these files for you to stumble upon.

“They're fooling you, man.”
I do not think so.

It is unlikely that they would become
risk secret files ...

... just to get us
on the wrong track.

Come on, Grub, is she that,
look like an alien from Pluto?

“Did you know anyone from Pluto?”
“Good thing you asked.” There was one chick ...

I don’t know if she understands our speech,
but if he understands, then he knows where we are.

You are a serious threat to them.

They will concentrate all their forces,
to find you, and that will betray us.

I...

I ... was ... not ready ... to talk ...

I didn’t fully absorb the basics
your communication process.

So guys are a joke, right?

I also understand that your tribe
does not wish me harm.

You are different from the rest.

If you prepare questions,
I will answer them.

It was decided to conduct an investigation.

Discovered documents of earthlings showed
that your species has formed an equal society.

Gruber, do you understand anything?

Maybe she’s talking about NASA’s old probes,
created to search for extraterrestrial civilizations.

They were launched a very long time ago.

Gruber, and what kind of documents were
on these probes?

Images...
No, you call them "photos."

00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:52.345
Description of the different peoples of the Earth.
Where and how they live.

There were images of others ...
... the leaders of your tribes. Their peaceful meetings.

But ... the photos do not reflect what
what i saw.

In recent years, there have been some changes.
Explain to me the context of this statement.

Some leaders stopped smiling
to each other ... They started to kill.

But you can return to the former
conditions, if you replace these leaders.

“Is that the reason for your clash with them?”
Yes.

Then we cannot learn anything from you.
We had the same conflict.

Lady, I in no way want to hurt you.
But where did you leave your spaceship?

Spaceship?

He is asking,
how will you come back.

Energy cycle.

The cycle is temporarily suspended until
until I continue it.

He is in the place
where I ended up when I arrived on Earth.

The place is called - "Sabina".

The last question is what will happen
if you don’t come back?

The energy cycle that will bring me back
home has already begun.

If I don’t have time in time,
The next cycle will begin.

I must return, or I will die.

It would be better for them to catch this bitch.

Leave me alone!
I have nothing!

Ask questions, do you have any questions?

This is a map of the former suburb.

Red lines - metro scheme.
Now it is not used.

This is the Sabina complex.

If your statements are true
there you were arrested by members of the central administration.

They are true.
I would not make empty statements.

At first she was silent, but now she speaks
about "empty statements". Did she swallow a dictionary?

What is the area of ??this territory?

A few hundred square miles
terrain urban type, the conditions are not the best.

But most likely this is the only way
Avoid Central Office.

Yes, everything is under control there.
Vehicle Tracking System.

Everything that moves is immediately displayed.
on their monitors.

You need to avoid the surface,
have to go the other way.

It will take more time.
But you will succeed.

I hate to watch my soldiers
mistreat a woman. I hate it.

But you got homemade bombs
and anti-government literature.

Many of my soldiers are killed
such bombs.

Tell me the name of your leader,
name of group, allies?

And I promise
you will no longer be harmed.

I can not hear you.

What? Tell me.

Power station...
Power station?

They won’t hurt you anymore.

You have to understand
we did not always live as we are now.

We just trusted the wrong people.

Once we lived guided by
high principles and reasonable laws.

But we got lost, like you.

Now we have to
get back on track.

This is our rulebook.
Formula, if that’s more clear to you.

Once it worked
may help again.

The Central Administration sent a detachment
to search for prisoners. Get ready!

“We'll blow them.”
You know what to do, we are moving forward!

This is your chance, Willy.
You wanted to leave - leave, but on one condition ...

Take her to the Sabina base.
“That's what I planned.”

Keep an eye on her, Willie.

Okay, let's go, take you home.

Danny.
Yeah.

Be careful, man.

Agreed.

Run, run.

Squad "Rem" - go to exit number 3.
Danny, start the countdown.

This is for you.
Thanks buddy.

By the way, Gruber, you look,
do not use these things for nothing.

Don’t worry, Danny, I was just about to
test the new model. Come on, my dear!

Try to catch me!
Take him!

You lose the war, Quinn.

You are an interesting person, Brian.

Your work is simple.

They gave you a trace, and just follow it.

00:56:45.604 --> 00:56:47.713
Like a bloodhound.

And arrest whoever you need
the state pays me for this.

Track down and arrest.

Or kill them.

This is already starting to bother me.

Maybe I was killing the wrong people?

Or maybe I'm just getting
old and soft.

See you soon, boss.

Listen to me. You have to run.
I'll find you later, okay?

Go on. Come on. Come on!

Not bad, not bad, not bad.

00:59:45.693 --> 00:59:47,805
So what the hell ...

For the sake of all the saints
what is she doing here?

The bull's eye!

The bull's eye!

You have not heard before
this song?

No, I don’t know ... songs.

This is normal, most people
not very musical.

But partly it's sad
you know, now in our crazy world ...

... there are not many good things left.
Good music, good booze, and of course ...

...Good people.

You know, when I met you, I thought
that you don’t understand anything at all in music.

Do not consider it an insult.

But you act so at ease
what you might think, you drank a little, but hardly.

The men remain.
Is a man waiting for you somewhere?

The man? Another kind?

They called me differently, but this
not heard yet. But yes, yes. You could say that.

Do you have a man?
“Yes, but I left him there.”

“Ah, he mistreated you, right?”
Not.

I like this man.
He helped me.

Wait a moment. He helped you
you like him, why did you leave him?

Such people need to stay close!

He cannot return with me.
If he tries, he will die.

“Well, so go with him.”
“Then I will die.”

Here is this man!

Wheelbarrow!

How are you?
I'm fine, I made friends with this ...

... male

This is me, hi.

Hey, you look familiar. You are one of
escaped prisoners or a bar visitor?

Visitor, regular customer.

Well then get in, I'll take
where do you need it.

Maybe I'm something intelligible
I’ll hear from you. Come on, get in.

By the way, what about your singing?

Here is what I will tell you.

Let's sing one jazz song now.

Boogie-woogie style, and then bebop style.

Let's see how I can help.

Good luck

This thing has been rubbing my nerves for a year now.
Hey, come, I will show you the house.

I got a little mess here
you need to tidy up a bit.

This is my backyard.

01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.275
Flower. I myself raised it in my garden.

These are my pets, yeah.
Henrietta, Rosetta.

And this is my garden.

They are beautiful!

I would like to feed them!
Feed?

What are you from another planet?
Yes!

That's what, I go down to the house and cook
some corn tortillas.

They are beautiful. Are they harmless?
“Yes, they will not bite.”

Here's what, look.

Hold it to you.

How about you, huh?

We have a problem with the truck,
one has to go check on how he is.

But if you want, I have a drink in my house.
Yes, a drink, sir!

Pour yourself a drink, huh?
Let's get out of here.

Come on!

What do we have here?

Hey listen, listen.

Here, here is what I have for you.

Look, in fact - this is ...

Money. There is a lot of money!
Many, you can take everything!

Let's.

Well, just look.

Release me and the girl, okay?

01:07:45.576 --> 01:07:48.642
You're not quite in that position
to bargain!

So I earned it.

And what will my good friend wish
and partner?

And, it seems he has already made a decision.

Don’t touch the girl, okay?

Of course...

How glad I am to return.

Here is my home ...

Wait a minute. Do not run away.

I'm a friend ... okay?

01:09:48.1999 --> 01:09:49.814
I am a friend.

Do you understand this word?

I know the meaning of this word.

But it is not consistent
with your actions.

They wanted to hurt me.

I remember you.

You were with a different tribe.
They also wanted to harm me.

I know. And you are right.
But that was a mistake.

They did not know who you were.

I was just doing the work.

“I think you want to take me prisoner again.”
“I will not come any closer.”

I will not move from this place.

Now we know who you are.

“We want to help.”
It is not true.

01:11:46.988 --> 01:11:48.031
Anyone take a chance?

The gut is thin?

Scum!

Not!

Who the hell are you!

Your tribe ...

“Your people have taken my freedom from me.”
You're right.

But they did not know who you are.

They thought you were an enemy
like these people.

These are bad people.

They captured a man named Willy.

And a man named Danny.
They are not bad people.

He is dead.

The one who helped you?

I found him.

But you no longer need to worry.

I will help you. Believe me.

I believed ...

Not those ... people ...

You can believe me.

You already saw this place
why come back here?

That is what I would like to find out.

Who is waiting for you? Your comrades?
Man in white? Your leader

Maybe he is your leader.

In that case, we will meet
together. You...

I...

And Bryant.

Hey, upstart!

So, so, so what is here with us.

A person with many faces.
Where is she?

Forget about her.
It is written off.

Her place in history.
Kaput. The end.

Tell me what you want. Central
Management got to her.

Interrogate her, find out everything,
and then put on the laboratory bench ...

... and find out what it's made of.

Do not do this, Willy.

Stay where you are. Or die.
Do not make me do my job.

Good...

Look at me.
I know who you are.

I know all about your friends.

Your comrades ...

About their plans.

I said look at me!

I do not wish you harm.

I just need answers.

Tell me who you are.

Very dramatic.

A man full of mysteries.

A man without a past.

And without a future.

Let her go, Queen.
She will die if she stays here.

Kill him.

Let's not complicate
to each other's life.

I need only a girl.

I promise you they won’t send her
to the research lab.

She’s more useful to me alive.

Come on, faster! ..
