[Lilly and Anna Screaming] Aaahh!!!





Long before the Native Americans were even here


You sound like a dork

He's trying to pick a fight you know..


[CHIEF NADJO] I hope you don't plan on camping around here this weekend.


[CHIEF NADJO] That's important work.

But there is no camping this weekend

All the local tribes gather for The Blood Moon ceremonies

So the reservation are off limits
[Professor Interrupting] My name is Richard Stein

and this piece of paper here says that we have state clearance to be here.

As you can see that's a state property.


[CHIEF NADJO] Your teacher is kind of a Dick


[CHIEF NADJO] It's a dangerous time right now

tread carefully



[RANGER STEVE] Hey Richard, how's it going?



Okay? I didnâ€™t think youâ€™d be here so soon.


He is gonna let us stay here overnight and use the park facilities

[RANGER STEVE] Hey guys

Iâ€™ll be at the station all weekend while yâ€™all are here, okay?

Ready to go?



I would let him patrol my wetland

Right? i would let him explore my marsh

heh, yest? Iâ€™d let him motorboat through my swampy Netherlands

[Anna and Wendy] Eww...


[RANGER STEVE] Ready to go?









[RANGER STEVE] Hey Sweetheart, you are gonna be fine okay?

I am gonna be at station all weekend

[All Shouting] Get on the boat, Com'on!

Boys, i want you to gather some fire woods when you are done setting up.

So we can have a fire tonight









[RANGER STEVE] There is a radio in the data lab. if you have an emergency, you contact me

You have ruined it

It was the only one that even worked out here








Come on


i don't know anything

Panther

when there's panthers and bears out there all by myself


Now shake hands and go






Come on let's go


I didn't expect all that shit to happen

You got to understand

Last thing i thought i'd be doing this weekend is hanging out with science club

But Professor Stein you know he called me in and gave me an ultimatum

Here i am


and he knows that today's the most

important game of my life and he still made me come here

It's the qualifier for the state finals which are tomorrow

I just hope my team can pull it off you know


you coming?

I am gonna wait for the rain

little bit


[Professor Stein] Glad you finally decided to join our mandatory meeting




We found that around here last week



Look i am sorry. As a man of science
if you are implying that whole Big foot Legend

then you are being ridiculous

Its a sample


You see Professor i found one of those

in those "deer-nest" last week

As a man of science i look to find a truth

and the unknown..


Look we'll start collecting samples first thing in the morning

Hopefully we're out of here by six or seven o'clock


Don't you think?


just drag us into the river or something crazy


What was that...

Skunk ape stuff you and Professor were talking about when i went into the lab



They have this horrible stench

You can always smell them because you see them



Once when i was six

Just once




just about a mile from here

Me and friend were playing in the backyard close to the woods

We looked up and there it was

staring right at us

Just a few yards away

It looked like this huge

Orangutan on two feet

With his piercing eyes

Then we heard this horrible crying sound come from the woods

And boom, took off, Gone!

Never saw it again

Told our parents
ofcourse nobody believed us

Now i won't be able to sleep tonight


Sometimes..when i am out here in the woods alone


i could still see it's eyes

Looking at me through the trees


You are freaking me out!




Oh my god


[MACK FARTS]

[ALL SHOUTING]



[Everyone Irritated]



[Everyone Laughs]



Go... raccoon
Don't worry about them raccoons

Come on... let me see
Lift me up or something

As far as samples go.
Scoop a little water off at the top here
