Hi!

Man on phone: You need to hurry!

The wedding's already started.

Yes, I'm here now. Just
keep them entertained.

I'll be there in
a jiff. Okay, bye.

No, no, no! Not again!

Ugh! Okay.

Here's the deal. You
can break down tomorrow,

I'm free all day, but I
can't do this right now.

Got it?

Oh, I owe you one!

Come on, little guy.

I know it doesn't seem like
it, but if you come with me,

you will be free to fly away,

migrate and help
pollinate the world.

What do you say?

Where is she?

Come on.

Come on! Oh! Hey.

They're about to say their vows.

I know, I know, trust me,

everything that could go
wrong today has gone wrong.

Well, this one can't.

They've only paid
us half so far.

Pastor: Having witnessed
their pledge of fidelity

to one another...

To love, honour, and
cherish one another

in the presence
of this gathering.

And by the power vested in me,

it is my honour to now
pronounce you husband and wife.

Now you may kiss the bride.

Crowd: Aww.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm just happy for her.

And happy that we
pulled this off.

I'm your best friend, Emily.
I know it still hurts.

I'm over it.

It's not something
you just get over.

Well, you're the one
who keeps bringing it up

every time we do a wedding.

And I told you I can handle
the weddings on my own.

Come on.

Let's go get ready for
tomorrow's birthday party.

Does anyone know what
kind of butterfly this is?

How about the birthday girl?

A blue butterfly!

Emily: That's true, it is blue.

And close, it's called
an Eastern Tailed Blue.

He just emerged yesterday.

How do you know if it's a boy?

See the black spots on
the top of his wings?

The females don't have them.

Amanda: What's he doing?

It takes a few hours
for his wings to dry

and harden enough
for him to fly.

Is he going to fly away?

Mm-hm. Pretty soon.

This is all very new to him.

Does anyone know what
we butterflies eat?

Man: Fruit slices.

Or sugar water.

Yes, very good.

Daddy, she was asking us.

Sorry.

Don't worry, he won't hurt you.

It tickles.

That's because he knows you're
just sweet as sugar water.

Where is he going?

He's off to do his
part in the world.

I have some more Eastern
Tailed Blues over here.

Come see.

That weasel.

My neighbour?

No, Mandy Fischer.

I booked that party too

and she swooped in
and undercut me again.

Garrett: Oh, yeah, I think
got a flyer from her.

And she was cheaper.

Well, there's reason for that.

Oh, Mandy!

Mandy: Emily! Nice party.

A whopping one butterfly
you released there, huh?

Hmm, yeah, we like to teach
our party guests a thing or two

about butterflies
before we set them free.

Yawn. They must love that.

Passing off any moths
as monarchs today?

Whatever.

Time for me to run.
Gotta release a few more.

Several more.

More, as in, more than you.

Hey, I... I only paid for 25.

Oh, this is on the house.
I won't be out-butterflied.

Hey, kids! Come over here now!

Kids: Wow! Whoa!

Girl: So many! Look
at the big one!

And more!

Are you kidding me?

Oh, come on, little guys.

Girl: They're so colourful!

Who wants to see more?

How'd it go?

Great, five dozen new
Blue Swallow Tails

are out making the
world a better place.

I thought we only had
two dozen for this party.

Yeah, there was an incident.

What kind of incident?

A Mandy Fischer
kind of incident.

Emily! I know! I know!

I'm sorry. I
couldn't help myself.

She's just so smug.

And I think she shorts
people on butterflies.

That goes against the code.

"The code?"

Okay, we had a
bumper crop anyway.

That's beside the point.

Half of her butterflies
were probably fake.

Garrett: Emily?

Oh.

Uh, sorry, before you leave,
Amanda wanted to say bye.

Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

Is that the dad?

Yes, it's the dad.

What?

Stop it.

Anytime. Seriously.

I look forward to your call.

Anytime.

Toodles.

Oh, uh, you... You
left this behind.

Emily: Oh, actually,
here. Take one.

Put it up at your
office or something.

Free advertising.

Look, I just want to thank you.

You know, for the
extra butterflies.

Kids had a great time.

Sorry if it got weird.

Weird? What's weird about two
dueling butterfly parties?

I think your friend Mandy
got a kick out of it too.

Friend...

Between you and me,
that educational bit,

it was a nice touch.

The kids, they
weren't bored at all.

Thank you.

Amanda? Come over here.

The nice lady is leaving.

Great, I'm the "nice lady."

Aww.

Thank you so much, this was
the best birthday party ever.

Oh, I'm so glad! I hope the
rest of it is just as fun.

Thanks, Emily. Bye!

Bye!

It was a pleasure meeting you.

Yeah, you too.

Oh, uh, sorry.

Hey, Jill. I'm so
glad you called.

Yeah, I'm just with
Amanda right now.

Jill could be anybody.

Like who? His mother.

Who calls their mother
by her first name?

His sister, a
business colleague.

Nah, not the way he answered it.

Mandy I can handle.

Jill is the unknown.

But it doesn't matter because he
probably thinks I'm crazy anyway

after my showdown at
the butterfly corral.

No, he thought that was funny.
I thought that was crazy.

Is that from today?

Mm-hm.

And how did you get it?

When you went to say goodbye
to your hot single dad,

one of the parents was
about to throw it away.

I rescued it.

Mm-hm. You rescued it?

Yeah, how about you
rescue a salad later?

Mmm.

Okay, fine. And I was not going
over to say goodbye to him.

I was invited over to say
goodbye to his daughter.

Mm-hm, by him.

We're not supposed to
flirt with clients anyway,

it's bad etiquette.

The point is, this is
the first time in a year

you've even shown
so much as a pulse

in the presence of another
guy. That is progress.

Well, he is cute.

And he's nice.

And unavailable.

Sweetheart?

Hey! You know,

the doorbell does work.

Nonsense. Adam!

How are you doing?

Just fine, Larry.

Well, I thought we'd bake.

You know, to help you
get your mind off things.

Dad, it's been a year.

I don't need to keep
taking my mind off things.

Nonsense. A father knows.

Oh, did you happen to
call that young man

I met at the gas
station the other day?

You mean the perfect
stranger who probably thought

you were insane?

He gave me his number!
He was interested.

You made it sound like I
was desperate for a date.

You are. Dad!

Aww, poor kid.

I'm just trying to
look out for you.

Okay, can we do this tomorrow?
It's been a long day.

You raise butterflies.
How hard can that be?

Um, incredibly hard, actually.

Catch you later. Bye, Larry.

Oh, you're leaving?

Oh, I have a date.

See?

I thought that was canceled.

See ya.

Just gonna rescue this.

Well, looks like it's just us.

Just us.

Okay, what are we baking, Dad?

I am thinking a lemon loaf.

Lemon loaf? Yeah.

That's new.

Hey.

Morning. Did they arrive?

Yep, fresh off the farm.

You sure there's 200 in there?

Emily: Well, there better be.

The Stromwall retirement
party is in four weeks.

Barely enough time.

I know you mentioned there's
a code and everything,

but is anyone really
going to count?

They asked for 200
butterflies, they're paying

for 200 butterflies,
we will deliver them

200 butterflies. I know.

But this is going to be the
biggest release we've ever made.

We might need help.

I know.

And a new compressor.

Or we won't have any
butterflies to deliver.

Oh. It's them.

Them?

Hi! Hi!

You're sure we're not intruding?

Oh, no, not at all. Hi, Amanda.

Hi!

You made quite the
impression on this one.

She's about to start a...

I want to tell her, Daddy!

Sorry.

So I've been really interested
in butterflies since my party.

Her school is doing a
project on butter...

Daddy! Sorry.

So that's why I want to get
a tour of a butterfly farm.

Oh, well, you came
to the right spot.

Oh, um, this is Adam,
you met him at the party.

Hi. Garrett.

I remember.

Amanda is interested
in what we do.

Come on in, I'll
show you guys around.

So this is where we keep
all the eggs and larva.

It has to stay very clean

and the temperature
has to be regulated

so there's just the right
warmth and humidity.

This is so cool.

Come with me.

First things first,
very important,

we need to clean our hands.

And then we go into what
we call the Flight House.

That's where we keep...

All the butterflies.

That's right.

So this is what we like to
call our butterfly sanctuary

instead of a farm.

We raise a lot of butterflies
just to set them free.

Like a butterfly rescue.

In a way, yes.

Did you know Monarchs can
fly all the way to Mexico?

I did know that.

And that some flowers
wouldn't survive

if butterflies didn't
pollenate them?

Emily: That's right.

And that growing milkweed and
other plants is really good

because a lot of their
habitat is being destroyed.

Wow, you have done
your homework!

Oh, you have no idea.

Well, then you can see that
this isn't just a business.

We're also helping
the planet, too.

And they're really pretty.

They are really
pretty, aren't they?

You're really pretty.

My dad thinks so.

I heard him talking to
his friend on the phone.

Garrett: Uh, Amanda.

I, uh, I don't know what
she thought she heard

on the phone.

You don't think
she's pretty, Daddy?

Yes, I do.

Told you.

Thank you.

Emily, a word?

Yeah.

Bingo.

Oh, stop it! It
doesn't mean anything.

You're worse than the kid.

So this, obviously, is
where the butterfly emerges

from the chrysalis.

Different suppliers send
us our eggs and larva,

as you saw in the lab.

How long does it
take for a larva

to turn into a caterpillar?

Well, that depends
on the weather.

But from egg to butterfly,
usually about four weeks.

Yeah, three to five days for
the egg to turn to larva.

Which grow into caterpillars.

That's right. And about ten days

for the caterpillar to
turn into a chrysalis.

And about two weeks after
that, a butterfly comes out.

Very good!

I always used to just take
that stuff for granted,

but it's pretty amazing.

I like to think so, too.

I have an idea.

How would the two of you like
to help out at our next event?

Sure! Can we, Daddy?

If it's okay with you.

Yeah. Great idea.

Amanda: Awesome!

Oh!

Excuse me.

Hello, this is Emily.

Oh please, like Rebecca
O'Keefe would be calling me.

Wait, this is really
Rebecca O'Keefe?

Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

You'd like to meet?! When?

Sure! Wait.

Wait, how many?

Okay. I'll see you then.

That was Rebecca O'Keefe.

Rebecca O'Keefe as in
the socialite heiress

to the O'Keefe
publishing empire?

Yep, that Rebecca O'Keefe.

Who is getting married
in a few weeks?

It's all over the tabloids.

I guess I missed it.

It's only going to be
the most talked about

wedding of the year.

She wants us to release 500
butterflies at her wedding.

500 butterflies?

500 butterflies.

We're going to raise and
release 500 butterflies.

Mm-hm.

When is the wedding
again? Three weeks.

My gosh.

As you can see I don't
have a wedding planner.

I don't trust them.

I'll be making all the decisions

so you'll be dealing
directly with me.

Despite what's in the media,

it's going to be
an intimate wedding

with only a few
family and friends.

Great, I just need to know...

Naturally, I'll
be wearing white,

and all the ladies attending
will be wearing off white.

I don't want anyone
to hijack the floral.

I really want the
flowers to pop.

Got it.

Is this... too light
for my complexion?

Personally I would go
with a deeper colour.

Agreed. Do the
Monarchs come in blue?

No, they're orange
with black and white.

Fine. What's the best
compliment to the color orange?

Well, purple, but then
I wouldn't go as dark.

Lavender is a nice colour,
and lavender smells great.

I'm a conservationist, you know.

I heard.

So you can do it?

Yes, 500 butterflies will be
a challenge but we're on it.

I think you misunderstood.
I said at least 500.

Whoever can deliver
the most gets the job.

Whoever?

Yeah, it's between you and,
um, what's her name? Fischer?

Mandy Fischer.

I've given her the
same opportunity.

She said it would be
no challenge at all.

I'm not surprised. But honestly,

this many butterflies has
never been done before.

So you can't do it?

Nope, I'm the one
who will do it.

Great. It will be
well worth your while,

and not just the money,
but the publicity.

Tah.

Tah.

Adam: Mandy Fischer?!

Doesn't she know she'll
short her by half?

Or use Viceroys
instead of Monarchs?

Rebecca O'Keefe will
never know the difference.

I can't believe
you agreed to this.

How was I supposed to say no?

Rebecca O'Keefe is on the
cover of every magazine,

which means this event will be
on the cover of every magazine.

This little business of
ours could hit the big time.

It'll hit something else if we
can't deliver 500 butterflies.

At least 500.

I'm not about to let Mandy
Fischer steal this one from me.

Don't make it personal.

I do this because
I love butterflies

and how they are
connected to our world.

Mandy's only in
it for the money.

Fair enough. But this is
going to be no easy task.

I know. We're going to have
to expand our flight house.

And we'll need new suppliers.

And we'll need to buy
caterpillars, not eggs,

or there won't be
enough time. Agreed.

I already have calls
into Taylor Brothers

and Margallo Farms in Spokane.

Good. Taylor's a friend of
mine, he'll prioritize for us.

Well, we just need to
beat Mandy to them.

Timing is everything.

The eggs can't hatch a minute
too soon or a minute to late.

And we still have the Stromwall
retirement party coming up.

Oh my gosh, you're right.
Okay, all hands on deck.

Speaking of which,
I'm running late.

Need help with this one?

No, it's small.
Another show and tell.

Besides, Garrett and Amanda
will be there. Remember?

Right. How could I forget.

Mm-hm, yeah. Nice
one, by the way.

See ya.

I want to hear every detail.

Mm-hm.

Hi!

Sorry, a million things
happening at once today.

That's okay, how can we help?

Uh, well, looks like
the birthday boy's mom

has the decorations set up,

so we just need
the show and tell

and the butterflies.

All right.

You can hold him if you want.

Just let him crawl
onto your hand.

It's okay if it flies away.

That's what we want him to do.

Whoa! Cool!

Kids, parents, do
you want to come over

and look at the show and tell?

Coffee? You're a godsend.

Thank you.

Hey, Amanda,

do you want to take over by
yourself for a little bit?

I'm on it.

We're just going
to be over here.

Amanda: Okay.

Well, I think she knows more
about butterflies than I do.

Yeah, sorry, when she gets
excited about something,

there's no stopping her.

So, uh, how long have you been
doing this butterfly thing?

Four years. Yeah. It
started out as a hobby,

kind of a weekend
thing, and a year later,

I was able to quit my day job.

Mm, and what was
that, if I may ask?

You may. Nothing special, at
least it didn't feel special.

Corporate desk job. Data
analyst and miserable.

Oh no, don't tell me
you're a data analyst.

Hmm? No.

What do you do for a
living, if I may ask?

You may.

Um, it's a bit weird, but

nothing, if I don't want to.

What, did you win the
lottery or something?

No. My grandfather did.

He bet right on
the stock market.

Now my father runs one of the
largest hedge funds in New York.

Wow. So what brought
you out here?

Well, just after
Amanda was born,

her mother passed away.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

Amanda never really
knew her, sadly.

And then after a bit of time, I
got into another relationship,

we followed her up here.

Ultimately things
didn't really work out.

So now my father wants me
to come back to New York

and take over the family reigns.

Well, you don't sound
very excited about that.

You know, I like
working with my hands.

Working on something tangible.

I don't want to work
on a ledger all day,

if you know what I mean.

Besides, you have to wear
a tie. I'm not a tie guy.

No?

No.

Well, you do know that there's
a living in fixing things?

Yes, just...

It's just hard to pay for a
big school in New York City.

So you're moving
to New York, then?

Yeah, looks like it.

How soon?

I dunno, a couple weeks, maybe.

It just depends on a
few other things, but

it's complicated.

So what kinds of things
are you good at fixing?

Oh, well, you name it.

Mechanical?

That's my specialty.

Really? Yeah.

All right, well, if
you're interested,

I might have some work
for you before you go.

Great!

Sorry, I just...

Hey, Jill. Yeah.

No, I'm just at a birthday
party with Amanda.

No, not her birthday party.

She had hers last week.
You know that, come on.

Okay, look, why don't we just...

We'll talk about it
when you get here, okay?

Yeah.

So tell me about him.

Tell you about who?

I told you. A
father always knows.

And I can tell that there's
something that has changed

inside of you.

There's a light.

And a bit of melancholy, too.

You are good. I'll
give you that.

Well, you'll have the same
intuition when you have a kid

and I'm a grandfather.

Is that too much to ask?

Dad... I'm sorry.

I'm sorry if the pain
still sears a bit.

It shouldn't.

I love my life, Dad.

I have a great
business, great friends.

I don't need a guy
to complete me.

If you say so.

How am I supposed to
know when I'm ready?

Nobody ever knows
if they're ready.

So I'm right, aren't I?

You met a guy.

I thought I did.

Tell me about him.

It's the first time I've
felt anything since Randy.

That's terrific.

No, not so terrific. I
think he has a girlfriend,

and he might be moving to
New York in a few weeks.

Oh.

Well, at least you're still
open to those kind of feelings.

Well, I don't know how to
trust those feelings, Dad.

I thought I was in
love with Randy, and...

You were in love with Randy.

You were brave.

He's the one who didn't
have the courage to commit.

But I got it wrong. No.

You did not get it wrong.

In life, we try all
kinds of things.

The only time we get it
wrong is when we don't try.

So what's his name?

His name is Garrett.

We hosted his daughter's
birthday party.

There's just that... you know.

Chemistry.

Yeah.

Now, are you sure about
the girlfriend thing?

Pretty sure.

And lest we forget,
he might be moving.

There's that, too.

Let me tell you
something, sweetie.

If it's meant to be,

he's not going anywhere.

Okay, I'll said is that
I kind of like him.

I didn't say anything
about it being meant to be.

Well, listen, even if
he is not Mr. Right,

at least you're open to the idea

that Mr. Right is
out there somewhere.

That's what worries me.

You are so beautiful, Emily.

Inside and out.

And besides, you can't stay
hidden in your cocoon forever.

My cocoon?

Okay. Give it a try.

Your bearings were burnt out.

That's why it was reading
the wrong temperature.

I don't know how to thank you.

Just give me
something else to do.

Are you kidding? We're
just getting started.

Um, will these work?

Perfect, come with me.

So, we'll lay them into
each of these habitats,

and we'll lean them
against the sides.

We just want some place for
the butterflies to perch

once they emerge. Got it.

But we can do that after,
we'd better get going.

Mm-hm. Where are we going?

To the woods!

What's in the woods?

Milkweed for the Monarchs.
Cheaper than buying it.

At the stem. Thp.

Keep the leaves whole,
Monarchs eat a lot.

Uh... It's my Dad.

He's just excited
about us coming back?

Well, can you tell him
that you'll still be around

for this wedding?

I'm going to need all
the help I can get.

Maybe if I don't mention
the word "wedding."

He still has high hopes for me.

Oh, don't let him meet my dad.

If it were up to him,
forget speed dating,

it would be speed marriage.

Any prospects?

It's a long story.

You know, honestly,
I think my Dad

he's just thinking about Amanda.

He wants her to have a
mother figure in her life.

Can't say that I blame him.

Any prospects?

It's complicated.

Well, I like to think that
the world works things out

the way that
they're meant to be.

I like to think that, too.

I was going to tell you,

I'm picking up a few
new pop-ups later,

and I thought Amanda
might want one.

Raise a few butterflies herself.

She'd love one!

I'll stop by your
house on my way back.

Great. Well, hey, thank you.

Emily: Well, would
you look at that?

You want me to try to
steal the net from Amanda?

That's a Mariposa.

A Mariposa?

Spanish for butterfly.

That's your last name.

Funny how the world
works things out.

Hi. Hi!

Is this a good time?

It is if you want to eat.

No, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

No, come on. Come, come.

And thanks for bringing
the pop-up for Amanda.

She doesn't get excited
about a lot of things,

there's not a lot of
friends, but with your help,

she's starting to
emerge, shall we say?

Come on.

Uh, okay.

That was delicious.

Don't try his meatloaf.

Hey.

So what's next for
this little one?

For starters, we need to double
the size of our Flight House.

I can get the permits,

but I need to find
someone who can build it.

Pronto. I'm your man.

I hope so.

Are you sure? We're
in a bit of a rush.

I'll tell you what, I'll
clear my busy schedule.

Well, thank you. We'll
start planning it tomorrow.

Oh, excuse me.

Thanks for the pop-up,
I'm so excited.

Aw, you are so welcome.
You're the best assistant.

Surprise!

Jill? I thought you weren't
coming until next week.

I was able to
change my schedule.

I wasn't expecting you.

I missed you. Uh, I...

Jill: Where's Amanda?

Garrett: Oh, she's...
she's in there.

Jill!

Hey, sweetie. Come here.

I want to show you this
really cool pop-up.

First, I got this beautiful
gift all the way from Portugal.

It's called a balance necklace.

It's a reminder that
the perfect life

is built on the goal of balance.

And it's a reminder
that you are loved.

Don't you think it's pretty?

Yeah, it just... sparkles.

Um, who is this?

This is Emily. Emily is...

Just leaving. Nice to meet you.

Jill: It was nice
to meet you, too.

Um, excuse me for a minute.

Emily, wait, I can explain.

It's none of my business.

She's... It's fine.

I'll talk to you tomorrow,
and thanks again for dinner.

Where are we meeting her?

18th hole.

Rebecca: You're not listening!

The putter! It's
literally right there!

You're not... I don't want that!

No! That one below.

Is that her?

That's her.

Okay.

Man: Fore!

Obviously the best
place to have my wedding

is the O'Keefe golf course.

My great-grandfather
built it in 1933.

The sun will be there, no
longer in anyone's eyes.

Mandy: So smart.

This is where the vows will be.

Wow, it's pretty here.

Yeah, I like to keep
it conservation-y.

The vows will take 17 minutes.

I want the butterflies
to be released

exactly when we
kiss behind us here.

Not a problem at all.

And you'll need some
kind of barrier.

Why?

Well, you don't want your
guests looking at me.

And it's supposed to
feel like the butterflies

have sprung from nature.

Well, what kind of barrier?

Shrubbery, and a few trees.

How is a tree going to grow
in time for the wedding?

No, we can bring something in.

We do it all the time.
A simple hedge will do.

Actually, I can decorate...

Mandy: You know, my
team can decorate

to match all of the flowers,
and all of the colours.

Mandy, that's a terrific idea.

Mandy: Thank you.

So how many butterflies
can I expect?

At least 500, guaranteed.

I can get you 600.
I can get you 1,000.

That's impossible,
and you know it.

I don't believe in impossible.

God never said it was impossible
to create the butterfly,

and he did, so...

You'll both have to let
me know the day before

and I'll make my decision.

They day before?

Is that a problem?

Well...

It's just that I'll be investing
a lot of time and money, and...

See, that's not my problem.
You're free to bow out.

Now this is very important.

I want the butterflies to
circle over the two of us

before they fly away.

It doesn't really
work like that.

Well, can't
butterflies be trained?

No. You know what?

I'm gonna look into
a butterfly wrangler

and get right back
to you on that.

Oh, come on!

See, Emily? Can you at least
try before you dismiss the idea?

Yeah, Emily, can you just try?

I've been wanting to
expand for a while.

This is great.

Well, this is our
expansion project?

Son of a bee sting!
Are you okay?

Let me see. Let me see.

I think we're done for today.

There you go. Don't
worry, it's decaf.

Ow! Oh...

How's the thumb?

It... I'll live.

I just hope it doesn't
detract from a job well done.

Are you kidding? This
is going to be amazing.

Beyond just our business,

this will be a real
butterfly sanctuary.

Well, it was always my dream
to save the butterflies.

So, um...

When will the
caterpillars be ready?

Three days.

And what's the word
on Mandy Fischer?

Well, she's been after
the same vendors.

But inside sources tell me

that she doesn't have
the same numbers.

You know, is it... Is
it really worth all this

if Rebecca just ends up
picking Mandy in the end?

Okay, well, A, I'm not going
to lose to Mandy Fischer.

Wait, sorry, what...

What is your deal with her?

It seems like it's
just a business to her.

She does kitten
parties, puppies too.

Butterflies are just a number.

And I have a connection
to butterflies

and their place in this world.

And I like to teach people
the importance of that.

Okay, so don't lose
to Mandy Fischer.

And B?

B...

Yes, it's been worth it.

Yeah, it has.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I don't get it.

I feel like there's this

this thing here.

There's a thing?

Well, us.

There, that look?

That's not how someone
typically looks at me,

and that's not how,
typically, I look at someone.

Yeah, me either.

There, you... You
just did it again.

I'm sorry, I don't know
how I'm looking at you.

No, I don't want you
to be sorry, I just...

I don't get it.

Jill.

Yes. Jill.

I told you, it's complicated.

Well, I'm not
complicated, Garrett.

You either have a
girlfriend or you don't.

I don't.

You kissed her. She kissed me.

And you know, just
for the record,

she's not staying at my house.
Jill is my ex-girlfriend.

She's always been a big
part of Amanda's life.

We stayed friends, and
probably always be friends.

So what happened?

Well,

she works for the
state department,

and she was assigned overseas.

She was there for a few
months, and we just...

We kinda lost our way.

And what, she's found it again?

Yeah, yeah, she has.

She's stationed
back in New York.

Which is part of the reason
why my dad wants me to go back,

because he is all for
this reconciliation.

And you?

Jill and I have this
history. Amanda adores her,

she's a great role
model for Amanda.

I think Jill is curious to see

if there's something
still there.

Is there?

I don't know.

And you know, I think
that's what's bothering me,

because I feel like I should.

It's a lame answer,
I know. I'm sorry.

No, it's an honest answer.

Honestly, yeah, I
wanted to give it a try.

Until...

Until what?

Until the unexpected.

And, um... you know,

I realize that Jill and I

weren't always compatible.

She doesn't really appreciate
a guy who gets his hands dirty.

You know what's funny
is my grandfather,

he wasn't a businessman.

He just got lucky
on some stocks.

But before that,
he was a carpenter.

He could build
anything, fix anything,

that was his trade.

It was until the
day that he died.

It's in your blood.

Well, it might skip a generation

but it's in there.

Did you know that
the Monarch butterfly

migrates down to
Mexico each year?

That's where they
lay their eggs,

and then they migrate back here.

The entire cycle takes three
generations, sometimes five.

I didn't know that.

Each generation relies on
the next to carry its legacy.

What a day.

I got in the three
orders we needed.

I'm calling two other
places tomorrow.

If Taylor Brothers
comes through,

we should be covered.

Only thing I'm worried
about is the timing.

You didn't hear a word I said.

Sorry.

What's going on?

It's what I thought.

Ex-girlfriend.

Long history. Back
in the picture.

Get out.

I don't get it.

The guy has a
total crush on you.

It's complicated.

Please.

No, by definition, it's true.

He doesn't know what he wants.

That's because he's a guy.

No, it's because he's confused.

So un-confuse him.

I don't even know what I want.

Maybe I'm just feeling
stupidly rejected.

I hardly know him.

Well, how do you feel
when you're around him?

Like I have butterflies
in my stomach.

Adam: Then don't let
him flutter away.

See you tomorrow.

You're the best, Adam.

Working on it.

Morning!

Morning.

Still like it with
cream and cinnamon?

Garrett: Yeah, that's perfect.

See, it's like we've
hardly been apart.

Hardly.

Have you started packing?

I've been a little busy.

Doing what?

Well, you know, I work
for a living here, Jill.

But it's more of a
hobby, though, isn't it?

Your father is going to set
you up with a real career.

What's going on?

This is not fair.

It's not fair that you
just come back into my life

like it hasn't been two years.
Like I haven't moved on.

It's not like we haven't seen
each other in those two years.

You're right.

The butterfly lady?

How long has that been going on?

No, nothing is going
on. I hardly know her.

Well then let's not throw away
all the time we had together.

We had something really special.

Had, Jill.

We had something really
special. That's the key word.

I have some news.

I spoke to Amy Pritchard
at Breck Academy,

my alma mater, and sent in
an application for Amanda.

What?

I know I should have asked,

but I didn't want you to say no.

No, you should have
discussed this with me.

I wanted it to be a surprise.

It's the best school
in New York, Garrett.

All the money in the
world can't get you in.

It's gonna take all the money
in the world to pay for it!

Which is why taking over
your father's company

is so important.
Think about Amanda,

and what this would
mean for her future.

Daddy! Look!

I found a caterpillar from
the pop-up that Emily gave me!

That's great!

Do you want to come
and see it too, Jill?

Sure, sweetie. Let's see.

Wow! That is so cool!

Thanks! I'm so proud of you.

Amanda: Thank you.
Jill: Come here.

Aww.

Listen, I've gotta run,
but we'll talk later, okay?

Okay.

Bye, sweetie.

Bye, Jill.

Hey! Looking good.

I'll clean all this
up later, you know,

I'll put down some sod.
How are the orders coming?

We're all set. Just a
matter of logistics now.

I think we're actually
going to pull this off.

Eat your heart
out, Mandy Fischer.

Hey, you've got
something on your...

Just up on your...

On my face?

Up here?

Yeah. A little bit down.

Just like, here? I...

Here, I'll... Oh yeah?

Let me help you. No, no, no, no!

Why not?

I'm just helping you! Don't!

Don't you dare.

Okay, okay. Fine.

Peace.

Oh!

Okay, now I'm...

Oh no! Are you okay?

Okay, I surrender. I surrender.

White flag.

Emily: No...

That's not a new shirt, is it?

Oh, I'm gonna get you.

Oh yeah? Yeah.

If you can catch me!

You better run!

Hey, you've got
something on your face.

Look at that. It's a dragon.

You can see the head and
the tail and the wings.

That's an elephant.

Oh yeah. It's an elephant.

That one right there?

A butterfly.

Everything is a
butterfly with you.

Any decisions yet?

I just have to think
what's best for Amanda.

Whatever makes her happy.

I don't even think she
knows what makes her happy.

Do you?

Whoa.

What?

Adam: Nothing, you look great.

This is bound to turn his head.

Oh please, this is not an
attempt to change his mind.

Will you just tell him
how you feel already?

Yeah, that would be
a little obvious.

At least you'll know.

What?

He's not supposed to come
until this afternoon.

Rebecca.

I've called you three
times. We need to talk.

Emily: Uh, well, I
didn't get any messages.

Mandy Fischer answers
on the first ring.

You must be Adam.

I am, nice to meet you.

We have a problem. What problem?

Christi Cameron.

I'm not following.

Best friend. Was best friend.

She released 1,500
butterflies at a charity event

in New York last week.

Mandy Fischer says
she can deliver 1,501.

But I get the impression
Mandy Fischer just says

whatever I want to hear.

I will not let Christi
Cameron best me.

Can you do it? Say yes
now and the job is yours.

Yes.

Uh, all we can promise is
our best effort, Rebecca.

I know two vendors that
might be able to help,

but it's a long shot, so...

But that's a yes, right?

You'll be on the cover
of Wedding Weekly.

Okay, yes.

I knew it. And
don't forget, 1,501.

You look really nice
today, by the way.

Thank you.

Remind me to set you up
with someone at the wedding.

Congratulations!

You know I'm not out
of the woods yet.

You know, I could... I could go
get the caterpillars for you.

Thank you.

Thank you, but I...
I have to do it.

I need to inspect them and
make sure the count is right.

Well, how are you planning on
being in two places at once?

Magic. An act of God? I...

I haven't figured it out yet.

You know, um, Amanda and I,

we could do one of the parties.

I hadn't thought of that.

Well, Adam is doing
the retirement party,

and the other one is a birthday
party, just a small one?

A couple dozen butterflies?
We could handle that.

Are you sure? Absolutely.

I mean, Amanda's been
trained by the best, right?

Thank you. Thanks.

Okay. Sure!

What am I going
to do without you?

I just mean, after this,

we're going to hit the big time,

and, well, you'll be missed.

Will I?

Hi, Emily, how are you?

Panicked as usual,
Taylor. Thank you.

I wanted to tell you,

there's a clean survival
rate on the larva.

This is a good crop
of caterpillars.

Great. What ratio do
you think we can expect?

80-20.

That'll do!

However, the OE has
begun to spread again.

A nasty little parasite
wiping out a lot of Monarchs.

But it hasn't reached
this far yet, has it?

All it takes is one bad apple.

That's why we're
shutting down for a week.

Be extra careful.

We will.

Come on, I've got four
crates waiting for you.

Let's get them loaded up.

Thanks, Taylor.

Hey! How'd it go? It went great!

All of the butterflies flew
away like they were supposed to,

and one even landed on
one of the kids' noses.

Really?!

Oh, well, I'm glad to hear.

Yeah, I was hardly needed.

I'm not surprised.

The girl's mother already texted
me and said you both were great.

And thank you for the
updates, it eased my mind.

How'd it go? Well...

They're all here.

Amanda, do you want to help me

set the caterpillars
into their new homes?

Yeah. Okay.

You take this one,
I'll follow you in.

Why don't you guys get
started? I'll grab the rest.

Thanks.

What are you doing?

This is my friend.

Oh! Does your
friend have a name?

Sarah.

That's a pretty name. How
did you come up with that?

Well, my mom's name was Sarah.

Oh.

I found her in the woods,

that's why she's in
this little habitat.

Daddy said that Mommy
loved butterflies.

Really?

Yeah, I guess that's
why I like them so much.

I'm sure that's why.

You know, I'm kinda sad that
she's not here to help us.

I think that she really
would have liked it.

Well, you know what I believe?

I believe that she's
here right now.

Just in ways that we can't see.

You mean like an angel? Mm-hm.

Do you think it's
possible for humans

to grow wings when
they go to heaven?

Well, I don't know if
they grow wings exactly,

but we have to
get there somehow.

Do you think a caterpillar
knows that one day,

it will grow wings and fly?

That would seem pretty
impossible, wouldn't it?

I guess so.

Well, this world we're in,

we think it's so
big and amazing.

Just like a caterpillar sees it.

But then it changes
into something

so beautiful and wondrous

that it can't even imagine
the way it was before.

Yeah.

Trust me.

Your mom is watching over you.

And she must be very proud.

And I'll tell you what.

We'll keep a special
eye on Sarah here,

and when she decides
it's her time,

we can watch her
fly away together.

Deal? Deal.

Okay.

So why don't you do
this the day before?

You know you're going to have
to water these every day.

Rebecca insisted. She
leaves nothing to chance.

She even got flowers that will
bloom in exactly seven days,

eight hours, and 47 minutes,

just as they're
saying their vows.

You're kidding.

I kid not.

Well then, you better
hope 1,500 butterflies

show themselves to the world
when they're supposed to.

1,501.

Well, that's
looking pretty good.

We'll never be able to see
the man behind the curtain.

Thanks for helping.
Can I buy you lunch?

Well, a wise man once said,

never turn down a free lunch.

So what do you think?

Gourmet burgers in
a place like this?

How can you beat it?

I don't think you can.

How'd you find this
place, anyways?

I got engaged here.

You're engaged?

Up until a year ago.

But this is where he proposed.

Do you mind if I
ask what happened?

We were together
for a few years,

and happy, I thought.

He proposed, I said yes, and...

He changed his mind.

I'm sorry.

I'm surprised I didn't think of
that before I brought you here.

Maybe that's because it
just doesn't matter anymore.

That's why you didn't
think about it.

So it doesn't have
to take away from

from all of this.

Yeah. You're right.

You know, I feel like
I'm seeing this place

in a whole new light.

Great.

What? Who is it?

Oh, that's my Dad's car.

What, it's a bad thing?

No, I love my Dad, but
sometimes he has no boundaries.

He's taking a baking class,

and he just shows up
assuming I want to bake.

Baking class? Yeah.

Apparently a great spot
to meet women his age.

Would you come in and meet him,

or else I'll never
hear the end of it.

I don't want to intrude.

Especially during baking time.

Trust me, it will
be another favour.

Hello.

You didn't answer
your text messages.

Uh, my phone died.

Nonsense.

What are we into for today, Dad?

Cookies.

Chocolate marble.

Sounds great. Dad, this is...

So this is him.

Garrett. Nice to
finally meet you.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Mar...

Larry. Call me Larry.

Larry.

I can see why you have
such a crush on him.

Dad!

Yeah, she talks about
you all the time.

She goes on and on about you.

She does? Yeah.

No, really, I haven't.

Did she tell you that
her fiancÃ© left her

standing at the altar last year?

No. Dad!

Listen, that saying,
"Once bitten, twice shy?"

Thrice, is that a word?
'Cause if it is, it's her.

Okay, stop. Now.

Oh, she thinks I'm
embarrassing her.

You are embarrassing me!

Don't you think she's
absolutely lovely?

I do.

You do?

Then why haven't
you told her yet?

It's complicated. Oh,
yes, so I've heard.

Dad, your cookies are burning!

Nice try. They're
not in the oven yet.

Listen, things are only
complicated until they're not.

Oh, excuse me.

Phone snakes! Play nice.

I've got all kinds of
stories that I can tell you

about my little baby.

Hello?

Emily, we're in
trouble. Get here now.

Yeah, I'll be right there.

We've gotta go.

We lost almost half
the caterpillars.

What?

Have a look. I put
one under the scope.

What? OE.

OE. Ophryocystis elektroscirrha.

It's a parasite that
infects Monarchs.

Do you see how dark it is?

Yeah. How did that happen?

Pesticides on milkweed is
the most common reason.

Farmers are using it to control
the spread of the gypsy moth.

Which means other rhopalocera
get caught in the crossfire.

Butterflies.

Emily, I swear I washed
everything I brought in.

No, no, it's not your fault.

Some of the powders
and sprays they use now

are impossible to get out.

Or an infected
insect got in here.

Taylor warned me that
there was an outbreak.

This happens all the
time in the wild.

Millions of butterflies
every single year.

Between them and our bee
population dying off,

our entire ecosystem
is in jeopardy.

So what do we do?

First, we need to isolate
the surviving caterpillars

for the next few days.

And we need to look for
some milkweed in the wild.

We can't take any more chances.

Emily, we have a bigger problem.

I know.

We're going to need at
least 700 more caterpillars.

How many do you have? 50?

No, it was OE. We're pretty
sure it's run its course.

Whatever you can give us.

Jared, it's Emily. Hi.

I know, it's awful. But
can you help us out?

I'll call them. Thank you.

Farmer: Here's what I can spare.

Thanks, I really
appreciate this.

Farmer: Hope it's enough.

Take care!

Is this all you have?

Farmer: Yeah, this is all of it.

Thank you. No problem.

How short are we?

Four hundred.

We're never going to find
another 400 caterpillars.

We've called everyone.

Not everyone.

This is going to be painful.

You've got to be joking.

So let me get this straight.
Now you want my help,

after you've swooped in
and stole the job from me.

I didn't steal it. She chose me.

Mm-hm, after you
convinced her to.

Well, duh. Ladies.

Maybe we should just stick
to the subject at hand?

Do you have 400 caterpillars?

Well, obviously I do,

if I was prepared to give 1,500.

Well, I know that's what
you told Rebecca, but...

Okay. Fine.

I wouldn't have come close.

I don't even have 400.

Well, we'll take
whatever you have.

I'm not just going
to sell them to you.

What, so you get all the
press and all the glory?

I don't want to buy them.

I'm not just going
to give them to you.

I can't believe I'm
saying this, but

let's team up together.

I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, what?

We can do this together.

Let's make this event one
no one will ever forget.

Are you being serious?

Yes.

Well, I don't know what to say.

To a new partnership?

Uh... If...

If what?

If you promise to learn
more about butterflies.

Why they're so special,
what they do for our world,

and why what we do
is so important.

I want you to love
them as much as I do.

I do love butterflies.

I might not know as much as you
about the science of everything.

Okay, I don't know
anything about the science.

But that doesn't matter,

because I've always
loved butterflies.

My mom was a fabulous gardener.

And she had a big garden.

My mom had a nice garden, too.

And one of my earliest
childhood memories

was running through
the garden and...

Chasing the butterflies.

Well.

All right.

Oh, there's just one problem.

We're going to be about a
hundred caterpillars short.

I guess we'll have to
find the rest in the wild.

Um, that's kind of a lot
to pick from random leaves.

Wait, I... I think
I have an idea.

My daughter is doing a school
project on butterflies.

They found a bunch of
milkweed around the school.

I could talk to the
teacher and see if maybe

she could recruit a few
of the students for a, uh,

"special assignment."

That's a great idea.

Well, cheers.

You finally came to your senses.

By the way, um, are
you still single?

Uh, it's complicated.

Does anyone know what kind of
animal a butterfly is? Yes.

An insect! And there are
20,000 different species.

Emily: Very good!

Yes?

Are you a professor?

Now, I'm a lepidopterologist.

What's a lepi-dop-a-gee?

Someone who studies butterflies.

That's right. And who can
tell me what a butterfly eats?

Nectar. Sorry.

That's right.
Butterflies eat nectar,

and why is that so important?

Because that's how butterflies
pollenate flowers and plants.

You told me to get
more interested.

Now how many of you can tell me,

besides our friend Mandy here,

what type of
caterpillar this is?

Is it a Monarch?

It is a Monarch, and how
would all of you like to go

looking for Monarch caterpillars
on a scavenger hunt?!

Okay, whoever finds
the most caterpillars

gets a home butterfly kit.

Everybody follow me.

Mandy: All right,
children. Let's go get 'em!

Good job, kids!

Be careful! Oh, don't squish it.

You go!

Get 'em!

Want a caterpillar?

Uh, no thank you.

One of the moms just
dropped this off.

Emily: Oh, great!

Let's keep them separated
until we know they're healthy.

Should we feel bad about
taking these from the wild?

I mean, picture it this way.

Half of them would have been
eaten. Nature's not kind.

Nice. It's true.

They'll be back in
the wild soon enough.

Well, how long will this take?

If we're lucky, about two weeks.

What do we do now?

We wait. And hope.

And pray.

Hi, Jill.

Yeah, uh, just one second.

Hi.

Great news. I just
spoke to Amy at Breck,

and Amanda has been accepted!

She has?

Yes! I'm so excited, and
your father is thrilled.

You told him? Jill:
Of course. I told you.

People can't buy their way
into this school, Garrett.

This is a pretty big deal.

No, yeah, no... it's...

It's a big deal.

It's terrific. Thank you, Jill.

Hey.

Hey.

You okay?

Yeah.

Then why don't you seem like it?

We're moving to
New York next week.

Oh.

This doesn't come
without mixed emotions.

I just, I have to
think about Amanda.

You know, I have to
put her needs first.

Amanda will be happy
wherever she is,

as long as she's with you.

It's a good school she got in.
You know, it's one of the best.

And she's got all the
history with Jill...

It's the right decision.

You sure?

Yeah.

Listen, I won't be able to
be there for the wedding.

But I'd like to help out,

do anything I can
before I leave.

I'd like that.

Daddy, look!

I see it!

I named her after Mommy.

I remember.

Sarah the butterfly.

Amanda: Yeah.

No matter how many
times I see it,

it's still a wonder.

I can't believe we
pulled this off.

Mandy: I can't either.

That was insane,
and this is lovely.

To our new friendship.

And partnership.

Really? After everything?

Why not?

You are like the perfect person.

It's so annoying.

I'll drink to that.

Well, here's to
1,501 butterflies.

Cheers! Cheers!

I couldn't have done
this without you guys.

Well, don't forget me.

I mean, you couldn't
have done it without me

and my amazing skills
with a hammer and nails.

Yeah, you mean the one
that bashed your thumb?

Ouch.

Seriously, though.
This was a lot of fun,

so thank you for
including Amanda, and me.

Thank you.

You are so welcome sweetie.

You come back and
visit me anytime, okay?

I will. I'll miss you.

Larry: You've gotta try
one of these burgers.

Oh, um, I'm... I'm stuffed.

Nonsense. I'm taking
a grilling class.

The cheese on the
inside of the burgers,

it melted when I
charbroiled them.

They're fantastic.

Uh, I'll take two. Ah!

Don't encourage him.

There you are, good man.

Oh, um... Our car is here.

What happened to your SUV?

I sold it.

This all happened
so fast. Safe trip.

Thanks.

Bye, Garrett.

See you.

Larry, how about I
try those burgers

next time I'm back in town?

You do that.

You take care, son.

Garrett: Thanks. You too.

I'll walk you guys out.

Well, good luck at the wedding.

Thank you.

You know, I really wish
that I could be there.

I get it.

I'm really gonna miss you.

I'll miss you too, sweetheart.

Well, take care of yourself.

Yeah. You too.

You okay?

I'm fine.

I feel... I feel bad about this.

I just feel like
the timing was off.

Don't feel bad.

And the timing was really good.

I feel great.

And I haven't felt great in
a really long while, so...

Well, I'm happy to hear that.

You know, I, uh...

I kinda wish Amanda was
born a month earlier.

That way we could have spent
a bit more time together.

That would have been May 10th?

Nah, we were booked up that day.

Well, I guess we never
would have met, then.

It's funny how the
world works things out.

Yeah.

Hello? Oh.

Sweetie, don't you think it's
time that we let Sarah go?

Not yet! Emily said I
could keep her for a week.

Well, why don't you bring
her and your suitcase

over to the car? I'll
meet you over there.

Okay.

Is that everything?

Yeah.

It's funny, I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

We'll have it shipped.

Come on, we're gonna
miss the flight.

So I got an interesting call.

Oh yeah? About what?

Well, the Bureau
Chief in Barcelona.

I'm not taking it, of course,
but it was interesting.

From this moment forward,

you will never be alone.

You will carry with you
the love of another person

giving you a completeness
and renewed likeness.

May your life together
be immersed in love...

How much longer?

Well, according to Rebecca's
itinerary, 18 seconds.

You have given and
received a ring

as a symbol of your
promises. By the power...

Okay, everybody. Get ready.

Okay, now.

Okay, now!

Pastor: I pronounce
you husband and wife.

Family and friends,
over 1,500 butterflies

released into the wild.

You okay?

Yeah. We did it.

That's not what I meant.

Honestly, I've
never felt better.

How about now?

What?

Emily!

Amanda!

We forgot we have to let
her go with the others.

Oh my gosh, you're
right! She's our 1,501.

What are you...

We had a record to
break, didn't we?

Okay, sweetie, time
to let Sarah go.

Well, congratulations
on the record.

Hi.

Hi.

What happened?

Amanda's heart is here.

And I realized that mine is too.

So you're staying?

Well, I mean, somebody has
to expand that Flight House

now that you've
hit the big time.

And I want to be with you.

Funny how the world
works things out.

Well, I guess it's not
so complicated after all.
