Will you marry me?

What?

Don't you want to?

I don't know.

I mean,
I can't say right now.

-Are you sure?
-Yes... aren't we?

It's just that, Jorge you can't
do that out of the blue!

You're right.
I don't know what I was...

I...

Carry on reading.

I will, this book's a best-seller.
It's really good.

I know, once you've started
you can't stop.

How about the mall on Saturday?
I asked Miguel for the car.

You could think over
the marriage thing.

OK, we could eat there

and spend the afternoon
in the shopping center.

FOOTBALL DAYS

When I started therapy here
I felt a bit strange.

This has completely changed me.

Now I feel I am a completely
new man and that...

Well, I've evolved.

Right, M Carmen?

And I feel I can face anything.

I control my impulses,

and...

Can I go to the ward?

I am talking.

I am talking, M Carmen.

I'm about to get the shakes.

I said I'm talking.

Breathe Antonio. You were doing
so well. Come on, breathe.

Can you see the light?
That's it. Can you see the light?

Tough shit!

M Carmen,
this ruins the therapy.

OK.

Yeah. Sorry.

Don't turn the pages so quickly.
I'm getting cold.

Ramón...

I'm pregnant.

<i>Welcome to the</i>
<i>"Oasis of Pleasure."</i>

<i>Plunge into the world</i>
<i>of wild sex and lust, with...</i>

Meatball, lunch is ready!

Study subject six,
I know it's going to come up.

No, for sure.
Talk to you later.

Coming, mum! I'm starving.
Be there in a minute!

Look!

That's me.

In my early days.

Did I tell you?
Next month I'm doing a movie!

Don't groan so loudly.

No, Pablo!

I want the Figo T-shirt!
I want the Figo T-shirt!

Hurry up, I've got to go
and get your uncle.

Great, so I'm the witch
and you're Father Christmas.

-No T-shirt, OK?
-No, sweetie, it's not...

Don't call me sweetie! And stop
staring at everyone’s tits!

Dad was staring at her tits!

No I wasn't!

We have a moral obligation

with Antonio. Otherwise...

We have to be there for him.
There he is!

Hey!

Antonio!

Jesus.

How's it going?

Are you out of your head?

Move, he'll kill the guy!

I apologize.

Please forgive me.

It was my fault.

"You talking to me?"

"You talking to me?"

Wow!

Yes sir!

-It gets better each time.
-I was nervous.

He even screwed the blonde
in the commercials with him!

No need for such detail.
Well yeah, I did screw her.

And he got a part in a movie.

-Change the subject.
-What movie is that?

-Well it's about...
-Antonio,

-we've got a job for you.
-I've made some arrangements.

You're coming on a bit heavy!

Jorge, I told you I didn't want
to talk about it like this.

It's a serious subject.

Look...

I've got my own project.

Your own project?

Yes, my own project.

I'm going to study psychology.

Psychology's
an interesting science.

Very interesting
and very necessary.

Look, you have to understand

that people suffer a lot
and they need help.

And since I'm a good listener...

I'll make a great psychologist
because that's what they do.

And give advice.

-You'll have to hold down a job.
-I know, Jorge.

The thing is I'm not going to study
like a seven-year degree thing.

I'm going to go it alone.

I'll do a correspondence course

and a few sessions on the side.
I don't need that university shit.

It's just one easy exam.

University's crap.

You know why I failed? I was
fucking his wife the whole time!

What was that
about my sister?

Let's order some prawns.
Evaristo!

Repeat what you said.

Antonio, please...

-Let it go.
-Shut up!

Look me in the eye and repeat
what you said about my sister!

You talking to me?

You talking to me?

It's the same old joke.

Patricia is a bit of a slut.

But Violeta's different.
How are things between you?

Watch what you say about my wife.

We'll say whatever
we fucking like about her.

We've all fucked her.
Him, him, him and all of us.

She only kissed Gonzalo,
and she was drunk.

-I touched her tits under the bra.
-You said it was over the bra.

I got nipple contact.

There you are.
Why do I bother?

Shit, I haven't
half missed you all.

Let's have a family photo.
That's it.

And another...

You'll use up all the film.

I don't know.

Oh, Antonio!

Pablito!

Come here,
I've got a present for you.

-So what should I do?
-Well just say no.

But I love him.

Jorge's a pain.
Always getting the shits.

-He was your boyfriend.
-Don't remind me.

Be smart, find yourself
a handsome, fun boyfriend.

I have a great time with Jorge.
And he's very handsome.

-He is not.
-Yes, he is.

He's got nice hair.

But look at those legs
and that fat belly.

It's a shame.

Miguel's certainly ugly.
Look at him.

He looks retarded
taking pictures of trees.

Ugly, boring

and completely retarded,
but Jorge...

-Well I love him.
-How could you?

I love him!

-How come you're so pale?
-I'm not!

-Are you eating alright?
-Just drop it!

Shit!

OK...

There's this guy at work

-and he's asked me out a few times.
-Have you fucked him?

No!

So?

Well, he gave me a kiss,
but no tongues.

No tongues? Are you 13 years old
or have you gone completely stupid?

Mum, look what Antonio's

given me!

As clumsy as his father.

Shit, Patricia, that's your son.

Keep an eye on the rice for me.

That smells good! I hope it's
crispy on the bottom how I like it.

It does smell good.
Miguel knows his paella.

No, I meant because
you were in charge.

Violeta, since we're talking I
wanted to bring up the other day...

Getting married and all that.

Oh, right.

Have you given it any thought?

Well, I have thought a bit
about it, but not much.

-My dad always knows what to do...
-Please, not your dad.

Don't give me that look.

My dad makes two lists:
one with advantages,

the other with disadvantages.
And he chooses the best solution.

I think the right thing
is to get married.

We have to start thinking about...
I'm not tying to pressure you.

That smells great.

Violeta, Jorge said we're going
to be a real family soon?

Then maybe you'll start thinking
about having kids...

This is to defend yourself, OK?

How about it?
Wouldn't you like a cousin?

Uncle Antonio says
Real Madrid fans are pussies.

What?

Don't teach the boy swearwords.

Real Madrid fans are machos.

Reel off Madrid's line-up
for your aunt and uncle.

Casillas, Salgado,



-Hierro...
-What are you doing?

Antonio...

So I can buy something
for the boys.

-You'll break parole.
-Give it back.

-The tall one...
-Antonio!

-OK, OK, sorry, sorry.
-Who was the tall one again?

Daddy!

-What are you doing?
-It fell.

You were stealing my purse!
You were stealing my purse!

I haven't stolen a thing!

What's wrong with you?
Think you're clever?

-Tell him to take it easy.
-I'm easy!

Calm down, sir,
I'm a policeman.

Hands off. Hands off.

That's it.
The man is a policeman.

That's it.
Everyone to their homes.

Solari, Raúl and Morientes.

You a cop?

I'll shove your truncheon
up your ass!

Let's try to enjoy the day.

Hands off, eh?

I'll roast that kid of yours.

Why you little jerk!

Hey! Antonio!

Violeta! Stop it!

I'll kill you, bitch!

Violeta, stop!

Violeta!

Violeta!

First you gave him a knife,

then you fight with a stranger?
Are you a good influence?

You've got to look for...

Yeah, I've started already.

I've bought a book.
I'm studying.

You bought it?

Yeah, smartass, I did.

I'm going to study.

Yeah, to be an engineer.

Working is the best way
to lead a normal life.

I'm going to study psychology.
How many times must I repeat it?

And Miguel, a Swiss army knife
is not a weapon.

It's a useful object.

It's even got a corkscrew
and a thing to clean your ears.

Antonio.

Careful with those ears, though.

We spoke with Gonzalo's dad

and he's prepared to let you
drive his taxi. How about it?

It's good money,
not like it used to be.

Do anything, for god's sake.
For once in your life.

I said I'm going to study!

That's the last time
you raise your voice to me.

Tomorrow you'll talk to Gonzalo's
dad and start work immediately.

You can't stay with Jorge
and Violeta forever.

He can stay as long as he likes.

I don't want to be
a taxi-driver.

I want to be a psychologist.

But that won't happen overnight.

You can’t just snap your fingers
and be a psychologist.

Antonio...

At 32 it's too late to choose.

Surprise!

What's this?

What do you think?
Our baby.

Look. That little thing
is its femur.

Its femur? Looks more like
a bird dropping to me.

Oh, stupid, don't say that.

We'll finally be a family.

You know what that means, Ramón?

Are you sure?

You know how many times we've
had sex in the last two months?

Of course I'm sure.
Look!

Shall we paint now or wait
and see if it's a boy or girl?

I can't decide between
a public or private nursery.

Three times in two months.

One, two, three.
Three times in two months.

Well look how lucky we've been.

To think that people
spend years tying

and we hit the bull
the first time round.

Don't worry, I told my dad
to give you a rise so we can...

Don't bring him into this!
I'll have to work even more.

No, it's not about him.

You should spend
more time with us.

Everything will be better
when the baby comes along.

Even...

sex.

What? I read that you can do it
even when you're pregnant.

Look, if you like,
I'll have some gin

and we can go at it.
It does my head in, but...

-You do my head in, Carla.
-I do your head in?

You mix your dad with the baby,
with the gin... it's no good.

I can't do it.

OK, darling, without the gin.

3, 4, testing.

-Taxi work's not easy, you know.
-Going hungry's harder.

Have you ever eaten rats
in the Sahara?

I have. You young people
have had it too easy.

That's true, but not Antonio.
He's a worker, aren't you?

I'm not scared of a little work.
Give me a week.

-He's got a great memory.
-Yeah?

-Unbelievable.
-Not like you.

Nice taxi, eh?

-He even failed his driving test.
-I was unlucky.

Eight times?

I always get the same examiner.
He hates me.

Tomás, your taxi
has no window divider.

That's for pussies.

I agree. The thing about being
a taxi-driver

is the contact with customers
and the window divider...

You've got the taxi
in your blood.

You remind me of myself
when I started.

But listen,
taxis aren't what they were.

All the "emigration"
and those darkies...

Hey, watch it!

I know who you are!

Antonio, come back over here.

Don't you worry, Tomás.

As long as I drive this cab,

all passengers must be clean
and pay up front.

Well said.

-So it's a deal?
-It's a deal.

Hello?

It's Violeta. I'm going for a drink
with Cristina and Antonia.

I know, you told me.

What a drag.
I really don't feel like it.

I'll just have one drink
and come home.

Maybe two or three.

<i>Don't wait up, OK?</i>

<i>How's your stomach?</i>

OK I guess.
Listen, I may be here all night...

studying a report.

Private conversations?

No, no. It's...

Good night.

Good night, Mr. Ramírez.

I'll stay here.

Violeta.

Listen, set aside 10 euros
and take a taxi home.

Goodbye.

Violeta?

You look beautiful.

Instead of booking a restaurant,
I took the liberty

of preparing a little picnic.

I wanted to talk to you
in a quiet place.

Can we stop at a gas station?

No, we're almost there.

And I wanted to show you

I'm not just
another businessman,

obsessed with making money.

I have other interests.
Art, poetry, a child's smile...

In short an all-rounder.
I'd describe myself...

as a love warrior,
a stupid romantic who thinks

it's the small gestures
that count.

Are you coming, Violeta?

Do you mind if
I read you my poem?

I can see you enjoy silence too.

It's called "Violeta."

"Your name is a flower.
Your eyes are sweet honey.

Fine silk your body...

As I sit alone,
you are right beside me.

Those veiled silences,
behind your lips in flower.

In flower...

like your name.

Violeta."

What's wrong?

Nothing, it's nothing.

Sometimes my eye goes,
but it's only a minute.

I wear a brace.

And also I'm complicated.

I mean,
I'm actually normal.

But initially, I'm complicated.
And I only wear my brace at home,

but I was nervous
and forgot to take it off.

I don't care about the brace.

Nor do I care about your eye.

Nobody's ever written me a poem.

-"No eating, no hair combing"?
-Only pigs comb their hair.

Not pigs.
You mean gypsies.

Not again.

A gypsy saved my life in prison,
so watch your mouth.

You've got to show
you mean business, Antonio.

Yesterday I almost smashed
this kid's head in...

What's your fucking problem?

Want me to smash your head in?

Never touch kids, Ramón!

You've got to discipline kids
by talking to them.

Ramón, are you alright?

Shit, if you've got a problem
I'm the one to talk to.

I'm fine, Antonio.

But I've had it with
your psychology crap.

It's not me.

People are in a bad way.

Like just now these two kids
got in the car with their G&T's

and "ha ha" this
and "ha ha" that...

I had to beat their asses
and leave them on the highway.

Because I used to be...
but respect, man, respect...

-You should never lose respect.
-Never.

And now I'm out on the town
with you lot,

eh, Gonzalo?
Enjoying a bit of conversation.

Tell us a story.

Well I was in an elevator
the other day

with this girl and she was...
Wow, she was tasty.

Gonzalo,
you're not getting much sex.

One year without it.
Since the ugly one.

Jorge told me.

Not a year, 6 or 9 months.
And she wasn't that ugly.

Gonzalo, look,
I'm taking you down the park.

You'd be surprised what they'll do
for a couple of bills. Coming?

You bet I am.

I've got toothache.

Are you going to fuck
with your teeth?

It'll be ready in two days.

Here. As usual.

I'll pay you now.

No, next time.

No, I'll pay you now.
Look, 2.50.

There it is.

Well fuck me,
it's the Monday misery.

The shirt again?
You'll make us rich.

It's just that...

I'm having you on.

Bingo.

So, today is Monday... Tuesday,
Wednesday... Wednesday then.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

<i>To be a good pedestrian,</i>
<i>first look around.</i>

<i>You'll be a superstar</i>
<i>and you'll never get run down.</i>

<i>If you see a red light,</i>

<i>don't cross, don't you dare...</i>

<i>You'll end up in a wheelchair.</i>

You want to give up patrolling
to sing that

in schools?

Last year 52 children
were run over in the district.

And modestly considering
myself a songwriter,

-I think...
-Please, Miguel.

Go back to work.

I feel so old...

In all modesty

I have written a more lively

"rap" version.

It goes something like this:

<i>To be a good pedestrian,</i>

<i>first look around.</i>
<i>You'll be a superstar...</i>

<i>A superstar...</i>

So,

so old.

You son of a bitch.

-Jorge.
-Did you see that?

-Jorge.
-What?

Have you considered therapy?

What?

Therapy, Jorge.
I'm worried about you.

In fact, I'm worried about
all of you. Have you seen Miguel?

What about him?

What do you mean?
Can't you see he's stooping?

And you know why?

He's got Patricia's foot on the back
of his neck and he can't get up.

Miguel's married, steady job,
he's fine. Watch the soccer.

-And Ramón and Gonzalo.
-They're fine.

We went whore-hunting
the other day.

Whore-hunting?

No, Antonio.

Don't go crazy.

Concentrate on the taxi.
On a normal life. Not hookers.

But you said Gonzalo
hadn't been laid for a year.

So?

You know what that nerd
is doing lately?

He jerks off to toll-free
information numbers.

Toll-free?

Yeah, because he says the voices
have a porno ring to them.

Gonzalo needs to do some serious
studying and get his fucking degree

and a job.

-Hello.
-Hi.

-Where did you go?
-For a drink with the girls.

-I'm having a shower.
-Next time call.

We were worried.
A shower at this hour?

Yes, what's the big deal?

In Europe everyone showers
at night and I feel like it.

-Well take a shower then.
-Go ahead.

And don't go whore-hunting.

I'm asking you nicely.
There are diseases...

-I did it for their own good.
-Save your money.

Asshole!

-Jorge, listen...
-What?

Your dad is bald, right?

Yeah, always has been.

OK. When you watch a match,
what goes through your mind?

Nothing. I just watch,
if I'm allowed.

When you watch the match

you're thinking that the ball
is your father's head

and you have to kick it.

Antonio, don't start getting
weird on me. No, no, no.

I'm perfectly fine.
It's you I'm worried about.

And the rest of them.
The thing is...

You want to hear a secret?

Tomorrow I'm going to ask
your sister Violeta to marry me.

Wow!

I've bought her a ring,
cost me a fortune.

That's great!

This place is really expensive.

Don't worry.

This month we haven't eaten out.
Only one trip to the cinema...

so we still have two left.

I also wanted to see you because
lately I've noticed you're a bit

-cold with me.
-Cold? No.

Yeah, ice cold,
but it's not your fault.

In fact,

I wanted to explain the dinner.

Sometimes...

I mean, in life... my father...
there's a point...

when a man has to live his life.

I've got to go to the toilet.

False alarm.

I was explaining

that there's a point in life

when a man has to take

a series of steps, and I know
the other day I was abrupt...

but I want to do things right.

I've got it all planned.

Life...

consists of...

moments...

Would you shut up!

Here. It fell.

Violeta.

Shit!

Will you marry me?

Don't you like it?

What do you say?

-It's lovely.
-I mean about getting married.

I don't know
if that's possible, Jorge.

It's so sudden
and it's a bad time right now.

We've been living together for two
years and going together for eight.

It's time for marriage.

I know, Jorge,
but I can't marry you now.

I'm in love

No...

I think so,
love is never really

straight forward, but...

Oh Jorge,
there are just times

in a woman's life
that it's not on.

Right?

<i>My love has been taken away</i>

<i>by the waves</i>

<i>like a fish that is sinking</i>

<i>into the abyss...</i>

I'm really busy.
Helping a friend to move.

Come on Jorge, big man.

Jorge, you're falling...
Down for the count.

What's wrong, Jorge?

-Leave me alone for a moment.
-Don't be a pussy.

-Just a moment.
-Up you go.

OK then.

I'm fine.

Cheer up, Jorge.
I'll look after you.

We'll be fine in the house.

-In your grandma's shit-hole?
-It's retro, man.

I'm sorry, but I'm in pain...

Shit, it's the trophy we won in
that soccer tournament, remember?

<i>We are the champions...</i>

The only time
I ever won anything.

I'm going to sort out
the removal van.

Listen guys, Jorge

is in a bad state.

He needs help.

Don't worry,
I've got a plan.

We'll sign up for a 7-aside
local soccer tournament.

Why would we play soccer
now, Antonio?

I'm very busy these days

preparing my part
for the movie.

What sort of creatures are you?

Jorge needs to win something.

I'll do it.
I'll be goalie.

How about swimming?
An all-round sport.

Yeah, or fucking water-polo!

Water-polo chicks
have great asses.

Or a bit of both.
Soccer and water-polo.

You can't swim, fatso.

Will you concentrate
for once in your lives

and think about other people?

We're going to play soccer

until we win.

Even if it takes three years.

Charly, when was the last time
you cleaned the bath?

October. October.

-I'll have to sit by him.
-Jorge, take a seat.

We've something to tell you.

We joined a soccer league.

Like the one we won, remember?

Do you want to play soccer,
Antonio?

Do I want to?

Do I want to?

-But we're only six.
-I know, I've got it covered.

I'll call a friend.

A born star.

-Where's the phone?
-In the bathroom.

We're going to be big,
real big.

Antonio.

Be careful.
It must stink in there.

No, it's not funny.

I know you don't want to,

neither do I.

But we have to.

Antonio is not well.

We have to help him.

A bit of soccer

will be good for him,
because he has

too much free time.

So from tomorrow

we start training...

with enthusiasm.

All the way.

That's it.

I can't run anymore.

We only started four minutes ago.

This is the best thing
we've ever done, eh, Jorge?

We've got to keep going.

Antonio, I'm dizzy.
Let's take it easy.

We can't take it easy,
can we?

No, you can't take it easy.
Ramón, stop smoking!

Dad, Mum says

to stop fucking around

for lunch!

Pablito, tell your mum to wait!
We're training!

I'm coming darling.

Dad, what's "fucking around"?

What daddy does
with that guitar.

Lunchtime!

Isn't 134 quite a high
pulse-rate?

-That's nothing.
-My chest hurts.

What's the name of our team?

Something funny like
"the Munich Munchkins"

or "Jus Godup"
or "Bitta Tapwater."

Miguel, you're in a sad way.

I'm starting to see white dots.

I'm shivering
and my chest is thumping.

-Go to the hospital, Gonzalo.
-It really hurts.

Now listen for one second.

I've thought of a name,
but it has to be a special name.

A winning name.

"Brazil."

"Brazil."

-I like it.
-Sounds good.

-"Bitta Tapwater" is better.
-"Brazil."

My chest is thumping.
And my vision is all blurry.

Gonzalo, lunch is ready.

-Coming, Mum!
-We haven't finished.

Gonzalo, fuck it,
Antonio's saying...

I'm sick of all this
running around.

No, Ramón, please.

Same time tomorrow.

Charly, we're training!

-Carlos!
-Charly!

-Well, do we keep going?
-We most certainly do.

Miguel, come right now
or you'll eat in the kitchen!

-Right.
-Pay no attention.

I've got to go, Antonio.

Shit, she's got you performing
like a monkey.

You're on a chain.

I'm sorry, Jorge.
This is it.

Well... maybe...

Shall we carry on or maybe...?

I said I wouldn't let you down.

I'll do three more laps with you.

Three?

Seven.

Six.

-Six laps?
-Seven, seven.

If we go the other way
we won't get dizzy.

-Go on then.
-Here we go.

This'll do us good.

You're looking good.
Looking good, Antonio.

Not again!

I told you it's alright.
You can wear your brace.

There, that's it.

Violeta?

Hi!

We're watching a great movie.

What the fuck...

Who's this?

Daniel?

Yes.

You're Antonio. Pleased to meet you.
I've heard so much.

What are you playing,
dressing up?

No, this is something that...

Sit down.

Yes.

Go on, sit.

Well I don't know much
about you at all.

So let's have a little chat
the three of us.

Just a little while.

OK.

Do you have parents?

Carlos, fuck it, place it here!

Pass the fucking ball!

Look, like this.

Like this.

Shit!

Jorge, why did you
get in the way?

-You're not with it.
-I'm OK.

Why were you in the way?
Why?

-Got an itch?
-You too?

-When?
-The hooker.

-We caught something.
-What?

I don't know. Syphilis, a chancre,
gonorrhea, VD or something.

Antonio, we caught something from
the hooker. Does your cock itch?

My cock is my business.
Concentrate on the game.

We're here to win.

Jorge, we went to a hooker.

I know. This is a complete mess.
We should all be...

A man is made to work, pay his
mortgage and look after his family.

That's life. Not hookers.

Gonzalo needs hookers.
It's an experience for him.

-Don't mess things up.
-Don't mess what up?

Come on, let's see.
Did you use a condom?

Of course we did.

Little warts...

Typical glocozoma.

Get a brush and put some anti-septic
on your dick. I have some.

Gonzalo, put your prick away.

To think you paid for sex.

Maybe you should try it.

My sex life is completely normal.

Don't tell Carla about it.

Carla won't find out.
She's stuck at home pregnant.

Carla's pregnant?
And you with a rotten dick.

-What if you infected the kid?
-You're having a kid?

Congratulations.

You need to decide:
public or private nursery.

Children's schooling
is a real trauma, but you have to...

Get off my back.

I'm going to stay on your back.

The first five years of a child's
life will shape its personality.

I'll be watching you.

Just a bit, my balls hurt.

It's not fair. You screw around
your whole life and nothing happens.

I see a hooker once
and I'm screwed.

I told you to use a good condom.

You can't sell your cock short.
Is that a bite?

Can't you see I'm going to die?

I'm diseased!
This whole area's fucked up!

Please! Please!

This is Serafín,
our seventh man.

This is Miguel, Ramón, Charly,
Jorge and Gonzalo.

Hello.

-Pleased to meet you.
-Welcome.

You're the actor, right?

Well don't act up to me, OK?

And no looking at her.
Not you or anyone.

Let it be clear from the start.
This is the sort of company I keep.

-Sit down, baby.
-I'll just put this down.

-Now let's play properly!
-Antonio, who is he?

He's a gentleman. A magician.

I'll give you a call, OK.
Bye.

Look out!

Oh fuck it!

Fucking hell!

Gonzalo, what are you?
A statue?

-It was unstoppable.
-No, it wasn't.

-Yeah, but it was a strike.
-A strike?

There are no strikes
when you're 30.

It's my fault. I'm really bad,
and I got a cramp.

No, <i>they're</i> bad.

-You're a cripple.
-We need a one-two.

A strike!

And you left me alone.
Either defend or...

Gonzalo, don't cry, man.
Don't cry on me.

Miguel, look down the wing.

Well pass it to me.

Pass it on.

We can catch them up!

She's very attractive
your friend.

Attractive? Her pussy looks like
a cat stretched out.

Now listen, please.

Listen up!

What we need to do
is visualize our victory.

If we don't do that,

this is a load of shit,

the biggest shit ever!

I'm visualizing on the wing,
but no one passes to me.

You saw, didn't you?

Don't look at her.
I'll end your career with one call.

You don't know who I am.
You'll never work in cinema again.

Whenever I fucking feel like it.

It wasn't like that...

-I'll smash your head in.
-OK, I get it.

Don't worry, Antonio.
He'll see.

Serafín, I'm sorry.

No, don't you suffer.
You and I are above all this.

Come on, "Brazil"!

Jorge!

Come on, let's go!

Hello?

Well fuck me,
it's a producer.

Come on, pass it!

What's that asshole doing?

Show him my video-book.
Go on, shoot.

Let's see what you've got!

Damn it, you were alone again!

We can't play without T-shirts.

The fuck with it. I'm not letting
a bunch of kids beat me!

-Boys, the ball.
-They're not boys.

They're grown men.

I can see the light.

I can see the light.

Bye, baldy!

Son of a bitch.

No respect, no values...

Fuck you!

What are you doing here?

Nothing, it's my coffee break.
How's the whole baby thing going?

-We're fucking delighted.
-Sure.

I'll tell that
slag mother of yours

what a son of a bitch you are!

Fuck you, faggot!

You're at an important time
of your life.

You've got to be there
and centered.

Spare me the psycho crap.
No more Dr. Antonio.

I'm not like Antonio.

That light thing
and the weird stuff...

Your friend's a pussy!

He means you.

They're just kids.
They don't know.

If you've got any problems
just let me know, OK?

Martin!

Take your feet off the seat
or I'll rip your fucking head off!

<i>Ramón, you piece of shit.</i>

<i>Baldy, baldy prick.</i>

<i>Your mother is a slag.</i>

<i>Your father is a fag...</i>

I'm off.

I heard the president
of the FIFA last night...

It's not looking good.

We'll give them a beating.

No, when it gets to the match...

See you, Ramón.

<i>Baldy, baldy prick.</i>

<i>Your mother is a slag.</i>
<i>Your father is a fag...</i>

<i>Ramón, you piece of shit.</i>

Macarena.

Hello.

When did you get out?

Not long ago.

Are you alright?

I'm working as a cab-driver now.

They've put me in charge.

Yeah, Toñi told me.

Everything OK?

Yes.

You'd given up smoking.

This is a load of shit.

Do you like driving the cab?

Yes.

And I'm studying psychology.

I've missed you loads.

Me too.

Do you want a ride?

I won't charge you the fare.

Yes or no?

Yes.

Hop in.

Do you like it?

I don't know.

Well it comes with a surprise.

Stop pushing me about, Carla.
I'm reading.

Aren't you going to open it?

Well, I'll open it then.

A weekend trip to Paris!

You've always wanted
to go there.

What money?

My father gave it to me. He's over
the moon with his first grandchild.

By the way, he says definitely
a private nursery.

Don't talk to him about our stuff.
I'm fed up of telling you.

Well are you pleased
about the trip?

I can't go that weekend.
I've got a match.

Well I'll change it...

I'm tying to read.

There's just no way.

Honey.

Do you think I have talent?

No.

Say what you want, Antonio,

but don't bring up my father's
relationship with me as a child.

It gives me the shivers
what you're doing.

Goodbye.

Jorge, Jorge, Jorge.

Another 15 cock-ups
that'll cost me half a grand?

You think I want to lose
half a grand?

No, but I revised it...

-No, no, no.
-Not just once.

Shut up.

Shut up, Jorgito, I'm talking.

Have you seen my car
parked outside?

-You like it, don't you?
-Yes, I do.

The insurance costs me
half a grand. Will you pay it?

Well?
What are you looking at?

You're not going to pay it?

Well, I'm not going to pay out
half a grand because of you.

And I won't fire you
because that would cost too much.

You're stuck here forever.

<i>And if you try</i>
<i>to fuck me up again,</i>

<i>I'll crush you into the ground.</i>

<i>I'll be your shadow.</i>

-Jorge! Lend me 5 euros.
-5 euros?

But pay me back.
I've only ten left.

Too bad for you.
How's your belly?

Fine.
Where are you going?

To the dry cleaner's
to see the blondie!

-You mean to wash them...
-Yeah, obviously.

-But I wash and clean at home...
-You can't, you're exhausted!

They're clean, they smell of
softener. Come on, let's go home.

You're right. Come on then.

What are you doing?

That's it.

Give me the pants!

Give me the pants!

-You're not looking good.
-I wash and iron, I told you.

-I'll make you an egg soup!
-I hate egg soup!

Jorge, please!

-Hello, gorgeous.
-Hello, handsome.

Hi.

-I've brought these pants.
-Half of them.

But what have you done, boy?
You're crazy.

Half a pair of pants.

Here's the other half!
Thanks, man.

What a surprise,
today's not Monday.

It's not?

Well, in that case...

So I've got no clothes
to pick up?

No.

OK then, you're on your way.

What's wrong? You look ill.

No, nothing.
We're in a hurry, aren't we?

We've got to hurry
because we're in a hurry.

I was in a hurry because
I wanted to ask you for dinner.

Son of a bitch.
It's been pissing me off all day.

When are we going to dinner?
Tonight?

Wait a minute. This isn't
a good place. The table's wet.

Let's try the kitchen.
There's a table...

in there.

Make sure you feed
that cute little ass...

What does your job involve?

My job?

It's hard to explain.
It involves cleaning clothes,

which include a shirt of yours
once a week.

That's because I like
to go to work looking smart.

I don't think anyone could ever
criticize my appearance.

I'm inflexible about that,
joking apart.

Only your shirt?

No, everything.

My job involves numbers,
I mean, I work with paper.

The lower half of my body
is completely covered up.

I hang up my jacket every morning,
so it all comes down to my shirt.

Jorge, you're really cute.

In my job I have
an intermediary function

but with prospects of promotion.

I think I have a positive image

in the company and anytime now
I could get moved up.

-Do you feel at ease?
-Very much.

Management really trusts in me
and that's important.

Kiss me.

Any promotion prospects
at the dry cleaner's?

Jorge, do you like me?

Don't worry.

When I worked at the brewery
I built up some strong arms.

What a great night!

Yesterday I'd never have believed
I'd be having such fun tonight.

Right, Jorge?

Sometimes I feel like going to the
station and getting on a train...

to anywhere...

Idiot!

What's the matter?
What's all the train shit?

I don't know.

Big mistake, Jorge.
Don't you like her?

-It's not that.
-We'll swap.

No, no.

The spunky one turns me on.
Yours isn't bad either.

That's it.
Put the plate down.

Orgy.

How about a few shots?

-No.
-Shall we dance?

I don't know how to dance.

Look.

-Like that, like that.
-I can't, I'm sorry.

I have to get up early tomorrow.

-OK then, I'll be going.
-Going?

What do you mean?

The night is young. Jorge,
did you tell her about my movie?

No.

Shall we play the shots game?

What game's that?

Are you staying?

Yeah, I think I'll fuck this one.

Jorge, you should know
I really like you.

<i>And therapy?</i>
<i>It'd do them some good.</i>

I haven't stopped
going on about it,

but they don't understand.
So what happens?

I have to look out for each
fucking one of them and right now

it's too much crap.
It's a bad time.

I'm just getting started
with the taxi...

There's lots of little things
to think about:

picking up a fare, "bim,"
the numbers.

Whenever someone waves, "bam"...

pulling up to the sidewalk...

That's really nice.
You've got the taxi in your blood.

-I've learnt the Bible by heart.
-In a week?

I've got the outskirts left.

That's what surprises me about you.
You're really sharp.

What I wanted
to talk to you about is this.

They have to start winning
at soccer.

Do you get me?
If they see themselves winning...

A goal, another goal...

that will encourage them
in their lives

and help them see the light.

Let me tell you something.
I've said it a thousand times.

Life is complicated.

Although it seems simple,
the going's not always easy.

I know. For them to get their heads
round something like this...

-Four months.
-Each.

Why do you think
my sister left Jorge?

For that exact reason.
He doesn't get it and he's a bit...

-A bit...
-Dull.

Yeah, sort of murky.

Yeah, like a bit blurry,
like something... yeah.

Well you'll have to help me out.

I'm here whenever you need me.

Because it's all five of them.

And heavy problems,
because in my book

their kind of problems
aren't even in there.

So will you help me or what?

Will I help you, Antonio?

Antonio, if you say it's daytime,
for me it's daytime.

Friends in need
are friends indeed.

-OK.
-Alright.

Here goes.

Here's to you
and your balls.

Let's see, you studs.
We've got a surprise for you.

New T-shirts and shorts.
The complete kit.

We needed a better
"equipament."

Brazil! Shit...

But we're "Bitta Tapwater."

Good on you, Antonio.
Now there's no stopping us.

Remember the tactics
I showed you.

With this dick...

They'll burn them with a blowlamp
and scorch our dicks to cinder.

Even if it's burnt you can...

No way. Month and half
without getting laid.

Carla would go on heat.

And careful jacking off!

Don't get distracted:
think tactics.

Study while you can, Gonzalo.

No, no. You do it.

You should have tried sandpaper.

-On our dicks?
-And anywhere else.

Sorry, I had to bring the baby.
Patricia had plans.

To hell with kids.

-By the way...
-No, fuck by the way.

Careful, eh? You don't know me.
I'll break your...

Here.
Four's your lucky number.

With new T-shirts
we've got to perform, OK?

Who's come to see
uncle Antonio?

You want a T-shirt? We don't have
one for you, you're too little.

Can we jerk off with a rubber?
There's less friction...

Fuck your jerking off
and your frictions.

What's wrong, Jorge?
Are you OK?

Listen, remember Antonio's
tactics everybody, come on.

OK, you owe us 30.50 each
for the T-shirts.

Wasn't it 30?

Brazil!

Pass it!

It's the wind, man.

Good, that's it!

Good job.

I got it!

-What are you doing?
-I didn't realize.

-You didn't realize?
-I'll kick your ass.

You're not well!

It was my fault.

You're messing it up
for everyone.

Touch the ball again and I'll break
your legs and your mother's too.

I know where you live.

-Fatso.
-What?

Antonio for god's sake...

Antonio, are you OK?

This is a load of shit.

This is not working.

They're messing up
my fucking therapy.

Listen, Antonio, you and I
are going to have to relax a bit.

Do you see how sad that is?

It's pathetic.

We should carry on.
We can still come 7th.

7th out of ten!

-At least we wouldn't be last.
-Stop talking shit.

I'm not sure either.
The problem is...

That's fine.
You just give up

and be losers for the rest
of your fucking lives.

Sit down, Antonio. Where are you
going? We're making progress.

He's right.
Don't be like Clemente.

What matters is playing well.
And we play well. Like Brazil.

Gonzalo, this dick thing
is affecting your brain.

Shit! The baby!

We left the baby on the pitch!
Fucking hell!

Antonio, no!

OK, OK, stop.

Let's get the kid!

Over there!

There, there. It's OK.

Fucking hell, Miguel.

There, there, there.

Don't let that happen again.

You know how traumatic
it is for him?

I should abandon you somewhere
and see how you feel.

-Unbelievable. Some father.
-It's OK, shit.

Shit, Miguel,
are you out of your head?

-All set.
-They found him.

-Sleeping like an angel, he was.
-We can all sit down now.

Who would take
such an ugly thing?

That's just bad luck.
Well that's great. Bye now.

My movie's put back
because they can't find a pig.

What do you mean a pig?

A trained piglet has a part
in the movie.

They can't find a pig in Spain?

Now it's the pig.
Six months ago the Catalonian model

who couldn't do a Russian accent.

Do you know how big
the problem is?

Spanish cinema is at a standstill.
TV networks don't buy movies.

-Have you done a pooh-pooh?
-Who's producing it?

-Jorge, help me out.
-"Poliedro Productions."

I worked with them,
but they weren't professional

enough for me.
But I might be able to help

that shitty career of yours.

Shitty?
What are you talking about?

The girl from the dry cleaner's
called me.

And?

I told her I had things to do...

What's wrong?

Nothing.

-Miguel...
-What?

He needs... it's...

This is what doctors call

a micro-penis.

Hello, sorry I'm late.

Violeta's boyfriend goes cross-eyed
whenever they shag.

Only in one eye.
It's executive stress.

Stress?
And what's wrong with you?

Ramón.

What about him?

He doesn't want...

and it's probably my fault
because I know so little...

not because I'm pregnant.
You can hardly tell.

Not at all. Just touching Ramón
is enough. He's always horny.

You're so sensitive.

You're the big expert.
What should I do?

I don't know.

Handcuff him,
or mop the house in underwear...

Are you retarded?
Clean the house in her underwear?

They love that. I don't know why,
but porno-maids get them going.

Don't even think about it.

She wouldn't suggest it
if it didn't work.

-That explains your success story.
-What?

One's got the shits
and the other's cross-eyed.

You haven't got a fucking clue
about love.

Shit, Patricia,
it's only the one eye.

He puts the glasses on
and everything's fine. With time...

The only thing that happens
with time is things get worse.

If I have to dress up,

I'll fucking well dress up,
but what as?

-Don't ask me.
-As a teacher, as a nurse...

Look, it's dumbo.
What do you want now?

I'm busy.

What?

Miguel.

Antonio, don't worry.

It could happen to anyone.
All kids look alike.

You retard, I'll kill you!

-I didn't mean to.
-You didn't mean to?

-It was a mistake.
-It wasn't on purpose.

If he doesn't turn up,
I'll kill you all!

Let's not worry,
the kid can't have gone far.

Make another joke, asshole.

-Retard.
-Idiot.

Don't worry, we'll find him.

-García, any news?
-Nothing yet.

Well, go and fucking look.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-How are you?
-Fine, what about you?

Fine.

You haven't picked up your stuff.

No, I thought I'd do it
this weekend.

-No, I don't mind...
-I'll come by.

-Really, Jorge, it's OK.
-lf it's in the way...

Miguel.

You see? There he is.

-They're identical.
-Sorry, I was really worried.

Sure you don't mind?
I can sleep in the living room.

No, not with your bad back.
Come on, get in.

Cover yourself up.

Sure you don't want any dinner?

No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

This room is Carlos'
grandma's room, isn't it?

You mean the smell?

Yeah, leftovers, animals...

I clean it every day, I swear.
But it's hard to get rid of.

-The mattress...
-Pablito's got a parrot.

Miguel, please,
don't be sad. We're fine.

-Please.
-I don't know.

Underneath I was expecting this.

The baby thing was a mistake,
but it was no big deal.

It's just that...

I can do nothing right.

Patricia has never loved me.

Of course she loves you.
Why else marry you?

Because she was pregnant.

You sleep with the radio on?

Yeah, lately.
Shall I turn it off?

No, I like it.

Shall we turn off the light?

Good night.

Sheep.

What?

The smell.

It smells of sick sheep.

Could be.

Life is tiring.

Hello.

What are you doing?

A bit of cleaning.

You clean stark naked?

What? Don't you like it?

Shall I give you a dusting?

Dusting?

Dusting...

Did you think of me?

Heaps. And you of me?

Loads.

What did you think?

That I loved you.

Same as me.

I also thought of other things.

Me too.

You might change
when you're a psychologist.

I'll bore you.
I didn't even finish my training.

That'll never happen.

You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

I'm really sorry about everything.
I wish I could go like that

and rub it all out.

Now...

Now with the cab

I'm making 7,000 pesetas a day,

and...

with your wage it adds up
to quite a lot, doesn't it?

Do you want to marry me?

Yes?

I'm getting married.

I'm marrying Macarena.

Antonio!
You had me worried!

That's it, Antonio.
No to crazy things, yes to marriage.

-Have you thought it through?
-Sure he has!

-And his decision is sacred.
-When's the wedding?

-Next month.
-On the 22nd.

That soon?

Sera got me in on
the parish lists.

I'm impulsive with these things.
I'm a kamikaze.

What matters is getting married.

With the taxi and this
you're on the right road.

But Jorge, please,
forget about my sister.

-Don't start Antonio.
-No, don't you start.

Miguel, I hope you'll sing a song
at the wedding.

But one you like.
Not that pedestrian song.

But I can't...

Bárbara?

Dinner?

-Tell her to bring a friend.
-I can't.

I can't because...

Yes, he's going, that's right.

-I said no!
-Eleven?

What are you doing?

Lorena too...

OK. Goodbye.

I'm not going. I'm not...

Give me the phone.

Carlos, what are you doing?

What happened about the movie?
Did you find a pig?

-No, no such luck.
-Come on.

You see? Loads of them.

That one looks like
my father-in-law!

Check their faces.
Pick the smartest one.

How can we tell?
Shall we test its IQ?

-Look for the gleam in its eyes.
-Eyes on the pigs please.

This is going to sort Charly out.

-Look at that shrewd little one.
-Does this pay well?

Sure.

Leave it to me,
you'll have a fairy-tale wedding.

-Look at the pigs.
-OK. Let's see.

Look. I like that one.

-Which one?
-With the red mark.

I'll get him.

-He looks retarded.
-Give him a chance!

His eyes are close together.
He looks sick. Leave him there.

-Leave him there.
-Please come here a moment.

Don't get lost now
for god's sake.

I don't trust Ramón.
I didn't want him here.

We need him here
in case there's trouble.

He needs our help. His father-in-law
always does everything for him.

Will your cousin
know how to train them?

He has a way with animals.
You remember the pony...

There. The one that looks like
my father-in-law.

This one's definitely got
an idiotic face on it.

That one, that one.

That one!

-He's a cripple for god's sake.
-Is the pig going to dance?

What's going on there?

Run!

This fucker weighs a ton!

Run, Antonio!

-Antonio!
-Come on!

Let's go, move it!

Here!

Start the car, man!

Start the car!

Here he comes!

Sit down, Manolito.

Look.

He was about to sit down there.

The little bastard understands
everything. He's being a rebel.

Listen, Julián.

The pig has to do things,
it has to...

What's that?

The billygoat,
it's got to do somersaults...

That's nothing.

He'll end up reading.
Clever little son of a bitch.

OK Julián.

Have you ever done this?

A dog, I had to...
one crazy dog.

A dog isn't a swine
for god's sake!

Keep going, Ramón.

I've been wanting to punch
your face in for two weeks now.

-Come on, cut the punches.
-Take it easy.

Sera, this is important.
There's a lot of dough involved.

I'm getting married, he's having
a kid and there's Carlos' movie.

-Are you doubting me?
-No, I'm not.

This is Félix Rodríguez
de la Fuente.

He has a gift. A gift.
Didn't you see

that sad look on the pig's face
in the car? Look at him now.

He's laughing, the bastard.

Funny little fucker.

He'll be the piglet version
of Lassie.

What the...

I'm not going. We can have
a quiet night and read a bit...

-Make another tortilla.
-I'm not going.

It's easy for you Carlos,
I haven't dated in 9 years.

With onion?

Stop making omelettes.
Jorge, you are going. You're tense.

And what's best for tension?

-Sex.
-Sex.

Jorge, let's go over it again.

You're having dinner
in a restaurant.

Don't let her see you want
to screw her, or you never will.

"I don't want to...
No baby... Not now..."

You ask for wine
and make her drink.

What do I say meanwhile?

Make her drink.
After dinner.

And then?

-A café, something interesting.
-What do I say?

It's obvious.
Make her drink.

Miguel, what do I do?

After the café take her to a bar
and make her drink.

-Mistake.
-Mistake.

Let her drink, but not too much.
Because then what happens?

We've got a plan.

You'll bring her here
to show her your drawings.

I don't draw.
That's it, I can't go.

No matter. You can hypnotize her
with my guitar.

Yeah! None of that
romantic stuff, Charly.

I'm not going, relax!
What are you doing?

What's that?

What's that?
A hand, a hand.

What does your hand do?
Jerk you off.

My drawings.

You'll show her my drawings.
I do some painting.

Will that work?

You'll see tomorrow when he wakes up
with his balls drained.

Of course it works.

The stranger the lie
the less people believe you.

Lie with style.
You'll fuck her, Jorge.

I am horny...

-What about the drawing bit?
-Shut up.

You're going to fuck her.

I'll dress you up, comb your hair
and you'll fuck her.

Repeat after me:
"I'm going to fuck her."

"I'm going to fuck her."
You're going to fuck her.

<i>You're going to fuck her...</i>

<i>Fuck... fuck...</i>

Are you OK?

Great, wonderful.

I feel just fine, just fine.

Please, have some wine.
I thought that after dinner

we could go to a café.

A nearby café.

Did you know I like to draw?

They, they...
I'm mixing one thing with another.

More wine?

I mean,

I've always had this love

of snatching up a piece of paper

and with four strokes
creating a face...

a forest, birds in flight...

So the thing is,

I've got a portfolio at home

that you might like
to have a peek at.

You might like that.

Don't you like drawing?

Have some wine.

Charly, she doesn't like drawing.
I'm going.

Don't you come here.
What?

What?

Cinema.

You must like movies
because everyone does.

The thing is I've got
a Dolby system at home,

DVD with Dolby.

It's hard to explain right now,

but it's like having it behind you,
on both sides, in front...

So in space movies
it's as if the spacecraft is...

-and horses in cavalry movies...
-Jorge, shut up.

You've been talking crap
all night.

Let's see, I'm a woman,

can you see that?
With a pair of tits,

which are practically

invisible to you.

And you are a man
with your bits.

Well that's it, let's have fun,
play around.

Jorge, I have no idea why,

but you get me really horny.

I want to fuck you.

Do you want to fuck me?

Well no... Yes.

Please say it. I can't take it
any more, you're doing my head in:

"Yes, I want to fuck you."

Drink!

Again!

Jorge,

I want wild sex with you.

-I want wild sex with you.
-Well done.

Drink.

-Wait.
-What?

-Already?
-No, no.

I don't want him to do
acrobatics or somersaults,

or even sit down,
just when you call him...

Boom, he comes.

Don't worry, he will. He got
the pony in town to do cartwheels.

-Here.
-Thanks.

He tripped him!

Gonzalo!

Gonzalo!

Gonzalo!

The money.

The money or I'll kill you!

I'll rip off your moustache,
you asshole!

-This is what gets to me.
-Relax, I got it back.

Manolito, "come here."

I speak English to him.

In Spanish,
speak to him in Spanish.

Animal psychology
is to be applied in English.

Psychology my foot.

Go Brazil!

It has a cold, septic side.

A vertical tendency
that represents man's angst

and his desire to reach higher...

If we cover this area...

Miguel, this is a load of shit.

All of it.

No, the first one
who gets near you...

in the ass.

What are you doing?

Please!

Please!

Hey, what is it?

-He's useless.
-Kill the pig.

Look, he went right to him!

No he didn't!

Seven more.

You must have some problem
worth mentioning.

Just let it out.

<i>"Dear professor:</i>
<i>I am writing</i>

<i>to ask you kindly and for your own</i>
<i>good to make sure your student</i>

<i>Gonzalo Pascual graduates.</i>
<i>If you don't, we will be obliged</i>

<i>to take certain measures that could</i>
<i>be unpleasant for your family."</i>

<i>-What matters most.</i>
<i>-Exactly, what matters most.</i>

<i>"We know where you live</i>
<i>and where your kids go to school.</i>

<i>-Yours sincerely, anonymous.</i>
<i>-P.S.</i>

<i>Make it a B.</i> "

B

Jorge, please, relax.

Every time I look up
he's staring at me,

his eyes are burning into me.

I'm convinced he wants me to work
with my nose on the desk.

But any day now I'm going
to stand up to him and say:

"Look, asshole.

You can take the job
and shove it up your ass."

What are you going to say?

"Shove the job...

I can't take any more."

Of what?

Of life.
Shall I order the tiramisu?

Jorge, let's go.

Yeah, forget dessert.

Let's leave Madrid.

In the holidays?

No, now.

But where?

Who cares? Where ever.
Far away.

For how long?

It doesn't matter.

But Bárbara, I have a job.
At 6:15

-my alarm clock goes off...
-Fuck your job.

Let's go.

No crazy stuff please.

I've got a job, responsibilities.

My friend Antonio's
wedding Saturday...

And the last league match.

-Don't confuse me.
-OK, we'll do this:

Saturday when you finish
I'll pick you up,

we catch a train, any train,
and we're off.

Jorge, I've thought it through.

I'm fed up with the dry cleaner's
and the neighborhood. I'm leaving.

I'd like it if you came with me.

You know what I'm going to do now?

Don't write on that.

I feel like it.

SUCK YOU OFF

No, Bárbara, no.

It turns me on.

No.

No.

Come out from under there.
Come on.

-Good evening.
-Good evening.

-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

Very well.
I'm having dinner here alone.

There's a glass for everyone
these days.

Yeah, these modern restaurants...

Jorge, Daniel.

Jorge.

What a situation!

My ossobucco's coming up...

Isn't the wedding a surprise?

Wedding?

-Yes.
-Antonio's wedding! Unbelievable.

Well, we'll go and sit down.

-Here or...
-No, there.

-We've got a table.
-Fine, no problem.

Nice to meet you.

Hey, man...

That ossobucco!

Eat up, eat up...

Great guy Jorge.
Is he always like that?

This place has great

-Farfalli.
-Let's go.

Excuse me?

Let's go.

-What about the Farfalli?
-Screw the Farfalli.

Fucking Farfalli!

I'll do the talking.
There's cash to be made.

Charly doesn't know
about this?

Nothing. He'll be so happy when
he sees we've sorted it all out.

Take it easy, champ.
You'll be a star.

Sit down, Manolito.

OK, that's enough.
Let him rest.

I've got to get some studying done.
My exam's tomorrow.

No problem. You need to study.
You know how it goes:

"Work hard, play hard." You'll have
A's coming out of your ears.

-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

I think there's been a mistake.

No mistake. I assure you
there's nothing like Manolito.

You should see him on film.

You've been misinformed. We don't
need a pig. There's no movie.

Wait. No movie
with Carlos Liaño?

Never heard of him.

What? Carlos Liaño.

-Really, I've never heard of him.
-He tricked us.

-Wait, are you sure?
-Absolutely.

Don’t joke around, OK?

We only make
industrial videos here.

Industrial videos?
What the fuck!

Antonio, he lied to us.
I'll kick the shit out of the pig...

Gentlemen, quiet please.

Cunning son of a bitch.

Carlos is one hell of an actor.
Acting all this time...

Don't delude yourself, a good kick
in the balls and it's over.

Who gets kicked in the balls?

Shall I punch your head in?
Will I ever get through to you?

Could you do a test
on the pig anyway?

I told you we don't need any pigs.

Sit down, Manolito, sit down.

Well, remember it's his first
job experience.

But even big stars go through that.
Like Francis the Donkey.

There are the most popular.
The quality is exceptional.

Yeah, but I want white napkins
and tablecloths.

White, traditional wedding white.
Bring me white ones, please.

Antonio does everything wrong.
This is no way to prepare a wedding.

-They'll be just fine.
-Nobody is just fine.

He's going to leave me.
I do what I can, but...

Well good.

Since Miguel left
I'm in heaven.

Now Miguel had something in his
favor, he didn't go cross-eyed.

-He still does that, right?
-Yes, but I...

I think I'm going
to leave Daniel.

Heard anything about Jorge?

Yeah, he's retarded. Forget about
Jorge and Mr. Cross-eyed.

This green is disgusting.
What if I set up a trio?

-It would work, wouldn't it?
-Please, Carla, drop it.

-Why not just forget it?
-Because I love him.

I don't know why,
but I love him.

Please.
What's up with you now?

Well, I saw Jorge the other day
in a restaurant with a girl

and she was...

sucking his...

How terrible, how terrible...

So what? So what?

Jorge initially wasn't like that.
He was different...

I think I've made a mistake.

Maybe getting married
wasn't such a bad idea.

Sometimes I could just do
with a swig of gin.

This isn't on the course.

What do you mean,
not on the course?

This isn't right.
It wasn't in my book.

I'm sorry I can't help you.

Who wrote these questions?

Tell whoever wrote these questions
to come here.

If you continue
I'll call security.

I won't budge

until you tell me
who wrote the questions.

I'm going to talk to the person
who wrote this.

I'm going to his office.

RUN OFF WITH BARBARA
ADVANTAGES - DISADVANTAGES

-Dad!
-Hey, tiger!

How's it going Antoñito?
How are you doing, man?

Hey! Watch the suit.
I'm fucking nervous.

It's the most important day
of your life.

You've got the rings,
haven't you?

I'd forget my heart
before the rings.

I hope this is quick.
We have a match...

Forget soccer, we haven't won
a match yet and we might be late.

Don't give me that attitude now.

We have time.
We're going to win today.

-What's that?
-Nothing.

-The invitation list?
-No, nothing.

Is there prawn cocktail
at the banquet?

No seafood, too expensive.
Mixed fry-up.

Good, that's more filling.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

Please. Ask me for a minute
and I'll give you my watch.

Here, take it. And chin up,
you've passed for god's sake.

Is that the tie
your mother gave you?

What's wrong with Antonio?

Shit, she's coming.

Here she comes.

It's her. Come on, come on.

Come on, everyone inside.

Jorge!

Please! Please!

Let me by,
I've got to be in there.

Come on Brazil,
we'll be late!

-Good-looking, wasn't I?
-Like an angel.

Come on, chin up!
You're the best.

This is a load of shit, Serafín.

What shall we do?
Listen, what shall we do?

What then?

Hey, cousin!

Got my sandwich!

-What then?
-Hang on, hang on.

-Where's the ref?
-He had to go.

What do you mean,
had to go?

-He had to run. Personal affair.
-His mum's ill.

If they protest, give them a card.
These punks are always complaining.

Come on!

-Show them you mean business.
-OK, let's go.

-Very strange.
-Yes, he is.

Over here, Ramón!

-Penalty!
-Blow your whistle!

Penalty!

What the hell is that?

Damnit, he took a dive!

Who did?

Goal!

Let's go!

You blow a foul against me?
Your cousin?

Change it or go back
to your village!

-Village? I'm from Mortalaz.
-Shut up, asshole!

I was wrong!
I take it back!

He made a mistake!

Back off!

Goal!

Charly, over here!

Shoot!

Goal!

Goal!

He's not throwing it in right.

-Foul.
-I haven't thrown it yet!

You were going to, I saw you.
Shut up or you get a warning!

-Antonio, here goes.
-Do it!

Here we go!

How can you call a penalty?

-I'll shoot!
-No, not you!

I'll shoot it so fuck you!

Why's he so angry with me?
What have I done?

Hold on,
let me talk to him.

-Jorge, what's up?
-I'm shooting it!

OK, OK.

But please...

One second, referee.

Please...

try to...

Just a minute, ref,
just a minute.

This is a moment of massive
importance in your life,

in mine and everyone's.

Keep out of this for god's sake.

Look at the ball and think,

you've got to picture it.
Your father's head.

Antonio, leave my father alone!
Leave my father out of it!

Just drop it!

Careful the sun's behind him,
there's a glare.

Imagine your father
talking to you.

Goal!

Jorge!

It's a goal.

-End the match.
-There's a minute left.

Do it!
Three strong whistles.

Time!

We've won!

Hit the showers everyone.

See the gleam in his eyes?
What it means to win?

Jorge, Jorge!

Fucking unbelievable.

Superstar!

This'll raise your spirits,
you'll see.

You're a genius.
You've got a gift of psychology.

-I don't know about that...
-I'm telling you...

-Sera...
-What is it?

I want to talk to you...

I've been thinking...

I have a personal project.

Have you realized
how people need therapy

but don't have the time?

I have a solution.

What?

Taxi-therapy.

Taxi-therapy?

You give them therapy...
on the road.

Taxi-therapy.

You are...

you are...

I can see it, I'm seeing it.

This could be global.

I want to do it right, Serafín.
I'll need a bit of money

to invest in some nice
leather seats

and a music system
with weird music...

You got it.

I'll give you 2,000 euros
to begin with.

Whatever you get is yours.

But please, try and sort out
a driving licence.

Yeah, sure.

-I'll pick you up at nine.
-At the door.

Fuck the job, fuck soccer.

Not here...

That belly of yours...

-What about your movie?
-How's the sexy groom?

Here you go, you deserve it.

The movie's going ahead,
but I'm not doing it.

Problems with the pig.
They cut my part out.

You know what I'm doing now?
"Off-stage."

You're one hell of an actor,
Carlos. A fucking star.

To hell with producers.

How was your exam?

It went very well.
But I think I'm giving it up.

Psychology's not so much about
studying, it's having a gift.

Otherwise you reach a point
where you don't see people,

you just see books.

No don't think so much, Antonio.

What a beautiful couple, magical,
so "genuwine," so sudden.

My hairs are on end.

-Thanks for the suit, cousin.
-No problem. You look great.

I've got a girl begging for it.
You know what weddings are like.

Where's Manolito?

-At home. He's looking great.
-What a funny guy.

Great party!

You've got some nerve.
I knew what you were up to.

You could see right through me!

-Serafín.
-Yeah?

-Does it hurt?
-Like hell, but who cares?

-Have you got a moment?
-Course, shoot.

No, but in private.

Sure.

Well, since I've graduated
I'm at a bit of a loose end.

I thought, seeing you've got
so many companies,

maybe I could work with you,
or for you.

Because I know a lot about law.

You can trust me, Serafín.

Well Gonzalo, that's something I've
been thinking about for a while.

You won't be my lawyer,
you'll be my right-hand man.

I used to push pills at weekends
in Valencia.

In Puzzle, Barbacoa, Baraca...

And now that...

I've given that up,
can I be your friend?

-What?
-OK.

Play soccer with you,
go for picnics,

to theme parks,
go to the beach,

maybe go mountain-climbing,
motorbike riding...

and... and...

and...

and...

and hang out...

and to discos with girls...

and...

Will you dance with me?

Not now, my knee's
swollen up like that.

You want a separation, don't you?

You don't love me

and you don't want
to have a child with me.

We could have been so happy,
like a normal family:

dad, mum...

But you don't love me,
you don't love us.

We haven't even decided if the
nursery should be public or private.

Answer me please:

do you want a separation?

Private.

The private nursery.

Miguel, I'm going to see a lawyer.

A lawyer?

But you can come and see the kids
whenever you like.

Okay?

Right.

Well...

I'm going to sing a song
I composed. I've composed it.

No, Miguel, don't sing.

Don't make a fool of yourself
and of me...

That's enough. I'm going to sing.
I'm going to sing. That's enough!

Let me do something
for once in my life.

I love you a lot,
but you wear me out.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Aren't you going
to ask me to dance?

-I'm clumsy, but if you want...
-...to marry you.

What?

I want to marry you.
Have babies with you, buy a house...

Well, maybe a dance.

We were too late.

Hello, I'm Miguel Pichoto

and I'd like to sing a song
I composed especially for my friends

and for the newlyweds.

It goes something like this:

One, two, three.

<i>What is the question,</i>
<i>I know the answer...</i>

<i>Tell me</i>

<i>if I've found the doorway...</i>

I want to marry you, Jorge.

The Daniel thing was a mistake.
I was scared of marriage.

But I'm not any more.

You mind if we sit down a minute?

<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

It's the right thing to do.

I don't know.

I should be going.

My uncle said housing prices
are low. With my wage and yours...

Our families would help us.

I've got to go.

I've got to go.

I'm sorry.

This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

That guy's got talent.

He's really something.

<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

Jorge.

You left your stomach medicine.

Thanks.

Well, I'm going in.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

Are you OK?

You're a great singer, Miguel.

Thank you.

Look, Violeta,
my platonic girlfriend.

-You have more songs, don't you?
-One more, but...

Great.

Well, you give me 2,000 euros now

and I'll make you a star
in no time. I've even got a lawyer.

2,000 euros? I don't know...

I'll probably have to pay out
three times as much.

But don't thank me.
We'll both make a killing.

When I get a hunch, the bell rings.
And this'll be one hell of a bell.

Violeta.

What's wrong?

Aren't you going?

Maybe I rushed into things saying

we should get married, but...

since my uncle said
it was a good time to buy...

and if we ask for a loan
we could

buy ourselves a car...

We could look in Valdebernardo.
I heard it's cheap.

-And not too far away.
-No.

Up Elipa!

Come on, Jorge, we've fucking won.
Next year we're signing up again.

Come on,
let's see everyone dancing.

Change partners!

I can see the light...
