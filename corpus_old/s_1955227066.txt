Sexual psychopaths,
serial killers

Often torture the victims
first, revel in the power

They have over them.

Quite often they ejaculate
spontaneously without ever

Achieving penetration.

They are that hopped
up by their own evil.

They are that hopped
up by hands-on evil,

Just touching their victims.

Sex is sex.

Everybody wants sex.

The old joke from
the 1950s was, I

Want to find the
guy who invented sex

And ask him what
he's working on now.

It's the big deal in life.

It is the cause of divorce,
the cause of murder.

It is the cause
of serial murder.

Homosexual men kill homosexual
men and heterosexual

Men kill women.

It goes like that.

That's it.

You kill within
your racial profile.

You kill within your
sexual orientation profile.


Hey, pick him up.

Let's fuck with this dude.


Yo, hey.

Make him run.

Make him run, make him run.

[Interposing voices]

Why are you taking my picture?

Why is he taking my picture?

Hey, by the way, you
need to put your foot

Out and hold this still.

Drag your feet.

You guys aren't cops, are you?

No.

No, we're the Demon Dogs, man.

You never know.

Demon dogs?

[Interposing voices]

What are you doing?

Where are you guys headed?

We're going to shoot this
fucking video for this movie.

Independent film, which
means no money, basically.

Sorry, man.

Sorry.

[Interposing voices]

Good luck.

Keep your pants on.

Serial killers are
sexual psychopathics

Who kill for sexual
gratification and power

Over their victims.

They are cowardly,
they are weak.

They are quite often
heedless and tremendously

Arrogant to think that
they have the right

To take another human life.

Serial killers are sacks of shit
who deserve the very sternest

Measures that our American
punitive system of justice

Has to offer.

Hi, hepcats.

I'm James Ellroy.

I'm a novelist,
I'm a journalist,

I'm short story writer,
I'm a screenwriter,

And I'm here to introduce
Ben Meade's Bonnaroo

Film about sex, psychopathic,
and serial killer Bob

Berdella, who
terrorized Kansas City,

Missouri in the late 1980s.

[Suspenseful music playing]



It was from this
second floor room

That Chris Bryson escaped on the
Saturday before Easter, 1988.

He was wearing nothing
but a dog collar.

He told police of his
unbelievable torture,

And the worn marks
on a steel bed.

You jumped from there?

Yeah, I think my leg's
broken or something.

And you were there
the whole time?

Yeah.

Tell me how you got there.

CHRIS BRYSON

Hanging out at Joseph's
down at 10th and McGee,

You know, having a beer.

This guy pulls up in a car.

I started talking
to him, you know.

He wants to party.

I meet guys like that
all the time down there.

INVESTIGATOR (PORTRAYAL): Yeah?

CHRIS BRYSON (PORTAYAL):
So I figure I'll

Go to the party with the guy.

What the hell?

He seemed harmless enough.

Catch a good buzz.

Maybe get some cash out of him.

INVESTIGATOR (PORTRAYAL):
OK, so you've

Ever seen this guy before?

CHRIS BRYSON (PORTAYAL):
I don't think so.

These kind of guys, they
come down there all the time.

We get to the house,
everything seems cool.

Inside was a fucking mess,
man, shit everywhere.

He has these two big fucking
dogs inside there, too.

He asked me if I wanted
a beer and I said cool.

He said we'd have to
go upstairs to keep

The dogs from going crazy.

I'm not sure what
happened next, but I know

My fucking head hurt like hell.

Next thing I know, I'm
tied to this fucking bed

Totally naked,
goddamn dog collar

And leash around my neck.

The son of a bitch is
taking pictures of me.

I remember he took a lot
of fucking pictures of me.

Shit, man.

INVESTIGATOR (PORTRAYAL): What?

CHRIS BRYSON (PORTAYAL):
He beat the shit out of me.

He put shit in my eyes.

Shocked the hell out of me.

He injected Drano
into my voice box.

He screwed me all
the fucking time.

INVESTIGATOR (PORTRAYAL):
He raped you?

CHRIS BRYSON (PORTAYAL):
While I was drugged

And tied up and shocked?

Yeah, he raped me.

When did you meet this guy?

Monday night, sometime
after midnight.

Monday night?

Yeah.

What day is it today?

Saturday.

NARRATOR: Bryson got free by
burning his bonds with matches

And making a lucky leap from
the second floor window,

Trailing a leash
from the dog collar.

Had Bryson not escaped, his fate
could have been in the bathroom

Above the torture chamber.

UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Whenever he got
tired of his "project," which

In this case was
dismembering this young man,

He'd just leave it,
secure the door,

Go down and take care
of normal activities

And actually come back
to it, like it was a job.

NARRATOR: Police
found two skulls,

But no other body parts.

Sometimes the job took
Berdella to the basement.

He had a drain, a floor
drain down here, and a lot

Also against the wall
there, there's a shower.

There's some
plumbing over there,

And there's a spigot up there.

He could take a shower,
hose down everything with.

This big, sturdy
table... well, he could

Use it for lots of purposes.

[Music playing]

marching home today,

But Bobby was not the same.

Blood on life's battlefield,
it messed up Bobby's brain.

Bobby didn't like women,
Bobby had no friends.

Bobby prowled the
streets all night,

Just waiting for it to end.

He's a fallen soldier, like
a tombstone on the road.

Fallen soldier, his
story's waiting to be told.

Fallen soldiers.

In the mirror he sees me
sees me throwing people.

That's the only thing he sees.

Let's start talking because
you can edit however.

You can just take
whatever out you want.

I was 15, 16 years old.

I got my first girlfriend.

We've go to Bob's
Bazaar on the weekends.

She bought me my first
ring there, I believe.

I thought it was pretty cool.

We thought Bob was cool.

We were young and dumb,
but he seemed exotic.

He seemed like some sort of
world traveler, eclectic.

I'd see his masks and his
jewelry and I'd think Bombay,

I'd think Africa, and I guess
that's not the story, is it?

[Suspenseful music playing]

I had met Bob before.

I knew Al Riederer, who was
the prosecuting attorney.

I contacted Al Riederer and
said, Al, can I be of help?

And this is something
that I'm concerned about.

I was particularly
concerned with the attitude

The city took... a
lot of laughing,

A lot of Berdella jokes,
making fun of what he had done,

Which was one of
the worst crimes

I'd ever seen in this city or
that anybody could possibly do.

And I felt that something had
to be done to call attention

To the seriousness of the crime
and to try to deal with it,

To respond to it.

And so my role initially
was to approach Al.

I said, if I can be of help,
let me know, and he said OK.

Bob is sort of suicidal.

We want to keep him alive.

We want to understand
what happened.

We'll have you visit him
once or twice a week,

But you have to keep it
quiet, and we'll put you

In the back door of the jail.

We won't tell anybody you're
visiting him because you'll

Probably have some
death threats if anybody

Knows you're coming in.

It was pretty odd.

Number one, it was
Easter weekend.

It was on the Saturday
before Easter,

So not something you
were particularly

Looking for to happen.

It was in the middle of
the NCAA Final Four, which

Was in Kansas City that year.

And it was in the
middle of my reelection.

It played into my reelection
because the person

Who ran against me that year
kept bringing up the case

And using it in the
campaign against me.

I think it kind of
backfired on her,

But it became part of the
campaign nevertheless.

So the timing of it
was truly unusual.

I would love to
see him executed.

I think what he
did is abominable.

There is no way to
minimize the atrocity

Of what he did, regardless
of what his demeanor is

In the interview.

You cannot minimize
the inhumanity this

Guy committed on other people.

My initial thought
what was that it was

A couple of homosexuals who had
probably had a lovers' quarrel

And that it would play itself
out like many other cases

Do that start out
in a similar nature.

I was in charge of the fugitive
apprehension that handled

Missing persons,
and at the time,

There were two missing
persons reports filed.

In both those missing persons
reports, the common denominator

At that time was Bob Berdella.

I was the courts reporter,
Jackson County courts,

For the Kansas City Times, and
so I heard the announcement.

I knew it was going to
be coming up on my beat.

Tom Jackman was
cops, I was courts.

It was pretty much our ballgame.

Bob's base of
operations during the day

And where he came
when he had guys tied

To his bed in his house was
right there at the Westport

Flea Market Bar & Grill.

He had this booth called Bob's
Bizarre Bazaar, where he sold

Just a lot of weird
stuff... shrunken heads,

Bone jewelry,
paintings, antiques.

He considered himself this
sort of man of the world that

Was bringing in all these
incredible valuables to you,

The lowly public, and
people that shopped there

Are always talked about what
a condescending dickhead

He could be.

I started collecting
and dealing

In ethnic folk art back in '71.

And then in '78, I came over
here to basically temporarily

Clean out my basement.

I had a basement sale
to clean out my house,

And then I came over here
to clean out my basement.

It just did very well.

I started bringing
over some of the stuff

That I was dealing in as far
as the ethnic jewelry and folk

Art.

The weekend that
Berdella was caught,

The NCAA basketball
Final Four was

Being played in Kansas City.

Now, Bob couldn't give
a damn about basketball,

But he did want to capitalize
on all the hype and all

The tourists, so he
put four human skulls

In the window there with
a little sign beneath it

Said "The Final Four."

[Music playing]

I made a mistake.

That's what I
thought at the time.

I knew that this was for real
when I was up in that bed.

I thought about my
kids and I thought

About that stupid-ass
decision that I had made.

And it was a real hard one.

[Music playing]

They were young white males
who we suspect most of them

Were involved in
male prostitution.

We don't know that
about all of them,

But clearly they
were particularly

The ones you picked up off of
the street where some of those

Were involved in
male prostitution.

What's interesting to me
is that with respect to all

Of these people,
he turned what he

Saw as a slight against
himself into a vendetta

Against the individual,
a vendetta so terrible

That it was worth killing for.

And it was clear
from the confession

That he had sexual designs
on all of these people.

OK, it's Berdella's
confession now.

I don't want no fucking around.

Just go in there and
tale care of him.

I don't want no fucking around.

First of all, his name isn't
"Bordello," it's Berdella.

It's an Italian name, shithead.

Excuse me, I'm sorry.

Please raise your right hand.

Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing

But the truth, so help you God?

Yes.

[Suspenseful music playing]

I think that he had a
longstanding love affair

With the male anatomy
and like a little kid

Playing with an erector
set or playing with one

Of those models
of the human body,

He wanted to find
out what was inside.

In other words, it's the
ultimate objectification

Of another human being.

We got woken up yesterday
at the crack of dawn

With the sound of heavy
machinery digging in the yard

Next door and we thought,
what the heck is going on?

And then it came out
in the news that day

That they had found skeletal
remains buried in the back yard

Of our neighbor Bob Berdella.

I don't know.

You seemed like a
good enough neighbor.

He was a quiet guy,
but I can tell you

From everyone I've talked to, he
just always smelled really bad.

My first reaction
that this was a biggie

Was when we dug the head up
out of the backyard on Easter

Sunday.

That's what it
really first hit me

And I knew then that we
had a major investigation

On our hands and I
probably was going

To be in the middle of it.

[Suspenseful music playing]

Well, the way I got
involved with Bob Berdella

Is I'd done a lot of
investigative reporting

For national
magazines, including

A book called Assassination
in America, and I was local.

So they were looking for someone
with a criminal background,

Knew how to ask questions,
do that sort of thing.

And I was contacted and
conducted a whole bunch

Of audio interviews with
Berdella for the Jackson County

Jail as preparation
for the video interview

That we eventually did with him.

Mr. Berdella,
you're sitting here

As a man who's going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

You've confessed to the murder
of six young men in this city

And crimes that horrified the
city and much of the country.

You've confessed to various
degrees, felonious restraint,

Drugging people,
sexually abusing

Them, torturing them, killing
them, dismembering them.

And until now, you've
refused all interviews.

So in light of all
those facts, I have

To ask you why you're here.

What is it you
have to say to us?

What is it you want to say
about yourself in this case?

Well, I've had the media
clamoring to get interviews

With me and after I
made my last pleas,

I wanted to get at least
part of my side of it out.

I find it very hard to find any
way to do that in Kansas City.

The media has so biased
my case, portraying me

As being non-human,
and their motivation

Is no separate from the
way I treated my victims.

I treated them as
something less than human,

Nothing more than a play
toy or a play object.

This is what the
media has done to me.

It's dehumanized me so
that it can believe,

Along with the public, that
things like human sacrifice,

Satanism, demonic practices are
more believable than me being

The neighbor next door
reached a point in his life

Where he could do
monstrous acts.

That's not the same
thing as being a monster.

That's preposterous
and the most

Convoluted logic
and most specious

Logic on God's green Earth.

He wanted to kill.

He wanted to continue to kill.

Had he not been apprehended,
had the police been asleep

At the wheel when his
last victim escaped,

Which was what caused
him to be arrested,

He'd still be out there killing
people at 55, 56 years of age

Now.

[Blues music playing]


In the '80s, within about
a two- or three-year period,

He had been in the
emergency room at Truman

On several occasions to have the
head of his penis reattached.

It's easy to reattach.

You can just sew the skin
and maybe some of the blood

Vessels, but the nerve endings
may not grow through again,

So they may not have the same
kind of sensation, you know?

So it's just dead at
the tip, I would think,

At least after two or
three tries of this.

And so I said it always made
me very curious that perhaps

The kinds of things that he
had done to these young men

Were not so much about
lust or sexual sensation

As they were simply about power
because I don't think he had

That kind of feeling
left in his penis

After two or three operations.

[Music playing]

I was driving to my
flower shop the morning

He had been arrested, or at
least that the story came out,

And I heard that he
had been arrested

For some really hideous crimes.

And I don't remember how
much I heard at the time,

And I was really shocked.

My first thought was
that the cops are just

Out to get another gay man.

I had been gay bashed
a few years previously,

And when I went
to press charges,

The cops told me that
if I press charges,

I would be arrested for
having propositioned this man.

So I had to let the man
go in order to myself

Not be prosecuted for
homosexual activity.

Just all I'd done is
propositioned him.

And so when I heard
about Bob Della,

My first thought
was from knowing him

And from talking with him and
everything, this could not be.

This just simply could not be.

They're just out to
frame another gay man

And that that's all it was.

Bob would make these
appointments for these boys

That he had been made
the court guardian for,

And they were supposedly runaway
kids, hustler, problem kids,

And he was supposedly
trying to get

Them spiffed up so that they
could go out and get a job.

And so he was
supposed to be trying

To lead him into doing that.

Well, so Bob would
make appointments

For the boys' haircuts to be
done by my friend Larry, who

Owned the shop, and then he
would make an appointment

With me for me to cut his hair.

So I would cut Bob's hair and
Larry would cut these, we would

Say, little future corpses.

I lived at Berdella's house
off and on for about six months,

And I worked for him
at his flea market.

He would give me Valiums.

And then sometimes then
I would ask him for them,

But most the time I think he
was trying to force them to me.

And at that time, I did
drink and things like that.

He never really hurt
me that I ever knew of,

And he always helped me.

There was a picture of me on
TV along with a few other men

At the time, and the victims.

It was a real dilemma for
me because I was listening

To these hideous stories about
this man and what he had done,

And this was the man that I
had chatted with in my shop,

That we had sat there
and talked and talked

About all kinds of
things, and had,

Like I said earlier, real
kindred spirit going.

And so he threw me into a real
dilemma... the whole experience

In terms of looking at this man
and looking at these horribly

Villainous acts, and at the
same time inside myself knowing

That this man was not all bad.

No matter what we told him,
he'd want to argue with us.

He'd come down.

We told him his alternator was
out once and he'd come down.

He had to check it out himself
and he wanted to argue with us.

So after he did that five or
six times, we ran him off.

We got tired of
listening to his shit.

And I used to run into him.

I used to eat up at the flea
market up in Westport fairly

Routinely, and I'd run
into his sick ass up there.

Found out later on what he
was doing to them young kids.

And my little brother was in
the police academy at the time,

So we'd get home, on
the 6 o'clock news

There's my brother
digging for bones and body

Parts in Berdella's backyard.

I'm glad the sick son of a bitch
got what was coming to him.

[Somber music playing]

We're now at 4315
Charlotte Street.

This is where Bob
Berdella lived and where

At least six people died.

[Suspenseful music playing]

Your prosecutors, and I do want
to quote this, when you came

To plead, called your crimes
"wantonly vile, horrible,

Or inhuman."

When was this done?

I believe in
documents associated

With the Sheldon charges.

To repeat that quote
from the prosecution,

"These crimes were wantonly
vile, horrible, or inhuman."

OK, I think if you'll check
with just about any attorney,

You'll find that that is
the standard clause that's

Used when they want to
build a case for capital one

With the death penalty.

Without the legalism, would
you agree that those crimes

Are wantonly vile or inhuman?

I won't disagree.

Well, I've been talking
about the torture pretty much.

I was awake through
most of that.

This one time when he
hooked these cables up

To my testicles, I was naked.

I'm not aware of
what he's doing.

He stepped back and he
touched his wires together,

And I flipped and
flopped all over the bed,

That kind of woke me up.

He shocked me.

He was electrocuting me
and at the same time,

He was taking Polaroid pictures.

And at that time, I just
fake passed out after he

Turned it off and he was done.

And then he came immediately and
put a potato sack over my head

And kind of closed it like
that, so my hands were tied here

And my feet were tied.

And I breathed through
my mouth, and he

Already had the rag
stuffed in my mouth

And tied with piano wire.

And I wasn't able to
get no oxygen at all.

So I was more or less
in this position,

And I was trying to rip
the potato sack off,

And that's when he
came in, and that's

When he flew into... he
just ripped that thing off

And he came and just
jumped on my chest.

He had an iron bar like that.

And he just... he was trying
to strike me in the head

And it seemed like it was
for about five minutes.

And I was like this, and he
was trying to hit my head.

And more or less, I
was deflecting them

All with my hands and stuff.

When he got done with that,
he disappeared for a while.

He came back in and he started
digging this... I thought it

Was clothes pin or something.

He was digging in my ears, he
was just stabbing in my ears.

That was one of the scariest
things that he had done,

Jamming in my ears.

I didn't get no
injuries from that.

I don't see how.

Then he disappeared again.

He came back and he injected a
hypodermic needle in my throat

All around the vocal
cords with Drano.

He took some Q-tips.

He came back in and he
stabbed them in my eye

With some bleach.

He had the Q-tips
with some bleach

And he was stabbing
them in my eyes.

After he did all that, I
was pretty much messed up

And I think he injected me with
some more antibodies up there.

During the next couple
days, I was sick.

I was getting...
Pneumonia was setting in.

This is what he told me.

I just knew I was dying.

He said he wanted to
put me in a cold bath

So he could break the
fever, all this crap.

He was injecting me with
penicillin in my legs

To make sure... I
think he was trying

To keep me alive for
a while at that point.

I think his intention with the
torture was to break your will

And you would just not
give him no problems.

The only time I ever got up,
he would allow me to get up,

Was when I had to go to the
bathroom and do a number two.

OK.

In the bed, is what he said.

And when I had to
take a bath one time.

And he wanted me
to shave one time.

My eyes had swollen
up like golf balls.

I couldn't see out of my
eyes and I couldn't talk,

And my arms were at
least twice the size

From being no movement in them,
there was no blood flow in them

Like that.

It's hardly to be a man and say
shit happened to you like that,

So really what
bought me a couple

Times from his sexual
shit was just passing

Out, acting like I was so sick.

I'm not trying to
say he had a heart,

But I guess he just didn't
want me to die at the time.

Well, like Joseph
Mengele and the people

In the concentration
camps during World War II,

He was an experimenter.

He experimented with
caustic chemicals,

Shot the young
male prostitutes up

With Drano in the vocal cords
to see if he could mute them,

And he took hundreds of
photographs of them, Polaroids,

And these were... of course, he
couldn't go to your local One

Hour Speedy Print and get them
developed without condemning

Himself... but these were
there for purposes of savoring

And purposes of
masturbation, and it gave

Him a sense of accomplishment.

Also he knew damn well he
couldn't go out and kill

Every day, that the hammer
would fall much quicker than it

Finally did, so this
was a way for him

To relieve, to relive, the
torture of his victims.

After Berdella got
these guys in his house

And in his bedroom, he basically
had intercourse with them

By whatever means possible.

And he would at times
photograph himself

In the act of having anal
intercourse with somebody

Or forcing them to
give him a blow job.

He sodomized them with his fist,
with a cucumber, with a carrot,

And he noted all these things.

That's how we know this,
is because he made notes

In his notes of what position he
took when he was screwing them,

Whether it was BF for butt
fuck or FF for front fuck

Or SF for side fuck or CF for
carrot fuck or cucumber fuck.

It was pretty amazing stuff.

Another report was that
you kept have detailed

Torture logs and diaries.

Did you?

I kept sheets of paper that
I had made some notations on.

This is between the mattress
and springs on my bed.

This is one of those
packages containing

Innumerous photographs
and what became

To be known as meticulous
methodical diaries.

Those pieces of paper in there
are these meticulous diaries.

These are the pictures of
more than 200 photographs, some

Of them young men,
sexual partners,

And these are in
some ways... and these

That we see here are
the sheets of paper

Upon which you made notes.

Right.

This is a copy of
one of those pages.

But it looks like
a loose-leaf paper.

It does contain
information about amounts

Of drugs and so on, so what is
your complaint with the police

Calling these detailed diaries?

By your evaluation, does
this look methodical?

Doesn't look methodical.

Meticulous?

It looks a little sloppy.

They are not bound in
Corinthian leather, written

On parchment diaries
that the media apparently

Tries to describe them ass.

They're sheets of paper.

They're notes.

[Music playing]

Berdella's a homosexual and he
practiced sodomy on his victims

With his fist, with
various vegetables,

And the pain must've
been excruciating.

And although I don't believe
in the death penalty per se,

I almost wish it
could be stretched

To fry guys like Berdella.

Of course, he's dead now.

Died of a heart
attack back in prison.

So like, yeah.

I'm glad he's dead.

He was a piece of shit.

He was without
redeeming social value.

It may be, even though
closure's a fatuous concept that

Never occurs for any victim
or relative of a victim

Or loved one of a
victim, I'd like

To think that he's
suffering right now

And that the Prince
of Darkness has

A poker straight up his ass.

[Suspenseful music playing]

It's entirely
true that Berdella

Killed marginal people.

He killed people
who were vulnerable,

Who were vulnerable
to drugging, who

Were vulnerable to being
lured to a secret spot

And then killed.

Had he been a
child killer, there

Would've been considerably
more police attention

On this very, very early.

And I think part of the reason
that there was no outrage

Was because the young men
involved work for the most

Part male prostitutes.

They were from broken homes.

They left home.

They didn't have a community
around them to protest,

And so the media and
the public in general

Did not attach the same
value to those lives

That it would have
if it had been

Somebody out of old-line,
Kansas City blue-blood family.

If that had been the case,
different response altogether.

But because they were
prostitutes for the most part,

Because they were runaways,
because they didn't have

Families with any
political clout,

Not a lot of
seriousness, I felt,

Was attached to
the actual crimes.

That's not true.

That's not true.

The two individuals... they
were individuals as far as I'm

Concerned... they were missing.

The common denominator
was Bob Berdella,

And we tried to go
after Bob Berdella.

We didn't sit back
because these people

Had some kind of history.

We pursued it, and that
is a falsehood there.

I have never known just
because of their race, sex,

Their sexual origin,
religion, or whatever

To sit back and say, just
throw that on the back burner.

That has never, ever been
done to my knowledge.

It was never done
while I was there.

I can't think of a thing we
would've done any differently.

It would've maybe been easier
if they had been people of more

Prominence because we would
have had privy to more relatives

And close associates
than what we did.

Maybe people who had more
background information on them

Because a couple of
our victims, we really

Had no one to turn to as
far as trying to find out

Information from their past.

None of them came from higher
up on the socioeconomic scale,

I suppose, to say...
All of them were

Either from working families.

In this case, young
homosexual prostitutes

Should have been told after the
first two victims disappeared,

Be very, very careful, or
better yet, Jesus Christ,

Don't be a homosexual
prostitute.

It's a losing proposition
any way you slice it.

I was not a male prostitute.

I was addicted to
drugs at the time.

His line was, you get high?

His line was, you get high?

I got some Valiums at the
time he had cigarette money.

And so I'm thinking,
well, what can it mean.

I can go work for this
dude for something.

If you looked at
Bob Berdella, he

Didn't look... he
didn't look gay,

So it wasn't even
nothing like going on.

And at that time, I had the
choice to go... to get dropped

Off, maybe, or to go that way.

So unfortunately I
took the wrong way.

Never met the man, thank God.

Never needed to, to write
a song about him, at least.

That's what I did back then.

I was a radio guy.

I was a disc jockey.

I was irreverent.

I was unfeeling.

Whatever was funny
went on the radio.

How did you feel
when you learned

That not long after your arrest,
the local radio stations, two

Of them at least, were running
a Bob Berdella parody song

And were asking people come to
parties wearing dog collars?

Well, I think the
newspaper article

Reported that even the
families of the victims

Were upset by the song.

I have never had a
chance to hear the song.

I was sitting at Antoine's on
the Boulevard, the old Tony's,

And having lunch and
thinking that this

Was such a huge
story in Kansas City

That I had to write something.

There was some song in the
classic rock era that would fit

It perfectly, and I'll be
damned if I over a little $3.75

Steak lunch figure out
"They call me Bob Berdella."

Instead of "Mellow Yellow,"
it became "Bob Berdella."

Everything just fit in.

It had everything with
the bones in the backyard

And the fluoroscope in the
basement and all the Polaroid

Photographs that he had and
the hitchhikers and the dog

Collars and the electric
shocks and the needles

Sticking out of their necks.

You had so much to write
from, you couldn't help

But come up with something.

me Bob Berdella.

That's right.

They call me Bob Berdella.

Do it again.

They call me Bob Berdella.

Don't stick that hand.

I had also been told when
I first came into jail

That the Fox radio station
had run a promo giving prizes

To their listeners
if they showed

Up at the station in a dog
collar and with a leash on.

The people here in
the institution...

The correctional
officers, the caseworker,

Even the psychiatrist...
Were, I think,

Surprised to find out
that that upset me.

And it did upset you?

Very much so.

[Music playing]

I had been in Ethiopia
the year before and I'd

Gone through the camps and
I'd seen the dying children.

I'd seen death.

I'd seen evil in a
social sense, and I

Had felt that somehow it
had a positive impact on me

As a person.

So I entered into
this arrangement

With Bob in which I met with
him for an hour, hour and a half

Twice a week, and I thought
I could handle anything.

I didn't realize the impact.

I was not able to eat, not
able to have sex, lost weight,

Became extremely withdrawn
because I was dealing

With stuff and then I was told
this is stuff you can't tell

Other people about because
it's pretty... that's not

The type of stuff
you could go out

And say, hey, let me
tell you about what

Bob and I talked about today.

You had to keep it under wraps,
and that was the agreement.

So my wife and I did
not talk about it.

I didn't realize the
impact it was having

Except over a period of time,
six months, I had gotten down

And maybe lost 20
pounds and was just sort

Of like a castaway that
had fallen on hard times

And I was just skin and bones.

After Berdella went to prison,
I got an interview with him.

They put me in this
little tiny room with him.

I asked them to take
the handcuffs off.

I'm not sure why, but I did.

He didn't seem very
threatening at that point.

It's like all the air
had been let out of him.

His condition was
that I bring two tape

Recorders, one to tape the
interview for myself, one

To give him a tape.

I had to ask him how he got
by with some of this stuff

Because there were
plenty of indications

That there were
some nasty things

Going on in Berdella's house.

He told me that there were some
judges who would send people

To him and that he
often bonded people out,

And that for a while the
parole board had considered

Him someone where they
could send troubled youth

And young adults.

I was recording
the conversation.

After I left, the
tapes were confiscated

And the warden called me and
informed me that something was

Wrong with my tape
recorder because they

Couldn't get the tape to play
after they'd confiscated it.

I went to interview
Marcia Walsh.

She'd just gotten back from
a trip to the Arctic Circle

Where she'd been
saving baby seals.

She really couldn't
tell me much about why

She thought that Berdella
was a drug counselor

Or that sort of thing.

[Music playing]

You recall I mentioned
before that there were reports

In the Westport Flea Market
where you had your shop

That people would
say, oh, yes, I

Do remember he had these
strange-smelling dishes of

Food, that he had bead bones.

And later on there were
speculations, at least

In the community and in
some aspects of the media,

That the remains of
your victim were somehow

Being transported
and prepared as meals

And prepared as
jewelry in your shop.

I was quickly able to
identify to the police

The other dealers in that
section of the market where

We rotated potluck, rather than
eat the flea market food again.

And that you could question
any of these people,

They'd be able to tell you
that the food was good,

There was nothing suspect
about the turkey or ham or beef

That was in these dishes.

[Music playing]

They were at the flea market
by Bob's Old Bazaar Bizarre.

Bob was kind of a sick
guy who got a little too

Into his hobbies, head hunting,
cannibalism, and cooking,

And I think cooking
saved his life, actually.

[Music playing]

It's one thing to have one
guy dabbling in cannibalism

In your small town.

It's another to have
scores of people.

[Music playing]

Bob had chili at
his Bazaar Bizarre

That he'd occasionally served.

I think it had people in them.

Odd guy.

It got him off of the
lethal injection, though.

He was a sick boy.

[Music playing]

He would cut the bodies up
using his expertise as a chef

And bring them out here
to the curb on Monday

Morning and monitor it from his
window to make sure the trash

Men took the trash
away, and that

Was his method of disposing
of the bodies of the men

That he killed.

Bob Berdella was a
real landfill Louis.

To think that he put
pieces of a human being out

In the trash for trash
men to collect on Mondays

Is astounding.

All they had to do was catch
the scent of decomposing flesh

Or look inside and realize that
there was a chopper inside.

[Circus music playing]

I was very suspicious
about the landfill,

Putting the bodies
out with trash.

It just it didn't sound in
character, not to mention

The problems that would cause.

How secure is that, to put
a body out on your curb

In a plastic bag?

You wrap stuff up and
put it out on the curb,

You never know whether it's
going to be torn apart by dogs

Or hit by a car.

He seems like a more careful
person to me than that.

I believe it was the
police department who called

And said that they needed us.

They needed us to appraise a
piece of residential property

That they can't
tell us what it is,

But they'll have a car there
in five minutes to pick us up.

We had no idea where we were
going or what we were doing.

We end up at Bob
Berdella's house.

Dining room had some
weird stuff in there...

Coffee table with some
weird pictures on it

And screaming faces,
that sort of thing.

Vicious dogs in cages right
outside the back door.

Huge dog kennels,
chain-link fence kennels.

They weren't little dog runs
for Spot to run through.

These were secured enclosures.

They were not couch potato dogs.

These were huge dogs.

Kitchen was really strange.

A couple big stainless
steel commercial tables.

First you figure
out the guy could've

Been a chef at a restaurant.

I knew of Bob
Berdella, but didn't

Know... nobody knew this stuff.

So you thought, OK, he's
got dinner parties, caters.

Who knows what?

But then you look around
and it just wasn't right.

It wasn't a normal kitchen.

It wasn't a kitchen you
were going to entertain in.

One of the stainless
steel tables

Had built-in sinks and
this huge garbage disposal.

It was a large... never seen a
garbage disposal that large.

What the hell else is
he going to do with it?

He's not going to grind
up lettuce in that thing.

Basically the food or waste
enters from the top down

Onto the grind plate, which
was spinning at the time

The food enters the machine.

The food is propelled by these
teeth here along the side,

Or against the side rather,
of the shredder unit, which

Pulverizes the waste, forcing it
through these cutting chambers

Into the grind chamber where
the waste exits the machine.

I don't know much
about human bones

And what they look like when
they're out of the body,

But I would figure
they'd be pretty large

And as you can see, the grind
chamber's not exactly huge.

So if you want a bone
to come down here,

And let's say it was this
big, it lodges in here.

Machine starts, it grabs
that bone, jams it real quick

Because in this
area of the machine,

It's not going to
grind that bone,

Take it on, and rip it up.

It's going to jam and stop.

The flesh would not
be a problem at all.

It would rip it up and
send it on down the drain

Line pretty easily.

I do see hospitals use them,
unfortunately, to grind things.

I have seen some
labs use them to get

Rid of tumors and whatnot.

[Suspenseful music playing]

Men will go to any
length to get head

Is my only comment on this.

You said, "I want the police
to explain why they allow"

The loved ones of families
to die in the convenient area

"Of 10th and McGee."

I don't think any
family of my victims

Or anybody else that has
been killed, related to 10th

And McGee are going to be happy
to find out that their loved

One is basically written
off by the police

As far as investigations go,
et cetera, because they died

In a convenient neighborhood.

The police knew what was
going on, so it's no big deal.

And that accounts
for your remark to me,

And I don't mean at
all to make light of it

That "I killed six,
but they, the police",

By allowing this to stay
open, they killed more."

Yes, this has been
something that's

Been going on for over
20 years to my knowledge.

It seems to me that you're
suggesting that had the police

Done their job, had they
followed the leads, had they

Really been on your case
prior to April 2, 1988,

They would've caught you
and some of the suffering

Could have been prevented.

Maybe not caught me...
Scared me off, maybe.

Prevented things from happening
after Howell, definitely.

In a way, do you wish they had?

Yes.

Well, it was the police's fault
because they should've caught

Me, or they should
stop having all

Those attractive little
boys down there tempting me,

It was like nothing has
anything to do with... he

Had no responsibility at all.

It was just like,
well, I was on a diet

But you kept shoving
food down my throat.

It's like, oh, OK.

Six victims for a serial killer
over a four-year period is low.

Generally their urge to kill is
much more frequently than that,

But I think that
Berdella was a hoarder.

He spent a lot of
time with his victims.

He needed his residence
to house them.

He needed a safe
house to perform

His hideous experiments,
so I don't see him

As a roadside picker-up
of young men, a guy

Like, well, William
Bonin, the Freeway Killer

Here in Los Angeles.

I don't see him as
that kind of guy.

I think six may be the total.

That question was
always there and I

Was always being asked that.

I have no specific information
that there were other victims

That could have been.

At times I had some
thoughts that might've been,

But Bob certainly never
indicated that he had

Misled anyone in his testimony.

Personally I believe there
were only six victims.

A lot of people
disagree with that.

I think one of the
things that convinces

Me is the fact that Berdella
had already cut a deal,

So his punishment was
not going to be any

Different if it were 6 or 60.

When you look at the
research on serial killers,

They don't kill fewer
people over time.

They go up, and he went down.

I also thought it was odd that
they would find two skulls.

Like I say, he's a collector.

He collects everything.

If you look at those
search warrants,

This man didn't
throw anything away,

So why would you keep two skulls
and then just load every bit

Of every other body up
and put it out on the curb

For the trash to pick up?

I don't think I can accept that.

[Jazz music playing]

I can tell you what
led up to the escape.

Like I said, the first couple
days, I was unconscious

And I couldn't
really see nothing.

I didn't really know if
my eyesight was coming

Or what was going to happen.

I couldn't move my arms.

They were totally numb.

And I just didn't know what
this dude had up his sleeve,

But I did know at this time that
he was not going to let me go.

I don't go to church every
Sunday, but I believe in God

And I did call on him.

I don't really take no
credit for anything.

I kind of more or less
put things in his hands.

He had my hands tied to where
if I tried to move around,

It would tighten.

And then when he got back,
there was real restriction,

Marks on your hands,
he'd know that you'd

Been trying to get away.

Plus another thing, he
turned the TV up so loud

And he go out of the
room, I didn't really

Know if he had left the house
or if he was watching me

To see what I was trying to do.

I believed everything he said.

He told me he had killed
before and he would again.

On the fourth day, being
as my hands were numb

And I was thinking I couldn't
no nothing with them,

I asked him if he ever
tied anybody's hands

Any differently.

I said, if you can tie my hands
and feel sure that I can't

Get away, could you tie them?

And he did, and he tied them
from... took them down from here

And tied them here.

I always waited two or three
hours after he was gone,

What I thought was two or three
hours, try to do anything.

I had tried playing with the
knots, I was moving the knots

And I got them off.

I knew that I'd get them
off, but it wasn't the time.

I didn't know.

So I was going to do it, at
that point... on the fourth day,

I had planned for the fifth
day I was going to do it

The next day, he went ahead
with the regular schedule.

He did everything.

Asked me if I had to go to
the bathroom, and I said no.

While I was talking
to him, he had

Some matches because he always
used to give me a cigarette

Right before he left.

He smoked a cigarette and he
always took the matches away,

And he was standing there and
he threw them down this time

By the table.

I kept his attention
talking to him,

Why he didn't run to pick
the matches up again.

I don't know why, but
that's what happened.

I already knew I was
going to have to burn

The ropes with the matches.

So after I got them
loose, I couldn't

Reach down to touch
my feet, with it,

But there was the bedpost.

There was a metal bedpost and
I was so freaked out in my head

That I thought he had
boobytrapped the metal.

You know what I'm saying?

I actually thought
I was going to get

Shocked or electrocuted if I
would try to test the metal.

That is why I burned the ropes.

And so I got that loose.

It was just like a fast panic.

I didn't know shit
about the window

Because the window was
covered by a big picture.

I didn't know if it
was going to open.

I didn't know if
he was downstairs.

I didn't know how
much time I had.

I really didn't even know how
high I was up or anything,

Or I surely would have
tried to look for my clothes

Before I went out.

The fear... once
I knew that I had

Committed to untying
the ropes, I just

Knew it was all or nothing.

And so the adrenaline
building, man.

I just got up,
raised the window,

And I was happy that
it came all the way up.

And I looked down.

All I remember seeing a dog dish
right there below on the side

And I was thinking, damn,
I'm going to jump down there

And get attacked by these dogs.

So I crawl out and I'm hanging.

I was going to try to
jump over to the fence.

The next yard appeared to be
about this far on the sidewalk.

It was all divided.

I was going to jump over to
the next... where the grass was.

I was going to try to
get a little sway going

And jump over
there, but the ledge

Broke and I fell straight down.

I hurt my leg a little bit,
but that wasn't nothing.

I dove over the fence.

I wasn't thinking about
being naked or nothing.

I was out of there.

[Music playing]


If I'd only turned
left instead of right.

Why you, the unlucky ones.

Could you have put
a better fight?

I'm Lazarus.

I'm back, boys.

What'd I miss while I was gone?

I'm in a mood.

I got my life back.

Hell, I even have my own song.

Yeah, I guess some
of us are just lucky.

I'm the one that got away.

Even an old, gay, broken
watch is right twice a day.

I'm Lazarus.

I'm the phoenix.

It's not my time to go.

So sit back, but don't relax.

Enjoy the rest of the show.

Are you saying you feel
remorse or that you've

Been misunderstood?

I'm not going to sit here
with my finger to my chin

And say nobody understands me.

Yes, there has been
a lot of remorse.

And he may well feel remorse,
but he has the remorse

Of a crook that got caught.

Aw, poor Bobby.

The world grieves for you.

The world reads that excerpt
from WH Auden's poem,

And I forget the title.

Maybe it's his most famous
poem, "September 1, 1939."

It goes something like this...

"I and the public know what
all schoolchildren learn,

Those to whom evil is
done Do evil and return."

Well, maybe somebody gave you a
few whacks in the head when you

Were a kid, but I
doubt if you were

Systematically
terrorized the way

You terrorized your victims.

You deserve no sympathy.

[Bell chiming]

There was a report in the
Sunday Kansas City Star

In December about
the dangers you

Might face after you
leave the Jackson County

Correctional Facility
and are moved

To another, larger prison.

How do you feel about
reports like that?

Do they make you anxious?

They give me some
reason for concern,

But one of the
reasons I'm concerned

Is that these were
not just reports.

These were digging out quotes
from unnamed prosecutors,

Implying that the inmates
down there are waiting

To get their hands on me.

I am at this point less
concerned about the inmates

Acting on their own as opposed
to the inmates... inmate...

Acting in response to maybe
some directive or coercion

From some police officers.

You think you're
being set up, perhaps?

Well, I think the Star and
Times since they haven't been

Able to get a court
to put me to death

Are now trying to get the
inmates to do it for them.

In a sense, he was killed
by the prison system.

I don't make those
kind of judgments,

And it would be like
a death sentence

That the prison system
probably took on

Instead of the judicial system.

But I wouldn't say
that was fitting.

According to his parents, his
mom, they withheld medication

And he died of a heart attack.

So the question was put to me by
several people who Bob had told

He was going to give
the complete story to

And were visiting him in prison,
didn't give the complete story

To, caught me and asked me
if I would lead an effort

To call for an
investigation and to condemn

The prison system for their
lack of responsiveness

To Ma's medication.

I did not do that.

It's not something at that
time I was willing to do, take

On the role of challenging
the prison system,

Because I could
understand in some ways

How Bob got himself in
that situation... very

Demanding, very difficult
in terms of trying

To make others feel
very small and himself

Being very important.

And I'm just guessing that the
guards in the prison system

Just said, you're not
going to control us.

And they withheld the
medication and he died.

I think probably unfortunate
because I don't think

He had in return for his life
given the testimony to Al

Riederer and admitted
what he'd done,

And so that guaranteed
him life in prison,

And it's not up to us
to make those decisions.

It should have been done.

What I said was at
the time that I thought

That even though he wasn't given
the death penalty, number one,

He would go to prison
for the rest of his life.

And number two, he'd die in
prison a lot sooner than he

Would if he were executed.

In Missouri, it takes us about
10 years to execute somebody.

I don't know how long
he was in prison,

But probably about six
years before he died.

And why?

I believe that was simply
that his behavior was

So uncontrollable and was
so bad towards anybody,

Towards everybody
that he encountered.

I just assumed that he
would do something in jail

That would get him killed.

Now, he died of a heart attack.

Was he murdered?

I don't know.

He got what he deserved.

I don't know how you
put an end to all that,

But the truth of
the matter is if you

Go back and look at the
facts, that's how he ended up.

He ended up getting
what he deserved.

It's really too bad that he
didn't live longer than he did

Because I think he was
getting... he was a control freak

And people were losing
interest in him.

And I think that had he lived,
sooner or later he would've

Given up more information.

I don't think he
could've helped himself.

I think he wanted the attention.

And you know the whole story
about how he died in jail.

Well, I don't know
the whole story.

I just know he died
of heart attack.

But the story everybody was
telling was that, OK, he

Probably was asking
for more potato chips

And he was cussing
out some guard,

And then he's like, oh, guard.

They're like, oh,
yeah, we'll be there.

We'll be there.

They just let him die.

It's like everybody
was like, well,

And they had to pay extra.

Supposedly they had
to pay extra to keep

Him isolated because
everybody would've

Wanted to have a piece of him.

[Music playing]

me like an anvil.

You beat me into the dawn.

Just you and me, no witnesses,
then it can't be wrong.

I shut your eyes.

Are you invisible?

No one will hear you scream.

Dead man walking,
no one's talking.

All that's left is your sting.

So pound out the demons.

The gatekeepers all turn away.

Sparks from the hammer,
this will be your last day.

Stave off the sunset, maybe
this darkness will cop a plea.

For whom does the
anvil toll, Bobby?

The anvil tolls for thee.

NEWS REPORTER: Just
a bunch of Earth

Is all that's left
of 4315 Charlotte,

But some people will
never forget the house,

Nor the man who lived here.

Bob Berdella, Kansas City's
most infamous serial killer,

Is dead.

He died in prison
after his victims

Were killed in his home.

Berdella confessed to
sexually and physically

Torturing six men here, but some
believe there were more victims

And hope digging up the house
might unearth some secrets.

That's why millionaire Del
Dunmire, who owns the property,

Had workers carefully
tear it down.

Private detective Ashley
Hurn was here in 1988

When the truth
came out, and he's

Been here for the
past five weeks

Making sure no other
bodies turned up.

He says the stairs to the
basement will be saved,

As well as this
drain, reportedly used

To carry away the blood
of Berdella's victims.

Well, this appears to be the
final chapter of the Berdella

Story, and no one
could be happier

Than those who live
on either side,

Who will split the property.

I did not see any attempt
of clergy, any attempt

Of politicians, attorneys,
police, to ever try and wrap

That up and say, here's what
happened, here's what it means,

Here's what we've
learned from it.

I guess I kind of
got obsessed with it.

I think a lot of us
did... me, the lawyers,

The other reporters, everybody.

And it was difficult
to let go of the case,

And at a certain point, I
just decided that's exactly

What I needed to do.

So I gathered boxes, boxes
of documents and notes

And tape-recorded interviews,
and one day I just took

All that, loaded
it up in the car,

And drove out to the city
landfill and dumped it.

When there are pieces of the
puzzle, put them together.

Facts don't diminish the myth
because we need the stories

And we even need the
stories of the "bad people"

As much as we need the
stories of the good people.

We need our heroes and
we need our villains,

And so the myth becomes the
real story then, not the facts.

I don't know how he does
it, but you get obsessed.

Here you are in Hawaii.

You flew all the
way here to pursue

This case for this movie, so I
think you can see that it kind

Of just sort of keeps going.

Bob Berdella
deserves no sympathy.

Bob Berdella got off easy
compared to his victims.

In the future, people,
be quiet, be cautious,

Be circumspect around
strangers, especially

If you're women, especially
if you're gay men and women.

They fit the victim profile.

Elderly people,
children, be cautious.

There's demons out there.

The odds are profoundly against
you ever running into someone

Like Bob Berdella, but
it pays to be cautious

Because these guys do exist.

I'm James Ellroy,
offering slag to throw

On the grave,
hopefully unmarked,

Hopefully remote, hopefully
untended, of Bob Berdella.

Thanks joining us.

[Music playing]

all you chillun', I

Got a story I want to tell.

It's about the
next-door neighbor,

A preacher's thorn in hell.

He's one sick bastard,
no one to pity.

Mr. And Mrs.
Berdella's boy, he's

The butcher of Kansas City.

Bazaar Bizarre, it's
getting kind of icky.

Bazaar Bizarre, sicky
sicky, sicky sicky.

Bob the Bogeyman, you don't
wake up from this dream.

He's Bob the Bogeyman, no
one can hear you scream.

Bob the Bogeyman, he'll
wipe your eyes clean.

He's big man Bob,
Bob the Bogeyman.

Say what?

Bob's chili was a
mighty manly mixer.

Herbs and spices,
but never any chicks.

Franks and beans,
a chunkier knife.

Tattoos taste great
was Dahmer's advice.

Chomp down, y'all.

Bazaar Bizarre.

Bazaar Bizarre.

Bob's Bizarre, real bizarre.

Woof, woof, hear
the demon dog bark.

He's got a 12-inch wanger
that glows in the dark.

eyes make it hard to see,

Some Drano in your throat
make it hard to scream,

And it would seem from the
collar around your neck

That your non-virgin ass
is about to get reamed.

Bludgeoned and pummeled
and raped and abused,

Cooking in a chili pot
is where they find you.

Ground up like goo and
crushed crackers, too,

You better rise up better
than a male prostitute.

[Rock music continues]


He's Bob the Bogeyman.

[Sinister laugh]

When he gives you
a Drano cocktail,

It makes it hard to holler.

He'll put you on a short leash,
make you wear Fido's collar.

Be careful of when
you tread upon

This slippery, sunny slope.

You'll wind up in
Bob's Bazaar Bizarre,

The place there is no hope.

Bazaar Bizarre

He's coming to get ya.

Who there?

Why, it's Bob the Bogeyman.

[Sinister laugh]

Hey now, Bob, wait a minute.

Oh, yeah, he's the Bogeyman.

He's going to get you.

He's going to get you.

Can I say get you one more time?

Say it one more time, get you.

Get your ya-ya's here.

What?

That's another
song, that's right.

Bob the Bogeyman.

Bob the Bogeyman.

Who?

Bob the Bogeyman.

He's Bob the Bogeyman.

He's Bob the Bogey, the
Bogey, the Bogeyman.
