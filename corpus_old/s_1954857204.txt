Nice talkin' to you too.
Okay. Take care.

<i>I'll bet none of us knew when we
woke up on what we all thought...</i>

<i>Was just another spring day, that
a stranger had come to our town.</i>

<i>Who was he?
Where did he come from?</i>

<i>Why did he come here? We may
never quite know the answers,</i>

<i>why did he come here? We may
never quite know the answers,</i>

<i>but we do know
he changed our lives.</i>

Come on. What?
Are you chicken, man?

Come on. What?
Are you chicken, man?

Hello.

<i>Get out! Get-- get out of here.
Ohh.</i>

What-- what's wrong with you?

I don't...
Want no... trouble, Mr.--

Joshua.
Nice to meet you... Joshua.

Joshua.
Nice to meet you... Joshua.

Big-big storm. Real...
big storm last year.

Must've been.

<i>I was... baptized here...
As a child.</i>

You were? Huh.

Ramona, how are you today? Haven't
seen you for a while. <i>Fine.</i>

<i>I don't care what you call it! You ain't
gonna play that kind of music in my house!</i>

<i>Music? What do you know about it? I
mean, you don't even listen to it.</i>

<i>Music? What do you know about it? I
mean, you don't even listen to it.</i>

<i>- You don't even listen to me!
I know the whole town thinks you're a slacker!</i>

You just don't understand, do you?
<i>Get back here, Kevin!</i>

Look, it's my music, all right?
Just stay out of-- ho.

I don't need this, dad! You hear me?
I don't need this!

Good morning.

<i>It's perfect. It is?</i>

Yep. I can work
and sleep in the same place.

<i>My husband used to use this as his
workplace, but I never thought...</i>

<i>We'd rent it out
to anyone to live.</i>

It's fantastic. I'll take it. You
haven't rented it, have you?

You got here
just in time, sweetie.

You got here
just in time, sweetie.

What is it you said
you did again?

I'm a wood carver, but I do all sorts
of things-- odd jobs, handiwork.

I like gettin' my hands dirty.

We've got plenty of things to do
around here, keep you real busy.

Here. I made something for you.

You made this? <i>For you.</i>

It's so beautiful.

<i>It's a pretty view, isn't it?</i>

<i>It's perfect.</i>

<i>We all knew he was... different,</i>

<i>and we knew
he was somehow... special,</i>

<i>but none of us knew the trouble we were in and
just how much we would end up needing him.</i>

<i>But none of us knew the trouble we were in and
just how much we would end up needing him.</i>

He's tearin' down the church!
He's tearin' it down!

What? Michael Reed, what are you talking
about? He's tearin' down the church!

Can I help you?
Actually, yeah.

Can I help you?
Actually, yeah.

You didn't really mean, "can I help
you?" Did you? <i>- Got that right.</i>

You meant, what the heck am I doing here?
You're right.

What are you doing
tearing down our church?

Well, sometimes we just gotta tear
something down to build it back up again.

I can... see that.
Theo, get back over here.

No. <i>No?</i>

He's right. Sometimes
you must tear it down...

To... build it back up.

To... build it back up.

Well, all right, then.

How could I be late again?

Good morning. Today,
our new testament reading...

<i>Is from the book of acts,
chapter ten.</i>

And in this passage,

and in this passage,

Peter is up on a roof
in joppa, and--

Well, Peter was a fisherman.

Nice to see you.
Thank you.

Nice to see you.
Thank you.

Thank you, father. Thank
you and god bless you.

I don't remember fishing boots as
proper attire for a sermon, father pat.

Thank you. Thank you.

Maggie!

Hey, pat.

I haven't seen you in church in ages, and now
you're gonna sneak off without saying hi?

Actually, it's good-bye.
You got the job.

Mm-hmm. Now, when do
you actually leave?

Mm-hmm. Now, when do
you actually leave?

In about a week or so. I still have so
much I have to go through at the house.

A few memories, huh?

Excuse me.

Hello? Deb. Listen, could you
hold on just for a second?

Okay. I'm sorry.

Um, thank you, father pat.
It was great seeing you.

You too, Maggie. Hey, if you're in town
next week, come by the pancake breakfast.

Oh, no, Maggie. I'm
not cooking this year.

Oh, no, Maggie. I'm
not cooking this year.

I'll try.

Okay. Good-bye. Good-bye.

â™ª No, he's nice. It's just--
I'm not ready, you know?

No, I'm not.
I need to get out of here.

<i>However, you never know...</i>

What might make me wanna
stick around.

Look, Joan, don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

<i>I could find out everything that
can be found out about him.</i>

<i>I could find out everything that
can be found out about him.</i>

The U.S. post office doesn't miss a thing.
Except deliveries.

Who are you guys talking about?
Joshua, the guy renting our barn.

He gave me this pretty heart.
Ohh.

Thanks. Oh, there-- there's
the guy I was talking about.

Hey, look at that. Hey,
Leo, what is that?

That must weigh a ton.
<i>What the hell?</i>

<i>Look at that!</i>

<i>How much does that thing weigh?</i> I don't
know. About, what, 500 pounds maybe?

<i>How much does that thing weigh?</i> I don't
know. About, what, 500 pounds maybe?

Five'll get you ten, he don't get to
the end of main street. You're on.

Leo, this is gonna be the easiest
money I ever made. I don't think so.

Hey, buck, what's goin' on? You're gonna
break your back. Why don't you use a truck?

I don't drive. Want some water?

No, thanks. I'm fine. If you want
some, ray, you go right ahead.

How does he know your name?
Probably heard you yappin'.

Wow, look at him go.

Wow, look at him go.

Hey, maybe you should put that down.
The footing's not too good around here.

I'll be all right.

<i>Come on, stranger.</i>

Thanks for walking me home, everybody.
Nice of ya.

What? Now we gotta walk all the way back?
Like I told ya, I don't drive.

Thanks. See ya later.

I told ya he was gonna make it.
Shut up.

You shut up. I'll make
you carry me back.

You shut up. I'll make
you carry me back.

<i>â™ª</i>

Hello, Joan. Did it come in?

I kept it right back here for you, father pat.
Hey.

Leo, ray. <i>Hey, father pat.</i>

<i>Ahh. Sonar fisherman. Thanks.
</i> Lookin' good.

Where'd you get that?

You know that fellow that was
carrying the log? He made this?

You know that fellow that was
carrying the log? He made this?

He does all sorts of things.
Really? There's an artist living in auburn? Wow.

Hey, Charlie, you ever find
anything out about his mail?

That's just it.
He doesn't get any mail.

It's not natural to not get any mail.
No junk mail?

<i>Nothing at all?</i> He did get one thing.
Columbia house music offer.

Aw, man! Did he take it?

Thank you.

Thank you.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>Sorry. Emergency. Thanks a lot.
Certainly.</i>

In the name of the father, the
son and the holy spirit, amen.

In the name of the father, the
son and the holy spirit, amen.

Bless me father, for I have sinned. It has
been two hours since my last confession.

And what sin could you possibly have
committed in the last two hours?

I guess my sin is I don't have a sin. I
just need to talk to you right away.

You cannot interrupt members of the
congregation with your own personal needs.

Now, what is so important that you're
using the confessional in this manner?

I found him, sir. Found who?

I found him, sir. Found who?

An artist has moved into town.

Joan Casey has all his stuff at her store.
It's all good. Is it all by hand?

Yeah. This is the lord's work.
An artist living in town.

Maybe he can have it
done by Christmas. Ah.

<i>Hello?</i> Oh, are you the artist?

I'm Joshua. I'm father tardone.
This is father pat.

Hello, father pat. Hi, Joshua.
Nice to meet you.

I have a commission for you.
Hmm. Come on in.

I have a commission for you.
Hmm. Come on in.

You live here? I do.

What do you do when it rains?
Well, it hasn't rained.

I would like you to make a
figure of the apostle Peter.

Now, Peter was not only the
chosen leader of the apostles,

he was established by Jesus as
the foundation of the church.

I know Peter.
Good.

I know Peter.
Good.

Now-- now, I'm looking for
something-- oh, how shall I say--

Expressive of you.

Expressive of my faith.
<i>- Uh, excuse me, Joshua,</i>

there's a hole over your bed.

Father pat.
Oh, sorry.

Now, for material,

I was thinking that
we might use--

Ash.
Ash. Yes. Ash.

Ash.
Ash. Yes. Ash.

That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.

All right. Thanks, Joshua. I'm sure it's
gonna be great. <i>You guys take care.</i>

He seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, maybe.

He's an artist. They can
be temperamental. Yeah.

When I--
When I was in Rome last summer,

I had an audience
with cardinal riccardo.

Uh-oh. He told this interesting
story about Michelangelo.

It seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

it seems that when he was given
his commission, he hit the stone,

and sure enough, the wrong statue
came out of the stone. My goodness.

<i>He began with the simple act of working
on something that needed doing.</i>

<i>It looked like something we all needed,
but, boy, did it cause a lot of trouble.</i>

I saw Joshua rebuilding the
baptist church this morning.

Rebuilding the baptist church?
I thought he was an artist.

Looked more
like a lumberjack today.

Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

Well, I hope he allows time
to finish our statue.

Theo was out there with him.

Theo? How many others
were there?

It was just Theo. Hmm.

Interesting man, this Joshua. He can't
expect to do all that work by himself.

He'll need other people
to help him.

Oh, I think he'll find them.
People really seem to like him.

Really? Is there anything about
this Joshua that strikes you...

As peculiar?

As peculiar?

I have a brother who's peculiar.
Joshua isn't anything like him.

Still, he's different.
He's very different.

You stuck? No, it's just a fuse thing.
It happens all the time.

I think I got it. Uh-huh.

Well, it's the stranger.
The stranger?

Anyone who's lived here less
than 15 years is a stranger.

Anyone who's lived here less
than 15 years is a stranger.

Ah. So that makes you--

An expatriate. I'm moving.

Oh. Said the stranger
I'm Joshua.

Maggie. How you doing?

You just passing through, Joshua?
Yeah, eventually.

Yeah, it's a little slow here.
I don't know.

You never know what might
make you wanna stick around.

You never know what might
make you wanna stick around.

It was good to meet you.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm not gonna cry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and I'm not gonna
lose any sleep â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª tonight â™ª</i> hey.

<i>â™ª 'Cause tomorrow's another
day â™ª</i> you made good time.

I got a ticket for speeding again.
<i>â™ª And I am not afraid â™ª</i>

I got a ticket for speeding again.
<i>â™ª And I am not afraid â™ª</i>

â™ª

Hello, father pat.

Hi, Joshua. How are ya?

Good, thanks. Good to see ya.

Can I offer you something to drink?
No, thanks.

What can I do for ya?
So this is gonna be it?

Yep. Peter's in there somewhere. I just
gotta figure out where he's hiding.

Yep. Peter's in there somewhere. I just
gotta figure out where he's hiding.

Actually, that's why I'm here. I thought--
I thought you might like this book.

Thank you, pat. That's
really nice of you.

Well, this statue...

Is very important
to father tardone.

Yeah, I kind of
got that impression.

<i>He's an interesting man, isn't he?
</i> Hmm.

I'm not sure how happy
father tardone is...

I'm not sure how happy
father tardone is...

Here in auburn.

He was going to go to Rome, work at the
Vatican with his friend cardinal riccardo.

Things didn't work out.
Sometimes it's who you know, you know?

Yeah, I was gonna replace him here.
<i>You will.</i>

Well, if I do, I'll be getting
to the pulpit with a Walker.

Boy, look at that rain
come down.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

It's not raining in here.
Yeah, I know. Amazing, huh?

Yeah.

Well, break's over.

You really gonna
rebuild the baptist church?

We're gonna do our best.

Well, uh,
good luck with everything.

You know, you can stay
if you want, pat.

Well, I'll watch for a little while.
Sure.

You know, you're gonna scare away
all the fish with that racket.

You know, you're gonna scare away
all the fish with that racket.

Hi, Joshua.

What is that thing?
<i>- Oh, the sonar fisherman.</i>

<i>Very special.
Not sold in stores.</i>

There's usually a reason for that.
No, no.

No. Money-back guarantee. It has a special
sonar sound that naturally attracts fish.

We'll see about that.
What are you doing?

We'll see about that.
What are you doing?

<i>No, don't. No, no, no, no! All right.
You owe me 39.95, buddy.</i>

So what am I supposed to do now?
Just fish?

Oh, ye of little fish.

That sounded pretty good.

Something I can do for you, man?

You got a gig coming up
or something?

Something like that.
Can I try?

Something like that.
Can I try?

You play? Not really.

â™ª

â™ª I thought you said
you didn't play?

It's the guitar, man, not me. I'm
just trying to stay out of the way.

It's... going to be...
Beautiful, isn't it?

You can see that already?
I can.

You know... I wanted
to be a... preacher too.

You're gonna be a great preacher, Theo.
No.

Can you imagine... How long...
my sermons would be?

Let me ask you a question. You know
what it is you want to say, don't you?

I d-do.

Well, you just start sayin' it;
I guarantee people will listen.

Hmm.

<i>Joan?</i> In here!

<i>Can I come in?</i> Come on in.

I got your rent. <i>Oh.</i>

Here. I'll put it over here.
Thank you.

What are you cooking?
Uh, well, at one point, it resembled a fish.

What are you cooking?
Uh, well, at one point, it resembled a fish.

This snapper or my marriage.

Well, I know
what the fish would say.

What are these?
Corn fritters.

Joan, this is the worst
corn fritter I've ever tasted.

<i>Joshua had a way of helping
by just-- just being there.</i>

<i>Joshua had a way of helping
by just-- just being there.</i>

Come on. What do you
got in the fridge?

Hello, beautiful.

<i>And bam!</i>

I never thought I'd say this.
I caught a fish this big.

Father pat, as one religious man to another, I
don't think you should be tellin' fish stories.

It was this big.
No. Uh, Joshua... Was with us.

No, he was fishing with me.
He couldn't have been doing either.

He was helping me with guitar.
He was over at my place. He taught me to cook.

I think it was a miracle. Someone
taught Joan how to cook!

I think it was a miracle. Someone
taught Joan how to cook!

Praise the lord!
That's the last wall.

Let's pack it up now and do the rest
tomorrow. Let's get this one up tonight.

Yeah. Let's do this; Then we'll call
it a day. We can... get this done.

Got that right. Hey, tough
guys, grab the braces, okay?

Yeah. All right, everybody.
On three--

One, two, three!

One, two, three!

Push.

All right.

<i>â™ª There's a dream â™ª</i> ooh.

<i>â™ª That I can dream â™ª</i>
Pretty good day's work, guys.

Let's get all these tools put away.
<i>â™ª Of my heavenly â™ª</i>

Hey, reverend, help me with this.
That was great, ray.

There we go. Oh, boy.
We come back tomorrow.

<i>â™ª - I know â™ª</i> You got a broom in your hand.
Why don't you use it?

<i>â™ª That I'm going â™ª</i>
look at this fool.

<i>â™ª That I'm going â™ª</i>
look at this fool.

<i>â™ª There one day, ohh â™ª</i>

<i>We all know the definition
of the word community,</i>

<i>but until Joshua came along, we
didn't really live in one, did we?</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

Okay. I'm ready.

How's this? Is this good?
<i>- Yeah, looks great. Looks great.</i>

<i>All right. All right. We're rolling.
Anytime you're ready.</i>

<i>All right. All right. We're rolling.
Anytime you're ready.</i>

For nearly a year, the auburn
baptist church has stood in ruin,

decaying before the town's eyes.

That was until a few weeks ago, when the
community came together to rebuild it.

Where we stackin' 'em, Dave?
Cut. How was that?

<i>Just great. Great.</i>
Let's grab a few interviews.

This Joshua's an amazing guy. I mean, he
brought the whole community together.

I mean, this place was a wreck two
weeks ago, and look at it now.

He was like a superhero. Yeah, he carried
the log around like it was a swizzle stick.

He was like a superhero. Yeah, he carried
the log around like it was a swizzle stick.

Can I say "swizzle stick"
on television?

He... k-kind of...
Showed me the... way.

I could tell you one thing He's a member
of the Columbia house music club.

That one goes over in the corner, reverend.
<i>Oh, okay, Josh.</i>

Did you get your story?
Well, I don't know.

All they really wanna
talk about is you.

Not much of a story there.

Not much of a story there.

I don't know about that.

Why are you
doing all this, Joshua?

Come on and help us.
You'll find out why.

Hey, Charlie. I'm just
down here helpin' out.

Hey, Charlie. I'm just
down here helpin' out.

Great. Aaron?

Father. Don't scratch
that car, Aaron.

Don't you worry.

Amazing.

<i>Go ahead.</i> Welcome.

You keep yourself busy.
There's a lot to do.

Hello, pat.
Hi. Hello, Maggie.

All these people... Listening to
you, willing to do whatever you say.

We're all in this together.
Yes, of course, Joshua.

We're all in this together.
Yes, of course, Joshua.

Well, I hope you don't work on Sundays.
I try not to.

Good, because if you did, I
wouldn't have anyone to preach to.

Well, I wouldn't worry about that.
Excellent.

So I can expect to see you, then?
See me--

Sunday morning mass. Will
you be joining us, Joshua?

Well, thank you,
father. I'd love to.

Maggie?
Hmm? I will try.

Father pat.

â™ª <i>And the true miracle...</i>

Will come on judgment day,

but until that day,

God is watching you...
Always.

<i>Never forget that.</i>

Never forget that the sins you hide from
your neighbors, you cannot hide from god.

<i>You either embrace his laws
or you reject them,</i>

<i>you either embrace his laws
or you reject them,</i>

but you can
never escape the fact...

That he knows the truth.

Thank you so much.
We'll see you next Sunday.

Bye-bye.

Thank you, father. Nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.

Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

Come again. Bye.

Father tardone,
I am so sorry. I--

Joshua. Father, thank you
so much for inviting me.

You're welcome. Did you--
Did you enjoy the sermon?

I did. It was interesting. I've never
looked at god's law that way before.

What way is that?
Well, as something to be afraid of.

You make it sound pretty scary. -For those
who break god's law, it is pretty scary.

You make it sound pretty scary. -For those
who break god's law, it is pretty scary.

The Bible is clear on that.
That we should fear god more than we love him?

Well, really, the Bible can be
interpreted so many different ways.

For example, there's
the old Sunday school joke.

What's that? Well, you know:
"What does the Bible mean?"

"Basic instructions
before leaving earth."

â™ª Give me my sandwich.

Hey, now, boys, break it up.
You're so mean.

<i>Hey, look at that! Leo!</i>

You as tired as I am?
Ohh, I feel good.

You as tired as I am?
Ohh, I feel good.

Someday you'll be as old as me.
Hopefully as bald.

Look at that.

<i>I don't think I've seen her
laugh like that in a long time.</i>

Why's that?

She's not as happy as she should be.
Who is?

She has more reason than most.

Joe was a great guy, her husband. If any
two people were in love, it was them.

One night a couple years ago,
they were driving home on 34...

One night a couple years ago,
they were driving home on 34...

Near
the "welcome to auburn" sign.

Truck driver fell asleep. Maggie
was behind the wheel of their car.

She walked away, and Joe didn't.

Whatever faith she had,
she lost that night.

No, wait.
Let me help you there. Hold on.

<i>â™ª</i>

Mm. Yeah. Hey, Joan.

Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
with this now--

Hey, Mike, why don't you go get started?
I'll catch up with you.

What happened? Steve got angry
with me, and he threw it.

Ohh. Can you fix it, Joshua?

Of course I can.
Don't you worry about it.

Here. It's okay.

Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it.

First of all,
the pancake breakfast went well,

but that's not why-- that's not
why I'm here to talk to you.

But that's not why-- that's not
why I'm here to talk to you.

<i>Hi, pat.</i>

Oh, hi, Joshua. How are you?
Good.

Glad to see ya. You okay?

Oh, yeah. I'm working on my
sermon for Sunday, so I--

I was gonna go shoot some pool. You wanna
come? No. I should work on the sermon.

We'll work on it inside. You
know, I really-- I-I-I--

It'll be good for you.
Well, one game.

<i>â™ª</i>

I'm pretty good.

<i>Aw, too bad, father.</i>
I'll warm up.

How goes your sermon?
<i>Oh, well,</i>

it's about faith and about how--

It doesn't even matter what it's about,
because father tardone is gonna hate it.

And I'm gonna feel him staring at
me, and I'm gonna get nervous.

Where does he stand?
Well, he says that I'm silly and I'm vague and--

No, no, no. Physically, I mean.
Oh, oh, oh. Right behind me.

Why don't you just talk to the
people that are in front of you?

Why don't you just talk to the
people that are in front of you?

<i>There you go. This guy's good.</i>
By the way, when you said...

That we were gonna play pool, where does
the "me" part of "we" come in here?

<i>All right. I don't wanna hear
that you missed that on purpose.</i>

Okay. I didn't
miss that on purpose.

Smart guy.
Yeah, well, watch this.

You know, I'm still
a little tight-- little tight.

<i>But, hey, it's tough.
Describing it...</i>

<i>But, hey, it's tough.
Describing it...</i>

Is like trying to describe
a color or the wind.

It's actually pretty simple, isn't it?
Simple?

If I'd have known it was simple, I
could've skipped eight years of seminary.

No, I'm serious.
It's about knowing, right?

For instance, I know
I'm gonna make this shot.

I know you can't even
reach the cue ball.

I know you can't even
reach the cue ball.

I didn't say I know
how I'm gonna make it,

but I know I'm gonna make it.

I just gotta
look for a little help.

What you gonna do with that?

Whoa! Man!

Faith. Rack 'em up.

Faith. Rack 'em up.

Well, thanks for the advice,
Joshua, but, let's face it,

how are we gonna get a pool
table into the church?

Well, even if you could, you suck at pool.
There's that too.

<i>Can I drop you somewhere?</i> No, no, no.
I'm not done with you yet.

â™ª You can all call me crazy â™ª

â™ª For some of the things
that I might say â™ª

â™ª You can laugh
all you want to, yeah â™ª

<i>â™ª I know there will come a day â™ª

All right. Good evening,
and welcome to lost and found.

This is a church service?

One man's concert's

As some of you
may or may not know,

one of the guitarists in
the band, Kevin zunbar,

is actually the newest member of
the lost and found congregation.

Whoo!

Thank you. I-I--

<i>There was a long time
where I felt a bit... lonely,</i>

I guess, and angry.

And, I mean, it was like I was
missing something in my life,

but I couldn't figure out
what that something was.

<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

<i>And I've realized
that it was god...</i>

Who I was needing...
<i>- Yeah. All right.</i>

And that all I needed to do
was open my heart up...

And ask him
to be a part of my life.

<i>Yeah!</i> And I did. I did.

So the music we play tonight
is for you...

And him.

One, two, three.

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>There's an old story
about three men...</i>

Looking over A priest,

looking over A priest,

<i>an artist and a cowboy.</i>

And the priest says, "what a
beautiful work god has created."

The artist says,
"what magnificent colors."

And the cowboy says, "boy, what
a lousy place to lose a horse."

Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

Well, uh, I think
the point I'm trying to make...

Is that we're all individuals,
and as individuals,

there is more than one way to look
at the same thing, even the church.

Don't ever give a sermon like
that in my church again.

The pulpit is not a place for jokes, nor
is it a place to express individual ideas.

I was trying to show how we're
all connected to each other.

I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

I will not allow you to express alternative
points of view regarding the church.

<i>Is that clear?</i>

Yes, father.

<i>â™ª When they
excavate these ruins â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª thousands of years from now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª will they wonder
what I was doing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª who I was
and what my life was about â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª when my riches lie in ruin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª on the landscape of my past â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª will they uncover
that I was pursuing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª things in life
that really last â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª where â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª your treasure is â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª the things you love
are a part of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The things you love
are a part of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Won't end â™ª</i>

<i>I can feel the spirit of Jesus in the
room tonight. Can you feel it now?</i>

<i>Let me hear ya, amen.
Amen, amen.</i>

Now, brothers and sisters, what you
gonna experience here tonight...

Is the wonderful, glorious healing power
of our savior, lord Jesus Christ.

All right, now.
Who wants to be saved?

Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands.
Who would like to feel the spirit of god...

Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands.
Who would like to feel the spirit of god...

<i>Reach in and touch you here
this evening, glory be?</i>

You, child, and you, brother.
You, my sister.

What is your name, child?
Sally Baker.

Do you believe that god
loves you, Sally? Yes.

And do you believe that through the healing power
of Jesus that you'll be healed here tonight?

Yes, I do.
<i>Oh, then I say...</i>

Let his spirit fill you
and make you whole!

Amen! Yes! Praise god.

Amen! Yes! Praise god.

<i>Praise god. Hallelujah.
Thank you, Jesus!</i>

I can walk. Thank you.

<i>Jesus, thank you. I can walk.</i>

Whoo! Yes, lord! Yes, lord!
Now, now, brothers and sisters,

brothers and sisters, just a
quiet moment, if you will.

Quiet moment. Before
I ask for your help,

I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

I feel we should take a moment
and think about what we've seen.

Reflect on it. Think about it.
Pray about it.

Let god put it on your heart.
<i>- Amen. Amen.</i>

Let us pray.

You don't have to do this.

We're prayin' here, sir.

No, you're not.

This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

This meeting isn't about prayer.
It's not about healing.

You're not seeing what happened
here tonight. <i>Yeah, I saw it.</i>

You and I saw the same thing.

You know, you don't
have to do it this way.

I know you'd like to have the
faith to talk to these people.

But you don't know
what faith is.

She knows. She understands.

I know what's in your heart.

I know.

I can see.

I can see.

<i>You know something is out of whack
when simple acts of kindness...</i>

<i>And inspiration can lead to so
much misunderstanding and turmoil.</i>

It's a miracle.

A miracle! A miracle.

A miracle.

A miracle.

Aaron, you're Jewish.
What are you doing here?

I thought someone
should tell you.

<i>Father tardone. Have
you heard the news?</i>

Father pat, before you start espousing yet
another miracle, I advise you to take a breath.

Look-- take a breath. Choose
your words carefully.

The lord is with us.
Of course he's with us.

Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

Oh, no, no. He is with us here in auburn.
Yes, pat, he's with us here.

And I know where he lives.
Oh, don't say it.

The people from the revival of angels
meeting are all talking about it.

Joshua went to their tent last night and
healed a blind girl with his own hands.

Another miracle. A revival tent?

That's right. A miracle
in a revival tent?

That is right. I warned
you about this Joshua.

Hey, I'm not the only one.
Everyone says it's a miracle.

What kind of priest is he
turning you into, Patrick?

I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

I have kept my eyes open and my
vision clear, like you advised me to,

and I have been seeing things.

Yes, but you're not
seeing the truth.

Joshua is a fraud, and you're a
fool to be corrupted by him.

Corrupted? No one's been corrupted.
Joshua's the genuine article.

Beware of false prophets.

As soon as this Joshua completes the statue,
I want you to end your association with him.

He's my friend.

He's my friend.

Do you understand me,
father Hayes?

I understand what you're saying.

Good morning. Good morning.

Father tardone.

Good morning, bishop.
Thank you for seeing me.

I'll get right to the point.

A young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

a young man recently moved into our area.
He seemed simple enough,

but he's shown a powerful influence
over a great many people.

They think he's capable
of performing miracles.

The protestant clergy
and I would like...

To call a meeting
of all the clergy in auburn.

And the purpose of this meeting would
be to investigate these miracles?

Oh, no, no. We all have better
things to do with our time.

That I'm glad to hear.

That I'm glad to hear.

However, bishop,

when a man uses such talk of miracles
for his own gain-- for his own cult--

This Joshua has done this?
He lets others do it for him.

Still, it's not as if this man
were a priest saying these things.

He's just a man, and he's free
to do and say as he wishes.

But, bishop, what he says
and does is disruptive.

My own father Hayes follows
him around like a lost puppy.

This is a small fire,
father tardone.

This is a small fire,
father tardone.

You don't need a meeting.

You need
to put out your own fires.

<i>Father tardone, hello.</i>

How are you?

I was hoping the statue of Peter was done.
You're in luck.

Father, meet Peter.

I'll send someone by to pick it up.
You're not pleased.

The statue is fine.
It's the artist you have a problem with.

I made a mistake
hiring you, Joshua.

I'm surprised you found time to finish your
work, considering all your other chores.

I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

I suppose I don't think of them as chores.
You know, father,

we could use your help
down at the baptist church.

<i>Why don't you come down
and join us?</i>

Join you?

Join you?

I know exactly what
you're up to, Joshua.

It's the others
whose eyes are not open.

Father, their eyes are wide open.
To what?

A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

A miracle worker? I have
never made that claim.

No, you would never say that,
because we both know it's not true.

And I think it's time for
everyone else to find out.

Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

Well, look what they've done.
It looks very nice.

Yes, they've definitely made progress.
We'll see the truth.

Yes, yes.

<i>Father pat.</i>

Well, Joshua, I see you've
gathered your followers.

I know most of you. Some of you
are even part of my parish,

<i>and I'm glad to see you here,
because I think...</i>

What Joshua has persuaded you to
do with this church is wonderful.

<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

<i>But I want you all to look...</i>

At this wonderful man
and ask yourselves,

"does anyone do something
for nothing?"

Does a complete stranger offer to help
without wanting something in return?

Father tardone-- shall I tell them
what you're really preaching, Joshua?

Preaching?
You all know this book.

It is the word of god.

It is the word of god.

Joshua, you once told me you don't fear
god. I don't think you know what this is.

It's a love letter.

A love letter?
Yeah.

Isn't that the Bible's main
message, that god loves you?

What about sin and god's law?

<i>You're not an ordained minister. How
dare you assume the role of the clergy?</i>

Wait a minute. That-that-that's
not what's happening here.

What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

What Joshua has done
is a miracle.

<i>Living next to each other didn't make
us neighbors. It certainly didn't...</i>

Make us care about
one another, did it?

<i>But by working together
here with Joshua--</i>

Look around you. We have become
a community. <i>His community.</i>

Led by him. This is how it starts.
I have seen it before.

<i>Come on. You don't really believe
he's gonna start some kind of cult?</i>

I do. He's a terrible threat.

If you are still so blinded by
your fear that you can't...

See the good in this man--

See the good in this man--

If you can look at this church and how
everybody here has changed for the better...

And say, "this must be stopped"?

<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Whatever it is you stand for,</i>

father tardone, I don't want
to be a part of.

I can't.

I won't wear this anymore.

I won't take it.

You see? You see
what he has done?

May god have mercy on you.

You don't have to do it, pat.

He's just afraid. No.

No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

No, it's not about father
tardone, not even about you.

About this. It's me.
I'm the guy.

I am part of the clergy
in this town, and, uh,

I believe in those people and
wanna be there for them,

but I quit
because I'm too afraid.

I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

I'm too-- I can't take
what's in here...

And live by it and teach it.

So I might as well...

Just accept that I suck
at being a priest.

It's not true, pat.

What do you know about
being a priest, Joshua?

What do you know about the
responsibility I feel?

You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

You're just a guy. You're just a
guy who's trying to help out.

Same as you.

No, it's not that simple, because
I have to be more than that.

There is so much
in here that I--

It just needs
to be understood, and--

I can't.

I can't be the one
to show them the way,

'cause I'm the one
that's the failure.

You're wrong, pat.

It is that simple.

Hi, Maggie.
Hey, Joshua.

<i>Made it just in time.</i>

<i>Made it just in time.</i>

Now, Theo,

since you're the first one
who came to help,

you should be the one
to put the bell on the steeple.

Aw, thank you, j-Joshua.

Hand it over, guys. I-I got it.

Take it easy, now.
That thing is big.

It's a long way up there.

Praise our lord.

Praise his... h-holy name.

Praise his... h-holy name.

No! No!

No! No!

No!

Theo, can you hear me?

I know you can hear me.

I want you to listen.

You're gonna wake up.

Your work's not done. You've got
a whole lot more left to do.

Okay, now, come on.

Let's just wake up.

Come on, now.

Come on, now.

Wake up.

That's it.

That's it.

That's it.

What happened?

You fell off the roof.

Hey, pat,
you wanna give us a hand?

Sit up. You'll be all right.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

You all right?

I'm okay.

Thank you.

What just happened here?

What just happened here?

I mean, it's-it's possible he
survived the 40-foot fall...

And-and heart stop.

And they start again. I know that.
That happens. But you--

You talked to,
and-and put your hands on...

A certifiably dead person and
you brought him back to life.

<i>Joshua had a way of making a person
see what was inside of them,</i>

<i>and that even applied to me.</i>

Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has
been one week since my last confession.

What was your sin, my son?

I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

I let my anger get in the way of my
calling. I turned my back on my vocation.

But I have overcome
my crisis of faith.

And what has caused
this reversal?

You know what it is.
I am not resigning.

I know what I have seen,
and I know what I have to do.

So now this Joshua
has stolen my congregation?

You leave me no choice but to
involve Rome, pat. It's father pat!

I promise you, father pat, the
Vatican shall know of this,

and when they do, this
miracle worker will vanish.

He will simply run away.

He will simply run away.

You're wrong about him,
father tardone.

Joshua?
<i>- Hey, Charlie.</i>

In all my years
as a postal employee,

I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

<i>What?</i> This isn't a letter.

It's a present. From who?

It's from the Vatican.

Special Vatican stamp
is right there.

Huh? You know, when
you visit the pope,

you're supposed to bring a gift.

I don't know if I'll be visiting the
pope, but thanks for the etiquette tip.

Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

Do you think I could
get a picture with it?

Well, sure,
if you've got a camera.

I've got--
I've got one here.

You will be giving the sermon this
Sunday, and I shall be back in, uh,

in less than a week.

Hmm. Why are you going to Rome?

If you must know, I've decided
to take my study now.

I have you and your pancakes
to thank.

You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

You know, Joshua
was invited to the Vatican.

Really? I think I heard
some mention of that.

<i>They won't let you in.</i>

I advise you to make the most
of your sermon, father pat.

It'll be a long time before
you're given your own parish.

Come on in.

Hi.

Maggie, hi.

Um, I just wanted to make sure
I said good-bye.

Oh, yeah, your new job.
Good luck with that.

No, act-- actually, I meant you...
In Rome.

I just assumed you
wouldn't be coming back.

Yeah, I don't know.

Yeah, I don't know.

Actually, I'm being
a little nosey.

Um, I kind of wanted
to see where you lived.

Yeah? Well, here it is.

I sleep up there,
and I work over here.

It suits you somehow.

Oh, wow.

Wow, Joshua. This is lovely.
<i>Thanks.</i>

It's yours.

And you know what's
the best part?

Come here. Look at that.

<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

Isn't that something
in the moonlight?

Then why are you leaving?

Why are you?

I'm not the one.

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

No, Maggie--
No, I'm sorry. I'm--

Wow. I'm, uh--
I misread. I--

I-I apologize. I really--

No. <i>I feel like an idiot.</i>

I just...

Miss my husband, and, um--

This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

This is so confusing. I--
My life is a mess.

Your life's not a mess, Maggie.

Your life is beautiful.

My life <i>was</i> beautiful.

It was great. It was whole.

Now it's--

That is my life,
and it can't be fixed.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Thank you, everyone.

That is a classic rendition
of that song.

And, um, I just can't
thank you all enough,

and I really appreciate it.

But, uh, I have to get up really early to catch
a plane tomorrow, so I'm gonna say good night.

But, uh, I have to get up really early to catch

Theo. I'll miss you too.
I'll miss you.

Take care of yourself, will you?
Same. I will. Godspeed.

Remember to lay off the pasta, Joshua.
Oh, yeah.

Those carbs will kill you.
I can see that, buddy.

Take care. Yep. You too.

<i>Joshua.</i> Joan,

it was delicious!

I had a good teacher.

Will we see you again?
You never know.

There's always a place for you.
I know that.

Charlie. Take care.
Thanks for everything.

Hey, you too.
Send us a postcard.

I will. You got it. Joshua.

Don't forget to send us
back some pictures.

Oh, great. I won't.
It's a promise. Okay.

Kevin. I never got another
chance to play with you.

Yeah. We will, okay?
Soon enough.

All right. Take care.
All right. You too.

Reverend. Joshua, the church
will be praying for you.

And I for you. Thank you.

You know that.

Mrs. munroe.
Take care, all right?

<i>I will.</i>

Okay.

Pat.

I was gonna stay here
and clean up.

You'll be doing
a lot more than that.

I'll be seeing you.

I'll be seeing you.

There were 12 of us.

Well, I just-- I wanted to say
good-bye for real this time.

I'm finally leaving.

I'm finally leaving.

Well, I believe you.

In fact, I'm glad you're here, 'cause when
Joshua left, he gave me something for you.

He said he made it.

Not bad, huh?

didn't have to.</i>

<i>But I now know that from the
moment Joshua set foot in auburn,</i>

<i>but I now know that from the
moment Joshua set foot in auburn,</i>

<i>Rome was his destiny.</i>

Ah, you must be Joshua.

Ah, you must be Joshua.

Welcome to the Vatican.

I'm glad to be here.

An old friend, father tardone,

<i>has told me what has been
happening in, uh,</i>

auburn, I guess it is.

From what I hear, you've been doing
some extraordinary things in auburn.

No, cardinal, I've done
nothing extraordinary.

I came to auburn and saw
there was work to be done.

God's work?
<i>You could say that.</i>

God's work?
<i>You could say that.</i>

I started to build
and people came to join me.

You built a church,
as I understand it.

For what reason?
I never thought I needed a reason.

So you don't
consider yourself a--

A spiritual leader?

I am what I am.

You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

You don't seem dangerous
or evil.

<i>Don't let him fool you,
cardinal.</i>

He is not what he seems.
I know who you are.

On our friendship,

this man is a danger.

I beg a formal condemnation
of him by the Vatican.

<i>I believe he is leading
our people away from god.</i>

<i>Father tardone, if you honestly believe
that I'm some sort of false prophet...</i>

Who's come to auburn
to mislead people,

<i>then I accept your condemnation.</i>

<i>Then I accept your condemnation.</i>

But is that truly
what you see in me?

It is.

I fear you are out
to hurt my people.

That's not what
you're afraid of, is it?

You don't fear me?

You fear what's inside of you.

How do you know
what's inside of me?

You're afraid to love.

No, that's not true.

Don't be afraid.

What are you doing?

Oh, my lord.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Please forgive me.

Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

Cardinal riccardo
saw what I saw.

And now... You'll have an
audience with the pope.

I look forward to it.

You'll be meeting with him too.
Hmm.

Soon.

The cardinal saw
the change in you.

He knows the good work
you've been doing...

Here.

Is that so?

Is that so?

Father pat gets his parish...

And I get my dream?

So it would seem.

I think--

I think I'm happier
for father pat.

Joshua, if I may,

Joshua, if I may,

what will you tell the pope?

I'll say the same thing
I've been saying.

Joshua.

It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

I've heard many things
about you.

Cardinal riccardo
was very impressed by you.

I brought you a gift.

I brought you a gift.

These are some tools
that I work with.

Ah, yes. We have
much work to be done.

Sit down.

I wanted to thank you for the
pledge you made as a child.

My pledge?

When your sister was ill.

When she was near death...

And you spent the entire night in the
loft of your father's barn praying.

Then the next morning
she was well.

You went to the top of a hill and
you pledged your life to god.

Who are you?

Peter, don't you know me?

Peter, don't you know me?

The world has become
such a frightening place.

There's so much anger
and not enough love.

Deep in the hearts of so many
people is an emptiness...

That nothing of this world
can fill.

And that emptiness makes it
impossible for them to love.

It's so overwhelming.

What should I do?

What should I do?

Remind them that I love them--

That I died for them.

Tell them that my love
is real...

And that if they open their hearts
to it, I will fill that emptiness,

and they will be able
to love one another.

That's the message.

It hasn't changed.

Tell them, Peter.

Tell them.

<i>Life teaches us many lessons,</i>

<i>and Joshua certainly taught us some wonderful
ones about love and understanding.</i>

<i>But now I'd like to examine one
of the lessons from the Bible.</i>

Today I want to talk about Peter,
the fisherman, a man I relate to,

because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

Because it seems like every time he opened
his mouth, he stuck his foot into it.

So let's say "amen" for Theo.

Amen.

Thank you, reverend.

Giving honor and praise to god,

for without his love and mercy,
