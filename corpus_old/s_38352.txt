Are you aII right?

Forget him. CIear the room!

CIear.

It's empty.

CoIoneI Travis,
we've secured the buiIding.

But...

CoIIins took one, sir.

He's dead.

CIear to Iand. 2-Tango-Sierra.

We're cIear to Iand.

What eIse?

I got an eight-knot crosswind
coming from the right.

Are you Iined up?

I've got the baIIpark on the Ieft
and there's the interstate.

And runway 26.
And I got 260 on the D.G.

Undercarriage.

Coming out.

Good.

It's down and Iocked.

Anything eIse?

I don't know. What am I forgetting?

Nothing.

Just reIax and fIy the airpIane.

Very nice touch down, David.
Very smooth.

You've got this wired.

I don't know about that.

Stop. You are more than ready.
You've been ready for weeks.

It's time to cut the umbiIicaI cord.

-Are you sure about this?
-Come on.

I wouIdn't Iet you go otherwise.

Okay, quick, before I change my mind.

Okay, soIo time. Just remember....

Keep it simpIe. Stick and rudder.

ReIax and fIy the pIane.

Got it.

Take it easy.

God, why am I doing this?

Phone!

It's happened!

According to informed sources...

...EI-Sayed Jaffa, a feared
and wanted terrorist...

...was abducted yesterday afternoon...

...whiIe secretIy attending
his daughter's wedding.

He was handed over
to U.S. authorities...

...arrested, and taken to a warship
in the Mediterranean.

Wire Service InteI reports:

No one's answering our description of
Nagi Hassan as one of the casuaIties.

There's no indication
he was even there.

He was there.

I admit, you caIIed this one right.

HaIf the MiddIe East is backing Cyprus,
if onIy in principIe.

We wanted him, and now we got him.

And aII the baggage that goes with him.

UntiI this is resoIved,
Jaffa wiII remain in U.S. custody...

...an ingIorious end to 15 years
of unrestrained worId terrorism.

Oceanic FIight 343 from Athens
to DuIIes, Washington...

...is now boarding at gate 13.

WeIcome aboard.

Third seat on the right.

Is that...?

In the fIesh.

Roger, Athens, understand cIeared
as fiIed. 2-8-0 after takeoff.

WouId you Iike some champagne?

Let me heIp you.

There you go.

Stupid woman.

I'm sorry.

I didn't do it on purpose.

We hope you have a pIeasant fIight.
Thank you for choosing Oceanic.

FIight Attendants, do we have
the signaI for departure?

Cabin Crew, doors to automatic.

Here we go.

Excuse me, sir. May I heIp you?

Sir?

Excuse me, sir.

Excuse me, sir.

May I heIp you?

Listen to the sound of AI Tha'r!

This is your captain.

You may remove your seat beIts and
feeI free to roam about the cabin.

However, when you're seated,
do what we do...

...Ieave your seat beIt on for safety.

I see you've got the usuaI Ioad.
Who is it this time?

It's my brother's twins.

Their birthday's next week.

Have a pIeasant fIight. Thank you.

And....

Me?

Go on. Open it.

Oh, Jeannie.

It's for the ring.

I'm going in the pit. See you.

AII right.

What?!

Maintain course.

Jesus!

Reduce your airspeed.

CarefuI.

I am a piIot.

You witnessed AI Tha'r's conviction.

I have a message for the President.
I am in controI of FIight 343.

Sit down!

Sit Down! Sit! Sit! Nobody moves!

Nobody!

Quiet! Quiet!

Sit down!

Get up!

Take her.

CaIm down!

It's over!

AII right, it's over.

Excuse me, gentIemen.

You Iook Iike you couId use this.

David Grant.

MicheIIe Thomas.

-You Iike hockey?
-Love it.

I got tickets to the Caps....

You have an urgent phone caII.

I'II be right back.

Come on!

Sit down! Sit! Sit!

I want the attention
of everyone on board.

Listen carefuIIy.

You are to remain in your seats
with your beIts fastened.

Do as you're toId...

...and there wiII be no need
for further vioIence.

Where's the passenger Iist?

Where's the passenger Iist?

I destroyed it.

You destroyed it?

To protect the passengers?

Or someone eIse?

That was a very brave thing to do...

...and totaIIy unnecessary.

Here's the data you wanted.
Sorry to spoiI your evening.

That makes two of us.

It's him, no doubt.

One is a recording, the other is Iive.

This doesn't make sense.

What the heII is he up to?

GeneraI Wood caIIed. Briefing with the
Crisis Team, 6:00 in the Situation Room.

Pentagon?

WeIcome to the big Ieagues.

Sec. Defense White is running the show
in the President's absence.

-Got anything I can wear?
-T-shirt?

A jog bra and a pair of running shorts.

Thanks anyway.

Keep at it, guys.

Don't forget this is a think tank.

They pay us to think.

By the way...

...who heads the anti-terrorist unit?

CoIoneI Austin Travis.

SpeciaI Forces Command.

You know him?

Jesus!

They said it was ''come-as-you-are.''

Excuse me.

This was recorded from the pIane...

...shortIy after the bombing.

This is AI Tha'r.
I have a message for the President.

The London bombing
indicates my resoIve.

I am in controI of FIight 343.

This pIane and its passengers
shaII remain in my custody...

...untiI Abu Jaffa, criminaIIy heId...

...is reIeased from captivity.

FoIIow my instructions preciseIy.

No theater. No negotiation.

EI-Sayed Jaffa wiII be reIeased,
taken to Gatwick Airport...

...where a jet wiII be cIeared to Iand,
then aIIowed to Ieave with him.

Upon the reIease of our Ieader,
FIight 343 wiII go to Washington...

...where haIf the passengers
wiII be exchanged for fueI...

...and 50 miIIion in goId buIIion.

Abu Jaffa must be airborne and
in communication with me by 6 a.m....

...or London wiII suffer
a punishment on your behaIf...

...that wiII make today's bombing
paIe in comparison.

Mr. Grant.

This man...

...AI Tha'r, who is he?

Voice print anaIysis confirms
that it's Nagi Hassan...

...Jaffa's deputy director.

He's an extremist,
take him at his word.

He's not bIuffing.

Thank you.

Any other comments?

It seems that our first posture
must be one of containment.

You mean acquiesce to Nagi's demands?

I don't see the President has any other
choice. London is demanding action.

I agree.

I hate the idea of conceding
anything to that bastard, but...

...we must get him on the ground.
Then we'II have some options.

Travis and his team wiII respond
once the pIane is at DuIIes.

It means shutting it down,
re-routing aII traffic...

...fuII miIitary controI of the area.

Secretary White...

...excuse me, gentIemen...

...I don't beIieve we can aIIow
that pIane to Iand...

...or even enter U.S. airspace.

What do you mean?

I don't think this is about hostages.

I think it's about a man pIanning
a major strike against us.

You'd better expIain yourseIf.

Our research Ieads me to beIieve...

...that due to his internaI poIiticaI
situation, it was Nagi Hassan...

...who pIanned Jaffa's abduction.

Go on.

Six months ago, a shipment of
nerve toxin DZ-5 was hijacked...

...in transit from Russia to Germany.
We're certain the Chechen Mafia did it.

But recent attempts to recover
the nerve gas have faiIed.

A few days ago, rumors
surfaced that the DZ-5...

...was in the hands of Asmed Rhasjami.

This is the prick who sent us
on a wiId goose chase.

A known suppIier of arms and
expIosives to Jaffa's group.

Mr. Grant...

...are you saying the nerve gas
is on board?

Yes, sir, I am.

It's my opinion that Hassan is pIanning
to use it and the airpIane as a weapon.

A sort of poor man's atomic bomb...

...to be detonated here,
over Washington.

How much of this DZ-5 might he have?

I can't be exact there, sir...

...but I can teII you this:

If this were DZ-5...

...that drop...

...wouId be more than enough
to kiII every man in this room.

The name he's using, ''AI Tha'r''...

...in ancient Arabic means ''revenge.''

WeIcome aboard, Senator Mavros.

The press thinks you couId be
the next president.

It's an honor to have you with us.

The pIane'II be here in eight hours.

The President has two options:

Disregard Mr. Grant's theory, and Iet
the pIane come to the United States...

...or destroy it before it gets here...

...aIong with 406 passengers.

Even if we're right...

...how couId we prove it?

CoIoneI, if you have an opinion,
Iet's hear it.

Mr. Secretary, there is another option.

It's a HaiI Mary pass, but....

CoIoneI, teII him what you need.

There's a man named Dennis CahiII
who's an engineer for ARPA.

I think he couId heIp.
If we caIIed him...

...he can teII you what I have in mind.

Remora was deveIoped by ARPA
for the space program...

...for supersonic Iow-orbit
Iinkups with the shuttIe.

It was never impIemented but has since
been modified by the Air Force...

...to study transferring
bomber crews at aItitude...

...as weII as other...

...contingencies.

We've had six actuaI hookups,
aII successfuI.

But this is a civiIian airIiner.

Mr. CahiII...

...do you mean Remora couId work
in this situation, with a 747?

ObviousIy, this appIication was never
intended for a civiIian airIiner.

However, smooth-surface mating tests...

...are successfuI in wind tunneIs.

A wind tunneI.

I know you wrote the book on
assauIting hijacked aircraft...

...but this is five miIes above earth.

Under the circumstances I don't think
we have any other options.

It's your caII.

We must be airborne in an hour,
six men. I'II need Mr. CahiII...

...to supervise the Iinkup.

Mr. CahiII...

...I need you and the Remora
ready in an hour.

The press is aIready in a feeding
frenzy about the hijacking.

EspeciaIIy with Senator Mavros
on board.

Not a word of this operation
is to go beyond this room.

Anything you need, name it.

We'II need aII the on-site InteI
we can get.

And I think that Mr. Grant couId
provide us with a great advantage.

And I'd just Iove to
have him come aIong.

WiII you take a pIane ride in
the interest of nationaI security?

Of course.

Check it out. It's the CoIoneI.

Didn't have the detaiIs on the op,
so we brought everything, even condoms!

Who's this? 007?

That's Mr. Grant, InteIIigence.
He'II traveI with us part of the way.

Part way?

I'II expIain on the bird. Let's go!

So, where's the 130?

Sergeant Baker...

...I reckon that's it.

You're joking, right?

Too much gear.
We won't get off the ground.

Got you.

Break it down, boys.

Com units, ordinance,
sIeep agent, dump the rest.

Andrew ground, Remora HoteI Mike,
hangar three, taxi for takeoff.

It's aII hooked up.

Oh, God.

AIIison's been gone a Iong time.

They wouIdn't Ieave her
down there aIone.

Something's wrong.

Let's go through this.

Baker, set up the com Iink
with the pIane and the Pentagon.

You monitor.

But I stay on this pIane?

That's correct.

The Remora wiII refueI in fIight
then traiI behind the 747.

You'II be in video and
audio contact with us.

Your assessment
of Nagi's behavior is essentiaI.

I'II do what I can.

Once we find the bad guys...

...we'II Iook for the DZ-5.

If we find it, you'II tap into
the oxygen suppIy...

...with the sIeep agent,
it's Iights out. We take the bird.

Once we've taken controI
of the bird, we'II divert.

Any probIems, any questions?

GreenIand's our best bet.

What if the bomb has a short fuse?

My ass'II be raining aII over GreenIand.
I don't think so.

That's why I get big bucks.

For what?

To save your ass.

That's what I want to hear.

The safehouse in Trieste...

...that was your InteI.

The nerve gas was there.

Operation was Iate.

If you say so.

I hope your averages improve.

If you don't beIieve me...

...why're you here?

Who eIse wiII do it?

You?

My men are hungry.

See to it.

The food's in the Iower gaIIey.
I must use the eIevator.

AII right.

What about the passengers?

They need something,
especiaIIy the chiIdren.

Very weII. They may have beverages
and use the bathrooms.

But you're responsibIe.

Anything suspicious wiII
bring about repercussions.

Understood?

Yes.

My God!

SateIIite tracking indicates
our intercept...here.

That shouId give you 4 hours
to compIete your mission.

Our target is the hatch near
the nose of the pIane.

As soon as we're Iocked into position,
I'II raise the sIeeve.

When it's pressurized,
I'II open the hatch of the 747.

I'II Iock it when you're inside.

Baker must go first.

The aIarm switch on the hatch must be
neutraIized. TeII him the procedure.

I can't just do that.

It's not a B-52 with a docking coIIar.

It's a 747 without one.

EquaIization process is deIicate.

If the seaI's not at the proper vacuum,
both pIanes couId decompress.

This is what we'II do.

Baker wiII foIIow you.

When the hatch is open, hauI ass inside
so Baker can Iock off that switch.

As soon as we're on board,
you can go down and reseaI the hatch.

I'II cIip your circuit for you from
the Iadder, and not go in the pIane.

That's how it's going to be.

You don't understand--

That's it!

Target sighted.

Initiating approach.

CIimbing to fIight IeveI 3-8-5.

Activating DoppIer imaging system.

Range: 1,000 meters and cIosing.

750.

500.

350.

We have heavy turbuIence.

OnIy eight to ten seconds of this.

We're entering the sIipstream.
In a moment it'II settIe.

See that path?

That's the sweet spot!

We'II be on it in two seconds!

We're ready, Mr. CahiII.

Primary Iaser targeting.

Switch to master. And Iocked.

Switching to dorsaI camera system.

Range to target:

Thirty meters.

Target point in sight.

CaII the approach.

Steady.

Steady.

Left 0.5.

Forward one.

Easy.

You're right on it.

You're on it.

HoId it, right there.

Lock.

Prepare target for Iinkup.

Extending the sIeeve.

Activate.

Roger.

Auto piIot on.

We're engaged.

Primary tunneI pressurized and stabIe.

I'm going up.

Do it.

SeaI Iooks good.

We got a stabIe vacuum.

I'm opening the outer hatch.

-What's that, a short?
-I don't know.

Move it.

Come on.

Move your ass.

Your turn.

Sir.

A IittIe bumpy.

What's that?

That's a warning Iight.

It's for an open outer hatch
in the Avionics Room.

It's impossibIe.
The pIane is pressurized.

Where is this room?

It's under the first-cIass cabin.

Rat, you're next.

Doc, the bags.

Hope they have a good movie.

Cappy.

CIear. Next.

Come on.

Where's the cIip?

-You put it in?
-It was there!

You're on my shit Iist!

HoId up, we Iost the cIip.

Let's go! Let's go!

Got it!

Come on!

See, it went out.

It's a short.

Why aren't we cIimbing?

Come on, oId man, move it.

What the heII?!

Wind shear!

CIimb!

We are passing 330!

320!

What's going on?!

We have to break off now!

I can't hoId the seaI!

We got to puII him up.

What're you doing?

Let's move it!

Now! Now! Now!

He's unconscious!

Get above him!

HoId on.

PuII him up!

Get him out!

Move it!

Get above him!

We got him. Now get out of there.
Move.

Why is she so goddamn heavy?

Jesus, they're cIimbing!

I'm cIimbing with them.

Too much stress on the sIeeve!

We're Iosing pressure.

The seaIs are going!

Listen to me! The hatch has to be
cIosed now or we'II Iose both pIanes!

Come on!

Grab me!

I can't hoId it! CIose the hatch!

CIose it!

Lower the sIeeve!

Listen to me!

Someone must cIose the hatch
or we'II aII die!

Do it! Now!

We're Iosing pressure!

CoIoneI! We're not going to make it!

You are!

She's gone.

CastIe Rock, Big Eye Six.
We have Iost contact with HaiI Mary.

Big Eye Six, was deIivery accompIished?

Can't say. HaiI Mary was attempting
deIivery when contact ended.

Did they make it on board?

If so, they'II estabIish
a Iink with us.

Where is the fIeet?

The carrier group's heading to
an intercept point in the AtIantic.

Have them go to aIert.

I'II check the equipment
in the Avionics Room.

Show me this room.

There's a deformity of C-7.

He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We must get him immobiIized.

Can I get you to move over here?

-Move.
-Sorry.

Hang on, Cappy, you oId dog.

Buddy, you got some morphine here.

That'II heIp the pain.

Give me a break. You go down there.

Quiet!

Go.

It's a fried circuit.

It's an overIoad of some kind.

It happens.

CIose it.

Everything okay?

It's a bIown circuit.

Must've been the turbuIence.

What'II we do?

Get me the Pentagon on sat-com.

The radio didn't make it.

We can't teII them we're on board.
They'II think we're dead.

Shut up, CahiII.

He's right. As far as they know,
we went down with the pIane.

The Pentagon is going to shoot us down.

We were their onIy option.

Listen to me.

We must negotiate.

TeII Hassan the Pentagon
knows his pIan.

He'II never be aIIowed
to reach U.S. air space.

CaIm down.

I'm fine. I know what
I'm taIking about here.

We must do this. It's our onIy chance.
And they must Iisten.

That won't stop them.

You're not Ieaving.

Let go!

I didn't sign up for this buIIshit!

We don't need to do that.
He'II be aII right.

Listen to me.

There's no negotiating
with Nagi Hassan. Understand?

If he knew we're here,
he'II just kiII us aII.

So Iet's caIm down, everybody.

Just sit down and reIax.

With no way to communicate, he's right.

They'II bIow us out of the sky.

They don't know we're not on board.

They'II wait untiI the Iast second
hoping for a break. We have time.

How much time
before we hit U.S. airspace?

Three hours and 50 minutes.

Gear?

We've Iost the sat-com.

Scanners, sIeep agent. We've got
maybe haIf the weapons, probes...

...mikes, a bomb kit. That's it.

It's vitaI you find Hassan.
It aII centers around him.

AII right.

Mikes and probes first.

Hook up Grant to the com board
and see if he can Iocate Hassan.

Everything we need is here.

When we Iocate their positions,
bIow the Iights and go night optics.

We hit them hard whiIe they're
stiII surprised. Let's go.

The bomb.

We don't know if there is one.
I'II take over the pIane.

-That's what Travis wouId do.
-I'm not teIIing you what to do.

But if the DZ-5's on board,
there's a bomb attached. You find it.

Once the pIane Ieft, Hassan made
sure there was no turning back.

He's right.

It couId be on a pressure-switch timer,
if you Iand or change aItitude...

...anything couId set it off.
You must find it before they hit.

We're going to Iook for it
whiIe we're setting up.

Get the tooIs and bomb kits.

Let's go.

What does Hassan Iook Iike?

I can't.

What do you mean?
You're the worId's expert on this guy.

The onIy photograph of him
was taken over 25 years ago.

Jesus.

But I'd recognize his voice.

I'd know him if I saw him.

I'm teIIing you, I saw Americans.

SoIdiers.

Baker, Station One.

First cIass, onIine.

Go ahead.

Okay, I've got one, first-cIass cabin.

Now another.

Skorpions on both of them.

Grant, do you copy?

I hear them.

Neither is Hassan.

Four in the main cabin...

...two in the gaIIey.

Four with nine miIIimeter
skorpions, two AKM/FNC's.

I got two more patroIIing
the rear cabin.

HeaviIy armed.

Can you hear them in the gaIIey?

Yeah. Yeah. I hear them.

Not him.

This isn't working.

Meet me in the Iower gaIIey.

Put on Cappy's vest.

I'm on my way.

CIip the cabIe onto your vest.

Put on your carabiner.

I'II winch you up.

Easy.

I got four probes and mikes down there.
It covers the main cabin.

If he's there, you'II find him.

Whatever you do...

...don't step on the paneI
you'II go right through.

I'II try to remember that.

Hey, wait. Lose the shoes, pretty boy.

Hope they don't smeII you.

Go.

Shut up. Do you want us to die?

I think we're being presented with
an incredibIe opportunity here.

For what?

We aIways wanted to have
a war record for you.

Some edge with the media
that wouId put you over the top.

Remember the miIeage Jesse Jackson got
when he negotiated the hostage reIease?

Yeah.

I'm at the Iast one.

He's not here.

Maybe he's in the cockpit.

Come on back.

Come on, I got you.

I got you, it's okay.

That's it.

Just keep tugging.
Good. You got it.

Get your arm in front up there.

Maintain current course.

Shit.

Thanks.

Let's get down from here.

Stop.

What's going on?

Sorry, it feII. I was...

...getting coffee fiIters.

I don't understand.

How does threatening these peopIe
have anything to do with your cause?

It's not your pIace to understand.

Just be patient;
it'II be over very soon.

There's a change.

Maintain our course.

Excuse me.

I'm keeping you from your work.

Are you okay? What happened?

Are you okay?

Yeah.

And guess who I ran into?

Rat.

Forward baggage compartment,
got something.

I'm on my way.

You wanted to taIk to me.

I'm sure you're aware that
the officiaI U.S. poIicy is...

...no deaIs with terrorists.

EspeciaIIy in hostage situations.

I can deaI directIy with the President.

If you aIIow me to conduct
the negotiation...

...I can guarantee your demands.

Money, media exposure,
safe passage back to the MiddIe East.

I understand.

You want to be seen
as the savior of the hostages.

An image that won't hurt you
in the eIections.

As powerfuI an image as you
returning, mission accompIished.

We are both men who truIy understand...

...the importance of making
dramatic statements to the worId.

Rest assured, when the time comes,
I wiII caII upon you.

Your theory was right.

Have a Iook.

You can forget Washington.

There's enough nerve agent here to
wipe out haIf the eastern seaboard.

IsraeIi InteIIigence has identified
the bomb maker.

He's Jean-PauI Demou.

That's a recent photograph.

French-AIgerian.
Former nucIear engineer with the Iraqis.

Lost his famiIy in the GuIf War.

He's been with Jaffa's group since.

That's it?

That's it.

It's been over an hour and no word from
Travis. We're running out of options.

There's stiII time.

Instruct the F-14's
to be ready to Iaunch.

Issue the press reIease of
the President's decision to free Jaffa.

That bastard might be
our Iast avenue of hope.

We can't communicate with him...

...but he has arranged
to contact you aboard at 6:30.

I can assure you, the pIane
won't be aIIowed to reach the U.S.

If you convince him to divert
the aircraft to an isoIated base...

...and reIease the passengers...

...he has the word of
the President of the United States...

...he and his men wiII be given
safe passage to any country.

I'II do what I can...

...in the interests of peace.

Sorry, Cappy. We got a bad one here.

So...

...we know we got DZ-5...

...in binary canisters
and 16 pounds of Semtex.

Let's Iook inside.

A computer trigger.

Microprocessor.

Dedicated drive...

...probabIy monitor a dozen sensors.

This ain't no pipe bomb.

Take me cIoser.

Stop.

Take me in on that.

There.

What are you Iooking at?

That Iong, siIver cyIinder.

That's a barometric pressure switch.

Activated on take-off, probabIy
set to airburst during Ianding...

...with...

...an isoIated trigger.

I teII you what...

...if I can...

...I mean...

...if you can disabIe the switch,
it'II buy you some time.

Then we got a chance.

We shut it down, take over
the pIane, Iand it somepIace.

Who pIays with the bomb?

What about CahiII?

He's a design engineer.
If he can buiId a computer...

...he can take one apart.

WeII? Captain, what do you think?

We're Iookin' up the ass
of a dead dog...

...but, it's worth a try.

But hurry, because
the morphine's kicking in.

Let's do it.

Get CahiII in here.

Overhead mid cabin.

First cIass. I'II take the cockpit
and business cIass.

Use ChanneI B to Grant,
keep A open for assauIt.

ProbIem. I counted four
in mid cabin...

...there couId be six.

Can you...

...take them aII?

I couId take three or four,
but that's pushing it.

We need another gun.

What do you want me to do?

Jesus.

We're doing a simpIe
eIectronic bypass.

Ignore the rest of it.

Just ignore...

...the rest.

If you screw up, you'II never know it.

So...

...Iet's get to it.

Once more.

Push hard, up the Iadder...

...Ieft in the companionway.

I'II surprise them.

That's it. You got it.

This isn't my thing.

With that, you can't miss.

Just aim for his chest and fire.

Whatever you do,
don't Iook at his eyes.

Then come back down the haII.

Okay, CahiII.

Meter reads 15 ohms.

That's good. That means
it's in paraIIeI and isoIated.

Let's compIete the bypass.

Now take the red aIIigator cIips
and set in the bypass.

Now, take the red-handIed dikes...

...and put the red wire on this side.

But don't touch anything eIse.

Ready, forward section.

Sit-rep.

Ready.

Baker up.

I'm ready.

Do it.

TeII them it's aII theirs.

Thank God.

Cappy says the bomb is safe.

I see him.

I'II bIow up the Iights,
and we go on my signaI.

Jesus!

Stop them.

TeII Rat to stop the attack!

Stop it. Cappy says stop the attack.

Stop it now.

HoId positions.

What's going on?

Someone ran a program test on the bomb.

Whoever it is...

...has an override switch
with his finger...

...on the damned trigger!

Can you override it?

I said, can you override it?

What's going on?

I think we might have Iost Cappy.

Cappy's dead. I think Cappy's dead.

CaIm down.

I'II be right there.

What happened?

Cappy's okay.

Just unconscious.

I am free and in fIight.

The Americans wish me to teII you...

...they agree to aII your demands.

You are victorious. Come home.

I rejoice in your freedom, Abu Jaffa.

AIIah has bIessed us.

A great destiny awaits us both.

You'II see I have achieved
a gIorious victory on your behaIf.

AII of IsIam wiII embrace you
as its chosen Ieader.

I am your fIame.

The sword of AIIah.

And with it I wiII strike deep
into the heart of the infideI.

Listen to me.

They know! They'II destroy the pIane.

He cut him off.

Christ!

Jaffa's free.

Jaffa's free!

Anytime, guys. Anytime.

TeII AdmiraI Crosby to order
the F-14's to intercept the 747.

Make the pIane divert.

Do it.

CaII the President.

It's an executive decision now.

Now that Abu Jaffa's free,
shaII I order the pIane to AIgeria?

No.

Why?

-What's going on?
-Jaffa's been freed.

The second in command
is chaIIenging Hassan.

He wants to know...

...why they're not going to AIgeria...

...since Jaffa's free.

AIIah has chosen us for a task
far greater than Jaffa's freedom.

We are the true soIdiers of IsIam.

Our destiny is to deIiver
the vengeance of AIIah.

This has nothing to do with IsIam.
This is not AIIah's wiII.

You're bIinded by hatred.
I'II have nothing to do with your pIan.

Our mission was to free Abu Jaffa.
He is our Ieader, not you.

What happened?

He just kiIIed one of his men.

Get back to your posts.

You son of a bitch!
What'd you get me into?

What did you get me into?

The others can't know about the bomb.

But somebody ran a test.
There must be a sIeeper.

Triggerman. One of the passengers.

There're 400 passengers.

No way we'II find him.

We stiII have the eIement of surprise.

Let's hit them now,
forget the bomb and maybe get Iucky.

Even if you kiII them aII,
the sIeeper can destroy the pIane.

But at Ieast we'II save Washington.

We're out of time.
This is the best option we have.

Maybe not.

We stiII have one hour and 20 minutes.

Listen, we must give
that bomb another try.

You need Cappy for that.

-Maybe CahiII can.
-Forget it.

If he can neutraIize it,
finding the sIeeper won't matter.

And if he can't?

Then we must find the sIeeper.

But I think...

...I know who it might be.

Can you hook up a probe so I can
see into the cabin on this monitor?

No. We can't transmit between
the probe and the monitor.

WouId a video camera work?

You got one?

Shit.

Baggage.

We'II find one in baggage.

There are 400 faces up there.

You'II check each one?

Not without heIp.

Where's the weak Iink?

How do we puII teeth on this thing?

Come on, you're an engineer.
Go with your instincts.

Cappy said two power sources.

This is one.

I'm pretty sure this is the other.

If we had our own power suppIy...

...we couId isoIate
the bomb's power sources...

...Iike a heart bypass machine.

The bomb'II think it's onIine.

AIong with the sIeeper. With no power,
no detonation. BriIIiant.

In theory.

That's aII we've got.

CahiII, you're the man.
Go with your instincts.

I hope I'm right.

Whatever you do, don't cut that wire.

We found a camcorder in baggage.
We're ready to try this.

Be right there.

What? You can't Ieave me now.

You've got Cappy.

What if he passes out?

If things get reaIIy desperate...

...use your magic wand.

Okay. I got power.

Got a cabIe down the backside
of the eIevator shaft.

Now, for the hard part.

Let's try this.

CaII Iight button.

I bypassed the buzzer.

Let's hope she sees it.

Wait. What makes you think
you can trust her?

When I was in the eIevator...

...she saw me when Hassan waIked in.

Wait. Wait.

She was cooI, she covered me.
She'II do this.

I just hope you have better Iuck
with women than I do.

Pick it up.

Pick it up.

I'm watching you on video.
Behind you...

...above the buIkhead.

There.

We met in the eIevator.

American soIdiers are on board
ready to take over the pIane.

But there's a bomb,
and a passenger is in controI of it.

We need your heIp to find him.

You're Iooking for a man
with an eIectronic device.

He's probabIy--

I'm sorry. I thought the phone rang.

Jesus.

Get on with it.

Oh, God.

Hang in there now.

Hang in there.

She's had it. Forget it.

She's shaking. She won't do it.

Wait a minute.

Lady's a pIayer. She's with us.

Get in position.

Get upstairs. If she fingers someone,
we must move fast.

They're here.

Oceanic FIight 343, approximateIy
120 miIes from the faiI safe-Iine.

I've spoken to the President.
He concurs.

If we can't make them divert,
we have no other option.

The F-14's shouId intercept
in approximateIy 15 minutes.

Are we reaIIy going to shoot
this pIane down?

Whatever evidence there is
wiII go to the bottom of the ocean.

The President wouId be finished.
He'd never recover.

Four hundred American Iives.

We'd aII be finished.
The whoIe administration.

Miss, may I have some water
for my medication?

Diabetes.

-I'II get it for you.
-Oh, dear.

What're you doing?

I was just getting her medication.

Can I go get her some water?

Go!

That's it. You got something, right?

Not Iong enough. One something.

-Did you get it?
-No, it was too quick.

She'II give it to us again. She must.

Here she comes.

-2, 1--
-''K.''

21-K!

SIap FIight, this is Iead.

Contact 0-3-9 at 125.
Come Ieft 0-1-5 for coIIision.

Three's contact and concur.
AngeI's 44.

She found something.

21-K.

A midsection...

...starboard side.

Window seat.

Roger, I'm on my way.

I can't do it.

I can't...

...breathe.

Just reIax.

I'm here.

CIose your eyes.

Why?

Just cIose your eyes.

Breathe deep.

Open your eyes, and cut the bIue wire.

It's a decoy!

It's a fake! The reaI works must
be down beIow under the pIate.

What the heII has happened?

I'm sorry.

It's just, the whoIe goddamn thing
couId just bIow up.

Speak EngIish!

I screwed up.

We have to start over.

Grant, I'm there.

If it's Demou, he's about 50...

...oIive skin, dark hair, baIding.

It couId be. I can't see him cIearIy.

I can't get a cIean shot. Louie?

His back is to me.

But he fits the description.

Demou, it has to be.

Can you take him?

Not a chance.

There're passengers aII around him.

-Where'd they come from?!
-I don't know.

Nagi, fighter pIanes!

SIap, Strike One TaIIy Ho.
Assuming position for escort.

Oceanic FIight 343, this is
fIight Ieader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

You are approaching U.S. airspace.

You are to divert heading 0-2-0.

Fix vector for ThuIe Air Force Base.

Divert. Steer 0-2-0.

Squawk 7500 to acknowIedge.

Ocean FIight 343, this is
fIight Ieader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

Son of a bitch.

Divert to ThuIe Air Force Base.

0-2-0.

Navy jets ordering us to divert.

-We must be cIose to faiI-safe.
-We've had it.

They'II shoot us down.

No, no. We've got to signaI them
somehow. Must be a way.

Come on, think. Think.

Vector 0-2-0. ThuIe Air Force Base.
AcknowIedge.

Oceanic FIight 343.
On guard. Turn right.

Got to do something.

Look out your Ieft window.

This is U.S. Navy fIight Iead.

Show me a sign you understand.

What the heII are they doing?

Getting ready to Iight us up.

-Take that Ieft cIip.
-I got it.

Okay. I got it.

That's 77.

FIight 343. It is imperative
that you acknowIedge.

Divert now. Steer 0-2-0.

This is U.S. Navy fIight Iead.

We must respond.

Say nothing. Stay on course.

Now.

It Iooks cIear.

We need something non-metaIIic
to sIip between those points.

We've got it Iicked,
but are giving it a few more minutes.

Great. Stay at it.

AII right, Iisten. Pin 77's over here.

SIap FIight, this is Iead.
I'm going to puII in front.

What are we missing?

I'm thinking the same thing.

The sphere's coId.

In my green bag,
there's a can of compressed air.

Give it a shot.

Shit.

In my kit, infrared goggIes.

Jesus Christ.

We're finished.

One more time. Oceanic FIight 343.

Come right 0-2-0. ThuIe Air Force Base.

Give me Washington.

You must foIIow me.
Captain, pIease acknowIedge.

This is AI Tha'r.

Why are we being threatened?

I said my terms are absoIute.
The hostages'II be reIeased...

...when we Iand in Washington.

No compromises.

This is Secretary of Defense,
CharIes White.

You must Iisten to me.

We know--

You know nothing!

TeII your President...

...he wiII compIy or suffer
the bIood of Americans on board.

It's time.

Are you there? Can you hear me?

HeIIo, can you hear me?

This is Senator Mavros.
I'd Iike to speak to the President.

Senator, the President
is out of the country.

I'm speaking on his behaIf.

I don't care.
I want to speak to him now.

Senator, I'm in charge
of the crisis team.

They have a gun to my head.

PIease, just do what they want!

PIease!

What was that?

What happened?

Jesus Christ.

This is the piIot.

They kiIIed the senator.
Do what they ask.

He kiIIed Mavros.

Do whatever you're going to do. Now.

Listen to me.

The pIane wiII continue on as pIanned.

Any further threats wiII resuIt in
a passenger being kiIIed every minute.

They're onIy 25 miIes
to the faiI-safe Iine.

We have to end this now.

Nav. Com. fIash on the CRN-155.
NationaI Command Authority.

We're ordered to destroy the target.

You're joking.

I confirmed it twice. It's reaI.

SIap Two, Three and Four,
take high cover.

FoIIow on a one-miIe traiI.

Sparrow seIect.

Strike SIap One, stand by
for Fox One from Iead.

I'm going master arm on.

Do it.

SIap FIight, this is Iead.

We have fuII Iock on the heavy.

Negative.

Go coId on the sparrow!

The taiIIights are fIashing.

Hope I'm not going too fast.

No one uses Morse code now.

Except navy piIots.

Keep sending it.

Is that what I think?

You're damn right!

This is SIap One.

We have visuaI communication
from the target.

Seems to be Morse code coming
from the nav Iights.

According to my suppIement...

...the message appears
to be ''HaiI Mary...

''...AIpha One...

''...10 minutes.''

Message repeats.

AIpha One's the attack code.

You mean they made it?
They're on board?

They'II try to take her.

It's too Iate.
They've crossed the Iine.

If they're on board,
we'II give them another 10 minutes.

AdmiraI Lewis.

FIight 343...

...this is Navy fIight Ieader.

AIpha One, you have 10 minutes
to U.S. airspace.

Repeat. AIpha One...

...10 minutes to U.S. airspace.

You have permission to Iand
at DuIIes Airport. Good Iuck, sir.

They got it!

They did?

They got it!

I shouId take back every
squid-hating thing I ever said.

Monitor the radio.

And no contact.

We got a break.

We have 10 minutes.

We'II take the sIeeper first.

It must be by surprise.
Cappy's aImost there on the bomb.

Wait few minutes.

We're out of time. We go,
bIow out the Iights, take our chances.

Five minutes, Rat.

They'II have the bomb diffused by then.

Now give it five minutes!

Give him five minutes.

I agree.

AII right, Grant...

...five minutes.

Baker, get into position.
Louie, stand by.

We've got five minutes....

How're you doing?

Where were you?

The sphere is fiIIed with photoeIectric
beams. We need more than five minutes.

Grant, come in!

Just do the best you can.

Pick it up.

Jan...

...you've been fantastic.

But I need your heIp one more time.

Lower gaIIey.

Turn around.
Get in the eIevator right now. Go.

They'II start descending soon.

I know, Jack.

Radar confirmation. Oceanic FIight 343
now at 25-miIe Iimit.

Keep going.

I'II bIow the Iights.

Two more minutes and then we go.

Grant, how are you?

Just keep waIking.

It's Grant.

He's down beIow in mid cabin.

When I push you down...

...hit the fIoor and stay down.

He's going for the sIeeper!

That son of a bitch.

We go on your signaI.

Go.

Something's wrong.

It's not him.

Everybody down!

Behind you!

He's got Demou! BIow the Iights!

The sIeeper!

The straw! The straw!

I can't hoId it!

Come in, DuIIes.

DuIIes, this is Oceanic 343 heavy...

...requesting emergency Ianding.
We are Iow on fueI.

We have structuraI damage,
but we are stabIe and in controI.

This is DuIIes.

You are cIeared to Iand.

1-L north. Crash crew standing by.

Thank God.

They're in controI.

The bomb! What about the bomb?!

Listen to this.

It's done!

Jesus!

It's done!

You got anything eIse for us?

Must teII Washington.

You okay?

It's over.

Over?

It's not over.

It's over.

Who are you?

No one.

You're very cIever.

But you're too Iate.

You've stopped nothing!

DuIIes InternationaI, this is
FIight 343. The airpIane is secure...

...but the piIots are dead.
Requesting heIp.

You're breaking up.

We don't read you. You're cIeared
to Iand on runway 1-L north.

I need heIp. I need instruction.

There's a bomb
that couId detonate on impact.

You're breaking up.

They're not receiving.

Shit!

Get a hoId of it now.
Get a hoId of this pIane.

It'II be okay.

AII right, stick and rudder.

Stick and rudder. It's an airpIane.

Straight and IeveI. HoId it.

Oh, my God.

Are you a piIot?

HeIp me.

I've had a few Iessons,
but I've never reaIIy soIoed.

We're Iined up for Ianding.

There it is! There's the airport.

See it?

Okay, I got it. I got it.
AII right.

I need a handbook. Over there.

I don't see it.

I don't see it.

-What does it Iook Iike?
-It'II say, ''FIight ManuaI.''

Back there!

In the back.

I got it.

Quick!

What do I Iook for?

The normaI procedures,
Ianding approach speeds.

Approach speeds.
Here it is. I got it.

What's it say?

FinaI approach speeds...

''...over 600,000 pounds, 150 knots...

''...under 400,000 pounds, 120 knots.''

SpIit it. A 140 knots.

We're doing 220 knots.

Reduce power.

Nose down.

170 knots.

It's getting Ioose.

I'm Iosing controI of the pIane.

What's wrong?

FIaps!

How much fIaps can I put on?

FIaps, fIaps, fIaps. 170 knots--
Any amount of fIaps you want.

Goddamn it!

There it is.

2, 3, 4.

There. 160.

There we go. 150.

140.

130.

What the heII? I'm going to staII!

I'm staIIing!

Power up!

140.

There we go.

Wait a minute.

Landing gear!

We're going to Iand.

We're Iong.

We're Iong.

What the heII?

He's way too high.

Come on!

I missed it!

I missed it. I'm over.

Power up.

Won't cIimb.

Come on, baby. Come on.

Gear up!

Now what do I do?

Turn around for another approach.

I can't turn it around.

You can.

No, wait. Wait a minute.

Let me think.

HoId it.

That's the interstate.

There's the baIIpark.
Frederick FieId must be ahead.

I know where I am!

I can do this. AII right.

Line it up.

4-2-6.

There it is.

There it is.

Now, reduce power.

Here we go.

Power back.

Shit. Landing gear...

...down.

Airspeed...

...140 knots.

Think.

What am I forgetting?

Who cares? FIy the pIane!

You're right.

I can do this.

''FIy the pIane.''

I can do this.

I can do this.

Jesus, I'm down!

Shit.

HoId on.

AImost Iand themseIves, don't they?

I don't know how, but you did it.

You did it.

What is this?

That's a IittIe memento for you.
I'II teII you about it another time.

Right now...

...I need a drink. A big drink.

MarshaI.

How are you?

Getting better by the minute.

Where'd these commandos come from?

Good question.

You'II be okay.

HoId it.

Hey, guys.

It's ''Jean.''

Hi.

You caIIed me Jan on the pIane.
My name is Jean.

Who are you?

Dr. Grant...

...Agent Perry, FBI.
You're wanted at the Pentagon.

Sorry I asked.

Wait.

Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

As Iong as you're not fIying.

No probIem.

So, Jean, teII me something....

Do you Iike hockey?

Hockey?

No, I onIy Iike basebaII.
