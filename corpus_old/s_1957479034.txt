[subway whirring]

[concessions cart] Cameron Turner, my man.

Let me guess. Latte, oat milk, no sugar.

Spot on, sir.

Uh, I'll take an Echo bar
if you've got any.

{\an8}Echo's my middle name. Will that be all?

{\an8}[Cameron] That's good, thank you.

All right. [chimes]
Payment taken. Order coming up.


[concessions cart] Ta-da.


You're welcome, Cameron.
Okay, good talk. We'll see you tomorrow.

[subway announcer]
<i>Step down from the train.</i>

[passenger speaking French]

Look, I know my brother, all right?
He's very sensitive.

[speaks French]

[speaks French]

[speaks French]




[passenger chuckles]

[clears throat]

[clears throat]


Hello?

Hey. Yeah.

[speaks French]

[subway chimes]

No.
Uh, we're pulling into the station now.

[subway announcer]
<i>This station is Summit Park.</i>

I'll see you in a bit, okay? All right.


It's all yours.


-[subway chimes]
-[chuckles]

[subway announcer]
<i>The train is now arriving at Summit Park.</i>

[subway rattles]


[subway chimes]
<i>The next station is Stadium Avenue.</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, no.


Oh, shit.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.



-[line beeps]
<i>-Hi, Cameron. Dr. Scott here.</i>

<i>Look, I don't wanna add
any more strain on you,</i>

<i>but with your latest scan
showing an accelerating deterioration,</i>

<i>it's vital that we keep moving forward
with--</i>

Mute.


["Quarrel" playing]

Pig. You out here?

Ah. Good boy, now.

You guys save me some food?

Yeah? You didn't eat all my food today?


<i>Child prodigy or future serial killer?</i>

<i>Can't wait for parent-teacher night.</i>




-[beeps]
-[music ends]




[breathing deeply]



[water running]

[gasps, breathes heavily]

[exhales sharply, grunts]

Welcome to Arra House, Cameron.
Good to meet you in person.

Come in.

This is our main living area.

Wow.

[Dr. Scott] I know that
some of these concepts are uncomfortable.

Just remember that
if you decide not to proceed

at any point in the evaluation process,
he never leaves this facility.

And there's--
there's no way he gets this thing?

As outlined, we modified
the relevant strands of his DNA

to prevent that happening again.

And what happens to him
if I decide not to do this? He just--

He goes to sleep that night unaware.
Doesn't know a thing.

We'll be calling him Jack for now,
if that name's okay with you.

[door chimes]

This is the control room.

And this is Dalton.

-Welcome, Cameron.
-Hello.

[Dr. Scott] He's a psychologist
and the head technician.

And that completes our team.

It's just three of you?

Three humans. Our AI systems
do the work of about 50 people.

Oh.

Before we let you in,

we'll need you to disable the cameras
in your contacts and your watch.

Oh, okay. Umâ€¦

-Disable cameras.
-[beeps]

Thank you.


[Dr. Scott] Molecularly regenerated.

Mapped to your DNA.

Cameron Turner to the molecule.

Is he dreaming?

Not yet.

Go ahead. He can't wake.

I'm sorry, Doctor.

I can't do this.

[line beeps]

[Dr. Scott] <i>I know
what a momentous decision this is for you.</i>

-[sighs]
<i>-I know what you're going through.</i>

<i>But justâ€¦</i>

<i>the second you tell your wife
that you're dying,</i>

<i>your opportunity to do this is gone.</i>

<i>You can tell her,</i>

<i>or you can do this with us
and let life go on for your family.</i>

<i>But given your worsening condition,
we can't afford to delay, Cameron.</i>

<i>-Please call me.</i>
-[beeps]


Excellent. And this one?

Cory?

Hooded mergant.

-[Cory's mom speaks French]
-[chuckles]

[Cory speaks French]

No. [chuckles] No.

[speaking French]

[speaks French]




[video game beeping]


-Oh, you eyeing my pencils now?
-[Cory] Uh-huh.

The same set I've had for 22 years.
You're eyeing my pencils?

You ain't using 'em.

"Ain't"? When did we start saying "ain't"?

You don't use 'em since Andre died.

[dishes clatter]

<i>Cam, what's with you lately?</i> [sighs]

<i>Look, I know you're an artist
and this is painful for you. I get it.</i>

<i>But this is a health-focused organic tea.</i>

<i>It's not some fucking ayahuasca brew
we're designing.</i>

<i>When you follow along with what
the client wants, you kill it, you know?</i>

<i>So just play ball. Okay?</i>

-All right.
-<i>Love ya. Bye.</i>

[line beeps]

["Running" playing on speakers]

[Pig whimpers]

Hmm. You want one of these?


[computer chimes]





{\an8}-[Cory's mom] <i>Uncle Andre.</i>
-[Andre] <i>Cory, can you say "Uncle Andre"?</i>

-[Cory exclaims]
-Oh!

-Ow!
-[all laugh]

[Cory laughing]

That is cloning, by the way.

-[Andre] No! No, no, no, no, no.
-Yeah.

No, technically speaking, it's not.
The article said it's not.

It's-- It's regeneration.

It doesn't matter what you call it, Andre.
It's still weird.

I don't care
how good they say the tech's gonna be.

You'd know
it wasn't a real person in seconds.

Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically speaking,

what if it was actually possible?
What if they did actually work it out?

-[speaks French]
-[Andre speaks French]

They won't, Andre. 'Cause you can't
copy a human being. You can't.

[Andre groans, speaks French]

-Cameron?
-No. I-- No, I'm staying way out of this.

Oh, come on.

[Cameron chuckles]

Nothing like a good death chat
first thing in the morning.

-[Andre] Okay.
-[Cory giggles]

-[laughs] Is that funny?
-Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

Look, if Mom could be sitting here
right now with us,

and, like, you know, we couldn't tell,
she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

You know, screw the ethics.
I would take that.

I mean-- I mean, that being said,

if they happen to delete
her fondness for yacht rock,

-I would not be devastated.
-[Andre] Yes.

Going crazy.
Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

There it is.


[slams table]


[Dr. Scott] I know how you're feeling,
but there is no lie.

When the memory of this process
gets wiped,

he wakes up that day at home
as Cameron Turner.

And no one knows. Not even him.

It's the only way this works.
A clean swap.

How many others are out there?
I wanna know.

You'll be our third.

This will be as common
as a heart transplant within a few years.

Come back and spend a week with him
before making your decision.

This is not just my decision.
My wife needs to know.

Either you decide that your wife would
want this, which requires secrecy,

or you decide that she wouldn't,
and tell her you're dying.

Either way, you're deciding for her.

{\an8}Listen, the woman you're about to meet
has no idea she's a duplicate.

<i>Neither does her daughter,
her mother, or her friends.</i>

{\an8}<i>So, where is the lie?</i>

[door closes]

Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

Yeah, uh, Cameron.

Browsing for a three-bed
in the neighborhood?

Oh, yeah.

[video game beeping]

This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

I'm her daughter.

-Mm-hmm, daughter.
-[chuckles]

She runs a tight ship.

Anyway, have a seat.

I had some good ones
come in today, actually.

You said in your message
you had a son, right?

Yeah. Cory.

He runs the show as well?

Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.


[no audible dialogue]

[Poppy vocalizing]


[Poppy continues vocalizing]

-Hey.
-Hey.

[music plays]

[Poppy vocalizing on speakers]

-Yeah?
-Yeah.


Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

Mmm.

-You taking a break?
-Yeah.

[music continues]

-[beep, music ends]
-Mmm.

So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert
for the ultrasound.

Mmm.

I'm just waiting for them to confirm,
but it's looking good.

Yeah.

Mm-hmm.


Are you bracing yourself
for sexy bowling ball bod?

[both chuckle]

I still can't believe it.

We're gonna fall in love
with a new little person again.

Seven months.


-[breathes shakily]
-What's up, Cam?

Mmm. Mm-mmm.

I'm good. It's just, umâ€¦

It's just, umâ€¦

[inhales sharply]

So, we, umâ€¦

Cameron?

Umâ€¦

It's just, a new little person. And, umâ€¦

I think that's just sinking in still,
you know.

[breathing shakily]


Cam.

Cam.

I know it took me a minute,

and I know we haven't been us for a while,

but this baby is going to be good for us.

Yeah.

We're gonna be okay. All right?

Mm-hmm.


[line ringing]

[Cory speaks indistinctly]

[ringing continues]

[Dr. Scott] <i>Cameron?</i>


M-Mind if I sit?


Hi. I'm-- I'm Cameron.

Kate.

So, you met her?

Yesterday.

How's she doing?

Good. I guess.

She try to sell you a house?

Mmm. Condo.

It's what we do.

Mmm.


<i>And the clients just spring this on you
today, zero notice?</i>

<i>What's going on, Cam?</i>

Nothing.

The designer they had got sick last minute
and they needed someone here in person.

Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

I wish I didn't have to be away right now.
Believe me.

[television playing]

<i>All right. Well, I'd better get back here.</i>

-<i>I'll speak to you later, yeah?</i>
-All right.



You'll be out for the entire process.
It'll take about six hours.


[Dr. Scott] Every single memory

right up to the moment
you lose consciousness in that chair.

you're gonna go under.

Okay. I-I think I--

I thi-- [sighs]

[overlapping chatter]

[video camera rolling]

Like, you having a moment.
You having a day.

[overlapping chatter]

[chattering stops]

[footsteps approaching]

Thank you.

So, he has everything?

Mm-hmm. Even the memories
you've stored deep in your subconscious.

they're not just mine.

They're my-- my wife's, my son's.

Not part of some experiment.

I just wish I could talk to her.

When they sent "me 2.0" back,

seeing my mom look into her eyes
not knowing it wasn't me,

seeing her talking to my daughterâ€¦

I meanâ€¦

And then when they wiped herâ€¦

knowing she was no longer in on the lie,
my guilt faded pretty quick.

We share an oncologist, you know?

Dr. Kerosima?

Yep.

The patient before me
was a patient of hers too.

She seemed happy, your daughter.
They both did.

Yeah?

How long has she been out there?

Roughlyâ€¦

forty-two days, six hours.

Roughly?

Ballpark.

[Cameron laughs]

[Dr. Scott] Memory cross-checks
allow us to make sure

that his conscious
and subconscious memories

are perfectly in sync with yours.

It will feel strange at first.

Just try to stay in each memory.

In your own time, Cameron.

{\an8}-[overlapping chattering]
-[Cameron's parent] Cameron.


Cameron, I like your picture.

-[Dr. Scott] Breathe.
-[breathes deeply]

It feels real because as far as
your brain is concerned, it is real.

Just, uh, skipped way back.

That's normal.

As it progresses,
the system will test any point in time

all the way back to birth.

to stay in the memories

and not break the flow, okay?

Okay. Okay.


from a few weeks back?</i>


See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

And I'm-- I'm hoping
you worked that out by now. Yeah.

Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face
when you realized. [laughs]

-[chuckles] Not a strong moment for me.
-[Poppy chuckles]

Oh, I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

and I-- I-- I made this thing.


Here you go.


Wow! Wow, you're good.

Oh, thank you. Uh, I realize now

that even makes me look
more like a psycho.

-Oh, yeah? [laughs]
-But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

A talented psycho is better
than a talentless one, soâ€¦ [chuckles]

Yeah. I appreciate that.

I'm-- I'm Cameron, by the way.

Cameron. Poppy.

Poppy.

-Pleasure.
-[chuckles]


Oh, okay. Um, all right.
Well, I'll let you go.

Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

-Um, I hope to see you around.
-[subway chimes]

<i>-The next station is Summit Park.</i>
-All right, best wishes.

[clicks tongue] Best wishes.

-Hey, Cameron?
-Hmm?

Um, here.

Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

Give it to me again.

Okay.

[Poppy chuckles]

Oh!

Poppy.

[overlapping chatter]

[Poppy vocalizing]

["Moon River" playing]

[speaks French]

[Poppy chuckling]

-Yeah? Are you scared yet?
-[Poppy chuckles] I'm a little bit scared.

Like, there's a lot going on there.

[Poppy and Cameron laugh]

You mean that awful thing
I made the other day?

-Oh!
-[Poppy] Yes!

Let me out.

You hold on a little bit.
I'm not ready for you.

-[Cameron chuckles]
-[Cory coos]

We've been waiting so long for you.</i>

You're so sweet.</i>

-[Cory exclaims]
-[all laugh]


I don't wanna look at you.
It makes me laugh.

-[Cameron laughs]
-Mommy.

-I'm not going back in.
-It's okay.

[music ends]


<i>and she was crying,
and she looked really sad.</i>

-[Andre exclaims]
-Is it because of Andre?

Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

Hey, Andre.

-[sobbing] I should have stopped him.
-No, no, no, no.

I should have stopped him. [sobbing]

It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

[inhales sharply, grunts]

Oh. [pants] I--

You good, Cameron?

-I'm sorry. I-I need a second.
-All right.

All right. Let's go.

[breathing heavily]


so we can hang out when I get back.

from your desk for the last six months.</i>

<i>Suddenly you're gung-ho
to drop everything.</i>



-<i>You good?</i>
-Yeah. Yes.

<i>Yeah?</i>

-[chuckles]
-<i>Are you sure you're happy about this?</i>

<i>Yeah. The last couple of weeks you justâ€¦</i>

I don't know. Just--

Uh, hey, P. I'm fine.
It's just work. I'm working.

Iâ€¦ I just hate being away from you.
That's all.

<i>And I just miss us.</i>

<i>When I get home, we're gonna hang out
and talk for real, okay?</i>


-[chuckles]
-[Cameron chuckles]

Oh, my God.

Okay, you're definitely taking the blame
for this specimen.

Uh, no.
I believe Cory picked that out himself.

-[Poppy] What? At three months?
<i>-Uh, yeah. Because I was with him.</i>

-[laughs]
-<i>We were in the store walking around,</i>

and I'm pushing him in the stroller.
And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

You see that yellow mustard onesie
right there?

-I need that in my life."
-[laughing]

Yeah, he's so charming. I was like,
"Hey, what do you say to that?"

[both laugh]

Yeah, he is very charming.
I'll give you that.

-<i>But this is criminal.</i> [chuckles]
-Hmm.

me and you will take care of her</i>

<i>till she can take care of herself again.
All right?</i>

Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay?
She's just sick right now.

Go away.


-[Cory moans]
-[roars]


-[Cameron] Six more hours?
-Mm-hmm.

It's still dark outside. Look!

'Cause it's early.
But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

Let this hand go. There, boom.

-And now flick it. Follow through.
-Boom.

[speaks French]

[imitates whoosh]

I used to do this all day in my room.

-That smells so good.
-You think?

-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint.
-[laughs] Yes. All right.

Dip 'em in a little--
a little soy sauce. [pops lips]

Blip. Blip. Bloop.

-[Cameron] Blip, bloop.
-[Cory] Blipâ€¦

[Cameron and Cory chattering]

I'm standing by up here.</i>



Okay. [sighs] We're ready to go up here.

[Cameron sighs]

All right.

Okay.

Keep your eyes closed.

I'm gonna count you down from three.

And on threeâ€¦

And twoâ€¦

And one.

[inhales sharply]

[breathing heavily, gasping]

You're okay.

[Dr. Scott] Breathe.

-That's it?
-[technician] That's it.

Everything go okay?

Everything went great.

When will I see him?

In the morning.

Until then, you should get some sleep.

[Dr. Scott] <i>For the time
that you are in this facility,</i>

that freckle is the only place
on your entire body

that isn't identical to his.

If you get confused,

you find that freckle
and you'll know who you are. Okay?

We know how strange this is.


[Dr. Scott] You got the good deal here.

You'll see.

-[Cory] <i>Boom!</i> [grunts] Again.
-[cheering on video game]

-[Cameron] Little chin music.
-[Cory] <i>You're going down.</i>

You don't know nothing about this, boy.

-<i>Ooh!</i>
-Mm-mmm.

-[Cory grunts]
-You too young.

Uh-uh. Uh-uh, chump.



<i>Boom!</i>

-Oh! That's just another cheap left.
-[Cory] <i>Yeah, baby!</i>

[grunts, breathes shakily]


-[Cory] <i>Dad?</i>
-[Cameron grunting, chokes]

-[Dalton] <i>Hey, Cameron?</i>
-[Dr. Scott] <i>Talk to me, Cameron.</i>

-[Dalton] <i>No.</i>
-[Dr. Scott] <i>Send Poppy a message.</i>



any of these seizures could kill me.</i>

And I could die out here this week
before getting home to see them.

I can't stop picturing her
getting the news, having to tell Cory.

Poppy and I had been
going through some stuff.

The other night I made her laugh.

I can't remember
the last time I did that, you know?

Just made her laugh.

That's because you're not funny.


Yeah, that too.

Those things will kill you, you know.

Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.



We're ready for you.


See you later.



she'll just drift off in seconds,

like, out like a light.

[Dr. Scott] Poppy speaks French?

the occasional French word.

Like, she'll say, uhâ€¦ [speaks French]

Or umâ€¦

[speaks French]

Or if something is great,
like, just perfect,

she might whisper, uhâ€¦

[speaks French]

[Jack chuckles]

[speaks French]

[Dr. Scott] You wanna go say hi?


You okay?

After last night?

Good.

I don't know how to, uhâ€¦

Uh, what to say here.

I know you don't think I'mâ€¦

You. Uhâ€¦

I'm sitting up in that room,
looking at Rafa.

out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.</i>

I'm really nervous.

Then Dad pops in my head.

That first trip out to see him
after they split.

Getting on that airplane.

Just the nerves, you know?

And I close my eyes.

And then I open 'em.

[inhales sharply]

in that room anymore.

I'm here.

I am here.

I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[exhales slowly]

[Dr. Scott] He knows you're nervous, Jack.

Just answer the questions.

-[AR assistant] <i>Audio muted.</i>
-[Dr. Scott] Cameronâ€¦

you're you.

There are no wrong answers.

[AR assistant] <i>Audio unmuted.</i>

[Dr. Scott] Okay, Jack.
Poppy works with children.

kids with learning difficulties

through, uh, music therapy.

She's got her own take
on the Orff Schulwerk method.

So, um, she makes songs with the kids,
and she puts them in the songs.

Andâ€¦ they love it.

Mmm. She's just insanely talented.

She cares. You know?
Like, she really cares.

[Dr. Scott] <i>Did you always want children?</i>

[Poppy hums]


Ah, I like this, Cameron Turner.

I think after I met Poppy,
I realized I wanted kids.

-I like all of this.
-[Cameron chuckles]

-Yeah.
-[Poppy chuckles]


Wow. Oh, my gosh.

We have scarily similar taste in books.

{\an8}[Jack] <i>This idea
of finding true love or a soul mate.</i>

and you realize you're just surviving.</i>

Do you play?

Uh, I butcher.

But I-- I'm not playing in front of you.

just gone on like that forever.

And think about what you doing</i> â™ª

-[laughs] Oh, I love it. Yes.
-[Poppy laughs]

I just lucked out, I guess.

[Dr. Scott] Good.

[Dr. Scott] Talk about
your parents' relationship.

much to talk about.

They divorced when I was five,
and my dad moved away for work.

He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

[waves lapping]

He looks like me.
He sounds like me, but I don't knowâ€¦

In seven months, that child is gonna
come into the world without a dad.

Seven months.

Hey. At least you're not
feeling sorry for yourself.


You're gonna be good, man.

That's fair.

And what about you? How you doing?

Me?

Never better.

Any other great questions?

No. Okay.


Having the time of my life out here.

-[Cameron laughs]
-Nature's awesome. Great food.

[Cameron laughs]

Cameron?

Make it obscure.



-Probably not. It's probably--
-Oh, God. What?

-[Cameron] Lift your feet up high.
-Lift my feet up where?

-[Cameron] And step. Step. Step.
-[Andre] Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

-There we go. There you go.
-[Poppy laughs]

We're safe. We're safe.


-Oh! You got me a piano!
-[claps]


Andre!

Oh, my God.

-Thank you so much.
-[Jack] <i>And he was so like Poppy.</i>

<i>Like, just wildly smart and gentle.</i>

[Dr. Scott] What happened to him?

Andre, uhâ€¦ was thrown from his bike
off of a mountain road.

His body landed in the branches
of a pine tree, high up.

about him up there in the treetops.</i>

[no audible dialogue]


[Dr. Scott] Have you talked to your wife
about that dream?

No.

Why not?

She didn't leave the house
for the better part of a year.

Slept in the guest room
most of that time, soâ€¦

I'm just trying to help you.


I know, I know.

-I need to be alone. Thank you.
-Please--

It's not really subject matter
we enjoy getting into.

[Dr. Scott] How did Poppy sleeping apart
make you feel?

Alone.

Mostly, I worried about her.

I missed her.

[Dr. Scott] Did you resent her for it?

-[Jack] <i>She lost her twin.</i>
-[Poppy sobbing]

about him getting that motorcycle.</i>

<i>Blamed herself for not protesting more.</i>

<i>But he was gonna get the bike anyway.</i>

[Dr. Scott] You've mentioned how well
Poppy has progressed with her therapist

over the last few months.

But you never went to see anybody?


[Dr. Scott] Did you talk to someone
after your parents were divorced?

[Jack chuckling] No, I was five.

[Dr. Scott]
So you've never been to a therapist?


[Dr. Scott] And you can't talk to Poppy
about this dream that you keep having?

It's been two years.
Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

I don't know.

[Dr. Scott] Cameron?

I'm sorry, I--

I'm sorry.

[Dr. Scott] It's okay.

Let's take a break.

Saving them for you.

[Dr. Scott] <i>All right.</i>

Jack, are you ready?

Yeah.

-[Dr. Scott] Cameron?
-Yeah.

All right.

[Dr. Scott] Call Poppy, please.

[line ringing]

<i>This is weird timing.
I just spoke to the clinic.</i>

<i>Doctor Herbert is confirmed
for the ultrasound on the 25th.</i>

<i>Cam?</i>

That's real.

<i>Yeah. So real. Living human in body.</i>

to how I remember it with Cory, right?

<i>Yeah.</i>

Remember how we found out?

[Poppy chuckles] <i>Oh, my God, yeah.
That insane snow.</i>

<i>Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.</i>


-<i>"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."</i>
-[both laugh]


You were barely
out of the doctor's office,

you were already making a playlist,
holding the speaker there.

[Poppy laughs] <i>Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.</i>

Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

<i>Mmm. Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.</i>


[Dr. Scott] Rafa, send Poppy a message.

-What did you do?
-I don't like this.

And you think I like this?
Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

She's not your wife!

Oh, okay. Okay, I see. [chuckles]

You can't bear to see this actually work.
That's the real problem.

-Fuck you, man!
-Fuck you!

And what about me?
Waking up in this place,

waiting for you to pull the plug,
being told I'm not me.

Because you're not me.

You are not me! [panting]

You know what? Fuck all this.

-No, bullshit. You stay right here.
-This is bullshit! Fuck that!

-[Jack] Stay here. Bullshit. This is real.
-Open the fucking door!

And you know it. You know it.

Poppy said if she couldn't tell,
if her mom was indistinguishableâ€¦

Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

You won't go through with it
because you're too selfish!

Get the fuck off me.

I'm done with you. Huh?

Do something?
Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

Yeah. You won't leave this place.

I'm going home, and I'm telling them
everything. Everything!

Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

It's always about you.
It's always about you.

She's been trying to talk
for I don't know how long,

and you keep shutting her out,

because deep down inside,
you feel like she abandoned us.

-I never thought that! I never!
-[Jack] You did!

-You did--
-[grunts]

Hey, hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

It's okay. It's okay. Breathe, breathe.

-[Cameron breathing heavily]
-Cam?

[breathing heavily]

What the fuck, man?



I'll talk to him,
but it's in his contract.

I need to see him.

I remember when I knew
she was gonna be okay.

[piano playing]


â™ª <i>I wanted to see him again</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>But sometimes
Sometimes life ain't always the way</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sometimes it snows in April</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sometimes I feel so bad</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>So bad</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sometimes I wish life is never-ending</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And all good things
They say never last</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It isn't hard till it's passed</i> â™ª

[music ends]

Hey, uhâ€¦ I'm really sorry about earlier.

I don't think she abandoned us.

No, there's something to it.

There's something to it.

She'd been trying to talk to me
for a long time in her own way.

Thought I had more time, I guess.

I just told her about that dizzy spell
three months ago.

If I'd had mentioned
the headache back then--

She'd have marched us in
for a scan that day.

And got to it before it spread.

Dealt with it together.

[both sigh]

I know you got to go back
and see them. I get it.

Do the right thing here.

In seven months, that baby--

Don't do that.

If you tell her, you're saying it for you.
I'm saying that for them.

Enough.

[door opens]


-Hey, Jack.
-[gasps]

Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay.

-[breathing heavily] Oh, shit.
-You're okay.

You're okay.

Yeah.

while you're back at home</i>

<i>is an important part
of Jack's psychological evaluation.</i>

Nothing's ever recorded?

That's the policy.

Mmm. And, uh, only Jack
has access to this feed?

No one sees or hears a thing.

[Cameron sighs]

Access granted.

<i>Now, try your best
to forget about all this,</i>

<i>and just enjoy your time with them.</i>

We'll see you in three days, Cameron.

Try to put everything out of your mind.
Just enjoy your time at home.

Do come back.

["Doomed" playing]

[music continues]

[music ends]

[grunting and groaning]



Oh, my God.

-[Cameron grunting and panting]
-[Dr. Scott] Call him. Send a car.

Oh, my God.

Pick up.

[Dr. Scott] <i>Cameron, there will be
a car there in a moment. Try to stand up.</i>


-[car approaching]
-[grunting and groaning]

-[grunts]
-[Dr. Scott] <i>Cameron?</i>

<i>We're gonna need you to come back.</i>

I just got home.

We might just need to
change your medication,

but we gotta have a look at you.


If you stay and you have
another seizure without supervision,

<i>you could die in front of your family.</i>

Fuck you.

Fuck. Fuck.

Cameron?

[Cameron grunting and groaning]

[Dr. Scott] <i>Cameron, talk to me.</i>

Jack goes in the morning.

I haven't finished evaluating
his psychological state yet.

I'm not comfortable with Jack going home.

Poppy's expecting him back.

-I have--
-Jack is ready. He goes first thing.

We're covered for this in the contract.

It will be noted
that you opposed the decision.

Tell Jack to call Poppy now.

Mild concussion. Scan was all good.

Home tomorrow.

All right.

[Dr. Scott] If these two weeks
at home go well, which they will,

your memory of this process
will be removed

and we will not see you here again.

If Cameron wakes up,
he will monitor your lens feed.

But unless there are any issues
over the next two weeks,

he will not have the option to stop this.

I know this isn't as we planned it,
but you're ready, Jack.

Don't think of these two weeks as a test.

Just going home.


-[Poppy] Bear? Let me see you.
-[footsteps approaching]

Are you okay?

-Just-- Just a little bit sore. I'm fine.
-Yeah? [gasps]

The swelling's gone down.

What did they say?

Mmm, I'll be a little bit fuzzy
for a few days. But I'm good.

-[Poppy sighs]
-Come here.

Aw.

[Jack sighs]


-<i>I scared me.</i> [chuckles]
-[chuckles, sniffles]

He's waiting for you up in his room.

-Who?
-[chuckles] Your son.

Shut up.

-[laughs]
-Asshole. [sighs]

I'm sorry, I had to.

Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

-Aw.
-Wanker.

-Come here.
-No.

Come here. Come here.

-No way. [chuckles]
-I'm sorry.

[Jack moans]

-[sighs]
-Mmm.


[both chuckling]

[Pig barking]

Pig.


Hey, pal.

Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

for leaving town
and hitting your head. [chuckles]

Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

-[Ellington barks]
-Okay, Pig. Uh--

I'll stick him outside.

I'll go check on Doc.

[Poppy chuckles]

[Ellington barking]

[breathing heavily]


[breathing heavily] Ra-- What happened?

You passed out.

You've been unconscious
for almost 24 hours.

What does Poppy think?

Everything's fine, Cameron.

What does that mean?

He's not gone.

We've been monitoring it all
while you were out. Everything's good.

No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

I'm so sorry that it happened this wayâ€¦

I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

-â€¦but it was the right decision.
-Bullshit.

I'm not done!

Well, it's not about you now.

Excuse me?

-You have an opportunity that no one gets.
-No. No, no, no.

Don't be blind, Cameron.

-Fuck you.
-You're dying.

You're dying.

-You're dying, Cam--
-Stop!

Stop.

Jack was ready.

They're in good hands.

They're in your hands.

I wanna see the video.

Now.

And you need to stop watching my family.

Paper is wood.</i>

[Jack chuckles] <i>Yes.</i>

-<i>It's got some-- Let me see.</i>
-<i>Is it?</i>


-[Cory chuckles] <i>Yeah.</i> Yes, sir.
-[Jack chuckles]

-[Cameron] This the only feed?
-[Jack] <i>Mmm. Okay.</i>


I'd like to be alone.


I've been trying to get you to do more of?</i>

-<i>Read?</i>
-<i>Ah. Good.</i>

<i>Here's a little something for you.</i>

<i>Essentially, it's from your grandmother.</i>

<i>It's something she gave to me
when I was about your age.</i>

<i>Open it up, it's a good one.</i>



[rain pattering]

for doing this to our books</i>

<i>-when we were growing up.</i>
-[Jack chuckles]

every word he underlined.</i>

[Poppy chuckles, sniffs]

<i>Somehow I'm--</i>

<i>Somehow I'm finally breathing again.</i>

<i>But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.</i>

in a job you hate.</i>

<i>It's like you're not here.</i>

<i>And I'm not saying you're fully to blame,
you know?</i> <i>We're both in this.</i>

<i>I know I checked out for a while.</i>

<i>And I know that scared you.</i>

<i>And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.</i>

[Poppy crying, sniffing]

<i>I mean, hearing you say the words,
"I hit my head," the other dayâ€¦</i>

<i>I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.</i>

<i>So this is me telling you
that I'm done with the silence now.</i>

<i>We start communicating, and we fix things.</i>

Oh.

I made you a little something.

It's really insensitive.

Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

Oh, shit. I'm so so--

You little shit.

You scared me.

Your face. It's-- It's--

You scared me. That was good.

It isâ€¦ It's good. Funny.

-[Kate breathing heavily]
-[chuckles]

Hey, oh. It's okay.

[ragged breathing]

You're okay.

I'm here. You're okay.

more and more,</i>

<i>not just when he goes to bed.</i>

He doesn't have to wear them all the time.
They make him feel uncomfortable.

He feels badly for you.

But he also feels uncomfortable
having his family watched.

I don't give a shit about his comfort.
That's my family.

What you're feeling right now,
Cameron, is normal.

No, it is not.

Something is wrong.

For the last couple of days, I feel it.
Something is off.

At this stage,

whatever you're going through,
it's normal. He's fine.

Yeah.

[no audible dialogue]

What's up with you?

-[video game beeping]
-[Jack] Cory, it's time to eat, buddy.

Cory. Pause it.

Cory, come on.

What do you think?

-I like it. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm?

-Pecorino instead of Parmesan.
-So good.

-Mmm, yeah. [chuckles]
-[Jack] Mmm.

Come on, man. Now. Pause it.

Kind of sweeter?

Yeah. It's great.

-[beeping continues]
-[sighs]

-[Poppy] You okay, babe?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

-[Poppy] What's up?
-No. I'm good. I'm good.

-You need to stop!

-[Poppy laughing] <i>Good job!</i>

-[Poppy] <i>I love him.</i>
-[sighs]

Wow.

[door opens]

Do what you need to do.




Hey, hey. Just, umâ€¦

Just be careful.


Hey, Doc.

Doc.

Wake up.

[Cory sighs]


I just had a really bad nightmare,
and I just wanted to see you.

Hey, I have an idea.

that this is beer, okay?

My first was with my mom.
I was a lot older than you, though.

But it's okay. We won't tell anybody.

-Hmm? [chuckles]
-[Cory] Yeah.

And these guys were her favorite thing
to eat with beer.

Edamame with loads of salt.

Washed down with a nice, crisp brew.

-Yum.
-How do you eat it?

Hmm, see? Just grab the top one.
Start one at a time with the top one.

Hmm, pop it out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

-Tastes good.
-Mmm, good, right?

Better than they look.

Yeah, now try it with your beer.

Okay.

Hold up, hold on. Cheers.

-Long life for you.
-[Cory chuckles]

-To edamame.
-[chuckles]

-Ah.
-Mmm.

I'll just take one more.

Come here, man.

[breathing shakily]

[breathes shakily]

You okay, Dad?

Let me look at you, man.
Let me look at that face.

Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm okay.

Cory?

Yes?

I love you, man.

I love you too, Dad.


Be good, Doc.



[Poppy sighs]


-Mm-hmm?
-P.

I love you.

Poppy, wake up.

Hmm? [sniffs, sighs]

Bear, what's wrong?

What's wrong?

It's nothing. I just--

I just had a really bad dream.

I got angry at Cory.
Dreamt I lost everything.

Oh, baby.

Come here. Aw.

Aw. [Poppy hums]

God, you're shaking, sweetheart.
You're shaking.

[Cameron breathing shakily]
It felt so real.

Oh, sweetheart.

-We're here. Yeah?
-Yes.

We're doing better now. Yeah?

Mmm. Yeah, we're doing great.


If it's a boyâ€¦

we should name him Andre.

Mmm, yeah. I know.

[both chuckle]

Hmm.

[breathing heavily]

Poppy?

Yeah?

I drifted.

Cam, stop it. Come here.

I'm so sorry. I just--


Listen.

We're back, yeah?

And it's wonderful.

-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

-Come here.
-[sniffles]

[Poppy hums]


[breathes shakily]

Come on, get to sleep. [chuckles]

-[sighs]
-[Poppy speaks French]

Thank you.

Take care of 'em.

I will.

[footsteps approaching]

Ah. [chuckles]

[exhales sharply]

[inhales sharply, sighs]

As of this morning,
he's officially Cameron Turner.

He'll never know about any of this.

Good.

Good.

Thank you, Doc.

Thank you.

It's hard to be left behind.

The new client is about to arrive.

Come down to us
when you're done speaking with him.

Jack left you something.

-[Jack] <i>Babe?</i>
-<i>Mm-hmm?</i>


<i>I love you.</i>




-[Jack chuckles]
-<i>What are you doing? I'm chopping stuff.</i>



and tell me you love me.</i>

-[Poppy] <i>What are you doing?</i>
-[Jack] <i>Just-- Come on. For real.</i>

-[Poppy sighs]
-[Jack] <i>I need to hear it.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>I love you, Cameron Turner.</i>

<i>Always have. And always will.</i>

-[Poppy] <i>How was that?</i>
-[Jack] <i>That was good.</i>
