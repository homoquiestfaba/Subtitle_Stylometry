is holding for Shanghai.


AND GET ME MR. GROSSMAN
IN BERLIN RIGHT AFTER. THANKS.

(speaking Mandarin)

(Bluetooth chirps)

JEN? HEY.

SPOKE TO KARL.
I HAD HIM SWITCH US

TO THE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
FLIGHT.

FIVE DAYS IN THE BAHAMAS.
(siren wailing in distance)

YOU IN?

EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

(resumes speaking Mandarin)

(continues speaking Mandarin)

(cell phone chimes and beeps)

(speaking German)

THEY'RE GONNA GIVE HER

THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION.

BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER,

SHE'S GONNA DRINK
THE MARRIAGE AND BABY PUNCH,

AND YOU CAN'T HACK THAT GIG
AND A FAMILY

OVERSEAS 300 DAYS A YEAR.
NOT HAPPENING.

(pen cap clicks)
MS. GERARD!

THE PROJECTED NUMBERS SEPARATED
BY QUARTERLY COMPARISONS.

DOMESTIC PROFIT BY REGION.

YOU'RE A LIFE-SAVER, KARL.

HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE?

THEY'RE IN THE BOARDROOM NOW,
AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

OH, AND YOUR MOM CALLED...
AGAIN.

WONDERING IF YOU'RE COMING HOME
FOR THANKSGIVING.

SHE'S WORKING AT THE CAFE.
WE'LL CALL HER AT HOME.

YOU'LL GET VOICEMAIL.
IT'S DIALING.

DON'T JUDGE ME, KARL.

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO A GERARD FAMILY THANKSGIVING?

I DON'T THINK SO.
(voicemail beeps)

HEY, MOM, IT'S ME.

UH, YES, I AM COMING HOME.
SORRY I MISSED YOU.

I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OKAY, LOVE YOU. BYE.

(receiver clatters)

(telephone ringing in distance)

YOU ARE A TERRIBLE DAUGHTER.

LOVE YOU. MEAN IT.

WHAT THE SAVE NOW CUSTOMER
WANTS IN THEIR MEGA STORE

IS CONVENIENCE.

MARK TWAIN ONCE SAID, "LIFE HAS
ONE PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVE--

"TO MAKE YOU DO
PARTICULAR THINGS

YOU PARTICULARLY
DON'T WANT TO DO."


WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE
SHOP WITH US.

UPON COMPLETION,
THE STREETSVILLE MEGA STORE

WILL BE OUR MOST PROFITABLE,

WITH COMPANY PROFITS EXPECTED
TO EXCEED 8%

WITHIN THE FIRST QUARTER
THE FIRST YEAR.


WHAT ABOUT THEIR CITY COUNCIL?

OUR DEAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
APPROVED A MONTH AGO.

I'M FROM STREETSVILLE, DEAN.
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

A FEW STILL AREN'T SOLD
ON THE BENEFITS

OF A SAVE NOW MEGA STORE,

HOWEVER, THE MAYOR HAS SIGNED
A STIPULATION

AGREEING TO NEGOTIATE
IN GOOD FAITH.

I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT A RESOLUTION

WILL BE PASSED
AT TOMORROW'S HEARING,

AND I'M GOING THERE PERSONALLY
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES.

THERE'S A LOT RIDING
ON THIS ONE.

STREETSVILLE WILL BE
OUR 100th STORE.

INVESTORS WILL BE WATCHING
VERY CLOSELY.

WE'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED
A CEREMONIAL GROUNDBREAKING,

MASSIVE MEDIA BLITZ--

"SMALL TOWN GIVES THANKS
TO SAVE NOW ON THANKSGIVING."

WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT.

THERE SHE IS. "THE HAMMER."

YOU'RE MY ACE IN THE HOLE,
GERARD.

WE NEED THAT VOTE
TO GO OUR WAY.

THIS TOWN NEEDS
ONE OF THEIR OWN

TO SELL THEM ON THE IDEA,
AND THAT'S YOU.

GENIUS.

(staff members murmuring)

EVERYONE IN HERE
WOULD SELL THEIR OWN MOTHER

FOR THAT INTERNATIONAL JOB.

YOU PULL THIS OFF,
IT'S AS GOOD AS YOURS.

I KNOW.

(indistinct conversations)

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

OH! HEY.
HEY. (chuckles)

HEY, YOU KNOW THAT
ONE FRIEND EVERYONE HAS

WHO, EVEN ON YOUR CUTEST DAY,
ALWAYS SHOWS UP LOOKING HOTTER?

YEAH. WHY? IS SHE HERE?
YES.  <i> WELCOME.</i>

YOU'RE GIVING ME SOME
SERIOUS JLo IN THOSE PANTS.

OOH, WAIT.
"SELENA" OR "GIGLI"?

FLY GIRL.
OH.

HELLO, LADY.

MWAH.

TO US IN THE BAHAMAS IN A WEEK.

I DON'T LIKE THE COLD,

AND CRANBERRY SAUCE
FREAKS ME OUT.


MY MOM IS GOING TO CRY.
I KNOW IT.

YOU HAVEN'T TOLD
YOUR MOTHER YET?
I TOLD HER--NO.

KIND OF. I MEAN, I DIDN'T--
I TOLD HER I WAS COMING HOME.

I DIDN'T SAY THAT IT WAS,
YOU KNOW, FOR THANKSGIVING.

AS A SHRINK,
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

YOU'RE A TERRIBLE DAUGHTER.

MM?
YOU NEED SERIOUS HELP.

LOOK, I JUST DON'T BUY
THAT WOMEN CAN HAVE IT ALL.

I THINK THEY HAVE
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

I MADE MY CHOICE.
I CHOSE CAREER OVER MARRIAGE.

NOW YOU ARE LOOKING

AT A SUCCESSFUL, INDEPENDENT
WOMAN

WHO CHERISHES THE FREEDOM

TO SPEND TIME WITH WHOMEVER
SHE WANTS.

SPEAKING OF WHOMEVER
SHE WANTS...

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

WHO IS THAT PIECE
OF "YES"?

THAT'S DEREK.

HE OWNS THIS PLACE,
LIVES IN MY BUILDING.

WE'VE... HUNG OUT.

UH, WELL, DON'T LOOK NOW.
HERE COMES

YOUR RICH, TALL
BOOTY CALL.

SO... HOW GOES LIFE
AS A CORPORATE SHARK?

VICIOUS. HOW GOES LIFE
OF A FIVE STAR CHEF?

DELICIOUS.
LET'S LEAVE THEM ALONE.

LET'S GO OUT SOMETIME
FOR A CHANGE.

ANYTHING YOU WANT.
MOVIE. PARIS.

ICE SKATING? THE RINK
JUST OPENED FOR THE SEASON.

WE COULD GO DOWN.
NO, I DON'T DO ICE SKATING.

I PREFER MY FEET FIRMLY PLANTED
UNDERNEATH ME.

WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

I PREFER MY FEET FIRMLY PLANTED
UNDERNEATH YOU AS WELL.


TERRIBLE, YEAH.

WHOO!
I SAY WE TRY IT AGAIN.

UH-HUH. VERY FUNNY.

AND THEN I SHALL MAKE YOU
SOME BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING.

(cell phone vibrating)
NO. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

AAH! AND I DON'T DO SLEEPOVERS,
AND I DON'T DO BREAKFAST.

OH, COME ON.

EVERYBODY EATS.
THAT'S WHAT CELERY IS FOR
IN THE BLOODY MARY.

YOU DON'T DO ICE SKATING.
YOU DON'T DO BREAKFAST.

WHAT  <i> DO  </i> YOU DO?

HELLO? (whispers) GO.

(normal voice) UH, YEAH.
I'M HERE.

OKAY, GOT IT. I NEED TO BE
IN STREETSVILLE BY 1:00.

â™ª LIFE HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS â™ª

â™ª SOME LOST AND NEVER FOUND â™ª

â™ª TURMOIL ON COMMON GROUNDS â™ª

â™ª WE LEARN TO TAKE IT
AS IT COMES â™ª

â™ª SO MUCH FOR SITTING STILL â™ª

â™ª WE BEND IT TO OUR WILL â™ª

â™ª AND OUT HERE â™ª

â™ª THEY PORTRAY
OUR PERFECT PLACE â™ª

â™ª AROUND HERE â™ª

â™ª AROUND HERE â™ª

â™ª AROUND HERE â™ª

â™ª YOU KNOW THESE STREETS,
THESE SMILING FACES â™ª

AND HERE WE ARE.

â™ª AROUND HERE â™ª


NICE. VERY SUBTLE. HELLO?

OH! THERE'S MY GIRL!

HI.

SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

OH! THAT'S A TIGHT ONE.

JEEZ, LOUISE. WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU ATE?

I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A HAM SANDWICH.

ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT DOING MEAT.

WELL, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO  <i> DO  </i> IT.

IT'S CHILLY.
HOW ABOUT SOME TEA, THEN?

WHAT'S IN VOGUE
IN THE BIG CITY NOW?

CHAI? POMEGRANATE?

WE'VE GOT
A NICE, NEW GREEN GINGER.

YOU WANNA TRY THAT?

YEAH, SURE.

YOU KNOW, MOM,
ONCE THE NEW SAVE NOW OPENS,

YOU'LL HAVE OVER 50 KINDS OF TEA
TO CHOOSE FROM.

WHAT ON EARTH WOULD I NEED
50 KINDS OF TEA FOR?

I DON'T KNOW. OPTIONS, MAYBE.

(water running)
NO.

IF WE DON'T BUY OUR TEA
FROM THE CHANG FAMILY,

HOW WILL I KNOW IF THEIR SON
PASSED THE BAR

OR THAT LYNN'S MOTHER PERFECTED
HER ALMOND COOKIE RECIPE?

(under breath)
IT'S CALLED TWITTER.

(indistinct conversations)
GREAT. THANKS.

SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?

THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING
LATER?

IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS,
YES.

ARE YOU HERE ALONE,

OR DID YOU BRING SOME
OF THOSE LAWYERS WITH YOU?

BECAUSE I CAN SET EXTRA PLACES
AT THANKSGIVING IF YOU WANT.

THAT'S FUNNY, MOM.

WELL, I'LL TAKE MY DAUGHTER
ANY WAY I CAN GET HER.

YOU ARE STAYING FOR
THANKSGIVING, THOUGH, RIGHT?


COULD THAT THING BE
ANY MORE...
(door closes)

CARTER.

HEY.


YOU LOOK...
(claps hands)

YOU, TOO. YEAH.

HOW'S CHICAGO?

CRAZY.

BUSY. CRAZY BUSY.

I FORGOT SOMETHING BACK
AT THE JOB SITE. I...

OKAY.

GOOD TO SEE YOU, THOUGH.

YOU, TOO.


YOU KNOW, THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
WITH HIM AND... TRISHA.
(door closes)

OH. WOW. THAT'S A SHAME.

AND HE TURNED ALL
HIS WOODWORKING

INTO A CUSTOM CABINETRY
BUSINESS.

IT'S BACK-ORDERED
FOR OVER A YEAR.

YAY FOR CARTER.
(clears throat)

(door closes)
HEY, WE'RE HERE!

OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK HOW OLD YOU GOT.

AND SO DID YOU, JAKE.

OH, THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU,
MOUTH BREATHER.
MM-HMM.

OH! WELL, JUST THINK,
NOW THAT YOU'RE FINALLY HERE,

MOM CAN SHUT UP
ABOUT HOW YOU NEVER VISIT.

OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

MAYBE I'LL JUST ABANDON
EVERYTHING

I'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR

AND MOVE RIGHT ON BACK
TO GOOD OLD STREETSVILLE.

HOORAY! THEN BY THIS TIME
NEXT YEAR,

YOU CAN BE A SINGLE,
DIVORCED MOTHER JUST LIKE ME.

MM, EXCELLENT.
IT'S SETTLED.

I HAVE AN IDEA I WANNA GET
TO MY BUSINESS-SAVVY DAUGHTERS.

OH.
THIS IS FOR ME
AND MY CONTEMPORARIES

WHO ARE GOING
THROUGH THE CHANGE.

OKAY. INSTEAD OF HOT YOGA,

YOU HAVE THE A.C. CRANKED UP
TO 50,

AND YOU HAVE FANS BLOWING
LIKE A STORM.

I'M CALLING IT "FROZEN YOGA."

'CAUSE THOSE ZUMBA PEOPLE
HAVE MADE A FORTUNE,

AND I THINK IT'S A LOCK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

IT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?
ISN'T IT GOOD?
YES. MM.

YES, MEL, PLEASE DO TELL US
WHAT YOU THINK.

UH... ACTUALLY,
IT'S... INTERESTING.

THERE'S DEFINITELY
A MARKET FOR IT.

I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS,
THOUGH.

HOW DO YOU...
BURN ANY CALORIES?

THE WHOLE POINT OF BIKRAM
IS TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS,

TO EXPEDITE.

EXCUSE ME. THE WHOLE POINT
OF YOGA IS TO SLOW DOWN

AND STRETCH AND BREATHE.

YEAH, IF YOU HAVE TIME TO
SLOW DOWN, STRETCH, AND BREATHE.

GIVE ME THAT THING.
MOM.

IS THERE AN APP FOR STOPPING
TO SMELL THE ROSES?

THAT'S WHAT I WANNA KNOW.

MM, YES. AND MOM TELLS ME THAT
YOU'RE STAYING FOR THANKSGIVING.

I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO THE BAHAMAS

WITH YOUR FRIEN--

THE BAHAMAS?

I-I ASSUMED THAT YOU WERE
STAYING HERE WITH US.

THE DATES WHEN I BOOKED IT,

AND NOW, UH, YOU KNOW,
THE TICKETS ARE PAID FOR.

SO...
WELL, I GET IT.

I MEAN, THAT--THAT'LL BE FUN
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.

I JUST WISH
IT WASN'T THANKSGIVING.

BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA JUST
BE DOING THE SAME OLD STUFF

WE DO EVERY YEAR ANYWAY, SO...

IT'LL BE FUN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

I KNEW
SHE WAS GONNA CRY.

YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST TOLD HER
YOU WERE GOING WITH A BOYFRIEND.

SHE WOULD'VE... DRIVEN YOU
TO THE AIRPORT HERSELF.

MM. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T
WANT  <i> CARTER  </i> TO KNOW.

I DID HEAR
THAT HE STOPPED BY.

OH, REALLY?
MM-HMM.

GOOD OLD CARTER.
STILL SINGLE.

OW.

(indistinct conversations)

(gavel bangs)

WE'D LIKE TO MOTION FOR A VOTE.

SAVE NOW HAS MADE
A NEW GENEROUS OFFER

FOR THE PROPOSED SITE,

AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT--

MAYOR GORDON,
WE HAVEN'T AGREED ON

ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT
MOST OF US DON'T WANT

THAT STORE
IN OUR BACKYARD.

(crowd cheers and murmurs)

LET'S LET MEL SPEAK.

(conversations fade)


THAT THIS IS NOT JUST
AN ECONOMIC ISSUE.

IT'S EMOTIONAL.

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS.

IT'S ABOUT IDENTITY.

THIS IS MY HOME, TOO.

I LOVE STREETSVILLE,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

IT'S THE VERY DEFINITION
OF HOMEGROWN--

THE SHOPS, THE FOOD...

THE WAY OF LIFE.

IT'S REALLY SOMETHING
TO BE PROUD OF.

BUT BUILDING
A SAVE NOW MEGA STORE

IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

OUR PHILOSOPHY IS TO EMBRACE
THE IDENTITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

THEN WHY DID BOTH
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES

REJECT YOUR PROPOSAL?

(crowd clamors)
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

BECAUSE A NEW SAVE NOW
IS GONNA BRING IN

<i>THOUSANDS  </i> OF PEOPLE
FROM SURROUNDING TOWNS.

(crowd clamors)
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

THE STATE IS GONNA APPROVE
A HIGHWAY COMING THROUGH HERE,

AND THEN
OUR TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY

IS GONNA BECOME JUST
ANOTHER ANONYMOUS SUBURB.

THESE BULK STORES--
THEY SELL EVERYTHING.

THEY'RE GONNA UNDERCUT
LOCAL PRICES,

AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

ONE BY ONE, ALL OF OUR
MOM AND POP SHOPS THAT WE LOVE--

THEY WILL GO UNDER.

EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN
A CHOICE IN THEIR FUTURE.

DON'T YOU AGREE, CARTER?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW, MELODY,
NOT IF THAT CHOICE

ISN'T MUTUAL AMONG
BOTH PARTIES.

I THINK WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO
IS WHETHER A TOWN

WANTS TO REMAIN MIRED
IN ANONYMITY

OR BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GROW.

AND I THINK GROWTH
IS STRONGEST

WHERE ONE'S ROOTS
ARE DEEPEST.

NOT UNLESS
THEY'VE BEEN NURTURED.

MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WANNA BE.

CAN WE GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS
AT HAND? I MOTION FOR A VOTE.

(crowd groaning)

WE DON'T NEED A VOTE.

I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT THIS OFF...

(crowd speaking at once)

A MOTION HAS JUST BEEN MADE

TO DELAY THE VOTE
UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND

SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE
A CHANCE TO READ

SAVE NOW'S LATEST PROPOSAL.

I SECOND THE MOTION. DONE.

(gavel bangs)

(indistinct conversations)

MMM. COFFEE SMELLS GOOD.

HEY, MOM.

HEY, HONEY. I'M DOING SOME YOGA.
YOU WANNA DO IT WITH ME?

UH--
(doorbell rings)

(door opens)


(door closes)

WOW. ELAINE, LOOK AT YOU.
NICE JOB.

MUST HAVE BEEN NICE TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL...
WHEN SHE WASN'T ON THE PHONE.

YOU GOT A SEC?

UH, ACTUALLY, NO.
I'M GETTING ON A CONFERENCE CALL

IN 34 MINUTES
WITH GERMANY.

PERFECT.
I'LL HAVE YOU BACK IN 33.

WAIT. WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BYE!

PUT ME DOWN!
BYE!

AAH! UHH!

COME ON. YOU COULDN'T AT LEAST
GET MY COAT?

IT'S COLD OUT HERE. THIS IS
AN... (muffled) ABDUCTION.

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

YOU'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.


SO, UH...

WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU
AND OL' TRISHA?

CAUGHT HER IN BED
WITH SOMEONE.

WOW. THAT'S ROUGH.
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

YES, I DID...

KNOW  <i> HER.</i>

(stifles laugh)

MM. SORRY. THAT'S...

MM.

(brakes squeal)

(gears shift, engine turns off)

OKAY, HERE WE ARE AT THE CORNER
OF MEMORY LANE

AND WHAT IS THE POINT?

THE POINT IS I BOUGHT IT...
AGAIN.

(door squeaks)

YOU LIVE HERE?
I'M CONFUSED.

I THOUGHT WE SOLD IT
WHEN I...

TOOK THAT JOB
AND LEFT ME?

YEAH.

NEW OWNERS SAT ON IT.
I KEPT TABS ON IT,

WHICH AGGRAVATED
THE HELL OUT OF TRISHA,

BUT IT AGGRAVATED HER
EVEN MORE

WHEN I SOLD MY PLACE
TO BUY IT BACK AFTER WE SPLIT.

SOUNDS LIKE
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.

SPENT THE LAST YEAR OR SO
GUTTING IT

AND DOING ALL THIS,

AND PENDING THE APPROVAL
OF PERMITS,

WE OPEN EARLY NEXT YEAR.

WATCH YOUR HEAD 'CAUSE I'M
HANGING SOME STUFF

FROM THE CEILING,

AND THE RUNNER
IS NOT FIXED YET, MELODY.

(step creaks)

OKAY, PLEASE DON'T CALL ME
"MELODY."

I'M IMPRESSED.

YOU DID ALL THIS YOURSELF?

WHAT? STRIP AWAY
ALL THE OLD,

REBUILD THE FOUNDATION
ON MY OWN,

REFINISH EVERYTHING MYSELF?

YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY, ARE YOU?

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA CALL IT,
THE BITTER B&B? (chuckles)

I SEE YOU IN THERE, MEL.

I-I SEE YOU UNDER ALL THIS,
UNDER--UNDER THE...

TAILORED SUIT AND ALL THAT
MAKEUP YOU PUT ON...

LIKE YOU'RE NOT WEARING ANY.

F.Y.I.--I'M HAPPY. THIS IS
WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE. SEE?

SERIOUSLY? HALF-STARVED?
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY?


DO YOU THINK
I LOOK SKINNY?

HA! I THINK YOU ARE RUNNING
FROM WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW

TO WHAT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
END UP AT A PLACE

THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.
AT LEAST I'M TRYING.

ON THE WAY HERE,
I PASSED BY THE CEMETERY.

THAT IS FARTHER THAN MOST
LOCALS GET FROM STREETSVILLE.

HAS IT EVER
EVEN OCCURRED TO YOU

THAT STREETSVILLE
ISN'T WHERE THEY ENDED UP

BUT WHERE
THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE?

(cell phone vibrates)
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

YOU ARE STILL YOU,
AND I AM ME,

AND WE ARE RIGHT HERE
IN THIS PLACE

THAT WE USED TO BE US.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

WHAT? IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
IT WAS LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

WE WERE YOUNG. I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS BAD TIMING.

CONGRATULATIONS
ON A JOB WELL DONE,

BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW.

AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HERE,
YOUR LAWYERS ARE, UH,

THEY'RE PRESSURING ME TO--
WELL, NO, THREATENING ME TO SELL

JUST SO THEY CAN
TEAR IT DOWN.

I... I REALLY HAD
NO IDEA.

OUR BED & BREAKFAST
IS RIGHT WHERE

THE PARKING LOT
IS GOING TO BE.

OKAY. IT'S NOT OURS.
IT'S YOURS.

AND I'M SURE YOU WERE OFFERED
FAIR MARKET VALUE.

AND I'M NOT SURE
YOU EVEN KNOW

THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "VALUE," MEL.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LOOK THAT UP.

THANKS FOR THE TOUR.
I'LL WALK BACK.

I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
OH, REALLY?

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

MELODY, DON'T--DON'T--
OKAY, DON'T CALL ME "MELODY."

FINE.
JUST PLEASE, REMEMBER--

I REMEMBER EVERYTHING!

THE RUNNER'S LOOSE!

MEL?!

(groaning softly)

OH, MELODY.

OH. SWEETHEART.

OH, THANK GOD. YOU HAD US
SCARED TO DEATH.

HEY. (whispers) HI.

HOW YOU FEELING?

WHOA. WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT, A MAN CAN'T KISS
HIS OWN WIFE, MEL?

WIFE? WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

WHERE DO YOU LIVE, MELODY?

MEL. 6001 LAKE STREET.
CHICAGO.

CHICAGO?

AND WHERE DO YOU WORK?

I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF OPERATIONS AT SAVE NOW.

YOUR FULL NAME?
MEL.

MELODY GERARD.

UH...

MELODY  <i> McCLURE.</i>

AND WE LIVE ON  <i> ELM STREET,</i>
RIGHT HERE IN STREETSVILLE.

WHAT?

OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING,

BUT I AM NOT BUYING IT.
SWEETIE, YOU GOT HIT
ON THE HEAD,

OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT HARDER
THAN WE THOUGHT,

SO YOU NEED TO TAKE IT EASY.

YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE?

NO, I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
I'M JUST NOT MARRIED,

AND I DON'T LIVE
IN STREETSVILLE, FOR GOD SAKE.

MRS. McCLURE, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
SUFFERING SOME KIND OF DELUSION

BROUGHT ON BY THE HEAD TRAUMA.
YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN

AND LET ME EXAMINE YOU
FURTHER.

WHAT I NEED TO DO
IS GET OUT OF HERE.

THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO.
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GUYS

DON'T WANT THE STORE,
BUT THIS IS SICK.

MELODY, YOU--YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK YOU'RE NOT MARRIED

AND YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO
AND YOU WORK FOR SAVE NOW?
WHAT I THINK IS THAT

YOU ALL HAVE TOO MUCH TIME
ON YOUR HANDS, OKAY?
MELODY, BACK IN BED.

I HAVE TO PEE.
DOES MARRIED MELODY STILL PEE?



(exhales deeply) OKAY, OKAY.
(turns on faucet)

(water running)

(slaps palms)

BAD DREAM, BAD DREAM.
(breathes heavily) OW.

NO. IT'S REAL. OKAY.

IT'S A JOKE. IT'S A JOKE.

OH, THEY'RE CRAZY.
THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.

YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

(knock on door)

JUST A MINUTE.

DOCTOR, WHAT IS GOING ON?

PHYSICALLY, SHE'S FINE.

UH, THE X-RAY SHOWS
NO HEMORRHAGING.

ONLY A SLIGHT CONTUSION
WITH A RESULTING CONCUSSION.


MY GUESS IS THAT
SHE'S SUFFERING

FROM SOMETHING CALLED
LACUNAR AMNESIA.

IT LEAVES A GAP
IN THE RECORDED MEMORY.

SHE'S OBVIOUSLY FILLED IT IN
WITH A FANTASY,

A WISH FULFILLMENT.

YOU MEAN... SHE WISHES THAT--
THAT SHE NEVER...

SHE'LL NEED TO SEE
A SPECIALIST,

BUT MY UNDERSTANDING
IS THAT THE GAP

USUALLY CLOSES IN DUE TIME.

SOMETIMES IT ONLY TAKES,
YOU KNOW, ONE SMALL THING

FOR IT ALL TO FALL BACK
INTO PLACE, UH, SO TO SPEAK.

MEL? YOU OKAY?

(door creaks)

(Panic Attack's
"We Cry Diamonds" playing)

â™ª IT'S OKAY, I'M FINE â™ª


â™ª YOU GOT ME STUCK RIGHT HERE,
AND I WANNA MOVE ON â™ª

â™ª BLOOD ON MY SHIRT â™ª

â™ª YOU TRIED TO KEEP IT CLEAN,
BUT I'M EASILY HURT â™ª

â™ª I GET SO NERVOUS â™ª

â™ª TELL ME, DO I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES? â™ª

OH, THANKS, MOM.

MEL'S GONE.
<i>WHAT?</i>

â™ª TELL THE TRUTH,
I EASILY BREAK â™ª

â™ª ALREADY FORGOT
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY â™ª

â™ª THIS HAS GOTTA BE
THE WORST DAY EVER â™ª

â™ª WANNA GET CLOSE,
KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY â™ª

UH... MOM! IT LOOKS LIKE--
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE TOOK YOUR CAR.

WELL...
MAYBE SHE WENT HOME?

YEAH, EXCEPT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE HOME IS.

WHAT WAS THAT ADDRESS
IN CHICAGO?

â™ª SHE'S ALL BROKE UP â™ª

UH, UM... 6001 LAKE STREET,
I THINK.

6001 LAKE STREET.

â™ª ALWAYS IMAGINE THE WORST â™ª

â™ª NEVER BEEN MUCH
FOR SURPRISES â™ª

â™ª PANIC JUST A LITTLE
AT FIRST â™ª

â™ª ALREADY FORGOT
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY â™ª

DID YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT?
LOOKS GREAT.

â™ª WANNA GET CLOSE,
KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY â™ª

UH, IT'S FINE. MM-HMM.
KARL...

SOMEBODY'S LATE.

YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT THEY ARE DOING

TO INTIMIDATE ME.
MY WHOLE FAMILY IS IN ON IT.

I HAVE A TON OF FILING,

BUT RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU
ON THE PHONE.

PHONE? WHAT? LOOK...

I GOTTA TALK TO HIM.

THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH
THE CITY COUNCIL VOTE.

IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

EMPLOYMENT SOLUTIONS
SENT  <i> YOU?</i>

OH, I KNOW.
SO UGLY, RIGHT?

UH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

I HAVE MORE CLOTHES
IN MY OFFICE.
WHOA!

LOOK, LADY--

OKAY, WHOA, KARL.
"LADY"? I'M YOUR BOSS.

OH, REALLY?
HEY!

IS THIS HOW IT'S GONNA GO?
LOOK. SQUIRREL.

SECURITY! (gasps)

KARL? I KNEW YOU WERE
GUNNING FOR MY JOB,

BUT THIS IS A TAD SOON,
DON'T YOU THINK?

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE
CALL SECURITY?

â™ª THE WORST DAY EVER â™ª

â™ª NOW I'M ONE STEP CLOSER â™ª
THERE, THERE!


OKAY. LOOK, GUYS...
OH, CRAP.

I-I'M GONNA CALL
HUMAN RESOURCES!

â™ª DO I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES? â™ª

â™ª NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A FIGHTER â™ª

LOOK OUT, GIRLS.
â™ª I EASILY BREAK â™ª

â™ª ALREADY FORGOT
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY â™ª

NO! GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
(shouts indistinctly)

â™ª WANNA GET CLOSE,
KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY â™ª

â™ª THIS IS GONNA BE
THE WORST DAY, DAY, DAY â™ª

â™ª FRAGILE, DON'T BREAK â™ª

â™ª SHE LETS IT ALL HANG OUT
SO IT'S EASY TO TAKE â™ª

â™ª GIRL'S MADE OF GLASS â™ª

â™ª WHEN SHE'S ALL BROKE UP,
SHE'S A PAIN IN THE... AHH â™ª

OH! DEREK! JEN.

THANK GOD. HI, GUYS.
OH! THIS IS SO GREAT.

THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
TO YOU.

THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT YOU.

I'M SORRY. I DON'T THINK
THAT WE'VE, UM--

SEE, I WENT HOME
TO STREETSVILLE,

AND I HIT MY HEAD, AND THEN
EVERYBODY STARTED PRETENDING

LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE SOME
ELABORATE PLAN

SO I DON'T BUILD
A SAVE NOW MEGA STORE.

I DON'T KNOW.
WHO ARE YOU?

YEAH. WHO IS SHE, DEREK?

YOUR FRIEND!

YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHO
ALWAYS LOOKS HOTTER THAN YOU,

NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

LOOK, I AM SORRY.

I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU STAY
AND MAKE ME BREAKFAST.

I'M SURE IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING

SO YUMMY LIKE FRITTATAS
OR FANCY SCONES. I DON'T KNOW.

NEXT TIME, I WILL, OKAY?

JEN--

OH! WOW. SOMEONE'S CRANKY.


YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST WAITED
A COUPLE WEEKS

BEFORE YOU MADE YOUR MOVE.
WHAT ABOUT GIRL CODE?


(vehicles passing)


MEL!

(horns honking in distance)
MEL?

ARE YOU OKAY?

CAN'T RUN OFF LIKE THAT, OKAY?

YOU HIT YOUR HEAD.

OH. WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED
TO JUST BELIEVE

THAT EVERYTHING I REMEMBER--
MY WHOLE LIFE--

IS JUST A DELUSION
BROUGHT ON BY A HEAD TRAUMA?

NO, NOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

JUST... (sighs)

JUST THIS PART, I GUESS.

THE DOCTOR SAID YOUR MEMORIES
ARE GONNA COME BACK.

JUST ONE LITTLE THING
CAN TRIGGER THE REST.

LET ME TAKE YOU HOME.
COME ON.

I CAN DO IT ON MY OWN.

OKAY.

WHAT? WHAT? DID YOU JUST...
SEE SOMETHING?

YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING?

NO, I JUST KEEP THINKING
THAT I'M GETTING PUNK'D.

OKAY, HERE. TAKE THIS.
TAKE THIS, OKAY?

(brakes squeal)

(car door opens)

(car doors close)

OH, GOD. DON'T TELL ME
I HAVE KIDS.

NOT YET,
BUT WE HAVE FUN TRYING.

GROSS.

WE JUST GOT HOME,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

I THINK SHE JUST NEEDS
SOME TIME TO SORT THINGS OUT.

WE'LL COME BY LATER, OKAY?
BYE.

(cell phone beeps)

THAT'S, UH,
FOR THE GRAND OPENING.

WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED
RENOVATING.

THIS IS WHERE I HIT MY HEAD.

YEAH, THIS IS WHERE
YOU SLIPPED AND FELL. EXACTLY.

WHAT--WHAT ELSE
DO YOU REMEMBER?

WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT US?

I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO START?

WE DATED
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

GOT ENGAGED RIGHT OUT
OF COLLEGE.

BOUGHT THE INN. I GOT
THE JOB OFFER IN CHICAGO.

YOU DIDN'T WANNA GO.
I TOOK THE JOB,

SO WE BROKE OFF
THE ENGAGEMENT,

AND... SOLD THE INN.

OKAY.

BUT THEN YOU CAME BACK,
AND WE GOT MARRIED,

AND THEN WE BOUGHT
THIS PLACE BACK

WHEN THE OWNERS PUT IT UP
FOR SALE A YEAR AGO

TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.
NO.

I DIDN'T COME BACK.

UH, YES, YOU DID.

YOU REMEMBER?
IT WAS, UH,

IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
YOUR DAD DIED,

AND--AND YOU STAYED.

NO, I DIDN'T. I LEFT
RIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL.

I HAD TO GO OVERSEAS
FOR WORK.

MY MOM TOLD ME
NOT TO FEEL GUILTY

AND THAT SHE WAS FINE.
I DIDN'T STAY.

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
YOU KNOW HOW UPSET YOUR MOM WAS.

I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF DAUGHTER
WOULD LEAVE HER MOTHER

RIGHT AFTER SHE LOSES
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE?

A TERRIBLE ONE.

SO OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME,

BUT YOU--
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

YOU WILL. HEY.
YOU'RE MY SWEET MELODY.

YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

OKAY, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

PLEASE DON'T CALL ME THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

YOU LOVE IT
WHEN I CALL YOU THAT.

OKAY, NOW I KNOW
I'M HALLUCINATING.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

OH, THANKS.

OKAY.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

(footsteps approach)

MEL, YOU SHOULD BE RESTING.

YEAH, I AM.

IS ANYTHING COMING BACK?

I DIDN'T LOSE MY HEARING,
MOM.

SWEETHEART, TRY SOME
OF THAT GINKGO BILOBA TEA.

IT'S GOOD FOR MEMORY LOSS.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

HEY, MEL. WE ARE
ALL FINISHED HERE.

HEY, YOU.

GOOD JOB.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT.
OKAY. I'LL... HELP OUT.

SURE.
(dishes clink)

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

CAN I GET A REFILL,
MEL-A-DOODLE?

FOOD DRIVE'S ALREADY
MATCHED LAST YEAR'S, MEL.

PATTY THINKS YOU'RE A SAINT.
SO DO I.

THANKS FOR GETTING GORDON
TO LIFT THE ALCOHOL BAN

AT THE SKATING RINK.

YOU BETCHA.

OWNER'S DAY OFF, RUSS.

WAIT. I OWN THIS PLACE?
MM-HMM.

UH, YES, YOU DO.
IN FACT...

A CHAIN OF SWEET MELODY'S?

AWESOME, RIGHT?
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT INTEREST

FROM LIMITED PARTNERS.

THE FIRST ONE
IS PLANNED IN CHICAGO.

COME HERE, HONEY.
HERE'S YOUR TEA, SWEETIE.

OH, THANKS, MOM.

SO...

"LIFE IS PLANNED
WITH ONE PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVE

"TO MAKE YOU DO
ALL THE PARTICULAR THINGS

YOU PARTICULARLY
DON'T WANT TO DO."

WAS THIS ALWAYS HERE?
ALWAYS.

WHY? IS IT TRIGGERING
SOMETHING?

(speaking Mandarin)

(continues speaking Mandarin)

I'M SORRY.

I CAN'T--
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

(speaking Mandarin)

<i>XIÃ¨XIE. XIÃ¨XIE.</i>

(speaks Mandarin)

(door creaks)


HMM.

(flips page)

(door creaks)

(cup clatters)
IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?

OVULATION CHART.
YEAH, YOU MADE IT.

WE WERE TRYING TO...
YOU KNOW.

UGH. OKAY.
(laughs nervously)

I DRIVE A STATION WAGON,
AND I MADE AN OVULATION CHART.

I LITERALLY HATE MYSELF.

HEY, UH... SO, SHOULD I
SLEEP ON THE COUCH, OR...

MAYBE THAT IS A...

BEST. UM, WELL,
YOU KNOW...

OBVIOUSLY, IT'S YOUR ROOM,
SO... IT'S UP TO YOU.

I COULDN'T FIND MY PAJAMAS,
SO I BORROWED A SHIRT.

UM, NO, ACTUALLY.
THAT'S YOURS.

OH.

LOVELY.

(jeans thud)
UH, OKAY.

(clears throat)

UM... HEY,
WHAT ARE THE ODDS

THAT YOU REMEMBER
I SLEEP NAKED?

OR THAT THIS--
THIS IS THE KEY DETAIL

TO JOG YOUR MEMORY AND SENDING
ALL THE REST FLOATING BACK?

NOPE, PRETTY MUCH LOOKS THE SAME
SINCE THE FIRST TIME

I SAW IT IN HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT THANKS FOR TRYING. (laughs)

YEAH. WELL, THE DOCTOR DID SAY
"ANY LITTLE THING,"

SO... YOU KNOW.

REALLY?
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

YEAH.
HMM.

NO!
THAT'S RIGHT.

I AM GONNA TICKLE YOU BECAUSE
I KNOW YOU PEE YOUR PANTS

WHENEVER YOU LAUGH
TOO HARD.

I'M NOT GONNA STOP.
I'M NOT GONNA STOP.


HMM.

YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, HUH?

YES, I DO.

I KNOW--I KNOW EVERYTHING.

I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE MAYONNAISE
ON YOUR FRENCH FRIES.

I KNOW YOU LOVE
THE SMELL OF RAIN ON CONCRETE.

I KNOW YOU HATE
TECHNO MUSIC. I...

(inhales deeply) I KNOW
THAT YOU LOST YOUR LUNCH

ON THE DOUBLE DRAGON
AT FUN WORLD...

BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I FELT LIKE

SOMEBODY KNEW ME.

FOR YEARS I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE IF I HADN'T LEFT.

IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THIS,

ONLY NOW I'M HERE
AND I DON'T KNOW IF...


(switch clicks)

DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU ON OUR FIRST DATE?

SOMETHING LIKE...

"JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WE ARE NOT HAVING SEX."

EXACTLY. STILL APPLIES.

EXCEPT IT WAS MORE...

"LIKE, JUST SO YOU  <i> KNOW,</i>
WE ARE  <i> SO  </i> NOT HAVING SEX."

I HATE YOU.

(floorboard creaks)

(hangers clacking)

(floorboard creaks)

UGH.

OH!

WELL PLAYED, KARMA.

MEL? WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

UH, NOTHING.
JUST GOING FOR A WALK.

C-COME ON BACK INSIDE, OKAY?

'CAUSE IT'S--IT'S--IT'S, UH...
COLD OUT.

I CAN'T DO IT.

I-I TRIED. I TRIED
REALLY HARD LAST NIGHT,

BUT THIS ISN'T ME.
THIS--THIS ISN'T MY LIFE.

UH... I AM--I'M VICE PRESIDENT
OF A GLOBAL CORPORATION.

I'M GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.
I HAVE A SUITE ON THE BEACH!

YOU WANNA--YOU WANNA
GO TO THE BAHAMAS?!

I'LL TAKE YOU, OKAY?

YOU--YOU WANNA MOVE BACK
TO THE CITY? FINE!

I'LL--I'LL MOVE BACK. JUST DON'T
LEAVE ME AGAIN, OKAY?

THE YEAR AFTER YOU LEFT ME,
IT WAS...

IT WAS THE WORST YEAR
OF MY LIFE.

WHAT?

IT WAS?

THAT MAKES ME SO...
INCREDIBLY HAPPY.

THE FOOD... IN THE FRIDGE THAT--
THAT WAS HALF-EATEN BY YOU,

I-I STOPPED EATING IT SO I
WOULDN'T HAVE TO THROW IT OUT.

THAT IS SO SWEET AND...
KINDA GROSS AT THE SAME TIME.

I PUT YOUR PILLOW
IN A PLASTIC BAG

SO I DIDN'T LOSE YOUR SMELL.

OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE
STALKER-Y, BUT GO AHEAD.

I LEFT THE SHOPPING LIST
UP ON THE BLACKBOARD

SO I DIDN'T ERASE
YOUR HANDWRITING.

I KEPT BUYING BANANAS
AND TOILET PAPER

AND--AND--AND PAPER TOWEL
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

OH, THIS IS
SO SADISTICALLY SATISFYING.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

FOR YEARS, I HAVE WONDERED

IF YOU WERE TORTURED
WHEN I LEFT,

AND NOW I GET TO HEAR
FIRSTHAND!

JUST COME BACK IN THE HOUSE.
PLEASE? COME ON.

IT'S FREEZING. COME ON.
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
AFTER ME?

WHAT?

YOU TOLD ME.

NO, I WAITED... AND WAITED,
AND YOU NEVER CAME.

AND EVENTUALLY,
THE FEELINGS

OF--OF SUCCESS FILLED UP
THE FEELINGS OF LONELINESS,

AND THEN ALL THE MEN--
THEY COVERED UP

MEMORIES OF YOU, AND THEN,
THE--THE--THE--THE HIGHS

OF MY CAREER LEVELED OUT
THE LOWS

OF YOU NEVER COMING BACK
FOR ME.

YOU TOLD ME THAT
IF YOU LOVED SOMETHING,

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET IT FREE
AND SEE IF IT COMES BACK!

THAT IS THE STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

WHAT AM I,
A FREAKIN' BOOMERANG?

HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN
ONE ROMANTIC COMEDY?

YOU ARE THE GUY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CHASE AFTER THE GIRL YOU LOVE

AND STOP HER FROM GETTING
ON THE AIRPLANE.

YOU TOOK MY CAR!
IT'S A METAPHOR!

IT WAS 14 YEARS AGO!

YEAH, I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MELODY?
HOME. AGAIN!

NO, NO! THERE'S NOWHERE
TO GO, MELODY!

HEY, CAN YOU STOP
CALLING ME "MELODY"?

(car door closes,
engine starts)

(birds twittering)


(horn blaring)

(blaring continues)


WHY DO YOU HATE ME?


(horn continues blaring)

MEL? WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, HONEY?

OH, SWEETIE. COME ON IN.
ANGELA'S HERE, TOO.

I BARELY MADE IT PAST
THE CEMETERY.

DEAD PEOPLE GOT FURTHER
OUT OF THIS TOWN THAN I DID.

HONEY, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE SITTING THERE,

WHY DON'T YOU MASH
SOMETHING?

TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING,

AND IT'S NOT GONNA STOP
FOR A CONCUSSION.

HOW COULD TOMORROW BE
THANKSGIVING ALREADY?

UGH.

AM I SUCH A MALCONTENT
THAT...

I MADE UP A WHOLE NEW LIFE
SO DIFFERENT

FROM THE ONE
I ALREADY HAD?

HARDLY. YOU'RE THE COUPLE
EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE.

HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS,
STILL IN LOVE.

REALLY?

MEL, WE'VE HAD
THESE DISCUSSIONS.

I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU WONDER
WHAT IT WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

IF YOU'D NEVER LEFT CHICAGO.
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T?

BIG-TIME EXECUTIVE,
LIVING IN A HIGH-RISE,

SPENDING YOUR MONEY
ON WHATEVER YOU WANT

WITH... WHOEVER YOU WANT.

SORRY.

LOOK, I...
GOT A BAD ONE.

YOU SAW ME THROUGH THAT.
BUT CARTER...

(clicks teeth)
CARTER'S ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

IT'S A GOOD TIME OF YEAR,
HONEY,

TO BE COUNTING
ONE'S BLESSINGS. MM.

AND FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING,

YOU HAVE A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.


â™ª WHY MY HEART â™ª

â™ª FEELS THIS WAY â™ª

(curtain rings swoosh)
MM.

â™ª WHEN I'M WITH YOU â™ª

OH.

RISE AND SHINE.

â™ª ALL IS CALM â™ª

â™ª AND I FEEL SAFE â™ª

â™ª WHEN I'M WITH YOU â™ª

HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

ASPIRIN?
YEAH.

OKAY.

â™ª FADE AWAY â™ª

MMM.

HEY, IF, UM... IF THANKSGIVING
WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY

IS GONNA BE TOO MUCH, WE CAN
JUST LOCK OURSELVES UP HERE

AND WE CAN JUST ORDER A PIZZA
OR SOMETHING, OKAY?

HMM. YOU WISH.

THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M A CIRCUS ACT.

NO, THEY WON'T. THEY'RE GONNA
TREAT YOU LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO.

THAT'S MY POINT.

LOOK... (sighs)

I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

I KINDA FREAKED OUT.

THIS HAS TO BE
HARD FOR YOU, TOO.

â™ª BY MY SIDE â™ª

â™ª LOVER, HAVE I â™ª

â™ª EVER TOLD YOU â™ª

YOU WANNA DO IT?

â™ª YOU'RE THE ONE â™ª

WHAT? I... (huffs)

THAT'S HOW YOU NORMALLY
APOLOGIZE. I JUST--

I HONESTLY THOUGHT MAYBE
IT MIGHT JOG YOUR MEMORY

A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S ALL.

â™ª THIS TIME â™ª

OH!

â™ª WON'T YOU STAY â™ª

GET OUTTA HERE.

(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

(doorbell rings)
IT'S THE BEST.

OH! THEY'RE HERE, EVERYBODY.

(door opens)
HI! HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
YEAH.

WELCOME.
COME IN, SWEETIE. HMM.

COME ON.
COME ON, HONEY.

OKAY, FINE.


(speaking indistinctly)

OH, MEL. YOU POOR GIRL.

I'M YOUR AUNT CHRISSY.

REMIND HER SHE OWES US
SOME MONEY.

I HAVE A DOCTOR
YOU SHOULD MEET.

100% HOLISTIC.

HIS HYPOTONIC THERAPY
IS REVOLUTIONARY.

LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S A NEW PERSON.

HERE. I BROUGHT YOU
SOME CHINESE HERBS TO TRY.

<i>OKAY!</i>

MEL, I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP IN THE KITCHEN.

(indistinct conversations
in distance)

COME ON IN, GUYS!
FOOD'S COMING OUT!

COME ON, YOU ALL.

GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!

(indistinct conversations)

WHERE SHOULD I PUT
THE STUFF, MAN?

IS THERE ANY ROOM HERE?
SAVE THIS...

(indistinct conversations)

WE ALSO HAVE WHITE.
WHO WANTS RED?

TOO MANY MOVES â™ª

(all cheer)

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª HOME TO ME â™ª

OKAY. THANKSGIVING IS
A FUNNY SORT OF HOLIDAY,

AND EVERY YEAR,
FAMILIES GET TOGETHER

AND CELEBRATE EVERYTHING
THEY HAVE IN THEIR LIVES...

AND THEN BITCH AND MOAN
ABOUT IT.

SO...

HERE'S TO BITCHING AND MOANING!
TO BITCHING...

SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

ONE MORE THING,
AND MEL DOESN'T KNOW THIS.
WHOOPS.

BUT SWEET MELODY'S WON
THE S.B.B. MERIT AWARD.


THEY RECOGNIZE SMALL BUSINESSES

AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE COMMUNITY,

AND MEL HAS BUILT
THAT RELATIONSHIP, NOT ME.

SHE HAS MADE SWEET MELODY'S
A GOOD NEIGHBOR

AND INSPIRED THIS TOWN
TO STAY TRUE TO ITS ROOTS,

SO I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

THAT'S AMAZING.
YEAH.

AW.
MM!

YAY! YAY.

ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO, GUYS.

COME ON, THE FIRST CUT.

FIRST CUT. OH.

YES. OKAY.

HERE WE GO. WE GOT SOME MORE
COMING IN HERE.

(indistinct conversations)

â™ª COULD TAKE HIM,
GONE SOMEPLACE â™ª

â™ª TAKE HIM,
CUDDLE WITH DRINKS â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

YES, I DO.

â™ª COULD'VE TAKEN FAR TOO LONG â™ª

â™ª I WISHED IT ALL ALONG â™ª

(mouth full)
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

â™ª YOU COULD MAKE IT HOME TO ME â™ª

â™ª OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH â™ª

YOU READY?
FOR WHAT?

ICE SKATING.

I DON'T--
I DON'T DO ICE SKATING.

BUT... WE DO.

REMEMBER?

â™ª OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH â™ª

ACTUALLY, I DO.

THAT'S OUR TRADITION.
B-BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO.

NO, I WANT TO.

OKAY.

(chair scrapes floor)
THANK YOU.

â™ª HOME TO ME â™ª

â™ª HOME TO ME â™ª

(indistinct conversations
continue)

HEY, WHY DO YOU
HATE YOUR NAME?

"MELODY"?
YEAH.

I WANNA BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

"MELODY" IS LIKE...
SILLY FLOWER CHILD.

IT'S LIKE ONE STEP AWAY
FROM "CRYSTAL" WITH A "K."

LOOKED IT UP?

I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS?

YES! MELODY.
IT'S A MELODY.

IT'S A MELODY.
A MELODY IS BY DEFINITION,

A SWEET SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS
LIKE SOUND A ROCKING CHAIR MAKES

WHEN YOU'RE HAVING COFFEE
ON THE PORCH...

OR THE SOUND OF YOU
SINGING IN THE KITCHEN

WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN HEAR YOU.

THE SOUND OF YOUR SARCASTIC,
SMART MOUTH

THAT SHOULD ACTUALLY
JUST INFURIATE ME,

BUT REALLY JUST MAKES ME
WANNA KISS YOU EVEN MORE.

DON'T WORRY I GOT YA.

I GOT YA. I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU FALL.



â™ª I GET LOST AND DRIFT AWAY â™ª

â™ª THIS FEELS LIKE A DREAM â™ª

IT'S NOT THE BAHAMAS,
BUT... IT'S OURS.

IT IS. IT'S OURS.

IT'S REAL, ISN'T IT?


IS THAT OKAY?

I DON'T KNOW.

BUT I DON'T WANT IT
TO NOT BE REAL EITHER.

â™ª THIS COULD BE
THE LOVE THAT WE... â™ª

HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

â™ª THIS COULD BE THE NIGHT â™ª

â™ª THAT RIGHTS ALL WRONG â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª WILL LEAVE ALONE â™ª

(train horn blows in distance)

DID YOU GET YOUR SCONE YET?
NO? OKAY, HANG ON.

OH, YOU ARE GONNA LOVE THAT.
UH, LET ME GRIND THAT

FOR YOU BEFORE YOU GO.

CHAR, CAN YOU TAKE BOBBY
HIS SCONE?

OOH, RUSS, UH,

I ORDERED THOSE EXTRA
CHRISTMAS DINNERS FOR THE DRIVE.

SO TELL PATTY TO CALL ME.

OKAY, WILL DO.
OKAY.

FOR SOMETHING BETTER â™ª

ALL RIGHT,
SO I GOT TABLE SEVEN.
PERFECT, YEP.

â™ªâ™ª

YEAH, I JUST ARRIVED.
CAN I GET A COFFEE, PLEASE?

YEAH, I'M RIGHT THERE.

BECAUSE MAYOR GORDON
HAS ASSURED ME

SHE HAS ALL THE VOTES
ON CITY COUNCIL.

LOOK, WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BROKEN GROUND

BEFORE THANKSGIVING.

UH, I KNOW THE INVESTORS
ARE BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

WHAT I NEED IN STREETSVILLE

IS A MOLE ON THE INSIDE
OF THE OTHER SIDE.

APPARENTLY, I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY
AT SAVE NOW WHO KNOWS

WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON
IN THIS TOWN.

BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

PERSONALLY TO SEAL
THE DEAL MYSELF.

OH! OH,
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

OH, THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.
YOU'RE DEAN WILCOX.

HAVE WE MET?

WELL,
THAT'S A LOADED QUESTION.

EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE DEAN WILCOX.

I'M SORRY
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER--

NEITHER DO I.
BUT SOMEHOW I DO.

EXPLAIN THAT.

AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

HEY, MEL.
OH, CARTER.

CARTER McCLURE?
YEAH.

OH, DEAN WILCOX.

YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A HARD MAN
TO REACH.

YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE

PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

OH, BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS
FOR YOU--

NEWS THAT WILL AFFECT
YOUR BUSINESS.

(paper rustling)

WHAT IS THAT, MEL?

THE INN HAS BEEN DENIED
ITS BUSINESS PERMITS.

IMAGINE THAT.

OH, THEY'RE ALL IN CAHOOTS.
THOSE DIRTY RATS.

WELL, THEY ARE OFFERING
DOUBLE MARKET VALUE

IN HOPES THAT WE'LL WALK.

WELL, SINCE THEY WON'T
LET YOU DO BUSINESS ANYWAY,

IT MIGHT BE AN OPTION
TO CONSIDER.

EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

WHAT I WANT IS JUST TO KEEP
WHAT'S OURS.

THAT--THAT'S IT.

I MEAN, WE DIDN'T BUILD
THIS PLACE UP

JUST SO THEY COULD
TEAR IT DOWN.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT.

WE'RE IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS NOW,
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE INN.

NO BUSINESS IN THIS TOWN

CAN COMPETE
WITH A STORE LIKE THAT.

(indistinct conversations)

(gavel bangs)

SETTLE DOWN PEOPLE.

THIS MEETING IS NOW
IN SESSION.

THIS IS
THE FINAL PUBLIC HEARING

FOR THE MEASURE TO APPROVE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE SAVE NOW.


(normal voice) LET ME
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

MY NAME IS DEAN WILCOX.

AND I JUST WANT TO START
BY SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT

THE ENEMY HERE, FOLKS.

SAVE NOW IS
ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE.

WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
THAT NEITHER OF US

WANT A MEGA STORE, THEN.

HEAR, HEAR! MM-HMM.

NOW, COME ON, ELAINE.
THE DATA CLEARLY SHOWS

THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
FOR EVERYONE.

EVEN MEL'S CAFE.

DO YOU INTEND TO TEAR DOWN
MY INN TO MAKE ROOM

FOR YOUR NEW SAVE NOW STORE,
MAYOR GORDON?

THERE IS A LEGAL RIGHT
TO PURSUE CERTAIN PROCEDURES

IF THE CITY BELIEVES THAT

IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST
OF THE CITY.

WHAT ABOUT A MORAL RIGHT?

YOU. (chuckles)

YOU'RE THE WAITRESS WHO
SPILLS COFFEE ON HER CUSTOMERS.

I AM THE WAITRESS
THAT OWNS THE CAFE...

WHERE I SPILL COFFEE
ON MY CUSTOMERS.
(scattered laughter)

WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DO YOU--

DID YOU SHOW THEM
THE SIPHON REPORT?

OH, NO. THAT'S IN-HOUSE
ONLY, ISN'T IT?

THAT REPORT DETAILS
THE EXPANDED MARKET SHARES

OF LOCAL BUSINESSES.

IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THERE IS
AN AVERAGE EXPECTANCY

OF 5 YEARS BEFORE 92%
DOMINANT PROFIT MARGINS

ARE ACHIEVED
IN EVERY DEPARTMENT.

(lowered voice)
HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT?

I HAVE NO IDEA.

(clears throat)
WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

YOU DO HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL LEGAL.

THAT'S HOW YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT, RIGHT?

CAN WE BRING THIS
TO A VOTE?

YES, YES, I MOVE TO--

ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO USE
THE EXISTING PLOT PLAN?

EXCUSE ME?

WHAT ABOUT
THE UTILITY SERVICES?

SETBACK REQUIREMENTS,
THE EASEMENT?


IT'LL RUIN THIS TOWN.

NO, SAVE NOW IS GONNA
RUIN THIS TOWN,

AND WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

NO!

(gavel bangs)

WE HAVE NO INTEREST
IN A FIGHT.

I'M GONNA FILE
A 4-4-1 INJUNCTION.

THERE'S GONNA BE SO MUCH
RED TAPE,

YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO OPEN A TOOLBOX.

WHO ARE YOU?
I WISH I KNEW.

WELL,
YOU FILE YOUR INJUCTION.

IT'LL DRAIN EVERY RESOURCE
YOU HAVE.


YAY, MEL!
WHOO!


CAN YOU REALLY FILE
A 4-4-1 INJUNCTION?

NO, I MADE THAT PART UP.
WHAT?

BUT DID YOU SEE HIS FACE?
HE'S UNNERVED.

OKAY, RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE
AN 11B ZONING PERMIT.

HOWEVER, LAST YEAR
A NEW PROVISION WAS MADE

WHICH REQUIRES
A 6-MONTH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

NOW THEY HAVE TO FILE THAT
WITH THE STATE,

BUT SOMETIMES THEY PURPOSEFULLY
FILE THAT AS A P.E.P.

PROGRESS REPORT
WHICH CAN BYPASS

CERTAIN LINE ITEM REQUIREMENTS.

THEY KNOW IT'S JUST GONNA GET
BUMPED RIGHT BACK

TO ENVIRONMENTAL,
BUT THEIR HOPE IS

THEY ALREADY HAVE ALL
THE STATE SIGNATURES THEY NEED,

SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
PAYING A FINE.

ALWAYS EASIER TO BEG FORGIVENESS
THAN ASK PERMISSION.

ANGELA, I WANT YOU TO GO
TO THE DEPARTMENT

OF BUILDING AND SAFETY.
GET ME THAT 11B PERMIT.

MOM, GO DOWN TO CITY RECORDS.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND

ANY GRANDFATHERED
ZONING LAWS.

MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY
AND THE INN WAS BUILT ON

SACRED BURIAL GROUND
OR SOMETHING.
OKAY.

CARTER, FIND ALL
THE DOCUMENTATION ON THE INN--

TAX RECORDS, PURCHASE
AGREEMENT, EVERYTHING.

YOU SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY
TO BUMP YOUR HEAD.

GO!
OH.

LOOK, RACHEL,
YOU'RE A CAREER POLITICIAN.

I HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT VOTES COUNT MOST FOR YOU.

AND FOR SOME REASON,
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY,

I KNOW IN GREAT DETAIL
HOW SAVE NOW DOES BUSINESS.

AND WHATEVER PROMISES
THEY'VE MADE YOU,

YOU ARE GONNA END UP
FOOTING THE BILL.

THEY'VE ASSURED ME
THE TOWN--

THE TOWN AND SAVE NOW
ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.

JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME,

AND I WILL SHOW YOU
THAT THEY'RE NOT.

WE STILL HAVE 48 HOURS
BEFORE THE COUNCIL VOTES.

BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES
TO FIGHT 'EM, MEL.

BUT WE HAVE SOMETHING BETTER.
SOMETHING WE DON'T WANNA LOSE.

SO WE ARE GONNA FIND
THEIR ACHILLES HEEL

AND EXPLOIT IT.

WHEN I WAS AT SAVE NOW...

COMPANIES LIKE SAVE NOW
PUT PUBLIC IMAGE

ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO THIS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

<i>WHAT INSPIRED YOU</i>
<i>TO TAKE ACTION</i>

<i>AGAINST SAVE NOW?</i>

<i>WELL, SO OFTEN,</i>
<i>PEOPLE FEEL LIKE</i>

<i>THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE.</i>

<i>LIKE THE SYSTEM</i>
<i>IS BIGGER THAN US.</i>

<i>WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING,</i>
<i>NOT IN OUR TOWN, NOT ANYMORE.</i>

YAY, MEL!

<i>LET'S PUT THE PRIORITY</i>
<i>BACK IN THE COMMUNITY,</i>

<i>AND NOT SO MUCH</i>
<i>ON THE PROFIT.</i>

<i>DAVID, OR IN THIS CASE,</i>
<i>MEL VERSUS GOLIATH.</i>

<i>ONLY THIS TIME,</i>
<i>IT'S NOT A SIMPLE STONE</i>

<i>SHE CARRIES IN HER SLING.</i>
<i>IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.</i>

<i>BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH...</i>
WHO THE HELL IS THIS WOMAN?

SHE KNOWS TOO MUCH.

THEY MUST'VE HACKED
OUR SYSTEM.

THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

NOT ON OUR
100th STORE OPENING.

WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
THAT WE COULD TURN THIS

TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

HOW?

BY TURNING IT TO HERS.

(telephone rings)

YOU LOOKED SO GOOD.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
GREAT JOB, MEL.


THIS IS MEL.

AND CONFIDENT.

SHE'S HANGING OUT
ON TV.
SHH!

IT'S DEAN WILCOX FROM SAVE NOW.

UH, YES.

NO, I DON'T--

OKAY, UM, I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 11:00.


(telephone clatters)

WELL, HE WANTS TO MEET
WITH ME.

I THINK WE DID IT.


YES! (exhales loudly)

(siren wailing in distance,
horn honks)

I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR. WILCOX
INTENDS HERE,

BUT I ASSURE YOU
IF YOUR TIME AT SAVE NOW

EXTENDS BEYOND
THIS MEETING,

I WILL MAKE IT
A LIVING HELL.

NO, YOU WON'T, KARL.

YOU'LL SUCK UP TO MY FACE,
AND THEN TALK ABOUT ME

WHEN I LEAVE THE ROOM,
BUT THAT'S BUSINESS.

GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

(phone rings)

MRS. McCLURE.

SO NICE OF YOU TO COME.
MAY I CALL YOU "MEL"?

SURE, DEAN.

YOU'RE SAVVY.
A REAL COMMANDO--

GOOD QUALITIES IN BUSINESS,
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

BUSINESS, RIGHT?

ACTUALLY, I THINK IN THIS CASE
IT'S A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL.

I UNDERSTAND.

PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

I PREFER TO STAND.

YOU INVITED ME HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

BAD P.R.--IT'S NOT SO GOOD
FOR THE BOTTOM LINE, RIGHT?

I THINK YOU OVERESTIMATE
YOUR POSITION.

ALL THIS BAD PRESS--
WE'VE DEAL WITH IT BEFORE.

IT'LL GO AWAY BEFORE
THAT STORE OPENS.

IT ALWAYS DOES.

AND GUESS WHAT?

THE PEOPLE STILL COME
AND BUY FROM US.

THEN WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

WE COULD USE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

YOU'RE SMART, GOOD IN A ROOM,
MADE MINCEMEAT OUT OF ME.

AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE
AN INTUITION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

STARTING SALARY--
$150,000.

CONDOMINIUM, CAR.

LET'S BE HONEST.

SMALL TOWN LIVING
CAN BE NICE,

BUT IT CAN GET
A LITTLE STALE AFTER A WHILE.

WHAT ABOUT THE STORE?

ONCE YOU SIGN ON HERE,
YOU CAN BE MY PERSON

ON THE INSIDE
OF THE OTHER SIDE.

SO YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK
AND TELL THEM THAT WE LOST?

AND THAT I TOOK A JOB
WITH SAVE NOW?

I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
AND TELL THEM

THAT THERE ARE SOME OFFERS

THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO GOOD
TO REFUSE.

CARTER?

YEAH, I'M UP HERE!

SO HOW'D IT GO?

TOLD ME YOU WOULD, UH,

COME TO CHICAGO WITH ME?

YEAH.

WELL...

THEY OFFERED YOU A JOB?

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

WHAT, DO THEY THINK
THEY CAN JUST WRITE YOU

A CHECK AND GET WHATEVER
THE HELL THEY WANT?

$150,000 CHECK AND A CONDO,
NEW CAR.

WHAT, YOU ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED THIS?

OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT FELT KIND OF GOOD

TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW?

CARTER, THAT IS WHO I WAS.

THAT IS WHO
I THOUGHT I WAS, ANYWAY.

AND--AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW I KNOW ALL THAT STUFF.

BUT SOMEHOW
I'M REALLY GOOD AT IT.

FEEL LIKE I'M--

STUCK?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

NO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL EVERYBODY?

THAT YOU GOT A BETTER OFFER?
I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT

YOU'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW?
AREN'T YOU TIRED OF WORKING
YOURSELF TO THE BONE

JUST SO YOU CAN GET AHEAD?
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN CONSIDERED

THAT MAYBE WE ALREADY ARE AHEAD?

THAT'S WHY
I TURNED THEM DOWN.

WHAT?

I TURNED THEM DOWN,
YOU BIG OAF.

MEL--
I ALREADY SAID NO.

OH!

WHOA, YOU OKAY?

YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANNA

NAIL DOWN THAT RUNNER
BEFORE WE OPEN.

SO YOU REALLY
TURNED THEM DOWN?
YES.

WHAT KIND OF SCOUNDREL
DO YOU THINK I AM?

I THINK YOU'RE A CUTE ONE,
SO I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.


WHAT? YOU OKAY?

YEAH, I-I JUST FELT
THIS WEIRD FEELING

ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT
I'M FINALLY READY TO ACCEPT

THAT ALL OF THIS IS...

REAL?

YEAH.
EVERYTHING IS SO REAL.

AAH!
MEL!

MEL?

MEL?

OH, MY GOD.

MEL?

(breathing heavily)

CARTER?

MELODY?

HI.
OH, HONEY, YOU GAVE US
QUITE A SCARE.

OH, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

YOU TOOK A FALL
AT THE INN.

YOU'VE BEEN OUT COLD.

YOU'VE QUITE A LUMP
ON YOUR HEAD, MS. GERARD.

GERARD?

MELODY GERARD?

MELODY McCLURE.

EXCUSE ME?

MELODY McCLURE.

WE'RE MARRIED.

I'M--I'M SORRY.

MARRIED?

INTERESTING.
UH, WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

ELM STREET?

OKAY, DOC, I THINK SHE...
MIGHT NEED SOME MORE TESTS.

OH. (sighs)

NOT AGAIN.

YOU THINK...
THAT WE'RE MARRIED?

YES! NO.

YES? I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

I HIT MY HEAD, AND I WOKE UP
IN THE HOSPITAL.

AND I THOUGHT THAT I WORKED
AT SAVE NOW

AND LIVED IN CHICAGO.

YOU DO.

YES, AND I WAS
CONCEITED AND RUDE.

YOU ARE.
MEL, YOU'VE BEEN OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING.

NO, IT WAS REAL.

AND YOU WERE THERE,
AND YOU WERE THERE.

AND YOU WERE THERE.
AND THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME,

HEY.
AND WE HAD A GREAT BIG
THANKSGIVING DINNER.

SWEETHEART, THANKSGIVING
ISN'T FOR THREE MORE DAYS.

YOU JUST GOT HERE ON FRIDAY.

BUT, OH, I'M JUST SO GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

CAN'T SAY THAT THE REST
OF THE TOWN FEELS THE SAME WAY.

OKAY, UM, COULD I TALK
TO CARTER ALONE?

<i>(P.A. tone chimes)</i>

<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over P.A.)</i>

A DREAM. IT WAS SO REAL.


THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

NO, ACTUALLY, IT--IT IS
KIND OF FUNNY.

WELL, I MEAN, NOT THE PART
WHERE YOU GOT HURT.

BUT SEEING YOU LIKE THIS,
IT'S--IT'S ALMOST THE GIRL

I REMEMBER BACK WHEN...

WHAT?

NEVER MIND. IT WAS LIKE
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.


I'M SO SORRY THAT
I DIDN'T COME BACK SOONER.

BUT I'M HERE NOW.

YOU--YOU HAVE SOME NERVE.

14 YEARS LATER, YOU--
YOU THINK THAT I'M ACTUALLY

HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING?

WELL, I AM SO SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT.

OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WASN'T ALL  <i> MY  </i> FAULT.

YOU DID NOT CARE
ABOUT MY... FEELINGS.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAD ASPIRATIONS.

OH, YOU HAD ASPIRATIONS?
YES, I DID. ASPIRATIONS.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WASN'T READY THEN.

BUT I'M READY NOW.

MEL, W-WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

PUTTING ON MY PANTS.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING?
NO, NOT A GOOD IDEA.

NO, IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

OH, OKAY. THERE IT IS.
SHE'S DOWN.

I'M OKAY. I'M UP.
LET'S GO.

LET'S GO TO
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.
WAIT, WHAT?

LISTEN, BUDDY.
I FELL FOR YOU.

LITERALLY, JUST NOW.
FELL FOR YOU.

SO DON'T BLOW THIS, OKAY?

YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO HELP YOU GET THIS DONE?

NO, TO STOP IT.
MOVE IT!

SO WHY THE SUDDEN
CHANGE OF HEART?

I TOLD YOU,
IT WASN'T SO SUDDEN.

I GOTTA GET YOU BACK.
YOU--YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.

IT WASN'T SO BAD.

ACTUALLY,
IT WAS PRETTY GREAT.
WHAT?

JUST BEING BACK.
BEING WITH YOU.

I SAW YOU LAST FRIDAY.

AND FOR LIKE AN HOUR
THIS MORNING.

OKAY, DON'T PLAY COY WITH ME,
CARTER McCLURE.

I KNOW YOU HAVE MY PILLOW
IN A PLASTIC BAG.

WAIT, HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE 14-YEAR-OLD MAYO

IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR?

YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

ARE YOU--
ARE YOU ON BATH SALTS?

THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE--
THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE.

I BET YOU EVEN LOOKED UP

THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD
"MELODY," DIDN'T YOU?

YEAH, IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S THAT ANNOYING SONG

SO GRATING ON YOUR NERVES...

GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

I LOVE YOU, TOO,
CARTER.

NO, I THINK EVERYONE
WILL BE GOOD NEIGHBORS

ABOUT THIS IN THE END.

THANK  <i> YOU.</i>
YOU, TOO, SIR. BY.

SPEAK OF THE DEVIL,

THAT WAS YOUR BOSS
ON THE PHONE.

DON'T SEND THE LAND DEEDS.

OH, I JUST MESSENGERED THEM

ALL TO THE LAWYERS
THREE MINUTES AGO.

IT'S A DONE DEAL.

IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO
GO TO A VOTE.

CONGRATULATIONS.

(cell phone vibrates)

THIS IS MEL.

MEL? DEAN.

Nice work.
You got 'em, Hammer.

Now I need you
to get back in--

(telephone rings in distance)


OH,
WHAT DID THE MAYOR SAY?

WHAT'S THAT?

"EMINENT DOMAIN."

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

IF THE CITY DECIDES
IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST

OF THE MUNICIPALITY,

THEY CAN TAKE
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

THEY CAN TAKE ANYTHING
FROM ANYBODY, LIKE IT OR NOT?

YEAH.

SO THEY'RE GOING
TO TEAR DOWN THE INN?

CAN'T WE STOP THEM?

NO.

IT'S OVER. I'M SORRY.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

(clanging over door)

(door closes)

YOU OKAY?

MOM, I SHOULD'VE
BEEN HERE MORE,

AFTER DAD DIED, TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WERE OKAY.

BUT I DIDN'T.

I SHOULD'VE COME BACK MORE
OVER ALL THE YEARS AND--

OH, IT WAS A MISTAKE.
A BIG ONE. I'M SORRY.

THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

BUT I UNDERSTOOD.
I KNEW YOU WERE BUSY.

HEY, DID YOU EVER REGRET
LEAVING CHICAGO?
NEVER.

YOU GIRLS WANTED A YARD
TO PLAY IN.

YOUR DADDY AND I
FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS TOWN--

THE PEOPLE, THE ARCHITECTURE,
THE HISTORY.

THE FIRST TIME WE EVER VISITED,
WE STAYED RIGHT HERE.


IN CARTER'S INN.

A WHO'S WHO OF PEOPLE
HAVE STAYED HERE.

BUILT IN 1870, RIGHT?
YEP.

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I LIKE
ABOUT THIS TOWN?

ON ALMOST EVERY STREET
THERE IS AN OLD BUILDING

THAT IF YOU ASK WHAT STOOD
THERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

IT WOULD BE
THAT SAME BUILDING.

WE MAY BE OUTNUMBERED
BY THE MONEY PEOPLE

WHO THINK VALUE
IS IN THE FUTURE,

BUT THERE IS VALUE
IN THE PAST, TOO.

CAN I BORROW THESE, MOM?

SURE.

SO, WHEN ARE YOU
HEADING OUT?

I GET OUT OF DODGE, THE BETTER.

LOVE YOU.

(voice breaks) LOVE YOU.


â™ª WHOA, OH-OH,
SHINE YOUR LIGHT â™ª

â™ª IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE LITTLE THINGS â™ª

â™ª THAT MAKE YOU COMFORTED
WHEN YOU WERE HERE â™ª

â™ª I HAVE WHAT I NEED â™ª

WHOA, OH. HI.

WHOA, RELAX, MS. MIYAGI.
DEAN IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

â™ª LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND â™ª


OH.

MEL, GOOD TIMING.

CONGRATULATIONS
AND A GREAT JOB.

UM, DEAN, I NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE.

IT'S IMPORTANT.

WHAT DO ALL OF THESE
HAVE IN COMMON?

I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE ALL DEAD?

YES, THAT. BUT WHAT ELSE?

MOST OF THESE BUILDINGS
ARE STILL THERE.

THEY MEAN SOMETHING
TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE.

THE--THE PEOPLE THAT
WERE BORN IN THEM,

THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA
DIE IN THEM.

WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

WHAT I'M GETTING--
WHAT I'M SAYING

IS THEY HAD VALUE
WHEN THEY WERE BUILT.

THEY STILL HAVE VALUE TODAY.

DID YOU BUMP YOUR HEAD
OR SOMETHING?

YES, BUT THAT
IS BESIDES THE POINT.

THE POINT IS,
IS WE BREAK GROUND

ON OUR 100th STORE
TOMORROW.

AND WHAT I'M HEARING
FROM MY HAMMER,

IS THAT MAYBE
WE OUGHT TO RECONSIDER.

YES! THESE PEOPLE--

THESE PEOPLE--
I'M AFRAID TO SAY, MEL--

ARE GONNA BE
LIKE THESE PEOPLE

IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH--
DEAD AND GONE.

PROGRESS LIVES ON.

OH, AND WHEN
THIS DEAL CLOSES,

THAT INTERNATIONAL
POSITION'S YOURS.

HEAD OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT?

YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE POSITION?

YEAH, SHARK LIKE YOU,
NO KIDS,

NOTHING TO TIE YOU DOWN.

YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR THE JOB.

(telephone ringing in distance)


YOUR ITINERARY.

ITINERARY?

THE BAHAMAS.
AND CONGRATULATIONS

ON THE INTERNATIONAL GIG.

I ALWAYS KNEW YOU
WOULD GET IT.

THANKS.

(door closes)

<i>(dance music playing)</i>

AND THEN HE SAYS,
"OH, MY GIRLFRIEND

GAVE IT TO ME."

AND I'M LIKE, REALLY?

I JUST SPENT 45
OF THE BEST FLIRTING MINUTES

OF MY LIFE
AND NOW YOU TELL ME

YOU'VE GOT
A FREAKING GIRLFRIEND?

HELLO, EARTH TO MEL?

YEAH?

WHERE ARE YOU?

I'M RIGHT HERE...
WHERE WE ALWAYS ARE.

OH, I'M SORRY.
ARE WE BORING YOU?

WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DREAMS?

WHAT, LIKE, FAILED ONES?

IT WAS SO REAL.

IT WAS LIKE
IT WASN'T A DREAM.

IT WAS LIKE
I WAS REALLY THERE.

BUT I WASN'T. WAS I?

WAS I?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

COME ON, WE LEAVE TOMORROW
FOR THE BAHAMAS.

YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
WE'RE AT A FUNERAL.

AND YOU JUST
GOT A PROMOTION.

WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE DEPRESSED ABOUT?

I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
AT THE AIRPORT.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>â™ª I'M GONNA RULE THE WORLD â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª YEAH â™ª</i>

(switch clicks)

(door closes)

(keys jangle)

(keys clatter)


<i>(Elaine) Mel, it's Mom.</i>

<i>Um, honey, I know</i>
<i>under the circumstances</i>

<i>you don't wanna show</i>
<i>your face around here,</i>

<i>but it would mean</i>
<i>so much to us if you could</i>

<i>just come back home</i>
<i>for Thanksgiving.</i>

<i>But no matter what you decide,</i>
<i>I want you to know that</i>

<i>you're a wonderful daughter.</i>

<i>Okay, bye, sweetheart.</i>



KARL? I NEED YOUR HELP.


PUBLIC ARCHIVES,
1870 TO 1900.

THANK YOU.
OH, AND I'M SORRY

I CALLED YOU A SUCK UP.

(telephone ringing in distance)

NO, NO, NO,
COME ON, PEOPLE.

OH. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

SAMUEL CLEMENS. MARK TWAIN.

MEL.

WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON A FLIGHT TO THE BAHAMAS.

UH, NO, I, UM
HAVE A COUPLE HOURS.

WELL, I'D RATHER STILL
SEE YOU AT THE CEREMONY.

I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
IT'S ALL HAPPENING

BECAUSE OF YOU.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU DON'T WANT ME THERE.

I AM PRETTY MUCH
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

BESIDES, I'M, UH,

LOOKING INTO
A NEW E.P.A. FILING.

YEAH,
WE COULD HAVE A PROBLEM.

DON'T LIKE PROBLEMS,
MEL.

BRADLEY, OUR C.E.O.,
IS FLYING IN FROM NEW YORK.

AND, UH, NOT IN
A VERY FORGIVING MOOD.

I AM WORKING ON IT.

DON'T START UNTIL I SAY SO.

FIX IT
BEFORE BRADLEY FIXES ME.

AND TWO GUESSES
WHO I FIX.

I INTENDED TO.

<i>(Carter) Hey, it's Carter.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

CARTER? HI.
I KNOW I AM THE LAST PERSON

THAT YOU WANT TO TALK TO
RIGHT NOW.

BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, OKAY?

SO CALL ME BACK.

OH!

YOU DO KNOW
TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING?

YES, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

WE USUALLY LIKE
TO CLOSE EARLY

THE DAY
BEFORE THANKSGIVING.

GIVE US MORE TIME
TO PREPARE

FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER
WHICH IS TOMORROW.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

IT'S NO SMALL THING
COOKING DINNER

FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

I'M SORRY.

(line ringing)

CARTER.

THEY'RE ABOUT TO START
THE BULLDOZER.

I CAN'T--I CAN'T EVEN GET IN
TO FINISH GETTING MY STUFF OUT.

IT'S A REAL NICE COMPANY
YOU WORK FOR.

I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

YOU WANT  <i> MY  </i> HELP?
YES, STALL THEM.

AND HOW DO I DO THAT?

USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
(line disconnects)

HELLO?

MEL! MEL,
HOW DO I DO THAT?

CARTER?

(phone rings and beeps)


MOM, MOM, I NEED YOUR HELP.
OKAY, LISTEN.

GET EVERYBODY OVER
TO THE INN

right away.
OKAY.

W-WHAT'S HAPPENING?

DON'T LET THEM
TOUCH THE INN, OKAY?

DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

TELL THEM
TO STALL THE BULLDOZERS.

GOT IT. I'M ON THE CASE.


I NEED YOU
TO FILL THESE OUT.

(indistinct conversations,
camera shutter clicking)

CARTER!

HEY.
HEY.

WH-WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

MEL CALLED MOM.
SHE ROUNDED UP THE TROOPS.

HOW CAN WE HELP?
WE NEED TO STALL THEM.

HOW DO WE DO THAT?



THEY'RE NOT
GONNA BULLDOZE A KID.

LET'S GO FOR IT.

AWESOME!

COME ON, COME ON! UHH.

GET THE SIGNS UP,
GET THE SIGNS UP, COME ON!

GREAT.

(cell phone vibrating)

GREAT.


HERE YOU ARE,
MS. BRADLEY.

(door closes)
THANK YOU, CARLOS.

UH, HI, MS. REYNOLDS?

UM, I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WAITING FOR ME.

REALLY? SO DO I.
27, IN FACT--GUESTS.

TOMORROW.

AUNT CHRISSY'S HERE.

AUNT CHRISSY!
UNCLE JIMMY! HERE!

WE GOT MORE.
COME ON!

AWESOME, YOU'RE AWESOME.
YOU'RE FANTASTIC.

THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, COME ON!

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

(cell phone vibrates)

HELLO?

MEL? WHERE ARE YOU?

THE FLIGHT LEAVES
IN 30 MINUTES.

I CAN'T GO.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.
WE NEED YOU!

NO, YOU DON'T.

BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO DO.

(cell phone vibrating)

I'M SORRY.

I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

WAIT, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

HELLO?

(crowd chanting)
MEL, I THOUGHT YOU SAID

YOU HAD THESE PEOPLE
UNDER CONTROL.


I WILL BE THERE IN 30 MINUTES,
OKAY? JUST WAIT.

(chanting continues)

WELL, EVERYTHING
LOOKS IN ORDER.

PERFECT, OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I NEED TO GET GOING.

THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING.

ALL THIS PAPERWORK
THAT YOU FILLED OUT,

AND ALL THIS PAPERWORK
THAT I FILLED OUT...

RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

IT'S GOING TO TAKE 30 DAYS.

WHAT?

IT TAKES 30 DAYS BEFORE
THE REVIEW BOARD

CAN FINALIZE A NOMINATION
OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

NO, NO.

THE INN IS SET TO BE DEMOLISHED
AT 3:00.

WELL, THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT
IS TO FILE AN INJUCTION

WITH JUDGE STANTON
AND, UH,

GOVERNMENT OFFICES
ARE CLOSING.

OKAY, WHERE IS
JUDGE STANTON'S OFFICE?
UP ON 3.

BUT HE USUALLY LEAVES EARLY!

OKAY, THANKS A LOT!

AH, EXCUSE ME!
JUDGE STANTON.

HI.
I AM NOT JUDGE STANTON AGAIN
UNTIL MONDAY MORNING AT 9:00.

I JUST REALLY NEED YOU
TO ISSUE AN INJUCTION.

UH, WE'RE CLOSED.

NO, I STILL HAVE
ONE MINUTE. SEE?

HOLD ON.
(cell phone vibrating)

SORRY.

HELLO?

(crowd chanting)
MEL, YOU'RE NOT HERE
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES,

THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONNA GO SOUTH.

I TOLD YOU,

I AM GETTING
THE PROPER PAPERWORK.

IF YOU CALL ME
ONE MORE TIME,

I WILL PERSONALLY
RIP YOUR PANTS OFF

AND SHOVE THEM
WHERE THE SUN--

I'M ASSUMING--
HAS NEVER SHINED.

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!
SAVE NOW--

PLEASE, JUDGE. JUDGE.
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

TOMORROW'S THANKSGIVING.
YES.

WE'RE CLOSED.

I KNOW, BUT IF YOU
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING

OF THANKSGIVING
EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT,

THE PEOPLE OF STREETSVILLE,
A LOVELY LITTLE TOWN

JUST SOUTHWEST OF HERE,
WILL BE VERY THANKFUL

IF YOU HELP ME.


IT'S STILL 30 DAYS.

NO, OKAY, OKAY.
WAIT, WAIT.

TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

DOES THIS CHANGE YOUR MIND?

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

MR. WILCOX, SHE SAID 30 MINUTES
30 MINUTES AGO.

I KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'LL FIGURE A WAY AROUND IT.
OKAY.

(engine revving)

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

IT'S GO. GO!

(bulldozer whirring)
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!
SAVE NOW DOES NOT CARE!

GET READY.

COME ON, COME ON,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

OH, YEAH. OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.


(brakes squeal)
HERE SHE IS,
HERE SHE IS.

WAIT, WAIT!
STOP, STOP!

(whistle blows)

WE HAVE TO STOP.
WE CAN'T DEMOLISH THE INN.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

HERE, LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

LOOK AT THE MAN.

THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE.

THAT MAN IS MARK TWAIN.

HE WAS ONCE PART OWNER
OF THIS INN

OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

THAT QUALIFIES THIS
AS A HISTORIC LANDMARK.

I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

WE TOUCH THAT INN,
THEY SHUT US DOWN.

YOU KNOW ACCORDING
TO OUR LAND SURVEY,

THAT THIS IS THE ONLY SITE

THAT SUITS
OUR CONSTRUCTION PLANS.

I'M AFRAID THIS STORE
IS D.O.A.

I'LL FIGHT IT.

I DON'T THINK THIS IS A FIGHT
WE CAN WIN, DEAN.

WE  <i> ALWAYS  </i> WIN, MEL.

DO WE?

WE TALK ABOUT VALUE A LOT
TO OUR CUSTOMERS

AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

I'M WONDERING IF WE NEED
TO LOOK THE WORD UP.

I KNOW I HAD TO. (sighs)

"VALUE, THE REGARD
THAT SOMETHING

"IS HELD TO DESERVE.

"A PERSON'S PRINCIPLES
OR STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR.

ONE'S JUDGMENT OF WHAT ONE
IS THANKFUL FOR IN LIFE."

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOLLARS,
DEAN.

IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE, FAMILIES,
A WAY OF LIFE.

WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT,
WE LOSE EVERYTHING.

MEL?

YOU'RE FIRED.

OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

I THINK SHE'S MAKING
QUITE A POINT HERE.

AND I THINK MS. GERARD
HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE

WITH THIS COMPANY.

THANK YOU, MS. BRADLEY,

BUT I THINK I HAVE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH STREETSVILLE...

AGAIN.

WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

WE PRIDE OURSELVES
ON IMPROVING JOB SERVICES,

A PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES
LIKE THIS.

WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
MR. WILCOX?

YES, MS. BRADLEY.

BUT NOT WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NOT WHEN IT'S NOT WANTED.

I THINK YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT,
TOO, MR. WILCOX?

MM-HMM.

SOMEONE LIKE YOU
HAS A GREAT DEAL

TO OFFER OUR COMPANY.

ACTUALLY, I DO.
I'VE BEEN THINKING

OF PUTTING TOGETHER
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

TO EXPAND MY MOM'S CAFE
TO OTHER CITIES.

LOCAL PRODUCE, FAMILY RECIPES,
BUT THEY COULD BE EXCLUSIVE

INSIDE SAVE NOW STORES.

AH, I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOUR PROSPECTUS.

I'LL HAVE IT TO YOU
NEXT WEEK.

I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU, MEL.

YOU CAN CALL ME "MELODY."

(crowd cheering)


(indistinct chatter)


(indistinct conversations)

HEY, I'M COMING IN.
LOOK OUT.

OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME GRAB IT. I GOT IT.

(all speaking at once)

I AM GOING TO KNOCK
SOMETHING OVER. (laughs)

THIS IS GREAT, MOM.

OKAY.
REALLY GOOD.

I'VE GOT THIS. ANYTHING ELSE?
ANYTHING? ANYTHING?

I'VE GOT TOMATOES.
ALL RIGHT, HONEY,

GET THOSE CRANBERRIES IN.

YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE
MY PRESENTATIONS,

AND I'VE GOTTA HAVE
AN AUDIENCE, SO...

I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING
FIRST.
WHAT, SWEETHEART?

I ADMIRE YOU.

YOU'RE STRONG
AND YOU'RE SMART,

AND YOU FOUND A WAY
TO BALANCE BUSINESS AND FAMILY.

YOU ADMIRE ME?

I DO.

AND IT JUST TOOK ME
A CONCUSSION TO REALIZE IT.

NO, SERIOUSLY.

YOU'RE MY NEW DEFINITION
OF SUCCESS.

YOU HAVE IT ALL.

I DO NOW.

MAYBE SOMEDAY I CAN
HAVE IT ALL, TOO.

YOU ALREADY DO.

COME ON. LET'S GO.

HERE IT COMES, EVERYBODY!
OKAY!

THE PRESENTATION OF THE TURKEY!

(cheers and applause)

(Carter sighs) STILL SET
TO OPEN NEW YEAR'S DAY.

NO MORE RED TAPE, RIGHT?

NO, AS LONG AS EVERYTHING
IS RESTORED

TO ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION.

WELL, IT IS NOW.

â™ª HOME TO ME â™ª

HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THAT IDEA

FOR YOUR MOM'S CAFE?

I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST KINDA DREAMT IT UP.

A CHAIN OF
SWEET MELODY'S.

NOW THAT KINDA HAS
A RING TO IT.

HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS GONNA CALL IT THAT?

I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...
KINDA DREAMT IT UP.

â™ª MY HEART FEELS
SO MUCH LIGHTER â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE PLACE
I CALL, OH, OH â™ª

WHERE YOU GOING?

JUST GOING OVER HERE.
I'M GOING RIGHT HERE.

YOU WANNA GO INSIDE--
NO, HANG ON.

HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW?

NO, NOTHING.
NO.

NOTHING.
(speaking indistinctly)

I WON'T HIT YOU. I WON'T--OH!
COME ON!

I JUST SAID I WOULDN'T HIT YA!
AAH!

THAT IS WRONG! THAT--
AAH!

OH! RIGHT DOWN THE PANTS!

AAH!
MY ONE CATCH IS SHORT--

â™ª YOU'RE HOME TO ME â™ª

â™ª YOU'RE HOME TO ME,
YOU'RE HOME TO ME â™ª

â™ª YOU'RE HO-O-O-O-OME TO ME â™ª

â™ª IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE,
YOU'RE â™ª

â™ª HOME TO ME â™ª
