Fight!

Uh, Iâ€™mma tell you that you not my competition
Iâ€™mma always win, throw me in and Iâ€™m going in

I ainâ€™t running, Iâ€™mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it,talk about it

â€˜cause I really live it
On them nights on a mission,

no fear, no hope in my vision
Donâ€™t need no intervention,

you ainâ€™t down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point â€˜em out,

they all gonâ€™ be missing
Wonder why Iâ€™m still here act a fool if you met me

You try to be brave
and step up with you crew itâ€™s too scary

Plus Iâ€™m too legendary,
Itâ€™s what we go hard for

Iâ€™m rocking your block,
you on top you get knocked off

Iâ€™m taking your place yeah,
I'll make it my property

May be a game to you, probably,
thatâ€™s a way of life for me

And so itâ€™s only right for me,
annihilate â€˜em if they in my way or sight

Keep 'em up off of me,
a weakness in you only make an appetite

Anytime I get into it I be looking at them,
looking pitiful

And their condition it be critical,
nothing less than original

Cross me once that's the end of you

WHO'S NEXT?

Next next next .......

FINISH HIM!

Mortal Kombat X
