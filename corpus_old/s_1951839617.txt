Go, go, go, go!
Move it, move it!

Move it! Let's go!

Move, move! In the car!
Let's go.

Let's go!

There's 4 of you.

You can count.
I'm impressed. Now drive.

Rule one...
Never change the deal.

The deal was
transportation...

for 3 men
with a combined weight...

of 254 kilos.

Yeah? Well,
this is a new deal.

An extra 80 kilos
means we'll not make...

your destination on
the gas I have allotted.

So we'll stop
and get more gas!

Every stop we make
exposes us.

Every exposure...

increases the risk
of getting caught.

An extra 80 kilos means
the Koni shock absorbers...

I installed for this job
will not give us...

the ability
to outmaneuver...

any police that might
be chasing us.

Which means,
if there is a chase...

we lose our advantage,
which also increases...

the possibility
of getting caught.

I don't want
to get caught.

You don't want
to get caught.

Just drive the car, man...

or you're gonna catch
a bullet through the brains!

And who's going
to drive?

Shoot this asshole!
I'll drive.

Not without the ignition
code you won't.

3 men. 254 kilos.

That was the deal.

Argh!

3 men, 254 kilos.

Seat belts.

Argh!

Shit!

Shit!

See what I mean
about the shocks?

Now it's time.

Cop:
Move it, Marcel, move it!

Look out!
Get out of the road!

One way, one way!

We're going
the wrong way!

Stop it,
Marcel, stop!

Move away!

Look out, look out!

Whoa!

Whoo-hoo!

Yes!

Go, go, go!

Merde!

Oh... shit!

If you don't mind...

I just conditioned
the leather back there.

Take us to the drop point!

Not yet.

Aah!

Hello.

The cops, the cops!

What are you doing?
Don't stop now!

Thug 1: Do something!
Come on, do something!

What are you thinking?

Your gun, please.

Police! Stop!

Stop! Police!

I'm fed up with this car chase!

You gave me too much.

We need you to take us to Avignon.

The deal was this far
and no further.

The deal is the deal.
Rule number one.

Rules are meant to be broken.

Not mine.

Let's go. Get in the car.

Come on! Quick!

Move it!

Man 1 On TV:
Really I did.

Man On TV 2:
Oh, yeah, well, how come...

you don't have your
yellow card with you?

Well, I... I...

must've left it
back in Nam on the base.

Yeah, they all say that.

"Left it back in Nam
on the base." Uh-huh.

Let me show you
what we do to people...

who left it back in Nam
on the base.

Oh, no!
Please let go of me!

Where are you taking me?

You gotta be punished
for not carrying...

your shot record on you.
It's a fate far worse than death.

Newscaster: The Argentinian
government reaffirmed...

its commitment to meeting...

the I.M.F's target
this year.

And yesterday, in Nice...

4 men robbed the Alliance
Investment Corporation.

One man died
on the sidewalk.

The others were apprehended
early this morning...

when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street...

in Avignon and ran into
a taxi cab.

The police said...

were it not for their
poor driving habits...

the 20 million euros
in bearer bonds...

would have been cashed
and gone by this afternoon.

And in other news...

I always say the way
a man treats his car...

is how he treats himself.

I'd say that's probably true,
Inspector.

Heh heh heh!
You have a good sense of humor...

for a foreigner,
Monsieur Frank.

Like the French.
Sly wit.

Just the right amount
of flavor.

Been out driving?

Until they pass a law
that says I can't.

You want to come in
for a coffee?

Uh, thank you...

but I have a lot
of stops to make.

88 to be exact.

That's a lot of stops.

A lot of 1999
black BMW 765s...

with 06 in the license
plates to check out.

Oh, it's a very
popular car...

with a certain type
down here.

You've seen them.

They come over from Italy...

in those very expensive suits...

and the young pretty girls...

with the big jewelry
and too much make-up.

Very... Mafia.

There was a robbery.

A getaway.

Some very fancy driving.

By someone in a 1999
black BMW 735?

With 06 on the plate.

You have been
in the city lately?

Not for a while.

I love Nice.
The food...

the way they grill fish.

No place else in France does it...

the way they do in Nice.

And the women...

I prefer the women there.

They are more...
complicated...

than the local variety.

Don't you think?

I don't particularly
like complicated.

You like to keep it simple.

Why are you so interested?

Oh, you know, uh...

ever since
I'm a little boy...

military people
have always intrigued me.

I'm ex-military.

I'm an ex-little boy.

Sure you don't have time
for a coffee?

Everything is always...

so neat with you,
Monsieur Frank.

Nothing ever out of place.

I'll take that as a compliment...

coming from a man who pays
attention to every detail.

Maybe I'll come back
later for that coffee.

Door's always open to you.

Hmph.

Unh. Ahh.

Man On Phone:
Lupo gave me your number.

Be brief.

I'm looking for a transporter.

I'm listening.

Are you ready?

Are you ready...

One bag, that's it.

Dimensions.

Be specific.

One meter fifty
by half meter.

Weight?

50 kilos, not more.

Destination?

24 Rue de Luxembourg.

You're delivering to Mister...

Rule 2... No names.

Time of pickup?

7:00 in the morning
at the front door.

A package,
one meter fifty by fifty...

50 kilos,
250 kilometers...

travelling within
the speed limit...

one stop for refreshments...

40,000.

Half now, half on delivery.

Delivery will be at noon.

If no one's there,
it is not my responsibility.

I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal...

the terms of that deal
cannot be changed...

or renegotiated.

Another rule?

It's rule number one.

Do we have a deal?

You're very precise.

Transportation is
a precise business.

Flat.

Hi.

Now, don't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

I'm just gonna
make a little hole...

so you can drink.
That's all I'm gonna do.

Please... please!
Please, come on.

Come on, drink.

Slowly.

OK, OK, that's enough.

Good girl.

I'm going to take
the tape off.

If you scream,
I'll have to kill you.

You understand?
Mm-hmm.

Aah! I have to pee!

You want me to do it
in your car?

OK.

Mmph!

I'm gonna take my knife out...

so don't scream, OK?
It's to cut you free.

You don't need
your mouth to pee.

You have one minute.

55... 54...

53... 52...

You're breaking
the rules, Frank.

Not good to break the rules.

15...

7...

2...

Time's up.

Don't make me drag you out.

Shit!

Aah!

Aah!

No, please! Nnn!

Rule 3...
Never look in the package.

Hope you enjoyed your pee...

because it's your
last on this trip.

Aah!

See what comes
of breaking the rules?

Yeah, yeah

My music, my life,
my heart, my soul...

Woman:
Jerk!

My wife, my daughter,
my love, my dream

My mother, my father,
my brother, my team

My camp, my squad,
my house, my car

My boat, my shoes,
my pants, my shirt

My coke, my sugar,
my cream, my butter

My toast, my all
my queen, my folks

My baby
walk like 6 strings tall

Talk like she's my everything

You're late.

Ran into a little problem.

Nothing serious?

Nothing serious.

You open the package?

Rule 3...
Never open the package.

Ha! I like that.

Rules.

You can't get anything done
in the world without rules.

You're a foreigner, right?

This is a nice little thing...

you've got going
for yourself here.

High class,
good reputation.

I didn't get your name.

Rule 2... No names.

Of course.

You don't count it?

Why? Should I?

No, no.

That concludes the deal.

You know,
I was wondering...

if you wouldn't mind...

transporting something for me.

That's what you do, right?

You deliver,
no questions asked.

Why not?

Mmm!

Weight?

Oh, maybe a kilo.

Destination?

Grenoble, 306 Rue du Lac...

a Mister...

Oh, right. I forgot.

Rule 2.

Heh heh heh!

I like him.

Thug:
What the fuck?!

Come on!

Oh!

Aah!

Where is he?

Aah!

Uhh!

Uhh!

Mm!

You're like dog shit!
You're everywhere.

Yeah.

I know, you wanna pee.

All you wanna do is pee.

Shit.

I got love

I got love for

My homies
who be rollin' wit me

Play no game

Play no games

Frank, you stupid shit.

I got love

I got love

For my niggaz
on my family tree

I got love

Love for the ghetto,
down for whatever

If you was down before

You gon' still
gon' be down wit me

I got game 'cause
the game was given to me

I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

No long speeches.
Just keep it simple.

Got it?

Who are you?

My name is Lai.
I come from Chi...

Uhh!

I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

You want to try again?

What kind of shit am I in?

Deep shit.
Very deep shit.

Those guys...
Sorry! Sorry!

I won't say any...
Mm!

Bon Appetit.

Where are you going?

To bed.

I can't think straight
when I'm tired.

After a good night's sleep...

I always see things better.

Can I leave?

Be my guest.

Aah!

Hey...

are you comfortable?

Boss...
Shh.

Save your strength.

Just tell me, who did this?

The transporter.

The transporter's dead.

He's not.

Believe me.

I believe you.

And the police?
They were here?

No.

You told them nothing, right?

Right.

Of course...

you couldn't talk.

Yeah.

Let's keep it that way.

I picked them
from the garden outside.

I hope you don't mind.

I didn't know
if you like coffee...

or tea,
so I made both.

I hope you like, uh...

"Ma-de-leine."

Try one.

Careful.

It's hot.

Good?

Let me.

I like it quiet in the morning.

Yes.
Quiet in the morning.

Me, too.
Me, too.

I'm the same way.
I like very quiet.

Sorry.

Are you looking for milk?

There's milk at the door.

Stay, stay.
I'll go.

Hi.

And you are?

The new cook.

Is Monsieur Frank in?

Ah! Monsieur Frank.

Is your invitation
for coffee still open?

Sure, come on.
Please, sit.

Madeleine?

Homemade?

Lai:
Yes.

I'll bring some more.

Ah.

My mother used to make...

fresh Madeleines every morning.

I smell them
and my whole childhood...

comes back in one big flood...

like Proust.

You ever read Proust,
Monsieur Frank?

No.

Ah. He's fantastic.

Memory like a steel trap.

He would have been a great cop.

A real detail man.

Milk?
Please. Mmm.

Thank you.
Ahh.

Tarconi:
I used to have a memory like Proust.

Like a filing cabinet up there.

I would see something
and remember it like that.

Like, uh, license plates.

I could see a plate
and it was printed in my head.

Now I need all
the help I can get...

remembering whose plate...

goes with whose car.

Like, uh, this one.

It's mine.

Ah, memories.

Frank:
So?

Where's the rest
of the car?

I was hoping
you could tell me.

It was stolen.
Stolen?

Yeah, I went down to Frejus
to pick up a few things.

When I came out
of the market, it was...

Gone.
Did you report it?

It's the first on my list
of things to do today.

It's a long walk
from Frejus.

How did you get home?

Well...

I brought him.

I saw him walking
along the dark road.

Mm, a risky thing.

Picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

He had a kind face.

I didn't see
a car outside.

It's in the garage.

May I see it?

Mm-hmm.

Pretty nice car
for a cook.

Some people have a problem
with the Germans.

They're too aggressive.

They take up
the best beaches in summer.

They can't cook worth a damn.

I say anyone
who makes such great cars...

can't be all bad.

I would say your intuition
worked out very well...

for Monsieur Frank,
mademoiselle.

Worked out for both of us.

Bon.

My intuition says
this is probably a good time...

for me to go
file my report.

Where's the rest
of my car?

Oh, yes.

I almost forgot.

It was blown to pieces
at a rest stop.

What's left of it
is down at the lab.

They're trying to separate
what was left...

of the 2 cops in the trunk...

from the rest of it.

But, uh, you wouldn't know
anything about that?

No.

Sorry to interrupt.

Thank you for the coffee
and the memories.

Come back any time.

Would you mind walking me?

Come on.

You have always
been very quiet...

about your business,
Monsieur Frank.

I appreciate that.
Less work for Mother.

But this business
at the rest stop.

That is not very quiet.

I don't suppose you
would like to tell me...

something besides
a stolen car story?

If I had one I would.

Well, may I suggest
that when the 2 of you...

show up in my office
after lunch...

you do have one.

A better one
than you currently have.

You are the one
he wants to see...

not me!

Quiet!

Please, I have to think.

You were supposed
to think last night.

Yeah, well,
last night I had nightmares...

about a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life...

screwed it all up.

Everything she touched broke...

and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

OK. Sorry.

I'm still wondering
if I want to know everything...

or nothing about you.

What?

The quiet.

I thought you liked quiet.

Yeah, not this quiet.

Aah!

You OK?

No!

Good. Let's go.

Uhh!

Aah!

Go! Go! Go!

Uhh!

Aah!
Aah!

No, don't stay there!

No!

Aah!

Aah! Aah!

Frank!

Come on,
give me your hand!

Aah!

Uhh!

Aah!

Aah!
Come on!

Come on, get in!
Get in!

No! No!
Get in!

Lai, look!
Come on, you wanna die?!

Get in!

Calm down, OK?

Don't worry.
You OK?

Stay here.
I'm coming back.

No, wait! Wait!

Uhh!

Aah!

Put it on.

You OK?
Mm.

Sure?

OK, let's go.

Frank?

Is this your house?

Lai:
Frank?

Uhh! Yeah, guess.

Frank.

I should mind
my own goddamn business.

A simple rule.
A simple, little rule.

There's gotta be
some dry clothes...

in this house.

Don't open the package.

Nothing but trouble,
you open the goddamn package.

Lai:
Frank.

What are you doing?

Making up for the trouble.

Wait, wait.

Why are you making...

No more questions.

Wait.

I don't like it
when things get complicated.

You like things simple.

Very simple.

I'm not so clear
about the house.

Could you explain...

uh, one more time.
After I left.

After you left, we went
for a walk on the beach.

Had a swim.
Where again?

Past the point.

Anyone else swimming
at that time?

No.

Did you see
anybody else swimming?

No. No one.

So, you took a walk,
had a swim...

on a beach where no one
else was swimming...

past the point
where you can't see...

or be seen from the beach
on either side...

which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

That's the point
of a romantic swim.

Who wants witnesses?

And then?

Then we came back
to the house...

found it on fire.

Just like that?
On fire?

Yes.

And the 5,000 rounds
of spent ammo...

my men found
all around the house?

Maybe they had
the wrong house.

Monsieur Frank...

people with
this kind of firepower...

do not make mistakes
about who they visit.

Who would want you this dead?

I don't know.

Any problems with a client?

I don't have clients.
I'm retired.

I live on my army pension,
you know that.

You have all the facts
of who I am...

and who I was.
You've had them for years.

Any enemies
you can think of?

People from the past?

I left the past behind
when I moved here.

Huh. A past like yours
you never leave behind.

Commissaire,
on vous demande en bas.

I'll just be a moment.

Don't leave.

What are you doing?

Computers know everything.

You just need a password.

What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.

You're always complaining.

Except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

Aha.

Ah.

La la la

Hello.

See?

So, where will you be staying?

I don't know.

Well, my cousin
has a small hotel.

Thanks, but we'll manage.

Without money,
it would be hard.

Here.
It's not much...

but at least
you won't go hungry.

Thank you.

Where are you going?

Going to see that guy.

Good luck.

One minute.

You're not coming?

No.

But he blew up your car.

I'll buy a new one.

He burned your house.

I'll rebuild it.

He tried to kill you!

And as far as he knows,
he succeeded.

Look, I'm going
to give you some advice.

I don't know
what you were into.

I don't care
what you were into.

But whoever wanted you dead...

thinks you're dead.

You have a free pass
to start over.

Here's the advice:
Start over!

There are 400 people dying...

in a container on a ship.

My father.

My sisters.

The ship arrives today.

They will make
my father a slave.

The only one who knows
the container number...

is that guy.

You're very good.

What do you mean?

The moment you saw
those pictures in my house...

you were setting me up
to get involved in this.

The breakfast.

Giving the excuse
to the cop to help me.

One lie after another.

Not everything is a lie.

Name one thing
that isn't?

What happened in the house...

between us...

that was not a lie.

You were a soldier.

Your job was to save people.

Past tense.

What does that mean?

It means I got tired
of seeing my best efforts...

get turned into bullshit
by the same people...

who paid me to do the job.

No one cared.

This time... I care.

Thank you.

Bonjour.

Bonjour.

No phone calls
for half an hour?

Hello. Surprise!

Sit.

Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

So, before we get
to the heart of the matter...

I have one question for you.

Why'd you try to kill me?

You lied to me.

You opened the package.

You broke the rules.

Your rules.

What did you
expect me to do...

recommend you for another job?

What's the ship number?

Mr. Transporter...

we can both agree...

I answered your first
question politely.

I won't answer any more...

so I suggest
you kill me right now...

and go screw yourself.

I can't find anything.

Oh, poor Frank.
What did she tell you?

We're smuggling people
in containers?

I tell you, Lai's
the perfect name for her.

Secretary, On Intercom:
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.

Your father's here.

He'll really get
a kick out of this.

I thought your father
was in a container.

Yes! I... I mean, no.

There are 400 people
in that container.

Stay where you are!

She's a real heartbreaker,
isn't she, Frank?

10 seconds, 2 choices.

The information on the paper
or your brains on the desk!

Now tell me I'm lying!

9... 8...
Frank: Lai.

Lai, give me
the gun.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

...6... 5...

4... 3...

2...

...one.

Shoot.

Lai!

Would I kill
my own daughter?

Lai.

Come on now.

Put it down.

We'll talk.

She thinks we're smuggling
people in containers.

I don't know where
you get these ideas!

Stay away!

Would you kill
your own father?

Please...

I am begging you.

Stop what you are doing.

I do what I do.

I am who I am.

I'll never change.

So if you're
going to kill me...

kill me.

But if you don't...

get this gun
out of my face!

Give me.

No!

I know he's innocent.

Oh, you have
such a good heart.

Always interested in
saving innocent people.

Well, here's
your big chance.

Drop your gun...

and you will save one.

Kill him!
No!

The police are
on their way up.

What now?
Take her.

Send in Leo.

I need him to wrap
something up.

Just for the record...

there aren't 400 people
in that container.

Only 395 made it here alive.

Frank!

Inspector.
Am I glad you're here.

What is this?

What is this?

This man used
my partner's daughter here...

to try and blackmail us.

Luckily, my security
got the drop on him.

I wanna press charges...
kidnapping...

extortion, assault.

I know this man.

Well, I suppose
in your business...

you have to know all types.

Now, should I call my lawyer?

We'll handle it.

I'll expect all of you...

down at my office
to give your statements.

As soon as I contact
my lawyer...

we'll be more
than happy to oblige.

Ohh. Mmm...

The doctor said
you will have a headache...

for a few days
and then everything...

will go back to normal.

Where are they?

Ah, I think you should
be more concerned...

with where you are.

What got into you?

You were always so careful.

I've got to get out of here.

Oh, well,
with the charges they filed...

you will not be getting out...

for a very long time.

Assaulting a distinguished member...

of the international
business community...

kidnapping his daughter...

extortion.

I'm sorry, Frank.

I would like to help you...

but if you continue
with the same old story...

"I am retired,
living on a pension..."

I need fresh, Frank.

I need new.

For once,
I need the truth.

OK.

They're smuggling people.

From Asia through Marseilles...

in containers.

You know this for fact?

The girl told me.

You believe her?

Yes.

In French we have a saying...

"Never believe the cook."

She's not the cook.

Oh.

I suspected.

You know, Frank...

no one is perfect.

So you're saying
you're gonna do nothing?

No, I'm saying...

I'm going to start
an investigation.

And in the meantime,
the 400 people...

in that container
could be dead already.

But what am I
supposed to do?

There are laws.

Did it ever occur
to you that sometimes...

you have to make
your own law?

Like you do?

At least with me,
it doesn't take 12 months...

to get the job done.

Oh, yes, I know.

That's what I admire
about you, Frank.

All that army training...

all that sneaking around...

a man like you could
probably resolve this case...

in, how long?

12 hours?

Less.

Less?

Impressive.

You would be the perfect man
for the job.

Yes...

if I were out.

Yes...

if you were out.

Anybody moves
and I kill him.

Personne ne bouge.
Baissez vos armes.

Ce type est dingue
et capable de tout.

I met him in the Bahamas

I love that nigga persona

Smoke that nigga marijuana

Get freaky, call me Madonna

Lay on the bed, he follow

Bone him until tomorrow

Make him sing high soprano

Ahh

54-50-50

Mr. Act-Super-Kinky

Baby, what you gonna get me

Is rings for my little pinkie

Money will multiply

Before you run up inside

Make me all weak
and tired, mm-hmm

If this is
how you transport...

I'm amazed you get
any work at all.

Come on and give me a hand.

Maybe I should go with you?

Thanks, but, uh,
I'm better alone.

That is a very small boat...

to fight a very big war.

Yep.

But it's a good boat.

Frank, here.

You'll need it.

Or maybe not.

The shipment's cleared.

Here's the paperwork.

Take the highway
all the way...

to the first exit... Lyon.

Go straight
to the warehouse.

We'll be right behind you
just in case.

OK, we are ready to go.

Lai, dear...

I spent thousands of dollars...

for you to go to school
and learn English.

The least you can do
is speak it.

I hate you.

I'm still your father.

Get her out of here!

Aah!

Give me a minute.

Ohh!

Aah!

Aah!

Yah!

Uhh!

Aah!

Keep him alive.

Let's go!

No, don't!

Let's go!

Aah!

Ohh!

Ohh...

Ohh...

Ohh...

Uhh!

Ohh! Aah!

Ohh!

Oh, shit!

Aah!

Ohh!

Ohh!

Get ready-ready-ready to rock

Get ready-ready-ready to rock

Get ready-ready-ready to rock

Bitch!

Good morning.

Pilot:
Good morning.

Oh...

I'm looking to do
a little sightseeing.

This plane is not
for tourists.

I'm not a tourist.

Frank: Call this guy
and tell him to meet me.

Pilot:
Sure.

Where?

Down there.

Here!

Careful!

Ohh! Aah!

Ohh... Aah!

Move up.

Get down.

Aah!

Aah!

Ahh!

Get closer!

Steady!
No, Dad, stop!

Get away!
Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Kwai, Cocking Gun:
Down!

Hands on your head.

Move!

Watch her.

If she moves
or I don't return...

shoot her!

To the water.

I'm really not
in the mood for a swim.

March!

So, how did
a lowlife like you...

end up with my daughter?

Found her in a bag.
Isn't that where you left her?

You know nothing.

Move!

You got involved
with the wrong girl...

you dumb shit.

The delivery will be made.

My daughter
will get over it.

If I'm lucky,
maybe she'll see the light.

Yeah, if she's lucky
maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

What do you know?

I know she'll never stop
being who she is...

and she'll never be you
or anything like you.

She'll come around...

but you won't be here
to see it.

Lai: No!

I guess she won't be
coming around after all.

Turn around!

I'd rather see it coming.

Makes no difference to me.

He was a bastard...

but he was still
my father.

Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

I guess I underestimated you.
