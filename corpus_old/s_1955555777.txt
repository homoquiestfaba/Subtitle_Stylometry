Have a seat.

<i>Now this is highly irregular, Agent Thorn.</i>

Never had to recall this type of
specialist back into active service.

Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

<i>Saved more lives than
he could possibly know.</i>

Smart, loyal, keen military instincts.

Best I ever served with.

And the family?

<i>Very Supportive.</i>

No, the Wincotts are
military through and through.

They were only happy to lend him to us.

He looks good on paper,

but he's been out of the game for a while.

How do we know he's still got it?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCREAMS)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GROWLS)</font>

Agent Thorn,

meet Max.

Welcome to the Secret Service, Max.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKS)</font>

<i>And Russian president Vladimir Bragov</i>

<i>will be arriving later this week</i>

<i>to attend President Bennett's
first state visit since taking office,</i>

<i>an event that's set to kick
off a full week of arms</i>

<i>negotiations at presidential
retreat Camp David.</i>

<i>These two leaders
couldn't be more different.</i>

<i>The question remains
if Bennett's laid-back style</i>

<i>can handle Bragov's stronger,</i>

<i>- more aggressive stance.</i>
What?

<i>Critics will be watching...</i>

Stronger?

Just because the Kremlin
cowboy hunts tigers,

it doesn't make him strong.

Dad, can I talk to you about something?

It's about school.

Look, these things, they just take time.

You're the new kid on the block.

Look, TJ. Why don't you

invite some of your
new friends over to the White House?

I mean, how many kids your age
have their own bowling alley?

No, I'd love to invite
my new friends over.

If I had any.

<i>Okay, you know, it's kind of
hard to make friends</i>

when every time someone comes
up to you, they get frisked.

We know this is hard, TJ.
It's a big adjustment for all of us.

It's more than just an adjustment, Mom.

It's like living in a fish bowl,

and I'm the only one
who didn't ask for this.

<font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font> Son.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

There have been a lot of kids

who grew up here,
and I'm sure every single one of them

felt exactly the way you do right now.

But I will bet that
they wouldn't trade that experience

for anything in the world.

You know, so,

maybe, do your mom and I a favor

and just try to give it a chance.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

I guess.

That's the Bennett spirit!

<font color=#aa4040>FIRST LADY BENNETT:</font> Go have a <i>good</i> day.

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Bye.
Bye.

Baby bird, hold on.

Don't forget your lunch.

Baby bird? Seriously?

Oh, man. I've gotta get
a cooler code name.

Hey! You're new here.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(WHIMPERS)</font>

And well-trained!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(WHIMPERS)</font>

Well, I guess I know what you want.

Who's a good boy?

Who likes his belly rubbed?

What's your name, fella?
<font color=#aa4040>AGENT THORN:</font> His name <i>is</i> Max.

And he's not here to play.

I wasn't playing with him,
Agent Thorn. I was just...

Okay, maybe I was
playing with him a little.

What's he doing here?

Max is one of the country's
highest-trained tactical canines.

<i>He's been called to duty
to replace Charlie,</i>

who's out on maternity leave.

Hmm. Charlie's a girl?

Let's go, Max.

Now, if you'll excuse us.

We have work to do.

Max, come.

Nice to meet you, Max.

Good luck in the fish bowl.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIREN WAILING)</font>

Hail to the geek.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHILDREN LAUGH)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(TJ SIGHS)</font>

<i><font color=#2aa5ff>(CLEARS THROAT)</font></i>

You know that's cheating, right?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

Does anyone want to trade for a PB&J?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Hit me! You can hit me!

Come on! They're not gonna
do anything to you.

Come on! You can hit me! Someone hit me!

No!

<font color=#aa4040>FEMALE TOUR GUIDE:</font>
And fun fact number 41...

<font color=#aa4040>GIRL:</font> It's TJ.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHATTERING)</font>

<font color=#aa4040><i>FEMALE</i> TOUR GUIDE:</font> <i>It's
First Son, TJ Bennett.</i>

<i>I told you we might get lucky today.</i>

<i><font color=#aa4040>FEMALE TOURIST:</font> I love you, TJ!</i>

<i><font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> It's bad enough that
I had to dance with my mom</i>

at the inauguration.

But now I'm a part of the tour, Coop.
I live here

but I feel like I'm on exhibit
365 days a year.

At least a gorilla in the zoo
gets Christmas off.

<font color=#aa4040>COOP:</font> Look at the bright side, T.

At the zoo, they don't let
you feed the animals.

Think about it.

Worst case, you're only gonna
be here for eight more years.

Less if your dad gets impeached.

Thanks for cheering me up, Coop.

I do hear what you're saying, T.

But for some reason, they put a really
high value on security here.

Did you know that they X-ray
everything that comes into the kitchen?

Even the grapes.

I mean, what can you hide in a grape?

But it's not just that.

I miss my old life, my old friends.

I didn't run for office, you know.

Might just grow on you, T.

Why do you think so many presidents' sons
go into the family business?

Like you said, at least
the food's good here.

I mean, what do you put
in these things anyway?

Secret ingredient. Hold on.
That one's still probably

a <i>little bit hot-
Hot! Hot!</i>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(DOG BARKS)</font>

Hey, Max! Come here, boy!

Come here, boy!
<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKS)</font>

Hi.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font> Good boy.

<font color=#aa4040>MAN:</font> We'll get right on that.

I want someone on the ground
at 0800 hours for this situation.

Hey, TJ.

Who's your new friend?

Sit, Max, sit!

Good boy. Meet Max, our newest addition
to the White House staff.

Well, hello, Max.

I hope I can count on your
vote in the next election.

Oh! Yes! What a good boy!

Yes, what a good boy!

Uh, Dad, I don't think

Agent Thorn wants anyone to
be playing with Max like this.

TJ, come on.

I'm the President of the United States.
I'm pretty sure petting any dog

I want is in the constitution.

Isn't that right, Max?

Yeah, isn't that right?

<i><font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color=#aa4040>AGENT THORN:</font> Mr. President,</i>

I apologize. Our new security canine

shouldn't have left his station.

We're still getting him up to
speed on his duties here.

Good, then it's not too late.

Too late for what, sir?

To add a few more duties.

Like playing with TJ on his off hours.

Sir, as head of White House security,
I must voice my concerns.

This is an important week.
And I would hate for the dog to get

confused about his purpose here.

<font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font> Noted, Agent Thorn.

But I'm sure a man with your abilities

can find a way to accommodate
this simple request.

Otherwise, I'd have to
issue an executive order.

Get the Supreme Court involved.

You know, it can get really messy.

Of course, Mr. President.

Thank you, Agent Thorn.

Well, you see that, TJ?

This morning, I told you
things would turn around for you here.

And President Bennett always
delivers on his promises.

Thank you, Dad. Come on, Max!

Come on, Max! Let's go!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</font>

<i>War hero, veteran, and now Secret Service?</i>

<i>Tactical canine Max</i>

<i>is on loan to the White House this week
to help out with the Russian state visit.</i>

<i>And by the looks of things,
he's making himself quite at home.</i>

Who wants the ball? Who wants the ball?

Who wants the ball?

Hey!

<i><font color=#aa4040>TA:</font> Good boy!</i>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIREN WAILING)</font>

Let's go, Max.

I'm TJ.
Alfred.

Max, security detail.
Cool.

<i>Lunch today'?</i>

Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

That's cool.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SONG PLAYING ON PIANO)</font>

Mom, Dad, can I go to a party tonight?
A kid at school invited me.

Oh. I'm sorry, honey.

Tonight really isn't
the best time for this.

TJ, you know that the Russian
president is gonna be here...

What's that gotta do with me?

Look, I know that this
has been really difficult,

but we are the First Family and that
job has responsibilities.

And you know what?
We were hoping that you could help us out.

See, President Bragov's
wife couldn't make the trip,

but he is bringing his kid, Alex,

who just happens to be about your age.
TJ: Wait.

So you want me to babysit
some Russian kid?

Well, we were hoping that
you would see it more as

being our "goodwill ambassador."

Well, I was hoping

I would have a vote
on anything that goes on in my life.

It's not fair and there's no
way I'm dressing up

in a fancy outfit and smiling
for the cameras

just so you can get your poll numbers up.

Look, I'm sorry, nope.

I am just not doing it.

TJ, what is on your face?
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> Mom.

Mom!
Hey, hey, hey,

Dad, she's a girl.

Yes, Alex is short for Alexandra.
I hope that's not a problem.

President Bragov, it is an honor to
have you here as my guest.

Honor?

You seem to have changed
your tune since campaign

when you called me, what was it?

"Crazy Kremlin cowboy."

<font color=#2aa5ff>(LAUGHS)</font>

You must be tired, let me
show you your quarters.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

He seems nice.
Yeah.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> I'm supposed to be nice to you.

I am to be polite, nothing more.

My name is Alexandra Bragov,
but you may call me Alex.

I'm TJ.

I know, I had briefing about you.

They say you are very
resourceful and fine player of baseball.

Also a big fan of spy movies

and always eat ice cream too
fast and get brain freeze.

They know all that about me?

My papa's people are very thorough.

But no mention of dog.
Oh.

This is Max.

But he's not my dog.

I mean, I guess he is now,

but, um, not later or before.
Do you know what breed he is?

Oh, he's a Secret Service dog.

I mean, I know it's not a breed.

He's a...
Belgian Malinois.

How'd you know that?

I am, how you say? Dog person.

Oh, yeah? Me too.

Tell them to put that in my file.

So, TJ, do you think your "dog-for-now"

could help us sniff out something
to eat other than boring state dinner?

I think I know just the place.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

Oh! No, no, you Malinois!

In borscht, we slice
beets thin like paper.

My president...
Dimitri!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

I misspoke.

It is honor to be in
such beautiful kitchen.

Even if you do not belong here.

I assume he came with you?

<i><font color=#aa4040>TA:</font> Hey, Coop.</i>

Meet Alex, she's from Russia.

Call me Coop, I'm from Brighton Beach.

Pleasure.

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Say, Coop,

would you like to whip us up a
couple of the house specials, please?

Why, of course, sir.

Anything to get me off borscht detail.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

Mmm.

Mmm.

<i><font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> Such flavor!</i>

Why is this grilled cheese so good?

Sorry, secret ingredient.

It's classified.

You do not know, do you?

Nope.

So what do you do for amusement here?

Well, do you like to bowl?

Not particularly.

Me neither.

There's all kinds of stuff here,
but they're no fun to do alone.

And under 24-hour watch.

And let me guess, many
important "responsibilities."

No kidding. Sometimes,
I feel like I'm just here for photo ops.

At least you do not have to stand for
eight hours at the Victory Day Parade.

Doesn't even compare to
visiting the Iowa State Fair.

They make sculptures out of butter.

Why?
I think there isn't much to do there.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

I was actually invited
to go to a party downtown tonight.

But I can't go 'cause I have
to entertain our guests.

Well, I hope they're at least nice.

Not so bad so far.

I know how this goes.

You can't go to your party because your
parents are making you go to their party.

It's not fair.
Just 'cause we're the presidents' kids

means we don't get to have any fun?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

Sneaking out to party would be fun.

It would, wouldn't it?

But if we got caught...

Siberia?

I was going to say Guantanamo.

Same difference.

But do you always obey your parents?

Me? Not always.

Sometimes.

Okay, pretty much always.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

I just thought I was in
"land of the free and

"home of the brave."

Don't worry, Max. We'll be right back.

Let's go, come on.

Tomorrow morning, we'll be
heading to Camp David.

I know how much you love the outdoors

and I thought it would
be a more informal venue for our talks.

We will see.

Of course, the brunt of our time will be
spent discussing the arms treaty,

but we've got all sorts
of great events planned for your visit.

My beautiful wife here
is an esteemed concert pianist.

She's agreed to perform
an evening of Tchaikovsky.

Pyotr Tchaikovsky?
Yes.

I love Tchaikovsky.

But everywhere I go,
they play me Tchaikovsky.

I was hoping for Bon Jovi.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

Well, I hope the kids
are getting along better than we are.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GASPS)</font>

<font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> TJ.

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Don't look down, Alex.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

You know, we could get
in a lot of trouble here.

My father always says,
"There is no reward without risk."

Mmm. Mmm.

Thomas, Maureen,

I hope you are enjoying the
borscht as much as I am.

Well, I have to say,
this is the best borscht I've ever had.

It's wonderful.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>

All righty. Now, say hello
to President William Henry Harrison,

<i>who caught pneumonia at his inauguration,</i>

<i>and, fun fact number seven,

Mom, you should've seen Max out there.
He was like, like, like a superhero.

We were worried half to death.

Agent Thorn, how is this even possible?

Unfortunately, sir,

due to the restoration, the alarms on the
windows have temporarily been turned off.

I'm really sorry, Dad.

Let's go through this again.

Is there anything you can
remember that might help us?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

Okay. I didn't wanna
say anything in front of our guests

but I think I heard one of
those guys say something in Russian.

<i>Max bit one of the guys on the ankle.</i>

Dad, you have to check every one of
those Russians for bite marks.

Son, let's just let the
Secret Service handle this, okay?

You mean the Secret Service

who can't keep track of
two 12-year-old kids?

Okay, I think that you have
caused enough trouble

for one evening, young man. Don't you?

But, Dad, all I'm...
No, <i>I</i> don't wanna hear it.

I want you to go to your room, go to bed,

we will discuss your
punishment in the morning.

Fine. Come on, Max.

If he did hear someone speaking Russian,

<i>maybe there are bad
players on the other team.</i>

<i><font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font>
We can't make unsubstantiated</i>

accusations with the entire
world watching, Agent Thorn.

But, Thomas,
if somebody is looking to hurt...

It's okay, Maureen.

<i>We'll be</i> fine at Camp David.

<i><font color=#aa4040>FIRST LADY BENNETT:</font>

<font color=#aa4040>AGENT THORN:</font> My agents have been on site</i>

securing the grounds for the past 30 days.

If there is something going on, there is
no safer place for us to be right now.

Yeah, no safer place to be, because you
and I are gonna be there. Right, Max?

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Come here, Max.

<i><font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Sit,</i> Max.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

<font color=#aa4040>AGENT THORN:</font> <i>Max,</i> come.

Perimeter search.

Go on, boy.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

Hi.
Hi.

TJ.

What's going on?
Why are you being so weird?

I was thinking we could get together later

and talk more about
what happened last night.

No.

I can't.
What?

Why not? What's going on?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> <i>I</i> don't know.

Maybe 'cause the only person who knew
I was going to that party was you.

In fact, you pretty much made me go.

TJ, why would I kidnap myself?

How better to make it look
like you're not involved?

Um, just off the top of my head,

maybe not sneaking out with you
in the first place?

That's exactly what
a Russian spy would say.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

<i><font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font>
I'm so glad that you decided to continue</i>

the peace talks, Vladimir.

I'm hoping that
we can jump into it right after lunch.

No, no, no, after lunch, we ride.

We... We ride?

My people, many think best way
to keep Mother Russia strong

is to keep Uncle Sam weak.

But I think strong can work with strong.

So we ride as men.

Then, I know how strong you are.

Okay.

Come, Mr. President!
Let us feel the wind on our faces!

Atta boy!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(HORSE NEIGHING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(LAUGHS)</font>

We ride like men!

Yippie Jovi yo ki yay!

I'm serious, Coop.

If one of the Russians does
wanna stop the talks,

it'd have to be someone
who came with Bragov.

Someone who's not happy to be here.

Someone like...

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

Him.
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)</font>

"Authentic Jovi Alfredo!"

Even their food is bland and
stolen from other countries!

You sure about this, T?

Think about it. He was also in the kitchen
when Alex and I were sneaking out.

And he sure doesn't seem like
a fan of America. Does he?

Careful with this, T.
You never know where things can lead.

Don't worry, Coop.

What does it looks like? I'm making famous
homemade Russian rye bread.

Bread?
Da.

Finally put stop to dry,
tasteless monstrosity

your buddy, Coop, insists on making.

Now you ruin surprise and dough!

Security hear about this.

And then I tell your mama.

Wait, no. I wasn't here
to ruin the surprise.

I was here because... I... Um...

Because the US President is allergic.

Alex?

Allergic?
Yes.

That is why American chef make dry bread.

It's gluten free.

Oh, oh, yeah. My dad gets
real sick if he has any gluten at all.

Didn't you hear in the last campaign?

It was a huge scandal.

<i>The wheat growers association
wouldn't endorse him.</i>

The pizza lobby picketed his events.

I just wanted to stop you
before you got in big trouble.

Yes, you owe this boy
a great debt and apology.

Don't you?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKS)</font>

My humble apologies.

Now, come on, TJ. Weren't you going to
give me a tour of the grounds?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GROANS)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font> What did you think?
He had body in box?

I don't know. l...

That was stupid, right?

Not as stupid as thinking
I was behind the attacks.

Sorry about that. I didn't
know who to trust and...

It's okay.

You knew I was innocent. Didn't you, Max?

Uh, how did you know we were out here?

I was doing my own
investigation and saw you doing yours.

You were investigating me?

Someone is looking to hurt
both of our families, TJ.

You think I am not worried, too?

You would have known this if you
actually talked to me this morning

instead of putting me on Most Wanted list.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> You're not gonna let
me live that down, are you?

Not until it stops being fun.

So, who do you think is behind it?

Her?

<font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> <i>Before trip, I heard Olga say
she thought arms talks with your country</i>

were terrible thing.

Would make my country weak.

In America, everyone is
innocent until proven guilty.

I also saw her applying
antibiotic ointment

to her ankle this morning
like she has fresh wound.

Hope she looks good in orange.

Stop staring at her.

Well, if I'm not staring at her,

how am I supposed
to know she's doing anything suspicious?

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

Would anyone like to sample
today's blue plate special?

Thanks, Coop.
She's cute, T.

Honey, do you want me
to get you some more ice?

A glacier wouldn't help.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTS)</font>

Oh. Morning, Vladimir.

How was your sleep?

The sleep of 1,000 men. You?

Who wouldn't feel great after
a four-hour ride on Diablo?

Good, then, well rested.
We go white water rafting today.

White water rafting.

You know, I was hoping that we could just
jump right into our talks.

No, today we ride the rapids.

<font color=#aa4040>BOTH:</font> Like men!

Maybe I'm not hating
him as much as I thought.

Seems we're having more
in common all the time.

I'll send for your chiropractor.
Thank you.

Yeah.

Morning, kids.

Hey, Dad.
Morning.

Come on, let's follow her.

TJ. Maybe we should tell
somebody about this.

We will, as soon as
we've got proof. Come on.

Wait.

Are you scared?

Aren't you?

Why should I be scared?

We've got Max.

I am very disappointed in you, TJ.

Maybe you are

If you cannot control your son,

Okay. Bragov, it takes two to tango.

<i>That is true, but I must do this.</i>

Hand it over, Alex.

Hand what over?

What you got from your

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

There will be no more of this foolishness,

and you are not

But, Father, I...
No.

I was wrong to bring you on this trip.

I thought it would be good for you.

But now, I can see it has
been quite the opposite.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCOFFS)</font>

Uh, Vladimir, are we still going rafting

jump into negotiations?

<font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font> Okay.

I thought we agreed that you
would stop spying on people.

But they're spying on people, too.

That is their job!

My job is to protect you.

Mr. President...
Agent Thorn, please.

With all due respect, sir.

I think perhaps we should consider
bringing in another tactical canine

<i>to replace Max.</i>

<i>He's clearly been confused
by his time with your son.</i>

Agent Thorn,

that is your way of saying
"I told you so"?

Very subtle.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> Sir.

<i><font color=#2aa5ff>(CLEARS THROAT)</font> TJ,</i>

I think it's time that maybe we made

a change with Max.
No, Dad. It's not Max's fault, it's mine.

Yes, TJ, that may be

You can't take away my only friend.

My daughter was almost killed.

I do not want to hear any more
of your sincere apologies.

We inspected the raft
fully before embarking.

It must've gotten caught on
a sharp rock or some flotsam...

Or someone tried to sink it on purpose.

TJ, on purpose?

We went over this.

Dad, did you feel us hit anything?

Because I know I didn't.

And do you really think it's a coincidence
that we were all attacked...

Okay, TJ, enough!

You heard Agent Thorn, it was an accident.

But I just...
<font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font> Don't!

I don't wanna hear another word. Drop it.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(INDISTINCT CHATTERING CONTINUES)</font>

TJ?

TJ?

Over here!
<font color=#2aa5ff>(GASPS)</font>

Don't scare me like that.

Sorry.

Did anyone follow you?

Just you.

Payback for when you followed me.

I think I know who's trying
to stop the talks.

Agent Thorn.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(EXCLAIMS)</font> That's a relief.

I thought you were going to say
something crazy, like Agent Thorn.

I'm serious.

Think about it.

Where was he when we all
went overboard today?

And it was his job to check the raft.

And it was his job
to follow up on all leads

for both attacks.

Exactly. And all that stuff about Max
not spending time with me?

He probably knew he'd sniff him out.

He also could've intentionally
let us sneak out to go to that party

so you'd get attacked.

I knew it, an American is behind this.

Wait. Who said he was American?

He could really be a Russian in disguise.

A double agent.

Remember the accent we heard that night?

He was probably faking that accent
to make it seem like he was Russian.

An American posing as a Russian.

A triple agent.

Or he's a quadruple agent.

Really a Russian,
faking the accent of an American,

doing a Russian accent
so we'd think he was American...

Okay. Maybe we should
stop at double agent.

Russian or American.

I can live with that.

So, wait.

Are we really accusing the head
of your presidential security...

Of what is basically treason
with almost no proof?

My dad will think I'm crazy.

And as much as my papa would like to
embarrass your country,

I think he would, too.

So, we set up a trap to
expose him to our fathers.

Saving the arms talks.

<font color=#aa4040>BOTH:</font> And the world!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(BOTH SIGH)</font>

<i>My papa will not

You couldn't leave it alone, could you?

Nope.

Thank you for coming, Bragov.

It's my pleasure, Mr. President.

I am afraid Alexandra

The Hawk's on its way, sir.

We'll have eyes in the sky
in less than 10 minutes.

They can't have gone far, so, I set up...

They'll never find her at this rate.

<font color=#aa4040>AGENT <i>THORN:</font>
Depending on which direction they've gone,</i>

<i>we'll have to split up our resources.</i>

Come here, Max.
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SNIFFING)</font>

Seek, Max, seek. Seek, Max, seek.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(BARKING)</font>

Everybody!

If you wanna find her, follow Max.

<i><font color=#aa4040>MAN:</font> All right, men, move out. Go, go, go!</i>

There's Max!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTS)</font>

Tsk, tsk. It's not safe
for you to be in woods alone.

<font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> <font color=#2aa5ff>(SCREAMS)</font> <i>Help!</i>

<i><font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font>

Look what Max found.
That is Alex's.

TJ, get in, come on!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(YELLING)</font> Wait till my father
gets his hands on you two!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(CLOSING DOOR)</font>
Rotten door.

Told you not to get an American car.
<font color=#2aa5ff>(ALEX GRUNTING)</font>

Go, go, go! Come on!

Max, find her, please!

All units! We need to cut off
all access routes north of the river.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTING)</font>

Shut her up!

<font color=#2aa5ff>(ALEX SCREAMS)</font>

Naughty little girl.
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCREAMING)</font>

<i><font color=#aa4040>OLGA:</font> <font color=#2aa5ff>(GRUNTS)</font> Naughty!</i>

Naughty!

I got her!
<font color=#2aa5ff>(SCREAMS)</font> No!

<i><font color=#aa4040>OLGA:</font> I got you!
<font color=#aa4040>ALEX:</font> Stop, stop!</i>

I hate that dog!

Get him off me! Get this animal off me!

<font color=#aa4040>MAN:</font> Take her away.

We would've gotten away with it, too,

if it wasn't for these meddling kids
and the dog!

<font color=#aa4040>TJ:</font> Hey, Coop.

I know everyone in maximum security's

<i>gonna love your grilled cheese!</i>

Listen, TJ,

I am so sorry that I didn't listen to you.

It's okay, Dad.
No, it's not okay.

We may be the First Family,
but we are a family first.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(PANTING)</font>

I know how difficult
this must've been for you to be

ripped out of your old life.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SOFTLY)</font> I promise you,

I am going to do everything I can
to make your new one a little easier.

Oh...

I love you.

<i><font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BRAGOV:</font> Alex, I am flying in</i>

my personal physician
to make sure you are all right.

Papa, that is not necessary.

But there is something
that you can do for me.

Just say the word, my precious angel.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(OVER <i>SPEAKERS)</font> I'm pleased to announce
that we've come to terms</i>

<i>on a historic nuclear arms treaty.</i>

<i>One that will keep
both our countries strong.</i>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SHUTTER CLICKING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(OVER SPEAKERS)</font> And one more thing.

<i>We wouldn't be here today</i>

<i>if it weren't for someone very special.</i>

<i>Now, this may be a little bit unorthodox</i>

<i>but also incredibly deserved.</i>

<i>I am pleased to present</i>

<i>the very first ever K-9 Medal of Honor
to an amazing dog named Max!</i>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SHUTTER CLICKING)</font>

You really have to leave tonight?

Why, do you want to accuse me of
another conspiracy before I go?

You're not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

Like I said, not until it stops being fun.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> I was right about one thing,
though.

What is that?

A Russian was behind it.

But he was undercover as
American in White House.

So, we call it even?

I'll take it.

<i><font color=#2aa5ff>(CLEARS THROAT)</font></i>

What was that?
<font color=#2aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

Excuse me.

Sorry to interrupt.

But I'm afraid

Max's time with us has come to an end.

I'm really gonna miss you, Max.

We all are.

<i><font color=#aa4040>TA:</font> I know you're gonna miss me too, boy.</i>

Go on.

<font color=#2aa5ff>(ENGINE STARTS)</font>

He sure is some dog, huh?

Yeah...

It's not gonna be the same
around here without him.

TJ?

Why don't you come with us?

I think we may have something
that'll cheer you up.

Come on.

<i><font color=#aa4040>PRESIDENT BENNETT:</font>
These are Charlie 's puppies.</i>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(PUPPY WHIMPERING)</font>

<font color=#2aa5ff>(ALL WHIMPERING)</font>

Hi, guys.

Who wants to play with TJ?
<font color=#2aa5ff>(ALL BARKING)</font>
