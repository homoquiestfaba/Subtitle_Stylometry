[ELECTRONIC BEEPING]

-AN EXPONENTIAL
EXPANSION EVENT

CAN BE EXPECTED
IN SHORT ORDER.

IN OTHER WORDS, A SUPERNOVA.

THE SUN IS NEARING
CRITICAL MASS.

SURFACE SOLAR ACTIVITY

WILL GROW IN VIOLENCE
AND FREQUENCY

FOLLOWED BY EXPULSION CYCLES,

WHICH CAN BE EXPECTED

TO INCLUDE EARTH

IN THEIR TELEMETRY.

SUDDEN FLARES AND NEUTRINOS

TRIGGERED BY
THE COMPRESSION WAVE

HITTING THE SOLAR CORE.

INCREASED MAGNETIC CONNECTION--

S.I.D.--

SUDDEN IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE.

-MORNING, DR. SHEPARD.

I WAS JUST WONDERING

IF YOU GOT THOSE
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
DISTURBANCE REPORTS.

YOU KNOW, THE ONES
YOU ASKED DR. RICHARDSON FOR?

-UNFORTUNATELY, I DID.

-EXCUSE ME?

-THEY WERE FINE, GINNY.
JUST--

-I CROSS-CHECKED THE ANALYSIS
AGAINST OUR DATA FROM MOSCOW.

EVERYTHING SEEMED IN ORDER,

BUT I'D BE HAPPY
TO COME OVER THERE.

-I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

-OK.

-GINNY...

THANKS FOR THE HELP

THESE PAST FEW MONTHS.

BE GOOD TO YOURSELF.

SURF'S UP.

-THAT'S HIM.

[CAMERA CLICKS]

-WE JUST PICKED HIM UP.

HE'S ON THE MOVE.

-LET'S GO.

Man on radio: WELL, I CAN'T
SEE THESE MAGNETIC STORMS,

BUT I'LL TELL YA,

YOU CAN FEEL IT,

'CAUSE IT'S PLENTY HOT
OUT THERE.

AND, UH, LET'S TURN TO

OUR VERY OWN DR. SHEILA.

SHE'S GOING TO BE
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS...

THAT'S 50,000 IN U.S. DOLLARS,

ANOTHER 25 IN EUROS,
AND...

5,000 IN GOLD COINS.

-ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU WANT TO
EXCHANGE THIS MUCH CURRENCY,

DR. SHEPARD?

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]

BETTER CALL THIS IN.

GOTTA GO.

WE'RE HERE AT
MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN
NEAR DOWNTOWN

WHERE THE MAYOR LAUNCHED
HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN
ONLY LAST WEEK.

BUT EVENTS HERE TODAY
HAVE GIVEN NEW MEANING
TO THE TERM "LAME DUCK."

APPARENTLY THESE DUCKS
TOOK A WRONG TURN

ON THEIR WAY NORTH
TO THE MEDITERRANEAN,

ENDING UP HERE FOR
THIS UNPRECEDENTED VISIT.

ORNITHOLOGISTS BELIEVE

THE DUCKS MIGRATE USING
ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERNS
IN THE ATMOSPHERE,

BUT THOSE PATTERNS HAVE
APPARENTLY BEEN DISRUPTED.

IN FACT, ERRATIC
MIGRATING BEHAVIOR

HAS BEEN REPORTED
ALL OVER THE CONTINENT.

THE CAUSE: SUNSPOTS.

-CLEAR.

-ALL RIGHT,
THAT'LL BE THE LEAD-IN.

THEN WE'LL DO
SOME B-ROLL,

AND THEN I'LL DO
THE WRAP-UP.

HEY! LAY OFF
THE FERRAGAMOS.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

-WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

SOME EASY MONEY?

-SPEAKER'S CORNER COFFEE SHOP.

-CHECK THIS.

[TIRES SCREECH]

-DR. SHEPARD?

Woman on P.A.:
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

FLIGHTS 12, 48, AND 16

HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

PLEASE SEE A TICKETING AGENT

OR WATCH THE MONITORS
FOR UPDATES. THANK YOU.

-AUSTIN.

AUSTIN?

Woman on P.A.:
FLIGHTS 12, 48, AND 16

HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

PLEASE SEE A TICKETING AGENT

OR WATCH THE MONITORS
FOR UPDATES.

[ALARM BEEPING]

-OH.


[BEEPING STOPS]

-CODE'S MY BIRTHDAY.

PRETTY COOL, HUH?

-YEAH, PRETTY COOL.

I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

MMM.

-OH, GOD.

HEH.

I THOUGHT...

-I'M SORRY. I FORGOT

THAT THEY WERE STARTING
THE INSTALLATION THIS W--

IT'S LOUD.

-THAT'S THE IDEA.

-WE, UH, REALLY NEED TO
HAVE THAT ON DURING THE DAY?

-IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER,

ESPECIALLY IF I'M HERE ALONE.

-WELL, JUST A FEW MORE DAYS.

JUST A FEW MORE DAYS.

HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO HURT YOU AGAIN.

-DO YOU HAVE TO GO
INTO THE OFFICE TODAY?
YOU JUST GOT BACK.

-WELL, I PROMISED HANDEY
AN UPDATE ON THE MEETING

WHEN I GOT IN.

I WON'T BE LATE.

[PIANO PLAYING]

-HALEY'S RECITAL'S
TOMORROW NIGHT.

-YEAH, I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.

-YOU'LL PICK US UP?

-WELL, IF I GET HELD UP,
I'M SURE TERESA COULD DO IT.

-CHRIS.

-I'M NOT GONNA MISS IT.

-LIKE YOU DID THE LAST ONE?

-HONEY, THE SOLAR PROBE
GOES ONLINE

IN LESS THAN A MONTH.

THINGS HAVE BEEN JUST
GOING CRAZY AT THE SHOP.

-THINGS ARE ALWAYS
CRAZY AT THE SHOP,

AND IT'S ALWAYS YOU WHO
HAS TO CALM THINGS DOWN.

-IT'S MY JOB.

IT'S WHAT I DO.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

Haley: I'LL GET IT.


-AUSTIN SHEPARD GETS
TO SPEND ALL HIS TIME

STARING AT THE SKY

WHILE THEY SEND YOU,

A BRILLIANT ASTROPHYSICIST,

ALL OVER GOD'S CREATION

PUTTING OUT FIRES.

-LOOK, AUSTIN SHEPARD'S
A GENIUS.

I'M JUST LUCKY TO BE
CARRYING HIS WATER.

-THEY DON'T
DESERVE YOU, CHRIS.

WE COULD BE HAPPY

BACK IN THE STATES.

YOU COULD TEACH...

DO RESEARCH...

JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

-THIS, UH...

THIS ISN'T ABOUT
AUSTIN SHEPARD

OR THE SOLAR PROBE

OR ME BEING UNDER-APPRECIATED.

IS IT?

-ALL I WANT IS TO FEEL SAFE.

I JUST WANT US ALL TO FEEL SAFE.

-I WILL NEVER LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU...

OR HALEY.

NEVER.

OK?

-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

WHEN WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE,

YOU SAID THERE WOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM.

WE HAD AN APPOINTMENT FOR 2:00.

-I KNOW. I REMEMBER,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY,

BUT HE'S JUST NOT
ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

-WE MADE THIS APPOINTMENT
OVER A WEEK AGO.

IF I DON'T GET THIS INTO
EDITING BEFORE THE WEEKEND,

WE WON'T MAKE AIR.

-UH, WOULD YOU JUST

EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT?

HI. WELCOME BACK.

YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DR. SHEPARD
ANYWHERE, HAVE YOU?

IT'S JUST I'VE GOT
THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT
OF BARBARA WALTERS

HUFFING AND PUFFING
RIGHT THERE,

AND SHE'S REALLY
STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

-DR. RICHARDSON?

LAURIE STEPHENSON.

CHANNEL 7?

I COVERED YOUR SOLAR PROBE
NEWS CONFERENCE LAST MONTH.

HOW ARE YOU?
-UH, JET LAGGED.

-WE'RE DOING A FEATURE

ON THE RECENT SUNSPOT ACTIVITY.

UH, DR. SHEPARD PROMISED
AN INTERVIEW AT 2:00,

AND IT'S NOW ALMOST
A QUARTER TO 3:00.

-WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN

TO HELP YOU FIND HIM.

EXCUSE ME.

-LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE MISPLACED

A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER.

-UM, SO WHAT DO I TELL

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN
DOWNSTAIRS?

-JUST TELL THEM TO COOL
THEIR HEELS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

MAYBE THEY'LL GET BORED,
GO HOME.

-OK.

-CHRISTOPHER...

GINNY SENT THE CALCULATIONS

OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
DISTURBANCES

ASSOCIATED WITH ASTEROID 460.

YOUR WORK IS FLAWLESS.

I WISH IT...WASN'T.

WE'VE ALL SPENT
SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES

PONDERING THE MYSTERIES
OF THE COSMOS,

BUT NONE OF US COULD SAY
WHAT WE WOULD DO

IF WE ONLY HAD ONE WEEK
LEFT TO LIVE.

BON VOYAGE.

-CHRIS, I NEED TO SEE YOU.

MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW.

-GOOD NEWS, CHRIS.

I'M ASSIGNING YOU TO
THE SOLAR PHYSICS CONFERENCE.

YOU'LL BE REPRESENTING US

AS LEAD SCIENTIST
ON THE SOLAR PROBE.

-UH, AUSTIN SHEPARD
IS LEAD SCIENTIST

ON THE SOLAR PROBE.

-DR. SHEPARD HAS DISAPPEARED.

-AND YOU ARE?

-SPECIAL AGENT DELGADO,

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
ORGANIZATION.

-LONG WAY FROM HOME.

-MY ASSOCIATES--
AGENT BOTT, AGENT MEANS.

-INTERNAL SECURITY BUREAU.

WE'RE COOPERATING
ON DR. SHEPARD'S CASE.

-WHAT CASE IS THAT?

-AUSTIN TOOK
AN UNSCHEDULED TRIP

OUT OF THE COUNTRY
THIS MORNING, CHRIS.

-ANY IDEA WHERE HE WENT?

-LOOKING FOR A GOOD CURRY?

HEH.

-UH...

LET'S SEE. UM...

HERE. THE EQUATOR.

-ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.

THEY THINK THAT AUSTIN
HAS BEEN SELLING

SOME OF THE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS

FOR SOLAR PROBE...

TO OTHER PARTIES.

-UH...AUSTIN?

-BEFORE DR. SHEPARD
LEFT THIS MORNING,

HE EMAILED 5 COLLEAGUES--

ALL ASTROPHYSICISTS,

NONE OF WHOM
HAS ANYTHING TO DO

WITH THE SOLAR PROBE PROJECT,

AND ALL OF WHOM
ARE SCHEDULED TO BE

AT THE SOLAR CONFERENCE
TOMORROW.

-HE EMAILED ME THIS MORNING.

-SAYING?

-NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

BUT HE WAS THANKING ME
FOR SOME INFORMATION

I COMPILED FOR HIM
REGARDING A PLANETESIMAL

HE WAS INTERESTED IN--

ASTEROID 460--

NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE SOLAR PROBE.

-DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
THE OTHER EMAILS WERE ABOUT?

-I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE SPOOKS.
YOU TELL ME.

-DR. SHEPARD'S MESSAGES
SELF-DESTRUCTED
AFTER BEING READ.

NO FOOTPRINT;
VERY SOPHISTICATED.

WE KNOW WHO THEY WERE SENT TO,
BUT NOT THEIR CONTENTS.

NOW, WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

-I HAVE NO IDEA.

-CHRIS, THEY NEED TO KNOW
WHAT WAS IN THOSE EMAILS.

-WELL, THEN THEY CAN ASK

WHOEVER RECEIVED THEM.

OH, I GET IT.

SO THIS IS WHY

I'M GOING
TO THE CONFERENCE?

-YOU'LL BE WIRED
WITH A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE.

NO ONE WILL KNOW.

-I WILL KNOW.

-DR. RICHARDSON,

IF DR. SHEPARD IS INNOCENT--

IF HE'S MERELY
OUT FOR A JOYRIDE

LOOKING FOR A GOOD CURRY--

FINE. NO HARM; NO FOUL.

BUT IF HE'S SHOPPING
SOLAR PROBE PROTOCOLS

TO PARTIES OUTSIDE
OF OUR CONSORTIUM,

THEN THAT IS A MATTER
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

-INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.

-LOOK AT THIS.

-THE SCIENTISTS
IN THAT CONFERENCE,

THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH

THAT COULD BENEFIT
ALL OF MANKIND.

I CAN'T WALK IN THERE
LIKE SOME SPY.

-THERE ISN'T A CHOICE
IN THIS, CHRIS.

YOU'RE LEAVING.

TONIGHT.

-COME WITH ME.

-TROUBLE IN EMERALD CITY.

-YOU SURE THIS THING CAN FLY?

-WE GO WITH GOD.

-I ONCE READ THE PENTAGON
STUCK A WHOLE SPY MODULE

IN THE HUBBLE WITHOUT
NASA EVER KNOWING.

I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
AT THE TIME.

-WHY WOULD THE N.I.O.
BE INTERESTED IN AUSTIN'S WORK?

UNLESS SOLAR PROBE
HAS SOME FUNCTION

WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ABOUT.

-BUT YOU'RE
THE PROJECT MANAGER.

YOU'D KNOW IF THERE WERE
ANY OTHER FUNCTIONS,

WOULDN'T YOU?

-WHATEVER AUSTIN
WAS WORKING ON,

ITS TWIN WOULD BE DOWN HERE.

-INTERNAL SYSTEMS OPS
CREATES A SHADOW FILE

OF EVERYTHING ENTERED
INTO THE SPL NETWORK.

-EVERYTHING?

-THIS IS ODD.
-WHAT?

I'M SCROLLING
ALL COMMUNICATION

BETWEEN DR. SHEPARD
AND ANY SCIENTIST,

EITHER ON OUR NETWORK
OR OUTSIDE OF IT...

-AND?

-I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UP UNTIL FIVE DAYS AGO.

AFTER THAT, THERE'S NOTHING.

-YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING
EVEN WEIRDER THAN THAT?

-WHAT?
-IT'S ALL GONE.

ALL OF IT.

ALL OF HIS NOTES,

EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE SOLAR PROBE,

ALL THE DATA I SENT HIM
REGARDING THE PLANETESIMAL.

EVERYTHING FROM
THE LAST FEW DAYS IS GONE.

-WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

-AUSTIN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

-NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE TIME.

-YES.

-IT'S STARTED.

Woman on TV: AUTHORITIES
HAVE NO EXPLANATION

FOR THIS TRAGIC
ANIMAL BEHAVIOR,

BUT SCIENTISTS
AT THE INTERNATIONAL
WILDLIFE FEDERATION

CONTINUE TO INSIST

THAT THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN THE INSTANCE HERE

AND THE SPONTANEOUS
ZEBRA STAMPEDE

WHICH KILLED 30 CHILDREN

IN A REMOTE KENYAN VILLAGE,

OR THE MASSIVE
LOCUST STORMS...

-PLEASE!

-HELP ME.

HELP ME.

-WHOA, I'M SORRY.

-NO, I'M SORRY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

-THERE'S A PROBLEM
AT THE LAB.

AUSTIN SHEPARD IS MISSING.

-MISSING?

-HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE SOLAR SYMPOSIUM,

AND NO ONE CAN FIND HIM,

SO I HAVE TO GO
IN HIS PLACE.

-WHEN?

YOU'RE GONNA MISS
HALEY'S RECITAL, AREN'T YOU?

-NO, NO. BROOKE, HONEY...

YOU CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS, OK?

YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE YOURSELF SICK.

-YOU DIDN'T SEE THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE, CHRISTOPHER.

HE ENJOYED WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE PEOPLE.

HE WAS EXCITED BY IT.

-YEAH, AND THANKS TO YOU,

HE IS NEVER GONNA HAVE
THE CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN.

-HE SAID HE WOULD
COME FOR US--FOR HALEY.

-[SIGHS]

HOW?

HE--YOU KNOW, HE'S IN JAIL.

THEY'VE GOT HIM LOCKED UP.

THEY'RE NEVER GONNA LET HIM GO.

TERESA'S HERE ALL THE TIME.

THERE'S A SECURITY SYSTEM THAT
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE POLICE.

I GOT THE GUYS FROM THE LAB--
THE SECURITY--

THEY DRIVE BY HERE ALL NIGHT.

YOU ARE SAFE.

HALEY'S SAFE.

-I WISH WE'D NEVER COME HERE.

[INMATES CHATTERING]

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

-PIG SLOP FOR A PIG.

HEH HEH!


-HE'S SCHEDULED TO SPEAK
AT THE SYMPOSIUM TOMORROW.

YEAH, HE SHOULD HAVE
CHECKED IN ALREADY.

REALLY?

I'M TOLD THAT THE UNIVERSITY
USES YOUR HOTEL EXCLUSIVELY

FOR VISITING PROFESSORS
AND GUEST SPEAKERS.

AND YOU'RE CERTAIN
DR. AUSTIN SHEPARD

HASN'T CHECKED IN?

OKAY. THANKS.

-WORKING LATE?

-HARRY, HOW ARE YOU?

-OH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

HOW'S THE SUNSPOT THING
GOING?

-IT'S GOING.

-DON'T MAKE A MEAL
OUT OF IT.

YOU'RE NOT IN BOSNIA ANYMORE.

IT'S FILLER. FLUFF. OKAY?

-YEAH. RIGHT.

-ON TUESDAY I WANT YOU
TO COVER THAT

PUPPY ADOPTION THING
AT THE NURSING HOME.

-YOU SAID YOU'D PUT ME
ON THE COLE EXECUTION.

-OH, SORRY. I GAVE THAT
TO KIM HADENFIELD.

I THOUGHT SHE'D BE MORE--
-HOT.

-SENSITIVE.

I'M SENDING CARR WITH HER.

YOU CAN TAKE THE NEW KID
TO THE NURSING HOME.

-PUPPIES. RIGHT.
I'M ON IT, CHIEF.

-YOU'RE NOT IN THE NETWORK
ANYMORE, KIDDO. REMEMBER THAT.

Television:
CONVICTED RAPIST
AND SERIAL KILLER GRANT COLE

WILL BE TRANSFERRED
FROM STATE PRISON

TO THE FACILITY IN BROWNSTOWN
WHERE HIS EXECUTION

IS SCHEDULED
TO BE CARRIED OUT.

COLE'S ATTORNEYS HAVE
CONTINUED TO FILE MOTIONS

FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION.

BUT THOSE APPEALS--

Haley: MOM!

COME ON, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

-GO GET IN THE CAR, HONEY.

I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

-NEXT TIME YOU GO
PLAYING IN THE ALLEY, SOPHIA,

YOU HAVE TO WEAR
YOUR SNEAKERS, OKAY?

P.A.: DR. LURIE,
CALL 2137.

-HELLO, DOCTOR.

-WELL DONE.

-SO, YOU DOING
ANYTHING TONIGHT?

-WHAT IS THIS?

-OUR ANNIVERSARY.

ONE YEAR TO THE DAY

SINCE THE FIRST TIME
I KISSED YOU.

-OH, GOD. I TOTALLY FORGOT.

I'M SO SORRY.

[THUD,
ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]

-MARY ANN, WHAT HAPPENED?

-EVERYTHING'S JUST
STARTED GOING CRAZY.

HEAVY EQUIPMENT SHUT DOWN,
EVERYTHING.

POWER'S OUT ALL AT ONCE.

-WE'VE GOT SEVERE
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS HERE!

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

-BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

THIS BABY HAS A 6 MILLIMETER
WIDE-ANGLE LENS IN IT.

THE MIC IS MULTIDIRECTIONAL.

JUST TALK NORMALLY,

AND WE'LL
SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING.

OH, BY THE WAY,

IT ALSO WORKS JUST LIKE A PEN.

-GREAT.

-YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

-NOT IN YOUR WORLD, MAYBE.

-I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW GOOD SHE'S GOTTEN.

-SHE'S SO PROUD YOU CAME.

-I WOULDN'T HAVE
MISSED IT FOR THE WORLD.

-BINGO.

DR. SHEPARD?

[GLASS SHATTERS]

DR. SHEPARD?

THIS IS DR. AUSTIN SHEPARD'S
RESIDENCE

AT 273 OLD WILLOW ROAD,

AND IT'S ABOUT 9:30 P.M.,

AUGUST 29.

AS WE CAN SEE,

SOMEBODY'S BEEN IN HERE

LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

AND AS ECCENTRIC

AS DR. SHEPARD IS KNOWN TO BE,

IT'S A GOOD BET

HE WOULDN'T TRASH
HIS OWN HOME LIKE THIS.

SO FAR,

THERE'S NO SIGN...

OF ANY FOUL PLAY.

BUT THEN AGAIN,

THERE'S NO SIGN
OF DR. SHEPARD EITHER.




-AAH!

OH, GOD!


-GINNY.

LAURIE STEPHENSON,
CHANNEL 7.

-HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I LIVE?

-I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME.

[ELEVATOR DINGS]

-YEAH. I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

-GINNY, I THINK
DR. SHEPARD'S IN TROUBLE.

-SKIPPER.

-SKIPPER?

-THAT'S WHAT DR. SHEPARD
CALLED THE PORCUPINE.

HE USE TO HANG OUT ON
THE BACK PORCH ALL THE TIME.

-WHEN DID YOU
LAST SEE DR. SHEPARD?

-WELL, I SAW HIM THIS MORNING.

AT LEAST,
I SAW HIM ON THE PHONE.

THERE'S A T1 LINE DIRECT
FROM THE OBSERVATORY TO S.P.L.

-HAS ANYONE BEEN OUT THERE?

-NOBODY GOES OVER THERE

WITHOUT A PERSONAL INVITATION
FROM DR. SHEPARD.

-YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA

WHERE HE IS, DO YOU?

AND FROM THE LOOKS OF HIS PLACE,

YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
LOOKING FOR HIM.

DOESN'T THAT CONCERN YOU?

WE SHOULD GO OUT

TO HIS OBSERVATORY, GINNY.

WE SHOULD GO OUT THERE
AND CHECK ON HIM.

WHAT IF HE'S HURT?

I'M GOING OUT THERE.

-YOU KNOW,
IT'S A 4-HOUR DRIVE.

-SO?

-WELL, YOU'LL NEVER
GET PAST SECURITY.

A MAGNETIC STORM THAT
ORIGINATED FROM THE SUN

GAVE PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE
A RARE TREAT LAST NIGHT,

AND GAVE CELL PHONE PROVIDERS

AND SATELLITE CHANNELS
LIKE OURS HEADACHES.

RESEARCHERS FROM
LEADING UNIVERSITIES

WERE BOTH AWED
AND CAUGHT OFF-GUARD

BY THE LENGTH AND SIZE
OF THIS LATEST MAGNETIC STORM.

AS ONE RESEARCHER SAID,

"IT REINFORCES HOW LITTLE
WE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT OUR SUN."

BUT OUTSIDE OF SOME
MINOR INCONVENIENCES
LAST NIGHT,

SCIENTISTS TELL US TO EXPECT
THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS

THE MAGNETIC STORMS
WILL GRADUALLY SUBSIDE.

-Female News Announcer:
SCIENTISTS ARE NOW SAYING

A SERIES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC
PULSES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE HAVOC EXPERIENCED
IN TELEPHONE, TELEVISION,

AND RADIO TRANSMISSION ALL
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

THE INSTITUTE FOR
ATMOSPHERIC ANALYSIS

BLAMES THE PULSES
ON A NORMAL APEX

OF AN 11-YEAR CYCLE
OF SUNSPOT ACTIVITY...

-WE'RE JUST PICKING UP
SOME PAPERS FOR DR. SHEPARD.

-Man: SURE. DRIVE ON.
BYE, GINNY.

-FROM OCTOBER
TO NOVEMBER 2003,

MORE THAN A DOZEN SOLAR STORMS,

INCLUDING THE MOST POWERFUL
EVER RECORDED,

ERUPTED FROM
THE FACE OF THE SUN,

SENDING BLAST WAVES
IN EVERY DIRECTION.

ERUPTIONS SO POWERFUL

THAT BILLIONS OF TONS
OF ELECTRIFIED GAS

AT SPEEDS OF UP TO
5 MILLION MILES PER HOUR

SHOT INTO SPACE--

THE FASTEST EVER RECORDED.

FORTUNATELY, THESE BLASTS

WERE NOT AIMED
DIRECTLY AT EARTH.

Man: AUSTIN WOULDN'T
SEND OUT SUCH AN EMAIL

IF HE WASN'T SURE.

Second Man: IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

SOMETHING IS WRONG.

First Man: WELL, YOU'VE SEEN
THE EQUATIONS.

NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

-LOOK...

JUST BECAUSE WE ARE
UNABLE TO FIND ERROR

IN HIS CALCULATIONS

DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN

HIS CONCLUSION IS CORRECT.

THERE IS MISTAKE.

THERE IS SOMETHING
WE DO NOT SEE.

-YOU ARE IN DENIAL, MY FRIEND.

-GENTLEMEN...

AND LADY.

-DR. RICHARDSON.

WE WERE NOT EXPECTING YOU
TO ATTEND.

-DR. RICHARDSON,

WHERE IS DR. SHEPARD?

-AUSTIN HAS, UH, BEEN DELAYED.

-DELAYED?


THERE'S TOO MUCH COINCIDENCE.

SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

[RADIO STATIC]

-IT'S GARBAGE
ON THIS BANDWIDTH.

-AH, COME ON.

LET'S GET IT TOGETHER, GUYS.

-I'M SORRY.

THOSE SUNSPOTS
ARE AFFECTING OUR EQUIPMENT.

WAIT A SECOND.

THEY'RE ON THE MOVE.

-SERGEANT, ISN'T THERE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO

ABOUT ALL THIS INTERFERENCE
WE'RE GETTING?

-NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.
YOU KNOW, I SUGGEST

YOU GET ALL YOUR PEOPLE
ON HARD LINES.

ANYTHING OVER SATELLITE'S
IFFY AT BEST.

THAT LAST MAGNETIC STORM

KNOCKED OUT 2 D.O.D.
COMMUNICATION BIRDS

AND ABOUT 50%
OF THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITES
THAT ARE UP THERE.

-REALLY?

-OH, YEAH.

JOINT CHIEFS HAVE ORDERED

THAT WHATEVER SATELLITES WE HAVE
THAT CAN STILL BE MOVED

BE PUT INTO
A GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT.

WE'RE GONNA HIDE THEM
BEHIND THE PLANET,

TRY TO PROTECT THEM
FROM ANY MORE DIRECT HITS
LIKE WE HAD LAST NIGHT.

LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING

WE GOT FROM S.P.L.

WHATEVER MAGNETIC WAVES

AREN'T ABSORBED BY THE EARTH

JUST KIND OF FLOW AROUND IT.

ENVELOP IT LIKE A BLANKET.

YOU KNOW, THEY LOSE
SOME OF THEIR JUICE,

BUT A REALLY BIG ONE'S
GONNA KNOCK OUT
EVERYTHING ANYWAY.

Woman: JOSEPH, PLEASE.

ARE WE NOT BEING
A LITTLE PARANOID?

-MAYBE.

MAYBE NOT.

OK.

WHERE'S OUR GOOD FRIEND AUSTIN?

-AUSTIN'S MISSING.

-I THINK HE'S MISSING

LIKE IBRAHIM, YES?

-WHAT ABOUT IBRAHIM?

-SUICIDE.

AT LEAST, THAT IS

WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD.

-THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

JUST LIKE OLD SOVIET UNION.

S.S.S.R.

EVERY DEATH OF SCIENTIST--

SUICIDE.

-UH, JOSEPH,
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,

THAT--THAT HE WAS MURDERED?

-FIRST IBRAHIM.

NOW AUSTIN.

IT IS SAME OLD STORY--

K.G.B., C.I.A., N.I.O.

THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

THEY ONLY WANT CONTROL.

-BUT WHY IBRAHIM?

WH-WHY WOULD THEY
WANT TO HURT HIM?

-BECAUSE OF WHAT AUSTIN
TOLD HIM.

-BECAUSE OF WHAT AUSTIN
TOLD ALL OF US.

-WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

-YOU BETTER SIT DOWN, MATE.

-DR. SHEPARD'S PLAN
FOR A SOLAR PROBE

WAS TO INVESTIGATE
THE SUN'S CORE GRAVITY.

THIS ALGORITHM HERE
IS A FORMULA

FOR HYDROGEN
CONVERSION TO HELIUM
BY NUCLEAR FUSION.

-SURE, THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN MY GUESS.

-IT'S THE PROCESS
AT THE SUN'S CORE

THAT CREATES THE HEAT.

NOW, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD.

WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND

IS HOW THAT...

RELATES TO THIS...

WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE

SOME SORT OF BREACH
IN THE CORONA,

THROUGH THE PHOTOSPHERE--

-AND INTO THE CHROMOSPHERE.

-HMM.

WHAT CAUSED THE BREACH?

-WELL, WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE,

BUT AUSTIN HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT

THAT THE SUN IS FAR OLDER

THAN WE'VE IMAGINED.

-THAT'S JUST A HYPOTHESIS.

THE SOLAR PROBE WAS BUILT

TO EXPLORE THAT ASSUMPTION.

-SAVE THE ROCKET FUEL,
CHRISTOPHER. IT IS SETTLED.

-I AM NOT CONVINCED.

-IF AUSTIN IS RIGHT--

-AND WE'VE BEEN WRONG
ABOUT THE AGE OF THE SUN,

SO WHAT?

-IF I'M READING THIS
CORRECTLY,

AUSTIN'S CONVINCED

THAT THIS BREACH

IS JUST THE BEGINNINGS
OF A PROCESS

THAT WILL RESULT IN--

-A SUPERNOVA.

-OUI.

THE END OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

-BUT OUR ESTEEMED
COLLEAGUE JOSEPH

DOESN'T SEEM TO AGREE

WITH AUSTIN'S CALCULATIONS.

-THERE IS TOO MUCH
WE DO NOT KNOW

ABOUT STAR MATURITY
AND DEATH.

[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

LOOK.

LOOK RIGHT HERE.

HE IS MAKING AN ASSUMPTION

ABOUT CORE GRAVITY.

WHERE'D HE GET THIS ASSUMPTION?

-THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH IT.

-THE ASSUMPTION
MUST BE CORRECT, JOSEPH.

EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS

IS HAPPENING--

INTERFERENCE
WITH COMMUNICATIONS,

ANOMALOUS ANIMAL BEHAVIOR.

-A BREAKDOWN
OF THE MAGNETOSPHERE.

-SOMETHING IS WRONG.

I FEEL IT.

-RIGHT OR WRONG,

WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO CONSIDER.

-WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL
THE PUBLIC?

-YOU TELL THE PUBLIC NOTHING.

MY NAME IS
SPECIAL AGENT DELGADO,

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
ORGANIZATION.

I MUST ASK YOU ALL
TO COME WITH ME NOW.

IN THE INTEREST OF SECURITY,

YOU WILL BE ESCORTED
TO A SECURE LOCATION

WHERE YOU WILL BE DEBRIEFED.

-ABOUT WHAT?
-DEBRIEFED?

-REPRESENTATIVES
FROM YOUR GOVERNMENTS

WILL BE AVAILABLE
TO DISCUSS
THE SITUATION WITH YOU.

-I HAVE NO INTEREST

IN GOING TO A SECURE LOCATION.

-I SECOND THAT.

-I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT
A MATTER OF CHOICE.

DR. RICHARDSON,

PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN

THE SERIOUSNESS
OF OUR INTENTIONS.

-THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT
STOLEN PROTOCOLS, WAS IT?

-UNH!

OOF!

-HE'S GETTING AWAY!

-GET HIM.

-STOP!


-STOP!

-DR. CHENISLAV.

-DR. CHENISLAV.

WE'RE HERE
TO HELP YOU, SIR.

I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET...

BUT PLEASE STAY CALM.

LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

-NO! NO!

-AAH!

UNH! AAH! AAH!

[CHENISLAV GROANING]

-DELGADO!

DELGADO, NO!

-UNH!
-DAMN IT!

-HANG ON.

-HOLD ON!

-UHH, HOLD ON.

-UHH!

-HOLD ON!

-AAH!


-TAKE THE OTHERS
TO THE VAN.

-YES, MA'AM.

-I WANT
DR. SHEPARD'S NUMBERS

PUT THROUGH A RINGER.

I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK

THESE CALCULATIONS MEAN

AND WHETHER YOU AGREE
WITH HIS CONCLUSIONS.

NO ASSUMPTIONS, PEOPLE.

NO DRESSING THINGS UP.

NOBODY EATS.
NOBODY SLEEPS.

I WANT THE WORST-CASE
SCENARIO.

LET'S HOPE
THERE'S A FLAW.

-HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO TAKE?

-AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

-WE HAVE TO GET THIS OUT.

-GET WHAT OUT?

-EXCUSE ME, SIR.

I REALIZE I'M JUST
A CIVILIAN HERE,

BUT I THINK THE POTENTIAL
END OF THE WORLD

IS IMPORTANT NEWS.

-POTENTIAL? POTENTIAL?

WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

-GINNY SEEMS
FAIRLY CERTAIN.

-WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
3 MONTHS AGO,

GINNY WAS CLEANING OUT
HER DORM ROOM.

NO OFFENSE.

IF I WERE IN YOUR POSITION,
MISS STEPHENSON,

I'D WAIT UNTIL THERE'S A BIT
MORE INFORMED ANALYSIS

BEFORE MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF

AND RISKING WHAT'S LEFT
OF MY CAREER.

-LAURIE.

I'M SORRY. THAT WAS
CRUEL AND UNCALLED FOR.

-I'M USED TO IT.

BESIDES, YOU MAY BE ONLY
THREE MONTHS OUT OF YOUR DORM,

BUT I BET YOU KNOW MORE THAN
ALL THOSE WONKS PUT TOGETHER.

-SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

-WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
-I...

I KNOW WHAT I'D DO.

I'D GO FIND THAT
GORGEOUS BOYFRIEND YOU LOVE

AND SPEND EVERY POSSIBLE
SECOND IN HIS ARMS.

Man: YOU'VE GOT GREAT VEINS,
SO IT'S EASY TO HOOK YOU UP.

THE NEEDLE GOES IN
REALLY SLOWLY.

THAT'S WHEN THE WARDEN SIGNALS
FOR THE CURTAINS TO BE OPENED,

SO YOU CAN SEE ALL YOUR GUESTS
STARING AT YOU,

STRAPPED IN LIKE AN ANIMAL.

AND YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING,
HEAR EVERYTHING,

FEEL EVERYTHING.

BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE.

BUT THE BEST PART IS THE STUFF
THAT STOPS YOUR HEART...

NICE AND SLOW.

YOU CAN FEEL EVERY
LAST DROP OF BLOOD

DRAINING FROM YOUR BRAIN.

AND GUESS WHAT?

YOU'RE AWAKE.

-"SHE WAS THE BEST HORSE
I COULD EVER IMAGINE.

"HER MASTER CALLED HER 'SWEET,'
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS.

"EVERY TIME SHE SAW HIM
SHE WOULD NEIGH AND PRANCE

"UNTIL FINALLY
HE'D COME AND STROKE HER.

"AND THEN HE WOULD
LOOK DOWN ON ME AND SAY,

'LUCKY BOY,
YOU ARE BLACK SPOT
TO HAVE A MOM LIKE THIS.'"

-I HAVE EVERYONE
FROM THE JOINT CHIEFS

TO THE PRESIDENT'S
CHIEF OF STAFF

BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

I WANT THOSE PEOPLE
SECURED AND DEBRIEFED

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

-I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

WE'LL BE EN ROUTE
WITHIN THE HOUR.

SIR?

YOU'RE BREAKING UP, SIR.

-I'M IN THE AIR IN 15.

BE READY WHEN I GET THERE.

LET'S GO.

-HEY, WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

YOU CAN'T BE
TREATING US THIS WAY.

-THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT
IS NOT GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY
ABOUT THIS.

-AND YOU STILL
HAVE NOT TOLD US

WHAT HAPPENED TO JOSEPH.

-YOU WILL BE BRIEFED WHEN WE
ARRIVE AT OUR LOCATION.

-DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

-ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS THAT YOU'RE SECURE

FOR YOUR DEBRIEFING.

THAT IS MY JOB, THAT IS
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

-WHERE DO YOU
INTEND TO DO THIS?

-THIS WILL ALL
GO A LOT EASIER

IF YOU JUST COOPERATE.

-WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY?

I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL,
LET THEM KNOW I'M ALL RIGHT.

-THAT GOES FOR ALL OF US.
-WHEN WE GET TO THE LOCATION.

-COULD YOU AT LEAST
TAKE THE HANDCUFFS OFF?

-WE'LL APPROACH THE BIRD
FROM THE SIDE!

COME ON! COME ON!

UP! UP!

GO ALL THE WAY
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

STRAP IN.

WE'RE GOOD.


[PEOPLE SCREAMING]

[CARS HONKING]

[SIRENS BLARING]

[HELICOPTER APPROACHING]

-DO YOU REALLY THINK

THESE ARE NECESSARY
AT THIS POINT?

IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GOING ANYWHERE.

-THIS IS 3 DRAGON.

GAME BALL E.T.A.

APPROXIMATELY 2300 HOURS.


-HAVE WE GOT A BAD ROTOR?

-SOMETHING
WITH THE ELECTRONICS.

EVERYTHING'S OVERLOADED
AT THE SAME TIME.

-WHAT'S HAPPENING?

-IT'S THE AVIONICS.

STAND ON THE PEDAL.

-I'M ADJUSTING PITCH.

-STAND BY TO AUTO ROTATE.

[ALARM BUZZING]

-WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

-WE HAVE INSTRUMENT FAILURE.
I'VE GOT TO PUT US DOWN.

STRAP IN.

-GIVE ME A 3-PACK READ.


-NEGATIVE. IT'S GONE.

-SWITCH TO THE OMEGA.

-DISREGARD THE FLARE.

WE'LL BRING HER IN VISUALLY.

-HOLD ON!

-IT'S THE NAVIGATION,
ISN'T IT?

-IT'S THE RADIATION.

-PHOENIX 3, DRAGON.

WE'RE GOING DOWN.

WE'RE OK, WE'RE OK.

STAY ON THIS HEADING.
THERE'S A HIGHWAY, 2 CLICKS.

PHOENIX 3, THIS IS DRAGON.

WE HAVE FULL-SCALE
ELECTRONIC OVERLOAD

IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS.

MAYDAY, MAYDAY.
WE ARE GOING DOWN.

AT SOUTH 1-2-4 DEGREES,

3-3 MINUTES, 2-5 SECONDS,

EAST, 8-0 DEGREES,

2-0 MINUTES, 1-5 SECONDS.

-I DON'T SEE IT.

THERE'S NO HIGHWAY.

-IT SHOULD BE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

-AAH! WE'RE
GETTING CLOSER.

-WE'RE GOING IN HARD.
HANG ON!


-AAH!

-KILL THE ELECTRONICS.

-IT'S STILL MOVING!

-SHUT HER DOWN.
-HANG ON!



-WHAT'VE WE GOT?

-LAST MAGNETIC STORM
TOOK OUT AIR TRAFFIC

AND COMPUTERIZED
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
WORLDWIDE.

-OK, HOW DO WE AVOID THIS

FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?

-YOU GOT TO GROUND
ALL AIR TRAFFIC WORLDWIDE

UNTIL THE MAGNITUDE
OF THIS STORM SUBSIDES.

-THAT WOULD STRAND
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

IN TIMES OF
AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS.

-WE HAVE NO CHOICE,
DEPUTY MILLER.

-OK, GENTLEMEN,
COME WITH ME.

-I NEED THE DEPUTY CHIEF
OF THE SECRET SERVICE.

THIS IS MILLER.
9-1-6 APPLE DELTA.

I AM ACTIVATING

NATIONAL CRISIS
MANAGEMENT PLAN ZULU,

AND THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS STAFF

NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THIS,

AND ARRANGEMENTS
TO SECURE THEM

WILL NEED TO BE
SET IN MOTION.

YES.

CODE PHOENIX.

NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

RIGHT.

-INFORM THE SERGEANT
OF THE GUARD

THAT THIS FACILITY
IS TO BE LOCKED DOWN
WITHIN THE HOUR.

ALL PERSONNEL
WITHIN EASY TRANSIT
ARE TO BE RECALLED.

EVERYONE ELSE
IS TO BE IGNORED.

HAVE YOUR M.P.s
FULLY ARMED

WITH ORDERS
AFTER THE HOUR MARK

TO DENY ACCESS
TO ANYONE ELSE.

WORDS, WARNING SHOTS...

THEN THEY MUST DO
WHAT THEY MUST.

-YES, SIR.

-SHEPARD'S PREDICTIONS

FOR PHASE ONE AND PHASE 2

ARE BY AND LARGE CORRECT,

AND WE BELIEVE THAT PHASE 3

HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

WE'RE RECORDING CORONAL
MASS ERUPTIONS

UNLIKE ANYTHING
WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

-PLASMA FLARES
FROM THESE ERUPTIONS

ARE MOVING AT 4, 5,

6 MILLION MILES AN HOUR.

THAT PUTS FIRST IMPACT

AT 12 TO 15 HOURS.

-WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THEY HIT?

Handey on telephone:
CAN'T BE SURE.

ALL I HAVE TO GO ON ARE
THE COMPUTER SCENARIOS.

-LET'S HEAR 'EM.

-WE'LL BE BOMBARDED

WITH SUPER-HEATED
C.M.E. MATERIAL.

-ENGLISH, PLEASE.

-THINK FIRE BALLS,
I SUPPOSE.

-IN OTHER WORDS...

-THEY'LL BURN THEMSELVES
OUT BEFORE IMPACT.

-HELL, THAT'S A POSITIVE.

-YES, BUT...

WE ARE IN UNCHARTED

TERRITORY HERE, COLONEL.

THERE IS ALSO
THE POSSIBILITY...

THAT THE PLASMA
WILL ACTUALLY FEED

ON THE OXYGEN
IN OUR ATMOSPHERE.

TO PUT IT BLUNTLY,

THE SKY COULD CATCH FIRE.

COLONEL,

I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT.

I'D LIKE TO PREPARE
MY PEOPLE.

GET THEM READY TO LEAVE.

-JUST SIT TIGHT, HANDEY.

MAKE SURE NO ONE LEAVES.

YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM US.

[ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING]

-ANOTHER?

-YOU MAKE
A REALLY GOOD DRINK.

-WELL, YOU MAKE
A REALLY GOOD DRUNK.

-THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

-I'VE GOT A SECRET, YOU KNOW.

-I NEVER WOULD'VE GUESSED.

-WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.

-NO BIG SECRET THERE.

-NO, NO, NO, NO.

EVERYBODY.

SOON.

-IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT'S COMING NEXT.

ONLY MATTERS WHAT
YOU'RE DOING NOW.

L'CHAIM.

-DENVER INTERNATIONAL 747

OVERSHOT THE RUNWAY
BY 1,200 YARDS.

PILOT MANAGED
TO PUT IT DOWN
ON CATTLE PASTURE.

INSTRUMENT MALFUNCTION.

PEKING, SAME THING,

ONLY THEY WEREN'T SO LUCKY.

217 DEAD.

ALSO PITTSBURGH,
BOMBAY, MOROCCO,

PLUS THE THING IN PARIS,
THE TOKYO BLACKOUT...

IT'S WORLDWIDE.

-EXCUSE ME.

-NOTHING?

-NOT AT THOSE
COORDINATES, SIR.

-HOW LONG
SINCE THE MAYDAY?

-8 HOURS, SIR.

-WIDEN THE SEARCH.

I WANT SURVIVORS.

OR BODIES.

-TAKE IT EASY.

-AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
NOTHING'S BROKEN,

BUT I'D STILL GO SLOW
IF I WERE YOU.

-UNH.

-LIKE I SAID...

-MM.

-WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

[CELL PHONE BEEPS]

-DIDN'T MAKE IT.

-DID YOU PULL ME OUT?

-YEAH.


-THANK YOU.

-LET'S HOPE
THEY CAN FIND MY SIGNAL.

-I GOTTA GET HOME.

-UH--

-UNH.

-SIT DOWN, RICHARDSON.

-LOOK, MY WIFE
AND DAUGHTER ARE ALONE.

THEY NEED ME.

THERE'S GOT TO BE A TOWN

AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

UHH.

-CHRISTOPHER.
[COCKS GUN]

-MY ORDERS STILL STAND.

-LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

YOU GOT A HUSBAND? KIDS?

-I DIDN'T THINK SO.

-SINCE YOU ASKED,
I HAVE A MOTHER
AND A SISTER.

-DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE THEM AGAIN?

-I INTEND TO.

-THEN LISTEN
VERY CLOSELY

TO WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO TELL YOU

BECAUSE IN
A VERY SHORT TIME--

WEEKS, MAYBE MONTHS--

THIS ENTIRE PLANET
IS GONNA START TO BOIL

LIKE AN EGG IN HOT WATER.

THAT'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE YOU MUCH TIME

FOR A FAMILY REUNION, IS IT?

-YOU COULD BE WRONG...

RIGHT?

-LET'S PUT IT
THIS WAY--

I DON'T THINK
YOUR ORDERS

ARE GONNA MATTER ANYMORE.

[HELICOPTER APPROACHING]

-ORNITHOLOGISTS BELIEVE

THE DUCKS MIGRATE USING
ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERNS

IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

BUT THOSE PATTERNS HAVE
APPARENTLY BEEN DISRUPTED.

IN FACT,
ERRATIC MIGRATING BEHAVIOR

HAS BEEN REPORTED
ALL OVER THE CONTINENT.

THE CAUSE? SUNSPOTS.

-THIS SUNSPOT ACTIVITY

HAS SURPASSED ALL RECORDED
HISTORICAL LEVELS,

CAUSING COMMUNICATIONS
BLACK-OUTS,

FREAKISH ELECTRICAL STORMS,

AND EVEN THE RECENT
AIR DISASTERS

WE'VE BEEN SEEING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

AND AROUND THE WORLD.

ACCORDING TO
RENOWNED ASTROPHYSICIST
DR. AUSTIN SHEPARD

OF THE SPACE PROPULSION
LABORATORIES,

WE'RE IN FOR A LOT WORSE.

HE'S NOT ONLY PREDICTED
RECENT EVENTS CORRECTLY,

BUT HIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS

THAT EVENTS ARE BUILDING
TOWARDS A POSSIBLE...

CATACLYSMIC SUPERNOVA
OF THE SUN.

-WHAT THE HELL?

-THANKS, LAURIE.

WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY
TONIGHT AT 11:00.

-DON'T GO AWAY.
TONY SUMMERS HAS HIS REVIEW

OF THE VICTORIA'S SECRET
LINGERIE SHOW....NEXT.

Man: AND WE'RE CLEAR.

-ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
-I WISH I WAS.

YOU HAVE NO CORROBORATION,
NO VERIFICATION.

-WOULD YOU HAVE
AIRED IT IF I HAD?

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

-THIS ONE GOES DOWN
TO RADIOLOGY.

DON'T LET HIM GET LOST IN
THE SHUFFLE DOWN THERE, G.

AND G, STAY WITH HIM.

-HEY.
-HEY.

WHAT HAPPENED?

-A COMMUTER JET LOST
ITS NAVIGATION SYSTEMS.

AND CRASHED INTO A HOTEL
NEAR THE AIRPORT.

METROPOLITAN CAN'T HANDLE
THE CASUALTIES.

THEY'RE SENDING THE REST HERE.

-LOOK...
WE NEED TO TALK.

IT'S ALL HAPPENING--
I MEAN, EVERYTHING HE PREDICTED.

PLANE CRASHES, EVERYTHING.
IT'S ALL HAPPENING.

-WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

WILL IT BE SOON?

-I DON'T KNOW.

I'M SO SORRY.

-I'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY ROOM
FULL OF PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO NEED ME.

AND, UH...

UNTIL IT'S MY TIME...

THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA BE.

-OK, GO.

WE ARE LIVE AT THE GATES
OF THE FEDERAL PRISON

AT PRAETORIA,

WHERE CONVICTED SERIAL
KILLER GRANT COLE

IS BEING TRANSFERRED...

-THEY SAY
HE NEVER CHECKED IN.

YEAH, I'VE CALLED
THE CONFERENCE CENTER.

HE WAS REGISTERED.

PEOPLE SAW HIM THERE.

LOOK, I WANT TO SPEAK
WITH JOE HANDEY.

OK, WELL, WHAT ABOUT
GINNY McKILLOP?

HELLO?

[TELEPHONE BEEPS]

Reporter on TV:
NOW WE'RE GONNA
GO BACK TO THE STUDIO,

WHERE I BELIEVE
ROBERT IS LIVE.

ROBERT, DO WE HAVE
ANY UPDATES SO FAR?

-YES, WE DO...


-I'M SURE
HE'S ALL RIGHT, MOM.

-SURE HE IS, HONEY.

IT'S JUST THESE PHONES

AND THIS CRAZY
INTERFERENCE, RIGHT?

-HE'LL CALL IN,

LET US KNOW
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

I'M GONNA GO PRACTICE.

-GOOD GIRL.

MAJOR LUCAS, PLEASE SEE
A STAFF DUTY OFFICER.

[WOMAN ON P.A.
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

Man: SO HERE WE ARE
FLOUNDERING UNDERGROUND, EH?

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

[CHATTERING STOPS]

-DR. IBRAHIM.

I WAS TOLD
THAT YOU WERE DEAD.

-I THINK WE ARE
ALL DEAD, MY FRIEND.

-NOT YET.

-HARLAN WILLIAMS,
DR. RICHARDSON.

I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE SAFE.

-DELGADO.

-AHEM.

-HAVE A SEAT.

-I THINK I'LL STAND.

-YOU KNOW,
I THINK WE OWE YOU

A BIT OF AN EXPLANATION.

-YEAH, JUST A BIT.

-YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO WASTE TIME

WITH A LOT
OF INTRODUCTIONS.

SUFFICE TO SAY THAT
THESE MEN AND WOMEN

WERE GATHERED
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY

AND WITH GREAT EFFORT,
I MIGHT ADD,

TO EVALUATE
AUSTIN SHEPARD'S THEORIES

ABOUT THE CURRENT
UNANTICIPATED
SOLAR ACTIVITY.

-YOU MEAN THE END
OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

-WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD
SHED SOME NEW LIGHT

ON HIS CALCULATIONS.

-LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY,

EVEN IF AUSTIN'S CALCULATIONS

ARE PARTIALLY INCORRECT,

LIFE ON THIS PLANET

IS ABOUT TO CHANGE RADICALLY.

THE POLAR ICECAPS MAY MELT.

THE ATMOSPHERE
MAY BE STRIPPED AWAY.

IF THAT HAPPENS,
EXPOSURE TO U.V. ALONE
WILL KILL US.

MAKE NO MISTAKE--

A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT
WILL HAPPEN.

IT'S OUT OF OUR CONTROL,
PEOPLE.

WE NEED TO WARN THE PUBLIC.

MAYBE THROW UP A PRAYER.

-I DON'T PUT MUCH STOCK

IN BLIND FAITH,
DR. RICHARDSON.

FORTUNATELY, I'M NOT ALONE.

-IN THE EARLY FIFTIES,

SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE

IN SOME VERY IMPORTANT COUNTRIES

ASKED A VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION--

IF CIVILIZATION WAS FACED
WITH ANNIHILATION--

AND BY CIVILIZATION,
THEY MEANT US, CHRISTOPHER--

THE EDUCATED, THE SKILLED,
THE TRAINED.

IF SOMEHOW
WE FACED EXTINCTION,

COULD ANY SEMBLANCE
OF A CIVIL SOCIETY

BE REGENERATED?

AND THE ANSWER AT THE TIME
WAS QUITE CLEARLY...

NO.

-SO THE CONCEPT
OF PLAUSIBLE SURVIVABILITY

WAS DEVELOPED,
AND BACK IN THE FIFTIES,

THAT MEANT
CANNED FOOD, WATER,

AND MAYBE AN 8x10
CONCRETE CUBICLE.

AS YOU CAN SEE,

WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
SINCE THEN.

-PHOENIX--

ONE OF SEVERAL
SELF-SUSTAINING,

SELF-CONTAINED FACILITIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN
UP TO 10,000 PEOPLE

FOR UP TO 15 YEARS.

ENGINEERS, SCIENTISTS,
DOCTORS,

TEACHERS, FARMERS--
VERY EGALITARIAN.

THE LISTS ARE UPDATED
CONSTANTLY.

ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE,
CHRISTOPHER,

EXCEPT FOR LAWYERS, OF COURSE.

A NOAH'S ARK FOR
THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

EACH FACILITY HOUSES
A DNA LIBRARY

OF OVER 250,000 SPECIES

OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.

THIS ONE IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE LIVE MAINTENANCE
OF OVER 700.

IF ONLY 1/3 OF THESE
FACILITIES SURVIVE,

MANKIND COULD STILL EMERGE

WITH ENOUGH DNA,

ENOUGH GENETIC DIVERSITY,

TO SAFELY REPOPULATE
THE PLANET.

ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

-ASSUMING THERE'S
A PLANET LEFT TO,
UH, EMERGE TO.

-WELL, FRANKLY,

A SUPERNOVA WOULD DEFINITELY

OVERWHELM OUR PREPARATIONS.

WE'VE BEEN BETTING
ON SOMETHING A BIT
LESS APOCALYPTIC.

[ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS]

-NOWHERE ELSE TO GO BUT UP.

Woman on P.A.:
FUEL CONSERVATION PLAN
FOXTROT IS IN EFFECT.

PLEASE BE SURE YOUR SHIFT'S
IN COMPLIANCE.

-AUSTIN SHEPARD'S
PROJECTIONS ARE
ELABORATELY COMPLEX.

HELP US OUT HERE.

SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY FLAWS IN HIS WORK.

-WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD EVER AGREE

TO PARTICIPATE
IN THIS MADNESS?

-YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

EVER SINCE YOU TOOK
A JOB AT S.P.L.,

YOU'VE BEEN ON THE LIST.

-WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY?

-I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

-WHAT ABOUT YOU?

YOU ONE OF
THE LUCKY ONES, TOO?

-AGENT DELGADO HAS
THE NECESSARY SKILLS.

-WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,
YOUR SISTER?

THEY GOT
THE NECESSARY SKILLS?

YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

-LOOK AROUND YOU.
TRIGGER'S ALREADY BEEN PULLED.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY DIRECTIVE.

IT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS
FOR YEARS.

EVERY PRESIDENT,

WHETHER HE'S AWARE OF IT OR NOT,

IS BOUND BY IT.

THE SAME IS TRUE
IN AT LEAST 2 DOZEN
OTHER COUNTRIES.

-MARTIAL LAW.
-THINK OF IT AS THE DRAFT.

-WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER PEOPLE?

HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA REACT
WHEN THEY FIND OUT?

-WE DON'T ADVERTISE,
CHRISTOPHER.

-TELL ME THIS IS A BAD JOKE.

YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT CRAP.

-IT'S ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD.

THE HIVE...

AND THE SURVIVAL OF IT.

-DON'T BE FOOLISH,
CHRISTOPHER.

-UNH!

-HEY!

UNH! UNH!

-SIR, SIR, STOP!

-UHH!

-UNH! UHH!

-MOVE!

GET UP.

GO!

-MOVE IT, MOVE IT!

-STEP BACK.

-STOP!

[TIRES SCREECH]

-AAH!

AAH!

-WATCH OUT.

-AAH! UNH.

WAIT! STOP, STOP!

-CHRISTOPHER, STOP!

THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

STOP!

-HOLD THE VEHICLE!

[GUNS COCK]

-STEP AWAY FROM
THE VEHICLE, SIR.

-RIGHT.
-AAH!

UHH.

-HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING
THE RIDE, GUYS?

-IS THIS THE BEST
YOU CAN DO, HANDEY?

-AFTER THE LAST INCIDENT,

WE HAD TO REBOOT A COUPLE

OF RETIRED
COMMERCIAL SATELLITES.

THIS IS THE BEST GRAPHIC
WE COULD ACCOMPLISH

WITH THE DATA WE RECEIVED.

YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE SEEING THIS MUCH.

OLD SATELLITES PLUS
THIS KIND OF EVENT

ARE NOT A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS.

-HOLD YOUR BREATH.

-IMPACT IN...

5...

4...

3...

2...

1.

-WHAT THE HELL?

-YOU BELIEVE THIS?

-WE'RE GONNA LOSE IT!
HOLD IT.

-AAH! UNH.

AAH! AAH!


-WELL NOW,
ISN'T THIS SOMETHING?

YOU'RE ALIVE, TOO, HUH?

YEAH, WELL...

YEAH, TOUGH SITUATION HERE.

MAYBE, UH...

YOU CAN...

-[GURGLING]

-WELL, THAT'S A SOLUTION.


-YES. COME ON NOW.

AHH.

HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT, MATE.

YOU AND ME.

Inmate: SO, WHAT NOW?

SUPPOSE WE FIND
SOME TRANSPORTATION

SOON AS WE CAN NOW, RIGHT?

I MEAN,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE, YOU KNOW...

I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.

YOU'RE FAMOUS. I'VE HEARD
QUITE A LOT ABOUT YOU.

AND I TELL YA...

I--I CAN DO A FEW THINGS.
I CAN HOT-WIRE ANYTHING.

ANYTHING YOU TELL ME TO DO--
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU.

ALL RIGHT?
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

-WE'RE DOING WELL,
CONSIDERING THE TIME CRUNCH.

THE PHOENIX COMPOUND IS
READY TO BE INHABITED.

WE HAVE A LOCK
ON 40% OF OUR TARGETS,

WORKABLE WHEREABOUTS
ON AN ADDITIONAL 25.

EVEN IF WE TOP OUT AT THAT,
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

MY ADVICE: WE BEGIN
COLLECTING IMMEDIATELY.

-COLONEL!
-THE LONGER
WE'VE DODGED THE BULLET--

HOLD ON.

WILLIAMS.

-BETTER CHECK
YOUR MONITORS AGAIN.

-CAPTAIN?
MR. MILLER.

-WHAT IS THIS?
-IT'S A SOLAR PLASMA EJECTION.

S.B.L. SAYS
IT'S HEADED FOR EARTH.

-WHAT?
-SOLAR MATERIAL.
IT'S A FORM OF MATTER.

IT'S UNSTABLE. WE KNOW
VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.

-HOW MUCH TIME?
-MINUTES.

ARE THE PHOENIX COMPLEXES
IN THE U.S., EUROPE

AND AUSTRALIA AWARE OF THIS?

-YES, SIR, THEY ARE.

-SPACE COMMAND SATELLITES
OFF-LINE, SIR.

-WITHOUT KNOW WHERE OR WHEN,
WE CAN'T ORDER EVACUATIONS.

OH, GOD HELP US.
