[creepy organ music]

He walked in and started shooting.

Why does this happen?
It was an assault rifle.


it's the third this week.
He was shooting

people like they weren't real.

[Newswoman] 19 dead, 27 injured.
He died in my arms.

I thought I was dead.

[Newswoman] He even killed children.
It's a mental health issue.

This world is so messed up right now.

There were dead people everywhere.
[News Woman] I'm sorry, Robert...

there's just too many of these

mass shootings.

Back to you...

experts will discuss
the alarming amount of mass murders

in recent months,
and authorities have yet to determine

the motive of last week's

massacre in South Florida.

â™ª You are listening to the Halloween mix â™ª

[upbeat music]
How are you not seeing this?

Seeing what?

Look outside, there's no one out there.

True story.
[spooky doorbell ]

[John] About time.
Untrue story, spooky...

[Riley] Pizza's here!
[Stacy] Ooh, pizza!

You know what I'm saying, though?

Hi, thank you.
[Jack] Not really, I guess...


one kid who comes to the door.
One second...


No payment needed...

It's 30 minutes late.
[Jack] No one's really in the mood.


there's some weird shit going on.

Sweet.
[Luna] I know.

Have a good night!
[Brandon] Weird shit for weeks!


trick-or-treaters outside.

[Riley] Pizza's free!
[Brandon] What happened to fun,

like when we were kids? I mean...
[Riley] Come eat! Come eat!

when we all went trick-or-treating,

you know?
We're not kids anymore.

Yeah, I know
we're not kids anymore., man, but...

[Britney] Move, move....
I agree with Brandon.

Everything used to be more fun
back in the day.

[Brandon] Fuck yeah.
What day?

You know what I mean.

Now, things that are supposed to be fun
aren't even fun anymore.


Like movies...

They're all so damn serious.
Right?

I mean, look at this,

you can't even
tell what holiday it is.

Not true, we got a cake.
[Jack] It's Halloween!


It's not that good,
I've had better.

When did things change?
[Riley] Thanks mom!

When did people stop playing outside

and showing up to events?
[Riley] Uh, coronavirus?

When we got old.

Hey, speak for yourself!


in the real Eighties.

So I can still miss it, can't I?


had a feel to it.
[Britney] True.

The Eighties were the Eighties.

The Nineties were the Nineties.
[Britney] Love the Nineties.

But after the 2000s.

What? What era are we in now?

Cell phones, Facebook and Xanax.

This era sucks,
what the fuck happened?



[Britney] Hmm.
This.

â™ª [wolf howl] â™ª

I seriously can't believe this.

Why do people keep shooting people?

Like, what the fuck?

I hate guns.

I think they should be fucking banned.

[Britney] They should.
[Luna] Like, what are you going to do with an AK-47?

Its sole purpose is to kill people.

I mean, you can't just ban guns.

They have so many different uses

like sport and game.

[John] True.
[Luna] Game?

Really? An AK motherfucking 47,

its sole purpose is to kill human beings.

And don't tell me otherwise!

I wasn't specifically referring

to an AK-47, but okay...

Like, imagine...

actually killing someone...

Do you think
you could actually kill someone?

For real?

Like, imagine what it would take...

Imagine seeing someone's life
leave them in front of you

because of what you did...

It's fucked up, man.


I couldn't do it.

Yeah, neither could I.

Jack?

Whoa, don't ask me like a bullshit

loaded question like that.

No, I mean, seriously,
you can kill someone

with a butter knife.

I mean, honestly.
[Brandon] Butter knife?

If someone's coming at me, bro...

Come at me, bro.

[mouth gun click]

They're going to get dealt with.

[laughter]
Boom!

Oh!
[Luna] Seriously, guys!


You watch this shit on TV...

It's not "real." Dead body in a movie,

dead body in a street.


It changes when it's someone you know.

it has nothing to do with you

until it has something to do with you.

Stay asleep.

Do nothing.

Watch what happens to your life.


Happy Halloween.

[laughter]
What do you do about it, Monica, huh?

Alright, alright, you guys.

There's so much fucked up shit

that happens in the world
every day, right?


I mean, there's nothing
we can actually do about it

if you really honestly look at it.


That's why we have fucking police and shit.

Police are busy handling crime.

They're not...
[Riley] Handling crime?

feeding the poor
and picking up trash and shit.

[Riley] They're busy killing Black people.
Are we being real right now?

Because I can get real.

Oh boy...
[laughter]

It sounds fucked up, but

I have my own problems to worry about.

I can't feed bums on the street,

I can barely pay my own fucking rent.

[Brandon] Wow!
[Luna] Really? Really John.

That's true though!
[Riley] So true.

I'm not trying to be

an asshole or anything.

Tell me I'm the only one in the room

who thinks this?

Tell me.

Right?

I mean, shit, if I'm being really real.

There have been starving kids in Africa

since before I was born.

So like, if they're still starving,

they must not be really starving
or they'd be dead.

[Brandon] Dude!
[John] I'm just fucking saying.

[Monica] Oh my god...
[John] If the greatest minds haven't

been able to solve the problem
in all these years

what the fuck can I do?

[Luna] John!
[Riley] He's right!

[John] Think about it!
How am I supposed

to pick up all this trash on the beach?

[Britney] Yeah!
If people just keep putting it there.

I have a life. I won't be truly living

if all I'm doing is picking up trash.

Exactly, I hate donating blood.


Why kill myself for someone else?

Bet you'd kill yourself for me, right?

Fuck yeah, bitch, of course.

[laughter]
[Brandon] Come on.

All these problems in the world,

I live halfway across the planet,

I can't do jack shit.

See, that's why I want to be rich

so I can donate to things.

[Britney] Aw, you wanna' be rich.
I agree with Luna,

people come up with
new solutions all the time.

Yeah, while you two are getting rich,

people are going to die.

Why is the world so fucked up, though?

Has anyone actually thought about it?

Like, why would God do that?

It's the devil.

True story.
[Monica] It's not the fucking devil.

All right. What then?
[Brandon] Could be.

You have no idea
who runs the media and governments.

Oh fuck off.
[Riley] The governments?

Who do you think controls the news

telling you it's all bad?


And the economy?

Making us stressed, anxious and depressed

so they can sell us drugs

and make shit tons of money off?


Just saying Britney,

there is some fucked up,

sinister shit going on in this world

that no one talks about because they do...

[mouth click]

What shit?

Jack! Shh!

What?

You know, every mass shooter

was on some
sort of mind drug, right?

[Riley] What?
[John] Stop!

The news never talks about that.

Any celebrity they want to terminate...

Suicide... OD...

It's the new "natural" cause.

And they told me I had ADHD
when I was nine.

[John] Can't imagine why.
[Monica] Wanted to end my creativity.

Fuck you!

I was nine!

I'm supposed to be hyper at nine.

Okay. How do you even know all this?

I've researched a fuck ton online.

Oh, all that fake news,
conspiracy shit.

You need to know how
to do proper research.

It's right there.

Okay, show me.

Okay.

All right. All right.

You guys, please, no,

can we stop with the fucking conspiracy shit!

[chatter]
[Britney] Jack, come on!

[Brandon] Jack, dude!
[Britney] Please, you guys!

[laughter]
You guys?

The world is fucked, okay?

And we're not going to be able
to do jack shit about it.

So let's just enjoy our lives.

[Riley] Let's!
Okay? Right?

Why, I don't even...

Why the fuck are you watching this shit?


[Riley] Thank you!
Let's go do something fun.

Like what?

I don't know.

Brandon, what do we do as kids?

You're the one complaining. Ideas?

I don't know, I guess,
talk to each other more?

or play catch.
[Britney] Yeah, no, that's great!

[Jack] Spin the bottle.
[Luna] Play catch!

I talk to a lot of people now

more than ever on social media,
so I don't know what you're talking about.

[John] I can't do social media.
You know, I kind of lost touch

with all my friends on social.

I see everything they do, but...

When we talk, it's
kind of superficial. I guess...

[Riley] I don't think so.
[Monica] Another reason why

the world is so fucked.

Computers, phones, social media

making everyone fucking antisocial.
[Britney] Alright.

Alright!

Monica, come on.
[Riley] Get off then.

Knock it off!

Can we just fucking

look each other in the face

and fucking fact on each other?


I need some water.


Yes, but I'll always be yours.

[Jack] Go talk to her.
[John] Change your sexual preference.



Go!

Okay, ya'll, listen...

This is my fucking house.

And if I say we're talking to each other,

we're gonna' fucking talk to each other.

Monica!

Oh, Jesus!

to talk about?

[Brandon] Hey.
Hey.

[Jack] Let's talk about horror movies.
I don't know why I'm so thirsty.

Yeah, me too.

You know...

All that talk

in there made me realize something...

Oh yeah.

Yeah.


That we don't really talk enough...

What do you mean
we don't talk enough?

I guess I don't mean like

talk enough, I guess...

You know, talk about things that we really...

should talk about...

Well, what things
do you want to talk about?


[ear ringing]
[Riley] Yeah, kinda'...





You know, since your grandma, um...

things have been different...

Yeah, it's been um...

I know.

I'm sorry.

What? No, no, no, no.

Not with you. With me.

You know, she and I, she just...


It was the last time I saw her,
you know, and I, uh...

It's been hard for me to shake it.


What happened?

â™ª You are tuned in to DJ â™ª

What?
â™ª Devin Rice â™ª

â™ª You are listening to the Halloween Mix â™ª
[Luna] What?

you have to drink for it?

No, no, it's not, it's not. It's not.

It's not bad. It's...

Well?

Look, tell me you're freaking me out.

She just she saw me looking at you

when you weren't looking at me

and, um, she gave me this look.

She didn't say anything, but

I got the message.

...What?
â™ª Happy Halloween â™ª

Okay...

You're fucking with me.

Look,

what if I told you,

that I'm looking for...

a sign

that I should kiss you right now?

I would say that

I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship.

I'd say...

I don't care.

I'd say we can't.

I'm going to kiss you right now.

You wouldn't.

[ear ringing]

[gasps]
[tense music]

[floor thuds]

â™ª [evil laughter] â™ª

[door opening]


â™ª You are listening to the Halloween Mix â™ª

[suspenseful music]



[Stacy] Why are we on the floor?
[Britney] What the fuck is this?

[Riley] What happened?
[Monica] What the fuck?

What is this? Who did this?
Did one of you guys?

[Riley] Did one of us what?
[Jack] Ah, fuck...


[Britney] Why's a knife taped to my hand?
[Riley] Keep it on or die?

[Britney] Why do you have an axe?
[Riley] What the fuck is this?

[Riley] Mom?!
[Stacy] What the fuck. What is going on?

What's going on? What the fuck?

Mom?


How much did we
fucking drink last night?


[wooden bat hits ground]

[ear ringing]

[John screams]
[others panicking]

[Luna] John, what's happening!
[Brandon] John! John?!

[Britney] What's happening?!
[muffled yelling]

[muffled yelling and screaming]
[demonic voice]

[music intensifies]

Take it, take it, John!

John, take the bat!

Take the bat!

[music subsides]
[Luna] John, are you alright?


[Stacy] What happened?
[Luna] Hey, Riley, get him some water!


[Britney] I don't understand!
[John] I'm alright.

Just drink some water, okay?

[Monica] Give him room.
[Jack] This doesn't make sense.

[Jack] What the fuck happened?
[Britney] I don't have my phone,

does anyone have their phone?


Why were we on the ground?

Water's turned off.
[Monica] Calm down.


is going on, you guys?!

[intense music]
[Brandon yells]

[Luna] Brandon?! Brandon!
[Jack] Dude, hey! What?!





[Luna] What?
[Riley] What do you mean?

We can't take them off?

What fuck does that mean?
[Britney] What are you talking about?


We can't take them off.
[Jack] What the fuck do you mean

we can't take them off?

[Stacy] What's going on?
[Britney] This has to be a dream...

[intense music]
[Jack yelling in pain]

This is so fucked up!

[Riley] No...
[Britney] This can't be real.

[Monica] Hold on.
[Britney] This is so fucked up,

this can't be real.


[intense music]
[Luna screams]


This is a fucking dream.

I feel pretty fucking awake right now.

[Brandon] What the fuck!
[Luna] I'm losing my fucking mind!

How is this even possible?



[Britney] Yeah.
[Jack] Fuck this!


[Luna] What?
[Riley] It's boarded up?


No.
No.

No, now I know this is a fucking dream.
No fucking way! No, no, no no!

This is not real!

[Luna] Help!
[Brandon] What the fuck is going on?!

[Luna] Help!
[Brandon] Try the window!

[Britney] Open it, seriously!
[Riley] No, no, no, no!

[Monica] Stop freaking out!
[group yelling]

[Monica] Hold on! Guys, hold the fuck on!
[group yelling]

[Monica] We have to stay calm! Relax!
[group yelling]




Dream or not,

this is a fucked up situation,

and we need to think.

Who remembers what happened

before we passed out?


Last thing I remember is pizza.


Riley, your mom was acting really weird.

[Luna] Yeah.
How long has she been that way?

I don't know you...

You think she had
something to do with this?

boarded up the house by herself.

[television static]

What the hell?

[male voice] Journal 153.

My greatest experiment.

We've proven

that the human brain is unlimited.

[electricity]
[Crazy Girl screams]

That's shocking the body and administering

psychiatric medications

make the brain impressionable.

And in this vulnerable state,
we can impress

deep within the all-powerful mind commands.

And not just buy this magazine

or eat this food,

but commands

which only the brain and its infinite

potential can grant.

[low rumble, electricity]
[Crazy Girl screaming]

On a moment's notice,

through triggers on a television,

a computer, a game, a phone, even music...

we can create subjects

who will act upon our every command

without fear,

without remorse.

Subjects who will go beyond
our public trials.

But coming true
weapons of mass destruction

that we can use in lands foreign

or domestic...

Now mental disorders have been used

to prepare the world with medication.

We're ready for the next step.

We've begun tests of greater magnitude.

[Brandon] What the fuck?
[Luna] Was that shooting today?

Fuck, man. I don't know what kind of

fucked up shit is going on here,

but count me the fuck out.


Dude, is that a real shotgun?


If it's got bullets in it

just take it and shoot
the door off.

[Brandon] Fuck.
[Luna] Yeah.

I wouldn't do that.

[sinister female voice] He says
I'm not supposed to kill you.

[Brandon] What the fuck?
[Stacy] Guys?

Oh, my God.





How do we get out of here?

You survive.

Didn't they tell you?

What?

Your memory must not be so good,

[echoing voice]

Look,

I don't know what's going on here,

but can we have a conversation?

We are having a conversation.

Pills?

Taste good.

Please

tell us how to get out of here.

Going once,

going twice...

More for me.

I have a movie show you.

He put me here to say something...

He put me here to say something!


[Crazy Girl laughs]

It's...

[echoed snap]
[whoosh]

[dark echoed voice]

[heavy breathing]

What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

Where the fuck are we?!

[young adults frantic]

That actually worked.

Fuck you!!

John!
John!

John!
Don't hurt him!

Fuck!
Hey, hey, hey!


[Crazy Girl] Brandon! Jack.
[Monica] Stop.

Monica.
[Stacy] Let him go!

I will kill him.

[Stacy] Shit!
[Britney] Guys, back up!

I'm good with minds.

I'm good with internal organs
and things too.


But I'm hoping I don't have to use my skills
at this moment.


[Crazy Girl] Because I want to watch this.

Sit, please.


I don't have to be polite.


Do what she says.


Sit down.

Thank you.

[John grunts]

I really enjoy killing.

But he says I'm not supposed to kill you.

I'm just an usher.

I'm just an usher...

Come on!

Come on, work!

[television static]

[male voice] Journal 301,

how I got into the crazy business.

When I was a young boy, I was deathly

afraid of the monsters in my

closet and under my bed.

My mother
was a nurse at a local asylum, so...

She used to treat me...

Every Friday night, she would tie me up,

and make me watch horror films

and footage of the horrors of society...

as she listened to Marion Harris,

and doing her crossword puzzles
and her board games.

Suppose I do have to thank her, though.

Because in the end, the treatment worked.

I wasn't scared anymore.

I was so accustomed to fear,

it became part of me.

And it will become part of you too...

Enjoy the experiment.

[television static]

That's where you're meant to go,

your family

and your friends and such are in there.



He says I'm not supposed to kill you.

I'm not supposed to kill you.



[Riley's Mom] Riley!

Mom?

[Riley's Mom] Riley!


Riley.

Hey, Riley.

[Riley] Mom?
[Riley's Mom] Riley!!

[Riley's Mom] Quickly!!


[Jack] What the...
[grunt]

[startled voices]

[Riley's Mom] Come here!
[Britney] Guys?

[Brandon] Hey, man.
[Riley's Mom] Come here...


Hey back the fuck up, man!
[Riley] Shit, it's the fucking pizza guy!

Hey, hey!

Hey man, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[yelling and screaming]

[Jack] Shoot him, man!
[Luna] Brandon!


[gunshot]
[screams]

Oh!
Fuck!

[yelling and screaming]


[music intensifies]

[John] Ugh.
[yelling and screaming]





[Brandon yelling]

Kill them!

[gunshot]
[Brandon yells]

Fuck! Oh god!


God!
[Luna] Brandon, what's wrong?!

Come on, tell me!
[Brandon] I'm fucking dying!

What?!

I'm fucking dying!


Turn him over!
[Jack] What the fuck!

Oh, it's like I've been shot!



[Jack] You okay? Hey, hey!
[Luna] Oh my god.

[Luna] Oh!
[Brandon] What the fuck..

[heavy breathing]
[Luna] Get him up.


No!

No, guys, I can't, I fucking can't.

I can't, that fucking guy!

That's the guy who delivered
our fucking pizza!

I knew I'd fucking seen that guy!
[Jack] We're in a hospital?!

This isn't real!

Taking too long!



Fuck!
Oh, my God!

[gasping, gushing]
[metal clang]


[Crazy Girl] He says I'm
not supposed to kill you.

Well, fuck him!

I'll do whatever the fuck I want.

You have about ten seconds until she dies.

Ten!
[Brandon] Guys...



[Jack] How?
Nine.


Eight.

[Monica] Go!!
Seven.


[Brandon] The fuck is going on?!
[Crazy Girl] Six.

[gasping for air]


[Luna] This is crazy!
[Jack] How the fuck did we get in

a fucking hospital?


[Crazy Girl] Three. Two.


[Crazy Girl] One.
[gasping]

[frantic yelling]

[Crazy Girl] Zero.

[Crazy girl giggle]


Kill them.

[pained shouting]

Kill them.

Fuck.

[demonic voice] Crack his head open.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]
[grunting]

[John yells]

[crack, gushing]

[demonic voice] Good.

Kill them.



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Come on!

[demonic voice] You have to kill them all.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[door slams open]
Let's go!

Come on!
[crazy laughter]

[grunting]
[bat hits]

[John yells]


John!

[Crazy Girl] I choose you!


Come on!

[Crazy Girl laughing all around]
[John] Fuck you!

Come on! Show yourself!

[Crazy Girl laughing and calling John]


[John] Fuck!
[Crazy Girl screams]





Come on!

[Crazy Girl] John!

Where are you?!

[Crazy Girl] John!
[laughter]

Fuck you! Come on!

[laughter and taunts from all directions]

Show yourself!

Come on!

[Crazy Girl whispers "John"]

[Crazy Girl] John, over here.

Come on!

[Crazy Girl] Behind you.

[John yells]

[Crazy Girl] Behind you.

Ah! Come on!

Show yourself!

[slice hit]

[flesh ripping]


John, it's okay.

It's okay.

My psychiatrists do this
all the time. Shh.

My psychiatrists do this all the time.

Shh, John.

John, just go with it.


[heavy breathing]


Shh.

[Britney and Monica yelling]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[pain sounds]


Medicamenta mentem tuam, corpus
tuum et animum tuum pertractant.

[distant insane screams]
[Jack] Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

[Riley painful screams]





[demonic voices in head]

I don't feel right.


You okay?

I don't feel right...

Something's really wrong, Jack,

and I'm scared.


It's talking to me.

What?

[Riley's Mom] Riley!

[Riley's Mom] Help me!
Mom?

[Riley's Mom] Riley!

[Riley's Mom] Hurry,
before they come back.

[Riley] Mom? Mom.
[heavy breathing]

What's wrong with you?

What do you mean?

Your eyes.

I'm all right.

No.

It's just the medicine
I've been taking. I'm okay.

Come on!

No.

You drugged us.

Why would I do that?

[scissors snipping]

No.
[louder voices in head]

[Riley's Mom] Riley.

Stop.

Argh! Stop it!
[Riley's Mom] Riley!

[Riley's Mom] Come here!

Stop!

Come here!
[Jack] Fuck.

[demonic voice] Do what
your mother tells you!

[Riley crying]

[Riley] Why, mom?!
[demonic shouting]

[Riley crying]

[Monica and Britney] Kill them, kill them.

Kill them, kill them.

Kill them all.

Fuck.

Are you seeing those fucking images?

Fuck!

Oh god!
Let's just find a way out of here.

How the fuck are you so calm?

I'm not!

Well you sure fucking act like...

There's just no reason
to freak out about it.

We assess the situation,

we figure out how to handle it,
and we do it, okay?

Yeah.

Yeah.

[distant insane people scream]


[breathing shakily]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[gun cocks]


[chanting voices in head]

[heavy breathing]

How is this possible?

I don't know.

[circuit breaker switched on]

Fuck...

Mom?

Dad?

Sam?

Luna...

What are you doing?

[evil voice] Kill!
[Luna] Sam.



Sam, you'd better listen to me!
Stop right now.

[Luna] Stop it. Stop!
[Brandon] Hey, hey.




[Luna] Sam, you'd better listen to me.
[Brandon] Hey!

Stop that right now!
Luna!

[evil voice] Kill!
[Luna] Sam!

And at that point,

If you haven't made it

you will immediately be killed.

Oh yes.

Now my journals will help ease

you in and to understand

All you have to do now
is choose another house.

don't let her die.

Death only makes things harder,

as I'm sure you've seen.

Luna... Luna!

[The Superintendent] Luna,

has gone to another house.

She can stand quicker than you.

But you'd better hurry.

She doesn't have very much time.

She's in that house right there.

I need you to pick up Riley.

We need to go after him.

Come on.

Come on.

We need to go.

I'm not going anywhere.

What the fuck is this insane shit?! Huh?

[Britney] You're going to be okay.
[Jack] Does this make any sense to you?!

I am not going to die tonight.

I've seen enough crazy shit

I don't care.
You saw what just happened to us.


We have to be fucking discreet.

We're fucking surviving.

[television static]

[The Superintendent] Journal 304.

[Jack] Shit.
[Britney] What the fuck.

From the hypnotic effects

of modern medications.

We no longer need

to administer electric shocks

to gain compliance.

The drugs act as a shock in themselves.

We only have to give the commands
and they'll follow.

[slashes and blood splatter]

Many subjects have undergone

these tests to great success
all over the country.

[The Superintendent] The results are...

sufficient...

which leads us to our latest experiment.

[Riley] Mom.
As you can see, I have entered the area,

educated the public and convinced them

onto the medication.


Now we use them how we see fit.

And that was just the beginning.

One by one, they moved
to influence one another,

spreading the drug amongst themselves,

rendering the town

into a mass, hypnotic state.

[television static]

No fucking way.

These motherfuckers...
No.

No, that's not...
[Brandon] We have to find Luna.

How's that possible?

They can't do that.

They can't do that!

Yes, they fucking can.

This shit isn't real,

we just saw the whole fucking town!

I know what we just saw!

I'm telling you it's real!

It's what LSD was developed for
with MKUltra in the 1950s.

Basic mind control.
[Jack] MKUltra? Bullshit!

We need to get Luna, we find her
and we get the fuck out of here

Now!
How are we supposed to do that?

We're not supposed to do that.

You think they're going to
fucking let us leave, huh?

After seeing that shit?!
[Brandon] We'll figure something out!

Hey, Brandon's right.

We have to figure a way out.

It's the only fucking way.

I'm fucking going.

Good,

Fuck you!!

Fuck you!!
Follow the instructions!

its power is remarkable.

It seems to be some sort of engine...

It has the power to make what's
in your mind manifest.

[The Superintendent] How far does that go?

[The Superintendent]I'll continue to do more tests...

Why?!

[The Superintendent] Journal 310.

The key experiment.

We've administered the drug

and installed the commands

in the young adults... Subjects B.

Triggers and phrases

will bring them
into hallucinated realities

where they'll unknowingly
follow the commands.

[echoing voice]

[ear ringing]

[echoed voice] If you take off your weapon

you get an extreme migraine

and die in 60 seconds. You see your family
and friends killing you.

You see each house
in my supernatural vision.

Kill them.

[evil demonic laughter]

[The Superintendent]
You will commit mass murder.

[loud whimpering]

Subjects A...

...the families
that we've been controlling for

the past few weeks

have been released from our control

to become trial victims.

They're given only two commands.

One...

not to leave the house.

Two...

To agree to
the imaginings of Subjects B.

This shows the power of the mind

Somehow Subjects A respond to
the fabricated rules of Subjects B

without being told what those rules are...

Telepathic communication.

Subjects B are weapons...

killing their loved ones without remorse.

Death will act as a trigger,

reinforcing the commands.

If they try to resist,

they will attack themselves,
however they see most fitting.

Now, I believe that we can
achieve our aims with drugs,

hypnotic commands, and triggers alone...

However,

many of my colleagues in The Association

believe our government sponsors

have a point
in the usage of The Technology.

I consider it to be overkill.

Why expend that much force

if you don't have to?

Although, it is quite effective.

[magic wand]
[Jack] Britney run!

Subjects A have fully become the monsters
Subjects B believed them to be.

your mother, me...

You need to stop her.

My psychiatrists

[Lily's heavy breathing]

[indistinct whispering]

Cebem maha munstro!
[electrical malfunctions]


You know,

psychiatry began with torture.

Not many people know that.

The original torture was used to rid

people of evil spirits.

They were trying
to get the evil spirits out,

but not in the way
they said they were.

Copsom darei! [electrical discharge]

Come on!!

use the evil spirits.

They were trying to rile them up

and to make them angry

to even turn someone into an evil spirit...

A witch.

Psychiatry was never meant for healing.

They went from torture devices,

to ice pick lobotomies, to electric shock

to pills.

To me... their greatest achievement.

[desk hit, quivering inhale]

I don't feel healed.

Hitler used them for Nazi work.

Well, I will not be used!

Perperiem... [incorrect language]

[electrical discharge]

Ahh!!

God damn it! These things
never work when you need them to!

Use it. No.

You could use it on everyone.
You could kill everyone.

No, god...

You are powerful! You are amazing!

This is necessary...

You're my greatest experiment.

You will be the strongest of them all.

Congratulations.

You three have survived.

[The Superintendent] So what you will do
is take one a day for seven days

and it'll wean you off the medication

we gave you earlier.

[rattling pills]

I suggest you start now.

[The Superintendent] Come on.

Come on, take them.


Good.

Brandon, let's go.

Haha, good...

Good, Monica.

You've all provided us with
very useful information.

Having been put through
rigorous clinical trials they're

set to begin mass production next week.

When we come back,

experts from the
Global Psychiatric Association

will discuss what this means
for the field of mental health.

by Paxoloft SR...

the only medication

clinically proven
to help anxiety disorders
