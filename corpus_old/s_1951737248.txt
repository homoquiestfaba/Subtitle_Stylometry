...duty to welcome you
here on the behalf of...

...all the other artists, and musicians
with combined talents...

...went in to the creation of this
new form of entertainment: Fantasia.

What you'll see on the screen...

...is a picture of various abstract images...

...that might pass to your mind...

...if you seat in a concert hall,
listening to this music.

Now, there are three kinds
of music on this fantasia program.

First is the kind
that tells a definite story.

Then there's the kind that,
while has no specific plot...

...does paint a series
of more or less definite pictures.

And there's the third kind;
music that exist simply for tones sake.

And the number that opens
out Fantasia program...

...is music of this third kind.

You know, what's amazing is that many of
these musicians are playing for the very first time.

Thanks to Steve Martin's two week
Master Musician Home Study Course.

More about that later.

Hello and welcome
to Fantasia 2000.

 It's been more that 60 years since
Walt Disney and his artists teamed up...

...with Maestro Leopold Stokowski
to create a film they titled: The Concert Feature.

I think, we're all glad that they
changed the name to Fantasia.

You know, Fantasia was meant
to be a perpetual work in progress.

Every time you went to see it, you'd experience
some new pieces along of some old familiar favorites 

But that idea felt
by the way side until now.

So, let me turn things over
to the great Itzhak Perlman...

...who, I've just been informed,
plays the violin.

Well, so do I.
Can I have my violin, please?

Ah, thank you.

All right, boys.
Hoo. Oh, sorry.

Could I have another string thingy please?
Oh, and camera back on me?

Camera back on me!

When you hear a title like Pines of Rome,
you might think of tree line streets and romantic ruins.

But when the Disney animators
heard this music...

...they thought of something
completely different.

Here is the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Maestro James Levin...

...performing Ottorino Respigi's
Pines of Rome.

Hi. Next, we're gonna take you
to the streets of New York City...

...for piece that's been inspired
by couple of my favorite artists.

First, there's the illustrator Al Hirschfeld,

who's been drawing celebrities and
Broadway stars for most of the 20th century.

And then, there's the composer
and song writer George Gerschwin,

who took Jazz off the streets,
dressed her up and took it to the concert hall.

My friend Ralph Grierson
plays piano on this next number.

And it all starts with the single slinky note
on the clarinet and a simple line on a piece of paper.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Rhapsody in Blue.

Hi. You may not know this,
but over the years...

...the Disney artists have cooked up
dozens of ideas for new Fantasia segments.

Some of them made it
to the big screen this time...

but others, lots of others
how can I put this politely - didn't.

For example:
The Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen...

...drew these sketches for a segment
inspired by Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

Here they are.
And there they go.

Now, Salvador Dali, you know,
the limp watches guy...

he got in to the act with an idea that
featured baseball as a metaphor for life.

How come that didn't work?
Makes perfect sense to me!

Let's see. Then, we had a bug ballet, and a baby ballet, and for a time,

they even considered the sequence inspired by the polka and the fuge.

From Weinberger's Schwanda, the bagpiper.

But finally - a success.

The Disney artists wanted to create a short film
based on Hans Christian Anderson's wonderful fairytale -

The Steadfast Tin Soldier. But they could
never find the perfect musical match.

Until now.

Here is Yefim Bronfman playing
Schostakovich Piano Concerto No. 2...

...and the Steadfast Tin Soldier.
