The symptoms of this crisis
of the American spirit

are all around us.

WOMAN :
USA Hockey.

Please hold .

USA Hockey.

He's just stepping
into a meeting .

When's the best time
to reach you?

He's got your number?

Okay.

Herb.

Hey, Walter.
How we doing?

Good to see you .

How was the flight?

Oh , not bad .

Well , that's great.

Everybody's waiting to see us.

Who all's here?

Just money who's got a say
in this thing .

Bob Fleming , the lnternational
Council , USA Hockey.

Lou Nanne, l think you know,
from the NHL.

The only way we can compete
with the Eastern Bloc teams

is if we're willing to change.

Change what?

The way we train , the way we
prepare, even our schedule.

What kind of scheduling changes
are we talking about?

l think we need to
make it longer.

Much more competitive.

Longer?
You gonna pay for that?

We also need to change the way
we play the game.

What exactly does that mean?

My plan is to adopt a new style.

A hybrid of the Soviet school
and the Canadian school .

A combination that requires the
highest level of conditioning ,

speed , creativity,
and most of all , team chemistry.

ls this what you've been using
at the University of Minnesota?

We've been phasing it in over
the last couple of years.

He has won
three NCAA titles, fellas.

Walter, we don't have years.
We have months.

You think you can take kids
who've never played together

and teach them a new style
of play in the time we have?

Here's the North American style.

What if these kids can't
pick it up fast enough?

We all know we're
a long shot for a medal ,

but we don't want to
get embarrassed .

-That's right.
-That's right.

Bob, four years ago,
our Olympic team

lost to the Czech ''B'' team .

l think it was 1 5-1 .

ln all due respect, l don't
think we can embarrass ourselves

any more than that.

That's assuming
they don't go pro.

l don't know about you , but l'd
have a hard time giving up money

to finish sixth at Lake Placid .

lt's a tough draw, Herb.
Tough draw.

lt's a tough draw even if
we don't play the Soviets.

What the hell happens if we do?

We put our best on the ice
with them last year.

Professional all-stars.
They still beat us.

lt wasn't because
you weren't good enough .

All-star teams fail

because they rely solely
on the individual's talent.

The Soviets win because
they take that talent

and use it inside a system

that's designed for
the betterment of the team .

My goal is to beat them
at their own game.

Beat the best team in the world?

Gold medalists in
'64, '68, '7 2 , '7 6?

That's a pretty lofty goal ,
Herb.

Lou , that's why l want to
pursue it.

Well , fellas,
any more questions?

-l'm good .
-No?

That's it for me.
Thanks.

lt's good seeing you .

-Herb, thanks.
-Thanks a lot.

-Thanks a lot.
-Appreciate it.

Hey.

lt's coming down out there.

Hey, where are the kids?

Oh , l gave them away.

How'd it go?

Ah , l'm not their guy.

The only reason
they had me come out there

was because two other coaches
already said no.

l think they're still
looking East coast.

What's that?

-lt's a costume party, Herb.
-No, Patti .

Come on . Nick and Nora Charles.
''The Thin Man .''

You're gonna make me wear this?

They're sophisticated , they're
dashing , they're debonair.

l've got a mustache for you .

-No, Patti .
-A little dog for me.

All right, it's gonna be

-Herb.
-Yeah?

Herb.

You've got a call from Colorado.

We're not done here.

Yes, well , so then he what?

He just went along with that?

Well , l appreciate that, Walter.

Thank you .

What'd they say?

l got the job.

l got the job.
How about that, huh?

Oh , great! Oh !

-When do you start?
-Two weeks.

Two weeks? They want you
to start that soon?

The games are in February.

Yeah , but it's June.
ls there even ice?

Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy.

We're supposed to take the kids
to the Black Hills.

l know, l know.

Cleopatra's leaving ,

Okay. Okay.

l gotta call Craig Patrick

-Hey, Buzz.
-Hey.

What's going on?

-How are you doing?
-Good .

-Phil Verchota.
-Verchota?

Ralph Cox. U .N .H .

Name, please.

-Mike Ramsey.
-Hi , Mike.

Number, towel .

Jack O'Callahan , right?

-Last time l checked .
-Good luck.

-Thanks, buddy.
-Who's next?

Jimmy Craig .

Hey, Jack.

What's up, you sieve?

-How's it going?
-Good .

ls there a reason why
Joey Mullen's not here?

Yeah , about 30,000 of them ,

all sitting in
his New York bank account.

He got a $30,000 signing bonus?

-Crazy, isn't it?
-Yeah .

How's it looking?

A lot of guys
from Minnesota and Boston .

Yeah , that's gonna work.

You're Robbie McClanahan , right?

Yeah .

Mike Eruzione.
Boston University.

'7 6.

'7 6.

Try to play for Brooks
a little more, huh?

l played for him for four years.

A few more months wouldn't hurt.
How about you?

Just trying to play a little
more hockey, that's all .

Rest of your boys all here?

Of course.
Think they'd miss out on this?

Might want to wait a day or so
before you go over and say hi .

[ Whistle blows ]

Check!
Come on , hit those lines!

Head for the net!
The net!

Come on , come on !

Skate, boys! Skate!

Skate!

Drop your shoulder!

On the wing !

Hey, go to the blue line!

Man , look at that move.

Whoo, Rizzo!

Eruzione?

Cross him off the list.

Kid doesn't have a shot
of making this team .

-You think so?
-No way.

One more!

Do it again !

Pucks in , pucks in !

Forward ! Blue line!

So, Doc cleared him .
Says it's just a sprain .

Good .

l wanted to let you know

how much l'm looking forward to
being able to coach with you .

You were a hell of
a player, Craig .

And you're gonna make
a hell of a coach .

Thanks.

l'm gonna need you to
stick tight with these kids.

lf there's any big problems,
you'll let me know.

Otherwise, you take
care of it, okay?

Okay.

Take a look at that.

What's this?

26 names.

The tough part
will be getting it to 20

before the opening ceremonies.

What, this is the final roster?

You're kidding me, right?

This is our first day, Herb.
l mean , we got a week of this.

What about the advisory staff?

Aren't they supposed to
have a say in this?

Technically, l guess.
l don't know.

Well , you're missing
some of the best players.

l'm not looking
for the best players.

l'm looking for the right ones.

You have Jim Craig
to back up Janaszak?

Other way around .

Other way around?

l'm sorry, didn't Janaszak just
win you a National Championship?

Jannie is a solid goaltender,
but we're not playing

for the National Championship
here, Craig .

People l speak to
say Craig's game has been off

since his mom died .

Did they ever see him
when his game's on?

Hughes. Ross.

Auge. Delich .

Horsch . Strobel .

Christoff. Morrow.

Suter. Ramsey.

Janaszak. Christian .

Pavelich . Verchota.

Baker. Harrington .

Schneider. O'Callahan .

McClanahan . Silk.

Johnson . Craig .

Cox. Eruzione.

And that's the roster for now.

Rest of you ,
thanks for coming out.

-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Robbie.

Way to go, Rizzo.

Take a good look, gentlemen .

'Cause they're the ones
getting off easy.

We're putting
a few of you on reserve

in case somebody gets injured
or their game goes to hell .

The final roster will have
20 names on it in 7 months,

so more of you are going home.

You give 99% , you'll make
my job very, very easy.

l'll be your coach .
l won't be your friend .

lf you need one of those, take
it up with Doc or Coach Patrick.

God .

PATRlCK:
All right, gentlemen .

Congratulations to all of you .

That's it for today.

On the way out,
pick up one of these.

You've got a little homework
to do before you celebrate.

Thank you .

Whoo!

Herb!

Herb.

Hold on a minute.

Hey, Walter.
How we doing?

l think we got
a problem here, Herb.

What's that?

l got a roomful
of people up there

who want to have a say
in this process,

and you've already
picked the team .

-Look, Walter.
-No, no.

There's a right way to do
this kind of thing ,

and this is not it.

l know you got a job to do.

lf l was in your shoes,
l'd be saying the same thing .

All right, then .

Let's go upstairs.

We'll help piece together
a hockey team .

All of us.
Together.

Walter, that's just
not gonna happen .

Do you realize
what the A.H .A. went through

to put this thing together?

The best amateur players in the
country on the ice for a week?

-Yeah .
-Not just a day.

l didn't ask for that,
because l already know my team .

How do you know your team?

Those kids haven't been on the
ice for maybe a couple of hours.

Every one of those boys was
chosen for a specific reason .

l've studied film
on each one of those boys.

l've watched them ,
and l've coached a lot of them .

The ones l haven't,
l've spoken with their coaches

and scouts in the area.

Now, l know best
what l need to compete.

And the team l've chosen is it.

What am l supposed to say
to the advisory board?

Tell them the truth .

This puts me
in a hell of a spot, Herb.

A hell of a spot!

Well , they hired me to do a job.
l'm trying to do it.

All right.

l'm gonna back you on this.

But l sure as hell hope
you know what you're doing .

Hey, Phillie, what are you on?

My test is done.

Jesus!

Me and Jannie are done.

Verchota, you're done?
l'm on page four.

''7 1 .

You get stopped by a policeman ,
but you're not at fault.

Do you state
your disagreement right away?''

He's got 300 of these things.

lt's just a test, Silky.

You've taken one or two before.

Not to play hockey, l haven't.

Can you even read , Silky?

l try.

Hey, Rizzo!

-What's going on?
-Mac.

Easy, big guy.

l don't know how you can sit in
the same room with that clown .

Let it go. lt's over.
Let it go.

What's going on here?

O.C.'s got a little
unfinished business over there.

Not for long l don't.

What did l tell you , man?

McClanahan?

You're not still going on about
the '7 6 playoffs, are you?

Come on , O.C. , that was,
like, three years ago.

You know what, Coxie,
let me ask you a question .

Why did you want to
play college hockey?

lsn't it obvious?
For the girls.

l'm serious, Coxie.

Why did you want to
play college hockey?

'Cause l love to play hockey.

l want to go to the NHL
just like everybody does.

l wanted to win
a National Championship.

That pansy over there
cheap-shots me.

l get tossed out of the game.

He steals the ring
right off my finger?

How would you feel?

Everyone was throwing
cheap shots that night.

Rizzo, it's funny you say that.

l was just wondering
what side you're on .

l'm on your side.

You know,
it really seems that way.

All right, just relax, okay?
Jeez.

l'm not doing this right now.

l'm outta here.

Where you going?

To my room . ls that
all right with you , Mother?

CO X:
Just let him go.

Well , no wonder the guy
gets so many penalty minutes.

SlLK: He gets a little
carried away sometimes.

HERB: That's it.
Pick it up.

-That's it.
-Kick it out!

Look for the pass.
Come on , hit him with a pass.

-Go, Johnson !
-Outside!

All right, Johnson ,
hit him on the other side.

-Get them up!
-Look for him !

Move and hit him , Johnson .
He's open .

-Center, center!
-Come on , Johnson !

[ Whistle blows ]

Johnson !

That stuff may work here,

but it won't against
the teams we'll be playing .

Next line up.
Let's go. Let's run it again .

Morrow.

Let me take this one.

Don't worry about it.
Keep your head up.

HERB: This is
a breakout play, gentlemen .

So, please, let's get rid
of the puck early.

All right, let's go!

Hey, hey!

-Oh !
-Oh , my God .

-What's O.C. doing?
-That was cheap.

He didn't have the puck.

What are you hitting
like that for?

That's bush league, O.C.

Nice hit, O.C.

Tell your boy to keep his head
up, and he won't have to worry.

You all right, man?

Let's go!

Craig , let them go.

You got him?

-Hey, stay on him !
-Stay out of it, Buzzy!

Get him .
Come on , give it to him .

-What are you doing?
-Stay out of it, Baker!

Come on , give it to him !

All right, Mac.

Come on , Mac.
Take him down !

Come on , O.C. !
Let him have it!

-Put him on the ice!
-Come on , O.C.

There you go.
Beat him , O.C.

-Oh !
-Oh , man !

Whoa!

That's it.

HERB:
Well , how about it, boys?

Look like hockey to you?

Looks like a couple of monkeys
trying to hump a football to me.

What do you think, Craig?

Yeah .

You want to settle old scores,
you're on the wrong team .

We move forward
starting right now.

We start becoming a team
right now!

Skating .

Passing .

Flow.

Creativity.

That is what this team
is all about, gentlemen .

Not old rivalries.

Why don't we start
with some introductions?

You know, get to know
each other a little bit.

Where you're from , who you are.
Go ahead .

Rob McClanahan .

St. Paul , Minnesota.

Who you play for?

For you , here at the U .

Jack?

Jack O'Callahan .

Charlestown , Mass.

Boston University.

Over here.

l'm Ralph Cox.

l'm from wherever's
not gonna get me hit.

Very good .

Everybody on the line.
Let's go.

# <i>Must of got lost</i> #

# <i>Must of got lost</i> #

-Hey, Jim .
-Hey, Coach .

Been wondering why
you wouldn't take this test.

Yeah . Well . . .

lt's nothing against you
or anything .

l just don't see what it has to
do with stopping a puck.

Well , that's all right.
You just took it anyway.

# <i>Honey, l don't know</i> #

Hey, Coach .

So, if l took it. . .

You know, l meant to ask you .

How's your family doing?

Doing all right.

And you?

l'm okay.

You know, l got 26 guys
trying to make this team , Jim .

Only 20 are gonna go
to Lake Placid .

So l gotta know how committed
you are to being here.

Because if you're not,
you're just wasting our time.

Look, Coach .

My dad's going through
a rough time right now.

He's got nothing .

He lost his job, and with
Atlanta trying to sign me. . .

Bottom line is,
my mom wanted this.

Me playing on this team .

Hard to say no to someone who
drove you to practice every day.

You didn't answer
my question , Jim .

l'm here, aren't l?

l'll see you in the morning .

Don't forget to bring your game.

MAN ON RADlO: The Soviets
performed a nuclear test,

setting off a 7 5-kiloton bomb
in eastern Kazakhstan .

So much hate and fear.

-What's that?
-The Soviets and the West.

They have nuclear weapons
pointed at each other.

lt's bound to end in disaster.

Oh , come on . They'll figure
something out, Doc.

Don't got any other choice,
right?

Well , yeah , hope so.

But it seems to me there are
some people who never get along .

Yeah .

Like hockey players
from Boston and Minnesota.

Our own private Cold War.

Hey, Doc, let me ask you
a question , all right?

You've worked with Herb
for a long time, right?

l've known Herb
for quite some time.

So tell me something .

Does he always treat
his players like this?

No. No, no.
This l have never seen .

But, Craig , believe me.

Herb has a reason
for everything he does.

Well , he's ending up with
20 players who hate his guts.

Maybe if they hate him ,

they won't have time
to hate each other.

# <i>Out on Thunder lsland</i> #

# <i>Doo doo doo</i> #

# <i>Doo doo doo doo-doo</i> #

Hey, honey.

How much longer you gonna be?

l still got a few more.

Well , l'm going to bed , okay?

-Okay.
-Okay.

Oh , you know, Kelly has ballet
at 4:00 tomorrow

and Danny's done with hockey
camp at about the same time.

Which one do you want to get?

-Herb?
-Yeah .

Can you pick up Danny at 4:00?

We got team meetings
after practice tomorrow.

l can't be in two places
at one time.

-What about Margie?
-They're on vacation .

Well , l don't know, honey.
You'll figure it out.

Can you turn that off, please?

Please.

Herb, this is what happens
over the summer.

The kids are off
doing a zillion things,

and once in a while,
your meetings have to wait.

Come on , Patti .
l'm coaching a hockey team here.

l mean , we already
talked about this.

Oh , really?

When exactly
did we have this talk?

Because l don't recall being
a part of the conversation .

What did l say?

Was it interesting?

We never had this talk.

Never.

Okay, what's on your mind?

Nothing .

No, you're obviously mad
about something .

First you're upset
because we didn't talk.

And then when l try to talk
about whatever it is,

you don't want to.

Patti ,
if you're not willing to. . .

lt's not because we didn't talk.

lt's because
you never even asked .

l know what this is about.

l know it, and you know it.

What? Know what?

This.
What you're doing .

Chasing after something
you didn't get,

that you may never get.

What if it doesn't
work out, Herb?

Are we gonna do this
every four years?

lt's okay.

Go finish your work.
Go, go.

Hey.

Hey.

You know. . .

Ever since l stopped playing ,
l wanted to coach this team .

And this is the only way
l know how to do it.

lt's not the easiest way,
l know, for you .

Or the kids.
But. . .

Patti , l have to do this.

l know you do.

l'm sorry we didn't talk.

And l was wrong not to ask.

So l'm asking now if you
can be with me on this,

because it won't mean anything
if you're not.

Blue line, back.
Red line, back.

Far blue line, back.
Far red line, back.

And you have 45 seconds
to do it.

Get used to this drill .
We'll be doing it a lot.

Why?

Because the legs feed
the wolf, gentlemen .

l can't promise you
we'll be the best team

at Lake Placid next February.

But we will be
the best-conditioned .

That l can promise you .

[ Whistle blows ]

Be prepared to grow
through pain , gentlemen .

You're gonna skate harder
than you've skated in your lives

every minute of every day
you're on the ice with me.

Stretch things out
north and south ,

you open things up
east and west.

Center's gonna fill in here.

This far-side winger is gonna
come in , take the center spot.

-What's your name?
-Mark Johnson .

Where you from , Mark?

Madison , Wisconsin .

-Who you play for?
-University of Wisconsin .

[ Whistle blows ]

Come on , go, boys.
Go, boys!

The fastest way to make
this team is by being fast!

No, no!

Stop.
Look at you .

Three men being covered
by one guy.

This isn't weaving
for weaving's sake.

Spread out!
Use the ice!

-Right there.
-There? Okay.

Come on , Jimmy.

Challenge them !

You're getting beat
on the side here.

Challenge them .

Yeah , l don't blame you .

How you holding up?

-Oh , no.
-Not good , not good .

-How about you?
-Name's Christian .

-Who do you play for?
-University of North Dakota.

Pass it! Come on !
No!

No, no, no!

Get him to a point!

You're quarterbacking this play!

Come on , Rizzo,
l got you running this play!

You're gonna run the bench .

Mac, get out here!

Boom , he can hit him .
Boom . Boom . Boom .

We're opening up options, see?

We've got four options
off one play, guys.

You guys got that?
Anybody have any questions?

Okay, let's go.

-What is he talking about?
-No clue.

20 of you are going
to Lake Placid .

6 are going home.

Who that is, believe it or not,
is up to you .

-How about you?
-Mark Pavelich .

-Who do you play for?
-U .M.D. Bulldogs.

Let's go!
Next line up!

All right, turn it up, boys.

Let's move it, Bah .

Get it up, get it up!

Eric, it's open !

Here you go, here you go!

They can't stop us yet.

Attaway, Buzzy.
Nice pass.

That was a good shot.

You three.

-Run that again .
-Again?

-All right.
-Let's go.

Christ, we don't have a chance
in hell of winning .

So l understand how you feel .

Don't let them know that.

Yeah .

-All right.
-Thanks, Coach .

The Coneheads are coming in .

Who?

That's what the guys
have been calling them

'cause, well , they're
a little. . .[ whistles ]

You know, like the Coneheads.

What's that?

Dan Akroyd , Jane Curtin .

l guess it's off your radar.

Come on in , boys.

Wanted to see us, Coach?

Yeah , l'm thinking about

keeping the three of you
together on the same line.

Everybody okay with that?

-Yeah . Sure.
-Yeah .

How about you , Buzzy? You think
this works with Bah and Pav?

Yeah , it's going good .
Moving the puck well .

lt's different
playing with them .

We just seem to always
find each other

at the other end of the ice
and make things happen .

Pass, shoot, score.

-Pass, shoot, and . . .
-Score.

Well , all right.

We'll see how she goes.

-All right.
-Thanks, Coach .

Take it easy.

Rest up.

Well , looks like we're taking
a line of Coneheads to Europe.

Yeah , if they can keep
their legs under them .

All right, Herb,
l'll see you next week.

Something on your mind , Craig?

Or is that just
too far off my radar?

l don't think
you can push them this hard .

Not for six months.
lt's too long .

-They're doing all right.
-Well , whole team's tired .

l know how hard
to push them , Craig .

You sure about that?

You know why l had them
take that test?

Make sure l could
push them this hard .

l'll see you Monday.

All right.

Oh , wow. Dynamite.

Look over here, Phillie.
Section two, about four rows up.

Two girls. Blond .

Man , they're gorgeous.

What row?

About the seventh row up.
To the right.

Lovely blond girls.

Maybe we can take a few home.

Must be something in the water.

Get a whistle.

Good game.

-Good game.
-Good game.

Hold up, there.
Hold up, hold up.

Gotta get back on the ice.
Let's go.

-What for?
-You'll find out soon enough .

Let's go.
Back on the ice.

What for?

We'll find out in a minute,
won't we?

Come on ,
let's see what he wants.

Get a picture or something?

What's going on?

You guys don't want to
work during the game?

No problem .
We'll work now.

Goal line.

That one!

[ Whistle blows ]

Hustle!

Think you can win
on talent alone?

Gentlemen , you don't have enough
talent to win on talent alone.

Again .

[ Whistle blows ]

lf you think you can come here

and play the Norwegian
National team and tie them

and then go to the Olympics
and win . . .

You got another thing coming .

You better think about
something else,

each and every one of you .

When you pull on that jersey,

you represent yourself
and your teammates.

And the name on the front is
a hell of a lot more important

than the one on the back!

Get that through your head !

Again !

[ Whistle blows ]

Win , lose, or tie, you're
gonna play like champions!

Again !

Kick it in the ass, Verchota!

You want to go home early?

Keep it going , Suter.

All the way to the line
and all the way back.

lt's not that difficult.

Again !

Again .

Again !

Herb.

What?

The rink manager wants to clean
the ice and then go home.

Tell him to leave me the keys.
l'll lock up.

Again .

Again .

You keep playing this way,

you won't beat anybody who's
even good , let alone great.

You want to make this team ,

then you better start playing
at a level

that's gonna force me
to keep you here.

Again !

Thank God .

Think we're getting out of here?

Hey.

Where you going?

Back on the line.

Again .

Send them .

Again .

Again .

How about it, Silky? You gonna
be the first one to quit on me?

How about you , O.C.?
You ready to go down?

Oh , l think l got
my money on you , Verchota.

You got a hot date
in about an hour,

but you're not looking too good
for that right about now.

Send them .

Again .

Doc, l mean ,
this is madness, right?

[ Gagging ]

This cannot be a team
of common men

because common men go nowhere.

You have to be uncommon .

Again .

Herb!

This has gone on long enough !

Everybody on that line.

Somebody's going to get hurt!

[ Players coughing , wheezing ]

Everybody get on that line.

Hey.

Again .

Again .

Herb.

Come on , Craig .
Blow the whistle.

Again .

Mike Eruzione!

Winthrop, Massachusetts!

Who do you play for?

l play for
the United States of America.

That's all , gentlemen .

Come on , you Minnesotans!

My back's starting to hurt
from carrying you all .

Pretend you're pushing
some cows!

Why don't you stop talking ,
Boston boy, and start pushing?

-What do you got there, Pav?
-Three 9's.

Not bad , Pav.
Not bad .

l got two 7's.

Well , we were taxiing out
to the runway, right,

and we, you know,
we kind of hit a moose.

No, the moose is fine.

But we gotta make sure
the airplane's all right,

so some of the boys
are pushing it back

so these guys can take
a look at it.

Patti , the moose is okay.
He ran off. l saw it.

So, what's going on at home?

REPORTER:
Big matchup tonight in New York

between the NHL All-Stars
and the Soviet Union .

-Yeah , she did , huh?
-And this one was no contest,

as the Soviets dominated
the NHL's best

from start to finish ,
winning by a score of 6-0.

The Soviets, led by the
superb play of their captain ,

Boris Mikhailov,

were superior to the NHL stars
in every way tonight.

Their passing was crisper,
their offense was relentless,

and their conditioning , superb.

-No, l'm here. l'm listening .
-The Soviets coasting to a win

in New York tonight.

An embarrassing evening
for the NHL All-Stars.

Russian style of play, boys.

Fluid .
Creative.

Forwards are
constantly circling .

They don't so much look for the
man as they do a patch of ice.

They get the mismatch ,
two-on-one, easy goal .

Looks a lot like me
out there, huh , Buzz?

Boris Mikhailov.
Captain for the last six years.

He is the best player
at his position .

And that includes, as we've
just found out, the NHL.

Do these guys ever smile?

They're Russians.
They get shot if they smile.

HERB:
Vladislav Tretiak.

You score on Tretiak,
keep the puck.

'Cause it doesn't happen often .

42 games in the last 3 months.

42 wins.

Their main weapon
is intimidation .

They know they're gonna win ,
and so do their opponents.

Look, l can give you all
a load of crap

about how you're a better team
than they are,

but that's exactly what it'd be.

Everyone in this room knows what
people say about our chances.

l know it.
You know it.

But l also know there is a way
to stay with this team .

You don't defend them .
You attack them .

You take their game

and you shove it
right back in their face.

The team that is finally
willing to do this

is the team that has a chance
to put them down .

NHL won't change their game.
We will .

Rest of the world
is afraid of them .

Boys, we won't be.

No one has ever worked
hard enough

to skate with the Soviet team
for an entire game.

Gentlemen , we are
gonna work hard enough .

[ Whistle blows ]

Come on , quick feet, boys!
Quick feet! Work it!

Work hard now, boys!

Come on , Strobel ,
pick up your knees!

Keep your shoulders square.

Push it!

Come on , boys.
Go!

The legs feed the wolf, boys.
The legs feed the wolf.

Go! Stay with him , Jimmy!
Stay with him !

Damn it!

How's your legs?

l'll let you know
when l can feel them .

Come on , boys.

Go get him , go get him !

Attaboy, Jimmy.

Better.

Not good , but better.

You gotta have
the mental intensity, boys.

Move, boys!

There you go, there you go!

That's it.
Work it, boys. Work it.

Quick feet!
Push it!

Hit the tape, boys.

Passes come from the heart.

Want to stretch things out
north and south .

We got the Coneheads
on the line.

Take me through it here.
Bah .

l'm gonna stretch the ''D.''

Gonna open up some space.
What are we gonna do?

l fill the open lane.

l fill in for Pav's lane.

That's it, that's it!

Attaway, boys.

Come on .
Attaway, Jimmy!

Don't let them have it!

Attaboy! Yeah !

Come on , build your legs up,
boys. Build your legs.

You're not gonna have anything
left for the third period

if you don't
build your legs now.

Here.
What's that give us, boys?

-PLAYERS : Options.
-All right, let's run it.

-How's it going?
-What's going on?

We're playing the Soviets
three days before Lake Placid?

Yeah , how about that?

How about that?

How about that?

Ah , that won't work with Wells.

Oh , Rizzo, you're killing me.

Why can't you find the net?

You've been staring at the same
piece of paper since dinner.

Take a break.

How do l cut this kid?
He's done everything l've asked .

Well , so keep him .

l didn't think it was
gonna be this hard .

MAN ON TV:
This is ''NBC Nightly News.''

Yeah , you did .

With Jessica Savitch ,
and Dick Schaap with Sports.

This isn't gonna work.

l'd have to stick Christian
on defense.

The embassy in Tehran is in
the hands of Moslem students.

Wait. That works.

Spurred on
by an anti-American speech

-Or Baker.
-by the Ayatollah Khomeini ,

they stormed the embassy,

fought the Marine guard
for three hours,

overpowered them , and took
dozens of American hostages.

-Oh , my God .
-Maybe that'll work.

Herb.

We have two reports,
beginning with Steve Mallory.

MALLORY: United States Marine
Corps guards used tear gas

to try to disperse the mob
of lslamic students,

but that wasn't enough .

Hundreds of lranians finally
overran the embassy compound ,

seizing about 90 people,
mostly Americans.

The hostages, men and women ,
were blindfolded

and herded into
the embassy's basement.

Earlier today, the
Ayatollah Khomeini publicly. . .

We gave those guys at Harvard
a good schooling .

Hey!

How about Johnson
and McClanahan now?

Come on , that works.
Doesn't it?

They're starting to
come together.

Thanks for coming out.

l wouldn't have missed it.

-Hey, you beat Harvard .
-Yeah .

Well , l should
probably get going .

Yeah . Yeah .

l love you , Pop.

You too, son .

-Jimmy.
-Yeah?

You keep that glove up.

You got it.

Switch .

Rizzo's making dinner, boys.

You know there's gonna
be meatballs.

You boys keep eating them ,
l'll keep making them .

l think you guys
are insane to eat that stuff.

No offense, Rizzo.

l wonder how it's gonna affect
the chemistry of the boys.

l don't know.
We'll see.

Timmy.

Who the hell is that?

What's he doing here?

How you doing , Tim?
Good to see you .

Thanks, Coach .

Hey, Bah .

-Yeah?
-Who's that guy?

Timmy Harrer.
Plays for the Gophers.

Having a big year.

-What the hell's he doing here?
-No idea.

Why is he here?

Hey, you guys know
he was coming?

So, listen , why don't you
warm up, stretch out,

jump on Johnson's line
for the day, okay?

Good to have you here.

-See you , boys.
-See you .

This is ridiculous.

Don't worry about it, Rammer.
lt'll be all right.

Right, O.C.?

Herb's not gonna do
a damn thing , boys.

He's just messing
with our minds.

Oh , you think so, Jack?

Yeah , l do.

Well , we all know Herb made
the Olympic team back in '60.

So?

So, a week before the games,

Coach Riley calls him into
his office and sends him home.

What's your point?

My point, Jack,
is that one week later,

Herb's on his couch
with his old man ,

watching his team win
the gold medal .

Come that close and get nothing?

He'll do whatever it takes.

That's my point.

Yeah , l'm aware of that, Walter.

Yeah .

Yeah , well , you've talked to
everybody else then , all right.

Nothing else we can do, then .
Thank you , Walter.

ls everything okay?

Walter says that there's talk
Carter may boycott

the Moscow games next summer.

So if we don't go there,
they might not come here, right?

Right.

Don't do this to yourself, Herb.

There are things you can control
and things you can't.

No milk.

Herb.

Yeah , l heard you , honey.

You'll still have everything
you won here.

Don't tell me
what l'll have, Patti .

You don't know this enough
to tell me that.

You know, l understand
you being upset with me

when l say you work too hard
teaching a simple game.

But don't ever criticize me
for caring about you .

[ Whistle blows ]

HERB: That's it.
Come on , boys, push it.

Here we go! Push it!
Go now! Move!

Damn it!

Come on , Rizzo.

l know, Coach .

-l know.
-You know?

lf you knew,
then why did you do it again?

You start putting
the puck in the net,

or you're not going anywhere.

And don't think l won't do it.

Johnson , line up!
Let's go!

Come on !
Shoot it!

Up and around !
Keep it moving !

Attaboy!

Center, center, center!

-Now move it up!
-Go, Mike, go!

Drop it back.

Go to the net, Timmy!
Go to the net!

Go, go, go!

-[ Buzzer ]
-Whoo!

Yeah !

Nice play, boys.
Nice play.

ANNOUNCER: Goal scored
by number 1 8, Tim Harrer.

Change them up, boys.
Let's go.

Come on , boys.

Let's go, boys!

Timmy.

You keep driving the net.
That's all l care about, okay?

That puck goes across the
blue line, you drive to the net.

Okay.

All right.

Herb.

Some of the boys
want to have a word .

What about?

l think you ought to
hear them out.

This had better take
about two minutes.

This is crazy, Herb.
Bringing him in this late.

Hey, we got parents buying
tickets, getting rooms.

What are we
supposed to tell them?

And with one of us
going home as it is?

l don't have to ask where
you stand on this, huh , Rizzo?

This wasn't Rizzo's idea.

You want me to say
l'm scared of getting cut?

l'm scared of getting cut.
Everybody is.

We just want it to be fair.

Don't even try telling me that.
He was in Colorado.

That was 6 months ago.

You don't think he's been
playing for the last 6 months?

-Not with us, he hasn't.
-So?

-So there's a difference.
-Like hell there is!

All l know is that kid
can flat-out play.

We can't?

He moves the puck, he's got
great vision on the ice.

That's not the point!

l'll tell you
something else he's got.

He's got the attitude l want
on and off the ice,

so somebody better explain to me

why l shouldn't be
giving him a look.

Because we're a family.

What?

We're a family.

A family?

Yeah .

Yeah .

And this is the family you want
to go to Lake Placid with?

Definitely.

-Yeah , without a doubt.
-Absolutely.

Wouldn't have it any other way.

Timmy Harrer can help us, boys.

And l'm gonna send him home.

We got one more
to get down to 20.

You understand .

Yep.

Looks like you got
yourself a team .

Almost.

-Let's talk about it.
-The rules.

Well , your girl left these
at my place.

With some milk and cookies.

Give her a hug for me.

You guys are unbelievable.

Real funny, guys.

Hey, boys.

We still got
two more presents to open up.

Yeah .

Pardon me, Coach .

Yeah?

Coach Patrick, from the boys.

Oh .

Here we go.

l thought you forgot.

''To Craig .''

That's beautiful , boys.

-You're gonna like this one.
-What?

That's very good .

That's very good .

-Perfect.
-Again !

-Again !
-[ Whistle blows ]

All right.
That's enough of that.

lt's going back in the box.

And , Herb.

Merry Christmas from the boys.

Drumroll , please.

Coach .

Ah , yes.

The gift that keeps on giving .

No.

No.

Speech .

Speech .

-''Ayatollah .''
-Speech .

Speech .

Well , this may come as a shock
to some of you guys,

but l'm not really very good
at giving sentimental speeches.

-No?
-You're kidding?

Come on .

l don't think
l should start tonight.

Hey, thanks
for having me over, Velta.

Good night, Herb.

-Doc, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Herb.

You guys have a great holiday.

TOGETHER:
Merry Christmas, Coach .

Merry Christmas, Coach .

Play some football !

WOMAN : By many
as the most important speech

of President Carter's term .

A look back now as 830 WCCO's
year-end special continues.

PRESlDENT CARTER: The erosion
of our confidence in the future

is threatening to destroy

the social and the political
fabric of America.

The confidence that we have
always had as a people

is not simply
some romantic dream

or a proverb in a dusty book

that we read
just on the Fourth of July.

lt is the idea
which founded our nation

and has guided
our development as a people.

Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

We've always believed in
something called ''progress.''

We've always had a faith
that the days of our children

will be better than our own .

Our people are losing
that faith .

For the first time
in the history of our country,

a majority of our people believe
that the next five years

will be worse than
the past five years.

We were taught that our armies
were always invincible,

and our causes were always just,

only to suffer
the agony of Vietnam .

We respected the presidency
as a place of honor

until the shock of Watergate.

We've got to stop crying
and start sweating .

Stop talking and start walking .

Working together
with our common faith .

We cannot fail .

-Yeah .
-Hard workout.

Silk, you guys want to
grab something to eat?

Yeah , l'm starving .
Where you guys gonna go?

Maybe that Mario's place.

Mario's?

Hey, Coach .

Coxie.

Herb wants to see you .

[ Knock on door ]

Come in .

Coach Patrick
said you wanted to see me.

Why don't you have
a seat there, Ralph?

Well , there's just
no easy way of doing this.

The rules say that we gotta
be down to 20 men ,

and right now we're at 2 1 .

l wish like hell
l could keep you , Ralph .

l do.

Yeah .

Yeah , l know.

You're a hell of
a hockey player.

This doesn't change that.

Thanks.

Well . . .

Thanks for giving me
a shot, Coach .

Thanks for giving me
your very best.

[ Paper tears ]

[ Telephone rings ]

-Yeah?
-Herb, Walter.

Well , you've got your wish .

Brezhnev's telling Carter
to screw himself.

Yeah , Walter, how's that?

The Kremlin just released
a statement today

saying they're gonna prove
how good they are

by beating us over here
on our own ice.

They're all gonna play.

The Soviets, the Czechs,
the whole bunch of them .

Have you got your roster
finalized yet?

Yeah , l got my team .

Well , l still don't know
why you scheduled this, Herb,

but get your guys to New York.

They've got a game to play.

# <i>Oh, say does that</i>
<i>star-spangled banner yet wave</i> #

# <i>O'er the land of the free</i> #

# <i>And the home of the brave?</i> #

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen ,
your 1 980 U .S . Olympic Team .

-[ Air horn blares ]
-[ Cheering ]

MAN : And so, as we await
the opening face-off

in this game between
the Soviet Union and Team USA

at Madison Square Garden ,

the teams line up
on their respective blue lines.

And Soviet Union team captain
Boris Mikhailov

skating over to his bench

to pick up
that NHL Challenge trophy.

The trophy that his team won

here at Madison Square Garden
last October,

and won in decisive fashion ,
beating the NHL All-Stars.

Getting a mixed reaction from
the capacity audience here.

Some cheers, but a few boos
going through the crowd as well .

And now the two teams
clear the ice

and repair
to their respective goals

as we get set
for the opening face-off

in this final tune-up
for these two teams

before the Olympic Games
in Lake Placid .

[ Speaking Russian ]

1 , 2 , 3.

TOGETHER:
USA!

MAN : And as we get set to drop
the puck for this contest,

the Soviets starting
their big line

of Mikhailov between
Kharlamov and Petrov.

Team USA countering
with Mark Johnson at center

between McClanahan
and Dave Silk.

And we're ready to go
with this warm-up contest.

Want to go hard , boys?

PETRO V:
Here!

lt's the Soviet Union
in control ,

making a charge
into the Team USA zone.

Corner!
Move it out!

And in behind the Team USA net.

Puck bounced back
to the blue line.

Moving in with a shot,

stopped by Jimmy Craig ,
and it goes into the corner.

Finally Team USA
gets its stick on the puck

as Ramsey brings it up
to the blue line.

He's absolutely flattened there
by Kasatonov.

HERB:
Two-on-one!

Team Soviet Union turning it
into a two-on-one.

Back door, O.C. , look out!

Get the puck!

Moving in to the boards,
shoots and scores.

Come on !

Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

That's it.
Let's go.

That's a nice expression
on your face.

Let's get it back, boys.

Get it back!

HERB:
Jack, you gotta listen to me!

You gotta listen to me!
