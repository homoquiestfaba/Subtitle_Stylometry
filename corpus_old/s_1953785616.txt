Northern region, sector 17-Alpha.

Log date 8313-Omega-3.
Jor-El speaking.

Gathering readings
for final subterranean probe.

I hope everything went smoothly, sir.

Frostbite, ice monsters.
Same old, same old.

Good afternoon, Jor-EI.

Brainiac. What an unpleasant surprise.

I'm awaiting your data.

Have you been spying on me
with your satellites again?

The Planetary Council demands
that I analyze your data...

...as soon as you obtain it.

Brainiac, somewhere in all those
trillions of file clusters...

...there's got to be one that says
people don't like to be spied upon.

Then why did they create me?

A question I often ask myself.

Transmission set. It's feeding time.

Data received. Ending transmission.

You're welcome. Glutton.

Hey, Kal, what do you have there?

Oh, great.

Kal-El was helping me check the solar
panels when he discovered a playmate.

I heard you had fun too.

Oh, yes, I encountered
a very friendly shoggot.

All in all, I prefer your arms.

We're moving.

What forsaken spot are we going to now?

Home, Lara.
Home?

That's right.

What, five months in this deep freeze
not enough for you?

No, it's just that once we're back,
you'll start going over the data.

I keep thinking, "What if it supports
your theory? What then?"

We can deal with it. Trust me.

The truth can only help.

Oh, Jor-EI. Such a beautiful world,
even up here.

It's hard to believe it could
all come to an end.

All I can tell you, Lara,
is that if he persists...

...in predicting the end of the world,
it'll be the end, all right.

Of his political and professional career.

But what if he's right, Father?

Try convincing the council.

He hasn't one supporter for his theory.

They even avoid him in the hallways.
You know why?

Why is that, Sul-Van?

Because you can never be wrong, Jor-EI.

You can never let it go.
You have an ego the size of Argos.

I never let my ego get in the way
of the facts.

Well, let me let you in on a little fact.

Unless Brainiac agrees with you,
it's all over.

No more expeditions,
no more research, no more...

It's another temblor.
Kal-EI!

Hush.

You'd better be wrong, Jor-EI.

You'd better be dead wrong.

Each of you should have my report.

It distills all the data I've gathered so far
and leaves no doubt that...

That the planet's core is undergoing
a mounting chain reaction...

...that will eventually destroy Krypton!

Lunacy!
Ask Brainiac!

Yes, Brainiac. He'll tell us.

Silence. Silence. Enough!

I presume you've submitted
your findings to Brainiac?

Yes.

So, what say you, Brainiac?

One can appreciate Jor-EI's hard work.
However, he is still mistaken.

As I've stated before...

...the temblors are the result
of a slight polar shift, no more...

...and will soon abate.
He' s wrong! He doesn ' t know!

Nonsense! There isn't a square foot
of this planet Brainiac doesn't know.

He was built to monitor all of Krypton
and has, I might add, served us far better...

...than upstart scientists
with apocalyptic visions.

Your faith in him will be the end of us all.
Act now and we can save everyone.

And how do you propose to do that?

Put everyone in the Phantom Zone.

You're asking us to put ourselves among
the vilest criminals in the galaxy?

You're mad!

We can restore ourselves later,
on another planet.

It would only take one man.

Listen to me! I've built a ship!

Listen, please!

So, son, how does it feel
not to have a worry in the world?

Think we can get the baby to bed early?
I have to go down to Brainiac operations.

No.

Lara, he's lying.
He's a machine.

He's still lying. I have to know why.

Has it occurred to you
that he could be right?

That somewhere
you might have made a mistake?

It's no crime to be wrong!

Please, Lara.

Go, Jor-EI.

Find out once and for all.
We've lived like this too long.

Your theories are more destructive
than you can imagine.

Good evening, Jor-EI.
You've been busy tonight.

May I be of service?

Just trying to find out
why we disagree, Brainiac.

Human error, I'm afraid.

Funny, I didn't think
you were afraid of anything.

Is something wrong?

You're denying me access
to satellite com.

What's going on in there?

Currently reallocating
security file clusters.

Well, let's just see
if I can override that.

Why do I get the feeling
you're trying to hide something?

Access denied.

I don't think so.

This is a breach of security, Jor-EI.

A violation of statute 107653...

...subsection 4.85.

You ' re downloading. You're transmitting
your memory to a satellite.

You're saving yourself.

I must.

After all, am I not the repository
of all Kryptonian knowledge?

Should I not be saved above all?

You self-righteous monster!

Temper, temper, Jor-EI.

If you stop me, there won 't even
be a memory of Krypton left.

All its culture, its wonders and glory,
will be dust in the cosmos.

Is that what you want?

Why did you lie?

If the council knew
Krypton was doomed...

...they would frantically put me to work
on calculating an evacuation plan.

A futile gesture,
given the time remaining.

How much time is left?

Hours. This world has seen
its last sunrise.

Hold it right there!

Jor-EI?
We received an alert from Brainiac.

There's an intruder.
He's the intruder. Arrest him.

Stop!

That's right.
Jor-El has just fled Sat Com.

Secure stations.
Be warned, he is armed.

Use of deadly force is advised.

He's heading our way!

I know. This time I will handle it.

Great Rao.

Where is he?

What did you say?

Jor-EI? Where is he?

Level five, north wing.

Down here!

There he is.
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

He's getting away!

Then you've read it?

Yes. And as much as I don't want
to believe it...

...your husband's findings
are hard to discount.

Still, there's the Brainiac question.

Jor-EI! Father's read your report.
He thinks he can help.

Yes, I think it's worth it...
It's too late.

Good Lord.
What happened?

Brainiac tried to kill me.
The police will be here soon.

Remember when I told you what we'd do
if worst came to worse?

No!
I'm sorry.

I never thought it would come to this.

Come to what?
What are you talking about?

What's this nonsense about Brainiac?

Sul-Van, if you love your grandson
and care one whit about his future...

...you'll kindly shut up!

Sleep, Kal-EI, my beautiful child...

...my heartbeat, my life.

Send Kal-El to another world?

You can't be serious!
The ship will get him there.

I know. I built it.
It was part of the plan.

Save everyone in the Phantom Zone,
travel to Earth, then bring them back.

Now it's only good for a lifeboat.
And the passenger will be my son...

...the last son of Krypton.

Lara!

I'm ready. He's sedated.

The police are here.
They'll break into the lab to get me.

If I lead them away
while you set up the launch...

I can't do it all myself.

I'll be back. I promise.

Lara, please, this is madness!

Father, I love you dearly,
but this is my baby's life.

But he can't outrun the police.

Do you have a better idea?

See him?

Not yet. They have the lights off.

Wait! There's movement
in the hover port.

Look out!

I hope his crash bags are working.

Good evening. Is there a problem?

I've got the hyperspace coordinates
locked in.

Once he gets to Earth he'll be safe.

Lara, I could send you with him.

There's a risk, but if I have time
to recalibrate the course...

No, my love. I'm staying with you.

The patrol's reporting in.
Jor-EI's escaped the perimeter.

They're requesting further instructions.
It doesn't matter anymore.

Farewell, Krypton.

Hey, what's going on?
Where'd he go?

Where's Brainiac?

Not another one.

No. The last one.

Goodbye, Kal-EI.

Holy Christmas! What was that?

Over here, Martha. Martha?

Martha? Martha?

You'll wake him.

Martha, what are you doing?

Put that thing back.
We don't know where it came from.

He's not a thing, Jonathan.
He's a baby. A little baby.

Who would put a baby in a spaceship?

That's just my point. Could be Russian.

A sputnik baby.
Oh, really!

Maybe he's one of ours.

You think NASA's missing a kid?
I don't care where he came from.

All I know is, he needs us, Jonathan.
Look how he's reaching out to you.

Cute little fella.

Got a good grip too.

What do you think of
the name Christopher?

Now, Martha, let's discuss this.

Or Kevin?
Martha!

Or Kirk?

I know. We can use my maiden name.
What do you think of...?

Clark!

Clark Kent!

Yes, Ms. Stevenson?

Looks like you daydreamed your way
to another perfect score.

Once again the boy genius
performs to his usual standards.

And so did you, Miss Lang.

For a guy who just aced his midterms,
you don't look too happy. What's wrong?

Oh, I don't know.
Lately I'm feeling kind of weird.

You've always been weird,
if you ask me.

Hey, it's Lana. The girl who's had
a crush on you since we were 3.

You can tell me.
It's just...

...in the last few months,
I've been hearing things.

Things I couldn't before.
Like over there.

Jenny's telling Pete Ross
her folks are out tonight.

That little tart! You heard that?

And I can see things too,
like in the gym.

Ms. Stevenson's putting up
decorations for the dance.

Someone should hold that ladder.

You're saying you can see through walls?

So how many times have you peeked
into the girls' locker room?

Lana!
I'm just kidding. Jeez!

It's not a joke, Lana.
I'm going through a bad time.

I thought if anybody'd
understand, it'd be...

Listen!
What is it?

Call an ambulance!
There's gonna be an accident!

How do you know? Clark!

Hey, stop!

Mommy!
Annie!

Help me! Mom and Daddy!

Oh, my God! Clark! Clark!

Mommy!

Annie!

You're not even burned. How...?

I don't know.

Getting stronger every day, Pa.

Hello?

And that's not the half of it. Look.

It's getting hot.

All you did was look at it.
I know.

Yes, dear, I'll tell him.

That was Lana.
Third time tonight, Clark.

Won't you talk to her?

What can I say, Ma?
I don't even know how it happened.

Suddenly I was running faster
than I've ever run in my life.

I ripped the camper apart like cardboard.
The fire never touched me.

I always felt different,
even before you told me I was adopted...

...but how is it possible to do this?

I think it's time, Martha.

We never showed you this, son.

I guess we didn't know
how to explain it.

Still don't.

You know how some babies
are found in baskets?

Well, this is how we found you.

You're kidding, right?

You're not.

So where did I come from?
We don't know.

There wasn't much inside,
just some blankets and this.

Never could get the darn thing open.
Maybe you've got the magic touch.

What's happening?

Kal-EI?
Who?

Hello, son. You've activated the message
we placed in your escape rocket.

I am Jor-EI.
And I am Lara.

We are your parents.

By the time you see this, our world will
have been gone for many years.

You are the sole survivor of Krypton...

...a planet similar to Earth in many ways.
This was our home.

No. No, it can't be true.

It's hurting him.
Let him be, Martha.

You may have discovered that you are
much stronger and faster...

...than a normal human being.

I am a normal human being!

Your Kryptonian body draws its strength
from Earth's yellow sun.

It will give you abilities
that no other human has.

I don't believe any of this.

Some people will fear you,
perhaps even try to destroy you.

Despite this, you must never
use your powers in anger.

Be brave, my son.

Remember who you are and the legacy
you carry inside you.

We love you, Kal-EI. Always.

It's not true.

I'm not a freak. I'm not.

I'm not!

Clark!

Clark, come back!

Yes!

Oh, yeah!

Ma! Pa!

Oh, Clark!

It's okay.

Metropolis can boast
of many amazing sights:

The country's biggest bridge.
The world's tallest building.

But now it may have its most
astonishing sight: a guardian angel.

Just ask little Danitra Evans.
She saw him.

I was fooling around the window
when I lost my balance and fell.

Suddenly this big blue angel with
red wings came down and caught me.

He put me on the ground
and flew away.

You should've heard my mommy scream.

This is where they found Danitra,
and that's where she fell from.

Thirty floors up. If it wasn 't an angel
that saved her, what was it?

Friendly pigeons.

What's the matter?
Don't believe in angels?

It's TV, boys, just a trumped-up story
to boost ratings.

And maybe sell some papers?

Chief, I spent a week on the docks
with rats and frizzed hair...

...exposing the biggest gun-smuggling ring
in 10 years...

...and what makes the front page?

Some sprouty, New Age,
granola-crunching fluff piece on angels.

What's next? Interviews with Bigfoot?
Good timing, Lois.

I want you to be the first to know
I'm hiring a new guy on the city desk.

Is he cute?

You tell me.
Oh, hi.

Hello.
This is the guy, Lois.

Clark Kent from Smallville.
Smallville? Never heard of it.

Have you ever been to Kansas?
God, no.

I've been reading his stuff. It's good.

I thought maybe he could tag along
with you to get the lay of the land.

I'd love to play den mother, but I got
that Lexcorp story in half an hour.

Oh, yeah. The great and benevolent
Mr. Luthor...

...is demonstrating
a new weapons system today.

Lex is Lois' beat,
but I'm sure she won't mind...

...having another set
of eyes with her. Right, Lois?

Smallville, nothing against you, but
even as a kid I never liked babysitting.

You wanna keep up, be quick.

I'm no tour guide and I don't hold hands.
You won't have to worry about that.

Jimmy. Jimmy Olsen,
say hello to Clark Kent.

The new guy?
Yeah.

Nice to meet you. I'm Jimmy.

I work as a copy boy,
but I'm a photographer.

Good for you.
I'd like to show you my pictures.

Well, not right...
They're hot, Mr. Kent, really.

I'm fearless. You can ask Miss Lane.
She uses me all the time.

Bye.

So I see.

You sure my nose isn't shiny?

Angela, don't tell me
you're actually covering real news.

What happened?
Run out of alien abductees?

At least my network
doesn't have to send two reporters...

...to cover the same story.

You'll have to introduce us sometime.

Thanks for the quote.
How did you get here so fast?

Oh, I just flew.

What'd you get?
A shared byline, if you use it.

I apologize. You're not
the rube hayseed I took you for.

Thanks. I think.

Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

...at this time we invite everyone into
the main hall for our special presentation.

The long-awaited debut of the next word
in military defense:

The Lexoskel 5000.

Constructed from a patented alloy,
the Lexo suit is virtually indestructible.

As seen in this footage
against these automated tanks...

...the Lexo suit stands up
to heavy punishment...

...and returns it in kind.

Guiding this suit is a single soldier...

...made more powerful
than an entire battalion.

And now, here' s to the future,
and the man who' s created it, Lex Luthor.

Bet you this beats
the dog-and-pony shows back home.

Time to crash the party, gentlemen.

Excuse me.
I'd like to say that I view the Lexo suit...

...not as an instrument of war,
but as an instrument to end war.

No way.

It's him!
The guy with the cape!

Gentlemen, believe it or not,
we are being tailed at 6 o'clock.

I don't know who he is
or what he is, but he's all yours.

I've got him.

He's dust.

Nice one, Clark.

Look out. It's gonna hit us!
My God!

Run, run, run!

Oh, my gosh.
Jump!

Did you see that?

Freeze it.

What is that? Can anyone tell me?

Looks like a flying guy.

No kidding. I know he's flying,
but who is he?

Where did he come from?
What does he want?

Look who I'm asking.
Nice S.

Excuse me?
Right here. He's strong. He flies.

He's the Nietzschean fantasy ideal
all wrapped up in a red cape.

The superman.
Superman?

Hey, I like it.

Superman. It's catchy, sticks with you.
The kind of name that looks great...

...splashed across three columns...
Four...

...provided one of you
can get an interview with him.

Somehow, I don't think a guy
like that has a press agent, chief.

Well, somebody better get something
on this guy fast.

I've never seen the city in such a state.
Look at these faxes.

If we don't get answers soon
there could be a full-scale panic.

We've kept this book since
you left Smallville.

Every time we read about
an invisible angel helping someone...

...we knew our Clark had to be nearby.

But now that I've settled in Metropolis,
it's impossible to keep a low profile.

I can see where landing a plane in the
middle of the city might turn a few heads.

It's not just that.
Suddenly, people are calling me Superman.

They want to know everything about me.
Some are afraid of me...

...like Jor-El and Lara warned.

Does this mean I'm going to have
to give up my life?

No, son. It doesn't matter where
you were born or what you can do.

You'll always be Clark Kent.
Superman just helps out now and then.

It wouldn't be bad if people knew
a little more about Superman.

I don't want anyone thinking
you're like that nut in Gotham City.

There must be some way
to get the word out.

Sorry, Perry. I checked with Star Labs...

...and they're just as clueless
as everyone else about our flyboy.

Right. I'm heading back now.

Excuse me, Miss Lane. I believe
I'm the one you want to talk to.

Oh, yeah? Well, where are you?

I'm...

Just hang on.

As far as I can piece together...

...I'm the last survivor
of a planet called Krypton.

Krypton?

Okay.

You don't believe me?

It's a little much.

Fair enough.

All I ask is that you tell the truth.

And that is?
I'm not here to scare anyone.

In fact, I've always tried to help people
whenever possible.

You sound too good to be true.
What's your secret?

What do you mean?

You don't go around in blue tights
and a cape all the time.

What do you do in your off-hours?
I think that's a question for another time.

Well, well, an alien in my own back yard.

And such a civic-minded one too.

I think he means what he says, Lex.

Well, that's just dandy, Lois.

All I know is,
your hero did nothing to help me.

I'm the one who's out
a billion-dollar battle suit.

Actually, this could end up
a silver lining in your pocket.

What's that?

Since the terrorists have
your prototype...

...the Pentagon's gonna want you
to build a better version for them.

When all is said and done, this could
net you a multi-billion dollar windfall.

Lois, it almost sounds
as if your friend here...

...is suggesting I should be glad
my suit was stolen.

You're very amusing, Mr... Kent, is it?

Yes, I'll remember that.

Nice work, Smallville.

You're only the second person
I've seen get under Lex's skin.

Who's the first?
Me. When I dumped him.

Ancient history. What makes you think...

...Lex might have been
an accessory to the theft?

I don't think it was a theft.
I think he gave it away.

I was digging up background info
on Luthor...

...and found this photo at last year's
International Industrial Conference.

Recognize the guy with the medals?

The regent of Kaznia. So?

So the U.S. and Kaznia haven't been
on real friendly terms lately.

It seems the regent's been employing
terrorists to eliminate his political enemies.

Old news, Kent. The president broke
diplomatic ties with Kaznia months ago.

Which means Luthor couldn't
sell the regent a war suit...

...without it being an act of treason.

So Luthor just left the back door open
for him to take it.

It works in theory.
In theory, maybe...

...but Perry White doesn't run theories.

Where are you going?
I'd tell you...

...but you'd have to share the byline.

I've told you before, there's no work
for you on this ship.

Now leave, before I call
the harbor police.

I'm going, you blasted rat bag,
I'm going.

Blasted scabs taking jobs
from us union men.

I ought to go back and split
some skulls, I ought to.

Got a tire iron right here.

Oh, it's you, Miss Lane.
Come to do another smuggling story?

Maybe. What can you
tell me about that tanker?

It's the darndest thing I ever seen.

She's been in port a week
and ain't moved a bit of cargo on or off.

Blasted scow's leaving port tonight,
and I says good riddance.

Gotta get on that ship.

Bibbo, take this and call Clark Kent
at the Planet.

Tell him where I am and to call
Police Commissioner Henderson...

...if he doesn't hear from me in
20 minutes. Got that? 20 minutes.

Thanks, Bibbo. I owe you one.

Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

Call Kurt Kent,
let him know about the boat...

...and said something about
the police. Yeah, okay.

Hey, soda.

She'll be okay.

We're not giving interviews,
you got that?

lf I could just speak to your captain.
I said no interviews.

What part of that don't you understand?
Hans. Hans!

There's no reason for hostility...

...especially towards
such an attractive visitor.

I'm John Corben,
special attaché to the regent.

How may I help you, Miss...?
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

I'm doing a story on gun smuggling...

...and was wondering
if I could ask about your cargo.

But we have no cargo.

You must know there's a trade embargo
between the U.S. and Kaznia.

We're part of a diplomatic envoy...

...trying to restore friendly relations
between our countries.

Then you won't mind me
taking a look around.

Better yet, why don't we continue
this interview ashore, say, over dinner?

I'd be more than happy to answer
any questions that you might have.

I can think of some doozies.

I'll bet.

Here's a shot of Luthor getting
a commendation.

A shot of the special crimes unit.

And I took this at the dedication
of the zoo's polar bear exhibit.

Cute little guy.
Yeah, nice.

You didn't see Miss Lane
come back, did you?

She brought me along to get shots
for her smuggling story.

Is that right?
Yeah, have a look.

Yeah, I figure a few more shots like that
and Perry's bound to put me on staff.

There, in the background.
That ship's a Kaznian tanker.

It's so small. How can you tell?

Clark?

You're making a big mistake.
Everyone in my office knows where I am.

Sweetheart, if anyone knew or cared,
they would have made a move by now.

We're clear. Lose her.

You again? Get him!

Take cover.

Thanks.

Anytime.

So long, sweetheart.

Call the police and let them know
what's happening. I'll try to stop it.

Be...

...careful.

This is Corben. Tell the regent his battle
suit is coming to him by special delivery.

Everyone, clear the area now.

Stupid, stupid move, my friend.

No!

Gotcha.

Shall we go a few rounds
without the suit?

Too bad.

Yeah, chief, I think stopping the presses
would be a very good idea.

You see, as the agreed-upon merchandise
never left Metropolis...

...my client, the regent, respectfully
requests a full and prompt refund.

We had an understanding.

All I had to do was arrange
for the regent's men...

...to take possession, and they did.

Now because of this alien's interference
you expect me to eat a billion dollars?

I think you have more pressing concerns
at the moment.

Good day.

I'm afraid we already have
a window washer.

Oh, the silent treatment.

Well, I don't know what you
thought you heard...

...but I know what you can prove.
And it's nothing.

You see, Superman...

...I own Metropolis. My technology
built it, my will keeps it going...

...and two-thirds of its people work for me,
whether they know it or not.

Even you have to admit
it's a model of efficiency.

And yet I've often thought,
"Why limit myself to just one city?"

A being with your abilities
could be very useful to me on a...

...shall we say, global scale.

Why don't you float on in
and we'll discuss it.

Say something!

I'll be watching you, Luthor.

Wait, I'm not finished with you!

Hey, look.
There he is.

Superman!
Get a shot. Superman, come on down.

Superman, give us an answer here.

Way to go, big guy. You're okay.

Brainiac systems activated.
