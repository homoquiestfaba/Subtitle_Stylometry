THUNDER RUMBLES

HORSE WHINNIES

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa, whoa!

Silence in court!

Now we come, not for the first
time, to Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

Yes, Mr Tangle?

As we know, m'lud, the problem
with which we grapple in the case
of Jarndyce and Jarndyce

is that there are several wills
and fragments of wills,

all of them different,
all of them conflicting.

Is there much more
of this, Mr Tangle?

Afraid there is. . .
a variety of points.

I feel it my duty to submit. . .
Ludship.

Mr Brownlow, you appear
for Lady Dedlock in this matter.
Do you have any matters of urgency?

Er. . . No, m'lud. Ah.

I see that Mr Tulkinghorn has graced
us with his presence this morning.

M'lud.

THUNDERCLAP

Is it still raining, my love?

Yes, my love. Remarkable.

And I am bored to death with it.
Ah, well. . .

Bored to death with this place,

bored to death with my life,

(bored to death with myself. )

What was that, my love?

Nothing. . .

of consequence.

Mr Tulkinghorn will be coming soon.

Certain legal matters
to discuss, he says.

Perhaps there's been a development
in Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

Nothing ever happens with
Jarndyce and Jarndyce. No, well. . .

JUDGE: Now, somewhat to my surprise,

something stirs in Jarndyce.

It appears that the two young
people, the wards of court

who stand at the very
centre of these proceedings,

are with us today.

My lord, you were to hear my
case today! Gridley, my lord.

Silence in court! Gridley.

I have a right to be heard, my lord.
I have waited long enough.

Quiet, sir, quiet. Keep it down.

An application has been made for
them to reside with their cousin -

a Mr John Jarndyce.

Will your lordship allow me?

The two young people are here,
my lord.

And there is a third young person, my lord.
A third young person?
Not another ward in court?

No, m'lud. Engaged as companion
to this young lady, and seeking
your lordship's approval.

Very well. Is she here, too?

On her way, m'lud.

Miss Barbary. . .

will you tell me, who am I, exactly?

Who are you?

You're nobody. You're nothing.
You're worse than nothing.

It would have been far better
if you'd never been born. Why?

Is it because of my mother?

Did she die because of me?

Your mother, Esther,
is your disgrace. . .

 .and you hers.

You're different
from other children, Esther.

YOU are set apart.

THUNDER STRIKES, HORSE WHINNIES

MEN CRY OUT

Miss Esther Summerson? My name is
Guppy, Miss, of Kenge and Carboys.

Allow me, Miss.

There. Here we are.

Bring down Miss Summerson's
box and follow us, my man.

Now, will you take me arm, Miss?

We don't wanna lose ya, do we, Miss?

DOG BARKS, VOICES CRY OUT

Oh! Have a care there, sir.
I do beg your pardon.

I beg your pardon.

Are you all right?
Quite all right, thank you.

Then no harm done.

Good day to you.

Good day, sir.

Well, Jo, how are you?

You know me, sir. I never vary.

I've nothing to give you now, Jo,

but I'll look out
for you on my way back.

You're very good, sir.

SHOP DOOR BELL RINGS

All in order, Mr Nemo.

Very elegantly done,
if I may say so.

There'll be another parcel
of documents to copy
tomorrow if you want it.

Jarndyce and Jarndyce
makes work for us all, eh?

Careful how you spend it now.

What's it to you
how I spend it, Mr Snagsby?
Nothing at all, I'm sure, Mr Nemo.

Good day to you.

DOOR CREAKS OPEN

Here we are, Miss Summerson.

This is Mr Kenge's room.

Er, take this armchair by the
fire, if you will. Thank you.

Mr Kenge is in court now.

He left his compliments and would
you partake of some refreshment,
and look over the paper if you will.

Oh, thank you, Mr. . . Guppy.

Thank you, Mr Guppy.
Oh, not at all, Miss, I'm sure.

You're going before
the Chancellor, I hear.

A claimant in Jarndyce
and Jarndyce, I dare say?

I don't know. I don't think so.

But Mr John Jarndyce. . .
There. . . Mr John Jarndyce. You see?

He's right at the heart of the case,
and it is a very great case,
Miss Summerson.

The most famous case in Chancery.

Gone on for many years.

Some say it will never be settled,
and a great deal of money
depends on it, Miss Summerson.

Hundreds  of thousands.
Millions, some say.

I have heard of it, Mr Guppy,
but I don't understand it at all.

It's  about a will, Miss.
Or a number of 'em.

A long time ago, a man named Jarndyce
made a great fortune, but he seems
to have made more than one will.

So, no-one knows
who should get the money,

and it's been in dispute ever since.

There are lots of claimants,
and the claims get passed
down through the generations.

There's two young people appeared in
court today and they are at the heart
of it, like your Mr John Jarndyce.

They say one of 'em may get the lot,
but you never know.

You may have a claim yourself,
Miss Summerson, if Mr Jarndyce
has sent for you.

And, may I say, I wish you the very
best of good fortune, Miss Summerson.

Thank you, Mr Guppy.

Er, you see there's a
looking-glass there on the wall?

Yes? In case you should want to look
at yourself after the journey, as
you're going before the Chancellor.

Er, not that it's
requisite, I'm sure.

It's very much to the
contrary, if I may say so.

Oh, no. Oh.

Mortifying.

(Mortifying. )

It's only an ink-stain,
is it not, Mr Guppy?

That must be a regular hazard,
I would have thought,
in your line of business.

Don't upset yourself, I beg you.

You're very kind, Miss Summerson.

Kinder than I could have. . .

Miss Summerson.

Ah, Mr Kenge. Miss Summerson.

Shall we go before the Chancellor?

Mortifying.

Miss Clare? Miss Ada Clare?

Well, well. You are
a ward of court, Miss Clare.

Do you know what that means?
I'm not sure that I do, sir.

You and Mr Carstone, both being
orphaned, you have been placed
under the jurisdiction of the court.

As claimants in the case,
as direct descendents of the
original John Jarndyce

of Bleak House in Hertfordshire,
now long deceased,

you may inherit a very great
deal of money,

one or both of you,
when this case is settled.

In the meantime, your cousin,
also called John Jarndyce,

also residing at Bleak House,
has undertaken to take care of you.

Are you willing to go to
Bleak House, Miss Clare? Yes, sir.

It sounds dreary to me.

Not dreary at present, my lord.

Mr Richard Carstone? Yes, my lord.

Do you think that you will be
happy under the roof of Mr
John Jarndyce of Bleak House?

I'm sure I shall, my lord.

Though  you have never met him?

Hmm.

Mr John Jarndyce is a man
of good character, I suppose?

Of excellent character and high
standing in the community, my lord.

He has the means to look
after these two young people?

No matter what the outcome
of the case, he is a man
of considerable means.

Is he married?

He is not, my lord.

Hmm. If I might remind your
lordship, Mr Jarndyce provides a
suitable companion for Miss Clare.

This is the young lady,
Miss Summerson.

I see.

Very well.

I shall make the order.

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Well, what a day this has been.

Only yesterday, on the old school
bench construing Latin verses,

today I'm Mr Richard Carstone,
heir to a fortune.

So where do we go
next, Miss Summerson?

Don't YOU know? Not in the least.

We're like the babes in the wood.

Have you known each other very long?
Not very long.

We met each other half an hour
before we met you, Esther, but
we're the best of friends already.

I'm sure all three of us shall be.
Oh! The wards in Jarndyce.

Very happy, I'm sure,
to have the honour.

It's a good omen for youth
and hope and beauty

to find themselves in this place and
not know what's to come of it.

I was a ward myself, you know.

Of course, my case was
nothing like so grand as yours,

but I expect a judgement shortly,
on the Day of Judgement.

Now don't be troublesome,
Miss Flite, there's a good soul.

Ah, here's your cab. You're to lodge
with Mrs Jellyby tonight.

A good soul, and a great
philanthropist. Guppy will take you.

Ah, yes, indeed.

Well, Miss Clare and Mr Carstone.

Miss Summerson.

Up we go. We all in?

Off we go, driver.

Walk on.

Clamb?

Fetch the Jarndyce documents.

Going down to Chesney Wold, sir?

Mmm. A fine house, I understand, sir.

Very fine house, very great family.

A great privilege to serve
Sir Leicester Dedlock, Clamb.

And Lady Dedlock, sir.

A great beauty in her day, sir.

Mmm, a beauty.

Not from a great family,
but a beauty, as you say.

That's the world.

Fetch the papers, Clamb.
Right you are, Mr Tulkinghorn.

CHILD CRIES

Mr Guppy, whatever's the matter?

Don't be frightened, Miss. One of
the young Jellybys has got
his head through the railings.

Oh, poor child. Oh, never fear.

I'll pull him out, Miss Summerson.

Oh. Move. 'Ere y'are.

CHILD WAILS

No go. I'll try again.

Mr Guppy! Mr Guppy. Would it not be
better to push?

Where his head will go,
the rest of him will follow.

Oh, excellent thought,
Miss Summerson.

Gently, don't be frightened.

Er, wriggle your
shoulder a little bit sideways.

CHILD CONTINUES TO WAIL

There, that's it. There, we got him!

DOOR OPENS

Ah, Miss Clare. Miss Summerson.

Mr  Carstone.
Do, please, come inside.

This way, my dears.
You find me, as usual, very busy.

My Africa project
employs my whole time.

THUD, FOLLOWED BY CHILD CRYING

We hope by this time next
year to have 200 families

cultivating coffee, and educating
the natives of Borrioboola-Gha.

Great work, great work.

My husband, Mr Jellyby,
does not appear to be here.

But here is my eldest
daughter Caddy, my amanuensis.

Do please sit while I, er. . .

Where were we, Caddy?

I'm sure YOUR thoughts have often
turned to Africa, Miss Summerson.

The finest climate in the world.
Caddy?

Mrs Jellyby presents her
compliments to Mrs Swallow. . .

Ma. Now what is it?

No, Peepy, not on any account.

Mama is busy.

You, Mrs Swallow, I know,
share my deeply held conviction

about Africa, the essential
Brotherhood of Humanity,

and it is with this understanding. . .

I can't keep up, Ma. Go slower.

And. . .

it is with this understanding. . .

KNOCK AT DOOR

(May I come in for a minute? )

You've been working late.

No need to tell me that.

I wish Africa was dead.

Look at my fingers.
It won't come off.

She's very pretty. Yes, she is.

She's an orphan, ain't she?

Yes. I wish I was an orphan.

Ma's a disgrace. I wish I was dead.

I wish we were all dead. It would be
a great deal better for us.

Don't tell me it wouldn't,
it would. Caddy, I'm sure. . .

I'm so angry with Ma. She makes
such an ass of herself over Africa,
and Pa does nothing at all.

Really, Caddy, I don't think
you should speak of
your parents like that.

I  know I am a disgrace,
Miss Summerson.

I wish I'd had you to teach me
better manners, but I've got to
make the best of myself as I am.

You're shocked, I dare say.

Well, so am I.

I wish. . . Well, never mind.

Goodnight.

Here we are, my beauties!

Hope. Joy.

Youth. Ah. . .
SHE WHISTLES

Peace. Rest. Life.

Oooh, shh, shh, shh, shh. . .

Dust. Ashes. Waste.

Want. . .

Ruin, Despair.

Madness.

Death.

Cunning and Folly.

We shall all have a judgement
on the Day of Judgement.

Plunder, Precedent, Jargon,
Gammon and Spinach.

And then you shall sing to your
heart's content, my little ones.

SHE WHISTLES

BIRDS TWITTER

Oh!

SHE HUMS A TUNE

# And we'll all come to
judgement one day soon. #

Morning.
Off to court then, Miss Flite?

As you see, Mr Krook. And your rent?

Very soon, Mr Krook, very soon.

On the Day of Judgement, yeah?

Oh, long before then, I'm sure.

LOUD HISS
All right, Lady Jane?

She could tear a person
to tatters if I set her on.

D'you know, she was
sold to me for her skin.

It's a very fine one as you see.

Didn't have it in
me heart to skin her.

Not like the Court of Chancery, eh?

Not as long as I get what I'm owed.

Mr Krook,

I have met the wards in Jarndyce.

Wards in Jarndyce, is it?
Such beautiful creatures.

So full of youth and hope and beauty.
Oh, and they won't have it long.

That Jarndyce and
Jarndyce eats 'em all up.

It's like being ground
to bits in a slow mill.

It's being drowned by drips and
going mad by grains.

Look how poor Tom Jarndyce ended up.
Mr Krook, don't speak of it.

Come in my shop, right where
you stand, a pistol in his hand.

Please, Mr Krook.
SHOP DOOR BELL CLANGS

Oh!

Mr Nemo.

Good morning, Miss Flite.

Mr Krook.

Er, forgive me but I'm
rather pressed for time.

Rent, Mr Nemo. Six weeks.

As long as that?

Well, you shall have it.

Yeah, that's all very well,
but when?

You will be paid, Mr Krook.

You have my word.

Now. . .

 .excuse me.

Oh, he's such a gentleman.

A gentleman? That's no use to me.

Some people say that he
sold his soul to the devil.

But if he has, I don't know
what he done with the money!

My very best remembrances
to my good friend Mr Jarndyce.

You won't forget me,
will you, Miss Summerson?

Come, Caddy, we have work to do.

OK, driver.

Go on, move on.

We have a visitor.

Can you see who it is, my love?

Tulkinghorn. Ah.

Mr Tulkinghorn. Sir Leicester.

Good of you to
come all this way.

My lady's case has been again
before the Chancellor, has it? Yes.

It was on again yesterday, my lord.

My lady.

It would be useless to
ask, no doubt, whether
anything has been done.

Nothing that you would
call anything has been done.

Nor ever will be. Mmm.

Well, a long Chancery suit is very
much in the way of things, my dear.

Hardly be proper if it weren't.

Indeed, my lord. Now, as a few
fresh affidavits have been
put upon the file,

and as I proceed upon the principle
that my client

should be fully possessed of all the
new developments in the case. . .

All right, Mr Tulkinghorn.

I, er. . . I have the papers here,
if I might. . .

Thank you.

In Chancery, between John Jarndyce. . .
Mr Tulkinghorn, please.

Omit as many of the formal
horrors as you can.

As your ladyship pleases.

Who copied that?
Hmm? Whose handwriting is it?

I regret to say I have
no idea, my lady.

Is this what you call law-hand?

Why do you ask?

Anything to vary this
detestable monotony.

Oh, go on, do.

Very well. Er. . .

In the matter of the will, or wills,
of the aforesaid John Jarndyce. . .

My lady? What's the matter?

My dear, what is it?
What's the matter?

Lady Dedlock is ill, sir.

I'm just. . .faint.
Help Lady Dedlock to her room.

Careful. Careful, gently now.

Heat of the fire, perhaps.

Far too much for her.

I mean it! Nemo, no more excuses!

The money by tomorrow
or you're on the street!

COINS CLINK

Thank you, sir. Those papers I took
down to Lady Dedlock at Chesney Wold,
where were they copied?

That depends, Mr Tulkinghorn. They
came from several of our regulars.

Well, that one, for instance.

I'll check, sir.

It may take a while.
I have to compare the hand.

Thank you, Clamb.

Ada, my love. Esther, my dear.

You are welcome. I rejoice to see
you. Come inside and get warm.

Rick, if I had a hand to spare
at present, I'd give it to you.

Come in. Come in.

There. Now, make yourselves
comfortable, warm yourselves.

Now, Rick,
I have that hand at liberty.

A word in earnest is
as good as a speech.

I am heartily glad to see you.

You are at home.

You're very kind, sir.
We're much obliged to you.

Now, come and see your rooms.

I wish you'd come away
from the window, my love.

You must take care for your health.
We don't want you fainting again.

I am perfectly well.

You're still pale, I'm afraid.
Is it any wonder?

We have not see the sun for months.
Mmm.

I think I should take
you away for a while.

Paris, now.

A  change of scene that will
lighten both our spirits.

What do you say?

You are too good to me. No, no.

No, no, no.

Not at all.

D'you think we shall
be happy here, Esther?

I think we have been very fortunate.

Bleak House is not
so bleak after all.

And do you like Mr Jarndyce?

I think he is a very
singular man indeed.

Is that good? I hope so,
we are here now for good or ill.

Esther, why do you think
he's taken us into his care?

Well, perhaps it is
nothing but kindness.

He has made it very difficult
for us to ask, since he behaves
as if we are all old friends.

It is strange.

But perhaps we shall be good friends.

Do you think we shall, Esther?

I am sure we shall, Ada.

KNOCK AT DOOR
Yes?

Miss Summerson? For you, Miss, if
you please. The housekeeping keys.

The master said to
bring them to you,

then tomorrow morning I'm to
show you the presses
and the things they belong to.

For me?

Really?

Thank you. Er, and you are. . . ?

Harriet, Miss. Thank you, Harriet.

'You're nobody.'

You're nothing.
You're worse than nothing.

It would have been far better
if you'd never been born.

Esther, what is it? Nothing.

I'm surprised anyone should trust
me so much, knowing me so little.

Shall we go down?

As far as worldly matters are
concerned, I am but a child,
a perfect child.

Ah, our little party is complete.

Ada, Esther. . . Allow me to
introduce myself. Harold Skimpole.

A dear friend and house guest,
for the present, of Mr Jarndyce.

Now, you ask my profession.
No profession whatsoever.

I have no aptitude for
worldly affairs, none at all.

There, that's Harold Skimpole
for you.

How do you do, Mr Skimpole?
Very well indeed. . .

thanks to my excellent friends,
of whom John Jarndyce is one of
the very best and kindest. Well. . .

Shall we go in? Miss Clare,
would you do me the honour? Hmm?

THUNDER RUMBLES

THUNDER CRASHES

Will you wait there, please, sir?

I'll go and ask the housekeeper.

Mr Guppy? I've never heard of him.

M'lord and Lady Dedlock
are away in Paris, sir.

They left this afternoon.
The house is all shut up.

Ah, er, my principal, Mr Kenge,
has letters of affidavit
for Lady Dedlock's attention.

You can leave them with me, sir,
I'll see she gets 'em. Ah, right.

Er, begging your pardon most
profoundly for the unsociable
lateness of the hour,

owing to my having got lost
in very unfamiliar country,

I wonder, ma'am, if I might. . .
throw myself upon your mercy.

You want to be allowed to stay
the night? In a word, ma'am.

All right, Mr Guppy. So long as you
don't mind sleeping with the boots.

Show him the way, Rosa.

I covet nothing.

Possessions are nothing to me.
I live as innocently as a child.

Forgive me, sir, did you never. . .
wish you had a house of your own,

and a wife and children
of your own?

Why, bless you, my dear fellow.
I have a wife, and children.

Well, half a dozen I should say,
or more. And love them very dearly.

But how do you look after them?
Look after them?

Well, how could I? You see, I have
no aptitude for work of any kind.

None whatsoever. My friend Skimpole
needs somebody to look after HIM.

Then how do your children live, sir?

Do you know, I've no idea.

But live, they do, somehow or other.

It's no use asking me
how these things are done.

I am a child, a perfect
child, in these matters.

I think your life must be a
very pleasant one, Mr Skimpole.

Well, yes, you might think that.

PIANO MUSIC: Adagio from
"Pathetique" by Beethoven

A lovely young creature like that.

We will not call her an orphan.

She. . . is a child of the universe.

The universe makes rather an
indifferent parent, I'm afraid.

Oh, I don't know. I think I DO know.

Well, this is something,
I should say.

The portrait is of Lady Dedlock
as a young woman.

It's considered a perfect likeness,
and the best work of the master.

Dear me! That's Lady Dedlock, is it?

Blest if I can ever have seen her. . .

yet I know her.

I'm dashed if I don't think. . .

I must have had a dream
of that picture, you know?

KNOCK AT DOOR

If you please, Miss,
Mr Carstone said would you
come to the dining room.

Mr Skimpole's been took, Miss.

Took? Took, Miss. Sudden.

Oh. I understood you were. . .

You are not ill, Mr Skimpole?

Not in the least, Miss Summerson.

We thought you might be
able to advise us, Esther.

This gentleman is Mr Neckett.
NECKETT COUGHS

Mr Skimpole has been
arrested for debt.

Are you arrested for much, sir?

My dear Miss Summerson, I don't know.

Er, some pounds, odd shillings and
a ha'penny were mentioned, I think.

24 pound, 16 and sevenpence
ha'penny, that's what it is.

What will happen if the money is not
produced, sir? Jail. Or Coavinses.

Er, may I ask what is. . .

Coavinses, Miss?
Halfway house for debtors, Miss.

I thought, you see,
that Mr Carstone might,

or his beautiful young cousin, might
sign some sort of a bond or pledge.

Not a bit of it. It's cash
or Coavinses. Make your mind up.

One moment, please, Mr Neckett.

Why are WE drawn into this?

He feels a delicacy about
applying to Mr Jarndyce. . .

Done it too many times before,
no doubt. He has no right.

I know, but what are we going to do?

I think we must pay the man,
if we can.

I have £10 Mr Kenge gave me.
I must try what that will do.

I have £15 and a few shillings.

My life savings.

HE SIGHS
Esther.

And this is the laundry room, Miss.

Thank you, Harriet.

Everything is just as it should be.
Thank you, Miss. Esther?

Would you step in here a moment?

Sit down, my dear.

This, you know, is the Growlery.

When I'm out of humour,
I come here and growl.

Then you must be here very seldom.

HE LAUGHS
You don't know me.

When I'm deceived or disappointed,
when the wind is in the east. . .

Er, now. . .

what is this I hear about Rick and
yourself and Mr Skimpole last night?

Are you angry with us? No! You?
No, bless you, no!

To get hold of the pair of you
and squeeze you

like a couple of young oranges,
that was very bad of him.

But there must be no
more of it, Esther.

If I choose to support him, that's
another thing altogether. 15, was it

Here you are.

And keep it safe. Safe from our
friend Skimpole's inexperience. Hmm?

Thank you.

What is it, Esther?

I don't understand why
you're so good to us.

Well. . .

that's easy.

In your case, I. . .

I hear of a young woman
without a protector,

and I take it into my head
to be that protector.

And Richard and Ada? They've gone
into this dreadful thing through no
fault of their own.

They need help to guide them
through it. Through Chancery?

I wish I could guide
them far away from it.

Jarndyce and Jarndyce has
ruined better men than me.

The years go by, the claims are
passed down generations,

and we can't get out of it,
none of us, on any terms.

My great uncle, Tom Jarndyce, was
brought to despair by it and. . .

blew his own brains out.

I was his heir. This was his home.

When I came here
it was bleak indeed.

And when I brought. . .

what remained of him. . .

home here, I thought the brains
of the house had been. . .

blown out too.

It was so shattered and ruined.

Then you must have made
great changes, sir.

Yes, yes, and in myself, too,
as far as I've been able to.

But I determined never to be
drawn into this case,

with its false hopes
and ruined expectations.

I am fortunate I have enough
to live upon,

and to help others, too, without
tormenting myself with dreams of. . .

HE KNOCKS ON TABLE

Well, I told you this
was the Growlery,

and I think we may have
done with it for one day.

I am very glad to have you
here with me, Esther.

You and. . . Rick and Ada.

Do you think that you
will all be happy here?

Yes, sir, I think so.

And is there anything I could do
to make you more. . .sure of that?

I have been told that I was
my mother's disgrace,

and she is mine.

Do you know what was meant?

I assume what was meant is that
I was born out of wedlock.

But I should like to
know who my mother was. . .

 .and whether she still lives. Ah.

That I cannot tell you, Esther.

Your aunt chose not to tell you
and her secret died with her.

It may be for the best.

Hmm.

Gallant conduct.

Bravery.

You don't see this one very often.

Your own, sir, are they?

How much? To pawn, or sell outright?

Sell outright.

Eight pound.

CLAMB CLEARS HIS THROAT

Those papers, Mr Tulkinghorn,

that you took to Lady Dedlock,
the one you were interested in.

It was copied at Snagsby's.

You quite sure of that? Was there
some complaint about them, sir?

None at all.

Quite the contrary.
That's all, Clamb.

Mrs Pardiggle has threatened to
call. I'm afraid she may insist on
taking you on her rounds.

What rounds would those be, sir?

Charitable rounds, Rick.

Will you be embarking on this
charitable expedition, Mr Skimpole?

I? Oh, no.

Well, I have nothing to give,
but myself.

And Mrs Pardiggle I find a woman
best admired, er, from a distance.

What's the cause we're engaged on,
Mrs Pardiggle?

Visiting a poor family
of brick makers.

The father is a very bad character,

but I believe I have made
great strides with them already.

They love to see me, you know.

Come in, come in.

Well, my friends, I am here again.

There ain't any more
of you, is there?

You won't put me off, good people.

I enjoy hard work, and the harder
you make mine, the better I like it.

Now, did you read the
little book I left with you?

No. I've been drunk for three days.
BABY CRIES

If I had the money,
I'd have been drunk four.

Have I been to church? No, I ain't.

How did my wife get that black eye?

Why, I gives it to 'er.

And if there's anyone else
who wants one, you say the word.

Well, if that's the way,
perhaps we should move on.

There are others more
deserving of our attention.

BABY CONTINUES TO CRY

Is there anything we can do?

Would you like a doctor
for the baby?

I think it's gone too late
for that, Miss.

SHE GASPS

SHE GASPS

SHE SOBS

SHE KEENS

We can do no more for now, Esther.

MOTHER CONTINUES TO CRY

Damn you, boy!

Sorry, sir, I. . . Damn your sorry,
you little blackguard. Leave it!

Or you will deal with me!

Well, Jo, how are you?

Not so bad, thanks, sir.

Here.

Take care of yourself, Jo.

Well, here you are. How did you
like Mrs Pardiggle's charity?

Not at all, sir. Oh, Lord, I
shouldn't have let you go.

You're distressed. Our distress
is nothing. But theirs is. . .

Can nothing be done to help them?
I think something must be done.

But now, Esther, if you feel up to
it, you have a visitor. A visitor?
For me?

A Mr Guppy. Mr Guppy?

Of Kenge and Carboys? Mmm.

Doesn't it concern us all?
Miss Esther Summerson, on a personal
and confidential matter, he said.

Miss Summerson.

Will you take some refreshment?

No, thank you.

I'll take a glass of wine.

HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

Miss Summerson. . .

Er. . .

What is it, Mr Guppy?

My present salary
is two pound a week, and I expect
a further rise of five shillings.

My mother has a little
property, which takes the
form of a small life annuity.

Mr Guppy, I don't understand. . .
Er, Miss Summerson. . .

In the mildest language. . .

I ADORE you.

Now would you be so kind as to
allow me to make a declaration. . .

To make an offer?

Get up, please, Mr Guppy.

I won't hear any more unless you do.

I will, Miss.

As I love and honour,
so likewise I obey.

I'm sorry, Mr Guppy, but I can't
marry you. It's out of the question.

I'm aware that,
in a worldly point of view,

my offer may seem a poor one. . .
No, it isn't that, Mr Guppy. . .

 . but I have been brought
up in a sharp school.

I've ferreted out evidence,
and got up cases.

What means might I not find of
advancing your fortunes,

if I had your confidence, and you
was to set me on? Please stop,
Mr Guppy. . .

I have walked up and down,
of an evening, opposite Jellyby's,

only to look upon the bricks
that once contained thee.

Miss Summerson,

have pity on me.

Mr Guppy, I don't want to disappoint
you, or to cause you pain,

but you must understand
that I don't. . .

 .and couldn't. . .

love you.

I thank you for your
good opinion of me.

And that is your final answer?

Yes.

Er, half a minute, Miss. . .

In case you should think better
at any time,

for MY feelings can never alter. . .

 . Mr William Guppy,
87 Penton Place, will suffice.

My card.

Without prejudice.

My angel.

SHOP DOOR BELL JANGLES

Bless my soul, sir. Mr Tulkinghorn.

I want half a word with you, Snagsby.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

Everything's satisfactory,
I hope, Mr Tulkinghorn?

You copied some affidavits in
that cause for me lately. Yes, sir.

There was one of them,
the handwriting of which is peculiar.

Who copied this? Ah.

We gave this out, sir.
It'll be in the book.

Jarndyce. Here we are, sir.

This was given out to a writer who
lodges just opposite. Name of Nemo.

Nemo? Nemo is Latin for "no-one".

He lodges just opposite?
Above Krook's bottle shop.

Will I take you there? No trouble.
No trouble at all, sir. No,
Snagsby, that will not be necessary.

I was simply curious, that's all.

Good evening, Snagsby. Good evening,
Mr Tulkinghorn. Much obliged to you.

SHOP DOOR BELL JANGLES, CAT HISSES
All right, Lady Jane.

Mr Krook? That's me.

Is your lodger within?

Male or female? Male.

He's in.

Did you want to see him? Yes.

Then you'd best go up.

Second landing. End on the left.

Thank you.

HE KNOCKS ON DOOR

Mr Nemo?

Are you there?

Opium.

Mr Nemo?

Hello, my friend.

The man called Nemo, Mr Tulkinghorn.

He pawned some medals
the day he died.

One of them was inscribed with
the name of Captain Hawdon. Hawdon!

A welsher! A bilker! A defalcator!

Owes me hundreds of
pounds, and gone to ground.

Bad debt. Bad debt. I hate 'em !

You, boy. Come here. Here!

I ain't done nothing, sir.

What do you do here?
Let the boy go, Mr Tulkinghorn.

You're frightening him.

He is the very kindest of physicians
in all the world.

He will have his reward
on the Day of Judgement.

I shall never be a
person of consequence.

No? Well, you'll have to allow
me to disagree with you, then.

I think you like Mr Woodcourt
a great deal, don't you? I did.

Oh, Ada, if only life could
be like this all the time.

Well, it could, couldn't it? Perhaps.

I love him so much, Miss Summerson.

Oh, Lor', that's his dad.

Strike home, sir. Strike home.

Delighted to welcome you to the
mysteries of our profession,
Mr Carstone.

Richard Carstone, MRCS.

I suppose there is. . .

rather a lot of blood. But don't let
me discourage you.

I've been thinking that the law

is the boy for me. The law?

Tell you the truth,
I can't make head nor tail of it.

And, er, what profession have
you settled upon this time?

The Army, sir.

All these costs, costs,
costs and nothing is done.

Nothing is for nothing, as they say.

Might I ask, Miss Summerson,
what YOUR family was?

I never knew my mother or
my father, Mrs Woodcourt.

This is to be hushed up if it can be.

I am not sure that I could
do that, Mr Tulkinghorn.

You must, Lady Dedlock.

For the sake of the family honour,
you must.
