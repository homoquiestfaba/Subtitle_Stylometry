[ Alex ] What are you doing?

Nothing.

[ Alex ] Where did you get that?

It's my mom's.

You never heard of a digital camera?

That aren't real pictures...
they are just... files.

What will you do with that?

Keep it...

to remember this day.

It's a kind of gay.

Why?

[ Alex ]  I don't know...

that to remember...

that's why I must go away
from this place.

It's not that bad.

Yes it is!

I...,
I made you a tape

...for the drive.

Ooh my God!

You are so fucking old school.

I like tapes.

What's on?

Stuff...

OK.

Our song,
you know.

Best friends
don't have songs!

Sure they do.

It's a kind of faggy.

Shut up!

You said it.

Never mind...

What is it?

Nothing.

Tell me?
It's... just a song.

So, I'm like your boyfriend?

It's not what I said.

[ Alex ] It sounded like that you
said I'm your boyfriend.

That's because you don't listen.

Or listen to well.

[ Josh ] It's not like it is
a love song or anything...

it's just a song...

a regular song

we... played it all the time,

every time we get
in the car we played it,

every time we go
to your house we played it,

I never heard it before... till
you played it for me,

so now...
now when I hear it...

I think about... you know...
...you,

and when you leave tomorrow
and I won't see you like for half a year...

and I hear the song...
I will think about you,

and about us...

hanging out together,

that's all.

Yeah...
that still sounds a kind of faggy.

Fine, I keep it!

I'm just kidding, I won't.

[ Josh ] No. You don't!
Please.

No you missed your chance.
Come on.

No it's not even in there!
Please.

Too late!

Fine, screw you!

You wish!

[ rippling water ]

[ click-clack ]

I swear to God that my mom is
going to kill me if I not finished packing.

[ Josh ] What time you gonna leave?

[ Josh ] I do not know!

Early.

[ Josh ] Ah!

What?

You do not come by?

[ Josh ] Maybe...

I let you know...

What if we go away and when...
we come back we... are different?

Of course we will be different!

That's what happens 
when you go away.

What if the next time I see you...
I'm a different person than I'm now?

Or you are a different person?

I don't know.

Wish we had gone together.

83b
Honestly I'm glad how you took it,
I would have done the same thing.

You would?
Probably...

What if I made the wrong decision...

It's just college!

I know..., I just always thought
we would go together.

Things happen.

Maybe we can meet up in the
fall sometime. - Maybe!

Homecoming is in October.
Are you serious?

That's where homecomings are for.

Who leaves and then comes back two
months later for same lame ass homecoming?

That is totally queer!

Not, it is not.
It is! It is totally queer!

Stop. - I'm just saying...
Stop! Stop saying...

you can't keep saying that!

I'm not a stupid kid anymore.
OK.

OK.

You can't just saying stupid shit
all the time!

I don't say it all the time.
Yes you do

you say it all the time, every time you fucking
mouth opens you say it and it bothers me...

Why is everything always faggeting
or gay with you?

It is not!
Yes it is!

I'm sorry.
No you are not.

I said I'm sorry.
It really bothers me!

It really... really bothers me!

Do you understand that?
Yes!

No. I do not think you do.
I know!

Do... you... understand?

Yes!

I'm sorry.

[ rolling waves ]

But ... if I do

Yeah.

You won't be different...
