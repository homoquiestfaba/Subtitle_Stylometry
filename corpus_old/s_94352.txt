Good morning, it´s 7:00 a.m.

Got the Godfather of Soul comin´ at you
and he wants to know, how do you feel?

Anybody home?

-You the foreman?
-Yeah, Im the foreman. I dont want any.

-Im your new carpenter.
-What?

I read the ad in the newspaper
for carpenters. Here I am.

No, no. We filled that job.
Got a full house, buddy. Sorry.

Youre making a big mistake here.
Im a precision machine, man!

I can do twice the work
of any of these guys. I swear.

Great. Ill alert the media.

-The media?
-The media.

-East Coast?
-Yeah.

New York, upstate? Syracuse?

Where?

-Im from Binghamton.
-Binghamton! I was close!

I dont believe this!

What?

Look.

Give me this. This first day,
I work for free.

I give it to you, its a gift.
Second day, you pay me for two days.

Third day, I have your job.

-One day! One day!
-All right. One day.

-Start upstairs. On the roof.
-Thanks. Youre a good man.

Binghamton! Man, Im embarrassed!

Where do I go, man? Give me a job!

-Work with him.
-Okay.

Hey, guys!

Whats your name, man?

Howard. Whats yours?

What the fuck are you doing?

Seven kids.

-Right.
-Right. You got it. Boys, girls?

-Five girls, two boys.
-Thats great, man. Thats great.

-Congratulations.
-All right.

A lot of mouths to feed there.

You got that right.

Take them all out to dinner. Do that.

-Whats this?
-I just found it on the street. Its $100.

-Just take them out to dinner.
-Im not taking your money.

No, really. Ill tell you what happened.
Its the truth.

Im walking down the street,
I look down and there it is.

I bend down to pick it up...

...a voice out of nowhere says,
´Give it to Howard.´

I didnt know a Howard until today!
It must be you! Your lucky day.

-Im not taking your money.
-Take the money! Its not a big deal.

Take it! For the kids.

Take them to dinner.
A couple of Big Macs.

´I feel good

´Like I knew that I would now

´I feel good´

You like chop suey?

Ill make it up to you. Trust me.

Hello? Hi.

How are you?

Fine. Yeah.

Tonight?

Tonights fine. No!
No, nothing that I cant cancel.

Okay. So, I guess Ill see you tonight, then.
Okay. Bye.

Come on up, man.

Look at this shit.

Man! Do you ever feel like flying, Howard?
Just taking off?

-Just fly away!
-Why the hell not?

Fly.

´Why the hell not?´
Exactly, why the hell not?

No goddamn reason why not, Howard.

What are you doing, man?

Now, if you look at the situation here...

...what we got here is a roof...

...75% pitch, which is very nice.

I wouldnt go no further, man.

What were looking for here is a balance.

All we gotta do is find a little...

...equilibrium.

We got the westerlies coming in.
Fourteen, fifteen miles an hour.

Come on. Step back here, man.

Howard, let me tell you something, man.
This is basic physics, okay?

All you gotta do is find
a little equilibrium here.

Some equilibrium and a little balance.

Give me a rope, somebody.
Give me a rope!

Its equilibrium. Balance, Howard.
Lots of balance. Balance.

-Balance.
-Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

Balance....

The force of the thrust against the drag.

And then you get lift-off!

-Feels good?
-It feels great!

-Come on, baby!
-Im coming!

Its all right! Ill take care of you.

-Were gonna fly!
-I know. We gonna fly!

Yes, indeed. We gonna fly.

Got the drag on there.

-Got the drag on, man.
-I feel it.

Now dont turn away from me!
Come here!

-Talk to me.
-Here we come!

Dont move away from me!

-Stay with me.
-Here we come!

Dont go no further! Dont go no further!

You dont have to do this.
You dont have to do this, man. Okay?

Come on, come on.

Stay right there. Let me talk to you.
Just stay right there.

Im a plane! Im gonna swoop down!
Im gonna fly!

-Howard?
-Look at me, man. Look at me.

This is what were gonna do.

Were gonna fly down,
come around the front of the ambulance...

...come around the back.
Im gonna land right on that bed!

In fact, Ill go around it three times
and then let down!

So just move the bed around a little bit!
Ill slide right in!

-Youre late.
-Youre later. Shell be mad.

Im terrified.

The Psychiatric Emergency Room is closed
almost daily because of the staff cuts.

The situation here...

...is also dire.

Our unofficial policy is evaluate...

...medicate, vacate.

Sound cold-blooded?

It is.

They need the treatment
and we need the beds.

At this point, Id like to turn you over
to two of my staff...

...Dr. Elizabeth Bowen and Dr. Patrick Shea.

Theyll show you around the facilities.

I trust youll enjoy your visit. Thank you.

-Good morning.
-Good afternoon.

In the years 1970 to 1975,
four US mental hospitals....

I must speak with....

Okay. Welcome.
That was our good friend, Mr. Wilson.

Dr. Bowen and I will be going on rounds,
so follow us, please.

Come in. Move around there,
let everyone in. Dont be shy.

He wont bite, we hope.

What have we got here?

We have a male Caucasian.

Hes approximately 35.
Was brought in by the police.

He was doing a high-wire act on a roof.

When he came in, he was highly agitated,
delusional, having auditory hallucinations.

Has anyone examined him yet?

The resident made a preliminary diagnosis
of paranoid schizophrenia.

What did they give him?

Haldol, 10 milligrams. Thats pretty heavy.
It seems to have worked.

This is a new patient.
Whats the first thing we do?

-Assess the patients orientation.
-Very good, very good. Elizabeth?

Can you tell me your name?

No name, no history.
No one on the job knew him.

Do you know what day this is?

What?

Jones.

Whatd he say?

I think he said, ´Jones.´
His name is Jones.

Jones....

-Hi.
-Hi.

Im so glad to see you.

What did you do to your hair?

-You look great! You look wonderful!
-Thanks. Is this a bad time?

No, no. The paintings in the bedroom.
And, you have....

You have some mail.

-Libbie....
-Hi.

This is June.

Its so nice to meet you.

You know, its been six months, Libbie.

I just thought it was time
you should meet her.

Take your crap out of the medicine cabinet,
while youre at it.

All right, okay.

Youre a robot, you know that?

I cant hear you.

Youre not a real person.

Only a mutant would pull a stunt like this.

Are you talking to yourself, Libbie?

Yeah, Im talking to myself.

Who would have thought
that Id be on the Johnny Carson Show?

Did you know, when I was born...

...I didnt have a name
till I was 3 years old?

Why?

Because my father,
whos this really rigid old Chinese guy...

...told me that when I was little,
there was an ancient Chinese tradition...

...where the unborn child knows its name
before its even born.

So the parents listen for it
and they try to get the name.

Obviously, in my case,
they couldnt hear it.

Its not like they werent listening,
it was on purpose.

My mother wanted to name me Miranda
because she liked to dress like that.

With fruit and stuff.... I mean, hats!
I dont understand these hats.

But she couldnt say, ´Miranda´ because
it was ´Melanda´ and didnt sound right.

She wanted to avoid
the whole ´L´ and ´R´ thing.

So they called me Amanda. Amanda!

Shes never understood me.

She always has this...

...big smile on her face!

As if nothings wrong,
as if everything is okay.

Always.

My work is very important.
The Pentagon is aware of this.

I have received communication
from CBS News, 6"30 p.m., every night.

´Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Where are you?
Where are you?´

I cannot return the communication
if my mind is clouded...

...and if poison is being placed in my food!

´Im late, Im late
For a very important date´

Hi, Im a doctor! Im also a ´lateaholic.´
Im late! I work late!

I get up late. I sleep late. I eat late.
Its too damn late to do anything about it.

-Mr. Jones?
-Where? Where? Get the net!

-Are you leaving us?
-Yes! Yes! I am leaving!

How are you feeling?

Did you do that to your husband
every morning? ´How are you feeling?´

I bet that just popped him right up
out of bed, didnt it?

Youre wondering how I knew
you were married?

Elementary, my dear Miss Watson.
May I have your hand?

A slight discoloration on the ring finger.

And this rather fragile air about you
as if youve been recently damaged.

-Beautiful accent though. Swedish, isnt it?
-Yes.

I find your country to be very lovely.
Cold, but....

-Bye, Elizabeth.
-Howd you know my name?

Have you tried the drugs here?
You should, you know.

You shouldnt be allowed to prescribe
unless you know.

You see, because we hear
everything in the room.

-Be careful what you say.
-Sorry we didnt get to talk.

Yeah, Im sorry too. Im sorry. Sorry.
We could talk. We could talk.

Do you like choral music?
Beethoven" Ninth Symphony, Ode to Joy?

You could use a little joy. I know I could.
I got tickets tonight.

Well go. Well fill our empty hearts.
Well find an all-night café.

Well be there all night long talking
as long as you want. What do you say?

Try, ´yes.´ Give me your number.
Ill call you.

I didnt mean that.

-What did you mean?
-I mean, we could talk.

We are talking. But you need to talk.
I want you to talk.

We should talk here.

You were very distressed yesterday.
I think you need treatment.

-Yes, late! Late! Gotta go!
-Heres my card.

-Will you please call me?
-Absolutely! ´Dr. Elizabeth Bowen!´

-Good-bye! Late! Gotta go!
-Will you call?

Yeah, probably not.

This was a standard-procedure release.
Whats the problem here?

-I think he was misdiagnosed.
-How so?

He was psychotic but not schizophrenic.
He was expansive...

...intrusive, inappropriate, euphoric.
I think hes a manic.

Okay, fine. Fine. Hes manic.
You know, the guy refused medication.

It wouldve meant a hearing.
We wouldve lost.

Give him a few more hours
and hell think he can fly again.

´I feel good

´Like I knew that I would now

´I feel good

´Like I knew that I would now

´I feel good

´So good

´I got you´

-She didnt have an account number--
-She said you were rude.

I just asked for verification.

Were the second largest
savings institution in this state.

We didnt get that way by being snotty.

You have a customer.

Hi, can I help you, sir?

Yes, I would like a double cheeseburger,
fries and a chocolate shake.

Just kidding.

-Id like to close my account, please.
-You just opened this account last week.

Yeah, Im a fickle kind of guy.

Oh, my goodness.

Okay, you have $12,752 in your account.
Do you want that in hundreds?

Ill leave that up
to your impeccable judgement.

I just want to make sure that
I have a nice big fat wad of fives...

...for all the valet parking I plan to do.

-Dont forget the interest.
-Certainly.

-On five days?
-Yeah.

-Thats 5.5 percent....
-That would be....

Compounded daily, that is $9.60.

-How did you do that?
-Its easy. Its so easy. So easy.

-Keep one of those hundreds for yourself.
-I cant do that!

-No, youre gonna need it.
-I am? Why?

Youre taking me to lunch.

We need his-and-hers chilidogs!
His-and-hers, with all the fixings.

One for the lady, coming up. One more.

Here you go.

-Are you nuts? I cant break a $100 bill.
-Keep the change.

Music heaven.

This is a body. These are bodies.
Theyre womens bodies.

All over here. Look at this.

30-percent off before the sale,
another 25-percent off....

You can take this piano home
for less than half--

I hear Bach.

Excuse me.

Im hearing it also.

-No. Can you play it faster? Really fast?
-Absolutely!

Sold?

A piano....

More. We need more.
More piano. More piano.

-Whats your name, man?
-Pedro.

Pedro, have fun.

-Thank you.
-Get out of here.

Thank you, sir. If theres anything else
you need, just let me know.

I mean, you know, men will say that
youre good, but I know Im good.

Totally uninhibited.

Very smooth.

I make a lot of noise.

They like that.

I pretend that Im out of control.

I always pretend that Im out of control,
but Im never out of control.

You know what I mean?
Im never out of control.

It isnt that far! Come on.

-Maybe we should go to the hotel.
-Stay here.

-Buddy, can you spare some change?
-Sure. Here.

-Here you go, here you go.
-Hey, thanks, man.

You like that music, huh?

All men are brothers...

-What are you, a musician?
-...beneath your soft wings.

No. No, but I was a music student.

I had this wonderful,
beautiful girlfriend named Ellen.

And she was a composer.
She was really an extraordinary person.

-I think of her all the time.
-What happened?

-She died. Its okay.
-Im very sorry.

-Point it out.
-The second row.

Careful with the boots!

They got weights on them!
Look at the boots!

Hey, flying boots! Fly! Fly! Fly!

Im relaxed! Its too tight!

Its too tight. Im not struggling, all right?

Its too tight. Its too tight. I cant....

You two, come here. Come here a second.
I want to talk to you!

I have a doctor here! I have a doctor!

Dr. Elizabeth Bowen! I have a doctor!

Give me that. Give me that.

Come back, come back.
Zero, zero. Zero, zero, three, three.

Surprise, surprise. I know, I know.
Dont even say it.

Its like trying to stop a space shuttle
with a rubber band.

What did you give him?

-Well, we waited for you.
-Why?

Well, youre his doctor.

Mr. Jones.

Mr. Jones?

Elizabeth.

-You gotta get me out of here.
-I cant do that.

Not right now.

Right. I know the rules.
Seventy-two hours. I know.

But you can do it. You can do it. Please?
Please? Please, Im dying!

-Get me the fuck out of here.
-Mr. Jones, you have a disease.

Manic-depressive disorder.

Its like having diabetes.

No shit! And here I thought
I was just having a bad day!

Its a highly treatable chemical imbalance.

-Weve had a great deal of success--
-Look, fuck-face!

I have been in and out of hospitals
for 20 years!

There are two words that I really
do not appreciate!

One is ´great,´ the other ´success.´

Im going to tell you something.

Both of you listen,
you might learn something.

It is not a disease! Okay?
Not a disease! I do not have a disease.

This is who I am! I like who I am!
You got it?

Forget it. Dont even think
about that fucking needle!

Ill give you some medication
so you wont hurt yourself.

Im not hurting myself,
theyre hurting myself.

-Look, Mr. Jones....
-What?

-Youre here?
-Yeah.

-You asked for me?
-Yes.

I came.

You did come. Thank you.
Youve made me very happy. Thank you.

-Now, youre very agitated.
-I am agitated.

-And very tired.
-Im not tired! Im not tired.

Id like to give you something
to help you rest.

Forget the Haldol! Im not taking Haldol.
Forget it!

Thats not Haldol.

-What is it?
-This is Amytal.

-Youve heard of it?
-Yeah.

-Its a sedative.
-Its good.

-Youll sleep.
-I know what it is.

-Something to help you rest.
-To help me rest.

Okay?

Okay. Youre awfully pretty
when you smile.

Here. Let me help you out.

This is going to be good.

Glass of Chardonnay?

Think of this as a whole bottle.

Thank you. Thank you very much.
I enjoyed that.

Now youll go home...

...and have some wine.

Ill have a glass of wine.

Youll think of me and have some wine.

Ill think of you getting better.

Okay. Ill rest, but I wont sleep.

-You dont have to sleep.
-Thank you very much.

Youre pretty. Elizabeth, my Elizabeth.

Okay.

Elizabeth, where do they all go?

Where did he go? He was 18.

Where did he go?

Where...? Mommy?

I had such a bad dream.

Do you understand why you´re here?

Yes. This is a competency hearing.

Do you understand the consequences
of these proceedings?

Yes, I do. I am facing involuntary
commitment to a mental hospital...

...with indeterminate release.

Attorney, you may proceed.

-Please state your name.
-Dr. Elizabeth Bowen.

And Dr. Bowen, are you board-certified
to practice in this state?

Yes, I am.

Why do you think Mr. Jones should be
on a hold?

I believe that he is suffering from
bipolar manic-depressive disorder...

...and hes currently in a manic cycle.

What behaviours or attitudes can
you report to support this assumption?

Two incidents.

In the first, he had to be restrained
on a roof for his own safety...

...after claiming he was going to fly.

Its actually, it was a fairly creative act,
if you keep your mind open.

Okay, all right. Sorry.

In the second, he was brought to us
by the police...

...after disrupting a symphony orchestra.

Excuse me, is the original conductor
here also?

Mr. Jones, please.
Youll have an opportunity to respond.

Thank you. Thank you very much,
Your Honour.

Continue, Dr. Bowen.

I think that his judgement is impaired
and that he is a danger to himself.

In what way?

The manic state is usually followed
by depression.

What are the symptoms of depression?

Hopelessness. Despair.

The inability to experience pleasure,
the inability to function.

Mr. Jones?

´Despair.´ ´Hopelessness.´

´The inability to experience pleasure.´

Now, Doctor...

...are these words and phrases that come...

...spontaneously to you
when you look at me?

Are they? I dont think so.

I deeply respect Dr. Bowen.
She is a wonderful doctor.

I respect her and her advice,
but I graciously say no.

No, thank you.

The fact is, that the doctor and the other
fine healers have decided that Im bipolar...

...and this is without regard to the fact
that they have not one shred of evidence.

Theyve never observed me
once have a depressive symptom.

-Is that not true?
-Yes.

Thank you very much. Now, the fact is,
maybe I never get the blues.

Maybe Im just a happy-go-lucky guy
all the time.

Your Honour, the truth is,
this is a very simple case.

If we go to the issues and see the case
on its merits, its very simple.

Now the fact is
Im a productive human being.

Last year in this country alone...

...over 75,000 people suffering
from depression killed themselves.

Your Honour? Your Honour,
will you please look at me?

Do I look suicidal?

What do you have to say
about these incidents...

...that Dr. Bowen mentioned?

Like the flying scam? I talked about it.

This is not a big deal!
This is nothing! Its kids stuff!

Im a big personality! Im grandiose!

Im a kid, all right? I always will be.
Im sorry.

Your Honour, I swear....

I swear on my life...

...I could have done a better job conducting
that Beethoven piece. I mean it!

Please? Please, Your Honour?

Please, Your Honour,
please do not lock me up.

You dont have to do this.
I promise Ill be a good boy.

There are people who really are sick
and need that bed more than I do.

Sit down, Mr. Jones.

Okay. I just want to thank you again.
Thank you, Your Honour.

Want to go bowling?

Do you want to do me a favour?

Next time youre in trouble,
dont ask for me. Im a busy person.

I didnt expect youd be a bad loser.

Were not competing.

What is going on here?

I was fighting for freedom in there.
I dont know what youre in this for.

Tell me something. Do you crash?

What?

Do you get suicidal?

Do you?

How can I get suicidal?
I have my little friends here. Lithium.

Four a day, every day...

...keeps those highs and lows away.

If you take them.

Elizabeth. Elizabeth, wait a second.

Id be happy to make an appointment
with you if you want.

Im worried about you.
Something happened.

-Good-bye.
-Is it your ex?

Take your medicine, pay your taxes....

Is his girlfriend pregnant?

Shes not pregnant.
You know nothing about me.

Is it the yuppie doctor?
Is he hitting on you?

I dont know how I shall put this. Shut up!

Im sorry. I didnt mean it.

What are you doing?

I dont live very far from here.
I thought maybe you could give me a ride.

Im a psychiatrist. If you have
a psychiatric problem, call me.

If you have a transportation problem,
you call a cab, okay?

I guess maybe I do have a problem.

I dont have any money.

So, tell me. When did you
first notice the symptoms?

-Elizabeth, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

Good.

Say you go to the theatre tonight, right?

You go to the theatre.
You run into your gynaecologist.

He says to you"

´Good evening, Elizabeth,
are you enjoying the play?

´How about that little condition
you came to me about last week?

-´Lets have a look.´
-Its not the same.

Its exactly the same thing!

Youre at the theatre, with your dress up....

Me, on a beautiful day like this,
with a woman like you....

Its exactly the same thing.

The minute the doctor shows up,
and starts poking around in things...

...that he or she is uninvited
to be poking around in, its rude.

I guess I never thought of it that way.

-Im sorry.
-Yeah.

-Yeah. Ill forgive you.
-Thanks.

-If you feed me.
-I cant.

Cant? This is America.
You can do anything you want!

-I have appointments!
-I have hunger.

Mucho hunger.

I really cant.

Who needs you more today than me?

There cant be anyone. Im desperate.

You want to do this, I know you do.

There! There it is!

You see it? The road to forgiveness.

Ill talk about me. I will.

Just turn. Come on.

Yes! I knew it! I knew shed do it! Yes!

So, what were you doing
on the stage that night?

Picking up the tempo.

Why would you do that?

Look, Ode to Joy was meant
to be played allegro vivace"

Quickly, with life.

Beethoven might have been stone deaf,
but he had an impeccable sense of time.

If he wasnt dead, hed have dragged
that bastard offstage.

Truth be known, I was just there
protecting my friend Ludwig.

-You know a lot about music, dont you?
-Yeah, yeah.

Do you play?

There. Go ahead.

Have you ever played?

-Shall we dance?
-No way.

Come on, Elizabeth! A couple of steps up,
everythings different.

I dont want different.

Want to know who I am?
You gotta go where I am.

If you dont get down right now, Im going.

Its all right. Fear is allowed here.

Its just that I even get dizzy in high heels.

I know its silly.
I know its just a childhood thing.

Theres nothing I can do about it.

Do you ever have flying dreams?

I dont know. Maybe when I was a kid.

You know, interesting.

Ive asked that question all over the world
and everyone says the same thing.

Why is it only children have flying dreams?

Shes late. Shes late.

Not yet.

How did you get started?

A little psychiatric kit
for Christmas one year?

No.

Whyd you give up dancing?

Howd you know that?

The feet! You got crunched toes
heading east and west...

...and you walk like a duck
when youre not paying any attention.

-I dont.
-You do! Its cute. I like it.

You still dance?

-What do you mean, ´east and west´?
-Look at them!

If your legs followed your feet,
youd split in half.

Were you a little ballerina
with ribbons in your hair?

-They do not.
-They do!

What happened to her?
This ´Little Miss Twinkletoes´?

I had a wild couple of months
where every morning Id wake up...

...and something was different.

Like somebody was stretching
my body parts when I was asleep.

I felt like I had arms down to my knees
and a neck about 18-inches long.

I didnt even want to leave my room.

I thought I looked like Lurch,
from the Addams Family.

Yes, I know.

-Its hell, isnt it?
-What?

Growing up.

Yeah. It stinks.

My new boots! Damn!

Yeah. Home sweet home.

Youre an interesting man, Mr. Jones.

-Would you want to make me ordinary?
-No.

I want you to be well.

´Well´? Im well, believe me.
I am ecstatic.

You want to cure me of that?

Thats just your chemistry talking.

Chemistry again?

Its all chemical.
The whole universe is chemical.

Youre chemicals. Im chemicals.

Love, sadness, pain, grief.

If I touch you, touch you here...

...you feel something, right?

If I touch you back here....

Lean forward a little bit.

Lean forward. Drop your head.
Drop your head a little more.

Right there.

You hold your tension right there,
dont you?

Just an observation.

-Wonderful afternoon, wasnt it?
-Yes.

Thanks for the ride.

-Bye.
-Bye.

Mr. Jones!

Your chemicals.

-All right. Then 3"00.
-Thats good.

-What do you want?
-I just want my tools, thats all.

Dont worry about your tools.
Worry about staying out of trouble.

I wanted to thank you
about giving me the chance.

-No problem.
-Im sorry, I was a little strange.

-Why dont you get lost?
-Maybe you could give me another chance.

Hey, pal, Im telling you,
why dont you get lost, all right?

You gotta be fucking joking,
you fucking lunatic.

Ill come back tomorrow. Thats better.
Thats a lot better. Okay?

Ill come back.... What about my tools?

Hey, man.

How you feeling?

Im okay. I appreciate what you did for me.

Thats all right. Listen, I got your tools
at the house. You want to come get them?

Okay, everybody. All right, Peytan,
you lead everybody in grace.

Thank you for the food
that were blessed to have.

Thank you for our health, our home...

...and our family. Amen.

Mr. Jones, may I have your plate, please?

Pass that glass down.

Pass that glass down.

Hi, kid.

Whats up?

Do you know how to do this?

What do you got there, math?

All right, now the thing you gotta
remember about long division...

...is that its short division,
just smaller numbers.

I can do this.

Hello, yeah. I understand youre the doctor
whos treating Mr. Jones?

What can I do for you?

You know, Doctor!

What?

I dont know, he seems
like hes really having some problems.

Mr. Jones.

I cant stop the sadness!

Its all right. Its all right.

We can do this as a round, if youd like.

´Taking showers....´

My dad and I had a fight.

My mother was crying.

And I stayed up all night waiting.

I broke their hearts.

Are you taping this?

Yeah.

Do you mind?

Doesnt matter.

Mr. Jones, the way I see it,
were dealing with two problems here.

One is chemical, and were treating that.

And the other one is...

...I think...

...your pain.

Itll take hard work
for us to get at those feelings.

Do you understand?

Will you work with me?

Do we have a deal?

Now, what we want to do is
let our movement express how we feel.

Okay? Let yourself move
through the space...

...and express your inner life.

Okay, just be gentle, all right?

Thats right. Yeah. Just let it out.

Just let it come up somehow. Its in here?
Its in there? Just let it out.

Mr. Jones? What are you being?

An erection.

I have no memory.

You cant remember anything?

Sometimes.

What happens when
you can´t remember anything?

I can´t stop. It makes me....

Good.

Very good.

Mr. Jones, how about you?
Dont you want to paint something?

This is your opportunity
to really express yourself.

Tell me about the first time
you got into trouble.

Okay.

Now I will tell you the first time...

...I got into trouble.

I was working in a construction crew,
building tract houses.

And I was a pretty tough guy
and I was getting into things...

...with guys, and no one was gonna
mess with me ´cause I was very tough.

I was a tough guy.
I am a very, very tough guy.

At the same time, I was also like going out
with a really groovy girl named Ellen.

And, Ellen went and died, you know.

And then I did things that werent good.

And I broke things and hit people and stuff.

Then they took me to jail, right?
So they took me to jail...

...and I´m sitting in jail,
then I´m climbing the bars...

...and I´m like doing stuff
and I´m climbing up there...

...and I´m screaming out
that I´m King Kong.

And all this stuff. You know, so then
they take me away to a mental hospital.

-Where?
-Houston.

-Why are you lying?
-Im not lying.

Im not lying!

Yeah. You were King Kong
in a jail in Houston.

Houston.

Houston.

Yeah.

Okay. You want to come back tomorrow?

Okay.

I was in college.

What happened?

I swallowed some aspirin.

How many?

Seventy-three heavy-duty,
full-strength Tylenol.

I was young.

It was on a full stomach...

...and my roommates found me.

Theres something I want you to know.

Ever since that night...

...I have never...

...ever...

...had a headache.

True story.

I believe you.

How you doing, man?

Howard?

Howard!

-What are you doing here?
-Ive come to see you, boy.

Did they get you, too?

-You look good, man.
-Yeah.

-For real.
-Im getting there. Im getting there.

-How long have I been in here?
-A month.

Month. Time flies.

Excuse me, sir. Im sorry to interrupt,
but could I ask a question?

Sure.

-Did you drive here?
-I did.

-What kind of car do you have?
-Pickup.

You know youre injecting poisons
into our food and our bodies?

Okay, Mr. Wilson. Thank you.

-Thought that guy was your doctor.
-Its hard to tell sometimes.

Like with these three over there.

Now, Howard, you tell me.
Which one there is the patient?

The lady. The sad-looking lady.

That is my doctor.

What about these over here?
The little girl?

Tried to kill herself three times.

And the big lady over here, big fat lady?

All right. Okay. All right. All right, man.

-I came to see you. Okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

Come on, man. Come on.

When can you get out of here?

I dont know.

I dont know.

And this woman is so awful to me.

You got my number. Call me anytime.

What is this? What is this? What?

You will not believe this, man.

You wont believe what happened to me.

Im walking down the street,
day before yesterday.

The sky opens up....

Listen, I hear this voice saying"

´´Give this to Mr. Jones. ´´

Mr. Altman?

Mr. Altman, I dont think youre supposed
to be off the unit.

-Mr. Altman?
-My wife....

Whats the matter with your wife,
Mr. Altman?

She didnt come.

You expected her to come today
and she didnt come?

Is that it?

-She did not come to visit.
-I understand.

Okay. Why dont we go back to your room
and then you can call her.

Mr. Altman?

Mr. Altman?

Do you think shes fucking around?

I do. I think shes fucking around on me.

Just lets walk back, you and I,
to your ward and call her.

Is that okay?

Come on.

Hey, Arnie! Arnie!
I gotta talk to you, man.

I gotta talk to you about something!

Hey, you look good, man! You look good!

-My wife is fucking around!
-That aint your wife! Thats a doctor.

Your wifes not here!

-She didnt come to see me!
-Shell come. Heres protection.

You feel good! You feel real good!
Feel good!

-You feel real good!
-I feel good.

Have you seen my wife?

We need a medic over here.

Wait a minute! Shit!

No! Its the wrong guy!

Wait a minute!

No! I feel good! I feel good!

Wait. Wait. You okay? You all right?

Dr. Bowen, are you all right?

What happened? Did he hit you? Where?

Here.

I just wanted to say thank you.
I thought about buying you something...

...but what do you buy a person
who saves your life?

Its no big deal.

Yes. Very big deal. Biggest deal there is.

Now you got a war story.

Something you can tell around
the campfire to the kiddies.

Scare them to death.

You cant let that big guy corner you
like that again.

Youre ´Old Doc Twinkletoes,´ remember?

-Ill remember.
-Okay. You do that.

-Mr. Jones?
-Yeah?

Want to play?

With you?

Love-one.

My serve.

Love-two.

All right! We know its two-love.
Thank you very much.

-I had to do it.
-Its my point.

Love-three.

-Whose point?
-Her point.

-Who the fuck made you scorekeeper?
-Official tournament rules.

My point.

-Dont cheat.
-Im not cheating, youre cheating.

My point.

-You cant do that!
-It didnt hit the table.

-Yes!
-I got it!

-It was off the table. Whats the score?
-Wilson, it hit!

-One-three.
-No! It is not her point!

-Touched the table.
-It wasnt her point! It did not hit!

Bad manners, you lose a point!

We got ten people watching this.
I got the point.

-Well play the point over.
-It was my point.

It was my point, but well play it over.

-Come on, lets go.
-Wait a minute.

Why is it I keep winning
and she gets the points?

My point.

It touched the table. Tournament rules!

What do you mean? That was my point!

Shut the fuck up!

You shut the fuck up!
Im going to win this game!

-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

Fuck you, too! You son of a bitch!

Fucking nutsos.

-Ready?
-Okay, all right.

My point again.

Okay, all right, give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

Wait a minute here. Give me the ball.

-I havent got it!
-I saw you!

I didnt--

-Give me the ball. Were playing a game!
-Bad manners, you lose a point!

´´Escalator to manager´s office. ´´

So I have to go to him!

Mr. Jones, medication for you.

Mr. Jones, its time for your medication.

Im watching the cartoon.

Let me get to the bottom of this!

-Its time for your medication.
-I said, not today.

-Mr. Jones, its time for--
-I said, dont!

Im sorry.

Im sorry.

I cant do this anymore.

I appreciate you trying so hard.

I gotta get out of here.

Is it the medication?

Elizabeth, I am a junkie.

I really need my highs.

I really miss my highs very badly.

And the lows?

Yeah, well...

...guess Ill take my chances.

Listen to me.

When you first came to this hospital
you were suicidal, right?

I didnt come to this hospital.

I came to you.

I guess maybe I owe you my life.

Well, then, were even.

Thank you again...

...for helping me the other day.

It was so wonderful to see the way
you dealt with Mr. Altman.

You have such a gift with people.

You do, I envy you.

You have so much to offer.
Please, dont give up.

When I was 3 years old...

...I played Mozart.

By the time I was 12,
I had read everything.

When I was 18...

...I was the centre of the universe.

And then I woke up one day,
and I was in a mental institution.

Im not normal.

Ive never been normal.

I cant live down here anymore.
I cant do it. I cant.

I cant do it by myself.

No. Not by yourself.

It hurts.

Were grateful for all youve done.

But we feel that we can handle it
from this point on.

We do have a large and supportive family.

Dr. Bowen, what do you think?

I think youre ready to go back to school.

Youre so much stronger now.

You feel stronger, dont you?

Yeah.

But I do think we need
to continue your treatment.

So well just go back
to our Tuesday morning sessions.

Okay, Amanda?

Actually, my parents have this friend
thats a therapist...

...and they would like me to try
a few sessions with him.

-Bye.
-Bye.

-Thank you.
-Good-bye.

Bye.

So, you call me if you need me? Promise?

Okay? Okay.

Lets be optimistic.

-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-I have a meeting.

I can be late.

-No. No, thats all right.
-Tomorrow?

Yeah, I needed to talk to you.

-You find me!
-Okay!

Libbie. Libbie, come here a minute.

All right, I want you to meet Dr. Bowen.

All right? This is Susan.

Hello.

She was with Mr. Jones
at the Beethoven concert.

-Shed like to have a word with you.
-Okay.

He was just so special.
He was unexpected and exciting...

...and just crazy enough
to make the afternoon interesting.

In what way, crazy?

Well, crazy.

Like, for instance,
we were in this hotel and...

...this room-service guy comes
with some champagne and...

...he calls this guy right into the bathroom.

We were both in the bathtub.

And he just stood up, you know?
He was, like, completely naked.

I guess you had to be there.

Even if he were here,
it would be confidential.

And were not allowed to give out
any information about patients.

Im really sorry.

Can I just give you my phone number,
in case?

Yeah, of course.

You know, I dont think hes married
or anything.

He did talk about another woman
in his life though.

Ellen. Ellen something?

She was a music student.

Do you remember her last name?

Ellen something.

He said she died.

I figured that gave me
a little edge over her.

So, who is it that were looking for?

-A music student.
-Yes?

-Female.
-Yes?

-Here in the mid 70s.
-Yes?

-First name, Ellen.
-Yes?

-Thats it?
-Thats it.

This could take a while.

What do you want me to talk about today?

Anything you like.

Anything? Lets talk about you.

Okay, you choose.

Ellen.

-Ellen? Which Ellen?
-Your Ellen.

My Ellen? Yeah, my Ellen. Sure.

Ellen.

Ellen was probably the only person...

...who ever really loved me.

The most beautiful red hair.

She thought I could be...

...Mozart, Shakespeare, Einstein,
Picasso, Nijinsky.

And then she was gone.

How did she die?

She fell off a trapeze.

No, she was run over by a cement mixer.

What difference does it make?
Shes gone. Shes dead.

None.

What was her last name?

I dont remember.

Was it Ryan?

Ellen Ryan?

You are one very, very sick motherfucker.

What have you been doing,
spying on me? Miss FBI?

I spoke to her.

Ellen Ryan is now Mrs. Ellen Naughton.

She lives in Iowa. She has two children.

She was so happy to hear
that you were being helped...

...because the whole time
you were together...

...you would never admit
that there was anything wrong.

Thats why she had to leave you.

No. She died.

-No.
-She died.

She didnt die.

-Are your parents still alive?
-My parents never were alive.

Fuck you, you sick motherfucker.

Who the fuck do you think you are?

You think youre a fucking doctor?
Youre full of shit! Youre sick!

Im not sick! You dont treat me
like a fucking sick person!

I dont skulk around! I dont fucking spy!

Youre not a sick person,
youre a person with a sickness.

Dont fucking talk to me about sick!
Youre sick!

The disease is not who you are.
Its separate from you, and can be treated.

I am what I am! This is what I am!
And fuck you!

Youre not a friend of mine!
You have no right to talk to me!

I dont need this. What am I doing?
I dont fucking need this.

I dont need it at all.
I dont have to be here. And Im going.

Bye, see you around, pal.

Damn!

Why? Why? Why? Dumb!

What do you expect?
You go there to see some stupid....

Dont you ever do it again!
Why am I doing it again?

What do you expect?
You go to a hospital looking for....

All right. Stupid!
Stupid, why do you do this? Stupid!

-Dont do it again.
-Get in the car!

-Please! Lets talk.
-Get out of here!

Please, just get in the car!

Cant we just talk?

-I dont want to talk.
-Please!

Get away from me!
Youre sicker than I thought you were!

Get out of here!

Can you please just stop and listen to me?

All right, what? What do you want?
What?

You dont even know, do you?

All right, all right, I forgive you.
Now, just get the hell away from me.

Look, I was wrong, okay? Ive never
violated a patients privacy before.

And you still havent.
Cause Im not your patient!

I never was! You get it?

I checked myself in! I checked myself out!

My mistake was looking for a friend
in a hospital! Im not gonna do it again!

Ellen said she thinks
about you all the time.

She never passes a music store...

...or a concert hall without looking
for your work.

Shut up!

-Whyd you say she was dead?
-Im warning you!

Whyd you say it? Tell me!

Because she is dead, thats why!
And so are you!

What about my work? My work?

Why didnt she come looking for me?

She couldnt do that, could she?
Why the fuck not?

Too much trouble, thats why.

I was too much fucking trouble
for everybody!

My whole fucking life, everyone I met,
too much trouble!

Let me tell you something,
you get it together.

Find a way to make it all right!
Dont think you will, but you do!

-You feel sorry for yourself, dont you?
-I got this really good little trick.

You see, youre not human anymore!
None of you! Youre not human!

Youre like goldfish! All of you!

-One dies, I get another one!
-You want human? Ill give you human!

Youre going to blow the back
of your head off!

Or jump, or hang or do anything
to turn off the pain! Arent you?

-Admit it!
-Im warning you!

Youre gonna do it and you know it!

Take your hands off me!

When you finally do, when all your charm...

...and all the wonderful things
that you could be are gone forever...

...Ill just be left here...

...with an intensely human,
unprofessional rip in my heart.

That terrifies the hell out of me.

-Elizabeth.
-What?

What the hell are we doing here?

I dont know.

Would that be a problem for you, Libbie?

Sorry?

Would it be a problem for you
to supervise some additional cases?

No. No, of course not. Thats fine.

Dr. Bowen?

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

You have the most beautiful smile.

I just wanted to say, ´Hello.´

Youre a doctor. You can fix my life.

Right?

-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah, just a sec. Did you see this?

I want to take myself off the Jones case...

...and I was hoping
that you could take over.

-Why?
-What?

Why?

Because I really think its for the best.

The best?

Its not the best for me.

I slept with him.

You want to say that again.

I slept with him.

For Christs sake! What the fuck
do you think you were doing?

Twelve years of training as a psychiatrist,
and you blow it off!

First of all, youll be fired.

Then, if Mr. Jones, solid,
stable citizen that he is...

...chooses to press charges,
you could be prosecuted.

You could go to jail.

You could go to fucking jail!
Do you understand that?

-Ill resign.
-Great! Fine! Beautiful.

You fuck one of the patients...

...and all the rest of them lose
one of the best therapists--

Patrick, please. Help me.

Okay. Come here.

All right, this is the deal.

You cannot see him again.

-I have to see him once to explain.
-Libbie, listen to me.

You cannot see him again.
If you do, I will turn you in.

This is not about protecting myself,
the hospital. Its about him, the patient.

It has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

I would do that. Do you understand?
I would turn you in.

Do you understand me?

-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

There is a line here, all right?
You cannot cross it.

You dont understand.
Its too late. Its too late.

Then Im gonna transfer him
to another hospital.

Mr. Jones?

Will you please come back?

Mr. Jones, come back!

Mr. Jones!

Come back!

Are you in there?

Mr. Jones, can I help you?

Elizabeth!

Elizabeth!

Maybe I can help you?

I dont think you can.
Elizabeth can help me.

Youll be moved to another hospital.

Excellent facility.

In the meantime, Dr. Rosen will be glad
to help you. Lets go back to the unit.

I dont care about you or him.

If Elizabeth wants me transferred,
I want her to tell me to my face.

Lets talk about it back at the unit.
She cannot talk to you right now.

Dont touch me. I said dont touch me.

Thats okay.

Dont fucking touch me!

Libbie?

Patrick.

Good morning.

-What time is it?
-Its 8"00 p.m.

Im so tired.

Listen, I just wanted to let you know that...

...hes out.

Who told you?

I have a friend whos a resident at Cal.
They assessed him as being stable...

...and found him co-operative
with the drug program.

So he got himself released.

Why are you telling me?

-He may try to contact you.
-No.

No, he wont.

Not me, not anymore.

Im dead.

Hello?

-I´m trying to contact Dr. Bowen.
-This is Dr. Bowen.

I eat take-out Chinese food, right?

I´m not afraid of death.

People build it up to be something...

...that you should be frightened of, but...

...I´m so ready.

It would be a big relief, actually.

Like a warmth.

Dr. Bowen?

Do you think I´m pretty?

It was like that day we went to the pier
and I got up on the railing.

You thought it was stupid, right?

I can see now you still do.
Yeah, really dumb.

Yeah, I´m going to fall and break my neck.
What´s the point, right?

You see, you don´t understand.
Being up there is the point.

They´re willing to risk everything to get it.

Hi, Elizabeth.

What would you risk everything for?

Is there anything that means
that much to you?

You´re going to listen to this later?
I hope you do.

Save this one, this was a good one.

Whats up?

Whats this?

-Its my resignation.
-Whatd you do? Kill somebody?

Ive made a mistake.

Ive done something very bad.

Jones?

Hey, buddy.

-Your bike?
-Yeah.

-68.

-Yeah.

-Guess.

-Yes!

Its not necessary.

Now, the kids would really like
to see you, you know.

Why dont you park the bike,

How does that sound?

Why dont you ask your wife first?
Ask her.

-I aint got to ask my wife.
-I dont feel right about it. Ask her.

All right. Hey, Thiel!

-No, man, go on.
-All right. Dont you go nowhere, okay?

No, Im....

-Got to!

Dad!

Shit! Hey, man!

-Yes?

-I dont work there, Mandy.
-I´m sorry, there´s a man--

I dont work there anymore!

There´s a man who´s a friend of Mr. Jones.
He thinks Jones is gonna try and fly again.

Mr. Jones!

Mr. Jones!

I wanted to fly so much.

But I cant.

I know.

Im sorry.

So...

Cup of coffee?

Okay.
