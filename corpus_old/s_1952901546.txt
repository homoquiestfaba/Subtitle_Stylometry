Youre Machinata Dontyou live by some sort of code?

FineYou canwinyour freedom bya game of chance

Ready?

High roller wins

lll take twogarbage bags

The kindwith the laminated seams

lll takethattogo

lm not that easy

lve gotsomeone who wants to talk to you

Busy day

Shell be back for thatlater

Wheredyou go?

One minute youre there

And the next

lm standing alone atAxtonGate,

holding the only evidence thatwould link usto thatjob

l hadto go

To meet me at Bighorn?

ltwas crawlingwith troops

l know

lwas inthat detention center for nine weeks

Did they payyou?

Sure they did

Howaboutsome of thatmoney,then?

lm behind on mytarrifs and the order isaksing for myhead

Thats nothing comparedto the job lve gotlined up for you

Look at this

Tira CoronaGeneral of the RepublicanArmy

Closest thing to a revolutionagainst the Zitan Colonial Forces that the
sector can dredge up

Whowantsher dead?

Whyisitalways aboutkilling for you?

Cantyoujuststeal something once in a while?

Shesgota lostand found propostionAnd a big bankroll

Whatmakesyou think thatlwould be stupid enough
togetinvolved in another one ofyour jobs?

Because you cant get enough ofme

Dontworry, lm going downwithyou this time

Whatdo you think youre doing?

l already told her youre taking the job

Youre the besttracker, the bestshadowinthis sector

Andof course, lm the bestmiddle man

Well, l prefer italone

You putme offgroupwork forever

However lf the fee isright,

andyou can getme outof this tightspotwiththe Machinata

What else are you goingto do?

Collectbounty on four-figure screwheadsforever?

The fee is right

lwouldnthave suggested it otherwise

Andyouknow lm goodfor it

Do l?

No

Butyou have no other choice,Antigone

And neither doyou

Tell me more about this General

Are you sleepingwith her?

Busy?

Nope

Canyou help me?

Why?

Justthoughtitwouldbe nice,
you being the local constabulary andall

Whatare we supposed todo,exactly?

Whats going on outhere?

Can l helpyou?

Ransom for a wantedfugitive

GortyHex Says treason here

Whats thatpaying these days?

Three thousand

Youre right ltis

Thought thatwas you

Does your daddyknowyoure outhere?

Your cardsnotworking

Really?

No ls cash okay?

Yeah l guess

Letme guess:

You guys joinedfor the action

GortonHex, inaccordance with martial lawEdict9235,

you are hereby sentenced to execution,via injection squad

Anylastrequests?

Fine,then

Wait,you bastards

ltis dictated bylaw that l divulge the sequence
ofinjection to the convicted

Youwill be injectedthree times
Once byeach one ofus

One syringe containsVistersine,
a lethal compoundwhen mixed --

With Zoxin,which isin another syringe

The thirdsyringe contains a placebo

None ofus issure who haswhich drug,

Andin thiswaynone ofushas tolive with the guilt
of administeringthe fatal dose

ln my opinion however,

thisis an extreme waste ofmanpower

And its notmuch fun

lhate itwhen they getall foamylike that

Hey, Ugly

What took you so long?

l died thistime l really died

And then lsaw thisbrightlight

And l moved towardsthatlightbecause l thoughtitmightbe

You!And then l could strangle you for having killedme

Relax

Relax? Thats easy for youto say!
lts notyour neckin the noose

Could be worse

How?

Could have stayed dead

LookYou donthave to doit for much longer

l onlyhave twoof the antidotesleft

l do have eight ofthe poison sets ifyoud prefer

Thirteen,fourteen Fifteenfor youAnd fifteen for me

Howmanypoisons didyou sayyou had left?

Eight

l have an idea onhow to make a lotmore money faster

Save itThis scam doesnthurtanyone
and thatsjust the wayl like it

Sir,nine of the planetary governors are confirmed dead,

the others are still missing Presumably still in hiding

And Planetfall?

We mustassume ithas been confiscated bythe locals

There isAndwe have him here

Tell me everythingAnd talk fast

ltboggles the mind

Are youkidding? l love the way the armyis
letting me getin touchwith nature

Yeah, but three cases ofspace potatoeseach?

Sometimesthe punishment doesnt fit the crime

BUTTHlS TlME lT DOES!

Oooh, theywere SOworthit

Liles LavelleYouve both been activated for duty

Weve beenordered toenter theVolcano Zone
and pick up a drop shipment thatwentmissing there

Whyus, sir? Were the biggestlosers l know

lfitsworth thatmuch,whatevers in it
isa lotmore trouble than that

lll need toknowwhatitis

Alarge sum ofmoneywasstolenfrom the Republican Treasury

Asyou cansee from the size ofthe crate, itsall hardcurrency

We think the President of Zita appropriated it,
and itshidden down there somewhere

Justhowmuchmoney are we talking about?

Alotmore than seventy-five thousand

Whydontyou get one ofyour soldiers todo the job?

Letme letyou inon a little secret,kiddo
