<i>Hang on. That doesn't make any...</i>

<i>Speed, spirit and a very large...?</i> [exhales]

<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

[boy grunts, pants]

<i>If I'm gonna tell this story...</i>


<i>- I've got to catch you up on everything.</i>
[grunting]


this town once, Baltese.</i>

<i>Oh, you should have seen it.</i>

[whimsical music playing]
<i>- Which I guess you are now, so, good.</i>

<i>The sort of place
where everything felt possible</i>

<i>or even magical,</i>

<i>like that lady
making the fountain go nuts.</i>

Check this out!

doing some sophisticated, magical...</i>


<i>Inappropriate!</i>

[clears throat]Â <i>Anyway,
times changed, like times do.</i>

<i>And let me tell you, it wasn't good.</i>

<i>There was the Great Foreign War,
and after that,</i>

<i>people in Baltese just stopped believing.</i>

[sad music plays]

[sighs]
<i>- Nothing felt possible or magical,</i>

<i>and then the clouds rolled in.</i>

<i>Strange clouds that never break
or budge or snow.</i>

<i>The town's been stuck,
but things are about to get unstuck.</i>

<i>I mean, otherwise, why would I tell
this story? That'd be pretty boring.</i>


<i>Peter is an orphan
being raised by an old soldier.</i>

<i>The soldier knows about fighting
and hardship and danger,</i>

<i>so he's training the boy
for that kind of life.</i>

<i>But the boy knows there must be more.</i>

Peter, other children have families,

but as orphan, you have a rare privilege.

You can devote yourself to soldier's life.

Attention.

Here is coin for today.

Get our fish and bread now

before you begin your marching.

Older bread the better,
bread to make your teeth... strong,

and small fish
so you are accustomed to hunger.

For what are we?
We're soldiers, sir.

And what is this?
The world.

And what is the world?

Hard.

[upbeat music plays]


[bike honks]
[gasps]

[woman humming]

Good morning, Mrs. Taylor.
Good morning, Peter.

[Mrs. Taylor] Hmm.

Are you going to the opera tonight, madam?

Certainly. The only thing
I enjoy in this town.

Good morning.

Ah, Peter, I saved you
a beautiful piece today

that you can't refuse.


I know.Â I know.

Old bread and small fish.

[grunts]
[man] Careful!

No!

Hey, Peter. Here's
the most disappointing fish for you.


[man and woman grunt]

[woman] Mind yourself.
[Peter exhales]



"The most profound and difficult questions

that could possibly be posed
by the human heart or mind

will be answered
for the price of one coin."

[Peter gasps]

One coin.

[horse steps approaching]

I have to know.

Whoa.

Your Guardian Vilna Lutz will be angry
if you return without dinner.

How do you know that?

But you must ask yourself,

one day without food
or the rest of your life without knowing?


[whimsical music plays]

[Peter grunts]

[tense music plays]

[Fortune Teller] Mm.

She lives.

What?



How do you...?
One coin, one question.

Careful.


Well, my family died in the war when I was
three years old. There was a battle...

There was a battle.

Vilna Lutz rescued you,
and he's raising you to be a soldier.

What?
I know.

When my father died, my mother...

She was expecting a child. I also know.

Sergeant Lutz told me
that during the birth,

both she and the baby died, but...

But you remember?


Your sister?

My sister. [inhales]

She was so small and she was...

Alive. Yes.

Why did Vilna Lutz tell me...?
No.

You will only get one question,
so be careful.

Will I ever see her...?

Stop! Stop and think for a moment.

Think of the right question, Peter.

[tense music plays]

How do I find her?

Yes, good. Very good.

And the answer is...

follow the elephant.

[whimsical music plays]

You're having fun with me.
You have your answer.

"Follow the elephant?"
I gave you our one coin for today.

You made a choice. You asked a question.

And you cheated me.

Follow the elephant and you'll find her.

But there aren't any elephants here!

Just as you say.

[music ends]


[sighs]
[stomach rumbling]

We have no dinner tonight
because of Fortune Teller?

Yes, sir, but she knew
so much about me! About you! I...

How could she know about me?
I do not even know about me.

She said that my sister lives

and to follow an elephant.

An elephant? Your sister?

I know, sir. You've told me
all these years that my sister...


Your poor mother, your sister.

Both of them died.

I saved you,
which was all that I could do!

But I...


Kitchen cabinet.


A storybook? Who is Romain De Smedt...?

Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Romain De Smedt drive me crazy.

Young soldier I served with, good boy.

But he read this book at night
which remind him of home,

of mother, of comfort.

I had to cure him of all of this.

So I stole De Smedt's book.
[gasps]

What?

And it worked.

Without this book, he turned
into the most fearsome soldier in army.

Why are you telling me this?

Where there is comfort,
there is innocence.

Where there is innocence,

there can never be soldier.

Peter, today,

you were told... a fairy tale.

One just as false as any in this book!

There are no elephants.

If there were elephants...


...I would spot them immediately!

[cats meowing]

Ah. You hear that?

Some kind of disturbance.

Hand me the spyglass.

It's just the cats.

Spyglass. Spyglass, Peter.
Spyglass! Spyglass! Peter!

[Peter yelps]


[Vilna laughs]

Amazing.

Very clever.

Yeah. That is a smart strategy.

If only I could find a pattern.

Peter, it's time to march.

Go. March, march, march.

<i>â™ª Fish are small, bread is stale â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Life is not a fairy tale â™ª</i>




<i>- â™ª Life is not a fairy tale â™ª</i>
Furry little paws.

Razor-sharp talons.


<i>â™ª Fish are small, bread is stale â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Life is not a fairy tale â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fish are small, bread is stale... â™ª</i>

Oh, what did you put in this?
[chuckles] Turmeric.

[ceiling banging]
[sighs] Really? At dinner time?

[jazz music plays]

I'm on it.

[clears throat] Excuse me? Peter?

Typically, we're spared marching
during the dinner hour.

Yes, sir.

I have to do extra because I spent
our dinner money on a Fortune Teller.

Mm. And what did they tell you?

To follow an elephant...
which doesn't exist.

Mm.

Yes.

But what if it did?



My wife, she's tired of my "what ifs."

The elephant will lead me to my sister.


marching and marching.

It's none of our business, Leo.

[chandelier shaking]


<i>Now, at the exact same time across town,</i>

<i>there was a show with...</i>

<i>No, not that guy!</i>

<i>The opening act is a magician.</i>

Thank you so much.

[piano music plays]


Mystery and wonderment!

[crowd booing]

Ace of diamonds!
[man] Nope.

The Hoops of Delirium!

[crowd booing]


[pigeon cooing]

No, no, no, no, no, no!
[crowd laughs]

Oh.

[tense music plays]

I have one final trick.


[crowd laughs]
[sighs]

I will need a volunteer.

Madam, if you please.

Please. [sighs]


[man mutters]

[crowd applauds]

Have a seat, madam.


Can we just get it over with?

[Fortune Teller]
<i>The Magician isn't great at magic,</i>

<i>but even if he was,
he realizes this crowd wouldn't care.</i>

<i>And that's what does it.</i>

<i>He decides to try a powerful spell,</i>

<i>something to restore
and revive all of Baltese.</i>

[speaks magical language]

[Fortune Teller] <i>One elegant,
invisible moment of profound change.</i>

[triumphant music plays]

Now!

[triumphant music ends]

[crowd booing]

[elephant trumpets]

[crowd screaming]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>Like I said, he's not great at magic.</i>

Let me explain!

[elephant growls]
[woman grunts]

[pigeon cooing]

[distant siren wailing]
[train rails rattling]

[Vilna snoring]

[gentle music plays]

Do you have a name?



[baby babbling]



[Peter panting]

What? What the...?

Hey! Hey, do you know what happened to
the Fortune Teller's tent that was there?

No tent there yesterday.

Mm. Was a tent once.
Maybe it was just laundry.

Or a hat. I love hats.
Great.

Does anyone know where the tent is?
The Fortune Teller!

Have you seen a tent?
[woman] ...an elephant.

An elephant? What? Wait, wait, wait!

Did you say elephant? Where is she?

They locked her up. And the Magician too.

It's just as she said.

Who did? What?

The elephant has come.

And what that means is my sister lives!
[grunts]

She lives! She lives, Mrs. Taylor!

[Mrs. Taylor] Oh, lovely!

The elephant is here!

The elephant is here!
[meows]


Ha!

[continues whistling]



The elephant is here! [grunts]

An elephant...
An elephant!

[laughs] Yes, an elephant! An elephant!
An elephant!

I knew it would come! [laughs]

I knew it would come.
You did?

No, but I had strong
and unreasonable hopes. [chuckles]

And sometimes that's enough.

She's locked up somewhere,
but I have to get her, sir.

I'll barter or sneak
or fight my way in somehow.

Yes. Yes.

But would you allow me to help?

But... how?

I'll speak to the Countess
and her advisers,

and you and I will...
We'll figure it out together.

Really?

Really.


Sir!

Sergeant Lutz!

Sir!

Elephants? Fairy tales? False hope!

[tense music plays]

No.

What?

No, sir. An elephant has arrived here!

An elephant!
An elephant will do you no good!

But it must be true, then!
My sister lives!

And I remember her.

Impossible! She died at birth.

No! I remember.


[somber music plays]

Sir,

have you ever lied to me?

What are you saying?

I'm saying she lives and I will find her.

[somber music ends]

[upbeat music plays]

[pigeon cooing]

[suspenseful music plays]

Mm.

[guard snoring]


Okay,

and... open!

[whimsical music plays]

Oh, what the...?


So, liberty!



That's unhelpful.

[door opens]

[suspenseful music plays]

You, sir! Why did you do this to me?
Now, please...

I didn't!
Oh, you most certainly did!

You brought me on stage!
[splutters] It was an accident.

Balderdash! You purposely
crushed my leg with an elephant!

No! It was... It was supposed to be...


Lilies. Yeah, that's it.

A bouquet of lilies.
Hey! What is all this?

No idea! It's outrageous!
Remove it at once.

Stand back, sorcerer! [grunts]

[guard groans]
I'm just an entertainer!

I am not entertained.

[splutters] They're only tricks.
Assault.

How could I produce an elephant on purpose
when I can't even escape from a jail cell?

Look. Freedom!

Lima beans, my least favorite legume.
[woman grunts]

You're behind bars where you belong.

I'm going to make sure you stay there.
[cell closes]

[somber music plays, ends]

Chest up, shoulders back. Breathe.

Direct, but polite.
Strong, but respectful.

[breathes nervously]

Sweaty and nauseous.

[indistinct chatter]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>The Countess, she's fair and wise,</i>

<i>and no one can remember
the last time she laughed.</i>

She can sing!
Can she sing?

Shh. Yes, Captain Matienne?

[clears throat] Thank you, Countess.

I've come to ask
where the elephant is kept.

Who sent you to ask?

Have you been approached
by a foreign power?

No. As captain of the palace guards,
I need to know.

The elephant is dangerous.
We don't even know where it came from.

The elephant is a criminal,
it is being treated as such.

A criminal? No.

This may just be the opening barrage.
Uh, what?

We must expect other beasts
to be launched at us!

Camels! Cassowaries! Crocodiles!
[crowd gasps]


We commanded the Magician
to disappear her! He says he's unable!

As such, we plan to destroy her!
[crowd gasps]

I haven't decided that.

If a boy throws a rock through a window,
can you blame the rock?

We're speaking of elephants.

You're speaking of murder!
The elephant committed a crime!

The elephant is guilty of nothing
except being an elephant!

I'll continue to consider this
until we meet tomorrow.

But let me say, Captain Matienne,

I take the safety
of our town very seriously.

She may need to be... gotten rid of.

[adviser 1] Hear.
[adviser 2] Agreed!

The only sensible solution.

[adviser 2] Quite right.

[Fortune Teller] <i>Now,
Leo Matienne sees one other way</i>

<i>to keep the elephant alive.</i>

The King.

[triumphant music plays]

Ah. [hums]

[Fortune Teller] <i>He knows two things...</i>

Mm. Huh?
<i>- ...one, The King has never been to Baltese.</i>

...over the palace wall,
landing safely in the moat.

That's impossible! I love it!

[Fortune Teller]
<i>Two, The King likes to be entertained.</i>

<i>- Only to be entertained...</i>
[man grunts]

<i>- ...and never to not be entertained.</i>
[laughs]

I love you, sir!

Hey, who wants a nougat? You like nougat?

And a doctor. And then they'll go again.
Fantastic stuff. [laughs]

"An elephant came through a ceiling
and hit an old lady."

Are you kidding? Let's go!


The King!

His Majesty wants... [huffs]

...to see the elephant!

The... The King?
Coming here?

[adviser 1] To see the elephant?
[adviser 2] Extraordinary!

[adviser 3] We must make preparations!
[adviser 2] Etcetera!

[crowd cheering]







Peter, what are you doing?
[yelps] Mr. Matienne?

I was going to come get you.

I said I'd help you see the elephant.

Oh, uh, I guess I just...

I... I'm just not used to that.

Help.

Come on.


[classical music plays]

Wow! You work here?


That's for the elephant?
Mm.

Captain Matienne, is everything ready?

[triumphant music plays]

Yes, yes! [laughs]

That's right! I'm The King!


Hey, everybody's here!

There's snacks!


I wish I'd been there.

Oh!


[adviser] Hear, hear.
[glass tinkling]

[people shushing]

And now, the elephant.

[drum rolling]
[crowd gasps]

[elephant growls]

[crowd gasping]

[majestic music playing]



[elephant grunts]

[elephant grunts, trumpets]

[crowd gasps, applauds]

You're here!

Wow!
Ooh!

My word!

[elephant trumpets]

The sheer dimension of her!

[elephant trumpets]
[groans]

Wow. Would you look at that.

I must admit,
she is a magnificent creature.

She certainly is.

[elephant trumpets, groans]

[trumpets]
She seems agitated.

Something's not right.


Her eye.


[man] Can those chains hold her?
[trumpets]

[crowd screaming]

[elephant trumpeting]

Protect them!

[crowd screaming]


Shoot it!Â Shoot it!

No! No!

No!

Rifles down! Peter.

[Peter panting]

[elephant grunting]

[elephant trumpets]
[Peter grunts]

Peter!
I'm okay.Â I'm okay.

[trumpeting, grunting]


Come.

[elephant exhales]

[Peter shushes] It's okay.Â It's okay.

[elephant trumpeting]

[elephant exhales]


[elephant snorts]

[elephant grunting]

[elephant squeals]

[Peter laughs]

[upbeat music plays]

[crowd gasps]

[elephant trumpets]

[man] You did it!
[kid] Oh my God!

[crowd cheers]


Peter, ma'am.

Peter, I'm grateful.

I'd like you to stay at the palace
and tend to my elephant.

The elephant is staying here?

[elephant grunting]

No, thank you, ma'am.

Oh.
The kid's got pluck. [laughs] I love it!

I need the elephant to lead me
to my lost sister. It is my destiny.


[crowd laughs]

I must ask you to give her to me.

The elephant is very dangerous, Peter.
That's impossible.

I happen to like impossible things.

Hey, what if Peter
does three impossible things

in exchange for one?

We're here for three days.

Each day, I'll pick something
impossible for the kid to do,

and if he does all three, thus proving
his valor, strength, blah blah blah,

he gets the elephant.

If not, I'll take it back with me.

Well, I'm not sure...

It's a deal!
You're terrific, Countess. [laughs]

I like this place more and more,
wherever we are.

[clears throat]
Okay, the first impossible task is...

a fight!

[crowd gasps]

A fight?
Sure!

Who doesn't like a fight?

And an impossible fight
is the best kind, right?

Stands to reason, sir.
The kid's up for it! I told you.

Right? He's got some idea
about the elephant.

And destiny and...
Uh...

the kid fights my toughest soldier.

[crowd gasps]
Oh no.

Pistols or sabers?
Um...

Sabers it is! I love this kid!
Give him my saber, Henri.

It's all yours.

Unless you get killed, in which case,
you know, I'll take it back.

Peter, has any of your training
included sabers?

No, sir. Broomsticks a bit.
Mm...

Meet me at the store, if you like.
I'll try to teach you.

[triumphant music plays]

Tomorrow, at noon.

[crowd cheers]


<i>DÃ©robement</i>!

Yes! [grunts]

En garde!

Lunge!
[grunts]


Counter-parry!

[both grunting]

[laughs]
[grunts]

Yes! [growls]

[sighs, laughs]

I'm getting better.
Absolutely.

Oh, madness. How can the boy win?

What if he does?

What if?

Your "what ifs" will be
the end of us, Leo Matienne.

I beg your pardon, ma'am. But how can
two small words be so dangerous?

In Leo Matienne's hands is how.

What if we put all our savings
into raising pygmy goats?

A perfect pet. [laughs]

If they could've been trained
not to eat floors and walls.

What if we import rare goods
from the Far East?

Would've worked.

If the entire shipment
had not been eaten by pygmy goats.

They didn't eat the silks.

Ah-ha! Yes, the silk.

You see this roll of silk?

My husband wanted to use it
to kill himself.

It's called a parachute,
and there is evidence it can work.

Has it ever worked?
[Leo] No.

Actually, the results have been
quite grisly. That's true.

But what if I had been the first?





I'm going to practice on the mannequins.

[Peter grunting]



[goat bleating]
[Peter grunting]

Tireless and kind.

Leo...
But with no one to love him.

Don't say it.

And the two of us downstairs, all alone.

No, we've tried and failed. [sighs]

God does not intend for us
to have children,Â Leo Matienne.

And who are we to say what God intends?

Please.

My heart has been broken too many times.

It cannot bear your foolish questions.

But how? How will the world ever change
if we do not question it?

The world cannot be changed.

The world is what the world is
and forever has been.

No.

I won't believe that.

For here is Peter, standing before us,

asking us to make it something different.


<i>Coup d'arrÃªt</i>.

[goat bleating]
[Peter grunting]

[upbeat music plays]


[Sister snoring]


Oh. Adele, my dear!

Are you well?
I dreamt of an elephant, Sister.

Oh, but how lovely.

I find elephant dreams
particularly moving and portentous,

although I'm forced to admit that
I myself have neverÂ dreamt of an elephant.

It felt like the elephant
came to take me somewhere.

Oh, but you belong right here,
dear child, where you're safe.

Hmm. Safe from what, Sister?

From the world.

I went out to see the world, Adele,
and it was cruel.

So I brought you home to the orphanage,

far away from everything.

And I named you Adele after your mother,

who's in heaven now with your brother.

Mm. Do you think elephants have names?

Oh, yes. All creatures have names, dear.

Every last one of them.

[gentle music plays]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>The elephant also has dreams.</i>

[triumphant music plays]

<i>The elephant's with her family...</i>

<i>and she hears her name spoken.</i>

[baby elephant groans]

<i>Somewhere she's known,
somewhere she's loved.</i>





[groaning]
[chains clanking]

[groaning]
[chains clanking]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>She definitely doesn't belong here.</i>

<i>It all seems impossible.</i>

[elephant sighs]

[elephant groaning]

[elephant blowing softly]

Hey.

[groaning]
[shushes] It's all right, it's okay.

It's all right.

We met earlier, with the water.

Yeah, that was me.

You may not know it yet, but...

you've been brought here
to find my sister.

Uh, I don't know where she is.

To win you, I have to fight
The King's toughest soldier tomorrow.


But I thought instead,

all you have to do
is just point on this map

and show me where my sister is.

[elephant blows]

On... on the map.

Show me on this map here where she is.

Okay?
[growls]

All right.

[elephant grunts]

Just gotta point where...

Point where my sister is.

[elephant trumpets]
[yelps, laughs]


Are you a magic talking elephant?

Can you tell me where she is?

Can you speak? Just speak. Say it.

Say it.

Can you say it?

[exhales, trumpets]

Hey! [laughing]

[elephant grunting]


Well...

Looks like I have to fight tomorrow.

[groans]
So, I better keep practicing.

[elephant growls]

[elephant trumpets softly]

[elephant squeaking]


Thank you.



[upbeat music plays]

What's happening?

There's a boy fighting for the elephant.

[triumphant music plays]

[elephant trumpets]

[crowd cheers]

[tense music plays]

It's time.



Peter, <i>posta breve</i> then <i>moulinet</i>!
Remember, with the spin!

[all gasp]




[crowd murmurs]

Oh no.


Oh, brilliant!

This is Sergeant De Smedt!

Huh? De Smedt?

[gasps]
[King] A chase!





Whoa, whoa, whoa!


[De Smedt panting]

Mm?

[growling softly]

[goat screaming]




[goat bleating]


I need the biggest fish you have, sir!

Peter?
[chuckles]

What are you doing...?
Take this as payment. [straining]


Magnificent and versatile!
[shushes] Please!

[growls]
Oh no!

Thanks!
Oh!


Yes!

Magnificent and versatile.

[cat screaming]

Stiffen the wicks.

The situation has escalated.

There's a clear command structure.

I must find a way

There he is!

and everyone lived happily ever after.

Well, that's all for tonight,
little carrot.

Mama, please? Just one more.

All right, carrot. Just a teeny.

[Peter pants]


[crowd murmurs]


In combat, I mean.

Do you believe a person can change?

in battle, Sergeant.

I think anything's possible.


[triumphant music plays]


Hooray!
[crowd cheers]


Yeah! [laughs]
[woman] Yay!

[goat bleating]




[crowd cheering]

I'm kind of amazed that worked.


You've done the first impossible task.

You've also lost my priceless family saber

and ruined a perfectly good
killing machine.

"Hello," said Mr. Pig.
"Hello," said Mr. Rooster.

You're a surprisingly weird
and dangerous young man.

And I like that.
[grunts] Thank you, sir.


Now, tomorrow,
for the second impossible task...

Uh... [mutters]

[elephant snuffling]

Uh, you will fly!

Huh? Fly? I... But...
[man] Fly?

How?
Hello? It's supposed to be impossible.

The kid just beat Goliath.
You want him to bob for apples?

Plus, we've had some people nearly fly.

What? I...

Right? Nearly.
[grunts]

Okay, great.

Tomorrow at noon,
we'll all meet in the square

and watch the kid fly or crash or both.

Both could be funny.

Like, like he really gets going
but then, whammo!

[laughs]
[crowd gasps]

No, of course not. No. Um... [clears throat]

So, until then...

[crowd chatting indistinctly]

[trumpeting softly]

[dramatic music plays]

[grumbling softly]

[elephant grumbling]

I will get you water,
and then I will learn how to fly

and then I will get you out of here.

And we can find my sister.

[Fortune Teller] <i>The elephant cannot
understand human speech,</i>

<i>but she can look at a face
and recognize friendship.</i>

<i>She doesn't feel well,</i>

<i>but she does finally
feel something like... hope.</i>


<i>And hope can spread
from one person to the next.</i>

He ran off like lightning!
I know! I saw it with my own eyes.

He bestowed upon me this sword
in exchange for one cod.

I can't wait to see
what he has to do next.

I'm going early to get a good spot.

[man 1] Like an avenging librarian!

[boy] Incredible! Who knows what's next?
[man 2] It could be anything.

[horse neighing]


An elephant!

[laughs]
[kids] <i>â™ª Bake me a cake as fast as... â™ª</i>

Sister! Sister! It's... an elephant!

In the hydrangeas?

In the city!

An elephant has appeared
under miraculous circumstances.

We must go!

No, no, no, no! We do not go to the city.

It is unsafe. Some harm could befall you.

But... my dream. This is a sign.


Yes, you do.

Yes. [scoffs]

I do, in fact, believe in signs.

Very well, dear.

[laughs]
Oh!

Perhaps you do not understand.
My legs were crushed!

By an elephant!

[Fortune Teller]
<i>Yes, she comes here every day.</i>

Every day.

Every day.

Oh, look who's back.

[cooing]
Traitor.

[woman] My legs were crushed!
Go get help, boy.


I know, your legs were crushed
by an elephant.

But for the last time,

I just intended a bouquet of lilies.

Just admit you crushed my legs
with your tricks.

It was an accident.
I intended a bouquet of lilies.

Lilies!



Stop all that! Just stop!



[cooing]
[purring]

[metal clanks]

[Vilna grumbling]

Peter... [grunts]

[metal clanks]

Stop this minute!

Sir...
Soldiers do not fly! I forbid it!

Sir, I...
No!

Now, you listen.

With De Smedt, you were lucky,

but this... this flying...

It is impossible.

I beat De Smedt, and I believe I will fly!

And I believe
you will be crushed flat. Dead.

Dead like your sister!

[gasps softly]

Huh? Oh...

[chair scraping]
Watch me!

[door opens, closes]


[screams]
[music skips]


Peter, what's wrong?

I have to fly tomorrow,

but I have no idea how to do that.

Vilna says that I'm going to die.

Like I don't know!

Like I don't already know.

I have to fly tomorrow. I have to.

Come inside. You need to eat.


[cutlery clanking]

Eat now.



What do you call this?

Stew, dear.

[gentle music plays]

[goat moans]

now, about this flying business.


[owl hooting]

[Adele grunts, giggles]


[purrs]
Hello, honey.

As soon as you see the elephant,

we're going back to the orphanage
where we're safe.

Help you with your luggage, Sister?
Oh!

Quickly, dear. Quickly.
[owl hooting]

Now you see why
we don't travel to the city, Adele.

Danger at every turn.

[tense music plays]


Peter.

[breathes deeply]

Peter, where are you?

[dog barking]

[baby crying]


If only I'd kept the boy. The boy.

[baby crying]

[Vilna] <i>We're retreating to the garrison.</i>
[mutters]

[man laughs]

Oh.


Go! Go! Go, go!

[soldier 1 groans]
Run!

Retreat!

[baby crying]

[soldier 2] Fall back!

[baby crying]

Hello? Hello?

[baby crying]
[Sister shushes]


Please, listen.
You have to get out of here.

We're retreating to the garrison.

Their mother, is she...?

[bomb explodes]

Take the children. I'll meet you there.

I'm a soldier.
I don't know how to care for a newborn.

Of course. Just the boy, then.

Please, I can't do it alone.

All right. But you have to leave at once.

I'll gather things for the baby
and meet you at the garrison. Now, go!

[dramatic music plays]
[shots fired]

I should have taken them both.

I'm so sorry, young man.

But I'll keep you safe.

I'm a soldier.

[dramatic music intensifies]

[sighs deeply]

Peter.

Oh, the boy with me.



[Sister gasps] The garrison!

Is there anyone left?

No more survivors!

<i>It's not safe here, Sister!
The enemy is coming!</i>

If only I'd kept the boy with me.




[Fortune Teller] <i>A new day.</i>
Hey, everybody! Hello!

[Fortune Teller] <i>A new impossible task.</i>

<i>And the same impossible King.</i>

Great day to watch the kid fly, eh?
Not a cloud in the...

Oh, strike that.

It's a shame, really,

because, you know, with a tan... [chuckles]

...I become irresistible.



I'm still King, right?
I didn't miss a coup or something.

[whimsical music plays]

Does she ever laugh?

Never?

Like, not ever?

Not since her brother died in the war.

[somber music plays]

Oh dear.

[crowd cheers]

[upbeat music plays]

[elephant trumpets]

Yeah!

They said the elephant would be here.
Can you see her, Sister?

Ooh!
[crowd gasps]

[Adele grunting]

[laughs]
Stay close, dear.

[elephant trumpets]

No, stay with me! Stay with me!
[crowd cheers]


How's everybody doing?

Yes, it's me! [laughs]

Okay. Let's see something impossible.
Uh, where's the kid?

Up there!

[crowd gasping]


[suspenseful music plays]

[panting nervously]

Well, that doesn't seem smart.

[Leo gasps]

He'll be all right.
Uh-huh. Yes, sure.



No, no, no, no, no.

Whoa.

[suspenseful music intensifies]

Whoa!

Ah!

Ahh! [panting]

[both gasp]

[gasp]
[trumpets]


No!

What is it?
The boy, he slipped.







[triumphant music plays]
Phew.


[suspenseful music plays]

Ugh!
[meows]

Humph!



This was a fantastic idea!

[suspenseful music intensifies]

[breathes deeply]

I will find her.


[all gasp]

Now, Peter!


Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[all cheering]




[crowd cheers]
[child] Peter!


[sighs]
[laughs]


[Peter whooping]

Wow.

I knew it!

I knew the kid could fly!




[laughing wildly]

You are flying, Peter!

You are flying!

What is possible?
It's possible! It's possible!

It's possible! [yelling]Â Peter!

[trumpeting]
[crowd cheering]

He's flying!

[all laugh]

Oh!

Whoa!

Peter!

[Peter wailing]


Sorry! Excuse me! [grunts]
[crowd screaming]


[crowd gasps]

[Peter straining]

[crowd cheering] Peter!

[man 1] Amazing, Peter! [laughs]

[man 2] Whoa! Wonderful, Peter!

Ah!

Whoa! [laughs]

[chuckles]
[Adele] Yay, Peter! Great job!

[grunting]
[crowd chants] Peter! Peter! Peter!

[crowd groans]

[Peter groaning]

Yeah!

[crowd] Yeah!
Yes! Whoo!

All right, I flew! What's next?

Well, you've done
the second impossible task,

so, you are one step away
from owning an elephant!

[King chuckles]

It doesn't sound great when I say it
out loud. A lot of cleaning up.

Huge. Anyway. Okay. Good.
[crowd laughing]

Okay, for the third impossible task...
[scoffs]

[tense music plays]
[King hesitates]

Uh...

I don't have it yet.

kind of king, you know?

I... I come up with things
on the fly, you know?

Always winging it. [chuckles]

[elephant grunts]

It's a joke. God, it's a quip, but...

[whimsical music plays]

Aha!

Nope. Nope. Sorry. Stand down, son.

I just get like this when I'm about
to say something incredible.



For your third impossible task...

you will make the Countess laugh.

What?
[crowd gasps]

What?
[groans]

Oh.

They keep doing this.

What part of impossible
is tripping you people up?

Im, not. Poss, the middle part...
Im... Something...

Okay, I have no idea, but it means

"impossible!"

Plus, this kid's a killer.

Anyone thinks they're better
than this kid,

you're next jumping off
the cathedral wearing a tent.

Remember that.

You should stop worrying about the kid
and figureÂ out who'll get me an ice cream.

Preferably butter pecan.

Anyone? Hello?
Why are we all standing here?

[whimsical music plays]

Oh! Adele!

[man grunts]
[gasps]



Hello.

It's me, from the dream. Do you remember?

[elephant exhales]

I'm here. Can you tell me why?



I mean, she never laughs.

[elephant grunts]
Not ever.

Maybe they'd let me
jump off the cathedral again.

I could write you a joke.

Sorry?

You're probably just not very funny.

Right, and I'm sure you're hilarious.

[grunts]
Ow!


Ow.

Very sorry, miss.

It's unlike me
to say something so insulting.

And I've never hit a person in my life.

Please forgive me.

But I...
[Sister] Oh, there you are!

I was looking everywhere.

Are you all right?

Yes, Sister.

Well, now that you've seen the elephant...

[elephant blows]
Hello, madam.


Did she tell you anything?

No.

Very good, dear!

Now we can go home.

But, Sister...

We'll get a good night's sleep,
then go back to where we belong.

[sad music plays]
[elephant sighs]

[elephant snuffles]



Hmm.



I get muddled sometimes, Peter,

little unclear about things.

I want you to know

I am perfectly clear

what I have to say right now.

[melancholy music playing]

You are right.

She was alive.


The little girl was alive.

[chokes back tears]

I could have saved her.

I left her with the nurse.

We were supposed to meet at the garrison,
but there was an explosion.

I could tend to you both.

I'm a soldier, Peter.

[voice breaking] What do I
know about an infant?

We make these decisions

in war, in life.

We have only a moment.

[exhales sharply]

I could have saved you both.

I didn't.

And I lied

because I didn't want
to cause you any more pain.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Sir...

did you see her dead?

My sister?

No.

Then anything is possible.

Well...

you spoke of impossible elephants...

and were correct.

Sir?

You stood before an impossible opponent...

and you were victorious.

Then today...


...I saw you fly!


You.

You are what is possible.

One more task tomorrow.

Well, then, tell me a joke.

A horse walked into a bar.
Um, maybe it can't walk into it.

No, no! That's not funny.

No.
[bleats]

[Peter sighs]

Oh, yes.

[laughs]
[bleats]



Yes, that is funny!

[goat bleats]



Madam LaVaughn,

I've lied to you.

Oh!

Finally, an admission.

No, I didn't mean to hurt you
or make an elephant appear,

but I wasn't trying
for a bouquet of lilies either.


When I stood on that stage
facing all of you,

your disbelief...

[crowd booing]
[magician sighs]

...it... it made my heart break.

Even now, you see magic right before you,

things conjured from nothing.


Granted, a fractured magic,
sloppy, accidental, but...

magic.

To which you respond, "Stop,"
as you would to some minor nuisance.

What has happened here?

That night, I tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there.

A spell to make you believe again,

to care about magic,

because extraordinary things are possible.

If you believe!

But I had no business
attempting such a powerful spell,

because I'm not a very good magician.

[cat meows]

I tried for mystery and wonderment.


[insects chirping]

[elephant groans]
I know.

I know you're worried
about the Countess laughing,

but I've got a great joke.

And I've got it under control.
You gotta trust me.

[snuffles and trumpets softly]

Hey! [laughs]

I feel like you're not taking me
seriously. I'm a dangerous man.

I beat a giant, I jumped off a building.
[blows]

Okay. okay. There'll be plenty of time
for messing about later.

We just have to concentrate
on the final task, but...



Oh, I can't wait to get you out of here.

We're gonna have so much fun
and so many adventures...


...finding my sister.

[elephant squeaks]
Hmm.

[dramatic music plays]

[Peter laughs]

[elephant trumpeting]

Wow!


Ya! [laughs]

[trumpets]
[laughs]

[elephant squeals happily]

Woo-hoo!


Whoa!



[elephant trumpets]


[upbeat music plays]

[elephants trumpeting]

[baby elephant trumpets]

[elephant squeals]



<i>Peter!</i>

<i>- Peter! Peter! Peter!</i>
[yelps]


Peter.

Peter.

Hey, wake up. It's time now.


Everyone's here, Peter. The third task.



[elephant grunts]

[elephant grunts]

You must really miss them. I thought
you were taking me back to my family.

[elephant sighs]

I need to get you back to yours.

It's time for the third impossible task!

Will the kid finally win
the elephant? [laughs]

[elephant groans]
[crowd cheers]

Yes, I will.

[breathes deeply]

I hear the Countess laugh,

you walk away with the elephant.

[crowd applauds]
[exhales]

Proceed.



So, there's a farmer and a fisherman.

They're out in a field together.
Solid start. Classic.

When they hear
a funny kind of croaking noise,

they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen.

The hen's got this piece of string,

and she's working the string
in and out of the mouth

of a frog by the pond,

up and down with the string
in the frog's mouth.

So, the fisherman says,
"Why do you think the hen's doing that?"

The farmer turns
to the fisherman and says,

"Well, sure, it's the same question
as always, isn't it?"

[chuckles]
Huh? Huh?

"Why did the chicken floss the toad?"

[crowd groans]

Funny stuff, Peter! Funny stuff!

[crowd sighs]



Oh, I get it.

Why did the chicken...?
Because it sounds like...

[laughs forcefully]

Hold on.Â Hold on.

That's not a real laugh.

If you're not gonna take this seriously,
Countess, then what's the point?

Sorry, kid, you failed.

[crowd groaning]

Oh, Peter.

[elephant sighs]

No.

What? No?

You have to let me take her,

but not for me, for her.

[elephant groans]

All this time, I've tried to win
the elephant to find my family,

but she has a family
and she was taken from them.

Peter, what about your sister?

The elephant might have a sister too.

Why is mine more important?

I know the joke didn't work,

but please, the elephant didn't ask
to be brought here.

We have to send her home.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Man, you almost had me.

But no.

You had one last thing to do,
and I don't see her laughing.

Grab the elephant and we'll roll.

[elephant trumpeting]

No! No! No!

[elephant stops trumpeting]

Okay, I know. This is impossible.

But what if it wasn't?

Just think for a moment.

Think of all
of the impossible things you've done,

and you've probably done plenty.

Have you ever gotten through
one of them alone?

Of course not. That would be absurd.

Peter fought and flew and defied a king,

and maybe he feels alone.
[purrs]

But he's not.

No one is. Remember that.

[elephant trumpeting]



[elephant sniffles]


[crowd gasps]

[crowd gasps]

Oh no.

[elephant squealing]
[cat whines]



[elephant trumpeting]

[Peter chuckles]

[crowd laughs]

[laughs forcefully]

All right, kid, you did it.

What? Really?

But... but it was the elephant.

She's laughing, right?
That's all I really wanted.

Things are only impossible
till they're not.

The elephant is yours, Peter.


Glorious victory! Huzzah!

[crowd cheers]

[both laugh]


Yeah! Woo-hoo!

Yeah! [laughs]

Wow.

[laughs]
[crowd cheers]


We did it!Â We did it! [cheers]

Mm. Whoa, whoa! [laughs]

How will we get her home?

A barge across the sea!

A dirigible?

Carried over the mountains
by larger elephants!

That seemed good until I said it out loud.

[crowd laughs]

The Magician!
[crowd gasps]

[snoring]
[LaVaughn] Wake up now.

This boy says the elephant must go home.

You must make her disappear.
[coos]

You've seen what happens
when I attempt that spell.

We're lucky it wasn't worse.

Sir, the elephant deserves
to be with her family.

Yeah, that's a lovely idea,
but look around you.

My magic is all failure!

Failure?
I can't do it!

Nonsense!

You brought an elephant through the roof.
[grunts]

And don't you realize
it started something here?

The very thing you wished for.

[elephant trumpets]

Hey, magic man!
Let's send the big lady home!

[pigeon coos]

I believe that you can perform
the necessary magic.

I believe that only you
can set things right.

[dramatic music plays]

[elephant trumpets]

Sister! Sister!

Sister, please.

In my dream, I was meant to follow her.


Yes, you do.

Yes, I do, in fact, believe in dreams.

Oh, very well. [yelps]

[dramatic music intensifies]

[elephant trumpets]

Developments are afoot. [sighs]



The battle must be joined.



[dramatic music ends]

Hey, it's okay.

[elephant grunts]
It's okay.


I heard it was different here before.

There was light,
there was life, there was hope.

The perfect kind of town
to make an elephant disappear.

This is my home,

but it's not hers.

[elephant grunting]

It's hard to lose a friend.


We have to say goodbye now.

[elephant trumpets softly]


The Magician brought her here,

and I believe that he can send her home!

Do you believe?

That is how it will be accomplished.

[elephant trumpets]
[crowd gasps]

Please, sir.

[heart beating]

[elephant groaning]

[heart continues beating]

[inhales deeply]

[speaking magical language]

[elephant groaning]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>Belief is a great and invisible thing.</i>

<i>It comes over us like sleep.</i>

[crowd gasps]
[gasps]

[crowd gasps]


[triumphant music plays]

I can't believe I just saw magic!

[woman 1] What's happening?
[woman 2] Look at the clouds!

[man 1] It's magic.

[woman 3] It's clearing!
[crowd gasps]

What is it?
[laughs] It's sun, my darling.

It's good.

[woman 4] It's beautiful!
[gasps]

[man 2] Sunshine!

You were meant to follow her
to your destiny.

This was more important.


Come on now, Adele. Time to go home.

Sir, you're outside!

Yes. Yes. [chuckles]
[gasps]

Oh.

Oh.

The soldier?

You were dead.

You were dead.

Do you...?

Do you mean?




Peter.


This is... this is my sister.



You're...
Well...

First of all... Let me just say...
You're alive! And here!

[sighs]
And family!



[man 1 cheers]
[man 2] Incredible!



Oh. [laughs]


[Adele laughs]

Yeah!
[laughs]


Ow! What was that for?

No more jumping off buildings!

[woman laughs]

[Vilna laughs]


[guard chuckles]

I'm sorry for the harm
I've caused you, madam.

I beg your forgiveness.


Oh, lilies!

Thank you, my friend.

[bell dings]

Just look at the place now.

A town restored. Can you see?

for a while.

I know, but every time I try to leave,

it just seems... impossible.

Just then, the magic coral woke up

and chased the oysters away shouting...

"Begone, evil mollusks!"
[kids gasp]

"Away!"

Ooh, that was really scary.
[LaVaughn] Thank you.

[Fortune Teller] <i>A whole family created.</i>


Oh, I've got my secrets,
you know? I'm a big city lady.

Tell me you didn't make the goat
more pajamas. All he does is eat them.

Yes, but he likes eating pajamas.


[cat meows]


[Fortune Teller] <i>And as for the elephant,</i>

<i>she lives a really long time,</i>

<i>long enough to test
even an elephant's memory.</i>

<i>But of course, she never forgets Peter.</i>

<i>I mean, how could she?</i>
