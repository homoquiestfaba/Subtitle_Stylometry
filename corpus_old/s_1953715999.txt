WE'RE VERY LIKEABLE.            

  WHATEVER THIS THING IS, IT'S  
  OUR PROBLEM NOW.              

WE SHOULD CALL A TENANT MEETING.

YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE         
TENANTS ABOUT THE MONSTER THAT'S

EATING ALL THE PETS IN OUR      
BUILDING?                       

NO, NO. WE'LL LIE TO THEM.      

 BUT, UH, WE SHOULD TELL THEM   
 SOMETHING. TO...KEEP ALERT, YOU

KNOW?                           

WE SHOULD GO TO THE BAR.        

OKAY.                           

¶ DON'T LET THE DOGS...         
AS YOU KNOW, I RUN A HOME       

BUSINESS OUT OF MY APARTMENT.   

A BROTHEL IS MORE LIKE IT.      

IT'S NOT A BROTHEL, OKAY?       

 A BROTHEL HAS <i>MANY</i> PROSTITUTES.

ANYWAY, WITHOUT HEAT OR         
ELECTRICITY I CAN'T DO WHAT I   

DO, AND IF I CAN'T DO WHAT I DO,
THEN HOW ARE YOU GONNA...       

  ...HERMIT IN 205, THE ONE NO  
  ONE HAS EVER SEEN, HAS THESE  

 CRAZY BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT KEEP  
 GOING ON AND OFF AND ON AND OFF

AND...                          

 ...SPLINTERS IN THE RAILING,   
 BUT IF I DON'T USE THE RAILING,

I COULD FALL AND BREAK MY HEAD  
OPEN.                           

SO IF YOU FIND IT IN YOUR       
HEARTS, I WOULD LIKE TWO CEILING

 FANS, MOUNTED HORIZONTALLY INTO
 THE WALL...                    

...AND SHE'S PRACTICALLY        
BEGGING ME TO MOVE INTO HER     

RITZY CONDOMINIUM DOWNTOWN....  

  ...I CAN'T DO WHAT I DO, THEN 
  HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET PAID?   

...AND ON AND OFF...            

  ...APARTMENT, I GET A COLD... 

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

THAT WAS GREAT.                 

WE'VE GOT A LOT OF REALLY GOOD  
IDEAS HERE ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT...

AMELIORATE.                     

...IMPROVE YOUR SITUATIONS,     
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND  

YOUR COMMENTS.                  

OH, OH, THERE IS THIS ONE MORE  
THING.                          

ABOUT THE MISSING PETS -- SEE,  
IT'S STEMMING FROM...           

  IT <i>MIGHT BE</i> STEMMING FROM...  

...SOME SORT OF...              

ANIMAL, LIKE -- LIKE MAYBE A    
RACCOON.                        

LIKE A SLIGHTLY                 
LARGER-THAN-AVERAGE RACCOON OR  

CREATURE/CRITTER.

LARGE CRITTER?                  

LIKE -- LIKE COYOTE?            

  THE POINT IS, EVERYONE -- WE  
  JUST WANT YOU TO BE...        

  YOU KNOW, DON'T REALLY WORRY  
  ABOUT IT.                     

JUST KIND OF KEEP AN EYE OUT.   

...VIGILANT.                    

  THERE YOU GO. THAT'S A WORD.  

BE VIGILANT.                    

I LIKE THAT WORD.

START LOCKING YOUR DOOR.        

 I WON'T LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE  
 I HAVE TO TRAP MYSELF IN MY OWN

HOME.                           

EVERYONE, IT'S JUST -- WE       
JUST WANTED ALL OF YOU TO KNOW  

THAT WE'VE GOT GOOD PEOPLE.     

CAPABLE PEOPLE.                 

RIGHT. AND -- AND THEY'RE       
WORKING ON THIS.                

 AND WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT
 EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.   

RIGHT.                          

BUT BE VIGILANT.                

JUST IN CASE.                   

AND, UH, IF YOU COULD ALL       
DROP OFF YOUR RENT CHECKS ON THE

 WAY OUT, THAT WOULD REALLY HELP
 US GET STARTED ON YOUR ISSUES.

  I CAN'T HELP THINKING, IF I'D 
  BEEN A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE 

ABOUT TAKING CHANCES, LIKE YOU  
TWO GUYS, MY LIFE WOULD HAVE    

TURNED OUT DIFFERENT.           

STOP TALKING LIKE THAT,

NO.                             

SHE WAS A GOOD WRITER.          

 SHE USED TO WRITE A LOT OF PORN
 WITH HENRY MILLER.             

OH.                             

YEAH, SHE WAS A

 I'M WAY TOO DRUNK TO ARGUE WITH
 YOU RIGHT NOW, AND I JUST WANT 

TO GO TO SLEEP.                 

PUT IT BACK.

THAN THIS ONE?

I'M GONNA GO AND PHILOSOPHIZE   
WITH DAVE.                      

I'M GONNA GO THEORIZE WITH DAVE.

WHERE'S NICHOLAS?               

  HE'S STRATEGIZING WITH DAVE.  

I TOLD YOU.

 [ BUZZING ]                    
OH-HO. WHOA.                    

OH, MY.                         

I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS TO   
ADD TO THAT EARLIER LIST OF     

QUESTIONS THAT --               
FIVE YEARS AGO, THE PILOT       

LIGHT WENT OUT IN THE FURNACE,  
AND AS A FAVOR TO YOUR MOTHER, I

WENT DOWN TO RE-LIGHT IT.       

  THAT WAS CONSIDERATE OF YOU.  

YEAH, WELL...                   

"YEAH, WELL" WHAT?              

ARE YOU PANTOMIMING THAT DAVE   
AND OUR MOM HAD CRAZY JUNGLE SEX

ON EACH OTHER?                  

  THAT IS NOT INFORMATION THAT  
  IS ESSENTIAL TO THE THRUST OF 

THIS NARRATIVE, NICHOLAS.       

  SHE WAS, LIKE, 10 YEARS OLDER 
  THAN YOU.                     

15, ACTUALLY, BUT SHE WAS       
VIVACIOUS AND...UM...           

A SNAPPY DRESSER.               

THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE TO   
TALK ABOUT.                     

YOU -- YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT I   
SAW IN THE BASEMENT.            

HE WAS TRYING TO CRAWL OUT OF   
THE TRAPDOOR UNDERNEATH THE     

FURNACE.                        

TRAPDOOR UNDERNEATH THE         
FURNACE?                        

THERE'S A TRAPDOOR,             
APPARENTLY, UNDER THE FURNACE.  

BOOTLEGGER'S RUN?               

NOT JUST A CUTE NAME.           

  YES, THERE WAS A TUNNEL THAT  
  CONNECTED THE BASEMENT OF THE 

BAR TO A STILL THAT WAS IN THE  
BASEMENT OF THE CHURCH.         

 DURING PROHIBITION, MANY SECRET
 PASSAGES ALL OVER THIS GREAT   

CITY -- THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE  
HERE TO TALK ABOUT.             

SO, I SLAMMED THE DOOR ON HIS   
HEAD, RE-LIT THE PILOT, CAME    

BACK UP HERE.                   

I HAVE NOT LEFT THIS APARTMENT  
OR HAD A FULL NIGHT'S SLEEP     

SINCE THAT DAY.                 

OUR LITTLE STORY TOOK AN        
UNFORTUNATE TURN ABOUT A MONTH  

 AGO, WHEN YOU LET THE FURNACE  
BURN OUT AND STAY OUT, DOOMING  

THE RESIDENTS OF THIS BUILDING  
 TO A CERTAIN AND VERY PAINFUL  

DEATH.                          

THE END.                        

OKAY, I HAVE TO ASK A           
QUESTION.                       

NO.                             

NO, I HAVE TO FORMULATE A       
QUESTION...                     

...IN MY BRAIN AND THEN SAY     
IT WITH MY FACE.                

NO, NO. PLEASE.                 

THIS FEELS IMPORTANT -- TO      
CLARIFY THINGS.                 

  A MOMENT. A MOMENT. A MOMENT. 

DAVID, I NEED A DRINK.          

I NEED TO TAKE IN ALL OF THIS,  
AND THEN I PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE

A SECOND DRINK.                 

COULD WE DO THAT?               

YEAH.                           

AND THEN THE QUESTIONS.         

 I COULD -- I COULD GET ON BOARD
 WITH THAT KIND -- KIND OF      

AGENDA.                         

AND THEN THE QUESTIONS.         

THAT SOUNDS GREAT.              

I THINK --                      
UH-UH-UH-UH-UH.                 

WHAT DO WE DO NOW?              

WHAT I DO IS STAY HERE AND      
OBEY THE RULES OF THE MOLE MAN  

SURVIVAL GUIDE.                 

THERE'S NO SUCH THING.          

THERE WILL BE AS SOON AS I

WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT A

THAT'S THE SAME WORD WE --      
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER     

TERM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE     
APPLIED.                        

I DON'T WANT TO BECOME A
