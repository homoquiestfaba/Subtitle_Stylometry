¶

Wow! What a neat little town!

There's a little park
and cute little buildings!

Games and rides and--

Rotting in one
of lord hater's cells
for the rest of our lives.

Sorry, wander,
I don't think so.

Oh! Everywhere we go,
he's conquering planets,
taking over towns,

And just being a flarf-narbling,
no-fun-having jerk!

Oh! Ooh, this guy
makes me so mad!

I just wanna go up to his
bony little face and...

( grunting )

But come on, you gotta be crazy
to try and stop hater.

Right, wander?

Wander? Wander?

Wand-- whoa!

Howdy, fellas.

Folks call me "wander,"

And we really like your town.

What's your name? Whoa!

Take him to lord hater!

Hate's great, best villain!
Hate's great, best villain!

Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh!

Oh, it's on,
you little scuzz monkeys!

( screams )

Oh! Ow! Oh!

Ah. ( giggles )

Oh, there.
There, that's the spot, yeah.

Thanks, fellas.

My back's been
killing me for days!

But traveling
through the universe

Will do that to you, right?
You know what I mean.

Right? Right? Right? Right?

Hey, sylvia, right?

Right!

Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right! Left!

Sure, it's fun and all,

But sometimes you just need
to kick back and relax!

Hate's great, best villain!
Hate's great, best villain!

I mean, don't you just wish
that sometimes the constant

"hate's great, best villain!
Taste cake, it's fillin'!

Fix gate, needs drillin'!
Date kate, she's willin'!"

Would just stop?!

So you could finally
have a day off and enjoy...

The fair!

Wanna mess with me, huh?

Come on, you're not so tough!

Aah!

( groans )

You shall pay for
your foolishness!

You shall suffer the full wrath
of lord hater!

¶
( thunder crashes )

Hate's great, best villain!
Hate's great, best villain!

I have mangled
the minds of millions!

I have tempted
torrential tides of tears!

I have reduced the richest
of republics to rubble and ruin!

Because I...

Am the greatest
in all the galaxy!

¶
( thunder crashes )

Wow! Congratulations!
That's amazing!

Have you ever done this?
( makes nonsense noises )

Have you ever

The one with the hat.

Hey, I got a hat!

Wow, what a neat surprise!

Whoo!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

It's not fair!
I should've won the trophy!

I'm the greatest in the galaxy!

I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

I like your sneakers!

It's okay, sir! It's okay!

We got you, sir. We got you.

There we go.

Later, hater! Sure was fun

Who looks stupid now?

Who's not so great now?
( laughs )

( brakes screech )

( engine sputtering )

Hey!

Gotta be crazy
to try and stop hater!

Right, wander?

( roars )

( engine revving )

Please, sir! Just let them go!

The planet is ours!

Shut up, peepers!

Forget the planet,
I want that trophy!

I'm the greatest in the galaxy!

( roars )

Yahoo!

( brakes screech )

Hey, hater!

Final challenge for the win!

Last one into town

Lord hater,

I'm...

The greatest...

In all...

The galaxy!

( all cheering )

Wow, what a...

Neat...

Little...

Town!

Hi. Sorry to bother.

Just wanted to stop by
and give you this.

Congrats. You won that race
fair and square.

Well, best be goin'.

Later, hater!

( roars )

( roars )

( grunts )

That all you got,
you overgrown iguana?!

( roars )

Take that! ( laughs )

( roars )

( groaning )

Uh, syl...

You think...

That maybe...

You should...

Try another...

No!

I-I-I-I-I-I've got this!

( groans )

Totally under control.

( groans )

Yeah, but maybe there's
another way to stop--

No, this is the only way!

I'll be fine!
I need to bash this beast!

Okay.

Let's see...

Something to help,
something to help,

Something to help,
something to help,

Something to help,
something to help--

( gasps )

( roars )

Oh, you poor baby!

( groaning )

( screams )

( groans )

Oh, don't you worry!
We'll get you back to mama!

Even if she wants to kill us!

Yes, she does!
She wants to kill us dead!

Great job, wander.

This rock is perfect
for bashing that beast!

Sylvia, sylvia, sylvia...

It's like I always say,

A little lump of love will take
the buck out of the bronco.

( brakes screech )

Huh?

This rock is an egg,

And that beast
is this egg's mother.

And once it's put
back in its nest, it will hatch.

And mother and child
will have a joyful reunion!

¶ mother and child, y'all

And the power of love will
turn her into a nurturing mommy,

Instead of flying harbinger
of death and destruction!

Forget it!

Sappy, smooshy-wooshy,
lovey-dovey silliness

Ain't my style.

You're on your own
this time, wander.

That thing wants to eat us!

And the only way to get her
to back off is to fight her off!

( grunts )
ow!

I'll have
nothing to do with this!

Well, poo-poo to you,
miss punchy punchersons.

Who needs ya, anyway?
I'll do it myself!

With the power of love!

( grunting )

( groans )

Stupid egg.

What am I, a babysitter?

"let's go get the egg."

( roars )

Stop!

( brakes screech )

( grunting )

<i>Slow down.</i>

There's a baby on board!

( whistling )

( roars )

( roars )

Ugh!

Perfect! If we hurry,
we'll escape before it
realizes there's an exit!

Slower!

<i>Slower.</i>

Sl--
wander!

Look, we have got
a very short window of time

Before dragon breath
figures out a way to get to us.

If we're gonna get to that nest
in the next millennium,

This baby
is gonna have to man up--

( cheering )

And why are you doing that?!

Aw! She likes you!

( roars )

( screams )

My baby!

( screams )

Phew!

( screams )

Phew!

( screams )

Phew!

( screams )

Phew! Safe and sound!

Right back where we started!

( roars )

Quick! Out here,
we're fish in a barrel!

What is wrong with you?!

You've been flingin'
this poor thing around
like a sack of potatoes!

Do you know nothing
about proper parenting?!

( roars )

What?! What?!
What do you want me to do?!

The baby needs to know
we're helping it,

Not hurting it.

It needs some reassurance.

It needs...

Don't tell me.

A hug!

Over...

My...

Dead...

Body!

( roars )

There! Good, right?!
Good?! Can we go?!

( roars )

I'm not happy right now.

I will be back to doing

Kicking some monster butt!
