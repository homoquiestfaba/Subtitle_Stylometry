Good God.

Matthew.

Matthew.

Matthew.

They say your whole life flashes before
your eyes when you die.

And it's true, even for a blind man.

l grew up in Hell's Kitchen.

The politicians and the real-estate
developers call it Clinton now.

But a neighborhood,
like everything else, has a soul.

And souls don 't change with a name.

Come on, hit me.
l'll give you a free shot.

-Hit him again.
-You fight like your dad.

Come on, hit me.

-My dad's gonna be champ.
-Your dad's a bum.

-Yeah, a bum.
-Come on. Hit me.

-Yeah, he's a punk, man.
-Can't fight.

-Sure can run though.
-Pathetic.

My father was a boxer.

A sportswriter once wrote
that he fought like the devil...

...and the name stuck.

Jack "The Devil" Murdock
was a contender.

But that was a long time ago.

Come on, Dad. Get up.

-Who won?
-Colan.

Yeah?

-l beat him, you know.
-l know, Dad. TKO.

And l beat Sharpman,
Robbers, Wagner.

-Hey, hey, what's that?
-Nothing.

l told you l didn't want you fighting.

They said that you work for Fallon.
That you're one of his guys now.

Get over here. Sit down. Come on.

Think l'd be pulling double overtime at
the docks if l was working for Fallon?

What are you, nuts?

You don't hit nothing but books.
Get me?

You be a doctor or a lawyer.
Not like me.

-Dad. . . .
-Matt, you can do it.

You can do anything
if you're not afraid.

Now, you promise me.

l promise, Dad.

One day, l took a shortcut
home from school.

What l saw, l'll never forget...

...because it would be the last thing
l'd ever see.

-Jack, l don't want you to hurt me.
-l will.

Jack, come on.
l had other obligations.

-Dad?
-Okay, l got it.

Matt?

Matt!

l'm sorry, Matty.

l'm so sorry.

lt's okay, Dad. lt's okay.

We made each other a silent promise...

... to never give up.

To be fearless.

To stick up for the long shots like us.

We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.

l had lost my sight,
but l got something back in return.

My remaining four senses functioned
with superhuman sharpness.

But most amazing of all, my sense of
sound gave off a kind of radar sense.

High above the roar of the streets,
l trained my body and my senses.

An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...

...until the city itself
became my playground.

l was the boy without fear.

Murdock!

Hey, Murdock! Round two.

-What's up, freak?
-Look at him, man. Look at his eyes.

-Kick his ass.
-Go ahead, fight me. l dare you.

-Yeah, Murdock.
-l dare you.

Yeah, that's what l'm saying, man.
Kick his ass.

Come on, man, let's just go.

Okay.

Jack, it's been a while.

-l don't work for you no more, Fallon.
-Jack, you never stopped.

Did you really think
you won those fights on your own?

You're 42 years old.
Miller, Mack, Bendis.

They're all my fighters.

Just like you.

And now it's your turn to take a fall.

Think about your boy, Jack.

l'm sure you'll do the right thing.

No, come on, Dad! Come on, Dad,
get up! You can do it, Dad. Come on!

Come on, Dad. Get up! Come on!

Let's go! Come on! Come on, Dad!
Get up!

Never give up.

Yeah, yeah! Come on, Dad. All right!
Yeah!

You all right? Murdock, you all right?
Okay, let's fight.

Down! He's out. Fight's over.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner, by way of knockout. . .

. . .Jack "The Devil" Murdock!

This one was for you, Matty.

l waited outside of the Olympic
for my father.

ln some ways, l'm still waiting.

Finish him off.

Dad!

l can't see you, Dad.

l can't see you.

No one cared much about the death
of a washed-up prizefighter.

Nobody but me.
l would keep my promise.

l would help those
that others wouldn 't.

l would seek justice.

One way or another.

Ladies and gentlemen,
justice is blind. . .

. . .but it can be heard.
And today, the truth will come out.

Mr. Quesada,
would you state for the court. . .

. . .the sequence of events leading up
to the night of June 30?

l stopped off at Josie's Bar after work.
l had a few drinks.

Angela was there.
She was closing up.

She asked me if l wanted
to stick around for some fun.

Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.

Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?

Objection. My client's a respectable
member of the community.

-Miss Sutton has a history of drug--
-My client's not on trial.

-Her testimony is suspect--
-Nor is her testimony suspect.

Gentlemen, that's enough.

The truth is, Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton. . . .

Miss Sutton enjoyed every minute
of it.

Mr. Quesada, for your sake,
l hope justice is found here today. . .

. . .before justice finds you.

That's not right.
Another rapist back on the streets.

Yeah? Here's what l don't get.

How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsh?

He can't.
The Kingpin's gotta be footing the bill.

-Come on. Let's go get drunk.
-Not tonight.

l got work to do.

-Right here.
-Hey.

-What's up?
-You gotta take that.

-Big neck, come on.
-l can't believe--

What was her name?

To the justice system, right?
Of course l beat it.

Kingpin's got my back, bro.
How you doing, sweetie?

-Boss?
-What's up?

-What's up with that?
-ls that guy for real?

Yeah, he's for real.

-What do you want?
-Justice.

Oh, God. Oh, God!

-Hi. How you doing?
-Didn't you hear?

-l was acquitted.
-Not by me.

Hey, that light
at the end of the tunnel?

-Guess what. That's not heaven.
-l'll kill you! l'll kill you!

-That's the C train.
-l'll kill you! Oh, God!

Hey, you can't go past there.

-Call Charlie.
-Right.

You're wasting your time, Urich.
There's nothing to see here.

Jose Quesada.

And the rest of Jose Quesada.

-Whole lot of nothing, huh?
-Keep running those stories. . .

. . .and we'll end up with copycat
vigilantes who'll get themselves killed.

Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, detective?

Come on, Urich. Stop busting my--

There is no proof that your
so-called Daredevil was involved. . .

. . .nor that he even exists. Got it?

Got it.

Can one man make a difference?

There are days when l believe.
And others when l have lost all faith.

Matt, it's Heather. Are you there?
Of course you're not there.

You're never there.
At least not for me.

Look, l didn 't want to do this
over the phone...

...but it's not like you've given me
any choice.

lt's been three months now, and
l've never even seen your apartment.

Every time we sleep together,
l wake up in the morning alone.

l mean, Jesus, where do you go
at 3:00 in the morning?

l thought that if l waited, if
l was patient enough, you'd let me in.

That we'd take our relationship
to the next level.

Then l realized
that this is the next level.

Goodbye, Matt.
l hope you find what you're looking for.

Forgive me, Father, for l have sinned.

-lt's been a week since--
-What are you playing at, Matt?

You didn't come here for forgiveness.

You want permission,
and l can't give you that.

-Justice isn't a sin, Father.
-No, but vengeance is.

You see it every day on the streets.
Violence just begets more violence.

ls that how you want to live your life?
A lawyer during the day. . .

. . .and then judge and jury at night.
ls that what you want?

-Somebody has to do something.
-Well, why you?

-Because l can. Because l'm not afraid.
-Well, l'm afraid for you, Matthew.

Look, a man without fear
is a man without hope.

May God have mercy on you, forgive you
and grant you everlasting life. Amen.

l'm not too crazy
about the outfit either.

"Eyewitnesses say Quesada
was singled out. . .

. . .by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil. "

-l don't know why you read that.
-There's gotta be something to it.

-Like the alligators in the sewers?
-There are alligators in the sewers.

-A friend in sanitation has seen them.
-Fine. Just drop it.

You should see this guy.
They got this picture.

-They have a picture?
-lt's a drawing, an artist's rendering.

lt's just-- lt's grotesque.

l'd hate to see his therapy bills.
Speaking of bills. . .

. . .your client, Mr. Lee,
made his first payment.

-Great. You should be very happy.
-Yeah, it's fantastic. He paid in fluke.

Fluke is a fish.
Did you know that? l didn't.

Mr. Lee is a good man
and doesn't have much money. . .

. . .and he fishes on weekends.
l guess it's--

l salsa dance on weekends, but l don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.

Will you pass the honey, please?

We need better clients.
l'm tired of pro bono cases.

What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.

What's your idea of better?
Define "better. "

-What would be a better client?
-Better means rich and guilty, okay?

Law school taught us
to create a moral vacuum. . .

. . .so you can represent people
who aren't innocent.

-That was your best course, as l recall.
-You don't have a moral vacuum.

You are completely vacuum-less.

-What? What? Where? Where? Where?
-Front door. Not yet, soon.

Now.

Tell me.

-You want the truth?
-Absolutely.

She's hideous.

l don't know if it's a fungus
or some congenital birth defect. . .

. . .but as your attorney in this matter,
l advise you to take no further action.

-l'm sorry. Excuse me.
-Sure.

l was looking for some honey.
Could you help me out?

Right in front of you.

Well, could you be
a little bit more specific?

-What are you--?
-Blind? Yeah.

-l am so sorry.
-That's okay.

-Friend of yours?
-You know, l've never seen him before.

Matt Murdock.

-Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.
-Nice to meet you.

l didn't get your name.

l didn't give it.

Some people have no compassion
for the handicapped.

Apparently not.

-Where you going?
-l'm gonna file an appeal.

We have to be in court by noon.

-1 2:00, Matt.
-l'll be there.

What do you want?

l just wanted to get your name.
l didn't want trouble.

Look. . .

. . .l don't like being followed.
So don't.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a second. Take it easy.

l don't like being touched.

Why don't you tell me what you do like,
and we'll start there.

Sure you're blind?

Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

-You're holding back.
-Yes.

Don't.

Does every guy have to go through this
to find out your name?

Try asking for my number.

-Fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight!

Stop hitting me.

Okay.

My name's Elektra Natchios.

-What's wrong, Wesley?
-Have you seen the papers today?

Somebody's been talking.

Somebody always does.

Natchios, my dear, old friend.

l'm getting out, Wilson.

l am out.

You think it's funny?
They're writing about the Kingpin.

They're going back to the beginning.

Well, l'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

l want to put that behind me.
l want you to buy me out.

l think you'll find
it's a very generous offer.

So, what do you say?

How's your daughter?

-You okay?
-l. . . . l think l'll be okay.

l'm not gonna lie
and say it doesn't hurt.

-Where did you learn to fight like that?
-My father.

He had me study with a different sensei
every year since l was 5.

Sounds like he wanted to turn you
into some kind of a warrior.

No. Just not a victim.

-Watch your step.
-Thank you. l didn't even--

Wait.

How did you do that?
How did you do the park?

l don't know,
growing up in the Kitchen, a blind kid.

You learn how to look out for yourself.

See that? He just ran that light.

l want you to create a paper trail,
one that can be traced to Natchios.

-Sir?
-The press want a kingpin.

So l'll give them a kingpin.
Get me Bullseye.

Two out of three.

Bloody lrish piece of trash.

-l said l was sorry. What do you want?
-Details. You owe me that.

Her name's Elektra Natchios.

She sounds like a Mexican appetizer.

lt's Greek, genius.

Her father's Nikolaos Natchios.

-The billionaire?
-Yeah, see. Yes, the billionaire.

As your attorney, l advise you
to marry her immediately.

l'll take it under consideration.

Susie is my son Larry's daughter
by his first marriage.

She eloped with this
semi-colored fellow from London.

What's the word for that? Mulatto.

Just let's say he had
a little cream in his coffee.

But he did very well
for himself on the lnternet.

But don't ask me how. No.

You know, they did get me a computer
for Christmas last year. . .

. . .but l refuse. l'm afraid
it's going to explode.

But who can afford to fly these days?

But then my sister Marjorie called and
said she had these frequent-flier miles. . .

. . .and she couldn't use them
because of her sciatic nerve.

So l said--

She's sleeping. Can l get you
anything before we land?

More peanuts, please.

-Yo, taxi!
-That's over on Seventh.

-You don't remember me?
-Thanks, buddy.

How can you not remember
the Kingpin?

No, no, no, no. Please!

No, please, no!

You remember me now?

What are you, stupid? You think you
could hold out on the Kingpin? Huh?

Get away from me!

Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

This ain't your neighborhood no more.

Kitchen belongs to the Kingpin now.

Please.

Please don't hurt me.

l'm not the bad guy, kid.

l'm not the bad guy.

l'm not.

l have to call you back
because he just came in.

Morning.

-Your ears must have been burning.
-Why?

This just came by messenger.

Your invitation to the
Black & White Ball at The Grand.

Plus one.

Plus one? All right.

Guess l gotta rent a tux.

Wow. They spent some
serious money on this invitation.

l mean, you should feel it.
lt's engraved.

-What time are you gonna pick me up?
-l'm not going.

What? Are you crazy?

That place is gonna be
crawling with rich people.

People who pay legal fees
with money, not with fish.

Or with wheels of cheese.
Or with sports supplies.

l'm gonna fill you in on a secret.
This place doesn't look like a law office.

lt looks like the set of Sanford and Son.
l'm waiting for Lamont to walk in.

-Then you go.
-Look at me, Matt. l'm a plus-one.

Plus-ones don't get anywhere alone.
They need somebody to bring them.

Are you finished? We only
have an hour to prepare for court.

What's eating you?

Rough night.

Well, you want to talk about it?

No.

-lt's about Elektra, isn't it?
-No.

Natchios owns The Grand Hotel, and
Elektra's the reason you were invited.

She's out of my league,
and l'd rather end it before it starts.

That's gotta be some record. You just
completely bypass the relationship. . .

. . .you went right into the breakup.
Trying to save some time?

What happens to that lie detector
of yours when it detects your own bull?

Let's really bury the needle, huh?

Swish.

Look, Matt, seriously,
the ball's in your court.

So does this mean you want a rematch?

l knew l'd find you.

How did you know l wasn't a mugger?

Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels.

At least this far from Chelsea.

Come here.

There's something l wanna show you.

Wait a second.

Exactly how many women
have you brought up here, anyway?

You're my first.

-Good answer.
-l thought that was the right answer.

Look at this.

lt's so beautiful.

l know. This was my favorite view
of the city when l was a kid.

l really wanted you to see this.

What's this?

That's from my mother.

-For good luck.
-lt's beautiful.

lt's a good-luck charm, huh?

l could use one of those.
Do they make them in Braille?

She gave it to me right before she died.

What happened?

-l should go.
-No. Just wait.

-No, l'm gonna go--
-Wait, wait, wait. lt's about to rain.

-No, it's not.
-lt is. l'm telling you, it's--

The temperature dropped two or
three degrees. l can smell the moisture.

And when it rains, it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

Each raindrop makes a sound
the first time it falls on a surface.

Just then, it's like l. . . .

lt's like l can see again.

And l just wanna. . . .

l just wanna see you.

Okay.

Look, here it comes.

My God.

You are so beautiful.

Hey, l'm gonna cut you up, man.

-Think Kingpin didn't want his money?
-What?

-That's my car! That's my car!
-Matt, what's wrong?

-Police!
-Shut up!

-Matt?
-l'm sorry.

-l have to go.
-Hey, come back here.

Stay.

Stay with me.

This is what l'm talking about.
Aren't you happy you listened to me?

This is gonna be great for business.

Thank you.

Matt Murdock. Ben Urich,
New York Post.

Ben Urich, nice to meet you.

You write articles
about urban legends, right?

Well, yes, among other things.

Settle something for us. You know
the alligators in the sewers? My partner--

l followed that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

One man running all the crime in New
York City sounds a little far-fetched.

Yeah, but, then again, so does a vigilante
who thinks every day is Halloween.

They gotta be huge by now, right,
the alligators?

lt's a myth.

Look, l'd like you to give me a call--

Sorry.

Cool color.

l wouldn't know.

Yeah, but do give me a call. There's
something l'd like to talk to you about.

Nice to meet you. Enjoy the party.

Look at that.
Wilson Fisk is in the hizzey.

We may never get a chance
like this again. Come on, let's go.

-We should talk about this.
-Mr. Fisk. Hi.

lt's Franklin Nelson
from Nelson & Murdock--

Hey, yeah, you wanna talk to Mr. Fisk,
you make an appointment.

-Okay?
-Wesley. l know who you are.

You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

Right. Actually, he's the blind one.

l'm deaf.

Give them a card, Wesley.

l'm always on the lookout
for new blood.

l'm sorry, Mr. Fisk.
My partner is a little overzealous.

We can't represent you.

And why is that?

Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

"lnnocent," he said. He's pretty funny.

l've learned one thing
in my years in this business.

What's that?

Nobody's innocent.

Nobody.

-Have a great time at the party.
-Thank you.

l just-- You know, Matt,
for one night, l just wish. . . .

l just. . . .

Matt, l just wish l could
give you my eyes for one night.

-lt's like that?
-lt's like that.

You want me to take you
up there, Matt? Matt?

Matt?

Now l found you.

That's all that matters.

Hi. Hello. Hello.

Hello.

You look beautiful tonight.

Do you mind?

No, l just. . . . Sometimes it makes
people uncomfortable. That's all.

Not me.

But you should know. . .

. . .that the only reason
l got dressed up for this thing. . .

. . .was that l wanted
to look beautiful for you.

l wish you could see me tonight.

Me too.

Matt.

What's wrong?

lt's just. . .

. . .good things don't happen
to me very often.

When they do, l get scared.

Nothing bad is gonna happen. Promise.

Doesn't she look beautiful?

l think she's happy.

l haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

Poor girl. Right in front of her eyes.

What, you have to bring that up now?

History has a way of repeating itself.

-What are you saying?
-Just saying goodbye, old friend.

Just saying goodbye.

-Something's happening.
-What is it?

Papa!

Papa. Papa.

Tell me where you're going.

You wait.

l'm sorry.

-What is going on?
-New York is not a safe place tonight.

That's all you need to know.

Watch out!

l missed. l never miss.

Drop something?

Bullseye.

Daddy.

Get that over to Forensics right away.

Hey, Nick.

What do you want, Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

Looks like you got your story.

You were right, Father.

You were right.

-l know how you feel.
-You don't know how l feel.

l want revenge.

Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. l know.

There's no place for me now.

Yes, there is.

Stay.

Stay with me.

Please.

Elektra.

Elektra, wait.

Please.

Drive.

Oh, cha-ching.

This better be good, Kirby.

You know me, Urich.
lt's always good. Come on.

Okay.

Are you ready to see
something really, really cool?

-Come on.
-Okay.

-Come on. l'm throwing you gold.
-Give me my money.

-Why?
-l've seen it. Come on.

All right.
Well, but have you seen this?

And tighty righty, loosey left--

You said to look out
for anything weird, yes?

This is pretty weird shit
right here, man. Right?

You have no idea.

Police are still investigating the murder
of Nikolaos Natchios--

--will identify Natchios
as the so-called Kingpin.

--believes that the self-styled
vigilante is wanted for murder.

--implication of Daredevil.

How did you get past my security?

You mean that guy?

Was that really necessary?

Necessary? No, it was fun.

You know, you've exceeded
all my expectations.

You even managed to implicate Daredevil
in the process. You should be pleased.

He. . .

. . .made me. . .

. . .miss.

There's an old saying that
too much pride can kill a man.

The devil is mine.

Really?

l've heard that before, all too
many times. But answer me this:

How do you kill a man without fear?

By putting the fear in him.

l like that. But first. . .

. . .give Elektra all my best.

ls there anything else?

Yeah.

l want a bloody costume.

What do you want?

-Matt, it's Ben Urich.
-l know who it is. What do you want?

l got a lead on my story.

l think Natchios was set up
by the real Kingpin.

Why are you telling me this?

They say the Kingpin
doesn't just kill you.

He kills your whole family.

l think your girl's in trouble.

l thought you might know
somebody that could protect her.

Remember me?

Wait!

lt wasn't me.

Stop!
lt was a hit man named Bullseye.

-l didn't kill your father.
-Liar.

l want to look into the eyes
of my father's killer as he dies.

Wait. Wait.

Now you know.

Oh, God.

l was just trying to protect you, Elektra.

-l'm sorry.
-Elektra.

That's him. That's Bullseye.

Listen to me. You have to run.

-He has to pay for what he's done.
-No, you don't understand.

l don't want to lose you again.

l'll find you.

Come on, girl.

Hey, orphan. Let's play.

Nice. Come on.

You're good, baby. l'll give you that.

But me. . .

. . .l'm magic.

And now for my next trick.

No! No!

N. Y.P.D. Aviation.
Please do not move.

Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

l repeat, get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

Help me.

Stay. Just stay with me.

Everything's clear.

Matthew. Matthew.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

l tried, Father.

l tried.

-This is who l am.
-ls that a fact?

First one's a warning. . .

. . .Padre.

-ls there a back door out of here?
-Yeah.

-Take it. Call the police.
-What about you?

-l have to finish this.
-You can't fight like this.

Have faith, Father. lsn't that right?

You.

Let's play.

Kane, l want the blueprints and
the city grids. Secure the perimeter.

-Yes, sir.
-Where the hell's my SWAT team?

Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go.

-Hey, Coyle. Keep them in your sights.
-Which one?

Both of them.
l want a man on that roof.

Ready?

The man without fear. Looks like
l found something you're afraid of.

Let's bring on the pain.

Let's bring on the noise.

Fisk was right about you.
He said you wouldn't go easy.

Fisk? Fisk is the Kingpin?

Yeah.

The whole red rose thing,
he loves that shit. lt's not my style.

He hired me to kill Natchios.
And to gut your pretty girlfriend too.

But me, l'm going for the hat trick.

l told him l'd do you for free.

The devil is mine.

Oh, my hands! My hands.

You took away my hands.

Show mercy.

Bull's-eye.

-Freeze!
-Don't move!

Detective, look!

Good luck, son.

There's been a problem.

Bullseye failed.

Correct.

Send the guards home.

-But, sir--
-l was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.

This is something
you wouldn't understand.

Daredevil.

Kingpin.

lt's a shame you came here wounded.

l would have loved to fight you
in your prime.

They call you the man without fear.

lf that's true, why are you afraid
to show your face?

l don't believe it.

No. No.

The blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen?

You killed the only two people
l ever loved.

Why?

Business.

That's all it ever is, business.

l was working for Fallon at the time.

Your father was supposed
to throw a fight. . .

. . .and your girl was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.

lt's always business.

l'll find you.

You've been in my business
for too long.

l've been thinking about this day
since l was 1 2 years old.

l don't understand.

l'm not the bad guy.

You hear that, blind man?

The sirens.

They're coming for you.

For me?

Didn't you hear?

The word's out on the Kingpin.

They're coming for you.

l can hear the police radios from here.

No, no.

l swear l'll tell them who you are.

Yeah? Go ahead, tell them.

Tell the guys at Riker's all about
how you got beat by a blind man.

lt'll be like blood in the water.

Don't worry about that,
because l'll get out.

Yeah, l know.

And l'll be waiting.

Justice is served.

l'll get you.

l'll get you.

lt's not over with yet.

Not over with Daredevil.

This is for you, Dad.

"Though there were no witnesses, police
think Daredevil brought Fisk to justice. "

There were no eyewitnesses.

lt's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

lf there's no eyewitnesses--
Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

-Please.
-The alligators in the sewers--

So there are alligators
in the sewers?

l didn't admit that. l'm explaining--

Do you concede that there are
alligators in the sewers?

-Do l concede that? No.
-Answer the question.

How can you not concede? You--

Judy, we're over here.

How you doing?

l'm doing okay. l'll be all right.

You wanna talk about it?

No, but thanks.

-l'm gonna get some air.
-l got this.

Thanks.

l had set out to save the city...

...but with Elektra 's help,
l saved myself instead.

Now l have faith
that anything is possible.

Braille.

And some days, faith is all you need.

As for Daredevil, well....

Soon the world will know the truth:

That this is a city born of heroes.

That one man can make a difference.

Go get them, Matt.

Hell's Kitchen is my neighborhood.

l prowl the rooftops and alleyways
at night...

... watching from the darkness.

Forever in darkness...

...a guardian devil.

Bull's-eye.
