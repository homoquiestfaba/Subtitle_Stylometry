You must sense it...

through your body,
through your feelings...

when your living experience...

level after level...

right into the heart of it.

Any chance of getting a lesson, sir?

Ohhh, but...

you may not know...

but this is a solemn and serious matter.

Just call me Shivas.

Go ahead, they'll understand.

Stick your bum out.

Keep this straight...

My name's Michael Murphy. I hope I'm not
intruding, but Shivas invited me to dinner-

Well, now Mr. Murphy,

you wouldn't have done that if
you didn't have a good reason.

Don't worry, the Badman often
brings his play partners her to our place.

Peter, my wife Agatha...

welcome to our good camp Blaithe.

What have you done with
our unpredictable friend?

Me? I, uh...

Ahh, don't tell me...he's out there waiting for the
moon to rise or communing with his higher self.

This is Dr. Julian Lange.

Ahh...Mr. Murphy.

so, I hear the man brought you
through the eye of the needle?

-Excuse me?
-Oh, he's just messing with you.

These are the Greens...

they've come from Cornwall to study
the ecology here at Burningbush.

Adam, here teaches cosmic ecology
at London's free university.

And Eve teaches creative
environmental writing.

They've got this wonderful new theory
of <i>evolution</i> and golfing links.

I do want to hear what you
and Shamus talk about...

I really do. I mean this
is why I'm going to India.

I'm going to learn about this stuff.

I hope to be a writer someday, actually.

But right now I'm finishing
my studies in philosophy.

I'll do it.

This is the most famous
golf course in the world.

This is where it all began...

I've come all the way from California.
I'm only here for the day.

I've played Pebble my whole life, but I've
always dreamed of playing Burningbush.

Put me with the best player on that list.

I can match up with anyone...

if not better.


The starter told me to join you two.

Shivas Irons.

Michael Murphy.

Balie McIver.

Let's try a few shots for
the set up swing...

and a few shots for
through gravity...

and then a few to score.

Good shot.

How did you know to hit it there?

That's the best line to the green.

Just luck.

(Shivas Singing)




that's what golf is.

together yet still maintain a proper distance.

But don't get me wrong,
you're not like us women...

or Italians all hugging
embracing each other.

You need to feel your separate love.

Just look...

You won't come home on time when you're with the boys.
I've learned that over the years.

The love you feel for your
friends is too strong for that.

And all those gentlemanly rules...

why they're the proper rules of affection.

All the waiting and the "oohing
and aahing" over your shots...

and this one's drive and that one's
putt and the other one's gorgeous swing...

what is all that, but love?

Men loving men...that's what golf is.

I like your swing, Michael.

Your not a professional, now are you...trying
to sneak up on us for a wee bit, eh?

Uh, just an amateur passing through.

Where are you headed?

India...to a place you've probably
never heard of called Pondicherry.

Sri Aurobindo, perhaps?


No one does back home.

             Nor do they here.

Let's tee it up..

Any chance of getting a lesson, sir?

Oh, but...

you may not know...

but this is a solemn and serious matter.

And just call me Shivas.

Alright...2 or 3 birdies on the par fives...

maybe 1 or 2 more...

that should give me a shot at a 72.

If not better.

Just hold on now there, Michael.

Wait your turn.

I propose that we all take a turn
describing the game of golf.

Each one telling...

exactly what this endlessly
mysterious game is really about.

It's time we done justice to the subject,
and this is just the crowd to do it.

Now...

Michael, you will remember it all...

for posterity.

Peter, your the host...begin.

No, Agatha is.
This is her party.

Well, then Agatha...begin.

Nope, Peter's the one with the ideas.

Well, then, Peter...

You'll not be gettin' any fancy theories from me.

And I'll keep my speech short.

I'm saying my farewell to the game...
I've suffered enough with it.

I'd like to propose a toast...

To Peter's imminent departure...

and his predictable return.

Predictable return.

-Bring everybody luck.
-Okay...

We do this, you see...

every time I give up the game.


What was your score, laddie?

Don't bother...I'll keep my own score.
You have your lesson.

I insist.

Um...

a 4 on the 1st...

and a 6 on the 2nd
with that damned bunker.


You must count that one
that you knocked off the tee.

When you had your waggle.

So, a 5 and a 6, then?


you have to remember...

you're in the land where
all these rules were invented.

'Tis the only way you can play in the Kingdom.

You must count that one
that you knocked off the tee.

When you took your waggle.

Can I hit another?
I think that one might be lost.





Should I play it or drop out?




always play it as it lies.


I should drop out.

when you come out, yeah?

it'll come out eventually.


6 on the 2nd.

That damned bunker.

You must count that one that you knocked
off the tee when you took your waggle.

when you took your waggle.

You're makin' a great mistake...

if you think the game...

is meant for the shot.

The game is meant for <i>walking</i>.

Old man Key, there...

he showed us how.

With him...

you get the spirit in yourself
to learn to enjoy every step.

I played with him once.
He was 90 years old...

and I'll never forget it.

He sometimes forgot his shots...

the walkin' got to be so good.

That's impossible.

He said he learned to walk
like that from an Indian Yogi...

in the 1880's.

He went on a walk with the Yogi...

in the Himalayas.

And he never got over it.

He said "A walk like that...

was as good for your
soul as a day in church."

And that was somethin' comin' from him
because he was a good Presbyterian.

Noticed you didn't pay much
attention to the walkin'.

I pay attention...

to my next shot.


not enough people do.

It's a shame.

A rotten shame.

Because if you can enjoy the walk...

then perhaps you can enjoy
the other times in your life...

when you're in between.

And that's most of the time.

Couldn't you say?

Michael, just try using your
short irons to finish the hole.

all agree it's a mysterious game.

An X-ray on the soul.

all those years ago.


by choosing to do his special work <i>here</i>, Peter.

Don't be bringing Shamus McDuff
into this...I can't stand the man.

is our great good friend.



depending on your point of view.


Why the city ever consented to let him live in
that ravine off the 13th green, I'll never know.


good deal of his precious time there.

He's constantly studying the
game, working on his theories.


something he now calls <i>true gravity</i>.

alignment of human consciousness...

with the physical forces of the universe.


I mean, basically he's had to tip the balance of his mind.

in order to study gravity.

You see, he's floating free now so that
he can get a better <i>fix</i> upon this world of ours.



Come, let us call upon him in the midnight hour.

Shivas!!




That's just how it felt.

Except when they're not.

[SHIVAS YELLING]





What's that sound?


it means the coming of the Northern Lights.

here, that believing in God is dangerous.

Well, we all know he's the dangerous one.

Oh yeah, he's the dangerous one.


I mean, I just met him.


we'll wait a while and see if he comes.



I remember seeing him as a boy.

From time to time reigning
a Shetland pony around the lot.



I mean, should we go look?


we'd disturb him something awful.


he's not here I tell
ya, he's not here.


most figured he'd gone mad.

And then one day I was home on leave...

for no apparent reason I was
drawn to the old burial ground next to the cathedral.

And there he was, standing in front
of the tomb of Old Tom Morris.

Said he was expecting me...

said he<i> knew</i> that I'd be there.

This was just 2 weeks after the
bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

"The beginning of the end," he said.

"The final sign Man must discover his soul..."

"...or go the way of the dying species..."

"...down into the darkest night without end..."

"...evolution has taken an awful turn..."

"...and we've not much time
to right the balance."

"You and I have much to do." he said...

"...for these are our final days."

"We <i>must</i> make golf a
matter of life and death."

Of course, our collaboration
began immediately.


places he goes on occasion.

He loves to work at night...

says he can<i> feel </i> better...

the things he's studying.



So they say...


I'm not counting that hole.






don't worry so much about your score.

It's not the important thing.



While they watch me like<i> hawks</i>.


Hit the shot. Hit the<i> damn</i> shot.


[SHIVAS AND BILLY] Come on, Michael, you can do it.


And other days I hate them.

And it's always different, depending on my mood.




like marriage, golf is.

complex, and fragile as the world itself.

And very like the game of golf.


both demand a steadfast
purpose and imagination.

Persistent will, and a willingness to change.

Long shorts and a gentle stroke.

A deft touch and the occasional gamble.

Steady nerves and a certain wild streak.

And it all has to come together
or the whole thing goes kaflooey.


Put me with the<i> best</i>  player.

I can match up with <i>anyone</i>.

If not better.

and let the nothingness into your shot?

Jimmy Tumner, how are you?



You mind if we do a bit of practice here, Jimmy?

Take out your driver, there.

That's it...

feet apart, there, that's good.

Just stand on the one leg...

that's it. One leg.
Now get the leg up, up at the back.

Put the arms forward...

that's it.

No, keep that up, up, up
that's it, that's good.


You take it awful serious,
now have a wee breath.

Close your eyes, close your eyes.

He is , in fact, the<i> only

that's because this world of ours has gotten off its axis

He's just re-adjusting his sights...

I mean, can any of us here
say we're doing any better?

Shamus...

taught me everything I know about the game.

He is my truest teacher.

like to see his weapon?


he calls this his baffid spoon.

It's a name he remembers from his childhood.

Shamus says "You only need one stick to play
the game." But this is no ordinary stick.

And this...

is his feathery.

He found it in the ravine...

this is the real McCoy.

Made from feathers and leather.

And soaked in brine.

Now you see...

you see that target?

That target there?

Watch this...

Sometimes you think the ball
will just never come down.

You ever had that feelin'?


Look, there he is.

That's the best line to the green.


Where are you pointin' I don't see him at all.



'Tis a microcosm of the world...

a projection of all of our hopes and fears.

Take our love of the balls flight...

the sight of it hanging there in space...

anticipates our desire for transcendence.

The thrill of seeing it fly over the land, over
obstacles, especially over a stretch of water...

and then onto the green...

and into the hole.

Ahh...that's a mystical quality...

There is something in us,
something in all of us...

that loves that flight.





but it must have been a trick
of the retina, with the sun--

when you swing...

I want you to put all your attention...

Your inner body.

Feel your inner body.

That's it...

Close your eyes, Michael.

Close your eyes.

<i>Remember</i>  that feelin', Michael.

Well, golf is becoming an even better
vehicle for training the higher capacities.

All signals that it is becoming
the yoga of the super-mind.

It's the ultimate discipline for transcendence.

along with signals of <i>transcendence</i>.

Look, you can see any damned
signals you want in the game.

Now, see how spellbound we are
with the warden around us.

Hypnotized from morning till night by the...

influence human or otherwise,
that impinges on our senses.

Every theory you propose about the
evolution of the game I will show you...

How the game is fading
away, losing its charm.

Being mechanized by the Americans and the
rest of the world that blindly follow them.

Look at the crowded links...

the lack of leisure...

hurried starting times...come on.

I've seen twisted lives twist our
bodies into making distorted swings.

And how the electric carts, how
they've <i>ruined</i>  our courses...

and robbed us of our exercise.

How the desire for greener
greens has polluted the land.

Now where is the <i>evolution</i> in all that?

We're all hypnotized, I tell you.

You're just refusing to see the fact.

We all sit here just
getting high on whiskey.

Painting glorious pictures on the meaning of golf...

The world outside grows ever darker.

It came too easily.

Isn't all this talk of inner bodies and subtle
energies just a device for helping concentration?

As long as I feel it. It's the experience

I mean, look, Shamus is obviously an
incredible person whether he's mad or not.


It's your world that's mad.

Young man.

Let's go. I can see this has been a mistake.


Please, Shivas. Let's
wait for Shamus.

You look like you're gonna ask me to marry you.

what you and Shamus talk about.

I really do.


I mean, this is why I'm going to India to learn about this stuff.

Pythagoras had the clue.

To know the world from the
inside, not the outside, as we do.

Like I showed you in the golf shots, there.

True gravity...

that's Shamus' term for the
deeper lanes of forces...

for the deeper structure of the universe.

But this is it.

You have to live into it, yourself.

You can't poke it and shove it the way they
do in the universities and your laboratories...

You must get right into the heart of it...

You must sense it...

through your body, through your feelings...

through your living experience, level after level...

right into the heart of it.

And that's why you won't see me giving any
tips to your golf swings, and these...

how-to books. I won't do it.

Because you have to start from inside yourself.

Like I showed you..


Go on, from your inner body, Michael.


Let all your power come from your center.

That's it.

Good.

I've often wondered what it would
be like to play the course...

I've often been tempted...

Why don't we did it?







SHIVAS] What do you think?



What do you think?!

[SHIVAS BELLOWING]

It'll do you the world of good.

Come on.

Come on, try just once.

Just once.

Just one.

I did it!

The old baffin spoon did it!

Yeah!

Come on, come on, come on.

Do you think I'm like a regular

And the best place for me...
