>> LARA, THE AGENT SHOWED ME

PICTURES OF THE LAKE VIEW --

AH, THEY LOOKED AMAZING.

I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A GREAT

APARTMENT.

There's even a convenience store

on the ground floor.

And he said the station is five

minutes away, walking distance.

>> [ HUMMING ]

>> I CAN GET TO MY OFFICE IN

LESS THAN 20 MINUTES.

YEAH!

>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

JANET, SLOW DOWN.

HOW MANY DID YOU SEE?

>> I SIGNED THE LEASE.

>> I SAID LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT,

NOT SIGN THE LEASE ON THE FIRST

ONE THEY SHOWED YOU.

WELL, HOW MUCH IS IT?

>> IT'S ONLY $750 A MONTH.

THE GUY SAID IT WAS GONNA BE

GONE WITHIN THE HOUR.

>> YOU NEVER SIGN THE LEASE ON

THE FIRST ONE THEY SHOW YOU.

>> [ Sighing ] OH, GOD.

YOU ARE STRESSING ME OUT.

It really looked beautiful in

the brochure.

>> IS IT IN A SAFE PLACE AT

LEAST?

>> Come on, Lara.

>> LARA.

>> It's sure better there than

at home.

>> LET ME TALK TO JANET.

>> IT'S MOM. I GOT TO GO.

>> IT'S DONE ALREADY, OKAY?

IT'S DONE.

BYE. [ SIGHS ]

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

>> I WANT TO TALK TO HER!

WHAT IS GOING ON?

IS SHE MOVING OUT?

AND WHY AM I THE LAST TO FIND

OUT ABOUT THIS?

>> [ SIGHS ] WHY?

BECAUSE YOU NEARLY KILLED HER.

>> OH, MY GOD. SHE SAID THAT?

HA. WHAT A DRAMA QUEEN.

[ SCOFFS ]

I WAS STANDING, PLAYING MY

GUITAR, AND I TURNED.

I DIDN'T HEAR HER WALK IN, AND I

HIT HER.

>> BLAME THE GUITAR. WHY NOT?

>> OH, YOU REALLY THINK THAT I

WOULD, ON PURPOSE, TRY TO HIT

JANET?

>> MOM, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW YOU

WERE DRUNK.

>> OH, YEAH.

AND WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

MY BEST SONGS WERE WRITTEN DRUNK

ANYWAY.

LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE IN

CAHOOTS WITH HER ON THIS

WHOLE WHATEVER THIS IS.

I WANT YOU TO JUST...

GET HER OUT OF THAT -- WHATEVER

IT IS -- AND BRING HER BACK

HERE.

'CAUSE THAT IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

>> SHE'S 24 YEARS OLD.

SHE'S GOT A LIFE.

SHE HAS A JOB.

SHE -- SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY FOR

HER?

>> OH, BE HAPPY FOR HER AND HER

DEAD-END JOB, WHEN SHE HAS A

REAL VOICE AND COULD HAVE A

CAREER JUST LIKE I HAVE.

>> YEAH, WELL, CLEARLY SHE

DOESN'T WANT TO FOLLOW IN YOUR

FOOTSTEPS.

>> 'CAUSE IT'S SO TERRIBLE TO

HAVE SUCCESS AT SOMETHING YOU

LOVE DOING THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT?

>> SUCCESS. [ SIGHS ] RIGHT.

WELL, DRUGS, DRINKING, REHAB,

FAILED MARRIAGES -- WORTH IT FOR

YOU, MAYBE, NOT SO MUCH FOR US.

>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE,

SUMMING UP MY LIFE LIKE THAT.

I HAD A NUMBER-ONE HIT...

WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THAN YOU ARE

NOW.

AND WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE,

HMM, EITHER ONE OF YOU?

TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOUR BIG

ACHIEVEMENTS?

HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT.

YOU TWO HAD IT GOOD.

>> YEAH. GREAT.

>> AND I AM NOT PAYING FOR ANY

APARTMENT!

>> HMM.

>> MOM, STOP IT.

>> SHE LEAVES WITHOUT EVEN

SAYING GOODBYE.

>> IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

>> A FORCE?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

>> I DON'T KNOW.

I GOT THROWN AGAINST THE WALL.

>> FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, LET

ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY ON

THIS PLACE.

IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, FOUR

PEOPLE, INCLUDING YOUR SISTER,

HAVE DIED HERE -- ALL WOMEN IN

THEIR 20s.

MAY 15th OF LAST YEAR,

SHAWN WILLIAMS, AGE 27, JUMPED

OR FELL FROM THE BALCONY FOUR

DAYS AFTER MOVING IN.

TWO YEARS AGO, NOVEMBER 30th,

DANA BAUER, AGE 28, FELL OR

JUMPED FROM THE BALCONY AFTER

THREE DAYS OF BEING THERE.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

YOUR SISTER, BUT IT WAS THE SAME

THING.

TWO DAYS AFTER MOVING IN, SHE

DIED FALLING FROM THE BALCONY.

NOW, AS FAR AS WE CAN FIGURE

OUT, THESE WOMEN NEVER MET.

THEY DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON,

EXCEPT FOR THIS APARTMENT.

AND APARTMENTS DON'T KILL

PEOPLE.

PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.

>> WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL US

THIS AFTER JANET DIED?

>> I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD HAVE DONE

THAT.

THERE ARE NO MORE ACTIVE CASES

GOING ON WITH ANY OF THESE

SUICIDES.

>> MY SISTER WOULDN'T COMMIT

SUICIDE.

[ RUMBLING SOUND ]

>> MS. SLATE, ARE YOU TAKING

DRUGS?

>> WHAT?

>> ANY KIND OF DRUGS?

>> NO. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

DIDN'T YOU SAY THERE WAS A

FOURTH PERSON?

>> YES. SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE.

AND IT WAS A CLEAR CASE OF

HOMICIDE-SUICIDE.

THERE WE GO -- MARY LOGAN,

RESPECTED SCHOOLTEACHER, BECAUSE

OF SOME PARENT-TEACHER DISPUTE,

LOST HER JOB AND SOON THEREAFTER

LOST HER HOUSE IN A BITTER

DIVORCE.

SO MARY MOVED HERE WITH HER

DAUGHTER, JENNIFER, WHO WAS THEN

12 YEARS OLD.

MARY BECAME A DRUNK AND A

PROSTITUTE, AND JENNIFER MUST

HAVE SUFFERED UNTOLD ABUSE FOR

YEARS.

AND THEN ON SEPTEMBER 17th,

ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO...

[ SCRATCHING SOUND ]

...NEIGHBORS REPORTED A FOUL,

AWFUL SMELL COMING FROM THIS

APARTMENT.

AND WHEN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

CAME TO INVESTIGATE, JENNIFER

JUMPED OFF THE BALCONY TO HER

DEATH.

THE POLICE FOUND THE DECOMPOSED

BODY OF HER MOTHER HIDDEN IN A

BUILT-IN CLOSET.

NOW, ARE ANY OF THESE NAMES

FAMILIAR TO YOU?

>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

DO YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE LET MY

SISTER MOVE IN HERE IF I KNEW

ANY OF THIS?

>> NO, I GUESS NOT.

I'LL REPORT YOUR CALL AS A HOME

INVASION, BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE

ANYONE.

YOU'RE LOOKING BETTER NOW.

I SHOULD GET BACK TO THE STATION

AND END MY SHIFT.

THOUGH I'D BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU A

RIDE HOME.

>> OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

[ CHUCKLES ]

LAST THING I NEED IS TO BE

COMING HOME IN A COP CAR AT 5:00

A.M.

I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER.

>> TAKE CARE, MS. SLATE.

[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

[ MUSIC PLAYING FROM

HEADPHONES ]

>> I THOUGHT I MIGHT FIND YOU

HERE.

>> HEY.

LOOK, I'M SORRY.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO ACCUSE YOU

OF...

THE POLICE KEEP SAYING IT WAS A

SUICIDE, AND I JUST -- I CAN'T

WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT.

MY MOM DROVE US NUTS, BUT NOT TO

THAT EXTENT.

>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS A

SUICIDE, EITHER.

>> YOU DON'T?

>> THAT NIGHT, WHEN I WAS

LEAVING THE BUILDING, I HEARD A

SCREAM, AND I SWEAR I SAW

SOMEONE WRESTLING WITH JANET ON

THE BALCONY.

I COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG.

I MEAN, IT WAS JUST FOR A

SECOND, AND IT WAS DARK.

>> DID YOU TELL THE POLICE?

>> YEAH, OF COURSE I DID.

THEY TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

AND I JUST DID.

>> WHY DID YOU LEAVE HER IN THE

MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

>> I'D RATHER WAKE UP IN MY OWN

BED.

>> THAT'S WHAT MEN SAY WHEN

THEY'RE MARRIED.

ARE YOU?

>> SEPARATED.

I HAVE A BOY.

>> DID YOU CARE FOR HER AT ALL?

>> YEAH, I DID.

LOOK, OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS NEW.

WE WERE JUST GETTING TO KNOW

EACH OTHER, BUT I CARED ABOUT

HER.

JANET WAS CONVINCED THAT SOMEONE

HAD ACCESS TO THAT APARTMENT.

SHE TOLD ME SHE HEARD THINGS.

SHE SAW SOMEONE IN THERE, SO I

TOOK A LOOK AROUND, AND THERE

WAS NOTHING -- NOBODY, AND

THERE'S NO WAY TO GET INTO THAT

APARTMENT UNLESS YOU GO IN

THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

>> YEAH, WELL, I'M THINKING OF

KEEPING THE PLACE.

>> THAT'S BRAVE.

THERE WAS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT

THAT APARTMENT.

IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO

BE THERE ALONE.

>> LOOK, I GOT TO GO.

WHY DON'T YOU COME BY TONIGHT?

WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT THEN.

>> TAKE OFF.

>> DID JANET SLATE KNOW YOU WERE

A COP?

>> NO.

>> DID ANYONE KNOW YOU WERE

GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT AT

APARTMENT 1303?

>> NO.

WHAT'S WITH THE QUESTIONS?

AM I UNDER INVESTIGATION NOW?

>> WELL, THAT JUDGE ON THE FIFTH

CIRCUIT DID GIVE US ACCESS TO

YOUR CELLPHONE.

ONE OF YOUR TEXT MESSAGES THE

NIGHT MS. SLATE DIED WAS, AND I

QUOTE, "WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?"

THAT WAS YOUR WIFE, RIGHT?

>> [ SIGHS ] JESUS CHRIST.

>> IS IT POSSIBLE SHE FOLLOWED

YOU AND CONFRONTED MS. SLATE

AFTER YOU LEFT?

>> NO, SHE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT

WHAT I DO AS LONG AS I GET MONEY

FOR MY SON EVERY MONTH, ALL

RIGHT?

ARE WE DONE HERE?

>> WHY'D YOU GO SEE LARA SLATE?

>> WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

>> SHE'S A PERSON OF INTEREST.

>> AND WHY IS THAT?

>> WHY IS THAT?

YOU SAID YOU SAW TWO WOMEN ON

THE BALCONY, RIGHT?

IT'S IN YOUR REPORT.

>> YOU'RE GONNA MOVE IN TO WHERE

YOUR SISTER DIED?

ARE YOU SICK?

>> I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

I'M MOVING OUT.

>> HA! ALL RIGHT.

WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

YOU'VE MISMANAGED YOUR LIFE SO

FAR.

I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT

HAPPENS NEXT.

>> I WON'T COME BACK TONIGHT.

>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, LARA?

YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR THAT

COLLEGE -- WHATEVER THE FUCK IT

IS?

I'LL PAY FOR IT, ALL RIGHT?

YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE TILL TERM

STARTS, ALL RIGHT?

>> IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MOM.

>> I CANNOT BE ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY...IN

BETWEEN BOYFRIENDS, BESIDES

WHICH, YOU KNOW, WHO'S GONNA

DRIVE ME?

WANT ME TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON

DRIVERS?

>> YOU PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU GOT A

D.U.I.

>> I LOVE YOU.

YOU'RE MY BABY.

AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

YOU LEAVE NOW!

DON'T YOU EVER FUCKING COME

BACK...EVER!

>> YOU THINK YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH?

>> IT'S COLD IN HERE.

I KEEP TRYING TO CLOSE THOSE

DOORS, AND THEY DON'T SHUT.

YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE GIRL FROM

NEXT DOOR...SHE TOLD ME THAT A

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER LIVED IN

HERE, AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THIS

PLACE RENTED.

SHE SAID SHE TOLD JANET TO

LEAVE.

>> DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

>> YEAH, I KNOW.

IN 1993, A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

LIVED IN HERE.

THE DAUGHTER WENT CRAZY AND

KILLED THE MOTHER, PUT HER IN

THE CLOSET, LIVED WITH THE BODY

FOR SIX MONTHS, AND THEN SHE

FINALLY JUMPED OFF THE BALCONY.

[ CLACKING SOUND ]

WHY DO YOU HAVE A GUN?

EXPLAIN THE GUN.

>> I'M AN UNDERCOVER COP, OKAY?

>> WHAT THE FUCK?!

WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

>> NOTHING IS GOING ON.

>> MY SISTER DIED IN THIS

APARTMENT!

>> DON'T FIGHT ME!

LOOK, SIT DOWN. RELAX. OKAY?

JANET DIDN'T KNOW I WAS AN

UNDERCOVER COP, AND I HAD

NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED

HERE.

BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

HAPPENED JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

YOU OKAY?

>> NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

>> YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

>> NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE

NOW.

YOU OWE ME.

YOU CAN SPEND THE NIGHT ON THE

COUCH AND GUARD ME.

I'LL BE THERE THIS AFTERNOON TO

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

FUCK.

HEY.

I GOT TO GO.

ARE YOU STAYING, OR CAN I TAKE

YOU SOMEWHERE?

>> I'M OKAY.

I'LL STAY HERE.

>> ALL RIGHT.

I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

ENTER A TENANT'S APARTMENT WHILE

THEY'RE IN IT?

>> YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT

A LEASE.

>> MY SISTER JANET ALREADY

SIGNED A LEASE AND PAID FIRST

MONTH'S RENT.

FINE.

I'LL PAY FOR A NEW LEASE, BUT I

NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

>> I'M HERE NOW.

[ DOOR OPENS ]

[ HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS ]

>> HI, LARA.

I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU.

YOUR MOTHER FILED A TEMPORARY

RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST YOU,

AND HER SWORN STATEMENT IS VERY

TROUBLING.

DID YOU EVER KEEP HER LOCKED UP

IN HER ROOM?

>> IS THAT WHAT SHE SAYS?

>> SHE STATED THAT YOU HIT HER

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

>> MY MOTHER IS A COMPULSIVE

LIAR.

SHE'LL SAY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

GET WHAT SHE WANTS.

>> WHAT DOES SHE WANT NOW?

>> BESIDES A SLAVE, FOR ME TO

NOT MOVE IN TO APARTMENT 1303.

>> I CAN'T SAY I DISAGREE WITH

HER.

>> WHY?

>> WELL, YOU FIT THE PROFILE OF

THE WOMEN THAT JUMPED OFF THE

BALCONY THERE.

>> YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

FIRST YOU SAID, "APARTMENTS

DON'T KILL PEOPLE.

PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE."

AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT

APARTMENT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

WITH IT?

>> LARA, WHERE WERE YOU THE

NIGHT JANET DIED?

>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING

ME THAT.

MY SISTER DID NOT COMMIT

SUICIDE.

I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

HANDFUL.

>> PUT IT THIS WAY -- MY FATHER

REMARRIED RECENTLY.

WHEN I CALLED HIM TO TELL HIM

JANET DIED, HE SAID HE COULDN'T

COME TO THE FUNERAL ON THE OFF

CHANCE HE MIGHT RUN IN TO HER.

>> NICE.

[ CELLPHONE RINGING ]

>> OH.

SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

WHAT DO YOU WANT, MOM?

>> [ Slurring ] I need you to

come home, baby.

I can't sleep with you in that

apartment.

>> YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF

THAT BEFORE YOU FILED A

RESTRAINING ORDER.

>> No, that was completely

misinterpreted.

Just come home.

I want to talk.
