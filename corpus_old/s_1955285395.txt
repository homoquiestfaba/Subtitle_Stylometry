Most Of The Time
When You Think History,

You Think Boring, Right?

Ancient Civilizations

With Names You Can't Pronounce,
Dates, Facts--

I Mean, Who Cares?

But Sometimes, History Can Slam
Right Into The Present

And Totally Blow Your Mind.

The First Ever
Movie Theater In Our Town

Opened In 1925.

<I>Phantom Of The Opera
Was Its First Film.

But Times Changed.
Things Progressed,

And The Old Movie Theater
Bit The Dust.

Literally.

There Was A Rumor That One Faithful,
Old Moviegoer

Got Trapped Inside
When It Went Down.

Some Folks Even Claimed
He Survived.

Yeah, Right.

Anyway, A New Theater
Was Built

And New Movies
Were Shown

And All The While,
The Legend Grew.

Now Here I Am, 17,
Working At The Theater,

And We Still
Talk About The Guy.

Every Time A Piece Of Film Breaks Or The Lights Flicker,

We Have Someone To Blame.

Not That I Believe
In Any Phantom.

Truth Is, I've Got More
Important Things On My Mind.

That's Me. Pete Riley.

My Mom Thinks
I Work Way Too Hard,

But She Really
Doesn't Get It.

Do The Counts?

Yeah.

I'm The Youngest
Assistant Manager

They've Ever Had
At This 26-Screen Megaplex.

Hey, We're Talking Some Serious
Responsibility Here, Right?

Do You Know
On A Typical Saturday Night

We Have 52 People Working,

Sell 88 Pounds
Of Popcorn,

Move 7,000 Patrons In And Out,
And Have 63 Showings

With An Average Of 4-6 Minor Technical Glitches?

Whew! That's A Lot
To Keep Track Of. Trust Me.

That's Our Senior Manager,
Shawn Macgibbon.

He's Freaking Out
Because Our Theater Owner,

And Shawn's Personal Idol,
Wolfgang Nedermeyer,

Scored Like
The Coup Of The Century.

See, A Movie Called<I>
Midnight Mayhem

Filmed Not Too Far From Here,
Last Spring...

Nedermeyer Used
His Connections

To Talk The Filmmakers
Into Coming Back,

Right Here To Our Own
Grand Megaplex,

For The Big-Time
Hollywood-Style World Premiere.

Ok. Stop. Stop.

We're Going To Need One Of Us

On Either Side
And One In Back,

Or Someone's
Going To End Up

With A Major
Hernia, Ok?

That's Ricky Leary...

Or As We Call Him,
Ricky Rules.

No Matter What You're Doing,

Ricky's Got
The Procedure For It.

You Know, Once I Heard

These Kids Were Trying
To Push Something Like This,

And It Started Rolling Backwards
And It Crushed Them,

And One Kid Got Killed,
And The Other Ones Lost

A Bunch Of Fingers,
Toes, And Junk.

That's Terri Tortora...

Nicknamed Scary Terri.

She's Got A Hundred
Stories To Tell,

And All Of Them End In Death And Destruction.

All Right.
Great, You Guys.

Now, Um, Go Straighten Up
The Snack Bar.

This Is Fantastic.
Look What A Great Job We're Doing, Honey.

Aren't We So Efficient?

Hillary Horan...

A.K.A. Hillary Honey.

She's Like Your Grandma
In A Teenage Body.

Calls Everybody
Sweetie And Baby.

Always Wants To Make Sure
We're Eating Enough,

Wearing Warm Enough Clothes.

Hey, Mark Could You Please Sweep Down

The Carpet
For Me?

With A Broom,
You Mean?

Mark Jefferies...

Or As I Call Him,
Question Mark.

You Can't Say
Anything To Him

Without Getting A Hundred Questions In Response.

Yeah, With The Broom.

I Straightened Up
The Ticket Booth,

Cleaned Both Ladies' Rooms,

Washed The Popcorn Maker,
And Swept Inside The Elevator.

Now I--

Lacy Ling A.K.A.
Racy Lacy.

Why Walk
If You Can Run?

You Know What You Can Do For Me?

Head Upstairs,

Make Sure That
The Trash Cans

Have Been Emptied,
And Then Check To See

If That, Um,
Wind Machine Arrived

For Our Hollywood Display.

Read The Presentation Criteria
Checklist On My Booth Wall,

And, Uh,
You'd Know That Digital Soundtrack Mis-Threading

Is The Number One Cause
For, Uh, Customer Grievances.

That Guy? He's Our
Head Projectionist, Merle.

Ask A Simple Question,
Get A Way Too Complicated

Technospeak Answer
In Return.

Ahem.

Slow It Down,
My Dear.

Life Is Like A Good Movie:
Every Moment Should Be Savored.

Meet Movie Mason.

He Doesn't
Work Here.


It Was Mason's Family
Who Opened

The Original Theater On This Spot In The 1920s.

Mason Loves Movies
More Than Anything.

When They Tore His Place Down
To Build The Megaplex,

He Had A Hard Time
Letting Go.

My Schedule.

So, Each Week Mason Types Up His Work Schedule,

And Each Week
Shawn Files It.

Still, Mason
Shows Up Every Day,

And We're Always Happy
To See Him.

Anyway, It's Not Only The Premiere I'm Pumped About.

See There's This Girl,
Caitlin Kerigan,

And I Got Her
And Her Friend Lisa

Passes To An Early Movie
Into The Premiere.

Not Bad, Huh?

Now You Get Why Tonight

Everything Has To Be Totally,
100 % Perfect.

Aah!

Whoa!

I Cannot Stress Enough,
People,

That On A Night As Monumental As This One

Careers Are Going To Be Made
And Careers Will Be Broken.

Tonight, As The Eyes Of
The Entertainment World

Fall Upon Our
Humble Megaplex,

What I Want Them
To See Is Greatness:

Greatness That Can
Only Come From You Kids

And The Rest Of My Crack
Saturday Night Team.

To Quote Mr. Nedermeyer,

"It Is Service
That Can't Be Beat

That Puts A Butt
In Every Seat."

I Expect To See
The Straightest Bow Ties,

The Neatest Vests,
The Most Polished Shoes--

Whoa. Shawn,
Are You Sure?

Because Once I Heard These
Kids With Really Shiny Shoes--

No, No, No.
Shusha, Shusha.

Terri, Rise To My Level,
Or Be Gone.

For Those Of You
Who

Wish To

I Expect To See You Back Here Promptly At 3:00

To Start
Your Shifts.

3:00 Today, You Mean?

No, Mark. 3:00
A Year From Tuesday.

[Cell Phone Rings]
Ahem.


Yes.

Ahh, Mr. Nedermeyer.

You Did?

I See.

No, No.

If You Feel That Your Son-In-Law Is The Best Man

For The General
Manager's Job,

That's A Decision I Will Have To Respect.

Of Course, Sir.
We'll See You Both, Tonight.

We Are
Professionals.

Ahem.

And We Will
Act Like...

Professionals.

Um, On A--On
All Shows

Before The Premiere
This Evening,

We Will Get
The Customers In,

Get Them Out,
But Always Be Kind And Courteous.

In The Words
Of Mr. Nedermeyer,

"A Smile
At Every Door..."

"Keeps Them Coming Back
For More."

Yes. Yes.

You're A Good Man,
Pete.

You Might Go Places In This Organization.

And Since Mr. Nedermeyer Expects

The Impossible
This Evening,

If Anything
Does Go Wrong,

I'm Fully Prepared
To Blame You.

Dismissed!

You Always
Do This To Me.

You Tell Me You Want Me To Have A Life,

So And Then I Make Plans With My Friends,

And Then Suddenly,
At The Last Second,

You Say You Need Me
To Baby-Sit.

I Told You
Last Monday

I Needed You
For Tonight.

Was I Listening?

Are You Ever?

What's Up?

Mom's Going Out
With George Tonight.

Ahh! Think He Might
Finally Propose?

Why Do You Guys Keep Pushing This?

You And George
Are Great Together.

You're Always Happy
When He's Around.

Oh, Yeah.
You Know What You Should Do?

You Should Be Like
Gillie Blake In

<I>Always A Bridesmaid.

Tell Him How Great
You Look In White,

Ask Him If He Wants
To Play Old Maid,

And Then Tell Him
You'll Give Him A Ring

When You Get Home.

Does Every Reference In Your
Life Have To Be From A Movie?

Why Shouldn't It Be?

You Sound Exactly Like The Grouchy Old Dad

In

<I>Blank Scree.

Yeah, Well, I Just Think
It Would Be Cool

If Every Once In A While You
Two Lived In The Real World.

Boring.

Now About George...

George Will Propose If And When He's Ready.

Yeah, But As Wendy Dillon
Said In <I>Maybe Baby,

"Until You Apply
The Headlock...

Sister And Brother:
He Might Never Comply With Wedlock."

Mom, Can Karen
And I See

<I>Farmer Brown Goes To Town, Tonight?

Pete Said It's Not Going To Be Playing Much Longer,

And Tomorrow I've Got Baseball Practice All Day--

Why Can't Pete Take Him When
He Goes To Work, Tonight?

Then I Can Meet My Friends
To See <I>University Of Death.

Oh, You're Not Seeing That
Movie With Or Without Brian.

I Don't Like Those Bloody,
Sickening Things.

I'm Not Asking You
To See It.

Watch That Tone.

I Hate My Life!

You Still Treat Me
Like I'm 3 Years Old.

Oh, I Do Not.

Now Run In The House,
And I'll Fix You A Bottle.

I'm Not Laughing,
Mom.

Well, Start.
It Helps.

Ok. Final Offer.
You And Brian Can Go See <I>Farmer Brown,

Pete Can Drive You Home
On His Dinner Break,

And Then You Only
Have To Be On Duty

Till I Get Home
At Midnight.

Sounds Sweet.

To Who?

To Whom.

Tch!

Take It
Or Leave It, Hon.

And Even If I Didn't
Have A Date,

I Wouldn't Let You See<I>
College Of Blood.

Mom, It's <I>University Of Death.

Yeah, Well,
Same Difference.

Ugh!

Slow Down, Grog.

Nobody's Going To Steal Your Woolly Mammoth Meat.

Hmm! I'm Starving.

Obviously.

How Did It Go
Down At The Theater?

Oh, It Was So Cool.
Me And Ricky We Had To--

Ricky And I.

Ricky And I,
We Had To Put

This Huge Monster Blow-Up Thing
Above The Main Marquee.

They Had You
Up On The Roof?

Yeah, Mom. And I Fell Off,
Cracked My Skull,

And Now I'm Dead.

Ha Ha. Just For The Record,
I Don't Approve.

Uh, Ooh, Listen.
I Realize I Should Have Checked With You First,

But Would It Be Ok
For You To Drive

The Littles Home
On Your Break, Tonight?

They'll Be Long Gone Before The Start Of The Premiere.


Caitlin's Coming By.

I Snagged Her And A Friend
Passes For An Earlier Movie

And Then To Stay
For The Premiere.

They Won't Bother You.
I'll Make Them Promise.

Oh, I Just Don't Want
Them Coming Up

And Making Dumb Comments
And Stuff.

Pete, You Know
How Those Two Are.

Bombs Could Be Going Off When They're

Watching A Movie,
And It Wouldn't Distract Them.

Exactly Like Your Father That Way.

Who Loved The Movies
More Than Dad?

Yeah.

Sometimes I Wonder
If That's Why

You Ended Up
At The Megaplex.

Well, No Disrespect, Mom,
But I'm In It Strictly For The Cold, Hard Cash.

Uh, Yeah. Um,
Speaking Of Which,

Don't You Think You've Been Putting In

Too Many Hours
Down There?

We Go Over This Every Month.
The Answer Is Still, No.

I Love My Job.

Yeah, But All Work
And No Play--

Is Going To Make Me
Really, Really Rich.

And Burned Out
Before You're 30.

Pete, You're Young.
You Have Plenty Of Years To Work.

You Should Be Out
Enjoying Yourself.

Mom, Don't Worry
About It. I'm Fine.

Ok.

Tonight Sounds Like It's Going
To Be Pretty Great, Though.

Klieg Lights, Limousines,
Movie Stars.

Karen Said Sarah Joan Michelle Whatever,

Was Going To
Be There.

Madison Ashley Metz, Mom.

Isn't That
What I Said?

No, Really,
It Sounds So Exciting.

Are You Nervous?

Mom, We're
Professionals.

We Have Everything
Under Control.

It's A Disaster, A Total
Calamity.

I Am Talking
Fade Out. The End.

What's Going On?

Craig And Randy Just Both Phoned In Sick.

And Jenna, Well,
She's Simply Lost In The Ozone.

How Can Nearly Half Our Staff Pick Tonight,

Of All Nights,
To Simply Not Show Up?

And Nedermeyer Keeps Calling Every 5 Minutes

To See How
It's Going.

He Keeps Telling Me
This Premiere

Has To Go Off
Without A Flaw.

Without A Hitch.
Without One Single-- [Hiccup]

Oh, No.
Oh, No, No.

You See,
When I Get Nervous I-- [Hiccup]

Go! Get Me Water
From The Snack Bar.

Flat, No Bubbles.
Go!

Ok.


Heard The Latest?

Since We're
So Understaffed,

All Breaks And Dinner Hours Have Been Cancelled,

Which Is <I>Huge Violation
Of Our Union Contract.

Ahem.

But I Guess
Tonight's

Not The Night
To Get Into

Shawn's Face
About It.

Good Instincts, Ricky.

I Heard Once, These Kids
At This Restaurant

Didn't Get
Their Dinner Break,

And They All
Started Fainting.

And Then--

Blood, Guts, Death, Destruction.
I Mean, Come On, Terri.

Like We Haven't Heard It,
Like, A Thousand Times.

We're Never Going To Get Through This.

Even If We Didn't Have
The Premiere,

This Is Way Too Much Stu
For Us To Handle.

Hey, Tough Up, Rookies.

To Quote Shawn
Quoting Nedermeyer,

"If You Don't
Want To Get Canned,

Give Your Very Best
To The Grand."

Now Make This Bigger.

Are You Bringing That To Put Up
The Net For The Balloon Drop?

Check It Out.
Shawn's Completely 3 Steps Ahead Of You Guys.

Man, Is He Dedicated
Or What?

Even Though He Didn't Get
The General Manager Job,

He's Still Hustling
Like A Maniac.

[Evil Laugh]

Now Listen.
We Need To Figure This Out

Before My Mom Gets
Out Of The Shower.

So She's Dropping Brian And Me Off
At 7:30 For A 7:40 <I>Farmer Brown.

So I Need To Do The 7:50<I>
University Of Death

So I Can Get
Brian All Settled,

Then Can Sit
With You Guys.

I Told Her It Was Pg-13.

But She's Still
All Freaked Out.

Thinks It's Going To Be
Too Violent And--

I--I Totally Agree.

We See Worse Things
On The 6:00 News.

Ok, Perfect.

So I'll See You Guys, Outside, 7:50,<I>
University Of Death.

Ok, Bye.

<I>University Of Death?

You're Supposed To See<I>
Farmer Brown With Me.

Remember?

Look. I'll Get You In.
I'll Get You Settled.

Yeah, Right.
Then Ditch Me.

Like You're Going
To Even Notice.

What If It Turns Into, Like,<I>
Waldorf's Revenge?

Where That, You Know,
Criminal Guy Runs Into

The Theater And Grabs That Innocent Kid Hostage?

That Won't Happen, Brian.

Or--Or What If
It's Like In <I>Flood?

And The Whole Place Starts To Flood,
But I'm [Gurgling]

Trapped?

Or What If I Pay You
5 Bucks And Take You To See

Power Penguins Foiling
Big Glory Next Weekend?

10 Bucks And 2 Movies.

10 Bucks, <I>Power Penguins,
And A Large Candy

Let Me Think About It.

Hmm. Let Me Think About What?

Ohh, Uh. Whether He, Um,

Whether He Wants To
Wash Or Dry The Dishes.

Mm-Hmm.

Movie Mason: Good Evening.
Enjoy The Show.

Enjoy The Show, Sir.
Enjoy The Show.

Uh, Hello, Mrs, Johnson.
I Love Your Earrings.

Hello, Gentlemen.
How Are You?

Hey, Movie Mason.
Rippin' Tux.

Uh, Enjoy The Show.

Female Employee: Next.

Uhh, Uhh!

Oh, One More Try.

No.

Next!

May I Have Some
Nachos, Please,

With Some
Extra Cheese?

Female Customer: Can I Get
A Large Soda, Please?

Ok, You've Got Enough
Popcorn Tubs, Lids.

Looks Like All
You Need Now Is Cups.

And Straws, Ok?

Cups And Straws.
Cups And Straws.

Lookin',
Sharp There, Petey.

What're You
Doing Here, Hollie?

We Heard Caitlin And Lisa Were
Going To Be Around, Tonight.

What Movie Did You
Give Them Passes For?

I Forget, Ok?

I'm Busy.

Why Does That Dog Make It So Easy

For Me To Rattle
His Cage?

My Whole Life Donny Hollie's
Been Like Some Dark Shadow.

In School,
Sports, Girls.

If I Want It,
He Wants It.

He's The One
Who Usually Gets It.

Well, Does He Know That You Like Caitlin, Hon?

Think It's Just A Coincidence He Showed Up, Tonight?

Now I'll Be Working
My Buns Off,

He'll Hunt Her Down,
Pour On Some Of His Gross Charm.

I Hate Donny.

You Know, Never Worked
A Day In His Life.

All The Girls Think
He's Just So Good Looking.

He's Has
A Totally Perfect Life.

But You Are So
Way Sweeter, Doll.

Since When Does
That Count For Anything?

You Know, Girls Like Caitlin
Want Guys With Decent Cars,

You Know, Money To Spend
On Dates.

I'm Earning Cash
Just To Compete.

Woman: This Is
Ridiculous!

Second Woman:
Hey, Don't Push.

I Understand It.

Girl: This Is Taking
Forever!

Woman: Why?

Hey, Zeke,
What's The Deal?

Shouldn't Shawn Open Up
Another Line?

There's Nobody
To Man It, Man.

It's Crazy!
Workin' My Fingers Off Here.

Not Tonight, Man.

Whoa, Folks.
Settle Down.

Look, Everybody's Going To Make It Inside,
All Right?

Eventually.

Young Shawn,
When Can I Expect You

To Respond To My Proposal
About Putting A Live Organ--

Not Now, Mason.
I'm Swamped, Ok?

How's It Going, Men?

You've Got To Get Us Some Help, Boss.
This Is Weak.

Am I Houdini?

Am I Supposed To Pull An Employee Out Of My Hat?

Relax, Young Shawn.

I Would Gladly Abandon
My Greater Post

To Answer The Desperate
Call To Arms

To Become A Ticket Taker.

There's Only
One Problem, Mason.

You Don't Work Here. Ok?

Now You Tell Him.

A Man In Crisis
Should Not Be Burdened

By Irrelevant Details.

So You'd Stand Here
And Take Tickets

Even If I Can't Pay You?

Shawn, Movies Are Not
About Commerce, My Friend.

Movies Are About Magic.

Is That A Yes Or A No?

Hey, If He Wants To Do It, Shawn,
Let Him.

Not Since I Was Made
Head Usher

At The Saul And Gettle
Sand Palace Of Burlesque

Has My Heart Been Filled
With Such Pride.

In The Name Of The Great
Cecil B. De Mille,

I Will Not Let You Down.

Whatever. Just Stand There,
Hand Half The Ticket Back,

And Keep The People Moving.

Watch Him.

[Cell Phone Rings]

Oh, Nedermeyer Will Not Be Happy
Until I Have A Nervous Breakdown.

Hey, Mason.

Hello, Son.
Enjoy The Show.

Oh, I Take This.

Thank You.

Here, This Is
The Other Half.

Make Sure Pete
Knows You're Here.

Don't Leave The Theater Without Him,

And Don't
Talk To Strangers.

You Have Money And My Pager Number, Right?

Mom, We're Going To See
A Movie,

Not Crossing The Atlantic
In A Canoe.

George: Trust Them,
Pocahontas.

Hey, They've
Got This Wired.

See, Look! George Gets It!

Besides, Mom,
It's Not Even Dark Yet.

Plus, Since They Hired
Those Cinema Sitters,

We Couldn't Get
Away With Anything

Even If We Wanted To.

Well, Good.
Love You Guys.

Love You, Too.

Remember, No Headlock,
No Wedlock.

Go On! Get Out Of Here!

And No <I>Corpse School!

I'm Guessing She Means <I>University Of Death.

George: So, What
Was That All About?

Nothing.
They Are Genuinely Crazy About You, George,

And You Have No Idea How Flattered You Should Be.

First Female: What's The Hold-Up?
What's Going On?

First Male:
What's The Hold-Up?

Second Male: Any Night!

Third Male: Let's Go!
Let's Go!

Go See Why
We're Not Moving, Bri.

I'll Hold Our Place.

Ok.

Fourth Male: Hey,
Is That Kid Cutting In Line?

Fifth Male: Man!

Second Female:
I Need Some Air.

Sixth Male: Hurry Up!

Third Female: Come On!
What's The Hold-Up?

Mason: I'm Sorry.

We Appreciate
Your Opinion, Guy.

We Just Don't
Happen To Care.

Considering The Steep Cost Of The Ticket, Friend,

I'm Simply Hoping
To Maximize The Pleasure

Of Your Movie-Going
Experience

By Telling You That
The Film You've Selected

Is What
We In The Industry

Commonly Refer To
As A Stinker.

Mason,
They Don't Want To Hear

Your Opinion, All Right?

You're Backing The Lines Up

Into Next Thursday.

Be That As It May,
My Boy,

Cinema Is Sacred.

Each Experience
Should Transport Us

To A World
Worthy Of Our Time

And Hard-Earned Cash.

Listen, Why Don't You
Just Take Our Tickets

And Let Us In, Buddy!

First Man: Yeah!

Second Man: Come On!

Woman: Come On, Mason!

So, What Happened?

If We're Lucky,
We Might Get To See A Riot.

Movie Mason's
A Ticket Taker,

But He's Not
Letting People

Into Movies
He Doesn't Like.

Did You See Pete?

No, But Something's
Up, Though.

If They've Got
Mason Working,

Who Knows
What's Going On?

<I>Glimpses Of Genevieve Has Been
Nominated For More Awards

Than All 5 Of Last
Year's Oscar Nominees.

Jeez! We Don't Care!

You Owe It To Yourself
To Give It A Chance.

You Want To Give
This A Chance?

Pete: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!
Sir, Please!

You Just
Settle Down.

Well, Tell This Guy To
Cut With The Critic Act

And Let Us
Into Our Movie!

I'm Only Attempting
To Impart To Him

That The Magic Of The Movies Is A Treasure

Not To Be Taken Lightly.

Mason? Here! Now!

Crowd: Ooh!

Man: Yeah! Spank Him!

First Woman: Whoo Hoo!

Man: Spank Him!
Bye-Bye, Now!

Second Woman:
Come On! Yeah!

I, Sir,
Do Not Appreciate Being Spoken To

As If I Were
A Canine.

Well, I Just Heard
From Mr. Nedermeyer

Who Says That You Are An Insurance
Liability Waiting To Happen,

And He Wants You
Out Of Here Immediately.


This Is An Outrage!

Save It For Someone
Who Cares. Go!

You Can't Treat Movie Mason Like This!

He's A Legend!

Yeah!

Shawn: Not To Me!

Look,

I'm Under Enough
Pressure Tonight,

Old-Timer,

So Scram
Or I'll Call The Police.

Mason: Enjoy Your Show!

Tell My Theater That
Even When I'm Not Here,

Its Magic Is Never Far
From My Heart.

Someday, You'll
Have To Explain To Me

How People Like
You And Mason

Can Get So Worked Up
About Movies.

Maybe It's Because We Have Fun,
Mr. Assistant Manager,

Something You Obviously
Can't Relate To.

Why? Because I'd Rather
Earn A Few Bucks

Than Sit In A Dark
Theater Daydreaming?

No.
Because You're So Locked Into Achievement Mode,

You're Like The Oldest-Looking Teenager I Know.

Can I Get Some
Vending Candy?

Yeah.

Look, You And Brian Get In To
Your Show And Behave, Ok?

We're Way
Too Shorthanded,

We Got
This Huge Premiere,

And Nedermeyer Calls
Every 5 Seconds

To Say That Everything Has To Be Totally...

Perfect.

You Know, If You
Want To Impress Her,

It's Probably
Better Not To Drool.

Grow Up!

I'm Trying To,
But Mom Won't Let Me.

What'd You Do?

Uh... I Didn't Do Anything!

I Just Lifted It Up,

And It Snapped Right Off!

We Can't Interrupt Pete Right Now,
Or He'll Go Nuts.

Why Can't I Just, You Know,

Put It Down And Run?

Hey, What's The Problem,
Little Pete?

Uh... Uh... This Came Off,
But It's Not My Fault.

I Was Just...
Uh, I Was Just...

It's No Biggie, Kid.
All You Gotta Do

Is Just
Pop It Back On...

Uhh!

Like This.

Uhh!

Aah!

Wh-Wh-Whoa!

Aah! Uhh!

Aah! Uhh!

What The Heck
Did You Do, Kid?

He Didn't Do It,
Donny. You Did.

Hey! I Barely
Touched It.

Uhh!

Phantom Of The Megaplex Strikes Again!

Let's Go.

Woman: What's Next?

Excuse Me, Ladies.
Duty Calls.

Excuse Me.
Excuse Me.

Excuse Me.
Comin' Through.

Come On!
Let's Go!

[Cheers And Applause]

Whoa!

Go!

Go!

Go!



Wah!

Oh... Wah!

[Cheers And Applause]

Whoo!

Yeah!


Hey, That Was Sweet.

Welcome To Your Doom

Aren't You Just
Dying To Enter?


Man: Oh, Yeah!
You're Gonna Have Nightmares

When This Is Over.

Man, Could You Guys
Have Cut It Any Closer?

The Movie Starts
In, Like, 15 Seconds.

Is Erica Saving Us Seats?

Better Hope So, Huh?

Go In.
I'll Be Right There.

Gotta Get
The Bri Guy Set Up.

You Make It Sound
Like I'm A Beach Chair.

I'll See You In 5.

Come On!

Announcer:
At Our Refreshment Center,

You'll Find A Large
Variety Of Goodies

To Satisfy Your Hunger,
Your Thirst,

Or Your Sweet Tooth.
So, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry!

Visit Our
Refreshment Center Today.

Ok. You Remember,

If Pete Comes In
To Check On Us,

Just Say I'm In
The Ladies Room, Ok?

If He Comes Back
A Second Time,

Then Just, You Know,
Make Up Another Excuse.

What If He Goes
Looking For You?

That's My Problem.

Look, If You Want Your 10 Bucks And A Free Movie,

You'd Better Not
Blow This For Me, Ok?

Ok. Happy Nightmares.

You Sure
You're Ok With This?

No Offense, But
I Can See You Anytime.

I'm Here To See A Movie.

Ok. You're Gonna Stay Here, Right,
No Matter What,

And You're Gonna Be In This Exact
Spot When I Get Back, Right?

Ok.

You Better,
Or I'll Tell The Cinema Sitter.


Announcer:
The Grand Megaplex

Invites You To Refrain
From Using Cell Phones

And Pagers During The Movie.

Hey, You Know
Madison Ashley Metz

Isn't The Only Movie Star Who's Gonna Be Here Tonight.

I Heard, You Know,
What's-His-Name

From <I>Loflin's Dream
Is Coming, Too.

Jacob Johnson?

You Mean,
Jacob Johnson's Gonna Be Here?

That's What
My Sources Tell Me.

I Don't
Mean To Brag,

But Since I'm The Assistant Manager,

I Might Be Able To Introduce You To Him.

I Don't Know
If I Could Handle It.

How Raw Would That Be To, Like,
Touch Jacob Johnson's Hand?

Could We Maybe Get
A Picture With Him?

If That's
What You Want,

It's My Job
To Make It Happen.

I Didn't Know You Had
So Much Power Around Here.

Are You Kidding?

By The Time I'm 18,

I'll Probably Be
Running This Place,

And Since They Just Named A New General Manager,

I Might Even Get
A Promotion Tonight.

Will You Still Get To Wear Your Little Red Bow Tie?

Are You Making Fun
Of My Bow Tie?

No. I Love It.
I Totally Do.

Scary Thing Is,
She's Serious.

Pete: Here.

Uh, Guard It
With Your Life.

Sorry To Bust Up Your
Little Party Here, Petie,

But Hillary And Lacy
Are Lookin' For Ya.

Something About
A Popcorn Emergency? Ha Ha!

See Ya! [Laughs]

What's Going On?

Girl: Get The Manager!

It's Like Those
Battery Commercials.

We Put The Exact Amount In For One Batch,

Like We Always Do,

But It Just Keeps Going And Going And Going.

Look At This, Hon'.

Why Don't You
Just Shut It Off?

We Flipped The Switch, Like,
50 Times, But It Didn't Do Anything!

Why Don't You
Just Try This, Huh?

[Crowd Laughs]

Why Didn't We
Think Of That?

Better
Clean This Up.

I'll Get The Broom
And Dustpan?

Yeah.

Excuse Me!

Excuse Me, My Dear.

I'm Not A Complainer
By Nature,

But You Really Must Come
Inside And Look At This.

When We Paid To See<I>
Glimpses Of Genevieve,

We Had No Idea
That The Title

Would Be So...
Literal.

[Crowd Yells]

First Man: Hey, Man!
What's Going On With This Thing?

It's Crazy!

Fix The Projector!

Focus! Come On, Focus!

[Crowd Yells]

Second Man:
These Rotten Kids!

We'll Squawk Until They Do Something About It!

Excuse Me.

Hillary!

Where's Shawn?

Well, Did You Try
His Office, Sweetie?

He's Not In There.
What About Pete?

I Think
He's In Theater 17,

Checking On
His Little Brother.

8.75.

Oh! What's Going On Now?

How Long Does It Take
To Go To The Bathroom?

When You're A Girl,
Forever.


But You're Ok Here,
Right?

Woman In Movie:
But I Want To Go!

Emergency
In Theater 23.


W-W-What Kind Of An Emergency?
Can I Come?

No. Stay.

Woman In Movie:
Oh! It's Not Fair!

I Always Get Left Behind.

Now, No Matter
What Happens, Baby,

I Want You To Promise Me You'll Stay Right Here.

Oh!

[Crowd Jeering
And Yelling]

Folks? Uh, Excuse Me.

If I Could Have
Your Attention,

I'm Pete Riley,
The Assistant Manager Here.

What, Do You
Want A Medal?

[Crowd Laughs]

Uh, We're Hoping To Have
This Problem

With The Projector
Fixed Soon.

Uh, We're Gonna Start
Your Movie Over,

Or, If You'd Rather
Get Your Money Back,

You Can See Me In The Lobby
For A Full Refund

Or A Return Pass.

Thanks A Lot. Thanks.

[Crowd Jeers And Yells]

This Isn't An Accident,
You Know.

It's Sabotage,
Exactly Like In <I>Judson's Revenge.

I Thought I Told You
To Stay In Your Seat.

I'm Just Trying
To Help, Ok?

See, I'm Betting That The Phantom Of The Megaplex

Doesn't Like Your Bringing A Big Hollywood Party

Into His Home.

Brian? Hey,
Don't Start With Me, Ok?

We Have 26 Screens Here.

Things Are
Always Going Wrong.

Yeah, But All In One Night?
I Mean, Come On!

The Candy Bin
Crashing Down,

And Now This
Focus Thing?

Yeah. You Don't Even Know About
The Maniac Popcorn Machine.

See?<I>
Judson's Reve,

In

The Guy,
Kevin Eastman...

See,
What Happens Is,

He Thinks
He's Been Cheated

By This Big
Power Company,

But No One'll Listen To Him.
He Has To...

All Right. Enough, Ok?

Get Back
To

<I>Farmer Bro Now.

Ok, But I'm Tellin' Ya,
Sabotage.

[Eerie Laugh]

Hyah!

[Makes Karate Sound]

[Eerie Laugh]

This Is So Crazy!

It's Like,
Every Step We Take,

Somebody's
Watching Us.

Uh-Huh.

Duh! It's A Horror Movie.

Isn't He So
Unbelievably Cute?

I Dare You To Scream
"I Love Phil Dalton"

At The Top Of Your Lungs.

Why Don't You?

Are You Insane?

Never Dare April
To Do Anything.

She Won't Do It.

You Guys,
You're Gonna Get Us So Kicked Out Of Here.

Woman In Movie: Come On!
Let's Go! Let's Just Go!

Man In Movie: No! No!

My Name Is Karen Riley,
And I Love Phil Dalton.

Shh!

I Can't Believe
You Did That!

Sorry!

Pipe Down Back There!

Time To
Go Check On Brian.

Wait! I'm Scared!

Man In Movie:
What? Oh, Man!

Man In Movie:
They're Gone!

I Turn My Back
For One Second...

I Don't Get It.

Where'd Everything Go?

Is Something Wrong, Dear?

Oh, No, No, No. No, Uh,
When I Was In The Bathroom,

I Guess My Brother
Had To Go.

Shh!

Shh!

He'll Be Back.

Man In Movie:
Caroline?

Caroline, Honey?

Why? Why? I Begged You
To Stay Put!


[Crowd Talking]

I Don't Know Why
Shawn Isn't Answering

His Cell Phone,
Mr. Nedermeyer.

Um, Uh, He's, Uh...

He's--He's Outside
Doing, Um, Uh...

Right, Premiere Stuff.

Uh, Yes, Sir.

The Minute He Comes In,
I'll Have Him Call You.

This Is Way Against
Operating Procedure.

Where Is Shawn?

Nedermeyer's Gonna
Blow A Motherboard

If He Doesn't
Hear From Him.

I Think It's Scary.
Shawn Wouldn't Disappear Tonight.

Shawn Wouldn't
Disappear Ever.

Running This Place
Is His Life.

What If The Phantom Of The Megaplex Got Him?

Don't Even Joke,
Ok, Hon'?

Stuff Like That
Totally Creeps Me Out.

Afraid He'll
Suck Your Blood?

Want To Hear The Latest?

The Second Pete Got
The Projector Fixed

In Theater 22,

And There's A Whole
New Disaster In 21.

Come On, Lacy.

Let's Go Find Shawn.


Pete: And Now, <I>Cut To Black,
Our Most Popular Movie,

Has The Lights
Going Berserk,

And I Don't Know
How To Stop It.

I Mean, All I Know
Is That The Lights

Are Tied Into
The Same Computer Program

As The Projection System.

Why Isn't Merle Up Here?

Merle The Projectionist?

But He's The Only One
Who Showed Up Here Tonight.

How's He Supposed To Be
In All 3 Booths At Once?

He's Probably In West 4
Getting A <I>Martian Mountain

Uh, Well, Go Grab Him, Mark.
Tell Him It's An Emergency.

All Right.

[Crowd Yells]

How Can A Whole Computer Program
Go Into Spontaneous Meltdown?

Like I Said Before,
Sabotage!

How'd You Get Up Here?

I Was In Indian Guides,
Remember?

I Slipped In
When Mark Slipped Out.

I'm Only Trying To Help,
Ok, Pete?

Ok, Well, Don't, Ok?

I Have Too Much
To Deal With Already.

Man! It's So Cool
In Here!

Let Me Guess.
Karen Has Absolutely No Clue Where You Are.

Who Cares?
I'm Telling You,

You Need Me To
Help You Solve This.

You Do!

There's Nothing
To Solve, Brian.

Oh, Yeah?

How Come Nobody In This
Whole Place Can Find Shawn?

Shawn's Still Missing?

This Is Really Getting Weird.
Where Could He Be?

I Heard Once
There Was This Multiplex

In Like Oregon Or "Michigon" Or One Of Those Places,

And Every Saturday Night For 2 Months,
A Different Guy...

[Eerie Laugh]

Aah! Oh!
What The Heck Was That?

[Door Opens]


Oh!


Lose Somebody?

Oh, Uh, It's
My Little Brother.

You Mean You Still
Haven't Found Him?

No, No. He Came Back,
But Now He's Gone Again.

Oh!

What's His Name?

Brian. Brian Riley.

If Brian Riley
Is Present,

Please Finish
Your Business Promptly

And Report
To Your Sister At Once!

Now, When He Emerges,

I Want You Two To Get Into Your Seats And Stay Put.


[Crowd Yells]

No Torn
Sprocket Hole

That's Confusing
The Computer.

No Stripped Brains.

No Tripped Trees.

I Don't Know.

Yeah.
Platter's In Place.

Ok. So I Don't Have As
Much To Do Around Here

Since We Went
Into Full Automation.

Somehow, The Powers That Be
Think That's Progress.

Who Am I To Argue?

But, Uh,
While I'm Underpaid

And Under-Appreciated,

I'm Still <I>Numero Uno
At Figuring Out

How And Why Things Go Wrong.

Ok, Master Merle,
Enlighten Me.

Well, I Think The Problem Here,
My Friend,

Is, Uh, Someone's
Deliberate Attempt

To Ruin
Our Big Night.

Thank You.
I've Only Been Trying

To Tell Him That
For The Last Hour.

Well, Can We
Straighten It Out?

If I Can't,
Nobody Can,

But It's Gonna
Take A Few Minutes.

Ok.
Well, If You've Got Everything Under Control Here,

I'm Gonna Head Downstairs To Prevent A Riot.


Pete: Please, If I
Could Just Have Your...

I'm Really Just Trying
To Tell You,

If You Just... Excuse Me!

Quiet!

Thanks.

Told You I Was
Good To Have Around.

Folks, I Know This Has
Been Very Frustrating,

But Your Movie Will Be
Starting Over Momentarily.

If You'd Rather Leave Now,

Refunds Can Be Obtained
In The Main Lobby

From My Senior Manager
Shawn Macgibbon.

If Anyone Can Find Him.

We Apologize
For Any Inconvenience.

Good Job!

[Crowd Talks]

This Is Getting
Way Totally Spooky.

Terri And I Looked
Everywhere For Shawn.

We Absolutely
Can't Find Him.

And Then, When We Were
Coming Out Of His Office,

This Total Guy In Black
Shot Out Of Nowhere

And Ran Down The Stairs.

I Am So Not Kidding.
We Both Saw Him.

Brian: Why Won't
You Guys Admit It?

It's The Phantom
Of The Megaplex.

And Nedermeyer, He Keeps
Calling For Shawn.

Plus, You Know The Fog
Machine He Had Delivered

So It'd Be Going Off
When The Guests Arrived

For The Premiere?

Now It's Disappeared,

And Nobody's Even Gotten
The Velvet Ropes

For The Red Carpet Out Of
The Downstairs Lobby Yet.

Ok. Brian, I Need You.

About Time
You Admitted It.

Yeah.

When I Find
That Little Brat,

I'm Gonna Pound Him,
I Swear.

Thanks To Him,
I've Got The Cinema Sitter

Turning Into My Own
Personal Stalker.

You Want To Bet The Bri Guy's
Messing With You On Purpose?

Shh!

Shh!

I'm Not The One
Who's Talking.

You Are Now.

Got To
Go Find Brian.

You're Missing
The Whole Movie.

Mother's Magic.

She Didn't Want Me To See This Movie,

Now I'm Not.


Shawn? Is That You?

Oh, Man!
Who Did This To You?

[Muffled Speech]

Probably Be Easier
For Him To Answer

If You Took The Tape Off.

[Muffled Speech]

[Makes
Startled Noise]

[Tape Rips Loudly]

Pete: Uhh!

I--Ha Ha!

What Happened?


I Don't Have A Clue.

I, Uh,
I Came Down Here

To Get These Ropes.

Someone Shoved Me
From Behind,

Held Me Down,
Tied My Hands,

Put Tape
Over My Mouth,

Before
I Saw A Thing!

Â™ª Da Da Da

Phantom Of
The Megaplex Is Back!

[Clears Throat] Sir?
It's Not That I Didn't Want To Answer Your Calls.

I Was Simply...
Tied Up. Ha Ha!

You And Lamonica Are Having Dinner With Who, Sir?

I Am Impressed!

How Soon?

No, No.
Please, Don't Rush.

Really. Stay.
Have A Nice, Long Dessert.

We'll Have Everything In Order
For You When You Arrive.

60 Minutes! Do You Hear Me?

Yes! In One Short Hour,
Nedermeyer Will Arrive

With That Waste Of Sweat
Lamonica And Tyler Jesseman.

Yes! The Director
Of

<I>Midnight Mayhem.

We Must Find Out
Who Is Causing This Chaos

And Make It Stop. All Right?

Pete, Ricky, Inside.

Someone Take Half-Pint
Back To His Show,

And Please
Check All Theaters

For Any Signs Of Trouble.

Where Is Your Bow Tie?

Uh, I'll
Go Get It.

Go! Go, Go, Go!

There You Are!
Finally!

Yeah. Nice Job
Of Watching Brian.

I Can Explain!

[Escalator Jolts]

Oh, Great!

All Right,
Get To The Top.

[Escalator
Reverses Direction]

Oh, Good.

Come On!

Do You See What I'm Up Against Tonight?

Yeah! Fighting
The Phantom!

Look.
Either You Two Get Into Your Seats In

<I>Farmer Brown

And Stay There,

Or I'm Running You
Home Right Now.

I'm Totally Serious.

Wow!
There's A Big Shock!

You Being Serious?

Catch Me!
I'm About To Faint.

Brian:
I Know We Promised,

But Don't You
Want To Be A Hero?

You're So Lame,
Brian.

We're Not Gonna Stop
What's Going On Here.

Why Not?

What Did Dad
Always Say, Huh?

If You Pay Attention,

The Movies Can
Teach You About Life.

How Is That Relevant?

Don't You Get
What This Guy's Doing?

In <I>Glimpses
Of Genevieve,

The Projector
Was Going Nuts.

Glimpses, See?

In

<I>Cut To Black,

The Lights Were Going
On And Off.

The Titles
Match The Troubles.

Exactly. So What You
And Me Need To Do

Is Figure Out Where
He's Gonna Strike Next.

Right!

[Crowd Screams]

Come On!

[Crowd Screaming]

What Happened
To The Fan?

Run For Your Lives,
Children!

It's A Tornado!

Excellent!

[Strong Wind Blows]

[Panicked Screaming]

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

Ow!

Look!
There's Caitlin!

Who?

Duh! The Girl
Pete Likes!

Ah-Choo!

Aah! Aah!

Sorry!

Thanks!

Don't Worry, Ladies!

I'll Take Care Of It!


Whoa!

Good Look On You, Donny.

You Should Adopt It
Permanently!

Come On! Let's Go!

Ok, Ok, Ok!

Oh! Uhh!


Come Here! Come Here!

Uhh!

[Fan Stops Blowing]


Oh Batting A
Thousand, Huh?

A Lost Reservation And No Room For Us At

<I>Chez Patric?

This Joint's Suddenly Gone Belly Up.

Well, So Much For
Our Perfect Evening.

It's Ok. George,
Do You See Those Plants

Hanging Over There?

They Seem Perfectly
Content, Don't They?

Sure. They Look Great.

So, It Wouldn't Really Make Any Sense To Uproot Them,

Put Them Into
A Single Pot,

Impose, You Know,
Some Kind Of Forced Blending Thing.

Ha!

Well,
You Could Do That,

But If It Got
All Messed Up,

Uh, Don't You
Run The Risk

Of Ruining
Them Both?

I Mean, The Roots
Get Entangled

And The Stems
Get Twisted And...

Yeah.

It's Not Just The Plants That You Have To Think About.

What About The Buds?

I Mean,
How Would They React

To This, Uh,
Turf Invasion?

Hey,
Don't Get Me Wrong.

It's Not That I'm Afraid Of Re-Potting.

I Just Think You Have To Take It Slow,

You Know,

Examine Every Angle.

Mm-Hmm.

I Agree.


Personally, I've Never Been Comfortable

Trying Anything That I Wasn't Sure I Could Succeed At.

Maybe All We Can Do Is Trust That
If And When The Time Is Right,

We'll Both Know It.

Ok.

[Pager Goes Off]

Ooh! Who's This?

It's Not A Number
I Recognize.

Here.

Here.

[Dials Cell Phone]

[Telephone Rings]

Mom?

Pete! Where Are You?

The Lobby Pay Phone.

Is Anything Wrong?

No, No, Everything's Fine...

Sort Of. Um, Mom,
I Really Hate To Do This,

But Shawn Canceled All Dinner Breaks
Tonight Since We're So Understaffed,

And I Thought I Could
Bring The Kids Home,

Only We're So Not Ready
For The Premiere.

You Need Me To Pick Up
Brian And Karen.

It's No Problem.
I'll Bring George With Me.

Sorry.

No, I Don't Want Them
Standing On The Street.

Tell 'Em To Sit
On That Blue Bench

Down In The Lower Lobby.
I'll Meet Them There.

All Right. Thanks.

Another Change Of Plans.
I'm Sorry.

We've Gotta Go Pick Up
Brian And Karen.

[Engine Cranks]

[Engine Cranks]

Oh, No.

Pete: You Guys Were Never Gonna
Get To Stay For The Premiere Anyway,

So I Don't Know What
You're Moaning About.

Besides, Mom And George
Are Already On Their Way.

Man, We Don't Even Get To
Find Out Who The Phantom Is?

Riley, It's
Movie Mason--

Our So-Called
Phantom.

Think About It.

He's Ticked At Me For Having Tossed Him Out.

He's Never Gotten Over The Fact

That He Doesn't Still Own This Place.

What Better
Revenge Than

Ruining Our
Biggest Night?

Mason Would Never Do
Anything That Mean.

Movies Are Like--Like
Sacred To Him!

In My Opinion,
That Crazy Old Coot

Is Capable
Of Anything.

You Don't
Know Him At All.

He's, Like,
The Sweetest Person That Ever Lived.

Why Are These Small...
People Talking To Me?

Guys, Will You Just Cool It,
All Right? This Doesn't Concern You.

It Does If He's Gonna Go Around
Bad-Mouthing Movie Mason!

Karen: Yeah!

I Am
Telling You,

He Is Our Phantom And I Want Him Found.

All Right, I Gotta Go
Look For Mason.

I Want You Two
Sitting On This Bench.

I Don't Want You Doing Anything
Till Mom Gets Here, Ok?

Reporter:... Connie,
I'm Standing In Front

Of The Grand Theater
Downtown,

Where The Premiere
Of

<I>Midnight...

Movie Mason Never Came Back, Right?

No.

Good.

Wait A Sec. I Saw Him.
About An Hour Ago.

He Decided
To Forgive Shawn

And Bought A Ticket
To

<I>Merlin On Mars.

Gross!

It's Movie Mason's
Work Schedule.

Why Does He Have A Work
Schedule If He Doesn't Work Here?

Pete Says Every Week
Mason Types It All Up,

And Every Week Shawn
Tosses It Out.

Hmm. This Is
Very Interesting.

I'll Be Right Back.

We're Not Supposed To Leave This Bench, Remember?

Hillary, Hi.
You Remember Me, Right?

Brian, Pete's
Little Brother?

Brian, Honey!
How Are You?

Wow!
Look How Tall You're Getting.

Movie Mason... When He
Takes His Dinner Breaks,

Where Does He Go?

Why Are We Doing This?

We're Gonna Get
In So Much Trouble.

I Didn't Say You Had
To Follow Me.

Well, Yeah, Well, What
Was I Supposed To Do?

Be Sitting There All Alone
When Mom Arrives?

"Where's Brian?"
Gee, I Have No Idea.

God, How Grounded
Would I Be?

Not To Mention,
This Is For Employees Only.

I Mean, How Do You
Know About It?

I Came Down Here
With Pete Earlier.

And We're Heading Back Down Here Now Because?

Hillary Said Mason

Always Takes His Dinner Breaks In The Basement.

Why? What's
Down Here?

Probably Spiders And--
And Rats And--

[Evil Laughter]

Whoa!

The Phantom?

We Gotta Get
Out Of Here.

Are You Nuts?
We Can't Bail Now.

This Is Exactly Like In <I>Officer Bean,
Talented Teen Ii.

Look, I Don't Care.

Mom Is Gonna Be Waiting For Us.
Now Come On!

No, Just Think
How Proud She'll Be

When We Show Up With The Unmasked Phantom.

Brian. Brian!

I Checked Both <I>Merlin
On Mars Shows. Mason's

I Hate Thinking That Sweet Old
Man Could Be The Phantom.

Oh, Good. They're Gone.

Heh. At Least Something Finally
Went The Way It Was Supposed To.

I Do This Like I'll Actually Know Something.

I'm An English
Teacher!

But, A Car Breaks Down And A Guy Automatically

Looks Under
The Hood.

Ok, Have I Been Macho Long
Enough Now To Call The Auto Club?

Yes, And Then I'll Call The Theater
And Give The Kids A Heads-Up.

Karen: I Hate This!
We Shouldn't Be Here.

We Should Be Upstairs
Waiting For Mom.

Shh.
What If We Find The Guy Who Got Trapped In Here

When They Blew Up
The Original Theater?

What's That?

I Don't Like This.

I Don't Like This At All.
This Is Really Scary.

Come On, We Should
Just Go Back.

Come On! I Hate This.

Let's Get Out Of Here.
Let's Just Go! Come On!

Whoa!

Cool!

Look At This.

Wait!

What Are
You Doing?

Whoa! We're
Not Dead, Right?

What Are You
Talking About?

Long Tunnel,
Bright Light At The End.

I Just Wanted
To Make Sure.

Come On, Bri.
Let's Get Out Of Here, Please?

Not Till I Know
Where This Goes.


Oh! This Is So Frustrating!

I Call The Theater,
And All I Get

Is This Pre-Recorded
Laundry List Of Options,

None Of Which Lead
To A Human Being.

I Call The Box Office,
And All I Get Is Show Times.

Wait A Sec.
Does Your Beeper Have A Callback Function?

I Don't Know.

If Pete Called From The Lobby Earlier,

The Number Should
Still Be In Memory.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!

Here We Are.

[Telephone Rings]

City Morgue.

[Telephone Rings]

Hello?

On The Bench?

Oh, The Blue Bench.

Um, Hold--Hold On,
I'll Check.

Uh, It's--It's Empty.

Me? Oh, My Name.

I'm Mark Jefferies.

Oh, Hello, Mrs. Riley.

Um, No, I Haven't
Seen Pete.

You Want Me To--
To Find Out Where He Is?

Um, Ok, Could You--
Could You Hold On?

Ok, Um, Hold On.

Hmm!

Karen: Wow.

Brian: Ohh... Look
At All This.

Hmm. Yeah.

I Don't Get It.

Where'd All This Stuff
Come From?

Maybe Nobody
Knows About It.

Man, Some
Of This Old Stuff

Must Be Worth
A Fortune.

Bri, Are You Totally
100 % Positive

Mason Can't Possibly
Be The Phantom?

Of Course. Not Even
A Question.

Ok... Then...
What About This?

Whoa.

Hello, Children.

[Both Gasp]

Movie Mason

Oh Sorry I Startled You.

I See You've Discovered
M-Movie My Little Hideaway.

You--You Left
The Light On.

That's What Happens
With Old Age.

Liver Spots Come,
The Mind Goes.

Mason, Do You Know What's Been
Going On Around Here Tonight?

Crazy Projectors, Flashing Lights, Um,
Indoor Tornadoes?

It's Not You, Is It?

You're Not The Phantom
Of The Megaplex, Right?

Children...

Children...

Children...

When We Arrive In This World,
Magic Is All Around Us.

You Simply Have To See A Baby Discover A Butterfly

Or A Toddler Splash In The Bath For The First Time.

Yet, As The Years Pass,

Simple Pleasures Aren't Quite So Simple To Find.

Myths And Legends
Fall Away.

Santa's Secrets
Are Revealed,

Card Tricks Lose
Their Fascination.

True Wonder
Is Hard To Come By.

But There's Always...

Magic At The Movies.

Pirate Ships,
Bicycles That Fly,

Angels Earn Their Wings,

Beautiful Women
Marry Handsome Men,

And We All Learn...

There's No Place
Like Home.

To Destroy That Magic,
To Shatter Those Moments,

To Me
Is A Sin So Grave

As To Be Almost
Incomprehensible.

If There Truly Is A Phantom,
My Young Friends,

I Assure You...

It Most Definitely
Is Not Me.

[Both Sigh]

Has Anyone Seen Caitlin?
She's Supposed To Be

Hanging Around For The Premiere,
But I Can't Find Her.

I Don't Know If This Is A Sick Joke Or What,

But Shawn's
Gone Again.

And Nedermeyer
Just Called Again.

They Should Cancel
This Premiere.

Seriously! I Mean,
Once I Heard--

Terri! All Right, This Is The Biggest Thing
That's Ever Happened At The Grand.

No One's Gonna
Cancel It.

How're We Doing
On Clearing Out The Place?

You Mean Emptying
The Theaters?

Yeah.

Well, Lower Level's
Done.

This Level,<I>
Floodgate's Got 10 Minutes Left.

<I>Martian Mountain
Gets Out At 11:15.

Lacy's Checking
The Rest.

All Right, Well,
Go Check The Bathrooms.

All Right.

Woman: Oh...

Oh, Excuse Me,
Children.

Excuse Me, Will One
Of You Please Tell Me

Where I Might Find Your Manager, Um,
Shawn Macgibbon.

Um, Shawn?

Mm-Hmm.

Well, Um,
Shawn Could Be Just About Anywhere Right Now.

May I Help You?
I'm The Assistant Manager, Pete Riley.

And I, Child, Am Ms. Tory Hicks.
Perhaps You've Heard Of Me.

Perhaps Not. In Any Case,
I Have Ms. Madison Ashley Metz,

Mr. Jacob Johnson,
And Numerous Other Very Unhappy Clients

Outside In Their
Limousines,

Begging To Know
When We Will Be Getting

This Painfully Amateur
Show On The Road.

Soon, Really Soon,
We Promise.

Oh, It Had
Better Be Soon.

My Boy,
If I Don't Receive

A Personal Welcome
At My Limousine

From Your, Uh, Oh,
Shawn Macgibbon,

I Will Be Taking
All Of My Clients

Back To L.A. Before You Can Say "Heads Will Roll"!

Pleasure Meeting You,
Darling.


Do Give Your Manager
My Message, Hmm?

You Guys,
Pete, Hurry!

Donny Hollie's About To Pound The Life Out Of Ricky

Because Donny Pulled The
Laser Sword Out Of The Meteor

And Now He Wants
His Free Movie Passes,

But Nobody Can
Find Shawn,

And Ricky's Telling
Donny That...

You'll Get
Your Stupid Passes,

But I Can't Give
Them To You Tonight!

Then Let Me Stay For The Premiere.
She Gets To Stay.

Ricky: She And Lisa Have Tickets!

We're All Booked Out.
There Are No More Seats!

So, I'll Stand.

Hello! Fire Code Regulations.
Ever Heard Of Them?

We Overbook And Get
Totally Shut Down.

They Don't Care How Many Hollywood Stars Are Here.

They'll Cancel
The Whole Event!

How About You Leave,
And I'll Stay?

Pete: What Are You Doing, Donny?

You're Running A Contest.

I Won The Contest,
And I Want My Prize.

You'll Get Your Prize... Tomorrow,

But Right Now
You Gotta Leave.

Make Me.

[Fire Alarm Ringing]

[Woman Screams]

I Gotta Deal
With This, Donny,

Then I'll Be Back To Personally Toss You Out.

[Distant Screaming]

Folks, Please, If You
Would Just Listen To Me.

I Am Very,
Very Sorry The Fire Sprinklers Malfunctioned.

Uh, You're Welcome To Fill Out
Complaints Or Refund Forms,

But Please, Try And Understand,
I Have To Clear The Lobby.

We Have A Special Event
Starting In A Half An Hour,

And I Need
Your Full Cooperation.

Oh, Man. Mark, Take Over.

You Mean Me? Ahh...

All Right, Folks,
I'm Really, Really Sorry,

You're Gonna Have
To Clear, Please.

We Have This Really,
Really Big--Big Premiere Starting, I...

Pete: What Are You Doing Back?

Back? We Never Left.

What Happened
To Mom?

We Were Hoping You'd Tell Us.

She Hasn't
Shown Up Yet?

No, But The Good News Is,
We've I.D.Ed The Phantom.

It's Merle!

Why Would Merle
Be The Phantom?

Come On!
We'll Show You.

Brian: Remember What He Said
Up In The Projection Booth

About Being
Under-Appreciated,

Everything's Too Computerized,
All That Junk?

Pete: Uh-Huh.

Come On, Hurry,
Right This Way.

Well, Karen And Me Came In
Here Looking For You And--

What Happened To The Emergency Running Lights

Along The Floor?

Wait...


Announcer: It Started
As A Movie, But Now It's Real!

[Evil Laughter]

This Thing,
This Trailer,

It's Been Running Over
And Over In Here.

Who Else But Merle Could Rig Up Something Like This?

Who Else But Him Could Do Any Of It?

Brian Said The Lights And Projectors

Are Tied To The Computers Up There.

Yeah, But Merle's
Not Gonna Risk His Job

To Do Something Stupid Like This.
He's Been Here Forever.

Maybe That's
The Problem.

Maybe He
Finally Wants

To Be Appreciated
And Recognized.

Like Willie Gaines<I>
The Last Woodcarv?

In

Maybe You Two Guys Have
Seen Way Too Many Movies.


Announcer: Mischief...

On The Other Hand,
I Don't Think It Would Hurt To Check Merle Out.

Hey! What Are You Doing
It Sover There, Phantom?

Excuse Me?

I'm Really Sorry,
Merle.

My Slightly Demented Little
Brother Has Himself Convinced

You're The Phantom
Of The Megaplex.

Hey, Catch This.
He's Still Got

That Creepy Trailer
Playing Down There.

Uh, No, Actually,
I'm Workin' My Buns Off

Trying To Shut
The Darn Thing Down.

What's The Problem?
I Thought You Were

A Master At All
This Stuff.

Brian! You're Being Really Rude!
Now Will You Cool It?

The Fact Is,
I Don't Know How This Trailer Got Onto My Reels,

And I Can't Figure Out How It's
Programmed To Keep Repeating.

A Likely Story.

Listen, Kid. If You
Don't Back Off

And Give Me A Chance
To Sort This Out,

We're Not Gonna
Have A Premiere,

Because I Won't Be
Able To Run The Prints!

Which Conveniently Makes You Look Like A Big Hero

For Getting It
All Fixed In Time!

Karen And Pete: Brian!

Come On. We Got
Our Guy Right Here.

Why Don't You Two Wanna Do Anything About It?

Uh, Brian?

No, Listen To Me!

Brian, Look!

Whoa. He's...
Real.

Well, Duh.

Come On!

Ok, So, I Was Wrong.

Love To Stay And Help You Fix
The Computer And Everything,

But I'm Pretty Sure
Pete Needs Me More.

Karen: Yeah,
You Really Called It, Huh, Bri?

Yeah, It's Definitely Merle.

Great Job.
Nobody's Home.

Brian: I Don't See You Coming
Up With Any Brilliant Answers.

Uhh!

Pete: All Right,
I Surrender.

Maybe You Guys With All
Your Movie Knowledge

Do Know More
About This Than I Do.

So, How Are We Gonna Find Out
Who The Phantom Really Is?

Ok, We Need To Apply Cinematic Logic.

Is Anybody
Around This Place

Hooked Up
To The Internet?

It's A Major Megaplex About To Host A Major Premiere.

Wouldn't You Think That Somebody
Would Pick Up A Ringing Phone?

He Said He'll Be
Done In 5 Minutes.

George, You Don't Understand.
I'm Never Late.

Those Kids Must Think I'm In A Ditch Somewhere.

If They Were Worried,
Wouldn't They Have Beeped You?

You're Right,
They Must Be Dead.

Why Else Wouldn't I Have Heard From Them By Now?

I'm Really Trying
To Follow This.

You Need To Use
Shawn's Computer Why?

Listen, Everything The Phantom's Done So Far Tonight

Had To Do With The Movies Playing

In The Theaters
He's Attacked.

Now, If We Wanna
Know What He's

Got Planned
For The Premiere,

We've Gotta Find Out The Plot <I>Midnight Mayh.

Of

Ok, Nobody Knows That.
That's The Whole Deal.

I Mean,
They've Been Keeping The Story Top Secret.

Isn't He Cute
When He's Naive?

Ever Heard Of Spoiler Sites On The Internet?

Let Me Just Tell You,
A Movie Geek's Paradise.

Every Secret Hollywood Has,
These Guys Know.

Shawn?

[Door Creaks]

Whoa!
[Girls Scream]

Don't You Wish How All This Creepiness
Was Near The End, Sweetie?

It's Way Stressing Not Knowing Who's Doing It.


What The Heck
Was That?

It Came From
In There.

Hillary: Hello?

Is, Like, Anybody
In There?

It's
The Phantom.

What Do We Do?

I Don't Know!

Come Out Or We'll
Call The Police!

Both: Aah!

Please Don't
Call The Cops!

My Mom Would
So Ground Me.

I Didn't Even Want
To Stay! I Swear.

It Was All
April's Idea.

Relax. We Were Only Trying
To Crash The Premiere.

Well, You And Everybody
Else In Town.

But Without
A Ticket, No Go.

Told You, April.

I Came Up
To Call Nedermeyer,

I Was Jumped
From Behind... Again,

I Was Blindfolded, Handcuffed,
And Hung On The Door

Like A Bag
Of Dry Cleaning.

Well, If The Phantom's Not
Movie Mason And It's Not Merle,

Then We're Running
Out Of Suspects.

Here You All Are. Great.
Nedermeyer's Limo's On The Approach.

Ahem. Nedermeyer
Is To Know Nothing

Of Our Troubles
Here Tonight.

Are We Clear?

Yes, Sir.

Good. We Are Going To Act As If
Everything Is Absolutely Perfect,

While Praying That It
Actually Will Be.

Pete!

Uhh, Uhh!

This Way.

Ah, Mr. Nedermeyer!

Welcome, Welcome,
Welcome, Sir.

How Glorious To Have You Here This Evening,

Along With
Your Entourage.

And Mr. Tyler Jesseman.
I, Um...

What An Honor.

What A Thrill.
I--I Have Not Missed

A Single One
Of Your Films, Sir.

<I>Crow Catchers,
Dead And Gone-- Classics, Classics!

Hello, Lamonica.

Are You As Thrilled About This Evening As We Are, Sir?

All Preparations Proceeding Apace, Mcgreavey?

Macgibbon, Sir,
And Yes, They Are.

We Could Not Possibly
Have It More Under Control.

Lacy?

Lacy, No!


At The Big Climax,
The Mayhem Monster

Traps A Bunch Of Kids
In The School Auditorium,

Then Starts
Growing So Big

He Completely Sucks
The Air Out Of The Place.

Oh, Yeah,
That Should Be

Real Easy For Our
Phantom To Pull Off.

Well, You Know He's Gonna Try Something Like It.

Come On.
Let's Go Warn Pete.

Wait Your Turn!

Sorry, Sir.

All Right,
Maccarthy...

Macgibbon.

Since You Don't
Have Any Answers

As To Why Our Balloons
Became Water Balloons,

Perhaps You Can
Answer This.

Who Told You To Remove

The Incredibly Expensive
Mayhem Monster From My Roof?

I Didn't
Remove It, Sir.

It's Up
There... Still.

Exactly The Way You Wanted It To Be.

And I'm Telling You,
That 10 Minutes Ago

When I Came In,
It Wasn't There!

Pardon Me!

Lamonica:
Whoa!

Ah, Wolfgang.
I Am Simply Stopping In To Say Good-Bye.

Ms. Tory Hicks!

The Woman Who Brought The Tinsel To Tinseltown.

Of Course You Know
Tyler Jesseman.

Yes.

Good-Bye? What Do
You Mean, Good-Bye?

Just Because I Call
My People Cattle

Does Not Mean They
Can Be Treated As Such.

We've Been Outside
Cooling Our Heels

In The Limos
For 3 Quarters Of An Hour.

Are You Opening
These Doors Or Aren't You?

All Right, Mcgreavey. You Heard Ms. Hicks.
Open Those Doors Now!

I'll See If I Can Find Out What
Happened To That Monster.

Â™ª Hooray For Hollywood â™ª

â™ª That Phony,
Super Coney, Hollywood â™ª

â™ª They Come From Chilicothes
And Padukahs â™ª

â™ª With Their Bazookas

â™ª To Get Their Name Up
In Lights â™ª

â™ª Hooray For Hollywood

â™ª You May Be Homely
In Your Neighborhood â™ª

â™ª But If You Think
That You Can Be An Actor â™ª

â™ª See Mr. Factor

â™ª He'd Make A Monkey
Look Good â™ª

â™ª Within A Half An Hour

â™ª You'll Look Like
Tyrone Power â™ª

â™ª Hooray For Hollywood â™ª

What Are You Doing?

Entertaining Your Neglected Guests.

Listen Here, You Freakshow,
I Could Have Sworn

I Told You To Keep Away
From Here This Evening.

Is There A Problem?

Stay Out
Of This, Lady.

Crowd: Ooh!

Reporter: Ms. Ashley Metz!

Second Reporter: Ashley,
Over Here, Ashley!

Crowd: Ohh!

I--It's--You're,
Um, You're Her.

Can I Introduce
My Friend To You,

Ms. Madison
Ashley Metz?

Oh... You--You Two...

What, You--You
Know Each Other?

This Is
Her Hometown.

She Virtually Grew Up In This Theater.

In Fact, Movie Mason
Was The Very First One

Who Encouraged Me
To Become An Actress.

Oh...

Swell. I, Uh, I--

If You'd Be A Sweetie
And Open The Doors,

My Escort And I
Are More Than Ready

To Go In
And Take Our Seats.

Reporters: Ashley! Ashley!

Excuse Me.
I Know That My Timing Couldn't Be Worse.

Um, I'm Pete Riley's Mom,
And I Don't Want To Get In

To See The Premiere,
I Really Don't.

I Just Desperately Need To Find My Kids.

Pete!

We've Been Looking
Everywhere For You.

Brian Found Out
The

<I>Midnight May Climax.

Well, Guess What?
Now The Giant Monster Balloon,

The One From The Roof?

It's Gone And Nobody Can
Find The Roof Level Key.

Wait A Minute!

Could This Be It?

Karen: Why Would Anyone Steal A
Balloon That's Bigger Than A House?

Where Would You
Hide It?

What Would You
Do With It?

Yeah, Well,
They Totally

Had To Let The Air Out Of It

To Get It Down
From Here.

You Know, Guys,
I'm Really Sorry

I Haven't Taken Your Opinions More Seriously Tonight.

Tonight?
You Never Do.

Ok, Well, Maybe I've Just Been So
Wrapped Up With Work And Stuff

That I Haven't Bothered To Notice
That You Two Are Growing Up To Be--

Incredibly Intelligent?

Amazingly
Good-Looking?

A Pretty Impressive Team.

I Hate To Say This,
But I Probably Could Learn A Few Things

From Hanging Out
With You Guys.

Well, Duh.
We're The Funnest People You Know.

Aw, Come Here.

[Evil Laughter]

Pete: Ohh!

Brian: Aah!

Karen: What's Going On?
Ow! What's Happening?

Hey, Ouch!

What's That?

Watch It!

Pete?

[Evil Laughter]

What's Going On?

Who's There?

What's Going On?

Ow!

What's Happening?

[Evil Laughter]

Uh, Guys What Just
Happened?

I'm Betting We've Been
Phatomized

Great. I've Seen Katey Segal,
I've Seen Levar Burton,

But I Haven't Spotted A Single One Of My Own Kids.

Oh, Wait,
There's Somebody Who Might Be Able To Help.

Hillary,
Hillary.

Hi, Julie Riley,
Pete's Mom.

How Are You, Mrs. R?
I Didn't Know You Were Coming Tonight.

Yeah, Well,
Neither Did I.

Listen, I'm Looking For Pete's Little Brother And Sister.

You Wouldn't Happen To Know Where They Might Be?

The Way Things Have Been
Going Around Here Tonight,

I Couldn't Even
Begin To Guess.

Ok.

Pete: We Have To Shuffle
An Inch At A Time

Until One Of Us Hits That, Uh,
The Pipe With The Valve.

Karen: How Do We Know We
Don't Shuffle Right Off The Roof?

Don't Worry.
There Are Guard Rails.

Brian: Ok. I Get That We're
Looking For This Valve.

Now Explain To Me What Happens Once We Find It.

Look, You Think You Two
Are The Only Movie Buffs?

This Is Like James Raymond
In

<I>Huey's Cove.

Oh, Yeah, Exactly!
He's Trapped In The Fisherman's Net

But Gets Himself
To The Coral Reef.

And Uses It
To Open The Net.

Ok. We've Gotta Move Right
To Get To The Pipe.

Over... Over... Over.

Wait A Minute--


Where Is It?
Where's The Valve?

Brian, Get Your Elbow
Out Of--Oh, Wait!

I Found Them!
I Found The Valve. Ok, Guys.

We're Gonna Drop
Right Now. Ok...

All: Whoa!

Folks! Ahem!

Ladies And Gentlemen,

Could You Take
Your Seats, Please?

Thanks. Everybody,
Uh, Take Your Seats.

I Would Like
To Welcome You

To What I Know Will Be An
Enjoyable And Exciting Event.

Since We're All
Anxious To Start,

Let Me Introduce
The Director Of Our Film,

Mr. Tyler Jesseman!

Ooh!

Uh... Ha Ha.

Thank You Very, Very,
Very, Very Much

For Being Here.

I Know That Some Of You Have
Traveled A Long Way To Do So.

Um... The Hour Is Late,

So Without Further Ado,

Let The Mayhem Begin!


[All Screaming]

No!

Aah!

Man: Go This Way!
Let's Go This Way!

Take Hold
Of My Hand!

Go Get The Driver!
Enough Is Enough!

Man, Is This
Getting Old!

Brian, Get Your Elbow
Out Of My Back!

It's Not Me!

Karen--

Sorry!

Where Is It?
Where's The Valve?

Looking For The--
Wait. Is That It?

Yes! That's It!

This Way! This Way!

Aah!

Oh!

Down A Little!
Down A Little!

Ok.

Ok, I Almost Got It.
Almost Got It. I Got It!

I Got It. All Right,
Come On.

Nice Job, Pete.

Thanks.
But We've Still Got To Head Off The Phantom's Finale.

You're Positive
It's Him?

You're The Ones
With All The Clues.

I Just Added Them
Up.

They've Already Gotten
To The Scary Parts!

Man, This Movie
Must Rock!

What Do We Do?
It's Blocked!

All Right, Let's Go.
You Want To Solve A Problem,

You Gotta Get Some Perspective On It.

Yeah, Hurry!

[People
Yelling]

Help Us!

Whoa!

Holy Schnitzel!

What Are We
Supposed To Do Now?!

May I Offer A Suggestion?

Mason! Where Did
You Come From?

I Left Miss Metz To Use The Rest Room,
And All Heck Broke Loose.

If You're Willing To Take Advice From An Old-Timer,

We Might Just Be Able
To Save The Day!

It Won't Come Out,
Mason.

Keep At It, Lad!

Riley, What Are You
Doing?

I'm Trying To Pull
This Thing Out.

But You Know That Only
Happens Every 10,000 Tugs,

And Stupid Donny Hollie
Had It Out An Hour Ago.

Yeah, Well,
You Can Keep Pulling Till Your Arms Fall Off...

Or You Can Do This.

Thanks, Bro.
Mason, Let's Go.

Aah!

Aah!

Where Do You Suppose The Kids Are In All This?

There's One Of Them!

Geronimo!

[Air Hisses]



Pete!

Look!

You Go Take Care
Of That Monkey.

Hoo Hoo Hah Hah!

Crowd: Oh!

Crowd: Whoa!

Ah!

Oh!

Whoa!

[Crowd Gasps]
Ohh!

The Only Reason I'm Not Arresting
You For Malicious Mischief

Is Because I Still Have A Premiere To Get Under Way.

But Mark My Words--

I Intend To Ensure That Your Life Becomes As Miserable

As You've Made Mine
Tonight.

Not Only Are You Fired And Banned
From These Premises For Life,

But I'll Ensure That You
Never Again Work

In Any Theater In Any City In This State!

Is That Clear, Mcnall?

Macgibbon.

Macgibbon! For Once In Your Life,
Get It Right!

My Name Is--Ding!

Shawn Macgibbon,

And I Did All This Tonight Just
So You Would Finally Notice Me!

But You Don't Care.

You've Never Cared.
Ha Ha!

You Think Lamonica Will Be A Better Gm Than I Will?

So Be It.
But Don't Come Crying To Me

When You Find Out
That You're Wrong!

Mr. Macgibbon!

You Know What I Was Saying Up On The Roof

About Lightening
Up A Little?

That's A Good Thing,
Right?

Yes!

Yes!

I'm 17, Not 70.

I Mean,
Aren't I Supposed To Be Enjoying Myself?

Totally!

And I Know The Perfect
Way For You To Start.

You Can Talk Mom Into Letting Karen
And Me Stay For The Premiere.

Will You, Pete?
Please?

Please?

Please?

Please?

I'm Telling You,
It'll Write Itself:

<I>Phantom Of The Megaplex:

<I>The Shawn Macgibbon Story.

You'll Come To L.A.
We'll Be Partners.

You Mean It?

Of Course I Do!

And Do Me A Favor,
Partner.

Run And Fetch Me A Hot Cup Of Coffee,
2 Creams.

I'll Meet You In The Show.
I Love Ya! [Chuckles]


All We Need Now Is A 4-Star Hollywood Ending.


All Right.

How 'Bout This?

Just Because A Plant
Is Healthy,

Alone In Its Pot,

That Doesn't Mean It's Entirely Happy.

Julie...

If You'll Have Me,

I Would Really Love
To Become A Part

Of This
Amazing Family.

I--Unfortunately,
I, Uh,

Don't Have A Ring Yet--

Pardon Me, Sir.
May I Offer You This Loaner?

Ha Ha Ha Ha!
Ha Ha Ha Ha...

I Have A Lot Of Props
Around

Just In Case
Of Emergencies.

Julie...

Will You Marry Me?

How Can I Resist?

[Crowd Cheers]

Ah, Mr. Riley,

Now...

With Shawn Gone And Lamonica Moving Up,

I'm Going To Need A New Senior Manager.

Money, Money.
Longer Hours.

What Do You Say?

Absolutely, Sir.
I'd Be Honored.

But, Uh...

I'm Afraid I Have
To Turn You Down.

Excuse Me?

I'm Sorry.
I Guess What I Figured Out Tonight

Is That I Need To Spend More Time Having A Life.

In Fact, Mr. Nedermeyer,

I'd, Uh... Really Like
The Rest Of The Night Off.

I Think I Deserve It.

Oh, You Do, Do You?

Good! Because
I Think So, Too.


Here.
Take Your Girl Out To A Lovely Breakfast

After The Picture--
On Me.

You Saved My Skin
Tonight, Riley.

I Appreciate It.

All Right, Everybody,
Let's Go In

And Enjoy The Show!

Oh, Lamonica!
Yes, We're Gonna Use Theater 2.

I Want You To Run Up
To The Projection Booth

And Tell Merle.

Ok!

Not That I'm...
In Over My Head Here,

But, Uh...
Where The Devil Is The Projection Booth?

Ok, Littles.
Say Good Night To Your Brother.

It's Time To Hit
The Road.

Uh, Actually, Mom,
I Was Thinking

It Might Be Really Nice If You Let Brian And Karen

Stay For The Premiere.

I Know It's Late,
But It's Summer.

Tomorrow They Can Sleep In As Long As They Need To.

Besides...

If It Wasn't For
Their Detective Work,

We Probably Wouldn't
Even Have A Premiere.

What Do You Say?

Please?

Yeah, Come On, Mom. Please?

Tch. Oh...

You're Not Afraid They're Gonna Cramp Your Style?

Are You Kidding?
We're Teaching Him Style!

Oh!

Sad But True.

Admit It, Mom.
We All Really Need To Be Together Tonight.

And What Better Place
For Us Than The Movies?

He Does Have
A Point, Hon.

All Right, All Right,
All Right.

We Can Stay?

Yes! Come On.

Yes!

Enjoy The Show, Sir.

You Enjoy The Show.

Enjoy The Show!

Ha Ha Ha!

Enjoy The Show.

You Know,
As Long As I've Been Around This Place,

I Never Really Believed In The
Phantom Of The Megaplex.

Now, The Werewolf
Of The Megaplex...


That's A Different
Story Entirely!

[Wolf Howls]

[Awoo Awoo Awoo]
