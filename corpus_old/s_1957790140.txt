<i>[WOMAN] Here you go.</i>

<i>Here you go.</i>

<i>- [FOLDERS THUD]
All yours, Sofia.</i>

<i>- Sorry, what am I supposed to...
Not my problem.</i>

<i>Mm.</i>

<i>[MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>[SIGHS SADLY]</i>

<i>Miss Dunham.</i>

<i>Oh, Sofia. Wonderful.</i>

<i>Can you get me anÂ espresso
before I pass out</i>

<i>looking at the god-awful logos
that corporate sent over?</i>

<i>I don't know why
they insist on doing my job for me.</i>

<i>There's not a creative mind
in the entire bunch.</i>

<i>Yeah. Yeah, Miss... Uh, yeah,
I can do that for you. Um...</i>

<i>Before I do that, I...
I was also wondering, uh...</i>

<i>[SPUTTERING] I... I thought that I...</i>

<i>- I thought that...
Oh my God, spit it out.</i>

<i>So, I've been your assistant
for, like, two years now?</i>

<i>Or a little over two years, and, um,</i>

<i>I just thought it was time
to talk about, you know, the fa...</i>

<i>the fact that my job
is, um, answering phones</i>

<i>and proofing and scheduling,</i>

<i>and I don't actually get
to do any graphic design.</i>

<i>[SIGHS] I hired you to be my assistant,</i>

<i>not my protÃ©gÃ©.</i>

<i>And I thought you understood that
when you took the job.</i>

<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. Uh...
I just thought that if I could show you</i>

<i>that I could handle more responsibility
then something might fall to me.</i>

<i>There's an entire office
full of peopleÂ with master's degrees</i>

<i>waiting for something to open up for them.</i>

<i>So I don't think anything is going
to fall to one of my assistants.</i>

<i>Yeah, okay, uh...</i>

<i>So, what do I do?</i>

<i>[SIGHS]</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>Oh, love.</i>

<i>I'm gonna do you a favor.</i>

<i>Thank you. Oh, wow.
I really appreciate it.</i>

<i>I'm gonna let you go.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>Sorry, what?</i>

<i>Yeah, two years is way too long
to be somebody's assistant.</i>

<i>Most people leave the job
after six months.</i>

<i>How old are you?</i>

<i>I turn 30 tomorrow.</i>

<i>Ew. You are way too old
to be answering phones.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] You know,
there's something for you out there,</i>

<i>but it's not here.</i>

<i>So, I'm going to ask you to reconsider.
I don't think you...</i>

<i>[KNOCKS ON DESK] Yeah, I'm ready.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>It's apple juice, honey.
It's your favorite.</i>

<i>[ZOOEY] I don't like it.</i>

<i>[WOMAN] Oh.</i>

<i>Well, yesterday,
you really liked apple juice.</i>

<i>All right, well, I think
it's nap timeÂ when we get home</i>

Mm?</i>

You got a big day ahead of you.</i>

<i>No, I don't remember

<i>You know, you've been

<i>Mom, the doctor, I think, is gonna have

<i>I told all the girls that you're in town,

Honey.</i>

<i>And we thought, what's more romantic...</i>

<i>Maybe get to know

<i>No dying here, please.
Only cooking. [LAUGHS]</i>

<i>Well, we have lots to do so, um...</i>

<i>As you know, uh, I am Guillermo

<i>But now he gets to learn from the best.</i>

<i>His tÃ­o Guillermo.</i>

<i>[LAUGHS]</i>

<i>Nice to meet you all, um,</i>

<i>officially.</i>

<i>- [CLEARS THROAT]
Hi.</i>

<i>So, we will be making
delicious dishes for the summer</i>

<i>leading all the way up
to La Noche de San Juan.</i>

<i>This is the celebration
of the summer solstice,</i>

<i>the longest day of the year.</i>

<i>This is when, um, friends and loved ones,</i>

<i>they gather on the beaches
of Spain with big fires</i>

<i>to welcome the arrival of summer.</i>

<i>- Oh, how lovely.
That's lovely.</i>

<i>- Oh! Jinx!
[ALL LAUGH]</i>

<i>And, uh, today we will start</i>

<i>with, uh, one of the most popular dishes
in Spain, the tortilla EspaÃ±ola.</i>

<i>What you call theÂ Spanish omelet.</i>

<i>- [LAINIE] Ooh!
Ah?</i>

<i>Oh. [CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>- Egg.
[GUILLERMO] Ah, huevos.</i>

<i>- Muy bien.
Thank you, huevos.</i>

<i>- So fun, so fun.
Oh, yeah, eggs.</i>

<i>Cut your potatoes into quarters</i>

<i>and thenÂ you slice them
into little triangles.</i>

<i>[INTRIGUING CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>Watch your fingers, honey.</i>

<i>You watch yourself
while I'm holdingÂ this knife.</i>

<i>- Oh.
[BOTH LAUGH]</i>

<i>They should be about this thick
for the best taste.</i>

<i>How's Sofia doing?</i>

<i>Yeah, those look, uh, very good actually.</i>

<i>Uh, lucky you do not need
to use your foot for this, huh?</i>

<i>[LAUGHING]</i>

<i>[TODD] He's so cute.</i>

<i>And then you sprinkle
a little truffle salt on your potatoes</i>

<i>once they are cut.</i>

<i>Kerala, those look wonderful.</i>

<i>- Thanks, Guillermo.
I... I put the salt on.</i>

<i>[GUILLERMO] Oh! Well...</i>

<i>[BRITTANY] Hey, cut it out.</i>

<i>[KERALA] That's a no-no.</i>

<i>- [GASPS SOFTLY] Oh!
No. It's not gonna last.</i>

<i>[PAN SIZZLING]</i>

<i>[GUILLERMO] Keep on beating them
until they are good and mixed.</i>

<i>Take out all of yourÂ frustrations
out on those eggs, huh?</i>

<i>This is gonna be a killer omelet.</i>

<i>Oh. You seem very, uh, angry
at those eggs.</i>

<i>[LAINIE CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>Yeah, I've got, like,
a lot of frustration to take out.</i>

<i>So, just...</i>

<i>- Okay.
Yeah.</i>

<i>Seems healthy. Safe. Yeah.</i>

<i>- What? Stop.
What? What?</i>

<i>- Focus on your potatoes.
[MATIAS] Very mediocre. Good job.</i>

<i>Now, this is the fun part.</i>

<i>You will take your tortilla flipper,</i>

<i>or a plate or a lid</i>

<i>if you are not from Spain
and do not have a tortilla flipper,</i>

<i>and you willÂ cover the pan. Mm?</i>

<i>And then you will flip
your tortilla quickly, like so.</i>

<i>Eh?</i>

<i>Oh, just like that, huh?</i>

<i>- Oh, you can do this!Â I promise.
[TODD] All right, all right.</i>

<i>- [EXCLAIMS]
[GUILLERMO] Yes!</i>

<i>- [LAUGHS]
Okay.</i>

<i>[GUILLERMO LAUGHS]</i>

<i>- [SOFIA] And then...
[GUILLERMO] Yeah!</i>

<i>- That's not terrible.
Oh!</i>

<i>- I'm a chef! [LAUGHS]
Right? We made it.</i>

<i>Now what? Now what?</i>

<i>Uh, you just put it back in the pan
and, uh, you cook the other side.</i>

<i>- [SOFIA] Slide it?
[LAINIE] Yeah, slide it.</i>

<i>Oh, a little of that.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] Yes!</i>

<i>- Okay. Oh, we got a runner!
[SOFIA] Oh, shoot!</i>

<i>- Sorry, sorry. Get right there.
It's okay. See, look.</i>

<i>No, no. Oh, it's okay. There. No worries.</i>

<i>- So exciting.
There, good as new, okay?</i>

<i>- Okay, okay. We can take it from here.
Okay. Of course.</i>

<i>- Thank you.
Thanks.</i>

<i>Make sure it's nice and round.</i>

<i>Matias, is this... is this a problem?</i>

<i>That can be saved.</i>

<i>- Oh, yay. Okay.
Oh, good.</i>

<i>Be nice.</i>

<i>I am being nice.
You be less nice. How about that?</i>

<i>Double flip.</i>

<i>[ALL EXCLAIM]</i>

<i>And now for the best part.
We get to eat what we have made.</i>

<i>[LAUGHING]</i>

<i>And you can put a little, uh,
salt and pepper on it, if you like.</i>

<i>- [LAINIE] Okay. Looks great.
Bit of salt.</i>

<i>I like more truffle salt. [LAUGHS]</i>

<i>Oh my God. Oh my God, this is fantastic.</i>

<i>Guillermo, I love it.</i>

<i>[LAUGHS] So wonderful.</i>

<i>Uh, this is the perfect dish
for any tapas party,</i>

<i>and you should not have one without it.</i>

<i>That's true, that's true.</i>

<i>[LAINIE] Oh, God, well, I... I love it.</i>

<i>It's not not good.</i>

<i>"Not not good." Ooh, and the onions...</i>

<i>- It's actually...
Truffle salt.</i>

<i>- It's the truffle salt.
Okay, I'm good after this.</i>

{\an8}<i>That was fun.
I know I had a really good time.</i>

<i>- We'll see you all next week, yes? Yes.
Oh, you can count on it!</i>

<i>- [GUILLERMO CHUCKLES] Thank you.
That was fun. Bye!</i>

<i>- Oh, bye. Nice meeting you.
Good night.</i>

<i>- This was better.
Uh, thank you.</i>

<i>- Okay.
Bye.</i>

<i>Bye, see you.</i>

<i>[MATIAS] Bye. Thank you, man.
[EXCLAIMS REPEATEDLY] No, look.</i>

<i>When you cook at home,Â you clean up.</i>

<i>But when you cook here,
we clean up. Right, TÃ­o?</i>

<i>- [LAUGHS]
Que claro.</i>

<i>- Oh, I love the sound of that.
Yeah, you do.</i>

<i>- Yes.
Ah.</i>

<i>- Oh, I can...
Here.</i>

<i>No, but would youÂ be needing help,
uh, to your... to your car?</i>

<i>No, my mom and I have got it.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] Yeah. I'll be outside.</i>

<i>I...</i>

<i>Uh, let me help. This... here.</i>

<i>- No, no, no, I... I can grab...
No, it's okay. I can help, it's okay.</i>

<i>No, it's nothing. Don't worry, no trouble.</i>

<i>- Thank you.
Hey, de nada. Yeah.</i>

<i>- Then let... I can carry.
I can grab it.</i>

<i>It's okay. It's... Please. Oh.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>So did you enjoy the class?</i>

<i>- Honestly, not really, no.
Why not?</i>

<i>'Cause I just spent an hour
making eggs and potatoes.</i>

<i>Yeah, but that is just the basics.</i>

<i>It's... It's the personal touches,
the flavor, that make it, um, special.</i>

<i>- Mm.
You know, like my uncle's truffle salt.</i>

<i>Which, between you and me,
is always the secret ingredient.</i>

<i>Well, between you and me,
it's a pretty simple dish.</i>

<i>Yeah, well, many of the old recipes
began with the simplest of ingredients</i>

<i>because it was all that people
could afford at the time.</i>

<i>It's not exactly fine dining, is it?</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] N... No.</i>

<i>No, it's... it's traditional dining,</i>

<i>which is, uh, in many ways, harder</i>

<i>than having everything you want
to make a dish.</i>

<i>I don't know,
I think IHOP kind of crushes it</i>

<i>with theÂ Rooty Tooty
Fresh 'n Fruity breakfast.</i>

<i>Is that fine dining?</i>

<i>No, but it gets the job done.</i>

<i>Yeah, of c... Eating is not a job.</i>

<i>Eating is one
of life'sÂ greatest pleasures, you know?</i>

<i>Yeah, sometimes it's life's only pleasure.</i>

<i>What... What... What does that mean?</i>

<i>I think I hear my mom calling me.</i>

<i>- Really?
Yeah.</i>

<i>- Do you wanna follow me to the car?
Yes, of course.</i>

<i>- Or should I hobble with the box in hand?
No, no, I will help you.</i>

<i>So, uh, you will be back
next week though, yes?</i>

<i>- Oh, yes. Oh, we'll be back.
I...</i>

<i>- Okay, okay.
You can count on that.</i>

<i>I guess we will.</i>

<i>Uh, just, um, promise me,
between now and then,</i>

<i>no, uh, Rooty Tooty-whatever.</i>

<i>That's not the message I was getting.</i>

<i>- Trust me.
You know I'm dating Irina.</i>

<i>Oh! Irina. Yeah, she's dating you.</i>

<i>Go out with the American girl.</i>

<i>Viviana, leave your cousin alone.</i>

<i>Spanish men are players, Mom.
Everybody knows that.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] No, I didn't get...
I didn't get a player vibe.</i>

<i>Mm-hmm, and that's

<i>Look, you... you take all the ingredients

<i>and then all the flavors

<i>No. Because in design,

recipes come from?Â From the stars?</i>

<i>It meant that something

<i>I was being stupid.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>So, what? You want me to just forgive you?</i>

<i>I just want you to know that I realize

<i>And I truly am sorry.</i>

Wait, wait. You didn't quit your job.</i>

<i>- Did you?
Ish.</i>

<i>Oh. Quit-ish.</i>

<i>Yeah, just like you dumped-ish Richard
after he cheated on you?</i>

<i>- Ish.
[SCOFFS]</i>

<i>Sofia, honey,
you didn't make those decisions.</i>

<i>They were made for you.</i>

<i>Now, you keep letting yourself stay
in these horrible situations</i>

<i>and then you lose a piece of yourself.</i>

<i>And if you get back with Richard,</i>

<i>he's going to be making
that decision for you too.</i>

<i>Because that's what he wants.</i>

So, he's on lunch shift today.</i>

<i>Oh, okay. That doesn't sound that bad.

<i>[VIVIANA SIGHS]</i>

<i>- What?
We miss you.</i>

<i>- I missed you too, but you guys had Irina.
[SIGHS]</i>

<i>Oh, Irina. She was a nightmare.</i>

<i>All she wanted to do was be pampered and...</i>

<i>God, I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>You know.
Well, she and Matias are no more.</i>

<i>Really?</i>

<i>He told her he was done
being her puppy dog.</i>

<i>Oh. How'd she take that?</i>

<i>Well, have you seen
a wild boar devour a small reptile?</i>

<i>Not that specific combination, no.</i>

<i>- I have.
Oh, no.</i>

<i>[BOTH LAUGH]</i>

<i>He said that you helped him see
how foolish he was to stay with her.</i>

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>I did that, huh?</i>

<i>And I, for one,
am so thankful that you did.</i>

<i>Uh, hey, where is he?</i>

<i>He, uh... He's leaving today for Barcelona.</i>

<i>No, I thought he was staying
through the weekend.</i>

<i>He moved his flight up a few days</i>

<i>because he wanted
to get settled for the new job.</i>

<i>Okay, okay. Um, do you think
I can still catch him?</i>

<i>[LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>- We can try.
Yeah?</i>

<i>- We need to try. Where? Uh, where? Okay!
[LAUGHS]</i>

<i>[VIVIANA] Let's check
his apartment first, no?</i>

<i>Yeah, his apartment.</i>

<i>We can try and catch him at the airport.</i>

<i>Vi, you really don't
have to do thisÂ for me. It's okay.</i>

<i>Of course I do. You're family.</i>

<i>- I love you.
[BOTH LAUGH]</i>

<i>[PANTING] Okay, so I... I can drive.</i>

<i>Okay, uh, I should
let my mom know that... that we're...</i>

<i>We need to hurry.</i>

<i>Okay. Yeah.
No, she'll be fine. I'll be fine.</i>

<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

<i>- [GROANS] Just...
Jeez!</i>

<i>Uh, okay. Are you... Where are you gonna...</i>

<i>- Go, go! Go find him.
Okay.</i>

<i>All right. I'llÂ come... I'll come find you.</i>

<i>I'll look for you.
I'll look for you. Thanks!</i>

<i>- [GROANS] Ooh! I'm sorry. Sorry!
Scusi.</i>

<i>[LIVELY MUSIC CONTINUES]</i>

<i>Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.</i>

<i>[MUSIC FADES]</i>

<i>[MATIAS] Sofia?</i>

<i>[TENDER MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] Hi.</i>

<i>Oh my God, you're still here.</i>

<i>Oh. I thought you left.</i>

<i>No, I... I, uh...</i>

<i>I couldn't leave
before trying chicken fingers.</i>

<i>Chicken fingers.</i>

<i>I like it.</i>

<i>[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]</i>

<i>You know, I don't know
how you do things in Spain,</i>

<i>but here in America we actually say
goodbye to people before we leave.</i>

<i>Yes, um...</i>

<i>I wanted to, but...</i>

<i>you're a very...</i>

<i>strong person.</i>

<i>Wow, no one's ever
accused me of that before.</i>

<i>You knew what you wanted, so...</i>

<i>I thought I should respect your wishes.</i>

<i>Well, then,
I guess this is a goodbye present.</i>

<i>What is this?</i>

<i>- This is a Cabernet Sauvignon.
[CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>It's the pride and joy of Sonoma County.</i>

<i>- Yeah, I have heard of this. [LAUGHS]
Oh, yeah? [CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>I was...</i>

<i>hoping that we could drink it together.</i>

<i>To celebrate.</i>

<i>To celebrate... what?</i>

<i>I got accepted into a master's program
for graphic design.</i>

<i>I start in August.</i>

<i>- Sofia, this... this is amazing!
Yeah.</i>

<i>- Felicitaciones,</i> mama.</i>
[LAUGHS] Thank you, thank you.</i>

<i>- I'm assuming that that means congrats?
Yes, yes.</i>

<i>Oh, I'm getting so good at Spanish.</i>

<i>Which, actually, will come in handy
when I start school.</i>

<i>Why is that?</i>

<i>Because I'm going to be
at the Institute of Design</i>

<i>in Madrid.</i>

<i>Wait. [LAUGHS]
That's the... No, that... that...</i>

<i>There's not one of those
in Santa Clara or whatever, right?</i>

<i>No, no. Just the one in EspaÃ±a.</i>

<i>That's amazing, mama.</i>

<i>[BOTH LAUGH]</i>

<i>Mm, thank you.</i>

<i>Perhaps, maybe you will let me
come and, um, visit you sometimes</i>

<i>while you are there.</i>

<i>I think I'll have to sign up
for everyÂ single one of Matias' tours...</i>

<i>that Matias' Tours has available.</i>

<i>I wish you didn't have to go.</i>

<i>Uh...</i>

<i>I can't...</i>

<i>leave now.</i>

<i>I have to try the pairing
of chicken fingers and this wine.</i>

<i>[LAUGHS] Come here.</i>

<i>[ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>- No, it's... I have... It's an emergency.
Move the car, lady.</i>

<i>No! No, no, no, no! This is an emergency.</i>

<i>- I'm gonna move the car, they're...
I don't care. Get!</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>Did you miss your flight?</i>

<i>- [VIVIANA CHUCKLES]
Yeah, just barely.</i>
