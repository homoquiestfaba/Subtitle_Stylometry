<i>The madness...

<i>
is a disease that spreads through the mind.

<i>Generating and disturbed twisted thoughts...

<i>
Pushing us to commit horrendous acts...

<i>that transcend the usual
imagining sphere.

<i>Moves from one person to another...

<i>
without distinction of sex, race, age or creed.

<i>
Giving rise to unimaginable results...

<i>
we are unable to accept nor understand.

<i>We can only attempt,
perhaps in some way...

<i>contain these insane poor...

<i>
helpless wandering through the narrow limits...

<i>of their inner worlds.

<i>My name is Dr. Henry Stenson.

Welcome to the madhouse.

Give it.

<i>Patient 49.

<i>
came recently with a very tragic story...

<i>
after losing everything that has ever loved.

<i>Art is a very subjective means.

<i>We see what we want to see...

<i>in a painting, a book,
a sculpture or a figure.

My friends told me.
Everything happened in your head.

This is not true, not true.
No, Matthew, is absolutely true.

<i>
The police never could figure out what happened.

<i>And soon after, the boy
was brought to the asylum.

<i>Of course, one can only imagine what happens
...

<i>in the fragile head of an eight
years exposed to such horrific traumas.

<i>Worlds are created.

<i>The mind does everything necessary to protect...

<i>such terrible experiences.

<i>
The mind is incredibly tough.

<i>
can create worlds of fantasy...

<i>to protect us from reality
and blind us to the truth.

<i>The worse the truth, the greater
fantasy.

<i>On the other hand, fantasy
can also be more real...

<i>than we could ever imagine
.

<i>Most of his days were passed

Matthew, chapter 24...

<i>
The sounds were very clear last night.

<i>The din was repeated,
but hardly open my eyes...

<i>sounds begin.

<i>I think I can be suffering from a neurological syndrome
high pressure.

Are you trying to fool?

Who laughs now?

<i>The word designates a planet Nibiru

The Twelfth Planet.

In the writings of Dr. Sitchin
about Nibiru, Planet X...

the Annunaki

.

An alien race,

more than 300,000 years ago.

<i>Many researchers, including myself...

<i>Wave time zero.

At the end of time...

the ebb and flow of novelty

attraction of the teleological end of the universe.

Can also refer
to this as the "black path".

Possibly...

Could this be the true
wave zero time?

The change in position of the zodiac...

is causally associated with the astral
location mapping.

Basta.

It's hard, I know.

Sometimes these things
pile into my head...

and there are many who suddenly
cease to make sense.

Allison, I wish you were here
.

I just want to hear.

<i>James.

James, please listen to me.

Not want to know any of this.

I just want my husband back.

Or maybe...


I can no longer sleep.

Sounds...

seem to be increasing.

I'm starting to hallucinate again...

and I can be in the final stages of
high pressure neurological syndrome.

Yesterday...

Basta!

<i>You have to listen.

Your lies?

This is all in my head.

This is not real.

<i>Calm down, James.
Do not be afraid.

What calms me?
Would you calm down?

My wife is not here because he died

I heard bombs.
I know they arrived.

I know.

abducted at age 13...

aliens to implant communication devices.

Lenny Captain Hammer,
member of Majestic 12 disappears.

The Mayans did not predict anything,
were giving us a message.

But we destroyed almost everything, so it was incomprehensible
...

and so the Earth was destroyed.

We did not understand the message.

And now...

am the only one left.

I'm the only one who has some idea how to stop
...

how to keep safe.

Allison?

Caleb?

Kyle?

<i>Will you do what you have to do?

What you have to do...

Human Usan as we used guinea pigs.

Want to see how many times can destroy us.

And it's not just out of curiosity.

They do it for fun.

They laugh now...

watching me talk to someone that does not even exist.

Not that it matters much.

All dead.
