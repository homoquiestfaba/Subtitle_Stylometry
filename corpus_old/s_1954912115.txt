(THUMPING CONTINUES)

MAN: Father Barrow?

Father James asks if you're ready.
He needs you now.

(MAN 2 SPEAKING, INDISTINCT)

(MAN 2 CONTINUES)

(GROWLING CONTINUES)

Will you be joining us?

I fear not.


(GROWLING, SNARLING)

MAN 2: Depart, accursed one.
Depart with all your deceits.

Depart then, transgressor.

Depart, seducer,
full of lies and cunning,

foe of virtue,
persecutor of the innocent.

Give place, abominable creature.

Give way, you monster.
Give way to Christ,

in whom you found none of your works.

(WATER SIZZLING)
(GROWLING)

For he has already stripped you of your
powers and laid waste your kingdom,

bound you prisoner
and plundered your weapons.

He has cast you forth
into the outer darkness,

where everlasting ruin
awaits you and your abettors.

To what purpose do you insolently resist?
(GROANS)

To what purpose do you brazenly refuse?

For you are guilty before Almighty God,

whose laws you have transgressed.

You are guilty before his Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ,

whom you presumed to tempt.

You are guilty
before the whole human race,

to whom you proffered by your
enticements the poison cup of death.

BOTH: Amen.

Is the cochon prepared?

Expulsion is near.

Therefore, I adjure you,
profligate dragon,

in the name of the spotless Lamb,

who has trodden down the asp
and the basilisk...

and overcome the lion and the dragon,

to depart from this woman
and her unborn child,

to depart from the church of God.

And when he had cast you out,
you did not even dare,

except by his leave,

to enter into a herd of swine.

And now, as I adjure you in his name,

begone from this woman and her
unborn child... (CONTINUES, INDISTINCT)

(GUTTURAL VOICE) Please help me.

(NORMAL VOICE) Help me. Save me.

My baby. Let me go.

Depart then, impious one...

My baby. Let me go. Please.
Do what you know is right.

For my baby.

Everything's gonna be okay. Trust me.

(GROWLING)
Father, please. The baby is coming.

Help me. Please.

Do what's right! (WHIMPERING)

Yes. Yes.


...give place to the Lord Jesus Christ,

who shed his most precious blood for man.
(WHIMPERING)

She's going into labor.
We have to help her. (VOICE ECHOING)

...from whose sight nothing is hidden.

It is he who repels you,
to whose might all things are subject.

(WOMAN'S VOICE) Please, Father. Help me.

Please. Do what's right.

Please, Father.

(GUTTURAL CACKLING)

What are you doing, Father?

Father, you will always be
a fool for the flesh!

(SCREECHES)
No!

What have you done?

My wife. My baby.


(LOCK CLICKS)

(HANDLE RATTLES)

Good evening, Father.
Evening to you, Elliott.

(SCREAMING, FAINT)
WOMAN ON PA: Lights out in 15 minutes.

(LOCK CLICKS)

I'm Henry Davies.

I'm the chaplain at Clovesdale.

And my attorney tells me
you're the guy to thank...

for being transferred here
instead of prison.

It was nothing. I play basketball
with the attorney general.

I convinced him that you'd be...
best in a Catholic-run institution.

Besides, it was you who had to accept
the plea of insanity to make this work.

Look. (SIGHS)

I received official notice
from the Vatican, and, uh,

I've been instructed
to pass it over to you.

You've been dismissed
from your clerical state.

By papal decree, no less.

"From this moment forth,

you are expressly forbidden
from exercising ministerial functions."

Yeah.
Sorry.

I did all I could.

So I'm no longer a priest.

You understand the decree
that's been handed down to you?

Yes, I do.
Very well.


May God watch over your soul,
John Barrow.

John, I'm going to be retiring soon.

Until I do, I'm gonna be saying mass
every day in the chapel at 8:00 AM.

You're welcome to join us.

Thank you.

(DOOR CLOSES, LOCKS)

â™ªâ™ª (SPEAKERS: ELECTRONIC DANCE)

Party hearty!
ALL: Yay!

Luckiest girl
in the whole wide world, right?

Cheers.
ALL: Happy birthday!

(ALL SHOUTING, HOOTING)

Whoo! (COUGHS)

Oh, my God. (LAUGHS)

You guys, six years ago,
I never would have thought...

that I would be here,
doing this on my birthday.

Thank you so much.

The youngest woman to make partner...

deserves to let loose
on her 24th birthday.

(ALL CHEERING, LAUGHING)

Nobody anywhere has ever
made partner below 30.

Do you know how fortunate
you are right now?

You would not have said that
if you knew me in high school.

Right?
Yeah.

You're the best.
(LAUGHING)

Hey.
Hey! Lydia!

Yeah.

Molly, meet Lydia. Lydia, Molly.

Hi.

It is Molly's birthday, and get this...
She just made partner.

Happy birthday. It's really nice to meet you.
Thank you.

WOMAN: It's getting late. Let's go home.
Okay. Here.

Have a shot.

So are you always this much fun?

You have no idea. Come here.

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

WOMAN: Hey! Jerk!
(KNOCKING)

Let us in! Hey! Open the door!

Come on. Let's dance.

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
All right. All right, all right, all right!



Happy 24th.

â™ªâ™ª (SPEAKERS: ELECTRONIC DANCE)

'Scuse us. 'Scuse us. Molly!

Molly! Molly!

Maybe you should go home.
Oh, that's a good idea.

You guys wanna come home?

Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

Molly! Molly!

Let's go. Molly, we're leaving!

Molly!
Forget it. Come on. Let's go.


Oh, snap.

It's not bad.

MOLLY: Come here.

Hey. (LAUGHS)

Come here.

Enough.

Go to the bed.

That's lovely.
(LAUGHING)

Say, "Happy birthday."

Happy birthday.

Say it again.

Happy birthday.

Okay. Enough. Go to the bed.

You gonna join us, or what?

LYDIA: Yeah.


(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Just a second.


Ms. Hartley?
Yeah.

We got a lot of complaints about noise
from your neighbors early this morning.

You having a party?

Oh, no. I was celebrating my birthday.
(CLEARS THROAT)

You mind if we come in
and take a look around?

No. No. Come on in.

FEMALE OFFICER:
We've also had complaints...

about shouting and yelling
coming from your apartment.

MOLLY: Sorry, Officer.

(SCRATCHING)
(VOICES, INDISTINCT)

You okay?

Y-Yeah. I'm fine. (CLEARS THROAT)

I'm a little bit hungover, but yeah.

Okay. Well, please stay here
while I look around. All right?

Yes, ma'am.

(SCRATCHING, VOICES CONTINUE)



Oh.

I got two!

We have a double 187. One male,
early 30s. One female, late 20s.

Who are they? Do you know them?

Yeah. Yeah.

Did you kill them?

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

No.

If you didn't kill them,
Ms. Hartley, then who did?

(VOICES, SCRATCHING RESUME)

You don't hear that?

No. I don't hear anything.

This is gonna go a whole lot better for you
if you just tell us what happened here.

(VOICES, SCRATCHING CONTINUE)

(VOICES, GROWLING)

You want to know
what happened last night?

Yes.

I didn't kill them.

We did.

"We"?

(DISTORTED VOICE) We.

I've heard enough. Let's go.
Uh, Sam.

You're bleeding.

It's happening.

MALE OFFICER: What's happening?

(DISTORTED VOICE) We're here.

FEMALE OFFICER: What did she say?

We're here!

(BIRD CAWING)

(BIRDS CAWING)

BARROW: Dear Heavenly Father,
thank you for this day.

Thank you for my being able
to wake once again,

to see and to hear this morning.

Amen.
Amen.


I'm proud of you, Barrow.

A man of lesser faith would have turned his
back on God after what you've been through.

Excuse me while I make my final rounds.

What are you gonna do with all your free
time once you've retired from this place?

I'll be teaching at a local seminary,

where there's a residency awaiting me.

Besides that, what else?

Drinking a lot of beer,
playing a lot of basketball.

Which you're welcome to do with me...

when they release you from this place.

Thanks.

(SHOUTING, FAINT) No! No! No!

(LAUGHING, FAINT)

(SHOUTING, FAINT)

Hartley, Molly.

You are being held here for a court-ordered
evaluation. It's for your own good.

MAN: How was last night, Mikey?

MOLLY: And what about your own good?

Janet Marie Jones.

(VOICES, INDISTINCT)

(GUTTURAL VOICE) Janet Marie Jones.

(VOICES CONTINUE)

MAN: Everything okay?

(VOICES CONTINUE)
Janet, is everything okay?

Do you want us to call someone?

No. No. No.

I'm, um... I'm fine.


Are you all right?
Yes!

I said yes.

Get her processed, please. Now.

WOMAN: Janet, what happened?


(PA: FEEDBACK)
WOMAN: Lights out.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Oh, God. Excuse... Excuse me! Excuse me!

Someone help me!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
(SCREAMING GROWS LOUDER)

Somebody help me! Get out!

(KEYS JINGLE)
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

Hello, Molly. I'm Dr. Laurie Hawthorne.

I know who you are.

I'll be meeting with you several times
a week while you're here...

for evaluation as we prep you
for your future beyond these walls.

You aren't scared to be in here with me?

Should I be?

You read the file?

I have.

Says here you had a complete
and total mental breakdown...

A breakdown that started
on your 24th birthday.

Is that right?

We'll be evaluating you here with us
for the next 30 days.

I'm... I won't be here that long.

What is it, Molly?

Whatever it is, we're here
to help you through it,

to help you to the next stage.

What do you mean, the next stage?

Of your life.

Molly, your father committed suicide
in a mental institution...

after he was found guilty
of murdering your mother.

How much do you remember of that?

Does my file tell you...

that my parents
were also into the occult?

Of course.

I'm not insane, Dr. Hawthorne.

I don't think that you are.

I'm possessed.

Molly, multiple personalities are...


You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

Molly, I can only help you if you're...

I had a counselor like you once.

In high school.

She thought she knew
what was best for me too.

She's dead now.

WOMAN: Doctor! Doctor!

Doctor. Doctor. Doctor!

(BABBLING, GASPING)

Doctor! (GRUNTS)

Hartley's counselor, Dr. Emerson,
boyfriend, Joseph Young,

were eventually found
to have ties to the occult.

Both were found dead
in a bizarre double suicide...

shortly after Hartley
escaped from their cult...

and moved to Michigan
to start a new life.



(WHISPERING PRAYER)



She did this.

She brought him here.

We need to do something.

(RAGGED BREATHING)

HAWTHORNE: Molly, today I would like
to talk about your past.

I'd like to talk about the occult.

I want you to know
that I am not like them.

You can trust me.

I want what's best for you.

Do you know that, Molly?

I'm here to help you through this.

(SCRATCHING, GURGLING)

Molly?

(EXHALES)
Molly?

(GURGLING CONTINUES)
Molly, are you okay?

What's happening?


Oh!



Our Father, which art in heaven,

hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
in earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread...

and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory,

forever and ever.

Amen.

(GROWLING, SNARLING, FAINT)

Stop it.

Stop it.

(GROWLING, SNARLING CONTINUE)

Stop it.

Stop it.

Stop!

Stop it!

(THUMPING, FAINT)

(INTERCOM BEEPS)

MAN: Dr. Hawthorne,
you've got to come see this.

On my way.

(THUMPING CONTINUES)

Oh, my God.

Molly?

Molly.

Molly!

Molly.

Stop!
(ROARING)


(MOLLY GROANING, SCREAMING)

WOMAN: Molly, settle down.


(SCREAMING CONTINUES)



Hello, Molly. How are you feeling?

(LOCK CLICKS)

I'm sorry I had to do this,
but it's for your own protection.

You hurt yourself badly.

In rereading the transcripts of your case,
I was struck by something.

You claimed that on your 18th birthday,

you were essentially
possessed by the devil.

Correct?

But you testified you believed
that this was only the first phase.

You quoted your school counselor,
Dr. Emerson,

the woman who betrayed you,

as saying, "We have watched you grow.

There are great things ahead.

You are the one."

You said in court that you've come
to believe that what she meant by that...

was that you will be the one who will
return Satan to this mortal coil.

Is that correct?

You believe your possession on your
18th birthday is like a pregnancy...

A pregnancy you thought would come
to term in your 24th year.

Don't you see, Molly?

Maybe this is some sort of psychosomatic
self-fulfilling prophecy.

You believed this would happen
on your 24th birthday,

so now your mind is willing it to be.

And it's manifesting physically
with the vomiting and the noises.

Why else would this... this possession
need to incubate from 18 to 24?

Can you tell me why, Molly?

Molly?

I have been thinking about it.

And?

It's because it's six years later.

Six years, six months,
six days, to be exact.

666.

But six months and six days
after your 24th birthday...

That's only a few days away.

(GASPS, GROANS)

(GROWLING)
Stop.

Molly, I can't understand
what you're saying.


I can't understand
what you're saying, Molly.


Molly?

Molly.
(GASPS)

(GRUNTS, GROWLS)

He's coming!

(GLASS SHATTERS)
(YELPS)



7:06.

Sixth hour and 66 minutes.

(THUMP)
(GASPS)

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

WOMAN'S VOICE: Father.

Father.

(VOICE, INDISTINCT)




Help me.

What'd you say?

(SOFT GROWLING)

Please. Please.

Do what's right.

MAN: Hey, Barrow. Bedtime.

(GROWLING, SNARLING)

(GUTTURAL LAUGHING)


Molly?

Molly.


Code gray! (SCREAMS)

Help! Help!
We need restraints in here now!


Help! Now!


(GROWLING, SNARLING)

(DISTORTED ROAR) I'm coming!


(PRAYING, INDISTINCT)

Excuse us, please.

Father Barrow.

I haven't been called that in a while.

I need to talk to you right away.

Of course.

It's one of our other patients.

Molly Hartley?

Yes. I think she's possessed.

Then what you need is a priest.

I read that once a man is ordained
as a priest, he's always a priest.

What you need is a priest
that's still ordained by the church.

Things are happening.


Can we talk somewhere else?

I read that there are
two types of exorcisms...

Solemn and unofficial.

A solemn exorcism has to be
approved by the church.

An unofficial exorcism
can be performed by a layperson.

Someone's been doing their homework.

After all the lawsuits
and bad media attention,

the Roman Catholic church no longer even
teaches priests how to perform exorcisms.

As of last year, there's only 17
trained exorcists in all of America.

Including me.
Including you.

Yeah.
And of those 17,

only one has been involved
in an actual exorcism.

Me.
You.

You know the ritual of exorcism, Barrow.

You no longer need approval.

Think of this as your redemption.

There's no such thing.
Please.

I can't go to the cops.
They won't believe me.

Just take a look at her.
This young woman, she needs you.

She's in pain.
(SIGHS)

We have no time.

What about your freedom?

You do this for me, I sign
your release papers. Simple as that.

It's not that simple.

When did this happen?

Last night at 7:06.

BARROW: How do you know that?

HAWTHORNE:
Because all of the watches and clocks...

stopped at that
exact same time last night.

Sixty-six minutes after the sixth hour.

JONES: He's here!

His time is near!


Save us! (SCREAMS)

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

WOMAN ON PA: Everyone to their rooms.
Lockdown in effect.

(SIRENS, DISTANT)

Mind if I have a moment
to talk to the patient alone?

Of course.


(GROWLING CONTINUES)

Hello, Molly.

My name is John Barrow.

I know who you are, Father Barrow.

I'm not an actual priest anymore.


So stupid.

Pardon me?

Like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

I'm not talking to Molly, am I?

No.

I'd like to talk to Molly.

No Molly. Only us.

(GROWLING)
Us who?


"And he asked him, 'What is thy name?'

And he answered, 'My name is Legion.'"

You know the Bible, I see.
The opiate of the masses?

You know what happens next
after that verse you cited?

"There was nigh unto the mountain
a great herd of swine.

And forthwith, Jesus sent the demons
into the swine.

And the herd ran violently into the sea,
and they drowned in the waters."


But I like that very much.

You do?
Yeah.

And now they sent a pauper
for the prince!


You're referring to the fact
I'm no longer a priest.


Dr. Hawthorne told you that.


The things they tell
in the bowels of hell, Barrow.

Call Johnny Milton. I just wrote
another verse for his doggerel about me.

Paradise Lost.
Paradise now.

Paradise right here and now.


Paradise, right here, right now.
Come here.

I'll show you what I mean.


You cannot seduce me, demon.


Is Molly in there with you?

I'd like to talk to Molly.
Why, so you can help her?

I would like to talk to Molly.

So you can help her like you tried
to help the others? (GASPS)

(MAN'S VOICE) What have you done?

My wife! My baby!

(DISTORTED VOICE)
You're nothing but a failure, priest!

I wanna see Molly Hartley.





Did you enjoy that, Barrow?
Was it everything you hoped for?

She's stronger than you think.

She's in there,
and I'm gonna help her out.

(SCREAMING, ROARING)

Ah!

(SCREAMING, ROARING CONTINUE)

Was Molly an exceptional student?

HAWTHORNE: That's the thing.

In high school, she was
an average student. Nothing special.

Then on her 18th birthday,
everything changed.

Wharton School of Business,
straight A's.

Graduated a semester early,
magna cum laude.

Hired on at a top financial firm
shortly afterward...

and made partner at 24.

It's almost like she had some sort
of helping hand along the way.

What about in literature?

John Milton, Paradise Lost?

It's doubtful she'd have
any of that knowledge.

Not from business school, anyway.

I have to review her high school
academic file further.

So what do you think?

If you don't mind,
I'd like to see somebody.

Consult with. Confidentially, of course.

(BELL CHIMING)

BARROW: Chaplain Davies.


They let you out?
Not exactly.

What brings the prodigal son here to me?

I think there's a patient at Clovesdale
that needs an exorcism.

I don't care if she spoke the entire Bible
backwards in Aramaic.

There's no way the church is going
to approve an exorcism in this day and age.

I know.
Then what are you doing here?

Because in my experience,
the girl is possessed.

So help her.

But know what you're doing
might have serious consequences.

I know, but I'm not a priest anymore.

Don't have to be in the NBA
to play basketball, right?

Is your reluctance really
to do with what happened last time?

Yeah.

It is.

Wait here.

I have something for you.

I kept these for you,
locked up down there.

God, wash away the iniquities of this
building and cleanse it from its sins,

taking away all place
of refuge for the dark one...

as he's vanquished from your
humble servant, Molly Hartley.


come to my assistance
who you've created in your likeness...

and who you've redeemed
at a great price...

from the tyranny of the devil.

(LOCK CLICKS)


(BREATHING HEAVILY)


(GROWLING, ROARING)

Why don't you untie me now?

Are you gonna wait for the cock
to crow three times,

like that fool who founded your church?

I'm with no church.

I come armed only with the faith in the Lord
that banished you to the bowels of hell.



Most glorious prince
of the heavenly armies,

defend me in my battle
against principalities and powers,

against the rulers of this dark world,

against the spirit of wickedness
in the high places.

(ROOSTER CROWS)


The supplicant's position.

The perfect place for a meager servant.

Do you want to kiss my ring? Or my lips?

You can have any of this!
Silence, demon.

In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

as it was in the beginning,

as it is now and ever shall be,
world with no end.

Amen.
(ROARING)

Why did you fail me, Barrow?

Please, Barrow, stop this.
This is no way to help your flock.

You know how this will end.
You can't fool me again, demon.

You're not her.

You're not her!

I invoke all God's virtues...
Oh, Barrow!

Against every hostile,
merciless power...

that assails her body and her soul,

against the false laws of heresy,

against the deceits of idolatry,

against the art and the spells that
bind the souls of every man and woman.

Free Molly Hartley from your evil.

Begone! In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Make place for the Holy Spirit
in the name of the...

Our Father, who art in heaven,

hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread...

and forgive us our trespasses...

as we forgive those

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

You keep your shit away from me!

(WATER SIZZLING)
(GROWLING)

I cast you out, unclean spirit,

along with every satanic power
of the enemy,

every specter from hell...

and all of your fell companions...

in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Begone!
(ROARS)

And stay away from
this creature of the Almighty.

Begone from Molly Hartley!

(GRUNTING)
The Holy Spirit commands you.

The Holy Spirit commands you!
(GROANING)

The Holy Spirit commands you!

(HOLY WATER SIZZLING)
The Holy Spirit commands you!

God the Father commands you.

God the Son commands you.

The blood of the martyr commands you.

The continence of the confessor
commands you.

The devout prayers of every holy man
and woman commands you.

(ROARS)


I'm here!

(GROANS)
I'm here!

(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)
(GROANING)


You can do this, John.

You just have to believe.
That's what I'm afraid of.

What if my belief in God is outweighed
by the fear of the devil?

Not your belief in God or the devil.

You have to believe in yourself.

And in Molly.

My hour's upon thee, Barrow.

Today is the day. 666.

Six years, six months and six days...

since this stinking piece of flesh
became impregnated with my spirit.

You know what this is?


Do you know what this is?
It's time for my birth!

Answer me!
BARROW'S VOICE:
"There was nigh unto the mountain...

a great herd of swine.

Forthwith, Jesus sent the demons
into the swine.

And the herd ran violently into the sea
and drowned in the waters."

That's very good.

Now you must know
I'm going to cast you out of Molly,

by the power of Christ,

and send you into the swine.

(DISTORTED VOICE)
A pathetic cradle for a king.

By the name of Jesus Christ,
my God and my Lord,

and strengthened
by the power of my faith,

I confidently undertake to repulse
the attacks and deceits of the devil.

(LAUGHS)
Most cunning serpent,

you will no longer dare to torment
this young woman and sift her like wheat.

(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)

God, use your mighty hand...

to strike him from your servant,
Molly Hartley.

Begone!

(GROANING)
Begone!

Begone!


(GEARS RATCHET)

(METALLIC CLINK)

You must be Father Barrow.

I'm Molly.


You know I can't repay you
for what you did for me, right?

You don't have to repay me.

Thank you.

It's nothing.

You've done this ritual before?
No.

But I have confidence he will guide me.

It's safe down there?

Safe as anywhere else.

What is this?

It's the Sigil of Baphomet.
It's the insignia of the Church of Satan.

I've been prepping myself
for the ritual.

These symbols, what are they?

Did they teach you nothing in seminary?

I studied the removal of demons,
not the celebration of them.


Let's sit down.

(FAINT GROWLING)

They're occult symbols
that translate to "Leviathan."

Leviathan?

L-V-T-Y-N. Leviathan.


Members of the Church of Satan
adorn themselves with the symbol.

What is Leviathan?

It's a version of their second coming.

The beast rises from a lake of fire.

Some people say it's the same creature
as prophesied in Revelation.

When Anton LaVey
wrote the Satanic Bible,

he broke it into four books.

He named the fourth and final book,

which deals solely with
the beginning of end times,

"The Book of Leviathan."

They think they can raise it?

Yes.
How?

By the performance
of an occult ritual...

involving a contained spirit
of the devil,

along with the performance
of the greatest sin of all...

Matricide.

Matricide?
The killing of the devil's mother.

The woman it grew inside of.

The woman it was birthed from.

Molly Hartley.

The cochon...
I need to see it right now.

I don't think we should disturb it
until after the ritual.

I need to see the cochon.

DAVIES: I'll take that.



Hello?

(VOICES, FAINT)



Help me, please!

Please, let me go! I can't... (COUGHING)







(BANGS)
Hey!

Can you help me?

Could you open the door for me?

He only helps those who help themselves.

(BANGING)
Help!

Hello? Help!

Hello?

There you are.

(PHONE RINGS)
(GASPS)

Dr. Hawthorne.


(OFF-HOOK SIGNAL)

(MOLLY GASPING)

MOLLY: Let me go!



(FLASHLIGHT SHATTERS)

(DIALING, RINGS)

Doctor.
(GASPS)

Elliott. Thank God you're here.

I... There was no one at the front desk.
I think I just got a prank call.

After everything that's happened,
I guess I just scared myself.

Elliott?

What's wrong?

Elliott?

(DOOR UNLOCKS)

Let's go, now.

Where are you taking me?

To bear witness to his birth.

Look, I...
To bear witness to his birth.

Now.

Take it easy.

All right? Take it easy.


(GASPING)
(DAVIES SPEAKING LATIN)

(CONTINUES IN LATIN)

(MOLLY SOBBING)

Come, Lord of Darkness,

and look favorably upon this sacrifice
we have prepared in thy name.

Restrain her!

Here.

My God.

What is happening?






Mighty Satan, we entreat you
to accept this sacrifice...

of your very own mother...

The woman who bore your seed for 666,

the woman who brought you to term...

That you may
return to us in blasphemy...

as the books of heaven and hell
have prophesied.



Release the devil's spirit!

Hail Satan.
ALL: Hail Satan.

Bring me the father.



Why you doing this?

Being a lamb of God makes it easier
to lead you to the slaughter.

You.

You killed those patients.

Witnesses.

And the devil's father
shall bear witness to it all.

Devil's father?

You are the one who birthed him
from his mother...

through your profane exorcism.

Okay. All right, listen to me.
Don't hurt her, okay?

These are the devil's spirit.

And when they mingle
with her slain blood...

No, hey.
The Leviathan shall arise!

Let her go!

(BLADE STABBING FLESH)
(GRUNTS)


Everybody back!

Get back!
(GROANING)


(GROANING)
Nobody move!

Go to hell!

(DISTORTED VOICE)
You have all betrayed me!

Get outta here!


HAWTHORNE: Come on.
Let's go. Come on!


Get up.

BARROW: Come on.

ORDERLY: Stop!

BARROW:
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

Freeze!

(SIRENS WAILING)

BARROW:
Police told us Chaplain Davies...

has been involved with this
since you were born.

The police found his records
in the chapel.

It has the names
of all the cult members on it.

You're safe now.
I won't let you down again.

I trust you, Father.

Thank you, both of you.

(AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING)


GIRL: Just stop it!
