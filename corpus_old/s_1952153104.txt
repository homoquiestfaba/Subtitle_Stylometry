Darling David, where have
you been all my life?

Where have you been,
where have you been?

Where have you been?

The only thing
I needed was this man.

Oh, Edie!
What?

What did you say, Edie?

All I needed was
this man-- David.

No, she was gorgeous.
Edie had everything.

She doesn't remember
what she was.

Everybody looks and thinks
and feels differently

as the years go by.

Edie, look.

Your wedding jewels,
Mother darling.

Yes.

Here...

do me up, chicken.

This might be the last
time I wear these.

Why?

Why?

Because next time
this will be dangling

from your neck, not mine.

And these--

these will grace the ears

of Mrs. J. Paul Getty.

Mother.

''Mrs. J. Paul Getty.''

That has a lovely ring to it.

Or Mrs. Jordan McClanahan.

Now I hear he has
his eye on you.

He's bound to propose
after tonight.

You look absolutely gorgeous.

The doctor was right about
your hair growing back.

No one will notice.

He also said that
it could all fall out

again at any moment,
so I have that

to look forward to,
haven't l?

lt'll be fine.

Now don't be long.

Sir.
Edith, you look divine.

Where's little Edie?

lsn't she ready yet?
She needs a minute.

lt's been over an hour, darling.

Well, you know Edie.

Always the queen
of the dramatic pause.

I suppose I could
entertain our guests

with a little song while we wait.

I prefer they don't leave
before Edie has been presented,

but thank you, Edith.

Ah. There's our girl.

Miss Beale,
they're ready for you.

Edie!

Edie.

Come on back in.

I can't.

Edith, you'll never get
a man to propose to you

if you don't have a debut.

And if you can't get
a man to propose to you,

well, you just--
''You might as well be dead''?

lf you don't get married,
how on earth

do you plan to take care
of yourself?

You know I want to be
an actress and a dancer.

Once you married Father,

he made you give up
your singing.

I won't let that happen to me.

I still sing,

and I have a perfectly
marvelous marriage.

When are you going
to learn, Edie?

You can have your cake
and eat it too in this life.

No, you can't, Mother darling.

Edie, find a man

who'll give you a long leash,

get married

and then you can do
whatever you want.

Come on.

How about
Mrs. Howard Hughes?

Too greasy.

You're absolutely right.

Edie? Oh, Edie!

Have you fed Buster?

Yes, Mother,
I fed him his luncheon.

Oh, there's a horrible smell.

I can hardly stand it.

Oh, will you shut up?
lt's a goddamn beautiful day.

Just shut up!

Well, look what
the cat dragged in!

lt's the Maysles.
Hello, Edie.

I was just thinking
about you.

What brings you
out to Grey Gardens?

We'd like to do a movie
just about you and your mother.

Yeah.
Really? What about the Bouvier movie?

Well, Jackie's
probably too busy

being Mrs. Aristotle
Onassis, huh?

Your cousin Lee sort of
lost interest in that and...

pulled the plug.

Oh, Al, that's terrible.

You and your mother
were the best part of it,

to be perfectly honest.

Mother and I are
very entertaining, that's true.

So this movie would just be
starring me and Mother,

no one else?
That's the idea.

Well, then it looks
like the Beales

just stole
the Bouvier movie.

This is great.

This is going to be
my big chance--

my chance to relaunch
my career.

Edie!

The Maysles are back
to make a movie

about us, Mother darling.

Do you think your mother
will go along with it?

lt's her house
and she has in it

who she wants in it.

You understand.

Oh my heart,
how perfectly flattering.

Hello, Mrs. Beale.

An old woman like me, no.

l'm not much
of an actress you know.

So, boys, now explain to me:

Exactly how would this work?

ls there a script?
l'm a very quick study.

Are you the director then, David?

Well, no script. No director.

lt's a documentary.
You just do what you do,

and we just stay
in the background.

Just artists making
a film about artists.

We've always been mad
about the movies--

''Gigi'' with Leslie Caron.

Oh, marvelous.
Did you ever see that?

Of course.
Yeah.

lt all sounds terribly exciting.

And I assume
we'll share in the profits.

To be honest,
the words ''documentary''

and ''profit'' don't usually end up
in the same sentence.

There's never been
one about us.

l'm certain that
we can work something out.

We'll work something out.
Yeah.

And l'll need a clause
in my contract

that lets me do roles
in other movies.

Well, sure.
Absolutely.

I don't think that's--
That's not a problem.

Then that cements the deal.

They're here already.
Oh, my goodness.

Buddy, Phelan.

Last one in is a rotten egg.

Boys, no running
in the house.

Good morning, Mr. Beale.

Hello, Robert.
Hello, hello.

Molly!

We didn't expect you till
later this afternoon.

Oh, it's all right, Molly.
lt's okay.

Hello.
I just couldn't wait.

Go on.

Edith.

Now this is
far too extravagant.

What you've got here is
a veritable army of--

we're in the midst
of a depression, Edie.

l've already had to let
half my staff go and...

you're going to have to
cut back as well.

lt takes many many hands
to run this house properly, Phelan.

You can keep Molly and Frank
but the rest have to be dismissed.

What about Gould?
What about him?

You can't deprive the children
of their music lessons.

That would be cruel.

Fine.

Molly, Frank and Gould,

but that's it.

Now as far as Edie is concerned...

please, get her engaged to a...

stable person.

Though l'm not sure
either one of you

would know stable if it
walked through your soup.

Well, whatever do you mean?

You know exactly
what I mean, Edith.

She's unpredictable.

That stunt at the Pierre
did not go unnoticed.

Oh, Phelan, please.

She's high-spirited.

Well, whatever euphemism
you've got for it...

get her settled
in with a good family.

This is your job,

your sole responsibility.

What, you're
leaving already?

I have to work, Edith.

Someone has to pay
for the Maidstone Club

and all those goddamn
crab sandwiches.

And someone has to tend
to his secretary.

Gould, you're here.

Edith, darling.

Oh, you look divine.

Oh, so do you.

Are you in voice?

I haven't practiced in ages.

That's why l'm here, hmm?

Well, then l'm off.

Children, say goodbye
to your father.

He's suddenly been
called back to the city.

Already?

l'll see you
on the weekend.

Goodbye, Buddy.

Bye, little man.
Goodbye, Father.

Can I come with you? Please.

lt's the summer, Edie.
There's no one your age in town.

But there's a dance class
l'd like to attend.

Just find yourself a nice fellow
from the Maidstone Club.

That's all you have to
focus on this summer.

Oh, Father,
but they're just so dull.

Edie... enough.

That's a Spanish wall
garden over there.

The Hills, they put that in.

They imported
everything from Rome.

Mrs. Hill, she was a famous, uh,

horticulturist.

That was one of the famous
gardens of America.

Edie, you look fantastic.

David, you look
absolutely terrific.

Honestly.
You've got light blue on.

Well, Al,
you're still, um--

Mother says
you're very conservative.

This is the best thing
to wear for today, you understand,

because I don't like
women in skirts.

And the best thing
is to wear pantyhose

or some pants under
a short skirt, I think.

Then you have the pants
under the skirt.

And then you can pull
the stockings up

over the pants,
underneath the skirt.

And you can always take off
the skirt and use it as a cape,

so I think this is
the best costume for the day.

Okay.

l have to think
these things up, you know?

Mother wanted me to come
out in a kimono,

so we had
a quite a fight.

Al, was that good?
You want me to do that again?

What a body, Beale.

''Smart and sleek, she sits,

Ready with her playful quips,

Wondering who will
come her way

To dine her,
to wine her,

Which to snare to stay.''

William Blake.

Edith Beale-- poet,
temptress, entertainer.

That was great,
cousin Edie.

Ah. lt's in
the Bouvier blood.

You can do it, too,
Jacqueline.

Mr. Strong.

The children are
all at the beach.

Shall we have our lesson?

Of course, darling.

Let's.

How about this one?

Aren't they just divine?
Divine.

Brava.

Should I tell them
about Gould?

Gould was mother's
accompanist.

He was
a boogie-woogie composer

with the most terrific style.

He was the most
brilliant man I ever met--

that's including Mr. Beale
and Mr. Bouvier.

Completely brilliant.

l came down here to live
in this-- this house...

because I did all
my singing here.

l was so happy.

l was happier singing...

than anything l've ever done
since I was born.

l liked it better...

than anything I ever did.

Come on, Edie, soft-shoe.
How can you resist?

Whoo!

Mr. Beale.

Edith!

Mr. Beale,
what are you doing here?

lt's only Thursday.

lt's Friday, Edith.
Oh.

Get everyone
out of here...

including him--

goddamn Ganymede.

l'm right here, Phelan.
l can hear you.

All right, everyone,
time to go home.

Time to go home.

Au revoir.

You get away
from that door. Go.

Go.
Come on, Edie.

lt used to be charming, Edith.

Now it's just sad.

And what's that, Phelan?

You're the mother
of my children, not a showgirl.

And mothers can't sing?

You know what I mean.

Edie.

Enough is enough.

l'm making a change.

l'm putting the boys
in boarding school

and l'm bringing little Edie
back to the city

before you ruin her
altogether.

Oh!

Ruin her.

Why, because she was
dancing at a party?

The priest said
she needs a strong hand.

l'm sick and tired of this
conversation over and over.

And where are you
in all this,

Mr. Father of my children?

l don't need this.

Well, neither do l.

Then you'll live
your life...

and l'll live mine.

With pleasure.

Mother.

Mother, please.

Aren't you going
to say goodbye?

Why?

Where are you going?

l'm going
to New York, Mother.

Why, that's just crazy.

What are you going
to do in New York?

l'm going to be
an actress and a dancer.

And of course your father
is going to make

all the introductions.

ls that it?
Set you up?

With all his

show business connections
at the law firm?

l worry
about you, babe.

Stay here.

l'm strong.
You've always said that

l was a staunch character,
remember?

Stop that.
Cut it out!

l want your blessing,
Mother, please.

Edith.

Edie, Edie.

There's nothing there
that you can't get here.

You can travel
the whole world

and you'll still never
find anything

as beautiful as right here.

Besides...

Gould doesn't know
how to soft-shoe.

Who am I going
to dance with?

Goodbye, Mother.

Edie! Oh, Edie!

She never answers me,
that women.

l suppose I won't get out
of here until she dies or I die.

Who's ''she,'' the cat?

l don't know when
l'm going to get out of here.

Why do you want
to get out?

Because I like freedom.

Well, you can't get it, darling.

You're being... supported.

You can't get freedom
when you're being supported.

l thought you always said
you can't get freedom

when you're not being
supported, remember?

lt's awful both ways,
l guess.

l'd just like a couple of days
on the beach. That's all.

Everything is good
you didn't do.

At the time
you didn't want it.

Everybody looks and thinks

and feels differently
as the years go by.

lt's very difficult
to keep the line

between the past
and the present.

Awfully difficult.

Hello, Father.
Sorry l'm late.

l've ordered for you.

So...

Yes?
...isn't this the part

where you ask me
if l've met someone new?

Well, have you?

l meet new people
all the time.

That's not what I meant
and you know it.

l can't afford to support
you indefinitely, Edie.

Who do you think pays
for women like you?

Men like me.
''Men like me.''

Between your room
at the Barbizon

and your allowance,
your mother's allowance--

Your new fake wife's allowance.

Don't be insolent.

Do you want
this check or not?

And that position is still open

at the law firm.

You're a smart girl, Edie.

And you're more than capable
of secretarial work.

l don't know why you can't
hold one of these jobs.

Just promise me

you'll try to get
back on course.

Yes, Father.

At least you've given up that

foolish notion of performing
your mother infected you with.

Oh, yes, absolutely.

Who is that guy
at the third table?

The name's Julius Krug.

The Secretary of the lnterior?

No idea.
Watch out, he's married.

Heavens!
lt's Max Gordon.

Who's that?

You don't know
who Max Gordon is?

He's a famous producer.

Max Gordon discovered
Judy Holliday

and is generally considered
the king of Broadway.

lt is a beautiful ocean
today, isn't it?

What color would
you say it was?

Blue.

You're absolutely right.

Sapphire.

Oh, this is the most
beautiful place on earth.

l don't know how anyone
could prefer New York City.

l'm terribly sorry
to interrupt your luncheon,

but I know we haven't been
properly introduced.

l'm Edith Bouvier Beale
and you're Max Gordon.

Thank you. l'd had a few
of these and I started to wonder.

l hear you're on the lookout
for the next great actress.

l am casting
a new musical this summer.

l just adore musicals

and I do terrific dances.

l was doing the V.M.l.
marching song,

which is a ground maneuver,
and when I do that,

see, that's when
the plane goes by.

You're quite the comedienne.
You're funnier than Judy Holliday.

We're holding auditions at
the Guild Theater at the end of July.

Ring my office,
put yourself on the list for a shot.

Well, l'll try to squeeze it in.

Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Cute gal.

Miss Beale.
Yeah?

That was quite the little routine
you put on in there.

Why, thank you, Mr.--

Krug. Please call me Cap.
Everybody does.

Cap, that's marvelous.

l was named
after my mother.

She's also Edith.

Would you have dinner
with me, Edith?

Lunch?

Dessert?

You could take me dancing.

Come on, Pinky.

$658.48 to the Maidstone Club.

Edith, let's just cancel it.

No, when Edie comes home
she'll want to go.

Edith, she's not coming home.
Don't say that.

l'll pay for it
out of the Bouvier trust.

Next.

Here's one from P.C.
Shank & Sons for $89.27

for the heating oil.

Send that one
to my husband.

l already did last month.

Your husband's wife
sent it back.

l am not in the mood
for this, Gould.

Not now.
We'll finish later.

Gould.

Yes, Edith.

You know
l'd be lost without you.

And I you, darling.

Like a moth to the flame.

And what's a moth
without a flame?

Dancing isn't exactly my forte.

You're doing just fine.

So what's he like?

Who?
President Truman.

He and I didn't see eye to eye
on certain things so l...

stepped down
from his cabinet.

Oh, I just adore politics.

How is it you haven't
been snapped up

up by some eligible
bachelor yet, Edith?

Oh, l've sworn
off bachelors.

What do you have
against bachelors?

They're boring, inconsiderate,

pigheaded, stubborn,
spoiled mama's boys

who think they have
a premium on women,

which unfortunately they have,

there being so many
of us girls around.

Hang on.

But one has got to make
the most in a difficult situation,

and that's why women
in desperation

have turned
to the married man.

Married men are
generous and discreet,

they don't make a fuss,
they don't stick around

and they let you have
a career if you want one.

Most girls would be jealous.

Most girls aren't Edith Beale.

All I want in life, Mr. Krug,

is a dance partner.

Goodbye, Edith.

Shh!

Oh my gosh, you're like
a bull in a china shop.

Do you want to get caught?
l'm sorry.

Oh, God,
if they find you here

l'll be out on the streets,
no questions asked.

What's that?

Oh, Cap, it's divine.

But it's far too generous.
lt suits you.

So you've bought me now,
is that it?

Of course not, Eade.

l just love
to see you shine.

lt's exciting.
Oh, don't.

l ate too much.

l have to lose weight
before the audition.

Aw, my angel, Cap.

Who ever said
you can't have it all?

lt wasn't Edith Beale.

Hello, Mother. Yeah.
Edie.

What was that?

l just knocked over a glass.

Have you replied to
Mrs. Cabot's party invitation yet?

No-- I mean yes.

l sent my regrets.
l don't want to travel

all the way out to East Hampton
for just one party.

Well, it wouldn't be
just for that, I hope.

I miss you, chicken.
I miss you too, Mother,

but I really must go.

lt's just that
l'm pressing my blouse

and it's going to burn.

lt's a bit late
to go out now.

Oh no, Mother.

lt's burning.

Edie?
Tomorrow.

Tomorrow.
We'll talk again tomorrow.

No. Edie?

l love you too, Edie.

Can you believe he said
l was funnier than Judy Holliday?

And prettier.
He didn't say that.

Well...

he should have.

l flirt, but it's all talk.

Mostly.

l wish l'd met you before.

Oh, Cap.

She knows that l'm here.

lndeed.

Yes, Mother?
Listen, babe, I was thinking--

were you running?

No, I just got
out of the tub

and ran to the phone.

Have you got
a man there, Edie?

No, of course not.

But so what if I had?

Why don't you
bring him home?

l'd like to meet
this nice young man.

No, stop pressuring me
to come home. l'm getting work.

And l'm just about to get
an audition with--

are you sitting down?

Max Gordon.
The Max Gordon.

l danced for him,
he went to pieces.

He's married.

Well, I don't know
if he's married,

but what does that matter?

Mr. Gordon is
a very prominent producer.

Oh, no no no
no no, Edie.

l don't mean him.

l mean your visitor.

He's married, isn't he?
Mother.

No, Edie, married men
will only break your heart.

l'm fine. l'm happier
than l've ever been.

You know that stress makes
your hair fall out.

Remember?
Mother, l've got to go.

Ooh, I think
she's onto us!

Phelan?
Yes.

lt's me.
l have some news.

ls this about
the check? Because--

No no no,
it's not about the bills.

lt's about your daughter.

Miss Beale?

Your father's here.

He's waiting downstairs
for you in the lobby.

My God, we fell asleep.
Oh God.

Here.

Do you remember this?
May I see that please?

The villain of the piece.

''To my best friend
and most delightful comrade,

to my only sweetheart
and wonderful wife,

l tender this likeness
of her husband,

Phelan Beale, 1929.''

Did I laugh
when I read that.

Aren't kids terrible?

l just roared.

l lived alone
at least 30 years. I didn't mind.

You get to
be very independent

when you live alone.

You get to be
a real individual.

You can't have your cake
and eat it too in life.

Oh, yes, I did. I did.

l had my cake,

loved it,
masticated it, chewed it.

l had everything I wanted.

She was bored.
She couldn't stand it.

No, I was not.
l was a great singer.

l had
a perfect marriage,

beautiful children.

l had a terribly
successful marriage.

No, I never had
a fight in my life.

l never threw anything
at Mr. Beale, never.

No, l-- I never--

never had words with--

with Mr. Beale at all.

Edie, why don't you show
the Maysles the beach?

Do you boys want
to see the ocean?

Sure.
Come on.

Tickets please.

Edie, this will be better
for you-- you can swim,

fresh air. lt's too hot in town.
You love the ocean.

Edie, please.

Edie!

Please say goodbye.

Good evening.
Grey Gardens.

l'll have a look to see
if Mrs. Beale is at home.

Thank you, Molly.
l've got it.

This is Mrs. Beale.

May I speak
with Edith, please?

To whom am I speaking?

Julius Krug.
Oh.

A Mr. Julius Krug
for you, dear.

Cap?

What happened to you?

l'm stuck here
at my mother's house.

Are you all right?

l'm fine.
Okay.

When are you going
to be back?

Well, that's just it--
l don't know.

l have my audition
on Tuesday morning.

l just have to make
it back by then.

l'll take you to lunch
afterwards to celebrate.

Meet me
at the Hampshire House.

Cap.

Yes, Edie?
I l-- um...

I know. Me too.
Cap.

Never say that right after
l say that, okay?

l never want to wonder
if you thought you had to say it.

But I didn't say it.

Right.

l'll see you there.

Good night.
Goodbye.

He sounded
awfully married to me.

Edie!

Edie, come here.

What's wrong, Mother?

Where've you been, woman?
Paris, Mother.

Look. Kitties.
Little baby kitties.

Marvelous. Here.

Look at this one.

And this one.
Poor old Pink.

She must be starving.

Pinky, are you hungry?

We're out of cat food.

l'll go into town,
get some more.

Oh, Edie! Edie!

Get some ice cream.
We'll celebrate.

Yes, Mother darling.

Give that to Mr. Krug,
right away.

Oh, and your name, miss?

Judy Holliday.
Of course.
