Oh, John!

John, this is
Lieutenant-Colonel Sinclair.

Pleasure.
My quest.

Sinclair is here for
Washington Observe.

She spent the last 3 years
researching the project...

...so I've finally decided
to go with her approach.

Yes, I heard about your idea.
Something about a steel cage?

An exo-skeleton. 
Exo-skeleton?

The steel frame allowed me
to control the diseased units,

and at the same time offering
mobility to make them...

...highly effective
bio-weapons.

Lucky for me, the Pentagon
decided to go with a more...

...humane approach.

<i>Post-mortem team to</i>
<i>Sector 6 bio-engineering.</i>

<i>Post-mortem team to</i>
<i>Sector 6 bio-engineering.</i>

Walsh, let me use your
cardkey, please.

Seems to misplaced mine
at home.

Then it did worry you.

For I've seen around here,
security seems rather low-priority.

Ah, well, those damn budget chopping fools
in Congress-

was it for them we had never
permanent facility by now.

God Julie,
What are you doing?

You're so mental!

Stop.

Lone Ranger is here.

Did you get it?

You saw when didn't I?
Let me see it.

How my dad looked
all over the house for it.

Just couldn't seem to find it.

Curt, this is so cool!

So, how do we get in the base?

No problem, I'm the boss' son,
remember?

I can do anything.

Can you guys gonna do Club Kill
of us tonight or what?

I'll call you later.

So, did you find out anything else?

Not even more than you heard
in the phone last night.

The big test, or whatever it is.

It starts at 6 o'clock.
What test?

No test, Mindy!
Butt out!

God, it's so cruel!

I bet they're cutting off
some poor animals or something.

What time is it?

It's 5:30.
5:30?

Come on, Boy Scout!
We gotta jam!

The preliminary result gives
any indication,

maybe something	going to finally
come from the Trioxin after all.

I'm sure it will, sir.

You were part of
the original team...

...that commission Trioxin
from Darrow Chemical, weren't you sir?

It certainly was.

We were going to use it
as a weapon...

...against the war on marihuana
and than came that leakage '69.

We found out about
its special properties.

We did the only thing we could.

After the gas brought the dead
back to life,

we rounded them up,
stuffed them in those barrels...

...did no then
we never be able to destroy them.

How're you doing?
I come to see my dad.

Come on.

It's G-17,
the same as on the card.

Let's try it.

Shit!

Would I?

What are you doing?

It's all the tongue.

Come on.

Curt, look at all this.

It's incredible.

Okay.

Yeah, I think this...

Detective 6, please...
Hurry, come on.

<i>...report all the</i>
<i>1800 hour perimeter rounds.</i>

Commencing around, sir.

Hey, come on.

What's this glass here for?

Oh, no. It looks like
they want to keep the air tight.

Hey, check it out.
We can still see inside.

Oh, my God,
What are they doing in there?

My God.
Oh, shit.

This is creepy.

Come on.
Okay, okay.

Flatline set.

Check electrodes.

Check.

Ready?

We're all set here, sir.

All right.

Let's proceed.

God, Julie, that's my dad.

Don't worry, they can't see us.

Is that guy hanging up there dead?

Are you kidding? Definitely.

Come on.

All vital signs
confirmed at flatline.

Trioxin exposure
commencing at 18:21 hours.

Bring the Trioxin barrel into place.

All right.

I'm opening the valve now.

We got something.

Time's 18:24.

Jesus Christ.

He came back to life.

Phase one complete, sir.

Okay.

Proceed with the paretic infusion.

No! No!

... three... two... one.

We've got flatline.

Proceed with the visual inspection.

Optical reflexes-- none.

No response.

Yes! Looks like we did it.

Affirmative.

Paralysis has been
successfully attained.

This is really warped.

I can't believe my dad.

Oh, I know.

How do they do it?

I knew this would
be worth checking out.

I just knew it!

We've got to get out of here.

Come on.

Come on.

It's okay, Curt.
He didn't see us.

Look, Julie, I don't care.

I've seen enough.

Son of a bitch, John.

You have just changed
warfare forever.

We could put
those bio-units in,

have them run roughshod
over the enemy,

then just stroll on in,
freeze them up,

and pack them away
until the next time.

I must admit, Reynolds,

even though I think the
exo-skeletal approach...

...would be more efficient,

there's no arguing
with your results.

Thank you.

This was really a team effort.

Don't be modest, John.

This was your baby
from the start.

It was John who figured out
that these dead bastards...

...craved brains so they could get
electricity from the neurons.

Oh, is that right?

Then it was just
a matter of developing...

...the acid projectiles to
freeze them up again.

Well, we're on our way now.

No obstruction to mouth tissue.
Esophagus appears clear.

Aah!

Aah!

It didn't hold.
What's going on?

The paralysis didn't hold.

Alert security!

Use the projectiles!

Hook me up, damn it!

Hurry up, load it!

Projectiles!

Shoot the son of a bitch!

Load it again! Hurry up!

Shoot it, damn it!

My God!

He killed Dr. Hickox!

What happened?

What the hell happened?

I don't know.

It didn't hold.

Strap that damn thing down
before it wakes up again.

Ready? Lift.

Get the gurney.

Strap him down.

I'll get the legs.
You get the arms.

Tight!

Get it down tight there.

What about the mouth restraint?

Put it in. Sure.

What the hell
am I gonna tell them?

That'll restrain him.
Especially the mouthpiece.

What the--

Aah!

Jesus Christ!

It didn't hold!

Get him off of me!

Contain it, damn it!

Seal it off now!

Contained.

Open the door!

Open the door, God damn it!

I got him!

Send a team in.
Get everyone out.

I want them all
tied down, living or dead.

Put them all under observation.

I need an explanation
of what the hell happened here.

Son of a--

Washington is expecting
a call from me right now.

What am I gonna tell them?

Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of it.

Before I left I told
General Meade that I'd call him,

just to give him
my objective opinion.

God, I thought that
was incredible, wasn't it?

It was great.

I wonder if he could feel anything.

What?

When that bullet
smashed into his skull--

The dead guy-- I wonder
if he could feel anything?

And that scream--
remember that horrible scream?

I'm trying not to.

I bet he was in hell.
It must be awful to be dead.

Would you just give it a rest?

What's the matter?

You're so carried away
with all this.

And you're not?

We don't even
know what we saw.

We don't know
if that was a corpse.

It could've been a mental patient
or somebody in a coma.

No way Curt,
that was definitely a corpse.

You're still hung up about
seeing your dad there, aren't you?

I told you,
I don't care about my dad.

I never ever see him anyway.

Good.

You don't need him.

You've got me.

I know.

And I'm never
gonna let you go.

Ever.

Oh shit!

What?
My dad's here.

Get dressed.

I got to put the cardkey back.

Curtis?

Yes, sir?

I need to talk with you, son.

What is it, Dad?

I need to talk with you alone.

In my office.

I think he knows something.

What is it?

Sit down.

I got a little bad news tonight.

I'm being reassigned
to another project.

What?

I'm being relocated
to Oklahoma City.

We report in a week.

Oklahoma City?

Dad, we just got here six months ago.

Listen, Curtis, I'm sorry.

I don't like this
any more than you,

but it's nothing
we haven't done a dozen times.

Have your room
packed by Saturday.

Sunday you can
start on the garage.

Did you find that cardkey
we were looking for?

No, I didn't.

I don't understand.

That son of a bitch
has gotta be here somewhere.

Is there something else?

Dad, I'm not gonna go.

What?
I'm not gonna go.

I don't want to go.

I've finally got friends here.

Curtis, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

I'm being transferred.

We leave in a week.
Both of us.

I'm not gonna go.

Curtis!
What?

I've tried to be understanding
of you in the last few weeks.

I let you get that motorcycle.

I deal with you
wanting to be a Rock 'n' Roll drummer,

because you'll outgrow it.

I draw the line here. I won't have
you defying me, understand?

Don't think I don't know
where this is coming from either.

Getting you away from that girl will be
the best thing ever happened to you.

Dad, I'm not going!

Curtis, I'm not finished
talking with you yet.

Don't walk away from me!

What's going on?

My dad's being reassigned again.

I told him I'm not going.
You're kidding.

I'm not kidding.
I'm on my own.

You're moving out?
Yes. It's just me and you.

I'm not finished with you yet.
Yes, you are.

God damn it,
get back in my office!

Why don't you just leave him alone?

Tell your friend
to stay out of our business.

You tell her yourself.

Come on, let's go.

You never acted like this
when your mother was alive.

You keep your hands off of me!

Freak.

Come on, Curt.
I'm going.

I can't believe you did it, Curt.

We're free.
This is great.

It will be at least a week
before my mother notices I'm gone.

Send her a postcard.

Whoa!

Take it easy!
Take it easy?

I've never taken it easy on you.

You're mine, honey, all mine.

Julie!

Come on, stop it.

What's wrong?
You losing control?

You losing control?

Julie.

Oh my God!

No.

Julie.

Julie, talk to me!

Damn it, talk to me!

Help us!

Somebody help us!

You promised.

You promised me.

You can't leave.
You said you'd never leave me.

Right. Go ahead.

Who is this?
This is Emerson, sir.

God, I hope this works.

Oh my God, Julie!

God, Curt, that was incredible!

Let's do it again.

What is this?
What are you wearing?

You don't remember?
Remember what?

Wait a minute.
Where are we?

Oh, God.

I'm so numb.

And my neck--

my neck hurts.

What's going on?

What's wrong with me?

Curt, what happened?

You see, we were on the bike--

What was that?
Come on.

What is it?

I think we'd better get out of here.

I heard something.

Close the fucking door!

Hurry!
What the fuck is that thing?

Damn it!
This thing isn't working.

What's wrong with me?

My heart.
I can't feel my heart.

It's gonna be okay.

What's going on, Curt?
Tell me what happened.

We had an accident.

What kind of an accident?

On the bike.
What happened?

You died.

I what?

I died?

Come on.

Halt!

Curt, is that
what I'm gonna become?

Let's get
the fuck out of here.

Sector 12, containment breach.

It's him, all right.

Looks like we found your card.

Jesus, Curt...

what have you done?

I put out a statewide APB
on your son's motorcycle.

Also, I have the containment
squad assembling right now.

What are his chances?

It seems his girlfriend has been
brought back completely intact.

Obviously, there was a very strong
connection between them.

That should be enough to keep her
from attacking him,

at least until
her brain shuts down.

If she attacks him,

he becomes like her.

Pentagon Special Command
will be here in six hours.

They're leaving Washington now.

Thank you, Colonel.

I also suggested to
General Meade that I go ahead...

...and take over scientific operations.

I don't think you understand,

your command does not start
until 09:00 hours tomorrow morning.

Yes, I do understand,
but under the circumstances--

No.

John will stand his
command until they arrive.

Jesus.

Curt, am I really dead?

Am I really dead?

My skin--
my skin feels so weird.

I don't smell do I?
Do I smell?

You don't smell.

I'm so hungry, if I could
just get something to eat...

...I think I'll be okay.

Working on it, Julie.
I'm just trying to find someplace open.

I saw a store back there--
There were too many people.

They're gonna
be looking for us.

God damn it,
get me some fucking food now!

All right, Mogo!

Kill them all!

Grab the shit, man.
Get it out of there.

Get the fuck out of there.

Die, motherfucker!

Come on, Santos,

let's get out of here, I'm bored.

Just a few more minutes.

You said that an hour ago.

If we would have
left when you wanted to,

he would have never
made it to level seven.

Yeah.

You don't need all of this.

Leave me alone,
I don't know what I want.

When are you gonna know?
I don't know.

When I taste it.

Hey, man,

what the fuck is wrong with her?

Don't worry about it.

Don't you ever feed her?

Hey, he asked you
a fucking question.

Look, stay out of it,
all right?

Did you say something to me?

I don't want any trouble.

Whatever I said, I'm sorry.

Sorry ain't good enough.

You hit him.

I didn't see him there.

I'm sorry.

It was an accident.

You were standing right behind me.

Come on, give me a break!

Just let us go.

Hey, you guys,

take this outside, okay?

Go!

You pay for these
before you eat them.

I have some money.
Pay me.

Okay.
And go.

Here's a 20,
keep the charge.

Come on!

Hey, stop it!
Get away from there!

Hey...

easy, man.

Okay, man.
We're leaving.

You, move out of the way.

Move! Move!

And you, put the money down!

Put the money down!

My God, Santos,
what the hell did you do?

Let's get the fuck out of here!

Santos, he bleeds.

I'll see you later.

Felipe!

Whoo!
Mogo, let's go!

Get out of my way, bitch!

Aah!

That's his bike.

Bitch!
You son of a bitch!

Somebody's gonna be
right here for you, okay?

We've got to get out of
here before the cops get here.

Julie, we have to go,

before the cops come.

Shit!

Come on!

Get in.

Hurry!

Help me.

The hospital... two blocks.

All right. Give me the keys.

Stop! I'll go with them.

Halt!

They're shooting at us!

The police found your son, sir.

Where?
South Central.

They're in pursuit now.

I'm still hungry, Curt.

You're what?!

I'm starving, I'm still hungry.

Jesus Christ, how can
you think of food now?

Stop!

I want out.

Shit!

Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

Oh shit!

They killed him.

Oh, shit.

Julie, no!
No, come back here!

Damn it, it's a dead end.

I think we lost them.

Julie...

What's that noise?

Brains...

Brains...

Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

Stop it!

Julie!

Stop it!

You, in the van!

Put your hands on your head,

and step out
of the driver's side door!

This is your last warning!

Come out or you're
liable to be shot!

Oh my God!

Move! Move!

Contaminated unit, sir.

He's attacking the officer.

Charge me!

Ready. Aim. Fire.

Move in! Move!

Containment unit, get in there.

The rest of you, fan out.

Contain him!

Get a perimeter out there.

Get down.
Take no chances.

Squad three just came back.

Negative.

Sandusky?
Yeah.

Ready to roll?
When you're ready.

No sign of your son
or the girl, sir.

Damn it.

All right.

Let's make this
a starting point.

Begin a circle search,

keep widening the perimeter
till we find him.

And remember,

I do not want my son hurt.

Yes sir.

Come on, we've got
to make it across the bridge.

This can't be happening.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's starting again.

The pain helps.

The pain makes
the hunger go away.

What are you doing?
Stop it!

Don't touch me!

Stay away from me.
Just leave me alone.

What's happening to you?

How could you eat that--

that man?

It's your fault.
Me?

You made me this way.

You brought me back,
you should have left me dead.

Is that what you want?

Do you want to be dead?

All right, that's fine!

What was I thinking?

Look at you,
you're disgusting!

Fuck!

Julie.

Julie!

Julie!

Julie!

Look, don't be stupid.

Julie, get off
the ledge, please.

No.

Julie, damn it,
stop screwing around

and get back over here now.

Just go away.

Julie.
Go away.

I didn't mean what I said before.

I'm sorry.

All I want is for things
to be the way they used to be.

I like you the way
you were before.

The way you were.
The way you used to be.

But--

But I can't be.

Curt, don't you see I can't?

No!

Julie!

Julie!

Where are you?!

Julie!

Julie!

Damn, look at this.

I've never seen so many pigs
turn out for a lousy little hit.

Maybe you killed that guy
in the store.

Hey, relax it with that shit.

I didn't kill nobody.

He was alive.

Santos.

There's something wrong
with Mogo, man.

What's the matter?

I don't know, man.

Ew!
It's his arm, man.

Look.

Oh, shit.

What the fuck happened, Mogo?

She bit me.

Who bit you?

That bitch in the store.

She gave you something.

She gave you something bad.

Well, what is it?

I don't know.

Gangrene, rabies...

maybe the bitch had rabies.

Santos, what are we gonna do?

What are we gonna do?

I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

We're gonna go after the bitch,
and make her pay for this.

That's what we're gonna do.

Santos, there's only
one way out of that alley.

Through the sewer tunnel,

and out the 7th Street bridge.

Let's go to the river.

Let's go to the river, Santos.

Let's go to the river.

Where are you?!

Julie!

Julie!

What the hell do you want?

I saw a river swallow
three men once,

one time back in New Orleans.

It was a night just like this.

Pitch black.

Julie!

They were floating along
just as nice as you want to.

Then they round the corner,

and she rose up like
a big old black viper,

and pulled them under,
just like that.

Swallowed them whole.

Never found one of them.

Julie!

I saw it.

I saw it all.

Just like I saw it here.

Julie!

You know,
from where I was...

...looked like she
jumped in on purpose.

Would you mind your
own goddamn business?

Seems like she don't
want to be found.

And I'm just
telling you what I saw.

Well, nobody asked you.

"Well, I saw it in the mirror."

"I saw it on
the bottom of my shoe."

Julie?

Julie.

Talk to me.
Honey, talk to me.

Leave her be.
She gone.

She can't be.
I'm telling you, kid.

They don't get
no deader than that.

You don't understand.
It's impossible.

She can't die.

Julie.

Julie, talk to me.
Wake up!

Julie.

Mary, mother of Christ.

Let go of me.

Let me go.
No, Julie.

Why are you doing this to me?

It's gonna be okay.

I don't know
what's happening to me.

I'm not alive.

I'm not dead.

I'm just--

I'm just so lonely.

Julie, listen to me,

if we stay together
we can beat this.

No, I can't.
Yes, we can.

Together we can.

You can't give up on us.

Julie, you're all I've got.

And I don't ever
want to live without you.

Ever.

Hey, there they are.

Come on.

Oh, shit.

You fucking bitch,
your ass is grass.

What do they want?

Whatever it is,
it sure ain't good.

You're dead meat!
You motherfucking bitch!

We've got to get out of here.

Come on.
Come on, come on, follow me.

"I saw the light..."

Come on.

Is that her?
Yeah, that's her.

I know how to get around.
Come on!

Come on, son.
Where are you?

John, will you not beat
yourself up about this?

We're doing everything we can.

It just doesn't seem
to be enough, does it?

Sir, we found their escape route.

It's a storm drain that leads
from here to the viaduct,

under the river bridge.

All right, notify the
rest of the troops.

John, hold it.

This just arrived
from General Meade.

Son of a bitch.
What is it?

You're officially being
relieved of your command.

I'm to take over science operations,
effective immediately.

Sergeant!

Yes, ma'am.

As of now, I'm in control
of the situation.

I want it upgraded immediately...

...to total indiscriminate containment.

What?

I said there was to be no
discrimination during containment.

I have my son you're talking about.

The odds are your son is
probably contaminated already.

Well, there's still a chance.

A chance isn't good enough.

Reynolds, what are you doing?

I'm going after my son.

You're no longer part of this effort.

Come on.

What's the matter?

I don't know.

I get these cramps.
I feel so stiff.

Come on.

Come on.

Shut the door.

They'll never find you, down here.

What is this place?

It's a pump room.

I call it a home.

Good lord, she is cold.

Here.

Thanks.

What kind of trouble
are you in, anyway?

Come on, kid!

Level with me.

I may live with rats,

but I sure as hell
ain't one of them.

We were on our way to Seattle.

We got into
a mess with those guys,

there was an argument
and a guy was shot.

Did you do it?

No, they did
and they took off.

So...

what are you
gonna do in Seattle?

I don't know.

I guess maybe get
a job on something.

Maybe get a gig
in a band playing drums.

You a musician?
I don't know.

I've never been in a band,
but it's what I want to do.

I know it sounds stupid.

It don't sound stupid to me.

It doesn't?

You don't think
it sounds crazy?

Hell no.

Sounds like you got
something inside you,

you just got to get out.

Like me,

me and my things.

I figure, if...

...people found out
what they had inside them,

and how to get it out,

there'd be a lot
more happy people.

So you really
think I could do it?

Sure, why not?

Of course, what do I know?

You're talking to a guy
who lives in sewers.

You two stay here,

and rest.

I'll keep a watch outside.

Hey...

I don't even know your name.

So?

Well I wanted to say thanks.

Thanks for everything and...

I'm probably never gonna
have a chance to repay you.

Here.

What's this?
A Mandi Gras coin.

Next time you find
someone who needs help,

you just help them out,
and you give them that coin,

and tell them to do
the same to somebody else.

I figure as long as
that coin keeps circulating,

there will always
be somebody out there...

...doing something
good for somebody.

You got a deal.

You can call me Riverman.

Come on.

Uh, not in there.

Hey, let's just go.

Jesus Christ.
Come on.

Gross.
Come on, this way.

Santos, I think we should
get Mogo to a hospital.

Once we find the bitch.

Santos, a rat.

Come on!

Julie.

What are we gonna do?

What's gonna happen to us?

You want to know
what's gonna happen to us?

We're gonna move to Seattle.

We're gonna get
a nice place on the water.

I'm gonna get a gig in a band.

And you can hang out all night
and party, and watch me play.

Do you really think we'll make it?

Of course I do.

Julie, what's the matter?

What's wrong?

I can't do this anymore.

What?

I can't--

I can't keep pretending--
I mean--

I want it to be like it was before.

But...

...I don't feel the same.

I just--

I feel-- Oh God!

I feel so goddamn hungry!

Julie, come back to bed.

I can't stand being like this.

What's wrong?

What are you doing?

Nothing. Nothing.

I'm sorry, Curt.

I'm sorry.

I just get
a little confused sometimes.

Come on.

Oh... God!

We're never gonna
find our way out of here.

Shut up.
Shit!

They've got to be
here somewhere.

We're never gonna
find our way out of here.

You shut up!

Look up the license on that car.

What the hell is that?

Wake up.

Where is she?

Huh?

Where is she?

Where is she?

I don't know.

Spit it out.

Where am I?

What's wrong with me?

Santos, I don't think
Mogo's gonna make it...

...unless we get him
out of here now.

I know.

But not until he tells me
where the bitch is.

Yes.

Leave him alone.

Leave him alone.

Felipe!

Okay, you little bastard...

...we're gonna do this
the nice and easy way.

Call her.

Call her!

What did we do to you?

We didn't do anything.

Call her or I squeeze the trigger.

Santos, look.

Oh my God.

Ew, God.

What is that?

Julie?

Felipe.

If he moves,
blow him away.

My pleasure.

So you want to join the party?

I like it.
I like it very much.

Kinky.

Nice touch.

But you know what?

You don't look like
you got rabies to me.

You look like my kind of bitch.

Leave her alone.

Don't tempt me.

Felipe...

I do what you say.

Help me.
Don't let me die.

Help me.
Mogo.

Mogo.

Felipe!

I think Mogo's dead.

Shit.

Santos!

Santos!

Oh, God!

Oh, Santos!

Oh my God.
Julie.

What have you done?

Kill her!
Kill her, Felipe.

Kill it!

You crazy bitch!

Julie stop it!

Christ!

Stop it!

No. No. No more.

What happened to you?

How could you?

I can't help it.

The hunger. I--

Hey kid, get in here.

Not her.

Look, I'm not going anywhere
without Julie.

I said no!

Come on, let's go.
Let us in!

Get in here!

Close it!

Mary, mother of Christ!

The zombies.

Shit!
This isn't gonna hold them.

She dead, ain't she?

God damn it! Help us!

Get something
to hammer this with.

This way.

Where are the nails?

Curt, help me.

I'm losing myself, Curt.

When it doesn't hurt,
I get hungry.

The pain isn't helping anymore.

Hey!

I'm getting hungry again.

It's okay.

Curt, help me.

Are you gonna
tie me up, please?

What are you doing?
Tie me up.

Don't you see
what's happening?

Just tie them.

I'm one of them.

Oh, shit.

They're getting through.

This door's not gonna hold them.

They got the door.

Oh, shit!

Is there any way out of here?

There's a ladder.
Where does it go?

Up to the street.

We're not gonna make it,
we don't have time.

I got an idea.

Damn, it's not holding.

You go, I'll stay
and hold them off.

You've got a bullet in your leg,
I can get away faster.

Take Julie and go.

Her? Are you crazy?

It's too late for her.

Listen to me,
God damn it!

We're all getting out of here.
Do you hear me?

All of us.

Take Julie and go.

Take Julie with you.

God, help us.

Julie?

Riverman?

Oh my God.

Julie, not him.

Help me.

Help me end this pain.

What have I done?

Colonel Reynolds, over here.

We've got four contaminated units.

What's behind?

Curt!

Get away from her!

Get away from her, son.

No, Curt.

Don't leave me.

Get out of the way, son.

Get away from her!

The Colonel told me
that you were very helpful...

...during your debriefing.

I just answered
a lot of questions, that's all.

When your mother died,

the hardest thing
I ever did was to let go.

So I just buried myself
in this insane job.

And be cause of that,

I haven't always been there
when you've needed me.

Look, son, I--

I thought maybe we could
take a couple of weeks...

...before Oklahoma City.

Just the two of us.

Spend some time together.

We have a lot to talk about.

Let's get out of here.

Dad...

What's gonna happen to Julie?

I don't know.

She's part
of Sinclair's project now.

John, Sinclair has requested that
your report on the Walker girl...

...be kept under wraps.

Colonel, the fact that
she was cognitive...

...proves that the living dead
aren't just animated flesh.

It proves that
they have an inner life.

The objective
of this program is to create...

...bio-weapons from these units.

Let's not confuse the issue.

If you don't mind,
I have work to do.

John, I have an order
to do as she says.

Destroy the report.

Julie?

You're Colonel Reynolds's son,
aren't you?

Believe it or not,
you're looking...

...at the weapons system
of the future.

The what?

Lock it up! Lock it up!

That one in there
is a prototype.

This one's going next.

You mean Julie?

That's right.

They're all going to
end up like that.

Bio-mechanical weapons
driven by meat batteries.

Never have to be fed
or recharged.

They just keep going
and going...

What are you doing?

What the hell
is he doing here?

Julie, it's okay.

Get the gun!

I knew you'd never leave me.

Shoot!

Get down!

Shoot again!

Watch it!

Help us!

Help us!

Somebody let us out!

Riverman.

Riverman, no.
It's me, Curt.

Do you remember this?

Come on, remember.

It's me.
Help us, please.

Let us out.
Get the door open.

Open the door for us.

Lockdown commencing

Lockdown commencing

Lockdown commencing
in one minute.

Lockdown commencing

Lockdown commencing
in 30 seconds.

Lockdown commencing
in 20 seconds.

Have you seen my son?

No. We gotta get out of here.

We gotta get out.

Eight... Seven...

Six... Five...

Four... Three...

Two... Lockdown.

We got to go.

Curt!

Curt, hurry.

Come on, leave her
and get out of there.

Dad, I can't.

You don't belong in there.

You belong out here.
Come on, son, please.

Son, you got to let her go.

It's over.
She's dead.

I'm sorry, Dad.
It's too late for me.

No, Curt...

No!

John.
John, you're gonna have to leave here.

They're sealing off
the whole building.

Curt!
Damn it, let's go!

We got to get out of here.

We are, Julie.

We are.

Where?

Where we belong.
