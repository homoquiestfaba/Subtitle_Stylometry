ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): This
concludes our broadcast day.

We will resume
broadcasting at 5:30 AM.

Thank you for watching.

Hey, Harold.

Harold.

Turn that television off.

Go away.

Don't be ridiculous.

At least turn the channel.

Go away, Mother.

You're dead.

Oh, really?

Well, you'll never get
anywhere with that attitude.

I'm not listening, Mother.

Hm.

Hitting the hard
stuff, eh, Kunkle?

Once a sissy boy
always a sissy boy.

Hah, hah, hah.

Now, you've got to drink.

Whew hoo!

Chug that beer.

Hey, man, you got a light?

Yeah, sure, Jen, no problem.

M-m.

Thanks, TJ.

No problem.

Now, that is a cigarette.

Hey, Kunkle, you
got any pretzels?

No.

But even if I did have them it
would not make any difference.

You can't eat.

You're not alive.

Ain't that the
understatement of the century.


Oh.
Drink.

Drink it.

So I'm dead.

Sue me.

Who's fault is it
anyway, Kunkle?

It's my fault. I
killed all of you.

You ridiculed me.

You beat me.

I couldn't take it anymore.

Ah.

Go cry to your mama.

I can't.

I killed her too.

No.

Oh, no, no.

No, it's happening again.

Thanks a hell of a lot, Kunkle.

Oh.

Oh.

You did this.

Oh.

Take a load off, Jen.

You'll be OK.

You shouldn't have
made fun of me.

You should have loved me.

I loved you.

[Theme music]

Look, honey.

I see we're having a
little bit of salad

With our dressing today.

Hey, you, lay off me, OK?

This dieting business
is bad enough as it is.

I've got to have some flavor.

You're beautiful
just the way you are.

Flatterer.

I'm going to drop 20
pounds if it kills me.

Where did you go?

Bob and I went to Louis'
Fat Boy Burgers and Fries.

Ooh.

A Fat Boy burger.

They're so good.

I'd kill for a big,
greasy Fat Boy burger.

Ah-oh.

Maybe I shouldn't have
said the dreaded F word.

No, it's my cross to bear.

I'm going to remain strong
in the face of temptation.

Ah, anything exciting
happen while I was gone?

You kidding?

Anything out of the new guy?

Not a peep.

He's a weirdo.

I know what you mean.

I tried to strike up a
conversation with him earlier.

He just stared at me.

Maybe he's just shy.

Yeah.

Maybe he's just a
backwards weirdo.

Should I ask him over?

There might be some fun in it.

If you want.

But if he asks me
out, I'm married.

You wish.

Hey, Harold.

Harold.

Yes?

Come on over here.

It's no fun eating alone.

Sure.

Ah, you've met Connie.

Ah, yes.

So how do you like
this place so far?

That's all right.

Yeah?

Well, give it a week or two.

You'll be sure to despise it.

Ignore her.

It's not too bad.

So you're new to the area, huh?

Yes.

Where from?

Ohio.

Oh, really?

I've got an aunt who lives
in Ohio, in Columbus.

Hm.


What's so funny?

Ah, nothing.

Hm, nothing.

I'm sorry.

Ah, anything
interesting in the paper?

Ah, the economy
is improving a bit.

Hey, did you guys catch
any CNN last night?

No.

Why?

They cut caught that
freak that's been killing

All of those people in Alabama.

Really?
Yep.

The bastard.

It's about time.

I hope he fries.

Did they say how
many he killed?

17.

Makes Manson look
like an upstart.

Did he say why he
cut their heads off?

Usual crap.

Space aliens poisoned my water.

Satan left a note
in my lunch box.

I say zap him and
be done with it.

What a nut.

How could you behead
another human being?

Can you imagine that?

Excuse me.

I have to use the restroom.


Well, I'll say
one thing for him,

He's certainly an odd bird.

He's a weirdo.

Probably killed his
mom with a hatchet.

Hey, look.

It's Mr. Nerd.

Hi, Mr. Nerd.

How was work, Mr. Nerd?

I have to go.

Excuse me.

Excuse you?
Why?

Did you burp?


Look at that tie.

Look at him.

Emily Dickinson was born in
Amherst, Massachusetts in 1830.

Miss Dickinson was
educated at Amherst Academy

And she also attended
Mount Holyoke.

I think that it's Holyoke.

The female seminary.

Miss Dickinson's family had
been New England residents

For a number of years, thus,
their upbringing was highly

Religious and Puritanical.

Miss Dickinson's supposedly
lived a happy, active, young

Life, however, many
accounts report

That she soon
suffered an extremely

Deep romantic disappointment.

This deep disappointment
may have caused

Her to withdraw from society.

She thereafter became
a reclusive spinster.

Her poetry is highly
personal and extremely vivid,

Utilizing such themes as
death, love, and eternal life.

Miss Dickinson died in 1886
and her first published work,

"Poems," was
released posthumously

Seven years later in the 1893.

"Poems, Second Series,"
was released in 1890...

Excuse me, Mr. Reynolds.

Yes, Thelma.

Sorry to interrupt, but
"Poems" was in 1890, not 1893.

"Poems, The Second Series,"
was then released in 1891.

Just thought that you
would like to know.

Thank you, Thelma.

I certainly trust your work.

This source is obviously
a bit fuzzy on the dates.

You're quite the
Dickinson fan, aren't you?

Oh, yes.

I just adore her work.

She's a personal
heroine of mine.

Well, that is certainly
refreshing to hear.

She probably has lesbian
fantasies about her.


Well, Mr. Stone, I
see that something has

Tickled your funny bone today.

Yes, sir.

It sure is.

Well, perhaps you would
be gracious enough to share

This apparently priceless gag.

Would all of you like to be
entertained by Mr. Stone?


There you are.

Please, favor us with your
wit, Jimbo, by popular demand.

Well sir, I don't think
you'd find this particular gag

All that funny.

Try me.

Well, Matt here was
saying that Thelma probably

Has some sort of a
romantic attraction

To this Dickinson lady.


Ah, that's all, sir.

That's all, eh?

Well, Mr. Stone, since
you and Mr. Douglas

Are so taken with Emily
Dickinson's personal life,

Well, I'm certain
that the two of you

Won't object to the execution
of a 20-page paper on Miss

Dickinson's personal life.

20 pages?

Typed.

Single spaced.

Enjoy.

That's all for today.

Read Chapter 9 in the green book
and Chapter 4 in the hardback.

And Mr. Baldwin, do try
to get some sleep tonight.

I know that it's quite
important for you to rock hard,

But your snoring is
quite a distraction.

Thanks a lot.

But I didn't do anything.

Bitch.

Don't cry to teacher, Four
Eyes, or I'll kick your ass.


Pure ugly.

HAROLD (VOICEOVER): Like an
old record stuck on a groove,

My wretched existence continues.

I eat.

I work.

I eat.

I sleep.

I eat.

I work.

I eat, then I sleep again.

Life remains uneventful
and unfulfilling.

It lacks flavor.

I find myself more
alienated than ever before.

I am truly alone in the world.

Life hates me, but that's OK.

I hate life.

Grim specters of the past
continue to haunt me.

I try to ignore them.

I must forget the past, but how
can I when I have no future?

I have come to a decision.

If things don't change soon,
I'm going to kill myself.

THELMA (VOICEOVER): Dear
diary, life is hell.

In my last entry,
I shortsightedly

Concluded that my
social status at school

Could not get any lower.

I was sorely mistaken.

A well-intentioned
bystander apparently

Informed Mr. Reynolds about
the confrontation at my locker.

He'd get the five
of us after class.

He was highly irate.

They each received a
two-week detention.

Needless to say, they
were quite distressed.

I didn't want him to do it.

I knew that they would think
that I had told on them.

I don't know what to do.

My mother and father
are still vacationing

And they won't be
back for three weeks.

I know that Mr.
Reynolds meant well,

But I truly wish that he
would have ignored the matter.

I live in fear of the
inevitable reprisals.

I hate them.

I wish they would die.

I am seriously
contemplating suicide.

[Organ music playing]

Loneliness is an experience
to which all of us

As God's children can relate.

On the subject of loneliness,
the great Anglican theologian

CS Lewis once wrote
the following words.

"We are born helpless."

As soon as we are
fully conscious,

We discover loneliness.

We need others, physically,
emotionally, intellectually.

"We need them if we are to know
anything, even ourselves."

And so by the time
we are but infants,

We seek to be in relationship,
with our parents, our families,

With God, and with each other.

It has been said that
Christianity is not a religion,

But a relationship and
there is no such thing

As a solitary Christian.

Yes, Mother, we made a date.

Well, I'm certain that
he's a gentleman, Mother.

Yes.

He's a data processor.

He seems very intelligent
and well mannered.

Oh, Mother, I'll be fine.

I have a first date
sooner or later.

Hello, Thelma.

I brought you these.

Oh, they're beautiful, Harold.

Come on in.

Oh, thank you, Harold.

I'll put them in a vase.

They're wonderful.

How was work today?

Ah, fine.

Thank you.

School was trying
today as always.

Things aren't easy unless
you're a... a football

Hero or a... a cheerleader.

I'm sure you can empathize.

Yes, I know the feeling.

Academics just aren't
emphasized enough.

No wonder the illiteracy
rate is so high.

Ooh, there.

Ooh, they're marvelous.

No one has ever given
me flowers before.

That was sweet, Harold.

Thanks again.

Ah, beautiful women should
have beautiful things.

I think I heard it
in a movie once.

Oh, thank you.

That's a lovely thing to say.

Where would you like to go?

Ah, where would you like to go?

Oh, anywhere is fine, Harold.

Well, there's a
comic book convention

Going on at the hotel at I-64.

We could go there if you
want, unless you'd rather not.

Oh, that would be fine, Harold.

So do you enjoy
reading comic books?

Yes, I'm a collector.

Oh, I've never
read them before,

But it sounds interesting.

[Music - "oh my sweet princess"]

HAROLD (VOICEOVER):
At last, I have

Found someone, someone like me.

I've never been happier.

THELMA (VOICEOVER): I
still cannot believe it.

My heart is literally
bursting with joy.

After a lifetime of
romantic yearnings,

I finally find him,
someone like me.

I'm in love.

Oh, man.

I don't feel like going in.

Let's skip for the day.

I'm game if you are.

How about it?

Start the big bash early.

No, I can't.

Old man Reynolds passed
by a couple of minutes ago.

He'll know we were cutting.

Yeah, and the last thing we
need is another detention.

Reynolds has got it
in for all four of us.

Ah, it ain't his fault he's
your standard asshole teacher.

He's just doing his job.

It's the nark's fault.

Nasty old nerd woman.

Fugly old nerd woman.

That bitch.
Yeah.

Maybe we should stick
a tampon up her ass.


Your old man leave his Jeep?

Yep.

It's ours till Monday.

Good.

We're going to need
it to haul the kegs.

I can taste that brew now.

I'm gonna drink until I...

What's wrong?

I can't believe it.

Fugly found another fugly.

I got an idea.

You guys up for some special
entertainment at the party

Tonight?


Thelma.

Hi.

Look, if you're
here to harass me...

No, really.

We're sorry about all that.

Yeah.

Really sorry.

It was Reynolds who gave
us the detention, not you.

And well, you know, we
probably deserved it.

I didn't tell on you.

If I were a snitch,
I'd have informed

On you when you shoved me down.

Obviously, I didn't.

Well, let's just call it a
big misunderstandings, huh?

We're here to make good.

We really want to
bury the hatchet.

Honest.

Well, I guess grudge
holding is pretty

Unconstructive
especially if it was

Just a slight misunderstanding.

Well, I sure feel better now.

We felt awfully bad.

I feel better too.

I know I don't have very
much in common with you

Two or anyone else in the
school for that matter,

But I hate conflicts.

Well hey, we just
have to get to know

Each other a little bit better.

That's all.

But we've been in school
together for nearly four years.

Why all of a sudden...

Look, everybody has to
grow up sometime, right?

Well, we're going to
be graduating soon.

Let's just say it's our turn
to do a little maturing.

OK.

We'll let bygones be bygones.

Hey.

Matt's parents are out
of town and he's having

A really big party tonight.

Why don't you stop by?

Oh, I don't know.

I already made plans
with my boyfriend.

Oh, so you have a boyfriend.

Well, why don't you
bring him along too.

I don't know, Harold.

They certainly seemed sincere.

Ah, I don't know either.

This sudden repentance
seems a bit suspect.

I suppose so.

Oh, but it would be so
nice if it were genuine.

I've been in these
situations before.

Besides, they probably
want to ridicule us.

I don't think so, Harold.

Oh, I'm so happy now
that I'm with you.

I think that they
can sense that.

And it is the end
of high school.

I'd so love to have
it end on a good note.

Yes.

Yes.

We can go.

We could always go home early.

Oh, wonderful.

Oh, thank you, Harold.

I'm so excited.

The... the party starts at 10:00,
but maybe we should be... oh,

What do the hip people call it?

Fashionably late.

Sure.

So pick me up around 11:00.

Oh, I can't wait
to show you off.

Great.

See you at 11:00 then.

Oh, wonderful.

I love you, Harold.

I love you too.

Good bye.

the telephone is ringing.

Turns up the radio and
pretends that he's singing.

Another tune comes on and
says, dang, it's Elvis.

Jumps up like a
hound dog, starts

Shaking his pelvis around.

She don't even
care. [Inaudible].

Pulls on her high-heal shoes
and rolls up her stockings.

Shakes a lollipop right out
of her pocket, unwraps it,

Licks it once and
then she starts

To suck it, suck it, suck it.

Go ahead oh, minute man, say I
can't understand why things are

Happening, why things are
happening, so I don't even try,

Don't stop to wonder why when
she says she's going home.

So then he gives lip to me.

That was his first mistake.

The second mistake was when he
thought he could take me down.

I mean, can you
believe this guy?

Of course, I'm too
quick for his sorry ass.

I block his punch,
then I pop him one.

I think that I broke his nose.

He's lucky I didn't
break his neck.

Nah, I was there.

It wasn't that way at all.

Man.

Come on, nothing.

You're full of shit.

He hit you.

You hit the ground.

Why you gotta dog me, man?

I gotta talk trash.

You calling me a liar?

Ah, man.

Come on, man.

Cool out.

I ain't no liar.

I'm just talking.

You're full of shit, man.

You're an asshole.


Damn straight.

Cause I'm gonna kick
your lying, candy ass.


Ah, Ah, Ah.

Ah, Ah, Ah.

So are you gonna
spend the night?

I'd like to.

I want to if I can.

I'll call home around midnight.

I'll tell my parents
I'm staying at Marzie's.

Of course, she'll
tell her parents

She's staying at my house.

But you'll both be
here, wantonly engaging

In reckless, premarital sex.

You got it.

why things are happening,

Why things are happening.

So I don't even try,
don't stop to wonder why,


We were going to scrap
and all, but I let him go.

He's drunk.

I'm feeling mighty
generous tonight.

You're looking very
hot this evening.

What do say we blow this
Popsicle stand and...

[Doorbell rings]

Door bell.

Screw them.

Am I the gatekeeper?

How's about you and
I taking a little...

[Doorbell rings]

You'd better get it.

I don't think anyone
else can hear it.

Ah, man.

[Doorbell rings]

Enough already.

Hello.

Is this Matt Douglas' house?

We're here for the party.

Hiya, Thelma.

Hello.

Hiya, Thel.

Hello, Jimbo.

So I take it this is your
so called significant other.

It certainly is.

He's the light of my life.

Oh.

How sweet.

Harold, this is Marzie.

Hiya.

Please to meet
your acquaintance.

And this is Jimbo.

How ya doin' man?

Fine.

Nice to meet you.

Let's go upstairs
to freshen up.

Harold, I'll be right back.

Say, Harold, do
you like to drink?

Oh, it was nice of
you to ask us to come.

Oh, sure.

Oh.

Hi, Thelma.

Hello.

Oh, you look nice.

Thanks.

I'm a little tipsy.

My eyes are probably blood shot.

Oh, no.

You both look wonderful.

Ah, you're sweet.

I wish I was pretty.

I know that I'm not.

Ooh, I wouldn't say that.

Yeah.

You ain't that homely.

You just need a little
jazzing up, that's all.

But my hair is horrible.

My... it isn't that great either.

I've accepted it.

I am homely.

A little makeup can do wonders,
even for a bad complexion.

And why do you think
God invented extra body

Gel and styling spritz.

I... I appreciate
the interest, but I

Never use those vanity things.

I wouldn't know where to start.

Hey, that's what
friends are for.

Marz, get your purse.

Whew.

I'm going to give you
the makeover of your life.

No.

Now, you... you don't have to.

No, we don't, but we want to.

Oh, but I'd feel bad.

Harold is down there by
himself and he's really shy.

Oh, don't worry about him.

He's a big boy.

I'm sure Matt and Jimbo
will take good care of him.


Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!
Aw!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Whew!

Man...


Whew!

There's more where
that came from.


Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!
Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Slam it!

Ooh, it sounds like they're
having a grand time downstairs.

Yeah, but not nearly as much
fun as we are having up here.

Oh, yes.

We're coming along just fine.


Well, I must say, we've
certainly outdone ourselves.

Yeah.

A regular work of art.

Oh, I'm so excited.

Do you have a mirror?

Ah, no.

But there's one downstairs
in the living room.

Yeah.

You'll surprise your
boyfriend on the way.

Wonderful.

I hope that he
notices the change.

Oh, believe me, he'll notice.


Wonderful pig feet.

I'd really like to thank
you for inviting us.

I feel like I really belong.

Oh, think nothing of it.

It was our pleasure.

You like me.

You really like me.


Stop it!


What's so funny?


What's so funny?

Take a look in
the mirror, Fugly.

We buried the
hatchet, all right.

Yeah.

Right through her ugly head.


Ah.

I feel sick.

I'm sorry, Harold.

It's my fault. You
warned me but, no, I

Was the foolish
optimist, always the

Idealistic, foolish optimist.

Something's wrong with me.

I see red.

Do you like it?

I got one of the red bulbs
from my father's dark room.

Red suits my mood this evening.

It's my new favorite color.

Red is the color of blood,
the color of revenge.

I don't understand.

Of all people, you should know.

What do you mean by that?

You talk in your sleep, dear.

The ones who picked on you,
the ones who ridiculed you,

You killed them.

I know all about it.

Please.

I don't know what you're...

I'm not going to tell on you.

I love you, now and forever.

Let me explain.

You don't need to
explain, my love.

I'm proud of you.

I'm glad that you did it.

And you're going to do it again.

No.

Yes, you are.

And I'm going to help you.

Now, I want to know
all the details.

Tell me how you did it.

Tell me how you murdered them.

Johnny, nothing
below the waist.

Oh, come on, Frankie.

We've already done
everything but.

Well, I just don't want you to
think I'm some sort of sleaze.

I don't like to go all the way
until at least the third date.

Look, look, last Friday night
we were both at the victory

Dance, right?

Ooh, yeah.

And we slow danced
together, right?

Yeah, I guess so.

And then Saturday,
we were at Muzzy

Lake drinking with the gang.

Right?

Yeah, but we weren't
really together.

Yeah.

Sure we were.

So technically speaking,
that was a date too.

I guess it could have been.

OK.

So again, technically
speaking, that would make this

Our third date, right?

M-m.

Well, I have to think about it.

OK.

But make sure you pull
out before you do it.

Hey, no problem.

I believe in safe sex too.

[Pebble sounds]

What the hell.

Sounds like hale.

Hale my ass.

Someone's throwing rocks.

It's that asshole Tom Birch.

I'll have my foot
so far up his ass,

He'll be tasting shoe leather.

I'll show you at the court.

Bare you for ornaments
where women breathe.

That every sigh may lift you
just as high as I and when

I die, I make a
way to sleigh you,

Still to show how rich I go.

The skies in peach and
wealth so wonderful.

And banish me.

Oh.

Hello, Johnny.

Fancy meeting you here.

Welcome to hell.

Man, you are one weird bitch.

Ah!

We've known each
other for a long time,

Ever since elementary school.

You've never been civil to me.

Hey... hey come on.

Do you remember the
eighth grade band banquet?

What you called me in
front of every one?

Mother and Father thought
I was too young to shave

My legs and armpits.

I couldn't help it.

They wouldn't let me.

We were at the banquet.

Everything was quiet.

Then you shouted, Hap, H-A-P,
short for hairy armpits,

In front of everyone.

Everyone laughed.

I cried.

But that wasn't enough for you.

You threw disposable razors
at me in front of everyone.

But hey, I'm willing to
let bygones be bygones.


Hey.

I'm going to give you
your just desserts.

I always wanted to know
what oral sex was like.

I don't have the gag
reflexes like you.

No.

Oh, god.

Stop.

Please.

Freak bitch.

Easy.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I must have done it wrong.

Ah!

Harold, shush him.

Splendidly done, Harold.

What you did, did you enjoy it?

Oh, Harold, you're jealous.

Don't worry, you're much bigger.


Men, who needs 'em?

always Mr. Hand.

Ooh.

Ah.

M-m.

Ah.


Caught you with your
hand in the cookie jar.

Thelma.

You're nothing but a stupid,
danged, air-headed fluff chick.

You think you're so pretty.

You with your big
breasts and clear skin,

You probably never
even had a zit.

I'm going to slice you up.

No.

No!

And then, I'm
going to pee on you.



Hey.

Hey.

Hey!


The old bitch from
next door just called.

She got pissed about the
noise and she called the cops.

Bull shit!

Come on.

We gotta clear out of here.

Oh, man.

I just bought a whole
bottle of vodka.

We'll drink it later.

I'm just getting
comfortable, man.

Let's go.

Boo.

Damn.


Don't do that.

Oh, what's the matter, did
I frighten the little man?

Look.

That's not a corpse,
that's Tom Birch.

He passed out about an hour ago.

Not dead, unfortunately,
just wasted.

Scared the hell outta me.

For a minute there,
I thought those nerds

Came back for revenge.

Oh, that'll be the day.

Matt, I told Rachael she
could spend the night, OK?

What the hell.

The more, the merrier.

We've already got
one uninvited guest.

Great.

She's taking a shower.


Whew, whew, whew.



You're an asshole.

It was just a joke.

Asshole.

I thought you were KO-ed.

I was.

I got better.

Well, I don't care if
you spend the night.

I do.

Just keep it down, OK?

No problem.

You're a great guy, Matt.

Whatever.

I'm going to bed.

By the way, you've
got a nice beaver.

MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): [inaudible].

I don't know Mrs. Johnson.

MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): [inaudible].

Yes.

Lucy was at the party,
but she left with Jack

Walker and another couple.

MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): Jack Walker?

What do you think
they're doing now?

Calm down, Mrs. Johnson.

MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE):
Was there drinking?

Oh, no.

There was no booze at the party.

MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): And
they probably had some pot.

No.

No pot either.

Look, lady, I don't need...

What's wrong?

That's weird.

The phone went dead.


I hate that Dick.

Everyone hates Tom.

Then what's he doing here?

Matt's too nice of a guy.

He can't say no.

Hurry up and finish.

I'm drunk and I'm horny.

You're always horny.

Beer makes me horny.

Let's go to bed.

Maybe we won't be
disturbed this time.

We'd better not be
disturbed or that Tom

Birch is going to be one
sorry... was that the front door?

Maybe Matt's
putting his cat out.

Let's go to bed.

All right.

All right.

But I forewarn you, I may
be too drunk to get it up.

Tom?

Don't you ever
learn, little boy?

You deserve a good,
swift kick in the balls.



There he goes again.

I should have known
better than to let Birch

The butt hole spend the night.


By the way, you've
got nice beaver.

Hi, honey.

I'm home.

Where's the Beaver?


Ward, you were a little
hard in my beaver last night.


All right, asshole.

Once just wasn't enough, was it?

Huh?

Man, what are you talking about?

You know goddamned well
what I'm talking about, man.

I heard you laughing
like a goon upstairs.

Look, I'm warning you,
you leave Rachael alone.

Man, I don't know where
you're coming from.

Look, I... I'll
spell it out for you.

I don't like you.

Nobody likes you.

You're slimy, whiny
little jerk off

And if I catch you bugging her
again, your ass is grassed.

Do I make myself clear?

Yeah.

Sure.

Whatever.

Do I need to elaborate?

I think I get the general idea
of what you're trying to say.

Good.

See that you do.

What is this, pick
on Tom Birch night?

Damn.

Big Shit is lucky I
didn't pop him one.

Might as well make myself
at home, especially

Since I'm so well liked.

Well, they can all
hang for all I care.

Ouch.

Dear Stud, you are totally hot.

I've been playing hard
to get, but a girl has

To do what a girl has to do.

Come upstairs right now
for some hot booty love?

I'm in the room
with the water bed.

Lets start some waves?

Love, Rachael.

I knew she wanted me.

Hey, Rachael.

Come on in, big boy.

I see that you got my note.

You know it, babe.

I was naked, but I didn't
want to get you too excited

All at once.

So I found a special
dress in the closet.

I thought that you
could slowly strip me.

Would you like to
take off my dress?

Would I?

You'd probably like to massage
my breasts too, wouldn't you?

Sure.

Then come here.

Make me wet.

I hope that you like
my special dress.

Don't worry, babe, it
ain't going to be on long.

Do you like it?

It's a wedding dress.

The year book voted me most
likely to never get married

And you were the editor.

Hey, you ain't Rachael.

You're that fugly nerd.

You know, Tom, you
really are an asshole.

Get him, Harold!

Get him!

Get him!


Oh.

What was that?

I don't know.

Oh, shit.

I forgot to take
out my contacts.

Ah, they're stuck to my eyes.

I'm going to have
to get some saline.

Hurry up.

Hey, this isn't the bathroom.

[Muffled sounds]

Set her down over there.

Tie her nice and tight, Harold.

It wouldn't do if I should
slip while I'm giving

Her her nice, new haircut.

Marz?

Marz?

Thirsty.

Oh, that's much better.

Doesn't she look
wonderful, Harold?

Oh, she looks lovely.

I must say, it's a
definite improvement.

Voila, Madam.

Aw, she does not lie her new do.

Well, I guess I did
miss a few spots,

But I know just the
thing to clean her up.

Wait here.

Skin head.

Ha.

Would you like
to do the honors?

No.

No.

I could... I would
hate to infringe

On your consortial talent.

Oh.

All right, I'll
finish her up then.

Well, Marzie, it
looks like we're going

To bury the hatchet after all.

Whew, look at the blood.

Oh, so pretty and red.

That asshole, Birch.

He's probably busy
looting the place.

I knew it.

All right, Birch, you
better have hands clean.

Otherwise, it's judgment day.

Kill him, Harold.

And I'll finish
off the other two.


Die!

Die!

Die!

Die!


Get back here, you bitch.

[Sparring sounds]


I've always been envious
of your big, breasts.

I'm going to lop them off.

Then I'm going to
stuff them in my bra.

I'll have big titties too.


That's right, you moron.

That's exactly where I want you.

Eh!


Eh!

[Choking sounds]

[Grunting sounds]

Hello.

Avon calling.

Eat shit, Avon lady.


Ow!

Ow!

No.

No.

You wouldn't.

Fry, you fugly bitch.



It is a special day after
all, so I made your favorite.

That's right.

It's spaghetti.

I'm certain that
you're surprised.

You have to clean your plate.

You're starting to lose weight.

I have another surprise.

I'll be right back.

Surprise.

That's right.

We're having wine.

Can I help it if I'm
a hopeless romantic?

Happy birthday.

I love you, Thelma.
