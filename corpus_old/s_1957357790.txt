Arliss: For most of us,

the dream of becoming a champion

remains a fantasy.

But for a special few,

it is very much a reality.

We cheer them.

We live through them.

Athletes are our last warriors.

My job is to make
their dreams come true.

â™ª â™ª

My name is Arliss Michaels.

I represent athletes.

These are my stories.

â™ª I don't know what it is
that makes me love you so â™ª

â™ª I only know I never
wanna let you go â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you started something â™ª

â™ª Oh, can't you see â™ª

â™ª That ever since we met â™ª

â™ª You had a hold on me â™ª

â™ª It happens to be true â™ª

â™ª I only wanna be with you â™ª

â™ª And I just wanna be
beside you everywhere â™ª

â™ª As long as we're together â™ª

â™ª Honey, I don't care â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you started something â™ª

â™ª Oh, can't you see â™ª

â™ª That ever since we met â™ª

â™ª You had a hold on me â™ª

â™ª No matter what you do â™ª

â™ª I only wanna be with you â™ª

Announcer: And as they
come out of the Clubhouse turn,

it's First-to-Third
and Henry's Legion

fighting for the lead.

First-to-Third! First-to-Third!

(crowd shouting)

First-to-Third! First-to-Third!

To Fourth.

To Fifth...

To hell with you.
Yes! Yes!

Hoo hoo! (kiss)

Thank you! Woo!

What are you so jolly about?

First-to-Third just finished

on the other side of the
International Date Line.

I know. I-I had
Henry's Legion to win.

You what!?

Look, boss, I know I'm the one

that talked you into
buying First-to-Third,

but, you know, maybe it's time

that horse got another job,

like keeping model
airplanes together.

What's with your lip?

Oh. This is love, Arliss.

Looks like a canker.

No, it's love.

I don't wanna know.
She's a prizefighter.

Oh, now I really
don't wanna hear it.

Kirby, I am not
representing a woman boxer.

No, this isn't business.
This is all pleasure.

I'm in love.
This is ugly.

No, this is the real thing.

And the sex?

Oh, man. You know what
it's like to be in the sack

with someone that can
put together combinations?

Hoo hoo!

("Chinatown" theme plays)

Kirby, look! Look!

Arliss: Is that
who I think it is?

Kirby: The Rock?

Yeah. See him out
here all the time.

That's Rocky Framaggio!

Rocky Framaggio! The Big Cheese!

He was my idol when
I was growing up!

I used to wear the same
uniform number as him, nine.

I used to stand in the
batter's box like him.

I'd hitch up my belt like him.

I'd hold the bat up high.

I mean, I'd waggle it like him.

He was my guy! That's
Rocky Fra... Wha...

(crowd murmuring)

Where'd he go?

Try the bar.

â™ª â™ª

I'll see you later.
Alright, take it light.

Arliss: In sport, many
are referred to as stars.

But then, there is the one

who becomes part
of your own history.

The one who stands
out amongst the many.

So, I cut the ball
off at the gap,

Brock rounds first,
makes a big turn,

but he knows I got a cannon.

So, he just stands
there, daring me to throw.

Meanwhile,
Javier, he's on third.

He decides to bolt for home.

Well, I, I know I can't get him

'cause I fucked up
staring down Brock.

But I see McCarver
daydreaming at second,

at second, so I throw a BB,

I pick his ass off second
before the run scores,

we win game three.

-(laughs) -It was a great
play! I was at that game.

You and 8,000,000 others.

Uh, bartender? Um, go ahead.

â™ª â™ª

I hope you don't mind.

You think I'm gonna turn
you down, you're wrong.

I'd be insulted if you did!

After all the years of
pleasure you gave me...

Was that you?

I'm sorry. I just slipped
out the next morning.

I was gonna call you,
but I forgot your number.

-(laugh) That's very funny.
-(laugh)

I'm Arliss Michaels.

I mean, I... I
gotta tell you, um,

I deal with a lot of superstars

in my line of work, but I,

I can't tell you what a great
thrill this is meeting you.

In fact, check this out.

Your rookie card.

Oh yeah. He looks familiar.

Um...

Would you, uh...

sign this for me?

Cost you 50 bucks.


(drops pen)

Carlos!

Same.

What are you having?

Uh, can I have a
decaffeinated latte, please?

With bourbon.


September 22nd, 1963.

Metropolitan Stadium, Minnesota.

Camilo Pascual's
right on the mound.

He throws me a
forkball middle in, but,

see, I'm looking for it
because he'd already

struck me out twice
with breaking balls,

so... (laughs)

Anyway, I get
all of it this time.

I can feel it down to my spikes,

and the ball comes off the bat,

it's heading for
Canada. (chuckles)

Number 500...

I was at that game, too.

Yeah, you and 80,000,000 others.

Man, those were glory days.

Remember, you owned that town!


Kid, back then, we
partied so hard, I...


I couldn't remember my birthday.

I, I tell you w-what I
do remember, though.

Two ex-wives, and...

two paternity suits to
help cause the ex-wives.

Oh yeah, and Rocky's
Fried Chicken chain

that went belly-up.

Oh, I loved that chicken!

Ah, it had the greatest slogan!
Yeah...

"To get a better
piece of chicken,

Both: You'd have
to be a rooster!"


So, Mr. Agent Man,

uh, got any use for a...

washed up, 14-handicap
Hall of Famer? (chuckles)

I gotta make a little
jack, you know?

Are you serious?

I'd be honored to represent you.

I mean, don't worry.


Selling you. Once
a thoroughbred,

always a thoroughbred.

I can't wait to get into the
office tomorrow and say...

People, we are in the
Rocky Framaggio business.

I thought he was dead.

No, he just looks that way.

What happened to all his money?

He's been investing in taverns.

You know, one drink at a time.


Arliss: Excuse me, excuse me.

People, I will not sit here,

and let you denigrate
a three time MVP,

first ballot Hall of Famer,

with a .317 batting
average, 508 home runs,

and 1,345 RBIs.

Mays was better.

Bullshit! If The Rock hadn't
blown out his shoulder,

he woulda blown away
all of Mays' records!

If Mays hadn't played
in Candlestick Park...

Oh, gimme a break! If my aunt
had balls, she'd be my uncle!

Kirby, Kirby! Who was
better, Mays or Framaggio?

Mantle.

Anyway, I've invited The Rock

to come over here and
meet all of us this afternoon.

Oh no, I can't
meet anyone today.

I'm going to go take my friend

to her egg extraction.

Her what?

Well, see, my friend's
having problems conceiving,

and so she's gonna
get her eggs collected,

and then artificially seminated.

fine, fine, fine.

If you wanna go to an egg
hunt rather than meeting

the greatest ball player
of our generation...

Second best.

Boss, what makes you
think you're gonna take a guy

that struck out 3,000
times on the field,

and 4,000 times off
it, and get him work?

Just as there are
teflon politicians,

there are also teflon athletes.

The Rock happens
to be one of 'em.

In fact, I've already
lined up not one,

not two, but three

job offers.

(organ plays "Charge")

Thanks for the audition, Dick.

Hey, anything for The Rock.

Ah, he appreciates it, too.
Yeah, no problem.

Okay, Rock,

here's the way
this is gonna work.

You follow the
action on the monitor,

I'll do the play-by-play,

you do the color commentary

with some interesting anecdotes.

It's that simple.

You know, I'm, I'm
a little nervous, guys,

'cause I don't really relate
to today's ballplayers.

Both: Don't worry about
that. Don't worry about it...

The key here, the
key here, Rock, just...

Both: Be yourself.

Dick: Just be yourself.

That's the best way to do it.

Let's try one, and let's roll.

He's gonna be great.
Okay.

Glassine pitches to Hundley,

and it's a line drive to
left field for a base hit.

Gilkey rounds third,
heading for home.

Here's Klesko's
throw. Gilkey slides,

and he's out at the plate!

That was a great
throw by Klesko!

You had a great arm!

Well, thanks, but, uh,

my arm was much
stronger than fat boy here.

when I picked McCarver's ass

off second in the Series?

See, I was playing right field,

and Brock hit a single,
and I threw behind him...

Well, you had a great arm,
Rock, no question about it.

But, the way Klesko is hitting,

someday he may approach
some of your records.

Well, sure, but that's because
today's pitching's for shit.

See, first of all,

they bring these
kids up to the bigs

before their nuts have dropped.

And then, these aluminum
bats are for pussies.

And, worst of all,

the strike zone
is a fucking joke.

There are these
band-box ballparks, and...

L-Look at this guy.

I mean, h-he makes
3,000,000 dollars,

he's, he's not even running!

Come on!

Run, you fucking mook!

(organ plays "Charge")

(crowd murmuring)

What did I tell you?
Look at those lines!

Yeah, look at it.
It's not even moving.

He's been here two
hours, signed six cards,

and taken seven breaks!

Eh, it just takes him a
little while to get going.

Thanks.
(sigh)

Hey, Rock. I told my
son you were my idol.

He's heard every
story about you.

Son, say hello to Rock.

Hello, Rock.

Hi, son.

Now remember,

stay in school, stay off drugs.


Look at that kid's face.

Yeah, look at him!

If he breathes on him again,

he'll turn to stone!

Baseball misses you, Rock.

When are you gonna
get back into the game?

Not interested.

Can't relate to today's players.

I told my son about every
home run you ever hit.

I even told him about the time

you hit a buck 98
in the '63 series.

Remember your last time at bat?

"The whiff heard around
the world." Remember that?


What's that say?

It says,

"Kiss my ass, Dad."

That's it. I gotta take a break.

Another break?
He just took a break!

Oh, it's his hand.

He's got that thing where
he can't sign autographs.

That, uh, Lincoln
Tunnel Syndrome!

He doesn't have a problem
picking up a beer bottle!

I can't take this
anymore, Arliss. Come on,

I think we can still make
the fifth race at Santa Anita.

â™ª â™ª

He's supposed to
sign for five hours!

He's only been here for two!

Sorry, Arliss. I guess
I dropped the ball.

Uh, that's okay. The
next one's a can't miss.

(organ plays "Charge")

â™ª â™ª

Welcome to Ferullo's
Diamond Wheel Casino.

What'd I tell you?
What did I tell you?

That's the best I've ever seen!

Great grip, and you
look at that eye contact!

Welcome to Ferullo's
Diamond Wheel Casino.

Ferullo: That's the
best I've ever seen, eh?

The best!
The best!

Hey, hey! Look who's here!

You're doing
great, he loves you.

Keep it up! Keep it up!

Hey, Rock!

I want you to meet one
of our most loyal patrons.

Rock, Howie Rosenberg.

Welcome to Ferullo's
Diamond Wheel Casino.

Hey, Rock... Do me a favor.

I got a girl I wanna impress.
When I bring her over,

pretend we're old friends.

You know, like golfing
buddies or something. Huh?

Uh...

Sure, sure. Why not?

Thanks.

(both chuckle)

Good job, Rock.

That personal touch.
That always helps, huh?

Hey, Arliss! Come
on, I'll buy you a drink.

You're doing great. Keep
it up, and no, uh, drinking...

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Oh! Hey, Rock!

Good to see you again.

Honey, meet an old pal of mine,

Rocky Framaggio!

Nice to meet you.

Welcome to Ferullo's
Diamond Wheel Casino.

Rocky and I go back

a long way together, right?

Don't we, Rock?

advice all the time

on how he was
dropping his shoulder,

opening up too much.

Whatever you say, Howie.

investments, huh?

That stupid chicken chain?

Oh, whoa, was
that a stupid idea!

(both laughing)

And those bimbos you married?

Rock! What were you thinking?


and worst of all...

the money you cost me in '63,

when you struck out
with the bases loaded

to end the Series? Ho boy,

did you look bad out there.


That's right, I struck
out to end the Series.

But, you know what it's
like, don't you, Howie?

Standing in the batter's
box on bad knees,

trying to hit a 99
mile an hour fastball,

with a shoulder that keeps
popping out of the socket?

Oh, I forgot!

You never played
the game, did you?

You just like to sit
back and criticize

and be a big shot.

Guys like you piss me off

'cause you don't know jack shit.

Seem to be getting along well.

He's good, See, Howie's
one of our best customers.

Well, what did I tell you?

Pardon my French, ma'am.

I don't mean to embarrass

a fine woman like yourself,

but I think you should know that

your friend here is
what we used to call

in the big leagues,

"A fucking asshole."


Rock's always kidding.

I'm not kidding, zoo breath.

Why don't you get rid of that
stupid divot on your head?

Hair of the dog, huh?

Ah!

Howie!

Get your sorry ass outta here!

â™ª â™ª

He went 0 for three.

What am I gonna do?

The man couldn't hold onto a job

where all he had to
do was sign his name.

The man couldn't hold onto a job

where all he had to
do was shake hands.

Arliss, just let him go.

You don't understand
what this guy means to me.

(phone rings)

Arliss Michaels' office.

Oh, yeah, okay. Kirby.


Yeah, Kirby.

Yeah, I just got a
call from the stables,

and, um, Mac needs
to see you right away.

What, did Elmer's
finally make an offer?

I don't know. I'm just...

I'm just telling you
what he told me.

Fine. I'm on my way.


Rita, call Dr. Kevorkian.

See if he's got an opening
for me this afternoon.


You know, uh, honey?

It's been, uh, over a week,

since we've gone
a couple rounds.


I'm in training.

I got a fight in two weeks.

Two weeks!?


So, drop it!

Two weeks?

(horse snorts)

Looks like old-fashioned
arthritis to me.

I think the salad days
of First-to-Third are over.

Salad days?

We never got to the,

"Can I get you something
from the bar?" days!

I got a friend up in Oxnard
who has a stud ranch up there.

He'll pay a good fee
for a stallion like this.

They have ranches
that breed losers?

Sure.

It's all about bloodlines.

First-to-Third is fourth-removed

from the second cousin

of the grandson of Secretariat.

They'll extract his
semen in the hope that

the offspring will have
greatness in his genes.

People will pay a
lot of money for this.


Once a thoroughbred,

always a thoroughbred.

â™ª â™ª

No...

Why not?

Why the hell not?


As we close out
the final few seconds

on our autographed baseball,

let's move onto our next item,

which is most unique.

Look at that beautifully

handcrafted collector's item.

What's inside?

I'll let my next two
guests explain that.

With me, a man who
needs no introduction.

Wait, maybe he does.

Batting clean-up, number nine,

Mr. Rocky Framaggio,

and his agent,

Mr. Arliss Michaels.

Welcome.

Thank you, Nan.

As you know, The Rock
has always been synonymous

with the American dream.

Well, inside that cup

is the stuff that
dreams are made of.

Frozen in liquid nitrogen,

at minus 320 degrees.

Yes, Rocky Framaggio, The Rock,

can be the father
of your next child.

Now, technology
keeps the sperm frozen,

or is the correct word viable?

That's what they
tell me. I just jerk off.

Actually (laughs), there's
a lot more to it than that.

Oh, I can see that we're getting

quite a response already.

I'm curious, how
did the two of you

hit upon such a wonderful idea?

I wanted to give
something back to the fans,

plus it allows me to
work out of the home.

Imagine, your son

batting in the
bottom of the ninth,

with the bases loaded,

with this man's blood

pumping through his veins.

Like I always say,

if I had a nickel for
every time I did it...

Plus, we're including
a free t-ball starter set

for the first 25 callers.

The perfect Father's Day gift.

Let's take some calls, shall we?

Hello? Joe from Medford, Oregon.

Joe: Hello.

Always been a big
fan of yours, Rock.

How safe is all this?

I'm healthy as a horse, Joe.

Arliss: All samples
are thoroughly screened

and medically certified.

Uh, Marcus from New York City.

Marcus: Yeah, listen,

I saw The Rock passed out

in a public john at Pimlico.
Is he still hitting the bot...

We're getting interference here.

Can we take another call,
please? Another call, please?

Kathy from Aurora, Illinois.

Go ahead.

Kathy: My husband
sits at the dinner table,

just staring at
his steamed peas.

I can't wait to see
the look on his face

when I surprise him
with The Rock's child!


I think this would make

a priceless anniversary present!

(alarm ringing)

Oh my, I see we've
already sold out

of this item in record time.

Callers, please, uh, just
hang up your phone...

Uh, excuse me, Nan! I'm...

getting a message from
Phil in the warehouse. What?

He says he has room
for 50 more orders!

50 more?

The response has
been overwhelming.

And I've pitched the idea to

Montana, Koufax,
Dr. J, and Jim Brown!

What a success story.

It's the great
American wet dream!

This is unbelievable.

Why?

Doesn't your friend pay
for the sperm for her in vitro?

Uh, maybe a little.

Not 5,000 dollars.

Well, maybe if she
paid a little more,

she'd give birth to a
future Hall of Famer.

that you talked

Rocky Framaggio into doing this.

Stanley: Rita...

Both: You never have
to talk men into doing this.

Here it is.

All Pac-10,

all American,

and there's plenty more
where that came from.

Ew, I don't have to be here.

Oh, just 'cause you
haven't gotten any

since the Carter administration!


I have high standards
when it comes to men.

All you need is an
inflatable doll with a pulse.

Yeah, right, that's why you
sit at home on Friday nights,

watching the Lifetime
channel with your cats!

Why does the idea of

getting pregnant without
having to deal with men

suddenly seem so appealing?

(clicks tongue)

Wait a minute...

they make 'em with pulses now?

Oh shit!

I have to call Wilt by 6:00.

â™ª â™ª

Um...

Arliss, we gotta talk.

Man to man.

Yeah, sure.

What's the matter?

You're healing pretty good.

It's the first time in a while

I haven't seen you looking
like George Chuvalo. (chuckle)


Cheetah's been training
for the Betty Clocker fight.

No sex for two weeks.

You know, and I got this
massive case of blue balls.

Yeah...

You know, I love Cheetah.

But, to tell you the truth,

I hope she gets knocked out.

What?

I mean, I-I-I don't want
her to get hurt. I just...

I hope she loses
the fight, for my sake.

You know? Because if she wins

this fight, she's liable
to get a title shot.

I mean (laughs),

I might not get any
pussy for a year!


Yeah...

Yeah, yeah.

Um...

I don't know what to tell you.

Uh...


You know, it's just...
It feels good to...

be able to talk about it.

That's what I'm here for.

(back slapping)

Do you know what
time he'll be back?

It's a rather personal matter.

Uh, could you tell him,

or whoever
represents Mr. Costner

to get in touch with Arliss
Michaels Management?

No, we're not a film management.

We represent athletes,

but we have a very interesting
proposition for Mr. Costner.

Yes.

Rita Wu.

Thank you.

What is this?
Uh, hey, that's, that's per...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Denzel Washington, Yo-Yo Ma,

George Stephanopoulos,
Tom Selleck, Jim Carrey?

My friend heard about your
service, and she thought,

why an anonymous donor?
Why not a made-to-order man?

Your friend has
quite a wish list!

Yeah, well, she tends to favor

intellectual aptitude,
taste, and talent.

Your friend?

My friend.

(phone ringing)

Arliss Michaels Management.

Yeah, one second.

It's your trainer.

Uh, schedule me a cardiovascular
workout for Thursday.

No, not your personal trainer.

Your horse trainer.

(snorts like a horse)

What?

Arliss: He's sterile!?

He sure is.

He's packing less ammo
than a conscientious objector.

Are you sure?

Wait! He's only been
with mares, right?

Maybe he's into stallions?


Infertile is as infertile does.

Wha...

Bye bye, guy.

You know, when Khrushchev
came to this country back in '58,

you know who he told
Ike he wanted to meet?

Mickey Mouse,

Kim Novak,

and me.


How come you're not at the lab?

That's why I'm
here, Arliss. Uh...

We have to talk.

I can't do it anymore.

Oh, sure you can!

I got you that new video.

"Sex Trek, The
Next Penetration."

not the problem.

I-I just need to pull
out of our little venture.

Pull out? You're joking!

Rock, you're okay, aren't you?

I used to say I didn't
want a job in baseball

because I couldn't
relate to today's players,

but that was bullshit.

I called every club and
asked for a job, and...

none of them would
gimme a chance

because they knew
I'd show up drunk.

Well, I guess after
seeing the TV thing,

somebody in New York must've

felt sorry for me or something

'cause I got a call
from the big club

telling me they'd give me a shot

as a hitting instructor.

That is if I stay clean.

New York?

Yeah.

That's great! That's great!

Well, it may be my last chance.

I don't wanna mess
it up, except I...

Except what?

Well, except, I'm
a little scared about

checking into a clinic.

The Rock in rehab.

Shit. (chuckles)

What'll people think?

I think it might help
a lot of other people.

Well, maybe. (chuckles)

Oh, one more thing.

No, no, no.

I'll pay for it.

I'll make it part of your deal.

You'll still make my deal?

On the house!

Hell, I'm not gonna
let you trust an agent!

(snorts, laughs)

Thanks.

Oh, I...

I brought you something.

("Chinatown" theme plays)

I don't know if you
were really in the ballpark

on that day or not, but...

that was. (chuckle)

That's my 500th home run ball.

Thanks.

No, thank you.

You...

Really helped me a
lot when I needed it.

Was that you?

Oh, hell.

I meant to call you,
but I forgot your number.


It's nine.

Good bye, kid.

Arliss: For most us,

the dream of becoming a champion

remains a fantasy.

But for a special few,

it is very much a reality.

We cheer them.

We live through them.

Athletes are our last warriors.

Alright! Yes!

Two. Three.

Stay down! Stay down,
honey. Stay down.

Stay down.
That's it. That's it.

She's out! She's out!

Yes! Yes!

We leased equipment,

not to mention
refunding our receipts

from the shopping network.

And what are we supposed to do

with 200 sperm decanters?

Use them as jelly jars?

Spit cups for chewing tobacco?

Jesus Christ, we're out
of pocket 50 grand at least!

(music continues)


I'm leaving.

Oh, okay. Have a good night.

Are you okay?

Fine!

Arliss, you are such a fan.

(crowd murmuring)

Announcer: Rocky's been stuck on
home run number 499 for almost a week.

Pascual gets the
sign. Here's the pitch.

(bat hitting ball)

There's a long drive,
deep to right, way back.

Arliss: My name
is Arliss Michaels.

I represent athletes.

These are my stories.

Announcer: Holy cow, Rocky Framaggio
has just hit home run number 500.

And this crowd is going crazy.

They're fighting for the ball.

And some youngster's
gonna have himself

one heck of a souvenir.

(crowd noise fades)

("Chinatown" music continues)
