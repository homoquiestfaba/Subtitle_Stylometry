KISS ME.

NO.

KISS ME! NOW.

UHH--UNH!

[muffled protests]

SHE MUST BE SOME GIRL.

TELL HER SHE'S LUCKY...

WHOEVER SHE IS.

[bells jingle]

THE "LUCKY" GIRL'S NAME
WAS HATTIE.

ONLY SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT SHE WAS ALL THAT LUCKY.

'CAUSE, YOU SEE, TO HATTIE,
WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.

BUT TO ME, SHE WAS, WELL--
SHE WAS MORE.

MUCH MORE.

AND IF I HAD MY WAY,
SOMEDAY SHE WOULD BE MINE.

SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

[male voice straining]
SAY YOU'RE SORRY!

SHE'S KILLING HIM.

WHAT'D HE SAY?

[man straining unintelligibly]

IT'S GOOD HE'S SORRY.

WONDERFUL!

AAH!

NOW THAT THAT'S
ALL OVER WITH,

BREAKFAST IS ON THE HOUSE.

YOU LISTEN TO ME.

I'M A GOOD PATRON
OF THIS PLACE.

NEVER HAVE I BEEN TREATED
LIKE THIS!

YOU CAN EXPECT TO HEAR
FROM MY LAWYER.

YEAH, WELL YOU CAN TELL HIM
FROM ME

THAT PINCHING MY ASS
ISN'T ON THE MENU.

DID YOU PINCH HER ASS?

WHAT? NO.
DID YOU PINCH HER ASS?

NO. NO.
YOU PINCHED HER ASS!

HOWARD,
YOU PINCHED HER ASS!

[couple leave arguing]

PLEASE.
YOU NEED TO BE
IN THERAPY.

YOU'RE A PIG.
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

HEY!
HEY, MISTER!

MISS! MISTER!

HEY.
AAH!

DON'T BE AFRAID, LADY,
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

HERE, YOU DROPPED YOUR WALLET
BACK OVER THERE.

COUNT IT, HOWARD.
THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES.

THEY'RE THIEVES.
COUNT IT!

COUNT THE MONEY.

VICKI, SHUT UP!

THANKS.

HATTIE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
ISN'T SHE?

SHE'S GOT A REAL FLAIR
FOR THE WAY SHE FEELS.

YEAH, SHE'S GOT A FLAIR,
ALL RIGHT--A REAL FLAIR.

STOP TALKING TO HIM.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

[engine starts]

YOU GOTTA REMEMBER NOT TO LET
HER GRAB YOU BY THE COLLAR,

'CAUSE IF YOU SLIP HER,
YOU CAN GET IT.

BUT IF SHE GETS YOU
BY THE COLLAR,

SHE'S GOT YOU
AND YOU GOTTA GIVE.

I'M GONNA MARRY HER.

YEAH?
YEAH. YEAH.

WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE.

DON'T WEAR A TIE
TO THE WEDDING.

ALL RIGHT.

CLOSE THE WINDOW.

OKAY. SEE YA.

OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

UH, MR. LINZER,
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

ANYTHING YOU NEED?

NO. GO, GO.

HOW COME YOU DON'T COME
TO OUR HOUSE

FOR DINNER ANYMORE,
SERGIO?

YOU MAD AT US?

I'LL COME.

YOU SAY YOU'LL COME,
BUT YOU DON'T COME.

I WILL.

YOU SAY YOU WILL,
BUT YOU DON'T COME.

LEAVE THE BOY ALONE.

LOOK AT THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE.

CUPID DANCES
ON HIS EYELIDS.

HA.

I'LL COME.

I WILL.

[bells on door jingle]

DO YOU REMEMBER BEING
IN LOVE LIKE THAT?

MAN, OH, MAN,
HAVE I GOT A STORY

OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
LAST NIGHT.

I WAS JUST MOPPING--
MOP, MOP, MOP--

WHEN THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
COMES INTO THE STORE,

AND SHE'S DRESSED RICH,
BUT NICE.

AND I SAY,
"LOOK, WE'RE CLOSED."

BUT SHE DOESN'T MOVE.
SHE JUST STAYS RIGHT THERE.

ARE YOU SURE
YOU WEREN'T DREAMING?

YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,

SO I BIT MYSELF
AND IT HURT.

YOU'RE LUCKY, SERGIO.
THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU.

NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ME.

BUT I'M GONNA CHANGE
ALL THAT.

OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

I'M GONNA GO
AND SEE THE WORLD.

YOU'RE GONNA GO SEE
THE WORLD?
YEAH.

WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

I DON'T KNOW,
FRANCE MAYBE,

OR ITALY, OR AFRICA.

DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
DIFFERENT PLACES FOR A CHANGE?

I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE IT HERE.

SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

I HAVE ASPIRATIONS.

I'M SAVING MY MONEY
TO SEE THE WORLD,

AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DIME.

BUT I'M GONNA BE MANAGER
OF LINZER'S SOMEDAY, YOU KNOW.

I'M GONNA HAVE PLENTY
OF MONEY THEN.

YEAH, "SOMEDAY."

WHO NEEDS MONEY, ANYWAY?

EVERYBODY NEEDS MONEY.

YOU GOTTA HAVE MONEY
TO GO PLACES,

TO SEE DIFFERENT
NEW THINGS.

[knocking on window]

I CAN'T, I'M S--

NO, I--TOMORROW.

TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?
TOMORROW.

HATTIE.

WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I SAVE MY MONEY?

COULD I GO WITH YOU?

YOU WANT TO SEE THE WORLD
WITH ME?

YEAH.
COULD I GO?

YEAH.
YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO.

OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

THAT DOES IT.
THAT DOES IT.

TOMORROW I'M MARCHING DOWN
TO MR. LINZER,

AND I'M DEMANDING
TO BE MADE MANAGER.

YOU SEE?
THAT'S ASPIRATION.

BUT YOU BETTER HURRY 'CAUSE
I'M NOT WAITING FOREVER.

SIR, COME ON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

GET OFF MY CAR.

HEY, I'M SORRY.
I'M GOING WITH HATTIE.

I'M SORRY. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SO, UM...

WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO FIRST?

I MEAN, YOU GOT A LOT
OF DREAMS, DON'T YOU?

YEAH.

WHAT'S THE FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS?

DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

[conversation fades]

[paper tears]

MR. LINZER, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

MR. LINZER.

IS SOMETHING WRONG?

DROP IT.

MR. LINZER,
WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.

YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.


YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

YOU CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

GOD REST HIS SOUL.

TIMES ARE BAD.

THIS PLACE IS DOING
VERY BAD.

I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
LOSE THIS PLACE

TO THE BILL COLLECTORS.

NO.
MM.

I DON'T MIND HAVING NOTHING.
I AM A MAN.

BUT MRS. LINZER...

I CAN'T WATCH HER LIVE
LIKE A DOG.

NO, I LOVE HER MORE
THAN THE AIR I BREATHE.

I WOULD RATHER DIE

THAN TO TELL HER I COULD NOT
PROVIDE FOR HER.

BUT YOU DO PROVIDE.
YOU PROVIDE HER WITH EVERYTHING.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE...

TO LOVE SOMEONE SO MUCH...

YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR THEM?

I DO.

YOU DO.

BURN THIS PLACE!

BURN?

IF THERE WERE A FIRE--
A SMALL FIRE--

THE INSURANCE
WOULD SAVE ME.

YOU WANT ME TO BURN
THIS PLACE?

NOT A BIG FIRE.

A SMALL FIRE.
A STRONG FIRE.

A GOOD FIRE.

JUST ENOUGH TO BURN EVERYTHING
TO THE GROUND.

SERGIO...

I'M DESPERATE.

I'M SIMPLY DESPERATE.

THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

BUT THIS IS--THIS IS
YOUR LIFE, MR. LINZER.

EVERYTHING THAT YOU
WORK FOR

IS BUILT AROUND YOU
RIGHT NOW.

YOU CAN'T JUST
BURN IT DOWN.

IT'S LIKE A MEMBER
OF YOUR FAMILY, MR. LINZER.

LOOK--LOOK AT THE OVENS
IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

AND HOW 'BOUT THESE WALLS?

W-WHAT ABOUT THE WINDOWS

AND THESE BEATEN UP
WOODEN FLOORS?

MR. LINZER, LOOK,
IT'S LIKE A PART OF YOU.

IF YOU BURN THIS DOWN,
IT'S GONNA BE GONE.

YES, I DO LOVE
THIS PLACE. YES.

THEN YOU'LL FIND A WAY
OF PAYING THE BILLS.

YOU'VE HAD HARD TIMES
BEFORE.

OH, SERGIO...

SERGIO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PAY ME RIGHT AWAY.

OH, NO, NO, NO.

I WANT YOU TO BE PAID.
[register rings]

HERE...

TAKE IT.

AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA BURN
THIS PLACE DOWN?

YOU HAVE MY WORD.

OKAY.

OKAY.

SERGIO, I PRAY
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU,

BUT IT HAPPENS
TO EVERY MAN.

YOU WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN TWO THINGS YOU LOVE.

ALL I LOVE IS HATTIE.

SO...

YOU SAID YOU'D ASK.

HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY
RIGHT NOW.

I SAID I'D WAIT,
BUT NOT FOREVER.

SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

YOU KNOW, I'M SAVING
EVERY PENNY I GOT,

BUT AT THIS PACE
I'M GONNA BE AT LEAST 110

BY THE TIME I HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

AND BY THEN
HATTIE'S GONNA BE IN FRANCE...

WITH SOME FRENCH GUY.

YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

I LIKE YOU, SERGIO.

YOU'RE NO RICHIE RICH,
BUT YOU GOT A GOOD HEART.

IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM

WITH THE TWO OF YOU
GETTING TOGETHER.

BUT SHE'S GOT THIS IDEA
ABOUT SEEING THE WORLD.

SO I TELL HER, "HATTIE,
WATCH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

SAVE YOUR MONEY."

I WOULD NOT GIVE UP.

I WORKED, AND I SAVED,
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HATTIE.

EVERY DAY MY LOVE FOR HER
JUST GREW MORE

AND MORE AND MORE

UNTIL SOMETIMES I WOULD FORGET
TO BREATHE.


HE FORGOT TO BREATHE AGAIN.

HMM.

I KNOW THIS MAY
SOUND STRANGE,

BUT I PICTURED US
AND THE PLACES WE WOULD GO.

IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME
IF IT WERE LONDON, OR PARIS,

OR FRANCE, OR SOME HOT,
SWEATY JUNGLE SOMEWHERE.

YOU SEE, THE FEELING WAS
ALWAYS THE SAME

BECAUSE I WAS WITH HATTIE
AND SHE WAS WITH ME.

WELL, LOOKING BACK NOW,
IT WAS ALL SO SIMPLE THEN.

AND THAT'S WHEN IT ALL
WENT WRONG.

[sirens blaring]

[dispatch radio droning]
[overlapping orders]

[firemen shouting
indistinctly]

GET IN THERE.
RIGHT THERE.

SERGIO. SERGIO.

THANK GOD.

THANK GOD YOU ARE OKAY.

YEAH, I'M OKAY.

I'M--I'M FINE.
I'M OKAY.

SERGIO.

HEY!

IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU?

PLEASE, HATTIE, PLEASE.

RIGHT NOW I GOT
A LOT OF THOUGHTS

FLYING THROUGH MY HEAD,
OKAY?

MR. LINZER IS WATCHING HIS LIFE
GO UP IN FLAMES.

WHAT COULD BE WORSE
THAN THAT?

THINGS.

THINGS THAT YOU'LL
NEVER KNOW.

THINGS?
YES, THINGS.

LIKE WHAT COULD BE
SO SPECIAL?

LIKE...

I DON'T HAVE A JOB.

HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SELFISH?

SELFISH?

EVERYBODY ELSE IS
AROUND HERE.

NOBODY'S THINKING
OF SERGIO CUCHO,

AND WHERE'S SERGIO
GONNA SLEEP TOMORROW,

OR HOW SERGIO
GONNA EAT TOMORROW.

AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
I'M NOT RICHIE RICH.

THAT PLACE WAS EVERYTHING
I HAD, HATTIE.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

FROM NOW ON,
I'M JUST GONNA THINK OF ME.

SERGIO CUCHO, ME.

[distant siren]

[broken glass tinkles]

[door opens, bell jingles]

OH, SORRY, I--

I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SURPRISE YOU.

FIRES MAKE PEOPLE
JUMPY, HUH?


UH...ARE YOU THE OWNER?

NO, I JUST WORK HERE.

I MEAN,
I USED TO WORK HERE.

YEAH, YEAH.

WHO ARE YOU?

UH, I'M JUST A GUY
WHO LIKES FIRE, THAT'S ALL.

YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE LATE.

YOU SHOULDA BEEN HERE
YESTERDAY.

I'M JERRY FITZPATRICK.

NICE MEETING YOU.

OH, UM, I'M SORRY.

OH. OH, BOY.

ARE YOU
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT?

UH, NO, NO.

NO, I'M NOT.
JEEZ.

WH--WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

SERGIO.
AND I DON'T--

I DON'T KNOW
WHO STARTED THE FIRE.

I DIDN'T SAY YOU KNEW
WHO STARTED THE FIRE.

YEAH, BUT YOU
WERE THINKING IT.

I WAS THINKING
NO SUCH THING.

JUST THE OPPOSITE.

WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS,

"THAT KID LOOKS LIKE
AN HONEST KID."

YEAH. YEAH.
[loud clatter]

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

GOOD. GOOD.

BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.


WANNA GO FOR A RIDE?

HUH?

FEEL LIKE TAKING
A RIDE SOMEWHERE?

THIS--THIS AIR WE'RE BREATHING,
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

IT'S, UH--
IT'S HURTING MY LUNGS.

I USED TO HAVE ASTHMA
AS A KID.

YEAH.

WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE BREATHING IN HERE, HUH?

SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

I WORK FOR MR. LUMPKE.

DRUGS?


MR. LUMPKE MAKES WIGS.

WHAT, WIGS LIKE IN HAIR?

HAIR FOR WOMEN.
TOUPEE FOR MEN.

SEE THIS HAIR I HAVE
ON TOP OF MY HEAD?

YEAH.

ONE OF THE FINEST TOUPEES
MADE TODAY.

THAT'S NOT YOUR HAIR?

AMAZING, ISN'T IT, HUH?

YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A LIVING
DOING THAT?

A VERY GOOD LIVING.

HAIRLESSNESS IS A SCOURGE
THAT MUST BE STOPPED.

JERRY SEEMED
LIKE A NICE ENOUGH MAN,

AND SO I TOLD HIM
ABOUT ME AND HATTIE.

THAT NOW SINCE
I HAD NO JOB,

I HAD NO CHANCE
OF GOING AWAY WITH HER.

JERRY SAID HE KNEW
ABOUT A JOB.

[door shuts]


SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT,

BUT MR. LUMPKE'S
VERY, VERY EAGER TO MEET YOU.

COME ON. COME ON.

[door opens]

SERGIO. TOM LUMPKE.

VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

SAME.

I HOPE WE'RE NOT
INCONVENIENCING YOU.

NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

WELL, JERRY HERE
CAN SOMETIMES SEEM IMPOSING.

I'M A TERROR.

WELL, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.


SIT.
THANK YOU.

WELL...

JERRY TELLS ME THAT YOU WORKED
AT THAT STORE

WHERE THEY HAD
THAT TERRIBLE FIRE.

YEAH.

WAS ANYONE HURT?
NO.

GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

RELIEVED HERE.

I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY JERRY BROUGHT YOU HERE.

YEAH, WELL, HE SAID THERE
WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A JOB.

WELL, A JOB, YES.
A JOB OF SORTS.

LET ME EXPLAIN.

WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING
TO DRINK? JERRY--

NO, NO, NO.

WHAT'S THE JOB?


I HAVE A SON YOUR AGE,

AND HE'S...

NOT AS GOOD A BOY AS YOU.

BUT HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I'VE GOT.

I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH.

BUT SOMETIMES
HE CAN BE DIFFICULT.

HE CAN BE VERY,
VERY DIFFICULT.

YOU SEE, MY SON...

MY SON...

MY BOY...

SET THAT AWFUL FIRE.

Y-YOUR SON STARTED
THE LINZER FIRE?!

YES.

AND HE WILL GO
TO JAIL.

YOU SEE, HE'S BEEN
IN TROUBLE BEFORE,

SO HE WILL GO TO JAIL.

AND THAT'S NOT
WHERE HE BELONGS

BECAUSE DOWN INSIDE

HE'S A GOOD BOY.

HE'S A BOY WITH TALENT!

EVERY DAY
I ASK MYSELF,

WHY COULDN'T HE BE
AN ORDINARY KID, YOU KNOW?

BUT IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING.

WHY WOULD HE--

WHY WOULD HE BURN DOWN
MR. LINZER'S STORE?

BELIEVE ME, I DON'T KNOW.

BUT HE DID IT.

HE DID IT.

AND IT'S KILLING ME.

IT'S KILLING ME, SERGIO.

WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?


IF SOMEONE
WERE TO TAKE THE BLAME

FOR THAT FIRE...

SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER BEEN
IN TROUBLE BEFORE.

THEY WOULD RECEIVE
A MINIMAL SENTENCE.

VERY MINIMAL.

PROBATION AT MOST.
