I can't hide it any longer

How I regretted for all these

I've lived in shame

but, today...

I can't face myself any longer

Lin Qiuhua, 21 years old

A typist of
The Far East Insurance Company

Upon initial investigation,
occupational neurasthenia

Could be the cause of her suicide

Did she leave behind any note?

No

but there's not a hint of
struggle at the scene

Her fingerprints are there
on the windowsill

There's no sign of any kind of struggle

All these conform
to the report of the witnesses

That's all for today's report

Good, thanks

A typist?

Commits suicide because of
occupational neurasthenia

There's no news value at all

Section Chief, Miss Lin Hongzhu is here

I have taken her to the autopsy

There's no doubt that it's her sister

Good, bring her in

Yes

Please come in

Have a seat

I'm very sorry for your sister

May I ask if she was engaged?

She wasn't

Did you notice her behavior lately

Or where she usually hung out?

I didn't pay attention to that

Has she ever stayed out even for a night?

Never

There was this once though

When was that?

About six months ago

When she met her first boyfriend

What's his name?

You have no idea?

I'd better be honest with you

Your sister was pregnant

been carrying for six months

I'd think that's
the main cause for her suicide

We didn't give out the truth

For the sake of your sister's honor

Can you give us any kind of clue?

I hope you can tell us what happened,
like...

between your sister and her boyfriend

That man is not her boyfriend

He is some other man

My sister slept with a man

Only once in her lifetime

but she didn't even

Know his name

I only came to know all this
by reading her diary

She's so silly

I mean,
how could she sleep with someone...

She has metjust once!

Can I take a look

At your sister's diary?

I've burnt it

June 10, Lin Qiuhua committed suicide

because of occupational neurasthenia

This happened six months after I met her

I am writing this down as a memoir to her

Excuse me, I'd like to inquire about

Two guests who stayed here some time back

Can I?

Well...

That was six months ago

A young couple came here one night

This is the picture of that young lady

Can you look up for me

Their registered names

I'm sorry

We have many guests
coming in and out each day

And six months is such a long time

Thank you

Can I talk to you

Sure

What is it that you want?

I want to know about a young couple

...who stayed here six months ago

The man drove here in his big,
grand automobile

He's a tall guy, about 30 years old

He could be one of your old customers

One of our old customers?

This is the picture of the lady

very slim, short hair

A bit shy

I remember now, it could be Mr. Zhou

Mr. Zhou?

It could be him

During summer...

He often brought his girlfriends here

He has a gorgeous car

With a blue license plate

Yes

but, he may have changed his car now

I heard he's in the automobile business

He owns gas stations
and a car-dealing company

Thank you so much

Hello. Yes, hold on

Mr. Lee, someone is here
for the General Manager

Excuse me, I've a call

This is Li Donghai. Who am I speaking to?

The GM is not in his office,
anything important?

I'd like to ask his opinion
about something

Can you give me his home address

And let me meet with his wife

What?

Our GM is still single

And he always stays in a hotel

The Palace Hotel

We are calling from the Jet Airlines

Can you give me the room number of...

Mr. Zhou Guoxiong

Mr. Zhou stays in room 305

Yes, he comes back
around 12 p.m. Everyday

Who are you?

May I have your phone number?

And I'll ask him to call you back

It doesn't matter

Mr. Zhou, someone called you just now

As you said,
I told her that you'll be back late

She hung up when I asked for her name

Xiulan, you are becoming ever so gorgeous

Really?

Thanks

You are the only one
who knew of my returning

At first I planned to stay in Japan
for another year

One more year?

Don't get anxious; on seeing you...

I think I'll give it a second thought

Lady, you're back

I know you wouldn't want to meet
with my mom

My mom said it seems that...

You're not very interested in
doing business

May be she likes Li Donghai

I for one don't like him one bit

I felt uneasy whenever I saw him

I'll call you later

Goodbye

See you

I hear Miss Xiulan is coming back soon,
is it?

Yes! Actually she should be settled down

Xiulan should not go to study in Japan

being so far away

Let you...

Mom

I'm back

Xiulan

You're back

Mom, this is for you

You are nice to me

How come you
didn't inform me of your return?

I'd have sent someone to pick you up

Oh, thought I'd make it a surprise

You're so naughty.
Let me look at you carefully

Miss Xiulan,
you're more and more beautiful

The future belongs to young people
like you two

These past few years
I've just been getting worse

Come on, open it mom

Xiulan

What?

God, it's been so long since we've met!

That's true, almost a year

Are you happy tonight?

Of course I'm happy

Strange! Why did you ask such a thing?

Guoxiong, where are you going?

This way doesn't lead to my home!

Guoxiong

Let's go up for a while

Xiulan, you know how much I love you

but this is totally different from love

Haven't I told you before

I mean, before we got married

We should keep a pure
and clean relationship

I know, but... I need you

Stop it

We should keep on waiting

Until when? Wait till when?

Until we get married.

by then everything of mine will be yours

Must we wait till marriage?

Xiulan, I can't wait any longer

Don't make it difficult for me, please

Tonight, I can go home by myself

I'm sorry

It's okay

Miss, you are bowling all alone

Shall we bowl together?

Sure!

How about we make a bet or something?

Gamble?

Sure, if I win...

I will treat you to a dinner and dance

You pay if you win?

Strike

In this case, I'll surely make a bet

Really?

Please

Is this your car? very cool

Let's go for a ride first, okay?

Sure. I'll go anywhere

with a man as handsome as you

Do you like me?

Of course

Otherwise I won't bring you here

Really! That's good

Then we should meet more often, shall we?

Yeah

When?

You tell me when?

Tomorrow

Tomorrow?

I can't make it tomorrow

Then the day after tomorrow

Neither can I

When then?

So, you really like me that much

Then next Monday at 8pm

Wait for me outside the bowling center

Sure, I'll be there

Good morning, General Manager

So it's you!

Something important
came up yesterday night

That I wanted to report to you

I've called the hotel a few times

but you weren't in

Did you go out with Miss Xiulan?

That's none of your business

What's so important?

I'll tell you now

These are the ten cars that
we ordered from...

The volkswagen Company in West Germany

They'll be here on the 10th of this month

We've ordered another five Chevrolets

...of 1969 make from The States

Mr. Zhou,
you're here to write a novel again

This time it's lyrics,
for a record company

Who knows what he writes

but he is pretty handsome

What? Have you fallen for him?

bullshit

I don't believe that

One needs a special place to write

22nd of January, Liu Minghua

After I had an argument with Xiulan

I went to the bowling center alone

I saw a woman bowling all by herself

So I bowled with her

She seemed to have
just lived out of poverty

And like, enjoying her novae rich life

She really came

These kind of women get together
just for fun

It's better not seeing her again

Let's pick this one

No way, this one is too noisy

We should pick one
that's a bit more graceful

What do you know? This is a wedding gift

So what?

Looks like you're very experienced

Of course, everybody now talks of techno

Maybe they have a bug in their new house

And they can eavesdrop on every word

So make it a bit noisier

That way they can't hear us, right?

Whatever, pick what you want

Let's get this one!

Ten dollars

We'll send the gift over

Okay!

Qimei, let's go!

I've something to do

I'm not going

She never comes with us

That's true

So she is lying

It's not that
she can't attend the wedding

but she is saddened by the joy

Of the young married couple

A woman at her age

Of course wants to get married

She of course wants the comfort
from a man

This kind of woman
will have a different feel

A woman like her

Will desire the warmth from a man

I'm sorry

So you like...

Japanese movies

Watching Japanese movies

One can also see the scenery of Japan

It's so nostalgic

Are you Japanese?

No, I'm Chinese, but I lived in Japan

My name is Yang Gangtian

So the places shown in this movie

Are not new to you at all

Not all though

Do you come to Hong Kong often?

That's why I remain single

No worries at all

My friends are very concerned about
my love life

I don't care however

Think about this; each day, every year

And the whole life
spend with only one person

How boring!

Well, you don't understand

I do

because I'm also single

but you do know what being content is

Okay, tonight I'll let you feel

How it's like to be contended

Let's go to a new place for drinks,
how's that?

Sure, no problem

It should be my turn to pay

What? You think I'm broke

Don't worry, I enjoy paying the bill;
especially...

when it comes to treating someone
as pretty as you

Not a single man
has ever come to my place

You're an exception

Please wait a minute

Hold on, my friend is about to go to bed

You can take a rest here! Help yourself

How can I? You don't have to

Come, undress and go to sleep!

No, don't be so naughty

No, don't do that

No...

Come in

This woman

Isn't she the one that
I've known a while ago?

The police are looking into
Liu Minghua's boyfriend

Will they come to me?

No, I'm a Chinese Japanese named
Yang Gangtian

Even if they come to me

I can still prove that
I wasn't at the scene

because when she was killed

I was with Li Qimei

Where is Miss Su?

She's in the backyard

Miss Su

Is it true that
you will go back to Tokyo...

before the end of the year?

No, that will be rather too hurried

Maybe I'll spend the New Year with mom

Anyway I haven't decided yet

Have you heard something about Guoxiong

About what?

Someone asked me about him

Said he has other women...

Mr. Li, Guoxiong has other women

It's partly my fault

Your fault?

Yes, but, Mr. Li

You have nothing to do
with us other than business

So please don't interfere
into our relationship

Mr. Li, your phone call

My phone call?

Excuse me

Hello, this is Li Donghai

Call me only at work

Haven't I told you that?

It's been a while since he came here

Did you two argue again?

We had an argument

The day I came back from Japan

That's not very good!

You're too strong in temper

Just like a boy

A lady should be more gentle

Otherwise Guoxiong will not like you

Let me get it

Hello, Guoxiong,
we're just talking about you

How are you?

I haven't seen you for a long time,
I'm sorry

The company has got a very large order

And I'm very busy

Tonight I'm free

Shall we go see a movie?

Oh, I'm very sorry

Tonight I need to go to a friend's place

It's all arranged

Oh yes! I was free in the past few days

I felt so bored at home

And you didn't call me

What a pity. Let's meet some other time

Okay, bye

Whose place are you going tonight?

It's a lie. I'll let him down first

Then I'll see him at the office

...to give him a surprise

Mind you don't turn it into a tragedy

If you keep on fooling him like this

This kid is so unmannered

Is there a Mr. Zhou living in here?

Mr. Zhou, yes

Do you mean
the one who is writing a novel?

Writing a novel?

Yes, you're right

I'm his fiancee Su Xiulan

Mr. Zhou asked me
to wait for him in the room

To wait for him? That's strange

He just drove away

He's out?

It doesn't matter

Mr. Zhou said...

Just inform the security
and that will be fine

Well...
it's not supposed to be like that...

but...

It's okay, come with me

Please help yourself

Thank you

Diary of a lady-killer?

Hope one day
I can win the heart of Xiulan

True love is not
only a matter of spirituality

but also a matter of physical enjoyment

She is like a prey to my trap

So I took her to the hotel

She didn't resist at all,
I can do whatever I want

Guoxiong, how can you face up to me

You painting is very good,
you're so talented

You have a bright future ahead of you

Are you an artist?

No, I'm a special correspondent of
the London Times

I like sculptural art

Two weeks ago

I went to vietnam to conduct an interview

I stopped over in Hong Kong
on the way back

Hong Kong is known to be
the Pearl of the East

So I wanted to have a glimpse of
some Eastern art

With this chance of a stop-over

but, I didn't know that...

Maybe I have to give up this idea

She has a good hobby

Woman who likes art
will easily fall for a man

Miss Zhu, I have a good idea

Let's have a drink

I'd like to thank you
for being my charming escort

Let's have a good time tonight

How does that sound?

Good

Want to come up?

Come in!

Just put it here

Please take a seat,
I need to change my clothes

Don't look!

I need your help

It's okay, you can go back to your seat

Don't look

I said don't peep, and you don't listen

Ready yet?

Okay, have a seat

Come

You're so beautiful

Let's toast for your beauty

Please don't

A body as perfect as yours

Shouldn't be covered up by clothes

It should be shown
and admired by everybody

You really admire my body?

Of course, it's God's greatest work

Okay

I thought you're someone
who understands art

One who knows how to appreciate beauty

but, you're just as vulgar as
any other man

I've made a mistake

Don't be mad, Lizhen

Your body is too gorgeous

Let me look at it carefully

Who?

I'm Meiyun, open the door!

He's so heavy

Who told you to drink so much...

Disgusting

Why do you have to drink so much?

Drunk as a pig

You must be the new boyfriend of Lizhen!

I'm sorry, I'm Meiyun

I'm learning painting

Let's have a drink, how's that?

I need to go, please enjoy yourself!

Meiyun... come here

Who told you to drink so heavily

Wait

I'm sorry

It's okay

Are we still friends?

Of course

This is my phone number

When you come by, call me first

Good, I'll surely call you

Lizhen...

Goodbye

Liu Minghua has been strangled to death

And so is Li Qimei

Whether or not
these two cases are related

but, how could they coincide so?

It's a weird coincidence, if at all

Why is it that whoever slept with me...

is being killed one by one

It couldn't be true.
Why are these things happening?

Is there anything that you want,
General Manager?

Nothing

Hello

Hello

Hello, are you Guoxiong?

I'm Xiulan. I'm now in Tokyo

Tokyo?

How come you are in Tokyo?

I'll tell you later

Guoxiong, please come to Tokyo at once

I need to talk to you

You must come

Guoxiong

I know why you asked me to come to Tokyo

Today is Easter

You want us
to spend the holiday in Tokyo, right?

Guoxiong, what are you thinking of?

I was thinking, I hope one day

We can find a place
that belongs only to us

We will love each other and nothing else

I'm yours, and you're mine

We'll lead a happy life together

A happy life together? How lovely

Tell me, Guoxiong

Can we really lead a happy life together

And stay with each other forever?

Of course!

Guoxiong

Guoxiong...

What happened?

Are you okay? Guoxiong...

Help me...

Are you feeling better now?

You suddenly fainted in the night club

God, you sure scared me!
Are you too tired?

I'm sorry

Maybe the performance proved too daring

What did you dream of?
You were talking in your dream

Xiulan

We've come all this way
to spend the holiday here

but I've ruined it

I'm so sorry

Don't say that, we are now together

...for a peaceful Easter night.
Isn't that better?

You know why I would suddenly

...come to Tokyo?

Why?

I need to think carefully about
our relationship

Xiulan

I think we should break up

Why?

I don't want to see you anymore

What? Xiulan, do you despise me

You don't love me anymore

I... but I...

but what?

I don't know what I should do

I'm so sad

Sad? Who makes you so sad?

You better ask yourself

I've read your diary

You...

Guoxiong, for one whole year

You were having affairs with those women

I have not the slightest idea at all

I still give out all my heart to you

How can you face up to me?

Xiulan, please forgive me

How can I forgive you!

We are engaged

And still you did such a thing

How wrong you are!

You can scold me, but please believe me

I do truly love you,
and will remain so forever

I know you love me

but I've never rejected you

I just want you to wait if you love me

Why can't you wait?

but instead, you turn to other women

It's exactly because I love you too much

So every time when you reject me

I got, like possessed
by an inferiority complex

So strong that I had no choice

but to overcome it by finding other women

I regretted so much every time
after the affair

I felt I have let you down

If so...

Why don't you go see a doctor?

I will. When I go back

I will surely find myself a doctor

Guoxiong

Know somethin'?
Actually I had decided that

I won't forgive you

but... l've failed

I do truly love you

Xiulan, I've let you down

I've let you down

What happened?

Let us calm down

Otherwise we'll go against your wish

Let's wait till we get married

Guoxiong, you're so good

I think this is
the most meaningful Easter

...we've ever had, isn't it?

It's raining

Someone is plotting against me

Guoxiong

Guoxiong, what are you talking about?

Xiulan, will you believe me

No matter what happened?

I will believe you

I need to return to Hong Kong tomorrow

...to deal with an important matter

What is it?

I can't tell you now

Nor do I want to see you...

getting involved in this

We can only lead
a true happy life together

...after this matter is settled

Then...

Zhu Lizhen, will she also get killed?

Now she's the only one who can prove

...that I'm not the murderer

Miss Zhu, you're back!

I've called you a few times

but you weren't in

Now is the school holiday,
no one is around

Can we meet?

I need to talk to you
about something important

Meet with me?

Tonight 11:30 at your home

Sure, I'll be there. bye

Good, nothing has happened to her

Maybe I'm too sensitive

This is strange!

Li Qimei's home is like this
when she got killed

Lizhen

Lizhen

Lizhen

Lizhen

Someone wants to trap me
with all these dead bodies

Miss Zhu, Miss Zhu

How come the door is opened

The diary of a lady killer is lost

Even though I didn't kill them

Still, the police will suspect me

They will come to me sooner or later

I just hope that it won't be today

When the first victim
Liu Minghua was killed

Where were you?

I'm asking, where were you?

I was in Li Qimei's room

So only Li Qimei can prove that...

you were not at the scene

but she also got killed

That was 22nd of March,
2:30 in the morning

Where were you by then?

I was in Zhu Lizhen's room

Zhu Lizhen also got killed later on

When Liu Minghua was killed...

The defendant was in Li Qimei's room

When Li Qimei got killed

The defendant was in Zhu Lizhen's room

That means except for the dead

No one can prove that

The defendant was not at the scene

That means...

Yes, someone else can prove that

Who?

That night a man and a woman came in

They are friends of Lizhen

They came for Lizhen,
and they even looked at me

What are their names?

I forgot

Where do they live?

I can't remember

Quiet

When Zhu Lizhen was killed

Where were you?

Where were you?

You can't answer that! No wonder

The night Zhu Lizhen got killed

The defendant was in Zhu Lizhen's room

It's a conspiracy

Someone intentionally killed them
one by one

Someone is plotting against me

Calm down

The court will now produce
the following exhibits

According to the test result

This panty hose is the means
which was used in murder

This was found in the defendant's room

At Apartment Luoyang

The second exhibit is this lighter
and cigarette butt

Found in the room of the victim, Li Qimei

The defendant
has already admitted that...

The lighter belongs to him

The third one is a tie

This tie is the tool

That was used to killed Zhu Lizhen

Also found in the room of the defendant

Doctor,
did you notice any sign of struggling

With Zhu Lizhen?

That's a bit hard to say.
blood stain was found

inside the right hand finger nail
of the defendant

What's the blood type?

Type Ab

What's the blood type of the victim?

Type O

And the blood type of the defendant?

Type Ab

Okay

In order to prove that
the defendant is guilty

The Court allows appearance of
a special witness

About a year and a half ago

Mr. Zhou rented a room in our place

He said... he is a novel writer

Mr. Zhou is the General Manager of the

Locally acclaimed Far East Company

When he stayed in our hotel

There was nothing suspicious about him

As of the murder case of Liu Minghua

The defendant is not guilty
due to lack of evidence

He's convicted for murders of
Li Qimei and Zhu Lizhen

And will be sentenced to
imprisonment for life

Guoxiong... Guoxiong

Guoxiong... Guoxiong

Guoxiong...

I need to appeal...

The Court is adjourned

Are you Lawyer Hong?

Yes, I'm Hong bolun. Have a seat

Please, take a seat

I'm Su Xiulan

I know, after Zhou Guoxiong was sentenced

He kept on calling your name

So, you were at the Court that day

To investigate in this case

I wouldn't call it "investigation"

I just happen to be
interested in this case

Lawyer Hong,
I hope you can help Guoxiong

He won't kill

I don't believe that he is a murderer

Do you have any proof?

No

but we have been engaged for
more than two years

Of course he has been wrong in the past

but recently he begged for my forgiveness

And I did forgive him

Our relationship has moved
a big step forward

So why would he want to kill...

when our relationship is
at it's best moment!

Lawyer Hong

I know you're very experienced

And you have saved
a lot of innocent people

So please help Guoxiong

No matter what

I know you love Zhou Guoxiong

And you believe that he is innocent

I also think that
this case has a lot of loopholes

I believe that he is not the murderer

That's why I'm willing to
investigate into it

but Miss Su,
you have to cooperate with me

I'd want to know about the past affairs

...of your fiance

I won't try to avoid the reality

I lost my mind because ofjealousy

I've no complains

I envy Mr. Zhou

For having such a loving fiancee as you

First, you need to investigate

into the hotels or apartments
that he lived in

Most importantly,
to check out on those women

who had frequent contacts with him

Record their information in detail,
understand?

Miss Xiulan, you're back

Yes, speeding again

Mom

You're back, Xiulan

Did you find a good lawyer?

Mom, I have good news for you

Lawyer Hong has agreed to help

Lawyer Hong?

Isn't he the famous Lawyer Hong bolun?

Correct

He's good at redressing mishandled cases

If he can help...

Guoxiong can be saved

Great! I too do not believe that Guoxiong

...would do such an evil thing

Why did you bring out the birds?

Madam

The boss of the sausage shop
told me today that...

birds need sunshine

Sunbathing will make their songs
more delightful

I've never heard of such a thing

He said his experience told him that

Okay then, you can bring it out
for more sunshine

Yes

Donghai

You too had the same kind of bird,
didn't you?

Remember to bring it out
for more sunshine

So that it can sing more beautifully

Yes

Sad, sad

Who makes you so sad

Is it the budding of plum flowers,

Or it's the rose
that didn't come into blossom

Who, who

Who had hurt you so much

Even if you dry up your tears

And bring out all your sorrow

There's only emptiness

The world is a place of fallacy

So why dream in tears

Dreaming for one that never comes

A lie, a lie

Where is true love if love does exist

If you know

Then you don't have to be sad

Miss Qin, I would like to know

If you have noticed any strange behavior

...on part of Zhou Guoxiong

Like nymphomania

Are you trying to ask if he has ever...

attempted to strangle me?

So the police has already asked you that?

A very detailed questioning indeed

Perhaps they hoped for me to say that...

Zhou Guoxiong has this bad habit

but I'm sorry, he didn't

Then... does he have other kind of
abnormal behavior

If loving women
is not considered abnormal

Then he's perfectly normal

So you two frequently went on dates?

Only once. Does that surprise you?

I'm sorry,
but... are you Miss Guo Meiling?

Yes!

So you're the famous lawyer, what's up?

Are you the ex-girlfriend of
Zhou Guoxiong?

Yes!

That was a year ago

We met at the beach

He asked me to swim with him

He's very handsome

He said he liked me

And actually I liked him too

So I accepted his invitation

We had a wonderful time together

Later I went with him
to a nightclub for drinks

And what happened thereafter

I'm sure you can imagine

Then, according to you...

is he really abnormal,
just as the paper described?

I'd say he is very much normal

Mr. And Mrs. Wang

It's me again

Did anyone come for Zhou Guoxiong lately?

No one

Really?

Then recently did he bring anyone back

...to this apartment?

He usually came back late

Moreover, he doesn't usually
stay overnight here

No wonder

You can't recall much about him

He doesn't come that often, you see!

I'm sorry, I've bothered you too much

It doesn't matter

Goodbye

What?

Nothing

Lawyer Hong

Miss Su, how come you're here so late

Anything important?

I feel uneasy at heart.
Even at home I kept tarrying

What happened to you?
Your head is bleeding

I almost got killed by a car

What happened?

I should know better

He will come sooner or later

I'm trying to prove that

Zhou Guoxiong is not the murderer

So the real murderer tries to kill me

because I'm investigating into this case

Then you...

Don't worry,
this has happened to me many times

So Miss Su, any news?

I went to the Apartment Luoyang today

It must be hard on you

Did you find anything?

No

Same for me;
we've come up with nothing so far

What's the use of this list of women?

We didn't find any clue in it

Miss Su,
besides the women on this list...

Do you know if Zhou Guoxiong

...has any other women?

I really wouldn't know that

I'm sorry. Shouldn't ask you this

but, I've asked Guoxiong

And he didn't tell me

Then... will that diary be useful

Diary? What diary?

I mean the diary of a lady killer

Diary?

Yes, please tell me

Where did you
put the diary of a lady killer?

I think the murderer
that plotted against you...

is related to one of your women

Tell me! Where did you hide that diary?

I have not hidden it

You haven't hidden it!

It's lost

When?

I remember the day when Lizhen was killed

I had it on the desk

When I went home

It's already gone

The murderer has destroyed

All the evidence

Mr. Zhou

Why don't you rewrite the diary
all over again

According to your memory

Rewrite it word by word

Otherwise we are hopeless

Next time when we go to Court

If we can't produce enough evidence

You want me to rewrite the diary
all over again

but who will believe in what I write

No one will believe in what I said

Forget it! Enemy of the women,
nymphomania

Enough of that!
before I got sentenced by the Court

This society has already sentenced me

Come in

What do you want, Mr. Li?

Nothing in particular

I went to meet you at home,
but you weren't in

So I came to look for you here

How did you know I was here?

Well... any progress with the case?

No

Guoxiong's appeal is a month away

My heart is so restless now

Of course!

If you need anything

Just let me know

Thank you

Then, I better get going. Goodbye

You're back, Lawyer Hong

Who is that man, one who just went out?

He is the General Manager of
the Far East Company

So he's the successor to Mr. Zhou!

Just now you mentioned about
something important

What is that?

From his diary, Mr. Zhou recalls a woman

...who has committed suicide

Her name is Lin Qiuhua

Among all those women

She's the only one that committed suicide

The date of her suicide

is a month ahead of the first murder case

You mean the suicide of Lin Qiuhua...

has something to do with Guoxiong?

Yes. Even though the newspapers mentioned

She had occupational neurasthenia

but I seriously doubt it

So I went to the police station
to double check

I found out that when she died...

She is already six months pregnant

Her sister came to inspect the body

This is her sister's address

I think we need to talk to...

Lin Qiuhua's sister

Miss Su,
I think it'd be more appropriate...

for you women to speak to each other

Do you mind to go?

No problem

Is there a Miss Lin Qiuhua

...living in here?

Are you asking about Miss Lin...

who used to live on the second floor?

Around October of last year

Miss Lin sold all her furniture

After that a lot of people
have moved in and out

So nobody did pay much attention

As of when she actually moved out

Did anyone come to look for them?

Let me think... oh yes

A reporter of some magazine

...did come two or three times

He wanted to ask about
her sister's suicide

After that no one came for her

Do they have any relatives?

I don't think so

Thank you

Don't get upset, we're still hopeful

We've already put in a classified

I hope we'll soon get a response

Once Lin Hongzhu appears,
we'll have a chance

Hello, yes

Please hold on

Someone said last year a woman
stayed at his place

She might be the one we're looking for

Hello, where are you?

Apartment Jielu in Yaumatei

Lawyer Hong, Apartment Jielu

Is the one that Zhu Lizhen lived in

Don't worry about that, I'll come at once

She is a model by profession

She used to tour overseas to perform

She came back only around two days a week

For the past two months
she didn't come back at all

It's good
she has a six month deposit with me

So I don't worry at all

Where is Zhu Lizhen's room?

That one

So she just lived here!

I never imagined it's that close

Isn't this that diary?

This is the crucial
diary of a lady killer

How come it's here!

The most important part of this diary

Are the pages about Lin Qiuhua

How come it's been torn out?

In this case, Lin Hongzhu is undoubtedly

...the sister of Lin Qiuhua

Will Miss Lin come back?

Maybe not

Why?

because she has left the diary here

She is hoping that...

We can discover this diary

That's right

Lawyer Hong, I have this feeling too

If Miss Lin were the real murderer...

She won't leave the diary behind

I guess we've paid too much attention
to this diary

And left out the fact that
someone hates Guoxiong

That's true.
We ought to concentrate on notjust...

the women included in this diary;

but to a wider area

Let's simplify the case

Miss Lin hates Guoxiong

because he is the cause of...

Her sister's suicide

Will someone then make use of this hatred

...to plot against Guoxiong?!

Maybe this person...

bears a deeper grudge against Guoxiong

And until now

He is still doing something against him

Hello. Hold on please

Miss Su, your phone call

Seems like it's a woman

Calling from the Apartment Luoyang

Hello

I wanted to tell you this
the last time you came

Around end of last year

Someone called looking for Mr. Zhou

Yes, he said he's a newspaper reporter

That's right.
He asked if Mr. Zhou is at home

Yes, it was a man

What time?

Around December of last year

by that time Mr. Zhou was not at home

He just went out a while ago

What?

That's right, so he hung up in a hurry

by that time
I wasn't paying much attention

When I found out
Mr. Zhou is not a man of the art

Then I wondered, why would he call him?

Yes, that's right

What's more,
when I talked to him on the phone

I heard a bird singing in the background

I remembered talking to my husband

That maybe the reporter...

is using the phone of a bird shop

very good! Thank you very much

She said that a newspaper reporter

has once called Guoxiong

Really?

Seems like the reporter that
went to see Lin Hongzhu

Is the same person as this one

Is this the sound that you've heard?

That's right, it's this sound

I've no doubt about it

Thank you

Mom, do you think
Guoxiong could be acquitted?

I don't believe that
Guoxiong is the murderer

Could it be that
someone is jealous of him

And is making use of
his lifestyle to set a trap!

And one by one...

Killed all the women that
he once got along with!

Xiulan, what do you mean?

I was thinking,
this could be a way to harm someone

What kind of strange idea that you have!

It's getting dark.
Looks like it's going to rain soon

It's getting late, let me take you home!

No, I'm not going back

Don't you know what to do

...To win over my heart?

Xiulan

Take a seat!

I need some water

Sorry, I forgot to put some water
in the fridge

It's not too cold

Isn't this the same bird
as the one in my home?

You forgot that
I've brought back two of these birds

...from New Zealand?

This is a precious breed

I'm afraid they are the only two
in Hong Kong

Everyday when I hear them sing

I feel like being with you everyday

Xiulan, I love you

Do you know that I've loved you...

Since a long time back

Not here, take me to the room

Okay

I've always been dreaming of

being with you forever

I believe this dream will soon
become a reality

Don't rush

I love you.
I love you so much I'm getting insane

Do you know that Guoxiong and I
love each other too

Don't mention that asshole Guoxiong

I'm so mad when you were in love with him

Everyday I kept thinking;
even if I have to kill him

I have got to win you over

What? You said you have to kill Guoxiong

And win me over

Well, I did think about that

In order to have you,
I've already done so

You devil!

You ruthless murderer

You killed all these innocent women

Just to satisfy your selfish desire

Stop, don't move!

Miss Su, are you okay?

I don't know since when

did I come to know that
I was in love with Xiulan

Xiulan... whenever I call this name

I'm thrilled with joy and excitement

but, when I thought about
Guoxiong and Xiulan

Joy turns into hatred and anger

So I've decided to plot against Guoxiong

but when I've given up Xiulan

And fell in love with Lin Qiuhua,

I found out that

She killed herself because of Guoxiong

I swear that I will avenge her

So I made use of Lin Hongzhu

who also wanted to avenge
her sister's death

I've designed a plan to have my revenge

And made him look like the suspect

In Guoxiong's room

I had read his diary of a lady-killer

So I started killing all those women
one by one

Hongzhu is frightened by my cruelty

She is not willing to cooperate anymore

but I can't let her go

because she knew too much

So after I locked her up for a few weeks

I've killed her too. I'm arrested today

Maybe I'm guilty

but at least I can face up to Qiuhua

She is waiting for me

In that faraway land

Calling for me

Guoxiong

Xiulan

Guoxiong

Please don't ever leave me again
