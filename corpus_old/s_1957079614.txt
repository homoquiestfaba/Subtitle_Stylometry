You know, it's impossible
to pick a favorite episode.

I'll tell you the truth!

I promise!

[German accent]
Of course you vill,
Dr. Solomon.

Oh, God.

I think the one that still
stands out the most to me
is the 3-D episode.

I love that episode.

I just-- There's something
very different about it,

and it's its own beast.

<i>â™ª [Women singing]</i>

I'd say when we're first
discovering our ethnicity,
our race.

â™ª --Anybody know
we was leavin' â™ª

â™ª Lord I might just
lay my head down and die â™ª

Tommy, what are you doing?

Well, I-I'm black now.

Without a doubt, it would be
the episode where we find out

that we're Jewish.

Who knew that Solomon
was a Jewish name

when we took it off
the side of that truck?

Go figure.

And it was the most
fun to do, so...
They were Jewish.

I don't know what to say.

<i>Mazel tov.</i>

There again, I could make
a list of 40 top 40 favorites,

all of which I hope will be
included in the reel.

I am red-freakin'-hot!

The first one that comes to
mind is frying bacon naked,

which I think
is a lot of fun.

Ah, ah, ah, ah!

Aaagh!

There's this one moment
that I always see

when they play
the highlight reel,
you know,

of when French and I
are feeding the baby.

Hey! He likes it!
Oh!

Maybe not.

It's a hilarious thing,
and that was
such a funny scene,

but I always resent seeing it
'cause I mess up

and I laugh at the end,
and they kept it.

The other one
would be, um,

an episode where I get
hypnotized by Tommy and Sally

and I end up going to
a restaurant to confront
the Big Giant Head,

and he keeps saying
the words that sort of
set off my hypnosis.


My shoes are on fire!

I love that scene.

In terms of Sally,
I would have to say,

and this is the se--
third episode we ever shot,

and it's the episode where
she kicks down the door.

She wears this hot red dress.

This guy's not
calling her back,

and she goes to a bar
with Jane and Simbi

and just screams in rage.

You've got to let it out.

Come on.
Open up.

[piercing scream]

I certainly do remember what I
think is the funniest moment,

which was when I stormed
upstairs in drag...

Well, that was a wash.

...and yanked off
my wig and earrings

and said I need...
...some herbal tea and
a fat-free cookie.

We did two passes, and only
on the second pass

Bonnie came-- ran
forward and said,
"Can you yank your wig off,

and your earrings,"
so it was virtually
an improvised moment.

I just thought
it was hilarious.

I think my biggest
challenge playing Harry
is keeping him moronic.

You're really only operating
with a brain stem.

<i>[Woman, on TV]
And 1, and 2,</i>

<i>and there you go, that's it!</i>

You are not.


I didn't really know much
about slapstick,
one, two, three,

all that stuff.

So it was challenging,
you know, getting to yell,
you know, to the back row.

Yow!

I think generally just
maintaining the energy for it,

the high pitch, and somehow,
sometimes it's so strenuous.

<i>The most difficult thing ever
was doing the  Stomp  parody,</i>

and the week afterwards.

All of us were, like,
stunned by how much it
made our legs ache.

Oh, it was just murder.
We couldn't move after that.

<i>And the thing with
3rd Rock is you never know
when you're gonna be--</i>

something like that is
gonna be thrown at you.

<i>I mean, I started training
halfway through  3rd Rock</i>

'cause I just knew
that any day now,

they could ask me to lift
a pickup truck or something.

The biggest challenge in
playing Sally is probably
answering questions

like, you know, what's it like
being a man in a woman's body?

Hey, what do you think?

They seem to have greater
power when they collide.

I'm not wrong, am I?

That was why it was so fun
to do that show with John

where we switched
personalities.

Oh my God!

I'm gorgeous!

Because I really didn't
think it was very different
than Sally at all,

but apparently a lot
of other people did.

For all the men of Rutherford,

beneath this pretty
package is a mind!

Do you hear me? A mind!

You know, you just
never wanna cross a line
and be too manly,

and she loves the fact
that she's a woman,

yet she also is very--
you know, has a lot of
derision towards it.

Would you look
at these breasts?

Hey, Dick,
can we touch 'em?

Be my guest.
They're not mine.

Hey!

<i>I think the thing that
3rd Rock does best,
as opposed to other sitcoms,</i>

is it's unabashedly goofy.

I think it's--
I think it knows
it's a sitcom.

And I think it's not
afraid to be that.

But all the while sort of
winking at the fact
that it's a sitcom.

And I love that.

What I'm always proud of
is that it doesn't--

it never takes itself
seriously, ever.

Hey, Donny!

You got room for a cop
out on your roof?

Sure!

I think, in that way,
we really kept more integrity

than any other show on TV.

I don't think that
there's a show on television

that I've personally seen
in the last ten years

that has the physical comedy
that we do.

I need you to find out
what's funny.

Oh, I can't; I gotta build
the shelving in the closet.

How am I supposed
to know what's funny?

I think it's a pretty
all-balls-out attitude

from the get-go, and that's
certainly led by John,

without a doubt.

And we just follow
and go for it.

This is brilliant!

We're entitled to go
absolutely anywhere

and do anything,
mainly 'cause we don't know

there's anything wrong
with what we're doing.

Uh, we can be dirty
or we can be more outrageous.

We can be
politically incorrect.

I'm out.

I'm out of the closet!

We didn't know.
Don't blame us.

We didn't know;
we're aliens.

Isn't it great to always
have that excuse?

Yes, it definitely is.
Sorry, I'm an alien.

It's a permit that we have
that nobody else has.

I'm just gettin'
a cookie.

Look, me and the rest
of the cast,

we just really wanna thank you
for what you've done for us

for the past six years.

I think the thing
I'll remember most is...

<i>really, just
the day-to-day workings,</i>

<i>which is, you know, coming in
and you've got a cast and crew</i>

<i>that sort of becomes
your family.</i>

<i>[Joseph]
Everybody's cool
and I like everybody.</i>

I've never been on another set
that's like that.

<i>That there's not at least</i>

<i>some people
at each other's throats.</i>

<i>[John]
We spend our days laughing...</i>

<i>laughing and laughing
and laughing,</i>

trying to figure out
how to make other people laugh.

<i>And I had always loved
the performances,</i>

<i>but I loved it
when we got to laugh,</i>

mainly, when Jane
broke up.


I'm gonna need you
to stand very, very--

[holding back laughter]
[wheezing laugh]

Let me
kiss you again.


Stay with it.
Stay with it, girl.

Stay with it.
Okay.

I just needed
some pain.

There's nothing more
sort of exquisite

than seeing Jane Curtin
break up, 'cause you know

this is gonna go on
for another 20 minutes.


We'll get it.

Stay with us.
Stay with us.

And...

These three guys,
John, French, and Joey,

that I feel like,
literally, are my brothers,

<i>and they've helped me learn
so much about myself</i>

<i>and so much about acting,</i>

and I will miss that
more than anything.

[audience cheering,
applauding]
