  (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)  

         Okay, you know,        
         let's have some        
         family time.           

         Okay, here's one,      
         you guys.              

        You can have sex        
        with one celebrity.     
        Who's it gonna be?      

        Now that's a good one.  
       That's a good question.  

    Lois, who's it gonna be?    

                Danny Gans.     

                    He's dead.  
                  What?         

            Oh, my God. When?   

      Like, earlier this year.  

              (SPEAKS HEBREW)   

           So does that         
           change your answer?  

                    No.         

        Okay, you know what?    
        Then Lance Burton.      

     Because he could pull      
     quarters out of me that    
     I didn't know were there.  

        What about you, Peter?  

          Brigitte Nielsen.     
                      Who?      

          From <i> Rocky IV.</i>       

  You know, the blonde,         
  kind of butch-looking blonde  
  with the short hair.          

  Although, you know,           
  I can never tell what her     
  relationship with Ivan Drago  

        was supposed to be      
        in that movie.          

       You know, I mean,        
       was she his girlfriend   
       or his agent or him?     

     That's a terrible choice.  
     Pick someone current.      

          All right,            
          Cate Blanchett.       

           What... Why?         

   Because I'm told             
   she's quite beautiful.       

                       By who?  

    The press and women         
    and gay guys.               

          So, everyone          
          except straight men.  

    Yes. Plus I want            
    children who can't          
    go in the sun.              

        Ooh, Cate Blanchett,    
        va-va voom.             

 What about you, Brian?         
               Mayim Bialik.    

      Really? Why?              

          Because I know        
          that she would        
          never hurt me.        

         I know that she        
         would never leave.     

       Wait, was she            
       Punky Brewster?          

          No, she was Blossom.  

    Oh, no. Ooh, is that        
    what's gonna happen         
    to Hannah Montana?          

            No! She's gonna be  
            beautiful always!   

            Whoa.               

        Okay, buddy.            

      Well, I would pick        
      Mrs. Humphreys.           

                      Who?      

       Mrs. Humphreys.          
       She checks us in         
       at daycare.              

                  That's not    
                  a celebrity.  

      (SCOFFS) Everybody        
      at daycare knows          
      who she is.               

     And she smells like        
     applesauce and chalk and   
     a little bit of whiskey,   

        and that suits me       
        just fine.              

           How about you, Meg?  

          C-3PO.                

            What... What?       

   Yeah, he seems like          
   he'd be really smart         
   and kind of gentle.          

           Gentle? Meg,         
           you sleep with him,  

             he'd cut you open  
             like a tin can.    

      (YELLING) Well,           
      maybe that's              
      what I like!              

  You guys don't know me!       

         (SOBBING)              

           So, we all go        
           pleasure ourselves   
           in separate rooms    

         and come back in 10.   

            Sounds good to me.  

             PETER: Hey,        
             what about Chris?  

         LOIS: Oh,              
         he already finished    
         about 16 times today.

      First of all,             
      there's a line in here    
      where he says,            

        "It must be weird       
        not having anyone       
        (BLEEP) on you."        

 Now, do I think that's weird?  
 Is that... That is weird?      

 I would think...               
 Yes, you think it's weird.     
              Okay.             

      Okay, and then, also,     
      there's a scene here      

     where we're making love    
     in the swimming pool,      

        and I'm writhing        
        around in ecstasy       
        in the water.           

      Now, do you want me       
      to climax while he's      
      shoving me underwater     

        or do you want it       
        when I come up          
        gasping for air?        

 You know, just go ahead        
 and do what feels right,       

 but we did want to             
 have you in your

  <i> Yes, no one succeeds at</i>      
  <i> failure better than Fox.</i>     

 <i> So here's some clips</i>          

      <i> from a few pilots</i>        
      <i> that actually never</i>

 <i> Let's take a look.</i>            

        (SIREN WAILING)         

 I'm not going in there.        

         Well, I'm not either.  

 But there's                    
 a drug dealer in there.        

           I know, but what if  
           he's got a cat?      

      Oh, God.                  

     I'm gonna be all sniffles  
     while I'm shooting.        

   'Cause you know,             
   it's not the fur.            
   It's the dander.             

             We're in the       
             wrong profession.  

 On the way back,               
 let's not go the way           
 with the toll.                 

      (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)       

 <i> Here's the main title</i>         
 <i> sequence from a failed</i>        
 <i> Fox western pilot.</i>            

 <i> And I think part of</i>           
 <i> the problem might be</i>          
 <i> the theme song itself.</i>        

 <i> Take a look at this.</i>          
 <i> These lyrics don't seem</i>       
 <i> to make a lot of sense.</i>       

      MAN: â™ª There was a man    
      <i> who shot the man</i>         

        <i> â™ª who was a man</i>        
        <i> who shot the man</i>       
        <i> Cal Johnson</i>            

     CHORUS: â™ª Cal Johnson      

      MAN: â™ª He wore a hat,     
      <i> his favorite hat</i>         

      <i> â™ª He loved that hat,</i>     
      <i> he hated hats</i>            
      <i> Cal Johnson</i>              

     CHORUS: â™ª Cal Johnson      

      MAN: â™ª He was a dad       
      <i> to zero kids and yet</i>     
      <i> he fathered five</i>         

  <i> â™ª He got shot dead a year ago</i>
  <i> and yet he's still alive</i>     

      <i> â™ª He's rich beyond</i>       
      <i> his wildest dreams</i>       
      <i> yet never had a dime</i>     

    <i> â™ª A lawman to the very end</i> 
    <i> he led a life of crime</i>     

      <i> â™ª In all his years</i>       
      <i> of life on Earth</i>         
      <i> he never fired a gun</i>     

     <i> â™ª Yet when it</i>             
     <i> came to Chinese men</i>       
     <i> he shot down every one</i>    

     <i> â™ª He had a horse</i>          
     <i> named Bandit and the</i>      
     <i> horse's name was Clyde</i>    

      <i> â™ª Cal Johnson was born</i>   
      <i> the day he died â™ª</i>        

     (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)      

             Yeah.              

 <i> Patrick Warburton</i>             
 <i> as Cal Johnson.</i>               
 <i> We... Yeah.</i>                   

      <i> So here's the deal.</i>      
      <i> We have a slight problem.</i>

      <i> Our time's almost up</i>     
      <i> and we kind of</i>           
      <i> promised the network</i>     

      <i> that in exchange</i>         
      <i> for getting to do this</i>   
      <i> little show and play</i>     

      <i> that we would really</i>     
      <i> promote the heck out</i>     
      <i> of</i> The Cleveland Show.   

       <i> But we haven't done it.</i> 
       <i> All we've done is sing</i>  
       <i> songs and cuss a lot.</i>   

  <i> Yeah.</i>                        
  <i> So how about this?</i>           

  <i> As long as we're</i>             
  <i> swearing so much,</i>            

 <i> let's play a little game</i>      
 <i> that might help promote</i>       
 <i> the show.</i>                     

        <i> Every time we curse</i>    
        <i> or use a bad word,</i>     

         <i> instead of a bleep</i>    
         <i> you'll hear this.</i>     

  AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i>  

        <i> Hmm. Interesting.</i>      
        <i> So, like, if I wanna</i>   
        <i> refer to my genitalia,</i> 

            <i> instead I'd say...</i> 

  AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i>  

 <i> Right. Or, instead of saying,</i> 
 <i> "erotic gratification"</i>        
 <i> or something like that,</i>       

  <i> I'd say, "Last night</i>         
 <i> I watched</i> Law & Order SVU

   AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i> 

      (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

           <i> "Hey, Seth,</i>         

         <i> "you've got</i>

   AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i> 

        <i> Or I could say,</i>        
        <i> "Gosh, Alex,</i>           

    <i> "last night you gave me</i>    
    <i> a really low-energy..."</i>    

  AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i>  

         <i> I think I understand.</i> 
         <i> Let me see.</i>           

         <i> So I could say,</i>       
         <i> "Hey, I just spent</i>    
         <i> all day at yoga</i>       

            <i> "and my..."</i>        
   AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Cleveland.</i> 

        <i> "...smells like</i>

       <i> You could definitely</i>    
       <i> say that.</i>               

      (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)       

     (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)      

      <i> Doesn't bother me.</i>       
      <i> I take care of myself,</i>   
      <i> I do yoga.</i>               

       (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)        

          <i> And if that's</i>        
          <i> a byproduct,</i>         
          <i> so be it.</i>            

     <i> Okay, wait.</i>               
     <i> So I could say also, like,</i>

         <i> "If you were</i>
