I missed you.

I missed you so much.
It's been one night.

[SNAPPING FINGERS]

Are we gonna go to school, or--
No.

I don't think we are.

No, we're just gonna stay... here.

[BOY YELLING]
Are you...

[BOY] Whoo!
I swear to God.

Whoo!
What are you doing?

Are you kidding me? Samantha!
You couldn't have just gone around?

Where was this energy
at my inauguration assembly, folks?

True.

to see any of you ever again, okay?

That's it. Signin' off.

Go, Crocketts!

[FEEDBACK SQUEALS]

Boom.

[GIRL] Principal Brown?
Oh...

Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?

I want to make the transition
of next year's student government

as seamless as possible,

so that when I'm up in New Haven--
Yale. You can just say Yale, please.

Well, our class's official policy
is to not discuss

where anyone is attending next year.

We don't want them to feel insecure.

Very thoughtful.

I need to go over the end of the year
budget numbers we have.


Gosh.

Really?

Like, now?

I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?
You know, please?

I mean, he's... you know,
he's the vice president.

Nick?

[BOY] Oh!
[LAUGHTER]

We both know that Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances.

That position is...

It's basically a popularity contest.
He's useless.

Ladies, it's the last day, you know?

We did it, huh?

We got you through high school.

Can't we just graduate,
head off to college,

you know,
celebrate this wonderful achievement?

Let's get through the day
without anything horrible happening.

Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?
Not subtle. We will persist!

Nick's like the great equalizer.

Delegates from every group of girls
are casting their ballots for his penis.

Oh, Triple A takes the lead.

Don't call her that.

Everybody calls her that.

She gave roadside assistance
to three senior guys last year.

getting degrading nicknames?

They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."

That's not derogatory,
it's a factual description.

7:20.
[MOLLY] Under eight minutes?

You're joking!
Aah!

Oh, my God. 9:43.

What am I gonna do
without you girls next year?

Nobody around here
even attempts the Thursday.

Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype
the puzzle every single week,

so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i>
Yep.

You know what?
Why don't I just give you two my number?

That way, you guys can call or text me
if you need anything.

Yeah! That would make our lives.
Yeah. Cool.

We'd love that.
Definitely.

I'll give you mine after.
I'll share the contact.

I can give--
I'll share it.

Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were
no cell phones allowed in class.

Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?
[MISS FINE] Hey.

A dollar in the swear jar.

I'm so sorry.
These shorts, they don't have pockets.

Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!
[BOY] Whoa, Triple A!

Oh, my God.

No spatial awareness at this school.
People just really don't.

Hey, Amy?
It's her!

Yeah?

Did you just score
your teacher's phone number?

Yeah.

Nice.



You should come party with us tonight.

Did you just ask Miss Fine
if she wants to party with you?

You think she wants to watch you
get drunk and break things?

Hold on. I was having a conversation
with her. You're not part of this.

I'm--
Sit down, Theo.


Just a last day present
for my favorite teach.

Jared, you are not my student.
I've heard great things.

And, hey, everybody else
got their graduation gifts, right?

Come on.

Jare Bear coming at you
from all angles, right?

Nobody asked for that.
Uhh...

Big me, littler me,
little baby Jared at the bottom.

Baby Jared says,
"Happy graduation, everybody!"

Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt
with your face on it, Jared.

Like, not even ironically.

Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause--

Jared, just go.

I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.
See you, Molly.

[AMY] Bye, Molly.
[JARED] I'll see ya.

[BELL RINGING]
Bye, Molly.

Why does he always do that?
[BOY] Fair townspeople!

Fair townspeople?

Fair townspeople, I swear to God!

[GIRL] What?
[CLEARS THROAT] Mark thy calendars

and make thy plans to attend
the drama department's summer program,

Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.


We will be performing the Bard's comedies
as modern tragedies

outside Whole Foods across town.

Well, it's actually funny. It's...

It's what we did in my summer program

last year in...
[SPANISH ACCENT] Barcelona,

when I lived in Barcelona.
[GROANS]

I will be directing,

and Alan...

may be starring, pending auditions.

I don't audition.

I'm offer only. [CHUCKLES]

This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna be here.

Yeah, Amy's spending the summer
in Botswana,

helping women make their own tampons.

That's...

gross.

Well, blood attracts lions.
I'm saving lives.

Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.
I, too, have a fear of big cats.

And I can't because I'm working
all summer, and also, I don't want to.

You are a philistine.

Why would you do theater
when you could do debate?

enjoy working with others.

And some of us know how to win.

Nobody's winning in that outfit.

[MISS FINE] Sit down, y'all.
We got work to do.

So, Molly...
Mmm?

Why don't you start us off?
Thank you.

[GROANING]
Kill it.

All right, well, as you might recall
from my analysis yesterday,

we were talking about...
It's our last day!

Let us live! God!
...submitting to authority...


You've gotta open your mouth
a little bit more, all right?

Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
Okay, chips!

All right, this is it.
[THEO] I gotcha. Ready?

Dude, how am I supposed to get there?
That was my bad.

Nick?
You're wild.

Nick.
Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.

Nick, there's some studentÂ government
stuff to go over.

Come on, man, aim for my mouth!

We have to go over the end of year budget,
so if you could...

Yeah, just, we're playin' this game
where I've gotta catch it with--

It's complicated.
I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.

I'm sure it's complicated.

Oh!

I cannot believe I lasted an entireÂ year
with Nick as my vice president.

He's allergic to work.
All he wants to do is goof off.

It's infuriating.

What? No.

Cool, cool,Â 'cause I'm...

'Cause I have so much to say--
No, no, no.

<i>â™ª Oh, baby, baby, do you-- â™ª</i>

Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[RYAN] Oh, dude.


[RYAN] It's all good.
Here you go.

Sharp elbows.
[CHUCKLES]

Not as sharp as your... chin.

What?

Um... so isn't it crazy
that it's-- it's the last day?

I know, dude. I can barely believe it.

Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?

His aunt went on a cruise ship
that broke down,

so Nick's gonna throw a party
at her house.

That's... that's awesome.

It's... it's all right.

They're, you know, they're stuck
on a boat shitting in buckets.

Oh, that's not really what I meant.

Oh, Jesus.

[RYAN] Come on, Tanner.
All right, well...

All right, I'll see you later.

I'll just, um...

Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

What are you doing? Go back.
Fuck, fuck.

No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.

I don't even knowÂ if she's into girls.

She wore a polo shirt to prom.

Well, that's just her gender performance.

It's different from
her sexual orientation.

I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

Well, gender is a construct of--
No. Thank you. That much I understand.

It's just... it's a little bit shocking

that... that you're into Ryan.

First crush, the little white cat
from <i>The Aristocats.</i>

You go from that to Avril Lavigne.

It just... it's not...
it's not what I anticipated.

I just like that she's...

always in a good mood,
and she's got a really cute smile.

She just seems like
she'd be a really fun person

to have sleepovers and lie around with.

Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

It's literally all we do.

Well, with her, there'd be more...

vagina involved.

That's fair.

She said Nick's having a party tonight.

Of course he would.
He's so fucking stupid.

Somebody always gets arrested
the night before graduation.

Amy, do you know how many girls
are gonna be up your vagina

at Columbia next year?
[SCOFFS]

Are you aware of it?
'Cause I'm aware of it.

Every time I come to visit you, you're
just gonna be scissoring a different girl.

Dude?

Scissoring is not a thing.

Don't knock it until you've tried it.
It's not a thing.

I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.
Don't knock it until you've tried it.

I said door-to-door.

Museum of death,
'cause its smog is killing us all.

Fuck!
You all right?

They spend every minute together.
It's so weird.

We spend every minute together.

We are equals.

Gigi just keeps Jared around
for when she needs a liver.

No, please don't get on my car.
I'm fucking spent, Jared!

At least take the heels off.
I'm fucking spent!

I just got it back from the shop.
Okay, shh! I'm napping.

Do you think it's true that his dad got
him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?

It's too weird of a story to be made up.

There's so many specifics.

He sprained his ankle,
she had a hearing aid.

What up, <i>chicas?</i>

It's intolerable.

You guys... you guys hungry?

I got... I got some soup dumps.

Keep it down out there!

They're probably soggy now,
but they're great cold!

Marry the sex doll, okay?
[TANNER] Right.

[THEO] Fuck the soccer ball.
[TANNER] Yep.



There's no other way, dude.

Like, I can't fuck her,
you know, 'cause...

when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.

And then, like, I can't marry her,
'cause, well,

I don't believe in the institution.
Uh-huh.


And I know it'll haunt me.
I'm a peaceful person.

That's very true.
[LAUGHS]

Wait, are you guys talking
about Molly Davidson?

Yeah.
Yeah.

[TRIPLE A] That girl is so weird.
She always acts like she's, like, 40.

Women in their forties know themselves.

Oh, she's cute,
you know, yeah, I give her that,

but she'd probably make you quiz her
on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.

Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed
with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?

That shit's like a filing cabinet
down there.

Well, I've got no problem
with a filing cabinet.

I would make passionate sex
to Molly Davidson.

Really?

Yeah, I'd just put a bag
over her personality.

[LAUGHS] Yeah.
[TANNER] That's it.

Molly's like a butterface for personality,
a butter personality.

[LAUGHTER]
[THEO] Yeah!


[TRIPLE A] It's so bad.
[THEO] Yeah.

That's cool, man. What?

Oh.

Oh, please, do not stop on my account.

Do you know what?
My vag is stuffed with diplomas.

Soon it's gonna be stuffed
with job offers,

and glowing profiles,
and commendations from the governor.

So, while you guys
were all studying AP hand jobs,

I was kicking ass and busting curves.

And I'm gonna continue to do that
at Yale next year.

So...

I like my choices,

and whereverÂ you three are next year,
I hope you do, too.

I'm going to Yale, too.

What?

I'm incredible at hand jobs,
but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.

No, you didn't.

I got in early.

To Yale?
Uh-huh.

Mm-hm?
[TRIPLE A] Mm-hm.

Mm-hm.

Oh, um, Tanner,
where are you going to school?

Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.

Stanford University? [CHUCKLES]
What are you guys talking about? That's--

No, yes, Stanford.
Mm-hm. Stanford University.

Hey, I'm not going to college.

I got recruited to go code for Google.

I mean, it's not Apple,

but the bennies are pretty tight, man,

and it's mid six-figures,
so I'm not complainin'.

That's my boy.
So proud of you. Amazing.

You failed the seventh grade twice.

Rule of threes.

You guys are serious?
[TRIPLE A] Mm-hm.

Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend
like I don't know you next year.

No offense.

Hmm.

This... this isn't possible.

You guys don't even care about school.

No.

We just don't only care about school.

Just tell me!

Okay.

This is obviously not helping.

We chose. We didn't party
because we wanted to focus on school

and get into good colleges.

And it worked.

But the irresponsible people who partied

also got into those colleges,
they did both.

So?

So we messed up.

We didn't have to choose. They did both.

We are the only assholes who did one.

Hey, we are not assholes, okay?

Let's just...

Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,

look at the memory box,

celebrate the end--
This is not a time to celebrate.

We have to go to a party tonight.

What?
Let's go to Nick's party.

No-- Are you kidding? No. No way.

Amy, we only have one night left

to have studied and partied
in high school.

Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls
that missed out.

We haven't done anything.

We haven't broken any rules.

Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.

One, we have fake IDs.

Fake college IDs,
so we can get into their 24-hour library.

Name one person whose life
was so much better

because they broke a couple of rules.
Picasso.

Yes, he broke art rules.
Name a person who broke a real one.

Rosa Parks.
Name another.

Susan B. Anthony.
Goddamn it.

Amy, I'm so serious.
They think that we're robots.

They think all we care aboutÂ is taking
a million APs, and getting into Yale,

and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,

and clerking for a federal judge
between junior and senior year

before eventually becoming
the youngest justice

ever nominated
to the Supreme Court of the United States.

In my case.

You get the point.

Nobody knows that we are fun.
We know.

They need to know.

Who's they?

We are not one-dimensional.

We are smart and fun.

We have to do this.

This is crazy.

We graduate tomorrow.

What if we get in trouble?

You know that we are too smart for that.

Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.

She wanted you to come.
You're finally gonna make your moves.

No, she's not...

You've been out for two years
and you've never kissed a girl.

I want you to experience this.

What will I be doing during that time,
you might ask?

I'm going to experience
a seminal fun anecdote,

and we are gonna change
our stories forever.

A down flip.

Well... what if I don't use my hands?

You can make yourself come

but I'd worry about paper cuts.

No. Can we just stop talking about this?

The panda. Whatever. Just...


Can we just stop talking about this?

Please, for the love of all things.


Just a quick Q.

What happened to her eye?

That fell off way before
anything happened between us.

Does she talk dirty to you?
Mm-mm.

Tell you about how she's endangered?
No!

Stop!

Stop!

I can't believe you didn't tell me

that you have been mounting
that tragic panda

every single night! [LAUGHING]

Yeah.
This is-- Honestly, it's exhilarating.

I thought I knew everything about you.

I think it's healthy for a relationship
to have secrets, and now we have one.

Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.

Uh-huh.
Yeah.

[WHISPERS] I once tried to masturbate...
Mm.

with an electric toothbrush.

But I got a horrible UTI.

Horrible.

Like...

horrible.

I wish that would have been a secret,
but you've mentioned it many, many times.

Hey. Hey!

I need you to do the talking.

Why don't you just tell them
we're going to a party?

Because they'll ask too many questions.
They'll try to call Nick's aunt.

I've never lied to my parents before.

You know when I lie,
I just add too many details.

Just make up a story, but don't say
we're having a date night or anything.

Why? It's funny
your parents think we're boning.

No, it's not,

because you're not the one
who has to deal with their creepy smiles

when I tell them
I'm meeting you at the library,

when I'm actually
meeting you at the library.

Honestly, it's surprising
that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,

considering their whole Jesus thing.

It's nice.

Yeah.

[GIRL] <i>Oh!</i>

He.. he just had too much milk.

Fuck! No one is answering.


We've never hung out
with any of these people

outside of academic activities.

They probably think we're calling
about school stuff.

You're right.

Can we just call a Lyft?

We still don't know where we're going.

Do you know a Lyft driver
that knows where Nick's aunt lives?

I think I do.

Who are you calling?

Don't worry about it, <i>chica.</i>

I'm so glad you called.

Sorry it took so long. Traffic was nerts.

I'll co-- I'll come...

It's like Guy Fieri's wet dream.

It's a means to an end.

May I offer you the front,
mademoiselle?

No? Goin' for the back? That's cool.

Back's great too.Â Great air flow
back there. Get on in there.

Okay. Time for some nights
we'll never remember

with friends we'll never forget, huh?

Jared, you know where the party is, right?

Absofruitly, ladies.

We are headed to the biggest, coolest
grad night party in town.

Can I get a what-what?

Jesus Christ.

No? That's okay. Maybe later.
It's over on the west side, so...

Get some tunes goin'.

[NERVOUS CHUCKLE] Hey, Jare.
Jared, we're just gonna hop out here.

Wait, what? Why?
[MOLLY] No.

She's kidding.
No, I'm not.

Our-- Our friend, she just texted us.

And she saidÂ she-- she--
she hit a possum with her car.

No! You know what kind of possum?
[AMY] Yeah. It's bad.

But the possum didn't die.
Its adrenaline and-- and rage

just made it start chasing her--
We are not hopping off. Keep driving.

What about the po-- Is she gonna be okay?
Wanna text her and see if she's okay?

Enough about the possum!
Jared, you took Spanish, right?

<i>Ah, sÃ­, sÃ­, mi bonita mujer.</i>

Don't move, don't inhale.
[JARED] All right.

Oh, shit.

There are drugs in my orifices.

Drugs.

Oh, no, that's...

It's not drugs.
That's just Gigi's vitamins.


Her... her what?

Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12.Â Gigi
likes to crush them up and snort them.

She says they work better that way.
We'll get you cleaned up on board.

What? What do you mean, "on board"?

you wanted to go to the best party.

So... I brought you to the best party.

Completely consensual bashing.
I don't know if that was clear.

"Prepared to get consensually bashed."

I'll have 'em change it.
What do you think?

You're serious, Jared? This is your party?

You don't wanna go
to Nick's lame house party. You don't.

A boat is international waters, right?

Maritime law.
Just come check it out for a little bit.

It's sick.

The catering company saidÂ it's
the coolest party they've ever been to.

And I'll tell you somethin'.

They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.

Up to you.
What are we thinking?

We still don't have Nick's address.
Mm.

Someone on board might know where it is.

And I'd like to meet someone
who met Sasha.

Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.

Yeah?

Let's go.

You guys excited?

I had the exact same thing.
Really?

I lost my virginity
in what I thought was a park, but...

it turned out to be a graveyard, and now
the ghost spirits live inside my eggs

waiting to be reborn.

That's not at all the same.

I always felt like we were similar.

Oof.

Hey. You can't smoke up here.

Oh...

I said it to you, you can't smoke.

We did it. Let's go home.

We have the address!
Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.

Oh, my score is...

you should really go. Seriously, go.

But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'
about doin' a detective novel.

You two will love...

Amy, you'll love this.
It's a, uh... a female detective.

Oh, really?
A lady detective.

Yeah, how about that?
Interesting.

Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.
Still workin'.

And, uh, you know, the baby,
whenever she's, like, close to a clue,

or, like, one of her hunches is,

the baby kicks,

you know, and the harder it kicks,
the closer she is.

We're gonna arrive right at the crest.

Before you know it,
you'll be neck deep in Ryan.

Neck deep in what direction?

You tell me.
I don't know. I don't know anything.

This is like your nightmare about
having to land a commercial airliner,

but much, much worse.

I mean, is it? Is it worse?

Well, yeah.

I had the lives of 100 people
in my hands.

My crew was counting on me.
I was their Sully.

I'm really stressed about it.
I-m-- Okay, I know you are.

If only there was just...

a video of people hookin' up.

Sorry, are you talking about porn?

All I'm saying--
No.

No one would know
if you watched one porn one time.

Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.

All of those women
are European trafficking victims.

Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging
other people's sexual preferences?

'Cause you fuck a panda every night.

What is going on?

It's a murder mystery party.

I've been planning it for months.
Wait, this is your house? Alan?

Alan, I was so clear in my text

My husband, Robert,
was an esteemed Broadway director

and the love of my life.

And he's been killed.

Like a dog in the street.

and grief.

I need you at a two.

you might as well take
some of the extra characters

since two people decided not to show up.
No--

Okay.

Adorable farmer new to the city.
We don't need characters.

We're not staying.
Hideous barrenÂ orthodontist.

Why am I barren?

Am I here to farm
or have I given up that life?

We have to stick to the plan.

Dude, nothing has gone
according to plan tonight.

Which is why we have to stickÂ to the plan.

Why are you being so pushy?

Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
You know who else was pushy?

Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,

Queen Noor of Jordan--
I know where Queen Noor is from!

Once we get to Nick's,
all of this will be worth it.

Just forget about about Nick's!
No one will even tell us where it is.

Why are you being so obsessed
with his party?

[GIGI] Because she loves him.
Oh, my God.

Gigi, stop doing that!

What did you say?
Molly loves Nick.

Can you please stop
repeating that sentence?

Because it's not true.

Molly hates Nick.
Thank you.

She projects disgust
to cover up a deep desire.

No. No. N-O. Thanks.

Uh, you actually... You drugged us
and tried to throw us off a boat.

I did. I did.

So nothing you say is of any value to us.

So-- Oh, you're...
[TRILLING]

Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off

because you should flip off,
so shut the fuck up.

[GROWLS]
Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?

George locked himself in the closet.


Dude.
[DOOR CLOSES]

No.

Dude?

No.

I don't like him.


classically, traditionally handsome
and weirdly charming,

and maybe my innate biology
registers him as an ideal mate,

and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize
about him sweeping me off my feet.

And some weaker people
might call that a tiny crush,

but I can ignore it,
I can fight against it,

because we all have weird interests.

And the important thing is
that we just... we shove 'em down

and we never speak about them again.

You don't have to shove anything down.


because I can't like him.

Maybe my body can like him
but my mind knows that that's stupid,

because he's just... he's a jock,

and all he cares about
is being cool and having fun,

and he doesn't even look at girls
unless they look like Triple A.

And he definitely doesn't want me
because I'm a butter personality.

How dare you say that
about my best friend?

Amy, you fucking slapped me--

If you ever say anything like that
about yourself again,

I will fucking lay you out, okay?

You are the strongest, coolest,

smartest, most stunningly
gorgeous creature

this high school and this Earth

has ever seen.

And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky
to be a footnote in your story.

So we're going to his party.

Are you serious?

I am dead serious.

If Nick's what you want,
then that's what you deserve.

How? How are we gonna find out
where the party is?

By doing what we do best.

Motherfuckin' homework.

make you sound older.

So you're basically children,

and you just willingly got in the car
of a strange man.

Do you guys have a weapon?

Yes?

If we claim to have a weapon,
this might be a felony.

Fuck.

Yes.
Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask

and trying to rob someone with no weapon.

'Cause the funny thing is,

I actually have a weapon.
[SCREAMING] Fuck!

Dear God, no! You have a gun?
Fuck! No!

I keep that to protect myself
from bad people,

something you guys shouldÂ think about.

Did the... did the possibility
of sexual assault ever enter your minds?

Not really.

Yeah, not really, I can tell.

You were spendin' more time on,
like, the hair

and that... that whole part of it,
maybe, yeah.

'Cause... 'cause we're like...
right by the freeway.

I could have you across the state line
in, like, 40 minutes,

take you to some cabin,
hog tie your ankles,

leave you in a room
with, like,Â a saucer of milk

and videotape the whole thing
for a couple days.

What?
What?

No.
Think about that.

What?
No, I'm not gonna think about--

We just need you to give us the address

to where you delivered
this huge order tonight.


Oh, shit, that p...


Okay, you know what?

Let me give you the address.
[GASPS]

I feel like if I don't...

[EXCITED GASPING]
...you guys are so stupid,

some dog walker's gonna find
your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.

Okay.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

Don't show me your pass code!
Oh, that's fair!

Okay, sorry.
That's the whole thing with pass codes.

I'm just copying the address.

That's your private information.

the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.

Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.

Fuck! I left my phone in his car!

Why did I have to use a visual aid?

Wait!
It's okay!

Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.
It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.

I'm at two percent?
Why the fuck am I at two percent?

Why is my battery so low?

The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.

Just-- Just-- Just call a Lyft.

No, I can't call a Lyft,

because if my phone dies and the driver
can't contact us, we are fucked!

Pick up, pick up.

Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're

Okay, wait, so what is this address
I'm taking you to?

It's, uh...
it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.

It's... It's... It's a party, technically.

You two want me to drive you
to an unsupervised house party?

Oh... well...

Good. I'm glad you guys are having
some fun before graduation. Uh!

[BOTH SIGH]


Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want
you guys to make the same mistake I did.

What do you mean?

I spent the majority of my 20s

overcompensating for the fact
that I never had fun in high school.

And, you know, the pendulum then swung
in a completely different direction.

I mean, I went crazy.

I had some really dark moments
there in my 20s,

like, some really dark moments.

Like, it was bad.
You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?

Like, not a single Jamba Juice,
like every Jamba Juice.

That came down from corporate.

Do you know how many Jamba Juices
there are in this country?

Like, a bajillion.

It's a national chain, it's a sensation.

I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go
ever again.

But, look, I don't want that for you.

Okay? You still have a chance.

I want you two to go to this party,
and I want you to have fun.

Because tonight is your night.

Yes! Yes!
Yes!

Okay.

Yes.
Yes.

So, what are you two wearing?

Uh, we were thinking...

uh...

Well, just this...

this-- this, uh... this look.

You do know you guys are matching, right?

We added this embellishment here.

Well, lucky for you two,
I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,

so I got a lot of shit in this car.

Why don't y'all go through
some of those bags?

I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?

Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.

Please get a change of clothes.
This night!

Excuse me?

Sorry, what?
I have nowhere to go with this.

It's too perfect.
You are literally glowing.

You've hit the level of perfection
and now I'm just--

Be still my heart.
You just came out of the water.

You're fresh from the water,
you're a mermaid here.

How are you so fucking shiny?

Can you fetch me an inhaler?
I can't breathe.

Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!
I'm physically unable--

Ow, my eyes hurt so bad
from your beauty.

Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.
[AMY] Oh.

Oh, sorry.
There's a... a party to get to.


All right.
I will see you two inside, all right?

Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.

[AMY] Just kidding.
Imagine if I just went in.

That'd be weird, right?

[LAUGHING]
That'd be so fun.

Anyway, see y'all later.

It makes sense to hook up in a car.

I'm not gonna, like,
suck a dick at my own home

where my father can walk in
at any moment.

Also, I wanna enjoy it. Fucking sue me.

That makes a lot of sense.

<i>â™ª Oh, lover â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You run from me â™ª</i>

You know what the worst part is?

All the fucking girls call me that, too.

<i>â™ª Like a bad scene â™ª</i>

I knew, like, Ben and Max
and Dick Splinter would say stupid shit.

<i>â™ª Oh, but please â™ª</i>

I just...

I didn't think the girls would, too.
<i>â™ª Please wake me â™ª</i>

Amy never called you that.

<i>â™ª For my love lies patiently â™ª</i>

I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry.

<i>â™ª Please, baby, please â™ª</i>

Just, like, please don't call me Triple A
at Yale next year.

<i>- â™ª And my love life waits for me â™ª</i>
<i>- </i>I just want people to know my real name.

Of course.

Annabel.

Fuck, dude, no, not right now.

I'm sorry. That was bad.

That wasn't my best.
Come on.

Jesus Christ.
That was embarrassing for me.

I'm sorry for that too.

Oh, my God.

You're right.</i>

<i>And it costs $71,000

Fuck you, dude.

Dude, you're in full-on jail. [CHUCKLES]

Yeah, I know.

I'm so sorry.


I'm gonna have to pay a fine
and go before the judge,

but we both--
No, I'm sorry.

Uh... I know women apologize too much,

but, in this case,
I have so much to be sorry for.

I was so selfish.

I-- I was being a coward.

You called Malala.

I lied to you, Moll.

You were trying to save me from seeing
Nick rub his boner all up against Ryan.

Oh, my God, can you believe that,
by the way?

No. Honestly, no.

I would have guessed
that Nick hooked up with Theo

before I would have guessed Ryan.

Nick and Theo do have great chemistry.

Divine. I mean, it's palpable.


I'm sorry I'm so controlling.

I just can't imagine my life without you.

You are the motherfucker who got arrested
the night before graduation.

Oh, my God, graduation.

Molly, what... what time is it?
You have to go.

Yeah, why do you think I'm here?
You're coming with me.

Dude, no, I am screwed. I can't leave.

You have to go.
Amy...

I am not graduating without you.

So either I get arrested
and I join you in there or we go together.

How?

We're gonna trade some information.

Because we have seen this man.

What?

[AMY] Is that Jared's car?
[MOLLY] I'll explain later.

[AMY] Am I driving?
Of course you're driving!

Need this. Go!
Oh, that was my fault!

'Cause we've gotta get started.
She kicks it off. Huh? Nobody?

'Cause I haven't seen her either
since yesterday

when we were at school, all of us,
at school together.

So, Molly warned me
she might be a little late

and tapped me to start her speech.

Molly is gonna be late to graduation?
Yeah.

That doesn't sound like her.
Right.

Well, uh, she also asked me
to remind you that... um...

um...

I got it, uh...

This sort of thing happens all the time
on the Senate floor.

And if a senator isn't present for a vote,

a proxy can call for a motion...
Okay. That does sound like her.

...for the vote to take place...
I got it. Thanks, Jared.

...in her absence.
Okay, so...

So she tapped you?

Tapped me.
Okay.

Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.
You're gonna kick it off.

Looks like Jared did a pretty good job.

Yes, he did.

[CHEERING]
Yes, he did.

Whoo!
Yeah!


I was so...

scared of you.

I felt like I had to prove
that I was better than you.

But really...

I don't know any more than you guys.

All I know is that
we have a lot more to learn.

'Cause this part's over.

And that's so sad.

But it was great, wasn't it? [CHUCKLES]

Things are neverÂ gonna be the same,

Please don't put your face on the face.

On the head, on the neck.
Not the nose.

Look who she's bringing.


Lingling?

No!
Oh, let me get in there.

No, no-- [GASPS]

Hm?

Why is she here?

Excuse me.

Amy, why is she here?

Hey.

Hey.

I figured I'd bring back your clothes.

Oh. Thanks so much.

I don't usually leave my underwear

that aren't my room.

Yeah, I figured.

So, um...

I think I'm gonna backpack around

Really?
Yeah.

Where?

I don't know. Honestly, anywhere
I can find a couch to crash on.

I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff
before college.

That's... that's really cool.

Me too, that's...
that's why I'm taking a gap year.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah.


have fun, nerd.

[HOPE CHUCKLES]

Um, well, if-- if you ever end up in...
in Botswana...

you'd have a couch to crash on.


Well, technically, it won't be my couch,
'cause I'll be staying with a family,

but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.
Okay.
