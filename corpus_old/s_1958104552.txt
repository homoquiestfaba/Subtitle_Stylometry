It doesn't?

No.

Yes.

And you must also take over

Shh. Come here.

Are we actually the Mafia?

Your grandfather

It can't be Fabrizio.

(MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES)
Oh.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Oh, so sorry, I must take this.

Oh, no, it's fine. It's fine.

Wait.
I will.


Let's try this again.

Oh, okay. (GIGGLES)

(GLASSES CLINK)

<i>Salute.</i>

(BOTH BREATHING DEEPLY)

Oh, Oh, yeah.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh, my God. If you told me
three days ago

that I would be in a
hotel room in Italy with a

handsome mob boss,

then I would say you are crazy.

But here I am!

Yes. Yes, but not for long.

Oh, don't remind me. I fly
home at the end of the week

and there's still so much
I wanna see.

I wanna go to
the Amalfi coast. Pompei.



Too bad you won't see
any of those things.

Oh, no? Why? Because we'll be
too busy making love?

Don Romano does not
make love to dead women.

What?

The poison I put in your drink

should be travelling
to your heart by now.

Oh, my God.
Soon,

your lungs will collapse.


(GASPING FOR BREATH)

Oh, my God. No...

Hey, Aldo!


(CARLO SHUSHES)
(KRISTIN SOBBING)

You are a Balbano.

My uncle killed your father.

One day you will come for me
and the rest of my family.

Eventually,
we all seek revenge...

like Vito Corleone.

I never saw <i>The Godfather.</i>

No! It was
<i>The Godfather Part Two!</i>

Okay, okay.

Stupid American woman!

Your family is in chaos.

Soon the Romanos
will be the only...


Southern family here...

in... in...


Are you okay?

Am I okay?

I'm okay.

Oh, my God.

(CARLO GASPING)
Right.

I switched our glasses
while you were on the phone.


It's just that you poured me
a way bigger portion

and I didn't know if
I was gonna like limoncello.

And I didn't wanna be rude because,

typically I don't
like lemon-flavored things.

I think it's because I took a lot of
lemon-flavored Augmentin when I was a child.

It's an antibiotic
and it's really disgusting.


(CRYING OUT)

(KRISTIN SCREAMS LOUDLY)
Oh.

Three years.

Ooh.
Ah.

(KRISTIN CONTINUES GROANING)

(HIGH PITCHED) Oh, my God!
What do I do?

What do I do?

Oh, my God, yeah, of course.

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.
Please, Jenny, please.

Please answer the phone.
Please, please God.

Oh, please answer. Okay.

JENNY: Sven. Yeah.
SVEN: (OVER PHONE) <i>Oh.</i>

(IN SWEDISH)

(IN ENGLISH)
Okay, think about it.

<i>- Okay, Jenny.</i>
Yeah. Okay.

Hey, hey.
Find any hot Italian men yet?


You fuck him yet?
Uh, he tried to kill me. And...


What? No, no, with poison. I...

A poisoned penis?

Slow down. Lorenzo did what?

No, no. Not Lorenzo. Carlo.

Wait, who the fuck is Carlo?

Oh, my God. He is this
super-hot mob boss

who I had dinner with.
But then he tried to poison me.

So, I switched our drinks.

<i>And now he's dead.</i>

<i>Could I go to jail for this?</i>

No. A little poison
switch-a-roo?

It's classic self-defense.

Oh, my God,
I killed a Mafia boss.

I am a dead woman.

(BREATHING ERRATICALLY)


(SCREAMS OUT IN DISGUST)
(MEN GRUNTING)

(BANGING ON DOOR)

ALDO: Everything okay
in there?


(GUNSHOTS IN HALLWAY)
Oh, my God.

(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

Oh, my God.

(BODY THUDS OUTSIDE)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Ah!

(DOOR OPENS)

ALDO: You are terrible
at playing dead.


Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God, it's you.

Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you so much.
Kristin, please stop.

Oh, my God. Thank you.

Is that a cannoli
in your pocket?


BIANCA: So you fucked him?
KRISTIN: No, he died first.

You missed something.

When he came,
he screamed like a woman.

You... Right.

Um, well, I guess
that might have been fun?

You took a shower?
Yes.

I took a shower because it
usually calms me down, but...

I've never seen
a dead body before.

And now I've seen three.
Three!

I mean,
I live a very boring life.

I am such a boring person.
I'm a boring woman.

Seriously, I don't do anything
with my life. I don't go out.

I just do everything
for everybody else.

Those monsters
will stop at nothing

until we're all dead

and they're the only family
in Lazio.

I have an idea.
I think I should go home.

I don't think I belong here.

Did you not hear me?
What?

If you leave now,
they will follow you

and they will not stop
until you're dead.


This is good.

How? How is this good?

This will send a message to the
Romanos that our family is strong.

You're the boss. And the boss
takes care of business.

You did good.

What? I murdered someone!

<i>- Brava.
Brava.</i>

No, no, no, no.

Do not <i>"brava"</i> me. I am bad.
I did a bad thing.

Oh, my God, I just want
my <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

What is he...

(CRIES OUT IN DISGUST)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(IN ITALIAN)

(GULPS NERVOUSLY)

Bruno!

(LAUGHS DIABOLICALLY)

BRUNO: Mmm.

(BRUNO CHUCKLES MENACINGLY)

(IN ENGLISH) We have to kill
those Romanos before they kill us!

And I mean on purpose!

No more accidentally
saving the day!

You could be a little
nicer to me, you know.

I just killed someone.

I'm a very good person.
I'm a good mother.

I would do anything for my son.

I do everything for everyone.

Even animals,
I can't even kill a bug.

I put it under a little cup,
and I take it outside,

and whisper, "Go. Be free.
Go live your life."

And I imagine them building
a new home and a new life.

How are we supposed to appear
strong when she is...

this?

These Romanos will never
negotiate peace on good terms.

Why are we negotiating at all? Why
don't we just give them what they want?

(MIMICS KRISTIN)

They want control
over all of our territories.

So, why don't we just
give it to them?

How do you expect us
to make money?

I don't know!

(BOTH GRUNT IN FRUSTRATION)

What is it we do, anyway?

FABRIZIO: Drugs.
BIANCA: Counterfeit bags.

FABRIZIO: Guns. Gambling.

Uh, so far I have heard
nothing that is either legal

or moral.

Because... (SIGHS) you know,

we are the fucking Mafia!

You... (GROANS)

Let him go. He just needs
to blow off some steam.

Oh, yeah? So do I.
I am completely overwhelmed!

This is supposed to be
my vacation.

What are you doing?
I'm confirming my date

with Lorenzo
because that was the deal.

But we are
in the middle of a war.

No. You are
in the middle of a war.

I am sick of doing everything
for everybody else!

I'm gonna do something for me.

You cannot be
in public right now.

Oh, I'm not going to be
in public.

I'm going to have dinner
at his place.

He is simple and adorable.

And... I just wanna be
alone with him.

(IN ENGLISH)
These are my cousins.

I come from
a very conservative family

and they wanna protect...

my virtue.

(IN ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) I guess it will
be a family affair. Please.

Okay. Thank you.

It's good to see you.
It's so good to see you.


Hi. Thank you for having us in
your home which is beautiful.

Welcome to my aunt's place. - (GASPS)
Oh, my God, it's totally magical.

Yeah.

Who is this? He looks like
such a naughty little hobbit.

Yeah. It's my uncle, Ernesto.
Oh.

He recently died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Yes, we are.
That's why I moved in.

Oh, I see.
But I am

naming my own pasta line
this year.

This is your pasta line?
It is.

Oh, my God, that is so exciting.

You guys, look at this.
This is his.

(SOFT ITALIAN MUSIC
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

Oh, Lord in Heaven,
I have never eaten

homemade pasta before.

Mmm, so good.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

You know, it's... it's nice

to be with a woman
who appreciates my cooking.

Yeah. My ex never did.

Ah, she sounds like a monster.

Oh, no. I didn't mean to
bring her up again. Forget it.

No, it's okay. I get it.

I mean, my husband,
my ex-husband

was a total man-child.

I mean, he made everything
about himself.

And his band
and his cheesy lyrics.

That sounds horrible.

(ESMERALDA SPEAKING ITALIAN)

I'd convinced myself that

his passion was more important than mine.
Like an idiot. (CHUCKLES)

But even with our son,

divorcing Paul, I swear to God,

it was the best decision
I ever made.

Oh, you have a child?

Yes! Yes, I'll show you.
Here he is.

There. That's Domenick.
He's my baby.

He's a really good kid.

(BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN)

Last bite.

For me?

The most precious. Yes.

Okay.

KRISTIN: Oh, your pasta.

It's the greatest thing
I've ever had in my mouth.

Uh-huh.
Yeah.

(IN ITALIAN)

Are your cousins okay with this?

Yeah, they're fine.
Just kiss me.

(MOBILE PHONE BEEPING)
Shit. No, no, no.


I've got this work Zoom meeting.

Oh, my God. Cousins!

I have to go. Rain check?
I'm sorry. I just...

It's a really
important meeting that I...

I totally forgot about it. Um...

Thank you for having us.
I will call you.

(ALDO SPEAKING ITALIAN)

KRISTIN: I can't believe this.
Stupid work.

I'm enjoying myself
for the first time in years,

and I have to do this
dumb work Zoom.

Come on. Quit your job.
You are a boss now.

Oh. I can't just quit my job.
People are counting on me.

DANTE: Hmm.
ALDO: Ma.

(IN ITALIAN)
(WOMAN SHOUTING OVER PHONE)

Ma.

(IN ENGLISH) Are you okay?
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)

My mother had
another dizzy spell

and she has no more medication
now. Okay. Okay?

She can't afford it. The SSN doesn't
cover these new American drugs.

(IN ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH)
I know a pharmacist.

We go tomorrow, okay?

No, no, you should go tonight.
Go take care of it tonight.

Yeah, but we must protect you.

He is right.
No, family first.

I'm okay. I'll be fine.

Oh, Kristin.

Would you mind to put this

into the fridge, please?
Yes, sure.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

Come on. So late.




Oh.

I can't wear this.
Oh, what am I... Oh, God.

(KRISTIN STRUGGLING
WITH CLOTHES)

Ugh, right. Uh...

Come on, hurry, quick, quick!

(KRISTIN SIGHS WITH FRUSTRATION)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Okay.


(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

<i>Hey, nice of you
to finally join us.</i>


the time difference
is a little crazy, so...

HANK: <i>So, where are we
with Restylane?</i>

Right, yes, okay.
Um, so first:

Restylane makes women feel
great about themselves, right?

So, I was thinking
we open on a woman

<i>alone, drinking some fine wine,</i>

<i>longingly perusing
a travel brochure.</i>

Mmm. I'm not really hearing
anything that pops.

I mean, you know, you gotta grab
them in the first few seconds.


Hey, you know who's
really great at this?

Just riff, give us some of
that Randy magic.

Go ahead and mute her.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

All right.

Help me!

And I'm just spitballing,
all right.

But I'm thinking,
woman on a jet-ski?

Aw, that's fresh.

Yeah, but how do we get there?


We open up on this attractive
but, you know, older woman.

Not too old, right?

Help me!

No, no, no, no, no, please.

I'm thinking tight, hot, early forties
type role, you know what I'm saying?

(BREATHES HEAVILY)
Oh, my God.

You are much more attractive
than your grandfather.

Oh, my God.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GROANING WITH DISGUST)

No! (MOANS) No, no!

So, you know,
she minding her business,

walking through the desert
like people do.

WAYNE: That's a great
metaphor for a tired woman

with a face
that's so marked by time.

Mmm.
(DOWNWARD WHISTLE)

Sit down!
(GUN COCKS)

(BREATHING IRREGULARLY)
No, no, no. Please don't.

Please don't hurt me.
Please. No, no.

Oh, God, no. No <i>entrata.</i>
Absolutely no <i>entrata.</i> No.

You like <i>salsiccia e friarelli?</i>

No. No sausages. I'm strictly <i>vegetariano.</i>
No, thank you.

Very spicy.

Spicy? Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. No!

Please, no. Please don't. No.
(BRUNO EXHALES PASSIONATELY)

Please don't.

No, no, no.

Fucking belt.

She looks lonely. She looks...

She looks her age, bro.
She does.

No woman should look her age.

(EXCLAIMS, GROANS)

Crotch! Eye!

Crotch! Eye!
(BRUNO GROANING)

And like a blessing
from the heavens,

the sky opens up
and it starts to rain.

Then she looks down
and she realizes,

"Oh, my God,
I'm on a jet-ski."

Restylane Lyft
gives her a second youth.

WAYNE: Yeah.
A return to life.

I love that pose.

Crotch! Crotch!

Eye! Crotch!
(BRUNO SCREAMING)

Restylane Kysse plumps her lips.

Crotch! Eye!

<i>Rejuvenated.</i>

(EXCLAIMS)
(BRUNO GROANS)

WAYNE: You got water,
you got wetness.

Whole lot of wetness.

(BOTH GROANING)

Fuck you!

When was the last time
you saw a thigh gap like that?

Fuck you, Randy!

Now she's kissable.
Oh, fuck you, Wayne!

Wow.
Oh, fuck you, Hank!


And you,
you fucking creepy pervert!

Fuck you!
(FLESH SQUELCHES)

(SCREAMS, SHUDDERS)

RANDY: <i>And then she just
rides off into the distance.</i>

<i>- Soft, youthful...</i>
(LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF)

<i>And wet.</i>

(RANDY SIGHS)


HANK: <i>Randy, that was superb.</i>
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Okay.

See that, Kristin?

<i>That's how it's done.</i>

<i>Unmute.</i>

<i>Kristin.</i>

Hey, tell me
you heard Randy's pitch.

Oh, Kristin?

Are you drunk?


Oh, man. I really hoped
this day would never come

but I'm gonna have to
let you go.

By the way, you have some
pasta sauce on your face.

<i>You know what?</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>

Whoa!
That's gratitude for you.

Highly unnecessary.
Toxic.

Oh, God.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)


(DOORBELL CHIMES)

(ROMANTIC ITALIAN

(TAPPING ON DOOR)

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
KRISTIN: Hmm?

BIANCA: You left quite a mess
at the villa.

You need to tell us
when things like this happen,

so we don't have to worry

whether or not
you are currently alive.

Oh, fine. So, next time
someone tries to murder me,

I'll be sure to let you know.

<i>Grazie.</i>

(IN ENGLISH) Now, the Romanos
want to meet today.

Oh, so they can
try to kill me again? Huh!

I thought once you'd had sex,
you would calm down a bit.

Hey, I've been here two days

and I've been almost
murdered twice.

That's one per day.

I'm gonna need a lot more sex
to calm me down!

I know a man.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH)
Stop with your cousin, please.

They're prepared
to make some concessions.

We have the upper hand.

They've agreed
to a public meeting.

Fabrizio will be there with you.

I can't be there
because it's only family.

Fine. But I wanna meet
at La Bottega del Gelato

because it has
a five-star rating.

And I never have gelato.
And I have been dying to go!

But we have...
That's an order!

KRISTIN: Mmm. Mmm!

Look, I am tired of this war.

Oh, my gosh,
Tripadvisor does not lie.

My family is tired of this war.

It's got to stop.

MAMMONE: We couldn't
agree more.

You killed our boss,
and our best killer.

All by yourself.

Does your offer
for Formia stand?

Yes. <i>Absoluto.</i>

So, we are at peace
then, Mammone?

(IN ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) We are at peace...

Donna Balbano.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(CARLO'S SONS

Oh.

(ALL SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH)
Well, there you go.

another scoop?

(MOBILE PHONE BUZZING)


(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(KRISTIN CHUCKLES)

(IN ENGLISH)
You really impressed me.

Oh, yeah, the meeting

went better
than I thought it would.

Because you terrified them.

Last night
was a true work of art.

You have rage, Kristin.

Wild,

passionate, deep rage.

I like it.

(CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY) Okay.

You know,
it wasn't just blood on Bruno.

It was mushy, thick.

Bits of his scrotum
were stuffed in his eye socket.

Mmm.

And that's why
they listened to you.

Because he had bits of his
scrotum stuffed in his eye socket?

Maybe.

And that's how
you earned <i>rispetto.</i>

You'll fit
right into this family!

Give me your hand.

What, uh...

Oh, no. Oh, no,
you don't have to.

Yeah.
You should... No, no.

Oh, it's too big. I don't...

KRISTIN: Mmm.

Yeah, it fits pretty well.

And now...

give me some "grrrr."

Be the leopard!

What, uh...

(PURRS)
No, no. (GROWLS)

(HACKING GROWL)
No, no, no.

No fur ball.
No espresso machine.

Just... (GROWLS)


(BOTH GROWLING)

This one. This one. This one.

Bye.

Okay. Thank you.


What the fuck?

Are you kidding me?




Oh, Bianca.

You know, a month ago,

I was feeding the homeless
in Long Beach.

I mean, I help old people
cross the road all the time.

I am a good person.

Of course you are.
You made peace.

Yeah, but at what cost?
I feel like Michael Corleone.

You saw the movie?

No. I read
the Wikipedia summary.

Kristin, the world isn't
black and white.

Your grandfather
took care of my family.

He put my mother through school

and gave us shelter and food.
Huh.

And bought me this leg.

I owe him everything.

My point is, just because
you're a Mafia boss,

doesn't mean you have to be
a bad person.

Right. Right.

Wait, what did you say
about your leg?

When I was 13,
a truck hit my Vespa.

Oh, my God!

All the kids made fun of me.

Oh.

But Don Balbano came
to our house with a big box.

And he brought me
a prosthetic leg.

It changed my life.

Wow. I mean, jeez, I...

I didn't even...
(HOLLOW CLANG)

Couldn't tell. Looks so real.

Precision Swiss technology.

Upgraded every five years.
Huh.

So, Kristin, I'm living proof

that you can do a lot of good
with the power you have.

It's not about losing yourself.

It's about becoming yourself.

But if this isn't
what you want, you can leave.

I can?

You made peace.

You can go home
to your old life.

To the old you.

Oh, no, I don't wanna go back
to that me.

I don't like that one.
No, I don't think so.

Then what do you wanna do?

Well,

we're involved in an
import/export business, right?

Mmm-hmm.

KRISTIN: Hmm.

I think I have an idea.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

KRISTIN: <i>It's a win-win,
right?</i>

<i>Because we keep prices low</i>

<i>and we sell medications
to people in Italy</i>

<i>that they can't usually find
at a reasonable rate.</i>

Because it's not just
about profit.

It's about
helping people, right?

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

I was just thinking.

We've been together
a few months now

and I have never
been to your place. (CHUCKLES)

You're still quite secretive.

I am not secretive.

I'm not. Come here,
I'm gonna take a photo

of us and the <i>Vaticano.</i>

(CLEARS THROAT) Right. Ready?
Okay.

Yay.
Yay.

There. Okay.
And now I am posting it.

Immediately. There.

There we are. Done.

Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

(MOBILE PHONE BUZZING)

Nicky. Oh, my God,

I miss you so much.

Who's the dude?

Uh, he is my pasta teacher.

We're just out
buying double zero flour.

Okay. I gotta go to class.
Um, I love you.

I love you.

Pasta teacher?
Honestly, I just feel like

you're not telling me something.

Oh, really?
Don't you trust me?

Stop it.
Don't you trust me?

Don't even joke.

You can tell me anything.
(SIGHS)

I love you.

(SEAGULLS CALLING)

Oh, my God. Paul?

Your Paul?
That Paul?

Get off me! Who the hell
are these guys?

What the hell
are you doing here?

I flew here to find you.
I saw your Insta.

Dammit. I post
one stupid photo.

(PAUL WHIMPERING)

than I imagined.

And I imagined
someone very weak.

Who's Paul?
I'm her husband!

No... (SIGHS)

You are married?
No, we are separated.

Look, I can see you're
a pretty handsome guy

and you've been having
some great sex...

Dante, please take him
back to the villa.

Come on, Paul. Let's go.
What, what? Let me go.

So he gets to go
to your place, but I can't?

No, it's not like that. No.

You told me you were divorced.

Well, we may as well be.

He's a horrible husband
who cheated on me.

No. No.
No, I mean...

It's taken me
so long to trust again.

And I really care about you.
No, no.

I... I care about you.
I care about you so much.

Then let's be honest
with each other.

Is there anything else
you are keeping from me?

(ALDO CLEARS HIS THROAT)

Hmm?
Um...

Oh, my God. Um...

I'm so sorry, I really do
have to go deal with this.

Okay? I'm sorry.
Sure, go.

It's okay.
I'll see you.

KRISTIN: God dammit, Paul.
DANTE: Just stay back!

PAUL: (MUFFLED)
I need to pee, please.

What did you guys do?
I shut his mouth.

He's very annoying.

PAUL: I need to pee.
I can't hold it.

Okay. Okay.

Nice and easy.

Actually, Dante, can you grab
some baby oil and Q-tips?

I think it'll be...
Ow!

Dammit! I was just
getting over a cold sore.

The cheater does not
deserve your care.

You told these people
about Tracy?

What the hell is wrong with you?

Hey. Hey.


No one talks to her that way.
Show some respect. Huh?

To Kristin?
(SPITS)

Ew. Kristin, do something.

Why are you so nice

to this <i>stronzo?</i>
(GRUNTS)

How dare you call me something

I don't even know what it means?

Who the hell are these people?

They are her best
grape squashers.

And I'm the label maker.

Yes. I am a vintner now.

You make swords?
Wine, <i>stronzo.</i>

I'm gonna look that word up
as soon as I get outta here.

Why are you even here?

I hadn't heard from you.
I was worried about you.

I miss you.

(KNUCKLES CRACKING)

Okay.

Okay, fine.

After you lost your job,

our joint bank account is empty.

(SCOFFS)
So, I figured, you know,

since I'm your husband,

I should probably come
live with you in the villa.

Oh, my God. It all makes
perfect sense now.

You only came here
to get something else from me!

Go home, Paul.

Actually, you only had enough
points for a one-way ticket.

(SCOFFS) Pathetic.
He's not worth it.

What did you see in him?

Just take my card and...
Kristin, no.

Don't!

No, you're better than this.
You're right.

I should just book it myself.
No, Kristin.

That's not what we meant!
That's worse.

Fine. Fine.

Paul, you're a grown-ass man!
(DANTE LAUGHS)

Figure it out yourself!
There you go.

Own your power. <i>Brava.</i>

(ALDO SPEAKING ITALIAN)
So, take him to the airport!

(PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING)

You've been stress

grape gathering all night.
(SIGHS)

Stop worrying
about your imbecile husband.

He'll find his way home.
Or he won't.

No, it's just that, you know,
Paul hurt me so much

over the years
with all the lying.

And I don't wanna do that
to Lorenzo.

But you can't tell Lorenzo
about this part of your life.

I know. I know.

But what if it wasn't
part of my life?

What are you saying?

I'm saying...

I want out.

But the family heads
are meeting today.

I'm not allowed at the table,

but you and Fabrizio
have to be there.

Okay, perfect.

Well, that's where
I'll announce my resignation.

But you can't just leave.

Actually, yes, I can.

You said,
once I made peace, remember?


You believed me.
(SCOFFS)

I knew you wouldn't go back
to your old sad life.

Besides, that was before
you created all this beauty.

The pharmacy business.
Helping people.

I know. I just wanna
give Lorenzo a chance.

So, you're willing
to give up all of this

for a man you barely know?

What? We've been
dating for months!

Have you farted in front of him?

Well, like a tiny little...
(IMITATES FART)


He didn't hear it.
But, you know,

he did fart in front of me once.

But, really,

I've made up my mind.

Fine.

I just hope
this is what you want.

Never let a man dictate
who you are or what you can do.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

MAMMONE: (IN ENGLISH)
Thank you all

for joining us today.

We called this meeting

to discuss
your pharmaceutical business.

Yes.

Hello, everyone.
I'm Donna Balbano.

And I brought
a little something special

for everybody today.
(SNAPS FINGERS)

(CASE UNLOCKING)

Ta-da! I made muffins.

I know you may not
wanna eat them

because of the whole
poison thing,

but please remember,
we are at peace.

See? Mmm.

Poison-free muffins. (GIGGLES)

I just thought
it would be really nice

to break bread together.
Kristin!

My bananas were going bad...
Enough!

And I needed to use them.

Your business is causing
quite the problem for us.

I deal with
pharmaceuticals, Mammone.

I'm not touching electronics,
or your cars.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

But all of our business

has to pass by the inspectors.

And the inspectors
are on your payroll.

(YELLING IN ITALIAN)

Hey, listen, listen. I could
talk to the inspectors.

I have a great rapport
with them.

The damage is done.
We are losing a lot of money.

You must pay
a percentage of your business.

Actually, now is really
not the best time.

I was hoping we can keep
all this beautiful peace

that we've been enjoying.

You know, I'm alive.
You guys are all alive.

In fact, these muffins
are kind of a parting gift.

I'm planning on
stepping down shortly.

(MEN MURMURING IN ITALIAN)

Oh, I'll be leaving you
in very good hands.

Bianca will be taking over

as the new boss
of the Balbano family.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

Your secretary?

She is so much more than
a secretary.

(ALL LAUGHING)
You have no idea.

Nice joke.

You think you can
fuck us all over

and leave?

No.

It doesn't work like that.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

Let's all calm down.
I'm not fucking anybody over.

(IN ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Lorenzo?
Oh, my God, you're a cop?

Not fucking us over, eh?

(IN ITALIAN)

(FEMALE OFFICER
SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Weapons down,

Aunt Esmeralda?

(LORENZO SPEAKING ITALIAN)

DANTE: Kristin! Kristin!

(KRISTIN SCREAMING)

No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

Kristin. Kristin!

Let's go!
Okay.

Stay low.


(GANG MEMBERS CLAMORING)


So, you were just using me
this whole entire time?

My parents were gunned down

by the Mafia
right in front of me!

At my soccer game.
After I missed a goal.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(ALDO AND DANTE YELLING)

Uzi.

(ALDO AND DANTE REPEATING)


I was assigned to this case...

So I'm just a case?

What about your marriage,
and your ex, that's lies?

Mostly.

And who the fuck is Esmeralda?

You mean Maria? She's my boss.


I am Rodolfo.
Rodolfo?

Yes, but you can call me Rudy.

Rudy? I'm not
calling you anything.

(ESMERALDA YELLING IN ITALIAN)

(CRIES OUT IN PAIN)

Mama!


(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

Oh, my God.
Are you even a pasta maker?

We were gonna run away together.

We were gonna open a restaurant.

I was gonna make the wine,
you were gonna make the food.

I was gonna get fat
and you weren't gonna care.

It was gonna be heaven!

How fat?


(IN ENGLISH) All clear!

Get away from me.

Please. No, no, Kristin,
please. (GROANS) Kristin.

No, I am not talking to you.
We are done.

Uh, no, Kristin.

I'm arresting you.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry for this.

(GANG MEMBERS CLAMORING)

Come on.

(DANTE AND ALDO SPITTING)

I...

(MELLOW ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You...

have a finger in your hair.


Stick it up your ass!

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)

WAITER: Ciao.

KRISTIN: <i>So...</i>

This is your first trial, right?

Mmm-hmm.
Oh, good for you.

(LAUGHS ANXIOUSLY)

JENNY: Wait. Wait.

Excuse me.
KRISTIN: Oh, my God, Jenny!

Kristin.
(EXCLAIMS)

Don't say anything.
Thank you so much.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness. Hey!

Take your hands
off of my client!

Give me that. Give...
(WOMAN WHIMPERS)

What are you, still in diapers?

Bianca called me.

You didn't think I was gonna
let my best friend

rot in an Italian jail, did you?

I saw the Amanda Knox doc. No.

Oh, my God.
How did they get out of jail?

Not enough evidence
to charge them.

Right. And what about Bianca?
Where is she?

It's better for you
if she's not here.

Okay, got it.


That Lorenzo?
Yeah.




(SINGING) <i>What a dick!</i>
(KRISTIN GIGGLES)

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

(JUDGE SPEAKING ITALIAN)

PROSECUTOR: <i>Signora Giudice,</i>

(IN ENGLISH) today I will show that Ms.
Balbano has taken over

the criminal enterprise
of her grandfather,

Giuseppe Balbano.

Madame Judge,

<i>Signora Giudice,</i>

I will show you that my client
simply came to Italy

to pay her respects and found

that she had
inherited a vineyard.

Now, was my client
seen in a room

filled with questionable people?

Sure. But only to tell them
that she wanted no part of it.


Giannina,

could you tell us your
dealings with the I<i>ndagato.</i>

Well, everyone else
calls me "waitress,"

<i>cameriera,</i>

but she calls me by my name.

She likes my bonsai tree.

She tells us
we are her best vintners.

She makes us feel appreciated.

So, we repay our gratitude
by being her bodyguards.

DANTE: We go with her
at the meeting

because they want to hurt

sweet woman.
(SIGHS)

They are very, very,
very bad guys.

Look what they did
to the poor Dante.

How long was this
undercover operation of yours?

Well, I've been investigating
Giuseppe Balbano for years.

When I met the <i>Indagato,</i>

she'd just landed in Italy
for the funeral...

And when did you start having

sexual relations with my client?

I ask the questions here!

And when did you start

having sexual relations
with the <i>Indagato?</i>

About...

one day after.

But she was asking for it.
(JENNY GASPS)

Okay. I mean, not...
I mean, not asking.

But she said this trip
was her "Eat, Pray, Fuck."

The book is <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

You took advantage of
an innocent winemaker

and sullied
a literary masterpiece.

You gross.

I came to this country

at a time in my life

where I
completely doubted myself.

Then when I arrived here,

I discovered that
I had inherited a vineyard.

It was shriveling

and dying...

much like me.

So, I nurtured it.

And I came to realize

that I inherited so much more
than a vineyard.

I inherited an opportunity
to fulfil my purpose.

So...

I inherited me.

Thank you.

I don't need to hear
anything anymore.

I've made my decision.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH)
No grounds to proceed.


He's gonna give me a ride home.

<i>Bravo!</i>(CHUCKLES)


Kristin?

Kristin, wait, wait,
wait, wait...

Congratulations.

Well, I just wanted you
to know that it wasn't all lies.

I really did
fall in love with you.

And I still love you.


I thought I was listening
to my heart.

But it turns out

I was just using another man
to validate me.

And for the first time
in my life...

don't give a shit.

Oh, my God. Dante. Dante.

Oh, my God,
those goddamn Romanos.

(ALDO EXCLAIMING)

Oh, he's losing a lot of blood.

Here, I've got this thing.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We need to get him some help.

(MOBILE PHONE BUZZING)

Oh, God, who is this?
(ALDO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

It's Bianca.
She's in the winery.

Oh, my God,
she's been shot, too.

Uh, uh, okay, you stay with
Dante and I'll go to Bianca.

Wait, wait, wait.

(COCKS GUN)
Just in case.

Bianca?

What? Nicky.

Bianca is dead.
(KRISTIN GASPS)

DOMENICK: Mom.

FABRIZIO: I knew
you'd come back

if your precious
Bianca texted you.

Drop the gun.

And kick it to me.

Good girl.

KRISTIN: What are you guys
doing here?

FABRIZIO: You can
thank your husband for this.

He lured your son here to...

something about guilting you

into taking him back.

Look, I was worried
about you, Mom.

Oh, honey.
(MOCKINGLY) Honey.

What do you want?

Are you serious?

I want to be the head
of the Balbano family!

(FIRES GUN)
I told everyone I'm leaving.

And leaving it all
to fucking Bianca!

Hey!

Really, Paul? You're just
gonna waddle out of here

and leave our son sitting there?

(STRAINING)
Whoa, whoa!

No!

Don't you dare touch my kid!

(BOTH GROWLING)


Mom, look out.

(GUNSHOT)
(BULLET WHIZZES)

(MACHINE WHIRRING)


I've been shot. It burns.

You have terrible taste in men.

No shit.

Paul, untie our son

and get the hell outta here!
Untie me.

Babe, this knot is impossible.


(BITES)
(SCREAMS)

Paul. Here, take this.
Yeah? Okay.

Keep it pointed at him, okay?

Yeah, it's heavy.
(CLEARS THROAT)

Are you okay?

Yeah. Are you?

Oh, God, I'm so happy
to see you.

I've missed you so much.
How are you?

Hey, hey,
I loosened the knot, right?

You're a baby.

I'm not a baby, you're a baby.

You're a big, fat, podgy baby.

You're a big, stupid,
blonde baby.

You're a baby with big poop
in your diaper.

Mom!
Don't move!

Bianca, you're alive!

Of course I am.

No, no, no...

Fabrizio is a terrible shot.

FABRIZIO: Wait, wait, wait.

I saw you die.

You saw me take a bullet
like a woman.

But there is a fucking
major artery right there.

Wrong leg, idiot.

(YELLS IN ITALIAN)
(HOLLOW CLANGING)

BIANCA: High tension steel.
It's fucking cool, man.


I did have to re-adjust it.

That's why it took me
so long. Sorry.

Oh, honey,
I'm just glad you're okay.

<i>Grazie, amore.</i>

(CRIES OUT) I'm hit again.

Dad, come on.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

(BULLETS WHIZZING)

(BIANCA CHUCKLES)

KRISTIN: Bianca,
take care of my kid, okay?

Make a break for the door.

I'll cover. Now!

PAUL: Come on, Nicky.

Come on. Come on.
(GUNSHOTS)

Go, go.

Help me, Nicky.
Come on.

(LOUD METALLIC CLATTER)

FABRIZIO: Drop it.

(GUN CLATTERS)

You think you can just
come here and take over?

This is mine! All of it!

I earned it!

Uh, you didn't earn anything.

I'm the one
who had to come over here

and clean your mess up.

Oh, please.

Oh, yeah.
I am the one who made this

awful wine fucking delicious.

Yeah, me. This.

I have done more for this family

in the last three months

than you have your entire life.

And yet you feel entitled
to be the boss?


(BOTH CURSING IN ITALIAN)

(GROWLS ANGRILY)

(FABRIZIO SCREAMS)

Oh, my God. Uh...

Oops. Are you, uh...

I guess
it's a little rusty, huh?

I should get this fixed.

Help me!

Please. Please, cousin.


(BOTH STRAINING)

Say it.

What?

Say I'm the boss.

Never!

Then, as the boss,
I'm gonna have to let you go.


I've always wanted to say that.

You can't do it, can you?

Hey. Hey, stop! No!

No!

KRISTIN: Whoo-hoo! (CHUCKLES)

(ALL MOANING IN DELIGHT)

That is crisp.

You know, this Balbano wine's

gonna get me
into some serious trouble.

Blackout Jenny is coming.

All right, all right, sweetie,
you should get going.

Heard you got shot.

Yeah, I got shot, too.

I got, like, five stitches.
Oh.

How about you?

Twenty-seven stitches.

And they left the bullet
in my spleen.

You wanna touch it?
No. Put it away.

Oh.

I wanna touch it.
Mmm.

Now, come. Show me around.

You know, I never realized
what a badass you are.

You know, neither did I.
(BOTH LAUGH)

Domenick, there's something
I need to tell you.

Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

Are you okay?
I know it's a lot to take in.

I was just held hostage...

at gunpoint.
(SIGHS)

Divorce is fine. Yeah.

Come here.
I hate saying goodbye to you.

I'm gonna miss you.

Yeah, but I'll see you
next week, Mom.

Uh, yeah.

Love you.
Actually, um...

I've been
thinking about it, and...

I'm gonna stay here.
Seriously?

Yeah. Balbano Wine's
really taking off.

And for the first time
in my life,

I'm doing exactly
what I wanna do.

Yeah, but are you sure
it's safe here?

Aren't there a lot of people
who, like, wanna hurt you?

No, that's not a problem
any more.

(MEN CHATTERING)

But you're not like,

you know...

I make wine. That's all.

A vintner?
Yeah.

I wanna stay here

No.

Call me.

(DANTE SPEAKING ITALIAN)

<i>Grazie,</i> Donna Balbano.

(KRISTIN IN ITALIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Oh, shit.

Uh, Nicky. Wait, wait, wait.

I made you some trail mix
for the flight.

And don't forget
to put on your sweater, okay.

It gets chilly on the plane.

I love you.
You, too.
