Alright dude, time to get up.

Come on, Rigby.

Dude, get up. We got to get ready for work.

Okay. Okay.

Dude, this is so cool.

I never got a job that got you a place to live.

I never even had a job.

Yeah, about that.

I kinda told them you'd be a good idea to hire,

so can you try not to do the whole "Rigby thing".

"Rigby thing"? What do you mean?

I mean you're lazy.

What? I'm not lazy.

Dude, you were lazy to fill up the application for this job.

That's why I have to do it in the first place.

Just cause I was too lazy to do something boring

like filling in a job application doesn't mean I'm lazy.

Okay. Okay. Look.

Let's just both promise that starting right now

we're not gonna do anything to screw this up. Okay?

Okay. You think there's breakfast stuff in the kitchen?

Only one way to find out.

...Milk.

...Cereal.

...Combine.

This is the only clean spoon left dude.

Let's play "Punchies" for it.

Okay. Me first.

Take it.

Man,

so far this job is awesome!

I still can't believe we get our own rooms!

Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in them.

I had to sleep on the floor last night.

Will yeah I mean.

We could get some stuff for by earning some money. You know?

I guess.

You want some milk.

Yeah.

Please don't eat up in the table like that.

Like what?

Oh my. I never seen anyone eating cereal like that.

How quaint!

Yeah, well they shouldn't be doing that.

That's what the bowls are for.

Oh, they're fine!

...Did you see that chair? - I love chairs...

Hey, Pops! What are you doing with that chair?

Oh, well. I no longer require its services.

So, Benson & I are taking it to the place

where the big man-made come upon & wisk it away to magic trash city!

We're throwing it away.

Aw, what?

Yeah, why would you throw that thing out? It looks awesome.

Can we at least check it out, before you chuck it?

Yeah, can we at least check it, before you chuck.

Oh, that would be fine.

Look, I gotta get back to work.

You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

Aw, man this chair is awesome.

Look how awesome it looks.

Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

I'm gonna sit in it.

Good idea.

What? What's wrong?

Dude, this is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

Aw, what? Let me try it.

Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

I purchased it through the post and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

This is terrible.

Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, come on, baby!

It's just not comfortable, man.

If you ask me, I think we should throw it away.

Oh, well, yes, that's what I'm on my way to do.

Hey, Pops. Since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

No, let me have it! - I asked him first.

Come on, Pops! - No, Pops, me!

Well, I don't think I know who to give it to.

But if you two can settle it between yourselves,

then you're more than welcome to have it.

Yeah, let's play punches.

No way! I'm not playing that game with you anymore.

If we're playing for something like that chair,

then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

How much skill?

Rock paper scissors.

I adore rock paper scissors.

Although where I come from, we called it quartz parchment shears.

Alright, how do you wanna play it.

Are we go in a one-two-three go?

Or one-two-three, shoot on three?

Let's do it on three.

Alright, fine. But let's stretch first.

I don't wanna put my ham or whatever.

Okay.

What's up with the new guys?

They're ready to play quartz parchment shears for my old Silounna.

Nice.

You know who else gonna play quartz parchment shears for your old Silounna?

Who?

My mom!

See? I told you I was gonna say it!

Ready?

Oh, my!

Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

Benson, come quick!

Quartz parchment shears and they already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

I have work to do.

And they shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

Whoo, an evil game.

Two ties.

You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby!

I already know what you're throwing before you even throw it, baby!

That's not even possible, baby!

Come on!

Good show, jolly good show!

Everyone come quick!

The most amazing game of quartz parchment shears is happening right now!

No, no!

99 ties in a row!

Enough!

Why are we even doing this?

You don't even think this chair comfortable.

So? neither do you!

Dude, I was lying.

I was just saying that, so you wouldn't want it.

I was lying also, I love that chair.

Well, then I guess it's too bad that after I win it.

I'm never letting you sit it.

Then finish it!

Since no one can decide,

and all these playies tied 100 times,

I take it upon myself to eat your prize.

What's that?

Come on, let's go!

This is all your fault!

How is this my fault? I just wanna play punches.

The chair!

The Rigby!

Oh, dear!

Hello? Hello?

Please someone come quick!

Quartz parchment shears' gone terribly wrong...

Pops, where are you?

Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

Idiots.

Skips!

What did you do?

They're playing rock peper scissors. Grab on!

Don't you know that's an evil game?

Hold on, everybody.

Hold on, everybody!

Hold on, every... Rigby!

What do we do?

You have to break the tie!

Rigby! We have to in this. I'm gonna throw rock!

Yeah, right. - I'm not kidding!

Hurry up! Do it now!

Did you win?

I think you win.

It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on that chair anyways.

Look!

Oh, cool!

No, you don't.

You're not getting that chair.

But here's what you do get.

You get to flip that cart back over.

You're throwing that chair away, and then you're cleaning up this whole mess!

Pops, you're coming with me, and you two idiots,

if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, You're fired!

Geez, I can't believe it... - But... Benson, I...

Okay.

Starting now, let's both promise not to do anything to screw this up.

Agreed? - Agreed.

Rock paper scissors for who gets to drive the cart?
