All right.

Are you ready for one more?

<i>â™ª I had a girlfriend â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She said she loves me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She likes to hold me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She once told me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause she don't mind</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª Nothin', nothin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She don't mind</i>
<i>Nothin', nothin'</i>â™ª

You with the band?

Yeah. Record label.

-You better put that on.
-Yes, sir.

Whoa.

<i>â™ª Nothin', nothin'</i>â™ª

Guys, cleanup on aisle seven.
What's up, man?

Hi, Leo. Keep playing that thing,
you're gonna go blind.

Matt, where are we on that sit-down
with Elijah?

-I told you, talk to Zeke.
-Zeke said talk to you.

They want the cover.

Jeff won't commit
until he sees the article.

But it's a definite possibility.

Gotta go, Leo.

Come on, Matt.
Is he gonna do it or not?

It's a "definite possibility."

We love you, New York!

-What's up, man?
-Good to see you too!

What's up?

What's up, man?

Elijah. Got a visitor.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-Great set, man.
-Thank you.

Yeah.

-Did you talk to him?
-Not yet.

-Would you talk to him?
-Talk to me about what?

Talk to me about what?

Elijah just signed with Interscope.

What?

Are you fucking joking? What's going on?

You're just slow, man.

"I'm slow"? What do you mean, "I'm slow"?

-He doesn't mean "slow."
-He said, "slow." Shut up, okay? -What do you mean?
-I haven't had a record out in a year.

So? You're gettin' ready to cut an album.
We just booked a studio.

Look, Interscope's got two songs
ready to go.

And they're fuckin' good.

But they're not yours.
I thought you want to do your own stuff.

We've been telling you for a while now
that we need a new single, okay?

Jesus. Elijah, come on, man.

I got nothing but love for you, man.
Really.

It's not personal.

Yeah.

Good morning, Eve.

Morning, Matt.
Hi.

-Does she know about...
-Everyone knows. Can you pull Elijah's sheet
when you get a chance?

-Thanks.
-Matt Ryder's office. This is Kim.

I'm sorry. Mr. Ryder is in a meeting.
Can you return?

-Thank you.
-Shit. His numbers were holding.

-Rob Marker's office. This is Kim.
-Rob Marker's office?

I'm sorry. I don't have him right now.
Can you return? Great.

-What the hell was that?
-Marker's been promoted.

Really?

And Mr. Lepselter
actually wants to see you right now.

Sit down.

Am I about to get fired?

Sit down.

I've been working for you since
before you could make payroll. Ten years.

I've kept you on at a loss
for the last few.

A loss? Really? Okay.

I brought you a Coldplay demo in '99.
You didn't even listen to it.

Arcade Fire in 2003.
A bootleg and you were like,

"Great in concert.
Won't translate to the airwaves."

Three years ago, I had the Spare Sevens
in the room. In the fucking room.

I blew a few good calls for you. So?
You been cashin' that chit in for years.

I know music better than anybody
in this fuckin' office.

Yeah. You've got a great ear.
That made you irreplaceable in 1998.

-Bullshit. It still matters.
-Music is a commodity.

And it's airborne. You can't protect it.
You can't sell what you can't protect.

You only sellÂ the artist.
You haven't been signing any.

Last night, you let your meal ticket
walk out that door.

Yeah.

Yeah, well...

I'm still working 'em.

-Working who?
-Spare Sevens.

-Spare Sevens?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Right.

Hey, I'm not jokin'. No, no, no.
They're not happy at Sony.

The label rushed the last album.
They're pissed.

The Spare Sevens
are about to pop globally.

Sony will make them happy.

No. These guys aren't like Elijah.

They actually take the time to make music
the way real bands used to make it.

I talked to their manager, Dan, at PMO.

-You have a sit-down?
-I will.

I'll give you two weeks.

Not because I owe it to you,
but because I want the Spare Sevens.

Hello.

You have no pictures.

Like, on your walls and your desk.
You don't have any photos.

Who doesn't hang up a picture?

Good question.
Who are you?

Most people in the office have photos of
their wife, girlfriend, dog. Something.

Well, my wife left me, don't have
a girlfriend, and I'm afraid of dogs.

I'm sorry to disappoint. Excuse me.

<i>Yes?</i>

Hi. There is a strange woman
standing in my office.

-<i>On my way.</i>
-I am not strange.

-You're a little strange.
-I work for Ben.

You work for Ben.
Okay, that's great.

-I don't know who that is.
-Benjamin Asher Ryder.

Your father.

Sorry, I'm Zooey Kern.

I'm Ben's nurse/personal assistant.

Listen, Miss Kern. This has already been
a monumentally shitty day,

and I haven't started dealing
with the West Coast.

Hey, Kim!

Not sure what you're doing here.
Honestly, I don't care.

Ben's dying.

Right. See, I thought I covered that
with "I don't care."

He has liver cancer.

And he's got three months left,
maybe four. Sorry, Matt. I was in with Marker.
Miss, do you have an appointment?

-Wouldn't you know if she did?
-It was rhetorical.

I need you to show this woman out. Okay?

Then get ahold of Dan Summers
at PMO Talent.

I want to talk to him
about the Spare Sevens.

Actually, just say that it's urgent.

-Rob Marker's office.
-Are you kidding me?

I'll just call security myself. I don't think you actually have security.

No. No, we don't.

Are you familiar with Kodachrome?

Yes. Paul Simon, 1973.
What do you want to know?

Not that. Kodachrome film.

Your father shoots on Kodachrome. He
prefers his pictures to be projected...

...with light rather than printed.
I know his spiel.

There's only one place left in the world
that processes Kodachrome,

and that's Dwayne's Photo
in Parsons, Kansas.

But Kodak decided to
stop manufacturing the dyes,

so after next week, it'll be impossible
to develop Kodachrome film.

-Amazing.
-Your fatherÂ found four rolls

he shot a long time ago,

and he never got them developed,
and it woke something up in him.

He's decided he's going to have
one last show.

How about that? Good for him, okay?

This has been very, very... annoying.

-Let me show you out.
-Can I just...

Ben needs to get these rolls to Kansas,
and he can't fly in his condition.

If only there was a service
that delivered overnight.

-Yeah, well, he doesn't trust FedEx.
-Of course not.

You're his nurse/assistant/whatever.
Don't you have a driver's license?

-Yeah, I do.
-There you go.

But Ben wants you to drive him.

I'm gonna try to explain this
as clearly as possible for you.

I've not spoken to the man
in over a decade.

There's no way in hell I'm going
to Kansas with him. Or anywhere.

Come to dinner tonight.

I know I'm talking. I can hear my voice.

Matt!

He's dying.

You should go see him one last time.

There'll be a car waiting for you
downstairs.

Hey, Matt. Larry Holdt, Ben's manager.

Yeah, I remember you.

The last time I saw you,
you were still a teenager.

That's great.

Well, maybe we should get inside.

He's in there.

<i>â™ª You're so good â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You get me high â™ª</i>

<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- â™ª You're so good for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're so good for me â™ª</i>

I didn't think you'd come.

Those look familiar.

Well, they should. They're yours.

You wanna bang it around a little?

-No, I don't play anymore.
-That's too bad.

'Cause you used to be pretty good.

Sorry for the smell.

You know, the meds they give me
give me gas.

So, Matt...

Larry tells me things haven't been going
so well for you at the record label.

I was telling Ben that record labels can't
find a sustainable business model.

You told me that he was gonna be
out on his ass any day now.

Jesus, Ben.

-Where'd you hear that?
-Larry knows everything.

-Behave.
-I'm dyin'. I don't have time to behave.

Come on. That's bullshit.
You were a prick long before cancer.

That's true enough.

At least you two are talking.

This is good.

So how much time you got left?

Depends on which doctor you talk to.

I'm betting tits up by New Year's.

Why did you get divorced? She catch you
in flagrante with some other babe?

-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-You catch her?

Because you fucked around on Mom
doesn't mean everyone does.

Pace yourselves.

Your mother and I had
a complicated relationship.

Complicated by you putting your dick
in every woman you met.

Your mother forgave me.

-Yeah. Well, she died alone, Ben.
-So will I.

-Yeah, but you deserve to.
-Hey.

It's okay.
We're just... just catching up here.

People change.
No, they don't.

Why don't we talk about the trip?

I can save us all a lot of trouble here.
I'm not going on any trip.

You are a desperate old man.

Tryin' to what?
Manufacture some bullshit redemption?

Why?

So you can pretend your empty, selfish
life was anything but meaningless?

Thanks, but no thanks.

Just so you know, when you are dead,
no one's gonna care that you're gone.

I mean, maybe these two,
but you pay for them.

-Hello?
-Matt, Larry Holdt.

-Hey, Larry.
-<i>I want to discuss...</i>

Come on, man.

<i>Matt, don't hang up.</i>

-Not gonna change my mind, Larry.
-<i>I know.</i>

<i>I'm gonna change it for you.</i>
You are? Really? How?

<i>Spare Sevens. I can get you a sit-down.</i>

-Go on.
-<i>Their manager used to work for me.</i>

<i>He says you've been calling all day.</i>

They're going to be playing in Chicago
in a few days. Some radio station thing.

<i>You can swing by on your way.</i>

Wait. Hold on.
What do you mean on my way?

You're talking about Kansas, yeah?

Look. I don't know
how to make this any more clear.

That's just not going to happen.

Look. Ben needs the show,
and you need that meeting

<i>And trust me.</i>
<i>This is the only way you'll get it.</i>

I'm not going to go with him, Larry.

It's not happening.

Please, don't call back.

Fuck.

Good morning, Matthew.
Glad you reconsidered.

So what's up with the Sevens?

Show's Saturday.

I'll make arrangements
for a meeting afterwards.

Still drive that?
You fix the roof yet?

I'm sorry.
Would you like to take your car?

-I don't have a car.
-Then that settles that.

The car runs fine, Matt.

You're going too?
Unless you want to give me my shots.

-Is that okay with you?
-Fine with me.

-All right.
-Let's go! We're burning daylight.

<i>In two miles, merge onto I-80 West.</i>

Do not text and driv<i>e</i>, please.

I'm not texting. I'm looking at texts.
There's a difference.

Hey, this car doesn't have an iPhone jack
or anything like that, does it?

We're strictly analog here.
Some cassettes in the glove compartment.

<i>In 1.5 miles, stay</i>
<i>to the right to merge onto I-80 West.</i>

Zooey, hand me that thing for a second,
will you?

Yeah.

-What the hell are you doing?
-Like I said, strictly analog.

We gotta drive halfway
across the country.

That's right. I'm not gonna have
some robot bitch whinin' in my ear,

sending me on some sterile interstate.

We have a week to get to Kansas.
We're taking the scenic route.

We're going to use this map here.

-Remember what a map is?
-Yeah. I know what a map is.

-Turn that up, will you, Zo?
-Yeah.

Love this song.

<i>â™ª You've already burned it down â™ª</i>

-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

Ben, you're here.

There's a diner across the street.
We should meet up later and grab dinner.

That sounds like a plan.

Yeah, you guys go ahead.

I'm just gonna get in a quick workout,
make it an early night.

Hey.

Don't give me that look.

Okay. You know what?
You need to let your guard down.

-Excuse me?
-Yeah. I know you're scared.

Scared? What am I scared of exactly?

You're scared to open yourself up to him.

You're scared to let yourself
love him again.

-Wow.
-Don't.

Wow, that's amazing.
Yeah.

Yeah, I mean forget therapy
or the facts of my relationship with him,

you spend six hours in a car with me,
and you've cracked the code.

-You don't have to be a dick.
-No, I don't need to be a dick.

I need to be...
less scared to let him in.

Or let him into...

-I'm just saying...
-I'll mull it over.

You made the effort to come.

You may as well
try and get to know him a little bit.

Watch your fingers.

<i>â™ª I'd like to hold your hand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But your hand isn't here anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd like to see your eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But your eyes do not see any longer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want to walk with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But our walks do not exist any longer</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª No, your eyes do not see anymor</i>e â™ª

<i>It was 1998 or so,</i>

and I was in the White House doing
a spread on Clinton at Bill's request.

It was right after the whole, you know,
bullshit impeachment circus.

Bill was trying to prove...

You're calling
the Lewinsky scandal bullshit?

He cheated on his wife
and lied to the entire country about it.

They all cheat. They all fuck around.
You should know that.

-Ben.
-What? After the way your marriage ended?

-You're seriously gonna sit here and...
-Stop.

What? Just because Matt's here.
Don't be an idiot.

-If anybody knows about fuckin' around...
-Hey, you need to stop talking now.

-Leave her alone, okay?
-It's fine.

I do believe Matt here's defending you.

Just go back to your bullshit stories
about you and your fancy friends.

What we're seeing now is jealousy.

Envy and resentment of a man living inÂ the
shadow of his father's accomplishments.

Yeah, you've had a great big life.

Yeah. You're damn straight I did.

Where are all those friends
while you're dying?

-Matt.
-Alone?

Stop.

My work will live on long after I'm gone.
What have you done?

Holy shit. Look at that, man.
She's gotta be 250 pounds or something.

That outfit's beautiful.

Can you just try and take it easy on him?

Me? Are you kidding me?
I was defending you.

You know, a month from now, two months,
he's going to be gone forever.

No, I get it, okay?
I understand the concept.

It doesn't give him a free pass
to be an asshole to people.

'Kay.

I'm going to go back to the motel.

Boy.

Fucking...
Here's your check, hon.

Yeah. Thanks.

<i>â™ª Yes, IÂ understand</i>
<i>That every life must end</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª As we sit alone</i>
<i>I know someday we must go, â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm a lucky man</i>
<i>To count on both hands the ones I love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Some folks just have one</i>
<i>Yeah, others they got none, â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stay with me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's just breathe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Practiced on our sins</i>
<i>Never gonna let me win, â™ª</i>

What? What's funny?

When I was a kid,
my mom used to take me up to the Poconos

for a few weeks every summer.

After we'd pass a few of those
deer crossing signs that just went by,

I remember I asked her,

"Mom, how do the deers know
that's where they're supposed to cross?"

I was being serious. I was a kid.

But she just laughed her ass off like
it was the funniest thing she ever heard.

That felt great, 'cause...

I don't remember her laughing much.

When did she die?

I...

When I was 13.

I'm so sorry.

After that I moved out of New York to
live with my aunt and uncle in Cleveland.

Ben was...
He was working in Africa at the time.

He didn't even make it back
for the funeral.

There was a civil war going on.

I'm not making excuses. I'm just...

saying if you think you had it rough,
just spend some time and effort.

I'll remember that.

We should go see him.

Go see who?

Your Uncle Dean.
Cleveland's only an hour away,

and your "Spare Sister's" thing
isn't until tomorrow night.

I wouldn't mind seeing my brother...

one more time before I leave this planet.

Yeah, but...

Dean hates you.

He doesn't hate me.
He's just pissed off at me.

<i>â™ª Nothing you would take</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª Everything you gave â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hold me 'till I die â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Meet you on the other side â™ª</i>

I'll be damned.

Hi, Dean.

You dyin'?

-What? Is it that obvious?
-Well, you're here.

Yes, I am

It's good to see you

-Matt, what are you doin' here?
-Hi. That is a long story.

Yeah, I bet.

-And who's this?
-This is Zooey.

-Yep, Zooey.
Is that Matty?

Nice to meet you.

-Hi!
-Hey.

Ben.

-Hi, Sarah.
-He's dying.

Well, not in our driveway, he isn't.
Bring him on in.

And you!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

Sorry. It was a last-minute thing.

-Hey! Hi!
-This is Zooey.

Matty. Well, now she's more like it.

I mean,
I told him not to marry the other one.

-No, I, um...
-Zooey is Ben's nurse.

Because your auras are conjoined.

-I could see that immediately
-Yeah. Yeah.

Aunt Sarah here can see auras.

-And she can hear sarcasm.
-Of course she can.

-You guys are gonna spend the night?
-If that's okay.

Great.
Matty, you and Zooey take your old room.

-But we are... not together.
-Nope.

Hi.

-Hey.
-This was your room.

Yeah. Basically, seventh, eighth grade
through high school.

God, you were really into music.

Yep. They say it's the one thing
I inherited from Ben.

Actually, I would say that
the only memories, or good ones,

at least, that I have of him
were listening to music.

We had this little den
and this old Fisher stereo.

I mean, new at the time, but...

He'd let me play records
when he was goin' through the slides.

So, while most kids had people
singin' 'em lullabies to sleep,

I had Graham Nash singing "Wounded Bird."

Let's see what we have here.

Ooh! Pearl Jam. Radiohead.

-Nirvana.
-What can I say? I was a moody kid.

Yeah, you can tell a lot about someone's
past from the music they listened to.

Then I guess you know a lot about
my past now.

What do you think I listened to?

Very interesting question.
Okay, I'll bite.

But in order to do this
to the best of my ability,

I have to actually figure out
your exact age, so... excuse this.

This might be a little rude.
What are you? Twenty-eight?

-I'm 30.
-You are?

-Yeah.
-Hey.

-Thank you.
-Dodged a bullet there.

So that means you were
a freshman in college, like, in 2000.

So then you were into... Sorry to say, but you're a product
of your environment. Top 40.

I'm talking Britney, Christina,
boy bands, N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys,

maybe Alanis when you're feeling dark.

-Please give me some credit.
-But then...

But then you started to rebel against
your middle-class suburban values.

Is that what I was doing?

Or possibly
you met a guy into alternative music.

Why do you assume that I changed
for a guy? Maybe he changed for me.

No, no. Guys don't change for girls.
Not in college at least.

-When do they change then?
-Much later.

Usually when it's too late.

You started to listen to bands
you thought would make you edgier,

but you're still hopelessly mainstream.

You're sittin' there in your dorm room,
and you're listening to...

Live.

Like who live? What live?

-No, the band, "Live."
-I don't know of a band called Live.

Live. You know. Like...

â™ª <i>I alone want you â™ª</i>

I actually could not name a single song
that the band Live had.

What about "Lightning Crashes"?
Everyone knows that.

<i>â™ª Her placenta falls to the floor</i>â™ª

My God!
What?

People know it because it's the only
pop song with the word "placenta" in it.

You're really bad at this.
I was a weird, sad punk.

-It was the Smiths, Pixies.
-But you loved Live.

-Yeah, I loved Live.
-Biggest fan. Live's biggest fan.

No, I'm not wrong.

-This isn't bad.
-What?

Galaxie 500.
Yeah.

-Obscure.
-Indeed.

-Does your record player still work?
-Fucking better.

Let's take it for a spin.

<i>â™ª My head will turn to yellow</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª My eyes will turn to green â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My voice will turn to mellow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But still I can't be seen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Melt away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want to melt away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Melt away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want to melt away â™ª</i>

How is Hank? Is he married?
Is Hank married yet?

-Yeah.
-Yeah. Couple of years now.

-Have any kids?
-Not yet, but...

You know, they're so young.
There's no rush.

So what's so special about
these photographs

you need to drive halfway
across the country to get them developed?

It's some of my early work.

Stuff I shot years ago.

What happens if you get 'em back,
and they're garbage?

How do you even know what's on them?

I remember every shot I've ever taken.

That's, like,
hundreds of thousands of photos.

-You remember all of them?
-Yep.

That's impressive.

When's my birthday?

February 19.
February 19.

You got it. Yeah.

-Last one.
-Thanks.

It's good to see them together again.

It's good to see you with him.

I don't know. He left us.

Hell, he left you guys too.

Now he's dying, so he comes back,
and we're just lettin' him back in.

It's like he's getting away with it.

Matty, look at him.

I mean, does that look like a man
who's gotten away with anything?

Okay, I'm gonna...

I'm gonna go upstairs.

Try and get a little work done
before I pass out.

Can I take this, put wine it,
and drink it in my room?

-Help yourself.
-All right.

-'Night, sweetheart.
-'Night.

-I'm so glad you're here.
-Me too.

-I love you.
-Love you too.

Hey, guys. I'm going to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

-Okay.
-All right.

-You good?
-Yeah.

Yeah, no, I'm just a little tired.
Gonna get some work done.

I'm glad you're making this trip.

A man should know his father,
no matter what kind of bastard he is.

You should come back here more often.

-I know. I'm sorry.
-That's okay. End of the lecture.

-It's good to see you.
-Thanks.

Yep.

-Hey, I saw...
-Hey.

that your light was still on.
I got you a glass of water.

-Thanks.
-Yeah.

I know those guys can drink, so...

Thought that might help
the cause in the morning.

-How are you?
-Good.

Is it hard being here?

Um...

-Sorry. Do you want to come in?
-Yeah.

No. I mean, me, no.

-Um, can I sit down?
-Yeah.

Not weird for me. I guess
the weird thing would be...

you know, seein' Ben here. Is a little, you know, odd.

Um...

Sarah... thinks you're beautiful.

Okay. Cool.

You are though.

-I think you're drunk.
-No.

Maybe. I might be, actually.

But I'm not saying this 'cause I'm drunk.

And I'm not gonna not say it

'cause I think you'll think
I'm only saying it because I'm drunk.

I don't know what we're talking about.

You didn't follow that?
No.

Then maybe I am drunk.
'Cause I followed it perfectly.

This is a bad idea.

-What? We're just talking.
-Yeah, well.

Then you have to talk about the fact that
you're just talking and not just talking.

Right.

Wait, I'm sorry. I mean...
! Whoa.

My God. I'm so sorry.

Holy shit.

-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

I guess I deserved that.

Thanks.

Hey, close your eyes.
Are you gonna get weird?

No. No. Just close 'em.

Okay. They're closed.

Hold on a sec.

Okay, you can open 'em now.

Wow. That's really cool.

Yeah, my cousin Hank
was really into astronomy.

Yeah, I can tell.

What, um,Â  Ben was saying...

...last night at the diner
about your... ex-husband?

Is that what happened? He cheated?

Nothing good comes from reliving the past.
You know?

You just sound like my ex-wife now.

She used to say that I'd...

I had a tendency to live in the past
rather than... embracing the present.

Is that why she left you?

It's never... one thing, now, is it?

What about you?

I don't know.
It all just happened so fucking fast.

One moment we're just...
we're cruising and then...

the next we're driving off a cliff.

The funny thing is, I actually...

For a moment there,
I thought I had it together, you know?

I thought
I was someone to be reckoned with.

My God, Ben. Jesus.

Help. God.
Ben, what did you do? Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah. I just...
I just got dizzy, and I tripped over...

the corner over here.
I was gonna take a shower.

Wait for me before you do that.
Can you move your fingers? Toes?

Yeah.
Any dizziness or nausea?

-Do you have any pain?
-No.

Bend your leg for me.

Wait. Stop gropin' me. Jesus Christ.
What are you doin'?

I need to make sure
you don't have broken bones.

-Help me up.
-I got you.

Here you go.
God. Jesus Christ.

-You don't feel pain anywhere?
-No.

-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

My God.
I'm all right. -

I'm fine. I just need to sit here
for a couple minutes.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

Thanks, baby.
My God. Gave me a heart attack.

Hot coffee?
Yes, please. Thank you.

We should be able to get to Chicago
by late afternoon at the latest, yeah?

That'll give us five days to get to Kansas
before the lab closes.

So you two are screwing now.

I mean, it makes sense.
He's low-hanging fruit sexually speaking.

You haven't been laid in what?
Three years?

-How about we shut up now, okay?
-You like your women damaged.

-You like to damage yours.
-Okay, that's enough. Both of you.

I didn't damage you. Did I, Sarah?

-What's he talkin' about?
-Ben.

-Sarah, what's he talking about?
-Nothing.

A million years ago before
we went on our first date. Nothing.

What? Did Sarah never mention that?

I can understand why.
It wasn't really very memorable.

Mostly just a lot of dry humping. Had
a couple drinks and couldn't quite get...

Shut your mouth, Ben.

Though God knows
she tried every trick in the book.

-Shut up.
-Dean!

What are you gonna do, Dean?
You gonna come over here and hit me?

There's nothin' left to hit.

Christ.

-What is your fucking problem?
-Can we just calm down?

I'm not gonna calm down.
Can't watch him shit all over my family.

I'm just bustin' his balls
for Christ' sake. He's my kid brother.

He was more of a father to me
than you ever were.

I was just busting his balls.

Drama.

Doesn't anyone else
see how ridiculous it is?

I mean, don't get me wrong.
You're a really good looking girl, Zooey.

You're even sexy in a sloppy kind of way.
You got full lips, nice skin, great legs.

And I guess, you know,
Matt's in decent enough shape.

He's got no glaringly bad features.

Judging by my own modest dimensions, I
doubt he's packing a python in his pants,

but I'm sure it's
a perfectly adequate cock in a pinch.

You're thrown together by circumstance.

Neither one of you has demonstrated
any ability

to sustain any kind of
meaningful relationship.

To the contrary, you're both
especially dysfunctional in that regard.

It's going to become very awkward
when this situation... goes south,

and it will.

-I mean, look at you.
-Shut up.

Okay? Just shut up.

Nothing happened.

-Nothing happened?
-Nothing!

You were alone in a room.

-She's drunk.
-I wasn't drunk.

-She's coming on to you.
-No.

Every star in the sexual galaxy
is lined up. You couldn't seal the deal?

What do you need?
Landing lights between her legs?

Thanks for that.

-Thanks for that!
-Well, no offense. It's just...

It's just disappointing. That's all.

Well, really sorry to disappoint you.

Are you ever happy, Ben?

Let me tell you something.
Happiness is bullshit.

It's the great myth
of the late 20th century.

You think Picasso was happy?

You think Hemingway was?

Hendrix? They were miserable shits.

No art worth a damn was ever created
out of happiness. I can tell you that.

Ambition, narcissism, sex, rage.

Those are the engines that drive
every great artist, every great man.

A hole that can't be filled.

That's why
we're all such miserable assholes.

So you know you're a miserable asshole.

What? Do you think I'm an idiot?
Of course I know.

'Course I know.

<i>â™ª Come â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Husk your limbs to my floor â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bones sucking stones â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her coming storm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Under the lights you went</i>
<i>Chemical ashes head down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Heart on a diamond thread</i>
<i>Fennel and lashes wet down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh, ooh, â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh, ooh, â™ª</i>

You would have saved us all
a lot of trouble if you shot digital.

You ever hold a pair of fake tits
in your hands?

What?
No matter how good something looks,

you can't beat the real thing.

People are taking more pictures now
than ever before.

Billions of 'em.
But there's no slides, no prints.

They're just data,

electronic dust.

Years from now, when they dig us up,
there won't be any pictures to find.

No record of who we were, how we lived.

What's the point of having an artifact
if you never see it with your own eyes?

You still talking about film?

Never mind. Hey, Matt, Matt.

I don't kid myself that I was
any kind of husband or father.

It's not about that.

You just never saw me.

Not once, Ben.

I see for a living, Matt. It's what I do.

We better get going.

Hey, we just got to the hotel in Chicago.
Thanks for the passes for tonight.

<i>I have you booked in St. Louis</i>
<i>tomorrow night, then Kansas City,</i>

<i>-then Parsons for Tuesday.</i>
-Okay.

<i>That gives you two extra days</i>
<i>before the lab closes.</i>

Hey, look, Larry, I'd rather just go
straight from St. Louis to Parsons.

I just want to drop off this film
and get back to my life.

-If that's all right.
<i>-Suit yourself.</i>

-<i>You ready for tonight?</i>
-Yeah, I'm ready.

-Don't worry about me, Larry.
<i>-Good luck anyway.</i>

Thanks, I guess.

-Okay.
-Go, Zooey.

Hey.

Before I forget.
This is your pass for tonight.

-This is the band you're pitchin'?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's them.

Why don't you try
running your spiel by me?

You know, kick the tires a little bit.

No. No, I'm okay. Thanks though.

Come on. I mean, you're asking
a successful band to leave a major label

and trust you at a boutique.

Let's hear it.

Come on. Just give me your pitch.
It's good practice.

I mean, your career depends on it, right?

Okay.

We're not corporate.

We're not part of a conglomerate
that only worries about the bottom line.

We actually are a company that still
believes the artist is visionary,

not just a product.

Yeah, don't say any of that.
You sound like a pussy.

Never mind. Bad idea.

You were always a little timid,
even as a little kid.

You have any idea how condescending
and insulting you can be?

Just listen to me?
These guys are surrounded

by people tellin' 'em
how great they are all the time.

They need that because they're artists.

We're all just
a bunch of insecure bastards.

So you don't tell them how great they are,

you tell 'em
what you don't like about 'em.

Speak with authority.
Not only will they respect you,

but they'll believe
you're the only guy who can fix it.

-Why'd you come on this trip?
-What?

Don't tell meÂ  it's about
this "Seven Sisters" or whoever.

Spare Sevens. Yeah, no. That's why.

And I guess there's part of me

that figured this was the last chance
I'd have to see you

and how you measure up against
the bastard I've hated all these years.

How am I doing?

You're holding your own.

You wanna know the sad part?

I've actually been trying.

<i>â™ª Say your last hallelujah</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª Fight with the great illusion</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Wake up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come on, take me home â™ª</i>

-What do you think?
-I think they're good.

-What?
-I think they're good.

I think
they could use a new record label though.

I agree.

<i>â™ª Wake up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come on, take me home â™ª</i>

So... what I was talkin' about earlier...

Thanks.

-Sorry. Matt, Matt. What were you saying?
-We're talking about creative control

and support
you're not going to find anywhere else.

I just don't think you should be singin'
for your supper.

We want to give you the space
to record the album

that the whole world is waiting for.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

But, um...

I'm going to do that no matter where I am,
aren't I?

Yes, no, of course,
but what we're offering is...

Matt,
you've worked with some serious bands.

And some shit bands if I'm being honest.

A bit of this, a bit of that.

We're on a streak now.

Selling out shows, heavy rotation.

If it ain't broke, and all that.

-Right?
-Yeah. No. I, um...

I hear what you're saying.

Matt.

But it is broke, Jasper.

You just don't know it yet.

Or my hunch is... that maybe you do.

You did agree to meet with me
tonight, right?

-Yes or no?
-Yes.

Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well done.

So you were honest with me.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

I loved your guys' first record.

It was amazing.

Deserves every bit of recognition
that it got.

I worked out to it. I fucked to it.

It helped me get through my divorce.

Seriously. It's one of those.

It was incredible. Because it had balls.

It was unique. It was original.
It was yours.

Your second album, however, <i>Alibi</i>.

Ironically named, if you ask me,
'cause that thing is anything...

but your first album.

It is at best forgettable.

Teenagers make that music
with a fucking laptop.

They do.

I don't know whose idea it was
to put that dance track on there,

but I bet it wasn't any of you guys,
am I wrong?

You don't look at each other
when you play the new songs.

You just look out straight forward,
scanning the crowd for girls.

-You're embarrassed. I don't blame you.
-What's your point?

I think you're better than that.
That's all I'm saying.

'Cause you're an actual
fucking rock band.

Drums, guitar, bass, vocals.

Then you add all this other shit
you don't need.

You're selling albums, but to who?

People that pay attention
to fuckin' commercials.

I want you guys
to get back to what you do.

To reclaim what made
the Spare Sevens the Spare Sevens.

If you don't, you're just going to
be another casualty of the machine.

If I didn't believe this, if I didn't
believe in you, I wouldn't be here.

You have no fucking idea
what it took me to get here.

Fuck.

Fuck, man.

You've got a massive pair of balls on you,
don't you?

Yeah.

They make my dick look really small.

Okay, man.

Okay.

How do you see this working?

Glad you asked.

-I have to take a look at your contract.
-This geezer pissed himself.

This geezer pissed his pants!

Get the old codger a nappy.
Get him a diaper!

Shit!

Fucking hope not.

Get him out.

I don't even know what happened.

Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

What were you sayin'?

Matt?

Um...

You guys are newly famous, so by default
you're going to be assholes.

What?

The sad thing is there's a big part of me
that would still love to sign you.

But I can't even pretend
to have anywhere...

close to some type of respect
for any of you.

Um...

You know what? Thank you for the beer.

And good luck.

Matt.

I got it.

Here. Keep the change.

You're welcome.

I'll see you guys in a little bit,
all right?

-Where are you goin'?
-Just gonna take a few moments

to collect my thoughts.

By that, I mean I'm gonna
get fucked up across the street.

Well, that was something?
That was stupid.

What? He should have closed the deal.

He was defending you.

Don't put this on me. It wasn't my fault.

-That's not the point.
-I'm standing here in my own piss.

Maybe you could
try to get to the goddamn point.

The point is, you're gonna thank him
tonight, and you're gonna mean it.

Ben. Ben!

I... I can't do this anymore.

I love you, and you know that but...

you don't make it easy.
You make it virtually impossible.

But Matt, he's here for you.
It doesn't matter what he says.

He... He came on this trip for you.

You have done nothing to earn his love,
but tonight he gave it to you anyway.

And he did that for you,
and if you can't find it in yourself

to show your son.
just, like, an ounce of kindness,

then I... I can't...
I'm done defending you.

I can't be your nurse.

I don't know how to help you.

Are you done?

Yeah. Okay.

-What does that mean? "Okay."
-You're fired.

Is someone sitting here?

No. How's he doing?

He's overcome with gratitude.

Really?
No.

Nope. I need a drink.

Hey,

can I please get, like,
any semi-decent reposado on ice, please?

Let me ask you something. You were there.

It was happening, right?
Like before I had my little freak out?

-I had 'em, yeah?
-Yeah. You did.

-So I really screwed myself. Okay.
-That's not how I see it.

I appreciate that, but...

I don't know if you realize
what kind of opportunities are out there

for a guy like me at this point.

Like, a handful?

Zero... is the right answer.

Then, once word of this gets out,
it's gonna be even less.

-The word is officially out.
-And are you fired?

No. Not quite.

Apparently I'm "fried."

Now I'm fired. There we go.
Good.

Don't laugh. At least you got a job.
No. I was actually just fired too.

-You're joking.
-No. I'm not.

-What? Why?
-It's fine. He does it a lot actually.

-So, cheers to that.
-Cheers.

-Cheers.
-Cheers. Here we go.

-Want another one?
-No! God!

If I had any more, I'd get surly.
Yeah? -Yeah.
-I'd pay to see that. Are you sure?

Okay, well, that would be your funeral,
buddy.

What's this?

<i>â™ª The angel opens her eyes</i>â™ª

<i>â™ª Pale blue-colored eyes</i>â™ª

-This is Live.
-What?

You're singing Live right now.
You said you didn't know the band Live.

-This is Live. You're singing it.
-No.

I think you're drunk.
You're hallucinating.

No, I heard you.

<i>- â™ª Now feel it, comin' back again â™ª</i>

Hey.

-What are you doing?
-I'm going to the airport.

-What are you talkin' about?
-Yeah. This was a mistake.

No, it wasn't. Hey, slow down.

I've already called a nurse
to replace me and...

she should probably be here by breakfast.

Hey, Zooey. Come on. What is this?
What's goin' on here?

Hey, come on. You can't just leave.

-What about Ben?
-He fired me last night.

He fires you all the time.

-Yeah. Now I'm takin' him up on it.
-Okay, but why now?

-Why? What is going on?
-I can't do this, okay?

Do what? What are you talking about?

-I'm not going to hurt you.
-You don't know that.

Look. I get it, okay?
Your husband cheated on you.

I'm not him.

Okay, well, he didn't cheat on me.
I cheated on him.

And I couldn't even tell you why.
I went and fucked someone.

So what? So what? You made a mistake.

It was three years ago.
He was the wrong guy.

No. I am the wrong girl.

Zooey, what about, "Nothing good
comes from living in the past."

Yeah, and then you told me
I sounded like your ex-wife.

Ben. Hey.

Hello?

Thanks, man.Â  I appreciate it.
It will just take a second.

He's probably just in here. Hey, Ben?

Shit! Hey! Ben!

Ben! Are you okay?

Sir! Sir! Go get help! Please!

It's okay. You all right?

This is Beta One, come in.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

-Will you get help?
-We have a possible Code Blue in 428.

It's okay.

So I checked in with Ben's oncologist
in New York and shared some blood work.

We can keep him comfortable, but at this
stage of cancer, that's all we can do.

Now we can arrange
for his transfer to hospice,

but I am afraid he will not be
able to travel back to New York.

We're actually on our way to... Kansas.

That's off the table.

Matt, your father is very weak,

and while we can keep him comfortable
here, he really doesn't have much longer.

I'm sorry.

I'll check back in in a little bit.

-Yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Coffee smells good.

Hey.

You want some?

How are you feeling?

I'm dying. That's how I'm feeling.

How long have I been here?

Like a day and a half... about.

Where's Zooey?

-She left.
-Is she gone?

I fired her before. It's the first time
she ever actually left.

Do me a favor. Don't tell her I'm here

She might blame herself.

Of course.

Need help?

-Goes in that little slot there.
-Yeah, I know. I remember.

Stretch it out. Nice and tight.

Line it up so the teeth will bite.

-Click it twice.
-That's right. Yeah.

Yep.

Good job.

I used to feed you.

What?

At night while your mother slept.

Give you the bottle.

We were staying in this crappy
little apartment, Lower East Side.

Then afterwards you'd lie...
you'd just lie there...

with your head on my chest.

You had this...

smell, you know,
the way babies smell.

And I would just...

I'd just hold you.

Feeling you breathe.

I'd make all these promises to you.

Tell you that I'd love you forever,

always keep you safe,

never let you feel alone.

I was just filled with this...

infinite love for you.

I don't know what happened to me,
what broke inside of me.

Maybe I was always broken. I don't know.

But those nights with you, if I could...

get to choose what time of my life
to live in forever, that would be it.

That would be it. And I'm not asking
you to forgive me. I don't deserve....

I just...

I love you.

I do. I really do.

And I'm sorry.

It's okay.

Go to sleep. Okay? You're tired.

Knock, knock.

What do you got there?

Your getaway vehicle.

If we're gonna get that film to Dwayne's,
we gotta drive through the night.

Tomorrow is the last day
they're developing Kodachrome.

Never gonna let you take me out of here.

That's why I'm not gonna ask.

It appears I got this tube in my dick.

-Shit.
-It's all right. I can get it. I got it.

What do you mean you can get it? No.
No, no, no, no. Hey!

You can't pull out your own catheter!
Stop it! Stop it! That's crazy!

God.

Dad! Don't!

Fuck you. GetÂ dressed.

-I got you.
-You did get me. Here.

If you ask me,
they should stop making film every year.

All right, I've got you in a single, king.

No. No, we had... two rooms.
Separate rooms reserved.

-Actually, three, but we only need two.
-I'm sorry. It's been insane.

Just... we don't know
who's coming and who's going.

Right now
all I've got is theÂ one room.

One sec.

-We'll take it.
-Super.

I should have it ready for you
in three or four hours.

-Super...
-Fuck you. That's fucking cra... Okay.

That's great. That's great.

Sorry. Long drive. That's great.

Watch your step.

-Hi.
-Hey.

Um...

Excuse me. I wanted to give these rolls
to Dwayne personally.

I'm sorry.
We stopped taking Kodachrome yesterday.

You what? No. I called to confirm.
We were told Thursday.

I know. I'm sorry. We ran out of dye
sooner than expected.

Come on. Look, we just drove
2,000 miles to get here. I just...

-Where's Dwayne?
-Ben Ryder.

-There he is.
-You made it.

-How you doin'?
-Good to see you.

Your assistant here just told me you're
not processing any more Kodachrome.

-She's fired. You're fired.
-Okay, Dad.

Honey, this is Benjamin Asher Ryder,

one of the world's greatest
living photographers.

How do you do? This is my son, Matt.

-Matt, nice to meet you.
-You too.

Well, Ben, I will process these myself.

I left a little room in the line
on the off chance you made it.

Yeah, I was countin' on it.
I appreciate it.

Can you believe it? The end of an era.

I will have these ready
for you to pick up tomorrow.

-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

We could get food. You hungry?

Yeah, I should put something
in my stomach.

Yeah, same.

I'm sorry. Aren't you Benjamin Ryder?

-That's right.
-I don't believe it.

I should have known you'd be here. I was
talking about you to Steve McCurry.

I figured Steve would be here.

-Ernie Coates from <i>National Geographic.</i>
-Ernie.

You did that piece in Afghanistan,
didn't you? Yeah, that was great.

Wow, you know...

At the risk of embarrassing you, you're
the reason I became a photographer.

Why would that embarrass me?

Marie, come here.

-This is Benjamin Ryder.
-No way.

Yeah, I'm afraid so.

A bunch of us were talking
about your Afghan series.

Can you believe they're stopping it?
You must've been pretty pissed.

No, not really.
A little sentimental, I guess, but...

just a matter of time, you know.

You know. Geez.

We're all so... so frightened by time,

and the way it moves on,
the way things disappear.

That's why we're photographers.

We're preservationists by nature.

We take pictures to stop time,

to commit moments to eternity.

Human nature made tangible.

About as good a definition of art as any,
I guess.

Ben.
Rick Ross. We were in Grenada together.

We were shooting for Reuters.
My God.

-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

Ben,
do you mind if I get a picture with you?

Would it matter if I did? I don't know.

Sure. That's okay.

-Aw, that's great.
-There you go.

-Thank you.
-You all be well now.

-You too, Ben.
-Good to see you.

Do you hear that?

All right.

What should we do this evening?

We could go see what Parsons, Kansas
has in the way of nightlife.

I could actually eat again.

Don't know if they have room service here.
Should we get a pizza?

Go to a restaurant? Order in?

Hello? Any thoughts on the matter?

Okay, Dad.

Okay.

I'm sorry about Ben, Matt.

I've been on the phone
with the medical examiner's office,

tryin' to get the body released.

Should be good to go shortly.

-Thanks, Larry.
-Mr. Ryder.

Dwayne from Dwayne's Photo.

Yes. Hi. I remember you.

This is Larry Holdt.

-Sure.
-Ben's manager.

I was...
very saddened to hear about your father.

I wanted to deliver these personally.

I know he was very protective of his work.

Thank you. Yeah.
My dad would have appreciated it.

Outside a roll I shot myself,

these are the last rolls
of Kodachrome film ever to be developed.

I think he would have liked the symmetry.

Yeah.

Take care.

You too, Dwayne.

Here you go.
No.

Ben was very direct about it.

He said you'd curate the show.

I don't know anything about photography.
Why would he do that?

I learned a long time ago
never to ask why where Ben was concerned.

Hold on.

Larry Holdt.

<i>I don't know. I've just been realizing</i>

<i>I've given up on so much stuff in my life.</i>

<i>Playin' music and...</i>

my marriage.

Ben.

I'm tired of doing it. I don't want to
do it anymore, and I'm not gonna. And...

Well, I want you to be...

I'd love for you to be
one of the things I don't give up on.

<i>All right, I'll hang up now.</i>

<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

Let's see what all the buzz is about, Ben.

Hey. Hey.

Hey.

How'd you know I'd be here?

Larry.

Yeah.

I guess the guy really does
know everything?

Yeah.

Are they all like that?

Yeah.

Do you want company?

Yeah.
