(SONG FADES)

Colm?

Are you coming out
to the pub, Colm?

It's 2:00, like.

(CLOCK CHIMES TWICE)

Will I see you down there, so?

I'll see you down there, so.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

What are you doin' home?

Brother?

What are you doin' home?

I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.
He's just sitting there.

Sitting there doin' what?

Sittin' there doin' nothing.

Smoking.

Was he asleep?

He was smoking, Siobhan.

How do you smoke
in your sleep, like?

Have ye been rowing?

We haven't been rowin'.

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Have we been rowin'?

Why wouldn't he
answer the door to me?

Maybe he just
doesn't like you no more.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

Pint, Jonjo.

Is Colm not with you?

No.
Colm's always with you.

I know.
Did you not knock for him?

I did knock for him.

Well, where is he?
Just sittin' there.

Sittin' there doin' what?

Sittin' there doing nothin'.

Smokin'.

Have ye been rowin'?

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

It does sound
like we've been rowin'.

Will I try him again?

That'd be the best thing.

Officer Kearney.

Never says "hello."

Never fecking says "hello."

(OPERATIC GOSPEL MUSIC
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

Colm?

(OPERATIC GOSPEL MUSIC
CONTINUES PLAYING)

Colm?

The door was open, Colm.

Colm?

Where the hell
are you headin' off to?

MAN: Everybody?
JONJO: No, this is true.

He scored six points
from open play.

(MEN LAUGH
AND TALK INDISTINCTLY)

He was barely
the size of a dwarf!

This is true!

(MEN LAUGH
AND TALK INDISTINCTLY)

Howdo.
MAN: Howdo, Padraic.

Sit somewhere else.

Huh?

Uh... But I have
me pint there, Colm.

He has his pint there, Colm,

from when he came in
and ordered his pint before.

Okay.

I'll sit somewhere else, so.

MAN: Are ye rowin'?

I didn't think we were rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside

on his own
like a whatchamacallit.

It does look like we're rowin'.

Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.

See what all this
is fecking about.

MAN: That'd be the best thing.

Now I'm sittin' here
next to you,

and if you're goin' back
inside, I'm followin' you inside,

and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.

Now, if I've done somethin'
to ya,

just tell me
what I've done to ya.

And if I've said
somethin' to ya,

maybe I said somethin' when I
was drunk, and I've forgotten it,

but I don't think I said somethin'
when I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

But if I did,
then tell me what it was,

and I'll say sorry
for that too, Colm.

I'll say sorry.

Just stop running away from me
like some fool of a moody schoolchild.

But you didn't
say anything to me.

And you didn't
do anything to me.

That's what
I was thinking, like.

I just don't like you no more.

You do like me.

I don't.

But you liked me yesterday.

Oh, did I, yeah?

I thought you did.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS)

Padraic.

Dominic.

What's the matter with ya?

There's nothing the matter
with me, for God's sake.

DOMINIC: Look at this I found.

A stick with a hook.

What would you use it for,
I wonder?

To hook things that were
the length of a stick away?

Where you goin'?

PADRAIC: Down here.

DOMINIC: As good a plan
as any!

Have you any fags?
No.

Uh, you do.
You always have fags.

ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's
handing out a rake of fags.

Whoever's in the mood for one.

Is he?
No!

(MUTTERS UNINTELLIGIBLY)

You're behavin' awful unusual.

(DOOR CLOSES)

What are you doin' here?

Was the pub closed?

No, it was open.

Anything in the paper?

Just the Civil War still.
Ugh.

A bad do.

Mrs. McCormick's comin' over
later, Padraic. I couldn't avoid her.

I don't know if you're gonna be
in or out, but you're usually out.

Am I?

You are.
Yeah, you know you are.

I don't care, Siobhan.

This is your house, too.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(BIRDS SQUAWK)

Is it six years since your
mammy and daddy died, Siobhan,

or is it seven years
since they died?

It's coming up to eight years,
Mrs. McCormick, aye.

Is it comin' up to eight years?

Doesn't time be flyin'?

Aye, when you're havin' fun.

Oh, be off
to the pub now, Padraic,

if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

I don't have to be down there
every night, do I?


ColmSonnyLarry's
scared him off, I suppose.

What did you hear
of ColmSonnyLarry?

Didn't you and he used to be
the best of friends?

We're still the best of friends.

MRS. McCORMICK: No,
you're not. Who says we're not?

She says.

Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.

I said nothing of the like, Mrs.
McCormick! I was just chatting.

Now, you go off
to Jonjo's, Padraic,

and don't be getting
under our feet.

Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets
a chance to come over for a chat.

She never gets a chance
'cause you avoid her.

I do not avoid her!

You hide behind walls
if she's coming up the road.

(DOOR OPENS)
I do not!

H... hide behind walls.

(DOOR SHUTS)
(SIOBHAN SIGHS)

(CANNON AND RIFLE
FIRE IN DISTANCE)

Good luck to ye.

Whatever it is
you're fightin' about.

(FOLK BAND
PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC)

I didn't hear
there was to be a session.

Last-minute thing.

Colm decided.

All the ladies love Colm,
you know. Always did.

Yeah? That's not true.

(DOOR OPENS)

You're still barred,
Dominic! Out!

You said barred until April.

What are we now?

April.

Well, put that stick
outside anyways,

and don't be
bothering the women.

There's women?

There is women.

And good ones.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(MIDTEMPO BANJO MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>â™ª Well, I took out my dog</i>

<i>â™ª And him I did shoot</i>

<i>â™ª All down
in the County Kildare...</i>

If we sat next to Colm, the
women would have to talk to us too,

and then we could get at them
with our small talk.

I'm happy enough
sittin' here, now.

Are ya, yeah?

Are ya happy enough, yeah?

<i>â™ª So fill up your glasses</i>

<i>â™ª With brandy...</i>
(DOMINIC GROANS)

I can't stand the maudlin ones.

Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

To dance to.

And not have that mope whining.

(RESUMES PLAYING SAME SONG)

<i>â™ª So be easy and free... â™ª</i>

Here, amn't I in enough trouble
with him without your mouthing?

What trouble in
are you in with him?

Uh, he just...

doesn't want to be friends
with me no more.

What is he, 12?

(ALL SINGING ALONG)

Why does he not want to
be friends with you no more?

(SONG ENDS)


(DOOR CREAKING)

Shh.

wake him when he's been wanking.

(FLOOR CREAKING SOFTLY)

You won't get into trouble
for taking his poteen?

I will get into trouble,

but fuck it.

I saw cannon-fire and
rifle-fire on the mainland tonight.

Did you see it?

That'll be the Civil War.

I know that, sure.

Me, I pay no attention
to wars. I'm agin 'em.

Wars and soap.

I tell you this much.

We're good at chatting,
aren't we?

Me and you?

Your sister,
does she like to chat?

Not as much as most women,
but she'll chat, like.

She more likes reading.

Reading?

Feckin' hell.

Reading.

And did you ever see her
with no clothes on?

I didn't.

Did you not,
and you her brother?

Not even as a child?

I don't like to be chattin' about
these types of things, Dominic!

What types of things?

Sisters with no clothes on!

You saw my daddy
with no clothes on.

And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.

Sure, don't I know it.

The tiny, brown cock on him.

(PADRAIC SIGHS)

What's the matter with him?

Maybe bad news he's had?

Daddy?

No, ColmSonnyLarry.

Didn't I tell ya
I'd be off if you went

whining about that lummox
one more time?

I tell ya, it didn't look like
he had bad news tonight.

It looked like a weight was
lifted from his shoulders tonight.

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

(COWBELL JINGLING)

Just bringing me cows past.

What?

I was just bringing
me cows past.

I wasn't, you know, trying to...

You don't usually
bring them this way.

I don't,
but then the little fella

took a fright
at a hen on the corner, so...

I only...


I only just saw what month
we changed to yesterday.

More fool me?

Changed to April.

So, will I be callin' for ya
on me way to the pub later?

I will so.

Anyways,

I better chase after these goons

for they're gettin' away
from me.

Maybe they don't
like me no more neither.

See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

Why don't you come down
for a sherry later?

There's no need to be
stuck inside on a nice day.

I will so.

How's the book?

It's sad.

Sad?

Well, you should read
a not sad one, Siobhan,

else you might get sad.

SIOBHAN: Hmm.

Do you never
get lonely, Padraic?

Never get what?


Do I never get lonely?

What's the matter
with everybody?

Jesus.

"Lonely." Fecking hell.

(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING
ON SPEAKERS)

Colm?

(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)


PADRAIC: Pint, Jonjo.


Grand, I think.
With me, anyways.

What are you doing?

Oh, so you're gonna be
an eejit again today, is it?

Amn't I allowed to have a
quiet pint on me own, Padraic?

Well, don't ask a man to call up
to ya at your fecking house, so,

like he has nothing better
to do with his fecking time.

I didn't ask you to call up
to me at me house.

And you do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

Huh?

You do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

I know I've nothing better
to do with me fecking time,

but there's better things I could
be doing with me fecking time

than to be calling up to ya
at your house, Colm Doherty!

Like what?

Huh?

Like what else
could you be doin'?

Reading.

Reading, yeah?

Me, this morning...

this I wrote.

(PLAYING MELODIOUS TUNE)

Tomorrow, I'll write
the second part of it.

And the day after, I'll write
the third part of it.

And by Wednesday, there'll
be a new tune in the world,

which wouldn't have been there
if I'd spent the week

listening to your bollocks,
Padraic Suilleabhain.

So, do you want
to take your pint outside,

or do you want me
to take my pint outside?

I'll take my pint outside,

'cause it's a shite tune
anyways,

I wouldn't bother with it.

(EXHALES SHAKILY)

I was too harsh yesterday.

Yesterday, he says.

I know well
you was too harsh yesterday.

And today.

I just, uh...

I just have this tremendous sense
of time slippin' away on me, Padraic.

And I think I need to spend
the time I have left

thinking and composing.

Just trying not to listen

to any more of the dull things
that you have to say for yourself.

But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.

Are you dying?

No, I'm not dying.

But then you've loads of time.

For chatting?

Aye.
For aimless chatting?

Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.

So, we'll keep
aimlessly chatting

and me life'll keep dwindling.

And in 12 years, I'll die
with nothin' to show for it

bar the chats I've had
with a limited man, is that it?

I said,
"Not aimless chatting."

I said,
"Good, normal chatting."

The other night, two hours
you spent talking to me

about the things you found in
your little donkey's shite that day.

Two hours, Padraic.
I timed it.

Well, it wasn't me
little donkey's shite, was it?

It was me pony's shite, which
shows how much you were listenin'.

None of it helps me,
do you understand?

None of it helps me.

We'll just chat
about somethin' else then.


What's the matter with ya?

Nothin'.

Aren't we going for a sherry?

Don't feel like it.

No, I'm not having this
again today!

Hey! What the hell's going on
with you and me fecking brother?

Don't come in here
shouting the odds at me

in the middle of the fecking
day, all right, Siobhan?

You can't just all of a sudden

stop being friends with a fella!

Why can't I?

Why can't ya?
Because it isn't nice.

Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?

No!
Righty-ho.

Has he said somethin' to ya
when he was drunk?

No, I prefer him
when he's drunk.

It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.

What's the fecking matter, then?

He's dull, Siobhan.

He's what?

He's dull.

But he's always been dull.
What's changed?

I've changed.

I just don't have a place for
dullness in me life anymore.

But you live on an island
off the coast of Ireland, Colm.

What the hell
are you hoping for, like?

For a bit of peace, Siobhan.
That's all.

For a bit of peace
in me heart, like.

You can understand that.
Can't ya?

Can't ya?

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

Do you think I'm dull?

No. 'Cause you're not dull,
you're nice.

That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.

Or I was.

Till me best friend started
acting the gilly-gooly.

It's him, Padraic.

Maybe he's just depressed.

was thinking, that he's depressed.


he could at least
keep it to himself, like.

You know, push it down,
like the rest of us.

(COWBELL JINGLES)

No, Jenny!
(SNAPS FINGERS) Out!

(COWBELL JINGLES)
Out!

She just wants
a bit of company, Siobhan.

Animals is for outside,
I've told ya.

(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

And people don't be laughing
at me behind me back,

do they?

No. Why would they be?

They don't think
I'm dim or anything?

Dim?

No.

You don't seem
very sure about it.

Of course, I'm sure about it.

Dominic's the dim one
on the island, isn't he?

He is, aye. By miles.

Uh, hang on, by miles.

And then,
who's the next dimmest?

Well, I don't like
to judge people

in those terms now, do I?

In what terms?
In order of their dimness.

Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?

But try, like.
No!

I won't try.

There's enough judgy people
on this fecking island, so no!

You're not dim!

You're a nice man, all right?
So, move on!

I'm as clever as you, anyways.

I know that at least.

(UNDER BREATH) Yeah,
don't be fecking stupid.

Huh?

(BELL TOLLING)
(PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(PEACEFUL MUSIC
CONTINUES PLAYING)

What happened to you?

Me daddy discovered
the poteen situation.

SIOBHAN: Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

You poor thing, ya.

What the hell
was he hittin' you with?

A kettle was the final thing.

I wouldn'ta minded,
but for the spout.

Do you want a ride to church?

Uh, feck them gobshites!

Dominic!

But could I stay the night
with ye the night?

Just for the one night, like?

SIOBHAN: Mm...

Well, just the one night, mind.

Nice! I'll see ye
for supper, so.


(PRAYING IN LATIN)

(GLOOMY MUSIC PLAYING)

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

It's eight weeks since
my last confession, I think.

Go on, Colm.

I suppose, Father.

The drinking
and the impure thoughts.

And a bit of pride, I suppose.

Although I never really saw that
as a sin, but sure I'm here now.

And

how's the despair?

Not so much of it of late.
Thanks be.

And why aren't you talking to
Padraic Suilleabhain no more?

That wouldn't be a sin, now,
would it, Father?

It wouldn't be a sin, no, but
it's not very nice either, is it?

Who told you?

It's an island, Colm.
Word gets around.

Also, Padraic asked me
to put in a word, like.

I see.

So...

It isn't him you have the
impure thoughts about, is it?

Are you joking me?

I mean,
are you fecking joking me?

People do have impure thoughts
about men, too.

Do you have impure thoughts
about men, Father?

I do not have
impure thoughts about men.

And how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth?

Well, you started it.

Well, you can get out of my
confessional right now, so you can.

And I'm not forgiving you
any of these things

until the next time, so I'm not!

Well, I better not be dying in
the meantime then, eh, Father?

I'll be pure fucked!

You will be pure fucked!

Yes, you will be pure fucked!

Pint, Colm?

If you don't stop talkin' to me,

and if you don't
stop botherin' me,

or sendin' your sister
or your priest to bother me...

I didn't send me sister
to bother you, did I?

She has her own mind.

Although, I did send the priest
though, you have me there.

What I've decided to do is this.

I have a set of shears at home.

And each time you bother me
from this day on,

I'll take those shears

and I'll take one
of me fingers off with them.

And I'll give that finger to ya.

A finger from me left hand.
Me fiddle hand.

And each day you bother me more,

another I'll take off
and I'll give ya

until you see
sense enough to stop.

Or until I have no fingers left.

Does this make things
clearer to ya?

Not really, no.

Because I don't want

to hurt your feelings, Padraic.

I don't, like.

But it feels like the drastic

is the only option
left open to me.

You've loads of options
left open to ya.

How's fingers
the first port of call?

Please, don't talk to me

no more, Padraic. Please.

I'm begging you.

But...
JONJO: Shush, like, Padraic.

Just, you know, shush, like.
Yeah, I'd shush, like.

I will shush.

Except me and me sister
were thinking

a bit depressed, Colm.

And I tell you this much,
fingers just confirms it.

Don't you think, Colm?

Starting from now.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Well, I never heard the like.

I never heard the like. He
must really not like you, Padraic.

Fingers!

Jesus. He's serious, lads.

JONJO: He is serious!

You can see it
in his eyes he's serious.

Just because
he thinks you're dull.

That's going overboard!

Who told you about the dull?

Well, I overheard it.

Like, what was I supposed to do?

I don't think you're dull.

And jeez, if I was
to cut something off meself

for every dull person that came
in here, I'd only have me head left.

Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

No.

That said,

I did think the two of ye always
made a funny pairing, like.

No, we didn't.
JONJO: Yeah, ye did.

Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

'Cause now he'd rather
maim himself than talk to ya.

Colm was always
more of a thinker.

Huh?

Why's every... I think.

Ah, you don't, Padraic.

You don't, Padraic.
Your sister does.

Your sister does, aye.
Siobhan does. You're more of a...

You're more of a...
What is he?

You're more one
of life's good guys.

You're more one
of life's good guys, aye.

Apart from when you're drunk.

Apart from when
you're drunk, aye.

I used to think
that'd be a nice thing to be.

One of life's good guys.

And now, it sounds like
the worst thing I ever heard.

Ah, don't take it
like that, Padraic.

Don't take it
like that, Padraic.

We're on your side.

(GLOOMY MUSIC PLAYING)

What are you smiling at?

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

What's this mope so mopey for?
He's just a fecking man, lads!

A fat, ginger man!

Ay yi yi.

I'll tell ya this much.
Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

Luckily, you won't have to put
up with us more than one night, so,

and try eatin'
with your mouth closed.

Where are we now, France?

Will you tell him, Padraic?

Aye, stop being a little
fecking bollocks, Dominic.

No. Just about
the mouth thing.

Colm Doherty
and his fat fecking fingers.

He probably
wouldn't even be able

to cut through the blubber
on them fingers.

Would you not want him
to have to do the one finger

to see if he was bluffing, like?

No, we wouldn't.

That's what I'd have him do,

I'd have him do the one finger
to see if he was bluffin'.

'Cause worst comes to worst,

he can still play the fiddle
with four fingers, I'll bet ya.

Or the banjo.

We don't want any of that.

We just want nothing
to do with him no more.

You don't. This gom does.

I am a gom, is right.

You're not a gom!
(DOMINIC SIGHS)

DOMINIC: Jeez.

This is a depressing house.

Would you prefer your own, so?

I've heard it's a barrel
of fecking laughs.

Well, touche.

Too what?

Che. Touche.
It's from the French.

And how is it, Siobhan,
that you was never married?

It's none of your
fecking business

how I was never fecking married.

How isn't it?

How isn't it?

Was you never wild?

Wild? Was I never wild?

I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Dominic.

Wild, how? Angry?

'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,
I can tell ya!

Not angry. Wild.

You just keep
sayin' wild, Dominic!

Wild! My brother
told you, didn't he?

That you'd be out in the road

if you started
talking stupid to me?

He said creepy, not stupid.

Well, you've failed
on both counts, haven't ya?

I have.

I'm off to bed and he's not
stayin' here another night, Padraic.

I don't care
how depressed you are.

I'd rather have the donkey in.

(DOOR SHUTS)

Foiled again.

But "faint heart" and all that.

Here.

Ye two, ye'll be all right.

Will we be?

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

(CLICKING TONGUE)

Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I've the milk outside for ya.

So, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, I think.

Nobody has a lick of news

for us from your side
of the island, Padraic.

Are you going
to be the same as them?

I am, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I'm afraid.

And I'm in a bit
of a rush, so...

Eileen Coughlan had no news.

Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

It was a poor old week for
news. But then it is, sometimes.

ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

Did he not?

That man never talks.

Eh, he talks sometimes.
Up himself.

Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two
weeks you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

As I was sayin'.

(REGISTER DINGS)

Ladies.

Oh, it's Peadar.

Peadar always
has a rake of news.

What news have you, Peadar?
PEADAR: News, is it?

Fella killed himself,
over Rosmuck way.

Walked into a lake for himself.

Twenty-nine and nothing wrong
with him, the fool.

God love us!

PEADAR: No,
not "God love us." Fool!

Another fella,

Protestant, of course,

stabbed his missus
in Letterkenny.

Six times he stabbed her.

Good God!
And did she die, Peadar?

She did die, aye.

It wasn't with a spoon
he was stabbin' her.

That's a lot of news.

This man has no news,
don't ya not? No-Newsy!

(PEADAR LAUGHS)

Stukes never have news.
MRS. O'RIORDAN: Stukes!


There was a bit of news
I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

Dominic Kearney's father
beat Dominic senseless

with a kettle Saturday,

and is staying with me
and me sister, Dominic is.

So, at least his father'll
take a bit of a break

from his beatin' of him.

And him, a policeman.

Isn't that news?

Ar, that Dominic's
an awful little bollocks.

That's no news.

Still, he was in a bad way
when I came upon him.

I'd beat him with a kettle
meself if I wasn't old.

It's news is all I'm sayin'.

That's no news.
That's shite news.

Oh, hello there, Colm.

Will I see you at Jonjo's

I owe you no pin...

You will, Peadar.

Good man yourself.

What's that, Jenny?

Will we go to the pub
for ourselves?

We will. Come on.

One drink you're havin', lady,
then it's off home with ya.

I've a shirt that
wants ironing for the morning.

Okay, Daddy.

Aye. Off to the mainland
in the morning I'm headin'.

That's why I need
the clean shirt, like.

"And why are you off to the
mainland in the mornin', Peadar?"

Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.
I'll tell ya why.

They've asked for extra manpower

for a couple of the

any kind of a to-do, like.

Six bob and a free lunch
they're payin' me.

And sure I'd have gone
for nothin'.

I've always wanted to see
an execution, haven't you?

Although, I'd have
preferred a hanging.

Who are they executin'?

The Free State lads are
executin' a couple of the IRA lads.

Or is it the other way around?


I find it hard
to follow these days.

Wasn't it so much easier when
we was all on the same side,

and it was just the English
we was killin'?

I think it was.
I preferred it.

But you don't care
who's executin' who?

For six bob and a free lunch,
I don't care!

They could be
executin' you. (CHUCKLES)

Why don't you come with me?

You could write a miserable
feckin' song about it.

Nah, I'm only messin'.

(MUFFLED FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)

Who are them?

Music students, I think,
from Lisdoonvarna.

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Another whiskey, anyways, Jonjo.

Jeez, you're goin' at it at a
fair old lick tonight, Padraic.

Yeah? What's it to ya?

(DRUM INTRO PLAYS)

Padraic, don't now...

Go get Siobhan,
Dominic, would ya?

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

PEADAR: What are you
after, gobshite?

Another beatin', is it?

You, copper, I'm allowed
to chat to you, aren't I?

It's just tubbyguts
I'm not allowed to talk to.

Actually, no, I'd rather
you didn't talk to me neither.

Oh, well, anyways,

do you want to know what the
three things that I hate the most

on Inisherin is?
Not really.

One,

policemen.

Two,

pudgy fiddle players.

And three... (VOICE CRACKS)

Wait, I had some funny thing
for three. What was it?

Uh, I'll start again. One, um,

policemen.

Two...

Pudgy fiddle players.

PADRAIC: Pudgy fiddle players.

And shite, what was three?

Go on back to your own gang
now, Padraic. I'm serious, now.


(MUSIC HALTS)

And talkin' to me, are ya?

DOMINIC: Siobhan!

Padraic's out of his brains
on whiskey, and Colm's there.

You'd better come.

You, Colm Doherty, do you
know what you used to be?

No, Padraic,
what did I used to be?

Nice!

You used to be nice!

Didn't he not?

And now,
do you know what you are?

Not nice.

Ah, well,

I suppose niceness doesn't
last then, does it, Padraic?

But will I tell ya something
that does last?

What? And don't say
somethin' stupid like music.

Music lasts.
Knew it!

And paintings last.
And poetry lasts.

So does niceness.
(DOOR OPENS)

COLM: Do you know
who we remember

for how nice they was
in the 17th century?

PADRAIC: Who?
Absolutely no one.

Yet we all remember
the music of the time.

Everyone, to a man,
knows Mozart's name.

Well, I don't,
so there goes that theory.

And anyway,
we're talkin' about niceness.

Not whatsisname.

My mammy, she was nice.

I remember her.

And my daddy, he was nice.
I remember him.

And my sister, she's nice.

I'll remember her.
Forever I'll remember her.

COLM: And who else will?
PADRAIC: "Who else will" what?

Remember Siobhan
and your niceness?

No one will.

In 50 years' time,

no one will remember any of us.

Yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago...

"Yet," he says,
like he's English.

Come home, Padraic.

I don't give a feck
about Mozart,

or Borvoven,

or any of them
funny name feckers.

I'm Padraic Suilleabhain.

And I'm nice.

SIOBHAN: (WHISPERS) Come home.

So you'd rather be friends
with this fella, would ya?

A fella who

beats his own son
black and blue every night

that he's not fiddling with him.

I never told him that, Daddy.
He's... He's just drunk now.

You used to be nice.

Or did you never used to be?

Oh, God.

Maybe you never used to be.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

I'll have a word with him, Colm.

You don't need
to do anything drastic.

He won't be
botherin' you no more.

That's a shame.

That's the most interesting
he's ever been.

I think I like him again now.

Aye, in the heat, I suppose.


A job offer, is it?

A job offer from a library

Just the rashers, please, Mrs.
O'Riordan. About ten of them.

You never tell me anything!

Well, it'd crucify him,
your leaving!

Hey, no one's leaving!

Listen, I didn't
come down to chat.

I just came down to say
that all that last night

was just
the whiskey talkin', Colm.

All what last night?

All whatever it was
I was sayin'.

What were you sayin'?

Uh... Yeah.
I can't remember much of it,

but I remember the gist
of it wasn't the best.

You always know, don't ya?

Well, anyways, I just wanted
to say I was sorry.

Will we leave it at that?

Why can't you just
leave me alone, Padraic?

PADRAIC: Huh?

I've already told ya, haven't I?

Yeah, I know. I was just...

I mean, why can't you

What are ya doing?
I don't know.

For fuck's sake, like.

How... How's the new tune?

What?

Ar, for God's sake, Padraic.

How many more times?

I am not putting me donkey
outside when I am sad, okay?

Well, stringy bits of shite
I had to pick up

yesterday when ya let her in!

There was no stringy bits
in that donkey's shite.

There was bits of straw,

Maybe it was straw, so.

Was I awful last night?

No, you was lovely.

Well, I know I wasn't lovely

I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

No, I'm not feckin' stupid.
We've had this discussion.

You've got to leave him

Do you think?

Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

He's cut his feckin' finger
off, and thrown it at ya!

Come on! It wasn't at me.

Well, what are we going to do?

We can't keep a man's finger.

I won't, Colm. I only came up
to give you your finger back.

Oh, yeah?

Thanks.

Cleared up quite nice, actually.

And you wouldn't
have thought it would.

What do you need from him, Colm?

To end all this?

Silence, Siobhan.

Just silence.

One more silent man
on Inisherin, good-oh!

Silence it is, so.

This isn't about Inisherin.

It's about one boring man

You're all fecking boring!

I'll see he doesn't talk

It's about your daddy.

Yeah.

They said you'd best hurry home

"beat me up a bit," kill me?

"Beat you up a bit," kill ya,
I think.

Although he did kill a man once.

I'm sorry for that spilling
the beans on ya, Dominic.

I was out of order that night.

You was funny
apart from that bit.

That's why I don't understand why
that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

He seemed fine
when you were slagging him.

He did not.

Did he?

"That's the most interesting
Padraic's ever been," he said.

"I think I like him
again now."

Aye.

Maybe this whole thing has just
been about gettin' you to try a new tack,

start standin' up
for yourself a bit.

Do you think?

Yeah, and be less of a,
you know,

whiny little dull-arse.

Well, I have been less of a
whiny little dull-arse, actually.

Have ya, yeah?

Just yesterday,
there was this musician fella

that Colm was
getting along great with.

And what did I do?

I went and sent him
packing from the island.

Did ya? How?

I told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy,

and he'd have to be rushing
home to him, lest he die.

Oh...

That sounds like the
meanest thing I've ever heard.

Huh?

Well, aye,
it was a bit mean, but...

he'll be fine once he gets home

and he finds his daddy
hasn't been hit by a bread van.

I used to think
you were the nicest of them.

Turns out you're just

Calling old people
ghouls and that.

isn't it?

I'm glad I caught you, actually.

Because there was somethin' I

And discovering how much
we have in common,

well, it just makes me

We don't have

Uh, don't skip ahead.

But yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

Somethin' along the lines of...

Should've planned this, really.

Well, yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

You probably wouldn't
ever want to, I don't know,

to fall in love with a boy
like me, would ya?

Oh, Dominic,
I don't think so, love.

No, yeah, no.
Uh, I was thinking no.

Not even in the future, like?
Like when I'm your age?

Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

Just thought I'd ask
on the off chance, you know,

like, "faint heart" and that.

Have I gone fecking mental?

No, I haven't gone

Not only have I not gone

but I have ten fingers to prove
I've not gone fecking mental.

How many fingers do you have to
prove you've not gone fecking mental?

Nine fingers.

And nine fingers

Haven't finished yet, have I?

Well, I finished with your door.

I haven't finished

I'd dance with me donkey
if I knew how. And she did.

Is it good?

Mm, what's it called?

But there are no banshees
on Inisherin.

I know, I just like

Aye.

There's plenty
of double S-H on Inisherin.

Yeah.

Maybe there are banshees, too.

I just don't think that they
scream to portend death anymore.

I think they just
sit back, amused, and observe.

Yeah.

I keep having thoughts about

PADRAIC: <i>Dear Siobhan.</i>

<i>Obviously, I don't know
what "ensconced" is,</i>

<i>but I thank you for the offer of
the free bed and the whatnot.</i>

<i>But I won't be takin' you up
on it, I'm afraid.</i>

<i>As I told you,
me life is on Inisherin.</i>

<i>Me friends, me animals.</i>

<i>Even now as I write,</i>

<i>little donkey Jenny
is looking at me, saying,</i>

<i>"Please don't go, Padraic.
We'd miss ya."</i>

<i>And nuzzling me,
the gilly-gooly.</i>

<i>Get off, Jenny.</i>

MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

PADRAIC: <i>In other news,</i>

<i>in sadder news, actually,</i>

<i>I won't be able to ask Dominic
anything, I'm afraid.</i>

<i>Because they found him
in the lake this morning.</i>

<i>I suppose he must've slipped
and fell in.</i>

<i>So, there'd be no one to take
care of the animals, anyway.</i>

(GLASS SMASHING)

<i>No other news, really.</i>

<i>Except that I love you, Siobhan.</i>

<i>And I miss ya.</i>

<i>And I hope I'll see ya
again someday.</i>

<i>If you ever come back home.</i>

Come back home, Siobhan.

<i>Yours sincerely,
your loving brother...</i>

<i>Padraic Suilleabhain.</i>

Suppose me house makes us quits.

If you'd stayed in your house,
that would've made us quits.

But you didn't, did ya,
so it doesn't, does it?

I'm sorry
about your donkey, Padraic.

Honestly, I am.

I don't fucking care.

Haven't heard any rifle fire
from the mainland in a day or two.

I think they're coming
to the end of it.

I'm sure they'll be at it again
soon enough, aren't you?

Some things
there's no movin' on from.

And I think that's a good thing.

Padraic.

Thanks for lookin' after
me dog for me, anyways.

Any time.
