I've lived in the
theatre since I was a kid.

what I don't know about acting

isn't worth knowing.

now, you may be 20 years
old and just beginning,

but I think you're a genius.

you've got magnetism,
but no idea how to use it.

you have to grab the audience
by the throat and say:

"now, you buggers, you
pay attention to me!"

and remember this,

when you're on the stage acting,

theatre is the only reality.

everything else, the world outside,

what civilians call the real world,

is nothing but fantasy.

and I bloody well
won't let you forget it.

the trouble is, darling,
I'm an incurable romantic.

I believe in love,

I believe in happiness,

I believe in us.

you're just saying that.

there's someone else, isn't there?

I love you, I do.

I do, I
love you--

and I used to believe

we'd live happily ever after.

didn't you?

with every fiber of my being.

only now...

[audience applauding]

[car honking]

[clock bell tolls]

[door squeaking]

good morning, miss Lambert.

good morning, Margery,

is anyone with my lord and master?


darling, what are you doing here?

I want an answer, Michael.

what's the question?

what did I say to you

before we went to sleep last night, hmm?

uh, I give up. what did you say to me

before we went to sleep last night?

I said I was tired.

it seems a perfectly natural thing
to say before you go to sleep.

Christ, Michael, you can be
an irritating little shit!

Julia, Julia, really,

if your public could
only hear your language.

I want them to hear.

I want every bloody one of them to hear.

I'm tired. I am utterly exhausted.

I need a holiday.

just admit it, Michael.

you've never understood what it means

to carry a play,

to sweat it out night after night.

I'm the only one who takes it
seriously, Michael, you know that.

all you do is count the money and
think it's a bloody great lark.

take the play off.

but we'll lose a fortune.

our partner won't like it.

to hell with dolly!


I'm sorry, sweetheart.

god, I didn't mean to be so vile.

it's just I'm-- I'm
near to breaking point.

everything's so tedious.


I want something to happen.

what?

I wish I knew.

please. please close the
play at the end of the month.


yeah. I really do
have to think about it.

we can't have the theatre dark.

hmm?

I'll try and see what
I can do. I promise.

hmm?

please.

I promise.

thank you.

you were very quiet

leaving the house this morning.

well, I didn't want to wake you.

you were dead to the world.

hmm. I did my exercises
and went for a run.

exercises, running...

god, Michael,

you're the vainest man in London.

me, vain? nonsense.


I just want to preserve my magnificent
good looks for as long as possible.


oh, yes, speaking of good looks,

did you notice that
young man as you came in?

no.

he's an American.

son of a friend of a
friend of Eddie Gilbert's.

I can't see what that's
got to do with me.

he admires you tremendously.

oh, he sounds frightfully intelligent.

what's his name?

can't remember.

uh, unfortunately,

he's as poor as a church mouse.

I thought we might give
him a spot of lunch.

well, he's awfully
good-mannered, for an American.


rubbish mail, Margery.

yes, Mr. Gosselyn.

uh, I would like to
introduce you to my wife,

Julia Lambert.

Julia, this
is-- this is--

this is the young man
I was telling you about.

he wants to learn the business,

so we're starting him
off with our accountant.

it-it's an honor to
meet you, miss Lambert.

I wonder if we could persuade you

to come and eat a chop with us.

Michael will drive you back after lunch.

gee, that's real kind of you.

you two take the lift,
I'll take the stairs.

last one down's a sissy.

miss Lambert,

could I-- could
I ask you a favor?

I can't give you any more
room, if that's what you mean.

no, no, no, it's, uh... I wonder...

would you...

would you let me have a photograph?

of course.

gee, that's swell of you.

I've seen you in
farewell, my love 3 times.

you haven't. have you really?

it's such a silly play.

oh, it's not the play,

it's you. you're just... just great.

I'm glad you liked me.

liked you? I loved you.

[elevator thudding]

[door squeaking]

I won. (Julia) what?

well done.

come on, Mr... uh...

all an actress like Julia needs

is a vehicle.

it's the actors the public go to see,

not the play.

that's true in my case. I'd see
you in anything, miss Lambert.

but you know what I'd
really like to find out?

how did you start?

how did you get to be where you are,

owning a theatre, top of the tree?

clean living and hard work. cigarette?

we owe it all to a rude, foul-mouthed
brute called Jimmie Langton.

we were in his repertory
company in Middlesbrough.

he knew all there is to know
about theatre and acting.

that's where I met Michael.
that's how we began.

I was a rotten actor.

yes, but you have presence.

the audience always
gasps when you come on.

it's his dazzling good looks, you see.

gee, this is fascinating. fascinating.

dreadfully jealous of him?

you're very sweet, but
I know perfectly well

that all I can play are
diplomats, lawyers and politicians.

I'm more interested in
the business side. that's--

yes, but you know as well as I do

that we'd be nothing without Jimmie.

I always lay a place
for him at the table.

just in case he turns up.

he's been dead for 15 years.

yes, but you never know.

he was a monster.

uh, how do you spell your first name?

t-o-m.


[nib squeaking]

[gramophone playing]

[people clapping]

[car honking]


hoy!

hoy!

hoy!

hoy!


don't torture yourself like this, Laura.

[Julia sobbing]

no one will ever know
how much I loved him.

he was my earth, my moon,

all the stars in the firmament.

farewell, my love.

[audience applauding]

bravo! bravo!

[people laughing]

no, there's nothing left for me now

but to tour Canada and Australia,

god help me.

nonsense, miss Lambert.

it's not nonsense.


I've decided to retire
and let myself go.

I'll have potatoes for lunch
and potatoes for dinner.

beer. god, I love beer!

and treacle pudding and
cherry tart and cream.

cream, cream, cream, cream, cream...

[breathing deeply]

as god is my judge,

I'll never eat a lettuce leaf again.

[doorbell ringing]

oh, god, I bet I know who that is.

good afternoon, Evie.

oh, Mrs. de vries, what a surprise.

uh, I hope this isn't inconvenient

but I have to see miss Lambert

on a business matter.

she isn't having one
of her afternoon naps,

is she?

wait a minute.

[door squeaking]

guess who's here.

show her in.

business, she says, but isn't it funny

how she always manages
to time her visits

when you're lying stark bollock naked.

enough of that, you dirty-minded slut.

show her in.

Mrs. de vries.


dolly, dear. hmm.

oh, I'm so sorry.

I always seem to call when
you're--you're otherwise engaged.


tea? lovely.

ignore me. I'll--I'll just
sit here quiet as a lamb

until you're done.

so Evie said

something about business. hmm?

what? oh, yes.

um, Michael tells me you
want to close the play.

my husband's a devious little runt.

oh, that's unfair.

he was perfectly right to consult me.

we're partners. the 3 of us.

a perfect combination.

my money, his know-how, your genius.

I'm exhausted, dolly.


I feel twice my age which makes me 90.

I'm bored. life has
nothing in store for me.

you mean that or are you acting?

I never know when you're acting.

I'm not acting.

I'm near to having a breakdown.

I feel as though my
life's come to an end.

all right. all right.

all done.

oh, thank you, you're a dear.

uh.

are you really near a breakdown, Julia?

oh, I don't know. I don't know.

I'm in such an odd state at the moment.


it's as if...

it's as if the curtain's
come down on act 1,

but I have no idea
what happens in act 2.

[inaudible mimicking]

I-I'm in a sort of limbo.

waiting for something
to happen. but what?

what?

oh, please, dolly, be my friend.

oh.

make Michael take the play off.

I need a holiday.

I could visit--visit
my mother in jersey,

and then visit you in France.

oh. I could swim in
your pool. in the nuddy.



blooming florist's shop.

who sent them? Mrs. de vries?

very likely. or lord Tamerley.

here, don't forget,
you've got dinner with him

after the show tonight.

yes, I know.

expect you'll have to
turn on the waterworks

for him again as per usual.

I wish you'd teach me to cry real tears.

the times I've needed them.

oh, here's a card.


from Mr. Thomas fennel,
Tavistock square.

what a place to live.

who the hell do you suppose he is, Evie?

oh, some feller knocked all of a heap

by your fatal beauty, I expect.

probably cost a fortune.

went without dinner for a week.

oh, pull the other one.

[man singing]

beginners, please, miss Lambert.

mmm-hmm.

well, whoever Mr. Thomas fennel is,

I think it's all right

having a young man send me flowers

at my time of life.

I mean, it
just shows you--

how do you know he's a young man?

he's probably over 80.

go to hell.

[band playing]

[people talking and laughing]

I'm on my way I'm on my way

I'm busy 'cause I'm on my way

[people applauding]

thank you.

thank you.

Julia Lambert.

the champagne now, my lord?

thank you, Antoine.

and for you, madame Lambert?

I'd prefer beer but I mustn't,

so I'll make do with bubbly.

thank you.


[woman singing]

oh.

it's a portrait of Clairon.

she was a great actress,

and I believe you
have many of her gifts.

Charles, you are sweet.

I thought you might like it.

it's by way of being a parting present.

you're going away?

no. but I shan't be seeing you anymore.

oh, Charles, not again.


no. this is becoming a ritual. why?

we have such a beautiful
friendship, Julia.

it's unique in my
experience, but people talk.

they don't understand.

and even though we know the truth,

if we go on seeing one another,

there will be a terrible scandal.

no, there won't.

Michael and I lead separate lives.

that's why we're so happily married.

more or less.

jumped-up little tart,
that's what she is.

never stops acting, on-stage or off.

she's just one big pose.

dashed pretty.

shut up, Rupert, don't
show your ignorance.

I know all about her.

we were both born

in the channel islands, jersey.

her father was our
doctor. a jersey doctor!

you can't get more common than that.

it's only common sense, darling.

I don't want to lose you.

I--I have few
friends. real friends.

you're the only person in my life

with whom I can be entirely myself.

I'm terribly low at the moment.

I--I
need you.

let's go on seeing each other. please.

uh, please forgive us intruding
like this, miss Lambert.

my friend and I are
such very great admirers.

and I wonder... do you remember me?

Florence Coltraine, isn't it?


Rupert and I want you
to settle an argument.

I think I used to know
your father in jersey.

he was a doctor, wasn't he?

he used to come to
our house quite often.

actually, he was a vet.

he used to go to your house

to deliver the bitches.

the house was full of them.

life is just a bowl of cherries

don't take it serious
life's too mysterious

you work, you save you worry so

but you can't take
your dough when you go


I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

t-o-m.

you remember.

did you like
the--the flowers?

oh, Mr. Thomas fennel, Tavistock square.

yes, of course, thank you.

well, uh, I couldn't
decide between a single rose

and every flower in the store.

is that why you're here
at this time of night?

to find out if I received the flowers?

no. you see, I don't have a phone yet.

[door opening] and I...

[Wilson clearing throat]

um...

you wouldn't come to tea
with me one day, would you?

I don't see why not.

will you really?

how about next Friday?

138 Tavistock square, 4:30?


all right. I'll be there.

gee, that's swell. see you then.

the sweet things in life
to you were just loaned

so how gonna you lose
what you've never owned?

life is just a bowl of cherries

[tom and Julia laughing]

so live and laugh at it all


don't make it serious
life's too mysterious

you work, you save you worry so

but you can't take your
dough when you go go

keep on repeating "it's the berries"

the strongest oak must fall

oh?

I saw you drive up.

I'm afraid I'm on the 3rd floor.

I hope you don't mind.

and if I do?

[both chuckle]

we're there.

thank god for that.

[door squeaking]

[Julia panting]


the gas ring's in the bathroom.

oh.

it isn't the Ritz, but it's home.

no, it's--it's
charming. it's so London.

it reminds me of my early days.


I have to put coins in the gas meter.

oh, yes, so did I.

[both laughing]

have some cake. I bought it specially.

oh.

I shouldn't, but I will.



you know something? you
ought to be in movies.

real actresses don't make films.

but beautiful actresses do.

hmm.

well, I saw you in nobody's
perfect on Broadway.

I was 14 at the time.

I wish you hadn't told me that.

[both laughing]

I stood outside the stage door
and, uh, I got your autograph.

you asked me my name. I told you.

you knew how to spell it then.

[both laughing]

what's so funny?

you remind me of something.

what is it?

my husband. in a scene we had to play.

he didn't know how to sit down.

[both laughing]

Jimmie made him do it
over and over again.

uh, I can't stay long.

I must have a nap before my performance.

but you've only just arrived.

and you--you can't
go without, uh,

without, well, seeing the view.

it's really great.

if you just come over to the window...

isn't it terrific?


it's so big, but it's
also kind of friendly.

and all those people,
each with their own lives.

I can't explain it.

when I first came to London,
I stood in Piccadilly circus

looking at the lights

and the people and the taxis,

and I said out loud:

"one day I'm going to conquer you."

and you have.

have I?
I wonder--


look at my hair.

[Julia panting]

uh, here.

oh?

thank you.

and I thought you were
such a shy young man.

when am I-- when am
I gonna see you again?

you want to see me again?

what do you think?

I'll ring you up one of these days.

uh, my hat...

oh, uh...

good. well, uh, I have a phone now.

and the number's museum-4516.

so promise you'll call soon.

on my honor.


I can see myself out.

[birds twittering]

for Christ's sake, Julia,
what do you think you're doing?

you're supposed to be playing a whore,

not a schoolgirl with a
crush on her gym mistress.

you kissed him

as if you were frightened
of catching his cold.

when you kiss, you should feel

as if your bones are
melting inside your body.

tongues, darling,

that's what it's about, tongues.

now, I know you're a virgin.

don't give me the waterworks,
Julia, I'm too old for that.

you're a virgin, so what you have
to do is find a handsome young man,

like your juvenile
man, Michael Gosselyn.

go back to your rooms,

take your clothes off, lie
on the bed, open your legs

and ask him to give it to
you hot, sweet and strong.

if that doesn't improve your
acting, then nothing will.

right, let's do it again.

[Julia laughing]

what's so funny?


I feel as though
I'm a 2-year-old.

that's 88 years you've lost in a week.


tell us the secret,

we'll bottle it and make a fortune.

hmm.

[door closing]

damn it all, miss Lambert,
you don't look so bad.

you can go on
playing 25-year-olds,

30-year-olds for a
good long time yet.

and then what?

whoo!

mothers, grandmothers and old maids.


bugger playwrights.
can't write for women.

they're all men, that's the trouble.

[telephone ringing]


yes?

good morning.

[Julia laughing]

t-o-m.

you promised to call me.



as soon as I have a moment to spare.

come to tea after the matinee.

oh, I'm not falling for that one again.

how about dinner after the show then?

if you insist.

I do.

[piano playing]

on the silver screen

he melts her foolish
heart in every single scene

although she's quite
aware that here and there

are traces of the cad about the boy


lord knows she's not a fool girl

she really shouldn't care

lord knows she's not a school girl

in the flurry of her first affair

will it ever cloy this odd diversity

of misery and joy I told them

look, there's lord Crumley over there.

and I think that's lady Laweston.

what have you been reading,  Debrett's?

Debrett's? no,  the tatler.


oh, you have to know who's
who to get on in this town.

oh, you want to get on, do you?

I want to get on you, Julia.

don't be disgusting.

but I want you.

I do.

[glasses clinking]

you're the loveliest girl that one

I want you.


your conversation's
frightfully limited, tom.

dance with me.

what time is it?

oh, well, uh, I... I
forgot to put on my watch.

have you pawned it?

no, no, I just, uh,

I--I dressed in
rather a hurry tonight.

they'll never believe me

they'll never believe me

that from this great big world

you've chosen


[Julia screaming]

[continues laughing]

he treated you like a tart.

which of course is what you are.


and all the stars in the firmament.

in the wrong place!

farewell, my love.

you were wonderful tonight, my darling.


bloody marvelous.

you almost made me cry.

only almost?

I'll kill whoever set the photo.

thanks, Archie.

and what've you done to your eyes?

hmm? some new makeup?

I've never seen them
shine like that before.

your call, Mr. Dexter.

hmm.

[Archie laughing]

sorry about the photo,
it won't happen again.

hmm.

your call, miss Lambert.

you're forgiven.

[audience applauding]

what's the matter with her?

[Julia exclaiming]

darling, Julia.

you were quite wonderful tonight.

I'll say. absolutely first-rate.

thank you.

yes, I believe I was
firing on all cylinders.

and I'm starving, absolutely ravenous.

Evie, what have we
got for supper tonight?

tripe and onions.

oh, how divine. I
adore tripe and onions.

Michael, Michael, if you love me,

if you've got any spark of tenderness

in that hard heart of yours,

let me have a bottle of beer.

beer? yes.

Julia. just this once.

oh, Evie, that's for you.

uh, please?

Julia, I think it's a damn shame.


well, that you're taking the play off.

the good news is,

I've found an Italian company

who wants the theatre for 3 months,

so I said they could have it. hmm. mmm.

I'm sure your mother's
as excited as I am

at the thought of being with you.

we'll have such fun at my place, Julia.

you could do anything you like.

rest. anything.

I've changed my mind. I don't know why,

but I'm beginning to  enjoy
myself again. oh, but--

let's run through the summer

and then find something
new for the autumn.

but I've... I-I've...
I've told the Italians.

then un-tell them.

and I was so looking forward to France.

stars will be stars.

I forgot.

what?

hmm...


oh, my god. a cartier.

well spotted. when's your birthday?

November 20.

hmm.

happy birthday.

uh, but it's not November 20.

don't be so pedantic. open it.

oh, that's the one thing
I've wanted my whole life.

thank you.


uh, geez, it's lousy

I can't give you anything in return.

give me that watch you
pawned to buy me supper.

have you redeemed it yet? ah! thanks.

it'll amuse me to wear it.

I love you, Julia.


this is total insanity.
I'm old enough to be...


god, I'm a fool,

I'm such a bloody fool.

good morning, Evie. where's my wife?

in your study.

my study? mmm-hmm.

what's she doing there?

exercising.

exercising?


what are you doing?

swimming the channel, what
do you think I'm doing?

yeah, but why?


miss Phillips said my
tummy needed tightening,

so I'm tightening it.


oh.


oh, yes, I had a thought.

we should take a country house

for the summer.

what do you think?

[Julia grunting]

I'll talk to you later.

[continues grunting]

for the summer's a good idea?

yes.

golf, swimming, tennis.

it'll be especially good
for Roger. he loves golf.

then he'll have to decide
what's he gonna do with his life.

I think he should go to university.

he doesn't want to,
and we shouldn't insist.

it's his life.

oh, yes, I had another idea.

you remember that young
chap I introduced you to?

which young chap?

that American. good-looking fellow.

remember?

[clearing throat] no.

he wants to learn the business.

tom fennel's his name.

American, you must remember.

vaguely.

well, he's frightfully good at his job.

he's a wizard with money.

lots of American ideas for avoiding tax.

what about him?

well, I thought we might invite him down

for a couple of weeks to
spend his holiday with us.

why would we want to do that?

he'll be company for Roger.

he's only a bit older.

Roger will like him, I'm sure of it.

shall I ask him?

hmm.

ah!


so, will you come and stay?

Michael says the house is
frightfully comfortable.

probably not.

I'm going abroad for a couple of months.


well, you'll be busy, won't you?

looking for a new play, reading scripts.

so, what do you think?

he hasn't done justice to your eyes.

as a matter of fact,

there is a play that interests me.

it's about an older woman

who has an affair with a younger man.

oh, a farce.

why do you say that?

well, because everyone
laughs at the older woman.

no, not in this play. it's all serious.

the act 1 curtain's good.

it comes as a shock to her.

what does?

that she's fallen in love with the boy.

and it happens just when everything

seemed to her so dull and unpromising,

as if her life was over.

she finds the affair exhilarating.

and everyone keeps telling her

she looks 10 years younger.

I trust she doesn't confess to the boy

that she loves him. that's always fatal.

does it sound like something for me?

oh, don't be ridiculous, Julia.

no, your public would
never stand for it.

if such a woman asked me,

I know what advice I'd give her.

what? break it off at once.

it will only end in tears.

but, Charles, she can't do that.

why ever not?

because she's fallen in love with him,

that's why. she's helpless.

hmm.

the character in the play.

[door opens]

dolly, old thing,

how are you?

I haven't seen you for ages.

sit down and make yourself, uh,

comfy.

so, come to see that
the old firm's raking in

the dividends for you?

Michael, I'll come
straight to the point.

you know I'm not one to gossip,

but--but I'm
upset about Julia.


I think you ought to know that
people are beginning to talk.

what the devil do you mean?

well, it's absurd that at her age,

she should make herself so conspicuous

with a young boy.

oh, you mean tom fennel?
don't be such a fool, dolly.

I'm not a fool.

when someone is as well-known as Julia

and they're always seen with the
same man, naturally people talk.

tom fennel is a very
good type of American.

he's clean, honest and by
way of being a gentleman.

he's boring, dull, common and a snob.

he's just using Julia.
he's a little gold digger.

can you look me in the eyes, dolly,

and tell me you really think

Julia's having an affair with him?

no.

ah.

the truth is, Michael,
I've hardly seen her.

she never telephones anymore, and...

and...

I understand, dolly, believe me.


she's very fond of you, you know that,

but she's bound to have other friends.

I don't think chaps

should talk about their wives to others.

I think it's frightfully bad form

but let me explain
something to you about Julia.

sex doesn't mean a thing to her.

it was different in the beginning.

then she could be somewhat
tiresome sometimes.

but after she had Roger, she changed.

having a baby seemed to settle her.

all those instincts went
into her acting, you see.

gossip isn't good for business, Michael.

I mean, if Julia had one flagrant
affair after another, nobody would notice

but--but this boy,
he's half her age.

the public has always looked up to you

as such a devoted and loyal couple.

and so we are, damn it. in our way.

devoted, united, but not...

how shall I put it? not possessive.

we're a very modern couple.

[lighter clicking]


hello, daddy.

glad to be finished at Eton?

no mummy?

no, it's Saturday. she's got 2 shows.

3 and 4 pence, sir.

she'll be down first
thing in the morning.

thank you so much.

thank you, sir.

here, let me give you a hand.

she's bringing a young
chap down with her,

your age more or less.

a yank. I think you'll like him.

[birds chirping]

[I get a kick out of you
by Frank Sinatra playing]

I get no kick from champagne

mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all

so tell me why should it be true

that I get a kick out of you


nothing.

tell me.

it's... I--I--I
just don't...

I'm worried sick, that's all.

what about?

tell me, tom. what?

it's money, I owe money.

oh.

is that all?

I thought it was something serious.

well, it's ok for you, Julia,

but I just can't afford
all the things we do.

nightclubs, restaurants.

sweetheart.

how can you let a trifle
like that upset you?

don't worry about it.
I'll give you the money.

no, I--I couldn't take
any money from you.

what nonsense.

why grudge me the happiness

it gives me to get you out of a hole?

I get a kick out of you

[ducks quacking]

we might play mahjong.

do you play
mahjong, tom? no, I--

sorry, um, no can do. we're going down

to the pub to assess the local talent.


the barmaid is an absolute stunner.

god, you're all so vulgar.

well, mummy, you have an early night.

it'll do you good.

you're looking awfully fagged.

[Michael humming]

more wine?

[all clamoring]




3 words. the first word...

she'll never get this
one. never get this.



oh, um, wee. wee, wee, wee.



there you go.


very nice, Julia.

wee, wee. wee, wee. wee, wee, wee, wee.

Julia, Julia, Julia,
we're in mixed company.




winking! winking!

oh, oh, oh.

wee willie winkie! yes.

[people cheering]

yes. yes, you idiots. wee willie winkie.

Shirley Temple, god, you're stupid.

I don't get "willie."

I don't get "willie."

oh, well, they did.

It-it's an English thing.

ah.

ok.

[all chattering]



[Avice squealing]



[boys laughing]


oh, no. I just dried
off, tom, I hate you.

[tom laughing]

I'm going to get you back.


and you're running away.

you promised me a dance.

so I did, sorry.

I might be out of practice.



would you?

would I what?

tour in the second Mrs. Tanqueray

for 17 pounds a week.

and it's a 6-month tour, darling.

6 months.

no, I can't be away
from home for 6 months.

what would Archie do without me?

oh, he'll think of something.

mmm.

they're so bloody
mean, these managements.

I said, "give me 18
pounds and I'll do it."

and he said, "18 pounds? 18
pounds!" cheeky little sod.

what are you doing tonight?

I don't know.

do you know that girl's name?

which girl?

oh, that's Avice Crichton.

"you couldn't have her for 80 pounds,

never mind 18 pounds."

I thought that was witty.

don't you think that was witty?

hilarious.

well, they're not
number-one dates, darling.

oh, not at all.

Lowestoft, bournemouth and chesterfield

and Christ knows where else.

6 months...

mummy, we're going to London to have
supper and do the clubs, all right?

no. no, really not,

you've all had too much to drink.

tom hasn't. he's driving,

and one of the girls has a car.


[brakes squealing]

[crickets chirping]


[Roger groaning]

[Roger chuckling]

[car doors closing]


good night, pal.

[door squeaking]

[door closing]

are you-- are you crazy, what
do you think you're you doing?

I was about to ask you the same thing.

go back to your room.

I've hardly seen you
since you've been here.

you've seen Roger more than me.

we haven't been alone.

what's wrong with you?
you haven't held me,

you haven't kissed me.

shh.

see the state I'm in?

and--and tonight--tonight,
going off like that,

not a word to me, with that little tart.

oh, Avice Crichton is not a tart.

Avice Crichton certainly looks like one.

I'm going back to London tomorrow.

good. I hope you remember
to tip the servants

or do you want me to
give you the money, hmm?

these are yours, take them back.

don't be such a bloody little fool.

you think I like being a kept boy?

you think I like being
humiliated like this, huh?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I didn't mean it.

that makes it even worse.

I should never have let
you give me these presents.

I should never have let
you lend me that money.

by the end of the
month I'll pay you back.

I've apologized.

don't go to London tomorrow, please.


I love you, tom.

please.

I'm tired. I want to go to bed now.


the real thing, Julia,

or my name's not Jimmie Langton.

but I've got some notes.

you're still going over the top.

you've got to learn restraint.

and for Christ's sake,
stop crying, will you?

we all know you can turn your
tears on and off like a tap,

so turn them off, will you?


well, bugger me,

you really are crying
this time, aren't you?

I can't say I wasn't moved,

but you've got to learn to do it

so that it seems real.

seems to be real,
that's the art of acting.

hold the mirror up to nature, ducky,

otherwise you'll become a nervous wreck,

take to drink

and end up a piss artist
playing gin-sodden whores

all over Scotland on number-3 tours.

technique, that's what
I want you to learn.

technique.

[knocking on door]

I saw the light on. can I come in?

yes, of course. is something wrong?

no. you've been crying.

no, no, just a bad dream.

what is it, sweetheart?

we picked up a couple of girls tonight.

who did?

tom and me.

oh.

tom made me promise I wouldn't tell you.

he said you'd be furious.

were they tarts?

no, they're on the stage.

Joan asked me if I could get her

an understudy in your next play.

yes, tarts.

I just had to tell you.

tell me what?

I thought it was about time

I found out what it was all about.

Roger, what do you mean?

love.

love?

it's not that great, really.

I don't know why everybody
makes such a fuss about it.

mummy, what's the matter?

you are upset.

why are you crying?

oh, because you're such a little boy.

don't cry.

hmm.

I needed to tell you.

it had to happen sooner or later.

it makes me feel so old.

"age cannot wither her,

nor custom stale her infinite variety"

if I'd been Cleopatra,

I'd have put whoever said that to death.


to tell you the truth,
I didn't enjoy it much.

oh, you're so very, very young.

I'll grow out of it.

hmm.


I may go abroad for a while.

oh, where?

I don't know. Italy, France. abroad.

I say,

about--about
that under study,

is there any chance for Joan?

tell her to write to me.

thanks. good night.

good night, darling.

an understudy, my foot.


[footsteps approaching]

wait. hold it.

[door creaking]

it's from you know who.

I don't want to be disturbed.

good matinee?

all right,

but I'm not feeling very well.

draw up a chair. sit down.

what's the matter?

nothing. I haven't been sleeping.

I had a post card from Roger.

he's in Naples.

says he's having a great time.

yes, but you haven't come
here just to tell me that,

have you?

no, it's something else. I, uh...

I can't pay you back
the money that I owe you.

I know I said at the end of last month.

but I just don't have it.

I could pay it off.

I hate having to ask
for more time. but...

don't be such a bloody
little idiot, tom.

it's so humiliating, Julia.

geez, when you said
you'd pay my tips for me,

how do you think that made me feel?

I said I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

I was jealous of you

spending so much time with Roger.

I was jealous.

I was jealous of you going out

and having a good time without me.

is that so horrible?

I should never have
accepted anything from you.

you're everything in the world to me.

you know that.

I love being with you.
I don't want to lose you.

I have few friends. real friends.

and you're the only person in my life

with whom I can be entirely myself.


let's... let's go...


let's go on seeing each other. please.

oh, Julia.



you're lucky you can cry
without your eyelids swelling.

go to hell.

well, you're looking a lot happier,

I'll say that for you.

I hope with good reason.

if you're thinking what
I think you're thinking,

then stop thinking.

all the same, Evie,
you know what I think?

no, what do you think?

what mugs men are.

well, they can't keep
it in their trousers,

[Julia laughs] that's for sure.

you're a revolting hag.

[Julia giggling]

yes, I am happier.

everything will be all right now.


I wish I didn't.

deep down, I can't help feeling...

what?

a certain contempt for that boy.

he's so transparent.

life is just a bowl of cherries

don't make it serious
life's too mysterious

you work, you save, you worry so

but you can't take your dough
