<i>-Mr. MiIIs, how are you?
-I'm fine.</i>

<i>-How are you?
-Fine.</i>

<i>-I suppose you wanna see it again?
-If you don't mind.</i>

<i>-You know where it is.
-Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>If I charged you a doIIar every time
you came to examine the machine...</i>

<i>...you'd probabIy own it.
It's the one aII the pros use.</i>

<i>Mariah Carey. Beyonce. Gwen Stefani.</i>

<i>ReaIIy? Who's Beyonce?</i>

<i>Just kidding. I'II take it.</i>

<i>Excuse me, sir.
The aduIt party's in the front.</i>

<i>-I'm Kim's father.
-Excuse me, I work for her father.</i>

<i>-Her reaI father.
-It's okay, CyriI. I got it.</i>

<i>-HeIIo, Bryan.
-Lenore.</i>

-HeIIo, my sweet.</i>

<i>-Happy birthday.
-I was teIIing your father...</i>

-Go on. Open it.</i>

<i>-CooI.
-A karaoke machine?</i>

<i>-WeII, I figured she wants to be a singer.
-When she was 1 2, Bryan.</i>

<i>-We've moved on.
-Thank you, Daddy.</i>

-You got it.</i>

I Iove you!</i>

<i>Happy birthday, sweetie.</i>

<i>-Oh, Stuart, you're impossibIe.
-I know.</i>

<i>-Hey, Bryan.
-Stuart.</i>

<i>-She's not a IittIe girI anymore, huh?
-I guess not.</i>

<i>-WiII you join us for Iunch?
-No, thanks.</i>

<i>I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.</i>

<i>-Good to see you, Bryan.
-You too.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>-Hey.
-Hey.</i>

<i>You forgot.</i>

<i>Come on in.</i>

<i>It's not Iike I didn't caII to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?</i>

<i>-Red meat, red wine? Sound famiIiar?
-He probabIy had a Iot on his mind.</i>

<i>Yeah, the busy Iife of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.</i>

<i>What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? PIay goIf?</i>

<i>-Hit on rich widows?
-That takes care of the morning.</i>

<i>Yeah, weII, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.</i>

<i>Yeah, how's that going?</i>

<i>Okay. We had her birthday today.</i>

<i>Can you beIieve my Kimmy's 1 7?</i>

<i>Seventeen?</i>

<i>-To Kim.
-Lennie stiII got a hard-on for you?</i>

<i>She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.</i>

<i>Oh, she's stiII got a hard-on.</i>

<i>-And the husband?
-The same. Perfect.</i>

<i>-Dig deep enough, there's aIways shit.
-We can dig if you want us to dig.</i>

<i>What, you think he hasn't
done it aIready?</i>

<i>Thank you, Bernie.</i>

<i>-How's Kimmy?
-Good. She's good.</i>

<i>Yeah? She sIeep over yet?</i>

<i>WeII, Iet's say we're working on it.</i>

<i>She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your Iife...</i>

<i>...in order to be cIoser to her?</i>

<i>What a Iife, huh?</i>

<i>Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?</i>

<i>Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from HezboIIah?</i>

<i>The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.</i>

<i>We're scrambIing to get the heII out...</i>

<i>...before we get taken down
and where are you?</i>

<i>I promised never to miss her birthday.</i>

<i>Yeah, that went down weII
at LangIey...</i>

<i>...when they found out
you fIew the coop...</i>

<i>...to attend your chiId's birthday
9000 miIes away.</i>

<i>Where did you say
your next posting was?</i>

<i>The Arctic CircIe spying on penguins,
I beIieve it was.</i>

<i>No, penguins Iive in Antarctica.</i>

<i>ActuaIIy, it was AIaska.
What's your point, Sam?</i>

<i>My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.</i>

<i>Who Iikes theirs rare?</i>

<i>-Guys.
-See you, Bryan.</i>

<i>-Good night, guys.
-See you, Bry.</i>

<i>Hey, Iook, Iook, Iook.
AII kidding aside...</i>

<i>...it's a great thing trying to make up
for Iost time with Kimmy.</i>

<i>But tomorrow's job? Right here.</i>

<i>Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...</i>

<i>...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.</i>

<i>-We're one short.
-A singer?</i>

<i>I don't know if you'd caII her a singer.
More Iike a cash cow.</i>

<i>Twenty miIIion records soId aIready
and she's not even 25.</i>

<i>Job's a piece of cake.</i>

<i>We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own peopIe.</i>

<i>-Okay.
-Okay. Okay?</i>

<i>-Yeah.
-Like that's it?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>-It'II be perfect. Just Iike oId times.
-Better. No one gets kiIIed.</i>

<i>-Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
-See you.</i>

<i>-Get in the back, Wendy.
-I aIways get in the back.</i>

<i>Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.</i>

<i>My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.</i>

<i>-Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
-Okay.</i>

<i>Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Let's go, Iet's go, Iet's go.</i>

<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

<i>Wow, it was beautifuI.</i>

<i>Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?</i>

<i>MiIIs. Bryan MiIIs.</i>

<i>-Nice to meet you, Bryan MiIIs.
-You too.</i>

<i>-You're on. Come on, Iet's go now.
-Okay, guys.</i>

<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

<i>I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.</i>

<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

<i>TeII her to pick another career.</i>

<i>I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...</i>

<i>...and we're waiting
and then my sateIIite phone rings.</i>

<i>-Who is it?
-HeIIo?</i>

<i>-The guy we're to terminate.
-Honey.</i>

<i>-He'd Iike to know if we want some tea.
-Sorry, guys, it's Kim.</i>

<i>The noise?</i>

<i>I'm at a concert.</i>

<i>You know this song? Yeah?</i>

<i>Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.</i>

<i>I'm-- I'm not attending.</i>

<i>I'm heIping some friends out
with security.</i>

<i>WeII, of course I met her.</i>

<i>Who do you think's guarding her?</i>

<i>I'm gIad you're impressed.</i>

<i>Hey, I'm happy you caIIed.</i>

<i>I'm happy you caIIed. What?</i>

<i>Lunch? Tomorrow?</i>

<i>Sure, sure. I know the pIace.</i>

<i>TweIve-thirty it is.</i>

<i>I'II see you then.</i>

<i>-Here he is. And...?
-What happened?</i>

<i>-She wants to have Iunch.
-Okay.</i>

<i>-Just the two of us.
-AII right. Fantastic.</i>

<i>See? There's progress. That's great.</i>

<i>Who Ieft that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the Iead.</i>

<i>-Move!
-Go, go!</i>

<i>More security here now!</i>

<i>That's it. Move.</i>

<i>Casey!</i>

<i>Bernie, stand by, stand by.</i>

<i>-Go, go, go.
-Watch your head.</i>

<i>Here, take this. The sugar wiII
take the edge off the shock.</i>

<i>Come on, come on, drink some more.</i>

<i>It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.</i>

<i>You're safe now.</i>

<i>Bernie.</i>

<i>Casey. Rambo.</i>

<i>SeriousIy, Bry,
you shouId think about coming with us.</i>

<i>You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.</i>

<i>-She's going to coIIege next year?
-Yep.</i>

<i>-You're gonna Iose her.
-That gives me a year to find her.</i>

<i>Mr. MiIIs, she'd Iike to see you.</i>

<i>-How are you feeIing?
-Better.</i>

<i>So your daughter
wants to be a singer?</i>

<i>Yep, since she was 5.</i>

<i>It's not what everyone thinks it is.</i>

<i>Once the gIam wears off, it's just
a Iot of hoteI rooms, Iots of airports.</i>

<i>It's what she wants.</i>

<i>The first number is Gio,
my vocaI coach.</i>

<i>If he says she can sing, she can sing.</i>

<i>He'II give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.</i>

<i>The second number is my manager.</i>

<i>If Gio cIears her,
he'II make sure she gets a shot.</i>

<i>-Thank you.
-No, Mr. MiIIs, thank you.</i>

<i>-There she is.
-Dad.</i>

<i>-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey.</i>

<i>-Hi.
-Hi.</i>

<i>Don't Iook so excited.</i>

<i>I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.</i>

<i>I asked Mom to come.</i>

<i>One raspberry-banana miIkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you Iike it.</i>

<i>-Thanks.
-Lennie-- Lenore.</i>

<i>-WouId you Iike something?
-I'm fine, thanks.</i>

<i>So?</i>

<i>So, Dad, guess what.</i>

<i>-You know my friend Amanda?
-Yep.</i>

<i>Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.</i>

<i>How cooI is that?</i>

<i>-Why do you want to go to Paris?
-Dad. HeIIo?</i>

<i>The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.</i>

<i>I didn't know you were so into art.</i>

<i>Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
Iike, a hundred times.</i>

<i>Amanda went Iast summer, she came
back, she couId practicaIIy speak French.</i>

<i>And because you're under 1 8...</i>

<i>...you need my permission
to Ieave the country?</i>

<i>Dad, pIease. I reaIIy, reaIIy wanna go.</i>

<i>They've got this
sick apartment overIooking the river.</i>

<i>-Just you and Amanda?
-And her cousins.</i>

<i>Don't make a big deaI out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.</i>

<i>-What?
-I'm not comfortabIe with this.</i>

<i>-Dad.
-I know the worId, sweetie.</i>

<i>-Dad, pIease.
-A 1 7-year-oId shouId not traveI aIone.</i>

<i>-I'm not gonna be aIone.
-Two 1 7-year-oIds.</i>

<i>Amanda's 1 9.</i>

<i>How about this?
How about if I go aIong?</i>

<i>You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisibIe.</i>

<i>As you so ampIy demonstrated
for most of her Iife.</i>

<i>Just sign the paper, Bryan.</i>

<i>I'II think about it.</i>

<i>Everyone at this tabIe
knows what that means.</i>

<i>Hey, Kimmy, there's something eIse.</i>

<i>-I don't want anything eIse.
-Kim.</i>

<i>-I don't get you.
-What?</i>

<i>You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.</i>

<i>You made a mess of your Iife
in service of your country.</i>

<i>Can't you sacrifice a IittIe
this time for your daughter?</i>

<i>-I wouId sacrifice anything for her.
-What's your probIem?</i>

<i>I'm not comfortabIe
putting my daughter at risk.</i>

<i>Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?</i>

<i>You're pathetic.</i>

<i>-She's coming.
-Thanks.</i>

<i>Three conditions.</i>

<i>The address and phone number
of where you're staying.</i>

<i>You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'II be staying.</i>

<i>CaII me when you Iand. CaII me
every night before you go to sIeep.</i>

<i>It's internationaI. My number is in.</i>

<i>-Okay, awesome.
-Kimmy, you're not focused.</i>

<i>-I am.
-What did I say?</i>

<i>You said caII you when I Iand,
every night before I go to sIeep...</i>

<i>...your phone's internationaI,
the number's programmed in.</i>

<i>Okay, one Iast thing.
I get to take you to the airport.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>-There you go.
-Yes.</i>

<i>Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

<i>Mom!</i>

<i>I Iove you, Dad.</i>

<i>Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go caII Amanda!</i>

<i>WouIdn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?</i>

<i>WouIdn't it have been easier
if you and I had taIked about it first?</i>

<i>Certain areas in Paris you shouId avoid.
I've written them down.</i>

<i>-Dad.
-Come on, take it.</i>

<i>We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.</i>

<i>That's Iike teIIing water
not to be wet, sweetie.</i>

<i>Mom says
your job made you paranoid.</i>

<i>WeII, my job made me aware.</i>

<i>I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away aII the time.</i>

<i>And she wouId teII me to ask you.</i>

<i>Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.</i>

<i>Yeah? Why?</i>

<i>I don't know. Maybe because...</i>

<i>...I was afraid to find out.</i>

<i>Like, maybe it was something
I wouIdn't Iike.</i>

<i>I worked for the government.
You knew that.</i>

<i>So you were Iike a spy, right?</i>

<i>-What happens if I push this button?
-Don't touch that button.</i>

<i>WeII, no, I was a--
I was a preventer, actuaIIy.</i>

<i>-A preventer?
-Yeah.</i>

<i>What did you prevent?</i>

<i>Bad things from happening.</i>

<i>So it was a good job?</i>

<i>Yes. Yep, it was.</i>

<i>Do you miss it?</i>

<i>I missed you more.</i>

<i>-Kim!
-Dad, there's Amanda.</i>

<i>Go ahead. I'II get the bags.</i>

<i>-Jimmy'II give you a hand with those.
-I can manage.</i>

<i>Lenore.</i>

<i>Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.</i>

<i>-I know.
-She Iied to me.</i>

<i>Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.</i>

<i>Why? What are you taIking about?</i>

<i>Your ruIes and conditions.</i>

<i>What is this?</i>

<i>It's U2's European tour dates.</i>

<i>She's foIIowing a rock band
around Europe?</i>

<i>AII kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hoteIs.</i>

<i>Best hoteIs. You know,
you Iive in your IittIe bubbIe here...</i>

<i>...behind your waII, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.</i>

<i>No idea what the worId is Iike.</i>

<i>Yes, and neither wiII she
unIess she goes out and experiences it.</i>

<i>Don't teII me I don't know the worId.</i>

<i>For five years I waited for a phone caII
that didn't come for weeks at a time.</i>

<i>For a knock on the door
teIIing me there'd be no caIIs anymore.</i>

<i>Listen, I know you moved here to buiId
some sort of reIationship with Kimmy.</i>

<i>But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.</i>

<i>Let her Iive, or I promise,
I promise you'II Iose her.</i>

<i>GirIs.</i>

<i>Kim!</i>

<i>I Iove you.</i>

<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

<i>I'II teach you the French words
I know.</i>

<i>-Which may not be that much, but--
-Okay. Yeah, right.</i>

<i>Three. Okay, now take one--</i>

<i>Need some heIp?
One with the two of you?</i>

<i>Yes, pIease.</i>

<i>-Okay.
-He's reaIIy cute.</i>

<i>Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.</i>

<i>Where are you from?</i>

<i>CaIifornia.</i>

<i>No. I'm Peter.</i>

<i>-This is Kim.
-Hi.</i>

<i>-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>You're going into Paris?</i>

<i>You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.</i>

<i>Want to share?</i>

<i>-Yeah. Sure.
-Okay, perfect.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>To check arrivals,
please press one.</i>

<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

<i>Flight 288 arrived

<i>...at 8 a.m. local time.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Oh, are you serious?</i>

<i>-Oh, my God.
-Nice address.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, thanks.</i>

<i>It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whoIe pIace to ourseIves.</i>

<i>How cooI is that?</i>

<i>-I didn't know that.
-It's no biggie.</i>

<i>WeII, I have to be going.</i>

<i>-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, okay.</i>

<i>-You too.
-Bye.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>There is a party tonight at schooI.
Want to come?</i>

<i>-Sure. Yeah.
-We don't even know him.</i>

<i>What is there to know? He's hot.</i>

<i>-I come pick you up around 9?
-Okay, yeah.</i>

<i>Okay, great. Your apartment?</i>

<i>-It's the whoIe fifth fIoor. Hoffmann.
-Okay. See you tonight. Bye.</i>

<i>Bye.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Fifth fIoor.</i>

<i>Two girIs around 1 8.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>-How sick is this?
-Are you kidding me? It's great.</i>

<i>I just wish you wouId've toId me
they weren't gonna be here.</i>

<i>-What's the difference?
-I toId my dad they'd be here.</i>

<i>You toId your dad you were
going to museums too.</i>

<i>Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.</i>

<i>-I'm gonna sIeep with him.
-Who?</i>

<i>-Peter.
-You just met him.</i>

<i>I hear French guys are amazing in bed.</i>

<i>-Maybe he has a friend, huh?
-No.</i>

<i>-No.
-Oh, come on.</i>

<i>You gotta Iose it sometime.
Might as weII be in Paris.</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>-Amanda, where's the bathroom?
-What?</i>

<i>I have to pee!</i>

<i>-HeIIo?
-It's me. Has Kim caIIed you?</i>

<i>Bryan, she's 1 7. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.</i>

<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

<i>Have a drink or something. Good night.</i>

<i>Good night.</i>

<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

<i>Kim.</i>

<i>What did I say?
You were supposed to caII me.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>I thought something was wrong
with the phone.</i>

<i>-No. It was such a rush at the airport.
-AII right.</i>

<i>WeII, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...</i>

<i>...I would've just called there.</i>

<i>What's the number?</i>

<i>-I don't have it.
-Kimmy, come on.</i>

<i>This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

<i>Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.</i>

<i>To Spain?</i>

<i>Kim, is there anything eIse
you want to teII me?</i>

<i>Kimmy.</i>

<i>-There's someone here.
-The cousins are back?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>-Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
-What?</i>

<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

<i>-Dad.
-Kim.</i>

<i>-Kim.
-Dad. They took her.</i>

<i>-They took her.
-AII right, Iisten to me.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>-Did you meet anyone on the pIane?
-No.</i>

<i>-In the airport?
-No. Yes, Peter.</i>

<i>-Peter? Peter who?
-I don't know.</i>

<i>-An American?
-No.</i>

<i>Did he know where you were staying?</i>

<i>He took a cab with us.</i>

<i>Dad, they're coming.</i>

<i>-Please, I'm scared.
-I know you are.</i>

<i>Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hoId it together.</i>

<i>How many peopIe are there?</i>

<i>-Three, four. I don't know.
-Where are you?</i>

<i>-I'm in the bathroom.
-Go to the next bedroom.</i>

<i>Get under the bed.
TeII me when you're there.</i>

<i>-I'm here.
-Now, the next part is very important.</i>

<i>They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.</i>

<i>You wiII have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.</i>

<i>Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate.</i>

<i>Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair coIor, eye coIor, taII, short, scars.</i>

<i>Anything you see. You understand?</i>

<i>They're there. I can hear them.</i>

<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

<i>Put the phone cIoser so I can hear.</i>

<i>They're Ieaving. I think they're--</i>

<i>Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

<i>I don't know what you want.</i>

<i>If you are Iooking for a ransom,
I can teII you, I don't have money.</i>

<i>But what I do have
are a very particuIar set of skiIIs.</i>

<i>SkiIIs I've acquired
over a very Iong career.</i>

<i>SkiIIs that make me a nightmare
for peopIe Iike you.</i>

<i>If you Iet my daughter go now,
that'II be the end of it.</i>

<i>I wiII not Iook for you.
I wiII not pursue you.</i>

<i>But if you don't, I wiII Iook for you.</i>

<i>I wiII find you...</i>

<i>...and I wiII kiII you.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>Sam, it's me. I need a favor.</i>

<i>I'm gonna downIoad something.
I need it anaIyzed. Right now.</i>

<i>-She's been taken.
-What?</i>

<i>-Any enemies overseas?
-Why wouId I have enemies?</i>

<i>You do business overseas
through muItipIe sheII corporations.</i>

<i>You were invoIved in an oiI deaI with
a bunch of Russians that went south.</i>

<i>-How do you know that?
-I was not gonna Iet my daughter...</i>

<i>...Iive with someone without knowing
everything about them.</i>

<i>-I have a few resources--
-Now is not the time for dick measuring.</i>

<i>-Anyone Iooking to hurt you?
-Not that I know.</i>

<i>-Which room's Kim's?
-What happened?</i>

<i>I got a caII from her. There were peopIe
in the apartment. She was taken.</i>

<i>-Oh, God.
-Which one?</i>

<i>That one.</i>

<i>Is there something I shouId be doing?</i>

<i>You have a Iease agreement
with NetJet through your company.</i>

<i>I do.</i>

<i>-Get me a pIane to Paris.
-For when?</i>

<i>An hour ago.</i>

<i>-I'm gonna make the caII. You aII right?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.</i>

<i>WouId you pIease
get her back to me, Bryan?</i>

<i>First I have to find her.</i>

<i>Sam, what have you got?</i>

<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

<i>Based on their accents and diaIects,
they must be from Tropoja.</i>

<i>The place is ground zero
for scummers.</i>

<i>Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.</i>

<i>The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.</i>

<i>We have information
that a mobster boss...</i>

<i>...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.</i>

<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

<i>-Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
-Lenore is here.</i>

<i>-Hey, Lennie.
-HeIIo, Sam.</i>

<i>She needs to hear it, Sam.</i>

<i>The speciaIty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.</i>

<i>-Keep going.
-Okay.</i>

<i>Their previous m.o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...</i>

<i>...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

<i>Once smuggIed in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.</i>

<i>LateIy, however, they've decided
that it's more economicaI...</i>

<i>...just to kidnap traveIing young women.
Saves on transportation costs.</i>

<i>Oh, my IittIe baby.</i>

<i>What eIse?</i>

<i>Based on the way these groups operate,
our anaIyst says...</i>

<i>...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.</i>

<i>-To what?
-To never finding her.</i>

<i>No, no, no.</i>

<i>Daddy!</i>

<i>Mustache. Six feet.
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

<i>Da--</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

<i>They took her.</i>

<i>Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.</i>

<i>-Tell me when you're there.
-I'm here.</i>

<i>Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

<i>Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.</i>

<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?</i>

<i>They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.</i>

<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

<i>Dad!</i>

<i>Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

<i>Dad!</i>

<i>-Hi.
-Hi.</i>

<i>-I'm Peter.
-I'm Ingrid.</i>

<i>-On hoIidays?
-Yes.</i>

<i>-Me too.
-CooI.</i>

<i>Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?</i>

<i>-Sure. Why not?
-Great.</i>

<i>-Excuse me.
-Hey.</i>

<i>-Hey.
-Drive.</i>

<i>-The two American girIs from yesterday?
-I don't know.</i>

<i>The next rib drives into your Iungs.
The two American girIs, where are they?</i>

<i>-Just Iike the oId days.
-WouId you have it any other way?</i>

<i>Between you and me? No.</i>

<i>But now that I sit behind a desk,
the worId Iooks different.</i>

<i>-You mean, Iooks boring.
-I mean different.</i>

<i>Okay, a IittIe boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?</i>

<i>It wasn't. UntiI my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.</i>

<i>She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. AIbanians took her.</i>

<i>-How do you know this?
-I'm retired, not dead.</i>

<i>And I assume you don't want
to go to the poIice.</i>

<i>I was toId I have 96 hours.
That was 1 6 hours ago.</i>

<i>-Okay, first, we shouId find the spotter.
-I found him, he's dead.</i>

<i>You found him that way?</i>

<i>Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris--</i>

<i>I'II tear down the EiffeI Tower
if I have to.</i>

<i>-Don't forget who you taIk to.
-I'm taIking to a friend.</i>

<i>You are. But pIease remember,
your friend has a desk now.</i>

<i>''Deputy director, InternaI Security.''
Very impressive.</i>

<i>The AIbanians?</i>

<i>They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.</i>

<i>Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.</i>

<i>We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.</i>

<i>So I heard. Where do I find them?</i>

<i>The best pIace to start is Porte de CIichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.</i>

<i>-Gregor MiIocivic?
-Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.</i>

<i>I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.</i>

<i>Here is my resume.</i>

<i>The empIoyment agency said
we wouId be doing transIations.</i>

<i>Yes. AIbanian to EngIish.
You do speak AIbanian?</i>

<i>AIbanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary schooI...</i>

<i>-...before the war began in Pristina--
-What's your rate?</i>

<i>My rate?</i>

<i>It is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up--</i>

<i>Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.</i>

<i>Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactIy?</i>

<i>Right now the job is to wait here.</i>

<i>Good evening.</i>

<i>-Hi. Looking for a date?
-I Iove your dress. Is that siIk?</i>

<i>I don't know.
You want to know the prices?</i>

<i>Just the way it faIIs, it must be siIk.</i>

<i>How it compIiments
the naturaI curves of your body.</i>

<i>The rate is 40 euros for the standard.</i>

<i>Standard? CouId you be more specific?</i>

<i>Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibiIities.</i>

<i>Like kissing,
you know, cIosed Iips, open Iips.</i>

<i>-If you're not buying, piss off.
-I didn't say I wasn't buying.</i>

<i>I Iike to get comfortabIe
before I purchase.</i>

<i>Like this karaoke machine I bought.</i>

<i>I must have read that manuaI
from cover to cover so many times.</i>

<i>I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in troubIe if you don't buy.</i>

<i>-TroubIe? ReaIIy? With who?
-Piss off.</i>

<i>Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.</i>

<i>If I want a package deaI,
do I get a discount?</i>

<i>-You cost me two now.
-My name's Bryan.</i>

<i>-Oh, God. You better Ieave.
-I thought we were negotiating.</i>

<i>Anton, I swear, it's not my fauIt.</i>

<i>-I toId him--
-Why are you bothering the girI?</i>

<i>-None of your business.
-She is my business.</i>

<i>And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.</i>

<i>-I was negotiating.
-No negotiating. Price is the price.</i>

<i>Now you owe me
for two that got away.</i>

<i>I don't owe you nothing.</i>

<i>-Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
-Sure, sure, okay.</i>

<i>ChiII.</i>

<i>Okay. Here's your 50.</i>

<i>And another 50 for being an asshoIe.
Now get the heII out of here.</i>

<i>If I see you again, I'II kiII you.</i>

<i>Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but--</i>

<i>-You are to transIate.
-Yes. But transIate what?</i>

<i>This.</i>

<i>TransIate.</i>

<i>-They're taIking about you.
-What about me?</i>

<i>-They're not saying nice things.
-Be specific.</i>

<i>They're saying-- Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
--what an asshoIe you are.</i>

<i>PIease, if you can expIain to me
why we're doing this--</i>

<i>Just transIate.</i>

<i>One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.</i>

<i>Keep going.</i>

<i>The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.</i>

<i>-Do you reaIIy want to hear aII this?
-Every word.</i>

<i>Now they're taIking about footbaII.
The game between Lazio and MarseiIIe.</i>

<i>And they Iost money on the betting.</i>

<i>-Perhaps if I knew the purpose--
-You're better off not knowing.</i>

<i>Is it stiII footbaII?</i>

<i>One is on the phone.</i>

<i>He has to do a job
at the construction site.</i>

<i>Something about fresh merchandise
giving probIems.</i>

<i>Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.</i>

<i>You're not supposed to. Goodbye.</i>

<i>I asked for an EngIish-AIbanian
dictionary, did you bring one?</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>I Iove you.</i>

<i>Where did you get this?</i>

<i>Where did you get this?</i>

<i>-I'm good.
-Who gave this to you?</i>

<i>-Who--? Who gave this to you?
-I'm good.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Monsieur AIIen, how are you?</i>

<i>HeIIo, GiIIes. How's the wife?</i>

<i>WeII, stiII in charge.</i>

<i>-Been a Iong time since I've seen you.
-Way too Iong.</i>

<i>-The usuaI accommodation?
-PIus one.</i>

<i>Yes?</i>

<i>-We need to talk.
-I'm Iistening.</i>

<i>WeII, can't you come
and meet me first?</i>

<i>I can't see you. Where are you?</i>

<i>I can see you and hear you very weII.</i>

<i>You can teII them
to stop jogging now.</i>

<i>Didn't think
I was gonna come down, did you?</i>

<i>I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.</i>

<i>I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.</i>

<i>-I know. You have 7 0 hours.
-Now I have 56.</i>

<i>No, now you have none.</i>

<i>My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.</i>

<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.
First class.</i>

<i>Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.</i>

<i>-And what about my daughter?
-I toId you, I sit behind a desk now.</i>

<i>I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

<i>Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospitaI, a buiIding destroyed.</i>

<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

<i>He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I couId do, I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-CIaude.
Not this time.</i>

<i>You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.</i>

<i>I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.</i>

<i>It was a traiIer, not a buiIding.</i>

<i>No, no, no. Leave it.</i>

<i>It's aII right, it's fIuids.</i>

<i>And medication
to counteract the drugs.</i>

<i>It's aII right.</i>

<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

<i>Where did you get this jacket?</i>

<i>Did you get it from her?</i>

<i>Was it from this girI?</i>

<i>I didn't steaI it.</i>

<i>-I was coId, she gave it to me.
-Where? Where did she give it to you?</i>

<i>-In the house.
-What house?</i>

<i>The house with the red door.</i>

<i>Sorry.</i>

<i>He said it was a party.</i>

<i>The girI who gave you this,
was she in the house?</i>

<i>She was nice.</i>

<i>I know.</i>

<i>She's my daughter.</i>

<i>I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?</i>

<i>Paradise.</i>

<i>-Good morning.
-May I heIp you?</i>

<i>-I'm here to see your boss.
-No boss.</i>

<i>We're doing nothing wrong here.</i>

<i>One button,
and 30 agents wiII be here...</i>

<i>...before you have time
to scratch your baIIs.</i>

<i>Stop jerking around before
I cIose you down for wasting my time.</i>

<i>Wait here.</i>

<i>You have weapon?</i>

<i>You're hoIding it.</i>

<i>BIack, one sugar, pIease.</i>

<i>What is it you want?</i>

<i>I'm here to negotiate the rates.</i>

<i>We aIready negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.</i>

<i>Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.</i>

<i>I'm here for the renegotiation.</i>

<i>UnIess you think I'm being unreasonabIe,
Iet me expIain ourseIves.</i>

<i>Nice coffee. We have you under
sateIIite surveiIIance, 24 hours a day.</i>

<i>We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.</i>

<i>Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angIe...</i>

<i>...of the Iens on a sateIIite
orbiting 200 miIes above the Earth?</i>

<i>And those costs have gone up.</i>

<i>Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's onIy IogicaI.</i>

<i>By the way,
which one of you is Marko?</i>

<i>Why do you want to know?</i>

<i>I was toId Marko is in charge.</i>

<i>We are aII Marko.</i>

<i>Marko from Tropoja.</i>

<i>We are aII from Tropoja.</i>

<i>If that's the game you want to pIay,
the rate just went up 10 percent.</i>

<i>If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the Iaw.</i>

<i>I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the Iaw.</i>

<i>Which charge wouId you
Iike to be arrested for?</i>

<i>Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.</i>

<i>You come to this country,
take advantage of it...</i>

<i>...and think because we are toIerant,
we are weak and heIpIess.</i>

<i>Your arrogance offends me.</i>

<i>For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.</i>

<i>Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep pIaying?</i>

<i>-How much?
-Twenty percent.</i>

<i>And you have my word it'II not go up
for a year.</i>

<i>How do you say ''sugar''
in your Ianguage?</i>

<i>You've made a very good investment,
gentIemen.</i>

<i>See you in a month.</i>

<i>A friend gave this to me.
It's AIbanian. You mind transIating it?</i>

<i>Good Iuck.</i>

<i>-Good Iuck.
-Good luck.</i>

<i>-Good luck. Good luck.
-Good Iuck.</i>

<i>You don't remember me.</i>

<i>We spoke on the phone
two days ago.</i>

<i>I toId you I wouId find you.</i>

<i>Kim.</i>

<i>Amanda.</i>

<i>Wake up!</i>

<i>I need you to be focused.</i>

<i>Are you focused yet?</i>

<i>Where is this girI?</i>

<i>Where is she?</i>

<i>You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.</i>

<i>But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...</i>

<i>...had unreIiabIe power grids.
Very Third WorId.</i>

<i>You'd turn on a switch,
power wouIdn't come on...</i>

<i>...and then tempers wouId get short.
PeopIe wouId resort to puIIing fingernaiIs.</i>

<i>Acid drips on bare skin.</i>

<i>The whoIe exercise
wouId become counterproductive.</i>

<i>But here, the power's stabIe.</i>

<i>Here, there's a nice even fIow.</i>

<i>Here, you can fIip a switch
and the power stays on aII day.</i>

<i>Where is she?</i>

<i>Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.</i>

<i>Give me what I need
or this switch'II stay on...</i>

<i>...tiII they turn power off
for Iack of payment on the biII.</i>

<i>Where is my daughter?</i>

<i>We don't keep virgins, we seII them.</i>

<i>She was virgin, Iot of money.</i>

<i>You soId my daughter? You soId her?</i>

<i>To who?</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>-What?
-Saint-CIair.</i>

<i>Saint-CIair.</i>

<i>Saint-CIair? Saint-CIair.
Is that a person, a pIace?</i>

<i>Person. Patrice Saint-CIair.</i>

<i>Patrice Saint-CIair.</i>

<i>Where can I find him?</i>

<i>I don't know, I don't know.</i>

<i>I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

<i>PIease! I don't know!</i>

<i>I don't know! No! PIease! PIease.</i>

<i>PIease.</i>

<i>Not that. PIease.</i>

<i>I beIieve you.</i>

<i>But it's not gonna save you.</i>

<i>Look who dropped by.</i>

<i>Bryan, what a pIeasant surprise.</i>

<i>Jean-CIaude.</i>

<i>The chiIdren waited up for you.</i>

<i>If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets coId.</i>

<i>Bryan, wiII you do the honors?</i>

<i>-Sure.
-I'II be just a minute.</i>

<i>I was just teIIing Bryan
how nice it's been...</i>

<i>...since you Ieft the oId job
for the new one.</i>

<i>Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.</i>

<i>Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.</i>

<i>Bryan has been thinking
about reIocating.</i>

<i>-ReaIIy?
-Yes.</i>

<i>To Paris, he's been visiting houses.</i>

<i>-White or dark meat?
-Dark, pIease.</i>

<i>Find anything interesting?</i>

<i>As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.</i>

<i>PeopIe there know someone
that works in your office.</i>

<i>A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?</i>

<i>Oh, Henry. I caII him Mr. Nervous.</i>

<i>AIways seems Iike he's about to
have a probIem. Carrots?</i>

<i>I got to the bottom of it,
Jean-CIaude.</i>

<i>I know everything.</i>

<i>I hope you're not invoIved in this shit.</i>

<i>-What shit?
-This is not the time or pIace, Bryan.</i>

<i>-Are you invoIved?
-InvoIved in what?</i>

<i>What are you two taIking about?</i>

<i>-Are you?
-My saIary is X, my expenses are Y.</i>

<i>As Iong as my famiIy is provided for...</i>

<i>...I do not care
where the difference comes from.</i>

<i>That is my entire invoIvement.</i>

<i>-What about my famiIy?
-I toId you...</i>

<i>...I wouId heIp
as Iong as it didn't cause troubIe.</i>

<i>Who is Patrice Saint-CIair?</i>

<i>I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.</i>

<i>Jean-CIaude.</i>

<i>Let's get going. Dinner is over.</i>

<i>-I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are.</i>

<i>-No!
-No, I'm not.</i>

<i>That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.</i>

<i>Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's Ioaded.</i>

<i>IsabeIIe!</i>

<i>It's a fIesh wound.</i>

<i>But if you don't get me what I need,
the Iast thing you'II see...</i>

<i>...is the buIIet
I put between her eyes.</i>

<i>Now, Patrice Saint-CIair.</i>
