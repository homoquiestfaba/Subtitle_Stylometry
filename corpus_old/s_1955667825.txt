(DOG BARKING)

MICHAEL: Yeah?

No, no. No, we're leaving Cannes now.


They say we'll cut
production costs in half!

No, a vacation can wait.

Yeah, Annie knows. She understands.

Oh, right, I met with
Mr. Yamamoto this morning.

He finally said yes to our deal.

threw my back out bowing.

(MICHAEL CHUCKLES)

Okay, later.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

Mmm.

(INHALES SHARPLY) You have no idea

how good this tastes
after seaweed and fish.

Why can't the Japanese
distributors just serve croissants?

I mean, we're in France, for Christ sakes.

Can I offer you some delicious cold coffee?

Let me see.
Oh...

I gotta keep packing. (INHALES SHARPLY)

Ooh.

(DOG BARKING)

You okay?

Oh, I'll be fine, it's just my ears, you know.
(CLEARS THROAT)

Right.

Oh, come on, 100 camels?

Where the hell are we gonna get
100 camels, for Christ sakes?

What does the script say?

Goats. I thought so. And those
Moroccan goats work cheap.

You tell the director, no more creativity.

He's gonna use the goddamn goats...

And he's lucky he still has a job. Okay?

Have I mentioned that
overseas production is a bitch?

ANNE: Mmm-hmm.

Seriously, 12 euros for a
bottle of water. (CHUCKLES)

And look, they charged you for a
hamburger and a cheese sandwich.

Well, I wanted a cheeseburger,
but I couldn't order one...

So, I got both and I made my own.

Honey, what are you working so hard for

if your wife can't have a
cheeseburger when she wants one?

Baby, I'd buy you a billion cheeseburgers,

but you know how much I
hate wasteful extravagance.

Ah, yes. Because your
cufflinks were such a bargain.


Thank you.

Now let me check those little ears.

So sweet.

(BARKING DOG RINGTONE RINGS)

Yeah. Okay. I'll be right down.

Honey, would you call the bellman?

Have him come up and get my bags.

WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) <i>We're
sorry, all lines are busy.</i>

(WOMAN SPEAKS FRENCH)
Ugh...

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Excuse me.

Oh, sorry.

<i>Madame,</i> I'm so sorry.

Would you please hold this under Lockwood?

Thank you.
You're welcome.

WOMAN: (IN FRENCH ACCENT)
It was my real dream to act.

And so I went to Paris seven years ago.

And it was a wonderful experience.

It's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh.

MICHAEL: I enjoyed
talking to you. Good luck.

Pleasure to meet you, too.

Hi, honey.

<i>Bonjour,</i> Anne.

ANNE: Hello, Jacques.

You're all set. I've checked
you out and the car is waiting.

You look lovely.
She does, doesn't she?

Come on.
(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

Mr. Lockwood, can I have a photo?

Thank you.

Your driver is here.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

I read the script.

Yes?

And I'm telling you, it
could be a little classic,

and it's commercial, too.

Classic and commercial?
Come on. Let's go produce it!

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Only for a minute.

What's the matter?

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

What the hell?

Oh, Michael, you know I am
not a whiner, but my ears...

Oh, baby, I'm sorry. You'll be able to rest

when we get to Budapest.

And wait till you see where we're staying.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(MICHAEL CLEARS THROAT)

It's Mario. Uh, what's my inseam?

34 inches.

86 centimeters.
Ah.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

The food on the plane will not be
food. So I got you something good.

Try this sausage.

The old man in that shop makes it himself.

Mmm.

And look at this Dijon mustard.

It's Edmond Fallot. The best in France!

Anne, here are some drops for your ears.

(JACQUES SPEAKS FRENCH)

Thank you, Jacques.

Our director in Morocco
has gone completely crazy.

He's into double overtime every day.

He seduced his leading lady but
now they're fighting on the set.

It's a nightmare.

had three straight hits.

Relax, we can trust him.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

What's he doing now?

I don't know.

(JACQUES SPEAKS FRENCH)

(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)

JACQUES: Mmm.

(IN ENGLISH) Smell that perfume!
(GASPS)

JACQUES: And it's full of vitamins!

Mmm.

Thank you.
You're welcome.


Ah...

I can't believe Laszlo sent this.

I told you he wants to
be in business with us.

Be careful, because
he's not a generous man.

<i>Madame.</i>
Yes?

I notice your ears seem
to be bothering you.

Well, yes.

I must warn you that the cabin
pressure can be quite painful.

I don't recommend you fly today.

Thank you.


Michael, I think I should skip Budapest

and just go straight to Paris.

What?

Yeah.

I mean, you're gonna be
working the whole time anyway.

Well, honey, I'm just sorry I
didn't know you were feeling so bad.

May I make a suggestion?

I'll take care of her.

Really?
Yes.

I have meetings tomorrow morning in Paris

and I'm driving back now.
(PLANES FLYING OVERHEAD)

Oh, that's fine. I can
take the train, it's fine.

Everybody's leaving Cannes
today. The trains are full.

So, let me drive you.
Uh...


but you sure it's okay with you?

Uh...

You'll be there by dinner time.

Look, I don't bite.


You rest up in Paris. I'll call you tonight.
(BARKING RINGTONE)

Baby, I love you. Uh...

Hold on one second please.

I gotta go. Bye.

ANNE: Michael!
(MICHAEL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

This is a lovely car.

Yes. She's with me for a long time.
Hmm.

No, no, no, no. You need lunch. Come.

Oh.
Here.

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

I like to stay here when I'm in Cannes,

away from the crowd at the beach.

It's a beautiful day.

Are you nervous?

Maybe. A little bit.

We've never actually been alone together.

me when I said I don't bite.


(WAITER SPEAKING FRENCH)

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Uh, would
you like a glass of wine?

Mmm-mmm.

No, no.

No, no. Thank you.

Yes!

When in France. (CHUCKLES)

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

You'll like this wine,
it's Chateauneuf-du-Pape.

Ooh. That's good!


<i>Merci.</i>

This wine goes well with your
ham <i>de</i> Bayonne and melon.

<i>Merci.</i>

Mmm.

It's delicious! (GASPS) Mmm.

I know it's rude, but, Anne,
I may have to take some calls.

It's okay. I'm used to it.


(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Anne, a deal offer is like a
souffle. It's all about timing.

Yes, you don't want it to collapse.

Yes?

No, tell him I'm not in
unless the UK comes in for 30%.


(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Okay?

Excuse me a minute.
Mmm.


(MUSIC PLAYING)
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

(JACQUES SPEAKING FRENCH)

Anne, I need a credit
card. Do you have one?

Don't you have a credit card?

Oh, I have many.

I explain later.

Okay.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

Just to hold the hotel
reservation until we get there.

Did you say hotel?

Yes.

Jacques, we're going to Paris.

Of course, of course, but you need rest.

There is a fine inn with
an excellent restaurant.

And it's truffle season!

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

It doesn't work?

I need to open the door for you.
Oh.



So how are your ears?

Oh, I hope those drops
will help. Thank you.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO)
Ah!

Mozart, we couldn't do better.

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

So let's pretend we don't
know where we're going

or even who we are.


(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

Oh. You see that mountain over there?

ANNE: Yeah.
It's St. Victoire.

Uh-huh.

Do you see that truck right in front of us!

JACQUES: It's a major
landmark of this region,

and a favorite subject for
many writers and artists.

Cezanne captured it perfectly.

I saw a beautiful exhibition of his
work last year in Aix-en-Provence.

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

That's great.
Yeah.

Oh, it must have been incredible to see

Cezanne's paintings here in this light.

Yeah.


The ones that I know at the Met in
New York, they look a little sad.

You know, as if they don't
really want to be there.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC CONTINUES)

(MUSIC STOPS)

I like to stop about every hour.

and have a cigarette.

It's been 42 minutes.

Yeah.

ANNE: Hmm.

She gets thirsty.

Ah.

I hope my smoking isn't bothering you.

Ah. Actually it reminds me of my father.

He smoked two packs of
Camel cigarettes a day.

He died at 56.

Oh. See that hilltop over there?

See those old stone walls and that castle?

The Romans were all through this area.

Did you know that this
region is called Provence

because it was a province of Rome?

No.
Yes. Ha.

Michael and I have flown from
the south of France to Paris,

but we've never driven.

Driving is the only way to see a country.

ANNE: I've always wanted to
see the lavender in bloom.


JACQUES: I'll show you something.

(JACQUES SPEAKS FRENCH)

Anne, you know, I'm
happy to be here with you

because it's the first time I've
come back here since I was a kid.

ANNE: (GASPS) Oh, my God!

Oh!

JACQUES: Yeah.
(GASPS) It's incredible.

It's part of an aqueduct
built when the Romans

were at the height of their power,

just to impress their subjects.

Well, I'm impressed.
(CHUCKLES)

ANNE: Two-thousand years ago?
Yeah.


They were great stonemasons.

People canoe on this river.

ANNE: Huh.

That sounds fun.

Yeah.

I can't remember the last time

Michael and I played
hooky for the afternoon.

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

You've got to taste the <i>noisette,
nocciola.</i> Mmm, it's great.

<i>cassis.</i> And <i>fraise des bois.</i>

(JACQUES AND WOMAN SPEAKING FRENCH)

(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

That's pretty good.

(JACQUES SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

ANNE: Look, wild lupine.

We have wild lupine in California.

Oh, yes, but you can't eat them.

Well, no. (CHUCKLES)


Mmm. With a little olive oil,
crushed anchovies, salt and pepper...

They make a marvelous salad.
(CHUCKLES)

I'm sure the Romans ate them.

Does everything remind you of eating?

Yes.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Stay, please. The light is perfect.

JACQUES: Mmm?

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

Yeah?
Turn a little.

Oh, yes. Now come in close.

It's great.

Oh, yeah.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(MAN SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(CHUCKLES)
(JACQUES CONTINUES TALKING)

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

This is Erik Satie. He
was a very eccentric man.

Did you know he never washed his shirts?

So, his wife did them?

No, he did not have a wife.

No?

No, not everyone has to
have a wife to be happy.

So, when his shirts got
dirty, he just threw them away.

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

JACQUES: Mmm-hmm.

(BOTH CONTINUE SPEAKING FRENCH)

(COUPLE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Jacques.
Yeah?

I'm not French.

Yes, that is correct. Please.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)


(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Our dinner reservation is in
45 minutes. Can you be ready?

I'll meet you downstairs.
Okay.


<i>Bonsoir, madame.</i>
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hi!

MICHAEL: <i>I was thinking about you.</i>

Yeah, what were you thinking?

<i>About your sweet little ears.</i>


<i>So how's Paris?</i>

I'm actually not there yet.

<i>Why, what happened?</i>

wanted to stop for the night.

<i>He what?</i>


Look, he's not the greatest driver.

It's probably a good thing we're
not on the roads after dark.

<i>Yeah.</i> (LAUGHS)
<i>Hey, don't forget,</i>

<i>he's a Frenchman.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

How's Budapest?

<i>The hotel is great. It has an
amazing view of the Danube.</i>

<i>How are you feeling?</i>
Better.

Those ear drops are really helping.

<i>What ear drops?</i>

Michael, let's go on a real
vacation, just the two of us.

<i>Yeah, my phone not invited.</i>

<i>Honey, I think I'm getting
my back thing again.</i>

<i>Do you know where my pill pack is?</i>

It's in the pocket of your kit.

<i>I looked there.</i>

It's on the inside zip one.

<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

<i>You're the best.</i>

<i>Uh, what time do you think
you'll get to Paris tomorrow?</i>

Early afternoon, I guess.

<i>Okay. Call me when you
get there. Love you.</i>

All right. Love you, too.


(SPEAKS FRENCH)

I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

I'm sorry. What did he say?

He said, "You're very lucky to
be having dinner with Jacques."

ANNE: (LAUGHS) Oh.

The chef here was famous
for roast baby lamb.

What looks good to you, Anne?

Oh...

Everything looks good. I can't decide.

You don't have to.

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

I'm full already.
(CHUCKLES)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

The wines of the region
are Condrieu and Cote-Rotie.

We'll have them both.

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

(JAQCUES SPEAKS FRENCH)

(WAITER SPEAKING FRENCH)

This looks great!

JACQUES: Mmm.

Mmm.

So, Michael tells me you've
closed your dress shop.

Yes. My partner moved to
London with her husband.

I couldn't keep it open by myself.
Do you miss it?

I miss our customers and
all the pretty clothes.

But I'm ready to try something new.

What interests you now?

I notice you take a lot of pictures.

Oh. Those are just for fun.

I started taking photos
for our shop announcements.

JACQUES: Mmm-hmm.

And now I can't stop.

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

(JACQUES CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

Now.

(LAUGHS)
Eh?

Another one.
(LAUGHS) Oh.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

I did this with our daughter,
Alexandra, when she was little.

I remember her. She liked
to wear your red shoes.

You remember that?

Yeah.

I still have those shoes.
(CHUCKLES)

So when was the last time you wore them?

How old is she now?


She's 18.

Here's a picture of her high
school graduation. (CHUCKLES)

She's at U.C. Santa Barbara, now.

It's her second semester away from home.

JACQUES: She has lovely eyes...

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Like her mother.

Her mother is so used to juggling
work and taking care of her...

I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself.

But you have so much to offer.

It's a great time for you now.

It is?
Yes, of course.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

What makes you dance in the street?

You're beautiful. You're
an interesting woman.

Oh, come on.

I saw all the men in Cannes
drooling over those young girls.


You, you're chocolate creme brulee.

Yes, that's you. Brulee.


(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Oh, let me
introduce you to Anne.

This is Carole.
Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
Sorry for intruding.

I just heard that Jacques was here.

(BOTH CONTINUE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Enjoy your dinner.

Thank you.

I used to come here. I got to know Carole.

Yeah, that was clear.

She's the owner's niece.

Of course.
(CHUCKLES)

Why do flowers smell
so much better in France

than they do in the US?

Why? Because we're in France.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

In America they look lovely but
they smell like a refrigerator.

It's true.
Yeah.

Well...


Yes, but their scent mustn't
intrude on the aroma of the wine.

Ah.
(WAITER SPEAKS FRENCH)

Mmm-hmm.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Did you know that it was the Romans

who started winemaking in France?

I did not know that, my tour guide.



Mmm.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

Ooh, la, la?
(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

You'll see.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

So <i>dorade royale</i>
is what you call snapper.

Mmm-hmm.
It has little teeth like a baby

and it comes from the Atlantic.

Mmm.

Mmm. That's a pretty dress, Brulee.

Is it from your store?

Actually, it's French.
Oh.

Normally I have a passion for textiles.

And what else do you have a passion for?

Very expensive jewelry.

Ah.

Yeah, like that, uh, fancy
bracelet I see you wearing.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

That.

Actually this was given to
me by a chef in Barcelona.

We ate the best seafood in the
world. Fresh barnacles, giant crabs.

He wore it to remind himself
of his humble beginnings,

and how extraordinary it
is to be eating like we are.

I never take it off.

Are you trying to get
me drunk? That's naughty.

Just drink what you feel like.

(WAITER SPEAKING FRENCH)

The lamb and the veal are milk fed.

This is the best time of the
year to eat young animals.

Yes, well it's also the best
time to eat young carrots.

So, why have you never married?

I heard you had a girlfriend

and she was a marvelous chef and
she had her own little restaurant.

She sounded perfect for you.

(INHALES DEEPLY)


Well, what happened?

We were right for each other, but...

Unfortunately, there were circumstances.

Mmm-hmm.

Not all things are meant to be.

Yes, well, love isn't always fair.

Why is that?

It will never make sense to me.

ANNE: Jacques, I can't eat much more.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

JACQUES: <i>This cheese is made
from unpasteurized milk.</i>

<i>It's alive and very healthy.</i>

Your cheese in America
is pasteurized. It's dead.

It goes into your stomach
like a ball of fat.

Is that why you French people can eat

all the butter and cheese you want

and never gain weight?

Yes, and we drink more red wine.

Of course, we are more romantic.

Oh. Is that so?

So, Brulee, you know my vice, it's smoking.

Now you must confess yours.


(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, my gosh.

That is the last time I
ever tell you the truth.

Just taste.

Mmm.
Just eat what you feel like.

You know, unlike smoking,

there are studies that say
that chocolate is good for you.


You Americans always have to
have a reason for everything.

We eat what we enjoy.

Mmm. Mmm.

Michael called me just before
we came down for dinner.

He's worried about us here together.

Are you?

Should I be?

Well, I don't know.

In a long marriage, after
your child leaves home...

Are you happy?

Oh...

We have a good marriage...

No, that's not what I asked you.

Are you happy?

Well, sure.

Sometimes.
(CHUCKLES)

From Michael's call, I know
that he somehow mistrusts us.

Perhaps he mistrusts himself.

Is he faithful?

Oh, well, you probably know better than I.

He had quite a reputation and...

Well, we went through some hard times.

And have you made peace with your life?


I think it's a good question.

Have you made peace with yourself

and your marriage the way it is?

Ah...

Oh.
Don't worry, it's okay.

I'm such a klutz.


We French, we have a different
attitude about marriage

than you Americans.

Oh, and what is that?

We are practical.

We're loyal to family and to marriage...

But we are human, and we follow
our natural human passions.

Well, we must seem
boringly puritanical to you.

And guilty. Guilt is
bad for your digestion.

Well, how would you say
Michael's digestion is? (SCOFFS)

Well... (SIGHS) He's an attractive man,

and women do outrageous
things to get into movies.

Once, a wannabe starlet came
to our table at the beach.

Michael had taken off his shoes.

She picked one up, poured
champagne in it and toasted him.

Michael felt her desperation.

So, as he sent her away,

he gave her his rose gold Rolex.

He didn't have to do that.

I gave him that watch.

He told me he lost it.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

<i>Bonjour.</i>

(SNIFFS AND SIGHS)

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

(LINE RINGING)

SUZANNE: <i>Hey.</i>
Hi.

I didn't go.

My ears were killing me, so Jacques
offered to drive me to Paris.

<i>Excuse me? Jacques?</i>

<i>Michael let you go with
a man named "Jacques"?</i>


Suzanne, come on. Michael trusts me.

<i>You're driving across France with
Jacques, and you didn't call me?</i>

<i>When are you picking me up?</i>


He's a flirt. And he eats
too much and he smokes.

<i>So do I. We're perfect
for each other.</i>

<i>Is he adorable?</i>

Yeah. But I came on this trip
to spend some time with Michael.

<i>Yeah, and look where you are.</i>

<i>Seize the moment.</i>

<i>Just make sure he doesn't leave you</i>

<i>stranded along the road somewhere.</i>

Yeah, right.

<i>Gotta go.</i>
Bye.


Good morning, Brulee.

So, how are you feeling?

Much better, thank you.

My earache's nearly gone thanks
to those marvelous ear drops.

And the medicinal quality
of fine French wine.

Ha! No doubt.

And the hot chocolate was a
very nice touch, thank you.

I haven't had any hot
chocolate for breakfast

since I was at Girl Scout camp.

How did you sleep?

Oh, well.

I noticed you're not wearing any socks.

Oh, yes. You see everything.

I didn't pack any so I washed the ones

I was wearing, but they are not dry.

Well, I happen to have some of Michael's.

He left them at the hotel.

Would you like them?

Yeah.

Oh, well, why not. Thanks.

I know what it means to walk in
another man's shoes, but his socks?


(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

(KEYS JANGLING)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

I'd like to pay for my room last night.

Actually, I need your credit
card, if you don't mind.

Again?
Yes.

I discovered my envelope
of cash went back to Paris

with my assistant by mistake.

So I had to leave the charges of
our rooms and dinner on your card.

Okay.

You know, my name is
quite common in France,

and unfortunately, someone
using the same name has been

charging on false cards.

Until it is fixed, I have to use cash.

I have enough for gas and little
things, but not for hotel and dinner.

I will reimburse you as
soon as we get to Paris.

Right.

Okay.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

So I have good news.

My friend got us a
lunch reservation in Lyon

at the restaurant with a new chef
who's got outstanding reviews.

Jacques, that sounds wonderful,

but I thought we'd be in Paris by now.

Paris can wait.

We can't leave without
taking a look at the pyramid,

as they call it here.

Of course not.

(ANNE LAUGHS)

(CAR THUDS)
(ANNE GRUNTS)

Huh!

Two-thousand years ago this marked
the center of a Roman circus.

Can you feel the chariots racing

right here where we're standing?

That's so amazing!
Yeah.

Come.
Wait.

It's not really a
pyramid, but, it's more...

ANNE: Obelisk?
Yes.

Wow.

Birds live in here. (CHUCKLES)

ANNE: Do you play "I Spy"?

JACQUES: Sounds dangerous.

ANNE: It's a game I used to play
with Alexandra on road trips.

(COW MOOING)

I spy something with four legs.

I spy something with two lovely legs.

Come on.

Game over.

Not yet.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(EXASPERATED SIGH)

Where the hell have you been?
Oh!

A friend lives very nearby.
She has a garden full of roses.

Excuse me.

Please, come in.

Uh...

We'll have their perfume
until the rest of our trip.

ANNE: (CHUCKLES) Mmm.

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

Ready?

(SPEAKS ITALIAN)

(MUSIC PLAYING)

This is a perfect time to be
traveling through this region.

The Rhone River is nearby.

We can turn off and have a look.

Are we ever going to get to Paris?

Let's pretend we have a year to get there.

(SINGING IN FRENCH)

Most of the people don't realize

there are many delicious things to eat

growing right under their noses.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

Look, it's wild fennel.

Catch a trout, grill it on a bed of that,

and you have something really...

(LOUD BANG)

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

(JAQCUES EXCLAIMING)

JACQUES: (SIGHS) Oh, my God!

What?

I have no idea what's wrong. (CHUCKLES)


But look where we are, in
this beautiful countryside!

Let's have a picnic!

What?

Jacques, I need to get to
Paris, and we have a problem.

Our problem isn't going anywhere.

I brought a few things from the hotel.

Come on.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

Alex, honey,

is everything all right? It's
the middle of the night there.

ALEXANDRA: (DEJECTEDLY) <i>Mom.</i>

What, what's the matter?

<i>Noah is such a jerk!</i>

What? What, what, what?

<i>He finally asks me to hang out,</i>

<i>so, like, I meet him at Dugan's Pub,</i>

<i>and he brings his
two stoner roommates.</i>

Honey, he was probably just nervous.

Boys don't always know what
they're doing, not even big boys.

Sometimes you need to take the lead.

<i>That's so lame.</i>

May I remind you, this is
a great time in your life?

<i>Mom, I hear birds.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

one of your dad's business partners.

<i>Ugh. That sounds so boring.</i>

Oh, my God, you have no idea.

Look, I've been thinking about
your birthday. I have some ideas.

<i>Yeah? Okay.</i>

Alex called.

Is she okay?

Well, she will be.

It's about a boy.


but I try to slip her a
little advice when she lets me.

I have a feeling you have a lot of answers.

See? Wild watercress. I just found it.

Hmm.

Mmm. It's perfect, not hot and peppery

as it can get later in the season.

Taste it.

Oh, no.

Come on, try it.

Taste the wild flavor straight from nature.

It's good.

Ah. You see?

(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

JACQUES: Mmm.

ANNE: Look at that.
Yeah.

ANNE: And this one here.

So, you've just made a five-star picnic.

Mmm.

Wonderful.

Try this.

Oh, wait.

This is so beautiful.

Mmm.

Delicious.

But what about the car?

She'll wait for us to eat.

Try them all.

Mmm.

I don't need to try
everything to know what I like.


Mmm.

It's the first time I tried Sudoku.

I like it, but I got stuck.

Teach me your tricks.

You, um, look for triplets.


Yeah?

You can find it when
you see three in a row.


but I'm not sure I have
what it takes to finish them.

I think you do.

You know, let's pretend we
are in that Manet painting,

<i>Le dejeuner sur l'herbe.</i>

Oh.

Right.

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

See? The car is still waiting.

Now we have a problem.

Ah...

I don't think it's the radiator.

I wouldn't know.

Well, of course you wouldn't know.

There's nothing to eat under here.

Oh, my God.

ANNE: A-ha!

Fan belt!

Well, yeah.

Do you have your pocket knife?

Yeah.

All right, here. Hold this.

Turn around.

Turn around.

Once I saw a woman on YouTube doing this.

It looked simple at the time.

Here.

Take that side.

That one.
Okay.

Okay, cut it where your thumb is.

All right.

Right over left.

I hope I did that right.

(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

All right, you're gonna have to fit this

around where the fan belt goes.

The...
Try it.

Uh, where?

Well, it's gotta go under the thing.

Okay, okay, I can see.
Around the other side.

It's gotta go over the whole thing.

Now it's too loose.
(SIGHS)

I need your knife again.

All right, I think I got that right.

Maybe not.

Okay.

Try that.


All the way. Is it all the way?
Yeah.

It's okay. Let's see if actually it works.

(CAR ENGINE STALLING)

(ENGINE STARTS)

You American women are ingenious!

(BOTH LAUGH)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

What's he say?

He said, "You're a very clever woman."

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)


Now, let's pretend we're driving
straight to Paris in a car that works.

And we don't need another thing
to eat or drink for a month.

This car is designed to
make you lose your appetite.

Well, it has airbags.
And I can play my music.

I'm sure you know this
band. They're French.

Alex gave this to me. She saw
them play at the Hollywood Bowl.

Yes, it's Phoenix.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)


(SPEAKS ITALIAN)

Ha-ha!

Oh, I just hope my car
can rise from the ashes.

<i>â™ª Everything is everything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The more I talk about it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The less I do control â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything means everything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't understand a word â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Half of the stuff I'm sayin' â™ª</i>

JACQUES: Well, this is Lyon.

We are in the heart of France.

So how far are we from Paris? Be honest.

Not far. We have a stop first.

Well, this is L'Institut Lumiere,

and the two Lumiere
brothers, they lived here

when they invented cinematography.

The director is a friend of mine.

Jacques!

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Anne has come all the way from
America to see your museum.

Well.

Almost.

I'm Anne.

Martine.

Well, let's go, then.

(JACQUES SPEAKING FRENCH)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Anne, Martine and I
have business to discuss,

so, she organized a tour for you.

Oh.
Yeah.

Philippe will show you our museum.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Right this way, please.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

GUIDE: Then we'll move to this one.

This is, uh, the Cinematographe,

which is the very first camera.

It was invented by Louis
and Auguste Lumiere in 1895.

It is also a projector.

And then you have a model of
the first public projection.

And the Lumiere brothers, um,
thought their invention had no future.

Apparently they were wrong.
(CHUCKLES)

Well, that concludes our tour.

Thank you.

Um, I'm sorry, I have to go, but
you're free to visit the gift shop.

Have a nice day.
Thank you.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Hi.
Hi.

Martine is joining us for lunch.

Oh.

On the way I'll show you the
best market in all of France.

Oh...

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Sausage from here.
Mmm. Thank you.

Very good. It's the best one.
Mmm.

JACQUES: <i>And look, the
very best ingredients.</i>

<i>All the chefs come here.</i>

Wonderful!

You know that there used to
be worms in, uh, old cheese?

Worms? In the cheese?
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

So you had in the same
time cheese and the meat.

(BOTH LAUGH)

JACQUES: This family has been
selling cheese for over 200 years.

Look at <i>les fromages de
chevre.</i> This is goat cheese.

There is so many different kinds.

<i>My favorite is, uh,
Crottin de Chavignol.</i>

Anne.

(MARTINE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Thank you.

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

Be my guest.

(ANNE LAUGHS)

It's great, no?
BOTH WOMEN: Mmm.

No worms.
No worms.


(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Please.

It's tasty, no?

You know, they found fava
beans in the Egyptian tombs.

Hmm.

Jacques, remember those
divine fava beans we had

in that marvelous little place in Palermo?

Mmm.

Mmm. And in Sardinia, we had pureed favas

served with those delicious
wild bitter greens.

Hmm? Hmm.

It seems to me that the two of you

would like a chance to catch up.

And I'm not very hungry, so I
think I'm gonna take a little walk.

No, no.
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

Please, please, sit down.
No, you two catch up.

Absolutely not. You've got to
taste this food. Please, sit down.

All right.

(EXHALES SLOWLY)
JACQUES: Ah.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

Escargot.

Here, these are delicious.

Mmm. They've changed chefs,

but the snails are still good.

JACQUES: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

JACQUES: You must never
cook a dead snail, never.

They must always be cooked alive.

It's true.
It's a nightmare

how they kill snails.
(LAUGHS)

MARTINE: They put some salt
and get rid of all this bile.

JACQUES: You need to purge the
snails before you cook them.

They have to empty the intestines.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

This is a roasted cock from Bresse, yes?

And usually it has blue feet.
Ha!

This is the best in France.

Yes, and look...

They serve the breast first

and cook the legs a little
longer, to perfection.

And, oh, you have to eat it with rissoles,

potatoes fried in duck fat.

And this is morel, mushrooms.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Escargot!
(CHUCKLES)

That is a beautiful shawl,
Martine. Where did you get it?

It belonged to my Russian grandmother.

It's full of moth holes,
but I still love it.

Well, it's a beautiful
example of early-1900s paisley.

Well, if you're interested in fabrics,

there is an excellent textile
museum a few blocks away.

You should go and see it.
Don't you think so, Jacques?

No, no, please, we're going to Paris.

Please don't give him any ideas.

Jacques, this has to be our last stop.

Okay?
JACQUES: All right.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh.

(MARTINE AND JACQUES TALKING IN FRENCH)

ANNE: Hey!

Look at this exquisite embroidery
from the 18th century! Huh.

Can you believe it was all done by a man?

Of course it was.

Come see his picture.

Here he is!

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

(MARTINE SPEAKS FRENCH)

JACQUES: Mm-hmm.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Oh, I'm sorry.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

I'm sorry. Oh.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

because I think you knew.

Well, I've got to go back to work.

Anne, don't be in a
hurry to go back to Paris.

You'll never forget your
travels with Jacques.

Trust me.


(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

(MARTINE CHUCKLES)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

(DOOR CLOSES)

That was a very touching goodbye.

Yeah.

MARTINE: Ooh.

I told her to get a pair
of sensible shoes. Hmm.

Of course you did.

Okay, Jacques. I've had enough detours.

It's straight to Paris now, right?

(JACQUES SIGHS)

Let's hear more of your music.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>â™ª Fences in a row â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fences in a... â™ª</i>

(DOOR CLOSES)

(ENGINE STARTS)

(POP ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

(SOOTHING CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

When I see the first new moon,

faint in the twilight...

I think of the moth eyebrows

of a girl I saw only once.

A haiku.

Nice.

The changing of the moon reminds me that

life and business have cycles.

JACQUES: Sometimes full, and sometimes not.

Hmm. You seem to live
as if it's always full.


Anne, I have to tell you that...

ANNE: Look! Vezelay!

Did you see the sign?


I had no idea we were so close.

Let's make a little detour and
see the beautiful cathedral there.

Who are you?

And what have you done
with my American friend

always in a hurry to get to Paris?

Don't I get a turn to choose a stop?

It's straight to Paris.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

ANNE: <i>Richard the Lionhearted
began the Third Crusade from here.</i>

(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

ANNE: (WHISPERING) They say there are

bones of Mary Magdalene under the altar.

<i>See those columns?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

ANNE: <i>Each one tells a story.</i>

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(ANNE CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

You can tell me your sadness, Anne.

It happened a long time ago.

But it's still with you.

Yes. And it always will be.

David.

He had a heart defect,
and he lived only 39 days.

He was always surrounded by
nurses and doctors, but...

He knew me.

He held onto my finger...

And fought so hard
every minute of his life.


I'm so sorry.


His father, my first husband...

He couldn't handle it, he left.

One day, I wandered into a church...

And there was an alcove

with the Virgin Mary
holding her infant son.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

And suddenly I felt connected...

To all the mothers who have
lost a child down through time.

I wear this to remind me

how fragile life is,

and how painful and
exquisite it is to be alive.

Anne, you're human.

And you've been to the
depths of what that means.

(JACQUES SPEAKING FRENCH)

Food is good for the soul.

This place is supposed
to be the best in Vezelay.

Great.
Please.

Jacques, I need to make a phone call.
Okay. Of course.

VOICEMAIL: <i>This is the
voicemail box for...</i>

MICHAEL: <i>Michael Lockwood.</i>

VOICEMAIL: <i>Please leave a message.</i>

Hey, honey, it's me.

I just miss you...

VOICEMAIL: <i>The mailbox is full and
cannot accept any messages at this...</i>



(SPEAKING FRENCH)

JACQUES: Yes, of course.

Uh, listen, I need an advance. Yeah.

Come on, you know our new picture
will be a big hit in the UK.

No, I need the money now, damn it!

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

You'll drink for both of us.

We still have a long drive.

It's a Cuvee Silex, from
Domaine Daguenau 2012.

Of course.

<i>Merci.</i>

It has a crisp mineral note
that expresses, uh, the terroir.

And the vineyard subsoil
is calcareous chalk.

It's giving something
really special for this wine.

Because it's very deep and, uh...

I am boring you.

No. No, no.

I mean, yes.


It's just a little intimidating,
how much you know about wine.

It's just knowing what you like.

My happiest memories are around the table.

And I'm here now with you.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT)

What's wrong?

It's Alex. She's decided to go
camping with friends for her birthday.

It'll be the first birthday in
her life that I won't be with her.

You've taught her how
to be happy on her own.

Now it's your turn. And you're in Burgundy.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)


<i>Merci.</i>


No, it's good, but who needs this fuss?

I remember going into the garden

with my mother and picking tomatoes...

Really ripe, red ones in August.

Bringing them into the kitchen,

still warm from the sun.

She'd put slices on fresh bread,

add good olive oil, sea salt
and fresh ground pepper and say,

"Jacques, you'll never eat better."

She was right.

The best food in the world
is straight from the garden

with very little done to
it. Authentic, like you.


So, what did your family eat, Anne?

I grew up in Cleveland. (LAUGHS)

Nobody's perfect. (CHUCKLES)

No, our idea of fine
dining was fried chicken,

mashed potatoes, and frozen peas.

I didn't learn about good food
until I went to California.

There is one thing from my
past that I make well, though.

Lemon meringue pie.

Mmm, great.

Sometimes I think Michael
married me for my pie. (CHUCKLES)

He married you for much more than your pie.

(WAITER SPEAKING FRENCH)

JACQUES: <i>Merci.</i>

This butter from Brittany is
the best we have in France.

Now, there is a trip we should take.

The coastline, the oysters, the cider,
and <i>les galettes bretonnes...</i>

Those wide and thin
buckwheat pancakes. Mmm.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(CHUCKLES) I love pancakes.

Excuse me.

Thank you.

Michael!
MICHAEL: <i>Everything okay?</i>

Yeah, I was just checking
in to see what's...

<i>I think I'm over this
whole producing thing.</i>

<i>Once Alex is out of school,</i>

<i>let's talk about Plan B.</i>

Oh.

<i>Honey, there are problems
on the Morocco shoot.</i>

<i>I have to go there ASAP with
a big fire extinguisher.</i>

Huh. Well, when would
that put you in Paris?

<i>I can hardly hear
you. Where are you?</i>

I'm in a restaurant.

<i>With Jacques?</i>

Well, yeah.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

<i>Listen, Anne.</i>

<i>Jacques can be very charming,</i>

<i>and Frenchmen have no scruples
when it comes to married women.</i>

I'll keep that in mind.

<i>Call me as soon as you
get to the apartment.</i>

<i>Love you.</i>

Love you, too.


Hmm.

JACQUES: "Nipples of Venus."

It's their specialty.

JACQUES: <i>Merci.</i>

Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

Oh, my goodness.


You've been taking a lot of photos.

Let me see what you've got there.

Oh, they're nothing, really.

Come on. Show me.

You have a beautiful eye for detail.

They are very evocative.

You think?

Yeah. You don't show the whole thing.

You make me imagine the complete picture.

Do you make prints?

No.
(DISTANT CHEERING)

Although I've thought of making

some large prints of a few images.

Hmm.

What does Michael think of your photos?

I haven't really shown him.

Why not?

I don't think he sees me as a photographer.

I mean, he asks to see them,
but I think he's just being nice.

Michael is a nice guy.

Why are you not revealing yourself

to the man you've been with for 20 years?

See?

How beautiful you are.

(LOUD CHEERING IN THE BACKGROUND)

It's a wedding.

(ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYING)

I like this music.
Yeah?

Oh.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

ANNE: Oh...

Let's pretend we are in that Renoir
painting, <i>Danse a Bougival.</i>

JACQUES: <i>Yeah?</i>

ANNE: <i>Okay.</i> (LAUGHS)

(BOTH LAUGH)

Okay.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)

(ALL SPEAKING FRENCH)

Your very own Sudoku book.

Mmm. Thank you.

Some chewing gum.

It's better for you than smoking.
Yeah.

You seem to really like kids.

Do you ever wish you'd had your own?

Well, I have a nephew, Jean-Louis.

Oh.
He's like my son.

He was two when my brother died.


I'm sorry.

He thinks it was an accident.

He doesn't know his
father's death was suicide.


I kept it secret.

I never told anyone.

My brother and I had a company together.

I didn't see it coming.

Oh, that's so painful.

I'm sorry.

How lucky his son is to have you.

I'm lucky, too.

So, Brulee, now, tell me,

what was the happiest moment in your life?

When Alexandra was born
and the doctor said,

"You have a healthy baby girl."

(JACQUES CHUCKLES)

For me it was, uh...

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

Playing tag with my brother in the garden

while my mother picked
vegetables for dinner.


JACQUES: <i>So tell me, Brulee,
where are you staying in Paris?</i>

ANNE: <i>Our friends have an apartment.</i>

<i>We like to stay there
when they're away.</i>

So this is your friends' apartment?

(ANNE SIGHS)


how much this trip has meant to...

For me, too.

Hmm.

The way our friend taught us
the code, I'll never forget.

"A" "52"-year-old
woman

can "B"

with a "38"-year-old guy.
(CHUCKLES)

Of course.

JACQUES: Where is your apartment?

It's on what you call the third floor.
Oh.

There's an elevator.


But it's... Well, you'll see. It's French.

(CHUCKLES)
ANNE: It's really tiny.

(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

Thank you.

(ANNE BREATHING HEAVILY)

So, I promised I'd return you to Paris

without so much as holding your hand.

And I did it.

Who did you promise?

Me.

Your roses, <i>madame.</i>

(SPEAKS FRENCH)


Let's not pretend anymore.

I never was.

You opened something in me.

to feeling like this.

Me either.

Jacques.
What?

You really must go.


Anne, we both know better
than to miss this moment.

We haven't missed it.

I leave for London today, but I
will be in San Francisco on the 15th.

I'll save you a seat at the bar

at Swan's Oyster Depot at 1:00 p.m.


Bring some prints of your photos.

Oh, Jacques.

Yes. We'll drive up the coast, and...

The food won't be as good as Brittany, but

what does it matter,

when you're on the road with Brulee?

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

Oh...

<i>Bonjour,</i> Anne.
