Nah, l got to make some runs today.

How you doing, Ms. Ann?
Hey, baby.

You see that blue car up the street?

Yeah, they still up there.

Goddamn Feds been messin'
with me all morning.

Bitch can't make
a decent dollar nowadays.

You wonder why?
Y'all need to slow down.

You know what l mean?

Women your age should be
thinking about menopause.

Y'all been slinging crack
since the '60s, Momma.

Boy, don't ever let me see
you fix your mouth to say that.

Me and Ms. Ann
been slinging since the 'GOs.

Double-ups, half ounces,
ounces, grams, kilos,

burrs, chickens, eagles,
bricks, boulders,

cake, weight, hard, soft.

However you want it, nigger.

Fish scales! Whatever.

Just hit me on my Blackberry.

See? Y'all getting too old
for this shit.

What do you want?
You fixing to get on my nerves.

You breaking my concentration.

Y'all know tonight's the night,
right?

No. To do what?

I do that big show over
at the Mercy Theatre tonight.

Well, what do you do?

l'm a promoter, Momma.

Me and Jellyroll, we been doing
this for, like, four years now.

Well, you must not be any good.
Why we ain't heard about the show?

'Cause y'all are too old
to be worried about hip-hop.

Y'all need to be worried about
when Al Green coming to town.

Well, can l tell you no
right now before you ask,

'cause l know what you want.

Come on, Momma. Look.

All l need is a one-day loan,
the kind you be giving out.

How short are you?

Now, l got to pay for the building,

l got to get the hotels,

and, you know, these rappers
be having all kind of requests,

so, you know,
we about 9500 in the hole.

Ninety-five hundred!

Why don't you spend your Aruba money
instead of wasting it on Aruba?

Now, you know
i cannot spend that money.

That's my wedding money, okay?

lf l spend the Aruba money,
ain't no reason to go to Aruba,

'cause Loli ain't gonna
marry me anyway.

What's wrong with being single?

I ain't never been married,
and I'm cool.

Momma, you got to stop hating
on my relationship.

You sound like a bitch.

No! The answer is no.

Me and Ms. Ann got
to re-up tonight, Mr. Promoter,

so think of a new one.

Just because l told you
your daddy might be Don King

don't mean you gotta be running around
acting like you some damn promoter.

Well, maybe it's just in my blood.

Yeah, well, whatever.

See you at church tomorrow.

See y'all at church.

Hey, baby.
Drive!

What's the matter?
Drive, man!

What's going on?
Would you drive?

It's going down around here.

What's the matter?

Oh, man, that nigger Ronnie Stixx
tried to kill me again.

You fucking all on his wife, man.

But not all the time.
Every now and then I'm hitting it.

Still hitting that.
What's happening?

I'm gonna need half
of your money by show time,

or at least by sound check, man.

This building owner is on my ass.

Every five minutes he calling me
about that money.

Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

You got your half?
I got my half.

Cool, cool.
When you gonna have yours?

After I go pick them up from the hotel,
I'm gonna have my half.

What the ticket sales looking like?

Ticket sales ain't doing too good.

What?
Shit, we in Modesto.

Everybody know
this is a walk-up town.

This is a word-of-mouth town.

Word of mouth
you know what I mean?

That's just how the town is.
This is Modesto, man.

Hey, now.

Come on, girl.
Baby, it's hot. Come on.

Right now?

Yeah, I gotta blow up

Baby, it's only a couple.

Come on.

Hold on, tiger.

Oh, yeah, baby.

Damn!

Yeah!

How's everything?

I finally got them down here.

This a no-star hotel.

Ooh, is that him?

I think that's Jeezy right

I think I can see
the tattoo on his neck.

Double-R Incorporated.
Russell Redds.

What's this bullshit, Russell?

What you mean?

We supposed to get
a five-star hotel,

like the Hyatt Regency,
Doubletree, something classy.

l can't even get dude
out the van.

l know that. l know you all
were supposed to be over at the Hyatt,

but when l called
they was all sold out,

and over at that Doubletree,
they got that police--

They got some kind
of police convention.

Retirement party.
You don't wanna go there.

l know y'all be doing your thing
and don't wanna be over there.

This right here, the Cloud G,
is actually one of the best hotels...

BOTH: ...in Modesto.

Me and Jellyroll stay here
all the time.

I got married here, man.

And we got you that discount rate
l was talking about.

Yeah, 'cause Martin Luther King
probably got shot here.

You know what, a nigger
named King Luther got shot

up there in 313 one night.

Some shit jumped out,
got real ugly...

You know what, man?
I'm calling the Hyatt.

You're wasting your time.
MICHELLE: I think that's him.

I wanna let him beat on this box.

Ooh, shit!

I like that little one right there.

With the big old booty?
I guess, if that's what you like.

They're overpriced,

and they didn't have
the presidential suite you asked for.

You saying they have my suite?

No, they didn't have your suite.
They got it over here.

They got the Jacuzzi...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

We'll talk about that later, okay?

What we need to do is get the keys...
Gonna get the keys--

We're gonna get the keys,
and l get him to his room,

'cause he's tired, you know.
Do what you're gonna do, man.

Shut the fuck up.
I'm talking to Russell.

This nigger think l'm the driver?

Make sure I get
that presidential suite ASAP.

I'll get you the presidential suite.
With a Jacuzzi?

I hooked you up.
That's what's up.

Help me with the bags, please.

That nigger act like he got

The road managers,

You ovulating?
Yes, I am!

Girl, me too, girl.
We gonna get paid.

Now, fix your titties.
Yeah, let's do this.

Hell, no, man.

Fuck!

Oh, be having bottles!

Shit.

Thank you, Jeezy, for going platinum.

Let me call the man.

<i>It's crazy in here.

Yeah, dreadful.

<i>- Let's go to sound check.

Don't trip, man. My shit whack too.
Let's go to the ventte,

Aw, yeah.

Wanna go to the room?

Ha! Yeah. Sweet.

Yeah, that's how we do it.

I spent a grip over at Gino's
on the way here.

You need to go to the mall.

You're probably gonna wear
that ugly-ass Kurt Franklin suit.

They threw my son's CD
out the window?

Slung that out the window
like a Frisbee.

I thought a dog was gonna
catch it.

Catch that motherfucker
in the air.

But, no, I was mad too,
but don't worry about the CD.

This is what you need to
worry about.

Huh! Two Gs. Gator!

That's them preachers be tricking
them bitches in church with.

That's something special.
That ain't shit.

That ain't shit.

You need to look at 13 Gs.

I'm gonna kill 'em tonight, baby.
I'm-a kill-- whoo!

Damn! That's the showstopper,
right there.

Precision.

You need to get
your shit together.

I need to get my shit together?
Yeah.

I'm the one who taught
you the game, boy.

You might be able to out-dress me,
but never to out-think me.

Understand that, now.

I don't know where
you borrowed that money from,

but i don't want no bullshit
at the venue tonight.

I come from money.
I've had money all my life.

Looky here, man. Whoever you
borrowed that money from

gonna be bugging the shit
outta me to get paid.

What's up, Russell?
You taking us to sound check?

Yeah, let's go.

All right, man, get your driver.

Driver? You better be in a car seat
when you get in that van,

little Gary Coleman-looking
motherfucker.

Clean that good, girl.

Y'all got that?

Mike check one, mike check mo.

Russell Redds.

Oh, goddamn.
Just the guy l wanted to see.

Where's my money?

Man, l got your little
funky-ass $G500.

9500. Don't get cute with me.
Whatever, man.

I'll meet your greedy ass
in the office.

Trying to handle this
goddamn show.

No cash, the house
doesn't open, all right?

Gonna take a whipping tonight,
boy!

Whatever, man.
You're going down, baby.

Yeah, your daddy want
his hat back.

Motherfucker.

JELLYROLL: ...on the seats.
You understand me?

Do you feel me? Do you feel me?

Look, Jeezy,
just give me a second.

Bring my Hennessey back.

I got you covered.

Damn! About to lose my job.

Man, how you not gonna have
no Popeye's chicken,

no potato salad, no Hennessey?

If it's a rap show,
you gotta have Hennessey, man!

Who are these goddamn promoters?

Don't they know l've been
working with the best of them?

I can't pay all of them.
I'll pay your light bill.

At least you'll have--
Jellyroll!

All right, i'm gonna holler
at you in a minute.

Up top, baby.

See you later.

I need to holla at you.
What's up?

Hey, brother,
i need to talk to you, man.

What's up?
Wait a minute!

Russ, what you need, man?

Hold on, Jellyroll.
Let me hear what he got to say.

Hold up, Russell. I think your
partner got a problem with me.

Yeah, you thinkin' right.

He the one that threw
your son's CD out the window.

What?
Him. Don't lie.

Are you lying to me?
What happened was--

When we was in the car, and--
You lying.

You look like a lying motherfucker.
What you want?

I don't know what's happening here,

but i'm focused on what we need,

and that's that Hennessey
in the dressing room ASAP.

Get the fuck outta here.

Can't you see us having
this conversation about the show?

You talkin' about some Hennessey?
Liquor, man? What the fuck--

I'll talk to you in a minute.

Scram.

You know what? Fuck it.
No Hennessey, no show.

Ain't got time for this shit.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, that's what Jeezy said.

You know, i mean,
i'm just the messenger.

If i was the rapper, I'd say,
"Can we have a Hennessey, please,"

'cause that's what's on the rider.

You tell that motherfucker Jeezy
that we'll think about it.

Yeah.

Okay, thanks.

Hey, Percy.
What?

Don't forget where you at, man.

You in M-Do now.

The 2O9, punk.

What's that supposed to mean?

Look, i'm about to go pay Glanville.

I need you to steal
that money back, okay?

All right, look,
here's what we gonna do.

Count this shit faster, man.

Hey, you know what?

Let me take my time here,
all right?

Jeez.

Five... 9,OOO.

Have a seat, Russell.

I'd rather stand.

Whatever you want, bro,
but you don't look too good.

Forgot to bring my medicine.

You know l'm a diabetic, right?
No, l didn't know that,

but l do know that you suck
at being a promoter.

I don't want to hurt
your feelings or nothing.

You're not gonna make it.
It's not gonna happen.

Look, man, some
of our shows worked.

Give us some credit.

But most of your shows
do not make money,

because you and Jelly Rat
don't know what you're doing.

Jellyroll.
Jellyroll, whatever.

What the hell's wrong with you,
man?

You all right, brother?

We have to call my woman.

She got to-- !

Hey. Hey, Russell! Russell!

Russell! Russell. Russell.

Russell, what's up, man?

It's me, Johnny-- hey!

I need help here!
I need-- Russell, hey!

That's what he'll usually use.

A Capri Sun? What the fuck?

Russell Redds! Wake up, Russ.

See if she'll come pick him up.
We gotta go, man.

Hold it a second!

What the hell happened
to my money?

What money?

Pat 'em down, boys.

Don't touch me.

I don't know where that
come from.

You're goddamn geniuses, huh?

The only reason you mo
are walking out of here alive

is because the show must go on.

Because if it doesn't
and those monkeys in there

<i>ruin my beautiful theatre,
ay, mamacita.</i>

Just give 'em a little bit
of appetizer.

What's appetizer?

Come on, man! Motherfucker!

Shit!

Damn!
Goddamn.

I knew that bullshit
wasn't gonna work, man!

It would've worked if you'd
just came and got the money

instead of trying
to get me off the ground.

<i>What do you think you are,
Gray's Anatomy?</i>

l didn't know your ass was
gonna be stretched out on the floor.

Just have your half tonight.
Shit, l'm broke.

Look, Jellyroll, it's imperative
you don't spend that money.

This show gotta jump off, man.

Our life might depend on it.

Shit.

Hit me in my motherfucking jaw.

I ain't gonna be able to eat no pussy
for mo, three months now.

I'm gonna have to eat me
some pussy like this.

Turn-down service.
Come back later.

Ooh, l'll love the shit outta you.

Babe, you gotta get up outta here.

Let's go.
Ooh, baby.

No, no, no!
Finally got a real rapper.

What the fuck? Let go of me.
Hey, man, stop.

Hold on, baby, i don't fuck

Okay, okay. l'll give you some.
I don't fuck around like that.

Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

You gotta go, baby. I got a show.

Oh, l got a show tonight for you.

Oh, i'm sorry! Is that your balls?
Let me kiss them.

Come, man, don't fight it.

You allergic to pussy?

I told you to stop. Get off me!

Oh, thank God you came.

Let's go to security.

You are an animal!

Wait a minute.

Ow, that burns!

No, wait, you don't understand.
She lying.

This is some bullshit.
She lying on me, man.

I'm telling you,

Nothing.

Miss Leonard caught us fucking

I didn't want to lose my job, so...
You didn't!

PERCY: Call my lawyer!
You know l did.

Yo, Jeezy! Call my lawyer, man.

You know you lying.

I'm about to go finish my shift.

Excuse me, ma'am. You're gonna

For what?

We have to run

This nigger Percy, he's crazy.

For real, he didn't learn

Peace out.
Don't eat the baloney sandwich, nig.

We'll be down there

Right about now,

Make some noise for Yung Semore!

And the crowd goes crazy.

You look good.

Nigger, you ain't even look at me!

RONNIE: Till death do us part,
Geeny.

Till death do us part.

Show time!

Russell Redds.
What up, man?

Where the fuck is Jellyroll?

I don't know.
Shit, i ain't seen him.

I don't see his car
so he might not be here' yet.

Y'all need some tickets?

Yeah.
Okay, l'll hook you up.

He was supposed to leave us
some at the front desk.

What's up with that?
It happened like that.

He ain't here.
I'll hook y'all up.

I want to know
what the fuck is going on,

'cause l got some money
invested in the concert.

Wait, what did you say?
Twenty Gs.

You gave Jellyroll 20 Gs?

Yeah, for Jeezy to show up
to my after party.

That's up.

Oh, man, i ain't seen him all day.

Didn't you send Jellyroll to
my house to cop some weed?

I don't recall that.
Well, recall this.

That's when l gave
his ass the money.

Okay.

Now go see about
my backstage pass.

Wait a minute, you said
you wanted tickets.

Now i want backstage passes,
since i'm a partner.

We partners, dog.

You see that i'm short, man.
It's thin out here.

How many you need?
Twenty-seven.

Wait here!
Hurry up.

Hey, hey, anybody seen Jellyroll?

<i>What up, bitches? It's your boy Percy.

Everybody better have a pass.

Free tickets for every goddamn
body up in this building.

Hey, Nick, get your big ass
out the way.

Where you think you going?

I'm Russell Redds, the promoter.
That's my son in there!

That may be true, but you can't
enter until he says it's okay.

So wait here.

I know your uncle too!

Yo!

He's getting a massage.
What you want?

Dollar, it's me.
Hey, yo, Semore!

Your pop's out here.

Yo, Russell, there's this guy
standing out there named Mondo.

Don't let him in, all right?
Just tell him l'm working on it.

Thanks.

Thank you.

Gotta pat you down first.

Are you serious?

That motherfucker ain't

Semore! Hey, man,

What the hell's going
on around here?

What you mean what's going on?
These are all my people.

We kicking it. It's show time.

You got bodyguards, entourage.
There's strippers in there.

There's motherfuckers that didn't pay.
That's coming out your money.

You getting a massage?
What's going on!

Don't worry about nothing, Pops.

I heard that Puffy,
Jay-Z, and Andre 3,OOO

get at least four
or five massages a week.

That's just how us rappers do.

Are you crazy? Nigger, they rich!
They got money.

You ain't got nothing.

I got talent.
That's all the money l need.

Are you high?
No, i ain't high.

Havee you been drinking?
No.

Look here, man, don't play
with me with that talent shit.

I done told you already,
talent don't make money.

Money make money.

I got you.
Okay?

All right, man,
but forget about that.

Look here, man,
how many songs can you do?

I got six albums' worth
of rhymes. Why?

I need you to go on there
and do more than 20 minutes.

I got it. I can go all night
if you need me to, just like Kanye.

Look, i'm Yung Semore,
the crowd wanna see more,

and they fiendin' for it,
i'm-a let 'em see more!

Hey, yo, Big D.
Can you escort my dad outta here?

You don't let nobody in here
without my approval.

Nigga, nobody want to listen to me.
They'll learn. I'll start firing people.

I still don't understand why we
had to park so far down the street.

'Cause i'm the promoter.

I don't want nobody to see me
pulling up in that Rent-a-Van.

Ooh, Regina...

I'm Jellyroll Entertainment,

<i>and you looking like one of the
girls off The Flava of Love,</i>

RONNIE: We gonna settle
this right now.

It's your husband!

Get down.

Come on, girl, run!

REGINA: I'm running. I'm running!

RONNIE: Regina, l love you, baby.

It's me. Oh, yeah, it's me.

REGINA: Don't kill him! I'm sorry!

Oh, baby, come back! Please!

I just want to cuddle. Come on!

Come back! Stop!

Going down. Yung Semore's
in the building.

I'm feeling good, i'm looking good,
and i'm smelling wonderful.

RAPPER 1 : Yo, all right!

RAPPER 2: Tear it up.
You ready, man?

I don't know, Dad, man.

I don't think l'm ready.

All them people out there,
i don't know if they're feeling me.

What happened to all that swagger
you had in the dressing room?

I learned that from 50 Cent.

Look, man, you can
name every rapper

and what they had for breakfast,
but what about you?

Man, you can't be no regurgitated MC!

You got to be an original.

The people, they want
an original, all right?

Now, you Yung Semore, right?
Modesto's finest, right?

Well, then act like it.

I'm-a go out there and announce
that Yung Semore's in the house

and he about to tear
this motherfucker up, right?

Right.
Right?

You ready?
I'm ready.

Stop acting like a bitch
and come on. Hit it.

Ready on the curtain and a spot.

All right, remember what i told you?
Clap, clap, clap.

Hey, now. Yo, yo.
What's up, Modesto!

How y'all doing?

Not this nigger again.

Are you all ready to see
Young Jeezy?

Yeah, before we bring out Jeezy,

i'd like to say that this show
was brought to you

by Russell Redds, Incorporated,

in conjunction with
Jellyroll Entertainment,

and you know we bring
the finest show--

Fuck that!
Hey, man, be nice.

None of that bullshit, Modesto.

Don't embarrass me up here, now.
Don't embarrass me.

Before we bring out Young Jeezy,
i got a treat for you all.

Y'all know who he is.

Y'all done seen him since he
was yea high to a horsefly.

He better than Jay-Z,
he better than Little Wang

and Kanye West put together.

Y'all give it up for my son,
Yung Semore!

Give it up! Give it up!

Uh, let's go.

Jeezy down in the building.

What's happening, Modesto?

I go by the name of Yung Semore.

Make some noise for me. Yeah!

We're gonna do it like this.

How's everything going?

How the fuck you think, man?

Where you been?
Where the group?

I went up to the hotel.
They wasn't there.

Did you call?

I called up there.
I ain't get no answer.

Fuck it. Come on.

Hey, Percy, man, our reputation
in Modesto is in jeopardy as of now.

Okay, call me back, brother,
please.

Please, brother, please.
Call me back, brother, please.

Damn, why you didn't call me?

Man, Regina's trifling ass
came over there

and put it on me and had me
in the bed for about an hour.

Shit.

Okay, what time did you
get to the hotel?

I got there about 9:OO, 9:30.

Look, i already see
where you're trying to go.

It ain't my fault.
It is your fault.

I don't know how,
but l know it's your fault.

Don't start.
Why you bring Mondo into--?

Mondo wanted to invest
with Jellyroll Entertainment.

Mondo?
You just mad 'cause i got investors

and you ain't got none,
going on with all that.

Twenty Gs, dog?
You don't need 20 Gs!

Don't worry about the internal affairs
of Jellyroll Entertainment.

Like i said, all you need to worry
about is that Aruba money.

Stay out of my goddamn business.

Can i ask you just one thing,
FYI, okay, for your information,

or just for my information.
Come on with it.

How the hell you gonna get Jeezy
to show up at some after party

if he won't even show up
to our show?

You just stay out of my business.

Just worry about that Aruba money.

Your business is my business!
Remember that!

Yeah, Yung Semore
in the building, baby.

No passes?

Dirty motherfuckers.

Bitch, how much for 2T tickets?

Don't do this, Percy.
We got the people out here.

They waiting for Jeezy.
There ain't no Jeezy, man.

Call me back, man.
I'd really appreciate it, man.

It's Russell Redds.
Call me back, brother, please.

Please, brother, please.
Thank you.

I fucked up, huh?

Yeah, you did.
That ain't business, man.

You should've handled business.

I know, i know.

That ain't business.
I know.

Damn, man.

Oh, there they are.

Hey, Jeezy, baby! Hot damn!

Look, man, you scared
the hell out of us.

Where you been?
Where Percy at?

Had a little situation
with my road manager, man.

Hey, man, fuck all that.

You were supposed to be on stage
about an hour ago.

You're very unprofessional.

Unprofessional? I'm here now,
nigger.

Gentlemen, we don't need that.
How much time you need?

Ten minutes. Hey, but where
the rest of that paper at?

Oh, now, look, man.
You secure now.

We got your dough.
We ain't no small-time dudes.

Okay.
We've been doing this a while.

We got your money.
You secure on that.

But i wanted to talk to Percy
because earlier, at sound check,

he promised me and Jellyroll
that we probably could get

a slight discount
if the house wasn't that full.

Now, look, we got a 3500-seater.

Now, it's only about 52T.

Something like that,
ballpark figure.

So i was just wondering
if that little discount still rang true.

You saying that to say what?

I'm saying that, you know,
you got all these platinum plaques.

I thought you was bigger than that.
I thought you could fill the house.

I am bigger than that. Maybe
y'all should be better promoters.

And you're saying that to say what?

I'm saying it to say
I want my fucking money.

Let's roll, man.

We got your money.
That ain't shit.

Little old chump change.

Man, you ain't got to be
all hostile like that.

You have a nice show.

Yeah, have a nice show, brother.

You need to freeze some of that
meat on the back of your head.

Get off the stage!

SEMORE: Somebody say yeah.

You see the look on that
motherfucker's face when i told him?

"l thought you
was bigger than that."

No, did you see
the look on your face

when he said that you was
a sorry-ass promoter?

You looked stupid
as a motherfucker.

Just give me the money
so we can pay these clowns.

I-i-i tried to tell you
when i pulled up, man.

I tried to tell you
when i pulled up.

Regina's husband tried
to run us over, man.

What's that got to do
with the money?

Look, i tried to offset it,

'cause I thought we was gonna
have a walk-up crowd.

You started yelling at me,
and then i messed up money.

Come on through.
What that got to do with anything?

What that got to do, man?
Look, look, look, don't tell me.

Don't tell me. Jellyroll,
do you have this man's money?

No, i don't have the money,
but...

This watch.
