I don't expect anything.

Just to go a little

I like it.

Do you have any children?
I have a daughter.

She's 10.

<i>( baby cries )</i>
<i>- I bet it's hard</i>

Being a single mom.
I know my daughter's
a little younger,

But it would be fun for them
to get together, maybe.

It's kind of a hard age

Remedial work?

We're looking to make sure

( man mutters )
I got stuff on my house.

Kids acting strange.

Sometimes we see tar

Coming out in the cracks
in the patio.

The neighbors here,
they had their house
in escrow.

They pulled out.

The buyers pulled out.

<i>Yeah.</i>

That's too bad.

The reports
from the lab came in.

It showed the presence
of lead and cadmium

<i>In the surface soil</i>

We need to leave.

Both of us.
( shushes )

There's something
missing.

<i>( distant kids playing )</i>

<i>( man, in english )</i>
<i>there is a love...</i>
<i>- ( grunts )</i>

<i>...That is like a stream</i>
<i>that goes dry</i>

<i>When rain</i>
<i>no longer feeds it.</i>

<i>But there is a love...</i>
<i>- ( baby fussing )</i>

<i>...That is like a spring</i>
<i>coming up from the earth.</i>

<i>The first is human love,</i>
<i>the second is divine love</i>

And has its source above.

The husband is
to love his wife

As christ loved the church,

And give his life for her.

<i>He does not</i> find <i>her lovely--</i>
<i>he</i> makes <i>her lovely.</i>

<i>But there is a grace that</i>
<i>comes in such a marriage.</i>

<i>( marina, in english )</i>
<i>I got married when I was 17.</i>

And I had a child.

But my husband

Started running
after other women.

And he left us

And went
to canary islands.

<i>And other priests have</i>
<i>told me that</i>

<i>In the eyes of the church</i>
<i>I'm still married to that man.</i>

<i>They said I couldn't</i>
<i>have the sacraments.</i>

<i>I want to be a wife.</i>

( clinks )
<i>( girl speaking )</i>

<i>I don't even know why I was</i>
<i>with him in the first place.</i>

<i>Then it sunk in.</i>

I didn't really want
to tell my dad

Because I knew
he would start yelling.

( continues speaking )
<i>( distant siren blaring )</i>

Girl:
<i>I'd never give her up.</i>

<i>Ever.</i>

<i>( distant chattering )</i>

<i>( priest, in spanish )</i>
<i>everywhere you're present.</i>

<i>And still I can't see you.</i>

<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

<i>You're within me.</i>

<i>Around me.</i>

<i>And I have</i>
<i>no experience of you.</i>

<i>Not as I once did.</i>

<i>Why don't I hold on</i>
<i>to what I've found?</i>

<i>( neil, in english )</i>
<i>you see that red band</i>
<i>in the sky right there?</i>

And you see that blue
down below it?

That's the earth's shadow
on the atmosphere.

Look. You see
what I'm talking about?

Stop for a second.

You see?
( females speaking french )

<i>( switch clicking )</i>

( sighing )

( neil speaks )
( in french ) look at me.

I'm not looking at you.

I don't want
to look at you.

You're not my father.

You think you're my father.
You're not.

Marina:
Tatiana...

Tatiana:
You're annoying me.

( speaking french )

<i>( marina singing</i>

<i>( classical score playing )</i>

<i>( organ playing )</i>

<i>( woman, in english )</i>
<i>father, I'm going</i>
<i>to pray for you.</i>

Thank you very much.
( speaks spanish )

So you will receive
the gift of joy.

Me?

<i>Because you're</i>
<i>so unhappy.</i>

( man speaks softly )

'cause you don't
come out too much.

Do you get lonely all the time,
or most of the time

When ain't nobody around?

So what you got
to say about it?

You gotta have
a little more excitement.

Just like when me and you
are around, and there
ain't nobody around.

"hey!"

The power hits you, brother.
It always hits me.

You can just say, "hey, power,"
and it hits me.

Hits me before
I can get it out.

( speaks in tongues )
see, the devil don't know
what I'm saying.

<i>And you won't know</i>
<i>and I won't know.</i>

I can feel the warmth
of the light, brother.

That's spiritual.

I'm feeling more
than just natural light.

Feeling the spiritual
light, see?

I can almost touch that light,
coming right from the sky.

( continues speaking )
 <i>( people chattering )</i>

<i>( man #2 speaking )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( chattering continues )</i>

The parish has grown a lot.

And we really
need more room

For the community
to get together.

We have plays,
we have dinners,

We have parties.

<i>We have c.C.D.</i>
<i>In the parish hall.</i>

<i>( continues speaking )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( woman speaks )</i>

<i>( man speaks softly )</i>

( mutters in english )

( continues speaking )

( both speak softly )

<i>( quintana, in spanish )</i>
<i>let me come to you.</i>

<i>( woman speaks english )</i>

<i>( deaf woman</i>

<i>( quintana, in english )</i>
<i>man is in revolt</i>
<i>against god.</i>

<i>The prophet hosea saw</i>

<i>In the breakdown</i>
<i>of his marriage</i>

<i>The spiritual infidelity</i>
<i>of his people.</i>

<i>In that broken marriage,</i>
<i>we see the pattern</i>
<i>of our world.</i>

<i>We wish to live inside</i>
<i>the safety of the laws.</i>

<i>We fear to choose.</i>

<i>Jesus</i>

<i>Insists on choice.</i>

<i>The one thing</i>
<i>he condemns utterly</i>

<i>Is avoiding the choice.</i>

<i>To choose is</i>
<i>to commit yourself,</i>

<i>And to commit yourself</i>
<i>is to run the risk--</i>

<i>Is to run the risk</i>
<i>of failure,</i>

<i>The risk of sin,</i>
<i>the risk of betrayal.</i>

<i>But jesus can deal</i>
<i>with all of those.</i>

<i>Forgiveness</i>
<i>he never denies us.</i>

<i>The man who makes</i>
<i>a mistake</i>

<i>Can repent.</i>

<i>But the man who hesitates,</i>

<i>Who does nothing,</i>

<i>Who buries his talent</i>

<i>In the earth...</i>

<i>With him,</i>
<i>he can do nothing.</i>

( in french )
my visa has expired.

We need to face the facts.

Some of these creeks

You talk

<i>( distant train whistle )</i>

No, he claimed he didn't
want to have kids

While he was in school.

( mutters )
neil: <i>She hadn't changed.</i>

So many student loans,

And this ranch

Will you pray with me?

<i>You knew.</i>

<i>Were you afraid?</i>

Jane:
<i>My mother says</i>

Is that what she said?

I told her I'd rather

Have a moonbeam than

The life I had before.

Can you?

You all have rings

Be faithful only to you...

<i>-</i>  <i>( children playing )</i>

<i>I love this feeling...</i>

<i>Even if it makes me</i>

<i>You miss</i>

It's great here.

<i>Honestly, at dad's</i>

Does it come

<i>Answer that</i>

<i>Which is of god,</i>

<i>In every woman,</i>

<i>Know each other</i>

<i>That never changes.</i>

<i>( continues speaking )</i>

<i>( man speaking softly )</i>

<i>I'd like to show you</i>
<i>here on the monitor...</i>

<i>( beeps )</i>
<i>- this is the area</i>
<i>of your uterus</i>

And the I.U.D. That you
have in place there.

<i>We feel like</i>
<i>one of the less</i>
<i>risky procedures</i>

<i>That we can do is</i>
<i>to remove this device.</i>

<i>And we see if those</i>
<i>symptoms don't resolve.</i>

<i>I think something that</i>

You and your husband
need to consider

Is with the absence
of the I.U.D.,

Is this a time
that you may want
to think about children?

<i>Or is there another means</i>
<i>for contraception?</i>

So I don't need to have
a hysterectomy?

<i>That's the good news.</i>

Thank you.

<i>( doctor continues, softly )</i>

<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to have children?</i>

<i>Someday.</i>

<i>And with affection</i>

<i>Freely give themselves</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

Neil:
<i>This ring I give you...</i>

<i>Is a sign of our</i>

You're crazy!

When we come back.

It's hidden.

You don't need anything.

You're free.

We're gypsies.

You're like me.
