Really?

All I'm saying is that

Some give you the windshield,
others give you the bug.

And today I'm an insect?

Bob, ESTs being totally
wasted here ...

... Because this is simply gold.

Friend, strongly suggest

You go home ...

As is.

There are only two in

By God, you've lost your mind?

Damn!

Son of a bitch!

Hello.

We come from the Sierra
Nevada of Santa Marta.

We are very honored to meet you.

Estn you in some sort of
charity or something?

This man is our holy
chamn Arawak.

We have traveled many miles, and
crossed many rivers to meet him.

Look, I'm in the middle of

Tmenlo all ...

Hello.

Well, we want to see you, Paul.

I can call you later, mom?

But Paul, they never

I'll take charge now, sir Danis.

I honestly do not remember.

Liar!

I saw it all, look at your car.

Is this your car sir?

neighbor's mailbox on the way home?

Not always, no.

That's Jim Jones and Curly, s.

Let's go now.

Thanks, I take care of that.

Go home for a drink, Jim,

I like your hat.

They will not do anything?

Estn on private property, there
is nothing we can do.

Come guys ...

... Do not worry about my
neighbor is a real idiot.

I can offer something ...

... A beer, water, juice?

S not if you have any of those.

Water to be fine, thanks.

S?

Of where they say
they are, again?

In the Sierra Nevada
of Santa Marta.

Where is it, exactly?

In the mountains of tropical
forests in Colombia.

Colombia?

Colombia, South America?

Well ...

These are holy men of
the Arawak tribe.

Ahuahua?
Arawak.

He is the spiritual leader ...

... The Mama.

Have been guided to your door by
the spirit of their ancestors.

My door?

At 2254 Avenue Roslin?

What are making?

It is a blessing.

A ritual of purification.

They believe they are the
keepers of the world.

Have lived in the rainforest, under
the shadow of the great spirit ...

... Of the mountain, for
thousands of years.

From the beginning of time ...

... There has been snow on
top of that mountain.

But ...

... Now the snow has melted.

Sorry to hear that.

The Arawak believe that if
the mountain dies ...

... The world suffer
the same fate.

I do not understand that
has to do with me.

They believe that you
are saving it.

Qu?

I am a car salesman ...

... To be honest, I'm not
even that anymore.

He said?

He said his former spirits have
great blessing on them.

Because you, is really
the choice.

Okay, you can stay tonight ...

... And tomorrow I take them
to the bus station ...

... And take it to go wherever
I need to go.

Thanks.

Must be hungry, right?

No s. ..

... I have.

See if I can prepare something.

It's turkey.

How long are going to be as?

Not s.

Hi man!

It was quite a stake
that you got today.

Yes, sorry.

However much you love me?
Qu?

I fixed it.

What fixed it?

Your job, you idiot!

Bob wanted to say goodbye and make
arrest, now can not do anything.

All that happened is that the windows
of the room exhibicin broken ...

... WILL BE deducted from your
commissions. That's all.

I need the car keys.

Take the car to the workshop, I
fully arranged for Saturday.

Done.

I told Bob ...

... If Paul goes, we go all.

Really?
No.

Of course not.
What are you, moron?

You're really lucky that
Nakamori want your ass.

He told Bob he was very excited to
see your best salesperson working.

Bob saw the phone with Nakamori,
seriously ...

... I think that really is cag.

Knows he can not kick you out.

Do not put me through?

I have someone here.
Ah got a girl inside?

Well, you've been hiding me!

Hey, respect ...

... Revenge sex is the memory
of you will not get tired.

It is ace.

Llmame only if you
need any help.

Be well.
I meant to her.

Okay, see you after.

As will be well?

I can bring a blanket
or something?

Estn well.

You must be tired.

Let me show you where the
room or est of guests.

I apologize, I'm not used
to having company.

Sorry, not even s your name.

Marisa, Marisa Orcs Daz.

I'm Paul, Paul Zadzig.

You're a acucaca too?

Arawak.

Arhuaca.

No. No, I'm from Bogota.

One working for the government
of Colombia ...

... To help people assimilate
into our society Arawak.

Wow, that's very
admirable of you.

S, well ...

... Instead of assimilating
them, they assimilated me.

Est the bathroom just
across the aisle ...

... Leave a light on for you.

It was very nice.

You know? wait a second.

This should stay.

Thanks.

Well, good night.

Good night.

You have a voice.

Paul, I'm Christine ...

... Listen ...

... I'm sorry I hurt ...

... I never wanted
this to happen.

How I feel if I were away
for the last two years.

I hope you do not mind,
I made some coffee.

Not for nothing, knew she had.

These guys are amazing.

S.

I did something to this plant?

No.

Empty the tequila?
No.

Look, I've been good ...

... But this is not well.

These shots were we.
This tequila bottle
cost me 30 dollars.

Now I have to go out
and get another ...

... You should not
have to do that.

Also I need back
my credit cards.

The Arawak do not need money.

Well, I realize that in this
country is quite useful.

Who are these people?

These people are the last of the
pre-Columbian civilization.

They have never known war ...

... Never been conquered ...

... Never felt threatened.

Up a secret path of
1300 steps ...

... To the top of an
inaccessible mountain.

His sense of time is
different from ours.

They speak of the conquerors
like it was yesterday.

They believe they have been secretly watching
the world for thousands of years.

They believe that what
is important ...

... Is not what can be seen, but
what connects all things.

Forgiveness is a little early
so you can understand that.

So you're saying I do not judos?

God did not see you
ah, das good.

Cared about, guys, tell me
why they threw my alcohol?

The head should be clear to receive
the message from the heart.

Well, tell your foot is going to go
in the ass if they do it again.

No, do not translate that.

They are doing?

It is a combination of marine
snails and coca leaves ...

... The relaxed, when they
feel anxious or nervous.

Coca leaves?

Recurdame not pass through customs
at the airport with these guys.

Tell them you do not
have to be nervous.

What say?

He said you do not want to be
the one to save them, sorry.

Marisa, You are an educated
person ...

... You have to explain that
I am not who they believe.

I can not save anyone ...

... I can not even save myself.

But do not get me wrong,
I'm flattered.

The Arawak not have the word
flattery on her tongue.

I wonder if they have the word
delusional in their language.

Do not translate that!

Let's get something to eat.

Kids want to eat? Food, food.

Put the leaves of coca away ...

... And we eat, we go.

How is that came up
here from Colombia?

Walk.

Walked?

Sometimes we cross rivers
by swimming.

What about the office, how is
that crossed the border?

That is why some times we
crossed rivers to swim.

As who are in the country
illegally?

Well, welcome to Los Angeles, half the
people in this town are illegal.

Encajarn perfectly.

Except for hats.

What say?

We are very fortunate to be here
the day of the great harvest.

It's like da harvest every
day, in this place.

Sorry, you will pay for it?

Sorry, l think the pear
page with this seed.

Great, is a very nice seed,
but prefer an bank money.

You have to pay for it.

Sorry, estn me, I will make
it over to the exit.

Well, thanks.

Please Djelid, l think that
bought it honestly.

Okay.

He wants to make a trade
for the apple.

There is a trade,
only can get it.

They like making deals.

Okay ...

... But it will cost
three seeds.

A?

Tell him that I was the number
one in sales last year.

Three seeds.

Two?

Well, two seed ...

... But I say that
s fucking est.

Do not translate that.

Very good, congratulations, you
just get a great deal ...

... And a new block of luxury.

And I get them.

There are fruits, vegetables and
other things for you guys.

There are also cans of tuna, a
can opener, and some water.

Thanks, has been more
than generous.

Well, I feel bad that you have
come this far for nothing ...

... Wanted to be the guy
they want, but I'm not.

Do not judge so harshly ...

... No forgiveness for us,
we love nothing more.

Try to remember that.

He says it's a very good apple.

Hope you have snow on
the mountain soon.

Vamos! Do not do that.

Hello!

Hi Paulie, it is impossible
to have you on hold.

Hi mam, hi Neal.

Narandamundi cool is that you
could come from Colorado?

S.

It was fate.

Vavanasalomi decided to make his trip
to India just when mom calls.

Pens that will be the ideal time
to visit my another family.

Good to see you again, Neal.

How are things at the monastery?

Quiet.

My God! What it happened here?

I bought one of those sparkling logs, I think
that sparkle more than you estimated.

Paul, you can be dead!

I hope not drinking again ESTs.

Mother talked about
this in the way ...

... We were not to confront
Paul about his alcoholism.

Thanks for not mentioning it.

Who has been caring
for your plants?

Wish that more would do this.

What you give?

Ms sun, I think.

Mam, you can give your plants more sun
burning your curtains only as Paul.

I can offer you a t?

Orgnic ...

... If you have it.

What do you think the
new apartment, Mom?

Is small, but nice, I do
not need much space.

You miss home?

Remember that the
shoulder injury -

Remember that the shoulder injury
I have from my school?

It does not hurt.

Wow, that's good news.

For the first time
in twenty years.

Not if decrtelo must, but
call me Christine.

What say?

I wanted to know how I
was in my new home.

Keep an instructor
of yoga with that?

Qu?

She did not mention.

Neal!

Thanks for the soup, mam.

I'm glad you liked it.

Do not you want some, Neal?

Hello mam!
T know I'm vegetarian.

But you always liked
my chicken soup.

I've been a vegan
for eight years.

Bean I forgot how much we enjoy
eating vegetables ...

Isolate with men ...
and strangers for weeks
without end.

Here we go.

Look at your watch mam, as time passed
before the first comment homofbico?

Guys, please.

L I am a Buddhist, you're
a car dealer.

The Buddhist, Buddhist
quin did you?

I spend my days looking
for lighting ...

... Trying to create more
compassion in the world.

Not like t, you spend your das
trying to fool the people.

Okay, first let's make
something clear ...

... I do not engaoa people ...

... And second, I have nothing
against gay people in s. ..

... Only the bitter, who use their
supposed spirituality ...

... Like a hammer to hit people who
believe spiritual inferiors.

I'm over your little ones
and petty jealousy.

Detnganse!
I will not tolerate this more
than they did his father.

How many times did he say?
The family first.

That's why he committed suicide?

They do not want to
talk about it?

Of course not, sorry.

I go.

If you touch the bell again, I'm going
to get very deep in the ass.

Well, how much anger.

Do it!

There are strange people
in the door.

Hey!
Children, lost their autobs?

Spend, spend, spend!

Meet my family.

Know these people?

S, she is Marisa, and they
are the avocados.

Arawaks.
Arcuacos, forgiveness.

They are from South America.

l is the mom.

Is mam?

Nice to meet you.

They are shamans, Colombia.

This is incredible!

This is my brother Neal ...

... And that's my mom.

My spiritual name is Narandamundi,
my brother can not pronounce it.

It's a great honor to meet the mother
and brother of the Chosen.

Chosen?

Come guys, we have soup.

Come, come.

Qu shamans are tribe?
Arawak.

I do not know.
Estn yanimanis connected to?

Do not know the people
you speak of ...

... But the Arawak estn connected
to all living things.

Well, I studied with the great
chamn yanimani Aranangaragi.

You know him?

Really?
Everyone in South America
Aranangaragi know.

Interesting.

By the way, they realize that
there is meat in the soup?

S.

For all the shamans
I know are vegans.

The supreme being knows that eating
meat blocks their spiritual path.

They can eat whatever they want,
not everyone has to be like t.

Well, they are vegetarian ...

... But believe to be more
Daino for their bodies ...

... Insulting his anfitrin ...

... To eat what was prepared.

That is a lovely custom, most
people should be like you.

Okay, we went back a bit? ...

... I'm an confused about how my brother
is one of the chosen people?

No chosen people, chosen.
I am the chosen, not t,
not Marindemongi, yo.

Really?
And how is that selected
the chosen?

How it works, use a
alcoholmetro test?

Come on, Paul, these people
are a deception.

You are in a very vulnerable state,
and estn taking advantage of it.

But we are your family.

If you see deep in your heart, you
can see who is having the time ...

... Right now.

Marisa, I'm only an
average guy ...

... Rising in the morning ...

... Going to work, comes home and
tries to take over your life.

And he finds it satisfactory?

S, my wife left me ...

... My boss wants to say goodbye, and
two days ago, almost melt my house.

But do not be deceived

There can be only a coincidence, there
must be some kind of explanation.

Afraid?

Fear of what?

In this world there are mysteries
that can not understand.

That's not the same person
I was yesterday.

Do not want to be the same
person I was yesterday.

Hello.

What happens?

I came to pick up some of my stuff,
and mam ah est inside.

How about in here, Mom?

Hi Paul.

I see that you're sitting
in the old seat of pap.

It's too big to fit
in my apartment.

As that Neal says you've
been here for a while.

No, not so long.

Need something?

S, have a coffee latte, maybe a blackberry muffin, y.
..

... If you do not have that, maybe
my third grade books ...

... Or my electric train
from there up.

The security guard says she has
three or four times a week ...

... And not leave until close.

Hey, Mom!

Perhaps you should consider getting
rid of some of this.

Why? is our life.

The s, but we are not usndolo,
maybe someone more able.

No! This is ours, we
need it, is ours.

Possessions degrade us.

They are an impediment ...

... For our transformation to
achieve a high posicinms.

Okay mam, Let 's go from here.

Do not you guys go, I'm fine.
Mom, come on!

Everything is fine.

All is not well!

T ESTs not good, I'm not well,
and he definitely is not well.

Wait, do not interpret my life!

Let's stop pretending that everything
is fine, because I do not est.

Only because your father is not
here does not mean that -

Here?
Is not here, you say it like
I was in the room next door.

We can only say?

Only because we can not say it?

Knew not what he was doing.

Why not tell us what
happened that day?

I do not remember.

Why not share it with me?

It was my dad too.

S sentacmodo not with quin
am, but avoid pruning.

You can not say that
about your father.

We do not talk the last couple
of years he was alive.

I was always trying
to come to l.

Wait for that phone call, to come and chat.
Never came.

He was always so easy for you.

Pruning only because hitting a baseball ball, or
going fishing without getting motion sickness.

I hated you for it.

T had everything an death.

Even that had.

Why do not I, why could not
commit suicide in my home?

Why could not at least
give me that?

he called me that day ...

... I was in the middle
of a business, y. ..

... He was upset,
wanted to see me.

I sent him home. "

There was this friend who
had for thirty years ...

... And she offered us a ...

... Society in the piercing
of oil wells at sea.

We were told it was safe, that there
were no way perdiramos ...

... Made a geological reconnaissance,
and everything.

As we put all our money
for jubilacin ...

... Everything habamos saved.

This is how we lost everything.

l I did not want to come to you.

I obligu to go, was too proud
to ask for your money.

I did not know that
more pruning to do.

I was drunk ...

... That's why I
do not remember.

He was stinking drunk.

Were forty cars.

It was this small company to hire
that was had been working ...

... And needed a replacement
fleet, a whole fleet ...

... I mean, that's like two years'
wages for many types ...

... But not me.

And I tena such ah, and I was about
to close the deal, just ah.

Then call pap.

I told him that anger
at a time ...

... And then the type
hesitation ...

... See?
that's the thing, you can not give
even a second of respite ...

... Or you lose.

And I was not going to lose this
guy, not going to lose.

As that Friday night, took
him for a drink ...

... And drank.

We drank!

And closed the deal.

S not how I arrived home.

I could not see.

Saba that something
is wrong, but ...

... I could not see it.

Only me away ...

... And keep walking.

Were forty cars.

Hello.

Hello mam.

What are you?
S.

Okay.
I have it, I repent.

Bring my stuff is very
sweet of you.

We had to hire a removal.

Well, we have a problem.
What, what now?

Only wait.

Come on, this heavy est.
Slo expected.

Neal, your dress is falling est!

Well, you chose to wear
skirts this morning.

Care dear, est edge
under your foot.

Mam, we can not take travs you!
You know?

It's all right.

It is too narrow to pass.
Is right.

Going straight, straight behind.

I have no eyes behind your
head, your going.

Stay to the left.
Cul left, yours or ma?

Okay, your right, your right.

Think we should go all out?

I take it inside ...

... Or should I eat?

As all deliveries at the door,
it's all yours, man.

I can ask you something?

S, of course.

This morning you said that
I was not the same person.

What made you say that?

I see something new.

What we have seen, is one of the
pair of red-tailed hawks ...

... Who have been evicted from their
eaves to 12 stories high ...

... In this luxury apartment building,
on Fifth Avenue ...

... Here in New York City.

The hawks have nested on this
site for seven years ...

That is the bird.

Cras ...
and they have every year.

The nest, however,
was withdrawn.

The Administration argues that the
birds were renters dirty ...

... And that their nest had great danger
to the inhabitants of the building ...

... And for pedestrians.

Since then there has been a growing
din of protesters ...

... Claiming that the nest is
returned to the building.

Was going on when the workers
were destroying the nest ...

... And fortunately I was able
to rescue the nest away.

With the breeding season
about to end ...

... The protesters fear that unless the
nest is returned to the building ...

... The Falcons lost the opportunity
to mate this season.

That's the same bird
in my dream.

Qu?

Because they are watching me?

Want to save this bird?

Is that it?
That's what they want to do?

But how will make it snow
on your mountain?

In the web of life, all
things connected estn.

That is until New York.

It is not anything close.

No algnpjaro around
here who can help?

Ms a bird close to this area.

In truth, there are a lot of
bird in the neighborhood ...

... As good as all ...

... Maybe even better.

It has to be that bird, right?

Well then, djenme think for a minute,
and imagine something.

We are grateful to the elected.

I did not say it will, only
let me think about it!

Tell them to stop with
that, I think!

This is like the second
time I see you smile.

Disclpenme for a second.

Hello?

Paul, I'm Christine,
we need to talk.

Look, I'm in the coffee
Ahmed in Arvin.

Good to see you.

I bring something to drink?

I drink more coffee.

I drink coffee too.

No, wait, are three shots
of tequila, thanks.

Now, because ESTs here?

Paul, s that it has been
difficult for you.

It has been difficult for both.

S? What happens, you do
not like to do yoga?

Well, I deserve that.

Be ...

... Est complete.

Comet error.

Well, I guess everything is to forgive,
take your bags in the car ...

... And move back home.

Paul -

Christine, it was good to see you again,
really, you look very nice ...

... I have to go.

How can you be so cruel?

Forgiveness?

Not understanding that ...

... How I can I be so cruel?

Do yoga with a guy ...

... Strips the toilet four years
of marriage, and I'm cruel?

I do not understand that.

Paul, s who hurt you,
and sorry ...

... But I'm coming to you.

All I want to know is if you
give us another chance.

Should not be so hasty.

As you said the yoga instructor seems
like a very interesting person.

I will make this charge
