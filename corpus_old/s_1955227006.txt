MAN: He knows that to
be redeemed by Satan,

He must die by blade or flame.

Infidel.

Hypocrite.

Conspirator.

Desecrator.

Unsanctified.

Imposter.

Deceiver.

Christian.


POLICE OFFICER: Mobile
three to mobile one.

It's happened again, Sheriff.

I found another body.

The poor son of a
bitch was broiled

And carved up like a
goddamned Texas barbecue,

Just like the others.

What's your 10-20, Sheriff?

Sheriff, do you read me?

Sheriff?

[Door closes]

Sheriff?

[Music playing]

What?

We must have missed
the turn off.

I thought we were
going the wrong way.

Then why didn't you
say something, huh?

SANDY: Well, I figured you
know what you were doing.

You're the one that wanted
to go this way, not me.

Here.

Look for yourself.

It's the shortest way.

Life is the devil's playground,
volcanic rock and lava beds?

Where's your sense
of adventure, huh?

Mm, and a big, soft bed
in Vegas with the man I

Plan to marry.

If and when he
ever gets me there.

Oh, we'll get there.

Nothing's gonna keep us
from that big, soft bed.

Keep your eyes open
for the turn off.

Honey, it's dark out there.

Scared?

No, it's just I wish we
wouldn't have come this way.

Relax.

We'll be in Vegas
before you know it.

So tell me about
that sister of yours.

Is she a dealer, or a showgirl?


Sorry to disappoint
you, but she teaches

Anthropology at the university.

Oh.

Well, how long has it been
since you've seen her?

Mm, 11 months.

But you know what they
say about identical twins.

No.

That they're never really
apart, no matter how far

Away they are from each other.

Susan and I are like
the same person.

ROD: Uh huh.

We think alike.

We feel the same emotions.

And if one of us gets hurt,
the other feels the pain too.

Oh come on.

That's just an old wives' tale.

It's true.

Remember when I got that pain.

Susan felt the pain too.

She called to find out
what I'd done to myself.

That could have
been a coincidence.

Then explain how she knew
we were coming up to Vegas

To get married tonight.

You're kidding me.

Hm mm.

She called this morning.

There, that must be it.

Are you sure?

It must be.

This has to be it.

Rod, look out!

Rod, I think we should
turn around right now

And go back to the main highway.

Then what, huh?

You know how far
it is to Barstow?

I don't care.

Sandy, this has to be it.

Rod, look.

Where'd it come from?

I don't know.

I'm going to catch up with it.

Rod, I really don't
think we should.

Look, whoever it is probably
knows where the road is.

[Car honking]

What's the matter with that guy?

Can't he see my lights?

Rod, you're going too fast.

Hey, wake up.

[Car honking]

Hey, the stupid son of a...

A town.


Look out!


Elli... Ellivnatas?

It's not even on the map.

There's a light up ahead there.

What time is it?

It's after 10.

I've got to call Susan.

I hope they have
a phone in here.

Come on.

Evening.

Want some coffee?

Mm hmm.

Just the phone.

Back there.

Only takes quarters
when it's working.

Excuse me, miss, is this
the road to Highway 15?

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Hi, it's me.

I knew you were gonna call.

Susan, I just
called to tell you

We're gonna be a little late.

Is everything OK?

SANDY (ON PHONE): Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine.

It's just that Rod
got this bright idea

To take a shortcut in
between Highway 40 and 15,

And now we're lost.

SUSAN (ON PHONE): Lost?

Well, we're not really lost.

We're just in this weird little
town on the road to Baker.

SUSAN (ON PHONE): Sandy?

Sandy?

What?

Oh, I'm sorry.

What'd you say?

You said you were in some town.

Oh yeah.

It's not even on the map.

Well, what's the
name of the town?

Sandy, are you all right?

Everything's fine.

So what's the name of
the town that you're in?

Oh, Elli... hello?


What's the matter?

The phone went dead.

Look, never mind.

The waitress told me that if
we follow this road for about

An hour, we'll be right there.

Let's go.

Don't you want your coffee?

No.

Nothing on the road
between Highway 40 and 15?

On the road to Baker.

Elliv, E-L-L-I-V. No.

OK.

Thank you, operator.

Still thinking about that town?

Don't you think it
was kind of strange,

The way those people
kept watching us?

A little maybe, but that's the
way people are in a small town.

Besides, I don't blame
them for staring at you.

It wasn't just the stare, it
was the telephone going dead

And, and... let's
forget about it.

Let's think about other things.

Like, uh, that big, soft bed.

What the?

What the hell is going on here?

We're in a canyon.

I don't get it.

Isn't this the road the
waitress said to take?

Yeah, it is, but why
would it dead end here?

I don't know.

Well, we're not going to
wait around to find out.

Come on.

[Engine noises]

It acts like it's out of gas.

[Engine noises]

Empty?

It can't be empty.

It was three quarters full
when we pulled off the highway.

[Engine noises]

Aw jeez, there's a
hole in the tank.

It wasn't made by
a rock, either.

Whoever did it probably did it
while we were inside the cafe.

But why?

I don't know why,
but whoever did it

Didn't want us to get very far.

They may be out there
right now watching us.

Oh god, what are we gonna do?

What are we gonna do?


Listen.


Holy shit!

Look, let's get the
hell outta here!


SATANIST: Infidel.

SATANIST: Christian.

SATANIST: Heretic.

SATANIST: Betrayor.

SATANIST: Faithless.
SATANIST: Disloyal.

SATANIST: Hypocrite.

SATANIST: Conspirator.

SATANIST: Desecrator.

SATANIST: Unsanctified.

SATANIST: Impostor.

SATANIST: Deceiver.

We're almost there.

You OK?

We can make it.

Come on, we can make it.

Come on.


Damn it, Sandy, run!


Lord and master
Lucifer, thou art.

SATANISTS: Lucifer.

The kingdom.

SATANISTS: Lucifer.

The power.

SATANISTS: Lucifer.

And the glory.

SATANISTS: Lucifer.

Oh, Prince of Darkness.

SATANISTS: Hail Lucifer.

Morlock.

SATANISTS: Morlock.

Amen.

SATANISTS: Amen.



My lord and master
Satan, I promise

To serve and obey you in
this life and all other lives

You choose for me.

And my disciples and
I promise to draw

All the people of this land
into all the evil that we can.

Lucifer!

Lucifer, Lucifer,
Lucifer, Lucifer,

Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer,
Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer!

What's happened?

Fill her up?

Did a young couple come
through here earlier?

The girl looked just like me.

If she looked like you,
I'd have sure remembered.

No, you're the first one in
here since late last night.

[Car engines]

Can you tell me where I pick
up and cut off to highway 40?

Quarter mile down the road,
first turn on your right.

That's pretty rugged
country out there.

You sure that's
where you want to go?

Are there any other towns
out there other than Kelso?

None that I know of.

No one's quite figured out
what Kelso's doing out there,

Either.

In fact, they call that
area the devil's playground

For a damn good reason.

Just like going through hell.

It'll be $8.50.

None of my business really,
but you seem like you're

Pretty upset about something.

Well, I was supposed to
meet my sister and her fiance

Last night.

They were supposed to
meet me in Las Vegas.

She phoned from some town
called Elliv something or other.

Said it wasn't on the map,
but it was between highway

40 and 15 on the road to Baker.

Can't be out there.

I've been over that road.

There's nothing out there.

Could be she thought she
was on the road to Baker.

Hell, you know, one
road looks like the next

Out there, especially at night.


She called me from some place.

Maybe I can find it.

You bet.

Listen, I go right by there.

If you can wait a while
until my backup gets in,

I'll be happy to take you
out there in the truck.

Thanks very much, but I can't.

[Music playing]

Sandy!

Sandy!

A pentagram?

Oh, oh!

What are you doing here?

How'd you find me?

I thought you might
need some help.

I saw your, uh, Aero back there,
so I just followed the tracks.

You know, the only
hard part was following

Your tracks from the car.

There's a lot of
footprints down there.

That was their car.

There's a hole in the gas tank.

This belongs to my sister.

I have one just like it.

Take a look down there.

What the hell is that?

A pentagram.

A what?

It's a five-pointed star,
a satanic sign of evil.

I don't get it.

What's it doing down there?

I don't know.

I'm almost afraid to find out.

Two points projecting
upwards towards the east.

A reversed pentagram,
a satanic sign of evil.

It's still wet.

Something dreadful's
happened here.

I can feel it.

Must have happened last night.

A broken crucifix, the
symbol of sacrifice.

We better get out of here.

[Car engine starting]

Look, I'll bring my
tow truck up tomorrow

And pick up your sister's car.

Look, about that
blood back there,

I wouldn't worry about it.

It more than likely came from
a coyote or some other animal.

And what about those
footprints around the car?

And the hole in the gas tank?

And a road that dead
ends into a canyon?

How do you explain that?

I just have the
strangest feeling.

It's like Sandy's calling me
from somewhere with something.

That road into the canyon.

It had to start
somewhere, right?

Yeah, I guess so.

Well then maybe they followed
it back to where it began.

Yeah, but out here
that could be any place.

Even to a town
that's not on any map?

You're not thinking
of following that road?

Why not?

In the dark, in that car?

My sister's life
may be at stake.

I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

If something happens
to you out there,

It's not gonna do your
sister a damn bit of good.

I'm a big girl.

I can take care of myself.



I've been swept
off my feet before,

But never quite like this.


You OK?

Mm hmm.

Damn boulders.

Probably sitting up there for
months, waiting to shake loose.

It was no accident.

Somebody's trying
to scare me off.

But it won't work.

Thanks for your help.

Wait a minute.

With a little luck, I
may get a chance to sweep

You off your feet again.

Get in the truck.

I'll help you follow the tracks.

This is the way
they came, all right.

I don't see any tracks
leading back out.

Still want to go on?

Yeah.

OK, let's go.

[Car engine starting]

I don't get it.

The tracks just stop right here.

That's impossible.

They've got to
continue somewhere.

Yeah, but they don't.

Well, then somebody
must have destroyed

Them, someone who
didn't want anyone

To know where they led to.

Well, there's no way to
find more tracks tonight,

Even if they're still there.

I guess not.

But I'm not giving up.

They were deliberately led
into that canyon by someone

They met in that town.

You still think there's
some kind of satanic town out

Here someplace?

Yeah.

And I feel that whatever's
happened to my sister

And her fiance started there.

So you think that's what
that pentagram was all about?

It's possible.

You know, satanism
isn't something that's

Practiced out in the open.

It's... especially
when there's animal

Or human sacrifice concerned.

Isn't that a bit far-fetched?

No more far-fetched
than, uh, tire

Tracks vanishing into thin air.

I mean, you yourself
said that people

Have disappeared in this area.

I mean, maybe it's because
they found something

They weren't supposed to find.

What do you want to do now?

I came here to find my sister,
and that's what I intend to do.

How?

Maybe we should
call the police.

Look, I got an idea.

Why don't you come
back to my place?

I mean, it's not much,
but you can get a hot bath

And get a good night's sleep.

You'll be able to think
more clearly tomorrow.

We can't do much here tonight.

No, really, I can't.
All right, listen.

You can take the bed.

I'll take the couch.

No, really, I can't.

You don't trust me.

All right, you've got a guest.

Great.

But I think we
should do one thing

Before I sleep in your bed.

What?

Introduce ourselves.

My name's Dan Allen.

Susan Russell.

I'll have your car
here by morning.

Well this ain't Caesar's Palace,
but it's, uh, it's comfortable.

Make yourself at home.

Can I make you a drink?

Oh, that'd be great.

Good.

Uh, bourbon OK?

Yeah, that, that's fine.

You're being awfully kind to me.

Why?

I guess I'm just a sucker
for pretty girls in distress.

Have you, um, lived
here all your life?

Practically.

I was born about
five miles from here.

Cheers.

All that's kind
of boring though.

I'd rather hear about you.

Well, what is it that
you'd like to hear?

Well, to begin with,
how come you know

So much about this black magic?

I teach anthropology.

What?

Anthropology.

It's the study of man
and his various cultures.

Um, since the beginning
of time, man has studied

Some form of ritual magic.

That pentagram we saw?

It represents one of
the most extreme forms.

It's the belief
that Satan is God

And evil is the
highest form of good.

It's all very interesting.

You mind if I put on some music?

I'd really like
to take my bath.

Yeah, sure.

It's right in here.

This is it.

Uh, bathroom's right in there.

Thanks.

Sorry I don't have any
pajamas for you to wear.

That's OK.

I'll manage.

Well, good night.

Good night.

Uh, Susan?

You said something about
going to the police.

I'm not sure that's
such a good idea yet.

There's something about
that sheriff I don't trust.

Maybe you're right.

Good night.

Good night.

[Water running]


Sheriff?

Morning.

What can I do for you?

I want to file a
missing person report.

Who's missing?

My sister and her fiance.

They were on the road to Baker.

How long?

Over 24 hours.

She called me from
some town out there.

24 hours, sister,
phone, from Kelso.

No, not Kelso.

It was another town.

Another town?

She said it wasn't on the map.

It was Elliv something.

The line went dead as
soon as she said the name.

Somewhere between
Highway 40 and 15.

You say it was between
Highway 40 and 15.

On the road to Baker.

Well, your sister's
right about one thing.

It isn't on the map.

Well, maybe it's too
small to be on the map,

But I know that it
has to be there.

Why?

Because my sister
phoned me from there.

Excuse me, Sheriff.

Telephone call for you.

OK, Miss Russell.

I'll get to it in a minute.

The operator said that she had
no listing for any such town.

Look, Miss Russell, it's
very easy to get mixed up

Out there, especially at night.

Did it ever occur
to you your sister

Could have been mistaken?

Yeah, until I found her car.

It was in a canyon, and there
was a hole in the gas tank.

I think someone
deliberately led them there.

Go on.

I followed the tire
tracks back about a mile.

And?

They just stopped.

What do you mean,
uh, they stopped?

They just disappear.

I think someone
deliberately destroyed

Them so that no one could
follow them back to that town.

Well, here we are back
to that mysterious town.

Look, my sister could
be in serious trouble.

I found a pentagram
burnt into the ground

Near that canyon in blood.

Pentagram.

Do you know what that means?

Yeah, I know what it means.

Nothing.

Nothing.

Did you find a body?
No.

Well, then there's
nothing I can

Do, not for another
24 hours anyway,

Until they are officially
considered missing.

Now, if they don't
show up by tomorrow...

Well, they could
be dead by then.

Well, where can I reach you in
case something does turn up?

The devil's playground.

SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

DAN (VOICEOVER): There's
something about that sheriff

I don't trust.

SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

DAN (VOICEOVER): There's
something about that sheriff

I don't trust.

SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

DAN (VOICEOVER): There's
something about that sheriff.

SHERIFF (VOICEOVER):
Nothing I can do.

Nothing I can do.

Nothing I can do.

Nothing I can do.

If I get lucky.

God damn it.

Get up front,
I'll slow her down.

Hey lady, you're
starting to piss me off.

God damn it.

It's so I can't even see.

Pull over, you punk.

Oh, shit!

Right there, that's
where they went off.

It's gone.

They must have taken it away.

Well, something went
off here all right.

You stay here.

I'll go down and check it out.

There's blood down
here, all right.

Could be an animal's,
I don't know.

Still wet.

Yeah, I believe you.

What do you want
me to do about it?

Do about it?

I want you to go
after those bastards.


Well, who are they?

I don't know.

I saw them pass the gas
station the other day.

What difference does
that make, anyway?

It makes all the
difference in the world

Because if you don't know who
they are, who the hell am I

Supposed to go after?

Look.

If you just follow the
tracks, I'm sure that they

Came from that town.

Look, Miss Russell,
with all due respect,

What you know about dune
buggies don't amount

To a pitcher of warm spit.

I mean, they could be
anywhere out there.

I'm not about to go
chasing after them, tracks

Or no tracks, not in that.

And as far as another
town is concerned,

It's like I told you before.

It isn't on the map.

If you just follow the road,
you'll see where it goes.

I know where it goes.

Nowhere.

Just like every other
road in this desert,

Mile after empty mile,
point blank into oblivion,

And that's it.

So then you won't do it.

No, ma'am.

Well then...

I guess that's a waste of time.

I'll follow it myself.

Look, I can't tell you,
tell you what to do.

I can't tell you...

That's right, you can't.

No, but I can give you
some friendly advice.

Why don't you go home before
you get yourself into trouble?

Huh?

I can't wait that long,
and neither can my sister.

Miss Russell?

I just want you to know that
I'm going to do everything

I can to help find your sister.

And I admire your spunk.

I just think it's a damn
stupid idea to go back

Out there, especially alone.

I get your point.

Susan, why don't you
go home, get some rest,

And let me handle this?

Do that for me?

OK?

OK?

[Car engine starting]

Sandy, show me the
way to that town.

[Car engine starting]



SATANIST LEADER: For thine
is the kingdom and the power

And the glory, amen.

SATANISTS: Amen.

Come in, my dear.

We've been expecting you.

Welcome to the house of Satan.

The authorities know
I'm here if anything

Should happen to me.

There is no
authority but Satan's.

It is his intent
that you be here.

You've done with my
sister and her fiance.

Why, they willingly
sacrificed themselves to Satan.


You bastard!

You'll pay for this!

As God as my witness!

God?

There is no God but Satan.

That's what I
think of your Satan.

Kneel!

Kneel, you irreverent bitch.

You impious slut, yield
to the Prince of Evil.

Surrender thy unglorious soul
to him that is hell-born.

Fuck you!

Yes, yes that's exactly
what you are going to do.

You are going to fuck
me again and again

Until thy belly is swollen
with child, a child that

Is born unto Satan himself.

Then, whore, shall ye know
the mark of the beast,

Incarnate in thy bastard child.

Take her to the
sacrificial pentagram.

Morlock!

Morlock!

[Non-english speech]

[Non-english speech]

[Non-english speech]

[Non-english speech]

My lord and master
Satan, sanctify

This unholy fornication.

Breathe life into
the unborn fetus

That shall bear thy mark as the
highest glorification of evil.

And empower this
chalice of toad's blood

With thy potency,
that I may fertilize

This blaspheming slut.

Woman!

Turnest thou away
from that which

Senteth thee out of paradise?


Know ye not Satan's serpent
that corrupted thy womb

And cast thee forever in the
depths of everlasting fire?


[Breathing heavily]

Ye cannot withstand the serpent!

For rejecting the
serpent, prepare

To surrender thy unhallowed
flesh to all that is evil.



Now, whore, shall ye
know the hard-on of sin.



Kill her!





Which way did she go?

I don't know, but
we better find her.

Did you really
think you'd escape?


I'll follow her.

You go get help.


Down here!















[Car engine revving]

I found the town.
[talking while crying]

I've got to get to the
police before they get away.

Now hold on.
Hold on.

Easy, easy, easy, easy.

Take this.

Take this.


Son of a bitch.

I'm sorry.

You just had me nervous.

Why did you leave
without telling me?

I... I had this nightmare.

I dreamed that you were
a disciple of Satan,

That you had the number
666 tattooed on your wrist.

666?

The mark of the beast.

A satanic symbol of evil.

Susan, Susan.

It was just a dream, nightmare.

The night Sandy died,
I had a nightmare.

Now that I think about it,
it's more like a premonition.

Guess that was why
I was so frightened

The night... the night that I
had the nightmare about you.

Don't worry about it.

Forget it, forget it.

Come on.

Come on, let's go.

This whole thing
has been a nightmare.

It'll be over soon.

Did anyone else know you
were coming back out here?

Why?

I'm just curious.

I phoned, the, um, sheriff's
office yesterday evening.

What?

Yeah.

If, they, uh, don't hear from
me they're to talk to you.

Why me?

Why not?

You're one of 'em.

Sue, you've been out
in the sun too long.

You don't know what
you're talking about.

I know that wasn't a
nightmare I had about you.

It was a premonition, just
like I had about Sandy.

Only the 666 wasn't
on your wrist.

It was on the back of your neck.

Susan, I tried to
warn you to stay

Out of the devil's playground.

We could have had something.

We could have had
something special.

But no, you wouldn't
listen to me.

Now you leave me no choice.





Oh!


Susan!

Susan!

Susan!

Susan!

Susan!

Susan!

Stay away from me?

The hell's the matter with you?

You're one of them!

That's not true.

Now, listen, Susan.

Your sister wasn't the
only one to disappear.

There were others too.

And I've known for... or I've
suspected for a long time

There, there was a cult behind
it and that Dan was one of 'em,

But I couldn't prove it.

Not until now.

But I know now, and it's OK now.

Give me your hand.

Keep away from me.


Come on.

Jesus Christ.

Are you all right?

Huh?

It's OK.

Come on.

Let's get home.

Get something to eat.

[Music playing]
