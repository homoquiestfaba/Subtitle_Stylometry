Good. Yes, that's fine. Hello.

Hello.

Hello.

You fucking pussy.

-Hey.
-Hey.

I would like to submit these.

But first a question ...

What was it that really happened?

You were well clear instructions
whether to stay and wait?

Or is it something we've missed?

It was my fault.

They were on their way out and I ...

You received an express order
to stop and wait for reinforcement!

Did not you?

-Yes, but it would take ...
-So you heard!

But you acted exactly the opposite
Is that correct understood?

-Yes, but
-No, but damn!

You understand what could have happened?

Damn kids!

What I wanted to say is ...

... I'm very happy
n that's okay.

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

Thank you.

Shall we go out and walk? When we do so.

-Do we know how much they came over?
15 million under SkandiGuard

And this murder ...
Is it something related?

-It 's not what we see.
-Then, we separate investigations.

The body was badly
according to Karin Linder.

He is shot in the head.
Svartman was the first place.

-Where is he?
-Available.

Damn, we manage two investigations
and the two men short.

Call Svartman.

As you know, took some pictures Pontus
with his camera phone.

Here we Marko Lehtinen.

It is hogerhanden
to this guy -

-Leonard named Belker

He sat at Kumla in eight years,
then ran away and he is wanted.

He is probably active.

July 28, 2002 in Märsta,
a raid on eleven million.

-Svartman are going.
-Thank you. August 25, 2005 in Hallunda.

15 million.
Four days later Akalla, 19 million.

"There are no amateurs.
-What is interesting is how he works.

Robberies twice
every few days.

First staging something spectacular
so the police are busy.

"When chaos is worse, turn it into.
-Then we can wait one to robbery.

There will we be prepared for.

-Hey.
-Aren 't you leave today?

I thought it,
not to speak about my wife.

-What?
-Oh, nothing.

"It was a sour old man.
-Bye.

Bye, Ebba. We are on the phone.

-Take care of Jussi.
-You say it.

-Hey.
-Svartman! Hello.

Be precise body found
in the watercourse?

There. Eggelstad.

Theoretically, the scene of the crime lie
well upstream.

Be Linder fast on
if there is a link to the robbery.

She is ready for lunch
and found a thing on the discovery site.

-A little thing.
-The offender was a minor.

It seemed like an entire kindergarten
had barging around there, "she said.

She told me to hand over
it Svartman.

I do not understand why.

Then you health Linder
I was free.

-Would I have locked the kids?
-Come on.

It is a major setback.

Last year, we laid down
enormous resources on security.

-What did you do?
-A major analysis of our procedures.

<i> Here is a long list.
You can follow me. </ I>

Is there anything else you can come to me.

Ystad police want to ask some questions.

Of course. Mike Sterner.

You set the schedule for shipments.
-Yes, just to the south of Sweden.

Counted as Ystad in southern Sweden?

-Should I be honest ...
"There, we assume.

-This kind will not be possible
"It does.

Like, it does not matter
how secure a system is.

-Can you explain how you work?
-Yes.

We run three cars, two of which are empty.

Körsohemat encrypted
individually to the drivers.

They do not know themselves
if they are running with empty boxes.

You are responsible for the encryption
Southern Sweden?

I'll tell you about a competitor.

A few years ago
were subjected to the raids.

They improved their methods,
but the robbers were always the right car.

It was a town that was leaking.

He felt the encryption?

Arena had studied at KTH
and was an expert in cryptography.

How does it himself?

You have increased resources for security
the last year.

I have a new lock
and we have video surveillance.

Can you see the recordings
from the last month?

It can be difficult.
I do not think they will save the links.

Sorry.

This should be
throughout the last month.

-Fine, thanks.
-Thank you.

The bullet penetrated through pannbenet
and penetrated the left hemisphere.

It went out through the back of the head

-How long has he been dead?
-One week, plus or minus two days.

Nothing of water in the lungs,
so he was probably dead before he came in.

Could he have been murdered somewhere else
and floated to Eggelstad?

It is possible.
Identification will not be easy.

Fingerprints
there was no code.

Dental impressions are analyzed.
It takes time.

I understand.

An athletic man, around 55 years.
That is what I can say.

Something more?

This was in the pocket.

Hello.

-How does it work? If you find something?
-Nothing.

That's him all the time.
Not a visit to two weeks.

-What is he doing?
Jobs.

Can you play at normal speed?

Damn, that's of course Internet poker.

Damn, I thought he was working.

-How long has he been doing?
-All the time.

Is he a compulsive gambler?

Gambling debts?
Then he has a damn good reason.

We can not pick him for it.

He is the only one who knows
driving schedule before it is encrypted.

Does he have gambling debts -

-is it reasonable that he is open
for every conceivable proposal.

I think we should wait
until we find something more.

Look what I got today.

There are more than Sven and Mette
with foreign plans.

A colleague and his wife
skaa move to the south of France.

"Provence,
two kilometers from the salt bath. "

A fantastic house.

-How the hell did you afford that?
-Free sector.

He switched to corporate law.

-Maybe you should change jobs?
-No.

He defended a construction company
who used a float trowel -

-who had given every tenant
tracheal problems, especially the children.

-A clear conscience is the best pillow.
"Yes, let them rotate in insomnia

They have all fa
a fantastic house.

400 gross square meters of stunning.

You may well bite on Sven's proposal?

Then you buy a house
and invite me down

-See you.
-Yes.

Svartman!
A woman called five times -

-on a car that is on her land.

-Could you take it?
-No, I'm going to lunch.

You may well take something on the road?

-Thanks, you are ...
... "The best". I know.

Damn.

-Hey. Johan Svartman, Ystad police.
-Christina Tham.

It is my land you spill on.
Here it is.

-Fine!
-UGLY. Take it now?

Kurt.

Hey, Svartman.

You may ask her to call the municipality.

Explain politely
that she can stop her lawyer ...

An Amazon?

-Hey.
-Have you checked license plate numbers?

No, I have not had time.

Is it your car, drive it away.

The car does not move
until I say so.

You can go. We will contact you.

He managed
had these keys.

Contact Nyberg and vehicle registration office.

The car is registered on
Harald Claesson, Guresgränd 1A.

Good, then we will go there.

Kurt! Come.

He has selected a route on the map.

That cross,
that was where we found the Amazon Basin.

He has been out and oriented,
so anything happening here.

He is shot, body dumped
in the water and float -

-down here to Eggelstad
where we found the body.

The question is
what happened along the road.

I could go the way
and check out a bit.

It is good that you suggested yourself.

That takes a day.

One day the forest is what I need.

I talk a job now.
No fucking picnic.

No, of course.

"It's good. We heard.
-Yes

-Hey. Oh, hey you.
-Hey.

-Molly!
"She felt I uktar dog.

Is Sven-home?
-Yes. He sits in the sauna.

-You can get along nicely.
-I am not complaining.

Not really.

It was not
for money, I ended -

-but it does not hurt
when they roll into.

It was time. How do you say?

"Only the rich
prevailing over their own time. "

And it makes you?
-Yes, now.

I work more than rarely.

As police worked, I continued,
evenings, weekends ...

I know.

The marriage went down the drain.

It was my fault.

So we sat there without life
in addition to the job.

The compromise I do not like
with Mette.

I got a second chance.

She deserves everything I can give her.

What about you? Have you not thought of
to marry again?

The idea may well beat sometimes.

Did you make safety analysis
on SkandiGuard?

That's right. About a year ago.

We look at them
in connection with robbery

Yes, it was their transportation.

I went through
their internal practices.

Is there a gap ...

Did you hear about
by Mikael Sterner?

Yes, he did a little for himself -

-but he seemed serious

-You do not suppose ...?
-No.

"We believe nothing yet.
-Here is Mette.

-Hey.
-Come here. Come.

Come and visit.

Come and visit me.

She knows that I uktar dog.

-Were you a good hand?
-Excuse me?

It must be difficult to fold
when you sit on a good hand.

"I do not understand.
No?

Bells on my Saagar
"Poker" and "addiction"?

I am not an addict.

Do you have gambling debts?

No, I do not.

On the contrary.

Poker gives me
a steady side income.

lnom one years, I say me
to become professional players.

You can see my bank accounts.
I have no secrets.

There were no gambling debts?

He earns more in poker
than the three of us are doing together.

Perhaps it is to do
so you can move south.

-What you talking about?
-No, nothing.

Okay, back to square one.

-Hey, Nyberg.
-Hey.

-How does it work?
-Joda.

The lab has sent the report
the explosive from the shipment.

There were no sensations.

It was a primer, remote ...

Yes, on a signal.

Is it the type
which has been used in the other wafers?

Yes, but it does not mean anything.

The military uses the dough.
It is easy to obtain.

One thing that was weird ...

The amount of dough and apteringen
was nasty like.

-Okay. Thank you for so long.
-Thank you.

You ... What would you do

-If you had unlimited
money during the holidays?

Purely hypothetical?

I would do what I do.

Two weeks in Iceland,
excavation and fishing.

It is expensive to snuff

If they called and said
that you had received an inheritance

-from an unknown aunt in America,
what would you do?

I would probably go home
and devote myself to what I like.

How do you work?

I met a colleague from the past.
He has a lot of money.

He would take early retirement
and do not give a shit.

It sounds like shit.

-Had he inherited?
-No, he has worked them together.

-Yes, he may not have been the police.
-No, you're right in.

I'll call when I get a moment.
It is good.

Now I am not ...
Were not you told to rest?

"It was a prescription
-You were told to go home and rest.

I know, but we would look up
one thing about cars.

-There must have been witnesses.
"We heard them, we could get in.

We thought somebody shot
and laid out on the web.

Right. Check it out, then.

Then you go home and rest.

-Is not it beautiful?
-What are they doing here?

Lame and sick, they are lagging here
to work.

-They 're sick. Slot, then?
-What the hell are they to do with it?

"I can check it out.

I just drove a car into the square.

And after that?
"I left the car and pulled.
