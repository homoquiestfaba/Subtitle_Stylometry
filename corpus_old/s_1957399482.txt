[indistinct chatter]

So we may look past
our grief

and focus on the life

and achievements
of our beloved king.

Though our noble father
has been released

from this mortal coil,

cast back
into the material waters

from which all things rise

and stand courageous.

Unerring in the shade

of thy reaper.

â™ª Well, I won't die
for love â™ª

â™ª But I've got a body
here to bury â™ª

â™ª And if truth be told,
it's scary â™ª

â™ª 'Cause my shoulders
are heavy already â™ª

â™ª And, yeah, I know â™ª

â™ª The parts of myself
that I've hated â™ª

â™ª And I can't tell
which ones are mine â™ª

â™ª And which I created â™ª

â™ª But I won't die
for love â™ª

â™ª But ever since I met you â™ª

â™ª You could have my heart â™ª

â™ª And I would break it
for you â™ª

I have given
you everything!

You have given me nothing
but a lifetime of misery!

I will teach you some...

respect!

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Take one in the temple â™ª

â™ª My tongue is a vessel â™ª

â™ª I try to be careful â™ª

â™ª With the thing
inside my chest â™ª

â™ª You shoot
for the memory â™ª

â™ª So you can forget me â™ª

â™ª I'd leave if you let me â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª But I won't die for love â™ª

â™ª But ever since I met you â™ª

â™ª You could have my heart â™ª

â™ª And I would break it
for you â™ª

â™ª Please don't leave â™ª

I'm teaching it a lesson â™ª

â™ª Baby, it's a blessing,
yeah â™ª

â™ª You got me thinking
that I was too mean â™ª

â™ª Well, everything that I say
I believe â™ª

â™ª Tuck a knife with my heart
up my sleeve â™ª

â™ª And change like a season â™ª

â™ª Reason for nothing,
I am disruptive â™ª

â™ª I've been corrupted â™ª

â™ª And by now, I don't need
a fucking introduction â™ª

â™ª I've been gone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I've been
on this road too long â™ª

â™ª You know, I get
too caught up in a moment â™ª

â™ª I can't call it love
if I show it â™ª

â™ª I just fuck things up,
if you noticed â™ª

â™ª Have you noticed?
Tell me, have you noticed? â™ª

â™ª I get too caught up

Tell me, have you noticed? â™ª

â™ª Now I'm wondering
if I ever wanted to hold you â™ª

â™ª It never mattered
if I owned you â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you'd let anybody
with a body control you â™ª

â™ª And you know it, too â™ª

â™ª You got me feeling
like I been too mean â™ª

â™ª And everything
that I say I believe â™ª

â™ª Tuck a knife with my heart
up my sleeve â™ª

â™ª And fuck like a demon â™ª

â™ª Do it like nothin' â™ª

â™ª I am disgustin' â™ª

â™ª I've been corrupted â™ª

â™ª And by now I don't need
no help to be destructive â™ª

â™ª I been gone â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I been

â™ª I can't fall in love
'cause I'm focused â™ª

â™ª I just fuck things up,

[Halsey's "The Lighthouse"]

â™ª From a tender age,
I was cursed with rage â™ª

â™ª Came swinging like a fist
inside a batting cage â™ª

â™ª I went swimming
with the Devil â™ª

â™ª At the bottom of a lake â™ª

â™ª And he left me there â™ª

â™ª By my lonesome â™ª

â™ª He was tall and mean
with venom eyes so green â™ª

â™ª Wanted reconciliation, but
my tongue was in my teeth â™ª

â™ª I couldn't find the floor,
so I was kickin with my feet â™ª

â™ª But they weren't there â™ª

â™ª They were stolen â™ª

â™ª There is a lighthouse â™ª

â™ª In the middle of the deep â™ª

â™ª And I'm still stranded
on the shoreline there â™ª

â™ª Nobody hears me scream â™ª

â™ª And I will lure you
like a landslide â™ª

â™ª And I'll show
you lovely things â™ª

â™ª If you rescue me,
but they're make-believe â™ª

â™ª The lighthouse
by the sea â™ª

â™ª I met a sailor on a ship
with promise in his eyes â™ª

â™ª He kissed me on the mouth â™ª

â™ª And dug his fingers
in my thighs â™ª

â™ª But a sailor
ain't a savior â™ª

â™ª 'Cause they only
tell you lies â™ª

â™ª So I left him there â™ª

â™ª Till the sunrise â™ª

â™ª Well, the waves were tall,
and they were crashing down â™ª

â™ª He's laying in the water
begging God to let him drown â™ª

â™ª So I showed him
all my teeth â™ª

â™ª And then
I laughed out loud â™ª

â™ª 'Cause
I never wanted saving â™ª

â™ª I just wanted to be found â™ª

â™ª There is a lighthouse â™ª

â™ª In the middle of the deep â™ª

â™ª And I'm still stranded
on the shoreline there â™ª

â™ª Nobody hears me scream â™ª

â™ª And I will lure you
like a landslide â™ª

â™ª And I'll show you

[bird cawing]

Since the
departing of our king,

you have revealed
your most unbecoming nature...

gallivanting about with
those harlot friends of yours.

As his widow,
you have a responsibility

to conduct yourself
with dignity and honor...

yet you walk with
the widened gait of a whore.

As your queen,
I'm allowed to behave

in any way that I see fit.

Or must I remind you
that this widening gait

once enveloped and devoured the
man that you call your king?

I see no queen.

I see a filthy child dressed up

in the trappings of a title
into which she was not born.

Your wicked tongue makes
light of the whispers

which would place a bounty
on any other head.

Can't a queen mourn
the loss of her beloved king

in any way that she'd like?

You have maintained your
innocence from the start,

and you were allowed
that innocence

as a way to placate
public perceptions

as we investigated
the murder of our king.

I and others
are beginning to suspect

that these may not be
just rumors.

Okay.

So then you'll let townsfolk

be the judge, jury,
and executioner of a queen?

You'll let
the gossiping of peasants

determine a queen's fate?

Does the royal blood
flow through your veins?

Are you in the direct
lineage of rulers?

No.

Our beloved king has departed

and your title along with it.

All I see is a common widow.

Make no mistake,

the blood with which my veins
carry may be common,

but the child in my womb
is all that remains

of your royal blood

and all that remains
of your king.

If the child you carry,

the rightful heir
to this throne, is a boy,

then the court
shall raise him up

to be an honorable king
like his father before him.

If a boy it is not,

it will be tossed into the sea.

Regardless of the child's fate,
you have defiled our court,

besmirched the crown,

and you will be executed for
your treason and wickedness.

You brought this upon yourself.


Now go,
and make yourself useful!

that presses â™ª

â™ª Like a blade
against my throat â™ª

â™ª Another word,
and I could choke â™ª

â™ª But what's worse? â™ª

â™ª Telling you my feelings â™ª

â™ª Or to die
without revealing â™ª

â™ª That you
crawled inside my head â™ª

â™ª And set a fire there
instead? â™ª

â™ª Letting all my insecurity â™ª

â™ª Devour me with certainty â™ª

â™ª That love
is just a currency â™ª

â™ª So take my pockets â™ª

â™ª Take me whole â™ª

â™ª Take my life
and take my soul â™ª

â™ª Wrap me in a wedding ring â™ª

â™ª You know, I swear
I'd give you anything â™ª

â™ª And I think
we could live forever â™ª

â™ª In each other's faces â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I'll always see
my youth in you â™ª

â™ª And if we don't live
forever â™ª

â™ª Maybe one day
we'll trade places â™ª

â™ª Darling, you will bury me â™ª

â™ª Before I bury you â™ª

â™ª â™ª
