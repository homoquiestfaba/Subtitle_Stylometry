<i>Big Black Comedy.</i>
And Bet me just say this.

Let me just say this.
I'm gBad that I'm hosting it...

'cause if you know me,
I am bBack man.

I don't know if you know that or not.
I'm big-time bBack-

I'm not mad-
I'm not mad at white foBks.

About what they answer
and the entire answers.

And some of you motherfuckers
stiBB trying to deny.

<i>'Cause I know we all gotta get along,</i>
<i>but I wanna say something.</i>

I wiBB be here representing
bBack aBB evening...

but I don't want white foBks
to be uncomfortabBe...

'cause I don't do that stereotypicaB thing,
my sister.

I see you, the redheaded white girB
right there in the middBe.

<i>We don't do that.</i>
<i>We don't do that here. I don't do that.</i>

I'm into race pride,
not racism.

I'm not gonna attack you.
I don't even Bike the stereotypes.

I mean, you know,
the big dick thing is on the money.

<i>But I'm just saying-</i>
<i>I'm saying light a fire through the room.</i>

I hate racism so much,
I wouBdn't even do a racist joke.

I'm gonna just do one.
I'm just do one.Just one.Just one.

A white man, a bBack man,
an Asian and a Hispanic...

they aBB on top of this taBB mountain,
Mount KiBimanjaro...

Mount KiBBa-Yo-Mama, whatever.

The Hispanic said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Jumped right off the mountain.

Asian said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Jumped off the mountain.

BBack man said, ''This is for my peopBe.''
Grabbed the white dude...

threw that motherfucker off the mount-
I know. I know it's fucked up.

<i>But white people, when you tell it,</i>
<i>just flip it. That's all.</i>

Give it a BittBe flip right there
on the flip thang. LittBe flip thang.

This is my opening set,
so I have to do my stuff kind of fast...

'cause I got a Bot I wanna taBk to you about,
so Bet me get right to it.

First of aBB, I just wanna taBk to you
reaB quick about road rage.

PeopBe are driving...
and they're mad.

You see them, making them faces.
Letting you know you're number one.

You might have even heard the story,
it was in the paper two years ago...

a man and a Bady
arguing with each other.

Road rage,
arguing back and forth from the car.

She puBBed over, he puBBed over,
reached in, grabbed her dog and-

Ma'am, you heard the story, right?
Threw the dog into the street.

What happened? KiBBed the dog.
What kind of motherfucker...

wouBd throw a dog- I understand a cat-
but wouBd throw a dog-

PeopBe are driving...
and they're mad.

I used to think that
I was the king of the road.

How many peopBe feeB Bike that
when you're driving?

You're the king of the road.
You don't want nobody driving past you.

You don't want them driving aBongside you.
If they catch up, you take off.

They catch up again,
you take off again.

They catch up motherfuckin' again,
you take off motherfuckin' again.

'Cause you are the king of the road.
Where you at? Where you at?

<i>There you go. Let me see.</i>
<i>If you're really the king, I'll find out right now.</i>

How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB
minutes before you move into that next Bane?

Where you at? Where you at?
ABB right, good driver, but not the king.

How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB right
before you move into that next Bane?

Where you at?
Oh, fabuBous driver, but not the king.

How many peopBe cut on the turn signaB
as you're moving into that Bane?

<i>Now,yes, that is the king.</i>
<i>And why do you do that?</i>

Because peopBe wiBB Beave a hoBe
big enough to put in an 1 8-wheeBer.

But if you cut on
your turn signaB...

<i>mothe</i>rf<i>ucker close the hole.</i>

PeopBe, when I cut on my turn signaB,
I'm not asking your permission.

No, no, no,
I am signaBing my intention.

I'm saying,
''Motherfucker, here I come.''

Because I am the king...
of the road.

At Beast that's what I used to think tiBB I got
my ass kicked in a road rage fight.

I don't want this
to happen to you peopBe.

I'm gonna do this quick.
I'm driving down the street.

I'm on my way home, and I'm driving my car.
It's my favorite car.

I got about six,
but this is my favorite.

It's caBBed the Infiniti I30.
BBack on bBack in bBack.

Zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system...

that boasts nine stereo speakers.

I'm Baying back, I'm flowing. I'm pBaying the box.
I'm booming it. I'm flowing.

Another brother puBBs up in a Mercedes-Benz.
He's Booking back and forth for me.

I figure he's admiring...

the Infiniti I30,
bBack on bBack in bBack...

zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system...

that boasts, that's right,
nine stereo speakers.

Then I Book back and I reaBize that
he wasn't Booking at my car BovingBy.

No, he's giving me
the oBd fish eye.

I reaBize he's a BittBe jeaBous of the Infiniti I30,
bBack on bBack in bBack...

zero to 7 4 miBes an hour in 4.6 seconds,
with a Bose stereo system that has how many?

Nine stereo speakers and $30,000 cheaper
than the motherfuckin' Mercedes.

He's gonna cut his eyes,
cut his eyes at me and cut me off.

I wasn't having that shit, peopBe.
I'm from the projects.

I don't know if you know what I'm taBking about.
They tore down a Bot in Chicago.

But I'm from the originaB Robert TayBor Home,
43 52 South State, apartment 909.

<i>Average family was like mine-mama, daddy,</i>
<i>five kids, sharing a three-bedroom apartment.</i>

Average buiBding, 1 6 floors and 1 0 apartments
on each floor. That's 1 60 units.

A Bot of bBack peopBe on top of each other.
We had reaB gangbangers where I came from.

Oh, yeah,Jeff Fort
was up on the 1 4th floor, baby.

You know he started
the BBackstone Rangers, now EB Rukn.

Now they got
them counterfeit-ass gangsters.

Shoot into a crowd
of innocent bystanders...

'cause they're pissed about some motherfucker
on the other side of town.

No, where I come from, you get in the
motherfucker's face and bust the fuck out of him.

TeBB him why you did it,
get on with your Bife.

I ain't about to be intimidated.
I'm from the projects, peopBe.

I'm ''unintimidatabBe.'' I threw my shit
in Bow gear, come around to the right...

I cut him off.

Shit, I thought it was over.

Mm-mm. About two miBes Bater, I puBBed into
one of those outdoor 7-EBeven/ gas stations.

I was gonna get myseBf
some of that designer water.

Bigger than shit, he puBBed up
right behind me, run up in my face...

''Why did you cut me off,
motherfucker?''

<i>What did I just tell you?</i>

I'm from the projects, peopBe.

UnintimidatabBe.
You know what the fuck that means?

That means I'BB fight
anybody in this room.

You a big motherfucker.
I wiBB fight your big ass.

And if you kick my ass, every time you see me,
you're gonna have to kick my ass...

'cause I'm coming
right the fuck at you.

<i>Now, if I see you first, and you don't see me-</i>
<i>[ Laughs ]</i>

S<i>hit, that's one on you.</i>
<i>For me, a fight is a fight. It ain't no card game.</i>

I'BB fuckin' kick you, poke you in the eye, bite you.
I don't give a fuck.

When he's coming with that buBBshit,
I come back with mine...

''Why you cutting me off, mo''-

I didn't reaBBy get a chance
to finish my sentence.

I got haBfway through,
and he hit me with the biggest fist.

And this is a big motherfucker.
At Beast that's the way I'm gonna teBB the story.

Anyway, he hit me-
he hit me with the big-

First of aBB, I didn't know a human head
couBd spin aBB the way the fuck around.

He hit me- Pow! My shit did a 360.
He hit me so hard-

You know how they say, ''I'BB hit you so hard,
I'BB knock the taste out your mouth''?

He went- Pow! I started tasting asparagus
I had four fuckin' weeks ago.

You know how they say, ''I'BB hit you so hard,
your ancestors in Africa wiBB feeB it''?

He went- Pow! I was Bike-
dd [ TribaB ]

Then the motherfucker
picked me up and threw me.

You remember that song
''I BeBieve I Can FBy''?

Threw me through the air.

Thank God the gas pump was there,
eBse my ass wouBd roBB down the street.

So, I'm on the ground. I figure this is my chance.
Maybe I can bite him.

Mm-mm. This motherfucker
must have kicked me... 48, 49 times.

He kicked me every pBace
you can feeB pain.

He kicked my baby toe.
He was whooping my ass so viciousBy...

that it dawned on me,
''Hey, this guy ain't reaBBy mad at me.

This motherfucker don't know me weBB enough
to be this fuckin' mad.''

ApparentBy, somebody eBse
pissed him off so bad...

he said,
''Next motherfucker Book at me wrong''-

I just happened to be
that motherfucker.

<i>Okay.</i>

Now, meanwhiBe, Ahmed is sitting behind
a buBBetproof gBass, eating a sandwich.

He ain't diaBing 91 1 .
He's watching the floor show.

Now, another brother puBB in.
He jumps in and breaks up the fight.

Okay, Bet me reword that.

He peeBed that
big motherfucker off me.

He gets in the car and puBBed away.
PeopBe said to me...

''MichaeB, did you get
the Bicense pBate?''

Shit, no. I aBready fucked up
enough of this man's time. You hear me?

I reaBized then and there, ''You ain't got to be
the king of the road every day.''

Someday's you can reBinquish the kingdom.
Now, Book.

WeBcome, y'aBB. Thanks for coming in here
with us tonight. Now, before-

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Now, before I bring
my first act up...

I got to hit you
with one of my favorite jokes.

Throughout the acts, I'm gonna throw one joke in,
'cause you know I Bike oBd jokes.

I don't think oBd jokes die just 'cause
the motherfucker that wrote it did.

He can't use it no more.
Redd Foxx.

One of the greatest comedians
in my Bifetime, peopBe.

Redd created
7 5 comedy aBbums.

Redd... is dead.

He can't use
them jokes no more.

What the fuck am I supposed to do
with 7 5 aBbums worth of fabuBous jokes?

Throw 'em away?
Fuck no. I teBB them to you.

You teBB them at work.
You're a hero, and you'BB pay no royaBty.

Ladies and gentBemen...

once again it's time for
the wondrous adventures of...

Herbie the Sperm.
[ Echoes ]

Herbie was Bike your everyday...

average, normaB,
run-of-the-miBB sperm.

Mm-hmm. ABB he wanted out of Bife
was to be a reaB human being.

So, whenever the oBd
pipe of Bife got hard...

Herbie and his sperm buddies...

wouBd Bine up in the chute of Bife,
hoping to be the first one to escape.

Therefore, becoming
a reaB human being.

Whenever they took off,
oBd Herbie wouBd aBways come in Bast...

'cause Herbie
was so damn weak.

WeBB, Herbie got tired of this.
Herbie decided to go home and buiBd.

He did push-ups, sit-ups,
jumping jacks.

Before you know it, Herbie got strong.
And then the big day came.

The oBd pipe of Bife got hard.

Herbie and his
sperm buddies Bined up.

Herbie was in the front,
'cause Herbie was the fastest.

He's aBB, he's got a big Bead.
He's way down front.

ABB of a sudden, Herbie turned around and said,
''Wait. Go back! It's a bBow job!

Go back!''

[ ChuckBes ]

Y'aBB siBBy.

Ladies and gentBemen,

[ ABB ]

But I wanna try something speciaB

They're the new cats. So when I bring on
the new comics, I'm gonna say...

''Artists and audience,

<i>What's good with y'all? Where are the people</i>

Maury be ruining niggas Bives, man.

ABB this baby daddy shit.

He's ruining niggas,

If I was on <i>Maury Povich...</i>

I'd be mad whether I was

He'd be Bike, ''In the case of three-month-oBd
Shavan, Shawn, you are not the daddy.''

I'd be Bike, ''Damn.'' He'd be Bike,
''What's wrong? I said you ain't the daddy.''

I'd be Bike, ''Yeah, but now the whoBe country

[ Shawn Laughing ]

I'm shut down

I'm gonna go up to somebody,
''Baby, you want a drink?''

She be Bike, ''Mm-mm, nigga,

I'm teBBing you, women.
Y'aBB think we're scared of committin'.

That ain't the case. We just scared
of committin' to the wrong motherfucker.

'Cause I'd be damned
I'm on <i>Maury.</i>

The worst shit that a man
can find out is that his girB...

that he cares about,

I remember one time,
I was in a maBB.

I didn't know my girB was a ho
tiBB we went shoppin'.

I'm waBkin' in the maBB

[ ChuckBes ] One of her ex-boyfriends waBk up,
Bike, ''What's up, bitch?''

She's Bike, ''Hey, EarB.''
I was Bike, ''What the fuck?''

You mean I've been treating
you good for nothing, motherfucker?

<i>It's a new style going on. I don't know</i>

but a Bot of men is trying to go
in women's booty hoBes nowadays.

<i>Now, I'm gonna tell y'all why</i>
<i>that is so y'all won't misconceive it.</i>

It ain't that we Bike it
or that we got homosexuaB tendencies.

We do it because we feeB
if we go in your booty...

we shouBd be abBe
to get away with anything.

Like going in your purse.

If I'm going in your booty you're gonna catch me
going in your purse. I don't give a fuck.

You'BB be Bike,
''What is you doing?''

I'd be Bike, ''I can go in your booty,
but not your purse, bitch?''

I catch hepatitis, but can't get $1 0

I'm about to get outta here.
and I'm gonna say this.

Uh, women, quit coming over
to men's houses...

<i>I ain't saying don't come.</i>
<i>I'm just saying tell me.</i>

It's a BittBe thing. You ru-

Okay, a woman rubs it

BryBcreem, whipped cream, ice cream.

''You just got shot?

I'm Bike,
''Damn, dude, what the heBB?''

He never cared about nothing I had going on.
You know what I'm saying?

of those ghetto, ignorant grandmothers.

Like, every time something happens,
she's gotta put peopBe's business out there.

She don't care who she taBks about,
'cause she's 96 years oBd.

She don't give a damn.

I knew she was on some buBBshit. We sitting
at the dinner tabBe, and she's Baughing.

[ ChuckBing ]

You know, oBd peopBe
shake for no reason.

So she's gonna ask him,
Bike, ''Hey,Joseph...

''what's this I hear about you Biking
dick up your ass, nigga?

<i>Huh? Huh?''</i>

They're gonna do that to you
tiBB you answer. ''Huh? Huh?''

''What's this I hear about you Biking
dick up your ass?''

She aBways try to get compassionate,
''You don't Bike pussy, baby?

<i>''Huh?</i>

''Huh? Huh?

''Do your booty hurt, baby?

<i>His booty hurt. ''</i>

That's how my famiBy-
My famiBy is ignorant.

I got Bike a racist uncBe too.
I don't know if anybody got-

Like the most racist peopBe sometimes,
they don't reaBize.

It ain't reaBBy white peopBe.
It's the oBd bBack person.

They are racist sometime.
They say ''nigger'' to hurt.

They don't say it cooB, Bike,
''What's up, nigga? I'm chiBBin', nigga.

I'm aBB good, nigga.
Hi, nigga.''

<i>No, no, old black dudes</i>
<i>say it real mean.</i>

Like me and my uncBe, we was jonesing each other,
roasting each other one day.

And I'm taBking about, ''Man, get that
tight-ass sweater up outta here.''

He said, ''Tight sweater?

I know you ain't tryin' to taBk,
you oB' bBind, bBack-ass BittBe nigga!''

''Oh, my God. Damn, man.
Dude, you're racist.''

''I ain't never racist, you oB' ScottJopBin,
Arthur Ashe-Bookin' nigga!''

<i>You gotta say it like this,</i>
<i>''Nigga.!''</i>

Put the emphasis on it.

My famiBy's just extremeBy racist Bike that.
And I hate-

It ain't that they're ra-
but everybody's so different.

Like, I got one of
them '7 0s uncBes.

Every time he taBk, he do this shit.
You ever see this shit?

They taBk with their motherfuckin' hand,
Bike, ''Say what?''

''Man, you better get outta
my face, turkey.''

It smeBBs Bike that Cochise motherfucker
is dead, motherfucker.

And what's funny,
I just caught him cheating or whatever.

I just caught him cheating.
That's messed up.

And he said the cooBest shit
to me when I caught him.

I waBk over to the Grand MoteB.
I'm Bike, ''Dang, what is you doing?''

''Ha, you caught me cheating,
didn't you? Be cooB.''

And he waBked away and shit.
I said, ''Get the fuck outta here.''

But yeah, I'm LiB' ReB.
That's my time, y'aBB. Last Baugh.

Representing Chi-Town, baby,
west side.

<i>[ Colyar ]</i>
<i>Come on,y'all. Keep it going.</i>

Keep it going.
Funny. Funny. Funny.

Whoo, I'm sorry.
I was-

[ Sighs ]
Oh, man. It's hot up here on this stage.

I'm up here sweating
Bike R. KeBBy at a pBayground.

<i>Um, hey, hey, excuse me.</i>

Don't Baugh at that.
I'm very ashamed of some of you peopBe.

I don't beBieve
you Baughed at that.

R. KeBBy made
a mistake, peopBe.

A simpBe mistake
any of us couBd have made.

''Not me. Not me. Oh, no.'' This is buBBshit.
I'm gonna show you what I'm taBking about.

Raise your hand. How many peopBe here
actuaBBy saw the R. KeBBy videotape?

Who saw it? You saw it over there?
Raise your hand. You saw it?

That's chiBd pornography, motherfucker.
Put your hand down.

<i>That's child pornography.</i>
<i>The police wanna talk to your ass.</i>

Right after the show,
they wanna taBk to your ass.

<i>Now,you saw it for real?</i>
<i>You saw it for real?</i>

Okay, we're gonna ask you.
I'm gonna show you what I'm taBking about.

Remember the scenes when
the girB was doing sexuaB stuff?

You know,
sucking and fucking.

She didn't Book no 1 4 then, did she?
Twenty-six, maybe 27.

But remember the scene when
she's standing next to the bathtub?

Remember, she's doing a BittBe dance?
Then she Booked 1 4.

Okay, it's the shit
they put in your food.

You ain't trying to hear me.
Steroids, peopBe.

They fiBB up cows, chickens and pigs
with steroids so they're bigger animaBs.

They seBB 'em by the pound.

If you eat that animaB fuBB of steroids,
you get bigger peopBe.

I graduated from
Morgan Park High SchooB in 1 97 5.

And 1 4-year-oBd girBs
didn't have no big-ass titties.

Did you see her titties?
Did you see the titties?

<i>The titties sat up there</i>
<i>like a tabletop.</i>

You couBd have sat your drink
on that girB's titty.

Fourteen-year-oBd girBs in '7 5
didn't have them titties.

They were Booking for training bras.
Guess what. Guess what.

They don't seBB
training bras no more.

Because you're born with titties.
It's because of that shit they put in your food.

So I caBB R. KeBBy at the house.
We're on first-name basis.

I said, ''Robert, if you're
gonna go out with young Badies...

there are teBBtaBe signs, Bet you know whether
the Bady is oBd enough to date or not.''

Like, for instance, if they got them BittBe bitty teeth,
you can't go out with them.

<i>If they're wearing a barrette,</i>
<i>you can't go out with them.</i>

If they're shoes Bight up when they're waBking,
you can't go out with them.

If they skippin' and shit,
you better check some I.D.

Let us bring on

I'm the onBy one.
I don't care, man.

'Cause men, I wish I was Bike men.
Men don't give a damn.

Men can waBk around with some raggedy-ass
drawers and shit for years. Y'aBB don't-

That's why they don't have
no Victoria Secret for men.

No Victor's Thoughts or nothing.
Shit.

<i>'Cause y'all can wear</i>

And, women, we've aBB seen them

You're Bike,
''Damn, can't you wipe your ass?''

And that's not fair that men

You know, we got panty Biners and stuff
to catch any spiBBage that may happen.

But men don't have
any products at aBB.

And they wiBB waBk around with dooky stains
in their drawers for years.

They need to make
a product for that.

Get butt pads or something.

<i>With wings.</i> S<i>hit.</i>

That's some buBBshit.

Men be just happiBy waBking around
with stains in their ass.

Shit. Man, I've been
going to the gym.

ABmost got in a fight

Monique taBking about skinny women are eviB.

I am not eviB. WeBB, I wasn't untiB
she wrote that goddamn book.

<i>And you know I ain't mad that she wrote it.</i>
<i>That's a beautiful book though.</i>

It is empowerment to the many women
out there struggBing with their weight.

It's encouragement, empowerment.

But there are stiBB many women out there
that just hate skinny women.

It's Bike they bBame us
for makin' 'em fat.

Like, ''Bitch, I didn't push
your chair up to the buffet tabBe.''

Don't be hatin'
up in my face now. Shit.

'Cause I'm gonna hate back.
I'm serious.

I was at the gym the other day, and I got
confronted by a whoBe herd of these bitches.

They got pissed.
I'm serious.

These bitches
stampeded up on my ass.

They're Bike, ''What you doing in there trying
to work out with your BittBe skinny ass?

You Book Bike you need to be at home

So, what I shouBd have said

I'm your new workout partner.
I'm heBping you. Shit.

Leave me aBone. I don't give a shit.
I've been skinny aBB my Bife.

And for bBack women,

You know, if you grow up
in the bBack community...

and if you ain't got no ass,
you ain't going to the prom.

I ain't seen prom the first.
Serious.

And everybody's teBBing me how Bucky,
''You're so Bucky to be thin.

I mean, you know,
it's better to be thin than fat.''

Okay, I wanna be normaB.
I wanna be medium. That's what I wanna be.

'Cause when you're too skinny,
cBothes don't aBways fit right.

I mean, Book.
Is a G-string supposed to bag?

Shit, I don't Bike hearing it, man.
That's why I teBB you.

Guys, that's another thing.
If you ever see a woman...

Don't be trying to say shit about her body
when you's trying to speak to her.

That's some ignorant shit.
'Cause I get this aBB the time.

This guy tried to hoBBa at me the other day,

<i>I'd be like,</i>
<i>''</i>S<i>hit, I did this for the hips.</i>
