Fire!

Keep to your posts!

Prepare to launch missiles!

Preparing missiles!

It's an earthquake!

Fire into the glacier!

Repeated wars 
and\Nenvironmental disruptions...

As science advanced, earth's\Nenvironment 
paid the ultimate price.

Giant monsters began to appear.

A race of mutants, seemingly human,
\Nemerged as mankind's enemies.

But later joined forces 
with\Nthem to fight the monsters.

The Earth Defense 
Force (EDF) is born.

Possessing special physical abilities,
\Nmore mutants began to appear.

The EDF organized a special military\Nunit 
consisting of humans and mutants.

This elite unit is 
called Organization-M.

But the greatest 
enemy of the EDF...

...plunged the world into\Na 
crisis of extinction.

It appeared for the 
first time in 1954.

It's name is...

Can't maintain this.
 We must surface.

Depth is 6700 meters!

We're already beyond our limit!

Inside temperature now\Nat 
80 degrees Celsius!

Captain!

Temperature now at 90 Celsius!

Captain!
 We can't take anymore!

Manda in pursuit!

Automatic firing system down!

Manda is terminated.

Ship damage at 72%.

Colonel Gordon, were you\Nplanning 
on sinking the Gotengo?

You can't avoid a court 
martial this time.

Enough!

If this was a real fight,
 Ozaki would be dead.

Lucky for you this 
is only an exercise.

Kazama,
 don't get carried away.

But I won the fight.

Listen, the purpose of training is 
not\Nto become stronger than your partner.

Then what's the point?

To become stronger 
than you were yesterday.

Okay.

Ozaki...

Come to my quarters later.

Yes, sir!

Attention!

Wait!

Why did you hold back?

Were you trying to lose?

No. You won.

Listen,
 let me tell you something.

You can't act that way 
during a real fight.

Your gentleness is fatal 
on the battlefield.

How can you protect\Npeople 
without gentleness?

You are overly optimistic.

Don't forget,
 we are Mutants.

We were born not to\Nprotect people,
 but to fight.

It's our mission to attack.

The fossil of an unknown\Nmonster 
was found in Hokkaido...

...and brought to 
the Defense Museum.

A great scholar is coming from\Nthe 
United Nations to examine it.

You'll be the scholar's\Npersonal 
security guard.

Is that all?

Yes.
 It's an easy job.

This isn't a job 
for Organization-M.

The Gotengo is now in dry-dock and 
under\Nrepairs after the battle with Manda.

Col. Gordon was pissed off at 
the\Nconference and hit his superior.

He's in the punishment room.

You need a change of scenery.

Anyhow, this great scholar from the\NUN 
must be an old, argumentative...

Sorry for being 
so argumentative.

This is Ms. Miyuki Otonashi,
\Na molecular biologist.

Are you really a scholar?
\NYou look more like a model.

I always thought Mutants were 
dumb\Ngrunts who only know how to fight.

After meeting you,
 it seems that I was right.

Yeah,
 that's true.

It seems there is also a model\Nwho 
thinks she is a biologist.

First of all,
 let's get something clear.

What?

Don't disturb my job.

Don't talk to me except\Nwhen 
I ask you something.

But I...
\N- In fact...

Don't even look at me except\Nwhen 
you have business with me.

Babysitting a woman.

A job that suits you.

Try a little harder.

I've studied it thoroughly.

A fusion body of machine 
and living creature.

Should I call it 
a cyborg monster?

After full analysis, I'd say 
it's\Napproximately 12,000 years old.

Could such a creation actually\Nbe 
possible 12,000 years ago?

Not possible.
 Not on this planet, at least.

You mean, this monster\Ncame 
from another planet?

Here,
 the M-base is detected.

Yes. Human beings are\Nmade 
up of 4 components:

Adenine, guanine,
 cytosine, and chemin.

But mutants have a fifth unknown\None,
 which we call M-base.

M-base is detected 
in this monster, too.

Mutants is not mutations...

But somehow biologically related 
to\Nthis monster from 12,000 years ago.

That means this monster is 
kind\Nof an ancestor to you guys.

That's ridiculous.

Do you have any special thoughts,
 as the\Nfirst Japanese UN Secretary General?

I believe the human race has\Nthe 
ability to solve any problem.

The logic and science\Nthat 
we brought about...

And the reason and courage to 
solve\Nany mystery mankind encounters.

For example, the root of 
life\Nthat is not yet discovered...

...and overcome any 
and\Nall unknown menaces.

I am convinced that 
such a day is upon us.

Mr. Daigo, are you going\Nto 
New York after this?

Yes.

I'm traveling so much these days,
 I\Nfeel as if I were living on an airplane.

It's a pity I don't see 
Clint\Nvery much these days.

Clint?

Yes.
 He's my dog.

Oh,
 you have a doggy!

He hasn't changed his attitude,
 even\Nsince I became the Secretary General.

Prof. Jiguji,
 here it is.

Infant Island?

This...

That monster's name is Gigan.

Where are we?

Welcome to Infant Island.

We have brought you here to 
tell\Nyou something very important.

Gigan came to this island 12,
000 years\Nago and caused great destruction.

Mothra tried to stop it.

That's what this 
ancient art depicts.

Gigan is a wicked creature.

And its wicked blood 
streams down to you.

Me?

You have the power to 
decide\Nwhat path you will choose.

As long as you don't become an enemy\Nto 
the earth, Mothra is on your side.

What was that?

Did we all have a hallucination?

No.
 It wasn't a hallucination.

Please take this.

This is a charm from 
the\Nancient times of this Island.

Mr. Daigo. Here's 
the\Ndocument for the meeting.

Oh, thank you.

New York is under attack by Rodan.
\NWe've dispatched Rumbling to the scene.

What about Mr.
 Daigo's plane?

It's still missing.

Commander Namikawa,
 Angilas\Nhas appeared in Shanghai!

Dispatch Karyu right away!

Commander!

King Seesar has 
appeared in Okinawa!

Kamakiras is in Paris!

Sydney is under attack!

What on earth?

Damn it!
 Don't let it get the upper hand!

Fire missiles!

Fire Maser!

Don't let it get away!

After it!

Who are you?

I'll shoot!

Who do you think I am?

Grandpa,
 don't shoot him!

He's scared!

Grandpa!

What's going on here?

Damage report!

Captain!

Fire missiles!

Oh,
 you're strong.

There's an energy 
plant 1 KM away.

So we'll stop 'em right here!

Ozaki and Kazama make a team.

You guys blast the 
hell out of him.

Then, while it's 
preoccupied\Nwith the attack...

Ozaki and Kazama will\Nshoot 
it with the masers.

Let's have fried 
shrimp for dinner!

Roger!

Go!

Fire!

We've got it now.

What the hell is happening?

A UFO in Paris!

Kamakiras has disappeared!

Also in Okinawa!
 King\NSeesar has disappeared!

Kumonga as well!

All the monsters 
are disappearing!

The flying objects 
are gathering.

What's the projected 
target area?

Point 0.00.

That's here!

Commander,
 you're in danger here.

I don't care.
 The danger\Nis the same everywhere.

Secretary General Daigo!

What's happening here?

They helped me make 
a narrow escape.

They...?

Yes,
 my friends...

You mean,
 extraterrestrials?

They came from a far-off planet.

They come in peace.

We are all about to bear\Nwitness 
to an historic moment.

Greetings.

Nice to meet you.

We come in peace.

How do we know that?

We've already helped you 
in\Nways you don't yet understand.

The monsters that were ravaging your\Nplanet,
 they're gone now, because of us.

We come from a place 
far\Nbeyond your solar system.

Our intentions are peaceful.

Earthlings cannot 
pronounce\Nthe name of our star.

So,
 you can call it Planet X.

What is your purpose here?

A crisis approaches the earth.

A huge asteroid will 
soon\Ncollide with your planet.

It will collide with the earth in 11,
 736\Nhours, 17 minutes and 32 seconds from now.

31, 30, 29.
 Every second it draws closer.

It is called Gorath.

There is only one way to stop\NGorath 
from destroying your planet.

With our help, you must gather all 
of\Nearth's armaments in one place and attack.

We are all witness to 
these historic events.

This is a great opportunity for us to 
advance\Nin ways we never imagined possible.

With the help of 
our new friends...

We can learn limitless new\Nscience,
 technology and medicine.

This universe has 
now become one.

The days of the United 
Nations are now over.

This is the beginning 
of the Space Nations!

This is an open area in Tokyo\Nwith 
a great view of the UFO.

As for the UFO,
 no one is\Npermitted to approach it...

...as it is now under 
the\Nmanagement of the EDF.

However, look.

A large number of 
people\Ncontinue flocking here...

...day after day,
 to have a look at the X-ians.

The aura of 
enthusiasm escalates!

Today's guest is... not Kenji Kohashi,
\Nbecause he's changed his name.

X.

X? Why X?

It's cool, isn't it.
 I became an X-ian today.

It's a kind of a collaboration between\Nplanets.
 To promote an certain unity...

Okay, okay,
 okay.

I'll just call you Girly-boy.
 That\Nsuits you better, doesn't it?

Yeah, it does.
\N- It sure does!

Isn't it great that 
the\NX-ian are visiting Japan?

Now we want to get reaction\Nfrom 
our celebrity panelists.

First, how about you,
 Mr. Otsuki?

There is something wrong here.

The purpose of an extraterrestrial\Nis 
for earth aggression...

You're what's wrong!

You've always clamed there were 
no\Nextraterrestrials, now here they are! Idiot!

What scientific proof do we have 
that\Nthey're actually from another planet?

You only talk about 
scientific crap and so on.

You're dreaming.
 Wake\Nup and smell the coffee!

This is no dream, and you usually\Nhave 
more constructive things to say.

Thank you!

To finally have direct contact 
with\Nextraterrestrial life is a scientist's dream...

I agree.

This could be a 
great opportunity.

There's no point in denying\Nthat 
they're actually here.

I'm not trying to deny it!
\NIf it is so, I will accept it!

I think we're are all in 
for\Na bad experience soon.

I agree with the 
middle-aged guy.

Soon after Gigan is discovered to 
be\Nfrom another planet, X shows up.

There is no proof of a 
connection\Nbetween Gigan and X.

You need proof,
 do you?

Sister!

Anna Otonashi!
 She's your sister!?

You look good,
 Miyuki.

And you have a cool boyfriend!

Boyfriend!
? No way!

So what proof do you have?

Look carefully.

Yes,
 there's something wrong.

I don't know what,
 but he's weird.

Notice something unusual?

He's not blinking.

It's impossible for 
a human not to blink.

Anyway,
 let's pay him a visit.

Nice to see you again.

Mr. Daigo.

Long time no see 
Secretary General Daigo.

Who are you?

I'm Anna Otonashi of Nitto TV.

I'm in a hurry,
 what can I do for you?

I think your idea about 
the\Nspace alliance is brilliant.

I'd like to pass the message to 
all\Nthe world through our TV program.

Okay,
 I'll get back to you.

Soon,
 if possible!

I don't have any time now.

How's your doggy?

Doggy?

Yes, your dog.

Oh, my dog...

X-ian devil!
 He's an X-ian devil!

He's one of them! We must kill 
them\Nbefore they kill us all! Listen to me!

Mr. Daigo,
 you're bleeding!

Are you all right?
 You should see a doctor.

It's no big deal.

You should get 
emergency first aid...

I said I'm fine!

Miyuki...

This... is not the 
blood of a human being!

I thought so...

There is no creature on 
earth\Nwith this blood composition.

Daigo must be an X alien.

May I come in?

I'm Ozaki,
 second lieutenant.

At ease.
 What is it?

Yes. This is about Mr.
 Daigo.

He has become a major\Nactivist 
for the Space Alliance.

There's a problem?
 Continue.

There has already been\None 
attempt on his life.

I think that we should increase\Nsecurity 
in order to protect him.

I'm aware of all this.
 Thank you.

Yes, ma'am.
 Excuse me.

What is it you want to say?

We have all these monsters and 
can\Nannihilate these people whenever we want.

Why are we wasting 
time like this?

You're still young.

Not every situation is 
to be settled by force.

Sometimes things can 
be handled peacefully.

However,
 if we use our power...

Silence!

About face!

One who relies on power will\Neventually 
fall to a stronger power.

Remember that!

These pictures came from the same time,
\Nbut from a completely different place.

They look exactly the same.

Yes,
 they are the same.

When I put these photos on top of each\Nother,
 there was no difference at all.

This can't be true.
 This must\Nbe some kind of holograph.

You mean,
 Gorath doesn't exist?

This all may be a X-ian plot.

Not only Mr. Daigo,
 but\Nalso Cmdr. Namikawa...

Those two have been\Ntaken 
over by the X aliens?

We can't trust anyone.

There is one 
person we can trust.

Someone I know X aliens 
haven't gotten to.

Col. Gordon.

What do you mean by that?

Hello everyone.

We're broadcasting live 
from the UN building.

We have Secretary General Daigo\Nand 
two X representatives with us.

Thank you for coming.

What are you doing with Mr.
 Daigo's data?

You've become quite 
inquisitive lately.

Major General Kunikida.

If you study too hard,
 you'll\Nknow what needs to be done.

What are you going to\Ndo with me,
 Ms. X alien?

If you know that much,
 then you must die.

You finally show 
your true colors.

Damned humans...

We won't have our plans disrupted\Nby 
such lowly creatures like you!

Are you all right?

Are you?

I'm okay.

Mr. Daigo,
 we have a surprise visitor today.

Oh,
 who is that?

What?
 Have you forgotten?

Oh, that's right!
 That's my dog!

Go and say hello to Mr.
 Daigo.

Mr. Daigo, please call his\Nname.
 He'll be very happy.

Name?

Have you forgotten his name?

Poor thing...

Young lady, please tell\NMr.
 Daigo the dog's name.

Mr.
 Daigo's dog's name is Clint.

Yes, that's right!
 Clint!

Clint,
 come here!

Sorry Clint I couldn't remember\Nyour name.
 How are you, Clint?

He doesn't seem to be in a good mood\Nsince 
I haven't seen him for a long time.

Candy,
 come here Candy!

Your memory must be bad,
 this is my dog.

But you said my dog...

What? I never said 
this is your dog.

This is really fun!

What do you have to say,
 now?

Look at this! This is what\Nan 
X-ian really looks like!

Please explain this!

Well...
 there's...

You see,
 it's like this...

What an interesting 
change of events.

The fun is only just beginning.

I'm the new Controller.

Hello,
 human beings of earth...

Or should I say,
 domesticated animals.

You exist only to 
be dominated by us.

This face isn't too bad 
for\Na domesticated animal.

It is useless for 
you to resist us.

Both our science and 
weaponry\Nare superior to yours.

We have all the monsters\Nunder 
our control as well.

You don't have a chance.

Wait.

Stupid domesticated animals.

You have no idea what 
you're up against.

Kazama!
 What's wrong?

Kazama!

You're also a Mutant.

I leave this for you.

Get out of here.
 I'll handle this.

They need you.
 I'm expendable.

Please save the earth,
 Captain.

Run!

Ozaki?

Gigan, awaken!

Drop all of the 
monsters on earth!

Make these savages feel like 
the\Ndomesticated animals they are.

This is our playground.

Destroy the previous 
civilization!

Don't give up!
 Fight until the last breath!

Captain!
 Angilas is on the right!

What the...!?

Looks like things are 
well under control.

These savages are getting 
their asses kicked.

Useless.

Now what? Kenta,
 let's go!

By the way,
 what's his name?

Minya.
 His name is Minya.

Minya? Okay then.
 Let's\Ngo, Kenta and Minya!

All communication from 
the\Noutside has been cut off.

For some reason, they haven't\Ndiscovered 
this emergency hangar.

How about repairs?
 Is it fixed yet?

Yes. Gotengo is the 
only thing we have left.

You shouldn't move for a while.

Ozaki...

Why didn't you kill me?

Because you're my friend.

They'll find this place sooner or\Nlater!
 We need to attack them!

Ozaki, don't become emotional.
\NGotengo is our last hope.

The South Pole?

Area G...

You want to awaken Godzilla?

It's too dangerous.
 Godzilla\Nwill destroy the world.

But if Godzilla is being 
controlled by them...

That's all right.
 Godzilla doesn't have M-base.

All the X aliens,
 Gigan...

...and part of Ebirah which was\Nstuck 
to Kazama's body have M-base.

And of course,
 all the Mutants, too.

That's right.

The X-ians and the 
monsters\Nhave a common gene...

...which give them 
power to control them.

Then why wasn't I affected?

You're not controlled.
\NThat's the important thing.

If we use Godzilla to 
destroy the enemy...

How do we deal with 
Godzilla afterwards?

It's not that easy...

So,
 what you're saying is...

We fight our way 
to the South Pole.

Blast Godzilla free 
and take him back.

Then have him 
fight the monsters.

Meantime,
 we defeat the X aliens somehow.

Then we go back to the South\NPole 
and confine Godzilla again?

Understood.

Miyuki,
 be careful.

You too, sis.

Please come back alive and well.

Well, there's still an 
interesting toy left.

Gigan, go.

Captain,
 Gigan approaching!

Main engine has stopped!
\NPower circuits have cut off!

Fire missiles!

What is that monster?

I am your enemy.
 And Godzilla's enemy is...

This one!

Here he comes!

Repairs completed!

Start engines!

Godzilla is following us.

Where should we go?

Godzilla,
 let's see how strong you are.

Good for nothing 
tuna eating monster!

Next!

So earth does have 
something strong.

Interesting.

Why is Godzilla 
destroying that town?

Long before you were born,
\Nhumans did a terrible thing...

And made Godzilla very angry.

Terrible thing?

Yes.

You're to young to 
understand yet...

But humans made a huge 
fire\Nthat cause much destruction.

Godzilla never forgot 
the\Nanger he felt at that time.

What's the matter?

Hey,
 what's wrong?

What are you doing?

Are you okay?

In the end, all of 
my\Nresearch was meaningless.

We can now control 
our own destiny.

Your contributions will be\Nneeded again.
.. after the war.

Hey, how come you're 
still fighting?

Even though you know 
there's no chance.

I was assigned to protect you.
 That's my job.

Hey, Minya,
 where are we going?

Now what will you do,
 Godzilla?

What are you doing?

What's the matter,
 Minya?

You've finally arrived.

Masers launched!

One of the jet 
fighters have launched.

I owe you a debt.

What are you doing?

It's suicide!

Wait!

I leave the rest to you,
 Ozaki.

Stop! Kazama!

Coming into our 
place by drilling...

You're such rude 
domesticated animals.

Kill the useless animals.

Well, everything is 
pretty much cleaned up.

Take them.

Just a moment.

It's no good.

Earthlings,
 do you understand our power?

We must take a certain 
mitochondria\Nfrom your cells to survive.

In other words,
 we must harvest you alive.

Harvest us alive?

At first, we destroyed your civilization 
so\Nthat you didn't realize our true intentions.

We will be harvesting 
a new crop soon.

You can live here like 
a domesticated animal.

This is our ranch and you are\Nthe 
animals awaiting slaughter.

You're not funny.

Both civilization and\Nscience 
are useless to you.

You are doomed by your own 
destruction\Nand history of massacre anyway.

We will rule over you so 
that\Nwill never happen again.

By the way, it's almost\Ntime 
for the main event!

Together we will all 
witness\Nthe last of Godzilla.

Godzilla isn't 
all that powerful.

Another nuisance.

Your enemy is a new,
 more powerful Gigan!

How are you going 
to defeat us now?

How should I kill our friends?

Friends?

X-ians and Mutants are\Nthe same,
 isn't that right?

M-base was also 
discovered in X-ian blood.

We're not the same.
 We have\Nplenty of M-base on our planet.

M-base is a material 
influenced\Nby telepathic ability.

Therefore Mutants can be\Ncontrolled,
 as well as Gigan.

You're bright for an earthling.

Mutants are descendants 
of our ancestors.

But unfortunately,
 you couldn't control me.

You're an exception.
 Your power\Nhasn't been developed enough.

What?

You're a Kaiser.

A Mutant that is half 
earthling half X-ian.

The odds of such a creature\Nbeing 
born are on in thousands.

You and I have one 
thing is common...

We're both Kaisers.

You have the ability to 
surpass\Nboth human and X-ian.

Ozaki!

Wake up,
 Kaiser!

Kaiser, as a start,
 kill them all.

No! Don't!

I...

This is boring.
 We should\Nkill these useless ones.

Keep your eyes on them.

This is our planet.

Secretary General Daigo!

Ms. Otonashi!

You're all okay!

I managed to escape 
from them by myself.

They used to call me "Mr.
 Infallible."

Captain,
 please get everyone out of here.

His ass is mine.

You wouldn't hit a lady.

How many times must I tell you?

You only exist to be ruled.
.. as pets.

My existence...

The only one who could\Ndecide 
my existence is me.

We are not domesticated animals.

We are human beings.

You are a fool to support these 
animals\Nwhile having the power to control all!

I won't die alone!

You're not taking me with you!

Cmdr. Namikawa!

Let's go!

Pull that lever!
 Hurry up!

Pull the lever 
with all your might!

It's sucking the life 
force out of Godzilla.

If only we can give 
power to Godzilla...

All systems negative!

What's that!?

Hey Godzilla,
 you've done\Nenough, haven't you?

Damn you!

What are you doing?

Minya!

Welcome back!

Everything is finally over.

No,
 a new war as begun...
