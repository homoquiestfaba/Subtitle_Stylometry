WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, AN INVITATION? YOUâ€™RE LATE.

Iâ€™M SORRY.

JUST CLOSE THE DOOR.

[DOOR CLOSES]

HEY, UH, URSULA. CAN I USE YOUR REST ROOM?

ITâ€™S OVER THERE TO THE RIGHT.

[WATER RUNNING]


[SHOWER DRIPPING]

NEXT WEEK?

UM, WEâ€™LL SEE.

CALL ME. WEâ€™LL FIGURE IT OUT.

WELL, YOU GOTTA GO NOW. MY HUSBANDâ€™S GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

BYE.

AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS VERY EXCITING.


FIVE FULL DAYS, FOUR NIGHTS, WITH STEVEN SOMMERS.

FROM NEW YORK CITY.

NOW, LETâ€™S OPEN UP THE BIDS HERE.

LETâ€™S START IT AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

DO I HEAR 50,000? [CLAPPING, CHEERING]

$50,000! WEAK.

DO I HEAR 55,000? 55,000, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...


COME ON, LADIES...

MY NAME IS STEVEN SOMMERS, AND Iâ€™M ON THE AUCTION BLOCK.

DO I HEAR 60? $60,000?

IN A DIFFERENT ATTEMPT AT FINDING A SOUL MATE,

I HAD A FRIEND SUCKER ME INTO PUTTING MYSELF UP FOR A BID

AT A CHARITY BENEFIT TO HELP CHILDREN WITH CANCER.

$60,000!

OKAY, SO YOUâ€™RE PROBABLY THINKING, WHY PUT MYSELF THROUGH THAT?

WHY NOT JUST GIVE MONEY TO THE CHARITY, AND CALL IT A DAY?

$65,000! BUT THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS THAT Iâ€™LL FIND A SOUL MATE.

FIVE. AND HAPPINESS WILL FOLLOW.


OKAY, SO Iâ€™M ROMANTICIZING THE WHOLE DEAL.

BUT WHATâ€™S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?

HEREâ€™S YOUR DRINK, MAâ€™AM. THANK YOU.


Iâ€™D MEET A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, WHO PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR ME.

SPEND FIVE DAYS AND FOUR NIGHTS WITH HER.

FOR STEVEN SOMMERS... AND HAVE AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

DONâ€™T DISAPPOINT... AND MOVE ON.

A GOOD, WORTHY CHARITY.

BOY, WAS I WRONG. A HUNDRED THOUSAND! THE BLONDE OVER THERE!

FANTASTIC!

THE LADY TO THE FRONT... THE BLONDE LADY...

PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUâ€™RE OBVIOUSLY A VERY GIVING PERSON.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTRIBUTING.

OH, HOW CLUMSY OF ME. Iâ€™LL PICK THAT UP FOR YOU.

THANK YOU.


GOING TWICE...

SOLD, TO THE LADY OVER THERE, THERE YOU GO.

SHOW YOU FACE, LADY. EXCELLENT.

THANKS FOR CONTRIBUTING FOR THE CHILDREN WITH CANCER.

AND THIS IS FOR YOU. UH, I...

I CANâ€™T TAKE THIS.


BLONDE LADY. PLEASE COME FORWARD.

YOUâ€™RE OBVIOUSLY A VERY GIVING PERSON.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTRIBUTING

TO THE FOUNDATION OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

I CANâ€™T TAKE THIS.

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?

[AUDIENCE JEERING, LAUGHING]

HEY, DAVID!

WHAT KIND OF A JOKE IS THIS?

A VERY EXPENSIVE ONE.

I CANâ€™T JUST LEAVE WITH A GUY AND BE AT HIS BECK AND CALL FOR FIVE DAYS.

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HIM?

WHATEVER COMES NATURAL.

NOTHING COMES NATURAL, Iâ€™M NOT INTO IT.

STEVEN, THAT LADY JUST PAID $100,000 FOR YOU.

SHE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO WITH HER WINNINGS,

AND THAT INCLUDES GIVING IT TO THE WAITER.

THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

SUCK IT UP FOR THE CHILDREN WITH CANCER, OKAY?

ITâ€™S ONLY FIVE DAYS, FOUR NIGHTS.

YOU CAN DO IT.


YOU LOOK SCARED. LOOK, Iâ€™M NOT INTO GUYS, OKAY?

THIS WAS... MY NAMEâ€™S JULIAN, WHATâ€™S YOURS?

STEVEN. STEVEN, NICE TO MEET YOU. CARE TO COME IN?

HEY BUDDY, I JUST TOLD YOU. Iâ€™M NOT INTO GUYS.

I DID THIS AS A FAVOR TO A FRIEND, AND OBVIOUSLY IT BACKFIRED ON ME.

LOOK, HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE THIS MONEY AND WEâ€™LL CALL IT A DAY, OKAY?

I BELIEVE Iâ€™VE WON THIS AUCTION.

Iâ€™M SURE Iâ€™M NOT WHAT YOU WANTED,

AND I CERTAINLY DIDNâ€™T EXPECT THIS,

BUT HERE WE ARE.

Iâ€™VE BEEN MADE A FOOL OF.

WELL HEY, IF YOUâ€™RE THAT HORRIFIED

BY THE PREMISE OF HANGING OUT WITH ME,

I SUGGEST WE HAVE A DRINK AND CALL IT A DAY.

YOUâ€™D BE WILLING TO DO THAT?

SO YOU LIVE HERE, HUH?

IS THERE A PROBLEM?

LOOK, MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. Iâ€™M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER.


THAT'S ME AND MY BROTHER, MICHAEL.

WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

CUTE ONE. [CHUCKLES]

NOW, WHO IS THIS?

THATâ€™S MY SISTER ANA.

WELL, I CALL HER MY SISTER.

SHEâ€™S LIKE THE SISTER I NEVER HAD.

WOW, WHEREâ€™S SHE NOW?

AT WORK. SHE WORKS HERE. HERE?

WHAT DOES SHE DO?

SHEâ€™S A HOUSEKEEPER.

THE OWNER OF THE HOTEL WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MY FATHERâ€™S.

AND WE NEEDED A JOB AND HE HELPED US OUT.

WE LIVED SO FAR AWAY,

HE TOOK US IN, GAVE US A PLACE TO STAY WHILE I WORKED,

SO I COULD SEND MONEY TO MY MOM.

WELL, THATâ€™S VERY NICE OF HIM. YEAH.

WHEN MY DAD DIED, THE BILLS PILED UP SO MUCH...

THE BILLS PILED UP SO MUCH THAT...

WE WERE PRACTICALLY ON THE STREETS.

THEN I GOT THIS JOB, STOPPED THE BANK FROM FORECLOSING,

AND HERE I AM.

READY? - FOR... FOR WHAT?

DRINKS? OH, YEAH! OF COURSE.

GO.


[PHONE RINGS]


HELLO? OH, HI, GISELLE!

GIRL, I THOUGHT YOU WAS ON VACATION.

THEY LET YOU OUT THAT QUICK?


NO, BITCH, Iâ€™M COOKING... OOPS.

Iâ€™M MAKING MICHAEL A SPECIAL MEAL.

IT WAS MY MAMAâ€™S SPECIAL DISH?

YOU KNOW, SHE SAID IT KEPT HER MARRIED TO DAD 30 YEARS STRONG.

ITâ€™S CALLED "HOW TO KEEP YOU MAN," SOMETHING YOU NEED TO LEARN..


SHIT. UM, COULD YOU HOLD ON FOR A SECOND?

OKAY.

HELLO. [LAUGHS]

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. Iâ€™M OKAY. OKAY.

I JUST GOT HORRIBLE CRAMPS, TRICK.

NO, NO, I DON'T NEED A DOCTOR, IT'S JUST THAT TIME OF THE MONTH.

NO! RICE AND BEANS, OKAY?

THE OLD FOLKS SAY IT HELP YOU KEEP YOUR MAN, ALL RIGHT?

OH, SHOOT! OKAY, LOOK, LOOK, HEâ€™S COMING. AND LOOK...

LOOK, Iâ€™LL CALL YOU BACK, ALL RIGHT? Iâ€™LL CALL YOU BACK.

ALL RIGHT. GOOD-BYE.

BABY! WHATâ€™S UP, GIRL?


OKAY. DID YOU GET IT? OH, YEAH.

THAT'S GREAT BABY. WHERE'S THE STONES?

RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

OKAY, LET IT GO. WHOO!

YOU CAN DO IT. THANK YOU!

AH, THAT SMELLS GREAT. OH, YES.

RICE AND BEANS, OKAY? MY MAMAâ€™S SPECIAL RECIPE.

IT'LL BE READY IN JUST A MINUTE NOW. DAMN.

ITS BEEN FOREVER SINCE I HAD SOME OF THAT.

[SNIFFS, GIGGLES] ONE SECOND. JEEZ.

OH.

OKAY. DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS?

OH, NO. IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.

GOOD. GOOD.

OKAY... ACTUALLY... OH, YEAH.

OH, THAT IS... [CHUCKLES]

HOPE YOUâ€™RE HUNGRY. I AM.

RIGHT.

EAT UP, EAT UP. OH, YEAH. SURE.

[CLEARS THROAT] HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

ITâ€™S GREAT. YOUâ€™RE AWESOME, SWEETHEART! COME HERE.

OH... [KISSING]

I KNEW YOUâ€™D LIKE IT. I CAN COOK. YEAH.

DONâ€™T GET IT TWISTED. [LAUGHS]

TEA, COFFEE? COFFEE. BLACK.

THANK YOU.

WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES?

I HAD TO DROP THEM OFF AT THE DRY CLEANERS,

â€™CAUSE THERE WAS PUKE ALL OVER THEM.

THEY WERE STINKING UP THE APARTMENT.

SO, WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I PASSED OUT?

I... TOOK YOU OUT OF THE LOUNGE...

BROUGHT YOU HOME, AND WE WENT TO BED.

LOOK, I GOTTA GO TO WORK IN A LITTLE BIT, BUT YOUâ€™RE WELCOME TO STAY.

I DONâ€™T THINK SO.


NO, NO. WE HAD A DEAL.

YOUâ€™RE RIGHT. WE HAD A DEAL.

BY THE WAY, ON YOUR WAY OUT, DONâ€™T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.

AND YOUâ€™RE WELCOME TO WEAR SOME OF MY CLOTHES UNTIL YOURS ARE READY.

[TV ANNOUNCER]

HEY. - HEY.

YOUâ€™RE STILL HERE.

YEAH.

WHY?

LOOK, THE DRY CLEANER WAS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED...

PLUS, I WAS THINKING SOMEBODY PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR A GOOD CAUSE,

AND...

I SHOULD HONOR THAT.

YOU KNOW YOU DONâ€™T HAVE TO.

YEAH, I KNOW.

I MEAN, ITâ€™S PERFECTLY FINE IF YOU JUST...

NO, Iâ€™M A MAN OF MY WORD.

NOW, GRANTED, THE SEX OF THE WINNER WAS A LOT DIFFERENT

FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD, BUT...

STILL FOUR DAYS LEFT.

SO, WHAT NOW?

Iâ€™LL GO SEE IF YOUR CLOTHES ARE DONE.

THANK YOU.

WELL, I HAD A GREAT TIME.

ME TOO.

WELL, I THINK Iâ€™LL GO UP TO MY ROOM NOW.

I PRACTICALLY FORGOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UP THERE.

WELL, GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT.

I NEED A DRINK.

I HOPE YOU LIKE RED WINE. I LOVE IT.

HEY, YOU KNOW, Iâ€™D LIKE TO MEET YOUR SISTER ANA SOMETIME.

YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE.

HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

BECAUSE SHE WORKS ON THIS FLOOR.

I DON'T THINK SHE'S CLEANED HERE YET.

[CLEARS THROAT] YOU KNOW WHAT? ITâ€™S GETTING LATE.

I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

YOUâ€™RE RIGHT. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SUGGEST THE SAME THING.

WELL, THANKS FOR BRINGING THE WINE.

THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME DRINK IT.


YES, COME, COME. THANK YOU. BYE-BYE.

YOUâ€™RE NOT FIRING ME, ARE YOU?

THAT SPILL LAST WEEK WASNâ€™T MY FAULT!

NO, NO, NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

UM, JULIAN...

UM...

YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY THIS MORNING.

I GOT A PHONE CALL.

FROM A... A LADY.

WINNIE... WINNIE, UH, McKINSEY?

YOUR MOTHERâ€™S NEIGHBOR?

SHE ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU THE MESSAGE.

Iâ€™M SORRY, JULIAN. I WISH I HAD BETTER NEWS.

TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED.

YOU SURE?

YEAH, JULIAN. Iâ€™M SURE.

SHEâ€™S DEAD. MY MOM.


SHEâ€™S DEAD!

OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD.



[PHONE RINGING]


HELLO? JULIAN?

MICHAEL DOESNâ€™T HAVE ANY BROTHERS!

YOU MUST HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER, OKAY? SORRY!



HELLO? WELL, DIDNâ€™T I JUST TELL YOU?...

YES.

MICHAEL ISNâ€™T HERE RIGHT NOW.

OKAY. I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

[CLATTERING, RUMBLING]

WHAT'S WRONG?

SOMEONE BY THE NAME OF JULIAN CALLED FOR YOU THIS MORNING.

I DIDNâ€™T KNOW YOU HAD A BROTHER.

WELL, I DO.

YOU NEVER TOLD ME! I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

SO, WHAT DID HE SAY?

BABY, YOUR MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING.

AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT SOME SUITCASE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

ANYTHING ELSE?

BABY, I'M SORRY... WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

NOTHING! YOUâ€™RE HURTING ME.

Iâ€™M SORRY.

LISTEN, BABY, WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY? Iâ€™M NOT GOING.

COME, YOUâ€™RE JUST HURTING... Iâ€™M NOT GOING!

BUT YOUR BROTHER... HEâ€™S NOT MY FUCKING BROTHER, OKAY?

OKAY. WELL, JULIAN

SAID THAT YOUR MOTHER LEFT YOU A SUITCASE FOR BOTH OF YOU,

AND WHATEVERâ€™S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TO THE BODY IS IN THERE.

OKAY?

I OWE MAYA A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW.

NOWâ€™S NOT A GOOD TIME FOR ME.

LISTEN BABY. WEâ€™LL TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED.

HE'LL UNDERSTAND, OKAY? WE'LL PAY HIM LATER.

HEâ€™S A DRUG DEALER.

HE COULDNâ€™T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT US. WE CANâ€™T PAY HIM LATER.

HE WANTS HIS MONEY NOW.

BABY, HOW LONG HAVE WE KNOWN HIM? HUH?

NOT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE US A BREAK.

THAT'S IT! WE'RE GOING. GET YOUR STUFF!

JUST LIKE THAT? JUST A MINUTE AGO, YOU DIDNâ€™T...

GET YOUR STUFF. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. HE NEEDS THIS SUITCASE.

OH. SO YOUâ€™RE STEVEN.

HEâ€™S NOT IN.

JULIANâ€™S TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT YOU.

WHERE IS HE?

UM, HIS MOM PASSED AWAY OVER THE WEEKEND.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HIM?

YEAH. HE WENT HOME.

HE'S AT HIS MOMâ€™S HOUSE.

THANK YOU.

Iâ€™M SORRY, JULIAN.

Iâ€™M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT, JULIAN.

SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER LEFT.

I KNOW.

SHE REALLY MISSED YOU BOTH, BUT DEEP DOWN,

I KNOW SHE KNEW IT WAS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST FOR BOTH OF YOU TO LEAVE.

I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER ALONE.

DON'T BLAME YOURSELF, SON. THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

WHERE IS SHE NOW?

RIGHT NOW, HER BODY IS BEING PROCESSED AT THE MORGUE.

CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF TEA?

NO THANK YOU, MRS. WINNIE.

ITâ€™S A GOOD THING YOUR MOTHER LEFT ME WITH SPARE KEYS,

AND YOUR NUMBER.

SHE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER.

SHE DID? OH, YES.

SHE WAS SO PROUD OF YOU BOTH.

I KNOW.

YOU MUST BE TIRED.

IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, Iâ€™LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

ARE YOU SURE YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE OKAY HERE, BY YOURSELF?

YEAH, Iâ€™M POSITIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

YOU KNOW, REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY,

AND YOUâ€™D GO OUT IN THE BACKYARD

AND DIG UP WORMS AND THEN, GIVE THEM A RIDE ON YOUR TRIKE?

AND THEN THE DAY THAT I ASKED YOU,

"JULIAN, WHEREâ€™S TOBY AT?"

YOU SAID, "HEâ€™S RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET,"

AND YOU PULLED HIM OUT AND HE SNAPPED IN HALF?

AND THEN DID WE DID THE FUNERAL. [LAUGHING]

WE DID A FULL FUNERAL FOR HIM.

YOU MADE HIM A LITTLE HEADSTONE.

OH SON... I LOVE YOU, MOM.



WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

ANA TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. Iâ€™M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.

I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME COMPANY... OR EVEN HELP.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

NO, I WANT TO.

YOU HAVE TO LEAVE ME OUT HERE WITH MY BAGS?

NO. COME IN, PLEASE.

NICE PLACE.

SO THIS IS WHERE YOU GREW UP.

YEAH. YOU KNOW, Iâ€™M SORRY. I JUST ARRIVED MYSELF.

AND I DONâ€™T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER YOU.

DONâ€™T WORRY ABOUT IT.

SO...

SO...

WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY STUFF?

YOU CAN STAY IN MY BROTHER MICHAELâ€™S ROOM.

WELL, ISNâ€™T HE COMING?

I DONâ€™T KNOW, BUT FOR NOW YOU CAN STAY THERE.

WHO ARE YOU? Iâ€™M STEVEN. YOU MUST BE MICHAEL.

REALLY? HMM.

THIS IS CHANEL. SHEâ€™S MY GIRLFRIEND.

I'M A FRIEND OF YOUR BROTHER. Iâ€™M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.

IS HE IN? YEAH.

YOU KNOW, I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO THE STORE.

DO YOU NEED ANYTHING? YEAH. WE COULD USE...

UH, NO, WEâ€™RE FINE! OKAY, SEE YOU IN A BIT.


YEAH.

HEY. WHATâ€™S UP?

YOU MADE IT.

UH, THIS IS CHANEL, MY GIRLFRIEND.

SHE GONNA BE STAYING WITH ME.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

Iâ€™LL HAVE TO MOVE MY FRIENDâ€™S STUFF OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

I DIDNâ€™T THINK YOU WERE COMING. [CHANEL] WHERE WILL HE STAY?

HE CAN CRASH IN MY ROOM. Iâ€™M SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.

OH, OKAY.

BUT, UH, I WAS JUST PREPARING SOMETHING TO EAT.


OKAY. Iâ€™LL GO MOVE HIS LUGGAGE.

I GOT IT.

HOW ARE YOU DOING, BABY? Iâ€™M GOOD.

HOPE YOU LIKE PEANUT BUTTER. SOUNDS GREAT.

SO HOWâ€™D YOU GUYS GET HERE?

WE HITCHED A RIDE.

YEAH, YOU KNOW YOUR BROTHERâ€™S CRAZY.


SO HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING FOR?

NOT LONG. I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.

WHERE DO YOU WORK?

WITH A BUDDY AT HIS SHACK.

ACTUALLY, HEâ€™S A FRIEND OF MINE.

MICHAELâ€™S DOING SALES FOR HIM. MY BABY.

NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN HOLD A JOB.

DON'T START WITH ME! BOYS, COME ON! OKAY?

LOOK, AT SOME POINT, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE SUITCASE.

YOU BROUGHT IT WITH YOU, RIGHT?

YEAH, I DID.

ALL RIGHT, WELL... COME ON, EAT UP.

SO WHAT'S UP WITH YOU AND STEVEN?

OH, HE'S JUST A FRIEND WHAT ABOUT ANA?

SHE COULDNâ€™T MAKE IT. SHE HAD TO WORK.

WHO IS ANA?

THATâ€™S JULIANâ€™S GIRLFRIEND.

I THOUGHT YOU WAS GAY?

SHE'S A CHILDHOOD FRIEND.

SO IS STEVEN YOUR BOY?

NO. STEVENâ€™S ACTUALLY STRAIGHT.


WELL, HE SAYS HE IS, SO I BELIEVE HIM.

SO WHAT, YOU INTO STRAIGHT MEN NOW?

YOU CAN TELL ME. I GOT A COUSIN WHO'S GAY. IT'S COOL.

ENOUGH OF THE GAY TALK. I'M EATING.

OH, Iâ€™M SORRY. I ALMOST FORGOT, YOUR BROTHER IS HOMOPHOBIC.

Iâ€™M SORRY, IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD A BROTHER?

I'M DONE.

HE NEVER COULD GET PAST THAT.

NOW I SEE WHY HE NEVER MENTIONED YOU.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SEEM LIKE YOU GOT IT ALL TOGETHER.

DONâ€™T PAY HIM NO MIND, OKAY? YOU BE WHO YOU ARE.

BUT. YOUâ€™VE GOT TO TELL ME WHATâ€™S GOING ON WITH YOU AND STEVEN.

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M NOT SURE. I MEAN, WE JUST MET,

THEN THIS HAPPENED AND...

I DONâ€™T KNOW, HE JUST SHOWED UP. YEAH?

MAYBE HE DOES LIKE ME. MAYBE?

WELL, I THINK SO, OR ELSE HE WOULDNâ€™T BE HERE.

WHAT, ARE YOU BLIND? CANâ€™T SEE WHATâ€™S RIGHT IN YOUR EYES?


HEY. HEY.

I HAVE TO GO TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO WITH YOU? SURE.

Iâ€™LL DRIVE YOU. ALL RIGHT.

WELCOME TO CASKETS FOR LESS.

SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

WE HAVE CASKETS OF EVERY COLOR.

THIS ONE IS SKY BLUE.

OVER HERE IS CHERRY...

IN A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL CHAMPAGNE GRAY.

OVER HERE IS MY FAVORITE. THIS IS BLACK AND SILVER.

WE BASICALLY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WOULD DESCRIBE THE NEEDS OF YOUR LOVED ONE.

TELL ME, WHAT WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN?

CAN I JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THEM ALL?

OH. BE MY GUEST.

Iâ€™LL BE IN MY OFFICE IN THE BACK.

ITâ€™S THROUGH THOSE DOORS. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

THANK YOU.

YOU COME BACK AND SEE US, OKAY?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

YEAH. SORRY.

Iâ€™M READY TO GO.

ARE YOU SURE YOUâ€™RE HOLDING UP OKAY?

YEAH, Iâ€™M POSITIVE.

BY THE WAY, ON THE WAY HOME,

WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME AT MRS. WINNIEâ€™S HOUSE?

SHEâ€™S OUR NEIGHBOR, AND SHE LOOKED AFTER MY MOM,

AND Iâ€™D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

YEAH, SURE. NO PROBLEM.

HELLO? HELLO? [TV CHATTERING]

OH. HEY, STEVIE BABY.

OH. SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

UM... UH...

HOW'S JULIAN DOING?

HEâ€™S FINE.

ARE YOU HIGH?


SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME A LITTLE GROGGY. THAT'S ALL.

SO YOU SAID JULIAN IS DOING FINE, HUH? YEAH.

GOD, YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I DO WORRY ABOUT HIM.

SO WHATâ€™S UP WITH YOU? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?


I MEAN, HOW DOES SOMEONE WHO IS NOT GAY...

SHOW UP AT THE GAY PERSONâ€™S HOUSE, OKAY,

TO HELP DOING HIS MOURNING, AND LOOK, YOU DONâ€™T HAVE TO BULLSHIT WITH ME.

I KNOW WHATâ€™S UP.

SO. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? NOTHING.

I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM THROUGH ALL OF THIS. ITâ€™S CALLED BEING HUMAN.

I REMEMBER WHEN MY MOM DIED.

IT WAS VERY HARD ON ME,

AND BACK THEN, I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO LEND ME MORAL SUPPORT.

UH-HUH. SO DO YOU HAVE THE HOTS FOR HIM?

WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? I'M STRAIGHT.


LISTEN, I KNOW. MY RADAR WORKS VERY WELL.

DO YOU WANT ME TO PROVE IT TO YOU?

I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

HEY, YOU WANT A BUMP?

NO, NO, NO. I STOPPED DOING THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

COME ON, MAN. JUST ONE BUMP. DONâ€™T BE A NERD, OKAY?

BUMP. ALRIGHT, JUST ONE.

[SNIFFS DEEPLY]

MM. HERE YOU GO.

COME ON!

ATTA BOY. [LAUGHING]

THATâ€™S IT?



SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

SHE ALWAYS LEFT A LIGHT ON. THATâ€™S HOW I KNEW THAT SHE WAS HOME.

I STOPPED BY AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.

I ENTERED USING THE SPARE KEY SHE GAVE ME.

THE TELEVISION WAS ON.

THE LIGHTS WERE ON.

WHEN I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN, THATâ€™S WHERE I FOUND HER.

[TV CHATTER]

[TV OFF]

HOW YOU FEELING, STEVIE BABY?

OH, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULDNâ€™T HAVE DONE THIS.

OH, COME ON, YOU WERE JUST HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

SO, HOW DO I KNOW YOU STRAIGHT?

I JUST AM, OKAY?

YES, BUT HOW DOES CHANEL KNOW?

WHY? ARE YOU INTERESTED?

I DONâ€™T KNOW. MAYBE.

WHO GAVE YOU THAT NAME, ANYWAY?

ITâ€™S MY REAL NAME. ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY MOTHERâ€™S FAVORITE PERFUME:

CHANEL NUMBER FIVE.

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

YOUR MOTHER LEFT ONE OF YOU WITH A BRIEFCASE.

YEAH, MICHAEL HAS IT.

IN IT, YOUâ€™LL FIND HER LAST WISHES.

HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU, MRS. WINNIE,

FOR TAKING CARE OF HER WHILE I WAS GONE?

YOU DONâ€™T NEED TO. YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LIFETIME.

SHEâ€™S UP THERE, LOOKING AT US.

SMILING.

Iâ€™VE KNOWN YOUR MOTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE GIRLS.

WE WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOLS TOGETHER,

AND HAVE REMAINED FRIENDS EVER SINCE.

MY HUSBAND, MAY HE REST IN PEACE,

AND YOUR FATHER...

WE ALL GREW UP TOGETHER, AND PRACTICALLY MARRIED AT THE SAME TIME.

WE WERE POOR, BUT WE MADE DO WITH WHAT WE HAD.

AND YOUâ€™LL BE FINE. HANG IN THERE.

AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER A PLANNER,

AND SHE REALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME PLANNING FOR THIS MOMENT.

ITâ€™S GETTING LATE, I GOT TO GO.

ONE MORE THING.

YOUR MOTHER DOES NOT WANT A WHOLE BIG TO-DO AT HER FUNERAL.

SHE ALWAYS MENTIONED TO ME

THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT A CONGREGATION OF STRANGERS AT HER FUNERAL.

SHE ONLY WANTS TO SPEND HER LAST MOMENTS WITH BOTH HER SONS.

GOOD NIGHT, MRS. WINNIE.

GOOD NIGHT, JULIAN. THANK YOU.

SHALOM.

YOU KNOW, YOUâ€™S A GOOD-LOOKING HUNK.

YOU LIKE HOT CHOCOLATE? [CHUCKLES]

MAYBE. WHY DO YOU ASK?

BECAUSE I WANT TO BE YOUR COD BERRY.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND?

HEâ€™S PROBABLY IN THE OTHER ROOM,

STRUNG OUT, PASSED OUT, WHO THE FUCK KNOWS.

BUT WE ARE HERE. HMM?

YOU ARE HERE, Iâ€™M HERE.

SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

MM.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

JULIAN COULD WALK IN ANY MINUTE.



OW! [LAUGHS]

[CRYING OUT]



WAIT, I CAN EXPLAIN.

DON'T SAY A FUCKING THING! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLAIN!

HEY.

WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT?

I HEARD A DOOR SLAM.


WE WERE JUST... WE WERE WATCHING TELEVISION. SO...

WHY WASNâ€™T THE TV ON? BECAUSE...

BECAUSE...

UH, BECAUSE...

EVERYTHINGâ€™S ALL RIGHT. RIGHT?



HOW DID IT GO WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR?

FINE.

MM. WHAT?

YOUâ€™RE SITTING ON MY BED.

[CHANEL LAUGHS]

YOU KNOW, YOUâ€™RE RIGHT.

I REALLY NEED TO GO TO BED.

SO, UM... LOOK, UM...

YEAH. SO... YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

GOOD NIGHT.

ARE YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

OH YEAH, I MEAN, Iâ€™VE JUST HAD A LONG DAY. SO...

WHERE'S MICHAEL AT?


EXCUSE ME. SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT.

COFFEE?

I FEEL SICK. ARE ANY OF THE GUYS UP?

NAH, THEYâ€™RE STILL ASLEEP.

I FEEL LIKE A TRAIN WRECK.

PROBABLY LOOK LIKE ONE.

WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS?

I DON'T KNOW. I STILL GOT TO TALK TO JULIAN.

SO, DID YOU GIVE HIM THE SUITCASE?

THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

COME HERE.

YOUâ€™RE CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT?

YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME.

TRUE.

SO, UH, HOW STRAIGHTâ€™S STEVEN?

PRETTY STRAIGHT TO ME.

SO, YOUR FIVE DAYS ARE UP.

I KNOW.

YOU COMPLETED ALL YOUR DUTIES.

IS THAT HOW YOU SEE ME?

AS A DUTY I NEEDED TO FULFILL?

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. Iâ€™M TIRED OF THINKING.

NOW THAT THE AUCTION IS OVER...

YOU DO THINK TOO MUCH.

LETâ€™S JUST ENJOY EACH OTHERâ€™S COMPANY.

AND I COULD SURE USE A GOOD MASSAGE.

WELL, HOW WAS HE?

COME ON, WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? ARE YOU JEALOUS?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?


WELL, HOW DOES HE?

HE DOESNâ€™T.

REALLY? WHY?

I MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH HIM, BUT...

I LOVE YOU.

I DONâ€™T APPROVE OF WHAT HEâ€™S DOING.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I DON'T KNOW. IT GETS COMPLICATED.

SIMPLIFY IT FOR ME.

MY PARENTS ALWAYS HAD HIM ON A PEDESTAL.

AFTER I FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM, THATâ€™S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE.

I WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

UNFORTUNATELY, THAT AFFECTED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM,

BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HER.

WAIT, YOU NEVER VISITED...

YOU NEVER VISITED YOUR MOTHER BECAUSE OF YOUR BROTHER?

MICHAEL!

AFTER OUR DAD DIED, THATâ€™S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE.

BABY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

I FUCKED THINGS UP!

NO, NO, NO, YOU DIDNâ€™T. COME ON.

NO, ITâ€™S TOO LATE.

NO, ITâ€™S NOT TOO LATE. YOU STILL HAVE JULIAN.

HE'S STILL HERE.

LISTEN, YOU GUYS JUST NEED TO MAKE AMENDS, OKAY?

LET IT GO. ITâ€™S TIME.

I DON'T DESERVE YOU. HOLD ME.

WEâ€™RE HERE FOR EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

HOLD ME.

DON'T EVER LET ME GO.

I WON'T. I PROMISE.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TODAY.

DONâ€™T YOU THINK IT WILL BE KIND OF AWKWARD

AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH CHANEL?

NO, WHY? MICHAEL ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE DID.

BUT WHAT ABOUT HER?

WHAT ABOUT HER? SHE'S THE ONE THAT CAME ON TO YOU.

LET'S JUST SEE HOW THINGS GO, OKAY?

ALL RIGHT. WELL, Iâ€™M HUNGRY. YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

YOU GO AHEAD. I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

YOU KNOW WHAT? CHANEL HAS SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

GO AHEAD.


IT WAS WRONG FOR ME TO DO WHAT I DID.

YOUâ€™RE RIGHT.

HEY, SHE'S TRYING HERE, ALL RIGHT?

LOOK, ITâ€™S OKAY.

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME.

IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY, I APOLOGIZE.

HE'S STRAIGHT, ISN'T HE?

YEAH!

JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

I MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT SUITCASE.

GOOD IDEA.

SO, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR TODAY?

I DONâ€™T KNOW YET.

BUT I FIGURED, FINDING OUT WHAT MOM LET IN THE SUITCASE

IS A GOOD START.

SO, DO YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION TO THIS?

OH. MOM SAID TO LOOK BEHIND THE PHONE.

"666... " MM-HMM?

"568... 37-87."

THERE WE... [LATCH CLICKS]

OH, THERE IT IS!

WHAT DOES IT SAY?

ALL RIGHT. LETâ€™S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

"DEAR MICHAEL AND JULIAN,

"Iâ€™D LIKE TO SAY THAT I LOVE YOU BOTH VERY MUCH...

"AND THAT I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT.

"LIFE IS SO SHORT, WHAT CAN I SAY?

"Iâ€™VE BEEN BLESSED WITH BOTH OF YOU AND Iâ€™M HAPPY I WAS ABLE

"TO SEE YOU GROW UP INTO KIND, CARING ADULTS."

"WE DID HAVE MANY STRUGGLES, BUT WE ALSO HAD GOOD TIMES AND GOOD MEMORIES.

"NEVER FORGET THE GOOD TIMES, FOR THOSE WILL KEEP MY SPIRIT ALIVE AND WELL WITH YOU

"AT ALL TIMES.

"I WOULD LIKE MY ASHES SPREAD UNDER THE TREE

"WHERE YOUR FATHER ASKED FOR MY HAND IN MARRIAGE.

"ITâ€™S AT THE TOP OF A HILL OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.

"I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE VIEW FROM THERE.

"YOUR FATHER AND I NAMED THE TREE TABOGA,

"AFTER WE RETURNED HOME FROM OUR ENGAGEMENT TRIP FROM TABOGA ISLAND IN PANAMA.

"IN THE SUITCASE, YOUâ€™LL FIND DIRECTIONS.

"I WANT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TO DELIVER MY REMAINS ALONE.

"Iâ€™VE INCLUDED A PRAYER IN THE ENVELOPE

"SECLUDED IN WHICH YOU SHOULD ONLY OPEN

"PRIOR TO SPREADING MY ASHES.

"BY THE TIME YOUâ€™RE READING THIS LETTER,

"I WOULD HAVE PASSED ON.

"I WOULD HAVE ASKED MY LIFELONG FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR WINNIE

"TO ARRANGE MY FINAL WISHES WITH FATHER JOSIAH.

"YOU MAY PICK UP MY REMAINS FROM HIM AT THE CHURCH.

[MOTHERâ€™S VOICE] "I WONâ€™T SAY GOODBYE BECAUSE DEATH IS ONLY A DETOUR

"ALONG LIFEâ€™S WINDING WAY.

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. MOM."

â™ªâ™ª [CHURCH ORGAN]

LETâ€™S HOLD HANDS...

AND SAY A PRAYER FOR YOUR MOTHER.

OH, HEAVENLY FATHER,

WE GIVE YOU THANKS FOR SENDING US KATHRYN ANGELA ROBINSON.

WE KNOW, FATHER, THAT YOU DECIDE...

WHEN WE STAY AND WHEN WE GO.

WE THANK YOU FOR THE TIMES WE HAD WITH HER,

AND FOR ALL SHE DID IN YOUR NAME WHILE SHE WAS VISITING US...

AND WEâ€™RE CONFIDENT IN KNOWING THAT NOW THAT SHE IS WITH YOU,

HER SONS, JULIAN AND MICHAEL,

WILL FIND SOLACE AND COMFORT.

MAY HER SOUL REST IN PEACE AND HARMONY,

IN KNOWING THAT YOU, WHO HAVE CREATED US,

HAVE A PLAN MUCH BIGGER FOR ALL OF US.

WE ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR ALL OF OUR SINS,

FOR WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A FORGIVING FATHER.

AND MAY HER SONS FIND THE PATH TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,

AS THEY ENGAGE IN THEIR JOURNEY

TO DELIVER THEIR MOTHER TO YOU, OH LORD.

IN YOUR NAME, WE ASK OF THEE, AMEN.

MAY THE LORD KEEP YOU

AND KEEP YOUR SAFE YOU IN YOUR JOURNEY.

THANK YOU, FATHER.

WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

OH, LEAVING EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.

YOUR MOTHER WAS AN ADMIRABLE WOMAN.

OUR DOORS WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO YOU.

ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A TOMORROW

WHERE THE SUN WILL SHINE UPON YOU.

GOOD LUCK.

HEY. HI.

HOW DID IT GO?

GOOD. JUST GETTING READY.

HOW ABOUT YOU? HOW ARE YOU DOING?

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

Iâ€™D LIKE TO STICK AROUND,

BUT YOUR MOTHER WANTED ONLY YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TO TAKE THIS TRIP.

I CAN RESPECT THAT.

WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO BE HERE WHEN I GET BACK?

I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

I UNDERSTAND.

I CANâ€™T BE EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE TO YOU.

AT LEAST NOT THE WAY YOU EXCEPT ME TO.

Iâ€™M NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING FROM YOU, STEVEN.

YOU CHOSE TO COME HERE. I KNOW.

DO YOU REGRET MEETING ME?

HOW CAN YOU ASK ME SOMETHING LIKE THAT? OF COURSE NOT.

I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE HERE. WITH YOU.

THEN WHY THE DOUBT?

I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE WHO SEEMS SO CONFIDENT,

YOU DONâ€™T SEEM SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.

I MEAN, I MAY NOT HAVE MUCH, AS YOU CAN SEE,

BUT I DO KNOW WHO I AM AND WHO I WANT.

JULIAN, WE PRACTICALLY JUST MET.

I CARE ABOUT YOU AS A FRIEND

AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

ITâ€™S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU, AND I WANT TO BE HERE.

SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE STAYING?

AT LEAST UNTIL YOU LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING.

YOU KNOW, I NEVER ASKED, BUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO?

I WAS A TRUST FUND KID. I INVESTED MY MONEY WELL IN THE STOCK MARKET,

AND I OWN MY OWN REAL ESTATE COMPANY.

WELL, IT SOUNDS SUCCESSFUL.

ITâ€™S NOT MUCH IF YOU DONâ€™T HAVE SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH.

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE?

Iâ€™M NOT SURE.

EVERY TIME I THINK THINGS ARE GOING GREAT,

SOMETHING HAPPENS, AND Iâ€™M RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED FROM.

I MEAN, I CAN NEVER SEEM TO GET MY LIFE TOGETHER.

Iâ€™D LIKE TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS SOMEDAY TOO,

BUT I NEVER SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

I MEAN, I DONâ€™T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH MONEY RIGHT NOW TO SURVIVE.

WHAT ABOUT THIS HOUSE?

Iâ€™D LIKE TO KEEP THIS HOUSE. I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE ALL MY MEMORIES ARE.

BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN AFFORD IT.

AND MICHAEL?

WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL?

I DON'T KNOW. CAN'T HE HELP OUT?

I DONâ€™T TRUST MICHAEL.

THE ONLY TIME WE EVER SAW HIM WAS WHEN HE WANTED TO BORROW OR STEAL MONEY FROM US.

I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU OUT.

THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

BESIDES, I DONâ€™T WANT ANY HANDOUTS.

EVERYTHING I HAVE, I'VE EARNED.

WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOUâ€™D BE INTERESTED IN HELPING ME WITH MY BUSINESS.

WOULD THAT WORK FOR YOU?

I MEAN, BECAUSE IT WONâ€™T WORK FOR ME.

IN CASE YOU HAVENâ€™T NOTICED, I LIKE YOU.

I MEAN, WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH MY FEELINGS?

I DONâ€™T KNOW. I LIKE YOU A LOT.

IT SAYS WE NEED TO GO THROUGH HERE.

DUDE, WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

I HOPE YOUâ€™RE UP FOR A HIKE.

LETâ€™S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.

JULIAN! I GOT TO TAKE A BREAK.

REST HERE.

DUDE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

FOLLOWING THESE DIRECTIONS.


WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

DUDE. I'M FUCKING RELAXING.

RELAXING! WHAT THE FUCK...

I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?

I JUST DO IT ON OCCASION. JEEZ.

MICHAEL, I AM SO SICK OF YOUR BULLSHIT!

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU PUT MOM AND I THROUGH

BECAUSE OF IT? DO YOU?

HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT FOR YOURSELF!

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU LITTLE BITCH?

FUCK YOU, DUDE! JESUS CHRIST, MAN!


I FUCKING HATE YOU! COCKSUCKER!

FUCK THIS! FUCK YOU, MICHAEL!

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU FUCKED UP.

DONâ€™T YOU EVEN SEE WHY MOM SENT US BOTH OUT HERE?

DONâ€™T YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? ARE YOU THAT FUCKING BLIND?

I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS! NEITHER DID I! GROW THE FUCK UP.

WHAT'S THE FUCKINâ€™ USE. DONâ€™T BE A PRICK, DUDE.

WHAT THE HELL, MAN. FUCKING DRUGGIE.

FUCK YOU, DUDE. Iâ€™M DOING THIS ON MY OWN.

YOU FUCKING GAY FAG! FUCK YOU!

JULIAN, WAIT!

DUDE, JULIAN... DUDE, WAIT UP.

STOP BEING... DUDE, DONâ€™T BE A FUCKINâ€™ BITCH, DUDE!

YOU ALWAYS DO THIS SHIT, BRO. COME ON!

JULIAN, COME ON! JESUS. LOOK, Iâ€™M SORRY!


WHAT ABOUT YOU? DONâ€™T YOU THINK YOU MADE MOM SICK

KNOWING SHE HAD A FUCKING FAGGOT OF A SON?

AT LEAST I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT MY CONDITION.

HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MADE HER FEEL?

SHE LOVED ME. REGARDLESS, SHE LOVED ME!

AND I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE I WAS WITH HER.

I DIDN'T GIVE UP ON MYSELF LIKE YOU DID.

SO NOW YOUâ€™RE BETTER THAN ME?

WHY DID YOU COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? HUH, MICHAEL?

WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE?

HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED THIS TIME?

BOY, YOU MUST BE IN A HELL OF A LOT OF FUCKINâ€™ TROUBLE

TO HAVE BROUGHT YOUR TWEAKER OF A GIRLFRIEND HERE

WITH YOU TO HELP BURY YOUR OWN MOTHER!

IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

BECAUSE THATâ€™S ALL YOU EVER FUCKINâ€™ WANTED FROM US.

TAKE IT, MICHAEL! TAKE IT ALL!

AND SHOVE UP YOUR FUCKINâ€™ NOSE, LIKE YOUâ€™VE DONE WITH THE REST OF OUR GODDAMN MONEY!

WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

Iâ€™M THE GUY WHO WORKED EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK

TO HELP KEEP A ROOF OVER YOUR MOTHERâ€™S HEAD.

WHO PAID THE FUCKINâ€™ BILLS.

WHO VISITED HER BECAUSE SHE HADNâ€™T GOT A CALL FROM HER SON, MICHAEL,

IN SEVERAL MONTHS, AND SHE DIDNâ€™T KNOW

IF HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE?

HOW COULD I BE AROUND HER WHEN SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH YOU?

JULIAN THIS, AND JULIAN THAT. EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

AND I WASNâ€™T GOING TO SIT AROUND TO SEE YOU LIVE OUT YOUR FILTHY FUCKINâ€™ LIFESTYLE.

YOU MAKE ME SICK!

NICE TO KNOW HOW YOU REALLY FEEL, MICHAEL.

FUCKING PATHETIC!

FUCK!

JULIAN, WAIT!


[SOBBING, SCREAMING]
