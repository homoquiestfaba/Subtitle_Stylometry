Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.

Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

Please.

My sister, she's very, very sick.

I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

Do you know my mother?
No.

She's very, very sick.

I'll give you two.

That's a bad idea, you know.

Like feeding pigeons.

Do I know you?
My name is Semelier.

I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

I cabled you last week.
Yes.

And I didn't answer.

There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

No, it's not possible.

The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

but they never got that far south.

Nevertheless, there it sits.

The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

We believe a rare object waits inside.

We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

So you think I'm a thief?

Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

in everything except himself.

Ah.
You know nothing about me.

You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

an expert in religious icons.

You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

a representation
of a mythical demon.

It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

He's been persuaded to let you join it.

You're assuming that I will say yes.

You already have.

March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

Left. Left, right, left.

Left. Left. Left, right, left.

Left.

Left, right, left.

Left. Left. Left, right, left.

Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

Beautiful, aren't they?

It's a hobby from school days.

Works wonders for the nerves.

You should try it sometime.

What can you tell me about the dig?

The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

called Derati.

It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

on maneuvers there.

When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

What have they learned so far?

That it's a church
where no church should be.

This is Father Francis.

He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

I've read all your work at seminary.
It's Mr. Merrin.

I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

when Rome learned of the discovery.

They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

Hmm.

How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

We haven't...

officially.

You're both my guests.

Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

Well, not until I've seen it.

Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

I'm afraid not.

We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
Since the beginning.

The British hired me as an interpreter.

What happened here?

Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

How many died?
All of them.

I'm Lancaster Merrin.

Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

He did.

Is something bothering you, mate?

No.

I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
You drink, Merrin?

I shouldn't...

but my will is weak.

Then you might just survive this place.

I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

but that progress has slowed down.

You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
Lancaster... Lancaster Merrin.

You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

How about a muzzle?

So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

They're not.
No?

Has the structure collapsed?

No, the church is perfect...

but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

Why's that?

I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

Well... pleasant fellow.

What's wrong with his face?

Other than that it's
attached to his body?

Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind of localized infection.

Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

Evil spirits.
Oh.

If you believe the Turkana.
And do you?

No. I'm a doctor.

But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

Now, that's funny.

I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

Father Merrin.

This is Emekwi.

He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

Hello, James, Joseph.
They are learning the Bible.

We are, uh, Christians.
Hmm.

Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
Oh, of course.

James. Joseph.

Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

There's your goddamn church.

Is this your first assignment, Father?

Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

The Vatican.
Impressive.

But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

This is strange.

It's 1,500 years old.

It should be badly weathered.

It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

Chuma.

Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

Hyenas?

They've been here
ever since we started digging.

Even at daytime?

No! No! No!

What's the matter with him?
I don't know.

The heat?

Joseph?

Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

I'm collecting rocks.
I can see that.

I think you're about
ready for this now.

It's a tool for professional diggers.

Wow.

His seizure's stopped.

I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

Well, that must make
your job very hard.

You have no idea.

Thank you.

So what is it you hope to find here?

The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

You were a priest once, weren't you?
Yes, I was.

Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

I have to get back to town.
Wait.

I, uh... I found this...

and, uh, I want you to have it.

It's a St. Joseph, for luck.

Please, for my behavior.

Thank you.
Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
Don't!

Joseph, wait.
Don't do that.

All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

It's okay. Come.

These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

A few days.

And in the meantime, how do we get in?
We don't.

Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

Following us, Father?

Is it safe to walk around?

Let's see.

Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

Cast out after the war in heaven.

Can't even trust angels, can you?

You ever seen anything like it?
Not this far from Rome.

It's odd.

Churches were built to exalt heaven...

but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

Look behind you, Father.

Desecration of Christ.

Who would do something like this?

The crucifix
was broken off from here.

Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

I wouldn't know.

Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

It's not possible.
Why not?

He's gone mad.

No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

They are superstitious.

And you?
Not superstitious. Smart.

Chuma.
Yes?

Where's Bession now?
A sanitorium in Nairobi.

How long has he been gone?
A few weeks.

And he can read and write Aramaic?
Sorry?

The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

And what does it say?

The fallen shall rise...

in a river of blood."

Do you have a moment?

Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

Or maybe something
more substantial?

Yes, that would be very nice.

You dabble in the occult?

I found them here when I arrived.

I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

He had no medical symptoms...

nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

That and the disappearances.

In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

Runaways?

Or is it those evil spirits?

Yeah.

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

My father was a strong man.

When the Nazis started
rounding up the Jews in our town...

he didn't hesitate.

He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

But someone turned us in...

and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

I'm sorry.

People can't really
understand, can they?

If they weren't there...

if they didn't see.

No.

And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

One night I realized
I... I had to tell him the truth...

about... the Nazis...

and what they did to me.

After that, he never touched me again.

So...

what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

I don't know.
I suppose I...

I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

No.

There's no point in that.

Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

I should get to bed.

I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

Talk to Father Gionetti.
Gionetti?

He runs the sanitarium.

Well, thank you...

for the medical care.

Deliver us from evil...

for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

Amen.

You, priest.
What is your name?

I'm Father Merrin.

God is not here today, priest.

Want some water?

Hey, what's wrong?

It's late.

You should go back to bed.

Give it to me! It's mine!

Oh, is it yours?
Give it to me!

Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
Here, take it.

Take it!
Oh, just give it to me, you idiot!

Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

Give it to me!
It's mine.

Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
Just give it to me!

All right. Okay, okay.

Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

Joseph, look out!

Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

Joseph, help me!

Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

No! Help me!

Help! Help me!

Help me!

Help me!
Help me! Please!

What happened?
Hyenas. They tore James apart.

Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

They were focused on his brother.

That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

Can you see?
Can you hear?

Come with me.

Monsieur Bession?

Mr. Bession.

You worked on a dig in Derati.

You drew a picture of an idol.

Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

Mr. Bession.

Father Merrin.
How do you know my name?

I said how do you know my name?

Are you hurt?

No.

I'm free.

God is not here today, priest.

I hope he finds peace.

I'm Father Gionetti.

I've been waiting for you.

How did he know my name?

Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

So, "touched."
What does that mean?

In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

was plagued by possession.

Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

committing unspeakable acts.

Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

Simply horny... and inventive.

Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

with evil.

That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

And that evil remains in Derati.

You must be careful there.

Remember, he is the father of lies.

He will seek to poison your mind.

You will need this against him.

The Roman Rituals.

If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

I'm not a priest anymore.

You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

Only your faith can save you.

Well, then I'm doomed.

Joseph?

What do you have there?

Can I see?

You threw it away.

Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
It was in the dirt outside.

You threw it away.
No, I didn't.

The clasp must have come loose...
Liar!

Do I repulse you that much?

Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

Joseph?
He's coming for you.

What?

He's coming for you.

What happened?
I had a bad dream.

Ohh.

Don't worry.

You'll be fine.

Where is everybody?

Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

Oh.

Joseph. Hey.

Joseph.

You're back.

Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

These lesions...
they're not from the shock, are they?

No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

It just doesn't make sense.

He should have recovered by now.
So what is it?

In this part of the world...

it could be a dozen things...

but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

I have to do some work up at the dig.

Will you be all right?
Hmm. Yes.

Come sit with me, Lancaster.

I promise I won't bite.

What is it?

How was Nairobi?
Oh, fine.

Did you see Monsieur Bession?
He's dead.

How?
I don't know.

Some accident.

I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

Hey.

Easy.

Help me hold him.

Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.
