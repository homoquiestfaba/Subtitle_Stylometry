<i>[ghostly drone]</i>

<i>[swoosh]</i>

<i>(Children)
Happy birthday, Jacob!</i>

[children's laughter]

the twins are 10.

[children laugh
and yell playfully]

Rock, paper, scissors.

Jacob stays.

<i>[ominous drone]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
One, two.</i>

<i>(girl) Wait up, Daniel, we
want to hide with you.</i>

<i>(girl)
Slow down.</i>

<i>[disturbing drone]</i>

[Mother chats and chuckles]

<i>[disturbing drone]</i>

<i>[sudden beat]</i>

<i>(Mother) It's cake time! Let's get
the young ones in here.</i>

[children yell]

<i>[eery drone
and children yelling]</i>

Jacob! Jacob!

<i>[eery drone
and children yelling]</i>

[screams in horror]

Daniel. Daniel,
my baby!

<i>(Mother) [crying] My baby.
[slashing sound]</i>

<i>(Mother)
Jacob, call an ambulance.</i>

<i>(Mother) [ongoing scream
and slashing sound] Jacob!</i>

<i>[sudden beat and
soft piano music]</i>

<i>(female voice)

[sirens and screech
of brakes]

<i>(Jacob, husky voice with a Southern drawl)
Where's the bomb squad?</i>

<i>(male voice)
It's coming!</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Clear these people out of here!</i>

<i>(Jacob) Let's move. We've got
less than 5 minutes.</i>

Help me.

<i>God, it hurts.</i>

My name is Jacob. It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna fix this.

<i>I'm gonna talk
to you, alright?</i>

I promise you, we're gonna solve
this right away. You hear me?

<i>Somebody get me a fucking
blanket up in here!</i>

<i>(Storm) Looks like Billy Joe for sure.
She's got a C4 sewn up on her chest.</i>

It's not like him to leave
her out in the open like this.

No, he's flipping
the MO, man.

<i>He's trying
to fuck with our heads.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
That's him.</i>

<i>(Storm)
Yeah.</i>

<i>(Jacob) And you know,
he's up there watching us right now.</i>

<i>[siren and drone]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
How's the view?</i>

What the fuck are
you doing in my place?

Mm-hm. The door was open and by
the looks of the decor around here,

it don't look
like it's your place.

Yeah, well granny
just checked out.

The difference between you and me is,
you love to prey the weak and innocent,

but I like to prey on
sick people like you

<i>[grunts, crashing and
hard rock guitar notes]</i>

Listen to me.

<i>(Jacob)
Which color wire do I cut?</i>

The one that says
"fuck you" on it.

<i>Which wire, Billy?</i>

<i>Get up!</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Come on.</i>

<i>Ready to talk? Huh?</i>

<i>Which wire, Billy?
Which wire?</i>


<i>Get up.</i>

You ready to
talk to me?

Come on,
white trash.

Ah! [sound
of bones breaking]

Okay. Okay.

Alright. Our suspect
is ready to cooperate.

<i>I got it narrowed.
Yellow or black?</i>

<i>(Billy)
Try pink, ass.</i>

<i>[suspense music intensifies]</i>

Yo Billy, we cut the
yellow or the black?

[spits and coughs]

<i>Yellow or black?</i>

Out the black one.

Out the yellow wire.

<i>[music intensifies]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Cut the fucking yellow!</i>

[clip and music stops]

Ah.

<i>(Male voice over radio)
We're clear.</i>

All right, bitch.
You're under arrest.

Get up against the
wall and give me a hand.

fuck you!


Ah!

<i>[guitar riff]</i>

<i>Hey, looks like he got the hiccups.
Somebody get that guy a glass of water.</i>

Hey. You gettin' any closer
to cracking the Grifter's code?

Wilson? I don't know
about that, man.

<i>This guy's smart,
but I'll get 'em.</i>

You hear of the ODLU got that
scumbag Billy Joe Hill on appeal?

Why does that
not surprise me?

He's not gonna
walk though now, is he?

If he does, he will kill again
right quick. And that's the truth.

I know.

<i>[slow jazz music]</i>

What are you doing here?

<i>I missed you.</i>

<i>You must've been
here a long time.</i>

I was in your
office earlier.

It's kind of creepy.
What's with all these charts [audio]?

<i>I bet it's the Grifter case.</i>

You got that
right, darling, see,

in Homicide we sometimes
have creepy guys,

we gotta work with and this
particular guy is kinda creepy.

He's killed four
people in five months.

<i>[sexy jazz music continues]</i>

You work too hard.

Well, you drink too much.

<i>I have to work.</i>

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>[flashback of children's voices]
Happy birthday, Jacob.</i>

<i>[screeching sound and drone]</i>

<i>[children's voices and drone]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
One! Two!</i>

[child sobs]

<i>[drone and
children's laughter]</i>

<i>[screeching sound
and distorted guitar notes]</i>

<i>(OS Daniel)
Come on. Here I come.</i>

<i>(Daniel)
Let go!</i>

[hip hop car music]

Hi, baby.

Looking for anything?


Oh!

<i>[baby crying]</i>

<i>[baby crying]</i>

Do you need help?

Could you?

Appreciate that.
Very Christian of you.

I never figured
these damn things out.

No problem. Been
through this drill before.

[baby cries]

Ah!

<i>[drone]</i>


<i>(Lazarus) A moon is cloaked in blood.
Amends must be made.</i>

A time of great degeneration.

No one has ears to hear.

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>No one speaks
the ultimate truth.</i>

But I have heard the truth.

I've seen the peaks.

I've seen the valleys.

I've seen the land
all around this world.

And I've seen the light.

<i>[drone]</i>

I've seen it.

You shut your mouth!

<i>Shut your dirty mouth.</i>

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>(Coroner)
Looks like the Grifter's at it again.</i>

<i>Night shift
picked her up.</i>

murdered. She was punished!

<i>(Jacob)
You find the cipher?</i>

<i>Yeah. Over here.</i>

<i>What else you got, Is?</i>

<i>Result of death, massive
blunt force trauma.</i>

In other words, she
was beat to death.

<i>There's oneinteresting thing
about these cases.</i>

He likes to take
his time with some,

<i>others like this poor girl,
he makes it real quick.</i>

<i>You know what I was
starting to think, Is?</i>

It almost seems like he
manipulates the time of death.

Like he's watching
the clock or something.

Do me a favor.
Pull up a time of death for each victim.

<i>Junky, for sure.</i>

Yeah, ain't they all?

No. Not all.

[door opens]

Just talked to the uniform who
canvassed the area where she was found.

He name's Jessica.

<i>Worked the curb some but mostly
did alcohol from Mojo Blues.</i>

Mm-hm.

[cell phone rings]

<i>Hello? Yes. sir.</i>

What else, brother?

Hard to tell if
there was a rape.

<i>She was a hooker by trade.
She's got a Cesarean scar.</i>

<i>She must've had
at least one child.</i>

<i>She was headed down a way path,
no matter how you look at it.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Yeah.</i>

Hand me some cotton swab,
brother. With some alcohol.

<i>Look at that.</i>

<i>This is the astrological
symbol for the full moon.</i>

<i>Our man is really trying to tell us
something, ain't he now? [door opens]</i>

That's the Captain.

He's wants to sit down. He's starting
to get a lot of heat from the press.

<i>(Jacob)
Yeah. I'm sure he is.</i>

[guitar riff]

He's mostly
playing good.


You look familiar.
Cop, right?

Let me ask you something.

Do you know a girl
called Jessica Trimble?

I've seen her. She worked
this place for John's.

I never talked to her
except to take drink orders.

If you never talked to her,
how do you know her name?

I watch the news. I've
seen you a bunch of times.

You're some
hot shot, huh?

Yeah, baby. A hot shot.

Look, I need some help.

<i>Them two, the
taller one's Leon.</i>

He pimped her.

Okay.

Listen, this Leon,

did you ever have
sex with him?

<i>And I'm not asking for
the reasons you might think.</i>

Yeah. He ain't that smart but
he's all right in that department.

Hey, baby,
what's happening?

Got people
waiting out front?

I ain't need no
people out front.

<i>I think you do.</i>

Lord have mercy.

Here's how it is with the police.
We come here, we ask questions,

we canvas areas, we politely
do our job, you know.

<i>Now, I got some questions
about Jessica Trimble.</i>

Either I'm gonna arrest
you and take you downtown,

or you're gonna talk to me now.

<i>Looks like you
wanna talk to my fist.</i>


Get up. Get up!

<i>Batter up.</i>

<i>Now it's my turn.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Girls don't play.</i>

<i>Don't wanna play?</i>

<i>Gimme your best shot.</i>

<i>(Barmaid)
Leon, stay down.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
My man, Leon.</i>

<i>You ready to answer
my questions, Leon?</i>

fuck you!

Come with me. I need
to take your statement.


You're one
tough cop, honey.


<i>Hey, Leon.</i>

Get that mother fucker!

Ah!

Ah!

<i>(Barmaid)
Look out!</i>

<i>[Police sirens]</i>

Shit.

fuck!

Oh!

<i>[Police sirens sound closer]</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>[louder Police sirens
and brakes screech]</i>

<i>(Officer)
Detective King.</i>

Two suspects ran down
that alley. One's wounded.

All right.
Let's go get 'em.

<i>(Jacob) Call the medic.
Another man down here.</i>

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>(Captain Jensen)
Detective Anderson,</i>

this is Frankie Miller.

<i>She's FBI.</i>

I've been assigned to
look into the Grifter case.

<i>Grifter?</i>

Damn the press
and their nicknames.

Jacob know about this?

<i>You listen to me. I'm giving this
woman permission to go wherever</i>

<i>or speak to
whoever she needs.</i>

King's got a hell of a track record. We're
just interested in seeing how he does it.

You keep this transition
smooth, or it's gonna get ugly.

Ugly?

Okay. Give us
your damn briefing.

At this point, we don't know
why he chooses his victims.

<i>what we do have is a
series of gruesome murders</i>

<i>committed with brute force.</i>

The body count as
of today is five.

What's this guy's marker?

He carves an astrological
symbol on the body.

<i>On several occasions, he's left a
letter near the body or on the body.</i>

<i>Symbols, cyphers.
That type of shit.</i>

Jacob has it
partially decoded.

But not completely.

<i>Where the hell
is Jacob anyhow?</i>

<i>He had every intention of being
here but something came up.</i>

Kinda makes us look
like assholes, don't it?

[rhythmic hip hop music]

<i>Hey.</i>

Where's Ryanne?

The brunette in red.
Boyfriend just got back.

She's so loaded on X,
she didn't even notice.

Set it up.

Your boyfriend's down
that alley over there.

Okay. Thanks.

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>Hey, Ryanne.</i>

<i>Where's your boyfriend?</i>

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>[screams]</i>

<i>(children sing) [swooshing sound]
Happy birthday, Daniel. Happy birthday, Jacob.</i>

<i>[eery drone]</i>

<i>[children's voices]
Walt, Daniel. We want to hide with you.</i>

<i>[sudden beat and drone]</i>

<i>[eery screeching
and metallic slashing sounds]</i>

<i>(male voice)
You're mine.</i>

<i>[drone intensifies]</i>

<i>[knocking on door]</i>

Hey. Sorry
about the hour.

<i>Man, I'm a night owl.
You want a drink?</i>

Trying to quit, but one
drink will be alright.



What's on
your mind, baby?

A lot of heat
coming down.

<i>The Captain's pissed. The FBI
assigned's been assigned to the case.</i>

That don't mean shit.

We walk a fine line.

But Jacob,
I need this pinch.

Baby, you have
nothing to worry about.

<i>There ain't nobody
gonna get your pinch.</i>

Thanks, Jacob.

I'm probably real
paranoid right about now.

<i>(Storm) So you'll give me a call
if you hear anything else, alright?</i>

What's goin' on?

<i>(Storm)
Another Grifter victim.</i>

Mm-hm.
What about it?

Up down there. follow me.
Celine was first on scene.

Is that right?

<i>(Storm) Why is the crime
scene always on the top floor?</i>

Good morning, Sunshine.

<i>(Celine)
Morning, Detectives.</i>

How are you doin'?

<i>(Celine)
Better than that guy there.</i>

<i>Detective King.
Frankie Miller, FBI.</i>

Oh Lord have mercy.

<i>Yeah folks downtown
told me you'd be coming,</i>

<i>and they kinda want
me to cooperate.</i>

Well, I'm not here
to get in the way,

<i>mostly observe, possibly offer
some of my own expertise.</i>

I'd love some of your
expertise, 'cause at your age,

<i>you probably got a lot
more expertise than we do.</i>

<i>(Storm)
Lots more.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
You know what I mean?</i>

What's happenin' Crystal?

<i>(Crystal)
How are you, Mr. King?</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Fine. You keeping busy?</i>

<i>(Crystal) I'm alright.
Take care of yourself right now.</i>

I guess this wasn't
the place he was killed.

No, sir, you look
at them drag marks.

Definitely not.

Can you just back up just a
little bit? Gimme a second.

It's your world.

The lacerations
around the neck there.

<i>Looks like he was choked with
a rope. The Lord have mercy.</i>

<i>See the carving on the hand?
That's a [audio].</i>

<i>It's a warning
to back off.</i>

<i>Two murders in two days.
Our man's on the move.</i>

<i>Take a look
at that mirror.</i>

You know, there was a mirror at
the Jessica Trimble crime scene.

<i>Exactly. Now
check this out.</i>

As you can see,

<i>the body drag marks of his heels are on
top of the drag marks from the mirror.</i>

It's like a play for him.

Nice.

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>(Storm) There was a mirror at the
Mosher crime scene.</i>

He do like this
every time.

I handled a homicide once.

She handled a homicide once.
One time!

<i>See if you can get that photographer
to come back here to bag his shoes.</i>

I wanna take photographs of these
drag marks and the carving on his body.

<i>(Frankie)
Will do.</i>

Stick around.
This girl can entertain you.

Wouldn't you say, Storm?
She's very entertaining.

Are you staying?

I hate the smell when
they popped it a little.

<i>(Storm) You girls have a blast.
If it gets too strong in here, crack a window.</i>

Agent Miller. Do you want a copy
of this report sent to your office?

Thanks. That will
be appreciated.

<i>I once had this case in a dumps
site, it was a complete nightmare,</i>

there was trash everywhere
we just had to...


<i>[barfs]</i>

Sweet.

<i>(Celine)
Are you sure you're alright?</i>

I'll be fine.

[muffled shouting and banging]

I thought this
place was abandoned.

The lower floor
still has some tenants.

Drug fiends. We
already interviewed them.

Where are you going?

To make sure
everything's fine.

Agent Miller, we shouldn't
get involved in domestic shit.

Half the time the women
don't even press charges.

You did or you didn't? If you don't
tell me, I'm gonna cut you open.

Please, you've just smoked
too much crack. Relax!

[loud crash]

<i>Step away from her
and put the knife down.</i>

Who the fuck are you?

<i>Federal Agent.
Put the knife down!</i>

Put the knife down!

He's high. Please
don't shoot him.

You gonna
shoot me, cop?

No one's shooting. Just put the knife
down. We'll talk about this. Okay?

She's been
fucking around.

<i>I'm not good
enough for her.</i>

That's not true.

You're lying! Do you
think I don't see things?

They know what's going
on behind my back!

They're lying.

Hey! Put the knife down,
or I'll put you down.

So shoot me.
See if I give a fuck.

If you didn't have
that badge and that gun

you wouldn't be looking me
in the fuckin' eye, bitch.

Are you okay?

You didn't
have to hurt him.

<i>[moans]</i>

Are you okay, baby?

I'm so sorry.

I told you so.

The bartender said the victim
was a venue promoter, Lance Myers.

liked to pay cash, liked to
change locations every few weeks.

<i>He said, "I never saw a
more dedicated business man, "</i>

"always showed the
kids a good time,"

<i>"He's the best
boss I ever had"</i>

Showed the kids a good time?
Sh! That's rich.

This fucker's a
registered sex offender.

He pays his
employees in cash.

I need statements from everyone
up in there right quick, you hear?

Hey, have you figured
out the code yet?

Man, I'm real close
on this cypher baby.

Real close.

<i>(Frankie)
I need to interview about Billy Joe Hill.</i>

Detective Anderson,
you're first.

The Captain says your
cooperation is expected.

You ain't got anything
to worry about.

How's your tummy, sweetheart.
I heard you lost your lunch.

<i>[expectant music]</i>

I was hoping we could talk
in a place a little more...

A little more
romantic, perhaps?

A little less sterile.

That little incident
at the crime scene,

you're not used to
field work, are you?

I've done my share of field
work, mostly profile stuff.

And you're asking
us the questions?

We're talking about the psychology
of murder, not just the investigation,

it's not for you to decide
whether I'm qualified.

Oh. Please.

What was your involvement
in the Billy Joe Hill arrest?

Were you there when
King made the arrest?

This guy's a real
piece of work.

He was dishonorably
discharged after Desert Storm.

He's trained as a medic but also as
a small arms and explosives expert.

You can't be thinking
this guy's gonna walk.

He already has.

<i>It wasn't our call.</i>

Witness refuse to testify
and the Court overturned it.

<i>They found the excessive force used
by Detective King unconstitutional</i>

and the DNA evidence
to be suspect.

That animal should
be put to death.

Right.

<i>[expectant music]</i>

<i>(Attorney)
Here you go, Mr. Hill.</i>

Hey, this was a
sweet kick in the ass.


Shit.

I got my
knife back.

Why not? You're a
citizen again, Mr. Hill.

<i>Call me Billy Joe.</i>

Where's Detective King?

<i>Headed out. Said
he'd be at the morgue.</i>

<i>(Frankie)
Is he avoiding me?</i>

Ha! You wish.

Listen, sport.
You'd better slow down.

I don't know what they
taught you up there in DO,

but you'd better make damn sure
you know what the hell you're doing.

<i>[distorted, screeching notes]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Ice man!</i>

<i>(Jacob) What's going on, baby?
You alright?</i>

I'm starting to see
you more than a wife.

<i>Is this my guy?</i>

Man, what a shame.

Pretty, pretty young girl
like this, end up like that.

<i>It ain't right.
Where's my guy?</i>

I didn't take a look around.
I'm up to my ass in dead bodies.

<i>And he's at the
back of the line.</i>

Oh he's at the
back of the line?

And I thought I'm not gonna
have some preference, you know?

<i>Do you know why
I became a pathologist?</i>

A coroner, man. don't get
carried away with the title.

<i>(Frankie)
Clever.</i>

<i>Lord have mercy. You're like a bad
rash, man, you ust keep coming back.</i>

Yeah. Look, can I
talk to you for a bit.

Sure enough.

I'm going to the
coffee machine.

What are you scared of?

<i>I ain't scared of nothing.</i>

The quicker I
get through this...

The quicker I get
you out of my life.

No. The quicker we can
investigate the case at hand.

Well, tell me
what you need.

I was hoping we could talk
in a place a little more...

A little more charming?
This is police work.

Come on up here,
meet my girl.

[clears throat]

Fine.

Look, I'm just gonna
get straight to the point.

There's several questions in regards to
the evidence gathered in the Hill case.

That should all be
detailed in my report.

Well, I'm sure it is, but we
still need to talk about it.

Uh, well, you tell me specifically,
exactly what you want to know about,

<i>and I'll give it all
to you. [phone rings]</i>

Yeah.

You're joking.

Lord have mercy. The fu...
I'll get back to you.

<i>So you're boy, Billy Joe,</i>

just got out,

<i>and in only one hour he
killed three more people.</i>

How you like that?

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
I got it, baby.</i>

You decoded
the latest sign?

I broke the code.

<i>"The soul you kill
is the soul you keep. "</i>

<i>"At the edge of space,
this is the true religion. "</i>

<i>I can read the words.</i>

I just don't know
what he's saying.

<i>[expectant music]</i>

Hi. Excuse me.

<i>I got a kinda of a
long shot here for you.</i>

Um.

This individual
[clears throat]

<i>is a poet, I mean, at
least he thinks he is.</i>

Do you recognize
any of this?

Nothing I've
seen before. Sorry.

Uh huh.

Well, he does like
these astrology things,

and this kind of poetry concerning
the arcane and the occult

<i>and, I mean, you know where I can
find something like that here?</i>

That's not my job.
Check the directory.

Uh huh. I guess being
polite ain't your job either.

[phone rings]

<i>[eery music]</i>

<i>[female voice on loudspeaker]
Closing time is in five minutes.</i>

We're closing. Any luck?

Hell, yeah, man.
I got all kinds of luck.

Well, like I said,
we're closing.

Hell, I'm just,

getting ready to put
all this shit away now.

Never mind. I can do
it quicker than you can.

Hey, you're so nice
all of a sudden, huh?

Southern Death Threat.

What's that?

The line you wrote down.
It's from their song.

<i>That's what you're
looking for, right?</i>

And where do you
think I can find them?

A shit hole club on Western,
All About Eve,

<i>They play the same
crappy songs every night.</i>

A bunch of them
are astrology nuts.

Man, you've
been a big help.

Have a good night.

You sure I can't put
this shit away for you?

<i>[eery music continues]</i>

Hello. [chuckles]

[heavy rock music]

Fuck you, man.

Fuck you!

What do you think
you're doing?

[indistinct shouting]

<i>That'll be
$5. 50. Thanks.</i>

What do you
need, honey?

I'm looking
for somebody.

Aren't we all?

Yes, ma'am
I suppose we are.

<i>What's the name
of the band?</i>

Southern Death Threat.
You like them?

Are you an agent?

Maybe.

Their demo's coming out.
I wrote some of the songs.

<i>That's what
I do. I write.</i>

Screenplays mostly,
some songs.

You know, man, I like lyrics, you know.
Man, that's what I'm interested in.

Did you write that?

Hell, no.

You know I like that.
Who wrote that?

Really? It's
Lazarus wrote that.

He's deep into the
science of astrology.

<i>Sickest fuck
you'll ever meet.</i>

Uh huh. Where he at?

Him over there.
That's Lazarus.

<i>(Jacob) Get outta the way.
Outta the way.</i>

You can't...

Oh!

Watch out.

[speeds off]

<i>Hey, that's my car!</i>

[gun shots]



Ugh. Ugh.


[eery drone]

[door creeks open]


[expectant music]

[pants heavily]


<i>[steps of a running man]</i>

[pants heavily]


<i>Wool!</i>

<i>[music intensifies]</i>

[sound of steam pressure]

<i>(Jacob)
You know I'm gonna get you!</i>

<i>[drone]</i>

<i>(male voice)
Hey!</i>

<i>(male voice)
That way!</i>

This is car
12 do you read?

<i>(female over radio)
Roger, Detective.</i>

57 Poplar, 4th floor. Need
back up. I need cars now.

I need cars now.

<i>(female over radio)
Roger that.</i>

<i>[eery drone]</i>

<i>[elevator opens]</i>

Get back, MPD.

[gasps in horror]

<i>Close the door!</i>

[door creeks]

<i>(female voice)
No!</i>


Help!

I just wanna
talk. Let her go.

<i>(hostage)[cries]
No!</i>

[hostage screams]

[door bangs open]

Get outta the hall!

[hostage screams]

Get outta the way.
Outta the way!


[door bangs open]

[metallic thud]
Ugh!

All my life,

I've searched for
a worthy adversary.

Someone who
understands me.

Someone who
appreciates my work.

You're that one.

You think?

Love is law and
I ain't finished yet.

You know, buddy?
We can make this alright now.


<i>(Jacob)
Your adversary, alright.</i>

No!

<i>[police sirens]</i>

<i>(Jacob)
I got you now.</i>

For sure.

[eery drone]
You listen carefully.

I can speak in tongues.

<i>The language of the gods.</i>

I can speak any language,
ancient or otherwise.

Egyptian. Sanskrit.

Hebrew.

I can channel
spirits. Good and evil.

Make 'em do my bidding.

<i>I have not chosen you.</i>

But you have been chosen.

To walk with me.

<i>I will walk with you.</i>

<i>Before us,
looking as gods.</i>

<i>Angels.</i>

<i>Demons.</i>

<i>Monsters.</i>

But I will [inaudible]

<i>Until we get right.</i>


Where as once I was blind.

Now I can see.

Hallelujah.

<i>[toilet flushing]</i>

<i>(male voice)
Good morning.</i>

Mm-hm.

Damn.


<i>You were something
else last night, lady.</i>

<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

Oh, you know?

Good morning.

[kissing and chuckling]

[chuckles and growls]

What you doing?

Hm.

[metallic flick]

Ow. Ow!

<i>Get the fuck off me.</i>

<i>Get the fuck off!</i>

<i>I would have
killed you last night,</i>

but you were so sweet.

Ah!

Fresh.

Don't you move.

<i>[screams]</i>

<i>[approaching steps]
Hello?</i>

<i>[eery music]</i>

<i>(Coroner)
Agent Miller.</i>

[clears throat]
Sorry about the late notice, I know it's...

Pretty damn rude.

This investigation is being
supervised by my Agency,

<i>and we have ultimate authority over
everything related to the Grifter case.</i>

<i>Understand?</i>

Hm.

I'll take
that as a "yes."

You can do whatever you want.
Now let's get on with it.

Duffy! Bring in 42!

<i>[door opens]</i>

victims from the very first?

Yes.

And the count
to date is five?

<i>Six. Three females
and three males.</i>

And each death was a result of
blunt force trauma, a beating?

Yeah.

No inconsistencies
with the victim's wounds?

<i>The only inconsistency</i>

is amount of trauma between
the female victims and the male.

The women
were beat less?

<i>No. He toys with
the females more.</i>

<i>They received
much more trauma.</i>

Are you aware of why we're
interested in this case?

You want the truth?

<i>[audio]</i>

Wrong. Unfortunately,
it's not simple.

<i>[whistling and wheels squeak]</i>

It's the first
male victim.

He's a little ripe.

The flesh found
underneath the fingernails,

<i>It matches the DNA from the
second female victim, right?</i>

Makes sense, don't it?

Well, it does
and it doesn't.

Fingernails are used by females in
a defensive manner but not by a man.

That's textbook. A man will
do anything to defend himself.

<i>Scratch, kick, bite I've seen it all.
Don't seem strange to me.</i>

Well, the sample we
got made it seem strange.

<i>Under which fingernail
was it recovered?</i>

<i>Right index finger.</i>

I'm gonna need a close
up photo of that finger.

Why?

Just get it done. Someone
will pick it up tonight.

<i>Hey.</i>

What happened
to your arm?

Nothing.

I wanted to talk to you.

Okay.

Nights has an opening.

Nights always
has openings.

I think they can get me changing shifts.
Something different.

Just wanted to check it with
you first, see what you thought.

This move, it'll help
me become a detective.

<i>Like you.</i>

You should go for it.

<i>(Storm) Thought you went
back to Washington, little lady.</i>

What would make
you think that?

Since you're out of work. Jacob
nearly got this thing solved.

Jacob has a possible
suspect. Nothing more.

It can be a little bit
more than that, you see?

<i>I made out with his wallet.
Inslde I found a necklace.</i>

<i>I waiting for confirmation,
but my guess is,</i>

<i>the DNA from this matches the
dead prostitute, Jessica Trimble,</i>

<i>an individual named Lazarus
Jones, a convicted sex offender</i>

<i>[audio] day parole
for a long time now.</i>

That's why
he's the lead dog.

You gotta take notes.
[phone rings]

<i>Yeah?</i>

Why didn't
I get the lab reports?

Well, I just like to keep shit
kinda close to my vest, you know.

That's not protocol.

I'm not too good at protocol.

<i>Great. Thanks. Okay.</i>

<i>The DNA tests results confirmed
it Lazarus Jones is the Grifter.</i>

Where are you going?

Well, I'm gonna go get his ass.
You can come if you all wanna see.

<i>Storm, put out an APB.</i>

So, what you
got, little lady?

So you mind telling
me where we're going?

didn't that his license?

Sure enough. The address is
legit, but no doubt he's long gone.

Did you tell
the uniforms?

I didn't tell the uniforms. I
need that crime scene preserved.

Besides, we're
the Detectives.

[knocking on door]

<i>(Jacob)
Lazarus Jones. MPD!</i>

We're clear.

<i>Like I said,
he's long gone.</i>

<i>[eery drone]</i>

<i>(Frankie)
Jesus Christ.</i>

[chains clink]

<i>[eery drone continues]</i>

[distorted guitar notes
and flies buzz]

[soft clanging]

Lazarus!

FBI. We just wanna talk.

<i>[flapping of bird's wings]</i>

<i>[drone intensifies]</i>

Ugh.

<i>[drone intensifies]</i>

[door creeks open]

[dripping sound]

[door creeks]

Jacob!

[police sirens and
indistinct voices on radio]

<i>[sound of flashes]</i>

Something ain't
right, man.

Why would he bring
the body back here?

We should've moved
faster. We had him.

Yeah, we had him.

<i>That guy was gone the second he
dropped his wallet in that alley.</i>

Hmpf.

[Jacob sighs]

<i>I'm telling ya'. I think I've
just about got this cracked.</i>

<i>Lazarus is spelling out divination.
He's telling us the future</i>

with his
astrological riddles.

<i>He's timed his
killings on lunar phases.</i>

<i>On his last victims
he got full moon,</i>

<i>waning gibbous
and third quarter.</i>

<i>next is the waning
crescent. That's tonight.</i>

<i>What that tell ya?
He gonna kill tonight.</i>

Mm-hm.

Do we know where?

We're close, baby.

<i>This constellation's
called Arianna's crown.</i>

It has nine stars in it.

<i>I believe these stars somehow correlate
to the locations of the killings.</i>

<i>I just need
to figure out how.</i>

Listen, I'm gonna go home, spend some
solitary time trying to figure this out.

<i>Keep the Fed
busy, will ya?</i>

<i>Don't you worry.
I can handle that.</i>

No.

<i>[expectant music]</i>

<i>Still working on
that Grifter case?</i>

I am.

<i>Closing in on him?</i>

I definitely am.

<i>He was using the
distances between the stars</i>

in this constellation
of Arianna's crown.

<i>and mirroring that over
the city of Memphis,</i>

to a scale that
he made up himself.

If you put this here,

<i>[sighs] and I trace all
of the murder sites,</i>

<i>we place this over this
diagram of Arianna's crown,</i>

<i>that I found at his den, as you can
see, there's two starts missing.</i>

<i>His next kill is one
of these two locations.</i>

Now, once I cracked the last cypher,
I knew it could only be one place.

<i>[jazzy music]</i>

<i>[drone and
mangled guitar notes]</i>

Let me go!
Let me go!

[metallic slash]
Ugh!

<i>[echoes]

<i>[soft piano music]</i>

<i>[ominous drone]</i>

<i>[hollow swoosh]</i>

<i>[sudden scream]</i>

[muffled screams]

Ah!


<i>Ugh!</i>

Bitch.

<i>This is for
you, Agent Miller.</i>

Thank you.

You got the wrong
impression of him, kid.

<i>Jacob's a good man.</i>

That's your opinion.

Did you ever hear about the case
of the Cannibal of South County?

No.

<i>That was the first case Jacob
and I ever did together.</i>

I studied his file.
I don't remember that case.

Well, I fuckin' do. Seven
days and seven nights,

<i>searching non stop,</i>

until we finally cornered that bitch
in an apartment on the South Side.

And?

He was inside.

<i>(Storm) I wanted to call back up,
but Jacob wouldn't let me.</i>

<i>He said we have to move fast.</i>

<i>[chuckles]
That's typical.</i>

<i>I was like you.
I doubted him.</i>

<i>(Frankie)
You went in without back up?</i>

<i>You're damn right.
We didn't need none.</i>

<i>I had his back
and he had mine.</i>

I was scared. I ain't gonna
lie to you. I was scared.

<i>This man was
not only a killer,</i>

he was a mother
fucking cannibal.

And what happened?

<i>Well, we moved
in, real slow.</i>

Being real quiet.

Shit, we were so quiet, you
could hear a rat piss on a cat.

<i>And then, lightening.</i>

<i>He stood there real
calm, opened the door.</i>

Real slow
[creaking sound]

And then we saw him,
with his back towards us,

<i>kneeled down, over
a dead fucking clown.</i>

A clown?

He was bent over,
chewing on him.

<i>Eating his flesh
and sucking his bone,</i>

Like it was the last
barbecue rib at Rendezvous.

[all chuckle]

Shit.

Right in front of you?

<i>Right in front of us.</i>

<i>I was shaking
and I called out.</i>

Freeze! Mother fucker!

<i>And Jacob, he's standing there,
like ice running through his veins.</i>

<i>Gun covering down,
hammer starting ease back.</i>

<i>(Frankie) Son of a bitch.
Then what?</i>

He just stood there.

<i>Real calm. Like it didn't even make
no difference that we was even there.</i>

You're kidding me.

Nah, I wouldn't bullshit you.

He had this arm in his hand,
blood all over his fucking mouth,

And you know
what he said to us?

<i>What?</i>

Does this taste
funny to you?

[all laugh]

Good one. Let's go.

I get it, he was eating
a clown. Very funny.


Wait.

<i>Jacob's DNA was found on the
fingers of the latest victim.</i>

<i>[sexy jazz music]</i>

<i>I like that.</i>

Good. Okay.

Thank you.

<i>[ominous drone]</i>

Lazarus Jones. MPD. You're under
arrest. Put your hands in the air.

<i>[distorted guitar notes]</i>

<i>I said put them
in the air, boy!</i>

Do it!


You all get
outside. Go on!

<i>(Jacob) This is car 12.
I need back up.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
I wanna beat you silly.</i>

<i>Ready, baby?</i>

<i>(Jacob)
You're the tough guy.</i>

<i>(Jacob) Like to beat
helpless women?</i>

<i>Slap 'em?</i>

<i>Punch 'em?</i>

<i>Like this?</i>

<i>How about that?</i>

<i>You like it, sport?</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Want a piece of me?</i>

<i>Okay, baby.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
Take your best shot.</i>

<i>You feel that?</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

<i>You like to break
bones, right?</i>

<i>Ugh!</i>

[cracking sound]
Agh!

<i>(Jacob) I think
your arm's broken.</i>

Agh!

<i>(Officer)
Enough, Detective King.</i>

<i>We got him.</i>

<i>(Jacob) Make sure
Storm takes his confession.</i>

<i>(Jacob)
He's the Grifter.</i>

<i>(Lazarus)
No!</i>

<i>(Lazarus) My arm,
you fucker, my arm!</i>


<i>(Storm)
It just don't add up.</i>

<i>Maybe I'm just
not getting it.</i>

<i>The facts are the facts.
The lab results just came in.</i>

<i>The DNA found on the dead barmaid's
fingers at his farm match's Jacob's.</i>

Bullshit. That
can't be right.

The facts are all
pointing in one direction.

<i>I mean, you saw< it, he had
a fresh scratch on his arm.</i>

<i>And Lazarus has disappeared
that's if he even exists.</i>

that I would rather die than admit.

He is a genius. But I believe
he uses the same genius

<i>to catch the bad guys
to hide his own criminality.</i>

<i>Jacob killed
that barmaid.</i>

Listen, you lost
your damn mind.

<i>It's the perfect murder. The
killer investigates his own crime</i>

<i>and pins it on a serial killer
he's already investigated.</i>

<i>[soft piano music]</i>

<i>[soft step]</i>

Ah!

<i>You know, the sick thing is,
you killed her to get to me.</i>

All you had to do is call
my mother fucking name.


Yeah, You're gonna bend over and I'm
gonna stick my size 14 up your ass.

[flicks knife and chuckles]

Ah!

<i>Come on!</i>

Ah!

<i>Looks like old times,
ain't it Billy Joe.</i>

<i>Want some more?</i>

Come on, mother fucker.

<i>You like knives, right?</i>


<i>Where are you
going, boy?</i>

No appeal this time.

<i>Get up, ol' Billy.</i>

<i>[splits]</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

Come on here, Billy.

Ah!

Fuck you!

<i>(Billy)
You're gonna regret this.</i>

Here comes,
mother fucker!

Here comes! Ah!

[pants and gags]

You've killed me.

Holy shit [audio]

<i>[soft piano music]</i>

<i>[police sirens]</i>

Storm, come on. Let's go.

Jacob?

Right.

Jacob!

Jacob?

It's Celine.

She's dead.

Jacob?

<i>He's gone.</i>

Good job.

Sure.

<i>[soft piano music]</i>

<i>(OS Jacob) Storm, I'm
sorry about Celine.</i>

<i>Billy-music Joe killed her and
I took care of him, my way.</i>

<i>He won't be up on appeal.</i>

<i>You've been a great partner.</i>

<i>I know my methods are unconventional,
but hell, that's how I caught Lazarus.</i>

<i>Take his confession
for me, would ya?</i>

<i>I'll look you up
one day. Jacob.</i>

I just got off the
phone with your Captain.

He said Jacob booked
Lazarus about two hours ago.

<i>He confessed to everything.
Including framing Jacob.</i>

[birds chirp]

<i>[jazzy music]</i>

Papa.

Papa!

Wow.

[speaks Russian
and chuckles]

[speaks Russian]

<i>Alexei.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Sasha.</i>

Thank you,
papa.

Thank you.

[speaks Russian]

[speaks Russian]

Mm-hm.
