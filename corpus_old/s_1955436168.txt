<i>West Virginia Collegiate Institute is the</i>
best school for Negros in the state.

Itâ€™s the only school, past the eighth
grade, anywhere close to here.

Isosceles.. Scalene,

Equilateral,

Rhombus...

Trapezoid,

Katherineâ€™s in the sixth grade.

They want to take her early.

Tetrahedron,

<i>Dodecahedron.</i>

<i>Theyâ€™re offering a full scholarship.</i>

 All you have to do is get there.

Ms. Coleman.

Why donâ€™t you solve the equation
on the board?

<i>We took up the collection amongst the
teachers and such,</i>

It's not a lot.

But itâ€™s enough to help you to
settle in the end.

Thatâ€™s more than kind, Ms. Sumner.

If the product of two terms is zero,

then common sense says at least
one of the two terms

 has to be zero to start with!

So, if you move all the terms over
to one side,

you can put the quadratics into a form
that can be factored,

Allowing that side of the equation
to equal zero.

Once youâ€™ve done that,
itâ€™s pretty straight forward from there...

<i>In all my years of teaching,</i>

<i>Iâ€™ve never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.</i>

<i>- Katherien!</i>
<i>- Hurry on, now. Love!</i>

<i>You have to go.</i>

Let Mommy take you in.

<i>You have to see what she becomes.</i>

OK! Try and turn it over, now!

Katherine?!

Mary!

Somebody!

Katherine!?  Quit staring off into space!
And turn the damn car over!

I got it.

Iâ€™m not deaf!

I wonder some times.

Here it goes.

Yeah!
It's the starter.

Itâ€™s definitely the starter.

That starterâ€™s startinâ€™ to make us late.

Weâ€™re going to be unemployed driving around
in this balloon of junk to work everyday.

Youâ€™re welcome to walk the 16 miles.

Or sit on the back of the bus.

I wonâ€™t do neither.

 Iâ€™ll hitchhike.

Girls!

No crime in a broken down car.

No crime being Negro either.

Button it up, Mary! Nobody wants to
go to jail behind your mouth.

Iâ€™ll do my best, sugar.

Not a great place for the three of
yaâ€™ll to be havinâ€™ car trouble.

We didnâ€™t pick the place, Officer.
 It picked us.

You beinâ€™ disrespectful?

No, sir.

You have identification on ya?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

 Weâ€™re just on our way to work.

At Langley.

NASA, sir.

We do a great deal of the calculating

Getting our rockets into space.

All three?
Yes, sir.

Yes, officer.

NASA!
Thatâ€™s somethin'!

 Had no idea they hired...

There're quite a few women,

 Working in the Space Program.

Damn Russians are watching us right now.

Sputniks.

You girls ever meet those Astronauts?

The Mercury 7?

Absolutely!

Yes, sir.
We work with those gentlemen all the time.

Those boys are the best we got.

I'm sure of that!
Yeah!

We gotta get a man up there
 before the Commies do.

Yes!
Absolutely.

Whole damn countryâ€™s counting on â€˜em.

Thatâ€™s for certain

Hard to be of service broken down on
the side of the road, though.

Right! Right!

Well, you need a tow or somethinâ€™?

No, thank you, Officer.
 I think I got it, Just give me that..

Just need a ...

To bypass the starter...

She is good in this stuff!

Thatâ€™a girl!

Weâ€™re all set.

Hell. Least I can do is give ya
an escort.

Imagine yaâ€™ll are
running late to work.

Oh, no sir! We wouldnâ€™t
want to bother you.

That would be wonderful, Officer.

Thank you so much, sir.

Follow me!
I'm driving!

Hurry up, Dorothy!
Before he changes his mind!

We're coming!
Hold your horses!

Yes!

Mary! Slow down!  Youâ€™re so close!
Well, be quiet. He said to follow him!

He didnâ€™t mean you hit him behind!

Dear Lord..
I donâ€™t even know where to begin!

Oh! Iâ€™ll tell you where to begin!

three negro women are chasing
a white police office

down the highway in Hampton, Virginia

1961.

Ladies, that there is
a God ordained miracle!

Handsome officer!
I'm frightened, pus!

Show me!

No, exactly!

Ascend angle: 46.56.

118 seconds.

Second stage. Success.

Korabl-Sputnik-4 is orbital.

Orbital entry is established.

Russian orbital entry is established.

Jim Webb.

Yes, Mr. President !

We certainly are, sir.

It looks like they've achieved at least
one orbit.. Maybe two!

Zvezdochka is ready to go again.
So is our comrade, Ivan.

A brave space traveler.

We have proven  life can be sustained
in space.

Now, we will be first to send a human

A damn dog!

And a damn mannequin!

And then a 1.6 megaton
RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead

drops down in the
middle of Des Moines.

Well, thatâ€™s a pretty big jump, sir.

What?

Just there's that..
Who the hell is he?

Paul Stafford.
Our Lead Engineer, Mr. Webb.

I think what he meant to say
is that speculation, at least

on our side of the equation
by definition, can be..

Just a little dangerous.

Dangerous?

You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

Inaction, and indecision.

Russians have a spy
satellite lapping the planet,

taking pictures
of God knows what!

The President is demanding
an immediate response.

No more delays.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob.

Doesnâ€™t matter,
just get us up there, Harrison

We canâ€™t justify a space program

that doesn't put anything in space.

How did that feel in there, Paul?

Do you think you enlightened
the Administrator?

No! He didnâ€™t look enlightened to me.

He look enlightened to you, Sam?
Not particularly.

And just so you know, heâ€™s not
wrong about what he said in there.

You know that, right?

Because now that they can get up there,
a bomb will follow.

Thatâ€™s what happens to all our good ideas.

Imaginary still.. Wait!

Whereâ€™s the machine?

Any day now, Mr. Harrison.

Any day now.
Yes, sir.

Whatâ€™s it called?

The initials...
There. IBM.

International business machine.

Space is a business!

I need a mathematician.

Iâ€™ll put in another request, sir.
Another request.

Jesus Christ! We donâ€™t have
a single person, in this entire building,

that can handle Analytic Geometry?

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been told.

Well, tell me something else, Ruth.
Like weâ€™re going to find such a person

before the Russians plant a flag
on the damn moon.

Ladies! ladies!

If you're retarded, you don't get
Mrs. Simone,

And if you don't get Mrs. Simone,
you don't have a job.

Eleanor. Data Reduction, Building 202.

Date Reduction?!

Well. Youâ€™re welcome to join the
charmers in Magneto-plasmadynamics.

Oh! No, maâ€™am.

Thank you, Data Reductionâ€™s just fine.

Mary.
Present.

The Mercury 7 prototype
has arrived for testing.

Mr. Zielinskiâ€™s requesting you.

For permanent assignment.

Are you serious?
Get moving.

Oh! Thank you, Jesus!

Thank you, Jesus! Oh! Thank you.
Mary!

Keep it inside, hon.

I'm sorry, Dor

All right, Mrs. late!

You'll also be splendid in script.

Mrs. Mitchell.

Weâ€™re on double time this morninâ€™, girls.

I need these calculations before lunch.

The Space Task Group needs a computer,
ASAP.

Someone with a handle on
Analytic Geometry.

We canâ€™t fill the position outta
the East Group.

Permanent or temp?

Everythingâ€™s temporary, Dorothy.

You have someone?
Oh! Yes, maâ€™am.

Katherineâ€™s the gal for that.

She can handle any numbers you put
in front of her.

Iâ€™ll check her credentials.

Didnâ€™t think of cominâ€™ all the way
down here.

Here.
Please spread these out.

Mrs. Mitchell!

If I could.

My application for supervisor, maâ€™am.

Was just wondering if theyâ€™re still
considering me for that position.

Yes.

Well, the official word is: no.

Theyâ€™re not assigninâ€™ a permanent
supervisor for the Colored Group.

May I ask why?

I donâ€™t know â€œwhy.â€

I didnâ€™t ask â€œwhy.â€

We need a Supervisor, maâ€™am.

We havenâ€™t had one since Ms. Jansen got sick
It's been almost a year.

Things are workinâ€™ just fine as is.

I do the work of a Supervisor.

Well.
Thatâ€™s NASA, for ya.

Fast with rocket ships.
Slow with advancement.

Get those trajectories calcs worked out.

We need â€˜em for the Redstone test.

Mach 1 tunnel test, T-minus one minute.

No shoe is worth your life

One.. One moment!

Shut it down.

If we alter the exterior from smooth

to corrugated, the capsule would
have more stability,

But the friction,
itâ€™s under during reentry..

 most shield erosion occurs

on the posterior side abutting
the retro-boosters.

Conclusion?

The area closest to the boosters
is closest to the heat.

Coupled with rising temperatures
on reentry,

 the contacts soften.

We could consider another fastener
other than bolts.

Yes!

Yes.

Thereâ€™s another opening in
the Engineer Training Program.

Flat head rivets would reduce wind drag.

Mary! a person with an engineerâ€™s
mind should be an engineer.

You canâ€™t be a Computer
the rest of your life.

Mr. Zielinski.

 Iâ€™m a Negro woman.

Iâ€™m not gonna to entertain the impossible!

Then Iâ€™m a polish Jew whose parents
died in a Nazi prison camp.

Now Iâ€™m standing beneath a space ship,

thatâ€™s going to carry an astronaut
to the stars.

I think we can say,
we are living the impossible.

Let me ask you..

If you were a white male,

Would you wish to be an engineer?

I wouldnâ€™t have to.
 Iâ€™d already be one.

Skirts must be worn past the knee.

Sweaters are preferred to blouses.

No jewelry.

A simple pearl necklace is the exception.

Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison.

Director of the Space Task Group.

write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

Donâ€™t talk to Mr. Harrison lest
he talks to you.

Not many Computers last
more than a few days,

Heâ€™s been through a dozen
in as many months.

Come on! Keep up!

I think it's a little faster to run here!

Your clearance.

Theyâ€™ve never had a colored in here before,
Katherine.

Donâ€™t embarrass me.

This wasnâ€™t emptied last night.

Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m not the..

Curses on me!

Excuse me, maâ€™am.
Mr. Harrisonâ€™s Computer reporting.

Take the desk in the back.
 Iâ€™ll get you work in a..

Bit.

Mr. Harrison wonâ€™t warm up to you,
donâ€™t expect it.

Do your work, keep your head down.

Thank you.

Go on.  Get settled.

Well..

Why are we still losing shingles off
the heat shield?

Well, Weâ€™re working with a
prototype of the capsule, Al.

There is one third the size..
And I get that. So..

Well, do we need to turn
our million dollar fan down, Karl?

Turn it down?
No, I don't think...

Hey! That was a joke.

Paul.  If the heat shield comes off,

What'do gonna happens to our astronaut?

I know.

So weâ€™re gonna..

Then come up with a solve, right?

Yes, sir. Weâ€™re working on it.

Ruth. Whatâ€™s the status on my Computer?

Sheâ€™s right behind you, Mr. Harrison.

Does she handle how's Analytic Geometry?

Absolutely.  And she speaks.

Yes, sir. I do.

Which one?
<i>- Both.</i>

Geometry and speaking.

Ruth. Give me that.

Do you think you..

You think you can find me the Frenet frame
for this data,

Using the GramSchmidt...

With Orthogonalization algorithm.
 Yes, sir.

I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

OK. Good.

Good.  Then, Iâ€™m going to need it
by the end of the day.

Yes.

Iâ€™m also going to ask you to check
Mr. Staffordâ€™s math

as well as others on this
floor from time to time.

I can.. I can handle'm all, Al.

Iâ€™m sure you can, Paul.
Iâ€™m sure all of you can.

 But if that were the case,

Shingles wouldnâ€™t be flying off the
heat shield, now would they.

Excuse me. Can I have
everyone's attention for a moment?

Thank you. Just a..

Just to be clear..

In 14 days the Mercury 7
will be here for training.

And I have no doubt in my mind
that theyâ€™re going to be

Asking us questions about our work.

I think that's a pretty reason
we're giving. We're putting a human..

on top of a missile and
shooting him into space?

And itâ€™s never been done before.

And because itâ€™s never been done.
Everything we do

between now and
then is going to matter.

Itâ€™s going to matter to their wives.

To their children.

I believe itâ€™s going to matter to
the whole damn country.

So this Space Task Group will be
as advertised.

America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

will not gonna have a problem

with having their work checked.
Will they, Paul?

No, sir.

Good.  So letâ€™s have an amen, damnit

Amen.

Amen.

All right!

My numbers are spot on.

Iâ€™ll double check them, sir.
No problem.

Iâ€™m not gonna be able to..
Work on what you can read.

The rest is classified.
You donâ€™t have clearance.

Excuse me...

May I ask you where the ladiesâ€™ room is?

Sorry, I have no idea where
your bathroom is?

Yes, sir.

Ah! Yes.

Ruth!
Yes, Mr. Harrison.

Whereâ€™s that girl go with the numbers?

On a... break.

We take breaks now.

My God, where have you been?
Are you finished yet?

Almost.
He said about the end of the day?

The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

I need those done first.

He wants those done first.

OK !
Get going.

Mr. Harrison.

Oh! Yeah, just settle up,
you know.

And Staffordâ€™s heat shield calcs?

Itâ€™s hard to be sure, sir.

Hard to be sure.

You know what weâ€™re doing here?

Trying to put a man in space, sir.

Thatâ€™s right.

Thatâ€™s right.  So you can
throw that in the trash.

Excuse me?

I said you can throw it away!

Here.

It's not an insult to your work.
It's just..

.. Obsolete.
That's how fast things are moving around here.

If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

What Iâ€™m asking you to do.. what Iâ€™m
asking everyone one in that room,

 all my... geniuses,
is to look beyond the numbers.

To look around them.

Through them.

 For answers to questions we donâ€™t even
know to ask.

Math that doesnâ€™t yet exist.

Because without it,
weâ€™re not going anywhere.

I mean, weâ€™re staying on the ground.
Weâ€™re not...

flying into space. Weâ€™re not..

circling the earth.  And weâ€™re certainly
not touching the moon.  And in my mind..

In my mind, Iâ€™m already there.

Are you?

Yes, sir.

Good.

 Because I donâ€™t need another smart girl
with a adding machine.

Can I go, sir?

Go? Yeah. Go, yeah.
Go home.

Yes, you can go.

<i>..I'm saying this is so much.
I'm not saying that.. I..</i>

Weâ€™ve been waiting for hours.

Next time you take the bus.

Sheâ€™s in a mood.

I havenâ€™t been late one day in ten years.
Havenâ€™t been out sick.

Havenâ€™t complained.  My workâ€™s on time.
Itâ€™s done right.  Itâ€™s done well.

Itâ€™s not fair, thatâ€™s a fact.

Whatâ€™s not fair is having
the responsibility of the Supervisor,

but not the title or the pay.

Watching you two moved on.

Now donâ€™t get me wrong.

Any upward movement is movement for us all

It just isnâ€™t movement for me.

Truth be told, Dorothy, I donâ€™t really know
if I can keep up in that room.

 Iâ€™ll be back with the Computers in a week,

or out of a job entirely.

Oh, please! Youâ€™re better with the numbers
than anyone in the cabin and you know it.

Make that pencil move as fast as
your mind does, youâ€™ll be fine.

And you. Have some respect! Get
your damn feet off my dash board.

This isnâ€™t your jump living room.

I sound like a supervisor, donâ€™t I?

A mean, ole salty one.

Riddled with authority.
No question.

You donâ€™t mess with, Mrs. Vaughan.

Turn that music up!

Goodnight, Katherine!
Bye, Kath!

Goodnight, ladies!
See you in the morning.

Here, baby!
Hello, mamma.

 I was fixing to call the National Guard.

Sorry, Momma.

 New assignment.

Space Task Group.

Oh! No, girl! This how's important?

Itâ€™s a promotion?

Maybe a slight promotion.

But you want the job, right?

I think so.

Itâ€™s a challenge. But..

Well, it's nothing you canâ€™t do handle,
Katherine.

Thank you, mamma.

Are they asleep yet?
No. Pretending to be.

They're not pretending well, enough!

Thank you, mamma.
Loving.

This is my bed!

What are you doing!?

Itâ€™s not fair how Joylette gets to
sleep by herself â€˜cause sheâ€™s the oldest.

Yes. it is fair!

Constance, Kathy, sit.

Now, I understand you want to be grown.
And have your own space

 So who wants to sleeps in that bed,

 in Joyletteâ€™s place,

will also do the dishes,

take out the trash,
and do all of Joyletteâ€™s choirs.

Thatâ€™s okay.  Never mind.

Sheâ€™s not so terrible to share with.

OK.

Now donâ€™t let me come home, find you
like this again. You hear me!

It's supposed to been asleep.
A long time ago.

We just wanna to say â€œgoodnight.â€

Youâ€™ve been gone for 300 hours.

I work full time now.  You all know that.

I have to be the mommy and the daddy.

I miss your father as much as anyone

Heâ€™s with his angels.

Yes. Heâ€™s with all his angels.

And heâ€™s watching over us.

Every minute. OK?

That's why we have to be strong.
All right?

Yes, Mamma.
Yeah! Get some rest, OK?

Mamma?
Yes, baby.

Are the Russians fixing to attack us?

Whereâ€™d you get that from?

We had to hide under our desks today.
All scrunched up.

OK, baby. That's called a drill.

It means ..

You practice safety, just in case
something happens.

Truth is, we donâ€™t know what
theyâ€™re doing up there.

You're going up to space too?
No, baby.  But..

Iâ€™m going to do what I can to help those
brave men get there. Yes, I'm.

You can fly to space too if you wanted to,
Mamma.  You can be an astronaut.

Did you draw this?
Yes, mamma.

Is that me?

Yes, it is.

Oh, well. Goodness! I love you, baby.

Me too!
I know, I know. Come here.

All right!
Now this time...really go to bed.

I love you.
Goodnight.

Goodnight.
I love my picture, baby.

Praise God!
Praise God!

Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Praise God that change is coming.

From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference,

to the good Reverend Dr. King,

<i>Hallelujah!</i>

to the students sitting in

at lunch counters in North Carolina.

His faith in us has no limit!

The good Lord..

 has our very own women..

workinâ€™ on rocket ships!

And we have National Guardsmen

defending our freedom!

Give a shout of praise for Colonel
Jim Johnson.

 Returning home by the grace of God,

to set up a National Guard unit

 right here in Hampton.

Can I get a â€œHallelujahâ€ in here?!
Hallelujah!

I just don't understand..
I just.. I don't..

I don't understand.

I don't want to talk
about this again, OK?

A female engineer?

A female engineer.

Weâ€™re Negro, baby.  Ainâ€™t no
such thing.  Understand it.

Itâ€™s not like that there, Levi.

You canâ€™t â€œapplyâ€ for freedom.  Freedom
is never granted to the oppressed.

Itâ€™s got to be demanded.  Taken.

Stop quoting your slogans at me.

Thereâ€™s more than one way to
achieve something.

I donâ€™t want any greens.

I tell you about interrupting?

Yeah! Try this, baby.

You need the greens too.

Kid needs to eat vegetables.

You would know that, if you were home.

You better settle down, Levi Jackson.

Less you want this femaleâ€™s mind
right here, front of everybody.

All Iâ€™m saying

Donâ€™t play the fool.

I donâ€™t want to see you get hurt.

NASAâ€™s never given you gals your due,

having a couple issued degrees
wonâ€™t change that.

 Civil rights ainâ€™t always civil.

I don't wanna any greens either.

No lip, little miss.  Your brother
gets them, and so do you.

I knew heâ€™s planning on staying
in the area.

Well. Thatâ€™s good for him.

Katherine,
go find your way over there.

That Colonel Jimâ€™s a tall glass of water!

That he is.
Tall. Strong. Commanding.

Perhaps he's like that day...and night.
Mary!

Itâ€™s Sunday!
Please, have some shame.

I will not.

Mm. I think heâ€™s smiling over here.
At you!

Then, Iâ€™m not smiling back.
Youâ€™re all teeth right now.

I am not!

Heâ€™s coming over!
Now, whyâ€™s he doing that

Because Maryâ€™s waving at him!
No! Ladies, I'm not..

Too late.  Fix your hair on the side.

Iâ€™m Dorothy Vaughan. This is Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

Yes, maâ€™am. We did meet each other.

And this is Katherine Goble.

Sheâ€™s not married.  Sheâ€™s a widow.

 With three little girls,

so well-behaved.
Angels on earth, if you'd like to call.

Dorothy, slice-a pie?
Iâ€™d love one

Excuse me!

You've already have slice-a pie!

Well, I was just..

fixing my three babies some plates.
May I help?

Sure.
Ah! For salad!

Pastor mentioned youâ€™re a â€œComputerâ€
at NASA

Yes!
Whatâ€™s that entail?

We calculate the mathematics
necessary to enable

launch and landing for
the Space Program.

Pretty heady stuff!
Yes, it is.

They let women handle that sort of..

 Yes. Not what I mean!

What do you mean?

I am.. just surprised something so..
taxing..

Mr. Johnson!

If.. you at that quit talking right now!

Iâ€™m not meaning any disrespect

Iâ€™ll have you know, I was
the first Negro female

student at West Virginia
University Graduate School.

On any given day,
I analyze the manometer levels

for air displacement
friction and velocity.

and compute over 10,000
calculations by cosine,

square root and lately
Analytic Geometry.

By hand. There are 20 bright,

highly capable Negro women in the
West Computing Group,

and weâ€™re proud to be doing our
part for the country.

So, yes..

They let women do some things at NASA,
Mr. Johnson.

And itâ€™s not because we wear skirts..

Itâ€™s because we wear glasses!

Have a good day!

Welcome.
Welcome, marina.

Right here, Gentlemen!

That's Alan Shepard.

 US Navy pilot.  He could be
the first man in space.

Yes!
Scott Carpenter and Walter Schirra.

Also Navy pilots.

All under 5â€™11â€, 180 lbs.

IQs over 130.

And handsome must
be a requirement too.

How can you possibly be
ogling these white men?

Itâ€™s equal rights. I have the
right to see fine in every color.

He must be  John Glenn.

He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

Gentlemen, if we may..
much to see around here.

Heck, havenâ€™t shaken all the hands yet.

We have a fairly tight itinerary, Colonel.
Ruth, it's fine.

He's coming straight.
look around ahead.

Ladies. Didnâ€™t wanna
run off without saying hello...

 They seem to be
in a big rush around her.

The Russians certainly arenâ€™t
slowing down any.

It's a big deal â€˜frigerator, how
the heck they beat us into space?

What do you ladies do for NASA?

Calculate your trajectories, sir.
Launch and landing.

I canâ€™t get anywhere without the numbers.
No, sir.

Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.

Engineering.  And I'm proud as
the devil to be workinâ€™ with you.

Thank you, Mary.

John!

Now, let's take this side!
Yes, sir.

Guys!

Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm launch

and landing for the
Redstone Rocket test.

I cannot work on what I cannot see,
Mr. Stafford.

Itâ€™s illegible.

These numbers ere even
confirmed by two engineers

in this department, and myself.

This is more-or
less a dummy check.

This one, like make a two. Make
a double. OK? Get it?

No one thought to measure these things.

I'm afraid, not. Sir.

Would you like us to stop?

No.  No, just..

I see, no. Just keep going.

That..

Use.. Use the big hammer!
Yes, sir.

Come! Use the big hammer.
You know that, man. Let's go!

Ma'am.

Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy.

You need to be workinâ€™,
not walkinâ€™.

Oh! Itâ€™s break time, maâ€™am.
No trouble at all.

And since you made the trip...

you can take that batch over there!

Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

You need somethinâ€™ else?

Yes, ma'am.

I was wondering if you knew what
theyâ€™re building in the Tech Wing.

Itâ€™s called an IBM.

A mainframe machine.

Apparently, it can do our calculations
in a fraction-a the time.

Guess thatâ€™s good for NASA.

Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

Excuse me!

Is that correct?

Yeah!

Whose work is that?

I said, whose work is that?!

Katherine Goble, sir.

How did you know the Redstone
couldnâ€™t support orbital flight?!

Thatâ€™s classified information

Itâ€™s top secret.

Well, it's my secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing,

for sub-orbital flight, but it canâ€™t
handle the weight of the capsule,

and push it into space.

Numbers donâ€™t lie.

And you figured out all that with this?

 Half the data is redacted!

Whatâ€™s there tells the story
if you read between the lines.

The distance from launch to orbit, we know.
Then mass we know.

The Mercury Capsule weight, we know.

And the speeds are there.. in the data.

You did the math.

Yes, sir.

I looked beyond.

Then how did you know about the
Atlas rocket?

Thatâ€™s not math.

That dataâ€™s not here. Like he said,
 itâ€™s classified.

I held it up to the light.

You held it up to the light?
Yes, sir.

Yep.  There it is.

Atlas!

Whatâ€™s your name?

Katherine Goble.

Are you a spy, Katherine?
Am I what?

I'm saying, are you a Russian spy?
No, sir.

Iâ€™m not Russian.

Sheâ€™s not Russian, sir.

All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

Letâ€™s get her everything she needs
to work on Shepardâ€™s trajectories.

Without redaction.
Are we clear enough?

Right.
Are we sure about this?

Whatâ€™s the issue, Paul?
You heard her.

Sheâ€™s not a spy.

I.. I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea.

You know what I think is a good idea?

Darker ink.

I think darker ink is a good idea.
Ruth, could pass it along?

Yes, sir.

Thank you, Katherine!
Thank you, sir.

This interrogation is over!

You can probably get to the
moon and back with these.

Just not the bathroom.

Least theyâ€™re not
blind to what you do.

Itâ€™s not going to matter soon.

This IBMâ€™s going to put us all out of work.

What can we do about it?

One thing to do!

Learn all we can.
Make ourselves valuable.

Somewhere down the line a human beingâ€™s
going to have to hit the buttons.

That's right.

Oh, mercy!

Well, she must be lost.

NASA doesnâ€™t commission females
for the Engineer Training Program.

That position is available to any
qualified applicant.

Right. Except you donâ€™t have
the educational requirements.

I have a Bachelors Degree in
Mathematics and Physical Sciences.

It's the same degree as most
engineers around here.

Well, we now require advanced extension
courses through the University of Virginia.

Itâ€™s in the Employee Handbook.
An addendum.

Case you havenâ€™t read it!

Every time we have a chance to get
ahead, youâ€™ll move the finish line.

I just follow the rules around here.
And I expect..

everyone who works for
me to follow them as well.

There are no special circumstances
for anyone.

You all should be thankful,
you have jobs at all.

â€œFor those that cannot attend classes

 at the University of Virginia,

Advanced Extension Courses are
available at Hampton High School.â€

Thatâ€™s still a segregated school. Mary!

Virginia acts like Brown vs. the Board
of Education never happened.

Theyâ€™ll never gonna allow a â€œcoloredâ€ woman
just take classes at an all white school!

Sounds about right.
Thatâ€™s all youâ€™re gonna say?

Well, Iâ€™m not going to sit
here all day and listen to you

complain about the way things
are which are as a play cards.

Petition the court. Fight for what
you want. But quit talking about it

Iâ€™ve been complaining?
For days!

Ladies!

Not one more peep about work.

Do you need vin?

<i>Katherine,</i>
come on!

You!

Yeah! I needed this!
Thank you!

Donâ€™t give her any more again.

I canâ€™t.  She drank it all.

Yes.
I'm fine!

Iâ€™m as fine as Iâ€™ve ever been.

Youâ€™re as drunk as youâ€™ve ever been.

Come on! let's dance, girls.

Come on, Kath!
Let's dance.

Go dance, Katherine.

Come on!

Just teach me how!

Keep going, here! All right.
Slow! Here slow down.

Donâ€™t pay attention to all that. Weâ€™re
not part of that trouble. Go on!

Leonard..

We must have done it.

We donâ€™t want any trouble in here.

Oh! Iâ€™m not here for any trouble. Ma'am.

What are you here for?

A book.

You have books in the colored section.

It doesnâ€™t have what Iâ€™m looking for.

Well, I suggest the way it is.

Well, you know better...

Get your hands off my boys.
Donâ€™t touch them.

You have a blessed day.

Separate and equal are
two different things.

Just cause itâ€™s the way
 doesnâ€™t make it right.

Understand?

Yes, mamma.

You act right, you are right.
Thatâ€™s for certain. Understand?

Yes, mamma.

You took that book, mamma?

Son, I pay taxes.

And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

You take something what
you already paid for.

FORTRAN is a new and exciting language..

Used by programmers to communicate
with computers...

It's exciting, as it's the way
of the future.

And everybody smile.

Everybody smile.

Make a wish!

Leonard, you need to get you a job now.

Two girls!

Well, look at that.
Look at what?

What a surprise.

I'll say.

Howard must have invited him.
Mmm. Hmmm.

I need to go and see the boys.

I believe I owe you an apology.

What was that it?

Can I make it while we dance?

Iâ€™m afraid I simply misspoke the other
day, Mrs. Goble.

Iâ€™ve been away for a long time.

 I imagine, Iâ€™m just out of practice.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah. I was hoping you would allow me
to start over?

Mm-hmm.

So, the thing is..

I have an interest in getting
to know you better.

Mm-hmm.

You are one tough customer. Huh?

You haven't said â€œyouâ€™re sorryâ€ yet!

Right.
Of course.

 Iâ€™m sorry, Katherine.

For what, Jim?

Underestimating you.

Or any woman like you.

Though I canâ€™t imagine thereâ€™s many.

Thatâ€™s good practice, right there.

<i>We interrupt this musical programming
with breaking news.</i>

The Soviet news agency has announced
that Russian cosmonaut,

Yuri Gagarin, has become
the first man in space.

Gagarin completed one full orbit around
the planet in 108 minutes.

Stay tuned to the station for more
details, as they become available.

Man!
Does that pussies pad look here?

<i>.. a versatile one rocket,
and then the Russian cosmonaut</i>

<i>Reentering Russian Air Space at 7:55 UTC.

<i>that man could survive orbital space wide.
Gagarin was a..</i>

Well..

 They beat the pants off us.
Letâ€™s go..

Just learn how to fly to space.

<i>And he's been declared a national hero.</i>

<i>This is a day of unprecedented triumph
for the Russian national program,</i>

<i>And a crushing blow for America
in the race for space.</i>

I want to thank everyone for staying.

I know itâ€™s late, and
after what we just saw...

I'm sure everyoneâ€™s
probably anxious to go home.

But before we do, I just have
to ask a question...

The same one..

I've been asking myself all the way
over here, which is.

How the hell we find ourselves
in second place in a two man race?

Anybody?

 Paul?

I think Glenn said it pretty well.
Theyâ€™re just outworking us.

And the reason I have to..

think that is because I refuse to believe
that the Russians are smarter than us,

or that they have more technology.
Or that they care more.

But I donâ€™t know?  Is that possible?

Is it possible that it actually means
more to them?

Weâ€™re in the fight of our lives, people.

This isnâ€™t some epic joyride!

I just saw seven faces..

Who werenâ€™t sure that
we can get there.

Here's our problem.

And so, as of right now,

Thereâ€™s only two things you
need to know going forward

One is, staying here working late
that's gonna be a fact of life.

And two, don't expect your
paychecks reflect the extra time

is gonna take to catch
up and pass those bastards.

For those of you that canâ€™t
work that way, I understand'em

 and thank you
for what you've done.

For everyone else,

I suggest you call your wives..

and tell them how itâ€™s gonna be.

Iâ€™ll start with mine.

<font color="#ffff80">Redstone Unnamed Rocket Test</font>

Sam! Go on!
Yes, sir

End of the day.

Tell me. we're looking good?

Try!

So am I be there? Switch the latch!
I'm taking a watch!

Weâ€™re honored to serve our country.
So, we donâ€™t think about..

Danger.
No time to be scared.

we have a job to do

<i>Mrs. Jackson!</i>

Colored seats are at the back
of the courtroom.

Thank you, ma'am.

So, which one of you wants to go first?

The IBM 7090 Data Processing System,

It has a capability of solving of over
24,000 multiplications

per second!

Holy Moses, thatâ€™s lightning fast!
Theyâ€™ll never get it to work.

Itâ€™ll run eventually. And when it does
we have to know how to program it.

Unless youâ€™d rather be out of a job?
No!

Mr. Z.

I got a court date.

Computing uses it as high speed storage
unit and..

And information holding device.

We have a file!

And I'll do it for you!

Now, listen! Hold the spark!

Beautiful!

Ruth!
Yes, sir.

Get the Cape on the line.
Shepardâ€™s trajectories need to be updated.

Where is she?!

Where the hell have you been?

Everywhere I look you're not
where I need you to be.

And it's not my imagination. So where
the hell do you go everyday?

To the bathroom, sir.

The bathroom!

To the damn bathroom!

For 40 minutes a day!?

What do you do in there!?

We are T-minus zero here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

Thereâ€™s no bathroom for me here.

What do you mean thereâ€™s
no bathroom for you here?

Here is no bathroom!

There are no colored bathrooms
in this building,

or any building outside the West Campus.

Which is half a mile away!
 Did you know that?

I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself!

And I canâ€™t use one of the handy bikes.

Picture that, Mr. Harrison?

My uniform...

Skirt below the knees and my heels.

And simple necklace pearls.
Well, I don't own pearls.

Lord knows you donâ€™t pay the
coloreds enough to afford pearls!

And I work like a dog day and night,

living on coffee from a pot none of
you want me to touch!

So, excuse me..

if I have to go to the restroom
a few times a day!

There you have it!

No more colored restrooms.

No more white restrooms.

Just plain old toilets.

Go wherever you damn well please.

Preferably closer to your desk.

At NASA...

We all pee the same color!

Heard you were fighting the flu.
Thought you could use some soup?

Hot meal for the girls.

Come on, in.

Excuse me!

OK, ladies!
Let's say grates..

Ah! Yes!

Dear Lord!
Thank you for this meal..

We ask that you blessed this food,
that may you bless it to our bodies.

In Jesus name, we pray.

Amen.

Alan Shepard Launch</font>

It's a history day at Cape Canaveral,
and here we can expect Alan Shepard on

Freedom 7 will be launched in the space
in altitude about 116 miles an hour.

Dorothy! Come on or you'll miss it!
I'm coming.

Any day now, Capcom.

<i>Fix your little problem,

Roger that, Freedom 7.
<i>Standby.</i>

Move to final countdown sequence.

Moving to final countdown sequence.

<i>Copy that.</i>

<i>And weâ€™re at T-minus

We choose to go to the Moon in this decade
and do the other things..

not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

.. Because we should all thank President
Kennedy for continued job security.

Gus Grissomâ€™s up next.

Another suborbital flight with a Redstone.

Our last shot before we strap
Glenn to the Atlas..

And.. pray we can get him back down.

Yes, and I imagine heâ€™d like us to have
the math figured out beforehand.

Good work, gentlemen.

Go have dinner with your kids.
Then...

 letâ€™s get back to work.

I think itâ€™s high time that
I kissed you, Kathe.

Oh.  And whyâ€™s that?

Figure youâ€™re attracted to me
the same as I to you.

Is that right?

Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

Havenâ€™t kissed a man in a long time.

Almost forgot how to.

Mary Jackson.

 Petition to attend courses at
Hampton High School.

Good morning, your honor.

Hampton High School is a white school,
Mrs. Jackson.

Yes, your Honor.
Iâ€™m aware of that.

Virginia is still a segregated state.

Regardless of what the Federal
Government says, or regardless what..

Supreme Court says our law..

is the law.

Your Honor,
if I may.

I believe there are special circumstances
to be considered.

What would warrant
a colored woman attendinâ€™ a white school?

May I approach the bench, sir?

Your Honor,

You of all people should understand
the importance of being first.

Howâ€™s that, Mrs. Jackson?

Well, you were the first in your family

 to serve in the Armed Forces.

 US Navy.

 The first to attend University.

George Mason.

And the first State Judge to be re-commissioned
<i>by three consecutive Governors.</i>

Youâ€™ve done some research.

Yes, sir.

Whatâ€™s the point?

<i>The point is, your Honor...</i>

No Negro woman in the State of Virginia
has ever attended an all white school.

Itâ€™s unheard of.
Yeah! Unheard of.

And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

no other American had ever touched space.

And now, he will forever be remembered
as the US Navy man from New Hampshire.

The first to touch the stars.

And I, sir.

I plan on being an engineer at NASA.

But I canâ€™t do that without taking those
classes at that all-white high school.

And I canâ€™t change the color of my skin.

So, I have no choice.. but to be the first.

Which I canâ€™t do without you, sir.

Your Honor,

of all the cases youâ€™ll hear today,

which one will matter in a hundred years from now?

Which one will make you the â€œfirst?â€

Only the night classes.

<font color="#ffff80">Gus Grissom: Launch and Landing Projection</font>

<font color="#ffff80">By: Paul Stafford</font>

<font color="#ffff80">and Katherine Goble</font>

All right. Do you say, how it gonna be?
Give me more 5 minutes' sir.

Gus Grissom's are going late..

Iâ€™d like to get a jump on
John Glennâ€™s trajectory.

Do you have any idea what youâ€™re asking?

An orbital launch
with an Atlas Rocket is going to take time.

Is there a problem?

Mr. Harrison...

I was wondering....

Iâ€™ve been wondering my whole life.
So just... Spit it out.

Well, sir.

Iâ€™d like to get a jump on
John Glennâ€™s trajectory.

This isnâ€™t about plugging in numbers,
this is about inventing the math.

I think we talked about that, right?
It doesnâ€™t exist.

I can do it, sir.

Do you know any idea how exacting
these calculations have to be?

Itâ€™s like shooting a sawed-off shotgun
from a thousand feet,

and getting that one beebee through a hole
so tiny, you canâ€™t even see it.

Iâ€™m an excellent shot, sir.

How're Grissomâ€™s numbers. Paul?

They appear spot on.

Give Glennâ€™s orbit a go.

But you run it all through Stafford.
Understood?

Yes, sir.

Thank you.

Computers donâ€™t author reports.

Gus Grissom Recovery</font>

<i>Liberty Bell 7 capsule is stalking on water.</i>

<i>Gus Grissom is out of the capsule. Rescuers
are gonna bull him from the Ocean waves.</i>

<i>Unfortunately,</i>
Liberty Bell 7 capsule..

.. is lost.

<i>Mr. Harrison, Taxpayer money sank in</i>
the ocean along with your capsule.

What makes you think you can
bring John Glenn home safely?

Let me say first that discovery is never
for the sake of discovery, Gentlemen,

but for the sake of human survival.

It will always come with risk.

Whoever gets there first, will make the rules.
Thatâ€™s been true of every civilization. And so..

I think the bigger question for
this body to consider is..

who do you want calling the shots in space?

We have to know whatâ€™s out there, Senator.

We have to touch the stars. If
only to ensure our own survival.

And only a man can do that.

Weâ€™ll get John Glenn home safely
because we have to,

because he has to tell us what he saw.

The Redstone Rocket went straight up.

But the capsule..

.. didn't have enough speed to go
into orbit. So came back down.

Essentially itâ€™s a triangle..
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

The math was known.

It took Shepard,
it took Grissom.

But cannot take Glenn.

Now, The Atlas Rocket..

That can push us into orbit..
It goes up...

Delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

Earthâ€™s gravity keeps pulling it,

but itâ€™s going so fast that
it keeps missing the Earth.

That's how it stays in orbit.

Now, Getting it back down...

Thatâ€™s the math we donâ€™t know.

Yes, Katherine!

So, the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever,

because thereâ€™s nothing
to slow it down?

That's right. Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

by precisely the right amount

That is the task.

Yes, Katherine!

So, it means to move from an
elliptical orbit.. to a parabolic orbit?

Yes.
Thatâ€™s the Go/ No Go.

Now, this point is a pin head.

We bring him in too soon..
He burns up on reentry.

That's right. We bring him too late,
and heâ€™s pushed out of Earthâ€™s gravity.

Any changes in mass, weight, speed, time,

distance, friction... or a puff of wind..
would alter the Go/No Go.

And we start our calculatings.. over?

Yes.

So, we need to be able to
choose this re-entry point.

This Go/No Go.
This has to be exact.

Sam!

These are the latest Redstone numbers
and current capsule data.

Obviously, we know the launch spot

The Pentagon Briefing should illuminate
where the Navy needs the recovery zone.

When we work backwards from there.

And the rest is on us.
So, let's get to work.

Mr. Stafford.
<i>- What, Katherine?</i>

If I can attended these briefings, I
would be more useful to the project.

Pentagon briefing is a closed door.

Yes.
But we don't have the information,

or the changes.. we canâ€™t keep up.
I need the changes as they occur.

As you said, itâ€™s a pin head.
Katherine, thatâ€™s the job.

Then, when you asked for the assignment.
So just calculate with what you have.

Or weâ€™ll find someone who can.

OK.

Thatâ€™a girl.

And what the hell are you doing!?
<i>You canâ€™t be in here!</i>

 Who are you?

Iâ€™m with the West Computing Group.

Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

But, this is a very
delicate piece of equipment.

Iâ€™m sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

Bill, weâ€™ve got numbers.

What kind of numbers?

Look, Bill.

What's your name again?

Dorothy Vaughan.

Dorothy Vaughan?

<font color="#ffff80">Friendship 7 : Launch Projections</font>

Sir, Launch parameters
for Friendship 7.

Oh, Jesus! Itâ€™s all moot. Weâ€™re
altering the window on the capsule.

When did this happen?

6 minutes ago. The mass is changing.
Start over.

Sir.. If I could attend briefings..
I could stay current..

Katherine, weâ€™ve been through this.
Itâ€™s not possible.

Thereâ€™s no protocol for women attending.

Thereâ€™s no protocol for a man
circling the Earth either, sir.

OK. Thatâ€™s just
the way things are.

<font color="#ffff80">Friendship 7 : Launch Projections
 By: Paul Stafford</font>

<font color="#ffff80">and Katherine Goble.</font>

Colonel Glennâ€™s launch coordinates
accounting for the window change, sir.

Iâ€™ve told you this: Computers donâ€™t
author reports.  Fix it.

Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

But it is not the way this works.

Paul.
Whatâ€™s happening here?

Mr. Harrison,
Iâ€™d like to attend todayâ€™s briefing.

Whyâ€™s that?
Well, sir, the data changes so fast.

The capsule changes.  The weight and the
landing zones are all changing everyday.

I do my work, you attend these briefings.
I have to start all over.

Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks.

We donâ€™t have the math figured out yet.

Why canâ€™t she attend?
Because she doesnâ€™t have clearance, Al.

I can not do my work effectively
if I do not have all of the data,

and all of the information
as soon as itâ€™s available.

I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

Pentagon Briefings are not for civilians.
It requires the highest clearance.

I feel like Iâ€™m the best person
to present my calculations

Will you let this go, huh?
Well, I'm not!

Let her in? Sheâ€™s a woman.
Thereâ€™s no protocol for a woman attending.

Okay, I get that part, Paul.

But within these walls,
who... makes the rules?

You, sir.  Youâ€™re the boss.
You just have to act like one. Sir.

You keep quiet.

Thank you.

Good morning.

Good morning.

This is Katherine Goble with our
Trajectory and Launch Window Division.

Her work is pertinent to
todayâ€™s proceedings.

Come.
I'll get her a chair.

We have a confirmed
launch window..

Give her your chair.
Yes, sir.

We have a confirmed launch window for
friendship 7. Letâ€™s discuss a landing zone.

The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

20 miles square is what we can
service for retrieval.

Outside of that,
we risk the capsuleâ€™s recovery.

Weâ€™d like 3 possible recovery areas.

We canâ€™t cover half the damn ocean.

What I do respect
our capsuleâ€™s being altered daily.

Weâ€™re orbiting the Earth at...
whatâ€™s the speed now?

17,544 miles per hour.

At the time the rocket delivers the
capsule into low space orbit.

Thatâ€™s one hell of a speeding ticket.

OK.
So we have the vehicle's speed,

the launch window and for argumentâ€™s sake,
the landing zone is The Bahamas.

Should be enough to figure the Go/No Go?

Yeah! In theory, sir.
We need to be past theory at this point.

Weâ€™ll be able to calculate a
Go/No Go with that information.

When exactly is that gonna happen?

Katherine.

Have a go at it?

The Go point for re-entry

is 2,990 miles

from where we want Colonel Glenn to land.

If we assume thatâ€™s The Bahamas.

At 17,544 miles per hour..

 upon reentry..

370..

At a descent angle..

of 46.56 ..

degrees..
distance..

OK!
So, that puts the landing zone at...

25.0667Â° North,

77.3333Â° West.

Which is here!

Right here.
Give or take 20 square miles.

I like her numbers.

Thank you.

That of course is assuming the ..
capsule hits the reentry point exactly

How do we insure that?

Thatâ€™s the math we donâ€™t
have yet, gentlemen.

Weâ€™re working on it.

Katherine!

<i>Whatâ€™s it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?</i>

Weâ€™re just getting up to speed here,
Mr. Harrison.

I need more man power.

I mean Programmers.
Folks to feed the cards.

Then get them, for crying out loud.
right?

Youâ€™re the IBM man, right?
Yes, sir.

Pull them out of the sky if you
have to, but letâ€™s get ahead of

this thing. Or Iâ€™m not paying you.
I understand.

I got thoughts.
I got thoughts on it.

I'm not paying any of you!

Me?
Temporarily. Yes.

We need the IBM for Glennâ€™s launch.

The Lead Engineer says youâ€™re good
with the cards, programming and such.

What about the girls here?

Human computers canâ€™t calculate an
orbital flight in the time we have.

Theyâ€™ll stay put for now.
What about after â€œnow?â€

After the Glenn launch, NASAâ€™s
dissolvinâ€™ the Computing Groups.

Iâ€™m not accepting reassignment.

Unless, I bring my ladies with me.

Excuse me?

Weâ€™re going to need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

 I canâ€™t do it alone.
My girls are ready

 They can do the work.

Ladies!
weâ€™ve been reassigned.

Leave your calculators.
You wonâ€™t need them where weâ€™re going.

Welcome, ladies!

Do you know what your job is, Paul?

To find the genius among those geniuses.

 To pull us all up.

We all get to the peak together,
or we.. donâ€™t get there at all.

Yes. Well.
Good night, sir.

I donâ€™t know what time
Iâ€™m coming home.

The class ends at 9.

You get something to say?

Thought you might need these.

You can refill â€˜em with any weight
lead you want.

See? Just hit the tap like this.

A lead comes up.

You put the new lead in..

And.. New pencil!

You will make a fine engineer.

You think so?
Yes.

And nobody dare stand in the way of
Mary Jacksonâ€™s dreams. Myself included.

Donâ€™t make me mad again.
Yes, ma'am.

Then, donâ€™t make me late either.

Then don't be late, I'm waiting!

Hi, gentlemen.
Tonight we discuss Planckâ€“Einstein.

Where Planck relationships..

Yes?

Iâ€™m Mary Jackson.
Iâ€™m enrolled.

Well. The curriculum is not designed
for teaching... a woman.

Well, I imagine itâ€™s the same as
teaching a man.

I donâ€™t see a colored section.
Should I just take any seat?

Thank you.

OK.

 Planckâ€“Einstein...

The problem is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.

Thereâ€™s no mathematical formula for that.

As we can calculate launch, landing

but without this conversion, the capsule
stays in orbit, we canâ€™t bring it home.

Maybe weâ€™re thinking about this all wrong.

Howâ€™s that?

Maybe itâ€™s not new math at all.

It could be old math.

Something that looks at the problem
numerically, and not theoretically

Math is always dependable.
For you it is.

Eulerâ€™s Method.

Eulerâ€™s Method?
Yes.

Thatâ€™s ancient.
But it works!

It works numerically.

That's it!

Letâ€™s type it up.

Dorothy.

Mrs. Mitchell.

Youâ€™re working late today.

The same is always happening that way

Yes.
Seems to.

Thank you.

I hear the IBM is at full capacity.

You certainly have a knack for it

My father taught me a thing or
two about mechanics.

You know, I have a few girls in the East Group
that have an interest in knowinâ€™ more about it.

It is the future.
I may bring â€˜em by, if itâ€™s all the same to you.

Thatâ€™s not my decision. Ma'am.
That would be the supervisorâ€™s.

Yes.  Thatâ€™s true.

Well.
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

You know, Dorothy...

Despite what you may think..
I have nothinâ€™ against yaâ€™ll.

I know.
I know you probably believe that.

Goodnight, Katherine.

Good nigh!

Mamma.
Hey, baby!

Hi!
Hey!

Please don't tell me I miss
someone's birthday!

No, you didn't!
No, you didn't, mamma!

Madame...
Your seat.

Thank you!
Well, is it my birthday?

No, mamma.

You're all look so pretty!

Mamma!
What's going on?

Good evening, Katherine.

So, you are not gonna say anything?
It's not my place.

You, really?

Okay, Iâ€™m not going to do this all night...

Oh, mother of mercy.
Thatâ€™s for me?

Are you sad, Mamma?

No!     - Itâ€™s okay, Mamma.
Heâ€™s a good man.

I know.
I know.  I just.  I canâ€™t help it.

He hasnâ€™t even asked you yet.

I know, but he is..
You are, right?

If ya'll let me.

Go on. Sheâ€™s already crying.

This was my motherâ€™s ring.
It is beautiful

She and my father were married for..
For 52 years.

I figure itâ€™s about as lucky as a ring
as you can get.

The day I met you, I called my mother...

I said: "Mom!
I met the woman I want to marry."

Whatâ€™d she say?

She said: â€œShe must be something,
Jimmy.  Really something.â€

Then what'd you say?

I said: "No, She is more than Something,
She is Everything."

I planned on this being more romantic.
Iâ€™ll make that up to you real soon.

But I know marrying you..
includes me and the girls as well.

Amen to that.

I do.

I didnâ€™t ask you yet.
Hurry up!

No pain, please!
No, girls. No tears.

The Mercury Atlas Space vehicle,
which will putt John Glenn

the first American into Earth orbit,

has already undergone 5 unmanned
flight tests.

NASA has confirmed that the
IBM 790 data processing

system has been utilized to confirm all of the
mission's long and recovery system calculations.

The modification and equib-installation
are processing upon the schedule.

Them, Here!

You wanted to see me, sir?
Have a seat

Is there something wrong, Mr. Harrison?

No.  Thereâ€™s nothing wrong.

In fact our IBM is churning out numbers
in fractions of the time any human can

Present company included.

Thatâ€™s good then.

Maybe.

The thing is, the Cape is now insisting on
doing all the backups down there. On site.

I see.

So, we wonâ€™t be running backups here.

And truth be told, we canâ€™t keep up
with that IBM anyhow.

Long story short, we no longer need a..
computer in this department.

Progress is a double edged sword.

Letâ€™s have you report back
to the West Group for now.

Iâ€™ll see if we can find another assignment.
Thank you, sir.

Katherine, Iâ€™m..
I'm sorry about this

 Itâ€™s out of my hands, if you
can believe that.

I understand.

Katherine..
We heard you got engaged.

 Yes.
Thatâ€™s thoughtful of you.

Oh, Dear! Lovely.
Mr. Harrisonâ€™s idea really.

Although I suspect his wife did
the picking out.

I canâ€™t imagine he has an eye
on anything but numbers..

Now, you have a great wedding.
You did good work around here, Katherine.

I donâ€™t think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

It's so nervous.

This is beautiful than you were back then.
You think so?

Just a little older.

And a little fuller...
But you look good.

Here we go!
Again!

<font color="#ffff80">February 20, 1962
Jon Glenn's Launch</font>

That'a girl!

.. And Colonel John Glenn,will be
the first American to orbit the Earth.

As you can see, there are thousands of
people here to witness this history today..

Something is off here. These landing
coordinates donâ€™t match yesterdayâ€™s.

Let's see.
The IBM just ran them.

Then the IBM was wrong yesterday, right?

Goddamn! I think it's wrong today.

Paul, Am I right?
It appears so.

<font color="#ffff80">Cape Canaveral</font>

The IBM has been spot on up to this point, John.

but weâ€™ll run it again,
to see what it comes up with.

I'll be ass with you..
When I fly, I fly the machine,

<i>Right now, it seems like this machine
is flying me.</i>

Weâ€™re on the same page, John.
The guys are wrong in it.

Letâ€™s get the girl to check the numbers.

The girl?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

You mean Katherine?
Yes, sir.  The smart one.

If she says theyâ€™re good,
Iâ€™m ready to go.

All right. Weâ€™ll get into it.
<i>- Roger!</i>

Sam!
Go find find Katherine Goble.

She needs to verify Glennâ€™s Go/No Go
or weâ€™ll stay on the ground.

Yes, sir.

Iâ€™m looking for Katherine Goble?!

I'm Katherine Johnson now.
They need you to verify these coordinates.

All right.
Give them some space to work.

<i>A truly historic day for America..</i>

<i>The country has waited for several months,
Through many failed unmanned rocket tests</i>

<i>and then scheduled manned tasks,</i>

<i>which were canceled for various
mechanical or system complications.</i>

<i>All the final tests and checks are being conducted,</i>
John Glenn is ready to board the Friendship 7.

Anything from Langley?
Not yet.

<i>After years of waiting, and NASA delays,</i>

<i>John Glen is finally ready for that space..</i>

We are still going.
Yes, sir.

That's it.

What the devil you're doing?
Are you taking a break?

Can I see the time?

Sir.

Pad 14.

Katherine!

Come on!

Sir, weâ€™ve got Pad 14 on the box.

Get them in here.

<i>This is Langley.
We have the coordinates confirmed.</i>

<i>Standby, then.</i>

We can confirm the Go/No Go
point for re-entry is..

16.11984 degrees latitude
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

The launch window is a go.
The landing coordinates match.

That's very good news, Al.

It's a little hard to trust something
you canâ€™t look in the eyes.

Thatâ€™s right, Colonel.
Katherine did manage to calculate

a few decimal points further than that
hunk of metal.

Well, Iâ€™ll take every digit ya got.
Be sure to thank her for me.

Gentlemen! Let's launch this rocket.
Good luck, Friendship 7.

God speed, Langley.

<i>...Unit Cape Canaveral, and the countdown
has resumed. as Colonel John Glenn</i>

<i>is now aboard Friendship 7,
high above the Atlas rocket on Pan 14.</i>

<i>A height of over 93 feet ..</i>

<i>These pictures of Cape Canaveral flight
off. Mech-entry is now moving back.</i>

Here weâ€™re go for launch.

The Mercury Spacecraft is all its way out.

T-minus.
10 seconds, and counti'.

8.. 7.. 6.. 5..

<i>4.. 3.. 2..</i>

<i>1..  Zero.</i>
<i>Ignition.</i>

Itâ€™s getting bumpy along here.

<i>Roger that.</i>
You are in Max Q.

<i>Roger.
Keep countin'</i>

Twenty seconds to SECO.

<i>- The trajectory is still be "OK".</i>
Go for SECO.

Zero G. And I feeling fine.

<i>John Glenn reports everything looks good!</i>

Oh, that view is tremendous.

<i>Roger, that, Friendship 7.</i>

You are go for orbit.
Thanks you, Capcom!

All right. 10.5 hours to go.
If we make 7 round trips.

I do need a coffee.

<i>Well, as you focus on today,
here on the Eastern seaboard..</i>

<i>Colonel Glenn is just beginning
his third orbit.</i>

<i>Three coordinates of the way
across the African continent.</i>

<i>We see he is currently over Zanzibar, which
is the next tracking station coming up.</i>

<i>Thankfully the Friendship 7 capsule is..</i>

New assignment came down the pike.

Always changinâ€™ â€˜round here.
It's hard to keep up.

<font color="#ffff80">IBM Computing Lab.
Position: Supervisor</font>

Seems like theyâ€™re gonna need
a permanent team to feed that IBM

How big of a team?
30 to start.

Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

Youâ€™re quite welcome... Mrs. Vaughan.

<font color="#ff0000">Heat Shield</font>

We have a warning light!

<i>Capcom 7,</i>
I have a warning light.

Standby, 7.

Sir, we have a warning light!

What are you looking at, Paul?
The heat shield may have come loose.

7, will you confirm the landing
bag is in the OFF position?

Affirmative, Capcom.

We need to get him down, now
 He could burn up on re-entry.

Come on, babies!

Thereâ€™s a man in space. We donâ€™t want to
miss it, so we gonna home.

<i>Somethingâ€™s wrong with Glenn.</i>

Oh, my Goodness!
What's going on?

Let's go.
Ya'll follow me.

Weâ€™ve just learned, the Friendship 7..
is in danger of losing its heat shield.

Have you heard any banging noises?
<i>or anything of this type at higher rates?</i>

Thatâ€™s a negative, Capcom.

Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

Tell him not to jettison
the retro-package.

NASA is confirming this is some sort of
malfunction with the capsuleâ€™s heat shield,

and it may not stay in place.

If the heat shield is loose... The retro-
package straps might hold it in place.

Will that work?
It will work.

It will hold it until he reaches the
Go /No Go point. It will work!

He has to override the 05g.

Do it.

Friendship 7...

Weâ€™re recommending that the retro-package
NOT, I repeat, NOT be jettisoned.

<i>This means that you will have
to override the 05g switch.</i>

Roger!
Is this a reason for this? Over.

Standby, 7.

Not this time, 7.

Roger, that command.
Iâ€™ll have to make a manual 05g entry,

and bring the scope in.
Over.

He knows.

<i>Without a heat shield,
thereâ€™s no way that Colonel Glenn</i>

<i>can get back through
the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.</i>

<i>The heat is simply too overpowering.. and
might function the automatic control system...</i>

You're going to use
fly-by-wire for reentry.

Youâ€™ll need to maintain a zero angle.
Over. Over?

Roger.  I'm on fly-by-wire,
back-it up with manual.  Over.

Keep talking to him.

Roger. The weather in the recovery area:
3 foot waves, 10 miles visibility.

Can't get'm.
Are you are getting out now?

Heâ€™s crossing the
communication black-out zone.

Thereâ€™s a real fireball outside,
and it's getting too hot here!

Friendship 7.
Do you copy?  Over.

Again.

Friendship 7.
Do you copy?  Over.

Friendship 7. Do you copy?  Over.

Loud and clear, Capcom.

Roger that.
How are you doing?

My condition is good.
But that was a real fireball, boy

<i>Roger that.
Letâ€™s get you all the way home.</i>

<i>Roger that.</i>
Hereâ€™s hoping these landing coords still hold.

Approaching 16.11984.

Roger that!
Approaching -165.2356.  In 3, 2, 1.

Engaging chutes.

Beautiful chutes.
How do I look, Capcom?

<i>Your Go/No Go is good.</i>
Landing coordinates are spot on, 7.

Roger that, Capcom.

I've Always wanted to swim in
the Bahamas. Over.

John Glenn has splashed-down,
and is being recovered.

<i>John Glenn has splashed-down safely.
and is being recovered by US Navy.</i>

Katherine!

Nice work.
You too, Mr. Harrison.

So..

You think we will get to the moon?

We're already there, sir.
