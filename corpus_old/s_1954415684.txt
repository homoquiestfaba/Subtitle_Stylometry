I was thinking about going to that one house
Did you hear what happened to wayne?

Ya I heard about that

Well do you wanna go there and check it out man?
It's gonna be pretty cool

I'm not really into that kind of stuff

C'mon man just for tonight

I don't think I'm really up for that right now

This one last time and I won't ever drag
you out to one of these things again

Trust me there's nothing there!
There's nothting there for us to see

One of our friends seen something out there,
We have a good chance of seeing something

OK!
We'll go there but 5 minutes we see nothing there were gone

Half an hour!
At least

Half an hour.. Tops?

Tops!
Alright

Sounds good then,
Ok then see ya later man

See ya later!

Might as well turn this on while I wait for him

Fuck!
He said he was gonna be here already

Finally!
Only took him a half an hour to get here

What the hell took you so long?

I was making my way

I just got done work

Well...

I'm bringing this camera along with us,
As you can see

Nice camera!
where did you get that?

I got it last week

HD Camera?

Yup
Top of the line!

For now till next week probably

You gonna upgrade already?

No!

I just mean that's when new cameras are gonna 
come out probably you know how that world works

Ya technology..

it's good for a day

You ready for this?

Ready to waste my time..

Well you can call it what you want
But who knows you might get surprised

It's pretty creepy out there I've seen a picture of it

Oh Ya?

Well I just kinda wanted to do something

I was kinda getting bored

Iv'e been doing nothing but work
and staying home

are you gonna be documenting me too?

Yeah!
you got a problem with that?

I Might!!

This is a long fucking ride.. Man

I hope it's down this road up here

Where did wayne's friend say it was located?

He said it was down here somewhere

On one of these side roads
I think road started with an 'M'

Oh! Mersea road?

Ya that was it!

Mersea road 23 right?

Ya oh ya
Ok

I think I know where that is just
gotta take a left right up here

Glad we're not going at night man,
because I'd be scared shitless

Well it's almost night, In about one more hour

Half an hour we're gonna be outta there hopefully

That's what I promised

It's gotta be somewhere around here

Ugh it's muddy out here!

Where you going?

going to higher ground?

Let me see that camera

Shit!
It's all zoomed in..

Dude!
I think we are in the wrong spot right now

Where did you say this house was?

WHAT?

Where did you say this house was?

I don't know its over here somewhere

We are definitely in the wrong spot

So you wanted to document this,
Go ahead and document it

**cough**

I don't know where this thing is?

He said it was down this road.

We've been driving all over

I don't even see any houses down this road
Maybe..

I'm on Mersea road
Wait a second

Maybe it's down this road

Is it that one right there man?

I think that's it

It looks pretty small though,
You sure that's a house?

Looks all beat up

Looks pretty dilapidated

I have no clue,
But I think that's it!

That's where wayne seen it right?

What's the number again 19.. 1909?

He didn't really tell me the number..
Something like that

I don't know let's just go check it out

I'm having second thought about this

Why you getting scared now?

I'm not scared I just don't wanna trespasse
on places where i'm not supposed to be

He said no one lived there

So what are we gonna do?
Just go in and check?

Real quick or something

Well I don't know
we'll go look and see what we can see

I don't know if i wanna go in

Looks like we could fall through
the floor if anything

Wow look at the thing man it doesn't look too safe

What's that number?

Its 190....

It's 1906 it is man that's the house
Ya that's what it was

It doesn't look as scary as I thought it would be,
But it definitely looks like something pretty bad happened here

So we're just gonna go take a look inside
and then we'll leave right?

Will you be happy with that?

I guess

Ok let's do this

This is definitely it!

We gotta go check this out

How do we get down here?

There's not even a path way

Alright. Let's try not to fall with this camera

Holy shit!

We should definitely not be doing this right now

Well we're just gonna take a peek 
and then we'll leave if you want

Holy fuck! is this a ditch?

Are you sure this is abandoned man?

It looks like it the door is..
What was that?

Ok I think it was just the stairs creaking

I think i'm just scaring myself right now

Dude man?Â¨

of the trip I thought

It fellt weird like something just like..

Like something just pick me up..

What?

It didn't' feel like I tripped or fell

It felt like someone you know spread me, 
like just knocked me right over

That's weird

It was

It wasn't even windy or anything

It was windy but it wasn't like you know..

Well it wasn't a tornado out there

Ya obviously!

I got a doctor's consent saying I should
be taking off 3 days to rest my hand

Nice little vacation

Ever since we've been to that house man

I don't know what it is but...

I just can't stop thinking about it

I could have sworn that we've seen something there

I don't know maybe it was just a raccoon or something.
But..

I sure felt something

I know I don't even know what happened to you

That was the weirdest thing i've ever seen in my life

I don't even know how you can sleep

Because I'd be up all night

Oh wow!

Way to go, 
Way to fuckin cast

That was a nice cast man

Thanks i've been working on that actually

You think there's any fish in this pond man we come 
here almost every weekend and never catch nothing

I have hope one day we'll catch something

Dam!
I lost my bait

Really?
Ya

Wow

All day and nothing

Not even one nibble

I know

I thought I had a couple nibbles

They definitely stole a couple of my worms

What was that??
