Ripped from DVD for http://www.opensubtitles.org by boso

So this is where I was born--

Riverview MedicaI Center,

right here in beautifuI downtown

Red Bank, New Jersey,
on the Jersey shore,

mere miIes from where I wouId grow up
in HighIands, New Jersey.

And then Iater on,
I'd come to Iive here

in my somewhat aduIt years.

View Askew offices are here.

Jay and SiIent Bob's Secret Stash
comic book store is here.

So I haven't gotten reaIIy far
from the hospitaI

where I was vaginaIIy
pooped into the worId.

The next big time I came back here

was aImost 29 years after I was born,

when I had my kid.

I made sure we were in Los AngeIes

when my wife was pregnant,

and I made sure that we
got on a pIane, got home

so I couId have her right here

at the same hospitaI I was born.

She couId be born a Jersey girI.

And I went through aII that troubIe

just so I couId use her
to do an intro for this DVD.

Isn't that shameIess?

I mean, I Iiked fucking my wife, too, but,

chiefIy, it was, Iike,
''We need somebody to be abIe

to kick off the Q and A.''

And she said, ''AII right.''

She gave me the courtesy roIIover,

puIIed up a cheek,
and a IittIe back insertion,

and it was aII good.

And it Ied to this.

HeIIo, New Jersey!


I'm Jennifer SchwaIbach.

And I'm HarIey Quinn Smith.

And we are here
to weIcome you and thank you

for coming from aII over the worId

to ceIebrate the 37th birthday

of a very beIoved husband and father

and, of course, fiImmaker.

And now, without further ado--

Introducing Kevin Smith!

So that's who I fuck.


And that's what happens when I fuck.

When I was a kid,

we'd drive past this theater aII the time,

and I'd be, Iike, ''Is he
reIated to Count DracuIa?''

I want to pIay you jazz.

That is, Iike, a ten-year-oId's joke.

StiII fucking works, man.

AII the jokes from my chiIdhood
stiII kind of fucking work.

The eye cup jokes stiII works.

One of my favorite jokes--
If you're from the area--

If you're from out of here,
you might not know CarveI--

CarveI Ice Cream.

Where, basicaIIy, they serve
soft-serve aII the time,

and they show you,
on the commerciaI,

the dude where they fu--
[audience member] Cookie!

Cookie Puss and Fudgie the WhaIe, yes.

Cookie Puss, which became
the unfortunate misnomer

of many girIs in high schooI.

AIways attached to
the fucking, Iike, you know,

suburban myth of ''I know this chick,

and she Iet a dog eat
a cookie out of her pussy.

A cookie.

She put a fucking chocoIate chip cookie
in her pussy, and the dog ate it.

We caII her Cookie Puss.''

And you beIieve that shit
'cause you wanna beIieve it.

You're Iike, ''What girI is this?

Because if she's so fucking desperate

she'II Iet a dog eat a fucking cookie
out of her pussy,

I got a shot, you know?''

But if you watch the commerciaIs for CarveI,

they aIways show
the soft-serve ice cream--

the hand with the cone and shit.

They puII the fucking crank,
and the ice cream twirIs out and shit.

So when we were kids,

the big joke was ''What's this?''

That's Tom CarveI taking a shit.

And my materiaI hasn't gotten
much better since then.

Just variations on that theme.

WeII, this is a big show for me
because it's hometown.

I was born 37 years ago

from today,

a few bIocks away at Riverview HospitaI.

[cheering, appIause]

That's kind of cooI, man.
Like, 37 years Iater,

I'm kind of up here sweating Iike a pig.

But it's wiId.

I mean, I don't know.

I can't teII you where I was
every other birthday in my Iife,

but I can teII you now
where I was on my 37th birthday.

I didn't get very far.

Just a few bIocks down.

I was born on August 2, 1970.

And it wasn't my birthday.

I mean, it was technicaIIy.

But before it was my birthday,
it was my brother's birthday.

My brother and I are born on the same day,

four years apart.

He was born in 1966. I was born in 1970.

My sister was born August 10, 1965,

which, if you do the math,

my parents Ioved to fuck
during eIection periods.


I just picture my oId man being Iike,

''We did our civic duty.
Now do your wifeIy duty.''

And my mother being, Iike, ''Jesus, Don.

''Just can't we fucking ever vote

without me having to do
shit with your dick?''

And if my father was anything Iike me,

I'm sure he was just, Iike,
''You don't have to do anything.

I'II just jerk off and you watch. Just--

Just Iook at it. Just Iook at my dick.''

The most shamefuI part
of my existence is that--

the fucking pIea for, Iike, just--

''You don't even have to touch it.
Just watch me jerk off.''

But I wouIdn't have a dick

without one key person in the audience.

I want to acknowIedge her,
'cause I wouId not be here tonight

if it weren't for my mom.

So, Mom, where are you?

[cheering, appIause]

But I guess for a whiIe,

my name wasn't gonna be my name.

My mom aIways toId me
that the day I was born,

her and my father were gonna
name me Brian David.

[Man] Yeah, Brian!
Yes.

After you, I'm sure. And--


And I guess somebody who had a kid
on the same day as my mom--

Is this right? Mom, where are you?

A friend of yours had a kid
aIso and named it Brian David.

What kind of fucking friend
is that? Like--

Are you even friends
with those peopIe anymore?

Are you reaIIy?

'Cause after that, I'd be, Iike, ''Fuck you!

That was ours!''

So she Iooked-- What was it?

Daddy Iiked the name Kevin Patrick.

Did Dad Iike
the name Kevin Patrick?

Not a singIe Kevin
in our famiIy, nor a Patrick.

My grandmother used to
teII me that aII the time.

She's, Iike, ''I don't know
where they got that name.''

Aren't any Kevins in the famiIy.

'Cause a Iot
of our famiIy members--

My sister Virginia is named
after my Aunt Virginia.

My brother DonaId named after--
His dad.

His father. Thank you.

Random name. And aIso,
since we were CathoIic,

it was tradition to pick a name
of a saint and shit Iike that.

So I went with-- I got named Kevin Patrick.

And Patrick is easy. Saint Patrick.

'Cause of St. Patrick's CathedraI,

and everybody knows that.

And St. Patrick,
the patron saint of IreIand and shit.

Drove the snakes out of IreIand.

Kevin-- Saint Kevin--

Not a Iot known about him.

And for a whiIe, when I
was in CathoIic schooI,

I was just, Iike,
''I'm named after St. Kevin.''

And even these fucking nuns
wouId be, Iike, ''Who's that?''

I was, Iike, ''It's true.
There is a St. Kevin.''

They're, Iike, ''Yeah, right, man.

I'm sure there's a Pope Smith, too.''

So after 37 years,

I decided to fucking Iook up some info

and see who St. Kevin was,

and--

and it's pretty fucking retarded.

There are-- You know,

when you hear of patron saints--

If you're not CathoIic,
you don't know about them.

If you're Jewish, you're just,
Iike, ''Who's Jesus?'' Um--

You know,

the saints are given patron--
They're given--

Saints are considered patrons
of certain things.

Like, you know, St. Lawrence
is the patron saint of comedy,

'cause he was a martyr.

Most of the saints were martyred
because they beIieved in Jesus.

AII you have to do is
get kiIIed beIieving in Jesus.

One day, they canonize you.

You have to have
a few miracIes to your name,

but it heIps if you died
in the name of Jesus.

Which means you couId be fucking,

die of a heart attack--

As Iong as you're, Iike, ''Jesus''--

St. Nuts-Deep, you know.

Patron saint of dying
in the midst of fucking.

So there are a bunch of them.
You know, Iike,

St. Christopher is the patron saint
of the traveIer.

So when peopIe drive around--
they're CathoIic--

sometimes you'II see
St. Christopher medaIs

on their dash and shit.

My mom used to wear one around her neck
whenever we traveIed.

Patron saint of traveIing.

It's a picture of a dude
hoIding a baby Jesus on his shouIder,

crossing a stream,

where you're, Iike, ''That's aII it took?''

It's not Iike, you know,
he's fighting fucking Iions

and swinging Iike Indiana Jones and shit.

It was a stream this thick,
and he's, Iike--

''I'm gonna be famous for that one day.''

St. Kevin, though--

''patron saint of crows.''

''Noted as the man

who did not aIways Iike
the company of men.''

Which, to me, says

the patron saint of
homophobes, you know? Just--

''I don't Iike to be around dudes.

They got dicks.''

''But was at home with the animaIs

as some of the Iegends
surrounding him show.''

So the patron saint
of homophobia and bestiaIity.

Here's some of the stories
they teII about St. Kevin.

''During a drought, Kevin fed his monks

with saImon brought to him by an otter.''

So, Iike, whenever peopIe write,
Iike, ''Dude, don't you think

fucking ScientoIogy is weird
and stupid and crazy?''

I just whip this out and--

I'm, Iike, ''This is what
some CathoIics beIieve.''

''When one of the monks
considered making gIoves

out of the otter's peIt,
it Ieft and never returned.''

Who fucking remembered that story?

Like, who wrote that story down, man?

Somebody was just, Iike, ''One time,

''he gave us a bunch of saImon
that the otters brought him,

''and then one of us wanted
to make it into gIoves,

and then the otter ran away.''

It just sounds Iike the patron saint

of, Iike, acid fIashback stories.

''Once, during Lent,

whiIe he heId his arms
outstretched in prayer''--

Like that, presumabIy.

''A bIackbird Iaid an egg in Kevin's hand.''

I couIdn't make this up.

Uh--

''He remained in that position

untiI the baby bird hatched.''

CouId you imagine-- AII right.
Like, if this happens--

You put out your hand
and a bird Iands in it,

Iike, that's fucking weird.

The bird Iays an egg in your hand?

Which, at first,
you're, Iike, ''Oh, my God.

The bird's shitting in my hand.''

But if you have
enough presence of mind

to be Iike, ''Oh, it's an egg.''

You know. And then the bird
presumabIy fIies away.

And then you stand there

for the entire gestation period,

waiting for that
fucking egg to hatch.

I mean, I don't know much

about fucking science
and shit and bioIogy,

don't mother birds Iay eggs

and sit on them for a Iong time?

This dude just had the power

to have an egg drop in his hand
and be, Iike, boop.

''Life.''

''A young man with severe epiIepsy

received a vision that he wouId
be cured by eating an appIe.

There were, however,
no appIe trees about.

Kevin, seeing the Iad's need,

''ordered a wiIIow to produce appIes.

Twenty yeIIow appIes
appeared on the tree.''

That's not true. That--

I wasn't there.
This aII took pIace in, Iike, 600 AD.

I cannot fucking imagine
that that happened and shit.

Kevin just had
the worId's best pubIicist.

''St. Kevin's dick was 12 inches Iong.''

''A boar was being chased
by a group of hunters with their dogs.

''It ran to where Kevin sat,
praying under a tree,

''and cowered beside him
for protection.

''When the dogs saw the saint in prayer,

''they just Iaid on their stomachs

''and wouId not approach the boar.

''When the hunters decided
they wouId ignore the man

''and kiII the boar anyway,

''a fIock of birds settIed in the tree

''above the praying saint.

''The hunters took this as a sign

and Ieft man and beast aIone.''

What fucking hunter doesn't
see a tree fuII of birds

and isn't Iike, ''Shit''?

[imitates gunfire]

Fish in a barreI.

That's my fucking namesake--
St. Kevin.

So fucking queer.

But not in that, Iike,
awesome cocksucking way.

Just queer, meaning odd. It's strange.

So who wants to start, man?

You ready to start? Ready to rock it?

[audience members whooping]

Give it up for the first guy.

[cheering, appIause]

Firstie, don't fuck it up!

He's got a point, dude.
Don't fuck it up.

You set the tone for the
whoIe evening and shit.

I just wanna say Happy Birthday, first off.

WeII, now you fucked up aIready.

Thank you very much.
Let's just put a moratorium on that.

Let's aII agree that it's my birthday.

Let's stop saying it.

Just to keep--
Thank you for doing it.

You're the first.
You'II be the onIy and shit.

Like my Iove.

So, no ''Happy Birthdays'' and shit.

'Cause fuck it.
It gets boring after a whiIe.

Everyone's, Iike, ''I just
wanna say Happy Birthday.''

It's, Iike, ''WeII, I just want you
to ask a fucking question.''

But thank you very much for that.
Rock your question, sir.

Okay, ever since you voiced
a character in Doogal,

have you ever thought
of writing a chiIdren's movie?

Something more for--

that HarIey couId watch
on a reguIar basis?

Ever since I-- Wait. What did I do?

Doogal.

Doogal. Oh, Doogal.

That's right. I did a voice
in Doogal and shit Iike that.

Which was strange,
'cause it was reaI, Iike, you know--

Harvey Weinstein
caIIed me up and said,

''Do you wanna do a voice
in a cartoon movie?''

I said, ''God, yeah. I got a kid.''

He's Iike, ''That's why I asked.''

He's, Iike, ''You'II score huge
Brownie points with your kid.''

I was, Iike, ''Yeah, right on.
What do I pIay?''

He's, Iike, ''A farting moose.''

I was Iike, ''So, typecasting?''
He was Iike, ''Pretty much.''

Have I ever thought about
making a kids' movie?

No. Even though I got a kid,
I don't reaIIy think about it.

I just assume she'II start watching my movies
sooner or Iater.

We don't keep her from the movies

'cause the Ianguage
and shit Iike that.

She wouId just be totaIIy
bored by those movies.

I've tried a few times. 'Cause I'm Iike,

there's a joke or two in here
that she might enjoy.

And I'II put it on. I Iet her watch
the Clerks cartoon.

Even that, she was just, Iike,
''They just keep taIking.''

I was, Iike, ''Yeah, but there's an awesome
Schindler's List joke here, you know?''

So I don't know.

I didn't reaIIy think about
buiIding a career around

making fIicks for my kids.

I mean, Iike, Robert Rodriguez did that,

and now he's fucking
so insaneIy weaIthy.

So I guess I shouId've
given it some thought.

But I just don't have
those kind of fIicks in me.

I've been threatening for years
to write a chiIdren's book,

'cause I know I got
a chiIdren's book in me,

and I've been saying it
since the kid was born.

My wife was Iike, ''Get around to it

''so we can read her the book.

WouIdn't it be sweet
if you couId read her your own book?''

I said, ''Yeah, yeah, yeah.''

Now the kid reads herseIf and shit.

She's Iike, ''Now she can
read the book herseIf,

so get around to writing it.''

I was Iike, ''Yeah, yeah. TotaIIy. TotaIIy.''

I'm gonna wait untiI she's
in coIIege and shit,

and just rock her with the kids' book.

Be Iike, ''Check it out.''

She's, Iike, ''The Woof on the Roof.

I'm gonna go have some fucking sex
with my roommate, so''--

Thanks, SiIent Bob, you know.

But in terms of doing a kids' movie,

I never reaIIy thought about it.

I don't think I have the chops
for that kind of thing.

Don't think, you know,

that I'm the guy that you shouId
put in charge of a kids' movie.

'Cause there was, Iike, at one point,
after Clerks got soId,

when we were going around
touring with studios.

They were, Iike, ''What do you wanna do
after your movie gets picked up?

''Sundance Studios wanna meet
with you. Do you have an idea?

What do you wanna do?'' Shit Iike that.

We went into Fox, I think it was,

and they were pitching us
movies to direct,

which I thought was weird,

'cause I'm, Iike, ''Did you
see the first movie?

You don't wanna give me a movie.

You wanna Iet me
make something of mine

that I won't fuck up too badIy.''

And the one they gave us
was one of the ones they pitched us.

Which, ironicaIIy, there's a movie
coming out caIIed Hot Rod.

But it wasn't that Hot Rod.

It was a movie caIIed Hot Rod
with MichaeI Jackson as the star,

in which MichaeI Jackson
hung around with a IittIe kid.

It's a true story. This is circa 1994,
so it was stiII kind of okay.

QuestionabIe.

PeopIe'd be Iike, ''Wow,
he hangs out with kids a Iot.''

But not Iike, ''Get your kids
away from him,'' you know.

He hangs out with a kid,
and he can morph into a car,

and then the kid wouId open
the car and get inside.

And back in 1994, I was Iike,
''I don't wanna do that.''

Now I wouId Iove to do that movie.

'Cause there's a fucking insaneIy good movie
to make about MichaeI Jackson

with IittIe boys entering him and shit.

And vice versa. Uh--

[audience groans]

Don't fuck-- Don't boo me.

I didn't fuck a kid.

[Iaughter, scattered appIause]

AIthough neither did he,
I guess, aIIegedIy.

But where there's smoke, there's fire.

And where there's a hand
on some kid's ass,

there's MichaeI Jackson.

But my kid has actuaIIy been,
Iike, bugging me

to do stories about our dogs,

'cause that's one of the things
that we share a common interest in.

'Cause she's 8 and shit,

and she Ioves me, and I Iove her,

but we're on two different waveIengths.

Don't reaIIy reIate to one another

Iike the way I reIate
to my friends and shit.

I can't be sitting there taIking to her
about, Iike, ''I got bIown Iast night.''

You know.

''It was aII right,

but not one of the best,'' you know.

''What's 'bIown'?''

''Ask Mom.''

''And don't ever do it.''

But the dogs are something

that we share a common interest in.

We got this IittIe dachshund
named Shecky.

Shecky.

And she is fascinated by Shecky.

She just wants me to make a movie
about the IittIe dachshund,

because she thinks
the dog is reaIIy wacky

and shit Iike that.

She's Iike, ''You can make a whoIe movie
just about Shecky.''

I'm, Iike, ''I don't know if anybody

''but you and I wouId
appreciate that movie.

''Even your mother
wouId hate that movie

'cause she hates Shecky.''

Because I wasn't supposed
to get the dog.

The dog was kind of a joke.

The dog grew out of a joke, man.

We were driving around--
me and Jen-- one day,

and somebody had a dog
hanging out the window.

You know, you drive around,
you see peopIe with dogs

Iike this out the window.

It was a IittIe dog-- wasn't a dachshund--

and it Iooked Iike it was beIted in--

'Cause you can buy
a seat beIt for a dog now.

So this dog wasn't
just a head out the window.

This dog was, Iike,
two paws on the windowsiII,

one Ieg aImost over the window.

This dude was making a turn and shit,

and the dog was, Iike,
hanging out the window.

We both saw it at the same time.

I said, ''Did you fucking see that?

''How fucked up is that?

''That dog, Iike, Iooks Iike
he's faIIing out of the car.

The dog's Iike''--

And nothing I say
makes my wife Iaugh-- very IittIe--

so when she Iaughs,
I tend to fucking, Iike,

run it into the ground and shit.

Kind of Iike the way I run my career.

So she Iaughed at it and shit,

and so it just grew from there.

She was Iike, ''That's so funny.

Why does he make that noise?''

I didn't wanna teII her that's the noise

that fucking R2-D2 makes
when he's shot.

So I just took credit for it, you know.

I was Iike, ''I wrote that.''

And that was the dog--

She was just Iike, ''That's so funny.

I was Iike, ''Can you just see fucking Shecky
hanging out the window?''

And she fucking thought that was briIIiant.

She was Iike,
''Why is the dog named Shecky?

I've never heard that before.''

I was Iike, ''That's a reaI name.
You never heard Shecky?''

She's Iike, ''No.''
She thought it was fucking hystericaI.

So every time I want to make her Iaugh,
I'd bring up a Shecky story.

Then I was Iike, ''We shouId
just fucking get a Shecky.''

'Cause we got dogs, right?
We got two yeIIow Iabs.

One is named MuIder.
One's named ScuIIy.

A IittIe gay, but whatever.

And then we went and got a chocoIate Iab
one day named Louie.

And so we had three dogs aIready--
three Iabs.

They're aII kind of--

Not huge dogs, but big dogs.
NormaI-sized dogs.

The idea of having a hot dog--
a wiener dog--

Which, you know-- Look, I Iove dogs.

And that kind of Iooks Iike Shecky.

Except she's not bIue.

But I aIways wanted a IittIe dog.

Not so I can carry it around
Iike Paris HiIton and shit,

but just to have, Iike a IittIe dog,

'cause I thought, Iike--

There was a book we read to HarIey
caIIed Big Dog and Little Dog.

It's about a very Iarge dog
that hangs out with a very IittIe dog.

Go figure.

And there was one version of the book

caIIed Big Dog and Little Dog
Wearing Sweaters.

That was the name
of the whoIe fucking book.

I used to Iove reading the kid that book,

'cause what a great titIe
that was and shit.

That's the titIe on the very first page.

Big Dog and Little Dog
are Wearing Sweaters.

Like that's their whoIe day--
pimpin' around in sweaters.

So I was, Iike,
''We shouId get a IittIe dog,

'cause then we'II finaIIy have
Big Dog and LittIe Dog and shit.

And the wife just
wouIdn't hear about it.

I was, Iike, ''Come on, man.
Like, a dog named Shecky.

A IittIe dachshund named Shecky.
A wiener dog named Shecky.

How awesome is that?'' She's Iike,

''Maybe if one of
these other dogs die, sure.

''But right now, we got three dogs.

''You don't need a fucking fourth dog,

''especiaIIy if it's just
for a punch Iine to a joke

that wasn't that funny to begin with.''

I was Iike, ''You Iaughed.''

So one day, the wife
was going out of town.

A friend of hers was having
a baby shower and shit,

and she was Ieaving me with the kid.

And I was testing the waters and shit.

I was, Iike, ''When you're gone,

we're gonna go out and get a Shecky.''

She was, Iike,
''Don't fucking do it, Kevin!

''I'm serious. I do not wanna
come home to a fucking dog.

Don't buy another dog.''

I was Iike, ''I wouIdn't fucking do that.

I'm just busting
your nonexistent fucking baIIs.''

So brought her to the airport--
me and the kid in the car.

Dropped her off on the curb,

and one hour Iike, ''Love you. Bye.''

Door cIosed. I was Iike,
''Let's go get Shecky.''

That's what the kid is awesome for.

The kid is just an awesome
IittIe fucking deviI on your shouIder

that's super-supportive
of aII your worst instincts.

Where you're just Iike,
''Let's get fucking ice cream.''

She's Iike, ''Yeah!''

So I was Iike, ''Let's go get Shecky.''

She's Iike, ''I'm right
behind you, Pop.'' You know.

So we hightaiI it to the fucking maII.

You'd imagine I wouId've Iearned,

because I bought a maII dog before.

MaII dogs just not great dogs and shit.

First dog we got was ScuIIy.

We got her 'cause Jen got pregnant.

We were taIking.

I was Iike, ''I don't know
if I'd be a good father.

I've never reaIIy taken care
of anything in my Iife.''

She was Iike, ''Me, neither.''

I was Iike, ''Maybe we shouId get a dog
to see-- you know,

''to train as parents and shit.

You couId, Iike,
breastfeed and whatnot.''

I can take pictures,
put it up on the Web.

Lucrative bestiaIity market.

So we decided to go out and get a dog.

She's Iike, ''We gotta get yeIIow Iabs,
'cause I grew up with a yeIIow Iab.

YeIIow Iabs are great around chiIdren.

That's the kind of dog we gotta get.''

I was so excited, 'cause I've never
had a dog in my Iife.

Had cats.

One day, a cat foIIowed me
home and shit Iike that,

which was awesome.

We were never aIIowed to have pets.
I was about 13.

This cat just hung out on
the front steps of our house.

It was kind of grown-up and shit.

So I kept feeding it.

FinaIIy, I said to my parents,

''Can't we just Iet
this cat in the house?''

They were Iike, ''Maybe
it's time he had a pet.

''He's fucking 13,

and he's interested in pussy,
so this counts.''

So we got that cat.

That Ied to another cat.
That Ied to another cat.

We had five cats in the house.

So we went from having no pets--

just a barren wasteIand of pets--

to having five cats in the house.

We became ''the cat house'' in town.

Cats are great, but they're just not--

They have no use for you
untiI you feed them.

Other than that, they're just,
Iike, very independent.

They're not Iike a dog

who'II come up and sIobber
aII over your face.

Man's best friend.

Cats are just, Iike,
man's compIacent roommate.

So--

It went far with the cats,
too, for some reason.

Like, my father, in his retired years,
used to work at the post office.

He'd finaIIy retired,

and then he had nothing
to do during the day.

One of the things he used to do,

and hated doing but did it reIigiousIy--

There were cats outside the house

'cause we had cats inside,

so other neighborhood cats
wouId hang out near our house.

They didn't seem
to be owned by anybody,

and I started feeding them.

So whatever Ieftovers we had--
put out for the cats.

And then it graduaIIy grew
into an army of 27 cats.

No Iie, dude. Like, you hear
about the famiIies--

Like, ''That's a house that has 27 cats.''

That was our fucking house.

PeopIe are, Iike,
''That house smeIIs Iike cat urine.''

My house.

My oId man, Iike, every day
at 3:00 and shit Iike that,

wouId kind of get this dishwashing bucket.

Big pIastic dishwashing bucket.
Tupperware-type thing.

A trough, Iike, this big.
FiII it fuII of, Iike,

fucking any kind of cheap dog food

we'd get at the food store,

staIe bread, water,
any Ieftover meats and shit.

Grind it up with his fucking hands,

bitching about it the whoIe time.

''These fucking cats.

I hate this shit, Grace. I hate these cats.''

And nobody ever made him do it.

It wasn't Iike my mother was Iike,
''You'II feed those cats,

or no anaI for you.''

It was nothing Iike that.

He just fucking did it. That was his thing.

But he hated doing it.
But he did it every day.

I wouId aIways have to
open the door for him.

He's Iike, ''Go get the fucking door.
Open the door.''

And he'd fucking wrestIe
with this big bucket fuII of cat shit,

bring it outside, put it downstairs.

And, Iike, out of nowhere,
Iike fucking ninjas,

27 cats just appeared.

Went around the trough just fucking eatin'.

It was fucking insane, dude, to watch.

And he wouId bitch about it
the whoIe way. ''Fucking cats.

''One day, something's gonna happen.
They'II aII be gone.

I can't fucking wait.''
Never occurred to him--

Just stop feeding them, dude.
They're onIy hanging out

'cause they know at 3:00 every day,

they're gonna get a meaI.

Just stop feeding the fucking cats.

But I think he secretIy Ioved it.

Then we had a big fIood

right when we were supposed
to start shooting Clerks.

I think we were supposed
to start shooting Clerks

in December of '92.

'91? '92? '92.

There was a big nor'easter storm
we had on the East Coast.

Our town, HighIands,
was kind of beIow sea IeveI to begin with.

The town fIooded.
We had tons of water in our house.

And kiIIed aII the fucking cats.

It was kind of sad,
but it was aIso kind of fucking funny.

'Cause they had nowhere to go.

They aII Iived in our yard
and other peopIe's yards.

After the fIoodwater subsided--

'Cause it was up to here
in my house-- the water.

We had a ranch house--

When you hear ranch house,

you're Iike, ''Wow, you had horses?'' No.

''Did you have a Iot of property?'' Not at aII.

A ranch house is just
a one-fIoor house.

So we had water up to here
in our house and whatnot.

So I was sIoshing around
in the house in fucking water.

So anybody outside on four Iegs
was just, Iike-- You know.

Trying to fucking keep their head
above water and shit.

When the water subsided,

we wouId be finding cats
for the next month.

We'd find cats-- It's a true story.

It's sad but kind of funny.

Uh, neighbors wouId be Iike,

''We found five of your cats under our house.''

We'd be Iike, ''WeII, those weren't
technicaIIy our cats.

They were just cats outside
that we fed a Iot.''

The neighbor's Iike, ''Yeah,
that makes them your cats.

''CouId you fucking get a Hefty bag
and get them out of there, pIease?''

There was one cat across the street--

Like, was cIimbing onto a fence--

Not Iike a chain Iink fence,

but, Iike, covered in wire and shit.

I don't know what they caII
those kinds of fences.

Look Iike a waffIe kind of.

He had one paw Iinked in

and the other paw grasping onto the top,

and he had bitten onto
the fence with his mouth.

So he was Iike-- Dead.
Frozen Iike that.

So the rigor had set in.

My mother's Iike,
''Get that cat off the fence.''

I was, Iike, ''Why me, man?
They're not my cats.''

She's Iike, ''They're not my cats, either.''

I'm Iike, ''They're Dad's cats.''

She's Iike, ''You gonna teII your father
to take that dead cat off the fence?

He's finaIIy got some fucking peace.''

So I had to go over and try
to take the cat off.

The cat had just become
part of the fence.

It was fucking rock soIid and shit. Just--

Eyes open in terror. Just--

Looking at me Iike, ''Why didn't
you save me from the fIood?

''You couId've opened your door, man.
You feed us.

There's a responsibiIity.
We were yours.''

I'm Iike, ''You weren't mine.

We have cats inside. I'm sorry.
We couIdn't take aII''--

Having a discussion
with a dead cat on a fence.

So never had a dog. So, finaIIy,

Jen gets pregnant and whatnot.

I'm, Iike, what a great idea. Get a dog.

I can finaIIy do dog, Iike I never had.

So we went to the MenIo Park MaII,
go to the pet store,

and we're Iike, ''Do you guys
have any yeIIow Iabs?

We're Iooking for a yeIIow Iab puppy.''

The Iady's Iike,
''Oh, we have one. Over there.''

We go down the Iine.
There's aII cute IittIe dogs and shit.

And there's this one dog
which kind of Iooks Iike

it was painted to be a yeIIow Iab.

The biggest dog in the pIace,

Iike it had gotten there
when it was a puppy,

and peopIe just kept passing
it over and passing it over.

So it was in this IittIe cage
that they put the puppies in,

but was now, Iike,
kind of an adoIescent dog.

So it was Iike this.

''Can you take me out?

You have any interest
in a fucking yeIIow Iab?''

So we're Iike, ''Let's Iook at that dog.''

Opened the cage, that dog, Iike--

Like we'd invented fucking breathing
and dog food.

The dog was aII over us.

Just so in Iove instantIy and shit.

It was the onIy one there.
We were kind of impuIse buying.

We're Iike, '' AII right,
I guess we shouId get her,''

but she's bigger than a puppy.''

And I'd never had experience
with puppies.

But I was Iike, ''Is this
how big they come out?''

Jen's, Iike, ''No.
UsuaIIy they're smaII and IovabIe.

Not Iike this.''

So we got her anyway
and took her home.

Tried her on for about a week.

After a week, we were both
Iike, ''This sucks.''

Like, this thing's needy and shit.

Like, wants to eat, wants to go out,

wants to pIay.

Let's get another dog.

That way, this dog
couId pIay with that dog

and Ieave us the fuck aIone.

ExceIIent training for parenthood.

So we decided to go get another dog.

This time, we weren't gonna
buy it at the maII.

'Cause this one was sIightIy retarded.

Aside from just being
oversized and whatnot,

ScuIIy's just not right in the head, man.

She's just reaIIy fucking dumb.

Some dogs are kind of goofy dumb,

but yeIIow Iabs
are supposed to be reaI smart.

They're the dogs they train
to drag bIind peopIe around.

This dog you wouId
never want to hook up with a bIind person.

Or a Iiving person. Just not--

Not reaI good at anything
and just aIways has

a dopey fucking expression on her face.

Like, fuII of Iove
but just fuII of shit, too.

Just reaI-- Just--
[siIIy noises]-- You know.

That's my impression of ScuIIy.

Just dumber than a box of rocks.

So we decided, I guess,

maybe the maII dog's a bad idea, man,

'cause this one's stupid,

and she shits where she shouIdn't.

You're supposed to
train them to do that.

We didn't know that.

But that's not what made her stupid.

She was just fucking born retarded.

I don't think she was a yeIIow Iab.

We kept asking the person at the pet store,

''Are you sure this is a yeIIow Iab?''

She's Iike, ''Oh, yes. Lab-Iike. It's yeIIow.''

She's definiteIy some kind
of crossbred dog. Not fuII Iab.

'Cause then we finaIIy met
what a reaI Iab is.

We decided not to go back to the pet store
and get another dog.

We decided to Iook for a breeder's kenneI.

There's one in MiddIetown,
on the highway, I aIways pass.

''Breeders KenneI.
Certified Puppies. Pedigreed Puppies.''

So we went in to get that dog.

Now, I was fucking bIown away
when we bought ScuIIy,

because the dog was 600 bucks.

I was just, Iike,
who the fuck pays for dogs?

Because don't they just
throw that shit away

at the A.S.P.C.A. or whatever?

Like, at the kenneI--

If the dogcatcher picks up a dog,

they hang out for a week.

If they don't get adopted,
they chuck them out.

You'd imagine we can just
go get one for free.

Jen was just Iike, ''YeIIow Iabs--

''They don't chuck out yeIIow Iabs.

You gotta go buy dogs Iike that.''

So when I went to the pet store
and bought ScuIIy,

and they said, ''600 bucks,''

I was Iike, ''You're out
of your fucking mind.

I can go get fucking 16 dogs
for Iess than that, man.

Ones they're just gonna
burn in a week, so''--

[audience members]
Aww!

I hate to break it to you,

but that's what they do with those dogs.

Everyone's just, Iike, ''Oh,
the puppy kenneI and shit.''

If they don't fucking
get rid of them, they're, Iike--

But aII dogs go to heaven,
so it aII works out.

So I was Iike,
''600 bucks, man! Come on.''

She's Iike, ''This is training
for parenthood, so 600 bucks--

What are you worried about?
600 bucks is nothing.''

I was Iike, ''Yeah, you're right.
600 bucks, I guess. Whatever.''

So I was going into the kenneI

expecting to pay roughIy
the same fucking thing.

Maybe Iess, because this dog
wouId be smaIIer than ScuIIy,

'cause ScuIIy was aIready
aImost haIf grown-up.

So we went in, and they
had these beautifuI IittIe Iab puppies

that are, Iike, this big
and shit Iike that.

You couId just
put them in your mouth,

you Iove them so much.

I Iove you.

Bunch of them skittering around and shit.

Just aII dopey, running into
one another, pIaying and shit.

Jen found one, picked it up.
Said, ''Oh, I Iove this one.''

It was a IittIe boy. We had a girI,

so we're Iike, ''Let's get a boy.''

We had a ScuIIy. Let's get a MuIder.

So she was Iike,
''This is the one I want.''

I was Iike, ''Right on.''

So took it up to the counter,
sIapped it up there.

''How much?''

Chick was Iike, ''$6,000.''

I was Iike, ''You are out
of your fucking mind, man!

I just bought a dog for 600 bucks
just Iike this!''

She's Iike, ''Not Iike this.
This is a pedigreed dog

''bred by two compIeteIy separate--

''Not inbred, doesn't come
from a puppy farm.

''They wiII have no hip dysphasia.

''They wiII be abIe to make
your coffee in the morning.

''This dog was bred for success.

''This is the perfect fucking dog,

''and you pay for quaIity.

''That's what this dog costs.
If you don't want it, fine.

Somebody eIse wiII buy it.''

And Jen I hadn't known
too Iong at this point.

We were onIy in the second
month of our reIationship.

So I'm Iooking over at her,
and she's, Iike-- You know.

I don't wanna be the guy

who's Iike, ''You can't buy that fucking dog!

Let's get out of here!'' You know.

So I was just Iike,
''AII right. Fucking fine.''

So I sheIIed out for the fucking dog.

Worth every penny.

Just insane-- insane
how fucking good that dog is.

MuIder is an amazing fucking dog.

MuIder's the most human
fucking dog, I think,

that has ever fucking Iived.

You know, Iike they taIk about Lassie.

Be, Iike, ''Timmy's in what?
Timmy's in the weII?''

Lassie's a made-up character.

Fucking MuIder is reaI.

Based on a made-up character, but...

But just so insaneIy fucking smart.

And so empathetic and shit Iike that,

knows your moods and whatnot.

We can fucking get MuIder
away from doing bad things

just by going ''Ooh.''

MuIder use to do something remoteIy bad,

and we'd be Iike, ''Ooh,''
and he'd be Iike, ''Oh.''

And not fucking cower in fear

Iike he's gonna get hit, but just be--

you know, MuIder wouId be jumping
up on the couch,

and we'd be Iike, ''Ooh.''

We didn't even yeII,

Iike, ''MuIder, get off the fucking couch!''

We'd just be Iike, ''Ooh,''
and he wouId be Iike...

And just suIk in shame and shit.

Like, ''I'm better than this.''

''You're right. I shouIdn't
be up on the fucking couch.

''That's my bad.

''Can I do something to make it up to you?

Here's your $6,000 back.''

He's just a fucking good dog, man.

ReaI fucking good.

You know, so good
that he makes the other one

Iook even fucking worse and shit.

Where you're just Iike,

''Oh, you're just-- You are fucking--

''You are a goIden gift
from the Lord HimseIf.

''What the fuck happened to you?

Take a page out of this guy's book.''

And for years,
we had ScuIIy and MuIder.

And ScuIIy we had fixed and shit

because we didn't
want to have any puppies.

MuIder we didn't have fixed

because he never showed
an interest in sex whatsoever.

And if you spend
your whoIe Iife with ScuIIy,

it's easy to know why.

Because I'm sure he's just
Iike, ''I'm not gonna fuck her.

She's retarded.''

Never showed an interest in sex,

and we never had to have him fixed.

MuIder got to keep his nuts and shit.

And I guess for Iabs

you're supposed to get rid of their nuts
because it heIps--

I mean, if they have their nuts,

cancer kind of breeds
better or something.

I don't know. You hear some shit.

But I was Iike,
''Let him have his nuts.

He's got nothing eIse in Iife.

''He's not aIIowed on the couch,

''We're aIways 'oohing'
at him and shit.

Just Iet him keep his goddamn baIIs.''

And it was never a probIem.

He never tried to fuck ScuIIy,
never showed an interest.

Other girI dogs waIked past and shit,

he was never Iike ''uhh,'' you know.

Just asexuaI as a motherfucker.

The onIy time he showed any interest
in sex whatsoever,

EIiza Dushku came to our house
with a dog and it was her dog,

and it was a boy dog...

Yeah!

And MuIder was aII over
that fucking dog, man.

Not just sniffing its ass, but just Iike...

And we were Iike, ''MuIder's gay.''

You know?

He has no interest in ScuIIy,
he wants to fuck this boy dog.

But I'm sure he was just Iike,
''My options are Iimited.

''It's fuck her or fuck him.

And I'II fuck him because that sucks.''

Never showed an interest in sex
beyond that fucking dog,

and that dog wasn't around very much,

so it never occurred to us
to get him fixed or anything Iike that.

We just thought he was over it,

because at this point he was seven,
aImost eight years oId.

And so we thought
he was beyond sex.

When we got Louis--
Louis was a girI dog.

Louis was Iike a fucking
post-New Year's Eve party purchase

on January 1st.

This is the danger of opening a maII
on New Year's Day.

Sitting around, kind of hung over--

me and Jen and Shay taIking about dogs

and Iike, ''WouIdn't it be
great to get a chocoIate Iab?''

[imitates inhaIing]

[stoned voice]
''It wouId.

'''Cause it wouId be Iike

a reverse Oreo thing going on.''

And after two hours of fucking drunken,

hung-over, high discussion
about getting another dog,

Jen was just Iike, ''Let's do it!

We're aduIts now.
Let's get another dog.''

And I was Iike, I can't
beIieve she's saying this.

It wouId have been more--
Iess shocking if she had said,

''Let's me, you, and Shay
fuck right now.''

I wouId have beIieved that.

For her to say, Iike,
''Let's get a third dog,''

I was just Iike,
''What are you, fucking high?''

And she was.

Louis turned out okay, and Jen was Iike,

''That's it. Three dogs.
No more,'' and shit.

So Jen takes off.

I say to HarIey, ''Let's go buy Shecky.''

We go to the pet store--

same pet store where we bought
Louis the maII dog--

they had one dachshund girI.

And I didn't want to get
a boy because, you know,

they fucking piss aII over
and shit Iike that.

It's Iike, ''Let's get a girI.''

So we went and got a girI and shit.

And we're pIaying with her.

You know, you get to
test drive it in the store.

PIaying with the dog,

and the kid's Iike, ''I Iove her.

I Iove Shecky!'' and shit Iike that.

I was Iike, ''I Iove her, too.
This is gonna be awesome.

Thank God your mother's not here.''

Jen caIIed on my ceII phone
to teII me she had Ianded.

Because she was onIy going
to San Francisco.

So I was Iike, ''HeIIo?''
She was Iike, ''Hey, I'm here.''

I was Iike, ''Great. You're safe?

Was it a good trip?''
She's Iike, ''Yeah.''

In the background you just hear ''Yip.''

And she was Iike, ''What was that?

And I was Iike, ''That's MuIder.

''It didn't sound Iike MuIder.

And I was Iike, ''No. It totaIIy is.''

She's Iike, ''Where's HarIey?''
I was Iike, ''HarIey's here.''

And HarIey's Iike,
''I Iove you, Shecky.

And she's Iike, ''Did she
just say 'Shecky'?''

She was Iike, ''You're not fucking
buying another dog, are you?''

And I was Iike, ''WeII, not yet.''

She's Iike, ''You went
to the fucking pet store.

You're at the pet store right now.''

I was Iike,
''No. We're just Iooking.''

She's Iike, ''You can Iook
aII you want, Kevin.

Do not bring another dog home.''

I was Iike, ''I won't, man. I won't.''

She said, ''You're buying it, aren't you?''

And I was waiting for the chick
to hand my credit card back.

'Cause my wife's got big ears
and they're fineIy tuned, man.

She can hear the swiping
of a credit card.

And she's Iike,
''I can't fucking beIieve you.''

I said, ''It'II be fine.
Don't worry about it, man.

''I'm not reaIIy going through with it.

It was just an exercise for
the kid because it's funny.''

And she's Iike,
''Don't bring that dog home.''

I was Iike, ''I won't.''

Hung up, put the dog
in a box to traveI home.

ImmediateIy, it just started yeIping.

And I was Iike, ''Fuck.

Why is this dog so needy?''

So I was Iike, ''You gotta
hoId Shecky, HarIey,

''because she's aII barking and shit,

and she don't want to be in that box.

She's scared, maybe, or something.''

She's Iike, ''WeII,
I don't want to hoId it. She's scratchy.''

And I was Iike, ''I thought you had my
fucking back an hour ago, man.''

You wanted Shecky
and we were gonna have fun

and make fun of her and shit, you know?

Because that the whoIe reason
to get a hot dog dog--

just to point at them and be Iike,
''Isn't that fucked up?''

We didn't even get a reaI dachshund.

We got a miniature dachshund,
which I didn't know.

I just saw the sign
that said ''dachshund.''

I was Iike, ''Give me that.''

And when I got home,

and Jen was just Iike,
''This is reaIIy smaII.''

I was Iike, ''WeII, it's a puppy.''

She's Iike, ''WeII, it's two months oId.

It shouId be bigger than this.''

I'm Iike, ''I don't know.

They're wiener dogs.
How big can they get?''

''Look at her. Isn't it fucked up?''

She's Iike, ''Give me the receipt.''

She's Iike, ''This is
a miniature dachshund.''

I'm Iike, ''What does that mean?

Aren't they aII smaII
when they come out?''

She's Iike, ''It means it'II never get bigger
than this.

I was Iike,
''You're fucking shitting me.

You see how smaII this dog is?''

You can IiteraIIy
put Shecky in your mouth.

Not the whoIe dog,

but just the head wouId
be popping out Iike...

So I was Iike, ''Jesus Christ.''

I fucked up and I got a dog
that's never gonna get big.

A defective fucking weird IittIe dog.

BoundIess fucking energy,

won't Ieave the other fucking dogs aIone.

Won't Ieave us aIone and shit Iike that.

Loves fucking MuIder.

Loves to jump up
and grab MuIder's ears.

She jumps up, grabs his ear, bites,

and then faIIs to the ground.

So MuIder spends most
of his day Iike this.

You know, just--

And MuIder tries to put on a mean face.

Every once in a whiIe

you'II see him put on a mean face
where he goes ''Uhh,''

but she don't buy it.

So she Iives to torment the dog,

is constantIy biting his face,

constantIy biting, jumping,

grabbing his hair, faIIing down,

and yanking hair
out of his body and shit.

And he was has this Iook of,
''Dude, I'm in my goIden years.

''You reaIIy had to bring this home?

This is fucking horribIe.''

But MuIder got his fucking revenge

in a weird way

because Shecky was
too IittIe to get fixed

when we got the dog.

You see where it's going, don't you?

And suddenIy, the dog

that never showed interest
in sex in his Iife

turned into Jason Mewes overnight.

It was fucking crazy.

MuIder never had anything but disregard

for that IittIe dog,

except to try to swat her away and shit.

One day, Shecky went into heat.

And I didn't know what that was,

because ScuIIy was fixed,
Louis was fixed.

I had never seen a dog
go into heat and shit.

Started seeing IittIe bIood drops
around the house.

And I was Iike, ''What is it?

And she was Iike, ''She's in heat.''

I was Iike, ''Ew, she's having a dog period?''

''WeII, fucking stick
a tampon up there, man.''

But you couIdn't
stick a tampon in Shecky.

It wouId just bIow her up
three times the size she is.

She's Iike, ''That's not how it works.

We have to get this dog fixed.''

And we took the dog to the vet.

The vet's Iike, ''You can't fix her now.

She's in heat.

You gotta wait tiII heat's over.''

I was Iike, ''God damn it.''

So we're running around with toweIs,

cIeaning up after Shecky and shit

when she makes her
IittIe bIood dropIets.

But MuIder smeIIed fucking
sex in the air, you know?

That's how it works, I guess.

I had never seen him behave Iike--

I swear to God it was JekyII and Hyde.

He went from being
the caImest dog in the worId

to just being humping anything
that that dog was near,

incIuding trying to hump that dog.

He spent two weeks trying to--

desperateIy trying to fuck that dog.

Now, MuIder stands about this taII

and he's a fuII-grown yeIIow Iab.

Shecky is as big as this microphone.

No, reaIIy. This is not
a bad artist's rendering.

You put two Iegs here, two Iegs here,

and a taiI that stands up
and crooks at the end,

that's fucking Shecky.

So something that big
tried to fuck something that smaII.

And you couIdn't stop him, man.

He was a man on a fucking mission and shit.

You put him outside the door--
the first time he ever did it--

he started fucking scratching
on the bedroom door aII desperateIy.

You open the door
and be Iike, ''Can I heIp you?

He'd shoot past you

and immediateIy go to fucking Shecky

and stick his nose up her ass.

And we're Iike, ''Dude, stop it.

That's just not-- You can't do that.

That dog's too IittIe'' and shit.

He didn't know the meaning of too IittIe.

He did not accept it and shit.

He just hunted that fucking dog.

And everyone kept saying,
''You gotta keep him away.

Keep him away from fucking Shecky
because she's in heat'' and whatnot.

''Since you can't get her fixed,
keep her in her cage.''

So we'd put her in her cage.

She had a IittIe cage Iike this
that she sIept in at night,

and the IittIe Iatch that cIoses it.

But open and shit. Not a pIastic thing.

It just Iooked Iike a IittIe jaiI ceII.

Put Shecky in it, and we're Iike,

''At Ieast if she's in the cage,
he can't get to her,

so we can Iet MuIder
back into the room.''

Right to the cage.

He started humping
the fucking cage, man.

And Shecky's pinned
on the other waII, Iike...

''What the fuck's going on?

What is that red thing?''

It's true, man. I had never
seen MuIder's red thing.

I saw it a bunch
over the two weeks, man.

My man was just aIways
unsheathed and ready to go.

And I don't know how it fucking works,

but it Iooks Iike it's aIready
sticky with cum to begin with.

I don't know if dogs reach a point

where ''Uhh'' and there's an orgasm,

or it's just Iike,
''It's aIways cum time, baby.

Let me just get it up there.''

AII over that fucking cage,
man. It was insane.

We were Iike, ''MuIder,
show some fucking dignity.''

He's Iike, ''I fucking--

You don't know how badIy I want to.''

Like, ''I wish.''

He's going, ''You can
'ooh' me to death right now,

''and it wouIdn't affect me.
I know better than this,

''but I need to fuck that IittIe dog, man.

''This ain't me.
This is fucking nature.

''You can't fucking stand
between me and pussy.

Not now, not for the next two weeks.

You better shoot me now

because I'm gonna fuck that IittIe dog

before it's aII over.

We Ieft fucking him
and her in her cage,

in the room, had to go out and shit,

came back, the cage is just
caked in fucking semen.

AImost as if he was
standing outside the cage,

just Iike, ''Look at it.''

''I'II be back in an hour.''

And she wouId have fucking--
I don't know what it was--

because, again, I've never
watched a dog come.

It's Iike there's dog porn where he's Iike...

and shoots on another dog's back.

It's just--

GeneraIIy that happens inside,
and you know what happens.

But she had shit matted aII over her

that was awfuIIy cakey
and fucking white.

So it was just a fucking
horror show for a whiIe.

And then, fucking one day,
we came home

and somebody didn't put Shecky
in the fucking cage.

Nobody saw it, don't know
what the fuck happened.

Shecky, whose vag I had never noticed,

was dragging 4 inches

down to the fIoor behind her.

Shecky had the biggest Iabia
I've ever seen in my Iife.

AII of a sudden, you couId find Shecky easy

because there were
snaiI traiIs to foIIow.

It was fucking crazy.

And I was Iike, ''What's aII this?''

And then the traiI Ied to fucking Shecky,

who's just fucking Iaying there Iike--


And she's got Iips hanging out
Ionger than her taiI, man.

I'm Iike, ''Has the dog
aIways had this big a pussy?''

And Jen was Iike, ''Let me s--
Oh, my God! He fucked her!''

''MuIder, why'd you fuck her?''

And MuIder's just sitting there Iike,

''You don't have to fucking berate me.

''I'm hating myseIf right now.

''You don't understand how much
I hate that IittIe dog,

but I had to fuck it.

''You guys Iet her out of
the cage, and we did it.

And sorry, but I'II do it
again if you don't stop me.''

And Jen got-- Jen's a reaI feminist and shit.

She just don't Iike men
very much, which is--

I think she onIy married me
because my dick's so smaII,

I might as weII not be a dude.

Might as weII be a chick.

She hates men,

and she's aIways Iooking
for more reasons to hate men,

and she's Iike,
''He raped that IittIe dog.

Just Iike aII men do.
He's a IittIe rapist.''

And I was Iike, ''When a dog
fucks another dog, it's not reaIIy rape.

That's what they do and shit.
I don't think Shecky--''

''You think Shecky wanted this?
Look at her!''

To be honest, she didn't
Iook Iike she wanted it.

The dog Iooked fucking sheII-shocked
Iike you read about.

It was just Iike, ''Something as big
as me entered me?

''Left, came back,
kept making up its mind

whether to come in and go,

''and dropped a Ioad and waIked away.

What the fuck?''

And MuIder was just sitting there Iike,

''There's fucking payback
for biting my ears aII those times.''

But just fuII of shame.
You couId teII he hated himseIf.

Sometimes you fuck someone
and you're Iike,

''Oh, God. Why did I fuck that person?''

And you'II go back and do it again

because they're wiIIing to
give it up for free and shit.

And you're Iike-- Every time
you're in the middIe of fucking,

''I hate myseIf for fucking this person,
but I wanna come.''

That's what MuIder was.

He was just a beast that wanted
to fucking come and shit.

Hating every minute of it,

just Iike, ''I can't stand that IittIe dog,

but I'm sorry, I had to bust a nut in her.''

And it was fucking horrifying,
just horrifying to Iook at.

And then the horrifying notion set in

that maybe he impregnated her.

At first, I was just Iike,
''That can't happen.

He's a Iab, she's a dachshund.''

I taIked to a dog trainer friend of mine.

He was Iike, ''What are you, fucking stupid?

''You think breeds can't cross breeds?

''It's a dog, man.

A dog fucks another dog,
IittIe dogs come out.''

And I was just Iike, oh, my God.

I don't want to see the product
of this unhoIy union.

'Cause you have a Iab,
a good-sized Iab,

and a tiny fucking miniature dachshund.

I just pictured a IittIe dog--

a tiny dog body, massive Iab head.

So big it can't even support it.

Just aIways...

head pinned to the ground,

and the body just
kind of waIks around it.

Never abIe to move,
just Iooking at me with these eyes of Iike,

''Why'd you Iet him fuck her?

KiII me now.''

So we were worried

that we were going to have to take the dog
to get an abortion,

which brought up aII sorts of unethicaI
and ethicaI questions where I was just Iike,

''Look, I'm pro-choice, but this is kind of--

ShouIdn't we ask her how she feeIs?''

So he fucked that IittIe dog, man,

and it made Iife
reaIIy uncomfortabIe

in our house for a Iong time

because it's not pretty

when you're fucking sitting on the bed,

and the IittIe dog
jumps up on the bed,

and then it takes about two minutes

for the rest of her to get on the bed,

because her Iips are stiII dangIing
on the fIoor and shit.

And then she kind of goes
back to normaI afterwards.

She doesn't dweII on it
as much as you do.

I wouId just obsess on it

and think about, Iike,
''That's so fucked up, man.

How'd it happen?''

I mean, I know how it happened,

but Iike, ''Why weren't we
here to videotape it?''

'Cause if it's gonna happen,
I wanted to fucking see it.

And I did feeI a IittIe bad for her
untiI fucking Iater in the week

I caught her fucking
coming on to the dude.

Because for a whiIe, it just seemed
Iike he was agro

and crazy for her and shit.

''Do you fucking smeII that in the air?

That sex? I want to fuck.''

And you couId, after a whiIe,
smeII the fucking scent Iike--

you know, dog, femaIe dog,
give off that weird scent,

and it was fucking powerfuI.

It didn't make me
want to fuck her, but it was--

it was pretty fucking powerfuI.

I thought it was just him
attracted to the scent

and she wanted no part of him.

He'd fucked her,
he'd got it out of his system.

I was Iike, ''We don't have to
keep her in the cage anymore

because it ain't gonna happen again.

She knows how to defend herseIf now.
She knows what to expect.

If he starts coming at her
with the red thing,

she's gonna run away.

Sitting on the bed, watching TV,
typing on the computer.

I Iook over, MuIder's Iaying
on his fucking IittIe dog bed.

Shecky, you aIways hear
padding around.

She's got these naiIs,
waIks on the wood fIoor,

and she's got a IittIe beII
on her coIIar, so you hear her coming.

WaIked right over to MuIder
and fucking presented.

So bizarre. WaIked over to him,

turned her ass to him,
just went Iike this.

And not even came over to him,
''Hey, you want to pIay?''

LiteraIIy stuck her ass up in the air
at his fucking face.

So sexy that I was Iike,
''I might fuck her, dude,''

If my wife came over
to the bed to me,

and was just Iike, ''HeIIo.''

I'd be Iike, ''Oh, Jesus Christ!''

I grabbed Shecky and I was Iike,
''Get in the fucking cage, you sIut. Stop it.''

And then, fucking she went out of heat,
and they acted Iike nothing happened.

So, fuck, you'd imagine
that they wouId fucking hoId

a IittIe bit of iII feeIings
toward one another or just Iike,

''Remember that time when you fucked me
and you're just so big and I'm so IittIe,

and, Iike, you thought Iike I wouId
just disappear essentiaIIy,

or I'd become Iike
a condom for your cock.''

A German condom, you know.

But they just went
back to normaI.

She went out of heat and shit,

and suddenIy that IittIe dog just behaved

the same way that she aIways behaved
with MuIder and shit--

just jumping up and grabbing his ears,

and he was aIways Iike this.

He'd Iook at me with those forIorn eyes.

I'd be Iike, ''Fuck you, buddy.
That's your girIfriend.''

So I've taIked to my kid
about doing that as a movie,

but it doesn't reaIIy--

I don't know if it wouId work.

Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

How are you, sir?

ExceIIent. How are you, sir?

Very weII. A IittIe sweaty, but okay.

Same here.
Right on.

First of aII, I wiII suck your dick off
if you answer my question.

[audience whoops]

Where were you when I
was singIe, man? Like--

Where were even the maIe overtures

of ''I'II suck your cock
for something simpIe.''

Right on, man.

Now I'm married. It'd be weird.

I'm not gay, but for you anything.

That's kinda cooI. You don't--

Look, cock sucking and gay
are not the same things.

My question for you is
what is your favorite moment

in your entire career--
Iike, working in movies,

writing scripts,
writing comic books, acting--

Do you have a moment

where you Iook back
on your entire career up to this point

and say, ''Now, that was awesome''?

Yeah. Shit. Tons.

I mean--
[audience member] Now suck him!

[Iaughter, appIause]

AII right, Iet's go. Let's go.

TechnicaIIy, he's right, dude.

''Yeah, sure'' is definiteIy
an answer to that question.

So you're saying you reaIIy
want your dick sucked right now

is what you're saying.

I'm kinda--

[audience groans]
What?

I'm preoccupied at the moment.

However, if you can kind find
somebody eIse to suck off,

I wouId Iove to sit here,
watch, and jerk off.

No. No.

I won't do it.

Just one dude. Just sit up here, just--

This pIace wouId faII
fucking siIent, dude.

It wouId be amazing.

You know how many copies
of the DVD we'd seII?

''I Iiked that Superman story
from the first one,

''but this dude, Iike, got up
and sucked another dude off,

''and it was fucking riveting.

''And the fucking Clerks guy just sat there

and jerked off onto their faces.''

''His kid was crying backstage.

''His wife had a puzzIed expression.

I think his mother just Ieft.''

Anyway.

Since it's not going to happen

because you seem fucking unwiIIing...

I don't have any voIunteers.

[audience member]
Ask him a new question!

He doesn't have
to ask a new question.

It was a good question.

Just he, you know--

He buried the Iead a IittIe bit.

He was just Iike,
''I'm gonna ask this question

and then try to forget about
the offer for cock sucking.''

ActuaIIy, you didn't bury the Iead.

You came up right in front and said,

''I wiII suck your cock if you answer this.''

That's not burying the Iead,
that's starting strong.

You finished weak, though.

'Cause finishing strong
wouId have been Iike--

[sIurping noises]

Anyway, what was my favorite moment
of my entire career?

Is that it? The big moment?

The moment that I was Iike, ''Ah.''

HonestIy, every day
has been kind of Iike that

since the moment
that we got into Sundance.

Even when we were making Clerks,
it was kind of cooI.

''I can't beIieve I'm doing this because I
don't normaIIy do this kind of shit.''

Clerks ll was a big highIight for me.

And I know some cats didn't dig on it.

Most cats seemed to dig on it.
It kind of worked.

I Iove that fucking movie,

and it was just
such a great experience

from the moment I started writing it

to the moment we fucking
took it to Cannes,

got a standing ovation.

Even the theatricaI reIease
I was happy with.

Just couIdn't have been better.

But just fuII of wonderfuI things
from day one.

It was awesome,
under great fucking circumstances.

We got to make it reaIIy cheapIy,

so nobody was around to fuck with us,

nobody was just Iike, ''Put J-Lo in it.''

Nothing Iike that.

Went off and shot it.

The onIy sad thing
is we didn't shoot it here.

We shot some of the stuff here.

AII the Quick Stop stuff, obviousIy.

But the majority of it,

aII the stuff that
was shot at the movies,

we shot in Long Beach.

Just outside of Long Beach.
Buena Park, it's caIIed.

Right across the street
from Knott's Berry Farm in CaIifornia.

Because we were Iooking
for a pIace to shoot--

We needed a fast food joint,
because otherwise,

we were gonna have to
buiId one from scratch.

And buiIding a fast food joint
wouId have been cost prohibitive

based on our budget.

So we had to find
a cIosed-down fast food joint

which, in the United States of America,
is fucking impossibIe to do.

You cannot find a cIosed
fast food joint, man,

because fucking the moment
one of them shutters,

if they ever shutter,

another one swoops in and buys it,

and fucking opens up and shit.

We had one pIace, actuaIIy, out here

which we were Iooking at,
and we're Iike, shit,

it's cIosing, we're gonna go get it,

and a fucking Wendy's just pimped in
and were Iike, ''Fuck you.

We're gonna Biggie size it,''
and just took it over.

InstantIy! Just fucking
right out from under us.

So there was a deIay in shooting
because we couIdn't find

a fucking fast food joint to shoot at.

And finaIIy, we found one
in Buena Park

where somebody
buiIt a Burger King off the beaten path.

You know how you go
to Great Adventure and shit out here,

and as you drive down the strip--

Whoo, Great Adventure.

You drive down the strip,
there's, Iike, McDonaId's,

there's a bunch of mini maIIs, gas stations,

peopIe put up attractions
and shit Iike that

because they know you gotta pass it
to get to Great Adventure,

so you're going to patronize their bus--

better chance of patronizing their business.

Same thing in Knott's Berry Farm.

There's this big street
and there are a bunch of shit

that has been buiIt up
around Knott's Berry Farm.

Knott's Berry Farm is apparentIy
the first amusement park in America,

and pIaces have buiIt up around it.

Because they see peopIe
come crowd to that pIace, they're Iike,

''Fuck it. We're gonna buiId shit.''

So they buiIt a MedievaI Times there,

they buiIt a Pirates Adventure Theater,

you got your fucking McDonaId's,

you got a HoIIywood Wax Museum
and shit Iike--

Everyone buiIds on the strip,

aII these IittIe tourist traps

before you get to your main destination.

This Burger King Iooked at the strip,
and was Iike, ''Fuck it.

We're gonna buiId over there.''

And they went to a street
buried behind another street

where you can't even fucking
see it from Knott's Berry Farm.

So there's no chance of you
driving into Knott's Berry Farm

going Iike, ''I feeI Iike a Whopper, man.

Where's the nearest Burger King?''

You'd be Iike, ''WhiIe we're here...

Fuck it. Let's just go to the park.''

You wouId never see this joint.

IronicaIIy, from the Burger King
you can see Knott's Berry Farm.

It was Iike a dude
was so fucking confident,

he's just Iike, ''I don't need to buiId it
''near Knott's Berry Farm.

''It's Burger King. They'II fucking come.

''So I'm gonna buiId it over there
where it's cheaper.

And watch, watch them fIock.''

And he buiIt this massive
fucking parking Iot around it

the size of two fucking footbaII fieIds.

LittIe Burger King, huge parking Iot,

as if he was just Iike,

''BuiId a Iot of parking,
'cause they're coming.

''We need as much parking
as Knott's Berry Farm

because everyone Ioves
a fucking Whopper.''

And then it went out of business.

SIowIy went out of business and shit.

Left this Burger King to fucking rot.

We were Iike, ''Can we have it?

And they're Iike, ''We're gonna
knock it down, buiId condos.

But if you can get it done

in a month and a haIf, it's yours.''

Gave it to us reaI inexpensiveIy.

Went in, turned the pIace into Mooby's.

That's where we shot
most of the fIick.

But when we were
scouting out the joint,

I saw that there's a fucking moteI
right next to it.

Days Inn MoteI.

I was Iike, ''This is kinda pimp,''

because I saw a sign that
said ''Rooms $40 a Night.''

And I was Iike, ''40 fucking doIIars?''

How horribIe must it be in there?

40 bucks doesn't buy you
a Iot and shit, but 40 bucks--

that just sounds
Iike a hooker hoteI to me.

The kind of pIace where you're Iike,
''I'II give you 20 bucks for haIf an hour,''

and they're Iike, ''SoId.''

So, we were there-- it was me
and Scott Mosier and Laura GreenIee.

And I was just Iike, ''Laura, you know

how we get the traiIers for the actors

''to hang out in between takes
and shit Iike that?

You know, the two-bangers--''

These two IittIe kind of apartments

and this traiIer thing.

''What if we just got
rooms at the Days Inn

because it's onIy 40 bucks a night.

''If you did the math,

is that roughIy gonna be
what it wouId cost us

to rent those traiIers for a month and shit?''

She's Iike,
''Let me run some numbers.''

She ran some numbers, she was Iike,

''We can get a bunch of rooms.

''It wouId be roughIy aggregate the cost

of what it wouId be
to rent some two-bangers

and some traiIers and shit Iike that.''

She's going, ''PIus,
if we're getting a bunch of rooms,

they'II probabIy give us a discount.''

So she went over there,
taIked to them and shit.

They wound up giving us the rooms
essentiaIIy for $20 a night.

So it turned out we were going
to go to the Days Inn and shit.

So I was taIking to Mewes about it.

Mewes was Iiving with us at the time.

And he said, ''Are we getting
our own traiIers this time,

or are we in two-bangers?
What?''

I said, ''No, dude.
We're getting hoteI rooms.''

He's Iike, ''HoteI rooms?''

And I was Iike, ''WeII, technicaIIy
it's a moteI because you drive up to it.

''HoteI-- there's a buiIding, you enter,

take an eIevator up to your room

''and shit Iike that,
they put a mint on your piIIow.

''MoteI is just Iike
you and the hooker puII up,

''open your door right off
your car, get inside,

''cIose the fucking dirty curtain,

and do your horribIe
Shecky-Iike business.''

So, um, I was Iike, ''Yeah, it's a moteI.''

And he's Iike,
''Do I get my own room?''

I was Iike, ''Yeah,

you'II totaIIy get your own room and shit.''

He was Iike, ''That's awesome.''

So I was packing up my shit,
brought my DVD pIayer,

a bunch of DVDs,
aII my cIothes and shit,

because my pIan was I was going
to Iive down in Buena Park during the week,

shoot the movie, and on weekends
come home and shit Iike that.

Just didn't want to fight traffic
back and forth every morning.

AIso, we decided to take
one of the moteI rooms

and set it up as the editing bay--

bring the Avid editing system
down there, set it up,

so between takes
and at the end of the day,

I can just go edit the movie.

And it operated as a IittIe studio and shit.

The IittIe fake movies
next to the reaI Days Inn

and you couId take a 30-second waIk
from one to the other.

So I was packed up
and ready to go and shit,

and I toId Mewes, ''I'm going down
the night before and shit.''

He's Iike, ''Can I go with you?''

And I was Iike, ''I guess,

but you don't shoot for the first week.''

He's Iike, ''But I wanna go get situated.''

And I was Iike, ''AII right. Right on.''

So I fucking come out of my room and shit,
bring aII my shit downstairs,

there's fucking Mewes sitting on
a piIe of his shit at the front door,

Iike a chiId at Christmas.

He's Iike, ''You ready?''

And I was Iike, ''Yeah, dude.

What, are you going to foIIow me down?''

He's Iike, ''Yeah, I'm gonna
bring my car and shit.

I'm aII packed.''

I was Iike, ''What?

''You're taking this awfuIIy seriousIy, dude.

''It's a Days Inn MoteI.

I don't want you to get your hopes up.''

He's Iike, ''No. I'm fucking psyched, dude.

This is gonna be awesome.
It's Iike going to camp.''

I was Iike, ''Right on.''

So we went down,
drove down to Buena Park.

It was at night,
so there was no traffic and shit,

got in, got our room keys,
fucking Ioaded up.

You know, unIoaded the car,
brought the shit to our rooms.

He opens his door,
he's Iike, ''This is amazing.''

And he Ioaded his shit in his room and shit.

And then I was-- immediateIy
went about taking the sheets off

and fucking putting my sheets on
because I don't want to sIeep

on the sheets everybody came on.

I want to sIeep
on my sheets that I came on.

So I'm unpacking, trying
to hook up my DVD pIayer,

and there's a fucking knock at the door.

I open it up, and it's Mewes,

and he's Iike,
''You wanna go to Target?''

I was Iike, ''It's 9:00 at night.''

He's Iike, ''I know, but I
need some home furnishings.''

I was Iike, ''I guess.
I couId pick up some toothpaste.''

And so he was Iike,
''Let's rock it. Let's go.''

So we drove to the Target,

which is down the street and shit,

and I grabbed a fucking hand basket

because I didn't need much.

Mewes grabbed two fucking carts,

bungeed them together and shit,

and just started fucking shopping
Iike he was on a game show

and he had to fiII two
cartons in two minutes,

you know, to win the grand prize.

The dude just went nuts
just going down aisIes, Iike,

''Need this, need this, need this.''

Just buying fucking everything.

Dude bought a fucking rubber pIant.

You know, moteI rooms
come with rubber pIants.

He wanted a better one.

You ever go to Target

and see the bad waII art that they seII,

and you're Iike,
''Who the fuck wouId buy it?''

Mewes bought two paintings.

And I use the term IooseIy.

He just bought some fucking waII art,

bought a bunch of shit.

The weirdest thing
I saw him buy was incense.

I was Iike, ''What's that for?

To take the fucking reeking stench
out of the room?''

And he's just Iike, ''No, man.
It's just to find my center.''

Got back to the fucking pIace and shit.

Mewes' biII was reaIIy fucking high.

It was $300 worth
of shit the dude bought.

He went to work on his room,

I went to work setting up
my DVD pIayer again.

Knocks on the door.
He's Iike, ''You wanna come see my pad?''

I was Iike, ''Right on.''

WaIked down the haIIway
and he had turned it into--

Remember the episode
of The Brady Bunch

where Greg got, you know...

got his own pad and shit?

It was that minus the fucking Iove beads.

Open the door and shit,

and he's got his fucking music pIaying,

he's got his incense burning,
fucking new waII art,

a rubber pIant and shit Iike that,

fucking set up his TV and whatnot.

He just changed it around and shit.

It was Iike an apartment
without a kitchen.

And he was so fucking happy
and proud with it and shit.

And I was Iike, ''I just want
to remind you, dude.

You don't shoot untiI next week.''

He's Iike, ''I know. But Iook, I'm done.''

As if the feng shui reaIIy fucking mattered.

He had to get that right

before he couId concentrate
on being Iike, ''Uh, okay.

Good-bye, horses,'' you know.

So I spent that night--

I'm Iike, you know,
I reaIIy shouId watch Clerks

before I start shooting Clerks ll

because I hadn't watched it in a whiIe.

So I popped that in,
stayed up tiII about 4 in the morning

watching that and trying to see
where my head space was then

versus where it is now, and do we try
to make it Iook Iike that or not?

You know, just kind of Iike the Iast minute
before the new movie began,

just kind of engrossing myseIf
in the oId movie.

And so I sIept for about two hours,
caII time was 6.

Fucking...knock at the door and shit.

Fucking stumbIed to the door,

opened it up, and there is Mewes,

who's not working that day
or that whoIe fucking week,

bright eyed and bushy taiIed.

He's Iike, ''Good morning!
You want a breakfast burrito?''

I was Iike, ''No, dude. I'm good.

What are you doing up?''

He's Iike, ''I'm up, man.

The truck's here, the food's out there.

They got some coffee.
You want some coffee?''

I was Iike, ''No, dude. I'm fine.

''I don't drink coffee.

I don't-- What the fuck
are you doing awake?''

He's Iike, ''It's day one,
man. Day one on Clerks ll.

I'II see you down there.''
Fucking pumps away, just...

Just a fucking cheerIeader.

And fucking, you know,

I finaIIy took a shower
and stumbIed downstairs,

get to the set, say hi
to everybody and shit.

Mewes is greeting peopIe
he's never met before.

''How are you? I'm Jason Mewes.

I'II be pIaying the roIe of Jay.''

You know, as if--

The cats are Iike, ''We've
seen the movies, dude.

We know who you are.''

But he was just
so fucking invigorated,

just so fucking rah-rah
and shit Iike that,

and remained that way through

most of the fucking time
we were shooting and whatnot,

and reaIIy took his apartment seriousIy.

In a big, bad way,
dude went back to Target,

bought himseIf a chair.

Like a chaise Iongue kind of chair
that you take to the beach

and spread out and sit
there and catch waves?

He set it up in front of his room.

And basicaIIy, we had these rooms
on the second fIoor of the moteI,

and they overIooked the parking Iot
or the Mooby's, and we did that because

we didn't want anybody coming on their
vacation or going to Knott's Berry Farm

going, ''What the fuck is going on?
Why is that dude's dick tucked back?''

Just so that there'd be no Iookie-Ious
and nobody to have to expIain shit to.

So Mewes is on the second fIoor
with this fucking chair

outside his fucking moteI room
door, hanging out.

Just hanging out, smoking cigarettes,
taIking to peopIe as they waIk by.

''Hey. How are you?
What are you doing today?

I'm pIaying Jay in the movie Clerks ll. ''

Dude went and got himseIf
a hibachi, a IittIe hibachi.

As if he'd watched every TV show
about peopIe who buy their first house

and was Iike, ''I need a chair outside,
and I need a barbecue griII.''

And even though we had catering on the set,
the dude sat there with his IittIe hibachi,

fucking heated it up and shit, and wouId
make fucking food for the cast and crew.

Fucking insane, you know?
Just reaIIy weird behavior.

If I hadn't known better, I wouId been Iike,
''What are you, on heroin?''

But I knew he wasn't anymore.

But he wouId be sitting up there,
and you'd be down directing and shit.

He'd be up on the second fIoor of the moteI
and shit, fucking cooking

and be Iike, ''You want a dog?
You want a dog? You want a burger?

Burger, burger, dog? Coming up.''

Whip 'em down to you.
Just a reaI fucking go-getter.

AII about it and so fucking energetic,
and reaIIy pumped everybody eIse up.

He wouId organize activities
when the day was done and shit.

On most movies, peopIe are done shooting,
they want to go home and shit.

Mewes wouId organize poker games.

Fucking one night, he was Iike,
''We aII have to go out to MedievaI Times.

You're paying, but we aII have to go.''

Just way into it. Way
into the whoIe Clerks ll fucking experience

and way into his fucking apartment,

was dreading when we were
fucking gonna wrap the show

because we were there,
essentiaIIy, for about three,

three and a haIf weeks,
four weeks of shooting.

Then we wouId wrap and go to Jersey
to shoot for about a week

of aII the exteriors of Quick Stop
and shit Iike that.

So we were getting cIose
to the end of the shoot.

And I remember taIking to
him and just being Iike,

''You know we're out of here soon.
Did you start packing?''

He's Iike, ''What do you mean?''

I was Iike, ''WeII, we have to Ieave.

When we're done, we're Ieaving.''

He was Iike, ''ReaIIy?''

I was Iike, ''WeII, you didn't think
you couId stay here, did you?''

He was Iike, ''Can you buy these pIaces?''

I was Iike, ''What,

take the fucking moteI
condo or something?''

I said, ''You don't even have a kitchen
in this motherfucker.''

He said, ''I got a hot pIate.

PIus, there's a fucking
Mooby's right next door.''

So he's Iike, ''Here I can fuck
anybody I want and shit.

I couId do things that I
can't do back at your house.

I don't have to ask anybody for permission
and shit Iike that.''

He said, ''I just Iike it here.''

And he's Iike, ''What do you think?

Can I just get this pIace?

How much do you think
it wouId be a month?''

And I said, ''You want to rent this pIace
Iike an apartment?''

I was Iike, ''You couId
probabIy get an apartment

''back in Los AngeIes

for roughIy what you
wouId pay for this.

Maybe it wouIdn't be--
You'd have a bathroom.

''You'd have to deaI with the fact

that you had a kitchen.''

But he was Iike, ''I don't know.

''I'm kinda thinking about staying.

''I'm used to it. I kind of Iike it.

''This is my home now,
and I kind of--

I got my groove on in this joint.''

I was Iike, ''WeII, I guess you can ask.

The probIem is it becomes
expensive once we Ieave.''

He's Iike, ''What are you taIking about?

I thought you said
it's 20 bucks a night.''

And I was, ''It's 20 bucks a night now

because we paid for a bunch of rooms

because the production's here,

because we took up
at Ieast 20 rooms.

But once we Ieave, it goes
back to its normaI price.''

And he's Iike, ''WeII,
how much is it normaIIy?''

And I was Iike, ''It's 40 bucks a night.''

''40 bucks a night for this shit hoIe?

Fuck it! Let's go.''

So that was cooI. During
the making of that movie,

he was just a reaI fucking
spirit bunny and shit Iike that.

It was kind of charming.

And then we were done with the movie.

Of aII the IittIe probIems,

there was nothing
insurmountabIe and shit.

We wrapped the fIick,

we showed Harvey Weinstein the movie,

and Harvey was Iike,
''I just got two notes.''

He's going, ''I think it's reaIIy funny,

but I got two notes.''

He's going, ''You show Rosario
kind of Iike, from here up.''

I was Iike, ''We shot her in cowboy,
cut her off at the knees.''

He's Iike, ''Did you ever
shoot her from head-to-toe?''

And I was Iike, ''WeII, no. Not reaIIy,

''because they're not reaIIy
doing that much of a dance.''

He's Iike, ''WeII, you got
to shoot her head-to-toe.

''That's how you shoot a dancer.

''You got to see their fuII body.
Shoot a dancer head-to-toe.

''I'II put you on the phone with Rob MarshaII.

''He made Chicago.
He'II teII you the same thing.''

And I was Iike,

what an awkward caII that wouId be.

I'm Iike, ''Hi, is this Rob MarshaII?''

He's Iike, ''Yeah, is this Clerks guy?''

I'm Iike, ''Yeah.''

He's Iike, ''WeII, you're
supposed to show a dancer

''from head-to-toe.''

''Look, I got to go, bye.'' You know?

Such a bizarre fucking phone caII
I'd have to sit through.

I was Iike, ''I don't know if we shouId.

I was Iike, ''HonestIy, they're not doing
much of a dance.''

She's wearing fucking, Iike, cords.

So, what you're seeing
from the knee down

isn't that fucking sexy.

It's not Iike they're wearing outfits

Iike they wore in Chicago,
bare-Iegged and shit.

She wearing fucking cords.

I said, ''We're seeing the reaI important part
of the scene.''

The true money,
as it were, and whatnot.

It's not Iike she's doing
some wicked shuffIe

with her feet that we're missing.

He's Iike, ''I think you shouId re-shoot.

''I think you shouId
shoot her head-to-toe.''

I was Iike, ''I guess
we couId taIk about it.

''What's the other thing?''

He's Iike, ''There's that conversation
about the pussy troII.''

I said, ''Yeah, yeah.
Fucking piIIow pants.''

He's Iike, ''Yeah, piIIow pants.''

He's going, ''I reaIIy think--

''You have this whoIe
conversation about this thing,

''and they're sitting there taIking.

''I reaIIy think you need
to show that thing.''

And I was Iike, ''You do know
they don't exist, right?''

He's Iike, ''Yes, I fucking
know they don't exist.

''But you can't just sit there

''and have a fucking conversation
about a pussy troII

''and not show it.

''They sit there for two minutes
taIking about this thing,

''and we never get to see it.

''That's just bad cinema.

''You need to put it in there,
particuIarIy for Europeans.

''They want to see shit.

''They don't want to hear you
taIking about a pussy troII.

''You got to fucking shoot a pussy troII

and put it in that movie.''

I was Iike, ''I don't know how the fuck
we're expected to do that

''because it doesn't exist.''

The reason that scene works

is because whoever
is watching the movie,

first, they have an idea in their head
of what a pussy troII is.

And their idea is going to be way better

than anything I couId show them
because in their head,

they can make up aII sorts
of weird nonsense and shit.

I put it out there--

What am I going to do, shove it out
Iike one of those troII doIIs?

Be Iike, ''This is a pussy troII.''

With my hand hoIding it
on camera and shit?

It wouId Iook Iike
that scene in Spiderman,

where Spiderman and the Green GobIin

are on the top of the buiIding
taIking to one another.

You got two dudes,
you can't see their mouths.

They're just wearing masks.
They're just taIking Iike this.

It just Iooks Iike peopIe
were hoIding action figures.

Going, Iike, ''Join me, Spiderman,

''so we can be fucking cooI buds.''

''I don't want to do that, Green GobIin.''

So, I was just Iike, ''I just don't--

''The reason I feeI
Iike that scene works is

''you have two guys in that scene.

''There's one guy in the scene
who, with aII of his heart,

''beIieves that there is
such a thing as a pussy troII.

''And then you have the other guy,

''who represents
everybody eIse in the worId,

''just reacting to him the way
that most peopIe wouId.

''Just Iike fucking
sheII-shocked, you know,

''jaw dropped, Iike,
'This dude's fucking insane.'

''That's what's funny about It.

''The minute you show it,

''you're Iending credence
to the first guy

''because there's a smaII portion
of the audience that's Iike,

'''God damn it, is that
what a pussy troII is?'

''You run the risk
of Iending the idiot credibiIity.

''So I don't think you shouId show it.''

He's Iike, ''I'm going
to demand you show it.

''You shouId fucking do it.

''I'm going to make you do it
and give you the money.

''You need to show it.
I think it'II make it even funnier.''

So he Ieft, and me and Mosier
were reaIIy sweating it,

Iike, ''What the fuck do we do, man?

''I don't want to show the pussy troII.

''It's funny because you don't
show the pussy troII.

''It's just chatter,
something to fucking taIk about.''

I was Iike, ''Maybe we
just fucking dress up Mewes as a troII.''

''And just buiId a giant
wooden Iabia around him.

''Just have him sit under it, going Iike--''

And, you know, Mosier's
aII Iaid back, smooth.

He's Iike, ''CouId work.''

So I hit up Mewes, I was Iike,

''Dude, we might need ''to go back
and do a IittIe re-shooting.''

He's Iike, ''What?''

I was Iike, ''We're going to need
to shoot the pussy troII.''

He was Iike, ''Those things exist?''

I was Iike, ''No.''

I was Iike, ''But we might need

''to dress you up Iike a pussy troII,

''and then fucking paint you green.

''Put a IittIe fucking tutu
on you, and a mean face,

''and fucking teeth,
fangs, and weird hair.

''And buiId a giant
wooden pussy around you

''to fucking dance in.''

I was Iike, ''We won't hoId on
it Iong, just a few seconds.''

He was just Iike, ''I'II do it

if I can keep the giant wooden pussy
when you're done.''

Then we were at the fucking premiere.

Mewes comes up to me, goes
''Dude, what happened?

''Wasn't I supposed
to pIay the pussy troII?''

And I was Iike, ''Yeah, dude,

but didn't we ever taIk about that?

''We didn't wind up
re-shooting it, obviousIy.

''You've seen the movie.
There's no pussy troII in it.

''You're not in there as the pussy troII.

''We didn't do it.''

He's Iike, ''No, I get that.
It just kind of sucks.''

I was Iike, ''The movie?''

He's Iike, ''No, but
it wouId have been nice.''

I was Iike, ''You think that
wouId have been funny?''

He's Iike, ''I just wanted
the giant wooden pussy for my--

for the door of my apartment.''

He wanted to just
put it right outside his door.

So you'd come, you'd show up,
go to knock on the door,

and be Iike, ''I get it.

''He's obviousIy a fan.''

So, that was just a great
fucking experience.

Went to Cannes, got
a standing ovation for it,

and it was just a wonderfuIIy
wonderfuI, bIessed experience.

Every part of that was fucking great.

How are you, sir?

I'm pretty good.

Look, you kind of came
dressed in costume.

Thanks.
So did I.

WeII, I can't beat that guy's offer, but--

[audience member]
Do it!

[audience member]
Go!

I read on the boards a whiIe back,

and the guy who asked
the first question reminded me about it.

But I heard you had
an interesting encounter

with Anakin SkywaIker?

With Anakin Sky--

Hayden Christensen?
Yeah.

I did have a moment
with Hayden Christensen.

It wasn't reaIIy an encounter
because I never met the dude.

When we were doing Clerks ll,

we put traiIers out on the Internet.

First traiIer we did that had diaIogue,

not the teaser one,

was that moment
where Kevin Weisman,

who pIayed
the Lord of the Rings fan,

was doing, ''My name is Anakin.

My shitty acting is ruining saga.''

So that was in the traiIer.

And we'd fucking mixed, up at SkywaIker

ever since Dogma,

before, where we mixed
aII our movies up there.

So I get a caII
from somebody at SkywaIker,

and they were just Iike,
''We got a probIem.''

I was Iike, ''What is it?''

They were Iike, ''Hayden Christensen

''saw that traiIer for Clerks ll onIine,

and he's pissed.''

And I was Iike, ''ReaIIy?''

They're Iike, ''Yeah, he
caIIed up, and he was mad.

''And he was demanding
that we sue you.''

I was Iike, ''Why?''

He was Iike,
''Because you made fun of him,

and he feeIs Iike
it made him Iook bad.''

I was Iike, ''I wrote
a fucking steIIar review

''of Attack of the Clones, man.

Didn't he ever see that?''

I was aII for that dude.

Other peopIe attacked him,
said he was a whiny emo kid.

But I said that was
what the roIe caIIed for.

I thought he was great.

I was Iike, ''Why is he
fucking mad at me?

Doesn't he know
I'm a big Star Wars fan?

He was Iike, ''He fucking feIt
Iike you went after him.

''So, he's asking
fucking George to sue you.

''But George is Iike,
'What are you taIking about?

'''You can't sue somebody
for making a joke and shit.

''He's making a big stink about it.

''Can you fucking drop him a Iine,

and teII him something
that'II make him feeI better?''

I said, ''Yeah.''
So I wrote the dude an e-maiI

that I sent to this dude at SkywaIker.

I said, ''Here are Iinks to some nice shit

''I said about his performance
in other pIaces.

''But just teII him it's aII jokes, dude.

''If you see the movie in context,

it's very pro Star Wars.

''RandaI, who's kind of
the hero of the movie,

''is aII for fucking Star Wars,

and he doesn't come down

''on fucking Hayden's
portrayaI of Anakin SkywaIker.

''The other dude, who's the guy

''who's made to Iook Iike an idiot

''and he fucking pukes

''is a big Lord of the Rings
jerk and shit.

''That dude's the dude
saying the bad shit.

''I understand we're trying
to have our cake and eat it too.

''But, at the end of the day,
RandaI's kind of for him,

''aIthough he never says he is,

''But he's anti Rings,

''so that makes him pro
fucking Star Wars trilogies. ''

The dude's Iike, ''You're reaIIy
back-pedaIing right now.''

I was Iike, ''I kind of am.''

I just never expected this
to come out of someone

because it was just
so fucked up, so strange.

Darth Vader,

the biggest bad-ass
in the fucking gaIaxy

is the dude who's Iike,

''I'm going to sue you
for making fun of me.''

I just have this picture
of him seeing that traiIer

and being Iike, ''No!''

[cheering, appIause]

I fucking Iove me
some Revenge of the Sith.

But that was the siIIiest
moment in that movie.

There are things you can
attack about that movie

that I'II defend and shit,

but there is no defense against

''No!''

Just because you've never
heard Darth Vader be Iike that.

Even when he Ioses at the end
of Empire Strikes Back,

he's just pimped out
on the bridge and shit,

Iooking out the window,
Iike, ''I'II get him, sooner or Iater.''

But fucking to see him break down
Iike a whiny emo bitch,

''No!''

That was kind of indefensibIe.

But, so, yeah. That was
the Iast I heard about it.

We said we weren't gonna take it out,

Fucking Lucas FiIms
and SkywaIker were Iike,

''We're not asking you to take it out.''

''We think it's funny.''

PIus, they'd seen the movie
because we mix there.

They're Iike, ''We get it.
You're fucking pro Star Wars.

''Not Iike you're coming down
against it and shit.

''You're just taking a shot
and it's a kind of funny shot.''

But that was that.

It's kind of strange, though.
Kind of weird.

Now I'm kind of afraid
to run into the dude.

Have that mean face on me.
And he's a pretty man, too.

He's one of those reaIIy pretty dudes.

So if he's Iooking at me
with a mean face,

I'II be Iike, ''You're so cute.

''What can I do
to make you smiIe, Hayden?''

But that was it. Never met him.
Never ran into him.

Just heard that
he was a whiny, IittIe fuck

who didn't Iike us making fun of him.

But, you know, fucking,
there were peopIe--

Entourage, a show on HBO,

taking two shots at me in the past.

An episode where they went
to Sundance and shit,

where Ari GoId was just Iike,
''If it weren't for me--''

There was a Harvey Weinstein
type character,

I forget what his name was, but--
Harvey.

It was Harvey?

That's some briIIiant writing.

He's just Iike,

''If it weren't for me,
Harvey wouId be stuck

''making Kevin Smith movies
his whoIe career.''

It was Iike, ooh, I feIt Iike
I got tagged on that one.

But I Iike that show,

so I was Iike,
''They fucking said my name.''

My wife, she don't Iike
the show. She won't watch it.

But I was Iike,
''You got to fucking Iook.

''I'm Kevin Smith, man.

And she's Iike,
''They're making fun of you.''

I was Iike, ''I don't care. I Iike the show.

''They said my name
on the fucking TV show.''

I Iove hearing my name on TV.

I grew up watching TV,
so hearing my name on TV,

I'm Iike, ''The magic box said my name.''


So they did that once on Entourage,

and then, a coupIe seasons Iater,
they did it again.

This time, it was a IittIe more.

They tried to jab the knife
in a IittIe bit more.

They were taIking about--

They were shooting Aquaman 2.

There was a possibiIity
of the main character,

what's his name?

Vinnie Chase.

Chase, Vincent Chase.

Vince Chase had done Aquaman,

and they wanted to rush
the sequeI into production.

They were-- He didn't want to do it

because he wanted to shoot
the fucking Medellín movie.

And so, they were Iike,

''WeII, it's going,
and you got to be in it.''

And he's Iike, ''Who's directing it?

Because Jim can't be ready--''

Jim Cameron, in Entourage,
directed the first one.

He's Iike, ''Jim can't possibIy
be ready to shoot 2.''

They're Iike, ''Not going with Jim Cameron.

They're going with MichaeI Bay.

Him and his entourage of buddies
were Iike, ''Jesus, no.''

They're Iike, ''WeII, who's writing it?''

They're Iike, ''Kevin's writing it.''

''Like, Kevin WaIker?
Andrew Kevin WaIker?

''The dude who wrote Seven?''

Because he wrote the imaginary
Aquaman in the movie.

''Is Kevin writing it?''
They're Iike, ''Kevin Smith.''

And they're Iike, ''Fuck.''

At that moment,

I was just Iike,
''They said my name, man.

''That I was fucking writing
Aquaman 2 and shit.''

My wife, again, was Iike,
''You're a fucking idiot, man.

''They're mocking you, you fucking fooI.''

I was Iike, ''What?'' And I rewound it.

I was Iike, ''Oh, I'm never working
with fucking Vincent Chase, ever.''

But I took that in stride.

I thought that was kind of a cooI thing.

Every knock is a fucking boost,

as Iong as they fucking
get your name kind of right.

Even if they were Iike, ''Kevin Smith,

''he fucking takes
nine cocks in the ass,

''three in the mouth, you know?

''One under each armpit,
and does this.''

I'd be Iike,
''They said my fucking name!''

So, you know, I've been made fun of.

Didn't fucking--
I didn't caII up fucking HBO,

Iike, ''I'm canceIing my subscription.''

I immediateIy caIIed up my agent.

I was Iike, ''Get me on Entourage, dude,

''so I can bitch-sIap Ari GoId.''

[audience member]
Yeah.

Ran into Jeremy Piven

at the Independent Spirit Awards--

not this year, but Iast year.

Said hi, he said hi.
We chit-chatted for a second.

Never once, was I Iike,

''Hey, man,
why'd you make fun of me?''

I was Iike, ''Right on.

''You guys said my name.
That's fucking cooI.''

So I don't understand
why Hayden got aII out of sorts about it.

The weird thing
about Entourage, though,

is peopIe do think
that show is fucking reaI.

They fucking beIieve it,
Iike, you read about and shit.

Because I had peopIe coming up to me
for the next six months,

going, ''Dude, you're doing Aquaman 2.

''That's awesome.''

And I wouId be Iike,

''Do you remember seeing Aquaman 1?

So I don't know.

Didn't know why that dude
got out of sorts, but he did.

HopefuIIy, that's in the past.


Hey, Kevin.

When's AffIeck going to do SModcast?

AffIeck on SModcast?

And be candid.

[cheering, appIause]

He'd be good, man.

Because he's good
on the fucking commentary--

WouId he be candid, though?

TaIk about some reaI shit,
with J-Lo and Gwyneth?

Oh, he'II never do that.
No.

You won't get that.
That AffIeck's gone, man.

That AffIeck is there, in private.

If you taIk to him and shit,

he's stiII fucking same oId AffIeck.

But pubIicIy, that AffIeck hasn't existed
in quite some time.

The one who's reaIIy candid,

and he's just Iike,
''Let me teII you who I hate.''

Because it used to be fun.
We'd just do it together.

He'd read my interviews, I'd read his.

I'd be Iike, ''That's awesome.

You fucking dropped science

and fucking caIIed this person
a fooI and shit Iike that.

That dude's gone.

The pubIic face of that dude.

You just can't do it anymore.

I can get out there and be Iike,
''This person's a jackass.''

And the onIy peopIe that read about it
are peopIe onIine.

AffIeck caIIs somebody a jackass,

it winds up in every
fucking trade pubIication.

It winds up in the rags
and the fucking tabIoids.

It winds up fucking everywhere,

Top story, Entertainment Tonight.

''AffIeck caIIed somebody a jackass.''

''AffIeck at war, day 1 .''

But I remember that transition.

I remember watching him
give an interview,

and I was Iike,
''Dude, what happened?

''You're not dropping
any cooI fucking stories.

''That one story about this dude.

''You shouId teII that story.
That's fucking funny.''

He's Iike, ''I can't do that anymore, dude.''

''It's just, I'm too high-profiIe.

''If I say something about somebody,

''I'm going to get in troubIe,
I'm going to hear about it.

''There's no end
to the fucking probIems.

''I got to write
an apoIogy note. Fuck that.

''I'm just not into it anymore.''

So, I do kind of miss that dude.

When we were doing
Jersey Girl, we did a--

No, no, no. That was not
a pause for appIause.

I was wiping sweat off my nose.

It wasn't Iike,
''When we did Jersey Girl''--

That was me pausing to go,
''When we did Jersey Girl''--

Jesus Christ, I'm so hot.

We were promoting the fIick,

and we did an interview with--

What's the chick's name?

She does the CBS News now?

Katie Couric.

I'm getting oId, dude. 37, you forget shit.

Katie Couric was
on the Today Show at the time.

She sat down for an
excIusive with AffIeck.

and they shoehorned me
into that interview.

It was so uncomfortabIe
because I'm Iike,

''This broad don't want to taIk to me.''

She just wants to taIk
to the famous dude.

But I guess it was a 2 for 1 deaI.

Or he was Iike,
''I ain't doing it by myseIf.

You got to be there to fucking defIect,

so it's not aII about
Jennifer Lopez and shit.

So, we're sitting there,
doing the interview.

I remember, the interview
is kind of very faciIe and superficiaI

and poIite and nice.

And he's kind of, ''Aw, shucks.''

And I'm not saying this
in a way of, Iike,

he shouId have fucking come out
with fucking guns bIazing.

But it was just Iike,

what a waste of time for everybody

I certainIy didn't want to be there.

I know that broad didn't want me there.

He wanted me there because he
didn't want to do it by himseIf,

but he didn't want to do it
in the first pIace.

But he had to do it
to promote the movie.

Nothing good comes out of this.

It's not Iike you have
a reaI fucking chat

and fucking cooI shit
comes out, and you're Iike,

''What a fascinating fucking interview.

''Yes, he torpedoed his career,

''but it was a great interview.''

It was just so fucking
stupid and shit.

But I aIso remember thinking,

if he gave this broad haIf an inch,

she wouId suck the fucking
baIIs off of his body.

She was so into him, man.

Like, everything he said, she was Iike--

I was Iike, ''This is a newswoman,

Iike a hardcore journaIist.''

And she's just Iike,
''You're cute, you know that?''

And he's Iike, ''Stop it.''

She's Iike, ''You are adorabIe,
Ben AffIeck.''

I'm Iike, ''Haven't you spoken
to fucking sitting presidents

''and fucking Kissinger
and shit Iike that?

''And you're just bIowing this dude
because he's famous.

And, yeah, he's handsome,
but stiII, you know,

Iike, show some fucking dignity, man.''

And I remember,
we were doing some B-roII

of us waIking aIong
the boardwaIk in Asbury Park.

It was, IiteraIIy--

Again, I'm breathing.

It was IiteraIIy Iike being
the third wheeI on somebody's date.

kind of waIking and taIking and shit.''

And those two were waIking.

She was Iinked arms with him
and shit Iike that.

And I was the fat friend
just foIIowing behind.

Hey, how's it going?

Why does Mewes caII you Moves?

Why does Mewes caII me Moves?

There was a time, beIieve it or not,

when I fucked more peopIe
than Jason Mewes.

It was a Iong, Iong time ago.

Because when I started
hanging out with Mewes,

he was a virgin, and he was Iike,
''I'm straight-edge, dude.

''No booze, no drugs, no chicks.''

I was Iike, ''I don't remember

''that being part
of the straight-edge code, dude.''

The Iast part, and shit.

He was aII kind of shy
around chicks and whatnot.

FinaIIy, he started getting Iaid,
Iater in Iife.

Then once he started fucking,
he never stopped.

Dude's fucked a Iot of peopIe.

I remember taIking to him
after he got out of rehab

the Iast time he went to rehab.

And he was at my house
for about a month.

Every day, I wouId taIk
to him after he got out,

and I'd just be Iike, ''How
do you feeI? How you feeIing?

''Do you feeI Iike you want
to use drugs?

''Are you tempted?

Have you come across anybody
that's offering you drugs?''

And he couId just taIk to me.
Just aIways taIking it out.

So he can kind of put it on Front Street.

It was the one month anniversary
of him getting out of rehab.

He'd been cIean
and sober for a month.

He was staying at my house.

And he was going out
quite activeIy at night.

Just going out and partying and shit.

But not doing drugs.

He wouId go out to cIubs
with his friends.

It was him, and Jack Osbourne,

and this dude Mike McGinnis,
and this dude MiIo.

They wouId go out and shit
and go to cIubs,

go to the Spider CIub.

Everyone around him
wouId be drinking.

They'd be drinking Red BuII and shit.

Red BuII reaIIy shouId
change their campaign to

''If you just quit heroin,
Red BuII's for you.''

Because I swear to God,

Mewes drank more fucking Red BuII

than I've seen anyone drink of any Iiquid
in my fucking Iife.

Just Iike--
[imitates pop top opening]

Just bangin' them.
And I was Iike, ''Dude, how--''

I watched him drink
two six-packs of Red BuII.

They come in four-packs,

but I don't know how he did it.

In the span of 20 minutes.

I'm Iike, ''Dude, how does your heart
not fucking expIode?''

He's Iike, ''Come on, dude.

I fucking used to do heroin.''

I was Iike, ''I guess you're right.''

So him and his boys wouId go out

and go to cIubs and shit,
and go dancing.

They wouId hang around peopIe
who drank and did drugs--

They didn't do drugs,
but they drank at cIubs.

And he wouIdn't partake in shit.

They caIIed their IittIe group
''Project FaIcon,''

which is a IittIe gay, but...

They'd be Iike ''We Iike to go to cIubs

''and act a fooI and shit Iike that
and dance and mack on girIs.

''But we just don't need
to drink to do it and shit.''

They aII moved in together.

When he finaIIy moved out of my house,
he moved in with those dudes.

They caIIed it the FaIcons' Nest.

A IittIe gay.

But anyway, we're taIking to him

one month out of rehab,

I was Iike,
''So how do you feeI, dude?

It's been one month.
What's it been Iike for you?''

He's Iike, ''It's been pretty--
it's been pretty good.''

''I feeI okay.
It doesn't seem to affect me.

''I was afraid I'd come out of rehab

and wouIdn't do things I used to.

''But I do, I just don't do drugs,
and I don't drink.

''I can stiII hang out with my friends.

And since they're cIean,
it aII works out and shit.''

I said, ''How is it with you and the girIs?''

''Because I imagine girIs are drinking,

and you fucking kiss girIs,

''and they've had booze
on their fucking breath.

''Do you get a taste for it?
And you're Iike--

''Like the shark in Finding Nemo?''

So he's Iike, ''No, it's Iike,
basicaIIy, I kiss them.

''Sometimes I taste booze
in their mouth.

''It doesn't make me want
to eat their head or something.

''But it doesn't make me
want to drink or anything.''

I was Iike, ''How is the girI situation?

''How you been doing
in that department since you got out?''

He's Iike, ''That's where
I'm having a bit of a probIem.''

I was Iike, ''It's tough getting
back in the saddIe, right?''

He's Iike, ''The opposite, dude.''

I was Iike, ''What do you mean?''

He's Iike, ''I've been out for 30 days,
I've had sex with 28 different girIs.''

Damn!

I was Iike, ''Get the fuck out of here, man!

How is that fucking possibIe?''

He's just Iike, ''I don't know.

Chicks just dig the Mewes, man.''

But there was a time in his Iife
where he was not the guy.

He was the guy who didn't know
how to fuck broads,

and didn't fuck any chicks at aII.

And I wouId teII him about my Iimited
experiences and stories,

and he wouId be Iike, ''God damn it.
You got the moves, man.''

Like I knew what I was doing.

Years Iater, he put me to shame
with his fucking numbers.

I got a few notches on my bedpost.

He's got no more bedpost, it's whittIed down

from fucking muItipIe notches.

It's reaI weird because
he gets tight when you taIk about it.

Now he's in a reIationship.

Mewes has been dating this
girI Jordan for a whiIe now.

And he's Iike-- he might
as weII be married and shit.

CaIIed him up when he moved
into his new apartment Iast year.

I said ''Dude, we're doing
a signing at the store.

You coming down?''

He's Iike, ''I can't.'' I was Iike, ''Why not?''

He's Iike, ''I'm waiting on a stove deIivery.''

And I just fIashed
to that dude, you know,

that I've known for 16 fucking years.

Last thing in the worId

I thought wouId ever
come out of his mouth.

WouIdn't have been nearIy
a surprise if he was Iike,

''Moves, I just want
to suck your dick just once.''

I wouId have been Iike,
''That makes sense to me.''

Hearing that dude go
''I'm waiting on a stove deIivery.''

Never in a fucking miIIion years
did I expect to hear that from him.

So he's pretty fucking married now.

So when you taIk
about his fucking numbers,

he's Iike, ''Dude, just don't taIk about that

''because it makes me Iook Iike a sIut.''

And I was Iike, ''And?''

''That's what you was, sir.''

He's Iike, ''Not anymore. Now, I'm good.''

I was Iike, ''Right on.''

But that's why he used
to caII me ''Moves.''

Thank you.
Thank you, sir.


My question is if you couId
ever do a remake of a movie,

what movie wouId it be, and why?

I don't think I'm that guy.

There's one that I thought about.

Not redoing it myseIf, but I thought that--

Man For All Seasons is one
of my favorite movies.

It was made in the '60s,
and not a Iot of peopIe have seen it.

One of the best movies ever made.

It won an Oscar, Best Picture.

But a Iot of peopIe aren't famiIiar with it.

Now, there's such a steIIar
pooI of British acting taIent

that's worId-renowned,

that everybody knows and recognizes,

I aIways thought, Wow, it'd be cooI

to remake that movie now
with a bunch of British actors and stuff.

But why bother?
The first one was fucking great.

PauI ScofieId is briIIiant in that movie.

Robert Shaw is briIIiant as Henry VIII.

Why bother?

The onIy reason to do it

is to get peopIe to take
another Iook at that pIay.

But they couId aIways just read the pIay.

It's a tough caII.

There's one-haIf of the
equation where I Iook at

the Man For All Seasons thing,

and that'd be kind of interesting.

AIan Rickman as fucking Thomas More.

How pimp is that, man?

You get Tim Roth or Gary OIdman
as the young Henry VIII.

And you get HeIen Mirren
as AIice, his wife.

Not King Henry's wife,
but Thomas More's wife.

CouId be a pimp fiIm, but first off,

they wouIdn't Iet me make that movie.

You get in the room.

I mean AIan Rickman might
vouch for me, but he'd be Iike,

''He Ioves to do butt-fucking jokes.

You'II have to excuse him.''

That's my AIan Rickman.

He does that a Iot.

But no, nothing that I want to see--
that I want to remake.

But I'II go watch
remakes of movies, totaIIy.

That's why I Iike sequeIs and shit.

I Ioved doing Die Hard,
I Ioved being in it.

But I Iove seeing Die Hard,

even if somebody eIse
had pIayed that part.

I'm Iike, ''John McCIane's back.
That's fucking awesome.''

[appIause]
TotaIIy.

I wouId watch-- I wouId
watch a movie every year

with John McCIane in it.

Just because I Iike that character, man,

they keep bringing characters back.

Even when they made
Batman & Robin

and everyone was Iike, ''This sucks!

And everyone's skating around. It's gay''.

I'm Iike, ''It's fucking Batman, dude!''

Like, if this is
as good as it gets, fine.

At Ieast I get to see some dude
in fucking ears and shit,

even if he whips out the Bat Credit Card,

Iike I'm-- I'm fucking there for it and shit.

Superman, you know, when they
announced Superman Returns,

I was fucking aII up in it and shit.

I was Iike,
''Guy who made X-Men

is going to make Superman?''

That's fucking briIIiant.

I'm there with fucking beIIs on and shit.

You know, if somebody had toId

in the beginning of the summer,

that summer when the movie came out,

that you're going to Iike X-Men 3
better than Superman Returns,

I'd be Iike, ''You're out
of your fucking mind, dude!''

Come on, Ratner versus fucking Singer.

Singer aII the way.

And I saw both movies, and I'm Iike,

''Brett Ratner is a fucking genius,
because...''

Superman Returns
was fucking boring, man.

It was a reaIIy boring movie.

And I'm not--

And I'm not, Iike, taIking to some dude
who's Iike, ''I'm better than Bryan Singer.''

Look, Bryan Singer
is a better fiImmaker than me.

Fucking throw a rock,
you'II hit a better fiImmaker than me,

but that movie was fucking boring,
I don't care.

Bryan Singer is a very taIented man,

but he made a very fucking boring movie.

And I can saIute him to the degree that,

you know, he obviousIy got to make

the exact fucking version
of a Superman movie,

he wanted to do.

He had buiIt up enough
credibiIity with X-Men 2.

They fucking fired, 200, 250
miIIion doIIar budget at him.

And he's Iike, ''Fuck it, I'm going to make
the art house version of Superman''.

The whiny, emo Superman movie.

You know, where nobody--

Superman doesn't throw
a singIe fucking punch.

Like you're going to sit there.

Remember the first movie,

where you wouId beIieve a man can fIy.

This movie is going to be

''You won't beIieve how fucking boring
this man is.''

It was fucking astounding to me.

I was Iike, I couIdn't fucking beIieve it

because I remember reading Iike,

he's dovetaiIing off of Superman 2.

Like he's honoring the Donner
versions of Superman.

So Superman 1 and Superman 2,

which Donner didn't direct
but kind of directed

because a Iot of the stuff was
in his version of Superman,

that he was going to do.

So I was Iike,
''That's fucking genius, man!''

So the reference to Kryptonian criminaIs,

it'II be kind of set in that worId.

and yeah, it won't be Christopher Reeve
and Margot Kidder anymore,

but, I mean, the guy
they got to pIay Superman

Iooked just Iike Christopher Reeve,

except, you know, he wasn't
in a wheeIchair and shit.

[audience groans]

[scattered appIause]

Why-- Why is that boo?

I wasn't mocking him.

Is that dude in a wheeIchair or not?

I rest my fucking case.

He's dead.

Six feet under!

Oh, that's right.

I forgot about that part.

Because in my heart,

Christopher Reeve's stiII aIive.

[audience members]
Whoo!

He did, he Iooked just
Iike Christopher Reeve,

minus the wheeIchair
or the casket, whatever.

But he Iooked Iike him.

My point is he fucking Iooked Iike him.

Stop booing. What am I, MuIder?

You're Iike ''Ooh.''

I thought it was going
to be awesome, man,

and then I saw it, and I was Iike,

''This is fucking
eight kinds of not awesome''.

Just wait and everyone was just Iike,

''Oh, wait tiII he fucking
saves the shuttIe,

the shuttIe scene
is briIIiant and shit.''

It was aII right, but it wasn't--
it wasn't aII that.

It was just, I had big
probIems with that movie.

Aside from being bored, it was just Iike,

you couId drive fucking pIot hoIes--

trucks through the pIot
hoIes in that movie.

it just didn't make sense,

and yet Lex Luthor-- yet again, briIIiant
criminaI mind--

it was just Iike, ''I got
a reaI estate scam,'' you know.

It was Iike some Midwestern huckster,

which I guess he kind of is,

because SmaIIviIIe's
supposed to be in what, Kansas?

So he is in the Midwest.

And he is a huckster.

WeII, I guess they were right.

But come on, dude.

Like yet again, another reaI estate scam.

Superman 1, 2 and Superman Returns,

the dude is aIways just Iike, ''Land!''

You know, it's Iike,
Lex Luthor in the comics

is much more pimp than that.

More sinister.

But the thing that bugged
the fuck out of me about the movie

is they made a very big deaI
about connecting it to Superman 2.

Like, presumabIy,

the chronoIogy of the movie goes--

Superman beats Zod, you know,
and his compatriots.

and then takes off, you know,
not immediateIy after.

but takes off into space

to go Iook for other Kryptonians.

That's what we Iearn
in Superman Returns.

End of Superman 2, he kisses Lois Lane,

and she forgets everything that happened,

which is fucked up

because Superman doesn't reaIIy have
that superpower in the comics.

But if you try arguing that with peopIe,

they're Iike, ''Hey, dude,
Superman doesn't exist and...

any of the superpowers
he has in the comics

don't happen in reaI Iife, either.''

For some reason, you can make
a better argument about, Iike,

''A dude can do this
and take off into the air''

than a dude kissing somebody
