MAN: <i>There is a saying,</i>

<i>"Believe none of what you hear</i>
<i>and only half of what you see. "</i>

<i>Good advice. People will try</i>
<i>and convince you of anything.</i>

Anything can be the start
of a conversation, "Excuse me,

do you have the time?"
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

Well, you laugh.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

Hotels are a great hunting ground.

People are away from home,
they're ready to chit-chat.

<i>Get their ear. Give 'em a sob story.</i>
<i>Then hit 'em with a worst-case scenario.</i>

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

...all over the place.

That's the old guy, though.
Man, he's not lookin' good.

He's got this big incontinent problem.

I had dogs that were living forever.
It's like breakin' my heart.

I gotta, you know... It's just...
Yeah, it's sad.

He was such a good dog for so long.
And some ketchup, please.

Great dog.
Oh, yeah.

He's the best bird dog
I think I ever had.

Excuse me, do you happen
to have the time?

Yeah, 8:45.
Forty-five. You guys here on vacation?

Yeah, we're up for pheasant season.
Oh.

Trying to figure out whether to blow
the day at the Potawatomi Museum

or the indoor water park?
Neither.


I'm not much of a hunter myself.
I got a friend who is... was.

Buddy went shootin' quail and
accidentally hit him squarely in the face.

Took his whole left cheek right off.

Of course, he ended up suing the guy
for $1.2 million.

Poor fellow lost his house, his car.
Last I heard he was

out in the woods somewhere,
living in a cardboard box.

All because of an accident.

That's a guy who could of used
a little liability coverage.

Hey. Congrats on the award.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Whatever. It means zip.

What I'd really like is Phil Peters'
award out there. Look at him.

That guy tops a million dollars in sales

'cause he's got the half dozen people
bird-doggin' for him.

So? It's an off year.
You'll bounce back.

Yeah. Just wanna make it
to Aruba, you know?

Yeah, well, I saw the brochure.
Wow. They're goin' all out for the 50th.

That's where you wanna make it.

I mean, none of this rinky-dink
Wisconsin crap, you know?

Let's go.
Oh. Gotta go.

Yeah.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

Well, you folks have a safe trip.
Thanks.

Careful on those icy roads.

Hey. You have change
for a vending machine for a 50?

Stay away from the corn nuts.
I know a guy who broke his jaw on one.


You here on vacation?
Yeah.

I'm Bob Egan,
I was at your seminar today.

God, this is a thrill for me.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

You were at the convention.
Yeah. Uh...

It's great to meet you.

Too bad. You let him get away.

Oh, no, no. He's a colleague of mine.
I'll give it to him later.

Oh. Well, if you're not
seein' him till later,

how about puttin' it
to good use right now?

I just lost 40 bucks in the slots.

I could use some more cheerin' up.

(WOMAN GIGGLING)
(INDISTINCT DIALOGUE)

OK. All right.
No, no, no. Here, here.

I think.
OK, how much farther is it?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Oh, hey. Hi.

Uh... This is, uh... Sherri.

He's a winner! (LAUGHS)
She's...

She's, uh...
interested in insurance, so...


I'm just gonna help her walk it off.


All right, here's the bathroom.

Ooh! A suite.
Yeah.

Fancy.

Ooh! (GIGGLES)

See? You are a winner.
Yeah.

Mini bar.
Oh...

No. They charge you an arm and a leg
for that. Don't open it.

All right.
I got an early morning meeting.

OK? I think you mentioned you had a
friend who could come and pick you up?


No, no, no, no. Listen...

I'm sor... I gotta call it a night.

One for the road, OK? Come on.

Oh... (COUGHS)
(GIGGLES)

All right, time to go. That's it.

OK. Ooh! (LAUGHS)

All right.

Come on, this isn't a good idea.
I'm tellin' ya. It's...

Huh?
Huh? (GIGGLES)


Oh, God.

Oh, shit.

Didn't realize you had
a security problem here.

Good thing you got
my credit card on file.

I had my wallet stolen
from my room last night.

Sorry, sir.
I'll just get the manager for you.

Maybe your homeowners will cover it.

Jesus Christ. $4.50 for a Diet Coke.
I feel like I've been robbed twice.

Yeah, I know. Money's been burnin'
a hole in my pocket, too.

I'm lucky, though. My trip paid off.
I got a job offer.

Which is great because I've been
hopin' to move back

so my wife can be closer to her parents.

Mr. Prohaska.
Yeah.

You're in luck.
We found your wallet in the casino.

Oh, I see she preferred paper
to plastic.

Great, thanks.
She?

Well, I'm assumin'
it's one of the maids that works here.

Nice of her to clean out my wallet,
as well.

Hey, look. I still got a few twenties.
Um...

Here, uh, take that for your trip.

And I'll just give you my card

and you can just mail it back to me
whenever you get a chance.

Yeah. Well, thanks, Bob Egan.

Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.

Oh, look.
Better say goodbye to my new boss.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

So you're gonna be working
with Phil Peters, huh?

Oh, hey. Yeah, yeah.

I'm actually in the market
for a new hire myself.

Oh, really, you are? You sounded like
you had a pretty thriving business

going in there. I'm surprised...

I got about a half dozen agents working
for me. Some of the best in the state.

We've had a hell of a year.
Yeah. Well...

Where'd you say your in-laws live again?

Racine.
Racine?

Yeah, that's up near my territory.

Mind me askin' how much
he's offering ya?

Uh, well, it's a 70-30 split to start
until I get my state license, which, uh,

I feel like it's a pretty good deal
because I'm the new guy in the office.

You're lettin' him take that much?
I think I could beat his rate by...

...I don't know, five percent.

Five percent?
Yep.

Sounds like a good deal.
Yeah.

OK. OK.
OK.

All right. Terrific, I will do that.
Thanks, Mickey.

I brought you in
some more liability forms.

Happy to keep sending 'em in under
my name until you're licensed.

God, thank you. That is terrific.

I gotta find out
when the next exam is.

Take your time, study up. My secretary
says it's gotten a lot tougher.

She's been taking classes
just to prepare.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Is she gonna start selling for ya?

Karla? I don't know about that.

Be better at the knicky-knack
little details.

Following up on paperwork and so forth.
Female brain.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

You know, I should just
come by the office next time.

I mean, I'd love to meet everybody.
Our sales guys are barely in.

This is the new office. We do
most of our sales by the telephone

and the rest of the time
we're out networking. In fact,

you should think about
joining some clubs.

(BOB SHUDDERING)

Can't get used to this weather.
You never get used to it, Bob, ever.

There's two seasons here,
winter and road works.

Hey, that's a nice car.
It's pretty easy to spot.

Yeah, my initials.
Some son of a bitch got there first.

Look at all this.
Hey, I wanted to tell you,

I stopped by and saw that trucker,
off route 45.

I hope he made the long drive
worth it for ya.

Oh, yeah, yeah. He's a super nice guy,
but we actually found out

that he could do better with an outfit
he already trucks for.

There's nothing wrong with a little
information management, Bob.

Well, truth of it,
he didn't have that much to spend.

But he did introduce me
to a neighbor of his

who's looking for
a full homeowners package.

He's a sweet old man. He's a retired
farmer. I'm actually going out there...

Be careful of seniors.
They'll keep you out there all day

just to have somebody to talk to.
No, no. He's pretty interested.

He's just wavering
on the amount of coverage.

I mean, we don't wanna
have him over-insured.

There's no such thing.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

(MICKEY, INDISTINCT)... Bob.

Maybe he forgot, he's older.

I don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

I'll come back next week.

Hey, it was really nice of you, though,
to come out, help me try to close.

Crappy job shoveling.
This is an accident waitin' to happen.

You should stress that in your sales
pitch, scare him a little bit, you know?

Bob? Nice to see you.
(CHUCKLES) Hey, Frank.

Mickey, this is Frank Richie.

This is the guy that asked me about
the truck insurance.

Oh! Oh, Mickey Prohaska. Hi.

Nice to meet you.
Yeah, yeah.

Say, Bob, thanks for your help.

You saved me a good 200 bucks.
You fellas here to meet with Gorvy?

Yeah, yeah,
but he doesn't seem to be in.

Oh, come on in. Maybe he's asleep.

(PHONE DISCONNECT
ALERT BEEPING)

He must be outside with his dog.

It's chilly here.
Yeah, he keeps the temperature low.

Doesn't like to waste.

I can see that.
Oh, some of these things are his sister's.

I brought 'em down after she went
into the nursing home.

I told him I'd find out if any of it
was worth anything.

I did some truckin' for an auctioneer.

He told me a guy once paid
a hundred grand for a rug.

(BOB WHISTLES)
Anything can happen, right?

(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)
This rug might be worth a small fortune.

Well, this is not workin'
the way they promised.

I was hopin' more uranium or gold.
I find two quarters and a railroad spike.


Gorvy, I tried to call you.

You gotta remember,
hang your phone up.

Oh, yeah. Hello, hello.

Do I know these people?
(BOB CHUCKLES)

I'm Bob Egan. I met you the other day.
Nice to meet you.

Mickey Prohaska. Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

Want to come in?
I could make some coffee.

I can't stay. Did you get a chance
to take those pictures?

Well, I took pictures of Petey.

No. I meant the pictures
for the auctioneer.

I'm doin' a run for him this week.
(YAPPING)

Yeah, I was upstairs. I took everything
down so I could see them.

It was too dark up there.
Here, look what I found.

Snow shoes.
I've always wanted to try those.

Well, take them.
I got no use for them no more.

I'll let you folks do your business.
Listen to 'em, Gorvy.

OK.
They're here to help ya. Bye, guys.

Bye.
Well, we might as well sit down.

What do I need insurance for?

Well, for one thing,
to protect your valuables.

I don't got no valuables,
except for Petey.

Do you sell dog insurance?
No, but we do protect property.

And we insure with liability coverage.

Have you ever thought what might
happen out there on your front porch

if somebody were to slip and get hurt?

Well, nobody comes here much except
Frank and he wears those big boots,

you know, with cleats. So he's OK.

What about the mailman?

If, for instance,
your dog there were to bite him?

He could sue you for a lot of money.

No. He's a nice guy.
He wouldn't sue nobody.

Well, I got some peanut brittle.
Fresh made if ya like.

No, we should probably get going.
Yeah, I'm OK.

Thank you.
Yeah.

WOMAN: So I think that he's interested
in this one, but I'm not sure.

Can you deal
with the guy in the back there?

Thanks.


You can't keep letting
the mail pile up at our house.

Have you told anybody we're separated?

(VOICE LOW)
What am I supposed to say?

You've been outta the house
for two months.

I know. I really miss you.

This payin' for two places
is killing me financially.

I may have to take out
a second loan on the house.

If you need money so bad,
why don't you sell that car?

Don't be ridiculous, Jo Ann.

I can't show up to a sales call
drivin' a crappy car.

Yeah, well, you went behind my back!

We should've discussed it
like married people.

Discuss what? Don Schmidt gave me
a great trade-in on my car.

He's a policy holder.
So you bartered

with Shane's college fund?
No, he's 14 years old.

You have four years to pay it back.
(SCOFFS)

By all rights, if you wanna
be mad at somebody, be mad at Ed.

When's the last time that schmuck
paid child support?

Oh, please.
Hey. Whoa. Hey.

I'm not gonna...
Listen, look, look, look.

Look at this, huh?

Aruba. That's where
the convention is this year.

It's gonna be all warm and nice.
We could all get away again.

That'd be great, wouldn't it?

I gotta get to work.

(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)

MICKEY: Shit.

What'd the Nice Night Inn want?

They need a new credit card number.
The one they have for you is maxed.

We're out of coffee.

I asked you to get some more milk.

You know, I am capable of doing more
than just making coffee.

I could do anything.

Maybe this isn't the right job for me.
I gotta think about my future.

Karla, I got a plan for your future, OK?

I decided to make you
Chief Financial Officer.

You'll be handling all the bookkeeping
from now on. You can start with those.

Wait, these are personal.
All right?

Not the agency's.

I am the agency, Karla.
What about my raise?

Do you have any of that
Christmas candy I gave you?

Listen, we're gonna see if you can
handle more responsibility.

If you can, we're gonna do a salary
review at the end of the month, OK?

(PHONE RINGING)

Prohaska Agency.

Oh, you must mean Bob.

So, you decided to buy a policy?

Great.
That a sale?

I'll take that.

Where... where is the other guy?

He was unavailable.
What made you change your mind?

My TV's broken. You told me that
the insurance would take care of it.

Well, it doesn't exactly work that way.

Besides, you have to have a policy
in order to file a claim.

Yeah, well, that's why I called you
over here. I want to get a policy.

That's a very smart decision.
Yeah. So how much would this be?

Well, for your property here,
I'd recommend insuring it for $300,000.

For this little place?
$300,000 for this?

Nothing here is worth that much money.

You'd be very surprised.
It starts to add up.

Your friend, Frank, said that that rug
alone could be worth $100,000.

Get away!
Oh, yeah.

This rug right here?

For $100 a month, you can protect it,
along with all your other belongings.

I don't wanna scare you with this story,
but I know a guy who came home

from work one day and his house
was gone. Dust. Gas leak.

Last thing I heard he was livin'
out in the woods in a cardboard box.

livin' out in the woods.

Hm-hm. Hm-hm.
Not in this cold weather.

(SIGHS) Hundred dollars, you say?
Yep.

OK.

Here we go.

All right, it might be better for you
to put it in a check

so you have a copy for your records.

Oh, yeah. A check. Right.
Yeah.

OK, good.

You know, I don't have a personal one,
but I do have one from the business.

That'll work. Yeah.
Yeah?

OK, yeah. The Golden Harvest account.

They come every summer.
They plant the corn,

and I tell you...
(PETEY BARKS)

...I tell you
it's worth its weight in gold.

The corns... These days...
They use it for gasoline.

There you are and just right there.
Yeah.

OK.

OK.
Good. Go fix the TV now.

MAN ON TV: <i>They came straight at me,</i>
<i>so many surgeries, doctor visits, bills.</i>

<i>I'm so grateful for the attorneys</i>
<i>at Hersh and McClennon.</i>

<i>It won't cost you...</i>
OK. You're all set.

I got everything I need here.

I'll just let myself out.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Oh, I'm glad you're here, I've just...
I've been calling and calling,

the phone just kept ringing busy.
But, uh... Well, I'm Leonard Dahl

from Oscar Dahl and Sons.

The luthier. The violin maker.
(STAMMERS) Hm-hm.

Well...
The Polaroid that you sent me

was kinda blurry, but I could see
from the neck and the scroll work

that it's a promising instrument.
OK, you want the homeowner.

Just a sec. Gorvy? Mr. Hauer?

Is that it over there?
Gorvy?

You can't keep it by the door here,
it's very, very sensitive to temperature

and humidity.

(SNORING IN NEXT ROOM)

He's... He's asleep.

Hey, you're gonna have to come back.
All right? He's asleep.

No, I can't come back. I'm from Chicago.
I never get out here.

Sir.
How about a second here?

Wait a minute. Whoops.
(PLUCKS NOTES)

Gotta fix. Gotta fix.
(PLAYS OFF KEY NOTES)

OK.
(PLAYS CLASSICAL MUSIC)

It's got a really nice, mature tone.
Great.

And very good volume and projection.
Listen, I gotta go.

Well, wait a minute.
Could you hold that for me?

Just, I'm gonna... take a picture.

OK. Little higher.

Now, it's got a sound crack
and it's got some surface damage,

but I can match that. I'll be...
I'll be outta here in a second.

I can match the varnish perfectly.

I'm gonna be able to sell this thing,
perhaps.

I'm gonna have to make the repairs first
and my rates are very reasonable.

Oh, you're tryin' to squeeze
the homeowner for some money?

Nice sales pitch,
but you're barkin' up the wrong tree,

unless you wanna be paid in pennies.
Let's go.

Now, you can't...
you can't keep it there.

Well, you need to keep her away
from the mall. I'll tell you that.

(PHONE RINGING)

Because your premiums
are gonna skyrocket.

Yeah.
(MACHINE BEEPING)

GORVY ON MACHINE: <i>Hello?</i>
Well, I...

<i>Is anyone there?</i>
<i>Listen, my TV is not working again.</i>

<i>I think I need a new one</i>
<i>instead of this insurance.</i>

Can you hold on, John?
<i>Hello...</i>

Hello?

Yeah. Are you sure
it's not unplugged again?

No. No, you don't wanna cancel
your policy. It's not processed yet.

Yes. No, I can be out there...

Be out there in a half hour, OK?
Just sit tight.

Thank you, Mr. Hauer.

Bob.
Oh, hey.

How long have you been here?
I just got here.

Just here droppin' off
some of these auto policies,

and I wanted to meet Karla
so I brought her these.

Oh, yeah, yeah. You just missed her. She
had one of her insurance classes today.

Look at all these awards you've won.
Wow.

Well, we're all part of the operation.

Let me take... the policy?
Oh, yeah.

So where are you... where you headed?

Oh, one of my clients' wives
had another fender bender.

Hopefully your wife
doesn't drive a big wagon.

Oh, no, no.
Let me show you where the key is.

And the main door's open late.

Yeah, my wife
doesn't actually drive anymore.

She started having these seizures.

That's why we moved back there
to be with her parents.

Well, I'm glad that's workin' out.

MICKEY: I don't know.

The plugs look good.

Here's the problem. Past due.

Oh...

Gotta pay your bills, Gorvy.
Oh, God.

MICKEY: Wow.

Looks like you're really gonna
make some money on that violin.

I don't have no violin.

Real fire hazard in here, Gorvy.

All this stuff piled up.
Gotta get rid of some of this.

Look at this.
Can't just leave it...

Look at this, I do have a violin.

I didn't even know it.
It was staring me right in the face.

(PLUCKING STRINGS)
Not so good, but a violin.

Well, my stepson's really into music.

He might like this thing.
Pretty beat up.

Tell you what. I'll give you...

...twenty... I'll give you ten.
I'll give you $10 for it.

I'll tell you what.
If you take me to the bank

where I can deposit the money in
my money jar, I will give you the violin

for $10.
The bank's about to close.

We'll never make it.
Well, we'll do it Monday.

We do that, we come back here,
we watch some TV. We make a day of it.

It'll be safe here.

Good. OK. We do it.


Hi. I wrote you a check.

I wanna replace all the money
I took out of the account.

It's not just about the money, Mickey.
I know. I know it's not, I'm sorry.

I really screwed up.


Come on, Jo Ann, it's freezing out here.

Hm...
(GIGGLES)

Good to be back in my own bed.

Things are gonna be different this time.

Yeah. No more secrets.

I just want you to be honest.

Mickey, there's a check missing.

Oh, yeah. I moved some money
into Jo Ann and my joint account.

Well, how much?
$30,000.

What?
Well, that's almost the whole balance.

Price I had to pay
in order to get back into my house.

I'm not spendin' another dime on motels.

Mickey, you can't just take money
without telling me.

I'm in charge of finances now.
I'm gonna pay it all back.

I'm working on a very big deal, Karla.

GORVY: Wait till you see this.
This you've got to see.

Petey, come here!

This will make you laugh.
Petey, come here!

Come, Petey. Good boy. Good boy.

(PETEY WHINING)
Good boy. Look.

(STRUMMING OFF-NOTES)
(PETEY BARKS, HOWLS)

Yeah, more singing.

Come, sing.
(YAPPING)

(HOWLING)
(BARKING)

(GASPING, GROANING)

It's heavy.

Must be over a hundred dollars in there.

OK.


Here, save me a place in line.
I have to go to the bathroom.

If you get to the front,
ask for Bill Morton.

Tell him it's for the Golden Harvest
account. That's my farm.

No, Gorvy...

Oh...

Here, here. Let me help.
Let me help you with that.

Good doggy, too.

Thought you were comin' back in.

Well, I went across the street
to find a bathroom.

Then I met this nice man
with the nice doggy.

Oh.
Oh!

It's $122.41.
I knew there was more than $100.

And that includes the $10
I already gave ya.

What?
For the violin.

Oh. A man called me from Chicago,
he wants to buy the violin.

He even wrote me a letter about it.
No, no, no, no. We...

We have a deal. I'm takin' the violin.

What?
For my stepson.

We already talked about it,
he's all excited. I'm taking it.

I don't know. I have a fishing pole,
I can give him...

No! No, Gorvy, that's not the deal.
He doesn't want a fishing pole.

No, thanks.
Then what do I tell

the man from Chicago?

<i>He's coming all the way to see it.</i>

MAN: No, I'm really sorry,
but the Tononi's not for sale.

I was sure that I mentioned that.
I'm so sorry if I didn't.

No, it's... I have a buyer for it.

Could you just give me
the best number to call you at?

Is that... Yes, is that 7-7-3? Uh...

Yes, that's terrific.

Thank you very, very much.
I will get right back to you.

Thank you, bye-bye. Excuse me,
do you have an appointment?

I'm here about the violin you wanted.

Oh, you're the guy
from the farm in Wisconsin.

Yeah, Mickey Prohaska.
Right. Yeah.

Yeah, I'm representing the seller.
He's elderly, no condition to come here

and do business,
so he's asked me to handle the sale.

Well, as I said in my letter,
I'm prepared to offer $25,000.

I realize that. That's why I'm here.

I don't want you taking advantage
of an old man, with all due respect.

Some of these violins are worth
a lot more than that.

Oh, they certainly are,
and some of them are worth a lot less.

And the one you're representing
happens to be a very nice copy

of a Stainer. Yeah...

Jacobus Stainer's instruments
were copied

and reproduced all over Germany.

Right down to the handwritten signature
inside the body of the violin.

Uh-huh.
Uh...

You can show that to your client,
if you like.

Now, yours happens to have
an exceptional sound quality,

and it's also one of the better copies
I've come across.

Which is why the buyer's willing
to pay you $30,000 for it.

$30,000? What happened to 25?

I take a commission.

If you wanna have somebody else
handle the sale, be my guest.

I warn you, there's a lot
of corruption out there.

And why should I trust you?
This is a family-operated business.

We have survived for nearly a hundred
years because of our reputation

and the quality of our work.

You know, the guy I was talking to when
you came in, he will allow no one else

to even go near his instruments.

Is he the one who called
about the Stainer?

Stainer? No.

No, the buyer I have in mind
for your violin is a musician.

The other guy has one of the largest
privately owned string collections

in the world. No one knows exactly
what he's got or how he's got them.

There's a rumor going around
that the Davidoff Strad

is hidden away somewhere in his bedroom.
Supposedly, it was stolen

from some virtuoso's Manhattan...
Who exactly is this guy?

Uh, somebody who appreciates
my discretion.

Now, if you'd feel more comfortable,
I can have the photos I took

sent to a colleague
for a second opinion.

And I'd appreciate it if you didn't
sell it in the meantime

and I'm happy to give you
a ten percent deposit in good faith.

Uh...

What is the owner's name?

It's not easy for him
to get to the bank, he...

Uh... He prefers cash.

Shane!

Hey, Shane!

Shane, open the door!

I'd get out of here if I were you,
my mom's really pissed.

What?
Shane, get out the way.

What the hell is goin' on?

Maybe I should ask you
the same question.

Is there anything that you feel like
you need to tell me?

What are you talking about?
Um...

Anything happen at the convention
that's interesting? Like...

Did you meet a woman?
Oh, God. You've been...

You've been talkin'
to Judy Vandenhoevel.

She's... she's full of crap.

That woman she's talking about
happens to be a customer.

Um, the assistant manager
was kind enough to send us this.

And I don't even wanna think
about how your customer's earring

ended up in your hotel room.
(STAMMERS) That... She...

You know, nothing happened.
(SIGHING)

Come on, Jo Ann. I was robbed!

I want you gone.

I mean it this time.

(DOOR OPENING)

Oh, hey. Wow. You're here late.

I was just swingin' by to drop off some
of these policy forms for you to sign.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Thank you.

I actually, uh... you don't have to
drive all the way out here for these.

You can always just...
fake my signature,

and that way you can turn 'em in
to the home office yourself.

Oh, hey. I wanted to tell ya,

I had a terrific meeting with the
manager over at Jimmy's Wholesale.

And I bumped into Gorvy and Frank,
they were buying groceries.

You know, I didn't realize
that Gorvy had actually

gone ahead and bought himself a policy.

Oh, yeah. Just a small little package.

I'll let you know when the commission
comes in. It's nothing.

Oh, well, you know, I was just happy
he got himself some coverage.

You know, I was worried about him,
out there, all alone.

Yeah. He's not alone. He's got a dog.

God, that dog.
What am I gonna do about that dog?

You don't like him either?

Uh... His sister's sick, she had a stroke.

So he's gonna go out
to Rhinelander to visit her

and he doesn't know
what to do with the dog.

Oh, so the dog's gotta be sent away?

Well, I would take him,
but my wife's allergic.

And it seems that Frank's gotta go
on a big trip to Idaho.

So I don't know.
I got a client who's got a kennel.

I'll call him.
You would?


MICKEY: <i>Come on, Gorvy.</i>
<i>You're gonna miss your bus.</i>

They're gonna be waitin'
at the kennel for Pete.

I need my lozenges.

Yeah, you don't wanna forget those.
Yeah, yeah.

he doesn't want to leave the violin.

Hey, where are you goin' with that?
I'll hide it upstairs.

May I help you?

Yeah. I'm here to finish installing
the security system.

I brought the other keypad
the guy wanted.

No. No, I think you may have to
come back. We're actually just leaving.

No, no. It'll be fine.
It'll only take a second.

(THUDDING UPSTAIRS)
(TOOLS WHIRRING)

Gorvy? Why is there a guy down here
puttin' in an alarm system?

When'd you decide to do that?

I saw your friend, Bob,
at the supermarket the other day.

He said if I put in an alarm system
my rates would go down.

Why? Is he here?
MICKEY: Yes.

GORVY: Oh.

Alarm guy, will this go right through
to the police when it's hooked up?

Uh, yeah. It's connected
straight to the station.

I, um... I left my screwdriver somewhere
around here when I installed it...

Thanks for your help.
MAN: Yeah, I'll set my number

by the front door
in case you need it, OK?

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Did we put in the numbers?
Yeah.

And once you press in the number,
you got three minutes to leave the house.

OK. Now, let's come on.
We got to go.

You want me to punch it in now?
Yeah.

I have to catch a bus.
Petey, come on. Come. Good dog.

Warm up the car.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)

Hi, we're havin' some trouble
with this alarm.

Hey, there.

Hey. What's the, uh...
what's the problem with the alarm?

Oh, no problem. I just need you to turn
it off so I can get inside real quick.

It's OK, I'm friends with the owner.

Left some insurance paperwork in there.

Gotta turn in Mr. Hauer's policy
or it'll lapse.

Oh.

Yeah.
Huh.

You know, uh...
anyone can print these up.

N... You met me earlier.
Hm-hm.

OK. Tell you what.

Maybe it's worth, uh... extra 20.

You think I'm stupid?
Just 'cause I don't have a fuckin' suit?

You businessmen. You know,
I'm tryin' to run a business, too.

But I'll tell you what,
this'll cover the gas

gettin' all the way
back out here, so thanks.

Hey, don't act so innocent.
I saw you try and steal that clock earlier.

Excuse me?
Excuse me?

You know exactly what I'm talkin' about.

Your word against mine, motherfucker.

OK, well your fingerprints
are all over that thing.

So I'll tell you what,
we'll call the cops and we'll see...

Hey, we don't need the cops.
Be quick about it, OK?

(ALARM BEEPING)

Yeah, I know.

(BEEPING STOPS)

Hey! Hurry up, we gotta go!

I see you found your "paperwork."

Oh, hi, uh...
Somebody is here.

Frank. What are you doin' here?
Oh...

I came over to check on the house.
Make sure all the doors are locked.

Oh.

I thought you were on a road trip.
It got delayed because of the weather.

Gorvy still here?

No, no, no. I had to...
had to get him down to the bus...

...the bus station. He's good.

Who is this guy? Is everything OK?

Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.
He's with me.

No, I am not. Don't you try to...
Let me handle this.

Hey, what's goin' on here?

It's my fault, I had to go up
to get these papers earlier

to get back to the office ASAP because
I'm tryin' to get the place insured.

What's in the bag there?
Oh, I knew this was not a good idea.

No.
I'm gonna get goin', guys.

Hold on, wait a minute.
You're not goin' anywhere.

I saw your van,
it's got your name on it.

Frank, take it easy. Calm down.
I'm callin' the cops.

No, no, no. Listen.
No. No! No! Jesus!

I said... no... cops!

Will somebody
please fucking listen to me?!

I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean to kill him.

This guy...


You didn't come here for paperwork,
did you? You came here to rob the joint.

And that, plus this dead guy right here,
that's felony murder.

This is your fucking fault, pal.
You're as guilty as me.

(PHONE DISCONNECT
ALERT BEEPING)

I am not gonna go back to jail.
I am not gonna go back to jail.

I cannot go back to jail.

(CAMERA WHIRRING)

OK.

You're gonna keep your mouth shut
or I'm gonna take you down with me.

You got it?


All right, let's think here. Let's take a
second here. Let's fuckin' pause.

Would you hang up the fucking phone
so I can think?!

All right! So...

...we can't just leave him here
because I turned off the alarm

and the old man knows I got the code
so I'm gonna be a suspect.

I got a blow torch in my van. I tell you
what, we're gonna light this place up.

No, no. I know about
arson investigations. Don't.

You know about arson investigations?
That's not a good idea?

No? Really? You got a good idea?

No?

We could, uh...

Um... Ah!
We'll dump him in a lake! You know?

I got my ice fishing gear in my van.

Lakes around here,
they stay frozen until May.

By then there'll be
nothin' left of the guy, right?

Help me roll him up in the carpet.
No, he'll know it's missing.

Then start cleaning it or something.
I got a, uh...

...a tent in my van.
We'll wrap him up in that.

Wait, wait, wait.
I gotta reset the alarm.

Close the door.
Close the goddamn door.


Pop your trunk.

I don't want him oozin' all over my van.
I sleep in it sometimes.

My trunk's full. He'll never fit.

Follow me, all right? We're gonna go
to Antioch, I got a lake up there.

And listen, hey...

Don't try to bail on me.
Remember, right, I got this, right?

Tell you what.
I'm gonna hold on to your fiddle, too.

What's so special
about this fuckin' thing?

It's a violin. Sentimental value.

Snow shoes. That's how he got here.
What?

Somebody's out there.
We gotta kill some time.

It's a slow sport.

Come on.

Let's go. Hey. Hey, hey.

Let's go. Hey-ho, hey. Snap out of it,
all right? You're gonna act normal.

Hey, you're actin' normal.

It's just, you know...
We'll go in and get a beer.

Right? And stay away from the burgers.
Curds are good, though.

So, how long before someone notices?

What? I don't know. Maybe they won't.

He was a truck driver.
He was on the road a lot.

But he ain't comin' home
this time, right?

I didn't realize you had been to jail.

Yeah. My cousin set me up.

Meth lab. Blew up.

I took the fall for it.
Have you ever seen a meth lab blow up?

Oh... You got to. It's spectacular.

You have flames comin' out...
everywhere.

Of course, I had to beat him
to a bloody pulp when I got out, but...

...it's nothin' permanent.

We're good now.

Now, have... have you had
the cheese curds here before?

I love 'em.

Would you like one?
I have plenty.

We picked a fuckin' nice night for this.
Do not just stand there, right now.

You understand? Do something.
Untie him or you can dump him out

while I'm doin' some work.

Hey! Goddamn it,
do not freeze up on me.

Hey, jerk. Don't go south.

There you go. Here, here!
Warm up! Calm down!

Shit.

(RAPID CLICKING)
No, no, no, no, no.


All right.

So... we can't make that bigger.

That needs to get smaller.

Got it?

And that's not gonna be a "me" job, pal.
That's a "we" job.

So... time for you to man the fuck up

in your little suit there.
Here, take it.

(WHISPERS) I can't.
Yes, you can.


And I guess I'm gonna start
with the head maybe or the feet.


(COUGHING)
Don't be sick here! Hey, hey, hey!

There's DNA in that shit!
Go back to the fuckin' car.

Puke in your own car. Go!


(WHIRRING RESUMES)


Did you hear somethin'?
I'm sick.

(COUGHING)
Thought I heard somethin'.

Hey.

Keep your mouth shut.
(WHIRRING STARTS, STOPS)

(PANTING)
(DOOR CLOSING, ENGINE STARTS)


(DOOR CLOSING, CAR STARTING)

KARLA: Mickey, your landlord called
and said your rent check bounced.

(PHONE RINGING)
Prohaska Agency.

Hold on.

Some locksmith said he needs
to talk to you right away.

I lost my keys.
Mickey.

The landlord's got my name
as a reference. I vouched for you.

Here.

Give him that.

OK?
OK.

Well, I'm not coming back
before my class.

He's gonna charge you for that key,
you know.

Hello.

BOY: Go, go! Cover him!

Take it out!
BOY 2: Go, go, go!

Oh, shit!

What's going on?

I saw my van in daylight
is what's going on, and it is fucked up.

You got me rolling around with
somebody's blood on my floor.

I know a guy who can detail it but, you
know, what am I supposed to tell him?

What? Huh?

Tell him I was cleaning fish
or somethin'.

You know what? It doesn't
fuckin' matter. He doesn't care.

He just wants the money,
and you owe me, too.

And I need a new tent.
And my Makita's all jacked up.

I gotta drive up to...
fuckin' Hurley to ditch it.

Near my stepbrother's cabin,
and I hate my stepbrother.

So... I need five grand from you.
Right now.

I don't have that kind of cash on me.

OK. Well, I think you better
get it by Monday...

...or, um...


Yeah.

OK.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Well, my secretary handles all of my
finances, she obviously screwed up.

Well, I've been a card member
for, like, 20-something years.

Just raise my credit limit
so I can get some cash here. That's...

Can I speak to a supervisor?

OK. I'm... Karla, I'm sorry.
I just... I'm desperate.

You know, it's not my fault
your credit cards are all maxed.

You're the one
with the gambling problem.

What are you talking about?

The $20,000 you spent
at the convention.

You were in the casino the whole time,
weren't you?

Shit.

I had my wallet stolen
when I was up there.

She must have used my credit cards
while I was asleep. Goddamn it!

(MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)



I need some of that $30,000.

Come on, you gotta help me.
I'm in real trouble here.

Jo Ann, I know you have it
in an account.

Just get out of here, Mickey.

Hey, you know what?
This is my church, too.


Jo Ann, when did you
get so goddamn vindictive?

Shh!
You know what?

I'm in real trouble here. OK?

<i>JOANN: You did it to yourself.</i>

Right here. I just want the cash today.

Oh. Oh, sorry, Mickey.
Today.

No, no. No, I can't take it
unless it's a trade-in.

We're already overstocked
in this model. Sorry.

(BANG ON WINDOW)

Glen, I gotta call you back.

Yeah, no, everything's fine.

Uh-huh.

I... I don't have the money yet.
I need a little more time.

Well, that's gonna be a problem.

Take the violin.

You can take it. It's worth $30,000.

Are you really gonna
try to jack with me?

No. It's an important instrument,
it comes from Germany.

Oh, it's German?
Yeah.

I didn't realize it was German.
No...

That's ama...
What, do you think I'm stupid?

Look at me. Look at me. Why would
I have bothered to take this thing?

Huh?

What am I supposed to do with it?
You can sell it. You can pawn it.

Whatever. You take it,
it's yours. That's yours.

But I... I work here.
You can't be here. You need to go.

$30,000?
Yeah.

You better not be screwing with me.

OK.

(ENGINE STARTING)

Hey.
What's happenin', Bob?

I just came by, I had some
of these auto policies...

Hey, did you get my note?
I've been a little busy.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, well...
Yeah?

I am glad that you got Gorvy Hauer
an insurance policy.

I'm also glad that he got
a security system.

Why, what happened?
Well, apparently,

he's got a very valuable violin at home.

He... Did he tell you that?
No, no, no.

I was... I stopped by the office
a couple days ago.

A fax came in, it was marked "urgent."
I left you a note about all this.

Anyway, there was an appraisal
of this violin.

Figured I'd let Gorvy know as soon
as I... as soon as I found out.

And, you know, his sister...

...his sister passed, which is, um...
Oh, my God, rest her soul.

But this... this news certainly
seemed to cheer Gorvy up a bit.

Look, I did all the paperwork.
It's all taken care of.

The violin is now insured
for its full value.

Oh.

So you turned that in?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, I know that you're gunning
for Aruba.

So I figured,
every commission, you know?

I'm, uh... I'm pickin' Gorvy up
tomorrow at the bus station.

He's comin' back home. I can't wait
to get a look at that violin.

I'll get him. I wanna congratulate him.

Really? You sure?
Yeah, I got it.

What time's he get in? Good.
He gets in around three.

God, can you imagine?
Lookin' in your attic and findin' a violin

worth a million dollars?

A million dollars? What do you mean?
A million point two-five.

That's what the appraisal
put the market value at.

What happened?
You told me it was worth $30,000.

Yeah, well, it's a good thing
you asked for a second opinion.

I sent the photos I took
to a colleague in London.

He's a leading authority on Stainer.
He's cited extensively

throughout that book that I lent you.

Your violin dates back
to the early 1600s.

It's an original. It's not a copy.
You should've called me immediately.

Of course. I tried.
No one answered, so I sent you a fax.

My collector's in Europe.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks

and he is prepared to pay you
the full appraisal.

It's not for sale.

The owner changed his mind.
I gave you a security deposit

in good faith.
Yeah.

Karla, can I get a check?
We have a deal. You agreed.

Karla!

What's he gonna do with it?

What's gonna happen?
I don't really know.

Well, I can talk to him.
Thank you.

I'll explain. You tell him
to talk to me and I'll explain.

I have to get going.
If you think you're gonna sell this

thing on your own,
you are sadly mistaken.

It's a cloistered world.

I'd like my book back.
Here.

(VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING)

Mickey. Mickey, guess what?
I have a famous violin.

I stopped by the bus station
to pick you up, but I missed ya.

Oh, yeah, yeah. It was early.
Bob came and picked me up.

Oh. Did Bob see the violin?
Well, he saw it,

but I didn't let him touch it.
OK, that's very smart.

You shouldn't let anybody touch it.
Yeah.

I wouldn't even let anybody
see the thing

because you can't trust people, Gorvy.
No, no.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nobody can be trusted. Understand?

Look what Bob gave me, a book about
my violin and the man who made it.

It's from Vienna,
a long, long time ago, in Austria.

Oh, I want so much to go there,
now that I have seen this book.

You know... (SIGHS)

...when my sister died,
there was nothing in the papers.

There was two numbers, birth and death.

Now, when I die,
they will say something about me.

They'll say I have a famous violin.

That you kept to yourself.
Yeah.

And you didn't show it to anybody.

You need to stop spending time
with Gorvy Hauer.

We're salesmen.
We're not professional visitors.

Sorry. You're right, you're right.

I just... I saw an opportunity that
might benefit him and us, you know?

I mean, why let that violin
just sit in his house?

Why not let other people enjoy it,
like maybe a soloist or a museum?

I mean... and, look,
the good... thank you.

The good news is that Gorvy is actually
willing to pay the additional fee

for the travel rider.
You've talked to him about this?

About, uh... loaning out that...

About the violin?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

I joined the Kiwanis,
like we talked about.

I meet a guy who's a member
of the local philharmonic.

Now, I'm sure that he knows
a bunch of other musicians

who all have valuable instruments
that we could insure.

It could be a whole new market.
No. No, no, no.

Bob, I can't... No. I...

I have to let you go.

You, uh... That's it.

That's what I brought you here for.

One of my top sales guys,
he wants your territory and, uh...

...I don't know what to tell him.
I mean, he's... he wants it.

You're firing me? I...

I left another job to...
to come work with you.

Yeah.
I mean, I thought I was

actually doing a pretty good job, too.

Yeah, I know. It's the damndest thing.
I mean, it's, uh...

I don't know. I don't know what to do,
he's been with me a long time.

That's pretty unexpected. I...

I don't know what
I'm gonna tell my wife.

Well, look, I'll be happy to write
you a recommendation. OK?

I'm sure Phil Peters would be happy
to have you back on board.

Thanks, Mickey. Thank you.
Yeah.

I'd like to stay in touch. And I'd like
to hear about Gorvy and his violin.

I actually sent someone out today
to see if they could loan it out.



Gorvy?

I thought you were my friend.
What's wrong? What's the matter?

I am your friend.

A man came to look at the violin.

He says it's not old,
it's not from Austria.

It's from China, from some factory.

He could tell by looking at size of holes.

Oh.
I paid good money for insurance policy.

Now Bob tells me
I have to pay even more.

Bob's gone. I let him go.

OK? And you're gonna get a full refund
on your premium.

We were gonna go to Europe,
me and Petey.

We were gonna show this
to famous people, let them play it.

Now we can't go anywhere.

Well, you can still play it for Petey.

Right? I mean,
he loves that thing. Pete.

(PETEY WHINING)
Petey, Pete. Hey. (WHISTLES)

Get over...
GORVY: He carried it around like a stick,

now he won't even look at it.

Petey, come, come.
Come on.

(PETEY WHINING)

Wait... Oh.

No, no.

There's no teeth marks in this.

No teeth marks. Petey has big teeth.
He would leave teeth marks in this.

And there's none.

I don't think this is my violin.

(PETEY WHINING, BARKING)
He... he's gotta go outside.

Someone took my violin
while I was gone.

They took my clock, too.

Gorvy, you're...
you're watching too much TV.

I'm going outside
to wait for the police.

The police, what?
Yeah, they're on their way.

(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)

GORVY: My dog is gone! He's loose!

Afternoon, sir.
Hi.

Listen, I just got a call on the radio

that you had some kind of theft
out here.

Excuse me, is this, uh...
is this the violin he called us about?

Uh...
What did... what did he say?

Uh, according to Mr. Hauer, this one...

...this one is not his.

Apparently, the one he owns
is quote unquote, "famous."

anything about that. He's pretty old.

Well, I don't either, but, uh... I have to
take this back to the station with me.

So, uh... did you or did he
see any signs of forced entry?

No.
Or was there anything else missing?

No, he's...
Uh, anything else out of place?

No?
He's... he's, uh...

Doesn't even lock the doors here.

Well, I see he got
a security system, though.

Yeah, he never sets it.
He's a pretty congenial guy.

People come and go here.
OK.

He's... a nice, old fella.

And you are?
Mickey Prohaska.

I'm a friend of the family, actually.

He, uh... Give you my card. He'd probably
wanna run this thing through me.

He's pretty senile.
Prohaska... insurance?

Sorry to bother you with this.

Yes. Yes.
Yeah?

And you're family? You're related?

Yes. I'm, uh... not blood family,

but, you know, like family.
OK.

GORVY: Doggy, come home, doggy.

Gorvy?
Come home, doggy.

My doggy's gone. Now I lost everything.

When is the police gonna get here?

They left.
Call 'em back!

They need to help me find Petey.
No, they can't help you.

Why not?
I'll help you.

It's going to be 20 below tonight.

Too cold for Petey.

You never liked him, did you?

You should've been more careful!

Pull over here. They know me here.

Frank gets gasoline here sometimes.
I will give them a picture of Petey.

(CLEARING THROAT)

MAN: <i>The cops aren't gonna be</i>
<i>as invested in finding this thief</i>

<i>as our company is.</i>

<i>This trucker's probably our best lead.</i>

Well, it makes a lot of sense. I mean,
this Frank guy was way too interested

in everything
out at this farmer's house.

And how much it was worth
and he had the keys.

We had a tough time gettin' a hold
of the owner, even by phone. It's busy.

They finally got through and got
a recorded statement from him.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it really didn't add a lot.

I think the guy is really sick.
Sign this.

(HORN HONKING)

MAN: Get in the fucking car!

Get in the fucking car!

(SIREN WAILING NEARBY)

I said no cops, didn't I?
I had to.

They found out about the violin.

I know they found out about the violin,
'cause I got a message from the old man

who wants a refund on his security
system, because he said it didn't go off

when he was robbed.

Didn't you tell me that no one would
fucking notice the violin was gone?

He got suspicious
when he couldn't find his clock.

It was my mom's birthday.
OK.

Do you understand that?

You're not tryin' to pin this on me,
are you?

Hey! You're not tryin' to pin this
on me, are you?

No, no. They think it's Frank Richie.
Who?

That's the man you killed.

That's the guy.

That's why I went in to talk to 'em.
I had to!

I was tryin' to convince them!
(WHISPERS) Wait.

What are you doin'?
Wait.

Are you fucking kidding me?
What?

You said no one
would be looking for the guy!

Nobody would give a shit about him!

That's what we had going for us!
Now everybody's gonna be looking for him!

What is wrong with you?

You told me nobody
would give a shit about him!

God! And nobody would care about
the fuckin' violin, either.

Right now, everybody's looking
for the violin.

Why is everybody looking
for the violin?

I don't know.
You're not lyin' to me

about how much it's worth, are you? Huh?
Look at me, look at me. Is it $100,000?

How much is this fucking thing worth?!
A million.

What did you say?
A million.

That's a million dollar violin?

Holy shit.

I couldn't even get 500 bucks for it.

Who... who were you
plannin' on sellin' it to?

I'm done with this. OK? I don't know!
I don't know anything about violins!

I was... I was gonna have a dealer
in Chicago sell it, but...

What are you doin'?

Goin' to Chicago to see this dealer.
No, no, no. He's by appointment only.

I'm not even sure if he's there.
I want to sell this fucking thing

tonight!
No! He's not gonna help us.

It's stolen!

I don't even know
who he was gonna sell it to.

Oh, yeah? Well, you got
a 90 minute ride to figure it out.

And I still got that picture, jerk.

You would never make it in jail.

MAN: Which one, down here?
MICKEY: Here.

Look, he's not there.

MAN: I don't give a fuck.
We're goin' inside, my friend.

Get back. Back, back,
back, back, back, back.

Chill out.

See? There we go. After you, asshole.

Now look, you go find the fuckin'
number or I will sit in the corner

and I will wait here all night long.

And when he comes back in,
then I will get the number out of him.

He was, uh... he was on the...
He was on the phone...

Work it out. Find it.

...talkin' to a guy.
A guy who owns stolen violins.

He stuck the number in a book.

This is pretty neat, though, huh?
Look at that.

There's some shit in here.

That's it, Stoller. That's it.

Get the hell outta here. You can call
him tomorrow. Here's the number.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Me call?
I'm not your fuckin' secretary.

You're gonna make the phone call.
I'm not havin' it traced to my phone.

And guess what? When you set this
thing up, you're gonna be the one

makin' the handoff. Because thanks
to you, it's not just a hot violin,

<i>you went and attached it</i>
<i>to a fucking dead guy.</i>

Mr. Stoller, please.

I see. Do you have any estimation
as to when he'll be back in the States?

Yeah. No, no message. Thank you.

Hey, Glen. What's goin' on?
Mickey.

Frank Richie's dead.

they found him... they found him?

Yeah. In a cemetery.

We ran the Social Security number
he gave on the lease application.

Turns out it belongs to a guy
who died 12 years ago.

Yeah. Looks like our suspect is... Well,
he's been using somebody else's name.

Are you kidding me? There you go.

Can you believe it?
(CHUCKLES) That's it, right?

What more proof do you need than that?

Obviously. Why else would the guy
be using somebody else's name?

You know? Must be some sort of
professional drifter or something.

I don't know how professional he is.
Glen said he stuck a photocopied label

on the inside of a cheap violin
and rubbed it with shoe polish.

Yeah, the expert in Chicago confirmed
it wasn't the one he'd had appraised.

There was a store label on the inside
underneath what is called the, uh...

(PHONE RINGING)
...F hole.

There's a call for you on line one,
he says it's urgent.

Tell him...
Told him you were in a meeting, but...

Hey, go ahead. You can take it.
You can take it here.

Go ahead.

Hello?
MAN: <i>Yeah, fucking hello!</i>

<i>We got a problem over here...</i>
Yeah.

No, I'm here with some people right now.

<i>I don't... (INDISTINC T SHOUTING)</i>
<i>Get your ass over here!</i>

Just... maybe I can call you back.
<i>No!</i>

All right, I'll see you there.
<i>I am losing my fucking shit over here!</i>

Hm-hm.
<i>I'm about to freak the fuck out!</i>

What happened?

Huh? Why couldn't you make the deal?

He's on a ship somewhere.

His secretary said to call back
in a few weeks.

(GASPING CHUCKLE)

Oh, my God. You are just... exhausting.

A few weeks. Oh.

Can I show you something?
Do you see that ice out there?

It's not pancake ice anymore,
it's honeycombed. It's melting too fast.

Do you understand that? Pretty soon
our suspect, or what's left of him,

is gonna come floating to the top,
and when that happens

somebody is gonna
put two and two together.

We have gotta sell that violin
before that happens.

I need that fucking money,
I have got to get out of town!

I am not going back to jail.

And until that happens
I'm not leaving town, you understand?

I'll be watching your every move.

Make it happen.

I talked to someone at the hotel
you stayed in at the convention,

they said your credit cards were used
to buy a bunch of traveler's checks.

Ah-ha. I found a footprint.
And it wasn't Frank's, it was fancy.

Frank wears boots. I have to go now
and tell the police what I discovered.

Mickey? I have some forms
for you to sign.

Glen just faxed them over
for the violin payout.

MICKEY:
My company's gonna honor your claim.

GORVY: They found my violin?

No. But they're gonna
compensate you for it.

I'm having all the money
wired into your account.

I don't want money. I want my violin.

But you want to go to Europe.

And you can't do that
with a violin, Gorvy.

But you can do that with money,
and now you have it. And I...

I can't go nowhere.
What if my doggy comes back?

I, uh... I wanted to talk to you about that.

I, uh... I found him
on the side of the road.

He was... he was dead.
What?

He had been hit by another car.
I'm having him cremated...

Oh, my God.
...so that you can take him with you.

They left my doggy
on the side of the road?

What's wrong with people these days?
How can they do what they do?

It used to be you could trust people.

You could leave your door open
in the middle of the night and now,

they kill your doggy.

You were right, Mickey.

You can't trust nobody anymore.

Mr. Stoller, please.

This is Frank Richie.
I think I have something you may want.

Yes.

<i>OK.</i>

<i>Of course. But it will have to be cash.</i>

(PHONE DIALING)

MICKEY: <i>I talked to Stoller, OK?</i>
<i>It's on. His train gets in at 2:55.</i>

All right, it's over. It's over.

Just leave the bag. Get up.
Get up and go, go. Stay calm, though.

Hello? Hello, excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir!

Sorry. You forgot your bag.

You're welcome.

Wait!

Take it. Take it!
I don't want it!

You understand? I don't want it!
It's tied to a fucking murder!

Do you understand that?
It's a hot potato!

Are you an idiot? Get away from me!
I want that photograph. Hey!

Please.


All right. Here you go, look.

OK? Got it? And we never met,
none of this ever happened.

You do not even know my fucking name,
you got it?

MICKEY: <i>One thing folks</i>
<i>in the insurance business know,</i>

<i>you can't put a price tag</i>
<i>on peace of mind.</i>

<i>What starts out lookin'</i>
<i>like an easy score</i>

<i>can turn out to be anything but simple.</i>

<i>Sure, you might get lucky.</i>
<i>You could end up striking gold.</i>

<i>Just not in the way you bargained for.</i>

Can I help you with somethin'?
I was just here to see Gorvy Hauer.

He must still be outta town.
Well, I'm Gorvy Hauer.

What can I do for ya?

No. We never rent the place out.
No.

Say, I've got a little Danish
if you'd like some.

Cup of coffee?
No.

You sure?
We've lived in this house 28 years.

Twenty-nine.
Twenty-nine.

We never had any problems. Well...
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Except that time when we came back
from Florida and the pipes were frozen.

Yeah. We forgot
to leave a little heat on.

Have to leave a little heat on.
But we're gone all winter.

We're snow birds.

You know the insurance company never
gave... We had to wait six months

before we got any money from them.
That's right.

Would you be able to check on a policy?
Maybe we could switch over. Um...

Save us some money, maybe, on, uh...
something like that?

Yeah. I'll get back to you.
OK, great.

Hey. I'm looking for a guy
that's been in here before.

About this tall, dark hair.

A little wiry. He was sittin' right over
here with me the day of the blizzard.

He got a name?

I'm not really sure.
You got anything to eat here?

We just have fries,
onion rings and cheese curds.

You don't serve burgers here?
Steaks? Brats?

Why would you get a meat delivery?

We wouldn't.
We just got a fire back here.

MICKEY: <i>In the time it took</i>
<i>to knock back a drink,</i>

<i>a dead man came back to life.</i>

<i>Remember, I said to believe</i>
<i>only half of what you see?</i>

Here.

Drink up, buddy.
<i>Well, they had to make sure</i>

<i>the other half wouldn't be seen at all.</i>

<i>But let me back up.</i>

<i>First, they had to hook the guy.</i>
Oh, look. I do have a violin.

<i>And then there was the blackmail</i>
<i>they developed</i>

<i>just to make sure their lead</i>
<i>would be followed.</i>

<i>And they timed it out perfectly.</i>

KARLA: Mickey, I have
some forms for you to sign.

MICKEY: <i>Once they got what they wanted,</i>
<i>the next step was the blow-off.</i>

Excuse me, do you have the time?

<i>Oldest opening line in the book.</i>

<i>Remember? Never fails</i>
<i>to get someone's attention.</i>

<i>When a guy is spooked that bad,</i>
<i>he feels lucky just to walk away.</i>

I need to find out about an account
that was opened up here.

Hi. I'll take this one, Anna.
Hi.

We're still finding pennies
in the strangest places.

But don't worry, we're adding them
to your account, Mr. Hauer.

MICKEY: <i>The old man made sure to stay</i>
<i>on the sidelines and let somebody else</i>

<i>get stuck holding the bag, literally.</i>

<i>They needed an agent</i>
<i>to push the claim through</i>

<i>and take the fall if their scam</i>
<i>was discovered.</i>

<i>You could say</i>
<i>he was their insurance policy.</i>

KARLA: And I'm here doing work.

I've been recycling.
Look what almost got thrown out.

A violin label. I got a call
about the traveler's checks

that were bought
with your credit cards.

They were able to trace the serial
numbers and they were deposited

in a bank in Burlington.

They opened the account that paid
the premium on this policy, right?

I know what you're thinking, Karla,
and it's not what it looks like.

I thought that Golden Harvest
sounded familiar.

It was who the big payout
went to for the violin, wasn't it?

I was duped by this...

...this Gorvy Hauer son of a bitch!

If that's even his name!

No, his name is Mickey Prohaska.
No.

You took out insurance
in someone else's name

on a violin that, hm...
conveniently went missing.

Karla, you gotta believe me.

Why? You lie all the time.

You're good, Mickey.

Winning little awards.

Building your reputation at the company
so your word there would be credible.

All to make this one big payout
seem legit.

Where are you hiding
the money, Mickey?

You can't just
make $1,000,000 disappear.

MICKEY: <i>But they did. They bought</i>
<i>something that couldn't be traced.</i>

There's a lot of money in corn, Mickey.
It's worth its weight in gold.

MICKEY: <i>Feed corn.</i>

<i>Once the insurance settlement</i>
<i>hit the bank,</i>

<i>it was wired out</i>
<i>to a dozen grain elevators</i>

<i>and sold to farmers</i>
<i>in amounts under $ 10,000.</i>

<i>Money laundering. Midwestern style.</i>


<i>The entire operation was financed</i>
<i>with some credit cards</i>

<i>that were temporarily borrowed</i>
<i>by one of their bit players.</i>

<i>Everyone deserves a nice</i>
<i>little getaway, don't they?</i>

<i>Especially after a job well done.</i>

<i>(CHUCKLES) Even the goddamn dog.</i>

<i>How do you like that?</i>

<i>A dog that was never lost,</i>
<i>sought by a man who didn't exist.</i>

Come here. Let me have five bucks
worth of tickets for tonight's lottery

and a pack of Winston's, please.

MICKEY: <i>At least not in the form</i>
<i>of an absent-minded farmer.</i>

<i>Odds are, he was the brains</i>
<i>behind it all.</i>

This guy's on a serious losing streak.

KARLA: <i>If you expect me</i>
<i>to keep quiet, Mickey,</i>

<i>you're gonna have to give me your car.</i>

Or I'm gonna call Glen.

I'm about to take
my state licensing exam.

I can't make sales calls
in this piece of shit.

I should have let you quit
when I had the chance.

I'm done with
the insurance business, Glen.

What are you gonna do?

Head south.

<i>I've had it with these goddamn winters.</i>

Hey, Phil.

Hey.

Never got a chance
to congratulate you on that sales award.

Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
I'm sure you'll take top prize again

in Aruba, even without Bob Egan.

Who?

Bob. The guy from the convention.
You were gonna hire him.

I wasn't gonna hire anybody there.
I got six guys working for me already.

MICKEY: <i>Turns out there was a top</i>
<i>salesman even better than Phil Peters.</i>

Hey, just wanted to say,
love the suit.

Oh, thanks. Thanks.
All right, take care.

MICKEY: <i>He was the roper.</i>
<i>But that wasn't his only role.</i>

Hey, that's a nice car.
It's easy to spot.

MICKEY: <i>He was also the tail.</i>

<i>He knew when the office would be empty</i>
<i>and he had full access</i>

<i>to all the amenities inside.</i>

<i>The entire time, he slipped by unnoticed.</i>

<i>One and a quarter million dollars.</i>
<i>Not a bad severance package.</i>

<i>Even if it was split five ways.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

<i>Remember the good faith deposit?</i>

<i>It's what's known</i>
<i>in a scam as the convincer.</i>

<i>A little taste of bigger riches to come.</i>

<i>For a desperate sucker,</i>
<i>it's the ultimate form of persuasion.</i>

How much did they pay you?

I have no idea
what you're talking about.

This is private property and I'm...
How much did they pay you?

You think I'm not gonna fuckin' turn you
in for tryin' to pass off a fake violin

to an insurance company?
'Cause I don't think

you'd get anywhere with that.
I gave you an appraisal, not a contract.

An appraisal's considered an opinion.
I gave you my opinion. (GRUNTING)

Now it's gone
and nobody knows where it is.

And there's a lot
of corruption out there.

MAN: <i>So the violin was worthless</i>
<i>from the beginning?</i>

Beware of anything
with strings attached.

Yeah, my friend got duped.
Ah, poor bastard.

Whatever happened to him?
Luckily, he made a clean start.

Got away to someplace warm.
Yeah, well, don't tell me about weather.

I'm from Chicago.
Oh.

We got nine months of winter and
then three months of hell. (LAUGHS)

Too bad they stuck you at this place.
Nickel and dime you to death.

Yeah, tell me about it.
Six bucks for a beer.

Wait till you see the bill.
They tack on a resort fee.

All for a tiny room, paper-thin walls
and a rock-hard mattress.

Might as well be sleepin'
in a cardboard box.

Right.

You know, I know a place
just a couple miles down the road.

Take a look at that.

What is this, a time share?
It's an opportunity.

Own a little piece
of the sunshine state.

I can probably get you into an
all-you-can-eat buffet for free

just by comin' by.
I'm flyin' back home tomorrow.

What time's your flight?
4:30.

Oh! Terrific. They're gonna make you
check out of the room at noon.

I'll pick you up,
take you over there myself.

I don't know.
You gotta eat.

I mean, this restaurant
will charge you an arm and a leg.

Sure. (CHUCKLES)

What the hell. (LAUGHS)
OK.

All right, I'll pick you up
in the lobby at 11:00...

Jerry.
Jerry.

I'm gonna take this.
Yeah.

Excuse me, do you
happen to have the time?
