(high-pitch engine rumbling)


to find my sister,
Michelle, but the police

and the American Embassy found her first.

This may sound a little strange,

but yesterday afternoon

your sister Michelle was found unconscious

in her hotel room.

If what you say is true,

the vampire Radu is here in Bucharest

and your sister is his disciple.

help of Professor Popescu

from the Folk Art Museum...

(door creaks)

I discovered the awful truth.

(squish, splatter)

And fell into the clutches of
an ancient family of vampires.


No, please!

Let her go.

Drink will be fed to me.

Savor the taste of your
sister's suffering.

No!

Die, you bastard.

Come on, Michelle.

I can't.

The sun...

Okay,

I'll wait for you 'til dark.



(whimpering, screaming)

(ominous music)



I curse you for your beauty,

for the innocence of your flesh,

for the power you hold over my child.


Her blood will give you life.


(soft music)

(speaks Romanian)

Is there a telephone here, please?

Telephone?

Da.


Hello?

Uh, Bucharest, the
American Embassy, please.

Uh...

(speaks Romanian)

(shutter clicks)

Lieutenant?

Yeah?

(speaks Romanian)

What's the story, Lieutenant?

What about Michelle?

Sorry miss, no sister.

No Radu, no little witch.

She's in there somewhere, she has to be.

Please miss, tell me again

what's happening here.

Who killed Popescu?

Becca, we want to believe you.

They're vampires, Mel.

Vampires, Marin.

Or something worse.

Marin, can I talk to you for a moment?

Yes.

Excuse me, miss.

(speaks Romanian)

(eerie music)




Oh, no!

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, please.


Don't hurt me.

We're together now,

pretty one.


Mortals have defiled my sanctuary.

We must fly.

(overlapping chanting)



(groaning, yelling, cackling)

Rebecca!

I'm sorry.

Okay, there's definitely
something weird going on here.

Some kind of explosion, yeah?

No!

It was them leaving.

I could hear Michelle screaming in there.

(screaming, cackling)


Our sanctuary.

Returned to us at last.

Call me when you wake up.

I'll come get you.

Would you stay with me tonight?

I don't want to be alone.

Yeah.

Sure.

(eerie music)

From this night forward

we shall be as one.

All that is mine will be yours.

Kneel before your master.

Let me out of here.

I will let you out.

I might even set you free.

When you're ready.

You promised you would
teach me everything.

First you must learn patience.

We have all the time in the world.

(ghostly breathing)





Some day child,

when Radu tires of you

you'll belong to me.

Then you'll know horror.









My Nikolai...

I'm sorry.

My condolences, ma'am.

He was a fine scholar, and uh,

a delightful gentleman.

He was a crazy old fool.


Ma'am, last time we were here I...

I left some papers in his office.

I was wondering-

Yes, go ahead.

But please don't disturb anything.


This is Lieutenant Marin,

Police of Dublin.

Where is the gate, please?

How do we get inside?

(speaks Romanian)

Hello!

For Christ's sake.

Should we drop the stakes or what?

Uh, no, just um...

Act natural.

Buna ziua, my friend.

Marin.

I'm glad to see you're finally

taking me seriously, Lieutenant.

It's very serious.

Murder.

And now, uh, why are you here?

To see if Marin is doing duty?

Uh no, we're just, uh...

Looking around.

(speaks Romanian)

Look, come here.

Empty graves,

missing persons,

dead Popescu.

This case making me crazy!

Have you gotten into the
castle yet, Lieutenant?

No, no, it's no one to open gate.

No, we need written permission to enter.

Permission?
[Marin] Yeah.

From whom?

Oh, the keeper of antiquities.

How long is that gonna take?

Two weeks.

Maybe two months.

We can't wait that long!

God knows what could happen by then.

Now listen!

Listen to me, miss.

I wish this case to be
solved as much as you!

Calm down, Marin.

I'm calm, but...

I told big boss your vampire story.

You know what's happening?

What?

He scream at me for half hour.

Now I am big trouble thank you to you!

Yeah well...

The trouble is just beginning, Marin.

Department of Police is not believing

in the vampires.

What are you doing here Lieutenant?

What is your theory?

Your sister is mixed up in black magics.

Antiques stolen from graves.

Excuse me, Lieutenant.

Please.

Thanks, Marin.
[Marin] It's alright.

(speaks Romanian)


Becca.

Hey!

You know, you really shouldn't

try so hard to piss people off.

I'm sorry Mel,

but with him it just comes so naturally.

Hey, I told you:

he's not the smartest guy in town,

but he can be a good ally.


Come on.

Here.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

Hey, wait!

Uh-huh.

My friends...

What's happening?

This is Popescu's secret way in.

It's not enough I am
in big trouble, huh?

You want me to be fired, too?

Okay.

Okay.

Go on.

Okay, go on!

Quickly, quickly, quickly.

(ominous music)


It's blocked.

They've blocked the passageway.


You are sure this is correct way?


It wasn't like this before.

they were expecting us.

Tomorrow morning.

Come talk to big boss.

Speak for yourself, yeah?
Yes.

We'll do that, Marin.

Can't wait to meet him, Lieutenant.

(dramatic orchestral music)

Wait, Rebecca!

Look, it's getting late.

We should get out of here before dark.

Okay.

I just want to watch the
place for a little while.

They're in there.

Don't let them see us!

Jesus...

We're not safe here.

Come on, let's go.

Come on, we can't do anything
'til daylight anyway.

Come on!

(doors click)


(engine turns over, revs)

What are you doing? Just go!

They dare to challenge us?

Your sister is a foolish one!

Leave her alone.

I'll do anything.

Sever the ties to your
mortality, Michelle.

All your pain will turn to pleasure.

She's my sister.

I love her.

There's no love between
the living and the dead.

What you feel is hunger.

Hunger for life.

Kneel before your master.

You promised to teach me.

Destroy her, Radu!

She curses you in her heart.

I shall grant you all I promised...

When you prove yourself worthy.

(jazzy party music)

What's it say?

Man, this is some wild stuff.

According to this legend, the castle

was originally owned by
this family of sorcerers,

until this Vladislas guy

came along and seduced the daughter...

Cerise.

She gave birth to the monstrous Radu,

and then apparently...

Vladislas murdered most of the family off,

drove the rest of them from the region,

and claimed the castle as his own.

This Vladislas sounds
like a ruthless character.

No...

Apparently he was the good guy.


(eerie whispering)



Michelle, please!

What's wrong?

I can't.

I can't.
Okay.

It's just...

It's just too much right now.

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

I'm sorry too.

(owl hoots)

What is it?

Reach out with your senses.

The violinist is a disgrace.

Teach me to fly.

As you do.
Patience, pretty one.

Before the mysteries, you must...

Learn to survive,

to hunt...

To move with stealth.

(ghostly breathing)

Vex your inner powers.

(mystic zap)

You are a magnificent creature.

(upbeat music)

(eerie music)


(mysterious, suspenseful music)

(speaks Romanian)

Take him!

(intense music)


(speaks Romanian)


What? What is it?

I heard a scream.

Oh, it must've just come from the tavern.

(engine turns over)

Hey,

there's your friend Lieutenant Marin.

No!

Yeah.

I'll be darned.

He's spying on us.

We must go now.

The sun has come.

Wait.

I want to see the dawn.

We will wait.

Until the pain begins.

Is it true?

That the sunlight can kill us?

Yes.

What else?

What else can kill a vampire?

Many things.

Kill me, Radu.

You've destroyed me.

Some day...

The sadness you feel
will be a sweet memory.

I can't bear this any longer.

I love you, Michelle.

I shall love you until the end of time.

I offer you...

My most precious gift.

(orchestral music)

I hate you.

I'll hate you for all eternity.

We must go now.

Our powers will weaken with the light.

(speaking Romanian)

You're gonna like this guy.

He's CIA, but he's totally cool.

(speaking Romanian)

Bob?

Hey, it's Mel.

Put up your tape recorder, buddy.

I've got a favor to ask.

Totally off the record.

(speaking Romanian)

Good morning, miss.

What's going on here?

Good morning, Marin.

Truthfully, it's a bad morning.

Two peoples gone from village last night.

A violin boy from
cantina, a woman from car.

Gone?
[Marin] Yeah.

Like how?

Oh, like poof!

Disappearing.

Now everybody in village talking crazy.

(yelling in Romanian)

What's she saying?

That we shouldn't
have gone to the castle.

That we reawakened...

Something.

Stre-
(speaks Romanian)

Vampires!

Do you believe me now, Lieutenant?

No, no, no I don't believe.

It's a black magic, this violin boy.

He's no good, he's no
good violining for sure.

You are hopeless, Lieutenant.

Come on, Mel.

Right.

Save it, Marin.

Miss!

(people yelling)

(soft music)


Bob won't be here 'til about noon.

That gives us some time to look around.

Come on.


Jesus, Marin.

Don't worry.

I'm only me.

What's happening?

Just exploring, Marin.

Ah.

Looking for vampire, eh?

Oh, Americans.

Crazy people.

Vampires.

It's very nice up here.

Maybe I stay here today.

With you.

Huh?

Suit yourself, Marin.

Just don't be surprised at what you see.

(suspenseful music)

Hey bud.

Jesus Bob! Hey, Marin!

It's okay, he's a friend.

Everybody cool here?


Bob, this is Rebecca.

Rebecca, this is my friend Bob.

Hi Bob.

Nice to meet you.

Ma'am.

And Lieutenant Marin,

Bucharest Police.

I know.

Sir.

Hello. CIA Bob, eh?

I thought you were a smuggler at first.

No sir.
[Marin] Okay.

What's the target here?

We gotta get inside.

You think we can make it up this wall?

Give it a shot.

Good.

Uh, you got the stuff?

Weird shopping list, buddy.

What are we, vampire hunting?

Your show man, I'm just doing a cameo.


This body bag light tight?

100% opaque.

Whoa, whoa, whoa Lieutenant.

Night viewing device.

Don't want to mess with it in daylight.

You're gonna love this.

Silver bullets, melted down from my

neighbor's antique crucifix.

You owe her 500 bucks, pal.

500 bucks?

She started out asking $750.

Nice work, Bob.

Hey man, it's my pleasure.

This makes six rounds each.

That's if we're all participating.

Ma'am,

you know how to use it?

Yeah.

I think I can handle it.
No, no, no.

Are you with us, Marin?

Okay.

But don't tell big boss, okay?

Ma'am.

Rebecca.

Yes ma'am.

What are you doing?

Going up.

Bob and I were old rock climbing buddies.

Are you a climber?

Nuh-uh.

We'll find a way to get you in.

Be careful.

Don't worry.

(soft orchestral music)

Think we can make it?

No problem.

(suspenseful music)

Your turn, man.

You can do that?

No.

That's why I climb with him.

Good luck.


Thanks, man.

You ready?

Jesus.

Good climbing, man.

We're in.

We're gonna go offline now.

Unless you have an
emergency don't call us.

We'll call you.

No!

Mel!

(door creaks)


Sounds like trouble ahead.

Female voice. We're gonna check it out.

No.

The witch doesn't sleep by day.




Heads up, granny!


(rapid gunfire)




Bob?

Come in!

Mel, please!

Answer me!


Hello?

Hello?

(speaks Romanian)


Hello?

It's too much mountains for radio.

We should go for help.

We can't leave yet!

What if they got away?

Okay.

We wait and see.

No matter what happens...

Don't hurt Michelle.

Yes, of course.

You understand what
I'm telling you, Marin?

Yes, don't hurt sister.

Yes.

Wait until it is most dark,

so no one seeing me.


(eerie music)

Don't...

Touch me.

Be kind to me...

And I shall bestow upon you...

Priceless treasure.


(slurping, groan)

Your blood grows bitter.

Soon you'll be mine.

Completely.

(ominous music)


The throne is mine.

My treasure!

Give it to me.

At once!
No.

You defy me?

It belongs to the fledgling mother.

I bestowed it upon her.

You are forbidden my spoils!

Lowly treasures are my birthright.

They are mine

alone!

Anger me not, mother.

Or there will be a bloodbath.

She is the cause of your treachery!

Destroy her!

She's my chosen disciple.

She acts as your master.

You are her master.

As I am yours!

I have no master.

She must die!




Forgive me, mother.


You dare to desecrate me?

Curse you forever.

Now I am alone.

Aren't I?

Pretty one?

Let me drink from the bloodstone.

You're not ready.

Its power will drive you mad.

I killed my father...

My mother...

My entire bloodline.

For you.

What will you grant me in return?

Forgiveness.

For what you've done to me.

There is not enough
forgiveness in the universe...

For all I have done.

Ms. Morgan!

Ms. Morgan.

I'm from the US Embassy.

I'm a friend of Rebecca's.

I would very much like to help you.

I know Rebecca would too.


This mortal has seen too much.

Please sir,

no.

Feast upon him, Michelle.


See the fear

pulsing in his veins?

Drink!

No, please!

Savor the sweetness of his agony.

Please, Ms. Morgan, don't.

We can get you out of here.

Drink, Michelle.

Forget you were ever mortal.

No, please!



Rebecca?


It's me.

Mel?

Can you hear me?

(eerie music)

Please Michelle, answer me!

Mel, please. Somebody!

Can anybody hear me? Please?

Michelle?

Michelle, please.

It's Becky. Please!

Mel?

Where are you?

I can see you.

If you can hear me, please answer me.



Michelle?

Mel, somebody, please!

Please answer me.

This mortal love you bear
is a threat to our existence.

Please Radu, I have to speak to her.

I'll come back, I promise.

I'll do anything if you spare her life.

Very well.

Your sister's life

in return for your absolute devotion.

Michelle?

(ominous music)

Michelle!

Don't come any closer, Becky.

Come back with me, Michelle.

I can't.

I have to stay here.

You're so cold.

You...

You're dead?


You have to go now, Becky.

Not without you.
[Michelle] Please!

Or he'll destroy you, too.

What about my friend?

He's Radu's prisoner.

Please.

Please take me to him.

Curse this sweet reunion.

Marin?

He's dead.

This gun is loaded with silver bullets.

And I will use it if I have to.

I want you to release my friends

and then Michelle and I are leaving,

and you better not try and stop us.

Do you understand?

Perfectly.

(ominous music)

Becca!

Thank God.

Let them go.

As you wish.

Okay Michelle,

let's get out of here.

Take them, fledgling.

Let there be a bloodbath.

Come on, Michelle.

We're leaving.

Kill me, Becky.

No!

Get out of the way, Michelle.

Please,

end this nightmare.

No!

Michelle, don't!

No, Michelle!

You're mine!


(gunshot echoes)


(gunshot echoes, girl screams)


(suspenseful music)


What is it?

The daylight.


Go!

Go!


Come on, Michelle!

No, I can't.

Leave me!


Please Becky,

let me die.

No Ms. Morgan, we're
gonna get you out of here.

No!




Lift!

Cover her!

Cover her please!

Cover her!


The bloodstone, give it to me.

Give it to me and I shall set you free.

You want it?

Go for it!





(suspenseful music)


(static crackle)

(dramatic music)
