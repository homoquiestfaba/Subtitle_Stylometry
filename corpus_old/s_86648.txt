Some guy from the center.

What's wrong with you?
He's fine. Why you duckin'?

You got to watch her.
Better get them contracts tight.

So you gonna be in the next one, right?

Honey!

What are you doing out here?
My mama says l have to
do something with my hair.

Your mama's right about that.
You wanna do this on your own,
or should l come with you?

You can come with me.
Cool. So, what are you thinking?
Some braids?

Snoop Doggy Dogg silky-fine
press and curl?

Or maybe do like Mike
and shave it all off?

Hmm, how 'bout braids?
Braids?

All right, cool. Come on.

Come on. They won't bite.

[ Chattering ]

Whoa. Look who's here.
l thought l was gonna have to
watch cable to see you again.

Raymond needs a little trim
and some braids.

Look, little guy.
You see that guy right there?

<i>Yeah.</i>

l know he has a stupid-looking face,
but what's his hair look like?

All right.
Just all right or a little more
than all right?

A little more.
That's right. And you know why?
'Cause he gets his hair cut by me.

<i>l spent a whole 20 minutes on him.</i>

l'm gonna send you over there
to Stacey to get braided up.

<i>And when you're done,</i>
<i>l'm gonna spend 22 minutes on you.</i>

Now how does that sound?

That's cool.

All right, now you just chill, shorty.
Don't worry about nothin'.

Besides, l never mess up
a kid's head,

especially when his mom's
in the shop.

[ Chuckles ]
He's eight. That would have made me 1 4.

l'm not that kind of girl.
My bad.

We just peoples.

Yeah, we peoples.
You peoples?

Player, how'd you swing that?
l've been trying to be her peoples
for weeks. Ain't had no luck.

That's just the way it goes.

Fresh air?
Michael, this is New York.

l, uh-- l taught them at the center.

ln fact, uh,

seeing them on the set there today
gave me an idea for Ginuwine's video.

What are you thinking?
Okay.

New York, the hood.
Ginuwine's doing his thing.

But instead of the usual hoochies,
you get a posse of kids, dancers.

They bust out, all G'd up,
just like Ginuwine--

same hair, same bling.
Like a--

Like a hip-hop pied piper?
Right.

l like it.
Really?

Yeah.

l'll pitch it to him.
Cool, cool.

You know, if he goes for it,
l'd like to audition my kids.
Oh, l see.

You just wanna get those
Fresh Air Fund kids into show biz.

He's been busy.

Check this out. He's part of my crew.

And when you're in my crew,
you don't mess with other shit.

So you tell him l'm looking for him.
l'm not gonna do that.

What?

Why not?

l asked you a question!
<i>- Yo, Honey. Hey.</i>

B.B., what's poppin'?
Am l interrupting?
Well, if it ain't Floyd the Barber.

[ Chuckles ]
How are things in that cute
little barbershop of yours, B.?

You making ends meet?
Oh, you know.
l'm definitely doing me.

Getting this paper.
''Getting this paper.''

you give me a holler. l'll hook you up.

l wanna see that kid.

[ Scoffs ]

You okay?
Yeah, l'm cool.

What was that all about?
How did you get on B.B.'s bad side?

l made the wrong friend, l guess.

Well, you know,
you should stay away from him.

He's dangerous. Seriously.

Yeah. Thinking of picking up some
pepper spray tomorrow or something.

Did l say thank you?
[ Chuckles ]

You sure you don't want me to walk you
upstairs and make sure you're safe?

No. l can handle myself.

[ Chuckles ]
Thanks again.

Uh--

Bye.

[ Chattering, lndistinct ]

Come on.

Mom, what happened?
Another pipe burst.
You can't be in here.

How long will it take to fix?
Oh, who knows?
Building codes, inspections.

Now the city wants to do a full
assessment, see if the building's
even worth reopening.

Ma, you can't let them shut you down.
<i>Honey,</i>

your telling me what l can and cannot do
is not gonna improve my mood right now.

l don't know what to do about this.
lf there's a danger to the kids--

He's one of those kids,
you know, trying to act all bad.

But 1 0 seconds into a routine,
l catch a glimpse of him.

lt's like l can just see
this light shining out of him.

He's a kid again.
Yeah.

lt's the best feeling l know seeing that.

lt's scary though.

'Cause when l think of him hanging out
with B.B., it's like l can watch that light
get dimmer and dimmer.

Well, you know, when a thug joint's
the hottest spot in the hood,

it's hard for a kid
not to want to be down.

l know. l'm over here.

Nah, nah, nah.
l wanna show you something.

All right.
All right, sexy?

Stop with that.

<i># Closer to my dream #</i>

<i>[ Chaz ]</i>

<i>Where are they now,jail?</i>

<i>Most of them, or headed</i>
<i>that way like B.B., or dead.</i>

Listen, this is bad date talk.

We should change the subject.
What's your favorite color?

How come you turned out so good?

[ Chuckles ]
She thinks l turned out good.

l'm serious.
l don't know. l got lucky.

What happened?

Well, the guy that used to own this shop
lived right next door to me and my mom.

<i>And when he saw me</i>
<i>get into some bad things,</i>

he gave me a job here
sweeping up the floors.

lt's crazy 'cause
he couldn't even afford it.

He paid me right
out of his own pocket.

l worked for him for 1 0 years.

And when he passed,
he left this place to me.

<i>See, B.B. likes to talk shit</i>
<i>like l'm the one that's losing,</i>

like l'm missing something
out there on the streets,

but he and l both know who's winning.

l've found something that l truly love,
that truly makes me happy.

<i>And that's a million times better than</i>
<i>finding something that makes you rich.</i>

So, it's just someone believing in you.

Well, that and having a place to go
where l could stay out of trouble, yeah.

What?

Nothing.Just thinking.

About what?

About what makes me happy.

Well, you know, l would
really love to be a part of that.
What?

Making you happy.

All right?

l just don't have the time
to wait for people to wake up to that.

l'm gonna lose the building
at the end of the month.

lf l can't earn it, and l can't
borrow it, and l can't steal it,

l could raise it.
What do you mean?

Well, l'm trying to get
a space for kids, right?

lf people knew about it,
they'd want to help, wouldn't they?
Yeah, probably.

l could put on
a benefit performance.

Charge a cover.
Get some donated food.

Put on a great show. l could do that.
Why couldn't l do that?

'Cause l don't have a space,
that's why. Damn it!

Come here, <i>mami.</i> l got an idea.

That's love. Nah, baby,
l got you on my Christmas list.

All right? One, one.

lt's just off the B.Q. E.
lt used to be a church.

The cat l was just on the phone with,
he used to own it.

But in three weeks they're converting it
to office space, so it's empty now.

lf you want it, you better jump on it.

What's it like?

lt's dirty. lt's old.

But it has a floor, right?
Yeah.

l'll take it. Thank you.

Hey, guys.
Hi, Honey. What's up?

l know what you're thinking,
''What the hell we doing here?''
Don't worry, it's temporary.

This is what we call a means to an end.

Nobody's gonna give us a space,
that much is clear.

So we're gonna raise the money
and buy it, straight up and legal.

Y'all ever heard of a benefit performance?

What do you mean? LikeJerry Lewis?
<i>- Sort of.</i>

l'm Jerry. You're the kids.
Let's get to work.

<i>l spoke to your moms.</i>
<i>She said you're getting out tomorrow.</i>

That's right.

When you do,
l want you to come hang with me.

[ Scoffs ]
Nah.

You could have a good life, Benny.
lt doesn't have to be like this.

What do you know?
You ain't got no job.
You ain't got no money.

Matter of fact, you ain't got nothing.
What l got is a clear conscience.

Yeah? What you gonna buy with that?

lt breaks my heart seeing you
selling yourself short like this.

So leave. Get.

Let me ask you something.

You know your homies,
those guys that got your back?

Yeah?
How many times they come to visit you?

You think about that.

l don't know
if this is gonna work, Missy.

But, uh, nah, Katrina's gonna make this
so sexy, it's not gonna matter.

Katrina?
Who the hell is Katrina?

That's Katrina.
Hey.

Katrina is the shit.
She just did Ginuwine's new video.

l don't care if she just showed
MichaelJackson how to Harlem shake.

l said l want Honey.
Honey Daniels. Duh.

<i>Let's just try it once.</i>
<i>And if you like it, we keep it.</i>

lf not, then we fix it.
So there's no problem.

Let me see what you got.
What you gonna do?

l was thinking something a little more
sexy, maybe in the hips. Lenny.

<i>##[ Hip-hop ]</i>

No. No, no, no.
<i>- ##[ Stops ]</i>

What is this, this?
## [ Vocalizing ]

Look, let me tell you something.
l don't backup dance for Heather Hunter.

l don't know what kind of
pornography y'all got going on here.
This has gotta be a joke.

Anyway, when you get in touch
with Honey Daniels, you call me.

You, you need to call M.C. Hammer,
let him know you're stealing his stuff.

<i>Y'all two crazy people in here.</i>
<i>Give me my phone.</i>

<i>Don't make no sense.</i>
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

Missy, hold up. l got an idea.

Honey, what you been up to?

Bye, Michael.
Wait, come on.
Honey, come on.

Hold on. l came to apologize.
l'm not interested.

Give me a break.

What l did,

the way l handled things
was uncool, and l am so sorry.

Hey, and l want
to make it up to you.

ls that so?

l've got you three new jobs.

And you want me to do the choreography?

l am begging you.

Oh, l get it.

The artist asked for me, and
if you don't deliver, they're walkin'.

Am l right?

They want you, sure.
But so do l.

Michael, you got yourself
in such a bind.

Good luck getting out of it.

l'll pay. You know l got the money.

l don't want your money.

Are you sure?
You sure about that?

Because, uh, l could buy you
a little dance studio.

What about that? What about
you come back to work for me,

and l'll get you this.

You know what's funny?

When l first met you,
you were 1 0 feet tall.

And now l look at you,
you're this big.

l don't need your help. l'm gonna get
that dance studio on my own.

<i>[ Benny ]</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

Hey.

So you came.

l can't let these bustas get
in front of an audience doin' no--

That's wack.

<i>l'm gonna give you something better.</i>
<i>'Cause it breaks my heart to see you</i>
<i>selling yourself short.</i>

<i>[ Kids ]</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

Mrs. Strom, right?

Your friend came by the bank and

l do banking for some
nonprofit arts foundations.

Some rich people.

Some people who would find
the opportunity of funding
a project like yours very interesting.

Are you serious?
l've invited them tonight.

Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.

Don't thank me yet.Just go out
there and put on a good show.

How am l supposed to know
if l'm dressed right if you won't
tell me where we're going?

What you're wearing is fine.

Are you sure?
l'm sure we're late.

Where are we going?
l'm not telling.

You better tell me something.
l'm not telling.

Here you go.

Does the set look okay?
Yeah, it's cool.

l don't know. l feel like
l should've had brighter lights,
or a different backdrop, or colors.

l don't know. Here.

Yo, Honey. lt's good.
Just chill out. We got your back.

Now get out of here.
We got a show to do.

Wow.

You have no idea
how beautiful y'all look.

<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

This means a lot to me.

This means a lot to all of us.

These kids are good kids,
and, man, do they love to dance.

Dancing isn't what they do,
it's who they are.

And you coming here tonight
says you wanna get to know 'em.

That means more
than you could imagine.

<i>So, thanks again.</i>

Peace.

<i>And l hope you like it.</i>
