   Are you ready for a tale?

         A tale as old
    as the hills themselves?

They say the mountain is alive.

        It takes breaths
    from all that is living:

    the trees, the flowers,

           the grass.

        But the mountain
      is also unforgiving,

    and takes what it wants.

     It gives back nothing,

    not of its own choosing.

         It gives back
       only what escapes.

        But why, father?

           Long ago,

        the evil spirit
    fought the good spirit.

      The good spirit lost

         and fled west
       towards the ocean.

    The evil spirit hid here
        in the mountain,

        and never left.

     The white man believes

        the evil spirits
   showed themselves in 1846.

    The white man is wrong.

        Evil spirit came
   long before they arrived.

   And while the evil spirits
    quieted for many years,

     they did not go away;

          they slept.

We're almost there, girls.

    Ah, still a long winter,
            I know.

          We made it.

       Camp will be glad.

       You two did great.

           Good girl.

   We almost didn't make it.

        Blizzard's bad.

     Rations should last us
          the winter.

             Jacob?

           Elizabeth?

            Harriet?

      What in God's name?

            William!

      What are you doing?

   I have to say, I'm kind of
       digging my badge.

    Makes me feel important.

   Were you excited when you
        got your badge?

            Well...

      ...certainly gets me
        in the building,

     and after seven years
      of higher education,

 I also consider it my "get out
    of student loans card."

       Wow, seven years?

     I only went to school
         for two years,

  yet we have the same badge.

        Staff-Bright did
        give me 90 days

         to try you out
    and see if you're worthy

        of working here
     on a permanent basis.

I wouldn't worry about it, Eve.

         In actuality,
 everything constantly changes

     on a geologic scale...

  ...and on my bathroom scale.

 Maybe you should try switching

     to something healthier
         than burgers.

              Hmm.

 Well, that'd certainly be good
      for my cholesterol,

     but, I'm a carnivore,
        not a herbivore.

  Every now and then I need to
 eat something red and bloody.

   Reminds me I'm at the top
       of the food chain.

Yeah, well, I'm a yogurt whore.

  Reminds me that I don't like
        to kill animals.

Then why do we have incisors?

      I'd like to see you
          chase a deer

        and take it down
      with your incisors.

        I don't have to.
         We've evolved.

        I can use tools.

          Well, here.

       Why don't you use
      one of these tools.

      You got a little...

     I thought the volcano
          was dormant.

   It was, and now it's not.

       Looks like we have
       the potential for
     an explosive caldera.

           A caldera?

From the Latin word "calderia."

       Means cooking pot.

 Sometimes it's referred to as
  the English word "cauldron."

           Witchin'.

         What's in it?

  Ignimbrite, rhyolite, tuff,
    and other igneous rocks.

      That's quite a brew.

        When the gasses
    are under high pressure,

which they tend to--

   Yeah, a massive explosion
           of magma.

<i> ...so please make sure</i>
  <i> you take your pets with you</i>

         <i> as well as any</i>
     <i> necessary medications,</i>

  <i> and shut off any gas lines.</i>

      <i> The volcano eruption</i>
      <i> is expected any time</i>
       <i> from next week on.</i>

   <i> Again, this is not a test.</i>

    <i> Please stay tuned in for</i>
  <i> more news on the evacuation.</i>

       <i> We will now return</i>
        <i> to our regularly</i>
     <i> scheduled programming.</i>

           Hi, Mindy.

           You okay?

             Yeah.
         Yeah, just...

  ...going through everything,
            is all.

   Never easy just packing up
      and leaving, I know.

        It's just stuff.

   Well, most of it, anyway.

          That's cute.

      Well, look at this.

   Oh, hey, go Mountaineers!
        - Class of 19--

     Oh, don't say it, now.
   People'll think we're old.

 Hey, let me get that for you.

         Thanks, Mike.

       You, um- you move
      your family out yet?

             Uh...

         Rita moved out
       a few months ago.

           It, uh...

...didn't take a volcano warning
         for her to go.

    I'm sorry to hear that.

        Yeah, well, uh,

    at least she and Dillon
         will be safe.

             Yeah.

   You know, I'm glad to see
  you're heeding the warning.

  I wish I could say the same
            for Ben.

      My dad is how he is.

        Mindy, you know,
when Mount St. Helens went off,

  57 people lost their lives.

   A lot of those were people
     who refused to leave.

    I wish I could help you.

    My dad is more stubborn
      than my daughter is.

 At least she listens to me...

      ...some of the time.

    Well, I can imagine so,
            but I...

...need you to try and at least
   talk some sense into him.

       By staying behind,
     he endangers the lives
    of our first responders.

       Our rescue teams.

  You're just asking me to do
 something that can't be done.

 He doesn't change his mind...

        ...on anything.

  I need you to at least try.

      Now, I talked to him
   and he won't listen to me.

 I figured since you're family,
    you have a better shot.

           Some shot.

     He hasn't returned my
phone calls in ten years, Mike.

     Well, maybe it's time
     you paid him a visit.

      Maybe you're right.

         Thanks, Mindy.

  I- I could get that for you.

            Thanks.

 You know, I really appreciate
you checking up on us, and all,

    but don't you have some
     more important things
    you should be handling?

    I think Deputy Tisdale's
     got it under control.

        At least I hope.

    You and your dad are my
    last stops before I head
       down the mountain.

 Everybody wants the old codger
          to be safe.

           I got him.

        What is she... ?

             What?

        Sorry I couldn't
       get here earlier.

 Blue Betty doesn't do so well
    over 60 miles per hour.

    What are you doing here?

       I'm here to help.

You're not supposed to be here.

        You are driving
      right into disaster.

        It's dangerous.

        Not as dangerous
      as Blue Betty, huh?

        She's harmless.

  Well, maybe if you spent...

 ...your money on state school
     instead of art school,

you'd have two new cars by now.

   True, but now I can draw a
 really pretty picture of her.

       Plus, she's slow,
   so it saves me money on...

      ...speeding tickets.
        Right, sheriff?

   That sounds logical to me.

     Whose side are you on?

  Ryan, come say hi to my mom
      and Sheriff Denton.

     Uh, nice to meet you.

          You must be
    the comic book collector
   I've heard so much about.

     Normally, I don't like
  to reveal my true identity,

     but, yeah, that's me.

             Howdy.

             Howdy.

          As a lawman
      in these parts, son,

   let me give you two pieces
      of friendly advice.

          What's that?

        Don't say howdy.

            And two,

         you watch out
     for these two ladies.

       They are dangerous
       with a capital D.

      Girls, let's get off
         this mountain.

          Devil's Peak
     don't wait for nobody.

     And that includes Ben.
          You hear me?

        You and Grandpa
       are talking again?

<i>Again, the eruption is expected</i>

  <i> any time starting next week.</i>

   <i> All residents are urged to</i>
   <i> relocate to Prophetstown.</i>

       <i> Federal Emergency</i>
    <i> Management Agency, FEMA,</i>

        <i> will be handling</i>
        <i> the evacuation.</i>

     <i> For more information,</i>
 <i> please contact local offices.</i>

Lou, come in.

             Yeah?

      Our girl actin' up?

       Yeah, yeah, she is
      a little bit cranky.

    But then, if you ask me,
        not much more so

than a lot of the women in town
      at the garden club.

      Oh, you would know.

  You've been up there starin'
 at her for how many years now?

              Ah.

 More than I care to remember.

     Why don't you get down
        from there, Lou?

    Get over to a safe zone.

 Hell, got over to Prophetstown

  and get some of Carol Ann's
       famous apple pie.

    We'll take it from here.

   Ah, no, I think I'll just
 sit tight a little bit longer.

        Gotta stick with
       my old girl here,

       Mount St. Barbara.

 Nobody calls it that anymore,
    Lou, it's Devil's Peak.

        I never did like
      that touristy name.

  It's a lot cooler for a guy
to say he climbed Devil's Peak.

        Don't you think?

      Well, if you say so.

She'll always be Barbara to me.

 You know, lately, she's gotten
     to be a lot like you.

      Gettin' real ornery.

      Huffin' and puffin'
    for no apparent reason.

     There, there, Barbara.

    Don't you listen to him.

        He doesn't know
       what he's saying.

      He doesn't know you
        like I know you.

I know that sometimes you just,
              uh--

   Well, you just wanna take
  a little smoke, that's all.

       It ain't the smoke
       I'm worried about.

    What are your readings?

      This can't be right.

             What?

              Ow.

Let me try yours.

Sheriff, he--

            Nothing.

      We've gotta go, Eve.

        We've gotta go.
         - Okay, okay.

<i> Please proceed</i>
        <i> through the town</i>

       <i> by the designated</i>
       <i> evacuation routes.</i>

       <i> You will be given</i>
     <i> further instructions.</i>

       <i> Please proceed...</i>

Tisdale, come in.

       Go ahead, Sheriff.

 I checked in with the Roberts
   and they're clearin' out.

      Lou's keeping an eye
        on the mountain.

          I'll be back
      to the station soon.

          Sounds good.

   You can deal with the FEMA
    folks and the red tape.

     You know, you haven't
      signed my boot yet.

     Never heard of anybody
        signing a boot.

    You get a cast on there,
 and I'll break out my Sharpie.

         I'll write you
      a real love letter.

          Okay, boss.

 You know, maybe you shouldn't
        play rodeo clown
       in your off time.

             Maybe.

        Remember, you're
     in Northern California
         now, pilgrim.

        I need to get me
    one of them map things.

           Copy that.
          Denton out.

         Rodeo clown...

       Girls, you need to
        get out of here.

 Really, after all these years,
  that's all you have to say?

              Yep.

       Haven't you heard?

           Yes, Dad.

 We have at least another week
    before it's gonna blow.

 Well, then, I guess I got time
           for a hug.

       Come here, Nikki!

    Give your gramps a hug!

   Oh, you are just as purty
         as ever, doll.

             Whoo!

You just haven't changed a bit.

          Yeah, right.
    I've doubled in height.

    Well, I knew you'd grow.

      Too bad you weren't
        here to see it.

     Good to see you, too.

           You ready?
       We need to leave.

   Why don't you and I go in
       and have some tea

  and leave your mom and, uh,
      your friend out here

       to talk about us?

          You serious?

     You said I had a week
 before that damn thing blows.

I mean about leaving Ryan and I
           out here.

           Oh, that?

       Yeah, I'm serious.

           You know,

  you and Mom don't have to be
    so nasty to each other.

             No...

     ...I reckon we don't.

            Cheers.

    Mom did what she thought
           was right.

     She- she didn't know.

             Nikki.

   I don't wanna get into it.

    I remember coming here.

  You always had a pack of gum
        in the top shelf
       of that cabinet...

 ...which I could never reach.

 Well, not for lack of trying.

      You used to stack up
    everything in the place

    just to get at that gum.

     You can reach it now.
      Go on, have a piece.

           Just one?

    Nah, it's been too long.

   Have as many as you like.

      You used to make me
       sing or do a trick
 before you'd give me a piece.

             Well?

       You still got it.

      Place looks the same
         as I remember.

          Except this.

       You have an iPad?
       - I sure do, doll.

    I also tumble on Tumblr,
       Reddit, and tweet.

              Wow.

        I guess you can
      teach an old dog...

     All right, that's it.
    I'm gonna get me an app.

      I'm gonna teach you
         some manners.

     You know, I would love
 to follow "Old Ben's Friends"

       on one condition.

   What's that, Tweety Bird?

     You follow me and Mom
          outta here.

Is that the best offer you got?

    Or we can just sit here
            and talk

     until our fiery death
          by volcano.

  Because I'm not leaving here
          without you.

            Really?

            Really.

      What in the name of
 Stephen Hawking is she doing?

              Hey!

    You've got to evacuate!

The safe zone is ten miles out!

   Then you better get going.

           It's okay.
     I know what I'm doing.

I'm a professional photographer
         and a blogger.

          Yeah, well,
      I'm a volcanologist.

            A what?

 I'm telling you, this volcano
        is gonna erupt.

       He's not kidding.

             Right.
      Listen, don't worry.

     Just a few more shots
      and I'm out of here.

 Welcome to the Darwin Awards.

           And in the
   natural selection category

       the loser is her.

       Can we leave now?

  That's all you're bringing?

             No...

    ...personal belongings,
             no...

       ...family photos?

  It's all stored right here.

       What about Mom-- ?
        - In the cloud.

           Forget it.

           Let's go.

            Sheriff?

         Go ahead, Lou.

    Sheriff, I think I spoke
       a little too soon.

   Our old girl here, she's--
            I dunno,

     she's developing some
    black lung or something.

  She's spitting up more smoke
       than I've seen...

            ...ever.

           All right.
I'll check in with Dr. Stevens.

    Yeah, okay, roger that.

Lou, next time I hear from you,

       you better not be
      in that damn tower,

   or I'm gonna come up there
 and drag you out by your ear.

          You promise?

          I'm serious.
          You read me?

    Yeah, that's a big 10-4.

      How did I get stuck
      back here with you?

     Just ignore him, Ryan.

           It's okay.
        He's used to it.

       Ignoring people's
      what the does best.

   Still a wonderful driver,
             I see.

       Sorry about that.

  I saw something in the road.

     Yeah, or in your head.

   I think I saw a squirrel.

<i> ...coming shortly from</i>
     <i> FEMA representatives.</i>

       <i> Please stay tuned.</i>

          Easy, easy.
            Sheriff?

        Sheriff, this is
      Ranger Danger here.

  I'm getting ready to leave.

       Our girl is shake,
      rattle, and rollin'.

              Out.

          What the-- ?

     Sheriff, yeah, we got-
    We- we have this naked--

            Hold on!

      Well, look at that.

              Lou!

<i> We are under</i>
     <i> mandatory evacuation.</i>

      <i> Repeat, we are under</i>

 <i> All residents are required to</i>
<i>reach the designated safe zone.</i>

       <i> ...outside of town</i>
      <i> as soon as possible.</i>

              Hey!

              Lou?

              Lou!

         Mom, reverse!
            Reverse!

             Shit!

          Go, go, go.

Everybody out!

    We'll hoof it from here!

    I know a safe way down.

           Oh, my-- !

            Oh, my--
          Oh, my God.

   Can you hold on a second?

 Just please hold on a second.

       Sheriff, go ahead.

 Ranger McGee was in the tower
         when it blew.

       He didn't make it.

          Jesus, Lou?

  What's goin' on down there?

        It's a madhouse.

     You seen Mindy Roberts
         or her family?

         Nope, not yet.

     What about Dr. Stevens
       and his assistant?

            Nothing.
 Are you on your way back yet?

           Negative.
        Not until I know
        everyone's safe.

     They may be somewhere
      around here already.

   There's no sense in going
     on a wild goose chase.

You just continue with the evac
    and mind the old folks.

       Make sure they get
         on the buses.

           Yes, sir.
           I'm on it.

  You just get back here soon.

          Denton out.

             Shit.

            - What?!

  We gotta get out of the car
              now!

       You sure you know
      where you're going?

      I know this mountain
   better than I know myself.

    At least there's no sign
            of lava.

      I can say one thing.
      You were always good
         at keeping up.

            Careful.

     I might interpret that
        as a compliment.

 I might have meant it as one.

        I said I might.

             Yeah.

       Tisdale, come in.

       Sheriff, go ahead.

     You get any word from
      the Roberts family,

        or Dr. Stevens?

          Nothin' yet.

     How's everything going
          down there?

        People are just
      crowding into town,

 hoping this thing ends so they
 can get back to their houses.

     Let's hope they still
          have houses.

          Sheriff out.

You in the road, stop.

             Hello?

   You people can't be here!

  This area's being evacuated!

             Hello!

       Tisdale, come in.

        Tisdale, you got
       any other reports

    of any hikers or campers
   up here on this mountain?

  There's nothing in the logs.
           What's up?

        I dunno, I guess
     I'm just seein' stuff.

     The director of FEMA's
         riding my ass.

        I'm not getting
       off this mountain
 'til I'm sure everyone's safe.

 You handle things down there.

   Are you getting anything?

The blast must have knocked out
        the cell towers.

   We've gotta warn the town.

   I think they already know.

       No, that was just
       the initial blast.

   There'll be more tremors,

         and according
     to the readings today,

       the next eruption
     will be much stronger.

     Stronger than anything
        I've ever seen.

    It's a Palean eruption.
       A Palean eruption!

             What?

       A super eruption!

    The gasses are trapped,

  building up an extraordinary
      amount of pressure.

         The next blast
     will be catastrophic.

    I think they're- I think
  they're evacuating already.

   Not where they need to be.

    They're going only about
         ten miles out.

  The safe zone for this blast
      will be at least 20.

      - Come on, come on.
            - Okay.

     - Come on. Come here.
            - Okay.

    I'm sorry I brought you
           out here.

   I never imagined anything
 like this was going to happen.

           It's okay.
   It's good you brought me,
            though.

             Yeah?
          Why's that?

   'Cause I have superpowers.

           Oh really?
            - Yeah.

    What kind of superpowers
          do you have?

         It's a secret.

    Can I at least watch you
change outfits in a phone booth
           some time?

             Sure.
    I can make that happen.

  Okay, well, what about now?

   Like, can you burn my name
  into a rock with your eyes?

    That's your superpower?
       A bad somersault?

       No, my superpower
      is making you laugh.

       Come on, you two.
            Keep up.

      Where are you going?

            Problem?

    I swear I saw something.

       You two go ahead!
         Dad, come on!

  Go on, I'm slowing you down!
          - Dad, move.

      I'm not leaving you.

        Climb that tree!

              Dad!

      All right, come on.

   We gotta get to the cabin.

        Where are they?
 - Maybe they went another way.

       - I'm going back.
          - Whoa, no!

          To do what?

        Look for a gun!

            Got it.

      Are you kidding me?

             Wha--

              Yes?
      Keep the door shut.

  Wait, no, you keep it shut.
           I'm going.

No, if your mom comes back here
      and you're not here,
         she'll freak!

       Then she'll freak.
     - No! It is not safe.

I know, and my mom's out there!

         What the hell
       were those things?

        God only knows.

     You ever seen anything
       like that before?

        In all my years
      up on the mountain,

   I've never been acquainted
        with anything...

     ...remotely resembling
         those things.

        Makes me wonder.

            Wonder?
       What do you mean?

       Well that volcano,
        it swallowed...

       ...a lot of people
      back in the 1800's.

          Some say...
        - Some say what?

          Never mind.
    Let's just get to the...

       ...get to the kids
     and get to the cabin.

     Tell me they made it,
          right, Dad?

         They made it.
         They're fine.

  It's not even that far off.

           Trust me.
They're there, and they're fine.

            For now.
     We gotta get the hell
          outta here.

         Lava's comin'
    down the mountain fast.

          Just relax.
      - I'll relax when we
         find the kids.

           It burns!
         God, it burns!

          Oh, my God!

          Oh, my God.

              Dad!

          Oh, my God!

         Mom! Grandpa!
           This way!

      So what happens when
   the second eruption hits?

    From my calculations...

           God, what?

 Only a miracle could save us?

  I don't know about miracles
           or God...

    But hey, hey, hey, hey.

      If it's your thing,
        it's your thing.

          So, uh, um,

      do you like working
       at the institute?

       You know, I think-
    I think I could get you
      hired on full time.

   You know, benefits, 401k,
 free cake on your birthday...

           Free cake?
          - Free cake.

           I'm sold.

        What are those?

           Hey! Hey!

    Let's pick up the pace.

           That way.

     Go away from me! Run!

              No!

              Run!

              No!

       - Those things...
           - Things?!

         Hello! People!

 What we have here are zombies!

     Walking freakin' dead!

        So here's a tip:

         Don't get bit,
    or you become a zombie.

     - But they were oozing
          orange goo.
            - Yeah.

          I've been to
      horror conventions.

 I've seen a pig get mutilated
      by Scottie McDaniels
        in freshman Bio.

      I've seen a Klingon
 and a Stormtrooper get married

         to each other!

          But that...

 That was some creepy ass shit!

        Okay, I think...

     I think we should just
stay here for a bit and just...

      wait until those...
     things clear the area.

        Clear the area?!
        They're zombies!

       They could just...
            wander!

 Well, what about the volcano?

              I--

      Okay, the ash cloud
      is moving that way,

     towards the other side
        of the mountain.

    What if the wind decides
      to change direction?

  Then we suffocate in a giant
     black cloud of death.

 Okay, can we just try and keep
   it positive for a minute?

           Positive?

     What's positive about
        being chewed on
        by lava zombies?

   Dad, whose cabin is this?

 This is Arnie Tramer's place.
    Skittish as a squirrel.

 He took off from the mountain
      as soon as he heard
          the warning.

   What-- What are you doing?

 Trying to tap into his wi-fi.

    And this way, I can send
      a sheriff a message
        where we're at.

        You, young lady.

  You shouldn't even be here.

    You should be at school,
         but not here!

And leave grandpa alone to die?

   He would've stayed behind
     if it weren't for me.

      Lord knows you can't
         convince him.

   Not with your sassy atti--
           - Don't...

         Don't sass me!
            - Fine!

           All right.

        Should've known.

     The connection's out.

     Your wi-fi's not gonna
        receive a feed.

       Where does it go?

         It's outside.

       The blast must've
       knocked this out.

Can we fix it?

              Yes.

          What the...?

       - No, no, no, no!
     - The hell's going on?

       - Get in the car!
          - Hey! Hey!

           Watch out!

        Get in the car!

          Come on! Go!

            Go! Go!

What the hell was that?!
    - I don't know!

      Where's Dr. Stevens?

         They ate him.

             What?

              Hey.

       Now we're just...
            waiting.

       You could get off
        that thing now.

           Aw, shush.

      Or maybe you can't.

      Maybe you can't stop
        surfing the web.

          Maybe you're
      an internet addict.

   Well, why don't you stage
        an intervention?

          Don't start.

    No, that's a great idea.

You know, you can gather up all
 the family and all my friends,

     tell them that I have
     an internet addiction.

   While some soulless things
  are trying to eat us alive.

           And then,
    after everyone leaves...

...and I'm totally embarrassed,

          I move away.

  Forever, disowning everyone.

          Dying alone.

      That worked so well
         with Meredith.

           Why, hell,
    let's just try it again.

      I'll drink to that.

        She was my mom.

     I was trying to help.

       - Yeah, some help.
             - Hey!

Grandma had a drinking problem,
  and mom was trying to help.

             Fine!

  And I'm trying to help now.

 I'm gonna tweet my followers,
  send a word where we're at.

            Really?

       How many followers
          do you have?

              Two.

           Here, um,
   let me help you with that.

 I've never much liked croquet.

  Why don't you make something
           with this?

      I suck at whittling.

      Have Grandpa do it.

       You're the artist.

       Nothing I've done
       is worth anything.

      That's so not true.

  Everything you've made is...

         is worth more
     than you'll ever know.

           Come here.

            Tisdale.

      You should see this.

Sheriff, about the volcano...
 - <i> Sheriff, come in.</i>

     - ...Dr. Stevens was--
           - Hold on.

       Tisdale, go ahead.

    Sheriff, we got a Tweet
      from a Ryan Jacobs.

    Says he and the Roberts
         are held up in
     Arnie Tramer's cabin.

         What the hell
    are they doing up there?

     Says they're trapped.
 Says they saw some kind of...

       Volcano monsters.
         Yeah, I know.

    Well, they said zombie,
           but okay.

        How do you know?

      Well, I think I saw
          one of them.

   Listen, you stay put, I'll
 round everybody up down here.

         Wait, Sheriff.

       I could join you.
 I could lasso up a few folks,

     cut the time in half.

    I-- You're my point man.
   I need you to put on your
 pointy hat and start pointing.

           - Sheriff.
     - Sheriff, but I could
           help you.

    Tisdale, absolutely not.
 That's an order, you stay put.

           - Sheriff!
         - What, what?

        Dr. Stevens said
  that wasn't the main blast.

  The volcano's a lot stronger
  than he originally thought.

   The safe zone has to be...

at least another ten miles out.

   - Ten miles, you're sure?
          - Ten miles.

       Tisdale, come in.

  Sheriff, you're breaking up.
            Repeat.

     Tisdale, get everyone
       out of town, now!

 Evacuate them to Prophetstown.

          Do you copy?

   Sheriff, I can't hear you.

            Damn it.

      That when it blows,
 the top half of the mountain's
        gonna come off.

        It already blew,
     and we're still here.

  That wasn't the main blast,
       at least from what
         he was saying.

     Eve, I hate to put you
           in danger,

      but I'm not leaving
     this mountain without
      the Roberts family.

     Hey, I'm gonna head up
       to Tramer's cabin,

   - I'm right with ya, Hoss.
   - No, just keep everything
       going as planned.

  He ordered you to stay put.

         That's crazy,
   especially with your leg.

       Hey, I could still
  kick your ass with one leg.

         If you say so.

           I say so.

         Ah! Good news!
     Sheriff's on his way.

         Oh, thank God.

     Well, let's just hope
         that the curse

         of Donner Pass
        just isn't true.

       Curse? What curse?

      Dad, that's enough.

      N-No, I wanna know.

       Cherokees say that
    this mountain is cursed.

 Since way back before even the

   people died at Donner Pass
        back in the, uh,

        winter of 1846.

     Oh, the Donner Party.
       I know this story.

        How'd they die?

   Well, some by starvation,
         some by cold.

         Only 45 of the
     81 pioneers survived.

        That's horrible.

       Many of them, uh,

    resorted to cannibalism,

    in order not to starve.

        They ate the old
      and ate the infants.

      And over the years,
   it's affected all the rest

        of the settlers
       that's come here,

        either the curse
        or the mountain.

    The mountain spit forth

disease, despair, and insanity.

     And anything that was
        good and noble,

      the mountain twisted
      to its own evil way.

       It made life hard,

   not only for those people
      who tried to cross,

but for the trees, the animals.

     It let what it wished
       grow in its soil,

        to cover itself
         like a blanket

    against those who would
     discover its secrets.

          Pools boiled

    with the souls of those
        trapped within.

   And the mountain destroyed
        what it wished,

         with no mercy.

      They say even birds
         who flew over

would sometimes drop in flight.

    Their hearts stopped...

          ...in fear.

     Like the great shaman,

   the evil spirit could take
      possession of souls.

        Bring back life
     like a budding flower

    for those who perished.

    Loved ones who had lost
         would return,

        only different.

     What they brought back
        was no way good.

Some said the souls of the dead
          glowed red,

     like lava in the heart
        of the mountain,

       waiting to return
         to the living.

  That they only needed a push
       from the mountain.

     And whenever they got
          the calling,

      death would follow.

           It is said

     that every generation

        has a caretaker
        of the mountain,

   someone who looks over it,

          its watcher.

    Why doesn't the watcher
      chase the evil away?

 Only someone of great strength
   can defeat the evil forces

     and free the watcher,

so the good spirits can return.

      Who is the watcher?

             Mike.

      Everyone all right?

      Yes, but there's...
       things out there.

            I know,
        I saw them all.

    That lava's moving fast.
We gotta get to the fire tower.

         - Fire tower?
       - I've gotta warn
      the people in town,

I'll get better
        reception there.

  Step away from the vehicle.

        Stay behind me.

      You'll have to shoot
        for their heads.

  You've gotta be kidding me.

     Get back in the cabin.
  Everybody back in the cabin.

        Get back inside!

      Get-Get some towels!
      Get a first aid kit!

        I need a radio!

       Ryan, get online!
         Get some help.

      - Wait, wait, wait.
            - What?

    I have to warn the town,
 but I can't send people here.

   My daughter is here, Mike.
       Send people here!

            I can't!

       Why the hell not?

          The volcano.

  It's gone off twice already,
       but it's not done?

    No, those were nothing.

Eve works with Dr. Stevens, she
knows what she's talking about.

   Nothing? That seemed like
        something to me!

          Oh, my God!

    My God, it's spreading.

             Mike!

   I'm gonna draw them away.
           When I do,

 all of you just run like hell
          to your car.

       That's your plan?
     That's-That's suicide!

        Mike, tell him!
     - No, no, he's right.

      You take my cruiser
 and get the kids back to town.
       I-I'll cover you.

        Keep them safe,
   in case you run into more
of those damn things out there.

   Besides, if my baby here's
 driving, none of us are safe.

             Dad...

         - Stay still.
            - Don't!

      Tisdale, behind you!

           - Come on.
    - Let's go. Go, go, go!

            Nicole!

              Run!

        Get in the car!

            Get in!

        Get in the car!

    Will you see if there's
        a first aid kit?

   Let's look at that wound.

    Mom, it's getting worse.

    I don't know what to do!

          Ryan! Ryan!

           Let's go!
          Go, go, go!

Stop! Stop!

Is everyone all right?
 - Yeah, yeah.

   Get in the fire tower now.
          Go, go, go!

            Come on!

       Come on, come on.

         Come on, Ben.

         Almost there.

  All right, stay right here.
 I'm gonna go up and check the
tower for the radio, all right?

       Stay right there!

        Shuler, come in!
        This is Denton.
          Do you copy?

Shuler, come in!
        This is Denton!

          Do you copy?

       Go ahead, Sheriff.

       Gotta move people
      20 miles out, okay?

The blast zone is now 20 miles.
          Do you copy?

           20 miles?

         Yes, 20 miles!
 Get those people moving, now!

       Shuler, you copy?

             Allen!

   All right, everybody, run!

      Get up in the tower
    with the sheriff. Go on!

          - No, Dad...
I'll keep 'em away down here.

         Go on! Hurry!

            Come on.

  Everyone, top of the tower!
  Go, go, get up there! Move!

        Oh, my God, Dad!

         Get up there.

      Hit them with that!
  Mindy, where are you going?!

Dad!

              No!

   There's nothing we can do.

              No!

            Nicole!

      Hurry, hurry, hurry!

             Hurry!

        Wh-Where's Ryan?
         Where's Ryan?

         Where's Ryan?!

             - No.
             - No!

     You need to get down.
     Get down on the floor!

         Everyone down!
        It's gonna blow!

Sheriff, come in.

        Sheriff Denton,
          do you read?

 Is Burger Barn still standing?

       Sure is, Sheriff.

     Well, that's too bad.

      I hate Burger Barn.

We're glad
     you're still standing.

 Other than a few downed trees
 and a couple of wrecked cars,

  I'd say we dodged a bullet.

           Copy that.

       Boy, that was one
        hell of a ride!

              Dad!

              Hi!

         Are you okay?

   What the hell-- How the--

        How did you...?

         This mountain,
         she's like me.

 She's got a few cracks in it,

       and I stuck it out
       in a narrow cave.

  Oh, Ben, you wily ol' coot,
     you know you're gonna
     outlive us all, right?

Ah, well...

    I reckon that if I ever
    have to get stuck again,

        I'd like to have
      some family with me.

          What the...?

  Look at that, you got the--
     hair is just the same.

       I had you with me
        the whole time.

           Let's go.

     Wait, hold it, I'm not
  totally damaged goods here.

   Yeah, well, you've looked
    a hell of a lot better.

   Yeah? Well, who asked ya?

      And that is the tale
        of the mountain.

       Sometimes I worry
        that Night Wolf

       takes a little bit
       too much pleasure

   from scaring the children.

            I never.

       It's they who like
         being scared.

            Besides,

       it's the only way
         I can get them

to listen to tales of the past.

Some history lesson,

         teaching them
         about a curse.

 Well, I suppose better a curse
       than curse words.

    There are no curse words
   in the Cherokee language.

        I know, but you,

    you've gone and adopted
    the dirty English ones.

           Shit, me?

            Come on.
