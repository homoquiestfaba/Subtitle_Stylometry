Hello.

<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Hello.</i>

Yes.

You're a Libra,
aren't you, darlin'?

Yes, I'm a Libra.
Who's this?

<i>I'm Tia.</i>

Well, how did
you know that?

Can I please have
your first name only?

It's Emma.

Things always happen
for a reason.

Don't you agree?

Yes.

Love is in the air.

[ Chiming ]

I know this
doesn't make sense, but...

just wait and see, darlin'.

Hold tight.

They will return.

Have a good life, now.

Okay.

[ Woman ]
I'm finished.

She's all dressed.

That woman that just called,
she knew all kinds
of things about me.

What do you mean
she knew all kinds
of things about you?

Just stuff.

Who called?
Who was it?

She knew Mama just died.

She said...

she's gonna come back.

[ Snickers, Sobs ]

That's fucking--

That's fucking crazy, Emma.

What--
What does she mean?

She said to wait.

To hold tight.

And she'll return.

[ Woman ]
Love-15.

[ Ball Pounding, Bouncing ]

[ Woman Grunts ]

Ah.
Nice shot.

30-15.

I like that
the smoke from the fire
doesn't bother you.

Nope.

Doesn't bother me either.

Are you okay?

My grandma died.

Just today?

In there?

I'm sorry.

[ Engine Droning ]

Let's wait.

Please.

Just a few days.

I know.

She won't know my kids.

So what's the harm?

Karen's with someone.

She looks
more and more like Mom.

This isn't like you.

Do you like school?

I'm good
in all my classes.

I'm best in history,

which is weird
'cause I don't like it.

What don't you like about it?

I don't know if all
that stuff really happened.

Well, that's what
historians are for.

Is that
what you are?

Someday, maybe.

[ Emma ]
Karen!

Who
was that?

Ian!

You know what they say
about souls escaping
through open windows.

Tell me when it's safe
to come back.

Look, we're gonna have
a party for it.

You're creepy.

We could all use one.

Hey, it's me.

You alone?

You wanna smoke?

No, man.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

What's up with the A/C?
It's cold.

Yeah, I'll turn it down.

Looking at porn?

Not true.

You okay?

How's... your mom?

Hey, uh,

I'm sorry about
the other night.

What do you mean?

I don't care.
It's just not for me.

What's not for you?

You know.

I don't.

Whatever.

[ Man ]
Hey, what was here
before all the houses?

[ Man #2 ]

Shit.

Hello.
This is Angela Goren.

I'm calling about my mother.

This could make
the news, sweetie.

Most likely one
of those morning shows.

But, Mom--

Where's Daddy?

He's at home in the city.

Can't make it
for a couple of days.

Will they stop the fires?

I'll be in
in a little while.

Tomorrow...

we decorate.

Are you
expecting someone?

No.

Thankfully, she left
everything so organized.

Emma, I waited
for Karen to go to bed.

While I was sleeping?
You were gonna
let them take her?

Calm down.

What the fuck?
[ Screams ]

You didn't hear the voice.
Let me go!

What are you doing?

No! I'm not letting
them take her!

[ Angela Grunting ]

Last time, you didn't
listen to me...

about that fucked-up
fianc√© of yours,
and look where that got you.

You haven't been
touched in a year.

Can I help you?

[ Man ]
Angela?

That's my little sister.

She called.

About your mother
passing?

No, she hasn't.

I'm sorry.

She's having a hard time.

She wakes up thinking
it's already happened.

Is the hospice
nurse here?
That's me.

I know what they say
about family members doing it
despite qualifications.

[ Woman ]
That's none of our business.

I'm sorry.

We understand.

You've never
done that to me.

Yes, I have.

Maybe 20 years ago,

when we were playing.

I'm going to town tomorrow.

And when I get back,

she should be gone.

I only have
a few days here.

I shouldn't drink around you.

What's Henry think
of all this?

Have you told him?

Told him that his wife
suddenly believes in magic?

You weird fucking loser.

You take care of dead people.

You took care
of Mom.

Look at me.

I bet you didn't
even know it was her...

until she fucking died, right?

Tell your
lucky husband whatever,

but tell him
he needs to get here.

Tell him
we have a lot of work to do.

I need Mom's computer back
to do it.

<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Hello. Angela.</i>

[ Phone Beeps ]

Hi.

I saw you with my niece.
[ Laughs ]

Yeah.

She told me
about her grandma.

Sorry.

They're her favorites.

My mom
didn't like sweets.

It seems the healthiest
people get it.

You knew she was sick?

Karen said.

Hmm.

Well, she ate well.

Other things
were harder.

My died dad, and...

she always sort
of missed him.

Were they soul mates?

Nah. They should
have got divorced.

I'm Ben.
Angela.

I'll tell her
you say hi.

Tell her
the history student.

Thanks.

[ Woman On Radio ]
Two of those
are in Southern Oregon.

The wildfire burning
in Central Oregon
has forced the evacuation...

of the Black Butte
Fire Lookout Station,

<i>according to the Central Oregn</i>
<i>Interagency Dispatch Center.</i>

Black Butte Two fire was
reported early this morning.

It's burning
on the southeast slope
of Black Butte.

<i>The fire is about a mile</i>
<i>and a half north of Black Bute</i>
<i>Ranch near Sisters...</i>

and has grown
to about 300 acres now.

A spokesman
from the dispatch center...

says it appears that
lightning caused the fire.

A federal team
out of Central Oregon
are being sent...

Hey!
to help battle this blaze.

Hey! Ben!

You wanna look at Mars tonight?

It's closer to the Earth
than it's ever been.

Okay.

Let's do that.

Besides, I don't know
what else to do.

It'll never reach us.

It's her dad.
And she just lets go.

<i>[ Train Whistle Blowing ]</i>

[ Ben ]
Did you grow up here?

[ Angela ]
Yeah, in the summers.

My mom and my little brother
moved here full-time
after my dad--

Did you know
that this whole area
is a-- is a dried-up sea?

Oh, yeah?

I did my research.

My dad's been trying
to get me to visit
for a while.

What do you do?

Study rocks,

more or less.

Ah, just make us
feel super puny.

I don't know
why I thought
we'd be able to see it.

I had a dream today
after we met.

[ Clears Throat ]
I took a nap.

We met today, right?

So, uh, Barbra Streisand
was on Oprah,

and she was crying,

and...
she confessed to the world
that she had full-blown AIDS.

And--
[ Laughs ]

And Oprah took her hand,
and she said, "So do I."

And they were both
just totally crying.

And right after
she said it, she--

She was crying so hard
that she farted.

And I--

This really sad moment
became really funny
for everyone else.

And--
[ Laughing ]

What's that mean?

Oh!

I just--
I thought it was--

[ Bottle Clatters ]

Did they, um,
take your mom?

Yeah.

Hey, this is weird, but--
Will you give me something?

Give what?

Something from your niece.

There's only one.
Do you wanna share it?

Uh, yeah.

Like what?

What do you mean?

Um--

I'm making her something.

What for?

She struck me.

[ Bottles Clinking ]

Something that maybe
she used to really like
and then forgot about.

We have this too.

Her first toy.

Can I have it back?

[ Light Switch Clicks ]

Sweetie, time to get up.

Will you hang out with me

and you've got me stealing.
