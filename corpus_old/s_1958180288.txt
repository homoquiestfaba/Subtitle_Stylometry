<i>BARRY ALLEN JUNIOR FORENSIC TECHNICIAN</i>

Excellent day.

<i>LOW CALORIES</i>
Yes, thank you. You too.

Good morning. What am I going to give you?

Where is curly hair lady?

Sarah?

She's sick, or at least that what she says.

She's got a new boyfriend.

What can I get you?

Usually it's my usual

and usually she has it ready, because usually I'm already late.

Well, don't keep me in suspense.

It's a PB and BRHC on a bun.

Okay, so PB would be peanut butter, I guess?

Yes, and BR bananas and raisins,

H would be honey, and C cheese, all served on a bun.

Are you blessed with a fast metabolism.

Are you running a marathon or something?

You know, my sister ran a marathon once,

God rest her soul.

She's not dead.

She's just exhausted.

We get it, Sharon. You ran.

But everyone has to work in the morning.

Yes, I have to go to work.

I have three minutes to go

and sorry, i'm in a bit of a rush for the sandwich.

You can't rush a good sandwich, dude.

ALFRED

Alfred, I really can't talk.

Good morning, Mr. Allen.

No, I'm late.

And I'm starving, and the curly-haired girl isn't here,

and her name is Sarah, and she has a boyfriend.

We have a situation at the Gotham General.

A robbery gone wrong.

It's in the middle of the morning.

Why is our bat-friend even awake?

Call Superman.

That was the first thing I thought.

Currently, he is otherwise engaged.

<i>VOLCANO ERUPTS IN GUATEMALA</i>

Classic.

What about Diana?

My other first thought.

It's rather annoying that she is not picking up.

How many first thoughts exactly did you have...

before your first thought was of me?

<i>It's never about her. 
It's about me.</i>

I am sorry, is my sandwich ready?

<i>I learned my lesson on the boat last year.</i>

<i>The things my sister hangs out with, when she's drunk.</i>

<i>Also personal comments about my mother's friends,</i>

<i>which seems normal to me.</i>

Oh my god!

Flash!

Hi. 
I love you!

Thank you.

You seem very nice also. 
Oh my God!

Pass you into Mr. Wayne.

Oh, please don't.

Sorry if this sounds weird

but are you actually eating that candy bar?

Maybe you could throw it to me.

In the name of justice. 
Yes, yes.

I need you here now, Barry.

Hi Bruce. Yes,
I'm...

coming.

<i>GOTHIC CITY LIMIT
GOTHAM COUNTY LINE</i>

<i>HOSPITAL EXIT 6.5 KM away.</i>

No!

Hey... No, no. No!

Bruce, this is a huge mess.

Why aren't you here?

Bruce, why does it sound
like you're fleeing the scene?

Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

He put a crew together and broke
into the lab of Gotham General.

Stole a highly deadly virus.

I intercepted them, but they 
blasted their way off.

You can handle the hospital, Barry.

Somebody has to save the rest of
the world, so I was going to do that.

You don't mind.

Sounds about right, Bruce.

<i>BRUCE MUTED</i>

"Thanks for saving me from the sinkhole, Flash."

Barry, the gas and water pipes ruptured.
In the basement.

Right.

On it.

Can you open it?

It's stuck.

Nothing works, please.

My God!

Let's see, Alfred.

I have come to accept
that I am essentially the...

Janitor of the Justice League, 
which sucks,

But I've come to accept it.

But, I can't help but notice, 
that always...

It seems to be a Bat-mess,
that I'm cleaning up.

STOP

Yes, I know right?

Look out!

If my calculations are correct, and
history will prove they usually are,

the foundational damage is about to
cause the collapse of the East Wing.

East Wing is fine.

Which is good, because my speed is lighting.

<i>LOW CALORIES</i> 
Running on empty, Alfred.

Do you hear that? That's my stomach.

No no. 
It's the collapse of the East Wing.

Barry, thirteenth floor.

There's a...
 baby.

A Shower

<i>CRITICAL</i>

<i>PEAK ENERGY</i>

<i>THERAPY DOG</i>

Mr. Allen, you've made me very proud.

And a lot of mothers very happy.

OK.

I understand that these events
can leave psychological scarring.

You should seek the services
of a mental health professional.

The Justice League is not
very good at that right yet.

Trust me.

Shake him off!

If that briefcase falls into the water...

It could wipe out half of Gotham by lunchtime.

Don't let go of me!

Oh God, no please! 
Please don't!

I'm sorry I'm late.

Watch your step.

Hi. 
Hey.

Nice suit.

Looking good, Flash.

Well I think...

And you... 
you're welcome.

My ego is far too big to say
thank you to someone else.

I developed this all-powerful persona,
to compensate for my childhood trauma.

I too have childhood traumas.

The Lasso of Truth... 
never gets old.

I would do much better
just giving my money away.

Instead of want to end crime, 
I should end poverty.

I know sex exists. 
I've just never experienced it.

Well, I have to run. 
Yeah.

Always a pleasure.

The sex thing was a metaphor for Gothic literature.

There's no way to recover from that.

Just let it go.

I'd really love to stay and clean up more mess,

but, this little superhero needs his breakfast.

Goodbye, Flash.

Yeah, bye-bye, Batman.

Well done, Mr. Wayne.

Will you be home for breakfast, Sir?

Yes, I think so.

The world is in destruction.

This was never about her.

This is about you.

You have to stop living in the past.

Was that fast enough for you?

<i>RESEARCH CENTER</i>

Look who's here.

Shut up, Robert.

Every day.

I don't know how you do it, Barry.

Would you like crawl here, bro?

Is he mad?

You're getting fired. 
You're getting murdered.

No no no. Let me guess.

Your alarm clock didn't go off.

Your dog ate your alarm clock.

Your alarm clock ate your keys.

The keys' grandmother died,

And they need a personal day.

It wasn't any of those things. 
What was it this time, Barry?

It was something else.

It was far less outlandish,

and I know I missed the meeting,

but i still really liked him to
to present these case files...

for potential review.

I think we rush these cases.

We have to reopen them. 
Rush?

We got a backlog six months deep...

And you want us to move slower?

You need to focus your motion.

Do the work. 
Close the case.

Move on.

You have a lot of potential, Barry.

You shouldn't still be getting coffee

after all these years.

You're right. That, that's true.

Go get me a coffee.

With 2 sugars?  
-Oh ya.

They gonna love this.

I am very satisfied with the ruling in the Johnson case.

The evidence, our lab analyzed...

was more than sufficient, to be conclusive...

We are still working at on the tests.

By constant diligence, hard work and concentration...

Barry was still working on that evidence...

If that was up to you,

<i>RESEARCH CENTER</i> 
we still would be scraping Ted Bundy's molars.

Do you know what?

I'm so happy you find this all so hilarious,

But we are dealing with real people lives.

people's families,

And I don't think they can grasp the gravity of it,

so why don't you leave me alone?

Barry Allen?

Iris West.

You know my full name also?

Yes. From school.

Barry, you didn't tell us you had a friend from school.

We didn't actually know that Barry had a friend.

Yeah, what does that make you now?

One? 
One.

You guys...

And bye, guys.

Okay, old friend.

They're not really my friends.

They are my work friends.

So you work here?

Yes, I do.

God, it's been a long time, huh?

I feel that we saw each other 
a few years ago, right?

No, because we haven't seen each other since college.

Maybe I was just thinking about you.

I am really glad I ran into you.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Your father's appeal is tomorrow, right?

Yeah, how...

Sorry, how do you know about that?

I'm covering it for the paper.

How is he holding up?

Are, are you asking me for the paper?

No, I'm asking as a friend.

Although, I'm sure the public would want to know as well.

Well, my only official comment is that my dad is innocent.

Right.

No one would want to believe that their father killed their mother.

What do you mean <i>believe</i>?

My dad shouldn't be in jail. 
My mom should be alive.

It's not about what I believe.

It is about what the truth is.

Right. 
No, yes, that's...

Oh my God, that's what I meant.

Right.

Sorry, I have no official comment at this time.

<i>CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL</i>

You have a collect call from Iron Heights Penitentiary.

Do you wish to accept? 
Yes.

Hey, Dad. 
Hey, Barry.

How are you doing? 
I'm fine.

Do you get out a lot? 
Yeah.

Well no. 
No.

But, I ran into an old college friend, 
Iris West, today.

Didn't you have a monster crush on her?

Well, if she doesn't have a boyfriend...

Why don't you ask her out?

Dad, I had a friend run the...

old security camera footage...

from the store
through this new program he's developed.

And it's crystal clear now.

It's just...

You never look up, dad.

You can't see your face.

So without new evidence to support your alibi,

We'd better start thinking about...

the next appeal. 
No.

You need to stop worrying about your old man.

If you did that, you might
actually have time for a girlfriend.

Dad, I don't want...

You've done this before.

This this was a last ditch effort, 
and we'll go through the motions tomorrow.

I'm fine, really.

You know, sometimes I even think it's probably...

easier for me to be in here, than out there,

without her.

So I can imagine, that she is alive.

Out there, living her life.

Barry.

Barry?

Are you there?

Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

Hey, you remember the sauce you make on Sundays?

The whole house smelled of basil and tomato.

She put on my sweats and start singing.

Yeah, but what was that song?

<i>What was that song?</i>

Remember that part.

It's not fair. 
What's not fair, monkey?

This question is stupid.

How many calculations can
you think of with an answer of 24?

There are bajillion answers.

How am I supposed to fit them all in?

You are right.

There are a bajillion answers to that question.

Not every problem has a solution.

Sometimes you just have to let go.

Keep your brain at rest and help me make the pasta.

Come on.

No. <i>Mierda</i>.

Henry?

Yes, <i>cariÃ±o mÃ­o</i>.

I need you to do me a favor.

I don't do favors.

OK.

Barry needs you to do him a favor.

Barry. Yes, anything.

I need another can of tomatoes.

You have a can of tomatoes.

I need another one.

I thought you guys went to the store this morning.

But I forgot the tomatoes.

This looks way more fun.

Let's just let Barry go to the store.

You drive, don't you, silly? 
What?

You are now so big, you can do anything.

Look at you.

You're getting gray, actually.

The green can, not the blue one, okay?

Got it. The blue can

Not the green one, right?

No! 
What?

The green can, not the blue one.

Good God!

It start singing.

Run!

Run Barry!

<i>â™ª El codo que aquÃ­ les traje â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Y del mensaje de mi canciÃ³n â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª La vida te da sorpresas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sorpresas te da la vida â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ay, Dios â™ª</i>

Look at you.  Yeah.

I love you, monkey.

I love you more.

I loved you first.

Nora?

Barry.

Leave it, there.

Barry!  Barry!

Call 911, now!

<i>Barry, Barry.</i>

<i>Don't worry about tomorrow.</i>

<i>We always knew it was a long shot.</i>

"Dad"?

<i>Your call with Iron Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.</i>

No!

Barry Allen?

You have to focus on what you know.

Was that fast enough for you?

...fast enough for you...

Are you saying that you went back in time, like in Pozharnov?

Yes, as in Pozharnov, except that in Pozharnov it was a second,

this time I went back a whole day.

So let's imagine, that it is in fact possible for you run faster...

than the speed of light, and so doing, travel back in time.

It still would be wildly irresponsibe.

I knew you were going to say that.

Yes, because Barry, if you were going to the past,

any interactions you have with your parents or yourself,

You step in the wrong blade of grass

You have no idea of â€‹â€‹the consequences that could be.

No. I know, the butterfly effect, right?

Yes.

I get it, but Bruce, I can fix things.

You can also destroy everything.

I can save her.

I can save them both.

Save your parents.

Barry, these scars that we have, they make us who we are.

We are not made to go back and fix them.

And there's nothing broken in you that needs to be fixed.

Take that from an old guy that has made a lot of mistakes.

Don't live in your past.

Live your life.

Don't let your tragedy define you.

What if it supposed to define me?

Your tragedy made you a hero.

It also made me a loner.

We could hang out.

Do you want to go get a bite?

I'm still hungry.

Not this time.

Maybe some other time.

Yeah.

Nice ride.

You have fancy friends.

It was an Uber.

Exec.

Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the case at all.

I am not here as a reporter.

Can we talk?

Come on in.

I'm not gonna lie, it's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

Yeah? 
Yeah.

Yeah, well, I'm a pretty tidy person.

Can I offer you a drink?

Sure.

I'll take a beer.

Beers, beers, beers.

I keep them in my fridge.

Thanks.

Look, I feel really bad about earlier.

I should have been more sensitive.

And I could probably have been less sensitive.

I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through.

It's like you lost both parents in one day.

Yeah, I did.

I lost my mom in a tragedy,

and I lost my dad due the failures of the justice system.

Is that why you got into criminal forensics?

You're trying to fix the system?

Yeah.

Yeah, to fix it.

There's gotta be a way to fix it, right?

I mean, that's why I also got into journalism to.

I could make it right, if I just could go back somehow

and warn them, without them knowing that I have warned them.

Thinking like that...
drive you crazy.

If I could just go back in time and stop the guy who did it...

No, I can't do that, because that's way too much interaction.

My dad wasn't even at home.

My mother sent him to get a can of tomatoes.

I think whoever broke into the house thought it was empty,

but then my mother was in there, with a knife in her hand,

and things turned bad, just an absurd chain of events.

And it's like this footage should
have finally supported my dad's alibi

but instead, three lives ruined by a can of tomatoes.

Oh my God!

What?

Well, that could be it.

If my mother doesn't forget about the tomatoes in the first place,

so he never leaves and she never dies.

No one even would have to see me.

Bruce said no interaction. This is no interaction.

This is just quick in, quick out, back to the present,

like I was never even there, and that's how I'll fix it.

Oh my God, Iris. 
Thank you so much.

This has been great.

I'm sorry. I have to leave. 
Okay, bye.

By the way, I had a really great time. 
We should do that again.

Kal-El. The son of Krypton.

This is a bad idea.

That defines you.

Your dad is a murderer.

<i>NORA ALLEN BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER</i>

Now!

<i>TOMATO PURÃ‰E</i>

Hi Mom.

Don't forget the tomato.

See you soon.

Please let it work.

<i>â™ª Happy birthday, Barry â™ª</i>

Thank you mom, for being here.

Thank you.

<i>Â¡QuÃ© susto, monkey!</i>

What are you wearing?

Is that Barry? And he is early?

What universe is this?

You cut your hair.

Now I can see your eyes.

It looks terrible.

Henry! 
You look old.
You look beautiful, baby.

What are they doing to you over there?

Leave him alone. He's perfect.

Come here.

I love you so much.

I love you too.

I love you more.

I loved you first.

Go take a shower and change.

You smell like feet.

Go Go go.

Old?

Seriously?

No, I mean like mature.

At that age you want to look older,

you know, gets into the bars that way.

How can I help?

Mom, how was your day?

Or your month?

Or the last 18 years?

That's a weird question.

Because I was here.

But, obviously we share those memories together.

Or I don't know...

Maybe we'll make new memories.

Like going to the aquarium or the circus...

or to the park and you push me on a swing.

That's also weird, because now I'm an adult...

so I probably power my own movement on a swing.

So how was it this week?

How is school?

The school is going well.

The school is very good.

I am working very hard there on my studies.

Did you asked out that girl from Economics?

I know Freshman Year is...

About going out, meeting people, okay?

Exploring things.

To experiment.

But, you have to be very careful.

Oh, shit.

I have to shit.

Outside.

Help!

Why are you here?

What year is it?

No no no no...

That is my face.

You stole my face?

I'm having a mushroom flashback?

Is that a thing?

How old are you?

18.

This is mad trippy.

So we are like in the future.

No wait. This is not trippy, dude.

This is catastrophic.

And no, we are not in the future.

I was supposed to be back in the present...

but I'm still in the past.

And there aren't supposed to be two of me.

You and I, we're not supposed to occupy...

the same reality at all, let alone interacting.

I can't believe I'm a time traveling superhero.

No no no.

You are not anything.

Which is good. You don't want to be a superhero.

It's scary and bug spider get stuck...

on teeth, all the time.

Awesome.

Do that thing again.

No, you don't have time.

Mom!

What are you doing? 
Now are you going to accuse me?

Do the thing!

Fine.

Yes.
Happy?

Yes. Now undo it.

Barry, are you okay up there?

We're fine. I'm fine.

OK.

So, you have like a plane that goes underwater...

or a boat that can fly?

How old are you, like 40?

Okay, you don't stop talking.

It's not charming, it's abrasive

and exhausting and oh my god,

I starting to realize what people mean.

Just do me a favor

and promise me that meeting me...

Isn't gonna screw up space-time.

Brosky?

I got you.

Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

What do you mean?

That's right.

I can drug you.

Yes, I can drug you.

And then you pass out, you wake up

and you forget that anything ever happened

And it wouldn't be wrongd, right? Because you are me.

No! We should not.

Please don't drug me.

No? 
No...

Because here is the thing I've thought about before...

I don't want to get drugged, but I'm sure we can think...

of another way.

Let's put on our Barry thinking caps

and let's think of a different solution for memory loss.

Also, I am a green belt in Quera

and I have extensively studied wrestler

And I could go lunatic on you.

Besides, I have a date tonight.

OK.

How hard do you have to hit someone to make them forget stuff?

If I hit you in the past...

Will it hurt me in the future?

Wait, did you say you have a date tonight?

Yes. Wait, what were you doing there?

Nothing. Who's your date with?

With a super babe in my econ class.

Iris West.

My God, do we marry her?

You're going on a date with her tonight.

That's why I need mom to do my laundry.

You don't even do your own laundry?

Do you?

OK.

I'm actually going to go. 
What do you mean?

Enjoy your life or do you.
Change literally nothing.

I'll see you again never.

But I have some more questions.

We have a lot to learn from each other.

Great.

You leave me and now this storm is going to ruin my date.

What day is today?

Sunday?

No, the date.

It's September 29.

Shit.

This is the storm, this is the day.

What day?

The day I got my powers.

The day you get your powers.

Powers?

Listen, I can't tell you why I traveled back in time time.

And I can't tell you what I changed.

But essentially, in my version of reality,

I ended up interning at the Central City Crime Lab.

in my Freshman Year.

That's where it happened.

Happened.

Tonight, September 29, the accident that gives me my powers.

And if you're not there in...

30 minutes,

then you won't get your powers.

Which means I won't get the powers,

maybe,

and then, that would mean I lose my way...

to go back in time, in the first place.

And then I literally have no idea what happens.

Powers?

Wait, but what will happen to our date tonight?

She might be our future wife.

There may not be a future

if you don't come with me...

right now.

<i>CENTRAL CITY RESEARCH CENTER</i>

Eight minutes.

How are we going to get inside? 
What are you doing?

Stop whining.

It's going to feel kind of weird.

We go through the door.

Yes.

It's okay. It's called phasing.

Come on.

I love phasing.

Everybody moves.

Well, this is it.

This is where I was sitting.

And actually, let me take this...

for you. 
Thank you.

Okay, I just opened those windows...

to clear the fumes.

We are right on time.

And I was sitting in that chair

and it was right under this shelf of chemicals

and that was when the lightning hits.

Wait, I get hit by a lightning?

No no no. You won't get hit by the lightning.

Okay, because for a second I thought you said...

The lightning hits the chemicals, with which you get...

bathed and that's what electrocutes you.

Okay, but I don't wannabe electrocuted.

No. No, you already have. I already have the powers.

You already have the powers.

Exactly. 
I'm not geting struck...

by lightning.

It worked.

Looks like you've lost a tooth.

No?

You have lost a tooth.

Very good.

We have to go.

What happened?

The alarm, upstair from the lab.

Go check it.

Securing the entrance.

We have to go.

Hey.

Shit!

I'm slow.

Why is your place so much nicer...

than I expected it to be?

Do you like it? Mom had to help decorate.

You know mom.

Right. Yes. Classic mom.

Classic mom.

What a day

Barry, the accident gave you powers,

but took mine away.

So, I don't know how I get back.

Without access to the speed force, I don't know...

how I ever leave.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

I may be stuck.

Wait.

I have powers now?

Yes, but...

Oh, speed balls.

OK. I know this is incredibly exciting,

because I went through it...

Speedy Gonzalez.  Yeah.

I've done it many times myself.

You can't just start...

Shit!

Oh my god!

I'm leaving!

What did you do?

Nothing. Why?

Barry, let me tell you about the clothes.

It's friction. you run too fast

and therefore, normal tissues are burned.

It's the same reason you can't move people very far...

at hyperspeed. That broccoli looks rotten.

Look, some things can be moved.

For example, you can move

a microwave.

But you can't move something like, say,

a baby. 
Barry, it's like...

I had never eaten anything before.

Everything has vivid flavor.

Well. Take a bite.

That's bad, isn't it?

That's not good. No, I was kidding.

Amazing. We are amazing.

And I'm very hungry.

Hey, wait.

I wanna try that phasing thing.

How do I do that? 
You don't.

Not yet. okay? It's very complicated.

It takes a long time to train your body...

to be able to speed up, while your molecules...

slow down enough to pass through the molecular...

structure of solid objects.

You've got to start let me finish...

my sentences.

Are we always so sleepy

and hungry and naked?

Well, the first two, yes.

The third, no. I figured...

that part out. And honestly...

if we gonna do this, there's a lot I am gonna have...

to explain to you. So, a good place to...

start, I guess, is that...

yes, the original soup...

it was actually made of this poly...

Or we'll...

pick this up tomorrow.

So the suit is inside the ring.

Yeah. 
What?

Am I going to have this?

No, you can't have it. You can...

borrow it, so you don't kill yourself using your powers.

My God!

You're going to press this button and the silk molecules go...

to uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases and expanding...

the suit in full size. Ready?

He was so little, brother.

You have to put it on, before it falls to the ground.

What, how to change?

Right here, in front of you? - There's not even anyone here...

How are you, Barry.

Man.

Tight.

It hurts. Do you know where it hurts?

In my dick. 
Okay, I know...

I know, but I don't need to know. 
I'm sorry, can we move on?

Here's what I am thinking.

If I can train you to move like I do,

then we can recreate the chronospace.

Chrono space? - In the speed force.

Speed force.

And then maybe we can find some way...

so I can go back to the future. 
Back to the Future!

Yes! Eric Stoltz is your boy...

in that movie. What a embodied performance.

You mean Michael J. Fox?

Back to the Future?

Yes, in the movie Back to the Future.

My God!

What's going on?

You have to take this suit off now.

Thank God!

A mysterious object is hovering over...
<i>A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT FLYS OVER THE EARTH</i>

the Australian seaboard
<i>A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT FLIES OVER EARTH</i>

We have obtained images... 
Zod.

And as you can see...

Zod.

What is a Zod?

<i>Thanks to US government officials,</i>

<i>satellite data has confirmed...</i>

<i>the presence of a spacecraft.</i>

<i>Will be...</i>

<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

<i>I come from a world far from yours.</i>

<i>For some time, your world...</i>

<i>has sheltered...</i>

No. 
<i>- To my citizens.</i>

This can not be happening.

Not now.

What is happening?

Zod is looking for Superman.

What is a Superman?

Superman is an alien living on Earth.

I'm assuming he's still incognito.

But, yes. He is an alien and...

it is very powerful and he is just the best.

And then Zod, he's an alien from the same planet,

also very powerful, but he is just the worst.

And Zod, came here to find Clark.

Wait, who is Clark? 
Clark is Superman.

OK. 
But then Zod, also tried...

terraform the planet with that world engine thing

and Superman stopped him eventually,

but not before Zod killed the thousands...

of people.

At that time, there was nothing I could do.

Wait.

You were there?

Yeah. I just got my powers.

<i>I was still putting the finishing touches on my suit.</i>

<i>This thing, Zod's world engine,</i>

<i>it started to destroy Metropolis,</i>

<i>so I just went there</i>

<i>and I started trying to save people.</i>

Daddy!

Listen to me!  Escape!

Run away!

<i>There is this kid,</i>

<i>and I got him, but then...</i>

<i>I couldn't get his dad.</i>

Daddy!

<i>That was all I could do</i>

<i>to save that one kid.</i>

Only Superman could stop Zod,

but not in time to save those people.

And now it's about to happen again.

But...

if I can find the entire Justice League.

Superman and the rest of the gang, I...

maybe then I can prevent all this from happening at all.

Give me your laptop. 
OK.

What is that smell?

It could be anything.

Who is that?

It's Gary.

That's where the smell comes from.

Don't worry, he's busy.

We can do it.

Let's see. Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

That's my roommate, Patty.

Is Patty is your roommate?

And that's her boyfriend, Albert.

What's up?

Good morning.

Sorry. And, guys,

this is my cousin,

Barry.

I'm starving.

OK.

Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

Yes, here he is.

Victor Stone, star quarterback of The Knights...

Shit, okay.

Not the Cyborg yet.

Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman.

Las Vegas residency.

Illusions, juggling and zebras.

No, that is not Diana.

Aquaman. 
Aquaman?

Is he like a super mermaid?

No, Albert. He's not a super mermaid.

Okay, he's half Atlantean, half human...

With superhuman strength, he can control marine life...

with his mind.

So I guess that makes him a super merman?

No, Albert. 
Can you believe this guy?

Let's try Arthur Curry,

Maine,

Lighthouse

Here we are.

Thomas Curry. That's his father.

Phone.

Hello. 
Hello, Thomas Curry?

Yes. 
Could I speak to Arthur?

Is Arthur around?

Do you wanna speak to my dog?

What? No no.

Sorry.  Is this Thomas Curry?

<i>Yes</i>

And you work in a lighthouse?

Yes. 
OK.

And your wife is the Queen of Atlantis?

No...

Right, but maybe a fishlike woman washed into your life...

at some point?

<i>Very funny, asshole.</i>

Arthur Curry was never born.

What?

This is a disaster. I completely destroyed history.

Like Eric Stoltz.

Okay, why do you keep saying Eric Stoltz?

Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

What? 
Timetravel?

Are they talking about Back to the Future?

Come on. Who is this guy?

Okay, yeah, I know. I've seen all the movies

and Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly.

Really?

So explain Marty McThigh here .

I can't explain it to you, Gary.

That's not your thigh.

It's the wrong actor, and it's upside down.

Is it?

The point is that in Back to the Future,

Marty McFly...

is very famously played by Michael J. Fox.

The guy from Footloose?

No, that's Kevin Bacon.

Bacon.

Kevin Bacon is Maverick, with the volleyball,

and the gay guys of the planes. 
-Top Gun.

Big Balls of Fire. 
-Top Gun.

No no no. 
I...

I completely broke the Universe.

Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

Yes. 
Thank you.

I have created a world with no metahumans.

And now there is no one to defend us...

from Zod, Albert!

There is no Cyborg.

There is no Aquaman.

There is no Wonder Woman.

There is no Superman.

There is no Batman.

I'm Batman.

What did you just say?

I'm Batman...

Does Batman exist here? 
Of course.

Yeah, dude. Nobody knows who he really is

but he exists.

Right. Well we...

me and my cousin barry

We have to go to this cousin's dinner.

Now.

But it's been a pleasure to meet you all.

And Gary. 
Barry.

Barry. - Gary.

Barry!

Are you freaking kidding me with this place?

What is this? Hell?

It's open.

Look at all this cool shit.

Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

Hello?

Bruce?

Bruce, are you there?

Oh boy!

Hey, I didn't know you painted.

They are good.

Bruce Wayne?

Bruce?

Hey, check this out.

There are bells connected to every room in this house.

Hey, maybe we can find this Bruce guy...

If we ring all these bells, right?

Don't understand how service bells work?

That's what bells are for.

You ring them from all the other places.

What?

You don't have Downton Abbey in your Universe?

What is Downton Abbey?

The chain of family style restaurants?

It's like, a cheaper Banana Bees?

Do you know what I really go for right now?

Abbey's Sizzlin' Zucchini Pie.

OK.

Do it, old man!

I am helping you.

My God!

Who the hell are you?

I'm the guy who lives here.

We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

Are you hungry?

<i>ALIEN MESSAGE CAUSES MASS HYSTERIA</i>

So...

You are the same person as him,

but from an alternate time?

Yes

In which...

you and I are friends.

Yeah, you're probably my best friend.

Yeah.

Well, but you're a bit...

chronologically different. 
Older.

Well, and that's what I can't understand.

I traveled in time from here to here,

but somehow everything all changed...

back here.

Like when you were born, so...

Well, time is not linear.

Right?

Right.

At some point, you probably saw a movie...

what tells you...

that if you went back and changed the past...

You will create a kind of branched timeline.

Right.

How, look...

New present.

And new future.

Yes. 
Well, time doesn't work like that.

That's not how time works.

When you go back and change the past,

you create a foothold.

You put yourself in whole another strands...

of the spaghetti.

New future.

New past.

It is retrocausal.

It goes both ways.

Actually, it goes in many ways.

Maybe another time.

Agreed, but in an ontological paradox model,

there is no...

What you did was change the future

and you changed the past.

If a person is stupid enough...

to mess with time...

you eventually end up with this.

A Multiverse.

Some strands run almost parallel.

And there will be inevitable intersections.

And others that are simply...

wildly divergent.

But this is...

It's a hot mess.

The crapshoot.

It's all just a crapshoot.

And what does the Parmesan mean?

The metaphor is over. He's just a garnish.

Can I tell you something?

A person would have to be...

an idiot, to play craps...

with the space-time continuum.

Yes, an idiot.

Here.

Are you joking with the chewing noises, right now?

So...

you are the reason that...

this Zod character is...

about to destroy the Earth.

Maybe. 
And there's a guy called Superman...

who can stop Zod? 
Yeah, yeah.

And does flies?

Shoots lasers out of his eyes.

Yes, he flies, and he shoots lasers out of his eyes, yes.

No one said Superman.

I might be a little on the nose.

Do you call yourself Batman? 
Yes.

But I don't call myself Super-Batman.

Wait, he is Batman?

What do you think we are doing here?

This was the cousin's dinner.

He is... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

Not really. Not so much anymore.

You know,

They don't really need me.

Things have changed.

Gotham is now...

one of the safest cities in the world.

I need you. We need you.

In my timeline,

Batman is our strategist, our leader.

The world needs Superman.

And you are the best Detective in the world.

You're probably the only person who can help me find it.

So will you help us?

Pass.

Like, pass the salt?

Bruce?

He doesn't wanna help us?

We're gonna use his bat shit.

Bat shit?

Yeah, his bat stuff.

His bat things.

Stand on that thing.

OK.

Do you remember when you went through the ground?

Yeah.

I need you to do it again.

What is this place?

Dude.

This place is straight beeves.

Beeves?

Barry.

I almost died...

in an abyss

12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

Is this what I think it is?

Holy Shit.

I used to see this thing on the news, when I was a kid.

OK. Fine search. Date of birth.

He wasn't born, he arrived.

Barry, look.

I'm busy.

With what?

Looking for unidentified objects.

Entering Earth atmosphere...

anywhere near Kansas, in the last 50 years.

He has a backdoor into NASA.

Of course he has.

Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

His bag laughs.

<i>Joker's Laughing Bag (Jack Nicholson, Batman - 1989)</i>

Can't you take anything seriously?

Stop messing around.

Dude, come on.

Have you seen this place?

It's amazing.

Hello.

Had the gravity of this not sunk in for you.

Stop messing around, Barry.

I won't say it again.

Sorry mom.

Shut up.
Shut up.

You have no idea how lucky you are.

You have no idea. You take everything for granted.

You don't even appreciate.

You just walk around thinking you are so funny and so cool.

And it's embarrassing.

Because you are not any of those things.

Hey, screw you, man.

I've done nothing but everything you've asked.

You made me get struck by lightning.

I fell naked through the floor.

I terrified Mrs. Johanson.
Now probably gonna have to move.

And you don't even tell me why you're here.

Could you at least tell me why you are being so mean to me, for no reason?

You used monkey as a dart board.

Wait what?

Forget it.

The monkey?

So you are mad at me for playing with a toy?

It's not a toy.

Mom bought us this monkey.

Because she calls us monkey...

she gives us monkey stuff all the time.

Right.

Look.

I'm sorry.

I'm not really good with people.

Even myself.

Oh, come on...

you're not that bad.

Just be kind of a dick sometimes but....

let's face it i am pretty obnoxious.

I just get excited.

Come on.

This place is pretty cool, right?

Yeah.

Right, cool.

I let you work.

I know you're there.

You know what I'm stuck on.

That thing you said with the spaghetti.

You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

<i>TO BW FROM YOUR FRIEND ALFRED</i>
You had an Alfred.

My Bruce has an Alfred.

Different worlds. Different times.

Yet, there it is.

Certain people.

Certain events.

Certain strands of spaghetti.

Drawn to each other like, like magnets.

I've read all about temporal paradoxes and causal loops, but...

This is more than that.

Inevitable intersections or something none of
the theories could have anticipated, because...

well, how do you explain that, except for...

fate.

You are listening.

I'm sorry about your parents.

I was trying to save mine.

And there must be a way.

There is a way Barry. 
Keep trying, keep trying.

WAYNE COMPANIES

I found it.

Barry, wake up.

Clark is being held by a mercenary group...
<i>ASTEROID IMPACT... ALIEN LIFE ON BOARD...</i>

in a siberian black site.
<i>RECOVERED FOR INVESTIGATION... SIBERIA...</i>

Get up Barry.

My cat is on fire.

We're going to Russia.

Three

Coffee?

How will we get to Russia?

I'm going to help you find Superman.

And then...

you are on your own.

Yeah...

You're...

you are.

Yeah.

I'm Batman.

So what's the plan?

Let's go to what? Take out Superman and escape before it turns ugly?

I don't know.

You should ask him.

You ask him. 
You should ask him.

Yeah

I am not asking him.

Why not? I thought Batman
was supposed to be a friend.

Not this one. Not this Batman.

We're here.

<i>Activating hover mode.</i>

<i>Ejector seat, on.</i>

Ejector seat.

Ejector seat?

Okay, there are stages.

You are strapped to parachutes.

And where is yours?

This is so super.

All clear. Let's move

OK.

GOOD.

Everybody is fast now.

But why is it so cold?

It's the arctic, Barry.

Where did he go?

I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

Superman will be down there, for sure.

OK.

What did you do?

I had to move you. 
But I just did it a little.

This may hurt.

Just let it out.

Let's go.

That's where they keep Superman.

In a big scrotum.

<i>Access denied</i>

He's gonna hack the Soviet Security Cyber Scrotum, with a flip phone?

<i>Access granted</i>

I tried all the combinations.

Yes.

Damn.

Kal-El?

It's not him.

We gotta go.

Wait.

We can't just leave her here. 
Look at her.

I got this. 
You go.

I got you.

I'll handle this jimbrony.

But what...

Help.

they hurt me

Let's go from here.

This way.

Not there, not there.

Oh, no!

Change.

It's coming, it's coming.

Hurry, hurry.

I don't like the height.

Come.

Let's go.

You didn't tell me we could get shot.

Why would you assume we couldn't?

Oh great, to die under the feet of a Sputnik.

Oh man, I need this knee.

Stay calm, it will heal.

Come on.

<i>CHARGE LEVEL</i>

How much do you weight?

80 kilos each, plus her 200.

<i>LEVEL</i>

Hold on

Yes, they already got angry. 
Barry, shut up.

Yes, good.

What's the plan?

Batman, what do we do? What now?

Now... we try not to die.

Oh, you guys should have seen that in slo-mo.

Yeah, I just realized I didn't think it through very well.

There are good Kryptonians and there are very, very bad Kryptonians.

<i>ALIEN CRAFT SUSPENDED OVER US AIR FORCE</i>

I was sure we would find Superman.

And if we found Superman, all this would be super simple...

Who are you?

Holy funions.

Hi.

I'm Barry. 
We're Barry.

We were were trying to find Kal-El.

But, we found you instead.

What do you want with Kal-El?

We were trying to rescue him.

Why?

Because he is my friend.

Do you know him?

She looks angry. Get ready.

It could shoot laser beams at us or freeze us...

with your breath not start throwing us.

My name is Kara.

Daughter of Zor-El.

Kal-El was my cousin.

Yes, but who was Kal-El?

It's Superman.

No, you said it was Clark.

Who is Clark?

Clark is his human name.

Clark.

He was an infant when we left.

The last son of Krypton. I...

I was sent to protect him.

It looks like he never made it to Earth in this Universe.

Our pods, They must have separated.

Wait, so you thought a baby was
gonna protect us from this Zod guy?

General Zod is here?

He must have tracked my pod's signal.

I have to go.

No, don't wait.

You have to regain your strength.

Hey Barry,

take her to the roof...

and put her into the sun.

Yeah

Yeah, wherever you like it...

If you charge it with sunlight, I congratulate you because I have tried.

How about we take that with us?

Can I turn around now?

Are you dresssed in a red cape?

You're levitating?

Is there always so much noise?

Is there a lot of noise?

Are you okay?

Do you feel how...

strong or...

Yes. It seems that you are already strong.

You know, Grandpa Barry down there...

He says that if we don't stop Captain Zod, he will kill thousands of people.

Billions of people.

Billions?

All of your people.

Good people.

Good people?

We came to this planet
looking for a safe place to live.

And they put me in a cage.

Yes. A lot of humans are dicks.

But, there are also babies and...

balerinas and entertainemnt wrestlers.

Many are worth saving.

Maybe for you.

But I am not human.

I am Kryptonian.

She's gone.

I have to get my powers back.

If I can recreate the accident that gave me my powers...

I could reconnect with the speed force...

and maybe we'd stand a chance against Zod.

Or, kill yourself in the process.

Tell me something...

If you get your powers back...

you could go anywhere.

To another time line.

To another universe.

Why do you wanna stay and fight to save this one?

Because it is the Earth where my mom lives.

They...

I went back in time to save her.

I'm not going to lose her again.

The kid doesn't know, does he?

How do you tell someone something like that?

I lost my parents, but...

that pain...

made me who I am.

I'm not sure I know where I am without it,..

actually.

I spent a lifetime...

trying to right wrongs of the past.

Believing that wearing a cape and fighting crime...

would bring my parents back.

You actually did it.

So...

I guess the plan...

is douse yourself in industrial chemicals, while electrocuting yourself.

Yap

Want some help?

Oh yeah. That would be very useful.

In fact, he already borrowed his...

and I'm sitting in this chair.

I'm advancing.

Understood. 
Lima-Zebra, in sight.

This is the main group B601. - Primary team, confirm your ranks.

All emphasize.

You bring me nothing.

I gave you a warning.

Your failure to deliver the Kryptonian traitor,

is been taken as an act of war.

No.

We need air support.

OK.

When I flip the switch...

the current will travel through the cable and will attract lightning directly.

Here, put that on.

It's heat and impact resistant.

I'll protect you a bit.

Yes, but the point is for me not be protected.

OK.

You will have to move away. 
I will.

To electrocute us.

It's going to work, right?

Of course it will work.

Nothing we haven't done before.

Beside, this time we have Batman.

What could go wrong?

For the record, I think this is insane.

Get back

I'm fine, I'm fine.

We meet again, Mr. Lightning.

Do it!

Wait. What, no!

No. Stop, stop it. No.

Oh no. No.

Oh, no.

Barry, no.

Go again.

But...

please.

The circuit is fried.

I've got you.

Hey Barry.

You're fine like the last time, right?

Now you have to heal.

Look, look, look. It's working. It works, it works.

Hey, it's healing, it's healing.

What a relief that you are well.

I was scared to death.

Did you wake up?

How do you feel?

Slow.

Maybe this will help.

Yes. Hey, you look good.

Irresistible.

Man. Feels good to be back.

Yeah.

And what are we wearing tonight?

Do you like it?

I did it myself in that old batsuit.

But I did it with our colors and everything.

And look at this.

Less adjusted.

Flashy.

Hey, are you serious?

I really don't know what Flashy means.

Sounds like a positive thing.

What are you doing?

You came back.

I'm glad you're okay.

I have to ask you something.

When you found me in the hole they put me in...

and you saw that it wasn't Kal-El...

Why did you help me?

Because you needed help.

Do you know what this symbol stands for?

Supergirl?

It means hope, right?

Hope. Does it mean hope?

Krypton was a beautiful place.

We are a people of hope.

Not war.

General Zod...

<i>We broadcast live from Metropolis, where a few moments ago...</i>

Zod is maybe from Krypton,
<i>THE ALIEN SHIP HOVERS OVER METROPOLIS</i>

but he is not of my people.

So, you're saying...

Yes.

I will help you fight Zod.

Yes.

An interesting group.

What did you say our names were?

We're The Justice League.

No.

No?

Well, I mean.

We are going to lack an authentic Goddess and...

a friendly Terminator...

a super mermaid...

and it would be very nice to have a Batman.

You're in?

Do you want to get nuts?

Let's get nuts.

In my world, Superman appeared just as Zod called out to him.

So from now on we are in unknown territory.

What I do know is that Zod controls...

somehow, the world engine that...

is going to destroy much more than just Metropolis...

with every second that passes and let's not stop them.

Barry, what are you doing?

What?

Our kids will want to see this.

Your kids?

Well, the children of all the children of the whole world.

They will want to see this.

We're getting close.

I will stay in flight to shoot down your ships in the air.

And Barry, to clear this up...

It means that it will only be you and me against the entire Kryptonian army.

Chill.

Kara must be given time to defeat Zod.

Oh, and don't forget that your suit doesn't dissipate energy like mine...

so you must take breaks or you will accumulate too much charge.

Like what?

Hold on.

The humans we came to protect?

They don't know we're on their side.

Zod.

Kara Zor-El.

We've been waiting for you.

Hey, that space giant...

and Miss Murderer...

Are they also our responsibility?

Hey Hey hey. Don't think about them. Just calm down.

We'll start with those guys over there.

What if they're Kryptonians and we can't kill them.

But we can stop them, so she can take them down.

One at a time.

Okay, I disarm them and then you engage.

Punch them!

Come on, Barbie!

Let's go party?

OK.

Hey, calm down. you are fine Get up.

Wow, they are seriously fast.

Yes, but not as much as us.

The terraforming has begun.

This world must die, so that ours can revive.

We have to go. Let's go Danny. Run! Run!

Krypton is gone, Zod.

Your uncle Jor-El...

hid the key to Krypton's rebirth...

inside a Kryptonian child.

All the genetic material needed to start again.

Encoded inside the DNA...

and sent to Earth in an escape pod.

He's not here. You have failed.

We found him.

We intercepted his pod.

But your cousin was not the one we needed.

You are the one.

Kara Zor-El.

It is your blood, which we must harvest.

What did you do to Kal-El?

Your sacrifice, that will allow Krypton to live again.

What did you do to?!

The infant did not survive.

Look, new plan.

I'm going to create a cyclonic diversion...

and then you just come in hard...

feet first this time.

Yes!

Barry, did you see that?

Careful, you are accumulating a lot of charge.

Why don't I just singe it?

No no no no.

Barry, that was actually only half stupid.

But if you want to do that and not die...

You need to complete the circuit, by putting your hands together, like this.

oh shit

You're ready?

You go find her.

Bruce.

I'm going down.

But I'm not going alone.

No no no no.

Bruce.

Bruce, eject.

Bruce, you must eject.

No

Kara.

This shouldn't...

This was not supposed to happen.

Kara is dead.

And Batman.

It didn't have to be, right?

Because we can go back.

Like you did.

You're not that fast yet.

Are you sure?

Barry.

Barry, wait!

Is this back enough?

Yeah, I guess so.

Listen, Barry.

What?

It's ok, we can fix this.

Do you know what to change?

I know I will change.

I'm going after the big one.

Bruce aborts, the ship has a protection shield.

Roger that.

But he's not.

GOOD.

Yes, yes, please take him out.

Yes.

Here I am. Here I am.

No.

Hey...

You will be ok.

Not this time, kid.

Maybe some other time.

We can't bring you back, can we?

You already did.

You already did it...

Come on, Barry.

Gotta get up. Come on.

Barry.

Go again.

Let's go.

Barry, there is no point.

Barry.

Phase!

I have to get that out.

No no. I have to get that out. 
I'm fine.

This must have been before.

Again.

Barry.

OK. Can we please just take a minute?

Sorry.

Bro, of course.

That's the whole thing. 
We can take as much time as it takes.

No. that's not what I mean.

Hey hey.

OK. Ready?

Come on.

I need you in there.

Let's go. 
Barry, just listen to me.

Where were you?

Did you stay here the whole time?

Barry, this is an inevitable intersection.

You have to stop now. Barry!

At Barry, wait.

Barry, listen.

There's someting I should tell you.

I went back in time initially.

Because...

Yes, because mom died.

And how do you know?

It doesn't matter.

I have to undo what I did.

No, it's not a mistake.

We can save her.

And we can save them.

No, we can't.

This is what Bruce was talking about.

Barry, this is inevitable.

We can try a million times, 
and we are not able to fix this.

No matter what we do.

This world, dies, today.

Look around.

Look at the damage we're causing.

Now we have to stop, okay?

Look, I was just doing my laundry.

You were the one who came.

and told me I am a superhero.

And now you're saying what? 
You don't want me to be.

Well guess what...

I am...

The Flash.

And I can save everyone.

Nobody dies.

Barry...

Not every problem has a solution.

<i>Not every problem has a solution.</i>

Sometimes you just have to let go.

<i>Sometimes you just have to let go.</i>

Let go? From mom?

She will always be alive somewhere in time.

Always.

Not for us.

You are full of shit, dude.

I'm going back.

You'll going back to kill Mom.

No!

You stay!

You stay. Right here.

Just give me one more time.

Barry, wait!

I think we got off on the wrong foot.

Let's start again.

I am The Flash.

What's your name?

I've lived...

more than you can dream.

Not an answer.

Did you rehearse that?

Get outta here, Barry!

That scar.

Oh my god.

So, you are...

Yes, I am you.

We are so close.

I almost have it figured out.

How long have you been doing this?

Time is inconsequential.

Come on, Barry.

<i>In the sky! It's a bird!</i>

<i>It's a plane!</i>

<i>It's Superman!</i>

<i>The Adventures of Superman (George Reeves, 1951)</i>

<i>Jay Garrick / Black Flash (Teddy Sears, 2015)</i>

<i>Superman - The Movie (Christopher Reeve, 1978)</i>

<i>Supergirl (Helen Slater, 1984)</i>

<i>Completely foolproof!</i>

<i>Only the Joker would come up with that.</i>

<i>Superman Lives (Nicolas Cage, 1998)</i>

Please look at what's happening.

These worlds.

They are colliding and collapsing.

We did this.

We are destroying the fabric of everything.

You have to stop.

I'll stop when I fixed it.

It's not entirely your fault, Barry.

I pushed you out of chronospace that September 29th...

for you to put me on this path.

How do you like our endless paradox?

I made you create me.

And now you are the one...

in my way.

No matter how close I get to winning this fight.

You go back and let mom die.

You are the inevitable intersection.

I need you after let go.

What's he talking about?

You are my hero.

What did you do?

Hey, hey, don't worry.

It's gonna heal. 
It's gonna heal.

I just wanted, that...

Barry.

Tell mom that I love her.

Don't forget the tomato.

I loved that cereal, when I was a kid.

Yeah.

My son was mad for it.

They stopped making it.

I know that they were talking about discontinuing it.

Do I know you?

No, I'm not from around here.

I'm just visiting my mom.

Maybe I know her.

What's her name?

She's the best.

The kindest person in the world.

Are you okay?

Yeah, it's just...

I'm really gonna miss her.

I know I'm just a random lady in the store...

But do you want a hug?

Sure.

I'm sorry.

Oh, don't say that.

Your mom must be grateful that you came to visit her.

She is very lucky to have you.

I'm really lucky to have her.

Ah,  you have to tell her that.

Moms like to hear these kind of things.

Believe me.

<i>FROZEN FOOD</i>

I love you, mom.

I love you more.

I loved you first.

Bye. 
Bye.

I'm back.

I didn't know when you would return. See you in court. Iris.

Shit.

The court.

The evidence initially...

I'm so sorry.

<i>JUDGE</i>

As I was saying.

The same security camera footage, Exhibit F, in the original trial...

was initially considered useless.

But has now...

been enhanced...

using the latest tech...

of Wayne Enterprises.

It confirms, the alibi, Mr. Allen has argued, and his son...

Barry...

was corroborated, since day one.

Here.

Right here you can clearly see my client Mr. Allen.

reaching for a can of tomatoes...

from the top shelf.

Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, could you tell us a bit more about what happened, please?

Well the...

the tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to the top shelf...

and subsequently, uncooked the spaghetti.

Unquote.

I'm sorry that makes absolutely no sense.

What are you talking about Sir?

Thank you.

The allegations... 
Thank you so much.

See you later. Thank you.

Hey, was what I said right?

Yes. Spaghetti.

Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking...

You should ask me to dinner.

Dinner with me?

Yes. A date, Barry.

Iris West, do you want dinner date with me?

I'd love to. 
Thank you.

I'd love to also.

Call me.

â™ª La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida Â¡ay Dios! â™ª

<i>Bruce Wayne / Accept</i>

Bruce.

Congratulations.

You have no idea how big it is to hear your voice.

I have so much to tell you, the next time I see you.

Well, you were right.

Okay, and I didn't listen to you.

And things got very, very weird.

But I put everything back. I promise.

<i>I'm arriving.</i>

Oh great.

To the side, to the side. Everyone please back.

I want to ask...

Be careful, make way.

<i>Batman & Robin (George Clooney, 1997)</i>

Who the fuck is this?

He will not answer questions.

Hi Barry.

No. Where is...

Your...

No, it can not be.

You're not Batman?

What's wrong with you?

What?

The Flash (2023). Corrected and proofreading by tom1807

I tell you that because of my metabolism I can't get drunk.

And I don't get bitter either.

Listen, listen.

Because... No, no, no, no. I try to
explain to you as simple as I can.

I promise you.

All were Batman. Everyone was Bruce Wayne.

But each was a very different person.

So, in the other time... 
Negative.

I am the same.

Yes, in fact more or less. You're adorable,

furry, loyal, motivated by bacon.

OK. Hey...

Thank you for making it
simpler for me, Mr. Simple.

I do what I can.

Hey, but you're not understanding me.

In my timeline, when I...

Okay, up.

Get up.

Get up now.

What were you not going to sleep on the chair?

Arthur, I live here.

Barry.

I live here.

OK.

What, what?

More beer.

Go fast.

Let's see, here

Pay him with this..

Arthur, this is an Atlantean treasure.

Yes. Yes, tell them that.

Yeah.

Whatever you say.

He's fine.
