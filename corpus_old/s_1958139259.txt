<i>I know You shed tears.</i>

<i>I know You continue</i>
<i>to shed tears every day</i>

<i>because of man's ingratitude.</i>

<i>You choose souls,</i>

<i>and despite my unworthiness,</i>
<i>You've chosen me...</i>

<i>to help You.</i>

<i>And the more these souls suffer</i>

<i>without the slightest</i>
<i>consolation,</i>

<i>the more Your sufferings</i>
<i>are alleviated...</i>

<i>in this consists all of my joy.</i>

<i>I know You'll give me</i>
<i>what I need,</i>

<i>I know You will not refuse it.</i>

<i>I need courage.</i>

<i>I know You will provide.</i>

Padre!

I'm Pio.

Father.

Franco, Franco, my husband?

Giulio?

Salvato? Giulio?

I don't know.

Oreste!

I'm still a man.

I'm still a man.
I'm back.

<i>Viva l'Italia,</i>
<i>viva l'Italia.</i>

Vincenzo, put him
in a chair, help him.

I'm back. I'm back.
Uncle.

<i>Ciao,</i> Elvira.
Uncle.

Look at you! My baby!

Look at you,
your uncle is back.

Mom, mom. Mom.

San Giovanni Rotondo
welcomes home

his brave
and courageous soldiers.

<i>Viva l'Italia, viva l'Italia!</i>

My husband?

I don't know, sorry.

Anna. Anna.

Look at you.

Angelo, this is the list
of the dead.

Saponaro Nunzio?

I cannot read.

"I regret to inform you
that your son, Saponaro Nunzio,

died from wounds
sustained on 26th October
while fighting on the Carso."

We have already lost
one son on the Carso.

Your excellency, my husband?

What is your husband's name?

Giulio. Giulio Leogrande.

Hopefully, he will be back
with the next group. Who knows?

Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

Cheers, yeah, cheers.

Look, instead of my eye.

We won!

Wine, man, wine.
<i>Viva l'Italia!</i>

<i>Viva l'Italia!</i>
Yeah!

Yeah!

<i>Un brindisi.</i>

<i>- SÃ¬!</i>
<i>- SÃ¬!</i>

Yeah!

The sorrows
for Italy and for the world

is not finished.

Every people
is still suffering of that

and every families
are in grief or big sorrow.

It's terrible.

The king...

Uh...

Some intellectuals,
some interested in the...

in the armies, militaries...

Uh...

Have convinced other people
to make war or compel them

And the majority of Italians...

do not want war.

Christ...

offered Himself,

with His body,

with His flesh to the Father,

in similar way
we offer of our self,

our bodies,

our flesh

to God

in, uh, union with Christ.

Sometimes this is suffering,
sometimes not,

but the suffering
in union with Christ

is a door to the Heaven.

This em-- suffering lived alone

is a door to Hell.

So...

you managed to avoid
going to war.

You tried so hard

and you finally succeeded.

I'm ill.

If I wasn't, I'd be there.

You are no more than
a whimsical child
crying for his mother.

My mother is the Madonna.

Liar.

The letters you wrote
to your devoted followers,

that's what get you out
of your military service.

No.

Is that your little Madonna?

Tell me, where you weeping
when you wrote this?

Was your hand quivering?

"I also must ask you a favor.

I would very much like for you
to write to Donna Giovina Cevera

in order for her
to put in a good word

with these butcher superiors."

"Butchers"?

Those officers were doing
their duty. No more, no less.

And to you they are butchers?

I'm not scared of you.

I'm protected
by the blood of Christ.

You're a coward.
No.

You're a little boy.
No.

No courage.

You ask others to have courage.

A coward.

A piss-drenched coward.
No.

Let's talk about
a real coward.

Let's talk about the trust,
the few that loved you,

and the trust
you fucking abused,

the fucking countless women
you fucking had,

your narcissistic...
No... No.

...way with--
No.

But here's where
it gets better.
Shh!

You stop now, you stop now.

In a few months--
You say "Christ is Lord."

You say "Christ is Lord."

In a few--
You say "Christ is Lord!"

Christ is Lord!
You say "Christ is Lord!"

You say "Christ is Lord!"

You say it! Say it!

Say "Christ is Lord!"

Christ is Lord!
You say "Christ is Lord!"

The primary source
of all human oppression
and exploitation

is individual property.

Oppression,
you know what it is?

Oppression means cruel
and unjust treatment.

It's what happened to you.

You work hard
every day, right?

You work all day or not?

Do you ever stop?

This is not right,
this is not fair.

Exploitation means
that you're not the one

who takes the benefit
from your work.

"In nature, everything
is transformed.

Nothing is created
and nothing is destroyed.

Following this natural law

that wants transformation

is the struggle for existence
and the revolution."

Nature is a cycle
of constant change.

The way Spring arrives
after Winter,

or the way...

the calf grows
into the milk-giving cow.

You know that, right?

That's what I'm saying.

We need change.

Change is a natural law.

The land and everything
it gives us

belongs to everybody.

Yes.
And one family can't control

San Giovanni Rotondo.
Yeah, that's true.

Yeah, that's true.

What is he talking about?

He's talking about
how we can get control
of our lives.

I'm talking about freedom.

To have freedom, we must stop
the exploitation by the masters.

Exploitation?

You spent your life in school.

What are you saying?

You are an Alberizzi,

you're part
of a landowner family.

Calm.
That's true.

How was life in Bologna
while we fought to protect you?

Is this not a contradiction?

You want to talk
about contradictions?

You won right?

But what did you win?

This war led to nothing.
Our sacrifices led to nothing.

Where's your husband?

She doesn't know.

Bring me a candle.

If a candle gives you light,

do not curse the candle.

Welcome, comrade.
Welcome back.

How's everyone?

Please.

Please, have a seat.

Have a seat.

I introduce you to Luigi.

He's our young,
radical comrade.

Pleasure.

My pleasure.

Now, in San Giovanni,

they say that
I'm a revolutionary,

a fire starter, it's true.

But it's consciences
I want to set fire to.

Yes, but let's focus
on winning the elections now.

We need to speak
of winning votes.

Do you think Lenin and Trotsky
cared about elections?

Socialism is a process.

So, comrades...

You must be careful
how you interpret

the great Russian revolution.

The world is not transformed

by following the plans
that a prophet writes on paper

or preaches to the masses.

Their socialism is not ours.

Social revolution...

is not the creation

of one man's will.

Lenin is neither a leader
nor a prophet.

He's a politician.

So... comrades,

we will not take power
with violence,

but with the consent
of the masses.

We put our flag in good hands

and we win.

Raised high...

...for-- for all to see.

Yeah.

What's going on?

Look at me.

We're not interested
in people like you in my town.

Do you understand me?

Now leave
and don't come back.

Get him in the car.

Let's go
to the car, come on.

Get out of here, asshole.

Get out of here, asshole.

Go.

Don't come back.

<i>My dearest</i>
<i>Father Benedetto...</i>

<i>If I could fly,</i>

<i>I'd like to shout.</i>

<i>I'd like to cry out to everyone</i>
<i>at the top of my voice.</i>

<i>Love Jesus.</i>

<i>Love him who's</i>
<i>so deserving of love.</i>

<i>But alas, my dear Father,</i>

<i>my soul is still strongly</i>
<i>bound to the body</i>

<i>and many are the sins which</i>
<i>impede the flight of my soul.</i>

<i>If you could pray that</i>
<i>the Lord might be pleased</i>

<i>to shorten my exile,</i>

<i>and explain to me the origin</i>
<i>of this blind desire I have</i>

<i>to depart from this life,</i>

<i>I'd appreciate it.</i>

<i>My sins are many</i>
<i>and they ought to check</i>
<i>my blind passion.</i>

<i>I ponder over them, yet,</i>

<i>I feel more and more attracted</i>

<i>by the desire to take flight</i>
<i>from this world.</i>

<i>Do you recognize this?</i>

<i>Is this the work of the ogre?</i>

<i>Please keep me</i>
<i>continually warned.</i>

These used to belong
to that poor little girl.

Her mother asked me
to repair them.

She won't be
needing them anymore.

And what was her fault?
To be born poor?

In the gospel it is written

that it will be very difficult
for a rich man

to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,

while Marx said so too,
in his own way.

You're talking about
the Kingdom of Heaven,

but here we live in hell.

I walk alone among them,

in front of their ailments,

their cries, their problems,

most unsolvable.

Here we need water,
we need a hospital.

The little kid died because
I could not get the medicine

I needed to save her.

We need to change things.

But we, the socialists,
are divided.

We are against each other.

Luigi wants to talk about
the brotherhood of the workers,

but here we only have
the unemployed.

And most of them
can neither read or write.

I know it is hard.

We are divided,

but you do not despair,

because whoever
is not with you

is not necessarily
against you.

Call them friends,

if not brothers.

And remember the words
of the poor carpenter

when he said, "There is
no greater love than this,

to give one's life
for one's friends."

Friends, huh...

Even shoes are divided
according to their social class.

<i>I feel that sometimes</i>

<i>when I'm in the midst of prayer</i>

<i>that I'm just...</i>

<i>that I feel alone like I'm...</i>

<i>I feel not alone like lonely,</i>

<i>but alone like the Lord</i>
<i>has abandoned me,</i>

<i>and I'm essentially</i>
<i>talking to myself.</i>

Do you feel in darkness?

Yes, tremendous.

Do you feel abandoned?

Yes.

And scared and baffled
and confused and...

and like I'm sinning
but I don't--

I don't know
if I'm sinning or not,

because it feels like a sin
to the question these things,

it feels like a sin
to be angry with the Lord.

And I'm angry a lot.

I feel angry a lot.

You know?
I can tell you,

the Lord hasn't
abandoned you.

He's with you even
in the midst of darkness.

You have to keep
your purer life,

and receiving
the sacraments.

It's the way,
it's the only way

to be able to stay
in the right road.

Without the Lord,
you can't do anything.

I know.

The war...

took our two sons
away from us.

They were both young.

We cannot find a reason
to live anymore.

But if God wanted this,

even Him,

why does He want
to keep us alive?

To torment us?
No, no.

War is a terrible thing,
Francesco.

And your pain is real, yes.

Do not let Satan take
advantage of your suffering.

Do you understand?

Blessed is the man who
endures the trial, Francesco.

When I was young,

my mother would do
embroidery at home,

yes, sitting in a chair.

And, uh, I, sitting in a stool,
looked up at the work...

but I would only see it
from upside down.

I'd see the knots
and the confused threads,

and I'd say to my mother,
"What are you doing?

What is this?

Why is it so ugly?"

And my mother,
she would lower the frame,

and she would show me
the good side of the work,

and I would see
all of the colors

were in the right place

and the pattern
was beautiful,

precise.

I, like you now,
can only see

the work from upside down
'cause I was sitting
in a short stool, Francesco.

If you lift your spirit
up in prayer,

the Lord will show you
the design He has for you.

Calm.

Stay calm.

What are you guys doing?

We are we working the land
that you keep abandoned.

They need it to eat.

So if you're not using it,
we have the right to.

Socialism alone
will be enough

to create the most
perfect balance

between men, order,
and peace,

because human beings,
in their free development,

will understand that no man
can be truly free and happy

if not in the respect
of all humanity.
What are you guys looking at?

Huh? Leave my land now!

Get out of here!

Leave now!

I'm gonna kill you all!

Do you hear me? All!

Get out of here!

Luigi, run!

Run! Run!
Go!

Okay? All of you, guys,
this is my land!

Hey, Luigi, if you ever
come back here, I shoot you!

Listen.

Have the courage
to do what you hear.

Come on, come on.

Work, work.

How about your man?

Any news from him?

Go and talk
with some other woman,

I have a husband.

I go! I go!

I go!

I go! I go!

Salvatore! Salvatore!

Salvatore!
Salvatore!

Salvatore!

Fast, fast!

What happened? Salvatore!

Salvato!

A doctor!

What are you doing?
Go back to work, come on.

Vincenzo, don't let anyone in.

Doctor's coming, get out.

Out!

Poor man, he made it
through the war.

Tell them he's still alive.

What?

You go out, you tell them
he's still alive,

or else things
are gonna get ugly here.

I'll have no part in this.
This man is dead!

I don't care, you tell them
he's still alive,

that we need to take him
to the hospital, okay?

I will not.

No?
No.

So if anybody gets hurt
it's on you, okay?

Everything is going
to be alright, okay?

Now go back to work.

I'm not going anywhere.

I will wait here.

What are you saying?
Go to work or you go back home.

Come on, go to work.

Look how good you are
serving your boss.

It's the slave labor
that made him sick.

Go.

It's the slave labor
that made him sick.

What are you doing?

Go back to work
or I'll send you off,

and I'm not paying you.

Go back to work. Go!

Come on!

I'm going home. Fuck your pay.
Yeah, go home.

...the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women

and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God,

pray for us sinners,

now and at the hour
of our death.

Amen.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women

and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God...

...pray for us sinners,

now and at the hour
of our death.

...full of grace,

the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women

and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God,

pray for us sinners,

now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

That's the effect
of the poison gas from the war.

He never should
have been working.

What was he going
to do? Starve?

So let's not let him
die in vain. Hm?

Hi, Francesco.

Hi.
How are you?

Mm.
You gotta be strong, eh?

Thank you.
You have to be strong.

Listen. Have you registered?

N-no, not yet.

You need to vote, brother.
You need to vote.

It's our opportunity here.
We have to stick together.

Hm?
I will.

You already registered right?

Yeah, we already done, brother.

That's not the point.

You still talking
about elections?

Yeah. What do you think?
It is important.

It's our opportunity
to act together.

It's time we start doing to them
what they have been doing to us.

The two of you
can't come in here.

Who says so?

We do.
The socialists.

We're all from the same village.

Tell your friend
to be ashamed.

Tell him he's so friendly
with his masters

that now he has become
their lap dog.

That's enough now! Hey!

Pay some respect
for the dead!

They have no respect
for the living.

And you have no respect
for those who fought
for their country.

You mean for your masters,
right?

Some raw deal you got.

You're gonna pay for that.

I'll be waiting for you.

Don Anselmo,
I wanna show you a thing.

You know, this is custom-made
by my family.

My grandfather gave it to me,
I'm gonna give it to my son.

It's a family tradition,
you know?

Hold it, it's a beautiful gun,
beautiful.

I know
you like hunting.

Why don't you come hunt
with us one day?

Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

For you, Father.
Here.

Thank you.
Give it to me.

Elvira.
Yeah?

Give him the money.
Oh, okay.

Father,

we want to give you a little
something for the parish.

Next to my heart.

Bruno.
Gerardo.

Let's go upstairs.

He's a friend of mine,
Bruno Bevere.

My mom, my aunt.

Elvira is, uh...
Hi.

She's Renato's wife.

Uh...
Good.

A friend is here.

Good evening, Renato.
Bruno.

Father.

Join us, take a seat, Bruno.

Thank you.
Yeah.

May I offer you
something to drink?

Mm-hmm.

So, I was talking
with Don Anselmo.

We were making final plans
about the election.

I'm sure I will win. I mean,
I have no doubt about it.

But you know,
if the other side just...

If they create a riot,
or if they--

if they, like, manipulate
the actual voting,

that--that could be
a problem.

That's why I am here.

I've been away
at the front for so long.

You know,
I fought for two years

and then I come back here,
you know,

and I have to worry
about all this.

The election.

I mean, this is insane.

These people,
they've been working for us

forever, you know,

and now you're
expecting them to vote.

I just-- you know,
I don't get it.

They have no rights.

I mean, these people
are, you know,

nothing.
It's the first free election

we have in our country.

Hmm.
You fought for it.

Appreciate it.

Hey.
Who's there?

What's happening?

Come in here, come.

Michele,
I want to kill him!

What's happening?

I should have killed them all.

Luigi Fiore said
he will kill all of us.

Our cousin, Luigi.

We send this little punk
to university

and he comes back
with those ideas, huh?

Didn't they teach him
this is Italy, not Russia?

Luigi Fiore and who else?

Who else?

And, uh...

Michele Russo.

Angelo Rinaldi, the doctor,

he cannot control them,
he's too weak.

Two decorated for valor,
you and you.

One wounded in war.

And now you,

the respectable people
of this village

must be subjected to this.

These socialists need a lesson

about life and death,

but they don't believe, so...

they won't need a priest.

Otherwise,

they will end up preventing you
from baptizing your children,

abusing your women.

They will kill the priests,

and use churches for barns.

There's someone out there!

Get down,
get down. Move, move!

Diana.

Get down, get down.

Stay back, stay back.

The weapons.

Bless me father
for I've sinned.

My last confession
was 160 days ago.

Since then...

I've been feeling
a lot of anger,

especially toward my son.

I shout at him.

He doesn't listen to me.

He reminds me

of my mother

who died a year ago.

I still hold a lot
of resentment against her.

Lately...

I've been observing my...

my daughter...

as she washes herself.

Her body's changing.

Her nipples are changing
their color.

I look at her body,

I feel aroused.

No.
I can't help it.

I, uh, I don't know how to--
No.

You have a darkness
in your heart.

It manifests itself as evil.

Evil you perpetuate
on your family with

no apologies, no...

There's no contrition
in anything you have to say,

you relish in it.

It's unacceptable.

I would assign as penance
for your mother and your son

that you fast on bread and water
for the next week.

You say three Hail Mary's
and three Our Father's

everyday for the next month.

As for your daughter,
there is no penance
that's adequate.

Be grateful I'm not God.

I'm just a friar who prays.

It's beyond me.

This is beyond me.

I would bar you from communion
until the last rites,

save for Christ's compassion.

Go to God.

Don't come to me, go to God.

God cannot help me.

God can help you.

God is capable of pulling
the highest good
out of the worst tragedy.

God can help you.

Go to God.

I think God doesn't exist.

Why?

If you continue behaving
the way you're behaving,

you're going to hell,
you understand that?

You understand that?

I don't know if there's hell.

You don't know if there's hell?

No.
You will when you get there.

Get up and get out. Get up.

Get out.

I have a question for you.
Shh! Shut the fuck up!

Say "Christ is Lord."

Say "Christ is Lord."

Say it, you say
"Christ is Lord!"

Get out! Get out!

Please, God,

please bring our Papa home

to be healthy, safe, and alive.

Where are we going?

We're going to the elections.

What means elections?

That's a good question.

Elections are a game,
a game we need to win, Diana.

You see?
A game?

We're gonna vote over there.

I'll see you later.
Alright.

Okay.

Thank you.

Put the cross
by the hammer and sickle.

Yeah, it is easy.
Put the cross...

You gotta put the cross
by the hammer and sickle.

By the hammer and sickle.

I've split them apart

and I'm keeping them for myself.

There's your glory for you.

Stay in your place.

Do not compete with me

for things you cannot make
a claim to.

The last five years of misery

will be nothing
to what is to come.

A hundred million dead,
that sounds right, yes?

Amen.

The election was a fraud,
we won the votes.

We were robbed!

Fuck all those guys!

My brother is the mayor.

We were robbed.

That red flag will never be
raised next to the tricolor.

You got it? Come on.

Vincenzo, you know
what you're going to do?

You tell them anyone
who supported the other side,

they no longer have a job.

Okay? I don't wanna
see them ever again.

Giuseppe.

Help me!

Help me!

Help me!

Help! Help me!

Help me! Help me! Help me!

Help me!

Help me!

You are a socialist now?

What are you doing here?

To tell you're fired.
They don't want you anymore.

And how I'm gonna feed
my children?

Let the socialist feed them.

Fine.

Fine?

My husband is gonna come back.

He will take care of us.

Your husband is dead.

He's not coming back.

How you know?

I saw him.

I've loved you my whole life.

<i>I was born four times.</i>

<i>The first,</i>

<i>from my mother.</i>

<i>The second,</i>
<i>when I received baptism.</i>

<i>The third,</i>
<i>when I entered this order.</i>

<i>And the fourth,</i>

<i>when the Lord came to visit me.</i>

<i>And since that visitation,</i>
<i>Father...</i>

<i>this desire</i>

<i>has been growing</i>
<i>continually in my heart.</i>

<i>It is now what I would call</i>
<i>a strong passion.</i>

<i>I have in fact</i>

<i>made this offering</i>
<i>to the Lord many times...</i>

<i>by seeking Him to pour out</i>
<i>upon me all the punishments</i>

<i>for all the sinners</i>
<i>and all the souls</i>
<i>in a state of purgation.</i>

<i>Even increasing them</i>

<i>upon me a hundred-fold,</i>

<i>so long as He quickly</i>
<i>admits to Paradise,</i>

<i>all the sinners and all</i>
<i>the souls in purgatory.</i>

<i>But I should now,</i>

<i>formally,</i>

<i>might to make this offering</i>

<i>to the Lord</i>
<i>in obedience to You.</i>

<i>This is my purpose.</i>

<i>And more than that</i>
<i>it seems to me</i>

<i>that Jesus really wants this.</i>

<i>I'm sure You have no difficulty</i>
<i>in granting me this permission.</i>

<i>Please bless me, Father,</i>
<i>and pray for me also.</i>

<i>Your friend, your brother,</i>

<i>Pio.</i>

We won! We won!
We won! We won!

Today is our day!
Today is our day!

Today is our day!
Today is our day!

Today is our day!
Today is our day!

Today is our day!
Today is our day!

Today is our day!
Today is our day!

For reason
of public safety,

you must postpone
this ceremony.

What?
It's a prefect's order.

You're not the mayor, Angelo.

The vote wasn't valid. I won.

Get out of here!
Go back home.

What did he say?

They want to postpone
the ceremony.

But it is our right, we won.

Who ordered them to do so?

It's an order
from the prefect.

I won't tell you again,
just go home.

You go home, Gerardo, we stay.
 It's our building now.

I'm gonna get the flag
and stick it into your ass,
you hear me?

Out!
Fuck you, Gerardo!

You go! You go!
Fuck you! We won!
It's our right. Right?

Fix the bayonets.

We won! We won!

Back off!

We won! It's our right!

Okay, guys, okay,
it's better to go home.

It's too dangerous, okay?
We return another time, okay?

Prepare to fire!

Let's move, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

No, no.
Come on.

What-- No! No!
We return another time, guys.

We return another time, guys.
We return another time.

No, we won't go.
We're not going.

Leave! Get the fuck off!
We won't go!

Leave!
You fucking bitch!

You don't talk to me like that!

We won!

Open the door! Open!

Get out! Get out!

Get out!
Fire!

Fire!

Fire!

Fire!
