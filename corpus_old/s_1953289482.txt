It's 7:15, you guys.

You're gonna be late.
I know.

God, that guy's such an ass.
Stacey.

What? He almost just ran me over.
You shouldn't be getting out that side.

Go out that side.
Hey, honey, did you get the list?

I've already done it.
Great.

Of course.
Really?

Girls.
I hear it all day.

"Your sister was a great student.
Emma loved this book."

Stace, enough.

I have a showing at 5.
I'll be home around 6.

Dinner requests?
Anything's good. Bye, Mom.

Bye, sweetie. I love you.

She's the perfect girl
and I'm the bad sister.

No, you're not.
Have a great day, honey.

Breathe, Em. They're probably
gonna talk about stuff we know.

I'm only going
to get out of first period.

We can be a little late.
Not really.

Oh, my dog, you're going to explode
if you stay this tight.

Speaking of tight...

Hey, Emma.

"Hey, Emma"?
He fricking knows your name.

I guess.
Stephen Sullivan knows your name.

Can we go to class now, please?
Will you sleep with him? For me.

All right, listen up, everybody.

The bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp tomorrow...

so be on time. Otherwise...

Sony, prom queen.

Hey, find a seat. Let's go.
What?

I expect it from Mr. McMullen,
but I'd hope better from you, Emma.

Sony, Mr. Christiansen.
All right.

So tomorrow the bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp, all right?

Be on time or the bus
will be leaving without you.

How'd Lonely Boy get on this trip?
Daddy probably bought his way on.

What?
You know I can hear you, right?

For the first five days...

...we'll be helping to renovate a school
with Project Humanity.

The last three days,
we'll be exploring the island...

...and going on cultural excursions,
and it should be a lot of fun.

So headline:
Stephen knows Emma's name.

Say what?
I'll trade you for your burger.

You can have it.
You sure?

Yeah, I just wanted the fries.
Okay, so Emma and Stephen?

I kind of like that.
Yeah.

We have one week on the island
to work our magic...

...and get Emma here
laid by the quarterback.

Do I have a say in this?
No, not at all.

We're there to be helping people.
I'm trying to "help" you.

We have jobs to do.
I have looked at the itinerary.

You made the itinerary.

The school has every day
and night planned.

So? We'll change the plans.
That's life, right?

Oh, and BT-dubs, I just found out...

...carnival in Trinidad
is when we're there.

Oh, my God.
I totally have to get a new bathing suit.

Really?
What?

Emma's scoping Lonely Boy.
Oh, he was in my middle school.

He used to be really nice.
Yeah, used to be.

I heard he got kicked out
of the last school he was in.

I think he's kind of cute...

...in a Rebel Without a Cause,
Holden Caulfield kind of way.

Let me make it simple.

Girls like our Em don't hook up
with freaks like what's-his-face.

Especially when she's got
the quarterback on the hook.

You can hand me that.

Busted!
Loser.

Follow me to the principal's office.
Well, then lead the way.

Way to go, pal.
Well done.

Looks like someone's
not going on the trip.

<i>Well, folks,
it looks like we're in for another...</i>

Wow, how long you planning
on staying?

You can never be too prepared, Phil.

Thank you guys so much
for letting me go.

So I had to take a second mortgage out
and Mom has to sell an extra mansion.

Don't tell her that.

I love our kids so much.

If this is for an eight-day trip, what's
it gonna be like to send her to college?

I know.

I'm thinking we have to move
to Princeton with you.

I support that idea. Yep.
Right?

Wouldn't you love that?

What are you talking about,
you don't wanna go?

Know what strings I had to pull
to get you on this trip?

For who, Dad, me or you?

I don't even wanna go
on this stupid trip.

I'm gonna be forced to hang
with people I never talk to anyway.

It's an opportunity, son.

It's a chance to do something
for someone other than yourself.

Can we go? We're gonna be late.

I'd be stuck here, and you'd have
to look at my face all week.

Let's go, gang. All aboard!

Be careful.
Emma, Lizzie.

Be safe.
Say bye.

Love you.
Let's get a move. Come on.

Dean, be safe.

Will do, Father.

How you doing, Emma?
Crazy early, right?

That was two sentences.
He's upping his game.

You are so getting laid.

Okay, everybody, listen up.
Project starts tomorrow.

We have a few hours today
to get settled in and hang by the pool.

Then we're all gonna go
have dinner.

What'd I tell you, Em?
Screw your schedule.

This is gonna be the best ever.

No locals. Damn. Oh, well.
Who's the lucky boy?

Don't worry, Em.
I'm not gonna steal your quarterback.

All right, ladies. Let's do this.

One, two...

Yeah, ladies.

Don't splash me.

Gotcha.
No!

All right, man, good job.
Spread it out now.

Hey, hey, hey. Be careful up there.
Whatever you say, boss.

He's gonna get freaking killed
and ruin it for all of us.

You should get some lotion
on your shoulders. You're gonna burn.

Day two
and first contact has been made?

Yes, please.

This is gonna be easier
than I thought.

Looks like Mama's
getting some vac-action.

Game on, dudes.

Skyping.
With the 'rentals.

Okay, get off now.
Seriously, it's urgent.

<i>Honey, are you all right?</i>

Yeah. Sony, Ms. Collier
is calling lights out.

<i>All right, go ahead.
We love you. Have fun.</i>

<i>- Get a good night's sleep, babe.
Love you. Bye.</i>

<i>- B ye, honey.
Good night.</i>

I'm downstairs buying toothpaste...

...because I ran out.
Can you believe they charge--?

Losing.
Okay.

Headline: Carnival party tonight
on some local dude's boat. I know.

And Stephen invited us,
and he singled you out, young Emma.

They're leaving right now,
but the boat leaves in a half-hour.

I don't know.
Shut it.

We are going. You are going...

...even if I have to tie you up
and drag you to the boat.

Seriously, we'll be done
by midnight.

Two o'clock, the latest.
Okay.

Yeah!

Carnival!



Thank you.

Want a taxi?

Go.

Carnival, bitches!

Hurry, we're gonna miss it.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Don't leave.
Run for it.

This is so fun.

Hey, ladies, what's up?
Oh, no, that's okay.

Okay, let's get a cocktail
and find your man.

Not my man and not drinking.

Em, you've gotta loosen up.
You know, switch it around.

Get out of your element just a little.
I like my element.

I'm gonna go find Helen.

Is that your new boyfriend?

What's it to you?

<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

Prepare to be boarded.

Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

Move to the front of the boat.

Move to the bow of the boat.

Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

Emma!
Help!

This is the Trinidad Police.

What the hell are you doing?
I fell.

Where's Emma?
I thought she was with you.

Climb up.

You all right?
Just great.

What are you doing?

I'm in enough trouble.
I can't get busted.

You crazy? We'll dodge the cops?

We'll be fine. We'll go to the hotel
when things cool down.

On this?
I wanna get back on the boat.

They're getting too far away.
We'll hang back and follow them.

We'll be fine.
Hurry.

We won't be able to see the boat.

How we gonna get out of here?
I'm working on it.

Do you even know which way to go?
Be quiet. Let me think.

Damn it, no motor.
No motor? What now, genius?

I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?

We're stuck out here.
This isn't some stupid little thing--

Hold on.

Please put your suitcases by the door
to be loaded into the awaiting cabs.

I'd like to thank those of you...

...who brought this unique opportunity
to an abrupt end.

Welcome, gentlemen.
Glad you could make it.

Too bad you're on your way home.

Ms. Collier, Emma's not here.
What?

She never came home last night.

I didn't tell anyone because I thought
she was with someone, but--

Okay, well,
how do you know that she's not?

You know her. She wouldn't just bail
She has a schedule to keep.

I tried her cell. She's not answering.

All right, well,
where did you see her last?

On the boat.



How far do you think we've drifted?
I don't know. Keep an eye out.

Can't be that far.
We've been out here for hours.

Was this pan of your brilliant plan?

I can't believe my phone got soaked.
Yeah, I can't believe that either.

Try your phone again.

I told you,
I'm not getting reception out here.

You want some more water?
Thanks.

I can't believe you brought water
to a party.

I didn't wanna get dehydrated.
That gives you a hangover.

Really? I thought it was the tequila.

I still can't believe there's no motor.
That's the point of the dinghy, right?

For emergencies.
Why else have the damn dinghy?

What? How is that funny?
-"Dinghy's" funny.

It's a funny word, "dinghy."

We're floating in the Caribbean.

You know that, right?
Yeah.

I also know freaking out isn't gonna
make us any less screwed, so...

So, what do we do?

For now, we float, I guess.

Want some gum?

Why, is my breath bad?

Probably.

Elizabeth Kover.
Here.

Samuel Leif er.

Here.
Dean McMullen.

Dean? Dean McMullen?
Anyone seen Dean?

You should try that.
No, thanks.

You want me to get your back?

What's with all the Ziplocs?
What?

You carry all your crap in baggies?

It keeps things from getting messy.

How's that working out for you?
Well, at least my phone is dry.

We should've followed the police boat
back to shore.

What, with a single paddle? Sure.
I'm just saying.

First of all, I figured we'd be able
to row back in later.

Second, lest we forget, prom queen,
you decided to take a dip...

-...in stormy waters.
I fell off the boat.

And my name is Emma.

Okay, Emma.

Oh, my God.
What?

Island, there.
Where?

Right there. Okay.
Oh, that's way too far.

We should sit here
until someone picks us up.

Are you kidding?

Fine, I'll paddle.
Okay, okay.

I'll paddle. Jeez.

She never made it back to the hotel?

No. I thought maybe she was--
Was she drinking?

What's that have to do with anything?
Was she with Dean?

What? No.
But he was on the boat?

Yeah, but she didn't meet anyone.
And she wasn't hooking up with Dean.

Ms. Collier, tell them--
Can anything be done to find them?

More than likely, they'll find you.

This type of thing isn't uncommon.
It's the youthful spirit of adventure.

No, this is my best friend
we're talking about. I know her.

She has no youthful spirit
of adventure.

Dean!

You okay?

Yeah.

You?

Yeah. Think so.

No coverage.
We'll have to find a phone.

Great.

Well, wait up.

Come on.

Really? Who's that for?

I don't know. Shoot the bad guys?

No, you finish it.
I could use a coffee.

Like a mocha ice blended
with an extra shot.

Oh, man. How good would that be?

What was that?
I hate bugs.

Well, you've come
to the right place, then.

Let's just find a hotel.

We finish working
on the school today.

I'll bet everyone's probably
all worried about us.

You, maybe. I can promise you
nobody's worried about me.

Yeah, this is Jack.

I'm sorry, what?

Excuse me. Mrs. Robinson?
Barbara.

Jack McMullen. I'm Dean's father.
Nice to meet you.

What were they doing on the boat,
and who was watching them?

Now, Mrs. Rob--
Don't condescend to me.

Don't you dare condescend to me.
I trusted you with our daughter.

They can't find her.

It's okay, we'll find her.
When is the next flight?

There's a redeye tonight
that makes connections in Trinidad.

There's not an earlier flight?
That's the earliest.

I can help you with arrangements--

You've done enough.
Thank you. Let's go.

My feet are killing me.
I fricking hate hiking.

You wanna wear my Chucks?
It's okay.

Thanks, though.

Hey, look.

Stop.
What? They're berries.

White and yellow, kill a fellow.
Purple and blue, good for you.

You're a little bit weird.
You know that, right?

Been called worse.

Oh, my...

It's beautiful.

Come on. We gotta keep going.

Let's just find a hotel.
What?

We may never get back here again.

Come on. Take a picture.
We're already in enough trouble.

You know they grade this trip.
I cannot mess with my GPA.

Hello? Do you know
how unique this is?

Okay.
What's your number-one school?

Princeton. Why?

You know how many people
applying to Princeton have a 4.0?

A lot.

You know how many people
have been swimming in this?

Think of the essay you could write.

Come on.

We gotta find a hotel.

So lame. Fine.

See, this is why I don't hang out
with people.

I can't wait
until we get to a real bathroom.

I can't wait for a coffee.

Where are we?

We've been walking for hours.

And we haven't seen
a single road, person.

We better get back to the boat.

Come on, it's gonna be along walk.

What if we have to spend the night
on this island?

I don't think we're gonna find
a five-star hotel around here.

Do you know how to make a fire?
I do.

Perfect.
What?

A cave?

I am not sleeping in a cave.

It's the safest place to be.
Dry if it rains, only one way in.

Protection from the elements.

Hey, can I use your phone?

Sure. There's no signal.

I'm not a cave person.
None of us are cave persons.

We haven't been cave people
for a long...

<i>Go, 90, go.-</i>

So that's a no on the cave.

Where's the boat?

I'm really tired.

Can we take a break soon?

Sure.
Thanks.

You see something?

No.

Use the flare gun.
You need at least two flares.

I saw it in a book.

I think it was the one with the girl who
sails around the world with her cat.

You fire two flares,
one to get their attention...

...and the other
so they can locate you.

Who's "they"?

The people that are gonna
come get us, I guess.

Our families and the police
or whoever.

Dean, what are you doing?

What was that about?

Hey, can I borrow
some of that bug stuff?

Sure.
Thanks.

You want a pillow?
Thanks.

Wait a sec.
What?

Damn, you should be
on that Price Is Right show.

I knew it was in here.

I put it in there in case I got hungry
when we were building yesterday.

Thanks.

And I think you meant
Let's Make a Deal.

Right.

That show.

Here's some more.
Thanks.

<i>Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami
scheduled to depart at 11 p. m...</i>

<i>...is now expected to depart
at 12:10 a.m. from Gate 211.</i>

We're gonna get there.

Why do you call me "prom queen"?

Aren't you?
No.

You seem like you should be.
Perfect girl, perfect world.

I can't tell if you're being
mean or nice.

What do you think's out there?
In the woods.

We're gonna be fine.
I know.

Still can't get a signal.
Here.

What are you doing?
You're gonna waste the battery.

Just playing some music.

Here.

Take my shin.
Thank you.

Sure.

Night.
Night.

They'll come for us. I know it.

What was that?

<i>Hey.-</i>

You're a morning person, huh?

What are you doing?

I'm trying to save us.
What are you doing?

I don't know. Might go for a swim.

Hey, where's your phone?
Battery's dead.

We need some more water.

The police have a boat searching
the area where they picked up the kids.

As soon as they come back--
When will they be back?

I'm not sure.

They said they'd let us know when--
Any word?

I was just telling Barbara the police
have a boat searching the Caribbean.

They did say
that a dinghy was missing.

How long they been looking?
What about a helicopter?

As soon as the winds die down,
they're gonna send someone up.

Have they been searching land?
Have you contacted the embassy?

Is there a private team we can hire?

The police are doing everything
that they can...

...with the limited resources
that they have.

There is no private rescue team.

But they did say
they were very confident...

...they're going to find
Dean and Emma.

The first 48 hours
is the most important.

But the chief said that kids do this
If I hear one more time...

Are you kidding me?

It's been two days.
What are these people doing?

Except offering anecdotal crap
about other teenagers.

All right, look, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

Help us find our children.

The hut's gonna be something
in case it rains.

Rain?

You never know.

You okay? Come here.

This may sting a little.
Does that hurt?

Here, keep the pressure on it.

So why Princeton?

Why do you wanna go to Princeton?
I don't know.

It's Ivy League.
Yeah.

It's just where we talked
about me going.

It's kind of weird, right?

It's always been
where I wanted to go.

Where I was supposed to go.

I don't think
I ever even questioned it.

Yeah.

They're not gonna give up.

No, they'll come. For you.

Thanks, guys.

Prepare to board in five minutes.

I'm sorry.

<i>Did you find her?</i>

Not yet, but we will.

Yeah, we're gonna
go back out tomorrow.

Sweetie, your mom and I are gonna
need to stay a few more days.

Is that okay?

<i>Sure. Stay however long you need.</i>

There we go.
That should hold for a bit.

Seriously?

Okay, now it's good.

Celebration swim?

Come on.

Come on, it's like a million degrees.
We earned it.

I cannot eat any more fruit!

Hey, prom queen!
Don't look.

I was just gonna ask
if you had any more sunscreen left.

I don't have any more anything left.
Look yourself.

The bottles are in the baggies
in the hut.

I looked for them, didn't see any.
They're there, but they're empty.

I'm sure there's aloe somewhere.
Now turn around and stop looking.

You know that every time you say that,
it reminds me I should be looking?

I'm serious.

You're the one
who asked me to stand guard.

There's something out there.
I can hear it at night.

<i>This afternoon,
according to officials...</i>

<i>the investigation
has been downgraded...</i>

<i>...from a search-and-rescue
to a search-and-recovery effort...</i>

<i>...as hope of finding the pair alive
has faded.</i>

I want you to call me every day.

Sometimes twice a day if you can.
I will, I promise.

I just hate the idea
of leaving you alone down here.

I'll be fine. You've gotta go back.

Stacey needs one of us there,
especially now.

No, I know. You're right.

Well, it's official.
They called off the rescue search.

See what this is?
They don't have the resources.

That's what it is.

<i>--For the families
and the students back home...</i>

<i>...who have kept constant...</i>

I'm not gonna stop, Phil.

I promise, I'll bring her back home.

I know you will.

I know you will.

Jack, thank you for hiring this.

We'll keep covering these waters.

We still have two hours
of flying time.

I miss my mom and dad.

I even miss my little sister.

And my fish.

The smell of my sheets
when they first get out of the dryer.

I'll bet they're still looking for us.

They'd have to be, right?

You think they quit?
Would you?

I mean, you keep looking
for something, at some point...

...you figure it's gone, right?

Why do you do this?
Watch the sunset every day?

Looking for something.
What?

Nothing. It's stupid.

Zippo's dead.

What is it?

Oh, my God.

How long do you think
he was there?

How long do you think he pretended
that he was gonna make it home?

This guy is not us, Em.

He could've been
some local fisherman...

...or drug smuggler or anyone.

You've got people out there
who love you.

People looking for you.

And you know what else?
We got each other.

And that's something right there,
prom queen.

We're gonna be okay. You hear me?

Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

Why are you crying?

That was...

That felt so good.

You make that sound
like a bad thing.

It's just...

...for a while, I forgot where we were.

I pictured us home...

worrying about what everybody
was gonna say.

I felt so normal.

Hey, where's my latte?

I'm going to the lagoon.

Dean, did you take
the big water bottle?

Dean?

Dean?

Dean?

Dean?

Why would you do that?
Do what?

Leave me there without saying
where you were going--

You were sleeping.
And I woke up and you were nowhere.

What are you doing?
He deserves to be buried.

Okay? At least have a funeral.

Dean, I don't understand. What--?

Talk to me. I'm here and--
You're here and what?

We had sex once.
We're stuck on an island.

We're not soul mates.

That's mean.

Yeah, I'm not a nice guy, Emma.
And now you know.

I don't believe that.

Whatever it is, I'll listen.
Please, just give me--

Emma!

I'm so sorry, Em. I didn't mean to...

It was an accident. I fell.

I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to you.

What are we doing?

We're not some happy couple
on an island vacation.

How are we gonna make it
day after day, just the two of us?

What if something goes wrong?
I mean, what if I broke my leg...

...or one of us gets sick
or something like that?

Nobody knows what's out there, Em.

There's stuff that
we don't know how to deal with...

...and we just gotta figure it out.

I didn't go to my mom's funeral.

That's why I wanted to bury that guy.
Just flesh.

Ashes to ashes.

I thought maybe seeing him
dead in the ground and all that...

...would make things make sense.

Did it?

Not really.

I guess that's the point.

It doesn't always makes sense.

We need hydrotherapy.

And you kind of stink, so...

Step into my office and tell me
about your problems, Mr. McMullen.

I couldn't handle seeing...

Seeing all of it.

You know, the casket
and all the people pitying me.

Blaming me or--

Why would they blame you?

Because I killed her.

She was driving me home
from soccer practice.

We were driving down this side road,
and it was dark.

We used to play this game
when it was snowing...

...where she'd flick on the high beams,
on and off.

It'd look like we were going
into hyperspace...

...from a Star Wars movie
or something like that.

I reached over, trying to be funny,
trying to be like her.

Lost control of the car.

We were laughing,
and the next thing...

I was in the hospital for three days.

When I got out, she was gone.

You didn't kill her.

No.

We should maybe think
about moving here.

Nice neighborhood, and I hear
the public schools are great.

A month after two students went
missing off the coast of Trinidad...

...the search for Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

...has been called off.

It's believed that the students
have been lost at sea.

I can't believe
they're gonna stop looking for her.

Even if it's just for her body
or something.

Wow, Helen, that's kind of morbid.

Well, her mom's still there.
Maybe she'll find her.

I know we've been over this...

...but if you'd look
at the new information...

...regarding weather patterns, you'd see
we've been looking in the wrong place.

Mrs. Robinson,
I've seen this information.

Perhaps your embassy can--
I've been to the embassy twice.

Excuse me,
have you seen these two?

Sony, folks,
no planes taking off today.

They say the storm
could last for days.

Yep.

When my wife died...

...l tried so hard to keep her here,
you know...

...keep her alive.

I almost lost everything I had.

Dean and I barely spoke.

I almost lost my partnership
at the firm.

I was so focused on what I'd lost,
I forgot what I had.

Maybe it's time to go home, Barbara.

It's not like we haven't tried.

It's a tough call.

Whenever we were at the beach...

...my mom used to talk
about the green flash.

My dad and I would watch
and watch.

I've never seen it.

It's supposed to be
right on the horizon line...

...just as the sun comes down.

I'm thinking maybe it's just a thing...

...people believe in to make them feel
like there's something out there...

...you know? Beauty or whatever.

How long do you really think
we can survive here?

We're gonna be fine, okay?

Should we feel guilty?

For what?

Not being sad all the time.

They probably think we're dead.

But we're not dead.

So we gotta live a little, right?

I just feel like
we should be doing something...

...like trying to find a way off or...

We tried.

We'll keep trying.

Have you been shaving?

What?

You have, like, almost no beard.

Okay, first of all, bite me.

And second of all, it'll get heavier...

...l hope.

Was that okay?

I mean...

...was I okay?

Emma, you are so much better
than okay.

Okay?

If okay is around here somewhere,
you are way over the damn palm trees.

If okay is like a little tiny grain of sand,
you're the whole beach.

If okay is like a little drop of water...

...you're like
the whole freaking Caribbean.

Need me to go on?

Okay.

You were never like this at school.

Like what?

I don't know, fun.

You're different too.
No, I'm not.

Yeah, you kind of are.

How so?

No posse, no books.

I used to watch you sometimes.

That's not creepy.

You always seemed like
you had a plan.

Like you had something to do
or somewhere to go.

I guess now
you got nowhere to go, huh?

I can't believe I'm saying this...

...but I kind of like where I am.

And for the record,
I watched you sometimes too.

Who was your first time?

Oh, we're playing that game?
Yeah, we are. Who?

I was a sophomore
and she was a junior.

Do I know her?
No, she was in college.

I don't know.

I thought she could teach me
some stuff.

Was it fun?

All five minutes were a blast.

Okay, who was your first?

No, no, no.

I told you mine,
now you have to tell me yours.

Football player? Band geek?

Teacher?
You.

What?

You.
Me?

I was your...?

Is that a bad "wow"?
No.

Just a "WOW H

Was it okay?

I got sand in some weird places.

I'm glad it was me.

Me too.

So since this is all pretty new
to me...

...maybe we should practice more.

Yeah.

Emma, did you hear that?

Plane! Get the flare gun.
I'll catch up with you.

No, no, no.

Hey! Hey! Hey!

They were too high.

Did you fire both flares? I didn't see.
No, I couldn't find the gun.

What do you mean?
It's in the same place it's always been.

This is our chance, Dean.

I don't understand.
Where could it be?

Did you move it?
No.

You're the only one
who's picked it up.

So you're saying I lost it?

I'm not saying anybody lost it,
I'm just saying it's not there.

Someone's been taking our stuff.

The baggies and my lotions
and my sunscreen and toothpaste.

That stuff ran out a long time ago.
Yeah, but I kept the bottles.

I use them for aloe
and for water and...

Where's the water bottle?
It's probably there somewhere.

I bet you were organizing things--
Oh, really, organizing?

That's what happened,
I organized too much.

Hang on.

Emma. Emma.
Get off me.

What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

I can't. I can't do this.
I cannot stay on this island any more.

What are you gonna do, swim back?

Emma.

Hello!

There's no one out there, is there?

Hello!

We've seen one plane
since we've been here.

I'm never gonna see
my family again.

We'll be better off in there,
long-term.

What's long-term, Dean?

Look, Em, at some point,
we're gonna have to say this is it.

This is our life, you know?
It's you and me.

You hear that?

It's nothing. It's just the wind.

I'm gonna find whatever it is
and make it stop.

Dean, no.

Dean?

Dean!

Dean!

Dean!

You see that? You saw it. You saw it.
I saw it. I saw it.

You saw it. We saw it.
Oh, my God, we saw it.

Think it was the fish?
It smelled a little weird.

You think maybe you're pregnant?

No, I'm not.

It's not that I don't want kids,
it's just...

You know.
I know.

Yeah.

You want kids?

Someday.

Me too.

I'd give anything
for some toothpaste right now.

And some chicken soup
and a sad movie.

Come here, lie down.
I'll make you feel better.

Do you ever think about
what everybody else is doing?

Who's everybody else?

Friends, family...

...people out in the world.

We're everybody else now,
prom queen.

What was that?
What the--?

Okay there, buddy. Stop, stop.
Okay, put it down.

Put the gun down
and step away from the vehicle.

Come on, monkey, drop the gun.

No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Put it down!

Come on, little guy.
I'll trade you, banana for the gun.

He didn't even take his banana.

You know what?

What the hell?
What'd you do that for?

I don't wanna hope any more.
You're acting crazy. Why did--?

I'm crazy? No, see,
crazy is thinking that we can survive...

...for more than a year on this island.

That's crazy.

We're gonna make a life here, Em.
It's gonna be better, I promise.

No noise. I mean,
what's so good out there anyway?

Life, Dean.
Life is what's so good out there.

Our families, our-- Everything.

You're crazy if you think...

...that I would actually choose
to live like this.

This is not living, this is surviving.

Any luck?

No.

I never said thank you.

For what?
For saving me.

For being there. Here.

Emma...

Hey!
Hey!

Hey!
Where is it?

Here, hold this.

Load and shoot, Em.

Pull the trigger, prom queen.

Over here!
Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! We're here!

Family and friends
eagerly await the appearance...

...of two students lost at sea
for more than three months.

Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

...were rescued
by a helicopter pilot...

...on a sightseeing tour
just off the coast of Venezuela.

Hey, get down.
I don't think so.

There's Emma.
Emma!

Hey, Emma!

Over here!
Emma!

Hey, Emma!

Emma!

I never thought I'd see you again.

<i>- Hey.-
Hey.-</i>

What are you doing here?

I wanted to check on you,
first night back and all.

I was just looking at Facebook
and stuff.

Weird being back, huh?
Yeah.

They said we don't have to
go back to school right away.

Yeah, I know.

Of course you are.
What does that mean?

Nothing, just...

I guess summer's over, huh?

You're talking in code.

My dad told me about your party.

Mom's throwing it,
a homecoming thing.

Are you gonna come?
Lots of kids from school will be there.

It'll be fun.
Yeah, fun.

You should probably go.

My mom and dad have been checking
on me like every 10 minutes.

Sure.

Come to the party, okay?

First of all,
thank you so much for coming.

It's a special day for us.

I can't imagine the courage it took
to survive those days.

I really can't.
But I'm so grateful that you did.

To my girl and to Dean.

Where is Dean?
Behind you.

I cannot thank you enough.

You kids really are
an inspiration to us all.

I mean that. To Emma and to Dean.

To Emma and to Dean.
Hear, hear.

Yeah.

Thank you for coming.
Thanks so much for having us.

How come you're not over there
with everybody else?

I'm not really an everybody-else
kind of guy.

Emma is. Always has been.

She's really good at that.
People really like her.

Yeah, I can see that.

Did you see any sharks?

It took her like two seconds
to become even more popular...

-...than before you guys went away.
Yeah, I can see that too.

Come <i>on.</i>
Like the memoirs. You know what?

<i>I can't come. Sorry.</i>

<i>They're calling it
"the miracle at sea. "</i>

After more than 100 days
on a desert island...

...two high school juniors,
Emmaline Robinson...

...and Dean McMullen,
have safely returned to their school...

...to their family, to their friends,
to their lives...

...that they thought
they might never see again.

Welcome back.

Excuse us.

I told him I'd think about it.

Oh, my God, Em, you're my hero.
You told Stephen...?

You are so the bomb.

Anyway, so I'm gonna wear...

Hey, McMullen.

Come on.

Mom wanted me to tell you
it was dinnertime.

Okay.
And I was gonna feed the fish.

Yeah, go ahead. You can feed them.
Okay.

What's with the dresses?

I don't know.

It's all feeling like...

It's all feeling like someone else.

You know, when you were gone,
Mom knew I was there for once.

I didn't have to yell
or get in trouble or anything.

At school,
all the teachers were nice to me.

Even if it was just for pity,
I didn't care.

And now you're the girl
who survived on the island...

...going to prom with
the F'ing quarterback, for crap's sake.

And I'm back to just being me.

Stacey, you're amazing...

...and cool and funny...

...and all of these things
that I can never be.

And just so you know,
I'm not going to prom with Stephen.

Really?
Well, who are you gonna go with?

Nobody.

You wanna be my date?

I missed you, Emma.
I missed you too.

I missed you so much.

I saw it, Mom.

I saw the green flash.

It was beautiful.

And...

And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for not being there at your funeral.

And thanks for watching over us.

What do you think?
It's amazing.

There's a cute hipster boy
looking right at you, sis.

He's looking at you, Em.
Don't think so.

Go.

<i>In front.</i>

<i>Three down. Oh, what a save.</i>

<i>Cleared but not out.</i>

<i>Another shot blocked.</i>

You staying in tonight?
Yeah.

<i>--The goalie and clears the center
down the ice.</i>

<i>We're just hanging on now, with...</i>

You wanna borrow my tux?

Emma, you look amazing.

Stephen's gotta be going crazy.

He's kind of gross anyway...

...in a smoking-hot kind of way.

Come on, walk with me.

You know,
I knew this was always in you.

It just took being stuck in the middle
of the ocean to find it, but...

Let's get you a broody boy.

Oh, my dog

Damn, he looks good.

Go. Be romantic.

I've been trying to come up
with the perfect thing to say.

I mean, I...
I didn't even know if I could get in.

Plans are overrated.

I got you something.

Thank you.
Wanna dance, prom queen?

I'm not the prom queen. I never was.

Never wanted to be. I...

I'm just a girl.

Wanna dance, girl?

It's kind of pouring.

We've been through worse.
Yeah.
