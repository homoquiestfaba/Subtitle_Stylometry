Once Upon a Time,
a classic fairy tale...

You found me.

...was turned upside down.

This is my happy ending.

I had never seen anything
like it on television.

It always leaves you wanting
to know more.

People see themselves in the show.

Tonight we celebrate...

Snow!
Charming.

...a story of love...

I think true love is massive, you know,

and that's a big part of it.

...and hope...
It is never too late.

No!

...of heroes...
Aah!

I think there's something
that everyone responds to.

...and villains...
It's very rare

that you get the opportunity

to try and put a spin
on such classic characters.

I wouldn't count it.

...of courage...

It's not our fight. It's mine.

There's a lot of lessons
to learn from our show.

...and honor...

Everything that you want
from a fairy tale.

Villains don't get happy endings.

...of fate...

You will always find me,
and I will always find you.

...and family.

You're here.
Yes. We're coming to get you.

The cast of "Once Upon a Time"

joins creators Edward Kitsis
and Adam Horowitz...

We're just trying
to tell a new story

based on all these things that we love.

...for an enchanting journey
through the realms...

It's about hope,
and it's always been about hope.

It's back.

I was blown away
by the scale of it.

It was really special.

Aah! Neal!

...where magic...

Look who you're really dealing with.

...Is everywhere...
No!

This show is so much fun.

...and happy endings...

I'm excited to find out
what's gonna happen.

...can sometimes...
Aah!

Let's go!

...turn wicked.
I didn't see that coming.

Ooh!

Who are we dealing with?

Wicked always wins.

"Once Upon a Time" has taken us
from Storybrooke, Maine,

to the Enchanted Forest,

and all the realms in between.

Most recently, our heroes
journeyed to Neverland

to save young Henry
from the clutches of Peter Pan.

They were successful,

but Pan found his way to Storybrooke

and cast the queen's curse.

We have no choice. You have to go.

All the fairy-tale characters

were sent back to the Enchanted Forest,

leaving Henry and Emma
to begin a new life

with no memory
of their time in Storybrooke.

But if there has been one
constant along this journey...

...it's that anything is possible

if you hold on to hope.

Swan.

Who are you?

An old friend.

So let us go back in time

when a young boy set everything
in motion.

Are you Emma Swan?

Yeah. Who are you?

My name's Henry. I'm your son.

When I first got the pilot
script for "Once Upon a Time,"

I was absolutely blown away.

Every page was so outrageously creative

and different
than anything I'd ever read.

They're not fairy tales.

Every story in this book
actually happened.

Of course it did.

It was just so innovative,

and the writing is so incredible.

I couldn't believe
that they were able to find

a way to make these characters
accessible

to every member of a family.

The Evil Queen did it with her curse.

An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy-tale characters here?

Yeah. And now they're trapped.

I never read a script like this before.

There was so much humanity,

and that really resonated with me.

Where have you been?!

I found my real mom!

I just remember I was amazed

and make this all
sort of a cohesive thing.

It was definitely
something I wanted to be part of

after reading it

because I just wanted to know more

about all of these characters.

Well, wherever you're going, be careful.

I... if you need anything...

You'll find me.

Always.

I love the idea,
and I love the notion,

the premise, the fact
that you had Storybrooke...

Hi. My name's Mr. Gold.

...And fairytale land.

Rumplestiltskin.

And these two characters
kind of run in hand in hand.

It's not very often you get
offered two characters in one.

Now we're talking.

There's so much going on at
any given moment on this show.

And there's a lot of room
for interpretation.

Even though there was

a very high-concept way
of presenting that,

the underlying meaning

was so significant and so universal

that I felt like it had a real chance

of being something
that people related to.

You're too late.

When we watched the
finished product of the pilot,

it kind of just went beyond
all expectation.

And it just had all of that magic in it.

Open it.

That moment where Prince Charming

finds her in a casket in the forest

surrounded by the dwarfs

and gives her true love's kiss
and wakes her up,

I mean, it felt really special.

It felt magical.

It started to snow for real.

You.

You could feel that we were filming

this iconic image from fairy tales.

You found me.

It's phenomenal.

I'll never cease to be amazed

at the scale of it, the size of it.

Do you, Snow White,

promise to take this man
to be your husband?

I do.

Fairy tales, you know,
were really the first stories

you hear as a child,
and they stay with you forever.

I have a lot of fun
with the fairytale land stuff...

very interesting, twisted plots.

Everybody's sort of grown up
with fairy tales.

My mom took me to see "Snow White",

and I saw the Evil Queen on screen

and got scared to death.

I shall destroy your happiness

if it is the last thing I do.

Hey!

"Snow White" was the first film
I remember seeing, you know?

And that was the biggest effect
on me, I suppose, as a child.

The witch particularly
just really freaked me out.

I like to be spooked,

so Hansel and Gretel
was one of my favorites,

Little Red Riding Hood

because I like things
that are really scary.

It's just fun.

It's fun to get...
you know, to be scared.

I'm something of a disneyphile,
I call it.

And "Snow White"
was my first princess love.

Snow? What are you doing?

I really did love Hook as a kid.

What's the name of the place
we're headed, captain?

Neverland!

The possibility of being able
to live forever is fantastic.

Cinderella was very relatable to me

because I was kind of
a misunderstood kid,

and I think that feeling outcast

was something that
I subconsciously related to.

Did you get everything you desired?

Most of these
fairy tales and the characters

thematically all have a good
message in there somewhere.

Like, you look
at "Beauty and the Beast."

Did you do all this for me?

It's what's on the inside that counts.

You're not who I thought you were.

And I'm glad.

It's something we love to
explore on the show, which is,

what is a happy ending,
and is there such a thing?

I love you, Henry.

And that, I think, is a question

that all of our characters deal with.

I love you, too.

You saved me.

That's what we loved about fairy tales.

It's why people buy lottery tickets

in the hope that overnight
your life will change.

You found us.

Everyone!

Fairy tales come in all sizes.

Grab an ax. It will give you
your dwarf name.

I've always called our show

sort of the ultimate fan fiction.

The material is so ripe for invention.

The ax never lies, Dreamy.

I always remember
Eddie saying... Grumpy.

He said, "why is he Grumpy?"

Then you've got more than one episode

to explain why he is Grumpy.

Bossy, had me another ax.

We thought
that it would be so much fun

to put our own twists
on these fairy tales...

It's "Grumpy" now.

...and playing the "what if" game.

You know, what if
Snow White's best friend

was Little Red Riding Hood?

Everyone calls me Red.

What if Pinocchio met the daughter

of Snow White and Prince Charming?

There were just so many
different permutations

that really excited us.

What's that?

That is your happy ending.

What if the Evil Queen
had her happy ending?

What if the Evil Queen
got what she wanted?

Here's an opportunity
to take these characters

and go deeper with them.

Help!
Shh. Someone's here.

Somebody help me!

I love that episode.

I love that we got to see
the Evil Queen in love.

She's doe-eyed and excited about life.

Help! Give me your hand!

When she saves Snow White,

she has a genuine smile on her face

and she's really happy
to meet this little girl.

It's okay, dear. You're safe.

You saved my life.

Regina.
I'm Snow White.

Oh, my gosh.

Lana Parrilla and I watched
that episode together.

We both started crying.

What are you doing with him?

Snow, I can explain.

To find out
that that was at the heart

of our relationship...

You can never tell my mother.

...changed how we portrayed
our characters

for the rest of the series thus far.

I should have let her die on that horse.

Because we all do truly love
all of these characters,

I think it's just so satisfying

once you start playing
that "what if" game.

And the next step for us

was this notion of mashing them up.

Geppetto, can you build such a thing?

Me and my boy, we can do it.

We are going to take Snow White

and we're gonna take Captain Hook

and we're gonna take Peter Pan
and the Wicked Witch,

and we're gonna throw them all together
in our backyard and play with them.

You know, I could have just
poof-ed us up here in an instant.

Belle hanging out
with Grumpy in the dwarf tavern.

Thank you.

You know, so, you're sort of like,

"oh, well, that never happened."

Ursula?

I loved Ursula.

Hello.

I felt so honored to play her.

You're... real.

The way they've twisted them around

and the way the relationships
have developed

through the different characters
is really cool.

You sent me a message...

"help! Help! Can you save us?"

The answer is...

Yes.

These two characters coming together,

it's the beast,
but it's Rumplestiltskin.

Belle, you can't go with this... beast.

I think it's a fantastic dynamic.

It's such a fun relationship to play.

You will dust my collection
and launder my clothing.

Yes.

You will fetch me fresh straw

when I'm spinning at the wheel.
Got it.

And you will skin the children
I hunt for their pelts.

That one was a quip.

The cup is so iconic.

I'm so sorry, but, uh, it's chipped.

Oh, it's just a cup.

"It's just a cup."

She's like, "okay."

Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

I was wrong.

Not a rat at all. More like a crocodile.

I did like the story line
with him being the crocodile.

I thought it was a good twist
on the story, you know?

You.

Rumplestiltskin.

What Robert does with Rumple
is fantastic

because he's not based on
anybody whereas, like, Hook...

we've all seen different incarnations.

So, are you done trying to kill me?

I believe so.

We started off
under the premise

that there was Mr. Gold
and there was Rumplestiltskin.

But as the seasons have progressed,

it's really about five or six
characters now.

It's gonna be hard to kiss her

when you don't know where she is.

Yeah!

So I need to be careful with the voice,

with the mannerisms, with the movements.

What will make you happy?

All of these things
that make up the character,

I'll have to kind of
keep close track of.

What are you doing?

Opening these. It's almost spring.

We should let some light in.

I love the curtains,

'cause that's really the first moment

that they have a physical
and emotional connection.

Thank you.

I really enjoyed performing it
and working with Emilie.

But what no one could plan for
was the reaction that that had.

People are saying this episode

gives them hope that everyone
has got a chance...

What's happening?

...to find love.

Kiss me again. I... it's working.

I think that happy endings are earned.

I don't think they're
necessarily just given to you

or just lying around.
Here.

Why, thank you.

"Once Upon a Time" is mashing up

all these fairy tales together.

But the reality is,
Eddie and Adam have written

a new fairy tale
which is about Emma and Henry.

I'm sorry I lied to you about your dad.

I promise I will never lie to you again.

When you come together to tell a story

that has that at the root of it,

I think a lot of that overflows

into the lives that are
bringing it to life every week.

Just don't push me away.

I won't.

It definitely ends up
touching us, as well.

So Rumplestiltskin is Henry's grandfather?

Apparently.

This extended family has many ties.

So his step-grandmother
is Regina, the Evil Queen.

Actually, his step-great-grandmother.

Good thing we don't have
Thanksgiving in our land

'cause that dinner would suck.

Oh, my gosh. We're one
ginormous family on this show.

Well, the family tree begins

with Snow White

and the Evil Queen,
who is her stepmother.

You are most certainly
the fairest of them all.

Regina is the daughter
of Cora,

who was the student of Rumplestiltskin.

Let's begin.

Snow White then met a shepherd...

...who became Prince Charming.

Will you marry me?

We have Snow White and
Prince Charming's daughter...

...Who they lost to a curse.

And that daughter became Emma Swan.

So it's true.

Snow White and Prince Charming
are my parents.

Emma met Neal, also known as Baelfire.

Neal?
Emma.

I am the son
of Rumplestiltskin and Milah.

What's his name?
Baelfire.

Rumplestiltskin was married to Milah,

who left him for Captain Hook.

Who's this?

Oh, that's no one. It's just my husband.

Rumplestiltskin's son ends up

with Snow White
and Prince Charming's daughter.

Is this my son?

Emma and I had a son, Henry.

Yes.
...Who Emma gave up

because she didn't feel like
she could be a mother,

who ended up being adopted
by Regina, the Evil Queen.

So that makes Regina

Henry's stepgrandmother and mother.

I'm your mother.

No, you're not.

Regina is the adopted mother of Henry.

I am the birth mother of Henry.

Grandpa?

Yeah, kid. I suppose so.

And then we have Peter Pan,
who's Rumple's father.

Hello, laddy.

Peter Pan.

Peter Pan was Rumple's father

who used magic to reverse his aging.

Where's Henry?

Oh, you mean my great-grandson.

So Peter Pan is Henry's
great-grandfather?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Family show.

But every happy family...

Now, my boy, for your present.

...has a few dark secrets.

Why would you do that?!

The seer said the boy
would be my undoing,

so I have no choice.

I must be his.

The darker-element fairy tales
were fascinating to me.

They were scary yet sort of comforting.

You.

I do love it when we go dark.

I prefer playing...
we call her Snow Gray.

Kill me.
What?

It's a chance for me to explore

something incredibly new and scary.

Aah!

I love that scene on so many levels.

It was beautifully written,

and Ginny and I had a really
good time working on that scene.

Do you see that?

What did you do to it?

Oh, I didn't do that.

Being able to play that out was fun.

You did it.

And once you blacken your heart,
it only grows darker.

I like the dark side of the show, too.

Aah!

I'm very lucky with Hook.

I get to play both sides of the coin.

You know, he's good sometimes.
Then he's really bad.

Eee.

Killing me's gonna take
a lot more than that, deary.

That Rumplestiltskin, I think,
is the interesting one

because that's the one who's not
quite complete, you know?

He's nasty.

He can kill things at the drop of a hat.

And he's a dangerous character
at that point.

When you see him with the seer,
the hands...

You will find him.

How?

He hasn't really been the Dark
One for so long at that point,

and he's kind of... he's very mean.

The boy will be your undoing.

Then I'll just have to kill him.

I've always been attracted

to the dark side of these fairy tales.

I like exploring that world.

In true "Once Upon a Time" style,

these characters just keep getting

deeper and deeper and more complex.

I want you all to know what I feel,

and that is regret that I was
not able to cause more pain.

I love that episode,
and I love that switch,

and she has that kind of smile
at the end

where, you know, I think
she also likes to put on a show.

And above all else,
with every ounce of my being,

I regret that I was not able to kill...

Snow White!

There have been so many times

when they could have killed each other,

and they never actually do it.

Do it! Crush it! Get it over with.

And put you out of your misery?

Now get off my porch.

Ripping hearts out is fun to do.

It's odd and weird,

and the heart is so strange-looking.

You know, it's like this
rubbery, plastic, weird thing,

and you're pulling it
out from someone's armpit.

This...

...is how it's done.

It's just odd.

I wanted a heart,
and a heart I shall have.

I think she enjoys doing it.

Again, it shows her power,
and that was very seductive.

We know that if your heart
is taken from you,

you can be controlled...

Bring the boy to me.

...or you can be killed.

We know that if your shadow
has been taken from you...

It can pretty much result
in instant death.

He rips your shadow
right from your body.

R-r-r-r-ip.

I gather it hurts.

And we met the
original shadow of Neverland

who sounded a lot like Marilyn Manson.

You have to believe.

I'll take the heart rip.

You know, because with the heart rip,

there's always the hope
it can be returned.

Probably heart.
That's what I'll take.

The shadow... I don't know.
You've lost a sense of yourself.

Just take the heart, crush it.

It really looked like
when Greg Mendell's shadow

was ripped from him, it was painful.

I would say having your heart ripped out

has some degree of pain.

It looks like they're in shock, though,

because the minute
they see their own heart,

it's more like, "what just happened?"

It's like taking off a band-aid.
It happens really fast...

...and then you're okay.
They both suck, is the truth.

Emma!

You foolish girl.

Love is weakness.

I think
it's important for the show

to sort of have those dark moments

so that you can have the light
at the other side.

I think that's why people
like it, is because...

No...
...We feel the sense of hope and love.

It's strength.

Even though these characters

live in a fairy-tale world
and they're fantastical,

they're all very human,
and they go through

universal things
that everybody goes through.

I went to Regina's house
and she ripped out my heart.

It had started to blacken
because of what I did.

No.

But I think
that's the way it should be.

Every journey that's worth
taking is never easy, right?

We'll find another way. I know it.

What makes you so sure?

This does.

And I know it better than anyone.

What if it fails?

There is power in believing.

The magic wardrobe? It's a long shot.

We all know this,
so how can you be so sure?

Because I have the one thing
you need now more than anything.

Hope.

We wanted to do something that
really embraced this idea

that, you know, in this world,

no matter how bad things get
or how bad things seem,

you can have hope.

Love is hope.

And if you're in it,
you need to enjoy it.

And that is a powerful thing
that can guide you through life.

And how hard it is
to have it and believe in it

and believe that your life
can get better.

If you have hope and you have
belief and you keep going,

you'll find the answer.

Where's the good in telling them
when there is no hope?

Oh, if there's one thing
I've gleaned from you hero-types

it's that there's always hope.

I remember I was brought to tears

by a speech that Mary Margaret gave...

I gave the book to him
because I wanted Henry

to have the most important thing
anyone can have.

...when she talked about hope
and how important it is to hope.

Believing in even the
possibility of a happy ending

is a very powerful thing.

I believe that the heart of "Once
Upon a Time" is truly hope.

We all hope for the best in life.

Snow!

Charming.

We all hope that we're gonna be happy.

You found me.

Belief gives you hope,
and it gives you courage,

and it gives you conviction.

Hyah!
It gives you strength.

No! Wait!

You're... a girl.

Woman.

The first
Snow/Charming back story

fulfilled all of my little-girl dreams

about what being in a fairy tale
would be.

You can't hide from me!

Wherever you are, I will find you!

I think that mostly

when Snow White and Prince Charming met,

they were impressed with each other.

I told you I'd find you.

Aren't you a real Prince Charming.

I have a name, you know.
Don't care.

Charming suits you.

Now cut me down, Charming.

Snow and Charming
are absolute equals, for sure.

Aah!

I felt like these were
really incredible characters

and a lot of really strong
women characters.

We don't have
any damsels in distress here

who are waiting for a man
to come and save them.

It's the Queen! Run!

She's not a queen anymore.

In the wedding scene, Snow White
draws Prince Charming's sword.

She's nothing more than an evil witch.

No, no, no. Don't stoop to her level.

You know, there has not been
a lot of ball-gown wearing.

These women can all
take care of themselves.

And so I like wearing the britches.

And to be honest,
they're easier to move in.

Well, the wardrobe kind
of puts you there immediately.

We are very lucky to have
such an amazing department...

and hair and makeup.

Everyone just looks beautiful.

Is that any way to address a queen?

I think I'd like to be the Evil Queen.

She's got these crazy outfits.

And I think it'd be fun
to wear those outfits.

No, this won't do.

What are you doing?

When we meet young
Regina, she's very innocent.

Her hair's pulled back. She has braids.

And then after the loss of
Daniel, she starts to transform.

And it happens over a course of years.

The Queen is dead.

Long live the Evil Queen.

That's been fun just to kind of
look at the stories

and go, "okay.
Well, where are we in her life?"

And that sort of manifests
in how she dresses.

Our makeup artists will, you
know, give her a lighter cheek

or, you know, sometimes we do
a lot of shadowing on the side

when she's the full-on,
you know, Evil Queen.

Leading up to enacting the curse,

her eyes are a bit bigger and crazed,

and the face is different.

I want it to look different.

When you read
a "Once Upon a Time" script,

you can see the scale of it.

You can feel the epic-ness,
if that's a word.

Not just the storytelling,

but the environment
that we get to work in

and the crew that we get to work with.

I love a challenge.

One minute,
you're climbing a beanstalk.

The next minute,
you're talking about pixie dust

and, you know, trying to kill Peter Pan.

It's just an amazing experience

to go into all these different worlds.

There was something about
the trolls on the troll bridge

that we fought.

You know, the character design
of those trolls

that reminded me of the world
of "Labyrinth" and Jim Henson.

I was so taken with those trolls.

You saved me.

How could I let Prince Charming die?

I have a name.

It's James.

It's nice to meet you, James.

One of the great things
about fairy tales

is there's universal truths in them.

And so, for us, it's always
trying to find them

and apply them to our characters.

There's more to life than just
looking for the next fight.

You know, you got to look
for the moments.

Moments?
Yes.

Life is made up of moments...
good ones, bad ones,

but they're all worth living.

That's an idea that's really
woven into the storytelling

every week.

"Hey, take a breath."

"Take a breath and look
at what's around you."

We have this idea
of how things should unfold.

But sometimes we're missing the signs

that are right before our eyes.

We have to start our family now.

I don't follow.

Regina will always be a problem.

If not her, there will be
someone or something else.

There will always be something else.

You never know what's
gonna happen five minutes from now,

so living in the moment
is a very important message

that I think comes across really nicely.

We have to find the good moments

in between all of the bad ones.

What better way to make a good moment

than with a child?

Who are you?

These characters have journeyed
to many realms...

Well, I really liked Wonderland

even though I was only there
for one episode.

I just found it fascinating.

What's the name of this place?

The Enchanted Forest
is obviously the realm

that we've explored the most.

It's good to be back.

Storybrooke is where Snow White
is probably happiest,

but I really like
the pomp and circumstance

of the Enchanted Forest.

This is truly a night for celebration.

...but of all the worlds
they've explored...

Only one runs on imagination.

Is that it?

Aye. Neverland.

I remember getting
a book of fairy tales,

and I saw Peter Pan,
and I just fell in love with it.

The idea that you can go to a place

that is built
by your imagination and fly...

I just loved the whole idea.

Neverland is a place
where imagination runs wild.

Their mission... to save Henry.

But this land would present
enormous challenges.

Well, for us, Neverland was a place

that makes you confront your
past because there is no future.

Since you don't grow up,

all you have is the present
and your past.

Hide it where no one can find it.

For Rumplestiltskin,

coming to Neverland
is a homecoming of sorts.

He is going to be facing his father,

who became Peter Pan.

The twist on Peter Pan
is that he's very, very different

than the Peter Pan that we would
all know and love, I guess.

He's quite a nasty character.

Why did you bring me here?

For quite some time, I've sought
something extremely important...

the heart of the truest believer.

Peter Pan is desperate
to hold on to eternal youth.

You are the lucky owner
of that very special heart.

You and it are mine.

Somebody who wants to be 14
for the rest of their lives,

you know,

there's probably something
a little off about them.

Come on, boys!

Let's play.

I really enjoyed Neverland.

I enjoyed that we were all
on that journey together,

that we all had
a really focused mission,

that we all needed to save Henry.

What did we call ourselves
at the beginning of this year?

The Nevengers.

Henry!

Hi, Emma.

For us, it's about belief.

It's Emma believing
in herself as a leader.

You know, Henry had the heart
of the truest believer,

and we had to go find him.

Aah!

Oh!

Unh!

David.

I'm good.

Where's Henry? Where is he?

Emma identified more
with the orphans on the island

even though her parents were there.

That boy with the knife,
you stopped fighting him.

Why?

Because when I looked
at his face, I saw me...

just a lost little girl

who cried herself to sleep at night

'cause she wanted her parents so bad.

For Snow White, she's also
realizing she missed 28 years.

We were cheated out of everything...

her first step, her first word,
her first smile.

When we get off this island
and get back to Storybrooke,

I want to have another baby.

And whether or not they do,
we'll have to wait and see.

You sure you don't want me
to take a look at that?

I was lucky. My jacket wasn't.
Don't worry about it.

Snow White and Prince Charming
find themselves in Neverland

challenged in a new way.

You know, Charming,
in the process of being heroic,

he's poisoned.

He spent most of Neverland
thinking he was going to die.

In this canteen is the water
that will stop the dreamshade

that will save your life.

If it wasn't for Hook,
I wouldn't be alive.

I thought he deserved a little credit.

Thank you.

This is a different Captain Hook

that's returning to Neverland.

Did you really save his life?

That surprise you?

He has given up on vengeance.

He realizes it is a hollow pursuit

and that his real pursuit is Emma.

Well, perhaps gratitude is in order now.

I think Hook has been
a big surprise for her.

I think she did not have
high expectations for him

based on knowing the little bit
that she knew about his past

and him being a pirate.

You couldn't handle it.

Perhaps you are the one
who couldn't handle it.

Emma's a tough nut to crack
on a romantic level.

She is, but I think Hook likes that.

He sort of likes a challenge.

That was...

A one-time thing.

Don't follow me. Wait five minutes.

Go get some firewood or something.

As the search for Henry continued,

a familiar face returned to Neverland.

Going back to Neverland for Neal

was kind of like going back
to the old neighborhood.

Welcome home, Baelfire.

It's a place that Neal had spent
some time, knew how to operate.

Pan's shadow?
That's your way off the island?

Unfortunately, it's the only way.

That's why we have to capture it.

Capture it?

We've never been within 10 feet of Pan

unless he wanted us to be.
I know where to look.

Emma, Neal, and Hook search the
darkest corners of the island.

Is that Pan's shadow?

Let us go!

Their encounter shed light on feelings

that could not be ignored.

We almost lost our shot
at capturing the shadow

because you two were
fighting over a lighter!

It wasn't the lighter
we were fighting over, love.

It's interesting to be
even thinking about the idea

of a love triangle because
so often what Emma's focused on

is saving Henry.

Let me be very clear about something.

If I had to choose someone,

I choose Henry.

He's the only love
I have room for in my life.

Emma's so much more than any
single relationship in her life.

By the end of her time
in Neverland, she was a leader.

This land is run on belief.

It's time for all of us to believe...

not in magic, but in each other.

A hero, a villain, a pirate...

it doesn't matter which
because we're gonna need

all those skills whether
we can stomach them or not.

And what's your skill, Savior?

I'm a mother.

There's something
about all of our characters

coming together...
the villains and the heroes.

It's been so much fun.

Henry. Are you okay?

Henry, can you hear me?

Y... you're here.

Yes, we're coming to get you.

It's always nice to have,
you know, a team

and a family behind you to fight
for you and fight with you.

Regina's found that in
the Charmings, strangely enough.

Regina and the heroes worked as one.

Pan was stopped.

And Henry was safe.

Hold on, Henry.

And together, they journeyed home.

A lot of the characters
in Neverland this year

are people who lost something.

Their dream was taken from them.

And in a lot of ways,
Neverland showed them

to continue to have faith and believe.

You think it will fly?

It has no choice.

Because sometimes
you have to be ready

to receive the happy ending.

And sometimes our happy endings
aren't what we think they are.

A triumphant return home
brought family together.

He's back.

You know, I think "Once Upon a Time"
presents family

as something that's extremely important.

It's about family in a world
where anything's possible.

That, at the end of the day,
is most important.

I didn't believe we were all
gonna make it out of that place.

Well, we did.

And we owe a lot of it to her.

Regina helped save us all.

It's not about
going to the ball.

It's not about meeting a prince.

It's about finding home.

But this happy homecoming
included an uninvited guest.

Look at you all... a captive audience.

Hard to tell which one to kill first.

Stay away from them.

For Rumplestiltskin,

he has deep, deep issues
with his father,

and he knows that it's probably
not a confrontation

he's going to survive.

I love you, Bae.

And I love you, Belle.

You made me stronger.

Everything Rumple has ever done
was to let his son know

that he regretted giving him up,

something his own father
never did for him.

Aah!

In that episode that we saw

when Rumple stabs his father

and... that is just heartbreaking.

But I feel like you have to
break the cycle somewhere,

and that's what he was doing.

What we saw was a man

making the ultimate sacrifice
for his family.

Hello, papa.

Rumple, please.

We can start over.

We can have a happy ending.

Ah, but I'm a villain.

And villains don't get happy endings.

That's because he maybe thinks
that, "you don't deserve it."

And that your actions through your life

dictate what you're gonna get
at the end of it.

Rumple sacrificed himself

his son, for Belle, and for everybody.

He left this world

with his son knowing that he loved him.

Rumple!

H... he's gone!

Despite Rumple's heroism,

the damage had already been done.

Pan unleashed Regina's curse...

It's here!

...which brought an entirely
new set of consequences.

The curse! It's here!

It's coming!

There's no escape.

I have no choice.
I have to undo what I started.

We hear from Regina what
the cost of this curse is,

which is that, you know,
she can never see her son again,

and our fairy-tale characters
can't come back.

Breaking the curse destroys the town.

You'll go back to the Enchanted Forest.

All of us... except Henry.

You will take him
because you're the Savior.

And once again, you can escape it.

With these characters,
anything is possible.

Bad can become good, and good
isn't all that it seems to be,

and that all the people in our world

are deserving of a happy ending

no matter what they've been
through or what they've done.

It's all my fault.

It wasn't your fault. It's mine.

I cast a curse out of vengeance.

I think there's a moral
in all of our stories

that we tell in every episode.

I'm a villain.

You're not a villain.

You're my mom.

There's a lot of lessons
to learn from our show,

and that's kind of what fairy
tales were always about anyhow.

There's not a day will go by
I won't think of you.

Good.

"Once Upon a Time"
is a really extensive look

at how much hope and faith
it takes to be "happy."

When the curse washes over us,
it will send us all back.

Nothing will be left behind,
including your memories.

When you cross that town line,

you will have the life
you always wanted.

It's about hope,
and it's always been about hope.

And it's about the belief that
no matter how bad things are,

no matter how bad things seem,

if you just keep that faith
and you keep that belief,

someday they'll get better.

It's how you get to it
that can be the challenge

and what you do with it when
you get it that's important.

We really wanted the season

to feel like two different seasons.

So the first half was really
concentrated on Neverland,

and it was about belief.

And the second half of the season

is really going to explore
what "home" means.

And we always said when we created Emma

that she was a character
looking for home.

But because she never had one,
she doesn't know what it is.

Someone coming over?

No.

Henry, wait here.

Swan.

At last.
W... do I know you?

Look. I need your help.
Something's happened...

something terrible...
your family is in trouble.

My family's right here. Who are you?

An old friend.

I know you can't remember me,
but... I can make you.

Unh!

What the hell are you doing?

A long shot. I had to try.
I was hoping you felt as I did.

All you're gonna feel is the
handcuffs when I call the cops.

Look, I know this seems crazy,

but you have to listen to me.

You have to remem...

Who was that?
No idea.

Someone must have left
the door open downstairs.

Come on. Let's eat.
