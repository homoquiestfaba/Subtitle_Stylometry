(BELL TRILLING)

RINGO: <i>In a five-year period, 19,000
bank robberies were reported to the FBI.</i>

<i>So, that means there were
19,000 bank robbers</i>

<i>who didn't do
their job correctly.</i>

<i>Who wants the FBI on their ass?</i>

<i>Nah, man. I say, if you gonna rob a
bank, make sure it ain't reported.</i>

<i>Funny thing about
safe deposit boxes...</i>

<i>ain't nothing safe about them.</i>

("HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW" PLAYING)

<i>â™ª Now there was a time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you loved me so... â™ª</i>

RINGO: <i>None of the shit
in the boxes is insured.</i>

<i>Try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government,</i>

<i>you'll get the middle finger
in fine print.</i>

<i>So who would use
a safe deposit box?</i>

<i>Stupid people.</i>

<i>And criminals.</i>

<i>Now, I ain't got no problem
with stupid people,</i>

<i>as long as their stupidity
don't hurt nobody.</i>

<i>The owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad</i>

<i>who hides his income so he
doesn't have to pay child support.</i>

<i>How you gonna do that
to your own kid?</i>

<i>Let me be clear. I never steal
from people who don't deserve it.</i>

<i>And what I steal, always goes
back to those who've been harmed.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKING)

<i>That handsome black man?
Yeah, that's me. Ringo.</i>

<i>Yeah, Ringo, like the Beatle.</i>

<i>And don't start with that
John, Paul, George shit,</i>

<i>'cause I ain't got time
to get into it.</i>

<i>What you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise.</i>

<i>I'm a black chameleon, baby.</i>

<i>And I'm empty-handed.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKING)

RINGO: <i>'Cause when those a-holes
discover their boxes are empty,</i>

<i>they'll get pissed.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKING)

RINGO: <i>They'll yell
at the bank manager,</i>

<i>the bank manager might even let
him see the security footage,</i>

<i>but he will also explain what I already
told you... That shit ain't insured.</i>

<i>One thing they will not do
is report it to the FBI,</i>

<i>'cause roaches hide
from the light.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKING)

RINGO: <i>And in about six months, I'll empty
my safe deposit box and close my account.</i>

<i>And I will write
a few wrongs, anonymously.</i>

Oh my God, David,
pack your things!

RINGO: <i>Turns out I'm not the only
one who feels good about doing good.</i>

<i>That little dude,
his name is Wick.</i>

<i>As a kid he heard
some Chinese story</i>

<i>about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits.</i>

<i>There's two things you need
to know about Wick.</i>

<i>First off...</i>


<i>And eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up.</i>

(CAMERA CLICKING)

RINGO: <i>Dude made a mint in Vegas when
they decided to remodel the whole city.</i>

<i>Second, he's still the same
kid I first told you about.</i>

<i>He's still goofy as hell, still has the
same haircut, still looks like he's 12...</i>

<i>and he still believes firecrackers
can chase away evil spirits.</i>

<i>This was a drug
manufacturing plant.</i>

<i>Wick made sure no drugs would
ever come out of here again.</i>

<i>Now I wasn't there,</i>

<i>but I think it went a little
something like this.</i>

(BELL TOLLING)

RINGO: <i>That there is Violet.</i>

<i>Right now she in a church in
some shitty Eastern Euro country.</i>

<i>She just recently freed a bunch of
young girls from a sex trafficking ring.</i>

<i>And those are some
shitty Eastern Euro thugs</i>

<i>who are about to join a long list of men
who underestimated Violet's girl power.</i>

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

RINGO: <i>Yo, it was like some
Matrix-style shit.</i>

<i>Now I ain't saying she
defied gravity or anything,</i>

<i>'cause I wasn't there.</i>

<i>But I do know only one person
walked out of there that day.</i>


RINGO: <i>About a year ago,
we didn't know each other.</i>

<i>That all changed with a bouquet
of flowers. Three bouquets.</i>

<i>Seemed our good deeds landed on
the radar of some philanthropist.</i>

<i>It was an offer
to step up our game.</i>

<i>Why take down a street hustler when you
can go after international corruption.</i>

<i>We became a team. We tried
to come up with a cool name.</i>

<i>The Robin Hoods.</i>

<i>Nah, I ain't going for any
name calling us no damn hoods.</i>

<i>Wick even suggested the Motley
Crew, with a straight face.</i>

<i>Hell nah. But I like
the Misfits.</i>

<i>Not everyone agreed
on the name, but eff that.</i>

<i>I'm telling the story,
So the Misfits it is.</i>

<i>Anyway, the next chapter in our
story started a little while ago</i>

<i>in a prison in Los Angeles.</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

WARDEN: <i>The FBI is here to extradite
inmate 272523 to Mr. Schultz's prison.</i>

WARDEN: Where?
England.

Mr. Schultz runs
a privatized prison there,

this particular inmate,
Richard Pace, broke out.

And you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape?

Wife issues.

RINGO: <i>Wife issues is Latin
for this prisoner</i>

<i>was laying pipe
to Schultz's wife.</i>

<i>And for Schultz...
that caused some issues.</i>

WARDEN: Wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation.

HASSAN:
Mr. Schultz isn't a warden.

WARDEN: No, he's a senior partner
in a multinational company

which happens to own, among other
things, prisons all over the planet.

Coming up on the right here.
440, open 312.

OFFICER 2: <i>Copy 21, opening now.</i>

<i>Name's Richard Pace...
you should know.</i>

Come back 440?

OFFICER 2: <i>Well, we just got
paperwork for his immediate release.</i>

<i>The judge apparently
threw out the charges.</i>

(DOOR THUDS)

SCHULTZ:
That's not Richard Pace.

He is good, though.

This is Pace this morning from the
prison exercise yard. Look at this.

There. Right there.

Look. I'm just spitballing here,
but I think that was a drone.

All right, if that's the drone,
what's the payload?

Could have been key-cards, it could've
been a birthday cake with a hacksaw in it.

All we know is that we've searched
this installation from top to bottom.

Richard Pace isn't here.

I don't get it. If he was going
to be released in 24 hours,

why break out?

Probably because there was
something he needed to do today...

not tomorrow.

You are...

Hanni.
Hanni.

Hanni Abu Assad.

Right.

So...

where's Pace?

How would I know?

Well, you bunked with him
for three months.

It seems that he did
that intentionally

because you had something
to tell him, something...

valuable to tell him.

I don't know.

Right.

Well, maybe...

you will feel better...
talking to me in... private.

(ELECTRICITY SHUTS DOWN)

GUARD: Power went down.
WARDEN: Damn it.

Now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon.

(GRUNTING)
(PUNCHES LANDING)

WARDEN: What's going on?

SCHULTZ: Look at that.

I know where Pace is.

Excuse me.

RINGO: <i>Hell yeah,
he know where Pace was.</i>

<i>He just beat the info out of poor
Hanni with a damn cell phone.</i>

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

RINGO: <i>Turns out,
Hanni used to be the valet</i>

<i>of Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani.</i>

<i>Pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit</i>

<i>like travel into Los Angeles
once a year</i>

<i>for a single day of shopping.</i>

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

PRINCE: My usual.
MAN: Next round on the house.

RINGO: <i>He also never traveled without
his high-value collection of timepieces.</i>

<i>That's expensive-ass watches.</i>

Girard-Joseph Grand Ellava.

Gold, platinum, 23 carats,
D color, flawless diamonds.

One of only two ever made.

Whoo. (SCOFFS)

Richard Pace.

Pleased to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

You're Kuwaiti, huh?

I have a daughter who works
in the Middle East, UNICEF.

Charitable work, children, refugees and...
something like that.

So, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

...how much does a watch
like that go for?

Four, five mill...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

I do apolo... I'm so sorry.
PRINCE: Really.

Please, please, please.
Just let me, there you go.

It's fine.
You got some right there.

Oops, I do apologize.

If you don't mind.
Yes, okay.

My fault, I've had
too much to drink

it's just one of those days.
Okay. Time to go.

GUARD: Hello.

Hello.

What you got there?

GUARD: Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani?

It's an old picture.

Do you want to go
and talk about this?

Hmm, no, not really.

Yeah, he wants to go
and talk about it.


(THUDS)
(GRUNTING)


It's an honest living.

Penthouse.
AGENT: Hold up.

You don't have any
jurisdiction or authority here.

You let the FBI
handle this.

GUARD: You heard him.
Knock yourself out.

Here you go.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


(ELEVATOR DINGS)


(DOOR RATTLING)

MAN 1: Go to the bedroom.
MAN 2: Copy that.

I'm going to go wash up.

You go through the first door.
I'll go through the second.

My watches are gone!

How are we doing?

We had some company.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Almost there.

How we doing?

We are almost there. Yeah.

GUARD: Clear.
(DOOR OPENING)

GUARD 1: Hey!
GUARD 2: Hey!

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

Gentlemen, I had a lovely stay.
Your car is waiting for you.

Surprise!


Ah, thank you.

Nice to see you again.
Good to see you too, uh,

Prince Al Zahrani?
No, I made that up.

RINGO: <i>This is the Prince. Not Prince
Al Zahrani. He made that shit up.</i>

<i>He claims to be a prince from some
country nobody's ever heard of.</i>

<i>But that don't matter.
What matters is...</i>

<i>remember the philanthropist who
sent the flowers? This is that dude.</i>

Shall we?
Let's roll. Like right now.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

All right, bring the cars
around, let's go. Let's go.

(ENGINE REVVING)


Thank you. These are mine.

So this is a con?

RINGO: <i>Con seems pretty inadequate
to describe what we did.</i>

<i>We even hired the dude to
play Hanni as Pace's cellmate.</i>

<i>Yeah, we probably gon' have to
give that dude some worker's comp.</i>

Color me minorly
impressed, but why?

Simple. We need you, you don't need us.
For that, we needed leverage.

PRINCE: You know what they call a serious
crime captured on multiple hotel cameras?

Leverage. Now,
you need us. Simple.

Who exactly is us?
Me and my friends.

(INHALES, EXHALES)

You don't have to come with us.

Up to you.

What are we waiting for?

(PLANE TAKING OFF)

What the hell did Pace do to
Schultz's wife that was so bad?

Let's just say Mrs. Schultz
isn't the one upset by it.

Oh. Oh...

Here's to my kidnapping. Whoo!

Kidnapping requires a element
of force, no force here.

You're free to go
whenever you want.

There's an exit sign
right behind you.

Yeah. Well, maybe I'll
just pass on that one.


The name's Ringo.

That's Violet. That's my man
Wick over there.

You already had a chance to meet the
con artist formerly known as Prince.

Is this some kind of criminal organization?
Nah, not criminal at all.

Just a few people trying
to do what's right.

Well, you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what I do.

You got quite the reputation.

Yeah, the only thing that
you better at

than stealing
people's shit is getting caught.

And escaping.
You're a damn legend.

How many of Schultz's
prisons did he escape?

By my count, four, give or take.

Four prisons?
Built by the same guy?

But you know who don't love it?

Schultz.
RINGO: Mm-mm.

He don't love it at all.

And that don't have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife.

Schultz didn't come to extradite
you back to his prison.

Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

Judging by your contributions to society thus
far, I can't say it was the wrong choice.

But we're giving you
a chance to turn things around.

Oh great, lucky me.

Look, all you have to know is we got
the same piece of shit on our shoes,

Werner Schultz.

RINGO: <i>Shit doesn't even
start to explain.</i>

<i>He even owns prisons
in the Middle East.</i>

<i>Schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand,</i>

<i>so he partnered
with the Muslim Brotherhood.</i>

<i>The local terrorist organization
in some country called Jazeristan.</i>

Well, you know Schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones.

But terrorism? Well,
that's a bit of a stretch.

Yeah, you'd think
until Schultz realized

that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

Yeah. A hard-partying Arab
by the name of Jason Quick.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

RINGO: <i>They got him
for everything.</i>

<i>Drugs, possession,
weapon solicitation you name it.</i>

I am back, bitches!

RINGO: <i>Schultz just up
and let him go.</i>

Turns out that Jason Quick is actually
Jasim bin something or something.

One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood's son.

And when Schultz released him,
it granted him favor with this man.

Abu Hirawa.
Real name is Am-jam...

(SPEAKS ARABIC)

What he had to say.

For all intents and purposes,
Bin Laden's successor.

So... (CLEARS THROAT) ...Schultz
is in bed with this guy.

In bed, under the covers with some KY
Jelly doing all kinds of freaky shit.

Why are you telling me?
'Cause you're a thief.

Let me stop you right there.
Yes, I'm a thief...

but I only steal from upstanding
citizens who pay insurance.

Nobody gets hurt.
Particularly me.

Besides... I only work alone.

And if that changes, and it won't...
none of you will make the cut.


There's millions of dollars worth
of gold in one of those locations.

I like gold.

VIOLET: Terrorism generates
a lot of cash, kidnappings,

drugs, oil, theft,
but it's all dirty.

It's traceable. In order
to launder the money...

Gold.
RINGO: Oh yeah. Gold.

Hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in,

unless they're forced to.

A prison?

Oh, not just any old prison.
Your boy Schultz's prison.

We're goin' in.
You want to join us?

You want me to go
into a Middle Eastern country,

one that you've been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time,

that is filled with terrorists,
to steal their gold.

Yeah.
That's exactly what we want you to do.

In other words, something good,
for once.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)


Oh, that's rich. That's rich.

Let me see... (CLEARS THROAT)
...how do I put this, I got it.

Nope.

And if it makes
you feel any better,

I'm pretty sure every
one of you is insane.

Especially this dude
sitting over here.

Excuse me. We on descent.
Please fasten your seatbelts. Thanks.


You know, I guess I should
have asked this sooner,

descent to where?

To Abu Dhabi.

Abu Dhabi.

Hey man, Schultz's new besties,

the dudes in the grey suits,
Muslim Brotherhood.

They'll try to kill
you again, you know.

You change your mind,
there's a card in your left breast pocket.

Call us.
PACE: Arrivederci.

My, my, would you look at this?

Taxi?


Let's roll.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

single malt whiskey. Two ice cubes.

It's a good-looking watch.

Leon LaFleur Magnifique. 769
working parts,

each one created by a single craftsman
at an atelier in Switzerland.

I believe, only four of them
ever made in the world.

Huh. Impressive.

Wonder how this
wallet got down here?

Huh. Your wallet.

No, it's not.

And I rather drink alone.
I actually insist on it.

Okay, fair play.

All right. <i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
Good luck to yourself.

PACE: Sorry.

Hi, gin and tonic, please.

I don't believe it.

Oh, excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

Oh, thank you so much.
What a pleasure meeting you.

Yes, you too.
Where are you from?

I'm from the states. Um, I travel...
Ma'am.

I believe you
dropped your pocketbook.

Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

I literally just picked that up in the gift shop.
I bet you did.

But you know, you must be more careful the
world is rife with thieves and cutpurses.

Don't I know it. Which is why I
bought the cheapest one I could...

and keep my real one...
close to me heart.

Is there anything else you
keep close to your heart?

Let me see, um...
the trials of the poor,

the downtrodden, tribulations
of the world's oppressed.

Otherwise, no, not a thing.

Sounds like a lonely existence.

No, actually,
it's quite fulfilling and lacks little.

Sometimes...

things are missing in our lives
and we don't even know it.

Things tend to stay missing if
you don't actually look for them.

(CLEARS THROAT) If you don't mind,
the lady and I were having a conversation.

Really now, that's very funny

because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

In fact, if I recall,
you insisted.

Go. Find your own.
This one is mine.

Huh! What did you say?
She's my new friend.

Really?

That's very interesting because actually...
she's my daughter.

And I don't know you, friend.

The gentleman, he had
to run away there,

but he said for his drinks,
our drinks on his room. Thank you so much.

That was a very
swift move back there.

Yeah. Well, I had
quite the teacher.

It's good to see you, Hope.
It really is.

You too, Dad.

So, how'd you end up
in Abu Dhabi?

Same way I ended up in prison.
Against my will.

And you?

I'm... I'm here to meet
some philanthropist.

We're talking through new,
innovative ways to help the refugee crisis.

That's good. Impressive.
Yeah, it is.

And when I was in the hotel lobby,
I saw another crisis developing.

Well, old habits.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

Hey, listen.

Let's go for a walk, shall we? It's been a while.
Yeah, okay.

Maybe on second thoughts...

Very nice.
Pay the bill here...

Here you go.

Have you seen your mother?

She's my mom, so, yeah.

How is she?
(INHALES) Yeah, she's fine.

Re-married.
Hmm.

Took her a long time, but she got over it.
That's good.

Yeah.

That's really good.

How about you, how're you doing?
You... married yet?

No, I'm not married.
I, uh... (INHALES)

I have trouble trusting men.

Daddy issues.


Look, Hope, I know this
sounds like a cliche,

but I did it for you and it was
the right thing to do at the time.

Why? Because you're
just so wrong?

Yeah.
(SCOFFS)

PACE: It was.

You know what the sad thing, I mean the
real tragedy of this whole thing is?

You actually believe that.

But I know deep down,
under all that

urbane panache and capricious
thievery, you're good.

Just gotta find that person.

Yeah, well that's
easier said than done.

Perhaps, I could steal him.
(CHUCKLES)

I have to go. I'm sorry.
I have to go prepare for this meeting.

Okay.

It's good to see you.
Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad.

Bye.
Bye.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


Okay. I'm in.

But if I do this,
and this comes off,

it's because of what
I bring to the table.

I'm in charge.
What I say goes, no exceptions.

We can live with that.
It's why we picked you.

And the split? Tch. Not even,
not five ways. 50/50 boom, boom.

Split of what?
The money. The gold.

There won't be any.
What do you mean there won't be any,

I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

It is. But that doesn't mean
they'll be any gold to split.

Well, why the hell not?
Because it's not about us.

It's about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism.

Right, I get that. Steal
their gold, stop the terrorists.

To the victor goes the spoils.

There are no victors, Pace.

We're never going to be able
to stop the Muslim Brotherhood,

but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off.

We do what we do to help
others, never ourselves.


PACE: Oh my God,
here we go again.

If this weren't so amusing...
it would be sad.


RINGO: Pace.

Pace. Pace!

Look, I'm not sure how you
got hold of your information

or who told you I might even have any
interest in this act of compassion,

but they were wrong.
I did.

I told them.

I told you had a meeting about the
refugee crisis. This is that meaning.

Oh, for God's sake.

Don't tell me they brought you in, too.
No, I pulled them.

This is my idea.

Hope, listen to me,
if any of this is true,

contact the embassy,
talk to a congressman.

We tried.

VIOLET: Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

in the Middle East. America doesn't
need to ask too many questions,

and Jazeristan doesn't
need to find any answers.

Do they know about this?

They know, but they
don't know, you know?

what am I gonna do here?

This. I want you to do this.

we need you.

I need you.

Just this once, I'm asking
you not to walk out the door.

I must need my head examined.

Yeah, I feel like I should mention
something about Abu Hirawa.

I mean it's kind of his gold
we're after.

In Arabic,
Hirawa means cane.

(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)



And that was this gardener.

Oh well. (CHUCKLES)
That's good to know.

Prison. Hard to get into,
even harder to get out of.

Especially with
a truckload of gold.

First question.
Where's the gold?

We got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land,

but we still don't know
where the vault is.

Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

Yeah, we have. Come, I show you.

Facility is state-of-the-art,
one of the most modern prisons on Earth.

And it's completely self-contained...
food, water, everything.

Wait. Go back.

Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

If the prison's self-sustained,

I would expect there's a fully
functioning laundry on the inside.

Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

That's the steam in the photo.

Mm. Right, but it doesn't,
does it, really?

Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty,

I'm pretty sure...
that's a laundry truck.

Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

an actual industrial laundry.

Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

And built a vault instead.
(LAUGHS)

Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

Right under the shitter.
Let's go to prison, shall we?

Oh, and by the way,
I only fly first class.

Me too!
Oh-ho, congratulations.

Next time we'll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

Mm-hm. What do you
mean, next time?

This entire region
is on high alert.

A group like this, landing at the
airport will attract attention.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
point remains the same.

Trains, planes, automobiles.

I'm flexible...
as long as it's first class.

Hmm?

Why isn't anyone
saying anything?


Please, tell me you're joking!

We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

Which one is Muhammad?
All of them.

Oh.
RINGO: My Muhammad.

There's about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of Jazeristan.

Well..

this prison isn't going
to rob itself. Let's go.

By the way, you look great.
Thank you. Don't be cheeky.

Which camel's mine. Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

What's a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

Believe me, I'm not so nice.

They didn't ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition.

So it's not because
you couldn't find a date.

No, I'm very good
at finding dates.

Even better at losing them.

You might want to change
your line of work.

Could increase your odds.
Says the thief.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

No, I decided a long time ago

that if I can't be good
to someone,

I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

Good philosophy.


You know...

They say that people
on their deathbeds...

never regret
the things they did,

just... the things
they didn't do.

This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

We're going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

If there's some
kind of connection, well...

It would be a shame
if we die

without
really saying our feelings.

Did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die?

Nope. Never crossed my mind.

It's not you, Pace,

from an empirical point of view,

you are a very attractive man.

You see I don't... date men.

I kill them.

One can only try.

(WINDS BLOWING)

PACE: Hey. (GROANS)
HOPE: Hey.


You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Just a little scared.
Yeah.

Well, it certainly
will have its risks.

Uh, I don't mean the prison.

Dad, you're doing this
for the right reasons, right?

I mean... you're not going to do
like you always do and...

disappear in the final frame?

Do you mean...

The gold?
No.

I mean... disappear without me.

Oh, Hope...

I really would like to promise
you that, I really would.

There's a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

Same goes for you.

Hold steady.

Hold steady.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Get some rest.
It's a big day tomorrow.

(MAN PRAYING IN ARABIC)

We'll be fine here.
Why can't I stay with my dad?

It's too risky. We don't want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone.

That's comforting.
Really?

No. It was a joke.

Hm.

Well, we usually don't
like to work with people

who have families
and loved ones.

Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

What are you doing?

You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.


What do you want to do?

Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

I don't drink or take drugs.

Really? Maybe you should start.

Just a little something
to take the edge off.

If you want,
I could go score some.

Absolutely not,
that's dangerous.

I was joking.

God, you really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

Don't really have time for it.

Not much about what I do
is very funny.

Me neither.

You know what? Let's focus on
what we love about our work.

Okay. I like to beat people up.

Okay, cool. Yeah.

Well, let's say I am a guy
and I'm coming at you.

A dumb guy.
Right. Okay.

But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So,

you gotta take me down in one move.
What's your go-to?

One shot?
Yeah, that's it.

Easy. Punch to the throat.

Not the jewels?
No.

Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

What may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure,

but a solid punch
the Adam's apple.

Down in a oner.

Cool.
Hmm!

You must have one badass dad.

Never knew him.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, well, me too.

Well, I for one,
would like to thank him.

If he hadn't abandoned you
and made you hate men so much,

you wouldn't taken up my fight.

That's one way to look at it.

You're lucky to have
a dad like yours.

He loves you a lot.

Yeah, I guess so.

Still an asshole though.


Yeah, he is.

Here.

I thought you didn't drink.
I don't.

Let's cheers to dads.
The good... and the bad.


(MAN PRAYING IN ARABIC)
(PIGEONS COOING)

All right, ladies
and gentlemen pucker up.

Time to move, Ringo,
don't lose interest.

Up you get. Gather round,
ladies and gentlemen.

Okay, take a seat.

The problem with gold is,
well, it's heavy.

So we're gonna need a vehicle

that can handle
that kind of weight.

On it.

And to get it out
of the country,

camels aren't gonna cut it.

So, we're going to need
some kind of transport.

I can.
PACE: You can what?

Some kind of transport,
my country can provide it.

Princey-poo claims
that he's royalty

in a "country" in the Gulf.

I thought you said
you weren't a prince.

I said I wasn't that prince
but I'm a prince in my country.

What country?
You ain't got no country.

Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Ringo.

By the way,
just off the topic here.

Is that your given name?

Yeah, given by me. In honor
of the greatest Beatle.

Here we go again.
What you mean here we go again?

What, a black man
can't like the Beatles?

See, he's a true visionary
with his instrument.

You guys don't understand.
He was the first rock and roll drummer...

influenced every
rock drummer after him.

Even the way that he held his sticks.
Seriously?

I don't joke about Ringo.

It's better just to accept it
and don't karaoke with him.

(CROWD BOOING)

You suck, you suck!

RINGO: <i>How you gonna say "Yellow
Submarine" ain't a real Beatles song?</i>

I'm just saying
he's an unappreciated singer.

I'm so glad I asked.
Ringo, we're gonna need a list

of all the outside
prison contractors.

No doubt.

And you certainly can't
be drilling or tumbling.

We're going to have
to blow the vault.

Hope, you've had experience

with phone boxes in
the Peace Corps, is that right?

Yeah?
I need that skill set.

And anything else I taught you
at a very inappropriate age.

Violet, we need to find
out where Schultz is

when he isn't at the prison.
We need surveillance.

Already on it. And it looks like
you guys better grab your robes.

Schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes.

All right handsome, let's go.

That's what I'm talking about!

(WHEEL SQUEAKS)

Welcome, sir.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CAMERA CLICKS)

PACE: There it is.
Watch that case.

You see how heavy that was?
Like a fat lady.

PACE: Looks like Schultz
is making a withdrawal

for our friend Abu Hirawa.

HOPE: <i>We have to stop him.</i>

I'm sorry, Hope,
you can't win them all.

We don't know who this guy is and by
now, he's just in the wind.

Jason Quick.

Jason Quick? He looks good.

He got the drugs out of his system
and he put the jihad back in.

That other guy in the photo,

it's the Vice President
of the Bank of Jazeristan.

He's trading
the gold for cash.

Yeah, and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

After that, Jason boards
an afternoon flight...

at which point
he will be "in the wind."

What you got there?
What are you reading?

I picked these up at the souk.
Okay.

What?
Nothing.

(SPEAKS IN ARABIC)

(HORN BLOWING)

(SHOUTS IN ARABIC)

(CHATTER IN ARABIC)


I gave your man gold,
it's not my fault he's a thief.

ABU HIRAWA: Was.
I'm sorry?

ABU HIRAWA:
<i>Was a thief. Except that...</i>

He wasn't.
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

ABU HIRAWA: On the journey from is to
was, all men tell the truth.

<i>A man's eyes cannot lie.
Not to me.</i>

Especially when
I hold them in my hand.

If I thought it was you,

we would not be having
this conversation.

Ah, right, well...
that's that then.

If there's nothing else,
I've got a bit of company at the moment.

ABU HIRAWA: There is a very large
operation taking place in the near future,

<i>but you may leave
your briefcase at home.</i>

<i>You need something much
larger for this transaction.</i>

Ah, right,
who's my contact this time?

ABU HIRAWA: <i>Me.</i>
You? Lovely.

ABU HIRAWA: Three days.
SCHULTZ: <i>All right, thanks.</i>

VIOLET: Oh shit.

Agreed.

Hirawa's coming
here to get his gold.

That's the bad news. The piss
in our punch bowl bad news...

is this guy.

Khairat Reda is
a London-based banker.

Top brass of the Brotherhood and
he arrives here in three days.

Hirawa is the finger puppet.
And this man is the hand.

So we accelerate the schedule.
Hit the prison before they get there.

Uh-uh. We can't go into this thing
half-cocked. We're not ready.

I'm ready. Are you ready?

Huh! We are fully cock.

Cocked, not cock.
Yes, cock.

Yes, cock for you,
no cock for me.

I need a drink.

Okay, here we go.

The only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly

is if the prison
isn't running smoothly.

Fortunately, we got a few guys
on the inside.

PACE: <i>And working in the place
where we have direct control</i>

over the prisoners'
physical well-being.

Any health issue that
needs more than ten beds...

PACE: <i>Well...</i>

We gotta get them out, now!

Let's just say they're going
to need more than that.

(SIRENS WAILING)

And we walk out the front door.
Well, maybe not.

Let's play that one by ear,
shall we?

Abdullah, are you aware of how many
violations you have going on here?

No, we just passed
inspection a few months ago.

Now, I'm asking, where are you buying
all of your refrigeration equipment from?

Pacific Industries. Yes.
They're still in business?

Well, you need to get them
on the phone right away.

We can get some new steamers
down here, get you up to code.

You're with the ministry
of Public Health, Mr., uh...

<i>Lionel L. Zagred?</i>
RINGO: <i>I am.</i>

I have a friend there. Maybe I should
call him so I can sort this out.

Are you aware of the GSO?

<i>The Gulf Standard Organization.</i>

They're responsible for all
of the food development

and standards going on
here in the Gulf region.

So you could only imagine how it'd
probably look if such a prized institution

were to fail an inspection.

Now, if you ask me personally,
Jazeristan shouldn't care

about the opinions
of other countries, right?

So if you want... you want
to call your friend,

you get him on the horn, call them, right away!
They're not friends.

It won't be me that will be
upsetting the royal family.

GUARD: <i>It's my friend's cousin,
and I don't even know him.</i>


MAN: <i>Pacific Industrial?</i>

Would you happen to
have any of the...

Vanguard K2350.

Vanguard K2350 in stock, please?

You do? Great. I want two sent
as quickly as possible.

To the Dola Penal
Corrections Institute.

What do you mean you
don't have any at hand?

You just literally two seconds
ago told me you had five.

This is not good.

You do that!
(THUD)

What did they say?
It seems they don't have any, at hand.

But they can rush order them to
us and have them to us in a week.

Mm-Hmm!
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

Answer that phone, Abdullah.

RINGO: (WHISPERS) Answer that.
(WHISPERS) What if it's the royal family?

Answer the phone.

(TELEPHONE CLICKING)

Hello, sir. This is Pacific
Industrial here.

I'd like to apologize for the
mix-up we had over here on our end.

<i>We do in fact have
the 2350 in stock.</i>

<i>We had an unexpected
delivery cancellation.</i>

In fact, one of our men
is in the field as we speak.

Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay for you?

That would be fantastic.
I can't thank you enough for this.

That's very kind of you, sir,
much appreciated, good day now.

Cup of coffee?


All right. We go in
after lunch tomorrow.

Hey, Violet, couldn't have
found a small worker?

No, it just so happened that the biggest
lush at the company was also very large.

Is this blood on here?
Good luck.

WICK: Violet!


But I do need you to fill out a little
bit more information right here.

But they haven't been cleared!
Abdullah, focus!

For your family.
Oh yes, I'll get them cleared.

Sign. Sign. Right away.
Please, yes, yes. Watch your step.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

WICK: Whoa, whoa.

(SCREW CLINKING)
Dude, you have anger issues.

Started from childhood.
Come on.

That ought to do it, let's go
check on their progress.

No, they will handle it.
They will let us know.

I'm a soon-to-be captain,
you cannot keep treating me like this!

Let's go check
on their progress.

Okay, Abdullah, you're
so angry, let's go.

(DOOR OPENING)

(RINGO INDISTINCT YELLING)

Age before beauty.

RINGO: All these new steamers,
this has worked out famously!

Abdullah, K2350.

(MOUTHING)
They look the same.

But how closely
have you examined?

Not so much.
Exactly.

See, same chassis?
Internal component entirely different.



No.

(MACHINE TURNING OFF)

What are you doing?
You have to break-in first.

Right?

I mean... They are your steamers,
if you want to turn on,

you break, you buy,
you own the steamers!

No, no, I don't,
the royal family does.

When can we use them?
Eh... an hour or two.

Give the internal
component time to break in.

I love that you
listen to me now.

This is like we
build a relationship.

I feel like I must hug. I hug.

I'm... I'm sorry.

Part of my culture.
I'm... I'm European.

You're European.
Yes.

Finnish. From... from Finland.
Oh.

We big on hugs. We are,
big hug. I love to hug.

Oh yes, yes, yes...

Oh yes, now I have one more
thing for you to do.

For you to sign and then
I'm out of your hair, I finish!

Okay.


Wow.


Seemed like a good idea
a few days ago.

This is going to take
a bloody miracle.

Indeed.

Let's go. We've got
a busy morning ahead.

Bon Appetit.

Born up a tree.

(COUGHING, VOMITING)

(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

(COUGHING, VOMITING)

It's amazing the bacteria you can
find at a local university, huh?

They really should protect it
better, you know that.

I hope there's
no harmful side effects.

Sure, there shouldn't be those.


ABDULLAH: Get these people
to the infirmary immediately!

And for God sakes,
have someone clean this up. Now!

Well?
GUARD: We're not sure, sir.

But a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing

some sign of poisoning,
acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

It could be
some sort of overdose.

So...

All this is just a little
bit of bad weed?

Should we, maybe,
call in the National Police?

Are you high?

Yes, sir... I mean no, sir.
That would be bad idea.

(VOMITING, COUGHING)

Check every flight, hotel,
and taxi company. Find Pace.


(SIRENS WAILING)

ANNOUNCER: <i>Sick or ill prisoners</i>

<i>please report to the infirmary
immediately,</i>

<i>I repeat all sick

<i>Please report to

(SPEAKING ARABIC ON SPEAKER)

(BOMB BEEPS)

PACE: (WHISPERING) Okay.

WICK: (SIGHING)

Steady, hold it.
What?

Oh come on, man,
it's not an autopsy.



(INHALES DEEPLY)

(BOTTLE CLATTERS)

WHISPERS: Let's go.

My calculation... due south.
By my calculation...

Yep.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

Hammed Al-Zagreb, Office
of Poison and Noxious Gases.

Mm.

Who said anything
about noxious gases?

Nobody, yet.

See I have to test every patient
and the source of contamination.

Could be something
with simple explanation,

or something much,
much more serious.

As I said, will not be
able to determine that

until I properly
assess the situation.

We're going to need
a Hazmat cleanup immediately.

I... I don't...
Then, uh... (GRUNTS)

...you do not want it
to become international crisis.

No, no, no, no, no we don't.
W... what did you say you need?

Hazmat.
Hazmat, in Arabic, who died?

Not Arabic "hazmat."
Hazmat! Hazmat!

Ah, Hazmat. Okay, okay.

I understand, yes, okay.
How many you want?

You know what? I will handle.
Okay. Okay, okay.

(POP MUSIC CONTINUES)

(MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYING)


(MUSIC STOPS)
(MACHINE STOPS)

You serious?

With explosives?
I'm always serious.

How are we doing on time?

Running out of it.

How in the hell are we going to
get explosives down that tiny hole?

(GAS LEAKING)

We're building the Hindenburg.

(SPEAKING ARABIC ON SPEAKER)

Hi. I have been looking for you.
I need to show you something

this way, it's extremely
important and dangerous.

SCHULTZ: <i>So, where to?</i>

The El Amadi hospital,
emergency protocol, sir.

Right, so...
half of the prison population

are being taken
outside the prison?

At least half, yes, but the hospital
has cleared open a wing for us.

They'll be under 24-hour guard.
It's all under control, sir.

All right. Sounds like Pace.

(GAS HISSING)

Come on Wick. <i>Allez, allez.</i>
Talk to me.

All right, that
should be enough.

Good.
Lighter.

Time?

PACE: Five seconds.

Four.
In that case...

PACE: Three, two, one. Come on.
...make Daddy proud.

Whoa.



Yeah, according to authorities,
and all standardized tests.

GUARD: There was a car bomb, sir!
Car bomb, my ass.

Whoop! Damn!

Wow!


Pace.
What?

Okay. Do your thing.

I got you. (EXHALES)
I just get excited.

(SIREN WAILING)

PACE: Okay, take a picture.
Looking great.

PACE: Come on.

Beautiful.
PACE: Takes my breath away.

(CAMERA CLICKING)
Smile.

That's a beautiful picture.

Not ready?
Hold on.

(EXHALES)
PACE: Come on, tick-tock, tick-tock.

(ALARM BUZZING)

Show me the vault.
GUARD: One moment, sir.

come on, come on. Got it!

There, sir.

Looks all right to me.
GUARD: It looks good, sir.

PACE: All right. (EXHALES)

Right.

Hang on a second, zoom in.
GUARD: Let me see.


It seems frozen, sir.

All right.

Oh, bollocks.

Total lockdown.

Sir, we can't,
we possibly can't.

ANNOUNCER: <i>The prison is now
under lockdown.</i>

<i>I repeat, the prison
is now under lockdown...</i>

It's in the gurneys.

PACE: <i>Allez, allez.</i> Oop!

(SIRENS WAILING)

You have to stop those ambulances.
You have to step back.

(PHONE RINGING)

Good news or bad news?

Is Pace's daughter
good enough for you, Schultz?

Oh.

Lovely.
Keep her alive for an hour.

Thanks.

(SIRENS WAILING)

(TIRES SCREECHES)

MAN 1: Go, go, go!

MAN 2: Check everything
in the ambulance. Find the gold.

MAN 1: Follow me.

Clear.

MAN 2: Nothing in here.

MAN 3: Please don't shoot!

MAN 1: <i>We didn't find
anything, sir.</i>

Oi.

And you are?

Hazardous waste cleanup.
What hazardous waste?

Look man, we're just
trying to do our job.

If you have any issues
talk to our boss.

Eh, where's your boss?

Yeah, that's a crazy thing.
We have all this work to do

and they're stacking up crates?
Pretty heavy, too.

There they go.

MAN: Sir, we just got word,
Abu Hirawa has arrived for his gold.

Oh, don't worry about this. We won't
lose them. We've got men on every road.

Thanks for the thought of that,
but what have we got off road?

Sir?

You know what?

I like see what
you 'bout to do.

Mm-hm. Safety first.

RINGO: Be driving this thing,
Prince, aight?

Ay, look, okay, I get it.
You drive, you control the music.

I'm with that,
but we gotta do something

about the two double
Darth Haters back there.

Just... (MIMICS BREATHING)
I can't take it.

Jus' (MIMICS BREATHING)
I need music, come on.


(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah.

That's your shit, right?

RINGO: Yeah!

Do that shit! Yeah!
Let's go baby!

Yeah, baby.

(TIRES SCREECH)

RINGO: Whoa! Shit!

SCHULTZ: Go, go, go, go!

Woo!

This ain't the road.
I'm wit' it though.

Oh shit, let's do it!

SCHULTZ: Ah, our reinforcements.

Hello, friends!

(ENGINE REVVING)

Now it's a party,
turn that shit up! Whoo!

Woo-hoo (LAUGHS)

You like that wild shit.
Let's go!

RINGO: I'm not scared.
I ain't scared at all.

Brakes!

RINGO: Whoa!

Oh, shi...

Oh! (LAUGHS)

Y'all all right back there?

We good. We good?

Woo. Let's go. Come on,

Golden showers, baby!

You don't even know what that means.
You're nasty, man. Golden showers.

(SQUEAKS)
Go, go!

Hello.
(CAMERA CLICKING)

RINGO: <i>So here's where we're at.
None of us were armed.</i>

<i>We wanted Schultz to think
he had the upper hand.</i>

<i>Plus we ain't want
to get shot at.</i>

Hello.

(CAR STOPS)

RINGO: <i>It's about now that Schultz
realized he didn't really catch us.</i>

Fabulous.

RINGO: <i>Hold up, pay attention
to those white cars.</i>

<i>How would anyone know
where we were gonna be</i>

<i>before the chase even began?</i>

<i>It's called an anonymous tip.</i>

<i>We wanted to get caught
because we had a story to tell.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

So, it's still in the prison,
then?

Not exactly.

Stop. What are you moving?

We got a, uh, we got
a repair order right here.

Here you go.

Right there.

Still going to have
to take a look at it.

You betcha. Here you go.

Look at that.

See?

Dingdong.(KNOCKS)

I heard some
inmate damaged it.

Oh, yeah.
Crazy bastard.

Crazy...
(LAUGHS) The bullocks, huh?

Mutt's nuts. Okay, have a good day.
Yeah, yeah.

SOLDIER: Put the gun down!

RINGO: <i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

<i>Who the hell are these dudes
and where did they come from?</i>

<i>Check it, Prince told us
he'd have his soldiers</i>

<i>just hiding and waiting for
Schultz to brandish a weapon.</i>

<i>And then these guys rolled up
dressed like extras</i>

<i>in a bad
Salvadorian action movie.</i>

<i>No way in hell
these are real soldiers.</i>

<i>But I played along.</i>

You can't be brandishing a weapon
around a foreign military aircraft,

especially from
a sovereign nation of, uh...

Salwa.
Salwa.

Your country.
My country.

Just... just... just a sec,
just a sec.

Get it done, yes.

Looks like your daddy dearest didn't
come through for you today, ho'.

Finish her off.

Reservation's

VIOLET: I've been waiting
for that call.




(SHOUTING)
(THUD)


(GRUNTING)
Fucking men.

Well, that's that then.

We haven't been introduced.
I'm Hope.

RINGO: <i>That punch was the least painful
thing that happened to Schultz that day.</i>

<i>Inside of one of those
white cars I pointed out?</i>

<i>Was Abu Hirawa.</i>

(PANTS, COUGHS) Not my fault.

(PANTS)
It's okay. I believe you.

But there are those who are
not interested in the truth...

Only in justice.
It won't come swiftly.

RINGO: <i>The next day, some
talking head reported</i>

<i>the food poisoning
at the prison.</i>

<i>There was no mention
of any gold.</i>

<i>Like I said,</i>

<i>you're gonna rob a bank
make sure it ain't reported.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)
<i>â™ª I can see it in your eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That you wanna fight it

<i>â™ª I know boy you like it
Cash it cash it yeah cash it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So what you gonna do
So what you gonna do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cash it cash it Just say yes
Or no we want to â™ª</i>

Leave any of them alive?

Of course not.
RINGO: Good.

Where's my dad?
Sh... I don't know, he had to drive the truck here.

Oh, no.
Oh, no what? We got it. This is good news.

No.
He's around here somewhere.

No.

I have a terrible
feeling he's not.

WICK: Oh, my God.

VIOLET: It's the original.

Where's the gold?
He took it.

And he's not coming back.

No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, this can't be.

No, it can be,
it can so easily be.

Shit, I am so, so sorry.
I'm the one who vouched for him.

I brought him into
this whole thing.

After a lifetime of disappointment,
I should have known better...

Far better.


(FREIGHT DOOR OPENING)

Dad?

Yes.

You stole the gold.

I did.

From us?

Yep.

Then what the hell
you still doing here?

Hopefully... fixing things.

I cleaned it up a little.

Oh.


I love you.
I love you, too.

Uh, guys...

ALL: Shh...

What are you shushing me,
we got stuff to do.

You know what, this is
cute moment and everything

but we got a whole Sal,
big Sal... Sal-wa?

Salwan.

Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

Well, let's get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

My man.
PACE: Yes.

RINGO: <i>So, we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge</i>

<i>on Prince's country's
cargo plane.</i>

<i>Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe</i>

<i>he was actually a prince.</i>

<i>I said almost.</i>

Yo Ringo! Got your drink.
Hey!

Prince, for you.
Thank you.

Hey, you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

I want an umbrella,
what type of shit is this?

This is the life. I mean,
this is always my life.

Man, I can't believe
you're actually a prince.

I mean, in the animal world,

your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

Mm. A little training,
some skintight leather,

I could see myself
being a Misfit.

Don't even think about it.

I'd like to start by
getting to know you again...

in my retirement.

Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

Yeah, Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

No, actually, I think...

I think I fit in just fine.


Cheers.
Cheers.

Cheers guys. Bottoms up.
ALL: Cheers.
