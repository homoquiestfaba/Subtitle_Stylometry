Domesticated fowl.

It's a fuckin' chicken.

You remember that old
joke about the chicken crossing

the road?

Well, there's at least one

version where it doesn't end
too good for the chicken.

I don't know about you, but I

don't see anything funny about
dead animals.

When I was a boy, I always
wondered if dead animals went

to heaven, but my foster mother

told me animals don't got souls.

Well, I tend to disagree.

The saddest part of the job are the pets...

It just tears my heart out to
see 'em that way.

If things were up to me, I'd
give every one of these little

guys a proper burial to help
'em move on to a better place.

The county don't see it that way.

Paper or plastic?

Well, Bucky, it sounds like you
got a problem.

I didn't say that.

Well, what did you say?

Well, it was like I told you,
you know, Becky does want a

family and all, but I want the same thing.

I'm not sure I'm ready to be
a father yet, that's all.

And heck, I grew up without a daddy.

Well, have you told Becky how you feel?

Bucky, have you?

No!

Damn it, Bucky, the last
thing you need is some little

brat running around your house.

You're still a damn kid yourself.

You should've never gotten
married in the first damn place.

But I love her.

But that ain't no reason to get married.

That's six pounds, two ounces.

Now, if she wants to get
pregnant, how the hell do you

plan on stoppin' her?

I've done the research and

uh...

Kind of developed a technique.

Excuse me?

Technique... it's kind of like
a system that I worked out.

O.K.

They say that sperm cells
can't live long under adverse

conditions.

Go on.

I just created my own adverse conditions.

What the hell are you talkin' about?

As little as a 10-degree rise
in body temperature will kill

off most of your sperm cells.

So what are you doing, Bucky,

microwaving your nuts every night?

Hand warmers.

Put two of 'em in my underwear every day.

That's gotta lower my sperm count.

Damn, Bucky, I think you done
lowered your brain cell count.

It seems to be working.

How can you tell?

Well, she ain't pregnant yet, we uh...

Pretty much do it all the time.

How much?

How much, Bucky?

Oh, well, yeah.

Six pounds, two ounces.

Yes!

Come in cr-one.

Come in CR-1.

Here, Bucky, I'll get that.

Go for Earl.

Hey, Earl.

Paul wants you boys to meet him
over on highway six near the

county line.

Now?

Damn straight, and don't be late.

10-4.

Shit.

Hey, Paul, is the county paying
us to leave critters in the road

now?

Gentlemen, here's the situation.

Now, uh, America has more than
four million miles of roads and

highways and they're all
littered with road kill.

Modern day wildlife management,
critter control by family

vehicle.

And for every dead carcass you
find beside the road, you know

that there's 10 more you can't
see off in the bushes somewhere

and it's getting out of hand.

I don't get it, Paul.

What's this all about?

Well, what it's about, Bucky,
is the world is changing and we

got to change with it.

Now what you boys are about to
witness is a mechanical marvel

of carcass removal technology.

Gentlemen, let me introduce you
to the new CRT-3000.

It's powered by a 10-cylinder
turbo diesel, stacked with a

two-cycle afterburner and

muffled exhaust that generates
an environmental friendly

S.P.L. of less than 25...

[voice fades, becoming

Bucky!

Now wait just a goddamn minute!

There ain't but one son of a
bitch in that thing.

Well, I know, that's
the beauty of the thing...

Or not.

That's what I wanted to talk to
you boys about.

See, uh, if the committee goes
with this plan we got no choice.

We cannot justify two salaries.

We just can't do it.

That's a crock of shit, Paul.

Did I mention the internal incinerator?

Well, anyway, boys, that's the

way it's got to be and it's
really out of my hands.

I'm sorry.

Hey!

First it was those goddamn
biodegradable bags and it's shit

if we don't go computerized, and
we put up with all that crap so

you can just go ahead and can our asses?

Not "asses" as in plural, Earl.

"Ass" as in one.

Well, that's bullshit, Paul.

O.K., look, now if you want
me to say who's staying and

who's going, I'll do it.

I thought maybe you'd want to

figure it out amongst yourselves.

The job is yours.

Don't even give it a second thought.

I can't just take the job from Earl.

He's the one who got me the job
in the first place.

I owe him.

Your owe your family more.

Or do I need to remind you,
we're in the family

manufacturing business.

We're gonna need some elbow room
once the little one shows up.

I mean, if you're out of a job,
we ain't never gonna get that

double-wide you promised me.

Not to mention a new dress for
the talent competition.

It's gonna be so fantastic, me
up there just a-singin'...

You know, I was thinking of
getting a blue dress, you know,

kind of low-cut and sexy.

I mean, just a little bit...

Sex does sell.

And no use

concealing what the good lord gave me.

'Cause remember last year...

Bucky... Honey?

Yeah.

I don't know what my
temperature has to do with

making babies, but let's just go

make sure.

O.K., I'll be right there.

You know what?

I've been thinking about new trucks.

Is that right?

Yeah.

The way I see it...

You were never much to liking
this job anyway, were ya?

It seems as how Becky and I
got... You know, family plans

and all...

I was thinkin' maybe I ought to

take the county job.

Seems like the right thing.

Is that so?

Give it a crank.

Jimmy!

Jimmy!

â™ª I'd love to

â™ª have a woman like the one you â™ª

â™ª have...

Eddie, where's Jimmy at?

I don't know.

He ain't under here, I can tell
you that much.

Well, if you see him you tell
him to get his skinny little

butt in there and clean up that

mess he made in the living room. Jimmy!

How much longer are you gonna be?

Bingo's at six.

You ain't goin' anywhere

unless I get this damn fuel pump fixed.

Well, I see how you see

it, and I know, man, you want
to start a family.

That is if you ain't already
burned your nuts off.

But you gettin' the job would be
the right thing.

But your old buddy here has been
looking after you way too long

to see you do that to yourself.

Do what to myself?

You got to confront your problems, Bucky.

You want the easy way out.

You want the job just handed to you.

Well, life don't work that way, man.

Besides, man, if I just handed
you the job, what would you

learn from that, huh?

What would you learn from that?

It's a job, not learning.

Man, a job comes, a job goes.

But life's lessons...

Shit!

Jimmy!

What the heck happened here, Ches?

Figure old Ed, he busted the fuel line...

Looks like it sparked off something.

Funny old world, huh?

Well, the work's over here.

Oh, is that Roscoe?

It's all right, Jimmy, you're
gonna be O.K., son.

Sometimes... The good lord, he taketh away.

Looks like he took ol' Roscoe
away with a vengeance.

You get started, all right?

I'll be right back.

Hey, Lizzy.

You O.K.?

I'm sorry about Eddie.

It's going to be O.K.

You want to hustle it up here, Click?

Don't you see what this poor
kid's going through?

Look at that.

Hasn't been a widow woman an
hour and he's already sniffin'

out the territory.

Swear to God.

What's gotten into you?

She's a woman in need,

Bucky, I was there to comfort her.

She's a married woman.

Was a married woman.

Earl, what if that little boy

walked in and caught you
"comforting" her, huh?

Drive, Bucky.

It ain't right, you gotta know that.

Goddamn, look at that.

What do you say let's give her a lift?

No, let's say we don't, huh?

Hey, there, where you headed?

Someplace called Walker Pass Road?

What a coincidence.

We're headed that way too.

No, we're not, we gotta get
back to the pit.

Take it easy, Bucky, that pit
ain't goin' nowhere.

Hey, don't worry, we work for the county.

My name's Earl.

This is my partner.

We call him hot pants.

Hi, hot pants.

I'm Tess.

Well, we can take you down to
Broke Sky Bridge, but we gotta

get back, we're on a tight schedule here.

Here, let me get that for you.

Thanks.

Come on.

I swear to God.

Careful.

So, uh, walker pass road
seems a bit out of the way.

What you got waitin' for you out
there, your boyfriend?

No?

Your girlfriend?

My grandmother.

Are you Bernice's granddaughter?

Apparently so.

Well, you don't seem too sure.

'Cause I never met her.

I mean, I basically bounced
around foster home to foster

home my whole life.

Never really had a family.

So, here I am.

What the hell is this?

Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

What else you got here?

Knock it off!

I know you didn't want me in
your truck, but I mean,

sometimes it's a little scary
being on the road alone.

I really appreciate you giving me a ride.

Sure you're gonna be O.K.?

Yeah, I made it all the way
from Akron, didn't i?

Say, how about me and you
hook up a little bit later and,

uh, I could show you all the hot spots?

Yeah, show me all

the hot spots you passed out drunk.

Thanks, Mr. Earl, county worker.

Hey, you know, it's actually
not as late as I thought.

We could run you up there, we could.

No, that's O.K.

Thanks anyway.

Hey, if you change your
mind, I'm in the book!

Damn, Bucky, I don't know why
you waste the Good Lord's time

asking him to bless a dick's
full of rotten meat and bones.

They're god's creatures.

They deserve a proper burial...

Not just thrown out in some

garbage out in the middle of nowhere.

Well, if the county decides

on that mechanical marvel wonder
truck, all this is history.

And you can blame that goddamn Paul.

He thinks he's a damn genius.

He's the worst goddamn partner

I ever had.

He couldn't work worth of shit.

And now he's a supervisor.

78, not bad.

132?

Goddamn.

I think I figured it out.

Figured what out?

How to save our asses.

Now, we're gonna have to work
our nuts to the bone for a few

weeks, but we can do it, Bucky.

Now, listen up.

Now, the county's gonna vote on
that new truck in a few weeks,

so in the meantime, here's what

we do.

You wanna run that by me again?

Well, basically Earl wants to
make the Burr County mechanical

marvel look bad... So's our own
county supervisors will vote

against buying one for themselves.

And you're gonna do that

by stealing dead animals in the
middle of the night.

Yeah... From Burr County.

So...

We can input all that in the

computer logs and take credit for it.

Our numbers go up and their's

go down, so...

Why buy a new truck, right?

Well, that sounds nuts to me.

But, if you think it's that
important to try to keep you two

together, I guess it's worth a try.

When do you start?

I'm supposed to pick him up
at moose's at 11.

Tonight?

That's the plan, pickle.

Oh...

Bucky baby.

â™ª I gave to you some more familiar pain â™ª

â™ª You gave to me cruel tenderness â™ª

â™ª I brought you gold and silver
for your face â™ª

â™ª You taught me the hard way how to love â™ª

â™ª And if I ever get out of here alive â™ª

â™ª Don't call me baby, I'll call you â™ª

â™ª I'll get me all in step
for that mourning dove â™ª

â™ª Taught me the hard way how to love â™ª

â™ª Taught me the hard way how to love â™ª

â™ª I brought to you nice clothes
and honesty â™ª

â™ª So they might lead you to the truth â™ª

â™ª You gave me honesty behind your eyes â™ª

â™ª You taught me the hard way how to love â™ª

â™ª And if I ever get out of here alive â™ª

â™ª Don't call me, baby, I'll call you â™ª

â™ª I'll get me all in step
for that mourning dove â™ª

â™ª Taught me the hard way how to love â™ª

â™ª Taught me the hard way how to love... â™ª

Shit.

All right, we'll be right there.

What now?

Well water smellin' bad.

Possum might've fallen in there
and drowned or something.

We better go check it out.

Hold on, Bucky, hold on.

What's up?

Look, this is only about a

half a mile from the Burr County line.

Makes a lot more sense to check
this out tonight after we finish

our rounds.

Gonna put us there awful late, huh?

Dispatch says this guy is all
kind of impatient.

Well, that's all the better

reason to avoid the motherfucker.

Trust me, Bucky, this is better, man.

Take my word for it.

Well, are you gonna eat that or what?

Rufus, uh...

Well, this gotta be it,

Bucky, it's the only house out here.

Just pull in, man, let's get
this over with.

Come on, Bucky, get the top off

this thing.

Damn, something crawled up and died here.

God!

Yeah...

You got somethin'?

No.

Hold on, there's something there.

Oh!

Come on, Bucky, get the damn
thing out of there.

We don't want to be here all goddamn night.

All right.

Hang on.

There's something...

I see...

Ain't no possum, that's for sure.

It looks like it's weighed or something.

Something kind of heavy.

You want to give me a hand here?

Oh, God!

All right, Bucky.

You go to the truck and get that blue tarp.

I'm gonna get that thing out of there.

Bucky, are you listening to me?

We gotta go call Chester.

No, no, no, man.

You can forget that shit right now.

Earl, did you hook up with
her the other night?

What?

You think I had something to do with this?

I don't think anything's up.
We gotta go call the sheriff.

No, hold on, hold on, Bucky.

Goddamn it.

All right, O.K., I'll tell you,

I'll tell you the gospel truth.

We did hook up the other night.

But she was plenty alive when
she left my house the next

morning, Bucky.

Well, then we got a call to make!

It ain't that simple, Bucky.

My DNA's gonna be all over that.

They're gonna think I killed her.

Not if we tell 'em that you didn't.

Aw, man, with a record like mine?

Go get the fucking tarp!

Goddamn it, Earl, we gotta

tell somebody about this!

Bucky...

What, you want to see me fry for
something I didn't do?

Go get the tarp.

Move over, I'm driving.

Where are we takin' her?

Where do you think?

Oh, no, Earl, we're not taking her there.

Are you out of your mind?

It's not for people!

Exactly, Bucky, and nobody

ever goes out there but us.

This ain't right, Earl.

We shouldn't be mixing human
spirits with animal spirits.

It won't seem so bad come morning.

No, she deserves a proper burial.

Were things were different,

I'd say she'd have one.

But things ain't like that,

Bucky.

You understand me?

Now, after tonight, we never

tell nobody about this, do you hear me?

I mean nobody.

How'd it go?

It's all right, I guess.

How much longer do you think

you can keep this up?

I mean, you look beat.

You ain't never gonna get any decent sleep.

Here lies the body of

one of christ's beloved creatures.

Fine, decent man...

A leader of the community.

A loving husband and a dedicated father.

Now he is gone and we are here

to see that he receives a proper
Christian internment which is

his rightful due as a righteous
citizen of this community and an

active member of our parish.

Little Jimmy McClinton,
to step forward now.

I'm going to ask you to sprinkle

these rose petals on your father's grave...

A sign of love and a symbol of
a new beginning.

Let's all join in prayer.

Thus says the Lord God,

all my people, I will open your
graves and have you rise from

them and bring you back to the

land of Israel...

Thanks, Chester.

What is the matter with you?

Nothin'.

Bullshit, man, you're making a scene.

Now get a hold of yourself,

Bucky, the last thing we need...

Bucky?

Hey, Becky.

That was a beautiful service,

wasn't it?

Come on, Bucky, let's go home.

Hey...

You want to help me with this?

Help me with this?

Damn, Rufus.

Why don't you air this place out?

You are a venomous insect.

Get your ass up.

Get that thing on my knee
first, you stupid fuck.

I might hose you off first.

Get your ass up.

We better get to work.

Come on.

Yeah, I just gotta clean up

this mess real quick, thanks.

All right, hurry up.

O.K.

That looks like a 12-pack to me.

There's a leg missing.

Uh, it's in there, it's just

kind of twisted around.

Uh... Uh... Earl said that he
wants 15 apiece.

Next time.

So what he say?

I guess that means no.

All right, let's get the hell

out of here.

You're out of a job,

we ain't never gonna get that

double-wide you promised me.

Let's go, Bucky.

Man, he's got this big-ass box

of cereal, man, one of these

economy five-pound jobs, right?

So he's gonna haul it back to

the fuckin' store where he got

it, and he takes it in and goes

up to the counter and sees

the clerk, and the guy looks in

the box and he says, "well, how

do I know you didn't put them

pack of gnats in there

yourself?"

She wasn't but a kid, Earl.

I mean... Maybe we should've

never put her in that pit.

It's eatin' at me, man.

It's like it's crawlin' under
my skin or somethin'.

Well, what the fuck, do you

think I'm made out of wood?

I mean, what do you want me to

say, Bucky?

It's done.

It ain't right what we did,

Earl.

I just keep wondering what it

must be like for her out in

that pit.

Listen to me, Bucky.

Dead is dead, and that's all.

It don't make a rat's ass

difference if she's a chicken or

a goose.

It does too.

Goddamn it!

Do you want people to find out

that we put a dead girl in

that pit?

Shit.

What the fuck you think you

doing?

Are you trying to kill us both?

I'll show you all the

hot spots.

What's wrong?

You didn't finish.

You want to tell me what's

wrong?

I just didn't finish,

that's all.

You finding me less

attractive now that I'm talking

like a mother?

Oh, of course not, baby.

I'm just tired, that's all.

Earl's plan's wearing

you out.

Yeah.

And we're going again tonight.

It's all right.

We'll make up for it tomorrow

night.

After tonight, we never

tell nobody about this, you hear me?

I mean nobody.

Shit.

Hey, what are you doing

in there, sleeping?

No, just finishing up.

Well, I thought I'd bring you

your check out, save you all the

trip.

Thank you.

So, uh...

This new truck situation, you

guys given that any more

thought?

Well, Paul, I ain't heard

nothing from the county, and

until I do, I guess it's

business as usual.

Ain't that right, Bucky?

Jesus christ.

Looks like a big old damn

crockpot, doesn't it?

Well, see you boys later.

Bucky...

Bucky!

What's this?

Uh, it's something I got at

work.

It was on the side of the road.

Well, what are you planning

on doing with it?

I thought of giving it

to you.

What would I do with just one

earring?

Yeah, I don't know what I was

thinking, um...

You know, maybe I'll just give

it to Earl or somebody because

he's got all those kind of weird

girlfriends and stuff.

Forgive me father, for I have

sinned.

It's been two years...

2-1/2 years since my last

confession.

Father... Well, first of all,

I've used the lord's name in vain.

Yes.

And I also have been less
than honest with my loving wife.

Are you having an affair,

my son?

No, father.

I've just been less than

completely up-front with her

about everything.

Well, that's not good.

I just want to confess all

those sins and any other sins

that I may have forgotten about

up to this point.

Hmm.

And... And that's all.

That's it?

You know you can tell me, son,

that's what I'm here for.

Living with sin is like living

with the devil.

You don't want to live with the

devil now, do you, son?

No, father, I don't.

All right.

Say five hail Mary's and read

psalm 52.

In the name of the father, the

son and the holy spirit, amen.

Thanks be to God.

Father, would it be O.K. If I

asked you a question?

Shoot.

Well, if someone did

something and then someone else

did something else to protect

that person, then would it be a

sin to then go...

Damn flies.

I'm sorry, you were saying...?

It's nothing, all right?

Don't worry about it, it's

nothing.

You better make that 10

hail Mary's.

No, no, you keep it, Bucky.

What for?

I want you and Becky to go

down to George's tonight, get

you a couple of chicken fried

steaks and margaritas.

It's all right.

I'm serious, Bucky.

Look, I figure we'll take

tonight off and then we'll

hit it again tomorrow.

Come on, partner.

You could use a little break,

man.

Hello.

Hey, Becky.

Sounds like you had one too many

margaritas.

Earl?

Yeah, let me talk to Bucky.

I want to see if our boy finally

relaxed and had a little bit

of fun.

What are you talking about,

Earl?

He ain't even home yet.

I thought he was with you.

Uh... Yeah, he was but he

just left and said he was gonna

stop and pick up some margaritas

and food and shit.

Good night, Earl.

Get your ass out of bed!

Chester?

What are you doing out here, click?

Are you workin' that graveyard shift?

Graveyard?

Becky told me all about it,
you know, you're out here alone.

Where is old Earl?

What are you doing out here,

Chester?

I don't know.

Lannie called me and said

somebody ridin' around in
one of his pastures.

Really?

Yeah.

I'll probably give it a quick
look... It's an election year.

I'll see you later, click.

Did it go all right with you and Earl?

Yeah, yes.

I know what you did tonight.

I want to know what she looks like.

I bet she ain't nothin' but skin
and bones, right?

I know you would've never
met her if it weren't for

Earl Boggs.

Well, if this marriage means
anything to you, you will settle

this thing once and for all.

Tomorrow before you come home,

I want you to go to her and I
want you to tell her that it's

over, that it was a mistake, and
you can't ever see her again.

Honey, it's not what you think.

You best go sleep on the couch.

And in Ezekiel it says, "the
son shall not bear the iniquity

of the Father."

And what this is saying, my

friends, is that we are born

with a clean soul, a fresh light.

The sins of those that came
before us are not our burden.

We carve out our own destiny...

Live a life of goodness without

sin, as an example for those
that come after us.

So how was George's last night?

It was fine.

Did Becky enjoy herself?

She did, I guess.

You guess?

Well, hell, you should know,

Bucky, you were there, weren't you?

She had a great time.

And you're a goddamn liar.

I called your house last night about 11:00.

She tells me you ain't home from work yet.

So where were you, Bucky?

I just needed some time alone.

What, are you getting
a piece of ass on the side?

Oh, no, Earl.

Not everybody's like you, O.K.?

I just need some time by myself,
sort some of these things out.

Just what kind of things are
you sortin' out, Bucky?

Things like why you got us
coverin' up a murder here, Earl.

I mean, doggone it, Earl,
it's not too late.

We can still fix this.

We go down to the sheriff right
now we can...

Just stop it right there, Bucky.

We ain't goin' to nobody,
especially the sheriff.

I gotta know something, Earl.

Why are we protecting this old man, huh?

Why don't you tell me that?

We ain't protecting Rufus.

How do we know that he didn't

have something to do...

With Tess?

'cause I said so, that's why.

That ain't good enough, Earl.

I told you he didn't do nothin'.

Now drop it, Bucky.

What if I don't want to drop it?

He wouldn't have had nothin'
to do with that girl.

Maybe I ought to go over

there and talk to him myself right now.

You stay away from that place.

Well, then he certainly

wouldn't mind answering a few
questions, now, would he?

You don't go near him, you understand me?

You don't need to be steppin'
in that pile of shit.

You got to promise me
you won't go out there.

But Earl...

No, Bucky, you gotta promise

me, damn it.

O.K., all right, I promise.

Becky boo...

Pickle?

Hey, Bucky.

Hey, Chester.

Becky here?

Uh, no.

No, she ain't.

Good, come on, I'll show you

something.

Come on.

What do you think?

I don't like to brag, but...

I outdid myself on this one.

Could you just see her up there

on that stage, singing her heart

out, wearing this beauty?

You know how much it means

to her.

I was gonna surprise her

with it.

What time she gonna be home?

I don't know.

Becky, uh...

She left me, I think.

Well, hell, I'm sorry to hear

that.

Shoot, you know how much Elaine

and I think of y'all and

everything.

Hell...

This ain't got nothin' to do

with the little half-naked gal

I seen you and Earl with a while

back, does it?

Yeah, guess I'll...

Drop it off at her mother's

house.

See you later, click.

â™ª Don't need fortune

â™ª don't need fame

â™ª Don't need pity

â™ª or somebody else to blame

â™ª Don't need passion,

â™ª don't feel lust

â™ª I just need

â™ª somebody I can trust.

Oh!

O.K., Bucky, put it out of its misery.

Well, go on, do it.

It's in pain, for Christ's sakes, Bucky.

You're doing it a favor.

Hit the son of a bitch!

Put it out of its misery!

Hit the fucker!

God, Earl!

I can't do it.

You fuckin' pussy.

Give me that.

Die, goddamn it!

Don't you ever make me do your

job for you again.

You hear me?

Hello.

I guess congratulations

are in order.

The job's yours, uh, Bucky left

the truck out at the pit, the

keys are in the office.

I'll try and get you some, some

kind of temporary help, but that

won't happen till Monday, so you

might have to hit the road on

your own tomorrow, O.K.?

We gotta talk.

The job's yours.

No, it ain't about the damn

job, Bucky.

Goddamn it!

I ain't gonna let you just walk

away from this mess we're in.

It don't work that way.

Now, I know it's been hard

on you, man.

That girl in that pit.

And even though I'll probably

live to regret it, I'm willing

to go with you, Bucky.

We'll pull her out of there and

give her the kind of burial you

see fit.

Are you listening to me, boy?

I'm listening.

Well, that's what you want,

ain't it?

A proper burial and all?

I do.

Well, all right, then.

Now, tonight everybody in town's

gonna be over watching that damn

talent show.

You meet me in front of Bob's

old place about 8:00, then we

head to the pit and take care of

business, O.K.?

It still leaves a killer out

there on the loose, don't it?

Just be there.

Who in the hell are you?

Bucky click.

County carcass removal.

Yeah...

I'll be damned.

Listen to me, liz, goddamn

it, there ain't nothing fucking

wrong!

All right, all right, just

simmer down.

You don't have to yell at me.

I just want to see you.

I don't want to hear any more

excuses...

I am gettin' myself all dolled

up for you, so are we gettin'

together tonight or not?

Yeah, I got some shit I gotta do...

So when I finish that...

I'll be over and pick you up, all right?

You better.

Don't make me come lookin' for you.

All right. Bye.

Drink up, boy.

It's well water.

Ain't nothin' sweeter.

Might we be able to open up a
window, or two?

Oh, no, no...

Lets flies in.

Hideous, diseased... Creatures.

Vermin.

Yee-ha!

My partner and i, we two came

by the other night to...

Clean out your well.

I was kind of wondering, how

come you called us and not the sheriff.

You have no idea how much

I wanted to.

Ah, the trouble with him,

it's always in his secrets.

Never face the facts,
always denying the truth.

Kept secrets from me.

Kept secrets from you.

You like that, boy?

You like keeping secrets?

No, sir, but who...?

To deny the truth is to deny who you are.

That's what it says in the bible.

Yes, sir.

I always told him, never keep
from doing what you know is

right, and hell with
what anyone else thinks.

But he just didn't see it

that way... Nah.

Sir, who is "he"?

My son.

Earl.

Where the fuck are you,

Bucky?

It is unbelievable what
he can do with a rope.

Katch, come on up here.

You don't know much about

Earl Boggs, do you?

You see, I needed to raise a boy
to some day be a man.

A man's man.

A man...

Who had a clean soul.

I almost succeeded with...

Earl, but...

He had too many outside influences.

Mostly tramps and whores...

Sometimes I think Earl was just jealous.

He had no idea what I needed.

More importantly, he had
no idea what you needed.

Huh, what he knew

what I needed?

Get!

Help me!

Don't leave me like this.

Help me, help me.

You listen to me, boy.

You listen good.

Earl lied to you.

Earl was a child...

He had all this hatred runnin'

through his arteries.

It was my duty to cleanse his soul.

It wasn't easy.

Didn't take to it at first,

and then he saw the path, he
realized it was good for him.

Then you came into the picture.

You distracted him.

Earl, we gotta talk.

We need to talk now, O.K.?

So talk, Bucky.

I spoke with Rufus today.

I told you never go out there.

I had to Earl, I had to

find out...

What the fuck did he

tell you?

It doesn't matter, O.K.?

What matters is the two of us

going down to sheriff and

straighten things out 'cause I

can't live with what I done.

I can't!

Look, I done a lot of

fucked up things in my life.

I am a fuck-up, but I never

killed nobody!

Goddamn it!

My business is my business!

I told you stay away from Rufus!

I understand, Earl, but I

just want my life back, like

the way it was before we found

that girl.

But you're flat-out wrong asking

a man to throw away everything...

His wife, his home... for, for

whatever it is you're hiding.

Now, I'll come by first thing in

the morning, Earl, and we'll go

set things straight with the

sheriff together.

Please, we gotta do this.

May I introduce to you,

Becky click!

Here we go,

Becky, here we go!

Whoo-hoo!

Um...

â™ª The call of my heart
is callin' me home â™ª

â™ª He's takin' my hand and leadin' me back â™ª

â™ª where I belong

â™ª It's been too long

â™ª that I been gone

â™ª Gotta make a new start

â™ª 'cause the call of my heart â™ª

â™ª is callin' me home

â™ª Just when I thought I had it â™ª

â™ª together I felt a change

â™ª in the weather

â™ª And it gave me the blues

â™ª I thought of all the holidays â™ª

â™ª and the good times

â™ª that we shared

â™ª And if I must say,

â™ª it made me wanna be with you

â™ª It's been too long [too long] â™ª

â™ª that I've been gone

â™ª [i've been gone]

â™ª Gotta make a new start

â™ª 'cause the call of my heart

â™ª is callin' me home

â™ª I gotta make a new start

â™ª 'cause the call of my heart

â™ª is callin' me home.

Oh, God, if you hadn't come I

could have never done it.

I ain't never sung in front of a

crowd this big before.

I mean, you know, in church, but

that's different.

Oh, honey, you don't know what

this means to me.

Becky, please, I gotta tell

you something real important,

all right?

You're not gonna believe this.

Earl and me...

You really don't think

he'll go with you?

No, I don't.

Something ain't right with him.

I don't know what it is, O.K.?

He's changed.

Well, maybe I should talk

to him.

[vehicle approaches,

â™ª How do you like me now? â™ª

You promise me you stay away

from him.

I promise.

What do you want from me...?

So let the water and

the blood cleanse...

[Rufus continues praying,

Earl... Earl!

Are you there?

Pick up, Earl!

No... No.

Becky?

Becky?

Becky?

Earl?

Hello, Rufus?

Earl?

Hello?

Don't go in there.

Where's Becky?

I said don't go in there.

I finally did what I should've

done a long time ago.

I've been here before.

Why was I here?

Your mama.

She asked me to look after you

for a couple of days.

You knew my mama?

You never told me.

I told her I'd take good care

of you.

It wasn't long before I was

passed out, drunk.

When I woke up, I heard Rufus

in there, prayin'.

And I knew that goddamn prayer

by heart.

I about begged him to open the

door.

I begged him, but he just kept

praying.

Let the water, the

blood, cleanse you...

I could hear you in there,

Bucky, you were just, you were

just splashin' around, you was

laughin' like nothin' was wrong.

And then it got real quiet.

Then you...

Then you started screamin'.

I tried to break the goddamn

door, Bucky.

[thudding on door,

I tried to kick the goddamn

door in!

It was too late, man.

It was my fault, it was my

fault.

I let her down, I let your

mama down, I let you down.

It was my fault.

My mama knew what happened

to me?

She never saw you again.

You promised me you wouldn't go

out there, Bucky!

Why'd you go out there?

Get on out.

Get on down.

What are you doin', Earl?

I'm doin' what I'm supposed

to be doin'.

I'm takin' care of Bucky click.

Earl, how come you never told

me about what Rufus done and

all that?

Because you ain't got the

goddamn constitution to handle

something like that.

How come you didn't ever do

something?

You know, report him, or...

It ain't that goddamn easy.

We talkin' about family.

I spent my whole goddamn

childhood runnin' and hidin'

from Rufus, just hopin' he'd be

too drunk to find me.

And some days I was lucky,

and other days he got what he

wanted.

You should've never gone up

there, you promised me you

wouldn't go.

And now that you know the truth,

there ain't no goddamn way I'm

gonna let you live your life

with the same kind of pain that

I live mine.

So turn around.

Earl, you can't do this.

I said turn around, Bucky.

I should've never left you alone

with him, buck.

I'm sorry, Bucky, you gotta

believe me.

I do believe you, Earl.

I just want things back the way

it used to be.

You know, me drivin', you

ridin', the two of us takin'

care of business.

I know, Bucky, I know.

But it can't be that way.

It's over.

Don't look at me!

Here, put this over your head.

Put it over your head!

See, I promised your mama that

I'd take care of you, and I

can't let her down again like I

did that day.

Earl?

Yeah.

I gotta know something.

Are you my father?

I hoped I'd never cut out to

be no daddy.

Earl?

Oh, Earl!

God, no, Earl!

Oh, no!

Earl...

I don't know how long it was

before I finally called the

sheriff... And I explained to
him as best I could about

everything, even Tess, like I
should've done a long time ago.

At least now she'll get a
proper burial and be at peace.

There's a lot of things I

didn't know about Earl, but
deep down I know he didn't kill

that poor girl.

With a new job, Becky got just
about all she ever wanted,

except for one thing.

So we decided to petition the

county and give a home to
little Jimmy McClinton.

At least this way his childhood

will be better than mine.

You know, Earl always said,

"dead is dead."

But I know now that's not true.

Some days I can feel him with

me, just like it used to be...

Me drivin', Earl ridin'...

Takin' care of business.

And even though it can't ever
be that way again, I'm sure

everything will be just right.

â™ª Whatever may come my way â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Tomorrow is another day, I'll be fine â™ª

â™ª Life is short, life is hard â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Every breath's a brand-new start â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

With chorus: â™ª I'll work my
fingers to the bone â™ª

â™ª My pockets held all that I own â™ª

â™ª I fell asleep where I lay down â™ª

â™ª A thousand welcomes I've worn out â™ª

â™ª I've learned enough that I can say â™ª

â™ª Hey, hey, whatever may come my way â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Tomorrow is another day, I'll be fine â™ª

â™ª I've lost at love, I'll try again â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª I don't know where, I don't know when â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª I'm pullin' myself up off the mat â™ª

â™ª Lost my faith, got it back â™ª

â™ª I sat upon a mountaintop,
thank the lord for all I got â™ª

â™ª The simple things are everything I need â™ª

â™ª Hey, hey, whatever may come my way â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Tomorrow is another day, I'll be fine â™ª

â™ª This big old world one day will end â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª If those pearly gates will let me in â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Dancin' on those streets of gold â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Forever young is what I'm told â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª So whatever may come my way â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Tomorrow is another day

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Life is short and life is hard â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª Every breath's a brand-new start â™ª

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª I'll be fine

â™ª I'll be fine.
