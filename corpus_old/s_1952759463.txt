What is freedom?

Are we born free or do we earn it?

And if you deny freedom to the quiet ones,
those who have no voice,

can you be free yourself?

Or are you caged
by your own lack of compassion?

My name is Charlie Cranehill.
You’ll read about me in the news,

see pictures of me
with the word terrorist after my name.

They say freedom isn’t free.

Absolutely goddamn right.

We spend our lives saying no.

Not me. Not my fight.
Not my problem. Not tonight.

What’s the difference between you and me?

A few years ago I became someone
who said yes.

Me.
My fight. My problem. Tonight.

THREE YEARS AGO

Shit, I forgot to tell you Nicole called.
What? When?

When you were in the shower.

She’s got a new number.
I wrote it on the wall.

No, no, no, no, no. Don’t pick it up.
I have to.

Don’t pick it up!
It’s already picked up. Hi Dad.

Charlie? Where are you?
Riley’s.

Goddamn it, Charlie.

If you want to blow off the rest of your life
messing around with that girl, that’s fine.

I’m not blowing off my life!
But if I set up an appointment for you,
you goddamn well better be there.

Charlie, you should be on the highway right now.
I’ll be there!

That girl…
Her name’s Riley!

Where are you going?
Some job interview.

Some job?
Friend of his. It’s some business thing.

Okay, some business thing?
Holy fuck, are you serious? Can we just eat breakfast?

He makes you ugly, Charlie. He makes you mean.
This is me, Riley. If you don’t like it, I’ll leave.

That would be easy.
Why don’t you try doing something hard?

All your talk of  animal liberation,
and how it’s like the civil rights movement…

…or women’s suffrage… or slavery.
It is!

Okay.

Are you willing to break the law with me?

Nicole’s organized an action.
What kind of action?

Breaking into the University labs,
and liberating the animals… tonight.

Or, you can go to your interview
for some… business thing.

You again today. I’m gonna kick your ass again.

What the hell, Charlie?
I skipped the appointment.

Well, you certainly blew that one, didn’t ya’?

And Charlie? If you think I’m ever gonna
stick my neck out for you again..
I don’t.

I love you, Dad. But you need to let go.

I have never forced anything on you.

Yeah. Have a good night.

TWO YEARS AGO

It’s okay.

Got him?
Yeah, I got him.

WE WON’T STOP UNTIL YOU DO

This is my team.

The government would call them my cell.

But cells are cages.. and we are free.

Our mission is simple.

Liberate animals from places of abuse.

Inflict economic damage on those
who profit from their misery and exploitation.

Reveal those atrocities to the public.

Never harm anyone, human or nonhuman.

Follow these rules,
and you are a member of the Animal Liberation Front.

What’s up, Charlie?
How you doing?

Good, man. Good to see you.
Hey, babe! Charlie’s here!

Ok, so what do you got for me?
The red tape is footage from the liberation,

and the rest are recon from our guy on the inside.

Make sure they’re breathin’.

If you see that they’re stopped breathing,
start like givin’ ’em a whack.

You better wake up!

You got ‘em all?

Yes.
Good boy.

We’ll cut it together first thing in the morning
and get out the communiqué.

RIGHT NOW

Yes, Toni?
There are some people here to see you, with badges.

Badges?
Yes.

Really. Okay,

tell ‘em I’ll be there in just a moment.

Hello, Mr. Cranehill.

I’m Agent Tamar Burke. This is my partner, Eric Johnson.

We’re here about Charlie.

What about him? Is he okay?

Do you know where he is?

Sir, have you ever heard of the Bold Native?

Bold Native is an alias for a terrorist or terrorist group

responsible for a series of attacks
costing almost a million dollars.
Terrorist attacks?

Medical labs, farms, all animal related businesses.

It’s part of a loosely organized group called
the Animal Liberation Front, or the A.L.F.

This is a letter claiming responsibility
for the arson of a poultry farm in Ohio.

This is a letter from your son
to one of his friends.

Some of the expressions
match almost word for word.

This is a journal
that we believe to be Charlie’s.

And on this last page it shows
a farm that was hit by arson.

Here’s a photograph
of your son with Jeff Breen.

Where the fuck is Jeff?
They nabbed him.

Wyatt, you said one guard on break from 12 to 12:10.
It was always just one guard. Come on!

I think he’s gonna talk.

Jeff Breen connected a lot of dots for us.

He does hate your guts, Charlie.
What did I do?

You were with Charlie, weren’t you?
Yeah, he was skullfucking me like Indiana Jones.

You shoulda been there, Jeff.
I’m kidding, I’m obviously fucking around.

I just want you to answer the question, Sonja.
Jeff, Charlie’s my best friend.

He’s been my best friend since we were like 12 years old.
You know this.

Well that’s great.
You’ve known this since we started dating.
I don’t even know why it’s a big deal.

Well, where were you guys?

Can you keep a secret?

You have to run.
Wyatt, pull over.

What the fuck?
Pull the car over, Wyatt.

What am I supposed to do without you?

You’ll be fine.

Dream on, Castaneda!
My head’s gonna go all Chernobyl, I swear!

Hey! You brought him in!

I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Jellybean!
It’s not your fault.

Yes it is. I’m miss bad idea.

I love you. I believe in you. Okay?
I will be back.

Bold Native has been quiet for almost two years.

It’s been four years or five since
you last heard from Charlie?

I can’t answer any more of your questions
without an attorney present,

so if you would like to make an appointment..
We’d like to have a look around.

I don’t think that’s possible.

Mr. Cranehill, search warrant.

Thank you.

I’ll start with the back.

DAD, I KNOW YOU’RE WORRIED AND HAVING ME FOLLOWED.
I HAVE TO DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE. I’M FINE. PROMISE. C.

Shit!

Nice guitar. It’s a little dusty, but...

You know, you, you can take whatever you want.

I want to know what kind of research you did
for the Happy Chickens ad campaign.

What?

Happy Chickens.
Oh.

You are the Karl Hansen that designed that campaign
for the egg industry?

Our, our client was the state ag Board.
Same thing.

You know, I’m..
I’m, I’m sorry, I think..

Whoo! Feelin a little drunk.
Wanna sit down?

Yeah, yeah.

Oomph! Okay!
I just wanna talk.

Okay.
Okay.

Alright. Okay. I’m gonna.. I cooperate here.
Let’s sit, have a chat. Sit on your hands.

What?
Sit on your hands.

Okay? Comfortable?

You’re an animal rights person.
We’re all animal rights people.

Just depends on what your definition of animal is.

For instance, I think that you have a right
to get married, unlike your parents.

What do you know about my parents?
I know more than Bob does.

Like the fact that they’re still alive.

You are very interesting, Karl.
I am?

You are.

How do you breathe, living in such a cage?

I don’t know what you are talking about.

Are you an ex-gay in recovery?

Conversion therapy for
unwanted same-gender attraction?

God, that must have sucked.
It was fine.

No. That’s not fine.
You got out, you said thanks Mom and Dad for saving me...

It made them happy. It didn’t hurt anyone.

Both you and I know your boyfriend
wouldn’t stand for that bullshit.

It was just easier to tell him
that they were dead.

Hiding mail, watching the phone, lies about business trips
when you’re just going to go see your parents?

Almost as much work as carrying on an affair,
which you also happened to pull off.

Unfortunate it was with an intern.
Okay, what do you want?

I want the money that you were paid
for that Happy Chickens bullshit.

Eighty-two thousand,
six hundred and fifty-two dollars.

You can use that computer to transfer the money
through a network we’ve set up.

I’m a vegetarian, you know.
I do know that. Why is that?

I like animals. I don’t wanna eat them.

You eat eggs?
Free-range organic.

You know they kill all the male chicks?

Even with free-range hens.

They’re too skinny to eat because they’re different
than genetically modified birds we call “broilers.” 

The males are useless, so we feed them through a chipper,
still chirping for their moms.

I didn’t know that.

Most people would be upset by that.

Just like most people would be upset if they were forced
to see the way that chickens are treated in general.

That’s why Happy Chickens is a cartoon, not footage
like what we’re watching, which is reality and not very happy.

So what are you gonna do with the money,
if I give it to you?

We break in to places like that and liberate animals.

The money buys equipment.
It buys food for the animals we rescue.

They’re all sick. Most of them need medical attention
for the rest of their lives.

That couch cost three grand.

I was considering swallowing a bottle of Ativan
and lying down on it tonight.

Okay…

Right now, I really need you to tell me
that you believe that things can change.

Yeah I believe that things can change.

Okay. Then I’ll give you the money.
But only if you take me.

What the hell did you say to him?

It was more like what he said to me.

Listen, I think he’s sincere,
but he may just be drunk and I may just be hopeful.

Ah, romance.
I’m serious. He goes Judas,
it’s your ass down the rabbit hole.

My bad call on Jeff got you where you are,
so the worst case is we’re even.

But I trust you, all the way to the end.

This guy right here?
This guy.

Nice cows.

You got your earthquake kit there, pilgrim?

Terrorist attack kit, actually.

So Karl, you can call me Sonja.
Is that a code name?

Yeah, it was a toss-up between that and..
fuck you, what the hell are you doing here?

I like Sonja better.
Yeah, me too. For now.

We’re also encouraging you to begin frequent audits
of cattle slaughterhouses as practiced by McDonalds.

That should ensure
that the captive bolt gun usage is..

rendering the animal unconscious before slaughter.

We’d like to end our protests

and as I’m sure you’d like to see them end them
as well I’m hoping we can find some common ground.

Our first request is that you consider
matching Burger King’s commitments.

Which ones are those?
Requiring seventy-two square inches
per hen in battery cages.

Stopping forced molting.
Forced molting?

Withholding food and water
to speed the laying process.

Where are the numbers on the economic impact?
Page twenty-two.

We’re also looking at a gradual shift to cage free eggs.
Our research shows a shortfall in supply there.

Change takes time, so we’re looking at five percent
by the end of the year.

That should send a strong message to your customers
about your commitment to humane practices.

Hello, sorry I’m late.
Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders.

Phil.. Hi, I’m Jack Sanders
Jane Harreld.
Please, continue.

Phasing out gestation crates for breeding pigs,

beginning with a commitment to purchase 20 percent of pork
from gestation crate free producers by the end of this year.

I was raised in a farm. Did you know that?

I didn’t know that.
Yeah. Missouri.

Phil, did you know that?
Yes sir, I did.

Our last commitment is more symbolic.

A stated preference for poultry producers
who use controlled atmosphere killing.

The current practice of live shackling
and electric stunning reduces meat quality

and yield through routine broken bones,
bruising and hemorrhaging.

Controlled atmosphere killing allows the birds
to remain in their transport container,

where they’re exposed to non-poisonous gases
that cause anoxia,

and it’s also much easier on the slaughterhouse workers.
There are significant costs involved in switching over.

Actually, because of decreased contamination,
carcass downgrades, labor costs,
and other factors we’ve discussed,

most studies indicate an increase
in revenue over a period of a year.

There are details on page thirty-four
for your reference.

And, like I said, this is a purely
non-binding preference statement.

That’s the last issue, right?

We’re also encouraging you to begin frequent audits
of cattle slaughterhouses as practiced by McDonalds.

This would ensure that the captive bolt gun usage
is consistently rendering
the animal unconscious before slaughter.

Cows were my favorite animal when I was a boy.
Marvelous creatures.

Yes they are.

Ms. Harreld, you seem to be a very reasonable individual
and I appreciate the presentation,

but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.
It’s been an absolute pleasure to meet you.

Mr. Sanders, you have an opportunity here
to take additional steps that would put you
in the forefront of the industry,

and would ensure that we won’t be meeting again
in a year or two so that you can catch up.

Young lady, this company does not take its orders
from a protest group who wants to
turn our customers into vegetarians.

We are here to work with you.
But you’d much rather put us out of business, wouldn’t you?

I would much rather that if people are going to eat animals,
that those animals experience as little suffering as possible.

We can agree on that, can’t we?

That, Ms. Harreld, we can agree on.

Have a good day.
Have a safe trip, Mr. Sanders.

I want people who have had these kind of cases before,
people who know the system. Thanks Evan.

And Frank, I want the best. Fly them in here as soon as possible.
I don’t care what it costs, just get it done.

Charlie!

Come on!

Earthquake!

Come on, Sunshine. Get up.

What the fuck is that?
It was in my uh.. my kit. You know it’s like a..

For like..
Like an emergency thermal blanket thing. From the..

Really. Wow.
What? It’s warm.

It’s warm?

Ah, shit.

Wow.
What the fuck?

This is Karl’s blanket. This is Karl’s blanket.

So cozy.

What is alleged here by the government is
that your son engaged in arson, vandalism and theft, 

dealing with animal enterprises. That comes squarely
within the four corners of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.

The Animal… Enterprise… Terrorism… Act.
Okay.

The act targets animal activists. Ultimately, it wants to silence them
and to actually put them away for a long time.

They’ve taken property crimes and have labeled them
as terrorism as it relates to an animal enterprise.

Pharmaceutical industry,
the meat industry, they’re big business.

They banded together and asked for this legislation,
lobbied for this legislation, and they were very successful.

Legislators are not coming up with terrorism laws
for right wing extremists.

Anti-government, anti-abortion and white supremacist groups
who have either killed or injured people are not on the terrorism list.

These industries can get protection by convincing
the government that, you know, this is really domestic terrorism.

The penalties have increased exponentially.

Each different company could be a separate act of animal terrorism.

If you have four or five different companies,
your son could face life imprisonment.

Richard doesn’t know where his son is.
Should his son contact him, let’s say hypothetically..

Your phone conversations and everything you do
is probably being monitored right now.

It’s important to really look towards turning himself in.

You know, he can only run so long.
Eventually, they’re gonna find him.

Damn it!

Jesus Frank, I should have never stopped looking for him!

You have any idea where to find him?

He was living with a girl in Cedarville couple years ago.

Well, for what it’s worth,
I doubt they expect you to go looking for him.

I could drop you off on the other side of the lake,
they wouldn’t know about it until we got back.

What makes you think I can find him when they can’t?

I don’t. But I do know what you’re gonna go through
if something happens to him and you didn’t even try.

I mean, you wouldn’t be able to access any of your bank accounts,
call anybody you know,

not your office, not me, nobody.
You’d have to disappear there, Richard.

If I’m not on this boat when you pull in..
Why don’t you let me worry about that, alright?

You know, I don’t know if you remember, but, uh,
we lobbied for that Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.

If Charlie’s arrested as a terrorist,
they can pretty much do anything they want to him.

Richard, you deserve to see your son alive
and free again before you die.

Hey, not too short, Malik
I got you, I got you. No worries, man.

So you really, really want to go underground?
You should get rid of this emo cut.

And, uh.. check this out here. Click these on…
Woah, Malik! Malik!

You looking like my main man Tylin over there!
You see him right there?

That’s how you gonna look, just like my man T.
He is killing the game right now.

You need some game too, so…
I didn’t even really come in here for a haircut.

So if you didn’t come for a haircut then what’d you come for?

We’re trying to go national with this thing.
National.

Think you could handle this region?
I’m pretty well connected. I got a couple of people.

You trust them?
I trust those people about just as much as you trust him. Who’s he?

Who is he?
Who is that guy?

I’m.. I’m Karl.

Uh.. I need to rent some… some surfing stuff.

Wetsuit for sure.
Probably we’ll need a, uh… a towel too.

You know could I get that sticker too?
The shark one there.

There sharks out there? It’s a baby shark.
He’s mean though, look at that.

Have fun.

How’s it going, Professor Straithern?

Charlie Cranehill! As I live and breathe
I never thought I’d see you out here today.

I’ve been recovering.

Three years of recovery, huh? We weren’t that drunk, were we?
You know, I don’t remember.

Back for more education, Charlie?

I got a killer class this year.
The American Empire and the fall of D.C.

Always the optimist.

All that terrorist noise is nothing
but a profitable distraction.

The real war, Charlie, will be between the people
and the multinational corporations.

You mark my words.

Well, until then, you interested in a little frontline action?

Hi pups.

The professor on board?
He’s on board.

Nico.

So what’s the plan, what are we up to?
I’ve been waiting to show you my little shark contribution.

I’ve named him Karl, Jr.

That’s appropriate.
Thanks.

We’ve got a long road ahead of us.

Yo! What up, man?

I’m feeling really friendly right now.
Okay.

I’m feeling so…
Here’s another friend.

Okay. Hey, guy! How ya’ doing? Ah, he didn’t care.

Hey guys! What’s up? Have fun down there!

Oh god.

Keep it going girls!

Nice wheelie, man!
Whassup?

You know, people wanna be talked to.
People wanna be acknowledged, right?

Hey guys! Happy Friday!
Happy Friday!
Thank you!

Whenever you’re afraid to talk to somebody,
just remember, people want to be talked to.

What am I, a robot?

And that’s good in advertising, that’s good in business.
That’s everything.

Hello.
Howdy.

Um… beer.

We got blonde on tap.
Sure.

Hey, uh, Cedarville - that’s just up the road, right?
Eh… it’s a ways from here, but it’s north, yeah.

How far away is Cedarville?

It’s about three or four hours.

If I signed a contract with you, say for five thousand dollars,
would you drive me up there?

I brought a guy in once like you.

He’s the reason why Charlie was underground for two years.

He loved this cause, and he really… loved me, I think.

So…

it just doesn’t always work out.

Why are you here, Karl?

I’m here because I wanna be here.

You can face up to decades if you get caught.

You will be prosecuted as a terrorist, do you know that?

Karl, if you want to leave this, no one’s gonna blame you,

but you can’t do this for you.

You just can’t do it for you.

I’m taking the jump into the deep end.

Alright. Let’s see if you can swim.

I can swim. Did you know I was the most improved backstroke
when I was like ten years old?

I am fucking serious.
At the beginning of the summer I was slow as shit.

By the end of the summer I won like this little trophy,
like most improved backstroke.

I just have to put my mind to something.

When I put, when I put my energy in the right arena…
He just has to put his mind to animal liberation and it will happen.

I…
He’ll just put his mind to it.

It’s about will!

So, I heard you’re looking for a ride.

I am, yes.

Can you pay gas?

My name’s I-Rock, man. Nice to meet ’ya.

Iraq? Like the country?
No, not like the country.

In fact, the last time I looked, I was nothing like a country.

I have been I-Rock for years, like years
before any of that shit went down.

Rock steady. Rock hard. Rock out! I…rock!

I get it.

So what’s your name?
Richard.

This is Richard! We’re going on a road trip.

Hi! I’m Shrine.
I’m, uh, Richard.

That’s a self portrait done by my friend. He OD’ed when
he was twenty five, and that was painted after that.

That’s my son. That was the first time he painted from a model
when he was sixteen. Do you have kids?

Yeah I do.

So, uh, is she, like, packing a bag or something?
I dunno.

I-Rock? I-Rock!

No, I rock.

Where are you?

We’re taking this?
Almost ready.

Come on, let’s go.
What else do I need?

Ah! You need anything?
No!

Hey! Hey! What’re you doing?!
No! Just you wait! Ahhhhh!

Jesus Christ! You’re gonna get us arrested!

It’s an eye rock!

I hate this smell.

I think we’re starting to get into “get the fuck off my property” territory.

You ever seen a baby calf taken away from its mother?
No.

All these cows have had their children taken away
from them several times.

Usually within about 24 hours after birth.

Then they’re hooked up to machines twice a day for months,
and we suck out the milk that they were producing for their stolen children.

The boys become veal calves. The girls are raised in crates
until they’re ready to birth themselves. 

Then after six or seven years when they’re completely worn out
and broken from life as a milk machine they limp up a ramp

and are led to slaughter.

I drink organic milk.
That means they get organic feed,
but the process is still the same.

What do you think, Karl?
You getting any news ideas for Happy Animal campaigns?

Let’s go. Got some trouble to start.

Yeah we do!

Shit!
Double or nothing?

You playin’ me?
Just lucky, I guess.

Up to no good, I see.
Charlie Cranehill. You wanna play?

With you? I don’t think so.

But I got some action you might be into.
What kind of action we talking about?

How many actions?
Dozens.

On the same day?
That’s right.
Hell yeah!

Wait up!
Okay.

What the fuck was that, man?

I thought it was our best take,
so I did my little victory dance.

Yeah, well, your best take needs to be better, alright?
So we gotta do that all over again.

That sounded pretty good to me.
What do you do, again?

Advertising?

It sounded good to me too.
Charlie, am I gonna have to kick you guys out of here?

Nah, man I thought that sucked too. Let’s do that again, guys.

This time with some fuckin’ energy!

Daisy, you look like you’re stoned. I mean, seriously let’s just,
like, get our shit together here.

I thought you wanted to whip these guys into shape.
Um, I think I can handle it.

Actually, we’re hoping you can help us
handle some other unruly beasts.

So here’s the rules. You get to pick the tattoo,
I get to pick where it goes.

What kind of tattoo would you like?

Uh, how about an invisible one?
Karl! Hey! You gotta do this, we all did this.

I’ll be the guy that doesn’t have one.

Oh shit! Look at you!

Aw yeah, “man’s ruin.” That’d be sick!

I’m not familiar with this here.
What up?

What up, girl? What’s going on with you?
Chillin’.

You still drive that big rig?
Hell’s yeah.

You down to move some packages for us?
What’s the destination?

New homes.

If you see Buddha on the road, liberate him.

Is it time?

We’re in the now, baby.

I have an army of compassion awaiting orders.
How many homes are we manifesting?

A good many. If we can afford food and medicine.
Money man?

Wake up, doctor.

Oh. This better be good, Cranehill.

If by good you mean counting real sheep
instead of imaginary ones,

then yes, it’s good.

I assume we’re talking the usual?

Trauma, injuries, disease.

I’ll put a team together.

Stat!

Don’t say stat.

Diss!

I can’t do arson, Charlie.

Well it’s about the liberation.

Any damage you can cause the facilities
is helpful but not necessary.

I’ve got a big bottle of buteric acid.

Where can I get one of those outfits?

Commit your life to cheeriness.

Fuckin’ A! Sign me up!

You in?
In it to win it.

Who the fuck are you?
Oh, hey, how you doing?

Sorry, I didn’t mean to.. to disturb you or anything but..
What do you want?

Uh, does Riley live here?
Who the fuck is Riley?

I don’t know who Riley is.
Well I, uh, so Riley has never...

Who’s that?
Oh, she’s with me.

Uh, I was just wondering..
Tell her I said she’s hot. Please leave. Bye.

Did you look for clues?

Now what?

Sorry to bother you again.
Is there any way we could come in and just take a look around?

You got a warrant?
We’re not the police.

Then you can fuck off.

Oh! We’ll give you the antenna!

Did you find any mail when you moved in here?

Anything that might tell us about the previous occupant?
Some redneck fucktard wrote on the wall.

Alright, what would you do?

I’d tell her, I got her number from a friend,
I’m passing through town with a friend, and I need a place to crash.

To crash.
Yeah, say crash.

She’s gonna take one look at me and know that I don’t crash.
We’ll work on that.

What kind of joint is this that we’re going to?

This is an intentional..
she said it was an intentional community.

I guess they intend to live together
rather than accidentally living together.

Can I try these on?

What? Here’s a shirt.

It’ll work. It’ll totally work.

Get a sweater, jeans, and... a mustache.

She said, uh.. turn left at the second bridge.

You might want to hit the windshield wiper a couple of times.
Yes sir. Interminnet.

In a minute?
Interminnet!

Interminnet.

There, see.
There’s the second bridge, right there, right there.

Bridge number two.
Right there!

Okay!
Don’t kill this bike.

Trespassers will be violated?
Huh.

Okay.

Hi. I’m Nicole. You must be Richard.
I am. This is I-Rock.

Like the country?
No, like… she rocks.

Got it. Hey, we’ve got a window of opportunity
before the rains come back.

We could use some help with the sandbags.
Yeah!
Great.

You two together?

I-Rock? No. No, we just met.

Where you headed?

I’m looking for my son, Charlie Cranehill.

You know him?
I don’t think so.

Your phone number was on the wall
of Riley’s old apartment.

I remember Riley.

My son is in trouble.. with the FBI.

Don’t worry about it, they don’t know where I am.
I just need to talk to him before anybody gets hurt.

So what happens when I tell you
to get the hell out of here?

Well, I guess I just call the FBI and tell them to come and talk to you.
You’re not gonna get what you want by force, Richard.

He’s my son.
Yes.

What is it that I’m supposed to do?
You’re supposed to love him for who he is.

Love him for who he is.

I do love him.

I don’t want to go to jail, Charlie.
Me either.

You’re not having coffee with the FBI’s most wanted.
Want me to scram?

I see you brought your shadow along for the ride.
The Shadow knows, Peter.

Operation Free Range.

Simultaneous attacks on
factory farms all across the country.

Can you give us a minute?
He’s cool.

Have you forgotten everything about security culture?
We said you could trust him.

I heard that’s what you said about Jeff.
Fuck you, man.

I don’t know who Jeff is, but.. I’m not a Jeff.

Factory farms, infrastructure, trucks, corporate offices,
all in the same night. We’re talking national press.

I don’t wanna talk about the why.
Let’s talk about the how.

How are these cells communicating?
We’ve met with everyone face to face.

Who’s coordinating this?
I am.

You. Mr. High Profile.  Mr. Hammy’s Jr.

Where are these animals going?
The weakest link is the people taking care of the animals.

Each cell is responsible for taking the animals home.

Who’s writing the communiqués?
I’ve got a small team. I’ve been working with them for years.

Do they know how to write?
Can they write full sentences?

You realize these actions
are going to be represented entirely by the communiqués.

We’ve got thirty-five actions
happening at the same time.

We get one communiqué out for that.
We can control the message.

Do I know these people?
Some of them, maybe.

How do you know they can be trusted?

They don’t know each other.
They just know me.

You’ve been burned, Charlie.

You think it’s smart to be the guy
that knows everybody and knows everything?

I’m not gonna talk.
Nobody plans to talk.

Have you ever even been interrogated?
I’ve never been caught.

You’re sitting there, looking at forty years in prison.
They slide a piece of paper across the table,
saying sign here and give everyone up, and you walk.

Woah! Don’t get ahead of yourself, alright?
That is not gonna happen.

It’s gonna happen.
It’s gonna happen.

You’re getting a big head.
Don’t think I don’t see it.

All I hear from the kids these days
is Bold Native this and Charlie Cranehill that..

Hey, you tell those kids Charlie Cranehill puts his tights
on one pantleg at a time like any other superhero, alright?

You used to be cute.
Yeah? Well you used to have some balls.

Stop. Stop it. Jesus.

Every time another state outlaws cameras in factory farms
they succeed at hiding what they’re up to.

It’s gonna take something like this to get on the mainstream news.
You can bet if this is big enough they have to cover it,

they’re not gonna talk about the why, only the how,
and the how is going to be exaggerated, distorted and sensationalized.

At some point people are going to start asking
why we’re willing to risk everything for these animals.

You’ve got way too much faith in people, dude.

I’ve got faith in us.

I’ve got faith that we’re right.

Have you heard of the Feral Child?

That’s what I thought.

He’s been distributing photos and videotapes of his work.

There’s a chance we can stop this shit,
but we have to act now and we have to find out who it is.

Now there’s a mission for you.

The worse it gets, the more Feral Children we’re gonna see.

What we’re planning is the only way to fight that.

People in the movement have to know
That there’s a lot of us out there.

You know my history. You know I’m down,
and I like this action, but I don’t like the way you’re going about it.

And you’re not the one for the job.
Then who is?

I don’t know. Good luck.

What’s the Feral Child?

NINE WEEKS EARLIER

What the fuck? Ah!

Okay, okay! Mercy!

Twizzler?
Thank you.

Look what I found wandering the streets.
Holy Jesus. I thought we said no more strays.

Did you find him covertly hiding
from the FBI inside a pumpkin patch?

I thought you quit.

That was a long time ago.
Welcome to the edge of the earth, brother.

We’re different.
How?

Are you serious?
Yes. I mean, are animals things or are they living entities?

Because they can’t be both.

We build buildings. We create civilizations.
And we use animals in the process.

Without the human mind, you wouldn’t even have the concept
of a moral right to talk about.

An animal only has one thing. Its life.
To take that one thing away, to me that’s a moral obscenity.

And the only way around that fact is apathy.

If that’s what you want for Charlie,
then I’d say you’re the one who wants to cause him harm.

How’s it going over there?
I’m trying to make a wise man out of this stick.

You know a wise man once told me:
only a fool tries to make me out of a stick.

Have you been doing, like, work work?

I’ve been doing some hunting and gathering, no real work.
It’s been a lot of relationship making.

Right now I know how the whole system works,
so I know where the weaknesses are. I know where we can turn things.

I’ve been cutting together videos and sending them to you.
You’ve been getting the videos?

..

..

..

..

..

You work over at KDL?

..

I know they treat you like shit,

barely better than the animals,
and I know how they treat the animals.

I work with people who want to expose the conditions there,
but we need help.

What kind of help?

Did you do the whole, like, hey, I got an alias…
James Rollins.

James Rollins, how old, born where?
James Rollins, twenty-six, born in Milwaukee.

Born in Milwaukee, what street, what’s your mother’s name?
Come on, dude. I’m the fuckin’ FBI.

Maiden name was Hamilton, changed her name.
Madeline Rollins, changed her name.
Madeline Rollins.

Both your parents are alive?
Yeah.

Together?
No.

No, not together. Was your father gay?
That, that was the big problem.

What’s your favorite color?
Green.

You’re fucked. That’s Charlie’s favorite color.

We knew we had you!
No.

Daniel, I’m running the risk of my life

the chances of getting it right

are slim to none, but I’ve got one.

Down, down to the horsey track

we place our wagers on their heads

and hope our horsey does the best

‘cause it takes your best not to remember.

I know you love him.

You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t.

So be here. We’ll see what happens.

Run, run, little horsey run.

She’s burning, she’s burning, she’s burning up.

That’s really it.

Oh, not the orange jacket!

Let’s see what you got.

I raise.
Oh, you guys already had your shoes off?

Baby, you understand you have to have
a hand here on this one, right?

Sock is in.
Alright.

Who just stole my hand?
You’re taking it home.

Come on.
Alright.
There you go.

I have always been fascinated by your chest hair pattern.
Always!

You like this?

Ooo, do that again. Do that again.
I can’t do that again.
No, that was amazing.

I see the tide, crashing in on your man cleavage. It’s just like..
I see an owl, look, with the little eyes..
And the nipples are eyes.

Okay, let’s, uh… let’s deal the next hand.
No, let’s look at your nipples.

Okay, this is already pretty ripe.
Check.
Check.

Why are you still in this hand?
There we go.

Alright, well.. I guess you revealed your cards.
It is on you, mon frere.

What do you got, what do you got? Hm? Let’s see
You...

Don’t do it.
Nothing.

Do it!
Don’t do it.
All in.

I figured it would come to this point.

What you got, baby?

Too sexy for my blood, I fold.

Alright, let’s see ‘em.
You just did.
The cards, slim.

Three queens, Elizabeth.
Full house, Doogie Howser

You’re fucked forever!

Card shark!
Don’t cry.
Naked boy.

That’s it, I’m done.
Aw, really?

I am going to bed

right after I stick my tongue in your mouth.

I’ll miss you terribly, and I will miss you terribly

Give me this.

Good to see you.
Good to see you.

Behave... or don’t

Goodnight.

Can I have my clothes back?

Okay.

It’s not the shake in the boy that counts, it’s the boy in the shake.
And what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

Means I missed you

I missed you too.

I don’t think Wyatt would like that.

Wyatt’s a good slice. We’ve got an understanding.

Oh no.
Yes, yes it’s coming.

You! At the end of the table!

Sorry, I’d like to propose a toast to Jane.
Yes!

As you all know she had some good news today.

Jack Sanders has agreed to all the terms
she proposed, all of them.

Another fast food corporation on board.

You mean gets on the “happy meat” train right?
Not tonight, come on Dennis.

I’m sorry to rain on your parade.

What have you really accomplished except making people feel better
about imprisoning and killing animals for pleasure and profit?

As long as they’re property they’re going to be exploited.
Dennis, shut up.
No, no, no, no, no, he’s right.

No, he’s not right
He’s right to be unsatisfied.

I think it’s a little selfish to want everything or nothing.
The animals don’t benefit from that.

They would prefer to live in slightly better conditions,
and they would prefer to be killed in slightly more humane ways.

And if that is all we can get right now,

I think it’s worth it.

And you think anyone else will see it that way? Or do you think
they’ll go buy their double bacon cheeseburger with a sense of peace,

knowing that these animals were treated well?

Someone needs to speak out and not just get these petty,
you know, legislation upgrades.

The only change that has ever been made is when someone spoke up,
when someone said, “It is not right to have slaves.”
She is speaking up!

That’s exactly what she’s doing!
When do you ask for what you want?

I can’t panic because they need help now!
They do need help now.

So do something now
I am doing something now.

Don’t do something that will improve their living conditions
five years from now, ten years from now.
Stop, this is a party for her, alright?

It’s okay.
No, no, seriously.

There is a majority of people
who feel it is their right to eat meat,

their biblical right, and we have to talk to them.

I think the only moral choice is to take the choice away.

But it’s not possible.
Dare to dream, Jane.

And how’s the piece coming?
You wanna see?

Yeah.

Don’t say anything, okay?
I won’t

Promise.
Sure.

This is George.

See? It’s just a dumb animal.

I guess he could be feeling emotions like ours,
or it could just be instinctual reactions.

Take away language and all we can do is guess.

Hi Jumper! Hi.

Must be nice to have some company
through these lonely nights.

Shut up!

We just have to keep the line moving
and sometimes the pigs fall on the floor
and that’s when you have to do it.

George owns the company
that employs our friend on the TV here.

I’ve see people just take a hammer and start hitting them.

I’ve seen pigs with their whole heads crushed
just get thrown inside the dead box and three days later,
they’re still alive.

We take the water hose and stick it down their throat
and blow them up until the buttholes pop out.

We drown them to death.

Today I came to work
and there was one pig in the dead box staring at me.

My manager asked me to take care of it
and you want to know what I did?

It’s called thumping.

I picked it up by the legs
and smashed it against the cement.

My clothes were covered with blood.

That’s why I came here to talk to you.
Because I don’t think I can do it anymore.

George ordered that they turn the voltage down on the stunner

because it tends to ruin the meat,
and they have to sell it at cut rate for hotdogs.

Of course, that leads to the hogs
going through the line conscious and all,

but George has got confidence in his men to deal with that.

A hog comes out kicking too much, I let it go.

I’m not going to take another kick in the face

just because old man Masseray
wants to keep his line running at impossible levels.

That hog hits the tub, goes all the way through the scald tank,
out to the dehairer, and to the dry kill… alive.

I’ll kill him after he’s had his hooves off,
his toes cut down for the meat hooks, when it’s nice and safe.

You lied to me!

Oh, you thought I was going to use the footage
to cut together a piece to send to our congressman?

I didn’t work at a shitheel bar for three months
so you could torture people with this footage!

It’s not torture, it’s an enhanced interrogation technique.
That’s funny.

I am forcing empathy upon someone
who refuses to experience it!

This is a very complicated conversation
for the middle of the night. What’s going on?

Charlie has concerns.
Oh, about hoo-hoo-ha-ha?

Charlie...

You didn’t tell me what you guys were doing.

Cranehill, have you seen one of these? Like, actually up close?
Yeah.

Of course you have, so have I.
It’s a pig-sticker.

This is how they kill them.

They just stick them right into their fucking necks
and let them bleed out.

Do you know who’s never seen one of these until two days ago?

George.

He’s built a multi-million dollar corporation, bought an estate,
sent four fat bastard children through Groton and Loomis,

takes the two and a half week vacation to Fiji every year,
had never fucking seen one of these.

This is a guy who’s spent his entire life putting miles and miles
between him and the  blood that he spills,

and all we’re doing is lessening that distance a little bit.

Do you remember that video that you sent us?

The one with the Mexican guy who had the big scar from here to here
because the pig kicked him when he was trying to slaughter it?
Yeah.

That was a good look right?

Maybe George could use something like that.

Don’t you want them to suffer for what they’ve done?

Don’t you think that he deserves to feel a little pain
in exchange for the suffering he’s caused,

all in the name of making a buck?

Fuck, you know what that man has done!

Don’t you want him to suffer?

Yeah. I do. I want him to suffer.

Goodnight.
‘Night.

It’s a good thing, man

Ouch.  Hello?

Let’s go! Let’s go.

Shut the fuck up.

She went all Colonel Kurtz, huh?
Yeah.

Chop ‘em up?
No.

What, no machete?
Fresh out.

Look what they did to me! Look at this! Huh? You see that?

Yes! I see. Just like I’ve seen what you’ve done.

None of it’s okay with me.
Just find a new line of work!

He was a motherfucker, Sonja.

You read the books, watch the videos.
It’s the kind of shit you wish would happen.

They build the cages, we crack them open.
That’s the way of the world.

If we start building the cages, our hearts will die.

Where’s Ricki at these days?

Well, they’ve certainly made the high life.
You think they’re in on it?

I’d recognize your work anywhere.

She wants a dossier on every one of these creeps.

You gotta hand it to her.
She put together the all-star team.

Factory farm owners, slaughterhouse owners,
breeding facility owners, laboratory owners, 

USDA supervisors, congresspeople, lobbyists,
government officials, advertising execs, fast food moguls...

The very people who profit most from the suffering and death
of over nine billion animals a year.

My dad’s on this list.
Guess your dad’s a creep.

You know what she’s doing?
Nope. Don’t want to.

Trust me?
Is love a four letter word?

Don’t give Riley any more info.
Civil war?

Rogue state, Ricki, rogue state.
Silencio.

How long has it been since you saw Charlie?
t’s been a while.

It doesn’t sound like it’s good between you two, is there a reason?
Only one that I can think of.  I’m an imperialist pig, and he’s not.

Do you want him to be?

Here take this.
What’s this?

It shoots a stun ray that will incapacitate security guards
for about seven minutes.
Seriously?

No Captain Jackass, it’s a pen. It writes shit.

This is our greenhouse. You want to put your hand in manure?
No, I think I’ll pass.

It’s warm.

You can’t feel it on the outside.
You gotta stick your hand inside.
I’m not doing it.

So how many actions do we have?
A little over thirty.
Nice.

All in the same night, all over the country.

But if we really want to make a dent,
we’re gonna need to hit infrastructure.

Well, we could scramble the truck routes
and shut down all the corporate computer systems.
Yeah, I like that.

Okay, you’re really creeping me out now.
You know? If you interrupt my meditation again,

I will open a medieval can of whoop-ass on you.
Bring it, Casper

Jesus Christ.
My skills are epic. Watch my feet. Watch my feet.

Stop moving your feet.
Your death will be swift and cinematic!

Roundhouse.

Fall back grasshopper, fall back.

Aww come on, man! Fuck this noise.

I’m gonna get some burritos.
Bitchin’ out Sonja?

Just taking a break twinkle toes.
Oooo! Low blow, skank.
Yeah, well, that’s my M.O.

This Karl Hanson’s a vegetarian.
So?

So what’s he doing creating ads for the poultry industry?
I don’t know.

What’s the Feral Child?

It’s a path we don’t want to go down.

You are going to love this place.

What is that? That is fucking dope.

There’s probably somebody sleeping in there right now.

It’s a wonder van.
Karl.

Have you had your spanking today?
Have you had your spanking? Because I will spank you.
I have not.

Ow! Jesus!
Come on, it’s a butt not a testicle, let’s go.

God, your ass is firm!
Thank you.

Are you kidding me? Is that a zipline?
Alright, are you ready to do this Karly?
Frickin’ yeah. You’re going first.

I was born first.

Woooo! Oh God.
Come back strong, come back strong.

All right, my turn, my turn, my turn.

I’m going to go get some more wood.
I’ll be right back.

Hi Charlie.

Do you know who that is?
It’s okay. He needs to talk to you.

Are we on a mission here? Are we together?
Yes.

I’ve traveled this country the last two years
hunting down every animal liberator I could find

and putting together the largest coordinated effort
this movement’s ever seen.

I’m not here to chat with my father okay?

Do you know what we’re doing tomorrow night?
You think he’s going to hop in the car with us?

Isn’t that what you really want?

Fuck! Are you fucking crazy?

That is the only real way of winning this thing,
to talk to the other side.

He’s not here for a joyride. He doesn’t just want to talk.
He doesn’t want to see how I’m doing.

Why is he here?
Why? Because he loves you.

No, he didn’t tell you why he’s here.
Give me a little credit.

I’m surprised you’re not in handcuffs right now.
Good work. I’ll give you credit for that.

Come on Boy Band! Hustle! What?!?
Who’s your daddy now?

Who is your Daddy?  Winner winner, soy chicken dinner!
Sonja!

Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick.
Where’s Charlie?

Gee Mr. Cranehill, Charlie and I kind of
drifted apart after high school.

It’s good to see you though, huh?
Come on!

I don’t believe you.
Really? I was trying so hard.

That way.

She says you need to talk to me?

How you doing?
I’m fine. You?

Yeah, well, I’ve been better.
How’s business?

Charlie, what are you doing?
Talking to you.

I need you to be honest with me right now, okay?
Great, might as well try that.

I’m just trying to talk to you Charlie, that’s all.
You are talking to me, Dad.

Are you this Bold Native, this terrorist?

Is that what they told you?
You tell me.

Okay. Bold Native’s not a person. It’s an idea.

That animals are not property, they’re not ours to use.
They’re an end unto themselves.

Their freedom is beautiful, and their slavery is a horror.

You’re going to hurt somebody someday Charlie,
and that’s something that you can’t take back.

That’s not what we do, Dad.

Violence isn’t going to get you anywhere.
I agree.

Then what are you doing this for?
Doing what?

Burning down buildings and destroying property, for Christ’s sake.
God! You miss the whole fucking point.

You’re distracted by the fire. Who cares?
People care.

Who cares? You can’t commit violence against property, okay.
Isn’t that what your whole system is based on?

Animals are property, so killing them isn’t violence.

It’s processing or it’s rendering or confinement,
anything to keep from calling it what it really is.

Beef not cow, pork not pig, get it?
Poultry, not chicken..

Your whole system is a lie, a disgusting, filthy lie.

Charlie, listen to me. Listen to me!

The federal government is looking for you.
Do you know what that means?

It means they’ve been corrupted by agribusiness corporations.
No, it means you could go to prison for a fucking long time.

Is that what you want?
No, dad. I don’t want to go to prison.

I can buy you a new identity. We can hide you someplace.
Hide me?

Yeah, like, I don’t know.. Mexico maybe.

Mexico? I’m an American, Dad.
Believe it or not that means something to me.

What are you going to do?
It’ll be big, bigger than anything they’ve seen so far.

You could be part of it.

Jesus. Fuck.

Please Charlie, come home.

Please Son, just come home.

Look, you can do anything you want.

You can stay up late, play music loud, eat pizza.
Miss meetings, it doesn’t matter.

Please, come home. I need you.

Charlie, I miss you.

Don’t ask me to do something you’d never do, Dad.

Come on, Charlie. Focus for me. Really, I’m serious.

I have a lot of friends who could help.

I’ve made a lot of friends over the years, connections,
and I’ve garnered a lot of favors..

and all you have to do is just be a little contrite, that’s all.

Just say that you know what you were doing was wrong,
and you’re sorry for it, and they’ll step up to the plate.

Then, if you still want to do all you can for the animals
then we’ll find a group that does the same thing

only in the legal way,
and I’ll help you with that Charlie. I’ll help you with it.

Will you hold onto this for a second?

I’ll go with you if you kill this dog.

What the hell’s the matter with you? I’m not gonna kill this dog.
Why not?

I thought you wanted to save animals’ lives.
I saved this dog’s life years ago,
so I guess it belongs to me, right?

You’ve got no problem buying animal bodies
from people who claim to own them.

Don’t tell me you’re too weak to kill one yourself.

What’s one little dog’s life compared
to the safety of your own son?

I’m really losing my patience here Charlie.

Oh, I’m sorry. Fuck! I didn’t mean to tax your patience.

If I told you I’d go with you if you ate a steak
you’d sit right down and eat it, right?

If it makes you feel better, you can eat the dog after you kill it.
Stop being a child, will you?

Come on, do it! One quick slash to the throat,
a little blood and all your problems are over.
Stop it.

Kill it! Kill it. Kill it.
Stop it!

Kill the animal!
Stop it!

They live in unbearable pain and loneliness
just so you can sell their bodies a little bit cheaper,

make a few more cents than the other guy,
you evil fucking bastard.

Your patience is wearing thin?
Well mine’s fucking gone.

I’m the most impatient motherfucker you ever met.

You think your stinking evil has no impact?

Billions of animals a year, they don’t matter?
Believe me, they do.

Now kill the fucking dog, you fucking hypocrite.

This is all your kingdom’s based on.
You live without love, Dad.

That’s a pretty sweet speech you gave.

It was badass.

Kill the animal! Kill the animal!

You know where I hear is really nice this time of year?
No, where do you hear is really nice this time of year?

Fuckin splitz-ville
Oh yeah?

I hear it’s not raining dear old dads with control issues.

If you need to go I’ll understand,
but I don’t think I can run from this one.

I mean, if we leave, he’ll definitely flip us,
and we can’t get far enough in that time.

Maybe you can, if I stay here.

I’m like a broken record, Charlie,

all the way to the end, all the way to the end, all the way to the end...
I know, I know.

This is Richard Cranehill.

You just want to know I’m going to be okay.

Yeah, Charlie, that’s all I want.

I am.

I’m okay.

I’ve never been so totally okay in my life.

You gotta trust me on this one, Dad.

Okay.

And I wanted to thank you.

Without everything you taught me,
I never could’ve organized something this big.

If you can’t accept my choices,
maybe you can accept my gratitude.

Thanks, Pop.
Oh Charlie.

Hey, you guys got a minute? I need some help.

I got some pretty heavy stuff
that I gotta bring up to the top.

Police! Get on the ground.

Get on the ground.

Charlie, don’t!

Charlie!

Drop the knife!

Drop it!

I need you to stay free, okay?

Drop it!

Get on the ground.

Alright, let’s hook ‘em up.

What is the nature of your participation in these Bold Native actions
that you’re promoting on your website?

Aren’t you advocating this kind of criminal behavior?

I believe in the Bold Native.

I believe in freedom.

I believe a cage is a cage
and no one deserves to be put in one.

I would love to be let out of mine,

but I’m not willing to sacrifice another living being
to one in order to achieve that.

So you’ll have to forgive me
if I don’t recognize someone else’s right to do it

just for a motherfucking hamburger.

Thirty-five actions in thirty-five states,
all on the same night.

Thirty-five communiqués all issued through the website
run by you and your girlfriend.

Sounds like a conspiracy,
sounds like you’re right in the middle of it.

We are just a conduit for information.
It’s called journalism.

Do you go out with them when they do this, Randy?

What people are we even fuckin’ talking about?

We’re kind of fuckin’ talking about Charlie Cranehil, Randy.
Crano?

Cranehill.
Cranehill. Nothin’.

What is the nature of your relationship with Richard Cranehill?
There’s no relationship between Mr. Cranehill and me.

That’s not what we heard.
You heard wrong.

What was Charlie Cranehill doing on your land?
Gardening.

I don’t know if you notice you’re in handcuffs.
I did notice that.

Ricki’s already given us names.

Are you really willing to rot in jail
while she just rolls on to the next guy?

We’ve already talked to everybody in your community.
You may have their back, but they don’t have yours.

Do you really expect us to believe that you don’t know
who any of those people are?

I know nothing. 1-2-3 nothing.

You can talk to us.
My lawyer’s on her way.

Sit the fuck down, Randy!
You punch me, we have a problem.

I need one cc of dex.

I’m a hemophiliac, I’ll bleed internally ‘til I die.

Motherfucker, I don’t give a fuck what you are,
I will beat your ass with this fuckin table.

I don’t know what you’re talking about.

I’ll ask you one more time.
Ask me twice.

So you had plenty of chances to escape.

They said that they were going to tell my parents
that I had not escaped the snares of the homosexual lifestyle.

Okay, so rather than come out of the closet
as a thirty-five year old man,

you decided to go cross-country joyriding
with a self-confessed terrorist?

I was scared.
I didn’t see anything. I just want to go home.

What did Cranehill whisper to you
while he was getting apprehended?

He said that they would let him write letters from jail.
He told me my parents’ address.

If you’re lying to me, I’ll fuck you.
And you won’t like it.

Yeah, I’m sure no one ever has.

So how long have you been involved with Bold Native?

Can I smoke?

Sure.
Too bad I don’t smoke, suckas!

Hey!
Oh!

We’re not playing here, okay?

Now I know you want to play games and all that shit.

I’ll get a judge and jury,
and they’ll play a fucking game with you, okay?

You motherfu..

we take threats against America seriously.

Quit fuckin’ with me, kid.
Okay.

Alright? Don’t fuck with me.
Okay!

Quit fuckin with me.
Sorry.
Goddamn it.

Charlie loves America.

So do I.

Jesus, I’m hot for America.

I want to push America up against the wall,
and I want to fuck her senseless.

And then I want to give her a bubble bath
and feed her some chocolate.

Yeah. We go way back, me and America.

That’s my girl!

I got nothing.

Swaaamp.

Well, I’m not gonna lie.
It was a little scary at first…

…but Tiffany, can I be honest with you?
Please! That’s why we’re here!

What was really scary was finding out the truth
About how we treat these farm animals.

The authorities are keeping the identities
of the terrorists secret right now,

but can you give us a scoop on who your captors were?

You know, this is gonna sound crazy,
but I think that they were heroes,

and I know that they were against terror of all kinds,

especially the terror that we cause animals in these factory farms.
I must say, it does sound like you may have been brainwashed.

When you witness cruelty, no matter who the victim is,
you have to ask yourself,

 if you can see what’s happening,
will you turn away and do nothing?

Wait a minute, wait a minute!
You have kept me on hold now for twenty minutes.

I’ve been watching the news on the attacks.

The attacks that happened while my son was in your custody,
so obviously he had no information for you.

Well somebody’s gotta know where the hell he is!

My son is not an enemy combatant!
He’s an American, goddamn it, with rights!

Yeah!

Your noon appointment is still waiting.
Right, right. Send her in.

Hello, Mr. Cranehill.
Hello.

Jane Harold.

Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

Thank you. So, hopefully you have had a chance
to look at the material we sent.

I read it.

Great! Okay.

So, our first request is that you consider matching the humane standards
as practiced by the other fast food companies that we’ve been dealing with.

The first requirement is that your suppliers
provide seventy-two square inches per laying hen.

Will that make them happy?
Happy?

Happy.

Isn’t that your goal?

Did you know that a laying hen, if given a choice,
will build a nest rather than eat,

even though they haven’t had any food in twenty hours?
Did you know that?

So, why don’t we provide building material,
nesting material for them?

And maybe give them access outside so they can dustbathe?

Give them some semblance of a real, normal life,
in exchange for what we take away from them.

What do you think about that?

That would be above and beyond
what we’re asking for today, but..

I have a question for you.
How do you do it?

How do you come into offices like this and squabble
with people like me over a few extra inches?

How is it that you can sit there, in your politeness,
and your grace, and basically ask people for nothing?

How do you do it?
How do you beg for little scraps of humanity?

I... I think change is change.

Challenge me. Tell me what you want.

We, uh…

What do you mean?

Tell me exactly what you want from me.
I’ll do anything you ask.

I want you to stop.

I want you to stop.

I want you to stop killing for money.

I want you to stop selling the flesh of animals.

I’m gonna quit this job,

and if anybody asks I’ll tell them exactly why.

But that’s all I can offer you.
I can’t change this company.

This company would chew me up,
just like those baby chicks.

How do you know all this?

I don’t know if any of what you do makes sense.

But I wish it did.

Goodbye, Ms. Harrold.

Thank you.

Animals were harmed during the making of this movie.

But not by us.

Lat year, 10 billion animals were killed for food in the US alone,
after being raised in extreme confinement.

Over 150 million animals were caged
and tortured in American Laboratories.

Every vegan saves at least 90 individual lives each year.
