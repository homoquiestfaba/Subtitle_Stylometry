What are you doing?

Please, no. Please, please! (ECHOING)


Please, please!

Explain to me again
why we didn't fly?

Where's the fun in that? Explain
to me why we wouldn't drive?

Look at this. At least in this case,
we've got, you know, good food,

and you know, campy
roadside attractions and...

Brother-in-law. Ha, ha, ha.

Hey!

Oh, your breath.

Oh my gosh, Mags, do you remember that
trip we took with Kim? I can't believe...

she threw up like three times.
Disgusting!

Your cousin Kim?
Your hot cousin Kim?

SAM: Oh, seriously!

DAN:
Hey, Luke, can you pull over up here.

Ah!

Just throw it at him.
Be gentle. Don't hurt him.

What the fuck? Ow!

Nice.

DAN: Really, dude, really?

I pissed in my shoe.

What happened, Buddy? Sorry.

That's not funny. Come on,
let him in. Let, let him in.

Are you serious?


Thanks a lot.
I pissed all over my shoe.

Real funny, guys.
Eh, it was your wife's idea.

Oh, you sold me out!
What? I'm sorry.

Well in that case, the joke's on you.


So what's this new promotion
Maggie told me about?

Um, I moved from account manager
to senior account manager.

What does that mean?

Basically now I'm just a fall guy
in case a client isn't happy.

That sucks.

Yeah, actually it does.

What about you? How are
you enjoying civilian life?

Yeah, it's all right.
You know, work's pretty bland.

A bunch of cushioned fat asses
just pushing papers all day long,

no idea how good they've got it.

Uh-huh, right.

So I guess you miss it?

What, the military? Yeah, sometimes.

I miss my buddies
back there, you know?

I don't miss being so far
away from Maggie, though.

Yeah.

Did you ever see any action
while you were over there?

Nah, nothing much, you know.
Mostly it's just time on base.

Did you ever kill anybody?

I'm sorry. I don't... That was...

We're room six, you're five.

Come grab your bags.
All right.

What the fuck is in this?

How long were we asleep?
A couple of hours.

Hey, what time is check-out tomorrow?

Eleven, but I want to
be on the road by six.

Six? Are you serious?

Continental breakfast probably
doesn't start until what, like eight?


Fine, whatever. Six it is.

It's all right.

Good night.

Good night.
Yup.

Hey, Hon, come on, wake up.
Are we here?

Hey, Babe, did I pack any of my MREs?

You need those?

Maybe not.

Definitely not.

This looks cool.

So I'm thinking maybe tomorrow we can
actually stop and see some of these sites.

Aw, Sweetie, I know.

Isn't that the point of
the road trip anyway?

You just have to try
to get along with him.

He's not a bad guy.
He's just a bit of a...

Dick?

MAGGIE: Yes! Yes! Yes!

(MUFFLED GROANS, SIGHS)

Oh my God!

No, no, no, no, no.

Tomorrow we will stop, promise.

You know I love you, right?

Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah!

My map!

Oh, careful there, stud.

You sure we packed everything?
Yes.

Somebody had a lot of fun last night.

Hm. I'm not the only one.

So, Luke, you think today we might
actually have time to see some sights?

Yeah, I don't see why not.
Yeah?

All right, cool. Thanks, Luke.
Yep.

DAN: Does this say "Elvis rock"?

Oh, we're going to the Elvis rock.
SAM: What is an Elvis?

DAN: Are you serious
right now? Is she serious?

DAN: No, she's not serious.
She's obviously insane.

(CHUCKLES)
SAM: Yes.

DAN: ...person, Viva Las Vegas?

(CHATTER IN THE CAR)

I don't like Elvis.
I don't even know Elvis.


Let's see what the map says.

Are you serious? We have to walk?

Through the desert.

Oh, come on, guys. It'll be fun.

Yeah. Come on, guys. It'll be fun.
Fine.


Couldn't your sister just ask?



I think it's just right up there.

It better be!

Huh.

Okay.

Well, it doesn't look
exactly like Elvis.

Wait a second.

Hey guys, actually...
here, check this out.

Check it out. I actually think
it looks a lot like me, huh?

(ALL TOGETHER) No.
Come on. Here, Sam, take a picture.

We're leaving.

SAM: Smile.
(CHUCKLES)

Awesome!

LUKE: Come on, Jackass.

Oh, you guys are just jealous.

Come on!

Hey!

(CAR STARTS)

Hey!

Hey, stop!

Come on!


What happened?

We had to stop. We just had to
stop and look at that stupid rock!

All right. This is not my fault.

Luke, stop it.
Hey, you're the one who wanted to stop.

He's the one who wanted
to take this stupid road trip

to begin with.
How could we have seen this happening?

If we had stuck to my schedule like
I wanted to, we'd still have a car.

All right. You know what?
What are you trying to say?

What am I trying to say?
Yeah.

I'm saying that your punk
ass got our car jacked.

Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, stop it.

Hey, stop it.

Fighting is not going
to help anything.

Let's just call somebody to
help and get out of here.

There's no service. I already tried.

Well let me just check my map.
Maybe there's something on here.

I saw a town about a mile
from here. Let's go.

Let's go!

Come on. Give me my map back.
There you go.

Thank you.

There.

Come on!

Come on, Pansy.

There you go.

Don't forget your girlfriend.


Hey, let's just go see if they have
a phone we can use. All right?

Look at all the stuff.

So we're just going to walk
up to their back door?

LUKE:
Yeah, is that all right with you?

Look, just follow my lead, all right?
Let me do the talking.

You know, it's not working.

What? Fine.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

DAN: He he, you scared her.

Can I help you folks?

Yes, sir. Do you have
a phone we can use?

Everything all right?

Someone stole our car. We need
to get ahold of the police.

All right. Nancy?

Come on in.

Watch your step.
It's hot out there. Come on in.

My home is yours.

If you'll excuse me.
Oops, sorry.

So, telephone is right over here,
and the sheriff's phone number

is right on the handset.
Great, thanks.

Nancy, Honey.

NANCY: Coming.
Uh-hm.

Sorry I got spooked like I did.
Oh, sorry about that.

We weren't trying to startle you.

That's all right, Hon. Why don't you
kids sit down here at the table?

Yeah, Nancy, she's scared of
her own shadow sometimes.

That's probably why she ran away.

So what brings you around?

Well, we were stopped to
look at the Elvis rock...

And the next thing we knew we were
watching our car drive off without us.

Oh, that's a shame.

Where, where exactly are we?
You're in Spaulding, Hon.

Oh, you're not going
to find that there.

We really ought to talk
to Jed about this.

You know, yours is about the fifth
car that's been stolen this month.

Really?
DAN: Seriously?

You know, it's that damn rock. I keep
telling them to change the signs.

You know, take them down,
get rid of them, but...

Besides, it don't look
anything like Elvis.


At all!
Not at all.

On that note, I actually
think it looks a lot like me. Huh?

Well, lookee there.
I'll be.


Don't encourage him!

It's got your nose.

Thanks for the phone.

Sure thing.
Sheriff's on his way.

MAGGIE: Oh, great, thank you.

Good. You poor kids must be starving.

Tell you what. Why don't
you go in the living room...

and make yourself at home,
and I'll fix us up some supper.

(ALL TOGETHER) Uh, Um.

Honey, why don't you make
your famous spaghetti?

Oh, that's a great idea.
What do you say?

No, we couldn't.
No. I...

Oh, come on. I'd love to.
It's no trouble at all. Really.

Yeah, sure.
Okay.

HAROLD: Come on in the living room.
Nancy will fix us some supper.

Oh, boy.

Mm. You haven't tasted her spaghetti.
You're in for a treat.

So senior account manager?

Yeah.

What does that mean?

Your guess is as good as mine.


Where are you kids heading?
Oh, every year we visit our parents...

for their wedding anniversary
up in Pennsylvania.

We usually fly, but this year,

my incredible husband decided
he wanted to take a road trip.

What? Oh, come on.
Who doesn't love a road trip?

(ALL TOGETHER) Uh, us!


Well, I do.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Well, that'd be Jed.

Excuse me.

This is wonderful.
Uh-hm.

Sheriff.
Harold.

Come on in.
Thank you.

Hey, folks. This here is Jed.
He's our town sheriff.

Hi, Jed.
Hey, Nancy.

Thanks for coming to meet us, sheriff.
My pleasure.

Now...

on the phone you said you think someone
stole your car out by the old Elvis rock?

Uh, no, we don't think anything.

We saw somebody break
into the car and steal it.

Did you get a good look at him?

No, we were pretty far away.

Well, the kids in the next town over often
think it's funny to come into my town...

and steal our cars. They think
they can get away with it, too.

I'd bet your car is over there.

Hm.
Really?

MAGGIE: That's good, right?
Well, good. Let's go get it then.

But I mean, we need to
get the car now, right?

Let's not get all puffed up now.
Let me handle your car.

Yeah, uh, okay. Um...

How long is that going to take?

One, maybe two days.


Okay.

Do you folks have a place to stay?
No, we don't.

Where's the closest
motel around here?

Hm. Closest motel...

that would be about,
oh, 30 miles, I expect.

Why don't you kids just stay with us?
We could put them up, right?

Well, uh,

I don't see why not.

No, we couldn't possibly.
Yeah, but thanks for offering.

We insist.

Thank you, Harold, Nancy.
That is very kind of you.

It's our pleasure.

Well, I better get going.

And don't worry, we'll find your car.

(SIGHS)
Yeah.

Let me walk you out.

Excuse me.

Thanks a ton, Sheriff. Appreciate it.

Eat up. After dinner,
I'll walk you down to your rooms.

Think we need the light?

Love you.
LUKE: Love you, too.

(SAW DRILLING)

I'm sure they'll find those
kids that swiped your car.

Good.

DAN: Did anybody else hear
that sound last night?

What sound?
I don't know.

It sounded like a saw or something.

Oh, that's just Jimmy.
He's always working out in the shed.

Where's Harold?

He went out early this morning with the
sheriff. They went out looking for your car.

He thinks they might have
found it in the next town over.

Oh, that's great.

Oh, thank God. That's great.

How do you kids like your food?
Oh, it's delicious.

You're quite the chef.

Thank you.

Seriously?
DAN: Come on, Dude.

This is terrible.
Why are you reading it?

It's not like there's
anything else to do.

Oh, yeah, bitch.

(BALL HITS ROOF)

Nice throw, Manning.

Sorry.

Where'd you find this guy?

What are we going to do now?

What?

Damned Elvis rock.

I know. Just don't focus on it.

Yeah, I'm trying.

Oh. Hey, let's go to that gift store.

Why? So we can get a
souvenir of this town?

Yeah.

Uh, no thank you.
(CHUCKLES) Come on!

Hey guys, hey guys. We're going to
go to this gift store over here.

Oh, Babe, babe, babe, babe.
A four-wheeler and a pink bike.

Oh, that's what we need.
Maybe that'll get us home.

Hey, you know what?

I'm going to go check in with the sheriff
and see if he's had any luck with the car.

Well could you at least
try to get along with Dan?

Look, Mags, I've seen enough
weird stuff on this trip.

Damn it, Luke. I'm serious.

He's family now, so you might
as well get used to it.

Fine. Look...

Can we just check in with the sheriff
first and then we can meet up with them?

Fine.
Okay.

MAGGIE: Go head, guys.
We'll catch up in a bit.

SAM: Okay. Have fun.

(HEAVY BREATHING)

Huh.

Weird.

Cool.
Oh.

Um. What is that?

(HEAVY BREATHING)


God, what is wrong with you?
Sorry.

That mask is so creepy.

Yeah.

Actually, this whole
place is kind of creepy.

Yeah, and it smells like
the inside of a cab.

You ready to go?

No, come on. Just give me
a few more minutes here.

Oh, Babe, look at this.

Oh, what's this?

Now are you ready?

Yeah.

Yeah, let's go.

Luke, it looks like it's closed.
Hello?

Sheriff?

I don't think anyone is here.

What the hell?

Luke, calm down. He's probably
out looking for the car.

What's with this place?
This whole town has one cop?

I don't know.

Come on. Let's go.

Bullshit!

Hello?

Sam?

Dan?

He looks happy to be here.

LUKE: Not exactly what I expected.

I don't think they're here.

Yeah, I think you're right.

(GLASS ROLLING ON FLOOR)

Luke...

We should leave.

(SCREAMING)
Hey! Mags!

Hey, hey, wake up!

Dan, wake up! Hey!

(GROANS AND GRUNTS)

What the hell?

Calm down, calm down,
all right. Keep quiet.

Try and get out of your ropes.

We're conked out!
What's going on here?

LUKE: I don't know, but you need to
calm down, all right. Just let me think.

Well, well, well. Look who's awake.

Did you guys have a nice nap?

Who are you?

Just stay calm, all right.
Just try to relax.

Relax? How are we going to relax?

Well, that's why I'm here.


All right.


Uh, oh, you're the feisty one.
Ah, there's one in every crowd.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?


I like to keep a souvenir
of my... patients.

All right.

Who's next?

That's right. You are.

Where do I want to stick you?

(GRUNTS AND GROANS)



Now get me out, go on, get me out!


Oh, shit!

Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

Oh, shit! I can't look at this.
I cannot. I can't look at this.

Up you go. Come on.

Oh, shit. Here you go.

God, shit! You killed him!

You said you couldn't watch.
He was staring at me.

Hey, take his body and put it
against the wall so it's not visible.

Come on, all right? Now is
not the time to freeze up.

Seriously?

Wrap him up in that blanket
and put him in the corner.

Come on! Let's go!


Luke, where are the girls?
Luke, where are the girls?

I don't know. They've got to be
around here somewhere though.

Now how are we going to get out of here?
Not going to be easy.

Seriously? Really, that's... that's
what you have to tell me right now?

Look, I'm not going to hold your hand and
tell you everything's going to be all right.

Everything is going to be fine.

Feel better?

Yeah.
Good. Let's go!

Now follow me.


Luke!
Mags!

Get her!


Take those two inside. I'm gonna
to take this bitch to the grinder.

You two... get those two inside.

Johnny, you get the door.
JOHNNY: You get the door.

MAN: No, you get the door.
I got the door last week.

JOHNNY: I don't feel like
openin' that door right now.

(MUFFLED SCREAMS)


MAN 1: Flip her on over.
MAN 2: Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.

(GROANS AND GRUNTS)

MAN 1: One, two, three. Upsy-daisy.

MAN 2: Ah, I got blood
all over my good shirt.

You going in head first?
MAN 1: No, I'm going in leg first.

MAN 2: Okay. So go around.
MAN 1: Okay, I'm going around.

MAN 2:
Now go around, go left, go left.

Watch her head. Watch her head.

I got her.
Yeah, yeah.

Ugh.

(MACHINE NOISES)

Man, you get to clean it this time.
Yeah, right.

I cleaned it last week.
Yeah, so it's your turn this week.

No, it's not. It's your
turn this week.

No!
Where's Jimmy, huh?

Well, what do I look like? His mom?
Well, now that you mention it.


It's the hair. It's girlie.
Shut up!

Actually, now that you mention it.
I haven't seen Jimmy for a while.

I wonder where he is.

He's probably jerking
off to his blood vials.


All right, guys. Let's go!
Oh, yeah. Cool.

Johnny, come with me.
I wanna go with them.

It's your detail, come on.

They're leaving in the truck, but I
think there's still two in the trailer.

Luke!

You hear me?

We need to get inside that building.

You think Sam's in there?
We're going to find out.

Okay, if you see anything you don't
like, you tell me immediately.

If I tell you to run, you run.
If I tell you to hide, you hide.

Got it?
Got it!

Stay close.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

What are you gonna do if they catch us?
They won't.

Look, our focus now is finding Sam
and getting out of here alive.

You need to keep a
clear head. All right?

Okay.

Down, down, down!

Nasty one, isn't she?
Oh, man.

I seen one last week

I love them feisty ones, especially when
they've got them perky little titties.

I gotta go take a piss.
You be okay for a few minutes?

Yeah, I'll be fine.
Hands off until I get back.

All right, all right. Son of a bitch!

Whew!

Mark, Johnny? Get your asses in here!

Son of a bitch!

All right, Ma, we're comin'.


Hey, let's go. Ma's callin'.

JOHNNY: Give me a minute.
What the hell are you doin'?

JOHNNY: What the hell do you
think I'm doin'? I'm takin' a shit!

Look, Ma says we gotta go right now.

JOHNNY: Oh, well, she's just gonna
have to wait a minute. (FARTING)

Come on, man. Let's pinch
it off and let's go!

JOHNNY:
I can't. I'm committed. No, no, oh.


Oh-h-h-h. Yeah.
Let's go.

Ow, man, what did you eat?
You remember that brunette last week?

Yeah.
Yeah, it was all her. Heh, heh.

She must have tasted like ass.

Let's go!

Wait, wait, wait! I'll go first.
Okay. Hey, be careful.

Right. You go first.

Right.


(MUFFLED NOISES)

Damn it!

Was there a girl with you?
Was there a girl with you?

Hey, calm down, calm down.
We're not here to hurt you.

Did you see a girl?

All right, we'll take care of it!

Bitch. What's her problem?
Probably having her period.

Yeah. No, Ma don't get her
period because of mental pause.

What the hell you talkin' about?

Well, see, everything in her
body goes on pause at her age.

Learn somethin' new every day.

Huh.

My butthole hurts.
Why would you say that to me?

Go check on Jimmy. See what's
takin' him so long in the barn.

Fine.

MARK: Right now, my butthole hurts.

Look, stupid.
It's my turn!

Shit.

What's that?

Shit!

Let's go.

(MUFFLED SCREAMS)


Calm down, all right?

We don't have time to explain, all right?
But we need to move... now!



Hey, what are you...
(SCREAMS, GROANS)


MARK: Johnny!

Let's go you son of a bitch!


MARK: Who are you?


Here, take this. Only aim
if you intend on shooting.

We should go.

You know we're telling the truth.
We're not going to hurt you.

Look, no more talking, all right. Either
come with us or they will kill you.

Look, I know it's tough, but we have
to move. We have to go now! Come on!

This is crazy!
Come on!

Let's go! We're safe with them.

Don't worry. We'll find her.


Damn!

Oh, I didn't even see you there.

I'm sorry about that,
Buddy! You all right?

Oh, damn! You shot
'im right in the face.

Wow, that's gonna leave a mark.
Oh, man.

Oh, pretty lady, you got
brains all over your face.

(CHUCKLES)
Stay back.

Whoa! Was I even talkin' to you?
I was talkin' to the pretty lady.

Woo-hoo-hoo. Heh, heh.

Hey, Sweetness. Well, lookie here.

Hey.
Hey, hey.

Where you goin', lover
boy, huh? Back up? Huh?

Hey, Mikey, we set up to make
ourselves a little movie.

I love movies.
Come on, Sweetness.

You wanna be in a movie with me?

Please?
MIKEY: Donnie's his nickname is Don Juan.

He's real gentle with the ladies.
Come on, don't cry now.

MIKEY: Now, that's gonna
be great angle there.

You don't want to disappoint your fans.
(SOBBING) Gary!

(MIKEY CHUCKLING)

You gonna cry? Oh, you gonna cry?






Take that bitch!

MIKEY: You shot my fuckin' toes off!

Go, get out of here. Go! Let's go!

MIKEY: Fuck!
(GROANING)

Ow, my fuckin' toes
are on the ground.

Aw, aw, fuck!

Oh, they're right there.
Toes are on the fuckin' floor.

Shit!




Shit!



Fuck!

Where are we going to go?

This way, in there.
Come on!

MAN: God damn it!

What the hell is this? Boots.




Damn, Donnie.

You are one sick son of a bitch!

Me? He's the one that painted
the wall with this asshole's face.

Why you always gotta
blame me for shit, man, huh?

Maybe if you could keep your pecker
in your pants for five minutes.

Maybe if you didn't pull the
trigger so fuckin' fast...

Both of you, shut up!

They shot my damn toes off!
Shut up!


Damn.

They did, did they?

You shot your own damn toes off!


Does it hurt?

MIKEY: Yes, yes!
Huh?

Good!


Both o' ya, put your panties back on and
get out there and find them assholes!

Yes, sir.

Damn it!


Donnie, get over here.
Help me up, man.

Okay.
MIKEY: Donnie, come on.

They hit me right in the nose.
Hey, fat ass!

I ain't got no fuckin' toes
right now! Geez! Aw!

DONNIE: Come one, get your ass up.
God, be careful!

What is that?

(POLICE SIREN)

I heard gunfire, what happened?
Well, Mark and Johnnie are dead.

These two dumb fucks got
the shit kicked out of them.

Damn it! Look at this place!

You two gotta start usin' what
little brains you got up there.

If anybody up top starts asking
questions, we're all fucked.

Hey! You best remember you're where
you're at right now because of me.

You work for me, you got it?

DONNIE: Yeah, dumb ass...

You got that?
You work for me.

Look... we gotta find these three,

before they become
a serious liability.

If they get out,
this whole thing goes away.

But don't go tellin'
your Ma about this.

She don't need to be bothered, all right?
All right.

You two just go find 'em.
Try not to make a mess this time.

Me? I didn't do anything.
I don't want to hear it!

Shut up! God damn it.

I want 'em back here, preferably
with their heads still attached.

Shut up, I didn't ask you.

You two just please go find 'em.

Get this dipshit in the truck
so I can get him to the doc.

What the fuck are you
doin' still standin' here?

Wait for me.

(DOOR SQUEAKS)

How you want to do this?
Well, I reckon we find 'em.

No shit. You leave that pretty little
thing for me. She's my leadin' lady.

Fuckin' perv.
I'm serious.

That bitch is gonna make me so
much money. Dead bitches on camera.

I'm gonna make myself a
website and everything.

You're one sick bastard, you know that?
I know.

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

Take your perverted ass out there.

Honey, I'm comin', where are ya?

Darlin'?

Bingo!


Come on.

Babe, you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

Okay. Let's go!

(DOOR SQUEAKS)

That way. Come on, come on!

Go, go, go!

What are you waitin' for? Go get 'em!

Come on!

Come on! Come on!

Shit! They're coming.

Come on, fast.

Help!


Hey!

That stupid son of a bitch and
his friend tried to escape.

Numnuts here shot himself.
I didn't shoot myself!

Shut up!
(GROANS)

Get up there!
Aw, fuck! Ooh!

You see this?

Yeah.
That's your blood.

I'm sorry.
On my fingertips.

I'm sorry. Aw.

Damn it. Patch him up!
(GROANS)

I gotta get back.


God damn it. Fingertips!

Fuck! Doc!


God damn it!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

Shit!

Don't think like that, he's fine.

Oh, my God!

(SAM LAUGHS)

(MUMBLED WHISPERS)


I love you...

Don't ever leave...

I love you...

I need you...

I love you so much.


(GUN COCKING)

DAN: Get up.

You don't know what you're doin'.
Yeah, I do. I'm going to kill you.

I understand you're mad.

I'm glad you understand because I don't
know what the fuck is going on here.

It's complicated.
Try me.

You don't know what
it's like livin' out here.

You take responsibility for
everything that you've done.

Please, you don't understand.

Harold...
No!

You don't say no to him.
No, fuck that, fuck Harold!

(EVIL LAUGH)

You think this is funny?

We'll see how funny you think it is with
your brain splattered against that wall.

Go ahead, do it! Do you know how many
of you we've seen coming around here...

actin' all big and tough
thinkin' you can change things?

Your fate was sealed the moment
you got off the main road.

The fuck it was.
Please.

Did my wife say please?


I don't want to die!

No one does.



Oh, fuck!



(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(DOOR SQUEAKS)

I know you're in here.

Might as well come on out.

Might let you live...

then again might not.


(LUKE COCKS GUN)

What ya got there?

Find yourself a gun?

You sure you know how to use
one of them things, boy?

LUKE: Why don't you ask
your friend right there?

What was that? You know...

you really made a
mess of things here.

You couldn't just leave,
could ya, huh?

You couldn't just run.

No, you had to stay
and play the hero.

You should have left
when you had the chance.

(LUKE YELLS) Shut up!
Don't you raise your voice at me, boy!

Oh, you think you're big and bad 'cause
you got the gun in your hand, huh?

Huh?


What I say goes.
My friends...

my wife,

they're dead because of you.

They're dead... because of you.

No!
(GUNFIRE)

I hope you burn in hell.

Son, this is hell.




(EVIL LAUGHTER)

Shit's here.

(CHOKING, COUGHING)

Get off of me, you idiot!


Oh, shit.

What is it?

What the hell's the matter?

Hey.
(GUNSHOT)

HAROLD: (YELLING) No!

GARY: Okay, get down.







Come on!

Jennafer, Jennafer!


Let her go!

Huh, let me think about that
for just one second, no!

You hillbilly piece of shit!

She is sweet! Wow.

Step back, don't come any closer.

Okay, okay. Just don't hurt her.

This pretty little thing? Why would
I go and do somethin' like that?

She's my leadin' lady.

You, on the other hand,
you I'm gonna kill.

I gotta bring you back
for the sequel, don't I?



What do we do now?
We keep moving.

Let's go. Let's go!

We need to get a car.

No, don't leave me.
I'm not leaving. I will be right back.

You have to stay quiet,
and you have to stay calm.

The only way out of
here is driving, okay?


Hurry!

Fuck!

Shit! Every piece of shit car
in this hellhole is dead.

What are we going to do?

I don't know, stay alive?
You're going to be okay.


Don't cry. Don't cry.


(CAR ARRIVES)


(CAR STOPS)


(BRAKES SCREECHING)

Get off of me!

Y'all go find 'em.

I'm comin' for ya.

What the fuck?
(SHUSHING)

Shit! Shit! Shit!

What the hell?
Battery's dead.

Keep off the clutch, I'll push.

Come on, come on,

We can't just leave him there.
They already have him.

Go! Go! Go!
We gotta go.

GARY: What? No. Holy shit!

What now?
We're being followed.

Come on!

Come on!

Come on!

Go!
I'm going!

We're losing them.

(TIRE BURSTS)

You thought you'd killed me?

Lemme let ya in on a little secret.

You can't kill me, I'm the devil.

(SINISTER LAUGH)


How does it feel?

How's what feel, boy?
(PANTING) Knowing your wife is dead?
