Some Americans are missing.

Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

The numbers don't match.

Finish assembling the pictures
from the embassy.

All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

Yes, sir, it will be done.

BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

Sahar, how are you doing?

Fine, thank you.

Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

Peace be upon you.

And upon you, sir. Welcome.

I hope you are well.

Thank you very much. How are you?

I'm very well. What's your name?

You know, sister...

...those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

But stern against the Kufar.

As God wills it.

But those who sit silently have sinned.

How else may I help, sir?

No, no, just one thing.

How long have they been here?

Pardon?

The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

They arrived two days ago.

Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

Yes, it's a fantasy story about a war
in another world.

Here you can see our notices.

Of course I speak Farsi.

I wish to make a film in Iran.

These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

Alien villains have taken over
the hero's planet.

They fight for their families and
take back the city.

The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

So he and his wife storm the castle.

The people... hold that... the
people are inspired to join him.

They are farmers, but
they learn to fight.

They shoot weapons at their enemies.

And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

The Iran Hostage Crisis ended
on January 20, 1981,

when all remaining hostages were released.

They spent 444 days in captivity.

The involvement of the C.I.A.

complemented efforts
of the Canadian embassy

in freeing the six held in Tehran.

To this day, this story
stands as an enduring model

for international cooperation
between governments.

All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service

after their ordeal in Iran.

Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers

was awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence
Medal, its highest civilian honor.

He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star
was returned to him in 1997,

when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

He lives in rural Maryland with his family.
