But then last year happened.

[boys laughing]

[boy] You're it, Oli.

Stop playing, please.

Please.

[Sam sighs]

Rueben or Oli,
can you go and see if Mum is okay?

[in singsong] I did it yesterday.
I did it the day before.

Yeah, yeah, you're overworked.
Noah should do it.

It doesn't matter who did it yesterday
or the day before.

I'm just asking you
to check on Mum, please.

[exhales]
[Rueben] Why can't Noah do it?

[Dad] Where is Noah?
[Oli] He's on the roof in his chair.

Uniforms.

Pantsâ€¦ pants off, uniforms on.

Stop it!
I'll have a whole-grain sandwich.


[boys chattering indistinctly]

[Dad] Noah! He's upstairs?

[boys chattering indistinctly]
[grunts]

[Dad] Noah?

Hang on, Sam.
[Sam] It's okay.

I'm fine.

<i>â€¦but what Mum calls her bra strap.</i>

[Sam grunts]

[somber music continues]

[Oli and Rueben chattering indistinctly]

<i>She can't feel anything from there down.</i>

I'll just get this out.


[catheter bag draining]


I'm okay.

[Rueben] Noah drank it all.
[indistinct chattering on TV]

Can you close the door, please?

[door closes]
[water turns on]




[grunting, yelling]
Oh! Are you okay?

[boys laughing]
[Sam] Watch yourself.

I've asked you not to do that already.


[Dad] Look, move that for your mum.
[Sam] Noah?

Turn the TV off.

[cartoons playing]

Mum, I can't do my laces.


Dad knows how to tie the best knots.

[Rueben] Can I go to Kai's after school?
[Dad] Not today.

[Rueben] Why not?
[Dad] Out, you lot. Go.

Oh, shit.


Can we buy our own lunches today?
It's Friday.

Can I get a pie?
Ooh, can I get a sausage roll?

Yeah, of course you can.

[Oli] Yes!
[Rueben] Mmm!

You've only been home a little while.
It will get better. I promise.



I love you.

I'll call you after drop-off.

Give us a kiss before you go.


[Sam] Bye, sweetie. Have a good day.
[Oli] Bye, Mum.

[Dad] Hey, boys. Come on, hurry.
Take this off before you go to school.


Bye, Noah.
[Rueben] Bags the front.

Hey! Do not fight, you two!

[Rueben] I'm the oldest.
[Oli] You're always the oldest.

[Rueben] Duh!
[Dad] You're in the back, Noah.

[woman sighs]

Hello, darling.

[door closes]
[woman chuckles]

[footsteps approaching]

[woman sighs]

Hi.

Hmm.

What are you doing
sitting here in the dark?

Nothing.

You need some light and fresh air in here.

Hmm, why don't you take your book out
onto the lawn?

Or do your exercises.

Remember what the doctor in rehab said.
You've gotta keep your spirits up.

[Sam whispers] Yeah.

Or try one of those podcast thingies.

I bumped into Bron in the supermarket,

and she reckons
she can be hanging out the washing

and solving a murder all at the same time.


I'd love to have a special lunch
when Kylie gets back.

Sorry?

What did you say, darling?

I didn't say anything.

Oh, thought you did.


Didn't Cam change these sheets?



What's this?


[birds continue chirping]

[dramatic music playing]
[water churning]

[boys chattering indistinctly]



[birds squawking]

A cool cubbyâ€¦
[Rueben] Great.

[cheeping continues]

[cheeping intensifies]

[lizard hissing]
[cheeping continues]


Hey. Hello.

[cheeping continues]

Are you okay?

[cheeping continues]

Maybe you should've left it there.

She would have died, Mum.

[cheeping]
She fell a long way.

in the meantime.

I just think it'd be better off
at the vet.


Well, says here a magpie's gender
can't be determined until after a year.

So, we don't know.

[Noah] It's a girl.
[Cam] How do you know?


Well, she needs a name.

No, Cam.

No names, please.

Got enough to worry about around here.

Penguin.


'Cause she's black and white.

Oh, okay.

How aboutâ€¦ Zebra?
[Cam] Skunk?

Panda?
[Cam] Panda's good.

No, how about Magician's Wand?

Chessboard.
[Oli] How about Soccer Ball? Tuxedo?

[Cam] Very good.
Penguin.

Her name'sâ€¦ Penguin.


[crickets chirping]


It's all right, Penguin.

Shh.

[cheeping continues]

[mellow music playing]

[cheeping continues]

<i>to believe what happened.</i>

<i>It's like Mum was stolen from us.</i>

<i>She used to surf with us,</i>

<i>skate with us,</i>

<i>play soccer in the sand with us.</i>

<i>She was awesome.</i>


[boys chattering indistinctly]


[Oli] Look, Peng. Look at me.
[cheeping]

Funny, Peng.
[chuckles]


Did she just poo on you?

She needs a nappy.



I don't mind.


Don't!
[Rueben] Woo-hoo!

Flying.
[laughs]

[blowing raspberries]

Ignore him, Peng.

[Rueben] You try, Noah, you chicken.
[Oli chuckles]

Can you feel this?

Can you feel this?

No.



[Penguin cheeping]


Penguin's talking to you.


What?

Why don't you like her?

She's a wild bird,

which means
she can't stay here forever. Right?

[cheeping continues]

You've gotta get your strength back.

She obviously doesn't like it, Noah.

She should.

I made it like they said online,
with bugs and stuff.

Why don't you try it?
See what it tastes like then?


Hey. Sorry I'm late.
[boys] Hey, Dad. Hi, Dad.

It was supposed to be
a normal family portrait.

Turns out
they all hate each other's guts.

And mine too, apparently,
so that was a bit of fun.

[Penguin cheeping]
[Cam] Hey.

How are you?

How's the pain? One to ten?

I'm fine.

[cheeping continues]
And you?

G'day, gorgeous.
[Noah giggles] Aw.

[Cam] Gesundheit.
[Rueben] She sneeze?

Okay, so look, I was thinking
we could have fish and chips for dinner.

[boys exclaiming]
Eat on the beach?

Can I bring Peng?
Of course you can bring Penguin.

I could carry you, Sam.

No.

It's beautiful down there. Come on.

No. You guys go.

I'mâ€¦

I'm gonna get ready for bed.

[Rueben] Come on, Mum.
It's too early for bed, Sam.


Sorry, bub.

Hey, bring me back a shell, okay?

Hey. Come on. Let's go.
[Rueben] I bet I can beat you.

I'll race you to the bedroom.
[Cam] Towels, togs, let's rock!

Oli, come on.
Yes.

[cheeping continues]

[Rueben and Oli giggling in distance]

[cheeping continues]

Never ask me that question
in front of the boys again.



I don't wanna have to lie to them.


Okay.


[breathing heavily]

Don't.

[mellow music playing]

[waves crashing]

[birds chirping]

[Noah] Do you miss your mum?
[cheeping]

[mellow music continues]

Oli.

Give this shell to Mum.


Hey, Peng.

Come and watch this. [grunts]

[Rueben] This is delicious, Dad.
[Noah and Oli giggle]

Mmm.
[Noah] Come on, Peng.


[Oli] Want one, Peng?
[Rueben] Want a bit of fish?

Or a yummy chip, Peng?

[Rueben] That's not the right one.
[Noah] She's a magpie, not a seagull.

[chuckles]
[boys laugh]



[cheeping continues]


[crickets chirping]


Dad?

Roo?

Cam, babe.

It's Rueben.

Something's up.

You okay?

[door opens]

[Rueben gagging, vomiting]


Oh, no, no.

Smells like oysters.

Cam?

[Rueben gagging]
Is he okay?

You're okay. You're okay.


[Rueben vomiting]

Penguin nearly ate one of those.

[Cam] Never again.
You could've poisoned her.

Get back, Snow, or you'll step in it.

Hey, you're gonna be all right.


Are you okay, Oli?

you'll feel better.

It's all right. That's it. There you go.
You've still got a little bit more there.

[groans]
[Rueben] I spewed in my bed, too.

Get back. Get back.
[Rueben and Oli moaning]


It's all right. You're okay.

Ah, they're fine.

[door closes]
I think it was just the dodgy oyster.

Look, we should turn while you're awake.

Hey.

[scoffs, sighs]

[mellow music playing]

Sam?

Hey, what's up?

They're fine.

They used to call out for me.

[Cam exhales]
They didn't mean anything by it.

[sobs]
Hey.

[Sam weeping]

What am I if I can't even be a mum?

[Cam exhales] You are.

No, I'm not. I'm nothing.
[Cam] You are.

[Sam sniffles]
Shh.

I hate this. I just hate it so much.

[crying continues]

I hate myself so much.

[quietly cheeping]

[Sam and boys laughing]
[Cam] No! No!

[mellow music continues]

[Sam shrieks, laughs]


<i>That's 20 million other people
this could have happened to.</i>

[screams]
[all laughing]

<i>That's 40 million other hands
that could have touched that fence.</i>

<i>A fence that was 15 years old.</i>

<i>5,475 other days it could have broken.</i>

[indistinct chattering in background]

[sirens wailing]

<i>But it waited for Mum.</i>

[sirens continue]
[frantic, indistinct chattering]

[Sam moaning]
Boys, hurry! Come.


[Noah] Come on. She'll be fine.
[Rueben and Oli crying]

She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.

I'm here. I'm here for you.

It's not enough.

I'm sorry, Cam.


[Sam whimpers]

Even the boys.



[Sam continues crying]
[exhales]

[gulps, sniffs]

Hey...
Just go.

Let me get you up into the shower.

No, I just wanna stay...
You need to get up.

It'll pass. Just...

No, I'm fine. I'm justâ€¦

Just wanna stay here.

Please.

Just get the kids to school.

[Rueben] Fish does stink a bit.
[Cam] Boys, bags. Let's go.

[Oli] Bye, Peng.
[Penguin cheeping]

[Rueben] Bye, Peng.
[cheeping continues]

That was like
a swimming pool of spew, Dad.


Mum?

Yeah?


She's still not eating very well.

Okay.

New recipe?

Bron brought it over.
[Rueben] She should bring more food over.

How was she?
[Rueben] Mmm.

How was school today, Oli?


um, stand on that thing
under the play equipment,

and then when two little kids jumped down,

he grabbed them by their undies,
pulled their undies over their, um, facesâ€¦


"Hey," and pushed him in too.

[Sam] What do you call that?
[Cam] What is that technique?

[Rueben] Wedgie. Okay.
[Oli] An atomic wedgie.

[Noah] Hey, that's my Mr. Murphy!

Can she stay?

[Noah] Please.

Come on, Mum.

She doesn't wanna be stuck inside,

[Rueben] Hi.

G'day, stranger.

Hi, Aunty Kylie.

Hi, Nan Jan.
[Rueben] Nan Jan, watch this!



Go! Go!
[squawking]

Whoo!

You're looking good.
Yeah, it was pretty amazing.

I just did lots of yoga.
I didn't speak to anyone for weeks.

I didn't drink anything.

We should get Mum to go.

[Kylie laughing] Yeah.

[Jan] Hi.
Hey.

Do you need anything?

No, I'm fine. Thanks, Mum.

What about some cheese and bikkies?

It's all good.

Nuts?

Okay, great. That sounds perfect.

[boys laughing outside]

Are you cross with me?
No.

Why would I be cross with you?
I'm the one who told you to go.

Soâ€¦

I would kill for a glass of wine.

When was the last time you went out?
I go out.

Yeah? Where? And not to the doctor's.

I mean, when was
the last time you just went out?

So, what do you say? Let's go for lunch.

That would do us a world of good.

Come on, Sammy.


[Jan] He's not even handicapped.
[Kylie] I know.

Can we please not park here?


No, Cam gave me a sticker, Sam.

I don't want to use that.
[Jan] It's convenient, darling.

It doesn't mean that...
[Sam] I don't care, Mum.

You're not a spastic.

No one thinks that.
Oh my God. I wasn't saying that.

Mum! Never ever!
[Sam] You can't say that word.

That was the correct term.
I had a cousin who was a spastic.

Oh my God.
[Jan] Mary, you remember her.

Please. I...
[Jan] She had lovely red hair.

No, I'll get the chair.

I'll get the chair.



[Kylie] Oh!
[Jan] Oh, careful.

[Kylie] It's all right.
[Jan] You all right?

Thank you.
Great, thank you.

So, what do you feel like, sweetheart?

You've gotta have a glass of wine.

[Kylie] We should share a bottle.
[Jan] Maybe a nice...

Let's do that.
[Jan] Oh, hi!Â Bron!

[Bron] Sam?
[Jan] Hi.

[Kylie] Hi, Bron.
Hi.


Hi.

How are you?

Yeah, good.
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, a silly question.

No, it's okay.
Came up to see you the other day.

Oh yeah, right.

Thanks, umâ€¦ thanks for the flowers.

Kids loved the lasagne.

Uh, I was at the physio.
[Bron] Yeah. Yeah.

No, it's okay. I get it.

I just wanted to let you know
that I'm here

and whatever you need, I'mâ€¦ you know.

Maybe see you in a few weeks, yeah.

What are you up to, Bron?

Oh yeah.
Oh.

Same old, same old.
Um, back on ward 20 in the hospital.

Oh.
Yeah.

Kids' school fundraiser's coming up.

That's about as exciting as it gets.

Are you serious?

You love the water.

You don't get it.

[squawking]
What are you scared of?

The worst that can happen
is you'll beÂ embarrassed.

Hey, Peng.
[Cam] But at least you tried.

to make me feel useless?

So, what do you need, Sam?
'Cause I'm running out of ideas.

The boys and I, we're struggling.

Oh, you're struggling?

Yes, it's all of us, Sam.

Let's go!
[Noah] Go, Peng!

[Oli] Let's go! Yeah!
[Cam] Yes!

[Rueben] Yeah!
[Oli] Good one!

[boys chattering indistinctly]


You must be the Blooms.

I'm Gaye.

Cameron. We spoke on the phone.
Uh-huh.

Cameron tells me you're quite the surfer.

Was.


And a mum. By the looks of these jokers,
it couldn't have been a walk in the park.

[all chuckling]

You seem a bit nervous.

I'm in a wheelchair.

Well, wouldn't you rather be in a kayak?


You hold the front. I'll take the back.

And, uh, pass the paddle to Sam, please.

Yep. Okay, pull it out.

So I want you to practice paddling.

Gentle hands, Cam.

Jeez, he goes in strong, doesn't he?
[chuckles]

Okay, so I want you
to think about it like it's swimming,

except you're gonna scoop the water
with the paddle instead of your hands.

Try and feel it on the blade
until you get a good catch.

Yeah. Eyes straight ahead.

You look to the side,
you'll leanÂ to the side.

Right.

Yeah, flick it off at the side
at the waist.

Good.

That's it.

The more comfortable you are,
the quicker you'll go.

Relax and breathe.
[shutter clicking]

[Rueben] You're doing great, Mum!
[Gaye] Looking a bit tense there, Sam.

[Sam exhales]
[Gaye] Okay. Okay.

Now we've come
to the most important part of the lesson.

I want you to tip over.

What?
You heard me. Get in there.

No way.

What's the worst thing that can happen?
You swim, don't you?

You still have your arms.
They must be good for something.

Come on, it's like riding a bike.

I can't do that either.

Don't make me tip you out, Sam.

You wouldn't.

Oh, I tip people all the time.
I'm known for it.

I can't.

Can't do it.

This is the easy part.

This is falling off the bike.

I said I can't!

Three, two, one.

[Oli] Hey, remember that time we went...
Yeah!

[indistinct chattering]

[birds chirping]




It'll soon be time for you
to move out of home, girl

or start paying rent.


[crickets chirping]

[Cam sighs]

You were incredible today.
Gaye thinks you've got talent.

Hey, thanks for pushing me.

And I'm sorry you have to live with this.


Are you kidding?
[exhales]

I consider myself the luckiest man alive.

Oh, shut up.

How so?

[chuckles softly]

Because for a nightâ€¦

I sat thinking I'd never see you again.

But I did.

I do, every day.


Soâ€¦ soâ€¦ [clears throat]

I've been reading up on magpies.

[Sam] Oh yeah?
Oh yeah.

Turns out they mate for life.

Really?

Totally monogamous.

One and only.

their soul mate, and game...

[chuckles] You areâ€¦
Game over. It's game over.

Well, maybe that explains why they're
so miserable and angry all the time.

What is wrong with you?
[Sam] You! What's wrong with you?

You are such a cheeseball.
You're crazy. Crazy.

Ah!

[Rueben roars]
[Cam] Happy birthday!

[boys] Happy birthday!
[Sam] Oh!

Oh my, look at all of this.
[Cam] Here we go.

Aw, thank you. Peng, my Peng.

"Get that bloody bird out of the house"?

I didn't say that, did I?

[Cam] Budge up.
Don't listen to him.

Let me in.
Three, two, and open fire!

[Sam and boys cheer]
[Cam] Hey, wait.


[all cheering]


[Rueben] Shrunk quite a bit, Mum.
[chuckles] I reckon.


What about you, Oli?


[Sam] Oh, you cheater.
[Rueben] Cheater.

Don't forget Penguin.

Come on, Peng. Maybe I can get aâ€¦

[Rueben] So, where is it again? Here?
[Noah] Mm-hmm.

[Oli chuckles]

Mum loves the ocean. She always has.

Mum met Dad...
Hey.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

[camera beeps]

It's just a thing.

[laptop closes]

What sort of thing?

Iâ€¦ I can pack these up.

Do you need anyâ€¦

I mean, I can help if you like.

No. It's fine.

I'll pack them up.

Hi.

[unlocks door]

Hey, Nan.
Hello.

[all] Hi.
[Jan chuckles]

[Penguin squawking]
Oh, you brought Penguin. How nice.

Hi, Mum.
Hello, sweetheart. Happy birthday.

Thank you.

Quickly, quickly, carry.
Hurry. Come on.

Hide them, quick.
Come on.



Oh, Sammy, you're so old.

[both laugh]

Uh, I'll wear it well.

And I got you bubbles, but I got...

Look, I got the cheap stuff
'cause you can't taste it.

Oh great. Thanks. Keep it coming.
[Kylie] Yeah. Love you.

[both kiss]
[Kylie] I love you.

Kylie!

This table isn't gonna set itself.
Come on.

Okay. Okay, Mum.
[Jan] And use the good napkins.

I have waited over a year for this.


Oh no.

Oh, I swear that bird
does it to me just to annoy me.

[squawking]
[doorbell rings]

[Sam] Sorry, Mum.
[Rueben] I'll get it.

[Sam] Thanks, Roo.
Do you have to be inside?

Shoo, shoo! Shoo!
That'll be Gaye.

[Penguin squawks]
Oh! Sorry. Sorry, Jan.

So, Gaye, you reckon Sam's got a shot?
Oh yeah.

So, she'll be spending a lot of time
in the water?

Yeah, training three times a week.

It sounds dangerous.
And Sam can't swim, can you?

I haven't drowned a student yet.

But my ex-husband, wellâ€¦
that's a whole other story.

[all laughing]

You know, um, myâ€¦ my students,

theyâ€¦ they usually take
a long time to find their balanceâ€¦

There you go, Peng, some fresh air.

like a duck to the water, this one.

Honestly, it's the first time
I've felt normal since the accident.

When I'm kayaking,
I look like everyone else.

Well, thank goodness for Gaye. [chuckles]

Someone's gotta get Sam out of the house,
be proactive.


Mum, what...
That's what Cameron does every day.

I wasn't saying that.
[Kylie] Mm-hmm.

I didn't mean that, Cam.

[Cam] I know.
[Jan] All I'm saying is it's very hard.

You've got your work. Sam's often alone.

She likes her independence, Jan.

But she can't walk.
[Sam] God.

I'm right here, Mum.

How much independence should she have?

Mum, I'm three feet away from you.
[Jan] No, really.

Please.

[Jan] What if something awful happened?
[Sam] Oh God, Mum.

She has her phone, Jan. She'd call.

Yeah, what if she fell
or there was a fire?

Hey, boys!
Um, how about you go jump in the pool?

[plates clanking]

Take your plates.
[Rueben] Oh, it was just getting fun.

[Oli] Will we still get cake?
[Rueben] Of course we will, ding-dong.

[Noah] It's chocolate.
[Oli] Don't call me a ding-dong.

What if she couldn't reach her phone?

[Sam] Oh my God.
[Jan] What if it wasn't charged?

We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan.
We live our life.

[Sam] Cam, don't.
[Jan] Oh yes.

All fun and no responsibility.
Look where that's got you.

I might, uh, go for a swim as well.
Please sit down, Gaye.

It's fine.
And, Jan, if you're implying...

No, she's not implying. It's justâ€¦

Leave her alone.
She's drunk and emotional.

I heard that.

Well, yes, of course.
You're three feet away, Mum.

When your poor father died...
Oh.

I'm just... Okay.
[Cam] Sit, please.


When your poor father died, I thought,
at least I've still got the girls.

But now
I just lie awake at night worrying.

And I don't?

All I ever do is worry.

I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam
or too sad in front of the boys.

I worry if I should take them
to the beach

or if that's us being selfish. I worryâ€¦

I worry if I do too much for Sam
or not enough.


I worry Sam can't walk
because I moved her after she fell.

No, darling,
that's got nothing to do with it...

Believe me, Jan. I worry.

I'm sorry, love. I'm justâ€¦

I'm just scared.

I wanna make my little girl well again,
and I can't.

And it makes me crazy. I just...
Shh.

Well, don't shush me.

No, no, no. Shh.

Can you hear that?
[Cam] What?

Is that Penguin?


[Cam] Hey! Hey! Leave her alone!
[banging]

[Sam] Oh no!
[Kylie] Penguin!


Penguin!
[Kylie] Penguin!

[Cam] Leave her alone!
Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Leave her alone, you mongrels.

Oh no.

No!


Peng!
[Noah] Penguin!

Peng!



[Noah] Peng!
[Rueben] Peng!

[breathing heavily]


[Oli] Penguin!
[Rueben] She went down there.

Oh, sweetheart. [kisses]

Come on.

[dramatic music playing]

Penguin!


Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you.

We're about to head home.
There's no point in this weather.

Maybe she's at the beach.

It's getting dark, Snow.

Just five more minutes, please.

You're all gonna get sick.

Let's give him five more. Go! Go!

Penguin!

[Cam grunts]

Why did they do it?

Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone.


Magpies are territorial, mate.

Technically, this isn't Penguin's home.

It's theirs.


But we're her home.

I know, sweetheart. I know.



[thunder rumbles]

[thunder rumbles]

[footsteps receding]

[fireworks exploding]

Is it New Year's Eve?

No.

Then why are there fireworks?

I don't know.

'Cause sometimes

nice things just happen.

[fireworks continue exploding]

Are you mad at Noah?

'Cause anyone could've let her out.

I know.


[dogs barking in distance]

Peng!

Penguin!

[dogs continue barking]

Penguin!

Peng!

[dramatic music playing]

[birds squawking in distance]

You all right, Snow?

Do you think she's dead?

Jeez, Roo, no.

She's just scared.

Give her time to find her way home.
She knows where we are.

And Penguin's tough.
Isn't that right, Sammy?

Noah?

He's okay. He's justâ€¦




You've gotta let it go.

You're not to blame for Penguin,
and you're not to blame for my accident.

into something it's not. Just...

He thinks he is. Don't you, Noah?
[Cam] Oh, Sam.

Why do we have to talk about this?

Because I'm tired of not talking about it.

Please don't walk away.

You say I'm not to blame, Mum,
but you don't mean it.


You don't know anything, Dad.

Hey, hey, that's enough.
You don't see the way she looks at me.

Inside voices, mate...
Oh, shut up, Cam.

Please, Noah, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

Please. I need you to talk to me.

It's my fault we went up that tower.
It was my idea.

I'm the reason you broke your back.

You happy?

No, I'm not happy.

And sometimes I think
I'll never be happy again

but not because of you.

Then why don't you ever wanna talk
to me or be near me?

I don't know. I've made lots of mistakes.
[Noah] You hug Oli all the time.

You can't look at me!
I'm scared.

I'm just terrified that all this anger
will just come spewing out of me.

Not just at you, at all ofâ€¦ all of you.

Me too. You, Cam.


we'd never gone on that bloody roof!

But we went.

That was our decision.

Not yours.

You're not to blame

for any of it.

I promise.

It was just a piece of old, rotten wood.

I'm sorry I haven't been strong enough
to help you understand that.

Or help you through it.

I didn't think I was strong enough
to get through it myself.

But I am.

And I know that now.

[exhales deeply]

I'm here.

I'm your mum.

The same mum.

[inspirational music playing]


[birds chirping in distance]

[inspirational music continues]

Bye, Mum.
[kisses]

Bye, sweetie.


See ya.



You too.

[inspirational music continues]


[Cam] Finally.
Oh.

Okay then.

I give up.

What's this all about?


We're not spending another night staring
at Penguin's basket.

We're going out for fish and chips.

And I need a blindfold to go to the beach?

Well, who said anything about the beach?

Boys.

[Sam giggles] What are you up to?

Oh my gosh.
[Cam] We've got you.


[in unison] Ta-da!
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-la!


It is not just Gaye.
It's Gaye and Gaye's truck.

[Cam] Boys, let's go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Sam] Oh, hi, Bron.
Surprise?

Don't look at me.
No one tells me anything.

[Sam] What is going on?
One, two, three.


Your chariot awaits.

[Rueben] Bags having to go after Mum.
[chuckles]

We're going out

for fish and chips.

Only if you want to.

Okay.

Drive!

And drive, babies!

[Cam grunts]
[Bron laughs] We did it.

[Gaye] Oh, thank God.
[Sam] Oh, thank you, guys.

[Gaye] Over here?
[Kylie] Thank you. Yep, just here.

Oh, Mama.

[inhale and exhales deeply]

[inspirational music intensifies]

[Cam] Hey.
Hey.

That was pretty sneaky.


[exhales deeply]

Ask me that question.

Which question?

The one I told you never to ask me.

How are you?

[inhales deeply]


I'm better.

Thank you, Cam.



[inspirational music continues]

[bird squawking]
[seat belts unfastening]

Could be another one.



It's not.

[Rueben] That's Penguin.
Oh.

[Noah] It's Penguin!
[chuckles]

She's back! She's back.
Penguin, Penguin, Penguin!

Penguin!


[Penguin croaks softly]

[inspirational music continues]


[Sam] Peng.
[Noah] Peng.


[cheeping]
[giggles]

<i>And I know she's not the person
she wanted to be.</i>

<i>But to me,</i>

<i>she's much more than that.</i>

[inspirational music continues]



Where are you going?
[squawks]

Peng?
[squawks]


[croaks, squawks]

Peng?



What is it?

What are you up to?

Hey?
