April 22nd, 3:00 AM.

The ward doesn't have her.

I do.

By the time they've
figured out, we'll be gone.

The
ward doesn't have her.

I do.

By the time they've figured
it out, we'll be gone.

The patient has reached
non-rapid eye movement sleep

and is expressing a period of
emotional realism triggered

by an extreme psychologically
important event.

Darcy, stay where you
are in your dream.

What do you see?

What do you hear?

Nobody is going to hurt you.

But you have to let me in.

First
you're chosen.

Then you're used.

First you're chosen.

Then you're used.

First you're chosen.

Then you're used.

First you're chosen.

Then you're used.

What are you saying?

First
you're chosen.

What is it?

First
you're chosen.

Then you're used.

What do you see?

Darcy?

Stand up.

Just sit there.

It's OK.

That's going to be sore.

I'll take care.

Put your hands over here.

Lean your head
against the mirror.

You probably see that one hand
tied to the bed will be enough.

It didn't work, did it?

I can't help you if you
don't try to remember.

I'm scared.

Scared of what?

Of what I might become.

It's clear in
documented evidence

that these children sleep
walk because they are trying

to get back to their abuser.

You want to confront her.

You have to go where she is.

She's dead.

The breakthrough we
need lies in those walls,

not these, not serenity.

What she did to me in that
house... going back there.

And you really
think it will work?

It has to work.

If I see you regressing,
I'll get you out of there.

And I promise I'll
torch the place myself.

Let's get some sleep.

After a continuous night time
somnambulism therapy,

the patient has shown no signs
of the ability or desire

to express suppressed physical
and emotional memories...

continual self-abuse and
injury occur nightly.

Scheduled awakenings
have been applied

and the results are nil.

Three days ago, I was
notified by the county

that the patient's family
homestead is abandoned and left

to her by default as the
only living family member.

In spite of the
patients unwillingness

to accept recommended therapy,
the next course of action

is complete submersion in the
environment where.

<b>CUT HER OUT</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

You'll be fine.

I'm going to take a look.

What?

What is it?

Darcy?

Look, it's chips.

Do you know me?

You can pass me that bowl.

It's OK.

You can eat.

That's OK.

He can't... can't eat until
he's been given permission.

If you ate before she said
it, you'd get the whip.

Say that the she did...
put yourself in her skin.

She's standing over him
placing food in his bowl.

Before she leaves,
what does she say?

Don't make me say it.

I'm going to be sick.

Do you know the words?

Yes.

Then say them.

You... you are
hungry for beast.

But in my loving mercy, I
have left you this feast.

Come on in.

You're not ghost.

We're not going to hurt you.

Can you tell me your name?

Sam?

It's nice to meet you, Sam.

I'll leave the
door open for you.

We've arrived.

It's worse than I thought.

We found a feral child
named Sam living here

in deplorable conditions.

He appears malnourished,
but otherwise healthy.

His only communication has
been roaring and growling,

but has cognitive abilities
that is expressed by hearing

and following a command.

His name is Sam.

Is he your brother, Darcy?

Are there others?

How could I tell you about
things that I don't remember.

I have no idea about
him or anything else

we might find here.

He's just sitting in that
room.

What is that room?

I'm not going back in there.

I can't face this.

You can't pretend that
room doesn't exist.

Maybe that's the starting
point for your healing.

Maybe that's the place
where your pain lives.

But right now you need to
show that little boy that you

understand the place he's in.

I'll try to get
him to come out.

But if I do, then you have to
promise me you'll board it up.

Of course.

I lived in here too.

I know what happens
in this room.

It's wrong that you're in
here.

And it's wrong what
she did to you.

You think you're an animal.

But you're not.

I need you to come out with
me and let me guide you

to some place new...
a place where no one

whips you or starves you.

When you get ready, I'm
going to be right outside.

And I'm going to be
waiting for you.

OK?

Dr. Andrews.

You fucking idiot.

Excuse me?

Don't play dumb.

Bring her back.

And I mean right now.

If you do, maybe
you keep your job.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I'm on leave.

why are you on leave?

You want to talk about that?

It wasn't my fault.

save the world, Dr. Andrews.

They are crazy.

You're putting yourself and
this institution in danger

just because your kid died.

Tell me this... how
do we expect people

to get better when
all we do is drug them

and lock them in a cell?

you took a violent sociopath

to the ward without
permission.

And he nearly killed someone.

The world is not your
personal asylum, Ryan.

Now, I am asking you as your
colleague... bring her back.

Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

I'm on leave.

Don't smoke.

Mother wouldn't like that.

She's dead.

You can do anything you like.

Like get well... something else
your mother wouldn't like.

Sam's not ready.

He doesn't trust us.

She was manipulative like
that... would give a command

and then beat you
when you obey.

Let him stay.

The last thing we should do
is force anything on him.

We sit back.

And we let him figure
out how to respond to us.

No.

No, we have to get
him out of here.

We have to tell
the authorities.

The only way this works
is if you get well.

Remember, we talked about
this.

Otherwise, they take
you... they drug you up.

They throw you back
in the water.

I can't look at him.

I've spent years trying to
kill that part of myself.

And now it sits
right in front of me.

Every breath reminding
me it will never die.

You're a kid just like Sam.

But he doesn't have
to fight alone.

He has us.

You save Sam, you save
yourself, essentially.

But I need you
in there with me.

I can't... I won't be able to
sleep without you.

Of course.

Go to sleep.

Five hours
of non-compliance.

The subject has emerged
from the pen.

The source of his
security is unknown.

Don't wake him.

This is going to work.

Today we start.

We start in the house...
get some more rest.

You awake?

Kind of.

Two things I'm
thankful for... Sam.

What's the second?

You trusting me
not to sleepwalk.

Like I said before,
I'm glad you're just

trying to get back home.

You're here now.

You don't need them.

Once upon a time,
there was a master

who had a horse who had been a
faithful and loyal servant.

But soon the beast
turned on his master

and he became
disobedient and weak.

He's still not talking.

But he brought me some
paper and his black crayon

and just sat down
and started drawing.

That's good.

How are you?

I am not looking back.

It's about today.
Am good.

It's because of you
he's getting better.

Is black your
favorite color too?

How am I going to color
with you if there is just

one black crayon?

Problem solved.

Yeah?

We're getting my start from the
tree house of all tree houses.

My first observation

of Sam was, he has the
same brown eyes as Rodney.

I can't believe it's
been four years.

Maybe it's just my second
chance to... I don't know.

Big plans for the
back yard?

Dog, he thinks he's the dog.

Maybe he just wants
to name the dog Sam.

Before I got back here, did
you talk to him about mother?

Did you tell him that she
treated you like an animal too?

Why would I scare
him like that?

Just fucking say it.

I'm just some project to you.

I'm here because I love you.

I am here for you in this
house to find your pain.

There is no you
and me... just you.

Because of
some crazy title?

Stop.
Stop.

What if I got better?

That's why we're here.

Would you love me then?

It would definitely
be easier, yes.

Tomorrow night we
start hypnosis.

This picture... this
is our starting point.

You can be able to sleep
alone here tonight.

You know why?

I brought you one of my
shirts.

Would you like to wear it?

Our son used to wear
my shirts to sleep in.

He said it made him feel
safe.

He'd be about your age now.

Am glad you found yourself.

You know what?

We're going to get your
lights in here fixed soon.

OK?

Get some sleep.

Sam, have you ever
used a spoon before?

Let's try it.

Let me see your hand.

Your going to grab it just
like that... real tight.

All right, we'll go in...
got to get to the bottom.

That's where the milk is...
see?

A little bite... a little
bite... not too big.

There you go.
See the milk?

We then go in...
lift up... perfect.

That's right.

All the way to the
bottom... get that milk.

That's a big bite.

See?

I told you it was a big bite.

I'd do a little less than
that.

And, Sam, make sure you drink
the milk when you finish.

It's the best part.

More.

I've got some work to do.

Good job, Sam.

What's happening?

You were touching things.

Mhm.

You felt the sensation
of that on your lips.

It was metal mixed with
blood.

What was in your
mouth last night?

And you made her put
that bit in your mouth.

She would just stick
it in and hold my nose

and caress my hands.

Talk to mother now...
not the little girl.

Talk to mom.

I didn't mean to
bite you, mother.

But you just... you
kept pushing it in.

Tell her how much you hate
her.

Don't you talk to me that
way.

Fiends...
they are coming.

Let them out.

My baby.

My baby.

You can't hurt my
baby that way.

And I trained you so well.

The weak one get it the
worst.

But it's for their own good.

They survive.

They become the master.

What does that mean?

Or is it you?

What did you do to me?

It's all right.

You came so far just now.

What's coming out is exactly
what I knew we could find here.

Don't tell me... don't
tell me... not one

word of what I just said.

It's OK.

Here.

After the initial
hypnosis session.

There's great evidence MPD.

The patient speaks in two
distinct personalities.

I don't have time to play
hangman right now, partner.

I got to go to town
and get supplies.

We have a lot of work
to do around here.

I need you to be
man of the house.

You guys will be OK without
me.

Keep around Darcy.

I made this for you
in case you got hungry.

Thank you.

Don't try to do too
much around here, OK?

Maybe you and Sam can work
on the tree house.

That sound good?

OK.

Yeah, I know you're here.

Sam, you know the
rules... her rules.

Remember the story about the
disobedient horse wandering

in the woods sad because
his monster didn't want him?

He began to enjoy his
freedom.

He felt wild and alive.

But soon he began to
feel terribly lonely.

And he knew that he had no
one to take care of him.

And what he didn't know
was that deep in the woods

a man was drawing a dark
plan.

He had set a trap for
the little horse...

made of flowers
and sweet grass.

Hey, Sam.

What you doing?

Can I see it?

You didn't go in the
woods today did you, Sam?

No.

And you didn't
board up with Ken.

Got something for you.

Open.

Take one out.

See?

Now we have a whole
crayon each.

You like that?

Do you know anything
about electrical wiring?

Because I got to take
care of some of the parts.

Then we can get that light
in the room fixed, OK?

Hey, Sam, I need you
to do me a favor.

Go tell Darcy to
kill the breaker.

Can you do that for me?

Kill the breaker.

R- E-A-K-E-R... perfect.

Are we clear?

Dammit!

Why didn't you
kill the breaker?

What are you talking about?

I just got electrocuted.

Sam, did you tell her
to kill the breaker?

He didn't tell
me anything, Ryan.

He doesn't talk.

I saw him write it down,
Darcy.

Let us see your hands.

There's no need
to see my hands.

Next time, you do
what I tell you, OK?

Let go of him.

Why would you do that?

And you see why you
have to listen to mom.

Disobedience gets you hurt.

And the only way to stay
safe is to stay close to me.

Don't turn away from me, Sam.

Let me protect you from her.

And she'll haunt your
dreams like she does mine.

a fresh wound on Sam's back

in the shape of a dark
circle.

Prior to that, I found
a ringing music box.

I don't want to see
that side of you again.

It won't happen again.

And what you did today is
not going to help Sam heal.

I'll apologize to
him when I see him.

If you don't mind, I
have some work to do.

And I would like some space.

You're not telling him to
kill the breaker

and running into the woods.

That's him testing me.

I can't let him think
he's in control.

You want to break
us just like she did...

make us feel beneath you.

Sam and I are your equal, right?

I will not let you control us.

Look, I'm trying to keep you
both from harming yourselves.

Children need boundaries.

Fuck off.

Sam!

Sam!

Where are you?

Sam.

Where are you?

Ryan.

Ryan, wake up.

Wake up. I can't find him.

Sam, he wasn't in his room.

I can't find him.

He's not in his room.

Maybe he went outside.

OK.

OK, I'll go look.

I'll look.

Sam?

How did you get in here?

How did you get in here, bub?

Sam, I'm sorry I yelled at
you.

It wasn't your fault. You don't
need to be in this room.

Why don't you come with me?

Let's get you cleaned
up, all right?

All right.

Right.

I think it's the perfect day
to start on Sam's hideaway.

There's no place for Sam
to hide... not from her.

There's no one here
to hide from, Sam.

So you don't have
to go on that road.

You'll have your own place.

Isn't that what you want?

She can't make me come there.

You said so, right?

Sam, who did this to you?

Was it Darcy?

Was it mother?

There is no mother.

Running.

I was running in the
woods looking for Sam.

And she was chasing me.

My mother... she didn't... she
didn't want me to give to you.

I found him in a pen.

You did?

Thank god.

How did you get
in there, Darcy?

What do you mean?

I mean, the boards
were taken down.

And they were put back up.

He was locked in there.

Someone put him in there.

It wasn't me.

It was her.

And she's not...
she's not dead, Ryan.

He just talked to me.

What did he tell you?

Tell me what?

Anything.

Yes, he did.

What did he say?

He said, there is no mother.

Sam.

Ryan told me you spoke to
him.

Did you say something to
Ryan.

He doesn't live in our skin.

You see, he wants
to fix our heart

when he doesn't understand
our heart is not broken.

It never worked
right from the start.

But that's our secret, OK.

All we have to do is act.

Act like we're better and
then we can leave this place.

I bet you worked up
quite an appetite?

Yes.

Yes, I did.

Sam, is there anything
I can say or do

to help you get the words
out?

It's lunchtime, guys.

He's getting better.

Now I am in the dark.

Now I am in the room.

What room?

The pen?

Yes.

Are you...

There's someone.

Ask them who they are.

Who are you?

It's Darcy.

Hi, Darcy.

Who was I just talking to?

I don't know.

Who else is in there with
you?

Don't do that.

Don't do that.

She's going to hear you.

Stop it.

Darcy.

You never listen to mother!

That's why we're here.

I love you!

I love you!

God.

What happened?

What did I do?

It's OK.

You didn't do anything.

It was my fault.

Are you sure?

Yeah, positive.

You did great.

We just had a breakthrough.

Really?

Yeah. Really.

Yeah. I'm proud of you.

Why don't you get
rid of the meds.

No pills?

No.

No, you're good.

Let me finish up some work,
OK?

OK.

What is it, Sam?

Sam?

What happened?

What did you dream?

Did you do anything?
Are you hurt?

Sam.

What's wrong?

I don't know.

It's blood.

Why is his towel bloody?

Sam, go to the bathroom.

Why did you use that towel?

Didn't you see the blood on
it?

Spavine.

Don't you ever call me that?

That's your name, isn't it?

You're supposed to
be looking after me.

You don't know
anything about her.

Then tell me about her.

There was another just like
me.

But no more.

Spavine died in that pen.

Don't you ever let that
name come from your lips.

I can't help you if you
keep secrets from me.

This is my
darkness... not yours.

This belongs to Sam and I.
We carry that name.

No.

Sam doesn't have your wounds.

You want him to be like you.

He's not.

You don't know what he feels.

I do.

Sam and I... we walked
through that hell.

And you... you just write
about it in your little book.

Spavine, she was
my sister, Ryan.

Sam.

Sam.

Why is he throwing up worms?

It's common in
the country, Ryan.

Kids get worms.

You go to the pharmacy.

They'll know what he needs.

No. I need to take him to a clinic
so they can take a look at him.

No, you go.

We'll be fine.

Just go.

Baby, what did mom tell you
about becoming an animal.

Animals have worms,
Sam... not little boys.

You are not one of them.

And I am not either.

Ryan put that thought in you.

And you have to
fight against it.

Did you know that animals
are incapable of love?

It's false when they
show you affection.

When I tell you I love you,
it's because I'm not an animal.

I am your mother.

Hey Sam.

No, no games.

I need to ask you some
things.

What does that mean to you?

She had other children.

Sam has shown me the remains
that was other children.

The causes of death unknown.

My immediate concern is Darcy
has a neurotic disorder that's

causing her to succumb to
the personality of mother.

She is clearly unaware
that this alter ego exists.

The mother exists.

And is slowly becoming... it's
becoming a dominant personality.

When mother...

Will you leave us alone?

Do you hear me, mother?

We're not your beasts.

Our love is stronger than
your leather ties and whips.

No.

There is no reason for such
an anatomic abnormality.

The child is severely
undersized for the pictures.

It appears she has
two sets of teeth...

the straining harness
used on her body

to mobilize her... big, white
callous... heavy black bruising

on the buttocks.

There are no pictures of the
child crying in all the time

that she's seen.

It's producing pleasures
when submersed in water.

It seems cheap.

Like she feels sensations
associated with water.

That's it. Water.

Where did this go wrong?

Look, you were right.

This is out of my control.

I'm going to sedate her
and bring her back.


Glad you see you
came to your senses

but the damage
has already been done.

I used to be just like you.

I thought I could
cure them all.

Will you just shut the fuck
up?

All right, listen,
I need a favor.


I don't know where she is.

And she has my gun.



What's your emergency?

Hi, this is Doctor
Ryan Andrews.

And I've got a patient of mine
here at... give just one second.

Who are you talking to?

Sir?

Just checking my voice-mail.

what is your location?

Sir?

Why do you
have a knife, Darcy?

I had to cut her out.

I need to take Sam to town.
It's the worms.

I think it's serious.

He belongs to me.

He's your son, isn't
he?

Yes.

Who am I talking to right
now?

Spavine.

That's what I thought.

There is no mother, is there?

Of course there is.

Sam, come to mother.

Stay right there, Sam.

Sam, you don't
have to go with her.

You have been a bad boy.

It's time for you
to go into the pen.

And don't worry.

You have been a bad boy too.

And you are next.

Where are you?

I know you're here.

I can smell you...
taste you in the air.

I want you to put
the gun down, OK?

It's OK.

Just put the gun
down, that's enough.

You're safe with me, OK?

OK, I will protect you.

You will?

Yes.

Now, please put the gun down.

Sam, did Darcy do these
horrible things to you?

Is someone else here?

Is mother here?

Mother... Spavine.

OK, come on.

OK, let's go.

I want you to wait
right here buddy.

I need you to wait right
here, OK... be right back.

Sam!

Let's tell a new story.

This one is about a baby
horse who was warned

not to go into the woods.

His mother warned him to
the beware of the wolf who

lived there and wanted
nothing more than to make

a meal of her little fawn.

But her little horse was too
curious for his own good.

He disobeyed.

Sam!

Sam?

Sam, come here.

Come here.

Sam.
Let's go.
