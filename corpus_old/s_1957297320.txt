Tate, don't leave town.

Will do, Sheriff.

I'll just be in the cafe
getting something to eat.

Just don't leave town till I say so.

Some of you carry him over to
the jail cell to bleed out.

We have beef stew or
chicken and noodles.

Beef and biscuits?

Coffee?

Yeah.

Hey, I know who you are.

You're the one who just killed The Kid.

Killing didn't seem to
ruin your appetite none.

I guess you do a lot of
that, don't you, Tate Butler?

Don't bother my customers, Wilson.

You might scare him off.

Gunfighters don't get
scared off by nothing,

do they, Tate Butler?

Yeah, yeah, you're a tough guy.

You don't have to talk to him

if you don't want to, mister.

He's just a nosy old gossip.

Now, that's not a nice thing to say

about one of your regular customers.

That's all
right, miss. Thank you.

You got nice manners.

You from back East?

Indiana.

They don't got
no gunfighters in Indiana.

Is that why you out here.

I'm out here for the same
reason everybody else is.

Gold?

Adventure.

Adventure? Well, you got
lots of that, didn't you?

It's a real adventure when
everybody's trying to kill ya.

Katherine, I saw you out there earlier.

You can't protect him
from behind a barrel.

And even if you could this time,

there's always gonna be another gunfighter

trying to kill him.

So?

Stay away from Tate.

He's no good.

I'm a grown woman and
I'll do what I want.

I can't just stand by and
watch you make a mistake.

How could a father just let
his only daughter get hurt

without saying something?

Well, you said
your piece now leave.

You lost the right to be
my father a long time ago

when you left my mother.

You won't be Tate Butler's wife.

You'll be his widow.

I hate to admit it, Katie dear,

but he might be right.

Coffee, Sheriff?

That would be lovely, darlin'.

Pie?

That does look good.

You talked me into it.

He shot first.

I know. You're safe.

The Kid had a $200 bounty
on his head, dead or alive

so you'll be collecting some money.

Oh, that's lucky.

I'll sell his horse, his saddle,

and his personal items
to pay the undertaker

but then you need to get out of town.

I can't be having gunfights
in the middle of Main Street.

And he may have family coming after you.

Yeah, it wouldn't be the
first time. I understand.

You're getting slow. He beat ya.

But his aim was bad.

Well, you won't last long

now that you're slowing down.

You just got lucky this time.

Why don't you go home?

Wherever that is.

Family'll hide ya.

Dad died,
Mom remarried, and I left.

Well, why don't you find religion?

Me?

Religion? That's a good one.

Hey, there's a church over in Riverton.

It's got a new pastor.

Says he wants to tame the West.

Brice Smith is the new pastor's name

and he's let it be known

that he wants to help people like you.

Seems to me that may be
just what you're looking for.

Yeah. Why don't you go find religion?

Or Mexico?

I don't care which one.

Fine.

I'll have your reward
money tomorrow afternoon

but then you need to leave town

and leave Katherine alone.

Thanks.

Hey.

Hmm?

You want something else?

No. What I want I can't have.

What?

No, not that. Oh God.

Oh.

God all I've got is beans.

Ah.

You can eat that or I'll
take you down to the river

and we can get you some of that
new green grass if you want.

It's up to you.

All I know is that if I want
Katie, I've gotta fix this.

She deserves better.

Say that guy, Wilson,

he was talking about a preacher,

same name as my baby brother,
helping guys like me.

You think my baby
brother might've followed me

all the way out here?

No, I don't think I'm worth
following out here either.

No, I don't think I talk too much.

All I know is that you and I regardless

are gonna have to go to
Riverton if I want the girl.

Say, I wonder...

I wonder if my baby brother
would even remember anything.

I hope so because his father
was a miserable old bastard.

You talking to yourself again, Tate?

I have to, nobody else
listens to me anymore,

not even Dusty.

That was a close one today.

Yeah, I'm getting too
old for this nonsense.

You and me both.

I worry about you?

So when can we stop this sneaking around?

Oh, well, probably just as soon

as I'm done killing 'em all.

No, seriously.

I don't know.

We could run away to California.

Hmm.

Yeah, we could, but somebody
there would probably

recognize me and it would
just start all over again.

Speaking of starting all over again.

Ouch!

I wish you didn't have to
wear that gun all the time.

Yeah. You and me both.

How 'bout I take it off for you?

You awake?

Oh.

Well, I am now.

Couldn't really sleep.

I kept wishing that things were different.

Well, they're not.

Couldn't you just stay
out here for a little while?

And come back into town
like nothing happened.

Maybe even get a job.

All those gunfighters will
have to leave eventually.

I was asked to leave.

He didn't mean it.

Oh, yes he did.

And I can't blame him.

That was the third gunfight
on Main Street this month.

Then what are we gonna do?

Well, I could go to Riverton,

wait my time out there,

and wait until I hear all
the gunfighters have left.

Then...

Then what?

Well, there's a preacher in Riverton,

same name as my baby brother.

So I've gotta check that out.

Preacher?

You're related to a preacher?

It's possible.

You know, my mother was
a God-fearing woman.

Maybe she brought up my
brother in the faith.

Why didn't none of
that ever rub off on you?

Oh, I tried it.

I prayed every night that my
stepfather'd stop beating me.

When it didn't work,

I gave up on praying and I left.

Mm.

Say, when can I see you again?

I'll try and sneak away from the store.

Mama gets real tired nowadays.

It's hard for me to leave her.

Can I buy ya lunch at the cafe

once you get all cleaned up?

Not with Wilson
hanging out there all the time.

Hm. Maybe I'll just
have to shoot him too.

No, I'm just kidding.

Living a Christian life
is harder than it looks.

All around us are temptations

that can keep us from our goals.

Directly after today's service

we're going to have a
celebration of baptism

down at the river where our new members

will receive their shield of protection

and all are welcome to attend.

The good book tells us
how God wants us to live.

It's not a suggestion

but a guide to find eternal salvation

which is the only way to
achieve true happiness.

The 10 Commandments keep it simple for us.

Love they neighbor.

Don't cheat on your wife.

Don't kill.

Love God.

Could it be any clearer than that?

We strive to follow

but God provides forgiveness
for those who fall short.

God loves us because we are his children

and parents love their
children unconditionally

even when they do something wrong.

That is the good news for today.

Now, let us stand and sing
our praises to the Lord.

Lucy, what hymn are we going sing today?

Well, since we don't have any hymnals

how about "Shall We Gather by the River"?

Everyone knows that.

Now let's follow me down
to the river as we sing.

â™ª Shall we gather at the river â™ª

â™ª Where bright angel's feet have trod â™ª

â™ª With its crystal tide forever â™ª

â™ª Flowing by the throne of God â™ª

This must be the place.

Wonder if I should wait
until the music stops

or if I should just go in.

I'm looking for a sign, Dusty.

Oh, well, there's my sign.

Spelled the correct way and...

Why hello.

Hello.

Would you like to join us?

I guess.

Everyone's out back by the river.

There's a baptism today.

Come with me.

All right.

Come on, Dusty.

I think you're too big to baptize.

In the name of the father

and the son, and the holy ghost.

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

Hallelujah!

Tate.

Long time, little brother.

12 years.

Honey, would you like a towel?

No that's why God created
hot, dry breezes.

I need to go finish the Lord's work.

So you're Tate.

That was quite an entrance you caused.

I was trying to sneak in unnoticed.

It didn't work.

I'm your sister-in-law Lucy.

Oh. Oh pleasure to meet you.

When Mama was ill,

I took care of her

and she made me promise I'd find you.

You broke her heart when you left.

You sold the place?

I had to.

I couldn't take care of it all by myself.

Yeah, of course.

I didn't get much for it.

And I used the money to go to college.

There's no inheritance for you.

I didn't expect any.

I'm just, I'm glad you got some
decent schooling out of it.

I was worried you'd be mad.

It was originally your father's place.

When I saw your name in one of those

"Guides to Gunfighters
of the Wild West" books,

I knew it had to be you

and I could keep my promise to Mama.

Well, I'm glad you did.

I always wondered what
happened after I left.

I wasn't surprised you
went down the wrong path.

Yeah. About that.

Those books are just crap.

I'm not a gunfighter.

I don't go looking for gunfights.

They come looking for me.

Call themselves shootists,

or, you know, Caballeros, whatever.

They're all just morons and murderers,

just trying to kill me to
make a name for themselves.

They don't know you're here.

Everyone thinks you're my brother.

Yeah, just give it
some time. It'll happen.

Morning, Reverend.

Marshall, this is my brother Tate.

Tate this our sheriff.

He used to be a federal marshal

before he moved to our town.

Yeah, I heard your brother was in town.

That's why I'm here.

I know who you are, Tate Butler.

I'm just here to visit my brother.

That's good.

I don't want any trouble in my town.

And Mr. Butler, trouble
follows you wherever you go.

I'll be leaving soon.

Good.

We got enough of your
kind around here already.

I don't like you
trying to run my brother

out of town, Marshall.

He's done nothing.

Not yet,

but he attracts gunfighters

and I don't need that kind in my town.

You've got too many of 'em

rehabilitating around here as it is.

As Christians, we must do God's bidding

and help those unable to help themselves.

What would Jesus do?

That's got a good ring to it.

Marshall.

Dinner's ready.

We'll be right there.

That's not very neighborly, Marshall.

Well, my job's to protect the town

not to be neighborly.

You know, Brice,

I'd like to help your brother if I could

but I can't and protect
the town at the same time.

Marshall.

So does Dusty like it here?

Oh, I suppose so.

We do a lotta camping, so,

well, that's a nice change of pace.

Tate's been running
from the young guns too.

That's terrible.

Brice's converts have the same problem.

It's like you just can't
give up gun fighting.

Yeah, I'd like to settle
down and find a place

but they'd just find me again.

Well, no one knows you're here.

Well, the marshal recognized him

and that's why he was here earlier.

We need to tell everyone he's
Tate Smith, your brother.

Yeah, it might be a
little late for that.

Well, it's never too late for prayer.

Uh...

I'd like something a
little bit more tangible.

Tate could buy a place
here, settle down near us.

I'd like to

but your Marshall Pearson
just asked me to leave.

He asked Tate Butler to leave.

Tate Butler lives in Hayward.

Tate Smith lives here in Riverton.

I am not going to lie for him, Lucy.

You could buy the Jensen's place

on the outskirts of town
under the name Tate Smith.

They wanna move back East
and you can get it for cheap.

How cheap?

150 or less.

Huh.

You go back to Hayward

and make everyone think you live there

and I'll get you that ranch.

Yah!

Yah!

So I was thinking about what Lucy is doing

and I'm thinking it just might work.

Does he ever answer you?

Dusty is not a big talker.

He's more of a listener.

I'm so glad you're back.

So what happened?

I found my baby brother.

Really?
Yeah.

He looks like Mama and he's married.

Well, what's she like?

Oh, she's a strong girl.

Perfect for him.

I am a little worried
that they're not prepared

for how hard life is out here,

but she is helping me buy a ranch.

Well, that's great.

Yeah.

So I was thinking we could
settle down out here.

I could call myself Tate Smith

and we could run some
cattle and grow a garden.

We?
Mm-hm, I'm asking, Katie.

Father would never let
me marry a gunfighter.

Well, Tate Smith is a rancher.

You can't fool Father.

I'm gonna change that.

I know.

You know, I never asked for this life.

That book turned me
into something I ain't.

I've just been defending myself.

I know.

And sometimes, well,
sometimes I've thought to myself

the only way I was gonna get it to stop

was when I got killed.

No, not like that!

I like the name change,
but it might not be enough.

I could grow a beard.

Hm. Come by the store
tomorrow.

We'll talk more about it.

All right, I won't
have much time though.

Got some nice brown bread in.

Ooh.

Woman in town makes it for me.

It'll go good with all those
beans you eat.

Besides Mother said she wanted
to start taking long naps

in the afternoons from now on.

Well, okay.

Don't worry about Father.

He's only doing what he thinks he has to

to make up for all those
years he hurt Mama.

Yeah, we're all trying
to make up for something.

I brought you some soap.

Take a bath in the river for me?

What makes you think
I have time for this?

Don't you love me the way I am?

I like the clean version better.

Bath first.

Oh.

Hey!

Hey, Butler.

Hey, I'm faster than you, old man.

Hey! You hearing me?

Said I'm faster than you.

I got no problem with you, stranger.

Faster than you, old man.

Uh huh.

Hey!

Stop right there.

Nothing good

can come from this, buddy.

I ain't your buddy.

I'm just saying I'm faster than you.

Yeah, you probably are.

Let's not fight about it, huh?

You're yellow.

I'm gonna show to everyone
here that I'm faster than you.

Who cares who's faster.

I don't.

I do.

We all care.

Not so fast, ladies.

Everyone clear outta here

'cause there's gonna be a fight

and you better get ready now.

Oh, now be careful, huh?

Want a countdown?

Do I want a countdown?

I don't wanna do this.

One.

Two.

Three.

Lucky again, Tate.

Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.

Well, I couldn't risk it.

Katherine would never forgive me

if I let anything happen to you.

Father.

Got these two for you.

What did they do?

Well, Sheriff.

Oh, the Slim Gang.

Yeah.

You two, take 'em to jail.

Come on, move!

That was too close.

Well, the only thing that matters

is making it out alive.

Slim here was wanted

so you'll be collecting another bounty.

Ha! You shot her.

But it's my job.

I can't collect the bounty.

We'll just call it a, an
early wedding present.

What?

Besides once someone's dead

what difference does it make

what direction the bullet came from?

Thank you.

Well, it looks like I won't
need to call the undertaker.

If her aim was better, I'd
be burying the two of ya.

Need to be careful, Tate.

Oh, and when you kill someone,

you take their soul some say.

Now you've gotta battle their demons too.

But you're
the one who killed her.

I know.

Get out of here.

Can I buy you a meal?

I wish I could.

I gotta get back to Mother.

Not here.

Looks like you got lucky once again.

You're gonna live to see another day

thanks to your friend.

I don't know why they wrote
all them books about you.

You don't seem all that fast to me.

When I was in my prime,
I was faster than you.

You were never a fast draw, Wilson.

And you never had a prime.

So shut up and stop
bothering my customers.

I'm just speaking my mind, missy.

Ain't a man allowed to do that?

This may come as a rude awakening,

but I'm not a gunfighter.

All those stories in
that book are made up.

The author made them up to sell books

and he used my name because
he liked the way it sounded.

Well, just how much did they pay you

for all them made up stories about you?

Nothin'.

Nothin'?

Well, you sound to me like you got took.

Drink to that.

Whoa!

I see the water was cold.

Ain't it rude to sneak up on a man

when his ammo is wet?

Throw me that towel.

Thanks.

I just got back from Riverton.

You remember that preacher
Wilson was going on about?

Turns out he's my baby brother.

So I'm planning on
buying a place down there

and settling down.

Well, that's good.

I suppose you're gonna try
and take Katherine with ya.

I'm gonna ask.

Well, I'm not one to give advice

on marriage since I
botched it with her mother,

but I hope for Katherine's sake,

she's strong enough to turn you down.

Here's your money.

Put it in the saddlebag.

Throw me those pants, would ya?

I know too much about your kind of life

to want that for her.

She'd be better off a spinster.

I am not a gunfighter.

I know you're not a gunfighter.

You're too slow to be a gunfighter.

We saved your butt this time

but you may not be so lucky next time.

And who asks someone to marry into that?

Women don't wanna think
you might not come home.

Katherine's mother asked me to quit once.

When I didn't,

well, you know the rest.

I do. I've heard all about it.

And I am done with that.

Throw me that shirt.

But are the other
gunfighters done with you?

They won't be done with you, son,

till you're dead and six feet under.

So you better watch your back.

Here, Mother, let me help you with that.

I don't need no help.

I can still handle things
around here myself.

I might be old, but I'm
not dead yet, Katie dear.

Mother, I don't like to
hear you talk like that.

Well, it's the truth.

Most people, my age are already dead.

But do we have to talk
about it all the time?

Well, we do so that
you'll know what to do.

But when it happens, I'll
call the undertaker, all right?

But do you know what dress
I want to be buried in?

I've got the plot next to your grandmother

reserved for me.

There's one there for you too

and a husband, if you ever get one.

And I hope to God it's
not that Tate Butler.

Oh mother!

You need to know these things.

Well, now I do.

And you need to know
how to order merchandise

for the store.

Fine, okay.

This is how the store is run.

I'll learn it.

You wouldn't have to do it all alone

if you had a man in your life.

Like I said, I can learn it.

You don't need that
bad boy in your life.

You need someone who will help you.

Don't you go making
that same mistake I did.

You think we oughta
risk going to see Katie

one more time?

I never really properly proposed to her.

I should do that,

you know, with a gold ring
and get down on one knee

and all that.

I mean a proper proposal.

That's, that's the way to do it.

Oh, man.

You think I can pull this off?

Course with that reward money,

could buy a real nice ring
with that, couldn't I?

Do I go get the ring
or do I go see my girl?

Thanks. That helps a lot.

So I was wondering

if you would help me pick
out a ring for Katherine.

I would love to help.

Oh, thank you.

I need a ring, right,
for a proper proposal?

I mean, did Brice have a ring for you?

I have your mother's ring.

My, my mother had a ring?

Apparently yes.

It must be from Brice's father.

My father never had anything
but debt to his name.

I'm sorry.

I know you didn't like
your stepfather much.

Yah, it's ancient history

'cause I'm about to
own my own home, right?

That's right.

I registered the deed yesterday
under the name Tate Smith.

You registered the deed?

I can move in?

Today if you like.

Dusty!

Dusty, we've got our own home.

Oh, that's wonderful.

Now Katie and I can start a family.

It'll be real nice having
a family around here.

We wanna have a baby too.

I just hope Katie says yes.

You're a good man.

Of course she'll say yes.

Besides there's not much else
to choose from around here.

Wait, so I get the girl
because the options are bad?

Brother. It's good to see you.

I'm preparing a special sermon on Sunday

and you should be there.

I thought I would address
loving thy neighbor

even though we're all different, you know,

God's lost sheep and all that.

I'm preparing the congregation
for when you move in.

So I should wait a few weeks

until you prepared 'em for me.

No, you should be at
the church every Sunday

showing God your commitment

by putting your butt on the bench.

Yeah, I don't know how to
break this to you, brother,

but I'm not much of a churchgoer.

Well, now you are.

Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has.

God is the one who
makes all things possible

and you must show him your devotion.

Without him in your life,

your life is worthless.

Uh-

Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has-

Tate must ask for
forgiveness for his sins.

If he repents, our loving
merciful God will grant it.

If you believe and are
baptized, then you are saved.

And that is your good news, brother.

Yeah.

Even though you've
taken the lives of others,

God will forgive you.

You know, I really wasn't
worried too much about that.

It was self-defense.

Turn all your worries over to Christ.

Yeah, I'm gonna.

I'm gonna go ahead and go
take a look in the new place.

Thank you for all you've done

and I might see on Sunday, Pastor.

It's God's will.

Yeah, till Sunday.

You plan on staying for supper?

Thanks.

What was all that God forgiveness stuff

you were giving Tate?

Well, he's killed many men

and he has to make himself
right with the Lord.

I'm with him.

I think the Lord understands self-defense.

Well, yes, but-

But you're his brother.

He wants to start a new
life with his girlfriend.

That's wonderful but-

But, you need to be his
brother and not his pastor.

You may have found religion

but you have not found compassion.

God, if you're listening,

please let me have a baby before them.

Ladies.

Guess not.

There it is.

That's home for now.

Hopefully forever, huh?

Let's go take a look. Yeah.

Boy, does it have promise, huh?

All right.

Well.

Yeah.

Well, this is it, Dusty.

This is great!

Let's go check out that barn.

Well, I promised you a barn, Dusty.

This is home.

What's the matter with you people?

Why can't you accept that we've repented

and changed our ways?

God has forgiven us.

Why can't you?

Come and set with me?

Come and set with me now.

Move over.

Rejoice for the day that
the Lord has given us today.

Lucy, "Amazing Grace".

â™ª Amazing grace â™ª

â™ª How sweet the sound â™ª

You had this whole section to yourself.

Yeah well, I guess I look
like I've got something

they might catch.

Yeah, well, they'll come around

once their ivory towers start to crumble.

Yeah. I don't mind.

Don't worry about it.

Did you get the ring?

There's one over at the general store.

It's got an emerald and two diamonds.

I told the owner you'd be over
to take a look at it for me.

I'll go tomorrow.

I see you
didn't take my warning.

Marshall. How's Linda?

She's good.

She just left to go home and start supper.

If you hurry, you can catch up to her.

Yeah, I think I'll stick around here

and listen to you try to run
my brother-in-law outta town.

No. I think it more like
a little friendly advice.

It's too late for that.

I've bought a place and
I plan on settling down.

You know, you're putting
the town's folk in danger.

They're in no danger from me.

Good.

And when your friends come
around looking to kill you,

I'll send them out to your ranch.

Nice of you to put my life in danger.

Just doing my job.

Can't you find a way
to protect Tate too?

You know, if I could
protect him, I would.

That's all right. I'll handle it.

Yeah, but can Katherine?

Have you seen her shotgun?

I love you too, Tate.

Good morning, Mrs. Cleveland.

Good morning.

How can I help you?

I wanted to make a Sunday
dress for my daughter.

Oh, well we've got a nice
selection of gingham right here.

Your mother's not here today?

She has trouble sleeping.

Takes her a while to get
going in the mornings.

She'll be in soon.

All old people have those problems.

She was going to order
some pink bolts for me.

Have they come in yet?

There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

Let me check the ledger
to see what was ordered

and what came in.

There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

Well, this one's not bad.

It could work.

How long before more bolts come in?

Could be a month or more.

Well, this will have to do.

Can you put it on our account?

Of course.

And send it to our house?

Absolutely.

Mother, did you order any pink fabric

for Mrs. Cleveland recently?

Maybe I did.

Maybe I did.

Or maybe I forgot.

Mother, you don't look well.

Should I go get the doctor?

Doctors are for sick people.

I'm just a little
confused about our stock.

Mother!

How did you know?

You know how word gets around.

I'm so glad you're here.

I don't know what I should do.

Marry me.

What?

Let me take care of you.

Well, if it's too soon,

I can wait.

I don't know what I should
do about anything anymore

and I'm scared.

Father said he'd help
me out with the store

until I can sort things out.

Where are the candied apricots?

Uh, right here

on the middle shelf.

Oh, need to order more.
That's it for these.

Okay. Thanks.

That'll be two bits please.

It's good for breakfast.

Thank you, ma'am.

Oh and I need a pound
of six penny nails.

You've got it, Katie.

Pardon me, miss.

I'll be right with you.

Take your time. I'm in no rush.

Tate!

Could you take these things
to their wagon for them, Pops?

Sure.

Thanks, Pops.

Looks like you fellas

are gonna be doing some whooping.

We are.
Yes, we are.

Thank you kindly.

What is going on in here?

Pops is helping me stock the shelves.

I never thought I'd see the day.

How long can you stay?

As long as you need me to stay.

It's not good for you

to be hanging out here, Tate Butler.

Keep moving.

You still the sheriff?

My deputy's handling
the day-to-day duties

but it's still my jurisdiction.

Hmm.

Well, the apron's a good look.

We need a nanny, I'll
well, I'll send for you.

You should be leaving now, Tate.

You know anyone who
wants to buy a store?

So you decided to leave now, just now?

If Tate can't stay, why should I?

Well, this town depends on the store

and you're the only one
that knows how to run it.

Pops is not the best shopkeeper.

He's more of the run folks
out of town type person.

Yeah, I noticed.

Now, Katie, you know all I
want is what's best for you.

I just wanna help.

Well, then get that order
on the counter ready for me.

Give me that ring, Tate Butler.

Oh, don't worry, I'll clean it up.

Uh, no, that's all right.

I'll get it.

Sorry it took me so long to decide.

That's okay. You're worth waiting for.

Working with my father
really helped me decide.

I noticed you two are
getting along better.

Yeah. He's not so bad.

He just wants what's best for me

but he doesn't know how or what that is.

I wish I could get
along with him better too.

Oops.
That's okay, Father.

Oh no.

I'm just no good at this line of work.

It's all right.

So what happens if
you don't find a buyer?

You still gonna run away with Tate?

I'll hire someone to run the store.

Well, I can help out here
and watch the place for you.

I appreciate that but
maybe I can find someone

a little more experienced.

Don't you think you
should get to know him

a little better?

No.

Wouldn't you like a wedding?

Nah, signing some papers with
the judge is enough for me.

Did I show you the ring he gave me?

Oh, that's real nice, Katie.

Oh!

Well, it's just me.

I just snuck in the back
way to avoid being seen

by the guys at the saloon.

Huh. Yeah.

What are you looking for?

Just watching people coming and going.

Any gunfighters?

Well, some cowboy just
came out of the saloon.

Looks little suspicious.

I think he works at the Bishop's
ranch, but I'm not sure.

Ah, he's a hired hand.

Not a gunfighter?

Nah, he wears his gun belt too high.

Can't spend the
afternoon looking out the window

watching for gunfighters anyway.

Why not?

It's a waste of time.

Eventually one'll ride in,
come in here, and call me out.

There's nothing we can do.

If a gunfighter's looking for me,

they'll just come in here.

I'm not that hard to find.

I'll tell 'em you moved to Riverton.

Tell 'em I'm dead.

Tell 'em you're dead.

I could put an empty grave

near mother's in the cemetery
with your name on it.

Yeah, that'd be a neat trick.

What does love thy neighbor really mean?

Is it literal and just
means the house next door?

It means mankind.

It means treating others the
way you want them to treat you.

Do you have to be kind to someone

who doesn't go to your church
or someone you're pretty sure

is not a Christian?

What about the nice man
who's killed another?

Is it really killing if
he's done it during war?

It means love mankind.

Give others the pleasure of your company

and be kind to others.

Have a blessed week.

Thanks, Reverend, good speech.

God bless you.
Where have you been?

Katherine's mother died
and I went to be with her.

Oh, so sad.

Thank you, but things being as they are,

she wants to sell the store

and move here with me.

So do you know anybody
who wants to buy a store?

Hmm, let me think on it.

All right, in other news
she wants to marry me.

Oh, that's wonderful.

Yeah, but the store
is the last obstacle.

Don't worry. It will happen.

All right.

Why are all you lawman
such sneaky bastards?

'Cause it's what we're good at.

Well, what brings you
all the way out here?

Well, I heard that you
were back from the funeral.

I got back Sunday
just in time for church.

And here I was thinking

that you'd stay there with your woman.

Huh!

I hate to disappoint you

but I'm not wanted in that town either.

That's why I bought this place

and I plan to settle down.

Well, if that were possible,

I'd be happy for you.

I seen some stuff in town this week

and because of Lucy, I sent 'em away.

Thank you.

I don't want any trouble.

Well, as soon as my wife
can sell her store in Hayward,

I'm planning on bringing her out here.

Yeah. Lucy told me.

I sent the Robinsons down to talk to her.

They're good people the Robinsons.

They're poor but they're honest.

Hmm.

Well thank you again.

That's unexpected.

Like I said, I want peace, Mr. Butler,

and I'll get it any way I can.

All I want is peace too.

Well good.

Then we got something in common.

Hmm.

Howdy, darlin'.

Oh my God, you came back!

I told you I'd be back.

It's been such a long time.

A week.

Yeah, that's a long time.

Say, Marshall Pearson said

that he sent some people to talk to you.

The Robinsons?

Yeah, they came in yesterday.

Been trying to work with
them but they have no money.

I could give give them a
loan, but I'm not a bank.

Maybe I should-
You're wearing my ring.

Did you listen to a word I just said.

Hm.

Be careful of that.

It has my mom's dishes in it.

Why don't you go back inside

and make sure we've got everything, honey?

Is there anything I can do?

Can I help?

Oh, why don't you come over here

and help me tie down a few things, Horace.

Sure.

Hey Sheriff, come give me a hand.

Katherine wants a few
of her mother's things.

We'll be back for the hutch.

Don't worry. I'll take good care of it

until you can come back
and get it for your home.

Thank you.

Oh, why does everything she want

have to be so heavy?

Things just aren't gonna
be the same around here

with Katie gone.

Ah, don't worry.

We'll be back from time to
time to check on things.

Well, I'll keep an eye
on things here for her.

Thank you.

Robinsons know where you are?

Yeah, but they're sworn to secrecy.

But can they be trusted?

Well, if they wanna keep
running the general store,

they'll keep to themselves.

I think I've got everything for now.

Well, don't worry, Mrs. Butler,

we'll take care of things here for you.

Oh, I mean Mrs. Smith.

It was just an honest mistake.

He didn't mean anything by it.

It won't happen again.

A mistake like that could
get my husband killed!

Yeah, it's just sort of really important

that you remember from now on

we're the Smiths.

Yes, sir. Smiths.

Yes, sir, Smiths from now on.

That's right?'

The Smiths.
Smiths.

All right, Katherine,
we gotta get going.

We got a long way to go.

Whoa.

Remember we've got that one last stop.

Take a seat anywhere, mister.

That ain't no mister.

That's Tate Butler.

Mornin', Wilson.

I see you're headed out of town.

I'm headed to Riverton.

I'm giving up running for a livin'.

You're leaving?

Uh, I wonder, if before you leave,

could you sign my book for me?

Only for you would I
sign that vile thing.

Well, I'm here to stop you from moving.

I don't want you in my town.

I've already bought a place

and the wagon's packed.

And I owe it to the fine
peaceful loving citizens

of Riverton to keep you
from moving to my town.

Well, if that's what they pay you to do,

then I guess you're just
gonna have to do it.

Get in that wagon.

Get outta town.

You can't prevent me
from moving to Riverton.

I don't wanna have to
kill you, Mr. Butler.

But if you intend to head to Riverton,

I'll do just that.

You're not gonna prevent me

from taking my wife to Riverton.

Then I'm gonna have to challenge you.

I don't wanna have to shoot you, Marshall.

There'll be no killing in my place.

Outside. Now.

This is gonna be good.

I don't wanna do this, Sheriff.

Well, get up in your wagon
and head the other way.

You're not wanted in Riverton.

I can't do that!

One.

Two.

Three.

Tate!

I seen it myself.

I seen it with my own eyes.

Tate Butler, he's dead.

Go on, folks. There's
nothing to see here.

Someone get me the undertaker.

Did you have to do this?

I'm just doing my job.

Someone get this trash outta here.

Everyone deserves a
second chance, Mr. Smith.

Good job, Marshall.

Thanks for aiming high.

Thanks to the chicken blood
and the sausage casing

that really worked.

What made you think of that anyway?

Oh, I got the idea from
when Pops broke that jar

in the store.

Thank God the marshal could aim high.

Yes. Thank God Lucy
got him to play along.

You think the town really believed it?

Oh, I know Wilson did.

He'll remember that till his dying day.

How many hours is it to the ranch?

All day and into tomorrow.

This is not what I thought
shopkeeping would be like.

What did you think it would be like?

More talking to people,
learning about the town.

Oh, gossiping.

No. You know I'm not like that.

Whatever you say, dear.

Well, people in this
town are so standoffish

compared to Riverton.

No, they're not.

This is just a smaller place

and people have to work
harder to make a living.

They don't have time to hang
around town talking to you.

Well, she didn't have
to be so nasty to us

about running the store for her.

We're doing her a favor.

Now now there. She gave us a job.

She's trusting us

with this business when
no one else would help.

Well, she still treats us like dirt.

I thought you said the
people you bought it from

left a lot of furniture.

There's a table and chairs.

No one can sit in those chairs.

There's a bed.

I am not sleeping on that.

It looks like mice are living in there.

No, I'll put some new straw on it.

Fine, I'll get you a new bed.

No, I'll get it.

Well, I'll go out to the field

and I'll cut some new straw.

Thank you.

Anything else?

Yeah.

Get me some clean water.

Yes, dear.

Hey, Tate.

Coming.

Could you get me some more water please?

Yes, dear.

Thank you, my man.

Ah, no smoking in here.

Two cans of beans and
two pounds of coffee.

You need me to grind
that coffee for you?

I usually just use a rock.

Ah, you been on the trail long?

Well, seems like all my life.

Oh, what's your name, stranger,

and where are you headed?

John Scott.

Just an old man passing through.

Well, you look like you've got

a hoot and holler left in ya.

Where are you from?

Original, Indiana.

But I left there years
ago after my parents died.

Indians?

No.

Fever.

That's a terrible way to go.

I don't wanna talk about it.

Horace lost his first wife to the fever.

I said I don't wanna talk about it.

He hasn't been

the same since.
What is with-

That's right.

Anyway, looking for a friend of mine.

I thought he lived here,
but he might've moved.

Well, we just moved here ourselves

so I doubt we're gonna be much help.

I guess you don't know
where I'd find my friend.

His name's Tate Butler.

Tate Butler?

His name is Smith now
and he moved to Riverton.

No, it's not!

Tate Butler got killed in that gunfight.

I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

That's right.

Tate Butler's buried in the cemetery.

You need me
to get you anything else?

Cemetery, huh?

No, got everything I need.

What's wrong with you, woman?

He wasn't no gunfighter.

Then why was he asking about Tate?

Oh, John Scott.

What if that
was Deadshot John Scott?

It doesn't matter who he is.

You better hope he
doesn't go to Riverton.

Hm. I didn't mean anything.

Well, just keep it quiet.

We don't know how it got out.

I don't know nothing.

Huh.

It's good to see both of you.

How do you feel?

Terrible.

I just can't get comfortable.

Will it be soon?

I'm supposed to have another month.

I just want it to be over.

I can't live another month like this.

All I do was lie in bed and get fatter.

I would change places
with you in a minute.

And I don't look forward
to that bumpy wagon ride

all the way home either.

Coming, I thought I had
to pee the whole time.

Get back here!

What do you want?

Maybe the trip home will induce labor.

I just can't wait for this baby to arrive.

Tate, do you know what to
do when she goes into labor?

Well...

Well, Doc told me a few things.

I'm gonna go talk to Brice.

Oh.

Good morning.

Okay.

Honey, don't let your baby grow up

to be gunfighters.

God works in mysterious
ways and sometimes

it's not what we asked for.

Not all of us are meant to be farmers

or ranchers or parents.

God knows what our true purpose is.

And you must not question him.

See you next Sunday.

How's it going, old man?

How's married life treating you?

Oh, it agrees with me.

Maybe a little bit too
much if you ask Dusty.

So, you know Lucy

would really love to have a baby.

We've been trying.

Well, she doesn't need you telling her

she can't have a baby

in front of the entire congregation

in your sermon this morning.

That's not what I meant.

Jesus Christ.

I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry.

But you're a slower draw than I am.

It came off as mean.

Maybe you could be a
little bit more sensitive

about her, you know, feelings.

Advice from my newly
married big brother?

She was crying.

I didn't see that.

I know you didn't.

And I know 'cause you're up here,

you're busy preaching,

you're busy with the Lord,

and well, I knew that if you knew

you wouldn't wanna hurt her.

Thanks.

You guys have taught me that family

have gotta look out for each other.

I've got your back, little brother

Someday, I hope to have yours too.

Well, let's hope you don't have to.

Lucy.

You were right.

I found God and was in such
a hurry to find my brother

that I lost my compassion.

I'm sorry.

Can I help you?

I'm looking for Tate Smith.

What do you want with Tate Smith?

We have business together.

Well, that's funny

'cause I know Tate Smith real well

and I don't know you.

What are you his daddy?

Not exactly.

I'd appreciate some cooperation.

You know where I can find Tate Smith?

What if I was to tell
you I was Tate Smith?

I'd say you're a liar.

See, Tate Butler,

who now calls himself Smith,

is a lot younger

and way better looking than you.

Oh, aren't you a rude ray of sunshine.

Who sent you?

Nobody sends me anywhere.

I'm here to call him out.

You're a gunfighter.

Well, keep riding 'cause nobody here

wants to play your game.

Boy, you're dumber than you look.

You look...

The years have not been
kind to you, my friend.

Strap it on, Tate Butler.

Now!

Katherine!

Tate!

I think I'm in labor.

I'll be right there.

Good shot, honey.

Oh.

I still look like this.

But you don't look like
that anymore, Deadshot.

Tate!

I'm coming.

He's dead.

I know he's dead.

Can't you see I'm having a baby?

All right, hang on.

Hurry up.

Hold your horses.
