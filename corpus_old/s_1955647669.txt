[ CRACKLING ]

[ SIRENS WAILING ]

-COMMERCIAL FIRE WITHIN CITY
LIMITS AT ARCHER HIGH SCHOOL.

BE ADVISED, WE HAVE REPORTS
OF GUNSHOTS AT AT THE SCENE,

POSSIBLY INSIDE THE BUILDING.

[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

-...HIGH SCHOOL,
WITH FIRE SHOWING

ON THE SECOND FLOOR INSIDE
AND THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING.

[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

[ HORN HONKS ]

[ SIREN CHIRPS ]

[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

[ BRAKES SQUEAL ]

-WE HAVE A FIRE.

-GO, GO, GO!

[ ALARM RINGING ]

-OH, MY GOD.

-CAN YOU GET UP?

-I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

-LINE TO THE MAIN DOOR.

-HERE WE GO, MOVE IT, MOVE IT!

[ RINGING CONTINUES ]

-I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE.

WHAT I DID WAS WRONG.

-TAKE THAT LINE OUT THAT WAY,
OVER THERE.

-GARY, YOU HOLD LINE SOMEHOW.

-THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS ABOUT TO BLOW.

[ EXPLOSION, GLASS SHATTERS ]

-I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD END
THIS WAY.

WAIT.

[ EXPLOSIONS ]

-BE ADVISED,
WE HAVE AN EXPLOSION,

POSSIBLE CHEMICAL FIRE,
SECOND FLOOR, "A" SIDE.

UPGRADE TO SECOND ALARM.

[ HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ]

-AFTER WHAT
YOU'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH,

YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

I'M NOT SO SURE YOU CAN SAY THE
SAME ABOUT YOUR FRIEND, THOUGH.

-HUH?

-I'M SORRY.

UH, IF YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING MORE,

JUST, UH,
HAVE YOUR FOSTER PARENTS

GET AHOLD OF ME, OKAY?

[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

-ACCORDING TO CHIEF IRWIN,

IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST CHEMICAL
FIRES HE'S SEEN IN MANY YEARS.

THE WEATHER
WASN'T COOPERATING, EITHER,

FORCING THE FIREFIGHTERS TO WORK
IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

LUCY VANDER,
A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER,

WAS ALSO ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS
HELPING PUT OUT THE BLAZE.

-IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE
THE SCHOOL LIKE THIS, UH,

BUT I MOSTLY THINK ABOUT
THE FAMILIES

AND, UH, THEIR LOVED ONES
AT THIS TIME.

-THE MYSTERIOUS FIRE HAS LEFT
ARCHER HIGH SCHOOL SHUT DOWN

PENDING AN INVESTIGATION.

-THAT TAMMAND GIRL'S SUICIDE
LAST YEAR, AND NOW THIS.

I MEAN, YOU SEE THESE THINGS
HAPPENING AT OTHER SCHOOLS.

YOU JUST --

YOU JUST NEVER IMAGINE IT
HAPPENING AT YOUR OWN.

YEAH. YEAH.

YEAH, WELL, WE'RE DOING THE BEST
WE CAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

-OH, IT'S RIGHT THERE?
-THANK YOU.

-PRINCIPAL DONATO?

-HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
WE'LL BE ISSUING A STATEMENT
LATER.

IT'S THE PRESS.

-I'M FROM PHIL BENSON'S OFFICE.

-TERESA,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO, UH --

I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU
RIGHT BACK.

[ PHONE BEEPS ]

WELL, UH, WHERE'S --
WHERE'S PHIL?

-HE'S TIED UP WITH THE MAYOR.

-WHO -- WHO ARE YOU?

-I'M THE ASSOCIATE COUNSEL
UNDER MR. BENSON.

-REALLY?
[ SCOFFS ]

WHAT, ARE YOU FRESH OUT
OF LAW SCHOOL?

THIS IS A BIG DEAL,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

-PRINCIPAL...
-YES?

-I AM HERE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS,

AND I NEED YOU TO COOPERATE,
UNDERSTAND?

-I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

UH, I'M A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS

WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON HERE TODAY.

UH, LET ME JUST GO GET
THE FILES.

-GREAT, I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

-I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK
ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT.

WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH US,
ARCHER'S BANK ACCOUNT

IS GONNA MAKE US LOOK LIKE
WE'RE LOCATED IN THE PROJECTS.

-WILL THE PARENTS SUE?

-THE PARENTS
ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE.

FOSTER CARE.

BUT YOU BETTER BELIEVE
THAT ONCE THIS THING LEAKS,

EVERY AMBULANCE-CHASING,
BLOOD-SUCKING ATTORNEY

IN THE STATE
IS GONNA BE CALLING THIS KID.

NO OFFENSE.

-I'M HERE TO BUILD A CASE THAT
ALEX'S OWN POOR DECISION-MAKING

LED US TO THIS SITUATION.

AS A RESULT, ANY PUBLICITY OR
THREATS OF LAWSUIT WILL GO AWAY.

IN HERE?

-YEAH, YEAH.

-THANK YOU.

-HELLO, ALEX.

-IS MY PAPERWORK DONE YET?

-NOT YET.

-ALEX, THIS IS LAURA SEDGEWICK.

SHE, UH --

SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

-I ALREADY TALKED TO THE POLICE.

-I-I WORK FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD.

IT, UH, WON'T BE A PROBLEM

IF WE TALK HERE IN PRIVATE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, WILL IT?

-NO, I'LL CHECK WITH
THE DETECTIVE, BUT, UH --

-THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM?

-NO, NO.

THE, UH, PHONE LINES ARE DOWN,

SO IF YOU NEED ME,
I'M...ON CHANNEL 2.

I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE,
THEN.

-I ALREADY TOLD THE POLICE
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

-I DOUBT THAT.

-WHEN MY PAPERWORK COMES
THROUGH, I'M ALLOWED TO LEAVE.

-I SEE YOU'RE IN FOSTER CARE.

THAT MEANS THAT EVERY ASPECT
OF YOUR TRANSFER

HAS TO GO THROUGH
SOCIAL SERVICES,

AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE
OF HOW EFFICIENT THEY CAN BE.

I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL,

EVEN THE ONES YOU DIDN'T TELL
THE POLICE.

-I TOLD YOU,
I TOLD THE POLICE EVERYTHING.

-[ SCOFFS ]

-HOW DO I EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A COP?

-HERE'S MY CARD.

OTHER THAN THAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

I'M GONNA BE BLUNT.

THE SOONER YOU'RE OUT OF THE
SCHOOL SYSTEM, THE BETTER.

BUT BEFORE I CAN ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN,

I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

EVERYTHING.

OFF THE RECORD.

-[ CLEARS THROAT ]

AND WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY?

-WELL, THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE,
BUT I WILL WARN YOU

THAT IT COULD MAKE THE REST
OF YOUR FORMATIVE YEARS
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

-W-WHAT EXACTLY...DO YOU WANT?

-WE CAN START
FROM THE BEGINNING.

-IT ALL STARTED A FEW WEEKS AGO.

LOOKING AROUND
THAT DETENTION ROOM,

IT WAS AS UNLIKELY A GROUP
AS YOU'D EVER FIND.

A CLASS PRESIDENT,
HIS POPULAR GIRLFRIEND,

TWO OF THE BIGGEST TROUBLEMAKERS
IN THE SCHOOL...

AND ME.

-THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

-NO TALKING.

-THEN IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR HER.

-I SAID, NO TALKING!

-VERY NICE, GUYS.

JUST GREAT.

REALLY.

NO DEFENSE,
NO PLEAS OF INNOCENCE?

IS SOMEONE GONNA AT LEAST TRY?

YES, CAMERON.

-I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT, MR. CONNOR.

-"A" FOR EFFORT, CAMERON.

YOU SEE, THE ANSWER KEY TO THE
MIDTERM WAS STOLEN LAST WEEK.

NOW, WHEN THIS WAS BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION,

MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, GREAT,

NOW I HAVE TO WRITE
A NEW 250-QUESTION TEST.

BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT
IF I KEPT THE SAME EXAM,

I COULD NAIL WHOEVER STOLE IT
AND EITHER PASSED IT OUT,

OR, MORE LIKELY,
SOLD IT TO HIS BUDDIES.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHEAT
ON A MULTIPLE-CHOICE TEST,

AT LEAST GET A COUPLE WRONG,
YOU KNOW?

AIM FOR A B-PLUS TOPS,
ESPECIALLY YOU TWO CLOWNS.

-[ Russian accent ] HOW
DO YOU KNOW WE DID NOT
JUST STUDY EXTRA HARD?

-SAVE IT, PUTIN!

NOW YOU'RE ALL GETTING ZEROS
ON THE MIDTERM.

-WAIT, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
THAT'S GONNA RUIN MY GPA!

-I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

-YOU CHEATED!

YOU ALL JUST CHEATED ON ONE OF
THE BIGGEST TESTS OF THE YEAR.

YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T BRING THIS
TO THE PRINCIPAL.

I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE.

-[ LAUGHING ]

-WELL, WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME,
RIGHT, GUYS?

-DO YOU REALIZE
HOW SCREWED WE ARE?

-NO, I DON'T.

DO YOU FEEL SCREWED, RICKY?
-NYET.

-IT'S EASY NOT TO CARE WHEN YOU
DON'T PLAN ON GOING TO COLLEGE.

-TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND
THAT ELITISM

IS NO WAY TO GET ME TO HELP HIM
OUT OF THIS JAM.

-YOU THINK WE CAN FIX THIS?

-WE?

WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

-ALEX.
-[ SCOFFS ]

I DON'T NEED SOME LOSER MAKING
THINGS EVEN WORSE FOR ME.

-[ LAUGHS ]

-SO, DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

-AFTER A DAY IN I.S.S.,

CAMERON AND RICKY
TOLD US THEIR PLAN.

THEY'D BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT
SINCE THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR.

IT WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA,

CONSIDERING THAT
THESE WERE THE GUYS

THAT THOUGHT SETTING UP A STINK
BOMB WAS A REVOLUTIONARY ACT.

THEIR PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY WERE
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE,

SO THEY NEEDED STUDENTS
WITH ACCESS TO THINGS

THAT THEY COULDN'T GET TO.

I GUESS US GETTING CAUGHT ON
THAT TEST WAS THEIR LUCKY BREAK.

-IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN.

WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MR. PRESIDENT?

-I THINK YOU'RE ALL IDIOTS.

COME ON, CARLA.

-THIS ISN'T FAIR, JACK.
-I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN
IN ENOUGH TROUBLE.

I'M NOT ABOUT TO GET IN ANY MORE
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
TELLING ME TO.

-WHY? WHATEVER, THEN YOU'LL
JUST FAIL CONNOR'S CLASS.

HOW'S THAT GOING
TO LOOK TO DARTMOUTH?
-IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK PRETTY.

-EXACTLY, SO WHY DON'T WE
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

-I AM.
I'M GONNA STUDY.

-IF YOU WERE ANY GOOD
AT STUDYING,

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THE
TEST ANSWERS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

IF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT ME,
YOU WOULD DO THIS!

JACK, YOU OWE ME THIS!

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]
-JACK? JACK?!

-WE'RE HERE, SON.

IT'S MOM AND DAD.

YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

-IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

-SHUSH, BUDDY.
-IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
-WHAT'S HE SAYING?

-IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

-WHAT HAPPENED?
-HE JUST STARTED TALKING.

-HE'S GOING INTO
HYPOGLYCEMIC SHOCK.

-STOP IT, JACK.
PLEASE, STOP IT.

[ ALARM BLARING ]

[ INDISTINCT TALKING ]

-JACK!
[ CRYING ]

HE'S OUR BOY.

[ RAPID BEEPING ]

-YEAH.

[ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ]

-WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PARTY
THIS WEEKEND.

YOU GUYS DOWN FOR THAT?

IT'S ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
IT'S AT PHIL'S HOUSE.

SO WE JUST GOT
A LITTLE SHOPPING LIST

OF WHAT WE NEED
FOR THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

WE'RE GONNA DO PB&J's THIS WEEK.

UM, AND AFTERWARDS,

WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE TOP
OF THE WORLD AND GET CRUNK.

IT'LL BE FUN.
YOU GUYS SHOULD COME.

UMM --
IT SHOULD BE FUN --

-JACK.
-WHAT?!

-CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

-I'M BUSY.

-IT'S ABOUT MR. CONNOR'S CLASS.

-I'M GONNA GO DEAL WITH THIS.

WE'LL TALK LATER, ALL RIGHT?

THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

FAILING A CLASS IS BAD,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE?

GETTING EXPELLED.

-BUT IF IT WORKS,
WE COME OUT AHEAD.

-WHAT DO YOU CARE, ANYWAYS?
YOU NEVER TALK IN CLASS.

YOU DON'T DO ANY SPORTS.
YOU DON'T DO ANY CLUBS.

IS IT REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL
TO YOU IF YOU FAIL A CLASS?

-I HAVE TO GET CERTAIN GRADES
TO STAY WHERE I AM.

-AND I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

-I --
-COME ON, ALEX, WHAT?

-I LIVE --

I LIVE IN A FOSTER HOME.

AND IN ORDER TO STAY WHERE I AM,
I HAVE TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL.

THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR.

I-I CAN'T FAIL A CLASS.

-DO YOU LIKE YOUR FOSTER FAMILY?

-COMPARED TO THE OTHERS...

THIS ONE'S NOT SO BAD.

LOOK, I'M NOT --

I'M NOT SAYING DO IT BECAUSE
OF ME OR ANYONE ELSE.

IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING,
WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

THERE'S A LOT MORE TO GAIN
THAN TO LOSE.

-HOW DID YOU
EVENTUALLY BREAK JACK DOWN?

-IS THAT WHAT IT SAYS,
THAT I BROKE HIM DOWN?

-THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

I MEAN, HE WAS THE LAST ONE
TO COME ALONG, RIGHT?

-NO, JACK BROKE HIMSELF DOWN.

-OH, REALLY?

-HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.
-HMM.

-NONE OF US WANTED TO DO THIS.
THERE WAS NO OTHER OPTION.

WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

-KEEP GOING.

-PULLING IT OFF.
WE WERE --

WE WERE HELPING OURSELVES
WHILE HELPING EACH OTHER.

JACK WAS HELPING HIMSELF.

WE JUST HAD TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYBODY DID THEIR PART.

ARE YOU SURE IT'S BIG ENOUGH?

-I DON'T KNOW!
IT WAS EXPENSIVE, OKAY?

DON'T SCREW THIS UP.
[ SIGHS ]

-MR. GRIFFIN LEFT
SOME FILING FOR YOU,

AND AFTER THAT, MRS. LYONS
NEEDS HER ATTENDANCE FINALIZED

FOR PROGRESS REPORTS.

-ANYTHING ELSE?

-YOU SHOULD GET YOUR CHECK
ON FRIDAY.

-GREAT.

CAMERON AND RICKY WERE IN CHARGE

OF GETTING
THE TEACHERS' PASSWORDS.

RICKY HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA
OF GETTING A TRANSMITTER

THAT WOULD GIVE US A RUNNING LOG
OF EVERYTHING TYPED INTO THE
SCHOOL COMPUTERS, BUT --

[ SNIFFLES ]
IT TURNED OUT THAT STUFF ONLY
EXISTED IN JAMES BOND MOVIES.

CAMERON HAD
A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH.

HE KNEW HE COULD FIND
THE TEACHERS' LOG-INS
IN THE I.T. OFFICE,

BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

HE STILL NEEDED A COPY
OF THE NETWORK

WHERE THE GRADES WERE STORED.
-[ CLEARS THROAT ]

-THAT'S WHERE JACK AND I
CAME IN.

-YES, JACK.

-I WANT TO CALL
AN OFFICE MEETING.

-WHAT?

-AS PRESIDENT
OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL,

I WANT TO CALL
AN OFFICE MEETING.

-ABOUT WHAT?

-ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT OUR SCHOOL
HAS BEEN IGNORING SINCE
I'VE BEEN HERE.

-ALL RIGHT.

LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]
IF I COULD HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, PLEASE.

OUR STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT
HAS EXERCISED HIS RIGHT TO
CALL AN OFFICE MEETING.

IF YOU COULD PLEASE JOIN US
IN THE STAFF LOUNGE, THANK YOU.

-UM -- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

-HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

-[ CLICKS TONGUE ]

-OH, GOD! JESUS! SHIT!

-WHAT DID HE DO?

WHERE IS HE GOING?
RICKY!

-OH, NO!

-WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

-IT'S BURNT, IT'S BURNT,
IT'S BURNT!

NO, YOU DON'T GOT TO SEE IT!

IT'S A GODDAMN --
GOT A FIRE IN MY EYES!

-LET ME SEE IT.
-NO!

-HEY!
-OKAY, CAN I SEE IT?

-DON'T USE
THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.
-WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

-YOU GONNA WANT ME
TO GO GET THE NURSE?

-IF HE'S GONNA USE
THIS KIND OF...

-OVER 150,000 STUDENTS
SKIP SCHOOL EVERY DAY

BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING BULLIED,

AND AT LEAST 1 IN EVERY 20
AMERICAN STUDENTS

HAVE WITNESSED ANOTHER STUDENT
WITH A GUN AT THE SCHOOL.

-WE KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM,
JACK.

WE GET TRAINED BY THE STATE
ON HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.

[ RICKY SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ]

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

-[ SIGHS ]

-SO, WHY ISN'T IT GETTING
ANY BETTER?

-WELL, UH, TEENAGERS, BY NATURE,

ARE NOT
THE MOST SYMPATHETIC GROUP.

WE CAN'T JUST WAVE A MAGIC WAND
AND MAKE EVERYONE

BE NICE TO EACH OTHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]

-CALM DOWN. JUST LOWER
YOUR VOICE, ALL RIGHT?

WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.
-NO, I'M NOT GONNA LOWER
MY VOICE, OKAY?!

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

-SHARED NETWORK DRIVE.

-OKAY, SO WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
LETTING BAD THINGS HAPPEN?

-WE STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE HERE
AT ARCHER.

ONE STUDENT AT A TIME.

-I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.

WHY NOT ONE SCHOOL AT A TIME?

WE'RE A TEAM, AREN'T WE?

WHY NOT ONE NATION AT A TIME?

WHY DO WE HAVE TO STOP THERE?

DO YOU REALIZE WHAT A STUDENT
GOES THROUGH?

[ RICKY SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ]

-GO SEE THE NURSE!
-DON'T PUSH HIM, THOUGH.

DON'T PUSH HIM.

-...FIRE! SCREW YOU!

-JUST GO TO THE NURSE!

-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

-I-I --
-YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME.

-THIS WAS HERE
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

UH, IT WAS -- I --

-JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
GO BACK TO CLASS.

-YOU WANT ME TO --
-GO BACK TO CLASS.

-ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

-REALLY?

-YOU THINK --
YOU THINK THAT WAS ME?
-AT LEAST CLOSE THE DOOR.

OKAY, WHATEVER.

-THERE YOU GO.
THEY'RE ALL UP THERE.

-HE'S THERE.
-I KNOW, THERE'S
LIKE FOUR OF THEM.

-HOW DO I GET TO
THE NEXT CHECKPOINT?

-SO, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE IT UP TO US

IF THESE NUMBERS DON'T WORK?

-THEY'LL WORK.

PLUS, I WOULDN'T WANT TO COME
BETWEEN YOU AND RICKY.

-WE HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.
[ MUNCHES ]

-NICE JOB WITH THAT BULLSHIT

YOU TOLD ME TO FEED DONATO,
BY THE WAY.

HEY, YOU CRIMINAL MASTERMINDS

FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE GRADES
BACK IN THE SYSTEM YET?

-YEAH, WE GOT IT.

-AS LONG AS I CAN GET BACK IN
THE I.T. OFFICE.

-EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS DEPARTMENT POLICY

TO LET STUDENTS MAKE UP ANY LABS
THAT THEY MISSED,

CAMERON CARING
ABOUT MISSING CLASS

SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
HIS ATTENTION,

BUT FAUSTIN DIDN'T NOTICE.

-[ CLEARS THROAT ]

-MR. FAUSTIN?

-YEAH.

-I NEED TO GO TO THE RESTROOM.

-AND I CARE ABOUT THAT WHY?

-FAUSTIN DIDN'T NOTICE MUCH,
SO LONG AS IT DIDN'T REQUIRE
ANY EFFORT ON HIS PART.

[ BELL RINGING ]

-I'M TELLING YOU...
[ WHISPERING ]

WHAT'S UP, FREAK?!
[ TRAY THUDS ]

[ LAUGHTER ]

-WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

-IT'S COOL, BRO.

-ALEX.

-AND OVERNIGHT,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

[ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS ]

-OKAY?

[ Laughing ]
AGAIN, ONE MORE TIME.

-THEY EVEN INVITED ME
TO CELEBRATE OUR VICTORY.

EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

IT WAS LIKE WE NEVER EVEN GOT
CAUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

WE WERE ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

THERE WAS NO WAY
ANY OF US COULD HAVE GUESSED

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.

-GOOD NIGHT, MOM.
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

[ COMPUTER DINGS ]

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

[ PHONE VIBRATES ]
[ GASPS ]

-YO, JUST LET ME HANDLE THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

-OKAY, JUST LOOK FOR ME, OKAY?
-HOW?

-I DIDN'T WANT ANY OF THEM.
-SHE --

-WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

-I DON'T CARE, OKAY, BECAUSE
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

-STOP!
-WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

WHAT HAPPENED?

-WE -- WAS ANYBODY BOTHERING YOU
LAST NIGHT, ALEX?

LIKE, ONLINE?

-I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO USE
THE INTERNET FOR SCHOOL WORK.

-YOU'RE USELESS.

-WHY?

-WE ALL GOT MESSAGES LAST NIGHT.

SOMEONE ONLINE
KNOWS WHAT WE DID.

-WHO ARE THEY FROM?
-WHO CARES WHO THEY WERE FROM?

IF SHE HADN'T KILLED HERSELF, NO
ONE WOULD EVEN KNOW WHO SHE WAS.

-HEY, HEY, YOUR BOYFRIEND
WOULD KNOW WHO SHE WAS, OKAY?

-WE ALL KNEW WHO SHE WAS.
I KNEW WHO SHE WAS.

RICKY KNEW WHO SHE WAS, AND JACK
DEFINITELY KNEW WHO SHE IS.

-IT DOESN'T MATTER.
-WHO ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT?

-BRITTANY.

BRITTANY TAMMAND
SENT US THE MESSAGES.

-WHO'S BRITTANY?

ALEX.

ALEX, WHO IS BRITTANY?

I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED,

BUT I NEED YOU
TO KEEP GOING, OKAY?

WHO WAS BRITTANY?

-SHE WAS A TYPICAL PUNCHING BAG.

-SHE GOT IN A LOT OF FIGHTS
OR...?

-YOU WORK FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD,

BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN SCHOOL.

-SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

-IT DOESN'T SEEM
THAT COMPLICATED.

KID'S POPULAR, COMES FROM
A GOOD FAMILY,

GETS GOOD GRADES,
PLAYS SPORTS, WHATEVER.

THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.

YOU KNOW, IN AN IDEAL SYSTEM,
THE KIDS WOULD RUN THE SCHOOL.

THEY'D MAKE THE RULES
AND DISH OUT THE PUNISHMENTS.

ADULTS HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT KIDS ARE REALLY LIKE.

THE OLDER YOU ARE,
THE MORE YOU FORGET.

-I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T READ
"LORD OF THE FLIES" YET, HUH?

NEVER MIND.

KEEP GOING.

-THEY SAY SHE HAD
A TERRIBLE REPUTATION.

-SHE SLEPT AROUND,
SHE WAS PROMISCUOUS?

-MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

SINCE WHEN DO KIDS CARE

IF THE RUMORS THAT THEY HEAR
IN THE HALLS ARE TRUE?

-I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

-IT WAS A YEAR BEFORE I CAME
TO ARCHER, BUT APPARENTLY,
SHE DROWNED HERSELF.

SHE LEFT A NOTE ON THE SHORE.

NO ONE EVEN NOTICED.

SHE JUST WENT IN,
AND THEN SHE WAS GONE.

-W-WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, ALEX,
THAT -- THAT BRITTANY TAMMAND

WAS TRYING TO REACH YOU GUYS
FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE?

-NO, I'M TELLING YOU
THAT WHOEVER KNEW WHAT WE DID

MADE AN ONLINE PROFILE
AS BRITTANY TAMMAND

TO GET OUR ATTENTION.

AND IT WORKED.

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

-MR. AND MRS. STANTON?
-YES.

-DETECTIVE HUTISAWA
OF COUNTY HOMICIDE.

I HEAR YOUR SON'S BEEN SAYING
SOME PRETTY DISCONCERTING
THINGS.

-[ SIGHS ]
-JACK'S A GOOD BOY.

HE WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.

-WELL, SOMETIMES
AFTER TRAUMATIC EVENTS,

PEOPLE LET THE GUILT OF NOT
BEING ABLE TO STOP WHAT HAPPENED

TRICK THEM INTO THINKING
THEY'RE THE ONES TO BLAME.

-YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

-NO, NOT REALLY, BUT I DO
THINK THAT JACK COULD
TELL ME SOMETHING

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THAT I DON'T KNOW YET.

-IS MY PAPERWORK DONE YET?

-MISS SEDGEWICK,
MAY I HAVE A WORD, PLEASE?

-[ SIGHS ]
-[ SIGHS ]

WHAT?

-I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE HOSPITAL.
-AND?

-JACK STANTON,
THE STUDENT IN THE I.C.U.,

HE'S ON THE VERGE OF AN
ANESTHESIA-INDUCED CONFESSION.

-WHAT'S HE GUILTY OF?
-THEY'RE NOT SURE,

BUT IT MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING
ELSE TO THE STORY WE
DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

-WHATEVER IT IS, IF HE CONFESSES
ANYTHING ON A MORPHINE DRIP,
IT'LL NEVER HOLD UP IN COURT.

-I KNOW, I KNOW.
THE DETECTIVE SAID THAT, TOO.

BUT...IF WE CAN GET ALEX
TO IMPLICATE JACK...

...THE SCHOOL
COULD ESCAPE LIABILITY.

-[ SIGHS ]

IN THE MEANTIME,
GET ME WHATEVER YOU HAVE

ON BRITTANY TAMMAND.
[ DOOR OPENS ]

[ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ]

-EVERYTHING OKAY?

-I WANT YOU TO TELL ME MORE
ABOUT JACK.

-I AM TELLING YOU ABOUT JACK.

I'M -- I'M TELLING YOU
ABOUT EVERYONE.

-YEAH, BUT WHAT WAS HE LIKE
BEFORE YOU GOT INVOLVED
IN ALL OF THIS?

-HE WAS POPULAR.
HE WAS...CLASS PRESIDENT.

HE WAS IN A -- A BUNCH OF CLUBS.
HE --

GIRLS LIKED HIM.
HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD GUY.

-HE BOUGHT TEST ANSWERS

AND THEN LIED AND CHEATED
HIS WAY OUT OF IT WHEN
HE GOT CAUGHT.

-I DID THAT, TOO.

-YEAH, BUT YOU DID THAT
SO YOU WOULDN'T GET KICKED
OUT OF YOUR FOSTER HOME.

YOU'RE A VICTIM OF THE SYSTEM.

JACK WAS ON TOP OF THE SYSTEM.

-NO, HE WANTED
TO GO TO DARTMOUTH.

-[ CHUCKLES ]

DON'T -- DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME?

A LITTLE SELFISH
AND -- AND CONNIVING?

-I-I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S MY FRIEND.

-WOULDN'T A REAL FRIEND HAVE
TRIED TO TALK YOU OUT OF
GETTING INTO THIS MESS?

THEY USED YOU TO GET
INTO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE NOBODY.

DON'T YOU THINK THEY
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT?

-NO, WE WERE A TEAM.
-WHAT KIND OF TEAM MEMBER

LETS HIS FRIENDS DIE
SO HE CAN GO TO COLLEGE?!

JACK DIDN'T CARE ABOUT YOU!
YOU WERE A NOBODY TO JACK!

YOU WERE NOT JACK'S FRIEND!

LOOK, ALEX.

ALEX, LOOK.
-[ CRIES ]

-I'M -- I'M NOT -- I'M --

[ SIGHS ]

I'M -- I'M NOT TRYING
TO UPSET YOU.

I JUST REALLY WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT

WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD DO THIS

IF THEY DIDN'T
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

MAYBE JACK WASN'T THE PERSON
THAT YOU THOUGHT HE WAS.

JACK WAS NOT A GOOD GUY.

-NO.

NO, I KNOW HIM.

[ SNIFFLES ]

HE MAY HAVE NOT MADE
THE RIGHT DECISIONS,

BUT...AT THE END OF THE DAY,
HE WAS A GOOD PERSON.

I PROMISE, HE WAS GOOD.

[ SNIFFLES ]

-SO, UM, WHAT DID --

WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN THE OTHERS
TOLD YOU ABOUT THE MESSAGES?

-[ SNIFFLES ]
EVERYONE WAS JUST FREAKED OUT.

-YEAH.

-[ SNIFFLES ]

I JUST -- I JUST TRIED TO
PRETEND IT WASN'T HAPPENING.

CAMERON AND RICKY
WERE NOTORIOUS,

AND CARLA AND JACK
WERE THE MOST POPULAR.

IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE
MESSING WITH THEM.

I JUST FIGURED AS LONG AS NO ONE
WAS CONTACTING ME,

THEN IT WAS JUST SOMEONE
PLAYING A TRICK.

BUT I WAS REALLY WRONG.

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

THEY HAVE MY BIRTHDAY,

MY ADDRESS, MY --
MY PHONE NUMBER, EVERYTHING.

HOW DID THEY GET THIS STUFF?
I DIDN'T SET UP THIS ACCOUNT.

-WELL, WHOEVER
IT IS, THEY GO TO ARCHER.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE PICTURE.

-I SAY WE FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE,
WE BEAT THEM DOWN, AND THEY
NEVER TRY THIS GAME AGAIN!

-LOOK HOW SCARED THIS PERSON HAS
US WITHOUT EVEN DOING ANYTHING?

ALL RIGHT, IF THEY DON'T WANT US
TO FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE,
THEN WE WON'T.

-WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE WANTS
FROM US?

-I DON'T KNOW.

[ COMPUTER DINGS ]

-YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

-OPEN IT.

OPEN IT.

-[ Digitized voice ]
YOU'RE EARLY...

AND NOT ALONE.

-WHO ARE YOU?

-I'M BRITTANY TAMMAND, DUH.

-NO, YOU'RE NOT.
BRITTANY TAMMAND'S DEAD.

-YOU ALL KNEW ME
WHEN I WAS ALIVE.

-NO, I NEVER KNEW YOU.

-BUT YOUR FRIENDS DID.

AND THAT MAKES YOU GUILTY
BY ASSOCIATION.

CHEATER.

-WHAT DO YOU WANT?

-I WANT WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE,

AND YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
ARE GOING TO HELP ME GET IT.

-RIGHTFULLY YOURS?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

-I'LL BE GIVING EACH
OF YOU LITTLE CHORES
IN THE UPCOMING DAYS.

IF ONE OF YOU FAILS,
THEN I'LL EXPOSE THEM
TO THE ADMINISTRATION.

BUT FOR YOUR SAKES,
I HOPE YOU SUCCEED,

BECAUSE SOMETHING
TELLS ME LOYALTY IS YOUR
LITTLE GROUP'S STRONG SUIT.

-YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.
-OH, AM I?

-CALLING US CHEATERS
DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.
YOU'RE A LIAR.

[ COMPUTER DINGS ]

-OPEN IT!

[ COMPUTER DINGS ]

-I HAVE MORE,
BUT THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO
GET THE PRINCIPAL'S ATTENTION.

-I'LL KILL YOU.

-[ LAUGHS ]
I'M ALREADY DEAD, REMEMBER?

-LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO?

-YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

I HAVE ALL YOUR PHONE NUMBERS.

BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

[ COMPUTER BEEPS ]

-WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

-WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHOEVER THIS IS.

UNTIL THEN, WE DO EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAYS, OKAY?

-JACK TRIED TO BE BRAVE
AND TAKE CHARGE,

BUT I KNEW HE AND EVERYONE ELSE
WERE JUST AS AFRAID AS I WAS.

[ PHONE VIBRATES ]

I MEAN, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT
BRITTANY WAS GONNA ASK US TO DO

OR -- OR HOW TO TRACK DOWN
WHO SHE WAS.

-WHY DO YOU THINK THAT CAMERON
WAS THE FIRST ONE

THAT BRITTANY CONTACTED?

-WELL, EVERYONE AT ARCHER KNOWS
THAT CAMERON'S THE GUY TO GO TO

IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
THAT'S HARD TO FIND.

-LIKE DRUGS?

-I SAID HARD TO FIND,

LIKE STOLEN ANSWER KEYS
AND TEACHER LOG-INS.

ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CAMERON
USED TO MAKE MONEY

WAS BY MAKING
HIGH-QUALITY FAKE I.D.s.

LIKE, THE REALLY GOOD ONES,

THE TYPE THAT SCAN
AT A LIQUOR STORE.

SO, BRITTANY TEXTED CAMERON
ALL THE INFORMATION SHE WANTED,

AND -- AND FOR HIM, IT WAS EASY.

HE'D DONE IT A MILLION TIMES.

-DON'T LOOK LIKE NO BRITTANY
I REMEMBER.

-DO YOU THINK SHE'LL LEAVE US
ALONE NOW?

-NO ONE GOES THROUGH
THIS MUCH TROUBLE TO BUY BEER.

-HEY, WHY DOES THIS
HAVE MY ADDRESS?

-THAT'S WHAT SHE ASKED FOR.

-OH, NO, I DON'T LIKE THIS.
WELL, IT'S -- IT'S STUPID.

SHE CAN'T EVEN USE IT.
IT'S GOT THE WRONG PICTURE.

-YEAH, BUT IF IT WAS A REAL
PICTURE, WE'D KNOW WHO SHE IS.

-IT'S JUST -- I DON'T GET WHY
SOMEONE WOULD WANT AN I.D.

THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN USE.

-WHO THE HELL YOU THINK
KELLY HANSON IS?

-ARE YOU JUST GONNA STAND THERE
OR SAY SOMETHING USEFUL?

-SHE TEXTED ME.

-WELL, WHAT'D IT SAY?

-SHE SENT ME
A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

-FOR WHAT?

-I DON'T KNOW.

-I THINK, UM --

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

SHE MIGHT WANT US TO USE IT
WITH THIS.

[ SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ]

-RICKY WAS THE NEXT ONE
TO GET A CALL.

[ PHONE VIBRATING ]

-YES?

-a copy of your parents' rental

would sure go nicely with
your friends' new information.

[ CLICK ]

-WE KNEW BRITTANY WAS HAVING US
GATHER PIECES TO A PUZZLE.

WE JUST HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE
PUZZLE WAS GOING TO ADD UP TO.

AND WE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED
THAT WITH SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS AND LEASES,

WE WERE GETTING INTO SOMETHING
A LOT MORE SERIOUS

THAN JUST CHANGING GRADES.

-[ SNORING ]

-SO, WE HAVE AN I.D., A SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBER, AND A LEASE.

-WE'RE MAKING
AN IMAGINARY PERSON.

-YEAH, THAT'S WHAT A FAKE I.D.
IS FOR, GENIUS.

-NO, THIS IS MORE THAN THAT.
WE'RE CREATING A PERSON THAT
EXISTS LEGALLY ON PAPER.

-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

-IT MEANS GO TO JAIL, RICKY,
GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL.

DON'T GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL,
DON'T COLLECT ANY GRADUATION
MONEY.

[ PHONE VIBRATES ]

-WHAT IS IT?

ALEX!

-ACCOUNT WNB.

-WHAT?
-WHAT?

-WELD NATIONAL.

GUYS, S-SHE WANTS US
TO SET UP A BANK ACCOUNT.

[ COMPUTER CLACKING ]

-YOU CAN GET THE MAIL
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS, RIGHT?

-YES.

THEY WORK LATE.

-I HOPE THIS WORKS.

-I COULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW EASY IT WAS.

A PHOTO I.D., A SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER, AND PROOF OF RESIDENCE

WAS ALL WE NEEDED
TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT.

WITH A FEW PIECES
OF INFORMATION,

WE MADE A PERSON
OUT OF THIN AIR,

AND ALL I KEPT
THINKING ABOUT WAS,

WHO COULD BE DOING THIS TO US?

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHEN WOULD IT STOP?

-ALEX.

COME HERE.

YOU OKAY?

-NOT REALLY.

-ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME THINKING.

EVEN IF WE COULD TRACK
THE CELLPHONE NUMBER,

IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BURNER,
ANYWAYS, SO --
-WHAT?

-IT'S A PREPAID PHONE
WITH NO PLAN, SO NO RECORDS.

WELL, I DID FIND THIS.

-WHAT IS IT?

-I SAW THIS THING ON THE NEWS
ABOUT HOW THEY TRACK
INTERNET PERVERTS

BY TRACING THEIR I.P. ADDRESS,
AND BAS--

-WHAT'S AN I.P. ADDRESS?

-IT'S LIKE
AN INTERNET FINGERPRINT
THAT ALL COMPUTERS HAVE.

ANYWAYS, I LOG INTO THE ACCOUNT
BRITTANY GAVE YOU,

AND I SPENT ALL MORNING
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

HOW TO TRACE
THE E-MAIL SHE SENT.

THIS IS WHAT I FOUND.

THE SIGNAL WAS COMING FROM HERE.

IT'S ARCHER.

WHOEVER WAS TALKING TO US
THE OTHER NIGHT WAS DOING IT
FROM THE SCHOOL.

AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YET,

BUT WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER

TO NAILING THIS ASSHOLE.

-[ SCOFFS ]

WELL, LET'S JUST FOLLOW
BRITTANY'S EXAMPLE.

-IF BRITTANY VIDEO CHATTED US
FROM ARCHER,

THEN ALL WE'D HAVE TO DO WAS
FIND THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

FROM THAT NIGHT.

SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST SITTING AROUND
BEING SCARED,

JUST WAITING TO BE TOLD
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

BUT IF WE FOUND THAT FOOTAGE, WE
WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHO SHE WAS.

-WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

-[ Russian accent ]
MY APOLOGIES.

I THOUGHT THE ICE CREAM
REMIND YOU OF THE GULAG.

-[ SPEAKING RUSSIAN ]

SON OF A BITCH!
HUH?!

-[ Normal voice ] YOU SHOULDN'T
TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER
THAT WAY, RICKY.

-WELL, AT LEAST
MY MOTHER NEVER SLEPT
WITH MY LITTLE LEAGUE COACH.

-I TOLD YOU THAT SHIT
IN CONFIDENCE.

-HUH? WELL, WHAT YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! HUH?

COME ON!

-[ SNIFFS ]

YOU SMELL THAT?
[ SNIFFS ]

I SMELL THIS VAGINA.
IT SMELLS LIKE COMMUNISM.

-OOH!
-OOH!

-WELL, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT
FOR MR. RANDALS.

COME ON!

[ ALL SHOUTING ]

-YOUR MOTHER'S VAGINA
SMELLS LIKE SALT...

-OH, YOU!
-HUH?

NYET, NYET, NYET, NYET!

HOW YOU LIKE THAT, RUSSIAN BOY?
YOU LIKE THAT?

-KGB THIS!

-OFFICER RANDALS, WE NEED YOU
IN THE CAFETERIA.

-RIGHT AWAY?

-Yes, right away.
We have a fight.

-WHAT THE --
NONE OF THESE SCREENS
ARE WORKING.

THEY'RE NOT TURNING ON.

-START PRESSING THINGS.

-[ SCOFFS, SIGHS ]

-HEY! HEY!
MAKE A PATH, MAKE A PATH!

YOU TWO, BREAK IT UP!

STOP IT, STOP IT!
BREAK IT UP!

EVERYBODY GO BACK TO EATING
THEIR LUNCHES!

CALM DOWN!
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!

LET'S GO, CAMERON!
COME ON!

-OKAY, I THINK
I FOUND SOMETHING.

-SPEAK ENGLISH, ALL RIGHT?
-OKAY.

-W-WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
-WHAT'S WRONG?

-THERE'S LIKE -- THERE'S LIKE
A MILLION FOLDERS IN HERE.

-JUST TAKE WHATEVER YOU CAN.
-ARE YOU STUPID?!

THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS!
-SHH!

-COME ON, YOU TWO.
SIT!

-THERE'S TOO MANY FILES IN HERE,
AND THEY'RE WAY TOO BIG.

-CAN'T YOU JUST E-MAIL THEM
TO YOUR HOUSE?

-JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?
I'M TRYING TO THINK,
AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

-KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELVES.
THE PRINCIPAL WILL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.

AND WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

-ANYTHING?

-I DON'T KNOW WHICH CAMERA
IS WHICH.

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
KEEPING WATCH.

-He's back.

He's back, Jack.

-SHIT.

-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

-UH, I THINK
I SAW SOME KIDS SMOKING POT
IN THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.

I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

-LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

[ SIGHS ]

-OH, MY GOD.

[ BIRD CHIRPING ]

-SO, YOU MEAN WE GOT THREE MORE
DAYS OF I.S.S. FOR NO REASON?
-LIKE YOU CARE.

-A BIG PART OF ME WANTS
YOUR BRAINS AT THE BOTTOM
OF MY SHOES RIGHT NOW.

-LOOK,
IT'S A COMPLICATED SYSTEM.

IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US
ALL DAY TO FIGURE OUT.

-HOW COMPLICATED COULD IT BE?
-YOU KNOW WHAT?!

IF IT WAS UP TO ME, YOU WOULDN'T
BE IN CHARGE, OKAY?!

-RICKY, THIS IS WHY I SAID
LET US HANDLE IT INSTEAD
OF THESE TWO LOSERS.

-WAIT, GUYS, STOP.

WHO WOULD HAVE THE TIME TO SIT
IN THE SECURITY OFFICE FOR HOURS

AND FIGURE OUT
THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM?

-THEY'D NEED A SET OF KEYS.

-EXACTLY, SO THEN IT CAN'T BE
A STUDENT.

GUYS, WHOEVER MADE THIS PROFILE

WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS
TO THE SCHOOL WHENEVER
THEY WANTED TO.

BRITTANY MUST WORK AT ARCHER.

-AND WHO KNOWS
THE SECURITY SYSTEM BETTER
THAN OFFICER RANDALS?

WE SPLIT OUR TIME UP
THE BEST THAT WE COULD.

WHENEVER SOMEONE
HAD A FREE PERIOD

OR COULD GET AWAY FROM CLASS,
SPORTS, ANYTHING,

THEN THEY WOULD FOLLOW
OFFICER RANDALS.

IF WE CAUGHT HIM
SENDING ONE OF US A TEXT OR
DOING ANYTHING INCRIMINATING,

THEN WE WOULD JUMP ON HIM.

IT MADE PERFECT SENSE.

HE HAD A DEAD-END JOB

WITH PROBABLY
AN EQUALLY DEPRESSING SALARY.

NOBODY GROWS UP ASPIRING TO BE
A SECURITY GUARD.

PEOPLE WAIT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

TO POUNCE ON AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR SITUATION.

[ PHONE BEEPS ]

-[ CHUCKLES ]
DAMN.

-[ KNOCKS ON WINDOW ]

-[ CHUCKLES ]

-LET'S GO.

[ KEYS JANGLE ]

-LOOK, I'M AT RANDALS' HOUSE,
SO...I DON'T KNOW.

GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

[ WIND HOWLING ]

[ PHONE VIBRATES ]

HELLO?

-It's finally your time
to shine, Mr. President.

[ CROWD CHEERING ]

-I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE AT
A GODDAMN FOOTBALL GAME.

-I CAN'T BELIEVE WE THOUGHT
THAT UGLY BASTARD RANDALS

WAS BEHIND BRITTANY TAMMAND.

-AT THIS POINT,
IT COULD BE ANYONE.

[ RADIO STATIC ]
-Miss Sedgewick.

Miss Sedgewick, come in.

Miss Sedgewick, come down
to my office, pl--

[ CLICK ]

-GO AHEAD.

-AT EVERY EVENT, THE
BOOSTER CLUB SELLS CONCESSIONS.

T-SHIRTS AND SWEATSHIRTS

AND JUST STUPID TRINKETS
FOR PARENTS.

SO BEFORE EVERY GAME,
PRINCIPAL DONATO

WITHDRAWS ENOUGH MONEY
FOR CHANGE

AND THEN DEPOSITS THE TAKE
THE NEXT MORNING.

-WERE YOU GONNA STEAL THE CASH?

-NOT EXACTLY.

JACK WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE BOOSTER CLUB

HIS FIRST TWO YEARS AT ARCHER.

HE KNEW DONATO
KEPT THE DEPOSIT SLIPS

IN THE CASH DRAWER
AT EVERY GAME.

WE WEREN'T GONNA STEAL THE CASH.

WHAT BRITTANY WANTED
WAS THE ACCOUNT NUMBER.

-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

-I, UH -- I --

-YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE LEADING
THE CHEER, MR. CLASS PRESIDENT.

GO ON, GET OUT THERE.
-YES, SIR.

[ CROWD CHEERING ]
-YEAH!

[ LAUGHS ]
STAMPEDE!

[ CHUCKLES ]

-AFTER WE GOT
THE ACCOUNT NUMBER,

WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND
BRITTANY AN E-MAIL,

AND SHE WOULD GIVE US
THE NEXT SET OF DIRECTIONS.

BUT WE DECIDED THAT THIS WAS OUR
CHANCE TO SET A TRAP OF OUR OWN

AND FINALLY FIND OUT
WHO SHE REALLY WAS.

[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]

-FAUSTIN!

-OH. UH, I-I HEARD THERE WAS
SOME TROUBLE.

IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

-GUYS.

-SON OF A BITCH.

-[ CHUCKLES ]

ALL RIGHT.

STILL WANT TO KILL ME, CAMERON?

-MM-HMM.

-WHY SHOULDN'T WE JUST TURN YOU
IN TO THE COPS RIGHT NOW, HUH?

-[ LAUGHS ]
TURN ME IN TO T--

FOR WHAT?

FOR YOU STEALING ACCOUNT NUMBERS

AND TRYING TO CREATE
A FAKE IDENTITY?

I-I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

-WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

-YOU THINK I LIKE TEACHING
A BUNCH OF KIDS

HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE?
[ CHUCKLES ]

I'VE HAD THESE
TWO JACKASSES IN MY CLASSES
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.

ALL THEY EVER DO IS BLAB ABOUT
THEIR -- THEIR PLANS TO CON
THE SCHOOL.

WELL, I FINALLY DECIDED
TO PUT 'EM TO THE TEST.

SO FAR, THEY'RE A LOT LESS
INCOMPETENT THAN I SUSPECTED.

-WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?

-I GUESS I'M JUST LUCKY.

CAMERON.
[ LAUGHS ]

DID YOU REALLY THINK

A STUDENT WHO MISSES MORE
CLASSES THAN A KID WITH LEUKEMIA

A LAB WOULDN'T BE A RED FLAG?

YOU GUYS DIDN'T EVEN COVER
YOUR TRACKS.

I WAS JUST THE ONLY ONE
WHO PAID ATTENTION.

-NO, WE'RE DONE WITH YOU.
OKAY?

NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
YOU'RE JUST AS GUILTY AS US.

AND IF YOU DON'T STOP SOON...
WE'RE ALL GONNA GET CAUGHT.

-THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.
-YEAH?

-NO.

YOU SEE, I DON'T HAVE
A LOT TO LOSE.

[ CHUCKLES ]

THIS -- THIS IS MY FUTURE.

SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH
OF...ENTITLED BRATS.

BUT YOUR FUTURES...

...THEY HAVEN'T
EVEN STARTED YET.

GETTING CAUGHT TRYING TO DEFRAUD
A STATE-FUNDED INSTITUTION...

...IS A NICE WAY TO MAKE SURE
THEY NEVER DO.

-RICKY! RICKY.

-NO MORE.

[ SCREAMS ]

-WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

-I JUST THINK THAT...
BRITTANY TAMMAND

IS OWED A LOT OF MONEY
BY THIS SCHOOL.

AND SINCE SHE'S NOT AROUND
TO COLLECT IT,

I THINK I WILL.

-WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

-THE FUNDRAISER
AFTER SHE OFFED HERSELF...

THEY COLLECTED A LOT MORE
THAN THE $60,000 THEY DONATED.

[ LAUGHS ]

AND YOU'RE GONNA GET IT FOR ME.

ALEX ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

POKING AROUND
ON THE PRINCIPAL'S COMPUTER.

-HOW MUCH IS IT?

-ALMOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

BUT DON'T -- DON'T WORRY.

THERE'S A VERY LOW CHANCE
OF BEING TURNED IN FOR
STEALING STOLEN MONEY.

BUT JUST IN CASE, I'M GONNA
LET YOU TAKE CARE OF IT.

HAND IT OVER.

AND THEN YOU'LL NEVER
HEAR FROM ME AGAIN.

-HOW EXACTLY ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

-I -- I'VE GIVEN YOU
ALL THE HELP I CAN.

YOUR FATHER'S A BUSINESSMAN.

FIGURE IT OUT.

[ DOOR OPENS ]
-WHAT?

-MISS SEDGEWICK.

-EXCUSE ME, ALEX.

[ DOOR OPENS ]

-THERE'S NEWS FROM THE HOSPITAL.

-YOU EMBEZZLED MONEY --

[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

YOU EMBEZZLED MONEY
FROM A CHARITY FUND
FOR A SUICIDE VICTIM.

IF THIS LEAKS, OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM
WILL NEVER RECOVER.

YOU BETTER BE THANKING GOD THAT
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW
ABOUT THIS ARE DEAD.

DO WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT BRITTANY'S FAMILY?
-THEY'RE ALL TRAILER TRASH.

I MEAN,
BETWEEN THE ABUSE AT HOME

AND HER SCREWING ANY BOY
THAT SMILED AT HER,

IT'S A MIRACLE SHE DIDN'T --

LOOK, I THOUGHT IF THE SCHOOL
HELD ON TO THE FUNDS,

MAYBE WE COULD MAKE
SOME GOOD COME OF IT.
-[ SCOFFS ]

-IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT ABOUT
THIS, ALEX THOMAS IS GONNA BE
THE LEAST OF YOUR WORRIES.

DO YOU HAVE BRITTANY'S FILES?

-CHILD SERVICES TOOK OUR HARD
COPIES RIGHT AFTER THE SUICIDE,

BUT OUR --
OUR STATE RECORDS HAVE --

-I WANT THEM RIGHT NOW!

-OKAY.
-[ SLAMS LOCKER ]

[ SIGHS ]

-JACK IS, UM --

HE'S TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

-THE SOONER THIS ALL DISAPPEARS,
THE BETTER.

-[ SIGHS ]
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

-I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED,

ALEX THOMAS TAKES TO THE GRAVE.

HOW'S THAT TRANSFER GOING?

-PAPERWORK SHOULD BE READY SOON.
-GREAT.

YOU WANT TO CHECK ON THAT
FOR ME?

-OKAY.

[ DOOR CLOSES ]

-YOU KNOW, I THINK
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN
MY PAPERWORK WILL BE READY.

-I KNOW.
[ ZIPPER UNZIPS ]

NO ONE CAN TELL THE FUTURE,
ALEX.

GUM?

-NO, THANK YOU.
-NO?

OKAY.
[ ZIPPER ZIPS ]

SO, WHY DON'T YOU, UM, TELL ME

WHAT HAPPENED AFTER FAUSTIN
TALKED TO YOU

AT THE FOOTBALL GAME?

-UH, AFTER THE FOOTBALL GAME,

UH, I GUESS WE ALL WENT BACK
TO OUR DAILY LIVES.

-FOCUS.

-WHERE'S RICKY TODAY?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

-HE -- HE MAY HAVE BEEN PUSHED
INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC
ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL.

-[ LAUGHS ]

-WELL, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU TALK TO HIM.

HE CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS
TOO MANY CLASSES.

[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

-IS RICKY HOME?

-HE'S NOT WELL.

-NEITHER AM I.
I STILL NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

WATCH OUT.

-[ SPEAKING RUSSIAN ]

I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL
TO BE PUSHED AROUND BY
THAT ASSHOLE, MAN.

-WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS, RICKY.
-THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
KNOW, WE CAN DO SOMETHING

IF YOU USE
THAT LITTLE BRAIN OF YOURS.
-YOU MEAN, YOU WANT TO --

YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
-NO. ARE YOU CRAZY?

I MEAN, WE DO WHAT WE SHOULD
HAVE DONE WEEKS AGO.
WE TELL THE POLICE.

-ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU HEARD FAUSTIN.

HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ILLEGAL,
RICKY.

WE'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.
COME ON.

-SO, WE MAKE A DEAL.

-A DEAL?
-YEAH.

-GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.
I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL FOR YOU,

YOUR MOMS, YOUR DAD,
THEM LITTLE KIDS, NOBODY!

-OKAY, LOOK.
-STOP ACTING LIKE
A LITTLE BITCH RIGHT NOW!

HEY! MY PARENTS DIDN'T MOVE HERE
TO BE PUSHED AROUND BY
SOME BULLY, OKAY?

I'M GONNA DO WHAT'S RIGHT!

AND YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT, OKAY?

YOU CAN GO NOW.

-CAMERON CALLED US ALL
AND TOLD US ABOUT RICKY.

EVERYONE WAS...SO ON EDGE.

YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT WE
SHOULD LET HIM OFF THE HOOK,

BUT CAMERON DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD BE ENOUGH.

-FAUSTIN.

-CAMERON, YOU SCARED ME.

-YEAH?
-YEAH.

-IT MUST SUCK TO BE YOU.

-YES?

-RICKY'S TALKING ABOUT
GOING TO THE COPS.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

-OH.

UH, OKAY.

OKAY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

DON'T WORRY, I'LL TRY NOT
TO HURT HIM.

-I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.

-YOU DID THE SMART THING.

-YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
AFTER ALL THIS IS OVER,

I PLAN ON DOING
A LOT OF SMART THINGS.

I'D WATCH MY BACK, IF I WAS YOU.

-[ LAUGHS ]

-THE NEXT DAY AFTER SCHOOL,
I WENT TO TALK TO RICKY.

HE WAS DEAD TO CAMERON
AND THE OTHERS,

BUT I THOUGHT
HE DESERVED A WARNING.

YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF HE KNEW
THAT FAUSTIN WAS AFTER HIM,

THEN HE WOULD RECONSIDER
GOING TO THE POLICE.

-RICKY!

WHAT'S GOING ON?

-WE'VE BEEN EVICTED.

-EVICTED, WHY?

-WELL, UH,
WE WERE REPORTED

FOR HAVING SEVEN PEOPLE
IN A TWO-PERSON UNIT.

-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

-MY FATHER HAS FRIENDS
IN CLEVELAND.

WE WILL TRY THERE.

I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE ANY OF
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE, HUH?

-I'M SORRY.
-YEAH.

BEING FORCED TO MOVE

IS BETTER THAN MY PARENTS
SEEING ME IN JAIL, RIGHT?

-[ SPEAKING RUSSIAN ]

-HEY!

[ SPEAKING RUSSIAN ]

-FOR A MOMENT, I ENVIED RICKY.

I MEAN, HIS LIFE
WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN,

BUT...HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT FAUSTIN ANYMORE.

FOR HIM...

IT WAS OVER.

I THOUGHT ABOUT TELLING
THE OTHERS

THAT I WANTED TO GO
TO THE POLICE, TOO.

YOU KNOW, FORCE HIM TO FIND
A WAY TO GET ME OFF THE TEAM.

BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THAT RICKY
HAD A FAMILY TO FALL BACK ON.

IF YOU'RE A PROBLEM
IN FOSTER CARE,

THEY NEVER SEND YOU
TO A BETTER PLACE.

-I HOPE YOU HAVE
GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

-WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT
ALL WEEK.

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
-[ LAUGHS ]

-HASN'T THE STAFF OF ARCHER
TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING?

NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.
-WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

SHORT OF BEING COMPUTER HACKERS
OR HYPNOTISTS,

THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA GET
THE INFORMATION WE NEED WITHOUT
SOMEONE FLAT-OUT TELLING US.

-ARE YOU REALLY WILLING
TO TURN ALL OF US IN?

-MM. NO.

BUT...I WILL DO EVERYTHING
HUMANLY POSSIBLE

TO RUIN YOUR LIVES.

YEAH.

I'LL DEVOTE MYSELF TO IT.

I WILL CALL PROSPECTIVE COLLEGES
AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET IN.

AS FOR YOUR YOUNGER SIBLINGS,

I'LL MAKE SURE ARCHER
IS A LIVING HELL.

I'LL GO AFTER YOUR PARENTS.

LOOK AT RICKY.

ARE YOU WILLING TO LET
YOUR FAMILIES GO THROUGH THAT?

HOW ABOUT SOMETHING WORSE?

JUST FIGURE IT OUT!

-[ CRYING ]

[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

[ SIGHS ]

-I DECIDED TO GO THROUGH
WITH THIS

BECAUSE I SAW HOW RESOURCEFUL
YOU ARE.

IF I WERE YOU...

...I WOULD THINK HARDER

OR PREPARE TO SUFFER
INCONCEIVABLE CONSEQUENCES.

[ DOOR OPENS ]

-WE GOT TO THINK OF SOMETHING.
WE GOT TO THINK QUICK.

-MAYBE DONATO HAS THE PASSWORDS
WRITTEN DOWN SOMEWHERE.

YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
CALL ANOTHER MEETING.
-ARE YOU RETARDED?!

-NOBODY HAS PASSWORDS
TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS
JUST SITTING AROUND, ALEX!

-WHAT IF WE BLACKMAIL HIM?
-BLACKMAIL THE PRINCIPAL?

-YEAH. WE TELL HIM THAT WE
KNOW HE TOOK THE MONEY

FROM BRITTANY TAMMAND'S STUPID
SCHOOL FUND, AND WE FORCE HIM
TO HAND IT OVER.

-HE WOULD JUST HIDE THE MONEY
AND HAVE US ARRESTED.

-WHAT IF WE TAKE OUT FAUSTIN?

-WHAT?
-ARE YOU CRAZY?

WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

-AFTER ALL THIS SHIT,
YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL?!

WHAT IF I WAIT IN THE BACK
OF THIS CAR AND I SLIT OPEN
HIS THROAT?

-STOP!
-HOW'S THAT FOR A PLAN?!

-STOP, CAMERON!
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING

THAT COULD GET US
LIFE IN PRISON.

-NOT IF WE DON'T GET CAUGHT.
-PEOPLE LIKE YOU ALWAYS
GET CAUGHT.

[ LAUGHS ]

-AND PIECES OF SHIT LIKE YOU
THREE WILL ALWAYS BE VICTIMS.

MOVE.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

-CAMERON, COME ON.
-SCREW OFF, JACK.

-ALL RIGHT, FINE, BAIL ON US!

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

[ HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS ]

-MAYBE WE JUST...
TALK TO OUR PARENTS

AND SEE IF THEY'RE WILLING
TO PAY FAUSTIN OFF.
-NO, NO.

IF MY PARENTS FIND OUT --
-YOU THINK YOUR CONSTANT
BITCHING

IS GONNA SOLVE
ANY PROBLEMS, CARLA?!

[ VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES ]

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

[ VEHICLE DEPARTS ]
-[ COUGHING ]

-WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

WE JUST HAD NO IDEA
HOW TO DO IT.

WE'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HOW TO TRANSFER MONEY

FROM A SCHOOL BANK ACCOUNT
TO OUR FAKE ONE?

EVERYONE WAS JUST FREAKED OUT,

SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS.

-NEW DEAL.

TO COMBAT THE GREAT DEPRESSION.

-ARE YOU OKAY?

-I'M MAKING SURE SHE'S OKAY!

-HEY, DON'T YOU -- GET BACK HERE
AND SIT DOWN, JACK!

-SORRY, SIR.
-NO!

-REALLY?! YOU THINK SO?!

-COME ON, LET ME IN!

-CARLA, OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR!

-BOYS SHOULDN'T BE
IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM!

IS GOING ON IN HERE?

YOUR BEHAVIOR IS COMPLETELY --
-[ RETCHING ]

-MM. OH, GOD.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?
-UH...

-IS SHE PREGNANT?
-NO, SHE'S JUST REALLY SICK.

SHE SAID IT'S SOMETHING
FROM THE CAFETERIA.

-OH. ALL RIGHT.

I'M -- I'M GETTING THE NURSE.

-WE'LL GET HER CLEANED UP.
-MM-HMM.

-CARLA, YOU OKAY?

-I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
-YOU SHOULD CRAWL UNDER.

-CARLA, COME ON!

-[ CRYING ]

I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

[ CRYING ]
-WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

COME ON.

LET'S GO TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE,
ALL RIGHT?

LET'S GET YOU CLEANED UP.

YOU THINK SHE'LL BE OKAY?

-SHE'LL HAVE
A ROUGH COUPLE DAYS.

-I CAN'T HELP THINKING...

...HOW MUCH EASIER MY LIFE
WOULD BE IF SHE WAS NEVER
A PART OF IT.

WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET OUT
OF THIS.

-ALEX.

I WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT THIS
IN YOUR MAILBOX.

-THANKS.
-THE SCHEDULE'S UP FOR NEXT WEEK

WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE
TO CHECK IT OUT.

TO STEAL

[ HIP-HOP MUSIC CONTINUES ]

[ MUSIC CONTINUES ]

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

-WE ACTUALLY DID IT.

AFTER WEEKS OF WORRYING
THAT OUR LIVES WERE OVER,

WE HAD THE KEYS TO OUR FREEDOM.

-PRINCIPAL DONATO, CAN YOU
COME MEET ME IN THE LIBRARY?

PRINCIPAL DONATO?

-Sure, I'll be right there.

[ DOOR OPENS ]

-WHAT'S GOING ON?

-I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

I NEED YOU TO LOG INTO THE
SCHOOL'S AUXILIARY ACCOUNT.

HMM. INTERESTING.

-ALL RIGHT?

-OKAY, THANK YOU.

-FUCK YOU!
-HEY, LET IT GO, CAMERON.

-NO! WE'RE NOT GONNA LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

[ EXPLOSION ]

THEY FOUND ME IN THE HALLWAY,
AND THEY TOOK ME TO THE MEDICS.

I TOLD THE POLICE --

I TOLD THEM WHAT
THEY NEEDED TO KNOW.

-WELL, YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM
THE WHOLE STORY.

YOU WERE PUSHED TO
YOUR BREAKING POINT
BY A VERY SICK MAN,

BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU WERE INNOCENT.

WHAT?

YOU STOLE, CHEATED, LIED.

IF A JURY HEARD
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME

AND SAW THAT YOU
WERE THE ONLY SURVIVOR...

YOU WOULD GO TO JAIL.

-I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

-PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES, ALEX.

-I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS THING
WAS CONFIDENTIAL.

-DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT A JURY
WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU?

-WE WERE VICTIMS.
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

-I CAN PROVE
THAT YOU ROBBED THE SCHOOL
OF A HALF-MILLION DOLLARS.

[ CHUCKLES ]
DIDN'T YOU?

YOU'RE PATHETIC.

-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME?

-I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
TO YOU.

-SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
[ SNIFFLES ]

-I WANT YOU TO LEAVE...

AND NEVER COME BACK.

I WANT YOU TO NEVER SPEAK OF THE
EVENTS OF THESE LAST FEW WEEKS

TO ANYONE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

BECAUSE IF YOU DO,
I WILL COME AFTER YOU,

AND NEXT TIME,
I WILL NOT BE SO GENEROUS.

YOUR TRANSFER
SHOULD BE READY NOW.

-SIGN RIGHT HERE.

I'VE ARRANGED A NICE NEW HOME
FOR YOU IN A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM.

RIGHT HERE, PLEASE.

YOU -- YOU HAVE A RIDE HOME?

A CAR, YEAH?

UM, WELL, I THINK
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN PUT THIS
WHOLE THING BEHIND YOU SOON.

GOOD LUCK, ALEX.

SO, UH, ALL IS WELL?

-ALEX THOMAS
WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AGAIN.

-WELL, THANK GOD FOR THAT.

WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

-WE NEED TO DISSOLVE
THE ACCOUNT.

SO, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO PUT IT.

-[ SIGHS ]

-THIS IS THE FILE
ON BRITTANY YOU ASKED FOR.

-OH, THANK YOU.

[ COMPUTER DINGS ]

-"MESSAGE
FROM BRITTANY TAMMAND."

-WHAT?

-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

WHO SENT THIS?

-IS THAT BRITTANY?

-UH-HUH

-I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

HE TOLD ME.

[ CRIES SOFTLY ]

IT SOUNDS SO STUPID
WHEN I SAY IT OUT LOUD.

HE WAS THE MOST POPULAR GUY
AT SCHOOL,

AND HE TOLD ME
THAT HE LOVED ME.

[ CRIES ]

HE WAS --
HE WAS THE CLASS PRESIDENT,

AND I JUST DIDN'T THINK
HE'D LIE TO ME.

BUT AFTERWARDS,
HE -- HE STOPPED CALLING ME.

AND THEN -- AND THEN
HIS GIRLFRIEND FOUND OUT,

AND THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
TURNED AGAINST ME.

THEN THESE -- THESE TWO GUYS
FROM MY SCIENCE CLASS,

RICKY AND CAMERON...

THEY TRIED TO MAKE ME --
ME DO THINGS WITH THEM.

-OH, MY GOD.
-[ CRIES ]

AND I TRIED TO TELL
THE TEACHER...

...BUT HE TOLD ME THAT --

THAT I-I SHOULDN'T ACT
LIKE A SLUT

IF I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE.

I HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS.

I WANTED TO DIE.

I WALKED AS FAR AS I COULD

UNTIL THE WATER
WAS TOO DEEP...

AND THEN I SWAM FURTHER.

AND THEN I JUST LET GO.

BY LETTING GO OF EVERYTHING,
IT BECAME SO CLEAR.

I HAD TO DIE
IN ORDER TO LIVE...

[ GASPING ]

...SO I COULD MAKE THEM PAY.

-JESUS!
-OH, MY GOD!

-THESE HATERS WILL PAY FOR
THE LIFE OF BRITTANY TAMMAND.

-OH, MY GOD. WAIT.

WHO'S BRITTANY?
ALEX?

-I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE.
-ALEX, WHO IS BRITTANY?

-IF SHE HADN'T KILLED HERSELF,
NO ONE WOULD EVEN KNOW
WHO SHE WAS.

-YOUR BOYFRIEND WOULD KNOW
WHO SHE WAS.

-IT WAS BRITTANY!
-WHAT? WHAT?

-BRITTANY.
-WHO'S BRITTANY?

-WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

-BRITTANY TAMMAND IS OWED
A LOT OF MONEY BY THE SCHOOL.

-YOU EMBEZZLED MONEY
FROM A CHARITY FUND

FOR A SUICIDE VICTIM.

-JUST FIGURE IT OUT!

-NOBODY HAS PASSWORDS
TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNT
JUST SITTING AROUND, ALEX!

-THEN RICKY HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA
OF BUYING SOME TRANSMITTER

THAT WOULD GIVE US A RUNNING LOG
OF EVERYTHING TYPED INTO
THE SCHOOL COMPUTERS.

-THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TO
THE STORY WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

-PEOPLE WAIT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
TO POUNCE ON AN OPPORTUNITY

THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR SITUATION.

-I THINK I JUST
FIGURED OUT HOW TO STEAL
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

-UM, GO TO -- GO TO
THAT BANK ACCOUNT AGAIN.

OPEN THE BANK ACCOUNT!

HURRY.

HURRY!

[ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]

-IT'S ALL GONE.
SHIT, IT'S EMPTY.

-STUPID!

"BODY NOT RECOVERED."

IT'S HER.
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

-SHE'S GETTING AWAY!

[ PHONE BEEPS ]

-RANDALS, REPORT TO THE MAIN
OFFICE IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE.

-BRITTANY!!

[ GUNSHOTS ]

[ GUNSHOT ]

[ THUD ]

-[ Crying ] NO! NO! NO!

OH, MY GOD!

[ SOBBING ]

-NO ONE EVEN NOTICED.

SHE JUST WALKED INTO THE LAKE...

AND THEN SHE WAS GONE.
