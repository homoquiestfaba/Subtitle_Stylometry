MAN:
Here's your key.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Hello.

[TRAVIS WHISTLES]

Oh. Uh...

My bad. They gave me
the wrong key.

Not your bad.
We stay a little long.

We're now leaving soon.

Okay.

What the fuck, guy?
ANKA: It's okay, Viktor.

He's here for the room.

TRAVIS:
Yeah.

Yeah.

You're on vacation.

Uh, yeah.

I've actually never
been here before. It's--
It's a pretty cool town.

Where are you guys from?

Ukraine.
Cool.

Now that he kidnapped me I don't
know where we're gonna end up.

You're so dirty. Ha-ha-ha.

[ANKA MOANS]

Enough. You're gonna
wear me out.

Come.

Have a drink with us.

Uh...

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's vodka, man.
Don't be shy. I

Come on, man.

TRAVIS:
Yeah. You know, it's--

Well, actually I've got some beer.
Do you guys drink beer?

It's still cold.

[BACKPACK UNZIPS]

VIKTOR:
Beer, huh?

TRAVIS:
Yeah.

I like this guy.

He brings party with him, huh?

Come.

There you go.

There we go.
We do a cheers now, huh?

Sure.
Nazdrovia.

Nazdrovia.
ANKA: Nazdrovia.

Okay. I go take shower,
then we go.

Oh, shit.

Fuck. I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to--

No. For what?

Never mind. It's human nature.

I'm looking everything that moves.
Right.

Okay.
She's hot, right?

Yeah, she's pretty hot.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, we were in this club,
crazy chicks. You go there,
you're gonna score.

I have club card for you.
Oh, no.

No, no, no. You're gonna go
in there, man. Connection.

Anka, I need that club's card.

Oh, hold on. I lose it.
Okay.

Baby, I need
the club card.

[SHOWER RUNNING]

Anka!

Shit. Something's
fucking wrong?

What the fuck? Anka!

Hey, get in here!
We got a problem, man.

Anka.

Talk. Talk.

Hey, get in here, man.
Come on!

I think she's having a heart attack
or something. Talk to me!

What the fuck you doing, man?
Get in here!

Anka, talk to me.

Come on, man.
We gotta get her to a doctor.

Help me, man.
Call a fucking doctor!

Hey! Come on, man!
What the fuck? Help me!

Call the fucking doctor!
What the fuck you standing there?

What the fuck you doing, man?
Get in here!

What--?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What is going on?

Anka.


[CELL PHONE BEEPS]

Yeah, we're good to go.

Here.

Keep her dry. If she gets sick,
we'll have to discount her.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Come on.

Save that shit for
the honeymoon, please.

Oh, the best man.

You know,
since I am the best man,
which clearly I am,

you know, why is it that
she's marrying you?

You had your chance
freshman year.

What ever happened?
SCOTT: I don't know.

You were a man-whore?

Not in front of her.
Thanks for that.

Come on, let's go.

Again. More of this.

You get to kiss this jackhole
for the rest of our life.

This weekend, he's mine.

Such a dick.
Don't let him bang any strippers.

SCOTT:
What?

There are no strippers
in Palm Springs.

Well, there's no decent strippers
in Palm Springs, all right.

Once I get him out on the course,

the only thing he's gonna
be banging is five irons, Ames.

Okay.

I'll call you from the hotel.
Be safe.

All right.

A little breakfast?
No. I'm good. It's a little early.

Even for you.
This is nothing, man.

In a couple of hours,
you are gonna be doing blow

off some hot stripper's ass.

You said there were no good
strippers in Palm Springs.

There aren't.

We're not going to Palm Springs,
are we?

[CLANKING IN DISTANCE]

Holy shit.

Holy shit.

What the fuck is this?

Anka.

Anka.

Anka.

Get up!

Anka!

Hey! Who the fuck

What the fuck you doing?

What the fuck you want
with us?

Anka!

Hey!

Aah! Aah!

VIKTOR: Don't touch her!
Aah! Aah!

VIKTOR:
Come to me!

Come to me, motherfuckers!

Who are you? Where--?

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]

Where the fuck are you taking her?

Aah! I don't wanna die!

Anka! I'm gonna come for you!

ANKA:
Let go!

Let go!

No!

VIKTOR:
Anka!

Anka, I'm gonna come
for you!

All you motherfuckers
are gonna die!

ANKA:
No!

[KOVAS' "READY" PLAYING]

â™ª I hope you ready, ready
I hope you fee! it â™ª

â™ª I hope you ready, ready
No, no, don't be sweet â™ª

â™ª I hope you ready, ready
Ready, ready, ready, ready â™ª

â™ª Tonight is the night â™ª

â™ª I hope you ready, ready

â™ª I hope you ready, ready

Ha, ha!

â™ª Here comes the bride â™ªâ™ª

[MIKE & SCOTT LAUGHING]

What's up?
CARTER: How's the leg?

JUSTIN: It's okay.
Carter.

How are you, Mike?
I'm glad you made it.

Good to be here.

How you doing? Thanks for coming.
Wouldn't miss it.

We're not here for you.
We're here for this.

Bounce it.
Up and down, north to south.

How great is this?
Tits and ass at your table.

I could get
all the stripper action I want,

look my wife in the face
and say I never went
to the club. Genius.

Sit down. Let's do some damage.
Okay. Cool.

â™ª I hope you ready, ready â™ª

MIKE:
Ha-ha-ha! Look at that.
Spade and neutered. What's up?

â™ª I hope you ready, ready
Ready, ready â™ª

MIKE:
Yeah. Dude, some come for
the free booze, I come not to lose.

Pay me, motherfucker.


MIKE:
Oh, yeah. Winner, winner,
chicken dinner, bitches.

â™ª I hope you ready â™ªâ™ª

JUSTIN:
This whole place
is a lab experiment.

Look. Look at it.
There are no windows.

There are no clocks on the walls.

They pump oxygen in here
to keep you awake.

They give you free booze
to keep you drunk.

They parade women
in front of you on top of that.

It's all just to take your money.
Man, this place is evil incarnate.

Yeah, maybe so,
but not when you're winning.

Mikey, you're looking
a little light over there.

Oh, me? I'm golden.
It's you I'm worried about.

Oh, God. Don't start this shit.

Wait, what shit?

His "don't do it" speech.
I've heard every version of it.

You're gonna tell him
not to get married.
You don't want him to.

You're married, you know that, right?
Yeah. I know.

And it's a living hell, Carter.
Seriously.

Marriage is nothing
but a three-ring circus.

Engagement ring, wedding ring,
suffering. You'll see.

Yeah, but it's gonna be
different for Scotty.

Really? Interesting.
How exactly?

Because he's not
marrying a bitch.

Oh, see, there it is.
He comes in with a:

I am getting married
in one week, and you
and your lovely wife

are gonna be there.
My lovely fat wife. Yes, we will.

Okay, time to go.
What? What are you doing? I'm hot.

That's why they sent over
the cooler. Asians are bad luck.

You make good
firecrackers, though.

That is just some racist bullshit.

I'm sorry, man.
He did not mean that.

All right. So, what now?

JUSTIN:
Got Cirque du Soleil tickets.

Oh, so you're not only disabled,
you're also gay.

Sometimes.

But it's not gonna matter too much

because Scotty is getting
seriously eye fucked

by the girls at the progressive slots.
See them?

Dude, they are hot.
And I bet you they
hate their fathers.

JUSTIN: Yes.
What are you doing? Don't start.

I'm not doing anything.
Justin, do your thing.
Limp on over.

Nothing wets a pussy
like this hardware, huh?

Pity fuck is still a fuck.

That's true.

Hey, guys.

I'm Kendra.
I'm Nikki.

Hi. I'm Scott.
This is Carter, Mike and Justin.

Mike.
So you girls wanna join the party?

Not much of a party.

We're just kind of getting started.
We have a Jacuzzi.

It's in our room,
if you guys wanted
to head up there.

Smooth.

You guys have
any better ideas?

We know a place,
but it's off the Strip.

Yeah, it's way off the Strip.

I don't know, it might be
too much for some nice
boys from the suburbs.

NIKKI:
It's a little freaky.

Do you like freaky?

We like freaky.
We've always been
into that sort of thing.

What about you?

Um...

KENDRA:
Do you like freaky?

Yeah.

Yeah, sure.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC
PLAYING ON RADIO]

Hey, listen, on the radio here,

I love this guy.
I have his records.

But do you think you could turn
it down a couple of notches

so we can hear ourselves?

Thank you.

Yeah. Do you think
that those girls are pros?

What, hookers? Pfft.
No, tennis pros.

Who cares? I wanna poke them
in their vaginas with Justin's crutch.

Go check their oil with my tongue.
Know what I mean?

A little low down there?
You need a fill-up?

Hey, you know your meter's
not working, man.

You high rollers pay me 20 bucks,
I call it even.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

SCOTT: You sure this is right?
CARTER: I think that's it back there.

The GPS shows
it should be right here.

You see a club?
I don't see a club.

All I see is a bacon factory.

What are you afraid of?
Think I'm gonna drive
you to the alley

where my friends steal your money
and cut your heads off?

CARTER:
Okay, time to go.

JUSTIN: All right.
MIKE: Okay.

SCOTT:
That is way off the Strip, all right.

MIKE: Are you sure this is it?
JUSTIN: It's the address she gave us.

SCOTT:
Those girls were right.
This place is pretty freaky.

What you want?

We're here for the party.

You on the list?

Yeah. Nikki and Kendra sent us?

Oh.

So you're that deal?

What does that mean?

It means
you're gonna have a nice time.

Come on in. Down the hall.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

JUSTIN:
Dude, this place feels fucked.

I think we should go.

What, go check out Cirque du Soleil?
Sure.

Your vagina's hanging out.

What?
Yeah.

How did that get out?
Second time.

My goodness.

Well, we're here.
Might as well see
what it's all about.

"Might as well see
what it's all about."

Dude, we're not going
anywhere.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Oh, fuck.
That's me.

Fuck, dude.
It's Amy.

You probably
wanna take that.

You're practically married.
Guess what I do.

When I'm away from my wife,
I turn off my phone.
She can't call, can't text,

can't make me send
a photo of where I'm at
because she's insecure.

That's why your marriage sucks.
She put on 30 pounds, so...

Amy, hey.

You said you would call
when you got tothe hotel.

I know, l'm sorry.

Um, look, we're just walking in
somewhere, so I'm-- I gotta go.

So l'll call you when I get back
to the hotel tonight?

Scott.
Yeah?

Should I be worried
about you?

No.

Please don't do this.

You have nothing to worry about,
okay? I love you.

Okay.

I love you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Guys?

Very funny.

Hello?

Hello?

[DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE]

SCOTT:
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

Stop it! I can't fucking breathe!

Where the fuck are you taking me?

Ugh! Let me go!

â™ª And dances and dances â™ªâ™ª

You guys set me up

Hey, it's what they paid us
to do.

So you're a...?

What do they
call you now?

Oh, this week, "escorts."

Are you disappointed?

No.

Good.

Let's go.

Where?

The champagne room.

SCOTT:
You are gonna get me
in so much trouble.

WOMAN:
Hey, I'm Angela.

Hey.

I'm, uh-- I'm Justin.

I'm sorry.

Gotta get back to my friend.
Sure.

Just so you know, darling,
this thing stays hard all night.

Who lit the fuse on her tampon?

MIKE:
Tampon.

What is wrong with your friend?

A lot.

You're too sweet for her.

[MIKE BELCHES]

So why don't you stay here?

I want you to wait for me

because I don't know how long
your friend's gonna be, okay?

You ready?
Mm-hm.

I just came
in my pants.

That's not my wife.

That's not my wife.

Shh. Don't tell anyone.

Can we just--?

Slow down, slow down,
slow down.

Slow is cool.

We've got the room for an hour.
Yeah.

No, no. Um...

No. I'm just thinking
maybe we could just talk.

Talk?
Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

Like, um, are you from Vegas?


Is that what
you wanna talk about?

No, no. It's just that, um...

No. It's just that, uh...

Oh. Oh. Is--?
Is this your first time?

No. I'm--

I'm getting married.

Not tonight.

Not tonight.
No, not tonight.

Please, Kendra. Kendra.
Wait.

Just relax, okay?

Nobody's gonna know anything.

Yeah. I know, I know.

No, but look--
Look. Look, I was--
I was unfaithful last year.

All right, my fiancÃ©e found out
and I almost lost her.

All right, I realize how fucking lame
this sounds, I do, but I just...

I told myself that I wasn't gonna
be that guy anymore.

Hey, I get it.

It's cool.
Nothing has to happen.

We can just hang out.

At least, here.

Have another drink.

MIKE:
Ahh.

Scotty. I just found out
who killed JFK.
You wanna know?

You still have your clothes on.
You are slow, you little bitch.

What's up?

Somebody threw up in our room so--
Somebody?

Yeah.

Yeah, you did.
Hey, you can't keep a secret.

Close your mouth, open your legs.
Close your mouth, open your legs.
Ha-ha-ha.

Are you okay?
No.

No. I need to get some air.

KENDRA:
Okay.

Air is good. Air is good.
Get some H2O.

No, that's water.

Great.
You're hot, but I need you to leave.

Bachelor boy
finally woke up, huh?

JUSTIN:
Yeah. I think the warm piss
in his pants did it.

CARTER:
We thought you were dead.

SCOTT:
Just dead drunk.

Ugh. God.


You know, I would have
carried you to bed,

but you're fucking
huge and I've got
a gimpy leg, so...

Heh. Last thing I remember,
I was throwing up and
got locked out of the club.

How did you get back here?
You were here when we got in.

Um...

The cabbie.
The cabbie with the broken meter.

Oh. Did you at least get laid?
No. But she was a cutie.

That pisses me off because
I paid that whore good money
to rock your world. In advance.

SCOTT:
Where's Mike? Did he pass out
in the tub covered in his puke again?

Yeah, probably. But not here.
He went home with that, uh,
Nikki girl.

He hasn't resurfaced.

Did you try calling him?

Dude, his phone's
in the sex dead zone.

He's miles from home.
Remember?

It's not gonna be on
until we get back to Phoenix.

MIKE: You've reached Mike.
Voice mail.

I'm in Vegas. Leave me alone!
Hey, Mikey, it's Scott.

Turn your phone on, man.
We're looking for you.

I wouldn't worry too much
about Mike. He knows
what time our flight is.

It's the spell of Vegas, man.
Like I said, it is pure evil.

Looks like Mikey was
getting the bachelor party
you were supposed to.

SCOTT:
Yeah.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What the fuck is this?

What the fuck did you guys
put in that champagne?

It's got a nasty aftertaste.

I know I ate some fucking pussy.
What is this?

All right, I get it. I got you, Scott.
Now you got me. Ha, ha.

Come on, guys.
What the fuck?

Shit.
VIKTOR: Yeah.

You are in the shit.
Who the fuck are you?

What are you doing?
What does it look like?

I'm not gonna die in here.
Who said anything about dying?

Come to me, motherfucker!
What is going on?

Come on, you motherfucker.

Argh!
MIKE: What is he doing to him?

Oh, my God!
Oh, my fucking God!

Get the fuck away from me!

What the fuck is going on?

There's our snaky

Is this a fucking joke?
What the fuck?

Fuck you!

MIKE:
Please. I didn't do anything.
This is a mistake.

Guys, please!

My name is Mike Malloy
from Arizona. Let me go.

Shut your mouth.
Take it like a man.

Fucking asshole.
Fucking Jes--

Let me the fuck out of here.
Who the fuck are you?

Who the fuck are you?
Get the fuck off of me!

No, no! Aah!


This is fucking bad.

Please. Plea-- Fucking please.

What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

Is this a fucking joke?
Oh, yeah.

And the punch line
is a killer.

My friends have money.
We have money. We can pay you.

We can pay you.
You've already been paid for.


What the fuck is he
talking about? What?

What do you mean "paid for"?
What the fuck is going on?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Who the fuck are these people?

No!

I have a wife.
I have a daughter, a son.
They're 6 and 4.

Begging for family.
One minute, 58 seconds.

[CROWD APPLAUDING]


Hey, Mike,
we're still looking for you.

Hey, Mike,
we're still looking for you.

We're starting to freak out
a little bit. Call us back.

Maybe we should
call his wife.

That sounds like
a very good idea.

"Have you seen Mike?
We left him at a party
last night

with a professional escort
and he disappeared."
Good idea.

What do you suggest?

He was probably up
all night dicking that girl.
Give him a couple of hours.

We're just worried about him.
Well, I'm not.

I mean, look around, huh?

Everywhere you look,
there are coeds and milfs

and cougars, you know?
What are we gonna do?

Look for him? Where?
Where did you find those girls?

It's Vegas. It's not hard.

Was it some kind of service
you called?

Yeah, it was 1-800-WHORES,
man.

I know how to find him.

How?

I totally forgot. That girl, Nikki,
she gave me her card.

That's her e-mail address.
We need a street address.

Yeah. No, it's called cyber stalking.

I'm pretty good at it.

JUSTIN:
Hey, Nikki, it's Justin,

the guy with the crutch
from last night.

We're looking for our friend.
We're wondering if you know
where he is.

Please call me back. Thank you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[DOG GROWLING
AND BARKING]

She definitely lives
in a trailer park.

This is a classic
Vegas fucking fairy tale.

What number is it?
Uh, W17.

And where is that?
You know, I don't know, Carter.

I don't have a white-trash
locator on my phone.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[BABY CRYING NEARBY]

CARTER:
Where is it?
Is it one of these?

JUSTIN:
I think it's further up.

CARTER:
Are we getting warmer?

Is this the one?
Yeah.

Look, I don't think anybody's here.


SCOTT:
Hello?

Nikki? Mike?

No. Mm-mm.

Your show, man.

This is definitely
a bad idea.

[BOTTLES CLATTERING]

Okay.

Are you coming?
Uh, no.

I'll stay out here
and keep watch, I guess.

God, it fucking reeks
in here.

Mike?

Hello?

Jesus.

Does it look like he's been here?

I don't know.

I guess it would explain
all these strap-ons, though.

He's obviously
not here anymore.

Let's get the fuck out of here.


What the hell was that?

SCOTT:
Justin.

Motherfuckers, get down!

All of you,
on your fucking knees now!

It's me, Scott.

I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

We need to talk to Nikki.
So you broke into her house.

I think this is actually a trailer.

Shut up!

Okay, okay! Chill, chill!

[GUN COCKS]

Don't fuck with us.
Why are you looking for Nikki?

Our friend Mike
never came home last night.

She was the last one
we saw him with.

And you think
that he just shacked up with her.

He's such an all-star lay,
she had to take him home.

Kendra, look, he wouldn't
call us back. We don't know
what's going on.

CARTER:
This is obviously a scam
to get more money out of us.

How much do you want?
What about you, meth mouth?

SCOTT:
Carter, shut up!

Look, we're sorry that we broke in.
We just wanna talk to her,

see what she knows about Mike.
You don't get it, do you?

I can't ask her.

Nikki didn't come home
last night.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Tacky hooker.

Too on-the-nose.

[NIKKI GRUNTING]

Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

Much better.

Aah!
Shh.

What do you think?

Rah, rah, rah.


Shut the fuck up.


TRAVIS:
Get it done.

[SCREAMS THEN SPITS]

What the fuck are you doing?

What are you doing?

[SPEAKING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

Nice and sweet, like you.

Wh--?

Help.

[SPEAKING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

[NIKKI SCREAMS]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Help!

Come, mama.

Help me!

What are you doing
with that?


No!

Please. Help!


[SPEAKING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

NIKKI:
No. No.

What are you gonna do with that?

What are you doing?

What are you gonna do?


Stop it!




How do I know
your friend didn't hurt her?

Because I know Mike.
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

You know what this town
taught me?

Nobody knows anybody.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, right?

There's always
that one son of a bitch

who doesn't realize
that this is all for show.

It's not real.

I've been saying that all along.

Um, how are we gonna
find them?

We're gonna go back to the club.
Start at the beginning,
retrace their steps.

No. I think we should call the cops.
KENDRA: No.

People disappear
off the Strip every night.

Police don't consider it
a missing person till
they've been gone a week.

Look, we're gonna find them.

There's no "we" here.

I just wanna find my friend.

Ooh.

You're still fucking hot.

You are dead fucking sexy.

Oh, shit.

Nasty little bitch.


Say "deep throat."

[CAMERA CLICKS]

That's good.
That's really good, babe.

That's nice work.
What do you think?

Hm? Don't you think?
Yeah, me too.

I'll see you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

JUSTIN:
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Guys, guys. Hey.

I got a text from Mike.
SCOTT: What is he saying?

Uh, he says,
"Sorry to disappear on you.
Crashed all day."

Where is he?
VVhere's Nikki?

Hold on, I'm asking.

Where are you?

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

Ah. "I'm with Nikki.

She's sleeping.
Battery dying."

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

Mm. Check it out.

God, Nikki,
what did you do?

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

Hey, wait.

"Meet me here.
Room 9, ASAP."

Do you know where that is?
Fremont district.

Okay, well,
let's go kick his ass.

I'm gonna fucking kill him.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Are you coming, gimpy?

I think I'm gonna save myself
for the Special Olympics.

My leg's killing me.

Go get that asshole
and let's get out of here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey, Mikey.

Mike, are you in there or what?

Mikey?

KENDRA:
Nikki?

Well, at least we
know they were here.
This is Nikki's purse.

[SCOTT SIGHS]

What the hell is he up to?

Here's his phone.

And a note.

"Guys, we stepped out.
Have a beer and chill."

At least we know
he hasn't lost his manners.

Hey, Mikey?

SCOTT:
So should we just
wait here for them?

KENDRA:
What if they don't come back?

SCOTT:
I'm sorry this all got so fucked up.

As much as I'd love to have
a moment, I'm just--

CARTER:
Oh, fuck.

What the fuck? Go, go.

KENDRA:
No!

[CELL PHONE BEEPING]

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey.
Whoa. What the fuck?

I'm sorry, man. I, uh--

You Justin?
You scared the shit out of me.

I know. I'm really sorry about that,
but Mike is looking for you.

He's not in there?
He's at a bar right down the street.

Too drunk to walk.
He asked me to come get you.

Okay. He did?

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay, well, let me call him.
Cool.

Oh, one more thing.
What--? Ow! Oh, fuck!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Bet you thought that was
fucking hilarious, didn't you?

Look, you motherfuckers
are making a mistake!

Huh? You're making
a fucking mistake!
You know that, don't you?

You have no fucking idea
what you're doing!

Big fucking mistake!

That's what they all say.
CARTER: Suck my dick, you faggot.

SCOTT:
Where the fuck are we?

Who's doing this to us?

You're gonna meet them
soon enough.

When it's your turn,
they'll come for you.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

Come here, you motherfuckers!

CARTER:
Hey! Hey!

Fucking tough guys!

Come over here!

Where is Anka?

JUSTIN:
I don't know what's going on.
I don't-- Hey, no! No!

No.
CARTER: Shit! Justin, Justin! Justin!

JUSTIN:
Why are they doing this to me?

SCOTT:
What is going on here?

Where are you taking him?

That was your friend?

That was my friend. Who are you?

You should've said
goodbye to him, then.

CARTER:
Hey! Hey!

Hey, you motherfucker, stop.

Stop. Come here.

GUARD: Wait your turn, Ã©se.
Yeah, it's my fucking turn right now.

What is that?

GUARD:
Shit, why didn't you say something?

Come on. Hurry up, let's go.

Back up.
No.


Carter, what the fuck
is going on? What is
that all about?

It's Elite Hunting Club.

What the fuck does that mean?

It means members only.

SCOTT:
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

Where the fuck are you going?

You can't leave me in here!

Carter!

Carter!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Get Mr. McMullin
his Jack and Coke.

You can hold the Coke.

Accept my apologies
for any inconvenience.

Inconvenience?
That's what you call that?

Those guys were gonna
drag me away like a piece of meat.

It must have been
a unique sensation for you.

I'm glad to see you're enjoying this.

FLEMMING:
We are professionals.

There's a reason we kidnap
people who won't be missed.

Your special request has caused
more than a few inconveniences.

CARTER:
That was never my intention.

You know that. I'm a good client.

Top-tier client.

Which is why I entertained the idea
in the first place.

Well, let's just agree that mistakes
were made on both sides.

How do we move on?

The females will make up
for the added expense.

And the others?

Your friends?

Collateral damage.

Do you have a problem with that?

If you do,
I could call the home office.

They don't like to hear
about problems.

They were always more
his friends than mine.

So are we good?

Drink up.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.


[CROWD CHEERING]

WOMAN [OVER SPEAKERS]:
That was a total of nine arrows
until termination.

Congratulations
to players five and 11.

TRAVIS:
Showtime.

VIKTOR:
I have big surprise for that
cattle prod motherfucker.

What the fuck they doing
to her?

They took my woman.

[VIKTOR CRYING]

They took my Anka.

These fucking people.

Who knows
what they're doing to her?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

She was my life.

She was my everything.

I'm getting married next week.

Well, at least you didn't
get married last week.

And why is that?

Because your woman
would be a widow now.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

GUARD:
Let's go, pretty boy.

Fuck you.

GUARD:
Oh, that wasn't a request.

[SCOTT YELLING]

Okay!

Scott!

Okay, okay!

KENDRA:
Where the fuck
are you taking him?

Fuck.

[GUARD GRUNTING]

Come on, pretty boy.
It's just a fucking jacket.

SCOTT:
All right, all right, all right.

That's a nice tux.

Don't bother returning it.
Enjoy your honeymoon.


[DANIEL LENZ'S "ALIENS"
PLAYING]

WOMAN [OVER SPEAKERS]:
Welcome, members,

to the Elite Hunting Club's
main event, a very special kill.

Enjoy the show.

Don't get up. It's fine.
SCOTT: What?

What is this?

What is this, Carter?

This? This is actually
a really fucking cheap tuxedo.

I have this very special
custom job I was gonna
wear to the wedding.

Okay.

I guess now
I'll wear it to your funeral.

What are you saying?

CARTER: Ho, ho, ho. I didn't
think they'd be able to find it,
but they did. Recognize these?

This is really great.

Do you know
what these are?

Those are the very expensive
German kitchen knives

that Amy registered for
at Bloomie's.

I'm glad they're here

because I actually used a knife
very much like this one

to kill a girl at the club in Macau.

I skinned her alive.
It took me six hours.

What kind of sick fuck are you?

But the problem

that I keep running into

is that the rush
just isn't there anymore.

I needed to up the ante a bit.
I needed to kill someone
who mattered.

How are you gonna get away with it?
You can't just make me disappear!

That's what I pay these people for.
What?

What, to kill your
fucking friends?

Where are Mike and Justin?

What did you do with them?
That was actually a mistake.

That was
a legitimate mistake.

That Mike was in the wrong place
at exactly the right time.

And Justin...

The poor bastard.
He didn't deserve it.

What, I deserve this?

Why do I deserve this?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Because you got what I want.

Amy.

This is all about Amy?

I thought when she found out
that you cheated on her

she would leave you right away.

You told her.

You told her. You fucking...

Oh, she is going to be devastated
when she finds out.

You sick fuck.

But that's okay, I will be right there
next to her to console her.

You sick fuck.

You sick fuck!
And how long do you think it'll be

before I'm fucking her?
You sick fuck!

In your own goddamn bed.

Don't you touch her! I'll fucking
kill you! I will fucking kill you.

What kind of man are you, huh?
You do this to your fucking friends?

When it comes to pussy,

I have no friends.

[CHAIN SAW BUZZING]

CARTER:
You motherfuckers want a show?

I'll give you a fucking show.
Go ahead.

CARTER:
Yeah!

Let him go.

[CHAIN SAW REVVING]

[CROWD CHEERING]

MAN:
Yeah!

[SCANNER BEEPING]

[CROWD CHEERING]


You motherfuckers
want a show, huh?

I'll give you a fucking show!


The house always wins.

WOMAN [OVER SPEAKERS]:
The honeymoon isn't quite over yet,
Elite Hunting Club members.

Now, who wants to bid
on killing the groom?


[DOOR OPENS]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Get me the fuck out of here,
you motherfuckers!

You sick fucks!

Come on!
Come to me, you motherfucker.

Shut your mouth or I'll fuck you up!
Come to me.

My turn now!
You motherfucker!

Give me that!

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

Huh? Oh, I'm so fucking happy.

You die, tough guy. It's your turn.


Die, motherfucker!
Die, you piece of shit!

You motherfucker!

You fucking die.

Now I fuck your mother, okay?

Fuck!


MAN 1 [ON TV]:
No!

Die, motherfucker!

Take that, you fucking bitch!

Come on, motherfuckers!

MAN 2 [OVER PHONE]:
I repeat, we have two escaped
prisoners on the loose.

Okay.

Sir. Sir, we have two
on the loose.

Have security round them up.
Yes, sir.

Sound the alarm.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[ALARM BLARING]

Oh, my God.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Please, please, please.

Oh, God, please.

OPERATOR:
911 operator,
what is your emergency?

Yes, I need help.
They're killing people.

What is your location, sir?

Look, I don't know where I am.

That's okay, sir.
Oh, wait, wait.

Please wait.
Stay on the line. Stay calm.

They've killed my friends.
Killed your friends.

Hurry.
They're gonna kill me.

Remain calm, sir.
Stay on the line.

I see dead people.

We've got a point of location.

The police are on their way.

Fuck!

FLEMMING:
My friends, please, keep your seats.

We are experiencing
a temporary power interruption.

As a safety precaution,

you will be escorted
to your vehicles.


Yeah. Tennessee tuxedo
called the cops.

We've been compromised.

That's it, we're shutting down.

Kill the prisoners?

Kill them all.

No witnesses.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

KENDRA:
Help me, please. Please, help.

Please, don't! Please!


KENDRA:

Oh, God. Okay.
Get me out.

Hurry.
Fuck!

Come on, come on, come on.

Come on, come on.

[KENDRA SCREAMS]

Shit!

Why the hurry, huh?

The place is gonna blow.
Yeah?

[EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE]

AMY:
I can't believe he's gone.

I just-- I feel like none of this
would have happened

if I hadn't take him
to Vegas.

Don't talk like that.

Hell, at least, you survived.


It's okay.

You can cry.

Carter?

Yeah?

I don't wanna be alone tonight.

You don't have to be, Amy.

I'm right here.

I'm not going anywhere.

I need a drink.

Would you like a drink?
Yeah.

I would love a drink. Yeah.

Okay.

Oh, can I help you with that?
Oh, no.

I got it.


Problem is...

he's alive.


What do you say
we finish that bachelor party?
