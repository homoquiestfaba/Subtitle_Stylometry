TONY GILROY: Andor <i>is
a prequel to</i> Rogue One.

It rewinds back five years
to follow Cassian Andor.

We also knew we had
an origin story for him as a child.

<i>And so, we found it
a really compelling a story.</i>

CASSIAN: <i>To steal from the Empire?</i>

<i>You just walk in like you belong.</i>

<i>They can't imagine that someone like me</i>

<i>would ever get inside their house.</i>

LUNA: Andor <i>is about how</i>
<i>a revolutionary is born.</i>

And the beauty of this show

is that it commits to a perspective
and a point of view.

You can tell that there is
that integrity behind this character.

I've been in this fight
since I was six years old.

You have this guy in <i>Rogue</i>
who's a very complicated warrior,

<i>fighter, leader, pilot.</i>

And then that guy is gonna be so committed
and so passionate to the cause.

I wanna see how and what did it take
to get there,

and how far away could he be?

LUNA: <i>The idea of a migrant,</i>

someone that is forced to be far away
from where he belongs.

And it takes him many years in his life
to find that there is something for me

to defend, to fight for,
even if it's an idea.


(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

We're curating
a five-year period of history.

<i>In that five years,
the Empire is consolidating power</i>

<i>and they're taking over,
closing down these corporate planets</i>

<i>and pillaging other planets.</i>

And at the same time, the Rebellion
is just popping up everywhere.


MAARVA: <i>People are standing up.</i>

In this show, we deal with everything
through the characters,

on the ground, real behavior,
real needs, real anxieties,

real decisions,
real moments of challenge for people.

We wanna be as absolutely real
as we can in this massive,

dynamic, adventure story.

LUNA: <i>The characters matter.</i>

<i>You're not just there to be
in a fantastic scenery.</i>

The characters are there
because they have something to say.

They have a position,
an ambition, and a goal.

GILROY: <i>We really had to do some locations</i>

and finding places
that really had great bones.

Look at the scale of the bones
and what can we do with this?

<i>We want to take the best of what we get.</i>

<i>In</i> Star <i>Wars, you get</i>
<i>an incredible aesthetic</i>

<i>and you get an incredible tactile feel</i>

<i>of all the things
they've built over the years.</i>

And the tradition of the quality
of all that is fantastic.

And you're like, "Okay, let's take
all that and expand it out a lot more."

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

LUNA: <i>The music was there.</i>

I was performing
and I was hearing the music

that you will hear when you watch it.

<i>And it's very emotional.</i>

Nick Britell is composing
a lot of music for our show.

<i>The music is incredible.</i>

<i>It also just really
set the tone of the show.</i>


There's an expectation
for a certain amount of action

<i>and adventure in the show.</i>

You can't do a small version of this.

<i>The scale is really huge.</i>

It's all in, right there, from the top.

<i>So, it's pretty fantastic.</i>

It's beautiful,
and it's very well-written.

It's a perfect story of a revolution.

LUTHEN: Where'd you get it?

CASSIAN: What difference does that make?

I see three choices.

Either you're an Imperial spy,

you're fronting for the person
I really want to speak to,

or you're the thing itself.

I see one choice.

Either you got my money or you don't.


LUTHEN: So which is it?

I know Bix has her game.

I know you bribe quartermasters
to leave valuables on the ships

before they come in for scrap.
But this isn't that.

This isn't something they'd let pass.

No.

I went in and got this myself.

How? How's that possible?

It was... It was sealed
on the Imperial Naval Base in Steergard.

Look, you got the money. I got the box.

What else is there to talk about?

I'll give you another thousand credits
to tell me how you got it.


LUTHEN: Done.

How?


You just walk in like you belong.

Takes more than that, doesn't it?
CASSIAN: What? To steal from the Empire?

What do you need?

A uniform, some dirty hands
and an Imperial tool kit.

they don't even care.

They're so fat and satisfied,
they can't imagine it.

Can't imagine what?

CASSIAN: That someone like me
would ever get inside their house,

walk their floors,

spit in their food, take their gear.

The arrogance is remarkable, isn't it?

They don't even think about us.

Us? I don't know you.

LUTHEN: Fair enough. But I know you.

These days will end, Cassian Andor.

The way they laugh.
The way they push through a crowd.

The sound of that voice
telling you to stop, to go, to move.

Telling you to die.

Rings in the ear, doesn't it?

Why don't you let me count that money?

But they'll think about us soon enough.

We should get moving.

Soon enough,
they'll have something else to listen to.

You don't want to get caught with it.

Well, they'd hang me, wouldn't they?

Take me up Rix Road
and hang me in the square.

Wouldn't be the first time, would it?

Isn't that where they hung your father?

Who are you?
(BLASTER COCKING)

What is this?

LUTHEN: I said I know you.

I know all about you.

Yes, I want the box,

and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.

I came looking for something more,
and I think I've found it.

I'd like you to come with me.

How do you know about me?

I was hoping
for a more relaxed conversation,

but you're right, we don't have time.

Contrary to what you told me,
I doubt that you'll be stickin' around.

I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,

and I know they're coming for you.

Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.

Waste of talent.


That's the wrong question.

The right question is how much time
do we have to get out of here.

Why would I go anywhere with you?

Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?

LUTHEN: No!

SOLDIER: There he is!

(BLASTERS FIRING)


(BLASTERS FIRING)

LUTHEN: Get down!

CASSIAN: I'm going. Cover me!
LUTHEN: Forget the box!

(BLASTERS FIRING)


(METAL RATTLING)


SOLDIER: <i>We're taking heavy fire.</i>

I told you to wait!

SOLDIER: <i>We've got two men down.</i>

East Team, repeat last.

East Team, repeat last.

(BLASTERS FIRING)



Come on!

(METAL CREAKING)



(BLASTERS FIRING)

(CASSIAN GRUNTING)

(BLASTERS FIRING)


CASSIAN: Look out!

(CHAIN RATTLING)


(CHAINS RATTLING)


Now! Come!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC CRESCENDOS)

(<i>THE FORCE THEME </i>PLAYING)

CASSIAN: <i>We've all done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.</i>

<i>Spies...</i>

<i>Saboteurs...</i>

<i>Assassins...</i>

LUTHEN:<i> Cassian Andor.</i>

I'd like you to come with me.

<i>Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?</i>

VEL:<i> We've chosen a side.</i>

We're fighting against the dark.

MON:<i> People will suffer.</i>

You realize what you've set in motion?

Let's call it, war.

People are standing up.

CASSIAN:<i> Everything I did...</i>


<i>I did for the Rebellion.</i>
