[Ta a be, in English] I remember when
Father told me I was ready for <i>kÃ¼htaamia</i>.

My big hunt.

You were little.
So, Mother took you to gather medicine.

But Father and I,
we went up into the hills.

The rain was bad. Everything was wet.

We crawled through the mud
and my bowstringâ€¦

[snores]
â€¦got ruined and...


[squawks]
You were sleeping.

I was waiting for it to circle back.

Now you're gonna have to
cross the river to get it.


Don't get your bowstring wet.

Ta a be,

this morning in the sky,

I saw a sign. The thunder bird.

I've been practicing.

It's time. I'm ready for my <i>kÃ¼htaamia</i>.

You really think you're ready?

You wanna hunt something
that's hunting you?

[chattering in Comanche]

[Naru, in Comanche] <i>PetsÃ¼.</i>

[mother chuckles]

[in English] Trained him well.
It's easy. He's smart.

Not every smart creature is easy to train.

[Naru] Is that for War Chief's bad knee?
Mmm.


You didn't put orange <i>totsiyaa</i>.

Who taught you about orange <i>totsiyaa</i>?

You.

Hmm.

Your father left you that
to cut bread root with.

I almost got a deer with it.

Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost."

My girl, you are good
at so many other things.

Why do you want to hunt?

Because you all think that I can't.


Ah!

In this wind, he brings home a red-tail.

[Ta a be chuckles]

You should have listened to my story.

Didn't think we had time for a nap.

[scoffs]
[mother laughs]

[Ta a be, in Comanche] <i>Posa</i>.

[in English] It's sharp enough.

Go get us some orange <i>totsiyaa</i>.

[Predator clicking]


[Sarii snuffles]
[sighs]

[tribes people ululating]

[tribes people chattering, shouting]

[in Comanche] <i>Hina</i>?
[in English] A lion. It took Puhi.

We gotta find him.

[bushes rustle]

[stones tumble]

[Predator clicking]

[footsteps approaching, clicking]

[Sarii panting]

You could get shot sneaking up like that.

Who's sneaking?
[Ta a be chuckles]

Who invited you?

We won't be gone long enough
to need a cook.

[Paaka laughs]

She should stay.

She tracks well.

And if we find Puhi alive,
she knows medicine.

You have to find that cat now.

I will.
I know.

'Cause you have to.



[electronic hum]

[mouse squeaks]




[Predator growling]

Oh, good. The dog found shit.

We're not looking for wolves.
[Naru] It's not wolf.

You see that crushed bone?

That's lion scat.

And the cat that made it was big.


[Sarii whining]

He's breathing.

[Ta a be, in Comanche] <i>PetsÃ¼</i>.


[It see, in English]
So much could kill him.

Just cool his blood.


[in Comanche] <i>Anaa. Anaa</i>.

[Wasape, in English]
Ta a be wants to stay and hunt.

Let's go.

I'm coming with you.
I can handle the lion.

No, it's not just the lion.

Why is Puhi alive? There's something
that scared the cat away from its den.

I've got this.

Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too.

We don't have time to waste talking.
We need to get him home.

[in Comanche] <i>ManamÃœsohi</i>.

[animals calling]

[Puhi, in Comanche] <i>Ãœts'tÃ¼ nÃ¼</i>.

[in English] The cold is good.

The medicine slows his blood.
If he gets warm, he'll bleed out.

Hey.

Do you want him
to be comfortable or alive?

[in Comanche] <i>Mia</i>.

[Sarii whimpers, snuffles]





[Sarii barking]

[in English]
We don't have time to wait for you.

Look.
[Paaka] Could be bear tracks.

Maybe.

But that's a big bear.

And why was it on its hind legs?
And what skins a snake like that?

We need to keep moving.
No.

I have to warn my brother.

Paaka, go with her.

[bushes rustle]

Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

We're in its hunting grounds.

Why'd you come back?

I found tracks, and they were huge.


I don't think it was a bear.

I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

It skinned and gutted a snake.

Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

We have to deal with it first.

Come on.

that we're hunting it here.


We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

We'll try it Naru's way.

We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

Wait.

It's time, Naru.

Your <i>kÃ¼htaamia</i>.

When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

"This is as far as you go.

No more. This is it."

[insects buzzing]


It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

You think you're ready?

You've never faced a lion.

Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

and kill it. [screams]

Okay.

I have to find him.

No, you need to rest.

[Naru grunts]

[in Comanche] <i>Ihka</i>.

[in English] Drink this tea.

[in Comanche] <i>Ihka</i>.


[in English] Puhi survived
because of your medicine.

There's something else out there.
Ta a be needs my help.

If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

You think the reason for <i>kÃ¼htaamia</i>
is to prove you can hunt,

but there's only one reason.

To survive.

[tribe member chuckles] War Chief.

Naru.

Where are you going?

We did it.
[sighs]

No.

We didn't do it.

What do you think left those tracks
and skinned that snake?

And before I fell,

I saw lightning in the trees.
Naru.

There's something else out there.
And if there is, I'll get it.

We need to go back out.

Far, beyond the ridge line.
No.

Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to.
You can't.

Do I need your permission, War Chief?
[sighs] It's not about permission.

You can't. [stammers, sighs]

I had to carry you back.

I can hunt.

You're right.


I did.

You tried it. You justâ€¦ [sighs]

You couldn't bring it home.

Where is he?

Searching for you
on the other side of the pass.

Where are you going?

I saw it.
[Wasape] Saw what?

I saw what left those tracks.

The bear?
There was a bear,

but there was something else,
and it was huge.

I couldn't see it until it was
covered in blood, but it looked like...

Like a <i>mupitsl</i>.
[Wasape scoffs]

You saw a monster from a children's story?

It fought and killed a bear
with its hands, easily.

How come it didn't kill you?

Stop!

You're going home.

Before the trappers captured me,
it saw me.

It came right up to me

and then left.

It didn't think I was a threat.


You wanna know how I killed that lion?


You weakened it.

You had it, Naru.

You can see what I miss.

You always have.

I don't know that this thing

So it chewed off its own leg.
