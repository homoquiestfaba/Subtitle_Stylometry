We're finally going
to get to see.

<i>Super Ultra Death Woman 4.</i>

The Deathening.

She'll chew you up
and spit you out.

She's tough as nails and
harder than an old biscuit.

I had a nightmare

I was a biscuit once.

That's why I'm gluten free.

It's going to be so cool.

My daddy won't tell
me what death is,

so I'm excited to learn about it

not only from an expert,

but a woman.

I hate these kinds of movies,

but I fear if I keep
rejecting your invitations

you'll stop inviting
me to things.

You're right to think so.

Now, come on. Let's
go see a dang movie.

Hi. Three tickets for
<i>The Deathening, please.</i>

No, not so fast, kiddos.

You little buddies are a bit too
young for such a violent movie.

I know the perfect movie for
you guys to watch instead.

<i>Baby Dooky Dum Dum 6,</i>

This time they suck
on a big pinky.

<i>Baby Dooky Dum Dum 6?</i>

That movie is the worst.

I mean, one through
three were good,

but man, they lost
the plot after four.

Come on, guys, if they want a
grown-up, we'll give them a grown-up.

Now we'll get
treated like adults

or at least just one adult.

Augie?

You really think
this is gonna work?

'Course it will. We're hot now.

Whoa.

Oh, wow. That cloud
looks like a worm.

Uh, excuse me.

A man with the voice of a child.

Oh what? No, no, no, no.

Uhh, I'm an adult.

Oh, my bad, pal.

He's as slow as
molasses in January.

So, how can I help you?

One ticket for <i>The
Deathening, please.</i>

Huh. I can't help but
think you look familiar.

Where do I know you from?

Oh, um... perhaps
you've heard of us.

I mean, me, I am,
uh, Mr. Flabby.

Dabby.
Wabby.

Jabby? Yes, I'm Mr. Fabby
Dabby Wabby Jabby,

and I'm a prominent lawyer

and I own a manor...
with Ponies.

Hmm.

If he knows we're lying,

he's gonna call the cops.

Oh, I probably just saw you
in super-hot yoga with Debbie.

Here ya go.

Yes. Finally.

Did somebody here
say they're a lawyer?

I need one immediately
for a law emergency.

Oh, yeah. This guy's a lawyer.

Uh, what?

The cops actually came.

What are we going to do?
We can't lie to a cop.

Yes, that's me.

An adult who's a lawyer.

Thank goodness.

Come with me.

Order! Order in the court.

I swear, the body was
already dead when I found it.

Oh, I gotta...

Gimme one sec.

Guys, what do I do?

I've never been a lawyer before.

Just say something.

Anything.

'Cause if you don't, we'll never
get to see <i>Super Ultra Death Woman,</i>

and they will arrest us.

I can't get my one thousand good
night kisses from my daddy in jail.

Hmm. Something smells fishy.

And it's not Wally
Gator for once.

Oh, thank goodness.

Why are you taking so long?

Have you got something to hide?

This is a court of truth.

Uh, permission to
approach the bench?

Oh, sure. Talk to me, babe.

What's up? Let's
chiggidy-chat, yo.

Well, uh, you see
it was in my head

and I was having thoughts.

Thoughts, you know,
thoughts inside my head,

and while I was thinking,
it led me to a thought

which led me to think

uh... where's the potty?

Oh, that's easy.

It's down the hall...

Not guilty.

I'm not going to jail!

My gosh, we did it.

Hooray!

Get milked, ding dongs.

Ah, yes. Thank you. Thank you.

Mr. Flabby Grabby Jabby Jabby,

you cracked the toughest
case in Jellystone history

and you're polling in at a
100% smartest guy in town.

Will you run for mayor?

Uhhh...

Just say yes or we
will never get to see.

<i>The Deathening.</i>

Uhhh... Get with it.

Yes, we will.

I mean, me... will
run for mayor.

Mr. Crabby, Crabby, Crabby...

What's your stance on Corporate
Megamergers and Trans-Pacific Partnerships?

I like... ponies.

Can't argue with that.

What?

You know, we all should
just skip the election

to make him mayor right now.

I concede.

What?

How did it come to this?

I just wanted to
see a dang movie.

And now we have to
work in big government.

Just one more in,

and that's all my
tiny wooden cups.

This really is the end of
an era for old Huckleberry.

Now wait, just a minute here...

Ahhh!

Why'd you blow our cover?

Hey, it's hard work being legs.

My blood sugar's gettin' low.

We've gone too far, Augie.

You can't bonk the ex-mayor.

Relax, Yakky.

I just activated a chakra point
on his head to put him into a coma

using defensive jutsu
my daddy taught me.

Sick.

We're going to see
<i>The Deathening.</i>

Even if we have to die.

Augie, I should just tell
you now, death isn't...

No. Spoilers!

Mr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor?
Mr. Mayor...

Come on, guys.

Yeah, come... come.

Uh, come in.

Oh, it's so horrible, Mr. Mayor.

An alien mothership has landed
in Jellystone Town Square,

and they want to see
the town's leader,

or they'll destroy us all.

Set quadrants four, five and
seven in medium frequency

and increase the
amp by 5.7 notches.

Where the heck is the mayor?

Reporting for duty.

Uh, are the aliens real aliens?

I can't see past Granny's
withered ol' tush.

It's like a dream.

Let me fill you in, Mr. Mayor.

We've managed to establish
communication with the alien

on a primitive
level using sound.

Allow me to demonstrate.

They say to hurry up and
bring them our leaders

so they can pass judgment
on our civilization.

You're our only hope, Mr. Mayor.

Well, here goes nothing.

Yeah. Go get him, Mr. Mayor.

Oh. Uh...

Hello.

Oh, my gosh. He's so ugly.

Guys, guys. What do I do?

Well, in Nippon, people
bow as a form of respect.

Um, welcome to Jellystone,
handsome traveler.

Okay, we are bowing now.

This is hard when there's
like two extra butts in here.

I'm trying to hold.

What's he doing?

I can't hold it much longer.

Please, Please, Please,
please, please, please, please.

Bleep.

I'm slipping!

Yackky, no.

Bleep.

Bleep.

Okay, everything's fine now.

The alien went underground
to go to sleep.

Yay! Whoo-hoo!

Are you okay, Yakky?

My life flashed before my eyes.

It was short.

Oh, why does this guy smell
like Momma's hot bean steak?

Look, there's the hero
who saved us from aliens.

Hmm. He's as big as Europe.

Hey, over here, big guy.

I think we're in
the clear, guys.

You mean we can go see...

<i>The Deathening?</i>

Finally, it's time.

Let's do this.

Excuse me.

One ticket for <i>The
Deathening, please.</i>

Hey, you're that
guy from earlier,

or did you put on some
sick gains, brother?

Yes.
Well, here's your ticket.

From one big buff
boy to another.

Got it!

Nuts.

The... the...

The buddies from earlier.

Oh, we were so close.

At least I could
hold you just once.

You can arrest us now.

Just be gentle.

Oh, you wish I would arrest you.

Not only did I almost
let six people in

for the price of one ticket,

but I nearly let you pure,
innocent, tiny children

see a movie that
is way too violent

and much too mature for your
little, tiny, infant, baby ages.

And now you forced me
to have to give you

the big boot.

Now turn your tiny butts
around so I can kick them.

Now, what's all this then?

The real Mr. Flabby,
Wabby, Jabby?

Word got lost between here and
my cottage on the north side.

It's come to my understanding
that you lot have been doing

quite a good job
filling in for me.

Now, Mr. Concierge,

sir, I do believe, it
is within movie law

that young fellows may be
admitted to the theater

with an adult of
appropriate age.

In this case, it would
be yours truly. Wot? Wot?

Huh?

Well, what do you know?

It's right here
in the rule book.

Right next to, "Thou shalt
not text during movies."

Hooray!

Here are your tickets.

Our hardships are finally over.

Oh, this will be a
night to remember.

You've had this coming for
a long time, Demon man.

Prepare for The Deathening.

Care for some popcorn?

You could have told me
death was gonna be so juicy.

I want my mama and a big binkie.

It's like my dreams...

But I'm awake.
