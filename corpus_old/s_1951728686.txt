I do.

You should go talk to her.

You think so?

Webber!

I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

But Tatianna will miss you.

The King doesn't want his queen

Okay.

A young lady.

Is she cute?
Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

He never says "no."

(DOORBELL RINGING)

I am the king. Thank you very much.

Hmm.

Look out.

Hello.

Goodbye.

Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

You don't get abs like these

Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.


It's ridiculous, isn't it?

Bye-bye.

It's ridiculous.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

I don't want any money. I want...

I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

You're so cute.

(EX CLAIMING)

Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

Didrt your mom ever teach you that?
Yeah.

Well, where is she?
On an airplane.

On an airplane?
Well, who are you here with?

My father.

Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

He's not looking for me.
How do you know?

Because he's looking at me.

What?

Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

Sara Kelly?

My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.


No. No. Nope. No!

No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

She wrote you a note.
Wrote me a note.


"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

"I need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara."

You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

Anybody could have written this.
Oh, yeah.

(JOE SCOFFS)

I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

Birth certificate?

Your name is on it.
(CHUCKLING) My name is...

My name?

Awesome!

<i>ELEC TRONIC VOICE: Ready? Break!</i>

My name's not on this.

"Joseph Kingman."

<i>(SPEED-DIALIN G)</i>

<i>Hut! Hut! Hut!</i>

We've got a situation.
<i>Touchdown!</i>

Fix it.

Oh!

Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

I didn't know.
You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

Didrt even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

Okay, but for argument's sake,

is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

Think hard.


We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...


Is anyone else hungry?

Hungry?
Joe...

When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

About eight, nine years ago.

How old are you, kid?
Eight.

Congratulations, Joe.

This isn't happening to me.

(SPIKE WAILING)

Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

Hmm?

It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

She's on her way to Africa.

What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

So on her way to save the world,

your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet." And I said...

I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

Sara has a sister.

Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

Karen.
Karen. What about her?

She's...

She's dead.

Oh, that's convenient.

What?

How do we get in touch
with your mom?

Her cell won't work in Kassala.
Email?

They don't have Internet there.

How did you get here again?

We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

And the car just magically
dropped you off at some mars house?

Not some man. My father.
So you say.

Want a paternity test?
Yes. That's a great idea.

Let's do that. No problem.

I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

If she does turn out to be yours,

you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

Stella.
Hmm.

We don't even look alike.

Oh, no. Not at all.

Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
Hey, I told you she was cute.

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

I'm late.


Let's go. No huddle.

No back seat.
So what? Get in the car.

If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

Come here.

(HORNS HONKING)

So late.

I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

so let's get started, shall we?

I'm going to ask you some questions

and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

Now, for example,

if you asked me what my favorite thing
to do was, I would say ballet.

So what's your favorite thing to do?

That's easy. Play football.

Football.

(HONKS HORN)

Come on!

If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

My Heisman.

No, wait... I know.

My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

Just one more question.

What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

Listen, I got a question for you.

Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

Want a cookie?

No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

But you said you were hungry.

And I made them special for you.
Fine, fine.

Now, about your mom.
I told you, it was last-minute.

I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.


I know what happened.

You do?
Yeah.


She's gained a lot of weight.
No.

What's she pushing now? About 180?

Deuce?

(WHISTLE BLOWS)


What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

Are you okay?

Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
Cinnamon!

Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

Oh, I'm sorry.
All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

I'm allergic to nuts.

Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

You have to be there this time.
I'll be there.

What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

Stop touching me.

Stop eating so much.

You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
Start a tab.

Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.

Joe had a kid.

Joe is in an ice bath.

Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
Glove.

Yeah.

Webber, think about this.

Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

More like a safety blitz.

Yeah, well, you should be happy.

I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

JOE: Yeah, but you knew
they were coming.

Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

What's your name, sweetheart?

Peyton.
Peyton, that's cute.

Hi, Peyton.
Hi.

Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

No. Peyton Rous.

Who's that?
He won the Nobel Prize.

For what team?

In medicine.

He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

"Stupid" is a mean word.

No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

Isn't.
Is!

Isn't.
Is!

JOE: Quiet. Both of you.


Step away from my pants.

Awkward.

Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

or he thinks we won't win.
Oh.

Good night.

I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.


A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

I'll show you.

Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

Once upon a time there was a princess

and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

She had a pink dress, a red dress,

a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

an orange dress, a yellow dress...
I get it. I get it. I get it.

A lot of dresses, a lot of colors.
So what?

So each dress had a secret power.

The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

could make her fly.

And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

could make her tiny.

And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

could make her sleep.




Whoa!

Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

I mean, is it as good as they promised?

Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house."

The O's mean "open access."

But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

Off limits. No access.

Can't go there, because you made

how can you remember the plays

when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

<i>Thank you. Thank you guys</i>
<i>so much for coming out.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>thank you so much for coming.</i>

<i>Great questions, by the way.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>As you all know by now,</i>
<i>I've recently learned I'm a father.</i>

<i>And clearly,</i>
<i>I'm still getting the hang of things.</i>

MAN: That's not an excuse, Joe.

<i>But you better believe that Peytors</i>
<i>nightclub evenings are behind her.</i>

<i>Because from now on, we're both</i>
<i>going to be going to sleep early, right?</i>

<i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

<i>Now, who's number one on the field</i>
<i>and number one in your heart?</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

<i>Can I say something, please?</i>

No. Let's go.

<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,</i>

<i>the one who'll be going to bed early</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

(ALL LAUGHING)

(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>My dad didn't have much of</i>
<i>a heads-up on this whole father thing</i>

<i>and he is still</i>
<i>getting the hang of things.</i>

<i>But it's like everything else in his life.</i>

<i>He never says "no."</i>

<i>I mean, he's teaching me</i>
<i>that you can do anything</i>

<i>if you've got motivation</i>
<i>and determination.</i>

<i>And the place where that starts</i>

<i>is right here, in the heart.</i>

<i>You're the world's greatest father.</i>

(ALL EX CLAIMING)

That was good.

That was really good.
It's going to cost you.


MONIQUE:
...two, three, four, grand plié...

There you go, there you go.

And...

Come on, this isn't a sport.

Football. Football's a sport.

Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

Hello. This is Peyton.

Hi.
And she's here for this.

So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

and we don't accept students
without an audition

and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

Money's no object,
as you probably know.

Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

That's very nice.
Thank you.

Go change, go on, go change.

Let me see how she does today. Okay?

All right.

(GIRL SCREAMS)

(JOE CLEARS THROAT)

(GIRLS LAUGHING)

Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

The moms sit over there.

Excuse me. Thank you.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

And one, two, three, very long...

Come on, come on.

And one, two, three, four.

Open up, like a princess, chin up.

Thank you.

Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

Thank you.

Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

we'd love to have you.

I'll come every single day.
All day, every day.

Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

And when we make a commitment
to a student,

we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

Can you do that?

Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

And why is that?
You don't know who I am?

No.


I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

Number one on that field

and number one
in your pretty little heart.

"The King of the Gridiron."

"Never-Say-No Joe?"

No? Nothing?

Odd.

Well, don't you know who I am?
No.

I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

She must be living under a rock.

<i>MAN ON TV: Raef will take it this time.</i>
He shoots! Come on!

<i>Got it.</i>
Yeah!

(EX CLAIMING)

<i>I didn't see what happened</i>
<i>to Paul Pierce.</i>

<i>We'll be right back</i>

<i>after a word from our...</i>
Let's go, Paul!

I can't believe they came from 10 down.

Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

Let's get Webber.

Webber, you want a soda?

Huh?

Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

Oh...

(ALL LAUGHING)

That's refreshing.
Good one.

What's up, Joe?

I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

I asked you to be careful!

Which bathroom should I use?
The one off the trophy room.

(SPIKE BARKS)

COOPER: Come on, Pierce!

Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

WEBBER: The mars a beast.
You saw that, Joe. You saw that.

That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

Celtics got this one locked up.

Hold on, hold on...

<i>(MAN CHA TTERIN G ON TV)</i>

Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.


Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

What did I do?

JOE: Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
Three seconds left.

(ALL CLAMORING)

<i>GIRL ON TV: Welcome to</i>
<i>the Magical World of Ponies.</i>

What happened?

Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

Get the mechanicals!

The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

<i>(POP MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

What are you doing?
I'm trying! I'm trying!

It's right there. See?

<i>MAN ON TV: Unbelievable!</i>


We missed it!

<i>You gotta celebrate.</i>
Peyton.

What did I do?

Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

Wait. Where are you going?

You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

I got to get home to...
Where?

Nothing.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

Bath. Bed. Now.

Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

Not too much. That's good.

Perfect.


This could take a while.

<i>(S OFT MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

<i>MAN ON TV: But what really sets</i>
<i>this future Hall of Famer apart...</i>

Passion for the game.

(SPIKE BARKING)

Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

Spike!


Spike?

What happened?

Spike.

Peyton?

Peyton! Peyton!


Peyton!

(SPIKE BARKING)

I'm not going to yell.

We're going to have a very calm

(CLEARS THROAT)

and rational discussion

about all...

You Bedazzled my football.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

(SPIKE SNORING)

You guys comfortable? My pillow.


King on the couch!

This is ridiculous.

<i>(ROCK MUSIC PLA YIN G ON RADIO)</i>

Never

say...

<i>(SLOW MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

No! No!

I have to warm up.

<i>(ROCK MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

I have to practice.

<i>(SLOW MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

I have a playoff game this weekend.

Do you...
Do you know what that means?

<i>(ROCK MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

<i>(SLOW MUSIC PLA YIN G)</i>

My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

Is nothing sacred?


My towel! My towel.

This is all mine! It's all me!

It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

<i>MARV: Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,</i>
<i>along with Boomer Esiason.</i>

<i>We're here in the Mile High City</i>
<i>where Denver hosts Boston</i>

<i>in the first round of the playoffs.</i>

In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

<i>We have a rematch</i>
<i>of last year's Conference Final</i>

<i>in which Denver narrowly escaped</i>
<i>with a 34-30 victory.</i>

<i>MARV: He has the tight end screen,</i>
<i>he side-arms it.</i>

<i>The catch made by Cooper.</i>

<i>Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.</i>

<i>And now, directing traffic...</i>

<i>Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!</i>

<i>And he's bounced out of bounds!</i>

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

Yeah! I did it again!

Oh, our boy looks great today.

He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

at the new Blake resort.

Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

Fanny.

Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

My mom says...

(EX CLAIMS)

I mean, my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock.

Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

<i>MARV: Kingman out of the gun,</i>
<i>takes a look.</i>

<i>He has Sanders wide open.</i>
<i>He's not going that way.</i>

<i>BOO MER: Marv, I've never</i>
<i>seen a quarterback</i>

<i>who doesn't trust his wide receivers</i>

<i>with a game on the line like this.</i>

<i>Touchdown! It's all over!</i>

<i>Boston has defeated Denver.</i>

<i>All on the legs of Joe Kingman,</i>


Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

for the second year in a row.

Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

JOE: Hey, King.


No, I'm the king. You're the king.

Don't jump.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Mr. Kingman?

Oh, no. Peyton.

Hey.

Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about...
You know what?

Why don't you just call me Joe?


Stop it. Stop it.

Mr. Kingman,
I informed you from the start

that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare center.

Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.


I just knew
you were one of those parents.

One of what parents?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

All I know is I have an entire team...

Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

Listen, I care about Peyton.
Then prove it!

I got it.
Hey, sweetie!

Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

Cool.

No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.


You're a freakishly large man

and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

Not a ballerina.

You do me a favor, <i>mamita?</i>
Can you please hold this for me?

Thank you so much.

Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

I'm the only one that talks.


(EX CLAIMS)

Up!


(EX CLAIMS)

...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.


Wasrt so bad.

We're just warming up, so come on.



Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

(CLEARS THROAT)

Hmm?

It wasrt... It wasrt so bad.

You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

And they hold and hold.

And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

Yeah. Right.

Yeah, right.

Listen, Mr. Kingman,

your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

She has passion, talent, discipline.


I guess she inerited more
than just your charm.

You see?

Let's try that one again.

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

(ALL GROAN)

Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

I was doing some stuff.

Well, you could've called.
You never call anymore.

Dude, stop being such a chick.

Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

You don't know the half of it.


(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello?
<i>KAREN: Hi!</i>

Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

I don't know where to start.

How about those pictures
you promised me?

E-mail me right now.

I have to see you.

Okay, hold on.

(TAPPING KE YS)

I just sent them.

You're breaking up. I love you.

Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

I love you, too.

(GROANS IN FRUSTRATION)

We need to talk. Follow me.


I need my bed back.

Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

(EX CLAIMING)

It's beautiful.

Thanks, Joe.
You're welcome.

Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

No more buttonooks in the kitchen.

Right. No more buttonooks.

You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

better than anybody.

But you and I,
you've been playing kid your entire life.

I just joined the dad team,
and I'm still learning all these plays.

No kidding.

All right.

Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

and call an audible, okay? And...

Here, this.

(CLEARS THROAT)

When the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz


and all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

(EX CLAIMING)

He scores.


All right, it's kind of like, just like in life.

Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

Then you got to call an audible.

You got to learn on the go.

Just like us. Okay?
Okay.

<i>Number one on the field,</i>
<i>and number one in your heart.</i>

<i>Now, number one on your toothbrush.</i>
That's funny.

My teeth are really white.

Ding!

That's ridiculous.

No, that's not. That's awesome.

<i>(CHA TTERIN G ON TV)</i>

Joe?
Yeah?

What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

Well, I...

(MACHINE BEEPS)

<i>VOICE ON MACHINE:</i>
<i>You have one incoming message.</i>

Hold that question, all right?

<i>JOE ON MACHINE:</i>
<i>This is the King. Do your thing.</i>

<i>Hey, baby, it's Tatianna.</i>
<i>I'm in Boston. I be there 6:00.</i>

<i>(BLOWS KISS)</i>


Tatianna's coming at 6:00.
I got plenty of time! It's 5:45!

Who's Tatianna?


I got 15 minutes.

Who's Tatianna?
5:45. 5:45. 5:45.

Listen, she's a friend.
I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.

Take all this, take it down, and...
Hide it in your room.

And you go, too.

And you play hide-and-seek with that,
and just make sure they're all gone.




PE YTON: Is Tatianna your girlfriend?


Do you mind?

No, no, no, no, maybe, yes.

Hi, you must be Melanie.
Joe has told me so much about you!

I'm Tatianna. What are you?
Peyton. Joe's daughter.

Joe's daughter?

Mmm-hmm.

How old are you anyway, four?
How old are you, 40?

I'm 21.
Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?

Joe!


<i>Bonsoir,</i> Tatianna.
Baby, welcome back!

You look <i>très...</i> Gorgeous!

I know.
I see you've already met...


Peyton.

Peyton, yes.
I don't know what she's told you.

'Cause she has
such a wild imagination.

Either way,
we have a lot to discuss over dinner.

Where are we eating?

You are going to eat
over at the Jensens', across the hall.
