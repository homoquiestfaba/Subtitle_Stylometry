[ alarm clock beeping ]

[ coughs ]

[ grunts ]

[ kisses ]

You want me
to make you breakfast?
[ kisses ]

With what?
There's nothing
in the fridge.

I'll go to the store
when you get paid.

We can crash dinner
at my mom's tonight.

[ gasps ]
I'd rather starve.

[ sighs ]

If I had a million dollars,
I'd stay in bed with you
all day.

[ moans ]

I'm gonna be late
for work, wife.

You know I'm quick,
husband.

[ moans ]

Hey, pete.

[ kickstand scrapes ]
whoops.

Oh, oh, oh.

[ dog yapping ]

â™ª [ whistling ]

Hey, fellas.
Good morning.

[ bell tolling ]

Good morning.
I have a great new offer
for you today.

Uh-huh.

Good morning.
Hi, donna.
Hi, john.

Okay, let's do this.
Let's sell some...
Television warranties.

[ wife ]
no, um,

[ whispering ]
I have not had experience
supervising others.

But I am a confident leader,

And I respond very well
to stress and deadlines.

No, um, I have not
had, uh, experience
supervising others.

But I am a confident leader,

And I respond well--
very well--
to stress and deadlines.

Hi, good morning,
mr. Sandveg.
Hope I didn't wake you.

<i>[ man ] hi, auntie.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

Uh, no, my name
is john macy.

Um, sir,
would you be interested
by any chance,

<i>[ man ] what happened is,</i>
<i>we've suddenly started</i>
<i>to hit real well.</i>

What's that?
<i>But our pitching</i>
<i>is just terrible.</i>

 <i>[ clicks, dial tone ]</i>
<i>- hello? Hello? Mr. Sandveg?</i>

Hey, what went wrong
on that sale there, john?

Um, this sale.
Dementia.

Okay. Think about
what we talked about.

Productivity,
performance, punctuality,

The three main pivot points
to you recapturing
your optimal performance level.

Why is this a problem?

Oh, I just think it's honestly
a pretty bad economy right now.

Don't tell me economy.
Everyone's blaming the economy.

You gonna blame somebody?
Blame--

The damn republicans?

What? Don't sass me.
And don't sass my party.

I--
make some calls.
Focus up.

Get rid of those
dumb-ass toys.

[ clicks pen ]

[ engine off ]

[ man ]
â™ª first I'm here

â™ª then I'm there

â™ª and I know it's a drag

â™ª and I know it's a drag
<i>but I'm here â™ª</i>

I've spent the last
three years finishing
my undergraduate degree.

It's been tight,
but worth it...

So I could sit here today,
fully qualified
for my dream job.

[ sighs ]
I'm ahead of the pack
for once.

[ man ]
we have a lot of applicants,

All of whom have
master's degrees...

Or ten years' experience.

Okay.

â™ª [ pop ]

â™ª flower power, minishirts

â™ª in the big city
[ knocking ]

What do you want?
Came by for the rent check.

It's not due
for another three days,
arnie.

Well, then
I saved you a stamp.

Ow.

[ sighs ]

[ whistles ]

[ grunts ]

[ grunts ]

Here. You can't
cash that until Friday.

Weren't you, uh,
voted most likely to succeed
in high school, alice?

Yeah. Why?

Just wondering
what happened.
[ john ] oh.

Oopsies.
Oh, yeah, that guy.

Mmm.
You know,
he's getting promoted.

And I'm considering
several job offers
right now.

Oh, that's good.
That's nice.
Yeah.

Arnie.
Yard's a little shaggy.

Oh.
Bang!

Ah! Ah! Ah!

[ grunts ]

Hello, darling wife.
Hello, husband.

So, this is the part
where you tell me you got
a promotion at work...

And a huge bonus.

[ horn honks ]

You tell me to go get sexy
because you're taking me out.

I, uh, found
a hoagie time coupon
in the men's room.

[ laughs ]
it's a bogo.

Ooh.

Love when you spoil me.

Get inside.

It's hoagie time.

<i>[ gunfire ]</i>

Yes! You die.
 <i>[ gunfire continues ]</i>

I think I should just
become a navy seal
or something.

'cause I'm a tactical genius.

Why is it that real blood
makes you pass out,
but this is entertainment?

Because I'm killing
drug dealers and pimps.
It's god's work.

Hey, which credit card has
no interest until next year?

Um, citibank in July.

[ gunfire ]
[ typing ]

Oh! I died, baby.

So, when arnie
cashes our check,

We will be left with--
[ taps key ]

[ beeps ]

[ john ] why do you care so much
about what payton and ricky
think?

[ alice ] because
they're our friends, john, and
we went to high school together.

[ john ]
these people tortured me
in high school.

Hi, um,
alice and john macy.
I see you're on the list. Yeah.

Yeah, come on in.
Thank you.

[ alice ]
oh, my god.

Honey, was there anything
about a dress code
in the invitation?

I wanna die right now.
Yeah.

Seven years ago,
she was copying my trig
and banging all the jocks.

Her father gave her a bullshit
six-figure desk job...

While holding a solid
"c" average in communications
after seven years of college.

Her degree is as authentic
as her bouncy new tits.

Shall we go see some of
our good friends now?
[ exhales ]

Two whiskeys, neat.
Sure.

Hey, ricky,
what do you say?

Hey... Guy.

High five.
[ clears throat ]

It's getting hot outside,
right?

Real hot around here.
Here you go.

Walked outside yesterday
my whole--

My whole dick was out
just swingin' around.

Louise!

Hi.
I'm so glad
that you're here.

Yes.
Hey.
How are you?

Good. How are you?
You'll have to
excuse me.

I'm gonna go to the bar
and drink enough
to kill a horse.

[ chuckles ]
you want anything?
Yes, two beers please.

Got it.
Immediately.

Hi. So, I guess I didn't
get the memo to wear
something short and shiny.

Hey!
What's up, man?

I'm so happy you're here.
I'm so glad you're here.

Thought I was gonna have to
spend the whole night
hiding in the bathroom.

Yeah. Yeah,
I tried that one out.
At the vegan barbecue.

Oh, that was you?
That was me.

Dude, I spent 45 minutes
shittin' kale into a hat
in the backyard.

My mom got sick again.
So, it's like--
it's okay.

It's just that
we had to pay for
all the hospital bills,

And I didn't get
the scholarship.

So it's like--
it's a lot.

I'm really depressed now.
Tell me about it.

But good people
win out in the end.

Let's go do shots.
Yes, please.

It's a nice theme
they've got going on.
Yeah. Nice theme. Pink.

Looks like
a fuckin' asshole in here.
[ laughs ]

â™ª breakin' rocks

â™ª I fought the law

[ no audible dialogue ]

[ retching ]

Why did we drink so much?
[ groans ]

Because it was free.

We need to go shopping
if we want to eat today.

[ retching ]

How did your,
um, interview
go the other day?

If anything,
I was over-qualified.

Well, maybe you should just,
you know...

Set your sights
a little lower.

I have a $40,000 degree
in art history.

I really don't want to
work at the mall.

Baby, I'm not worried.
You're gonna have
an amazing job one day.

I know.
Things will get better.
Mmm.

[ chuckles ]

[ tires screech ]
[ horn honks ]

Oh!
Son of a bitch.
Are you okay?

Yeah.
You're sure?

Yeah, I think so.
Look at me.
You're okay.

[ mooing ]
yeah, looks like someone
sawed this thing clear off.

Honestly,
we could've been killed
very easily.

[ man ]
that was intentional.
Yeah.

That's been happening a lot
in this neighborhood lately.

People comin' around
sawin' off stop signs.

[ man ] I can't pay for that.
[ john ] we can't be held
accountable for any of this.

[ officer ]
neither of you are gonna be
paying anything today.

[ man ]
I been here 30 years--
I feel like shopping.

[ chattering ]
[ horn honks ]

Alice! Hey!
Jesus christ.

Slow down!
You're speedin' here!

[ chimes tinkle ]

Hello.
Can I help you?

No, thank you.
I'm just browsing
right now.

[ john ]
hey, alice?
I'm back here.

I, uh,
I don't think the axle's bent
or anything so--

You wanna get out of here
and get some food?

Well, the <i>antiques roadshow</i>
<i>is coming this weekend.</i>

Why don't we look around?
See if we can find something,
get on tv.

You wanna look
around here?
Yeah.

Um, excuse me.

Hi. Do you have
any, like, old-fashioned
records or comic books or--

Nothing for you.

Nooses?
Shotguns?
Poison?

Okay.
I'm gonna go just...
In the car.

This is me, before the war.

You were beautiful.

[ phone rings ]

[ chuckles ]
that's the telephone.

[ ringing continues ]

[ metallic humming ]

[ chimes jingle ]

Shit.

I got the car to work, baby.
Okay, great. Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go, now.

Why'd you run out of there
like baby face nelson?
What happened?

Stealing?
Are you kidding me?

We're, like,
two steps above white trash
as it already is.

This is so pretty.
Look at it.

[ tires screech ]

[ brakes squeal ]

[ rattles, stops ]

[ metallic humming ]
[ voice whispering ]

[ grunts ]
[ gasps ]

Ow!
Alice!
[ item jingles ]

What are you doing?

I was fighting in my dream.

Okay.
No more kung fu movies
before bed.

[ sighs ]

I love cats.
They get me much more
than people do.

Which reminds me.
Did you know mr. Tutor
is having an affair?

Mr. Tutor?
Yeah. He's into some
very kinky, kinky stuff.

Do you wanna see?
Come on.

Seriously.
[ gasps ]

Oh, my god.
Where-- oh, my--

Hi, mrs. Tutor. Hi.
Hi.

Nice to see you.
You havin' lunch
with the boss today?

Every Friday.

You know,
it's little things like that
that keep a marriage special.

[ chuckles ]
have a good day.
You too.

I'm calling about
the, uh, position
that you had listed.

No, I don't have
my master's,

But I have my bachelor's degree.

And I actually graduated
in the top third of my class.

Okay. Um, is there
any other position?

Something entry-level,
maybe?

[ sizzles ]
ow!

[ jingles ]
[ clatters ]

[ thunder rumbles ]

[ inhales ]

[ sizzles ]
ow!

Holy mother of god.

Seven hundred dollars.

[ sighs ]

Oh, shit!

Ow. Ow.

[ grunts ]

John, I've come
to the realization that...

You may not be
a great salesman.
Okay.

You don't smile
when you speak to clients
on the phone.

Right. And-and you think
my clients notice
when I don't smile...

Over the phone?

It's for my wife.
She has great taste.

What?

Good for her.
Okay. Listen up.

We're letting people
go, john.

And, uh,
you're the first.

Hold on.
Me? The first?
[ scoffs ]

I've been here longer than
half the people out there.

I'm one of two people
with a degree.

And donna's is from
an animal husbandry school.

We're not basing this
on seniority,
number one.

Number two,
don't belittle donna...

For her passion
for animal insemination,

What it's done for
this community and what
she's done for this company.

We're letting you go.
Do you have anything
else to add?

[ stammering ]

[ sucks lip ]
no.

[ sighs ]

[ sighs ]

Alice!

Jesus.
What the--

Alice!

Alice.

Hey, baby.
Baby, can you hear me?

Alice.
Johnny boy.

What happened to you?

There's someone in the house.
What? What do we do?

[ chuckles ]

[ chuckles ]
you're my hero.

You're kidding?

Baby, just tell me
what the hell happened?

I fell down the stairs.
We don't have stairs.

Ow.
There we go.

I think--
baby, I think we need to
take you to the hospital.

I'm fine.

Not everybody has to
go to the emergency room
for a mosquito bite.

It was one time.

Thing looked like
a hummingbird.

[ exhales ]

Are you drowsy
or nauseous?

I feel very awake.
More than I have in years.

I think you're concussed.
Look.

Watch me.

See?
I'm fine.

[ sighs ]

Why aren't you at work,
baby?

They fired me.

How can they do that?
I'll find another job.

How hard can that be?
Seriously?

[ sighs ]
it doesn't matter.

[ groans ]

What?

[ metallic ringing ]
[ gasps ]

You feel funny?

Like I might be
having a panic attack.

I'm so sorry
for this, john.

[ groans ]
what the--

What the hell?
Look! Look.

Look. It's better
than any paycheck.

You're giving me money
so you can hit me?

No, I'm not.
The teapot is.

It gives money
when you hurt yourself.

What?
How else can you explain it?

Alice. Alice!

You put the money
in the teapot
before you hit me.

No. No, I didn't.

It's empty.

Empty.

What are you doing?
[ grunts ]

Abracadabra.

[ gasps ]
ow.
I guess that really does hurt.

Where did that come from?
Seriously, john?

Okay.

[ blow lands ]
[ john ]
ow! Ow.

Jesus, alice.
What the--

Ouch.

Ouch.

Stop doing that.

This is the first time
I've been the breadwinner.
It feels good.

It's not a paycheck!
Alice, this is not a job.
Good.

Most people kill themselves
for decades and get nowhere.

It's a gift from the gods,
john.

It could end badly.
Very badly.

We can dig ourselves
out of this hole.

Get out of this place.
Get our own house.

Make a million bucks
and never work again.

[ sighs ]

It came to us for a reason.

[ owl hoots ]

John?

John?

No.
No, john!
No!

[ cow moos ]

Are you a gift from the gods?

[ sighs ]

<i>[ voices whispering ]</i>

Whoo.

So, john,
how did you come upon
this teapot?

I just found it
at a garage sale.

Just sitting there
next to a blender
and an old treadmill.

That's very fortunate.

'cause I must tell you,
when I saw this vessel
come in,

My heart skipped a beat.

I don't say this often,
on the show,

But I have never seen anything
quite like this before.

[ continues on tv ]
tremendous quality. The alchemy
of the metal is spectacular.

<i>Mostly brass,</i>
<i>but some other metal,</i>
<i>possibly silver.</i>

And notice here
the detail and the artistry
in this 24 karat gold filigree.

<i>It's impeccable. Truly,</i>
<i>truly an amazing find</i>
<i>you have here.</i>

Wow. Where do you think
it came from?

<i>[ host ]</i>
<i>I would guess</i>
<i>the middle east...</i>

<i>Or quite possibly</i>
<i>ancient china.</i>

<i>I've seen similar vessels</i>
<i>like this...</i>

<i>With the same structure</i>
<i>of sorts from some of</i>
<i>the earlier dynasties.</i>

<i>But nothing this unique</i>
<i>or well-preserved.</i>

This is truly
as if it hasn't aged
for several, several centuries.

<i>Do you know anything</i>
<i>at all else</i>
<i>about this teapot?</i>

[ john ]
um, no, I don't, really.

Except for the fact that...

It's traveled across the world,
through the hands of
many important people...

All of whom are now dead.

Okay.

I'm going to estimate
the value of your teapot
at $5,000.

Well done.
Well done.
Thank you.

We have to promise to stop
before it gets out of control.

We make our million
and we stop.

Ready?

Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Aah!
Ow, ow.

Hello.
How are you today?
Good.

Can I take your bag for you?
No, no, I'd rather
keep it here if that's okay.

I'll take the full brazilian.
I want it all gone, okay?

[ sighs ]
okay.

[ hair rips ]
[ screams ]

You know what?
Let's do this
the old fashioned way.

Sure.
Great.

[ drill whirs ]

[ screams ]

[ tattoo needle buzzes ]
oh, my god.

[ gags ]
ow! Ow! Ow!

Yeah,
that's gonna be great.

Are you sure
you don't want to just
take it to the bank?

How would we explain that
to the irs?

How much is it?
$194,173.

[ chuckles ]
yes.

Wow.

Hey. You want to go
for an even 200?

Tonight?
How?

[ muffled ]
spank me.

You want me to spank you?
Spank me, john.

Huh.
Okay.

[ door closes ]

You want me
to spank you with that?
Yeah, I do.

I don't want to
hurt you.

[ growls ]

You ready?
Do it.

[ light slap ]
how was that?
Harder?

Yeah.
This is crazy.

Harder!

Harder!

This is crazy.
I'm sorry.

You're pathetic.
I'm sorry. I can't.

[ groans ]

Hey, wow. Okay.

Oh! Ow.
[ jingles ]

Jesus christ.
Ow. Just hit, like
the cushy part.

Don't get my-- ow!
â™ª yeah, yeah

Okay, that's enough.
That's enough.

Oh, it's enough?

â™ª I've been so fast this day
hmm.
[ chuckles ]

â™ª hands all over your face

Ow.

â™ª I'll never leave behind

Where'd you learn all this?

I had moves
before I met you, john.

I met you in high school.
Yeah?

You were a stripper
in eighth grade?

[ exhales, chuckles ]
ow.

â™ª read your mind
<i>to save your life â™ª</i>

â™ª bye
[ thud ]

â™ª happened so fast

â™ª hands all over your face

[ sighs ]
you ready for me?

[ vibrating ]

Oh, my god.

[ john ]
ow.

Whoa.
[ groans ]

[ groans ]
wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

[ groans ]

Baby, when we go inside--
[ inhales ]

Will you be nice
to my mom?

Because she's always
so nice to me.

Be nice, okay?
[ john ]
hey, trudy.

You look great.
Oh, god.

[ alice ]
hi, mom. How are you?

We are just so excited
that you both could join us...

For our mostly vegan feast.

Mostly.
[ alice ]
thank you so much, sis.

Yummy.
So, john, are you still
with the same company?

Actually, no. I'm not.
We switched to
private investing.

Looks like
you're doin' all right.

And you, joe?
Still non-profits.

Right now I'm working
on a huge campaign for
the stock island tree snails.

Tree snails.
Yup.

Delicious with butter.
[ chuckles ]

We have a lot of snails
and flower fairies
in our garden.

Yes, we do.

Oh, yeah?
Do you like magic?

Yeah.
John.

[ plates rattle ]
if no one
is going to ask--

How have you gotten so far
on the paycheck of a pesky
goddamn telemarketer?

We actually made it big
on an investment, mom.

What investment?
Oatmeal futures.
Sexy shit.

If he's pimping you out,
I want you to come home
with me right now.

[ giggles ]

Yeah, why aren't you
out on the street
turning tricks?

You little... Slut.

I tell you what.
Let's just have
a pleasant dinner...

Minus the language
please.

I'm a white pimp in the suburbs.
That's how we talk. Legit.

I want answers!
Actually,

We're selling alice's eggs
to sterile mothers.

It's beneficial
for everybody.
Cage free, farm fresh.

But are they organic?
[ chuckles ]

Eggs.

So, alice,

Have you and john
put any thought into
having a b-a-b-y?

Mmm.
[ chuckles ]

Why is that funny?

Because that's what
you're <i>supposed</i> to do next,
right?

Have a baby?
Well, of course.

Why would I want an organism
growing exponentially
inside of my body...

And then ripping its way out
of my tight, sweet, fresh,

Young,
undamaged v-a-g-I-n-a?

Alice, you are the only one
in our family
who hasn't reproduced.

Having a child--

It's like the essence
of your soul is reflected
back at you.

It is like god
holding up a mirror
to your soul...

Saying "shazam"
and enjoy.

[ glass breaks ]

Maybe I should've
just gotten knocked up
in senior year like you.

[ chuckles ]
well, summer after
senior year.

Mmm.
Oh, yeah. That's right.

I'd forgotten.

Have you tried
the 12-bean salad?
Mmm.

Time to meet the sidewalk!
[ john ] come on.

Come on!
<i>[ gunfire ]</i>

Baby,
we are officially out of debt.

Well, isn't that good news?
Wow, so that means we'll be
at a million before christmas.

What's the rush?
Oh.

Don't we want a few of
life's necessities?
Mmm.

Some of the things
we've gone without?
Mm-hmm. Such as?

I want lots of new clothes.

Vodka.
I want my own vodka label.

[ chuckles ]
premium shit.

[ laughs ]
okay.

[ knocking ]

<i>[ voices whispering ]</i>
<i>who the hell is that?</i>

[ rapid knocking ]

Coming!

Coming!

<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

I'm sorry, guys.
We're not religious.

[ screams ]
oh, my god! Baby!
Baby, no!

Oh, baby, no.
[ groaning ]

[ groans ]
oh, baby!
[ screams ]

Hey!

Where is the teapot?
Teapot?

[ belt whips ]
ow!

Ow!
The one you had
on the television.

It's a precious
family heirloom.

Our grandmother risked her life
to save that teapot
during the holocaust.

-I bought it from the old lady.
She gave me a really good deal.
-Impossible.

[ john groaning ]

It was the last thing
she talked about
before she passed.

She said
her teapot was missing.

She died?

Aah!

Where is it?

We sold it!
We sold the teapot.

So where's the cash?
We want the money!

[ john groans ]
stop it!

Please stop.
It's just five grand,
and you can keep the change.

Where did all this
come from?
From my bra.

It's the rainy day fund.
Is there more?

No, no. Look.

Oh.

One bad deed for another, huh?

Oh, baby.
Are you okay?
I'm so, so, so sorry.

Is anything broken?
Ow.
[ sighs ]

We have to find out
what the hell this thing is.
Okay.

[ bell tolls ]

Ce30, period,
415g, period.

Wait. Wait.

A practical history of
magical objects and potions.

[ john ] it's the biggest book
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

<i>The legend</i>
<i>of the brass teapot.</i>

Wow.

The legend of the brass teapot
first appeared in folklore...

Around the time
of christ's crucifixion.

[ snaps ]
that's what the scholar
at the <i>roadshow</i> said,

That it was probably
from first or second century.

It also says...

That the teapot possesses
extraordinary
and inexplicable powers.

Well, that's one way
of putting it.
Right?

[ muttering ]
it's like it just goes on
forever and ever and ever.

Oh, my god.

Oh, here, here.
I have one.

Oh, whoopsie.

[ coughs ]

Shh.
Shh!

[ whispers ]
there's no one else here.

This book just goes
on and on and on.

All these different temples
and religions.
Let me see.

"bhardwaj warned that those
associated with ownership
of the teapot...

Were in for
unsavory consequences,

Including--"

No! Somebody
ripped out the page.

What?
Why would somebody
rip out the page?

No! What do you think
"unsavory consequences" mean?

I don't know.
But it's a really old book,
you know?

And we're probably not gonna
learn that much more from it
right now.

I think we should go
have fun. I think we should
go spend our money.

Can you look at my face
for a second?

Two hasidic jewish men
came and beat the shit
out of me in my own house...

When I was wearing
a silk, pink robe.

Don't gimme that face right now.

You ever have sex
in a library?

What?

<i>time bomb tickin' â™ª</i>

â™ª got a time bomb tickin', go

[ alice laughing ]

â™ª we're going sideways
<i>highways â™ª</i>

â™ª riding on an elevator
<i>cold just like an alligator â™ª</i>

â™ª now my baby's out of date

â™ª fighting and lightning
<i>and tightening â™ª</i>

â™ª above the buckles

â™ª [ vocalizing ]

â™ª [ vocalizing continues ]

Canape?
Oh, no, thank you.

Guys? Canape?
No, I'm allergic.

Hi, neighbor!
Hi.

You look gorgeous.

When you said the place
next to ours,

I thought you meant
up the street,
not this place!

[ chuckles ]
how did this happen?

Uh-- um--

Alice, hey. Hey.

Hi. Hi.
You look amazing.
Hey.

Thank you.
You must have gotten
your dream job.

Dreams are for people
who are sleeping,
not doers.

You could still dream,
I guess.

[ scoffs ]

â™ª [ rock ]

You like the sound of that?
Yeah.

Sounds nice, doesn't it?
Sounds like
they're really here.

This is my, uh,
favorite part
of the house.

Exclusive invite only.
[ chuckles ]

Try this on for size, huh?
Really?

To hard work.

[ gags ]

Ew.
Ooh.
It's a work in progress.

Well, I have to go
and show payton something
upstairs.

Okay.
Come on. Let's go.

Okay.
Yeah. See you around.

[ doorbell rings ]
hello.

Hi, I'm sorry.
Were we being too loud?

Dr. Li ling.

What is
the theosophist society?

We have interest
in antiquities.
Specifically teapots.

I have come from china,
john. May I enter?

We can talk right here.

Are you alone?

Yes.

I'm sorry. Can you just
give us one moment just to
talk amongst ourselves?

Thank you.

We should probably
listen to what he has to say.

Interest in teapots?
Seriously?

If he takes it,
the party will end.

Hi. Dr. Ling,
I wish you would have
called us sooner.

We donated the teapot
to a museum.

Tax write-off.

We must talk.
We don't have it.

You are in grave danger.
You must listen to me
before it is too late.

Leave us alone and
get off of our property!

[ chuckles ]

You buy girl scout
cookies once--

The best.
They were the best.

We were so close and then--
we used to come here
with marcy and dan.

But they don't splurge
since his dad went
to prison for embezzlement.

[ all chuckle ]

[ gargling ]
well, we believe in splurging
every once in a while.

Don't we, baby?
[ burps ]

We're trapped
in "splurgatory."

So what sort of dog
do you two have?

I heard him howling
last night.
Sounds like a big fella.

Oh, we don't have a dog.

That was just some
really violent sex.

We used to have
an australian shepherd.
Casper.

Beautiful, beautiful dog.
Ran off last year.

I left the door open.
I'm not blaming you.

Okay.

Oh, let us get the bill.
Yes, we insist.

No, no, no.
You guys paid last time.

You sure, alice?
That wasn't boone's
we were drinking.

[ john ]
holy shit.

No wonder why
it's so dark in this place.

One of us needs to
go to the bathroom,
baby.

We certainly do.
[ chuckles ]

I went last time.
I went yesterday.

Hmm. Fine.

But you're going
to the bathroom
the next two times, okay?

Okay. Excuse me.

John--
yes, dear?

Don't forget this.
Oh.

Thank you.
[ chuckles ]

Why does he need your bag?

Hemorrhoid cream.

Oh.
Alice, that's t.M.I.
Yes.

[ screaming, grunting ]
oh, no!

[ items crashing ]
[ chuckles ]

When do the vodka profits
start rolling in?

[ scoffs ]

What?
Mmm.

I might've
misread the market...

Pretty badly
actually.
[ chuckles ]

It's okay.
As long as we've got the teapot,
everything's gonna be okay.

Why do I get the feeling that,
when the time comes,

I'm going to have to
cut off one of your stubby
little fingers...

To throw this thing
into mount doom?

What?

It's a literary reference.

<i>Lord of the rings</i>
<i>is not literature.</i>

It certainly is.

God, you're such a geek.
Ow.

Oh, you're such a slut.
[ pot jingles ]

Hey.

I'm a slut?
Ow! Jesus christ.

Not now, please.
Ow.

Ow! Geez.
That's enough. Stop.

I think you, like,
splintered my tibia
or something.

[ knocking ]

Who is that?
I don't know.

Could've helped you.

[ laughs ]
hey, hey! Whoo! Whoo!

It's a party!
Holy shit!
[ slaps ]

What are you doing here?
This is awesome!

What are you doing here,
arnie?
Wow!

I was wondering,

Why the hell are you
beating the crap out of each
other and laughing about it?

She hit me first.
Mmm.

That's one question.
<i>Dos</i> question.

How are the world's
two biggest losers livin'
in this neighborhood?

You are wasted, arnie,
and I think you should go home.

You can't wait
for me to go, can you?

Well, I think it's a little late
to just drop by.

Really. Hold that.

No! Arnie!
Still want me to go?

Don't touch that, arnie!
Arnie! Arnie!

Just give it to me.
Please, please.

Do what he says, arnie!

[ chuckles ]
give it to me! Please!

No! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

â™ª [ pop ]

Arnie! Arnie! Arnie!

Arnie,
bring your ass back here!

Arnie,
please give us our teapot!
Arnie!

Please give me back
my teapot, arnie!

Why do you even care
about this thing so much?
[ john ] because we like it.

This is what we look like
when we like something.

Oh. God, alice.

You used to be so hot
in high school,

And then this guy
turned you into
some weird freak-o.

Freak-o?

You're not better than me.
No.

Remember that.
Course not, arnie.
Look at your truck.

Yeah, I know.
[ chuckles ]

[ chuckles ]
hey, john, remember when
you tried out for football?

And you sucked?

Go long.
Yeah! Yeah.

Down!
No, no, no! No, arnie!

Set!
No, no! Don't throw that!

Hike!
[ grunting ]

Arnie, please be careful!
No!

Arnie!

[ revs engine ]
arnie!

Arnie! Arnie, don't do it!
Arnie!

Whoo!
Arnie!

[ screams ]

No!
Enough, arnie!

No. My teapot!

<i>[ voice whispering ]</i>
<i>[ ringing ]</i>

[ alice ]
no, my teapot. My--

[ panting ]

It's perfect.

Not even a scratch.

How is that possible?

It's not possible.
[ chuckles ]

It--
what the hell is this thing?

<i>[ voice whispering ]</i>
<i>[ ringing ]</i>

Please, come in.

That teapot has been
around for 2,000 years.

It has gone through the hands of
some of the greatest and worst
characters in history.

Although we have not seen it
since it disappeared from a nazi
concentration camp in 1945.

Our founder,
dr. A.K. Bhardwaj,

Learned that in the wrong hands,
it could cause great harm.

If there is one ounce of evil
or hatred in either one of you,

The teapot
will draw it out.

We're in total control.
We're good people.

This is how
it always starts.

John and I know our limits.
They all did.

[ john clears throat ]
so, what do you suggest we do?

Give it to me.
[ chuckles ]

Go back to your lives
and pretend
it never happened.

I told you
this was coming.

I will
rid the world of it.

You can
get rid of it?

It cannot be destroyed.

But it can be hidden
in such a way...

That no one
will find it again.

Ever.

No. Absolutely not.
We are keeping it, john.

Why are we better
than the people
who had it before us?

It's a magic teapot,

Not an atomic bomb.

[ sighs ]

I didn't believe that guy.
I don't trust him.

He wants it for himself...
Or maybe even north korea.

Did you even
think about that?
[ scoffs ]

Hey.

We're
john and alice macy.

We're the salt
of the earth.

Frickin' good guys.

It's not gonna get
out of hand, okay?

I'm so annoyed
you went skiing
and didn't even invite me.

I'm sorry.

You know,
it was switzerland,
last minute.

Yeah.

Oh, mr. Smoothie!

I love mr. Smoothie!

That's so childish, right?

No. It's like
mall gourmet.

I know.
[ laughs ]

Hello!

Hello?

[ scoffs ]
hello.

You can never get anyone
to serve you
in these places.

Oh.

I, uh, ducked when
I saw you guys coming...

So we could avoid this.

What happened to you?

Uh--
I had a skiing accident.

It's a tough life.

What are you
doing here, louise?

What am I doing here?
Um, it's a second job,
you know.

And I save money
because I get to eat
smoothies all day.

I have
a chronic brain freeze.

Bit of advice, louise?

Yeah.

Don't eat the merchandise.

Make it a treat.

Um, could I get
a nonfat yogurt smoothie...

With maraschino cherries?

Why not?

So, you want
the same thing, right?
Yeah.

 <i>Dos.</i>
<i>- You ladies are in luck...</i>

Because we're having
a two-faced special today.

[ laughs ]

[ glass shatters ]

[ door opens ]

John.

John, there's
someone breaking in.

There's someone
breaking into the house.

Huh?
[ glass shattering ]

[ clanging ]
yeah. Bet it's 50 ninjas.

Good night.
Are you serious?

Do you not hear that?
[ footsteps approaching ]

They're coming upstairs.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Shh, shh.

[ metal scraping ]
[ shorter brother ]
amateurs.

They hid it
in the bathroom.
You found it.

It's the brothers again.
What do we do?

They're taking my money.
Shh. Our money.

No. I'm not going
out there.

Alice! Alice!
Go!

[ laughing ]

What are you going to do,
tough guy?

Oh.
[ chuckles ]

Back off.

Tiny underwear.

Did you shave
the top of your thighs?

[ both laughing ]

[ john ]
alice, get back inside.

Would it have made
any difference
if we'd warned you?

You knew we had
the teapot the whole time?

You were creating
our rightful inheritance.

So we'll just take the cash,
and you can keep that beast.

You don't even want
the teapot?

If you're smart,
you'll get rid of it
before it's too late.

[ shorter brother ]
bubby waited too long.

A woman of her age,
she should have been relaxing,
playing mahjongg or something.

Instead she was out every night
sawing off stop signs,
hoping for the worst.

Wha--

Don't say
we didn't warn you.

No one leaves!
Take it easy now, huh?

Take it easy?
That is my money!

Mine!

[ groaning ]

Oh!

[ grunts ]

No, baby!

No. Don't touch it.
[ alice ]
oh, my god.

Wait!
Where are you going?

Give that to me.
That's mine!
Come on! Now!

That is my money!

Give that--
what are you doing?

[ grunts ]
give that to me!
Come on!

It's my money!

[ snorts ]

[ alice crying ]
[ groans ]

[ grunts ]

[ groans ]

[ groans ]

Alice.

Alice?

Alice.
[ crying ]

Are you okay?

Baby--
they took everything!

Why didn't you stop them?
[ crying ]

[ jingling ]

Seriously?

Hi, honey.

We need to talk
about your lawn.

Now, the block council
sent three letters,

And everyone has been
talking about it.

The gardener didn't show.

[ cell phone rings ]

It's my office.
I have to take it.

So you'll take care
of this, right?
Of course.

Great. Hey, mar.

Oh, great.

Bitch.

We need
to get to work.

I have been working
since 7:00.

Is it still, uh--

Less today than
it was before?

Yeah. It's only
fives and ones.

The teapot doesn't like
paying like it used to.

[ inhales, exhales ]

I--

We need help.

[ man on jukebox ]
â™ª living's for the living

â™ª dying's for the dead

â™ª I'll tell you right now

How's it going?

Who's the toughest,
meanest, baddest motherfucker
in this place right now?

Big fella back there.

He just got out of prison
for murder.

Huh.

Two whiskey shots, please.

â™ª [ whistling ]

â™ª I'm telling you
<i>how it is â™ª</i>

Call 911.
Hey, babe, wait.

Don't forget that.

Right.

[ laughs ]

â™ª been ridin' with the devil

â™ª been such a long time

You are cute.

Oh! Oh!

[ bar patrons ]
whoa!

Whoa!

[ fist smacks ]

[ laughing ]

Heavy flow day, john?

[ laughs ]

You know, it--
[ laughs ]

Hello, john.

Jesus christ! Whoa.

Hi.

You don't look so good.

Feel like a million bucks.
You are changing.

The teapot is consuming
you and your wife.

Trust me.
Your whole life will
be destroyed by this object.

You will have nothing left.
What then?

[ bell rings ]

Charles graves. Hey!

Got time for an old pal?
Barely.

Got you working
pretty hard here, huh?
Yeah.

Pulling 60-hour weeks
so louise can go back
to school.

But, uh--
jesus.

How's things
on easy street?
You'd be surprised.

What happened?
Did good luck
finally run out?

Well,

It's not so much bad luck
as it is just--

What the hell happened
to your face?
Your eye is, like, hanging out.

I'm fine.
What is going on
with you, man?

I'm your best friend.
I haven't seen you
in forever.

You show up looking like
the phantom of the opera.

What the hell
is going on here?
Chuck, I would--

I would tell you everything
in a second,

But I just--
I just know for a fact...

That you'd never
ever believe me, and--

Whatever it is
that's going on,
it doesn't matter.

It's not worth it.
Do me a favor.

Relax for a minute
and remember
what's important, okay?

Look, if you need
a job or something,
you can work here.

It pays shit,
but at least
the benefits are--

No, there's no benefits.

[ boy ]
yo, james, ollie off the curb!

Yeah, but I got it.

[ groans ]
oh, my leg. Ow!
[ jingling ]

[ groans ]

All right,
let me do it again.

That one hurt.

That is not
grown-up behavior.

â™ª [ humming ]

[ alice ]
what are you doing, baby?

Let me ask you
a question.

Why am I gonna end up
like muhammad ali?

Just so we could have
a good credit score?

Stop being such a baby.

Move over.
I'm about to do my laps.

Wait, baby.

Jesus christ.
What, did you get shot?

I'm fine.

Who isn't fine?

Skateboarder.
[ laughs ]

[ bell dings ]

Ohh!
Yeah! Come on!

Come on!
Tear that pussy apart!
Yeah!

[ bell dinging ]

[ beeping ]

[ buzzing ]

[ chuckles ]

Okay,
you're doing good.

[ screaming ]
push!

[ doctor ]
that's good.
Come on! Push!

Security.
Who the hell are you?
Goddamn it! Oh!

Oh, wow.

Where else is there
awful, horrible pain, john?

Alice, I wanna go home.
I'm done.
No. No.

We have to keep going.
I feel energized.

Ever since
I first touched it,
you know,

Everything's... Louder.
 <i>[ voice whispering ]</i>

I never wanna lose
this feeling.

There's so much hurt
out there.

Alice. Alice!

Such a nasty world
that we live in.

Alice! Alice!

Hey!
[ man grunts, mutters ]

What are you doing?
What the hell was that?

He was crossing
against the light.

So we should kill him?
I--

Alice, we said we'd stop
when it got out of hand.

You're on the verge
of vehicular homicide.

Bearded maniacs are stealing
money out of our toilets.
I'd say it's out of hand.

Goddamn it, john!

I knew that this
was gonna happen.
I knew it.

You--

What?

You can never
go the distance
with anything.

You make all these big plans
and promises,

And you never even took me
on a honeymoon.

Well, I'm sorry.
I've been working my ass off
so you can get your degree.

Well, for as hard
as you work,
you never get ahead.

How is that possible?

Well, maybe if I didn't
have to support a wife
who just sits at home...

Thinking about how
she should start at the top
instead of at the bottom,

Like the rest
of the sane world--
you know what?

[ tires screech ]

Screw you!
Okay, you're gonna
get out of the car?

Yeah, I am.
I hate you right now!

Baby, get back in the car!
I don't wanna be around you!

No. I'm getting
out of the car.
Please come back.

[ john ]
you're losing your mind.

Watch out.
Oh!

Alice.

You okay?

I'm fine.

Where did this come from?
I don't know.

I'm sorry for this
in advance.

Some men are destined
to fail, john.

And you're one of them.

I think the lottery exists
because of guys like you...

Who know deep down
luck is the only way...

They're ever gonna overcome
their spineless, clueless,

Hopeless personalities.

We both know...

That I know...

You know I am too good for you.

Ouch.

[ jingling ]

[ laughs ]

Okay.

Now you do me.

What?

Hurt me, john.

No.
John.

Hurt me.

Don't do this here.

It's psychological warfare.
The teapot really likes it.

Hey.
What?

You got secrets, right?

Break my heart, baby.

Uh-uh.
I need a man, john.

New year's eve.

Four years ago.

You were ignoring me
at the party.

And when the ball dropped,
I grabbed payton...

And I kissed her face off.

And I still think about it.

Sometimes
when I'm kissing you.

[ jingling ]
oh.

That was a good one.
[ chuckles ]

Oh, no.

[ sighs ]

Last spring,
when we were drinking...

And playing cards
with my friends,

The reason why I insisted
that we left...

When they started
playing strip poker wasn't
because I didn't feel well.

Oh, no?

Your flaccid penis
is very small.

Well, it's average size.
You can look it up.

I have.

I still have the sex tape
that I made with the girl
that took my virginity.

It's in a, uh, box
labeled "captain ron,"

Next to <i>top gun.</i>

I let arnie go down on me.

You what?

Arnie? Arnie,
as in landlord arnie?

It was three years ago,
before we were married.

Oh, my god!
[ growls ]

[ growls, inhales ]

And you did nothing for him?

I'm so sorry.

[ yells ]

What?

[ shouts ]
arnie?

What do you want?
Oh, nothing.

I've just come
to saw your dick off.

Hi. Hey, guys.
Hey, alice.

You must be brandi.

Mm-hmm.
We haven't been
formally introduced.

My name's john.
I screw alice...

Who apparently...
Blows arnie...

Who I assume rides you
like a big gorilla.

I will fucking punch you
in the neck!
Hey, this is bullshit!

Stop! Now, listen,
you got all this money,

You think you can come here
and talk to me like this?

Uh, yeah.

[ gasps ]

[ groans ]
oh!

Baby, hey.
You okay?

Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

This piece of shit
should be broken.

[ alice ]
slowly.

[ john grunts ]
[ alice ]
careful.

[ john ]
oh! Ow!
Oh, no!

Hey, that's mine.

Hey, arnie.

Yard's looking
a little shaggy.

What the hell is that thing?
Answer me!

[ door opens, closes ]

Babe! Listen.

[ brandi ]
who's the slut now?
I will kill you!

[ arnie ]
it was one time,
I swear to god.

[ thunder rumbling ]

You suck at karaoke.

Ever since I found out
about arnie,

I've been thinking about
sleeping with another woman.

I'm not sure who yet,
but I believe I have
many options.

[ jingling ]

That was not me.

Seventy-two bucks
and change.

[ sighs ]

[ thunder rumbling ]

The first time in my life
I've been totally honest
with someone.

You know,
I really used to believe...

That people on this side of town
were so much happier and better.

Wait.

They have nastier secrets...

Than you and I
could ever imagine.

[ insect buzzing ]

Well, I can't foresee this
ending badly.

[ laughs ]

You sure about this?

Yep.
It's another level.

[ alice laughs ]
[ doorbell rings ]

Oh, boy.

Well, hey, guys.
What is this?

Just open it.
Get it over with.

[ groans ]

Casper?

Your careless wife
left him in a hot car
for three hours...

When you were
out of town last summer.

How could you?

Ricky.
No! Get away from us!

[ sighs ]

Please don't
make me do this.

[ sighs ]

Fun.

[ john ]
yeah, that's this office
that we're in right now.

That's your husband's foot
in-- in josh the intern's mouth.

[ sobs ]

And that's the couch
that we're sitting on.

[ sobbing ]

That should be all right.
That should be enough.

Thank you very much.
Um, you can keep that.

[ sobs ]

[ man ]
â™ª she thinks she can

â™ª but nobody knows
<i>what lies behind â™ª</i>

â™ª the days
<i>before the day we die â™ª</i>

â™ª da-da-die, da-da-die, die

â™ª da-da-die

He has no idea
he's not the kid's father?

She got pregnant
before she met him.

Told him it was his
and said the baby
was premature.

Nine pounds, six ounces.

And joe believed her.
[ scoffs ]

Poor bastard.

Hey, honey, why don't
you go finger-knit
with the other kids...

In the other room?

Great.

See you.
Here's some lemonade.

Fresh-squeezed.

[ joe ]
hey, guys.

So, what brings you?
Are you all
in the neighborhood?

What is the haps?

[ mary ]
I know.

You're pregnant.

That's it, right?

Oh, honey, let her say it.
We've already said it
five times.

No. No, I'm not pregnant.

But we have come here
to say something.

There's a lie
in this room,

And we've come
to clear it up.

What are you talking about?

I think you know.

[ john ]
joe,

I think
there's something that...

We need to get out
in the open,

Something that alice
told me earlier today...

That-- that, uh,

I think would be better
if you knew about.

[ sighs ]

A while ago,

You--
I'm jealous
of your family.

[ sighs ]

Jealous?

In the past I've been
such a bitch to you,
and I'm sorry.

It's just that you
find happiness so easily.

Life seems so effortless
the way you live it.

It's amazing.

Oh! Do you
really mean that?

Yeah.

From the bottom of my heart.

Oh, sister.

Oh, wow.

You're gonna get your chance
to have a baby too.

Also, you guys,

We're thinking
about going vegan.

Ahh!
[ laughs ]

That's fantastic.

I'll get the recipe book.

Uh-- what?

I can't believe
I couldn't go through with it.

No, that's a good thing.
Human, even.

It set us back, john.

I've been thinking.

One big score,

We make the million...

And say good-bye
to the teapot.

[ laughs ]
don't we have enough?

Especially after today.

Okay.

Just say it.

There are pedophiles
and drug dealers on playgrounds.

We can take out
just one.

If we knock off
one low-life scumbag,

We do the world a favor.

We knock off two,
and we're heroes.

Rich heroes.

Why'd you stop?

I think I'm done.

You got to bury a body
at least six feet
underground...

[ insect buzzes, stops ]
or somebody will find it.

Alice, can you just stop
and listen to yourself
for a second?

You're talking
about killing a man.

You're talking
about burying him in a grave.

One big score, john.

One big score.

Well, I can't do this.
I can't do this.

I'm not capable of killing
a person in real life.

So I have to do it
by myself, as usual.

No, nobody has
to do anything by themselves.

You don't have to do anything
by yourself either.
Dr. Ling was right.

I didn't wanna
listen to him at first,
but I see what he means now.

You're turning evil.

There is nothing evil
about wanting more.

There's nothing evil
about that teapot.

It's precious.

What if I ask you to choose
between me and this thing
right now?

[ shovel striking dirt ]

[ insect buzzes ]

[ buzzing stops ]

I need your help.

Come in, john.

It's bad. It's--

I should have done
something more,
but I don't know--

I don't know what else
I could have done.

My father, his father,

His father for two centuries
took oath...

To find a teapot
and hide away forever.

I have opportunity
they wait lifetime for.

I found teapot
in hands of average people,
good people.

Where is alice, john?

She will want more.

Soon not just the bad people,
but those weakest.

Why wouldn't you just
break into our house
and take the teapot?

It must be given, not taken.

That is the only way
to rob it of power.

Only answer is for you both
to give it to me.

But...

That will never happen.

Dr. Ling.

Please, just tell me
what I can do
to get her to wake up.

There is no more hope.

Most likely
is already too late for you.

You're giving up on us?

I will never give up
on the teapot.

I will wait and wait...

Until the teapot destroy you,

And then I will follow it
to the next owner...

And the next.

I will knock on their door
and tell them what I told you.

Maybe they will listen.

[ shower handle squeaks ]

[ screams ]

[ screaming ]
ugh!

Ugh!

What are you doing?

Just promise me
that you'll end it.

Give it to ling,

And he'll get rid of it.

Okay.
[ whimpering ]

Ju-- please
come back in.

Stay back, alice.

I didn't kill anyone.

But you will.

We'll get rid of it.
We'll do it right now.
[ sniffles ]

Promise?

I promise.
Yeah.

[ chuckles ]

You say I never
go through with anything.

No. No. John!

No! John!

[ grunts ]

Oh, my god.

John, no, please!

My god! Oh, my--

John! John. John.

Hey. Hey, wake up.

Please.

John. John, please wake up.
[ sobbing ]

Please wake up.

Please.

I can't do this without you.

I love you.

[ sobbing ]

Wake up, please!
[ gasps ]

You're alive?

Yeah. Wow.

[ laughs ]

Now you promise
we'll get rid of it?

I promise.

I'm so ready.

[ woman singing ballad ]
â™ª if you find me here

â™ª a wreck upon your shore

â™ª would you hide me
<i>in your arms â™ª</i>

â™ª and quell the ocean's roar?

[ glass shatters ]
hey.

I hear someone downstairs.

[ alarm whining ]

I got it.

[ door closes ]
[ vehicle drives away ]

[ tires squeal ]

It's gone.
Yeah?

Arnie took the teapot.

Let's just give it
all away--

The car, the house.

Everything.
I don't want it anymore.
I miss our pinto.

Wait.

Did we just give sauron
his ring back?

You're such a geek.
No, I'm serious.

We have to deliver it
to ling ourselves.

We have to fix it.

Because we're
john and alice macy,

The frickin' good guys.

Yeah.

Yeah?
Yeah.

[ john ]
let's review.
He has at least two guns,

Probably a collection of knives,
including the kind
that curves...

Like it
was designed specifically
for cutting out the entrails...

Of smaller men
with a better developed
sense of humor.

A bowie knife?
Uh-huh.

He's the greediest
person we know,

And he has a magic teapot
that pays for pain.

And he hates us.

He certainly does.

Arnie!

Let us in!

[ insect buzzing ]
we know you have the teapot.

[ buzzing stops ]

[ knocking ]

Arnie?

[ alice ]
jesus christ.

We're too late.

Seriously?
Oh, my god!

Look at this. Money just
comes walking in my house.
I love it.

Arnie. Arnie, arnie, arnie.
Just relax.

Put the gun--
arnie, please put
the gun down.

Oh, come on.
No one's gonna miss you two.
Put the gun down.

Put it down. Listen.
Stop it. Stop it.

Just hold on a second, arnie.

This is insane.
Look at yourself.

I almost feel bad
for doing this, you know,
with our history and all.

No!
[ screams ]
arnie!

Ow!

God! Ow!

You almost look
like a man.

I am a man!

I've done things to myself
that you can never imagine,
my friend.

I've burned, I've cut,
I've mutilated...

Every inch of my body.

I've gone to the dark side,
and I have no fear.

Now, give us
the goddamn teapot.

[ spits ]

[ chuckling ]

[ laughing ]

[ yelling ]
[ grunts ]

No!

No! No! No! No!

No!
[ grunts ]

[ rifle cocks ]
settle down!

Oh, my god!

Oh, yeah.
[ arnie groaning ]

You all right?

You okay, baby?

[ arnie ]
give me this.

Okay.

[ laughs ]

[ laughs ]

Get down on your knees.

Okay. Okay.

I always wanted to say that.
It's like on <i>cops.</i>

Hi, alice.

[ laughing ]

You look like shit!

We're gonna make
so much money off you two.

You don't wanna do this.
Trust me.
Get ready to say good-bye.

No.
Sweet dreams.

Guys, you don't wanna--
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

Hey!
[ alice ]
oh, my god!

Wizards!

Give us the teapot!

I'm sorry.
Who the hell are you?

I am god's
holy representative.

Our grandmother stole
the teapot from hitler,

And these sinners
stole it from her.

So my brother and I
have come to take
what is ours.

He touched the teapot,
remember?

Hell, no. Oh, no.
Hi. You come in here,
into my house...

And you threaten
me and my wife?
Uh-uh.

You come in here,
and you threaten me? Huh?

No way.
You tell him, baby!

Give me the teapot,
and I might let you live.

Give him the teapot.
Give it to him.

Put your gun down, redneck,
and give us the teapot.

Excuse me?
What did you just say to me?

I'm gonna pop a cap
in your ass.
[ arnie laughs ]

Arnie!

No!

Oh, sh--
oh, my god!

Arnie!

[ shorter brother ]
give us the teapot!

Arnie!
Oh, no, you terrorists!

[ gunshot ]
[ yells ]

[ shorter brother ]
yoel!

[ gunshots ]

[ clattering ]

[ jingling ]

[ panting ]

What's happening?
Shh.

Arnie? Guys?

Oh, my god.

That could have been us.

Oh, my god.

<i>[ voice whispering ]</i>

<i>[ voices whispering ]</i>
<i>[ ringing ]</i>

[ both gasp ]

Let's get rid
of this thing.

[ rustling ]

Kings, queens,

Dictators, priests,

Peasants and generals.

Thousands before you
have held it.

So few have had
the strength
to let go.

Thank you.

Thank you.
