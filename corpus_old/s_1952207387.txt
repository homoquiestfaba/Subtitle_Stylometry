  

Hey DeVivo, in my office.

How's your mother doing?
It's OK with her.

They were married for 52 years.
It's the first time she's ever been alone.

How are you, how's the casload?
Good.

Most of my cases were diverted
while I was on leave.

What's this?

I'm the assistant D.A. Can you
deal with that in a hurry?  

10 
Umm, well I must have died 
and gone to Heaven.  

11 
Still looks like Hell to me, sarge.  

12 
911 Logs on... 
November 23rd and 24th.  

13 
Anything else to waste my time with?  
-Yeah, Shapiro's death announcement.  

14 
Thank you very much.  

16 
Who was he to you?  
-I don't understand.  

17 
How did you know him?  
-As a friend.  

18 
He was also a client of 
yours for 6 years.  

19 
Well, people come to this program 
to get help living with disease.  

20 
This is our holistic services unit.  
-Is this where you met him?  

21 
He was an artist... a musician.  
He played in my home town.  

22 
Matt was actually the first real
New Yorker that I'd ever met.  

23 
This is your co-pilot speaking.  
We apologise for the further delay.  

24 
We finally have our 
last passenger on board.  

25 
We will soon be deparing, but we've lost our 
position in the line up. Delay may be 2 minutes. 

26 
Thank you for flying, and I hope 
you enjoy your flight.
  

27 
Lady,I hope you have flight insurance 'cos this 
instrument is worth at least 6 times what you are.  

28 
And that's a conservative estimate. If this 
plane goes down, I'll save it before you!  

29 
Don't shake your hand at me.  

30 
Is that pot?  -Yeah. 
Who'd you think was gonna blow you? 

31 
By the way, my name's Matt.  

32 
I rented a car. I didn't have 
any money or a license.  

33 
Sounds charming.  

34 
It wasn't always such a .....  

35 
I think it's time we started a new regimen 
of Protease inhibitors right away.  

36 
Great. How many pills this time?  
-Actually, it's a lot less.  

37 
It's only ten, taken three times a day.  
Side effects are?  

38 
The usual, nausea, skin rashes, diarhoea...  

39 
and this particular regimen can also cause 
dementia,hallucinations and severe headaches.  

40 
Matt, I have to be honest with you. 
There are only two newer protocols left to try.  

41 
I think it might be time to speak 
with your family about this now.   

42 
I'm dieing. I'm dieing.  

43 
Matt, these medicines were 
designed to prolong life.  

44 
And they've worked for you, but they 
were never meant to be a cure.  

45 
Well ..... thank you.  

46 
Out withthe old, in with the new.  

47 
Brain tumors eventually killed Matt.  

48 
Mr. Knight, three other patients have died 
rather suddenly in the six last months.  

49 
Eddie Suarez, Terry Quinn, John Butta.  

50 
All my patients die.  

51 
The police are not investigating right now, but they reported to the District Attorney's office...  

52 
that autopsies revealed similar toxicology reports...
Dilaudid and morphine in the blood of two patients.  

53 
Well, they all take similar medications.  

54 
Such large quantities?  

55 
These people suffer in ways we can't even imagine.  
The drugs are there to ease the pain... Excuse me.  

56 
New applications for drugs assistance.  
These are Bobby Tella's ashes.  

57 
His family never came to pick them up.  
You can add them to the collection.  

58 
The Board of Health is coming this week, and since 
we are not ready I have sent a memo to all staff.  

You know, clean up your paperwork... 
files off the floor...  

60 
You know, what is wrong with these people?
And why can't they cut us some slack? 

61 
We got a huge waiting list to get in here, and I got 
to worry about some anal retentive with a checklist?  

62 
Sorry I have to ask you to do this for me...  
-Don't worry about it, mom.  

63 
Your father was the handyman...
and I was the cook.  

64 
Daddy - he could burn water.  

65 
He made spaghetti only once. Two years later 
I was still cleaning up the sauce.  

66 
Mom, how come the toilet blocks 
every time I flush??  

67 
Know how many rolls of toilet paper she has in there, Nick? Hundreds. Like she's stockpiling for a war. 

68 
Your father ruined those pipes... 
A colon like an express train.  

69 
Thank you, Nicky.  You too, Chris.  

70 
Getting old SUCKS!

71 
Is that her? ... Mr. Metzler, you called 911. 
Se we just have to do a follow up.  

72 
The 911 log said that you were a woman. I'm concerned 
that an NYPD officer had such bad eyesight. 

73 
Either you lied to them...
Or you lied to me.  

74 
I'm very pissed off when I'm lied to.  

75 
Would you like some water?  

76 
The 911 report says there was some emergency.  

77 
But then, the next day 
there was a dead body.  

78 
Did you call 911?  
Oh, I'm so sorry, there's been a mistake. 

79 
There's no emergency. We were fighting 
My friend has been drinking.  

80 
Are you gonna be okay, Ma'am?  

81 
I am so sad.  

82 
Get up, Rory.  Come on. Get up.  

83 
He'd lost his breath, that's all.  
I never saw a dead body before.  

84 
I thought when someone dies, you call 911.  

85 
Rory, could you tell me who 
Mr Shapiro's next of kin is?  

86 
Hi, I'm Nicole DeVivo, 
from the District Attorney's office.  

87 
I'm looking for Mrs Lila Shapiro.  
Is she in?  -No.

88 
Can I come in anyway?  
No. 

89 
What are your names?  
Amelia.  

90 
Lilian.  

91 
Hi, Amelia.  Hi, Lilian.
Hi.  

92 
Can I come in?  
Okay.  

93 
That's really good.  
Thank you.  

94 
Amelia, Lilian, what have I told you?  
You don't let anyone in this house except me and Polly.  

95 
Who are you?  

96 
I'm Nicole DeVivo, from the 
Distict Attorney's office.  

97 
I'm looking for Lila Shapiro.  

98 
My mother is out of town.  
I'm house-sitting. Indefinitely.  

99 
Something I can help you with?  

100 
This concerns Matthew Shapiro' death.  

101 
Did You know him?  
I'm Mattie' sister.  

102 
Mrs.... Ms Gabrielle Shapiro-Schnell.  

103 
Were you with Matthew when he died?  
I beg your pardon?  

104 
There are some concerns 
surrounding Matthew's death.  

105 
Matthew had Aids.  

106 
Did he die from Aids?  

107 
My brother was very sick and very depressed. So what 
that he took a handfull of pills and killed himself!  

108 
All the terrorists in New York... 
You got nothing better to do?  

109 
You push the green button, mom.
Oh, great.  

110 
You lied to me. I can't believe it.  
You effing lied to me.  

111 
Oh, Hi Gaby.  
-You said he committed suicide.  

112 
Okay, the cops have been.  

113 
I have to go now.  
-Don't you dare hang up on me!  

114 
Well, this looks like a good spot.  

115 
You know, this is against Jewish law.  
It's what he wanted, mom. You can't uncremate him now.   

116 
Say goodbye to your brother.  

117 
'Bye then, Mattie, Mattie. 
Go feed the fishes.  

118 
Ugh, GROSS!!  
He was always a messy kid!  

119 
The Event

120 
You want Sophie?

121 
What are you doing here?  
Having a party.  

122 
You're a little late.  
Yep?  

123 
Well you... are fucked.  

124 
It's weird being here without him.  
Don't touch anything in the bedroom.  

125 
Do you think Matt's gonna haunt this place, 
when the next tenant moves in?  

126 
Only if they're straight.  
Brian, why did we all leave in such a hurry?  

127 
'Cos I'd a visit yesterday from the DA's office.  
They're looking into Mattie's death.  

128 
I knew it, I knew it.  
Didn't I tell you, Judy? Didn't I?  

129 
Well, at least Andy's not gonna say: 
"I told you so."  

130 
Probably just a routine follow up.  

131 
They don't know that any of you were here,  
so let's just keep it that way. - Damned right! 

132 
There is one problem.  

133 
Oh no.
Lorna, let me finish.  

134 
Gaby was here today.  
She knows about the party.  

135 
This is everybody, right? 
You're forgetting someone.  

136 
Who?  
Can I ask a question about the Village People.  

137 
This is why I don't smoke.  

138 
Oh my God, Rory...  What if he knows everything?  

139 
Rory's a big mouth.  
A huge mouth, especially when he drinks.  

140 
We're dead.
How did America not know they were gay?  

141 
They were gay,right?  

142 
Actually, not all of them.  

143 
MA!

144 
Oh my God.
Boy, Amelia's handwriting is really improving.  

145 
We have discovered three, er, other situations...  

146 
that are very similar to Matthew's.  

147 
I only know about my son.  

148 
Mrs Shapiro, I know this 
is very hard for you.  

149 
So I'll try to be brief.  

150 
How long were you aware that Matt was sick?  

151 
That stuffing was great!  

152 
I think it was the fennel.  

153 
You know fennel?  

154 
Your Aunt Claire introduced me to fennel.  

155 
Mom, I'm gay.  

156 
I know.  

157 
I've er, I've known for a long time.  

158 
Gaby told me years ago.  
What, she outed me?  

159 
Well, the last girl you brought 
back was a Prom date.  

160 
and you did her make up.  

161 
My sex life is none of Gaby's business, mom.  

162 
Gaby has very definite ideas like your father.  
God rest his soul.  

163 
I love you.  

164 
There's something else...  
-What?  What something else?  

165 
I'm sick.  

166 
I'm sorry, mom..  

167 
No, no, Mattie.  No, no, no.  

168 
Excuse me.  

169 
So, was he really sick?  
Oh, okay, let's see, um...  

170 
Yeah, I guess things pretty 
much went downhill from there.

171 
I have an audition..  
-Yeah? For what?  

172 00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,829 
A job, a commercial for a promising new feminine 
hygiene product. -- Is this important?  

173 
I don't any money to lend you.
Go ask mom.  

174 
I told her.  

175 
What? That you're gay?  No.  

176 
She cried, didn't she?
Oh my God, I can't believe that I messed up.  

177 
Dana, I've got Aids.  

178 00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,709 
No, don't you say that again, you motherfucker.
   
179 
Fucker, fucking stupid!  

180 
Are You ready?  

181 
Can I start in a minute??  

182 
Okay, fine.  

183 
Dana wants a minute.  
And action.  

184 
When I get a yeast infection, 
I use Vagimar.  

185 
It melts the itch away like butter.  
Cut!.  

186 
Margarine.  

187 
Margarine?  What's the difference?  

188 
It's my crotch. What? Am I gonna 
fry eggs down there or something?  

189 
I'm sorry, who says margarine? 
Who says that?
  
190 
Sorry, it just feels wrong..  

191 
Okay, okay. No, no, I see that. I see where you're going. It's good... 
  
192 
I'm glad that you're thinking. 
That you are getting inside the character there.  

193 
A girl like this would probably say butter. But, er... 

194 
I'm gonna ask you, this character in the world that we're 
creating here...  

195 
She's only got one motivation, right?  
Got one thing on her mind...  

196 
Spread Vagimar.  

197 
Now, let me ask you this...  

198 
Vagimar is called Vagimar because 
it melts like margarine.  

199 
'Cos if it melted like butter, 
it would be called Vagibutt.

200 
And Dana, how many women that you know
would pay nineteen dollars...  

201 
To spread some yellow gluck 
called Vagibutt up their hole?  

202 
Are we on the same page now?
Great.  

203 
And action.  

204 
When I get a yeast...   

205 
When I get a yeast infection...  

206 
When I get a yeast infection...  

207 
That's beautiful, honey.  
That's gonna sell a lot of Vagimar.  

208 
This isn't really helping me.  
I'm sorry to have bothered you.  

209 
I don't know much about Aids, 
but I do know there's nothing more tragic...  

210 
than when someone takes his own life.  

211 
What you know about Aids,
could fit in my purse.  

212 
Wait...  

213 
Quickly, like bunniess.  

214 
Nick DeVivo, District Attorney's
office, New York.  

215 
Mom...  
-What?  

216 
I'm cold.  

217 
I was surprised to hear from you.  
I'll bet you were.  

218 
This won't take long. Since the game is over 
my ex istaking the girls to karate.  

219 
Listen, I want you to stop bothering my family.  

220 
Amelia, stop that. 
You stop stepping on your sister's head  Share!  

221 
Listen, it's just a case to you.  
He was my baby brother.  

222 
Did you know your brother was going to die?  

223 
Where did you get these?  
Keep your paws off my goods.  

224 
So, what's it like to be a gay divorcéé?  

225 
It was ten years of hard work.  
And what have I got to show for it? Nothing.  

226 
No credit card, no house.  I live 
with my mother in New Jersey.  

227 
You have got two beautiful kids   

228 
You know what my new therapist told me?
  
229 
That men turn gay because when they first start to masturbate...  

230 
they pull on their thingy too hard.  

231 
No woman's thingy can give them 
the same sensation.  

232 
Oh .. she's worth every penny you pay.  

233 
Don't leave me out there. I've missed the 
conversation about my lack of direction.  

234 
Now they're on to your divorce. I'm sure we'll end up 
with the old family favorite: Where's Matt's girlfriend.  

235 
Well I am not sitting next to cousin 
Stevie anymore.  Dana, you do it.  

236 
He smells like Vicks vapor rub.  
No, I think that's Grandma.  

237 
You mean the bearded woman?  
That's us in forty years, Dana.  

238 
Stevie smells like pot.  - Oh good, I'll sit 
next to him then. Come on, dinner's ready.  

239 
God, thank you for providing us with this meal and bringing the family together.  

240 
And let us not forget those that aren't here.  

241 
Your Arthur, my Ethel...  

242 
and, of course, our father.  

243 
As long as you have your health, 
you have everything.    

244 
Mattie's gonna help mommy clear the table.  
You eat, young lady.  

245 
Good girl.  

246 
Matt was in pain. But I thought that it was going to 
be a quiet, respectable suicide. Like Jackie O had.  

247 
I don't effing believe it.  It looks like one of those parties.  

248 
I swear.  

249 
Was Matt Shapiro your boyfriend?

250 
Well, Brian?  

251 
No, he was my client.  

252 
May 2001

253 
And I don't sleep with my clients.  

254 
Hi, this is Brian Knight. 
 
255 
It'd better be good news, 
or I don't want to hear it.  

256 
Brian, hi. It's Dana Shapiro. Look, I'm sorry 
to bother you, but Mattie is really sick.  

257 
He won't get out of bed and he won't 
see the doctor.  I'm really really worried.  

258 
One day he's OK, and then the next 
he's throwing up everything.  

259 
He gets these twitches. 
He blames his brain tumors.  

260 
That's NOT good news.  Matt's my best friend.  

261 
Last week he was fine.
  
262 
He's really weak.  The new 
cocktail - I don't think it's working.  

263 
Dr Fisher said he's gonna die.  

264 
God, she's a fucking bitch, you know. Not fair, 
Brian. Nobody should have to live like that. 

265 
I've got to get going.  

266 
Mattie... Visitors.
Mattie  

267 
Oh, you wreak.  

268 
Brian...  Shit.

269 
There's blood in it.  

270 
Timing is everything, Mattie.  

Where's mom?  
She's got the girls.  

272 
Where's the artist?  
I want a smiley face.  

273 
Hold still.  
Hey, look at me.  

274 
I am in a plastic.bubble. 
Think what it did for John Travolta's carreer.  

275 
Dana, we're not supposed to touch him.  
Yeah, well screw it.  

276 
It's cold under there.  
I'll call the nurse.  

277 
Christ, Dana...  

278 
What do you think you're doing?  
Oh my God. Mattie, I'm so sorry.  

279 
Get away from him.  
Mattie, it's okay. It's okay  

280 
Look what I found in the mail.  

281 
You lied to me, Brian.  

282 
Yeah. Guess I did, didn't I?  

283 
Nothing personal. 
It's a lot more complicated than you think  

284 
Oh, I think it's very complicated.  

285 
Yes, there was a party.  

286 
July 2001

287 
I now confirm that you, Amy Eisner and you, Mona Rothschild have entered into a domestic partnership  

288 
Acknowledged by the city of New York. 
Congratulations! 

289 
It's about as romantic as a bank merger.  

290 
Till death do us part.  

291 
Hello sweetie.  
Good to see you.  

292 
Thank you for coming, Leo.  

293 
I know you're very busy.
I'm never too busy for you.  

294 
Uncle Leo, this is a hard one.  

295 
Mattie wants us to settle
up his affairs.  

296 
Settle his affairs? Is he being sued, 
getting married , or both?  

297 
No, Leo.  Matt is sick.  

298 
Sick?  

299 
He's a young man.  
My Stevie is 25, 26.

300 
Sick...  You take him to the doctor. 
I'm the lawyer in the family.  

301 
We need something called a Living Will. 
Is that what he called it, a Living Will?  

302 
Yes, mom. No more hospitals.  

303 
Look, I think Mattie is over-reacting a little. 
Don't you, Lila?  

304 
He has Aids, Leo.  

305 
Uncle Leo?  

306 
Is he a fag lover?  
-Yeah, uncle Leo.  

307 
Mattie is a fag lover.  

308 
Lila, how could you let this happen?  
It's not mom's fault.  

309 
I know. I'm sorry.  

310 
It's just...  

311 
Lila, it's such a heartbreak.  

312 
How sick is he?  

313 
You look. You tell me.  

314 
He's here?  
-What are you doing, Leo?  

315 
Well, shouldn't he be in a hospital?  
Tell me he's kidding. Please, tell me he's kidding.  

316 
Look, Lila, you're my sister and I love you.  

317 
But this, in our family...  

318 
No!  No, not in my family.  

319 
Shut the hell up, uncle Leo.  
Dana, don't raise your voice to your uncle.  

320 
You know, Leo. 
Sometimes you can be a real asshole.  

321 
Lila...
Now take that schmut away from your face and sit down.  

322 
I'm gonna have this conversation just once.
And then never again.

323 
Matt is sick and he is gay.  

324 
If that's a problem, it's not mine.  

325 
When you hurt your back, 
who shovelled your snow?  

326 
Who visited dad every weekend
at the nursing home?  Matt.  

327 
My son.  

328 
So, from now on... not one 
bad word about... my son.  

329 
Now, I need you to help me 
with this Living Will.  

330 
And quickly...  

331 
Because right now...
I can't stand the sight of you.  

332 
September 2001

333 
Do you want to play?  

334 
Barbie.  

335 
Are we expecting someone?  
It's Mona.  She called earlier.  

336 
You told her we were here?  
I answered the phone, Brian, so yeah.  

337 
Whose  Mona?  - She's Matt's therapist. 
He's got a session with her. 

338 
Mona's not a therapist. She's  
a death cult leader in training.  

339 
Guess I'd better get up.  

340 
I'm here for Matt's psychotherapy session. 
Hi. 

341 
This is gay Bob. And today Gay Bob's going to 
go to the doctor 'cos he's feeling kinda sick. So...  

342 
Okay, let's go to see Dr Barbie.  
But I want to be gay Bob.  

343 
Okay. You can be gay Bob, 
I can be Dr Barbie.  

344 
Hello, gay Bob. How are you doing today?  
I don't feel so good, I feel sick.  

345 
I've not got the time to talk now 'cos 
I'm going swimming in Ken's pool.  

346 
Here's a new drug cocktail. Here you go...
Take a thousand of those with every meal...  

347 
and call me when you're sick again.  
-I do not want to be gay Bob anymore.  

348 
Look, here's a red ribbon. Congratulations gay Bob.  
-Mona is here.  

349 
Er, okay. Come here. Do you remember that 
video we used to watch of Pee-wee's Playhouse? 

350 
Remember, when he said the magic word, he could 
yell and scream. You remember that? 

351 
Okay,today's magic word is...
   
352 
"Death".  

353 
We've actually met before.  
Did we?  

354 
But that was when I was still in school.  

355 
I graduateded with honors, 
got married, got divorced...  

356 
Became a lesbian and now I run a counselling 
service called Forever Positive.  

357 
I'm also a Clinical Psychologist.   

358 
It's very positive having the children here.
Very positive!  

359 
Now I remember you.  

360 
It's important to use plain terms when discussing difficult topics with the children. Like dieing.  

361 
We talked about it. THIS one does. How 
Auntie Dana feel about Uncle Mattie dieing?
  
362 
Pissed off.
Oh.  

363 
Very open!.  

364 
You are a very intelligent little girl.  

365 
But we shouldn't impose our feelings
on to the children.  May I?  

366 
I minoreded in child psychology 
Be my guest.  

367 
My name is Mona.  

368 
Now, I'm gonna ask you a question.  

369 
Take a second, then 
discuss your feelings.  

How do you Amelia feel about 
your Uncle Matt's death?  

371 
They're good.  

372 
Life.  

373 
Death.  

374 
Plate....letss.  

375 
The multi talented Princess Leila.  

376 
And now returning to the stage. After 
an extended tour of outlying hospitals...  

377 
The Queen of Green, the fellow 
with the cello,  Matt Shapiro.  

378 
That's my interpretation of death.   

379 
It's a prophecy.  

380 
Don't worry... It gets better.  

381 
I need a break.  
Now?  Yeah, now.

382 00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,997 
Have you ever lost anybody close to you?  

383 
You know, my client Daniel. He lost 
almost 80 pounds before he died.  

384 
Sometimes when I held him..  

385 00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,076 
I could, I could see my 
hand prints on his body.  

386 
Did Daniel die of Aids?  
You leave him out of this.  

387 
Why? Are you hiding something, Brian?  
Just how many of these parties have you had?  

388 
Was there a party for John Butta?  Eddie Suarez?  

389 
You haven't heard a word I've said.  
It's against the law to help someone kill themselves.  

390 
A Class C felony. Second degree manslaughter.  
I don't make the law, but it's the law.  

391 
there is no law when it 
comes to dieing that way.  

392 
That's where you're wrong. 
There are a lot of laws when it comes to dieing.  

393 
Others knew that he was going to kill 
himself, and they did nothing.  

394 
Hey man, this is Rory's psychic hotline I see your future...  

395 
You and afriend joining me at The Monster...  

396 
Tonight and tomorrow for Rory's tribute. 
Two shows at 8-30 and 10-30 PM.  

397 
Five dollar cover. I'll see you there.  

398 
You sure there's nothing you want to tell me 
here, Nick, because I love you and..  

399 
What are you saying?.  

400 
How do you know?  
Everybody knows that.  

401 
Rory Metzler, that's who your looking for. 
What do I have to go in there for?  

402 
Because you look like a fag.  

403 
The fat one in the middle, 
is that Rory Metzler?  

404 
That was a great show.  

405 
Can I buy you a drink?  
Vodka tonic...  Stoli.  

406 
Two, please.  

407 
I'm Chris.  

408 
Hello, Chris.  

409 
My friend Brian said you sing here. 
Brian Knight? - Yeah.

410 
Where are you from, Chris?
Er Chicago.  

411 
Are you in the Navy or something?  

412 
Married?  - I like that.  

413 
Do You have a lot of friends here?  
Just Brian and Matt.  

414 
You knew Matt?  

415 
He died so quick.  

416 
You've got no idea.  
The whole thing just spooks me.  

417 
I miss him so much.  

418 
I would have liked to have been there.  

419 
I'd have done just about 
anything to have been there.  

420 
Really?  

421 
Honey, I tapeded the whole thing 
for my cable access show.  

422 
Can I get tickets?  
I'll sort that out for you.  

423 
And here he is, our guest of honor.  

424 
Any final words?  

425 
Yeah... To anyone that's ever screwed me up...  

426 
and there are many...
  
427 
I forgive them.  

428 
That is one classy lady.  

429 
I'm Rory. I'm A list.   

430 
So, you've got your own show?  

431 
Yes, every third week I'm on for a two 
minute segment on the drag scene.  

432 
Brian won't let me use this footage. 
Why?  

433 
You'll see.  

434 
Hey, snap out of it, Brian.  

435 
How did you find the video?  

436 
How did I find it? It's none of your business how 
I found it. I found it. I ask the questions here.  

437 
One phone call, Brian... I say indict him, 
and your life becomes a nightmare..  

438 
Already is.  

439 
Okay, Brian. You have two  choices.  

440 
You take the easy choice, you 
give me all their full names.

You take the hard choice, and you're 
gonna make this very, very difficult.  

441 
You're such a big man, Brian. 
You think you're so brave.  

442 
Who do you think you're dealing with? Hey,do you 
think Judy's brave? Do you think that Rory's brave?  

443 
How long do you think they'll last?  
And Mrs Shapiro's got to be pushing 70.  

444 
Hello everyone. This is Melissa.  
Welcome to Matt's party.  

445 
She's a riot!. Does she work with you?  

446 
I seen Amy. Whose she with?  

447 
Call my lawyer.  

448 
I'm gonna make that phone call.
  
449 
Hey, Nick. 

450 
Looks like I got a date.  

451 
Hi, handsome.  
I got your page.  

452 
Do you want another drink or something? 
-Yes, a double.  

453 
Can I get two more of these please. 
Double with rocks.  

454 
What's wrong?  

455 
The word's out, it just about ravaged my guilt.  

456 
Do you still have the tape? 
Yeah, yeah I got it.  

457 
I've been.. er shunned.  

458 
Matt's friends cast me out,
like yesterday's trash.  

459 
And they'd better be careful because I know things.
Hey, hey...  

460 
Listen, you can tell me about it...  

461 
I think you know.  

462 
Let me go.  

463 
You lied to me.  

464 
Never misuse a woman.  
I'm warning you. I'm a cop.  

465 
Yes, you're right and I'm warning you, 
never fuck with a drag queen.  

466 
Oh, oh! Easy, easy!.  

467 
I could charge them, you know.
I could put their asses in jail if I wanted to.  

468 
That's a great idea. You think sarge would give my 
stripes for getting my ass kicked by a drag queen?  

469 
A cold beer would help.

Thank you.  

470 
Smells good, mom.  

471 
Tell me again about you let my baby 
get beat up in a gay bar.  

472 
I got carried away.
Oh...  

473 
You never give up. 
You're so stubborn, just like your father.  

474 
Hey, Mom I've been meaning to 
talk to you about something.  

475 
Did Dad ever er...  

476 
Consider suicide?  
Who doesn't?  

477 
No, I mean when he was in the hospital, when 
he was in a lot of pain. Did he talk about it? 

478 
Why are you asking?  
I just want to know.  

479 
To see your husband of 52 years just wasting away like that.  

480 
May God forgive me, Nick...  

481 
If only he'd asked.  

482 
So, you've got Matt's friends and 
family out there... For what?  

483 
Are we all criminals?  
-I don't think you're a criminal, Mrs Schapiro.  

484 
Well, you're wrong.  

485 
October 2001

486 
It is good to be out, Mamma.  
I'm glad, dear.  

487 
Er... listen, I gotta talk to 
you about something.  

488 
Mom, I'm gonna do something, 
something big.  

489 
One of those big,... life changing things.  

490 
These are special cookies.  

491 
I made them with pot.  

492 
Reefer? Weed?  

493 
Marijuana gives you the munchies, and 
Brian says that you need to eat...  

494 
And it keeps the nausea away all the time.  

495 
I read it.  

496 
There's this nice lady in San Francisco.  

497 
They call her Brownie Mary.  

498 
Isn't that cute? 
Brownie Mary.  

499 
They're not bad.  

500 
My brownies always turn out so dreadful.  

501 
Where did you get pot?  
Cousin Stevie.  

502 
I think he sells it. I bought a pound. Very cheap.  

503 
I'm so thirsty.  

504 
I'm dieing, mom.  

505 
I know.  

506 
I don't want to wait.  
I want to do it now.  

507 
What are you saying?  

508 
I can feel it getting closer, Mamma.  
Everyday is harder and harder.  

509 
What if I wake up one morning and 
I can't recognize you, you know...  

510 
You remember the way it was with grandpa, he didn't 
know who we were.  I don't want to end like that.  

511 
I don't want to...  I want to do it my own way.  

No, no, no, no...NO

512 
No, don't...  

513 
You don't want...  

514 
You don't want...  

515 
Suicide, mom.  

516 
These chocolates of Gordon's 
are outrageous.  

517 
This is a friend of Matt.  

518 
Your name?  

519 
No comment.  

520 
You don't have to show my face...
Punk!  

521 
To be honest with you Mr Campbell. 

Given the circumstances, a jury would question 
that kind of behavior, don't you think?  

522 
I didn't even want to be there. 
She made me do it.  

523 
All that we're trying to do here is 
establish exactly what happened that night. 

I want you to tell me what part you played.
  

524 
Mr Matlin, Matt said he wanted 
this to be special.  

525 
Immediately I thought of a buffet.  
A buffet?  

526 
You made a buffet?  

527 
You catered a suicide.  
Shut up, Judy.  

528 
Who do you think had the most to 
gain from Matt's death? 

529 
I'd say Matt.  

530 
I'm talking about his estate.  

531 
He left some life insurance to his nieces?  

532 
Did he have anything else of value?  

533 
Friends... Mona...  

534 
Greedy sons of bitches,  

535 
Welcome to my will signing.  

536 
Come on, people we got a lot of work here to do 
today. My relatives are coming over at 2-00 PM.  

537 
And my Uncle Leo does not need to know that
I have a big, purple bong....  Dana.  

538 
Which will be the first item up for grabs...
The Master Blaster.  

539 
What's it gonna do?  Kill me?  
Actually, I've been feeling a lot better lately.  

540 
Possibly the anticipation.  
Why are you doing that?  

541 
Because I want to die while
I can still wipe my own ass.  

542 
And always leave the party while 
you're still having a good time. 

542 
Yeah... Hello.

543 
I got the TV, so don't even think about it.  
I get the VCR.  

544 
Anyone?  

545 
I got two Stevie Nicks albums
and a microwave.  

546 
Mona got some ice tongs and a feather boa.  

547 
We were not into Mattie for his inheritance.  
Miss Eisner...  

548 
Mrs ... Eisner.  

549 
Mrs Eisner, this is a very serious matter. 

550 
A lot of Matt's friends were at that party. 
He didn't act alone.  

551 
I helped Matt.  

552 
November 2001

553 
Aids Treatment. Can I help you?  
Oh, Hi, Jackie.  

554 
A dentist? Great. 
Dr Faluti.  

555 
...878 Great. Thanks.  

556 
Oh, and call me when you get the Tuinal 
from your your mom's Doctor. Great, 'bye. 

557 
Hi. This is Amy Eisner. I'm a 
friend of Jackie Dowling's.  

558 
I have this impacted tooth and 
my dentist is out of town.  

559 
How's it looking for prescription drugs?  

560 
Oh, Mona has a junkie friend who 
might be able to get us morphine.  

561 
A junkie friend...   Oh, that's good.  

562 
Take the refills from my doctor... 
and make sure you use different pharmacies.  

563 
Good.  

564 
Do you think I need a disguise?

564 
No.

565 
So tell me, do you have a departure date planned?

566 
I didn't know that undertakers 
made house calls.  

567 
This is Chelsea.  

568 
She's in terrible pain.  

569 
What happened? 
I fell off a friend's trampoline.  

570 
This prescription is for Parégorique.  

571 
It's an opium based anti-diarrhoeal.  

572 
All that jumping gave her diarrhoea.

573 
You are big boy...  
I'd go extra large. 

574 
Thank you.

574 
I could lose my license over this, you know.  

575 
Look, you can have the rest of them.
But keep me out of this.  

576 
You are part of this, Mrs Snell, 
whether you like it or not.  

577 
Look, I wasn't even at the stupid party.  

578 
I wasn't invited.  

579 
Thanksgiving Evening, 2001

580 
Have you lost your mind?  
Why? Have you found one?  

581 
Who's that? You?  

582 
You know it is?  
No.  

583 
Me neither.  

584 
This is big one in any case.  

585 
What you are planning to do, man...
It doesn't make sense to me.  

586 
How do you not know...
It doesn't make sense to me either.  

587 
Well, why don't you stop moping and do something 
about it. Get a new treatment or another doctor.  

588 
What do you think I've been doing the last 7 years?
Nothing works anymore.  

589 
Have you thought about these girls? They love you.
Their first date, their weddings?  

590 
I love the girls, you know that.  

591 
They told me the last 6 weeks that I was gonna die.
And what I've gone through since then, I can't do again.  

592 
Well,I don't know what you are planning to do, Mattie. 
But you do not include me or mom. Do you hear me?.  

593 
Mommie is talking to Uncle Matt 
right now, sweetheart.  

594 
You keep mom out of this.  
For once, think of her.  

595 
I only hope that my daughters 
will be that kind for me.  

596 
You don't have to go, mom.
You don't.  

597 
I keep imagining his face... 
What he'll look like when it's over.  

598 
When he's dead.  
Okay, Mom. Stop it.  

599 
That's it... I'm calling the cops.
I should have done this a long time ago.  

600 
Gaby,it's what he wants, okay? 
Just sit down somewhere.  

601 
I think he'll look peaceful... 
like he's sleeping.  

602 
What is wrong with you?  
Act like a mother.  

603 
You lay off of her!  

604 
Sometimes the only way to protect a defenseless child is to... 

605 
Let him go back to God.  

606 
I'm nott promising anything. That I'll be 
like Shirley MacLaine at his death bed.  

607 
Remember Terms of Endearment?  

608 
Uh-huh.. She the Academy Award for that.  

609 
What a perfect outfit.  

610 
This sort of brings out the 
Sean Connery in you.  

611 
You get out much? 
What happened the night Matthew Schapiro died?  

612 
He had a fucking blast!  

613 
Welcome viewers to a very special show. 
We are at Matt Shapiro's "Event".  

614 
The first time anyone's been inside 
one of these gatherings with a camera.  

615 
Tell me who you are.  
I'm Jodi, this is Alex, my boyfriend.  

616 
and we live together.
You enjoying the party?  

617 
What's the celebration?  

618 
You don't know?  
No, I don't know. 

618 
Oops!

619 
Be selective. Be pleasant. Be firm. 
Ther's no reason for things to get physical. Okay?    

620 
Michael Musto is definitely an A. 
As for the rest, decide for yourself.  

621 
Is Ru Paul on the A list or B list? 
If she's in drag then, A. If not, then , B.  

622 
I'm trusting in you.  

623 
Listen, later on I might not get the chance
to say goodbye, so...  

624 
Laurie Anderson is definitely a B now.  

625 
It's so much more .......

626 
.. I'm gonna be all rigt....  
Promise me you'll get some therapy.  

627 
Oh, Fuck Off!  

628 
Why I have'nt I got one?  
Why, of course, you can have a VIP pass.  

629 
Good.  

630 
I was always at my best with you.  

631 
But get a vocal coach before you screw up.  

632 
I'm serious. You don't know how 
much you're hurting people.  

633 
Count age by friends,
and not in years.  

634 
Count your days smiles 
and not your tears.  

635 
That's the last thing you're 
gonna say to me?  

636 
That, and that I'm in love with you.  

637 
Ever since I've known you.  

638 
Marry me...  

639 
HELLO... EXCUSE ME...

640 
Could I have your attention 
for a moment please?  

641 
Could we have a moment of silence...  

642 
For Matt.  

643 
Ten minutes...  

644 
...and then, to bed.  

645 
And then The Simpsons ended.  

646 
See ya.  

647 
there was so much...  

648 
love in that room.  

649 
Sometimes people die alone.. 

650 
But...  

651 
this, this...  

652 
1:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,515 
This was beautiful.  

653 
That was it..  

654 
I hooked up the IV and watched the 
liquid flow down the tube and into his veins.  

655 
You know...  

656 
That second, when I realized he was dead...  

657 
You feel so bad...  

658 
'Cos then I was dead.  

659 
Is there anything else you 
want to add to your confession?  

660 
They all killed themselves.  

661 
Eddie, John, Terry, Anita, Marty, Greg.  

662 
I wasn't there, but I know it...  

663 
See, all my clients die, but half of them won't wait.  

664 
And sometimes...  

665 
they have parties...  

666 
to say goodbye.  

667 
And, whether you like it or not, unless you 
can cure them they're just gonna keep on doing it.  

668 
Stand up and put your hands on the table.

I'd like to add something to my statement.  

670 
All right. Go ahead.  

671 
It took a few tries to get a vein. I don't 
know why Matt asked me to do it. I hate needles.  

672 
But how could I say no?  

673 
After I got it in, it was easy 
to connect the IV line.  

674 
You're telling me that you assisted a man's suicide. 
Yeah, that's right.  

675 
I hooked up the bag of Dilotit.  
Dilaudid.  

676 
The drip was so slow that 
I had to squeeze the bag to empty it.  

677 
It got all over his shirt.  

678 
He breathing became labored,  
then sporadic...  

679 
Then a death rattle.  

680 
Then he opened his eyes 
wide and he was gone.  

681 
You're really good.

681 
Really thorough 
 
682 
Your mother must be proud of him.  
She is... Thank you.  

683 
And your father?  
He passed away.  

684 
Oh, I'm sorry.  

685 
How did he die?
He didn't die, he was a police officer.  

686 
He died in the line of duty.  

687 
Your father was a hero.  

688 
To me, my son was a hero.  

689 
He had tumors growing on his brain.  

690 
Terrible seizures, and there 
was no way to help him.  

691 
Mrs Schapiro, it is unfair to lose someone 
you love, but there has to be laws.  

692 
When your father was laying there, suffering...  

693 
Did any lawyer's opinion 
matter more than the his?  

694 
What are you going to do to me?  

695 
My son is gone...  

696 
In my world, love..  

697 
is above the law.  

698 
How many of them confessed?  

699 
Six.  

700 
That would be sick if all of them did it..  

701 
What do you want me to do?  
Indict all of them?  

702 
God damn it..  

703 
There was one night, when the pain was unbearable...  

704 
The morphine wasn't doing enough.  

705 
So he asked me if I would give him a bunch 
of sleeping pills so he could end it.  

706 
He said that nobody would have to know.  

707 
Oh God, Nick.  

708 
I told him I wouldn't do it.  

709 
He was begging me, mom.  

710 
I just don't know if I 
did the right thing.  

711 
So, I followed your trail.  

712 
Did it lead you to the killers?  

713 
It scattered in the wind around Union Square.  

714 
I'm sorry about arresting you.  
Now you have a record.  

715 
I went a little too far.  

716 
And I'm sorry...  

717 
about your loss.  

718 
You think you know how 
you're gonna react, but you...  

719 
we fool ourselves.  

720 
Want to know what happened?  

721 
I love you.  

722 
I can stop this, lila. He'll wake up 
tomorrow and be pissed off but er...  

723 
He'll wake up.  

724 
Mom, he's talking to you.  

725 
Please, don't let all this be in vain.  

726 
Please... That's all I ask.  

727 
Oh My God Oh God, we're gonna do this one does it. We're actually doing this.   

728 
Mattie, wake up you son of a bitch.  

729 
Wake up you son of a bitch. 

729 
Oh Fuck! Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!

730 
He's thrown up all the pills.  
What does that mean?  

731 
Maybe you should leave.  
No.  

732 
I can't.  

733 
I can't.  

734 
Hi, Bri. If you're playing this, 
then that means it's over...  

735 
I wanted to thank you...  

736 
and tell you not to feel bad or carry what 
I did around, like it's some big secret.  

737 
You can tell whoever you need to 'cos that's your 
job. It's the survivor's jog to tell the story. 

738 
Anyway, I wrote a little piece for you.
I hope you like it.  

739 
Take care of mom. 
I love you.  

740 
The Aids crisis is not over.  

741 
Can I give you this?  

742 
The Aids crisis is not over.
Thank you very much.  

743 
Can I give you some information on Aids?  

744 
Okay, that's good.  

745 
May I give you this?  

746 
May I give you this?  

747 
Hi this is Matt, I'm in heaven now. Leave your 
message and someone else will get back to you.

748 
Hi, Mattie.  It's your mother.  

749 
I know it's silly but silly, but this is the 
only way I can still hear your voice. 

750 
I love you.  

751 
You are the light of my life.  

752 
I hope that I did the right thing.  

753 
I hope....  

754 
I think of you everyday.  

755 
Goodbye.  

756 
Goodbye, my son.
