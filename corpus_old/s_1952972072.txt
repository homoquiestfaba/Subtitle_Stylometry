A
KIMERA - Strange Seduction
The Inner Life of Martin Frost -

The house was empty.

Your friends Jack and Diane Rastall not
return home until the end of the year.

If Martin wanted to quit
New York, said Jack ...

he could stay in their homes,
How long wanted.

Martin spent three years
writing a novel ...

and his brain was tired.
He needed rest.

He had no plans.

I just wanted to spend some
within weeks, doing nothing.

To live like a rock.

But what did he know?

A few hours of silence,
some gusts of fresh air ...

and suddenly, an idea for a
story appeared in his head.

It seems to be well
that works with stories.

In a minute, there's nothing.
And next, it is there.

Inside you.

It may not have the machine
world's newest ...

but it worked.

CAN NOT BE MORE NEW MACHINE
THE WORLD, BUT IT WORKS

It would be a long story.
25 or 30 pages.

40 at most.

Martin did not know how long
need to write.

But decided to stay
the house to finish.

This was the new plan.
He would write the story ...

and would not leave until you finish.

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

No! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

I?
Hey!

It's close enough.
I'm Martin Frost.

Not that any of your business.

If you do not tell me now who you are,
I have to call the police.

You are Martin Frost?

The real Martin Frost?

That's what I said.
I have to speak again?

Because I know you, that's all.
I do not know really, but ...

know who you are.
You are Martin Frost, the writer.

Friend of Jack and Diane.

Do you know Jack and Diane?
I am a niece of Diane.

What is your name?
Claire.

Claire what?
Claire ...

Martin.

What is this?
Some kind of joke?

I can not do anything.
That's my name.

What are you doing here,
Claire Martin?

Diane invited me.
Look, if you do not believe me ...

See? Diane gave me
the key to the front door.

And why Jack gave me this one?
Because ...

Why is Jack. So.
You know them.

He and Diane are always
things like that.

Well, not like that.
I came here to be alone.

I have work to do.
And here you are ...

Well, not being alone, is not it?

Do not worry.
I will not stand in your way.

I am here for
working on my thesis.

I have read a lot.
Reading is bad for your health.

Only books of high cholesterol.
I read them without fat.

Things vegetarian.

What is your area, history of cooked turnip?

Philosophy.
Philosophy?

Chewy, but somewhat tasteless.

This weekend,
I read Bishop Berkeley.

'If a tree falls in the forest
and no one hears ...

It produces a sound or not? '
It's' The tree is really there? '.

Berkeley said that matter does not exist,
and everything is in our head.

Yes, but you do not
is in my head.

You exist and I have to divide
this house with you.

I will be very discreet, I promise.

I put my stuff in another room
and will not even notice I'm here.

Right.

You get out of my way
and I stay out of yours, okay?

If that's what you want,
is how it goes.

Great.

I work now.
Even more.

But you just said
do not want to see me.

It is a figure of speech.
It means "goodbye".

Goodbye.

Bye, Martin.

'And it seems no less evident
that the various sensations or ideas ...

imprinted on the senses, even if
have mixed or combined ...

can not exist except
in mind that a notice. '

'Secondly, it will be challenged
there is a big difference ...

between real fire
and the idea of ??fire.

Between dream and imagine themselves to
and actually be burned. '

Hello

Sorry for not being
very nice to you this morning.

I should not have acted that way.

What time is it?
Six or so.

I still have time to read.
Why we are not ...

in the living room in half an hour
for a drink?

Good idea.

I mean, since we live
with one another, let's be civilized.

She's wearing that shirt because
Berkeley is reading this week?

To have any
the next week writing 'Hume'?

No, this here is 'Berkeley.'
The philosopher I'm reading 'Berkeley.'

There is a difference in pronunciation.
No, the spelling is the same ...

then, is the same word.

It is the same spelling,
but they are two different words.

Are you trying to confuse me?
What are you saying, Mr. Frost?

He has written a story with
two characters with the same name.

So, you read that story?

You must be one of six people
the universe in the know.

It was published in a
small magazine for over 15 years.

I read everything you wrote.
The four novels and two plays.

But I just published three novels.

But there's a new, right?

You gave a copy of the text
Jack and Diane.

Diane lent to me
and read last week.

I think it's the best
thing you've done.

In other words,
Miss. Martin approves?

Yes, for sure.

Ms. Martin approves the Martin?
Yes, Martin.

Miss. Martin approves Martin.

It reads 'Berkeley' in 'Berkeley'.
Or 'Berkeley' in 'Berkeley'?

The shirt that says?
The man or college?

The two.
It's what you mean.

Or ...

means nothing.

Well, it's a way
to eliminate confusion.

Simple logic.

And eliminating one type of confusion,
is creating another.

Do not get confused, Martin,
I'm being as clear as possible.

Claire is clear.

And Claire is beautiful.
Do you?

Yes, for sure.

Every story has a format.

And the format
each story is different ...

the format of another story.

Some follow straight lines,
other circles are ...

zigzags or pirouettes.

Instead of following one direction,
the story of Martin ...

seems to be going around
around itself.

Or going into
a series of right angles ...

or going in a spiral fashion
to an invisible point in the center.

So perhaps.

Or so.

Be that as it was the story,
Martin was making ...

and each day was
going further with it.

Understanding it a little better.

And every day, he put
more pages in the pile.

And he said to him: 'If you do not believe
me, I'll show you. '

So I put the pocket e. ..

What is this?

What is what?
That noise? Have not you heard?

This!

Yes, I heard.

It's kind of a bell, is not it?

It is a bell.
Perhaps a clatter.

It seems the outside world.

I mean,
other people besides us?

I think not.
It must be an illusion.

Hello? Jack!
How are you?

Jack and Diane.

Calcutta? Are in Calcutta.

Boiler?

Diane is concerned with the boiler.

Right.

If something goes wrong,
call Jim Fortunato.

'Fortunato Plumbing & Heat'.
I see.

Glad you called,
Claire and I were discussing ...

if you was real or not.
What do I tell her?

As well, 'Who is Claire?'
Claire Martin, niece of Diane.

What?

Claire!

Claire!

What's going on, Claire?
Say what is happening.

You gotta tell me!

I'm listening.
Do not shout, Martin.

I just learn that Diane
has a sister who has two children.

Two boys, which gives
two nephews, Claire ...

but no niece.

I did not know what to do. I had to find
one way to do it trust me

I thought after a few days,
you would find yourself ...

And do not care anymore.
Find out what?

You do not understand, Martin?

We've been together almost a week.
And saying that is not understood.

Who are you?
What the hell are you doing here?

Martin, no matter who I am.
Of course it matters.

Very important.
Honey, do not matter.

How can you say that?
No matter why you love.

Because you want me,
that's what matters, right?

The rest is nothing.

Unfortunately, Claire was right.

Martin loved her and wanted to ...

but how you love someone
do not trust?

Treatise of Human Nature

The food is ready, Martin.

I'll wait for you
in the dining room.

Are you okay?

It looks good.

So Martin, how's your story?

Who are you, Claire?
What are you doing here?

No, answer my question first.
How is your story?

Please, Martin,
is very important.

Want to know?
Yes, I want to know.

Okay, I'll tell you how it's going.

It's going well.

Well? Or very well?

Very well.
I would say that is going very well.

Got it?

Understand what?
Martin, of course I understand.

No, Claire, no.
I did not understand anything.

And if you want the truth,
I am completely lost.

Martin should not be
so hard on yourself.

Not bad.
What do you think, Martin?

Damn!
I think not.

That night, Martin took one of
most important decisions of your life.

He decided not
do any more questions.

Claire asked him to trust her.

And instead of pressing it,
he decided to close their eyes and jump.

He had no idea
than expected at the end ...

but this did not mean
not worth the risk.

Then he continued falling in love.
And a week later ...

when he began to think
that nothing would go wrong ...

Claire went for a walk.

She seemed to be fine.

Only a faint
unwell, thought.

But the next morning,
Claire woke up with a high fever.

She did not complain.
His skin was hot ...

but she seemed in good humor.

After a while,
she put him out of the room ...

insisting that
returned to its history.

The next morning,
fever was worse.

Martin said he would take the day
off, whether she liked it or not.

He sat beside her
for several hours ...

and in the afternoon,
she seemed to be improving.

The fever subsided and suddenly
she returned to the old Claire.

'The things we see are not
for themselves what we see.

So if we change the subject or
the subjective form of our senses ...

all qualities, all relations
of objects in space and time ...

not only but also
their own space and time ...

would disappear. '

Martin felt encouraged.

And the next day,
he returned to his story.

He worked directly
for three or four hours.

Then he returned to the room
to check on Claire.

It was cold that day.
Much cooler than the day before.

Diane was right
in worrying about the boiler.

Martin should have called the Fortunate,
but so many things happened ...

he just forgot.

Do not want to wake you.
Sorry.

Hello, Martin.
How's my beautiful man?

You're burning.
I'm feeling good.

It is the third day, Claire.
I think we should call a doctor.

I do not need it.
Just give me some aspirin ... more

and in half an hour I'll be right.

This is not good, Claire.

I really think that
you should see a doctor.

Tell us what is
happening in the story.

This will make me feel better.
It has to rest.

Please Martin, just a little.

It's night now.
He left the house.

Anna is on the way.
But he did not know it.

If she does not get there soon,
it will fall into the trap.

She'll get?
Does not matter.

What matters is that
she is going to meet him.

She is in love with him, right?

In a way, yes.

She is putting
his life in danger by it.

It is a form of love, is not it?

How much longer?

Two or three pages.
I'm almost done.

Write them down now.
They can wait.

I do it tomorrow.
No, write now.

You have to write now.

What are you doing?

My God, Martin,
what are you doing?

I'm buying you back, Claire.

The 37 pages for his life
is the greatest bargain I've ever seen.

But you can not do that!
It is forbidden!

Maybe so, but I'll do
anyway. I changed the rules.

Martin! Martin!

You do not know what he did.

That is, Claire.
They are just words.

There were 37 pages
and nothing but words.

What do we do?

Tell me, Martin.

What do we do?

Everything will be alright.
How can you be so sure?

Why am I writing the story
and I can do it as I want.

This, of course,
have a happy ending.

But what if I never
arriving in New York ...

We should be there at 23h tonight
if the flight leaves on time.

And if no flat tire.

Bored on a trip,
we are using the spare.

More than one hole and we are screwed.

Talk about New York, Martin.
What do you know?

Where you live, to get started.
How is your apartment.

If it is large enough
for both of us.

We will have to move furniture,
but has room for two people.

And if not like,
look elsewhere.

I'm afraid, Martin.
Of course it is, I am also.

This is grace.

We go to a place
where nobody was.

And do not talk of New York.

Are you okay?

Yes, I'm fine.

I still have many
to learn about you, is not it?

I have a lot to learn about me.

I hope not to disappoint you, Martin.

I think not. I speak of a flat tire
and then it happens.

Sorry, Martin.

Maybe I'll bring bad luck.

'Sorry'?
Why would you apologize?

It's not your fault.

Well, there goes the brake.

The brake, no, Martin is a tire.

What will you do?

It has a gas station
2 or 3 km from here.

I can walk there in half an hour.

Buy a new tire in the shop.
They give me a ride back.

What about me? There I go with you?
Of course I want.

But it makes no sense you get tired.

I'll be back soon.

Sure, Martin.

Do whatever you think best.

You can sleep
in the car while I go.

Will make the time pass quickly.

Only 45 minutes,
one hour at most.

Kiss me again, Martin.

Do you love me, no?

What do you think?

Hello?

Yes, I understand.

Goodbye.

Only one person had
the post that day.

What do you mean there was nobody
to take Martin to the car.

Nice work, Martin.

He did not know what to do.

If it were to New York, he felt
the connection end for all time.

Maybe Claire had
panicked and changed my mind.

If she showed up again,
would be the home of Jack and Diane.

It was the only place she knew.

And it was Martin's only hope.

Need help?

Thanks, I think I can turn.

Take your time.
I'm just trying to help, man.

'Fortunato Plumbing & Heat.'
You are Jim Fortunato?

Himself.
I was going to call you.

The boiler in my house
is not working right.

Need of repair.

What is home?
I can not say I've seen here.

I'm just visiting.
The house is Jack Rastall.

You must know it.
He told me to call you.

Sure, I know Jack.
Why does not he call?

He and Diane are out of the country.
Are in Calcutta.

Calcutta?

I once read that the rain
India can be so strong ...

the drops are like bullets.
If you are not careful ...

you can die if they quit.

Are you taking care of the house?

I am a friend, I am in the house,
while they are away.

A friend?
And where are you, friend?

New York.
New York City?

New York City.

This makes a foreigner, is not it?
What do you mean?

I once read that New York
is only an island off the coast of Europe.

Not part of the United States.
You read a lot, huh?

All the time. In all there
in the world, what I like most is reading.

I hope you enjoy
repair of boilers.

I do not care, but is not
what I call passion, you know?

You can go to the house this afternoon?
Sorry, everything is full today.

Tomorrow, it may be.
Some time after 15h.

Okay, tomorrow,
some time, after 15h.

He spoke, man!
Even more.

Then he went home.
Claire!

And the second part of the story begins.
Claire!

Where are you, Claire?

Martin? Martin?

Are you awake?

Claire?

I can not open.
I'm stuck.

Do not worry about the door, Martin.

I just want to make sure you're well.

Well? Not good.

What happened to you, Claire?
Why did you run away?

I should not have
left me alone, Martin.

What would I do? I could not
go to the airport without a car ...

and the car needed
a new tire.

They called me back.
I had no choice.

While you were there, they do not
had control over me, but ...

when you left
and, again, I could not do anything.

But we broke the spell.
I brought you back to life.

Once that happened,
I thought it would be free forever.

That's what I thought, too.
But I was wrong.

What will happen now?
I will be punished.

For how long?
I do not know. Everything is in chaos.

They never faced
a situation like this.

No one knows what to do.

They are discussing it
provided that burned its history.

Great.
Now, I suffer too.

Just because I'm an idiot
not good for anything ...

with a typewriter, not
mean it can not meet them.

Why do I want this, Martin?

There are other women in the world.
I've been with other women, Claire.

So I've been married.

You're the first person
I care about ...

more than myself.

It's simple.

The next morning, Martin decided
write down everything you remember ...

time spent with Claire.

If he concentrated
enough in the past ...

perhaps understand
what to do at present.

I arrived early?
That came later?

No, the time is great.

No need to show me the way.
I've been here several times.

Need Help?
Do not worry.

I know the best boiler
my own mother.

That's because I am an orphan.

Here is your money.

You're a writer.
With novels published.

It is what it seems.

Martin Frost and Martin Frost.

I thought I
something familiar to you.

He could not remember
where he had seen.

Will not say that you have read my work?

I could lie and say yes,
but I heard about you.

At least it's something.
More than 'something'!

Sorry my face in amazement,
but I'm surprised.

Restrain yourself, Mr. Fortunato, will pass.

No, seriously. I am a writer.

Not published anything,
but also write.

What sort of things do you write?

Stories, mostly. Tales.
All kinds of history.

Science fiction, horror,
police, political, erotic.

As can be as creative
and have a business at the same time?

Energy, Mr. Frost.

By day, I get
the pipes, toilets, boilers ...

but at night,
I walk in my imagination.

You'd be surprised how
what a man can do ...

only when sleeping
two or three hours a night.

Give time to live two lives.
Be two men in one body.

What is the secret?
If I sleep so little, I faint.

Passion, ambition, desire.

I do not want to take advantage, Mr. Frost ...
You can call me Martin.

Marty did not?
Martin.

Sure, Martin.

Call me Jim.
No more 'Mr. Fortunato '.

All right, Jim. I was saying ...
Yes

Do not want to take advantage of you,
Martin, but I wonder ...

have the time to
take a quick look ...

in some of my production.

I do not know if my opinion
worth that much, but, of course.

Why not?
Can I get a pleasant surprise.

How long does this happen?
Years, Martin, many years.

But you're my first writer.

I used to be sent
for painters and musicians.

But there was a terrible incident
and I was transferred.

What happened?
Last year, in Paris ...

a painter named Philippe Ponge
hanged himself in the studio. 5939

I remember reading about it.

It was because of you?
It was not my fault.

I was his model, not his mistress.

When the frame was ready,
had to leave.

Whenever I'm gone
when the work is finished.

He could not handle it.
And a month later, he killed himself.

I know how he felt.
Do not be silly ideas, Martin.

I fight for us every day.
The story is not over yet.

What if I break down the door?

And if your hand caught
and pulled into the room?

There's no point. At the moment
he stepped into the hallway ...

I would not be there anymore.
The dream would end.

I do not know more
How long stand this, Claire.

They are arguing about what
do with me. There is so much confusion.

They are beginning to make mistakes.
Joining women with the wrong men.

Men with the wrong women.
Men with the wrong men.

Not to mention women
with the wrong women.

Actually, yes.

And?
I do not know.

But if we help them
to clean up the mess ...

maybe we can
make a deal with them.

Wait. How can I help?

I do not know, Martin.
Time will tell.

Martin felt that
things were changing.

The more he wrote about Claire
its presence felt more at home.

He was not a person
I believed in ghosts.

He was always a rational person.
But there were times when podiajurar ...

felt that breathing at his side.

The words he wrote about it
were to bring back?

Martin was afraid to think that.

He was not allowed more
to hope.

But without hope,
that was still in the house?

Why was still
writing the story?

It is a good time?
Or is it a bad time?

I did not want to overwhelm you,
so I decided to bring only three ...

you can call sample
representative of my work.

This is called
'The Little People of Lastman.'

Lastman is a republic
fictitious in Central Europe ...

hidden in the Carpathian Mountains.

Population: 3.5 million.
Main production: Potato.

One day, the harvest is not enough
and famine spreads throughout the country.

Dr. Anatol Karpac,
the chief scientist of Lastman ...

goes to the President
with a plan to save the country.

The problem is:
Little food, many people.

There are not enough resources.

Karpac analyzed the situation
and the conclusion is ...

the inhabitants are very large.

I'm talking about the bodies.
Their bodies are very large.

They need a lot of
food to sustain them e. ..

as there is not enough,
he invented a pill ...

that shrinks people to
a third of its original size.

Just take a pill and
a man is 1.82 m with 60cm.

1.82 If a man needs
of potatoes in 9 days ...

then need a 60cm
only three, right?

There are enough resources.

Incredible.
It is actually an allegory ...

about the environmental crisis
in the world today.

We are destroying the planet
because of greed.

Because everyone wants too.
Many cars, many plants ...

many washing machines.

The only way to save
the planet is to think small.

About what are the other stories?

This is called 'Fuck off, asshole. "

Where the hero is a detective
Sharpless named Don.

It is a classic tough guys.
Dialogues fast. Very sophisticated.

And the third?
This is the newest.

I finished last night and
must be the best thing I ever did.

'Bushataque'.
This is the title.

What do you think
as the first sentence?

'It was the morning of the third
possession of George W. Bush. '

Promising.

'Bushataque'. Got it?
Bush attack.

The story is about a conspiracy
to kill the bastard ...

that self-proclaimed
our president.

You do not like the old George?
I despise the damned.

He is a dangerous liar
and did more to destroy America ...

that any man in history.

I did not know he had a Democrat
here in these parts.

Democrat? Who's a Democrat?
I also hate those disgusting.

Vote the Socialist Party.
I am 100% trostkista.

One of the last.
Permanent Revolution, Martin.

It is the only answer
to the problems of the world.

And 'think small'?
I was talking about ...

over natural resources.
When it comes to politics ...

you have to think big.
I'm leaving you bored.

No, no, no. Not at all
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

If you want my opinion,
you are very down.

Are you a sad look, Martin.

I finished a novel three weeks ago.

I always take some
months to recover.

So, is not
writing anything at the moment?

A little.

I'm taking notes.

Getting ready for the next step.

So you get this great old house,
alone, no one to talk?

That's why we get depressed.

What you need
is a little distracting.

Maybe.

Ever heard of
'Screwdriver Darts'?

'Screwdriver Darts'?
It's a game that Jack and I invented.

It's great fun, Martin.
Maybe I will one day teach.

As a thank you
for reading my stuff.

Hi, Martin. Ready for fun?

Beautiful clothes.

The official uniform
of 'Darts Screwdriver'.

You mean Jack
have one of these too?

You bet.
But his is white.

I hope you do not mind
I refuse this pleasure ...

and stay with my
own clothes.

No problem.
As you wish.

These are the Jack.
He will not mind if you use.

Let me guess.
The goal is to hit the target.

Exactly.

There are 40 points to the red in the middle,
20 points for the Blue ...

10 points for white
and 5 points for the yellow.

The first to arrive
to 100 points wins.

We played the game for $ 50.
$ 50?

You and Jack lead
this thing seriously, eh?

If there is no risk, no fun.
Where do you stand?

Here, behind this line.

It's a bit far, is not it?
There are darts common, Martin.

Are 'Screwdriver Darts' and
to make a screwdriver ...

into that target,
you have to play with great force.

Impressive.
I'm just warming up.

Why do not you try?

Secure the blade or the cable?
For the blade.

You get a
better balance as well.

Only about half
between the line and the target.

A star is born!

You have talent, Martin.
Very proud.

Think you're ready
for a game?

Why not?

I'm sorry, Martin.

After primeirajogada,
I thought it would fare much better.

Beginner's luck.
Then it was how I actually play.

I hate to take money from you.
Forget it. You won, I lost.

It's fair.
But $ 500 is too much.

Particularly after
of everything you did for me.

I did not do anything for you.

I know I have not read
my stories, but will read.

You are a man of his word
and will not let me down.

Let's go, I will check.

I know. I'll leave
you stay with my niece.

His niece?
What are you talking about?

I do not think right pick
all this money without giving you something.

Still do not understand what
this has to do with his niece.

She is 18 and does not work.

She can cook for you,
cleaning house, washing clothes.

I would like to offer you this
in exchange for money.

It is very gentle, Jim,
but I better not.

With her around, you will no longer
be alone in this house.

But I like being alone.

I want to be alone.

PEOPLE OF SMALL Lastman.
FORTUNATO JAMES

There was nothing else to write,
nothing else to think.

All he
could do was wait.

Or give up,
pack up and leave.

You again?
I'm going to the governor's mansion ...

And I wanted you to see me before.
Elegant, no?

Governor's Mansion?
A few months ago ...

I saved a girl from drowning.
Maggie Fitsons.

Perhaps he saw in the newspaper.
Now, I get the medal ...

For heroism and bravery.
Who is she?

Not that way, stupid.
Enter the house.

My niece, Anna.
I thought I had spoken ...

I know, I know. But when he said
what was here yesterday ...

she said she wanted to meet you,
would not take no for an answer.

Talk 'hi' to Martin.
Hi, Martin.

Hi, Anna.

Squeeze his hand, dizzy.

Now, sit on the couch.

What's wrong with her?
She looks half dead.

It is a sad story, Martin.
She appeared at my door ...

there are nine months,
with nothing but their clothes.

Homeless, penniless.
It had to house it, no?

What happened?
She fled the country?

That's the problem.
She has no parents.

My sister and her husband, Al James,
died in a car crash ...

in Oregon last year.

Are you saying that her last name
is like your first name?

Yeah, so?
It's just a coincidence.

When was the last time you saw
before they appear in your home?

A long time ago.
She had no more than 2, 3 years.

My sister and I
were not very close.

How do you know that Anna is his niece?

Of course it is my niece.
Why else would come up to me?

I do not think it is
a real person, Jim.

What are you talking about?
She is ...

a spirit.

A ghost.

You're crazy, Martin.

This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

When he began
to write their stories?

I do not know, about a year, I think.
But you did not take seriously ...

Anna to begin
to live with you, right?

I thought you were
an intelligent person, Martin.

I came behind you,
wanted to be your friend ...

but what is
saying now is a nonsense.

Look at her.
Call it spirit?

She is a human being of flesh and bone.
And a real bore.

When she started living with me
she weighed 72.5 kg.

Now, look at her.
You look like a toothpick.

She barely eats, barely speaks to me ...

and never showed the least amount of gratitude
that I have received it.

Not a word of gratitude.

Lift, pea brain.

Now give me a slap in the face.

See? She likes it.
She likes to hurt me.

If you do not want to get slapped,
so do not ask her.

I'm just showing how it is.
That's it, she is an idiot.

She can barely read and write.

You can see how
she takes good care of herself.

But, believe it or not,
she has an angelic voice.

Take the hair from her face.

Sing one of your songs.

I am the girl you can see

I'm the girl that can not be

With my heart I sail the sea

And where love beginning to end

I go to China, London
In Rio, France

I live life
And dance the dance

And if you come with me

I do not give you another chance, friend

For I am the girl
You could not see

For I am the girl
That could not be

How did you learn to sing well?
I do not know.

I woke up one day and could not.

She can sing
and also know how to interpret.

Make one of your monologues for Martin.

'Lord Bassanio, as well as
you see me now, I am.

For myself, would not be
ambitious in my wish ...

want to be much better at all.

But triple wished twenty times,
for you, what I am ...

be a thousand times more beautiful,
ten thousand times more woman ...

a rich heritage.
For your concept to be higher ...

wanted to have
invaluable account of virtues ...

beauty, wealth and friends. '

Portia,
'The Merchant of Venice', right?

Excellent.

Wow, I gotta go.
The reception starts at 18h ...

and have a long way to go.

Come on, Anna,
I take you home.

I want to stay with Martin.

I'll cook and clean for him,
as you said I would.

But Martin does not want a cook.
I've said it.

I do not mind.
I like it here.

And I like Martin.
Come on, you fool, that's enough.

I changed my mind, Jim.
She can stay if you want.

At least for now.

Let's give her some day,
to see how things turn out.

Where are you from, Anna?
The home of Jim.

Before that.
Before coming to him.

I do not remember.

It rained a lot.

Oregon?
Maybe.

They never told me.
They? Who are they?

The people with whom I lived.

That's funny.
I can not see them.

How old are you, Anna?

I do not know for sure.

Sometimes I think I just born.

There are 10 minutes.

You know what I mean?

Promises to give you food when you eat?
Yes, I promise.

Right. What will you do now ...

is to go to the end of the corridor
and bathing.

Go to the bigger room.

It has women's clothes in the closet
put whatever you want.

Right? Think you can do this?
I think so.

If something goes wrong,
just give a shout.

Like this? Help! Help!

Exactly.
Just like that.

Hello, Anna.
Shall I help you?

Who are you?
My name is Claire.

I'm here because of Martin.
I do not understand.

Do not worry.
I'll explain everything.

Look at you.

That's what I call progress.

Thank you.
I could not alone.

What do you mean?
Claire helped me.

She is a very nice person.

Where is she?
You want to see it?

Of course I want to see it.

Sorry, I should not have said that.
What I meant was ...

you want to talk to her?

Is there a difference?
You can not look at it.

If you look, it disappears
and not go back.

I screwed the same things, no?

What you have to do
is uncovered eyes with this scarf.

So, it will be able to speak
with it as you want.

Can I touch it?
I guess I'm not sure.

Of course you can touch me, Martin.

You can even kiss me if you want.

Where are you?
Right here, Martin.

It was the best I could do.
Nobody wanted to stay.

It is unprecedented and they
did not know how to handle it.

I do not understand
why can not I look at you.

Because I belong to you, Martin.
To you and nobody else.

During the time that is
caught between here and there ...

they said
will be so for a year.

And what happens
when that time runs out?

If all goes well, you will be able to
look at me again.

This was the condition.

Are not always clear
as could be.

And how do you define 'work out'?

To begin with,
you have to take care of Anna.

It was how I managed to convince them.

She was sent here by mistake,
was not ready ...

and now need education,
must learn to be a person.

But living with Anna Fortunato,
he thinks is his niece.

I think Mr. Fortunato
will not object.

No?
No.

He is a horrible writer, is not it?

I think so.

Poor girl.

That's why we have to do
all we can for her.

We have to undo the damage. So
can go back and start all over again.

This is getting complicated.

What else?

No sex.
No sex for a year.

Not to sell?
No, Martin.

Only in your dreams.

But there are dreams.

Are real.

I think you're all set.

I wanted to be with us.
Makes no sense you get.

I can not go now.
But I find you in New York later.

When?
Soon, I promise.

I do not want to leave you again.
But need.

I wish I could go now, too,
I can not.

Bye, Anna.
Bye.

One more kiss.

Drive carefully, Martin.

Claire, are you back there?
Yes, Martin.

As I drive to the airport
eyes with a handkerchief?

Tire.

But if you take, you will see and
then you lose.

It will not.
I wish it were a surprise.

Mirrors do not count.

Are you sure?
Absolute.

Hello, Claire.
Hello, Martin.

Why not sing a song, Anna?
What do you hear?

Something slow and sad
busy and funny or something?

Whatever you want.
Exciting and funny.

I went south to see Salt
Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day

She is a brave girl
Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day

Bye, bye
Goodbye my beautiful fairy

I go to Louisiana
See my Susyanna

Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day
