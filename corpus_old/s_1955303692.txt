Everything OK?

Yeah, I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking.

Oh, you're welcome.

My toes are really itching
though, it's kind of annoying.

Where are we?

Pakistan.

Really?
No, not really.

You think I'm weak, I'm a
girl, right, a little girl.

Little girls are not weak,
they're very strong.

I swear to God... every day when I
wake up it seems things have sped up.

Not by much. Just a little bit.

It's almost imperceptible but I can see it.

Everything around me is slowly speeding up.

Maybe everything is the same and
it's you slowing down?

You're going to be fine, trust me.

What are you doing?
I'm helping you.

You said you had an itch.

Right... on my toes.
Exactly.

Hello?

Wes? Hey, how are you doing? It's Alison.

Alison?

Hey? Can you hang on a second?
Yeah.

Hey.

Shit, did I wake you up?
Not really.

Guess what? I'm in town.

Yeah, I've heard you were in town. I
didn't think you were going to call.

Yeah, I wasn't but... it's so silly.

I mean I'm here and I'm not
even going to say hello?

It's nice to hear your voice.

I'm leaving in the morning.

You are?
Yeah.

Do you want to drive me to the airport?

Yeah, OK. I'd love to.

Can I come in and say 'hi'?
Right now?

Yeah. There's a few hours
left, we can catch up,

bake muffins or something. I don't know.

I'm really sorry to be calling so late.
I was trying not to call at all.

So I guess I'll just finish packing my
bags and get over to your place.

Yeah.

All right. See you soon.

OK. Bye.
Bye.

It was so quiet at the canyon...

Could have stayed there forever.

Hi.
Hi. Come on in.

You've changed things around.
No, I didn't.

You didn't?

Did I?

Hello.
Hi.

There's lots of new pictures.

You've had a fun year, huh?

Sorry.

I like these blue chairs. Those are new.

Yeah.

More pictures...

She's pretty.

Yeah, she's great.

You look different. Do I like different?

What do you mean I look different?
Well I don't know... different.

You look healthy. Not that
you didn't look healthy before.

So... I guess that's not really it.

Can I take a shower?

It's kind of hot.

Wow, pretty cool place.
Yeah, it's nice.

Here, you can take this room upstairs.
It's my parents'.

I thought you lived
herewith your boyfriend.

Yeah, we live here together but
it's my parents apartment.

They let us use it because
they're never here.

They live in South Africa
now, lucky bastards.

South Africa? Wow!

So, where's your boyfriend?

He left me... for a week.

To go sailing with some
friend she hasn't seen for ages.

Like two years or something.
Can you imagine? Two years?

What's his name?
Kai.

That's a cool name. What does he do?
He designs super-computers...

Like computers that are used to
design more advanced computers.

That sort of thing...

No shit?
Yeah, no shit.

Montreal has the best vegetables.

Everybody always thinks hockey or
maple syrup when they think Canada

but really what they should
be thinking is vegetables.

I don't know. I think
'cold' when I think 'Canada'.

Friendly but cold.

Isn't that a...

What's that word for when you say two
things that cancel each other out?

There's no word.
There's a word.

No, there ain't. Strict tripping, honey.

Don't call me 'honey'. I
didn't come from a bee.

Do you like artichokes?
I'm the king of artichokes.

Well, then it's your lucky day because
I'm the queen of artichoke salad.

How feng-shui of us, huh?
The king, the queen

the kitchen is in full harmony right now.

I'm hungry.
Me too. Can I cook?

Sure, can I get drunk?
Why not?

What do you think?

You think he's going to
make USA good omelet?

The best omelet you have ever had.
Queen of the artichokes.

Do you like pictures?
Pictures?

Pictures, yes.
Sure.

Me too.

Seems odd I've only known
you for like a week.

I know, ain't that interesting?
Everything is so random.

What do you mean?
I don't know.

Some people wake up, have a nice breakfast,

decide to go to store to buy light bulbs...

Get hit by a bus and die... on a Tuesday.

To a lot of other people nothing
happens on that day.

Such a boring day to die. Tuesday.
I want to die on Friday.

Anything but Monday.
Yeah, that's got to be so bad.

How many pictures you can
take with that thing?

Like a hundred or something.

I really want to buy a new one,
with more megapixels, you know.

I love that word - megapixel.

But I'm kind of broke so I don't know.

Maybe I'm going to get one for Christmas.

Do you think it's OK to buy
yourself gifts on major holidays?

It's kind like kissing
yourself on the mirror.

'You're so pretty, I love you'.
That sort of thing.

What do you mean 'broke'?
I thought you guys were rich.

Super-computer engineering.
That sounds very expensive.

Yeah, I don't know.

It's Kai's money.

That's how I look at it. Otherwise
I'll never get anywhere.

Right now I make 7,50 an
hour working at the bookstore

but I spend it on books, Cdâ€™s and alcohol.

So I never have any money.

But you are enjoying yourself.
Isn't that the point of money?

Exactly

I really like my feet too.
Aren't they pretty?

They're great.

Oh! I have the coolest picture of my toes.
You've got to see it.

It's really cool. You're going to like it.

Where's this?
Indonesia.

We took a little vacation there a year
ago with a couple of our friends.

It was a lot of fun, we traveled to
all these little islands...

Oh, there it is! Isn't that cool?!

Wow, look at you... you're an artist!
I know.

Who's that?
Oh, that's my friend Misaki.

That's her husband, I
can't pronounce his name.

Oh, my God! The sun was so hot that day.

I tried putting coconut oil on skin

because it's supposed to
help me get a nice tan

but all I got was a nice sunburn.
Smelled really good though.

I bet.

That's me and Misaki drinking rum.

And there's me and Kai drinking more rum.

And that's me kind of really drunk.

Nice.
Yeah.

Why don't I show you New Zealand now?

I used to live there... Before I met Kai.

Really?
Yeah, really.

I had this tiny apartment right by
the ocean. It was pretty cool.

What were you doing there?
Studying... well - kind of.

Sound like you had a good time.
I had a lot of fun, yeah.

I had this great boyfriend, Alex.

He was so beautiful, he had
the most amazing green eyes.

I miss him sometimes.

We were always making love, it was... nice.

New Zealand... seems so far away.

Yeah... it's like it never
happened in a way. Like a dream.

All the things I did, all the people I met,

the millions of times I kissed Alex...

Looked him in the eyes like
nothing else mattered...

And now it's just a memory.

I'm boring you.

You think I'm crazy.
No, not really. Little bit.

You're really quiet.

Do you have cholesterol?

Cholesterol kind of numbs
your brain, you know that?

It's like chocolate but worse.

Really?
Yeah, I read it in magazine.

You need to watch what you eat.

Be more respectful of your body, you know?

Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.

Yeah, I should quit.

Do you want to go dancing?

It's like 2 A.M.
I know.

I don't dance.
You don't dance?

What... are you shy?

No.

What is this?

It's a worthy effort. I've got
good intention, you know.

Cows are great, don't get me wrong.
I love them. The bovine of choice.

I get it, really. But
I'm not sure it's you.

See, to me you look like
an idiot in costume

jumping up and down in
the middle of Pakistan.

But, look, what do I know, right?

But I will say this... And
many people will agree...

From here to Timbuktu...

If you really want to, you can fly.

Go places far, far away. By
that I mean become a superstar.

Shine up in the sky and
all that good stuff.

Superstar? I don't know.

Put your head back on.

Now repeat after me: 'I'm a superstar'.

I'm a superstar.

I can fly and shit.
I can fly and shit.

Now, go on. Go tell the world.

I'm a superstar.

I'm a superstar.

I'm a superstar.

I can fly and shit.

I'm a superstar.

I'm a superstar.

Do you like Madonna?

I like her, not when she sings.

She's vegetarian, right?

I think I'm going have to start eating
meat again. I'm always tired.

Maybe it's because you're
stressed too much.

I think you're stressed too much.
What do you mean?

I get to the gas station

and the guy there was
making fun of your shoes,

and I tried to laugh with him, you know.
You were freaking out.

I wasn't freaking out.
That guy was an idiot.

OK but you were angry. And
that has got to be stressful.

Well, I'm not always angry.
Not always but...

What? I'm a bitch?

Is that it?
No, you're awesome.

That's right.

Truth said sometimes you
freak out for no reason.

Like you haven't had sex for
a long time or something.

What? I have plenty of sex, thank you.

You're the one that's always jerking off.

What?

You don't think I heard you last
night in a motel room?

I did not jerk off at the
motel last night, I'm sorry.

I couldn't do that with you in a room.
Are you crazy?

You were making funny noises.
I was not.

Were you thinking about me?
God.

God doesn't exist.

I know.

Am I like haughty sort of type?
No, sometimes, that's all.

No, you're right.

I mean I'm very direct and honest
and people don't like that.

They prefer if you just
smile and say pretty things...

About them especially... Nobody
wants to hear the truth.

The truth is not cool.

Unlike... Madonna?

Yeah, she's cool.

But she's getting old. I think
it's good for image though.

Makes you forget she's a whore.

It's like impossible to take
a good picture of you.

Wow, I had a good time in there.
Your shower is like great.

So... who's this?

That's Marriona, the girl I met in Brazil.

I told you about her, remember?

Oh, that's her?

She's like 12.
She's a bit older than that.

Can I keep it?
Why?

It's a pretty picture with
ocean and everything.

Right.

No, really, I mean it. It's very peaceful.

And your friend looks so happy and
relaxed in that tiny, tiny bikini.

She's a really nice girl. You'd like her.

Oh my God! Is this it?
No.

Yes it is, it's got your name on it.

Yeah, I'll send you a copy for
Christmas, how's that?

Why can't I just read this one?
Because.

Come on, it's been driving me
crazy I can't find it anywhere.

So it will make a really
nice Christmas present.

Fine. But don't forget, OK?

And you have to send a nice card with it.

Something really funny

a bunch of reindeers in
swimming pool wearing sunglasses.

Or a snowman in microwave... freaking out.

You're going to be disappointed. I'm
telling you it's really boring.

I don't care.

'Entropy and the second
law of thermodynamics'?

What did you expect?

Something about little Fluffy
animals with no arms, like you said.

Sorry.

I wrote it in college. It had to be boring.

Are you going to be a
scientist or something?

Not really. At some point I wanted to
be a vet... I really like dogs.

But then I realised that you've
got to take care of all the animals,

not just dogs but turtles,
pelicans, ferrets...

It's kind of like being a lawyer.

You don't really get to
choose your clients.

Right... I don't trust those things.
They can't even see straight.

Lawyers?
No, ferrets.

Do you want a drink?
Sure.

What do you want?
Anything. What are you having?

Cranberry juice.
That stuff is disgusting.

Well, how about milk and cookies?

I tell you what - put a shot of
vodka and that cranberry stuff of yours

and you've got yourself a deal.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Hello, my name is Robbie robot.

Stop touching my stuff.

It's fun. You have so many weird things.

Yeah...

So how's the life in Tokyo?

It's OK.

Boring?

Yes and no.

Maybe it's me.

You know, work on that.

I know.

So, those cookies you mentioned...
Are they for real?

Yeah, you want one, they're real good.
Made them myself.

I can only have one?

Didn't you put the
sunscreen on this morning?

Yeah but this is different. It's
a moisturizer without hydroxen.

It makes my skin
regenerate four times faster

and it improves elasticity.
Makes me look pretty.

Good, you're so Metro.
What?

You're metrosexual. Admit it.

What is that?

Are you kidding me?
No, is it like a big deal?

Oh my God, what planet are you from?

Don't you watch TV, read newspapers,
magazines... it's everywhere.

They did an episode about it on
'South park'. It was hilarious.

I don't watch TV.

How can you live like that?

You're missing out on all the good stuff.

No, I'm not.

So what am I anyway?
Metrosexual.

You're basically gay but you like women.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

It's becoming quite popular in big cities.

I'm in touch with my feminine
side and I take care of myself.

What's wrong with that?
Nothing. It's great.

You're a renaissance man.

You're conscientious about
your image and body,

you dress well,

you're very docile and
gentle like a little puppy...

And you're very secure with your sexuality.

You can say that again, sister.
I'm serious. Girls like that, you know.

Metrosexual man do what they want,
they don't care if their behaviour

goes against the traditional
image of masculinity.

Confidence is so sexy.
You're so right.

I eat organic food, I drink herbal
tea, I got all sorts of vitamins...

You're in touch with your feelings...

I know nothing about sports... Pretty cool.

Personally - I think it's kind
of gay but that's just me.

I like big biceps,
testosterone and red meat.

No, you don't.
No really, that's me.

You're funny.
What?

Nothing.

OK, Johnny deep, go over there.

Johnny deep - he's Metro, right?
Oh yeah, baby. He's Metro. Yummy.

I guess it's pretty good
time to be a woman, huh?

Yeah, it's not bad.

No picking, pervert!

OK, you can turn around now.

You definitely have a Metro butt.

Let's go.

I'm feeling really sexy right now.

You should.

That's what I'm saying. I feel great.

Do you know how you were born, Wes?
How your life began?

I have a pretty good idea, yeah.
No you don't.

You came to this world billions
of years ago, my friend.

In a galaxy far, faraway.

Couple of planets collided,
Adams through here and there

and you Wesley Jack Montgomery began to
exist in a very loose sort of way.

Loose?

Mhm. See, for a while you
were just floating around.

Traveling, if you wish.
Interstellar winds, comets...

You were all over the place, man.

You're a very strange person.

All I'm saying is your
days here are numbered.

You've got other places to go.

Yeah.

Can we just keep dancing?

Of course.

You can do anything you want.

I really want to go dancing, Wes.

It's late.

Sometimes they play music from
the eighties, come on.

You might even have a good time.

The eighties.

How can you not like eighties music?

It's like super-positive and
full of energy, like woohoo!

Come on, it will be super-fun.
I don't know.

Yeah. You need to see a
little Montreal nightlife.

Come on, please... Please, please, please.

Look, he's driving.

It's not a trick, he's really driving.

Am I supposed to laugh?
Yeah.

It's not funny.
Come on!

OK, look, he can also shift gears.

Ready... go!

Wes!

OK, stop screwing around.

It's really dangerous.

It is so not even funny.

You're lying.
No, I'm not. It's time to grow up.

You grow up.

Oh boy, you must've been such a
little prat when you were a kid.

I bet your mum had a nice liqueur cabinet.

I was an adorable little
person when I was a kid.

I can totally see you walking around at
school with your fingers up your nose.

Making faces... thinking you're the
king of things that are kind of funny

except they're not. Did
your little friends laugh?

Yeah, Abby... she had really thick
glasses and was kind of shy.

Kids are evil. I was pretty shy too.
Especially at high-school.

I could never talk to boys, I
was always too intimidated.

They were so big.
Yeah, I was kind of small.

Wes, stop it! I'm serious,
it's really dangerous.

Take it easy, mama bear.

What if a big gasoline truck drives
by and your little friend gets nervous?

Then what?

Boom! Barbecue time!

Is that bacon cooking? Oh no!
It's your face!

You're hurting his feelings.
What did he ever do to you?

Aw!

What are you doing?
Relax!

You relax. Keep your eyes on the road.

It will only take a second.

It's totally safe, trust me.

Wes, I am not kidding. You stay right here.

Can you imagine living out here?
Like... what do you do?

Just live, I guess.

Do you think they're happy?

People who live here?
Yeah.

I don't know. In what way?

Do you think they feel
warm and bubbly inside

when they wake up in the morning?

And how about when they die...

I mean just before they do, when
they take their last breath...

Do you think they're happy then?

At peace with everything they've done?

Do you ever exercise? You know like...
do yoga or anything.

Yoga? What do you know about yoga?

I read about it.
'Read' doesn't count.

Yeah, it does, books are great.

Well, maybe you should write one?

Like a collection of
little jokes or something.

I did... I wrote a book seven years ago.
Serious one.

Get out!

You have to stop the car first otherwise
it would be very dangerous.

And we wouldn't want that.
Wes... you're not funny.

Stop trying to make it happen...
it's not happening.

It's so happening, Alison,
in like different dimension.

You should join us, it's a lot of fun.

Why do you always say 'Alison' when
you talk to me? I know I'm Alison.

You just said 'Alison' when when you
talked to me like 30 seconds ago.

Yeah, but I almost never do it.

You, on the other hand,
seem to be on a mission

to make sure I never forget my name.
I'm Alison, I know, thanks.

You're welcome.

What was your book about?
I'm not telling you.

Oh, come on, tell me.
No.

Can I read it?
No.

You suck.
Thank you.

Come on, what is it about?

Penguins.
Penguins?

Yeah. In a world of penguins it's a
big book, I sold a lot of copies.

I'm like expert when it comes to penguins.

Really?
Yeah.

I don't believe you.

Come on, penguins?
Yeah.

You're lying.

No more.

I'm so hungry.

What do you want to eat?

Don't you ever sleep?
Not really.

How about pasta? It sounds great!
With cheese.

What's your favourite kind of cheese?

Did you have fun?

Yes, I did.

Me too.

Hey, sweetie.

Hello, cat.

How old are you?

Payaso. He's four years old.

Payaso?
Yeah, isn't that a cool name?

When Kai gave it to me
it was like this big.

Tiny, tiny.

It was my birthday gift. I
cried for five minutes.

Payaso, I like it.

Kai said it meant 'hope' when
he gave it to me.

In Japanese, you know.

He was making a joke.

Doesn't really mean anything in Japanese.

His English is kind of funny.

It means 'clown' in Spanish, right?
Yeah.

Still a cute name for a cat.
You're so cute.

I'm really hungry.

How about cucumber sandwiches with jelly?

My favourite, no thanks.

Fine, I'm going to make
one just for myself.

And once I start eating, you'll
be like 'oh, can I have a bite?'

and I'll be like 'no' and you're
going to be like 'oh, come on'

and you're going to eat the whole sandwich.

That's kind of rude.

Hello? What about chocolate?

What about you? Do you want some chocolate?

Are you ready?

Oh yeah, it's now or never, baby.

Just remember - don't open
your eyes during transport.

Why not?
Because you'll die.

Got it.

See that circle over there?
Yeah.

What you're going to do

is you're going to close your
eyes and concentrate real hard.

Then you're going to let everything go.
And I do mean everything.

That is the key right there. And
don't worry about the 'champ'.

'Champ'?
Yeah, it's going to go 'champ'.

Are you sure this is safe?
Just don't open your eyes.

And don't look at the dog. We
don't want to freak him out.

Sure, let's take good care of the dog.
We like the dog. The dog is important.

He's the center of attention. He's special.

Look, you're starting to upset the dog.
Hurry up.

I've upset the dog. Great.

Wow! Did you see that? I can fly!

That is technically incorrect.

You can travel through space at
ridiculously fast speed.

Subatomic level. Which is
not bad, not bad at all.

But it's not flying. Not exactly.

Come, I can fly. Say it.

For all intents and purposes,

yes... you have achieved paranormal
transportation.

Woohoo!

So what is exactly the
second law of thermodynamics?

You don't want to know.
Tell me!

It's really about the transfer of energy.

Like when air escapes the punctured
tire because the pressure outside the tire

is a lot lower than the
pressure inside the tire.

That kind of stuff.

Energy's changing from being
localized to being more spread out.

It's really cool.
Yeah, it's fascinating.

I told you it was boring.
No, it's kind of cool. Really.

Just shut up.

Do you like this color?
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

Don't make fun of me.

I like it, really. It brings out your eyes.

You're making fun of me.
It's really beautiful.

If I were to paint my toe
nails and I had your eyes,

that's the color I'd choose.
No doubt about it.

You don't have any cigarettes, do you?
No.

It's so crazy but I would totally sell
my soul for a cigarette right now.

Just one, you know.

I thought you stopped smoking.
I did, that's why I want them.

Sometimes I wonder how you ever
made it past kindergarten, Wes.

Maybe you should think about... melons.

Melons?
Yeah, watermelons.

I keep forgetting how weird you are.
I think watermelons could help you.

I mean, why would you want to smoke,

when you can be thinking about watermelons?

They're the perfect distraction.

They're colorful, they're filled with
water and other natural stuff...

They're good for you, you know.

It makes no sense at all.
It's a freaking fruit.

I want a cigarette.
I was only trying to help you.

Never mind, have your freaking cigarette.

I don't smoke any more.

So why are you thinking about cigarettes?

Because I don't smoke any more.

I'm not weird.
Right.

I'm good at this.

Yeah, let's not discuss why.

It's kind of fun. I bet
that's why you guys do it.

Oh, yeah. My sisters and I,

we get together like all the time and
we have hours of fun with this stuff.

Hours! And then we get naked and make out.

I'm glad you quit smoking.
It's very mature of you.

Watermelons. It's the dumbest thing I've
ever heard. You should get a medal.

I should get a medal.

You're doing a pretty good job.
I know.

I'm taking this one.

You do that every night.
Yes I do.

Sleep is such a fantastic thing.
It's one of life's little treasures.

Chocolate chip cookie are pretty cool too.

Long day...
It was fun.

Yeah... I really like driving.
I never get tired of it.

It's very zen... like shaving your legs.

I know exactly what you mean.

Aren't there a lot of Mormons in Utah?
I think so, I'm not sure.

Have we seen any?
I don't know. What do they look like?

Like farmers from the 50's.
Something like that.

I think we've seen a few, I
wasn't paying attention.

We are going to sleep like babies.

Where's the remote?

There's like nothing on TV.
So turn it off.

Sexy.
I know.

Total soy complex. Oat proteins?

You're so annoying.
No, I'm not.

Yes, you are. You're like a little girl.

That's right.

Skin silkening soy extract.

You get bored so easily, Alison.

That's kind of fun.
It is not fun.

Yes it is. It's interesting.

You always have to be doing
something or talking about something.

What do you mean?

I don't know, you really
like to talk, like a lot.

It's not that bad.

You talk to payaso?
Sometimes.

Does he listen?
She listens, she's a girl.

But sometimes she just
hides under the sofa.

Maybe she's running away from you?
No, she's not. She loves me.

Do you want to get drunk? Goes
really well with being bored.

Like going to the car wash or
playing strip-poker.

I'm not bored.

But if you want to get drunk,
I'll definitely join you.

Sounds like a lot of fun.

Don't forget the eyelids. It's
where I need it the most.

It's like super important.

Happy?
Yes, thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey, it's me. It's like midnight.

Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

We stopped by this canyon,
it was really quiet.

Yeah? Did you have fun?

Yeah, what else did you do?

That's great.

Yeah? Oh, I don't know.

You worked really hard.
I think you'll get it.

Yeah, don't worry.

Oh, guess what? We might
stop in Las Vegas tomorrow.

How cool would that be, huh?

Yeah, I know.

Yeah, OK. Goodnight.

Me too. I love you.

OK. Bye.

(Speaking Japanese)

It was so quiet that
afternoon by the canyon.

I could have stayed there forever.

I kind of did.

You're so interesting, Wes. It's
like time doesn't matter to you.

Are you kidding me? Things go by so fast.
I don't get it.

Yeah, but it doesn't freak you out.
You're so patient, so calm.

There are plenty of moments where I
want just kick things and scream.

Trust me.
I don't know...

I mean sometimes you're really quiet and
you get this look on your face like...

Time doesn't exist.

That's how you make me feel.

Like I've all the time in the
world because time doesn't exist.

It's nice.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

I think I want to have a baby.

With me?
No.

With Kai?

I don't like change.
It's very disorienting.

I mean when something changes in
your life, you have to adapt.

Which means you have to change.

And what if I like the way I
am and I don't want to change?

Then don't. You don't have to.

Sometimes I can't even
tell if I'm moving forward

or if I'm like frozen.

It makes me feel like I'm
not in control of my life.

It's not that bad. Being vulnerable.

You should care about things, about people.

There's nothing wrong with that.
It's kind of scary, don't you think?

Doesn't have to be.

And being scared doesn't
mean you're in bad situation.

It just means new things are
coming your way.

Depends on how you see the future I guess.

What do you mean?

Do you see it as this thing
far, far away, full of ideals

and wonderful, impossible things?

Or do you see it as the next hour?
The next morning?

Does it really matter?
I think so.

One definitely feels better than the other.

I think that's what matters.

Do you think these moments will
stay with us for a long time?

You think we'll still be talking like
this in 5 years? In 10? In 20?

I hope so.

I don't want to lose what we have.

I'm sorry I can't offer you more.

In a night I dreamt I was lying in
the middle of busy road...

â€¦ And I was suffocating.

Dying like a fish off the water.

Ouch.

Nobody would help me, I mean people would
just walk by and not see me,

like I didn't exist.

What do you think it means?

What do you think it means?
I don't know.

And the funny thing is in
the middle of the dream

this red car shows up.

And these two ladies come
out and offer to help me.

Only now I'm the one who can't see them.

I thought if it's the
world that I'm dreaming,

I could see what's going on.

I mean I could see them... the two girls...

So I start yelling at the other me.
The one who's dying.

I'm like: 'Hey, idiot!
Check out two lesbians.

They want to help you. Hey! Hello!

Check out two lesbians in the Camaro, man!
They want to help'.

How weird is that, huh?

You were dying, huh?
Yeah, suffocating.

I can't believe you can buy
watermelon sat this hour.

It's L.A. You can buy a
Ferrari at this hour.

No you can't.What are you talking about?

It's an expression.
An expression?

What do you know anyway?

Have you ever tried to buy a
Ferrari in Los Angeles at 3 A.M.?

No. Maybe we should try?
Yeah, that would be funny.

We would show up with watermelon and
like 'hey, do you take visa?'.

Nice pajamas.
Thanks.

It's very feng-shui of
her, don't you think?

Spices up the whole place, brings
up the positive energy, you know.

I bet you're going to have a great night.

No armed robberies, that's for sure.

It's pretty, I like it.

50 dollars.

Really?

Yes.
For a watermelon?

Seedless watermelon.

Are you sure you don't have any
cigarettes hidden somewhere?

I'm absolutely 100% certain
of that, yes. Sorry.

It's OK. It's only an addiction.
You can beat that.

You should probably get
a few hours of sleep

before you go to the airport, huh?

Yeah.

You can take my bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

I'm glad I called.

Yeah, I wish you didn't have to leave.

Me too.

In another life maybe.

Yeah, maybe.

You know I don't mind if you want to stay.

We can share the bed.

If you promise you won't get
weird after I fall asleep.

Don't try to lick my feet or something.

Yeah?
Yeah. Come on.

If you could be a fish... any fish...
What would it be?

Ssh... Wes, you talk too much.

I do?
When you're nervous, yeah.

A dolphin.

What?

I'd want to be a dolphin.

Dolphins are mammals. I asked for a fish.

Well, I'd still want to be a dolphin.

Good choice.

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

All right. We play now.

We play now!

Suicide kings and one-eyed Jacks.

That's a little wild.

How many cards is that?
5.

Really?
That's enough.

All right there, Sonny,
what are you going to bet?

Ma'am, I'll bet you one
pair of denim jeans.

Excellent choice. And I will
bet one black negligee.

Woooohoo!

Lay them down.

Pair of sixes. Read them and weep.

You can't beat it. You can't beat it.

Pair of aces.

Take them off.

I'm stuck.
You need some help.

I'm stuck.

I win.

This is so much fun.

It's like my favourite game.

Do you want to dance?'Cause I
feel like Ricky Martin's Cd.

You're so weird.
Yes, I am.

Good for you.
Yeah, good for me.

Hey!

I'll catch you later.

I'm going to catch up with you guys later.
I'll talk to Chad.

He's hilarious.
I know. He's great, right?

He's so weird. But good weird.

See you later.

Misha?

Hello?

Are you dead?

Misha, it's time to go home.

(Speaking French)

I think he'll be fine.

Come on, sweetie.

I love it. I'm so drunk.

Me too.

You looked really pretty tonight.

I don't know if it's the
martinis talking or what but...

You were really hot.

I was like... Mhmm... all night.

Pig.
Bite me.

You wish.

You're funny.
I know.

Goodnight, Johnny deep.

Goodnight.

Sleep is such a funny thing. Our
body is like so sophisticated.

Machine complex beyond our
wildest imagination.

It feels, it loves, suffers,
it can even replicate itself.

But it only works half of the time.

Do you think whoever'll build
a machine like that one day?

Something really cool that
only works half the time?

Yes, one day when we understand.

Why is it that when you're a kid

you always wake up super
early in the morning?

And then you grow up and
it's hard to wake up.

And then when you're really old you
go back to waking up early.

I don't know.

That's something you're going have
to find out on your own.

But I like your thinking.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

Hi. I'm Alison.

Wes. Nice to meet you.

What are you doing out here?

I'm dreaming.

Really?

Everything feels so real.

I know.

Wes?

This is a bad idea. I shouldn't be here.

I'm going to go back on my own.

You don't have to.
I know. I want to.

Why?

I don't know.

I shouldn't have come in a first place.

Don't say that.

Yeah.

Good morning.
Good morning.

What?

What?

The airport is closed.

It's beautiful.
Yeah, it is.

Alright, thank you.

They don't really know. I have
to call back later today.

If they've done an
underground supersonic train,

you know like super-fast train

that can go anywhere in
the world super-fast...

You could take that to go home. It
would be super-comfortable too.

See, Wes, you're always so calm.

I like snow.

I had this dream last night.
It was really beautiful.

Yeah?

I was living on this
planet where all you could do

is eat chocolate and make love.
It was pretty cool.

Why was it so beautiful?

The sun was blue... like really blue.
Not orange.

The sky was orange but the sun was
blue and the night was pink

bright pink. And the stars were green.

And people were happy. And there
were lots of bunnies. Tons.

I don't ever want to hear
you saying weird again.

How come you have no
pictures of me on the walls?

I took them off.
You should put them back.

I will.
Promise me.

I promise.

Wait, don't move.

Say 'happy cows make happy cheese'.

It's really good. You look
all cute and everything.
