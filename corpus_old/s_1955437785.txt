RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): I want
to be a light, but it feels so dark.

It's like...

I have a heavy heart
and this burden on my back.

There's something in me
that makes me want to cry...

...and I don't even know what it is.


(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

NEWSMAN: America and the world mourns,

as the biggest school shooting
in U.S. history

took place today at Columbine High School.

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
According to reports,

two gunmen came in shooting, and began
working their way through the school.

What police and everyone else
are looking for now is a reason

for the violence
that tore this quiet school

and suburban neighborhood apart
just weeks before graduation.

(SIREN BLARING)

(MUFFLED, ECHOING BOOM FADES TO SILENCE)

(ZIPPER CLOSES)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Rach, it's okay.

Just try and get some sleep.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

(ENGINE STARTS)

Are they getting a divorce?

Mom? Can you pay for my car insurance?

You said you would.
Um...

Yeah, I don't know yet.

It's really expensive, Bethanie.

Unbelievable. This is so lame.

Oh, you know what? I picked up
some extra houses to clean,

so I'm gonna need your help
with the kids tomorrow.

I'm not their mother.

(CHILD SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

MOTHER (VOICE-OVER): Okay, guys, now
that your dad doesn't live here anymore,

we're not going to have
as much as we used to.

So each morning, we're going
to pray for what we need. Okay?

Okay.

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

Dear Jesus, thank you
for these precious children. (SIGHS)

You tell us to come to you
for the things that we need.

So, Lord, I pray for gas money
to get to work.

GIRL: I pray for cute clothes for school.

And car insurance for Bethanie.

And lots of stuffed animals.

Amen.

(KIDS LAUGHING)

(GIRLS LAUGHING NEARBY)

GIRL (LAUGHS): Congratulations!

I saw you got the lead!
BOY: Thank you! I did!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
BOY 2: Congrats!

Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
I'm excited, honestly.

It only took me three years, so...
GIRL: Yeah.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
This just proves that no one notices me.

Everybody treats me like I'm 14.

So you didn't get the lead
in the school play.

Who cares? You're just a sophomore.

Uh, Alex was a sophomore when
he got his first lead role.

It's true.
I know. He doesn't even know my name.

And Mrs. Diaz said she's gonna
let him write the play next year.

Well... I know Alex a little.

I mean, he was the only boy in
my dance class when we were kids.

He's pretty hot. Mm-hmm.

For a drama guy.
Not exactly my type.

We both love acting.

He would be perfect for me.

I could see that.

I just want a real boyfriend.

You know, guys never think of me that way.

Well, let's change that.

I'll get him to notice you.

But first, you have
to stop wearing these hats

that you've been wearing
since the fourth grade.

Look at me.
Thank you.

He probably wouldn't like me anyway, so...

Don't say that.

Now, just let me work my magic,

and I'll see if I can arrange
for something this weekend.

You're the best, Maddy.

Don't call me that.
Ooh...!

Stop it! I hate it! God!

Now, I'm gonna do the best that I can do,

but I need you to make sure that he
doesn't just see you as a friend,

if you know what I mean.
Got it.


Totally.

Don't ever do that in front of him.
I was kidding.

Ever. (LAUGHING)
That was bad.

GIRL (OUTSIDE): Come on,
the guys are already there.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER OUTSIDE)

GIRL 2: Unless your mom has
a crystal ball, no one's gonna find out.

Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.
(LAUGHTER)

We've got liquid courage.
(WHISPERS): Rachel!

Come on.

DANA: Rachel.

I can hear them from my room.

You know Mom's gonna bust you.

Well, don't say anything.

I'm not gonna lie for you again.

Come on, Dana.

Don't be such a goody-goody.


This night could be huge for me.


Thanks. I owe you one. Seriously.

Rachel!
It's gonna be kind of weird

hanging out with drama guys.

# In the aftermath #

# My music in my... #

(IMITATES BIRD): Ca-caw! Ca-caw!


Well, that's what he asked me to do.

I think it's kind of cool.

Thank you.

BOY: Welcome, ladies.

The pool is open exclusively

for our personal guests.
Don't get too nutty,

'cause we're not technically
supposed to be here.

Well, this is Celine,
and this is Gabby, and Rachel.

Alex, you two
should get to know each other.

Have we met before?

I think she tried out for the play.

Villager number four.
That's it, yeah.

ALEX: Well, come on in.
The water's warm, and...

we have drinks.
So do we.


# La, la, la, la-la... #

(LAUGHTER NEARBY)

I think I'm gonna go check on Gabby
before she pukes in the pool.

We'll miss you.
But, hey, you should show Rachel

your ballet moves from the fourth grade.

ALEX: You know, that's tempting.

I just might.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

I'm not like my friends.

What do you mean?


And they are?

No.

No, I didn't mean it like that.

We've been best friends
since elementary school.

It's just...

I mean, look at them.

All the guys want them.

But I want the guy I want
to want what I am and...

not the fake version of what I think

I want to think that they want
to think that I am.

Interesting.

I'm not a social plastic person.

Just wanted to get that out there.

(ALEX SIGHS)

ALEX: That's cool. What is it?

I don't know, really.

Sometimes I just draw what I feel.

You're an artist?

I'm all right.

I actually write more than I draw.

Oh, I act what I write.

You know, people like us,
we have stories to tell.

You know, and acting, it...

really brings those words to life
so people can really feel it, you know?

Yeah.

That's why all the world's a stage...

And all the men and women merely players.

They have their exits and their entrances.


Yeah. Course.


I want to write plays, too.

Well, I can help you out,
you know, show you what I know.

My process.
That'd be cool.

I can take a look at your
writing, too, if you want.

I connect through writing.

Words are the window to the heart.

Yeah.

You're, like. deep. (CHUCKLES)

Are you spiritual or something?

No.

Not... no, not really.

Really? 'Cause, you know...

I'm a spiritual guy myself.

You know, I like to take in the energy
around me for my art.

Yeah. Guess I'm like that, too.

Mm.

Hey, you guys are too dry! Come in!

No, we're good.

(GROANING, JEERING)
Come on! Come on!

Well... if that's what you want.

You know, I want what you want.

But just in case you wanted to know,

I want you to want
to come in the pool. Just...

wanted to get that out there.

# Here I am #

# Just waiting, and the world #

# Is passing by #
(CHEERING, WHOOPING)

MADISON: Girl, come here!

# All alone in my sanctuary #

Oh!
Careful.

MOTHER: Rachel Joy.
(GASPS)

I prayed over pillows tonight.
Where have you been?

Out with the girls.

Why is your hair all wet?

We went swimming.

What if something had happened?

I need to know where my children are.

Sorry, Mom.

You smell like smoke.

And... booze.

Are you buzzing?

Mom, nobody says that.

Oh. Okay, well, you're grounded
till you go to your Aunt Bea's.

What? Mom, that's, like, the whole summer!

Exactly. This kind of behavior
will not be tolerated

under this roof.
DANA: I told you.

(CHUCKLES)
Shut up, Dana.

Rachel, we're gonna have a long
chat about this in the morning.

You're better than this, Rachel Joy.

MOTHER (VOICE-OVER):
I can't even control them.

Larry went from no kids
to five kids overnight.

He's still getting used to everything.

that he's gonna regret it.

Beth, don't say that.
I think it'll be good

for Rachel to get away
from her friends for a bit.

I'll be. Sometimes I don't know
what I'm gonna do with that girl.

Being at the farm with her cousins
is gonna be good for her.

(COW MOOING, HORSE NEIGHING)

(HORSE HUFFS)

(COWS MOOING)

(ROOSTER CROWING)

We have been looking all over for you.

Here I am.

Rach...

you're kind of different this summer.

I just wanted to be alone.


(HORSE WHINNIES)

Rachel...

what's really going on?

I just want to help.

Well, you can't.

You would never understand.
Your family's perfect.


I'm sorry.

It wasn't supposed to be like that.


It's not like I'm trying
to do the wrong thing.

I just can't help it.

I used to try so hard
to get it all together,

but... none of that worked.

I had to let God in.


I've done the whole church thing.

I know about Jesus.

I know it sounds crazy,
and it's really hard

to explain, but... it's about
truly living a life for Jesus.

And when you do that, you'll
have this sense of peace.

I don't know.

That's just what worked for me.

BEA (VOICE-OVER): Rachel, life can
be really hard, but listen to me,

God does not waste anything,
not even the bad things.

# And everybody's got
a wound to be healed #

# I want to believe #

# There's beauty here #

# How many times
have you heard me cry out #

# "God, please take this"? #

# How many times
have you given me strength #

# To just keep breathing? #

RACHEL: Lord, I'm sorry
for everything that I've done.

Jesus, I ask, forgive me,

and I ask you to come into my life.

Father, use me to be a light to the world.

# Oh, I need you #

# God, I need you now #

(HAPPY SQUEALS)

# I need you now #

# I need you now. #

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Rach, why do you always draw
the same flower?

Why, are you mad
I haven't drawn it for you yet?

I actually am, thank you.
(LAUGHS)

Rachel, I know you've been thinking about
a lot of things, and sometimes it helps

to just write down your thoughts,
so I wanted to give you this.

Thanks, Aunt Bea.

You're welcome.
Love it.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
God, I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

You know what you're doing,
and you know what's best for me.

From now on,

I put all of my faith
and all of my trust in you.

Hey, Austin.

Oh. Uh, hey, Rachel.

What a retard.
(LAUGHS): Right.

Rachel's got a new... ba-ba-ba-boyfriend.

Not exactly, Sean.

Ooh...
Are you jealous, Dylan?

DYLAN: No.
(BOYS WHOOPING)

First day of school sucks.

Hey.

At least the guys have a tan.
Mm.

Hey, look at these fly girls!

Brian Riggs!
What's up?

Hey! How's football going?
Hey.

We're gonna rock this year.
Well, we'll finally

have something to cheer for, then.

Ha-ha-ha.
(GIRLS LAUGH)

Oh, uh, dude, Shep's parents are gone
all semester, so we're gonna have

mad ragers, like, every weekend.

You guys got to come.

Oh, we'll be there.
Let us know when.

Yeah, most def.

Hey, uh, this is K.J.

Uh, he just came from California.

Plays linebacker. K.J.,
this is Gabby and Madison.

Hey.
What's up?

Welcome to Columbine.
Good to meet you.

Let's bounce.

MADISON: See you around.

See what I mean? Guys don't even see me.

Hey, we're working on it.

Have you talked to Alex yet?

No. But I have drama class
with him sixth period.

Good. This is the time to strike.

You've got to stay on his radar.
Totally.

Okay. But I'm not going to be fake.

Girl, you couldn't be fake
if you tried. (LAUGHS)


Dude, you sound like a hyena.

He looks like a hyena.
Yeah, seriously, you sound like an idiot.

(GRUNTS)
Let's go! Come on! Get him!

Yo! It's time for dork bowling!

(CHEERING, WHOOPING)

Come on!

(WHOOPING, LAUGHTER)


OTHERS: Oh!

Strike!


I'll kill you, Riggs.

Oh, I'm so scared.
OTHERS: Ooh...

Don't look at me.

BRIAN: You got something on your back, yo!

Dude, every time, every time.

I hate those guys.

Just another day at Columbine.

Why does it always have
to be so cliquey here?

I thought it was gonna be
different this year.

One of Hitler's central themes in his writing
is that it was a Nazi's responsibility

to aid evolution by exterminating
less evolved people groups.

In his opinion, that was those
who had different-colored skin,

were religious or were handicapped.

Hitler thought natural selection
should be actively aided.

Come on, dude.

You're never gonna change
what's happening in there.

That's just the way the world is.

Well, I want to change the world.

Okay. Good luck. What's your plan?

Don't know yet.

Do you ever feel like
you can't see your future?

You know, feel like...

like it might be your last year?

No.


It's not, though.

It's more like...

something big's gonna happen.

Like a chain reaction.

Not sure what that means,
but I'm here for you.

I never made it to class.

Of course you didn't.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

KEVIN: Alex Dickerson?

Really?
Maybe.

If I work the radar.

Am I gonna lose you
as my prom date already?

I thought that was only
if we couldn't find anyone.

Yeah, well, neither of us have
in three years.

You'll find someone.

WOMAN: Welcome to Advanced Drama.

In this class, you will get
the privilege of creating,

producing and performing the spring play.

Mr. Alex Dickerson here
will be our playwright.

I've got something for you. Hold on.

You know when you meet someone,
and in, like,

the first few minutes
they're, like, a soul mate?

KEVIN: No.

RACHEL: Alex is like that.

He gets me.

It's like he was made for me.

Miss Scott, is there something
that you'd like to share

with all of us?
No, not really.

Very nice, Miss Scott.



Uh, theater is one of the six classic
art forms, so I'd argue that...

this is art class.

Brownnoser.

Well, I stand corrected, Mr. Dickerson.

Okay, all of you underclassmen will be
paired with a senior mentor. And...

these papers I just handed you
are your pairings.

I know.

(MADISON SQUEALS)

Okay, so, is he still, like, your mentor

or whatever you call it?
Yes!

Hey, spazzes. One of you
had better won the lottery.

Alex and Rachel are going to be doing

drama geek stuff together.
Oh, this is so perfect.

Okay, he told me that he's gonna be at Shep's
party tomorrow, we have to be there.

Okay.

Okay! Party!
Whoo!

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Um, can you go get us
some drinks or something?


Who is that?
I can't remember his name,

and I feel like it would be
way too awkward to ask now.

Celine...

you have to be careful. Like, what...
I'm fine.

What if he...
Seriously, I'm fine.

Okay.

Now go do whatever it is you do.

That whole non-fake thing.

You can do this.
Okay.

Hey, mentor.

Hey.

Did you have something to do
with us getting paired up?

Must have been the theater gods.

They might have known that I
missed seeing you this summer.

Yeah, I... got grounded
for most of it, so...

You know, there's a lot
going on behind those eyes.

You should try out
for the female lead in my play.

I'd need a good mentor to help
me prepare for the audition.

You're out of luck there.

GIRL: Alex?
(LAUGHS)

Hey! How are you?
Hi. Good. How are you?

I'm great.

I heard you're writing a play?
Yeah.

I'll see you in class.

Yeah.

See you Monday.

ALEX: How are you?
I'm doing well. How are you?

I'm great.
So, like, what was your inspiration?

(BIRDS SINGING)

Hey, Larry.
Hey, Rachel.

You know, that old Acura's
getting pretty lonely.

I don't want to talk right now.

You sure? You should think
about letting me use it.

I just got home from work... I don't
want to have to think about anything.

Hey, honey.
LARRY: Hi, honey.

Are you tired from...

filing debit and credit reports?

And punching the calculator?

I am, actually.
(MOCK MOAN): Oh. Exhausted.

Mom, when's Dad coming to get us?
I don't know.

Uh, he was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

Son, do you have to play
that thing right here?


I am not your son.

You know, and there's
a logical reason to this,

if you let me drive the car, I could
drive myself to work, and Mom

wouldn't have to.
Beth...

Right?
(QUIETLY): make her stop.

Rachel, he's not used to all this.

You're gonna have to give him
some time to decompress.

Why don't you help me with dinner?

Queens hate to cook, Mom.
Come on, Larry, please?

The car needs a new catalytic converter,
and foreign parts are expensive.

You could even teach me
how to drive my car.

No, it's my car, and I said no.

He said no, Rachel.

For now.

Come on, Larry.

I need my chariot.

Not gonna happen.
Fine.

But I at least need a smile
before I let go.

(CRAIG CONTINUES PLAYING GUITAR)

Mm-hmm. Come on.

More than that.

Get those pearly whites
out there. (LAUGHS)

My work here is done.

Thank you.
(BETH CLAPPING)

(PHONE RINGING)
Oh.

BETH: Yeah?

Okay.

Bye.

Your dad has to work, so he
can't have you this weekend.

But he wants you to know

that he loves you and he misses you...
(CRAIG SIGHS)

He will talk to you soon.

Thank you.

If the lady doesn't get
anything, she can't stay.

I don't want crazy people in here.

Can you go ask her to leave?

You want me to?

I'm busy.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

WOMAN: Excuse me.

Uh, my friend here would like a...

A coffee.

A French press.

And... a bagel.

With cream cheese.

Perfect.

Thank you very much.

Okay.

May I?

(SOFTLY): Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

So, where are you from?

She paid.

That would be wonderful. It's not far.
Oh, good.

"Not far" is on my way.

I couldn't impose.
Oh, no, you're not.

It's not a problem.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): I don't understand
why having a walk with God is so hard for me.

I'm so weak.

At school, with friends, at work.

Today it was like I let a wonderful flame

pass by me and into the hands of another.

Those gloves have become
the gloves of conviction to me.

I'm not going to miss another opportunity.

From now on, when I have
those little nudges inside,

I'm going to listen.

MAN (VOICE-OVER):
Remember, living for Jesus

is not always easy, but it's always right.

Hey, thanks for coming to Break Thru.

See you here next week,
same time, same place.

Don't forget, we have pizza in the back.

Yeah!
Pizza! Sweet!

RACHEL: You're the best, Amy.

See you at cell group on Wednesday?

Yeah, absolutely.
Okay. Bye.

Bye.

Have you seen him before?

No. But he's not exactly the type
you'd want to take home to Mom, so...

Let's go.
I'll be right back.

Okay. Hurry. I want to go.

Hi.


I'm Rachel.

Uh...

Hey.

Uh, see you.

Um... I just wanted to
welcome you to Break Thru.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)

(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)

(TRAIN WHEELS CLACKING IN DISTANCE)

Hey.

You never told me your name.

What are you doing here?

Kind of rude for you
to just walk off like that.

(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)

I don't... really like church.

Why'd you come?

For the food.

Look, you should probably
go get in your daddy's car

and go home.
I don't have my own car.

Or my own dad at home.

I walked.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)

Fine. I'll walk you back, then.

This really isn't a place
for a girl like you.

What does that mean?
It means

you don't really fit in around here.

I don't care. Hey...

Can I help you?

No. Okay? I don't...

I don't need some dumb little
sister I got to look out for.

I've never had a big brother before.


Come on, you must need something.

You're not just gonna get rid of me.

I'm not leaving until you
tell me something you need.

Shh. Okay?

That's not helping.


What does it look like?

Would you please just go?

I don't need a dumb big brother.

I'll buy it for you.

I just got my paycheck.
What else do you need?

You don't have to do this.

Okay? I can take care of myself.

I'm not so sure.

You can't even buy your own food.

It's not for me.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
So, who's the food for?

My mom.

What's her deal?

Hm. She's really sick.

It's... it's her own fault, though.

She's barely eating anymore.

Oh.

She used to like pizza.

So, where do you live?

Oh, she lost the apartment
a few weeks ago,

so I've just been sleeping wherever.

Are you gonna be okay?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

We have our cell group
at the church on Wednesday.

What's that? Is it,
like, prison or something?

Yeah, that's totally confusing.

It's just a group of friends.

We hang out,
and we're there for each other.

Yeah, that's cool.
I want you to come.

No. That's-that's not for me.

If you don't, I'll come find you.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

(HORN HONKS)
DANA: Rach!

Where have you been?
I've been waiting for forever.


Got to go.

Wednesday. Don't forget.

Hey.

Nathan Ballard.

Good to meet you, Nate.

DANA: Seriously, what have you been doing?

Are you seriously copying
Brian's homework?

He's got a 2.0.

Hey.
Hey.

Alert. Thrift store shopper.

MADISON (LAUGHS): Ew. Who would wear that?

Nothing wrong with vintage.

I guess.

You okay, Celine?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Is there anything
I can pray for you about?

MADISON: I will be so glad when you
get over this whole Jesus freak phase.

Oh, definitely don't do that with Alex.

I think he likes my spiritual side.

Trust me, it is a really big turnoff.

ERIC: I'd get rid of all the fat,
retarded, crippled,

stupid, ignorant,

rich, worthless people of this world.

Yeah.

No one is worthy of this planet.

Only me and who I choose.

Everyone should be sent out into space,

and only the people I say
should be left behind.

(DYLAN CHUCKLES QUIETLY)

BRIAN: Yo!

Look at these fartknockers!

(BOYS LAUGH)
What's up, four-eyes?

(STUDENTS GASP, GROAN)

(BOY LAUGHS)
Hey, yeah, help your buddy out, guys.

Good teamwork.
(BOYS LAUGHING)

(INDISTINCT SHOUT, LAUGHTER)

BRIAN: Yo, give me some.

BRIAN: Boom! Whoo!

(BOYS LAUGHING)

If only this was Columbine.

Bam!

(WEAPONS FIRING RAPIDLY)
Maybe it could be.

You're sick, man.

You're the one who brought it up.

I wasn't serious.

(WEAPONS STOP FIRING)


(WEAPON FIRING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Hey. Hey, guys.

Let's get started, okay?

I'll be right back.

(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

NATHAN: Hey.

I'm right here.

You scared me.
Now you know how it feels.

What are you doing?

Oh, I'm just making sure my dumb little
sister doesn't walk these streets by herself.

I brought some food for you to take home.

Or wherever.

Thanks.

You want to come inside?

No.

I-I don't.

I'll go play in traffic if you don't.


It's been such a stressful week.

I've got this huge test
coming up in physics.

And I hate physics.

Okay, well, we will pray for that.

(GIRL SIGHS)

I know it's your first time, but...

if you want to share
about how your week has been...

Yes, he does.
No, I don't.


(NATHAN SIGHS)

Um...

well...

my week kind of...

sucked.

It's... well, my dad's in jail,

and, uh...

my mom, sh... uh, she's a...
she's a heroin addict,

so she's... she's not eating anymore.

You know, it's, like...

She's staying in this house
that's full of junkies,

so I've been living in an alley
near here the past couple weeks.

And, uh...

it's just really hard to get a job,

you know, without an address.

Are you okay?


Where are you going?

What was I supposed to say?

That's exactly what you should have said.
No.

I'm not like them. And I'm...
definitely not like you.

How do you know?

You haven't even bothered
to get to know any of them.

Listen...

I get it.

You've had it rough.
Hey, Nate.

(WRY CHUCKLE) It's Nathan.

Nathan. (CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY)

Sorry. Um...

it's not much, but...

if you want, um, you could stay
at my place until you figure things out.

We got a couch in the basement.

If that doesn't work, um, I think...
some of the other guys

are checking with their parents, too.

Thanks, man.

That's...

You can call me Nate.

It's cool.

Tony.

(PHONE RINGS)

Eric?
ERIC: Why are you still at home?

You're three minutes late.

Oh, man. I slept in.

You slept in again? What,
you don't own an alarm clock?

I'm running late. So what?
Ride the bus, Eric.

I'm not gonna ride the bus
with those idiots!

Look, man, I'm not
your personal taxi service.

If you're not here
in five minutes, you're dead.

I know where you sleep.
(GROANS QUIETLY)


Hey, yo, R.J.!
Hey.

Got a date to prom yet?
No.

He never asked me.

What?

Want to bet on that?
Shut up.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Mm!

Sorry, R.J., this is Dave.

Just moved here from the Springs.

Hey.
Hey.

You like it here so far?

It's all right.

I don't really know many people yet.

Why'd you move?

Parents separated.

I've been through that.

Mom took us up here
and we moved in with my aunt.

Well, they're not divorced yet.

Maybe there's some hope.

Maybe.

Hey, I got to run,
but if you ever want to talk,

let me know.

All right.

Thanks.

I'm going to meet with my mentor.

Ooh, zee mentor.
The mentor.

Ow! Ow!

Get that part!

I just lost my date to prom.

(BOTH LAUGH)

I've never been in here all alone.

(QUIET LAUGH)

Well, I figure if we practice in here,

then when you audition,
it won't be such a big deal.

You'll be comfortable with the space.

Good idea.

Even though all the world's my stage.

And Alex and Rachel merely players.

They have their exits and their entrances.

Oh, bravo.

You know, that's a poem read
by a depressed guy about death.

Or life.

Depending on how you look at it.

Step on up here, my muse. This...

is where it all begins.

You are so full of it, Jason!

I'm done. I'm never talking to you again!

I know you can do better.

I just don't really believe you yet.

It's okay. Just close your eyes, okay?

And imagine how she feels.

Okay, the passion.

The anger.

The attraction.

I'm going to play practice.
Again?

Honey, that's every night this week.

Mom, you know how important this is to me.

Yes, I know, but don't be late.

You have homework to get done.

And I expect you to stay up as late

as you need to to get it done!
Okay!


ALEX: You know, my... my parents,
they weren't really there for me.

My dad just up and left when I was a kid.

My mom was left with nothing.

(QUIET LAUGH)

I haven't talked to him in years.

It leaves a hole inside, doesn't it?

Yeah.

(BOTH LAUGH)

Whoa...
Oh, wow.

Madison didn't tell me
you were that good at ballet.

I have many secret talents.
Mm.

ALEX (VOICE-OVER): I'm about
to fail this geometry test.

Thank God I'm an artist.

You need a mentor?

Oh, only if it's you.

(GIRLS SQUEALING)

You're welcome.

I take complete credit for this.

You look so cute together!
What happened?

Tell me!

I'll see you guys.
See you.

Hey, you.
Hey.

How's the play going?

So good.

I think this senior guy likes me,

and we totally connect in so many ways.

Well, it better not be in every way.

Don't worry, he's great.

Hey!

Hey, don't read that!
I want to be in the mind

of Rachel Joy, to know
everything about you.

I've pretty much told you.

"Oh, God, give me strength.

"Help me choose a path
we both know is right.

The path that leads to you."

What's that all about?

Just some stuff I wrote a while ago.

(ALEX SCOFFS)

Wouldn't just call it "stuff."

That's really good.

(QUIET LAUGH)

Don't you think it's weird
how similar our families are?

Yeah.

Yeah, we're like...

I think we were meant to find each other.

We both know the same pain.

Yeah.

But it's okay, you know,
'cause pain, it...

it gives us an energy that
we can channel for our art.

I mean, sometimes you need
the darkness to bring the light.

Yeah.

Now, use the pain!

You are so full of it, Jason. I'm done.

I'm never talking to you again.

Well, that's just it.

We can't be done.

I love you.

Was that acting, or was it real?

Well, aren't they the same?

You were brilliant.

My acting or the kiss?

(ALEX CHUCKLES)

You're ready.

I'm Rachel Joy Scott,
and I'm auditioning for the role of Andi

in "The Chance of Possibility."


Yes!

# I got the role, I got the role #

# I got the role #

# Got the role, got the role #


# Role... #

Hey.

So?

Yeah, I got the lead role!

Oh!
Congratulations, girl!

The drama queen finally has her crown.

Hey, I heard Alex is gonna
rewrite the play for you.

How'd you know?

He told me... how great you were.

He kissed me, too.

Oh!
Oh, my God!

You got the part and the boy.

Everything you wanted.
Your life is complete.

It's nice to be wanted for once.

Yeah.
Maddy?

Thanks.
Oh...

You're a great friend.
Don't get all mushy on me.

It's not a big deal.
It is a big deal.

It's, like, her first one.
So cute.

Maybe we'll go to prom together.
Oh!

Easy, tiger, let's see if we can
make it past Christmas first.

(GUNFIRE FROM VIDEO GAME)

I hate this school.

Yeah... me, too.

We'll get our revenge.

Kick natural selection up a few notches.

This is Jesus's blood shed for you.

Do this in remembrance of him.

This is Christ's body.

Do this in remembrance of him.

This is Jesus's blood shed for you.

Do this in...

(BELLS JINGLING)

Hey.
Hey.

Did you get the job?

Yeah.

(GASPS, SQUEALS)

I mean, I mean, I finally had an address
I could put on that application.

Thanks.

For everything.
I don't... know where I'd be.

Hey, it's what little sisters do.

You want to come sit?

Oh, I'm staying with Clay's family
till I save up for first month's rent.

That's awesome.

I meant to ask you...
what's with the dog tags?

Oh.

These are my grandfather's.

He fought in World War II.

Were you close to your grandpa?

Yeah.

I... I mean, I lived
with him until he died.

He pretty much raised me as a kid.

Wow.

I love it.

Super vintage.

(QUIET LAUGH)

So, I got you something.

Yeah... close your eyes.

Huh.

Merry Christmas.

Uh, what is it?

It's a journal.

So you can write down your thoughts
or poems or songs or whatever.

And then any time you have a thought
or we want to tell each other something,

you just put it in there
and we can trade it back and forth.

All right.

It's cool. (CHUCKLES)

Uh...

how's the play going?

So good.

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

When do I get to meet Alex?

I don't know.

Sometime.

Uh, why don't you just
invite him to cell group?

I don't know if it's his thing.

Well, it wasn't my thing, either.

Uh, hey, you... thanks for this.

It's... cool. I mean, most people
wouldn't give a freak like me a journal.

(QUIET LAUGH)

I'm glad you like it.

I'm gonna draw a lot of pictures.

(LAUGHS) Good.
(NATHAN CHUCKLES)


Thank you, guys.
Yay!

Did you make a wish?
I bet she forgot.

Yes, of course.

Happy birthday.

Well, this box isn't
big enough for an Acura.

Exactly.

But it is big enough for the key.

Oh, my... Thank you!
You're welcome.


Thanks, Mom!

Now, your mom and I can trust you,
right... not to do something

stupid or illegal with the car?

Yes.

We just want you to be safe.

Pinky promise.

That doesn't even mean anything.

Yes, it does.

Thank you.


(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

# Your eyes... #

(PARTYGOERS CLAMORING)

You know, prom's coming up.

Oh, yeah, it is.

What, in like two months?


Hmm.

So where do you think,
like, we are right now?

In the woods?
No.

Like... like, in our relationship,
like, where do you think we are?

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Well, I don't know, I mean,
I feel like what we have is so good,

I-I don't want to mess it up
by putting a title on it, you know?

Yeah.

No, I like it, too.

Just... sometimes it's kind of nice
to know if something's official.

ALEX: Hmm.

Yeah, I just...

I just don't think you can always
define things with words, you know?

I feel like what we have
is so much stronger

than human constructs like language.

Yeah.

I think we should just
let it be what it is.

And what's that?

A heart connection.

But are we, like, exclusive?

I mean, I know I am.

No, I... I can't imagine connecting
with anyone like we have.

I think I'm ready to take it
to the next level.

A toast.

To the famous actors.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): That was so awesome
you invited those kids to Break Thru.


NATHAN (VOICE-OVER):
Yeah, they're good kids.

Saw them on the streets every day.

You would've done the same thing.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): I wish
you had your own phone line.

Pray I won't drink this weekend.

I don't know how to describe it.

I feel numb.

Distant from God.

I don't know why.

I have nothing to complain about.

Everything's going great.

NATHAN (VOICE-OVER): I wish you could
tell me what's going on with you,

'cause I want to try to make it better.

I'm gonna do a lot of praying for you
this week, 'cause, uh, I think you need it.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
My passion has sunk to a new low.


I want more.


I ask for a bigger desire
of it, but it's like I'm stuck.

I want to tap into something higher.

I hope you understand what I'm saying,

'cause I don't know how else to say it.

NATHAN (VOICE-OVER): You know,
we seek for answers in a world of lies.

Just don't believe
the lies Satan will tell you.

You feel like God's not watching.

But you're number one in his sight,
'cause believe me,

when you're stuck and you feel
like you can't go any further,

he still believes in you.

Sorry, I got to go to bed now.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): Pain, pain, go away.

Come again another day.

Because of you, I'm led astray.

(VACUUM HUMMING)

I'm sorry, but it wasn't mine.

Either way, it's not exactly legal to
drive around minors who are drinking.

We trusted you.

Mom, I wasn't drinking.

Maybe you should just quit the play.

Mom, you can't do that.

We're a few days away, and that's
not fair to everybody involved.

You come in smelling like smoke.

Dana says you're not even
going to Break Thru anymore.

What's going on?

I'm fine.

I don't like you going to these parties.

That's where people are
that need light the most.

I'm trying to make an impact.

I think they're impacting you
more than you're impacting them.

I'm gonna take away your keys until
your mom says you can have them back.

Are you serious?

Guys, I didn't do anything.

Don't forget to recycle.

Hey, stranger.

Hey.

I... miss seeing you around.

I know. I'm sorry.

Just been really busy
with the play and stuff.

Yeah.
But, hey, opening night's this week.

Are you gonna come?

I wouldn't miss it.

And I got you an Easter present.

Easter?

Is that not a thing?
(LAUGHS) No.

But I'll take it.

Nate...

are you sure?

If it weren't for you and my grandpa,

I don't know where I'd be.

You accepted me for who I am, and...

I want you... I want you to have them.

So sweet.

I love it.

Really.

What's up with the hemp necklace?

It's not really your style.

Alex gave it to me.

Yeah, why don't you bring him around?

I just don't know where I stand
with him right now exactly.

What does he say?

Just that we're gonna finish the play,
and then we'll figure things out.

I mean, is he kissing you
while he figures things out?

Sort of.

"Sort of"?

But most of it's for the play.


Well, is he a Christian?

He's really spiritual.

I thought you said you wanted
a Christian boyfriend.

He really respects my faith.

He just believes in a lot
of things right now.

I don't know why you
mess around with that guy.

You know, out of all people,
I didn't think you would judge him.

I'm-I'm not judging. I'm just...

Uh, Rachel, I think you're being stupid.

You know, I thought I could
talk to you about this.

Well, you can.

For the first time,
someone really wants me.

He makes me feel like I am somebody.

Rach, I think you really
deserve someone better.

He is better.


(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Places, everyone.


What if we lived in a world
with endless possibilities?

But is that even possible?

Gosh, Andi, don't be so impossible.
I'm not!

I'm full of possibilities.

I don't know what you want me to say.

Why not give possibility a chance? Right?

Is there still a chance
we can give this a possibility?


You are so full of it, Jason! I'm done!

I'm never talking to you again!

But that's just it.

We can't be done.

I love you.

CROWD: Aw...


(WHISTLING, CHEERING)

(CHEERING, WHISTLING)

Awesome.
Thank you, Austin.

That means a lot.

Hey, I'm gonna go, but you did awesome.

Bye.

Hey.

Hey, Rach.

Uh...

Mm.
Yeah.

You...

you were real good, you know?

Some of those lines
were a little weird, though.

(LAUGHS) Thank you.
Who's the critic?

Nice suit.

You must be Alex.

Um, Alex, this is Nathan.

Alex wrote the play.

So, what'd you think?

I liked everything about it... except you.

Let's get out of here, Rach.
We're going to Shep's.

RACHEL: Bye, Nate.

NATHAN: Hey.

You better take care of her.

I think Rachel can take care of herself.

I don't know what she needs you for.

(CHATTER STOPS)
Nate, stop it!

What are you doing?

(CHATTER RESUMES)

He's like a white hat alumni,
and he can't even dress himself.

I'm so sorry. I...
I've never seen him like that.

I'm not gonna let any negative
energy intrude tonight.

It's time to celebrate.

Let's party, guys!
(SHOUTING, WHOOPING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


Now that the play's over, I really
want to figure things out with Alex.

What's there to figure out?
You guys are a thing.

It doesn't totally feel like it.

You missed a button.

(CELINE CHUCKLES)

Celine, I...

I worry about you
with always having a new...

What?

Leave me alone. I'm just having fun.

You should have some fun, too.


ALEX: Oh, hey-hey, look who we have here.

You know, Madison might have been
the best ballet dancer in the fourth grade,

but Rachel is by far the best actress

in the school.
Alex, you're such a spaz.

We produced a hit play!

(CHEERING, SHOUTING)

You look ravishing tonight.

Part of me is glad the play's over.

It's loud. Do you want to...
go somewhere we can be alone?

I can't do this.
It's okay. Just trust me.

There's dog food in here. (CLEARS THROAT)

We can go somewhere else.

No. That's not what I'm saying.

Well, I thought you wanted
to take it to the next level.

No, not like this.

I meant a commitment.

I don't even know what we are.

You don't?

After all that we've felt together?

I mean...

just...

be in the moment
and go with those feelings.

Trust me, I... I want what you want.

I'm not so sure.

I need some space.
Rachel...

(FAINT MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Have you seen Alex?

I thought he was with you.

No, we were making out...

TMI, girl.

I think you should just chill.

No, I have to find him
before things get weird.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Madison?

Rach...
What?

It just happened.
How could you do that?

You were being kind of high-maintenance.

I just wanted to explain...

why I left and...

what I believe in and...

I don't really respond
to limitations, Rachel.

MADISON: I told you that this Jesus
freak thing would be an issue.

ALEX: Wait, are you...?
Are you, like, a...

serious Christian?






(GUN COCKS, FIRES)


Looks like you needed a better boyfriend.

He wasn't my boyfriend.

Then you needed a better mentor.

You don't like me much, do you?

intolerant, self-righteous hypocrites.

That's a pretty intolerant stereotype
to put on millions of Christians.

God's just some outdated
cultural construct.

How can you really believe in some being
up in the sky that you can't even see?

Sometimes you have to see with your heart.


Is this when you try and convert me?

I'm not like that.

I just want to live my life for Jesus

and let people take
whatever they want from that.

That's cool.

You sound more like
a Buddhist than a Christian.

Maybe you should get to know one.

(ENGINE STARTS NEARBY)

It's second period.

Where's Celine going?

SEAN: I don't know.


Who cares?

I care.

(MAN AND WOMAN SHOUTING)

What do you want?

Why aren't you at school?

Just didn't feel like it.

What are you... my parole officer?

No.

Celine, I just wanted to talk.

(GLASS BREAKS)
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

Who is that?

Look, now's not the best time, okay?

I'll call you later.

Celine... I am sick of ignoring it all
and pretending like

everything's okay with you.

Oh, please, Little Miss Perfect.

How could you possibly
understand? (SCOFFS)

I know what it's like to be in pain.

You don't know anything.

You think you make a difference here?

Well, you don't.

Celine, I'm not trying to fix anything.

You change nothing.

(DOOR SLAMS)

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): Nate,
I wish you were here right now.

I wish I could be numb to the pain,

instead of numb to God
and you and everyone else.

I feel like I'm fading away.

Like I'm beyond repair.

I don't even want
to live through the night.


Things are coming at me

from all different directions,
and they can't be blocked.

There's nothing you can say or do to help.

I know that's hard to hear.

I put this face on as a strong
Christian to everyone but you.

But I'm not like that on the inside.

I'm just not as strong as you.


Words don't seem to help anymore.

Maybe we shouldn't write.

(DISTORTED VOICE-OVER): I'm worthless.

I make no difference.

No one notices.

No one understands.

No one cares.

Not even God.

I'm drowning in my own wake of despair.

Choking, my hands
are wrapped around my neck.

I'm dying.

Quickly my soul leaves.

It isn't suicide.

I consider it homicide.

The world you have created
has led to my death.

Hey.

Hey, no, I'm-I'm so sorry.

I don't... I don't know
what's gotten into me lately.

You know, and I... I did not mean
to lose it on that guy, just, I... I was

really just trying to look out for you.

No, no... You were right.

I should've listened to you.

Are you okay?

You kind of saved my life today.

I did?

Yeah.

I wasn't in a good place,
and I just wanted it all to end.

And I thought it was the only way out.

But then I saw your dog tags.

And I was like, "If-if I die,
he's gonna think it's all his fault."

And I didn't want you going through life
thinking it had been all your fault.

'Cause that fight we had.

Okay, you...

I'm-I'm glad you're here.

Me, too.

If you need to talk, you know,
you can... you can talk to me.

I miss my big brother.

Do you want to go inside? I mean,

everyone's gonna be
really excited to see you.

(RACHEL SIGHS)

Okay.
Okay?

Dear Heavenly Father, Lord,
we just thank you right now.

God, we just ask for your...

for your strength over Rachel, Lord.

We just want her to feel
your presence, Lord,

and experience some peace.

God, I just thank you for loving her...

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
I am not going to apologize

for speaking the name of Jesus.

And I'm not going to hide the light
that God has put in me.

If I have to sacrifice everything...

...I will.

I will take it.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(VOICE-OVER): I lost most
of my friends at school.

BRIAN: That's kind of weird.

GABBY: She's spending time
with Jesus or whatever.

BRIAN: What does that even mean?

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER): Now that I've begun
to walk my talk, they make fun of me.

But you know what?

It's all worth it to me.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CHATTER CONTINUES)

So, how's everything else going with you?

You know, being betrayed
by your best friend sucks.

But the worst part was that he
didn't know I was a Christian.

Rach, you just got to be you.

I know.

I wasn't being real.

I'm not gonna let that happen again.

Check this out.

Okay.

So, you're not gonna be a...

beer-chuggin', pot-trippin',
cigar-puffin', drug-dealin' Christian?

No, I'm a God-lovin'...
Huh?

Satan-slammin', Jesus-freakin',
world-changin' Christian.

Warrior for Christ.

Oh, that's-that's tight.

Well, people aren't gonna
accept us for our faith.

But it's okay.

We have to love and serve them anyways.

And I'm talking compassion, forgiveness.

I mean, if we don't,
what's gonna attract them to God?

So...

what about Madison?

Well, maybe not her.


(BELL RINGING)

Oh, the angry ex is coming over.

Madison, can we talk?

What for?

Oh, my gosh.
Would you look at her clothes?

MADISON:
Talk about your thrift store special.

Like, someone else's B.O. is in that.

Madison, when can we talk?

I don't see any real reason to, Rachel.

It is what it is.

I can't help what happened, so...

just... go, all right?

Hey. I'm Rachel.


RACHEL: Is that vintage?

Looks great on you.

It's a little too pastel for my taste.

Hi. I'm Celine.

Reagan.
(LAUGHS)

Hey, Rach, look, about the other day,

it's just my mom and her drunk boyfriend.

They're all messed up. (WRY LAUGH)

I just didn't want anyone to know.

Celine, I wouldn't tell anybody.

I just worry about you.

Why? I'm, like, the most perfect kid.


You know, my mom would
totally let you stay with us.

We should probably stop ignoring her.

It's gonna be like Oklahoma City,
the L.A. riots and World War II

all mixed into one.
Yeah.

Like a video game.

I-I want to leave a lasting
impression on this stupid world.

Start a chain reaction.
Yeah.

(IMITATING GUNS FIRING)

Boom!
Bah!

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
I've always been drawn to hands.

I think it's because it's
the way that we touch people.

Compassion is the greatest form
of love that humans have to offer.

I have this theory that if one person

can go out of their way
to show compassion,

it could start a chain reaction.

How do you know that trust and beauty

and compassion won't make the
world a better place to be in?

Tomorrow's not a promise...

but it's a chance.

You just might start a chain reaction.

And what's behind all of this is my faith.

I'm a Christian.

And... I'm not trying to be weird,

or convert anybody or anything like that.

I just wanted to be real with you guys
and let you know who I am.

Jesus gave his life for me...

and I'll give my life to him.

Just wanted to get that out there.

Thank you, Rachel.

Okay, up next...

we have Eric and Dylan.

Let's watch their video
on how they would change the world.

Those bullies are always picking on me,

and I don't like it.

Can you help?
ERIC: Yeah. You know we...

can't have weapons on school grounds.

But if you can get them away,
we'll take them out.

DYLAN: For $2,000, we'll get rid of them.

Permanently.

(GUNSHOTS BOOMING)


(GUNSHOT BOOMS)


Okay, I think we've seen enough.

That... would make the world
a better place.

Yo. It's... it's Rachel, right?

Yeah. We've only been
in class together all semester.

I know. I'm bad with names.

Hey, I didn't know you were a Christian.

Now you do.

Now everybody does.

Was it too much?

No. That was dope.

I've been a Christian for a while now.

Just started going to FCA, though.

I had no idea.

It took me a little while
to find my place around here,

being the new guy and all,
but... I'm all good now.

I've been here my whole life,
and I'm still working on it.

back there was really cool.

You inspired me.

Hey.

Look out for my friend Austin
when I'm not around.

All right.

Got it.

Later, Rachel.

Later.
Ah.

I remembered.

(K.J. CHUCKLES)

ERIC: What's your problem?

What?
I know you did that.

Did what?
I didn't stop your stupid Jesus speech.

You think you're better than us?
No. No,

I'm not better than anybody.
Oh, I know you're not.

I got to get to class.

You're just like all the others.

Compassion. Yeah, that'll work.

So, you gonna go?

Hey, R.J.

So, has, uh...

Alex begged you to take him back yet?

No. He's into Madison's aura now.

Well, good, because...

Look, we always said that
if we never find anyone else,

then... we would go.

I'd be honored.

Yeah?
Yes.

May I have this dance, mademoiselle?
Yes, you may.

Bethanie!

Oh! Thanks for coming.
I wouldn't miss

helping you get ready for prom.
Aah!

Look at that dress!

Oh, it's perfect!
Let's get you ready.

# Oh, oh, oh... #

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

# Oh, oh, oh #

# Whoa, oh #

# Oh, oh, oh #

# Whoa, oh #

# Oh, oh, oh #

# Whoa, oh #

# Whoa, oh, oh #

# Whoa, oh, oh... #

(SONG ENDS, GENTLE PIANO INTRO PLAYS)

# I saw it in your eyes #

# Tonight #

# The disappointment that #

# You tried to hide #

# Wondering if the world you... #

(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

So, I hear you and Kevin
are writing next year's play.

Yeah.

Mrs. Diaz asked us.

You'll do great.

Let me know if you need any help.

Technically, I'm still your mentor.
(LAUGHS)

Always the generous one.

Oh, look.

They're playing our song.

We don't have a song.

I know.

I wish we would have, though.

This one would have been a good one.

# The night is young,
you are mine tonight... #

Hey.

I wish it didn't go down like that.

You know, I... I never meant
to be drawn to her energy.

I couldn't help it.

# Sparkling, sparkling... #

Well, it hurt.

A lot.

I'm trying to forgive you.

I don't know, I...

I think we just view life differently.

Yeah.

Although we can agree on one thing.

All the world's a stage.

And the men and women merely players.

They have their entrances...

and their exits.

Bye, Alex.

Let's get out of here.

All right.
Hey, Maddy?

I miss you.

# Shimmering and shining #

# Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh. #

(SONG ENDS)

Hey, C. Having fun?

(CELINE SIGHS)

How can you stand talking to her?

I would have made
a voodoo doll or something.


I don't know.

It's... it's hard.

But...

I think forgiveness is one of those things

that can change the world.

Always trying to change the world.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

I'm so tired, Rachel.

Of all of this.

Of my life.

I don't even know why I'm here.

Well... usually, you come to these things

to make out with guys, so...

(BOTH LAUGH)

I just want something like you have.

You can handle the pain.

Come over next week,
when we don't have, like,

people dancing around us...
(LAUGHS)

and we'll talk.

We'll talk all about it.

Yeah.

I can't believe I'm saying this.

But maybe I'll even do
that whole breakdown,

breakout, break dancing that you do.

Break Thru?
Yeah. Whatever.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(QUIET, INDISTINCT CHATTER)

RACHEL: Why can't I see my future?

I can't picture myself going to college...

getting married.

Any of it.

Nate...

if God loves me so much,

why does he put me through so much pain?

I mean...

I don't know.

Life's gonna be hard sometimes.

But...

he's there.

You know?

And, uh...

as hard as that is to grasp...

he's in control.

Hey, Austin.

How's it going?
Going to chemistry.

You want to do something this weekend?

Uh, with who?

With me. We can go, like,

see a movie or something Friday.
We...

we go on a-a real date?

Yeah. Sure.

Have you ever been on one?

Oh, yeah. Lots of them.

I didn't know you were such a player.

With my mom.

Got it.

Well, sorry I'm not your mom.

You're prettier.

You are a player!

See you Friday, Austin.

AUSTIN (QUIETLY): Yes!

BRIAN: Yo, at least a nine.

K.J.: I hear you, bro.
Yeah, I see you. I see you.

BRIAN: Got that 2.0, baby!

(BOYS LAUGHING, WHOOPING)

K.J.: Yo.

Look, I mean, you keep throwing,
you keep hitting like you do, bro...

Hey, man, just trying to be more like you.

Just make it... make it do
what it do, bro.

Hey-hey-hey, hold up. Is it...

Andrew?
Au-Austin.

K.J. (CHUCKLING): Right. Austin.

I suck with names.

Give it here, man.

Yeah.

Check this freak out.

Yo, you got a problem?

Let's bounce.
Come with?

Sure.

Are you sure about this?

Yeah, I'm sure.
All right.

Here, buddy.
Yeah.

When the bombs blow up,
it's gonna be awesome.

Boom!

The library will fall on the cafeteria,
and when they all run out,

we'll be waiting outside to take 'em out.

Time for a kick start!

Finally, we are gonna make things right.

We'll be heroes.

Heil Hitler.

I can hear 'em now.

If... only we would
have reached them sooner,

(MOCK CRYING): or-or found this tape!

Oh, if only we would
have searched their rooms.

If only we would have asked
the right questions!

Too late.

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
Am I the only one who sees?

Am I the only one who craves your glory?

All I want is for someone to walk
with me through these halls of tragedy.

There's something in me
that makes me want to cry...

...and I don't even know what it is.

RADIO DEEJAY: Good morning.

It's Tuesday, April the 20th, 1999.

We have a clear, sunny spring morning
in the Denver metro.

On this day 110 years ago,

Adolf Hitler was born.

Creepy.
Also on this day in hist...

BETH: Rachel! You're going to be late.

Love you, Mom. Bye.
Mm.

Craig! Come on, let's go!

I love you, too.
(DOOR OPENS)

(HONKS HORN)
Come on!

I'm coming.

Finally. How's your hair?

Perfect.

(FRUSTRATED GROAN) No spots.

Now we have to park
across the street again.

CRAIG: Sorry.

(LAUGHS)
Why do you wear this anyway?

Those white hats are bullies.
Well, I'm not one.

I know. I just don't want
people to think you are.

It's just what the team wears.
Hey. Well, think about it.

Is that what you want to be known for?

CRAIG: Later, lame-o.

(BELL RINGING)

ERIC: Dylan, give me the list.

Hey, Rachel.
Hey.

Hey, um... do you think
we could talk at lunch?

Is it your parents again?

Yeah. Yeah, let's talk outside.

No one will bother us out there.

Cool. Thanks.

Yeah.
See you.

MADISON: And I want a cute dress.

Oh, I need to get my nails redone.

These are already chipped.
I'll go with you.

You want to go after school?
Yeah.

Read this. Okay?

Yeah. Okay.

What is this?

I have no idea?

(BELL RINGING)

Rachel, that's amazing.

What is it?

Just something I was inspired to draw.

It's not finished.

It's my tears.

DIAZ: 13 tears.

Why 13?

I don't know yet.

Rachel, I see a bright future
ahead for you.

I'm gonna make a difference in the world.

Somehow.

Rachel...

I have no doubt you will.

Hold on. Hey, Rach.

Hey.

I, uh...

read your letter.

Good.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

Uh...

we're going to lunch.

Want to come? It's just me and Gabby.

Thanks, but I already told Dave
Rogers I'd eat with him, so...

(LAUGHS) Do you even know him?
No.

No, not really, but...

he says he needs to talk, so...

Okay.
Yeah.

But hey, uh, tomorrow, maybe?

Yeah.
Meet at lunch?

Totally. Okay.
Yeah?

Tomorrow?
Yeah.

Okay.
See ya. (LAUGHS)

Bye.
Bye.

Hey.

Hey. How are you?

I'm good. You ready?

Yeah.

They're going through with the divorce.

It just sucks.

Well, you know.

Yeah.

It's been ten years,
and it's still tough on me.

Look who it is.

DYLAN: It's past the time.

It should have went off already.


How'd you get through it?

I don't know.
Mm.

There's no easy answer.

But I don't think that God
wastes anything.

Not even the bad stuff.

Is this some kind of prank?
ERIC: Go! Go!

(GUNS COCK)


(GASPS WEAKLY)

ERIC: Well, Rachel...

where's your God now?
(CRYING)

What would Jesus do?

(DYLAN LAUGHS)

(DYLAN CHUCKLES)

Do you still believe in God?

You know I do.

Then go be with him.

(BOOMING GUNSHOT ECHOES)

(WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY)

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

(SIREN WAILING)

NEWSMAN: Here at Columbine High School,

eyewitnesses say that
two gunmen came in shooting

and began working their way
through the school.

At first, many students
dismissed it as a prank,

until teachers raced ahead to classrooms,
yelling for students to run.

into the cafeteria,

and you could hear, like,
(EXPLOSION)

bombs and shotguns going off.

And then he came into the library...

and he was gonna kill us
if we were of color,

and... if we had a hat.

People were getting shot all around me.

NEWSMAN: 12 students
and one teacher were killed,

and more than 25 seriously injured

before the two teenage shooters
took their own lives.

To the people of the community
of Littleton...

I can only say tonight that the prayers
of the American people are with you.

(ECHOING BOOM FADES)


(SOBBING GASPS)

CRAIG (VOICE-OVER): I'm sorry, Rach.

weren't my last words to you.

(SHUDDERING SIGH)

If I... if I had that moment again,
I would have told you I love you.

SEAN (VOICE-OVER): I don't know
why they killed her.

Rachel never judged.

She was what a Christian ought to be.


MADISON (VOICE-OVER): Hey, Rach.

(CRYING, SNIFFLING): It's me, Maddy.

I miss you.

And I just wanted you to know that
you taught me about forgiveness.


I think you'd find it really ironic

that I'm meeting with Amy,
that cell chick leader.


Thank you for never giving up on me.

(CRYING, SNIFFLING)

What, uh...

...what happened to her...

I haven't lived the best life.

And, uh, people always
saw me as a problem,

and I... I prayed that...

God would send me somebody to love me,

to make me feel wanted.

I just thank God for sending me an angel.

She was, and, uh...

she made me feel special when I
didn't even know what that was.

And, uh...

...she...

I know you're in Heaven, Rachel, and...

I want you to know that I will love you

until I see you there one day.

(SNIFFLES SOFTLY)


YOUNG RACHEL: These hands
belong to Rachel Joy Scott...

TEENAGE RACHEL: And will someday
touch millions of people's hearts.
