I have no idea

Back then women

Not without a job or prospects

All she had was her
paintings in the trunk

And his daughter in the backseat

We receive many ladies here

Then your husband approves you work?

My husband and I are separated

Separated?

world famous Margaret Ulbrich

Queen of the Bay

In mere minutes capture your soul

Do Not

Dont you wish you were your

That's me

And that's me

And that I was until my mom
He became a Chinese boy

I did not understand the situation

Well I better go before Mr, Ulbrich
come and hit me in the eye

Mr, Ulbrich is no longer in the image

Good night, Henry

Sorry for not calling to book

Lucky I have a table list,
madame

Good evening, welcome

Plz follow me

And do I have to pay a dime because
I gave the chef a painting

You know what he said?
-- What?

He said nobody paints my country
as the great Walter Keane

I can not believe you
lived in Paris

The best time of my life

I've never been on a plane

You have to experiment
these things

You have to catch them

I wanted to be an artist so

I went alone

I studied painting there

I lived in a studio

I survived on bread and wine

You're a romantic

Yes, I am!

Of course go there
was not easy

I had to quit my job

Leaving my wife

Yes

these decisions
are not easy

I have never acted
freely

I was a child and then
a wife and then a mother

All my paintings are Jane
because she's all I know

Do not belittle your work

Have an amazing talent

You can see someone and capture
on your canvas

You can paint people

I can only paint things

I mean, my streets are ,,,

lovely

But at the end of the day

They are just a collection of buildings
and sidewalks

Walter, I bet you can
paint whatever

When you look at me so

You could fall in love strongly

Sorry

This goes really fast

I have not been on a date
in a while

Jane, honey, stop moving

Mother after all this time must
know how my face looks

Hey, your canvas is blank

You can not rush inspiration

Do not bother Mr, Keane creativity
comes from within

Do not worry

She does not bother me

I can ask you a question?

What about the large
and crazy eyes?

Oh

Well, I think you can see things

Eye

The eyes are the window
soul

Yes but

The pints in a way very
out of proportion

Okay

The eyes are like Express
my emotions

I have always painted well

When I was little I had surgery
I leave me deaf for a while and

I could not hear so

I stared

Trust the eyes of people

Walter?

Hey, Walt, I thought it was you!

I'm glad to see you

Hear about permissions
for Thursday

Yes? excellent

I'll architects

Ok

What was that?

I did not want you to know

I am in commercial property

You're a real estate agent?

Yes

I am a successful agent, the top of the
office, 3 years on the job

And you ashamed?

Any fool can fix
a sublet

Everything I've ever wanted is
keep me as an artist

I tried to start from scratch

But I did not succeed

I'm just a Sunday painter

Thank You

Sign in here

Put it here

Here?
-- If there is great

I would like that is not
in the way

namely

In something I'm working

You can see

I'm working ,,,

hello

What happens?

Frank wants to take Jane

He says I'm not a proper mother

And ,,,
-- You're perfect

He told the court that

She lacks a suitable house

And that is beyond my
capabilities

As a single mother

Will you marry me?

Do not think of a reason
to say no

Because I have a million reasons
to say that if

I know it makes no sense

But think how much
enjoy ourselves

And I will cherish, girls

Margaret

I'm on one knee

Come on, you say?

Let's get married

We could be in Hawaii
the weekend

Oh, Hawaii, marriage

I do not know Walter I'm crazy about you
but I am very overwhelmed

Why we would go to Hawaii?

Because you're a princess

And you deserve to get married in paradise

You were right

It's paradise

Only God could create these colors

I told you!

We can not stay here
forever?

I do not know if forever

But I guess I could
Fix a week

There was a waterfall and the air was
so fresh you could taste

And this was an ancient altar

That is a statue of Kane
the god of creation

I prayed

Those are Walter and Jane built
the sandcastle together

Well, this happens
very fast

In the time you moved here
I have been on 2 appointments and you and you married

Well I guess there was a gap in
Walter filled my life

Walter has filled many things

It's got all the skirts
art

You're talking about my husband

I know, why I mentioned

I'm not naive

I am naive but

I know who I married

Walter can be impulsive but
It is a good provider

Yes wonderful with Jane

I'm just looking to start from scratch,
I am a divorcee with a girl

Walter is a blessing

Thank You

These on the threshold of incredible success

The theme of the composition is
spontaneity

The image has no center
visual attention

It is very gestural
-- Definitely

Heavily influenced by Tashes

Listen to a famous was
here looking

Well, I'm not allowed to say

Christ

Do not go here right now
please

Ruben

good Morning

You have a moment?

Walter, you're missing the word, quote

I can come back later

You'll love my stuff today

I have not seen that before?

No that was painted at 5

This is the 6th Street

I do not understand, you lived in Paris
for a week

As you can continue taking
paintings?

Everything is here

And here

Well it will not go up here

Walter know you do not go
these representations

You are very literal

Art is a fashion
-- If it is

People want Kandinsky
or Rafko

They do not want

Street scenes

How about this?

My God you've come
to a new period

Do Not

They are from my wife

Why your eyes are so big?

As large gumdrops
and quiet

It's expressionism

Surely you recognize

Well, I'm glad that
have been found

Then you say

I say no, it is not art

It is not art?

I paint for a magazine,
you know the turtle draws

Win a contest

How dare you? A lot
People you may like

If someone but not
enters through

Now please clean this before
good taste police come

It is a secret society of owners
galleries and critics

We will meet on Sunday
to eat something

And recite what is great

As at hearings
McCarthy

I point to this painter
I exiling that painter

There is no man's land

I think people buy
art that touches

If you live in a fairy tale

People unable to discover anything

Buy art because it is in the
time and place indicated

Ok, a welcome to Cal Jader

Well, sure to stay
for the show's 1:00 a,m,

Enjoy, enjoy

apology

Hey I love Banducci
music tonight

this brilliant
-- Thank you, thank

Walter Keane

I am a painter

I was watching your walls

They are very empty

Maybe you're right

What color would seem like good?

No, no

I am an artist, used to live in Paris

Now I have moved to
USA

And I look ,,,

An exhibition debut

I like my club as is

If your stuff is so good
sees it in a museum

I respect that you are a
businessman

Not a charity

such

If I rent your walls?

Walter, Margaret?

Ready?

An art lover

Beautiful, that I can do
for you sir?

Just looking for the bathroom

Thank You

Look at that girl

This sad

It is poor?

It has been forgotten

Makes me want to mourn

You're Keane?

Yes, I am

You're a great painter

Thank you, thank you very much

Your work is very powerful

There are so many emotions
in those eyes

Is something wrong?

Do Not

I did not realize you were talking
the picture of my wife

Oh I get it

The artist does not want to get rid
your favorite piece

Oh honey, thanks

I love him

I had not delayed

Hey Picasso

Good place no?

Thanks for that closet
where I put brooms

Are you talking about? It's just

When people drink have
to relieve themselves

It is insulting

When people see art not
should think about defecating

Hey, careful what you say

Hey, there are ladies present

Never hit a deposit
before

Sorry, laughed Banducci
our art so I fell

Since when are you like? the artists
should handle criticism

you are right

He was already in a bad place

He had taken a couple of drinks and
someone thought I painted your big eyes

What?

I do not understand because
would you do that?

It was a misunderstanding

And then I did not want to compromise
sale

Well do not do it again

Hey
-- Me you do not have a bad time

I only came for my stuff

Can you believe it?
We are exhausted

I even have a chef

It is a Monday!

Walter

We arrived to home page

People are here because
want to see the paintings

Vera adult men fighting

I'm sick of you Keane

I'll see you in court

Son of a bitch!

I'm going to sue
-- I'm tired of you

And your paintings

I'm going to sue for insulting
and offend my great paintings!

Walter Keane was not a
subtle man

But the subtle does not sell

Yes sir

It was a good circus what they did

Dick Nolan, examiner

Hey friend, not you
remove the dream

I take these things with a spoon
gives me something to write

In my column

I thought you wrote only
celebrities

Banducci is famous
and you hit

So you're a celebrity
now

Buy me a drink

Hey Gary

Then, Walter

Tell me about your work

When I was in paris

No, that does not

I refer to the homeless kids

awake

You were a success

That night!

I sold all your big eyes

They love you

Need more paintings!

Walter!
-- Now!

Quiet, this is an opportunity

We must seize
as a team

Go to clubs

You do what you love

Get out

I love you

They know a poet once said

The eyes are the windows to the soul

That's why I paint so great,
I've always done well

If you are interested in that style
I'm working on pieces

I have a blond kid

In a yellow dress

They break your heart

Walter

Honey, why are you here?

why lie

Excuse

Wouldst credit for something
that is not yours

Just trying to close a deal

These kids are part of my being

I am a seller in addition to them
they could not meet the painter

I can not know because
You told me to stay at home

We're making money, your pocket
or mine, what is the difference?

You take so lightly

Not at all

It is no credit, you mean your
you painted? Well I do not care

For me di a monkey painted them

Well I'm glad you can talk
but without an emotional connection

I just want to share
with the world

Wish that they are gathering dust
or hanging in someone's living room?

Who is this man?

That's Dino Olivetti

He's a genius with disks
but not what you think

He does not speak any English

Hey

Good to see you

Mr, Olivetti is delighted
with paint

Want to know who
is the artist

I am what

$ 5,000

We won $ 5,000

And it was not even one
of good

Do you mean one of the YOURS?

No, no, no

Well, our, one of our

We are now hanging in the collection
Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti

With your support comes credibility

And with credibility

Comes respect

What about honesty?

Good painting says "Keane"

I am Keane

You're Keane

From now on

We are one and the same

My sources say the mayor
should expect a big surprise today

On behalf of the children of the world

I present this painting
Mayor of San Francisco

My man on the street tells me that
Soviet ambassadors in the city

Could Talk

In the interest of peace
through culture

Dono this painting people
of the Soviet Union

The Onion

9:30

Crawford Joan has a
Dinner reservations

Ms, Crawford in recognition of his
cinematic genius

We gave this painting!

The cat is out of the bag can reveal
that our local illuminator, Walter Keane

He has opened his own gallery

Rubén drown when you see this

I remember when my mom
He painted it

Segura? It has had to
long time ago

Of course I'm sure

It was in our old apartment
I was on a kitchen bench

Honey're confused

I painted it

My mother did was using
my blue dress

Many little girls have
that dress

Honey, you have a good eye

I painted it but I tried to imitate
the style of your mother

You know how used styles
to paint?

Well you did a good job

hello

Sorry, there had never
done this before

So I do not know ,,,

I was raised a Methodist, if that
a problem can go

No, no please

Do we throw people here

Ok

That worries

Okay ,,,

I lied to my daughter

Why would you do that?

My husband pushed me to do

Only he had never lied before
I'm not that kind of person

Your husband is that kind of person?

I do not think so

He likes to tell stories and
maybe you exaggerate but

He is a good man and

Just trying to save money
buy a house for the family

And the girl, this lie

It will cause damage?

Damage? Do Not

Do Not

No I ,,,

I do not ,,,

Just looking for some answers

Well, the modern world is
a complicated place

occasionally

The children should be protected from

certain truths

Do Not

Not

It seems that her husband tries to do
best of an imperfect situation

She was raised Christian, you know what I mean

The man is the head of the family

Maybe I should

Trust your judgment

I think it's scary
ugly and rookie

exact

I love him

We arrived early

Do not tell me?

Thank You

Hey sweetie

That good party

It's happening

Where is your material?

We decided that this single
would be the show of Walter

Oh

You did?

Why would you do that?

Oh because Walter is more
set

Weird, you know?

Walter does not seem the type to paint
adorable kids and hungry

It's really good to see you

Thanks future

Your husband has enough talent

Your pints too?

I do not know ,,,

Curiosity causes me your ethnic

How long will I take
paint that piece?

That?

Probably months ,,,

First I thought, sketch

Then find the time
alone with the oils

Oils?

Is not acrylic?

Ah that, if

Yes, it's like

A mixture of ideas

Spinning in my head

So where
you get your ideas?

A do you mean?

I mean

Because they are all images
of children?

Our art critic John Canaday

With a perspective on the
Walter Keane work

Keane's work is
completely without distinction

Not a member of society
Artists West

There is someone important

It is only known for his appearances in
gossip columns

Mr, Keane is why
society needs critical

To protect against such atrocities

Mom?

Mom!

I can go ?,

You can not

Mom is busy right now

What are you doing?

Hey sweetie, come

You need to respect
privacy of your mother

Sometimes adults need
time alone

Come

That's the ice cream truck?

Go for a good ice cream!

Out of this world!

I do not feel comfortable with this
I used to do it differently and now ,,,

Jane is fine, went to where the ice cream ,,,

It has new shoes even
a fund for college

maybe

Only this dizzy all
madness of the last days

I need your help

I want to go on television to
defend our art

Wait, come out on TV?

Yes but, you say?

I mean, that forces me to paint

This?

Maybe you have an obsession
with little girls

adorable

Sorry

Imagine painting them
in the corner

Yes

Perhaps the winter warmth
help me

Walter, art is personal

Which requires a grown man
to paint something?

Because I ,,,

I lived surrounded by six sisters

I grew up in an orphanage

I ,,,

I lived in a world

Where adults were gone
and the kids and kittens

They ran wild for
desolate landscape

What about your streets
why you painted?

Well, I lived, I experienced

Not only were streets and flowers?

Of course not

It was after the war

Destruction everywhere

Travel by continent

The slaughter was horrible

My mind was marked
and my art too

Nothing in my life

He has had much impact

As the sight of the children

The war destroyed

innocence

without parents

homeless

Fighting for trash

This is how my life as a painter

It started suddenly

Thenceforth

I painted

The lost kids

With big eyes

those eyes

That always have their
tantalizing quality

How many sales today?

Sales?

None with this public

These people just look,
They can not afford these paintings

But we have given many
posters

I started charging for posters

First five cents, then 10

If people are crazy

But then I started thinking

You would rather sell a painting
$ 500

Or a million posters reproduced
cheaply?

People really do not care
if a copy

They just want art that touches

And we could sell anywhere

Where!

It stinks here, should open
window

What time is it?

6:30

You have there? let me see

Walter No, it's personal

Personal? We are married

We should not hide
each other secrets

Put it up there,
put it up there

It is a style completely
different

Yes, it is

It looks like you

Well, it's ,,,

a self--portrait

I would not know how to explain it

I was thinking that

Maybe I could

Signing myself

That sounds a little confusing,
do not you think?

I mean Keane

I know

But when people ask me
if pinto

I do not know how to respond and be nice
to say, this is mine

Who told him big eyes?
-- Nobody

If you tell someone this
empire collapses

You want to return the money

We have committed fraud

I know

My God, I know

I think about it every minute
of my life

I kept half of the deal

I have not told anyone

Please

Just let me have this

I did not know you painted, Margaret

Yes, do not talk about it

Unfortunately people do not
buy female art

What about Georgia O'Keeffe?

Then Margaret, where
you get your ideas?

Well, the world around me

And I just ,,,

I love Modigliani ,,,
-- Modi what?

Modigliani

Please, it's gossip column,
cling to familiar Angulo

Check out the
little Jane here

That talent!

Look at us to Keane

When you open our veins
bleed oil

Ah a little taste

The fourth member of the
painters Keane

Lily honey, how are you?

I'm fine, Dad

I lost a tooth

Really?

You got into a fight?

No, I fell

Okay!

The tooth fairy is something
I'll deal or your mom and handled it?

She handled it

Well, well

Well, Jane

Come

Come show him the room
of the children

and then

You girls can
have a good time

Walter

You never told me that
had another daughter

I did not? clear

Lily is my first marriage

apology

Sorry, sorry

Walter

I can talk to you?

What's happening there?

That's Lily

Sure that I mentioned

No, you did not

It will move here?

Do Not

His mother go to Vegas
the weekend

I should have it opposes
once a month but

I do not set according to his mom

How could you lie with
something so big?

As it is a very sweet little girl
-- I bet it is

Well I held your daughter
and never said anything

I'll pretend you did not say that

Ok?

Sorry

Please only finish
with this

I have met many
celebrities

And only a certain type of creature
You can live in that light

Walter had that ability,
Margaret? not much

I painted this

Really?

It is very

evocative

sensual

MDH

You are very

mysterious

Yes

Do not use my name because people do not
serious female art

MDH are my initials

And

I'm interested in numerology

As you know, the 7 is a good number

Seven?

Luckily my
maiden name is

Doris Margaret Hawkins

Letter M is number 13
alphabet

D is the number four
H is the number eight

And if one has a
and three from 13

An orgy color

And some ,,,

Sunbeam, sorry

Which makes 4 + 4 + 8

Da 16 and then 1 + 6

da 7

Margaret?

just a moment

Wow, that these babbling?

Divisions?

Could you please help
the world and close your mouth?

They are only interested
in big eyes

Two nuts that fell from the same
tree is insufferable

Why go hungry while
they print money?

Because the nut is a genius

Sell paintings

And sells paintings and images
sells postcards of the images of paintings

I bet you could make a
10 minutes

Would question your sincerity

Ah, customers do not
will realize

Christ is a movement

Hello, DeeAnn

My God, I thought it was
the wrong direction

I know, is a very large entry

I can honestly nor
believe I moved here

I know

We have two acres

a pool

five rooms

I found excessive

Since only ,,,

There are three of us here

Been so long
since I've seen

I know

North Beach is 30 miles
The same would be 300

Well, probably're busy out
with all your rich friends

Please, these are friends
Walter

He brings people here

The Beach Boys came

Are you hungry?

I am thirsty

When we moved I thought
a bar was something extravagant

but

You'd be surprised that both
you can use

So Walter is?

I could not be happier

It has everything you ever dreamed

And you too

fabulous

That is your art studio?

Do you want to go there

I want to look

I want to see what it looks workplace
a successful artist

Oh no, no

DeeAnn? Please do not go there

sight

You can not go in there

Walter pint here too

Walter is at home now?

What the hell happened?

Nothing, I ,,,

I just ,,,

I invited DeeAnn by ,,,

You know I do not like anyone
see my work before finishing

How dare you call
fraud

Shut up, you're a liar, Walter

Get out of my house, my big house

Go to continue looking briefs
fisherman

Fuck

I do not want back
never invite

I will not do

Well, Jane I go to work

I can go?

No, I never can go

I should not even ask

And as you came you here?

Do not you hear
allowed visits?

This has come not?

You're the only living soul
I can tell you my secret

Okay

I painted I

I did it

All and each

All big eyes

I

And no one but you will know

And I will paint another one now

Look what I've come a girl
crazy talking to a dog

A productive day
today

I ran into a hot gossip

The Madame Chiang Kai--Shek
come to town opposite Taipei

I think we should introduce
a painting

Dick's interview

To hell with Dick

I met a new type
UPI

maybe

She would like one of your
street scenes

I know why I did not think you could make a

Trash Chinatown

With adorable and little girls

Something like a mixture of eyes
large and Chinese

Do Not

No, she is a dignitary
and she deserves

A piece that comes directly from you

You think so?

Well, maybe you're right

Probably not have a scene of paris
hung in his palace

Unless the madame and
have a S, Cenic

What did you say?
-- A S, Cenic

Is the painter who did all
your previous work

It was my nickname in Paris

To all my friends paint him
liked both my scenic view

They called me, well they could not
pronounce it properly

I called S, Cenic

The more you lie more
little you look

How dare you accuse me
lying

I am proud of my
previous work

So why paintedst
about the name?

A council never use basis
of water on a oleo

It goes fast

You sound a crazy love
God

You've seen me painting

I have not done

I always thought

He had done it but it's like
a mirage

From a distance you look like a painter

But up close there is not much there

I went to Paris

I studied there

I spent hours and hours

In the Louvre

Looking at the grandeur of the masses
-- Walter

Have you ever been to Paris?

I just wanted to ,,, become
an artist

Just never turned out well

I do not want to sleep here

There are three additional bedrooms
in this house

Go to choose one

The more of these there behind?

I do not know, maybe three thousand or so?

You can print more?
-- Excuse me Miss

How much is this painting

Go, for I pay?

If Mr, Keane

Not even one of mine,
one of hers

This does not change anything

another truth

Who cares?

Maybe it's time to shake
things

And start putting my name
MDH below

Do Not

Absolutely not, and hate me
by letting the first

Shut Up

Do not raise your voice

Oh, I will speak

As strong as you like

Do not do it or I'll kill you

What?

If you tell someone

I watch, I meet people

Remember cousin Banducci,
the seller of liquor wholesale

Are you threatening me?

All Right

Kill Me

My God, I have kept your
secret for years

And not once have I ,,,

You know how hard this
It has been for me?

I have no friends

I lied

My own daughter

Life imitates art

A king crying

Walter, do you want?

Everything with you is calculated

We are back where we had
first date

Look, do not deny it, I need you
you're the one who has the gift

Now, there is an opportunity to ,,,
Oh my God

I am excited

kids of the world

When people ask me, 'why

that all ,,,

Who wrote this shit?

Mr, Keane

This is not the way

You may want to write
a letter to the editor?

What are you afraid of?

Just because people do
like my work

That means it's bad?
-- Do Not

But neither becomes art

Art should raise not please

Particularly if you are in
classroom education

You have no idea

Why someone becomes critical?

Because you can not create

Oh go

That tone is not ,,,
-- Do not give me that

Do not know what to put your
emotions out there

Naked for all
the world to see

denominator?

Today, a worldwide celebrity

Let's give a big welcome

Margaret Keane

So it's true that your husband Walter
It is a big seller of paintings in the world?

Do Not

Big Lolo

Everything you just said

It is false

one

Walter and I are no longer married

And two

He is not a painter

But is not the one who makes the
crazy eyes?

Do Not

But if he has taken credit
that for 10 years

I am

The only painter in the family

You must be kidding

They know that bother me? Margaret le
broke the news to a big press buttons

And there is an excellent reporter
Celebrities like me

I knew it

Expected

Margaret has gone mad

You have to help

I need a story

A national story to calm things

I do not know Walter

What he said was quite explosive

It is crazy!

Not even make sense

While I was studying art in Paris

She was a girl in Tennessee

sight

My early drafts

Orphans Berlin 1949

Margaret Why would he do that?

You are sick in the head

He left me to go to the jungle

He went with religious fanatics

Witnesses Muhammad

Really do not know much about them

No celebrate Christmas

They can not salute the flag
do not let Jane go to the prom

It makes me look crazy

He says I copy it,
he taught me how to paint

Using a projector to trace my
work and fill colors

And how much of that is not true?

all

I feel good about myself

For the first time in years and I can not
Walter let me remove it

And what if it demands?

$ 17 million

The art world is altered

Today the lawyers present their
opening arguments

For Margaret Keane
against Walter Keane

And what according to the newspapers

Be the case that could produce more
riots in Hawaiian history

Mr, Keane

Is not worried about the charges?

I am very upset

But luckily I have to this company
news to look after my back

Hope all this trial is
removed by noon

My only concern is

Have someone psychiatric help
this woman

the need
-- Well, sorry gentlemen

Excuse me please

Margaret Keane is a figure
published

Wherefore must prove that the
statements of our newspapers

They are aware of probable falsity

Now there is no evidence to suggest that
our editors knew that these

Assertions were not true

We would like to introduce 692 items
in which

The Ms, Keane

Credited Mr, Keane

As the painter called
'' kids with big eyes "

Few years ago these back?

The Ms, Keane has made these
statements

since 1958

This is a very strange case

These paintings hang in museums
all over the world

Accredited Mr, Keane

And true import

The Ms, Keane has contributed immensely
to confusion

It seems impossible that such shares become
the standard level for liability

So the charge against
is removed

Thank you Your Honor

Good luck Keane

Good luck?
Where do they go?

We were accused of responsibility

To you I was accused of slander

Mr, Keane?

Seems to have no advice

Would you like a moment to
order their affairs?

I've always careful to myself

I do not need a group of suits
hire to defend my good name

Proceed!

I was worried about my
old friend Walter Keane

The Hawaiian heat may have
cooked his brain

All he knows cuts
and lawyers

It comes from Perry Mason on TV

I am the sole creator of my art

This is my life

My contribution to the world

Mr, Keane

I told you should ask
question witnesses

If you act as your own lawyer

You can not make statements
at this time

If, fine

It is difficult to keep everything
this in order

Ms, Keane

As expected someone to swallow
his fantastic story?

Mr, Keane

Ms, Keane

Seems to be a lucia

And reasonably intelligent
woman

So as you can possibly

Having come so far with a
farce like that?

I was forced to it

You do tapeworms

I had dominated the

He was going crazy but you
was what I wanted

I was afraid and

He saw no other option
so I followed the game

I can remind you that this
under oath?

Just give me

I allowed

Take credit for big eyes

They were a reflection of my feelings

And showed in the boy

But I was weak

No I thought I could leave
and maintaining

For myself and my daughter

And he said

Nobody would support payments without
personality

Maybe he was right

You eras

very talented

To be charming

And you're a genius in sales
and promotion

It seems that described two
different men

One is a sadistic ogre
and the other

A lovely gentleman

That is you Walter

You Jekyll Hyde

That is a blatant statement

I demand that the deleted
log

denied

Now, you were cheeky

Criticabas me constantly,
me you desgastabas

Saying you'd kill me
if he told the truth

Well, now I do

your Honor

I ask for a mistrial

You're a liar
do not even know what the truth

This is not a domestic problem

Perhaps it is

But the rest of us have
interest in seeing as resolved

I regret my excitement

I am an artist

maybe

your Honor

I call as my witness

Mr, Walter Stanley Keane

Swear to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth?

Yes
-- May God help you

Yes

Mr, Keane

There seems to be many hints

And conflicting testimony

On the genesis of big eyes

you mind

Clarify this short

Who gave life to these paintings?

Well I created these children

The choreography is not necessary,
just sit and testify

I had a wonderful life

He was an artist

And a friend of many
celebrities

however

When I remember everything

To define that really mattered

It was dedicated to the
kids hungry world

It all started in

Berlin

After World War II

orphans

They were chewing a bare wire

their bodies

lacerated

His fingers wrinkled

Her big eyes

The Ms, Joan Crawford

Made ,,
-- Mr, Keane!

sit

Marilyn Monroe

I will not lie ,,,

Jerry Louis calls me and tells me want
I paint it to me and my family

Miss, Natalie Wood

I was approached

And he said

This is the best painting I've
seen in my life!

It ended

I have not finished

In fact if

I can not stand one more story

It is not testifying,
He is wandering

The court records are already quite
full no nonsense stories

We can stay here until
die of old age but

It is obvious that this case is summarized his
word against that of Ms, Keane

Mistrial?

Do Not! Not a mistrial!

In my opinion

There is only one way to clarify this

Both paint

Well bring them over here and put
on both sides of the bench

Now, I do not seek a masterpiece

I do not know much about these things

I am a lawyer not a critical
art

But an hour is enough?

If Your Honor

Ok then

Both have the same supplies

So without further ado

Ms, Keane, Mr, Keane

The court is yours

Mr, Keane?

I just put the environment

I hope the muse arrives

Well his muse has 58 minutes

Mr, Keane, right?

My old shoulder injury
I just go on, have a ,,,

that muscle

I have been taking drugs

Inflammation

Do not think I can
painting today

The jury found in favor of
Margaret Keane at all points

Charges of defamation

emotional stress

And I hurt your reputation

Thank you, thank you very much

Margaret, as you call
painting?

Show 224

Margaret, you could give me
your autograph?

Two things he cared to Margaret,
his daughter and his paintings

And after all the crazy twists
his life took

He loved the final

for both

Walter never accepted defeat, he insisted
who was the true artist

For the rest of his life, died
in 2000, bitter and penniless

Never produced another painting

Margaret found personal happiness
and remarried

After many years in Hawaii, moved
San Francisco and opened a new gallery

She still paints every day
