Hey, squirrelly, huh, sis?

Hyah!
Yeah, just a little bit.

Hey. Whoa!

Whoa, whoa. Hey, down.

Ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ho.

Hey, keep calm. I got you,

Rosa?

How are you doing?

Okay, more or less.

Just remember it's
1 kg for 2.2 lbs.

Okay?

I'm here for anything you need.

Right?
Right.

Darius.
How's she doing?

You know, second week
in the country.

The girl's terrified.

She lucky she got you
to walk her through this.

She is, and you're lucky
you have me to run this place.

I know I am.

The Purge doesn't
release anger.

It increases anger.
It's a virus.

It's an American-born virus
of hate and rage,

and it's injected
with a bullet,

and it's spreading,
it's growing, it's mutating.

Turn that off, Adela. Please.

(over TV):
The Purge is coming.

(speaks Spanish)

(chuckles softly)

Mmm.

Mm-hmm.

(Juan chuckles, speaks Spanish)

(Adela chuckles)

This...

reminds me
of your mother's house.

(Juan speaks Spanish)

You should give it to Darius
so he can make real Mexican food.

Not those terrible burritos.

Juan, please, where are we?

You need to practice
your English.

When in Rome.

When in America.

Just do it for me.

Please.

The Tucker family would really
appreciate that, believe me.

DALTON:
Now that your wife is pregnant,

if you want any extra help,
you're welcome to come by.

We could all
lock down together.

Oh, I hate the damn Purge.

It's hard to be social
on that night.

But thank you for the invite.
Anytime.

Baby, that smells so good.
Mm.

I'm going to the kitchen.
Y'all need anything?

You want another beer?

Yeah, yeah, I'll take one.
Another beer.

Thank you.
Thank you, honey.

(laughter, chatter)

CASSIE:
I don't know. I just feel like

a goddamn Hoover these days.

Everything in my line of sight
just gets consumed.

Even things I hate.


You know, Anna's been
cooking for us

the most amazing Mexican food,
am I right?

DALTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
It's so good but so fattening.

(Anna and kids
conversing in Spanish)

I put on five pounds.
CASSIE: No, you have not.

(chuckles)
EMILY: Mm-hmm.

You know...

Anna has a sister.

Also a nanny.

You should meet her.
Yeah, we're all right.

What, baby?

to meet her sister.

We're fine.

Thank you, though.

Baby, Emily's just trying to be
nice and help out, right?

So you're being
a little bit rude.

Oh, was I?


My apologies, Emily.

Oh, it's fine.

It's just it's really hard
to find good help,

and Anna's sister's a sweetheart.
CASSIE: Yeah.

We don't need to meet
Anna's sister, Emily.

I don't even know
if I want our kids

speaking Spanish in this house.

Now, thank you for the offer,
but, no, thank you.

Okay, then.

(dog barking in distance)

Hey, Juan.

Kirk tells me that
you were late this morning.

I'm never late, sir.


You're never late?

Hey, Kirk, Juan here
says you're lying.

Juan's a free man.
He can say whatever he wants.

You know, Juan,
you show up late again,

I'm gonna have to fire you.
That's the rules.

Yes, sir.

DYLAN: Hey, you know
what somebody else told me?

That he found your lariat
just laying

in the front of the stable
on the ground.

Is that true?

No, sir.

It's called "La Riata."

(muttering quietly in Spanish)

T.T., your Purge
protection bonus.

Thank you, Mr. Tucker.
Stay safe.

Thank you, sir.

Kirk.

(speaking Spanish)

You're doing a good job, Juan.

My son's a hair rattled
'cause of yesterday.

Don't take offense.

Thank you, sir.

I really appreciate that.

Can I be honest, Mr. Tucker?

Please do.

Your son doesn't like me
because...

I'm Mexican.

And I think Dylan believes

a cowboy shouldn't be
from <i>MÃ©xico</i> or...

Argentina
or from somewhere else.

I know that a lot of people
feel that way,

but I'm not sure
that's the case with Dylan.

Uh, he's a very proud man.
You one-upped him yesterday.

You're a damn fine cowboy,
Juan.

I don't know, sir.

Well...

I don't know either.

I just...

I always taught my son
to be a proud American,

but maybe I didn't really
teach him what that meant.

I don't even know if I know
what that means anymore,

proud American.

World's changing all around us.

At each other's throats.

Confusing times.

I want to give you...

...the goddamn
Purge protection bonus.

Stay safe.

Thank you.

â™ª â™ª

That money's nothing
but a way for these people

to keep us alive so they can
continue using our slave labor.

We're nothing more than that.

I know what I'm-a use
my money for, though,

and it's not for protection.

(clicks tongue)

Crazy man.

See, my people have been

This reminds me of home, Adela.

You know what I mean.

Maybe you're right.

Maybe we have to forget
where we came from.

And accept where we are.

When in America.

Like you said.

No, that's not what I meant.

What did you mean, then?

That America is everything.


What the hell are
you talking about, Adela?

America is <i>MÃ©xico.</i>

America is Africa.
America is Italia.

We can take it all,
we can learn it all,

and we can embrace it.

You really believe that?

I spent your money well.

Today's your day

You become me

The old switcheroo is happening

You and all your rich-ass
neighbors will find out

what it's like to be
penniless and powerless.

To be like us!

These rich motherfuckers
can't hide

behind their steel walls
no more.

This is the way
things are now, boys!

This Purge is forever!

This is the real Purge.

The eternal Purge.

Ever After!

MEN:
Ever After!

Run.

T.T.:
<i>Ay, cabrÃ³n.</i>

(grunting)
I'm gonna give you a chance

to save your family,
Dylan Tucker,

one by one,
but you'll have to pay.

(grunts)
Let's start with

eeny, meeny,

miny, ho!
(Harper gasps)

How much would you give
for her, Dylan?

How much would you give to
stop me from putting a bullet

in your baby sister's head?

Let's say ten bucks,
and she lives.

Oh, that seems like
a fair market price

for this broke-down,
useless woman.

Let's see
how much money you got.

Aw, shit, Dylan! I forgot.

You're me now,
which means you're broke.

You have no money.
That sucks, doesn't it?

See, Dylan, without money,

you have no power.

Without money, you can't save
your own little sister,

and she will die because of it.
(grunting, panting)

But how's that feel?

How's that feel, Dylan?

Feels like shit, doesn't it?
(Harper whimpers)

That's my life.

It's our life.

That's how we feel.

That's how we have felt

every day
since the day we were born!

And I want you to fucking feel
that fucking pain

in your fucking stomach, Dylan!
(muffled shouting)

Goddamn it,
it looks like the old man's

got something to say! What?!

Damn it! You're right, Kirk!
You're right!

You're right!
I don't give a fuck if you think I'm right!

You're talking about
life in America,

the way the rich get rich
off the backs of the poor,

the way it's been
ever since we robbed this land

from the Native Americans.

But you got no right

to complain about the
very system you're supporting

by picking up that gun

and sanctioning
the goddamn Purge...

We need more guns.

CALEB:
...which is all about money.

You know who created
the Purge, don't ya?

A bunch of fat, rich
businessmen in Washington, D.C.

So what would
that make you, Kirk?

What would it make you?

Huh? That would make you
their lackey

and a goddamn hypocrite.

They expect you to go out there
and do their violence,

so they can play more golf.

They've never even been
in a fistfight.

You take the guys on the left,
and I'll take the right.

So...

from my family to you,

go fuck yourself.

A little busier than last year, huh?
Yeah.

MAN:
I shouldn't even be here.

I did nothing wrong.

There's no such thing
as crime anymore.

(gunfire and shouting
in distance)

Let me fucking go!

Would you shut the fuck up?

Make me.


What's going on, Darius?

I don't know.

(rapid gunfire)
(people screaming, shouting)

Adela.

Call me back, please!

No luck?

DYLAN: All right,
let me check the radio.

Maybe there's some news.

NEWSMAN:
People are still purging

all across the country.

"Ever After Purge" is popping
up all over social media,

continuous purging dubbed
the "Forever Purge."

Where the hell are we gonna go?

We'll find somewhere safe.

First we help Juan
find his wife,

then we find somewhere safe.
(phone ringing)

NEWSMAN:
Stay inside your homes.

(Rosa speaking frantically)
Rosa?

What happened?

A police van?

Why the...

Take care of yourself, Rosa.

<i>Gracias.</i>

NEWSMAN: ...they will take
action to stop it.

But still, no one knows...
I know where she is.

...who defined this movement.

(siren wailing)
(tires squealing)

WOMAN:
Ever After. Ever After.

This is the first...

real... Purge.



It's never gonna stop.

(woman continues giggling)

Let me fucking go!

â™ª â™ª

Shit.

It's blocked.

Hold on.

The station is
just a few blocks away.

I hope she'll be there.

We can walk from here.

(air brakes hiss)

You go get your wife.

We'll stay here
and protect the truck.

But you move fast.
It's not safe here.

You don't need to wait for us.

Yes, we do.

I'm coming with you.

You don't have to do that.

No, you don't have to do that.

Yeah, I do.

They saved our lives.

We'll be right here. Now go.

Come on.

(gunfire continues faintly
in distance)

T.T.:

Come on, guys.

This side.

Listen to that rhythm.

That is a Glock.

(gunfire continues)

Listen to that bass.
(gun racks)

Double-barrel shotgun.

(rapid gunfire)

AK-47.

(imitates rapid gunfire,
chuckles)

Homegrown music from
the heartland right there.


That is American music,
motherfucker.

(gunfire continues)

(imitates gunfire)

(siren wailing)
MAN: Damn!

(tires squealing)
Oh!

Strike up the band!

The symphony sings!

DEPUTY:
Hold on! We're under attack!


(tires squealing)
Dispatch!

We're outside the precinct!
Request backup!

Boom, boom, boom!

(metallic creaking)

(man grunts)
(Adela screams)

(gunfire continues faintly
in distance)

What?

Okay.

Honey...

I need you to take this.

Don't ask any questions,
not right now.

I'm gonna get out the car.
I need you to lock the door.

Okay.
I'll be right back.

The truck is coming!

It's Dylan!

Truck! Get in the truck!
(shouts in Spanish)

Get in!
The truck! Come in!

Come on, boss.
No! Find safety now!

I need to get to my family.

<i>Â¡Adela!</i> (shouts in Spanish)
We'll help you.

I'll move faster on my own.
I'll be fine. Just go.

JUAN: Go, go, go, go!
Come on!

Adela, get on!

Here.

You saved my life.

Thank you, Darius.
Okay.

JUAN:

Okay, let's grab
everything we can.

T.T.:
Peanut butter?

You found the jelly.

This could work.

NEWSWOMAN (over TV):
As the violence escalates

across the country,

we are still trying
to get more information.

NEWSMAN:
That's right, Ruth.

And we are still trying
to figure out

if this Forever Purge was
coordinated or spontaneous.

Various hashtags...
#TooMuchHate,

#OneDayNotEnough...

are all over the Internet.

Fringe conspiracy groups
supporting the Forever Purge

are calling for
a new America to emerge from...

Adela.

I'm scared to have my baby
in this world.

NEWSMAN: Freedom to hate.
Freedom to purge.

Freedom to die.

The NFFA has advised
that anyone

displaying the Ever After flag
will be arrested immediately.

We're in this together.

(news theme plays)
Breaking news.

We've just gotten word
that the NFFA

has declared martial law
across the country.

U.S. military will be sent
into nearly every city

to stop the violence
and restore peace.

Citizens are being told
to relinq...

JUAN:
<i>Â¿Bueno?</i>

<i>Â¡Bueno!</i>

(groans softly)

(muttering in Spanish)


(speaking Spanish)

Wait. Juan, I can't understand
what you're saying.

Come on. The-the cell things.

The-the... (speaks Spanish)

Towers?
Yeah, the towers.

The-the cell towers.
They are cutting them.

Hey. We just watched that
a lot of cities have gone dark.

Miami's gone.

Austin is under siege.

First responders
are overwhelmed.

We're in a state of emergency.

It's all over the country.

The violence is spreading
and not stopping.

So there's nowhere safe to go.

There's no way to get help.

(Spanish newscast continues
quietly over radio)

HARPER:
There's that symbol again.

This was planned.

I got a map.

I got ammo.

(speaks Spanish)

What?
Turn it up!

Give it to me.
(radio volume increases)

(Spanish newscast continues)

All right.
Well, we need to make a move.

They're gonna be
coming here for gas.

Hey. We got news, guys.
CASSIE: What is it?

NEWSMAN:
I repeat, your safety...

T.T.: Take this.
...cannot be guaranteed.

T.T.:
All right. Listen up.

NEWSMAN:
Due to the waves of violence

currently sweeping the U.S.,

Mexican President
LeÃ³n GarcÃ­a Soler

and Canadian Prime Minister
Sophie Poueche

are opening their borders
for the next six hours.

Mexico and Canada will take in
anyone from America unarmed

and give them sanctuary

until order is reestablished
in the U.S.

Both countries will then
close down their borders again

in six hours.

Once again, after six hours,

both borders will be
closing indefinitely.

There are reports of violence

from all corners
of the United States.

We got to go to Mexico.

NEWSMAN: Other countries
all over the world stand by

in amazement at
what's happening in the U.S.

To recap, Canadian and...

Let's go to Mexico.

â™ª â™ª

Let's go.

We don't have a choice.

NEWSMAN: <i>Authorities are
urging everyone to get</i>

<i>to the closest border
as soon as possible.</i>

NEWSMAN 2: <i>With only three
and a half hours remaining,</i>

<i>thousands of troops
have been gathered...</i>

NEWSWOMAN:
<i>Entries to Mexico and Canada</i>

<i>are already overwhelmed.</i>

NEWSMAN 3:
<i>Listeners, do not delay,</i>

<i>and get out while you can.</i>

We will be ending
our broadcast here.

Good luck, America.

Stay safe.

(static crackling)
(muffled radio chatter)

You don't like me,
do you, Dylan?

You don't like Mexicans.

What are you
talking about, Juan?

Come on, be honest.

Let's, uh...
How do you say this?

Uh, slice the shit?

Cut the shit?

Cut the shit. Yeah.

You want to cut the shit?

I want to cut
the shit with you.

All right, I'll cut the shit
with you, Juan.

I got no problem with Mexicans.

But I will say I don't
understand your culture

just like you don't
understand mine.

God's honest truth...
I don't think white people

are any better or worse
than anybody else.

But this I do believe.

We should all just
stick with our own.

Just leave each other alone.

You might be right.

But we are together now.

The hell is that?

Okay, everybody, wake up.

Wake up! Be alert!
(rapid gunfire)

(people whooping)

Oh, shit.

DYLAN: Jesus Christ.
(tires squealing)

Ever After?

(motorcycle engines revving)

Holy shit.

DYLAN:
Okay, they're coming up on us.

(gasps)
(bullets ricocheting)

DYLAN: Holy shit.
They're shooting at us.

(motorcycle engines zooming)

Shit. They're slowing us down.

Pull over!
How many are there?

(Juan speaking Spanish)

There are two on this side.
DYLAN: You stay down.

Just keep driving.

MAN:
Stop this truck! Now!

DYLAN:
Stay down. Everyone stay down.

MAN:
Stop this truck!

I'm just gonna run him over.
CASSIE: No, baby.

No, baby, wait.
HARPER: Wait. Wait.

Don't. I got an idea.
DYLAN: What?

ADELA: Don't do it.
There's too many of them.

HARPER:
Juan, get away from the window.

DYLAN:
Stay away from the window.

HARPER:
Ever After, motherfuckers!

Pull that fucking truck over!

(motorcycle engines revving)

HARPER:
Ever After!

She's one of us!

Purge Ever After!

They're going away.

There's two of us and two of them.

That right there is

What do you want to do

Why don't we give
our fellow Americans here

to redeem themselves?

MOTHER HARDIN:
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

Mm, let me explain.

You kill the brownies,

T.T.?

What happened?

NEWSWOMAN (over TV):
We have breaking news now.

This is just coming in.
We have been notified

that there has been
an attack in El Paso

at a U.S. Army military base.

As a result,
the NFFA is pulling all

military troops out of El Paso.

Again, the military is
retreating out of El Paso

after suffering massive losses

in their battle
against purgers,

including an attack
on a U.S. Army base.

NEWSMAN: And now
I'm hearing that in response

to the Army's withdrawal,
Mexico will now be closing

their El Paso border
crossing point immediately.

Again, the El Paso border point
will no longer be open

to United States citizens
fleeing the Forever Purge.

Americans left behind
at the now closed border wall

are being slaughtered
by purgers. It is a war.

El Paso has fallen
to Ever After purgers

who are going door-to-door
hunting down anyone

who is not a part
of their hate group.

ANNOUNCER:
The border is now closed.

(announcement repeats
in Spanish)

(siren blaring)
(low murmuring)

NEWSMAN:
At this point, already,

you can feel there's
a change in the air...

This city's gonna get
even worse.

<i>Ven.</i> Come.

Get out the back.

Find Chiago.

Move fast.
Tell him to meet us

in the corner of, uh,
Amboy and Highland.

Tell him,
if he doesn't do this,

many good people will die,
including me. Okay?

Yes, boss.

Okay, let's go! Follow me.

I know a way to safety.
Come on! Come on!

I need you to stand up
and walk with us, okay?

Okay. I can do it.
Can you do that?

Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, baby. Come on. - Okay.

This city is now occupied by

Our duty is to uphold
American beliefs and values

while keeping America
pure and free

from refugees and terrorists.

We have taken back
what is lawfully ours,

and we will now embark

on purification of our nation,

Only full-blooded Americans

All invaders will be purged.

We've found 'em.
Where?

They're headed for the border
through the reservation.

Follow 'em. Don't lose 'em.

I'll catch up.

â™ª â™ª

How are you getting us across?

My tribe has lived
right on the border

of the U.S. and Mexico
for centuries.

We were the only people
who could legally cross.

Then the wall split us.

But there are parts of
the terrain <i>los pendejos</i>

can't build the wall on.

Too dangerous.

And we use it to make passage.

We'll take you through.

Some of you deserve
another chance.

Are you in labor?

Mm.

DYLAN: Cassie, we got
to get you to Mexico.

I know it's bad timing, baby.

You'll be okay.

There'll be help
when we get across.

Camps have been set up, okay?

Thank you.

Let's move! Fast!
MAN: Come on, let's go!

XAVIER:
Follow me!

I will guide you!

(chatter continues)
<i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

They're getting close.

XAVIER: Follow me.
We need to move.

Hey, honey?
Yeah?

You go let these people get you
across the border, okay?

Baby, where are you going?
Yeah, you go ahead.

I love you.
I'll be right behind you.

Baby, you have to go with me.
Go on.

Don't leave me.
Go. I have to stop them.

No, baby. You cannot leave me.
You just focus on the baby.

Okay?
Cassie, I'll protect you.

Thank you, sister.
Yeah.

DYLAN:
You got her?

We'll see you over there,
all right?

Get her to the medics
in Mexico.

Get 'em
across the border safely!

(Cassie panting)
MAN: <i>RÃ¡pido.</i>

HARPER:
That's it. On here.

Sit on it.
(groaning)

Put your knees underneath it.

DYLAN:
Yeah, I'm low on ammo.

You guys got ammo?
CHIAGO: We have a few guns,

but when the bullets run dry,
draw them in close, use blades.

ADELA:
Give me a magazine.

CHIAGO:
It's the last round of ammo.

Make it count.

We'll help you.
But it's not your fight.

We've been fighting this fight
for 500 years.

Take what you need.

â™ª â™ª

(engines revving)

This is our last stand.

On my ready!

Let 'em get close!

Wait for 'em!

Wait for it!

(engines roaring)

â™ª â™ª

(arrow whistles)

(groans)
Are you okay?

(explosions booming
in distance)

Help her.
MAN: Take my hand.

Now!


Go. Go, go, go.

<i>Â¡A chingar a su madre,
cabrones!</i>

Take cover! Now!

(gun clicking empty)

(grunting)
I'm out!

(gun clicks empty)
(groans)

CHIAGO: Go!
DYLAN: Come on.

Damn it.

I'm out!

Yeah, I'm out, too.
I have one left.

(gunfire continues)

Come on, motherfucker!

(gunfire stops)

Fuck.

Hunt 'em down and kill 'em all.

Save that Mexican
son of a bitch for me.

(others murmuring)
Purge and purify, Ever After!

OTHERS:
Ever After!

â™ª â™ª

(doors creak)




(indistinct chatter)

They're coming.

Good.

We slow them down.

Give our people more time
to get across safely.

You guys stay in here.
We'll cover the back room.

â™ª â™ª

(panting softly)

(engines revving in distance)

I love you.

I love you.

(engine revving)

(engines revving)

(chimes jingling softly)

ELIJAH (outside):
We got this handled here.

Rest of you go stop 'em
from crossing the border.

MAN: On it.
MAN: Got it.

Let's go.

â™ª â™ª

We're gaining on 'em.
They can't be far.

JUAN:

Adela, wake up.

MAN:
There he is. Grab him!

(Elijah yells)
(Adela screams)

Adela!

(both grunting)

Fucking whore!



â™ª â™ª



(gun firing)
(Adela gasps)

Call your people
and tell 'em you need help.



(man groaning)

Call out now!

(gun firing)


Kill this fucking pig!
Fucking English!

Kill this pig!


(Adela shouts in Spanish
in distance)

ELIJAH: Translate!
What are you saying?!

(Adela groans)

I said speak English!

Translate!
(Adela shouting in Spanish)

Kill him!
Speak fucking English!

Kill him!

I'll do it!

Speak English!

I will cut your throat!

Speak...


(Adela speaks Spanish)

DYLAN:
I got him.


Does this translate?

<i>Pendejo.</i>

(gunshot echoing)

(Dylan panting)

â™ª â™ª

Are you okay, my love?

(both sigh)

(kicks body)

â™ª â™ª

You made it.

You just crossed into <i>MÃ©xico.</i>

She'll be there.

â™ª â™ª

<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>

Thank you.
We owe you our lives.

Hospital?
(busy chatter)

Hospital? <i>Â¿MÃ©dico?</i>

<i>SÃ­.</i>

Look who's here.

Oh, my God.

Hi.

It's a girl.
It's a girl?

You want to hold your daughter?

Can I?
Please.

Hey.

Hi.
(laughs): Hey.

Thank you.
Congratulations.

Thank you.

Congratulations, Dad.

<i>Gracias, Juan.</i>
