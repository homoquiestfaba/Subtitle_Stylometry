Son, will you turn off that wretched puppet?

Brush your teeth.

-No, * a puppet.$
-Beg your pardon?

He's not a puppet. Howdy-Doody is real.

-He's real!
-No, it's a dee-dee-doo-doo.

-You have to say good night.
-Ohhh!

And remember, you have to be asleep, when he comes down the chimney.

It's not even a chimney, Pop.

Oh, he has his ways.

-Then I'll wait up, watch him do it!
-Nonsense!

-OK, I wanna a story then.
-No, no, no, no stories tonight.

Just one. And then I'll go to bed, right away!

And then I'll brush my teeth, I promise!

It is said that at the dawn of time...

...man, beast and all the magic beings lived together under the Aislin ...

...the father tree.

But man has been created with a hole in his heart.

A hole, that no possession, power or knowledge could fill.

And in his infinite greed, man dreamt of expanding his dominion over the entire earth.

The blood of many an elf, ogre and goblin was split in that wall with man.

And King Balor, the one armed king of Elfland, watched the slaughter in dread and despair.

But one day, the master of the goblin blacksmith offered to build the king a golden mechanical army...

70 times 70 soldiers that would never know hunger and could not be stopped.

Prince Nuada begged his father to agree.

"Build me this army." the King said.

So a magical crown was forged...

...that would allow those royal blood to command the golden army if unchallenged.

I'm the king Balor, leader of the golden army...

Is there anyone who disputes my right?

-In his throne room, no one challenged his word.
-Wait...

What if someone challenge him, they'll have a fight?

Most likely, a challenge must be answered.

-But do you want to hear the end of this story or not?
-Yes, please.

So, the world was changed.

And the next time the humans marched, they felt the earth tremble beneath their feet.

...and saw the sky darken with monstrous shapes.

The golden army had no remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.

And King Balor's heart grew heavy with regret.

So he called a truce and divided the crown in three pieces...

One of the humans and two for himself.

In exchange, man would keep to the cities, and magical beings would own the forests.

This truce will be honored by their sons, and sons of their sons, until the end of the time.

But Prince Nuada did not believe in the promises of man...

And it is said that he went into exile, vowing to return the day his people needed him most.

So the golden army laid dominate, locked inside the earth...

...waiting...

And there it is. to this day, waiting the day the crown is made whole again...

...silent, still, and indestructible.

-What does it mean industible?
-In-des-truct-i-ble.

It means no one can destroy that. Go to sleep, my son.

But it is just a story, right Pops?

-Is it now?
-Yeah. Come on, those guys, they can't be real.

My son... I'm sure you'll find out.

How long have you been there, my friend?

They are over there.

I bought them today. I haven't fed them... at all.

I'll go up first, you'll follow. And remember, Mr Wink...

...don't be shy.

Next mot, No. 776, is an important * figure...

...a fertility goddess, dated approximately 15.000 to 10.000 BC .

This was founded in a less deposit * in a terrace about 30 meters from Shannon River

And we'll open the biding at $300.000.

Sold.

And now we move up to the our item. No.777 ..

A piece from the Royal crown of Bethmora...

...*origin speaks saga of sons of heaven and hold the fate of golden army.

And here it is... our next item.

Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your seats.

The auction will restart shortly. I'm sure it's just a temporary lost of power.

Now for the first time at auction, a piece of royal crown of Bethmora...

-...coming to us from a long lost culture.
-Lost?

Not at all.

Forgotten by you perhaps.

Very, very much alive.

Who are you Sir? Sir! Please identify yourself.

-You can not just..
-I am Prince Nuada, Silverlance, son of King Balor.

And I'm here, Sir...

...to reclaim what is rightfully mine.

Security! Call security!

What do you think you doing? It is outrageous!

Take what you want. Please, Please! Anything, anything!

Be quiet.

Sit~ down~!

Proud, empty hole, things you are!

Let this remind you why you once feared the dark...

*This is it. We have to talk.

Undercover. Can't get the meaning of the word?

Look, we're still government founder, we are still a secret... Although a dirty secret if you ask me.

Officially, we DO NOT exist.

You see, that's the problem, when we get these...

Subway, highway.

Ahh, Park.

And he posed for this one, and gave him autograph.

I suppress each photo, cellphone video. They cost me a fortune... And they showed on Youtube.

God, I hate Youtube.

He just wants the world outside to know what we do, what he does.

-He loathes me.
-I don't think so.

-Target practice.
-Oh, dear.

And then he posts them around.

You know how that make me feel?

-What's going on?
-Oh, it's Friday.

I tell you, Fish. He hates me. He's out to destroy me. My street creed is low.

-Street creed.
-My mojo.

Washington, they got wondering if I got this stuck.*

Do you think I have an easy job? Do you think I...I enjoy?

Being a pain... in a neck? I... I am...

I am medicated.

This is not a candy. it's an anti-acid. Yes it's over the counter of medicine.

This, this is medicine. You see...

I'm worried because I mean... I am, we are...

After all, We are just humble servants.

-It's not about you. He's acting out. Things are a little tense with Liz.
-Tense?

How tense? Tense how?

You know, the usual. New couple make new justments.

-They argue. Sometimes, like everybody else.

They have good days, and bad days.

-Abe.
-Come Back here!

Manning.

Watch it, Boys. She's on fire.

Then again there're the really bad days.

-I'm not afraid of you, you know.
-Oh you should be, look at this mess. Look around!

I have one rule. Don't touch my stuff.

-Oh, I get it. That's your rule.
-One only.

Calm, easy.

How's that even possible everything you should stuff. *

The same CD, LP...

Al Green. You can't listen to Al Green on CD!

An a trick? And a track?

One day the world gonna realize the mistake. A track was the way to go.

Come, kids, you can come out now. That's right, it's all over.

What about me, Red? I need some space.

Please, enough. Find my tooth brush.

Tooth brush? Wait a minute.

It's right there!

Red, I can't live like this.

Oh, Damn. Gotta go. We all gotta go. It's an emergency, right?

-Let's go.
-Red!

Hold on a second.

Manning. Watch yourself, Liz.

-Listen.
-Manning.

-We're going to downtown Manhattan.
-It will be fun.

Downtown, very dangerous. Dangerous for you and me.

I know that you dream with the outside world. But trust me, it's not that great. The savages that madder* are bad.

These... on the other hand... are good. Cuban.

-Being seen...
-Bad.

I compensated these boxes. I'll give you some more. But...

You got to do me a little favor, out there tonight.

-You have to be very, very....
-Discreet.

-Thank you.
-No welcome.

Invisible. In and out.

Really?

Hey, I can be discreet if I wanna be.

-I followed you and Maiers, didn't I?
-And then he got transfered to Arctica.*

-Discreet!
-He said he liked the city of cold.

Like a shadow

Like a shadow in the night.

We discovered a few illegally Imported items. it's minus infraction... A gas pocket... maybe detected a gas pocket...*

Ok, now FBI agents under my commands are going up there right now, with special gas equipment.

Geez, it stinks in here. It's worse than my room.

-Say Cheese~!
-Let's go.

If they called us for. It's over.

It's over 70 guests reported.

-We have no survivors, no bodies.
-Same story here, babe.

Don't call me babe.

"Abe"! I said "Abe"!

Wrong Channel!

Abe, I think Liz is still mad at me.

-Still the same channel.
-Oh.

-Can I ask you a question?
-No.

-Listen, when we get home later, I'm gonna clean up the whole mess.
-That's not the problem.

-What is it?
-Not now.

Abe, what do we got?

Oh, this is Interesting. Both boxes have the royal seal.

...only delivered at time... of war.

Red? We have a company.

Come on, come on, give me some to work with here.

-Borrowing creatures.
-How many?

Many. There are no corpses, because there're no leftovers.

Do you notice the floor?

Crap!

-Precisely. All these things do is eat and eat, then poo, and then eating again.
-Remind you anyone?

-Abe, What are these things?
-Carcharodon Calcarea.

-English! English!
-They're tooth fairies.

-Ha!
-No, no, 3rd century, Black Forest, feed mostly on mainly calcium,

...bone, skin, organs. But they do go for the teeth first, ha, hence the name "tooth fairies".

I bet you they don't leave money, either.

Oh my God!

-Liz... You're pregnant!
-No, I'm not.

Yes. You are.

What do you got, Marble?

I may have found one.

It's kind of cute.

Don't go nearer.

Red! We need you here!

Nasty little...

Keep firing Abe! Keep firing!

Damn!

Sorry, Lady.

You should be running.

There's a safer upstairs, come to get there!

We need hurry!

Up to the safe! Now!

Abe! Up the stairs!

Come on Liz, burn them all.

In the safe! In the safe!

Fire is mine!

Fire is in me.

Red! Stay away from the window!

World~ here I come!

What have you done!

Guess we're up.

Hey! Hellboy, over here!

Your royal highness!

/Welcome Prince Nuada.../

/...we honor your return./

Before entering the council chamber, you must...

-...surrender your weapons.
-I will NOT.

It is protocol, Sir...

...peasant and prince are same...*

/It will be a pleasure to do away with you./

/Please, Brother./

/...give it to me./

For you, Sister...

...anything.

According to multiple eye witnesses, lives were in fact in danger.

There you have it...Hellboy. But is he really on our side?

-Right Red?
-Yeah, But I'm really wanna be ordinary person, just like you, and you.

Hey! Guy, you're missing this!

We are on TV!

Liz! Are you all right?

Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.

You don't need to do that. You can trust me. My readings are quite accurately.

Shut up, Abe!

Get your damn hand away from the door!

Nothing to fear. Despite the appearances, I bet Red can be excellent father figure.

-And what about, what about this guy...walking with a toilet seat on his head.
-Toilet seat!

It's quite obvious! It's a breathing apparatus!!!

Abe, I think we got lose of this truck. It sends out the wrong signal.

That's our problem? Transportation.

And this girl, with * fire, what's wrong with her.

She's cute. She can be on the show.

I hate it, when people stare at me. Makes me feel like a freak.

You had no right, Red.

Oh, Manning! Could you...

And gas is phenomena, that it can occur...*

You murdered me. You murdered me.

You have ridiculed me.

-You brought this onto yourself.
-What?

Washington is sending down a new B.P.R.D agent.

A new guy?

-Why?
-To look after you.

Sir... Please.

/Father./

/Why?/

/Why did you do this to me?/

-/Why?/
-To set us free.

-All of us, Father.
-/Break a former truce.../

/...In our own town and our home./

The truce is based on shame!

The humans...

...the humans have forgotten us, destroy the earth, then for what?

Parking lots, shopping malls...

...Greed had burned a hole in their hearts, They will NEVER be filled, they will NEVER have enough.

/Is this not what humans do/

/Is this not in there nature?/

Honor? Look at this place!

...Where is the dignity.

Father, you were once a proud warrior.

When did you become their pet?

I have returned from exile to wage war...

...and reclaim OUR land, OUR birthright!

And for that I will call upon the help of all my people, and they will answer.

The good, the bad...

...and the worst.

/My golden amulet!/

-/You cannot be that defiant./
-Perhaps, I am.

Perhaps, they made me so.

/You hold the amulet.../

/... Our green fields are blood stained./

/Leave your army to rest./

/Our ritual has ended.... or you will fade away./

We will NOT fade.

/For the last time I beg you, my son.../

-/Is this the way you would take your last drink?/
-It is.

-I'm sorry, Father.
-/You leave me no choice./

/Death!/

And you, Sister... are you peace with the King's verdict?

I am, my brother... I am.

Then very well. Death it is.

/I'll always love you, Father./

Now, now for the final piece my sister.

Where is she? Where is she?!

Go to find her! Now! Finder her!

Excuse me. Excuse me.

-Is he here?
-Not yet.

-I'm telling you we don't need this guy.
-Oh, I think we do.

Evidently, this guy is quite a big shot in Washington.

-What's his name?
-His name...

...is Johann Krauss.

-Johann Krauss?
-hmm.

-Sounds German.
-He's a top man in ecto...

-Ectoplasmic
-Yes, thank you. Ectoplasmic research.

...comes highly recommended by our European liaison.

-Crap.
-Liaison, I love that word, don't you? It's quitey-tweedy.

-I don't like German.
-No fingerprints.

-Here he come.
-German makes me nervous.

No photo. Dossier says, and I translate "He has a nice....

...open face."

Oh my God...

Johann Krauss at your service.

I like him.

Look at that, poor little thing.

Bought and sold on the black market, crammed into cargo container, smuggled, abused...

-It's very expressive hand.
-The seal on the box worries me also.

-Organ emblem.
-Yes, from the Bethmora clan, the Suns of the earth.

Your higher says you are the brains of the operation. And I must admit I'm impressed.

In my file, you'll see Mr Krauss, I work very closely with Abe in his training.

Yeah. OK, Let's see what our little friend here can remember.

Remember you get a little sketchy right after you burned to death.

But ..

-Maybe St. Malarkey can help.
-No, no no. Ambulant my heaven.

-Teleplasty.
-Plastic, very modern.

Teleplasty. By which ectoplasmic medium, such as Dr Krauss... can control inanimate things.

...organic, mechanical... dead or alive.

Take it, take it all in, my dear.

Very well, there we are.

Get up. Get up. Get up.

Now I have full control of it's limbic system.

Let's see how long I can hold it.

What?!

*Cue off the tip of my tail.

-He says you're rude, brutish, or not very smart.
-Wow.

It seems that our little friend here remembers the market sounds and voices.

And a particular troll ligament talking in last place his case was open.

The troll market!

The troll market? Come on, no one has ever found it.

That because it doesn't exist.

Krauss, Dr Krauss, sir, our little performance doesn't look so good.

There we are. So...

Now we know where to begin. Trolls dwell under bridges...

You're a genius.

By the way, there are over 2000 bridges in New York city.

But Vladimir Vania, 19 century out cult historian, placed the troll market directly under the east end of the Brooklyn Bridge.

-We've already looked there.
-Yes, you have, but not with me, Agent.

Not with me. We're moving in!

-"Not with me, Agent", what an ego!
-I like him.

Well, you can keep him.

-Am I the only one that thinks this guy is...
-No, no no, don't lean.

Lock 336. The Schuftan time glasses. Could it be?!

For three surviving pairs, and if you use them to look, it's troll market.

Dr Krauss, what a Kool! The Schuftan time glasses. You are my hero.

Hey! You're the hellboy! You rock me man!

Two more on the wall in front of me, and then three on the alley facing that way.

-What do you think of Mr Know-It-All?
-I don't know, too early to tell.

-You're Hellboy!
-I know I'm ugly.

Forget it!

We'll talk about it later.

Be sure of themselves. And I think... maybe you're intimidating.

What's this?

Normally we can not see fairy folk and trolls, they generate...

...a cloaking aura or a glamor. But in 1878 Emile Schuftan designed and built these.

Four crystal diopters penetrate that effect, and reveal the true nature of things.

-Oh, Dr Krauss, they're more beautiful than I imagine.
-You must try them.*

Yes, look at those tight little leather straps.

-Intimidating? Huh!

-Mr Krause Sir?
-Krauss, Agent, it's double ss.

SS, right right.

Listen, those gizmos...

How do you know they work?

-I have a suspect.
-Give me a vector, Agent Sherman, a vector.

-B 12 the alley, north valley.
-Here's the target, we're coming down.

-Keep an eye on it. Be right back.
-This here?

-This little old lady? Come on.
-It's a fag worm.

An ugly Scottish troll. They're afraid of Canaries.

Oh my God.

Canaries?

-What about the kittens?
-She feeds on them.

That thing is a She?

Down your foolish, what do you think you are doing?

-She's gonna eat the cat!
-You'll make her aware our presents!

-We should use the canary now.
-She's gonna eat!

We should use the bird, Dr Krauss, the bird.

-She's gonna eat...
-Stay, * and follow my orders.

-I can't sit by!
-You're under my command and you have to obey!

Lucy! I'm home!

-Yes, dear can I help you?
-Give it up nasty, we can see you.

You see me? How?

How do you see me?

Looking for the entry to the troll market, any clues?

Get a little close and I'll rip your heart!

We have to get the old school? Give me the buddy.

-No canary!
-What? You're afraid of this little guy?

No more, no more, I'll take you there.

Come on, let's go, you dirty old troll.

Let's go.

Agent Sherman, we are going into the troll market. Keep the communication to the minimum.

-I like him. See, this is the man who takes charge.
-You think?

-He's efficient, he's precise.
-Add resistant to that, and you got yourself a new watch.

Dr Krauss is aware of genus command. And he seems like me.

Here we are.

Wow that's some door.

It is a complex combination lock.

-What do you think Agent Sapian?
-Not good.

-With numbers of symbols on combination, we will be here for days.
-No necessarily...

Let me try my technique. Open it Lucy.

-I will NOT!
-Pretty please.

Tear my eyes out, Stress the insides and my legs and my tongue...

I will NEVER open that door!

Is that your investigative technic?

-She said never.
-It's unrcontionable.

That meant he didn't like it.

So you're gonna show us how it's done? Mr By-The-Book?

-Is that it?
-Yes, I think I will.

Very well.

Let me see it. Yes.

Gentlemen, welcome to the troll market.

/Fresh fish./

/Buy your fresh fish.../

Red, there's something really important, and I need to tell you.

Liz, you should be here. You'd love it. Nobody is looking at us. We blend right in.

-Agent, I said keep communication to minimum. You'll blow out our cover.

You know I think he's right.

-I'm breaking you here for sure babe. Just want the radio silent. So...
-Over now.

The royal seal.

Red, do you read me?

Yeah, read you, Blue. But there's a watching show I gotta work. I'll get back to you.

Excuse me. sir... sir...

Sir, may I ask you something?

Excuse me gentlemen, have you seen anyone purchasing this type of tooth fairy?

-No one sells them down here, pal.
-In New Jersey maybe.

What about this, then, do you recognize this seal?

Make him go away! Make him go away!

You better go!

You may reverse your line.

Don't waste our time! We will not talk!

-Are you sure about that?
-Absolutely.

-You're talking!
-Never!

-Never?
-Never Ever Ever!

-Feel a little chatting now?
-He'll never talk.

Yes, wait a minute, don't take me anymore.

Chicken!

-Who brought the tooth fairies?
-Prince Nuada.

They say Prince Nuada broke the truce and now there is talk of war.

A war in human world.

-Sorry Kid.
-That's all right.

-What a nice baby.
-I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor.

Yes. Red. I'm following the lead right now.

It may turn out to be nothing, but I will let you know soon enough.

What you want? Tell me your name.

Follow me.

His father left you this map.

In it he said lies the secret to the location of the golden army.

Move away, quickly your highness.

-Can I help you with something?
-No, thank you, I'm just looking.

You CAN'T go in there!

Sir? Why are you following me?

-I was just hoping to find an old map charges...

-Why are you following me?
-I was not!

Did my brother send you to steal the crown piece?

Your brother? You're solely mistaken. I assure you...

Then tell me truthfully, why are you following me?

My name is Abraham Sapien.

-There is no such name.
-I don't like it either. But I...

-Enough, give me your hand.
-Huh?

Your hand!

You are an agent for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.

And your name is...

Horrible, I know.

I am Nuala, Princess Nuala.

Yes, I know. Forgive me your highness. But...

...as you're learning about me, I couldn't help to learn a bit about you myself.

-I know that you need our help.
-I am afraid that there's other way around.

The window, out now. I'll take care of this.

Go! Now go!

-Get out of here, Blue.
-Yes, come with me your highness.

You ..

Let me put this as delicately as I can.

Cigar! It was Cuban! Now you pissed me off.

Crap!

Now stay down!

Damn!

Tooth. Happy?

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Wow, told you.

OMG, what have you done, Agent Hellboy, look at this. Now we have to leave.

Red, this is Princess Nuala.

-Lady.
-We should leave, now!

/So what do you have to tell me?/

To wage his war, my brother needs this... the final piece of the Crown of Bethmora.

-And the map to the location of golden army chamber.
-The golden army...

...the harbingers of death, the unstoppable tide.

Your highness, if you hands the crown piece over to us...

No. Where it goes, I go.

My father died to uphold the truce with your world. You must honor his noble intentions.

-The lady is in dire danger.
-I take is your are vouching for her, Agent Sapien?

Most emphatically, yes I am.

Even so...

I am sorry, but we simply can not assume such responsibility on our own.

Lady just lost her father, what more do you want?

You may not care, but there are procedures, rules, and little handbooks that...

-She's coming with us. You got that, Gasbag?!
-What did you call me?

You!

You will pay for what happened to my friend down there.

Yeah, right. You take checks?

Demon, born from a womb of shadows, sent to destroy their world and you still believe you belong?!

Are we going to talk all night, because I'm really sleepy?

No, Brother! No!

Kill him.

-It's just a jumping bean!
-It's going for water! Hurry!

-It's an elemental, the giver of life, and the destroyer.
-Huh?

The Forest God.

Forest God?

I'll give him a big baby.

Help!

-How can I help you, Ma'am?
-The baby's still inside...

Come this way lady, please. There's nothing to worry about, because everything is under control.

Hey, little guy.

Hang on, kid.

Agent Hellboy, leave the child aground, use the weapon!

-You must shoot his energy...
-What?

-The energy *...focus on the head!

Shoot it in the head!

Aw, Crap.

You gotta trust me little buddy, OK?

You woke up the baby.

Agent hellboy! Take the shot right now!

Take it, that's the order! Take the shot! That's an ordering! Hellboy!

Shoot it! Shoot it now!

Demon! What are you waiting for? This is what you want, isn't it?

Look at it. The last of its kind...

...like you and I.

If you destroy it, the world will never see its kind again...

You have more in common with us than with them.

You could be a king...

Shoot it! It's getting loose!

-If you cannot command, than you must obey.
-Damn.

It is beautiful.

-What have you done to my baby?
-Baby is fine.

-The baby is fine!
-Don't move! Hands in air!

-He's got a weapon in his hand!
-That is his hand!

Miss, stay away from him, for your safety.

He was trying to help, don't you see? He was just try to help!

That's all we do! That's all we've done all these years!

We just try to help YOU! YOU!

You freak! We don't need your help!

Liz...

Let's go home.

...investigation of B.P.R.D. And here's a promotion of inter-spieces marriage assumed...

...a threat to traditional families and us federal founds.

I didn't touch you yet.

You did a good job out there.

Then tell me why I feel so bad.

I mean... I killed that thing, for what?

No one likes me, and they're afraid of me.

What do we do with that?

Red, I don't want you to freak out.

I'm gonna leave... for a little bit. I need time to think.

About what? Can you just think it right here?

Look, I'll be really really quite, I'll get rid of the cats.

Red, why are you with me?

Do you need everyone to like you? Everybody?

Or I enough? Think about it.

Blank? No coordinates.

ï¼ƒBe near me when my light is low,ï¼ƒ

ï¼ƒWhen the blood creeps, and the nerves prick,ï¼ƒ

ï¼ƒAnd tingle; and the heart is sick,ï¼ƒ

ï¼ƒAnd all the wheels of Being slow.ï¼ƒ

ï¼ƒBe near me when the sensuous frame.ï¼ƒ

ï¼ƒIs rack'd with pangs that conquer trust; ï¼ƒ

-ï¼ƒAnd Time, a maniac...ï¼ƒ
-Tennyson.

''In Memoriam''. A Beautiful poem. Forgive me I didn't mean to startle you.

No, no. I borrow this book... I hope you don't mind.

No, no, no. Please, is your home now.

-You're safe here.
-My brother will find me.

-He always does.
-How could he. This location is highly classified secrets.

Yes, but I know it, which means he does too.

We're twins. Even when as children, a link has bound us, one to the other.

-Something I can't not explain.
-No need.

-You... look different.
-Do I? Perhaps my hair?

No, It's your eyes. I can see your eyes.

Just trying a new... look.

Is that map?

Yes, it was in the cylinder. There're no coordinates.

Perhaps, there's a watermark.

You're very brave, vouching for me? How do you know I'm not the enemy bringing me here.

Just what you're saying, just now.

From intuition... maybe... a link?

Normally I'm able to read up this quite quickly, but...

I've never met anyone like you.

No, I like you!

Good night, Abraham.

Good night, Princess, Your highness, Your Ma'am... Ma'am?

Good night, Agent Hellboy.

-Look, Agent, I know you don't like me, but I could take away your badge.
-Never have one. Keep asking though.

You'll learn to obey me, follow the protocol, and stay focÃ¼se/focus all time.

That word, "focÃ¼se"? Yeah with your accent, I wouldn't use that much.

-I knew Professor Broome, young man.
-You don't know Professor Broome.

-Yes I did, after I left, he designed this tangency.
-Shut up!

-A wonderful man, even then he was very worried about your future.
-Stop!

-Right now.
-Or what? Are you threatening me?

Because I think I can take you.

-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

I couldn't hear you from... all the way over there.

I can take you... because you have one fatal flaw.

-Oh, I wanna hear it.
-No, you don't, you can't take criticism.

-Try me.
-Can't - take - it.

What's my flaw ~?

Your temper. It gets the best of you, makes you weak, makes you vulnerable...

Johann.

Johann!

Come on, pal, hanging on there, will you?

Johann? Johann!

There we are. Your temper makes you sloppy, try to control it Agent Hellboy.

...before it controls you...

Glasshole!

#Can't smile without you#

Aha, hello Red.

-What are you listening to?
-Vivaldi, cimento dell'armonia.

-What's that?
-Just a remote.

This, yes...

Popular love songs?

Oh, Abe, you fell for the Princess?

She's like me, a creature from another world.

-* get out more.
-She's alone in the world. I want to help her, I need to care for her.

You're in love. Have a beer.

-No, my body's a temple.
-Now it's an amusement park.

-No, no, the gland...
-Just shut up and drink it, will you?

-What track?
-Eight.

"Can't smile without you"

-I know.
-Yeah, I'm gonna need a beer too.

See, I love the song. And I can't smile.

... or cry. I think I have no tear ducts.

I wish Father were here, he knows what to tell you... us

-/Nuala/
-/You're here./

Good dog.

It's the last one~!

Look at it. She's it. She's my WHOLE life.

You know? I will give my life for her.

But she also wants me to do the dishes.

-I would do anything...
-She's mad at me. It's not because of the rooms duty, something else.

-Well, ask her then.
-No~!

Listen Abe, when woman's mad about something but she's really mad about something else...

You CAN'T ask. Cuz then she'll get angry because you have ask.

You know what I mean? Never mind, don't ask that question.

-You gotta just...
-Yeah...

...find out.

Very quickly of you. The parchment was of no importance. The cylinder...

...is very interesting.

We will find golden army... here.

As for the crown piece, I know it's here. I can feel that much in you.

Father always tried so hard to shield your heart from mine.

It's in one of the books, and I will find it.

Blue? You always look so beautiful in blue.

Blue! Poetry, love, found and lost. Other words. I will find it.

-Listen, Red. I know what's going on with Liz, Red.
-Abe!

-I'm sorry he has to know.
-Know what?

Why?

-Stay back!
-Abraham!

-No, don't, he'll kill you.
-Princess?

/Abraham? Is that what drives him to you?/

-No!
-I WILL kill you, Abraham.

And anyone else if that's necessary.

Well, then why don't you just start with me? Your Royal-Ass-ness?

-And your weapon no choice?
-Five fingers matters.

You move, and I'll kill Abraham first.

-Red, you mustn't hurt the Prince.
-What?

If you hurt him, you hurt the Princess!

-Will you give me the crown piece?
-No.

The piece.

-Abe
-Red, I'm so sorry but there's a link...

-Liz!
-Right behind you!

You may have mused in the past, am I mortal?

You are now.

Abraham, many people have died for this crown, he will too.

If you want to save him... and SEE her again. You will find the missing piece and bring it to me.

Jesus, pull that damn thing out!

I can not. Every time I touched it, every time I came close to it. It was close to his heart.

I don't know what else to do. The wound would not heal until the spear is removed.

-We're running out of time.
-Then we'll go ask for the Prince.

We MAKE him to take it out.

-Liz, you ask...?
-Shut up.

No, no. let me tell you. I know what's important.

It's you. I can turn my back on the world, all of it...

-As long as you stay with me.
-I'll stay with you. You're the best man I ever met.

Man...

*So the cylinder used coordinates to County Antrim in the Northern Ireland.

The Giant Causeway, right about... here.

Great, so we know where he is. What are we waiting for, we should get going.

-Prince demands the crown piece, Agent Sherman.
-So? We give it to him.

-Dr. Manning.
-I'm afraid. It's not simple with that.

-Hold on here, what are you saying?
-The Golden army must not awaken.

So what? You're just gonna let him die, is that it?

I'm sorry, They called Washington, they have our orders.

-What about you? He saved your life.
-I know.

-I know it's difficult for you, but...
-Well, I won't let him die.

Agent Sherman, may I remind you that I AM the leader of this team!

-Oh, there is no doubt about that, Sir. That's what you are, Dr Krauss. And if ever you were a human. That time is long gone.

-What's wrong with her? You want me to call her back, sir?
-Let her go, I understand.

-What about you? You find anything?
-No, nothing yet.

-Well, keep looking!
-Absolutely, sir.

All of you! Don't worry sir. We know it's here. We're gonna find it.

Tell Manning get on the case. Things get done, they get done. They get done!

Even without the piece, we HAVE to get him out of here.

We'll go to the Antrim, and we will find the prince.

Abe!

-Just two of us.
-Yes, yes.

Let's go.

We need to leave now, before they run clearance upstairs.

Good evening, my friends. Do you have authorization to take that plane?

You're not gonna stop us, Johann.

On the contrary, I've been giving it some thought, and it should be able to save Agent Hellboy.

You say I'm not human any more.

But you're wrong, I can understand your pain all too well.

A long time ago, I lost the woman I loved. And that was in fact the source of my present misfortune.

I'll tell you about it one day. But for now the tactical advantage is ours.

Consider this. The Prince lacks the crown piece, and without it his army poses no threat.

-So, we have clearance then?
-Agent Sherman... Liz, screw the clearance! We'll "TAKE" that plane!

It should be here some place. The entry should be... here.

-I don't understand.
-Perhaps there's some mistakes on the map.

Hello there!

I bet you welcome, strangers. How can I give you a assistance?

We're seeking safe passage to Bethmora.

What does a nice little girl like you want a night lungs.

-We are looking for Prince Nuada.
-I know.

-Trade me something. And I'll take you to him.

-Here I have a shiny belt.
-But I have no pants.

-Look, a wonderful set of magic eyes.
-I already have binoculars.

But... I see something special, something shinning underneath that bandages. I want that!

-No, you CAN'T take it out. Not without killing him.

Maybe I know someone who can! Will you trade me then?

-All right.
-Very well.

Keep going. Keep going.

Oh my God ..

You should see this city when it was alive.

-What happened to it?
-Curse.

Soon as the golden army were stored here, plague, silence and death fell on us. World left us behind.

For long time I alone dwell in the dust.

All right, little girl. The two of you come inside. The rest of you wait out here.

Hello friend. I have brought you the visitors.

-I have a favor to ask you.
-I have no favor to you, goblin.

-Fleece!
-But I have done so much for you.

I have brought you many souvenirs. And he has something shinny, something mine.

-Anung un Rama...
-You know that name?

And yours, Elizabeth Sherman.

At last, I have been waiting for you both, many a window moon.*

I... I am his death and I will meet him at each crossroad.

Good. When can I get that which is mine?

-Can you save him?
-It is for you to decide that. It is all the same to me, my heart is filled with dust and sand.

But you should know, it is his destiny...

...to bring about the destruction of the Earth

Not now, not tomorrow... but soon enough.

Knowing that, you still want him to live?

So child make a choice, the world? Or him?

-Him.
-The time will come, and you my dear... will suffer more than anyone.

I'll deal with that. Now save him.

It is... it's done.

I have done what I can, now give him a reason to live.

Hey friend! What about that which is mine? Don't forget about me!

What about me? Friend?

Shinny!

Listen to me, you big ape.

You have to get up.

You have to get up.

Cuz you're gonna be a father.

I'll become...

...father?

Wow, all these are very touching. But, if you still wanna meet Nuada.

We have to leave... now.

Ready.

Here we are. and there... they are.

70 times 70 soldiers.

Sometimes I wish I never created it.

They enbomb with horrories, whoosh with furnaces.

One of those fires took the legs of me.

This is the farthest I can go. I am not very good at steps.

But if you're here to stop him, the Prince, I wish you luck then.

-The golden army must not awaken. Undo what we did.
-We will.

You're here. So I assume you've brought me the remain piece.

-No, we didn't. But we should discuss...
-I wasn't addressing you... Tin man.

-Abraham.
-Abraham?

-My sister is well, as I promised.
-Abe!

-So...
-/Don't Do it. Abraham./

What the hell are you doing?!

You'll do the exactly same for Liz.

Agent Sapien... No!

I am the prince Nuada, Silverlance, leader of the golden army.

Is there anyone here who'll dispute my right?

Kill them!

He lied to us!

Abe buddy, we ever get out of this, we gotta talk.

Open wide!

Indestructible my ass!

Throw me a body!

Well, I'm out of ideas.

I got one.

I challenge...

...Prince Nuada... for the right to combat... this army.

-You're not royalty.
-Yes.

You challenge me? Who are you to challenge me? You're nobody!

Yes! He's Anung un Rama, son of the fallen one! He has the right! Challenge must be answered.

Very well, then.

-Red!
-Think about it! He will kill you, Red.

Don't worry babe.

I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

But I'm gonna kick his ass.

Nice ride, huh?

You jumping slippery bastard! I gotcha now.

Kill me you must, for I will not stop. I can not...

Sorry, pal, I will.

You live.

Nuala...

The humans...

They will tired of you.

They will wage against you.

Leave them...

Is it them or us?

...which holocaust should be chosen?

I never had a chance to tell you how I felt.

Give me your hand.

It's beautiful.

We die....

...and the world will be poorer for it.

Nuala, my sister...

-All that power...
-Don't even think about it!

No... It's nothing, I told you it's an dead-end.

What are you doing? Go away!

Check up their belt locators.

Check up their belt locators. Over there!

Over there!

You.

You took that plane without authorization, young man.

Manning, here to help.

As always. What going on? What's going on?

I quit.

-Are you serious?
-Looks that way, doesn't it?

What's wrong with you. You can't all just quit!

Watch us.

On second thought...

I think I'll keep this.

Come on. Come on!

Johann, they can't do this, stop them.

Dr Manning... Suck my ectoplasmic SchwanzstÃ¼cke!

So what have you said before, about us, going anywhere?

Anywhere, you and me. Let's find a place in the country.

Clean air, green hills.

A yard, with lots room to grow it. It'd be great for the baby!

The babies...
