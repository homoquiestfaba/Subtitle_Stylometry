Oh?

Congratulations.
Thanks.

I'd better be getting on home.
OK. 'Bye.

Say hi from me.
Will do. See you.

What did Leo want?
To pick up that MadMan.

What?

He's going to be a dad.
Oh? That's OK.

Norway drew one all.

The second time in this World Cup.

All they needed
to do was beat Brazil.

They'd won all
their previous games.

They getthere and
they can't play at all.

Bloody awful timing
on the part oftheir coach.

When I gotthere at 4:40
people were waiting outside.

When I gotto Inco
they'd closed the place down.

Rats had chewed through
the ceiling during the night.

They'd closed itto get rid
ofthe rats, and then last night...

What rats?
The rats at Inco.

They covered the floor
with flour last night-

to see ifthe rats
waded around in it.

They can see their footprints.
Weird.

And todaythere's this silver
wedding do on the fourth floor.

They've lived
in the same flatfor 25 years.

Amazing they haven't got arthritis
from all those stairs.

And you get here
at seven minutes pastfive.

I can't stand people being late,
it's bad timing.

Fucking bad timing.

Seven minutes isn'tthat much.
You're meantto be here at 5.

It bugs me when people
don't show up on time -

you can't plan things
with people like you.

It's kind of irritating.

Hi, Mum.
I'm fine... yes, I am.

I am pregnant.

Yes... yes...

8 weeks... just a minute, Mum.

...Hang on.

Mum? I'll call you back
in a moment, all right?

I promise. OK. 'Bye.

Is that it, then?

Yes.
And it's certain?

Is it OK?

Yes.

Don'tyou think...

Maybe it's not a good thing...

Will you come in here?

Why?
Come on.

Can'twe get rid of some ofthis?

Why?

To make room.
We hadn'ttalked about it.

What do you mean?
The baby.

We've talked about it
a thousand times.

And you said you wanted kids,
right?

With me?
Sure.

I'm not having any more abortions,
right?

There's plenty oftime.
Yes, there's plenty oftime.

But I want it now.
But atyourpace...

Why move mythings?
You can move your things.

I justwantthings to be different.
Now.

No reason
to get pissed off.

I'm not pissed off.

I don'twantto
talk any more about it, OK?

What have you been doing today?

Not much.
I wentto work.

Hi.
Hi.

Congratulations.
How did you know?

The old lady left a message
on my machine... exciting, right?

Is it good?
Not much difference yet.

Oh...
What aboutyou?

How are you taking it?

It's fine.

So your gear works after all.

It's notjust blanks.

What aboutyour tummy?

You can't see anything.
Notyet.

What's with the faggot?
Whythe grunting?

Problems? Are you sure?
Everything's fine.

He's fine?
He's not bothered any more?

If he's fine, I'm fine.

Oh, that'll be mum.

Hi, Mum.
Hi.

No, Louis has come.
Want a word?

Oh, no, he'sjust left.
...She's phoned 5 times today.

I haven'ttime to talkto her.

It's fine.

So am I, you bet.
And you're going to be a gran!

Take good care of her, right?

Yeah, of course.
I mean...

Yes.

Can we have a word?
Yes, but I have to getto work.

We'll take a walk.
My old baby clothes.

Can't I have them?
We'rejust going out.

Will you be back?
I have to getto work, so...

I'll be back shortly.
Will you bring them nexttime?

You knowthat's a cemetery, right?
Sure.

And Louise's nursery is right here.
Yeah. So?

It's weird living nextto
a cemetery and an nursery.

Oh, I don't know.
I live over a takeaway.

I once went in there.

Climbed over the wall,
pulled over a few headstones.

It's totally scary, man.
With big guard dogs.

We got out in a hurry.

Have you got any kids?
Notthat I know of.

Would you want any?
When all's said and done, yes.

It's whatwe're here for.
Yeah...

You'd tell me ifyou had any.
You'd be the firstto know.

Hey, is something up?
Not at all.

I justwanted to know
ifyou had any.

Are you sure, or what?
Yeah.

Joe?

How did it go yesterday?
Itwas shit.

Nothing but coloured bastards.

You always saythat.
They are always trouble.

Always.

They rush in and feel up the girls.
All ofthem.

You're such a git.
Itjust isn't right.

I let some ofthem in.
Just one and there's trouble.

They can't behave,
no matter whatyou do.

They're like wild animals.
Who's he?

My brother-in-law, Leo.
Oh, you knocked Louise up?

He's going to be a dad.
Getthe kid educated.

School-wise.
What do you mean?

The schools are full
of blacks and coloureds.

Things will work out.
He's so cheerful.

I'm not racist.
I eatfalafel, too.

You'rejust a git.
Here comes trouble.

Two monkeys
and you've gottrouble.

You can't come in.
What?

You can't come in.
Justfor a look?

No way.

You're serious?
100%.

You can't come in.
Are you taking the piss?

100%... you can't come in.
Mellow out, man.

Let us in for a look.
No fucking way.

Let's go in for a look.
No way.

Fuckyou.
I'm sick of all this.

They're nothing buttrouble.

They get into a temper
just like that.

Do you knowthem?
No.

I've seen one ofthem before.
They're crazy.

He's got a gun.
Fuck.

Get him inside.

Come and get it, you bastards.

May I come out?

I'd like to go now.

Hi.
Hi.

I saw a guy get shot.

What?

Down at Louis'.

Some guys weren't allowed in,
and so they used guns.

Who?

I don't knowwho theywere.

Is Louis OK?

Yes, he's OK.

Hi.

Hi.

You don't recognise me?
No.

I've seen you atthe video store.

You workthere?
Yeah.

Been waiting long?
Ten minutes.

I work atthe video store.

Yes.

'Bye.

How are you doing?
Fine, thanks.

And you?
Fine.

That's nice.

You work atthe diner, right?
Yes.

I go there sometimes.
I thought I'd seen you before.

Yes, I work down atthe video store.

Have you gotthe time?
No.

Didn'tyou rent Casino lastweek?
Yes.

I think I was atworkthat day.

Was it good?
Yes, itwas OK.

I am going the other way.
See you.

Put itthere.

Where?
Here, on the wall.

OK.

Or what do you reckon?
I reckon it'll go fine here.

Itwas also fine in the lounge.
And in the kitchen.

Or here, so you could look
atyourself having a crap.

Put itthere.
Sure?

Yes.

What do you think Leo'll think?
Leo'll think it's fine.

You reckon?
Yes. I'll hang it here, right?

That's right.

There.

Now I've done that, too.
Two people become three.

I'm really looking forward to it.
Are you?

Yes... Baby.

No, I don'tthinkyou can compare
Steven Seagal to Fred Williamson.

Sure you can.
Impossible.

Anyway, I wasn't comparing.
I just sayWilliamson is king.

You can't saythat.
You can't.

I might as well say
Steven Seagal is king; him, -

Charles Bronson,
and Franco Nero.

And Fred Williamson.
And Bruce Lee?

Seventies stuff.
Yes.

And the best ever made.
So what are Bronson and Franco Nero?

They use firearms. Guns,
like everyone else. Timeless.

After all, this is the nineties.
Yes.

You like Steven Seagal
but not Bruce Lee.

That's whatyou're saying.
I just said Seagal is better.

Yes, you said Seagal is better.
He's fatter, that's all.

Cutthe crap!
He'sjustwell-built, strong.

You can't saythat!
He is!

He's a lump.
Hey! When is Louis coming?

He said he'd leave atten past.
Ten pastwhat?

I don't know.

Steven Seagal is fat.

Have you screwed her?
What?

Her.
Who?

Her you're thinking about.

What's her name?
I don't remember.

What did you talk about?

All kinds of stuff.
Films, I think.

Films?
Yes.

So you didn'ttalk, then.
Yes, we did.

No, you didn't.
You talked aboutfilms.

You haven'ttalked to each other.
Really.

It's abnormal.
Have you screwed her?

You haven't screwed her.
You haven'ttouched her, either.

Is thatthe wayyou see girls?

To be talked to, nottouched,
not screwed? It's abnormal.

Kitjo?
Yes?

How are things?
Hi.

Hi, Louis.
Doesn't it need some paint?

I was thinking of replacing it.
You've got more?

I've got one with Fred Williamson.
Fred Williamson?

Shall we find it?
No.

We're going to watch a movie.
It'll onlytake five minutes.

We're going to watch a movie now.

Or what?

Is there time to go round the shop?
I'll come with you.

I'll wait here.
Shall we getyou anything?

Beer.
Three beers. Tuborg.

Hi.
Good evening.

What do you want?
I'lljust have a look.

What do you want?
Iced tea.

Peach.

Yes, OK, I'll have that one.

And these.

Anything else?
Yes.

One ofthose?
Yes.

Anything else?
No, I don'tthink so.

9, please.
9? For that?

It's the same anywhere else.
No, it isn't.

It's cheaper down the street.
No, the same.

What's the problem?
I justthink it's expensive.

Checkyour change.
Or the nigger'll cheatyou.

What did you say?

Nigger.
And you can sit down, Mohammed.

What's the problem?
You are. I'm tired ofyour kind.

You thinkyou rule the place.
I'm not listening.

Anything else? If not, you can leave.

Black bastard.
Go home and fuckyour mother.

Get out.

Black bastard.

Black cunt.

I'm sorry aboutthat.
What kind offriends have you got?

Sorry.

OK? Sorry.

It's no good.
No.

I said sorry, OK?
See you later.

There it is.

Take your beer, OK?
Yes.

Oh? Yes.

Shit... there he goes.

He hadn't reckoned on that.

She's got one, too.

Where do all those guns come from?

What?
Where do they all come from?

What do you mean?
You knowwhat I mean.

Lfthey need a gun,
onejust appears.

Yes. It's a film.
I know it's a film.

Hey, we're watching a film, OK?
I just don't get it.

How come
they all know about guns?

You think about it a lot?
Yes.

I don't know.
It's as if...

...all of a sudden
they all know howto fire them.

Even ordinary people like us.
Why all this talking?

Who's talking?
I am, because you are.

I wasn'ttalking, Leo was.
Don'tyou think about it as well?

Doesn't he like this film or what?
Sure. Let's watch it, OK?

Yeah...

Itjust doesn't look
like that in real life.

I saw a guy get shot a few days ago.
Louis was there as well.

It doesn't look like that,
does it?

I really don't know
whatyou're on about.

One of Louis' friends got shot.

And then he began
beating the guy up.

You beat him up, didn'tyou?

I really don't remember.
No. You don't?

Not beating him up?

Have you ever shot anyone?
No.

Any animals?
No.

A rabbit?
No.

Isn'tthat an animal?
Yes. Have you?

No.

Would you like to?
No.

Can you get me a gun?
Whatthe fuckfor?

For fun.
They're notfor fun.

Can you get me one?
No.

What do you mean?
I mean no. Are you stupid?

What do you mean?
It's only a film.

You watch films, you knowfuck all.
You watch four films a day. OK?

Just don'ttell Louise.
She'd throw a fit.

Can you get me one?
No.

An Uzi?

Oh. Yes...

He forgotto shutthe door.

But he's shut it now.

And now it's blown up.

Got nothing to do?
No, nobody's been in.

I've looked atthe figures.
You serve 2000 beefburgers a year.

That's about 30 cows.
I've only been here 6 weeks.

That makes 231.

Don'tyou ever get bored?
Sometimes.

What aboutyou?
Are you bored?

Yes.
Here?

Sometimes.
How about doing some washing up?

OK.

No, I haven't.

Why not?
Do you think it's disgusting?

A bit.

It's quite normal,
getting a blowjob from a fish.

Have you seen this one?
Which one?

Is it real?
Yes.

No way.
Hold it.

Be careful, it's loaded.
With live ammo.

There's something inside?
Yes.

What are you going to do with it?
I don't know.

Where did you get it?

You got itfrom Louis, or what?

What are you doing tonight?
Me? Going to the cinema.

I'm going with someone.

You could come.

A girl?
Yes.

You're taking her out?
Yes.

No problem, then.

No, should it be?

In that case everyone is happy.

It's really hard.

May I hold him?
Yes.

Try holding him.
What?

Try holding him.

No.
Oh, go on.

No, I don'tthink so.

You might as well learn how.
Itwouldn't do.

Oh, wow, it's late.
We'd better be getting home.

All my stuff's gone.

Well...
