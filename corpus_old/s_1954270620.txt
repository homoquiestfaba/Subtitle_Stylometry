(CAR APPROACHING)

(ALL LAUGHING)
BRI: Oh, my God!

(LOUD THUMP)

LONNY: Go! Go! Go!

Let's do this.

What the fuck?

It's mischief night,
asshole!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, shit!

LONNY: Oh, my God!

Oh, crap!

CHUCK: Oh, my God.

Trick or treat, creeps.

CHUCK: Oh, God! Fuck!

KAYLIE: Uh-uh.

Not so fast, motherfucker.

LONNY: We'll be back,
you fucking bitch!
BRI: Screw you!

Stupid ho!
Fucking whore!

KAYLIE:  <i>No,</i>
<i>I haven't seen any kids</i>
<i>up to mischief tonight.</i>

KAYLIE:
<i>I'm looking down at him</i>
<i>right now, Mrs. Payton.</i>

He's, uh, well,
he's sleeping like a baby.

MRS. PAYTON:
<i>Good. Well, make sure</i>
<i>his little nightlight is on,</i>

<i>and you definitely</i>
<i>want to check in on him</i>
<i>every 15 minutes, okay?</i>

<i>Kaylie? Kaylie?</i>

<i>Stanley, I think</i>
<i>I lost her.</i>

What's that,
Mrs. Payton?

I stepped out of the room
as to not wake the baby.

(DISCONNECTED TONE)

Cunt.

Hmm.


Hmm.

You're kind of cute
for a cue ball.

Just as boring
as everything else
in this house.

The whole fucking town.


(DOORBELL RINGING)

(DOOR OPENING)

Hi! How you doing?

Hi.

May I ask you...
Are you alone
here tonight?

Yeah, just me
and my shotgun.

Oh! Your shotgun?

Well, hey, I...
There's a lot of
crazies out here,

you know, tonight,
the night that it is,

the night before Halloween.

So, I'm just kind
of going around
the neighborhood

door to door, you know?

Just checking that
everything's all right.

Oh, well,
everything is all right.

I'm, like, in
neighborhood watch.

I'm watching
the neighborhood.

This, I know, looks like
a sedate neighborhood,

you know,
middle class, whatever,

but we've had
so many problems.

We've had vandals.
We've got hooligans.

Some bastards, you know,
spray-painted my garage wall.

I'll kill those bastards.

And sects,
we've got sects.

Not sex, sects.

And what kind of sects,
I don't know...


You're very cute.
What's your name?

Kaylie.

Kaylie.
Hmm.

Cute. Okay.
Okay. All right.

One word of advice.

If anyone
comes to your door,

don't open it.

Do not open it.

You just never know
who's gonna be at the door.

So, listen, if there's
anything I can do,

I'll be... Around.

You're cute.

All right, take care.

Thanks.

Happy Halloween.



Hmm.

Naughty, naughty.


(BABY CRYING)

Aw!

That's a good baby.

Now shut the fuck up.

my cell phone wouldn't
work out here.

DAPHNE:
<i>It's the mountains, Kaylie.</i>

Just take a deep breath,

exhale,

<i>and suck it up, bitch.</i>

How much are
these deadbeats paying again?

<i>Twelve bucks an hour,</i>

and that's pretty
good considering.

<i>Considering what?</i>

Fuck 'em.
They're rolling in it.

<i>Hey, how do you think</i>
<i>I feel?</i>

It's the first
Friday off in two months,

it's the night
before Halloween,

and I'm stuck at home
puking my brains out.

<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

Look, can't we just
talk about some normal
girlie things for once?

<i>Sure. You got</i>
<i>anything in mind?</i>

<i>How about Graham?</i>
<i>Can we talk about him?</i>

Uh, I'd rather not.

Oh, come on.
You know it's not true.


I don't know, Daphne.
I don't get it.

It's like
I'm at my worst
when I'm near him.

<i>Sometimes it's like...</i>

I wanna cut my belly
open with a big knife

just to let out
all the butterflies.

What?

Do you know?

<i>That's not funny, Kaylie.</i>

<i>You can't joke</i>
<i>about cutting yourself</i>

<i>when you've been caught</i>
<i>doing it before.</i>

<i>Maybe it was a mistake</i>
<i>to let you babysit for me.</i>

<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you're feeling up to it?</i>

<i>What? Fuck off.</i>

<i>Hey, I'm just asking.</i>

<i>I mean, you're clearly</i>
<i>not up for talking to Graham.</i>

What's that
supposed to mean?

He's not such a hard guy
to talk to, you know?

<i>You sure</i>
<i>talk to him enough.</i>

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Doorbell.
<i>What?</i>

<i>Trick or treaters, maybe.</i>

A night early?

I'll call you back.
It's probably
just more pranksters.

<i>Wait, Kaylie, don't...</i>

Hello?

Jackass, I'm talking to you.


Graham!

Oh!

Hey, you're not Daphne.

Uh, Kaylie, right?

Right. I knew that.

I mean, obviously.

I mean... Shit.

Where's Daphne tonight?

She's...

I mean, I would
have called first,

but I know what
her cell phone's
like up here.

Yeah. Mountains.

I mean, but, you know,
she's been here
the last four Fridays,

so I just assumed...

Yeah. No.

I haven't seen her
at school and...

Yeah, well,
I am covering
for her tonight, so...

She's at home, though,
if you want her.

Anyway, no harm done, right?
'Tis the season.

Right.

Hey, Kaylie?


Uh...

Happy...
Yeah.

DAPHNE:  <i>How about Graham?</i>
<i>Can we talk about him?</i>

DAPHNE:  <i>He's not such</i>
<i>a hard guy to talk to,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

KAYLIE:  <i>You sure</i>
<i>talk to him enough.</i>

GRAHAM:  <i>Kaylie, right?</i>

<i>just to let out</i>
<i>all the butterflies.</i>

GRAHAM:
<i>Where's Daphne tonight?</i>

KAYLIE:  <i>Let out</i>
<i>all the butterflies.</i>

(PHONE RINGING)


Hello?

DAPHNE:
<i>Who was at the door?</i>

Your mom.


(GLASS SHATTERING)

(DOGS BARKING)

KAYLIE: Hello?

Good prank.

I bet you think
you're really fucking funny.

Hello?

(TWIG SNAPS)

(UNZIPPING PANTS)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(METAL CREAKING)


Dead, right?

(DIAL TONE)

Hmm!

DAPHNE:  <i>Hello?</i>
<i>Daphne?</i>

Kaylie? Are you okay?
You sound...

I think
there's someone here

at the house.

Some man. I don't know.

Maybe it's just
my imagination.

It's probably
just those kids
you messed with.

Maybe.

<i>So who was at</i>
<i>the door earlier?</i>

I don't think
this is a kid.

<i>He's at the front door.</i>

Are you being
serious right now?
Oh, you so aren't.

You so aren't.
You can't bullshit
a bullshitter.

You know that, right?

<i>And you can't prank me.</i>

I think I'll just
sit here and wait.

<i>Wait for what?</i>

If you're not
fucking around,

why don't you
just call the cops?

Yeah, and say what exactly?

<i>What you just told me!</i>

How tacky
do you think I am?

All right.
Then I'll call the cops.

Don't.

Then maybe I'll
just come over.

No, I wouldn't
if I was you.

Sure you wouldn't.

Daphne.
<i>I'll see you soon!</i>

No, Daphne,
don't use the front door!



(GIRL SHRIEKING)


KAYLIE:  <i>Don't use</i>
<i>the front door!</i>

<i>Daphne, don't use</i>
<i>the front door!</i>

All right, all right.

Pushy bitch.

Kaylie!

I know you're out here.

(LEAVES RUSTLING)

(LOUD THUD)

Wait!

(DAPHNE SCREAMING)


Hey, Daph,
it's about 9:15.

You said you'd be here,
so I'm just wondering
where you are.

I'm still a little
freaked right now.

There was definitely
somebody outside,

but not pissing my panties
or anything.

I think I scared him off.

I'll see you soon,
or call me
when you get this.

All right. Bye.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Hello?


So much for no reception.

Hello?

Hello?
WOMAN:  <i>Hello...</i>

Hello?
<i>Hey...</i>

Damn it. I can't hear you.
Hold on.

<i>Are you there... There?</i>

<i>I can... You're...</i>

KAYLIE: Hold on one sec.

<i>You're... Is someone...</i>

Hello?

(VOICE BREAKING)

<i>Hello!</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Kaylie?</i>

Oh, hey, Mom.

<i>Where are you?</i>

You know where I am.
I told you I'm filling
in for Daphne tonight.

<i>Some of my pills are missing.</i>
<i>You wouldn't happen</i>
<i>to be stealing them...</i>

No, I'm not stealing
your pills.

I don't want
your fucking pills.
<i>I am...</i>

If I wanted pills,
I'd get my own
fucking pills.

<i>You're lying to me.</i>
<i>You have one...</i>

Yeah. Good night.

(GLASS CRUNCHING)

Fuck.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)


Ahhh!

(GLASS SHATTERING)


(BREATHING HEAVILY)




Oh, shit.

You fucking bitch!

I'm gonna kill you!




(BABY GURGLING)
MAN: Open up! Fuck!

I'm gonna fucking
find you...

KAYLIE: Stay quiet.

MAN: You're dead!

You are so fucking dead!

(BABY GURGLING)




I'm gonna enjoy this.

You'll find some way
to fuck it up.

Not likely.

If you can fuck up
a basic Boy Scout knot,

you can fuck up
just about anything.

Are you gonna kill me?


Are you gonna kill me?

Take a wild fucking guess.

I finally get up
the nerve to do it,

to murder.

Don't... Don't.

Got the mask,
I bought a knife
and got all the clothes.

I find
the perfect neighborhood,

perfect house,

perfect... Victim.

I'm the boogeyman,

like in the movies.

No.

But the girl,

she can't just be
the perfect little victim,
can she?

She can't just
play her role.

She's gotta be
a feisty little fighter.

I'm gonna carve
you up, blondie.

You can't do this to me.
You can't.

Yeah? Why not?

Because I'm...
What?

I'm...

Yeah? You're what?

I'm still a virgin.

I'm still a virgin.

Un-fucking-believable.

What are you
thinking about?

What?

You're not gonna do it?


I didn't say
don't do it.

I just said I
didn't want to die
without being...

Oh!

Oh, you probably
can't get it up anyway.


Oh, you're dead!


I'm gonna fucking kill you.

I'm gonna cut off
your fucking head.

I'm gonna hack
out your kidneys
and cut open your liver.


I'm gonna smother
you with your own guts.


I'm gonna...

Yeah?

What?

I don't fucking get you!

You think you're some sort
of open book or something?

Yeah, I'm a teenager.
What's your excuse?

You got an answer
for everything, don't you?

I couldn't tell you
what's going on inside
your fucked-up head.

My fucked-up head?

My fucked-up head?

Priceless. That's just...

Priceless?


Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

You do that to yourself?

No.

The last serial killer I met.

Look, you're a sadist.
I'm a masochist.

You can tie me
up all you want,

but don't leave me
on my fucking side
like this!

All the blood is
rushing to my head

and I'm starting
to get dizzy.

Wait! You're not gonna
just leave me like this,
are you?

No, you can't
just do that.

When they find me,
my hand will be all blue

and they're probably
gonna have to amputate
my fucking fingers!


Thanks.

Don't mention it.

LONNY: Come on,
you pussies,

we gotta get
this bitch back!

What is it?

There's someone out there.
I don't want them to see me.

Well, well, well.
Back for a second round.

Hey, you wanna
have some fun?

CHUCK: Can we just go
play ding-dong-ditch
or something?

LONNY:
If you pussy out on me,
I'll break you.

CHUCK:
I'm with you, Lonny.

Hey, fuckers!
Hey, you looked.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

LONNY: You're dead,
you fucking bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!

All right, you can
put that down now.

Unless you still think
you wanna use it?


You're not very good
at this whole
serial killer thing, are you?

I can't believe this.

I can't fucking
believe this.

This doesn't make sense.
This is crazy.

No, it's not.

It's mischief night.

It's the one night
where anything goes.

They get their 364 days

of safety and reliability,
and stability,
and predictability.

They've even
co-opted Halloween
with their greeting cards

and UNICEF collections
and cupcakes.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em where they live,

because this is my night.

It's up for grabs,
and I wanna seize it.

My father always wanted me
to be his good little...

His sweet little...

In fact, he was
so worried about that,

that he never actually
bothered to look at me.

He was too busy
fitting in
with the rest of 'em.

And my mother?
Oh, you can forget it.

It's all outer smiles
and inner spite.

That's what they value.

That's who they are.

Street after street,
house after house...

A world of putrid shit

stinking up my insignificant
little existence.

I was always the kid
that talked to strangers

and took candy
from old men.

My name is Kaylie.

Coast is clear.

You can go now.

I know.

You wanna finish
what you started?

I think we left
off on you wanting

to strangle me
with my intestines.

So what's stopping you?

Let me guess...

I'm not like
the other girls.

You're fascinated,

intrigued,

maybe even... Attracted.

I, uh...

I have to go.

Hey, I got an idea.

I don't know
why I'm doing this.

Paper.

I have to go.

Are you gonna
get me some paper?

Paper.

She wants paper.

And I'm actually
getting it.

Pen?

A pen.

What good's paper
without a pen?

Pen.

First thing we need
is a bag.

A big bag.

Bag.

Now what?

Now, we need to fill it.


Ready?

Who's there?


(DOG BARKING)



KAYLIE: Come on.

You want some M&M's?
Sure.

That's not
candy-coated chocolate.

Mother's merriments.

But they do melt
in your mouth.

Oh, what are they for?

Nights like this.

Come on.

They'll make you
feel like a gummy bear.


You hear that?

What?

That's the sound
of the pumpkins
of this world

pissing themselves.

Yes.

Don't forget the...
Oh!

I got some big ideas
for this one.

No.

What is it?

This is Graham's house.

A friend?

A boy.

Oh, well,
we'll go next door.

No.

Oh!

Let's get him really bad.

No.

Just me.

This is his.

I always thought
it fit him just perfectly.

I don't know why.

My best friend Daphne
thinks he's beautiful.

She said she'd
never date him though,

because I saw him first.

I always saw him.

Do you ever talk to him?

Me?

What would I have to say?

"Hello. I exist."

I'm not even sure
I really do.

Hand me the bag.

Can I ask you
a question?

Sure.

Why didn't you
call the cops tonight?

What, you think
I was really scared
or something?

A little bit.

Do you know
why I sleep easy at night?

Why?

Freddy Krueger
doesn't haunt my dreams.

I haunt his.

Is that so?

Can I ask you
another question?

Maybe.

When you jumped
out of the window,

you acted like your knee
snapped backward,

but you've been
walking fine ever since.

Now I ask a question.

You didn't answer
my last question.

You answered it yourself.

Are you having
fun tonight?

It's not exactly going
as I planned.

What was your plan?

A friendly little game
of hide and seek

capped off with
a little game
of gut the girl?

Something like that.

You like gutting girls?

No comment.

You know what I like?

I like...

Booze.

The only thing
better than booze
is other people's booze.

Would you agree?

Oh, yeah. I'd agree.

(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)

(KAYLIE CHUCKLING)

Do you know why
geeky kids and outcasts
all love Halloween so much?

Why?

Well, it's the one day
of the year

the weirder you look,
the more likely you
are to get some sugar.

Okay, you know
why witches
can't have babies?

Why?

Because warlocks
have hallow-weenies.

Oh, God.

Uh-oh.

You're fucked up.

You know how I can tell?

Anything I say
will make you laugh.

Bullshit.

Knock knock.

For real.

Okay.

Okay.

Who's there?

Boo.

Yeah, you are good
and shit-faced.

Well, if you're not by now,

then you're some
kind of fucking animal.

Like a machine
or something.

How many times did you
swing that knife
at me and miss?

Is your aim
really that bad?

You know what I think?

I think the boogeyman
is just like any other man.

He knows what he wants,

he just doesn't
necessarily know
how to get it.

He chases the girl,
he catches her,

but if he kills her,

well, that's the end
of it all.

And that's not
what he wants.

He wants her.

And then the girl?

Hmm.

The sweet little
virginal girl,

the one...
None of the other boys
are interested in?

Until one night

this boy comes along,

different than
all the rest.

He takes
a different tact with her,

and she likes it.

He may frighten her,

but somewhere inside,
she knows that this...

This is right.

They're meant
for each other.

Wouldn't it be something if...
This was just the way it was,

every night,

bringing hell
to everyone
who has it coming,

which is pretty much
everyone.

You could
circle the country.

Mischief night,

every night,

everywhere.

That would be something.

But I wouldn't do it alone.

I've always had this
feeling inside of me,

all my life,

like an urge or a fever,

but I could never
put a finger on it.

And then one day,

one instance,

I was at home

putting my son to bed,

my little baby boy.

Beautiful.

My wife was beside me,

so happy.

My life ahead of me,
so good.

And it occurred to me then,

in that moment,

so... Benign

and pure,

you could put it
on your walls

next to your Norman Rockwell.

That... That feeling
that I'd had for so long

is anger.

Why such anger?

How do I rid myself
of this anger?

It was like an angry god
I had to please.

Murder.

Yeah.

And blood.

An innocent.

How (INHALES) it must feel

to wait and wait

till the time is right,

and then drive,

just... Drive.

Intuition will guide you.

The angry god
will lead you.

Some highway, some exit,

some town, some house.

You'll know it
when you see it.

Some girl.

You kill her
because you can.

And then... The angry god
will be pleased,

and you will know

what it is to feel satiated.

And your son

will grow to love
and honor you

'cause you're
a truly good man.

And your wife,

your wife will
always love you.

A truly good man.

And you will love yourself

because you did it.

You did it.

One night, long ago,
you did it.

But just once.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Turn out the light.

Come.

(QUILT RUSTLING)

Now stab me.
I want it to hurt.




You are so strange.

I'm sorry.

No.

I mean...

You're extraordinary.

Thanks.

You don't believe me.

I think I prefer strange.

Why?

That feels right.

Well, you are strange.

You're the strangest
fucking girl I've ever met.

That's the nicest thing
anybody has ever
said about me.

You were my first lover.

Do you want me
to be your first victim?

Where are you going?

I have to think.


This bitch
is going down.

CHUCK: Lonny,
are you sure
we should do this?

BRI: Yeah, it's not
even her house.

LONNY: Come on,
you pussies.


(GATE CREAKING)

Is that you, whore bag?

I'm coming for you.



We should go.

Are you a pussy?
Go check it out.

You check it out.

Fine. We both check it out.

Lonny? You there?

CHUCK: Hey,
if you're joking around,
it's not funny.

It's dark out here.
Someone could
trip and get hurt.



I'm sorry
if I upset you.

I didn't mean
to push you away.

I think we should talk.

What's the matter?

You don't look right.

I never should
have come.

I never should have
done this.

Any of this.

I have a home.
I have a family.

And we need paper towels
and low-fat milk.

This night never happened,
do you understand?

I understand.

Kaylie...

I like you.

I had a really
nice time tonight.

No, you didn't.

There was no tonight.

It never happened.

Midnight.

Happy Halloween.

Be careful on the road.
You had a lot to drink.

I don't want
you to think...
What?

I don't know.

(PHONE RINGING)

Would you mind
grabbing that for me
before you leave?

I don't really care
who it is, all right?

and I'm not exactly
in a talking mood,
you know what I mean?

(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

(DOOR SLAMS)

What am I doing?

Hello?

GRAHAM:  <i>Hi.</i>
<i>Hey. Mr. Payton?</i>

No, no.

He's not here right now.

Do you wanna
leave a message?

No, I'm actually
calling for Kaylie.
Who is this?

Uh, a friend.

<i>Oh!</i>

Okay, like a boyfriend?

No. Uh...

No, just a friend.

<i>Oh, okay. Cool.</i>

Uh, is she there?

Yeah, she's... She's in
the bathroom right now.

Right, okay.
Can you just let her know
that Graham called?

Graham?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, I can let her know
you called.

<i>Thanks, and tell her</i>
<i>I'm really sorry</i>
<i>about the prank,</i>

<i>it was a stupid prank.</i>

What prank?

Yeah, her friend Daphne
had this stupid idea

of making her think that
her and I were hooking up,

and then Daphne and me
were going to surprise her

because we're
actually not hooking up.

<i>I kind of like Kaylie,</i>

<i>and Daphne said</i>
<i>that Kaylie likes me and...</i>

I don't know.
It was just stupid, um...

By the way,
have you seen Daphne?
Has she come by?

Uh, no.

No, not that I know of.

Yeah, can you tell her
all of that... I'm sorry.

<i>You know, Graham,</i>

I think you
should come over
and tell her yourself.

You know what?
I think you are right.

Yeah.

All right,
happy Halloween.

<i>Yeah, you, too, buddy...</i>

Hey.

(CRUNCHING SOUND)

What did you do?


I don't know if there's
something in the air
or what.

Boy, this night
really does
something to you.

<i>Our scary little</i>
<i>game of cat and mouse</i>
<i>really turned me on.</i>

You think
you're the only one

who's had that urge
building up inside of you?

That necessity
to lash out?

<i>There's a killer</i>
<i>inside both of us.</i>

<i>The difference is,</i>
<i>I let mine out</i>
<i>to play tonight,</i>

<i>and you were</i>
<i>too big of a pussy</i>
<i>to make it happen.</i>

I only had one teeny-weeny,
little thread of sanity

keeping my sociopathic
tendencies in check

when, you know,
it was for
the love of a boy.

I thought me and
you had something.

I thought
we were the same.

It could have been
something...

Beautiful.


But I guess
we both got fucked tonight.

she'll be upset we were out
later than planned?

Oh, please,
with what I'm paying her?

She should give me a handy
on the way home.

Stanley, you're terrible.
Jesus Christ!


He was coming
for the baby.

(BABY CRYING)

STANLEY: Jesus Christ,
is he okay? Is he okay?

MRS. PAYTON: Yeah.
Yeah? Is he okay?

(SIREN WAILING)

MR. SMILEY: I warned them.

I told them.
I said, "Lock your doors.
Don't answer the door.

"There's strange things
happening here."

And I warned everyone.

I went to every house
and told them.

Devil's Night.

That's what they call it,
you know,

in foreign countries.

It's Devil's  <i>Nacht,</i>

the Devil's night.

It embodies the whole spirit
of what's going on tonight.

<i>I feel the spirit</i>
<i>of Halloween.</i>

<i>There's some</i>
<i>evil in the air.</i>

<i>"Mischief," it's just</i>
<i>a cutesy little word.</i>

<i>Mischief.</i>

COP: Move along, please.

MR. SMILEY:
<i>I consider it to be</i>
<i>a euphemism</i>

for nothing short of evil.

Okay. Right. Gotcha.

I...

I told them that
I was here earlier.

They want to ask some...
Questions.


He answered the phone.

He wanted me to come over.

It's all so unreal and...

I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

I feel so sick inside.

And here I am talking...

I can't even imagine
what you must have
gone through tonight.

I am so sorry.

Can I do anything?

Please don't leave me
alone tonight.


I don't want to be alone.


Okay, Kaylie.

I won't.

I won't leave you
alone tonight.

MAN: Speed, marker...
Action!

Hi! How you doing?


Are you cooking dinner?
That's a pot roast, right?

That smells good.

Is that dinner
for one or two?

Mmm, pot roast
or something?


My name's George.

You and your shotgun?

Whoa! I like that!
The NRA would be
happy with you!

You know, out here,
there are crazy people.

Gang initiations,
hoodlums, vandals,
hooligans, cults out here.

They sacrifice goats.

Somebody found
a sacrificial altar
with blood dripping on it.

The smell...


It's causing
a big problem here

with the house
prices and everything.

Are you familiar
with that kind of thing?

You know, sacrificial lambs?
Maybe goats?

I don't know.

We got a meth factory
down the street

that practically took
out a whole block here.

You would not believe.
The guy was a nice guy,

bank manager-type
or accountant or whatever.

He nearly blew up
the whole neighborhood.
You heard about that?

No. No, I didn't.

All the crazies are out,
the nutters are out.

There's so many nutters
out there,

I mean, it's crazy!

There's too many fruitcakes.
Seriously.

We got them all right here.

I mean, we caught
some kids, you know,
that were stealing bicycles.

They're not now!

Wow!

And we're really
close to the airport, too.
You can hear that, right?

I know, I know.

That's no good for us,
though, is it?

Mmm.
No, but we're gonna
keep going.

We're gonna keep
going because that jet,

it's gonna be
in fucking New York
any moment now.

So where the hell were we?
Oh, my God.

I can't believe
he's coming back now.

He must have done
a quick drop off
and he's coming back!

That's great.

Are you from the south?

No, I'm not. No.

Oh, from The Valley.
Close enough.

Listen, Kaylie rhymes
with Haley.

Kaylie...
Not really.

You're very cute,
Kaylie rhymes with Haley.

Because you
just never know...

(ENGINE ROARING)

See? Now that is not a...

That is speeding in this...
I mean, it's crazy.

It's crazy here.

You don't have
a little spy hole,
do you, in the door?

I wouldn't use it
even if I had one.

Why? Are you too short?

You're cute!
Enjoy your dinner.

What the fuck is that?

Jesus.


Marker.

Oh, mischief.

Mischief.

What is mischief?
Mischief, mischief...

Mischievous little guys,
you know, mischief,

mischief dressed
as what, punks?

Yeah. Little bastards.
Fuck me.

We've got a lot of
mischief over there
with that fucking thing.

I'll never get that line,
so I'll just make it up.

When I go round
to the store,
what do I see?

Crazy fucking people.
I don't know about you.

You must do. That's a...

(CAR HONKING)

I'm taking this medication.
It's really helping me.

I... I have a clarity.
It's unbelievable.

Good shit, man.
I'm really flying.

I think it's speed
or something.

I can recommend it.
Kaylie, Kaylie, yeah.

Haley and the Comets,
Bill Haley, remember him?

<i>Rock Around the Clock.</i>

Mischief. Mischief.
Sounds exactly
what it is, mischief.

By the way, you know,
take out your notebook,
take this down.

Take this down.
Take this down.

Devil's  <i>Nacht.</i>

It's a foreign thing,
I think European.

Romanian, that's
where Dracula was from.

I gotta take my medication
because, shit, man,
I'm coming down.

This is a bummer.

I'm starting to sweat.

I'm starting to, ooh,
you know, shake a bit.

Some pot roast.
Are you hungry?

I think I was walking
my dog.

Dog's name's Henry.
Cute little dog.

Romanian.
Thank you.

Hey, I'm not finished.
I gotta tell you...

I think I know
who did it.


And I'm not gonna
tell you!
