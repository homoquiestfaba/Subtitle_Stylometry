-(FILM CREW CHATTERING)

GEORGE CARLIN: Hmm.

Okay. I know how to start--
I want to start this.

-DIRECTOR:<i> We're rolling.</i>
-GEORGE:<i> Uh-- Oh, rolling.</i>

DIRECTOR: Yes.

Let's get in.

-DIRECTOR:<i> Okay.</i>
-GEORGE:<i> You're good?</i>

DIRECTOR:<i> Yep.</i>

One more time. And action.

Here's another
civic superstition

I have a problem with. "Rights."

Boy, everybody in this country
is always running around

yammering about their rights.

"I have a right."
"You have no right."

"We have a right."
"They don't have a right."

"The government has a right."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. fine.

Listen, folks,
I hate to spoil your fun,

but there's no such thing
as rights, okay?

We made them up.

They're imaginary, like
the boogeyman,

the three little pigs,
Pinocchio, stuff like that.

It's fictional.
Fictional idea, rights.

People say,
"Well, they come from God.

They're God-given rights."
Oh, fuck, here we go again.

The God excuse,

the last refuge of a man
with no answers and no argument.

"It came from God."

But let's say it's true.

Let's say it's true
that God gave us these rights.

Fine, why would he give us
a certain number of rights?

The Bill of Rights
in this country

has ten stipulations,
ten rights. And by the way,

God must have been doing
sloppy work

'cause we've had to amend
the Bill of Rights

an additional 17 times.

God left out
a few things, like...

slavery. Just fucking
overlooked it that day.

â™ª (INTENSE HIP-HOP BEAT

GEORGE:<i> Doesn't sound like</i>

<i>Sounds more like one group

In other words,
business as usual in the USA.

ANNOUNCER 1:
<i>Here's George Carlin.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2:<i> Legendary comedian</i>
<i>George Carlin.</i>

-George Carlin.
-Hey, baby, what's happening?

By far, you're easily

one of the greatest comedians
ever.

All I could think of was shit,
piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker,

-motherfucker, and tits, man.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

W. KAMAU BELL:
<i>Carlin changed comedy</i>

<i>three or four times
in his career.</i>

<i>And he still seems
to be talking to us.</i>

Pro-life conservatives
are obsessed with a fetus

from conception to nine months,

but once you're born,
you're on your own.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

KAMAU:
<i>Because George Carlin bits</i>

<i>are still being shared
on social media</i>

<i>"to go, "You don't understand
how rights work?</i>

<i>Look at this bit."</i>

"You don't understand
how privilege works?
Look at this bit."

GEORGE:<i> This country's</i>
<i>only 200 years old</i>

<i>and already
we've had ten major wars.</i>

<i>-So we're good at it!</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:
And it's a good thing we are.

We're not very good
at anything else anymore.

Got no steel industry left,
can't educate our young people,

can't get health care
to our old people,

but we can bomb the shit
out of your country, all right.

Comedy, traditionally,
has picked on people in power,

people who abuse their power.

I don't like orthodoxy
of the left

any more than I like orthodoxy
of the right.

<i>I don't like anyone trying
to control</i>

<i>the language and behavior
of people.</i>

<i>These moral commandos
who want us</i>

<i>to think their way</i>

<i>and want to change
what we can hear and see</i>

and think in this country
are dangerous.

It's called freedom of choice,

and it's one of the principles
this country was founded upon.

Look it up in the library,
Reverend,

if you have any of them left

when you finish burning
all the books.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

It's a big club,
and you ain't in it.

<i>People will say to me sometimes,</i>

<i>"Well,
what are you so angry about?"</i>

Has everybody lost
their fucking mind

-in this country?
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

GEORGE:
<i>What they think is anger</i>

<i>is a real contempt
for the choices</i>

<i>that my fellow humans have made.</i>

<i>I just feel betrayed</i>

<i>by the bullshit in America
that's all around us.</i>

<i>I call it the freak show.</i>

<i>When you're born
into this world, you're given</i>

<i>a ticket to the freak show.</i>

<i>When you are born in America,
you're given a front-row seat.</i>

â™ª (MUSIC FADES) â™ª

HOST:
<i>So, fasten your seat belts,</i>

<i>ladies and gentlemen,
get ready for Mr. George Carlin.</i>

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

There are thousands of comedians
in this country,

but basically,
only two types of humor.

There's the old school
and the new school.

I think we recognize them both.

The old school
is largely made up

of the fast-paced
stand-up comedians,

the one-liner comics

who came from vaudeville
and burlesque,

and they comprise
the insult school of humor.

Jack E. Leonard
is a good example of this.

(DEEP VOICE) "Thank you
very much, ladies and gentlemen."

I'd just like to say it's good

to be back
in New York this weekend.

It's a wonderful town.
Thank you very much.

You got some lovely girls here

compared to the last place
I worked.

Some of the broads there
were so ugly

that if you wanted
to pay 'em a compliment

you had to say, "How do you do?
I see your face cleared up."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> I began</i>
<i>with this very mainstream dream.</i>

<i>Fifth grade, 11 years old,</i>

<i>the autobiography,
the last page,</i>

<i>"What do you want to be," said,</i>

<i>"disc jockey, comedian, actor,
big success."</i>

<i>I didn't know
what this would lead to.</i>

<i>I only knew that I loved
standing up in front of people</i>

<i>and having their attention.</i>

I grew up in New York.
Whenever I'm back in town

I like to visit nostalgic places
from my childhood.

<i>I was from a neighborhood,
we called it White Harlem.</i>

<i>It was right next to Harlem
and Columbia University.</i>

<i>We called it White Harlem</i>

<i>because that sounded bad,
you know?</i>

The real name
was Morningside Heights.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

We had Columbia University
and Juilliard and two seminaries

-right near us.
-INTERVIEWER: Wow!

GEORGE:<i> I grew up</i>
<i>with a great respect</i>

<i>for knowledge and love of it,
you know, just thirst for it.</i>

<i>The neighborhood is very mixed.</i>

<i>Right next to the Spanish
and the Black ghetto,</i>

<i>Harlem,
and the lower-middle-class</i>

<i>Irish neighborhood
where I grew up.</i>

(NEW YORK ACCENT)
<i>This was the way the guys</i>
<i>in my neighborhood talked.</i>

This here is your
third-generation Irish voice.

All the cops in New York
have this voice, right?

You heard the voice. "Come on,
Johnny, move along here.

Come on, let's go.
Where you going, Johnny?"

They call everyone Johnny.
Notice that?

Even your mother, right?
"I'm his mother."

"Never mind, Johnny,
get off the corner there."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> My father,</i>
<i>whom I didn't know,</i>

<i>was gifted verbally.</i>

<i>He was a natural comedian</i>

<i>with a line of shit
that wouldn't quit.</i>

<i>He was an after-dinner speaker.</i>

<i>He won the Dale Carnegie
speakers contest,</i>

<i>over 600 and something
other entrants.</i>

<i>My mother could tell stories.
They both did character voices</i>

<i>when they would tell you
an anecdote,</i>

<i>so it was in the genes
and it was around the house.</i>

<i>And neither of them took
any shit from the world.</i>

<i>But he was a drinker
and he was a bully.</i>

<i>She called him a street angel
and a house devil.</i>

And she didn't want
to have happen to me

what happened to my brother.

<i>He was beaten.</i>

My mom says
that the sex was wonderful.

And the other part was horrible.

And he would lay in there, man.

And I would just grit my teeth
and think, you know,

"I hate you. I hate you."

So, one night
when she had fled from him

temporarily
to her father's house,

my grandfather
on 112th Street...

And we had to get out
of that house.

My father was trying
to batter the fucking door down.

She took me in her arms,
two months,

that's what she says,

he was five years old,
my brother.

She went out the window
onto the fire escape.

And my old man
was trying to tear

the fucking door off the hinges
and we jump into my uncle's car,

and he drives us up here
to the Catskills

where we hid out.

And we were vagabonds
for about two or three years

until she found an apartment

and we established a little--
she called it our little home.

<i>After their separation...</i>

<i>Catholics didn't get divorced.</i>

<i>They could,
but only the rich ones.</i>

<i>He died
when I was eight years old.</i>

<i>His first symptom
of heart disease</i>

<i>was a trip to the cemetery.</i>


ANNOUNCER:
<i>George Carlin reporting</i>

<i>the news at six o'clock.</i>

<i>Looks like we're about
to win the war after all.</i>

<i>A new bomb is quote-unquote
the XYZ Bomb.</i>

<i>It's a wonderful bomb and it can
blow up the whole world.</i>

GEORGE:
<i>I was growing up in World War II</i>

<i>and post-war New York City,
being raised by a single mother</i>

<i>who had a great gift
and love of language,</i>

<i>and who imparted that to me.</i>

<i>But I was alone in the house.
My mother had to work.</i>

Did you grow up feeling
deprived, lonely?

I didn't feel that. I was alone
a lot, but I enjoyed that.

Something in my makeup
accepted that and thrived on it.

<i>That was my family,

GEORGE:<i> I was attracted</i>
<i>to the comedians on radio,</i>

<i>Danny Kaye

<i>I just wanted

<i>That was his sickest game

We ran in a gang.

There was about ten,
11, 12 of us.

When I was a little boy
in New York City in the 1940s,

<i>-we swam in the Hudson River.</i>
-RANDY JURGENSEN:<i> And we
would swim in the Hudson River.</i>

GEORGE:<i> And it was filled</i>
<i>with raw sewage, okay?</i>

We swam in raw sewage,

-you know, to cool off.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

RANDY:<i> Police would patrol</i>
<i>the neighborhoods</i>

<i>for kids that got into trouble,</i>

and you'd get what they called
a juvenile delinquent card.

Thousands of kids died
from polio every year,

but you know something?
In my neighborhood,

no one ever got polio.
No one. Ever. You know why?

-'Cause we swam in raw sewage.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

We got caught,
and they stood us up on line.

It strengthened
our immune systems.

The polio never had a prayer,
we were tempered in raw shit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

I gave a name. I can't remember
what name I gave.

And then alongside of me,
there were two others,

and they gave false names.

Now,
George is fourth down the line,

and they say to George,
"What is your name?"

And he says, "Randy Jurgensen."

He gave-- He gave them--
He gave them my real name.

<i>That is the name of this job.</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Stoops like this
were my first real stage.

I wasn't very good at fighting.

My three talents were stealing,
lying, and entertaining.

I grew up with that

<i>I think I saw religion

<i>An act of spiritual communion...</i>

<i>I remember at First Communion,</i>

"You're gonna feel different."</i>

PRIEST:
<i>...and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

GEORGE:<i> "And you will be</i>
<i>in the state of grace,</i>"

<i>and you will feel
God's presence," and all this.</i>

<i>And I thought,
"None of that happened."</i>

<i>And I began to see

PRIEST:
<i>...attempted to lead me astray.</i>

GEORGE:<i> From then on, I really</i>

PRIEST:<i> Amen.</i>

GEORGE: (OVER RECORDING)
<i>Testing, testing, testing.</i>

<i>Testing, testing,
testing, testing. Testing.</i>

<i>My own experience of authority</i>

<i>is one of opposition to,
not just questioning authority,</i>

<i>but actively opposing it,</i>

<i>and trying to undo
what it had in mind.</i>

<i>Everything that had rules
and regulations,</i>

<i>I managed to either get kicked
out of or leave early on my own,</i>

<i>the choir, the altar boys,
the Boy Scouts,</i>

<i>summer camp, and schools.</i>

<i>I quit high school
in ninth grade,</i>

<i>and I was a pot smoker
when I was 13.</i>

<i>These were things
where I was saying,</i>

<i>"Your values suck."</i>

<i>I don't buy that authority
comes on a direct line from God</i>

<i>through my parents,
through my church people,</i>

<i>or the policemen or any of that.
All authority comes from within.</i>

<i>"All my power comes from within."</i>

PATRICK CARLIN:
<i>He was cool, and he was himself,</i>

but my mother
was clamping down on him.

And it was much tougher
for him

to break away from her
than me

because of her
wanting to hold on.

She said to him one time,

and I thought
it was so fucking sad,

but it's how people are,
she said,

"You made up for every bad thing
you ever did

when you became a star."

And I thought to myself,
"Well, I'm glad,

but goddamn it,
that's pretty fucking pathetic."

GEORGE:<i> I had a mother</i>
<i>who tried to control my life,</i>

<i>who had a plan for me.</i>

<i>"I'm going to make something
out of that boy."</i>

<i>And that's what repelled me
from her. It was this feeling,</i>

<i>"You are a reflection on me."</i>

<i>She was a drama queen
and a narcissist.</i>

<i>-"You'll pay someday, mister..."</i>
-(BANGING ON TABLE)

<i>"You'll pay for
what you have done to me."</i>

<i>You have let me down,

<i>"You are out of my life."</i>

<i>I loved her for her toughness,</i>

<i>but George had to get away
because she would stifle him.</i>

<i>She would have sucked the blood
right out of him.</i>

<i>So he said the minute
he was 17, he was going.</i>

And he sent me
a little manila folder.

Just a small one,

a little bigger
than a Christmas card.

And he wrote on it in a marker,

"For those days when everything
has got you down."

And when you open it up,

there was a photo
of my father's gravestone.


Ain't that beautiful?

<i>George fascinated me.
He was so different than I was.</i>

<i>-He was from Manhattan.</i>
-INTERVIEWER:<i> Uh-huh.</i>

BRENDA:<i> And street gangs,</i>
<i>and</i> West Side Story,

<i>and all of this stuff.</i>

<i>He started calling me,
and I started calling him.</i>

<i>And then the letters
went back and forth.</i>

â™ª (SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

<i>I knew we had a relationship
and something very special.</i>

<i>But I also knew that George
was just starting his career.</i>

<i>And I was trying to be very
adult about the relationship.</i>

All of a sudden,
he walked in the club,

and I mean,
it was just, you know,

the music,
where the violins started,

and we ran into each
other's arms. (CHUCKLES)

<i>And I say five weeks.
George says seven weeks,</i>

<i>maximum that we knew each other,</i>

<i>being together
before we got married.</i>

<i>And I immediately
stopped working</i>

with George.</i>

JACK:<i> Good evening,</i>

GEORGE:<i> Jack Burns and I</i>

KELLY CARLIN:<i> My mother</i>
<i>was his biggest champion.</i>

<i>She could see the power
of other people.</i>

She just had a real way
of lifting people up

and believing in them.

And I can only imagine
this young comic

knowing that he had all
the potential in the world,

he really believed in himself,

and then to have a woman
come into his life and say,

"I'm on your team.
We're gonna do this together."

<i>They were comrades in arms.</i>

KELLY:<i> They were really cute</i>

GEORGE:<i> I said, "I've got to</i>

<i>I've got to do television here.
I have to figure this out."</i>

<i>There were no comedy clubs.
There were only coffee houses.</i>

<i>Coffee houses had hootenannies,</i>

<i>and they had an open mic
amateur night.</i>

INTERVIEWER:<i> And you developed</i>
<i>a lot of your own single stuff</i>

<i>at the Cafe Au Go Go, was it?</i>

Down in Greenwich Village.
Yeah, I got tired of going out

to Indianapolis and Detroit
and St. Louis for one week,

and not having anything
to show for it.

You spend all your money
traveling.

So I decided to stay
in New York for a year,

and work at one club

where I could develop
my style and my material.

And it happened
in Greenwich Village

at the Go Go.
This is the theater

where I first did television
for Merv Griffin,

-where it really began.
-INTERVIEWER: Right.

The Indian Sergeant
was the first character.

He used to work with a partner,
and now, he's on his own.

Another of television's

the kind of talent
always welcome around here.

Would you all meet
young George Carlin. George?

-â™ª (BAND MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Uh...
I've been watching the Westerns.

All of us have been watching
Western movies,

an endless stream of them,
for our entire lives,

and I've noticed something
about them.

When the Westerns
involve Indians,

and sometimes they don't,
sometimes it's Brian Donlevy

with a black hat
and a crooked card game.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But when they involved Indians,

the big scene always seems to be

when the Indians
finally attack the cowboys.

<i>You always see
exactly how the cowboys prepare</i>

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

<i>I found out

Right now, we're sending it out

-Happy 35th birthday, Linda.

GEORGE:<i> I did the disc jockey.</i>

It's a brand new one.
It's called,

"Your face cleared up."

<i>Then I did a newscast,

<i>Again, demonstrations
and protests dominate
the headlines.</i>

The draft card burners
are at it again.

Not content with burning
their individual draft cards,

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

I saw him early.

he was sparkling.

-HOST: How you feel?
-(EXAGGERATED ACCENT) Wonderful.
I'll tell you one thing.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-What I said was good?
-HOST: Very good, yes.

ROBERT KLEIN:
<i>He was likeable immediately.</i>

HOST:
I could talk like that too.

-GEORGE: Can you?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And I think that George Carlin
is one of two autodidacts

in American comedy,
that is to say,

people who are self-taught,
George and Groucho Marx.

<i>I think George proved
in many ways</i>

<i>how intelligent he was,</i>

<i>and how interested he was
in the world around him.</i>

I really haven't been
to the movies

in an awfully long time.

I think the last movie I saw
was<i> West Side Story,</i>

and I was really disappointed
with that

because I'm from the West Side,

and I understood these kids
were supposed to be tough

in the movie. I mean,
two people get killed

in the movie.
They should be tough kids,

like that.

We've got some wonderful guests

So, let's meet them, huh?
George Carlin.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

JOHN DAVIDSON: Jackie and Gayle.

The Lively Set.

And our guest,
Mr. Richard Pryor.

Ladies and gentlemen,
you've met our two comedians,

George Carlin and Richard Pryor.

-That's right.
-Guys,

earlier, when you were doing
your routines,

at first I was watching you,

-like a nice guy.
-Yeah, yeah.

And then I found
that it was much more fun

to watch the audience.

-The audience?
-Watch the audience?

-Yes.
-While we're working?

Should we leave now,
Richie, man? Let's go.

-No.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

What I mean is I found
it was much more fun

to watch the audience,

because you can see
the different ways

that people laugh.

-Have you ever noticed that?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

You must notice
that in the nightclubs, right?

Yeah, well, I have always

-noticed 'em and I have...
-Oh yeah, I do. What?

You go ahead
and I'll watch the audience.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Well, uh, first of all,

there's the neat,
precise laugher.

Have you seen him.
It's like... (CHUCKLES)

He's really breaking up,
just the way accountants laugh.

They like to keep it neat.

-(LAUGHS RESTRAINEDLY)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

I once worked a whole
convention of accountants.

-(LAUGHS FAINTLY)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Kind of strange.

Richard, what's your
favorite kind of laughter?

Well, I got a laugh.
I don't know

if it's my favorite,
but it's one I hear

above everyone else's,
sort of a witch's laugh

-(CACKLES)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-Kind of scares you... (CACKLES)
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

But I've never worked for
a convention of witches.

(LAUGHS EXAGGERATEDLY)
Hey, look at that.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Good evening. Once again,

the big hand is on the five,
the little hand is on the six,

and it's time
for the 11 o'clock report.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-First of all, the headlines.

Russia and the United States
are at war.

Missiles have been fired
by both sides.

Moscow, New York, and London
are in flames.

Details on these
and other stories

in just a moment
after the report.

KLIPH:<i> In the 1960s,</i>
<i>one of the main genres</i>

<i>-of television...</i>
-Hello?

-Kraft Summer Music Hall.
<i>-...was the variety show.</i>

<i>I'm sure in the greenroom</i>

<i>and after work,
they probably had a lot of fun</i>

<i>smoking joints together,</i>

but they could not be subversive
on the show

if they had wanted to be.

...to Al Sleet,
the hippie-dippy weatherman.

-"Hey, baby, what's happening?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And, so, we always talk
about fascist politicians

speaking
with a dog whistle sentence.

George Carlin had
these dog whistles for hippies.

Al Sleet here,
your hippie-dippy weatherman

with all
the hippie-dippy weather.

KLIPH:<i> Just that voice</i>
<i>is the voice of a guy</i>

<i>who has taken a huge bong hit.</i>

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-One, two, three, four, five.

If your parents were watching
that on Ed Sullivan

or Perry Como,
they don't know that,

but the kids know that.
They're like,

"He is stoned. This character
is stoned. He's high."

Now, if you take a look
at our weather map over...

-...here,

you'll notice
that this warm front extends

I think
when we came out here in 1966.

INTERVIEWER: And what happened?

It was the John Davidson
the<i> Kraft Summer Music Hall.</i>

What happens to your lifestyle?
How does it change?

I think it...

Well, it affected me very badly
because I felt abandoned.

-INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh.
-He came out to a show,

and even though they would have
parties and get-togethers

to involve the wives,
and you know,

husbands or whatever,
I really felt abandoned.

I didn't really know people
out here,

and this is a big city.

And I think
I was very restless also.

-I wanted to do something.
-INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.

But I didn't know
what I wanted to do,

and I turned to alcohol.

â™ª (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

KELLY:<i> We moved out to L.A.</i>

<i>And suddenly,
my dad has an agent,</i>

<i>he has a manager,
he has a press agent.</i>

And all the jobs my mom had
were gone.

<i>Suddenly,
her opinion doesn't matter.</i>

<i>And she really wanted to work,
but my dad would not let her.</i>

<i>Because he didn't want me
being a latchkey kid,</i>

<i>so he forbade my mother
from getting a job.</i>

<i>That really screwed
with her self-identity</i>

<i>and her ability to feel useful
in the world.</i>

<i>And he's on the road now,</i>

<i>sometimes three,
four, five weeks at a time.</i>

<i>And that's what a lot
of the arguing was about,</i>

<i>you know, the resentment she had
about that,</i>

<i>of being a stay-at-home mom.</i>

And she's feeling very left out
and left behind,

and very silenced by it all.

<i>So my mom drank,</i>

<i>and she became very loud
and exhibitionist in public.</i>

<i>And then my parents
had knock-down, drag-out fights</i>

<i>over my mom's drinking.</i>

And when you're having
those kind of episodes at home,

I mean, talk to most any...

it's a very secretive thing.

GEORGE:<i> And now,</i>
<i>here's Kelly Carlin</i>

<i>â™ª When the bough breaks down</i>
<i>The cradle will fall â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> And down will come baby â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Cradle And all â™ª</i>

KELLY:<i> Goodbye.</i>

GEORGE:<i> At that time</i>
<i>in my career I felt</i>

<i>that by being a mainstream comic</i>

<i>and taking the steps
along the mainstream path...</i>

Yes, is a good part.
Is the best part I ever got you.

<i>...that would lead me
to this dream</i>

<i>I had of being a movie actor
like Danny Kaye.</i>

Anyway, I'm not up for the part.
I'm up for the understudy.

After your friend falls out
the window here, sweetheart,

you'll be up for the part.

<i>What I found was
I wasn't an actor.</i>

Well, we're just about to close,
but for you,

tell me what it is you like,
and I'll see to it personally.

<i>I had no technique
to fall back on,</i>

<i>I had no training

<i>I had only this idea
that this is my birthright.</i>

Well, I hope you know

it's full price for everything.

<i>I was a victim

<i>I was missing who I was.</i>

â™ª<i> When I was 17 â™ª</i>

<i>I began to take some acid

The one thing that I always
liked about George's story

is that he was a guy
who was in search

of his comedic voice.

So, like, I remember
hearing the stories

about, like, when he first
starts out, he's like, you know,

comedy team, and then
hippie-dippy weatherman.

And at some point, he's, like,
watching the culture shift,

and he's seeing the people
he's performing for,

and he's in tuxedos, and a suit,
and a tie,

and he's like,
"I wanna be over there

where the culture's shifting,
where things are happening."

<i>The message that I got
from Carlin is, like,</i>

<i>how do you wanna be funny</i>

<i>and who
do you wanna be funny for?</i>

I'm Oker Van Sander.

Back in that year

when all the guys were running
for the Democratic thing.

Pat Paulson was running,

I mean, every motherfucker

was running for pres.

<i>So, we smoke a whole lot

<i>And he came in

PATRICK: Councilman,

do you think we can solve
the problems of the cities?

You and me?

Oh, well,
the people in the country

can't solve the problems
in the cities.

If the people from the country
would stop moving

to the city,
that would solve the problem.

But that's the kind of balls
this guy had.

He'd bring a fucking

-PATRICK: You mean the...

That's what I mean,
the war in the streets

and the crime in Vietnam.

â™ª (PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

<i>I remember
being very constricted.</i>

<i>The fact
that I intellectually knew</i>

<i>there was an anal,
uptight world out there,</i>

<i>and I didn't feel like
I was part of it,</i>

<i>didn't erase the fact</i>

<i>that I was a living,
breathing example of it.</i>

Hi, George Carlin,
for Ozark Airlines.

Let's take a closer look
at Ozark.

<i>One of the tricks
I learned as a child</i>

<i>was to deny my feelings.
It saved my life probably.</i>

<i>To work with my left brain,
think my way through things,</i>

<i>push the feelings down.</i>

<i>But I was a traitor,
and I was living a real lie</i>

<i>because I wanted to say
so many different things.</i>

<i>What happened that changed
everything was acid.</i>

KELLY:<i> One day, he dropped acid.</i>

<i>We go into the bedroom, and he
was taking pictures of himself.</i>

And he had smashed his fist
into them to the point

<i>where he had made
his hands bleed,</i>

<i>and there was blood everywhere,</i>

<i>and he's crying.
And I don't think</i>

<i>I'd ever seen my dad cry
until that moment.</i>

<i>We sat on him for, like,
45 minutes</i>

<i>until he finally fell asleep.
Really, very, very scary.</i>

<i>I think he was having
a real battle within himself.</i>

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

KELLY:
<i>Which George is gonna win?</i>

<i>...the hippie-dippy weatherman,
George Carlin.</i>

BETTE MIDLER:
<i>It was Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,</i>

<i>and it was Squaresville.</i>

<i>I was George's opening act.</i>

And that night, he decided

he was gonna try out
some new material.

I guess he had been
working up to this.

Uh, that he didn't wanna be
that George Carlin anymore.

He wanted
to be a different George Carlin.

GEORGE:<i> I see Mohammed Ali</i>
<i>is fighting again.</i>

<i>That's kind of nice.</i>

<i>They really screwed him
out of his job</i>

<i>for three years, you know?</i>

Well, the people who...

...were in the audience,

I guess, they didn't think
that was so funny.

GEORGE:
<i>Sure, it was a spiteful move.</i>

<i>All because he didn't wanna go
to Vietnam, right?</i>

They took such offense
that they started walking out.

And they started walking out
in droves.

I'd never seen anything like it.

GEORGE:<i> There's a lot</i>
<i>of sexual connotation, too,</i>

<i>with Vietnam.
Do you notice that?</i>

<i>Always talking
about pulling out.</i>

<i>They were yelling things like,
"You've never been shot at.</i>

<i>How do you know anything
about Vietnam?"</i>

<i>And then they were asking
for my room number.</i>

<i>The hotel had to send me
a telegram</i>

<i>saying, "We cannot guarantee
your safety."</i>

<i>"We suggest you leave."</i>

BETTE:<i> It felt like</i>
<i>a leap into the unknown.</i>

For the whole experience
of being with him.

Seeing someone do that.

Seeing someone decide,
and go for it.

It was life-altering for me.

<i>Sure, it's nice

<i>-but that other shit... Man!</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:
<i>And I used the word "shit."</i>

<i>I don't usually say shit.</i>

<i>I smoke it,
but I don't usually say it.</i>

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-GEORGE:<i> They fired me for that.</i>

<i>I don't mind saying it.

<i>You know, it's not a bad word.</i>

<i>That's the way to be free, man.</i>

<i>My wife and I had a home

And I went to her, you know?
And I said,

"We got a problem, Brenda.

I got fired, and this, and that,
and everything."

I said,
"I got to go to the colleges."

I said, "I belong
at the college concerts.

I belong with people
who are open

and will let me be myself
and experiment."

And she said,

"I'll make your press kit
for you."

<i>I, um, got to check what time...</i>

<i>I got fired in Las Vegas
for saying "shit."</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> In a town</i>
<i>where the big game</i>

<i>is called crap.</i>

<i>It's not fair, you know?</i>

<i>"There were guys in the casinos
saying, "Oh, shit.</i>

<i>I crapped again.
Look at that. Oh, goddamn."</i>

<i>Fired me.</i>

PATTON OSWALT:
<i>Carlin's transformation</i>

<i>wasn't a transformation.</i>

HOST: Mystery challenger,
will you enter

and sign in, please.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

PATTON:<i> If anything,</i>
<i>the Carlin that was on stage</i>

<i>in the tux and the clean-shaven</i>

<i>was a persona that he had put on</i>

<i>because that is what you did
in showbiz at the time.</i>

<i>It's like he de-transformed
into who he actually was.</i>

<i>And that's that great moment</i>

that every comedian
wants to get to.

You know, it took me a long time
to get to it, where the person

that you are offstage
is who you are onstage.

I understand you've got
a new image now, George,

besides a new beard.

Well, it comes out
as a new image.

Actually, I just have kind
of relaxed a little bit.

I found myself kind of caught up
in the suit and tie

establishment comedian thing,

and I really didn't enjoy it
as much as I thought I would.

So I wanted to get back
to the earth,

as it were, you know,
I'm just going to coffee houses

and colleges now.
And trying to be myself,

and instead of doing
little bits, and hunks,

and characters,
I'm just doing a monologue,

and talking about me
and the world, and what I see.

And it's more fun for me.
I feel a lot looser.

HOST:
<i>What's with the beard?</i>

GEORGE:<i> I don't know.</i>
<i>I just felt like having one.</i>

<i>I wanted to look
a little different</i>

<i>from the people that voted
for Nixon, you know? And I--</i>

(GUEST LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> You can't mistake me</i>
<i>for a Nixon voter now,</i>

<i>-I'll tell you that, right?</i>
-HOST:<i> Mm-mm.</i>

<i>I like to get in on the subjects
that are really happening,</i>

<i>I mean,
things that are determining</i>

<i>whether we're gonna live
or die, those are important.</i>

I used to be this guy.
I liked him, you know?

He was really good,
he was funny,

I had a lot of fun with him,
he did some nice things for me.

But there was nothing
behind him, you know?

He was just kind
of just superficial.

I was always doing ladies
on quiz shows,

or newsmen, or disc jockeys,

and I was hiding
behind these things.

I didn't know it consciously,
but television rewarded that.

See, that's one facet
of my comedy is I am a mimic.

Was there a lot of pressure,

I mean,
just to become yourself, and...

Oh. Well, I was ready for that.
That was one thing,

is I wasn't in my act anymore.

That was not--

The reason I went into this,
as anyone knows,

you go into this
as a self-expression.

-Of course.
-And once you're not doing that,

forget it.
So, I discovered that.

I was free then,
I was free to change.

"How long ago
did you get started on drugs?"

-"I forgot, man."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

That's why even though
marijuana's going to make it,

it's having trouble
being decriminalized

because a lot of guys
can't remember

where they left the petitions,
you know? It's a...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Hey, man.

When he got fired in Las Vegas,
he was making 250,000 a year.

First year with me,
he made 12,000 dollars.

We played the Hungry Eye,
we played the Troubadour,

<i>all the small little
hippie clubs.</i>

<i>Mary Jane,
nobody ever says Mary Jane.</i>

It's in all the dictionaries
for pot.

No one ever says it.
"Hey, got any Mary Jane?"

Does it get you high?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JEFF WALD:
<i>You know, he liked money,</i>
<i>he liked spending it,</i>

<i>but the money was not
the be everything to him.</i>

<i>His work was, you know?</i>

<i>His writing, his ability
to put his ideas out there.</i>

GEORGE:<i> Hey, thank you, all.</i>
<i>Remember, it takes two fingers</i>

<i>to make the peace sign
just like it takes</i>

<i>two people to make love.
When you go like this,</i>

<i>you're jerking off. Goodnight.</i>

<i>See you later, gang.
Thank you so much.</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

And you're not asking me
this question,

but I'm gonna jump to it
right now,

is that he's the Beatles
of comedy.

At a certain point
in his career,

there's this huge shift.
You know, he's doing

the comedic version
of "Love Me Do"

for the first part
of his career,

and then suddenly,

he fucking puts out
the comedic White Album.

Like, you know,
he does this huge turn.

He has this almost
spiritual transformation.

Being a class clown,
I was a good imitator.

I had a good ear,
and I could imitate. And, uh,

I imitated Father Byrne...

STEPHEN COLBERT:
<i>And I'm a Catholic.</i>

...because he was the celebrant

-of the nine o'clock mass.
-STEPHEN:<i> And I'm still</i>
<i>a Catholic.</i>

<i>And to have Carlin
making jokes about prayer,</i>

it was almost like
the first time

I ever went snorkeling. I went,

"Wait, there's a whole
other world down here

that I didn't know about?"
That was like,

Carlin gave me
the comedy snorkel.

And I went, "Oh, I can look
at my own faith this way, too?"

And that's something
I didn't have

before listening to him.

'Cause that's what they
taught us,

that it was what was
in your mind that counted,

what you made up,
your intentions,

that's what He
will judge you by.

A mortal sin
had to be a grievous offense,

sufficient reflection,
and full consent of the will.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You had to wanna.

In fact, "wanna" was a sin
all by itself, man.

"Thou shalt not wanna."

If you woke up in the morning,
and you said,

"I'm going downtown
and commit me a mortal sin."

Save your carfare,
you did it already, man.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

It's like the Justice Department
gets Black Panthers

and people on the Left, man,
for conspiracy.

"Did they do it?"
"No, but they wanted to.

-Get them in here." Yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Conspiracy. "I wanted to."

on prescription, right?</i>

<i>You still need a note</i>
<i>to get laid.</i> (EXHALES)

<i>Ladies must feel silly going in,
"Here's my note."</i>

GEORGE:<i> "Oh, that's what</i>
<i>you're doing at home, eh?</i>"

<i>Well, we're keeping a record
of it here in the store."</i>

<i>Well, someday
birth control pills</i>

<i>will come off prescription.</i>

<i>They'll have those catchy names
that patent medicines have.</i>

If we put the statue of Jesus

on the dashboard,
we got him facing us

instead of looking

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JON STEWART:<i> What I always</i>
<i>found amazing about Carlin</i>

was he would treat farting

with the same level of scrutiny,
and language, and deconstruction

as he would the pope,

the Catholic Church hierarchy,
the war machine.

He's a good guy. We always say,
"He's like you and me."

We always say-- A lot of
religions have taught us that.

Love God, love your neighbor,
love yourself,

'cause you're all
the same person.

And if God is like us,
big trouble, gang.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JON:<i> And for a kid...</i>

-GEORGE:<i> Farting is, uh...</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JON:<i> ...I didn't understand</i>
<i>that in any way.</i>

GEORGE:<i> Kids like it</i>
<i>'cause it's kinda like</i>

<i>shit without the mess, you know?</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But side-cheek-lift-up-fart?
(BLOW KISS) Man!

GEORGE:<i> Nixon is a perfect</i>
<i>symbol for this country.</i>

<i>He looks like he hasn't taken
a shit in a month.</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Hey, they're letting Ali fight.
He happened to lose,

but at least they're letting him
work again, right?

For three years, the cat
couldn't work, Muhammad Ali.

And, of course,
he had an unusual job,

-beating people up, you know?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:
But the government wanted him
to change jobs.

The government
wanted him to kill people.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And he said, "No,
that's where I draw the line."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

"I'll beat them up, but I don't
want to kill them, you know?"


And the government got spiteful.
They said,

"Look, if you won't kill them,
we won't let you beat them up."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Everyone remembers the reason
we're in Southeast Asia

is to free these people,
to bring them industry.

Isn't that roughly
our job everywhere?

We kind of free people
and whip industry on them

so that they can have all
the benefits of industry that...

...we have come to love.

<i>the United States had
what they called obscenity laws.</i>

It was literally illegal
to "be obscene"

in any public forum,

<i>and comedians
routinely got arrested.</i>

GEORGE:
<i>Sometimes they say "shoot."</i>

KLIPH:
<i>But obscenity laws were changing</i>

<i>all throughout the late '60s
and early '70s.</i>

GEORGE:
<i>"Shoot" is "shit" with two Os.</i>

KLIPH:<i> Little David Records</i>
<i>was founded</i>

<i>right at that same time</i>

<i>by another comedian
named Flip Wilson.</i>

Yes. Here's George's new album
<i>FM & AM.</i>

And Flip Wilson's whole purpose
with this new label

was to hire comedians
to do their act, no censorship.

This was an opportunity
for George to feel freer

as an artist.
And for me to be a part of...

maybe in some way helping a guy
that I admire.

And this is all the material
that you at home suspected

that this guy with long hair
probably had in his heart,

but was not able to do

And I started
memorizing the album.

So it was just embedded.

Well, first of all,
who doesn't want to hear

bad words when you're a kid?
That's the greatest.

You're already
on perfectly solid ground

if you're saying "fuck" in front
of a ten-year-old.

GEORGE:<i> Class clown used to save</i>
<i>his best stuff for lunchtime</i>

<i>when you were drinking
your milk...</i>

ALEX WINTER: Class Clown
<i>was an indoctrination,</i>

<i>you know, to get that album...</i>

GEORGE:<i> ...trying to make</i>
<i>the milk come out your nose.</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

ALEX:<i> He was cool, and funny,</i>
<i>and hip, but he kind of spoke</i>

<i>to issues in a way
that didn't feel</i>

<i>like eating your vegetables.</i>

And that was what first
struck me about Carlin

when I was young, was that
he was funny, he was smart,

he was human, he was open,
he was opinionated,

he was curious,

he was political,
he was sexual, he was human.

And he was just so cool,

you know? He was way cooler
than everybody else.

He was just...
You felt connected to him.

You liked him.

JERRY SEINFELD:<i> He personified</i>
<i>that thing that you see</i>

<i>"when you're young
and you go, "That's it.</i>

<i>That's the thing.
That's the thing to be."</i>

And I wanted
to be just like him,

getting every word
in the right spot.

Because when he did it,
it thrilled me, you know?

And I wanted to do that.
I wanted that skill.

And I've spent my life
pursuing it.

Listen, last time
you were on the show,

we got on a subject,
and we ran out of time.

You were talking about words.

GEORGE: Those are my babies.

Just take a simple thing
like the word "alter."

Alter and change

are supposed to mean
the same thing.

You can alter your plans,
you can change your plans,

and you've done the same thing.
But if you alter your pants

-and you change your pants...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> Just want to share</i>
<i>a few words with you</i>

<i>that amuse me,</i>

and combinations of words
like "occasional irregularity."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-What other kind can there be?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

If it were frequent,
it would be regularity.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

We got things like jumbo shrimp.

I stare at that a long time
on the menu.

-Jumbo... shrimp.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

"Jumbo shrimp." And he'd
get that really... (GRUNTS)

And he did all the way up
to the highs and the low.

And even
in that little punchline,

the ride that he took you on.

Is it a large shrimp
or is it a little jumbo?

BILL BURR:<i> How interesting</i>
<i>just sonically...</i>

Those words don't even
go together.

BILL:<i> ...he was as a comedian.</i>

It's like military intelligence.

How did they ever get
those two together?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Been looking at that one
a long time. They got more.

BILL:<i> The mastery that he had</i>
<i>of dynamics</i>

in volume,
and where he had the mic,

and bringing his voice up,
and bringing it down,

he had an incredible

<i>My mother raised

PAUL REISER:<i> So,</i>
<i>when I was in high school,</i>

<i>my older sister was in college</i>

and had a radio show,

and somehow
had gotten to George,

<i>and he agreed to be interviewed
for the radio show.</i>

GEORGE:<i> And so</i>
<i>I learned to be independent</i>

<i>in order to amuse myself.
And all those qualities</i>

<i>that have stuck
through all my life</i>

<i>were probably formed
by that necessity.</i>

I remember opening the door
to that apartment

on the Lower East Side
of Manhattan.

And I remember hearing
the toilet flush. I went,

"George Carlin just peed
at my house.

I'm a-- What a lucky guy."

INTERVIEWER:<i> There's nothing</i>
<i>that you'd rather be doing now?</i>

GEORGE:<i> Absolutely nothing.</i>

<i>My job is to think up amusing,
ironic, and absurd things,</i>

<i>which I have fun thinking up.</i>

<i>And then because
I'm a word freak and love that,</i>

<i>I get a chance to transform them
into the best possible words.</i>

<i>And then because I'm a hambone,
I get to stand up</i>

<i>and try to present them.</i>

<i>And what more could you ask for</i>

<i>than to share fun and funniness
with people, you know?</i>

<i>But it's growth, you know?
It's always growth.</i>

<i>And all I ever wanna know
is that I'm getting better,</i>

<i>that I'm doing things better,
thinking of more lines,</i>

<i>cutting and editing better.</i>

<i>Move upward, man,
you move onward.</i>

REISER:
<i>Now, he's ready to leave.</i>

<i>My father says,
"Where are you going?"</i>

He says, "I got to go Midtown."
"Why?"

He says,
"I got to buy a camera."

My father says,
"Don't go up there.

I got a place downtown.
I'll take you to these guys.

Murray and Saul,
you'll get the best..."

Takes him in the car.
Now, we're in my family's car.

We're all in the car.

George is in the seat
next to my father.

My father is driving.
A year later,

my sister does
a follow-up interview.

Poor guy, he does a follow-up.

It's almost like
that classic joke.

"I don't know
if you remember us."

And he says,
"Oh, I absolutely..."

That was
the strangest interview.

All I know is
I was on my way uptown

to score some coke...

"and next thing,
I'm buying a camera."

GEORGE:<i> It's true that along</i>
<i>with all the other shit</i>

<i>that came from drugs, some
of these brilliant motherfuckers</i>

<i>said some things
that weren't so cool.</i>

<i>For instance,
Napoleon is known to have said,</i>

<i>"Let's take everything

<i>and look at it."</i>

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> The drug problem</i>
<i>seems to be</i>

<i>that nobody will really define
what the drug problem is.</i>

To a lot of people,
the drug problem is,

-"I can't get any."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> You know, nobody knows</i>
<i>that we're all part of it,</i>

<i>that everybody in the country is

REPORTER:<i> The adult world</i>

GEORGE:<i> The drug companies</i>

<i>We've been searching for it
all our lives as humans</i>

<i>ever since

People say, "We have
a drug problem in this country."

"Where do you hear that?"
"At the drugstore."

Every three or four blocks,
big sign, "Drugs."

<i>Of course,
you have a drug problem</i>

<i>if they have stores for it.
Someone's got to abuse it.</i>

And then there are drugs
we don't even talk about.

Forgetting alcohol and tobacco,
which is the greatest part

of the hypocrisy
because they're used and abused

more than anything,
and they're legal,

and the government
lives on them.

Forgetting that part
of the hypocrisy,

there's a lot of other
little middle-class drug trips.

HOST 1:<i> Would you welcome,</i>

Is it true you've given up
drinking and smoking, George?

Yeah. Brenda has all the vices
in the family now.

-I've doubled up for his sake.
-(HOST 1 GROANING)

No, I think
all I need is fruit juice,

-and you're okay.

Well, I don't know.
That's probably the safest

Do you speak as an authority
on marijuana?

-I grew up in a neighborhood--
-HOST 2: You don't want to

-get him arrested on the show.
-You can only be arrested--

I don't have any or anything

it's really quite safe.

With fruit juice?

-Fruit juice especially.
-(HOST 1 CHUCKLING)

You have a daughter.
As she gets older,

what are you going to tell her?

BRENDA: I would hope,
if she gets involved

in any kind of drugs,
that marijuana

would be the thing that would
happen to her, you know?

I think we could explain that
to her

and possibly talk her out of it,
but I'm...

Oh, my God.
My mom and that fucking hair.

Amazing.
And my mom is loaded there.

Totally. That's a loaded mom.

-GEORGE:
The big thing is if she sees...
-I don't... You know?

...a truthful attitude
around the home about marijuana,

'cause she's gonna know
from her school chums.

And if she sees that
we're being truthful about one,

perhaps she'll trust us then.

KELLY:<i> The fact</i>
<i>that they talked about that,</i>

America did not talk about that.

Because it's going to be part
of her life.

It's gonna be part of the future
of this country,

just as all drugs are.
The drug industry

has us taking things
to get awake,

things to go to sleep,
things to pep up,

things to forget about the grief
you had from something.

It's part of our culture.
We are a drug-oriented society.

We should be used to it.
And I want her to know

-which things are dangerous
and which aren't.
-HOST 2: Hmm.

KELLY:<i> When my dad</i>
<i>made the change</i>

<i>We're gonna do this together."</i>

<i>But then what happened,

<i>As you grow up,</i>

-Except in Milwaukee.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:<i> Now,</i>
<i>they must really be bad words.</i>

One policeman took exception.
"He can't say that!"

he hadn't been listening

in the locker room
to the other guys talking.

<i>Those are the words
that will infect your mind,</i>

<i>curve your spine, and lose
the war for the allies, man.</i>

KELLY:<i> During the summertime,</i>

<i>Mom and I
would go on the road with him.</i>

<i>So, I'm backstage,</i>

"The cops are here.

They're not liking the language
that's coming from the stage,

and they're going
to arrest George."

<i>And my mom knows that my dad</i>

<i>is carrying weed and coke
in his pockets.</i>

She grabbed a glass of water
and walked out onto the stage,

<i>whispering in his ear,
"Cops are here."</i>

GEORGE:<i> Okay, cool.</i>
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

KELLY:<i> "Exit stage left."</i>

GEORGE:<i> Oh, that's not</i>
<i>what she told me.</i>

<i>She told me I had to split soon.</i>

KELLY:<i> He leaves the stage,</i>
<i>emptying his pockets.</i>

<i>The door opens. Cops are there.</i>

And they arrested me
for disorderly conduct,

profanity,

<i>as opposed to disorderly conduct
drunk, I guess...</i>

REPORTER:<i> ...that he did</i>
<i>on July 21st, 1972...</i>

(READS POLICE REPORT)

In 1972, I happened to go
to my very first Summerfest

in Milwaukee.
Huge crowds and performance.

And I was there
when George Carlin

performed his routine.

The next morning, got up
for my Saturday rotation of duty

and in walked the police
with George Carlin in handcuffs.

GEORGE:<i> The next day,</i>
<i>the district attorney</i>

<i>asked the policeman,
he was questioning me.</i>

He says, "Was there disorder?
Was he saying this to people?

Was he mad? Was he disorderly?
Were the people disorderly?"

He said, "I dunno," he said...

So he turned to his assistant
district attorney, and he said,

"You were there.
What did the audience do?"

He said, "Well, they gave him
a standing ovation."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

I do recall that at some point
during the trial,

the judge sort
of covered his face.

He did not want people to see
that he was laughing

at the routine
that was being performed.

There was no dispute
that he said the words.

The issue was,
did it tend to cause

or provoke a disturbance?
And, of course,

not only did it not, I was there
and saw that it did not.

<i>So, George Carlin
was not guilty.</i>

â™ª (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

GEORGE:<i> I thought I might</i>
<i>bring you up to date on the list</i>

<i>of words you can't say
all the time.</i>

-That's the only thing.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

That's the only thing
you can really call them

and includes them.

"The words you can't say
all the time."

Some of the time,
not all the time.

When you're a kid,
you can't say any of them.

(SCOFFS, GROANS) None at all.

Then pretty soon you're growing.
They can't stop that, can they?

But pretty soon, "hell"
and "damn" break through.

Dad tells you a joke
with "shit" in it. (EXHALES)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

"Don't tell your mom
I told you that."

"Why not?" "It's a word
you can't say all the time."

Not all the time. Mixed company,
there's ladies here.

"Hey, I got a joke for you,
Floyd, but this lady's here."

"Go ahead. She's filthy.
Tell me."

It's all it is.
It's your filth threshold.

The thing that bothers me
is that there's no list

of these words anywhere, man.
I mean, it would make sense

to have a list of them,
wouldn't it?

They never give you a list
when you're a kid.

You've got to say them
to find out what they are.

-Shit. (MIMICS THUD)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-Fuck. (MIMICS THUD)
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Wouldn't it be smart
to give you a list?

"You're six years old now.
Here's the list of the words

your daddy and I don't ever
want to hear you say."

"Hey, thanks, Ma.
Boy, that'll come in handy.

Save me an ass-kicking."

-(MIMICS THUD)
-(GROANS)

The whole idea of the original
seven words routine

was that he wanted to know

what are the words that I might
get fined for saying on stage.

And he said, "You know,

ironically,
the FCC won't tell me.

So how do I know

if I'm gonna be in trouble
or not?"

GEORGE: I kept finding more ways
to describe dirty words

than there were dirty words.

They call them dirty, bad,
filthy, foul, vile, vulgar,

-off-color...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

...blue...

naughty, bawdy, saucy, raunchy,

street language, gutter talk,
locker room talk,

barracks language, indecent...

-in poor taste, suggestive...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

...cursing, cussing, swearing,
profanity, obscenity.

All I could think of was shit,
piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker,

motherfucker, and tits.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

Seven words.

He says the seven dirty words,
shit, piss, fuck, cunt,

cocksucker,
motherfucker, and tits.

Shit, piss, cunt.

Shit, piss, fuck, cunt,
cocksucker, motherfucker, tits.

And the crowd goes crazy.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

Shit, piss, fuck, cunt,

cocksucker,
motherfucker, and tits.

That was my original list.
I knew it wasn't complete.

-PATTON:<i> Then he goes...</i>
-But it was a starter set.

PATTON:<i> ...and breaks apart</i>
<i>why are these dirty words?</i>

GEORGE:
<i>And usually, on television,</i>

<i>some of the words
aren't always dirty, like ass.</i>

<i>The word ass is okay.</i>

<i>Part of the time, you can say
ass on TV. You can say,</i>

<i>"Well, you've made a perfect ass
of yourself tonight."</i>

<i>But you can't say,
"Hey, let's go get some ass."</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

GEORGE:<i> You can use ass</i>
<i>in the religious sense.</i>

<i>If you happen to be the Redeemer</i>

<i>riding into town on one,
perfectly all right.</i>

<i>But don't get off and say,
"The donkey hurt my ass."</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

GEORGE:
<i>Same thing with the word ball.</i>

<i>It's okay for Joe Garagiola
at Saturday afternoon</i>

<i>to say, "Johnny Bench
has two balls on him."</i>

<i>But if he gets hit there,</i>

<i>they don't mention
he got hit in the balls.</i>

<i>They say it's a groin injury.</i>

<i>Words like prick,
prick is okay on television,</i>

<i>you can prick your finger.</i>

<i>-But don't finger your prick.</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

However,
you can refer to fucking.

You can talk about fucking.
They do that all the time.

Some of the times,
the show you're watching,

two people are probably fucking
in the other room.

Fucking is all right.
Fucking is part of the plot.

A lot of plots
are based on fucking.

Will they fuck?
Should they fuck?

Have they fucked? Did they fuck?
Will they fuck again?

Will they get sick from fucking?
Are they fucking too much?

Will they fuck
each other's friends?

Will they have a baby
from fucking?

Will they be sorry they fucked?
Will they be glad they fucked?

All fuck stories.

Every honeymoon joke
is a fuck joke.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

How did it get
such a bad reputation?

-We fucked it up.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Yeah.

I mean, shit, piss, fuck, cunt,
cocksucker,

motherfucker, and tits,
in a way,

he's talking about it's bullshit

that there are 400,000 words
in the English language,

and these seven "bad words."

Like the fact you can isolate.
They must be outrageous...

for them to be isolated
from a group that large.

And it made you think about,

"Oh, why do we accept
some things as acceptable

and not... and other things
not as acceptable?"

And the whole point was

"What's going to happen?
You heard the word.

Did you go out
and murder someone?

Did you go shoot up heroin?
No, you heard a word."

It's not about the word,
it's about the context.

Words, he always said,
Carlin always said,

"It's not the word.
It's the context

in which you use that word."

And when you eliminate context,
you eliminate nuance,

you eliminate intent,

there's no comedy,
there's no satire,

there's no free speech.

One-thirty on
an autumn afternoon
back in 1973,

a man named John Douglas,
the head of an electronics firm

and father of six children,

was driving
with his 15-year-old son

up in Connecticut.

The car radio was turned on
to a station in New York, WBAI.

Well, suddenly, they heard

comedian George Carlin's record
called<i> Filthy Words.</i>

It's an assault on my senses.
I don't seek it.

I don't desire it.

It might be his freedom
of expression,

but perhaps he should give up

that particular freedom
of expression

for the good of the community.

REPORTER:<i> Well, the FCC,</i>
<i>acting on Douglas's complaint,</i>

<i>imposed a ban on words like
the ones used</i>

<i>in the Carlin record.
Not necessarily obscene,</i>

<i>but words that, to many people,
might be offensive.</i>

It was played in the context
of language

and how we consider language.

<i>But it set off a chain reaction
of events</i>

<i>where the case
went through the courts</i>

<i>and the FCC was trying to use it
as a test case like,</i>

<i>"Where are we gonna draw
the line?"</i>

INTERVIEWER: How can you defend
the use of words

like this
on broadcasting stations?

Well, you don't have
to defend them, I don't think.

They are protected
by the First Amendment,

by free speech. Just as
in newspapers, in books...

(CLEARS THROAT) ...and in films,

the broadcast media
should be no different.

<i>My defense would be that there
are two knobs on these sets.</i>

<i>A person can choose
not to listen.</i>

<i>A person can change the station
if they like. The question is,</i>

<i>can the Federal Communications
Commission</i>

<i>abridge freedom of speech?</i>

<i>How did they get the power
to do that?</i>

<i>And that's what the case
is about.</i>

I think
Mr. Carlin's a very funny man,

probably the funniest comedian
around today.

In a nightclub situation,
it would be perfectly in order

because for one thing,
I probably couldn't bring

anybody in under 18.

Well, there was just the point
of the fact

that there's no prior restraint.
Even though that's true,

the fact that you can
be punished for something

is a form of subtle
unspoken prior restraint.

There is a de facto censorship
here

whereby stations
will be afraid to make

a decision
because of the possibility.

<i>Philosophically,
I do not buy the assumption</i>

<i>that these words
are somehow immoral</i>

<i>or indecent
in and of themselves.</i>

<i>Words are only symbols, and they
do not possess those qualities.</i>

<i>People can be immoral
or indecent.</i>

<i>The words themselves
cannot harm us.</i>

The United States Supreme Court
says that

the public airwaves,
television, radio,

and other forms of broadcasting

are not the place
for what it calls "dirty words."

GEORGE:<i> They had found</i>
<i>a new category of bad language.</i>

NEWS ANCHOR:
<i>...may restrict the broadcast</i>

<i>of indecent language. But...</i>

GEORGE:<i> Indecent.</i>
<i>And that was my contribution.</i>

<i>So I have this perverse pride
that I'm an important footnote</i>

<i>along the way somewhere</i>

<i>in the legal history
of our country.</i>

HASAN MINHAJ:
<i>Things like the seven words</i>

<i>or Lenny Bruce getting arrested,</i>

it's no different
than that journalist in Belarus,

them landing the plane, and then
ripping him off the plane.

a great satirist in Colombia

that was killed
in the early '90s.

<i>They are really

<i>who weren't there.
Fucking hallucinating,</i>

<i>which would come
from not just the drug alone,</i>

<i>but staying up six days.</i>

<i>I would stay up
as much as six days</i>

<i>and not eat.</i>

<i>There are times
when I think I shall go crazy,</i>

<i>and then there are times
when I feel quite all right.</i>

â™ª<i> So send in the clown â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't fuck around â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes
The pipes are calling â™ª</i>

(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

<i>I would miss dates,</i>

<i>and then they'd have
to reschedule them,</i>

<i>and I would go
to the cocaine doctor,</i>

<i>and he would make notes
that excused me</i>

<i>from the concert,
so we wouldn't get sued,</i>

<i>that I had laryngitis.</i>

<i>And I would have laryngitis
because I would sing</i>

<i>for six days
at the top of my voice</i>

<i>to the music I was playing.</i>

<i>â™ª It's so easy to love... â™ª</i>

<i>I would talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk</i>

<i>because the cocaine
made me talk.</i>

<i>And then I would try to do
a two-and-a-half-hour concert,</i>

<i>which is what I was doing then
and I would lose my voice.</i>

<i>Nobody gives a fuck
if you're stuck!</i>

<i>You're just stuck, you fuck.</i>

<i>Fuck you, you stuck fuck.</i>

â™ª (FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

Hold it, guys.
The band is going crazy.

Can't talk much anymore.

Worked out pretty good. We got
our week pretty well done.

George had a very,
very bad throat.

He couldn't talk
for about two weeks

-before he got here.
-Part of it's disuse

and part of it's putting
it into action again.

-It's a little rugged.
-MIKE DOUGLAS: Yeah.

It'll come back.

MIKE: Why don't you bring
your mom out?

GEORGE: Mary Carlin, my mom.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
-â™ª (MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

I hope you're excited
about being here.

-Yes.
-Because I'm very excited

-about having you here.
-Well...

MIKE: He's a good kid, isn't he?

And I've watched you for years,

-and I love you.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-MIKE: Oh. Thank you. Thank you.
-Love you.

Boy,
are we going to get along well?


-He's a good boy, isn't he?
-Yeah, he's a good boy. Now.

-MIKE: Now.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

MIKE: He wasn't always
a good boy?

No, no, no, no.

MIKE: What is your reaction
to George's present image?

Well, couple of years ago,

I hadn't seen him
with the beard,

nor the long hair.

No, not a word that I know.

And he suddenly appeared
in my home.

And there he stood.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-MARY CARLIN: I went silent.
-(MIKE CHUCKLING)

And when I'm silent,
there's trouble.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So he realized
something was happening.

And he said, "Mother,

don't you remember
what you wrote in my autograph

when I finished Corpus Christi?"

I said, "George...

insist on being yourself always
in all ways."

He said,
"Mother, eat your words."

(MIKE AND AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

KELLY:<i> My dad had invited</i>
<i>his mom to come out</i>

<i>for two weeks to stay with us,
and she never left.</i>

This was at the rock bottom
of my mother's alcoholism.

My mother was barely functioning
at this point.

And Mary was pouring drinks
for my mother at noon.

<i>Mary would have one,
and my mother would have two.</i>

<i>And then in my mother's ear,
telling every horrible thing</i>

<i>about my father,
what a bad son he is</i>

<i>and just, all of this darkness.</i>

<i>My mom is down to 87 pounds,</i>

<i>crawling to the bathroom,
and she was dying.</i>

I was ordering booze by the case
and having my drugs delivered,

and I was a vegetable.

How was George
during this period?
What did he try to do with you?

He was frantic.
He really wanted to help me.

I didn't know
what was wrong with me.

I honestly thought I was insane.

I thought I was going blind
in one eye.

I thought I had a brain tumor.

<i>Well, I knew I was going to die,</i>

<i>and I would stay awake
all night,</i>

<i>and I really hit a bottom.</i>

INTERVIEWER:
<i>What form was your bottom?</i>

Well, I guess,
my ultimate was backing

through a lobby of an inn

-in the Pacific Palisades.
-INTERVIEWER: That's a bottom.

-Yes, it really was.
-INTERVIEWER: Yes.

It was my last cry for help.

KELLY:
<i>My dad and I and a few doctors</i>

<i>finally convinced her
that she had to go</i>

<i>into the hospital.</i>

<i>There was no Betty Ford
back then.</i>

<i>There was no, really, rehab,
but it was a 21-day program.</i>

And about halfway through,

once my mother
had stopped shaking,

and she could sit in a chair,
and she'd gotten

kind of some her mind back
and everything,

she just said,
"I'm not coming home

if she's in the house."

And my dad
within like 30 seconds

was like, you know,
"Be right back."

-(CAR ENGINE REVVING)
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

GEORGE:<i> I had to kick</i>
<i>my mother out of my house.</i>

<i>Old woman. And I said,
"We're going to the airport."</i>

-â™ª (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª
<i>-I was never happier in my life.</i>

<i>I never had a greater feeling
of relief in my life</i>

<i>than to know that I'd never
have to take the car keys</i>

<i>out of her hand again,</i>

<i>that I would never
have to go through any of this</i>

<i>horrible fucking tension</i>

<i>and shit that went
with her drinking.</i>

<i>And, uh, life changed.</i>

INTERVIEWER: When you came
out of the facility,

you knew that
you had to change your life...

-Absolutely. All the way.
-...or you would die again.

That's right. And I made
that statement to George.

I either find who I am...
And, I mean, I felt

like I had really been given
a second chance.

â™ª (MUSIC CONTINUES) â™ª

KELLY:<i> After my mom got sober,</i>
<i>my mother flourished.</i>

<i>Not only was she
super involved in AA,</i>

<i>but she became a counselor
for people,</i>

<i>she volunteered at the VA.</i>

<i>And she immediately got involved
in my dad's production stuff.</i>

<i>So she became a producer.</i>

<i>She ended up working
for HBO for years.</i>

<i>She was a talent coordinator.
She became the Brenda Carlin</i>

<i>that she was always meant
to become.</i>

GEORGE:<i> I want to do one thing</i>

before I go any further
because I am going to split.

There's somebody

that's very important
to this project and to me.

Brenda,
would you please come here?

I want to introduce you
to my wife of 17 years.

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-She is the associate producer,

and she is my honey.

And if she don't come out
here now.

Come here, honey,
I want you to give me a kiss.

My wife, Brenda Carlin.
Come here, honey.

Thank you, lover. See you later.

<i>Thank you all.
And good night. I love you!</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

Live from New York,
it's<i> Saturday Night.</i>

â™ª (MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

ANNOUNCER:<i> NBC's</i> Saturday Night.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
George Carlin.</i>

Talk about a live show. Wow.

Nice to see you, welcome,
and thanks for joining us live.

I'm kind of glad
that we're on at night,

so that we're not competing
with all the football

-and baseball games.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So many, man. All the time.

And this is the time of year
when there's both, you know?

Football's kind of nice.
They changed it a little bit.

They moved the hash marks in.

Guys found them
and smoked them anyway.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JAMES SULLIVAN:<i> Famously,</i>
<i>he was the first guest host</i>

<i>on</i> Saturday Night Live.

But besides that feather
in his cap

of forever being able to say,

"I was the first guest host
for<i> Saturday Night Live..."</i>

GEORGE:<i> ...the words</i>
<i>surrounding football</i>

<i>and baseball...</i>

JAMES:<i> ...he was not getting</i>
<i>the same kind of attention</i>

<i>that he had been getting
in the early '70s.</i>

Football is technological.
Baseball is pastoral.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Football is played in a stadium.
Baseball is played in a park.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-In football, you wear a helmet.

-In baseball, you wear a cap.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

JAMES:<i> At that point, I think</i>
<i>there were people saying,</i>

<i>"Carlin's kind
of yesterday's news</i>

<i>in terms of comedy." Like</i>

he's not as big
as Cheech and Chong,

for instance, is right now.

Led Zeppelin. (MIMICS WHIRRING)

Hey, be careful with that shit,
man.

PAUL:<i> In comedy, the art form...</i>

-Here I come to save the day.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

...and the business of comedy
were changing radically.

-Oh, my God.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

PAUL:<i> You know, that's the time</i>
<i>where Steve Martin</i>

<i>-was coming through.</i>
-Okay, good. Now,

let's repeat
the non-conformist oath.

"I promise to be different."

AUDIENCE:
I promise to be different.

"I promise to be unique."

AUDIENCE:
I promise to be unique.

"I promise not to repeat things
other people say."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Steve Martin's work
was a response

to the counter-cultural comedy
of the '70s.

Steve said,
"That's now become the trope."

Excuse me, folks,
but you're not thinking

of going back
to the mainland, are you,

without seeing
this historical site?

JAMES:<i> Suddenly the gigs</i>
<i>were kind of drying up.</i>

<i>So he was getting offered
goofy stuff</i>

<i>like</i> Perry Como's Christmas
in Hawaii Special.

You guys with the peg legs,
stand up straight.

Guys with the eye patches,
look this way.

But he knew that to continue
to sell out

the venues that he was playing,

he had to be a known figure
from TV.

Oh, Mr. Wow, this is certainly
a great opportunity.

-Thank you.
-GEORGE:<i> You can't be</i>
<i>the hot new guy in town forever.</i>

I really mean it!

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-GEORGE:
<i>You can't be the fastest gun</i>

<i>because a faster gun is coming
to town in a few years.</i>

<i>My record career began to kind
of wane in the '70s...</i>

-(SHRIEKS)
<i>-...as did the counterculture.</i>

Are you finished?

<i>Disco came into play,</i>

<i>and the people
who are the true radicals,</i>

<i>they retreated to the hills,</i>

<i>and the other ones went
and got MBAs</i>

<i>-and stuff like that.</i>
-(INTERVIEWER CHUCKLING)

GEORGE:<i> And there I was,</i>

<i>sort of not knowing who I was
and who I should become</i>

<i>to be true to myself.</i>

Tragedy at the parade today.
An open manhole-- yes, yes--

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Funny where tragedy crops up.
At the parade today...

(CLEARS THROAT)
...an open manhole cover

claimed-- not the cover,
the manhole--

-(CHUCKLES)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

It's about shot now,
but I'll finish it anyway.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

TONY ORLANDO:
<i>George was a very warm,</i>

<i>almost shy personality,</i>

<i>contrary to what you saw
on stage.</i>

<i>There was a humble side
to George that I didn't expect,</i>

but I don't know how many people
hung out with George

because I never saw George

hanging with other performers
that much.

You know, I don't even know
who his friends were.

It's so weird.

<i>You didn't sense
that he was lonely,</i>

<i>but he liked being alone.</i>

<i>But he comes to my office at CBS
and asked me for a job.</i>

Now, I was blown away

because I would think
I would be the last guy

that George--
<i>Tony Orlando and Dawn</i> show?

That I would be the last--

So, I probably
was the last guy on his list.

-(CHUCKLES)
-â™ª (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

ALL:
<i>â™ª Climb the highest mountain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And we'll sail
The seven seas... â™ª</i>

TONY:<i> Now, remember,</i>
<i>this time period,</i>

<i>there was only three networks.
So, 40 million people</i>

<i>was with us
every Wednesday night.</i>

<i>That was a 36th share.</i>

Today, that probably
would be the Super Bowl.

Now it's time for George.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

How you doing? Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Thank you.

I bet you've had words
you'd like to change

or things you'd like to add
to the language.

Things that could be easier.

Arthritis should be
arth-wrong-us.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

I think we should have
cheese fon-don't

for people who don't like
cheese fondue.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-Migraine should be your-grain.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-Sure.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

-Hernia ought to be his-nia.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And hysterectomy
ought to be her-terectomy.

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

INTERVIEWER:
<i>Why did you take that job</i>

<i>on</i> Tony Orlando and Dawn?

GEORGE:
<i>Because it was a chance to work</i>

<i>within the system
outside of the system.</i>

<i>Once a week in your own spot,
which is great exposure, right?</i>

INTERVIEWER:<i> It's hard</i>
<i>for a lot of young people,</i>

<i>I think, to justify going on
Dinah Shore and Mike Douglas,</i>

<i>who are not the greatest
flaming radicals...</i>

-GEORGE:<i> Yes.</i>
<i>-...why do you do that?</i>

GEORGE:<i> I don't go on things</i>

<i>because of flaming radicals
to start with.</i>

<i>At the time
when I appeared more radical,</i>

<i>I used to make
the observation that,</i>

<i>"Wow, there are people out there
fighting in streets,"</i>

<i>getting whacked out
on picket lines and stuff.</i>

<i>If these few jokes I make
qualify me as a radical,</i>

<i>"then the movement
is in big trouble."</i>

INTERVIEWER:
<i>Well, you've mellowed them.</i>

<i>-Is that right?</i>
-GEORGE:<i> That's right. Sure.</i>

<i>I've passed
some of my rebelliousness</i>

<i>out of my system by now,</i>

<i>and it was never meant
to be my mode, I guess.</i>

INTERVIEWER:
<i>You don't have any formal...</i>

<i>-You don't go to church?</i>
-GEORGE:<i> No.</i>

<i>We didn't raise our daughter
in a church either.</i>

<i>In times of stress,</i>

<i>I still go back
and say the Hail Mary,</i>

<i>but I know that I'm using it
as more as a mantra</i>

<i>than as an appeal
to some person.</i>

<i>I think that sense
of superior being</i>

<i>that we look to
when we look to that, is us.</i>

<i>We're calling
on a higher potential</i>

<i>in ourselves when we say,</i>

<i>"Please help me, God."
We're saying,</i>

<i>"Please, God, help me find
in me what it is like you</i>

<i>that'll make me do this
the way I'd love it."</i>

<i>See what I mean? Good ideas.
No book learning.</i>

-(CHUCKLING)
-(INTERVIEWER CHUCKLING)

<i>It's nice to be able to sit down
and talk to a genius.</i>

GEORGE:<i> Oh, yeah? Well,</i>

<i>we're going to have
to redefine that term.</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

â™ª (GEORGE SCATTING GOOFILY) â™ª

<i>â™ª All I have to keep me
Is my memories of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I sit alone at night
And wonder what did do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I lost you, it's true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I still have my memories
Of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Memories of you â™ª</i>


CREW MEMBER:<i> Okay, George,</i>
<i>give me some head movement.</i>

<i>Then let's start again.</i>

PAUL:<i> He had been the guy</i>
<i>changing the form,</i>

<i>and suddenly, he wasn't anymore.</i>

What is a handicap?

A handicap is a hat
that's there when you need it.

What is a cap pistol?

A gun for shooting hats off.
Get it? (MIMICS GUNSHOT)

PAUL:<i> So, Carlin felt</i>
<i>out of step creatively.</i>

<i>He wasn't filling theaters
the way he had been.</i>

<i>That's why I think
a lot of the work he did</i>

<i>around that time,
it's kind of exploratory.</i>

<i>It's kind of... I don't know.</i>

It's hard to describe,

but it's certainly not
his best work.

GEORGE:<i> I want to tell you</i>
<i>how much I love peas.</i>

<i>I used to say, "I love this."
"Boy, I really love baseball.</i>

<i>Hey."</i> (CHUCKLING)

GEORGE:<i> You like baseball.</i>

<i>-I fucking love peas, man.</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

PATTON:<i> He was kind</i>
<i>of in the wilderness.</i>

GEORGE: (SINGING TO TUNE OF
"GIVE PEACE A CHANCE")
â™ª<i> All I am saying â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is give peas a chance â™ª</i>

He had kind of collapsed
in on himself a little bit,

where he was literally
parsing words

to a point
where it sounded like

someone doing a parody
of George Carlin.

Underrated vegetables
like beets. Beets.

SCTV did a pretty vicious
take on him.

-Beats me.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

There's red wine,
and there's white wine,

-but there's no green wine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

There's green grapes,
but no green wine.

-Why?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

For God's sakes,
will you just shut up?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Max, do you ever notice
when you're making a movie

that you always show eating
but never going to the bathroom?

Come on, come on, and stop doing
those stupid bits.

Women hate them. I hate them.

GEORGE:<i> At the end of the '70s,</i>

<i>somebody wrote a column
in some paper,</i>

<i>and it was a paper I admired,
saying...</i>

(READS PROMPT)

<i>And then in an article
somewhere, Cheech Marin,</i>

<i>he says...</i>

(READS PROMPT)

<i>He's obsolete.</i>

(READS PROMPT)

<i>-I see that.</i>
-INTERVIEWER:<i> Jesus.</i>

GEORGE:<i> So I say to myself,</i>

<i>"I'm gonna make
these people pay..."</i>

<i>by getting better</i>

<i>"and learning how to really
be a fucking artist."</i>

<i>And it gave me an inner resolve
to be terrific.</i>

â™ª (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

<i>To go to a new level.</i>
