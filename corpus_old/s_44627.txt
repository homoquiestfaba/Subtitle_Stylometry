'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...

in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

For the story that you
are about to be told...

took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!

Boys and girls
of every age

Wouldn't you like to see
something strange

Come with us
and you will see

This our town
of Halloween

This is Halloween
This is Halloween

Pumpkins scream
in the dead of night

This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene

Trick-or-treat till the
neighbor's gonna die of fright

It's our town
Everybody scream

In this town of Halloween

I am the one hiding
under your bed

Teeth ground sharp
and eyes glowing red

I am the one hiding
under your stairs

Fingers like snakes
and spiders in my hair

This is Halloween
This is Halloween

Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

In this town we call home

Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

In this town
Don't we love it now

Everybody's waiting
for the next surprise

'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can

Something's waiting now
to pounce and how you'll
Scream

This is Halloween
Red and black
And slimy green

Aren't you scared
Well, that's just fine

Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

Ride with the moon
in the dead of night

Everybody scream
Everybody scream

In our town of Halloween

I am the clown
with a tear-away face

Here in a flash
and gone without a trace

I am the who
when you call who's there

I am the wind blowing
through your hair

I am the shadow
on the moon at night

Filling your dreams
to the brim with fright

This is Halloween
This is Halloween

Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

Tender lumplings everywhere

Life's no fun
without a good scare

That's our job
But we're not mean

In our town of Halloween

In this town
Don't we love it now

Everyone's waiting
for the next surprise

Skeleton Jack
might catch you in the back

And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin

This is Halloween
Everybody scream

Won't you please make way
for a very special guy

Our man Jack is king
of the pumpkin patch

Everyone hail
to the Pumpkin King now

This is Halloween
This is Halloween

Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

In this town we call home

Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

La, la, la, la, la, la
Halloween, Halloween

La, la, la, la, la, la
Halloween, Halloween

La, la, la, la, la, la
Halloween, Halloween

La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee

It's over!
We did it!

Wasn't it terrifying?
What a night!

Great Halloween, everybody.

I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

No! Thanks to you, Jack.

Without your
brilliant leadership--

Not at all, Mayor.
You're such a scream, Jack.

You're a witch's fondest dream.
You made walls fall, Jack.

Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
Let go!

You're not ready
for so much excitement.
Yes, I am!

You're coming with me!
No, I'm not!

Come back here, you foolish--

Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.

Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!

Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.

Our first award
goes to the vampires...

for most blood drained
in a single evening.

Our second and
honorable mention...

goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.

Nice work, Bone Daddy.

Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...

and the year before that,
and the year before that.

There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best

For my talents
are renowned far and wide

When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort

Of my ghost-like charms

I have seen grown men
give out a shriek

With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan

I have swept the very bravest
off their feet

Yet year after year

It's the same routine

And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams

And l, Jack
the Pumpkin King

Have grown so tired
of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep

Inside of these bones

An emptiness

Began to grow

There's something out there

Far from my home

A longing that

I've never known

I'm the master of fright

And a demon of light

And I'll scare you
right out of your pants

To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky

And I'm known throughout
England and France

And since I am dead
I can take off my head

To recite Shakespearean quotations

No animal nor man
can scream like I can

With the fury
of my recitations

But who here

Would ever understand

That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin

Would tire of his crown
lf they only understood

He'd give it all up

If he only could

Oh, there's an empty

Place in my bones

That calls out for

Something unknown

The fame and praise

Come year after year

Does nothing for

These empty tears

Jack.

I know how you feel.

Sally!

You've come back.

I had to.
For this!

Yes.
Shall we, then?

That's twice this month
you've slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off.

Three times.
You're mine, you know!

I made you with my own hands.

You can make other creations.

I'm restless. I can't help it.

It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

We need to be patient, that's all.

But I don't want to be patient.

No, Zero, not now.

I'm not in the mood.

All right.

Here you go, boy.

Mornin', gents!

Jack, you home?

Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.

I can't make decisions by myself.

Jack, answer me!

Huh?
He's not home.

Where is he?
He hasn't been home all night.

Where are we?

It's someplace new!

What is this?

Whoa-oa-oa!

Whoa!

What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere

What's this
There's white things in the air

What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming

Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this

What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong

What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this

The streets are lined
with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy

Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this

What's this

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads

They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead

There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes

And in my bones
I feel the warmth

That's coming from inside

Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe

They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired

They're gathering around
to hear a story

Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this

What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer

And who would ever think
And why

They're covering it
with tiny little things

They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone

So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun

Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this

Oh my, what now
The children are asleep

But look
There's nothing underneath

No ghouls, no witches here
to scream and scare them or ensnare them

Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland

What's this

The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found

And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air

The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around

I've never felt so good before

This empty place
inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own

I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found

What is this

Christmas Town?

Hmm.

Ho-ho-ho-ho!

Ho-ho-ho-ho!

Hmm.

This has never happened before.
It's suspicious.

It's peculiar.
It's scary.

Stand aside. Coming through.

We've got to find Jack!

There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

Three sixty-four!

Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

I looked in every mausoleum.

We opened the sarcophagi!

I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.

I did! But he wasn't there.

It's time to sound the alarms!

Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.

Bitter!

Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?

Sally? ls that soup ready yet?

Ah. Coming!

Lunch!

Ah, what's that?

Worm's wart! Mmm!

And frog's breath?

Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought
you liked frog's breath.

Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

I'm not hungry. Oops.

You want me to starve...

an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

Oh, don't be silly.

Mmm! See? Scrumptious!

Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

Oh, this morning.

Hear that?
Ah, what?
Shh.

Zero!

Jack's back!
Jack's back! Jack's back!

Where have you been?
Call a town meeting and I'll
tell everyone all about it.

When?
Immediately!

Town meeting! Town meeting!

Town meeting tonight!

Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!

Listen, everyone!

I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed

All around things
to tantalize my brain

It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen

And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe

Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe
when I tell you this

It's as real as my skull
and it does exist

Here, let me show you.

Ooh!

This is a thing
called a present

The whole thing
starts with a box

A box
Is it steel
Are there locks

Is it filled with a pox
A pox, how delightful, a pox

If you please.

Just a box with
bright colored paper

And the whole thing's
topped with a bow

A bow
But why
How ugly
What's in it, what's in it

That's the point of the thing
Not to know

It's a bat
Will it bend
It's a rat
Will it break

Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake

Listen now
You don't understand

That's not the point
of Christmasland

Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock

And hang it like this
on the wall

Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot

Let me see, let me look
Is it rotted and covered with gook

Um, let me explain.

There's no foot inside
but there's candy

Or sometimes it's filled
with small toys
Small toys

Do they bite
Do they snap
Or explode in the sack

Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys

What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun

I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

Everyone, please
Now not so fast

There's something here
that you don't quite grasp

I don't know.
Do you get it?

Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last

For the ruler
of this Christmasland

Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice

Least, that's what
I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold

Like a lobster huge and red

When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on

Carting bulging sacks
with his big great arms

That is so I've heard it said

And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight

He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky

And they call him

Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited

But they don't understand

That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland

Oh, well.

Hmm.

Hmm.

There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.

Oh, my head!

The door is open!

Hello!
Jack Skellington!

Up here, my boy.
Doctor, I need to borrow some
equipment.

Is that so? Whatever for?

I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

How perfectly marvelous!

Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
I know.

Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

Hmm. Experiments?

Zero, I'm home!

Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?

You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

Sally?

Sally?

Oh, gone again!

Hmm.

Oh!

Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back

He's all alone up there
locked away inside

Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died

Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull

Will it let me be
I cannot tell

There's so many things
I cannot grasp

When I think I've got it
and then at last

Through my bony fingers
it does slip

Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting

Like a memory
long since past

Here in an instant
Gone in a flash

What does it mean
What does it mean

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked

These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door

Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see

What does it mean
What does it mean

What does it mean

Hmm. Hmm.

I've read these Christmas books
so many times

I know the stories
and I know the rhymes

I know the Christmas carols
all by heart

My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart

As often as I've read them
Something's wrong

It's so hard to put
my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think

Am I trying much too hard

Of course
I've been too close to see

The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air

Invisible but everywhere

Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems

And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree

And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do

Eureka!

This year,
Christmas will be ours!

Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.

Dr. Beetlestein.

Your Christmas assignment
is ready.

Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.

What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

Perhaps it can be improved?
No problem!

I knew it!

Doctor, thank you for coming.

We need some of these.

Hmm.

Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

How horrible
our Christmas will be.

No! How jolly!

Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

What are you doing here?
Jack sent for us.

Specifically.
By name.

Lock.
Shock.
Barrel.

Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.

Ah, Halloween's finest
trick or treaters.

The job I have for you
is top secret.

It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.

Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!

Now.

Tree.

Christmas Town.

Ow! Hmm.

And one more thing.

Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

Whatever you say, Jack.

Of course, Jack.
Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

I wanna do it
Let's draw straws
Jack said we should work together

Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
Now and forever

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight

Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights

First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait

When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man

Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box

Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks

And Mr. Oogie Boogie man

Can take the whole thing
over then

He'll be so pleased I do declare

That he will cook him rare
Whee

I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then

Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up
to smithereens

We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag

Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around

If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased
by our success

That he'll reward us too
I'll bet

Perhaps he'll make
his special brew

Of snake and spider stew

We're his little henchmen
and we take our job with pride

We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one

You're no fun
Shut up
Make me

I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see

We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read

Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity

Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick

Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits

Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see

Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key

Sandy Claws, huh?

It goes something like this.

How about it?
Think you can manage?

A-one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a--

Next!
Fantastic!

Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.

Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

That's splendid!
No! It was about your Christmas.

There was smoke and fire.
That's not my Christmas.

My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.

And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.

How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

This part's red.
The trim is white.

It's a mistake, Jack.
Now, don't be modest.

Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

Next!
I have...

Oh.
every confidence in you.

But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

This device
is called a nutcracker.

Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!

Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!

That's not Sandy Claws!

It isn't?
Who is it?
