On behalf of the sons of Italy,

we welcome you,
Mr. marciano. Champ.

Pound for pound,
the greatest...

Ah, hey, hey, enough. Enough.
Just call me rocky. Geez!

Rocky.

And since you've been
the inspiration

to every Italian-American
across this country

for longer than most
of us can remember...

Get on with it, gino.
Let's hear the rock.

I want to present to you this
sportsman of the century award.

.

<i>Basta. Come on. Sit down. .</i>

Ah, terrific.

Thank you.

I don't know what the heck
I'm gonna do up here.

I mean, I don't sing,
I don't dance.

But just to be gracious, I'll
take on any guy in the house.

.

Thank you all.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª when you're smilin'
when you're smilin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª the whole world
smiles with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and when you're laughin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª oh, when you're laughin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª the sun comes
shining through â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª but when you're cryin'
you bring on the rain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª so stop that sighing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª stop that sighing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª be happy again â™ª</i>

Rocky, I can't tell you
how much this meant to us,

you coming here.
Thank you.

You know, uh, when you knocked
out walcott back in '53,

my dad and every Italian in the
neighborhood, they celebrated for a week.

He'd love to meet you.

Well, I'd love to, but I've got a
previous engagement in Chicago.

.

Damn.

Hey, champ.
Where you goin'?

I'll be right back.
I forgot somethin'.

Boston burgers!

.

Pop, hey, pop.

What are you doin' here
so early?

Get out of sight.
You want to get me fired?

Huh, what happened to my lunch?

Hey, marchegiano.

What's your kid
doin' here again?

It ain't lunch yet.

.

Oh, God, my hand!
My hand!

Shut it down.
Shut it down.

Come on. Come on.
Get him to the hospital..

Get him out of here.

All right, that's it. Ain't nothing more to see.
Back to your business.

I hate this place, papa.

You're never gonna
work here, rocco.

I'm tellin' you. Never.

Everything ok in there, rock?

Yeah, everything's fine now.
I'll be right out.

<i>...Nazi poster boy
who k.O.'D Joe Louis 2 years ago. .</i>

<i>So, tonight, Louis fights
not just for vengeance, .</i>

<i>But for freedom and democracy
the world over. .</i>

What're you putting
that up for?

I like to see
what I'm hearing on the radio.

You're putting up a picture
of <i>moolie in your own home? .</i>

Hey, Joe Louis is
the champion of the world.

What have you ever done
in your life?

I did not go overseas
to fight the Germans

to come home here
and... and live off charity.

It's not charity.
It's coupons for food.

It's from the church...

.

Enough.

It's starting, papa.

Uh, you go ahead, rocco.

I'm... I'm coming right down.

The big fight is going on.

We finish this
a little later. Hm?

Why you let him
listen to that, huh?

The boy likes boxing.
What is the harm?

<i>The cruelest sport. .</i>

<i>Oh, and an explosive
right to the jaw, hurting schmeling. .</i>

<i>Louis is all over the big
German here in round 1. .</i>

<i>A barrage of punches
to the head .</i>

<i>As schmeling starts
to crumble against the ropes. .</i>

<i>A dynamite right,
and schmeling goes down.</i>

<i>.</i>

<i>But he's up on the count of 2.
He staggers up, .</i>

<i>And a crushing right slams
schmeling down for the 3rd time. .</i>

<i>It doesn't look like
Max is gonna make it. .</i>

<i>He can't get up.
It's over. It's all over. .</i>

Yes!

Yes!

Louis beat schmeling.

.

Louis beat the Nazi.

Louis is the champion
of the world.

.

What? Oh.

He's the champion of the world.

Louis beat schmeling.
All right.

Louis! Louis! Yeah!

Knock it off, you little
hooligans, or I'll call the cops.

There you go,
Mrs. drago.

Ah, thank you.

Enjoy the day. You, too..

Next.

Come along.

Paying with these today,
Mr. Murphy, ok?

Marchegiano,
can't you read English?

Cash customers first.

Back of the line.

Hey, papa.
What about the food?

Where are you go... papa.

Come on, Allie.
Let's get to the back...

Next.

Crooked. Again.

.

Sit with me for a moment.

.

You know, rocco,

I come to America on the
same boat as your grandpa.

Oh, the promises we had
ringing in our ears.

We couldn't hear nothing else.

Instead,

we become dagos, wops.

They say we're lazy.

Or worse,

the black hand. The mafia.

The only thing that matters is
what you got inside you, rocco.

Your pride.

When I was a little boy,

I was too small to go
fishing with my father.

So I hang around the docks, I do all
sorts of little jobs for the fishermen.

They give me oyster shells.

Oysters?
Yeah.

Yeah. In italia, a rich man's
court, a real <i>bocce court, .</i>

Is made of the crushed shell
of the oyster.

That's what makes the ball run
straight like it's supposed to.

One day,

I bring home
all the shells I save up.

I give them to my father

to make a <i>bocce court
for his own. .</i>

That's how I learn.

Not just the <i>bocce. .</i>

How to save.

The little boy spends, uh?

A man saves.

A man is nothing

without cash.

<i>I, uh, hope you
like the plaque, rocky. .</i>

<i>Oh, yes, it's terrific.</i>

2 boxers facing each other...

I understand the logic, ok?

Oh, uh, there's a car waiting to
take you right to the airport.

That's swell.

I'm sure you'll
find this satisfactory.

Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

$2,000.

Oh, see, here's the thing...

Hey, rocky.
How're you doin'?

I don't take checks.
You got any cash?

Not $2,000.

How much you got?

Uh, I don't know.
About $400, $500.

You've put me in an
embarrassing situation here.

This is fine. This'll do.
Thank you.

But... but... but rocky, uh...

See, this is a piece of paper.

This... this is money.

<i>â™ª When you're smiling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª when you're smiling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª keep on smiling â™ª
â™ª keep on smiling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and the whole world
smiles with you â™ª</i>

.

Give me my money.

Hey, what the hell's goin' on?

What's goin' on?

Dirty Mick says $5 for
shoveling coal, 7:00 to 4:00,

yeah.

Then he shit-cans us
at 3:45.

.

You Guinea fuck.

.

Oh!

Knock his lights out.

.

Oh, yes.

How do you like that, mcnutt?

.

Come on, rock. At least a little
extra for the aggravation. Come on.

I ain't no thief, Allie.

Yeah?

And you ain't shovelin' coal
no more, neither.

I can't believe you just cost
me another fuckin' job.

What do you wanna do,
make shoes? You bum, you.

Yeah, a bum with an arm.

This cocksucker
he just flattened

once took Jimmy braddock
15 rounds, huh.

Who, this guy?
Yeah.

Hey, wait.
Slow down a second..

Oh my God, <i>paisan,
take it easy. We're here. .</i>

Hiberians hall?
What the hell we doin' here?

Hey, pal, is this where you sign
up for the boxing tournament?

Yeah, sure.
Fill this out.

Whia, whoa,
slow down. Slow down.

Slow down my ass. You seen what
I did to that bum mcnutt..

You see this, Allie?

This here right hand's what's
gonna get me out of brockton.

Only heavyweight slot left
is against Henry Lester.

Yeah, sure. Sign me up.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Henry Lester's
the golden gloves champion.

He's the toughest amateur
in Massachusetts.

You ain't never boxed
for real in your life.

Allie, I wanna fight the guy
everyone's been duckin'.

That way, everybody knows
who's best, right off the bat.

Besides, he's an amateur.
How good could he be?

.

Jesus h. Christ.

Rocco, rocco,
look at the size of this guy.

One shot.

Introducing in this corner,.

In his first amateur bout,

weighing in at 210 pounds,

fighting out of brockton,
Massachusetts,

rocco "rocky" marchegiano.

.

Kick his ass, rock.

And in this corner,
weighing in at 230 pounds,

the golden gloves heavyweight
champion for 3 years in row

and runner-up in the new england.
-

Henry Lester.

All right, boys.
You know the rules.

I want to see a clean one here.

Touch gloves
and go to your corners.

.

Rocky's gonna kick his ass.

.

Go, rocco. Come on.

Don't try to punch..

Keep your hands up.

Come on, rock.
Keep your hands up.

Hit him, rocky.
Hit him, rocky.

Come on. Come on.

.

Come on.

Head up.

.

Get off the rope.

Get out of the corner.

$22.59. Rock,
we gotta get a real job.

I've been thinking, Allie.
It's time for me to turn pro.

Pro? Look at yourself.
What are you, nuts?

Oh, you sure don't belong in
a ring with those guys.

Those guys hit like girls.

I just don't train enough.
I'm out of condition.

It says here Joe Louis,
he boxes 30 rounds...

You're comparing
yourself to Joe?

I'm not comparing. If Joe Louis
boxes 30 rounds before a fight,

a guy like me has gotta
fight, what, like 60.

And if he runs 6 Miles,
I better cover 12.

If I train twice as hard as these guys,
maybe I got a shot at winning a fight.

Hey, we're broke. We need a shot
at getting some real jobs. Ok?

Allie, now you
wanna stick around here,

break your back,
then you be my guest.

I've seen what this place
did to my father,

and I'm not gonna
let it happen to me.

Now, I got a shot at gettin'
out of here, all right?

And with my next fight...

What next fight?

I'm fightin' again in 3 weeks.

You're fighting again?

Yeah, as a pro.

There's this big shot manager, Al
weill, coming up to Rhode Island.

He's looking for new talent. Now,
this guy's got 3 champions.

He's lookin' for a heavyweight.

Oh, then you're in.
Look.

I wrote him a letter.
I told him I was undefeated.

Undefeated?
You lost 4 times.

As an amateur.

But professionally,
I'm undefeated, technically.

Rocco, you don't know
how to box.

So I'll learn.

What are you gonna learn?

They beat my head in, I ain't went down once.
What do I got to lose, Allie?

Allie, Allie, listen to me.

There is no way
that I'm makin' shoes.

Now this is our best shot
at gettin' out of here.

Now, if we try our hardest and it
doesn't work, then we go get jobs.

What do you say?

Come on, Allie,
come on, what do you say?

What's the matter with you?

.

More.

All right.

Try to count. Count
them when you do it..

One.

You can only do one?
Come on.

One.

What's the matter with you?

What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on.

No. I can't. What do
you mean you can't?

I can't have bread.

You can't have bread?

I'm in training.
I gotta lose this.

Uncle Matthew's bread...

I never heard of such a thing.
Please.

He can't have bread.

It's very complicated.

Run in the spot. Get your knees up.
Get your knees up.

Get your knees up.
Get your knees up.

Good. Hey, see? When you
listen to me, you do good.

Look, you're off balance.
What are you doing?

Just hold the thing up.
I want to practice the right.

Keep your hands up. What did I tell you?
Keep your hands up.

There we go.
There we go.

My socks.
Hey, my socks.

There you go. Good.

Good. That looks like...
Hey!

Here you go, have a tomato.

Ma, I can't have tomato.

What do you mean,
you can't have a tomato?

Tomato.

I can't have a tomato.

How can a tomato hurt you?

I gotta eat steak.
It's all right, darling.

Have you ever
heard of such thing?

Can a tomato hurt him?
Now, you tell me.

I told you, it's complex.

Duck.

Ok.

Jab, jab, right.

Good. Jab, jab, right.

Good.

I can't swallow the steak. I
could just swallow the juice.

You can't swallow the steak?

I gotta lose weight, ma.

We finally get steak in the
house, he can't eat it.

.

Pa, what do you want from me?

Well, I don't care.

What is this...
Oh, my God.

<i>Flight 142 from
Houston is now arrmng at gate 2. .</i>

Barbara.

<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

LA guardia.

Rocky, what are you
still doin' in New York?

You're supposed to be home last night.
What's goin' on?

<i>Uh, shit. Yeah, I know,
I should have called, .</i>

But they gave me an award, the <i>paisans
all wanted to talk to me...</i>

<i>What else is new, rocco? .</i>

Do you realize that
you have only been home

one night in the last 6 weeks?

I mean,
when are you gonna stop?

<i>Now. I'm done. .</i>

This is it. Good
to see you, rock..

One more thing. I got this t.V.
Appearance in Chicago.

$4,000 for 5 minutes, and, uh,
uh, that's it, I'm done.

But we need you here. We got a
house full of people coming.

Barbara, I ever in a million
years miss her birthday?

Never.

Come on home, rocco.

I baked you a cake.
Mary Anne helped.

Mary Anne?
Is she there? Put her on.

I'll pick you up
at the airport at 4:00.

Ok, here's your daughter.

Oh, is that daddy?
Hm.

Kids, kids,
w-what's goin' on here?

Where are you, daddy?

Hey, truffle.
I'm coming home.

<i>You help mommy with the cake?</i>

I did the icing writing myself.

We're gonna have a great party.
Will you dance with me?

Will I dance with you?

When have you ever wanted
to dance with me?

â™ª

.

Hey, rock,
aren't you gonna dance?

I'm good, Allie.
Don't worry about me.

All right. Suit yourself.

Sorry.

Marchegiano, watch where
you're diggin' that heel.

I know you?

Barbara.

Barbara cousins?

You were 3 years ahead
of me at St. vib's.

Imagine me a foot shorter,
no chest.

Oh, yeah.

You grew.

.

You're one of those
smooth talkers, huh?

So you wanna dance?

You always this forward?

When I want somethin', yeah.

What is it that you want?

Right now, to dance.
Dance?

You know,
music, movement, dance.

Yeah, I heard of it.

Uh-huh.

Just I ain't big on footwork.

Come on.

Promise I'll let you lead.

As long as you know
what you're in for.

Will you look at that?
The rock is dancin'.

So, um, what's with
the exercise kick?

Exercise kick?
What are you talkin' about?

Who are you kiddin'?

You look like you sent away to the
comics for that Charles atlas thing.

Well, you don't seem to mind.

You wanna get out of here?

Where do you wanna go?

I don't mean now.
Not yet, anyway.

I mean brockton. You trying
to get out of brockton?

Tell you one thing.
I ain't makin' shoes.

No? What then?

A boxer.

That's a pretty tough racket.
You any good?

Undefeated as a professional.

Yeah?

Yeah. I'm fightin' at the
palisades tomorrow night.

You wanna come down?

That's kind of far.
Maybe next time.

Ok, I'll tell you what.

I'll leave you a ticket at the door
in case you change your mind.

You know what?

What?

We're dancing.

What was that? You looked like you
were dancing with your mother.

But I won.

Another one of life's
little mysteries.

Hit the asphalt, kid.

You're breathing too much air in here.
How is he, doc?

He's a bleeder.
He'll live?

Oh, he'll be ok.
That's the important thing.

Yeah.

Sure you're ready
for this, rock?

Yeah. Here comes weill. Make like
you know what you're doing.

Nice shoes you got there,
Mr. weill.

Would you listen
to this fucking kid?

He's about to get his head
turned into mashed potatoes

he wants to fuck my florsheims.

Uh, my... my father
makes shoes.

I'm just sayin'
they're nice shoes you got.

Great idea. Something to fall back on.
I understand.

Is he always this cheerful?

This is one of his good days.

.

<i>Introducing, in this corner,
in the red trunks, .</i>

<i>Weighing in at 225 pounds, .</i>

<i>Lee emerson.</i>

.

<i>And introducing,
in this corner, .</i>

<i>Weighing in at 190 pounds .</i>

<i>And fighting for the first
time as a professional, .</i>

Undefeated, eh?

<i>...rocky marchegiano.</i>

.

Go get him, rocco.
Come on.

Keep your feet moving..

Come on, rocky.

.

Watch his left.

Get off the rope..

Get him. Get him.

Come on, boys.
Break it up.

Cover up. Cover up.

Kill the bastard, rocky.
Kill him.

Pull the right.
The right.

Come on. You can do it.

That's right..

Take it from here, rocky.
That's right.

.

Yes!

Yes!

Corner. Go on.

Did you see that?

I, 2, 3...

I saw it. I saw it.

...4, 5, 6, 7,

8, 9, 10.

.

So?

.

He's too small, too light,
and awkward as all hell.

But he's got a right hand
like a fallin' safe.

I'd sign him immediately.

Oh, yeah.

This circus freak's gonna
make me some money.

I just mean that the way
marche...

Whatever the hell. That-that-that's gone.
It's too many letters.

So... so, I have to
change my name?

Just say it the way you spell it, you know.
Marciano, huh.

But I... my family...

Look, kid, you wanna argue
with me, or you wanna sign?

Ok, now, uh, uh,
what... what about Allie?

Charley Goldman's the best trainer
you'll ever meet. Really.

But me and Allie are partners.

I'm already paying a trainer.

You want him, it comes out of your end.
All right?

Right.

All right?

Ok, just promise me you won't
tell him I'm paying his way.

Tell him Roosevelt's
paying it, for all I care.

We got a deal?

Yeah. Uh, now this, uh, this
power of attorney. What...

Well, it just means
you give me the go-ahead

to take care of
everything for you.

Investments, tax shelters,
pensions, whatever.

Mmm-hmm. Ok.

Um, now,

this, uh, 50 percent
of... of... of everything?

Yeah, that's the deal. 50 percent.
50 percent of everything.

You know,
fight purses, endorsements.

You make $2 sellin' lemonade,
you owe me $1.

.

Um, but that's half, half
of everything I'm earning.

Doesn't that seem
a little steep to you?

Oh, yeah? How much money
you got in your pocket?

Uh, uh, I... i guess, well,
about $1.25.

Lucky man.

You wanna see
what 50 percent looks like?

So you wanna get
out of brockton, kid? Sign.

Mmm-hmm.

Put her there.

That's great to hear, pal.

You're a pilot?

Yeah.

Day and night.

H-how you feelin'?

Strong. Pretty strong.

You knock out 12 men, and you
feel only pretty strong?

You should feel like ironman.

You make
all the Italians proud.

As long as
I make you proud, pop.

How's work?

Yeah, work is work.

Like it's been
for the last 20 years.

Maybe someday they... they pay me
to stay home and play <i>bocce. .</i>

Till then,
I got to go to the factory.

Oh, no,
you don't have to do this.

I want to, papa.
I want to.

.

Hey, everybody,
look who we got here.

Hey, rocco.

The next heavyweight champion
of the fucking world.

How's it hanging, rock?

To the left.
Always to the left.

How you doin'?

Oh. God! I didn't know the marciano
fan club would be here tonight.

Last year, half of these guys
wouldn't give him the time of day.

Figures.

What do you say? You wanna put
some of your winnings to work?

I got this great idea
for expanding...

Now's not the time.

Who's that guy?

That's brockton Eddie.

Looking to borrow something?

Allie, good to see you.
Yeah. How you doing?

Come on, cut me $5,000 today, I'll
get you back $7,500 in 10 weeks.

I don't got that kind of money.

Terrific.
Thanks for saying that.

.

Who's that little tramp?

Oh, no, that-that... that's Eddie's sister.
She's nuts.

He feels sorry for her,
that's nothing.

.

Oh, hey, hey, hey,
look what's on... oh, rock.

Rock. Rock. Rock.
What?

Look who's on t.V.

Hey, hold it down, everybody.

It's the champ. Turn it up.

<i>...quite a long time. .</i>

<i>Well, it's time
for me to retire. .</i>

<i>I've had a long run
as champion. .</i>

<i>I've met a lot of wonderful
people on the way. .</i>

<i>But there's a lot more pleasant
things to do than beat up people. .</i>

<i>Thank you. .</i>

<i>Joe Louis, the greatest boxer
the world has ever known, .</i>

<i>At his retirement press
conference this afternoon. .</i>

<i>That's the news
for march 22, 1949. .</i>

Hey, hey, lookin' good,
lookin' very good.

Now knock it off the chain.

Rocky. Rocky.

Come here.

I'd like you to meet
Frankie carbo.

Nice to meet you,
Mr. carbo.

Nice to meet you, too, rocky.

I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

So, Mr. carbo, I, uh,
I hear you're the guy

that can make things happen
for me here in New York.

Whoa, rock, settle down.

That's all right.
That's all right.

I like a fighter
who's aggressive.

You think you're ready
to move up in the world?

Well, I'm ready
for the garden, Mr. carbo.

You can make book on that.

Well, with Louis retiring, there's
a little room to maneuver.

You know, there's another
Italian fighter,

carmine vingo.
You know him?

Yeah, heard of him.
Big kid, right? 6'4".

Yeah. A lot of people that
I know would like to see

2 undefeated Italian boys
go at it.

Could be a good draw.

I'm telling you, this kid...
This kid's the real thing.

He's ready.

Are you, rocco?

Are you the real thing?

.

Hello.

Mmm-hmm.

Yeah.

Ok.

I gotta go to New York.
We got the garden.

Oh.

.

Look at him.
I've never seen a kid

sleep like that before a fight.

The rock's about as nervous
as a fire hydrant.

Hey, it's time.

All right.

Hey, rocco.

Rocco, come on.

I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

Let's go.

Hey, listen to me,
sleeping beauty.

This is the garden. Madison square, N.Y.C.
You know what that means?

To lay it all on the line, huh.
Make it happen.

<i>And Madison
square garden is proud .</i>

<i>To have in its audience
tonight .</i>

<i>Returning to the site
of his dozens of triumphs, .</i>

<i>The legendary brown bomber,
the once and forever...</i>

Louis is here?
Joe Louis is here tonight?

To see me...

<i>...Mr. Joe Louis.</i>

.

Oh, it's bad enough my boss
wouldn't let me go to New York,

but he wouldn't
even let me off early.

I saved a place for you.

Oh, thanks.

.

Let him go.

.

Get under him.
Get under him.

He's cut.

Break it, boys, break it.
Break it up.

If you're gonna
stick in that crouch,.

You better use the uppercut.

This... this eye's a mess.

You gotta make it happen now.

He's bigger
and quicker than you.

You gotta kiss him
with that right hand.

Get out there and
knock this bum out,

and then we'll go home.
Yeah.

1, 2, 3,

4, 5,

6, 7, 8...

Go get him, rock.

Take it home.
Take him away.

You all right?

Take it home, rocky.
Take it home.

...3, 4, 5,

6, 7, 8, 9... he's out.

.

Get the doctor in here.

Good job, rock.

Kid, you all right?

.

Is he all right?
Is he all right?

Doc, is he all right?

No.

Somebody call an ambulance.

He'll be fine.

Doc, wake him up..

Don't worry about it, rocky.

.

The storm's held up
the ambulance.

But the hospital's
only 2 blocks away.

.

Over here. Over here.
Come on.

There's a gurney.
Get him on.

1, 2, 3..

Easy. Easy.

Let's go. Let's go.

.

Hey, come on, come on.

.

How is he?

Uh, intensive care.
A 50-50 shot.

Not vingo. Rocky.
Is he all right?

He's right as he's gonna be when
something like this happens.

You better talk to him, make sure
his head is screwed on straight.

I'm not gonna piss away my
time on another Lou ambers.

Yeah, Lou ambers,
lightnin' Lou.

Never got over
killing scarpatti.

But there is one piece
of good news here.

What's that?

Well, the way I figure it,

every day vingo's in a coma,

rocky's price goes up $10,000.

And if vingo
should happen to die,

the sky's the limit.

You know, it's a good thing
we're in a hospital

because this coffee
could kill you.

He had it all ahead of him.

His whole life, and I throw
one hand at his head...

It happens, rock.

You wanna play this game,
you gotta accept that.

And that easily could
have happened to you.

Well, maybe I'm not cut out
for it, then.

I mean, even when I win,
I don't win.

Excuse me.
You rocky marciano?

Yeah. Why,
what happened?

Nothing.

I was just, uh, wondering
if I could get your autograph.

There's a guy's dying
down the hall,

and you want a souvenir,
like I'm babe fuckin' Ruth?

Get the hell out of here.

.

How's vingo doing,
Mr. carbo?

Everything that can be done
is being done for him.

I've seen to it personally.

Wha-what does that mean?
What... what do you mean?

The deathwatch is still on?

Or has... has he still
got a chance? What?

It's too close to call right
now is what it means, kiddo.

Look, you're not doing him
or you any good

just sitting here,
watching the kettle.

Go back to brockton.
Get some rest.

You should be
with your family now.

No. I gotta stay here
till I know.

Listen to Mr. carbo, rock.

You ain't doing
nothin' just sittin' here.

Look, rocco,
a terrible thing happened.

I know your heart is heavy,
but it was an accident.

You gotta remember that,
an accident.

Yeah. Thanks, Mr. carbo.

And no matter what,

just remember,
you're not a murderer.

You gotta let it go or it'll ruin you.
You get me?

Yeah.

So go home, huh?

.

Hang on a second, Al.

<i>Scusi, signora vingo? .</i>

<i>I'm sorry...</i>

I hate that sign.

Thank you.

.

You heard.

You don't call me, but I heard.

This vingo boy.
He's Italian?

Mmm-hmm.

<i>Ã‰with a family? .</i>

Yeah, a wife.

<i>Holy heaven. .</i>

Every time you fight,
I go to church,

and I pray you don't get hurt

and you don't hurt nobody else.

And now look what happens.

Ma, don't get started, please.

I did not raise a murderer..

Enough, ma.

Well, that could've
gone better.

Maybe I ought to find
another racket.

Doin' what, makin' shoes?

I'll talk to Mr. carbo.
He likes me.

He'll set me up with something.

Yeah, he likes you
when you're boxing,

same as everyone else
that hangs on to you.

Like you?

Yeah, like me.

I'm sorry.

Come on, rocco..

Ever since we met,
all you've been telling me

is how you wanna
get out of brockton.

You have been given a gift.

Now you're gonna throw it away?

I'm not a boxer.

I'm a guy with a good punch
who got lucky.

You're 25 and 0 against the
best boxers in the world.

Would Louis act this way?

Louis never had to...

He punched natie brown straight
into the hospital in '36.

Brown never fights again.

4 months later, Louis k.O.'S
braddock for the title.

If Louis had given up, he'd be
sweeping floors right now.

Marry me.

No.

Look, vingo knew what he
was risking when he...

Barbara, did you hear what I said?
I asked if you would marry me.

How can I say yes with all that's
going on in your head now?

You're killing me here, I swear to God.
You don't love me?

Of course I love you.
How can you ask me that?

Even if I stop boxing?

Even if you make shoes.

<i>Good evening. .</i>

Hey, pop.

Hey, what are you doing here?

If it is to bring me my lunch,

I... i say you better
fix your watch.

Hey, listen, pop, I'm a little
tired from running around.

You mind if we sit down
for a second?

Uh, the vingo boy,
how... how's he doing?

Well, he's out of the hospital.

Looks like he's gonna be okay.

<i>Va bene. And you?
What are you gonna do? .</i>

You gonna go on fightin'?
Because I want you to know,

if you don't want to
it's ok by me.

Well, one good thing
that came out of this mess

is my price is going
through the roof.

It looks like after my next fight,
I might get my title shot...

Which means I'll be able
to pay off the house

and pull you out of this
damn factory for good.

Rocco, you don't
have to do that.

I mean, me, your mama, the
family, we're ok, really.

I want to, pop.

More than anything.

.

Hit him already.
Hit him.

What the hell's he doing?

I don't know.

Somebody ought to check
his cup for balls.

Go to the right..

What's wrong with him?

Vingo. He's not over
vingo yet.

Where's that right?

What is this, huh?

.

Wake up!

You're prancing around like
you're taking in the shorts.

What's wrong with you?

I feel a little tight today.

You're playing games.
Where's that right hand?

How am I doing on points?
Points?

Your whole career you were
never ahead on points.

Knock him out!

Hey, what kind of crap is this?

You're making me look
like a schmuck out there.

I'm the guy getting
his mug beaten about.

One of you step in and earn
the money for a change.

We're just trying to help
you here, all right?

You're 2 rounds away
from making penny loafers.

.

Maybe he'll get mad now.

Hit him. Come on.
Come on.

2, 3,

4, 5,

6,

you all right?

What the hell are you doing?

Come on, rocco.
Pull it together.

Come on, rocco.
Now's the time.

Come on, do it.

Throw the right.

We got trouble.

What're you doin', rocky?

Hey, hey, hey, whoa.
Watch your hands.

What? You couldn't
do that to lastarza?

Look, I don't care
what you think.

All he did was run, ok?

You forced the action.
You deserved the decision.

Bullshit.

A win is a win, rocco.

I stunk up the place,
didn't I, Charlie?

I seen you do better.

What the matter with you?

Where's that punch
they all paid to see?

Al, I don't know what to tell you.
I'm sorry.

I don't know
what happened out there.

You're lucky
the judges like you.

What does that mean?

You rigged the cards?

No, rocco, there was no fix.

But you candy-ass around the ring like
that again, there may have to be.

Now, you straighten up
and fly right.

Otherwise I'll drop you
like a bad habit.

Was.

Was?

Hey, Al!
Good to see you!

Good to see you too, yeah.

What do you mean, was?

I don't know how many
notches he dropped tonight.

He's ready
for the title shot right now.

Your boy's got a little wait
in front of him now.

Rocco, you can't
knock out everybody.

But I had him, pop.
I had him.

How you doin'?
Hey, good to see you..

How are you, man?
Thank you very much.

Good to see you.

.

Drinks for the house!

Pop. Pop, you see who that is?

Hey, rock. He's gonna come over.
Check it out.

Shh, Allie, shut up!
Just talk.

Act like you've been there
before, know what I mean?

Pop, look at the shoes
on this guy.

Hey, Charlie.
Hey, champ.

How you doing, huh?

I'm doing great.
How you doing?

Good. Good.

So I finally get to meet
the great white hope.

Mr. Louis.
What a pleasure.

I've been waiting
my whole life to meet you.

Really?
You need to get out more.

.

Now, I've known Charlie for years, but
who are the rest of these folks?

This here's my father, pierino.

Nice to know you, sir.

A pleasure. Thank you..

This is my corner man,
Allie colombo.

How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

And this is my, um...

I guess you'd call her...

Fiancee, Barbara.
My...

Oh, really? Is that so?

Yeah.

.

Seems I'm gettin' married,
Mr. Louis.

You take care of this man.

Oh, I will. I will.

From what I'm hearin',
he's the next dempsey.

He's better than dempsey.

He's better than you.

I'm sorry, Joe, but sometimes
my friend Allie here

likes to make jokes when maybe
he should shut his mouth.

It's ok.

Well, it was nice meetin' you folks.
Congratulations.

Thank you, Joe.
Thank you.

Charlie.

What are you, stupid?
That's the brown bomber!

Hey, hey, what's the matter
with you?

Dear God,
what are you doing to me?

Shh, did you see his face?

I saw his face.

Look at him.
Hey, hey.

In his eyes, he knew the truth, rock.
He knew.

Just sit down.
You had too much to drink.

Just sit down. I can't believe
you'd do this again to me.

Don't do this to me.

<i>I tell you, though.
I can't sing, I can't dance. .</i>

<i>But just to show
that I'm gracious, .</i>

<i>I'll take on any guy
in the house.</i>

<i>.</i>

<i>They're great.
Thanks a lot. Thank you. .</i>

He's killing them.

I can't get enough of this guy.

Call the boys in Vegas.

Tell them we got the guy
for their opening.

Oh, you were great, champ.

Thanks a lot, thanks.
Is my car ready?

Actually, I made us some
reservations at the pump room.

I got a business
proposition for you.

Hey, that's real swell of you,
but I got to get home.

I got my whole family waitin' on me.
You got my, uh...

Terrific.

$4,000. In cash,
like you requested.

Uh, no offense. It's not that
I don't trust you, but...

No, no, it's all there. Listen,
I know you're in a rush,

but, uh, I got
a few friends in Vegas.

They're in a little bit
of a bind.

I'm sorry to hear that.

They need somebody for their
casino opening tonight.

There'd be a fee, of course.

To tell you, pal, I'd love to,
but I swore to my wife...

$25,000.

Cash?

Allie? Why don't you
take care of this one.

Again?

Allie, take care of this.

Say, Allie, look at that little
guy at the end of the counter.

Who, the busboy?

That ain't no busboy.
That's lightnin' Lou ambers.

The ex-lightweight
champion?

Yeah.
Come on.

Hey, you boys done?

Yeah, say, Mac, your name
lightning Lou ambers?

Who wants to...
Hey, you're rocky marciano!

Lou ambers.
Good to meet you.

Good to meet you, too.
Yeah.

Yeah.

This is my buddy,
Allie colombo.

Hey, how's it going?

Good. I remember you
from when we were kids.

Swell, swell, real swell.
How's it going, champ?

Never better.
Never better.

Terrific.

You mind me askin'
what you're doin' here?

What, here?
It ain't so bad.

Pays the bills,
get to meet some good people.

Sure. Sure.

Al weill used to manage you,
right?

Well, let's just say I paid
for his house and 3 cars.

So he handled your money?

Oh, he handled it all right.

Didn't do such a good job, huh?

Oh, it wasn't his fault.

I was going through dough
like Hitler through Poland.

You know how it is. You... you... you
sign a deal when you're young,

it ends up chasin' you around
the rest of your life, huh?

You-you're tellin' me you've got
nothin' left from bein' champ?

I got memories, kid.
A lot of great memories.

And a case of the clap I can't
get rid of for the life of me.

I'll see you.

Take it easy.

It ain't right, Allie.

Guy like that fights
all those years,

he's got nothin'
to show for it?

What do you got?
Come on, pony up.

That's what I got.

I'll give it to him.

Say, Lou. It ain't much, but it's all we got.
Throw that in your kick.

You snotty little wops.

Oh.

I was lightweight champion
of the world, 1936!

Where the fuck do you get off?

Lou, I don't mean
to insult you...

I fuckin' work for a lmng!

I don't need your charity.
Get the hell out of here!

I'm sorry if we offended you...

I'm Lou ambers,

lightweight champion
of the world!

I'm not a charity case,
you bums!

I'm Lou fucking ambers!

You know, I ain't surprised..

Ambers was always
a little proud.

Punchy but proud.

I just can't believe
an ex-champ winds up

slingin' hash.
It's degrading.

Yeah? I got news
for you.

Worse can happen.

Say, this can't be.

Now, we saw him
just the other night.

He... he was buying drinks
and everything.

It seems the bomber
got himself into a corner

he can't box out of.

Says here he's into the I.R.S.
For a cool million!

Not counting the $500,000
that he's defaulted on loans,

$200,000 in alimony to his ex.

It's a long list.

This don't make sense.

He was champ for a dozen years.

He was fightin' for the big
paydays since the 30's.

Not to mention all the
businesses and advertisements.

Yeah. Millions of dollars
and no sense.

Hey, Freddy! Try this on!

I got the other papers
right in front of me, right.

I'm gonna take a look.

I want my money.

What are you going on about?

I'll call you back.

My half. The half you've been
investing for me. I want it.

What, do you need some
walking-around money? $50, $100?

I'm not talkin'
about chump change.

I'm talkin' about my half.

What's going on, Allie?

The man wants his money, Al.

Show me my file.

Your file?

There ain't no file.
It's all up here.

Hey, I got to answer to you, you
ungrateful son of a bitch?

It's the other way around, pal!

I signed you when
no one would touch you!

I want my money, God damn it!

Easy now, easy.

It ain't all in one place,
you know.

I got it spread around
in investments.

Like what?

Well, we got $60,000 in an
apartment building in the Bronx.

I trusted you with my money
and you put it in the Bronx?

Hey, come on, you knew we were
investing in real estate.

Don't act so innocent.

I want out.

Well, you can't get out.

We used the apartments
as collateral

for the parking lots
in Syracuse.

Syracuse?

Which are tied into development
properties in Florida,

overseen by the partnership
in Maine.

Oh, skip the birdseed, weill!
What am I worth in cash?

Well, things didn't pan out
exactly as I'd hoped.

Just give me a few months,
I got a couple of...

Cash me out! I'll handle my
own finances from now on.

You? What do you know
about money?

I know what I don't got!

All right, fine.
You want it, you got it.

I still get half of everything you
make for the rest of your life.

Yeah, yeah,
don't worry about it!

Just worry about my title shot.

Did you even call up
ezzard Charles' people yet?

Title shot? You fought lastarza
like you were wearing a skirt!

He won that fight, all right?

Well, tell that
to your friend, carbo!

He's the one pullin'
the strings, right?

And I'll tell you
one thing, though.

We're lucky if they even call
us before November, December.

I'm not fightin'
till the end of the year?

That's right.

Oh, no, Al.
No, no, no, no, no.

Set me up with a... with an exhibition
or some... call those wrestling people.

Wrestling? What's the matter with you?
Are you outta your mind?

It's like stepping over
dollars to pick up a dime.

.

Crooked again.

You know why the ball
goes crooked?

'Cause you don't got
those oyster shells

to make it roll straight,
right?

How you know that?

You told me
when I was little, pop.

.

Listen, pop, I gotta talk
to you about something.

Sure.
What's on your mind, rocco?

Well, it turns out I don't have
as much money saved as I thought

and I didn't clear what I expected
from the lastarza fight.

What's wrong?

I just don't think you ought to give
notice at the factory just yet.

And, uh, as far as
payin' off the house,

maybe we ought to hold off
on that as well.

It's just temporary,
you understand,

but I'm makin' some investments
and tryin' some things out.

With the money I got right
now, I... i don't...

It's ok, rocco.
I understand.

Do you, pop?

Sure. Sure.

Thanks, pop.

Well, you know, I never would
have asked you, right?

But those Brooks brothers jerks
down at every bank downtown.

They say I don't have the
collateral for a loan that size.

So I says to them, "if I had
the fucking collateral,

I wouldn't need
the fuckin' loan."

It's tough doin' business
with people you don't know.

Which is why
I'm gonna help you out.

No shit? You'll do it?

Yeah, but let me make it clear.
This isn't a loan.

I'm investing in your business.

Hey, all I want
is $5,000, rock.

You get $7,500
back in 10 weeks.

And 5 percent of the take.

And you won't be sorry.
It's gonna be real classy.

Like, I-I'm gonna add another dining
room and expand the kitchen.

I got my eye
on this chef from Boston...

Eddie, my father eats here
for free.

Sure, rock.
Where do I sign?

We don't sign.

The minute I put anything
down on paper,

my thieving manager comes
around for his 50 percent.

This is between you and me.

It's between you and me.

Give me a cup of coffee.

.

Hello.

<i>Hi, Barb? .</i>

Hey. Where are you?

I'm in Chicago.

All right, rocky!

<i>What are you still doin' there? I
thought you were comin' home. .</i>

Uh, yeah, I know what I said, but
I... i gotta go to Vegas first.

<i>I'll be home in plenty
of time for tomorrow. .</i>

Come on, baby. You know how
much this means to me.

Barb, this is
the last time ever, I promise.

This is the big one.

<i>$25,000, cash. That's enough
to put us where we wanna be.</i>

I just want us to be together.

We will be.

<i>Film of Joe
Louis' statement to the press .</i>

<i>Prior to his hospitalization
in Denver. .</i>

<i>I never did
nothin' to nobody. .</i>

Um, Barbara, I'm late.
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

<i>So I didn't understand .</i>

<i>Why all these tricks was
bein' played on me. .</i>

<i>I'm bein' locked up here .</i>

<i>For reasons
other than you think. .</i>

<i>I just want
certain people to know .</i>

<i>That they're
the real ones who need help. .</i>

<i>Another fighter
pays the steep price, life...</i>

So, you hear about Louis?

Oh, yeah, it's a shame.
He's a hell of a guy.

Yeah.

I can't believe a guy like that
winds up in some loony bin.

You know, after everything he did for
the government during the war,

then they gotta turn around and
take every last penny he's got?

I'll tell you, rock.

You were smart to get out
of it when you did.

Did we pass Denver yet?

Congratulations, rock!

Go, Barbara!

Hey, rocky!
Only one piece, right?

I'm surprised he doesn't want
50 percent of the cake, too.

Yeah. They gotta make a new
class for me, Al. Overweight.

I'd like to propose
a toast to the newlyweds!

May your love last
from bell to bell.

<i>To life!</i>

.

Drink, drink, drink.

Uh, rocky,.

Rocky, you, uh, you got yourself
a beautiful bride there.

And Barbara. What can I say?

You'd have been
better off buyin' a dog.

.

No, no, no,
seriously, though, Barbara,

I would like
to officially welcome you

as the newest cornerman
in the marciano camp.

As we slug our way to the
heavyweight title of the world!

Rocky, you're gonna do it!

Oh, and, uh,
while we're on the subject,

I would like
to tell everybody here

that just a few moments ago,
I received a phone call

formalizing rocky marciano's
next bout.

All right. 3 months from tonight,
in Madison square garden,

the brockton blockbuster
will face

none other than the legendary
brown bomber, Joe Louis!

Go get him, rocco..

How could you
do this to me, Al?

Look, look. Louis
retired with the belt.

The second he unretired, they made
him the number one contender.

This is an opportunity
you cannot pass up.

No, listen, walcott, Charles.
Anybody but Louis!

Fighting Louis is the only way

you'll get them to forget
about the lastarza mess.

I beat lastarza!

You want a shot at the title?
Yeah.

Fine. Beat Louis.

Beat Louis? I'm not even
gonna fight Louis.

Listen, you ungrateful punk,

this is not about you,
what you want.

I've got a lot invested in you
and it's time I got paid.

You don't wanna fight Louis?
Fine..

You go down there and you tell your
family you're finished with boxing

and you're movin' back home.

Maybe you can take your old
man's job at the shoe factory.

.

Beautiful wedding,
Mrs. marchegiano.

<i>Complimenti. .</i>

What's goin' on, huh?

I don't know how much clearer I could be.
I gotta start trainin' now.

Yeah, but the fight's not for 3
months, and we just got married.

Most people who just got married
go on a goddamn honeymoon!

Yeah, well, most people
don't have to fight Joe Louis!

Pop, I gotta go to the camp.

Sit with me for a moment, huh?

I gotta go.
I gotta leave.

It's for you.

I gotta go.

.

Well, now, me and the others are
stayin' here in the main house.

See the cottage over there?
That's for you.

I want you should have your rest, you know.
Your privacy. Whatever.

And, um, that's your, uh,
gym equipment over here.

Look, regulation ring.
The works.

Yeah, and you got the prince
of wales comin' up to spar.

How much of this is
comin' out of my end?

Nothin'. Carbo made a deal
with the owners.

What, he agreed not to bump 'em
off if they packed up and left?

I still wanna see
all the bills.

This is the only
time Louis got knocked out..

See how he drops his left?

Look how he leaves himself wide
open for the overhand right.

You try to outbox Louis,
he'll tear your head off.

You gotta stay low and close.

Never let him catch you
in the center of the ring.

You let him stay a foot and a
half away, he'll murder you.

And when that opening
finally comes,

you gotta throw that right
hand with everything you got.

That's enough, Allie.

No, Allie.
Let it run.

I want to see this one, too.

This don't mean nothin'.
It was a 1,000 years ago.

Oh, yeah..

He's still the best boxer
that ever lived.

You give him half a chance, he'll carve
you up like a thanksgmn' bird.

Goodnight, Irene.

Give me another mile.
One more mile..

Time, time. Time!

Hey, where you goin'?

That's it.
I'm done for the day, man.

2 more. Come on.
2 more. 2 more.

Take a break, rock. Cool down.
You've already got 10 rounds.

You. In!

Good, good, good, good, good.

Now! Come on!

What's wrong with you? You ain't
said nothing in 12 Miles.

That son of a bitch,
brockton Eddie.

What about him?

He's into me deep and I ain't
seen a dime in months.

Put it out of your head. Ain't
nothing you can do about it now.

Yeah, but you can.

What are you
talking about, rock?

I want you to go home
to brockton.

I want you to get me my money.

What are you talking about,
rocco?

I'm helping you get ready
for a fight here.

Best thing you can do to help me
is to go home and get my money.

Why are you talkin' to me like that?
Get me my money!

Rock. Hey, rocco.

Charlie says
you're lookin' good, kid.

So you gonna take him?

Hey, rocco.

Take a break.
I'm talkin' to you.

.

So that's how
it's gonna be, huh, kid?

Hi. I'm rocky marciano,

and I'm here at my greenwood
lake training camp

preparing for my upcoming bout
with the great Joe Louis

on October 23
at Madison square garden.

I sure hope you all come down
and see the fight.

I know you won't be
disappointed if you do.

Hey, rocky, you really
think you can beat Louis?

Well, I'll certainly
try my hardest.

Cut.

.

Thanks, rocky.
That was great.

Yeah. It's great
to meet you, too.

Hey, uh, do you think I could get
your autograph? It's for my kid.

Did you get the money?

I tried, rocco. I get to town,
that jerk-off, Eddie...

Did you get the money?

No. I don't know
what to tell you.

Tell me? Tell him I want the money.
I'm supposed to get...

Excuse me, Mr... Mr. marciano.
Uh, we're leavin' now.

Okay, great,
it's nice to meet you.

Hey, good luck in the fight.

Thanks a lot. I'm supposed to
get 5 percent of his action.

Personally, I can't wait to see you
go out and kill that big <i>moolie. .</i>

You wanna excuse us
for a second?

What'd you say? No, wait, I wanna hear this.
What should I do to this guy?

I'm just sayin', if you
can do half the damage

to that nigger
that you did to vingo...

You wanna see me hurt someone?

Rocco, rocco.

You wanna see me kill someone?

Rocco! Take it easy!

Rocco, rocco.
My car, man!

What are you doin'?

Look what you did.
Get out of here! Go!

Maybe we should've booked him
to fight Louis' Cadillac.

Look, see, now it's stuck.
What is he...

Heard you almost went the
distance with a car.

What are you doin' here?

I'm sorry.

I miss you so much.

All they're talkin' about back
home is you fightin' Louis.

You know, I like the guy
I'm fightin' against

more than the guys
I'm fightin' for.

You know, it's guys like carbo
give us all a bad name.

They think Italians
are all gangsters.

They forget about men
like my father, you know.

Anyone can handle it,
it's you, rock.

I gotta beat this guy. I got... i got
so many people countin' on me.

You'll find a way to win.
You always do.

Well, if I lose this Friday, I'm
not gonna have anything left.

You'll still have me.

I love you, Barbara.

I love you so much.

.

Let go of me!
Let go of me!

Excuse me.

Yes.

I need to see Joe Louis.

No visitors
but immediate family.

He'll wanna see me.
I'm rocky marciano.

All right!

.

Goddamn.
Kid came to fight.

You just went 3 minutes with the
greatest boxer who ever lived.

How does it feel?

Like I got hit by a truck.

He's so fast, I can't see half
of his punches comin', Charlie.

Well, you know what the cure
for that is, don't you?

Hit him before he hits you!

<i>Here we go with round 2. .</i>

<i>So far, it's anybody's fight.</i>

<i>He's in here.</i>

.

<i>According to
my unofficial scorecard, .</i>

<i>After 6 rounds,
Louis is slightly ahead. .</i>

<i>But as the rounds mount up, .</i>

<i>Marciano seems
to be getting stronger.</i>

.

<i>Louis caught marciano
with that one. It's hurt him. .</i>

<i>He hangs in there, but that punch
caught marciano by surprise. .</i>

He's hurt me.
He's hurt me.

He's lettin' his left drop. Hang a few
upstairs, and let's get this over with.

He's dead on his feet, rock..

One good shot's
all it's gonna take.

<i>One good shot.</i>

.

<i>And Louis is down!
Louis is down! .</i>

<i>The crowd is on
its feet screaming. .</i>

Go to the corner!

<i>A devastating left
from marciano...</i>

...2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

You all right, Joe?

.

<i>And it's over!</i>

.

<i>Marciano has done it! .</i>

We win! We win!
Rocco beat Louis!

.

Rock, is it really you?

It's me, Joe.

What happened?

You punch hard, kid.

I need to ask you a question..

What happened to me?

I'm sorry, Joe.

I... i never wanted
to have this fight.

I never wanted to fight you.

I'd... if it was 10 years ago,
I wouldn't have...

You would've been a match.

You're gonna win
that title, marciano.

I got no doubt.

You're a winner.

But let me tell you somethin'.

I won, rock.

I won

till I had nothin' left
in my life but winnin'.

I won my wife away,

I won all my money gone,

my family.

You got people who love you?

Yeah.

Don't ever let 'em go.

They say you're crazy.

I ain't crazy.

I just got nothin' left.

Spoke to you
about that yesterday..

Yes, doctor.

Just bring in your
time kits as usual.

Excuse me.

Mr. marciano, I've always
been a big fan of yours.

I'm the administrator
of this hospital...

Say, pal, uh, don't you know
you got Joe Louis in there?

I mean, can't we find a better
room for him around here?

I'm sorry, Mr. marciano,
but he's indigent.

This is the best
the state can provide.

Well, uh.

Jensen, that man in there
is a friend of mine.

Make sure he's looked after.

But, sir, I...

<i>Be home the next
flight I can catch, Barbara.</i>

<i>3, 4 hours, tops. .</i>

And I'm home to stay.

What happened to Vegas?

Oh, it don't matter.
I'm comin' home.

.

They're following you.

Hey.

Hi.

Hi, Mrs. abodenzas.

.

Mr. andriole!
Open the gate!

Rocco! You got it.

.

What're you doin' here?

Come on, pop.
You've made your last shoe.

Rocco. Rocco..

What will you do now? All these
people, they come to see you.

What is all this?

I got the oysters for you, pop.

We'll crush 'em up and make
you a real <i>bocce court. .</i>

This is my son.

.

Hey, Mr. marciano.
I gotta tell you.

I have never flown in anything this bad.
And I don't think we should.

Come on, kid, I've flown
in worse than this.

I gotta get home.
Let's go.
