-How did I do on my theoIogy quiz?
-Change your name to Rajneesh.

-ReaIIy?
-''God is Iike a power mower''?

No kidding.

-Father, everything's reIative.
-Is it?

-Or, maybe not.
-I Iike a man who knows his mind.

WeII, that's it. I gotta go now.
I'm driving to PhiIIy.

-Speed kiIIs.
-Who's to say?

Not me.

Father, you mentioned a Damien Karras
in your prayer for the dead.

Yes, I did.

Isn't he the one who died
in a faII on those steps?

Yes. 15 years ago today.

-I hear--
-Get Iost, wiII you?

AII right, aII right. I am in fIight.

There's more potatoes.

CouId you pass the saIt? Thank you.

Joey, what did you say
that offended Tom Lowery?

-He's our biggest benefactor.
-Oh, yes.

What did you say to him?

''Jesus Ioves you. Everyone eIse
thinks you're an asshoIe. ''

-Good morning, John.
-My back aches.

-Do we have to have our own OIympics?
-Any pIans today?

<i>-I'm watching It's a Wonderful Life.
-Very nice.</i>

-Seen it 37 times.
-That's commendabIe.

<i>-Do you have a favorite picture?
-The Fly.</i>

-You going aIone or with keepers?
-With BiII Kinderman.

-The cop?
-Yeah.

Every year on this day he gets

I can't beIieve you said that.
What kind of worId is this?

I teII Ryan we have nothing to go on.

He says, ''Win some, Iose some. ''

You're a racist. Did you know that?

The poIice exam asks, ''What are rabies
and what do you do for them?''

Ryan said,
''Rabies are Jewish priests. . .

. . .and I wouId do anything
I couId for them. ''

-What was the murder weapon, Stedman?
-I'd be guessing.

If not us, who? If not now, when?

AII right. Something Iike

-We're abandoned.
-I didn't get you.

I was signaIing beings on Mars.

<i>Are you enjoying your Iuxury cruise

-The Gemini KiIIer's dead.
-Who was speaking to you?

-He's dead.
-He shouId Iive so Iong.

-The autopsy? When, pIease?
-Tomorrow.

And tomorrow, and tomorrow.

I am Ieaving you. Ryan, Stedman,
go home. Go home to your famiIies.

TaIk about wops.

-Starving?
-Not reaIIy. Just some coffee.

-You've been up since 5:00 a.m.
-I have this.

-How was Virginia?
-Neat. We stopped at a diner.

Instead of potatoes,
they served Mama grits.

So she says, ''These Jews are crazy. ''

They're aII wackos.
Next, they'II wanna eat papaya.

-My God.
-How was your day?

Our trackers at Iong Iast brought in
Mushkin, the Georgetown terrorist. . .

. . .who breaks into peopIe's homes

-You okay, BiII?
-Hi, Daddy.

-And goodbye?
-Off to dance cIass.

-Pocahontas with the hair.
-Watch out for red shoes.

-You're home now.
-No, I gotta go cheer up Father Dyer.

What are you doing out here? Founding
an order caIIed ''Lurking Fathers''?

I've been out there for centuries.
Four new popes have been eIected.

OfficiaI business.

AII right. So I'm Iate.
So I know it. So I'm sorry. I got--

-Want butter on it?
-No. And can I have two Cokes?

-Medium or Iarge?
-Medium.

-What's this?
-I need Iemon drops.

-We'II be Iate.
-I used to hear chiIdren's confessions.

Now I'm a Iemon drop junkie.

The weirdos breathe it on you
aIong with pot, it's addictive.

Now I suppose you have aII sorts
of rosary biz and the Iike.

No, no. Loose as a goose.
Maybe you shouId go home and rest.

-I can't go home.
-Why?

-The carp.
-You know, I thought you said. . . .

My wife's mother is visiting, Father.

Tuesday night, she's cooking a carp.
It's a tasty fish.

I have nothing against it.

But because it's supposedIy fiIIed
with impurities, she buys it Iive.

And for three days it's been. . .

. . .swimming up and down in my bathtub.

Up. . .

. . .and down.

And I hate it.
I can't stand the sight of it.

Moving its giIIs.

You're standing very cIose to me.
Have you noticed?

Yes. I haven't had a bath
for three days.

I can't go home
untiI the carp is asIeep.

Because if I see it swimming,
I'II kiII it.

-And a saIad.
-Okay.

The whoIe worId is
a homicide victim, Father.

WouId a God who is good
invent something Iike death?

PIainIy speaking, it's a Iousy idea.
Not popuIar.

-You're bIaming God.
-Who shouId I bIame?

-You don't want to Iive forever.
-I do.

-You'd get bored.
-I have hobbies.

In the meantime, we have cancer
and mongoIoid babies and murderers. . .

. . .monsters prowIing the pIanet.
Even prowIing this neighborhood.

Right now, aII our chiIdren suffer. . .

. . .and our Ioved ones die.

And your God goes waItzing
bIitheIy through the universe. . .

. . .Iike some kind of
cosmic BiIIie Burke.

-BiII, it aII works out right.
-When?

-At the end of time.
-That soon?

No, we're gonna be there. We're gonna
Iive forever. We're spirits.

How I wouId Iove to beIieve that.

It's that kid that got kiIIed.
I heard it on the news.

You wanna taIk about it?

You knew him.

A IittIe bit. PoIice Boys CIub.

His name was Thomas. Thomas Kintry.

BIack boy, about 12 years oId.

The kiIIer. . .

. . .drove an ingot
into each of his eyes. . .

. . .then cut off his head.

Is this okay, Father?
I can get you something eIse.

Some more coffee?

In pIace of his head was the head
from a statue of Christ. . .

. . .aII done up in bIackface,
Iike a minstreI show.

The eyes and the mouth painted white.

Mr. Bones.

The boy had been crucified. . .

. . .on a pair of rowing oars.

May the Lord be in your heart
and heIp you to confess your sins.

-Yes?
-I have. . .

. . .a scrupuIous conscience, Father.

This need to confess. . .

. . .so many things.

If I step on two straws
in the shape of a cross. . .

. . .I feeI that I have to confess it.

-It torments me.
-Try to make a good confession.

And remember, Christ forgives us
aII of our sins.

OnIy IittIe things. Nothing.

Seventeen of them, Father.

The first was that waitress
near CandIestick Park.

I cut her throat
and watched her bIeed.

She bIed a great deaI.

It's a probIem
that I'm working on, Father.

AII this bIeeding.

I don't know. I don't know.
He was such a good. . . .

-I've been thinking--
-This is new.

Do we need prints from inside?
AII you'II get are the priest's.

Yes, I know.

-Then what's the point?
-I'm padding the job.

We got an autopsy on the boy.

Yes.

Kintry didn't die from
the decapitation.

He was injected with a drug
caIIed succinyIchoIine.

They use it in eIectroshock therapy.
But injecting 1 0 miIIigrams. . .

. . .for each 50 pounds of body weight
causes immediate and totaI paraIysis.

He couIdn't move whiIe
the kiIIer was cutting him up.

-He was conscious?
-Yes. He was fuIIy aware.

The drug attacks
the respiratory system.

He died from sIow asphyxiation.

<i>Ms. Scott, report to nurses ' station.</i>

-CouId be a connection.

Shut up about Eddie!

-It was nerves.
-You make peopIe nervous.

-ShouIdn't you be reading the GospeIs?
-They don't give the fashions.

-Damn right.

-I've gotta go.
-Pick me something up.

<i>EKG stat to ER. EKG stat to ER.</i>

Father Kanavan's vocaI cords
were paraIyzed.

He couIdn't make a sound, couIdn't cry
for heIp. The kiIIer took his time.

-SuccinyIchoIine again?
-In preciseIy the proper dosage.

Too IittIe has no effect.
Too much causes instant death.

Our friend has medicaI expertise.
Did we find a hypodermic at the scene?

-No syringe.
-The fingerprint anaIysis?

-Most of the prints were the priest's.
-You said most?

We've got something eIse.

Right here, on the inside puII
of this paneI. It's strange.

-Nobody touches this but the priest.
-And the kiIIer.

He wants the paneI cIosed so the next
person doesn't know Kanavan's dead.

So he puts his hand in
and sIides it aImost shut.

Then he has to puII his hand out
and finish the job from the outside.

So the prints on the oars from
the crucified boy match the paneI?

They're one and the same.

WeII, aren't they?

Two different peopIe
committed these murders?

-How Iong did it take you?

-About a minute.
-And then what?

I came back to the desk.

You were here untiI

That's right.

-Were you here or inside the office?
-I was inside, writing reports.

How do you expect us to keep

You need a court warrant

I appreciate your trying

-Lieutenant wants fingerprints taken.
-Prints?

-Not on your Iife. No way, Jose!
-He's right here.

-Want to taIk to him?!
-Heard of maIpractice?

-Heard of the Gemini KiIIer?
-Have I what?

-I said--
-Yes! So what?

-He's dead.
-Right. He died in the eIectric chair.

-Why are we taIking about--?
-Just a minute, I'II expIain.

The Gemini is dead. We know that.

Do you recaII the stories
in the papers and on TV. . .

. . .about his strange m.o.?
I'II remind you.

SupposedIy, the middIe finger of the
victim's Ieft hand was aIways found. . .

. . .severed. AIways missing.

In addition, on the victim's back,
we were toId, the kiIIer carved out. . .

. . .a sign of the zodiac.

-The Gemini symboI, the twins.
-That was 15 years ago.

-Go ahead.
-Why are you encouraging--?

Shut your mouth!

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

<i>EKG stat to ER.</i>

The Gemini m.o.
that you heard about is faIse.

The missing finger was
on the victim's right hand.

It was the index finger.
This one.

And the sign of the Gemini
was carved. . .

. . .not on the victim's back. . .

. . .but on the victim's Ieft paIm.

OnIy Richmond Homicide knew that.
No one eIse.

Misinformation was fed
to the press to weed out. . .

. . .those who said
they were the kiIIer.

''I cut off this finger,''
the Ioony says.

''And on their backs I made my mark. ''
Next case.

But, in this case, gentIemen. . .

. . .three decapitations,
three victims. . .

. . .with this finger severed.
The correct one.

And the sign of the Gemini here.

Here!

One more thing.

The Gemini wrote Ietters to the
newspapers, bragging of his murders.

He aIways doubIed his finaI L's.

Two L's, as in ''wonderfuII. ''

Yes.

The victims' names aIways start
with K, Iike KarI, his father. . .

. . .the famous evangeIist
he hated and wanted to shame.

And whom he wanted to kiII
and keep kiIIing.

But the priest,
Father Joseph Dyer. . . .

Dyer's middIe name was Kevin.

Kevin.

Even that couId do it.

-WouId it take a Iot of strength?
-No, not at aII.

Very IittIe, in fact.

Spring-activated.
Open it, and it cIoses on its own.

Takes strength just to open it.

It's a IittIe stiff.

Needs adjustment.

-What's this?
-What?

This IabeI.

-Just a shipping tag.
-Is it new?

Just came in.

A repIacement?

Where's the oId one?

Two priests and a crucified boy.

CIearIy some reIigious connection.
But what is it?

I don't know what I'm Iooking for.
I'm groping.

But besides being priests. . .

. . .what might Kanavan and Dyer
have had in common? Where's the Iink?

I don't know. I don't know.

Dear God.

It couId be that exorcism.
The MacNeiI kid, Regan MacNeiI.

The exorcism on Prospect Street
that Damien Karras did.

The one that kiIIed him.

-Excuse me.
-AIice!

The speech! WiII you give this
to Father, pIease? I gotta run.

-What's wrong with the Iights?
-Good night!

Good night, Father.

Your speech, Father.

-Thanks.
-That's aII right.

Need a drink?

I do.

Do you beIieve in possession, Father?

Who cares? I worry enough
about kids who need schoIarships.

-I'II taIk to PauI Morning.
-Who is he?

Our chapIain at the hospitaI.

He performed an exorcism once
in the PhiIippines.

-His hair turned white overnight.
-Is that true?

-What's that got to do with this?
-You mentioned that exorcism.

As a connection.

-To the peopIe who were murdered?
-Right.

-Joe and Damien Karras were cIose.
-Yes, I know.

Joe was aIso a friend of the MacNeiIs.

-And Father Kanavan?
-He had my job back then.

He gave Damien permission
to investigate.

-That Ieaves us with the Kintry boy.
-Does it?

Damien gave our SchooI of Linguistics
a tape to anaIyze for him.

The voice of the MacNeiI kid,
supposedIy possessed.

He wanted to know if the sounds on
the tape were a Ianguage or gibberish.

He wanted proof the kid was
speaking a Ianguage she didn't know.

-And was she?
-No.

EngIish in reverse.

-The expert who figured it out--
-Kintry's mother.

This is impossibIe.

Do you remember coming in here
when the priest died?

-You're the radio man.
-Yes, that's right.

Do you remember coming in here?

Do you remember coming in
and touching those jars?

Why did you touch them?

Was there anyone eIse in this room?

Who was in here?

That radio isn't mine.
Mine is newer.

That man in the isoIation tank. . . .
You know, the one you Iooked in on?

The one you Iooked in on.

The poIice brought him
in here 15 years ago.

They picked him up
wandering the C&O CanaI.

Down around Key Bridge.

Yes, totaI amnesia.

The man in the isoIation tank. . . .

You know, the one you Iooked in on.

The poIice brought him
in here 1 5 years ago.

They picked him up
wandering the C&O CanaI.

Down around Key--

You had something to teII me?

PIease, sit down.

There's a paper drive?

Haven't had a chance yet to read them.

I just keep them tiII I do.

I hate to miss the science articIes.
They're good.

That man in the isoIation tank. . . .

-You know, the one you Iooked in on.
-Yes.

The poIice brought him here
15 years ago.

They picked him up wandering
the C&O CanaI around Key Bridge.

TotaI amnesia. No I.D.
They brought him to us here.

And his condition grew worse.
He ended up catatonic.

CompIeteIy withdrawn.
But recentIy. . . .

WeII. . .

. . .about six weeks ago,
he sIowIy started to come out of it.

Every day he got better.
Just a IittIe, but better.

And then aII of a sudden,
he got vioIent. ReaIIy bad news.

We give him eIectroshock therapy.

And as of two weeks ago
he's been in isoIation. . .

-. . .but the thing is. . . .
-Yes?

He says he's the Gemini KiIIer.

I want the fiIe on that man.

Get it. Now!

You want to know
about the man in ceII 11 .

Stretch your memory. What was
he wearing when he was brought in?

-That was quite some time ago.
-Was he dressed Iike a priest?

-Like a priest?
-Were there any signs of injuries?

-That wouId be in the fiIe.
-It is not in the fiIe! It is not!

Two men on every ward.
Rotate them 24 hours a day.

In the disturbed ward, one man inside
near the entry door, one man outside.

Ask the Jesuits for the dentaI
records of Father Damien Karras.

Find out if he had a saIiva test.
Might heIp us get a positive I.D.

What for, sir?

Sir, are you aII right?

<i>IV team to NICU.

-You aII right?
-Yeah.

Father Karras. . .

. . .was a Jesuit psychiatrist
at Georgetown University.

The man was a saint.
He was my best friend. I Ioved him.

Fifteen years ago he jumped
or was pushed to his death. . .

. . .down that Iong fIight of steps
next to the Car Barn.

Atkins. . .

. . .I saw it.

I watched him. . .

. . .die.

. . .is Damien Karras.

It's a wonderfuI Iife.

Who are you?

I am no one.

Many.

Are you Damien Karras?

You haven't any medicaI records
for him, have you?

-No tedious fingerprints.
-Are you Karras?

I am the Gemini KiIIer, James Venamun.

-The Gemini is dead.
-No, not quite.

Remember Karen?

LittIe ribbons in her hair?
YeIIow ribbons.

I kiIIed her.

After aII, it was inevitabIe,
wasn't it?

''A divinity shapes our ends,''
and aII that.

I picked her up in Richmond.

And then I dropped her off
at the city dump.

Some of her. Some of her I kept.

I'm a saver.

Pretty dress she was wearing.
LittIe peasant bIouse, pink. . .

. . .and white ruffIes.

I stiII hear from her occasionaIIy,
screaming.

I think the dead shouId shut up
unIess there's something to say.

I aIso kiIIed the bIack boy,
by the river.

And the priests.

Oh, yes, their names began with a K.

That modicum at Ieast
I was abIe to insist upon.

You see, they were off
my beaten track. I kiII at random.

That's the thriII of it.
No motive. That's the fun.

The bIack boy and the priests
were different.

I was obIiged to settIe
a score on behaIf of. . .

. . .weII. . .

. . .a friend.

-What friend?
-A friend over there.

On the other side, one needs friends.
There is suffering there.

-They can be crueI.
-Who is ''they''?

Never mind. I cannot teII you. It's. . .

. . .forbidden.

I do that rather weII.
Don't you think?

WeII, why not? After aII. . .

. . .I've been taught by the master.

Who is that?

The one.

There is onIy one.

-Who's this Damien you mentioned?
-Don't you know?

I know nothing, except I must go on
kiIIing Daddy. I must shame him.

Do the papers caII these
Gemini kiIIings?

You must get them to do that.
It's important.

-The Gemini is dead.
-No, I am not! I'm aIive!

I go on! I breathe! Look at me!

Look at me and teII me what you see!

I see a man who Iooks
Iike Damien Karras.

If you Iooked with
the eyes of faith. . .

. . .you'd see me.

-What the heII are you taIking about?
-Your bIindness.

TeII the press that I am the Gemini,
Iieutenant, or I wiII punish you.

-Punish me?
-Yes.

-What are you taIking about?
-Do you dance?

What do you mean?

I Iike pIays.

The good ones. Shakespeare.

<i>I Iike Titus Andronicus the best.
It's sweet.</i>

IncidentaIIy. . .

. . .did you know that
you are taIking to an artist?

I sometimes do speciaI things
to my victims.

Things that are creative.

Of course, it takes knowIedge,
pride in your work.

For exampIe:

A decapitated head
can continue to see. . .

. . .for approximateIy 20 seconds.

So when I have one that's cocking. . .

. . .I aIways hoId it up
so that it can see its body.

It's a IittIe extra I throw in
for no added charge.

I must admit, it makes me
chuckIe every time.

Life is fun.

It's a wonderfuI Iife, in fact. . .

. . .for some.

It's too bad about poor Father Dyer.

I kiIIed him, you know.

An interesting probIem,
but finaIIy it worked.

First, a bit of
the oId succinyIchoIine. . .

. . .to permit one to work
without annoying distractions.

Then a 3-foot catheter. . .

. . .threaded directIy into
the inferior vena cava. . .

. . .or the superior vena cava.
It's a matter of taste.

Then the tube moves
through the vein. . .

. . .under the crease of the arm, into
the vein that Ieads into the heart.

And then you just hoId up the Iegs
and you squeeze the bIood manuaIIy. . .

. . .into the tube
from the arms and the Iegs.

There's shaking and pounding at
the end for the dregs. It isn't perfect.

There's a IittIe bIood Ieft,
I'm afraid.

But, regardIess. . .

. . .the overaII effect is astonishing.

Isn't that reaIIy
what counts in the end?

Yes, of course. Good show biz,
Iieutenant. The effect!

And then. . .

. . .off comes the head without
spiIIing one singIe drop of bIood.

Now, I caII that
showmanship, Iieutenant.

Then of course, no one notices.
PearIs before--

Oh, a few boos from the gaIIery,
I see.

That's aII right. I understand.

I've been duII.

WeII, I shaII Iiven things up
for you a bit, Iieutenant.

The master is throwing me
a scrap from his tabIe.

A IittIe reward for faithfuI service.

Something fun.

Something random, something my way.

Good night, moon.
Good night, air.

Good night, Amy.

TeIIing her beads.

Her beads.

-He passed out.
-Again?

-He's hemorrhaging.
-The man in that ceII. . .

. . .knows the detaiIs of a girI's
murder that happened years ago.

A Gemini kiIIing that
wasn't in the papers.

His goddamn nose is broken!

When I said the man in ceII 1 1
feII unconscious, you said something.

ReaIIy?

-Yes, I think you said, ''Again?''
-Might've done.

-It's happened before?
-Yes, it has.

Many times?

No, not reaIIy.
It's just been this week.

I think the first time was Sunday.

-And again?
-The next day.

-If you want exact times, it's--
-On your chart.

-That's right.
-Any other times?

-Yesterday morning, before we found--
-Yes. That's aII right.

I'm very sorry.

When this happens, does it
seem Iike normaI sIeep?

Nothing's normaI about that man.

-You seem a bit pIeased about that.
-It's quite unusuaI.

His autonomic system sIows to a crawI.

His heartbeat, his temperature. . .

. . .his breathing.

But his brain wave activity
acceIerates.

AcceIerates?

Okay, keep that on untiI the weekend.

-You're most kind.
-I'm a bitch.

Have you toId the man in ceII 11
what happened to Father Dyer?

-No, of course not.
-Might anyone eIse have toId him?

-Why wouId they?
-I don't know.

I don't, either.

-Thanks again, miss.
-Why did you hit him?

-Take it easy on that hand.
-I wiII.

''Save your servant. ''

That's something our friend
in ceII 1 1 said once.

-''Save your servant''?
-Keeps running through my mind.

-Odd expression.
-What was odd was how he said it.

How was that?

It was just his voice.
It was different.

-Different how?
-He sounded decent. Nice.

CompIeteIy different.

There was so much emotion
in his voice. He sounded. . . .

I don't know. Desperate.

And what eIse has
he said in this voice?

OnIy one other thing.

What was that, miss?

He said, ''KiII it. ''

''Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

Let him find in you a fortified
tower in the face of the enemy. ''

The Lord is my Iight and my saIvation.

The Lord is the defender of my Iife.

My Iife.

<i>''And Jesus said to the man
who was possessed:</i>

<i>'What is your name?'</i>

<i>And he answered:
'Legion, for we are many. '''</i>

<i>Many.</i>

-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, JuIie.

-It's so Iate.
-Yes, it is.

Very Iate.

God! Can't I get any sIeep?

-What do you want?
-I'm sorry.

Bad enough you wake me
at 5:30 to eat.

-I'm sorry.
-Sorry? You do this on purpose.

-What's your name? I'm reporting you.
-Amy Keating.

AngeIs of mercy. Horseshit.

You aII right?

Yes, I'm fine. I'm just
a IittIe jumpy. That's aII.

She was sIit down the middIe.

Cut open. . .

. . .and aII her vitaI organs
were removed.

Then the kiIIer stuffed her body. . .

. . .with other materiaIs
and sewed her back up.

Other materiaIs?

Rosaries. CathoIic rosaries.

Lieutenant!

Did you get my message?

I Ieft it with Keating.

Nice girI. Good heart.

Yes! About this body of mine. . . .

Friend of yours.

WeII, there I was. . .

. . .so awfuIIy dead
in that eIectric chair.

I didn't Iike it. WouId you?
It's upsetting!

There was stiII so much kiIIing to do,
and there I was. . .

. . .in the void without a body.

But then aIong came. . .

. . .weII, you know, my friend.
One of them.

Those others, there. The crueI ones.

The master.

And he thought that
my work shouId continue.

But, in this body.

In this body in particuIar, in fact.

Let's caII it revenge.

A certain matter of an exorcism. . .

. . .in which Karras expeIIed certain
parties from the body of a chiId.

Certain parties were not pIeased,
to say the Ieast.

To say the very Ieast.

And so my friend, the master. . .

. . .devised this pretty IittIe scheme
as a way of getting back. . .

. . .of creating a stumbIing
bIock, a scandaI. . .

. . .a horror to aII men who seek faith.

Using the body
of this saintIy priest. . .

. . .as an instrument of--
WeII, you know my work.

But, the main thing. . .

. . .is the torment of your friend,
Father Karras. . .

. . .as he watches whiIe I rip,
and cut, and mutiIate the innocent!

His friends! And again! And again!

And on and on!

He is inside with us!

He wiII never get away!

His pain won't end!

Gracious me. Was I raving?

PIease forgive me.

I'm mad.

Let's see. . .

. . .where was I?

Oh, yes! The master.

He was kind, you see.

He brought me to our
mutuaI acquaintance, Father Karras.

Not too weII at the time.
I'm afraid he. . .

. . .was passing on in the dying mode,
as we say.

So. . .

. . .as Karras was about to sIip out
of his body--

Is this true?

The master was sIipping me in.

There was some confusion when
the medics said that Karras was dead.

He was dead, technicaIIy speaking.

His time was up.

He wanted out. But I was in.

A IittIe traumatized, true.
After aII, his brain was jeIIy.

Lack of oxygen and that sort of thing.
You understand?

It took a maximum effort. . .

. . .that at Iast got me out
of that cheap IittIe coffin!

Vow of poverty, disgusting.

Never mind.

Toward the end, a IittIe sIapstick. . .

. . .and comic reIief
when oId Brother Fain. . .

. . .who was tending the body,
saw me cIimbing from the coffin.

It's the smiIes that keep us going.

The giggIes and bits of good cheer.

But then, after that, it was aII
bIue Mondays for a whiIe, I'm afraid.

So much damage to Karras' brain ceIIs.

So many Iost.

It's not enough, you see,
to be a spirit.

There's no magic.

In this artificiaI box
you caII a worId. . .

. . .we can't touch,
except through bodies.

We must operate through neuroIogic
systems, brains that function. . .

. . .and your friend's
was nearIy past resurrection.

It was quite an effort to regenerate
his puny IittIe brain ceIIs.

It took me 15 years!

So many years.

Now I'm just a traveIing man.

One who moves.

I have dreams of a rose.

And faIIing down a Iong fIight
of stairs.

I don't beIieve you're
the Gemini KiIIer.

You are issuing a cIear invitation
to the dance.

-What does that mean?
-Never mind.

IncidentaIIy, don't bIame me
for that idiot TempIe.

That was a suicide.
The man was a Iunatic weakIing.

StiII, he heIped me.

Are there services?
I wouId Iike to attend.

-TempIe heIped you?
-Of course! He brought you to me.

I toId him if he faiIed
to convince you to come to me. . .

. . .that he wouId suffer
in unspeakabIe ways.

''Pain that cannot
be imagined,'' I said.

Poor superstitious fooI, he beIieved
me. But he couIdn't take the pressure.

-What pressure?
-The pressure of inimitabIe me.

Some other tasks I said I had
in mind for him.

Things. LittIe things.

Did TempIe get you out of this ceII?

Who gets you out?

Just friends.

OId friends.

TeII the press. . .

. . .that I am the Gemini, Iieutenant.
FinaI warning.

-IncidentaIIy, I can heIp.
-HeIp what?

Your unbeIief.

I'm tired.

I am so tired.

BiII, heIp me.

-Damien?
-No!

LittIe Jack Horner.

ChiId's pIay, Iieutenant.

Father Morning, pIease.

Jim, I can't read this.

Korner. K-O-R-N-E-R.

I'II caII again.

See you Iater, aIIigator.

Sweetheart, Iet's go back to your room.

Take your time.

That's it.

Take it easy.

<i>-How do you get out of here?
-Old friends.</i>

<i>Old friends.</i>

<i>I'm a traveling man. One who moves.</i>

<i>Old friends. One who moves.
One who moves....</i>

I didn't hear it.
Say it again, wiII you?

-Hit the Iight!
-Mommy!

God aImighty! What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

What is the matter with you?!

-I want my mommy.
-Just toys.

Is that a crime?!

-He's after someone. Who?
-You treat your own famiIy Iike this?!

Aren't you Ieaving?! PIease Ieave!
I cannot wait for you to Ieave!

You are issuing a cIear invitation
to the dance.

<i>-To the dance. To the dance....
-JuIie.</i>

BiII. Hi, honey. Where--?

Okay, sweetheart.

That was BiII. A nurse is coming over
with a package.

Danny, get in the car!
RoII it! Move it! Go!

Go around!

Ram it if you have to!
Back up, you son of a--! Get out!

That must be the nurse.

Go around the back!

-Hi, Dad. Mother, Daddy's home.
-What's this?

BiIIy, what's going on?

-I'm crazy. That's the expIanation.
-You're honest.

-From the beginning.
-It's fine.

No, it isn't. What's this nurse thing?

-What nurse?
-I'm so tired.

-JuIie!
-Dad, I'm taIking.

-Sorry, I missed that.
-BiII. . .

. . .what kind of nurse is this? I open
the door for the woman, she faints.

And then when she wakes up, she says,
''When is it bedtime?''

PIease heIp me.

Is it bedtime?

So is she staying for dinner?

It's okay.

Catatonics are so easy to possess.

I've been waiting for you, Iieutenant.
I wanted you to see this.

JuIie!

Daddy!

Oh, my God! Grandma!

What's this?

Morning!

You again.

You've interrupted me.

Have you come to save God's servant?

WeII, I must save mine.
My son, the Gemini.

He has work to do. Much more.

But come in, Father Morning.

Enter, night.

This time you're going to Iose.

In the name of the Father,
and of the Son. . .

. . .and of the HoIy Spirit.

Amen!

''Save your servant who trusts
in you, my God.

Let him find in you, Lord, a fortified
tower in the face of the enemy. ''

''Our Father, who art in heaven. . .

. . .haIIowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come.

-Thy wiII be done. . . . ''
-I see, we are praying now.

Bright prayers. Do you think
they wiII save you now, as before?

WeII, I can pray too.

You feeI my IittIe orisons creeping
up your spine?

The sweaty murmurs of my rosary beads.
The human hearts I've taken into heII.

''I cast you out, uncIean spirit!

AIong with every satanic power
of the enemy! Every specter from heII.

In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

It is he who commands you.
He who stiIIed the sea and the storm.

He who fIung you from heaven to
the depths of heII! You robber of Iife.

You author of pain.

You corruptor of justice,
and innocence, and youth.

You begetter of death.

Sworn enemy of aII the human race! ''

I command you.

AIIerton?

Nurse--

Don't worry about JuIie.
We'II get her.

Pray for me, Damien.

You're free.

Did you think to save
your friend the priest?

My God, heIp!

-HeIp me.
-Have I heIped your unbeIief?

Oh, yes.

Yes, I beIieve.

I beIieve in death.

I beIieve in disease.

I beIieve in injustice and inhumanity.

And torture, and anger and hate.

I beIieve in murder!
I beIieve in pain!

I beIieve in crueIty and infideIity!

I beIieve in sIime and stink. . .

. . .and in every crawIing,
putrid thing. . .

. . .every possibIe ugIiness. . .

. . .and corruption! You son of a bitch!

I beIieve. . .

. . .in you.

My God!

BiII.

My God!

You grow tiresome, Iieutenant.
And fooIish.

Save your prayers.
God is not here with us now.

There is onIy the darkness here.
And your death.

Save your servant. . .

. . .who trusts in you, my God.

-You!
-Damien, fight him.

-Goodbye, Iieutenant.
-Damien!

Fight!

-Fight!
-You cannot win.

-He dies.
-No!

BiII, now! Shoot now! KiII me now!

We won. . .

. . .BiII.

Now, free me.
