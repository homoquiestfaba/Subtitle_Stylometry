Nice house.

You own it?

The bank owns it.

Is Oscar home yet?

No.

Still at school.

Let me know when he gets back.

(ominous music)

Hey, mom.

Rob, Oscar's home.

Hi, honey.
Hey.

How was school?

Awesome, I got a B plus today
on my test.

Excellent.

Can I go play video-games?

I don't see why not.
Cool.

Hey, can you just do me a favor and

make sure you change out
of your school clothes?

Sure.

Slow down young man.

I had the right of way.

Oh, it's your world, huh?

(ominous music)

(electricity buzzing)


Help me!

Are you okay?

Is he okay?

(suspenseful music)

Oh God.

Oscar, can you help me
with this, sweetie?

Sure, mom.

(car revving)

Oh my God.

Did you run him over?
Oscar.

Are you okay, sweetie?

Oh my God, I don't know what happened.

The brake must have slipped.

Thank God, I got in the car in time.

Okay, so I'll see you tonight?

You know you shouldn't skip
the rest of the practice.

I have some things I have to do.

All right.

I'll see you tonight.

Okay, see you.

(suspenseful music)

(ominous music)

(glass breaking)

(ominous music)



Geez, I didn't know
you knew how to cook.

My dad taught me before he died.

Hey, there's something I think
we need to talk about.

Sure thing, sweetie, what's going on?


Stop drinking so fast.


I might have made
the coffee a little hot.

This is good, sweetie, what's in it?

Eggs spread in syrup.

Wait, what is this?

Powdered sugar.


Oh my God.

(coughing intensifies)

Oscar?

Oscar!

Help!

Oscar!


What'd you do?


(ominous music)

(snake rattling)

(gun firing)

What do you want me to do with it, boss?

Put it in the bag.


(gun firing)

[Boy's Voice] Dear Vincent.

I've been waiting to see
you for such a long time.

I'm up for a parole soon

and I think I have a good chance.

I like you, I've taken
a liking to science

but I also have developed
a love of writing.

I hope to see you soon.

Love, Oscar.

(suspenseful music)

(chainsaw revving)

(upbeat music)

Hey, Vincent.

This was mailed to
the school care of you.

Looks like it's been in
circulation for a while.

It's probably my brother Oscar.

Trying to cheese me
from getting the job.

I didn't know you had a brother.

Long story.

I'll see you at
the awards banquet tonight.

(crowd applauding)

It's been a pleasure for me and you guys

should really be proud of your kids.

They worked really hard.

It's a pleasure to teach them today,

it was so hard, and it's just
been a great experience.

So, anyway without further ado,

let's give out the warm welcome
waiting for them, all right?

The Most Valued Scientist award.

This year the award is going
to go to Miss Katie Anderson!

(crowd cheering)

Thank you all so much.

This team has really given me something

to look forward to this year,

and God, I can't speak for everyone.

But getting out of bed in the morning

and going to high school
can be the worst

experience of your life.

But this team has made me see past that.

It's given me a purpose,

a reason to get up, so thanks.

(crowd cheering)

That's it.

Thank you guys so much for coming.

It's been a great night.

(crowd cheering)

Hey, congratulations.

With my success?

Yes, and I will talk to you tomorrow.

Okay.
Yeah.

Anyway, I need you to...

Congratulations.

Thank you so much.

Congratulations.

Well, kiddo, it's time to go home.

Can I stay just a little longer?

Sure.

Okay.

But who are you gonna ride home with?

I can give her a ride, Miss Anderson.

[Mrs. Anderson]
Are you sure, Mr. Burton?


Well?

Bye.

Just drive safe.

Did you have fun up there?

Yeah.

Did you?

No, I was very nervous.

I hate speeches.

I was so nervous.

Your speech was a lot better than mine.

So why don't you just hang out and then

come to me before you leave,
I'll give you a ride.

Okay.
Right?

Cool, thanks.
You got it.

(ominous music)

Well, this is the end of the road.

Thanks for everything.

You're welcome.

Katie.

I probably shouldn't tell you this,

but I'm gonna tell you anyway.

What?

You're beautiful.

Oh...

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Oh sorry.

(ominous music)

(calm music playing on the radio)

* Does it ever seem like living *

* Slowly someone's life *

* But the day you don't *

Hey, what's up?

Where were you?

That's right, you had your
science nerd thing tonight,

didn't you?

I won Most Valuable Scientist award.

You won most valuable, what?

Oh God.

Just shut up, you're such a jerk.

I'm sorry, it's just I've never heard

of that award before.

Well you are an idiot.

So, are you gonna come over or what?

I don't know.

I could hardly move at practice,

I was so tired from last night.

Come on, pussy.

Shut it.

What are you, wet?

That sounds like
something a guy would say.

Well, are you coming over or not?

Do I have to call someone else?

Yeah, no I'll see you at midnight.

(rock music)

(chair falling over)

Shh!

What?

My parents.

So?

I thought you stood me
up 'cause I'm some kind

of a brain now.

The only change I notice is your tits

got a little bigger this year.

Wait hold on.

Come here.

Just slow down.

Katie.

Come here.

Stop!


What's wrong?

But, I mean,

when are we gonna get serious?

I've been fucking you for two years now,

you keep asking me the same question.

I know but only on the deal though.

What's up with that?

So what?

I like to keep
my private life to myself.

We both know you don't
keep anything to yourself.

Good night.

Yeah, fuck this.

Don't, big boy.

Are you fucking with me?

Not yet.

(ominous music)

* I don't know what you want *

* I don't know what I'm thinking of *

(phone ringing)

* If you're thinking of who I am *

* This evening you don't have a clue *

(phone ringing)

Hello?

What's up?

Nothing.

Can you come get me?

I'm still in bed.

Well, I mean not now but like later.

Maybe.

What's in it for me?

Come on.

Nothing.

Tell me a dirty little secret.

Let's see.

Okay.

I did it with Carl.

Again?

Big whop.

Give me the detail.

I thought of Mr. Burton.

You really are sick.

I'll be there at one.

And don't get your panties on a bunch

if I'm a little late.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I'm seeing Carl.

You're what?

I know, Katie's gonna
be really mad at me.

You have to tell her right away.

I can't.

If you don't I will.

(upbeat rock music)

All right, let's go back
to chapter four.

(upbeat rock music)

* Come on ladies let's dance *

Cute hair.


What's going on?

What's wrong?

I accidentally told everyone
you're fucking Amy and Carl.

Are you serious?

No I'm fucking with you.

Goddamnit, Kathy.

Can't believe I fell for that shit.

You are such trailer trash.

Yeah, well at least I haven't fucked

everyone in the trailer park,
you stupid slut.

(ominous music)

(class bell ringing)

All right, so everybody's here
which is awesome.

So this week we are
going to be talking frog.

(class giggling)

So, tell me, I guess you speak frog?

So anyway if you notice
there's frogs in front of you.

We are going to be
doing some dissecting.

Does anybody want to guess

what the largest internal
organ is in a frog?

Merideth?

The largest internal organ
in a frog is their liver.

Correct.

All right let me peel back
the skin and muscle tissue

and pin it to the cork board.

(class bell ringing)

Get off your gloves.

Thank you, Tommy.

Put it in the garbage can.

(indistinct chatter)

Well that was a good lesson.

Yeah, it was a lot of fun, huh?

Hey, congratulations on the award.

Thank you, it was nothing.

Oh.

State Science Teacher
of the Year is nothing?

Come on, Vincent.

It must feel pretty good.

Well, maybe a little bit.

I'm gonna have an assembly
so the whole school

can celebrate.

By Katie.

Bye.

Let's do it.

Thank you so much.

Thursday.

Thursday works.

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Hey, Marge, it's me.


I just wanna let you know
I'm running a little late.

What's going on?

We have installed a new
computer system today.

It's gonna help us track down fugitives,

but she's gotta give me a rundown.

Can't it wait until tomorrow?

Come on, honey, I'll cook.

What are you gonna make?

How does steak tartar sound?

Raw?

All right, I'm gonna stop
by the butcher shop

on the way home.

All right, bye.

All right.

I got some time.

Why don't you give me the rundown
on this internet thing?

It's a T1 internet connection actually.

How's that different from before?

We had a dial up connection.

Oh yeah.

Now we get background checks faster

and we can get on the paper site

and look up public records.

That's gonna help.

What's going on, Katie?

I don't know, you tell me.

What are you talking about?

The whole school is talking about it.

Jennifer Johnson is the whole school?

Screw you.

You want to?

Right now?

You kept our relationship a secret

to try and get with my best friend.

I'm not.

We're done.

(suspenseful music)

Mr. Burton?

Yes, Katie?

with you alone.

I need to talk to you.


My family owns a cabin
just outside of town.

I've been needing to get out there

and clean the place up,

make sure everything's all right.

Why don't you come and meet me there?

We can talk.



Just take route three
out to Burton Meadow.

Hey, Liberty Base, I'm just
finishing up my patrol here.

I'm on the east fork
of Old Country Road.

[Woman On Radio] Over.

(ominous music)

So you used to live here
when you were younger?

Yeah, my father grew up in Liberty.

This was a family summer cabin.

Oh yeah?

That must have been lonely
with no kids around.

Well there is my brother.

What's his name?

Oscar.

So would you ever wanna
have a family someday?

Well, do you mean kids?

Yeah.

I don't know why you
wanted to ask me this, do I?

Yeah.

Forget it.

Do you wanna show me your bedroom?

I got you, I got you.

(upbeat music)

I don't wanna hurt you.

This isn't my first time.

(ominous music)

I'm ticklish.

(fire crackling)

Hey, the wind's picking up out here.

(ominous music)

(fire crackling)


Base, I'm gonna check out a fire,

the cabin on Burton Meadow.

It could just be a burn pile
but I'm at a weird angle here.

[Woman On Radio] Roger that.

(fire raging)


(siren wailing)

Is anybody else in the cabin?

Vincent, is anybody else in the cabin?

No.

(ominous music)

Vincent?

I told John about you coming
over for dinner tonight.

How's seven o'clock sound?

Sounds great.

John's in early patrol so he should be

home sometime after six?

Okay.

(indistinct chatter)

(bell ringing)

I have individual points
more than anybody else

in the state right now.

(ominous music)

All right guys, stop the chatter.

Let's start off where we left last week

about internal organs.

Tommy?

How about stop making out?

How about stop talking, all right?

I know you guys probably much rather

talk about external organs, all right?

These are frogs we're talking about.

So not that's any of my business but

do you have any idea how this

cabin fire could have started?

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Oh hi, Deb.

So, Vincent, I'm curious.

You want these people
that's a vegetarian

'cause you wanna eat a healthier diet,

or does it have some sort
of moral conviction?

It's a good question.

Both.

You ever been hunting?

My God.

You sure she's not in
one of her friend's?

I will.

I will tell him right now of course.

All right.

Good night, Deb.


That was Debbie Anderson, Katie's mom.

Apparently Katie's went to
Jennifer Johnson's house

last night and then she didn't come home

after school today.

Now Debbie's absolutely terrified

that something's happened
to her daughter.

Remember that call I got about
two months ago?

Neighbor said someone was
screaming out at night.

I drove all the way out there.

It was the Johnson's TV
turned up too loud

'cause Kathy was passed out
on the remote.

I guess it was a night off.

Was Jennifer in class today, Vincent?

Yeah, Jennifer was in class.

So I'm gonna have to go
talk to the Andersons

before it gets too late.

You know, John, I could
compile a list of students

you might wanna talk to,

you know, just in case
they know anything about Katie.

Yeah, that'd be great, Vincent.

I'll come by and talk
to you in the morning.

Drive careful and I'll save
you some dessert.

Is there meat in it?

No.

Then don't bother.

And I didn't forget about
your cabin, Vincent.

I'll come by tomorrow afternoon.

I'll take you up there if you want,

see if there's anything you can salvage.

All right.

Good night.
Good night, babe.

(ominous music)

Hey.

You Jennifer Johnson?

Yes, sir.

You wanna get in the car?

Katie Anderson stay at
your house last night?

Yeah, I mean, it's my dad's house.

You know where she is?

No, she was gone when I woke up.

You know where she went?

I thought she was with Carl Pierce.

All right.

That's all.

Where were you, Jenny?

I was worried about you.

What's her name?

Your slutty friend.

Katie.

(ominous music)

Her mother called, she can't find her.

I'll let you go pass out,

puke all over yourself again.

Fucking witch.


(phone ringing)

Hey, what's going on?

Hanging out with Carl.

What's up with Katie?

She really sucker something at.

I mean I heard she spent the night
at your house last night.

Yeah, I mean we just like
watched movies and stuff.

I heard this rumor that Katie's

seeing this way older guy.

And the only person
that she told was you.

Who told you that?

Am I wrong?

She was seeing someone.

But she swore me to secrecy.

Come on, baby.

You can tell me.

Didn't we swear not to tell secrets?

I swear to God, Jennifer.

Okay, but you can't
tell another living soul.

Come on, just tell me.

Jen?

I think she freaking hung up on me.

The service out here sucks.

(ominous music)

Great work on the dissection, guys.

Everybody who participated passed.

Just goes to show you
how far willing participation

will take you.

(bell ringing)

Wait, I need to take attendance.

Well, as I'm sure you're aware

Katie Anderson's still missing.

Spoke to the parents last night,
they're not doing so well.

Debbie Anderson's a complete wreck.

She's already convinced her
daughter's been kidnapped.

And Marge reminded me
I'm supposed to come down

and pick you up to take you
up to see your cabin today.

I remember what you said
about compiling a list

of Katie Anderson's friends.

I figured I'd get me two
birds with one stone.

I went to the cabin last night.

It's a strange thing, I don't
remember any of it at all.

You're pretty out
when I dragged you away.

Yeah.

But I don't remember any of it.

It's just total blank.

Could be smoke inhalation.

Maybe come back to you
when you see daylight.

Let's go take a look.

What do you know about Katie Anderson?

Well the first one's
our real connection.

You know, she's charming.

Good student, all around
great kid really.

Word on the street, as they say,

is that Katie's known around school

as one of the big party
animals in senior class.

Yeah, I've heard all those
rumors you're talking about.

I happen to know that they're not true.

In fact I could put you in contact

with her ex-boyfriend who's responsible

for spreading those lies.

Who's that?

Carl Pierce, a senior class jock.

He's had a crush on Katie since
they were in the 8th grade.

(ominous music)

Looks like it was a pretty nice bike.

I don't recognize it.

What's that?

I guess it was.

You never did answer
my question last night.

I asked you if you ever gone hunting.

No.

I'm not a hunter.

[Woman On Radio]
We have a report of a homicide

in the town limits.

You must report to
13 Johnson Road, immediately.

(ominous music)

Liberty One, I'm on my way, over.

Homicide I gotta go back in.

I'm gonna stay here and
look through the rubble

to see if I can find something else.

Didn't you come here last night?

It's too dark, I couldn't see anything.

This will help you dig.

I'll come back in a few hours.

If I can double back myself
I'll send somebody else.

Don't forget me out here.

(ominous music)

(siren wailing)

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

You have to help my sister.

You have to help my sister.

Calm down, calm down.

My sister, please help my sister.

What's going on?

(ominous music)


What do you mean she's okay?

Get away from me!

Oh my God.

Bullshit, officer.

Nobody tells me nothin'.

You see anything?

Officer.

Officer!

I told you this is gonna happen.

Children running wild around here.

This place is a mess.

This is Liberty One.

I need forensics and a body bag
out on Johnson Road.

[Woman On Radio] Copy that.

What's the situation?

I've never seen anything like it.

It's a goddamn bloody mess in there.

Could you also send my wife
to pick up Vincent

at the Burton Cabin?

I hate to do it but
this is gonna take all day.

She'll love you for it.

(ominous music)

Vincent.

Vincent, are you okay?

What's going on?

John sent me to get you.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I don't know, I just passed out.

No bumps or scratches?

No.

(ominous music)

(thunder rumbling)

Oscar?

[Woman On Comms]
Carl Pierce, Principal's Office please.

Carl Pierce, the office please.

I wonder what he did now.

What did I do?

I didn't say that
you did anything, Carl.

I just wanna talk to you.

Well, where were you two nights ago?

I was making home movies
with my girlfriend, Sheriff.

Your ex-girlfriend's
been missing for three days

and she's been presumed dead.

And as you probably know her best friend

was just found stabbed to death

in her own bedroom two nights ago.

So those would be some
pretty sick movies, Carl.

Now, 7:45 two nights ago,
where were you?

Night practice, season starts
in two weeks.

Coach gonna verify that?

Yes.

Yes, officer.

Well it was really nice
talking to you, Carl.

You're free to go.

How you doing, coach?

Pretty good, how's it going?

I just got one question for you.

Was Carl Pierce at night
practice two nights ago?

Yes, he was.

All right, coach, that's all, thanks.

It's not him.

I mean, he's got a problem
with authority,

but his alibi's clean.

Cellphone covered in blood in his pocket

but it's not him?

Look, there was no blood

on the inside of the coat pocket.

It was only the cellphone.

That means that the blood
on the phone was dry

when it was placed in Carl's pocket.

Placed?

It's gotta be a setup.

That's the only thing
that's making any sense

to me at this point.

Unless Carl gave his locker
combination to somebody.

The only way that someone can get in

is through the secured
files in my office.

And only faculty members have keys.

I am the janitor so I do
have keys to the school.

I wasn't here on the September 5th.

See, I was with my wife.

It's our anniversary.

Go ahead, you can call her if you like.

I will.

Anything else?

No, not right now.

You're free to go.

[Woman On Coms]
Amy Jones, please report

to the Principal's Office.

Amy Jones.

God, I don't know.

This is a small town and cellphones

get shitty reception, you know.

I mean, how was I supposed to know?

I know how hard this is for you.

I just can't believe this has happened.

I need you to tell me if there's anyone

who might have been upset with Jennifer

or with Katie for any reason.

Katie told Jennifer that
she had a new boyfriend.

I really wanted to know who it was.

That's enough.

Okay.

You're free to go.

How's interrogation going?

Amy's pretty shaken.

How's your head?
What?

Oh it's fine, thanks.

So, did she give you
any useful information?

She was as useful as she can be

under the circumstances.

It's not everyday
a teenage girl finds out

her two best friends have been murdered.

I thought Katie was just missing?

Her parents called
last night devastated.

They said they notice that
her bike had been missing.

It's been over two days.

They think she might have
been hit or abducted.

I gotta be going, I'm sorry.

But I think it'll work itself out.

Vincent, you forgot your...

Your papers.

Excuse me.

(ominous music)

Amy, over here!

Hey.

Hey.

How's that practice, huh?

Let me give you a ride home.

I was just gonna call my mom.

You'll be fine, let me give you a ride.

Okay.

(car revving)

(ominous music)


What are you doing?

You know, I can walk
the rest of the way.

I wanna ask you something, Amy.

Do you know who Katie was seeing?

No.

No idea who she was seeing?

I don't know.

Sorry.

Why are you sorry?

It's just a question, that's all.

I thought I was giving you a ride home?

Yeah, well, Vincent said he didn't mind.

Who?

My science teacher.

Since when do you call your
teachers by their first names.

Since he's someone that's
actually there for me.

I want you to come inside
and not leave this house

until the cops have
all this figured out.

But I mean I can't even...

You heard your mom.

Dad?

Your mom's already started dinner.

Thank you for giving my daughter
a ride home, Mr. Burton.

Prints come back?

We should get something
back by tomorrow.



Where the fuck am I?

This is the make out spot.

Don't you remember how many times

you took Katie here?

What are you gonna do, man?

Please.

Please, don't hurt me.

Shh!

I'm not gonna hurt you, Carl.

I don't wanna die.

I just need you to
fill out some paperwork.

Don't worry.

I've got a pen.


Now I want you to listen very carefully.

I would hate to do the other leg

knowing how important
football is to you, sport.

I need you to fill out a little report

and sign your name.

You can do that, can't you, Carl?

I know you can.

And do you know how I'm sure?

Because I've got Katie's dead body

with your baby inside of her.

Now you're gonna write
down every last word.

Put your hands out, get this pen.

Or it'll be your last breath.

Here, let me help you out.

Let me help you out.

Now start writing.

(car exploding)


(ominous music)

(knocking on door)

(knocking on door)

Oh, hey Vincent.

Hey, Marge.
Hey.

You okay?

Carl confessed.

Carl confessed?

He pushed this note under my door.

Rocky.

Rocky, you in there?

Open up.

Whoa, awful jumpy for a cop,
aren't you Sheriff?

Dammit, Rocky.

Almost got yourself shot.


(phone ringing)

Hold on.

Hi, hon, it's me.

Yeah, Vincent just brought me
a confession note,

signed by Carl.

How'd you get a confession?

Slid under his door.

All right, just keep him there.

I'll be there in 10 minutes.

I will.
All right, bye.

He wants you to
stick around for a minute

since you found
the confession, all right?

Sure.
Yeah.

Hey, why don't you just sit here

and I'll make us some coffee?

Can I use your bathroom?

Sure.

Goddammit, Rocky.

You mean to tell me this
didn't strike you as funny?

There's an industrial drum of cycle oil,

a bundle of shop towels,

an eight ounce bottle of chloroform,

hydrochloric acid and AA batteries?

I guess everything
kind of strikes me funny.

Do you even sell chloroform here?

Special order.

Well I need
the security tapes from 3:30.

(ominous music)

It should be somewhere on this one.

Freeze that frame.

That's him.

Emma, you found anything yet?

Got your print match.

Oscar Dillasaw.

Former resident of Liberty
who sliced his parents,

did 10 on a manslaughter
plea as a juvenile.

You scared me.

(siren wailing)

You just stay out of here!

(ominous music)


(ominous music)

You got that coffee?

Shit!

Marge!

Marge!

Marge!


Baby?

Amy Jones.

Amy Jones.

Hang on, baby, hang on.

Hang on, baby.

Baby?

Come on.

(ominous music)

Hello?

Amy?

I'm gonna kill you!

Bastard!

Oscar, why are you doing this?

You tell me.

You're sick.

I thought they locked you away?

I patiently did my time.

Why are you killing all these people?

To protect you!

From what?

Yourself!

Do you know what they do to
men that fuck middle girls?

They put them away.

I killed anyone that could destroy you.

I'm gonna kill you.

I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!


Freeze, drop the knife.

I had to kill him.

It's all over.

He killed your wife.

Drop the knife.

He's behind you!

* You didn't wake up
before you hit the ground *

* And I didn't stay up long enough *

* To see you falling *

* You never asked for
the world but then *

* You jumped from the rooftop *

* 'Cause you had to
have the last laugh *

* Look where you are *

* Look where you are now *

* Look where you are *

* I heard you say *

* Every day above ground
was a good one *

* You never see her *

* Hair in braids and blue eyes *

* 'Cause we didn't try hard enough *

* She's still waiting to hear you sing *

* A song for her *

* You jumped from the rooftop *

* She still asks me *

* Where are you now *

* Where are you now *

* Where are you now *

* I heard you say *

* Every day above ground *

* Every day above ground
was a good one *

* When you fall back down *

* And you lost your crown *

* Get back up, walk around *

* Turn that frown upside down *

* Take my hand once again *

* We will all understand *

* Help you find a new plan *

* It's time to help you *

* Get you back on your feet *

* And on your way *

* If the tables were turned around *

* I know you'd be there for me *

* It all works out *

* Don't get lost and forget *

* Turn the lights off and rest *

* Don't you worry no more *

* Kill your pain and sores *

* We'll be there when you wake *

* No more sweat or the shakes *

* Feel the love if you can *

* Lost your mind, feel insane *

* You're feeling hopeless *

* And all your dreams have gone away *

* Take the time *

* To heal your sorrows *

* Disappear from the world *

* Live for tomorrow *

* Hope you changed your ways *

* There's not much more to say *

* When the dark turns to gray *

* Broken hearts fade away *

* La da da, da, da *

* La da da, da, da *

* La da da, da, da *

* La da da, da, da *

* It's time to help you *

* Get you back on your feet *

* And on your way *

* If the tables were turned around *

* I know you'd be there for me *

* It all works out *

* And I hope *

* That it all works out *

* And I hope *

* That it all works out *

* And I hope that it all *

* That it all works out *

* That it all works out *

* That it all works out *

* That it all works out *
