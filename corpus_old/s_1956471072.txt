My name is Soyan
Schwartz, and I am

an Internet Activist.

I have infiltrated the
IT systems of numerous

government agencies
and corporations.

Over the years I have sought out

to expose classified
information.

Today I found
something that requires

immediate disclosure.

Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

our history and alter
the truth, the truth,

the truth, the truth....

Well it looks like
another wet one, folks.

Get your umbrellas
and your booties

if you're going out.

Possible thunderstorms...

Three suspects now
wanted in the murder of

the Victoria girl found
last week in the river.

Though their website
has not gone offline

since last month's
attack, Angela King warned

of future reprisals
of the security firm

pursued independently.

Stock Market went
through the roof today.

No one seems to have
predicted this, so it's hard

to know where it's heading.

Noji shares plunged
after a cyber attack

shut down several networks in

Southeast Asia
yesterday afternoon.

No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack,

but sources indicate the
virus may have originated

from servers in China.

And in politics
today, the election

is proving to be a close race.

Now I don't mean to
sound cynical, but...

...were arrested
on suspicion of

the denial of the
service attack.

The hacking organization
Independent Leak,

denies any involvement.

...laughter makes you smile.

Well, guess what.

It also raises the
levels of chemicals...

The UN and the Arab
League have declared

an Embargo against
the impressive regime.

Light and heavy arms continue
to flow into the region.

Traffic is backed up,
there's an accident

on the freeway that
hasn't been cleared yet.

And everyone is
stopping to look.

Internet Activist Angela
King is still at large,

though Interpol has
traced her movements

to South America.

Thanks for the news.

We've got a lot of great
music coming up for you

in just a few minutes.

(fast-paced music)

Here he is.

Over here, sit down.

I'm Lena Lebovitz.

This is my partner,
Russel Beleon.

Our lawyer, Clift Brown.

We asked you in here
today, because recently

something very serious
happened at our company.

Most of our clients
sign on for our services

online, it's about 200 a day.

So you can imagine our
surprise Friday morning when

our server crashed
after millions

of new users registered.

We know it was a hack.

We lost a few big clients,
that's what happened.

All because a few kids
wanted to have some fun.

Good thing is, when
someone hacks a system,

there's always the
possibility of getting caught.

And you know how DA's
like to make an example

out of some stupid kid.

Especially if they
connect the bust

to National Security issues.

We did find a few IP
addresses and traced them.

Hopefully that's how
we'll get our guy.

We know.

Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

We represent a lot of
high profile clients here.

They rely on us to
create new identities,

change facts, rewrite
history, so to speak.

How would you like
to go to work for us?

You already know our system.

Great, I'll take that as a yes.

The arms trafficking
ring has been tied

to a consortium of
front companies,

owned by businessman
and entrepreneur,

Haans Vanderbilt.

A number of unarmed
civilians were made

to lay down on the road outside.

This is what followed.

(sounds of gunfire)

After issuing a comprehensive
report on violations

of the Embargo, Human
Search founder Alice Carson

may finally have
her day in court.

ICC judges rule
on Monday whether

the case may proceed.

(phone vibrating)

Here are a few
photos of the victims.

You can match them, online
photographs and videos,

through what you call
facial recognition software?

We will then make
positive IDs and create

a master list of addresses and

group them into families.

How many people are there?

This will take weeks.

Here's a file with
names and addresses,

we don't have everything.

That's why I need you.

Who else has access to this?

No one, just you and me.

Why, is something wrong?

How do we make any
money with this?

I still have a
donor or two left,

but I'm takin' a lot of heat.

From who?

From people who know how to

pick the locks on my office.

(slow rock music)

Sorry.

I was setting up the
code for the firewall.

OK, shall we?

This is Teco, Fortune 500.

The CEO John Chester just
died at the age of 87,

his son James is set
to inherit his job.

His wife is the problem.

We discovered that in the
90's she made a number of

soft core films under
the name, Bella Blue.

Jump to 2000, fell
completely off the grid.

Got plastic surgery and
became Mrs. James Chester.

Does the husband know?

No, not fully.

Now they have three
children, host political

fundraisers and
sit on the board of

several major charities.

So, who wants us to
clean up their past?

Teco, the Board of Directors
is naturally concerned.

Let's see.

She's still got some fan pages.

Is that her?


Yes, that's her.

We're gonna need a good
back story for this one.

Let's kill her off.

What do you mean, kill her off?

Start a rumor online,
Bella Blue died

in a car crash,
suicide, whatever.

Plant some articles,
fabricate some photos,

and build a paper trail
for Mrs. Chester Jr.

What about everything in print?

The newspaper'll
pick it up and put it

on their website.

It'll go 'round and
'round from there.

OK, let's do it,
pull the trigger.

The company has booked
you a hotel suite

so you can work at your leisure.

I'll be by later
to check on things.

You have two weeks.

Good luck.

Kid does have imagination.

We'll see how he
swims with bigger fish.

Clift, you ready?

(rock music)

(distant sirens)

(water running)

A number of unarmed
civilians were made

to lay down on the road outside.

This is what followed.

(gunfire and screams)

Arms dealer Vanderbilt
was arrested then released

after only a few hours.

He has been identified by the

International Criminal Court
as a person of interest

in violating the Embargo.

Over the last 20 years,
Vanderbilt has built

one of the most powerful
arms fortunes in Europe,

and also may be responsible
for countless deaths

through illegal
weapons trafficking.

Yeah, I heard the news.

Let's talk tomorrow.

(hitting punching bag)

I haven't finished.

He paid the bond and vanished.

Even if we kept our last
donor, I'd still lose the case.

They're too strong.

Don't worry you
can pay me later.

Loise, you don't understand.

No I don't.

(phone rings)

I'll call you, OK?

Yes.

I've been wanting to speak
with you for some time.

Well, I'd rather
meet you in person.

I'll text you the address
and I'll see ya then.

Yes, OK.

Hey, come on in.

You got your laptop with ya?

I wanna show you something.

I had a conference call with

some arms dealers yesterday.

They sold their products
to the wrong side,

there was an Embargo,
now they're in trouble.

Those are the clients,
there's the front company.

there's the main company.

And this one here,
she's the liar.

She filed a complaint with

the International
Criminal Court.

I tried to sideline her,
but she is stubborn.

Anyway, I arranged a
meeting with her for

a job interview tomorrow.

Going to throw her
off trail very gently.

What do you want me to do?

Make up something good.

Tell them they were
there to hand out

food, medicine, the
usual, and we need to

erase that bank transfer
from the Cayman Islands.

I don't know how the hell
she figured that out,

but I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

Pull over here, please.

You think you can handle this?

Good.

Just make 'em look
like the good guys.

I'll be back in a few minutes.

And there was another
drive by shooting

today downtown, it
appears to be...

Vanderbilt's
representatives stated that

the wholesaler sold
Ammonium nitrate solely

for agricultural purposes.

They declined to comment
on its use in a recent

bombing of the Embassy.

Vanderbilt's charity raised
over 100 million dollars

in its efforts to
combat the spread

of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa.

...been appointed CEO of Teco,

North America's largest
food processing conserve.

Chester will be granted
two million shares of...

Hey.

What are you doing
here all the time?

Near a cell.

Need a good wireless reception.

You work in high tech?

Not really.

I'm more interested in history.

What kinda history?

I don't know, people?

I'm more interested
in technology.

You're a game tester?

I'm a player.

Look.

ICMP protocol 873DFS3.

Key log the pass code
from the database Cash.

Bypass the honey pot.

Check for Admins.

Done, I'm in.

Inside of what?

Bank of Kilnay.

What should I do?

I don't know, hack a real bank.

We Bonnie and Clyde?

We're not.

You know why a computer's
so easy to hack?

They were never designed
for the Internet.

It's their ultimate weakness.

I don't think people are
made for the Internet either.

Personally, I don't
trust computers.

But you have one.

Yeah, what choice do you have?

What do you choose?

No viruses, no batteries.

Never crashes, very reliable.

I could store a thousand
of those on my keydrive.

Yeah, you're just
out of this world.

I didn't mean to upset you.

Where are you going?

(knock at the door)

Russel sent me over to
see how you settled in.

And I brought the
files you requested.

You know, I was against
hiring you at first.

But now I'm just as
impressed as Russel is.

Do you mind?

I can't stand those heels.

Would you?

You don't have much
experience with women, do you.

It's OK.

Lean back.

It's OK.

Ya know,

I've been wondering
what turns you on.

Cyber sex?

Double jab to the
body, a couple short.

Oh, but that uppercut,
it lands hard

to the side of the face.

Our challenger is
reeling, he's trying

to find his footing.

Oh, their tied up in
the center of the ring.

Now there, there's a jab,
there's a combination.

A left and then the
right, oh and there's

a hard uppercut,
hard to the jaw.

Our challenger is reeling.

Then he comes back
with a counter punch.

It's going left, to the right,
a hard one to the temple.

Oh, that's gotta hurt, folks.

We are getting our money's
worth, this fight is

going down to the wire.


Hey sis.

How've you been?

Fine, are you OK?

Just dealin' with my new flat.

Still in New York?

Well, you know, it's been hard.

You need money?

I wanna see you.

Why don't you ever call me?

I'll call you if
anything comes up, OK?

Oh, they're tied up in
the center of the ring.

(fast-paced music)

Do you normally have
meetings at your house?

Normally, no, but
when it's confidential.

So let's get to it.

You said we both have some

valuable information to share?

Did I say that?

Well you called me 10 times,

so I'd like to know.

OK, fair enough.

I'm a head hunter, and
I'm looking to recruit

some one for our
high tech company.

I don't work in
the high tech field.

Do you know anything
about hackers?

Anything about criminal
investigations?

I do know about criminals,
but only in relations

to Human Rights.

That's why I
noticed your profile.

Do you know why Babylon fell?

Too much information.

Too many languages.

A breakdown of communications,

and that's where we are today.

What we don't need
is another Babylon.

That's why I think
it's important to apply

International Human Rights
Standards to the Internet.

Seriously, I'm in bad shape.

I guess I came at
the right time then.

Tell me, how much would
you like to earn per year?

What do you mean?

I mean, give me a number
if your dreams came true.

If my dreams came true.

Sorry, I missed my bus.

You like the water, do
you wanna take a dip?

I don't know how to swim.

A computer hacker
that doesn't drive

and doesn't swim,
true modern man.

Come on, your parents
never taught you

how to swim?

I never had parents.

Do you have any
relatives at all?

Well look at the advantages,
you're a free man.

No roots, you can do
whatever the hell you like.

What about you,
you got any family?

I do whatever the
hell I like as well.

I wanna ask you something,
have you heard about

this hacking group
Independent Leak?

What you know about 'em?

I know they're tough,
radical, they hack into

corporations,
banks, governments.

That means us too.

They intend on
releasing millions of

classified emails that
we don't want going out.

We've gotta do whatever
it takes to stop them.

I'll look into it.

I've got a name for ya.

Angela King, apparently
the ring leader.

We don't have much
information on her.

No fixed address.

Always on the move.

Sometimes we spot her
name on flight manifests,

but always a little too late.

Maybe she works
for the Chinese.

No, no she's a freelancer.

How's our Firewall?

It's safe... now.

Good.

Because we can't
take any chances.

Let's go inside, I wanna
give you somethin'.

You've got no excuse
to be late now.

We're both on company time.

Thank you.

How you gettin' home?

I'll just catch the bus.

Here, take my car
that's in the drive.

Let's just say, it's an
advance for this next job.

(car engine starts)

Hey, the door was open.

My door is always open.

I brought your stuff back.

Look at you!

Which is, oh, Life Against
Death, Norman O'Brown.

One of Jim Morrison's favorites.

Nice to see how this
place never changes.

I haven't read this one, may I?

Uh huh.

Coffee?

You look worried,
what's going on?

Still no news about him?

No.

It's over.

You know that's not the
case, it's part of you.

And there's always a
chance for good news.

I don't know.

So, how 'bout you?

I'm putting finishing
touches on my book

about this hedge fund that
dabbled in the drug trade.

I'm gonna call it Powder
Brokers, or Wall of Powder,

I don't know, I
haven't decided yet.

Sounds like Pulitzer material.

Oh, I'm not gettin' that.

You're my only friend.

Why don't you take a break?

Get out outta town?

(phone vibrating)

I'll think about it, gotta run.

(commentating a boxing match)

(door opens)

(commentating a boxing match)

You texted me your
address, so I assumed

it was an invitation.

Wait.

(commentating a boxing match)

You don't drink?

I've never really met
a girl like you before.

Why are you telling me this?

I don't know,
you seem friendly.

Don't try to label this.

I'm not.

I like your company, but my
text wasn't a proposition.

Sure.

So you box?

Yeah, wanna try?

No, I'm sure you're
too strong for me.

Do you play any video games?

Not anymore, that's kid stuff.

I'm playing all the time.

I created a game that
combines virtual reality,

telepathy, and the real world.

I'll show you.

Basically in any
room I can create

a chess board, 64 squares.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,

one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

Now match all the
objects up as if the game

is already in motion.

So, the coffee maker could
be one of your knights.

And those glasses over
there could be your pawns.

Even your eye can
become a piece,

rooks, bishops...

...king, queen.

You follow me?

Not really.

Close your eyes.

All right, let's begin,
simply with a pawn.

I'd do E2, E4.

Now your turn.

Try N, G, A, F, six.

Follow me?

OK, this is my knight.

I'm gonna move it towards you.

I do N, G, A, F, six.

No, no, no, no, don't do that.

But I didn't do anything.

It's telepathy, between
you and me, you feel it?

Trust it, it's all there,
just let me guide you.

Take my pawn, and I
move my pawn, D2, D3.

Now.

N, A4, C5.

Hey, how'd you do that?

Concentrate.

All right, I do Q, D1, E2.

What do you do?

Q, seven, E.

Yes!

(conversation muffled by music)

OK, I can't focus anymore.

That's fine, you
really know how

to visualize the game!

Yeah, it's like
with permutations

or identifying the password.

Each move has a limited
number of combinations.

I get that.

I'm impressed.

Don't be.

Do you mind if I crash here?

(suspenseful music)

(heavy breathing)

I had a dream last night.

Really.

Yeah, you were in it.

No kidding.

I gotta go.

When can I see you again?

Thanks for-

-Thank you for what?

So how often do
they see each other?

I don't know.

I thought you kept tabs on him.

I do.

The kid is young and naive.

We took a huge risk with him.

So, what about this girl?

She's young too.

I think she's a nobody,
but here's something

you're not gonna like,
apparently she was working for

my new lawyer friend.

Really.

I told ya you
weren't gonna like it.

And you think it's
just a coincidence that

they happen to work
for each other?

Maybe she's spying on us.

I doubt it, Lena.

Listen, I'll figure it out.

I'll contain the problem,
don't worry about it.

So what did your new
lawyer friend say about her?

She said that the girl
wasn't a problem, but I had to

dig a little deeper.

And?

And I fucked her.

You fucked the lawyer?

Yes, I fucked the lawyer.

It's just business, Lena.

Are you proud of
yourself, Russ?

I think she's in love with me.

There's nothing I
can do about it.

She wanted a job.

Maybe.

You know, you
believe in yourself

a little bit too much, Russ.

And what's worse, you
believe your own lies.

I guess that's how you made it.

(jet engine)

Listen, we're working on it.

You're workin' on who.

Angela King.

None of us want
those email released.

The kid found out
some information,

she's on a flight next week.

Take care of it.

Good.

(knock on the door)

Hey.

I need a drink.

How would you play your
game in this hotel suite?

A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

I thought you
weren't interested.

I can win.

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

Whites or blacks, you choose.

This one.

You start.

E2, E4.

C7, C5.

N, G1, F3.

Hold on, let me
show you something.

What's that?

Just put it on.

What is that?

One, two, three.

You see something?

It's beautiful!

It's a virtual reality program.

Here, go like that,
haven't actually done this

with two pairs of
glasses before.

OK, same thing, concentrate.

You with me?

Yeah.

N, B8, C6.

N, B1, C3.

N, G8, F6.

Q, D4, D8.

Where's the king?

K, E7, E6.

E3, E2.

B, F1, B5, as ordered my queen.

Checkmate.

Indeed.

I think you lost intentionally.

Oh yeah?

What are we doing.

Listen, we're working on it.

You're working on who?

Angela King.

None of us want those
emails released.

The kid found out
some information,

she's on a flight next week.

(noise of an airplane crashing)

In just a second, it was
completely hidden in a

cloud of a combination
of smoke and dust.

The circumstances of
the crash have attracted

additional scrutiny, ever
since Internet Activist

Angela King was identified
as one of the passengers.

Talked to Washington
this morning.

Someone got Angela King.

You know who got her?

Makes no difference,
she's out of the picture.

Gotta be careful what's next.

We have to anticipate
the other guy's move,

kinda like a chess game.

You play?

No.

Well, ya should.

Business, politics, life,
it's all like chess.

You have to always
be two steps ahead.

She is perfect
for a screensaver.

Have you had any dreams lately?

No, just that one time
I crashed at your place.

You see that little
star over there?

On that star are all
the people I love.

Did you see this
one, it's moving.

Yeah a satellite or plane.

Do you think we're a
part of this universe?

Not at all.

(fast-paced rock music)

Who is that?

Nothing.

Who is he?

You're jealous?

No.

It's my brother.

He vanished a long time ago.

What happened?

I was at a fair with my
sister and my brother.

Remember those
video game arcades?

I could spend hours
on those machines.

Sometimes my brother
would wander the arcade

while I played, as kids do.

How old would he be today?

20-something.

Suppose you've already checked

the juvenile records database.

It's gotta be in
there someplace.

What's his name?

Jeremy.

Here's the website.

I can actually search for
you later, if you want.

I have to go.

A number of unarmed
civilians were made

to lay down on the road outside.

This is what followed.

(screaming and gunfire)

(picture-taking noises)

You shouldn't
worry about Loise.

Well I am concerned.

She's getting to him,
I'm losin' the boy.

Take her out of this, not her.

I don't get it.

You know her, she
used to work for you.

I mean, it's a little
close for comfort.

What the fuck is
going on, are you her

guardian angel or what?

I'll take care of Loise,
don't worry 'bout her.

That still leaves me
with a bigger issue,

what to do with him.

You'll take care of him,
he's your protege, not mine.

What's happening, you vanished.

How did my files end
up on your computer?

What are you talking about?

My files ass hole!

I don't know what
you're talking about!

(knife falls to ground)

Who are you?

Who the fuck are you!

You wouldn't believe
me, even if I told you.

I'm sorry.

Get the fuck out of here.

My name is Soyan Schwartz,

and I am an Internet Activist.

I have infiltrated the
IT systems of numerous

government agencies
and corporations.

Over the years, I have
sought out to expose

classified information.

Today I found
something that requires

immediate disclosure.

Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

our history and alter the truth.

As Mau, Lennon, and
others used propaganda for

political purposes,
corporations now control...

(knock on the door)

(another knock on the door)

What's going on in here?

There are three ways to
escape a bad situation.

You can attack your enemy
and fight back, you can

defend yourself and limit
the damages, or you can

just kill yourself and
exit the game entirely.

What are you doing?

You're a sweet boy.

Intelligent, even brilliant.

But so naive.

Who sent ya here, Russel?

That girlfriend
of yours, Loise,

has been hacking your computer.

How do you know that?

We have sources.

Who are you spying
on, her or me?

I'm just trying to save
that nice ass of yours.

You've been played.

She doesn't want you,
she wants your files.

I don't believe it.

Well you better believe
it, because that is the

only story that's gonna fly
with Russel and his clients.

We still have a lot
of work to do, OK?

Stay away from her.

You've been warned.

(door shuts)

(symphonic music)

Loise, Loise, Loise, answer me!

(vomiting noises)

What are you doing here?

It's OK, it's OK, I'm
gonna get us outta here, OK?

Go away!

You're gonna be OK.

Where are we?

Who are you?

I don't know.

Some time ago, I bonded
with the other hackers.

I started an organization
called Independent Leak.

We hit banks, corporations,
police databases,

insurance companies,
everything we could.

Started as a game,
before it got big.

We have millions of
emails and databases

with secrets people
have to know.

About what?

Classified information.

Independent Leak was founded

by a woman, Angela King.

She was killed, right?

She was attracting
too much attention.

Where did you
leave those emails?

I have them.

I have a copy at the hotel,

and a backup somewhere
else, hidden.

I'm gonna release those emails.

I wanna get outta here.

I'm with you.

There's so much more
I wanna tell you.

(mellow music)

See you on the rooftop, 9 p.m.

Look, you think I've
done something wrong, OK.

I may have crossed the line,

I never gave up on the case.

It's too late.

I gave you information
that put you at risk.

See, I erased everything,
no more files, we're all set.

I feel responsible for you.

So if you're planning anything,
you should tell me about it.

It's none of your
business anymore.

It is my business, there
are people after Soyan.

And after you too.

What do you mean?

I know who they
are, and I know what

they're capable of, I
continue the investigation.

I saw pictures,
addresses, and files.

I saw surveillance video
of you and Soyan together.

I thought you should know.

That's why I'm here.

Don't worry about me, I'm off.

(distant sirens)

(beeping of ATM buttons)

(busy signal)

(computer beeping)

(helicopter flying overhead)

How did you get in?

I pay for this room
and the room next door.

Did you forget?

You're my guest here.

(phone beep)

So, Angela King.

(phone vibrating)

Soyan?

Like the king in a chess game.

And Angela, like
an angel unseen.

I can't hear you.

Create your own avatar,
book hotel rooms and flights

in her name and keep
us chasing someone who

doesn't even exist.

That was clever.

Very clever, indeed.

I underestimated you.

Then, just as we were
about to close in,

you kill her off, online,
just like you did Bella Blue.

How'd you find out it was me?

We're on company time.

How much did they pay you

to stop Independent Leak?

How much information
do you have on us?

Enough, enough to show how you

manipulated the media.

So you left your IP
address intentionally.

That was a red herring.

Big companies often
hire their hackers.

So you come in
like a Trojan horse.

Makes me wonder, how
many more like you

are gonna come out of the
belly of that wooden steed.

More like an army.

Small rooms, Internet cafes,

anywhere there's a
wireless connection.

We're faceless.

But we have eyes, and
we see everything.

You're gonna lose your queen.

I don't think so.

Checkmate.

(slow-paced music)

It goes something like this.

Promising young employee
of high tech company

found dead in hotel
room by heart attack.

It's got a nice ring
to it, don't you think?

And when the authorities
contact me, I'll tell them

how shocking it is.

Why, I just visited
him the night before.

He seemed fine, and in
a short time, a very

short time, it won't matter
because you'll be forgotten.

Like everyone else.

D4, D8.

(Loise crying)

(noise in the distance)

(noise in the distance)


Where is he?

Cleaning!

Where is he?

Excuse me?

Did you see a young guy
who was staying here?

He passed away.

Heart attack, they said.

They pick up the body.

(rock music)

OK, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

One, two, three, four, five.

E4, D8


Where is it, fuck!

Where is it.

(techno music)

(typing on a laptop)

The Commission is set
to investigate the event

that took place here.

It was a long day with
the relatives of hundreds

of other, apparently
unarmed civilians,

who were killed, still
waiting for an official

explanation for their deaths.

We need to disguise
the IP address

before we upload it.

Can you do that?

Go ahead.

Today the activist
organization Independent Link,

released millions of emails

from BL Reputation
Management, a secretive

high tech company.

Though it will take a
long time to fully assess

it's impact, the
data dump has already

shaken financial markets
and turned Congressional

elections upside down.

A Senate investigation is likely

to be announced later today.

This is it Russel,
I can't cover this.

In a surprising turn of
events, the ICC has recharged

Vanderbilt with
violating the Embargo.

The suspect is currently
in custody, awaiting trial

based on evidence
supplied by Alice Carson,

the founder of Human Search.

Two days ago, Soyan
Schwartz, the leader of

the Independent Leak,
was found dead in his

hotel room after an
apparent heart attack.

However, a secret video
recording now reveals that

Mr. Schwartz may have been
murdered in an attempt

to prevent his release
of the classified emails.

Today many companies
are trying to rewrite

our history and alter the
truth, as Mau, Lennon,

and others use propaganda
for political goals.

Corporations now control images

for commercial purposes.

We are on the verge of
a new world, in which

objective facts can be
altered in the name of

public relations,
by companies who are

larger than states.

The media is the most
powerful entity in the world.

They have the power to
make the guilty innocent

and the innocent
guilty, and that's power

because they control
the minds of the masses.

Those are the
words of Malcolm X.

This is Soyan Schwartz, and
I wish you all good luck.

Loise, who'll take charge
of Independent Leak now?

(soothing music)

I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

I don't know what to say.

You sure you don't
wanna come with me?

No, I'd be too nervous.

I don't wanna scare him.

You go.

OK, I'll call you.

Loise, I knew you'd never
give up on me and Jeremy.

We're a family.

We're a family again.

(soothing music)

This is her, this is you...

...and this is us, all together.

I'll come back with
Eileen next time.

Who helped you track
me down on the Internet?

Soyan, a friend, a
dear friend of mine.

(slow soothing music)
