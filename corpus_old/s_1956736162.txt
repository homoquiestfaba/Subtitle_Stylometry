Are you sure?

<i>Â¡PapÃ¡!</i>

Dad, are you okay?

You didn't
answer the phone.

Or the door.

Dad, it's here.
It's here.

Remember?

The button that opens the door.
Mm.

Everything is open.

Mm.

Well, not actually, Dad.

Front door was closed.

I see.

[woman] <i>Leo.</i>
[moans]

Leo.

Leo.




[phone buzzes]

[vacuum cleaner starts]

Hey, listen.

I can't make it in
this morning.

Yeah, something came up.
I'll be in later, though. I just...

Yeah, I have to, um...

Well, I'm taking my dad
to the dentist

and getting
his eyes tested.

No, no. I'll be back
by lunchtime, though.

For sure.

I'll be there.

[vacuum cleaner stops]

Hello, Mr. Leo.

You awake now?

Are you with us?
Who...

You're...

I'm Xenia.

And you're Leo.

Mr. Leo.

[Leo groans]

[Xenia] You want water?
Mmm.


[in Spanish]

He keeps looking
at something.

Do you wanna look
at that photo?

Of NÃ©stor?

Look at NÃ©stor.

He was such a good dog,
wasn't he?

Don't you remember?

No?


[in Spanish]


<i>M-Mi amor...</i> [sighs]

No... [groaning]


<i>Ay, Dolores.</i>

Dolores?

Who's that?

Is that someone
you used to know?

Today. <i>Juntos.</i>

Together?

That's right, Dad.
That's what we're going to do today.

We're going to
the dentist together.

You remember?

Maybe?

[moans softly]

<i>Ay, ya.</i>

[door slams]
Dolores.

Huh? Dolores!


You are hot, Mr. Leo.

It's stifling in here.

They still haven't
fixed the boiler.

I'll open a window.

Mmm.

This is early for you.

Not working this morning, huh?
[laughs]

A writer is always working,
my friend, in here.

[water running]

Okay.
No. Mm-mmm.

You don't want to?
No.

Okay. Sorry, Mr. Leo.
I'm sorry.

You don't have to
if you don't want.

Uh, dressing.
Uh, your clothes.

I can help.

I can...

Yeah?

Okay, good.

Good.

[traffic noise]

Dad.

[car horn honks]
No, no.

Dad!

We have to go.
Come on.


[car horns honking]
[sirens wailing]

Dad?

Let's go.

[siren wailing]
[truck horn blaring]

[groaning]
Dad?

Come on.


You have to get in.
Come on. It's okay.

I'm going to
close the door, yeah?


Ah.


[siren wailing]

[car horn blaring]
[gasps]

I see. I see.

[muttering]
Yes, Dad?

[groaning]
Dad?

Do you wanna tell me something?
[groans] Many things.

Things, uh...

All... [groans]

No, no.

There. [sighs]

[exhales, sighs]

Me.

Things.

[car horn honks]
[grunts, sighs]

It's okay.
[grunts]

Mm.

Are you ready
for the dentist?


Ahh.
Mm?

You gonna open your mouth?
Ahh.

Ahh.

[both laughing]

Oh, Dad.



[waves lapping]

[car door opens]

[woman] Thank you. Bye.
[car door shuts]

[women chattering,
laughing]

[chattering,
laughing continues]

[chattering in German]

Hello?

Can I help you?

Mikael? Mikael!

You have new customers.

And give me a cigarette,
please.

Your mouth.

Can you just bring
that hand down?

Good.
And just open your mouth.

Open.

Can you open your mouth,
please?

Good.

[air hissing]

Uh-huh.
[grunts]

[groans]
If you could sit in the chair a little bit longer.

<i>Tranquilo, papÃ¡.
Tranquilo.</i>

It's okay.


Sit back. Good, good.
There you go.

A little longer.

Good.

Okay. And this one might have
to come out eventually, okay?

Do-Don't worry.

[groans]
Not right now.

It doesn't have to come out right now.
No.

Nothing's gonna happen right now. Do
you understand? This is just a check-up.

Does he understand?
Sorry?

I'm asking,
does he understand English?

Of course he does.
He's lived here for over 30 years.

Okay.

Would you like to
rinse your mouth out?

Mm, water.
Huh?


No, no, no. Don't drink it.
Don't drink...

No, no, no, no.


[groans, sighs]

[urine trickling]

Oh.

Water.



[women laughing]

[clears throat]

[laughing continues]

Hmm.

[murmuring] No. No.
Dad? Dad?

Dad, we have to do this, okay?
We have to change your pants.

No, no.

[grunts]
[sighs]

No.
Are you shy? You're a little shy?

Look, my eyes are closed.

Not seeing you.
Not seeing you.

Not seeing you.

Whoa!
Oh, whoa!

That's why we're going
to get your eyes tested.

Not seeing me? Ha!

Come on.

Ah-ah. Stand up.
Stand up.

Yeah.


No. No.
Oh, Dad.

It's normal. It's normal
to take off your pants.

See?
People do it all the time.

Look.

Whoo! See?

It's normal.
It's normal, Dad.

See? Whoop. Whoo!
[mumbling, chuckling]

Ha! I think
they'd fit you real nice.

Don't you think? Whoo!

Stylish, Dad!

[knocking]
Just a minute!

Ah! Oop! Okay.

Mmm.
Ooh!

Yuck, yuck.
Okay.

[speakers:
mariachi music playing]


[in Spanish]

Hmm?

[door slams]


[waves lapping]

Mmm.

Sorry. Can I ask you a question?

Okay.

What kind of endings
do you prefer?

In books.

I'm a writer, you see.

Depends on the story.
What happens in yours?

Since you've asked...

uh, in my story,
a man sets off...

on a long voyage

and overcomes
one obstacle after another

until he ends up
on an island.

Is it about you?

About me? No, no, no.

And on the last page,

he has to decide
to continue his life in exile

or to come back home,
to what was once his home.

And?
Uh...

he may discover that his family
has not waited for him.

How long has he been away?

At least...

20 years.

[woman 2] Twenty years?
Twenty years.

No chance.

But what if he regrets
his decision to leave?

Bit too late, isn't it?

Is it?
Is it too late?

We should go.
Come on.

Maybe see you later.
I doubt it.

[vehicle door closes]

[sighs]
[engine starts]

Dolores!

Mm.

[in Spanish]

Yes, Dad?

What
did you say?

[in Spanish]

No.

No.

Leo...
<i>Ya estuvo.</i>

Dad! No!
[car horns honking]

Dad! Dad!

Dad.

Does it hurt?

No.
Are you in pain?

No.

Look at me.

Look at me!

Do you want me to call an ambulance?
Yes. Please.

No.

You're hurt.

Uh... pa... pers?

You don't need papers.
You live here, Dad.

Yes.
You're a citizen.

You're legal.
No.

You're safe.

[engine idling]


[muttering in Spanish]

[buzzer buzzing rapidly]

[buzzing slows down]


Hi. Look, I may not make it in
by lunchtime after all.

Shit. Sorry.
Can I call you back?

Mm.
Sorry.

Dad?
[grunts]

So... do you know
where you are?

The...

Do you know why?

[louder] Do you know why you're in the hospital?
[mutters] No.

Do you know
what day it is?

Today?

Okay, he's fine,
I think.

Fine?
His head is fine. It's a superficial cut.

I wasn't referring
to his underlying condition.

The scan shows some further
atrophy in the frontal lobes.

Actually, I wanted to ask you
some questions about his symptoms.

Does...
[muttering]

[in Spanish]

<i>Mi mujer.</i>

<i>Mi mujer.</i>



<i>PapÃ¡?</i>

[in Spanish]

Did you wanna see Mom?

Is that what you were
trying to say before?

Because I can call her and tell her
that you're here if you want me to.

[in Spanish]

You're sorry?

[murmurs faintly]

Don't worry, <i>papÃ¡.</i>

We all have regrets.

I'm sure she has too.


[speakers:
mariachi music playing]

[mariachi music
continues playing]

[Leo] <i>Rita.</i>
[woman] <i>There. You see?</i>

He knows perfectly well
who I am.

The malingering bastard.

Do you know who this is?
But he just said...

Dolores.


Dolores.
Dolores. Our son...

[Rita] He always wanted sons, you see.
He did?



[chuckles]
It's not funny.

Maybe he should've
stayed with her.

Dolores is a real person?
[chuckles]

His first love.
Childhood sweethearts.

Very passionate.

He adored her, apparently.

A codependent disaster, in my
opinion, from the stories he told me.


My beautiful disaster.
<i>Hermoso.</i>

Does he often hallucinate?

Excuse me, but my father does have a
name, actually, and can hear you.

prefer to step outside to talk?

Mm?
[grunts]

If it's okay with you, sir, I'm just gonna
have a word outside with your family.

Two.

Two what?
Two words?

Two words
are okay with you?

Two of them.

Mm-hmm, yes.

[sirens wailing]
Two of them.


Yes, that's because
we're in the emergency room.

Emergency.

Mmm. Urgent care.
Urgent.

[women whooping,
laughing, chattering]

[speaking German]

Oh! No, no, no!
[both laughing]

<i>Wake up, Leo. Wake up, Leo.</i>

[Rita] Time to go home.
Home?

With you?
[Rita laughs]

No.

We divorced.

Quite a long time ago
now, actually.

Divorced?
Yes.

Probably because I became
more successful than you.

A lot more, actually,
which neither of us could deal with.

But we're still friends.

Friends?
Yes.

I think that's what
people call it.

You live in that dump
overlooking the tracks,

which you like,
apparently, alone.

Alone?

Yes, which for some reason
you prefer.

And your daughter feels
that we should respect that.

However, the doctor is,
as they say, concerned...

and thinks the time has come...
Mom!

[moans softly]


Your hair.
[scoffs]

Same as it ever was.
Mm-mmm.

[grunts]
Well, more or less.

Thanks to my colorist.

Looks good, huh?
No.

Oh, just...

just agree with me
for once.

Upon a time.

Oh, Christ.
You m-mine.

No, not anymo...

As I just mentioned,
I have a new husband now.

You've met him.

N-No.
Yes, of course you have.

Dozens of times.
Socially. Parties.

Parties?

Parties? Parties?

We are too busy
for parties today, Dad.

Don't... Don't humor him,
sweetheart.

Cunning bastard.

He just pretends he doesn't remember
things so he can make me feel guilty.

Mom, stop it.

I'm sorry, sweetheart.


I didn't even ask where you were
going when all this happened.

We went to the dentist,
and now... [sighs]

we're going to the optometrist,
if we ever get there.

Can you manage?

Do you want me to come too? I suppose
I could rearrange some things and...

NÃ©stor.

NÃ©stor is there?

No.
NÃ©stor?

No, NÃ©stor
is no longer with us.

He's in heaven.

No.

Doggy heaven.
No.

He was a very good dog.


NÃ©stor! [whines]

Is he getting agitated?

We can give him something
to calm him down.

Why does everyone continue
to refer to Dad as "he,"

as if he's not here?

Well, is he?

Oh, NÃ©stor.


[engine idling]

[truck departs]

[laughing, faint]

Hey. Hey!
Hey!

[laughing, chattering]

I'm sorry!

[chattering continues,
faint]

Hey, are you following us?

No. No, no, no.
I'm not following. No, no.

It's just that I saw you
up there and then I... I...

I can't stop thinking about
the conversation we had before.

Because it's incomplete,
like my book.



You okay?
Yes.

Let me help you up.
[Leo gasps]

Thank you.

Wow.

What is it? Are you hurt?

No, it's that...

you keep reminding me
of someone that I once knew.

Do I? Who's that, then?

Uh, well...

we met at college.

And we had a daughter.

Who, by now,
will be, uh...

How old are you?

Probably the same age as your
daughter, I should think. Am I right?


Yes.

Do you see her often, your daughter?
No.

No, I don't.
Why?

Well, I left
when she was a baby.

Uh...
Why?

Because I couldn't
concentrate on my work

because of the noise
and the crying and...

You know?

That's sad.

That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

For her, at least.
For me, too.

But you have to make sacrifices
when you are a writer.

Are you saying you sacrificed
your daughter... for a book?

[inhales, exhales]


Dad?

Are you okay?

Let's quickly find you some nice pants
before we get your eyes tested, okay?

Okay?

We'll get some for me too.

Luckily for us,
we got a later appointment.

But we have to be quick.
Okay?

Other one.

Other one.

Huh? What other one?

Mmm.

Like you.

See you later, maybe.

Okay, okay, okay.

[phone buzzing]

I'm sorry.
I meant to call back.

There have been
some complications in my day.

What happened
in the meeting?

They still want me to do it,
don't they?

I've been working on it forever.
I've done all the research.

Well, that's just today.
I mean, I <i>can</i> do it.

No, it's just been
a crazy day, but I...

Sorry. Could you hold on
for just a moment?

Sorry.

[grunts, sighs]

[inhales, exhales]

Dad?

[gasps, sighs]

Dad?

Please don't disappear
like that again.

Where did you get that dog?
<i>EncontrÃ© a NÃ©stor.</i>

NÃ©stor.

He stole my dog!

Him! He stole my dog!

The fucking Mexican
stole my dog!

Okay, what's going on?

He stole my dog.
[whimpering] NÃ©stor.

Get out of my country,
you fucking criminal.

Listen, I can explain.
This is my father. He's just confused.

Is the dog hers?
Yes.

Give the lady back the dog now.
Dad? Dad?

[in Spanish]

[English] You're dead. Dead!
[daughter] Okay, please... Hey!


Stop. Get off him.
You're hurting him. Please.

<i>Okay? This is my dad.</i>

He's just confused. He's really
not well at all. Can't you see?

NÃ©stor.

<i>Dad? Come on. Dad?</i>

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.
[moans]

It's okay.

[scanner beeping]

[waves lapping]

[woman] Hello!
[chattering, laughing]

[motor
accelerating]

[chattering, laughing]
Whoo-hoo!

[inhales, exhales]

It's just a light.
It's not gonna hurt you.

Ah!
No, no.

Look this way, please.
[Leo groans]

For God's sake.

Okay.

Now, put your chin
right here for me.

Right here.
[whimpers]

Chin right here. Right here.
There you go.

Come on. Almost.

Dad? Dad?
Just put your...

There you go. Forward.
That's it. That's it. Okay?

It's not that difficult.
[sighs]

Just... Th-There you go.
Don't move, don't move.

Okay, good.
Now, looking here.


Okay, good, good.
Nice, nice, nice.

One more thing to do here
now, and then we're done.

Now, look straight ahead for me.
Looking up at the screen.

Now, can you read
that for me?

No, look through here.
Looking...

Excuse me, ma'am,
but is he...

Is he what?

Is he all there?

[elevator bell dings]

Sorry, Dad.

Those security guards.
Brutal.

And that stupid optometrist
was so rude, so disrespectful,

I could've killed him.

Killed... N-NÃ©stor?

NÃ©stor?

No.

No. He was put to sleep, Dad.
He was sick, you know.

Kill the sick?

Kill sick people?

No. Of course not.

[elevator thumps,
stops, beeps]

Hi.

Yes.

Oh, okay.

Oh.

That's very disappointing.

Yeah, he's a good choice.
Of course. Um...

You know, I've been working
on it for much longer.

Oh, I couldn't
call back today, you see.

[inhales, trembling]

I'm really sorry about that.

No, no. No, I ge...
I understand.

Yeah.

I get it. Thank you.


Fuck!



Went to Greece today.

No.

Today we went to
the dentist. Okay?

Then to
a stupid optometrist

with a minor detour
to the emergency room.

Okay?
You hit your head.

Tunnel.
That was a scan.

You were with me all day.
Okay?

No.

Gone.

Alone.

[Leo groans]

You know something,
Dad?

I can't pretend anymore.

I just don't know
what you're saying.

I'm lost.

I'm completely lost.

And as it happens,
I lost a very big job today.

It was a big story.

I'm gonna have to make
some hard choices.

For both of us.

I'm sorry.

But there it is.



Where have you been
all day, Dad?

[waves lapping]

[siren wailing]

[train passing]

that Jesus is free!

Home.


You've been waiting.
I'm sorry, Xenia.


Someone looks tired.
It's my fault. We tried to do too much in one day.

You need to go.
Can I help you with anything?

It's okay. It's my job.

I guess I'll be off,
then.

Okay.

I'll see you soon, Dad.

Home. I want go home.

This is your home.

Here.



No.



[cries out]

Okay.

Okay.

Okay!

I'll stay.

I'll stay tonight.
[sobbing]


[latch clicks]

<i>PapÃ¡?</i>

Are you okay?

Fuck.

Aah!

No.


Fuck.

[techno music playing,
faint, growing louder]

[techno music playing,
distant]

[people laughing,
chattering]

[laughing, chattering continue]
[techno music continues playing]

[techno music reverberating]

[music fades]

I called the hospital
and called the police.

Well, I just don't know
what else to do.

I just feel so terrible,
like...

I should've been
watching him, you know.

I should've heard him go out.
He went out barefoot, Mom!

[mariachi music playing,
faint]

[murmuring melody]

[mariachi music
continues, fades]

Oh.

[wind chimes jingling]

[in Spanish]

[siren wailing]

[car horns blaring]

[train passing overhead]

[techno music playing,
faint]


[techno music fading]


[heartbeats continue]

[hammering]
[air wrench whirring]

where you are, is it?

[man 2]
You get used to it.

What's this?
I mean, look at his feet.

[mutters] Home.
[man] Yeah, dirty.

Your customer, not mine.
[man 2] Show some respect, Tazeem.

You okay, uncle?

You okay?

[hammering]
[air wrench whirring]

Warm water. Please.

[water running]

Feet.

For your feet.

He should be at home,
Rahim.

[in Punjabi]

[winces, sighs]


That's good, huh?

Address!
What is your address?

Name of street?

[Rahim, in Punjabi]

Where do you live?

[moans]
Do you know?

Water.

I think we should
call the police.

<i>This the guy?</i>

He been causing
a problem?

No problem.
No, sir, not at all.

I, um...
I think maybe he is lost.

Also maybe his mind.

[in Punjabi]

where he lives?

The officer wants to know
where you live, uncle.


Home.

Sir. Come on.

Come on.

Watch your head.

Go ahead.

[bell tolls]

[inhales, exhales]

[bell tolls]


[bell tolls]



Hey, Mom.
They found him.

I know. Thank God.

Yeah, I'm taking him home now.

Wherever I go,

there I am.

True.

But you...

you're not always there.

Also very true, Dad.

"Dad"?
Yes.

You're my dad.

<i>Mi papÃ¡.</i>

So I chose...

Rita.

Which led to me,
so I'm happy you chose her.

One road, other... roads

I could... I could have...

Could have what, <i>papÃ¡?</i>


Could have...

gone to Greece.

Mom told me you went to Greece
when I was a baby.

To some island, to write.

Mmm, write, write.

Many years. Many...

Well, not really. You...

She said when you got there,
you changed your mind.

You turned around
and came straight back.

For you.

Did you, <i>papÃ¡?</i>

For me?

F-For me.

Well...

thanks for doing that.

For all of us.

Even if Mom and you
did get divorced later.

Alone.

You have me, <i>papÃ¡.</i>

But I have to work.

And you know
how much I love my work.

I've been working on some
stories in honor of your story.

And I have to travel.

So I won't always be here.

M-M-MÃ©xico.

I was supposed to go
to the border, actually.

I... I crossed over.

Yesterday.

Does it feel like yesterday?

<i>Was</i> yesterday.

And...

I went... there.

There.

And many other places
I went.

Mm.

I'm sorry, <i>papÃ¡.</i>

I'm trying
to understand.

I'll try harder...

to see it
from your point of view,

to see what you see.

No.


In the sea I died.

Mmm.

No, no.
[stammers]


I was...

I was there. I was...

I was... there.

All the same time.

And then?

And then?

And then come home.

This one.

With you.

Welcome back,
Dad.


Molly.


Y-You said my name.

Oh, yes, that's me.

And...

you're you.

However far away you go...

and whatever they say,

you are always you.
