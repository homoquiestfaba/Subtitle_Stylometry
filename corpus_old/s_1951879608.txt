<i>And now, back to the one man
in America who really gets it.</i>

<i>Alrighty, welcome back.</i>

<i>I'm here with the lovely Debra
and her beau, Joel.</i>

<i>Now, let's slap on our swim trunks...</i>

<i>...and go for a dip in Lake Joel.</i>

What is going on?

<i>The little lady says
you have no direction, no passion.</i>

<i>The audience wants to hear your story.
I wanna hear your story.</i>

<i>Right now, I work at Gutters.
It's a bowling alley.</i>

<i>Bowling, all right.
I bowled a 280 last week.</i>

<i>College grad like you must be what,
manager?</i>

<i>No, actually, no.</i>

<i>I give out shoes, and then
when they come back, I spray them.</i>

<i>And then I put them in their cubbies.</i>

<i>See, this is what I'm talking about.</i>

<i>He, he has no joie de vivre.</i>

<i>He got passed up for a promotion
and he didn't say a thing.</i>

<i>It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.</i>

<i>Shoe...?</i>

<i>Listen, Eddie needed the job
more than I did.</i>

<i>Come on, Joel, a young buck like you
should have the world at his toes.</i>

<i>Now, I want you to think back for me.</i>

<i>When you were a kid,
did you ever think...</i>

<i>...that you would be handling
other people's rented shoes?</i>

No.

<i>Not exactly, no, no.</i>

<i>But work isn't everything.</i>

I'm happy.

I am.

<i>I've got the best friends in the world.</i>

<i>And I've got Debra.</i>

<i>You came here for one thing,
but I'm hearing another.</i>

<i>- Am I right, audience?
Yeah.</i>

<i>It sounds like Joel here wants to scurry
home instead of facing the truth.</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

<i>I think you're the one
that's crying out for help.</i>

<i>Yeah. Are you willing to see
the situation for what it is?</i>

<i>Because he ain't.
He's hiding in the shady knoll...</i>

<i>...you know, looking for unicorns,
hoping no one finds him.</i>

<i>The point is, this relationship
is nothing but a bunch of hooey.</i>

<i>Whoa, wait, wait up.
We came here for career advice.</i>

<i>Dagnabbit, Joel, put a cork in it.</i>

I know this is tough for you.

<i>But you know what you need to do,
don't you?</i>

<i>Joel...</i>

<i>...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.</i>

What?

<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

<i>No, no.</i>

<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

<i>- Isn't that great?
Yes!</i>

<i>Wait a minute.
What is going on?</i>

<i>You need to shape up,
is what's going on.</i>

<i>You got a long road ahead of you,
and I am happy to say...</i>

<i>...that you are not taking her
with you.</i>

<i>No, you're not.</i>

<i>Joel...</i>

<i>...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.</i>

<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

<i>Joel.</i>

<i>Joel.</i>

<i>- Joel.
Joel?</i>

<i>Joel. Joel. Joel...</i>

<i>Seriously, dude...</i>

<i>...you gotta snap out of it.
This is not healthy.</i>

<i>- Hi, Ben.
Hi, Joel.</i>

<i>- Where'd you come from?
I came from outside.</i>

Hi.

<i>For crying in the night,
have you stopped bathing?</i>

<i>You look like shit
and you smell like shit.</i>

<i>What's the point?</i>

<i>We all die dirty.</i>

<i>All right. Well, look, that may be,
but I had my last final today.</i>

<i>My bar exam is in four months.</i>

<i>Right now, it's all about getting you
out of this funk.</i>

<i>All right, home skillet?</i>

<i>Buddy, I love you.
You're my best friend.</i>

<i>I'm really sorry that Deb broke up
with you, that really sucks.</i>

<i>But look on the bright side, huh?</i>

<i>- I mean, it's not gonna get any worse.
I got fired last week.</i>

Fantastic.

<i>Mr. Wendell said I wasn't fit
to work in the bowling industry.</i>

<i>He called me an ass face.</i>

<i>Said my face looks like an ass.</i>

<i>Your face doesn't look like an ass.</i>

Much.

<i>From here on in,
there's nowhere to go but up.</i>

<i>- No.
Yes.</i>

<i>Up, up, up, there we go.
Come on, come on.</i>

<i>On your feet. On your feet.
Good God, you stink.</i>

<i>Come on now, just gonna bring you
on a little trip to the window here.</i>

<i>Yeah, huh?</i>

<i>Come on, Nosferatu.</i>

<i>Who's got an idea?
I've got a brilliant idea.</i>

<i>Let's go hop in your ride.
Take the top down, huh?</i>

<i>Don't answer it.</i>

<i>Hi, honey, it's your mother.</i>

<i>I thought you should know that your
father took Buck ets to the dog park.</i>

<i>Buckets.</i>

<i>Well, there was a very aggressive
pug mix there.</i>

<i>And your father thought they were
just humping, you know, lik e dogs do?</i>

<i>And well, he didn't mak e it.</i>

<i>Oh, Harold.</i>

<i>Buckets? My Buckets?</i>

<i>Okay, okay, Joel, focus, focus.</i>

Look.

<i>Look at me, okay?
I am not gonna bullshit you anymore.</i>

<i>Today is a really, really shitty day.</i>

<i>But things are gonna turn around.</i>

<i>I can smell it.</i>

Wyatt?

<i>Gentlemen.</i>

<i>How many times have I applied
to the Oscar Mayer Wiener internship?</i>

<i>- Eleven.
How many times...</i>

<i>...have I been rejected?
Twelve.</i>

<i>That's also correct,
I did call that one time.</i>

<i>Whatever. To answer the question
that you haven't asked yet...</i>

<i>...but I know you want to,
"Where has Wyatt been all week?"</i>

<i>Well, I'll tell you where he's been.</i>

<i>He's been in the process
of creating his own Wienerwagon...</i>

<i>...with every last penny in his pocket.</i>

That's right.

<i>Wyatt's Wienerwagon.</i>

<i>- Wyatt's?
Yes.</i>

<i>This is an authentic,
chrome- plated, winged wiener.</i>

<i>One of only 600,000 made.</i>

<i>Can I ask a stupid question?</i>

<i>Now, why have I spent every last penny
in my pocket...</i>

<i>...on this Wienerwagon
and 12,000 frozen hot dogs?</i>

<i>It's called taking action, bitches.
Okay?</i>

<i>I will distribute hot dogs
across these great Estados Unidos...</i>

<i>...and prove that I am wiener worthy.</i>

<i>You'll drive thousands of miles
on your own dime...</i>

<i>...to distribute wieners across these,
as you put it, great Estados Unidos...</i>

<i>...to advertise for a company that's
rejected you resoundingly 12 times.</i>

<i>Correctamundo.</i>

<i>It's a self-promotion blitzkrieg.</i>

<i>And it wouldn't be a road trip
without my two other angels.</i>

<i>Little walkie- talkie.</i>

<i>Come on, you can be Lucy Liu.</i>

<i>Me?</i>

<i>I think I'll go inside.</i>

<i>There's chips...</i>

<i>...under the La-Z-Boy.</i>

<i>Okay, bro, you go get suited up.
We blast off in 60.</i>

<i>Were you dropped as an infant?</i>

<i>Cameron Diaz would not say that
to Drew Barrymore.</i>

<i>I am not Cameron Diaz.
You are not Drew Barrymore.</i>

<i>Joel is not Lucy Liu.</i>

<i>At least not yet.
He's going through a lot of shit.</i>

<i>Are you completely clueless?</i>

<i>Well, here's a clue.</i>

<i>I've mapped out our entire trip...</i>

<i>...and the final stop on the tour
is Los Angeles.</i>

<i>When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>

<i>About opening up
the largest can of whoop ass...</i>

<i>...that's ever been crizzacked.
I got it.</i>

<i>So you wanna go kick
Dr. Dwayne's ass.</i>

<i>No, we're gonna hold him down while
Joel beats the bejesus out of him.</i>

<i>Until he cries for his mommy.</i>

His mama.

<i>You've lost it.</i>

<i>Drake Hanswald.</i>

<i>And the name.</i>

<i>Drake Hanswald.</i>

<i>You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche.</i>

<i>And you're about
to join the Smashed Face Club.</i>

<i>Will never pass our lips again.</i>

<i>- Dude, don't do it.
I did it.</i>

<i>No, no, no. No, we promised.
We made a pact.</i>

<i>- Why would you bring that up?
Why? I'll tell you why.</i>

<i>Because he never stood up
for himself back then.</i>

<i>Never stood up for himself at all.</i>

<i>With girls, his jobs, everything.</i>

<i>Dr. Dwayne pulled a Drake Hanswald
on Joel on national television.</i>

<i>But this time, he's fighting back
like his forefathers before him.</i>

<i>You know, Lex Luthor tried
to Drake Hanswald Superman.</i>

<i>And what did Superman do?</i>

<i>Did he curl up next to a piece
of kryptonite and die? No.</i>

<i>That crazy lady, Mrs. Teschmacher,
jumped into the pool...</i>

<i>...and took the necklace off of him
so he could fight back.</i>

<i>We have to be that crazy lady
that take the necklace off of Joel.</i>

<i>All right, little Timmy O'Shaemus,
that's enough.</i>

<i>Here's a dollar.
Go play somewhere else.</i>

<i>Oh, jeepers. Thanks, mister.</i>

<i>So I go back to your original question.
Clueless?</i>

<i>Perhaps you meant "brilliant. "</i>

<i>No, I didn't mean that.
You're still an idiot.</i>

<i>- Joel is never gonna agree to do this.
Well, you leave that up to me.</i>

<i>I can persuade Joel. He trusts me.</i>

<i>What the hell are you doing, Wyatt?</i>

<i>Relax, man, 87 percent of the time,
there's no permanent side effects.</i>

<i>You drugged him?</i>

<i>- Help me get his limp body into the car.
Are you out of your...?</i>

<i>Now, what are you two boys up to?</i>

<i>- Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
Hey.</i>

<i>Something fishy's going on here.</i>

<i>- Is that a new perfume?
I don't smell a thing.</i>

<i>You know what, you got a little
something on your mouth right there.</i>

<i>- Wyatt!
Now, just breathe in. Take it in.</i>

<i>Relax, you're going to sleepybye,
sleepybye.</i>

<i>All right, don't worry.</i>

<i>She won't remember a thing.
But she might lose bladder control.</i>

<i>Wyatt, you are freaking
out of your mind, man.</i>

<i>This is not a fun trip.
This is not starting well.</i>

<i>I mean, look at him,
look at that punim.</i>

<i>He looks so peaceful.</i>

<i>He looks like somebody famous.</i>

<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

<i>Got you some eggs there.</i>

<i>Might wanna eat up.</i>

<i>Gonna need your strength.</i>

<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

<i>- Where are we?
West Virginia.</i>

<i>It's for lovers.</i>

What? What?

<i>Okay, try and follow me, Joel.</i>

<i>I can hear you fine.</i>

<i>What the hell are we doing?</i>

<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

<i>- We drugged you.
Yeah.</i>

<i>We're travelling
across the country to L. A...</i>

<i>...so you can kick the crap
out of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>Dr. Dwayne?</i>

<i>I went to school with Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>- Really?
Yep.</i>

<i>Said I was special in my own way.</i>

<i>You know, you're special
in your own way.</i>

<i>Felt me up.</i>

<i>Now say,
"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. "</i>

<i>- Say it, " I'm cuckoo...
I'm cuckoo...</i>

<i>...for Cocoa Puffs. " Yeah.
... for Cocoa Puffs?</i>

<i>And then dumped me on prom night.</i>

<i>You tell him Muriel says rot in hell,
bitch.</i>

All right.

<i>I'll go start the car.</i>

<i>Need to look for a new job tomorrow.</i>

<i>Worse comes to worst,
I can always go back...</i>

...to babysitting.

<i>Oh, boy.</i>

<i>Steady now.</i>

<i>Probably not a good time
to mention the moustache?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>This gravel feels like shiatsu.</i>

<i>Look, Joel, I...</i>

<i>You're not a loser,
and I wasn't trying to say that.</i>

<i>Look, it's okay.</i>

<i>You're right.</i>

<i>I'm 24 years old, with a college degree,
I rent out bowling shoes for a living.</i>

<i>You used to rent out bowling shoes.</i>

<i>Who could blame Deb?
I would've dumped me too.</i>

<i>I don't even know
why you guys hang out with me.</i>

<i>I mean, when we were kids,
yeah, yeah...</i>

<i>...I was the one on the block
with the trampoline.</i>

<i>But I don't even have that anymore.</i>

<i>My dad put it on eBay...</i>

<i>...without even asking me.</i>

<i>Actually, I was kind of hanging out
with you because you had Nintendo.</i>

<i>Your dad still has that, right?</i>

<i>Look, this road trip
was a really cool idea. It is. I just...</i>

<i>It's not gonna make things go back
to the way they were.</i>

<i>Buddy, it's not about going back.</i>

<i>This is about your happiness.
This is about standing up for yourself.</i>

<i>So what? Who cares, man?</i>

<i>Worst case scenario, you get
a road trip with your two best friends.</i>

<i>Come on, buddy. Road trip?</i>

<i>Friends?</i>

<i>- Wieners.
Wieners.</i>

You know what?

<i>- Yeah, okay, let's do it.
Really?</i>

<i>Yeah, screw it. Let's go to L.A.
And let's put the smack on.</i>

<i>- Well, down.
What?</i>

<i>You don't put the smack on,
you put the smack down.</i>

It is smack down. Wyatt is right.

<i>Oh, yeah, Joel.</i>

<i>We made you look like Adolf Hitler.</i>

<i>That's pretty funny.</i>

<i>Oh, hi. Sorry, excuse me.</i>

Damn.

<i>Hello, pimping.</i>

<i>Oh, okay.</i>

<i>- Think I should talk to her?
Of course.</i>

<i>- She could be the one.
I look like an idiot, a diabetic.</i>

<i>- You do look like an idiot, so what?
You need to go.</i>

<i>Put it down. Put it in the van.
What're you talking about? Let's do it.</i>

<i>- Hi.
Hey.</i>

<i>- Check out the getaway sticks on her.
All right.</i>

<i>Did you see that gun?</i>

<i>I'm telling you guys, Jack La Lanne
is a modern day prophet.</i>

<i>I'm gonna help you guys out
with that round tyre...</i>

<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

<i>Get that thing out of here.
Get that thing out.</i>

<i>Get that damn...</i>

<i>You got a little something on your face
there, boys. I don't know.</i>

I don't know what it is.

<i>Janet, what in the diggity wiggity
happened to you?</i>

<i>My idiot brother shot me
with his BB gun.</i>

<i>Why would you do that, Tommy,
why?</i>

<i>- I was cleaning the gun and it went off.
Whatever.</i>

<i>- It was an accident.
No, it wasn't.</i>

<i>Hang on, let's get our stories straight,
okay, partners?</i>

<i>Now, Tommy, you were just sort
of cleaning your BB gun...</i>

<i>...and all of a sudden it went off
like that?</i>

<i>Like that?</i>

<i>Like that? How about that?</i>

<i>How about that, son? Huh?</i>

<i>All right, let me ask,
how is this all gonna go down?</i>

<i>I've never been in a fight before,
guys.</i>

<i>No, hey, that's not true.</i>

<i>That slap fight you had
with Adam Heiman in the third grade?</i>

<i>- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.</i>

<i>I'm pretty sure I lost that one.</i>

<i>- Yeah.
You put up a good fight, though.</i>

<i>His right arm was like orangutan strong
because he didn't have a left one.</i>

<i>It's true. You know, that thing
was practically bionic.</i>

<i>I did my best, though.</i>

<i>Seriously, sometimes I thought when
he was going to pick something up...</i>

<i>...that I could hear that:</i>

<i>Oh, good times, good times.</i>

<i>Is it sad that the only fight
I've ever been in...</i>

<i>...was with a 7-year-old
one- armed boy?</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Hell, yeah.</i>

<i>There's the exit. Fire up the hot pot.</i>

<i>We got our first stop on the tour:
Bilbo, Tennessee.</i>

<i>Hot dogs, get your free hot dogs here.
Anybody want a hot dog?</i>

<i>I'm giving them away free.</i>

<i>Free means no money.</i>

<i>Come and get your free hot dog now,
better than candy.</i>

<i>Wyatt, can we please
move on to the next town?</i>

<i>This one is obviously dead.</i>

No.

<i>I'm not leaving Bilbo, Tennessee,
till I give out at least one free hot dog.</i>

<i>- Folks, it's time to get up...
I can't take the stench anymore.</i>

I'm going for a walk.

<i>Yeah, I could move around too.</i>

<i>Hot dogs. Come on and get them.</i>

<i>Oh, boy.</i>

<i>Can you handle the mob
on your own?</i>

<i>Hot dogs. Somebody want
a free hot dog? Anyone?</i>

<i>Anybody, free hot dog.</i>

<i>Anyone, anybody?</i>

<i>Sir, do you want a free hot dog, sir?
Use a free hot dog?</i>

<i>Hello, sir, you want a free hot dog?</i>

<i>What did you do to them?</i>

<i>Nothing, sir.
It's just a free hot dog.</i>

<i>Some kind of trick?</i>

No. It's not a trick.

<i>So how old are you?</i>

<i>Twenty-four.</i>

<i>- Bring one over.
All right.</i>

<i>Hey, did you want any mustard,
or ketchup...</i>

<i>Or relish, or anything like that?</i>

<i>Just the meat'll do.</i>

<i>All right, here.</i>

<i>Try this, see how you like...</i>

<i>Wait a second.</i>

Not bad.

<i>Pretty quiet out here today.</i>

<i>We must be the only two people
out here for miles.</i>

<i>Just me...</i>

...and you.

<i>My friends just went for a walk.</i>

<i>You know, they'll probably be back
any minute.</i>

<i>You smell like beef and sweat.</i>

<i>Probably a short walk.
They gonna... Coming...</i>

<i>Hush, now.</i>

<i>Let me take you away from all this.</i>

I wanna stay.

<i>Kierkegaard, schmierkegaard.
The guy's a...</i>

<i>Get in the van!</i>

<i>- Get in the van. Get in the van!
What?</i>

<i>- Wyatt, calm...
Get in the van now!</i>

<i>I will leave you!
Get in the van right now, let's go!</i>

<i>Man, let's go.</i>

<i>- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.</i>

<i>- Calm down, calm down.
Wyatt, Wyatt.</i>

<i>- Buddy, what happened?
Nothing.</i>

<i>- Nothing happened.
Okay, nothing happened.</i>

What is wrong with you?
What's wrong?

<i>What would be wrong with you if
some guy was sucking on your finger?</i>

<i>Dude, what are you talking about?</i>

I'm talking about cowboy boots
and man-gina.

<i>One minute, I was giving him
a free hot dog...</i>

<i>...and the next thing I know,
he had my finger in his mouth.</i>

I don't wanna talk about it.

<i>Buddy, that's...
You're fine, that's cool.</i>

<i>- Settle down, it's perfectly normal.
Really?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Just forget about it, forget about it.
You're fine. You're fine.</i>

<i>- We're fine.
He's fine. We're fine, you're fine.</i>

<i>- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, right?
Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>- Oh, hey, Ben.
Yes, my friend.</i>

<i>I was thinking, Kentucky Fried Chicken
for lunch.</i>

<i>- That's a good one.
Yes.</i>

<i>I could go for good chicken.</i>

<i>I'm picking up
what you're laying down.</i>

<i>You know, I might even go so far
as to say...</i>

<i>...that it's finger- licking good.
Yeah.</i>

<i>You guys are assholes.</i>

<i>A guy sucked on your finger?</i>

<i>Yeah, like your dad used to suck
on your balls.</i>

<i>Masturbating in an elevator?
Ding-ding, going down.</i>

<i>How about that?</i>

<i>- Hey. Hey, what's going on?
Hey, just relaxing.</i>

<i>- Where the hell's Wyatt?
Washing his finger. Still.</i>

<i>Get up, get dressed. We're going out.
I scoped out this place down the street.</i>

<i>- I'm watching something.
Oh, oh, TV, well, that's not bad.</i>

<i>Well, what's on, let me see?
Those are the channels...</i>

<i>Oh, I accidentally turned it off.</i>

<i>We're going to the bar.
It'll be good therapy for you.</i>

<i>You can get drunk
and talk about your feelings.</i>

I don't know. L...

I go through ups and downs.

<i>I guess...</i>

...you know...

<i>...maybe I loved her.</i>

<i>I know it sounds cliché, but I...</i>

<i>I feel empty on the inside.</i>

<i>It's like I'm hollow.</i>

<i>Oh, honey, do you wanna put
your face in my boobs again?</i>

<i>I guess.</i>

<i>I don't know, buddy,
is this really helping Joel?</i>

<i>You smell great.</i>

<i>Yeah, this was definitely a good call.</i>

<i>Oh, time expired already, baby?</i>

<i>Well...</i>

<i>...let's feed that meter.</i>

<i>You forgot one.</i>

<i>You guys, I'm cold.</i>

<i>Can't we put the comforter on?</i>

<i>No, man, haven't you seen those
20/20 episodes?</i>

<i>I'm not cuddling up
next to someone else's jiz.</i>

<i>Too late for that, dude.</i>

<i>You're an idiot.</i>

<i>Would you both please shut up?</i>

<i>- Good night, Ben.
Good night, Wyatt.</i>

<i>- Good night, Joel.
Good night, Wyatt.</i>

<i>Good night killers of Arkansas,
lurking outside our window.</i>

Damn.

<i>I'm sleeping in the van.</i>

<i>What the...?</i>

<i>Well, well, well.</i>

<i>Welcome to Tofu Town, boys.</i>

<i>What the hell was that?</i>

<i>That's frigging defamation of character
right there.</i>

That is disgusting.

<i>That is the sexiest loogie
ever hawked.</i>

What?

<i>- She was hot.
Dude, it was like her mouth ejaculated.</i>

<i>- I know.
She's gonna get out here and clean it.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Let's be honest, she probably
didn't even know she did it.</i>

<i>She probably didn't even notice.
Maybe she was coughing, I don't know.</i>

<i>I know people have that problem.</i>

<i>I've been hit in the face before.
There's nothing you can do...</i>

<i>No, no, no,
that loogie had a purpose.</i>

<i>Dude.</i>

<i>Dude, dudes, wait a minute.
This is perfect.</i>

<i>The loogie cementing itself
to my windshield?</i>

<i>No, no, Wyatt.</i>

<i>This is a perfect practise run
for Joely.</i>

<i>- No.
Yes.</i>

<i>Hell yes, buddy.
You're gonna get in there.</i>

<i>You're gonna confront those hippies
head on. Head on, baby.</i>

<i>What are they gonna do,
hug you to death?</i>

<i>- This is a perfect first step.
Yes.</i>

<i>Come on, you go in there
and you tell them.</i>

<i>They don't clean that stuff off,
you'll go psycho on their shit.</i>

<i>Psycho on their shit.</i>

<i>No, I'm not going psycho
on anybody's shit.</i>

<i>You're so frigging lame.</i>

<i>Let me show you how it's done.
Lesson number one.</i>

<i>It all starts when I get up
and make eye contact.</i>

<i>I rise.</i>

<i>I shift into attack mode.</i>

And now...

<i>...we dance.</i>

<i>Hey, bitches.</i>

<i>Bitches, huh?
Well, this should be fun.</i>

<i>I think you might've left something
on my windshield.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. It's a loogie.</i>

I know what it is.

<i>Do you also know that big hunk
of flesh...</i>

<i>...with your bright smiley face on it...</i>

<i>...promotes the violent death of
innocent animals everywhere you go?</i>

<i>What're you doing but driving around
in a big giant sponge...</i>

<i>It's tofu. It's a soy-based
meat alternative, hello.</i>

<i>Oh, well, hot dogs are meat-based
soy alternatives.</i>

<i>How you like me now...?</i>

<i>You better go back over
to your cavemen friends...</i>

<i>...before I hawk another one
in your face.</i>

<i>Easy chief. We can handle this.</i>

<i>Okay, so it sounds to me like,
number one, you're not apologising.</i>

<i>Two, you're not gonna
clean that thing of my windshield?</i>

<i>A for the weenie guy.</i>

<i>Sarcasm. That's how it's gonna be?
Well, let me tell you how I'm gonna be.</i>

<i>Full of meat.</i>

<i>You know what,
you won't be needing this.</i>

<i>Steak sauce, you don't need that.</i>

<i>What, you gonna put steak sauce
on tofu?</i>

<i>It ain't steak.</i>

<i>So how did that go, chief?</i>

<i>Well, you know, I said what I needed
to say when I said it.</i>

<i>To establish authority, you dig?</i>

<i>They'll think twice about messing
with us again, thank you.</i>

<i>No. One, two, three, four, five. No.
One, two, three, four, five.</i>

<i>No, oh, it's gone.</i>

<i>Oh, it's definitely gone.</i>

<i>My hood ornament, man...</i>

<i>Oh, wait a second.</i>

<i>You guys are funny guys.
You took my winged wiener.</i>

<i>Please...</i>

<i>...tell me it was you.</i>

<i>I am going to kill every bone
in those hippies' bodies.</i>

<i>Yeah, you can't really kill a bone,
dude.</i>

<i>Without that hood ornament,
my vehicle isn't regulation.</i>

<i>- I could get fired.
You don't work for the company.</i>

<i>Not the point.
I need my hood ornament, man.</i>

<i>- Are you feeling me?
Could be anywhere by now.</i>

<i>Man, I have seen it all.
A gigantic hot dog.</i>

<i>- What are you eating?
Bean curd.</i>

<i>Hippies in a big sponge
giving this stuff out for free.</i>

<i>- What do I do to get a free hot dog?
Focus. Where's the sponge?</i>

Took off down that dirt road.

<i>Get in, get in.</i>

<i>I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting in.
I'm getting in.</i>

<i>You mean, I don't get
my free hot dog?</i>

<i>- Oh, there they are.
Wyatt, slow it down.</i>

<i>- This thing was built for speed.
Really?</i>

<i>A giant hot dog built for speed?</i>

Holy shit.

What...? What is that?
That's nothing.

<i>Help me.</i>

<i>They're dragging my...</i>

<i>Wyatt, Wyatt.</i>

<i>Slow this thing down, man,
I'm serious.</i>

<i>I've got some major pucker factor
going on right now.</i>

<i>Take your foot
off the accelerator now.</i>

<i>- You take it...
They're just right over...</i>

<i>I did not go on this trip to be spinning
around in a giant hot dog.</i>

<i>Oh, look at my baby.</i>

<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

<i>No wonder I've been rejected
11 times.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, it's totally fixable.</i>

<i>Glue's come a long way.</i>

<i>Joel. Joel, look at this, is it...?
Am I bleeding?</i>

<i>- Dude, it's just a bump.
Oh, yeah? You are such an idiot.</i>

Shut up.
You shut up.

<i>- Guys, come on.
No. No, Joel, he's a moron.</i>

<i>He acts like an idiot
and we have to pay the price.</i>

<i>That's why your nose is gushing blood,
and I've got a lump on my head.</i>

<i>- Your entire head is a lump.
I'm done talking to you.</i>

<i>I'm done talking to you
for the rest of the trip.</i>

<i>I already started.</i>

<i>- Look at this.
Stupid wiener.</i>

<i>Remember when Ian Rosenbluth...</i>

<i>...would wedge the chalk into the
eraser in Doc Summergrad's class?</i>

<i>And every time Summergrad would
go to the board and try to erase...</i>

<i>...he'd get that fatty streak of chalk?
It was amazing.</i>

<i>That kid was great.
Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Lan Rosenbluth, he's a genius.</i>

<i>Oh, did you...? Did you see that sign?
Did you see that?</i>

<i>That's a sign. That's a sign,
that's what this trip is all about.</i>

<i>My best friends
helping me take a stand.</i>

<i>Hey, and look at me.
You know, look at me, it's working.</i>

<i>I'm not scared of that.
I wasn't scared of that at all.</i>

<i>Punch that poster in the face.
Turn around.</i>

<i>Turn around, I wanna punch
that poster in the face.</i>

What do you guys think of that?

<i>Come on, I wanna hear your thoughts.
I'm listening now.</i>

Nothing? Nothing at all?

<i>I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God, I mean it.</i>

<i>- I've always wanted to do it.
Hey. All right, all right, dude, stop.</i>

<i>Close the door.</i>

<i>- Say something to Ben, Wyatt.
Why I gotta go first?</i>

<i>- Oh, God, Wyatt.
Oh, God, Ben.</i>

<i>Apologise, please.</i>

<i>I'm sorry that I called you
a moron and an idiot.</i>

<i>Thank you.
I'm sorry I said your head was a lump.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Didn't even ask for that.
That was great, that was good.</i>

<i>What the...? Hey, what do you say...</i>

<i>...we go rediscover friendship?</i>

<i>Come on, let me get a lollipop.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>You're not so happy anymore,
are you?</i>

<i>Boobies!</i>

<i>What planet are you from, Cody?</i>

<i>Do you see what I am dealing with,
Dr. Dwayne?</i>

<i>I mean, his teachers think
he's a mental case.</i>

<i>Liz Anne, help is on the way,
my friend.</i>

<i>Just for you,
a copy of my latest and greatest:</i>

<i>Earth to Mom, What to do
When Your Kid Thinks He's an Alien.</i>

<i>And if all else fails, you can use it
to knock something loose.</i>

<i>"Cloozy, cleazy, clucky" that.</i>

Buy my book.

<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody calm down, calm down.</i>

<i>All right, who needs a napkin?</i>

<i>You make me wanna scream...</i>

...and pull my hair out
and just go:

<i>I'll take one.</i>

<i>I got a peanut butter dog.
Do you want one of those?</i>

Got it right.

<i>Don't forget. Wyatt's Wieners,
you can't beat them.</i>

<i>- We did real good today, guys.
I'm pretty happy.</i>

<i>Man, this day
could not get any better.</i>

<i>Hi, boys.</i>

<i>Can we have a hot dog?</i>

<i>You know, I don't know if we have...</i>

<i>You know, we have three left,
actually.</i>

<i>- Perfect.
Yes, you are.</i>

<i>Why are you guys so wet?</i>

<i>Well, we all got dumped yesterday
by our boyfriends.</i>

<i>What better way to get over things
than to go on the log flume.</i>

<i>That is such an awesome plan.</i>

<i>We also wanted to make out
with some guys...</i>

<i>...so we could feel better
about ourselves.</i>

<i>Would you guys be okay with that?</i>

<i>- One second.
Yeah, just one minute.</i>

<i>We accept your offer. Begin.</i>

<i>You want your gum back?
Because...</i>

<i>I'll keep it.</i>

<i>Bless you.</i>

<i>Wet girls.</i>

<i>All right, boys, we should be
in Flaglestown by 8.</i>

<i>Not if you continue to drive 30
miles an hour, man. Come on.</i>

<i>- Move your wiener.
That's illegal.</i>

<i>Hey. Tuck your ass in, old lady.</i>

<i>Wyatt, why are old people passing us?
What is going on?</i>

<i>I don't know. The pedal
must be busted. I'm flooring it.</i>

<i>Could it be that your gas tank
is on empty?</i>

Crap.

<i>Hey, slow up there... Jesus Christ.</i>

<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

<i>Come on, witch...</i>

<i>Hey, lady.</i>

<i>Hey. Gotta stop.</i>

<i>Come on... This is bullshit.</i>

<i>Calm down,
you're gonna hurt yourself.</i>

<i>Hey, we got an RV, boys.</i>

<i>What makes you think
an RV is gonna pick us up?</i>

<i>Come on, man, we surrender.</i>

<i>Hey, he's stopping.</i>

<i>He's stopping, come on.</i>

<i>He's stopping.</i>

<i>Hey, he's stopping.</i>

<i>- Oh, man.
He's stopping.</i>

<i>He's stopping.</i>

<i>I'm Felicia Applebaum,
and that's my husband Frank.</i>

<i>- Oh, I'm Wyatt.
I'm Ben.</i>

<i>I'm Joel.</i>

<i>Hey, this is nice.</i>

<i>Hey, it's just like having the kids
in the car again.</i>

<i>No, we just really appreciate
the ride.</i>

<i>- Don't worry about it.
Oh, nonsense. Happy we can help out.</i>

<i>So where are you guys from?</i>

<i>- From Chitown, Joel.
Chicago.</i>

<i>- The Windy City.
Cool.</i>

<i>But now we are just touring
God's green earth.</i>

<i>It's the life, boys.</i>

<i>No commitments, we go wherever
we want, whenever we want.</i>

<i>- That's awesome.
Yeah.</i>

Cool.

<i>Me and the missus, we've made
love in 34 states.</i>

<i>We're driving along,
we get a hankering, we pull over...</i>

<i>...right there in the back seat,
where you're sitting.</i>

<i>Might be some stains back there.</i>

<i>- I cleaned them.
Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>We collected a decal
from every state we've made it in.</i>

<i>Yeah, we got decals from 34 states,
and the District of Columbia.</i>

<i>The Washington Monument,
sticking straight up in the air?</i>

<i>Hey, those tourists'll never forget it.</i>

<i>Are you guys hungry?</i>

<i>Oh, I've got some trail mix, okay.</i>

<i>And I've got some homemade
dried apricots.</i>

<i>Frank here bought me a dehydrator
for our anniversary.</i>

<i>- Just the one.
Okay.</i>

Okay.
Thanks.

<i>Who wants a treat?</i>

<i>Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.</i>

<i>Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.</i>

<i>Give Daddy a kiss.</i>

<i>Down, girl, down. Down.
It's okay.</i>

<i>Daddy'll give you a bone later.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, the kids loved that one.</i>

<i>How many kids do you have?</i>

<i>Three boys. Three tigers.</i>

<i>Yes, sir, they know their way
around the ladies.</i>

<i>Yeah, our oldest, Carl, he lost
his virginity when he was 16.</i>

<i>- Back of a Chevy.
No, honey, that was Bob.</i>

<i>Carl was down in the basement
on top of the dirty clothes.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. Jesus, screaming,
all that noise.</i>

<i>- I thought the cat was in heat.
Oh, I know. We don't have a cat.</i>

<i>So have you guys
been to the festival before?</i>

<i>No, I've never been to Flaglestown.</i>

<i>Yeah, us too. Us too, us too.</i>

<i>Virgin territory for me
and my freaky-deaky.</i>

<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

<i>- Yes.
We might have to christen it?</i>

<i>- I hope so. I'm so ready.
Ready?</i>

Right now.
All right.

<i>- Somebody grab the wheel.
No! No, no, no!</i>

<i>Oh, I'm watching old people do it.</i>

<i>And again, you have our number
if you need a place to crash.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, but be prepared.</i>

<i>There might be da noise
and or da funk...</i>

<i>...being brought in tonight.</i>

<i>Look at you, you are so hip.</i>

<i>Oh, wait, hey, you got some of
my soft serve on your chin there.</i>

<i>You're so sweet, you're so sweet.
Bye.</i>

I'm a lucky guy.

<i>I mean, you know...</i>

<i>...at least we got a place to crash.</i>

<i>Are you nuts?</i>

<i>That was the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.</i>

<i>Really?</i>

<i>Even more disgusting
than that time we caught your dad...</i>

<i>...in the tub tugging his myagi?
He was scratching.</i>

<i>Didn't know you could
scratch like this.</i>

Shut up.

<i>We agreed that he was...</i>

<i>Dude, do you have my wallet?</i>

<i>What's that, a black thing?
I ain't got your wallet.</i>

<i>- You got my wallet?
No.</i>

<i>Hey, barfy.</i>

<i>Do you have our wallets?</i>

<i>Oh, man, what...?</i>

<i>No, no. Hey.
No, don't bother, don't bother.</i>

<i>What the hell?</i>

<i>Wet girls.</i>

<i>We accept your offer. Begin.</i>

<i>Unbelievable.</i>

<i>I am gonna find those wet bitches
if it's the last thing I do.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

<i>How are you gonna go
about doing that?</i>

<i>I gotta pee.</i>

<i>I'll drive across this state
50 times if I have to.</i>

<i>Really? We need
to make money tonight.</i>

<i>Instead of giving out hot dogs,
we're selling them.</i>

<i>- No. I took an oath.
You didn't take an oath, retard.</i>

<i>I did take an oath,
with myself, oka...?</i>

<i>You don't know everything.</i>

<i>Okay, what's your great idea?</i>

<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

<i>Hey, Timmy O'Shaemus?</i>

<i>Don't you live down the block?</i>

<i>I go where I'm needed, mister.</i>

<i>That's great.</i>

<i>- Can you spare some change?
Oh, Timmy, my wallet...</i>

<i>- I am strapped for cash.
You're a real douche.</i>

<i>And you have a small dick.</i>

<i>What the...?</i>

Timmy?

<i>- I told you what the plan is.
No, you didn't.</i>

<i>- Yes, I did.
No.</i>

<i>- Why are you provoking me?
Check this out.</i>

<i>It's perfect.</i>

<i>You shopping for thongs
or something?</i>

<i>Thongs? What? No... Oh, no.
No, no, no.</i>

<i>Hot bod competition.
For buff boy here.</i>

<i>- No. No.
Yes. Yes.</i>

<i>You know that I don't like
competitive stuff.</i>

<i>He forgot to read the fine print,
$10 entry fee.</i>

<i>We don't have cash,
last time I checked.</i>

<i>Crap, we need $10?</i>

<i>Are you Wyatt Fabio Goldstein?</i>

<i>- Yeah.
I've been looking for you for 15 years.</i>

<i>Here you go.</i>

<i>I finally can retire now.
That was my last delivery.</i>

<i>I'm free.</i>

<i>Vacations, singles cruises,
Club Med, Hawaii.</i>

<i>I've got my whole life ahead of me.</i>

<i>Life begins today.</i>

What is it?

I don't know.

<i>It looks like it's a card or something
from my nana.</i>

<i>"Happy Birthday, Wy-Wy,
you're a perfect 10.</i>

<i>Don't spend it all in one place. "</i>

Good old Nana.

<i>I love her.</i>

<i>Candy's on me, boys. No king-size.</i>

<i>Wait. Did you actually count that?
Yeah, that's 10. Here you go.</i>

<i>Bingo. You're in. All right.</i>

<i>We'll get more.
We'll get more.</i>

<i>- I hate you both.
You better win.</i>

<i>He's kind of hot.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>But he's got that beer gut.</i>

<i>No, no, no. No competition.</i>

<i>Yeah, have a couple more beers,
there, cowboy.</i>

<i>Good idea.</i>

You suck.

<i>I smell booty.</i>

<i>Keep your fucking eye on the ball,
Benny.</i>

Run.

<i>Run like you got an ex- con
on your ass.</i>

<i>Take control. You're a defender,
for Christ's sake.</i>

<i>Kick him in the damn shin.</i>

<i>Hey, defence, you suck. Losers.</i>

<i>Hey, Mom,
can I have some Gatorade?</i>

<i>No. You stop fucking up
on the field out there...</i>

<i>...and you can have some Gatorade.
Get out there and kill those bastards.</i>

<i>Come on, hustle.</i>

<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

<i>- What are you doing, man? Get ready.
Come on. It's time to grease up.</i>

<i>Come on, man, snap out of it.</i>

<i>No, Mommy, no more games.</i>

<i>I don't wanna play anymore.</i>

<i>- Hey!
Ben?</i>

<i>What we gonna do for money?</i>

<i>No. No. I'm not gonna...
Get out of the way! Get out!</i>

<i>No, you should know better.
Watch out.</i>

<i>Get out, move, watch it.</i>

<i>He's got a tail like...</i>

<i>Oh, where is fire?</i>

<i>Where is forest fire?</i>

<i>- I'm so sorry.
Hey.</i>

<i>Let me help you up.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
I didn't... Are you okay?</i>

<i>I am fine. But I am built like ox.</i>

<i>You are frail like mosquito.</i>

<i>What is your name?</i>

<i>- I'm Ben.
Ben.</i>

<i>My name is Walrus Boy.
Nice to meet you.</i>

<i>Why you run around here
like scared banshee from hellfire?</i>

<i>I was gonna do
the hot bod competition.</i>

<i>Brilliant! I am on my way there now.</i>

<i>The Countess Carlotta
will be there...</i>

<i>...and I plan on stealing a kiss
from her tonight.</i>

<i>- Come on. Let us go.
No. You don't understand.</i>

<i>- I don't wanna be in the competition.
Why not?</i>

<i>- You have hot bod.
Well, I appreciate that.</i>

<i>- Yeah.
But no. I can't.</i>

<i>- I don't compete. My mother...
Say no more.</i>

<i>Walrus Boy know that tune.</i>

<i>- Come sit on my bails.
Okay.</i>

<i>I have story to tell you, Ben.</i>

<i>The story of a boy.</i>

<i>Born with flipper. He did not have
wiggly fingers like other boys.</i>

<i>He made fun of.</i>

<i>He pelted with rocks.
He was even urinated on, Ben.</i>

<i>Pissed on.</i>

But now...

That boy is famous
Walrus Boy actor.

<i>And that actor would be you?</i>

<i>Of course it is me, Ben.</i>

<i>It's me, Walrus Boy.
I famous actor.</i>

<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

<i>The reason I am successful.</i>

<i>I take negative past
and turn into positive future.</i>

<i>The point is, Ben...</i>

<i>...never let the evil of the past
poison the fruit of your present.</i>

<i>Stupid. What a waste of 10 bucks.</i>

<i>Hey, man,
I said we could have had candy.</i>

<i>Hand me that butter.</i>

<i>Wait a second. Does this mean
that I'm not gonna...?</i>

<i>Whatever.</i>

<i>Let's do this.</i>

<i>What's with the fat guy?</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

<i>Yes! We won!</i>

<i>- I won!
We won! Yes! We won!</i>

<i>- Yeah. Yes. We won!
We won.</i>

<i>Look, I'm smoking, guys.
I don't know what to say.</i>

<i>Thanks, everybody.</i>

<i>Thank you, Flaglestown
and good night.</i>

<i>Man, you were awesome.</i>

<i>That hippity-hopping around
on the stage.</i>

<i>- I didn't know you had it in you.
Me neither.</i>

<i>I owe it to Walrus Boy for showing me
to stand up for myself.</i>

Walrus Boy?

You know him?

<i>I just talked to him about
an hour ago.</i>

<i>I didn't get a chance to thank him.</i>

<i>He died in '46.</i>

<i>I'm just messing with you.
We play Hold 'Em on Wednesdays.</i>

<i>I'll tell him you said thanks.</i>

<i>So we got the best suite
Flaglestown has to offer.</i>

<i>Excuse me. Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were amazing out there.</i>

<i>Your body is ripped- tastic.</i>

<i>Hey, thanks, man.</i>

<i>Will you sign my pecs?</i>

<i>Absolutely.</i>

<i>- It's Barri but with an I.
Oh, all right.</i>

<i>All right. Here. B...
That's an awesome name, man.</i>

<i>- I'll just use your nipple to dot the I.
Nice.</i>

Stay firm.

<i>Know what I'm talking about? Ben.</i>

<i>- That's a nice six-pack there, buddy.
Oh, thanks, man.</i>

<i>- But I'd kill for these.
Oh, dude. Come on, man.</i>

<i>- Nice to meet you.
You keep it firm.</i>

<i>Yeah, man, abs not flabs,
you know what I mean?</i>

<i>Stay off the sugar.
Sugar's the enemy.</i>

<i>Yeah, man. No carbs.</i>

<i>Man. You are like a celebrity
around here.</i>

<i>That's so awesome.
You are like a gay celebrity.</i>

<i>- What?
Yeah, that was pretty gay.</i>

<i>You guys touching abs
and stuff like that. That was...</i>

<i>I wonder if he's the prize
at the gay booth?</i>

<i>- Could you sign me?
Yeah, could you sign my abs?</i>

<i>Do something with my belly button.
Do something fun.</i>

<i>- You got nice abs.
No, you have the hotness.</i>

<i>Are you guys... Are you children?</i>

<i>You couple of ass clowns,
you're both pathetic.</i>

<i>You're pathetic slobs.</i>

<i>Mama told me she liked my belly.</i>

<i>It's prosthetic.</i>

<i>- That means rubber.
Yeah.</i>

<i>And I get phantom pains, it itches.</i>

<i>You know,
sometimes I think it was God...</i>

<i>...made me drink that Jägermeister,
stick my arm in that concrete mixer.</i>

<i>So stupid. I don't know what I did,
it must've been real bad.</i>

<i>- I don't know, it's...
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.</i>

<i>Son, listen to me for just a second.</i>

<i>People get sick of hearing
about your stories.</i>

<i>Don't wanna hear them
stupid stories no more.</i>

<i>Yeah, I got your arm.
Yeah, I got your arm.</i>

<i>I'm gonna keep your arm too.
I'm gonna keep it.</i>

<i>What smells like corn on the cob?</i>

<i>You still wearing that butter?</i>

<i>Yeah. I like the way it feels on me.</i>

<i>What's happening to you?</i>

<i>Guys, remember when I said I had
a surprise for you in New Mexico?</i>

No.
No.

<i>Oh, I forgot.</i>

<i>I have a surprise for you
in New Mexico.</i>

<i>I'll give you a hint: Sixth grade.</i>

Miss Isaac?

<i>- Hottest teacher ever.
You're kidding, right?</i>

<i>No, remember
when she used to say...</i>

<i>...she would quit it all
and move to New Mexico?</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Well, colour me Google...</i>

<i>...because I found her on the Internet.
And I told her we'll be driving through.</i>

Miss Isaac.

<i>Parallelogram.</i>

<i>Miss Boobies.</i>

<i>I've dreamt about this day for years.</i>

<i>What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?</i>

Look who it is.

<i>I never thought I'd see
you little birds again.</i>

<i>Bet you missed these.</i>

<i>- Miss Isaac?
Who else do you think it is, dumbass?</i>

<i>Give me a squeeze.</i>

<i>Well, Wyatt, I see you still got
that twisted hot dog obsession, huh?</i>

<i>Nice.</i>

<i>Don't stand there like a bunch
of boners, lunch is on in five.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Thank you for ruining
my sixth grade fantasy.</i>

<i>- She's so disgusting.
Guys, she's still a person.</i>

<i>Is she?</i>

<i>It's hot as crotch out here.
I'm sweating my balls off.</i>

<i>You know what you boys need?</i>

<i>A Mexican blowjob.</i>

<i>- A what?
Mexican blowjob.</i>

<i>Tequila, whipped cream.</i>

<i>Tequila?</i>

It's 11:30.

<i>- You know, for me that's early...
Yeah, I mean, it's...</i>

<i>That's too early for...</i>

<i>- Down the hatch.
Okay. One shot.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>That really gets you going.</i>

<i>- Come on, bitches.
Miss Isaac, I really shouldn't.</i>

I'm driving.

<i>We all need to be alert
because we're all navigators.</i>

<i>We need to keep our eyes
on the road.</i>

<i>Wise words.
But do I want to get drunk?</i>

<i>I wanna get drunk,
but we gotta go, so...</i>

<i>Fine, you pansies. Fine.</i>

<i>- You don't need...
Careful with your teeth.</i>

How many was that?

<i>I think that was five.</i>

<i>Five.</i>

<i>Time for lunch, eses.</i>

<i>Hope you like egg salad,
it's my speciality.</i>

All right.

<i>That's a really healthy way
to prepare that.</i>

<i>So you live by yourself out here?</i>

<i>Ever since that rat bastard left me
for the gas station slut.</i>

<i>Hope she likes wearing the ball gag.</i>

I don't miss that.

<i>Well, you know what they say...</i>

<i>...that every cloud...</i>

<i>That every cloud has...</i>

<i>Something.</i>

<i>So now it's just me and my Benny...</i>

<i>...named after my favourite student.</i>

<i>Come to Mama, Benny.</i>

<i>How's life treating you boys?</i>

<i>Just fine, I guess.</i>

<i>Well, it was nice
to visit your old teach.</i>

<i>You haven't changed a bit.</i>

<i>You, either?</i>

<i>Yeah, right.</i>

<i>How do you
like living out here by yourself?</i>

<i>- Are you happy out here?
What is not to love, you know?</i>

<i>I am living
like a New Mexican queen.</i>

<i>Enough, all right? Enough.</i>

<i>Any who, guess what I made
you boys for dessert?</i>

Tapioca pudding.

<i>And I made it
with my own two hands.</i>

<i>I think I ate that sandwich
too fast. It was tasty.</i>

<i>- We gotta go. I just realised.
Yeah.</i>

<i>- We're on the clock.
I thought this was a booty call...</i>

Miss Isaac?

<i>- What the hell just happened?
Is she dead?</i>

I don't know.

<i>- And I don't wanna find out.
I've never checked a pulse.</i>

<i>- Get it, touch her wrist.
I don't wanna...</i>

<i>- She's back.
That narcolepsy's a bitch.</i>

<i>Sometimes I'm out for a few seconds,
sometimes a few hours.</i>

<i>I better say goodbye
to you boys now.</i>

<i>Once they start...</i>

<i>Dude, what the hell
is wrong with this lady?</i>

<i>We are leaving right now.
Right.</i>

<i>Well, I mean, should we, well,
I guess she said goodbye.</i>

<i>Yeah, she said goodbye.
We're saying goodbye right now.</i>

<i>Thank you for lunch, Miss Isaac,
bye- bye.</i>

<i>Thanks, Miss Isaac.
Bye- bye.</i>

<i>You can't just leave her here
like this.</i>

<i>- Just get in and shut up!
Ben.</i>

<i>Let me just... I'll just put something
underneath so she...</i>

<i>At least she doesn't hurt her head
or anything.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

Wyatt.

<i>Come on, come on.</i>

Hurry!

<i>I still can't believe
that's the same person.</i>

<i>I still can't believe
that's the same person.</i>

<i>Yeah, she was pretty narsty.</i>

<i>I don't think I can jerk off
to her anymore.</i>

You don't think?

<i>- Hey, buddy.
Hey, man.</i>

<i>- Antacid?
What, you nervous or something?</i>

<i>No, it's just that... Come on.</i>

<i>I thought since we was a couple
days away you was getting nervous.</i>

What? No.

<i>No, no, that's funny, though,
that's funny.</i>

<i>No, it's...</i>

<i>It's a couple days away.</i>

<i>Well, that's good.</i>

<i>- Let's go, boys.
Let's go.</i>

<i>Help me, Wyatt.</i>

<i>Don't put on too much gel, damn it.</i>

<i>You need to lose
some of that extra weight.</i>

<i>I don't like looking at your rolls
when I'm getting my makeup done.</i>

<i>No one should have to watch
that shit jiggle.</i>

<i>Who the hell is that in my studio?</i>

<i>I think it's time to shut you up.</i>

<i>Permanently.</i>

<i>Dwayne.</i>

<i>Joel, you're shaking
in your boots, son.</i>

<i>And I bet right about now,
your palms are sweatier...</i>

<i>...than a fat man's ass crack
on a hot Georgia day.</i>

<i>Oh, Joel, even in your dreams...</i>

<i>...you're a pathetic coward!</i>

<i>It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.</i>

<i>I can tell you miss the smell
in your dumb ass face.</i>

<i>You can't beat me, Joel.</i>

<i>I'm a PhD doctor, son.</i>

<i>Where's Joel?</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

What?

<i>Where's Joel?</i>

<i>What the...?</i>

<i>There's a note on my chest.</i>

Look at this.

<i>"Guys, I'm really sorry to do this... "</i>

<i>But I have to go home.</i>

<i>I just can't tak e the chance
of getting humiliated again.</i>

<i>This whole thing was a mistak e.</i>

<i>I've tak en 300 bucks
and I'm gonna buy a bus tick et.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>"Joel. "</i>

<i>Wyatt, we have to find him.</i>

<i>All right, Wyatt, let's go.</i>

<i>- Here you go.
Why don't you pick up your bag...?</i>

I'm sorry.

<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

<i>Are you all right?</i>

<i>Bathroom's where I say it is.</i>

<i>What are you looking at?</i>

<i>- Me?
Joel, it's me, Timmy.</i>

<i>Timmy O'Shaemus
from down the block.</i>

<i>You remember.</i>

<i>Timmy, he has too many demons.</i>

<i>Joel, don't give up. Fight him.</i>

<i>You've gotta fight him.</i>

<i>Grape fizz burp.</i>

<i>I'm sure you miss the smell
of those in your dumb ass face.</i>

<i>- Drake?
Who else would it be, stupid bitch?</i>

No.

<i>No. Leave me alone,
leave me alone.</i>

<i>- Leave me alone.
Where are you going, loser?</i>

<i>Where you going, loser?</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Where are you going?</i>

<i>Relax and enjoy the show,
vagina face.</i>

<i>Hey, toolbox, why you digging
in the garbage?</i>

<i>You looking for your filthy mother?</i>

<i>No. I'm reducing,
reusing and recycling.</i>

<i>Mrs. Yazel lets me leave
Math-a-letes early.</i>

<i>I'm in the Recycling Club.</i>

<i>You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche bag.</i>

<i>You're about to join
the Smashed Face Club.</i>

<i>No, Drake. See, I don't
wanna join the Smashed Face Club.</i>

<i>It's entertaining.</i>

<i>Oh, saved by the bell, huh?</i>

<i>- Oh, God.
Or should I say burned by it.</i>

<i>All right, nothing to see here.</i>

<i>Oh, this is my favourite part.</i>

<i>- You remember.
Pull your pants up.</i>

<i>Oh, what, like none of you guys
have ever farted before?</i>

<i>Oh, my God, look.</i>

<i>Gross, it wasn't just a fart.</i>

<i>Poo pants, poo pants,
poo pants, poo pants.</i>

<i>Oh, I hated that name.</i>

<i>It's a good name.</i>

<i>Never again.</i>

<i>Never again!</i>

<i>Pucker up, pussycats.</i>

<i>Now who's the meat?</i>

<i>Hold it right there, you damn,
dirty hippies.</i>

<i>There'll be no branding today.</i>

<i>He had to go.</i>

<i>Welcome back.</i>

<i>Sorry I took so long, boys.</i>

<i>- Yeah!
Yes!</i>

That's right.

<i>- Good work, guys.
Yes, sir.</i>

What got into you?
Right?

<i>That was awesome, man.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

<i>If we ride through the night,
we can reach L.A. By daybreak.</i>

<i>It was a good thing we had all
that climbing rope handy.</i>

<i>Yeah, I heard that.</i>

<i>Guys. Guys, look.</i>

<i>Hollywood, Hollywood.</i>

<i>Ninety-one exit. Next exit.</i>

<i>- Oh, my goodness.
We made it. Hey, Joel...</i>

<i>...I wanna see you kick serious ass.</i>

<i>- The smack is on.
Absolutely.</i>

<i>- Down.
The smack is down, uptown.</i>

<i>I was wondering, is it illegal?</i>

<i>Is that a crime?
You know what I'm saying?</i>

<i>- Could I go to jail for kicking his ass?
Absolutely not.</i>

<i>I think revenge is actually legal
in America, so...</i>

<i>Good morning, ma'am.
See your driver's licence?</i>

<i>Where we going, gentlemen?</i>

<i>It's all right.
I'm here to see Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>- I know him.
You and the rest of America.</i>

<i>You got any tickets?</i>

<i>Not technically,
no, we don't have tickets.</i>

<i>Tough break, kid,
I wish I could help you.</i>

<i>- Now get lost.
What?</i>

<i>- State your name.
What?</i>

<i>State your name.
State your name and purpose.</i>

<i>What are you...?</i>

<i>Oh, my God! She...!</i>

<i>What kind of officer are you, man?</i>

<i>Jesus!</i>

<i>My God, that woman is still twitching.</i>

<i>Jeez, what the hell do we do now?</i>

<i>Hi there.</i>

<i>Sorry, I wanted to actually come over
and apologise...</i>

<i>...for what had happened earlier.</i>

<i>We might have got off
on the wrong foot. I'm Ben.</i>

<i>- Jim.
Nice to meet you, Jim.</i>

<i>Listen, we're not here to break in
to anywhere...</i>

<i>...we're not trying to do anything
wrong. We wanna spread happiness.</i>

<i>Happiness in the form
of a good wiener.</i>

<i>Maybe you'd like a little mustard,
a little ketchup, a little meat.</i>

<i>You're reaching
for your winter parka...</i>

<i>...and it's the Fourth of July, okay?</i>

<i>You can't see the flame from
the firecracker, and you know what?</i>

<i>You are about to blow.</i>

<i>Do you understand me when
I use the word...?</i>

You.

<i>I'll kill you, Dwayne.</i>

<i>Well, well, well.</i>

Boys.

<i>- Joel.
Dr. Dwayne?</i>

<i>There's two of them.</i>

<i>I knew it.</i>

<i>Joel, meet decoy. Decoy, meet Joel.</i>

<i>I'm getting paid, y'all.</i>

<i>You know, you can't be too careful.</i>

<i>I heard about you
after your incident at the gate...</i>

<i>...so I sent decoy out
to do the show, just in case.</i>

<i>That thing on your face
is nasty, son.</i>

<i>Don't look at me, son,
don't look at me.</i>

<i>It's okay, everyone. Okay? I'm okay.</i>

<i>We'll take care of this right away,
Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>Get your hands off of me.</i>

<i>Wait a second, Dwayne.</i>

<i>I came here to say something
and I'm gonna say it.</i>

<i>Okay, boys, keep them rolling.</i>

<i>So, Joel...</i>

...what's on your mind?

<i>My girlfriend dumped me.</i>

I lost my job.

<i>I lived on chips for months.
My life fell to shit because of you.</i>

<i>Joel.</i>

<i>You make my toes perspire,
they're so warm and toasty...</i>

<i>...from the fire inside of you.
And you know what that means?</i>

<i>It means you're a man now.</i>

<i>It means that you have
faced your fears.</i>

<i>It means you overcame
Drake Hanswald.</i>

Wait. What?
How did you know that?

<i>I'm a PhD doctor, son, you can't eat
the onion without peeling it.</i>

<i>I mean, if you think about it,
getting dumped, what I did for you:</i>

<i>Best thing in the world.</i>

Right?

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>You're right.</i>

<i>I think you changed my life
for the better.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Release that prisoner.
Release him to my arms.</i>

<i>Now. Wyatt Fabio Goldstein.</i>

<i>Yeah, what...?</i>

<i>What's happening, Dr. Dwayne?</i>

<i>Rejected 12 times.</i>

<i>That is a whole heap of rejection.</i>

<i>But now, it's surprise time
right here on the Dr. Dwayne Show.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

<i>...Cornelius Worthington III.</i>

<i>How are you, Wyatt? Okay.</i>

<i>Hey, you're that junkie
from behind the dumpster.</i>

<i>Guilty as charged.</i>

<i>Yeah, that was me, everyone.</i>

<i>Down on my luck,
hopped up on gack...</i>

<i>...urinating on myself
just to feel my legs.</i>

<i>But you saved me.</i>

<i>You saved me with a hot dog
and a smile.</i>

<i>- I thank you for it, Wyatt.
No... No problem, junkie man.</i>

Mr. Worthington.

<i>Hey, cut it out, Wyatt.</i>

<i>Let's cut to the chase.</i>

<i>I wanna finance Wyatt's Wieners.</i>

<i>- Really? Are you serious?
Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>- I'm dead serious.
Cornelius Worthington III!</i>

<i>Mama, I got money.
Mama, I got money.</i>

<i>You all see that? Surprises
and dreams come true...</i>

<i>...right here
on the Dr. Dwayne Show.</i>

<i>Gosh darn it, I feel like I just
peeked up the tooth fairy's skirt...</i>

<i>...and poured myself
a plate of lasagna.</i>

<i>That's how I feel.</i>

<i>Tin Man, I bet you got
some fire to get off...</i>

<i>...that perfectly sculpted chest.</i>

You know what?

<i>You know what, Dr. Dwayne?
I think I do.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Ben.</i>

<i>- Hi, Ben.
Listen, I've realised a lot on this trip...</i>

<i>...with my best friends, but the one
thing that I'm realising the most...</i>

<i>...is that this whole rat race...</i>

<i>...this circus that we call life...</i>

<i>...it's really all about love.
L- O-V-E.</i>

<i>And it doesn't matter if you love
someone that's white or black.</i>

<i>Whether you love a girl...</i>

<i>...or you love a man.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Now, that is some insightful chatter,
Ben.</i>

<i>Well, audience.</i>

<i>There's a moonbeam full
of pleasure in the unexpected.</i>

<i>But if you wanna make it
across that pond...</i>

<i>...don't let the fear
of hypothermia keep you...</i>

...from skating right on across it.

<i>If the thing opens up and starts
to swallow you...</i>

<i>...make sure you got a friend
out there...</i>

<i>...to throw you a rope.</i>

<i>- That's a cut.
Now get these fuckers off my set.</i>

<i>Someone get me a soy latte.</i>

<i>Come on, people, I'm Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>- Holy shit, dude.
That was insane.</i>

<i>Unbelievable.</i>

<i>- This trip was a good thing.
Yeah.</i>

Thank you. Thanks.

<i>You know this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.</i>

<i>You're the two best friends
a guy could ever have.</i>

<i>What the...?</i>

<i>Eat egg, you sappy bitch.</i>

<i>No, not my face.</i>

<i>Not my face.
It's my instrument, you bitch.</i>

<i>Did you see that?</i>

<i>This is an accomplishment, Joel.
You've got somebody afraid of you.</i>

<i>People fear me.</i>

<i>I like this.</i>

<i>I think we can go home now.</i>

<i>Ben, can we get serious
for a moment?</i>

<i>Absolutely, man, what's up?</i>

<i>- Do you think I look like Beyoncé?
No.</i>

<i>- I mean, not in the eyes?
No.</i>

<i>- The mouth?
No.</i>

<i>Whatever, you don't know anything.</i>

<i>Get me a soy latte.</i>

<i>Son, you need to look at me
when I'm talking to you.</i>

<i>But Dr. Dwayne, I am looking at you.</i>

<i>Okay, I can't work like this.</i>

<i>Who the hell hired
the cockeyed sumbitch?</i>

<i>Oh, goddamn it, y'all, come on.</i>

<i>I'm Dr. Dwayne.</i>

A mark.

<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

<i>I had a gay moment. I had
my first, my first gay moment.</i>

<i>Gibberish.</i>

<i>- You did not take an oath, retard.
Yes, I did take an oath, with my...</i>

<i>You don't know everything.</i>

<i>F*** me.</i>

<i>I'm gonna back up one.</i>

Hold on.

<i>I'm a team player, here I go.</i>

How many was that?

Shit. Hold on.

<i>He was laughing.</i>

<i>Help her. Help her now.</i>

<i>All right, ready.</i>

<i>- Okay, cut, we'll pick it up.
Sorry.</i>

<i>Grape... F***.
That was his fault.</i>

<i>Clueless?
Perhaps you meant...</i>

<i>...brilliant!
No, I didn't mean...</i>

...brilliant.

<i>I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God.</i>

<i>I mean it, I've always thought
about doing it.</i>

<i>Go ahead,
we're not moving anymore.</i>

<i>Do you understand what I mean?</i>

<i>What I'm talking about
when I say blow?</i>

You... What?

<i>I wasn't supposed to last that long.</i>

<i>I thought you were gonna cut me off.</i>

<i>- Mark.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

<i>It's like a blank canvas,
full of hope and possibilities.</i>

<i>You know, my nana used to say
it was like a naked virgin...</i>

<i>...waiting to be ploughed
from behind...</i>

<i>...while playing with her boobies.</i>

<i>Maybe tickling her anus.</i>

Okay.

<i>Camera set?</i>

<i>When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

<i>Ever heard of him?
Ruined our friend's life.</i>

It's dirty.

<i>I don't like dirt.</i>

<i>Chitown, Joel, the Windy City.</i>

<i>But now we are just touring
God greens...</i>

<i>But now we are just touring God...</i>

<i>But now we are just touring
the earth of something.</i>

<i>- Cut.
Well, we're okay, I guess.</i>

<i>All right. That's enough.</i>

<i>Can you pull this beast off
at the next exit?</i>

That is ridiculous.

<i>No problem.</i>

Hold for coughs.

<i>I smoked so many blunts last night.
All right.</i>

<i>Pull over right now!</i>

<i>A marker.</i>
