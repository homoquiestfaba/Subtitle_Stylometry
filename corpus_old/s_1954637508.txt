[ Heavy breathing ]

[ Woman screaming ]

>> No!

[ Birds cawing ]

[ Crickets chirping ]

[ Woman screams ]

>> Ahhhhhh!

Ahhhhhh!

Ahhhhhh!

>> [ Grunts ]

>> Ahhhhh!

[ Both laugh ]

[ Chuckling ] No.

>> Do you see that?

>> Hmm?

>> That building over there.

>> It's just some old factory.

>> Oh! We should check it out.

>> Are you crazy?

You want to go in<i>there?</i>

>> Come on. It could be cool.

Let's just go inside for a few

minutes.

[ Door creaking ]

Oh! Cool!

>> Okay. We've seen it.

Let's go.

>> We just got here.

>> Yeah, and I think we should

get out before someone shows up.

>> Give me a break, Josh.

This place has probably been

abandoned for years.

[ Crickets chirping ]

I wonder what they made here?

>> Who cares what they made

here, alyson?

This place is a death trap!

>> What's your problem?!

>> Nothing.

I just -- I just don't think

this is a good idea.

That's all.

>> [ Mockingly ] Are you scared?

>> No!

>> Then stop being such a pussy.

>> [ Sighs ]

>> [ Gasps ]

God! This is place is amazing!

I wish I'd brought my camera.

>> Haven't we seen enough?

>> I'm not leaving until I see

every room.

>> Alyson...

>> What?

>> I just heard something.

>> I didn't.

>> It came from over there.

It sounded like footsteps.

>> If you're trying to get me to

leave, it's not working.

>> I think we should go.

>> You're really scared, aren't

you?

You're kind of cute when you're

scared.

>> We should go.

>> Kind of turns me on.

>> Ooh. [ Grunts ]

Are you crazy?!

You want to do this<i>here?!</i>

>> Why not?

No one's gonna bother us.

>> [ Moans ]

[ Both moaning ]

[ Door creaking ]

[ Moaning continues ]

[ Metallic creaking ]

[ Gasps ] Whoa! Whoa!

>> What the fuck?!

>> I saw something!

>> Gimme a break!

There's no one else here!

>> I saw something right there!

>> Whatever.

>> [ Panting ]

I'm not making this up!

>> You are so full of shit.

>> I really saw someth-- where

are you going?

>> I'm gonna have a smoke.

>> I'm coming with you.

>> No. Don't.

>> But, alyson --

>> I just want to be alone for a

minute, okay?

I'll be right back and then we

can leave, all right?

>> Sure.

[ Crickets chirping ]

>> [ Sighs ]

[ Lighter clicks ]

[ Jar thuds ]

[ Metallic scraping ]

[ Gasps ]

>> Alyson?

Alyson!

Alyson?!

Alyson?!

Jesus.

Oh, my God!

Alyson!

[ Flesh tearing ]

[ Coughs ]

[ Gasps ]

>> [ Weakly ] No.

[ Ripping continues ]

No! No! No!

No! No! No!

Ahhhh!

>> [ Gurgling ]

>> No! No!

No! No!

Aaaahhh!

>> [ Coughing, gagging ]

>> Aaaahhh! Ahhhh!

Aaaaahhhh!

Aaaahhhhh!

No! Aaaahhh!

Aaaahhh!

No!

>> Congratulations, Rachel!

You survived your first year of

college.

>> [ Chuckles ]

We should do something to

celebrate, you know?

>> Yeah. Ideas?

Get wasted? Stir up some shit?

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> Wanna come along?

>> Now I know why my parents

always thought you were such a

bad influence.

>> Yeah.

They weren't too thrilled when

they found out we were going to

the same school.

>> No.

>> Rachel! Hey, what's up?

>> Hi, Derek.

>> Louisa.

>> Hello.

>> You all done with classes?

>> [ Chuckling ] Yeah.

That physics exam was a killer.

>> Yeah. Tell me about it.

I was thinking, uh...Me and you

can...Do something tonight.

Yeah?

>> Yeah. [ Chuckles ]

>> I can pick you up around

7:00?

What do you say?

Is tha--

>> sorry, frat boy.

We've got plans.

>> You know, rach, can I --

can I talk to you for a second?

Alone?

>> Yeah.

>> Hey, Louisa.

Can I bum a smoke off you?

>> Get lost, Troy.

>> [ Scoffs ]

Come on.

I'll buy you a pack later.

>> "Later"?

>> Tonight.

>> [ Scoffs ] "Tonight"?

You think I wanna be hanging out

with your lame ass tonight?

>> I don't care what they say

about you, Louisa.

I know you like guys.

Oh, hey.

I don't want no trouble.

>> Too late,<i>pendejo.</i>

>> Nice knife you got there.

>> Yeah, and it's sharp, too.

Wanna touch it?

Now...Who says I don't like

guys?

>> Hey, why are you still

hanging around with Louisa,

anyways?

Huh?

I mean...Everyone knows she's

going nowhere.

>> Derek, she's my best friend.

You know, I mean, we -- we grew

up together.

>> I know. Look.

But you're not a little kid

anymore.

You know, you need to start

making your<i>owndecisions.</i>

>> [ Sighs ]

Just...Don't pressure me, all

right?

>> Just say you'll come with me.

>> [ Scoffs ]

I'll call you later, okay?

All right?

>> Yeah, we both know what<i>that</i>

means.

>> Oh, come on, Derek.

Don't get possessive.

>> I'm not being poss--

>> we're just dating!

Okay?

>> All right.

[ Car horn honking ]

[ Woman shouting ]

>> [ Laughing ]

School is out forever! Whoo-hoo!

>> Whoo! Damn right!

We're gonna get down tonight!

>> You kids crazy or what?

>> Oh, yeah. Okay.

<i>We'recrazy? Look at you!</i>

What are you still doing here?

>> Listen up, y'all.

We're having a party at my house

tonight.

My parents are out of town for

the whole weekend.

The whole place is ours!

Today, it's free rides home for

everybody!

>> Whoo!

>> Sounds like a plan.

What do you say, Rachel?

>> We'll see.

>> Let's do it!

>> I'm all right, Francis.

Hey, do you need a ride?

What about you, homegirl?

You want a ride?

>> Can I smoke in your car?

>> Sure thing.

But that ain't all we're gonna

be smoking!

[ Laughter ]

>> I told you to get lost.

>> Hey. I need a ride, too.

>> Don't worry, Troy.

We ain't gonna be playing no

megadeth in here, a'ight?

>> Don't worry. I'm cool.

>> Nah.

You anything but cool, my man,

but get your heavy-metal ass in

the car so we can be on our way.

>> Whoo! [ Laughs ]

[ Engine revs ]

>> Shit!

>> What's wrong?

>> My folks. They're still here.

>> Ohh.

>> Let me go scope this out.

>> Here.

Put this Anthrax tape in.

>> Dude, give it a rest!

Don't make me kick you out of

the fucking car.

>> We're fucked.

They changed their tickets to

next month.

>> Shit!

>> Dude, that sucks!

>> So now what are we gonna do?

>> I don't know.

We'll figure something out.

Let's just get out here.

>> Nice move, man.

>> How was I supposed to know?

If you're so smart, Louisa, why

don't<i>youcome up with</i>

something?

>> We're waiting to hear it.

>> Okay.

I got an idea.

So you know the old factory on

the edge of town?

>> Yeah.

>> It's been a long time since

I've been there, but it's

probably still around unless the

city tore it down.

>> [ Sarcastically ] Yeah.

That sounds terrific.

>> No. I'm serious.

It's a really cool place.

It's been abandoned for years.

>> W-wait. An abandoned factory?

>> Uh...No way.

>> Don't worry.

I've been there millions of

times.

I used to hang there when I was

a teenager.

>> Sounds cool to me.

>> Oh. Wait. Come on, guys.

You guys don't really wanna

party in some condemned

building.

>> Gimme a break, dude.

You're such a pussy.

>> Yeah, really.

You got a better idea?

>> I'm with Louisa...Long as

it's private, okay?

We're gonna have our own little

private party -- someplace where

we won't be disturbed.

>> Mm-hmm.

>> The whole place is isolated.

>> Okay, so there are a lot of

rooms there, right?

'Cause you know me and Francis

are gonna be needing some

privacy.

[ Both chuckle ]

>> Girl, you got a dirty mind.

>> You love it, don't you?

>> There's plenty of room for

everybody, and we can do

whatever we want.

>> Whoo-wee!

Now, that's what I'm talking

about.

>> Me, too.

>> [ Laughs ]

>> Oh, don't even tell me you're

going along with this.

>> What, Derek?

It could be fun.

>> Ugh.

>> Hey!

And who invited you, anyway?

>> Oh, I'll be there. Yeah.

Just to make sure nothing

happens to Rachel.

>> Good deal.

You and Troy can bring the beer.

And I'll stay here and take care

of the girls.

Right, girls?

[ Laughs ]

>> So, what, are we on?

6:00? Huh?

In front of the old factory.

It's right down on Duncan road.

You can't miss it.

>> Hey. Let's do it.

[ Dogs barking ]

>> No!

[ Barking continues ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Mumbling ]

[ Coughs ]

Ugh.

Ugh.

I told him he got the day all to

himself, but he had to give me a

hard time, so this is what

happened...

[ Groans ]

You're a fuck-up!

Don't...

Do you really want...

Kiss my ass.

[ Grunts ]

[ Belches ]

[ Mumbling, chuckling ]

I told him!

It's not my fault!

The guy poured the drink.

Shit!

[ Springs creaking ]

[ Thud ]

Who's there?

Who's there?!

[ Mumbling ]

Damn dog. I don't know!

[ Mumbling ] ...Stupid.

>> You -- you have to help me!

>> What happened to you?!

>> She killed Josh!

Oh, my God!

She's gonna kill us all!

[ Hyperventilating ]

Please!

We have to get out of here

before she comes back!

>> She? Who's she? Who? Who?

>> She's gonna kill you, too,

if we don't get out of here!

>> I live alone.

There's nobody here.

>> Please! Please!

We have to go now!

We have to go!

We have to go now!

>> Aah!

>> No! No!

Aaaahhhh!

Aaaahhh! No!

[ Heartbeat thumping ]

[ Metallic clanking ]

[ Clanking continues ]

>> [ Hisses ]

>> Aaaahhhhh!

[ Gnawing, flesh tearing ]

[ Vehicle approaches ]

>> Well, this must be the place.

>> Yeah.

Geez! What a dump!

>> Want one?

>> Nah. No thanks.

I don't smoke.

>> That's right.

You wouldn't want to let down

the team.

[ Bottles clink ]

>> Hey, where's Francis?

[ Vehicle approaches ]

>> Whoo!

[<i>Dance music plays]</i>

>> Whoo! [ Laughs ]

You thought we'd hit you, didn't

you?

[ Laughs ]

>> Hi.

>> Wow. You look...Great.

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> Hey, girls.

You all ready to party?

>><i>Muy bonita seÃ±orita.</i>

>> Wow.

>> Thank you.

>> Get your hands off me,

Francis.

>> Chill, girl. Lighten up.

These here are<i>myladies.</i>

>> You can have them.

>> Hey!

>> Yeah. Right.

>> All right. All right.

Let's see it. Let's see it.

>> Cheapest thing they had.

>> Aw, dude.

>> Dang.

Leave it to two white boys to

bring the beer.

Well, good thing I brought my

own shit.

>> Yep.

>> Well, we got the tools.

That ain't all we got.

Leticia?

>> Oh, shit!

[ Cheering ]

Now that's the kind of shit<i>i'm</i>

talking about.

>> This place looks kind of

freaky, don't you think?

Look, rach, ain't nothin' gonna

happen while I'm around, all

right?

>> Ohh. Give me a break.

>> Hey.

Well, what are we waiting for?

Let's party!

I thought you said this place

was wide open.

>> How was I supposed to know it

was gonna be locked up?

Last time I was here, it --

>> yeah. When was that?

>> It must've been at least

eight years.

>> Great.<i>Nowyou tell us.</i>

Hey, I didn't see you come up

with any bright ideas.

>> I knew I shouldn't have gone

with some stupid, fucking

factory.

[ Locks clanking ]

[ Chains rattling ]

Oh, shit! [ Chuckles ]

That was easy!

Sorry, Louisa. [ Chuckles ]

Let's party, people! Let's go!

Man, this party's about to be

on, y'all.

[ Chuckles ]

>> I love this place.

>> Hey! Here's a door.

>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.

We can go in from there.

>> All right.

Derek, why don't you do the

honors of, you know, getting

the door open for us?

>> Go for it!

>> Come on, bad boy!

Show us what you got!

>> Whoo!

[ Clatter ]

[ Laughter ]

[ Scraping ]

>> All right!

All right!

Here we go, y'all!

>> It's dark.

>> Yeah, I'm assuming there's no

electricity in this place, huh?

>> What do you think?

>> Don't worry about it.

That's why I brought these.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Get out.

>> Let's party, people.

The party's officially underway!

[ Chuckles ]

>> Time to party.

[ Creaking ]

[ Loud thud, creaking ]

>> [ Coughs ]

Oh...My g--

so this is party central, huh?

>> This is it!

>> Oh.

You sure do know how to pick

'em, Louisa.

>> Fuck you.

>> I don't know about you guys.

I think a little bit of a smoke

is in order.

Who's coming with me?

>> Are you kidding?!

Baby, this place is fucking

spooky.

>> Geez, leticia!

We've been here for five

seconds!

You're already complaining!

>> If you wanna, I'll give you

guys a little tour.

>> Cool.

What about the wonderbread twins

there?

>> Why not?

>> Troy, guess that leaves you

here to watch our stuff.

>> You kidding me?

I'm not fucking staying here by

myself!

>> What's the matter?

You scared? Scared?

>> Oooooooh!

>> You scared? You scared?

>> Just give me the flashlight.

>> All right, guys. Come on.

Let's go. Follow me.

>> Come on, baby.

>> Let's go.

[ Crickets chirping ]

>> What'd you say this place

used to be?

>> I'm not sure.

I-it's...Been boarded up for a

while.

>> Oh, shit! Damn it!

>> What's up, girl?

>> I stepped in something.

>> Watch where you walk.

There's all sorts of broken

glass and shit in here.

>><i>Nowyou tell me.</i>

>> It's too late now, girl.

There's no turning back.

>> You doing okay?

>> Yeah.

Just...Stay close to me, okay?

>> I'm right behind you.

>> Aaahhhhh!

>> Jesus, girl!

>> What?!

>> Why?!

>> What's up?!

>> I just walked into a

spider web.

>> Jesus!

I wouldn't be surprised.

There's spider webs all over

this place.

>> Hey, Louisa, any other

surprises?

>> We'll see.

[ Creaking ]

>> Shit.

[ Clatter ]

>> Looks like some kind of a

storage room.

>> Yeah.

People have been dumping their

junk here for years.

Once in a while, you'll find a

bum camped out.

>> Let's just hope we don't run

into anybody tonight.

>> Yeah.

'Cause this is a private party.

[ Laughs ]

>> Troy, what are you doing?

>> Just looking around.

>> Well, there's not much to see

in here.

>> Seriously, is the whole place

like this?

>> No. There's other rooms.

>> Let's check 'em out.

>> Yeah.

>> But this is getting old real

fast.

>> Yeah.

>> Come on, guys. Follow me.

>> Jesus.

[ Glass clinking ]

>> Hey! Wait up!

[ Thud ]

>> It's so dark in here.

It's like these hallways go on

forever.

Seems like it'd be easy to get

lost.

>> Stick with me.

You'll be fine.

>> Now, how big is this place?

>> Don't know.

I mean, I really never explored

this building.

>> Well, I think we've seen

enough.

I think we should head back.

>> Come on, man.

Where's your sense of adventure?

We gotta check out some more

rooms.

Hey, Louisa!

We need something big.

You know, somewhere we can set

up our shit.

>> I hear you.

I think there's...A lounge down

this way.

>> A lounge?

>> Yeah, a lounge.

You know -- a big room with old

sofas and a TV.

I guess it was something like

a...A workers' lounge or

something.

>> Sounds good to me.

Let's roll.

>> I-I think it's down this way.

Follow me.

Shit.

>> What?

>> Must be further down the

hall.

>> This ain't no...Lounge.

This is more like an office.

>> Yeah.

Oh, well. Let's get out of here.

>> No, wait. This is cool.

>> Don't worry.

Take your time.

We'll catch you later.

>> Dude, put that shit away.

Come on. Let's go.

>> Oh, God.

Francis, what are you doing?

>> Making myself more

comfortable.

>> Be careful.

>> Don't worry.

Everything's under control here.

>> "Dyson chemical."

>> Say what?

[ Thud ]

>> [ Laughs ]

[ Laughter ]

>> Hey.

Since I'm up, guys, let's get

out of here.

This place is crazy.

That's some bullshit.

>> Are you okay?

>> Yeah.

[ Papers crinkle ]

Shit.

Some light would be great, man.

>> Yeah.

>> I think...I can take care of

hey, Troy.

Give me your flashlight.

>> What are you doing?

>> Look, I'm gonna go find the

breaker box, all right?

I'm sure there's...Gotta be one

around here somewhere.

>> Derek, don't!

Just...

>> Don't worry, rach.

Look, I'll be --

>> don't say it, man!

>> Baby!

>> Don't worry.

I'll be right back.

[ Light laughter ]

>> Derek!

[ Sighs ]

[ Crickets chirping ]

[ Thud, creaking ]

[ Scraping ]

[ Scraping ]

>> Fuck!

[ Crash ]

>> What's taking him so long?

[ Sighs ]

>> Who knows?

Maybe he chickened out and went

home.

[ Laughs ]

>> I knew I shouldn't have

invited him.

>> Hey, come on, you guys.

He could be hurt.

We should go look for him.

>> Go ahead.

You know, maybe that's what he

wants you to do.

>> What are you talking about?

>> [ Chuckling ] Come on,

Rachel.

You know the only reason why

Derek came here is 'cause he

wants to fuck you.

>> Thanks, Louisa.

>> Hey.

I-I'm just trying to look out

for you.

Maybe someday you'll appreciate

>> tonight, I'll look out for

myself, all right?!

>> Chill out, girls!

>> God!

>> This ain't supposed to be no

catfight.

This is a party.

What happened?

>> Well, hell, there's an

electric room right down the

hallway, but there ain't no

juice going to it.

>> Derek, what happened to your

head?

>> Oh, it's all right.

You know, I just dropped my

flashlight and hit a table.

>> I told you, man.

You gotta be careful 'round

here.

>> Well, hell, if it wasn't for

your stupid noises...

>> What noises?

>> Oh, come on, Francis.

Man, you know exactly what I'm

talking about.

I heard you trying to spook me

in the hallway.

>> I've been here the whole

time!

>> Yeah!

>> Yeah. Sure.

>> No, he's telling the truth.

None of us have left this room.

>> Look, enough of this spooky

shit.

Look, y'all, we got music, and

we got beer.

So let's party.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Whoo! Sounds like a plan!

[ Click ]

[<i>Dance music plays]</i>

>> Whoo-hoo!

>> That's my girl!

Go ahead and put it on me, girl.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Heads up!

>> It's okay.

>> Come on, Rachel.

>> Her parents want her to stay

clean, sober, and a virgin.

>> Oh, leave her alone, Louisa.

Geez.

>> More for me.

[<i>Dance music continues]</i>

[ Bottle opens ]

[ Snapping ]

>> Come on.

>> Mmm.

>> Oh!

[ Laughter ]

>> You want to?

>> Do you feel okay?

>> I'm fine. Come on.

>> Are you sure?

>> Yeah. Absolutely.

>> Okay. [ Chuckles ]

[ Snapping continues ]

>> Whoo!

>> Don't...Even...Think about

>> [ groans ]

[ Lighter clicks ]

Want one?

>> We can share.

>> You guys getting busy over

there or what?

[ Chuckles ]

>> Fuck you, Francis.

>> Got to hand it to you,

Louisa.

This place is not bad.

>> Yeah.

How'd you say you found this

place?

>> I don't know.

Just stumbled into it one day.

Just thought it'd be a cool

place to hang out.

>> When was that?

>> Why are you so interested?

>> Don't worry about it.

He's just trying to have a

little conversation.

You know, get things going.

>> Don't even bother, Troy.

She's not into guys.

[ Laughter ]

>> No, no, no.

No, I'm asking 'cause I think I

know where we are.

>> Yeah, me, too.

Some broken-down old factory.

>> Yeah, a factory.

Factory on the edge of town.

I thought it sounded familiar

when you mentioned it before,

Louisa.

[ Boom box clicks, music stops ]

But then whenever I saw the

paperwork in that office, I was

sure.

>> Sure about what?

>> The paperwork all said "Dyson

chemical."

Sound familiar?

>> Wait. Dyson?

[ Papers crinkle ]

Wait. Yeah.

It -- they had a factory around

here.

They had...Like, some kind of

accident there -- a radiation

spill or something.

>> This is it, guys.

>> Okay. Wait. Hold on a second.

Do you mean to tell me that we

are sitting in the middle of a

toxic waste dump right now?

>> Worse.

People were murdered here.

>> Murdered?!

>> What?

>> Louisa!

Did you know about this shit?

>> [ Scoffs ]

First time I'm hearing it.

>> About 15 years ago, Dyson

used to own this building.

They were manufacturing

experimental drugs.

They told the public it was

pharmaceuticals, but they were

actually developing biological

weapons -- real top-secret

stuff.

One of the workers got

contaminated and got so sick she

had to quit.

Dyson denied responsibility, of

course.

It was a terrible scandal.

But not as terrible as what

happened next.

A few days after the scandal

hit, somebody or something

walked right into Dyson chemical

and killed everybody there.

We're talking mass murder here.

24 people, all brutally

butchered.

And they never found the killer.

The police for weeks tried to

find some kind of evidence, but

all they found were blood and

bodies.

And their only possible suspect

was the worker who had been

contaminated, but she had a

solid alibi.

>> What was that?

>> She was dead.

She died a few days before the

massacre, apparently of some

strange disease.

So the case was closed, Dyson

left town, and the factory was

sealed shut.

Never opened again.

>> Wait a second.

I never heard about any

killings.

It was just a...Chemical spill

or something.

>> That's what they told the

public.

They paid the press off pretty

good not to release the truth.

>> Then how come you know all

about it?

>> My friend's Uncle was one of

the cops at the crime scene.

He said it was like hell on

earth.

>> All right, Troy.

Tha-- [ Chuckles ]

That's enough, man.

>> But it's true.

>> You're just trying to scare

that's what I think.

>> Yeah. Seriously.

And you know what?

You're doing a pretty damn good

job, too.

>> Don't worry about that, baby.

>> Troy's just trying to creep

us out.

>> Guys, I'm not making this up.

You can check the papers if you

don't believe me.

Ever since this factory shut

down, there have been all kinds

of accidental deaths and

disappearances around here.

>> So, what, you're saying that

this building is...Haunted?

>> Not haunted.

The killer could still be alive.

>> All right. All right.

All right.

Enough of this spooky-ass ghost

story shit.

>> Yeah.

>> Come on, baby.

We'll see y'all later.

>> Yeah. Let's go.

Bye!

>> Hey, maybe we should go find

a place for ourselves.

>> I-I think I'd rather stay

here, Derek.

I mean...This place is kind of

scary, you know?

>> Don't tell me you actually

believe that story?

>> Never know.

>> Well... [ sighs ]

Look, how about this?

Why don't we go take a tour of

this place?

Come on. Just you and me.

>> Derek, I don't know.

>> Come on, Rachel.

You actually think I'm gonna let

anything happen to you?

Come on.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Okay.

Let's go.

>> Have fun, kids.

[ Groans ]

Nothing else to do but get

wasted now.

Oh, shit!

We're fucking dry, man!

>> Any requests?

>> Why?

You gonna go do a beer run?

>> Maybe.

>> You know, I might as well

leave, too, and maybe I won't

come back.

This fucking party was over

before it even started.

>> Do you want anything or not?

>> Sure.

Get some smokes, too!

[ Both laughing ]

>> Okay, I know what you're

thinking right now, and the

answer is "no fucking way."

>> Come on, baby.

A bed is a bed, right?

[ Chuckles ]

>> Forget it, Francis.

Mnh-mnh.

>> Hey.

It's still got spring.

[ Chuckles ]

Besides...[ Chuckles ]

It beats the floor.

>> Somebody probably died in

that bed.

>> What's the matter?

Troy still got you spooked?

>> All right.

Maybe we should just go, okay?

>> Hey, hey, hey.

Wait, baby.

>> What?

>> This is Francis you talking

you know Francis ain't gonna let

nothin' happen to you.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Both laugh ]

>> Oh! Oh!

>> [ Moans ]

[ Moaning ]

[ Both moaning ]

>> I've been waiting all night

to be alone with you.

>> Me too.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Aah!

>> Did you hear that?

>> Oh.

>> Yeah.

Come here.

>> Aah!

[ Woman laughs ]

[ Woman moaning ]

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> What?

Shh! Shh!

[ Moaning continues ]

[ Door creaking ]

>> I wonder if it's true?

>> What?

>> Troy's story.

>> Come on, rach.

It's Troy.

Nah, he gets off on that kind of

thing.

>> Yeah.

>> I don't know.

You want to keep exploring?

>> No [Chuckles] actually, I

was...I was thinking we would

stay here.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Okay.

Sounds...Good.

>> Mm.

[ Chuckles ]

>> Wh-what's wrong?

>> [ Chuckles ]

Nothing.

[ Chuckles ]

I just...Don't want to rush

things right now...You know?

>> All right.

That's...That's fine.

We don't have to rush into it.

>> Really?

>> Yeah.

>> Let's play a game.

>> S-sure.

[ Both laugh ]

What do you got in mind?

>> Uh, come here.

You sit here.

And I sit here.

>> All right, and then what do

we do?

>> Then...We ask questions.

>> What kind of questions?

>> Anything you want.

>> All right.

Well, who's first?

I guess it's your turn.

[ Both laugh ]

Rachel?

>> I'm thinking.

[ Chuckles ]

Hold on.

Okay.

When was the first time you saw

[ chuckles ]

>> First semester.

You were sitting in front of me

in English class.

You were in Skinner's class?

>> You were, uh, always talking

with Louisa.

>> Oh, yeah.

>> Yep.

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> I promised myself that one

day I'd go out with you.

>> Why didn't you say anything?

>> I don't know.

Too shy, I guess.

>> Yeah, right.

I see -- Derek Redding shy.

>> Yeah...

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> ...go ahead and laugh.

>> [ Laughing ] I'm not.

I think it's cute.

[ Chuckles ]

Okay.

Your turn.

Ask me something.

>> I'm hearing things, man.

[ Click ]

Shit!

[ Squeals ]

[ Thud ]

Whoa!

>> God!

[ Laughs ]

That was fast.

Did you get my smokes?

>> I just saw -- oh, my God.

>> You didn't get my smokes, did

you?

>> There's a guy -- a dead guy!

>> Come on. Give it a rest.

>> I'm serious, Louisa.

I just saw him.

Somebody killed him, and then he

tried to kill me.

[ Thudding ]

>> Listen, if you're trying to

scare me, it ain't working.

I'm not Rachel or leticia.

>> If I show you, will you

believe me?

>> All right.

Troy...Come in here.

Very funny.

>> No. No.

I'm telling you, he was right

here in this chair.

>> Maybe he got up and walked

away.

>> No, but he was right here!

I'm not making this up.

You gotta believe me, Louisa.

Louisa?

Aw, shit.

>> Wah!

Ha ha ha ha ha!

>> God damn it, Louisa!

>> Gotcha!

Aw, I thought you like scary

shit, man.

>> Man, you guys can do whatever

you want.

I'm getting the fuck out of

here.

>> Troy.

Troy, I was just kidding.

Oh, fuck.

There go my fucking smokes.

>> How the fuck do I get out of

this place?

Aah!

Aaahhh! Aahh!

[ Coughs ]

[ Groaning ]

[ Groaning stops ]

>> [ Coughs ]

[ Sighs ]

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> [ Chuckles ]

>> You good.

>> Yeah.

But you're even better.

[ Chuckles ]

>> [ Clears throat ]

>> Where<i>yougoing?</i>

You know, nature calls.

>> You know where the John is in

this place?

>> As far as I'm concerned, this

whole place<i>isa John.</i>

[ Both laugh ]

>> Get out of here.

>> You need anything?

>> Um...Yeah.

Yeah, sure.

How 'bout a beer?

>> Okay. You got it.

If there's anything left.

>> There better be.

Shoot.

Oh! And, Francis...

Don't be gone too long, okay?

>> Don't you worry, baby.

I'll be right back.

>> [ Chuckles ]

Mm.

[ Man screams in distance ]

>> Francis?

Francis, is that you?

>> Did you hear that?

>> Yeah, it's probably just

Francis and leticia.

>> N-- I don't know, Derek.

It sounded like screaming,

like --

>> like I said -- Francis and

leticia.

[ Both laugh ]

Do you want me to check it out?

>> Unh-unh.

I want you to stay right here

with me.

>> Francis?

Francis?

Francis? Come on.

Where are you?

Aah!

Aaahhhh!

>> It's Francis!

>> Aaahhhhh!

>> It's Francis! It's Francis!

Shit. Wh--

[ smack ]

Shit.

>> You scared the shit out of

you didn't have to do that!

Go, go, go and get me my beer,

and don't be playing any more

tricks on me, all right?

And next time, I'm gonna hit you

where it hurts, okay?

>> Shit!

Girl, you must be crazy!

>> Oh, shit.

[ Rumbling ]

[ Gasps ]

Aah! Jesus, Francis!

Oh, God.

>> Jesus Christ, girl, what's

the rush?

>> Where's everybody?

>> I don't know.

Leticia and me -- is there

any more beer?

>> [ Sighs ]

We're -- something happened to

Troy.

>> You trippin' or what?

>> No, I'm serious.

I found his jacket covered in

blood.

>> What?

>> Look!

[ Breathing heavily ]

What?

I just got it out.

You know, just in case --

>> it's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.

Just chill out with the knife

already.

>> Where's leticia?

>> She's down the hall.

>> You left her alone?

>> Francis?

Francis?

You know, you better have that

beer or you're in trouble.

Oh, okay, I get it.

So you want me to come out

there, right, so you can scare

me again?

Unh-unh.

I'm staying right here, okay?

If you want me, you can come and

get me.

>> Leticia?

I know we go...

Leticia?

[ Thudding ]

>> Oh, okay.

Real cute, Francis.

I mean, I ask you for a beer and

you bring her back?

God, you know, I told you I

don't do threesomes!

>> Well, forget about that.

Troy may have been...

We think something may have

happened to him.

>> What?

>> Listen, I found his jacket,

and there was blood on it.

>> All right.

Okay, if this is another one of

your jokes, Francis...

>> No.

>> It's true, baby.

I-I saw it.

>> Jesus.

I -- now what are we gonna do?

>> Well, the first thing we need

to do is find the others.

Do you know where Derek and

Rachel went?

>> No, I mean, we've been here

the whole time.

>> Okay, well, let's start

looking, then.

Come on.

The sooner we get everybody

together, the sooner we can get

out of here.

>> Let's go.

>> No.

I said "no."

>> Man, I don't -- you know

what, I don't get it.

I thought you wanted to.

>> Look...Wanting to make out

with you isn't the same as

wanting to have sex.

>> Look, I'm sorry, okay?

I didn't know that --

>> look, it's okay.

Let's -- let's just not rush

things.

>> Fine.

>> Hey.

>> Oh, thank God.

You guys!

We've been looking all over for

you.

>> Louisa, what the hell are you

doing here?

Geez, we can't have a moment

together without you --

>> shut the fuck up, Derek.

Something happened to Troy.

We have to find him.

>> Well, wait a second.

How do you know?

>> [ Breathing heavily ]

I'll tell you on the way.

Let's go.

>> You think he's dead?

>> I don't know for sure, but

his jacket was full of blood.

>> Oh, my God.

Troy was right.

>> About what?

>> The killer.

Th-th-the guy who killed all

those people years ago.

You guys, he's still alive, and

he's still after us --

>> look, calm down, Rachel.

Look at this.

This is exactly what Troy wants

us to think.

I mean, Jesus, if the guy could

see us now, he would probably be

laughing his ass off.

[ Women scream ]

>> Shit!

Shit!

>> Oh, God!

>> Don't! Don't look!

Don't look! Don't look!

>> Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

Who could have done this?

>> Who cares who did this?

Now what are we gonna do?

>> We're getting out of here

right now.

Louisa, you know this place.

Where's the exit?

>> I don't know about an exit,

but I'm sure we can find our way

back to the front entrance.

>> Well, whatever. Whatever.

Let's just move.

Which way is it?

This way. Come on.

>> Are you sure?

>> Yes. Come on. Believe me.

This is it, guys.

>> Let's go!

>> Go, go, go, go!

>> Shit!

Locked!

What are you talking about

"locked"?

>> Get out of the way.

[ Door banging ]

Shit! We're fucked!

That's not working, Francis.

We're locked in!

>> Well, we got to find another

way out.

>> I don't know of any other --

>> well, we have to look for it.

Francis, you and I need to try

and find another place to get

out of here.

>> What about us?

>> Louisa, look, just stay here

and take care of the girls.

>> What?!

>> No!

No, Francis, you -- no, you are

not going!

>> Babe, we got to find a way

out of here.

>> But I want to be with you,

baby.

>> Derek's right.

You got to stay here.

>> I don't want to.

I don't want to stay here alone.

Please?

>> Look, I'll be back, okay?

>> Don't leave me.

>> Be careful.

>> Francis.

Francis, come on. Let's go.

Come on, Francis!

>> Where the fuck are we?

>> Beats the hell out of me.

Man, there's got to be a window

around here somewhere.

Maybe we can crawl out.

>> I don't see no windows.

>> Well, there's got to be

another way out of here.

>> What's this?

[ Door creaking ]

Man, check this out.

>> Oh, shit.

Dude, maybe we should split up.

>> No, I don't know about that.

>> Listen, you go down this way,

and I'll go down here.

One of us is bound to find

something.

>> [ Chuckles ]

If you don't get killed first.

>> Listen, if you find

something, just call me, all

right?

Either way, be back here in

five.

If anything happens, just yell.

>> Don't worry. I will.

>> Let me out of here, you

mother...Fucker!

Aah!

>> Stop it!

>> I can't.

I fucking -- I can't take this

anymore!

I just can't take it!

You're making too much noise,

okay?

>> I don't care.

Anyhow, it's your fault we came

out here in the --

>> stop it!

Both of you!

Look, if we don't stick

together, none of are gonna make

it out of here.

[ Door creaking ]

>> Nothing in here.

What the fuck?

[ Flesh tearing ]

Aah!

>> Francis!

>> Aaaaaaah!

Come on, bitch!

Come on!

I got something for you.

Come on!

Come on!

Aaahhhhh!

Aaahhhhh!

Aaaahhhh! Aaaahh!

[ Flesh tearing ]

[ Screaming stops ]

>> Open the fucking door!

Francis!

[ Grunting ]

[ Blood squirts ]

[ Grunting ]

Francis!

>> [ Hisses ]

[ Snarling ]

>> God, where are they?

>> Sit down, leticia.

>> No, you know what?

W-we can't just stand around

here, guys.

>> Look, it's all we can do

right now.

>> God, I wish they'd come back.

>> They will.

Look, we just have to wait.

>> I can't -- I just, you know,

I can't wait.

I can't wait anymore.

>> You've got to calm down.

>> Don't tell me to calm down,

Louisa, all right?

That is my boyfriend out there.

>> Derek.

>> What happened, Derek?

>> Where's Francis?

>> He's...Dead.

>> What?

>> What?

>> No.

>> It killed him.

>> No.

That is not true.

>> Look, I'm sorry.

>> You're lying!

You're lying!!

You're lying!

He's not -- he's...

>> Who killed him, Derek?

Did you see them?

>> Yeah, I saw it.

>> "It"? What do you mean "it"?

>> I don't know.

You know what?

It wasn't human, Louisa.

I don't know what it was.

It was just some kind of -- I

don't know -- a monster.

I don't know.

>> Come on.

You really expect me to believe

that?

>> Oh, come on!

I saw it rip his head off, all

right?

It was fucking eating him!

>> [ Sobbing ] Oh, my God.

>> What are we gonna do now?

>> We can't stay here.

That's for sure.

>> Why not?

>> Because if that thing shows

up, we'll be trapped!

>> Okay, so where do we go?

>> Okay, I-I've been thinking

that there's got to be another

way out of this place.

>> How?

>> The basement.

>> Basement?

I didn't hear anything about a

basement.

>> I've only been there once and

supposedly, there's some tunnels

in there that lead outside.

>> Aw, shit! You know what?

I really wish you would have

thought of this sooner, huh?

>> Well, I've never actually

been in the tunnels, but I knew

some kids that told me about it.

>> [ Crying ]

>> D-do you know how to get in?

>> The only way in is on the

other side of the building.

>> All right.

Look, let's do it, okay?

But, look, we have to stay close

together.

Derek, if we're gonna go out

there, we -- we got to be

prepared.

[ Clattering ]

Here.

Let's do it.

Here it is, guys.

>> I can't take this anymore.

I can't.

>> Look, calm down.

>> We're not gonna get out of

here --

>> calm down!

>> It's locked.

>> Again?

>> Aah!

Give me that crowbar.

>> Come on!

>> Come on!

Come on! Let's go!

>> Oh, shit.

[ Thudding ]

Come on! Hurry up!

>> Aaahhh!

>> All right, get behind me,

Rachel!

>> [ Hisses ]

[ Crowbar clanks ]

>> Aah!

>> [ Hisses ]

>> Oh! Oh, my God!

Aaahhhh!

[ Banging ]

[ Screaming stops ]

>> Aah!

>> Are you all right?

>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm all right. Go! Go!

Oh, my God!

>> Aah!

>> Oh, my God!

>> What the hell is going on

here?

>> They must have been here

before us.

>> Hey, where are those tunnels?

>> This way.

>> Come on!

>> Come on.

Come on. Come on. Come on!

>> Aah.

>> [ Snarling ]

>> Oh, shit.

>> What?!

>> It's under all this crap.

>> You've got to be kidding me.

>> Does it look like I'm

kidding?!

[ Thud ]

>> Aaaah!

>> Are you sure it's behind

here?

>> I'm pretty sure.

>> Fuck!

All right, just start moving

this shit!

[ Clattering ]

Look at this shit!

>> Go!

>> [ Grunts ]

>> Back there!

>> [ Grunts ]

>> [ Hisses and snarls ]

>> You guys, stop!

>> What?

>> Did you hear that?

[ Thudding ]

It's coming.

[ Stairs creaking ]

>> [ Hisses ]

>> What are you doing?!

>> I have to stop it.

>> Derek, don't!

That thing will kill you.

>> I have to try.

>> No.

>> Look, somebody's got to make

it out of here.

Promise me you'll make it.

Promise me.

>> I-I will.

No! Derek!

[ Crying ]

I can't.

>> We have to get out of here.

Now, help me.

[ Floorboards creaking ]

>> [ Snarling ]

>> [ Grunts ]

>> What?

I thought you said there's a

tunnel here?

>> There is.

At least, I thought there was.

>> Louisa.

[ Clank ]

Louisa.

>> What?

>> There is no tunnel.

>> What are you talking about?

>> Derek?!

No!

>> Aaaahhhhh!

>> Derek!

[ Flesh tears ]

>> [ Groans ]

[ Gasps ]

>> Aah!

Aaaah!

Aah!

>> [ Grunts ]

[ Smack ]

Aah! No! No!

[ Groaning ]

Aah!

>> Aah.

[ Groans ]

>> Oh, my God. Derek?!

Derek?!!

Derek, get up!

No! Oh, my God!

Aaaaah! Aaaaaaah!

Aah!

>> Going somewhere, Rachel?

>> Louisa.

>> [ Hisses and snarls ]

>> What are you doing?

>> Nowhere to go now.

>> Get out of my way!

Your crazy lunatic's gonna kill

us both!

>> No, she won't.

Will you, Alexa?

>> [ Hisses ]

>> She'll do whatever I say.

After all, I take care of her.

>> Take care of her?

What the hell is that thing?

Alexa's not a thing.

She's a person, just like you

and I.

>> It's not human.

>> [ Hisses ]

>> I mean, it's gonna kill us

both.

>> Alexa's my sister, Rachel!

That's my sister!

>> You're crazy!

Your sister died when you were

[ crying ] I remember.

>> That's just what we told

everybody.

>> [ Hisses ]

>> No, Alexa, stay back.

>> [ Snarls ]

>> Troy's story was true.

Dyson owned this building, and

Alexa worked for them as a

researched.

One day, she got exposed to

hazardous chemicals.

After that, she got more and

more sick.

At first, her mind went.

But then, after awhile, we

couldn't recognize her, either.

And we kept her at home as long

as we could.

And we tried to keep he sickness

a secret.

>> [ Snarling ]

>> But she got away.

We found her covered with blood,

and we knew what had happened.

And when the police showed up,

there was only one thing we

could do...

We told them she was dead.

She's lived here ever since.

>> How could you?

>> [ Hisses ]

>> Louisa, she killed all those

people!

>> It's not her fault she's like

this.

She didn't want to hurt anybody.

>> No!

>> They did this to her, Rachel!

All I can do now is try to keep

her alive while she gets better.

>> Better?

Louisa, she's not human.

She's not human!

>> I have to help her.

She needs blood to survive.

She needs human blood.

She'll die without it, Rachel.

>> [ Hisses ]

>> No, Alexa.

No! Stay back!

>> That's why you brought us

here?

You brought us here 'cause you

knew she was gonna kill all of

us and she was gonna take our

blood and...

>> It was perfect.

[ Laughs ]

Usually, nobody comes because

this place is so isolated.

And you guys wanted to party.

>> So now you're gonna kill me,

huh, Louisa?

>> She's my sister.

I'll do anything for her.

>> [ Hisses ]

>> Aah! No!

>> Get back, Alexa.

Stay back.

Stay back!

No! Not ye--

aah!

Ah! You bitch!

Stay back!

Stay back!

Stay back!!

Alexa, it's me -- Louisa!

>> [ Crying ] No!

>> [ Grunting ]

Aaahhhh!

>> Aah!

Aaah! Aaah!

No!

Aaaaaaaaah!

[ Birds chirping ]

[ Muffled scream ]

[ Gasps ]

>> How you feeling, Rachel?

Where am I?

>> You're at St. Joseph's

hospital.

You've been here for five days

now.

>> But...How did I get here?

>> You don't remember?

>> Last thing I remember...

I was...

I was running.

I was running, and I was trying

to get out of the factory.

>> They found you on a road,

near the old Dyson chemical

plant.

You were unconscious.

For a while there, we weren't

sure that you were gonna make

Rachel, this is

detective terrell.

He'd like to ask you a few

questions.

>> Hi, Rachel.

Glad you're back with us.

>> Did you, uh...Did you go to

the factory?

>> Yeah, we've been there.

>> My friends -- all my friends.

She killed them all.

>> Well, we found several

bodies, uh, but we haven't

identified all of them yet.

>> B-but wh-what about -- what

about Alexa?

>> Who?

>> Alex-- she's the one who

killed all those people.

She's a -- a monster.

>> Uh, maybe she needs some more

rest.

>> Yeah.

>> No, no, look, she -- she has

these long...Metal teeth,

like -- like -- like fangs.

A-a-and she had these long,

metal fingernails.

Look, she wasn't even human.

>> It's okay, Rachel.

Um...

Why don't you get some sleep,

and, uh, we'll talk more later.

>> Look, she's been living there

for years.

>> Don't worry about it, Rachel.

We're gonna find out who did

this.

>> But I know.

Wait.

How many bodies did you find?

>> Eight.

>> Rachel, I'm gonna step

outside.

If you need anything, just call

me.

>> "Eight"?

>> Aaahhhh!

>> Troy.

>> Aaahhhhh!

>> Francis.

>> Aaahhhhh! Aaahh!

Aaahhhhh!

>> Leticia.

>> [ Gasps ]

>> Derek.

>> Aaahhhh!

Aaahhhh! Aaah! Aaah!

>> Louisa.

Eight.

But...What about...?

She's still alive.
