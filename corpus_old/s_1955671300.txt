Good Morning.
Good morning teacher.

Bushido.

The Path of the Samurai.

His honor was the
guide of their lives.

A Samurai knew...

that his final test
related to death.

Face to face with death...

intrepid and unwavering...

who does not seek death...

but the acceptance...

was carrying...

samurai life.

Nice, man.

Stuart?

He is Professor Vent.

It's so beautiful here.
And everyone is so cool.

Brazilians are cool people.
When's your speech?

Ten hours. Then I visit the children's
hospital in Rio de Janeiro.

Secret Service.
This is invasion.

Hey, no one can be here.

Like the mother?

Well, they still Room
Lincoln reorganization.

Why did she never go?

They wanted a married doctor.

You can not be here.

I do not speak English...

In position. Let's go further.

To the beach?

Honey, do you know
what beach wear is?

I love you too.

What is?

I'll be right there.

Terrorists are called
People's Liberation.

They demand a hundred million dollars...

and modern weapons the
government subversive activity.

I do not care what they demand.

They already have six people murdered...

This government does not
deal with terrorists.

But... have your wife...

I'm aware of that. Thank you.

When?
Yeah.

I hope your husband understands...

that we are prepared
to die for our sake.

How very tragic.

But if you think you and my husband
your gang gear weapons will do...

forget it.

If not, get it.

About five minutes to
the destination, sir.

Good luck.

Check the terrace!

If I hear any more
shot, you're dead.

Who are you?
Room service.

I do not know who you are, but you
did not even introduce yourself.

Oh my God... You're hurt!

Can you swim, my lady?
Yes, why?

What are you doing?

Put your arms around my neck.

Are not we going down there?

It's just an attraction in Disneyland.
Promise?

Hug me around the
neck and hold tight.

Is your husband very jealous?

Nice to meet you, Mrs.

Thank you

The man who saved me, Who is he?

Ma'am, we have no idea.

Where are you going?

Visit the George.

Can I come, too?
Not this time.

Are you okay?
Yes. See you soon.

Hello Nevada.
How you doing, boy?

What a surprise!
Hello Joshua.

How you doing, George?
Happy to see you.

"You've had a job here."
"We've been painting, that's all.

Come in for coffee.

I've heard about the case
with the First Lady.

It reminds me of the time
I started in Burma and...

Listen, I know you're not in
order to retrieve memories.

But tell me. What's up?

How did you know
the time, George?

It's a feeling inside,
you know that.

Is it your time?

I think so.

Then you will see a
successor to find.

Just as I was you.

Hear!

According to sources here and the U.S.
the Santiago responsible cartel...

about 40 percent of illicit
drugs enter the U.S.

Excuse me, sir?
Sergeant?

We have nothing against
action, but as we know...

why throw things other than
just flat from the air?

The cartel has a primary
school in the complex.

A school?

There is a teacher and
about twenty students.

What? Cum...
Your mission is complex...

destruction and an acceptable number
of civilian losses to maintain.

An acceptable civilian
number to lose?

Lieutenant, can you
explain what this is?

Five children? Six?
That's enough, Sergeant!

But you remember that your main
neutralization of the installation.

Apple.

One red apple.

Red apple.

Two red apples.

Very good.

For the love of God.

You had to believe God thank
you for insulting me.

No sir...
Not Santiago...

Should I kill him?
"No, I have more balls."

The helicopter will be exactly
in an hour ago. One hour!

I'll wait with you.
Okay, she's done!

Forward!

You're ready to go.
OK, let's go.

It's about three clicks
from here to the place.

That gives us fifteen
minutes to the floor...

thirty minutes to the mission
and fifteen to return.

More questions?

I have a question.
Will you marry me?

Unfortunately, Burroughs, I
Dobson has already promised.

Well. Now, remember...
Together, together at home.

Stressed, men!

Do you speak English?
Yes.

Listen, I want you kids
away from the situation.

What are you going to do?
Take the children to safety.

Am I releasing you?

I suppose so.

Ready to go?
Yes, let's start.

Come on, blow it up!

Do it!

Let's hit it!

Where are Burroughs and Dobson?
"They were behind us.

What is?
"There are two men behind."

Let's go.

I can not wait any longer.
I have an enemy troop report.

No, we stay!

Climb!
No, he does not have.

I gave you an order, soldier!

I sleep like this in court.
"Then give me enough reason."

Look, Sergeant! There they are!

Cover me!

Come back, Slater!

He's seriously injured, Sergeant.

Hold on, my friend. It's good.

The lieutenant has to see
I also saw some actions.

We understand the circumstances
surrounding the incident...

and our concern to slater
his men to imagine.

The truth is that a
direct command denied it.

And you have a more mobilized
employee mobilization.

Thus, this court has no
choice but to convict...

at least seven years
in a federal facility.

Good shot, Slater.

There he is.

Do you have a cigarette?
"No, sorry, I do not smoke."

Me neither.

Get Slater.
I thought not.

This hole is not.

From now on.

Nice. If you're with him the
grave will be, you can.

Everything is OK?

Ask them.

It's going too far, Slater.
There is no turning back.

On the side.

Smith, Lundgren. Opzouten.

Let me see how hard you are without
your "brother" to support you.

Seriously, this is you.
"Not the one?"

He put it down!

Guard!

He is dead.

Come on.

We're just talking and
he's suddenly turned on.

Next witness.

I just got there in time.

He is the Special Unit.
These guys are murderers.

We may be satisfied that
we are still alive.

The witness must remain.

Not less than thirty years.

I have twelve possible
successors for you.

From this, it is the
most promising.

Deke Slater.

Is he in prison?

Yes, but I have the
charges you studied.

I find it mistakenly hard rated.

He was popular with almost every
major university in the country.

And he had an athletic
or purse to get.

And he was on duty? Fascinating.

Okay. Let him try.

Who are you?
I'm your ticket to freedom.

Open B-409.

What do you mean:
Can not you tell me?

What do not you understand, Mr.
Slater?

Hang on. Wait!

First you take me out of
prison, even autonomous...

which is not only something,
but a bit insulting...

You brought me here tells me that I or
another mysterious man satisfy ga...

and now you say you can
not give me more details.

It's perfectly understandable.

This is him? A teacher?

A teacher.

Is this the man I'm
going to explain?

Who are you?

Tell me, I had enough
as a toy to be used.

I have doubts and
want answers now.

I told you, I...

What do you know?

The right hand of the president?

The function is created at
the time of Abraham Lincoln.

Since then, every president
he can trust someone...

what will happen to.

Oh, whatever? I get it.

Well, within the limits
of reason and morality.

The function is highly confidential.
It exists, but it is little known.

You mean the White House
maintains complete denial?

So now you're the man... Are you on
the right side of the President?

What is?
Would you like to retire, or something?

Something.

How do you know I'm
the right man to do?

I do not know.

Not yet.

Jesus... What is this space?
Our training room.

We have everything we need.

Including my
favorite, "the way".

Or, as I call it, "the curse".

When will we start?
"I'm glad to see you so enthusiastic."

Let's see how long that lasts.

Is she always so sarcastic?
"This is nothing."

This is very beautiful,
but we do it here.

What do you mean by that?
"Come, let me see you."

You got it?
Yes I understand.

If we do it here.

We will try again.

General Tran... Welcome.

Thank you, Mr. Santiago.

Satisfaction is for us.
What about plutonium?

Thank you

It's my pleasure.

You did not have broccoli.

I really do not like broccoli.

I do not care. You eat broccoli.

George Bush does not eat broccoli.

But you're not George Bush.

What does he like?
"Who, George Bush?"

No, President Mathews.
He is a good boy?

I do not know. I never knew him.

I serve as an intermediary
for the president.

If something goes wrong on a mission...

it is so impossible to go
back to the White House.

Just eat your broccoli.

You see, you're not
the one to choose it.

In an ideal situation, a
well-trained superiority fighter...

on the less-trained opponent.

But what less an
ideal situation?

You are tired, hungry, you are
mentally and physically exhausted.

And then?

You have the ability to develop attention
and concentration to maintain.

For every other head to
eradicate the journey.

Your physical condition,
your mental condition...

Your concern for your
safety or even your life.

There is nothing
more than Mission.

This is something that the great
inventors in the computer industry...

invented especially for us.

It gives access to the
universal satellite.

You can communicate directly with
me through a secret technology.

And access to top secret files
from the BVD and the FBI.

More questions?
An. Has no patience?

Listen carefully. This
phone has a global reach.

It is also a radio
controlled ignition system.

You run an access number,
and then your code.

Energy is supplied by a
small nuclear battery.

What is it?

This is full of C-7s. This is the
C-4 similar to a stink bomblet.

Hear 's, this is stupid.
What's stupid?

This one. A practice with that battle.
Sorry but...

Rule one:
Never underestimate your opponent.

Come on, Joshua. She told me
but a step forward, okay?

Rule number one...
Well, I barrel 'm.

If you see this guy... Shoot.

In a fraction of a second...

can decide the average difference
between life and death.

You have to relax and
use your momentum.

The secret is commitment.
You absolutely should go for it.

Try again.
Yeah, just give it a try.

How do you know Joshua?

In fact, I've known
my whole life already

In your file it was just
that you are an orphan.

What happened to your family?

I do not know.

When I had three...

my parents me a church left.

No note. Without explanation.
Anything.

If you want, I can
probably find you.

Maybe later.

How about you?
Where's your family?

Joshua is my family.

Do not. I mean your real family.

Joshua is my real family.
He is my father.

He met my mother at
the end of the war.

They were in love and getting married.
I followed not much later.

What happened to the
mother happened?

She was murdered.

They were deceived by a man
they thought was his friend.

Checkmate.

I really hate this stupid game.

This is only possible
because you are very bad.

I already am.

I would like your insurance.

It must be assured,
Mr President.

Donna? I am ready for the
instructions on Indonesia.

Her name is Courtney Lyons.

The daughter of Senator Bob Lyons?
The only.

Three months ago she was
persuaded to join...

a religious sect adhere.

Three days ago, they got word
to their father of contraband.

She wants out.
"But they will leave you."

Wait, the daughter of a Senator
is arrested against her will...

and you do not just send Marines?

Says "Branch Davidian Composed"
one thing?

I get it.

The sect is called "The Chosen One".

Your leader is a pipsqueak.
Douglas Wetherby.

Washington has the right
to We try to explain?

What right has the "politicians"
contribute to our requirements.

The wolf may be at the
door, we will not let him.

We are a sovereign power,
an unsurpassed nation.

And we will fight to the death
for our right to freedom.

Do you like him very much?

I have a question...

The people you keep
outside or inside?

Both, probably.

There she is.

Job?

The sediment containing a small Creator
from a range of radioactive isotopes.

They think... is to put a

but they must ensure that the
isotope that follows its 24 hours

We'll wait until dark,
so let's go inside.

We?
I think I should do it themselves.

Because?
Because this mission is a breeze.

I go in there, take her out and I back
before someone announces that they are gone.

No mission is a breeze.
And I do not know if you're ready.

There is only one way to
make it discover, right?

There are patrol guards
along the grounds.

So you came here more.

I have never had such clear
recognition images seen.

We download them directly
from the satellite.

What is the satellite?
Eye in the sky.

There are probably no more than a
few centimeters in the earth...

not continuously being photographed.

The microphone is completely wireless.
Chatting is normal. Give me your arm.

Because? What is it?
Radioactive isotope.

The red dot is Courtney Lyons.
Blue is you.

Remember, it's a simple extraction.
You're going back in and out.

But Mr. Wetherby, the domestic
bill against terrorism...

the following week
Congress for approval.

If it is we can pack.

Who supports the project?
Senator Lyons.

Get Courtney Lyons.

It's Senator Lyons time
to send a message.

Come on, Mr. Wetherby
wants to talk to you.

Who are you?
I get everything here.

Not without Cathy.
Come on.

No! I'm not going without her.

She is my best friend.
I can not go out.

Right. Where is she?
On here.

Cathy, come on. We go here.
I stay here.

Who are you?

Wetherby is disturbed.

We have to go.
With or without it.

I'm not leaving.
"I'm not going without her."

Freeze.

I do not know who you are, but
you're just a big mistake.

Who sent you?
No one.

I am a friend of these
girls, and I have them.

You have one with
you, and where to go.

What were you doing?
"She did not want to leave without her."

You had a job.
I know, Joshua.

Excuse.
"I have here on this subject."

You need to talk to him.

He is not the easiest to speak.

Talk to him.

You'll think I screwed up.
It's not not to ruin what you have...

I know you have to ruin it.

I followed my instinct.
"And that's the problem."

It follows that you alone
are your instinct.

Like when you hit the lieutenant.
"I had two men in the field."

And it's not right.
But you had other options.

What options do I have? Tell me.
Think about it.

And what did you get out of
this dead prisional guy?

That was self-defense.
Time followed his instinct for survival.

What would you say?

I wanted to say that you were to other
things can listen to your instincts.

As your mind.

Well, maybe I am
just is not enough.

Maybe not, no.

Deke feels awful.
Good. He led a mission in distress.

What do you do?

I know yet.

Get ready for winter
or do the exercise?

A little of both.

What is wrong?

I get the wrong
selected, George.

Why do you think?

He is so arrogant and
do everything to know.

And you do not think it
was you when you started?

Maybe a little.

Maybe a lot.
But you have already learned.

You have two things
to look into.

When I told you successor
to be found...

I mean you should
create your own.

You're not looking at the
negative side of a man...

you are looking at your positive side.

Secondly, because things do
not like what you would do...

This does not mean it's wrong.

How was your visit?

Was good. Deke, we need to talk.

I'm in my office. No.
It affects all of us.

You screwed up.

I know but...
Let me finish.

You screwed up, but you did
it for the right reasons.

You will make mistakes, but what matters
is how you deal with those mistakes.

So I'm not fired?

So you're not very lucky.

Americans call it
a war on drugs...

but it's a war against us.

They have our
location destroyed...

but never found.

Americans think we can
fight impunity...

that nothing we can do back.

General Tran thanks you
and your plutonium...

they will quickly realize
how deceived they are.

Two rotating giants and
a somersault backwards.

I just did it.

I know. But now
you've got blindfold.

He makes a joke, right?

What do you think?

I mean, let's go.

He's better already.

Best?

Eighteen seconds.

Am I good or am I right?

What do I tell you
about overconfidence?

You know what they say...

This is not a bluff if you can deliver.
It's still bluffing.

Well, this 'talkative'
thinking he can beat him.

Let me see.

You are not honest.

I play to win.
Where do you recommend?

I do not know... The mission...
The bell rings.

What arrested you?

You.

Exactly, sometimes I have
a removal barrier...

to its effect can achieve.

Okay, gentlemen.
Your game is over.

Dr. Francisco Anderson is a
widely renowned physicist...

and the department's main
expert internal security...

in the field of nuclear
weapons tactics.

Dr. Anderson showed
up at work yesterday.

A BVD team was his home.

Dr. Anderson, his wife and
two daughters, were lost.

The FBI and the BVD are
an extensive study...

but to date have not been met.

Do they think the
family was kidnapped?

Yes. And they get everything
from the closet to find them.

The President asked for your help.

Everybody out.

What happens here? Who are you?
Your new employer.

What you want?
Six tactical nuclear weapons.

Our Vietnamese friends will
plutonium, and expertise.

Let's see what
America is worth...

when a bomb exploded
in a New York subway.

Ga I help you...
Yes it is.

Let me clarify this point.

You will help us, because you
Otherwise your whole family dies.

One by one. Slowly and painfully.
Understood?

Chess!

I'll be here in.

Yes, you have the address.

But...

Checkmate.

I hate this game.

But you're better.

They have Dr. Anderson
and his family found.

According to Langley's
latest information...

are in his possession Santiago
drug cartel in Colombia.

The drug on the Santiago cartel?

When I was in Delta Force, they
have destroyed their thirst.

Well, they have a
new construction...

in a remote area of
the Colombian Forest.

Is the location known?

The drug barons control over
25,000 kmÂ² of Columbia.

And there are hundreds on the
country scattered places.

According to sources
Santiago has a business

Vietnamese with a group of former
employees headed by General Vinh Tran.

Vinh Tran?

Do you know him?

Is it?

What did he do?

He is the man my
mother was murdered.

Open!

Plutonium weapons.
How did you receive it?

Your contact in Colombia
Felipe Juarez is a.

He will be here tomorrow afternoon
to gather for four hours.

Why does he help us?

Philip of the family murdered
by the man Santiago.

That's a good reason.

Say that again.

What is this tight.

In a few minutes you
have enough space.

Three minutes into
the drop zone.

The house of our
contact A mile south.

Santiago male.

Goodbye contact.

And now?

This field every fifteen minutes
from air points of view.

That said hundreds of these
drug complexes in t country.

Who is looking for a
needle in a haystack.

I have an idea.

Let's contact.

We have satellite photos as needed.
"Do you have the coordinates?"

5 degrees, 53 minutes north.
75 degrees, 11 minutes West.

I'm looking at satellite access.

Calendar?

Begin at 16:00 am
and ga from there.

These are our boys.
Santiago do knokploeg.

Ga slightly.

Highlight the Jeep and follow
them back to square one.

Stop here. Zoom.

I got you.
What, what are the coordinates?

7 degrees, 16 minutes north.
77 degrees west 2 minutes.

This is in the middle of the
jungle, just outside Medillin.

We will contact as we have
the mission accomplished.

Good luck, boys.

How long?

I do not know. This
material is very old.

I'll give it to you until tomorrow morning.
This is impossible.

With sufficient motivation
nothing is impossible.

You have tomorrow off.

I want to go home!

I know. US too.
When?

Coming soon baby. When the
father has finished his work.

Come on.

Where are you taking us?

Choose one.

What are you talking about?

Choose the person who
will first be killed.

I Do not!

Good. So, I choose you.
No!

It's too valuable to kill.
Attempt.

Maybe you want Dad to talk.

Because if he does
not work anymore...

I will go tomorrow...
you must kill.

The sun is down. How much more?

Ten kilometers to
the camp, this way.

Okay. Forward.

It's time.
I'm almost finishing.

Sorry doctor, but
how you respect...

when my word is not love?

Wait. I give you a bomb, I
just a little more time.

And that you start.

After analyzing his
daughter to have murdered.

You stay with my daughter!
No, Terry!

Mom!

Who made this? Leaves!

Come out, or they will happen!

There he is!

Who are you?

You're going to tell me
what I want to know.

Why do you suffer in the first place?
"That's my nature, I guess."

Let us know when he's
willing to talk.

Good job.

Have all the time been analyzed?
Yes.

Bring the family to safety.
I must do something.

Tran.

Joshua McCord. You're
hard to eradicate.

Why did you do that?

$ 200,000.

The North wanted Vietnamese
You liked death.

Why my wife?

Why read it?
"I could not leave witnesses."

Easy. I hear from you.
Who are you?

I am here for you and
your family for safety.

Stay close and follow me.

Wait. I'll be back.

I have often wondered...

what would happen if
we would meet again.

We'll see.

Come on. We'll get
you somewhere else.

Wolf, where are you waiting?
I have no idea.

It's him?
Yes.

Call.

You're safe now.
Thank you

Good work, Deke.

Thank you.

I had a good teacher.

Let's go for it.

In between.
Mr. President.

We just received notice
from Delta Force.

Dr. Anderson and his family
are safe and on the way home.

Thank God.

What is it?
You file.

It's clean.

What do you mean, "clean"?

That means that everything
can do what you want.

Everything I want?

So what do you want?

I want the right to
be the president's man.

Two minutes to destination, sir.

Good luck, sir.
