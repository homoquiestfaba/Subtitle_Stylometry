What I do requires a certain mindset.

I do assignments.

Designated targets.

Some jobs need to look like accidents,

Others must cast the suspicion
on someone else.

A select few, you need to send
a clear message.

Pulling a trigger is easy.

The best jobs are the ones that nobody
even knows you were there.

A liquor fairy paid me a visit last night.

Left me a big ole bottle of Scotch.
He even sprung for the good stuff.

See you, Henry.

Why the fuck do I let you drag
me out to this shit hole?

You're a snob, Harry. Eleven hundred people
come through here everyday.

Hard to remember two
fellows who pass it thru'.

Thank you.

Of course, people might remember them.

I know that kinda defeats your purpose.

I was an ex-zonal where you work
without a network.

Try to get them suits that fit,
they look like costumes!

Everything went okay?

It got done.

You know I'm better than you, you know?

That's why they give you those jobs
that can get a little hairy because..

If it were to get hairy then
you would take care of it

and that's all they care about.
Service is rendered, no loose ends.

Fait accompli.
You're a goddamn machine.

You see things,
you view people...

Differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

But you got a problem, Arthur.

You need companionship.
I have you, Harry.

Oh, then you're in deeper
shit than I thought.

So, how's Steven?

Did I tell you that I got him
a job in a private security firm?

They kicked him out last month.
Beat some guy half to death.

Goddamn disappointment. Always
has and always will be.

Call him.
Me, call him?

For what?
Yeah, he probably needs to hear from you.

Yeah.

Let's go. We'll get your money.

Come on, dance with me?

Please.

You hungry?

Sure.

I gotta go.

Okay.

Never going to tell me your name?

Arthur.

Nice try. You're no Arthur.

No, more like a David.

Or Brad.

Yeah. See you, Brad.

Global Engineering.
I'm calling about the ad.

There must be a mistake.
One moment, please.

The advertisement was proved.
The information was accurate.

Call a meeting.

We'll get back to you.

Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean has
agreed to a meeting.

A private jet will pick
you up in one hour and

deliver you to a neutral
site of his choosing.

You'll be allowed fifteen minutes.
The jet will then return you.

When we tell you to be home at 10 o'clock,
we mean 10 not 11:30.

I don't care, baby. You
scared your mother to death.

You're grounded for two weeks.

Just one second.

That's not my problem.

Allright look. Ten days and you volunteer
two Saturdays at the shelter.

Eight days and three Saturdays.

Nice ring.
Done.

I don't get one of those.
I don't think you can.

Unless you're a world champion.

Just tell him to come
out and fix it, honey.

Well, let's go.

I've just been out-negotiated
by a sixteen year old.

Let's take a walk.

Six months ago we were
commissioned to undertake

the largest contract
we've ever attempted.

The target was far more high profile than
we're normally comfortable with.

The job was just too rich to pass up.
The target was South African?

The target fled to South Africa.
That's where we made our move in Capetown.

It took six months to set up,

I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

All five were killed.
Someone knew everything.

You probably knew some
of the men on our team.

I knew this one, Sebastian.

You know how this company works, Mr. Bishop.

Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

Two people knew the details here.
Me and Harry McKenna.

Harry sold us out.

We pulled his financials. Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

There's one there made two weeks ago
for twenty million US dollars.

He's gotten old,
he's gotten weak.

He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his caust and troubled son.

That made him vulnerable.

And for the past 13
years, I have been fiercely

loyal to him. There's
no one I respected more.

But Harry McKenna has poisoned the well.
He needs to be removed...

Immediately.
Let me talk to him.

Look, I appreciate your
connection with Harry.

But there's no turning back here.

He has "Crossed his Rubicon".

Everyday he's alive,
puts this company in danger.

You know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

Given your relationship, you're in best

position to get this done
quickly and discretly.

And to be honest with you, I hate the idea
of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

We don't wanna go to my outside source.
But we will if we have to.

Excuse me a sec.

Jess, negotiations are closed, I'm sorry.

I'm in a meeting.
Okay, hang on, son.

Forty eight hours or we'll
proceed without you.

Hey, squared, remember the expression
"Quit while you're ahead"?

Yeah. I mean, Roosevelt to
be truthful is my hero.

I mean, the way he dealt
with this damn chair.

Goldwin, pull your trousers
up, will you, please?

Pull you trousers up?

You know, those suits doesn't really
fit you guys very well.

Yeah?
Get out of the building, Harry.

Arthur?
They're coming for you tonight.

Who, who's coming?
Dean.

Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

Oh, Jesus!

Do you have a pair of scissors?
Yeah.

Go to the elevator lobby.
On my way.

Looks like we got a power
outage on the 18th floor.

You have 15 seconds to
get to the service elevator

before the emergency power comes on.

There's a keypad.
Punch in the building number.

I thought we cut the power off?

Service elevators have to
work on a separate power source.

I'm in.

Press the basement floor.

The elevator will take
18 seconds to get there.

The level is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

It connects to the building next door.
Leads to an underground parking lot.

Shit!

Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

Okay, you should be
entering the parking lot.

My van's here.
I left it there.

Oh, shit.

I hate it. You get me to
circumvent my own security, eh?

Nobody sees me leave.

So what's this?
Cape Town, right?

Yeah. Right.

So what's the story here?

Car jacking?

Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole section of the city,

Stripped, up on blocks.

Something like that.

Oh, a slight editorial revision!

You don't mind, do you?

AMAT VICTORIA CURAM.

Yeah, I get off a couple of shots,
there's a struggle,

They get my gun.
C'est la vie!

At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

I've had that for 33 years.

A gift from Admiral Beasly, sixth fleet.

That's the first time
I ever fired it.

Why didn't you kill me?
No.

They'll just send somebody else.

I would rather it was you, Arthur.

I have to live with it.

Arthur fucking Bishop.
Sorry for your loss.

More of a loss for you
than me, buddy.

It's a long time.

Hey, would you give me a ride to
my father's house?

Your father, talked about you a lot.

Talked about spending time with you?
Maybe make it up.

Give it a rest, will you?

You know, he always bringing you up.

He had regrets, Steven.

Yeah? He could have
picked up the phone anytime.

I want to show you something.

I loved this place as a kid.

It's pretty impressive, huh?

Everyone of them,
served their country.

I guess I could still enlist!

You know, make him proud.

I'm fucking with you!

I don't know if you have a
picture of him, but I thought maybe you..

Want one.

Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around?

For what?
He didn't leave a will.

The accounts are empty.
Banks going to take the house.

By the time of the lawyers,
city and state get through

with the rest, there's not
gonna be a fucking thing left.

Where you headed?
Folk's place.

Need some money?
No, thanks.

I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

I figured that will probably get me
through on the next spot.

What about the guns?

I was thinking about going out and killing
myself a couple of car jackers tonight.

Just any old run of the mill car-jacker.

Yeah, you never know, it might get
lucky, find the guys that kill my dad.

Going to make you feel better?

Fuck if I know.

I will find out.

Save it up, Steve.

Hey Bishop?

What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

Yo?

Hey.
Hey, you need some help?

No, I think I got it.

I was supposed to meet a friend and
I might of gotten the address wrong.

Yeah, maybe.

Well maybe the address got me wrong.

Nice car, man. Nice car.
Thanks.

Can I have it?
What?

I'm releaving you of your automobile,
motherfucker! Out of the car?

Seriously?
Seriously.

Jesus, fuck okay. Okay.

Carjacker?

Did you shoot him with this?

Is this the gun you used?

No?

Hey, bad move.

Probably thought this through,
did you, Steven?

This may not seem like it,
but tonight's your lucky night,

Raymond.

If anybody asks, you fell down.
Because we'll come looking for you.

Get out of here!

Stupid to kill someone
when you have a motive.

Might as well paint a bulls eye
on your back.

I don't give a shit.
Whatever.

Get out of here!

Fuck!

I was thinking about what
were you saying the other night.

And eh... I wanna know what you know.

Go online.
It's all on the Internet.

But I don't wanna read it,
I wanna do it.

Do what exactly?
Bishop, don't bullshit me!

I know about you.
And him.

He was your mentor. He chose
you over me. You owe him.

Now that he's gone, he left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

Go home, Steve.

Still for sale.

You know you want it.
No other lifetime for this.

Want some advice?
Follow what this tells you.

He's trying to tell you something.

He's telling you, you're homesick for
a place you never been.

8600 Elborano Street.
7 A.M tomorrow.

Serac animal shelter, can I help you?

What is this place?
It's an animal shelter.

Yeah, I know what it is. Why are we here?
Look for a dog like this.

Under a year if possible.
I'd taken you more for a cat person.

You know what a Mechanic is,
outside its obvious definition?

A guy who fixes things,
problems, does contracts.

A hitman.
I do assignments.

Designated targets.
I could do that.

I've seen some shit.
No, you haven't.

You know shit about me, Bishop.

Steven Jackson McKenna.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.

Your mother died when you was 12.
Mixture of pain meds and vodka.

You attended 3 different high schools,
Grant, The Park and Munroe.

Elected in four sports.
Got a scholarship from Miami,

that was rescinded upon a conviction of
possession with an attempt to distribute.

Add four misdemeanors
for aggrevated assault and

local threats against
two different girlfriends.

Broke your kneecap in a streetfight.

Didn't wanna tell anyone so
you let a tale on its own.

Now when it rains, you walk with a limp.
I'll show you the X-rays if you like.

A friend here would like
to adopt this little fella.

Good boy.

What I do requires a certain mindset.

Revenge is an emotion
that can get you killed.

So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

Walk it, feel it, make it your best friend.

Tomorrow, eleven, Fisher Square.

Take the dog to the coffee
shop on Riverdale.

Order a coffee.
Black.

Sit at the table by the window, and do the
sudoku puzzle in the paper.

Play it nice with the dog.
For how long?

One hour.

Every day for the next three weeks.

This is yours.

Practice on this.

Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

They even have books with actuaries.

Lists of every cause of death imaginable.

Whyn't you just shoot 'em and fuck all this?

Good judgement comes from experience and
a lot of that comes from bad judgement.

Bed's under the boxes.
Help yourself.

How long you've been working on it?

Two years.
It's nice.

When are we going to go for a ride?
We? Never.

Time to take your training
to the next level.

Who's that?
He's good.

Only checked you out.

I can come back.
Rather than stand out here.

I gotta tell you man.
I'm a little skittish right now.

Not sure if this a good time
for me to be doing anything.

It's a lot of shit wind, you know.

I brought the list and the money.

Now's not a good time?

Let me see the list.

All this by when?
As soon as possible.

All right. Take me a day
to make it happen.

May I have the money?

Auto-erotic asphyxiation?
Yep.

I just thought you should
see one up close.

Don't ever touch this.

Follow me.

Who was he?
A job. Nothing more, nothing less.

Makes you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

Sold weapons to anyone.

Cop killers, gangbangers,
terrorists.

He didn't discriminate.

That's the file.

The guy from the coffee shop?

All yours.

You wouldn't know it by looking at him.
But he's a Mechanic for another group.

His only routine is coffee
every morning from nine to ten.

Doesn't go any place twice,
except here.

He's insulated... protected.

No way in without him seeing us coming.
Except he has two weaknesses.

Chihuahuas...
Mind if I sit down?

Please.
And boys.

Young boys.
Coffee, black.

No doubt he's checked you
out over the past six weeks

and found no connection
to you in this world.

All he sees is a good
looking kid who's kind of lost.

You want to hold him?
Yeah.

He likes that.
Come here, baby.

If he's interested, the
first thing he'll do is ask you.

Do you live around here, Steve?

Your answer should be.
I'm on my own, bouncing around.

Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

Who's my buddy.
Yeah.

Then ask if...
You want to get a drink one evening?

Your answer should be.
Yeah.

Great. That's great ain't it?

Flunitrazepam.
Groovy.

You want me to kill him,
not rape him, right?

Two to three drops, he's woozy.

Over six, his heart stops and he's brain
dead in under three minutes.

Do it in the bar.
Make it clean.

All these fancy places they always
water down their boooze.

So I think that's why these are
going down so fast.

They don't water down
the wine, that's for sure.

It's really good.

Dig more?
Yeah.

Jameson, right?
Jamesons double, please.

Don't mess the wine with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

I want to know what you know.
I want to do.

What?
What's funny?

No. Nothings funny. I'm
just.. I think I had too many.

No, come on.

No.. I think I'm going to finish this one.
I'm going to finish this and I'm done.

I really should go to bed..
But this is very.. it's funny.

Steve!

Hey.

You all right?

Yeah, how are you?
I'm good, man.

Hey, can I give you a ride someplace?
Car is right here.

Come on. Get in.
I want to show you something.

Yeah?

He's six foot seven,
300 pounds and lethal.

Do not take this guy on.

And whatever you do,
never get into his car.

What do you think?

It's beautiful.
Let me get you a drink.

Do you paint?
Yeah, it's more of a hobby really.

Pretty serious hobby.

Cheers.

That's the sitting area and fireplace.

Chillaxing room.

This is the place I'm
most proud of right here.

Who's this god?
That is 14th century Buddha.

And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

It's nice to have friends. You know good
friends that make a difference.

You got good friends?

I mean really good friends.

You're shaking like a leaf. Sit down.

All right... all right.

Slow down, cowboy.

I told you to make it clean.

See you later.

Was it work or pleasure?

I wish someone would hurt me like that.

Hey!

Thanks. I'm going to call him Arthur.

Yeah?

You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

That's a violation of our arrangement.

My arrangement was with Harry.
You and I don't have one.

Just the price.

What thinks someone trained
by me would be valuable to you?

Harry McKenna's son.

Does he know you killed his father?

This job needs to be done immediately.
Client's willing to pay a premium for it.

I don't think so. It's too quick.

Your behaviour is making me
and the others extremely uneasy.

You're on a short leash with this one.

The file is a priority.

I'll looking it up.

I am one with God.
God touches me and I touch his people.

Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old.
Calls himself the new Messiah.

Reverend Vaughn.
Just Vaughn.

I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by any of the world religions.

I am above them. I am Vaughn.

He has made millions of dollars
to his churches, his ministries..

His television programs.
Basically, he is running a cult.

Adrenaline shot to the heart,
12 cc. S and he's dead under three minutes.

Adrenaline's unreliable.
One in four survive cardiac arrest.

When EMT's arrive, first thing they do
is jam you with a shot of epinephrine.

Which is toxic when combined with...
Adrenaline.

So, in the off chance our adrenaline
shot doesn't kill him?

The EMT's will.

He left a Bible study group with a
young devotee one night.

They didn't find her body
until two weeks later.

The autopsy said she had an abortion.
She was telling her friends that it was his.

Cost him 22 million dollars to hush it up.

Okay, let's get this over with.

Bless you!
Next.

Why don't you come sit right here?

You're new here aren't you?
How long have you been here?

Two weeks now.

How old are you?
18.

Eighteen.

You could've found her someone
more attractive to spy on.

He's still eating.

Soup, salad, sandwich..
Double chocolate cake.

Bishop, I'm hungry.

The guy at the deli, he had
bandage on all his fingers.

If you find a bandage in your
sandwich it wasn't mine.

You're all clear.

How do you feel, Vaughn?
How do you think I feel? Where's Frank?

Like I said, he must be here any minute.

Speak of the devil!

Give me something special today.
I feel like celebrating.

I have the spirit's work to do.

Spirits are not working with you.

The guys a junkie. He's giving him ketamine.

So?

Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.
This won't work now.

I have been tapped on
the shoulder... by God.

What do you want to do?

I did not ask this,

But my shoulder was touched by
the sword of a king.

He told me to rise up..

We got to pack it, eh?

Wait, wait.
If he comes back in here...

Leave your gloves on.

Hello?
Yes, yes, it is.

Hey!
Let's go.

Down his throat!... Down his throat.
Is this the chokee?

If they think that I'm
going to pay full price

for a four bedroom in
this market, they're crazy.

How can I change the world?

How can I be a better man
for my parishioners?

Let's go.
Sometimes I wonder.

Sometimes I wonder, if
I have the strength and courage.

I look at myself in the mirror
and think..

Christ!

Ralph, get in here!

What is it?
What is it!

Is he dead?
Yes, he's dead.

Stupid motherfucker!
I knew this was going to happen.

Get all this shit rounded up and get the
fuck out of here as fast as you can.

Try and pick him up!

Fuck!

Go check it out.

Take it off the wall.

Down the wall!

Follow him!

Cover the exit and give me
two guys on the roof. Now!

There he is!

Stay calm.

They're looking for two men.

A connected flight out of
Midway. I fly out of O'Hara

and we'll meet at
the house tomorrow.

Right this way. Go!

Andrew Vaughn, the controversial
and polarizing religious figure...

Has been pronounce dead.

The police are still
investigating the shooting that

occurred shortly there after. The
perpetrators have not been found.

All five are killed.
All five are killed.

You probably knew some of
the men on that team.

Terminal B?

Next bus, down the
street, leaves in 15 minutes.

Thanks.

When does this leave?
About 15 minutes.

Doesn't give us much time then.

What do you want?

I want to know what you're doing alive.

Last time I saw you
you had a bullet in your head.

What really happened in Cape Town?

Where's the rest of your team?
They're dead.

Who paid you? Was it Harry or Dean.

Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others.

Told me to fake my death, dissappear.

You know what else he told me?

That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation,

was about to blow the whistle.
He had to be taken care of.

They knew just the man for the job.

Someone who could get to him.

It's not the fact that
you killed him, is it?

It's that they played you so easily.
That's what bothers you.

Am I right?

Well?
Not so good for your side.

Those were two my best teams.
Guess I'll have to send more.

Save the fuel.
I'm coming for you.

When are you going to be home?

I'm really hungry.
Where are you?

I'm in the living room.

Sit down on the couch.
Okay.

Guessing you're not alone.

There's a gun down the left side cushion.

It's loaded and the safety's off.

But I'm not a lefty.
Then you're going to die.

All right, I see you when you get here.

I'll be there in five.

Who sent those guys?
The man who employs me.

Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

Are we set?

Get in the boat.

Do you ever think about the
people you've killed?

No.

Have you ever killed someone you knew?

Yes.

Did it feel any different?

Not in the moment.

After.

Some kind of warning or time to prepare?

Kind of time to..

Make peace.

There's no peace.

So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

Yes.

I guess it doesn't really matter anyway,
as long as they're dead and you not, right?

Hello, Finch.

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

I want you to listen to me closely.

You care who I hurt
or who I kill, understand?

Please, no, no. Stop.

You're gonna tell me exactly
what I came here to find out.

Where's Dean?

It's up to you how far I go... with this.

Wrist.

Elbow.

Please John, tell him
what he wants to know.

Okay, okay!
300, Golden Plaza!

300, Colby Plaza!
That's where he is. I swear!

So you're going to miss a good dinner.

My god! You bastard!

Yes.
How much was Harry's life worth?

50 million.

And here's what I'm gonna do.

Ten million wired to a bank of
your choice within 24 hours.

It's a good deal, you should take it.
Not interested.

And a killer grows a conscience!

I see that's a breach of
professional ethic, Mr. Bishop.

Harry's death was business.
Pure and simple.

Well, it's not going to be so simple now.

You got that right. 'Cause now I'm gonna
put a price on your head that's so big...

When you look in the mirror, your reflection
is gonna want to shoot you in the face.

You won't survive that long.
You're a fool.

You think you can get to me
before I get to you?

I already have.

Where's Conference Room E?
Floor upstairs, sir.

He's in the building.
Get me the fuck out of here!

They find Bishop?
Nothing yet.

Get out the fucking bus. Move!
Get out the fucking bus. Move!

Go!

Back up. Let's go.

Fuck you!

What's the plan, now?

Disappear.

New names, new occupation.
Together?

That's up to you.

What you gonna do? Gonna widdle
and get bunk pants. Fold into a tepee.

Want a water?

I've always had this...

Anger inside. Now I feel like I have...

A place to put it. I think I would miss
this if I had to stop now.

I could always go into
business for myself and...

A lot of people out there
who would pay...

And I think you were wrong.

Vengeance is the mission.

You want anything?
No.

Last chance.

I'm good.

Steve.

Sorry for everything that happened.

You know me, man.
I give a shit.

Watch number two.
