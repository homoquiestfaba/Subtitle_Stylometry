[brake squeals]


[indistinct police radio
chatter]

Yeah, it's blood.
[man] Good.

I hope they bleed to death.

It's the third time
in two months.

There are 47 bulbs
in the letter "G."

It's $3.10 a pop.

That's $145.70, every time.

That's an additional 13 dinners
I gotta sell just to float.

Are you listening to me?


Half our take is
from the interstate.

You drive by, you look up...

a Happy Meal.

[indistinct chatter]


Hey, Deke.

Yes, sir.

You remember a punk named
JJ Kendricks?

Robbed the Quick Mart?

We've got a witness who ID'd him,
but she's getting the, uh, guilts.

All she knows for certain is that he
was wearing a really nice pair of boots.

Fancy stitching.

"Unforgettable," she says.

But Kendricks is a suspect
in a robbery down in LA.

Down in LA?

Yeah.
Is this headed somewhere?

Yeah. And so are you.

There's a prelim day after
tomorrow with a motion to dismiss.

You drive to LA and bring back
the bloodstained boots,

she ID's them,
and the judge sets a trial date.

The blood, they definitely
ran the ABO on the blood?

That's correct.

is a DA problem, Captain, not ours.

Oh, no, it's our problem.

No evidence, no conviction.

I got nobody else.

Yes, sir.

[indistinct conversation]

[exhales deeply]

[grunts softly]

[Deke chuckles]

Don't look at me like that. You the
one been gone for the last two weeks.

[dog whining]

Ah...

I'll see you tonight.

[engine starts]

[indistinct conversation]

I'm, uh, here to pick up
seized evidence.

Property said it was here.

Yeah.

Excuse you.

Evidence is here, but it's not
leaving without a signature.

Ah.
Uh-uh. Not yours.

I need authorization
from Homicide to release.

There's a preliminary tomorrow.
Not my problem.

Captain Farris put a lock on
this item for testing.

It's already been tested.
Don't I know it.

He wants it re-tested.
Become a thing.

So I hear.

Hey, look. You get me a signature
and, uh, you can walk out of here...

wearing the damn things
for all I care.

[machine whirring]
[grunts]

Hey. Hey.

This yours?

Yeah, unhook it.
You blocked me in.

Why didn't you just
ask me to move it?

'Cause I don't have time.
You want special treatment?

Go back to Kern County.

Unhook it.

[tow hook clanks]

approach to this case.

To these cases.

Our city, our communities,
our citizens,

and above all else...

these innocent victims
deserve no less.

times I need to tell you, man.

Take it out of the file.
Please.


for your help.

If anyone has seen
or heard from anyone

that might somehow
be related to these cases...

Carl.

I see Brother Love's...
[clears throat]

salvation show's
still in operation.

Everybody needs a little faith.
Even you.

Got yourself a new disciple.

great guy.

You should listen in,
you might learn something on both counts.

Anyway...
The lab called.

Are you leaving town
when you're done?

You wanna take me to dinner?
Want you out of here.

They'll run the test
first thing in the morning

and if there's no match,
you're gone.

Tomorrow's no good.
My CO told me...

Ah, I called your CO.

He says you should hang
until the tests are complete,

deliver the evidence tomorrow.

Okay?

Good to see you, Captain.

Look at it this way...

give you a chance to visit all
those friends you left behind.

return to the scene of the crime?

How's it feel
to be back in uniform?

Still padding your overtime,
Rogers?

Ooh. That's, uh, Sergeant Rogers now, Deke. Yes.
Sergeant Rogers?

Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

Hmm.
[phone ringing]

Your phone's ringing.

Yeah, I know.

We are being meticulous
and methodical in our efforts.

Sergeant Rogers.
Yeah, but what did he say?

evaluating and prioritizing leads...

Nice to see you, Deke.
Good to see you, too.

...and gathering
additional evidence.

I can assure you all,
we are taking a 24/7,

all-hands-on-deck approach
to this case.

These cases.
[imperceptible]

Questions.

[journalists clamoring]

Correct me if I'm wrong,
but what I'm hearing is

after two months
and four victims,

you don't have a suspect.

None that I can discuss.

[journalists chattering]


We haven't been under this much
scrutiny since the Night Stalker.

There's talk.

Sheriff hinted that we might wanna
reach out to the feds for help.

Are you kidding me?
Some point.

Some point, Jimmy.
Not today.

Deke?

Son of a bitch.

The man, the myth, the legend.
Hey, Sal.

You still hanging around?

No rest for the ugly.

[chuckles]
What are you doing here?

Eh, don't ask, don't tell.

I'm just going across the
street, let me buy you a cup.

Come on,
what's one cup of coffee?

All right.

Yeah.

Who is that, talking to Sal?

Kern County patrol dep.

That's Joe Deacon.

You're kidding.

No.

a bunch of nancies.

End of shift, I gotta beg for
somebody to grab a beer with.

They got no soul,
these new guys.

They weeded all the heart
out of the place.

But then, you know that
better than anybody.

Hey, Sarge.
Sal.

You know Joe Deacon?
Get what you came for?

I will.

You got nothing better to do than
to bust my balls in the meantime?

Nothing personal.
Deke busts everybody's balls.

John Q. Public

into thinking that
the worst is behind us,

that's your business,
until the next time,

but, hey,
it's your shift, right?

Yeah, it is.

I hear you're a good cop.

I hear things, too.

[taps on glass]

College boy,

bit of a Holy Roller, but, hey, I've
been thinking about joining them myself.

Get on the fast track
for a promotion.


You wanna stay with me
and the wife tonight?

Thank you, though.

Good to see you, Deke.
Good to see you, too, brother.

[door opens]

Why don't you
ride over with me?

Maybe you can even
give me a few pointers.

[siren whoops]
[helicopter whirring]

[indistinct
police radio chatter]

Everybody outside, nobody in.
Dollar to a dime, it's a decomp.

Baxter. 362071.
What's everybody waiting around for?

Power's off
inside the victim's building.

You call Edison?
They're working on it now.

You been inside?

How big's the place?
Two-room efficiency.

Due to the victim's
body position,

access is through the adjacent
apartment's fire escape.

We got generators on the truck.

Nah, let's let
the wazoo boys go to work.

You wanna superglue
the whole apartment?

Why not? We're dead in the water
until the power comes back on.

You familiar with all of this?
No.

Things probably changed a lot
since you left.

Still gotta catch him, right?

Yeah.
Hmm.

Not that much
has changed, then.

Anybody want some menthol?

Everyone eat?

[woman 1 sobbing]

[woman 2 speaks indistinctly]

[Jamie speaks Spanish]

[woman muttering indistinctly]


Lights off.

Holy shit!

stab wound, body cavity.

Another stab wound.

She crawled to here...

all the way to here.

This is where she died.

So, why is she there?

They lift prints
from this window?

Hey, Jimmy,
they dust that ledge yet?

Get me the first officer.

Still making house calls,
eh, Flo?

Oh, good Lord.

You in town for a while?
No.

Stick around till I'm finished.


Joe Deacon, meet Julie Brock.

Julie's 5'4", a buck 20,
and hails from Manhattan, Kansas.

This job sucks.


Our killer exited the same way
we came in.

It's your responsibility to secure and protect
the premises from anyone who might spoil it.

From the moment she expired to the
time I cuff whoever did this...

we work for her.

Yes, sir.
Get out of here.

[technician 1] It's starting
to look a lot like Illinois.

It's Michigan.
Cut it out.


[technician 1] Yeah, but it's broken.
Stuff's rotten.



[indistinct conversations]

Hey.

When's your boy, Columbo,
gonna break my case for me?

[Sal chuckles]

Deke's got his own style.

[female officer] We're still
processing out that room.

What do you got, Flo?

She assumed room temperature
two or three days ago.

We'll know more when we take her in.
[Jim] Lean her forward.

[female officer]
Check the closets.

Postmortem lividity.

She was moved.

[indistinct
police radio chatter]

[camera clicks]

All right, canvass the block,
knock on every door, quiz every hooker.

Find out Julie's habits,
friends, suitors, enemies.

They get anything
across the alley?

on the floor for semen, all negative.

Pull files on any known
sex offenders in the area.

Peeping Toms, neighborhood
arrests, transients included.

Lean on the lab for prints,
all right?

Mm-hmm.
Jamie, lean on 'em.

Okay.

Awfully quiet
back there, Kojak.

[Deke laughs]
Am I missing something?

Any of the other girls
have bites?

Carrie Holland.

One of 'em. Why?

Similar to a case up north,
that's all.

[grunts softly]

Deacon.

Yeah?

Sal says you're here overnight.

How about you buy me breakfast?

Why would I wanna do that?


Nick's, 0800.

If I'm still here.

[soft music playing]

[indistinct chattering]

[siren wailing nearby]

[both panting]

Go again on Wednesday?

Yeah, sure. I'll run you home.

Three blocks. I'll be fine.

Night.
Bye.

[indistinct chatter]

[Henry on phone] <i>Yeah,
surprised the DA, too.</i>

<i>She made a second-degree offer.</i>

Kendricks copped a plea.

What about
the unforgettable boots?

<i>Forget 'em. Don't need 'em.
Neither will Kendricks.</i>

Not where he's going.

<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
All right.

Morning.

Morning.
Look, I know it was you

spotted the observatory
across the street last night.

Might have missed that one
without you.

You're welcome.

When you leaving?
Right now.

I got something you might wanna sit in on.

He got picked up twice for peeping
in the victim's neighborhood.

Sheet says he's a KSO.

Stan Peters.

Picked up this morning
on a Ramey warrant.

Letting him stew a bit.

He wants a mouthpiece.

You might wanna stay.

Nice boots.

[Deke munching]

[door thuds]

Hi, Stan. Jim.

Where's my lawyer?
In the building.

Takes a while.

A girl from
your neighborhood...

dead.

And you,
a known sex offender...

I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

You had your dick out.

[Stan] This girl...
[Jim] Teenage girl, Stan.


You gotta believe me.

I want to.

I got nothing to do with this.


What can you tell me
about Mary Roberts?

What? [sobs]

Mary Roberts.

[uneasy music playing]

[Stan shuddering]

Stan Peters?</i>

Dead girl, suspect.

Was he your boy?

You never know.
Just saying hello to an old pal.

Well, your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

still doing here?


Order up the poor boy
on a Mary Roberts.

I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

Nah, I'm good.

The Rathbuns are waiting.


Yeah, they think
their daughter Ronda's a stat.

We got a corpse?

Then it's still
Missing Persons.

[girl 1] So crazy, girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

[girl 2 squeals]
[laughter]

[soft music playing]


of looking at dead bodies?

[Flo chuckles]

I could ask you the same.

[romantic music playing
on radio]

What's this all about, Joe?


Thanks for doing this for me, Flo.
No problem.

She won't see the knife
till tomorrow.

Well, she won't see
another knife.

General proximity, similar pattern
and depth to our other four.

The garbage bag was an adornment
placed on her head postmortem.

Maybe when the guy came back.

Came back?

Unless he was a babysitter,
he made a return trip,

moved the girl and propped her
up against the door.

Now, turn that up for me.


[increases volume]

Mm... KHRT. Love songs
of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

You get a dental on the bites?

Right. Uh...

Yeah, we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

It could be the same as we
found on the Holland girl.

More sucking, less biting.

Any saliva samples?

Funny you should ask.

I found traces of sodium
benzoate in the bites.

What's that?
Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

And check this out.

He gave her a postmortem shave.

Nicked her, no blood.

What about her D-tract?

She had one good meal
before she died.

Speaking of which, you hungry?

I'll buy if you pull up
an old file for me.

Yeah.

Case up north, my ass.

The fuck is going on, Joe?

I'll pull your file.

But if something goes wrong,
I can't be there for you again, okay?

Okay.

[volume decreases]

You knew him, didn't you?

At least, he knew you. [scoffs]

That's why he did that
to your face.

You let him in.

You thought...

"Eh...

Not my type," but...

maybe he could be
a friend. I mean,

you can't get enough of them.

But then you had
that one little feeling.

You thought, "What if?"

But you waved it away.

Thought, "Ah, what the hell?

Life's too short."

And you were right.

Life is too short, Julie.

And you should've listened.

You should've listened to
that one little feeling, but...

Just like I'm listening
to you now.

You can talk to me.

I'm all the friend you got.

on the world, Joe?

There's good and there's bad,

but you gotta fight.

[music playing faintly
on speaker]

Because, brother...

when I look in your eyes,

what I see...

it ain't good.

To remind me of what I did.

For what we did.

[door creaking]

[muffled chattering]

you guys were finished.

How long has this, uh,
fridge been broken?

I don't know. A week, maybe.

You're responsible for repairs?

Oh, are you thinking
about moving in?


No, ma'am.

I called a guy to come fix it, but, uh,
then, you know, the girl got killed.

So, suddenly,
it didn't seem so important.

And, I mean, look. I gotta paint the
walls and get rid of the mattress.

Who'd you call?
[sighs]

Uh, a place
around the corner.

AB... ABC Appliance.
Something like that. ABC Appliance.

And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm. Except the milk?

My kid drank it, so cuff me.
Oh.

Anything else?
In the fridge?

There were a few beers. Why?

I'm gonna need it for evidence.

For evidence.
Yeah, okay.

Coming right up.
All righty.



[somber music playing]

[door opens]

ever get used to it?

What's that, ma'am?

The smell.

You know, if you're lucky,
you don't get used to it.

[landlady sighs] Here.

Close up when
you're done, okay?

[door closes]

[indistinct chatter]

I don't want any trouble.

I have no connection
to the girls out front.

Just need a room.
Oh.

$20 a night, $100 a week.

There are some things in there
from the last guy.

Just toss 'em in the hallway.

And don't worry,
the sheets are clean.

Hey!

Do you want some company?

[keys clinking]

[sighs heavily]

[sirens wailing in distance]

[Jim] <i>Good night. I love you.</i>
[Chloe] <i>Love you.</i>

I love you.
Love you.

Did you say your prayers?
Yep.

I'll see you tomorrow.
[Chloe] Night.


[Ana] Hey.
[Jim] Mm?

Did you set the alarm?

Yeah.

[soft music playing]


Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

Jimmy.

All of 'em.

Close it.

Stan Peters.
What about him?

Killed himself last night.

That's not good.

What the hell's this got to do
with Kern County?

Deacon watched
through the glass.

He's got a similar case
up north.

It's just a little
interagency cooperation.

Guy hasn't worked a murder since
we ran him off five years ago.

Do you know the book on him?

A great detective,
has a heart attack,

leaves town
for a post in the sticks.

The guy worked
the case so hard,

he got a suspension, a divorce and
a triple bypass, all in six months.

Complete meltdown.

He's a rush-hour train wreck.

That's a tad dramatic.

Only good came out of it,
we got you.

What are you saying?
I took his spot?

Manner of speaking, yeah.

Piece of personal advice,
Jimmy,

you got a good thing
going here.

Don't get mixed up
with this guy.

What's the big deal? He's gone.

His CO says
he's taken vacation days.

Yeah, so what?
Does he strike you

as the kind of guy
that plays golf?

[suspenseful music playing]

Employee list.

Repair appointment book.

Look for yourself.

[engine starts]


[store owner] So, I could even
have it delivered to you tomorrow.

All you gotta do is go out and
get some food, put it in there,

your kids are gonna be happy,
you're ready to go.

Excuse me a minute.

What can I do for you?
I'm Joe Deacon.

I need to see all repair orders
for the last two weeks,

and a list
of all your employees.

Thank you.

It's okay.
You're not under arrest.

Yet.

[indistinct conversation]

Here you go.
Thank you very much. Ah, this one.

This one's crossed out.

It's a cancellation.
Yeah?

That's before
I can get a man out.

And it always takes that long?

Hey, we're busy.

Yeah.

Yeah, I see.

And this is the list?

Mm...

Mm.

And your name is?
Jack.

You all right, Jack?

[Deke chuckles]

What's your last name, Jack?

Aboud.


You don't mind
if I take your list, do you?

<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

Thanks, Jack.

[store doorbell chimes]

Did you look at my print
from the Brock apartment?

It's no good
without one to compare to.

The center's missing and the computer
can't work without the center.

Look on the bright side,
the guy finally left a partial.

What exactly is it you guys do?

We make you look good in court.

[door slams]

[laughter on video]
<i>Dad!</i>

Jewelry, maybe?

[Mrs. Rathbun] A red barrette.

When she ran, she always used to wear
a red barrette to hold her hair back.

Really? This how you
spend your time off?

you saw two hoop-dees

and a meat wagon
going 20 miles an hour?

They didn't wanna come
any more than I did.

What have you got?


Stab wound, ligature,
killed elsewhere.

She a floater?
Yeah.

But they dumped overflow
in here a few days back.

Guessing there's mud
in her cavities.

Shallow grave, most likely.

You ready to tell me
about Mary Roberts?

Your boy, Stan Peters,
swallowed a 12-gauge late last night.

come give a look.

[indistinct police radio
chatter]

any better, from up here...

you might say it's beautiful.

Sal told me you went to bat
for me with Farris.

It's not a wise career move.

You're not exactly
a department favorite.

Maybe I can make it up to you.

You might wanna run these names.
Couple of possibles.

They were working in appliance
stores in Julie Brock's neighborhood.

It's a long shot.

Aren't they all?

Thank you.

Something I gotta know.

How's a guy with the best
clearance rate in the department

work 15 years
without a promotion?

Maybe I didn't go
to the right church.


Do you believe in God, Joe?

When I see a sunrise
or thunderstorm

or dew on the ground,
yes, I think there's a God.

When I see all this,
I think he's long past giving a shit.

I still owe you breakfast.

Yes, you do.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Joe's in Kern County now.

Mm. Your wife drag you away?

I'm divorced.

Oh. Well, I'd like to get out of the
city, but Jim won't leave.

[chuckles]
Hm.

You work homicide there, too?

Uh, no, ma'am. I'm just a...

a dep.


[Deke] Hi.
My precious.

That's Mr. Deacon, Chloe.

How do you do?

Very well.

Do you have any kids, Joe?

Uh, two girls. They're...
they're all grown now.

All grown up.

I'm gonna be late.

We ready to take Jen to school, baby?
Mwah.

Got a parent-teacher conference
until 5:00,

so the girls are gonna stay
at Mom's until dinner.

[Jim] That's fine.
Okay. I love you.


Nice to meet you, Joe.

Thank you. [clears throat]

[door opens]
She's beautiful.

They all are.

Yeah.
[door closes]

I'll run the names on the list.
Where can I reach you?

St. Agnes.

I've heard of living on the beat,
but that's above and beyond.

Wanna meet after shift,
compare notes?

You may have to ask the
Reverend Captain about that.

It's my case.

You look good, Marsha.

You too, Joe.
Thank you.

I was just on my way to work.
If I'd known you were coming by...

Gotta get going anyway.

Let me... let me grab my purse.
Okay.

[door closes]
House looks good.

Glad you kept it.

Lawn, too.

Yeah, well, Tom's a...

He's a wiz in the yard.

Better than me.

Well, you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

How are the girls?

Good.
Good.

You ought to give 'em a call.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, I should.

You all right?

You know me.

Yeah.

I know you.

Well...

I gotta...

All right.

Bye, Joe.

Bye, Marsha.

Paige Callahan, Tamara Ewing.

I only asked for Roberts.

Yeah, well,
all the victims were hookers,

they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

on the same night
in the same location.

You gotta be kidding me.

Yeah, I'm hilarious.

[rock music playing]
[indistinct chatter]

I never figured
you to be so hip.

[Deke chuckles]

Yeah, they must have...

must have changed owners.

You want something to drink?

Don't worry, I won't tell.

Where are you from? Originally.

The Valley.

Where are you from?

Originally.
Mississippi Valley.

Alabama, Birmingham.

Well, here's to being
from somewhere.

Cheers.
Cheers.

All right,
last night's victims...

so we got six now.

One, Julie Brock,
never left home.

Three from the north county,
bodies dumped here.

Two from here,
bodies dumped in north county.

And who said
busing doesn't work?

All knifed, all gagged,
all bound,

all very organized killings.

Not a lot of wasted motion.

So, I got a question. Why?
Why what?

First, geography.

Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops, he dies.

He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

Maybe two. High mileage.

Can't find one
in the neighborhood, a victim,

then, uh, he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

All right, next "why." Why the
extreme torture, then the love bites?

Turns him on.

No rape, no sodomy,

no genital mutilation. Hm.
He kills for sexual pleasure.

Was Stan Peters our boy?

God, I hope not.

All right, back to the living.
Our boy.

He's got balls.
I'll give him that. [scoffs]

He goes back to Julie's house,

a few days after he kills her,
moves her body, shaves her legs,

poses her, he brings beer,

milk, food. Just threw
himself a little party.

And they found partially
digested meat in her stomach.

But she was a vegan.
Strict vegetarian.

She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

Not even with a knife
to her throat?

Nobody wants to eat alone.


One last "why."

Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

that everyone else
has forgotten about?

[suspenseful music playing]

Farris and I were...

a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

No lights.

Switching problem. Guy from Edison said
it happens once every decade or so.

Now, you see the woman
behind me

over my left shoulder?
Yeah.

Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

And what did good old
Gladys have to say?

Said she was out. She lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment,

but she came clean.

What was she embarrassed about?

She went on her first date in 15
years, slept at the old guy's house.


So, the night of the hat trick,
we had no lights,

Gladys getting boned...

two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

in a dead heat.

Third strike.

Drought.

No water, no mud, no prints.

Ground was hard like cement.

Victims were placed
on that rock right there.

They were drugged elsewhere, but they
were brought here, stabbed to death.

Posed facing each other,

bags over their heads, laid down,
like the rock was a table, like a...

tea party.

Where the guests fell asleep.

Warm. This just went down.

And where was
your third victim?


You work the evidence,
you still come up with zeros.

It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

Then you draw the black bean.

Maybe the victim looks like
a kid you picked on in school

or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

Or maybe it's something else,
but whatever it is,

they're your lifelong
responsibility, Jimmy.

You own them.

You own them.

They're wherever they are,
and you are their angel,

trying like hell to turn the
ledger from red to black.

Word to the wise, Jimmy,
stay out of the angel business.


What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

To finish the job.

Just like you.


Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

Yeah, nobody's that good
out of the block.

This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

Well, it can't be the same guy.

He's a shark, remember?
He stops, he dies.

Who said he stopped? Maybe he
just took his show on the road.

I'm over here on the right.

Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

One's 55, the other one's in his
late thirties, lives in Hollywood.

Both simple assaults.

It looks like a wash to me,

but you got all the info there.

And for the record, your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

Then why all the interest?

You wanna clear your
conscience, that's your problem.

But you gotta solve my case to
solve yours, who am I to moan?


But you piss on my leg and call it
rain, we're through.

Hey, uh, what was
Julie's last supper?

It was roast beef. Why?

It's the little things
that are important, Jimmy.

It's the little things
that get you caught.

[engine idling]

[engine stops]


the "for sale" sign.

That was for another car.

Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

No.

How's the trunk space?

It's standard.

Mind if I take a look?

I'm in the market.

It's not for sale.

All I need to do is
take a look.

You must really like my car.

I do.
[chuckles]

[suspenseful music playing]

[indistinct chatter]


Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

Yeah, see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.


Inconclusive.

But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

Partial of an incisor
on Ewing's cheek.

What about Brock?

Partial of a bicuspid.

Something else.
What's that?

He's from back east.

Folds his slice.

Baxter.
The second girl, the ditch pitch,

where did you find her?

Couple hundred yards after 126.

And you didn't leak it to the press?
No.

You sure about that?

It went out over dispatch,
but it was never given to the press. Why?

What's the nearest mile marker?

Hang on.

467.

[over phone] <i>4-6-7.</i>

There's this guy Deke asked me to
run a vehicle check on. Sparma?

Seems that Topanga Tow
has a car registered to him.

Found it abandoned
two weeks ago.

Reported stolen?

No.

Well, tow that sucker in.

[machinery whirring]

[indistinct chatter]

Wine.
[whispers] Damn it.

Sal, what do you got?

Clean. 22,000 miles.

A rollback?
Definitely.

All right, keep at it.
Let me know if you find anything.


I'll take the prints.
Call the lab, tell 'em I'm on my way.

Grab Deke and a patrol dep,
pick up Sparma.

What about Tina Salvatore,
the potential witness?

Get her a magazine.

What are the chances
he'll let us in?

Yeah. Just keep him busy,
keep him talking.

Tell him to take his time,
change his clothes, whatever.

Match is inconclusive.

Conclude it.
Eleven identifiers.

County requires 18 for an ID,
LAPD requires 12.

So, we're one short of
somebody's legal requirements?

That says something.
It says you're seven short.

Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't my boy.

This other fella...

let's call him Mr. X...

he's got eight identifiers.
Only three less than Sparma.

Maybe he's the killer.

Who?


Thank you.

[slams door]

Are we ready to go?

I told the police...</i>

it was dark, he was
wearing glasses, a hat...

If I showed you some photos, do you
think you'd be able to identify him?

Maybe.

Probably not.

Nothing. It was like
he was expecting us.

Get her something to drink.
Keep an eye on her.

I have to use the restroom.

Yep. [sighs] Come on.

It's, uh, right over here, to your right.
I'll wait for you.

Hey, you got a second, Jamie?

It's okay. I can find my way
back to your desk.

All right,
do you want anything to drink?

Uh... Diet anything.

Just come straight back, okay?

What's up?
Thanks.

The Harvester was clean
as a whistle.

Damn it.

Got this off your desk.

You don't mind if I move
the table, do you?

Do your thing.

Grab the other end.


Bring him in.

Okay, Jerry.

[elevator bell dings]

Well, what did you have to do
to get a job like this?

Kind of a demotion, huh?

[door opens]

No, we're not gonna need those.

Where's big Dick Tracy?

Is he joining us for dinner?

Ow. Man...

Hello, Albert.

I'm Detective Sergeant Baxter.

I know who you are.

You're famous.

On television and in the papers
all the time.

Thank you so much.

I'm kind of a crime buff.


[door closes]

Well, then you know
if you're innocent,

you should talk to me,
clear your name.

Is that it?

Not gonna work me over,
Mr. Clean?

Okay.

I invoke my Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination.

Just kidding.

[Albert chuckles]

You should see
the look on your faces.

Come on, it's hilarious.

But I would like my rights
waiver card.

I know I'm not
officially in custody, but...

better be safe than sorry,
huh, guys?

Hot damn.

This is awesome.

Can I keep this?

No, I'm afraid not.

No fun.

Hey, you wanna know something?
Ernesto Miranda...


Why did you abandon
your car, Albert?

The Harvester. Had a big back end,
was good for hauling things around.

Look, Jimmy.

Detective Baxter.
Whatever.

Like I said, the car was stolen.
Thank you for finding it.

I'll drive it home.

We'll be hanging on to it
for a few days.

Well, that's not
very nice of you.

Why didn't you
report the theft?

Well, you see,
that's the funny thing.

I did.

Somebody's got some
homework to do.

Mm. Cute little thing,
wasn't she?

Who said she's dead?
I know the drill, Jimmy.

But the truth is...

I'm not the guy.

Besides, if you had anything...

anything at all...

I'd be under arrest...

wouldn't I?

Do you want to be?

I wouldn't mind getting a peek at
all that evidence you say you got.


You get the feeling
he's enjoying this?

Oh, yeah.

Pineapples and jalapenos,
please.

Can I come in?

Eleven more,
you can make a calendar.

Uh-oh.

Oh, hey, stranger.

Tired of steaming up
that glass?

Pressies?

Oh, yeah.

This is the part where I start
feeling like it's a trap.

Open it up, find out.

[chuckles softly]

It's not a pair of mittens.


[clicks tongue] Wow.


You know you want to.

Open it, you fucking weirdo.

Holy guacamole.

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

catch a dead girl by her toe.

Oh...

[Albert inhales deeply]

The contrast is all off.

It's no Weegee.

[Albert scoffs]

My God.

Let me ask you a question.

Why is that?

Huh?

Why is that?

you're a smart man.

You know every exit
on the highway.

Let me help you.

[chair slides]

I mean it.

Why?

Why not?

Son of a bitch. Your dick is
as hard as Chinese arithmetic.

Shit.
Son of a...

[Jim] Deke! Hey, Deke!
[Deke] That's why.

That's why.
[Jim] Back off!

Why is that? Why is that?
[Sal] Deke! Hey! Whoa!

That's what I wanna know.
[Jim] Back off.


It's all right, Sal.

We know, you know...

[Albert giggles]

...we got you by the balls,
small as they are.

You son of a bitch.

You lost control.

[Albert exhales]

[door closes]

[phone rings]
Rizoli.

Huh. Jimmy, it's your wife.
Take a message.

[breathes sharply]

What do you think?

Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

a better look?


I mean, you have him
here in the station, right?

Thank you, Tina.

[slams on chair]

What about a lineup?</i>

We've got no cause.

I mean, the ID is
tainted beyond repair.

She saw him in cuffs,
for God's sake.

I warned you.</i>


I'm the primary.
For now.

What the hell does that mean?

It means I got six bodies, no
witnesses, no evidence, no killer.

Two guys questioned,
and why are they suspects?

One, who later sucks
on a 12-gauge,

for malicious unzipping.

The other, for carrying
a concealed hard-on.

What do you want the DA to do?
He was visualizing the crime.

His crime.

Well, sheriff's calling
in the feds.

They got a guy
coming in on Monday.

That point, we back off,
we revamp.

Revamp?
They take charge.

Hey, uh, one more thing.

Were you aware Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?


and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

He signs a confession.
Next morning, we had to cut him loose.

Why?
[Rogers] He was lying.

I mean,
he knew all the details,

but he wasn't within
ten miles of the killing.

Still got two days, right, Cap?

Hey, what is it with
you and Deke?

You wanna be the one that finds
him after his next heart attack?

It's his destiny,
don't make it yours.

Deacon.

[doorknob rattles]

[tense music playing]


What is... what is all this?

The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

becomes the future,
becomes the past, becomes the...

Hey. Look at me.
Becomes the future.

This is sick.

You need to get some help.
Don't point fingers.

I know all the symptoms.

Congratulations.
We got a suspect.

Oh, we do, do we?

Yeah.

Are you aware that Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

So what?

He walked in, jerked Rogers'
chain for an entire shift.

He's a crime buff,
he said so himself.

Walk-in confessors
aren't killers.

We don't have shit!

You got the same ache
in your gut as I do, don't you?

We got something,
we just don't know what it is.

If I can get in Sparma's apartment
for just five minutes, I know...

We don't have enough
for a warrant.

...like I'm standing
in front of you.

I know.

Know what?

I know that the answer is
inside Sparma's place. I know.

Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

What do you want?

I wanna nail the bastard.

For who?

For all of the girls he killed.

And for Ronda Rathbun,
wherever she is.

nail the bastard, too.

Difference is...

I'm doing it for me.

Just five minutes, Jimmy.

Please.

about what happened today,</i>

<i>and I'd like to
make it up to you in person.</i>

Meet me at Pike's,
near your place, on the bully.

We'll see.

an "officer down."

Wily son of a bitch.

Wily enough to keep his
apartment clean?

He's got a box full of
knickknacks and souvenirs.

By any chance,
did you see a red barrette?

Red barrette?
Yeah.

Ronda Rathbun was wearing one
when she disappeared.

You give me five more minutes,
I can find out for you.

All right, bad news first.

Sparma did file a stolen on the wagon.
Rogers neglected to file.

The good...

Sparma left town less than
six weeks after your murders.

Where'd he go?

Detroit.

Any unsolved bodies up there?


[both chuckle]


He knows we're here.
He knows we're watching him.

Good.

I want him to know.

Do you ever wonder...

that maybe, just maybe,
it's a waste of time?

All this sitting, waiting...

watching, spending your life
in another man's shadow.

One, wherever he goes,
I mark it for search warrants.

Two, he tries it again,
I catch him in the act.

Three, when I'm with him...

nobody dies.

Nobody dies on my watch.

How long is your watch?

[door opens]

As long as it fucking takes.

[door closes]

What's he doing?

[old timey pop music

How can you listen to these
sappy love songs all day long?

in the backseat of my car...

with Marsha McConnell.

Guy's got a car,
why's he taking the bus?

<i>â™ª Follow him
wherever he may go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There isn't
an ocean too deep â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A mountain so high

<i>â™ª I must follow him â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ever since he touched
my hand I knew â™ª</i>


We're running out of sand,
this guy's taking public transportation.



[soft funk music playing]

[Deke] Whoa. Whoa.
Ah, fuck!


I'm all right.

Okay.

Mm-hmm.

We work the case.
That's all we can do, is work the case.

It's like fishing.

You can go days without a strike,
then all of a sudden, bang, you get one.

I'm fucking dying here, Deke.

Okay. Why don't you go home,

I'll put him to bed.

Fuck you.
There you go.

That's what I expected.

[old timey music

You think they got watch
batteries down there?

Mm.

All right, I'm gonna go down there.
So, you want anything?

Black coffee.

All right.

Is this right? This...

Forward!
Okay. Fine.

Hands on your head!

Interlace your fingers.


Interlace your fingers.

Oh. Um...

That sounds complicated. Mm.

Point your fingers to the sky.

Now!

Spread your legs.
Thought you'd never ask.

[Albert chuckles]

Where is she?
Oh.

The original. How did you wrangle
that, Mr. Fancy Pants?

[gate rattles]


Where is she?


You don't wanna know.

Not really.


Okay.

You win.

I'll take you to her.

Would you like that?

Jeez.

Are you coming?

You got some serious anger issues, Jimmy.
You know that?

You almost cracked my rib.

[store doorbell chimes]


60, 70...

[engine starts, revs]

[ominous music playing]

Come on.

I won't bite.

Get in.
We've got a drive ahead of us.

And I've gotta work tomorrow.

You already felt me up.
You're armed, I'm not.

What are you so scared of,
little boy?

Oh, PS, your buttbuddy's
not invited.

Buckle up.

Safety first.

[tires screeching]

[suspenseful music playing]

You know,
you're not very good company.

Where exactly is it
we're going?


[suspenseful music continues]

You know,
you and I are a lot alike.

In another lifetime...

uh, we could be friends.

Isn't that crazy?

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

You mind?

[gate creaking]

[gate clanks]

[ominous music playing]

[Albert sighs]

I knew a guy
who had a hunting lease here.

And we got the moon tonight.

Cut the bullshit. Where is she?

All business.

You start walking that way.


I'm a man of my word, Jimmy.

Chilly.


Colder.


God, you're really terrible
at this, you know that?

Let me give you a hint.


Okay.

Uh-uh. Warm.

Warmer.

Hot. Hotter.

Hottest.

Bingo.

Now look down at the ground
and say...

"Hello, Ronda."

[ominous music continues]

You're gonna need this.

You dig.

in the details, Jimmy.

Witnesses, physical evidence.

You'd have to get rid of
my body, get rid of my car.

It's a lot to consider.

[Albert grunts]

Besides...

it's a peace offering.

Okay.

Oh, you're gonna kill me.

Uh...

Oh, poop.

I think I made a boo-boo.

Yeah. Come to think of it,
this doesn't look that familiar.

But this one over here...

this looks very promising.

Yeah, that's it.

What did you say?


"Poop."

"This one is more promising."

It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

you keep talking.


Third time's the charm.


It's like the cereal aisle.

You want the truth?

I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

If you believe me, we can get in the
car and we can drive straight home.

Maybe even stop for tacos.

If not...

[shoveling]
That's it.

Not too much longer now.

What are you, five, six deep,
and no end in sight?

[Jim grunting]

Oh...

I forgot to tell you.

I've seen a picture
of your family.


You should've stayed out
of the public eye, Jimmy.

You and your ego.

I mean, what kind of
a father are you?

How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

when you can't even
begin to help one...

of those poor girls
or their families?

You're insignificant.

You don't matter.

And this will go on
and on and on.

And there's nothing
you can do about it.

[Jim breathing shakily]

Hey. Hey. Hey, get up.

Get up, man.

Get up!

Get up!

[ominous music playing]

[breathing heavily]

[gasps softly]

[Sal] Deke, what is it?
[whispers] Quiet.

[gunshot echoes]


Oh.

<i>becomes the future...</i>

<i>becomes the future.</i>

It was him.

We got him. He was our boy.

He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

Nothing you can do
about it now.

We gotta call somebody.

What am I gonna say?

What am I gonna do?

Nothing. You're not gonna say
anything, you're not gonna do anything.

You're gonna find a hole,
stick him in it.

Pick one at least four feet deep.
I'll be back in a few hours.

[suspenseful music playing]

[man 1] What'd she say, man?

[man 2] What's up with homeboy
there?

Hey.

[suspenseful music continues]



He was our boy, Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

So, listen...

you go back,

you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash,

and that you need a break.

A couple of weeks. You tell him
I left town Saturday,

and you went home.

Are you listening to me?

He's dead.

He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

and the only way he's gonna come
back is if you let him come back.

Don't you ever go back to his
place,

don't you ever let his name
cross your lips,

don't you ever pull his file,
'cause if you do...

he'll rise up out of that
ground. He'll do you in.

It's the little things, Jimmy.

It's the little things
that rip you apart,

it's the little things that...

get you caught.

That's my boy.

[car door opens and closes]

[engine starts]

He was...

Joe...

[sighs, speaks Spanish]


[jazz music playing on radio]

He's of above-average intelligence

Works as a skilled laborer.

Probably firstborn or an only

<i>He has at least one car in good

<i>and he has a propensity

<i>Picking up,

<i>That, ladies and gentlemen,

What about the leads we're

I think it's safe to say we're

But I can promise you this.

We'll get the bastard.

Ana.
Hey, Sal.

Come in.

Thanks. I gotta get going.

You okay?

Yeah. Well... [sighs]

We miss him already. Uh...

Joe Deacon gave me this.

Said it was for Jimmy.

Thanks.

Take care.

You too.

Thanks, Sal.

<i>You know I love you, Dad.</i>
<i>But go away?</i> [laughs]

<i>You're always around

Sal brought this by.

He said it was from Joe Deacon.
