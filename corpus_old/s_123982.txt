That's great.

Uh

Look at him.

I know what Lauri's doin'. She's just
dancing with him to make me jealous.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah.

<i>##[Continues]</i>

Havin' a good time?

It's okay.

So, uh, you see anyone
you'd like to dance with?

Hey, sweet thing.
Wanna dance?

Reggie, no.

Please, Reggie, don't.

Aw, come on, baby. Don't be like that.
I said stop it, Reggie!

<i>Hey, you should be glad</i>
<i>I even danced with you.!</i>

Hey, man. You're like school
on Saturday. No class.

I knew I should've never
come to this party.

Rudy, be a gentleman.
See how Doris is doing.

Hey.

You stay away from her...

or you're gonna
have to deal with me.

Right. Uh, next time.

Lauri, wait. Lauri.

<i>Doris. Doris, would you</i>
<i>please wait?</i>

Doris.

We thought we were helping.
Helping what?

I don't have a problem.

I was doing just fine
before you guys arrived.

So, uh, do you have, like,
a special guy or somethin'?

No, I don't have time for boys.

Anyway, I'm better off
working on my writing.

Oh, you want to be a writer?
Mmhmm.

Since I was a little girl.

I want to tell stories.
Really? What kind?

I don't know. I guess...

kind of personal stuff.

You know, maybe about how
a person feels because...

their parents...
are no longer around.

Sorry about that.
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

I miss them a lot.

Sometimes it hurts so bad, I don't want
to care about anyone again.

You know what? You should be
walking on this side of the street.

Why?

Is that some kind of macho thing?

No, it's just, you know, the gentleman
should walk on the side with the traffic.

That way, if a car,
like, splashes mud...

or jumps the curb, he can push
the woman out of the way.

You know what I'm saying?
Okay. [Chuckles]

Yeah.

Oh, uh, I I
We're here.

It's your house.
Yeah.

You can go inside now.

Um, thanks for
walking me home.

Well, good night.

You know, uh, allow me.


You are such a gentleman.
My Big Al.

Me and you. B.F.F.?

B.F.F.?

"Best friends forever."

Are you okay?

I'm fine. I had no business
going to that party.

I should have never listened to Albert and
What is with you?

Ever since your grandpa passed away,
you're not the same.

<i>It's like you've given up.</i>

You know, the guys were just
trying to help.

I suppose you're right.

Well, at least you had a good time.

So, what's with you and Albert?

Oh. He seems nice.

Why don't we invite him
to the track meet on Saturday?

Um, I don't think Albert's
gonna be here on Saturday.

Where will he be?

Uh, I don't know.

Besides, the fewer people
who see me run, the better.
Doris...

<i>you've got to start</i>
<i>believing in yourself.</i>

You used to be one of the fastest
runners on the team.

Good night, Lauri.

<i>##[Continues]</i>

## [Stops]

Good night.

<i>[Fat Albert] Morning, Doris.</i>
Hey, Doris!

<i>[Mushmouth Mumbling]</i>
Rudy says that you're mad at us. Are you?

<i>No. It wasn't your fault. I should have</i>
<i>known better than to go to that party.</i>

Wait. You guys haven't
been here all night, have you?

No. We just got here a little early. We didn't
want to miss goin' to school with you.

I see.

Look, you guys, I don't think you should
go to school with me.

I think people
are getting suspicious.

<i>Uh, well, that that's cool.</i>
<i>Yeah. We understand.</i>
Yeah.

<i>Um, is Lauri home?</i>

<i>No. She had an early class.</i>

<i>Are you guys okay?</i>
<i>You look a little... pale.</i>

A little washed out.
Washed out?

<i>Well, I don't know. Anyway...</i>

if you guys get bored, there's a park,
like, two blocks that way.

So I'll see you later on.
2:30. Showtime.

<i>I knew it.</i>
<i>She's right. We are fading.</i>

<i>Stop worrying. I mean,</i>
<i>we can't do anything about it anyway.</i>

We have to wait until 2:30.

Oh, thank you.

She taught me how to say balloon.
Balloon!

Well, I'm very happy for you.

Come on, honey.

Sweetheart, how many times
have I told you not to talk to strangers?

He's not strange, Mommy.
He's Mushmouth.

Goodup byebee.

Hey, man.
Look at Old Weird Harold.

<i>[Fat Albert]</i>
<i>He's shooting.</i>

Oh!
Ooh!

<i>[Bill]</i>
<i>He's dunkin'.</i>

Whoo!

<i>[Bucky]</i>
<i>And he's not falling.</i>

He's not clumsy anymore.

Mushmouth, you can speak.
Don't call me Mushmouth.

Uh, what should we call you?

Just call me... Mouth.

Don't call me
Old Weird Harold anymore.

I'm Air Harold now.

<i>[Bucky]</i>
<i>Ooh.!</i>

Dumb Donald.
Hmm?

What are you doing here?
We've gotta go.

I'm readin' AfricanAmerican history.
I'm on volume 22.

But I thought you were dumb.
Well, that's when I was a cartoon.

I'm actually feeling
pretty smart now.

And I bet I'll feel even smarter
without this dumblookin' hat.

Oh, you've got a nice face.

I do?

I do!
I have a nice face!

No. Shh. No.
Everybody, look! I got a nice face!

No. I'm so sorry. Shh!
Everybody, I have a nice face.

No! Dumb Donald!

My name is Mouth.

What'd I just say?
Your name is Mouth.

Isn't this great?
You understand me.

I do believe I like it
out here very much.

Me too.
Me three.

Hey, man. What's up?
Hey. Nice outfit.

Yeah, I figure, with this new hot look,
be getting all the girls.

<i>I hear you, man. Somethin'</i>
<i>I been living with for years.</i>

Hey, man, your colors.
They're fading.

You need to chill with that bleach,
man. I'll see you later.

Oh, no.
What's wrong?

It's gettin' worse.

We're not just losing our color.
Look at my hand.

I can see through it.

<i>It's fading away.</i>

I'm scared.

I wanna go home.
Me too.


Oh! My goodness.

Oh, my.
I can see his behind.

My behind?

So that's what one looks like.

Looks like it's broken.

Let's go.
We have a problem to fix.

Uh, surround him.

<i>We can't let anybody</i>
<i>see his behind.</i>

I told y'all. We gotta get back
to where we belong.

Let's go.

[Fat Albert] To the junkyard.


<i>You come back here, you.!</i>

Get over here!
I'm not done with you yet!


<i>[Grunts]</i>

Come out of there,
you little thing, you!

[Growls Softly]
Okay by me.

I can stay here
until the show starts.

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

[All Laughing]

And then we're playing buckbuck.

All my guys against you.

<i>And when we beat you,</i>
<i>all this will be ours.!</i>

Ours! Ours!

Oh, man!

Now he has a green
naked behind.

What are you doin' here?

Dumb Donald.

You have a face.
Isn't it nice?

Great. He's got a face.
Now let's go.

The show's already started, and you guys
gotta get your behinds back in the TV.

But no looking.
At what?

Never you mind.
Just no lookin'.

I have never seen anyone
move so slow.

Hurry up.
The show's almost over.

<i>Well, we we</i>
<i>Why you trying to squeeze me?</i>

Help! Fat Albert,
you gotta help!

They're gonna
take over our show.

Okay, Russell. We're comin'.
Okay, Bucky, come on. You first.

Since you got the youknowwhat
hanging out.

When I count to three...

close your eyes.

Three!

They're back! They're back!
My pants are back!

Yeah, but you're still Bucky.

[All Laughing]

Well, I'll be glad to get back
where I can take it to the hole.

Uhoh!
<i>Dominate in the paint and score at will.</i>

All right, Harold.
<i>[Rudy] You're the man, Harold.</i>

Hey, boy, pull your pants up.

Okay, who's next?
<i>[Dumb Donald] I'll go.</i>

I've become smart enough
to understand that we're fading away...

because we've entered into a world
where we do not belong.

If you try to become
something that you're not...

you lose the essence
of who you really are.

Then go. Go.

Oooh, eyeballs! Eyeballs!
Floating eyeballs!

Where is your face, man?
<i>[Doris] What happened to his face?</i>

<i>He always wore a hat in the cartoon,</i>
<i>so nobody ever drew him a whole face.</i>

<i>[Bucky] Put the hat on,</i>
<i>Dumb Donald.! Put the hat on.!</i>

Ah, that was a close one.

Well, well, well. Interesting, right?
Yeah.

All right.
Well, who's next?

How about you?

Oh, uh, I've decided,
uh, I'm gonna have to stay.

<i>[Bill] No, you're not.</i>
No. You're not.

<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you a special news broadcast.</i>

No! You missed it again.

<i>[Fat Albert] Hey, hey, hey.</i>
<i>We can make it another day.</i>

And how do you know?
Have you ever faded before?
Oh, we'll be fine.

You don't care if we're fine.

All you care about
is staying here with Lauri.

Lauri is important to me.

Maybe it's time I started
caring about myself.

I don't even know
who you are anymore.

Hey, hey, hey.
I said I'm gonna stay.

Hey, hey, <i>hey.!</i> Friends
don't let friends fade away.

Don't use my lines on me. Besides,
I haven't solved Doris's problem yet.

But I don't have a problem!

Yes, you do!
No, I don't!

You think I came out of the TVjust for you
to tell me you don't have a problem?

I'm fine!
You were watching a happy, fun TV show.

Stop it! Stop it! This isn't
about her problem! It's about yours!

Hey, guys.

Oh, hi.
<i>Hi, Lauri.</i>

Where are the rest of the guys?
They went back.

In the tele Ow!

<i>[Lauri] I got some free passes</i>
<i>for the fair tonight.</i>

Albert, do you want to go?

That would be fantastic.

How about you, Doris?
Will you come?

I don't know.

Please?

Okay.

I just need tonight.
Just one night.

One last night with Lauri.

<i>Well, I'm gonna meet you</i>
<i>at the girls'house.</i>

I told Lauri I'd
pick her up at the library.

I feel really bad for him.

Let's make his last night here
one he'll always remember.

How about one
all of us will remember?

<i>[Bill]</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

Well, we're gonna
need some wheels.

I mean, we've got to ride
to the fair in style.

<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

[Girls Laughing]

Ladies, your chariot awaits.

It's okay.

Rudy, have you lost your mind?

Albert

Uh, you mean start it up?

Yep.

<i>[Bill Making Engine Noises]</i>
Doris.

This is all...
just a little joke...

<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

This is so much fun.
And thanks for winning this for me.

Hey, hey, hey.
Anytime, any day.

These have been two
of the greatest days of my life.

How come Fat Albert and Rudy
have girls, and I just have you?

Are you sure they
don't want something?

Oh, they don't eat.
I mean, they don't eat much.

Albert sure looks like he eats.

So, um, are you ready
for the track meet tomorrow?

Do you think they're sick?

<i>They look kind of washed out to me.</i>

No. No, that's just too much
bleach in their clothes.

Hey, Albert, if you like Lauri,
you gotta take her on a roller coaster.

That's the best thing to take a girl on,
because while the ride is goin' on...

they get so scared,
they want you to hold 'em.

And then when the roller coaster
goes around the corner...

they fall up against you
and everything. [Laughs]

Okay, watch me.

Okay, say you're a girl
and you're on a roller coaster.

I'm not sayin' I'm a girl
on a roller coaster.

What's wrong with you, man?
Why don't you say <i>you're</i> a girl
on a roller coaster by yourself?

I'm just tryin'
to show Albert something.

<i>Where'd Albert go?</i>
Oh, he he's with the girls.

Lauri, you wanna go
on the roller coaster?

Sure.

[Sighs, Chuckles]
Go, Albert.

[All Screaming]


[Muttering, Screaming]

Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

If I didn't have to go back

I mean, if I was
a real person, would you

Would I what?

Would you go out with me?

Yeah.

But we are on a date.

That's right. Cool.

You were so scared.

I wasn't scared. I just looked scared...
Mmhmm.

'cause my cheeks were
wrapped around my ears...

and my eyelids went up
over my head and everything.

Wanna go again?
Um, yyou go ahead.

Mm.

Be right back.

<i>You're Fat Albert.!</i>
Hey, hey, hey.

What are you doin' here?
You're supposed to be on TV.

<i>These bad kids</i>
<i>keep chasing Russell.</i>

He needs you.
We all need you.

<i>What will Mr. Cosby think</i>
<i>if you don't go back?</i>

<i>Come on, Emmitt. We gotta go.</i>
Dad, it's Fat Albert!

Uh, come on, son.
Mom's waiting.

But, Dad, it's really Fat Albert.

<i>I know. I know.</i>
<i>Who's Fat Albert?</i>

I think this is the real thing.

He's charming, bright,
a gentleman.

<i>And he's the first guy</i>
<i>I've met in a long time...</i>

<i>I feel I can trust.</i>

The kind of guy that
will always be here for me.

<i>It's Fat Albert.</i>

Yeah, right.

Hello. I'm looking for Mr. Cosby.

Are you his dad?

I'ml'm Fat Albert.

Whoa! Uh Help! He

I'm sorry, Mr. Cosby.
I didn't mean to startle you.

You okay?
No, that's all right, son.
Thank you. My boy...

how did you get
into this predicament?

Well, III crawled out of the TV set.

Crawled out of the TV set.
Uh, well, how?

II crawled out of there
because I heard her crying.

Who Who'd ya heard?
I heard Doris.

Doris.
She was sitting on the
couch, and she was crying.

Doris who?
Doris Robertson.

Doris Robertson?

Yeah.
Do you know where they live?

Uh, North Philly.

Oh.

Albert Robertson...

is Doris Robertson's grandfather.

He died some time ago.

I designed your character
after Albert Robertson.

And you heard her spirit...

and you crawled through the set?

I I guess so.
Well, that's just fine, son!

All you have to do is you
just crawl back into the set.

I don't want to go back into the set.
We're ready to go.

Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, hey, hey, hey. I want to stay!

Oh, ho, ho. No, you can't do that.
See, you're a cartoon.

You're a cartoon, and you have your fellas
waiting for you to do more stories.

Your fans are waiting to see you
on TV so you can solve problems.

Oh, no, I don't want
to go back into the TV.

What do you mean,
you don't want to go back?

No, I want to stay here in the real world.
You can't

You can't stay out here.

You stay out here...

you're gonna turn
into celluloid dust.


Lauri.
Albert?

<i>What are you doing here?</i>

Uh, I need to talk to you.

I'll meet you downstairs.

Oh, Lord.


<i>Oh, my.</i>
Lauri [Groans]

Albert?
Are you okay?

Hey, hey, hey.
Fallin' is easy.

It's gettin' up
that's the hard part.

Now just roll me over. No. Don't take me.
Okay.

Grab onto my Oh!
You're tickling me. [Laughing]

[Mutters, Grunts]

Whoo. Ahh.

So, what's this about?

Uh, well, I came here
to tell you...

that I can no longer
be your B.F.F.

I can only be your B.F.U.T.
B.F.U.T.?

Yeah, "best friend until tomorrow."

What are you talking about?
All right, I don't just look like Fat Albert.

I <i>am</i> Fat Albert.
So?

I'm really the guy in the cartoon.
Cartoon?

The <i>Fat Albert</i> show.
You know, "hey, hey, hey."

It's a cartoon.

See, when I told you
I would stay forever...

I didn't know that I was fading.

Now I'm this fading
cartoon character...

and if I don't go back into the TV...

I'm gonna turn into a big pile
of powdered celluloid.

You know, it's almost funny.

Every time someone says
they care about me...

they wind up leaving me.
No, no, Lauri.

Wait. No, Lauri. Lauri!

You You can't let fear keep you
from caring about someone.

Albert.
Yes?

Get some help.

Wa Lauri, wai
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

How could you possibly believe
that Albert's a cartoon character?

It's all true, Lauri.

Doris, no one came out
of our TV set.

<i>Those guys, Albert's friends...</i>

<i>they're very strange.</i>

I think they could be
some kind of cult.

Someday you'll understand.
<i>What I understand...</i>

is that we have a track meet
tomorrow, so let's go to sleep.

And then they won't
laugh at me anymore.

Hey, Fat Albee!
I mean, Fataboo!

Aw, frit!

<i>Well, Doris, if I ever come</i>
<i>back out of that TVagain...</i>

I'll be calling you.

I'll be waiting.

<i>[Fat Albert]</i>
<i>Okay, Bill, you're next.</i>


Arthur, learn the handshake.

Why don't you go first?
I just need a moment alone with Doris.

See you in the junkyard.

Hey, Russell, you know what?
I'm actually happy to see you.

Oh, yeah? Well, I'm still
telling Mom on you.

Well, uh, I guess I have to
go back to the way I was.

But if I could stay,
I would be so happy...

to be the best that
I was capable of being.

It's funny.
It seems like I know you

have known you...
for a long time.

Maybe you have.
Maybe you have.

All right. Come on now.
We gotta get you back to the track.

[Clears Throat]
You got a relay race to run.

Go for it.

<i>Come on, Fat Albert.!</i>
<i>We need you.!</i>

<i>[All Encouraging]</i>
No, not yet.

I finally understand
why I had to come out here.

Don't. You won't be back in time.
You cannot last another day.

I have to help her.

It's time for Doris
to believe in herself again.

<i>[Bill]</i>
<i>You're fading, man.! You cannot</i>

[TVTurns Off]

[TVTurns Off]

<i>Guys, listen up.</i>

Now, we win this relay,
we win the meet. All right?

Yori, you're first leg as usual.
All right.

Lisa, I'm taking you off of third leg
and putting you on second leg.

Okay.
Go, Lisa!

Lauri, you're third leg.
And, Doris, you're anchor.

<i>All right, come on.!</i>
<i>Let's do this now.!</i>

Go, Archers!

<i>Yeah, come on, guys.!</i>

Anchor? But you're always anchor.
How could Coach make me anchor?

Lauri!
It was Albert's idea.

You're not a loser.

Come on.

<i>[Cheerleaders Shouting, Indistinct]</i>

<i>We've got spirit.!</i>
<i>Yes, we do.!</i>

<i>We've got spirit.!</i>
<i>How about you?</i>

[Grunts, Sighs]

We won! We won!
You did it!

No, <i>we</i> did it.
[All Cheering]


Oh, come on. We gotta go.

Where are we going?

Oh, Albert,
you never should've come.

What's going on?
I have to get him in the TV
before the show ends.

Doris, don't start.
Can't you see he's fading?

So we meet again.

Fat Albert.

Reggie, leave him alone.
He's not, uh, feeling well.

Hey, everybody, listen up!

<i>This fat fool is not</i>
<i>what he appears to be.</i>

<i>Come on, Albert.</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, where
do you think you're going, fat man?

It's you and me.

[Groans, Gasps]

Hey, hey, hey.
Get out of our way.

Okay.

<i>So I guess you won't mind</i>
<i>if we borrow this.</i>

Anything you want.

Come on.
Doris, I don't know about this.
Wait, Doris. Lauri.

Are you sure
we should be on this? Oh!

Look, Lauri! Doris! Lauri!

Doris! Whoa, stairs.
Hey!

<i>Stand back.!</i>

[Both Scream]
Whoa! Whoa!


Oh, sorry.
I just can't stop. Sorry.

[Woman Screaming]
[Man Grunts]

Nice meeting you.
Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, whoa, whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!

Ow!
[All Gasping]

So sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. So sorry.
[Woman Screams]

Oh, thank you.

<i>Whoa.!</i>
<i>[Woman Screams]</i>

Hello.
No, no, no!

<i>[Fat Albert Yelling]</i>
[Woman Screams]

Hey, yo, man!

[Screams, Grunts]

Are you okay?


Hey, hey, hey. Flyin' is easy.

Ilt's the landing that's hard.


Fat Albert!

<i>Hurry.! The show's</i>
<i>almost over. We need you.</i>

Okay, Bill. I'm comin'.
Now get back in the set.

Pretty amazing, huh?
How could this be?

Hurry up. You've gotta go.

Albert, wait.

I don't understand any of this.

I never meant to hurt you, Lauri.

Will you ever come back?

If there's any way that I can, I will.

But in the meantime, we'll
always have North Philly.

And I'll always have my Big Al.

Albert, wait!

I finally figured out
who you remind me of.

You remind me of my grandpa.

Hey, hey, hey.
That's a nice thing to say.

I love you, Doris.

I love you too.

<i>[Bucky On TV]</i>
<i>What is that? Apiece of paper?</i>

<i>[Bill On TV]</i>
<i>No, man. That's a paper clip.</i>

<i>[Fat Albert]</i>
<i>I'll see you girls through the TV.</i>

[Grunting Continues]
<i>We have 'em.! We're</i>
<i>the buckbuck champions.!</i>

<i>We still have 'em.</i>
Okay, lift. Okay, now push.

[Girls Grunting]

<i>Faaaat Albert.! He loves</i>
<i>to hear us call his name.</i>

Hey, hey, hey.
Who wants to play?

Oh, no!
[All Shouting]

<i>Fat Albert, you got</i>
<i>a problem to solve.</i>

<i>I just saw Danielle. She said she was</i>
<i>quittin'school and running away from home.</i>

Hey, Danielle.
What do you want?

You can't quit school and run away.
What's it to you?

Well, I care about you.
Well, don't.

Every time someone says they care
about me, they wind up leaving me.

<i>But, Danielle,</i>
<i>you can't let fear, um</i>

He better not be doing this again.

<i>You can't let fear keep you</i>
<i>from caring about someone...</i>

because caring about someone
is wonderful.

<i>Aperson you can think about,</i>
<i>and they think about you...</i>

and you both know you're
thinking about each other.

<i>And itit's just</i>
<i>fantastic to know...</i>

out there in the world...

Hey, hey, hey!

It's Faaaat Albert!

Grab his socks!
Let go of my legs! I gotta help these people.
