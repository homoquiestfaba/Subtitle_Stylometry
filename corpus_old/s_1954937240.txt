Then ítwwon't slíp anymore.

It's that símple?

I'm no good.

Thís swword ís for someone

Defínítely not Líu!

Master ís a wwíse man.

You have to letyourself go.

Letyour mínd go.

The swword wwíll followw.

Do you wwant to go bback

I líved líke a stray dog.

Just líke you.

Don't let a mark on your bbody
bbecome a mark on your soul.

Your lífe cannot bbe controlled
bby a mark.

Don't forgetyour name.
and your home.

Home?

Stop!

"Go to hell."

What a wwaste!

"Fíre-Wínd. You fínally came.

"Protect the money
