Oh, heck!

You lost a piece...

I can not think!

No excuse!

Let me concentrate!

Failed and dull.

So fast?

Are we going?

Come on...
What?

Come here!

Show me.

What?

Show me that
you want me!

What do you want me to do?

Leave it.

Michael!

Excuse me, Melody.

Go!

Melody was not very fit!

Oh yes?

Tell me what
has happened...

I broke up with her
today.

It was getting too serious.

You know I do not like that.

Why?

Melody is a classy girl.

Yeah...

She is gentle, thoughtful, sensitive,

the perfect house mistress!

What?

Are you looking for
a cowhide?

No...

Something...
Anything.

-Something more.
Like what ?

I do not know.

I want someone who is exceptional.

Are you Michael Morgan?

to introduce myself.

Great!

Michael Morgan
Suzanne Braunhill

Nice name!

It means "well... rolled" in Gaelic.

You wear it
very well.

Good. I think
we will meet again.

Miss Braunhill!

Your keys!

Are you free,
after your job?

No!

I do not believe it!

This girl, she is...

uh...

you must see it!

Wait a minute,

Do you know her?

That's right, you worked
at the New York branch!

She only has problems, Michael.

Big problems.

What do you mean?

You can believe me,
I know something.

You have nothing to do with this girl!

Where did she go, she dropped?

Listen to me, buddy,

This is a barracuda.

Hello?

Terry? This is Michael.
I wake you up ?

The devil never sleeps, Michael.

What do you want,
you move to New York?

No thanks, Terry!
This is a lot cheaper here!

I wanted to ask you questions about Suzanne Braunhill.

Ah, that's it...

She has already done hers?

No, why, is
a bad ad agent?

No, she is excellent,
but I had to fire her.

She is formidable,
is everything,

she put a lot of guys down!

But it's only for the top?

No... no.

This is not my type.

She's paid a jerk.

We were all very happy
when she had her transfer.

She's a little too much
for you?

For you too, Mickey.
You want to bet ?

= $ 1000.

It works.
OK, Mike.

Anything else?

Yes. Do you have a personal file?

Yes, of course.

<i> Why are you so in a hurry?
This is the first date! </ I>

Enter!

This is the only thing I did not do last night.

Excuse me?

You are really
a case, you know that!

I know why you
have frightened them all!

Mr. Morgan... how can I help you?

Ah, I understand! No plans
during work, is that it?

I have research
to do before the meeting.

So, if you do not have a query about the agency,

I have to go.

Hey, Nick...
Nick!

Wait for me!

Are we going to have a drink tonight?

No, thanks,
I'm too busy.

What is the problem, Nick?

Are you going out with her?

Yes... an appointment!

Do not do that, Michael.
Do not do that !

You really cracked
for her, huh ..

She's going to make you live things that you've never experienced before.

She'll make you turn into jerk, use you...

and dump you!

I'm sorry, Nick.
Really, OK,

but it's not going to happen to me!

I do not know
what is the worst:

the idea that she will destroy you, too

or the idea that she does not do it.

We need to talk about distance and precision.

No Listen to this:
"Services and golf".

The Pacific specialist?

America. That's what is sold in Japan.

American sports,
American golf.

Have fun
with Kenzai balls.

OK... America,
Anna?

I would like...
balls!

And what else,
our psychologist?

Men in Japanese business.

Competition,
competitiveness.

Take the advantage!

Good!
This is more American!

It's not going to touch them.

But the balls are Japanese...

Better yet!

The Japanese mastery,
and the image of America ..

Our balls are
unbreakable!

Who has unbreakable balls?

Ah, well, our new recruit, Suzanne Braunhill,

you know everything
the world, Suzanne?

I think so.

Hello, Nick!

So, Michael, are you
who found this client,

Can you briefer Suzanne?

They are looking for
an American box.

Why?

They are interested in
the American market.

For balls?

Yes, bullets.

I think the American side

will please them a lot.

They are looking for something that could propel them

at the level of
competition here in the USA.

This is a big box, at home,

But here in America,

great...

great...

loose the giants!

I think this idea of competition will be

very good for them.

It's my turn!

What do you mean?

That I want to take you,
just us two.

Do not say things so horrible!

Please, let me go!

Where am I?
Right here...

Monte!

Take care!

And do not do the naughty.

Sir, do you
call yourself how?

You can call me
sir.

Yes sir.

I want
to take off your blouse.

S Please,
not that, sir!

Do what I say!

S Please, do not hurt me!

I will not do anything to you,
if you are obedient.

You'll be a nice girl, and take off your skirt.

You are a good girl.

My panties too, sir?

No
Not immediately.

Do not defend yourself!

What should I do, sir?

I want to take a bath.

What do you do to me, sir?

We do not speak
without permission!

I can get up,
Sir?

No

But... I have a gift
for you!

Can I search for it?
Not now !

Please, please!
It will please you!

Agreed,
but hurry up.

Close your eyes.
Close your eyes !

Now
counts up to 10.

Say it! 10...

No fears... The
3rd time, it's good!

And... shit!

Hello?
Suzanne?

I need you to testify for me.

Who is it?

Suzanne,

let me out here!

What do I win, if I do it?

Sorry, the game is
finished today!

Michael...
Do not ask questions!

No need!

She started to manipulate you, is that it?

It's like a drug,
Michael, you're addict!

Listen, I manage everything
that, agree?

I can play his game.  Sharon wants to see you.

Nick!

Do you have the air,
I ask for a coffee?

No, that's fine.

Have I heard that you spent the night in a cell?

Barely two hours.
The noises go fast!

They called to check your schedule.

In decent terms,

can you explain what you were doing?

I just took a bath.

How much time do you need to complete

A week, I just have some research to do.



I just got a fax from Kobe.

He's in the plane,
he wants a quote tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

Where are the projects?
Images ?

Do your research,

in 24h we need
a product that sells!

Yes sir.
... Mrs !

Do not let me fall, Michael!

OK, Sharon.

No, I told you that I needed...

Alexei...

I want all the team
Kenzei in my office.

Am I...
Quick, Kobe is coming tomorrow!

Do you check that all
prices are mentioned?

OK,
I see with Larry.

At what time do we see each other tomorrow?

Early, at 9:00.

Suzanne, can I show you something?

Uh... yes!
Thank you.

This is Michael.

How are you? Do you need help with Kobe?

No, Terry, I need help
about Suzanne Braunhill.

Ah... So,

she's winded up,
is that it?

This is for the $ 1000?

I want to know how to do it,
what is its weak point.

She does not have any.

There must be
something,

money...
a promotion...

She has ambition, but
she is not stupid,

she is waiting for her turn.

A secret council?

She only likes the game.  Terry...

Do you have it...
No. No...

Mike... Barracudas
do not stay together.

Uh, Terry...
I have to leave you.

You were an ugly
girl last night.

I do not play anymore.



Have you ever learned that you do not play the same game again?

Everything is a game for you?

All that is exciting.

But that does not give you
the right to...

What?

To excite more than you've been in all your life,

that's what you wanted!

Come on, you do not want me
anyway not

because we did not fuck
at our 2nd meeting!

And then, I said...

the third time is
the good!

What is
the rules of the game?

For you to find out,
it's part of the game!

But they change
all the time.

It's also part of the game.  Look at me.

Kiss me.

I'll tell you a rule:

If you do not play,
you are eliminated.



Eliminated, like Nick.
You understood ?

Yes leader.

Michael, Michael!
I have a great book!

Zen, and golf.

Ah, well, I'll take it later!

No, no, I have it here.

By Carrie Heather.

Good job.

I'll put it away,
Michael.

Thank you.

Thank you, Alexei.
This is easy to read

Pay attention.

Where do you bring me?

Where are you, amens, mistress?

Where are you, amens, mistress?

Let me look at you.

Not bad...

So, Michael,

Do you want
to make you love?

Yes...

What?

Yes, mistress.

Good boy.

Stay calm.

Remove that smile
from your face.

Mistress...

What?

I have to go to the bathroom.

Come on.

Go!

I can not!

No apologies!

I'm so excited!

Why?

Good boy.

Are you ready,
to take me?

Close your eyes.

Where are you going?

A plus.

But I have work!

No, not today!

Suzanne!

If you shout loud enough,
someone can help you.

If that's what you want.

Shit!

OK.

The golfer hits
the golf ball.

The course changes to
baseball field,

The ball flies
over the stands,

and disappears.

Type a "home run" with
Kenzei golf balls.

OK, good!

Where is Michael?

He should not be here?

Ah... yes!
I'm sorry,

I forgot to tell you, he did not feel well.

Oh... he must be in bed.

Leave him, Suzanne.

Give up,

stop tormenting him!

I will play with you.

This good Nick...

You know Michael is...

twice as much player
as you?

I think he's going to get there.

I missed you?

Slut...
Oh!

Oh! This is bad!

You must've felt
dropped, huh?

We continue the game?

I guarantee you that you will love him, this one.

Are you thirsty?
Yes mistress.

Would you do anything for me?

I will play all your games, mistress.

You were great!

Do not worry, we never play the same game again.  OK. Have all the documents been prepared?

Oh no!
No ?

Of course!

Suzanne,

the room is ready?

Yes, it is done.

Michael, did you read
the book?

Which book?

Zen in Golf.
Zen in golf!

This is a great book,
Alexei. Thank you.

Michael?

These ideas are commonplace.
This is too...

Stick to that,
Miss Braunhill.

The chips! Kobe loves
onion chips!

We are busy...

Michael,

we are ready!

OK.

I leave for the airport.



I'm coming with you.
Me too.

What's hot!

Are you hot?

Yes, yes.

It's better...

What, Nick?

Where do you look?

Do you want me?

Suzanne...

Do not you want to share me, Michael?

Nick did not want to.

C & rsquo; was a little pig.

That's why
you lost me.

But...

You like to share me,
right, Michael?

Species of... slut!

You are only a slut,
without any feeling!

Nick!

What is your problem?

Stop it!

My hero!

I think
I'm in love...

See you this afternoon, around 3:00 am, Mr. Kobe?

Will you also attend the
presentation, Miss Braunhill?

Yes, but Mr Morgan
is the manager.

I am only his slave!

Do you need something
, Mr. Kobe?

Can someone help me to record?

Yes, of course.
Okay, Nick?

With pleasure.
This way, Mr. Kobe.

Sayonara.
Sayonara

Sayonara, Mr Kobe
Sayonara.

Sayonara.

<i> I'm only his slave... </ i>

I thought Nick would die!

You were cow
with him.

This was to amuse me.

Kobe is here?

We negotiate tomorrow?

That tells you, to wear luck?

What, now?

Yes...

Yes?
Hello, driver.

Hello, how are you?
Good and you ?

Good, very good.
What is your name ?

Claudio.
Claudio Cabrero.

Ah, did you hear, honey?

C & is a foreign name?

Yes, it's Mexican.
Mexican?

This is Mexican, darling.

Do you have family,
children?

Yes I have two children,
a girl, a boy,

my little girl
works well...

This is great.
Where do you live ?

In Hollywood.

And you like your job?

I love my job.
This is great,

I see nice people.

Welcome to our
West antenna!

Where is Mr. Morgan?

In the meeting room, he
prepares everything for you.

Then I will also
make an effort.

This is your honor, Mr. Kobe.

They are there?

They arrive.
Go get them.

Do you like it?

So,

you have not spoken
of the whole week!

I could at least
have an explanation?

Now, uh...
We'll talk tonight.

I have the right to be better treated from you!

Better treated?

We tried, it did not work. That's all!

I'm sorry, I'm not sure when...

i would have had.

What did I do?

No one has ever treated me like that before!

This is not you,
it's me...

This is me.

You are a great girl.

But you're not what I'm looking for.

But what do you want?
I could change?

Melody, do not take it
not against you!

You are nice, attentive,

I want you to find yourself
someone who will appreciate that.

Mr. Kobe wanted to see where the fireworks will take place!

All right, I think
you'll love # 8.

Kenzei...
Mr Kobe,

I have the impression that these ideas do not please you too much.

Well,

I'm listening.

What is the competition that is stressing you?

Yes.

After all,

in Japan,

no business man,

same Keratsyo,

would not want to go to a golf club.

This is right?

Yes, that's right.

Business in Japan,

golf,

philosophy

are questions
of control,

good positioning,

clarity of mind,

individual excellence.

Exactly like the
Kenzei golf balls.

<i> Kenzei Golf Balls: </ i>

<i> because golf is the ultimate game of the spirit. </ i>

Hi!
Hello.

I have a reward for
our success tonight...

This is Steffanie,
my friend from L.A.  Happy birthday,
Mr. Morgan.

Michael. This is not
my birthday.

When I'm done with you, you'll think so.

Do you have any habits you want to talk to me about?

Uh... I snore
when I sleep.

You are not going to sleep.

What do you say,
can we start?



I feel...

you know...

Do you join us?

I think I'll...
just watch you.

You are beautiful, Steffanie...

You are beautiful!

I adore when you
kiss like that.

I will help you.

Ah, you too...

I made the idiot.

What did you do?

What did I do?

A bit of everything.

Cocaine? Heroin?

Like the good old days, Mike.

This is because of Suzanne, huh?

I do not want
your pity...

Nick,

This is crazy!

How did you let a woman do this to you?

Yeah...

I still have a few cigarettes.

I stopped.

Try with Melody,
damn it!

Michael!

Stay away from
Suzanne!

I manage.

We can not!

I do not want to!

I do not want you to make her happy!

I'm sorry, Nick.
Sorry...

I like it.

You are sick...

I'm tired, Mike.

Mike...

We are no longer friends.

How are you?

Excuse me?

I said hello!

Do we know each other?

What?

Do we know each other?

I do not believe!

We may have been seen in a past life.

Maybe you owed me money in a past life?

Maybe you
was a favor?

How are you called?

I do not have a name.

Does it tell you to dance?

Do you know what?

I have a theory.

I know how
men make love

their way of dancing.

Just see
Michael Jackson,

it must be a
fucking guy!

61...

Very good choice!

You've already made love
with a stranger,

huh?

The instinct...

He does not know what you want.

He could kill you.

I could kill you.

Hello, darling.

Hello.

Slavery,

or Asian torture?

Breakfast
near the pool.

Last night...
No, chttt...

Nobody...
nobody... me...

It's like you're
in my brain!

Seriously!

Nobody has ever
played this game like this!

No one has ever understood me.

I love you, Michael.

I like you.

I love you, Michael...

I like you.

As I like you...

Hey! Where are you going ?

I'm taking
all day!

What am I going to do without you?

Have a drink
and wait for me!

Slut!

Hello, my love.

He left?

Who?

Kobe.

That's what I can do for the agency.

But you said that
you loved me!

What?

What is it,
for you, fidelity?

What are you talking about?

I'm talking to you about what happened this morning.

This was a game!

A game?

Come on, my love,

do not get angry
against me!

You are strong!
You are really strong !

The best that I knew!

I have a surprise
for you!

Normally, I never replay
the same game, but

This is not all the same thing.

OK?

What are your wishes, master?

What are we going to do for the master?

Melody, why are you doing this?

To give you what you want!

Michael!

To please you!
I love you, Michael!

Play the game, Michael!

But all is not
a game!

Suzanne says that...
Do you know the rules?

You are the rules,
or you are eliminated.

She says that you have to...

Can you respect
people without hurting them?

We are all adults!

Maybe
that you'll love me...

I gave you

more passion than you'll ever have,

in your little life.

Do not go,
Michael.

Michael, if you're going, it's over.

Please, Michael...

Reception...

Nick Kelso, please.
Room 515

I'm sorry, he does not want to be disturbed.

Do you want to leave him a message?

Uh... tell him

tell him...

Give up.

Hello?

Suzanne?

I'm sorry...

C is over, Michael.

I just...

I lost my pedals.
But it's better.

C is finished.

Do not remember me.
Who are you who wanted it?

You can not...

C & is the rule of the game:

you have given up,
and you are eliminated.

We do not play again.

Ask Nick!

Open!

You can not let me fall like that!

I called the police. In
2 minutes they will stop.

How are you!

Always your game,
your rules, your turn!

Because I know
what I want.

Which is not your case.

Suzanne, we do not play with that!

You do not have to give me lessons!

You do it without stopping!

Look Melody!

This is not the same!
Why not ?

<i> Both
of the same species </ i>

It's you who said it.

But your game
is not funny!

But I did not want to hurt her!

I was just looking for...
What?

Somewhat special?

Someone to whom to confront you?

Yes!

Suzanne...

That's exactly what I was doing!

And I thought that
you were the good...

and you do not have it.

Suzanne,
do not do that!

Michael, you had a chance.

Please, give me
a second chance

Go away!

Suzanne!

I beg you:

I like you!

And Melody likes you.

So what?

Please, Suzanne...

You are exactly
what I want!

But you, no!

Do not move anymore!
More than a gesture!

Hands in the air!

He tried to rape me!

It's 15h of jail.
You have a dirty head...

We must keep you here
if you do not understand!

Where is Mr. Morgan?

He has personal problems to solve.

The poor...
And Mr. Kelso?

Sick, I think.

A E-Media
you work too much!

Oh no,

I am sure that we can give you satisfaction, Mr. Kobe.

This is already done, Miss Braunhill.

And I'm happy to announce you...

Suzanne is busy with your bullets, Mr. Kobe?

I'm sure she worked on it well.

Have you tried
to type it?

C was good?

Michael!

Suzanne is very dedicated,
not true, Suzanne?

Mr. Morgan!

Have you drunk?
This is unfortunate.

Excuse me?

You must know
games

which she has never heard of!

Michael! Get out here!

Whatever you do,

never enter
in his game,

because she will know what you feel,

and she will go further.
Not true, Suzanne?

Michael!

You are fired.

I understand.
You have not drunk,

This is a heartache
of love.

I sympathize...

You forgot that.

McGarrett

Terry, it's Michael.

Morgan, you owe me $ 1000!

I'm going to move to New York.

Useless, Michael.

You broke
the first rule.

You gave a dirty picture of the agency.

Each his rules, huh!

That's it!

And you must follow them.

You have to stop
personal play.

Okay?
Recall later.

OK.

Hello?

Jerry! Hi, it's Morgan,
central office.

How are you,
Michael?

Well, thank you.

Listen,

I need a double key very quickly.

No problem!

Yes? Great, thank you, I'm here.

Hi!
Hi...

Me revoila...

I wanted to apologize,

for this story
and these fantasies.

Excuse me.
I'm late...

Goodbye.
Goodbye !

Nothing was real,

no one was real.

I understand.
It's okay.

No,
I hurt you.

You've done more harm to yourself, Michael.

Yes.

I have to go.
Goodbye...

Michael!

Call me!

OK.

Braunhill...

Did you like the gift that I left for you?

Not that with me!

Oh my god!

Disgusting!

Did you see Michael?

Michael Morgan?

No, why?

I do not know,
he left,

he was looking angry.

It does not surprise me.

He played a dirty trick!

Not to me. At the agency.

Yes.

But I wanted you to know that you do not want to.

Whether it's true or not.

Nick was right:

There is really no other way.

What do you want?

Get dressed!

What is
going to do?

I'll show you
something.

Do you remember this spa?

Yes.

This is the place where I said I liked you.

And I love you, Suzanne.

Me too I like you.

No need to lie to me!

You want to show me that
I do not deserve your love.

I do not even deserve to live...

Michael!

But I'm going to take
with me.

Michael...

Please...

Suzanne!
Suzanne, how are you?

How are you?
Yes.

Suzanne,

do you like me?
Yes...

Shit!

Kind of sick!
Not moving !

Where I shoot...

You can.
Michael, I'll shoot!

So go!

Do not force me,
Michael!

Nick was right.

Bastard!

It was my turn!
Yeah!

Oh, shit!
Aaaah!

Now we are
equal!

I said that I like to play!

It's over, Nick.

It never ends,
my boy.

I got it, Nick!

Did you get it?
Well done!

C is finished?

Yes.

This is never finished,
with her.

But it's over
between you, right?

Maybe...

Come on, come on!

You will see...

Go!

Not a gesture!

I said:
"Not a gesture"!

He can sleep!

What...
Get on your knees!

Get up and on your knees!

This is no matter what!

Do not you want to
break her peace?

No, it's a game!

Turn around!
This is just a joke!

Turn around!

The hands behind
your neck!

I arrest you for aggression.

What do you do?

I...
I have rights!

Like to rape
this woman?

Mickey!

I can call
Mickey, huh?

You must believe me!

Impossible.

Listen to me:

You'll be okay now,

stop bothering this woman, otherwise...

Or I make you
blow your head!

This is a murder!

Shut up!

No!

Hit! Asshole...

Now we are
equal!

Come, my love...

Mick, this is Jack,
your replacement.

He's great...

A plus, darling!

Rest!

Michael!
What are you doing?

Michael!

C is over!

No it starts!

What do you do?

One last game!

No!

We will play anyway!

I give up!

If you give up,

you are eliminated!

Winner: Michael!

Help!

Go!

Still?

Do you still want to play?

Now, tell me:

Who won the game?

I like you, Michael...
