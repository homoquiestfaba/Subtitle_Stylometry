Say, Sanders
take a water break.

Hey, they've got the power, and we got
the power too, right here on FM 109

Right now it's 54 big degrees,
in Downtown Santa Fe,

With a low tonight of 42 degrees,

It is 8:45AM...

You have plenty of
storage space, Mr. Kwan.

We know you could
use the extra money.

I'm not interested.

You don't understand.

I understand very well
what you people sell.

I don't want your drugs in my store.

Mr. Kwan...
-- Please, leave.

Hello?

Hey, Kim, it's me, Jeff.

Jeff?

I'm not done talking to you.

Get out of my store.

You're a very rude old man, Mr. Kwan.

Leave, now!

Kim... what?

what, what's going on?

Do you think I came here
to ask you a favor?

You should be more
respectful of our organization.

Kim?

You're going to work with us..

You have no choice.

See you later, old man.

It's the third time this week I had
to pick him up at the station.

I can't keep him in school,

His temper is getting worse, and worse...

I can't even talk to my own son..

IDK what the hell's wrong with him.

Hmm, he took his mother's
death pretty hard, Carl..

Kim, we all did.

He's the only one walking
around with a chip on his shoulder.

You don't see Adam
acting up like that, do you?

Adam is too young to remember Elaine.

All I know is he's headed
for some serious trouble.

I'm thinking of enrolling
him in a military school...

One that especialize in discipline..

doesn't sound so special.

Besides, we both remember
our experiences in the military.

Christ, Kim, it's not like
I don't love him anymore...

It's just, I cannot handle him.

There's another school he might try.

Instead of disciplilne.

it teaches self-discipline.

It might help Jeff control his...

... energy.

It's called Kenpo school.

It's not one of those
new hippie schools, is it?

No, Carl.

Old school.

2000 years old.

Jeff...

This is Master Lo.

Pass it down

Jennifer.

Kenpo is a combination
of ancient fighting techniques,

and modern scientific principles.

An unending flow of motion.

A force which can
overwhelm any attacker.

Every move creates a
specific reaction in your opponent.

Each reaction leads
you to your next move.

Every strike...

is a block.

Every block, a strike.

Each move flows into the next.

This logical

and sequential flow of action.

Is the essence of Kenpo.

Kenpo can be the most lethal
of the martial arts.

To control the power of Kenpo,

you must first control yourself.

Train you spirit,

as you train your body

developing inner strength

balance,

and harmony, as you learn.

A master of Kenpo

is more than an expert in karate.

He is a martial artist.

He is a master of himself.

Alright!

Yo, tinkerbell,

Off the field!

It's our field too, meathead!

Say what?

Let's just .. forget about it, ok?

No, no, no let's not forget about it.

Why don't you just do what I said?

Off the field
Or I'll shove that pole up your ass.

Try it.
-- Come on, let's go.

You're not going to let butthead
get away with it, are you?

Adam! I said let's go.

It's not worth it.
-- It's not worth it?

What's that supposed to mean?

It means he can kick your ass.

You can kick my ass?

With one foot.

<i> With one foot, Erickson!</i>

Let's go
-- We're not done

I think we are!

I guess, he'd rather play
with his pole then.

You little shit.

<i>What happened?</i>

<i>Over here.</i>

<i>Get up, man.
Get up!</i>

<i> What happened?</i>

<i>Call an ambulance. Now!</i>

<i>Amazing.</i>

What the hell you
think you were doing?

The guy hit Adam.

That's no excuse for what you did.

You tried to kill that kid.

I didn't!

By pure luck you didn't.

Had no goddamn idea what
you were doing, did you?.

were totally out of control, weren't you!

I sent you to Kenpo school
to control your temper.

And this is what you've learned?

You haven't changed.

The only thing that's different
is now you're dangerous.

I want you out of my house.

What do you mean?

Someday you're gonnal kill somebody
I don't want Adam around to see it.

I want you away from Adam.

He got hurt today because he's tryng
to proof to you how tough he is.

Cause he wants to be like you.

Well, he's not like you,

And I don't want him to be like you.

So you stay the hell away from him!
-- But, Dad.

I want you out of my house,

And I want you away from Adam.
Do you understand?

Yeah.

I'll just stay the hell away from everyone.

You have learned only half
of what I teach, Jeff.

You're strong, you're quick,

But you're only a tiger.

Not a dragon.

The tiger, does not think

Therefore, it can not act.

It can only re-act, respond.

The tiger is strong, and fearless

But it cannot initiate action.

That is the difference between
man and tiger.

Tiger is what I know.

The dragon is also very strong,

but full of wisdom.

The dragon fears...

... what it's strength can do.

This is the tiger.

This is the dragon.

The dragon always...

... has a choice.

The tiger .. never.

I have shown you the dragon,
but you have not seen him.

You will not find the dragon
in any dojo.

Experience will be your teacher.

You must find him for yourself...

... in your own way.

And when you do,
-- I know,

Then I will have learned the dragon.

Then...

... you will be a man.

Jeff
-- There's nothing here for me, Kim.

There is more here for you
than you can see right now.

Don't you start too, okay?

I know all about what I can't see,
and can't feel and can't learn.

Jesus

I'm sorry

You're the last person
I should be talking to like that

I'll miss you, Kim.

Wherever you are,
my heart will be with you

You have a lot of nice things here

Very old,

Very beautiful.

Cover the back

You're going to learn to work with us,
old man

Right?

Is there a problem here?

I guess so.

What's going on here?

You alright, Kim?

Better than they are

They could be worse.
-- Hey, Terminator,

IDK where you came from,
but you better go back.

These guys are Golden Fists.

You're a dead man.
-- Jimmy.

This is my friend, Jeff.

Go get the wood from out back, please

What are Golden Fish, Kim?

Soldiers for Korean mafia

I never heard of them before

You have never been Korean.

You know, Jeff?

Koreans come to America
because it is the greatest country.

They work hard,

save money,

become citizens,

Open businesses...

... like mine.

but...

Every ship brings rats
along with regular cargo.

Korean mafia comes to America too.

Drugs, prostitution, parasites.

I reject their drugs,

So they come and smash things up.

Maybe I should stick around a while,
see if I can change their minds, huh?

No
I appreciate your offer.

But you are an outsider.

They would think I have hired your for protection.

They think they're losing face

Tomorrow I'll go and talk to them.

Explain things, they'll understand.

It'll be okay

Jeff?

You look good.

It is nice to see you again
It's been such a looong time.

I missed you.

Kim...

Are you sure there's nothing I can do?

No need to worry

Everything will be fine.

It's like...

... nothing's changed here

Except, I am now one of my antiques

Tell me, Jeff.

Will you see your family?

Don't get up on my account

Young gun ho

Jimmy O.

Look, I'm going to go see Uncle Sam.

Are you gong to be arlight?
-- Yes, thank you.

Jeff and I have lots to talk about

Okay, good-bye

Jimmy's a good boy

He helps out

I let him stay here, when he need a place.

Doe he remind you of anyone?

Did I really have that much of an attitude?

You mean you don't, any more?

It's been a long day

I'll see you in the morning

Why don't you get some rest

I think I'm gonna get cleaned up
and maybe go for a walk.

Good night, Jeff.

Good night, Kim.

Jeff!

Yeah

It's never too late to come home

Yeah,

Kim...

No...

Nobody home, asshole

Except us

Give me your money, sucker!

You heard the man

I'm going to cut you, motherfucker!

Is this what you want?

Huh?

You want this?

You want my money?

You want it?
Take it!

Excuse me

Adam Sanders, Wilshire homicides
What do you have?

Korean mafia all the way
typically clean hit

Unless Forensics finds something,
we got diddly.

I'd like to work on he case

There is no case,
No one down here talks to the cops.

The victim...

... was a friend of mine.

A very close friend.
I'd like to work on the case.

Tell you what, you get my Lt's okay
it's fine with me.

I'll get it.
--  Detective! --- Yeah

So, put me in?

It's a signature execution
we've seen it before.

It's always connected to the Hiro-Pan network

Hiro-Pan?

Yes, methamphetamine.It's a
best-seller for the Korean mafia.

Who runs that stuff

I'd be the chief of the DEA
if I knew that  one

I'll tell you this, though.
whoever this guy is, he's smart.

I'll get you the records

Anything else

Yeah, male caucasian who found the body

Tell me again

Look, I told you four times already

You're going to tell me again and again...
-- It was around here yesterday

Show him the pictures
if you think it'll do any good.

Who knows?, he might recognize someone.

Anyways, he's all you got, Sanders
-- What?

Jeff?

Adam.

Oh, my God

I know this seems like a waste of time,
but .. you never know.

Other things, you know,
might turn something up

First one

Yeah

So where you going?

I thought .. ah .. we'd ..

.. might go see Dad

I got some things to care of

What things?
-- Don't ask.

Jeff, just hold on a minute

Look, just stay out of it, kid.
It's for your own good.

Jeff.
-- What?

Kim was family to me too, alright?

You cannot handle this by yourself

and what's more, If you try,
I don't care if you're my brother or not

I'm going to come down on
you like a ton of bricks.

Send my regards to Pop.

Excuse me

I'm looking for someone.
-- I can't help you.

Know anybody who can?

Guess not

Hi.

Wonder if you can help me

I'm looking for a guy

He's good in Tae-Kwon-Do

5'8", 150 pounds

Got a tattoo of a spider, right here

You know him?

Yeah

Great

I need to talk to him
Where is he?

Why don't you go home?
Before you get hurt?

I wonder if I can kick you ass?

No.

Not just you

All three of you

Are you serious?
-- Yeah

Are you?

I take on all three of you, you
point me in the right direction.

Deal?

Full contact

No protection

No problem

This is my dance

Come on, whiteboy!

Let's see what you got.

Come on

No.

Get up!

Get up

Where is he?

Forget it

We had a deal

Talk

Croc Pit

Where?

Croc Pit Club

He hangs out there

They all do

Thanks

Who said it never hurt to ask

Hello
-- Yes

I'm Detective Sanders.

I'd like to ask you some questions,
please

Yes?
-- Kim

He has a store across the street.

Cum?
-- Yes.

I'm investigating his ..

No
-- Yes

No. Mr. Kim...

I'm investigating his murder.

Moardar?
-- Yes.

I'd like to...

Murda.

Thank you for your time.

Keep the change.

Yes.

Have a nice day.

I canvassed a four square-block radius,

around Kim's store.

No one's saying anything.

Wish to god I was back on the street,
I could help you.

You got everything you need.
you just get these bastards.

Right, Dad. We'll get them.

What happened to you?

Rough night.

Woah, Jeff, woa

Not going to go anywhere
till you tell me about the kid.

The kid, Jeff.

The one you left out of your statement
the one that was living in Kim's apartment?

We have his clothes, we got prints
all over the place; we got not ID

Now, you're going to tell who he is

IDK... who you're talking about.

Hey, kid.

That was him, wasn't it?

Great, Jeff.

Thanks a lot, bro.

You just scared off the one lead I had.
the one lead i had!

Come on.

That kid is from the street.

He's never going to talk to a cop
I know.

You know shit, Jeff.

You know what you're doing?
you're helping those bastards get away.

Why don't you just go play with your badge?

Go do your little police academy bullshit

You know what?

Kim wouldn't even be dead
if you weren't back in town.

Did you know that?

You're the one that killed him, Jeff!

This is your goddamn fault!

You're going to shoot me, Adam?

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

You don't belong here, punk

Who killed Kim?

Fuck you.

Who killed Kim?

No!

Take him outside

Kim was a good man

He was a friend of mine

A very good friend

We spent many happy moments here,
in Koreatown

I want to help

What can you do?

I have some information

But not here

It's not safe

Come

Please

It is important

We can talk privately in here

Come

I was going to see Kim
on the day he died

We had a meeting

I could've made things right
for him, but ..

except that I waited too long.

And now .. my friend is dead

And I did nothing to help him

The man who murdered Kim...

... must be punished.

And the punishment must fit the crime

Tell me what you know

There are four Onjabus in Koreatown.

Mafia leaders

Anyone of the three could've done it

Ye Mei, ..  Otoko, ..  Wo Sam...

What about the fourth?

The fourth Onjabu is Yong.

How do you know Yong didn't do it?

Because I am Yong

And yet I can do nothing

Nothing

If the other Onjabus learn that I am
seeking vengeance for my friend's death

They would turn against me

There would be total war in Koreatown

Much blood would be shed

Too much blood

There is only one person...

... who could bring about justice without ...

... total war.

That is an outsider

Will you do this thing?

You just point the way

There's a man named Kai.

He's a soldier for hire

My people have heard him talking

I'm sure he knows the man
who ordered Kim's death

Where is this Kai?

We will find him

The man on the right

That's Kai.

Want to live?

A name

Wh ordered Kim's death?

Say it

Wo Sam.

I'm sorry, it's too dangerous

Wo Sam is very heavily protected

Besides, you don't know him

Wo Sam is an animal, if you ..
-- Hey.

We had an agreement

Wo Sam lives in the Cocoma Hotel

He owns it

Everyone there works for him

The whole top floor is his

The only way in to the top floor is by ..

... a private elevator.

From the garage to ..
to the penthouse

be careful

There are guards at the gate...

... and the basement. At the top.

He's surrounded at all times

Min?

You okay?

Anything happens to me

I'll snap your neck before
I hit the ground

You want money?

I don't want your money

You took Kim's life

Now I'm going to take yours

I did not

You may kill me, but I will not die
saying a lie.

Then, you'll just die

Leave him alone
-- Stay away

Let him go! What're you dong?

He killed Kim

No way, Sam was Kim's friend!

He's like my Uncle

Sam's been protecting me from Yong

Yong?

That's who killed Kim

Who lied to you?

Yong

A man tells you something

and you invade my home

try and take my life

in front of the eyes of my children?

He fingered a soldier named Kai.

Kai said you did it

Kai works for Yong

Is that right?

Why should I believe you
more than Yong?

EVerybody in Koreatown knows
Yong killed Kim, Dick!

Tracy

Think, Yong wants me dead,

But he knows it will start a war
that will destroy even him,

So he sends an outsider

An outsider who will do anything ..

... to avenge a friend.

he can never be blamed

No evidence, no proof

Just some crazy stranger

The pefect weapon
THE  P E R F E C T  W E A P O N

What will you do now?

... if I let you go?

Yong and I have
some unfinished business

And I will finish it

I'm going with you

Forget it!

No way. You're going to need my help
-- You're just a kid.

Who knows how to find Yong

No deal!
-- Excuse me

You must find Yong

... before he can leave for Korea

Take the boy.
he can help you find him.

You came to take my life

you leave with my blessing

and one of my people

strange deal.

So how many people have you killed?

None, kid

Come on, we're working together
you can tell me.

Is that what you're looking forward to?

Killing someone?

Aren't you?

I mean, as soon as we catch
this guy, what choice do we have?

Only one
-- You're lucky.

You're lucky Sam let me help you

I'm his fastest runner

I'm the fastest runner
this side of the Pacific Rim

I know, I've seen you run

Hey,

How come you took off from the funeral
like that, instead of helping me then?

I wasn't running from you, brainiac

I was running from Yong, he saw me

Look ..

Sam's tough enough, but Yong ..

He's heavy duty

Yakuza connections,

drugs and protection only

He's Koreatown's Hero-Pong hero

The mystery man

Nobody even knows where he lives

the only place for sure,
where I know he goes every day..

... his bank.

That's good enough for me

But you're not getting up on Tanaka.

Yong's bodyguard

Yong doesn't go anywhere
without him

Guy's built like goddamn Godzilla

And nobody gets near Yong
when Tanaka's around

That's for shit sure

don't swear, kid
-- What are you my mother?

Where is your mother?

Hey... we can split up
and meet back at the hotel, okay?

Yeah, but you still didn't
answer my question

She's dead, alright!

How old were you when she died?

None of your business

Kim was right

You do remind me of someone

I lost my Mom when I was ten

So we do have something in commom?

Hey round-eye?

Hey, the bank's
not open yet, Sherlock

Mind tell me where we going?

To talk to someone

Who?

A cop

What?

Relax

He's my brother

I want you to talk to him

Hey, I'm not talking to no cop

I want you to tell him you saw Tanaka
-- but I didn't

He doesn't know that

I want you to tell him you saw
Tanaka kill Kim, okay?

Then he's going to ask if you'll testify
to that, I want you to say, yes.

You're dumber than you look

I'm not going to no court
and talk to no cop, No way!

That wan't part of the deal.
you can drop me off right here.

Will you just listen to me for a minute?

If we tell my brother you saw Tanaka then he'll arrest
him in the bank before anyone knows what's happened

So what?

That puts Yong in the back of the limousine

... alone.

Maybe you're not as dumb as you look.

We're in position in the bank parking lot

You guys stay put until
the suspect is inside the bank

??? guys.  Do you copy?

<i>That's a copy, 1830.</i>

Jeff?

Yeah

You know when you wanted to do
this alone, by yourself?

I mean...

Just go find that bastard
who killed Kim

... just blow him away...

I wanted to do the same thing.

I know what you're feeling...

... and...

... I'm really ...

... glad that we're
doing this together.

I mean, I never thought
it'd turn out like this

and it's good

Wake up, dim-brains, there he is!

Target on scene

He's not stopping at the parking lot
he's headed for the drive-through teller

This is going down wrong
I'm going to pull along-side and take a look.

alright, Jimmy...

I want you to do exactly what I tell you

You stay down there, close the windows

because I don't want him seeing you
before you can ID him

Don't worry about it. He won't see me.

Are we there yet?
-- No

Ah Christ, lady

What's happened?
-- We're going to lose him.

Are we there now?
-- No, we're definitely not there now.

Come on lady, move it!

Okay, Jimmy.

Positive identification.

Seat-belts!

1830, suspect's made me

switching to xxx xxx

1830, officer needs assistance

187 suspect

Northbound on Harvard

Wow, this is cool!

Alright, little brother!

We're gong to get him, Jeff.

Oh shit!

Oh .. shit.

Shit ..

Freeze

Let me see your hands!

Now!

Put your hands on top of your head

Now, do what he said,  put them up!

Hook him up

Get back in the car

Stay in the car.
-- Oh, man!

Jeff...  Jeff!

Hold your fire

Disperse
-- I want him alive.

Yong!

Shit!

This taser's got
50,000 volts of electricity

On your knees,
let me see your hands

I'm going to light you up!

Adam!

Shit!

It's clear

Adam...  you're alright?

Of course I am

Alright, have the paramedics take a look at
this guy before I transport him out of here

And I'll hook up with you
later at the station

I need to tell you something

Did it, bro

We got him

I heard you did a nice job back there

You were gutsy

You would've done the same thing, Tim.

I don't know

How long you been on the job?

Five and a half months.

Don't worry
you'll be fine

Hey

Hi!

I messed up

You helped me out
I didn't come through.

I didn't help you, Adam.

Jimmy didn't see Tanaka do anything

I lied

I didn't know what Tanaka was ..

Except that he was muscle for
the guy that killed Kim

Yong

He gave the order

That was Yong's limousine

He was supposed to be in the back

I used you to get to Yong

I didn't want anything
to happen to you, Adam

I jut wanted Yong so bad

... I wasn't thinking

Christ, Adam, we're family

Yeah

We are

It's okay

So what about Yong?

Jeff,

you kill Yong,
you throw away your whole life

and Jimmy's

He looks up to you

Yeah, I know

Kim was trying to help him out

And you really think he
would want you to do this?

There's only one line
between us and them

And once you cross it ..

You can never come back

So, ahh .. how is he?

He'll be okay

Look, I gotta go

Hey, you watch yourself, son

Young's leaving the country tonight

He wants all the Hiro-Pong out of
the warehouse before the boat comes.

Tonight. San Pedro. Berth Sixty.

Make sure you're there.

I'll be there

Let's do it

Ah, man, come on.
What are we doing up here?

Checking things out

Come on-n-n

Let's go, let's rock 'n roll

Tell me everything you heard

I already did

Tell me again

Yong brings the stuff he makes
hiropong with down there okay(???)

There's guards and workers
all over the place

What about the inside?

It's like a factory

Lots of workers

A speed-boat comes out of this
big ship and he picks him up

Takes Yong wherever he wants to go

That's how he got out of the country
the last time cops tried to bust him.

I'll wait till night

You stay at the hotel

If I don't make it out.
-- You will.

Yeah ..

If I don't ..

You get a hold of my Dad

Captain Sanders

You'll be safe with him

When you get him

Kill him for Kim

Kill him for me.

ha, you believe it still works?

The boat should be here by now

We should go outside

Hey, you!

Hold this

Thanks

Break time, guys

Not to worry

We are prepared

Are you faster than a speeding bullet?

Try it, Superman.

I want you to try it

Come on

Come on!

I'm glad you dropped by

I was hoping you would
have a chance to say goodbye.

Thanks of  extending the
.. courtesy

Brains.

this way, Kai

This way

Wait, wait

Don't talk to me

Don't .. kill me

Punishment must fit .. the crime.

Who said that?

This is what it feels like
.. just before you .. die!

Get up

I really want to kill you ..

.. but you're not worth it

Hey, hey
-- That's alright, let him go.

Keep everybody back.

<i>alright, everybody back</i>.
-- mann ..

I thought you were .. dead.

Hey... you didn't kill him
