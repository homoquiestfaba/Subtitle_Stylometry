[Water running]


What the fuck do you
think you're doing,

You perverted piece of shit?

MAN: Ahh!

Get the fuck out
of here, right now.

Sorry!
Sorry!

Sorry!

It's just, we need to
introduce the tit of the week

And we thought maybe...

You thought what?

You fucking worthless, perverted
piece of motherfucking crap!

Get the fuck out
of here right now!

I'll give you fucking tit
of the week, all right?

Fuck off!

Fuck off!

Get out or I'll
fucking sue your ass.

You, too!

Who the fuck are you?

Get out!

Get out!

[Interposing voices]

Get out!

I'll fucking sue your ass.


[Boing noise]

Thanks to the stamina and vigor
of the modern-day Tromette,

The world is a much safer place
for naturalists of every kind.

And speaking of
Tromette, why don't we

Take a moment out right now to
check out our tit of the week?

Popcorn.

Corn.

[Breathes deeply]
I love popcorn.

Mmm.

Yes.


Popcorn.

Oh, I love popping popcorn.

Yes.

Oh.

Ooh, yeah.

[Heavy breathing]

[Phone ringing]


MAN (ON PHONE): Hello, Debbie.

Hey.

Who is this?

MAN (ON PHONE): A friend.

Mmm.

MAN (ON PHONE): What're
you doing right now?

Uh, I'm just
making some popcorn.

And, um, I'm gonna
watch a movie.

MAN (ON PHONE): Really?

Mm-hmm.

MAN (ON PHONE): Which one?

Huh.

I don't know yet.

Something scary.

MAN (ON PHONE): You
likes scary movies?

WOMAN: Yeah.

Well, some of them, anyway.

MAN (ON PHONE): Well,
which ones don't you like?

I really hate those new
slasher movies where they hire

These beautiful TV stars
to get hacked up one by one

By some guy in a $4.99 mask.

I mean, I just don't go
in for that super hip,

Ultra-cool, ironic bullshit,
you know what I mean?

MAN (ON PHONE): You sound
like a tough nut to crack.

Fuckin' A, pal.

MAN (ON PHONE): I'll
bet I could scare you.

Oh yeah?

Why don't you try?

MAN (ON PHONE): OK.

Try this on for size.

You're broke.

[Suspenseful music]

MAN (ON PHONE): You heard me.

You're flat broke.

No.

No.

I invested!

MAN (ON PHONE): Oh, yeah.

You invested, all right.

In dot-com companies.

All those profits
you thought you

Had when the stocks were high?

They didn't exist.

You put your money
in a virtual company

And you end up with a
whole lot of virtual money.

You've got nothing.


No!

No!

This is a mistake.

This is bullshit.

[Sudden silence]


[Smoke detector beeping]

Oh, no!



[Phone ringing]


Listen, asshole...

MAN (ON PHONE): No, you listen
to me, you little bitch.

Hang up on me again and
I'll gut you like a fish.

Understand?

Who are you?

What do you want?

What do you want?

Ask [scream]


Who's there?

I'm calling the police!

MAN (ON PHONE): Don't bother.

They'd be on our side.

about this, Debbie.

Nothing personal.


Take it all, guys.

No!

No!

No, no!

You fucking,
blood-sucking freak!

I have money.

You can't take my stuff.

Oh.

By the way, Deb? [Chuckle]



You have a nice day. [Chuckle]

Pfft.

Troma videos.

(MAKING FART NOISE
WITH MOUTH) Pfft.

You can keep those.

So don't wait.

Contact your distributor
today to place your order.

Let's get Tromatized!


The movie business is unique
in that it's both an art

Form and a business, and that's
why a movie studio like Troma

Is required to have
a board of directors.

These are people
who are specially

Trained to make the
kind of decisions

That we artists aren't
prepared to make.

Decisions about
budgets, about banks,

About philosophy, about
stock, leveraged buyouts, god

Knows what.

But right in here there's
a meeting going on

And we've got
permission to go inside,

But you must be
very, very quiet.

Let's see what's going on
with the... with the Troma

Board of directors.

We have to be
very, very naughty.

Quick, when do the
banks open in Geneva?

ALL: 2:00 AM.

What was the Deutsche
Mark selling at yesterday?

ALL: 1.54.

Current value of Troma Class A?

ALL: 36 and 5/8.

OK.

Ginger, get on the
phone with Hans.

Tell him we need
to set up three-way

With the boys in Tokyo.

Heather, I need spreadsheets
and fiscal '91, '92, and '93.

Darlene, do you have
any clear nail polish?

I just broke another one.

ALL: Oh, no!

[Interposing voices]

Can you tell us anything
about the situation?

Well, Susan, you know we
can't discuss the case.

But a male suspect
named... [laughs]

Officer Ressler,
Susan Wonton, Action...


Can you tell us anything
about this situation?

Well, Susan, we cannot
discuss this case, as you know.


Susan Wonton, Action
69 News, Tromaville.

Can you tell us anything
about the situation?

Now, Susan, you know we
cannot discuss the case,

But I can tell you
that there's a suspect

Named Guruse who has led a
female hostage into a gang...


Susan, I can
categorically say you

Look great in that trench coat.

Where'd you get it?

Waffles Are Us.

That's in Little Belgium.

Oh, I'm... that's wonderful.


This is live TV.

Fuck, I me... I
mean... I mean fudge.

Now, getting back
to the police...


What do you think is going
on with the hostage situation?



Braaaaains!

Oh, OK.

Um, Officer Ressler, uh, now
that you're a mindless zombie

Just shambling around...


Officer Ressler,
how do you feel?

How do you feel?

Braaaaains.


Fuck.

How do you feel right now?

Tell us how you feel.

Braaaains.

Officer Nessler... er,
Ressler... Officer,

Ressler how do you feel?


Hi.

My name is Larry McGinley, and
I work at Troma Entertainment,

And I'm, uh, new here at Troma.

I edit all the segments
for DVDs, and I also, uh,

Manage the DVDs, try to make
sure they get out on time.

For the DVD of
"Sugar Cookies," I

Was asked to get in touch with
Oliver Stone for an interview.

Oliver Stone associate-produced
"Sugar Cookies."

So I emailed Oliver Stone.

I called his office.

And basically was
told that Oliver Stone

Is very busy editing his movie.

And I told Lloyd this, and
he said, no, try again.

Try again.

And he said,
basically, that Oliver

Stone and him were very close.

They grew up together, and they
had a very deep friendship.

And so I called
the assistant back

And, uh, told her
about the closeness

Between Oliver Stone and Lloyd.

Because they were
so close growing up.

But I... I can't
stress enough the, uh,

Closeness between
Oliver and Lloyd.

It's just to emphasize
the closeness...

The closeness... the closeness...

And she told me to
write another email,

Basically expressing the points
that I had discussed with her.

And I did that, and I called
back after I sent the email

And they told me that
Oliver Stone was going out

Of the country again, because
he's doing post-production

For "Alexander."

And I told Lloyd this, and
he said to me, look, Larry.

You need to get an
interview with Oliver

Stone for "Sugar Cookies."

If you don't, there will
be dire consequences.

So I begged.

I fellated.

I did everything
humanly possible

To bring your Larry
McGinley's exclusive interview

With Oliver Stone.

Let's watch.

The truth is, I was not allowed
to conduct this interview.

After the persistent calling,
Oliver Stone put a restraining

Order out on me, and I
could not do it because it

Would be considered harassment.

So we flew Troma superstar,
Debbie Rochon, out to Alaska,

Where Oliver Stone was
staying with his friends,

Yasser Arafat and Fidel Castro.

That's why he's wearing
the fur coat that you'll

See in this interview.

So without further ado, I
bring you Debbie Rochon's

Interview with Oliver Stone.

Enjoy.


This is Debbie Rochon for
Troma, and I'm here in Alaska

Where it's sunny, it's cold, and
there's lots of mass transit...

And a lot of development, as
you can see in the background.

I have got the exclusive
interview with Oliver Stone,

And he is sitting
right now, as we speak,

With Fidel Castro
and Yasser Arafat.

This is history in the making.

Only Troma can provide you
with this critical interview,

OK, uh, Mr. Stone,
the first question

Is, why were you always
late to be on the set

For "Sugar Cookies?"

I'm sorry I'm late for work.

I needed to pick up
bird seed for my wife.

did your wife say to you when

She found out she was pregnant?

I'm sorry I'm late.

OK, Mr. Stone.

Last question for you, sir.

Why did it take you so long
to grant us an interview?

Well, I had to pick up
bird seed for my wife.

OK.

'Bout wraps it up for,
uh, Troma Team News.

Thank you very much for
doing this interview.

We appreciate it, and, um,
hope you enjoy "Sugar Cookies."


Good news, Lloyd.

I just fixed your Windows XP
Professional and wireless LAN.

That's great, Asphyxia.

Hey, Michael, now we can get
back on the NAMBLA website!

Now if she could only
help me with my golf swing.

Oh, Michael.

are too mu... [laughs]

Ooh, that will
be all, Asphyxia.

Thank you very much, uh...

Cheap motherfucker. [Laughs]

Greetings from Tromaville,
and welcome to the lovingly

Recreated, digitally remastered
director's cut version

Of the DVD of "Tales
from the Crapper"...

Julie Strain's "Tales
from the Crapper."

You know, this
introduction is gonna

Be a bit different from
how we usually do things

Around here in Tromaville.

Lloyd and I felt it was
time to shed some insight

Into the turbulent history
of Troma Entertainment

And the long, hard
road of bringing

"Tales from the Crapper"
to the big screen.

It's a little-known fact,
but when Troma was established

Many, many, many
moons ago, we actually

Had three founding partners.

Sure, everyone knows of
the flamboyant and outgoing

President of Troma
Entertainment and the creator

Of "The Toxic Adventure,"
Lloyd Kaufman.

And, even though he
remains in the shadows

And is publicity-averse,
everyone knows and loves

Vice President Michael Herz, who
transformed a simple taco stand

By the sea into the
media empire known

Today as Troma Entertainment.

But few of you know of the
third and most silent founding

Member of the Troma Team...


Zelda Lipshitz.

She was our Yale classmate
and the true creative genius

Behind Troma's success.

And the mediator and
pragmatist of our rag-tag group.

For years, Michael and
I argued continually

About whose dream project we'd
make into cinematic reality.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: I wanted to
spin a gritty, feminist yarn

About a big-breasted bimbo
cop who must go undercover

At a sleazy strip bar to
catch the topless alien mantis

Whore who's laying waste to
our fair city's perverts.

And I, still pissed off at the
high price of my Yale tuition,

Caused my poor family to starve.

Felt we should tell a
cautionary tale, dealing

With the blood-sucking,
money-hungry college admission

Boards with those
bastards being represented

By a trio of big-titted
vampire lesbian strippers.

But being a small, struggling,
independent movie studio,

Troma only had enough money
to finance one motion picture.

On more than one
occasion, Lloyd and I

Nearly came to blows.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: But
like clockwork, Zelda

Would intervene with a
brilliant compromise,

Continuing a steady flow
of financial success

For the Troma Team.

NARRATOR: After the
multimillion-dollar success

Of Troma's "The
Girl Who Returned,"

The net profits were
split three ways.

Lloyd squandered his earnings
on polyester, perm treatments,

And an extensive
toupee collection

Resulting from too many perms.

Michael's millions went
towards the production of his

Yet-to-be-released country
album, "It Herz to Be Me"

AKA "Chinese Demiracy."

This left them with little money
for their future endeavors.

Fortunately for Troma, Zelda
had wisely invested her money,

Enabling them to finance
the international smash hit

And 10-time Academy
Award-winning film, "The Battle"

Of Love's Return,"
thus allowing Troma

To survive another decade.

Which leads us to the 1980s,
Troma's best and worst era.

It was the decade of
the "me" generation,

A credo Lloyd Kaufman
and Michael Herz

Took quite literally to heart.

Michael embraced the
popular fads of the time,

Blowing his money on
things like new coke.

Lloyd spent his time with
the local Boy Scout chapters

And liquidated his fund,
paying off his legal fees

For his involvement in
the notorious Brinks

Sperm bank heist of 1984.

P.S., if you don't
get by now, we

Are saying that Lloyd Kaufman
is gay... very, very gay.

And, like before,
Michael and Lloyd

Still argued over whose
stupid, crappy dream movie

Would be shot.

In this decade of
selfishness, all Zelda

Could think of was
Troma Entertainment,

And how her beloved
company could persevere.

It was during this
turbulent time

That she created
Troma's flagship

Franchise, "The Toxic Avenger."

Yet three decades of
dealing with Lloyd

And Michael's bullshit took
a toll on her well being.

She went fucking nuts.

That, and not hiring Madonna
for the first turn-on,

And Lloyd's addiction
to ladies' footwear,

And my horrifying
battle with anorexia

Finally proved to be
too much for Zelda

And she committed suicide.



Some people say that
Zelda killed herself

Because of the pressure of
having to be the peacekeeper

At Troma Film Studios,
but everyone knows women

Just can't run movie studios.

Look at Sherry Lansing.

And besides, Zelda's suicide
note was so forgiving.

She loved us.

All she ever wanted was for
us to learn to work together.

But it took her death for
us to realize that we are

Strongest when we compromise.

And that, little
Johnny, is how "Tales"

From the Crapper...
Julie Strain's Tales

"From the Crapper" came to be.

You see, we combined
our two dream

Projects into one great film.

Sure, we had to
use shitty, cheap,

Digital video with no
semblance of a plot,

And resort to cheapo
fart jokes and use

Drunken crews and
have absolutely

No production values...

Because that's the
way Zelda would've

Wanted us to spend
the money intended

For her funeral and coffin.

So Zelda Lipshitz,
wherever you are,

"Julie Strain's Tales from the
Crapper" is dedicated to you.

This movie is your legacy.

Now how about that
blow job, Skinny?

You got it, partner.



MAN: More!

Faster!

sex and violence...

MAN: Lloyd, oh Lloyd!

blood and guts.

MAN: Oh, Lloyd!

I'm in heaven, Lloyd.

the sound of silence

'Til it drives me totally nuts.

[Interposing voices]

time I come around,

MAN: More!

watch your yapper.

How many souls are buried
underground, watching

"Tales from the Crapper?"

Ah!

Don't forget the ballsack!

Ah!

Ah!

Ahhhhh!

Greetings from Tromaville
and welcome to the lovingly

Recreated, digitally
remastered, director's cut,

DVD version of...

MAN: That Troma triple beheader
of "Bloodspell," "Alien

Blood," and "Drawing Blood."

Directed by... oh, excuse
me, I gotta sneeze before I

Tell you who directed it.

Directed by...

MAN: Darren Warren, John
Sorensen, and Sergio Lapel.

One of my favorite directors.

How about you, Debbie Rochon?

Mine, too!

You know, I've been
having difficulty hearing,

Debbie Rochon.

Could you, perhaps, use this
to tell me who stars in, uh...

MAN: "Bloodspell?"

Tell us who stars in
that movie, Debbie.

Well, Lloyd.

MAN: Aaron Teach.

Woohoo!

Oh, that's fascinating
because... because...

MAN: Aaron Teach from
"Mirror of Death."

He's my favorite actor.

And who else stars in...
In, uh, in, uh, in, uh...

MAN: "Bloodspell."


MAN: Anthony Jenkins!

Waah!

Why, that's a great
cast, Debbie Rochon.

I... you know, I think that's one
of the reasons why... [vomiting]

MAN: The Troma triple beheader
of "Bloodspell," "Alien

Blood," and "Drawing Blood."

Is my very favorite.

I... I just love it.

I love the color and the
sound and the... you know,

It's an amazing film.

And I'll tell you
another thing, Debbie.

Did you know that...

MAN: "Alien Blood."

Was shot entirely
on location in...

MAN: England.

And... and another thing is
that did you know that the, uh,

It was produced by...

MAN: John Sorensen.

Thank you.

Eh... any more questions, Debbie?

Uh, I do have a question.

How did they do the thing...

MAN: in "Bloodspell" where
the guy gets set on fire?

Ah.

That's a very simple question.

That's what makes

MAN: "Bloodspell."

My favorite film of the...

MAN: Late '80s.

That period of time
is so fascinating.

Well, Debbie Rochon,
let's get ready to watch

The lovingly recreated,
digitally remastered,

Director's cut version of...

The Troma triple beheader of
"Bloodspell," "Alien Blood,"

And "Drawing Blood."

Let's watch.

[Heavy music]

I'm having so much fun.

Oh, greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

To the lovingly recreated,
digitally remastered,

Director's cut, DVD
version of Chris

Watson's "Slaughter Party."

And we're having a great party
here, aren't we Debbie Rochon?

Yeah!

Anyway, Chris Watson,
as you may know,

Is the director and creator
of the classic movie

"Zombiegeddon."

And it's a little-known
fact that "Zombiegeddon"

Is actually a shot-by-shot
remake of Spielberg's classic,

Seminal, epic,
black-men-on-a-boat movie,

"Amistad."

And speaking of seminal
movies, I made a movie called,

"I Am a Stud."

I'm having so much fun.

With "Slaughter Party,"
Chris Watson made

His own version of Spielberg's
"Schindler's List."

Instead of using
Nazis, he used midgets.

Instead of using pretentious
black-and-white film,

He uses crappy, digital
video... just like this intro!

I'm having so much fun!

And instead of
using European Jews,

He uses porno Jews,
like Adam Seymour

Butts Glasser and Ron Jeremy.

Wow, there are many famous
penises in this movie.

That's right, Lloyd.

But there's one more.

Falissa Rose is in this
movie, and if you remember,

She had a penis in
"Sleepaway Camp."

You know, I used to
have a penis once,

Uh, but it was a
small price to pay

For this Adonis-like physique.

Thank you, anabolic steroids.

You know, a little blood doping.

Oh, what... what time is it?

world, Debbie Rochon?

It's big, baby.

[Interposing voices]

Oh!

I'm so juiced up, I
could work for Tropicana.

Lloyd, you acted in this movie.

What can you tell us about it?

Wh... I was?

I acted in this movie?

You know, I gotta start
watching these Troma

Movies once in a while.

You know, Lloyd, some of us do
a little bit more around here

Than just playing with our cock.

Huh?

[Chicken noises]

It's not like I'm clucking
things up, Anorexia, right?

I'm having so much fun!

So let's watch "Slaughter
Party," directed

By Chris Watson, lovingly
made, digitally remastered,

Director's cut DVD.

Let's watch.

Greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

To the lovingly remastered,
digitally recreated,

Director's cut, DVD version
of Darren Warren's "Mirror"

Of Death."

Speaking of the mirror of death,
uh, on further reflection,

It has come to my attention
that many ugly people who

Have looked into
the mirror of death

Have... have had horrible
tragedies befall them.

We now switch you to Debbie
Rochon, roving reporter,

On location to investigate this
serious matter of the mirror

Of death and the ugly people.

Lloyd, I'm standing outside
the Troma building right now.

I'm investigating the origins
of the mirror of death.

It seems that ever since Troma
has released Mirror of Death

On DVD, ugly people have died
after looking in mirrors.

In fact, the Troma Homoland
Security Department

Has put celebrities like
Kathie Lee Gifford, Barbra

Streisand, Rosie O'Donnell,
and even Camryn Manheim

On orange alert.

They are not allowed
to look into mirrors.

Let's go now to some man
in the street interviews

I conducted earlier.

[Speaking german]

And now back to you, asshole!

That is fascinating, Debbie.

Now could give us
some more detail

About that classic
movie, Mirror of Death?

Mirror of Death stars Julie
Merrill, who played Woman

At Bar in episode 2.5 of
that famous '90s sitcom,

Herman's Head.

Back to you, head cheese.

And Julie Merrill's performance
in that particular episode

Was almost as seamless
and as spotless

As Troma superstar, Will
Keenan's performance in Eternal

Sunshin of the Spotless Mind.

You hardly even know
Will's in the movie.

In fact, you can't even
find him in the movie.

That shows you the
genius of my brother,

The director, Charlie Kaufman.

OK, biatch.

Back to you.

It also stars Jack
Castro, who has

Been president of The Poseidon
Adventure fan club since 1999.

Back to you, fuck head.

That's fascinating,
Debbie, but I'm

President of The Return to the
Poseidon Adventure fan club.

Now that's a true classic.

And now Debbie, would
you please tell me

What that crappy, movie,
Mario of Death is all about?

Mirror of Death is about an
abused woman who conjures up

Evil spirits to
get revenge on all

The men who mistreated
her, just like you've

Mistreated me, fuckwad.

You talentless hack,
bullshit filmmaker.

Back to you.

That's fascinating, Debbie.

But it's a little known fact,
Debbie, that Mirror of Death

Was going to be one of the
great movie franchises.

There was going to be many
Mirror of Death movies.

There was going to be Fork
of Death, Toothpick of Death,

Dental Floss of Death,
Salami of Death,

Doorknob of Deathm A Gunshot
in the Head of Death,

And my personal
favorite, Dom Deluise

And the Magic Muffin of Death.

Yes, The Mirror of Death was
destined to be the world's

Greatest film franchise.

Unfortunately, there was a
terrible, terrible problem

In the copyright office
because it turns out

That all those films
have already been

Made by Francis Ford Coppola.

Now back to you, cunt.

Well, shit for
brains, Mirror of Death

Is a very serious movie.

If you break a mirror, you
get seven queers bad fuck.

I'm sorry, Debbie,
but you're breaking up.

It sounded like you said,
seven queers of bad fuck.

Yes, Lloyd.

I did say, seven
queers bad fuck.

If you break a mirror,
Lloyd, you will get the worst

Gay gang banging ever.

And your ass will
bleed for weeks.

Seven queers bad fuck?

Oh, Debbie, that
sounds horrible.

That sounds just terrible.

That sounds... Oh!

I... Oh, I guess I broke
the mirror of death.

MAN (OFF SCREEN): Are
you ready, sailor?

Because you have
seven pink torpedoes

Aimed at the SS Brown Eye.

What?

I've never done anything
like that before.

Let me just get my
whip, and my mask,

And the hot candle
wax, and the gerbil.

No, no.

I've got a hamster
in here somewhere.

Hold on a sec,
where's that hamster?

Goddammit.

Oh... wha... back to
you, Debbie, and hi-ho!

[Television static]

OK, boys!

Come on, now.

This bung hole isn't
going to fill itself.

[Farting noises]

Now where is that hamster?

Where the hell is that...

Greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

To the lovingly
recreated, digitally

Mastered director's cut DVD of
The Triple Beheader of... what?

Wait a minute.

What triple beheader?

I don't even know
what I'm... I need

An expert on triple beheaders.

What... oh, my heavens!

Look who's here!

Oh, ow, oh!

Hey, Lloyd.

Why, it's Debbie Rochon.

Debbie Rochon, star of Terror
Firmer, Tromeo and Juliet,

The independent screen goddess.

Debbie, what... what...
Tell us what's up!

Well, uh, your
colon and checks out.

Why, thank you, Debbie
Rochon, but we're

Talking about triple beheaders.

Oh, well, on this DVD, we
have Killy Billy Vampire.

My!

And what else?

Sucker the Vampire.

And?

Tainted.

By the way, I do need
to check out your taint.

I guess people can enjoy
the movies while I go

And check out your taint.

Hold on.

Why, thank you, Debbie Rochon.

That's fascinating.

At any rate, triple
beheader is a...

[Sucking sounds]

Three movies on one disk,
thank to the miracle

Psychology of V3 technology.

[Chainsaw buzzing]

V3 technology is
the only technology

That can produce the
highest quality to put

Three movies on one disk.

It's like... it's not a
box set, it's a boxette.

Now Debbie Rochon, what were
those movies that are on this?

Oh, that was, uh,
taint-a-riffic!

By the way, your taints
look really good.

Thank you.

Yeah.

You're taint... tainted welcome.

Uh, we have Rockabilly Vampire.

Where is Rockabilly
Vampire from?

Uh, the south?

No, it's from Taintsilvania.

Oh!

Sorry!

And we have Sucker, the
Vampire, which, you know,

I'll have to check
that out later, too.

And we have Taint.

Tainted, the movie.

Tainted.

Oh, yeah.
Tainted.

Da Vinci was a great
tainter, I know.

At any rate, this is
Lloyd Kaufman and...

Debbie Rochon.

And we're pleased to bring
you the triple beheader of...

Tainted.

Let's watch!

[Banjo music playing]

Yahoo!

Yeah, greetings
from Tromaville.

And welcome to the lovingly
recreated, digitally

Remastered director's cut
DVD of "Ragin' Cajun."

Now Debbie Rochon,
what can you tell us

About this amazing
film, "Ragin' Cajun."

Well, like many movies
from the '90s, from "Home"

Alone " to " Terminator 2.

"Ragin' Cajun" is about a
Vietnam vet kick boxer who

Becomes a country music singer!

Only, in "Ragin' Cajun," Troma's
terminator is David Heavener.

Wow.

That is fascinating,
Debbie Rochon,

But I would like
to know, Anorexia,

Could you tell us please,
who is the director?

The style is fascinating.

Definitely.

William Byron Hillman.

Woo!

William Byron Hillman
is not only the director,

But he has three names,
just like Mary Kate Olsen,

Only he's not as fat.

Who else, for example?

There must be some other
stars in this wonderful film?

Yes.

Sam Bottoms, who was
in Apocalypse Now.

And let's not forget Samantha
Eggers, who was in The Brude.

Well, I like to keep
my bottoms in shape

By starting every day
with two delicious eggers

And some fresh brewed coffee.

You know, I was thinking,
Debbie Rochon, while we're

Having this great hoedown.

You know, I got those
airplane tickets.

I'm going to go down to New
Orleans, home of Ragin' Cajun

Because we're getting ready
to do Tromance Gone Wild.

Yeah!

And I'm so excited!

I was so excited about
going down to Mardi Gras,

I bought myself a plane
ticket way, way in advance.

And it cost me a
lot of money, too.

In fact, it made
me into a po'boy.

I think this Ragin'
Cajun DVD... I think

It's going to be the biggest
thing to hit New Orleans

Since Katrina and the waves.

MAN (OFF SCREEN): Oh!


Have you no decency, sir?

As usual, Lloyd,
very bad taste.

Well, what... what are
you looking so sore about?

Katrina and The Waves
had a big hit song.

It was called,
Walking on Sunshine.

There were people in New
Orleans that loved it.

Yeah, it was a big hit!
New Orleans loved...

Lloyd!
Lloyd!

There was just a big
hurricane down in New Orleans

Called Katrina.

It almost wiped everything
out, killed hundreds,

And made the police go looting.

What?

What?

Oh, the humanity!

My ticket's nonrefundable!

Call FEMA, call The Red
Cross, call my travel agent.

Lloyd, you can't joke
about the hurricane.

Only politicians can!

If you can't joke
about the hurricane,

Then the terrorists
will have won!

The terrorists didn't create
the hurricane, God did!

Then God is a terrorist
and we must bring him down!

We must kill him!

Mission accomplished!

Mission accomplished!

Hey, bring it on!

Bring it on!

We've won!

Albert Gore!

You take over, Debbie Rochon!

Debbie Rochon, take over!

I've got... I've got to take
care of these plane tickets.

I want my money back!

All right.

Well, this DVD, Ragin'
Cajun also features Trauma

System Troma Informercial.

It aired on Comedy
Central and it

Featured that thin
guy who tried to pan

Himself off as Michael Herz.

Now look, you!

I don't care, you get me the
money... you can get someone

Else to buy my airplane ticket!

What are you talking
about, people don't want

To go to a city underwater?

Tourists go to
Venice every year!

Oh!

Anyway, let's get ready to watch
the... the lovingly recreated,

Digitally remastered directors
DVD version of William

Jennings Bryan's classic
film, Ragin' Cajun

Now Debbie Rochon...

(IN UNISON) Let's watch!

Greetings from Tromavile.

This is Debbie Rochon and
as some of you may know,

I recently had brain surgery!


But it all worked out!


Yeah, but the bad news is
there is some bad news.

My doctors don't think
I'm going to make it

Through this DVD introduction.


But... But there is good news.

From the same happy
accidents of technology,

The same happy accidents
where those idiot

Astronauts were walking
around on the moon and they

Discovered Tang...


Yeah, baby, Tang!


That's right.

When the doctors were rummaging
around through my brain,

They found the same
type of happy accident.

A new technology,
Brain-O-Vision.


Yeah!

It's this groovy new chip
that's implanted in your head

Where you can
actually read people's

Thoughts right on the screen.

That is, if you have a brain.

Hey, Debbie!
Debbie Rochon!

Lloyd Kaufman!

Why, thank you so much for
introducing this lovingly

Recreated, digitally
remastered director's

Cut DVD of the fifth volume
of The Best of Troma Dance.

I would have done this
introduction myself,

But I'm just so busy.

No problem, Lloyd.

Anything for you.

Did you know that Troma Dance...

Now did you know that
Troma Dance, the only truly

Independent film festival
on the entire planet,

Is celebrating it's 10th
anniversary this year?

Wow, Debbie Rochon, queen
of independent cinema, that

Is terrific!

And you know, Troma Dance is the
only festival where you don't

Have to pay submission fees.

When you submit your
movie, it's free.

It's not like
Sundance where they

Make you pay a lot of
money to submit your movie

And then they don't even
give you a fuck you letter.

Yes, Troma Dance is also free.

You can watch the movies for
free and there's no VIP policy.

Everyone is equal.

Even Karen Black, who was our
big guest, big super guest,

Last year, ate the cold pizza
just like everybody else.

It's hard to believe
that Troma Dance

Has been around for 10 years.

If I'm not mistaken,
that's an entire decade

Of real independence in Park
City, not fake independence.

And that's because
of the Troma fans!

Wow!

We love our fans.

That's why we're
bringing you the

Fifth... the fifth big volume
of The Best of Troma Dance DVD!


Hey, hey, can we
have your autograph?

Oh, certainly, my young man.

Oh, not you, you
fucking old man.

Debbie, can we have
your autograph, please?

Lloyd, can I borrow your pen?

Thank you.
Right here?

Yeah.

A little lower?

Oh, sure.

A little lower.

Um, OK.

Oh, yeah.

Debbie, oh, yes!

Oh!

That scar looks so sexy on you.

That's so...

Oh, the one on my head?
Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah, it looks
really, really hot.

Let's get read to watch the
lovingly recreated, digitally

Remastered director's
cut DVD of The Best

Of Troma Dance Volume Five.

Let's watch!

[Music playing]

[Silly music playing]

[Dance music playing]

How are you?

You made it!

How are you guys doing?

Turn the camera off.

Greetings not from Tromaville,
but from the luxurious,

All steel and glass
Raymond Chandler Pavilion,

Here in sunny Hollywood.

I'm Lloyd Kaufman, president
of Troma Entertainment

And creator of
The Toxic Avenger.

And we're hosting the
Debbie Rochon Tribute.

Yes, it's only
logical that I should

Be the host because I'm the one
who discovered Debbie Rochon.

You know, one of the
reasons Troma is so famous

Is that we have
been the breeding

Ground, the discoverers
of amazing, new talent.

Samuel L. Jackson appears
in... in Death by Temptation.

And Kevin Costner's
in Sizzle Beach USA.

Robert De Niro's first
film is The Wedding Party.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone
are in Troma's Cannibal,

The Musical.

But I think our
greatest discovery,

Our greatest
achievement is bringing

Forth to the silver screen the
talents of Miss Debbie Rochon.

Yes, I immediately noticed
her two greatest talents.

Acting...

[Fog horn blowing]

And acting.

[Fog horn blowing]

To tell you the
truth, I was blinded

By the fabulousness
of Debbie Rochon

And I decided to make
a major investment.

So I showered her with gold.

LLOYD KAUFMANN (VOICE
OVER): Oh, Debbie.

You are so talented
and beautiful,

I'm going to shower
you with gold.

I think you are Troma-riffic.

[1980's music playing]

I've just been pissed on by
a blind, independent movie

Director!

Yuck!

At any rate, I am not the only
fan of the award winning Miss

Rochon and her Golden Globes.

She has legions of loyal
fans all over the world

And we have asked some of
them to film themselves

Paying tribute to her.

For example, in this
first one, you're

Going to observe choreographer
Mikhail Baryshnikov.

But what's interesting is he
has chosen as his director

None other than the legendary
Russian filmmaker, Andrei

Tarkovsky.

Note, if you will,
how Tarkovsky uses

The masterful wide shot and
never ever cuts to a close up.

You'll also notice
that Baryshnikov, who

Refers to himself now as
Debbie's superfan Tim...

Baryshnikov also has a
complete Debbie Rochon

Collection in his basement,
but the brilliant Tarkovsky

Does not dare to tempt
us with closeups of any

Of the Debbie memorabilia.

Let's watch superfan Tim,
aka Mikhail Baryshnikov.

I am here with The
Wall's creator, The Buck.

What exactly is
The Wall of Rochon?

Let me tell you there, brother.

The Wall of Rochon, it's
the most electrifying wall

In the world today.

This wall has it all.

But what makes this
wall really special

Is that it's entirely
dedicated to the goddess

Of all that is good and evil,
the lovely and talented Debbie

Rochon.

So why, out of all the
people in the entire world,

Would you choose Debbie Rochon?

Well, that's simple.

Debbie Rochon is the best
there is, the best there was,

And the best there ever will be.

She is truly an inspiration.

She's overcome the
odds her entire life

And is still a
sweet, kind, caring,

And wonderful human being.

Debbie Rochon truly
is one of a kind.

So let's discuss exactly what
is on The Wall of Rochon.

We have Scream Queen
Illustrated signed

Trading cards right here.

We have cards from
The Santa Claus,

They're from Scream
Queens Illustrated also.

They're signed by Debbie Rochon.

Then we have some
signed terror cards.

I actually busted a 60 box case.

It took me forever.

I even put the sets
together of terror cards

Just to get Debbie
Rochon's autos.

Then if you take a close look,
over here, in the corner,

You will see a
gold sequin dress.

That dress right there
is the exact dress

You can see Debbie wearing
in the movie, Terror Firmer,

At the end of the movie.

It's a very lovely dress.

I am very proud to own it.

If you look in the
middle here, you'll

See a white tank top
covered in blood, which is

Also signed by Debbie Rochon.

And you will also
see a blue nurse's

Scrub, which is also
covered in blood

And signed by Debbie Rochon.

Both of these pieces were worn
by the lovely and talented

Actress in the opening
kill seen of the movie,

American Nightmare.

She was great in that movie.

She was a true, true psycho.

And if you look over here,
in this corner over here,

You will a lovely jacket.

This jacket is a
favorite piece of mine

Because it was worn
by Debbie Rochon

In the movie, Abducted 2.

But what makes it
really special is

This jacket here was
Debbie Rochon's jacket

Before and after the movie.

It was her personal jacket.

It's an amazing piece.

It really is.

And then if you look down
here, you'll see the latest

Addition to my collection.

These gloves were worn by Debbie
Rochon in the movie, Zeppo.

Debbie Rochon actually
gave these to me

As a gift when I
met her for the very

First time at Fangoria Weekend
in Chicago, Illinois this year.

It was truly a wonderful event.

And then down here, you will
see my DVD collection and

A few VHSs from Debbie Rochon.

I've only got about
60 total right now,

So I got a ways to go there.

Basically, you'll
see others items,

Like the autographed Scream
Queens Illustrated magazines,

The B Movie Survival
Guide, Debbie's poster

Book, and some other photos.

But Debbie Rochon truly
is an amazing woman.

And I'm truly honored to
have this wall right here,

Right in my home, as a tribute
to such a wonderful woman.

Wow, Buck.

Seems like you are a really
good fan of Debbie Rochon.

Until next time, this is Biff.

See you around the corner.

For our next piece, we
called upon the talents

Of none other than
French New Wave director,

Jean-Luc Godard, who, as you
know, pioneered the jump cut.

In this particular sequence that
pays tribute to Debbie Rochon,

Gerard Depardieu plays the
part of Joe the Truckdriver.

And we needed a
blank wall for this.

So even though this sequence
was filmed on the Champs Elysees

During The Cannes Film Festival,
thanks to those good dream

Weavers at George Lucas's
Skywalker Ranch, $2 million

Has been invested in the highest
state of the art brown screen

CGI, so that the drab wall
that you see behind Joe

The Truckdriver
could be created.

You'd never guess that this
sequence wasn't actually shot

Against a crappy looking wall.

Let's watch!

It's a little known fact,
but during the filming

Of Andy Warhol's path
finding movie, Chelsea Girls,

Featuring Mary Woronov,
many of the cast

Would sit back and watch
Debbie Rochon footage.

So when you're watching this
archival footage of Fanatic

Mike watching Debbie
Rochon's movie,

Nowhere Man, make sure you watch
for the experimental technique

Of the great Andy Warhol.

Hi.

It's Friday night.

It's movie night.

I'm figuring out what to watch.

That's easy around here.

It's usually a
Debbie Rochon film.

Her movies usually give
me a lot of entertainment

From laughing my ass
off to getting the ever

Loving shit scared out of me.

Well, tonight,
we're going to try

And sit down and watch a great
film called, Nowhere Man.

One of Debbie's latest movies,
very critically acclaimed,

Great all around family film.

If you've seen it, don't
give me ending here.

I want to find for myself.

It's taking me
enough courage just

To try and even get to
watch a movie like this

Because frankly,
getting my penis

Cut off, or watching
a man's penis cut off

Gives me the shivers.

I'm going to sit back
and start the film.

[Music playing from TV]

DEBBIE ROCHON (FROM TV): Look,
I know how they [inaudible]

Money people.

He took it out.

I'd never seen one before.

ACTOR (FROM TV): Are you
kidding, [inaudible]?

You're fucking beautiful.

You're perfect for this.

LLOYD KAUFMANN (FROM
TV): It seems to me

That your penis was
severed in the base

By an extremely
sharp instrument.

Scissors.

Sounds very logical.

Now the bulba cavinosus
muscle over here,

It's been totally removed.

And the corpus spongiosum,
which in layman

Would be the erectile
tissue, it is... it's gone.

So what we did was we
folded over the skin

And we inserted the catheter.

Hopefully, you can
urinate without

Too much pain in the near
term and... there may be...

God, a catheter.

LLOYD KAUFMANN (FROM
TV): Some psychological...

[Moaning from TV]

He's so pissed, he's
watching the whole thing!

Oh, shit.

Oh, she's going to chew it!

Oh!

Think the tape is done.

Now American treasure,
Robert Altman,

Is noted for his incredible,
revolutionary use of sound.

By using the overlapping
dialogue of the myriad

Of characters he
deals with, he creates

These incredible soundscapes,
which capture our imagination,

And compel us to
listen very carefully,

And to know the inner soul
of all his characters.

Now in this particular
sequence, we're

Going to meet Elliot
Gould, who plays

The mayor of rock and
roll and Lily Tomlin,

Who is playing Debbie Rochon.

They get together to
perform some amazing sound

Exercises in fan convention.

Let's watch.

I think Sal could do my...

I'm staying out of this part.

Sal could do my part for
me because he's paler.

Yes!
OK.

Watch.

You ready?

Yes, go!

Lloyd, I think
we should go now!


Lloyd!

Lloyd!


Lloyd, I think
we should go now!

That is... sadly, that
is a perfect, uh...

Imitation?

Impression?

Imitation... impression of me.

Yes.

That was me being Debbie Rochon.

And look, it's George!

And look at George, who is...
Who can tell you a quote

From American Nightmare.

If you can, a quote
from American Nightmare.

SAL (OFF SCREEN): Uh oh.

My game and I'll
play by my rules!

Wow!

That's good!

And look, it's [inaudible]!

And I can tell you
right now exactly what

Godzilla expert.

Sorry!

And as a matter of fact,
he probably bought something

He can show you right now.

Sure.

See!

GEORGE (OFF SCREEN): And don't
forget to buy a grave digger!

Remember, um, the sports
guys on television?

Like, limited edition!

Now who can resist
the irresistible

And wacky filmmaking style of
Scandinavian pioneer, Lars Von

Trier.

Yes, that Danish cheese
cake has brought you

An incredible sequence using
his famous Dogpile95 method

Of filmmaking in his
native language, entitled...

[Speaking fake danish]

Loosely translated, it refers to
webmaster of debbierochon.com.

Let's watch!

I've actually know
Debbie since 2000.

We met through a mutual
friend of ours, Dick Culpa.

Dick was the then owner and
publisher of Crack Magazine.

And I was working for
him as Crack's webmaster,

One of its contributing
writers, artists and editors.

And Debbie had signed on to be
a character called Miss Cracked.

Anybody that's familiar
with the magazine

Would recall Nancy
Dickering, she

Is a Hollywood Reporter
type... crack reporter

Character within the magazine.

And we were going to go
ahead and replace her

With the Miss Crack character.

Now we did do a couple
photo shoots with Debbie.

We did do a couple parodies.

In the magazine.

As a matter of fact, I believe
it was issue number 357.

We actually did a Toxic
Avenger, Citizen Toxi parody.

I actually didn't sign on
to be Debbie's webmaster

Until Halloween of 2002.

During that time,
I took the website

And completely tore it
down and redesigned it.

I gave it more of a
look of Debbie Rochon.

I gave it more of a horror,
more of a Hollywood,

More of a scream
queen... more Debbie.

Now Hong Kong
filmmaker, Won Kar-Wai,

In his first collaboration
with Hong Kong superstar

Lenny Riefenstahl,
has created this

Incredible Chinese meditation.

It's called, Debbie Rochon
on top of mrskin.com Mr.

Skin talking about Debbie
Rochon in cherry blossoms

Being naked in 72 Troma movies.

Let's watch!

I'm Mr. Skin from mrskin.com,
the world's number one website

For celebrating nudity in film.

I'm also the world's number
one fan of Debbie Rochon

And her nudity in film.

Talk about a reason
to celebrate,

Actually make that two reasons.

Debbie debuted in
the 1981 jail bait

Classic, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Fabulous Stains.

Even then, it was clear
that this Utah native

Radiated pure star power.

And I've got some fabulous
stains to prove it!

Thankfully, has Debbie
scaled the heights of B

Movie stardom, one
D cup at a time,

She hooked up with Troma films.

Debbie's nipple to nipple
chow down with Jane Jensen

In the 1996 classic,
Tromeo and Juliet... it's

One of the all time
great lesbian scenes.

Forget Shakespearean
monologues, this is the Vagina

Monologues done right.

After Tromeo, Debbie went
on to do dazzling nude work

In the Troma epics,
Terror Firmer and Tales

From the Crapper, as
well on Troma's, Edge TV.

This compilation disk
brings you the very breast

Of Debbie's trauma work.

So ease back and dive
into the ravaging

Rackage of Tromaville's
reigning Dairy Queen.

And maybe take a cue
from The Toxic Avenger

And keep a mop handy.

I'm Mr. Skin from
mrskin.com fast forwarding

To the good parts!

Well, folks, I'm
getting that signal.

That's all that time
we have for tonight.

From the Raymond
Chandler Pavilion,

It's very clear
to see that there

Are fans all over the world
who love Debbie Rochon.

Thanks to the hard work of
so many talented people,

We have seen many sides
of Miss Debbie Rochon.

I prefer her front side and
her backside, of course.

Well, free mummia!

Free mummia!

I'm out!

[Punk music playing]

What are you doing?

I'm, uh... I'm doing
the same thing!

Ow!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!


Oh, that feels good, yes!

Nikolai, is that you?


Man, we've been looking
all over for you.

Oh, you have.

I mean... yes, you
know, when you've

Got to go to the
bathroom, you just

Got to go when you're ready.

Oh, I know what you mean.


Oh, that's quite a turd
you're pinching off there, man.


Woah, Nikolai, you
know, you ought to think

About squatting and thrusting.

They do that in Africa.

It really helps the hemorrhoids,
you know what I mean?


All right, well I
better zip and tuck.

Better zip and tuck.

We got [inaudible] to
get out to the session.

You know, your whole
crew's looking for you?

Yes, I... I... I'm...
I'll... I'll... coming!

Larry, I need you
to sign this, please?

Oh, now, look,
can't Nikolai and I

Get our business done in private
without you bothering us?

Oh, man!

Oh, gee whiz!

I'm sorry!

Man!


Juliet, if you keep
forgetting to turn this off,

You're going to burn
down the whole house.

Oh, let it burn.

[Groaning from other room]

I can't stand the noises, Ness.

Every single night!

Then don't listen.

[Glass breaking in other room]

At least tonight, it's not you.

Your other sent me to pick
up some clean dresses.

Why would I need
dresses since dad

Never lets me leave the house?

Oh.

You smell like food.

What'd you make for dinner?

Well, if you keep
missing dinner,

Your parents are
going to fire me.

But for the record, roast beef.

Ew.

How many times have I told you
that cow's scream on their way

To the slaughterhouse?

They know exactly
what's going on.

Spare me the
vegetarian lecture.

And spare yourself, too.

Soon, you're going to be
married to the king cold cuts.

It will all make sense.

You know, I don't
know love Linden.

You know, dad forced
me to say yes.

I know.

He just wants to get his hands
on the Arbuckle's fortune.

I know.

And I don't care.

At least if I marry Linden,
I won't have to go back

In the time out room anymore.

So it doesn't matter
if I don't love him,

I really never loved anybody.

Let me ease your pain.

[Music playing]

That's... there's something.

Sometimes when you touch
me, I dream about men.

It's OK to dream.

Not in this house.

Dreams make you die.

Shh.

Saucy girl.

Adventure for such merchandise.


Will you be my
lawfully wedded...

[Sad music playing]

[Doorbell ringing]

VIRGINIA (OFF
SCREEN): Who is it?

BARBARA (OFF SCREEN): It's me.

I got the cake.

Thank you.

Mmm.

You did such a good
job on this cake, baby.

It's beautiful.

Smells just like a bush.

I spent hours on
that bush cake.

I envy that cake.

Oh, Virginia!

No, no.

What, honey?

Come on!

Now you haven't
kissed me in days!

Honey, I'm going
back to George.

What?

What we had was wonderful...

Was?

Was!

Baby, don't do this to me!

I need you, you need me!

Come on and kiss me!
No, no.

Just stop!

Kiss me!
Kiss me!

It's over!

We're over!

How could you leave
me for a walking dildo!

George isn't one of
the bad guys, Virge.

Oh, yeah?

Wait until he starts
beating you and raping you!

Virge!

Virge, look, what happened
to you was terrible,

But you have to
learn to trust again.

Trust?

Trust?

I had the trust fucked
out of me a long time ago.

Stop it!

Yeah, you fucking bitch!

Stop it!

No!

No!

[Toilet flushing]

I'm pregnant.

Oh, honey.

That's wonderful.

It's great news.

I'll help you raise her.

It's a boy.

I'll take you to the
abortion clinic, baby.

How dare you suggest
that I kill my child!

Barbara!

Barbara!

Don't you remember
what Valerie said?

She said that all men
are incomplete women.

They're walking
abortions, honey.

I mean, this man
riddled world doesn't

Need some more skanky, polluted
penises walking around in it.

You have to abort the
devil's spawn, baby.

Do it for women!

I'll help you.

I have a hanger.

Wait, Virginia.

Look, first, why don't
you eat my pussy?

I thought you'd
never ask, baby.

[Music playing]

You like that?

You like that pussy?

Is that good?


You fucking bitch!

You probably have a
penis in your pants!

Mom, I'm home!

[Organ music playing]

Mom?

Mom?

Gina?

What's wrong?

Oh.

Nothing's wrong, honey.

Nothing's wrong.

Just today's the day
that you're a woman.

That's all.

I'm proud of you.

Did you buy those pads that I
gave you the money for, honey?

Pads are so last century.

I got these.

Tampons?

Oh, no!

They definitely won't do.

Tell me that this is joke!

But all the girls
at school use them!

All the girls at
school are whores!

OK?

They're giving walking dildos
blow jobs in the stairwells.

That's not you.

That's not my little girl.

I think it's time
we had that talk.

You're not a slut.

See, a tampon is a man's
way of saying, see, bitch?

Even when you bleed,
I'll be inside you.

Maxi pad... A maxi pad is a
woman's way of saying, no,

Bastard!

Uh, uh.

We don't need your skanky cock
to clean up our bloody mess.

No!

We could do it ourselves.

Oh, mom, you are so fucked up
with this women's rights shit!

There's nothing wrong with men!

What?

What are you... how dare
you talk to me like that!

Didn't I teach you anything?

What is wrong with you?

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry!

OK.

I'm sorry.

Mommy has a bit of a temper, OK?

I just want you to be happy.

Now look, I bought
you something.

I should have given it
to you a long time ago,

But happy period day.

Come on, open it up!

OK.

S.C.U.M. Manifesto.

Society for Cutting Up
Men by Valerie Solanis.

Mom, what is this?

You don't know what this is?

No.

Valerie Solanis?

This is only the most
important document

That has ever been written.

Do you know who
Valerie Salonis was?

No.

She shot Andy Warhol.

She knew that he, like all
other men, were better off dead.

You're a S.C.U.M. now, baby.

What's a S.C.U.M.?

S.C.U.M. Highlighted this
section for you, honey.

Read it.

S.C.U.M. Dominant, secure,
self confident, nasty, violent,

Selfish, independent,
proud, thrill seeking,

Freewheeling, arrogant females
who consider themselves fit

To rule the universe, who
have free will to the limits

Of this society, and are ready
to wheel onto something far

Beyond what it has to offer.

[Thunder booming]


Mom, this isn't who I am.

I'm not violent, or
selfish, or nasty,

And I... I don't hate men.

Oh, god.

[Sad music playing]

You must hate yourself then.

I do!

I'm a confused goth
girl crying for help!

Can't you see?

I need you to love
me because I'm me!

I do!

What if I were a boy?

You'd want me
dead, wouldn't you?

No!

I would just cut that penis off!

You're sick!

You're sick!

I can't believe you!

I love men, mother, get over it!

I'm one of those girls!

One of what girls?

One of those girls
who blows walking

Dildos in the stairwells!

No!

Ow!

You're a S.C.U.M.!

You're not a tampon loving
bitch, you're a S.C.U.M.!

Moment of truth, mother!

I'm not a S.C.U.M., I'm a slut!

[Knocking on door]

Who's that?

My latest piece of meat.

Oh, you wouldn't!

My boyfriend, Bundy!

Don't hurt him!

Where's my bitch?

NARRATOR (OFF SCREEN): And now,
a word from The Golden Ghouls.

GHOUL (OFF SCREEN): (SINGING)
Thank you for being a ghoul.

Travel down the road,
clean in my stool.

Your hearts cold blue, you're
a corpse in a pile of rot.

And if you threw a funeral,
invited everyone you

biggest stiff would be in me

And the guts attached would say,
thank you for being a ghoul!

NARRATOR (OFF SCREEN):
For a Bengay old time,

Be sure to watch
The Golden Ghouls

Weeknights at 11:00 and 11:30.

Only on Death Time,
television for psycho women.

Your movie's on.

Please!

Mom, don't kill him!

I'm not going to
kill him, baby.

I'm just going to correct
him and cut his dick off!

Balls right off!

Please, don't!

Did I say you could
talk to me, you he-male?

Just don't cut it off!

Why?

Why?

You would look so much
better as a woman!

[Music playing]

Look at the pretty,
little [inaudible]!

You're crazy!

I'm crazy because I don't want
to see my daughter get hurt?

Maybe I want to get hurt.

Did you ever think of that?

Maybe I hate my life so much
that I want Bundy to kill me!

I won't!

I promise!

Why do you hate
your life, baby?

I want to die because
I... I was molested!

[Gong banging]

By who?

Your father?


By uncle John?


Come on over here, Gina.

Let uncle John clean
that hairy Gina.

Yeah!
Yeah!

Oh, yeah!

Oh, yeah!



You have no clue, do you?

Oh, this is so good.

This is so good.

Grandma, that
was inappropriate.

Shh.

That is our little secret.

Oh, you are so
sweet, so innocent.

But you're hurting me.

Hmm.

Let me give you some to try.

It's granny's milk.

It's going to help you.

Try.


No.

Say it isn't so.

Yes, it's true.

Grandma molested me!

And you had no idea because you
spent all of your time hating

Men instead of loving me!

And now I just want to die.

Oh, baby.

So do I.

What?

You do?

But you know what?

We're going to do it ourselves.

We're not going to
fucking let a man do it.

Not a chance!

Fuck Bundy, OK?

Fuck you, Bundy.

Fuck him.

I'm never let another
man hurt us again.

We're going to kill ourselves.


[Music playing]

Mom, I'm scared.

I know.
Don't be scared, honey.

Don't be scared.

You'll be fine, OK.

Just take the knife.

GINA (OFF SCREEN): Oh my god!

Take it, baby.

Do it.

Come on, baby.

Come on!

Squirt it!
Yes!

Come on!

Cut!

Deeper!

Deeper!

Deeper!

Deeper!

Deeper, baby, deeper!

Yes, yes!

Deep!

Let's squirt him in the face.

You are some sick bitches.

Oh, yeah?

Eat this, motherfucker!

We're not sick,
Bundy, we're women.

We're women.

We're women!


We're women, say
it with me, honey!

(IN UNISON) We're women!

We're women!

We're women!

Women!

[Music playing]

VIRGINIA (OFF SCREEN):

[Music playing]

Get the fuck out
of here right now!
