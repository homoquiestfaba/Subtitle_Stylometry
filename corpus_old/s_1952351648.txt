Hi, I'm Tripp.

I live in New York.

Not the city, but the north wing,
peripheral,

where all have a happy marriage in
behind a white fence.

I know how it feels to be married.

You're married, David?

Yes, and we are a happy marriage.

Well, to begin.
Let 's go.

Well, in a Saturday afternoon,

just finished lawnmowers,
after I went and got garbage washing.

Ordinary things with the wife
my Eve, I instruct.

Evelyn.

Hi. Hi.

Is this tree is a little chubby.

You took your other bag?

My birthday is approaching, so I can a
consider as your gift to me.

Here's what happened that day.

She is my wife, Eva with her red mail Etelä II
ii red shoes, red i jewelry.

She likes red. Likes
for a place in the limelight.

And he is my partner, Gary.
Gary Johnson.

It is the kind of man with a conformation
athletic, like Wall Street.

Name is Gary Johnson
matches you best.

Likes company was founded
and then sell them.

Your idea caught.
I must admit that your idea has caught on.

But you'll need me, pal.

Partners?
Really? Yes.

Me and Gary we decided was established from a
company medical assistance, Medikal.

But I needed money
to attract investors.

I thought I suficienþi 5 million
dollars to put the product on standing.

We also believe that the product can bring
billion dollar industry profits.

In addition, it is for a noble cause. We offer
people without insurance a hand.

We do not sponsor worthy causes.

And nonprofit sites are not
an option.

Gary, you must be careful with words
American speeches.

We started on the scene investments

but not with visions or play
grand ideas come.

Angela Gary's contact with investors
has decided to help.

Definitely something you watch, but
Think you better how to Bring Customers.

Meanwhile I will try to
find investors.

So he chose to help us.

What do you have?

I think I heard enough.

If we form the right team,
gentlemen, we immediately move to investment.

We just have enough money to keep business
standing for one year.

Then I did some hiring.

Such as frame.

Never ... never told me not
and that I was not drunk.

But the problem was Eve.

I want to be with a guy
there is no point to life.

I thought you could go back
back to the hospital.

No. Not even the so simple.

I do not sustain too much at first.

Until he read an article.

Young millionaires under 30 years
Online sexy bomb.

And you can be a sexy bomb.

There has always been and a.

When I was a doctor in Philadelphia ...

Can you learn it on my husband and
thing?

and touched the wrong areas ...

I apologize ...

I finally reached when the
I had to take a decision.

I could combine with a lot of women
as my colleague Damian.

Thanks This one site, you combine
ten times easier, man.

Or I could get married.

A woman I find my way,
not like that, through dating services.

Looking for a woman with whom to marry,
not just ... I sleep with her.

Claire, do you think we can exit from a juice
tonight?

I'm sorry.

Marriage seemed
a better option.

Here are you?
Yes, two years ago.

I need to find someone to
feel attracted to me.

Mary, you're a whore.

It's my brother Chico.

What are you doing with this guy here?

Hi, how are you?
Hi.

That e. ..
Do not worry I changed my sex.

Just when I calculate my options.

Eva, who was nurse at the same hospital
I wrote on the dating site.

Probably after I saw the local newspaper.

For me?
Yes.

Thank you.


Had not.

Of course that had.

Money and power does not impress me.

I like simple things in life.

They even offered to pay consumaþia.

If the note comes meantime,
I pay it.

And then ...

Poftiþi note, sir.
Thanks.




I felt wonderful.

And me.

Sorry, I can not do that.

Excuse me.

I, I ...

Do you have a gum or ...
No. Get involved too much and i. ..

I promised myself that I gonna have physical contact
unless a man marry him.

What do you mean?
Good night, Tripp.

And I got married to me.

Not find one
ies and gentlemen of honor.

Rowan.

My cousin Rowan,

was not seen with good eyes when he stole
ies and one of princes of honor at the wedding.

It was the first person I
say about my idea

to founding his own company.

If I have one for each bãnuþ
idea that out of the bottom

I would billionaire.

What is that idea of yours?

Well ... medical plans are obsolete.

15 years ago gave
indemnities doctors.

In 80 'the first people increase.
Okay, listen.

You're somehow Greek?
Because history does not interest me.

Tell me the idea.

My idea is to have 401 types
health insurance accounts.

So, you mean medical organization
is great, and you want to keep.

I stick, I like.

When was it covered?
See, that's the good part.

Yet no one working on it.
There is a legal framework.

You should talk to Gary Johnson.

He has helped to raise Uncle Aaron
some money for his company.

That is why I gave up being a doctor.

There seems to be a huge cylindrical object
stuff in your colon

Your idea caught.

Then I hired Rowan to help us
to bring in sales and customers.

It's good bad.

I wonder how's the weather down there?

What?

No matter.


Let's play chess.

Excuse me, I move first.

He moved us when we did
children how to maintenance plans

and how to manage costs.

We have two cars.

We sell one.

Which?

A to rain.
I hope not.

What the hell does that mean?

Tripp, can your tell you?

Sure.

I want to understand that I
personally involved in your situation,

reasons that I no

I want to know I do not do this for money.

They do this because I want to help people.

And I'm here because I want to help.

Understand?

Yes, I think so.

I mean,
I am here because I want to help.

All right.

All right.

How's the book?

Noisy neighbor to the toilet.

The book is amazing.

It's the way it should be.

Yes? How?

Informative, buddy.

I say what I want to know about

as women learned to behave
the type to be combined.

A wife must not take possession
such information, right?

I do not relate to things and a.
Take care, depends on women.

Do not have time for this to
Holidays.

My client has a row of drinks
because we won the case.

Congratulations.

Dave Carroll.

Yes, yes, well done Dave.

Knowledge Charmed, I'm Rowan.

And seek not a lawyer, because

and not be accused of malpractice.

Just to get to the point.
I suppose that you do, you're a lawyer.

I got the right marriage
with divorþurile.

Congratulations.

I enjoyed you.

Wait a little, actually ...

and it involves the protection of property.

They are king in the protection of property.

Not allow me to take taxi,
What are you talking me here. Wait!

Well, you-gonna tell you something.

I hope not to become too complicated.
Tell me honestly, what chances do I have?

It's about trust.

In whom you trust more

If you want to do this?
David, nice to see you.

Good to me I'm glad to see you.

See you later.

Who was David?

and you call every hour to check yourself.

You think you know all, do you?

Honey, I read as a book.

There are countries you like to.

You'd be surprised how
I can be imprudent.

I was naughty.
It's a nice girl.

All right.
Because I am not thought it was.

Would you get and explain, but you're married.

Yeah, like that is, are married,

goddamn drink.

Well, I do not know what talk.

All leaves after you pay them drink.

How did you know that I
I wanted to be friendly.

Consumaþia girls guys they pay.

Can we stop a minute?

I think the other side of the case that
we need to focus is your picture.

You understand?

Yes, I think so.

Iara and you?

You can not stay away, do you?
I have something unwise for you.

Let me guess. A to
run together on a field of daisies.

I mean, I can do that.

Well, can you give us
note and leave.

Let's see.

What?

How your rash appears?
Jokes are?

That's yours.

Thanks, I appreciate.

Pleasure is mine.

Now to begin, should you pay me
a fee of $ 10,000

and to sign this contract.

Here and fee agreement signed.

Wonderful.

We're gonna take that as a
vote of confidence.

Evelyn.

When me and Rowan we returned from Chicago
then I found the letter from Dr. Turner.

Come.


Thank you, Dr. Turner.
You're welcome.

Goodbye. Sorry.

A. Close the door

Yes.

Was a patient.
A patient perseverance.

A very patient perseverance.

My name is Tripp.

Sit.
Thanks.

What brings you here?
I think know the one on my wife, Eva.

I think when you met
Evelyn has been presented.

Yes, unfortunately my sound familiar
name.

God.

Are you married her?

Poor you, amãrâtule.

I apologize.

Perhaps you're a doctor.

Because that's the only reason
who would marry you.

Are you a doctor?
Yes, I am a doctor, but do not understand ...

View.

Maybe it's something personal but I
found this letter ...

Assume that you have written it.
Let me see.

What?

It's a male.


I'll thank you.

I wrote this letter when
broke the engagement.

Now there is nothing for me.

So you've been logodiþi?
Fucking bitch.

So you've been engaged to her?
Yes.

You must know I was logodiþi.

I let her move in with me after
what and lost his job as a nurse.

I remember one thing and
namely that after six months ...

we got engaged.

That we have not seen
signs.

What signs?
Those with "danger."

Signs of hell.

My things have started to disappear from
cabinet and was replaced with hers.

My things have disappeared into nothingness.

Bills from the restaurant started
to grow rapidly.

I read mail, follow me,
I'll sign the checks.

My checks.

A lot of things. Must
to be very careful at these things.

Do you suddenly realize that your life is not
May I'll belong.

I was disoriented.

Welcome ...
But then I read an article.

There was something
called "test with the island.

Island ...
Test the island.

What was this test?

What you need to do is
women go on an island ...

at a resort.

In fact, this resort is next
The ravine where one can stand you.

Ravine, that is a bad place, a
Fri gay place.

Minus two star motel located
Besides that wonderful resort.

Then you say that you can do a lot of
money. You're filthy rich type.

That are reached.

And I expecting to see how reacts
she stands in another place.

A smart thing.

Sun Sounds of avarice.

You think that's stinginess.
You know what it means to be stingy?

To think about the diamond that are
it's cursed, it's yours,

but really it starts with him and
not see him ever.

And yet something, I hate to say that your,
but you, my son,

gonna get to you live in a caravan,
near a river.

He and the one to get.

But, given the rules man
and that we are men,

you could you live in a caravan
Kim, Karen, Christine.

If you're smart, of course.

Not sure if you do know better, but

I could to ask for advice?

BGIN No, what the hell I know

Has convinced you to buy a home?

Yes.

First mistake.

over a long period.

I wanted your take something.

The other was very nice, but
this is very nice.

You signed a contract prenupþial?

No.

Well, you know something ...

Well not to me it seems funny, Dr. Turner.
You're an exploratory robbery.

All I can do for you, son, is
to show you where to buy your a caravan.

Okay?

Because you have burned.

Then I realized that man's existence
is measured depending on the value of

and depending on how much worth
his wife for him.

I agree with you.

Excuse me, what you read there?

Read the palm of your client.

And what say?

It's confidential.


And surrounded by a layer
tractable imaginary.

We provide such incentives
materials members ...

We will give points, discounts,
meal vouchers, you understand ...

Have questions?

I have a question.

How is called your plan?

On the way to the next meeting
we got lost.

Do I have to stop
look on the map.

Wisconsin interesting stop.

State ...

You know, it's weird because we went back a little.

Had to virãm to ...

Tripp, boy, suddenly yearn traffic
the city from midday

after taxi drivers and drug addicts ...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

But first I think I put a chicken
sleep to escape the cynical landscape

and as you are the one who decides

if you have any club meets the night
way, you must stops.

I do not want to go to any
nightclub.

At conventions, nightclubs are ...

are interesting in a way ...

Listen, rule number one:
do not become a customer forever.

To record?
Yes. I joked.

Hi. I am Tiger Lilly.

How about a dance?
No, and I part of something and at home.

My girlfriend exotic dance practice.
Really?

She says she does not count money
but makes the customer how to feel.

And you do not mind that girl

Not at all.

It's an excellent job,
Hambar and make money and i. ..

He and the is.

My friend is jealous.
Too bad.

Show me your palm.


Do not you be embarrassed, it's okay,

You're crazy.
Wait a little, you see.

I do not want your heart broken, but not
to the law there anything ...

and i. .. it looks like her child.

He and the is.
I have a little girl of five years.

Wonderful.

Do you realize it only if
you look at my hand?

Wait, that there's something else.

Let me see ...

See that line?
Yes.

I say that
Do you will change careers soon.

Medical assistance that will be ...

or ... minder.

I do not believe.

Talk seriously? I work here as you
save money for school assistance.

Honey, I write here.

It's very simple.

Let me just watch once.

This is crazy.

You have done alone
at an early age.

Who did that?

But it looks like you'll be fine.

Motherfucker is an alcoholic.

She always said that if you want something
You can obþii.

I left home at age 15 and
I have not talked to him since then.

Read not say anything.
It's too much and do not think you can endure.

No, do not stop. I want to know, tell me.
No.

I'm done.

Should continue in other

Have you eaten?
No, but I can not go.

Okay, Tiger Lilly ...

you are against isteaþã,

if you deal we will be at buffet
the corner at midnight.

Take care.

You see? I have not spent any money.

One can exit with a stripper
tonight?

Why not?
It's cool.

Yeah, like that is, but when you started
to read in your hand?

Well do not read, that's the beauty.

I mean, what is this?

About an abusive father, a child ran
home, a possessive boyfriend ...

It's the same story.


Need to read target.

Your client, whatever it may be, that the
I want to combine.

Exotic dancer:
Do not leave impressed, not become a customer.

But did you say that you meet with other
Stripper in New York.

Yes, it is a retraining.

If you say that you meet with a
Another dancer

Think about it why can not it afterwards.

I knew it the guy at bar
that I saw when I entered.

Need to know are ground.

Where you know all this stuff?

You know what, forget it, you are married.

He and the E, all right, yes. We should
Consider planning the first customer.

I love you. I love you. I love you.

I know it will be successful

the great job.

You want them to show you what I'm watching.

Brazil.

There would have to go on vacation.

Interesting.

Good luck, cousin. The meeting was the shit.

Where the hell was your head?

I think Eve.

Eve? What about her?

I do not know, does not seem to have a stable
marriage in the true sense and

feel that it sometimes pull the strings.

You could say that your first day.

Thanks.
Yes.

Men like you are easy prey
women like her.

Easy prey? What?

How to approach a woman
Why talk to her?

I do not approach the women, Rowan,
I am married.

Let us pretend a little.

How did you start talking? What did you say?

I do not know. Probably
"Hi I'm Tripp. What is your name?"

And what she should do,

chiloþii give you-and down-and open to
feet and beg you to have a go at home?

Obviously not gonna happen like that,
ie ...

If you want to get me her number
phone him and a compliment,

or give him something to drink and hoping
this time not to leave.

According to reality.
And others do exactly as men.

Like most men.
Yes, I believe it.

Let 's get it otherwise.

Say ... to say that a sexy girl
begins to age 18.

Puicuþa sexy:
Keep easily impressed. Expensive

Is part of the approach, perhaps
5 times per day.

Lost your phone number.
I say it again?

Hi baby. Can your offer you a drink?

Hi.

That means it will be addressed
140 times per month.

Until the age of 25 years will be
approached 12,000 times.

The 11 093 times
Yeah, whatever.

Look at me
that you understand what I mean.

What do you exit the Evidence?

I do not know. I say it's beautiful.
Finish.

It's beautiful.
I think it has not said that?

They will not be told compliments.
They feel they have a high value.

Because it must exit
in this world.

Should look different than me.
Look at me.

Slightly different.

Just do not want to be that guy in the club
shirt in stripes

the eyes of steel, with a beer
without alcohol in my hand,

behaving as if your would be afraid to
talk to women who pass away.

Good, and how does this relate to my wife?

Women like Eva did not like to be attracted
men like you

not a good situation.

Why, because it is beautiful, or
because I said I think is beautiful?

Has no link with
it's beautiful.

I have to ask, why
Eva loves you.

Be careful, my friend Zan approach.

Zan is the master naturaleþii.

Zan, what are you doing?
Nice to see you, man.

He is my cousin, Tripp.

Tripp I'm Zan.
Master naturaleþii.

Why sit here alone
the beautiful women there.

There is beauty and paradise
I sit here.

Talk.

Yes, what?

Tripp's talking about his attraction.

Attraction? It's very simple.

A man who likes women is
liked by women.

Will be attracted to you
like a moth to light.

All will be part of a
romance.

How is your story
love, Tripp?

You see?

You must create a little magic.

Look at him. In three seconds he disappeared.
Is the rule of three seconds.

See a girl that you like?

In 3 seconds go to her and tell her
anything you ask any. No matter.

Hoping to win-your fear.

They feel fear.

Apparently there is a fear in my heart,
I have inherited her over the years,

probably when I was hunters.

If talking to a woman who belonged
another man, our life was endangered.

I condiþionaþi of this fear
get closer to women.

No more fear of it, trade off
it, now you can protect the ego.

It's about confidence.
Look at Zan.

See how to behave naturally? Fineþea
it makes women feel comfortable.

Displays a smile.

A to learn ... can.

Vegas, baby.
The real attraction America.

Here we stay?

No, stay there.

See that motel?
Got a room there for both.

That game that you play it with me women
business can help you finish.

Who knows, maybe if I knew it, I'm Eva
loved for who I am.

Rowan, I learn?

What?

What?
You play practice ...

No, no, no ...
I'll learn?

Tripp, I know what open marriage,

not save them, not fix them.

May consist of all kinds
As you see you.

Where I know what you're gonna learn not
're gonna uses to track women?

I know are pretty good.

Well, then you must your
change the style.

But that is not my style at your convenience?

Rowan.

To use his game to Rowan
business end, seemed a good idea then.

But that means to change my attitude
faces of Eve, to be successful.

As I said earlier,
It comes down to that question

"In whom you trust?
The man or woman? "

There was and image problem.

I could not tell Eve that was
to learn from Rowan.

Let the games begin <i> </ i>

First Impressions: Image, style and identity.
Who mind more, women or men?

You see?

Yes. You saw, did you notice
What happened?

Yes, me I opened the door and
She has looked at you.

Exactly. We created a picture in her mind.

The image of a villain, but no matter,

because it can turn anytime
in a conversation.

Tripp ...

He is Sugardaddy.
Shit.

Man is costumaþie professional,
is a merchant of style.

Merchant of style?

You are the AFC?
AFC?

Yes, medium-sized fellow frustrated.

Get glasses, man.

Hell, no.

That you your matches, gigolos.


That's cool. Yes.
I agree with you, man.

Tripp, boy, get in game tonight.

The best names are Latin.

I've chosen Ricky. He and introduce myself.

To me and I choose a Latin name?

No. You are going to be Max. Yes.
Max Stout.

A friend of mine in England.

And do not forget the accent, is very important.
Women love the accent.

Exactly.
I show an exotic edge.

Find your noisy?
Yeah, yeah, drink?

Top: attraction, comfort are built,
Seduce and conclude.

See ring that.

I call it seducþiei ring.

Attraction: demonstrates that you
value to attract women.

Take all fears, all doubts
worries about the tone of voice,

penis size and everything you
makes you feel unsafe you

and enter them in the ring.


Put it on your finger and uses it as the force
that makes you move forward.

Okay, what's up with the set?

Women do not ever go alone.

Set of 2 means a group of two women.
Set of three means three women, and all the and a. ..

I understand reading.

If there is one man and one group is
AMOG, the male of the group.

Do you understand?
Yes.

Target is the woman that you like the group.

Stay away from a group of two women alone.
You must have joined a friend.

Why?
Because your friend will sustain.


When approaching a group of three women alone
while you talk to one,

will remain and the other two.

Yes, yes.

The male of that group,
You say you want to knock him.

Find out who is and tell him
some deterrent.

Man, I like your shirt.
I had and I just in a school.

Cool, man.

I want to go to the bar girl.
You see, the blond?

I want to ask who remember more
man or woman?


Hi.
Hi.

Who remember more man or woman?

Men lie more, asshole.

Ladies, can I ask you think?

My friend who talk about
remember more, she gives the man.

Man.

The situation with Eve.

Anyway, I suggested to visit

Welcome to Association men

Come, sit down.

Let me tell you my story.

A blond girl, Sexy,
wanted to marry me.

With me! What if it was sexy.

Then I found out ...
Good to meet you.

Then I learned that one child.
A child of six years.

So I've adopted child.

When we adopted child, I learned
that sleeping with everybody in the city.

So I what I did?
I filed divorce.

Then I clean the cow all.
Let me tell you how.

Pension they have paid and maintenance.

and I met a woman.

pregnant and that should get married.

I showed him the paper demonstrate
that we vasectomy.

She sued
for child maintenance

saying that I agreed
with a sperm donor,

by chance
was guitarist in a band.

I found out that the value of a company

is based on when
action for divorce is entered.

A so I expected that my wife
to introduce the first action of divorce.

We used bait money.

Function! But now my wife
I sued asking for more.

I risked everything trying

and now I'm in the process of selling a

I want to cureþe.

Well, it's not rocket science, is not it?

It's very simple.

You are to receiving a large amount
money, and want to divorce.

Yes, basically ...

And like you, your answer the next question
"No," I signed a contract prenupþial.

I found out that the value of a company

is based on when
action for divorce is entered.

Eva refuses to leave
to use me for money.

The only way
she could receive more than

was if I were selling company
When divorce was introduced.

I knew Eve play games.

So I've gathered enough evidence about
it where we need to process.

I needed Eve
to introduce the divorce action.

That do not appear to try to divorce
before I sell my company.

You know? A problem of reason.

Doctor, may want
let us share the story are yours.

Sorry, this is not for me ...

I decided to meet
Samantha in Las Vegas.

It was an easy job.

He's created and accounts as and when it was me,

to try and prove that one in it.
But I records

Look, look for a mail ETA

Enter the house.

Come, come.

Hey, Rowan, Eva just went home.

Come here in ten minutes.

Let's do it my way.

I can not believe I did not know
what it represents.

Wear it on the ring finger. You know you're

Since you do not ...
Give it to me.

Thanks.

Look closely. Do you see those two over there?

<i> I can not say what your talking about,
I can advise ...</ i>

<i> Here is the job.
You slept with my husband ...</ i>

You had one night ... blessed ...

Did The tricky.

Shit.

My husband and me in the wrong
Samantha Backinsale.

<i> judecãþii Day
3 years, 6 months after marriage </ i>

I found her phone number
the call list.

Charges are true
of your past?

Tripp of knew all about me
maiden.

Now says he did not know.

It's a girl involved, is not it?

Fiona.

I found them sitting together
in a hotel room.

Lady, you have no proof
that of the husband did wrong and Samantha?

Telephone records
and ticket.

Because you have also accused
because of the tricky you Fiona.

Write here your detective's report,

that Tripp and Fiona,
evening at which you referiþi,

served dinner
and he has not noticed any physical contact.

And that he has pursued a movie.

Fiona Where to watch movies,
and my client slept the whole movie.

Then accuse them, and spent the night
together in a hotel.

Here you actually write that
had separate rooms.

Ms. Judge is everything here.

I mean, the facts speak themselves.

Tell us please
Your version of the stories you know.

Love is
the increasingly rare nowadays.

It seems that people

they are so insecure

prefer that you lied about
who really are.

Just to be accept
and avoid being judged.

So you think the lay Eve?

Yes, but who do not mind?

I mean, there are individuals who learn
the men to lie to attract women.

And there are women's magazines
with titles like:


"How to PACA are your man
to marry. "

I mean ... PACA it are?

Since people have pãcãliþi
to marry?

It seems that we as a society and
promote lies

and appreciate those who use them
love their personal benefit.

You see, Eve I saw in a magazine

who wrote
promiþãtori younger doctors.

And hired a detective,
long before we were married,

like to learn more about me.

And and has made an account with a profile

which exactly matches
what am I to a woman.

I realized only during divorce

that she wanted to find a man
not have a good opinion of himself.

It later to have money.

You mean ...

what he really wanted Eve
was money in exchange for love?

Yes.

And honesty is the difference
between the front of my marriage with Eva

some random woman
that would come to me to tell me:

"Hey, look at me, are superb


pays me 2000 per month
and your wife will be for five years. "

I mean, I choose
the two versions ever

but this is not about money for me.

That is about love
between my daughter and me.

Bravo.

Son, this is a courtroom,
which presents the facts.

There is a scene for your soap opera
or your director.

Ms. Judge, I submitted all the evidence,

but at this point I would like
to add some evidence

proving that Mrs. Stout
having an affair with Mr. Gallo's,

who is director of a company
worth 20 million dollars.

This ... This is a lie.

A friend owns the company
which cleared Ms Stout.

What has materialized
evidence filed in court.

Look in the hearing today,

do not know any infidelity in marriage.

No more questions
This witness, Ms. judge.

Feel free, you can descend.

Tripp is the man with whom you have met
in Las Vegas in this room to court?

He is.

What was the nature of your meeting?

I called the Vegas.

My plane was delayed,
but we arrived at the club at 9:30 PM.

We met and we have hot ...

I went to his hotel
at around 11:00 PM

where we had sex.

I even did photos
but we have lost.

You lose these photos, right?

Yes.

So someone does not tell the truth.
Either you, or my client.

Ask me which of you.

Ms. judge, please ...

I managed to catch a plane.
You can check.

Excuse me, Ms. judge.

For the last time,
Mr. and Miss Backinsale, you ask:

Are you sure you have slept
my client?

Yes.

All right.

Ms. judge, I want to make
rather than a proof,

You know what it is.

<i> "That night" 10:40 am </ i>

This is outrageous, Ms. judge!
Quiet!

Here, in this device, Ms. judge,

are many and interesting photos
of Rowan's Samantha with Mr. Sly.

That and spent the entire evening
My client

evening in question.

The first photo is taken at 10:03 PM

and the 12th and last at 8:05 PM.

I think you can tell
that means all night, Samantha?

Ms. judge, where we know
that did not have any technical trick

and changed its photos?

Besides, we have evidence
indicating that Dr. Stout

paid him and Mr. Do Backinsale
two tickets to Las Vegas.

Show intention. Also, my client,

sue him
demanding full custody ...

Do not give to my daughter.
Can you take all the money.

Quiet!

Quietly in the courtroom!

<i> Level 5. Almost. You won.
You conquered your fear monster. </ I>

Now follow the path sinceritãþii <i>
to redeem-your love. </ i>

We have a legal system.

50-50% share of the common property

Assess the value of company
depending on the date the divorce.

That means 16%.

There will be maintenance for the wife pension,

pensions and child maintenance
will be calculated according to the law

18% of your income

over a period of 18 years.

Both must have care
Your daughter.

And session is suspended.

Thanks, David.
It was my pleasure.

Not bad having regard to the circumstances
and that is my first trial won.

I'm happy
that we obtained joint custody ...

What? Excuse me,
just said the first trial won?

Yes. I'm sorry for that.

You see, two years ago when I was broker

I went through the same thing
through which you now

and then I decided to become a lawyer.

Same thing ...? Have you divorced?

Yes.
But you told me you're married.

Yes. You know, the whole thing
the Bar, customer ...

It was a trick of "Shark."
Had to know the whole story from you.

I think you're really a "shark."

Tripp, see that statue?

Lady Justice.

Is blind, but is a woman.

See ya.

All right. Would you tell me about Fiona?

If David was not save you
you lost all your money.

Yeah, I know, I know ...

Look, I put in something

not supposed to do from the beginning.

But did I tell about it

because I knew what you were told.

You know, to make a deal
still as I could.

Do not say anything, so I ...

Tell me what happened.

After I separated from Eve

Fiona called me
A few weeks later.

Yes, come to New York five days.

We're gonna be in around?


No, you know, actually
I move into a new house.

So I how about this ...

How about take a trip somewhere?

I did not want to attract money that we.

I even changed machine
with a neighbor like to go to see it.

You live with your parents?

Yes, living with mother in Los Angeles.

It's nice.
Yes.

You understand that your parents
no longer together?

Do not ...
What is your father?

I have not seen for two years.

I bet that even
and no longer remembers me.

It must have been difficult, you know ...

You're growing without a father ...

Yes. Yes, it was, but she was amazing.

He had four children and two jobs.

And is a super mother.

But you?

And you've lost someone?

My brother when he was seven years ...

Her insurance company refused to pay
a procedure that would have saved lives.

Sorry to hear that.

Because of this work
for a company in the field of health?

I never said everything.

You just knew that work at a company,
that do not possess one.

Or that I do not I call Max Stout.

Hey ...

You fell asleep as soon as the movie started.

Well, I did not sleep
too much lately.

If you want, can I call to my hotel
wonder if having a camera in addition.

I'm glad I never went home.

Yes. And me. Here you will be safe.
Yes.

I like me worry about you.

Here is ...? Yes ...
Yes.

All right. I felt good.

Yes ...
Talk on the phone.

Right. See ya.
Okay.

Yes, but the meeting could be better.

You know ... However, it was beautiful.

Wait. What could be better that is?

Well, you know ...

Fiona knew that going through a divorce?

Yes and no. I mean ...

Every time I went
Los Angeles Business meet.

And, you know ...

eventually we needed it
was more than she needed me.

What do you mean you took it
was more than she needed you?

Well, I was depressed, and she was next
me when I needed it most.

But one minds ...

You know, Eve, just as I lay on me.

So I finally
I decided to tell the truth.

<i> and Max's trip to Fiona </ i>

Welcome ... company in which ...

Not only working on it
but possess and sell.

Listen, if you want You find love
again, you must go after Fiona.

Or you can have all other options.

Where you going?

Yes ... Sit down.

You must do this alone this time.

Do you want a chance to explain everything.

Well, I ruined everything

I can do that.

Can you please just listen to me?

I can ...

I tried hard ...

And I can not.

I can not, because they see
you're a nice guy.

Do not understand why the feel that you must be
else than that you are love.

You know, when you said that day that ...

that lay me,

I have broken my heart.

Fiona, I'm very sorry.

I think ... I do not know, I forgot
what is real and what is a game.

You know? But this is not a game.

This is real.
