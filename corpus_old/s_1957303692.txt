September 1943,
after four years of war,

the entirety of Europe is now
under German domination.

However, with Allied victories
in Stalingrad and El Alamein,

the tide of the war
seems to be turning.

But it will never
turn in full until

the Allied invasion of Europe.

With the French coast
still an impenetrable fortress,

the best way in is the enemy's
soft underbelly, Italy.

Fortunately, the landing
in Sicily means British

and American forces are
now lapping at the heels

of the Axis war machine.

Thus, Operation Avalanche
is born.

On September 9th, 1943,
the Allies will attempt to land

in the back door
of the Nazi empire

along the coast of
Italy at Salerno.

To punch a hole in the door
means first clearing

the enemy waters of the deadly
U-Boats and coastal guns.

For that, the Navy will
rely on its smallest

and swiftest vessel,
patrol torpedo boat,

also known as the PT.

While the Allied fleet moves
across the Tyrrhenian Sea,

the only defense for
the PTs are a single ship

of the Merchant Marines.

Comprised of civilian and Navy
personnel U.S. Merchant Marine

fights for the supply and
the men of the U.S. Armed Forces

with all the resources
they'll need.

Tonight the fight,
no less important than

the liberation of
the free world,

will rest in the hands
of that lone vessel,

the S.S. Lawton B. Evans
and her brave crew aboard.

This is our story.

That's that German barge
Irish warned us about.

We got bigger guns.
Should we go in?

Not our job, Buck.
It's a Liberty ship.

We can deliver 10 tons
of K-ration,

lumber and cotton
blankets to Palermo.

Let the warships
take care of the war.

General quarters.

General quarters.

Let's go!
[piping]

[alarm blares]

F-Lighter on target.

F-Lighter on target!

We're on target, on target.

Looks like he's going
to fire the torpedoes.

Those F-Lighters are tough,

but nothing a couple of fish
can't take down real fast.

Okay, man,
prepare the torpedoes.

Starboard torpedo!

Fire!

Portside torpedo!

Fire!

Come on.

Yes!

There she goes.

Direct hit!
Direct hit!

Good work, men.

Direct hit, direct hit.

Got him!
Took about time!

Did you see that, Tommy?

I saw it.
Beautiful, beautiful!

Couldn't have done
better myself.

Four marks.

They got eyes on us!

Shit.

It's a coastal battery!

Get the hell outta here!
Flank speed ahead!

Flank speed ahead!

Hard right rudder, 10 degrees!

Hard right rudder, 10 degrees!

Avoid fire!

[phone ringing]

Redeker!
Redeker!

Full speed ahead!
Full speed ahead!


[gunfire, explosions]

All hands to battle stations!
All hands to battle stations!

All under fire!
We are under fire!

We're gonna lose that PT
if we don't do something now.

Get ready!
Get loaded!

I need to be...
Load up! Load up!

They're sitting ducks
out there, Skip!

Collective fire to the shore!

Repeat, collective fire
to the shore!

Repeat, collective fire
to the shore!

Fire on land!
On land!

Flank speed ahead!
Flank speed ahead!

Skip, that was the last
of our escorts.

Damn it!

We gotta take out those guns!

It's no use, Skip.

I didn't start this fight, but
I'm damn well gonna finish it.

Rapid continual fire
at shoreline now!

Rapid continual fire
on shoreline!

Repeat, rapid continuous fire
to the shoreline!

Let's kick their asses!
Come on! Come on!


100 degrees to port!


Lined up.

Fire!

Reload! Reload!



Recover! Reload!

Recover, recover,
reload, reload!


Agh!

Go check the boilers
for damage!

How is it?

Can't take another one
of those, Skipper.

Charlie, go around
for another pass.

Hard left rudder.
Hard left rudder.

This is not a destroyer, Bill.
We've gotta turn around!

Get us the hell
outta here, helmsman.

Aye, aye, sir.

Let's pick it up, boys!

Wanna finish this detail
before Christmas!

I don't see you helping.

Ah, you're working like
you play chess, Moose.

Let's pick it up.

Think we're taking this baby
all the way to Berlin?

That's not how
depth charges work, Bauer.

All right, ladies.

You got five minutes,
let's pick it up!

Couple of dents
that could use hammering.

Otherwise, she held up okay.

This isn't what I had in mind.

Redeker, I didn't sign up
to get shot at.

Krauts ruin everything.

This isn't the Navy!
We're Merchant Marines!

Well, you'd think the Germans
would grant us a deferment.

All those guardboys topside?

They're the ones trained
for this nonsense!

I'm just here to keep
this baby afloat.

Look, it's all
a matter of luck.

When was the last time you were
back home in Mill Valley?

Let's see. 1941?

Oh, I've been home since then.

And I'll tell you,
you wouldn't like it.

You liar.

You got the prettiest little
family I've ever seen.

That's what I'm saying!
I am fabulously lucky!

You, on the other hand,
not so much.

Look, it's like poker.

Out here, you're a respected
sailor with a full house.

Back home, you maybe
got a pair of sixes.

At sea, you ain't never
getting these aces, kid.

Are you trying
to make me feel better?

Not really.

Mission accomplished, chief.

Hey, I'm always here for you.

I'm like the ship therapist.

I'm gonna start
charging you guys.


I heard things got a
little hairy out there.

How's things on Lawton B. Evans?

Our last escort was destroyed
and we barely escaped alive.

But the ship took
the brunt of it.

We're leaking oil like a sieve

and we'll be vulnerable
until we can repair it.

Sounds like it was hell.

I misjudged the situation, sir.

Oh, bullshit!

The Jerrys have that entire
coastline armed to the teeth.

They been
interrupting our movements

in that sector for weeks.

It's only a matter of time

'til you came upon
a coastal battery.

Now listen, Snow,
I know you had a bit of bad luck

back in Tunisia, but...

I wasn't cut out
for convoys, sir.

I was trained to fight.

Yeah, well, those
fighting instincts of yours

almost cost a thousand men
their lives.

I take full responsibility
for my actions, sir.

I alone am to blame.

That's why I'm gonna give
you a shot at redemption.

Sir?

Landing troops on Salerno Beach
in less than 48 hours.

The invasion of Europe?

Commander?

This is Major General Bradley.

General?

Listen. We're looking
to stick it to Hitler

by taking out
his buddy, Mussolini.

That sound good to you?

Great, sir!

Great. You might have noticed
the coast around Salerno

is heavily armed with
a battery of SS88s,

the toughest gun in their army.

Yes, sir.

We're sending in
two PT boats with commandos

to take out those guns.

We're gonna need your men
to provide

artillery support as needed.

The Lawton B. Evans, General?

That's right.

The Krauts are looking to get
a foothold back in Italy.

Fact is, your little cargo ship

is the most powerful vessel
that we have in that sector.

I won't let you down, General.

You're damn right, you won't.

This is gonna be the single
most important mission

that you and your men on the
S.S. Evans have ever conducted.

Thousands of lives
depend on it.

Understood, sir!

You got 36 hours to get
in there

and knock out all the
enemy vessels before daybreak

or the invasion of Salerno
will be in jeopardy.

Understood?

Yes, sir!

Commander?

Listen, Lieutenant, I know this
is a dangerous mission, but...

I am honored to be chosen
for this duty, sir.

All I can think about
is getting back in the fight.

Well, I guess we wouldn't
want it any other way, would we?

Barnes out.

0600, we're outta here.

Italy.

Hey, hey.

All right, all right, all right.

Chorizo.

Orozco, could we have
some eggs with Spam?

Mr. Ford!
I been looking for you!

Yeah, what do you got?

Well, you know how
we were out of bacon.

You got bacon.

I got something
better than bacon.

I got chorizo.

Never heard of it.

You'll love it.

I don't care about protein.
You know what I want.

Yeah, I know what you want.

I knew you'd come through!

What do I owe you?

Hey, just your friendship,
homes...

Oh, and $10.

Deal.

Hey, Orozco.

When you gonna shave
that moustache?

When Hitler shaves his.


Hey! Come get your eggs!

Come on, Moosie.

Before Snider
does some more sit-ups?

Uh...

Would y'all quit it?

You're giving me
performance anxiety.


Are you sure you wanna do that?

Yeah, why not?

Because.

Go ahead.

What?

Nothing.

Just tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

Hey, you're gonna do it anyway.

No, I'm not.
You're doing great.

Don't listen to me.

You sure?
Promise.

You know, the funny thing
about chess is

if you do the best move too
early, it's a wasted move.

That's right.

You gotta save the piece
with the most potential,

which in this case, is the queen

until you've exhausted
all the other options.

Come on, Moose.
This year.

Aw!

For crying out loud.

You know what?
Put a shirt on!

You're already making
me feel like crap!

I gotta stop betting
on you, Moose.

Be the butt of
the prank.

Come on, fishy, fishy.
Come on.

Bauer!

You think you're gonna catch a
German U-boat with this thing?

It'd make quite a trophy.

Ensign!
I got Barnes calling for you!

Yeah, it would.

Commander?

Ensign Ford?

Yes, sir?

I have a very important
and rather unique request.

I'd very much appreciate it
that you'd keep it

between the two of us.

Of course, sir.

I want you to keep an eye on
our friend, Lieutenant Snow.

I don't understand, Commander.

I know Snow is a great fighter.

I've known that ever
since he and I met

on the battlefield
back in Tunisia.

Toughest in the Navy, sir.

But this is not
the Navy, Ensign,

this is the Merchant Marine.

You've got a fine capable crew.

But you and I both know
that those boys have

neither the discipline
or the training

to go against those
Germans on their own.

And that's just the fight
that he's looking for, sir.

Which is exactly why
I need you to make sure

that he does not jump
out of his frigging boots

at the first smell of combat.

I'd rather not
challenge the lieutenant

in front of the men, sir.

I'm not asking you
to challenge him.

Just be straight with him, Ford.

He'll listen to you.

If there's any problem,
I've got your back on this.

Understood.
Thank you, sir.

And you'll be off the shore
of Salerno in 34 hours.

That gives you 12 hours until
the invasion fleet arrives.

We cannot allow any
diversions to get in the way

of landing on Italy.

Are we clear on this?

Understood.
I will do my best, sir.

That's all I ask.

Ensign out, sir.

Skip?

Irish says by tomorrow,

visibility should
be close to nil.

I heard.

Well, you think that's
gonna interfere with us

taking out those 88s?

They're not gonna call the
invasion just 'cause it's foggy.

Fancy a snort?

Only if you can figure out
a way to get this bucket

to the Italian coast
without it falling apart.

You know we're at the goddamn
mercy of this war, Bill.

Spare me.

You've seen the battle maps.

All of us are just pins
on a piece of paper

the admirals stick in there.

At the end of the day, both of
us are just trying to survive.

And not be that pin
thrown in the trash.

I lost my buddy
because I failed to do my job.

Doug died because he was picked
off by a German U-boat.

I abandoned my convoy
chasing shadows, pal.

You saw a chance.

You had an opportunity to take
out a pack of German U-boats.

If I were in your position,
I'd have done the same thing.

Excuse me, Mr. Snow?

Yeah?

I got a reading a mile east.

What do you figure?

It's pretty big.
Could be a U-boat.

Thanks, Irish.

If we steer clear north a couple
of miles, we should avoid it.

Let's bag it.

Jesus, Bill!
It's a U-boat!

We should steer clear.

This is my command, damn it.

If we can catch that sub on the
surface, we can take her out.

I say let's do it.

Yes, sir.

Tell the men to man the guns
and prepare the depth charges.

The moon's not gonna rise
for a couple of hours.

The bastards
will never see us coming.

Aye aye, Skip.

General quarters.
General quarters.

All men, man your
battle stations.

General quarters,
General quarters.

All men, man your
battle stations.

General quarters,
General quarters.

All men, man your
battle stations.

General quarters,
General quarters.

All men, man
your battle stations!

General quarters, guys.

General quarters.

How's she looking, Irish?

I think we got the drop
on him, Lieutenant.

Should be 2:00, 800 yards out.

Say it!
He shoulda won MVP, is all!

Well, he didn't, so you know!
Who cares?

Does that matter?

Do you always blindly accept
the judgment of your betters?

That, and the Yankees
won the World Series

while the Red Sox finished what?
20 games back?

And that's Ted Williams' fault?

It's called MVP,
Most Valuable Player.

How valuable can Ted Williams
be if the Red Sox

can't win the Pennant?

I'm disgusted, my friend,

that you could be so cavalier
when it comes to the injustice

delivered by the hands of
the Baseball Writers'

Association of America!

I think Robert Feller
should have won.

What?

He had more strikeouts.

Feller? You're an idiot!

Don't you have work to do?

Come on!
I'm not even half-cocked.

Let's get loaded!

Reload, Jeffries!!
Loading!

I confirm that U-boat. 2:00.

Shall we blast him
with a five-inch?

Not yet.
I want to get a little closer.

Is that really necessary?

If you want
a confirmed hit, it is.

I wanna sink that bastard.

Yeah, but the closer
we get to them,

the better chance the Germans
gonna see us

and those U-boats have 88mm.

And I've had a taste of 'em

and I'm not really up
for another one!

Or we can miss and
end up with nothing.

We've got the best gunners
in the Mediterranean.

They can hit an ice cream truck
from this distance!

If you don't like it,
get your own command.

We're goin' in.

Take her slow ahead.
Swell.

Aye, aye.
Slow ahead.

300 yards, Skipper.

I need 12 degrees to starboard!

12 degrees to starboard!

200 yards, Skipper!

Five-inch, lock and load.

Five-inch, lock and load!

Grovener, I'm lined up
and I'm ready to kill it!

Snow, we're locked and loaded!

On target!

Fire when ready.

Five-inch fire!
Repeat, five-inch fire!

Fire at will!
Fire!



Take cover!

Hard right rudder,
full throttle!

Hard right
rudder, full throttle!

Give 'em hell, boys!

[phone rings]

Hard right rudder,
full throttle!

Hard right
rudder, full throttle!


Where'd it go?

I don't see it!

You see it, Grovener?

No, not from me!
What about you, Jeffries?

Nothing over here!
Who's got the binoculars?

Eyes on the horizon!

He's out of sight.

Yeah, give me those.

He is not getting away.

Prepare depth charges starboard.

Aye, aye. Prepare depth
charges, starboard!

Depth charge, Jeffries!
On it!

Get the lead out, Jeffries!
Come on!

Release depth charges!
Release depth charges!

Ah!

Any sign of that sub?

Not on the surface, Skip.

Another 200 yards should do it.

We need to disengage.

Not a chance!

Without the element of surprise,

a Liberty ship is not gonna
do any good against a U-boat!

We've got more guns,
we've got bigger guns.

Simple.

It's not gonna matter if
we can't see the enemy!

Do I need to remind you who's
commanding this ship, Ensign?

No, sir.

Dead slow ahead.

Aye, aye, dead slow ahead!

Slow ahead!

Aye, aye.

Where is it?

Anyone got eyes on it?

No, sir.

Come on, baby, come on.

Hell, that sub
could be anywhere.

He's beneath us.

U-boats can't go faster
than three knots submerged.

If we can't knock him out,

at least you can give
him a wakeup call.

Drop depth charges!

Depth charges portside.

Depth charges portside!

Repeat!
Depth charges portside!

Torpedo! Torpedo!

Torpedo! Portside!


Let's get some distance!

Flank speed, 10 degrees right!

Aye, aye, flank speed,
10 degrees right!

Hard left!
We're turning around.

Aye, aye!
Hard left!

There! There he is!

I see him!

Hey, Skip! I got two Krauts
about to man that deck gun!

Take 'em out! Do you want me
to hold your hand?

Yes, sir!


We've got maybe 30 seconds
before they unload those guns.

Get closer.
Await orders.

But sir...

[speaking German]

Incoming!


Incoming!

What'd I say about
those deck guns, Bauer?

I'm getting my bearings.

Get your bearings faster!


Oh, Christ!
Jeffries is shot!

Come on, buddy!

We got you, kid!
It's gonna be all right!

Come on, now you better breathe!
You ain't got permission to die!

Come on, come on, come on.

No, no, no, no, no.
No!

That's it.
That does it!

Who wants to sink
a Kraut submarine?

I never thought you'd ask.

This ends right here and now!

Collective fire, continuous!

Collective fire, continuous!
Repeat!

Collective fire
at will continuous!

On the right, on the right!
All right!


I'm lined up and
I'm ready to kill 'em!

Fire at will!
Prepare to fire!

Firing!

Firing!

I got him!

Target down!
Target down!

Woo!
Yeah!

Good work, Bauer.

Yeah, we did it!
We got 'em!

Yeah!

We did it!

Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

Looks like Bauer
got his U-boat after all.

Good work, men.
Great work!

Skip?

What is it?

Jeffries is dead.

Damn it.

Donald Jeffries
didn't sign up for this.

None of you men did.

A merchant ship
is built to move supplies,

not to go head to head with
enemy U-boats and destroyers.

But that's what we've
been assigned to do.

No, Jeffries didn't volunteer
for this kind of work.

But when called to duty,
he performed valiantly.

He did what he had to
when he had to do it

without concern
for his own safety.

He wanted nothing more than
to get off this bucket

so he could head home and
take over the family farm.

But he didn't get that chance.

He's not gonna get
to go home because he got

killed doing his job,
his job as an American.

The best we can do going
forward is

to respect his sacrifice
by doing our job

so we can all
get outta this mess

and get back to our families
where we belong.

[radio static]

Commander Barnes?

I understand that
you ran into some action.

Yes, sir.

We lost a man in a fire
fight with a U-boat, sir.

Jesus.

This is exactly what
I did not want to happen.

It couldn't be avoided,
Commander.

Are you telling me there was
nowhere else in the entire ocean

for you to go except head
to head with a German U-boat?

It was us or them, sir.

Lieutenant Snow saw
an opportunity and he took it.

There was no opportunity!

You have a mission!
This is Snow being Snow!

I know you're going to need
his fighting spirit

when you reached that coast,
but not one damn minute before.

Now I want you to tell me,
between the two of us,

can you keep
Lieutenant Snow on course?

I will do
everything short of mutiny

to keep the lieutenant
on target, sir.

But, sir...

But what, Ensign?

We're sitting ducks out here.

And we both know the men
are not combat-ready.

They got a lot of heart, but...

What are you driving at, Ford?

Is there really no help in
the area for us, Commander?

Every damn vessel is accounted
for and you know that.

Any escort would be
much appreciated, sir.

You do your part and make
sure Snow clears that beach

and I'll see if I can
find someone to divert.

Thank you, sir.


Come in!

Those were some nice words
you said out there.

Well, the kid was 19 years old.

How do you sum up a man's life
when he never got to live one?

We wouldn't be burying him
if you didn't take on that sub.

What's that supposed to mean?

We're burying a man at
sea because you're acting

like you have
something to prove.

We had a chance
to sink a U-boat.

I'm not gonna back down
from that responsibility.

That's my job.

Not on this mission.

With all due respect, sir,

your recklessness has caused
a young man to lose his life

when we should be on our way
to Italy to clear that coast out

for our boys invading
so they don't get cut to shreds

by the most dangerous
gun the Germans have!

A PT boat was lost
and an entire crew killed

because I didn't have
the guts to take action!

I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

They were killed because
of your recklessness.

Jeffries was killed because
you didn't listen to your crew.

We're in a war.

You told me yourself
you cannot choose your battle.

You said that.

Well, I was mistaken.

Sometimes you can make a choice.
And you made the wrong choice.

It could happen
to any one of us.

So just stop worrying
about your guts!

You are the toughest man I know!

Are you finished?

I make no promises.

Sir, I have General Bradley
on the radio.

Bradley?
Bradley?

Don't let that go to your head!


Lieutenant, good news!

The Italians are out of the war.

Italy surrendered?

That's right.

Ike announced it 10 minutes ago.

We always knew the Italians
were paper tigers.

They quit the minute
we took Sicily,

which means those 88s are gonna
be manned by crack Nazi troops.

And they never faced
U.S. Navy, sir.

It's gonna be
one hell of a fight.

But I'm counting on you
to take that beach.

I got the best crew
in the U.S. Navy.

So I've heard.

Commander, anything
you'd like to add?

Well, Snow, you can expect
the Germans

to take over naval
operations as well.

Nazis don't miss a beat,
do they, sir?

No, they do not.

You're gonna be faced with
German destroyers and F-Lighters

up and down that coast.

These boys don't play nice.

Neither do we, sir.
Neither do we.

[jazz music plays]

Come on. Act like you
wanna win some money.

He doesn't wanna win.
He's gonna lose.

Give it right here.
Put it on the table.

Hey, how about not
cheating this time?

Yeah, I heard about you.

You know exactly
what you're doing.

Yeah, you're the guy
with three aces.

I don't know why
you're dealing.

He had six aces at once.
Yeah.

I'll tell you what, boys.

With all this money
I'm about to win,

I'm gonna get a tattoo of
my girl.

Oh, yeah!

Romeo!

Hey, Bauer!

Your meatloaf special!

Grovener, you got that?

Yeah, I got it.
Thanks, pal.

You gotta try this.

This is the best meatloaf
in the world.

Well, I don't know what my mom
would do if I got a tattoo.

You know what?

Every one you get
will desensitize her.

I know mine did.

You're gonna love Cookie's
special meatloaf.

Best meal of the month.

Oh, yeah.

I could eat a bear.

Hey, Cookie, you want
in on this game or what?

I need someone with some balls

and isn't afraid
to lose some money.

Ooh!
Hey!

I gotta get back to the kitchen

and make another
special meatloaf.

Take a little bite.

Yeah, yeah, the whole thing.

That's real good, huh?

What you think about that?

You like it?
It's real tasty, isn't it?

What's wrong?

That's not hot.
Keep going.

Owie, that's hot!

Oh, yeah?
It's real hot!

Give me some water!
Give me the water!


What are you doing?
What are you doing?

What the hell, Cookie?

Want to make the meal a little
less spicy next time?


Hey, that's the way we do
it in Texas, okay?

Put a little hair on your nuts!

Hey, where you going?

So getting a hit in 56 straight
games isn't a big deal?

It's a huge deal,
but it's trivia.

Come on, when somebody puts
milk bottles on their heads

and balances 'em,
it's impressive.

But it don't mean
they should be president!

That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard.

Milk bottles?

DiMaggio is the greatest
centerfielder of all times.

But did he bat .400?

I hear the Braves
are doing good this year.

That's just... what?

I'm beginning to think you don't
know what you're talking about.

Get this guy outta here.

Yeah, get out of here.

You're not here,
you're not here.

Who wants to finish this?

Yeah, I'll take a bite. Leave it
right here on the table.

All right, let's go.

Counterintelligence
is now reporting increased

German naval activity
off Salerno.

Looks like Hitler wants to hold
onto Italy as long as he can.

Yeah.

And air reconnaissance
just spotted what looks like

an enemy destroyer opposite
the coastal artillery unit.

I hope Snow
and his cowboys are ready.

They'll be ready, sir.

Think they can handle a Kraut
destroyer with five-inch guns?

Snow's a salty
son of a bitch, sir.

If anyone can, it's him.

Better be right.

Hey! A roof! Now that's
major home improvement!

That's what I've been
trying to tell her.

Yeah.

Definitely something that
she shouldn't try on her own.

It leaks a little.
I get it.

But, you know, put a bucket down
or something until I get back.

I don't wanna be ripped off

because some jerk
knows I'm overseas.

Hey, a guy could take advantage.

Yeah, exactly.

Single woman at home
by herself, helpless?

Come on, it happens
all the time.

Wait. What?
What do you mean?

No. We're in love.
She wouldn't do that, right?

She wouldn't do that.

Irish to the bridge,
Irish to the bridge.

You better go!

Don't try to change the subject!

I'm coming right back!

Hey, you thinking about
swimming to Italy?

I wasn't supposed to get into
another firefight again.

That wasn't the plan,
but here we are, pal.

Well, I been in one war
and that's one too many.

I'd feel the same way if
I served on the Jacob Jones.

Wow, I was so proud to
be manning a four-incher

on a world-class destroyer.

I was good, too.
Boy, I was real good.

So I heard, Cookie.

You know, after
we got torpedoed,

the Jacob Jones
went down so fast,

we didn't even send out
a distress call.

60 men...

60 men lost
in eight minutes.

I swore I'd never be
on a combat ship again.

Well, if it helps,
if it's any consolation at all,

you are the best cook
in the U.S. Navy.

Damn right.

I take care of my men.

If there's one thing
I've learned in this man's Navy

is that everybody's got
their own part of the play.

From the galley to the head
and all the assholes in between

it takes all of us
to make a Navy ship,

even a broken down Liberty ship
like the Lawton B. Evans.

You know what? I'd better
get back to the kitchen.

Okay.

You know, why can't we have
any tequila on this boat?

Because, we're in Europe.

If we get over to Acapulco,
I will get you some tequila.

Acapulco, here we come.

Keep an eye out for any vessels

that might try to
kill us in this mess.

As always, Skip.

Yeah, watch out for some
giant squid while you're at it.

Definitely.
That's the last thing we need.

Not too far from
the coast, are we?

Just out of our radar.

So about 30 miles?

You know, you got
a hell of a crew here.

Best in the Navy and that's not
just something I tell people.

Whoa, whoa, you can't do that.

Why not?

It's not a move.
It's not a chess move.

But it makes sense.

That's where I want my piece
to go, so I put it there.

Knights don't move like that.

Why not?

What do you mean, why not?
Those are the rules.

But...

Ah, jeez.

Can a pawn do that?

Yeah, of course.

Well then, why not
the horse guy?

We've been over this.

The knights
do this L-shaped thing.

Aren't knights more
valuable than pawns?

Yeah.

Then why can't
they move like pawns?

I don't know. Just...

Knights can't do the thing
you're trying to do.

They only move in this L-shaped
way like we talked about.

Whoa, whoa...
Is that better?

Yeah, that's...
Whoa.

Look at that.

What?

What's happening?

Noth... nothing.

Did I just...
Seriously?

Did I win?

You better tell him.
I won, didn't I?


Yeah!

One for Minnesota!


General quarters!
General quarters!

All men, man your
battle stations!

I win!
It doesn't count.

General quarters!
General quarters!

All men, man your
battle stations!

General quarters!

Bauer, we got a destroyer
in the area. General quarters.

If I catch one,
I'll let you know.

Man your post, sailor!


Get us lined up, Grovener.

Get you lined up.
I'll get you lined up.

All right, all right.
We're in line, we're in line.

You sure it's that destroyer?

I don't know, but it's big.

Should we reverse course?

Well, let's pause a while

and see what that thing is
and where it's headed.

Dead slow ahead.

Aye, aye, sir.
Dead slow ahead.

I don't see nothing.

Bauer! General quarters!

I know, but, sir...

We're headlong into
a destroyer, sailor!

Get the lead out!

I got something, sir!

I don't know what it is, but
it's gotta be pretty big!

Well, why didn't you tell me?

Here. Let me reel it in!
You go prep your gun!

Thank you, sir. You have no idea
how much means to me!

Yeah. My God, I'd hate you
to lose your fish.

Thank you, sir.

No!

We're in a war, sailor!

You go man that gun or
I throw you in the drink!

Do you see it?

Oh, God bless it.
I don't hear anything.

Aw, man.

I can't believe that
we're looking for a destroyer

instead of delivering supplies.

If only my old man
could see me now.

I hear nothing.

Do you?

Not a damn thing!

Do you see anything, Grovener?

I don't see nothing, Tony.

That's what scares me.

I know we got
a destroyer out there.

I just can't see it.

What's standard operating
procedure for pea soup?

What I'm doing, moving
as little as possible.

Any update on that ship?

It's close, sir, real close.

Well, lucky for us, Kraut
radar's as bad as ours.

Also need to make sure
we don't drift too close

to the shoreline in
range of those 88s.

Back in Annapolis,
they don't tell you what to do

if you can't see
or hear anything.

That's why they pay you
the big bucks, sir.

I expected more
than $150 a week.

See anything?

No.

I got nothing!

There's something on the radar.

You guys hear that?

Yeah, I still hear it.

It's getting closer.

Destroyer coming right at us!
30 degrees to port!

30 degrees to port!

It's coming right towards us.

Hard right rudder!
Hard right rudder!

Prepare depth charges!

Full to starboard.

Fire at will,
fire at will.

Full to starboard.

Depth charge starboard, now!

Depth charge starboard, now!


Fire! Fire!
Light 'em up, boys.

Fire!
Come on!

Bringing fire.
Firing!

Did we get 'em?


We got men on the shore!

Krauts on the shore!

We found those guns
you're looking for!

They're gonna tear us to shreds!

You think I don't know that?


Take cover!
Take cover! Take cover!

We got shots coming
from shore battery!

I want to see heavy fire
directed to that beach.

Fire all guns!


Reload! Reload!


Firing!

Oh, my foot!

Move out!

Oh, I got it in the foot.
Get off me! Get off me!

Don't you have a job to do?

Shut up, you moron!
I'm trying...

Oh, my goddamned foot.

It's just a nick,
it's just a nick.

Oh, no, you remember Curry?

He almost died when he shot
himself in the toe.

I'm not gonna die.

You don't know that!

Come on, let's get
you below deck.

Get you to see a medic.

Get up, you big lug!

Come on.


Sir, you gotta
watch that portal!

You're gonna take a bullet!

My time will come when it comes.

They better be avoiding
those U-boats!

They'd better!


That wasn't good.
It sounded like the engine room!


Redeker? Are you okay?

I'm all right!
Call top-side.

Clevenger, were you hit?

A shell tore through the side!

Boiler one's down and boiler
two is losing pressure fast!

Can you get 'em patched up?

I can try.

I can try and patch it, but
what about getting to Salerno?

I'll send some men
to work the pumps.

I'm fine!
It's fine!

I'm fine, Tony!

It's nothing, all right?

Let's see how nothing it is.

Oh, that hurts!
How does that feel?

It hurts!
And there?

It still hurts.

Sounds like a ceasefire.
Maybe we're out of range.

Oh, God! What,
are you trying to kill me?

I'm not trying to kill you,
I'm just trying

to make sure you're not dying!

Listen, you can't say
nothing to no one.

I don't wanna get sent back
to Sicily, I'm fine!

Maybe I want you to
go back to Sicily!

Maybe I'll shove
my boot up your ass!

Wait a second! You ain't even been
shot, you got shot in the boot!

Well, it still hurts!

Ah, it works because
you're a wuss!

Come on, get back in the fight!
Here we go.

Chief!
Chief!

No, no.

Hey, we got help coming.

We got help coming,
so just hold on.

I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

What are you talking about?

Clev...

No, I just gotta hold pressure.

Would you just shut up,
all right?

Clev, stop!

Clev, stop.

When you get back to San Fran,

I want you to tell Em and
the girls that I love 'em.

And that I'll see 'em
on the other side.

I will, buddy.

You do that for me.

Yes. Okay.

You're the best friend
I got, Clev.

No!

No, no, no, no,
please, please.

The boys are stemming
the bleeding.

We're powerless
for another hour.

But we'll stay afloat
if we don't take

another hit like that!

What should we do?

We'll never make it out
of here without full power.

Maybe we don't have to.

What?

Cease fire!
Cease fire!

Cease fire?
We'll be sitting ducks!

Or maybe not! What if they think
they already sunk us?

Have the boys throw everything
we don't need overboard,

pots, pans, clothes, pinup girls
and a bunch of our cargo.

I don't care what it is.
The tide's heading in.

Everything we throw overboard
to make it look like we've sunk!

Come on!
Get to work!

Go, go, go, go, go!

I don't care what it is!

We got Krauts firing at
us from all sides.

If it's not essential to
the war effort,

I want it thrown into
the briny deep, you understand?

What if it's
a nice piece of jewelry?

Toss it!
Even if it's real small?

No! Don't worry about it!

Okay, so if it's
a big gold necklace,

for example, we should
throw that in the ocean?

Did you rob
a pirate ship, Bauer?

Well, a small ring,
on the other hand...

Shut the hell up, Bauer!

I want all this stuff off
the boat in the ocean!

So long, trash!

You ever figure what happens
if we still

get discovered by the Germans?

It's the law of averages, Moose.

Maybe they find this stuff,
maybe they won't.

But are they supposed to?

Ideally.

See, I think about
the ancient Egyptians.

They were always hiding things.

And they couldn't
have known whether

we'd find them or we wouldn't.

What's your point?

Oh, nothing.

Just wondering if everything
isn't pointless.

Wow!

We're on a junk detail

and you're getting
existential on me?

[artillery fire]

Scheisse!

Let's get outta here!

Are we battened down?

If they can't fire it
or wear it, sir,

it's headed towards shore.

Let's hope that satisfies
our German friends.

Just unwarranted
is all I'm saying.

Uh-huh.

All right, hand me the Philips.

That fishing pole,

it survived Casablanca,
Algiers,

Tunisia, Messina...

Did you catch anything?

What?

You ever actually
catch anything?

So what if I didn't?

Then the pole itself
doesn't matter much, does it?

I mean, you might
as well have used a baguette.

It's the principle, Irish.

That fishing pole was not
his to throw in the ocean.

Well, he's an officer,
so it kind of is.

[radio static]

Oh, will you listen to that?

Oh, I'm a genius!

Woo!

For the boys working the pumps,

we got maybe 40 minutes
at 10% power.

Make it last.

We have less than 24 hours
until the fleet arrives.

We'll try, sir.

No sign of the enemy.

I gotta hand it to you, sir.

I thought we were goners.

That idea of yours got us out
of one heck of a pickle.

Well, we're not out
of the woods yet.

Captain, I have
an update on the engine.

All right, give it
to me straight, Doc.

Clev says we can't do better
than a quarter power

until we get more parts.

What about fuel?

Do we have what we need
to get back to Sicily?

Probably have enough to get
halfway to Palermo.

Gather the men.
We need to have a talk.

That was quite a melee.

The Krauts hit us
with everything they had

and you boys
performed brilliantly.

Yeah!

You know, I've been eager
to get back to Salerno

to take out those guns.

But the engine room bore
the brunt of the fighting,

and our ship ain't much
without her engines.

Now the boys down below
have done one hell of a job.

But the truth is,
we're down 75%.

And we only have
enough fuel to get us

about halfway back to base.

The way I see it, there's no
choice but to abort the mission.


Hey, lock it down, sailors!

If we try to reach shore
under these conditions,

there is no going back.

I mean, once we're onshore,
we own it or we lose it.

There's no middle ground.

And if we're lucky enough
to survive until morning...

and I say if, there's no
guarantee we'll have enough fuel

to escape whatever fighters or
destroyers they send after us.

Are you with me?

What difference does it make

if we can't make
it back to Palermo?

We have enough fuel to
steer clear of the beach.

We'll radio for a tender.

I'm not crazy about it.

Yeah, I didn't get shot just
so I could go back

to Sicily without
seeing Salerno.

Trying to reach the beach
without enough fuel

is a suicide mission.

I always wanted to go to Italy.

I hear it's lovely.

I can't ask any
more of you fellas

than you've already given.

Skipper, I remember watching
that PT getting hit the way

they did and I've been
sick about it ever since.

Everything we done all night

has been to get back
at the Germans.

We're so close now, it'd be
a crime to have to head back.

Yes.
It ain't just Moose.

I've been feeling the same way.

Skip, we have Commander Barnes
on the radio.

Dismissed, men!

We can't just...
This is too important to...

Do you mind?

Not everyone's a coward
like Marca here!

You got some real nerve.
You know that?

Well, you know what, Boston?
Just shut your mouth.

Oh, come on, buddy boy!

Oh, yeah,
what are you thinking?

I'll make that pretty face
something else!

Hey, hey, hey!

[radio static]

Lieutenant Snow,
we're calling off your mission.

Commander Barnes!
Commander Barnes! Over!

Commander Barnes.
Commander Barnes, over.

Come on...

Damn it! Hello?

Bill, are you there?

Commander Barnes?


Commander Barnes, over.

Snow?

Ford, fix this radio.

Listen to me!

If you can hear me, the two PTs
that were carrying commandos

for the assault were damaged
by Nazi fighters

and had to turn back.

If you reach that beach,
you are going to be

sitting ducks for those 88s.
Do you copy?

Snow, you need to pull back!
Hello?

Give me that!

God...

Snow, you need to get
the hell outta there, right now.

You understand?

Lieutenant, can you hear me?

Lieutenant, you need
to pull back immediately!

Do you read?

He better not blow that.
You understand?

There's 10,000 lives at risk.

Yes, General.

Keep trying.

You better get
these goddamn coms working

one way or the other.
You hear me?

Yes, sir.

Well, men, sounds like this
is the end of the line for us.

You heard the man's orders.

I didn't hear a thing.

We had some kind of radio
malfunction, Mr. Snow.

I didn't hear nothin',
did you, fellas?

I didn't hear nothin'.
Irish?

I tried to fix it, but
you know me, all thumbs.

That last Luftwaffe attack must
have knocked out the radio.

It's been dead ever since.

Don't look at me.

My hearing's shot from
all those depth charges.

All right, men.

Prepare for deployment.

We're about to invade Italy.


Let's get outta here.

Our mission, gentlemen, is to
take out two German 88mm guns

and the location is right here.

About 50 yards south
is another German encampment

comprised of about 40 men.

Then to the north of
that is an encampment

much smaller between
five and 10 men.

If we reveal our position,

they have enough fire power
to blow us sky high.

That's why we plan
to land here,

keeping the Evans safe
from harm.

Now from here, you'll work
your way down to the guns.

Stealth is of the
utmost importance

as you approach the encampment
north of the 88s.

You'll need to take
out the first gun.

Then what's most important

is these men south of it
in this foxhole.

After killing these men as
quietly and quickly as possible,

you can then proceed
to destroy the last gun

before returning to
the ship for cake and soda.

Any questions?

No, sir.

I have to admit I'd say
that's the craziest plan

I've ever heard.

He's right.

Let's go win a war.

We want this short and sweet.
Got it?

We're here to take out those 88s

and we only got
45 minutes to do it!

So we want as little interaction
with the enemy as possible.

The last thing I wanna see is
an entire unit of Germans!

Are you with me?

Ready and willing, sir!
Good.

Now here's some cold hard facts.

If I hear sustained fire
coming from the beach,

I have no choice
but to withdraw.

Do you understand?

You got it, sir!

This girl can't withstand
one more hit

and I can't risk
the rest of the fellas.

Remember, you've got
thousands

of American and British
troops on their way.

So if you get in any trouble,
boys, fight like hell.

Help's coming, all right?

Aye, Skip!

Let's go fight a war!

Hey, Marca?
Sir?

Brew a pot of coffee. We're
gonna need it when we get back.

Yes, sir, with cream.

Lower the boat!

We're about ashore now.

Are you sure they're
still asleep?

They are, sailor.

Better stay frosty.

It's awfully quiet out there.

All right, guys,
get ready to disembark.

Keep your head down,
you stay low.

Moose and Snider, you're gonna
take that north tower.

You're going to take
the satchels.

Bauer and I are
going to take the south.

We meet back here.
Keep your head down low.

Go!
Aye, Skip.

General, with our coms down
and knowing Lieutenant Snow,

I have to assume he
and his crew are proceeding

with the original plan.

If the Lawton B. Evans
is detected,

it could compromise
the entire mission.

Not if we take out those guns.

What are you talking about?

With those 88s out of the way,

you can still establish that
Salerno beachhead as planned.

Barnes, I've gotta get
10,000 Allied forces

onto this beachhead!
Do you understand that?

Yes, sir.
Huh?

And you think I wanna gamble
it with some cowboys

in a cargo ship who think
they can pull off

some commando raid against
an elite S.S. unit?

Is that what you think?

10,000 men at risk!

You think
they can pull that off?

Yes, sir.

I'm calling off the invasion.

General, please!

You gotta trust me on this.

Listen to me.

Snow and I go way back.

He is a hell of a skipper.

And if these boys say
they can get it done,

then, by God,
they'll get it done!

We're not out of this, sir.

Get me General Donahue.

If Snow and his men
don't take those guns out,

it's gonna be your ass.

The Germans will never
know what hit 'em, sir.



Grenade.


What's the plan, Skip?

Prep your gun.
We're moving in.

By the time we're in range
of those 88s,

the dynamite will have blown
them to kingdom come.

All men to general quarters!

All men to
general quarters!

Say again, all men
to general quarters!


Is it set?

Let's move! Let's move!


That ought to slow them
Germans down a little.

Sir, it looks like they just
took out one of the 88s.

Waiting for visual
confirmation on the second.

You guys get yours set?

Yeah.
It should have gone off by now.

This ain't good.

The fuse must have got wet.
I'm going back.

Stay here.
No, Skip, it's too late!

[gunfire, shouting]

I got ya, buddy.
I'm hit!

Come on!

Got eyes, Bauer?

I got you.

Sir, I got two Germans up
on the ridge, 12:00.

Take one on the right.
I take the one on the left.

On three.

One, two, three!

I got him!
Nice shot.

Why is it so quiet?

Maybe they've fallen back.

Maybe we scared 'em off.

[airplane engine approaching]

Incoming Messerschmitts, sir!

Man the 50mm, Irish.

Me, sir?
I'm an engineer!

Make those Nazis
pay the price for

taking on the best damn
gunners in the U.S. Navy.

Yes, sir!

You guys hear that?

You know how in "King Kong"
when all the dinosaurs run away

because they hear
the giant ape coming?

Yeah.

Sounds like they got
their giant ape.

Messerschmitts!

Get down.

It's coming back around!

All right, boys,
might as well go out fighting.

Got enough ammo?

Enough for a couple minutes.

It ain't gonna last that long.

Ready?

Now!

Woo!

Light 'em up, fellas!

Leave no stone unturned
or Nazi unshot!

[shouting, gunfire]

Fire at will!

Moose? I'm not gonna
lose anymore guys.

Get Moose up!
Let's get outta here!

Take him to the shore.

Come on.
Come on, Buddy.

Come on. Come on, come on.

All right.

Ready to get your ass beat
in another game of chess?

Remind me who won...

You two can't quit.

Didn't count, last time.

It's a rematch.

Prepare for that high
elevation shot!

You got it!
You got it!

Loaded?
Loaded! Fire at will!

Woo!

Come on! We got Messerschmitts
coming in hot!

Eat my shorts, Hitler!

Locked and loaded?
Locked and loaded.

Fire at will!

That's what I'm talking about!

Holy cow!
I got one!

Did you see that?

Paul, Jacob!
Get in there, help him.

He's shot!
Watch his leg!

General quarters!

Lt. Snow, there's still
one 88 remaining!

Irish, lend a hand portside!

Let's go!

Welcome back.

Good job!
Let's go!

Move! Move!
You're all right?

I've been better.

Come on, come on.

Drop that gun!
Orozco!

Are you ready to
get back in the fight?

Can I kill Nazis?
I hope so!

Where do I sign, sir?

Man the 20mm!

20mm?
I'm about to kill some of them!

Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Give me something to shoot at!

Skip says to lay down
fire at the coastline.

There we are.



Man down!
Man down!

Get the med kit.

Get some ammo!
Reload! Reload! Reload!

Let's go, let's move!

Come on, come on, come on!

All right!


Messerschmitts coming
right for us!

Take cover!

That was too close for comfort.

Get up, you goldbrick.

Oh, Jesus.

No, no, no, no, no.

No!

Get back in your
position, seaman!

We have to take out
that last 88!

I'm sorry, sir.

My gunner trainer,
Grovener, he's dead.

Can you please take
the point of position?

Copy that, seaman.

Time for some
revenge killing.

I got you, sir.


All right!

On my command...

Time for that
revenge killing, sir!

Five degrees starboard!

Yes, sir!
Five degrees starboard!

Let's kill those Nazi bastards.

On target, sir.

And... fire!

Fire!

Oh!

Yes, yes!


We got 'em!

Way to go, Cap, way to go!

Oh, yeah!

That was one in
a million, Captain!

You happy now, asshole?

Thank you so much, sir.

Grovener would have loved that.

Grovener.

I guess we invaded Italy
after all, huh, buddy?

Not bad for a cargo ship.

You're a hell of a shot, Skip.

The way we're listing,
we're not gonna last 20 minutes.

Well then, let's make it count.


Pleasure to serving
with you, Mr. Ford.

Pleasure's all mine, sir.

Messerschmitt coming in!



Nice shot, Irish.

Thank you, sir.
You ought to be a gunner.


Flight coming in!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Ah!

I got shot in the ass!

Ah!

Medic!
Bring some morphine!

Medic! Medic...

I got you.

Morphine.
Stay calm, stay calm.

I'm always calm!

I'll put pressure
on the wound.

Hey, hey!
Get your hand off my ass!

Stay calm, Cookie.
I just gotta stop the bleeding.

All right.

Tell me the truth.

Am I ever gonna shit again?

Not with this butt.

Oh, I had such
a pretty butt too.

Looks like hamburger now.

Chorizo!
Say chorizo, cabrÃ³n.

Okay, chorizo.

It hurts!

Coming back!

Good luck!

Where'd that come from?

Wait! What's that?

Skip, look! It's our boys,
come for the invasion!

Woo! Yeah!


USA, baby!

Well, I guess I figured
I didn't have a choice.

That's no excuse, Lieutenant.

You were given a direct order
to stand down

when you attacked
those Kraut guns.

You put American lives
at risk.

Yes, sir.
It's entirely my fault.

I take full...

Damn right!
That was your fault.

We didn't have enough gas to
make it back to base, sir, so...

You chose to engage the enemy

in direct violation
of my orders.

We knew how important those 88s
were to German defenses, sir.

Did you or did you not receive
my instructions

to steer clear of the enemy
until further notice?

Um, yes and no.

Yes or no, Lieutenant?

Yes, sir.

Now you listen carefully and you
listen good

because
I'm only gonna say this once.

Although I'm tempted to
court martial your ass,

that was one of
the most brilliantly executed

commando raids
I've ever heard of.

And I've been in
this game a long, long time.

Thank you, sir.

Snow, if you ever disobey
an order of mine again,

I'll have your ass in a sling.

Having said that, and I can't
endorse that behavior...

we will now be in Rome
in less than a week.

Anything we can do to help, sir?

I don't know much, Lieutenant,

but I do know that the U.S. Navy
is gonna need

some top-notch commanders if
we're gonna beat the Japanese.

Yes, sir.

Do you think you could command
a heavy cruiser in the Pacific?

Sir...

We'll be in touch, Lieutenant.

We're doing okay.

They're calling the invasion
"Operation Avalanche."

I like that.

The doc says they're gonna
be sending you home, Moose.

What do you think?

You mean, you'd have to pull
your own weight for a change?

I don't like it
any more than you do.

"The U.S. Fifth Army, working in
coordination with the British,

who landed a division in
Taranto."

Throw in the fact
that Italy surrendered,

and this is big,
very, very big.

Ow.

All right, Moose,
see you in the funny papers!

Aye, aye, you betcha!

Hey, Cookie, wait!

Just, you know, in case you
get in another scrape.

You know me too well, Irish!

Hey, Bauer, Ford wants
to see you in the wardroom.

What does that jerk want?

Ask him yourself.

Marca said you...

You ever heard of
knocking, sailor?

Sorry, sir.


Come in.

Marca said you wanted
to see me, sir?

Bauer, Bauer.

Oh, yeah. Run those charts
up to the skipper

on the bridge for me, would you?

Seriously?

Yes, seriously.

It's all yours, Bauer.

Yes, sir!
It's...

It's beautiful!

I knew you were gonna piss me
off at some point.

But I didn't want you
to be without a fishing rod,

so... you know.

This doesn't mean
we're friends now, does it?

Don't get carried away...
get out of here.

Hey, shut the door!

Sorry, sir.
Thank you again, sir.

Oh, my God.


I'm gonna miss your
philosophy lessons, Ken.

I got a little something
for you

just in case you get stuck
with a pair of sixes.

She all battened down?

She's not sinking anymore.

Small victories.

How you holding up?

Well, luckily, I wasn't killed,
only slightly injured.

Grovener was one hell
of a sailor, wasn't he?

One of the best.

Yeah.

Right or wrong,
when you're captain of the ship,

you have to make decisions

where men's lives
hang in the balance.

It just has to be that way.

That was no accident
those thunderbolts

had their way with the Germans.

The enemy had those 88s,
that wouldn't have happened.

That was your doing, Skip.

Suppose it was.

You think these
actions are gonna get you

back on a warship
where you belong?

Well, if it does,

would you care to be
my second in command?

And miss running fruits
and vegetables up the coast?

I'd be honored.

Let's get this thing
up and running.

Yes, sir.
