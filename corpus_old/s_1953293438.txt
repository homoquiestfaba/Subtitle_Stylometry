<i>[CARSON] I ALWAYS THOUGHT</i>
<i>DEATH WOULD BE DIFFERENT.</i>

<i>I EXPECTED A</i>
<i>GREAT WAVE OF REALIZATION</i>
<i>TO SWEEP OVER ME.</i>

<i>SUDDENLY, THE MEANING OF LIFE</i>
<i>WOULD BE ANSWERED ALONG WITH</i>

<i>EVERY OTHER QUESTION</i>
<i>I EVER HAD.</i>

<i>BUT THERE WAS</i>
<i>NOTHING TO REALIZE.</i>

<i>- I WAS DEAD.</i>
<i>- [DOORBELL RINGS]</i>

WHAT?!
ARE YOU SHERYL PHILLIPS?

WHAT, DID I FORGET TO PUT MY
TRASH BINS AWAY OR SOMETHING?

NO, MA'AM.
YOUR SON HAS DIED.

HIS BODY WAS FOUND
IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT
THIS MORNING.

<i>[STUDENT REPORTER]</i>
<i>A FEW DAYS AGO,</i>

RIGHT HERE WHERE I'M STANDING,
CLOVER HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR

CARSON PHILLIPS
LOST HIS LIFE WHEN HE WAS
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

A SERVICE
WILL BE HELD THIS SUNDAY
AT CLOVER COMMUNITY CHAPEL.

HE WILL BE MISSED.

â™ª IT'S SO HARD

â™ª TO SAY GOODBYE

â™ª TO YESTERDAY

<i>AND...MY FUNERAL SUCKS.</i>

GOODBYE, CARSON.

<i>YOU'VE SEEN MY END.</i>

<i>BUT WHERE DO I BEGIN?</i>

<i>I REMEMBER WHEN</i>
<i>I REALIZED I WAS DIFFERENT</i>
<i>FROM EVERYONE ELSE.</i>

MY NAME IS CARSON.
MY MOM SAYS I WAS NAMED CARSON

BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WAS ON TV
WHEN I WAS CONCEIVED.

WHEN SOMETHING
TAKES AWAY SOMETHING ELSE,
WHAT DO WE CALL THAT?

NOT ADDITION, BUT...
HOMICIDE.

<i>I WAS ADVANCED AT A YOUNG AGE.</i>

MOST OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS

WERE CLOSETED HOMOSEXUALS
AND SLAVE OWNERS.

<i>MY REPORTS WERE ALWAYS</i>
<i>MORE THOROUGH THAN MY PEERS.</i>

I'M SERIOUS.

<i>I REMEMBER WHEN I DISCOVERED</i>
<i>THE POWER OF WORDS</i>

<i>AND HOW EASY IT WAS</i>
<i>TO ESCAPE INTO A WORLD</i>
<i>OF MY OWN BY USING THEM.</i>

IT WAS A PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT.
THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND, TOO.

YOU'RE ALREADY.
AT LEAST LEAVE ME ONE BEER.

CARSON, THIS IS
THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER
SEE YOUR GRANDFATHER!

I KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE!
STOP FIGHTING ME!

STAND UP.

BOO!
AHH!

WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

IT WAS LAME.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

THE KID'S A PUSS.

<i>I REMEMBER THE DAY</i>
<i>GRANDMA CAME TO LIVE WITH US.</i>

GRANDMA!

<i>[NEAL]</i>
<i>IT'S THE FIFTH TIME</i>
<i>YOU FOUND HER</i>

<i>WONDERING AROUND TOWN.</i>

OH, MOM.

AND NOW
SHE'S IN THE LINEN CLOSET.

YOUR BEDROOM IS THE NEXT DOOR.

<i>AND THE DAY</i>
<i>THAT GRANDMA GOT SICK.</i>

I WROTE YOU A STORY, GRANDMA.
OH, LET'S SEE.

"ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A BOY."

WELL, IT COULD USE
A LITTLE DEVELOPMENT,

BUT IT'S A GREAT BEGINNING.

<i>THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD</i>
<i>REMEMBERS THE NIGHT</i>

<i>THAT DAD LEFT.</i>

WE JUST STARTED
GOING BACK TO COUNSELING.
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THIS.

YEAH, WELL, I'M LEAVING.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

THAT'S MINE!
THAT IS NOT YOURS.

I...THANK YOU.

YOU CAN'T COME BACK!

NO!

I HATE YOU!

<i>[SOBBING]</i>
<i>I HATE YOU!</i>

SCREW IT.

IF ANYONE ASKS,
WE'RE JEWISH.

<i>IT'S BEEN ME AND MOM</i>
<i>EVER SINCE.</i>

MOM, WAKE UP.

YOU PASSED OUT AGAIN.

WAKE UP, MOM.
OH, JESUS!

CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU SURVIVED THE NIGHT.

OH, JESUS.
IF YOU WERE DESCENT,
YOU WOULD JUST LET ME SLEEP.

IF I WAS DESCENT,
I'D JUST PUT YOU TO SLEEP.

MY GOD.
MY HEAD.

YOU KNOW, THE MORNING
ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HURT.

I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

WHY DO I HAVE TO GET UP?

HERE.

ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DRINKING

WITH ALL THOSE PILLS
DR. DIEHLER'S GIVING YOU?

DR. WHEELER. WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE THAT TO THE PROFESSIONALS?

CAN I HAVE MY OTHER GLASS
BACK, PLEASE?

IT'S IN THE SINK.
GET IT YOURSELF.

YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE ME WISH I'D
HAD THAT ABORTION IN THE '90s.

THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
GO TO SCHOOL ALREADY!

GO! GO! GO!

AND IF I AM STILL SLEEPING
WHEN YOU GET HOME,

DON'T YOU DARE PUT MY HAND
IN A BOWL OF WATER AGAIN.

[LAUGHS]
SHUT UP.

BYE. LOVE YOU, TOO.

WOULD YOU BRING ME
MY PILLOW BACK?!

CLOSE THE SHADES.

[DOOR CLOSES]
I HATE YOU.

<i>HIGH SCHOOL.</i>

<i>SOCIETY'S BRIGHT IDEA</i>
<i>TO PUT ALL THEIR AGGRESSIVE,</i>

<i>SELF RIGHTEOUS,</i>
<i>PUBESCENT, NAIVE YOUTH</i>
<i>INTO ONE ENVIRONMENT</i>

<i>TO TORMENT</i>
<i>AND EMOTIONALLY SCAR</i>
<i>EACH OTHER FOR LIFE.</i>

CATTLE, CATTLE,
CATTLE, CATTLE!

<i>SHAKESPEARE ONCE WROTE</i>
<i>THAT LIFE IS BUT A DREAM.</i>

<i>AND THAT'S EXACTLY</i>
<i>HOW I LIVED MY LIFE,</i>

<i>FROM ONE DREAM TO THE NEXT.</i>

<i>HATING EVERY</i>
<i>UPDATE OF REALITY.</i>

WELL, THE "I" STANDS FOR
AN IMAGINARY NUMBER.

OKAY, HOLD UP.
THERE ARE IMAGINARY
NUMBERS NOW?

ARE THERE
UNICORNS THE NEXT LESSON?
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE

TEACH ME SOMETHING USEFUL,
LIKE HOW TO BALANCE A CHECKBOOK?

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHY DID I GET A "C" ON THIS?

THIS IS A GREAT PAPER.
THE ASSIGNMENT WAS TO PICK

EITHER EVOLUTION OR CREATIONISM
AND PROVIDE BACKGROUND EVIDENCE

AS TO WHY
YOU BELIEVE THAT THEORY.

I KNOW.
I PICKED EVOLUTION.

I SAID THAT IT'S
OBVIOUS CREATURES CAN ADAPT
TO THEIR ENVIRONMENTS

BECAUSE I NO LONGER
HAVE THE URGE TO THROW THINGS

AT STUDENTS
WHO BELIEVE IN CREATIONISM.

RIGHT?

RIGHT?

I BELIEVE IN CREATIONISM.

EXHIBIT "A."

WELCOME TO CAREER DAY
HERE AT THE COUNSELING CENTER.

RIGHT, I'M SURE
YOU SAW OUR FLIER.

AND YOU KNOW,
WE'RE HERE TO JUST SORT OF
HELP YOU KIDDOS

ESTABLISH YOUR
FUTURE CAREER OPTIONS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO...

I KNOW THE EXACT CAREER
THAT I WANT.

OKAY.
WHAT IS IT, MUNCHKIN?

I WANT TO BE THE EDITOR
OF <i>THE NEW YORKER</i>

AND THE YOUNGEST
FREELANCE JOURNALIST
TO BE PUBLISHED

IN <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES,</i>
<i>LA TIMES, BOSTON HERALD,</i>
<i>AND</i> <i>THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE.</i>

YOU HAVE HAD SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS THEN, HUH?

EVERY DAY SINCE I WAS EIGHT.
OKAY. WELL...

WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE?
I CAN HELP YOU DECIDE
WHAT COLLEGE TO GO TO.

UH, NO. I'VE GOT
TO GET INTO NORTHWESTERN.

ALL RIGHT.
WHERE IS THAT EXACTLY?

ILLINOIS.
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

I'VE PUT 17 GOOD YEARS
INTO THIS TOWN, OKAY?

PEOPLE SPEND LESS TIME
IN PRISON FOR MURDER SENTENCES.

IS THAT TRUE?
YES. YES, LOOK IT UP.

I'VE BEEN THE PRESIDENT
OF THE WRITERS' CLUB

AND THE EDITOR OF THE NEWSPAPER
SINCE SOPHOMORE YEAR

JUST TO BETTER MY CHANCES
OF GETTING INTO THAT SCHOOL.

THAT IS SO SMART.

WOW.
IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING.

SO I'VE ALREADY APPLIED
AND I MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS.

I JUST HAVEN'T
HEARD BACK FROM THEM.

SO I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU UM,

MAYBE FOUND OUT WHY.

OKAY. AND THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DO?
I WOULD CALL THEM?

YES.
OKAY.

I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO GET INTO THAT SCHOOL.

I MEAN ANYTHING.
I'M ON IT.

BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE,
HOW 'BOUT YOU JUST FILL OUT THIS

CLOVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE
APPLICATION.

'CAUSE WITH EVERY APPLICATION,

I GET A POINT
TOWARDS A JUICE CUP.

AHEM. DO YOU JUICE?

BECAUSE IT'S REALLY
CHANGED HOW I FEEL.

LAST WEEK'S EDITION OF
THE <i>CLOVER HIGH CHRONICLE</i>

WAS YET
ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT.

WE DID HAVE NEW MATERIAL
FOR EACH OF THE SECTIONS,

BUT ONCE AGAIN,

IT WAS ALL WRITTEN BY ME.

NOW THIS,
THIS HAS TO STOP.

THIS IS NOT THE
<i>CARSON PHILLIPS CHRONICLE.</i>

ALL RIGHT? IT'S THE
<i>CLOVER HIGH CHRONICLE.</i>

CARSON PHILLIPS.
CLOVER HIGH.

HOPEFULLY,
THIS WEEK WILL BE DIFFERENT.

DWAYNE! DO YOU HAVE
THAT MOVIE REVIEW READY
FOR    <i>MANSLAUGHTER 3 YET?</i>

YES.
YEAH?

NO.
NO.

I WENT,
BUT I PASSED OUT.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
IT WAS GONNA BE IN 3D.

IT WASN'T.
WHOA.

VICKI. DO YOU HAVE
YOUR WEATHER REPORT READY?

WHAT?
YOUR WEATHER REPORT.

YEAH, IT'S CLOUDY.

OKAY. THANK YOU, VICKI.

PROGRESS, RIGHT?

AND UH, EMILIO,

DO YOU HAVE A SECTION
YOU'D LIKE TO TACKLE THIS WEEK?

UH...I LOVE AMERICA.

OKAY. GREAT.

I LOVE THE APHORISM.

WE'LL CREATE
A PATRIOTIC SECTION
JUST FOR YOU.

NOW.

MOVING ONTO CREATIVE WRITING.
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY

SHORT STORIES OR--
YES, I DID WRITE

A SHORT STORY.
FANTASTIC. LET'S HEAR IT.

UM...

THIS IS WRITTEN BY MALERIE.

"IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES.

"IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES.

IT WAS THE AGE OF WISDOM."

MALERIE.
YOU DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

YEAH,
IT'S IN MY HANDWRITING.

BUT UM...

IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME THEN...

[PERIOD BELL RINGS]
PLEASE COME BACK TOMORROW

WITH SOMETHING, WITH ANYTHING.
AND DON'T FORGET THAT THERE'S

A WRITERS' CLUB MEETING
IN CASE ANY OF YOU

CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT WANTING TO JOIN.

OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONALITIES.

<i>THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING</i>
<i>TO DO IN CLOVER...</i>

<i>BESIDES JAMBA JUICE</i>
<i>AND COW TIPPING.</i>

THERE'S NO "H" IN SUCK!

<i>SO TO ENTERTAIN OURSELVES,</i>
<i>WE ALL BECAME</i>

<i>DIEHARD CLUB MEMBERS.</i>

<i>WE HAD THE CHEERLEADERS.</i>

SHE SMELLS LIKE GLUTEN.
[LAUGHTER]

<i>YEARBOOK CLUB LED BY</i>
<i>THE HUMAN MOSQUITO KNOWN AS</i>

<i>REMY BAKER.</i>
<i>- NO!</i>

I DON'T WANT ANY FATTIES ON
THE BACK TO SCHOOL NIGHT PAGE!

I DON'T WANT TO EXPOSE
MY GRANDCHILDREN TO A BUNCH OF

OBESE SOPHOMORES...

BY BODY IS SACRED.

<i>THE CELIBACY CLUB.</i>

IT'S TIME THAT WE'RE TREATED
LIKE THE TREASURES THAT WE ARE.

AND, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT!

<i>THERE WAS THE DRAMA CLUB.</i>

<i>ALWAYS WRITTEN, DIRECTED,</i>
<i>AND PRODUCED BY SCOTT THOMAS.</i>

OKAY. I'VE BEEN
GIVING THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.
MERYL STREEP AS MAMA ROSE.

THOUGHTS? THOUGHTS?
YEAH, IT'S DONE.

HUGS. HUGS.


<i>AND THEN THE ATHLETES.</i>

BOYS,
CAN YOU FREEZE FIRE?

HOT STUFF,
CAN YOU FREEZE FIRE?

YES.

WELL, UM...

HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE
<i>THE LAST AIRBENDER?</i>

NO. I SLEEP WITH GIRLS.

OH. UM,
WELL, YOU KNOW...

IN CERTAIN DIMENSIONS,

YES.

YOU JUST
COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND.

CAN I GET A CLOSE-UP
OF YOUR BICEP?

<i>AND OF COURSE,</i>
<i>WORSE THAN DETENTION,</i>

<i>THE WRITERS' CLUB.</i>

HI, MALERIE.

I WROTE ANOTHER
SHORT STORY FOR THE <i>CHRONICLE.</i>

GREAT.
LET'S HEAR IT.

IT'S UM...

THIS ONE,
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

IT'S PROBABLY MY BEST ONE.


CALL ME ISHMAEL.
SOME YEARS AGO,

NEVER MIND
HOW LONG PRECISELY--

MALERIE.
DID YOU REALLY WRITE THIS?

NO.

YOU SAW RIGHT THROUGH ME.

[SIGHS HEAVILY]

I'M A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT.

DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
I MEAN, WRITING TAKES TIME.

YOUR OWN WORDS WOULD HELP, TOO.

BUT I CAN'T THINK OF
ANY IDEAS MYSELF.

LIKE,
I HAVE NO IMAGINATION.

ALL GOD BLESSED ME WITH
WAS THIS FLAWLESS COMPLEXION

AND REALLY GOOD
TABLE TENNIS SKILLS.

I'M LIKE, ASIAN GOOD.

HOW DO YOU DO IT?

I...

UH, WELL, I DON'T...

DON'T TRY TO FIND THE IDEAS.

LET THE IDEAS FIND YOU.

IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
AMAZING EXPERIENCES.

YOU KNOW, FINDING SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT OR UH...

REALIZING SOMETHING
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

IT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE

AND THEN IT JUST HITS YOU

AND IT'S ALL
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT

AND IT GOES THROUGH YOUR BODY,

AND IT TRIES TO ESCAPE AND, AND

BE EXPRESSED
IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.

I MEAN, IT'S UH...

IT'S A LOT LIKE UM...
LIGHTNING.

YEAH, YEAH.

EXACTLY.

YEAH, EXACTLY.

YEAH.
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT SOON.

<i>[INTERCOM] ATTENTION</i>
<i>STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBERS.</i>

<i>THERE'S A MEETING</i>
<i>IN THE ACTIVITIES OFFICE.</i>

THEY ONLY HAVE THESE MEETINGS
WHEN THEY THINK I'VE GONE HOME.

THE JOKE'S ON THEM.
I NEVER GO HOME.

YEAH, EITHER DO I.

'CAUSE HOME IS OVERRATED.

SO IS M&M's WORLD.

SERIOUSLY.

<i>I OFTEN FANTASIZED</i>
<i>ABOUT VARIOUS TORTURE METHODS</i>

<i>I WOULD RATHER</i>
<i>HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING</i>
<i>THAN SITTING IN A</i>

<i>- STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING.</i>
<i>- AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT</i>

THAT THERE WILL BE
ENOUGH TRAILERS AND TRUCKS
FOR ALL THE CLUBS

TO HAVE FLOATS
AT HOMECOMING.

<i>IT WAS RUN</i>
<i>BY OUR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT</i>

<i>CLAIRE MATHEWS.</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, THAT GIRL.</i>

<i>THE ONE THAT</i>
<i>PROBABLY SHITS CUPCAKES.</i>

AND AS EXCITED AS
WE ALL ARE ABOUT HOMECOMING,

WE NEED TO CHOOSE A THEME
FOR THE SADIE HAWKINS DANCE.

IT'LL BE HERE
SOONER THAN WE THINK.

OKAY, ANY IDEAS?
"FUN UNDER THE SUN."

THAT SCREAMS
"SKIN CANCER" TO ME.

IT WOULD BE FUN.

IT'S AN EXCUSE
TO WEAR FLIP FLOPS
AND BIKINIS TO SCHOOL.

YES.

WHAT ABOUT
"ONE NIGHT IN PARIS"?

MY FAMILY AND I
WENT OVER THE SUMMER
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

AB FAB IDEA.

IF WE GO ALL OUT,
IT MIGHT RUN US OVER BUDGET.

SO NICHOLAS, DO YOU THINK
YOUR DAD COULD COVER IT?

HE'S NEVER
TURNED US DOWN BEFORE.

OKAY,
"ONE NIGHT IN PARIS."
LIKE THE SEX TAPE?

COME ON.
OKAY, FINE.

LET'S GO WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE GENERIC

LIKE "UNDER THE SEA."
IT WAS THE THEME

OF MY PARENTS' SCHOOL DANCE.

WELL, IF YOU'RE
NOT GOING FOR ORIGINALITY.

WE AREN'T.
GREAT.

EVERYONE CAN BRING THEIR CRABS.

I HATE YOU MORE THAN
I HATE THE HOLOCAUST.

BITE ME, HOBBIT.

SORRY. WE DON'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HIM.

HE'S ONLY HERE
BECAUSE HE'S THE EDITOR
OF THE STUPID PAPER.

WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
GO TO ANYTHING ANYWAY.

BECAUSE THEY'RE STUPID!
OKAY, FINE!

THEN YOU CHOOSE A THEME,
CARSON!

OKAY. UM...

YOU ALL LIKE TV, RIGHT?

WHAT ABOUT
FAMOUS TELEVISION COUPLES, HUH?

PEOPLE COULD BE UM,
FRED AND WILMA,

MULDER AND SCULLY,
UH, LUCY AND RICKY.

HEIDI AND SPENCER.
JOHN AND KATE.

SNOOKI AND THE SITUATION.
SERIOUS? NO.

THAT'S REALITY TV...
KHLOE AND LAMAR.

YES! YES!

<i>IF I COULDN'T GET THEM</i>
<i>TO LISTEN TO ME,</i>

<i>WHAT MADE ME THINK</i>
<i>I COULD GET THE WORLD TO?</i>

WELL, UM...
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

<i>POOR MOM.</i>
<i>SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE</i>
<i>TRYING TO BE BETTY CROCKER.</i>

<i>AND BECAME BETTY FORD.</i>

ANTIDEPRESSANTS.
ANTI NAUSEA. ANTIHISTAMINE.

ANTI-ANXIETY.
ACID REFLUX. ESTROGEN.

OSTEOPOROSIS.
TENDONITIS.
WRAP 'EM UP.

HI THERE.

I'LL JUST
POP THESE IN THE COMPUTER
AND YOU CAN BE ON YOUR WAY.

WHO ARE YOU? WHERE'S CHUCK?
CHUCK RETIRED.

I'M APRIL ADAMS.

I TOOK OVER FOR HIM.

I'M NEW IN TOWN.
I'M FROM THE BAY AREA.

I WILL BE HERE
MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY.

I'M SURE YOUR
LIFE IS JUST WONDERFUL,
BUT CLEARLY MINE IS NOT.

SO COULD YOU
HURRY THIS UP FOR ME PLEASE?

HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

SIX MONTHS.

IT'S A BOY.

OOH. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS,

EXCITEMENT, JOY.

ENDLESS CRAVINGS
FOR PICKLES AND PEANUT BUTTER.

I'M SURE
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
ARE JUST THRILLED.

FIANCE.
OH, HOW LIBERAL.

GOOD THING SHOTGUN WEDDINGS
AREN'T PART OF THOSE GUN LAWS

YOU PEOPLE VOTED FOR,
HUH?

I'M DONE HERE,
MRS. PHILLIPS.

MS.
THEY'LL BE READY IN AN HOUR.

FRESH FROM THE OVEN.

THANK YOU.

I BROUGHT YOU
THE LATEST EDITION OF THE
<i>CLOVER HIGH CHRONICLE.</i>

MY ARTICLE IS CALLED
"SMALL TOWN SEX SCANDAL."

DO YOU KNOW MY GRANDSON?


I THINK SO.

I MISS HIM.

HE NEVER COMES
TO VISIT ME ANYMORE.

HE USED TO WRITE ME STORIES.

I REMEMBER
THE FIRST STORY
HE EVER WROTE ME.

"ONCE UPON A TIME
THERE WAS A BOY."

[CHUCKLING]
I REMEMBER.

I TOLD HIM IT COULD USE
A LITTLE DEVELOPMENT.

SO THE NEXT DAY,
HE BROUGHT ME ANOTHER STORY.

"ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A BOY WHO...

WHO WANTED TO FLY."

I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY GRANDSON THOUGH.

HE'S CHANGED OVER THE YEARS.

HE USED TO BE SO HAPPY AND...

NOW HE WALKS AROUND
WITH SO MUCH NEGATIVE ENERGY.

SOMETIMES...

SOMEONE'S PERSONAL RAIN CLOUD

CAN BE DEADLY.

HEY.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

MUNICH.

OH.

SOME PEOPLE
GET TO COME HOME

TO WONDERFUL
FIANCES AND SONOGRAMS.

AND I GET A...

SMART-ASS KID I NEVER
EVEN WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.


I WASN'T WANTED,
HUH?

NEVER HAVE A KID
TO SAVE A MARRIAGE.
IT DOES NOT WORK.


I COULD'VE BEEN A PHARMACIST.

BUT I SETTLED
FOR SETTLING DOWN

BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.

BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE

WANTED.

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE, MOTHER.

OH, IT WAS TOO LATE YEARS AGO.

YOU'RE LUCKY,
CARSON.

YOU'RE YOUNG AND NAIVE AND,

AND ALL THOSE DREAMS YOU HAVE
ABOUT GETTING OUT OF THIS TOWN

AND BECOMING SOMETHING
STILL SEEM REACHABLE.

YOU SHOULD HOLD ONTO THAT
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.


GOODNIGHT, MOTHER.

<i>[APRIL]</i>
<i>HER LAST NAME WAS PHILLIPS.</i>

YOU HAVE ANY
HIDDEN, CRAZY SISTERS
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

UM, NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

I MEAN, MY FATHER
WAS IN THE NAVY, SO...

GOOD.
YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

I'M SURPRISED YOUR AURA
DIDN'T SET OFF THE SMOKE ALARM.

SHE SURE SET YOU OFF.

YEAH.

I'M SORRY.

JUST PEOPLE LIKE THAT
MAKE ME QUESTION THE HUMAN RACE.

IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING

BY BRINGING ANOTHER ONE
INTO THE WORLD.

OH, HEY.

WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

AND THAT LUNATIC
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US,
OUR LIFE, OR OUR CHILD.

OKAY? REMEMBER THAT.

OKAY?

HEY, REMEMBER,
WE HAVE THAT MEETING

WITH THE ATTORNEY TOMORROW.

AND THE NEIGHBOR
ACROSS THE STREET WITH
THE WONDERING EYE

WANTS TO HAVE A BARBECUE.
OH, YEAH.

<i>[ANSWERING MACHINE] HI.</i>
<i>YOU'VE REACHED NEAL PHILLIPS</i>

<i>WITH PR REAL ESTATE.</i>
<i>PLEASE LEAVE A BRIEF MESSAGE</i>

<i>AND I'LL GET</i>
<i>RIGHT BACK TO YOU.</i>

CHILD...SUPPORT...LATE!

IS THAT BRIEF ENOUGH
FOR YOU, ASSHOLE?

WE PRINT TOMORROW

AND NONE OF YOU
HAVE WRITTEN ANYTHING.

OH, BUT I DID COLLATE
THESE KITTEN PICTURES.

OKAY. I MEAN, IS THIS HOW
IT'S GONNA BE ALL YEAR?

I MEAN, DO ANY OF YOU
ACTUALLY WANT TO BE HERE?

I REALLY WANT TO BE HERE.

ALL RIGHT, WELL,

IT LOOKS LIKE
I WILL BE HERE ALL NIGHT

DOING WHAT
YOU ALL SHOULD'VE DONE.

AGAIN.

WOULD YOU CUT
THE SOLILOQUY SHORT?

THIS DOESN'T MATTER.

NO ONE READS
THE    <i>CHRONIC</i>ANYWAY.

HEY, THE ART CLASS USES IT
TO PAPIER-MACHE THINGS.

[PERIOD BELL RINGS]

CARSON.

WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

JUST DON'T, OKAY?

UH, YOU'RE AN ANIMAL.

NO, YOU ARE.

[SCOTT] MM-HMM.
[NICHOLAS] NO, YOU ARE.

OKAY, I AM.

MM-HMM, I TOLD YOU.

[CARSON] AHEM!
[SCOTT] GET OFF ME!

[TOILET FLUSHES]

WELL, GENTLEMEN.

I...AM...SHOCKED.

AMUSED.
BUT SHOCKED.

GO AHEAD.
TELL THE WHOLE WORLD.
WE DON'T CARE.

GOD, SCOTT.
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
MY PARENTS CAN'T FIND OUT.

LISTEN, CAGNEY, LACEY.

I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE AN OUTCAST.

I BET.

I WOULDN'T WISH THE STRUGGLES
OF AN OUTED OUTCAST TO ANYONE.

SO I WON'T TELL.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
FANTASTIC.

BUT...

SINCE I WILL BE KEEPING
MY MOUTH SHUT ABOUT YOUR

YOU KNOW, INABILITIES,
YOU KNOW, NOT TO,

PERHAPS YOU COULD
RETURN A FAVOR.

HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?
OH, NO.

HAVE SOME
SELF RESPECT. NO!

I DON'T WANT YOU TO
SHIT A DIME FOR ME, NICHOLAS.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
<i>THE CLOVER HIGH CHRONICLE</i>
<i>COULD USE?</i>

A FINANCE SECTION.
[SCOFFS]

AND A WEEKLY UPDATE FROM
THE PERFORMING ARTS DEPARTMENT.

YOU WANT US TO WRITE FOR
YOU HID-E-ODOUS SCHOOL PAPER?

FOR HOW LONG?
NO.

UNTIL WE GRADUATE
AND GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

THAT'S IT. NO.
I'D RATHER YOU JUST LET
THE WHOLE SCHOOL KNOW.

SHUT UP, SCOTT.
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

JUST BECAUSE HE'S HERE,
YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?

WE'LL DO IT.
GENTLEMEN,

SHARPEN YOUR PENCILS.

<i>[BOB]</i>
<i>I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU BOTH</i>

FOR COMING TODAY.

UM, THERE'S NO
DELICATE WAY TO PUT THIS,

SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT.

NEAL, YOU CANNOT MARRY APRIL

BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL MARRIED.

[NERVOUS LAUGHTER]

HOW COME
I'M THE ONLY ONE
LAUGHING HERE?

UM, HOW?

YOUR WIFE NEVER SIGNED
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

THIS IS A REALLY
LONG JOKE, YOU GUYS.

WELL, UM, APRIL.

UM...

THIS IS A JOKE,
RIGHT?

'CAUSE YOU WOULD'VE
TOLD ME IF YOU HAD AN EX-WIFE

OR SO MUCH AS
A COCKER SPANIEL

BEFORE WE HAD--
JUST-- JUST A SON.

HIS NAME
IS CARSON PHILLIPS.
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.

A SON?

OKAY, I'VE GOTTA GO.

APRIL--

DON'T YOU DARE
SAY ANYTHING TO ME.

BOB.

[PERIOD BELL RINGS]

CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHICH
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION

WAS REFERRED TO AS CAMELOT?
CLINTON?

NO.
THAT WAS CAME-A-LOT.
HEH, HEH, HEH, HEH.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

<i>HEY, SHERYL. IT'S NEAL.</i>
<i>LISTEN, WE NEED TO TALK.</i>
<i>IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.</i>

SO I'M GONNA
COME OVER THERE THIS AFTERNOON

<i>AND I'M</i>
<i>NOT LEAVING UNTIL WE DO.</i>
<i>SEE YOU SOON.</i>

<i>THANKS.</i>

<i>THANKS.</i>

YOU HEARD BACK FROM

NORTHWESTERN?
OH, MY GOD!

YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

IT'S A JUICE CUP.

UM, YES, I DID.

THAT IS A FANCY SCHMANCY SCHOOL
YOU'RE LOOKING AT UP THERE.

AND?
WELL, I DIDN'T FIND OUT

IF YOU'D BEEN
ACCEPTED OR DENIED,

BUT THE PERSON I TALKED TO
SAID THAT HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS

AND CLUBS JUST
AREN'T CUTTING IT ANYMORE.

SO, IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS THEM,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SUBMIT

SOMETHING ELSE.
LIKE WHAT?

UM...
YOU KNOW WHAT?

I ACTUALLY WROTE THIS DOWN.
SOMEWHERE I MADE A LIST.

HERE WE GO.

YOU COULD SUBMIT A NOVEL,
A BOOK OF POEMS...

I CAN'T READ
MY HANDWRITING DOWN THERE.

I'M NOT A NOVELIST
AND I'M NOT A POET.
I'M A JOURNALIST.

I KNOW.
YOU'RE A JOURNALIST.

UM, WHAT ABOUT
A LITERARY MAGAZINE?

A LITERARY MAGAZINE?
IT'S NOT AS COMMON

AS A HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPER,
AND YOU KNOW, A MAGAZINE

FILLED WITH YOUR WORK
AND THE WORK OF OTHER STUDENTS,

WELL, I THINK IT
WOULD SHOW THEM THAT YOU CAN
INSPIRE OTHERS TO WRITE

WHILE WRITING YOURSELF.

OKAY, I'LL DO IT. HOW?

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO
A LITERARY MAGAZINE.

BUT GET PERMISSION
FROM THE PRINCIPAL FIRST,

BECAUSE HE CAN BE
SUCH AN ASSHOLE. UM...

OKAY. ALL RIGHT. UM...

THANK YOU.

[DOORBELL RINGS]


OKAY.

HI, SHERYL.

NEAL.
YEAH.

YOUR SCREEN'S STILL BROKEN.

CAN I COME IN?
UH, WELL, JUST FOR A MINUTE

'CAUSE I'M
EXPECTING COMPANY SO...

YEAH. OKAY, SURE.

HEY.
HEY.

HEY.

OH. IT'S PINK NOW.

YEAH.

HMM.

CAN I GET YOU A BEER?

UM, LET'S SEE.

WELL, NO.
NO, I THINK I'M GOOD.

THANKS.

HI. YOU LOOK...

YOU LOOK GOOD, SHERYL.
OH.

NO, COME ON.
OH, THANKS.

I'D SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU
BUT THEN WE'D BOTH BE LIARS.

YEAH.
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE SCREAMING

PROFANITIES AT ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

SO THIS IS A STEP UP.
I THINK YOU ARE EXAGGERATING

JUST A LITTLE BIT.
NO, NO.

YEAH.
BUT I DESERVED IT.

SO WHY ARE YOU HERE,
NEAL?

DID YOU COME TO GLOAT ABOUT
YOUR NEW HAPPY LIFE?

UH, NO.
I'M HERE BECAUSE UM...


YOU NEVER SIGNED
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

OH, JEEZ.
I THOUGHT I MAILED
THOSE BACK IN.

YEAH, NO.
OH, MAYBE I UH,

RIPPED THEM UP
INTO LITTLE PIECES

AND THREW 'EM
INTO THE FIREPLACE.

I FORGET.

I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU!

I KNOW YOU CAN SEE ME!

I'M TIRED.

WHAT DO YOU NEED,
MR. PHILLIPS?

I ALREADY TOLD YOU I CAN'T FORCE
THE ENGLISH TEACHERS TO PASS OUT

THE <i>CHRONICLE</i> OR ANY
OTHER BIASED PUBLICATION.

I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
HAVE NO INQUIRIES OR REQUESTS
ABOUT THE <i>CHRONICLE.</i>

UH, GOD!

I...

I WANT TO START
A SCHOOL LITERARY MAGAZINE.


WHY-WHY--
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

OKAY, FINE.

YOU CAN START YOUR
LITERARY MAGAZINE OR YOU KNOW,

YOU CAN START
A HUNTING MAGAZINE
FOR ALL I CARE,

BUT...

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
YOUR OWN FUNDING BECAUSE...

THE SCHOOL IS BROKE.

I'D ALSO LIKE TO ANNOUNCE IT
AT THE ASSEMBLY THIS WEEK.

[LAUGHS]
IT'LL TAKE THREE SECONDS.

FINE. IF FOR NOTHING ELSE
THAN MY OWN AMUSEMENT.

GREAT. GREAT.
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.

HEY! BREAK IT UP!
NOT ON MY CAMPUS!

THERE'S A MOTEL 6
DOWN THE STREET!


I GOT YA! I GOT YA! I GOT YA!

YEP, THAT'S IT.

YEP, IT'S JUST PAPERS.

SIGNATURE
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

[EXHALES HEAVILY]

OKAY. YEAH,
THANKS, SHERYL.

FOR WHAT'S IT'S WORTH,
I'M SORRY.

I'M SORRY I'M NOT THE MAN
YOU WANTED ME TO BE.

YEAH. ME, TOO.
YEAH. ME, TOO.

OKAY.

OH, PLEASE.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

OKAY. I'LL SEE YA.

OKAY. I'LL SEE YA.

<i>[SHERYL]</i>
<i>THERE'S SO MUCH STRESS</i>
<i>IN MY LIFE.</i>

IT'S A MIRACLE
I'M ABLE TO FUNCTION
AS WELL AS I DO.

BUT DOES ANYBODY CARE?

DOES ANYBODY...

DOES MY SON
SEE HOW MUCH I STRUGGLE
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

WELL, I DON'T ENVY YOU.
THANK YOU, DR. WHEELER.

YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO UNDERSTANDS MY SITUATION.

HE'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE
LIKE HIS FATHER EVERY DAY.

HE'S RUDE, SARCASTIC.

HE MAKES
A JOKE AT MY EXPENSE
WHENEVER HE CAN.

AND ALL HE TALKS ABOUT
IS LEAVING FOR COLLEGE ONE DAY.

EVERYBODY ABANDONS ME
OR PLANS TO ABANDON ME.
IF I HAD A GOLDFISH...

HE WOULD PROBABLY
ABANDON YOU AS WELL.

IT WOULD ABANDON ME.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A GOLDFISH.

NO, I DON'T,
THANK GOD.

WELL, THE THING
ABOUT GOLDFISH IS

THEY'RE IN THAT BOWL,
THEY CAN'T GET OUT.

IT WOULD FIND A WAY.
[LAUGHING]

THAT'S PRETTY
EXTREME THINKING.

UM, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
YES.

IS HE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS?
NO.

DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS THEM?
DO I THINK HE NEEDS THEM?

WELL, IN ALL HONESTY,

I THINK ALL TEENAGERS
NEED THEM

WHETHER THEY'RE
DEPRESSED OR NOT.

YOU KNOW, TEENAGERS
ARE SO FULL OF HORMONES.

THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL THEY WANT.

ALL THEY'RE THINKING
ABOUT IS RUBBING AGAINST
A PILLOW OR A CUSHION

OR ANOTHER TEENAGER.
YOU KNOW, SO.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW YOU'RE
MAKING ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

AND I THINK IF HE HAD
SOMETHING TO GROUND HIM,

UH, HE WOULDN'T BE
SO EAGER TO FLY AWAY.

YOU NEED TO BE
ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

NO WAY.

YOU'RE MEDICATED ENOUGH
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

AREN'T YOU DEPRESSED?

CURRENTLY, WHILE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION? YEAH.

EVERYONE GETS DEPRESSED.

IT'S AN EMOTION.
PEOPLE TURN TO PILLS.

BEFORE THEY TURN
TO THEIR PROBLEMS THESE DAYS.

WELL, SOMETIMES
IT'S THE ONLY SOLUTION.

YOU'RE DEPRESSING ME RIGHT NOW.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT

I'M GONNA TAKE A PILL
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA DISAPPEAR?

THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR.

AND SO ARE
MOST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

WE ARE LIVING IN
A MEDICATED SOCIETY.

WE START
DRUGGING KIDS WITH A.D.D.,
WHICH THEY ALL HAVE,

AND THEN IT
DOESN'T STOP TILL DEATH.

YOU WERE ON
ADD MEDICATION AS A KID,
AND YOU TURNED OUT

SOMEWHAT DECENT.

NO, I WASN'T.

I HID IT IN YOUR FOOD.

I THOUGHT I WAS
JUST REALLY CALM AND
MATURE FOR MY AGE.

NOPE, YOU WERE DRUGGED.

WHEN YOUR FATHER AND I
STARTED OUR DIVORCE,

YOU STARTED
ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS,
WE FOUND IT EASIER

TO ROOFIE YOU THAN ANSWER YOU.

WELL, IT ISN'T DINNER
UNLESS SOME FORM OF

MY CHILDHOOD FOUNDATION
IS SHATTERED.


I NEED MONEY.
I GIVE YOU AN ALLOWANCE.

I NEED MORE MONEY.
$300.

I WANT TO START
A LITERARY MAGAZINE AT SCHOOL,

AND I NEED MONEY TO PRINT
THE FIRST 100 COPIES OR SO.

NO.

WHY NOT?
I KNOW YOU'RE ROLLING IN IT.

GRANDPA DIED
AND LEFT US EVERYTHING.

WRONG.
HE LEFT ME EVERYTHING.
YOU, HIS CAR.

WHAT ABOUT MY COLLEGE FUND?
KEY WORD, COLLEGE.

OKAY. IF I START
TAKING ANTIDEPRESSANTS,

WILL YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY
TO START MY LITERARY MAGAZINE?

DEAL.

PASS ME THE SALT.

HELLO,
FUTURE FARMERS AND INMATES.

I'M CARSON PHILLIPS FROM
<i>THE CLOVER HIGH CHRONICLE</i>

HERE WITH SOME
VERY EXCITING NEWS.

THIS YEAR,
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

CLOVER HIGH
WILL RELEASE ITS FIRST
LITERARY MAGAZINE.

WHOO! AWESOME!

[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

NOW, I KNOW MOST OF YOU
CAN'T READ LET ALONE WRITE,

BUT FOR ALL
THE SECRET WRITERS OUT THERE,

PLEASE SUBMIT
ANY ORIGINAL WORK

TO THE BOX OUTSIDE
THE JOURNALISM CLASSROOM
AND IT WILL BE PUBLISHED.

<i>POEMS.</i>
<i>SHORT STORIES.</i>

<i>HIT LISTS.</i>

ANYTHING.

OKAY. THANK YOU.

GOD BLESS.

WHOO!
CARSON!

OKAY, ASSEMBLY DISMISSED.
RETURN TO YOUR HOMEROOMS.

AND HEY!
SAY HELLO TO SOMEONE
YOU DON'T KNOW TODAY.

I AM SO EXCITED
FOR HOMECOMING TONIGHT.

OUR FLOAT
IS GONNA BE FLAWLESS.

THE CROWD IS GONNA LOVE IT.

WHOO!

[SIGHS]
OH...NO.

SHITERARY MAGAZINE.

GOD.

TYPICAL. I MEAN,

I CAN'T EVEN RUN
A SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.
I DON'T KNOW WHY

I THOUGHT I COULD START
A LITERARY MAGAZINE.


OH...
PERSONAL SPACE, MALERIE.

OKAY.

JUST DON'T BE
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

IF YOU CAN GET
NICHOLAS FORBES

AND SCOTT THOMAS
TO JOIN THE <i>CHRONICLE,</i>

THEN I THINK
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

I'M BLACKMAILING THEM.

I CAUGHT THEM
PLAYING LEWIS AND CLARK
IN THE BOY'S BATHROOM.

DON'T ASK.
THERE SEEMS TO BE

A LOT OF THAT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

I CAUGHT CLAIRE MATHEWS

AND COACH COLIN
BONKING...

EACH OTHER...

IN THE BOY'S LOCKER ROOM.

I JUST GO IN THERE
TO THINK SOMETIMES.

COACH COLIN WALKER?

I THOUGHT SHE WAS
DATING JUSTIN WALKER.

OH, THAT MUST BE AWKWARD.

TOO BAD THEY AREN'T WRITERS.

IF THEY HAD WORK
IN THE MAGAZINE,

THEN EVERYBODY
WOULD WANT TO HAVE WORK
IN THE LITERARY MAGAZINE.

IT WOULD SELL OUT FOR SURE.

YOU KNOW, IT JUST
MAKES YOU THINK THOUGH.

EVERYBODY
HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE...

EVEN CLAIRE MATHEWS.

HA!

YEAH.

YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

I TRAVEL LIGHTLY TODAY.

NOT A PROBLEM,
MRS. PHILLIPS.

MS. MS. MS.

WHAT?

WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME

LIKE I JUST TOLD YOU
I USED TO BE A MAN?

THIS IS FOR CARSON PHILLIPS?

YEAH,
THAT'S MY SON.

WHY DOES HE NEED
ANTIDEPRESSANTS?

I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS, APRIL.

FORGIVE ME, MISS PHILLIPS--
YOU KNOW WHAT, CALL ME SHERYL.

JUST SIMPLE SHERYL.

I THINK I MAY BE
ENGAGED TO YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

NEAL PHILLIPS?

WAIT! MISS PHILLIPS?

SHERYL?!

[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

HI.

HI.

HOW WAS WORK?

NOT GOOD.

I'M SORRY,
BUT THERE'S ONLY
SO MANY TIMES

I CAN SAY I'M SORRY.
BUT I WANT YOU TO REALIZE

THAT ALL OF THAT WAS A REALLY

DARK PERIOD FOR ME.

UM, SO...

CAN YOU REALLY BLAME ME
FOR NOT WANTING TO

CARRY IT WITH ME?

CAN YOU BLAME ME
FOR WANTING TO FORGET ABOUT IT?

I WANT TO MEET HIM.
YOUR SON, I WANT TO MEET HIM.

YEAH.

WE TRIED
SELLING SOME AD SPACE
TO LOCAL BUSINESSES

BUT I HAD NO TAKERS.

WELL,
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

WHY COULDN'T I HAVE
WORN SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

OKAY. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING,

BUT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
THE TRUCK PULLING

THE CHEER FLOAT'S
ENGINE JUST DIED,

SO THEY'RE TAKING YOURS.
EXCUSE ME?

OH, UM, MY APOLOGIES.

BUT YOU KNOW,
HOMECOMING'S NOTHING

WITHOUT THE CHEER FLOAT.

OKAY, THEN GO TAKE
THE ATHLETES FLOAT AWAY.

I MEAN, THEY PRIDE
THEMSELVES RUNNING AROUND
LIKE MULES ANYWAY.

MY DECISION'S FINAL.

OKAY.

FINAL.

WELL, AT LEAST
WE HAD FUN MAKING IT.

NO. THEY'RE GONNA
SEE THIS FLOAT IF IT KILLS ME.

NICE COSTUME.

NICE LIFE.

[MARCHING BAND PLAYING]

[MARCHING BAND PLAYING]

YEAH!

YEAH!

WHOO!

[BAND PLAYING
"PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC
WHITE BOY"]

[BAND PLAYING
"PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC
WHITE BOY"]

YEAH!

YOU'RE THE MAN!
SCREW YOU!

ARE YOU DRUNK?
WASTED.

â™ª NO MATTER WHAT...

<i>[CLAIRE]</i>
<i>MY APOLOGIES, BUT, YOU KNOW,</i>

<i>HOMECOMING'S NOTHING</i>
<i>WITHOUT THE CHEER FLOAT.</i>

<i>[MALERIE] NO ONE READS</i>
<i>THE "CHRONICLE" ANYWAY.</i>

<i>[GIRL] HE'S ONLY HERE</i>
<i>BECAUSE HE'S THE EDITOR</i>
<i>OF THAT STUPID PAPER.</i>

â™ª NO MATTER WHAT...

<i>- [TELEPHONE RINGS]</i>
<i>- HELLO?</i>

MALERIE? IT'S CARSON.

<i>WHO?</i>
<i>- CARSON PHILLIPS.</i>

<i>OH, YEAH, I KNEW.</i>

OPERATION CLOVERGATE'S
IN EFFECT.

SO MANY PEOPLE TO BLACKMAIL,
SO LITTLE TIME.

BUT HOW'RE
WE GONNA BLACKMAIL
ALL OF THEM?

HUMPH.

I DON'T KNOW.

I GOT DIRT ON MOST OF THEM.

SO I'M NOT SURE.
BUT THEN AGAIN,

COLUMBUS WASN'T SURE
IF NORTH AMERICA WAS THERE.
BUT IT DIDN'T STOP HIM

FROM SAILING TO IT.
AND ONCE HE WAS THERE,

YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?
WHAT?

HE ENSLAVED
EVERY SINGLE INDIAN
AROUND HIM.

OH, YOU LITTLE INDIANS,
LOOK OUT.

YEAH.

SOME WILL BE
MUCH EASIER THAN OTHERS.

N-N-NO.

â™ª

â™ª WHEN THE SKY

â™ª OPENS

â™ª AND THE SOUND
COMES OUT OF IT NOW â™ª

â™ª IT'S LIKE A BREATH OF AIR
IT'S LIKE A SPLASH OF WATER â™ª

â™ª IT'S LIKE A SLAP

â™ª ON THE HAND...

YOU'RE "BADBOY2012"?

I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU ANYMORE.

NOT THAT IT WAS EASY BEFORE.

IT'S A NICE DAY.

HEY, SIEGFRIED.
HERE YOU GO.

HEY, ROY, ENJOY.

AHEM!

WHAT'S THIS?
[LAUGHING]

COME ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

YOU LEFT IT IN
THE JOURNALISM CLASSROOM.

UM, DID YOU GUYS WANT SOME?

IF WE WERE RESPONSIBLE STUDENTS
WE WOULD GO RIGHT NOW

TO THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES.

LISTEN,
I'LL WRITE THE MOVIE REVIEW,

I PROMISE YOU. HUH?

IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

WHAT A RUSH.

â™ª NO MATTER WHAT

â™ª I SAY

CAN I HELP YOU?

I WAS UH, JUST GOOGLING
SOME SATAN WORSHIPING CULTS,

YOU KNOW,
A HOBBY OF MINE, AND

I CAME ACROSS THESE.
CHECK THESE OUT, RIGHT?

ISN'T THAT YOU, I BELIEVE,
WITH A WHIP IN YOUR MOUTH?

YES, YES, HERE YOU'RE
RIDING SOME GUYS IN THIS ONE.

YES, THAT'S GREAT.
AND THIS ONE.
THIS ONE'S MY FAVORITE.

WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THESE?

OH, I JUST WANT
TO PROTECT YOU, VICKI.

I MEAN, I'D HATE IT
IF THESE WERE ACCIDENTALLY
EMAILED TO YOUR MOM.

DOES SHE STILL TEACH
SUNDAY SCHOOL

AT RYDER BAPTIST CHURCH?

AND WHEN I SAY TEAMWORK,

WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO MIND?

SHUT UP!

MOVE YOUR BOOKS.
MOVE YOUR BOOKS!

â™ª TWO, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT

â™ª HEARD YOU LIKE TO FORNICATE

CARSON!

I WANT YOU TO BE THERE

AT THAT TIME.

I ALSO WANT TO RECOMMEND
NOT SLEEPING WITH STUDENTS...

STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.

STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.

I COULD GET FIRED FOR THIS,
AND I NEED THAT DENTAL PLAN.

IT'S NORMAL
TO BE WITH OLDER WOMEN
IN YOUR CULTURE, RIGHT?

I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING,
BUT YOU ARE SO HOT.

AND YOUNG AND TANNISH
AND IMPORTED.

OH, GOD.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
<i>EAT, PRAY, LOVE.</i>

WAS THAT DIRTY TALK?
   <i>SI.</i>

OH, I LOVE DIRTY TALK.

OH,
YOU'RE SO "SPANELICIOUS!"
I LOVE IT!

<i>[MAN]</i>
<i>MS. HASTINGS?</i>

COMING.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

<i>HOLA?</i>
<i>- WHAT'S UP, MAN?</i>

[REGULAR VOICE]
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRO?

NAH, NOTHING.
I WAS JUST FEELING UP
THE RECEPTIONIST.

<i>YEAH, DUDE, NO,</i>
<i>THE RECEPTIONIST.</i>

<i>IT'S INSANE.</i>
<i>I'M ONE AWAY FROM</i>
<i>BEATING MY RECORD.</i>

I LITERALLY PUT THE "DICK"
IN VALEDICTORIAN.

IT'S...

I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

SO, EMILIO...

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A FORNICATING EXCHANGE STUDENT?

AND I WOULD
TONE DOWN THE <i>TELEMUNDO.</i>

MALERIE HERE IS IN SPANISH 4.
   <i>SI.</i>

I'M ALSO FLUENT IN
CELTIC AND ELVISH.

TAKE THAT LIGHT
IN YOUR FACE.

ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

I'M NOT FROM
EL SALVADOR OBVIOUSLY.

I'M FROM SAN DIEGO.

[SNICKERS]
SEA WORLD, I KNEW IT.

I KNEW HE SMELT
VERY FAINTLY OF DOLPHIN.

NO, I DON'T.
WHAT ELSE? TELL US THE TRUTH!

SPEAK.

THE ONLY SPANISH I KNOW
IS FROM LEVEL ONE,

<i>ROSETTA STONE,</i>
<i>WHICH I STOLE.</i>

I'VE BEEN SAYING
THE SAME 10 PHRASES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

AND NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE.

PLEASE DON'T
TELL MY HOST FAMILY.

DUDE, THEY'D HAVE ME ARRESTED.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

ARE YOU KIDDING?

I GET FOOD, HOUSING...

AND GIRLS.

DUDE, GIRLS LIKE NOTHING MORE
THAN A GUY THAT SPEAKS SPANISH.

THAT JUST LITTLE--
[ROLLS TONGUE]--
OH, MY GOD.

IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

[ROLLS TONGUE]
CONTINUE.

DUDE, YOU CAN'T BLAME ME.

YEAH, YEAH, I CAN.

I CAN BLAME YOU
MUCHAS GRACIAS, SENORITA.

THIS IS FOR YOU.

<i>- SI, "SE PAEDOPHILE."</i>
<i>- AND JUST REMEMBER,</i>

WE HAVE THIS ALL ON FILM.

WELL, HELLO, EVERYONE.

AND WELCOME
TO THE JOURNALISM CLASSROOM.

YOU FASCIST.
OKAY, ENOUGH WITH THE NAMES,

ALL RIGHT? OKAY, LOOK.
I'LL MAKE THIS SHORT AND SWEET.

YOU'RE ALL HERE
BECAUSE I'VE GOT DIRT ON YOU.

OKAY, WELL,
I KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

PRETTY SURE
I KNOW WHY DWAYNE'S HERE.

WHY ARE
THE REST OF YOU HERE?

THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND THE REST OF YOU

TO NEVER KNOW
IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED.

THIS IS BULLSHIT.
NOT TO MENTION ILLEGAL.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY

LAWYERS MY FAMILY HAS?

SEVEN.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

IF ANY OF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

THE INFORMATION I HAVE ON YOU,
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO

AND THEN LEAVE THE ROOM.

DIDN'T THINK SO.

I'M LATE FOR
<i>HELLO DOLLY REHEARSAL</i>

SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?
AS YOU ALL KNOW,

I AM STARTING
A SCHOOL LITERARY MAGAZINE.

YOU WANT US
TO BUY YOUR MAGAZINE?

YOU CLAIRE, NO.
I WOULD NEVER EXPECT YOU

TO RECOGNIZE
AN INTELLIGENT PUBLICATION
LET ALONE PURCHASE ONE.

BUT YOUR FRIENDS
AND FAMILIES, YES. WHY?

'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL
GONNA BE IN IT.

I WANT A LITERARY SUBMISSION
FROM EACH OF YOU.

SO THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

I'M NOT EVEN A STUDENT HERE.

IT'S BECAUSE
I WANT MORE FROM YOU.

AND FROM YOU.

I WANT A SUBMISSION FROM EACH
FOOTBALL PLAYER AND CHEERLEADER.

WHAT?
OH, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME,
MY CHEER TEAM, OR ANYONE ELSE

DO ANYTHING, OKAY?
SEE, THERE IS A REASON

WHY YOU AND PRECIOUS
IN THE CORNER OVER THERE

ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS
OF YOUR CLUB. OKAY?

AND IT'S BECAUSE
EVERYBODY HATES YOU.
EVEN IF YOU SPREAD

WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU
HAVE ON US AROUND THE SCHOOL,

NO ONE IS GOING
TO BELIEVE YOU, GOT IT?

I WILL TOTALLY BELIEVE HIM.
YOU DON'T COUNT.

OH, WE DON'T COUNT?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THEY WILL BELIEVE,
'CAUSE WE WILL SPREAD
THAT SHIT LIKE NUTELLA.

ALL RIGHT, FOR YEARS

I HAVE BEEN POKED AND STABBED
WITH YOUR BITCH FORK.

YOU HAVE BEATEN ME DOWN

TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL FOOD CHAIN

WITH THE SHITTY END OF THE STICK
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE ME?

I WILL
MAKE THEM BELIEVE ME!
YOU DON'T THINK

THEY'VE JUST BEEN
WAITING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO TURN AGAINST YOU?

I MEAN,
SURE THEY ALL HATE ME,
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN TOWN WITH
AN IQ LARGER THAN MY SHOE SIZE

AND I DON'T HESITATE
TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT!

SO GO AHEAD AND PLAY
ALL THE MIND GAMES YOU WANT.
I'M NOT ACCEPTING THAT

INVITATION TO INTIMIDATION
ANY LONGER, ALL RIGHT?!

I'VE GOT A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT
TO GAIN AND NOTHING TO LOSE

AND THIS TIME
NONE OF YOU ARE STOPPING ME!

DO YOU NEED SOME EXAMPLES?!

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES,
ALL RIGHT,

POETRY, SHORT STORIES, ESSAYS,
SCRIPTS, NOVELS, ANYTHING!

AS LONG AS IT'S IN YOUR WORDS,
IN MY HANDS ASAP! YOU GOT IT?!

WRITE ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU HATE ME.

WRITE IN DETAIL ABOUT HOW MUCH
YOU WANT TO KILL ME, OKAY?!

NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF
MY CLASSROOM!

EXCUSE ME.

[LABORED BREATHING]

I'M WORRIED MOST OF YOU

HAVE TAKEN
ONE TOO MANY TACKLES
TO THE HEAD.

WE CAN'T BEAT A TEAM
UNLESS WE OUTTHINK A TEAM.

SO...

TO PROVE YOU ARE
ALL CAPABLE OF DOING THAT,

I WANT YOU ALL
TO SUBMIT SOMETHING

TO THE SCHOOL
LITERARY MAGAZINE.

[GROANING]
UH, WHAT THE--

DON'T QUESTION ME,
HIT THE SHOWERS NOW!

[BLOWS WHISTLE]

<i>[MALE STUDENT]</i>
<i>I LIKE THE COLOR GREEN.</i>

<i>WHEN I SEE GREEN,</i>
<i>I THINK OF TREES, PLANTS</i>

<i>AND GRASS.</i>

<i>WHEN I THINK OF GRASS,</i>
<i>I THINK OF FOOTBALL...</i>

<i>- BRILLIANT.</i>
<i>- [CLAIRE] WE CAN'T CHEER</i>

IF WE'RE NOT CULTURED.

I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO WRITE SOMETHING

FOR THE LITERARY MAGAZINE,
OKAY?


NOW LET'S GO DO
A FRICKIN' PYRAMID.

<i>[CLAIRE'S VOICE]</i>
<i>I LOVE CHEERLEADING.</i>

BUT THE WORST THING ABOUT
BEING ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID IS

<i>YOU CAN GET REALLY HURT</i>
<i>IF YOU FALL.</i>

<i>[VICKI'S VOICE]</i>
<i>IT WAS A WORLD OF</i>
<i>VAMPIRES AND DEMONS</i>

<i>WHERE INNOCENCE WAS RARE</i>

<i>AND SO WERE THE LIVING.</i>

<i>[DWAYNE'S VOICE]</i>
<i>WHY DO PEOPLE LIVE</i>
<i>2D LIVES IN A 3D WORLD</i>

<i>WHEN THEY CAN LIVE</i>
<i>4D LIVES ALL THE TIME?</i>

YEAH.

<i>[SCOTT'S VOICE]</i>
<i>I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT</i>
<i>I WAS DESTINED FOR FAME.</i>

<i>THE IMAGE</i>
<i>OF MY NAME IN LIGHTS</i>
<i>ISN'T JUST A DREAM,</i>

<i>IT'S A PREMONITION.</i>

<i>[NICHOLAS' VOICE]</i>
<i>ROSES ARE RED,</i>

<i>VIOLETS ARE BLUE,</i>

<i>NO AMOUNT OF MONEY</i>
<i>COULD KEEP ME AWAY FROM YOU.</i>

<i>[REMY'S VOICE] THERE WAS</i>
<i>ONCE A LITTLE PRINCESS</i>

<i>WITH SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITIES.</i>

<i>HER PARENTS,</i>
<i>THE KING AND QUEEN,</i>

<i>PUT WAY TOO MUCH</i>
<i>PRESSURE ON HER</i>

<i>SINCE THEY HAD TROUBLES</i>
<i>MANAGING THE KINGDOM.</i>

<i>MALERIE WRITING</i>

<i>PART 38.</i>

<i>ACTION.</i>

<i>CALL ME...</i>

ISABELLA.

IT'S GENIUS.

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>IT WAS ANYTHING LIKE</i>
<i>I'D EVER EXPERIENCED.</i>

<i>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,</i>

<i>I WAS WINNING.</i>

<i>FOR THE FIRST TIME,</i>
<i>EVERYTHING SEEMED REACHABLE.</i>

IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

SO I'M BLACKMAILING
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

TO BETTER MY CHANCES
OF GETTING INTO THE UNIVERSITY

OF MY DREAMS,
AND IT'S EXHILARATING.

I MEAN,
WHO'D OF THOUGHT THAT ONE OF

MY BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
WOULD BE CRIMINAL?

GET OUT.
OH, NO,

NOT TODAY, GRANDMA.
PLEASE DON'T.

NOT TODAY.
GET OUT.

GET OUT.
I DO NOT KNOW YOU!

ALL RIGHT,
OKAY, I'M LEAVING.

<i>[CLAIRE]</i>
<i>SO WE STILL NEED A VENUE</i>
<i>FOR PROM, ANY IDEAS?</i>

I WAS THINKING
QUAIL GARDENS.

WHAT ABOUT
MOTEL 6 UP THE HIGHWAY?

I MEAN, EVERYONE HEADS UP THERE
AFTER PROM ANYWAY, RIGHT?

ANY OBJECTIONS
TO QUAIL GARDENS?

NO OBJECTIONS.

ISN'T QUAIL GARDENS

LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE COUNTRY?

AND PROM IS USUALLY
IN THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER

SO EVERYONE'S GONNA BE
EATEN ALIVE BY BUGS.

I THINK THE UH,
THE CLOVER DINING HALL
WOULD BE CHEAPER

AND SMARTER.
OKAY,

CLOVER DINING HALL IT IS.

AWESOME, MOVING ON.
WE NEED A THEME.

HOW 'BOUT
A FAIRY TALE THEME?
WE COULD DO

AN EASY
CINDERELLA SETTING
FOR PHOTOS.

OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE RAPUNZEL.

YEAH, I'M NOT SURE
ALL THE STUDENTS

WOULD APPRECIATE
UM, THAT THEME.

LIKE THE MALE ONES.

WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DO
LIKE A, UH, ERA THEME,

LIKE THE ROARING '20s
OR SOMETHING?

'20s IS FINE.

SUPER.

OKAY.
WHY ARE YOU GUYS, UH,

LETTING ME MAKE
ALL THE DECISIONS?

IT WAS A LOT MORE FUN
WHEN I GOT TO ARGUE WITH YOU.

ARE YOU GONNA MAKE US
WRITE MORE IF WE DO?

ANYTHING FOR ME?
NO,

JUST BILLS AND ADS

AND BILLS, BILLS, BILLS.

LET ME SEE.

MAGAZINES...

UH, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.

YEP.
THANK YOU.

HOWDY.

HERE IS MY ENTRY
FOR THE MAGAZINE.

UH, GREAT.
IS IT ABOUT CONTRACEPTION?

YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT MUST BE REALLY NICE

TO HAVE PLANS
TO JOURNEY OUT INTO THE WORLD,

BUT SOME OF US
DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.

SOME OF US ARE STUCK HERE
AND HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT,

SO EXCUSE ME FOR WANTING TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN MY SENIOR YEAR.

IT COULD BE
THE LAST CHANCE THAT I GET.

AND WHY ARE YOU INCAPABLE?

WHY ARE YOU STUCK HERE?

SECOND GRADE
MRS. McCOY'S CLASSROOM.

I DOUBT
YOU REMEMBER THIS,
BUT I DO.

WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM AND
WE ALL SAID WHAT WE WANTED TO BE

WHEN WE GREW UP.
I SAID THAT I WANTED TO BE
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER

AND YOU SAID...
I WANTED TO BE A BALLERINA.

WHAT STOPPED YOU?

THEY ALL LAUGHED AT ME.
BUT I DIDN'T LAUGH AT YOU.

IN WHAT GRADE DO WE
STOP BELIEVING IN OURSELVES?

WELL, WHAT GRADE DO WE
JUST STOP BELIEVING PERIOD?

I MEAN, SOMEONE HAS TO BE
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER.

SOMEONE
HAS TO BE A BALLERINA.

WHY NOT US?


NOW I CAN'T BE
THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS THAT.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

YOU KNOW,
WHEN I'M HERE AT SCHOOL,

I JUST TURN MY PHONE OFF

SO THAT I DON'T HEAR IT
NOT RINGING.

[RINGING CONTINUES]
WHO IS IT?

IT'S...MY DAD.

HELLO?

HEY, CARSON.

I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CALL YOU AFTER SCHOOL.
I'M SURE YOU'RE BUSY

WITH YOUR HOMEWORK AND SO FORTH
BUT I GOT SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS

I WANNA TELL YOU.
YEAH, I'M GETTING MARRIED.
HER NAME'S APRIL.

WE'RE EXPECTING
A BABY AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A BABY BROTHER.

YOU GOTTA BE SHITTING ME.

SO ANYWAY,
SHE WANTS TO MEET YOU.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE

YOU COULD MAKE IT
OVER FOR DINNER SOMETIME SOON?

I...I'D HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

PLEASE DO.
IN FACT,

I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON. 'KAY?

'KAY.
 <i>'KAY, BYE.</i>

WHAT HAPPENED?

UH, UM...

APPARENTLY,
MY DAD'S GETTING MARRIED.

CONGRATULATIONS.

I GUESS.

WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

AH...

I'M GONNA GO
HAVE DINNER WITH DAD.

WHY?
UM...

APPARENTLY,
HE'S GETTING MARRIED.

GOOD FOR HIM.

HE WANTS ME
TO GO MEET HIS FIANCE SO...

HAVE FUN.

BE HOME AT A DECENT HOUR AND,

AND ALL THAT
PARENTING SHIT.

BYE, MOM.

LOVE YOU.

[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

YOUR DAD TELLS ME
YOU'RE QUITE POPULAR AT SCHOOL.


NO.

I'M ACTIVE,
BUT I'M, I'M NOT POPULAR.

WELL, HE'S PART OF
THE NEWSPAPER CLUB.

ACTUALLY,
I'M PRESIDENT OF
THE WRITERS' CLUB.

EDITOR OF
THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER,

AND I RECENTLY JUST STARTED
A LITERARY MAGAZINE.

CHECK YOU OUT.
YOU MUST GET REALLY GOOD GRADES.

YEAH,
HE DOES PRETTY WELL.

I HAVE A 4.3.
I WOULD HAVE A 4.5,

BUT I TEND
TO ARGUE WITH THE TEACHERS
AND THEIR LESSON PLANS SO.

WELL,
DO YOU PLAY SPORTS?


I'M JUST...

I MEAN...

GOD KNOWS I TRIED.
WE'D ALWAYS GO DOWN

TO THE PARK...
DID WE?

THROW THE BALL AROUND,
BUT HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY INTEREST.

SO I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT
I DIDN'T GET THAT MAJOR LEAGUER

I WAS HOPING FOR.
HE KIND OF THREW LIKE A GIRL.

DAD, WE, WE NEVER DID THAT.
WELL, SURE WE DID.

YOU JUST DON'T REMEMBER.
I DON'T THINK YOU REMEMBER.

NO, I WOULD REMEMBER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

HE'S ACTUALLY EXAGGERATING.
HE'S GOT A VERY SORT OF

CREATIVE IMAGINATION.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM

SUCH A GOOD WRITER.
WHO ARE YOU PRETENDING TO BE?

LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU LEFT WHAT,

LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I'VE
SEEN YOU TWICE SINCE THEN?

YOU'RE YOUNG,
MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

HOW YOU COULD JUST
ABANDON YOUR OLD FAMILY
AND THEN ACT LIKE

EVERYTHING IS OKAY
IN FRONT OF THE NEW ONE.

CARSON, YOUR MOM'S UNSTABLE.
YEAH, I KNOW.

AND YOU LEFT ME WITH HER.
CARSON...

YEAH, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T...

THANK YOU, APRIL.
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

IT WAS LOVELY MEETING YOU,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

CARSON, I CAN ONLY SAY SORRY
A NUMBER OF TIMES, BUT...

[SLAMS DOOR]

WELL,
HE'S HIS MOTHER'S SON.

<i>[TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]</i>

<i>[TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]</i>

<i>[PRINCIPAL] I'VE CALLED YOU</i>
<i>IN HERE TODAY TO ANNOUNCE</i>

<i>A NEW DISTRICT RULE MYSELF</i>

<i>AND THE REST OF</i>
<i>THE PRINCIPAL BOARD FEEL</i>
<i>VERY STRONGLY ABOUT.</i>

SO STARTING NEXT SEMESTER,

ALL BOOK COVERS,
BACKPACKS AND CLOTHING

DISPLAYING LOGOS AND WRITING
ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

SO AS COUNCIL MEMBERS,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

THAT YOU HONOR THIS RULE
AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP

BY FOLLOWING IT.
OKAY, AGREED,

I HATE SOME OF THE OBNOXIOUS
AND DEGRADING THINGS

THAT I READ EVERYDAY,
AND IF I SEE ONE MORE PERSON

WEARING ONE OF THOSE SHIRTS
THAT SAYS, "I DO MY OWN STUNTS,"

I'M GONNA PHYSICALLY RIP OFF
MY FACE AND THROW IT AT THEM.

BUT I MEAN, HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO LEARN AND GROW

WHEN YOU KEEP TAKING
AWAY OUR BASIC FREEDOMS
OF SELF EXPRESSION?

TELL YOU WHAT, BUDDY,

WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET US
WORRY ABOUT STUDENT SUPPRESSION?

HOW'S THAT?
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

YOU PEOPLE MUST KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING SINCE

MORE STUDENTS
ARE MORE DEPRESSED,
MORE STRESSED

AND DROPPING OUT NOW
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE

SO YOU'RE DOING
A REAL GREAT JOB
WITH THE DECISIONS.

YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.
YOU'RE ON A POWER TRIP.

HOW DOES BANNING LOGOS
DO ANYTHING EXCEPT HELP YOUR OWN

CONSERVATIVE AGENDAS?
THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER, OKAY?

YOU WILL
FOLLOW THE NEW RULES.
AND BECAUSE OF

YOUR DISRESPECTFUL ATTITUDE,

I HEREBY REVOKE ALL STUDENT
OFF-CAMPUS PRIVILEGES

FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

YOUR PEERS CAN THANK YOU,
LITTLE MAN.

LET'S GO, GUYS.

AAH! YOU CAN'T PUNISH
THE WHOLE SCHOOL

FOR ONE STUDENT'S
BIG MOUTH!

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ALL JUST SAT THERE!

OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE STILL
PUTTING THE BLAME ON US.

THANKS TO YOU,
WE HAVE TO HAVE PROM
IN THE CAFETERIA.

WE'LL BE SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME THERE SINCE WE CAN'T
GO OFF CAMPUS TO EAT ANYMORE.

IF YOU WRITE AN APOLOGY LETTER,
MAYBE THEY'D RECONSIDER.

HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

HM-HMM, WHAT ABOUT
NEXT WEEK AT ASSEMBLY?

OH, CARSON, YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN US

BECAUSE WE ALL
COULDN'T STAND YOU,

BUT GET READY FOR
PURE HATRED COMING YOUR WAY
BECAUSE AS SOON AS

THE REST OF THE SCHOOL
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS

AND THEY TELL THEIR PARENTS,
THE ENTIRE TOWN WILL ACTUALLY

HATE YOU!
ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?!

I DIDN'T JUST
STAND UP FOR MYSELF IN THERE,

I WAS STANDING UP
FOR ALL OF YOU!

THE MINUTE YOU GUYS
WALKED INTO THIS CAMPUS,

YOU WERE LABELED
AS HIGH SCHOOL ROYALTY,

AND YOU'D RATHER
MAINTAIN THAT LABEL
THAN HEAVEN FORBID

STAND UP FOR YOURSELVES!

BUT HIGH SCHOOL ENDS,
AND FOR YOUR SAKES,

I HOPE GUYS AREN'T
THE WALKING CLICHES

EVERYONE THINKS YOU ARE!
'CAUSE LIFE IS GONNA

WALK ALL OVER YOU
AND IT'S GONNA
BITE YOU IN THE ASS!

WE ARE NOT CLICHES.

I TRIED AVOIDING YOU
AS LONG AS I COULD,

BUT THIS IS
THE ONLY PHARMACY IN TOWN,

AND I'M STARTING
TO GO THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.
SO I NEED MY REFILLS.

I FIGURED AS MUCH.

WOW. I KNOW WHAT
YOU MUST THINK OF ME.

PATHETIC DIVORCEE
WHO TURNED HERSELF INTO THIS.

WELL, THIS ISN'T
THE LIFE YOU WANT.

I GAVE HIM MY LIFE...

ONLY TO BE TOSSED ASIDE

WHEN HE DECIDED
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

THIS WAS
NEVER A PART OF MY

PICKET FENCE FANTASY.

YOU AND I
AREN'T SO DIFFERENT.

I HAD A KID
TO SAVE A MARRIAGE,

AND YOU'RE HAVING ONE
TO ENSURE ONE.

SO YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO QUICK TO JUDGE.

ESPECIALLY YOU.

'CAUSE I WAS YOU...

AND NOW I'M THIS.

SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T GET IT.

LIFE.

I MEAN, WHY DO
SOME OF US HAVE TO WORK

SO HARD FOR THINGS
WE BELIEVE IN

AND OTHERS DON'T?

I MEAN, WHY DO
SOME OF US CARE SO MUCH?

I MEAN, WHY ARE SOME OF US
SELFISH BY NATURE AND...

SOME OF US
ARE SELFISH TO SURVIVE?

DEAR, I'M MAKING THIS
FOR MY GRANDSON.

WH-WHAT IS IT?

A SCARF BLANKET.
[LAUGHS]

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>I WANTED TO BE HEARD SO BAD</i>

<i>THAT I NEVER</i>
<i>THOUGHT ABOUT LISTENING.</i>

<i>BUT WHAT I REGRETTED THE MOST</i>

<i>WAS THAT I LIVED EVERY DAY</i>
<i>WAITING FOR MY LIFE TO BEGIN.</i>

WHAT'S THIS?

IT'S A MAGAZINE.

DICK.

<i>THE HIGHER YOUR CLOUD,</i>
<i>THE FURTHER YOUR RAIN FALLS.</i>

IT'S FULL OF LITERARY STUFF.

THREE DOLLARS.

<i>I SOON LEARNED</i>
<i>THAT WHEN IT RAINS</i>

<i>IT POURS.</i>

ALL RIGHT.

I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?

THEY WON'T LET YOU REAPPLY.

YOU WERE ACCEPTED,
BUT YOU NEVER CONFIRMED.

SO YOU WERE DENIED.

NO, IT MUST'VE GOTTEN LOST
IN THE MAIL. I...

I CHECKED EVERY DAY.

PLEASE, YOU-YOU--
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT.

I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO ANYMORE FOR YOU.
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS GO

TO YOUR SECOND CHOICE SCHOOL.
THERE WAS NO SECOND CHOICE.

OH. WELL, YOU CAN
APPLY AGAIN IN TWO YEARS

AFTER YOU COMPLETE
YOUR GE REQUIREMENTS.

CLOVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE
IS STILL ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.

WOULD YOU
LIKE TO FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION?

CARSON...

WOULD YOU LIKE
TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION?

YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE OCEAN.

<i>[ANSWERING MACHINE]</i>
<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

<i>[SHERYL]</i>
<i>UH, CARSON, GRANDMA FELL,</i>
<i>AND YOU GOTTA GET...</i>

<i>GET OVER HERE</i>
<i>AS SOON AS YOU CAN.</i>

<i>[TV]</i>
<i>YOU CAN EXPECT SOME</i>
<i>LIGHT SHOWERS</i>

<i>AND A POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM</i>
<i>BY THE END OF THE WEEK.</i>

<i>YOU CAN EXPECT</i>
<i>CLEAR SKIES AFTERWARDS THOUGH</i>
<i>UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY.</i>

WHERE WERE YOU?
FINE, DON'T TELL ME.

BUT IF YOU WERE
AT YOUR FATHER'S,
I'D BE FINE WITH IT.

HOW IS SHE?
SHE'S FINE.

BRUISED HER HIP
BUT NOTHING'S BROKEN.

I'M GONNA GET SOME COFFEE,
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING?

NO.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?
YOU FELL AND HURT YOURSELF.

YOU REMIND ME OF MY GRANDSON.
I DO?

WHY IS THAT?
YOU'RE SAD LOOKING.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

THEY'RE GIVING HER A BATH.

WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

I GOT INTO NORTHWESTERN

BUT I NEVER GOT A LETTER.

SO...

I HAVE TO WAIT
TWO YEARS TO REAPPLY.

I THREW YOUR LETTER AWAY.

WHAT?!
I'M SORRY.

HOW COULD YOU
THROW MY LETTER AWAY?!

I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU.
PROTECT ME?!

I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT LIKE I DID.

ALL YOUR TALK ABOUT GROWING UP
AND BECOMING A WRITER AND ALL...

ALL THESE
DELUSIONS YOU HAVE
WON'T HAPPEN.

DREAMS DON'T COME TRUE,
CARSON.

TAKE IF FROM ME,
I AM LIVING PROOF.

THE WORLD
IS A VERY CRUEL PLACE.
YOU WOULD'VE LEFT,

BEEN EATEN ALIVE,
COME BACK UTTERLY DESTROYED,

AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT.
I WANTED BETTER FOR YOU.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

LIFE IS UNFAIR,
YOU KNOW, IT IS.

AND THE SOONER YOU REALIZE THAT,
THE FASTER YOU GROW UP.

AND THE FASTER YOU GROW UP,
THE SOONER YOU'LL SEE

THE WORLD
FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS.

YOU KNOW, THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR BEING
THE PERFECT EXAMPLE

OF SOMETHING
THAT I REFUSE TO BECOME!

â™ª BAD DAY
YOU'RE LOOKING FAR AWAY â™ª

â™ª OH, LOOKING
FOR THE GREAT ESCAPE â™ª

â™ª GETS IN HIS CAR

â™ª AND DRIVES AWAY

â™ª FAR FROM
ALL THE THINGS â™ª

â™ª THAT WE ARE

â™ª FORCE A SMILE...

â™ª FORCE A SMILE...

â™ª FORCE A SMILE...

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

CARSON, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

<i>I NEED TO APOLOGIZE.</i>

<i>I NEED TO APOLOGIZE.</i>

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH ALL OF THESE?

I'M DONATING THEM
TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOME.
THEY'RE SENDING SOMEONE

AFTER SCHOOL
TO COME AND PICK 'EM UP
AND PASS 'EM OUT.

AT LEAST THEY'LL BE READ.

OR CHEWED.

I'M SO SORRY
THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT

THE WAY THAT
YOU WANTED THEM TO.

ME, TOO.

LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE SEEING YOU
AROUND CLOVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

MAYBE WE'LL BE ADVENTUROUS

AND START
A LITERARY MAGAZINE THERE.

MALERIE,
WHY DO YOU FILM EVERYTHING?

I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER...

EVERYTHING.

WHAT ISN'T WORTH REMEMBERING?

WITH GOOD MEMORIES
COME BAD MEMORIES,

AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF BOTH.

AT LEAST THIS WAY
I CAN FAST FORWARD THROUGH
ALL THE BAD STUFF.

A COUNSELOR ONCE TOLD ME

THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE STUCK IN THE PAST

OR IF YOU
TRY TO FORGET THE PAST.

WHAT MATTERS IS
WHAT YOU DO IN THE PRESENT.

THAT'S WHY
I JUST TRY TO SOAK IT UP
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

I THINK YOU JUST FOUND
SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT.

[PERIOD BELL RINGS]
I GOTTA GO.

IF I'M LATE FOR THE BUS,

THE DRIVER SAID
HE'D MAKE ME RIDE IN THE TRUNK.

IT IS NOT FUN.

CARSON.

ARE WE...

FRIENDS?

I THINK WE'RE BEST FRIENDS,
MALERIE.

COOL.

COOL.

COOL.

<i>[GRANDMA] HE USED TO BE</i>
<i>SUCH A HAPPY BOY.</i>

HE USED TO WRITE ME STORIES.

I REMEMBER THE FIRST STORY

HE EVER WROTE ME.

"ONCE UPON A TIME
THERE WAS A BOY."


THEN IT BECAME,

"ONCE UPON A TIME
THERE WAS A BOY

WHO WANTED TO FLY."

AND IT JUST GOT
BETTER AND BETTER OVER TIME.

NOW I NEVER DID FIND OUT
WHETHER THE BOY GOT TO FLY.

<i>[CARSON] AND THEN</i>
<i>IT SUDDENLY CAME TO ME.</i>

<i>I HAD ONE MORE STORY TO ADD.</i>

<i>I HAD BEEN SO BUSY</i>
<i>DWELLING IN MY OWN SELF-PITY</i>

<i>I HAD FORGOTTEN</i>
<i>WHAT I ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED.</i>

<i>I SUCCESSFULLY</i>
<i>PUBLISHED A LITERARY MAGAZINE</i>

<i>FILLED WITH THE THOUGHTS,</i>

<i>CONCERNS,</i>
<i>HOPES AND IMAGINATIONS</i>

<i>OF MY JADED HIGH SCHOOL PEERS.</i>

<i>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,</i>

<i>I WAS TRULY HAPPY.</i>

<i>[THUNDERCLAP]</i>

<i>[SHERYL]</i>
<i>CARSON, WHERE ARE YOU?</i>

SCHOOL ENDED THREE HOURS AGO.
WHAT ARE YOU, AT YOUR FATHER'S?

ARE YOU TWO LIKE
BEST FRIENDS NOW OR SOMETHING?

JUST CALL ME BACK.

<i>[CARSON] I DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT'S MORE PATHETIC,</i>

<i>THE FACT THAT I WAS</i>
<i>ACTUALLY STRUCK BY LIGHTNING</i>

<i>OR THAT IT TOOK THREE DAYS</i>
<i>FOR ANYONE TO FIND MY BODY.</i>

WHOA.

IT'S CARSON PHILLIPS,
HE'S DEAD.

<i>[DOORBELL RINGS]</i>

WHAT?!

ARE YOU SHERYL PHILLIPS?

<i>[ANSWERING MACHINE]</i>
<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

CARSON?
 <i>[BEEP]</i>

I NEED YOU
TO COME HOME RIGHT NOW!
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

AHH! CARSON!

THERE ARE COPS OUTSIDE
THAT SAY YOU'RE DEAD!

I NEED YOU TO CO...

I NEED YOU TO COME HOME!
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

I NEED YOU
TO COME HOME RIGHT NOW!

<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

<i>[MACHINE BEEPS]</i>

PLEASE ANSWER YOUR PHONE.
ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.


I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

<i>[BEEP]</i>

<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED CARSON.</i>
<i>LEAVE A MESSAGE, MOM.</i>

<i>[BEEP]</i>

RIGHT HERE WHERE I'M STANDING,

<i>CLOVER HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR</i>
<i>CARSON PHILLIPS LOST HIS LIFE</i>

<i>WHEN HE WAS</i>
<i>STRUCK MY LIGHTNING.</i>

<i>A SERVICE</i>
<i>WILL BE HELD THIS SUNDAY</i>

<i>AT CLOVER COMMUNITY CHAPEL.</i>
<i>HE WILL BE MISSED.</i>

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>IT'S AMAZING HOW POPULAR</i>
<i>YOU BECOME ONCE YOU DIE.</i>

I THINK I SPEAK
FOR THE ENTIRE FACULTY

WHEN I SAY...

YOUR SON WAS AN ABSOLUTE JOY.

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>OH, KISS MY EMBALMED ASS.</i>

<i>DEATH CHANGES THINGS I GUESS,</i>

<i>BUT EVEN DEATH COULDN'T SUIT</i>

<i>SOME OF</i>
<i>THE IMPRESSIONS I LEFT.</i>

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

YOUR BOOK CLUB WILL NOT
SPARE A PAGE TO REMIND PEOPLE

THAT CARSON PHILLIPS
WAS ZAPPED IN THE PARKING LOT.

SIR, THOSE PAGES
ARE RESERVED FOR PROM.

I'M JUST SAYING ONE PAGE.
PLANT A TREE.

HOW DO I BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE CARSON PHILLIPS?

<i>[CARSON] I NEVER GRADUATED,</i>
<i>I NEVER WENT TO NORTHWESTERN,</i>

<i>I NEVER WROTE</i>
<i>FOR "THE NEW YORKER,"</i>

<i>I NEVER WON</i>
<i>THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,</i>

<i>I NEVER CHANGED THE WORLD.</i>

<i>I NEVER GOT OUT OF CLOVER.</i>

<i>- [CARSON] IT'S A LOT LIKE...</i>
<i>- [MALERIE] LIGHTNING.</i>

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>YEAH, EXACTLY.</i>

<i>THESE WERE JUST DELUSIONS</i>
<i>THAT OCCUPIED MY TIME.</i>

<i>AND THANK GOD THEY DID.</i>

<i>[CLAIRE]</i>
<i>OKAY, SO WE ALL AGREE,</i>

LEOPARD PRINT WILL BE OUR THEME
FOR OUR SAFARI PROM.

AND OF COURSE
IT WILL ALL BE FAUX FUR.

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>BECAUSE A LIFE WITHOUT</i>
<i>MEANING, WITHOUT DRIVE,</i>

<i>- WITHOUT FOCUS...</i>
<i>- ON SECOND THOUGHT,</i>

THE SAFARI PROM IDEA
KINDA SUCKS.

LET'S COME UP
WITH SOMETHING BETTER.

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>WITHOUT GOALS OR DREAMS...</i>

<i>ISN'T A LIFE WORTH LIVING.</i>

"TO GRANDMA,

"ONCE UPON A TIME

THERE WAS A BOY WHO FLEW."

<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>LIFE COMES AT YOU FAST,</i>

<i>IT RUNS THROUGH YOUR BODY</i>
<i>AND TRIES TO ESCAPE</i>

<i>AND BE EXPRESSED</i>
<i>IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.</i>

<i>IN A WAY,</i>
<i>IT'S A LOT LIKE...</i>

<i>LIGHTNING.</i>

â™ª I'VE BEEN
ALL OVER THE WORLD â™ª
