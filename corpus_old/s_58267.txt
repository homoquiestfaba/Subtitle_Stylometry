[Hip-Hop]

Man, put that shit out.

[Man #2 Exhales]
You know the doctor
prescribed me this shit, now.

New Line presents
a real nigga movie.

[Man #1] Yeah.
[Both Giggling]

[Man #2]
I'm high as a giraffe ass
right now.

[Man #2]
Ooh. "A Cubevision production."
[Man #1] Right now.

[Man #2] Man, this shit
gonna be off the hook, nigga.
[Man #1] Yeah.

[Man #2]
Hit it again, Smokey.

Puff it up your nose,
nigga.

[Man #2]
"Next Friday."
This shit is on the one.

It's another one on this one.
Yeah, buddy.

[Man #1] Yeah.
[Man #2] Got a bong, nigga,

[Man #1] Naw.
[Man #2] 'Cause this shit

[Man #2]
"Written by Ice Cube."

[Man #2] I thought

"Directed by Steve Carr."
Oh.

Hey man, that dude...

[Man #1] Shh! Shh! Shh!

[Sirens Blaring]
[Dogs Barking]

[Man #3]
In the movies, when you
beat up the neighbourhood bully,

you're supposed to live
happily ever after.

But in my neighbourhood,
that's when all
the drama starts.

It was a Friday
I'd never forget.

I got high
for the first time,

I got shot at
for the first time,

and I finally
kicked Debo's ass
for the first time.

Debo ended up going to jail
for about four years.

[Man #4]
You win some,
you lose some,

but you live, you live
to fight another day.

[Man #3]
Now, there's rumours
goin'around the hood...

sayin'Debo is supposed to
break out next Friday.

And when he gets out,
he's supposed to
come and see me.

And today is next Friday,
and I still ain't got no job.

Come on! Come on!

Come on.

Come on!
[I ndistinct]

Now, as soon as my pops
found out Debo
was gettin'out,

he wanted me to move
with my uncle and little cousin
in Rancho Cucamonga...

till things calm down...

or Debo went back to prison,
whichever comes first.


How can you
just stay in your seat

The music's pumpin'
so get on your feet

Craig, off your ass
and on your feet! This ain't
no time to beat your meat.

All right.

I'll be out in about
35, 45 minutes.

You'll go blind, boy.

You hurry up,
'cause this is Friday.
We gotta hit the highway.

[Craig's Voice]
I feel like the biggest punk
around here.

I whipped Debo's ass.

He should be the one movin'.

[Crossing Bells Ringing]
Chase me

[Continues, Indistinct]

[Blow Landing]

Where am I gonna ride at?
Shut up, punk.
You're walkin'.

But I'm tired, man!

Chase me through the night

So come on
Come on! Come on!


Craig!
Will you come on?

I don't wanna hit
that morning traffic.

You had enough time
to get yourself together.

I don't believe this.

I told that hard-head boy
to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

Look at that grass.
Stanley's grass look good.

Miss Johnson's grass look good.
But look at my grass... no.

Look at that grass.
Boy, when that boy
get out of my house,

I'm gonna
change my number.

Craig! Hey!
Come on out of that house!
Ohh...

Oh, damn!

Goodness gracious.
What...

What is goin' on here?
Whoa.

Oh, man.


Use that brick
to break that chain.

You think this the same brick
Craig knocked your ass
out with?

Get outta here,
you stupid mother...

Craig! Craig!

Here I come.
Will you bring your ass?

Come on, man.
You got me tryin' to break
a chain with a brick?

Man, let's go get some pussy,
Debo, man, fuck!

Shit, man!
Fuckin' fool.

I got some unfinished business
to deal with, and your butt
gonna wait too.

Golly, what's the matter?

I fell in some mud,
and it's all your fault.

How's it my fault?
Well, you're
takin' all day.

And I told you to
put that hose away
and cut that grass.

Boy, I didn't drop you on your
head when you were a kid.
What's wrong with you?

Maybe your grandmother did.
I remember, summer of '75...

leave my neighbourhood at all,
[Continues, Indistinct]

especially my homeboy Smokey.

But he went
to rehab last month,

and the way he smoke,
ain't no tellin' when
he gettin'out.

I'm gonna sure miss him.

I hate you, man.
Hey, hey, hey.

Here come that dog truck.
Shut your mouth.

We about to
fade to black.

Hey, stop!
Aaaah!

Get your little punk ass
out the car, Craig!

This is the rematch!
Yeah, boy, the rematch!

Think I'm gonna let you beat up
on my big brother like that
and get away with it?

Come on,
get out the car!
Punch it!

I got your butt now!
Uh-huh.

Debo!

Fake-ass Suge Knight!

[Tyres Screeching]
Debo.

Yeah, I'm gonna find you!
And when I do, I'm gonna
put my foot up in your ass!

Get up!
[Blow Landing]

Damn! Man, I ain't
kickin' it with you no more!

I'm goin' to Mommy house, man.

Did you see that?
Them niggas just like
some wild pit bull dogs.

That's why movin'
with your Uncle Elroy...

and your cousin Day-Day
is the best thing
to happen to you now.

Your sister moved out, son.
It's time for you
to move out too.

It's time for your mother
and I to walk around the house
butt naked if we want to.

What? Y'all tryin'
to walk around the house
butt naked?

Yes, we are.

We're gonna do it tonight
when I get off of work.

Oh, I can't wait to see
your mama naked.
That big old booty...

bouncin' around,
boom, boom, boom.

High-heel shoes on, man,
walkin'on that shag rug.

Givin'me a lap dance, boy.
And my johnson swingin',
whoomp, whoomp.

Daddy.
Ball goin' one way,
johnson goin' the other way.

Look. Whoomp.
The ball-johnson dance.
Daddy!

[Singing Nonsense
Syllables]
I don't want to hear that.

What's that smell?

your upper lip, son.

I don't smell nothin'.
I do.

What it smell like?
Smell like you didn't
fall in no mud.


We'll use this spray, son.
That's all you gotta do. That's
what I got this stuff for.

Hold on! Too much!

What's wrong
with this window?
That window don't come down.

Remind me to get it fixed.
Oh, damn!

Bad luck

That's what you got
That's what you got

Bad luck

That's what you got
That's what you got
You got bad luck

That's what you got
That's what you got
You got bad luck

Bad luck, bad luck
Bad, bad, bad, bad
bad luck

No, don't we
[Horn Honking]

Nice neighbourhood, huh?
It's all right.

Fake-ass Brady Bunch.

Eighteen years, son.
Eighteen years...

I've been chasin'
nasty, stinkin',
dirty, filthy dogs.

Mmm.
I've been bitten by every
dog there is in the world...

pit bulls, boxers,
collies, seeing eye dogs.

What about a chihuahua?
Twice.

Then there's
my brother Elroy.

Everybody loves Elroy.

A lazy nothin'.
Hit the Lotto.

I just can't
understand it.

All right.

You comin' in?
Oh, hell, no.
I ain't goin' in there.

I don't want to see
Elroy's face or smell
his stinkin' breath.

Now, Craig, it's gonna be
different living out here.

Don't let your uncle
or your cousin get you
into any kind of shit.

Now, you hear me?
Pops, I'm grown now.

Can't nobody
get me in trouble no more.
I'm glad you said that, son.

'Cause since you grown,
don't bring your
black ass back home.

Daddy, Craig's here!

[Both Laughing]
[Day-Day]
What's crackin'?

Damn.

Hey, Uncle Willie.
Hey, how you doin',
Day-Day?

Where's your
big-head father?
There he is right there.

Hey, Craig!
Hey, Unc!


I heard you runnin'
from an ass whippin'.
It ain't even like that.

Talk to your brother.
If it had been me,
I'd have shot his big ass.

He'd have popped him.
I know he would have
popped him.

Hey, Willie.
How's it goin'?

Still steppin'
in that dog shit every day?


Just make sure you
take care of my boy.
Don't
worry about nothin, big bro.

He in the best fuckin' hands
in Rancho "Choke-among-us."

Shit, I'm the king around here.
You're just another nigga
late payin' his rent.

Ain't that right, nephew?
Yeah.

Hey, Craig?
Huh?

Remember what I
told you.
I'll remember.

Now, Lotto stud,
close my door,
and don't slam it.

Can't even count to ten,
all of a sudden you can
hit the Lotto.

Ain't that a bitch.

Hey, send Betty my love!

Boy, you lookin' good.
I can't call it.

Give me that bag.
I'm gonna take this stuff
in the house for you.

When you finish with him,
come on in.
All right. Thanks, Unc.

Damn.
Yeah. Man, it's been
what, a year...

since the last time we kicked it
at the family reunion?

Yeah, it was about
a year, huh? Damn.
Yeah, man.

Ever since y'all moved
out here, man, it seems like
we lost touch or somethin'.

I know. This is a long way
from Watts, huh?
Yeah.

But you know what?
The good thing about
being out here,

we don't hear no gunshots,
no helicopters,

no police, no crackheads,
no chickenheads, no nothin'.

Yeah.
Just clean, fresh air.

Just smell.
Smell good, huh?

Tastes good.
Taste the air. Aw, man!

Aw, man.
Aw, shit.

[Hip Hop
Blaring From Stereo]

[Hydraulics Hissing]

Who's that?
Some joker brothers.

That's Joker.
He just got out the pen.

And then there's Little Joker.
He just got out of Y.A.

And then there's
Baby Joker right there.

He just got out the juvenile
centre. And then they got
a little dog named Cheeco.

You better watch him,
'cause he's sneaky.
He'll bite the shit out of you.

But I got somethin'
better than that Cadillac.
What's that?

Peep this. Come on.
Ha! What?

Check this out.

This you?

Yeah. A little
somethin'-somethin' I picked up.
You diggin' that look there?

Damn. I wish we
hit the Lotto and came up on
a million dollars like y'all.

Man, after payin' taxes
and lawyer fees and all of
Daddy's bad-ass credit,

buyin' Viagra, trickin'
with these sack chasers
around here,

thirty and 40 dollars
every now and then, I ain't
end up with a million dollars.

We end up with this crib
and this bad motherfucker
right here.

This my baby, man.
Yeah, it's off the hook.

You like that, huh?
Got some twenties on there.
Yeah, I do.

Them twenties, I just got them.
Them ain't twenties,
but it's off the hook.

Them are twenties, man.
Them... Naw, they tens.

I bought 'em from somebody.
But they... they...
they nice, though.

Yeah, they cool.
Yeah, they tight.

And then, you know, since I had
this, my pussy-rate thing went...

I get more pussy
from police ladies.

Everybody give me
some pussy.
What up, Day-Day?

Oh, this lady
is funny, man.

She used to own a record booth
down in the Slauson Swap Meet.

She is funny as hell.
Come on, let's go.

What up, Mulan?
Hey, wait!

Don't be steppin'
on those flowers, motherfucker.
I just planted that shit.

Who's your boy?

This is my cousin Craig.
He from L.A.
Craig, meet Miss Ho.

Ho-Kym, motherfucker.
Day-Day's just trying
to be a smart-ass.

Nice to meet you, Craig.

Oh.

Yo, Day-Day. Something's
going down with those
eses across the street.

Yeah, I've been seeing
a lot of activity.

What kind of activity?
Strange activity.

I think they're
running drugs from Tijuana.

Day-Day don't believe me.
Well, I ain't got time
and got to go, Miss Ho.

Ah, I'm just kiddin'.
Come by after work.

I got the John Blaze
shit for you.

Nice to meet you.
Peace out, Craig.

Yeah, peace out.

Yeah, bye.
See you later.
Aw, man.

Nice hat.

Told you
she was funny.
Yeah, she is.


Good house,
ain't it?
Yeah, it is.

Yeah, see. Y'all wish
y'all had one like this,
didn't you?

Yeah, we do.
Yeah.
Daddy!

Where my shirt at?
Daddy, where my shirt?

Which one, the pink one?
[Day-Day] Hell, yeah!

Ran out of toilet paper, son.
Sorry about that.

Sure was soft, though.
[Day-Day] You wiped
your ass with my shirt?

Told you not to leave
your shit in the bathroom.

What's up?
What are you doin'?
It's a nice house, man.

For real.
I know. Thanks.

I just wish Mama
had a chance to see it.

You know she had a heart attack
and died when she found out
we won the lottery.

Yeah, I know the story.
If mama had the chance
to see this,

she'd have been
so happy, man.

But that's how
things work.

Well, I'm about to get ready
to go to work,

somethin' you might not
never know nothin' about.

You know
what I'm sayin'?
Where you workin' at now?

Down at Pinky's Record and Disc
down at the shopping centre.

You can't live in this house
without a job, so try to
think about that,

'cause I got me
a jizz-ob.

Ajizz-ob, a jizz-ob,
a jizz-ob.

Damn.
[Squeaking Sound]

Suga?

Suga?
I'm comin'!

Craig, I want you to meet
my old lady Suga.

Suga, my nephew, Craig.

Ooh, you even cuter
than your baby pictures.

Thank you.
Oh, honey.

You know we can keep it
all in the family.

Ooh, you got
a fat ass.

All right, all right,
all right! That's enough!

Shit! That's enough!
Go on back upstairs...

and put on
some damn clothes!

Go on, now!
Help me out.

[Slaps Buttocks]
Ooh.
Nice meeting you, Craig.

Nice to meet you.

Boy, that woman gonna be
the death of me one day.
You watch.

Viagra ain't workin',
my back keeps goin' out.

That freak can't get enough
of your Uncle Elroy.
Mmm.

But check this out. Got to lay
some ground rules down on you.
[Squeaking Sound]

You family. I love you.

I Love you too, Unc.
You're welcome to anything
in my house.

But don't let me catch you
in my refrigerator.

Don't let me catch you
with your finger
in my sugar bowl.

You feel me knockin'?
I feel you.

Well, let me in!

Unc, who's that out there
with Day-Day's car?
That's D'wana.

Boy's ex.
Hey, Day-Day!

That crazy bitch
out there again!

What's she doin'
with that big-ass key?

Aw, shit!

She writin'on it?
Scratchin' the shit
out of it!

Goddamn!

Why y'all standin' there
just lookin' and shit?
Do somethin'!

Huggin' and shit.
Just standin' there.

Girl, you supposed to be
1,000 feet away from my house.
What you doin' over here?

[D'wana]
What it look like, nigga?
You can't quit me.

I'm pregnant
with your baby.
That ain't my baby.

That's my baby right there.
Aw, man.

You keyed my sh...
Bitch, you...

You keyed my shit.
I got your bitch right here.

Yeah, nigga, yeah!
[Shouting, I ndistinct]
Daddy, she sprayed me!

Shut up,
you little punk!
Don't nobody quit me.

You wait till I tell Baby D'.
She gonna fuck you up!

[Day-Day]
She sprayed the player!
She sprayed the pimp!

Better watch your back!
[Craig]
Come on, be still!

Boy, it look like you got
a fatal attraction
on your hands, ain't you?

I had two or three
of them in my day.

Craig,

I hope you can handle
your women better
than this fool can.

That's too much water.

Ah, no, it ain't.
Take 20 minutes.

I've been pepper sprayed
nine times. Take 20 minutes.

He got 19 to go.

Come on, Craig, let me
show you the back yard.

You know it's bigger
than y'all's back yard.
[Continues Grunting]

Call the police and tell them
to get me another
restraining order!

Yeah, Craig, you gotta
have a little money
to live out here.

Yeah.
Got to have it. Now, I know
what you're thinkin'.

I was the one back in the day
always talkin' about...

"I love the hood,
I love the ghetto."

I was the one sayin'
I wasn't the kind of nigga...

make a little money
and run to the suburbs.

You right, that's what I said.
But as soon as I got my cheque,
I was gone!

Paid $ 230,000 cash
on this place.

Paid cash
for this, Unc?
Cash money!

Try to stick me with some
thirty-year payment plan.
That's for suckers.

Got my daddy like that
years ago on a Cadillac.
Mmm.

I got the only house
on the block paid for.

That's why I'm the king
around here.

Yeah, you are
the king, huh?
How you like that pool?

Big, ain't it?
Yeah, it's cool.

Where the water at?

Don't need no water!
We ain't got no pools
in the projects.

None of us swim.

So, y'all don't
never use it?
Never.

But the jacuzzi,
that's something else,

'cause me and my Suga
get real nasty in there.

Guess I left that
in there.

You welcome to use it
any time you want. Shit.

You my brother's boy!

That's all right, Unc.
Can't swim neither.

No? Good.

I won't have to clean up
behind your ass.

Come on, let me show you
something else.

[R & B]

Hey, man, you straight?
Hell, naw, I ain't straight.

Look at my eyes.
They still red?
Yeah, a little bit.

A little bit?
Man, she
fucked you up.

I can't taste nothin'.
My tongue is numb, man.

Why y'all sit and let her
do this shit?

It's your girl.

What's up
with her, man?

She mean as hell.
Man, I met D'wana
about three months ago, right?

She had a little pudge
in her stomach, but I ain't
pay no attention to it.

I thought it came from drinking
forties and shit, 'cause she
had a little beer on her breath.

Come to find out she's
six months pregnant, talkin'
about I'm the baby's dad.

What?
Yeah, yeah.

How you gonna be
the baby's daddy?
Hell, man.

You know she lyin'.

Man, I broke up with D'wana
two Fridays ago.

I got a restraining order
on her, and she don't care
about that or none of that shit.

What?
She got me fuckin' up.

Damn, I broke up with her
two months ago,
two Fridays ago,

and she still...
she don't care about no
restraining order or nothin'.

You all right with them
pants, man?
Man, get out of my business.

How you gonna have
a restraining order, man,
on your girl?

What's up with y'all, man?
Where you meet her?

I was on my way
back to the hood
to buy them twenties.

I mean, them tens.
They tens.

But I keep 'em clean. I was on
my way to buy them, and she had
a Carl's Jr. burger in her hand.

I was standin' there.
I wanted a piece of it
and I stopped.

We got to rappin',
and that's how it happened.

It was the worst day
of my fuckin' life.
Damn.

Psycho, huh?

She must be worse
than Left Eye from T.L.C.
or somethin'.

This fat bitch ain't burnin'.
That ain't the cold part.

She got a little sister named
Baby D'. I'm tellin' you,
this fat bitch get physical.

She sell dope, do hair
and baby-sit out the same house.

Police don't know
when to kick the door in.

I got a restraining order
on her fat ass too.
Wait, wait.

You got a restraining order
on a little girl
named Baby D'?

You don't know Baby D'.
That's why you lookin' at me,
'cause you don't know Baby D'.

Her fat ass be snorin'
and don't even be asleep,
just standin' there.

[Breathing Heavily]

Fat little cupcakes and shit.
This fat bitch know about...

all the new snacks
before they even
hit the street.

All the bootleg snacks,
the year 2000 snacks.

Yeah, gonna tell me
the other day, talkin' 'bout...
[Breathing Heavily]

"Cupcake got a new Twinkie
comin' out next month.

[Breathing Heavily]
"It's a bad motherfucker.

[Breathing Heavily]
"When you bite into it,
cream filling...

shoot all in your mouth,
glitter."

Fat bitch.
Let me get ready
to go to work.

'Cause I'm a player, nigga.
I'm a pimp, and I don't
have to deal with this shit.

You got your shirt on
backwards, player.
Players fuck up.

Snatch the shit
off your head, man.
Don't
worry about what I'm doin'.

Why didn't y'all do nothin'
when the fat bitch
jumped on me?

Y'all a trip! I'm movin'.
I'm runnin' away from here.

Yo, we gotta pull over
or somethin', man.

My fuckin'nuts is hurtin'.
We got some business
to take care of, fool.

Oh, shit. Hey!

Keep your mind
on business, man!

I'm gonna kick
that Craig's butt.

Where we goin' anyway, man?
This shit's...


Damn, Debo.
Fuckin'ass is hurtin'.

What are we doin' here anyway?
Close your mouth,
I'll tell you.

Now, this is the way
the plan goes. I want you
to call over there...

and say you have
an urgent message
from Mr. William Jones.

What urgent message?
The urgent message is,
"Drop everything.

Craig's in trouble.
Come quick."

I don't think that shit
gonna work.
Man, just do it.

I don't even know the number.
It's on the side
of the building, fool.

Just pick the phone up.

Ahh. I feel
five pounds lighter.

What?

Jealous?

What's that?

Come on, now.
Where's my burrito?

What's wrong with you?
What kind of place is this?

[Phone Ringing]
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me my stuff.

Hello? Yeah, I got
an urgent message...
Hello? Yeah.

Mr. Willie Jo...
Willie who?

It's William, fool.
I mean, I got an urgent message

Okay. Jones, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

The urgent message is,
"Drop everything. Craig's

Craig who?
Who's this?
Yeah, nigga!

Just tell him he could...
[Singsong Voice]

[Man On Telephone]
Who is this?

Tell him it's a friend
of the family's.

Yo, man, you gotta stop
hittin' me like that, man.

I'm gonna bust your ass

Knock your fuckin' eye straight.

[Singing
Nonsense Syllables]

Hot sauce, please. Hot sauce.
Thank you very much.
Just a second, man.

Hot sauce. Thank you.
Hey, someone just called...

Give me my money.
[Cash Register Ringing]

Get the fuck outta here!
What you doin', man?

This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever seen
in my life.

Go back in the truck.
What you doin'
outta this truck?

What's going on
around here?

What the hell's happenin'
around here?

[Dogs Barking]

Hey, hey!
Don't take my hot sauce!
Kiss my ass!

This ain't bad, right?
Yeah, it is.

And that scratch
make it real ugly.

Make you not even
wanna drive it.
Okay.

[Door Closes]

Damn.
Who is that?

Who?
Oh, that's they sister.

Hey
[Both] Hey.

Damn, you know what?
I'm beginning to like
Rancho Cucamonga.

Well, don't like it.
Why not?

We need to improve on
black and brown relations.

'Cause there's been tension
between us and them ever
since they got out the pen.

I'm tellin'you, I'm tryin'
to keep it peaceful
around here.

I ain't tryin' to have none of
that gangsta-thug stuff.

We livin'good,
eatin'shrimps and steak.

Hey, hey, man, what you...
Don't do that. Hey.

Let it go.
I'm tellin'you.
Don't mess with her.

[Baby D']
Open the door.

Day-Day ain't here.
Who are you?

I'm his cousin.
Well, we didn't

Yes, you did.
No, we didn't.
We came to buy a C.D.

Yeah, move.
Punk.

These ho's
ain't got no manners.

Mm-hmm.
Where that little boy that
told me Day-Day was in here?

I don't know.
I think he went in the back
to throw away some boxes.

Mm-hmm. Well, can I
look for myself?

No, you cannot.

Hey, ladies.

Where's Day-Day?
I thought y'all wanted
to buy a C.D.

I do. Can you, um, show me
where the jazz section is?

Jazz?

You know damn well you don't

Come on.

Mm-hmm.
I know y'all

If Day-Day come back, tell him
I need to see him,

Fuck you!
Come on, big Baby D'.

D'wana, I don't even like you

Hello. Remember me?
and put a hit out
on this fat bitch.

[Continues, Indistinct]
Hell, yeah,
I remember you.

I'm so sorry about
what my brothers
did to you this morning.

They're... They're just assholes.
Oh, you don't have to
apologize for your brothers.


I wanted
to give you this.

If my brothers weren't
so overprotective, I'd have you
call the house,

but for now, just page me
when you get a chance.

I'll do that.
Better sooner than later.

Yeah?
Yeah.
[Day-Day Chattering]

Shit, it might be tonight.
Get your ass...
Back off, girl!

Baby D', go on
with the bullshit!

[Both Panting]
Now, you ain't gonna catch me
as usual, Baby D'!

Come on, let's make a deal
while we can.
You're not gonna catch me.

What you want, another
Big Pun C.D.? Kelly Price?

Luther Vandross?
Hell, no.

That ain't gonna do?
How about that?

Just like you had in jail...

the wrapper.

You can get to it quick.
Look.

No, your fat ass ain't.

Yeah.
Taste it, Baby D'.
Yeah, that's good!

Eat that...
Your cousin Craig.

That's it?

Just tell him

And I can go free?
Go, before I

What happened?
Made a deal.

All you gotta do is go

What you mean, talk to her?
Go holler at her.
She wanna talk to you.

Talk to me?

Go talk to her.

You gotta come outside

See, I done told you.

Why y'all let her

You don't wanna know.

Thanks a lot, Craig.
Look,

Fat bitches

Too much hot sauce.

Damn, you're sad, Day-Day.
I know how you're

And if I had my bong on me

I got this, though.

What's that green shit

That's chronic, dude! Try it.

I ain't got no bong
or no bullshit brownie,

but, uh, voila.

Whoa.

I'm the one
with the problems.

Shit.
Enjoy, man.

Better open up that window

Don't none of these windows

It's just a theory of mine,
but I think it should work.

[Vacuum Whirring]

Hey, blow.
That ain't gonna work.

Fuck, yeah.

Still gonna smell it.
Uh-uh. Watch.

Man, get back!

I get the point, man.
Stop that bullshit, man!

This vacuum shit

Man, don't grab

Nigga, this is how...

Pinky, they...

I heard about Pinky in...
Where the bathroom at?

Go up to the right.
Man, don't

You gonna burn

Nigga, I was just gonna

You about to burn...

Light an incense

Stanky booty-ass
little boy.

What's up, Roach?
You all right?
You bust your shit?

Don't move.

I'll blow your goddamn head
smooth off.

Now, back up.

Slowly!

Don't say a word.

Hey, man, you...
I said
don't say a word.

Craig went in there
to take a doo-doo.

You ain't seen him
get nothin', uh, to try
to make it fresh.

He ain't do nothin'
to try to make it
fresh in there.

Come on.

Little motherfucker
gonna try to rob me.

Well, I'm gonna show you
how we do it up here
in Pinky's, nigga.

I wasn't tryin'
to rob you...
Shut up!

Before I bust a cap
up in your ass.

Now, what you done done
with Day-Day and Roach?

Day-Day is my peep...
Shut up!

Now, who sent you,
nigga?

Nobody sent me.
Say another
motherfuckin' word,

and this shit

And I ain't playin',
nigga.

Now,

no gun.

[Patting Down]
But where the weed at?

I ain't got no weed.
Shut the fu...
Shut...

Did I say...
Nigga!

Oh, shit!
Say it again!
Say somethin' else!

Oh!
Say somethin' else!

Say somethin' else,
nigga.

I'm gonna tie
your monkey ass up.

Oh, shit!

He been doo-dooin'
for a long time.
When he was a kid,

he doo-dooed in church.

They had to run everybody...
The pastor was the only one...

that could stay in there
through the blessings
of God.

Oh, shit. Oh!

I ain't lyin'.
Craig doo-dooed
in the swimming pool.

We were swimmin' when we
were little one time.
Did
it float up like a submarine?

I was just swimmin',
and I thought it was
a chocolate Payday.

I was swimmin'
like a motherfucker,
and somethin' just said...

[Imitating Gurgling Water]
It kinda hit my...

I got this motherfucker!

No! No! No!

Gonna blow up,
where I make
my money at.

Is he comin'?
Let me tell you
somethin', Roach.

Can I say
somethin' to you?
I love you, man.

Either be smokin'
or be passin', man.


I gotta think of a way to get
this money by tomorrow.
Huh?

I gotta think
of a way to get...
Huh?

I gotta think of a way
to get this money
by tomorrow.

You could sell
your Beemer.
I can do what?

Sell your car.
Sell your mama's car.
I'm not sellin' my...

car for this, man.

Yeah, don't say
nothin' like that.

I know you love that car.
Hell, yeah.

But look, man, I gotta
think of a plan, man.
I hope Craig...

got some kind of plan
while he in there
takin' a shit.

He in there a long time.
Yeah, he in there
a long time.

Let's go clean up, man,
before Pinky gets back.

Ohh!

What's up, baby?
Come on, young blood,
don't kill me, man.

Shut up!

I've been tryin'
to tell your ass
that Day-Day my cousin.

He in the back.
Whatever you say, baby.
Whatever you say.

I swear to God, man.
The combination to the safe
is 34-5-27, man.

Take it all, baby.
It's all yours.
Just don't kill me.

Please, I got kids, man. I got
a motherfuckin' girlfriend,
I got a wife on the side, man.

Shut up!
[Sobbing]

Don't kill me.
Goddamn, don't kill me.

[Sobbing]
Craig, what you doin'?

Nothin'.
Day-Day.

[Day-Day] Huh?
Is this your cousin?

Yeah, that's my cousin.
Good. Then you fired.

Who, me?
Yeah, you.

I'm fired?
And Roach, you fired too.

You fired.
Why you gonna
fire me for, Pinky?

[Pinky]
Shut up! Shut up!
I saw you...

You better keep
your goddamn mouth shut!
Bobby Womack.

Oh, I heard that shit!
Say it again!
Say it again!

Shit.

And you lucky, nigga.
I was just fixin'

Give me back
my motherfuckin' pistol.

Get the fuck up
out of my store.
That's bullshit!

Shut up!
Punk ass.

Tryin' to rob me.
Nigga, I'm Pinky.

Shit, that nigga had me scared,
but I held my own.
Fuck that.

Fat bitch is bustin'
my windows out
all the time.

I knew you shouldn't...
When you goin' home?

[Craig's Voice]
D's sayin'.

In a strange way,
I feel responsible
for Day-Day gettin'fired.

If I wouldn't have
fought Pinky and gave
Day-Day that joint,

he'd still have
a job by now.

Roach too.
That's true.

Got to think of somethin'.

This fat bitch
bust my windows.
Soon as he shut the fuck up.

You ain't even help me.
You sit there and watched her
do the shit, Craig.

And you better quit
hangin' around black people.
You see how we live?

We live wild.
We live rough.
I'm tellin' you.




Damn, Daddy. I didn't know
you had titties.

We got a...
a certified this

Yeah.

And I got

Oh, my head!

Mr. White Man,

What's up there?

Mister, I gotta go help my son.
Let me over.
Please, let me over.

I gotta help myself too.
I got a burning in my stomach.

Oh, my stomach hurts.
Oh, man!
[Siren Wailing]

Officer, please.
Don't just drive past me.

Officer!
Man, how long we gotta ride

Fuck, I don't know.
Shut up, man.

Raise your hand

Ow! Ow!

Man, what we gonna do?

I don't know yet.
Tsk.

I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm goin'home

Sorry about today.
Yeah, me too. Later.

[Day-Day]
I ain't see nothin'.

There must be money or somethin'

Yeah, air.

It's somethin' better

Hey, Cheeco, how's it goin',
boy? Come here. Yeah, boy.
Come on. Ooh. Hey.

What are you doin'?
Get the fuck off me.
How do you know for sure?

It could be any damn thing
in that pump.
I don't know.

It could be anything.
But I say we go over there
and take a look.

I say you go by your damn self.
I'm not fuckin'
with them eses.

Y'all go over there together
and tag team and do that shit.

Now, all we need is
a big-ass pack of bologna.

"Bologna"?

Yeah, bologna.
Want me to get some cheese
and a hot plate?

'Cause we can cook over there
as soon as we get over there.
Get somethin' to eat with...

Man, just go get
the bologna! Hurry up.
Man, shit.

[Car Horn Honks]

Is that a gas station
over there? Oh, here we go.
Yeah, that's a gas station.

[Whining]
Hey, get out of the way, man!

Come on, move!
This fool

I guess I'm gonna have to kill
that little dad of his too
when I get through with Craig.

Hey, man, get out the way!
Get out the way!

Hurry up! You, look.
I got some business
to take care of.

Fuck you, asshole!

Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, me!

Oh, boy. Oh.

I knew I shouldn't have
eaten all that hot sauce.
Oh, boy. Oh. Oh, boy.

Oh, you bad.

Ridin' that magic carpet.
Ain't got to worry

Oh, boy. Oh. Whoo!
Oh, boy. Oh. Oh.

Hi. How are ya?
What are you doin' here?

I'm actually lookin' for

I have to move out of the hood.

The crime is really
gettin' bad.
Yeah, Stan, I got to go.

I wouldn't recommend
that anybody go in there
for at least 35, 45 minutes.

It's smellin' pretty bad.
I don't know what happened.
Get the fuck out of my face!

Oh, Lord! Stanley!
Whoo! Whoo.

Whoo-whoo! Oh.

Oh, you know I do, papi.

Which one, baby?

You and me.
You and me.

I'm nervous, man.

What's the B.G. s?
The bubble guts.

I'm nervous, and I'm about
to shit on myself.

Keep a tight ass, Day-Day.
Try to hold it in or somethin'.
Shut up.

That sound
like butterflies to me.

Butterflies, your ass.
I'm about to go home.

Look. Look.
If we don't go do this,

you ain't gonna have
no home to go to.

Now, all we gotta do is find out
where the little one
put that pump,

take it and see
what's in it.

Dang, you're in
the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take this off.

[Continues]
[Chuckles] Oh, shit.

Go, Flea Biscuit.
Go, Flea Biscuit.

I thought you were gonna
take me to see Mommy.

Uh, as you can see,
I'm a little preoccupied
right now.

I'll take you later.

When? After you're
all drunk and loaded?

I said I'll take
your stupid ass later,
all right?

Get the fuck outta here.
You're ruining my company.


What's this silver thing

What "silver thing"?

Hey, we forgot
to count that shit.

Get up.

Business first.
Hey, Baby Joker.

Come on. Forgot about
the business, ese.

Oh!

Now, Roach, I need you

and Day-Day to take a look.

No, man. Me and dogs

Well, get along

Oh, shit.

Oh, you do, huh?

Good, 'cause that's how
you're gonna get it.


What are you doing?

Huh?
What are you doing here?

Look, I hope you
don't think I'm crazy,

but I snuck in here to show you
that I wasn't scared
of your punk-ass brothers.

And, uh, if you had
a man like me in your life,

you wouldn't have to
be scared of them neither.

What? So you snuck
in my room to tell me that?

Yeah, I did.
Excuse me.
[Lil Joker]
Karla!

Hey, who you talking to?
Nobody.

I heard a vato's voice in here.
No, you didn't.
So get your ass outta my room.

Go back to your stupid
little girlfriends.
I'm tellin'Mom.

Good boy. Feel that?

Good dog. Lay down.

That's a good boy.
Lay down. Yeah.

[Whimpering Continues]
You are a good dog.

Oh, I'm gonna do you good.

Come on.

Hey, I'm cold.

[Window Closing]

Oh, shit.

Motherfuckers

I'm a player.
I'm a player.

Cheeco.

What was I saying?

Oh.

We don't need this shit.
A guy like me
and a dog like you.

We oughta be in Maui,

rentin' Jet Skis
to fat fucks
with flower shirts.


That'd be the good life.

Take you with me
wherever I go, Cheeco.

I love you, Cheeco.

Come on.
Where's Craig?

He's in the house still.

Why'd he go in the house?
Don't worry about it.

We gotta figure out a way to get
him outta there. He probably
gettin' locked up. Come on.

You did all this for me?

Most of it.

I just hate to see
a fine girl like you
in a situation like this.

Thanks for noticing.

It used to be peaceful
around here
before they got out.

They took over the house
and caused my mother's
nervous break down.

Dang. Why she didn't
just kick 'em out?

We tried.

We saved up
to get away from them,
but they just followed us.

Damn. I hate
to hear that.

Can I get out
this window right here?

I thought you came up here
to see me.

I did. It's just,
you know...

Well, what's the hurry?

I got my cousin, Day-Day,
out here waitin' on me.
So what?

Let's make him wait.

Knock.
You want me to knock?

Knock!

You're actin'
like a little bitch
right now, man.

They ain't gonna hear that.
The music's playin'.

Excuse me, partner.
That was a fuckin'
ghetto knock I just did.

I'll show you how to knock
on a door.
What you doin'? Stop.

Yeah. Rub that shit.
[Banging On Door]

Mmm.

[Banging Continues]
Fuckin' shit!

Ruining my flow.

Mmm, right there.
Hey, you lover boys,

Motherfucker,

They gonna think

It gets results.

What the fuck do you want?
We came to borrow some sugar.

Does this look like

Do you see the red dot
on my forehead, my friend?

Do you see an A. T.M.
in the corner
that doesn't work?

Do you? No, you don't.
So fuck you, my friend.

Get the fuck outta here,
Day-Day. You too, Slim Shady.

No problem. We gone.
Hold on a second.

Hey, man, you ran over

I don't appreciate that,
all right?

Uh, that's that bullshit,
man. It ain't...

I got your message.
Where's Craig?

"Message"? I ain't sent you
no damn message.

You didn't call the sandwich
joint with an urgent message?
Hell, no, Willie.

You startin' to think
like a dog.

You leave them fleas and ticks
suckin on your old-ass brain.

Somebody sent me a message.
Where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.

Come on in.

You know you got shit

Hey, don't sit on that couch.
Put some paper down.

Okay, I'll do that.

No, 68.

Yeah, right.
Oh, shit!

This is some bullshit.
We just came over

No problemo. No problem.

Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.

Are you gonna give me a ride

Take your car?
Did I stutter?

Did I stutter?
Hell, no. You ain't... No.

All right.

Oh, thank you.

Two bullets? Boy, your ass

with you. Layin' down there
like a broke-dick dog.

Get up. Come on.
What's wrong with you?

Hey. Damn. That
George Jefferson shit works.
Walk me to the door.

Hey, wait a minute.
Um, I'm gonna sure miss you.

Um, why don't you give
your Auntie Suga some sugar.

Give me a kiss.

[Grunting]
Come here.

Sorry.

Nephew, you're
welcome here anytime.

Thanks again.

Always hittin' on somebody.
Man, you sure
you don't wanna stay?

No, you know I got to live
ghetto fabulous, man.

I can't stay around here
with y'all fools.
Yeah.

It's too crazy around here,
you know.
Yeah, it's thugged out.

But you keep that car.
Make sure you
get that fixed.

Oh, you know that.
I got money now.
Yeah, I'm serious.

When can I come and see you
and fuck your neighbourhood up?
You can't.

Craig!

Fuck his shit up.
Go on, girl.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

Get nigga's shit.
[Laughing Hysterically]

Hurry up. Hurry up.
[Laughing Continues]

[Craig's Voice]
Oh, well.

All's well that ends well,
of course.

Another Friday gone,
another problem solved.

It's a trip to know things
can get wild in the suburbs too.

Man, I can't wait
to get back home...

to the peace and quiet streets
of South Central.

Yeah.
[Hip-Hop]

Yeah, yeah

Get your ass up
and hurry

Ice Cube, baby

Ninety-nine, baby

I'm on the grind, baby

All the time, baby

Show me somethin'
You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

Yeah, I can do it
put your ass into it

Put your back into it
Put your ass into it

Tick-tick, boom
Hear me bangin'down
these back streets

Bumpin'Blackstreet
Treated like an athlete

Life ain't a track meet
It's a marathon

Fuck the cemetery
that a nigga gets buried on

We be clubbin'
till the day we die

Nigga, ask the bartender
if you think we lie

But if you think we high
nigga, think again

'Cuz when it's sink or swim
you gotta think to win

And if I drink this Hen
everybody'll know it

'Cause I ain't goin'for it
so pray to the Lord

That I don't pull out
cuss out and bust out

Go the nigga route
Make the trigger shout

You can try to smoke
an ounce to this

While I pronounce this shit
Baby, bounce them tits

Mama, move them hips
Baby, shake them cheeks

I got dick for days
You got ass for weeks

Don't stop
Get it, get it
That's real

Don't stop
nigga, hit it
I will

I'm gonna do it
gonna do it
Do it, do it

Gonna do it, do it, do it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

Put your back into it
Put your ass into it

Now, all I wanna do
is have fun
with my loved ones

The thug ones, relatives
and my cousins

And I got 'em
by the dozens

When they buzzin'
quick to say
fuck your husband

This is for my niggas
locked away

Extra love for the ones
who ain't got no day

But when we get checkmate
with Ice Cube the Great

Soon as I get a word
we could run for safe

Fuck them licence plates
because life is great

It don't matter if
you're rich and your folks
ain't straight

I'm still comin' with that
underground gangsta shit

No matter how many niggas
say we ain't the shit

Don't stop
Get it, get it
That's real

Don't stop
nigga, hit it
I will

I'm gonna do it
gonna do it
Do it, do it

Gonna do it, do it, do it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

Put you back into it
Put your ass into it

You hard-core rhymin'
hard-time grindin'

Gorilla pimp hoes
while other niggas
wine and dine 'em

Gotta love this thug shit
S-class in the mud shit

Pockets on flood shit
O. G. crip and blood shit

I don't rent, I buy shit
Niggas jealous of my shit

Wonder where this young nigga
get all this fly shit

While ya rootin'
and recruitin'
nigga six eight hoopin'

I was in the hood shootin'
'cause I had
the wife whoopin'

I come from Pyrex gold
and oversized jars

I passed up stripes
I got stars and bars

No time for player hatin'
Mack paper chasin'

Kicked out the substation
to the hip-hop nation

The mo'hits, the mo'bigger
With illegal weight figures

Done developed the status
of a platinum-plus nigga

From the first bad hope
to show I can hit it

I keep pushin', don't quit it
Don't stop till I get it

Don't stop
Get it, get it
That's real

Don't stop
nigga, hit hit
I will

I'm gonna do it
gonna do it
Do it, do it

Gonna do it, do it, do it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

Don't stop
Get it, get it
That's real

Don't stop
nigga, hit it
I will

I'm gonna do it
gonna do it
Do it, do it

Gonna do it, do it, do it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

You can do it
put your back into it

I can do it
put your ass into it

Put your ass into it
