[ Woman ]
I mean, I think about that
if somebody would love me.

'Cause, I mean, that's what
people want, right? They want
to be loved, to be accepted.

And so, you-- I mean--

I don't even know
what to do anymore.

I don't even know if I should
get out of this pool.

* [ Man Vocalizing ]

I have love and,
like, you say, like,

how are you going
to find someone love you?

But, like, I have love
and you don't even want it.

* [ Continues ]

If the world had an engine,
then love would be the coal.

Like, it's like--
It's like
you want to eat food,

and, like, you don't even,
like, get to eat the food
or something like that.

* [ Continues ]

Love is like a taco.
Like, we have to eat tacos.

[ Man ]
* But I'm not so proud of

* The way I behave

* I should have been a jewel

* But I was just a cage

* [ Fades ]

[ Woman ] You do solemnly swer
the testimony you're about
to give in this action...

shall be the truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

[ Man ]
I do.

[ Woman ] State your name,
your full name. Please spell
your last name for the record.

[ Man ]
Charlie Newton.
N-E-W-T-O-N.

Is it possible to move a litte
bit closer to the microphone
so everyone can hear you?

Thank you.

Mr. Newton,
please take a look at
People's Exhibit C, 33-A.

Do you recognize this?
Yes.

Can you describe it
for the court?

It's a DVD R-- Plus R.

And what are the contents
of the DVD R, Plus R?

A film that was made
about me.

And what is the title
of this film?

The Scenesters.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
Down there.
Right down there.

That's where this whole
goddamn mess is gonna end.

The final showdown
of good versus evil,

where the unhinged psychopath
and the man obsessed
with stopping him...

will come face-to-face.

Six weeks ago if you told me
I'd be standing right here,
right now,

I'd have called you a fool.

But I was
a different number then.

I was someone else.

Before you see
how it ends,

you need to know
how it all began.

Let me start
at the beginning.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
Lotus land.

Someone once wrote,
Why should anybody die out here?

They'll never get
any closer to heaven.

Well, I can think of
a couple reasons.

Most think of Los Angeles
as its bastardized acronym: L.A.

They're actually thinking of
a patch we disaffectionately
call the west side--

a place of crowded beaches,
plastic movie stars...

and dog bakeries
with pithy names
like Tailwaggers.

Well, people who think that
are saps...

because that's
only part of the story.

Inland from
the Santa Monica twits
and Beverly Hills fakers...

lies the east side,

a haven for the bohemian,
the eclectic, the scenester.

This is the dive of
a different kind of Angeleno,

of Raymond Chandler
and Dashiell Hammett,

of cholos and gÃƒÂ¼eros,

of swingers and shop girls.

And it's also where
the murders happened.

Wallace Cotten.
C-O-T-T-E-N.

Mr. Cotten,
what was your role on
the film The Scenesters?

Writer-director.

I live on the west side.
I'm not a faker or a twit.

Don't you think
that your opening voice-over
was a bit condescending?

Yes.

Moving on.

Did you
or producer Roger Graham...

ever film your day-to-day
actions during the events
of last fall?

No.

So you didn't hire several
unpaid college interns...

off of a Web site
called Craigslist.org
to run the camera for you?

No.

Interns by the names
of Mandy Jenkins
and Jen Loveworth...

who were instructed to, quote,
"document everything,

because filmmaking itself
is the most fascinating film
of all."

End quote.

I've never said that.

Mr. Cotten,
are you aware...

that this court
has obtained over 400 hours
of this film...

when your residence
was searched by law enforcement?

No, I was not
aware of that.

[ Man ]
Okay, are we ready?
Game time? All right.

Testing, testing, testing.
One, two, one, two.
Rock and roll. Testing.

It's good.
Yeah?
[ Clears Throat ]

Hello and welcome to
Luminescent Ether Productions.

Today we're going to take
a look at our war room.

Now many of you don't know this,
but the war room used to
my wife's craft room,

although the only thing
I ever saw her craft here
was a hangover.

[ Chuckles ]
You're going to have to
excuse the mess.

We had what we call
in the industry a category-five
brainstorm last night.

And that brings us over
to the Big Idea Board.

This is the list of ideas
that we have--

Hey, have you seen
my cameras?

Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
our director Wallace Cotten.

And, Wallace,
please meet our new interns.

This is Mandy. This is Jen.
And this guy here is, uh--

Ted.
Ted?

Wow.
Congratulations.

Now, can I have my cameras
that I paid for with my money?

We are actually shooting
a little video tour
right now,

so we are going to need to
use these for a little bit.

Yeah, I got a---
I got a job, and I need
the cameras now.

You got a what?

Can I talk to you
for a second?
Sure.

All right, a little
producer-director meeting--
pretty common around here.

He cut me off.

Oh, that
son of a bitch.

That's what I
called him.

But, I mean, really, man,
you with a job--

Wow. Now you sound
like him, don't you?

All right, ease up.
What are you
going to be doing?

Freelance videography.

[ Laughs ]
Like weddings and shit?

No, it's with the city.
What city?

Our city. It's with
the police department.

What do the cops
need a videographer for?

Are you wearing
a microphone?

[ Camera Beeps ]

[ Helicopter Hovering ]

Uh, what's this here?
Oh.

[ Wallace ]
Thank you.

[ Police Radio:
Dispatcher, Indistinct ]

[ Conversation,
Indistinct ]

Excuse me. What are you
doing there, McG?

[ Wallace ]
Um--

Oop.

Oh, shit.

Sorry.

What is wrong with you?

Hey, Carlita, quit busting
the new guy's chapas.

Oh, I get it.
I'm the bad guy.

[ Chuckling ]

You guys feel free to break
some of this unimportant shit.

Hey, what's up, man?
I'm Investigator Henry Muse.

Uh, Wallace Cotten.
Cool.

Hey, don't worry
about Travers, okay?

She just doesn't like
you movie people.

She was a law enforcement
adviser on a film...

and apparently
they didn't really
listen to her.

So anyway, the big thing is
we got the dead body
in the bathtub in the back.

So go ahead and get some footage
of that before the coroner
takes it away, all right?

[ Wallace ]
The-- The-- The bo--
The dead body's here?

Yeah, bro.

It's a murder scene,
so it's kind of what
makes it a murder scene.

But, uh, go
check that out, okay?
And I'll see you later.

[ Wallace Mutters ]
Jesus.

[ Hisses ]
[ Wallace ]
Oh, shit! Fuck! Shit!

[ American Accent ]
Thanks, Linda.

I'm standing in front of the
2300 block of Laveta Terrace
in Echo Park...

where police have discovered
the body of a young woman
who appears to have been--

She's not dead!
[ Officers Laughing ]

[ Woman ]
Douche bag!

[ Laughing Continues ]

[ Wallace ]
Oh, it's hilarious.
No, it was really funny.

Look, man, the real body's
back in the bedroom, okay?

But be careful.
She's actually a werewolf.
[ Laughing ]

That's good, man!

[ Chuckling ]

What's so funny?
[ Travers ] Go wait
in the truck, Charlie.

I just saw one outside--

[ Travers ]
We'll let you know
when the crime scene is clear.

Excuse me.

[ Wallace ]
That's a lot of blood, huh?

Is that, like,
a normal amount?

I wasn't aware
that this crime scene video
came with a commentary track.

[ Wallace ]
Sorry.

[ Female Officer ]
T.O.D. between 10:00
and midnight last night.

Cause of death-- multiple
stab wounds to the chest,
most likely from a switchblade.

[ Wallace ]
You can tell it's a switchblade
just from the wound?

No, I can tell
it's a switchblade...

from the switchblade.

[ Wallace ]
Oh.

* [ Stereo: Rock ]

Sorry.
* [ Volume Down ]

Sad, huh?

[ Wallace ]
What?

A young woman
getting murdered.

[ Wallace ]
Oh. Um... yeah, I guess.

Charlie.
Oh.
Wallace.

You, uh, stealing that?

No. It's a C.D.
It was on the nightstand.

There was blood on it.
Just cleaning it off.

It's ironic though.
Le Switch.

You ever heard of them?

Uh, no, I don't really
follow popular music.

Local band
out of Silver Lake.

A little bit of indie rock
mixed in with some soul.

They play at Spaceland a lot.
You ever been to Spaceland?

[ Wallace ]
A couple times, yeah.

They do a free show.
Tomorrow night actually.

Maybe we can grab a beer
if you're interested.

[ Wallace ]
Um, no.

Mr. Newton, where were you
employed when production began
on The Scenesters?

At a company
called Aftershocks.

* [ Bar Tone ]
* [ Theme ]

So now we've talked
about the four basics:

proper uniform,

blood decontamination,

insect removal...

and nausea prevention.

Now let's move on
to step 5: Auxiliaries.

When a violent crime occurs,
there's oftentimes more than
just blood spatter as a result.

You might find
what we call auxiliaries.

The most common
auxiliaries include,
but are not limited to:

brain matter,
skull fragments,

hair, teeth and shell casings.

These items are to be placed
in your standard-issue
biohazard disposal bag.

That's the red one.

Um, sorry.
What's your name again?

Charlie.
Charlie Newton.
Charlie Newton.
I got it. Thank you.

Do you have
any hobbies?

I play guitar.
I'm a musician.

Is that going to take away
from your work here?
No, sir.

All right.
You ever seen
American Psycho?

Yes.
Did you think
it was a comedy?

Maybe a dark comedy.

You get queasy?

I-I don't think so.
All right.

These are
crime scene photos.

How old do you think
this guy is?
[ Clears Throat ]

[ Sighs ]
What are you, a pussy?
Come on. How old?

Fifty.
Thirty-two.

And what about her?

Where's her head?
Where's her head?

Uh, right by her shoe.
Right down there.

She's 22.
She's 15.

And?

She's 20.
Correct.

But it's a he.

See that-- Right--
It's confusing.

It's right by the hot dog,
but that's a penis.

See that?
I can--

Hey, it's me.

Yeah, I need to talk to you
when you have a second.

Yeah.
I'm in the editing studio.

Cool.
[ Phone Beeps ]

[ Monitor: Charlie ]
Silver Lake.
A little bit indie rock--

Why did you call me?
You knew I was--

[ Voices Playing Backward ]
What are you doing, man?

You can't be looking at this.
I'm your producer, man.

I watch your dailies
and I'm a little disappointed.

This is boring.

It's pedestrian.
It's...

Ratner-esque.

I like this Charlie guy though.
I think he's got a good face.

-Yeah, this is for juries.
I don't really think they care.
-Exactly.

Juries today
are more and more populated
by Generation "Y."

You watch music videos.
No.

All right, well, these kids,
they need smash cuts
and harsh lighting...

just to get out of bed
in the morning.

And I mean,
honestly, Wallace,

do you want to be
a Los Angeles crime scene
videographer,

or do you want to be
the Los Angeles
crime scene videographer?

You're right.

The prosecutors
would appreciate it...

if I spruced it up,
if I brought it into the now.

Exactly. This could be
revolutionary.

You could be
the Francois Truffaut
of forensics.

I'll do it.
Next scene I'll do it my way.

Great.

And we are coming
with ya.

What?

[ American Accent ]
Thanks, Paul.

I'm standing near the Metroplx
Condominiums downtown...

where earlier tonight
police discovered the body
of Kimberly Rockwell,

the victim of what appears to
have been a tragic accident...

involving an over-the-counter
insect pesticide
much like this one.

These are available
at any corner drugstore...

and are of course more
commonly known as bug bombs.

Now, if you've ever used one f
these devices you'll know that
after you remove the tab...

you're instructed to leave your
residence for a length of time,

due to the poisonous chemicals
released into the air.

It appears Ms. Rockwell did not
follow the proper directions...

and the results were lethal.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
Kimberly Rockwell, scenester.

This tomato was fresh
off the boat from Indiana,

seeking out L.A.
as an indie rock journalist.

Little did she know
the closest she'd get
to the papers...

was her obituary,

and no one would read it.

[ Police Radio Squawking:
Indistinct Voices ]
[ Chattering ]

Mandy? Are you gonna
throw up again?

[ Door Closes ]
[ Laughing ]

What?
I'm just saying, man.

No self-respecting groupie
wants to go to the show
to bang the drummer.

Dude, whatever.

But Stewart Copeland
is a genius, all right?

Hey, cotton picker,
your producer here
is my kind of asshole.

I know.

Actually, Investigator Muse
has been pretty cool.

He's going to let us stay after
they close down the crime scene
and shoot some pickups.

Really?
Yeah.

Yeah. You guys feel free.
Head over to the fridge.

When I was processing it
I noticed some beer in there.
Go at it.

I would love to join you,
but I gotta get to
band practice.

[ Falsetto ]
Speaking of which-- my demo.
Ah.

I don't know if you guys
ever need any music for
your projects or whatnot,

but give it a listen.

"Chokehold."

* [ Guitar, Violin ]

* [ Guitar, Drums Join In ]

* So you say

* Things just
aren't working out *

* This apartment's
as small as my heart *

* And you've just
got to break free *

Yeah, it was me and
a few other officers. I write
most of the songs though.

Would you play often?

Yeah, pretty often.

First we were just doing
cop fund-raisers,

but then we got a residency
at the Black Echo on Sunset--
second Tuesday of every month.

You guys should come check it
out after the trial's over.
We go on around 10:00.

Would the jury please
disregard Investigator Muse's
solicitation?

Actually
it's a little more new wave
than any of that.

I just think a microphone
and a gun is so on point.

Hey, I hate to interrupt this
Empire Records staff meeting,

but could we talk about
the body for a second?

Oh, yeah. Hey, uh, Travers,
what's the haps
on the dead chick?

Investigator Travers.
Been looking to meet you.

I'm Wallace's
producer.

That's my card.

What does "G.F.Y." mean?

Go fuck yourself.
[ Laughing ]

He did the same thing to me.
[ Laughing ]

Just a little producer joke.
Let's keep that.

Awesome.

Well, it appears
she has a contusion
on the back of her head here.

So it seems pretty obvious.

She set up the bug bomb.

In a rush to get out,
she fell, hit her head,
knocked herself out...

and sucked in some poison
for a few hours.

[ Wallace ]
On what?

What?

She hit her head
on what?

A plush couch?

[ Charlie Narrating ]
Some cultures believe that
a photograph captures the sou,

that celluloid can somehow
seize the immaterial essence
that makes us who we are.

I wonder if--

* [ Dramatic ]

It's a shame.

Chick was a real piece of ass
before she got on
the old ghost train.

Excuse me, bro.

Um--

What are you doing?

I'm sure ol' Kim here would
want us to honor her memory
by firing up a video game.

Hey, guys.
* [ Music Stops ]

[ Video Game Noises Stop ]
Did the investigators
notice this?

Notice what?

This CD.

The rest of the CD's
on the rack are in alphabetical
order except for this one,

which is out of place
and upside down.

Um, if there's no little
plastic number next to it,

then they didn't think
it was important.

Huh. Maybe I should
give them a call.

Dude, some girl misfiled a CD.
I would chill out.

It's just that at the last crime
scene next to the woman that
was stabbed with a switchblade,

there was a CD
from a band
called Le Switch,

and this CD is from a band
called Airborne Toxic Event,
which is how she died.

Are you saying
that this crime scene...

and the other crime scene
are connected?

No, I'm not saying that.

It's probably
just a coincidence.

That's weird.

It's not a CD. It's a DVD,
and it says "Play Me."

We should
definitely give them--
Let's take a look at this.

[ DVD Player Clicks ]
* [ Rock ]

What ya doin' over
there?

N-Nothing.
Just, uh, puttin' on some tunes.

You're putting on the band
we just saw.
You're that guy.

I have to.

It's my... seduction music.

Ooh, sexy.

You're turning me on.
Admit it.
you can't resist this.

[ Both Laughing ]
I can't.

How much is it
going to cost me?
More than you can afford.

Oh, I think I can
find a way to pay you.

Oh?
[ Beeping ]

What was that?
What was what?

[ Beeping ]

What the fuck, Brian?

Come on!
Get out now.
Let me just get my camera.

Now! Get the fuck
out of here!

[ Arguing Continues ]

[ Woman ] I will scream
at the top of my lungs!
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

* Oh, and your friends
say what is it *

* You look like
you've seen a ghost *

Oh, my God.

A serial killer.

The east side
hasn't seen a serial killer
since the Night Stalker.

Man, the cops
didn't find this.
You did.

You should win
something.

I don't think
they give out prizes.
Well, they should.

I mean,
you should make them.

I mean, apparently
you're a lot smarter
than these C.S.I. guys.

You should totally call
them up and tell them...

that you have information
on the murder...

and you're only going
to give it to them
if they give you $50,000.

That sounds
like a really bad idea.
I should give them--

You're pretty perceptive,
aren't you?

What?

You notice little details
that other people don't.

Yeah, I guess.

Really, I just
watch a lot of those
crime scene TV shows.

Fancy yourself
an armchair detective?
Always looking for clues?

Sure.

Can I talk to you
for a second?

Uh, yeah, sure.

Did you see that 9/11
documentary that was on TV
a couple months ago?

The one with
Robert De Niro?
Yeah, it was amazing.

Okay, the French guys
who made it,
these two French brothers,

they were doing
this documentary about
New York City firefighters.

All of a sudden, there they are,
they catch the 767
fly into the towers. Okay?

So they go in the towers,
they get this amazing footage.

Suddenly, their little movie
about firefighters...

turns into this worldwide event
seen by people everywhere...

and they
become famous overnight.

Yeah,
they hit the jackpot.

That is our 767.

And that's how
The Scenesters was born.

Right then and there.
Hmm.

You do realize that conspiring
to withhold evidence...

and interfering
with a police investigation
are both felonies.

No, I did not.

Are you serious?

Why would you want to make
a documentary about me?

Because you're fascinating.

An average schlub with
a Sherlockian sensibility
of deduction.

Schlub?
It's Yiddish.

I can examine who you are
as a person,

how seeing death
on a firsthand basis...

and matching wits
with a serial killer
affects you.

How does it affect me?

Well, indignation mostly--

at the system
for not being able to put
this guy behind bars,

at yourself for not being
able to stop the rampage,

at God for creating
such a beast.

That's a lot to feel.

Charlie, this could be
the high point of your life.

I mean, people
all over the world,

from Berlin
to Venice to Toronto,

would get to know
the real you.

Hmm.

Charlie Newton,
documentary film star.

I like the sound of that.

And if you catch the killer
before the cops do, you're not
gonna hear me complaining.

Me catch him?

Look, I'm just a normal guy
with too many channels
and an overactive imagination.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
I was just a normal guy...

with too many channels
and an overactive imagination.

I was a working stiff,

a corporate stooge
who pulled a 9-to-5 in order
to put dinner on the table...

and a deck of butts
on the dash.

Who was I to think
I could catch this monster?

Atwater Village,
just east of the L.A. River.

Not too far from here
was the site of
the Night Stalker's first pre.

On June 28, 1984,

Richard Ramirez
broke into the house
of a 79-year-old woman,

stabbed her to death
and then--

Okay.

What do we know...

about this killer?

Well, he's probably
a white male in his 40s.
Okay.

We need to put the brakes
on the whole racist train
right now.

Well, it's statistics.
Ninety percent of all recorded
serial killers are white males.

Okay, white male.

What else?

Since both murders happened
within a few miles of each other
here on the east side,

it'd be a good guess that
he lives or works around here.

Eastsider.
What else?

Both victims
were young blondes,

so he may have some bad
past experience with a blonde,

maybe some sort of
Oedipus complex.

Is that that thing where you
want to fuck your own mom?

Yeah.

[ Chuckles ]
This serial killer is fucked up.

Uh, I think
it's spelled O-D.
It's O-E-D.

Okay, wants to fuck Mom.

What else?
Well, he's chosen to
make CD's the connection.

Maybe he has an association
with music, is in a band
or was in a band.

Really? Okay, let me
recap here, Charlie.

White guy,
lives on the east side,
into blondes, likes music.

Okay, you just described
every single person I know.

Every single person you know
wants to fuck their mom?

[ Chuckling ]
[ Charlie Chuckling ]

Well, look,
there's only been two murders.

Maybe if there were
a couple more I'd come up
with something better.

And if I know
this serial killer,
there will be more.

[ American Accent ]
Thanks, Peter.

I'm standing on the northeast
side of Griffith Park...

where the body of an
unidentified Caucasian female...

was found this morning
by a jogger out for a run.

I'm here
with the jogger now,
a Mr. Irving Shaw.

Mr. Shaw, can you tell us
exactly what happened?

[ Stammering ]
Well, I was training
for the L.A. Marathon,

which used to start downtown
but now it's in the valley,
which is really--

The body, Mr. Shaw.
Just tell us
about the body.

Right.
Um, f-freakiest thing.

So I'm coming down the trail
and I see, like, these pair
of chicken legs...

at the end of a tunnel.

And-- Not literally
chicken legs, of course,

but, like, a woman whose legs
are, like, real skinny.

[ Police Radio:
Dispatcher, Indistinct ]

[ Sirens Blaring ]
[ Helicopter Hovering ]

Hmm.

What do we got?

Uh, what we've got is
a shitty shot composition.
Can I move her hair?

Customarily the first step
in preserving the crime scene
is preserving the crime scene.

Yo, Graham Cracker,
Cotton Picker.
What's shakin', boys?

[ Roger ]
Same old shit.
Right on, man.

Hey, did you have a chance
to listen to my band's demo?

What happened to her?
Well,

it appears that she was
strangled to death.

Because of bruising.

No, because of
the guitar string
wrapped around her neck.

* [ Humming Notes ]

Could you stop doing that,
please?

[ Charlie Narrating ]
Griffith J. Griffith,

the millionaire developer
who owned this land back
when it was an ostrich farm.

On September 3, 1903,

Griffith shot his wife
in the face...

but, unfortunately for him,
didn't kill her.

After serving two whole years
in San Quentin for the crime,

he offered to build the city
an observatory as repentance.

But it turned him down.

It didn't want
his philanthropic blood money.

Ten years after he died,

when he left the money
in his will,

Los Angeles changed its mind.

How quickly this town
forgives the sinners.

How quickly our misdeeds
fade into the dust.

Well, I'm like an elephant.

I never forget.

She was unlike the others.

This didn't appear
to be the crime scene,
just the dump site.

But what was so different
about this girl?

Maybe the dirt would tell me.

Maybe not.

A tat.

I'd seen it before.
But where?

Might as well be
a question mark.

It wasn't that bad.

Yes, it was.

Would it kill people
to find bodies
during magic hour?

I feel like we're on the face
of the fucking sun.
Check it out.

Looks like our boy's
got a crush.

[ Roger ] Maybe a potential
love interest for our film?
[ Wallace ] Ugh. No.

It's irrelevant to the plot.
Fleshes Charlie's
character out.

Dude, if he had a wife or
a girlfriend he was neglecting
I might go for it,

but I really don't feel
like starting a relationship
from scratch.

It might be out of
your control. Looks like
they're hittin' it off.

I doubt that.

She's harder
to get into
than Skybar.

Skybar? What are you,
a time traveler from 1987?

I'm Jewell's cameraman,
Hume Wonacott.

And trust me, at every live
stand-up Jewell does the weirdos
come out of the woodwork.

I swear, she must get,
like, three or four
marriage proposals a week.

[ Laughs ]
This one guy--

Mandy, is Charlie
still wearing his mike?
Yeah, hold on.

[ Charlie ]
People that just-- just--
Oh. Oh.

Yeah, the course only
lasts about three days.

[ British Accent ]
I thought you guys were
supposed to wear gas masks.

Only when
the health inspector's
around.

[ Chuckles ]

Do you like it?

I don't think it's a job
you really like.

I think it's one you more
tolerate till payday.
Oh, it's good money then.

Yeah.
Great money.

I wouldn't think it'd be
so hard to find someone
to clean up blood.

See, I-- I would think that,
'cause, you know, it's blood.

[ Laughs ]
True.

Um, I'd better
go find my cameraman.

So--
Yeah.

It's good
to see you again.
Yeah.

You too.

Hume?

Was my mike on?
Were you guys listening
to my conversation?

Uh-huh.
You said it was good
to see her "again."

You know her?

Yeah, I know her.

We dated for two years.

[ Charlie ]
Here we go.

All right,
here we are at Big Bear.

Big Bear
for the big one year.

We are surrounded by trees.

Ah, the wilderness.

And those leaves are obviously
from the trees.

And there's the tent
that I put up all by myself
in the dark last night.

Let's see if Sleeping Beauty
is stirring.

Hold on.

Let me get that.

And there she is.

Wakey, wakey,
eggs and bakey.
[ Grumbling ]

It's cold.
Come on.
It's time to get up.

We're on vacation.
I want to sleep late.

This is no vacation.
This is an anniversary trip.

We've got things--
Mmm.

We've got things
to "anniverserate" here.
[ Laughs ]

[ Laughing, Groaning ]

Okay.
All right.

I'm up. I'm up.

There you go.

What are we doing then?
It's a surprise.
Get your boots on.

Okay.
[ Groans ]

What time is it?
It's 5:30 or so.

I hate you.
Oh, yeah?

I love you too.

Now let's move.
Okay.

You look really good
in the morning.

Shut up.
[ Charlie Chuckles ]

Are you rolling?
Okay, just do it again.

Why do I have to
do it again?
Because the camera was not on.

So you want me to come back
in again and act like I'm
doing it for the first time?

No, I want you to come in and
tell us again, coincidentally
in front of the camera,

which is now on.

Well, doesn't
a documentary--
Charlie!

Hey, guys,
something just clicked.

What?
You remember the tattoo on
the girl in Griffith Park?

Yeah.

I knew I'd seen it before,
but I couldn't remember where.

It might as well have been
a question mark.
And then it hit me.

What is that?
It's the demo CD
Investigator Muse gave you.

He gave me the same one, too,
when I first met him.
Did you ever listen to it?

Yeah, it was
actually not bad.

So what does this mean?

What do you think
it means?

That Muse is the killer?

[ Knocking ]

[ Wallace ]
Which one's Muse?

[ Charlie ]
He's the one with the--
Oh.

[ Wallace ]
What do you call that?
Soul patch.

[ Wallace ]
Soul patch.
Soul patch.

Is that ironic, or--
[ Charlie ]
No.

[ Wallace ]
Well, it doesn't
really work for him.

[ Wallace ]
Who was that?
I don't know.

There was no one there.
Left this though.

That, um--

That was awesome.

His composition's
amazing.

He's like
the Janusz Kaminski
of serial killers.

That was
the most disturbing thing
I've ever seen.

I guess you've never seen
my ex-wife's art.

You think this is funny?

These women are being murdered,
all right?

Murdered.

And aren't you guys
the least bit concerned...

that this guy knows
exactly where you live?

Well, look, he only
kills women, all right?
So let's not lose focus.

Charlie, were there
any clues in this video?

Oh, other than the fact
that you were completely wrong
about Investigator Muse?

I never said Muse
was the killer.

Oh, no, you just
stared at us dramatically.

Excuse me
for misinterpreting.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
They say a picture
is worth a thousand words.

How many words
is 24 frames a second?
* [ Rock: Drums, Loud ]

What game was he playing?
[ Monitor: Woman ]
Can I help you?

Was there something
he wanted me to see?

Or was what he wanted me to se
was that there was
nothing to see at all?

There.

[ Audio: Two Thumps ]

[ Doors Slamming ]

Not one door closing,
but two in quick succession.

[ Doors Slamming ]
The killer drove a van.

[ Doors Slamming ]

I was wrong.

The killer wasn't a cop.

The killer went to that show
to toy with the cops,
to shove it in their face.

So you had no idea
this murder...

was occurring
only feet away?

No.
No, I didn't.

I know it's no excuse,
but my guard was down.

[ Sighs ]
I was intoxicated.

You'd been consuming alcohol.

No.
No, nothing like that.

[ Sighs ]
From the stage.

From being up there.

From feeling it.

I-I don't understand.

Have you ever been in a band?
Uh, no.

Then you can't understand.

[ American Accent ]
Thanks, Gene.

I'm standing inside
Secret Headquarters,

a comic book shop
in the Sunset Junction area...

where around 4:00 this morning
someone broke in and
vandalized the establishment.

With me is Dave Pifer,
the shop's owner.

Dave, can you tell me
what happened?

When I showed up
this morning,

somebody had kicked down
the door and knocked over
a whole rack of back issues.

So they didn't
steal anything.

Oh, no.
Thank the Lord.

And this is news?

I just think this is
a complete waste of time.

Your character
needs a love life.

Would you stop referring to me
as a character?
Look, guys--

Are you still, uh, shooting?

You guys making
a documentary or something?
Or something.

Our boy Charlie here is
about to make another trip
up the Jewell of the Nile.

[ Laughs ]
Good luck.

Lord knows I've tried.

Well, we have a history.

Okay, sure you do.
You and everyone else
who watches her at 11:00.

All right.
Time to launch.

Come on. Come on.
Get over there.

Hey, Jewell.
[ British Accent ]
Charlie.

What are you
doing here?

You know, just--
It was really good
to see you the other day.

Um, thanks.

So what are you doing here?

I know it's been
a lot of years and...

a lot of things
have happened, but...

I just thought it'd be nice
to, you know, grab lunch
or something sometime.

No big deal or anything.
Just-- Just to catch up.

Charlie...

this is just
a bit strange.

You know?

I mean...
I thought you...

hated me.

Why would you say that?

Because you wouldn't
call me back
for two months.

Look, I went through
a phase there,

but I'm better now.

Just trying to be
a bigger man.

Thought it would be nice
just to sit down and talk.

It could be nice.

Great.

I'm going to need to get
your number again though,

'cause I deleted it.

Who edited all this footage
together by the way?
It's terrible.

A court-appointed editor.

Wow.
Sounds prestigious.

Back to my question,
Mr. Cotten.

Were you aware
that your producer
Roger Graham...

was pushing the relationship
between Mr. Newton
and Ms. Wright?

No. And had I been,
I would've put a stop to it.

Why is that?
Because I was making...

the greatest Los Angeles
crime saga of our times,

not Sleepless
in Silver Lake.

I had bigger fish to fry.

Hi. This is Wallace Cotten,
director of The Scenesters,

and you are watching
the DVD bonus extra
on the art of editing.

Editing has long been--
[ Phone Ringing ]

[ Ringing Continues ]
Not gonna answer itself.

Luminescent Ether
Productions.

It's the killer.

Killer?
Our killer?

That's what he says.
On the phone now. Great.
Put him on speaker.

Should be good.

[ Dial Tone ]
What'd you do there, Jen?

I pressed the button.
No, you hung up,
then pressed the button.

You have to press the button
and then hang up. Have you
ever worked an office job--

[ Phone Rings ]
Hello? Killer?

[ Processed Voice ]
This is the Soloist.

Um, what can I do for you?

I see you at the crime scenes
and I know what you're doing.

You're making a film
about me.

You were--
I saw y--

Sorry.
I saw you.

You were
at the crime scenes?

I saw you and that cleanup boy
making a documentary.

I thought that
perhaps I could help.

Can you hold on
for a second?

[ Wallace ]
Help with what?

[ Wallace ]
Charlie.

[ Wallace ]
Y-Yeah, the old one
or the new one?

[ Charlie Narrating ]
The old zoo. Midnight.

Someone out there
was ribbing me up.

The note had been slipped
under the door of my apartmen.

But by whom?
A witness?

A snitch?

Perhaps the killer himself
trying to lure me into a trap.

The old zoo,

a little-known
archaeological find
of the east side.

It opened up shop in 1913...

and was abandoned for good
almost 50 years ago
due to neglect.

Some say it's haunted.

I was here to find out.

The old zookeeper station.

Seeing that this is where
the trail came to an end.

Or perhaps this is
where it really began.

[ Roars ]
Ah!

[ Roaring ]
[ Grunting ]

[ Jukebox: Rock ]
* No one else around

* And if I've
learned anything at all *

* You sure are not mine

Hey, bro,
I paid for that beer,

so if you're not
gonna drink it, then I will.

That was some serious shit
back there, man.

I mean, that was--
that was a rush.

I haven't felt like that
since I shoplifted
in high school.

I knew you'd love this--

the adventure,
the danger, the romance.

Romance?

You didn't forget
about your date tomorrow?
It's not a date.

It's just lunch.

Have you even thought about
where you're gonna take her?

I've been
a little bit preoccupied.

You're gonna start
with a nice meal at El Compadre,

and then you're gonna
stroll down Sunset on
the south side of the street...

to that gelato place.

You're gonna buy her
some gelato and then make
your way down to Echo Park,

when you're gonna walk
on the east side of the lake.

It's where my wife and I
used to go every Sunday.

You were
really married, huh?

Yes, indeed.
Sentenced to three years.

If you don't mind me asking,
what happened?

She died.

I'm sorry.

I'm kidding. She left me.

Well, to answer
your question,

I-- I played
for a little bit,

and then one
of the strings broke,

and I just didn't bother
to replace it.

[ British Accent ] Well,
you should. I always thought
you were really talented.

And truly, I wasn't
just saying that
'cause I was your girlfriend.

Well-- Well, that's--
that's good to know.

How long has it been
since you last played?

October 5, 2000.

Are you serious?

You may
or may not know it,

but that-- that night
sucks pretty bad for me.

But I had a lot
of bad associations.

I don't do Irish
car bombs anymore either.

[ Laughs ]
Sorry for laughing.

No, it's okay.
It was a joke.

The desired outcome
is laughter.

Charlie.

I'm really sorry.
I said it was okay.

No. Um,
about that night.

Oh.

I wanted
to tell you so badly
how... shitty I felt,

but you wouldn't
call me back
and... it really sucked.

I mean, the whole
situation sucked.

And I know you
probably have
this image in your head...

of me and some other guy
on a beach somewhere
laughing at you.

But in actuality,
I just did a lot of crying.

A lot of crying.

Why did you and Jewell Wright
end your previous relationship?

Does that matter?
Why does that matter?

Your Honor, I would like
to admit exhibit 3445-K
into record.

It's amateur footage
taken at the Tangier music club.

* And I still believe
in a love so true *

* And now, baby,
I'm wonderin' *

* Do you believe too

[ Woman ]
Whoo!
[ Cheering ]

Hey, thanks a lot, guys.
I appreciate it.
Thanks for coming out tonight.

I got
one last song for you,

but, uh, first
I wanna do something
a little bit unconventional.

My girlfriend Jewell
is here tonight.
[ Cheering ]

She's been really supportive
of everything I do...

and really just
the greatest girl in the world.

And I'd like her
to come up here for a minute
if she would.

[ Woman ]
Aw!
[ Man ] Yeah!

This next song's
for you, babe.

But first, there's something
I've been wantin' to ask you.

[ Scattered Aws ]
[ Man ]
Oh, my God.

Jewell Wright,
will you marry me?

Well, we can talk
about something else now
if you want.

Yeah, yeah.
That-- That would be good.

So how about that
Iraq war resolution, huh?

Think we'll ever invade?

Nah, that'd just
be a cluster fuck.
Yeah.

You hear about
the beltway snipers
getting arrested?

Yeah. It's crazy, right?

Father and son
just picking people off.

At least our serial killer
gives his victims a chance.

What serial killer?

Shit.

Nothing.
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

I can't tell you,
Jewell.

These three women,
they're possibly connected,
aren't they?

Charlie.

All right.

It has to stay
between us.

Of course.
I promise.

[ American Accent ]
Insiders have now confirmed the
murders were indeed connected,

dubbing the killer
the Soloist.

Investigators were forced
to confront the issue
this morning...

when I, Jewell Wright,
blew the lid off the secret.

We're doing
everything we can
to catch this guy, okay?

Law enforcement
has known this whole time that
the two murders were connected.

[ Reporters Talking At Once ]

We didn't wanna cause a panic.
Young, beautiful, blond women
should feel safe...

to walk our streets at night.
We didn't want
a repeat of 1992.

This is Los Angeles,
not Detroit.

Do you have
any suspects?
No, not at this time.

We're not allowed to comment
on an ongoing investigation.
Any leads at all?

There's going to be
a Night Out Against Crime
fund-raiser tonight...

at the Black Echo on Sunset,
featuring music
by Chokehold.

[ Reporters Clamoring ]

It remains to be seen
how successful
investigators will be.

But this much is true.

A reign of terror
is sweeping over
the east side.

No one is safe.

This is Jewell Wright,
KSVU News.

So now the cat
was out of the bag.

Yes. And serendipitously,
a great point
in the film actually.

I mean, the whole city
gripped with terror,

not knowing where to turn
or who to trust.

It really amped the scope
of the project.

And then the second tape came.
Yes, the, um, Halloween party.

What did you think of that?
Oh, vast improvement
over the first tape.

It was way creepier.

* [ Funk ]

[ Chattering, Laughing ]

[ Man #1 ]
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

Happy Halloween,
my babies! Whoo!

[ Man #2 ]
Yeah! Show 'em
your dance, dude!

[ Women ]
Yeah!
[ Man #1 ] Ten more bucks.

One more time.
[ Woman ]
Show us!

[ Partyers Laughing ]

Whoo!

Oh, no!
Do the dance!

Do it!
Do it.

Yeah!

Do a bit more.

Whoo! Rock out
with the cock out!

This is Silver Lake,
bitches!

[ Women Chattering ]

That's the one that you said.
Yeah, that's the one
that I guessed.

"I'm So Wasted"
is definitely the best one.

You are so fucking wrong.

You're telling me "T Rex"
is better than "I'm So Wasted"?

[ Robot ] What are you
bitches talking about?
What Wallpaper track is better?

Easy. "T Rex."
What? You're wasted.
Both of you are wasted.

I can't believe
that you're even
my friend.

Everyone knows that song
just wasn't even--

Okay, get a fucking
room, sluts.

* [ Continues ]

[ Door Closes ]

Oh, hey, man.

You got any blow?

Sweet.

Take a seat.

What's with the camera?

Hmm?

Okay.

Oh. Do you?

No?

Okay.

[ Inhales ]

What happened?

Well, I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say
the witch is fucking dead.

Well, if he killed her,
then why haven't--
[ Cell Phone Rings ]

Hello.

Did you notice when he
was writing the message?
Mm-mmm.

He used his left hand.

You ever do cocaine?

No.
It's fucking awesome.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
The nose candy the killer
had given the frail...

was actually rat poison--
hydroxythiacoumarin.

A lethal dose
right up the beezer.

One need not be a chamber
to be haunted.

One need not be a house.

The brain has corridors
surpassing material place.

Was that good?

I don't know if "good"
would be the word.

I don't get it.
So the band the dead girl's
talking about...

is called Wallpaper.

So why didn't the killer,
like, wallpaper her
to death?

It's the money.
What?

She snorted the rat poison
through a rolled-up bill.

Wallpaper's drug slang
for money.

How the fuck
do you know that?

I read... books.

[ Chattering ]

Oh, look at this.
Ho-ho!

This can't be good.

Cotton Picker. Graham Cracker.
What's shakin', boys?
Yeah.

What is this?

They're
our camera crew.

Um, no,
we're your camera crew.
[ Muse ] Um, no.

You guys are
crime scene videographers.
These men are artists.

Yeah. They're
from Denmark.
[ Danish Accent ] Hello.

Hello.
Mm-hmm.

Jesus Christ.

There's gonna be
following us around
during this whole Soloist thing.

Department's giving them
full access to everything.
[ Travers ] Mm-hmm.

Even the interrogation rooms.
Interrogation rooms.

Wow. Hear that, Roger?
Full access to everything,
even interrogation rooms.

Wow. Well, I should
give you guys
my business card.

Oh, here-- Will you--
Give me that.
There you go, Franz.

G.F.Y.?

[ Franz Speaking Danish ]

[ Danish Continues ]

Talk me through it, Muse.

[ Danish ]

Girl's at the party
having a good time.

Comes here
to the back bedroom.

Why?

She just found out
from her friends...

that her boyfriend's
cheating on her.
I'm with you.

Killer comes in here
through the window.

Her boyfriend.
Obviously.

She knew him, because otherwise
she would've hightailed it
out of there...

like a cockroach
when the lights come on.

Boyfriend tries
to make nice.
But she's not having any of it.

Ah, but she is
at first.

Says he'll never do it again.
Says he'll never
see Debbie again.

Who's Debbie?
Exactly.
Who is Debbie?

Because her friend said
that he cheated on her
with Jeannie.

You get around, killer.

Boyfriend...
[ Gasps ]

pushes her down
to the bed.

He pulls out
the rat poison.
Yes.

And bam,
shoves it up her nose.
Ah!

Yeah. Whoo!
Did it again.

Yes, he does.
One more time,
does it again.

F'in-A.
Does it again.

[ British Accent ]
How's it going?

I don't know if I should
tell you. I might hear
about it on the news.

Look, I didn't reveal
anything you told me.

I saw the broadcast, Jewell.

He called me.

Who did?
The Soloist.

Bullshit.
I know it sounds crazy.

But when I got home
from our date,
he called me at home.

He told me all about himself.
He had this weird
voice-altering thing.

Why would he call you?

Because I'm a reporter.

Well, if he was
gonna call a reporter,
why wouldn't he call one that--

It's--

Look, it's the truth.
You can take it or leave it.

I'll fuckin' leave it.

Is there
a problem here, Jewell?

No. There's
no problem at all.

Listen, a word
of advice, dude:

she is so not
the same person
she is on TV.

[ Laughs ]

So you didn't believe her?

I wanted to,

but I just couldn't.

And nothing important happened
plot-wise for a few weeks?

Yeah.
The Soloist kept killing.

We continued to investigate,

and Jewell and I continued
to have pretty intense,

you know, sexual tension.

Wallace said it would
be the perfect time
for a montage.

* [ Drums ]

[ Man ]
* Whoa, baby

* You're driving me crazy

* I said baby

* You're driving me crazy

* Oh, well, you turn me on

* Then you shut me down

* Oh, well, tell me, baby

* Am I just your clown

* Psycho

* Oh

* Whoa, baby

* You're driving me crazy

* I said I'm losing my mind

* You treat me so unkind

* Psycho

* Whoa

I liked that song.
Never heard it before.

Shocker.

At this point,
you were contacted
by the Soloist again, correct?

No.

Really?

You didn't meet with him
at Spiderhouse Coffee
on Vermont Avenue...

at 4:17 p.m.,
Monday, November 18, 2002?

Spiderhouse has
surveillance cameras,
doesn't it?

It sure does.

Boo.

Do I know you?

It's me.

The Soloist.

You fuckin' with me?

No, man.
It's me, the one and only.

Prove it.

All right.

So how's your boy Charlie doing
after the ass-whuppin'
I gave him at the zoo?

You're black.

Yeah, I guess.

What's up?

Look, this whole
murder spree thing's...

getting a little stale,
you know.

I thought maybe you'd
like to take things
to the next level.

I'm so relieved
to hear you say that.

I mean, don't get me wrong.
We've got a ton
of great footage-- a ton.

But where
is this going?

Exactly.
We need some momentum.

Ticking clock.
You mean like a bomb.

Do you have a bomb?
No.

Well, it doesn't literally
need to be a ticking clock--

just something
to kick in some urgency
for the third act.

Well, what would
you have me do?

Well, I wouldn't
have you do anything.

This is a documentary.
But I can throw out ideas.

What kind of ideas?

[ Wallace ] The Soloist opens
the closet to reveal victim
number 15 bound and gagged.

He removes the gag.
Ready to die?
[ Coughing ]

Please don't kill me.
Please!

I have a family.

Death is your new family.
Soloist stabs the victim.

Ah!

Uh, is that
how you really scream
in real life?

Uh-- Um, I-I don't know.

I guess.
Never been stabbed before.

Aah!

Good. That was good.

Um, do you mind
if we do a little improv?

Yeah. Sure.
I've taken classes.

Give me one reason
I shouldn't rip
your fucking heart out.

Um--
[ Laughing ]

[ Screams, Sobs ]

Well, I gotta tell you, Clare,
I think you're the best
we've seen all day.

I think we just found
our new victim.
Thanks.

If-- If I get it, do you know
when you guys might need me?

Uh, we're not
really sure yet actually,

so, uh, we might
just surprise you.

While Wallace
might call this
a bullshit studio note,

I think that
a strong protagonist
needs a clear arc.

An arc?

Uh, personal development.

Starts off normal yet flawed,
finds success,
falls from grace...

and then seeks redemption
in the third act.

Mmm. So you needed
Charlie Newton
to fall from grace.

By any means necessary.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
I was dizzy for the dish,

and she broke my heart
not once, but twice.

Her affections were as fake
as that American accent.

Love never dies
a natural death.

It dies because we don't know
how to replenish its source.

It dies of blindness
and errors and betrayals.

It dies of illness and wounds.

It dies of weariness,

of witherings,

of tarnishings.

[ Groans ]

Oh, God.

Why did I have to drink
real whiskey?

[ Roger ]
'Cause you're a big boy.

Now let's pull it together.
We gotta get out of here.

[ Groans ]
Let's go.

Where are we going?
We're going
to meet Jewell.

Oh, that's not
a smart idea.

Yeah, it is, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

All right.
Come on, trouper.

Help me up.
There you go.
Come on.

Oh, no!

Jewell!

[ Pounding ]
Jewell, open the door!

Charlie. What's up, bro?

What the fuck
are you doing here?

I'm just hanging out
with my friend Jewell.
What are you doing?

Friends?
Yeah.

Friends, huh?
Yeah.

Hey, man!
What is your problem?

You need to relax.
Calm it down.
Just calm it down!

What the fuck, guys?

Just wait inside, Henry.

[ Door Slides Shut ]

What are you
doing here, Charlie?

You wanna talk about
what sucks, Jewell?

That night you shot me down
onstage, that sucked.

That sucks real bad.

But when you used me--

used me for information
after all that we've
been through--

that just hurt, Jewell,
hurt more than you'll know.

But you need to know--
you need to know
how bad it hurts...

so the next guy
maybe doesn't get it so bad.

Are you drunk?
[ Scoffs ]

It took you that long
in this conversation
to ask me that?

Now I know
I've done a lot to you--

and you can
feel free to call me
a whole slew of names--

but liar is not
one of them.

I did not get
the information from you.
I got it from the Soloist.

Really?
Really?
How many times--

You're still sticking
with that story?

After all this time,
you didn't have the decency
to come up with a better one?

[ Scoffs ]
You have a good night,
Charlie.

What, that's it?

That's all you got?
I can take it.
Come on.

King Kong ain't
got nothing on me!

Let's go.

[ Woman Crying ]

[ Crying Continues ]

[ Crying ]

Don't blush,
my sweet.

It's time to add
a little terror
to those cheeks.

[ Wallace ]
Cut. Are you kidding me?

I thought you said--
No, no.
Clare, you were great.

Irving,
are you kidding me?
What?

I don't know
how to tell you this,
but you're really bad.

Bad at what?

This, okay? This.
Whatever it is you're doing.

You-- You told me
not to act because
this is a documentary.

What?
I'm just
being myself.

Yeah, well,
you're terrible
at being yourself. Okay?

And, honestly,
I'm a little concerned.
[ Door Opens ]

[ Door Closes ]

Thought you were
shooting pickups.

We wrapped early.
What's going on here?

We're rehearsing.
Clare.

[ Charlie ]
Where have I
seen you before?

People say I look
like a young
Larry Fishburne.

No.

You hang out
at the crime scenes.

I've seen you
at a bunch of the crime scenes.

What's behind your back?

Nothing.

[ Roger ]
Hey, hey, Charlie.
Charlie, Charlie, ease up.

This is the killer?

The killer I've been hunting
is in the war room?

Wait. What?

How long have you two
been chattin' it up, Wallace?

Couple of weeks.

And you don't think
you need to tell
your producer about it?

Oh, like you tell me
everything, Roger?

You don't think I don't know
about you shoving Jewell
down his throat?

What?
I'm not shoving anything.

Oh, really?
Hey, step one
of filmmaking.

Take the tape
out of the camera
when you're finished.

Gelato?
Fucking gelato?
Hey!

Did he sign a waiver?

What?

A release waiver.
Did he sign one
to be in the movie?

No. Not yet.

[ Charlie ]
Could you get him
to sign one now?

Okay.

I signed mine.
[ Wallace ]
Yes, I know. Thank you.

It's standard.
Standard.

The killer's left-handed.
Now turn the fucking camera off.

[ Laughs ]
Yeah, right.

So you lied.
Yeah, I lied.

I'm an actor
looking for a good role.

So sue me.

And you came up
with the name the Soloist?

I thought it had
kind of a nice ring to it.

Uh, I hear...

you know who is kind
of pissed off about it, but--

So what happened
when Charles Newton found out
that you were a hoax...

and that Mr. Graham
and Mr. Cotten
had been manipulating him?

[ Chuckles ]
He was pissed.
I mean, pissed.

[ Roger ] All right,
this is life, Charlie.
You can't quit on life.

I've done it before.
You signed a contract.

Consider this a breach.
Charlie, if you just
thought about--

Stop it.
Just-- Just stop it.

No more manipulation.
No more smooth producer talk.

I'm tired of people
screwing me around.
I'm taking a stand, all right?

I'm taking a goddamn stand
for once in my life.

[ Roger ] Well, there
goes our third act.
Thanks a lot.

Oh, it's my fault.

Yes, it's
your fucking fault.

You didn't think to do
a background check
on your fucking psychopath...

while you're busy
manipulating the facts?
[ Engine Starts ]

You know, I guess I forgot.
And you didn't seem to notice...

when you were off playing
"When Charlie Met Jewell"...

to compensate for your
fucked-up obsession
with Jeannie.

Okay, you leave
Jeannie out of this.

I think it's too late.
I think Jeannie left on her own.

[ Yelling ]

[ Wallace ]
You did not.
You did not. You did not.

I did, bitch!

This is a $300 jacket.

[ Roger ] All your shit's
fucking lame and pretentious.

I fucking wanna make
real movies.

Maybe you shouldn't cheat
on your wife. Huh?

I was trying to sleep
with the distributor
at Miramax.

[ Thud ]
[ Woman Screams, Muffled ]

[ Muffled Screaming ]
[ Thudding ]

[ Muffled Screaming Continue ]
[ Thudding Continues ]

[ Yelling ]

[ Wallace ]
You did not.
You did not. You did not.

[ Muffled Screaming
Continues ]
I did, bitch!

This is a $300 jacket.

[ Roger ] All your shit's
fucking lame and pretentious.

I fucking wanna make
real movies.
[ Thudding ]

Maybe you shouldn't cheat
on your wife. Huh?

[ Engine Starts ]
[ Muffled Screams ]

* [ Car Stereo: Rock ]

[ Charlie ]
Jewell Wright,
investigative reporter.

More like
investigative bitch.

[ George ]
Oh, man, come on.

I love that Jewell Wright.
She's smokin' hot.

Way hotter than that
Laura Ortega chick from KZAY.
Way hotter.

Yeah, I'll give you that.

We used to go out.

I was in love with her.

You shittin' me?
No. No, I'm not
shittin' you.

We were good together too.

Really good together.
The best.

Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

What happened?

Did you fuck up?

No. She cheated on me.
She cheated.

With a career.

Korean?

[ Laughs ]
No.

Career.
Career.

Career.
Sorry, man.
You're-- You're slurrin'.

That's what
a woman does though--

puts work
ahead of family.

Isn't it true?

It's true.
I'll toast to that.

I'll tell you
one thing though.

This whole serial killer thing
has done wonders
for that career.

What do you mean?
Face time, man.

Nobody even knew
who Jewell Wright was...

before the Soloist
came to town.

Now she's like
Lois fuckin' Lane.

Yeah.

You're absolutely right.

You're absolutely right.

* [ Car Stereo: Rock ]

[ Heavy Breathing ]

Jewell. Jewell.

Muse. Muse.

Muse. You all right, buddy?

Muse.

We got some help on the way.

Jewell?

Jewell?

[ Door Closes ]
Jewell.

Jewell?

Jewell.

Jewell?

Jewell.
[ Heavy Breathing ]

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

That's all you got?
I can take it.

King Kong ain't
got nothing on me!

Is he gone?
Yeah.

You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

* [ Guitar ]
[ Heavy Breathing ]

* There are places
that I know *

* There are places
I won't go *

* There's people
that I've met *

* There's some
that I regret *

* There's a million things
I've done *

* One in a million
of them were fun *

* There's miles of road
to drive at night *

* But that doesn't
make it right *

* What's the point
of going back *

* When you can't--

[ Heavy Breathing ]

[ Shower Running ]

[ Jewell Gasps ]

It's you.
[ Screams ]

I mean,

what did you expect?

You really thought
killing 14 women
would impress me?

I mean,

you thought--
Read it!

He's got me, Charlie.

He wants you
to finish the film.

Come at sunrise
or it'll be your loss,

to the place
where the red would cross.

Charlie, if I don't
see you again,

I should've said yes.

What does he mean
by finish the film?

The final conflict--

good versus evil.

This won't be over
until the unhinged
psychopath...

and the man obsessed
with stopping him
come face-to-face.

Let's make one thing clear.

I think you guys are scum.

Below scum.

But if I gotta finish
this piece-of-shit film
to save Jewell--

Let's not judge the movie.
Shut the fuck up!

I'm talking.

If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this my way.

All right?

I'm a producer on this film now.

An executive
fucking producer.

Got it?

Good.

Let's shoot a finale.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
A place where
the red would cross.

I knew instantly
he wasn't talking about
a communist or an Irishman.

He wasn't talking
about a Joe at all,

but the one thing
that most represented the
downfall of old Los Angeles--

the final undoing
of the east side.

The red car line,

an efficient
and cheap streetcar system...

that ran all over town
until the 1950s...

when the big three automakers
pressured the city
into shutting it down...

to make way for their
highways and gas-guzzlers.

This is where
the red car used to cross
the Los Angeles River.

Nothing but a bunch
of pylons now,

giant slabs of concrete
that sum up what was...

and what will never be again.

"Follow the river north
and up you'll look...

when you reach
the bridge at Sunnynook.

Well, I think that about
brings us up to speed.

[ Sirens Blaring ]

[ Charlie ]
You okay, Jewell?

Hello, Hume.

[ Helicopter Whirring ]
[ Sirens Blaring ]

Who's that?
I think it's
the cameraman.

Why would her cameraman--
Because he's
in love with Jewell...

and he always has been.

He knew her dream
was to become
an investigative reporter.

He wanted to see her
rise to the top.

He wanted to see her
grab the city's attention.

What better story
for her to cover
than a serial killer, right?

You kill her,
and these cops are gonna
plug you something fierce.

Oh, I'm counting on it.

Then the whole world
will see me fall...

and they'll know
I did it for love.

These cameras
will tell my story.

This film
you've been making...

will show the world
what really happened.

And it'll be up to the viewers
to choose who was right
or who was wrong,

if I was crazy,

brilliant.

The audience will decide.

[ Jewell Crying ]

No, they won't.

Excuse me?

You push her,

and I'll
personally make sure
that every piece of tape...

that has documented
this entire event
is destroyed.

Incinerated.
What?

You heard me.

Every single shot
from every camera...

will disappear
into thin air,

and no one
will ever even know
Hume Wonacott's name.

You can't do that.

You just watch me,

except you won't
be able to because
you'll be fucking dead.

If you step away now,

I'll let them
finish this movie.

I'll let the whole world
see what you've done
up on the big screen.

[ Whimpering ]

[ Travers ]
Down! Down on the ground!
Hands on your head right now!

Hands on your head right now!

You're okay.
You're all right.

Uh, Mr. Wonacott,
would you please stand
and face the jury...

as the verdict is read?

Mr. Foreman?

[ Foreman ] The Superior Court
of California,
County of Los Angeles...

in the matter
of The People of the State
of California...

versus Hume Edward Wonacott,
case number VD67778.

We the jury in the above
entitled action...

find the defendant
Hume Edward Wonacott guilty...

[ Spectators Murmuring ]
on 14 counts of the crime
of murder in the first degree...

in violation
of penal code 187A,
a felony.

[ Charlie Narrating ]
It was all over.

I had caught the bad guy
and the city would sleep safe-

at least until the next villan
came knocking at its door.

But the big mystery
still remained.

Would it ever work between us?

[ Jewell ]
All right, are we ready? Ready?
[ Charlie ] Yeah.

Say hello. Hello.
I'm ready.
I'm driving as well. Hello.

Oh, can we go
to the Liberace Museum?
It's right by our hotel.

Oh, I don't know.
I've actually been,
like, 15 times already.

How about
the Elvis museum?

Who?
Elvis Presley.

[ Laughs ]
I'm surprised you know
who that guy is.

Oh, here we go.

[ Jewell ]
Oh!
There they are.

[ Charlie ]
Hey, boys. Smile.

[ Jewell Laughing ]

Classic.

[ Charlie ]
Have we seen enough?

[ Jewell ]
Yeah, I guess so.
[ Charlie ] All right.

[ Jewell ]
That's so funny.

[ Charlie ]
All right, you guys take care.
[ Jewell ] Bye!

[ Horn Honking ]

[ Jewell ]
Here we go.
The trip begins.

* In a crowded bar
your ringer tones
grab my mind *

* I can see you through
the phone, the phone,
the phone *

* And I'm wide awake at home
at home, at home *

* So they all see
my coquette *

* And hope you don't catch

* The bourbon on my breath
my breath, my breath *

* Catch a cab
outside on Seventh Street *

* And the cars fly by
through the Bowery *

* I come to your door
and I hear a moan *

* Then another voice
So, Christ, she's not alone
alone, alone *

* And my heart sinks like
a stone, a stone, a stone *

* And the tears
won't even come *

* I feel so numb

* So swept aside, so dumb
so dumb, so dumb *

* When the words are wrong
and my patience gone *

* Will you tell me
Does this mean
you're moving on *

* From the balcony
you call my name *

Your face so wet *

* Said I broke your heart
but it hasn't happened yet *

* I'll bet your friends
all hate me now *

* I get the strangest looks
from that bitchy crowd *

* And though they must think
they have every reason to *

* I guess I'm still
not quite yet over you *

* When the words are wrong
and you're hanging on *

* Another guy's arm

* Does this mean
you're moving on *

I didn't like it *

* Though I can't even
start to fight it *

* It's true

* It's true

* It's true
