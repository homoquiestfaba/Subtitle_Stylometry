I MUST ADMIT,
IÂ´M STUMPED, MR. SIPES.

ITÂ´S AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION
FOR A FATHER TO MAKE.

WELL, YOUÂ´RE IN CHARGE
OF MARKET RESEARCH.

TEST THEM BOTH
AND LET THE CONSUMERS DECIDE.

BUT, GILBERT,
YOU PROMISED TO HELP ME.

HOW CAN YOU EVEN ASK ME
TO COMPETE WITH A PIG?

-IT WAS YOUR FATHERÂ´S IDEA.
-OH.

NO.

THATÂ´S RIGHT! YOU DID!

I KNOW YOUÂ´RE TRYING TO TELL ME
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

WHY CANÂ´T I UNDERSTAND?

<i>BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, HANKY.</i>

STAFF, YOU ALL KNOW
MY DAUGHTER, JESSICA,

AND MY FUTURE SON-IN-LAW,
GILBERT SIPES,

OUR DIRECTOR
OF PUBLIC RELATIONS.

GENTLEMEN.

IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT
OF FRIENDLY COMPETITION,

IÂ´VE INVITED HANKY
AND HIS LITTLE FRIEND GORDY

TO HEAR THE RESULTS.

OF COURSE. I JUST HOPE THEYÂ´RE
NOT TOO DISAPPOINTED.

OUR CONSUMER-RESEARCH DIRECTOR,
MR. BRINKS, HAS BEEN WAITING

TO GIVE US A FULL REPORT
ON THE MARKET TEST.

NO CONTEST, MR. ROYCE.

SEE WHAT I TOLD YOU?

IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS,

DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES
ARE WEIGHED

ACCORDING
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS --

SKIP THE GOBBLEDYGOOK,
MR. BRINKS.

WHICH BRAND
DID THE PUBLIC CHOOSE?

HERO PIG OUTSOLD THE COMPETITION
100 TO 1.

[ CROWD GASPS ]
WOW.

BUT JESSICA HAD TO WIN.

IÂ´M SORRY, MY DEAR.

PEOPLE JUST CANÂ´T RESIST
A BABY ANIMAL.

LOOK, THEREÂ´S BEEN A MISTAKE.

LETÂ´S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE RESULTS --

COMPARE THE TV COMMERCIALS.

LETÂ´S ROLL JESSICAÂ´S TEST.

[ SNORTING ]

[ GASPING ]

[ LAUGHTER ]

WHAT HAPPENED?

YOU. YOU RUINED MY CAREER.

STOP THE TEST!
STOP THE TEST!

STOP THE TAPE!

STOP.

SHEÂ´S REALLY NOT THAT FAT.

I DEMAND A RETEST.

SORRY, SIPES.
THE PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN.

WEÂ´LL SIGN GORDY
TO A LIFETIME CONTRACT.

WELL, YOU THINK
HE LOOKS CUTE NOW,

BUT HEÂ´LL GROW INTO A HOG
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

YOU THINK THOSE PICTURES
OF JESSICA LOOKED FAT?

WEÂ´RE TALKING LARD CITY.

I REGRET TO SAY THIS, SIPES,

BUT MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
IS SHAKEN.

FROM NOW ON, IÂ´LL SUPERVISE

GORDYÂ´S PUBLICITY BUILDUP
PERSONALLY.

WE FOUND OUR NEW IMAGE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

FROM NOW ON,
HERO PIG BRANDS IS US.

[ SQUEALING ]
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

[ GROANS ]

<i>AND THATÂ´S WHY HEÂ´S
THE WORLDÂ´S FAVORITE PIG.</i>

<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LETÂ´S HEAR IT FOR GORDY.</i>

<i>[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]</i>

HERO PIG BRANDS
IS A BIG WINNER, HANKY.

SALES HAVE TRIPLED, AND PROFITS
HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF.

IÂ´M PROUD OF YOU, PROUD
OF THIS LITTLE FELLER, TOO.

[ SNORTING ]

WEÂ´VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU
A FAVOR, GRANDPA.

ITÂ´S ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

THEYÂ´RE LOST,
AND HEÂ´S WORRIED SICK.

AND HE WANTS DESPERATELY
TO GO LOOK FOR THEM.

I LOVE YOU, GORDY!

[ SNORTS ]

GORDY WANTS TO GO?

NO. WELL, HE CANÂ´T.

HEÂ´S BECOMING
A NATIONAL INSTITUTION.

PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN GORDY
TO THEIR HEARTS.

TELL HIM I ONLY WANT
TO DO WHATÂ´S RIGHT.

HE DOESNÂ´T WANT TO LET
ANYONE DOWN, GRANDPA.

HE ONLY WANTS TO DO
WHATÂ´S RIGHT.

SO ITÂ´S ALL SETTLED.
WEÂ´LL SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT.

[ MUSIC STOPS ]

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

SICKENING.

HERO PIG LABEL PUTS OUT ONE CD,
AND IT GOES PLATINUM?

HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR IT?

HEÂ´S LOVEABLE.

[ SCOFFS ]
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

MY JOB IS CONSUMER RESEARCH.

I AM TELLING YOU WHY HE SELLS.

HE GIVES PEOPLE HOPE.

IF A PIG CAN MAKE IT,
ANYONE CAN.

TO THINK I HELPED DISCOVER
THE LITTLE WEENIE.

AND I WAS RIGHT
ON THE VERGE OF TAKING OVER --

HANKY, JESSICA, ROYCE,
THE WHOLE COMPANY.

WELL, HEÂ´S NOT GONNA STAND
IN MY WAY.

HERO PIG HAS GOT TO GO.

WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

KIDNAP GORDY.

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

THIS IS DIETZ.

I HAVE HANKY AND GORDY
IN THE BACK.

-WeÂ´re going to the park.
-PERFECT.

IÂ´LL HAVE KRUGMAN
COME TO JOIN YOU.

YOU MANAGE THE KID
WHILE HE SNATCHES THE PIG.

OKAY, BOSS.

<i>BUT WEÂ´RE NOT RUNNING AWAY.</i>

WHEN YOUR FAMILYÂ´S IN DANGER,
YOUÂ´VE GOT NO CHOICE.

BESIDES, AS SOON AS WE FIND
THEM, WE CAN COME BACK.

<i>BUT FINDING MY FOLKS
IS MY PROBLEM, HANKY.</i>

ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

[ SNORTS ]

-DIETZ. -OH, MAN.
[ BELL RINGING ]

CALL SIPES.
TELL HIM WE LOST THEM.

[ GROANS ]

HERE, PIGGY, PIGGY, PIGGY,

BETTER NOT. HEÂ´LL FIRE US.

YEAH. BETTER NOT.

IÂ´LL COVER THE PARK.
YOU DRIVE AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

-RIGHT.
-HERE, PIGGY, PIGGY.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

THAT SCHOOL BUS --
ITÂ´S GETTING READY TO LEAVE.

I DONÂ´T THINK PIGS
ARE ALLOWED AS PASSENGERS.

HEY, DIETZ!

-ITÂ´S OUR ONLY CHANCE.
-[ SNORTS ]

HEY, IÂ´VE GOT AN IDEA.

-WAIT HERE IN THE BUSHES.
-[ GRUNTS ]

<i>THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
OUT OF THE PARK.</i>

NOW WEÂ´RE IN BUSINESS.

JUST WAIT HERE TILL THEY SHOW --
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ]

ITÂ´S THE BOSS.

DIETZ, THIS IS BRINKS.
WHATÂ´S GOING ON?

MR. SIPES
IS WAITING FOR A REPORT.

UH, YES, SIR.

UH, WELL, TELL HIM
THAT WEÂ´RE --

WeÂ´re still at the park and
the situation is under control.

WHATÂ´S YOUR PROBLEM, DIETZ?

E-EVERYTHINGÂ´S FINE, SIR.

HERE, YOU CAN ASK KRUGMAN.

No, I donÂ´t want
to talk to Krugman.

Dietz. Dietz.

UM, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
MR. SIPES.

ALL LOCKED UP
IN THE TRUNK OF THE LIMO.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALL?

YOU HAVENÂ´T SNATCHED HANKY,
HAVE YOU?

WE HAD TO, SIR.
HE WOULDNÂ´T LET GO OF THE PIG.

[ BOTH GROAN ]

OF ALL THE STUPID...

ALL RIGHT.

I WANT YOU TO KEEP HIM
UNDER WRAPS,

AND I WANT YOU
TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.

YES, SIR.
[ Receiver clicks ]

[ Dial tone ]

GET IN, GORDY.
THEY WONÂ´T LET US IN THE BUS.

BUT I WONÂ´T BE ABLE TO BREATHE.

DONÂ´T WORRY.
WEÂ´RE ALMOST THERE.

I KNOW I HAD THE PARK COVERED.

IÂ´M TELLING YOU,
THEYÂ´LL COME OUT THIS WAY.

THOSE TWO KIDS IN THE BACK --
ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE A PIG.

-ITÂ´S THEM!
-ITÂ´S THEM!

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

THOSE IDIOTS. THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO GRAB THE PIG.

KIDNAPPING IS
A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

OF COURSE.

THROW DIETZ AND KRUGMAN
TO THE FEDS.

YES, BUT FOR NOW,
THEYÂ´VE GOT THE PIG.

INTERSTATE 64 WEST?

WEÂ´RE ABOUT TO CROSS
THE STATE LINE.

BACK OF THE BUS SAYS...
KANSAS CITY.

THEYÂ´RE STILL FOLLOWING US.

THEN WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

THEYÂ´LL GRAB US
AS SOON AS WE GET OFF.

I DONÂ´T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

BUT IÂ´M GETTING
KIND OF...SCARED.

DONÂ´T WORRY, HANKY.
WEÂ´LL FIND A WAY.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

-MOM, IÂ´M SCARED.
-WHERE ARE WE?

-ITÂ´S ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN.
-GET UP, NOW.

IÂ´M REALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR DINNER, SIR.

BUT IÂ´VE LOST MY FAMILY.

I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THEM.

HOW WOULD I KNOW?

-[ CHUCKLES ]
-YOUÂ´D KNOW MY MOTHER.

SHEÂ´S A BEAUTIFUL YORKSHIRE.

AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS
ARE MY AGE,

GIVE OR TAKE A FEW MINUTES.

YEAH, COME TO THINK OF IT,

I DID SEE
A FINE-LOOKING YORKSHIRE LADY

AT THE TRI-STATE AUCTION RING
A FEW DAYS AGO.

SHE WAS WEARING A BLUE RIBBON,

AND I THINK SHE HAD
FIVE KIDS WITH HER.

FIVE?! ITÂ´S THEM!
WHERE CAN I FIND THEM?

THEREÂ´S NO TELLING, KID.

THEY AUCTIONED THEM OFF AND
SHIPPED THEM SOMEWHERE UP NORTH.

NORTH? THATÂ´S WHERE PIGS
DONÂ´T COME BACK FROM!

YEP. THATÂ´S WHAT THEY SAY.

WELL, I SURE DO THANK YOU, SIR.

HOPE YOU FIND THEM IN TIME, KID.

-COME ON, GORDY.
-THANKS AGAIN.

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

BUT I CANÂ´T HELP WONDERING,
HOW FAR IS NORTH?

ALL I KNOW IS
ITÂ´S A LONG WAY ON FOOT.

WHAT WE NEED IS A MIRACLE.

WHATÂ´S A MIRACLE?

ITÂ´S WHAT YOU PRAY FOR
WHEN YOU NEED HELP.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

EXCUSE ME, FOLKS.

HELLO. THIS IS COUSIN JAKE.

Hey, there, Cousin Jake.

This is the President calling
from the Oval Office.

Hey, Hillary and I heard about
Gordy Day there in Branson,

and we want to join
in the celebrations.

Y-YES, SIR, MR. PRESIDENT.

JUST A MINUTE.
GORDYÂ´S RIGHT HERE.

[ SNORTING ]

IÂ´M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.
HEÂ´S SPEAKING PIGGY TALK.

I understand him fine, Jake.

By the way, Gordy,
we have a surprise for you.

On behalf
of the American people,

it gives me great pleasure
to unveil in your honor

your very own postage stamp.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

GORDY SAYS ITÂ´S AN HONOR,
MR. PRESIDENT.

THANK YOU, SIR.

The First Lady joins me

in saying good luck, God bless,
and so long for now.

SO LONG, MR. PRESIDENT.

[ SQUEALS ]

AT THIS TIME, GORDY WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE HIS PERSONAL APPEAL.

HEÂ´S LOST HIS FOLKS,

SO IF ANYONE HAS SEEN A PIG
FAMILY THAT LOOKS LIKE HIM,

PLEASE CALL
OUR TOLL-FREE NUMBER.

AND NOW HEREÂ´S LUKE McALLISTER
AND THE ROADHOUSE GANG!

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ SLOW COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ]

â™ª WHEN WE MET â™ª

â™ª I TOLD HER
IÂ´D GIVE HER THE MOON â™ª

â™ª AND I DID ON A SILVER SPOON â™ª

â™ª IF IÂ´D ONLY KNOWN â™ª

â™ª THE PROMISE
I KEPT WOULD BE WRONG â™ª

[ SNORTING ]

â™ª WELL, SHE MIGHT NOT BE GONE â™ª

â™ª NOW ITÂ´S EASY TO SEE â™ª

â™ª THE ONLY THING
SHE NEEDED FROM ME â™ª

â™ª WAS MORE LOVE â™ª

â™ª MORE TIME â™ª

â™ª MORE OF HER KNOWING
THAT SHEÂ´S ON MY MIND â™ª

â™ª MORE OF MY HEART
WOULD HAVE SUITED HER FINE â™ª

â™ª Â´CAUSE THATÂ´S
WHAT SHE WAS DREAMING OF â™ª

ISNÂ´T IT TIME FOR US
TO GO BACKSTAGE?

â™ª SHE ONLY NEEDED MORE LOVE â™ª

WE CANÂ´T LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE
OF LUKEÂ´S SONG.

WHY? YOUÂ´VE HEARD ONE HILLBILLY,
YOUÂ´VE HEARD THEM ALL.

â™ª SHE TRIED â™ª

LETÂ´S STAY A WHILE.

I THINK IÂ´M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH COUNTRY MUSIC.

â™ª BUT I DIDNÂ´T LISTEN
BACK THEN â™ª

â™ª OH, MY GOD â™ª

â™ª IT TOOK HER SAYING GOODBYE â™ª

ITÂ´S BEEN A BIG NIGHT.
I NEED TO CATCH MY BREATH.

IÂ´LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

SEE YOU.

â™ª IF MY PRAYERS CAME TRUE â™ª

â™ª I KNOW JUST WHAT IÂ´D DO â™ª

-â™ª SHE NEEDED MORE LOVE â™ª
-[ SQUEALING ]

-â™ª MORE TIME â™ª
-GOT -- GOT HIM!

â™ª LESS OF THE THINGS
THAT MONEY CAN BUY â™ª

GET THE DOOR, DIETZ!

â™ª MORE OF MY ARMS
JUST HOLDING HER TIGHT â™ª

â™ª WHEN IT ALL ADDS UP
TO THE BOTTOM LINE â™ª

-[ SQUEALING ]
-SHUT UP.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

â™ª SHE ONLY NEEDED MORE LOVE â™ª

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ LAUGHTER ]

-THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT
TO MARKET. -[ SQUEALING ]

THIS LITTLE PIGGY STAYED HOME.

AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY, UM...

-HAD ROAST BEEF.
-...HAD ROAST BEEF.

THIS LITTLE PIGGY HAD NONE.

AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT...

-"WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE."
-"WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE..."

ALL THE WAY HOME.

[ LAUGHTER ]

HUH?

THEREÂ´S A BRIDGE.
LETÂ´S THROW HIM IN THE RIVER.

WHAT RIVER?
JUST SOME TREES DOWN THERE.

ITÂ´S CLOSE ENOUGH.

COME ON,
LETÂ´S GET IT OVER WITH.

[ SQUEALING ]

HAVE A NICE TRIP.

[ GASPS ]

[ SQUEALING ]

[ LAUGHTER ]

-WHOO!
-WHOO!

OH, GORDY,
YOUÂ´RE ALIVE AND KICKING.

BLESS YOUR LITTLE HEART.

THEYÂ´RE LEAVING.

LETÂ´S GET OUT OF HERE.

WATCH YOUR BACKS.
COMING THROUGH.

DONÂ´T WORRY, HANKY.
WEÂ´LL FIND HIM.

IÂ´M TELLING YOU,
HEÂ´S RUN AWAY.

HOW DO YOU KNOW?

-GORDY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
-HANKÂ´S RIGHT.

<i>HANKYÂ´S WRONG,
AND ITÂ´S ABOUT TIME HE WOKE UP.</i>

-YOUR MOTHER AGREES WITH ME.
-I DO NOT AGREE.

FORGET GORDY.
HEÂ´S HISTORY.

LOOK WHO I JUST FOUND.

-[ SNORTING ] -HERE
YOU GO. -GORDY!

THERE, YOU SEE? YOU WERE WRONG.

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

WHERE WAS HE?

I WAS UP ON THE RIVER RIDGE
ROAD, RIGHT WHERE THE ROAD FORKS.

TALK ABOUT YOUR NINE LIVES.
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

WELL, YOUÂ´RE SAFE.
THATÂ´S ALL THAT COUNTS.

-IÂ´M -- IÂ´M --
-PHONE CALL FOR COUSIN JAKE.

EXCUSE ME.

THANK YOU.
HELLO. THIS IS COUSIN JAKE.

Hey, I was watching
your telethon program.

You tell Gordy
IÂ´ve got an idea

as to where he might look
for his folks.

GORDYÂ´S RIGHT HERE.
LISTEN TO THIS, EVERYBODY.

WHAT IS IT, COUSIN JAKE?

Well, I delivered a load
of Meadow Brook farm pigs

up to the fattening yards
in Broken Bow.

MEADOW BROOK FARM?!
ITÂ´S GOT TO BE THEM!

Could be.

Most of those pigs
get hauled off

to that big slaughterhouse
in Omaha.

Sure hope you get them in time.
See you, Cousin Jake.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU KINDLY, MAÂ´AM.

WAIT.

I REMEMBER YOUR GRANDPA
ONCE TOLD ME

THAT WE OWN A PROCESSING PLANT
IN OMAHA!

YOU MEAN A SAUSAGE FACTORY?

I THINK YOUÂ´RE MISTAKEN,
JESSICA.

THERE IS NO SUCH PLANT.

MR. BRINKS HAS
THE INVENTORY SHEET. SHOW THEM.

WHAT ABOUT THIS?

[ GASPS ] NO!

ROYCE PROCESSING PLANT,
6 COLFAX STREET, OMAHA!

-[ SQUEALS ]
-[ GASPS ]

[ GASPS ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HANKYÂ´S INHERITANCE.

YOU DONÂ´T HAVE TO BE
SO GRABBY, MR. SNIPES.

GO PLAY YOUR BANJO, GOOBER!

BANJO? GOOBER?

EASY, LUKE.

-GOOBER?!
-EASY, LUKE. WHAT THE --

WHY DIDNÂ´T YOU SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BEFORE?

WHY SHOULD I?
IT WAS AN EXECUTIVE DECISION.

I DONÂ´T HAVE TO ACCOUNT --

YOU DONÂ´T HAVE TO RAISE
YOUR VOICE

IN FRONT OF THE YOUNG ONES.

KEEP OUT OF THIS,
YOU IGNORANT HAYSEED.

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

UGH!

[ GROANS ]

[ CHUCKLES ]

I THINK WE MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

THANK YOU FOR STEPPING IN.

BRINKS!

[ GASPS ]

THANKS FOR THE USE
OF YOUR BRIEFCASE.

MOM, WEÂ´VE GOT TO GET MOVING!

-COME ON!
-WEÂ´LL TAKE THE LIMO.

LOOKS LIKE THE END OF THE LINE
FOR THESE PIGS.

YEAH.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

YOUÂ´VE GOT TO CLOSE THE FACTORY
BEFORE ITÂ´S TOO LATE.

DONÂ´T WORRY, GORDY.

[ Telephone ringing ]
ITÂ´S RINGING!

WeÂ´re not here at the moment,

IMMEDIATELY.

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

LETÂ´S HOPE THEY CHECK
THEIR MESSAGES.

[ GULPS ]

LISTEN, FRIENDS,
LETÂ´S FACE IT.

WE MIGHT NOT GET THERE
ON TIME.

WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

IÂ´M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH MY CONSCIENCE,

AND, WELL...

IF I CONFESS,
WILL YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?

WEÂ´RE LISTENING.

IÂ´M TRYING TO TELL YOU TO CALL
